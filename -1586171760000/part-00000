Introduced in 1980, it had manual and semi-automatic exposure control whereby the camera would select the correct shutter speed (aperture priority automation). The Nikon F3 series cameras had the most model variations of any Nikon F camera. It was also the first of numerous Nikon F-series cameras to be styled by Italian designer [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Debut of Nikon F3|url=http://imaging.nikon.com/herstory/chronicle/herstory-f3/|website=Nikon|accessdate=30 November 2014|ref=http://imaging.nikon.com/herstory/chronicle/herstory-f3/}}</ref> and to include a red stripe on the handgrip \u2013 a feature that would later become (with variants of stripes and various other shapes) a signature feature of many Nikon cameras.\n\nThe F2AS was a current model when the F3 was introduced, and for a while both were sold concurrently.  The earlier Nikons had developed such a sterling reputation for extreme ruggedness and durability that many Nikon F and F2 owners were initially reluctant to transition to the new F3 from the F2 series, particularly due to the new camera needing batteries to operate. The F3 was superseded by the [[Nikon F4|F4]] in 1988 and the [[Nikon F5|F5]] in 1996.  Despite being superseded by the newer cameras, it remained in production through to 2001, with over 751,000 F3s produced through September 1992.  It continues to be the longest running professional grade Nikon SLR.  Long after production ceased, new bodies in boxes were available throughout the world, so an exact production number is not readily available.\n\n==F3 variants==\n\n==={{anchor|F3HP|F3/T}}F3HP and F3/T===\nInitially, the F3 model with the DE-2 eye-level finder was introduced, soon followed by the popular F3HP, or High Point camera, with the DE-3 High Eyepoint prism/finder. The major advantage of this finder was that the entire viewfinder image could be seen from a distance of 2.5&nbsp;cm from the viewfinder. This made the F3 more usable by those who wear glasses when shooting, or were forced to shoot in high-glare situations while wearing sunglasses.  The only down-side to this was a smaller image through the viewfinder compared to the standard prism. With the exception of the \"P\" spec camera, all viewfinders are completely interchangeable.  The F3 and F3HP retained the flash mount on the rewind dial, which (with flash mounted) obstructed that area of the camera.<ref name=\"Shutterbug\"/>\n\nA significantly more durable, robust titanium version of the F3HP was also offered, called the \"F3/T\", initially in a more natural titanium finish or 'champagne' coloring, and later in a less conspicuous black.   It weighs 20 grams less than the comparable F3.  The champagne offering was introduced in 1982 and was quickly discontinued around 1985, making it the rarer (and costlier on the used market) of the two titanium models.  The F3/T featured titanium clad viewfinders (DE-4), titanium back, titanium top and bottom plates.  It also benefited from the conformal coating of the internal circuit board.  The mechanical specifications between the black finished F3/T and the natural finish F3/T were identical.\n\n[[Image:NikonF3T.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Nikon F3/T made of titanium]]\n\n==={{anchor|F3P|F3 Limited}}F3P===\nNext to be introduced was the F3P in 1983.  Built primarily for use by photojournalists (\"P\"ress), the F3P included additional weathersealing, O-ring gaskets, the MF-6 Auto Film-Stop Back, Type-B Matte focusing screen, a modified Titanium DE-5 pentaprism with ISO-type accessory shoe and no eyepiece blind, rubber-covered waterproof shutter release with a modified lockout and no cable release threads, a round frame counter window with white numerals (some have been seen with blue numerals), and an extended shutter speed operating knob for easier operation in cold or wet environments. The F3P lacked a film door release lock, self-timer and multiple-exposure lever.\n\nA variant of the F3P called the 'F3 Limited' was also sold just in Japan, starting in 1994.  The Limited had special badging, regular film back without the auto-stop feature of the MF-6/6B back, and was otherwise identical to the F3P.  It also came in a wooden presentation box.\n\nNeither camera could use the DX-1 viewfinder of the F3AF body.  Contacts in mirror housing were configured differently than a regular F3 series camera.  On an F3P and F3 Limited, they were used for flash synch and ready light purposes.  On an F3, F3/T, and F3AF, they were used to communicate the exposure meter display information to the LCD inside the DX-1 viewfinder.\n\n===F3H===\n<!-- section header also used as anchor for redirects -->\n[[File:Nikon_F3H_High_Speed_film_camera.jpg|right|thumb|Nikon F3H High Speed 13 Frames per second]]\nThe F3H, a high-speed camera, was introduced for press, sports photography and for the 1998 Nagano Olympics in Japan. However Nikon recently stated its true motivation on its website in that it \"represented Nikon's reaction to the fact that, the previous year, a competitor had released a camera for high-speed continuous shooting that could shoot 10 fps\". Following previous practice with the Nikon F High Speed and the F2H, it featured a fixed pellicle semi-transparent mirror, diverting 30% of the light through to the view finder, allowing the camera and the specially produced MD-4H motor drive to achieve up to 13 frames per second, when the MN-2 nicad battery is used (as opposed to 7.5 frames per second with eight AA alkaline batteries).\n\nThe F3H had the appearance of an F3P modified for high-speed photography; however, under the skin were some advanced techniques to achieve the speeds required, including something Nikon have described as \"the camera and the motor drive predict and control each other's operations, so that certain operations overlap\".\n\nThe MD-4H was essentially a speeded-up MD4, with the gearing increased by 1.5 and the voltage raised to the standard, already capable, motor. There is one additional gold contact pin surrounding the rewind spigot, that joins with the electrical connection on the base of the camera.  The front face of the drive features a slightly extended area with a switch that enables the option of using the drive at a constant 6 frames per second.\n\nProduction was short, official reports from Nikon claiming only around 100 such cameras made, however it is likely that the real number exceeds that by many hundreds, as serial numbers in the high 800's have been noted . Serial numbers on the camera body begin with H9600..., and the front features the signature F3 logo with a H added. Instead of the depth-of-field preview button, it had an extended version of the button which became an aperture opening button for composing purposes.  Metering was done at working aperture, instead of wide-open, as on other F3 bodies. The camera is also unique among all F3's in having a white film take up spool. Like the F3P, the DX-1 viewfinder could not be used on it. When fitted with the MD-4H it is also incompatible with the Magazine Back MF-4 250, Firing Rate Converter MK-1 and Data Back MF-14.\n\nIt was the last specialized high speed film Nikon camera made and somewhat amazingly, it is still the \"fastest\" frame rate SLR (including digital) that Nikon has ever made. The camera is highly collectable, with limited numbers being produced and being the final in a line of the high speed cameras starting with the legendary Nikon S3M.\n\n===F3AF===\n<!-- Section header also used as anchor for redirects -->\nFinally there was the rarely seen 'F3AF', a model which included an autofocus (AF) pentaprism finder (DX-1) capable of autofocusing with two special AF Nikkor lenses\u2014the first of their kind, which included focus motors in the lens bodies.  Those lenses were the AF-80mm f/2.8 Nikkor and the AF-200mm f/3.5 Nikkor.  It was the first autofocus camera to be produced by Nikon, in 1983.\n\nHowever, even while the more successful subsequent Nikon AF design for the F4 and other models put the focus motor in the camera body, the F3AF's in-lens approach foreshadowed in-lens autofocus designs that would later come to dominate the market more than 15 years in the future, such as [[Canon (company)|Canon]]'s USM and Nikon's own Silent Wave Motor (SWM) lenses.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\n==Construction==\nNikon abandoned the earlier mechanically operated shutter of the F2 for a modern, electronically controlled, horizontally traveled metal curtain design. The new shutter proved to be equally reliable and less maintenance-intensive overall, though the decision to retain the horizontal-travel design significantly limited its top flash sync speed (1/80 sec.) compared to other Nikons, some of which used the Copal shutter. This decision forced many disappointed press photographers to use Nikon's semi pro bodies (FM, FE, FM2, FE2 etc.) instead when higher sync speeds were needed, usually for fill flash in daylight situations. The F4 finally solved this sync speed deficiency with Nikon's pro grade SLR offerings with its 250th sync. In contrast to the manually operated F2, the F3's electronic shutter required battery power to operate, although the camera included a small backup mechanical release lever that tripped the shutter at 1/60 sec.\n\nThe F3 continued the high-quality of its predecessors, in some ways surpassing it. Tolerances were exacting, and typically Nikon \u2013 just enough for operation of the camera (with a small allowance for debris), yet not enough to inhibit cold-weather operation at temperatures where lubricants begin to gel. Only the finest quality mechanical and electronic parts were selected, and Nikon insisted that all electronic components be sourced with a guarantee of 20 years of continued supply. Not only did the F3 utilize ball-bearings to mount its shutter and film transport mechanisms, but additional clusters of bearings were added to the film advance to make one of the smoothest operating cameras ever built.<ref name=Shutterbug /> Indeed, resistance is so low when operating the film advance that it is difficult to tell if there is film in the camera.\n\nFor the first time, shutter information was displayed via an internal liquid crystal display (LCD) inside the viewfinder. Aperture information was relayed through Nikon's \"ADR\" (Aperture Direct Readout) which was a window at the top center of the viewfinder that got its information from a micro-prism that read small numbers at the top of the mounted lens, of which type 'AI' (Aperture Indexing) or 'AIS' (Aperture Indexing Shutter Priority) lenses had printed behind the normal aperture numbers. Though widely used today, LCDs were very hi-tech at the time. They proved somewhat difficult to see at night, so Nikon installed a button-operated light for use at night. The LCD is one of the few problem areas of the F3 design, since with age, LCDs lose contrast, blur, and become inoperative after a number of years. Fortunately, unlike modern autofocus cameras with LCD 'Command Center' panels, malfunction of the F3's LCD viewfinder display does not prevent full operation of the camera, since this is accomplished with manual dials and indicators. Many F3 cameras built in the 1980s were never used professionally, and therefore are still in perfect working order, including the LCD.  On early production models the autoexposure lock button, originally a simple push-in part, is often missing; Nikon later redesigned this part so it was securely attached from inside the body.  The later part can be fitted to early bodies but a partial stripdown is required.\n\nThe Nikon F3 was the last in the Nikon series of manual-focus, professional level 35mm SLR cameras. Its production cycle is generally accepted to be from 1980 to 2000 or 2002, close to a record for a high-volume professional camera. Its successor \u2013 the [[Nikon F4|F4]] \u2013 along with operating the two F3AF lens, featured auto-focus and new optional metering and modes, but retained the ability to mount older manual-focus lenses. The F3 was also the last F-Series camera to be offered without an integrated motor drive, making the camera smaller overall than its successors in the F-Series. The lasting appeal of the F3 remains the same as it was at its inception \u2013 a precision tool for those who prefer a less complex, extremely well made camera for continual use in extreme environments.\n\nThe optional motor drive for the F3, known as the MD-4, contained either 8 AA batteries or a special [[NiCd]] battery pack that would be recharged. Its performance surpassed that of past Nikon models, with a capability of 4 frames per second with uninterrupted reflex viewing, or 6 frame/s with the reflex mirror locked up. The integral seamless design of the MD-4 motor drive made it an extremely popular option for many F3 users. A bulk film back could be fitted in lieu of the normal back to the F3. This film back, known as the MF-4, was capable of handling up to 10 meters (33&nbsp;ft) of 35mm film, or 250 exposures.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nImage:F3 AF.jpg|Nikon F3AF\nImage:Nikon F3 1.jpg|Nikon F3 with Nikkor 50mm f/1.8\nImage:Nikon F3 DA2.JPG|Nikon F3 with DA2 Sport Finder\nImage:Nikon F3 2.JPG|Nikon F3 buttons and knobs\nImage:Nikon F3 HP.JPG|Nikon F3 HP\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Kodak DCS-100]], an early digital DSLR system that used F3 bodies for photographic functions.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Nikon F3}}\n*[http://imaging.nikon.com/products/imaging/technology/d-archives/history-f3/index.htm Debut of the Nikon F3, by Nikon]\n*[http://www.mir.com.my/rb/photography/hardwares/classics/nikonf3ver2/index.htm mir.com]\n*[http://www.mir.com.my/rb/photography/hardwares/messageboard/f3message/index.php mir.com]\n*[http://www.camerapedia.org/wiki/Nikon_F3 Nikon F3] at camerapedia\n*[http://www.nikonf3.com/ Nikon F3 Resource including Manuals] at NikonF3.com\n*[http://www.nikon.com/about/feelnikon/recollections/r25_e/index.htm Nikon F3H recollections by Nikon engineer]\n{{Nikon 35mm Film SLR Cameras}}\n\n[[Category:Nikon SLR cameras|F003]]\n[[Category:Nikon F-mount cameras|F003]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Camera model}}\n{{More citations needed|date=March 2014}}\n{{Infobox camera\n| model        = Nikon F3\n| image        = Nikon F3 with HP viewfinder.jpeg\n| caption      = \n| kind         = [[Single lens reflex]]\n| filmformat   = [[135 film|35 mm]]\n| filmsize     = 36 mm \u00d7 24 mm\n| lens         = [[Nikon F-mount]]\n| shutter      = electronically controlled\n| shutterRange = \n| metering     = silicon photodiode light meter, [[Through-the-lens metering|TTL]] metering, EV 1 to EV 18 (f/1.4 at 1s to f/16 at 1/1000s at ASA/ISO 100 and with 50 mm f/1.4 lens\n| emode        = Aperture priority, manual\n| mmode        = 80 percent centerweighted<ref name=Shutterbug>Jason Schneider,  [http://shutterbug.com/equipmentreviews/classic_historical/0407street/ Historical Cameras: Nikon F3] April 2007, Shutterbug, April 2007</ref>\n| fmode        = manual\n| farea        = \n| cont         = \n| viewfinder   = interchangeable eye-level pentaprism\n| magnification= \n| coverage     = \n| speedRange   = \n| DXcoding     = \n| flash        = hot shoe; synch terminal\n| flashcomp    = \n| flbkt        = \n| fsynch       = 1/80s\n| fadvance     = manual; automatic with optional motor drive\n| frewind      = manual; automatic with optional motor drive\n| obp          = \n| odb          = \n| ovf          = \n| omd          = \n| oacc         = \n| complens     = [[Nikon F-mount]] lenses supporting automatic indexing (AI) with some exceptions; F3 dedicated auto-focus lenses\n| compflash    = Dedicated F3 accessory shoe mounted flashes with TTL capability; other hot shoe type flashes with adapter; non-hot shoe flashes with synch cord\n| battery      = \n| dimensions   = \n| weight       = \n| price        = $1.174.90 With 50mm Nikkor f/1.4<ref name=\"popphoto\">Lab Report: Top of line Nikon F3.

Fortunately, unlike modern autofocus cameras with LCD 'Command Center' panels, malfunction of the F3's LCD viewfinder display does not prevent full operation of the camera, since this is accomplished with manual dials and indicators. Many F3 cameras built in the 1980s were never used professionally, and therefore are still in perfect working order, including the LCD.  On early production models the autoexposure lock button, originally a simple push-in part, is often missing; Nikon later redesigned this part so it was securely attached from inside the body.  The later part can be fitted to early bodies but a partial stripdown is required.\n\nThe Nikon F3 was the last in the Nikon series of manual-focus, professional level 35mm SLR cameras. Its production cycle is generally accepted to be from 1980 to 2000 or 2002, close to a record for a high-volume professional camera. Its successor \u2013 the [[Nikon F4|F4]] \u2013 along with operating the two F3AF lens, featured auto-focus and new optional metering and modes, but retained the ability to mount older manual-focus lenses. The F3 was also the last F-Series camera to be offered without an integrated motor drive, making the camera smaller overall than its successors in the F-Series. The lasting appeal of the F3 remains the same as it was at its inception \u2013 a precision tool for those who prefer a less complex, extremely well made camera for continual use in extreme environments.\n\nThe optional motor drive for the F3, known as the MD-4, contained either 8 AA batteries or a special [[NiCd]] battery pack that would be recharged. Its performance surpassed that of past Nikon models, with a capability of 4 frames per second with uninterrupted reflex viewing, or 6 frame/s with the reflex mirror locked up. The integral seamless design of the MD-4 motor drive made it an extremely popular option for many F3 users. A bulk film back could be fitted in lieu of the normal back to the F3. This film back, known as the MF-4, was capable of handling up to 10 meters (33&nbsp;ft) of 35mm film, or 250 exposures.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nImage:F3 AF.jpg|Nikon F3AF\nImage:Nikon F3 1.jpg|Nikon F3 with Nikkor 50mm f/1.8\nImage:Nikon F3 DA2.JPG|Nikon F3 with DA2 Sport Finder\nImage:Nikon F3 2.JPG|Nikon F3 buttons and knobs\nImage:Nikon F3 HP.JPG|Nikon F3 HP\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Kodak DCS-100]], an early digital DSLR system that used F3 bodies for photographic functions.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Nikon F3}}\n*[http://imaging.nikon.com/products/imaging/technology/d-archives/history-f3/index.htm Debut of the Nikon F3, by Nikon]\n*[http://www.mir.com.my/rb/photography/hardwares/classics/nikonf3ver2/index.htm mir.com]\n*[http://www.mir.com.my/rb/photography/hardwares/messageboard/f3message/index.php mir.com]\n*[http://www.camerapedia.org/wiki/Nikon_F3 Nikon F3] at camerapedia\n*[http://www.nikonf3.com/ Nikon F3 Resource including Manuals] at NikonF3.com\n*[http://www.nikon.com/about/feelnikon/recollections/r25_e/index.htm Nikon F3H recollections by Nikon engineer]\n{{Nikon 35mm Film SLR Cameras}}\n\n[[Category:Nikon SLR cameras|F003]]\n[[Category:Nikon F-mount cameras|F003]]\n", "name_user": "Bobn2", "label": "safe", "comment": "I have removed 'In addition, the F4's support of the two special F3AF lenses now permits it to work with new Nikon SWM lenses that were designed long after both the F3 and F4 ceased production.' because it is incorrect - not for the reason that the F4 won't focus AF-S lenses, but that the F\u00a3AF compatibility is not the reason, the F3AF lens contacts and protocol is completely incompatible with AF-S lenses.

Following notable successes in [[sports car racing]] during the mid- to late-1950s \u2014 culminating in winning the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] endurance race and the [[World Sportscar Championship]] title in {{24hLM|1959}} \u2014 the DBR4 was intended to repeat this success in the highest tier of [[Formula racing|open-wheel racing]].\n\nThe DBR4 was largely based on the [[Aston Martin DB3S|DB3S]] sportscar, and borrowed that vehicle's basic chassis and engine layout. Although it was tested as early as 1957, the DBR4 did not make its World Championship debut until the [[1959 Dutch Grand Prix]], driven by [[Roy Salvadori]] and [[Carroll Shelby]]. However, its long gestation period meant that by the time it finally entered competition much of its concept and technology had been superseded, and the car was not a success. The DBR4 was replaced by the lighter [[Aston Martin DBR5]]/250 in early 1960, but when that car also failed to provide competitive results Aston Martin abandoned Formula One to concentrate on their more successful sports car projects.\n\n==Design==\nA potential open-wheeled Aston Martin racing car had been discussed as early as 1955, and a hastily constructed prototype was tested in the Australian and New Zealand races in early 1956, driven by [[Reg Parnell]]. Following successes in this Antipodean experiment, and despite the majority of Aston's racing department being fully occupied with the sports car program, Aston Martin decided to pursue a Formula One entry in earnest. However, the company's emphasis on sports car competitions meant that attention was often diverted from the Formula One program, and development delays were common almost from the outset.\n\n[[File:Aston Martin DBR4 cockpit Donington.jpg|thumb|left|The cockpit of an Aston Martin DBR4, showing the generous proportions of the chassis and details of its spaceframe construction.]]\nBuilding on Aston Martin's established road car and sports racer template, the chassis of the DBR4 was a conventional [[spaceframe]] structure, skinned with aluminium bodywork. Beneath the skin the DBR4's basic design was closely related to the [[Aston Martin DB3S|DB3S]] sports car of 1956, but with its ancillary components more tightly packaged to enclose them in the smaller, single-seater body. Although some manufacturers had started to use [[wind-tunnel]] testing for racing cars, such as the [[Bristol 450]], [[aerodynamics]] as a science was still in its infancy where road vehicles were concerned. As a result of this, although the DBR4's bodywork appeared svelte and streamlined, the effect was ruined by the decision to mount a large air intake on the side of the bonnet, and to install a relatively tall, near-vertical windscreen.\n\nSuspension was handled by [[double wishbone suspension|double wishbones]] with [[coil spring]]s and telescopic [[Shock absorber|dampers]] at the front, and a [[de Dion tube]] system with [[torsion bar]] springs at the rear. While this arrangement had been state-of-the-art in the early years of the 1950s, by the time that the DBR4 made its first public appearance most racing car manufacturers were moving to all-round [[independent suspension]], offering better handling, traction and road-holding than the older system employed at the rear of the Aston.  The DBR4 was the last new Grand Prix car to use the de Dion system. This same suspension system would be adapted to the [[Aston Martin DBR3|DBR3]] sports car which was being developed at the same time as the DBR4, but would be abandoned less than a year later when the DBR3 was considered a failure.  To bring the car to a halt, [[Lucas Industries#Girling|Girling]] [[disc brake]]s were fitted all round.\n\nThe DBR4 also shared the basic [[Overhead camshaft#Double overhead camshaft|double overhead camshaft]] [[straight-6]] Aston Martin engine design with its brethren, but sleeved to reduce its capacity to 2.5-litres. Although [[Tadek Marek]]'s design was a reliable and powerful unit in its 3.7-litre road car form, the reduced capacity racing motor was hard-pressed to cope with the heavy chassis and poor aerodynamics, and frequent engine failures blighted the DBR4's brief racing career. Aston Martin claimed a {{convert|280|bhp|kW|-1|abbr=on}} output for the DBR4's engine. However, it was common practice at the time to overquote engine power, and a more realistic value is closer to {{convert|250|bhp|kW|-1|abbr=on}}. This value is still higher than that provided by the [[Coventry Climax]] ''FPF'' [[straight-4]], used by contemporary manufacturers such as [[Team Lotus|Lotus]] and [[Cooper Car Company|Cooper]], but the Aston Martin engine weighed appreciably more. The engine drove the rear wheels through a proprietary [[David Brown Ltd.|David Brown]] gearbox, provided by Aston Martin's owners.\n\nA total of four Aston Martin DBR4/250s were built between 1957 and 1959, with three surviving to date. Recognising their failings, the Aston Martin race team reworked the DBR4 into the DBR5 for the {{F1|1960}} season. The DBR5 was smaller and lighter, and engine modifications meant that the power output was finally close to the figure originally claimed by the Aston Martin workshop. The DBR5 also boasted all-independent suspension, but results did not improve from those of the DBR4 and both DBR5s were eventually broken up.\n\n==Competition career==\n[[File:Aston Martin DBR4 Donington pits.jpg|thumb|right|The Aston Martin DBR4 had a sleek bodywork shape, broken by large air intakes and upright windscreen.]]\nThe Aston Martin DBR4/250 was unveiled to the public in April 1959, and made its competition debut on 2 May in the non-Championship [[BRDC International Trophy]] race at [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]]. Two cars were entered, for works drivers [[Roy Salvadori]] and [[Carroll Shelby]]. Salvadori immediately began to show some promise in the car, posting third fastest time in qualifying, beaten only by fellow Britons [[Stirling Moss]] and [[Tony Brooks (racing driver)|Tony Brooks]], driving a [[British Racing Partnership|BRP]] [[BRM P25]] and works [[Ferrari 246 Dino]] respectively. Shelby also posted some fast lap times, taking sixth place. In the race both Brooks and Moss retired with mechanical problems, but the Astons performed faultlessly for the majority of the distance, before Shelby's oil pump failed two laps from the finish. He placed sixth, two laps down. However, Salvadori was well-placed and competing hard for the lead. He posted the fastest lap of the race, en route to finishing second behind [[Jack Brabham]]'s works Cooper-Climax. Unfortunately for Aston Martin, the DBR4's debut performance flattered to deceive.\n\n[[File:Aston Martin DBR4 Donington paddock.jpg|thumb|left|A DBR4 is push-started in the paddock at Donington Park, 2007.]]\nAt the DBR4's World Championship debut in the [[1959 Dutch Grand Prix]] on 31 May, Shelby and Salvadori could only manage 10th and 13th fastest in qualification, respectively. During the race both cars succumbed to engine problems in the early laps and failed to finish. Further delays and shifted priorities meant that the light green Astons only appeared at a further three races of the [[1959 Formula One season]]. The DBR4s failed to score even a single point during this time; their best results being a pair of 6th places for Salvadori, taken at the [[1959 British Grand Prix|British]] and [[1959 Portuguese Grand Prix|Portuguese]] rounds. Following a second disappointing outing in the BRDC International Trophy (Trintignant was tenth and Salvadori's engine expired on lap 4), a solitary DBR4 appeared in practice for the [[1960 Dutch Grand Prix]], entered for Salvadori when the DBR5 was not ready. The car was saved further possible embarrassment when a starting money dispute caused Aston Martin to withdraw prior to the start.\n\nThe coda to the DBR4's racing career came in mid-1960, when a car was shipped to Australia for local racers [[Lex Davison]] and [[Bib Stillwell]] to compete in the Australian and New Zealand national championship [[Formula Libre]] races. Fitted with a 3.0-litre engine the car performed much better than had been the case during its brief Formula One life, and Davison took second place in the [[1960 Australian Grand Prix]]. To reflect the increase in engine capacity this car was officially known as the ''DBR4/300''. Stillwell retained the DBR4/300 until the end of the 1962\u201363 season.\n\n==Complete Formula One World Championship results==\n([[:Template:F1 driver results legend 2|key]])\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%\"\n!

This value is still higher than that provided by the [[Coventry Climax]] ''FPF'' [[straight-4]], used by contemporary manufacturers such as [[Team Lotus|Lotus]] and [[Cooper Car Company|Cooper]], but the Aston Martin engine weighed appreciably more. The engine drove the rear wheels through a proprietary [[David Brown Ltd.|David Brown]] gearbox, provided by Aston Martin's owners.\n\nA total of four Aston Martin DBR4/250s were built between 1957 and 1959, with three surviving to date. Recognising their failings, the Aston Martin race team reworked the DBR4 into the DBR5 for the {{F1|1960}} season. The DBR5 was smaller and lighter, and engine modifications meant that the power output was finally close to the figure originally claimed by the Aston Martin workshop. The DBR5 also boasted all-independent suspension, but results did not improve from those of the DBR4 and both DBR5s were eventually broken up.\n\n==Competition career==\n[[File:Aston Martin DBR4 Donington pits.jpg|thumb|right|The Aston Martin DBR4 had a sleek bodywork shape, broken by large air intakes and upright windscreen.]]\nThe Aston Martin DBR4/250 was unveiled to the public in April 1959, and made its competition debut on 2 May in the non-Championship [[BRDC International Trophy]] race at [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]]. Two cars were entered, for works drivers [[Roy Salvadori]] and [[Carroll Shelby]]. Salvadori immediately began to show some promise in the car, posting third fastest time in qualifying, beaten only by fellow Britons [[Stirling Moss]] and [[Tony Brooks (racing driver)|Tony Brooks]], driving a [[British Racing Partnership|BRP]] [[BRM P25]] and works [[Ferrari 246 Dino]] respectively. Shelby also posted some fast lap times, taking sixth place. In the race both Brooks and Moss retired with mechanical problems, but the Astons performed faultlessly for the majority of the distance, before Shelby's oil pump failed two laps from the finish. He placed sixth, two laps down. However, Salvadori was well-placed and competing hard for the lead. He posted the fastest lap of the race, en route to finishing second behind [[Jack Brabham]]'s works Cooper-Climax. Unfortunately for Aston Martin, the DBR4's debut performance flattered to deceive.\n\n[[File:Aston Martin DBR4 Donington paddock.jpg|thumb|left|A DBR4 is push-started in the paddock at Donington Park, 2007.]]\nAt the DBR4's World Championship debut in the [[1959 Dutch Grand Prix]] on 31 May, Shelby and Salvadori could only manage 10th and 13th fastest in qualification, respectively. During the race both cars succumbed to engine problems in the early laps and failed to finish. Further delays and shifted priorities meant that the light green Astons only appeared at a further three races of the [[1959 Formula One season]]. The DBR4s failed to score even a single point during this time; their best results being a pair of 6th places for Salvadori, taken at the [[1959 British Grand Prix|British]] and [[1959 Portuguese Grand Prix|Portuguese]] rounds. Following a second disappointing outing in the BRDC International Trophy (Trintignant was tenth and Salvadori's engine expired on lap 4), a solitary DBR4 appeared in practice for the [[1960 Dutch Grand Prix]], entered for Salvadori when the DBR5 was not ready. The car was saved further possible embarrassment when a starting money dispute caused Aston Martin to withdraw prior to the start.\n\nThe coda to the DBR4's racing career came in mid-1960, when a car was shipped to Australia for local racers [[Lex Davison]] and [[Bib Stillwell]] to compete in the Australian and New Zealand national championship [[Formula Libre]] races. Fitted with a 3.0-litre engine the car performed much better than had been the case during its brief Formula One life, and Davison took second place in the [[1960 Australian Grand Prix]]. To reflect the increase in engine capacity this car was officially known as the ''DBR4/300''. Stillwell retained the DBR4/300 until the end of the 1962\u201363 season.\n\n==Complete Formula One World Championship results==\n([[:Template:F1 driver results legend 2|key]])\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%\"\n!

In the example (right), the aircraft travelling westward from North America to Japan is following a great-circle route extending northward towards the [[Arctic]] region. The apparent curve of the route is a result of distortion when plotted onto a conventional map projection and makes the route appear to be longer than it really is.  Stretching a string between  North America and Japan on a globe will demonstrate why this really is the shortest route despite appearances.\n\nThe actual flight length is the length of the track flown across the ground in practice, which is usually longer than the ideal great-circle and is influenced by a number of factors such as the need to avoid bad weather, wind direction and speed, fuel economy, navigational restrictions and other requirements. In the example, easterly flights from Japan to North America are shown taking a longer, more southerly, route than the shorter great-circle; this is to take advantage of the favourable [[jet stream]], a fast, high-altitude tail-wind, that assists the aircraft along its ground track saving more time and fuel than the geographically shortest route.\n\n===Air time versus schedule times===\nAir time is the elapsed time that the aircraft is airborne, regardless of what [[time-zone]] the flight began and ended in.\n\nSchedule time is the difference between the scheduled local time at the origin and the scheduled local time at the destination and usually differs from the actual time in the air as it is affected by the local time zones. Local clock time flying westward, or \"chasing the sun\", is slowed,<ref>Dik A. Daso Doolittle: Aerospace Visionary 2003 - Page 116  \"While flying west, a pilot actually lengthens her day by \u201cchasing the sun.\u201d Hence, there are effectively three hours more daylight than darkness on this east-to-west flight.\"</ref> while local clock time flying eastbound is sped up.  However, flights over the [[International Date Line]] located at approximately 180<sup>o</sup> E in the Pacific will subtract 24 hours from the schedule time going eastwards and add 24 hours going westwards.  For example, the eastward flight shown in the example from Japan to North America will have a scheduled time of arrival earlier than the departure time, while from North America to Japan the flight will take a whole day longer by local time; the actual flying time in both cases being the same or similar.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Endurance (aeronautics)]]\n* [[Range (aeronautics)]]\n* [[List of regional airliners]]\n* [[International flight]]\n* [[Non-stop flight]]\n* [[Flight distance record]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.greatcirclemapper.net The Great Circle Mapper] Displays Great Circle flight routes on a Map And calculates distance and duration\n* [http://www.flighttime-calculator.com/ Flight-time and -distance calculator]\n* [http://www.airmilescalculator.com/ Air Miles Calculator]\n* [https://www.flight-durations.com/ Flight Duration Calculator]\n* [https://flight-distance.com/ Flight Distance Calculator] Flight routes duration and Great Circle Mapper\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Flight Length}}\n[[Category:Civil aviation]]\n", "text_old": "{{Redirect|Long Haul|other uses|The Long Haul (disambiguation){{!}}The Long Haul}}\n\nIn [[aviation]], the '''flight length''' is defined as the distance of a flight.

length===\n[[File:Greatcircle Jetstream routes.svg|thumb|400px|Airline routes between [[San Francisco]] and [[Tokyo]] following the most direct great circle (top) westward, and following a longer-distance jet stream route (bottom) when heading eastward]]\n\nThe absolute distance between two points is the [[great-circle distance]], which is always the shortest geographical route.  In the example (right), the aircraft travelling westward from North America to Japan is following a great-circle route extending northward towards the [[Arctic]] region. The apparent curve of the route is a result of distortion when plotted onto a conventional map projection and makes the route appear to be longer than it really is.  Stretching a string between  North America and Japan on a globe will demonstrate why this really is the shortest route despite appearances.\n\nThe actual flight length is the length of the track flown across the ground in practice, which is usually longer than the ideal great-circle and is influenced by a number of factors such as the need to avoid bad weather, wind direction and speed, fuel economy, navigational restrictions and other requirements. In the example, easterly flights from Japan to North America are shown taking a longer, more southerly, route than the shorter great-circle; this is to take advantage of the favourable [[jet stream]], a fast, high-altitude tail-wind, that assists the aircraft along its ground track saving more time and fuel than the geographically shortest route.\n\n===Air time versus schedule times===\nAir time is the elapsed time that the aircraft is airborne, regardless of what [[time-zone]] the flight began and ended in.\n\nSchedule time is the difference between the scheduled local time at the origin and the scheduled local time at the destination and usually differs from the actual time in the air as it is affected by the local time zones. Local clock time flying westward, or \"chasing the sun\", is slowed,<ref>Dik A. Daso Doolittle: Aerospace Visionary 2003 - Page 116  \"While flying west, a pilot actually lengthens her day by \u201cchasing the sun.\u201d Hence, there are effectively three hours more daylight than darkness on this east-to-west flight.\"</ref> while local clock time flying eastbound is sped up.  However, flights over the [[International Date Line]] located at approximately 180<sup>o</sup> E in the Pacific will subtract 24 hours from the schedule time going eastwards and add 24 hours going westwards.  For example, the eastward flight shown in the example from Japan to North America will have a scheduled time of arrival earlier than the departure time, while from North America to Japan the flight will take a whole day longer by local time; the actual flying time in both cases being the same or similar.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Endurance (aeronautics)]]\n* [[Range (aeronautics)]]\n* [[List of regional airliners]]\n* [[International flight]]\n* [[Non-stop flight]]\n* [[Flight distance record]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.greatcirclemapper.net The Great Circle Mapper] Displays Great Circle flight routes on a Map And calculates distance and duration\n* [http://www.flighttime-calculator.com/ Flight-time and -distance calculator]\n* [http://www.airmilescalculator.com/ Air Miles Calculator]\n* [https://www.flight-durations.com/ Flight Duration Calculator]\n* [https://flight-distance.com/ Flight Distance Calculator] Flight routes duration and Great Circle Mapper\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Flight Length}}\n[[Category:Civil aviation]]\n", "name_user": "103.240.163.37", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eLongest commercial flight:the page was wrong/outdated)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_length"}

Through Bigwig's bravery and loyalty, and Hazel's ingenuity, the Watership Down rabbits seal the fate of the Efrafan general by unleashing the Nuthanger Farm watchdog. As the Efrafans flee in terror, Woundwort, despite being greatly wounded in his battle with Bigwig, refuses to back down and leaps at the dog.

Though Hazel is not particularly large or powerful, he is loyal, brave and a quick thinker. He sees the good in each individual, and what they bring to the table; in so doing, he makes sure no one gets left behind, thus earning the respect and loyalty of his warren. He often relies on Fiver's advice, and trusts in his brother's instincts immensely.\n*'''Fiver:''' A [[runt]] rabbit whose name literally means \"Little Thousand\" (rabbits have a single word, \"hrair\", for all numbers greater than four; Fiver's name in Lapine, ''Hrairoo'', indicates that he is the smallest of a litter of five or more rabbits)<ref>{{cite book |last= Adams |first= Richard |title= Watership Down |location= New York |publisher= Scribner |edition= 1st Scribner trade paperback |year= 2005 |page= 5 |isbn=0-7432-7770-8 |quote= There were probably more than five rabbits in the litter when Fiver was born, but his name, ''Hrairoo'', means \"Little Thousand\"{{snd}} i.e. the little one of a lot or, as they say of pigs, the \"runt.\"}}</ref> and Hazel's younger brother. As a seer, he has visions and strong instincts. Fiver is one of the most intelligent rabbits in the group. He is shy, quiet, kind and intuitive with common sense, and though he does not directly act as a leader, the others listen to and follow his advice. Vilthuril becomes his mate.\n*'''Bigwig:''' An ex-Owsla officer, and the largest and bravest rabbit of the group. His name in Lapine is ''Thlayli'', which literally means \"Fur-head\" and refers to the shock of fur on the back of his head. Though he is powerful and fierce, he is also shown to be cunning in his own way when he devises a plan to defeat the larger and stronger General Woundwort. His final battle with Woundwort leaves him severely wounded, but he survives and becomes the leader of Hazel's Owsla.\n*'''Blackberry:''' A clever buck rabbit with black-tipped ears. He is often capable of understanding concepts the other rabbits find incomprehensible. He realises, for instance, that wood floats, and the rabbits use this tactic twice to travel on water. He also works out how to dismantle the snare that almost kills Bigwig, saving him. He is one of Hazel's most trusted advisors, given the task to plan a way to rescue does from Efrafa.\n*'''Holly:''' Former captain of the Sandleford Warren Owsla, escapes with Bluebell when his warren is destroyed by men. He is near death when he finds the warren at Watership Down, but is nursed back to health and becomes one of Hazel's most trusted companions.\n*'''Bluebell:''' Buck rabbit who escapes with Holly during the destruction of Sandleford and tells jokes to cope and help Holly recover from the mental strain of seeing the Sandleford warren destroyed. He will often jokingly speak in rhyme.\n*'''Strawberry:''' Buck from Cowslip's warren who leaves with the Watership Down rabbits after his doe is killed by a snare. Strawberry is strong and sleek but not as hardy as the other rabbits given his warren upbringing but learns quickly and gets along well with the group. It is for this reason that he is selected to represent the rabbits on an expedition to Efrafa.\n*'''Haystack:''' One of the hutch rabbits who escapes in order to live with the wild rabbits.\n*'''Buckthorn:''' A strong buck who was expected to be part of the Sandleford Owsla once he reached maturity.\n*'''Hawkbit:''' Described in the book as a \"rather stupid rabbit\" but is accepted by Hazel regardless.\n*'''Dandelion:''' A buck rabbit notable for his storytelling ability and speed. He is instrumental in luring the Nuthanger Farm dog into the Efrafans during the siege of Watership Down.\n*'''Silver:''' A strong buck rabbit, given his name for his silver-grey fur, he fights alongside Bigwig and helps defend the rabbits during their journey. He is teased for his silver fur at the Sandleford warren which is one of the reasons he was more willing to leave.\n*'''Pipkin:''' A small and timid buck rabbit, who looks to Hazel for guidance and protection. Hazel encourages him, and Pipkin grows loyal to Hazel. He proves to be a constant comforter, particularly for Holly after the destruction of Sandleford warren. His name is Hlao-roo in Lapine.\n*'''Hyzenthlay:''' A doe who lives in Efrafa and assists Bigwig in arranging for the liberation of its inhabitants. General Woundwort, who suspects her of fomenting dissension, orders his guards to keep a close eye on her. She escapes Efrafa with Bigwig. Like Fiver, she has visions. Her name means literally \"shine-dew-fur\", or \"fur shining like dew\".\n*'''Vilthuril:''' A doe who lives in Efrafa. Similar to Fiver and Hyzenthlay, it is understood that she has visions and is a seer. She escapes Efrafa with Bigwig, Hyzenthlay and the other does. She becomes Fiver's mate and is said to be the only one to understand him as well as Hazel.\n*'''Blackavar:''' A rabbit with dark fur who tries to escape from Efrafa but is apprehended, mutilated, and put on display to discourage further escape attempts. When he is liberated by Bigwig, he quickly proves himself an expert tracker and ranger, and also shows himself to be an effective fighter when the Efrafan rabbits attack the warren. [[File:Chroicocephalus ridibundus (summer).jpg|thumb|right|Kehaar is a [[black-headed gull]] (''Chroicocephalus ridibundus''; pictured with summer plumage)]]\n*'''Kehaar:''' A [[black-headed gull]] who is forced, by an injured wing, to take refuge on Watership Down, and befriends the rabbits when they help him. He is characterised by his frequent impatience, guttural accent and unusual phrasing. After discovering the Efrafa warren and helping the rabbits, he rejoins his colony, but promises to visit. According to Adams, Kehaar was based on a fighter from the [[Norwegian Resistance]] in [[World War II]].<ref name= \"Intro\">Adams, Richard. \"Introduction.\" ''Watership Down'', [[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner]] U.S. edition, 2005. {{ISBN|0-7432-7770-8}}.</ref>\n*'''The Mouse:''' Never named, the mouse is a resident of Watership Down before the arrival of the rabbits. While rabbits usually despise mice and other rodents, who tend to be liars and untrustworthy according to Bigwig, Hazel kindly saves the mouse from a [[kestrel]]. This action allies the mice and rabbits on Watership Down, and the same mouse later warns them of General Woundwort's intended surprise attack, thus saving many lives.\n*'''General Woundwort:''' The main [[antagonist]] of the novel, a fearless, cunning and brutally efficient rabbit who was orphaned at a young age, Woundwort founded the Efrafa warren and is its tyrannical chief. Though larger and stronger than Bigwig, he lacks mercy and kindness. He even leads an attack to destroy the Watership warren as an act of revenge against Bigwig stealing does from Efrafa, which is narrowly defeated by Hazel's ingenuity and Bigwig's bravery. After his apparent death fighting the Nuthanger farm dog, he lives on in rabbit legend as a [[bogeyman]].\n*'''Captain Campion:''' Woundwort's most trusted subordinate, Campion is a loyal, brave and clever officer. After Woundwort disappears, he becomes the Chief Rabbit of Efrafa and reforms it, making peace with the Watership rabbits.\n*'''Vervain:''' The head of the Council police in Efrafa, said to be one of the most hated rabbits in the warren. When Woundwort's forces storm the Honeycomb, he is ordered by Woundwort to kill Fiver, but Fiver's supernatural calmness and prophecising of his (Vervain's) death terrify him into fleeing, and he is never seen again.\n*'''Frith:''' A god-figure who created the world and promised that rabbits would always be allowed to thrive. In Lapine, his name literally means \"the sun\".\n*'''El-ahrairah:''' A rabbit [[trickster]] folk hero, who is the protagonist of nearly all of the rabbits' stories. He represents what every rabbit wants to be; smart, devious, tricky, and devoted to the well-being of his warren. In Lapine, his name is a contraction of the phrase ''Elil-hrair-rah'', which means \"prince with a thousand enemies\". His stories of cleverness (and excessive hubris) are similar to [[Br'er Rabbit]] and [[Anansi]]. His name is pronounced with the same cadence as the phrase \"Never say die\", thus, \"El-a-hrai-rah\".\n*'''Prince Rainbow:''' A god-figure who serves as a foil to El-ahrairah. He attempts to rein in El-ahrairah several times, but is always outsmarted by the rabbit.\n*'''Rabscuttle:''' Another mythical folk hero, Rabscuttle is El-ahrairah's second in command and the Owsla leader. He participates in many of the El-ahrairah's capers. He is considered to be almost as clever as his chief.\n*'''Black Rabbit of Inl\u00e9:''' A sombre [[ghost|phantom]] servant of the god Frith who appears in rabbit [[folklore]] as a kind of analogue to the [[Death (personification)|grim reaper]], and similarly ensures all rabbits die at their predestined time. \"Inl\u00e9\" is the Lapine term for the moon or darkness.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Watership Down|last=Adams|first=Richard|publisher=Scribner|date=1972 (This edition 2005)|isbn=978-0-7432-7770-9|location=New York, London, Toronto, Sydney|pages=1\u2013476}}</ref>\n\n==Lapine language==\n{{main|Lapine language}}\n\n\"Lapine\" is a [[fictional language]] created by author [[Richard Adams]] for the novel, where it is spoken by the rabbit characters.

This theme derives from the author's exposure to the works of [[mythologist]] [[Joseph Campbell]], especially his study of [[comparative mythology]], ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]'' (1949), and in particular, Campbell's \"[[monomyth]]\" theory, also based on [[Carl Jung]]'s view of the unconscious mind, that \"all the stories in the world are really one story.\"<ref name=\"CR-Bridgman\">{{cite journal|last=Bridgman|first=Joan|date=August 2000|title=Richard Adams at Eighty|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/RICHARD+ADAMS+AT+EIGHTY.-a064752236|journal=[[Contemporary Review|The Contemporary Review]]|publisher=The Contemporary Review Company Limited|volume=277|issue=1615|page=108|issn=0010-7565|via=The Free Library}}</ref>\n\nThe concept of the hero has invited comparisons between ''Watership Down's'' characters and those in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' and [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]''.<ref name=\"masterplots\" /> Hazel's courage, Bigwig's strength, Blackberry's ingenuity and craftiness, and Dandelion's and Bluebell's poetry and storytelling all have parallels in the [[epic poetry|epic poem]] ''Odyssey''.<ref name=\"rothen\">{{cite journal | last = Rothen | first = Kathleen J. |author2=Beverly Langston | title = Hazel, Fiver, Odysseus, and You: An Odyssey into Critical Thinking | journal = The English Journal | volume = 76 | issue = 3 | pages = 56\u201359 | publisher = [[National Council of Teachers of English]] |date=March 1987 | issn = 1544-6166}}</ref> Kenneth Kitchell declared, \"Hazel stands in the tradition of [[Odysseus]], [[Aeneas]], and others\".<ref name=\"kitchell\">{{cite journal | last = Kitchell, Jr. | first = Kenneth F. | title = The Shrinking of the Epic Hero: From Homer to Richard Adams's Watership Down | journal = Classical and Modern Literature: A Quarterly | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 13\u201330 | date = Fall 1986 | issn = 0197-2227}}</ref> [[J.

Hazel sends a small embassy, led by Holly, to Efrafa to present their request for does.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Adams |first1=Richard |title=Watership Down |date=1974 |publisher=Penguin Books |location=England, UK |isbn=0-14-003958-9 |pages=186\u2013205}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, Hazel and Pipkin, the smallest member of the group, scout the nearby Nuthanger Farm, where they find two pairs of hutch rabbits. Despite their uncertainty about living wild, the hutch rabbits are willing to come to Watership. Hazel leads a raid on the farm the next day, during which he rescues both does but only one of the bucks, and at the expense of badly injuring Hazel's hind-leg. When the emissary returns soon after, Hazel and his rabbits learn that Efrafa is a [[police state]] led by the [[despotism|despotic]] General Woundwort.

Through Bigwig's bravery and loyalty, and Hazel's ingenuity, the Watership Down rabbits seal the fate of the Efrafan general by unleashing the Nuthanger Farm watchdog. As the Efrafans flee in terror, Woundwort, despite being greatly wounded in his battle with Bigwig, refuses to back down and leaps at the dog. His body is never found, and at least one of his former followers continues to believe in his survival.

Though Hazel is not particularly large or powerful, he is loyal, brave and a quick thinker. He sees the good in each individual, and what they bring to the table; in so doing, he makes sure no one gets left behind, thus earning the respect and loyalty of his warren. He often relies on Fiver's advice, and trusts in his brother's instincts immensely.\n*'''Fiver:''' A [[runt]] rabbit whose name literally means \"Little Thousand\" (rabbits have a single word, \"hrair\", for all numbers greater than four; Fiver's name in Lapine, ''Hrairoo'', indicates that he is the smallest of a litter of five or more rabbits)<ref>{{cite book |last= Adams |first= Richard |title= Watership Down |location= New York |publisher= Scribner |edition= 1st Scribner trade paperback |year= 2005 |page= 5 |isbn=0-7432-7770-8 |quote= There were probably more than five rabbits in the litter when Fiver was born, but his name, ''Hrairoo'', means \"Little Thousand\"{{snd}} i.e. the little one of a lot or, as they say of pigs, the \"runt.\"}}</ref> and Hazel's younger brother. As a seer, he has visions and strong instincts. Fiver is one of the most intelligent rabbits in the group. He is shy, quiet, kind and intuitive with common sense, and though he does not directly act as a leader, the others listen to and follow his advice. Vilthuril becomes his mate.\n*'''Bigwig:''' An ex-Owsla officer, and the largest and bravest rabbit of the group. His name in Lapine is ''Thlayli'', which literally means \"Fur-head\" and refers to the shock of fur on the back of his head. Though he is powerful and fierce, he is also shown to be cunning in his own way when he devises a plan to defeat the larger and stronger General Woundwort. His final battle with Woundwort leaves him severely wounded, but he survives and becomes the leader of Hazel's Owsla.\n*'''Blackberry:''' A clever buck rabbit with black-tipped ears. He is often capable of understanding concepts the other rabbits find incomprehensible. He realises, for instance, that wood floats, and the rabbits use this tactic twice to travel on water. He also works out how to dismantle the snare that almost kills Bigwig, saving him. He is one of Hazel's most trusted advisors, given the task to plan a way to rescue does from Efrafa.\n*'''Holly:''' Former captain of the Sandleford Warren Owsla, escapes with Bluebell when his warren is destroyed by men. He is near death when he finds the warren at Watership Down, but is nursed back to health and becomes one of Hazel's most trusted companions.\n*'''Bluebell:''' Buck rabbit who escapes with Holly during the destruction of Sandleford and tells jokes to cope and help Holly recover from the mental strain of seeing the Sandleford warren destroyed. He will often jokingly speak in rhyme.\n*'''Strawberry:''' Buck from Cowslip's warren who leaves with the Watership Down rabbits after his doe is killed by a snare. Strawberry is strong and sleek but not as hardy as the other rabbits given his warren upbringing but learns quickly and gets along well with the group. It is for this reason that he is selected to represent the rabbits on an expedition to Efrafa.\n*'''Haystack:''' One of the hutch rabbits who escapes in order to live with the wild rabbits.\n*'''Buckthorn:''' A strong buck who was expected to be part of the Sandleford Owsla once he reached maturity.\n*'''Hawkbit:''' Described in the book as a \"rather stupid rabbit\" but is accepted by Hazel regardless.\n*'''Dandelion:''' A buck rabbit notable for his storytelling ability and speed. He is instrumental in luring the Nuthanger Farm dog into the Efrafans during the siege of Watership Down.\n*'''Silver:''' A strong buck rabbit, given his name for his silver-grey fur, he fights alongside Bigwig and helps defend the rabbits during their journey. He is teased for his silver fur at the Sandleford warren which is one of the reasons he was more willing to leave.\n*'''Pipkin:''' A small and timid buck rabbit, who looks to Hazel for guidance and protection. Hazel encourages him, and Pipkin grows loyal to Hazel. He proves to be a constant comforter, particularly for Holly after the destruction of Sandleford warren. His name is Hlao-roo in Lapine.\n*'''Hyzenthlay:''' A doe who lives in Efrafa and assists Bigwig in arranging for the liberation of its inhabitants. General Woundwort, who suspects her of fomenting dissension, orders his guards to keep a close eye on her. She escapes Efrafa with Bigwig. Like Fiver, she has visions. Her name means literally \"shine-dew-fur\", or \"fur shining like dew\".\n*'''Vilthuril:''' A doe who lives in Efrafa. Similar to Fiver and Hyzenthlay, it is understood that she has visions and is a seer. She escapes Efrafa with Bigwig, Hyzenthlay and the other does. She becomes Fiver's mate and is said to be the only one to understand him as well as Hazel.\n*'''Blackavar:''' A rabbit with dark fur who tries to escape from Efrafa but is apprehended, mutilated, and put on display to discourage further escape attempts. When he is liberated by Bigwig, he quickly proves himself an expert tracker and ranger, and also shows himself to be an effective fighter when the Efrafan rabbits attack the warren. [[File:Chroicocephalus ridibundus (summer).jpg|thumb|right|Kehaar is a [[black-headed gull]] (''Chroicocephalus ridibundus''; pictured with summer plumage)]]\n*'''Kehaar:''' A [[black-headed gull]] who is forced, by an injured wing, to take refuge on Watership Down, and befriends the rabbits when they help him. He is characterised by his frequent impatience, guttural accent and unusual phrasing. After discovering the Efrafa warren and helping the rabbits, he rejoins his colony, but promises to visit. According to Adams, Kehaar was based on a fighter from the [[Norwegian Resistance]] in [[World War II]].<ref name= \"Intro\">Adams, Richard. \"Introduction.\" ''Watership Down'', [[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner]] U.S. edition, 2005. {{ISBN|0-7432-7770-8}}.</ref>\n*'''The Mouse:''' Never named, the mouse is a resident of Watership Down before the arrival of the rabbits. While rabbits usually despise mice and other rodents, who tend to be liars and untrustworthy according to Bigwig, Hazel kindly saves the mouse from a [[kestrel]]. This action allies the mice and rabbits on Watership Down, and the same mouse later warns them of General Woundwort's intended surprise attack, thus saving many lives.\n*'''General Woundwort:''' The main [[antagonist]] of the novel, a fearless, cunning and brutally efficient rabbit who was orphaned at a young age, Woundwort founded the Efrafa warren and is its tyrannical chief. Though larger and stronger than Bigwig, he lacks mercy and kindness. He even leads an attack to destroy the Watership warren as an act of revenge against Bigwig stealing does from Efrafa, which is narrowly defeated by Hazel's ingenuity and Bigwig's bravery. After his apparent death fighting the Nuthanger farm dog, he lives on in rabbit legend as a [[bogeyman]].\n*'''Captain Campion:''' Woundwort's most trusted subordinate, Campion is a loyal, brave and clever officer. After Woundwort disappears, he becomes the Chief Rabbit of Efrafa and reforms it, making peace with the Watership rabbits.\n*'''Vervain:''' The head of the Council police in Efrafa, said to be one of the most hated rabbits in the warren. When Woundwort's forces storm the Honeycomb, he is ordered by Woundwort to kill Fiver, but Fiver's supernatural calmness and prophecising of his (Vervain's) death terrify him into fleeing, and he is never seen again.\n*'''Frith:''' A god-figure who created the world and promised that rabbits would always be allowed to thrive. In Lapine, his name literally means \"the sun\".\n*'''El-ahrairah:''' A rabbit [[trickster]] folk hero, who is the protagonist of nearly all of the rabbits' stories. He represents what every rabbit wants to be; smart, devious, tricky, and devoted to the well-being of his warren. In Lapine, his name is a contraction of the phrase ''Elil-hrair-rah'', which means \"prince with a thousand enemies\". His stories of cleverness (and excessive hubris) are similar to [[Br'er Rabbit]] and [[Anansi]]. His name is pronounced with the same cadence as the phrase \"Never say die\", thus, \"El-a-hrai-rah\".\n*'''Prince Rainbow:''' A god-figure who serves as a foil to El-ahrairah. He attempts to rein in El-ahrairah several times, but is always outsmarted by the rabbit.\n*'''Rabscuttle:''' Another mythical folk hero, Rabscuttle is El-ahrairah's second in command and the Owsla leader. He participates in many of the El-ahrairah's capers. He is considered to be almost as clever as his chief.\n*'''Black Rabbit of Inl\u00e9:''' A sombre [[ghost|phantom]] servant of the god Frith who appears in rabbit [[folklore]] as a kind of analogue to the [[Death (personification)|grim reaper]], and similarly ensures all rabbits die at their predestined time. \"Inl\u00e9\" is the Lapine term for the moon or darkness.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Watership Down|last=Adams|first=Richard|publisher=Scribner|date=1972 (This edition 2005)|isbn=978-0-7432-7770-9|location=New York, London, Toronto, Sydney|pages=1\u2013476}}</ref>\n\n==Lapine language==\n{{main|Lapine language}}\n\n\"Lapine\" is a [[fictional language]] created by author [[Richard Adams]] for the novel, where it is spoken by the rabbit characters.

This theme derives from the author's exposure to the works of [[mythologist]] [[Joseph Campbell]], especially his study of [[comparative mythology]], ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]'' (1949), and in particular, Campbell's \"[[monomyth]]\" theory, also based on [[Carl Jung]]'s view of the unconscious mind, that \"all the stories in the world are really one story.\"<ref name=\"CR-Bridgman\">{{cite journal|last=Bridgman|first=Joan|date=August 2000|title=Richard Adams at Eighty|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/RICHARD+ADAMS+AT+EIGHTY.-a064752236|journal=[[Contemporary Review|The Contemporary Review]]|publisher=The Contemporary Review Company Limited|volume=277|issue=1615|page=108|issn=0010-7565|via=The Free Library}}</ref>\n\nThe concept of the hero has invited comparisons between ''Watership Down's'' characters and those in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' and [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]''.<ref name=\"masterplots\" /> Hazel's courage, Bigwig's strength, Blackberry's ingenuity and craftiness, and Dandelion's and Bluebell's poetry and storytelling all have parallels in the [[epic poetry|epic poem]] ''Odyssey''.<ref name=\"rothen\">{{cite journal | last = Rothen | first = Kathleen J. |author2=Beverly Langston | title = Hazel, Fiver, Odysseus, and You: An Odyssey into Critical Thinking | journal = The English Journal | volume = 76 | issue = 3 | pages = 56\u201359 | publisher = [[National Council of Teachers of English]] |date=March 1987 | issn = 1544-6166}}</ref> Kenneth Kitchell declared, \"Hazel stands in the tradition of [[Odysseus]], [[Aeneas]], and others\".<ref name=\"kitchell\">{{cite journal | last = Kitchell, Jr. | first = Kenneth F. | title = The Shrinking of the Epic Hero: From Homer to Richard Adams's Watership Down | journal = Classical and Modern Literature: A Quarterly | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 13\u201330 | date = Fall 1986 | issn = 0197-2227}}</ref> [[J.

The acquisition of the inn constituted a considerable financial burden.<ref name=p42 group=Huerta/> When Reijnier died in October 1652, Vermeer took over the operation of the family's art business.\n\n===Marriage and family===\n\nIn April 1653, Johannes Reijniersz Vermeer married a [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] woman, Catharina Bolenes (Bolnes). The blessing took place in the quiet nearby village of [[Schipluiden]]. Vermeer's new mother-in-law [[Maria Thins]] was significantly wealthier than he, and it was probably she who insisted that Vermeer convert to Catholicism before the marriage on 5 April.<ref group=\"Note\">Catholicism was not a forbidden religion, but tolerated in the [[Dutch Republic]]. They were not allowed to build new churches, so services were held in hidden churches (so-called [[Schuilkerk]]). Catholics were restrained in their careers, unable to get high-rank  jobs in city administration or civic guard. It was impossible to be elected as a member of the city council; therefore, the Catholics were not represented in the provincial and national assembly.</ref> According to art historian [[Walter Liedtke]], Vermeer's conversion seems to have been made with conviction.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Liedtke|first1=Walter|last2=Plomp|first2=Michiel C.|last3=R\u00fcger|first3=Axel|authorlink1=Walter Liedtke|title=Vermeer and the Delft school: [catalogue ... in conjunction with the exhibition \"Vermeer and the Delft School\" held at The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, from 8 March to 27 May 2001, and at The National Gallery, London, from 20 June to 16 September 2001]|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_EZxWaNlQKiYC|date=2001|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=0870999737|pages=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_EZxWaNlQKiYC/page/n373 359]}}</ref> His painting ''[[The Allegory of Faith]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/32.100.18 |title=Johannes Vermeer: Allegory of the Catholic Faith (32.100.18) &#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History &#124; The Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=Metmuseum.org |date=20 July 2012 |accessdate=24 July 2012}}</ref> made between 1670 and 1672, placed less emphasis on the artists' usual naturalistic concerns and more on symbolic religious applications, including the sacrament of the [[Eucharist]].

There is some speculation that [[Carel Fabritius]] may have been his teacher, based upon a controversial interpretation of a text written in 1668 by printer Arnold Bon. Art historians have found no hard evidence to support this.<ref name=p104 group=Montias/> Local authority [[Leonaert Bramer]] acted as a friend, but their style of painting is rather different.<ref name=Gallery/> Liedtke suggests that Vermeer taught himself, using information from one of his father's connections.<ref name=p866 group=Liedtke/> Some scholars think that Vermeer was trained under Catholic painter [[Abraham Bloemaert]]. Vermeer's style is similar to that of some of the [[Utrecht Caravaggists]], whose works are depicted as paintings-within-paintings in the backgrounds of several of his compositions.<ref group=\"Note\">Identifiable works include compositions by Utrecht painters [[Dirck van Baburen|Baburen]] and [[Caesar van Everdingen|Everdingen]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Delftsedonderslag.jpg|thumb|left|''A View of Delft after the Explosion of 1654'', by [[Egbert van der Poel]]]]\nOn 29 December 1653, Vermeer became a member of the [[Guild of Saint Luke#Dutch Republic|Guild of Saint Luke]], a trade association for painters. The guild's records make clear that Vermeer did not pay the usual admission fee. It was a year of [[Bubonic plague|plague]], [[First Anglo-Dutch War|war]], and economic crisis; Vermeer was not alone in experiencing difficult financial circumstances. In 1654, the city suffered the terrible explosion known as the [[Delft Explosion|Delft Thunderclap]], which destroyed a large section of the city.<ref>[http://www.essentialvermeer.com/maps/delft/delft_in_vermeer's_time.html \"Delft in Johannes Vermeer's Time\"], Essential Vermeer. Retrieved 29 September 2009</ref> In 1657, he might have found a patron in local art collector [[Pieter van Ruijven]], who lent him some money. It seems that Vermeer turned for inspiration to the art of the [[fijnschilder]]s from Leiden. Vermeer was responding to the market of [[Gerard Dou]]'s paintings, who sold his paintings for exorbitant prices. Dou may have influenced [[Pieter de Hooch]] and [[Gabriel Metsu]], too. Vermeer also charged higher than average prices for his work, most of which were purchased by an unknown collector.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The age of Rembrandt and Vermeer: Dutch painting in the seventeenth century|last=Nash|first=J.M.|publisher=Holt, Rinehart, and Winston|year=1972|isbn=9780030918704|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/ageofrembrandt00nash/page/40 40]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/ageofrembrandt00nash/page/40}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Vermeer-view-of-delft.jpg|thumb|''[[View of Delft]]'' (1660\u201361): \"He took a turbulent reality, and made it look like Heaven on earth.\"<ref>[[Andrew Graham-Dixon]], ''The Madness of Vermeer'', BBC Four.</ref>]]\n\nThe influence of Johannes Vermeer on Metsu is unmistakable: the light from the left, the marble floor.<ref>Adriaan E.

Waiboer, however, suggests that Metsu requires more emotional involvement of the viewer.) Vermeer probably competed also with [[Nicolaes Maes]], who produced [[genre works]] in a similar style. In 1662, Vermeer was elected head of the guild and was reelected in 1663, 1670, and 1671, evidence that he (like Bramer) was considered an established craftsman among his peers. Vermeer worked slowly, probably producing three paintings a year on order. [[Balthasar de Monconys]] visited him in 1663 to see some of his work, but Vermeer had no paintings to show. The diplomat and the two French clergymen who accompanied him were sent to [[Hendrick van Buyten]], a baker who had a couple of his paintings as collateral.\n\nIn 1671, [[Gerrit van Uylenburgh]] organised the auction of [[Gerrit Reynst]]'s collection and offered 13 paintings and some sculptures to [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg]].

Many people panicked; courts, theaters, shops and schools were closed. Five years passed before circumstances improved. In 1674, Vermeer was listed as a member of the [[schutterij|civic guards]].<ref>[http://www.essentialvermeer.com/delft/delft_today/schutterij.html#.VC-ZUBY09EI \"Vermeer's Delft Today: Schutterij and the Doelen\"], Essential Vermeer.</ref> In the summer of 1675, Vermeer borrowed 1,000 guilders in Amsterdam from [[Hendrick Sorgh|Jacob Romboutsz]], an Amsterdam silk trader, using his mother-in-law's property as a [[surety]].<ref>{{cite book|author=John Michael Montias|title=Vermeer and His Milieu: A Web of Social History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ev1xavyduGYC&pg=PA337|year=1991|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-00289-4|page=337}}</ref><ref>[https://cmkschilderwerken.nl/vermeer-en-milieu/ \"A Postscript on Vermeer and His Milieu\"], Auteur: John Michael Montias, Uitgever: Uitgeverij Atlas Contact B.V.</ref>\n\nIn December 1675, Vermeer died after a short illness.

These paintings were sold in Amsterdam the following year in a much-studied auction, published by [[Gerard Hoet]].</ref> Several factors contributed to his limited body of work. Vermeer never had any pupils, though one scholar has suggested that Vermeer taught his eldest daughter Maria to paint.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Binstock, Benjamin.|title=Vermeer's family secrets : genius, discovery, and the unknown apprentice|date=2009|publisher=Routledge|others=Vermeer, Johannes, 1632-1675.|isbn=978-0-415-96664-1|location=New York|oclc=191024081}}</ref> Additionally, his family obligations with so many children may have taken up much of his time, as would acting as both an art-dealer and inn-keeper in running the family businesses. His time spent serving as head of the guild and his extraordinary precision as a painter may have also limited his output.\n\n==Style==\nVermeer may have first executed his paintings tonally like most painters of his time, using either monochrome shades of grey (\"[[grisaille]]\") or a limited palette of browns and greys (\"dead coloring\"), over which he would apply more saturated colors (reds, yellows and blues) in the form of transparent glazes. No drawings have been positively attributed to Vermeer, and his paintings offer few clues to preparatory methods.\n\nThere is no other 17th-century artist who employed the exorbitantly expensive pigment [[lapis lazuli]] (natural [[ultramarine]]) either so lavishly or so early in his career. Vermeer used this in not just elements that are naturally of this colour; the earth colours [[umber]] and [[ochre]] should be understood as warm light within a painting's strongly lit interior, which reflects its multiple colours onto the wall. In this way, he created a world more perfect than any he had witnessed.<ref name=p867 group=Liedtke/> This working method most probably was inspired by Vermeer's understanding of [[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo's]] observations that the surface of every object partakes of the colour of the adjacent object.<ref name=wadum95/> This means that no object is ever seen entirely in its natural colour.\n\nA comparable but even more remarkable, yet effectual, use of natural ultramarine is in ''The Girl with the Wine Glass''. The shadows of the red satin dress are [[underpainting|underpainted]] in natural ultramarine,<ref>Gaskell, I., M. Jonker & National Gallery of Art (US) (1998), ''Vermeer Studies''. Washington: National Gallery of Art, p. 157. {{ISBN|0300075219}}</ref> and, owing to this underlying blue paint layer, the red lake and [[vermilion]] mixture applied over it acquires a slightly purple, cool and crisp appearance that is most powerful.\n\nEven after Vermeer's supposed financial breakdown following the so-called [[rampjaar]] (year of disaster) in 1672, he continued to employ natural ultramarine generously, such as in ''Lady Seated at a Virginal''. This could suggest that Vermeer was supplied with materials by a collector, and would coincide with [[John Michael Montias]]\u2019 theory that [[Pieter van Ruijven]] was Vermeer's patron.\n\nVermeer's works are largely [[Genre works|genre pieces]] and portraits, with the exception of two cityscapes and two [[allegory|allegories]]. His subjects offer a cross-section of seventeenth-century Dutch society, ranging from the portrayal of a simple milkmaid at work, to the luxury and splendour of rich notables and merchantmen in their roomy houses. Besides these subjects, religious, poetical, musical, and scientific comments can also be found in his work.\n\n===Painting materials===\nOne aspect of his meticulous painting technique was Vermeer's choice of pigments.<ref>Kuhn, H. \"A Study of the Pigments and Grounds Used by Jan Vermeer\". ''Reports and Studies in the History of Art'', 1968, 154\u2013202</ref> He is best known for his frequent use of the very expensive [[ultramarine]] (''[[The Milkmaid (Vermeer)|The Milkmaid]]''), and also [[lead-tin-yellow]] (''[[A Lady Writing a Letter]]''), [[madder lake]] ([[Christ in the House of Martha and Mary (Vermeer)|''Christ in the House of Martha and Mary'']]), and [[vermilion]]. He also painted with [[ochres]], [[bone black]] and [[azurite]].<ref>Illustrated pigment analyses of Vermeer's paintings: [http://colourlex.com/paintings/paintings-painter/dutch-painters/ Dutch Painters], Colourlex</ref> The claim that he utilized Indian yellow in ''[[Woman Holding a Balance]]''<ref>Kuhn, 1968, pp. 191\u2013192</ref> has been disproven by later pigment analysis.<ref>Gifford, E.M., \"Painting Light: Recent Observations on Vermeer\u2019s Technique\", in Gaskell, I. and Jonker, M., ed., ''Vermeer Studies, in Studies in the History of Art'', 55, National Gallery of Art, Washington 1998, pp. 185\u2013199</ref>\n\nIn Vermeer's oeuvre, only about 20 pigments have been detected. Of these 20 pigments, seven principal pigments which Vermeer commonly employed include lead white, yellow ochre, vermilion, madder lake, green earth, raw umber, and ivory or bone black.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Janson|first1=Jonathan|title=Vermeer's Palette|url=http://www.essentialvermeer.com/palette/palette_vermeer'_palette.html#.WM7coBIrJE5|website=Essential Vermeer|accessdate=19 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Camera obscura===\n\nVermeer's painting techniques have long been a source of debate, given their almost [[photorealistic]] attention to detail, despite Vermeer's having had no formal training, and despite only limited evidence that Vermeer had created any preparatory sketches or traces for his paintings.{{CN|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn 2001, British artist [[David Hockney]] published the book ''Secret Knowledge: Rediscovering the Lost Techniques of the Old Masters'', in which he argued that Vermeer (among other Renaissance and Baroque artists including [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Hans Holbein]] and [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]]) used optics to achieve precise positioning in their compositions, and specifically some combination of [[curved mirror]]s, [[camera obscura]], and [[camera lucida]]. This became known as the [[Hockney\u2013Falco thesis]], named after Hockney and [[Charles M. Falco]], another proponent of the theory.\n\nProfessor Philip Steadman published the book ''Vermeer's Camera: Uncovering the Truth behind the Masterpieces'' in 2001 which specifically claimed that Vermeer had used a camera obscura to create his paintings. Steadman noted that many of Vermeer's paintings had been painted in the same room, and he found six of his paintings that are precisely the right size if they had been painted from inside a camera obscura in the room's back wall.<ref name=BBC_Steadman/>\n\nSupporters of these theories have pointed to evidence in some of Vermeer's paintings, such as the often-discussed sparkling pearly highlights in Vermeer's paintings, which they argue are the result of the primitive lens of a camera obscura producing [[halo (optical phenomenon)|halation]]. It was also postulated that a camera obscura was the mechanical cause of the \"exaggerated\" perspective seen in ''[[The Music Lesson]]'' (London, [[Royal Collection]]).{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn 2008, American entrepreneur and inventor [[Tim Jenison]] developed the theory that Vermeer had used a camera obscura along with a \"comparator mirror\", which is similar in concept to a [[camera lucida]] but much simpler and makes it easy to match color values. He later modified the theory to simply involve a concave mirror and a comparator mirror. He spent the next five years testing his theory by attempting to re-create ''The Music Lesson'' himself using these tools, a process captured in the 2013 documentary film ''[[Tim's Vermeer]]''.<ref name=Vanity/>\n\nSeveral points were brought out by Jenison in support of this technique: first was Vermeer's hyper-accurate rendition of light falloff along the wall. Neurobiologist [[Colin Blakemore]], in an interview with Jenison, notes that human vision cannot process information about the absolute brightness of a scene.<ref name=Tims/> Another was the addition of several highlights and outlines consistent with matching the effects of [[chromatic aberration]], particularly noticeable in primitive optics. Last, and perhaps most telling, is a noticeable curvature in the original painting's rendition of the scrollwork on the harpsichord. This effect matched Jenison's technique precisely, caused by exactly duplicating the view as seen from a curved mirror.\n\nThis theory remains disputed. There is no historical evidence regarding Vermeer's interest in optics, aside from the accurately observed mirror reflection above the lady at the virginals in ''[[The Music Lesson]]''.

The same subject was also painted by Vermeer. Almost all of Vermeer's paintings are of contemporary subjects in a smaller format, with a cooler palette dominated by blues, yellows, and grays. Practically all of his surviving works belong to this period, usually domestic interiors with one or two figures lit by a window on the left. They are characterized by a sense of compositional balance and spatial order, unified by a pearly light. Mundane domestic or recreational activities are imbued with a poetic timelessness (e.g., ''[[Girl Reading a Letter at an Open Window]]'', Dresden, Gem\u00e4ldegalerie). Vermeer's two [[townscape]]s have also been attributed to this period: ''[[View of Delft]]'' (The Hague, Mauritshuis) and ''[[The Little Street (Vermeer)|''A street in Delft'']]'' (Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum).\n\nA few of his paintings show a certain hardening of manner and are generally thought to represent his late works. From this period come ''[[The Allegory of Faith]]'' (c. 1670; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York) and ''[[The Love Letter (Vermeer)|The Love Letter]]'' (c. 1670; Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam).\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Th\u00e9ophile_Thor\u00e9_by_Nadar.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Th\u00e9ophile Thor\u00e9-B\u00fcrger]]]]\nOriginally, Vermeer's works were largely overlooked by art historians for two centuries after his death. A select number of connoisseurs in the Netherlands did appreciate his work, yet even so, many of his works were attributed to better-known artists such as [[Gabriel Metsu|Metsu]] or [[Frans van Mieris the Elder|Mieris]]. The Delft master's modern rediscovery began about 1860, when German museum director [[Gustav Waagen]] saw ''[[The Art of Painting]]'' in the Czernin gallery in Vienna and recognized the work as a Vermeer, though it was attributed to [[Pieter de Hooch]] at that time.<ref>Gaskell, Jonker & National Gallery of Art (1998).

Dali also immortalized the [[Dutch Masters|Dutch Master]] in ''[[The Ghost of Vermeer of Delft Which Can Be Used As a Table]]'', 1934.\n\n[[Han van Meegeren]] was a 20th-century Dutch painter who worked in the classical tradition.

The guild's records make clear that Vermeer did not pay the usual admission fee. It was a year of [[Bubonic plague|plague]], [[First Anglo-Dutch War|war]], and economic crisis; Vermeer was not alone in experiencing difficult financial circumstances. In 1654, the city suffered the terrible explosion known as the [[Delft Explosion|Delft Thunderclap]], which destroyed a large section of the city.<ref>[http://www.essentialvermeer.com/maps/delft/delft_in_vermeer's_time.html \"Delft in Johannes Vermeer's Time\"], Essential Vermeer.

It seems that Vermeer turned for inspiration to the art of the [[fijnschilder]]s from Leiden. Vermeer was responding to the market of [[Gerard Dou]]'s paintings, who sold his paintings for exorbitant prices. Dou may have influenced [[Pieter de Hooch]] and [[Gabriel Metsu]], too. Vermeer also charged higher than average prices for his work, most of which were purchased by an unknown collector.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The age of Rembrandt and Vermeer: Dutch painting in the seventeenth century|last=Nash|first=J.M.|publisher=Holt, Rinehart, and Winston|year=1972|isbn=9780030918704|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/ageofrembrandt00nash/page/40 40]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/ageofrembrandt00nash/page/40}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Vermeer-view-of-delft.jpg|thumb|''[[View of Delft]]'' (1660\u201361): \"He took a turbulent reality, and made it look like Heaven on earth.\"<ref>[[Andrew Graham-Dixon]], ''The Madness of Vermeer'', BBC Four.</ref>]]\n\nThe influence of Johannes Vermeer on Metsu is unmistakable: the light from the left, the marble floor.<ref>Adriaan E.

Waiboer, however, suggests that Metsu requires more emotional involvement of the viewer.) Vermeer probably competed also with [[Nicolaes Maes]], who produced [[genre works]] in a similar style. In 1662, Vermeer was elected head of the guild and was reelected in 1663, 1670, and 1671, evidence that he (like Bramer) was considered an established craftsman among his peers. Vermeer worked slowly, probably producing three paintings a year on order. [[Balthasar de Monconys]] visited him in 1663 to see some of his work, but Vermeer had no paintings to show. The diplomat and the two French clergymen who accompanied him were sent to [[Hendrick van Buyten]], a baker who had a couple of his paintings as collateral.\n\nIn 1671, [[Gerrit van Uylenburgh]] organised the auction of [[Gerrit Reynst]]'s collection and offered 13 paintings and some sculptures to [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg]].

Many people panicked; courts, theaters, shops and schools were closed. Five years passed before circumstances improved. In 1674, Vermeer was listed as a member of the [[schutterij|civic guards]].<ref>[http://www.essentialvermeer.com/delft/delft_today/schutterij.html#.VC-ZUBY09EI \"Vermeer's Delft Today: Schutterij and the Doelen\"], Essential Vermeer.</ref> In the summer of 1675, Vermeer borrowed 1,000 guilders in Amsterdam from [[Hendrick Sorgh|Jacob Romboutsz]], an Amsterdam silk trader, using his mother-in-law's property as a [[surety]].<ref>{{cite book|author=John Michael Montias|title=Vermeer and His Milieu: A Web of Social History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ev1xavyduGYC&pg=PA337|year=1991|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-00289-4|page=337}}</ref><ref>[https://cmkschilderwerken.nl/vermeer-en-milieu/ \"A Postscript on Vermeer and His Milieu\"], Auteur: John Michael Montias, Uitgever: Uitgeverij Atlas Contact B.V.</ref>\n\nIn December 1675, Vermeer died after a short illness.

These paintings were sold in Amsterdam the following year in a much-studied auction, published by [[Gerard Hoet]].</ref> Several factors contributed to his limited body of work. Vermeer never had any pupils, though one scholar has suggested that Vermeer taught his eldest daughter Maria to paint.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Binstock, Benjamin.|title=Vermeer's family secrets : genius, discovery, and the unknown apprentice|date=2009|publisher=Routledge|others=Vermeer, Johannes, 1632-1675.|isbn=978-0-415-96664-1|location=New York|oclc=191024081}}</ref> Additionally, his family obligations with so many children may have taken up much of his time, as would acting as both an art-dealer and inn-keeper in running the family businesses. His time spent serving as head of the guild and his extraordinary precision as a painter may have also limited his output.\n\n==Style==\nVermeer may have first executed his paintings tonally like most painters of his time, using either monochrome shades of grey (\"[[grisaille]]\") or a limited palette of browns and greys (\"dead coloring\"), over which he would apply more saturated colors (reds, yellows and blues) in the form of transparent glazes. No drawings have been positively attributed to Vermeer, and his paintings offer few clues to preparatory methods.\n\nThere is no other 17th-century artist who employed the exorbitantly expensive pigment [[lapis lazuli]] (natural [[ultramarine]]) either so lavishly or so early in his career. Vermeer used this in not just elements that are naturally of this colour; the earth colours [[umber]] and [[ochre]] should be understood as warm light within a painting's strongly lit interior, which reflects its multiple colours onto the wall. In this way, he created a world more perfect than any he had witnessed.<ref name=p867 group=Liedtke/> This working method most probably was inspired by Vermeer's understanding of [[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo's]] observations that the surface of every object partakes of the colour of the adjacent object.<ref name=wadum95/> This means that no object is ever seen entirely in its natural colour.\n\nA comparable but even more remarkable, yet effectual, use of natural ultramarine is in ''The Girl with the Wine Glass''. The shadows of the red satin dress are [[underpainting|underpainted]] in natural ultramarine,<ref>Gaskell, I., M. Jonker & National Gallery of Art (US) (1998), ''Vermeer Studies''. Washington: National Gallery of Art, p. 157. {{ISBN|0300075219}}</ref> and, owing to this underlying blue paint layer, the red lake and [[vermilion]] mixture applied over it acquires a slightly purple, cool and crisp appearance that is most powerful.\n\nEven after Vermeer's supposed financial breakdown following the so-called [[rampjaar]] (year of disaster) in 1672, he continued to employ natural ultramarine generously, such as in ''Lady Seated at a Virginal''. This could suggest that Vermeer was supplied with materials by a collector, and would coincide with [[John Michael Montias]]\u2019 theory that [[Pieter van Ruijven]] was Vermeer's patron.\n\nVermeer's works are largely [[Genre works|genre pieces]] and portraits, with the exception of two cityscapes and two [[allegory|allegories]]. His subjects offer a cross-section of seventeenth-century Dutch society, ranging from the portrayal of a simple milkmaid at work, to the luxury and splendour of rich notables and merchantmen in their roomy houses. Besides these subjects, religious, poetical, musical, and scientific comments can also be found in his work.\n\n===Painting materials===\nOne aspect of his meticulous painting technique was Vermeer's choice of pigments.<ref>Kuhn, H. \"A Study of the Pigments and Grounds Used by Jan Vermeer\". ''Reports and Studies in the History of Art'', 1968, 154\u2013202</ref> He is best known for his frequent use of the very expensive [[ultramarine]] (''[[The Milkmaid (Vermeer)|The Milkmaid]]''), and also [[lead-tin-yellow]] (''[[A Lady Writing a Letter]]''), [[madder lake]] ([[Christ in the House of Martha and Mary (Vermeer)|''Christ in the House of Martha and Mary'']]), and [[vermilion]]. He also painted with [[ochres]], [[bone black]] and [[azurite]].<ref>Illustrated pigment analyses of Vermeer's paintings: [http://colourlex.com/paintings/paintings-painter/dutch-painters/ Dutch Painters], Colourlex</ref> The claim that he utilized Indian yellow in ''[[Woman Holding a Balance]]''<ref>Kuhn, 1968, pp. 191\u2013192</ref> has been disproven by later pigment analysis.<ref>Gifford, E.M., \"Painting Light: Recent Observations on Vermeer\u2019s Technique\", in Gaskell, I. and Jonker, M., ed., ''Vermeer Studies, in Studies in the History of Art'', 55, National Gallery of Art, Washington 1998, pp. 185\u2013199</ref>\n\nIn Vermeer's oeuvre, only about 20 pigments have been detected. Of these 20 pigments, seven principal pigments which Vermeer commonly employed include lead white, yellow ochre, vermilion, madder lake, green earth, raw umber, and ivory or bone black.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Janson|first1=Jonathan|title=Vermeer's Palette|url=http://www.essentialvermeer.com/palette/palette_vermeer'_palette.html#.WM7coBIrJE5|website=Essential Vermeer|accessdate=19 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Camera obscura===\n\nVermeer's painting techniques have long been a source of debate, given their almost [[photorealistic]] attention to detail, despite Vermeer's having had no formal training, and despite only limited evidence that Vermeer had created any preparatory sketches or traces for his paintings.{{CN|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn 2001, British artist [[David Hockney]] published the book ''Secret Knowledge: Rediscovering the Lost Techniques of the Old Masters'', in which he argued that Vermeer (among other Renaissance and Baroque artists including [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Hans Holbein]] and [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]]) used optics to achieve precise positioning in their compositions, and specifically some combination of [[curved mirror]]s, [[camera obscura]], and [[camera lucida]]. This became known as the [[Hockney\u2013Falco thesis]], named after Hockney and [[Charles M. Falco]], another proponent of the theory.\n\nProfessor Philip Steadman published the book ''Vermeer's Camera: Uncovering the Truth behind the Masterpieces'' in 2001 which specifically claimed that Vermeer had used a camera obscura to create his paintings. Steadman noted that many of Vermeer's paintings had been painted in the same room, and he found six of his paintings that are precisely the right size if they had been painted from inside a camera obscura in the room's back wall.<ref name=BBC_Steadman/>\n\nSupporters of these theories have pointed to evidence in some of Vermeer's paintings, such as the often-discussed sparkling pearly highlights in Vermeer's paintings, which they argue are the result of the primitive lens of a camera obscura producing [[halo (optical phenomenon)|halation]]. It was also postulated that a camera obscura was the mechanical cause of the \"exaggerated\" perspective seen in ''[[The Music Lesson]]'' (London, [[Royal Collection]]).{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn 2008, American entrepreneur and inventor [[Tim Jenison]] developed the theory that Vermeer had used a camera obscura along with a \"comparator mirror\", which is similar in concept to a [[camera lucida]] but much simpler and makes it easy to match color values. He later modified the theory to simply involve a concave mirror and a comparator mirror. He spent the next five years testing his theory by attempting to re-create ''The Music Lesson'' himself using these tools, a process captured in the 2013 documentary film ''[[Tim's Vermeer]]''.<ref name=Vanity/>\n\nSeveral points were brought out by Jenison in support of this technique: first was Vermeer's hyper-accurate rendition of light falloff along the wall. Neurobiologist [[Colin Blakemore]], in an interview with Jenison, notes that human vision cannot process information about the absolute brightness of a scene.<ref name=Tims/> Another was the addition of several highlights and outlines consistent with matching the effects of [[chromatic aberration]], particularly noticeable in primitive optics. Last, and perhaps most telling, is a noticeable curvature in the original painting's rendition of the scrollwork on the harpsichord. This effect matched Jenison's technique precisely, caused by exactly duplicating the view as seen from a curved mirror.\n\nThis theory remains disputed. There is no historical evidence regarding Vermeer's interest in optics, aside from the accurately observed mirror reflection above the lady at the virginals in ''[[The Music Lesson]]''. The detailed inventory of the artist's belongings drawn up after his death does not include a camera obscura or any similar device.<ref name=Obscura/> However, Vermeer was in close connection with pioneer lens maker [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] and Leeuwenhoek was his executor after death.<ref name=bryson/>\n\n==Works==\n{{See also|List of paintings by Johannes Vermeer|Category:Johannes Vermeer }}\nVermeer produced a total of fewer than 50 paintings, of which 34 have survived.<ref name=\"veconomist\">{{cite news|title=Vermeer was brilliant, but he was not without influences|url=https://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21730134-blockbuster-show-punctures-myth-solitary-genius-vermeer-was-brilliant-he|work=[[The Economist]]|date=12 October 2017}}</ref> Only three Vermeer paintings were dated by the artist: ''[[The Procuress (Vermeer)|The Procuress]]'' (1656; Gem\u00e4ldegalerie, Dresden); ''[[The Astronomer (painting)|The Astronomer]]'' (1668; Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Paris); and ''[[The Geographer]]'' (1669; St\u00e4delsches Kunstinstitut, Frankfurt).\n\nVermeer's mother-in-law Maria Thins owned [[Dirck van Baburen]]'s 1622 oil-on-canvas ''[[The Procuress (Dirck van Baburen)|The Procuress]]'' (or a copy of it), which appears in the background of two of Vermeer's paintings. The same subject was also painted by Vermeer. Almost all of Vermeer's paintings are of contemporary subjects in a smaller format, with a cooler palette dominated by blues, yellows, and grays. Practically all of his surviving works belong to this period, usually domestic interiors with one or two figures lit by a window on the left. They are characterized by a sense of compositional balance and spatial order, unified by a pearly light. Mundane domestic or recreational activities are imbued with a poetic timelessness (e.g., ''[[Girl Reading a Letter at an Open Window]]'', Dresden, Gem\u00e4ldegalerie). Vermeer's two [[townscape]]s have also been attributed to this period: ''[[View of Delft]]'' (The Hague, Mauritshuis) and ''[[The Little Street (Vermeer)|''A street in Delft'']]'' (Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum).\n\nA few of his paintings show a certain hardening of manner and are generally thought to represent his late works. From this period come ''[[The Allegory of Faith]]'' (c. 1670; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York) and ''[[The Love Letter (Vermeer)|The Love Letter]]'' (c. 1670; Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam).\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Th\u00e9ophile_Thor\u00e9_by_Nadar.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Th\u00e9ophile Thor\u00e9-B\u00fcrger]]]]\nOriginally, Vermeer's works were largely overlooked by art historians for two centuries after his death. A select number of connoisseurs in the Netherlands did appreciate his work, yet even so, many of his works were attributed to better-known artists such as [[Gabriel Metsu|Metsu]] or [[Frans van Mieris the Elder|Mieris]]. The Delft master's modern rediscovery began about 1860, when German museum director [[Gustav Waagen]] saw ''[[The Art of Painting]]'' in the Czernin gallery in Vienna and recognized the work as a Vermeer, though it was attributed to [[Pieter de Hooch]] at that time.<ref>Gaskell, Jonker & National Gallery of Art (1998). ''Vermeer Studies'', pp. 19\u201320.</ref> Research by [[Th\u00e9ophile Thor\u00e9-B\u00fcrger]] culminated in the publication of his [[catalogue raisonn\u00e9]] of Vermeer's works in the ''[[Gazette des Beaux-Arts]]'' in 1866.<ref name=\"VermeerStudies42\">Gaskell, Jonker & National Gallery of Art (1998).

Other artists who were inspired by Vermeer include Danish painter [[Wilhelm Hammershoi]]<ref>Gunnarsson, Torsten (1998), ''Nordic Landscape Painting in the Nineteenth Century''. Yale University Press, p. 227. {{ISBN|0300070411}}</ref> and American [[Thomas Wilmer Dewing]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artic.edu/aic/resources/resource/473 |title=Interpretive Resource: Artist Biography: Thomas Wilmer Dewing |publisher=Artic.edu |accessdate=10 April 2014}}</ref> In the 20th century, Vermeer's admirers included [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]], who painted his own version of ''The Lacemaker'' (on commission from collector [[Robert Lehman]]) and pitted large copies of the original against a rhinoceros in some surrealist experiments. Dali also immortalized the [[Dutch Masters|Dutch Master]] in ''[[The Ghost of Vermeer of Delft Which Can Be Used As a Table]]'', 1934.\n\n[[Han van Meegeren]] was a 20th-century Dutch painter who worked in the classical tradition. He became a master forger, motivated by a blend of aesthetic and financial reasons, creating and selling many new \"Vermeers\" before turning himself in for forgery to avoid being charged with capital treason for collaboration with the Nazis, specifically, in selling what had been believed to be original artwork to the Nazis.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/22/books/review/Julius-t.html?_r=2 |title=The Lying Dutchman |author=Anthony Julius|newspaper=The New York Times |date=22 June 2008 |accessdate=19 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn the evening of 23 September 1971, a 21-year-old hotel waiter, Mario Pierre Roymans, stole Vermeer's ''Love Letter'' from the Fine Arts Palace in Brussels where it was on loan from the Rijksmuseum as a part of the Rembrandt and his Age exhibition.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.essentialvermeer.com/fakes_thefts_school_of_delft_lost_sp/vermeer_theft_01.html#.VrvQ8fk4HIU|title=Vermeer Thefts: The Love Letter|last=Janson|first=Jonathan|website=www.essentialvermeer.com|access-date=10 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{See also|Johannes Vermeer in popular culture}}\n\nVermeer's reputation and works have been featured in both literature and in films such as ''Girl with a Pearl Earring''.
