His most significant work from that period is album ''Les cinq saisons \u2013 Automne'', published in 1990 by [[Dargaud]]. That album was appointed by the [[Ministry of Culture (France)|Ministry of Culture in France]] as a work of significant cultural value and was assigned to all public libraries in France (in 2011 the same album was featured in [[Paul Gravett]]\u2019s book ''[[1001 Comics You Must Read Before You Die]]''<ref>https://www.listchallenges.com/1001-comics-you-must-read-before-you-die/list/8</ref>.\nKordej moves from Zagreb to a small Istrian village, [[Groznjan]] in 1988 where he leads, as an artist and supervisor, a group of over 20 artists and story writers (among others a young [[Darko Macan]], [[Edvin Biukovi\u0107]] and [[Goran Sud\u017euka]]), as well as veterans Radovan Devli\u0107<ref>https://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radovan_Devli%C4%87 (in Croatian)</ref> and Dragan Filipovi\u0107 Fipa<ref>https://uzicanstveno.rs/uzicanstveno/upoznajmo-fipu-fantastiku-da-bi-ga-vise-voleli/ (in Serbian)</ref>, producing comics and design for the German market.\n====Moving abroad====\nHe moves to [[Denmark]] in 1991, invited by Semic International company, where he spends almost a year, producing comics and illustrations for [[Malibu Comics]].\nIn 1997 he moves to [[Canada]], invited by [[Digital Chameleon]] company, working as a creative director. Having disputes with management, he leaves the company after eight months and becames a [[freelancer]] again.\n\n====Marvel====\nHis career in [[Marvel Comics]] can be divided in two phases; the first one (when he simultaneously worked for [[Dark Horse Comics]]) is from 1994-1996, under editor-in-chief [[Marcus McLaurin]], when Kordej produced several hand-painted comics for ''Tales of Marvels'' series. Second phase begins in 2001 when he got invited by editor-in\u2013chief [[Joe Quesada]], to work on [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] series, as well as [[New X-Men]] series. Shortly after [[9/11 attacks]] many of Marvel artists produced illustrations inspired by the tragedy. They all went on public auction, with all profit given to families of fallen rescuers. Kordey\u2019s illustration ''Pennsylvania Plane''<ref>https://www.loc.gov/item/2002718202/</ref> was bought by [[The Library of Congress]]. Because of his speed as an artist, at his peak, Kordej was producing artwork for three or four monthly books at the same time.

On February 23, 1929, [[Maddux Air Lines]] began the airport's first scheduled passenger service with a route between San Francisco and El Paso stopping in Phoenix, Los Angeles, and several other cities however the service was short lived, ending by autumn 1929. [[Standard Air Lines]] had been serving Phoenix since late 1927 through a different airport and began landing at Sky Harbor on August 5, 1929. Standard operated a route between Los Angeles and El Paso stopping at Phoenix, Tucson, and Douglas, Arizona. Standard was acquired by American Airways in 1930 which later became [[American Airlines]]. American extended the route eastward to New York by way of Dallas, Nashville, and many other cities making for a southern transcontinental route across the United States. In 1935 the city of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] purchased Sky Harbor airport from Acme for $100,000.\n \n[[Trans World Airlines|TWA]] began service to [[San Francisco]] in 1938 and added Phoenix onto its transcontinental network by 1944 with flights to Los Angeles and eastward to New York stopping at Albuquerque, Kansas City, and many more cities. \n[[Arizona Airways]] began intrastate service within Arizona in 1946 and merged into [[Frontier Airlines (1950-1986)|Frontier Airlines]] in 1950 which added new routes to Denver, Albuquerque, and El Paso. \n[[Bonanza Airlines]] began service by 1951 with a route to Las Vegas and Reno making several stops at smaller communities. New routes to Salt Lake City and southern California were added in the 1960's along with nonstop flights to Las Vegas and Reno aboard [[Douglas DC-9]] jets in 1965. Bonanza merged with two other carriers to become [[Air West]] in 1968 and was changed to [[Hughes Airwest]] in 1970 adding several new routes, including service to Mexico, creating a hub at Phoenix. Hughes Airwest was then merged into [[Republic Airlines (1979-1986)|Republic Airlines]] in 1980 which continued the Phoenix hub operation until the mid 1980's. \n[[Western Airlines]] came to Sky Harbor in 1957 with flights to Denver, Los Angeles and San Diego, [[Continental Airlines]] came in 1961 to El Paso, Los Angeles, and Tucson, and [[Delta Air Lines]] began flights to Dallas by 1969. <ref>{{cite web |title=1935 and The Farm \u2013 Sky Harbor's Early Years and Memories |url=http://skyharbor.com/about/earlyYears.html |website=Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport |date=August 30, 2010 |access-date=July 12, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140627205926/http://skyharbor.com/about/earlyYears.html |archive-date=June 27, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> Since airline deregulation in 1978, Phoenix has seen numerous new air carriers begin service including [[United Airlines]] in 1980 and [[Southwest Airlines]] in 1982.\n\nAfter [[World War II]] the airport began work on a new passenger terminal, as well as a new parallel runway and a diagonal runway.<ref name=\"tempe\">{{cite web |title=Phoenix Sky Harbor \u2013 City of Tempe History |url=http://www.tempe.gov/aircraftnoise/History.htm |work=[[Tempe, Arizona|City of Tempe]] |access-date=July 12, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100914155141/http://www.tempe.gov/aircraftnoise/History.htm |archivedate=September 14, 2010}}</ref> On the February 1953 C&GS diagram runways 8L and 8R are each {{convert|6000|ft}} long and runway 3 is {{convert|5500|ft}}.\n\nThe $835,000 Terminal 1 (originally called the \"West Wing\") which also had the first [[control tower]], opened in October 1952.<ref name=\"tempe\"/> It was torn down in 1991 and replaced by a [[cellphone lot|cell phone waiting lot]], with Terminal 1's parking lot now being the West Economy lot.\n\nThe April 1957 OAG shows 42 scheduled airline departures a day: 16 American, 11 TWA, 10 Bonanza, and 5 Frontier.

{"title_page": "Regents Examinations", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=January 2010}}\nIn [[New York State]], '''Regents Examinations''' are statewide [[standardized examination]]s in core high school subjects. Students are required to pass these exams in order to earn a [[Regents Diploma]]. To graduate, students are required to have earned appropriate credits in a number of specific subjects by passing year-long or half-year courses, after which they must pass at least five Regents examinations in some of the subject areas. For higher-achieving students, a Regents with Advanced designation and an Honors designation are also offered. Students with disabilities or enrolled in an English as a Second Language program are able to earn a local diploma.\n\nStudents with mild disabilities are generally placed in special education Regents prep courses, which will lead them to either a local or Regents diploma if indicated in their documents. Students with moderate to severe disabilities who are deemed unable to pass the  Regents exams can earn a Career Development and Occupational Studies Commencement Credential<ref>[https://www.newsday.com/long-island/education/diploma-debate-li-parents-students-press-nys-for-changes-1.14091417 Diploma debate: LI parents, students press NYS for changes]; URL accessed November 22, 2017.</ref>, which will lead them to a local diploma.<ref>[https://www.newsday.com/long-island/education/regents-diploma-special-education-1.15394247 Regents endorse policy shift to help special-ed students get diploma]; URL accessed November 6, 2018.</ref>\n\n==Purpose==\nThe Regents Examinations are developed and administered by the [[New York State Education Department]] (NYSED) under the authority of the [[New York State Board of Regents|Board of Regents]] of the [[University of the State of New York]]. Regents exams are prepared by a conference of selected New York teachers of each test's specific discipline who assemble a test map that highlights the skills and knowledge required from the specific discipline's learning standards. The conferences meet and design the tests three years before the tests' issuance, which includes time for field testing and evaluating testing questions. \n \n\"At the close of each academic term, a public examination shall be held of all scholars presumed to have completed preliminary studies&hellip;To each scholar who sustains such examination, a certificate shall entitle the other person holding it to admission into the academic class in any academy subject to the visitation of the Regents, without further examination.\"<ref name=\"Watson\">{{citation |last=Watson|first=Robert S|title=Stability and Change in New York State Regents Mathematics Examinations, 1866-2009: a Socio-Historical Analysis|year=2010|publisher=UMI Dissertation Publishing|location=Ann Arbor, MI|id=UMI 3433796|pages=1\u20133}}</ref><ref name=\"NYSED_history\">{{cite web | title = History of Regents Examinations: 1865 to 1987 | url = http://www.p12.nysed.gov/apda/hsgen/archive/rehistory.htm | year = 1987 | last = NYSED | accessdate = 12 June 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120719060813/http://www.p12.nysed.gov/apda/hsgen/archive/rehistory.htm | archive-date = 2012-07-19 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nThe legislature\u2019s intent in establishing the Regents Examination system is described in the ordinance. The central idea of the legislation was to create an educational control system that could be used to regulate the flow of funds to the well established academy system of schools that existed throughout the state of New York. This goal would be accomplished by\n# creating a Regents Examination system, which would measure student achievement through process of examination; and\n# creating a new and privileged class of students in the secondary schools of New York.\nThe new class of students would be called the \u201cacademic class,\u201d and those students who qualified for admission to it by sustaining a process of examination would be known as \u201cacademic scholars.\u201d Academic scholars, and the institutions with which they were affiliated, would receive recognition and privilege under New York\u2019s school funding formula.<ref name=Watson/>\n\nThe focus of the ordinance was on assessing student achievement in the preliminary, or elementary curricula. In essence, the examinations were being positioned in the primary role of gatekeeper between the primary and secondary schools of the state of New York. The need for a gatekeeper examination system was due in part to the state\u2019s 1864 school funding formula, which allocated public funds to private academies based on criteria that included the number of enrolled students. Typically, the academies used money distributed from the state literature fund to offset operating expenses, and any expenses in excess of funds received from the State were passed on to students and their families in the form of \u201crate bills.\u201d Under this system, individual academies could realize economic advantages by lowering academic standards and enrolling less qualified students. In 1864, during a time of war, the New York legislature became concerned about this issue of who was and who was not qualified to be enrolled in the common, mostly private academies of the state and also in the rare, public high schools of the state. The timing of the legislature\u2019s concern and actions in 1864 may have been related to two conditions that existed during the Civil War: the military\u2019s need for young men of fighting age and a period of fiscal austerity in school funding.<ref name=Watson/>\n\n==History==\nThe first Regents Examinations were administered in November 1866. In 1878, the Regents Examination system was expanded to assess the curricula taught in the secondary schools of New York, and the Regents exams were first administered as high school end-of-course exams.<ref name=timeline>{{cite web | title = Timeline & History of New York State Assessments | url = http://www.p12.nysed.gov/apda/timeline-history.pdf | year = 2012 | last = NYSED | accessdate = 13 June 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120619212212/http://www.p12.nysed.gov/apda/timeline-history.pdf | archive-date = 2012-06-19 | url-status = dead }}</ref> From the original five exams (algebra, Latin, American History, natural philosophy [science], natural geography), the State Education Department expanded the Regents Exams offerings to forty-two tests in 1879; tests were administered in November, February, and June. In 1901, Regents Exams were given in [[rhetoric]], [[civics]], economics, [[Caesar]], [[Virgil]], [[Xenophon]], and [[physiology]].<ref>{{cite article\n|title=Canisteo: Its Prosperity at the Turn of the Century.

These included, but were not limited to, agricultural science, costume draping, and salesmanship.<ref name=NYSED_history/> By 1970 the number and types of Regents Exams changed to reflect the changes in high school curriculum: vocational exams were discontinued, and the sheer number of exams were either dropped or consolidated as the curricular emphasis trended toward comprehensive examinations rather than the singularly focused tests of the past.  This trend continued into the twenty-first century, with the cancellation of foreign language exams in 2010 and 2011.\n\nIn 1979, '''Regents Competency Tests''' were introduced for all students - in order to graduate students had to pass the RCT OR the Regents exam. Later, they were offered only to students with disabilities. They were discontinued with the class of 2015. In 2000, '''New York State Alternative Assessments''' (NYSAA) program was first administered allowing students with severe cognitive disabilities to complete a [[alternative assessment|datafolio-style assessment]] to demonstrate their performance toward achieving the New York State learning standards.<ref name=timeline/>\n\nThe June 2020 exams were not administered as a result of the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in New York (state)|coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n==Recent and future changes==\n\n===2010 changes===\nDue to budget cuts, in June 2010 the Board of Regents voted to cancel 7th Grade regents (Integrated Algebra, Geometry, and Living Environment) for students who were in 7th grade Honors/Accelerated Programs in Mathematics or in Science. German, Latin, and Hebrew Regents foreign language exams were also cancelled, and students studying those languages are now allowed to take a locally developed examination to demonstrate competency.<ref>http://www.regents.nysed.gov/meetings/2010Meetings/December2010/1210brca7.pdf</ref>\n\n===2011 changes===\nOn May 16, 2011, in the face of an $8 million budget gap, the Board of Regents voted to reduce the number of tests administered. The remaining foreign language exams (French, Italian, and Spanish) were eliminated, although districts may administer locally developed foreign language exams to let students attain a Regents Diploma with Advanced Designation. Tests administered during the month of January were to be canceled. In August 2011, New York City [[Michael Bloomberg|Mayor Michael Bloomberg]] and five private donors contributed funds to ensure that the Regents was administered in January 2012, although the foreign language exams remained cancelled.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/03/private-donors-including-mayor-save-january-regents/ | work=The New York Times | first=Sharon | last=Otterman | title=Private Donors, Including Mayor, Save January Regents | date=3 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nRegent scores are invalid for students that need three or fewer points to pass and are from schools that are viewed as struggling; such students can move on to next course without a regent score.\n\n===2012  change===\n\nStudents graduating in 2012 (who were 9th grade students in 2008) are the first [[Cohort (educational group)|cohort]] of students required to take all five Regents Exams with a passing score of 65 and obtain a Regents Diploma to graduate.<ref name=requirements/> Previously, school districts had been permitted to offer a '''Local Diploma''', with less stringent requirements than the Regents Diploma.

Under the proposal, students would be able to substitute a second Regents Exam in math or science or a vocational exam for this requirement. Another proposal under consideration would keep the Global History and Geography requirement, but split the test into two separate tests, one on Global History and another on Global Geography. NYSED accepts public comment and will provide a formal proposal to the Board of Regents. That proposal must be approved by the Board of Regents before the exam requirements can be changed. The proposal had since been denied.\n*In June 2014, Regents Exams in Comprehensive English, Algebra 1, and NYSAA will be aligned to the '''Common Core Learning Standards '''(CCLS).<ref>{{cite web| title = Common Core Implementation Timeline | url = http://engageny.org/resource/common-core-implementation-timeline/| date = 12 March 2012| last = NYSED |accessdate = 13 June 2012}}</ref> In June 2015, the Regents Exam in \"Geometry\" will be aligned with CCLS.

Instead of a comprehensive examination that covers material from two years, the new exam will cover information taught only in the 10th grade (1750-present). The new exam will also have a revised format: instead of 50 multiple choice questions, there will be only 30, but they will still be worth 55% of the grade. The thematic essay and document based question remain unchanged. <ref>{{cite web| title = Global History and Geography II Regents Exam| url = https://www.nysut.org/~/media/files/nysut/resources/2017/august/2017_08_factshhet_17_15_global_history_geography_ii_regents_exam.pdf?la=en| date = August 2017| last = NYSED |accessdate = 25 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nMost Regents exams are three hours long. The exception is the Earth Science exam, which consists of a 41-minute (approximate) laboratory component usually given up to two weeks prior to the three-hour written exam. Most Regents exams are structured in the following format: \n* A ''[[multiple-choice]] section'' (Part I) of usually between 30 and 50 questions\n* A ''long-answer/essay'' section (Part II) consisting of either a selection of detailed questions for which the work must be shown (for math and physical sciences), or a set of essay topics, of which one or two must be written about in detail (for the social sciences)\n\nIn 2005, the Board of Regents began modifying the mathematics curriculum. An integrated approach that taught topics in geometry and algebra during each of three years, with exams normally taken after a year and a half and again after three years, was replaced by a curriculum that divides topics into Algebra I, Geometry, and Algebra II/Trigonometry. Each of these take the form of a one-year course with a Regents Examination at the end of the year. The \"Math A\" and \"Math B\" exams have been eliminated and are replaced by \"Integrated Algebra\", \"Geometry\", and \"Algebra II and Trigonometry\".\n\nBeginning in January 2011, the English Language Arts exam was reduced from a six-hour exam to a three-hour exam. The exam still contains essay components, but has greater emphasis on reading comprehension and less on writing.<ref>http://www.nysut.org/newyorkteacher_14161.htm</ref>\n\nThe format of the laboratory practical for Earth Science was changed in 2008. Currently, it consists of three sections, each with a time limit of nine minutes. While administering the test, there are multiple stations for each section. Each station uses different data, but the same task. For example, each section 1 station may have different rocks and minerals, though the task is the same.\n\n==List of exams==\n\nThe New York State Regents Exams are the following:\n\n* United States History and Government  \n* [[Global History and Geography Regents Exam|Global History and Geography]] \n* English Language Arts\n* Algebra I  \n* Geometry  \n* Algebra II  \n* Living Environment\n* Earth Science: The Physical Setting\n* Chemistry: The Physical Setting\n* Physics: The Physical Setting\n\nThe Latin, German, Greek, and Hebrew language exams were removed after the 2009\u201310 school year, and the remaining language exams (Italian, Spanish, and French) were removed after the 2010\u201311 school year. Previously, a Regents foreign language exam was an option that would allow for Regents Exam with Advanced Designation. Currently, local school districts can develop their own exams to assess foreign language competency and allow for students to meet the Advanced Designation requirement.\n\n==Exam requirements==\nLocal Diplomas are offered by New York State school districts for students who did not pass the Regents Diploma requirements. For students entering 9th grade in September 2019 and thereafter, the Local Diploma is only offered to disabled students, and the rest of the students must attain at least a Regents Diploma. Advanced and Honors designations are available for exemplary students.

Similar to the regents diploma, the local diploma is recognized as a high school diploma, which would allow the student to attend college, enroll in the military, and have jobs that require a high school diploma. General Education students can only obtain the local diploma by appealing 2 regents exams. Students with disabilities must still have the appropriate number of credits to graduate. \n\nStudents who have an English as a Second Language are also able to obtain the local diploma simply by scoring 55 or higher in all 5 regents examinations required for high school graduation. \n\nThe safety nets include:\n\n\u00b7 '''Low Pass option''': Which students must earn at least 55-64 on a required regents exam to qualify for a local diploma. Students who score 52-54 can appeal that score. This option is available to all students with disabilities or with an English as a Second Language program. \n\n\u00b7 '''Compensatory option''': Students who score 45-54 on a required regents exam, but scores 65 or higher on another regents exam is able to compensate the 45-54 score using the 65+ score. The compensatory option may not be used to compensate the English or Math Regents exams, but the student may use the English and Math regents to compensate another regents exam scored 45-54 as long as they scored 65 or higher. This option is available to all students with disabilities only.\n\n===Regents Diploma exam requirements===\nIn 2014, the Board of Regents created the '''4+1''' option, where students must pass at least 4 regents exams\u2014one per subject\u2014and pass one additional Regents exam in any subject.\n\nStudents must score 65 or higher in:\n*English Language Arts \n*At least one math regents (Algebra I, Geometry, or Algebra II).\n*At least one science regents (Living Environment, Earth Science, Chemistry, or Physics)\n*At least one social studies regents (Global History or United States History and Government)\n*One additional Regents Exam in any subject or by passing a state-approved exam\n\n===Regents Diploma with Advanced Designation exam requirements===\nStudents must score 65 or higher in:\n*English Language Arts\n*All three math regents (Algebra I, Geometry, and Algebra II) \n*Living Environment and 1 physical science regents (Earth Science, Chemistry, or Physics)\n*Global History or United States History and Government.\nLote Exam in any Language that's not English\n\n===Additional honors designations===\nThe New York State Board of Regents offers the following honors to students with exemplary academic performance:\n*A student who earns an average score of 90 or higher (without rounding) on required exams is eligible for a Regents Diploma with Honors or a Regents Diploma with Advanced Designation with Honors.<ref name=\"hesc.ny.gov\">http://www.hesc.ny.gov/content.nsf/SFC/Regents_Requirements</ref>\n*A student who earns scores of 85 or higher on all of the required mathematics Regents Examinations is eligible for an annotation on their diploma that states that the student has mastery in mathematics.<ref>http://www.p12.nysed.gov/part100/pages/unitsofmathcredit.htm</ref>\n*A student who earns scores of 85 or higher on at least three science Regents Examinations is eligible for an annotation on their diploma that states that the student has mastery in science.<ref>http://www.hufsd.edu/assets/pdfs/schools/hhs/2013/letter_nys_diploma_seals.pdf</ref>\n\n===Scoring the Regents===\nThe scores reported for regents exams are not a sum or percentage of questions answered correctly. Instead, raw scores on the tests are converted on a curve to the officially reported scale scores. <ref>http://www.p12.nysed.gov/assessment/concht/scoring-regents.html</ref> This curve is customized to each year's group of tests. For example, for the Regents Examination in Algebra I given January 2019, a raw score on the test of 27 points (out of 86; so, 31% correct) would be given a scaled score of 65, that is, considered \"proficient\" for the purposes of being awarded the Regents Diploma. <ref>http://www.nysedregents.org/algebraone/119/algone12019-cc.pdf</ref>\n\n==Exemptions==\n\n===Alternative public schools===\nDuring the 1990s, some [[alternative assessment]] schools were founded in parts of New York in an attempt to provide a way for students to graduate from high school without taking any Regents Exams. Usually, the substitute graduation assessment consisted of a review and grading, by a panel of teachers, of an academic portfolio \u2014 a collection of the student's best work from all his or her years at the school. From such a \"portfolio examination\" would be issued a \"Regents equivalency\" grade for the areas of Math, English, History, and Science, and a \"Regents Equivalency\" diploma would be awarded to the student at commencement. Students enrolled in these schools do, however, take the English Regents exam as a part of the New York State school accountability system. \n\n===Private schools===\nThough all public schools are required to follow either the Regents Exam system or some form of alternative assessment, private schools need not. The vast majority of private schools do use Regents exams and award Regents diplomas, but some, usually academically prestigious private schools, do not. These schools' argument is that their own diploma requirements exceed Regents standards. Schools run by the [[Society of Jesus]], such as [[Canisius High School]], [[Fordham Preparatory School|Fordham Prep]], [[McQuaid Jesuit High School|McQuaid Jesuit]], [[Regis High School (New York City)|Regis]] and [[Xavier High School (New York City)|Xavier]], and by the [[Society of Mary (Marianists)]], such as [[Chaminade High School|Chaminade]] and [[Kellenberg Memorial High School|Kellenberg]], have not used Regents exams for decades. [[The Masters School]], [[The Ursuline School]], [[Hackley School|The Hackley School]], [[The Harvey School]], [[Long Island Lutheran Middle and High School|Long Island Lutheran Middle & High School]], [[Manlius Pebble Hill School]], and [[Nichols School]] also do not use the Regents system.\n\n===Allowable substitute examinations===\nSome [[Advanced Placement exams]] and [[SAT subject tests]] are allowable by NYSED as substitutes for the Regents Examination for that subject (e.g., AP United States History in place of the U.S. History and Government Regents).  NYSED has approved a small number of substitute exams and has published required scores for the exams.<ref>http://www.nysut.org/bulletins_15116.htm</ref>\n\n===Regents Competency Test===\n'''Regents Competency High School tests''', or simply '''RCT's''',<ref>[http://www.vesid.nysed.gov/specialed/publications/policy/chart-diploma.htm RCT exams] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090809231058/http://www.vesid.nysed.gov/specialed/publications/policy/chart-diploma.htm |date=2009-08-09 }}, accessed May 15, 2009</ref> are [[High school graduation examination in the United States|exit exams]] given to identified [[special education]] students with [[Individualized Education Program]]s or students with a [[Rehabilitation Act of 1973#Section 504|504 plan]] seeking a [[high school diploma]] but cannot pass the standard Regents exams. Like the Regents Examinations, the RCT is provided and overseen by NYSED, and is designed and administered under the authority of the Board of Regents.\n\nMost RCT's can be taken before a student takes the corresponding Regents exam. The RCT's are available for students until they graduate or when they turn 21. If the student still cannot pass all of the RCT exams, an [[Individualized Education Program#United States|Individualized Education Program Diploma]] (IEP Diploma) is awarded instead. The IEP Diploma is not the equivalent to a high school diploma, and rather is a certificate given to students who complete the twelfth grade but do not pass the standards based testing. The IEP Diploma is intended only for students with severe [[Intellectual disability|cognitive disabilities]].<ref>http://www.p12.nysed.gov/specialed/publications/iepdiploma.htm</ref>\n\n*Ninth grade\n**Students take the Math and Science RCT in June. This is done in case the students fail the Math and Living Environment Regents or Earth Science Regents which can be taken in 9th or 10th grade. Some students, however, can take Regents in 8th grade.\n*Tenth grade\n**Students take the Math and the Living Environment Regents or the Earth Science Regents in June. Students also take the Global History and Geography exam. Students can take the Global RCT if they failed the Global Regents.\n*Eleventh grade\n**Students take the Reading RCT in January. In June, students take the English and U.S. History Regents. Students can take the U.S. History RCT if they failed the U.S. History Regents.\n*Twelfth grade\n**Students take the Writing RCT in January if they have failed the English Regents.\n\nThere are six RCTs that are administered. They can be taken in January, June, and August. The Global and U.S. History Regents Exam is the only exception that does not allow students to take the RCT tests before student fails the corresponding Regents Exam.\n\nBeginning in the 2011-2012 school year, in public schools, only students with disabilities who first enter ninth grade prior to September 2011 are eligible to take the RCTs. Additional information on eligibility for the RCT safety net option has been provided by NYSED.<ref>http://www.p12.nysed.gov/specialed/publications/localdiplomaoptions-may2011.pdf\n</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.p12.nysed.gov/apda/sam/secondary/section1.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-06-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120626020025/http://www.p12.nysed.gov/apda/sam/secondary/section1.html |archive-date=2012-06-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n\n===General===\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120617122948/http://www.p12.nysed.gov/ciai/gradreq/revisedgradreq3column.pdf NYSED General Education and Diploma Requirements, November 2011]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120626011543/http://www.p12.nysed.gov/apda/hsgen/ NYSED Office of Assessment Policy, Development and Administration (APDA) High School General Information]\n* [http://www.nysedregents.org/ NYS Education Department Regents Exams]\n* [http://www.regents.nysed.gov/ NYS Board of Regents]\n* [http://www.p12.nysed.gov/part100/ Part 100 of the Regulations of the Commissioner of Education]\n\n===Test preparation===\n* [http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/regentsexams.htm NYS Regents Exams: New York State Library]\n*[http://www.newyorkscienceteacher.com/default/NYST/Site/regentspreparation.htm New York Science Teacher: New York State (NYS) Regents Preparation]\n* [https://sites.google.com/site/earthsciencenys/home The Physical Setting/Earth Science - #1 Earth Science Regents Review Website]\n* [http://www.jmap.org JMAP - Regents math examinations from 1866 to present.]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090130131133/http://regentsreviewlive.net/ Regents Review Live!], produced by The New York Network, a Service of the State University of New York, in collaboration with the Teacher Resource and Computer Training Centers of New York State\n[[Category:Standardized tests in the United States]]\n[[Category:Education in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:New York State Education Department]]\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove|date=January 2010}}\nIn [[New York State]], '''Regents Examinations''' are statewide [[standardized examination]]s in core high school subjects.

Regents exams are prepared by a conference of selected New York teachers of each test's specific discipline who assemble a test map that highlights the skills and knowledge required from the specific discipline's learning standards. The conferences meet and design the tests three years before the tests' issuance, which includes time for field testing and evaluating testing questions. \n \n\"At the close of each academic term, a public examination shall be held of all scholars presumed to have completed preliminary studies&hellip;To each scholar who sustains such examination, a certificate shall entitle the other person holding it to admission into the academic class in any academy subject to the visitation of the Regents, without further examination.\"<ref name=\"Watson\">{{citation |last=Watson|first=Robert S|title=Stability and Change in New York State Regents Mathematics Examinations, 1866-2009: a Socio-Historical Analysis|year=2010|publisher=UMI Dissertation Publishing|location=Ann Arbor, MI|id=UMI 3433796|pages=1\u20133}}</ref><ref name=\"NYSED_history\">{{cite web | title = History of Regents Examinations: 1865 to 1987 | url = http://www.p12.nysed.gov/apda/hsgen/archive/rehistory.htm | year = 1987 | last = NYSED | accessdate = 12 June 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120719060813/http://www.p12.nysed.gov/apda/hsgen/archive/rehistory.htm | archive-date = 2012-07-19 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nThe legislature\u2019s intent in establishing the Regents Examination system is described in the ordinance. The central idea of the legislation was to create an educational control system that could be used to regulate the flow of funds to the well established academy system of schools that existed throughout the state of New York. This goal would be accomplished by\n# creating a Regents Examination system, which would measure student achievement through process of examination; and\n# creating a new and privileged class of students in the secondary schools of New York.\nThe new class of students would be called the \u201cacademic class,\u201d and those students who qualified for admission to it by sustaining a process of examination would be known as \u201cacademic scholars.\u201d Academic scholars, and the institutions with which they were affiliated, would receive recognition and privilege under New York\u2019s school funding formula.<ref name=Watson/>\n\nThe focus of the ordinance was on assessing student achievement in the preliminary, or elementary curricula. In essence, the examinations were being positioned in the primary role of gatekeeper between the primary and secondary schools of the state of New York. The need for a gatekeeper examination system was due in part to the state\u2019s 1864 school funding formula, which allocated public funds to private academies based on criteria that included the number of enrolled students. Typically, the academies used money distributed from the state literature fund to offset operating expenses, and any expenses in excess of funds received from the State were passed on to students and their families in the form of \u201crate bills.\u201d Under this system, individual academies could realize economic advantages by lowering academic standards and enrolling less qualified students. In 1864, during a time of war, the New York legislature became concerned about this issue of who was and who was not qualified to be enrolled in the common, mostly private academies of the state and also in the rare, public high schools of the state. The timing of the legislature\u2019s concern and actions in 1864 may have been related to two conditions that existed during the Civil War: the military\u2019s need for young men of fighting age and a period of fiscal austerity in school funding.<ref name=Watson/>\n\n==History==\nThe first Regents Examinations were administered in November 1866. In 1878, the Regents Examination system was expanded to assess the curricula taught in the secondary schools of New York, and the Regents exams were first administered as high school end-of-course exams.<ref name=timeline>{{cite web | title = Timeline & History of New York State Assessments | url = http://www.p12.nysed.gov/apda/timeline-history.pdf | year = 2012 | last = NYSED | accessdate = 13 June 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120619212212/http://www.p12.nysed.gov/apda/timeline-history.pdf | archive-date = 2012-06-19 | url-status = dead }}</ref> From the original five exams (algebra, Latin, American History, natural philosophy [science], natural geography), the State Education Department expanded the Regents Exams offerings to forty-two tests in 1879; tests were administered in November, February, and June. In 1901, Regents Exams were given in [[rhetoric]], [[civics]], economics, [[Caesar]], [[Virgil]], [[Xenophon]], and [[physiology]].<ref>{{cite article\n|title=Canisteo: Its Prosperity at the Turn of the Century.

These included, but were not limited to, agricultural science, costume draping, and salesmanship.<ref name=NYSED_history/> By 1970 the number and types of Regents Exams changed to reflect the changes in high school curriculum: vocational exams were discontinued, and the sheer number of exams were either dropped or consolidated as the curricular emphasis trended toward comprehensive examinations rather than the singularly focused tests of the past.  This trend continued into the twenty-first century, with the cancellation of foreign language exams in 2010 and 2011.\n\nIn 1979, '''Regents Competency Tests''' were introduced for all students - in order to graduate students had to pass the RCT OR the Regents exam. Later, they were offered only to students with disabilities. They were discontinued with the class of 2015. In 2000, '''New York State Alternative Assessments''' (NYSAA) program was first administered allowing students with severe cognitive disabilities to complete a [[alternative assessment|datafolio-style assessment]] to demonstrate their performance toward achieving the New York State learning standards.<ref name=timeline/>\n\nThe June 2020 exams were not administered as a result of the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in New York|coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n==Recent and future changes==\n\n===2010 changes===\nDue to budget cuts, in June 2010 the Board of Regents voted to cancel 7th Grade regents (Integrated Algebra, Geometry, and Living Environment) for students who were in 7th grade Honors/Accelerated Programs in Mathematics or in Science. German, Latin, and Hebrew Regents foreign language exams were also cancelled, and students studying those languages are now allowed to take a locally developed examination to demonstrate competency.<ref>http://www.regents.nysed.gov/meetings/2010Meetings/December2010/1210brca7.pdf</ref>\n\n===2011 changes===\nOn May 16, 2011, in the face of an $8 million budget gap, the Board of Regents voted to reduce the number of tests administered. The remaining foreign language exams (French, Italian, and Spanish) were eliminated, although districts may administer locally developed foreign language exams to let students attain a Regents Diploma with Advanced Designation. Tests administered during the month of January were to be canceled. In August 2011, New York City [[Michael Bloomberg|Mayor Michael Bloomberg]] and five private donors contributed funds to ensure that the Regents was administered in January 2012, although the foreign language exams remained cancelled.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/03/private-donors-including-mayor-save-january-regents/ | work=The New York Times | first=Sharon | last=Otterman | title=Private Donors, Including Mayor, Save January Regents | date=3 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nRegent scores are invalid for students that need three or fewer points to pass and are from schools that are viewed as struggling; such students can move on to next course without a regent score.\n\n===2012  change===\n\nStudents graduating in 2012 (who were 9th grade students in 2008) are the first [[Cohort (educational group)|cohort]] of students required to take all five Regents Exams with a passing score of 65 and obtain a Regents Diploma to graduate.<ref name=requirements/> Previously, school districts had been permitted to offer a '''Local Diploma''', with less stringent requirements than the Regents Diploma.

Under the proposal, students would be able to substitute a second Regents Exam in math or science or a vocational exam for this requirement. Another proposal under consideration would keep the Global History and Geography requirement, but split the test into two separate tests, one on Global History and another on Global Geography. NYSED accepts public comment and will provide a formal proposal to the Board of Regents. That proposal must be approved by the Board of Regents before the exam requirements can be changed. The proposal had since been denied.\n*In June 2014, Regents Exams in Comprehensive English, Algebra 1, and NYSAA will be aligned to the '''Common Core Learning Standards '''(CCLS).<ref>{{cite web| title = Common Core Implementation Timeline | url = http://engageny.org/resource/common-core-implementation-timeline/| date = 12 March 2012| last = NYSED |accessdate = 13 June 2012}}</ref> In June 2015, the Regents Exam in \"Geometry\" will be aligned with CCLS.

These standards are a result of New York State's participation in the [[Common Core State Standards Initiative]].\n*In 2015, New York will begin administering computer-based standardized tests.<ref name=timeline/>{{dead link|date=January 2014}}\n*In August 2017, the Board of Regents approved changes to the Global History and Geography exam. Instead of a comprehensive examination that covers material from two years, the new exam will cover information taught only in the 10th grade (1750-present). The new exam will also have a revised format: instead of 50 multiple choice questions, there will be only 30, but they will still be worth 55% of the grade. The thematic essay and document based question remain unchanged. <ref>{{cite web| title = Global History and Geography II Regents Exam| url = https://www.nysut.org/~/media/files/nysut/resources/2017/august/2017_08_factshhet_17_15_global_history_geography_ii_regents_exam.pdf?la=en| date = August 2017| last = NYSED |accessdate = 25 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nMost Regents exams are three hours long. The exception is the Earth Science exam, which consists of a 41-minute (approximate) laboratory component usually given up to two weeks prior to the three-hour written exam. Most Regents exams are structured in the following format: \n* A ''[[multiple-choice]] section'' (Part I) of usually between 30 and 50 questions\n* A ''long-answer/essay'' section (Part II) consisting of either a selection of detailed questions for which the work must be shown (for math and physical sciences), or a set of essay topics, of which one or two must be written about in detail (for the social sciences)\n\nIn 2005, the Board of Regents began modifying the mathematics curriculum. An integrated approach that taught topics in geometry and algebra during each of three years, with exams normally taken after a year and a half and again after three years, was replaced by a curriculum that divides topics into Algebra I, Geometry, and Algebra II/Trigonometry. Each of these take the form of a one-year course with a Regents Examination at the end of the year. The \"Math A\" and \"Math B\" exams have been eliminated and are replaced by \"Integrated Algebra\", \"Geometry\", and \"Algebra II and Trigonometry\".\n\nBeginning in January 2011, the English Language Arts exam was reduced from a six-hour exam to a three-hour exam. The exam still contains essay components, but has greater emphasis on reading comprehension and less on writing.<ref>http://www.nysut.org/newyorkteacher_14161.htm</ref>\n\nThe format of the laboratory practical for Earth Science was changed in 2008. Currently, it consists of three sections, each with a time limit of nine minutes. While administering the test, there are multiple stations for each section. Each station uses different data, but the same task. For example, each section 1 station may have different rocks and minerals, though the task is the same.\n\n==List of exams==\n\nThe New York State Regents Exams are the following:\n\n* United States History and Government  \n* [[Global History and Geography Regents Exam|Global History and Geography]] \n* English Language Arts\n* Algebra I  \n* Geometry  \n* Algebra II  \n* Living Environment\n* Earth Science: The Physical Setting\n* Chemistry: The Physical Setting\n* Physics: The Physical Setting\n\nThe Latin, German, Greek, and Hebrew language exams were removed after the 2009\u201310 school year, and the remaining language exams (Italian, Spanish, and French) were removed after the 2010\u201311 school year. Previously, a Regents foreign language exam was an option that would allow for Regents Exam with Advanced Designation. Currently, local school districts can develop their own exams to assess foreign language competency and allow for students to meet the Advanced Designation requirement.\n\n==Exam requirements==\nLocal Diplomas are offered by New York State school districts for students who did not pass the Regents Diploma requirements. For students entering 9th grade in September 2019 and thereafter, the Local Diploma is only offered to disabled students, and the rest of the students must attain at least a Regents Diploma. Advanced and Honors designations are available for exemplary students. In addition to the Regents exam requirements, there are additional requirements for attaining a Regents or Regents with Advanced Designation Diploma, which are described in a NYSED handout titled \"General Education & Diploma Requirements\",<ref name=requirements>{{cite web| title = General Education & Diploma Requirements| last = [[NYSED]]| url = http://www.p12.nysed.gov/ciai/gradreq/revisedgradreq3column.pdf| date = November 2011| accessdate = 12 June 2012| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120617122948/http://www.p12.nysed.gov/ciai/gradreq/revisedgradreq3column.pdf| archive-date = 17 June 2012| url-status = dead| df = dmy-all}}</ref> and are codified in Section 100.5 of the '''Part 100 Regulations of the Commissioner of Education'''.<ref>http://www.p12.nysed.gov/part100/</ref>\n\nStudents must achieve a score of 65 (55 for Special Education students) or higher on Regents Exams to pass. <ref name=Regentsrulechangeaidsspecialeducation>[http://www.newsday.com/long-island/education/regents-rule-change-aids-special-education-1.4095211 Regents rule change aids special education]; URL accessed November 13, 2012.</ref> However this only qualifies for a local diploma as long as they compensate with a score of 65 or higher on another Regents exam.<ref name=Regentsrulechangeaidsspecialeducation/> Students with disabilities still must earn minimum 55 scores on Regents exams in Comprehensive English and math.<ref name=Regentsrulechangeaidsspecialeducation/> NYSED considers a score of 75 to 80 to indicate college readiness,<ref>{{cite press release | title = Grade 3-8 Math and English Test Results Released: Cut Scores Set to New College-Ready Proficiency Standards | publisher = NYSED | date = 28 July 2010 | url = http://www.oms.nysed.gov/press/Grade3-8_Results07282010.html | accessdate = 13 June 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120525005155/http://www.oms.nysed.gov/press/Grade3-8_Results07282010.html | archive-date = 2012-05-25 | url-status = dead }}</ref> with a score of 75 to 85 being a cutoff for admission for some selective colleges and universities and a score below 75 being a threshold for placement in remediation for some schools, including [[SUNY]] and [[CUNY]] schools.<ref>{{cite press release | title = July 28 Slide Presentation: A New Standard For Proficiency: College Readiness | publisher = NYSED | date = 28 July 2010 | url = http://www.oms.nysed.gov/press/PressConferencePresentationUPDATEDAM07_28.pdf | accessdate = 13 June 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110706012854/http://www.oms.nysed.gov/press/PressConferencePresentationUPDATEDAM07_28.pdf | archive-date = 2011-07-06 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n===Local Diploma exam requirements and information=== \nStudents with an Individualized Education Program or 504 plan are able to obtain a local diploma through 'safety nets'. Similar to the regents diploma, the local diploma is recognized as a high school diploma, which would allow the student to attend college, enroll in the military, and have jobs that require a high school diploma. General Education students can only obtain the local diploma by appealing 2 regents exams. Students with disabilities must still have the appropriate number of credits to graduate. \n\nStudents who have an English as a Second Language are also able to obtain the local diploma simply by scoring 55 or higher in all 5 regents examinations required for high school graduation. \n\nThe safety nets include:\n\n\u00b7 '''Low Pass option''': Which students must earn at least 55-64 on a required regents exam to qualify for a local diploma. Students who score 52-54 can appeal that score. This option is available to all students with disabilities or with an English as a Second Language program. \n\n\u00b7 '''Compensatory option''': Students who score 45-54 on a required regents exam, but scores 65 or higher on another regents exam is able to compensate the 45-54 score using the 65+ score. The compensatory option may not be used to compensate the English or Math Regents exams, but the student may use the English and Math regents to compensate another regents exam scored 45-54 as long as they scored 65 or higher. This option is available to all students with disabilities only.\n\n===Regents Diploma exam requirements===\nIn 2014, the Board of Regents created the '''4+1''' option, where students must pass at least 4 regents exams\u2014one per subject\u2014and pass one additional Regents exam in any subject.\n\nStudents must score 65 or higher in:\n*English Language Arts \n*At least one math regents (Algebra I, Geometry, or Algebra II).\n*At least one science regents (Living Environment, Earth Science, Chemistry, or Physics)\n*At least one social studies regents (Global History or United States History and Government)\n*One additional Regents Exam in any subject or by passing a state-approved exam\n\n===Regents Diploma with Advanced Designation exam requirements===\nStudents must score 65 or higher in:\n*English Language Arts\n*All three math regents (Algebra I, Geometry, and Algebra II) \n*Living Environment and 1 physical science regents (Earth Science, Chemistry, or Physics)\n*Global History or United States History and Government.\nLote Exam in any Language that's not English\n\n===Additional honors designations===\nThe New York State Board of Regents offers the following honors to students with exemplary academic performance:\n*A student who earns an average score of 90 or higher (without rounding) on required exams is eligible for a Regents Diploma with Honors or a Regents Diploma with Advanced Designation with Honors.<ref name=\"hesc.ny.gov\">http://www.hesc.ny.gov/content.nsf/SFC/Regents_Requirements</ref>\n*A student who earns scores of 85 or higher on all of the required mathematics Regents Examinations is eligible for an annotation on their diploma that states that the student has mastery in mathematics.<ref>http://www.p12.nysed.gov/part100/pages/unitsofmathcredit.htm</ref>\n*A student who earns scores of 85 or higher on at least three science Regents Examinations is eligible for an annotation on their diploma that states that the student has mastery in science.<ref>http://www.hufsd.edu/assets/pdfs/schools/hhs/2013/letter_nys_diploma_seals.pdf</ref>\n\n===Scoring the Regents===\nThe scores reported for regents exams are not a sum or percentage of questions answered correctly. Instead, raw scores on the tests are converted on a curve to the officially reported scale scores. <ref>http://www.p12.nysed.gov/assessment/concht/scoring-regents.html</ref> This curve is customized to each year's group of tests. For example, for the Regents Examination in Algebra I given January 2019, a raw score on the test of 27 points (out of 86; so, 31% correct) would be given a scaled score of 65, that is, considered \"proficient\" for the purposes of being awarded the Regents Diploma. <ref>http://www.nysedregents.org/algebraone/119/algone12019-cc.pdf</ref>\n\n==Exemptions==\n\n===Alternative public schools===\nDuring the 1990s, some [[alternative assessment]] schools were founded in parts of New York in an attempt to provide a way for students to graduate from high school without taking any Regents Exams. Usually, the substitute graduation assessment consisted of a review and grading, by a panel of teachers, of an academic portfolio \u2014 a collection of the student's best work from all his or her years at the school. From such a \"portfolio examination\" would be issued a \"Regents equivalency\" grade for the areas of Math, English, History, and Science, and a \"Regents Equivalency\" diploma would be awarded to the student at commencement. Students enrolled in these schools do, however, take the English Regents exam as a part of the New York State school accountability system. \n\n===Private schools===\nThough all public schools are required to follow either the Regents Exam system or some form of alternative assessment, private schools need not. The vast majority of private schools do use Regents exams and award Regents diplomas, but some, usually academically prestigious private schools, do not. These schools' argument is that their own diploma requirements exceed Regents standards. Schools run by the [[Society of Jesus]], such as [[Canisius High School]], [[Fordham Preparatory School|Fordham Prep]], [[McQuaid Jesuit High School|McQuaid Jesuit]], [[Regis High School (New York City)|Regis]] and [[Xavier High School (New York City)|Xavier]], and by the [[Society of Mary (Marianists)]], such as [[Chaminade High School|Chaminade]] and [[Kellenberg Memorial High School|Kellenberg]], have not used Regents exams for decades. [[The Masters School]], [[The Ursuline School]], [[Hackley School|The Hackley School]], [[The Harvey School]], [[Long Island Lutheran Middle and High School|Long Island Lutheran Middle & High School]], [[Manlius Pebble Hill School]], and [[Nichols School]] also do not use the Regents system.\n\n===Allowable substitute examinations===\nSome [[Advanced Placement exams]] and [[SAT subject tests]] are allowable by NYSED as substitutes for the Regents Examination for that subject (e.g., AP United States History in place of the U.S. History and Government Regents).  NYSED has approved a small number of substitute exams and has published required scores for the exams.<ref>http://www.nysut.org/bulletins_15116.htm</ref>\n\n===Regents Competency Test===\n'''Regents Competency High School tests''', or simply '''RCT's''',<ref>[http://www.vesid.nysed.gov/specialed/publications/policy/chart-diploma.htm RCT exams] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090809231058/http://www.vesid.nysed.gov/specialed/publications/policy/chart-diploma.htm |date=2009-08-09 }}, accessed May 15, 2009</ref> are [[High school graduation examination in the United States|exit exams]] given to identified [[special education]] students with [[Individualized Education Program]]s or students with a [[Rehabilitation Act of 1973#Section 504|504 plan]] seeking a [[high school diploma]] but cannot pass the standard Regents exams. Like the Regents Examinations, the RCT is provided and overseen by NYSED, and is designed and administered under the authority of the Board of Regents.\n\nMost RCT's can be taken before a student takes the corresponding Regents exam. The RCT's are available for students until they graduate or when they turn 21. If the student still cannot pass all of the RCT exams, an [[Individualized Education Program#United States|Individualized Education Program Diploma]] (IEP Diploma) is awarded instead. The IEP Diploma is not the equivalent to a high school diploma, and rather is a certificate given to students who complete the twelfth grade but do not pass the standards based testing. The IEP Diploma is intended only for students with severe [[Intellectual disability|cognitive disabilities]].<ref>http://www.p12.nysed.gov/specialed/publications/iepdiploma.htm</ref>\n\n*Ninth grade\n**Students take the Math and Science RCT in June. This is done in case the students fail the Math and Living Environment Regents or Earth Science Regents which can be taken in 9th or 10th grade. Some students, however, can take Regents in 8th grade.\n*Tenth grade\n**Students take the Math and the Living Environment Regents or the Earth Science Regents in June. Students also take the Global History and Geography exam. Students can take the Global RCT if they failed the Global Regents.\n*Eleventh grade\n**Students take the Reading RCT in January. In June, students take the English and U.S. History Regents. Students can take the U.S. History RCT if they failed the U.S. History Regents.\n*Twelfth grade\n**Students take the Writing RCT in January if they have failed the English Regents.\n\nThere are six RCTs that are administered. They can be taken in January, June, and August. The Global and U.S. History Regents Exam is the only exception that does not allow students to take the RCT tests before student fails the corresponding Regents Exam.\n\nBeginning in the 2011-2012 school year, in public schools, only students with disabilities who first enter ninth grade prior to September 2011 are eligible to take the RCTs. Additional information on eligibility for the RCT safety net option has been provided by NYSED.<ref>http://www.p12.nysed.gov/specialed/publications/localdiplomaoptions-may2011.pdf\n</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.p12.nysed.gov/apda/sam/secondary/section1.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-06-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120626020025/http://www.p12.nysed.gov/apda/sam/secondary/section1.html |archive-date=2012-06-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n\n===General===\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120617122948/http://www.p12.nysed.gov/ciai/gradreq/revisedgradreq3column.pdf NYSED General Education and Diploma Requirements, November 2011]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120626011543/http://www.p12.nysed.gov/apda/hsgen/ NYSED Office of Assessment Policy, Development and Administration (APDA) High School General Information]\n* [http://www.nysedregents.org/ NYS Education Department Regents Exams]\n* [http://www.regents.nysed.gov/ NYS Board of Regents]\n* [http://www.p12.nysed.gov/part100/ Part 100 of the Regulations of the Commissioner of Education]\n\n===Test preparation===\n* [http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/regentsexams.htm NYS Regents Exams: New York State Library]\n*[http://www.newyorkscienceteacher.com/default/NYST/Site/regentspreparation.htm New York Science Teacher: New York State (NYS) Regents Preparation]\n* [https://sites.google.com/site/earthsciencenys/home The Physical Setting/Earth Science - #1 Earth Science Regents Review Website]\n* [http://www.jmap.org JMAP - Regents math examinations from 1866 to present.]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090130131133/http://regentsreviewlive.net/ Regents Review Live!], produced by The New York Network, a Service of the State University of New York, in collaboration with the Teacher Resource and Computer Training Centers of New York State\n[[Category:Standardized tests in the United States]]\n[[Category:Education in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:New York State Education Department]]\n", "name_user": "LittleWink", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links to2020 coronavirus pandemic in New York(link changed to2020 coronavirus pandemic in New York (state)) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regents_Examinations"}

Only one percent of respondents chose it as their [[color preferences|favorite color]].<ref>Heller, Eva, ''Psychologie de la Couleur'', p. 224-242</ref>\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==Etymology==\n''Grey'' comes from the Middle English ''grai'' or ''grei'', from the Anglo-Saxon ''graeg'', and is related to the Dutch ''grauw'' and ''grijs'' and German ''grau''.<ref>''Webster's New World Dictionary of the American Language'', 1964.</ref> The first recorded use of ''grey'' as a color name in the [[English language]] was in AD 700.<ref name=\"Paul Page 196\"/>\n\n==In history and art==\n\n===Antiquity through the Middle Ages===\nIn antiquity and the Middle Ages, grey was the color of undyed wool, and thus was the color most commonly worn by peasants and the poor. It was also the color worn by [[Cistercian]] monks and friars of the [[Franciscan]] and [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] orders as a symbol of their vows of humility and poverty. Franciscan friars in England and Scotland were commonly known as the [[grey friars]], and that name is now attached to many places in Great Britain.\n\n===Renaissance and the Baroque===\nDuring the Renaissance and the Baroque, grey began to play an important role in fashion and art. Black became the most popular color of the nobility, particularly in Italy, France, and Spain, and grey and white were harmonious with it.\n\nGrey was also frequently used for the drawing of oil paintings, a technique called ''[[grisaille]]''. The painting would first be composed in grey and white, and then the colors, made with thin transparent glazes, would be added on top. The grisaille beneath would provide the shading, visible through the layers of color. Sometimes the grisaille was simply left uncovered, giving the appearance of carved stone.\n\nGrey was a particularly good background color for gold and for skin tones. It became the most common background for the portraits of [[Rembrandt Van Rijn]] and for many of the paintings of [[El Greco]], who used it to highlight the faces and costumes of the central figures. The palette of Rembrandt was composed almost entirely of somber colors. He composed his warm greys out of black pigments made from charcoal or burnt animal bones, mixed with lead white or a white made of lime, which he warmed with a little [[red lake]] color from [[cochineal]] or [[rose madder|madder]]. In one painting, the portrait of Margaretha de Geer (1661), one part of a grey wall in the background is painted with a layer of dark brown over a layer of orange, red, and yellow earths, mixed with ivory black and some [[lead white]]. Over this he put an additional layer of glaze made of mixture of [[blue smalt]], [[red ochre]], and [[yellow lake]]. Using these ingredients and many others, he made greys which had, according to art historian Philip Ball, \"an incredible subtlety of pigmentation.\"<ref>Philip Ball (2001), ''Bright Earth, Art and the Invention of Coulour'', pp. 214\u2013215 (French translation).</ref> The warm, dark and rich greys and browns served to emphasize the golden light on the faces in the paintings.\n\n===Eighteenth and nineteenth centuries===\nGrey became a highly fashionable color in the 18th century, both for women's dresses and for men's waistcoats and coats. It looked particularly luminous coloring the silk and satin fabrics worn by the nobility and wealthy.\n\nWomen's fashion in the 19th century was dominated by Paris, while men's fashion was set by London. The grey business suit appeared in the mid-19th century in London; light grey in summer, dark grey in winter; replacing the more colorful palette of men's clothing early in the century.\n\nThe clothing of women working in the factories and workshops of Paris in the 19th century was usually grey. This gave them the name of ''grisettes''. \"''Gris''\" or grey also meant drunk, and the name \"''grisette''\" was also given to the lower class of Parisian prostitutes.\n\nGrey also became a common color for [[military]] uniforms; in an age of rifles with longer range, soldiers in grey were less visible as targets than those in blue or red. Grey was the color of the uniforms of the [[Confederate Army]] during the [[American Civil War]], and of the [[Prussian Army]] for active service wear from 1910 onwards.\n\nSeveral artists of the mid-19th century used tones of grey to create memorable paintings; [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]] used tones of green-grey and blue grey to give harmony to his landscapes, and [[James McNeill Whistler]] created a special grey for the background of the portrait of his mother, and for his own self-portrait.\n\nWhistler's arrangement of tones of grey had an effect on the world of music, on the French composer [[Claude Debussy]]. In 1894, Debussy wrote to violinist [[Eug\u00e8ne Ysa\u00ffe]] describing his ''[[Nocturnes (Debussy)|Nocturnes]]'' as \"an experiment in the combinations that can be obtained from one color \u2013 what a study in grey would be in painting.\"<ref>Weintraub, Stanley. 2001. ''Whistler: a biography'' (New York: Da Capo Press). {{ISBN|978-0-306-80971-2}}. p. 351</ref>\n\n===Twentieth and twenty-first centuries===\nIn the late 1930s, grey became a symbol of industrialization and war. It was the dominant color of [[Pablo Picasso]]'s celebrated painting about the horrors of the [[Spanish Civil War]], ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]''.<ref>Stefano Zuffi, (2012), ''Color in Art'', pg. 310</ref>\n\nAfter the war, the grey business suit became a metaphor for uniformity of thought, popularized in such books as ''[[The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit]]'' (1955), which became a successful film in 1956.<ref>Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur- effets et symboliques'', pg. 236-237</ref>\n\n==In the sciences, nature, and technology==\n\n===Storm clouds===\n[[File:Storm Clouds towards Clare island - geograph.org.uk - 1032378.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Storm clouds toward [[Clare Island]], [[Ireland]]]]\nThe whiteness or darkness of clouds is a function of their depth. Small, fluffy white clouds in summer look white because the sunlight is being scattered by the tiny water droplets they contain, and that white light comes to the viewer's eye. However, as clouds become larger and thicker, the white light cannot penetrate through the cloud, and is reflected off the top. Clouds look darkest grey during thunderstorms, when they can be as much as 20,000 to 30,000 feet high.\n\nStratiform clouds are a layer of clouds that covers the entire sky, and which have a depth of between a few hundred to a few thousand feet thick. The thicker the clouds, the darker they appear from below, because little of the sunlight is able to pass through. From above, in an airplane, the same clouds look perfectly white, but from the ground the sky looks gloomy and gray.<ref>{{cite web |title=Why are some clouds white, while others are dark? |author=John Hehr |publisher=Research Frontiers - The home of Research at the University of Arkansas |date=October 15, 2002 |url=https://researchfrontiers.uark.edu/why-are-some-clouds-white-while-others-are-dark/ |access-date=2019-11-05 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190820025451/https://researchfrontiers.uark.edu/why-are-some-clouds-white-while-others-are-dark/ |archive-date=2019-08-20}}</ref>\n\n===The greying of hair===\nThe color of a person's hair is created by the pigment [[melanin]], found in the core of each hair. Melanin is also responsible for the color of the skin and of the eyes. There are only two types of pigment: dark ([[eumelanin]]) or light ([[phaeomelanin]]). Combined in various combinations, these pigments create all natural hair colors.\n\nMelanin itself is the product of a specialized cell, the [[melanocyte]], which is found in each [[hair follicle]], from which the hair grows. As hair grows, the melanocyte injects melanin into the hair cells, which contain the protein [[keratin]] and which makes up our hair, skin, and nails. As long as the melanocytes continue injecting melanin into the hair cells, the hair retains its original color. At a certain age, however, which varies from person to person, the amount of melanin injected is reduced and eventually stops. The hair, without pigment, turns grey and eventually white. The reason for this decline of production of melanocytes is uncertain. In the February 2005 issue of ''Science'', a team of Harvard scientists suggested that the cause was the failure of the melanocyte stem cells to maintain the production of the essential pigments, due to age or genetic factors, after a certain period of time. For some people, the breakdown comes in their twenties; for others, many years later.<ref>[https://www.loc.gov/rr/scitech/mysteries/grayhair.html Library of Congress Science Reference Services] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102152657/http://www.loc.gov/rr/scitech/mysteries/grayhair.html |date=2013-01-02}}</ref> According to the site of the magazine ''Scientific American'', \"Generally speaking, among Caucasians 50 percent are 50 percent grey by age 50.\"<ref>[https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-does-hair-turn-gray/ ''Scientific American'', \"Why does hair turn gray?\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131114132915/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=why-does-hair-turn-gray |date=2013-11-14}}</ref> Adult male [[gorilla]]s also develop silver hair, but only on their backs - see [[gorilla#Physical characteristics|Physical characteristics of gorillas]].\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:UMP regional elections IlM 2010-02-18 n07.jpg|[[Christine Lagarde]], head of the International Monetary Fund\nFile:Donald Sutherland 2012.jpg|Actor [[Donald Sutherland]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Optics===\nOver the centuries, artists have traditionally created grey by mixing black and white in various proportions. They added a little red to make a warmer grey, or a little blue for a cooler grey. Artists could also make a grey by mixing two [[complementary colors]], such as [[orange (colour)|orange]] and [[blue]].\n\nToday the grey on televisions, computer displays, and telephones is usually created using the [[RGB color model]]. Red, green, and blue light combined at full intensity on the black screen makes white; by lowering the intensity, it is possible to create shades of grey.\n\nIn printing, grey is usually obtained with the [[CMYK color model]], using [[cyan]], [[magenta]], [[yellow]], and [[black]]. Grey is produced either by using black and white, or by combining equal amounts of cyan, magenta, and yellow. Most greys have a cool or warm cast to them, as the [[human eye]] can detect even a minute amount of color saturation. [[Yellow]], [[orange (colour)|orange]], and [[red]] create a \"warm grey\". [[Green]], [[blue]], and [[violet (color)|violet]] create a \"cool grey\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://atmos.uw.edu/gcg/SV.man/sv.743colpal.html |title=Color Palette |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191105231218/https://atmos.uw.edu/gcg/SV.man/sv.743colpal.html |archive-date=2019-11-05}}</ref> When no color is added, the color is \"neutral grey\", \"achromatic grey\", or simply \"grey\".

Another anomaly is that ''gray'' is in fact much darker than the X11 color marked ''darkgray''; this is because of a conflict with the original HTML gray and the X11 gray, which is closer to HTML's ''silver''. The three ''slategray'' colors are not themselves on the greyscale, but are slightly [[saturation (colour theory)|saturated]] toward [[cyan]] (green + blue). Since there are an even (256, including black and white) number of [[saturation (colour theory)|unsaturated]] tones of grey, there are two grey tones straddling the [[midpoint]] in the 8-bit greyscale. The color name ''gray'' has been assigned the lighter of the two shades (128, also known as #808080), due to rounding up.\n\n===Pigments===\nUntil the 19th century, artists traditionally created grey by simply combining black and white. [[Rembrandt Van Rijn]], for instance, usually used [[lead white]] and either [[carbon black]] or [[ivory black]], along with touches of either blues or reds to cool or warm the grey.\n\nIn the early 19th century, a new grey, [[Payne's grey]], appeared on the market. Payne's grey is a dark [[blue-gray]], a mixture of [[ultramarine]] and [[black]] or of ultramarine and [[sienna]]. It is named after [[William Payne (painter)|William Payne]], a British artist who painted [[watercolor]]s in the late 18th century. The first recorded use of ''Payne's grey'' as a color name in [[English language|English]] was in 1835.<ref>Maerz and Paul ''A Dictionary of Color'' New York:1930 McGraw-Hill Page 201; Colour Sample of Payne\u2019s Grey: Page 117 Plate 47 Color Sample A9</ref>\n\n===Animal color===\nGrey is a very common color for animals, birds, and fish, ranging in size from whales to mice. It provides a natural camouflage and allows them to blend with their surroundings.\n\n===Grey matter of the brain===\nThe substance that composes the [[brain]] is sometimes referred to as [[grey matter]], or \"the little grey cells\", so the color grey is associated with things [[intellectual]]. However, the living human brain is actually [[pink]] in color; it only turns grey when dead.\n\n===Nanotechnology and ''grey goo''===\n[[Grey goo]] is a hypothetical [[end of civilization|end-of-the-world]] scenario, also known as [[ecophagy]]: out-of-control [[self replication|self-replicating]] [[nanobot]]s consume all living matter on [[Earth]] while building more of themselves.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.crnano.org/PR-IOP.htm |date=June 9, 2004 |title=Leading nanotech experts put 'grey goo' in perspective |publisher=Center for Responsible Nanotechnology |accessdate=2006-06-17 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140906221148/http://www.crnano.org/PR-IOP.htm |archivedate=September 6, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Grey noise===\nIn sound engineering, [[grey noise]] is [[random noise]] subjected to a [[psychoacoustic]] [[equal loudness curve]], such as an ''inverted'' [[A-weighting]] curve, over a given range of frequencies, giving the listener the perception that it is equally loud at all frequencies.\n\n==In culture==\n\n===Religion===\nIn the Christian religion, grey is the color of ashes, and so a [[Bible|biblical]] symbol of [[mourning]] and [[repentance]], described as [[mortification of the flesh|sackcloth and ashes]]. It can be used during [[Lent]] or on special days of [[fasting]] and [[prayer]]. As the color of humility and modesty, grey is worn by friars of the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin]] and [[Franciscan order]] as well as monks of the [[Cistercian order]].<ref>Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur- effets et symboliques'', pg. 235</ref> Grey cassocks are worn by clergy of the [[Brazilian Catholic Apostolic Church]].\n\nBuddhist monks and priests in Japan and Korea will often wear a sleeved grey, brown, or black outer robe.\n\n[[Taoist]] priests in China also often wear grey.\n\n===Politics===\nGrey is rarely used as a color by political parties, largely because of its common association with conformity, boredom and indecision. An example of a political party using grey as a color are the German [[The Greys \u2013 Grey Panthers|Grey Panthers]].\n\nThe term \"grey power\" or \"the grey vote\" is sometimes used to describe the influence of older voters as a voting bloc. In the United States, older people are more likely to vote, and usually vote to protect certain social benefits, such as [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]].<ref>[http://www.capitalgazette.com/lifestyle/columnists/bonus_years/the-bonus-years-the-grey-vote-may-take-the-cake/article_511751fe-be95-5844-b631-c5d7aa00f9ca.html The Bonus Years: The 'grey vote' may take the cake on Tuesday] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20130118184656/http://www.capitalgazette.com/lifestyle/columnists/bonus_years/the-bonus-years-the-grey-vote-may-take-the-cake/article_511751fe-be95-5844-b631-c5d7aa00f9ca.html |date=2013-01-18}}</ref><ref>[http://www.macmillandictionary.com/buzzword/entries/grey-vote.html Grey vote] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030005726/http://www.macmillandictionary.com/buzzword/entries/grey-vote.html |date=2012-10-30}}</ref>\n\n''Greys'' is a term sometimes used pejoratively by [[environmentalist]]s in the [[green movement]] to describe those who oppose environmental measures and supposedly prefer the grey of concrete and cement.\n\n===Military===\nDuring the [[American Civil War]], the soldiers of the [[Confederate Army]] wore grey uniforms. At the beginning of the war, The armies of the North and of the South had very similar uniforms; some Confederate units wore blue, and some Union units wore grey. There naturally was confusion, and sometimes soldiers fired by mistake at soldiers of their own army. On June 6, 1861, the Confederate government issued regulations standardizing the army uniform and establishing [[cadet grey]] as the uniform color. This was (and still is) the color of the uniform of cadets at the [[United States Military Academy]] at West Point, and cadets at the [[Virginia Military Institute]], which produced many officers for the Confederacy.\n\nThe new uniforms were designed by [[Nicola Marschall]], a German-American artist, who also designed the original [[Confederate flag]]. He closely followed the design of contemporary French and Austrian military uniforms.<ref name=\"ADAH\">{{cite web |title=Nicola Marschall: Artist of the Deep South |url=https://archives.alabama.gov/marschall/NM_dsth.html |publisher=Alabama Department of Archives and History |accessdate=26 September 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090823034204/http://www.archives.state.al.us/marschall/NM_dsth.html |archivedate=23 August 2009}}</ref> Grey was not chosen for its camouflage value; this was not appreciated for several more decades; but because the South did not have a major dye industry and grey dyes were inexpensive and easy to manufacture. While some units had uniforms colored with good-quality dyes, which were a solid bluish-grey, others had uniforms colored with vegetable dyes made from [[sumac]] or [[logwood]], which quickly faded in sunshine to the yellowish color of [[butternut squash]].\n\nThe [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] wore grey uniforms from 1907 until 1945, during both the [[First World War]] and [[Second World War]]. The color chosen was a grey-green called [[feldgrau|field grey]] ({{Lang-de|links=no|feldgrau}}). It was chosen because it was less visible at a distance than the previous German uniforms, which were [[Prussian blue]]. It was one of the first uniform colors to be chosen for its [[camouflage]] value, important in the new age of smokeless powder and more accurate rifles and machine guns. It gave the Germans a distinct advantage at the beginning of the First World War, when the French soldiers were dressed in blue jackets and red trousers. The [[Finnish Army]] also began using grey uniforms on the German model.\n\nSome of the more recent uniforms of the [[German Army]] and [[East German Army]] were field grey, as were some uniforms of the [[Swedish army]]. The formal dress (M/83) of the [[Finnish Army]] is grey. The [[Army of Chile]] wears field grey today.\n\n===The grey suit===\nDuring the 19th century, women's fashions were largely dictated by Paris, while London set fashions for men. The intent of a business suit was above all to show seriousness, and to show one's position in business and society. Over the course of the century, bright colors disappeared from men's fashion, and were largely replaced by a black or dark charcoal grey [[frock coat]] in winter, and lighter greys in summer. In the early 20th century, the frock coat was gradually replaced by the [[lounge suit]], a less formal version of evening dress, which was also usually black or charcoal grey. In the 1930s the English suit style was called the [[drape suit]], with wide shoulders and a nipped waist, usually dark or light grey. After World War II, the style changed to a slimmer fit called the continental cut, but the color remained grey.<ref>Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur - effets et symboliques'', pg. 236</ref>\n\n===Sports===\n* In [[baseball]], grey is the color typically used for road [[baseball uniform|uniforms]]. This came about because in the 19th and early 20th century, away teams didn't normally have access to laundry facilities on the road, thus stains were not noticeable on the darker grey uniforms as opposed to the white uniforms worn by the home team.\n\n===Gay culture===\n* In [[gay slang]], a ''grey queen'' is a gay person who works for the [[financial services]] industry (this term originates from the fact that in the 1950s, people who worked in this [[profession]] often wore grey flannel suits).<ref>Rodgers, Bruce ''Gay Talk (The Queen's Vernacular): A Dictionary of Gay Slang'' New York:1972 Parragon Books, an imprint of G.P. Putnam\u2019s Sons Page 99</ref>\n\n==Associations and symbolism==\nIn America and Europe, grey is one of the least popular colors; In a European survey, only one percent of men said it was their favorite color, and thirteen percent called it their least favorite color; the response from women was almost the same. According to color historian Eva Heller, \"grey is too weak to be considered masculine, but too menacing to be considered a feminine color. It is neither warm nor cold, neither [[materials science|material]] or [[spirituality|spiritual]]. With grey, nothing seems to be decided.\"<ref>Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur, effets et symboliques''. (Pg. 226)</ref> It also denotes undefinedness, as in a [[wikt:grey area|grey area]].\n\nGrey is the color most commonly associated in many cultures with the elderly and old age, because of the association with grey hair; it symbolizes the wisdom and dignity that come with experience and age. The New York Times is sometimes called ''The Grey Lady'' because of its long history and esteemed position in American journalism.<ref>Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur- effets et symboliques'', pg. 234.</ref>\n\nGrey is the color most often associated in Europe and America with modesty.<ref>Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur, effets et symboliques''.

It was also the color worn by [[Cistercian]] monks and friars of the [[Franciscan]] and [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] orders as a symbol of their vows of humility and poverty. Franciscan friars in England and Scotland were commonly known as the [[grey friars]], and that name is now attached to many places in Great Britain.\n\n===Renaissance and the Baroque===\nDuring the Renaissance and the Baroque, grey began to play an important role in fashion and art. Black became the most popular color of the nobility, particularly in Italy, France, and Spain, and grey and white were harmonious with it.\n\nGrey was also frequently used for the drawing of oil paintings, a technique called ''[[grisaille]]''. The painting would first be composed in grey and white, and then the colors, made with thin transparent glazes, would be added on top. The grisaille beneath would provide the shading, visible through the layers of color. Sometimes the grisaille was simply left uncovered, giving the appearance of carved stone.\n\nGrey was a particularly good background color for gold and for skin tones. It became the most common background for the portraits of [[Rembrandt Van Rijn]] and for many of the paintings of [[El Greco]], who used it to highlight the faces and costumes of the central figures. The palette of Rembrandt was composed almost entirely of somber colors. He composed his warm greys out of black pigments made from charcoal or burnt animal bones, mixed with lead white or a white made of lime, which he warmed with a little [[red lake]] color from [[cochineal]] or [[rose madder|madder]]. In one painting, the portrait of Margaretha de Geer (1661), one part of a grey wall in the background is painted with a layer of dark brown over a layer of orange, red, and yellow earths, mixed with ivory black and some [[lead white]]. Over this he put an additional layer of glaze made of mixture of [[blue smalt]], [[red ochre]], and [[yellow lake]]. Using these ingredients and many others, he made greys which had, according to art historian Philip Ball, \"an incredible subtlety of pigmentation.\"<ref>Philip Ball (2001), ''Bright Earth, Art and the Invention of Coulour'', pp. 214\u2013215 (French translation).</ref> The warm, dark and rich greys and browns served to emphasize the golden light on the faces in the paintings.\n\n===Eighteenth and nineteenth centuries===\nGrey became a highly fashionable color in the 18th century, both for women's dresses and for men's waistcoats and coats. It looked particularly luminous coloring the silk and satin fabrics worn by the nobility and wealthy.\n\nWomen's fashion in the 19th century was dominated by Paris, while men's fashion was set by London. The grey business suit appeared in the mid-19th century in London; light grey in summer, dark grey in winter; replacing the more colorful palette of men's clothing early in the century.\n\nThe clothing of women working in the factories and workshops of Paris in the 19th century was usually grey. This gave them the name of ''grisettes''. \"''Gris''\" or grey also meant drunk, and the name \"''grisette''\" was also given to the lower class of Parisian prostitutes.\n\nGrey also became a common color for [[military]] uniforms; in an age of rifles with longer range, soldiers in grey were less visible as targets than those in blue or red. Grey was the color of the uniforms of the [[Confederate Army]] during the [[American Civil War]], and of the [[Prussian Army]] for active service wear from 1910 onwards.\n\nSeveral artists of the mid-19th century used tones of grey to create memorable paintings; [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]] used tones of green-grey and blue grey to give harmony to his landscapes, and [[James McNeill Whistler]] created a special grey for the background of the portrait of his mother, and for his own self-portrait.\n\nWhistler's arrangement of tones of grey had an effect on the world of music, on the French composer [[Claude Debussy]]. In 1894, Debussy wrote to violinist [[Eug\u00e8ne Ysa\u00ffe]] describing his ''[[Nocturnes (Debussy)|Nocturnes]]'' as \"an experiment in the combinations that can be obtained from one color \u2013 what a study in grey would be in painting.\"<ref>Weintraub, Stanley. 2001. ''Whistler: a biography'' (New York: Da Capo Press). {{ISBN|978-0-306-80971-2}}. p. 351</ref>\n\n===Twentieth and twenty-first centuries===\nIn the late 1930s, grey became a symbol of industrialization and war. It was the dominant color of [[Pablo Picasso]]'s celebrated painting about the horrors of the [[Spanish Civil War]], ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]''.<ref>Stefano Zuffi, (2012), ''Color in Art'', pg. 310</ref>\n\nAfter the war, the grey business suit became a metaphor for uniformity of thought, popularized in such books as ''[[The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit]]'' (1955), which became a successful film in 1956.<ref>Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur- effets et symboliques'', pg. 236-237</ref>\n\n==In the sciences, nature, and technology==\n\n===Storm clouds===\n[[File:Storm Clouds towards Clare island - geograph.org.uk - 1032378.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Storm clouds toward [[Clare Island]], [[Ireland]]]]\nThe whiteness or darkness of clouds is a function of their depth. Small, fluffy white clouds in summer look white because the sunlight is being scattered by the tiny water droplets they contain, and that white light comes to the viewer's eye. However, as clouds become larger and thicker, the white light cannot penetrate through the cloud, and is reflected off the top. Clouds look darkest grey during thunderstorms, when they can be as much as 20,000 to 30,000 feet high.\n\nStratiform clouds are a layer of clouds that covers the entire sky, and which have a depth of between a few hundred to a few thousand feet thick. The thicker the clouds, the darker they appear from below, because little of the sunlight is able to pass through. From above, in an airplane, the same clouds look perfectly white, but from the ground the sky looks gloomy and gray.<ref>{{cite web |title=Why are some clouds white, while others are dark? |author=John Hehr |publisher=Research Frontiers - The home of Research at the University of Arkansas |date=October 15, 2002 |url=https://researchfrontiers.uark.edu/why-are-some-clouds-white-while-others-are-dark/ |access-date=2019-11-05 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190820025451/https://researchfrontiers.uark.edu/why-are-some-clouds-white-while-others-are-dark/ |archive-date=2019-08-20}}</ref>\n\n===The greying of hair===\nThe color of a person's hair is created by the pigment [[melanin]], found in the core of each hair. Melanin is also responsible for the color of the skin and of the eyes. There are only two types of pigment: dark ([[eumelanin]]) or light ([[phaeomelanin]]). Combined in various combinations, these pigments create all natural hair colors.\n\nMelanin itself is the product of a specialized cell, the [[melanocyte]], which is found in each [[hair follicle]], from which the hair grows. As hair grows, the melanocyte injects melanin into the hair cells, which contain the protein [[keratin]] and which makes up our hair, skin, and nails. As long as the melanocytes continue injecting melanin into the hair cells, the hair retains its original color. At a certain age, however, which varies from person to person, the amount of melanin injected is reduced and eventually stops. The hair, without pigment, turns grey and eventually white. The reason for this decline of production of melanocytes is uncertain. In the February 2005 issue of ''Science'', a team of Harvard scientists suggested that the cause was the failure of the melanocyte stem cells to maintain the production of the essential pigments, due to age or genetic factors, after a certain period of time. For some people, the breakdown comes in their twenties; for others, many years later.<ref>[https://www.loc.gov/rr/scitech/mysteries/grayhair.html Library of Congress Science Reference Services] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102152657/http://www.loc.gov/rr/scitech/mysteries/grayhair.html |date=2013-01-02}}</ref> According to the site of the magazine ''Scientific American'', \"Generally speaking, among Caucasians 50 percent are 50 percent grey by age 50.\"<ref>[https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-does-hair-turn-gray/ ''Scientific American'', \"Why does hair turn gray?\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131114132915/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=why-does-hair-turn-gray |date=2013-11-14}}</ref> Adult male [[gorilla]]s also develop silver hair, but only on their backs - see [[gorilla#Physical characteristics|Physical characteristics of gorillas]].\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:UMP regional elections IlM 2010-02-18 n07.jpg|[[Christine Lagarde]], head of the International Monetary Fund\nFile:Donald Sutherland 2012.jpg|Actor [[Donald Sutherland]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Optics===\nOver the centuries, artists have traditionally created grey by mixing black and white in various proportions. They added a little red to make a warmer grey, or a little blue for a cooler grey. Artists could also make a grey by mixing two [[complementary colors]], such as [[orange (colour)|orange]] and [[blue]].\n\nToday the grey on televisions, computer displays, and telephones is usually created using the [[RGB color model]]. Red, green, and blue light combined at full intensity on the black screen makes white; by lowering the intensity, it is possible to create shades of grey.\n\nIn printing, grey is usually obtained with the [[CMYK color model]], using [[cyan]], [[magenta]], [[yellow]], and [[black]]. Grey is produced either by using black and white, or by combining equal amounts of cyan, magenta, and yellow. Most greys have a cool or warm cast to them, as the [[human eye]] can detect even a minute amount of color saturation. [[Yellow]], [[orange (colour)|orange]], and [[red]] create a \"warm grey\". [[Green]], [[blue]], and [[violet (color)|violet]] create a \"cool grey\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://atmos.uw.edu/gcg/SV.man/sv.743colpal.html |title=Color Palette |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191105231218/https://atmos.uw.edu/gcg/SV.man/sv.743colpal.html |archive-date=2019-11-05}}</ref> When no color is added, the color is \"neutral grey\", \"achromatic grey\", or simply \"grey\".

All are spelled ''gray'', using the spelling ''grey'' can cause errors. This spelling was inherited from the [[X11 colour names|X11 color list]]. [[Internet Explorer]]'s [[Trident (layout engine)|Trident browser engine]] does not recognize ''grey'' and renders it green. Another anomaly is that ''gray'' is in fact much darker than the X11 color marked ''darkgray''; this is because of a conflict with the original HTML gray and the X11 gray, which is closer to HTML's ''silver''. The three ''slategray'' colors are not themselves on the greyscale, but are slightly [[saturation (colour theory)|saturated]] toward [[cyan]] (green + blue). Since there are an even (256, including black and white) number of [[saturation (colour theory)|unsaturated]] tones of grey, there are two grey tones straddling the [[midpoint]] in the 8-bit greyscale. The color name ''gray'' has been assigned the lighter of the two shades (128, also known as #808080), due to rounding up.\n\n===Pigments===\nUntil the 19th century, artists traditionally created grey by simply combining black and white. [[Rembrandt Van Rijn]], for instance, usually used [[lead white]] and either [[carbon black]] or [[ivory black]], along with touches of either blues or reds to cool or warm the grey.\n\nIn the early 19th century, a new grey, [[Payne's grey]], appeared on the market. Payne's grey is a dark [[blue-gray]], a mixture of [[ultramarine]] and [[black]] or of ultramarine and [[sienna]]. It is named after [[William Payne (painter)|William Payne]], a British artist who painted [[watercolor]]s in the late 18th century. The first recorded use of ''Payne's grey'' as a color name in [[English language|English]] was in 1835.<ref>Maerz and Paul ''A Dictionary of Color'' New York:1930 McGraw-Hill Page 201; Colour Sample of Payne\u2019s Grey: Page 117 Plate 47 Color Sample A9</ref>\n\n===Animal color===\nGrey is a very common color for animals, birds, and fish, ranging in size from whales to mice. It provides a natural camouflage and allows them to blend with their surroundings.\n\n===Grey matter of the brain===\nThe substance that composes the [[brain]] is sometimes referred to as [[grey matter]], or \"the little grey cells\", so the color grey is associated with things [[intellectual]]. However, the living human brain is actually [[pink]] in color; it only turns grey when dead.\n\n===Nanotechnology and ''grey goo''===\n[[Grey goo]] is a hypothetical [[end of civilization|end-of-the-world]] scenario, also known as [[ecophagy]]: out-of-control [[self replication|self-replicating]] [[nanobot]]s consume all living matter on [[Earth]] while building more of themselves.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.crnano.org/PR-IOP.htm |date=June 9, 2004 |title=Leading nanotech experts put 'grey goo' in perspective |publisher=Center for Responsible Nanotechnology |accessdate=2006-06-17 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140906221148/http://www.crnano.org/PR-IOP.htm |archivedate=September 6, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Grey noise===\nIn sound engineering, [[grey noise]] is [[random noise]] subjected to a [[psychoacoustic]] [[equal loudness curve]], such as an ''inverted'' [[A-weighting]] curve, over a given range of frequencies, giving the listener the perception that it is equally loud at all frequencies.\n\n==In culture==\n\n===Religion===\nIn the Christian religion, grey is the color of ashes, and so a [[Bible|biblical]] symbol of [[mourning]] and [[repentance]], described as [[mortification of the flesh|sackcloth and ashes]]. It can be used during [[Lent]] or on special days of [[fasting]] and [[prayer]]. As the color of humility and modesty, grey is worn by friars of the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin]] and [[Franciscan order]] as well as monks of the [[Cistercian order]].<ref>Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur- effets et symboliques'', pg. 235</ref> Grey cassocks are worn by clergy of the [[Brazilian Catholic Apostolic Church]].\n\nBuddhist monks and priests in Japan and Korea will often wear a sleeved grey, brown, or black outer robe.\n\n[[Taoist]] priests in China also often wear grey.\n\n===Politics===\nGrey is rarely used as a color by political parties, largely because of its common association with conformity, boredom and indecision. An example of a political party using grey as a color are the German [[The Greys \u2013 Grey Panthers|Grey Panthers]].\n\nThe term \"grey power\" or \"the grey vote\" is sometimes used to describe the influence of older voters as a voting bloc. In the United States, older people are more likely to vote, and usually vote to protect certain social benefits, such as [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]].<ref>[http://www.capitalgazette.com/lifestyle/columnists/bonus_years/the-bonus-years-the-grey-vote-may-take-the-cake/article_511751fe-be95-5844-b631-c5d7aa00f9ca.html The Bonus Years: The 'grey vote' may take the cake on Tuesday] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20130118184656/http://www.capitalgazette.com/lifestyle/columnists/bonus_years/the-bonus-years-the-grey-vote-may-take-the-cake/article_511751fe-be95-5844-b631-c5d7aa00f9ca.html |date=2013-01-18}}</ref><ref>[http://www.macmillandictionary.com/buzzword/entries/grey-vote.html Grey vote] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030005726/http://www.macmillandictionary.com/buzzword/entries/grey-vote.html |date=2012-10-30}}</ref>\n\n''Greys'' is a term sometimes used pejoratively by [[environmentalist]]s in the [[green movement]] to describe those who oppose environmental measures and supposedly prefer the grey of concrete and cement.\n\n===Military===\nDuring the [[American Civil War]], the soldiers of the [[Confederate Army]] wore grey uniforms. At the beginning of the war, The armies of the North and of the South had very similar uniforms; some Confederate units wore blue, and some Union units wore grey. There naturally was confusion, and sometimes soldiers fired by mistake at soldiers of their own army. On June 6, 1861, the Confederate government issued regulations standardizing the army uniform and establishing [[cadet grey]] as the uniform color. This was (and still is) the color of the uniform of cadets at the [[United States Military Academy]] at West Point, and cadets at the [[Virginia Military Institute]], which produced many officers for the Confederacy.\n\nThe new uniforms were designed by [[Nicola Marschall]], a German-American artist, who also designed the original [[Confederate flag]]. He closely followed the design of contemporary French and Austrian military uniforms.<ref name=\"ADAH\">{{cite web |title=Nicola Marschall: Artist of the Deep South |url=https://archives.alabama.gov/marschall/NM_dsth.html |publisher=Alabama Department of Archives and History |accessdate=26 September 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090823034204/http://www.archives.state.al.us/marschall/NM_dsth.html |archivedate=23 August 2009}}</ref> Grey was not chosen for its camouflage value; this was not appreciated for several more decades; but because the South did not have a major dye industry and grey dyes were inexpensive and easy to manufacture. While some units had uniforms colored with good-quality dyes, which were a solid bluish-grey, others had uniforms colored with vegetable dyes made from [[sumac]] or [[logwood]], which quickly faded in sunshine to the yellowish color of [[butternut squash]].\n\nThe [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] wore grey uniforms from 1907 until 1945, during both the [[First World War]] and [[Second World War]]. The color chosen was a grey-green called [[feldgrau|field grey]] ({{Lang-de|links=no|feldgrau}}). It was chosen because it was less visible at a distance than the previous German uniforms, which were [[Prussian blue]]. It was one of the first uniform colors to be chosen for its [[camouflage]] value, important in the new age of smokeless powder and more accurate rifles and machine guns. It gave the Germans a distinct advantage at the beginning of the First World War, when the French soldiers were dressed in blue jackets and red trousers. The [[Finnish Army]] also began using grey uniforms on the German model.\n\nSome of the more recent uniforms of the [[German Army]] and [[East German Army]] were field grey, as were some uniforms of the [[Swedish army]]. The formal dress (M/83) of the [[Finnish Army]] is grey. The [[Army of Chile]] wears field grey today.\n\n===The grey suit===\nDuring the 19th century, women's fashions were largely dictated by Paris, while London set fashions for men. The intent of a business suit was above all to show seriousness, and to show one's position in business and society. Over the course of the century, bright colors disappeared from men's fashion, and were largely replaced by a black or dark charcoal grey [[frock coat]] in winter, and lighter greys in summer. In the early 20th century, the frock coat was gradually replaced by the [[lounge suit]], a less formal version of evening dress, which was also usually black or charcoal grey. In the 1930s the English suit style was called the [[drape suit]], with wide shoulders and a nipped waist, usually dark or light grey. After World War II, the style changed to a slimmer fit called the continental cut, but the color remained grey.<ref>Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur - effets et symboliques'', pg. 236</ref>\n\n===Sports===\n* In [[baseball]], grey is the color typically used for road [[baseball uniform|uniforms]]. This came about because in the 19th and early 20th century, away teams didn't normally have access to laundry facilities on the road, thus stains were not noticeable on the darker grey uniforms as opposed to the white uniforms worn by the home team.\n\n===Gay culture===\n* In [[gay slang]], a ''grey queen'' is a gay person who works for the [[financial services]] industry (this term originates from the fact that in the 1950s, people who worked in this [[profession]] often wore grey flannel suits).<ref>Rodgers, Bruce ''Gay Talk (The Queen's Vernacular): A Dictionary of Gay Slang'' New York:1972 Parragon Books, an imprint of G.P. Putnam\u2019s Sons Page 99</ref>\n\n==Associations and symbolism==\nIn America and Europe, grey is one of the least popular colors; In a European survey, only one percent of men said it was their favorite color, and thirteen percent called it their least favorite color; the response from women was almost the same. According to color historian Eva Heller, \"grey is too weak to be considered masculine, but too menacing to be considered a feminine color. It is neither warm nor cold, neither [[materials science|material]] or [[spirituality|spiritual]]. With grey, nothing seems to be decided.\"<ref>Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur, effets et symboliques''. (Pg. 226)</ref> It also denotes undefinedness, as in a [[wikt:grey area|grey area]].\n\nGrey is the color most commonly associated in many cultures with the elderly and old age, because of the association with grey hair; it symbolizes the wisdom and dignity that come with experience and age. The New York Times is sometimes called ''The Grey Lady'' because of its long history and esteemed position in American journalism.<ref>Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur- effets et symboliques'', pg. 234.</ref>\n\nGrey is the color most often associated in Europe and America with modesty.<ref>Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur, effets et symboliques''.

The club is represented in the [[Danish Superliga]] and has won four [[List of Danish football champions|Danish football Championships]] and three [[Danish Cup]] trophies. Most recently the team won [[Double (association football)|the double]] in 2014.\n\nIn 1995 AaB became the first Danish team to participate in the [[1995\u201396 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]] group stage when they were awarded a place because [[Dynamo Kiev]] was expelled from the tournament after one game for attempted match-fixing. AaB qualified for the [[2008\u201309 UEFA Champions League|2008\u201309 Champions League]] and is with two appearances the Danish club who has participated the second most in the tournament after [[F.C. Copenhagen]].\n\n==History==\nAalborg BK was part of the top-flight Danish leagues from the 1928\u201329 season, until the [[relegation]] of the club in 1947. The club returned to the best league in 1963, and except from the years of 1972, 1978 and 1981\u20131986, Aalborg BK has since been a part of the various editions of the [[Danish football championship]]. Despite its many years in the Danish championship, the club never won a championship title, but Aalborg BK won the [[Danish Cup]] competition in 1966 and 1970. Paid football was introduced in Denmark by the [[Danish Football Association]] in 1978. As Aalborg BK returned to the best Danish league, the club founded the professional branch of ''AaB A/S'' in 1987 to run a professional football team.<ref>{{in lang|da}} [http://www.aab.klubfodbold.dk/default.asp?pageid=114 Om Aalborg Boldspilklub af 1885] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308095605/http://www.aab.klubfodbold.dk/default.asp?pageid=114 |date=8 March 2008 }} at ''Aalborg Boldspilklub af 1885''</ref>\n\nThrough the 1990s, the club won its first two Danish championships. In the [[Danish Superliga 1994-95]] season, 24 goals from league topscorer [[Erik Bo Andersen]] secured the championship title for the team of coach [[Poul Erik Andreasen]]. The club was initially eliminated by [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]] in the qualification matches for the [[UEFA Champions League 1995-96]], but following a bribing scandal Kyiv was banned from the tournament and Aalborg BK entered in their place. Aalborg BK thus became the first Danish team to compete in the UEFA Champions League. As they managed a 2\u20131 home win over [[Panathinaikos FC|Panathinaikos]] and a 2\u20132 draw with [[FC Porto|Porto]] in the six matches the club played in the initial group stage, Aalborg BK was eliminated. Erik Bo Andersen left the club for Scottish club [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]], but in [[S\u00f8ren Frederiksen (footballer, born 1972)|S\u00f8ren Frederiksen]], the club found its next goal-getter. Though not the league top scorer, Frederiksen scored 17 goals in the [[Danish Superliga 1998-99]] which the club won under guidance of Swedish coach [[Hans Backe]]. Once again, Aalborg BK faced Dinamo Kyiv in the Champions League qualification, but again felt short, losing 1\u20132 at home and drawing 2\u20132 in Kyiv after a late Aalborg BK goal was disallowed for being behind the goal line.\n\nSince then, the club established itself in the top half of the Superliga and won a bronze medal and qualified for the [[2007 UEFA Intertoto Cup]]. Aalborg beat [[FC Honka|Honka]] on the [[away goals rule]] (2\u20132 in Finland and 1\u20131 in Denmark) in the second round, and in the third and final round Aalborg BK faced [[K.A.A. Gent|Gent]] and drew, 1\u20131, in the away game but beat them 2\u20131 in the following home match. Thus they \"won\" a place in the [[UEFA Cup]]'s second qualification round and met [[Helsingin Jalkapalloklubi|HJK]], the first match ended 2\u20131 to Helsinki, but in the last match Aalborg BK won 3\u20130 and were thus ready for the [[UEFA Cup 2007-08]]. Drawing the Italian team [[U.C. Sampdoria|Sampdoria]] in the First Round, which have [[Antonio Cassano]] and [[Vincenzo Montella]] as notable players, made the task seem impossible. Aalborg made it again on the away goal rule (getting 2\u20132 in [[Genoa]] and managing 0\u20130 in [[Aalborg]]), and qualified for the group stage&nbsp;\u2013 being the first Danish team ever, to send an Italian team \"out of Europe.\" In the group stage Aalborg BK was seeded in the lowest pot, and drew [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]], [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], [[Getafe CF|Getafe]], and [[Hapoel Tel Aviv F.C.|Hapoel Tel Aviv]]. Drawing with Anderlecht at home, and losing 2\u20133 to Tottenham (after being ahead 2\u20130 after the first half) forced Aalborg to win at home against Getafe, a match Aalborg BK lost 1\u20132.\n\nIn the 2007\u201308 season, Aalborg won their third Danish Championship and qualified for the [[2008\u201309 UEFA Champions League]] qualifying rounds. in the second qualifying round, Aalborg easily eliminated [[FK Modri\u010da]] 7\u20131 on aggregate. In the third round, before the group stage, they defeated [[FBK Kaunas]] 2\u20130 both at home and away and reached the group stage of the Champions League for the second time, the first time a Danish team achieved this. In the group stage, they were drawn in Group E along with defending champions [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], [[Villarreal CF|Villarreal]] and [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]].  Aalborg finished third in the group, ahead of Celtic, with 6 points and progressed to the [[2008\u201309 UEFA Cup]] knockout stage.\n\nTheir first match in their UEFA Cup run was against Spanish side [[Deportivo de La Coru\u00f1a]]. Aalborg BK won the first leg at home 3\u20130 and the second leg at the [[Estadio Riazor]] 1\u20133, securing a 6\u20131 aggregate. Aalborg BK thereby earned a place among the last 16 teams. where they faced [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]. After a 2\u20130 loss in [[Manchester]] in the first leg Aalborg BK fought back to tie the score with a 2\u20130 win at home. The tie ended in agony however, as Aalborg were defeated by 4\u20133 on penalties.\n\nOn 11 May 2014, the club won their 4th Danish Championship, and four days later [[Double (association football)|the double]] was secured, as the club defeated [[F.C. Copenhagen]] 4\u20132 in the Cup final.\n\n==Stadium==\n{{Main|Nordjyske Arena}}\n[[File:Aalborg Stadion.jpg|thumbnail|right|The northern facade of Nordjyske Arena, 2008.]]\nSince 1920, Aalborg BK has played its games at Aalborg Stadion. The stadium was opened on 18 July 1920 with a north-south aligned playing field. The first spectator seats was built in 1927, and in 1937 a wooden terrace for 3,000 standing spectators was built. In 1960, the stadium burned down and a new east-western aligned concrete stadium was opened in 1962. In recent years the stadium have been enlarged and rebuilt so that it now has modern facilities and roof over all spectator stands.<ref>{{in lang|da}} [http://www.aalborg.dk/Borgerportal/Serviceomraader/Kultur+og+Fritid/Fritid/Aalborg+Stadion/Stadion+Historie.htm Aalborg Stadion 1920\u20132001]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''Aalborg.dk'', 8 February 2006</ref> The stadium currently has the capacity of 13,997 people (8,997 seats) or 10,500 people (all seats).\n\n==Players==\n\n===Current squad===\n{{updated|27 February 2020}}<ref>https://aabsport.dk/holdet/spillertruppen/</ref>\n{{Fs start}}\n{{Fs player|no= 1|nat=SWE|pos=GK|name=[[Jacob Rinne]]}}\n{{Fs player|no= 2|nat=DEN|pos=DF|name=[[Patrick Kristensen]]}}\n{{Fs player|no= 3|nat=DEN|pos=DF|name=[[Jakob Ahlmann Nielsen|Jakob Ahlmann]]}}\n{{Fs player|no= 5|nat=DEN|pos=DF|name=[[Jores Okore]]}}\n{{Fs player|no= 6|nat=DEN|pos=DF|name=[[Kristoffer Pallesen]]}}\n{{Fs player|no= 8|nat=NOR|pos=MF|name=[[Iver Fossum]]}}\n{{Fs player|no= 9|nat=NED|pos=FW|name=[[Tom van Weert]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=10|nat=DEN|pos=MF|name=[[Lucas Andersen]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=15|nat=DEN|pos=DF|name=[[Lukas Klitten]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=16|nat=DEN|pos=MF|name=[[Magnus Christensen]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=17|nat=DEN|pos=MF|name=[[Kasper Kusk]]}}\n{{Fs mid}}\n{{Fs player|no=19|nat=CAN|pos=FW|name=[[Aramis Kouzine]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=20|nat=DEN|pos=MF|name=[[Oliver Klitten]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=21|nat=DEN|pos=MF|name=[[Patrick Olsen]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=22|nat=DEN|pos=GK|name=Andreas Hansen}}\n{{Fs player|no=23|nat=UGA|pos=MF|name=[[Robert Kakeeto]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=24|nat=DEN|pos=DF|name=[[Mathias Ross]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=25|nat=DEN|pos=MF|name=[[Frederik B\u00f8rsting]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=26|nat=DEN|pos=DF|name=[[Rasmus Thelander]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=27|nat=DEN|pos=MF|name=[[S\u00f8ren Tengstedt]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=32|nat=DEN|pos=DF|name=[[Kasper Pedersen]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=34|nat=DEN|pos=DF|name=[[Anders B\u00e6rtelsen]]}}\n{{Fs end}}\n\n===Out on loan===\n{{Fs start}}\n{{Fs player|no=\u2014 |nat=DEN|pos=MF|name=[[Oliver Abildgaard]]|other=<small>at [[Rubin Kazan]] until 30 June 2020}}\n{{Fs player|no=\u2014 |nat=DEN|pos=MF|name=[[Rasmus Thellufsen]]|other=<small>at [[Hansa Rostock]] until 30 June 2020}}\n{{Fs player|no=\u2014 |nat=SVK|pos=MF|name=[[Filip Lesniak]]|other=<small>at [[Silkeborg IF]] until 30 June 2020}}\n{{Fs mid}}\n{{Fs player|no=\u2014 |nat=DEN|pos=DF|name=[[Jakob Bl\u00e5bjerg]]|other=<small>at [[Vendsyssel FF]] until 30 June 2020}}\n{{Fs player|no=\u2014 |nat=DEN|pos=FW|name=[[Wessam Abou Ali]]|other=<small>at [[Vendsyssel FF]] until 30 June 2020}}\n{{Fs end}}\n\n===Retired numbers===\n<big>'''12'''</big>&nbsp;\u2013 {{flagicon|Denmark}} [[Torben Boye]], [[Defender (football)|defender]] (1984\u20132001)\n\n===Notable former players===\n{{See also|Category:AaB Fodbold players}}\n\n==Current management==\n* Sports director [[Thomas B\u00e6lum]] & [[Jacob Friis (footballer)|Jacob Friis]] (2019\u2013)\n* Head coach [[Jacob Friis]] (2018\u2013)\n* Assistant coach [[Allan K.

BK'''<ref>[http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/association=den/domesticleague/index.html Denmark&nbsp;\u2013 Danish Super League] UEFA.com</ref> is a professional [[association football|football team]] located in [[Aalborg]]. The club is represented in the [[Danish Superliga]] and has won four [[List of Danish football champions|Danish football Championships]] and three [[Danish Cup]] trophies. Most recently the team won [[Double (association football)|the double]] in 2014.\n\nIn 1995 AaB became the first Danish team to participate in the [[1995\u201396 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]] group stage when they were awarded a place because [[Dynamo Kiev]] was expelled from the tournament after one game for attempted match-fixing. AaB qualified for the [[2008\u201309 UEFA Champions League|2008\u201309 Champions League]] and is with two appearances the Danish club who has participated the second most in the tournament after [[F.C. Copenhagen]].\n\n==History==\nAalborg BK was part of the top-flight Danish leagues from the 1928\u201329 season, until the [[relegation]] of the club in 1947. The club returned to the best league in 1963, and except from the years of 1972, 1978 and 1981\u20131986, Aalborg BK has since been a part of the various editions of the [[Danish football championship]]. Despite its many years in the Danish championship, the club never won a championship title, but Aalborg BK won the [[Danish Cup]] competition in 1966 and 1970. Paid football was introduced in Denmark by the [[Danish Football Association]] in 1978. As Aalborg BK returned to the best Danish league, the club founded the professional branch of ''AaB A/S'' in 1987 to run a professional football team.<ref>{{in lang|da}} [http://www.aab.klubfodbold.dk/default.asp?pageid=114 Om Aalborg Boldspilklub af 1885] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308095605/http://www.aab.klubfodbold.dk/default.asp?pageid=114 |date=8 March 2008 }} at ''Aalborg Boldspilklub af 1885''</ref>\n\nThrough the 1990s, the club won its first two Danish championships. In the [[Danish Superliga 1994-95]] season, 24 goals from league topscorer [[Erik Bo Andersen]] secured the championship title for the team of coach [[Poul Erik Andreasen]]. The club was initially eliminated by [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]] in the qualification matches for the [[UEFA Champions League 1995-96]], but following a bribing scandal Kyiv was banned from the tournament and Aalborg BK entered in their place. Aalborg BK thus became the first Danish team to compete in the UEFA Champions League. As they managed a 2\u20131 home win over [[Panathinaikos FC|Panathinaikos]] and a 2\u20132 draw with [[FC Porto|Porto]] in the six matches the club played in the initial group stage, Aalborg BK was eliminated. Erik Bo Andersen left the club for Scottish club [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]], but in [[S\u00f8ren Frederiksen (footballer, born 1972)|S\u00f8ren Frederiksen]], the club found its next goal-getter. Though not the league top scorer, Frederiksen scored 17 goals in the [[Danish Superliga 1998-99]] which the club won under guidance of Swedish coach [[Hans Backe]]. Once again, Aalborg BK faced Dinamo Kyiv in the Champions League qualification, but again felt short, losing 1\u20132 at home and drawing 2\u20132 in Kyiv after a late Aalborg BK goal was disallowed for being behind the goal line.\n\nSince then, the club established itself in the top half of the Superliga and won a bronze medal and qualified for the [[2007 UEFA Intertoto Cup]]. Aalborg beat [[FC Honka|Honka]] on the [[away goals rule]] (2\u20132 in Finland and 1\u20131 in Denmark) in the second round, and in the third and final round Aalborg BK faced [[K.A.A. Gent|Gent]] and drew, 1\u20131, in the away game but beat them 2\u20131 in the following home match. Thus they \"won\" a place in the [[UEFA Cup]]'s second qualification round and met [[Helsingin Jalkapalloklubi|HJK]], the first match ended 2\u20131 to Helsinki, but in the last match Aalborg BK won 3\u20130 and were thus ready for the [[UEFA Cup 2007-08]]. Drawing the Italian team [[U.C. Sampdoria|Sampdoria]] in the First Round, which have [[Antonio Cassano]] and [[Vincenzo Montella]] as notable players, made the task seem impossible. Aalborg made it again on the away goal rule (getting 2\u20132 in [[Genoa]] and managing 0\u20130 in [[Aalborg]]), and qualified for the group stage&nbsp;\u2013 being the first Danish team ever, to send an Italian team \"out of Europe.\" In the group stage Aalborg BK was seeded in the lowest pot, and drew [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]], [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], [[Getafe CF|Getafe]], and [[Hapoel Tel Aviv F.C.|Hapoel Tel Aviv]]. Drawing with Anderlecht at home, and losing 2\u20133 to Tottenham (after being ahead 2\u20130 after the first half) forced Aalborg to win at home against Getafe, a match Aalborg BK lost 1\u20132.\n\nIn the 2007\u201308 season, Aalborg won their third Danish Championship and qualified for the [[2008\u201309 UEFA Champions League]] qualifying rounds. in the second qualifying round, Aalborg easily eliminated [[FK Modri\u010da]] 7\u20131 on aggregate. In the third round, before the group stage, they defeated [[FBK Kaunas]] 2\u20130 both at home and away and reached the group stage of the Champions League for the second time, the first time a Danish team achieved this. In the group stage, they were drawn in Group E along with defending champions [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], [[Villarreal CF|Villarreal]] and [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]].  Aalborg finished third in the group, ahead of Celtic, with 6 points and progressed to the [[2008\u201309 UEFA Cup]] knockout stage.\n\nTheir first match in their UEFA Cup run was against Spanish side [[Deportivo de La Coru\u00f1a]]. Aalborg BK won the first leg at home 3\u20130 and the second leg at the [[Estadio Riazor]] 1\u20133, securing a 6\u20131 aggregate. Aalborg BK thereby earned a place among the last 16 teams. where they faced [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]. After a 2\u20130 loss in [[Manchester]] in the first leg Aalborg BK fought back to tie the score with a 2\u20130 win at home. The tie ended in agony however, as Aalborg were defeated by 4\u20133 on penalties.\n\nOn 11 May 2014, the club won their 4th Danish Championship, and four days later [[Double (association football)|the double]] was secured, as the club defeated [[F.C. Copenhagen]] 4\u20132 in the Cup final.\n\n==Stadium==\n{{Main|Nordjyske Arena}}\n[[File:Aalborg Stadion.jpg|thumbnail|right|The northern facade of Nordjyske Arena, 2008.]]\nSince 1920, Aalborg BK has played its games at Aalborg Stadion. The stadium was opened on 18 July 1920 with a north-south aligned playing field. The first spectator seats was built in 1927, and in 1937 a wooden terrace for 3,000 standing spectators was built.
