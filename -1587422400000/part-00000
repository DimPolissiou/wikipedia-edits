He referred to mime as the \"art of silence\" and he performed professionally worldwide for over 60 years. As a youth, he lived in hiding and worked with the [[French Resistance]] during most of World War II, giving his first major performance to 3,000 troops after the [[liberation of Paris]] in August 1944.<ref name=IMDB/> Following the war, he studied dramatic art and mime in Paris.\n\nIn 1959, he established his own [[pantomime]] school in Paris, and subsequently set up the Marceau Foundation to promote the art in the U.S. Among his various awards and honours he was made \"Grand Officier de la L\u00e9gion d'Honneur\" (1998) and was awarded the [[National Order of Merit (France)|National Order of Merit]] (1998) in France. He won the [[Emmy Award]] for his work on television, was elected member of the Academy of Fine Arts in Berlin and was declared a \"National treasure\" in Japan.<ref name=IMDB/> He was friends with [[Michael Jackson]] for nearly 20 years and Jackson said he used some of Marceau's techniques in his own dance steps.<ref name=Jet/>\n\n== Early years ==\n\nMarcel Marceau was born  in [[Strasbourg]], France, to a [[Jew]]ish family. His father, Charles Mangel, was a [[kosher]] butcher originally from [[B\u0119dzin]], Poland. His mother, Anne Werzberg, came from [[Yabluniv]], present-day Ukraine. Through his mother's family, he is a cousin of Israeli singer [[Yardena Arazi]]. When Marcel was four years old, the family moved to [[Lille]], but they later returned to Strasbourg.<ref name=IMDB/>\n\nAfter France's [[France during the Second World War|invasion by Nazi Germany]], Marcel, 16, fled with his family to [[Limoges]]. His cousin [[Georges Loinger]], one of the members of the French Jewish Resistance in France (Organisation Juive de Combat-OJC), urged him to join the French Jewish Resistance in France in the rescue of Jews during the Holocaust. The OJC, which was composed of nine clandestine Jewish networks,  rescued thousands of children and adults during the Holocaust in France.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jcpa.org/article/the-jewish-resistance-in-france-during-world-war-ii-the-gap-between-history-and-memory/|title=The Jewish Resistance in France During World War II: the gap between History and Memory|last=Hershco|first=Tsilla|date=Jewish Political Studies Review 19:1\u20132 (Spring 2007)|website=JCPA.org|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>   \n\nHe was schooled in the Paris suburbs at the home of [[Yvonne Hagnauer]], while pretending to be a worker at the school she directed; Hagnauer would later receive the honor of [[Righteous Among the Nations]] from [[Yad Vashem]].

The first time he used mime was after France was invaded, in order to keep Jewish children quiet while he helped them escape to neutral Switzerland.<ref name=IMDB>[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0545131/bio \"Marcel Marceau\" biography] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160207125741/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0545131/bio |date=7 February 2016 }}, IMDB</ref><ref name=\"smh\">{{cite news | first=Steve | last=Meacham | title=How mayonnaise sandwiches saved kids from Nazis | url= http://www.theage.com.au/world/how-mayonnaise-sandwiches-saved-kids-from-nazis-20091128-jxwq.html | newspaper=The Age | publisher=Fairfax | date = 29 November 2009}}</ref>\n\nAfter the war ended in 1945, he enrolled as a student in [[Charles Dullin]]'s School of Dramatic Art in the [[Sarah Bernhardt]] Theatre in Paris, where he studied with teachers such as Joshua Smith and [[\u00c9tienne Decroux]] and [[Jean-Louis Barrault]].<ref name=IMDB/>\n\n== Career ==\n\nMarceau joined Jean-Louis Barrault's company and was soon cast in the role of [[Harlequin|Arlequin]] in the pantomime, ''Baptiste'' (which Barrault had interpreted in the film ''[[Children of Paradise|Les Enfants du Paradis]]'').<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080516103005/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22474160-16947,00.html \"Master of Mime passes away\"], ''The Australian''. {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Marceau's performance won him such acclaim that he was encouraged to present his first \"mimodrama\", ''Praxitele and the Golden Fish'', at the Bernhardt Theatre that same year. The acclaim was unanimous and Marceau's career as a mime was firmly established.\n\n[[File:Marcel Marceau - 1974.jpg|thumb|left|Marceau as Bip the Clown in 1974]]\nIn 1947 Marceau created Bip the Clown, whom he first played at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Poche (Pocket Theatre) in Paris. In his appearance he wore a striped pullover and a battered, be-flowered silk opera hat. The outfit signified life's fragility and Bip became his alter ego, just as the \"[[The Tramp|Little Tramp]]\" had become [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s. Bip's misadventures with everything from butterflies to lions, from ships and trains to dance-halls and restaurants, were limitless. As a stylist of pantomime, Marceau was acknowledged without peer. Marceau, during a televised talk with Todd Farley, expresses his respect for the mime techniques that Charlie Chaplin used in his films, noting that Chaplin seemed to be the only silent film actor who used mime.<ref>{{YouTube|8hlNITTKxC4|\"Marcel Marceau with Todd Farley Part 9: Charlie Chaplin\"}}, 11-part video</ref>\n\nHis silent mimed exercises, which included ''The Cage'', ''Walking Against the Wind'', ''The Mask Maker'', and ''In The Park'', all became classic displays. Satires on everything from sculptors to matadors were described as works of genius. Of his summation of the ages of man in the famous ''Youth, Maturity, Old Age and Death'', one critic said: \"He accomplishes in less than two minutes what most novelists cannot do in volumes.\" During an interview with CBS in 1987, Marceau tried to explain some of his inner feelings while creating mime, calling it the \"art of silence:\"\n\n{{quote|The art of silence speaks to the soul, like music, making comedy, tragedy, and romance, involving ''you'' and your life. . . . creating character and space, by making a whole show on stage \u2013 showing our lives, our dreams, our expectations.<ref>{{YouTube|QbxNWmH6CAo|\"Marcel Marceau Remembered\"}} ''CBS Sunday Morning'', 25 September 2007</ref>}}\n\nIn 1949, following his receipt of the [[Deburau Prize]] (established as a memorial to the 19th century mime master [[Jean-Gaspard Deburau]]) for his second mimodrama, ''Death before Dawn'', Marceau founded Compagnie de Mime Marcel Marceau, the only company of pantomime in the world at the time. The ensemble played the leading Paris theaters, such as Le [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]], Le Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Renaissance, and the Bernhardt Theatre, as well as other playhouses throughout the world.\n\nFrom 1959 to 1960, a retrospective of his mimodramas, including ''[[The Overcoat]]'' by [[Gogol]], ran for a full year at the Amibigu Theatre in Paris. He produced 15 other mimodramas, including ''Pierrot de Montmartre'', ''The Three Wigs'', ''The Pawn Shop'', ''14 July'', ''The Wolf of Tsu Ku Mi'', ''Paris Cries\u2014Paris Laughs'' and ''Don Juan'' (adapted from the Spanish writer [[Tirso de Molina]]).\n\n=== World recognition ===\n\n[[File:Marcel Marceau - AP 1974.jpg|thumb|Marceau in 1974]]\nMarceau performed all over the world in order to spread the \"art of silence\" (''L'art du silence''). It was the intellectual minority who knew of him until he first toured the United States in 1955 and 1956, close on the heels of his North American debut at the [[Stratford Festival of Canada]]. After his opening engagement at the Phoenix Theater in New York, which received rave reviews, he moved to the larger [[Ethel Barrymore Theatre|Barrymore Theater]] to accommodate the public demand. This first US tour ended with a record-breaking return to standing-room-only crowds in San Francisco, Chicago, Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, Los Angeles, and other major cities. His extensive transcontinental tours included South America, Africa, Australia, China, Japan, South East Asia, Taiwan, Russia, and Europe. His last world tour covered the United States in 2004, and returned to Europe in 2005 and Australia in 2006. He was one of the world's most renowned mimes.\nMarceau's art became familiar to millions through his many television appearances. His first television performance as a star performer on the Max Liebman, [[Mike Douglas]] and [[Dinah Shore]], and he also had his own one-man show entitled \"Meet Marcel Marceau\". He teamed with [[Red Skelton]] in three concerts of pantomimes.\n\nMarceau also showed his versatility in motion pictures such as Professor Ping in ''[[Barbarella (film)|Barbarella]]'' (1968); ''First Class'' (1970), in which he played 17 roles; ''[[Shanks (film)|Shanks]]'' (1974), where he combined his silent art, playing a deaf and mute puppeteer, and his speaking talent, as a mad scientist; and a cameo as himself in [[Mel Brooks]]\n''[[Silent Movie]]'' (1976), in which, with intentional irony, his character has the only audible speaking part, uttering the single word \"No!\" when Brooks asks him (via [[intertitle]]) if he would participate in the film. His last film appearances included small roles in [[Klaus Kinski]]'s ''[[Paganini (1989 film)|Paganini]]'' (1989) and ''[[Joseph's Gift]]'' (1998). He also had a role in a low-budget film roughly based on his life story called ''Paint It White''. The film was never completed because another actor in the movie, a lifelong friend{{who|date=November 2010}} with whom he had attended school, died halfway through filming.\n\n[[File:Marcel Marceau (1962).jpg|thumb|left|Marceau in 1962]]\nAs an author, Marceau published two books for children, the ''Marcel Marceau Alphabet Book'' and the ''Marcel Marceau Counting Book'', and poetry and illustrations, including ''La ballade de Paris et du Monde'' (''The Ballad of Paris and of the World''), an art book which he wrote in 1966, and ''The Story of Bip'', written and illustrated by Marceau and published by Harper and Row. In 1974, he posed for artist Kenneth Hari and worked on paintings and drawings that resulted in a book, and the art work in many museum collections. In 1982, ''Le Troisi\u00e8me \u0152il'', (''The Third Eye''), his collection of ten original lithographs, was published in Paris with an accompanying text by Marceau. Belfond of Paris published ''Pimporello'' in 1987. In 2001, a new photo book for children titled ''Bip in a Book'', published by Stewart, Tabori & Chang, appeared in the bookstores in the US, France and Australia.\n\nIn 1969, Marcel Marceau opened his first school, \u00c9cole Internationale de Mime, in the Th\u00e9\u00e0tre de la Musique in Paris. The school was open for two years with fencing, acrobatics, ballet and five teachers of Mime.\n\nIn 1978, Marceau established his own school, \u00c9cole Internationale de Mimodrame de Paris, Marcel Marceau (International School of Mimodrame of Paris, Marcel Marceau).\nIn 1996, he established the Marceau Foundation to promote mime in the United States.\n\nIn 1995, pop megastar [[Michael Jackson]], who had been friends with Marceau for nearly 20 years, planned a concert together with him for [[HBO]], but the concert was cancelled after Jackson was hospitalised for exhaustion during rehearsals. Jackson, during an interview, said that he had always been \"in awe\" at Marceau's skill as a performer:\n{{quote|He was a great guy.

From 1999, when Marceau returned with his classic solo show to New York and San Francisco after 15-year absences for critically acclaimed sold-out runs, his career in America enjoyed a remarkable renaissance with strong appeal to a third generation. He latterly appeared to overwhelming acclaim for extended engagements at such legendary American theaters as The [[Ford's Theatre]] in Washington, D.C., the [[American Repertory Theater]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], Massachusetts, and the Geffen Playhouse in Los Angeles, demonstrating the timeless appeal of the work and the mastery of this unique artist.\n\nMarceau's new full company production ''Les Contes Fantastiques'' (''Fantasy Tales'') opened to great acclaim at the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Antoine]] in Paris.\n\n== Personal life ==\n\n[[Image:Marcel Marceau in Dresden 2004.jpg|thumb|200px|Marceau in 2004]]\nMarceau was married three times: first to Huguette Mallet, with whom he had two sons, Michel and Baptiste; then, to Ella Jaroszewicz, with whom he had no children.

He referred to mime as the \"art of silence\" and he performed professionally worldwide for over 60 years. As a youth, he lived in hiding and worked with the [[French Resistance]] during most of World War II, giving his first major performance to 3,000 troops after the [[liberation of Paris]] in August 1944.<ref name=IMDB/> Following the war, he studied dramatic art and mime in Paris.\n\nIn 1959, he established his own [[pantomime]] school in Paris, and subsequently set up the Marceau Foundation to promote the art in the U.S. Among his various awards and honours he was made \"Grand Officier de la L\u00e9gion d'Honneur\" (1998) and was awarded the [[National Order of Merit (France)|National Order of Merit]] (1998) in France.

His father, Charles Mangel, was a [[kosher]] butcher originally from [[B\u0119dzin]], Poland. His mother, Anne Werzberg, came from [[Yabluniv]], present-day Ukraine. Through his mother's family, he is a cousin of Israeli singer [[Yardena Arazi]]. When Marcel was four years old, the family moved to [[Lille]], but they later returned to Strasbourg.<ref name=IMDB/>\n\nAfter France's [[France during the Second World War|invasion by Nazi Germany]], Marcel, 16, fled with his family to [[Limoges]]. His cousin [[Georges Loinger]], one of the members of the French Jewish Resistance in France (Organisation Juive de Combat-OJC), urged him to join the French Jewish Resistance in France in the rescue of Jews during the Holocaust. The OJC, which was composed of nine clandestine Jewish networks,  rescued thousands of children and adults during the Holocaust in France.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jcpa.org/article/the-jewish-resistance-in-france-during-world-war-ii-the-gap-between-history-and-memory/|title=The Jewish Resistance in France During World War II: the gap between History and Memory|last=Hershco|first=Tsilla|date=Jewish Political Studies Review 19:1-2 (Spring 2007)|website=JCPA.org|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>   \n\nHe was schooled in the Paris suburbs at the home of [[Yvonne Hagnauer]], while pretending to be a worker at the school she directed; Hagnauer would later receive the honor of [[Righteous Among the Nations]] from [[Yad Vashem]].

The acclaim was unanimous and Marceau's career as a mime was firmly established.\n\n[[File:Marcel Marceau - 1974.jpg|thumb|left|Marceau as Bip the Clown in 1974]]\nIn 1947 Marceau created Bip the Clown, whom he first played at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Poche (Pocket Theatre) in Paris. In his appearance he wore a striped pullover and a battered, be-flowered silk opera hat. The outfit signified life's fragility and Bip became his alter ego, just as the \"[[The Tramp|Little Tramp]]\" had become [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s. Bip's misadventures with everything from butterflies to lions, from ships and trains to dance-halls and restaurants, were limitless. As a stylist of pantomime, Marceau was acknowledged without peer. Marceau, during a televised talk with Todd Farley, expresses his respect for the mime techniques that Charlie Chaplin used in his films, noting that Chaplin seemed to be the only silent film actor who used mime.<ref>{{YouTube|8hlNITTKxC4|\"Marcel Marceau with Todd Farley Part 9: Charlie Chaplin\"}}, 11-part video</ref>\n\nHis silent mimed exercises, which included ''The Cage'', ''Walking Against the Wind'', ''The Mask Maker'', and ''In The Park'', all became classic displays. Satires on everything from sculptors to matadors were described as works of genius. Of his summation of the ages of man in the famous ''Youth, Maturity, Old Age and Death'', one critic said: \"He accomplishes in less than two minutes what most novelists cannot do in volumes.\" During an interview with CBS in 1987, Marceau tried to explain some of his inner feelings while creating mime, calling it the \"art of silence:\"\n\n{{quote|The art of silence speaks to the soul, like music, making comedy, tragedy, and romance, involving ''you'' and your life. . . . creating character and space, by making a whole show on stage \u2013 showing our lives, our dreams, our expectations.<ref>{{YouTube|QbxNWmH6CAo|\"Marcel Marceau Remembered\"}} ''CBS Sunday Morning'', 25 September 2007</ref>}}\n\nIn 1949, following his receipt of the [[Deburau Prize]] (established as a memorial to the 19th century mime master [[Jean-Gaspard Deburau]]) for his second mimodrama, ''Death before Dawn'', Marceau founded Compagnie de Mime Marcel Marceau, the only company of pantomime in the world at the time. The ensemble played the leading Paris theaters, such as Le [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]], Le Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Renaissance, and the Bernhardt Theatre, as well as other playhouses throughout the world.\n\nFrom 1959 to 1960, a retrospective of his mimodramas, including ''[[The Overcoat]]'' by [[Gogol]], ran for a full year at the Amibigu Theatre in Paris. He produced 15 other mimodramas, including ''Pierrot de Montmartre'', ''The Three Wigs'', ''The Pawn Shop'', ''14 July'', ''The Wolf of Tsu Ku Mi'', ''Paris Cries\u2014Paris Laughs'' and ''Don Juan'' (adapted from the Spanish writer [[Tirso de Molina]]).\n\n=== World recognition ===\n\n[[File:Marcel Marceau - AP 1974.jpg|thumb|Marceau in 1974]]\nMarceau performed all over the world in order to spread the \"art of silence\" (''L'art du silence''). It was the intellectual minority who knew of him until he first toured the United States in 1955 and 1956, close on the heels of his North American debut at the [[Stratford Festival of Canada]]. After his opening engagement at the Phoenix Theater in New York, which received rave reviews, he moved to the larger [[Ethel Barrymore Theatre|Barrymore Theater]] to accommodate the public demand. This first US tour ended with a record-breaking return to standing-room-only crowds in San Francisco, Chicago, Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, Los Angeles, and other major cities. His extensive transcontinental tours included South America, Africa, Australia, China, Japan, South East Asia, Taiwan, Russia, and Europe. His last world tour covered the United States in 2004, and returned to Europe in 2005 and Australia in 2006. He was one of the world's most renowned mimes.\nMarceau's art became familiar to millions through his many television appearances. His first television performance as a star performer on the Max Liebman, [[Mike Douglas]] and [[Dinah Shore]], and he also had his own one-man show entitled \"Meet Marcel Marceau\". He teamed with [[Red Skelton]] in three concerts of pantomimes.\n\nMarceau also showed his versatility in motion pictures such as Professor Ping in ''[[Barbarella (film)|Barbarella]]'' (1968); ''First Class'' (1970), in which he played 17 roles; ''[[Shanks (film)|Shanks]]'' (1974), where he combined his silent art, playing a deaf and mute puppeteer, and his speaking talent, as a mad scientist; and a cameo as himself in [[Mel Brooks]]\n''[[Silent Movie]]'' (1976), in which, with intentional irony, his character has the only audible speaking part, uttering the single word \"No!\" when Brooks asks him (via [[intertitle]]) if he would participate in the film. His last film appearances included small roles in [[Klaus Kinski]]'s ''[[Paganini (1989 film)|Paganini]]'' (1989) and ''[[Joseph's Gift]]'' (1998). He also had a role in a low-budget film roughly based on his life story called ''Paint It White''. The film was never completed because another actor in the movie, a lifelong friend{{who|date=November 2010}} with whom he had attended school, died halfway through filming.\n\n[[File:Marcel Marceau (1962).jpg|thumb|left|Marceau in 1962]]\nAs an author, Marceau published two books for children, the ''Marcel Marceau Alphabet Book'' and the ''Marcel Marceau Counting Book'', and poetry and illustrations, including ''La ballade de Paris et du Monde'' (''The Ballad of Paris and of the World''), an art book which he wrote in 1966, and ''The Story of Bip'', written and illustrated by Marceau and published by Harper and Row. In 1974, he posed for artist Kenneth Hari and worked on paintings and drawings that resulted in a book, and the art work in many museum collections. In 1982, ''Le Troisi\u00e8me \u0152il'', (''The Third Eye''), his collection of ten original lithographs, was published in Paris with an accompanying text by Marceau. Belfond of Paris published ''Pimporello'' in 1987. In 2001, a new photo book for children titled ''Bip in a Book'', published by Stewart, Tabori & Chang, appeared in the bookstores in the US, France and Australia.\n\nIn 1969, Marcel Marceau opened his first school, \u00c9cole Internationale de Mime, in the Th\u00e9\u00e0tre de la Musique in Paris. The school was open for two years with fencing, acrobatics, ballet and five teachers of Mime.\n\nIn 1978, Marceau established his own school, \u00c9cole Internationale de Mimodrame de Paris, Marcel Marceau (International School of Mimodrame of Paris, Marcel Marceau).\nIn 1996, he established the Marceau Foundation to promote mime in the United States.\n\nIn 1995, pop megastar [[Michael Jackson]], who had been friends with Marceau for nearly 20 years, planned a concert together with him for [[HBO]], but the concert was cancelled after Jackson was hospitalised for exhaustion during rehearsals. Jackson, during an interview, said that he had always been \"in awe\" at Marceau's skill as a performer:\n{{quote|He was a great guy. I used to go see Marcel Marceau all of the time, before [[Off the Wall (album)|''Off the Wall'']]. I used to sneak in and sit in the audience and watch how he would defy the laws of gravity, like he was stepping on air. I would take some of those things and include it into rhythm and dance when I move.<ref name=Jet>\"Michael Jackson Breaks Silence, Remembers Mime Marcel Marceau\", ''Jet'', Oct. 15, 2007 p. 32</ref><ref>{{YouTube|-PMDYjD21E0|Michael Jackson and Marcel Marceau on stage for HBO}}, video</ref>}}\n\nIn 2000, Marceau brought his full mime company to New York City for presentation of his new mimodrama, ''The Bowler Hat'', previously seen in Paris, London, Tokyo, Taipei, Caracas, Santo Domingo, Valencia (Venezuela) and Munich. From 1999, when Marceau returned with his classic solo show to New York and San Francisco after 15-year absences for critically acclaimed sold-out runs, his career in America enjoyed a remarkable renaissance with strong appeal to a third generation. He latterly appeared to overwhelming acclaim for extended engagements at such legendary American theaters as The [[Ford's Theatre]] in Washington, D.C., the [[American Repertory Theater]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], Massachusetts, and the Geffen Playhouse in Los Angeles, demonstrating the timeless appeal of the work and the mastery of this unique artist.\n\nMarceau's new full company production ''Les Contes Fantastiques'' (''Fantasy Tales'') opened to great acclaim at the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Antoine]] in Paris.\n\n== Personal life ==\n\n[[Image:Marcel Marceau in Dresden 2004.jpg|thumb|200px|Marceau in 2004]]\nMarceau was married three times: first to Huguette Mallet, with whom he had two sons, Michel and Baptiste; then, to Ella Jaroszewicz, with whom he had no children. His third wife was Anne Sicco, with whom he had two daughters, Camille and Aur\u00e9lia.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/24/arts/24marceau.html?_r=1&ref=arts&oref=slogin \"Marcel Marceau, Renowned Mime, Dies at 84\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017005032/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/24/arts/24marceau.html?_r=1&ref=arts&oref=slogin |date=17 October 2015 }}, ''The New York Times'', 24 September 2007.</ref>\n\nArtist and fellow mime [[Paulette Frankl]] released a memoir in August 2014 about her decades-long relationship with Marceau, ''Marcel & Me: A Memoir of Love, Lust, and Illusion'', released in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfreporter.com/santafe/article-8323-mime-body-spirit.html|title=Mime, Body, Spirit|author=|date=|work=sfreporter.com}}</ref>\n\n== Death ==\n\nMarceau died in a retirement home in [[Cahors]], France, on 22 September 2007 at the age of 84. At his burial ceremony, the second movement of Mozart's [[Piano Concerto No. 21 (Mozart)|Piano Concerto No. 21]] (which Marceau long used as an accompaniment for an elegant mime routine) was played, as was the [[sarabande]] of Bach's [[BWV 1011|Cello Suite No. 5]].

Atop the cliffs, the Island's county flower, the [[pyramidal orchid]], can be found, while the rare [[Glanville fritillary]] butterfly also lives in large numbers supported by the native flowers. There are also other hardy plants, such as [[Ulex europaeus|common gorse]] bushes and [[wild cabbage]].\n\nThe bay is popular with [[Surfing|wave]] and [[kitesurfing|kite surfers]] due to the waves that form when the prevailing south-westerly wind is blowing onshore. The beach is gently shelving and consists mostly of sand, with a few lengths of submerged rock, although at high tide the sea covers the beach almost completely. The car park and its public facilities are owned by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]], as is the coastal strip of land.

In the men's team all-around final, Uchimura anchored the Japanese team to win the gold medal with a score of 274.094, reclaiming the title for [[Japan]] for the first time since the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] in [[Athens]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Fincher|first1=Julia|title=Kohei Uchimura and Japanese men claim gold in gymnastics team final|url=http://www.nbcolympics.com/news/kohei-uchimura-and-japanese-men-claim-gold-gymnastics-team-final|accessdate=August 9, 2016|publisher=NBC Olympics|date=August 8, 2016}}</ref>\n\nTwo days after the team final, Uchimura defended his individual all-around gold medal with a score of 92.365, becoming the first gymnast in 44 years to win back-to-back individual all-around golds on the Olympic stage.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Fincher|first1=Julia|title=\"King Kohei\" Uchimura wins second consecutive all-around title|url=http://www.nbcolympics.com/news/long-may-he-reign-king-kohei-uchimura-wins-second-consecutive-all-around-title|accessdate=August 11, 2016|publisher=NBC Olympics|date=August 10, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===2017===\nAt the [[2017 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships]] in [[Montreal]], his world all-around champion streak that began in 2009 came to an end when he injured his ankle on his vault landing in qualification, forcing him to withdraw.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://olympics.nbcsports.com/2017/10/02/kohei-uchimura-injury-gymnastics-world-championships/|title=Kohei Uchimura pulls out of world all-around, record streak ends|last=Zaccardi|first=Nick|date=2017-10-03|website=OlympicTalk|language=en|access-date=2019-05-04}}</ref>\n\nThis led to his long win-streak at worlds and Olympics being unexpectedly broken for the only time since he started by winning the first of his six World Championships all-around title to begin that quad in 2009 and continued over two complete Olympic cycles (approximately 8 years) ending with him winning his second Olympic all-around title in 2016. This was also the first time in 9 years since before 2008 that he had not medalled, namely silver and/or gold medals, at one of the [[International Gymnastics Federation|FIG]]'s major competitions\u2014the Olympics or World Championships.\n\n===2018===\nBetween October 25 and November 3, 2018, Uchimura competed at the [[2018 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships]] in [[Doha]] but on a reduced schedule. During the team event final, he had helped team [[Japan]] secure the bronze medal behind team champion [[China]] and runner-up [[Russia]] by contributing scores to four apparatuses: pommel horse (14.133), rings (14.200), parallel bars (14.500) and high bar (14.400). Uchimura also qualified for the individual event final on the horizontal bar, winning the silver medal with a score of 14.800 behind 2012 Olympic high bar champion, [[Epke Zonderland]] of the [[Netherlands]], who scored a 15.100.\n\n==Competitive history==\n\nUchimura has won at least one medal in every world championships and Olympic Games since 2008 except in 2017 where he injured his left ankle after only finishing 3 out of 6 routines in the individual all-around qualifier at the [[2017 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2017 World Championships]], which abruptly ended his 8-year win streak in a two-full-Olympic-cycle reign as world and Olympic champion, and \"withdrew\" (WD) from the event. In his 2018 return, Uchimura had yet to fully regain his previous top form and winning ways in terms of fitness level and preparation. Also, his results at the [[2018 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2018 World Championships]] reflected that as he competed a reduced schedule, and in only one individual event final, he did however contribute several routines to team [[Japan]]'s final score, which won him bronze in team and silver in individual horizontal bar event finals. However, Uchimura's Olympic winning streak was similarly uncertain due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], which caused postponement of the Games for a year.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n! width=7% class=unsortable| Year\n! width=37% class=unsortable| Event\n! width=7% class=unsortable| Team\n! width=7% class=unsortable| All-Around\n! width=7% class=unsortable|[[Gymnastics floor|Floor Exercise]]\n! width=7% class=unsortable|[[Pommel horse|Pommel Horse]]\n! width=7% class=unsortable|[[Gymnastics rings|Still Rings]]\n! width=7% class=unsortable|[[Gymnastics vault|Vault]]\n! width=7% class=unsortable|[[Gymnastics parallel bars|Parallel Bars]]\n! width=7% class=unsortable|[[Horizontal bar|Horizontal Bar]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\" align=center|'''2007'''|| align=left|[[2007 Summer Universiade|Summer Universiade]] || {{goca}} || || {{goca}} || || || {{brca}} || || \n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\" align=center|'''2008'''|| align=left|[[2008 Artistic Gymnastics World Cup Final|World Cup Final]] || {{N/A}} || {{N/A}} || {{sica}} || || || || ||\n|-bgcolor=98FB98\n|align=left |'''[[Gymnastics at the 2008 Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]]''' || {{sica}} || {{sica}} || || || || || ||\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\" align=center|'''2009'''\n|-bgcolor=#CCCCFF\n|align=left|[[2009 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|World Championships]] || {{N/A}} || {{goca}} || 4 || || || || || 6\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\" align=center|'''2010'''\n|-bgcolor=#CCCCFF\n|align=left|[[2010 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|World Championships]] || {{sica}} || {{goca}} || {{sica}} || || || || {{brca}} ||\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\" align=center|'''2011'''\n|-bgcolor=#CCCCFF\n|align=left|[[2011 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|World Championships]] || {{sica}} || {{goca}} || {{goca}} || 5 || 6 || || 4 || {{brca}}\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\" align=center|'''2012'''\n|-bgcolor=98FB98\n|align=left|'''[[Gymnastics at the 2012 Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]]''' || {{sica}} || {{goca}} || {{sica}} || || || || DNC ||\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\" align=center|'''2013'''\n|-bgcolor=#CCCCFF\n|align=left|[[2013 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|World Championships]] || {{N/A}} || {{goca}} || {{brca}} || || || || {{goca}} || {{brca}}\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\" align=center|'''[[2014 in artistic gymnastics|2014]]'''\n|-bgcolor=#CCCCFF\n|align=left|[[2014 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|World Championships]] || {{sica}} || {{goca}} || || || || || || {{sica}}\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\" align=center|'''[[2015 in artistic gymnastics|2015]]'''\n|-bgcolor=#CCCCFF\n|align=left|[[2015 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|World Championships]] || {{goca}} || {{goca}} || || || || || || {{goca}}\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\" align=center|'''[[2016 in artistic gymnastics|2016]]'''\n|-bgcolor=98FB98\n|align=left|'''[[Gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]]''' || {{goca}} || {{goca}} || 5 || || || || R1 ||\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\" align=center|'''[[2017 in artistic gymnastics|2017]]'''\n|-bgcolor=#CCCCFF\n|align=left|[[2017 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|World Championships]] || {{N/A}} || WD || || || || || ||\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\" align=center|'''[[2018 in artistic gymnastics|2018]]'''\n|-bgcolor=#CCCCFF\n|align=left|[[2018 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|World Championships]] || {{brca}} || || || || || || || {{sica}}\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\" align=center|'''[[2019 in artistic gymnastics|2019]]'''\n|-bgcolor=#CCCCFF\n| align=left|[[2019 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|World Championships]] ||colspan=9; rowspan=1; align=center | Did not qualify due to injury\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\" align=center|'''[[2020 in artistic gymnastics|2020]]'''\n|-bgcolor=98FB98\n| align=left|'''Olympic Games''' ||colspan=9; rowspan=1; align=center | Did not proceed due to coronavirus\n|}\n\nAt the [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Olympics]] in [[London]], Uchimura's score should have qualified him for the individual parallel bars event final in fifth place, but he \"did not compete\" (DNC) in the final due to the strict \u201ctwo per country\u201d rule for individual event finals.
