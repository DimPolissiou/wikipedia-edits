Located in [[Lake Scott State Park]], the remains of the stone and adobe pueblo are situated north of [[Scott City, Kansas]], on [[Ladder Creek]].\n\n==Origins==\nThe origin of El Quartelejo has two likely possibilities. In 1664 a group of [[Pueblo Indians]] left [[New Mexico]] and were later rounded up and brought back by the Spanish. They may have constructed El Quartelejo. It is more likely that, after the collapse of the [[Pueblo Revolt]] (1680\u20131692), the Spanish reconquered New Mexican pueblos, and one group of [[Taos Pueblo|Taos]] and [[Picuris Pueblo|Picuris]] people fled the area in 1696. They searched for a new home among the [[Plains Apache]] on the [[Great Plains]]. \n\n== History ==\n\nFor ten years, the fleeing Taos and Picuris Pueblo people evaded the Spanish. During those years, the French attempted to trade with the Cuartelejo Apaches. In 1706 the Pueblos were captured and forced back to New Mexico. When the Pueblo Indians were seized, the Spanish commander [[Juan de Ulibarr\u00ed]] wrote that they were dwelling in permanent structures. The Spanish called this settlement El Quartelejo, and the region around it was called San Luis Province. No American Indians lived in El Quartelejo after 1706, but Spanish and French occasionally occupied the structure as a frontier outpost during the 18th century.  \n\nThe ill-fated, Spanish [[Villasur expedition]] of 1720 stopped at El Cuartelejo on its way north to investigate the extent of French influence. Near the forks of the [[Platte River]], the [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]]s and [[Otoe]]s killed most of the party, reportedly under French direction. \n\nBy the 1730s raids by Comanche, Ute, and Pawnee had decimated the Cuartelejo Apache. The survivors moved south to join the Jicarilla Apache at Pecos. However, after 1763 and the French retreat from the area, the pueblo was abandoned with only a mound and a few irrigation ditches remaining. Eventually, its walls decayed and the structure was buried by drifting soil.\n\n== Rediscovery ==\nThe pueblo was unknown to American explorers, but in 1898 archeologists rediscovered El Quartelejo. Since then, the site has been excavated to reveal that the pueblo was a seven-room structure, enough to house a small band of Indians.  Near the pueblo are traces of shallow ditches extending from the nearby springs. These ditches were most likely used to irrigate crops in nearby fields.\n\nNear here in 1878, Col. William H. Lewis, commanding troops from [[Fort Dodge (United States Army Post)|Fort Dodge]], was fatally wounded in a battle with chief Dull Knife and his Northern Cheyennes. Lewis was the last army officer killed by Indians in Kansas.\n\n== Preservation ==\nIn 1964, the El Quartelejo ruins were designated a [[National Historic Landmark]],<ref name=\"nhlsum\"/> and the area is now part of [[Lake Scott State Park]]. The Scott Lake site was developed in 1971 as an interpretive exhibit by Kansas Historical Society archeologists. The outline of the ruins was restored and markers placed for park visitors to see. Since 2004, the [[National Park Service]] has listed the El Quartelejo site as \"at risk\" because of ongoing weather-related deterioration to the ruins.\n\nEl Quartelejo Museum in Scott City is operated by the Scott County Historical Society.

In his work ''Art of Thought'', published in 1926, Wallas presented one of the first models of the creative process. In the Wallas stage model, creative insights and illuminations may be explained by a process consisting of 5 stages:\n:(i) ''[[Preparation (principle)|preparation]]'' (preparatory work on a problem that focuses the individual's mind on the problem and explores the problem's dimensions),\n:(ii) ''incubation'' (where the problem is internalized into the unconscious mind and nothing appears externally to be happening),\n:(iii) ''intimation'' (the creative person gets a \"feeling\" that a solution is on its way),\n:(iv) ''illumination'' or insight (where the creative idea bursts forth from its [[preconscious]] processing into conscious awareness);\n:(v) ''verification'' (where the idea is consciously verified, elaborated, and then applied).\nWallas' model is often treated as four stages, with \"intimation\" seen as a sub-stage.\n\nWallas considered creativity to be a legacy of the [[evolution]]ary process, which allowed humans to quickly adapt to rapidly changing environments.

Convergent thinking involves aiming for a single, correct solution to a problem, whereas divergent thinking involves creative generation of multiple answers to a set problem.

Other researchers have occasionally used the terms ''flexible'' thinking or [[fluid and crystallized intelligence|fluid intelligence]], which are roughly similar to (but not synonymous with) creativity.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2019|journal=Knowledge Cultures|volume=7|issue=2|pages=35|doi=10.22381/kc7220197|issn=2327-5731|title=The Relationship Between Individual Creativity Andcollective Intelligence in Modern Chinese Society}}</ref>\n\n=== Creative cognition approach ===\nIn 1992, Finke et al. proposed the \"Geneplore\" model, in which creativity takes place in two phases: a generative phase, where an individual constructs mental representations called preinventive structures, and an exploratory phase where those structures are used to come up with creative ideas. Some evidence shows that when people use their imagination to develop new ideas, those ideas are heavily structured in predictable ways by the properties of existing categories and concepts.<ref name=\"Ward1995\">Ward, T.B.

This new theory constitutes an attempt at providing a more unified explanation of relevant phenomena (in part by reinterpreting/integrating various fragmentary existing theories of [[Incubation (psychology)|incubation]] and [[insight]]).\n\nThe EII theory relies mainly on five basic principles, namely:\n# The co-existence of and the difference between explicit and implicit knowledge; \n# The simultaneous involvement of implicit and explicit processes in most tasks; \n# The redundant representation of explicit and implicit knowledge; \n# The integration of the results of explicit and implicit processing;\n# The iterative (and possibly bidirectional) processing. \nA computational implementation of the theory was developed based on the [[CLARION (cognitive architecture)|CLARION cognitive architecture]] and used to simulate relevant human data. This work represents an initial step in the development of process-based theories of creativity encompassing incubation, insight, and various other related phenomena.\n\n=== Conceptual blending ===\n{{Main|Conceptual blending}}\nIn ''[[The Act of Creation]]'', [[Arthur Koestler]] introduced the concept of ''bisociation'' \u2014 that creativity arises as a result of the intersection of two quite different frames of reference.<ref name=\"Koestler64\">{{cite book |author=Koestler, A. |title=The Act of Creation |year=1964 |authorlink=Arthur Koestler |isbn=978-0-330-73116-4 |publisher=Pan Books |location=London}}</ref> This idea was later developed into conceptual blending. In the 1990s, various approaches in cognitive science that dealt with [[metaphor]], [[analogy]], and [[structure mapping]] have been converging, and a new integrative approach to the study of creativity in science, art and humor has emerged under the label [[conceptual blending]].\n\n=== Honing theory ===\nHoning theory, developed principally by psychologist [[Liane Gabora]], posits that creativity arises due to the self-organizing, self-mending nature of a worldview. The creative process is a way in which the individual hones (and re-hones) an integrated worldview. Honing theory places emphasis not only on the externally visible creative outcome but also the internal cognitive restructuring and repair of the worldview brought about by the creative process. When faced with a creatively demanding task, there is an interaction between the conception of the task and the worldview. The conception of the task changes through interaction with the worldview, and the worldview changes through interaction with the task. This interaction is reiterated until the task is complete, at which point not only is the task conceived of differently, but the worldview is subtly or drastically transformed as it follows the natural tendency of a worldview to attempt to resolve dissonance and seek internal consistency amongst its components, whether they be ideas, attitudes, or bits of knowledge.\n\nA central feature of honing theory is the notion of a potentiality state.<ref>Gabora, L. & Saab, A. (2011). Creative interference and states of potentiality in analogy problem solving. ''Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society''. July 20\u201323, 2011, Boston MA.</ref> Honing theory posits that creative thought proceeds not by searching through and randomly \u2018mutating\u2019 predefined possibilities, but by drawing upon associations that exist due to overlap in the distributed neural cell assemblies that participate in the encoding of experiences in memory. Midway through the creative process one may have made associations between the current task and previous experiences, but not yet disambiguated which aspects of those previous experiences are relevant to the current task. Thus the creative idea may feel \u2018half-baked\u2019. It is at that point that it can be said to be in a potentiality state, because how it will actualize depends on the different internally or externally generated contexts it interacts with.\n\nHoning theory is held to explain certain phenomena not dealt with by other theories of creativity, for example, how different works by the same creator are observed in studies to exhibit a recognizable style or 'voice' even though in different creative outlets. This is not predicted by theories of creativity that emphasize chance processes or the accumulation of expertise, but it is predicted by honing theory, according to which personal style reflects the creator's uniquely structured worldview. Another example is in the environmental stimulus for creativity. Creativity is commonly considered to be fostered by a supportive, nurturing, trustworthy environment conducive to self-actualization. However, research shows that creativity is also associated with childhood adversity, which would stimulate honing.\n\n=== Everyday imaginative thought ===\nIn everyday thought, people often spontaneously imagine alternatives to reality when they think \"if only...\".<ref>Roese, N. J. & Olson, J. M. (1995). ''What Might Have Been: The Social Psychology of Counterfactual Thinking''. Mahwah, New Jersey: Erlbaum</ref> Their [[counterfactual thinking]] is viewed as an example of everyday creative processes.<ref>Markman, K. Klein, W. & Suhr, E. (eds) (2009).

It makes use of the results of divergent thinking tests (see below) by processing them further. It gives more weight to ideas that are radically different from other ideas in the response.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Snyder|first=Allan|date=2004|title=The creativity quotient: An objective scoring of ideational fluency|journal=Creativity Research Journal|volume=16|issue=4|pages=415\u2013419|doi=10.1080/10400410409534552}}</ref>\n\n=== Psychometric approach ===\n[[J. P. Guilford]]'s group,<ref name=\"Guilford67\" /> which pioneered the modern [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] study of creativity, constructed several tests to measure creativity in 1967:\n* Plot Titles, where participants are given the plot of a story and asked to write original titles.\n* Quick Responses is a word-association test scored for uncommonness.\n* Figure Concepts, where participants were given simple drawings of objects and individuals and asked to find qualities or features that are common by two or more drawings; these were scored for uncommonness.\n* Unusual Uses is finding unusual uses for common everyday objects such as bricks.\n* Remote Associations, where participants are asked to find a word between two given words (e.g. Hand _____ Call)\n* Remote Consequences, where participants are asked to generate a list of consequences of unexpected events (e.g. loss of gravity)\n\nOriginally, Guilford was trying to create a model for intellect as a whole, but in doing so also created a model for creativity. Guilford made an important assumption for creative research: creativity isn't one abstract concept. \u00a0The idea that creativity is a category rather than one single concept opened up the ability for other researchers to look at creativity with a whole new perspective.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite journal|last=Sternberg|first=Robert J.|last2=Grigorenko|first2=Elena L.|date=8 June 2010|title=Guilford's Structure of Intellect Model and Model of Creativity: Contributions and Limitations|journal= Creativity Research Journal|volume=13|issue=3\u20134|pages=309\u2013316|doi=10.1207/s15326934crj1334_08|issn=1040-0419}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Guilford|first=J.

Like under/low-valued stock, creative individuals generate unique ideas that are initially rejected by other people. The creative individual has to persevere, and convince the others of the ideas value. After convincing the others, and thus increasing the ideas value, the creative individual \u2018sells high\u2019 by leaving the idea with the other people, and moves onto generating another idea. According to this theory, six distinct, but related elements contribute to successful creativity: intelligence, knowledge, thinking styles, personality, motivation, and environment. Intelligence is just one of the six factors that can either solely, or in conjunction with the other five factors, generate creative thoughts.\n*Amabile's Componential Model of Creativity.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Amabile | first1 = T.

The researchers make use of the metaphor of the amusement park to demonstrate that within each of these creative levels, intelligence plays a key role:\n**To get into the amusement park, there are initial requirements (e.g., time/transport to go to the park). Initial requirements (like intelligence) are necessary, but not sufficient for creativity. They are more like prerequisites for creativity, and if an individual does not possess the basic level of the initial requirement (intelligence), then they will not be able to generate creative thoughts/behaviour.\n**Secondly are the subcomponents \u2013 general thematic areas \u2013 that increase in specificity. Like choosing which type of amusement park to visit (e.g. a zoo or a water park), these areas relate to the areas in which someone could be creative (e.g. poetry).\n**Thirdly, there are specific domains. After choosing the type of park to visit e.g. waterpark, you then have to choose which specific park to go to. Within the poetry domain, there are many different types (e.g. free verse, riddles, sonnet, etc.) that have to be selected from.\n**Lastly, there are micro-domains. These are the specific tasks that reside within each domain e.g. individual lines in a free verse poem / individual rides at the waterpark.\n\n=== Creativity and intelligence as overlapping yet distinct constructs ===\nThis possible relationship concerns creativity and intelligence as distinct, but intersecting constructs.\n\n''Theories that include Creativity and Intelligence as Overlapping Yet Distinct Constructs''\n\n*Renzulli's Three-Ring Conception of Giftedness.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Renzulli | first1 = J.

Thus, creativity and Intelligence (problem solving) are the same thing. Perkins<ref>Perkins, D. N. (1981) The mind\u2019s best work.

The problem can only be solved if the lines go outside the boundaries of the square of dots. Results demonstrated that even when participants were given this insight, they still found it difficult to solve the problem, thus showing that to successfully complete the task it is not just insight (or creativity) that is required.\n\n=== Creativity and intelligence as disjoint sets ===\nIn this view, creativity and intelligence are completely different, unrelated constructs.\n\nGetzels and Jackson<ref name=\"Getzels, J. W. 1962\" /> administered 5 creativity measures to a group of 449 children from grades 6-12, and compared these test findings to results from previously administered (by the school) IQ tests. They found that the correlation between the creativity measures and IQ was ''r'' = .26. The high creativity group scored in the top 20% of the overall creativity measures, but were not included in the top 20% of IQ scorers. The high intelligence group scored the opposite: they scored in the top 20% for IQ, but were outside the top 20% scorers for creativity, thus showing that creativity and intelligence are distinct and unrelated.\n\nHowever, this work has been heavily criticised. Wallach and Kogan<ref name=\"Wallach, M. A. 1965\" /> highlighted that the creativity measures were not only weakly related to one another (to the extent that they were no more related to one another than they were with IQ), but they seemed to also draw upon non-creative skills.

A. 1965\" /> administered 5 measures of creativity, each of which resulted in a score for originality and fluency; and 10 measures of general intelligence to 151 5th grade children. These tests were untimed, and given in a game-like manner (aiming to facilitate creativity). Inter-correlations between creativity tests were on average ''r'' = .41. Inter-correlations between intelligence measures were on average ''r'' = .51 with each other. Creativity tests and intelligence measures correlated ''r'' = .09.\n\n== Neuroscience ==\nThe [[neuroscience]] of creativity looks at the operation of the brain during creative behaviour. It has been addressed<ref name=\"NeuroPsychiatry\">[http://neurology.med.ohio-state.edu/cognitivelab/CreativityMechanisms.pdf Kenneth M Heilman, MD, Stephen E. Nadeau, MD, and David Q. Beversdorf, MD. \"Creative Innovation: Possible Brain Mechanisms\" Neurocase (2003)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319130652/http://neurology.med.ohio-state.edu/cognitivelab/CreativityMechanisms.pdf |date=2009-03-19 }}</ref> in the article \"Creative Innovation: Possible Brain Mechanisms.\" The authors write that \"creative innovation might require coactivation and communication between regions of the brain that ordinarily are not strongly connected.\" Highly creative people who excel at creative innovation tend to differ from others in three ways:\n* they have a high level of specialized knowledge,\n* they are capable of [[divergent thinking]] mediated by the [[frontal lobe]].\n* and they are able to modulate [[neurotransmitter]]s such as [[norepinephrine]] in their frontal lobe.\n\nThus, the frontal lobe appears to be the part of the [[cerebral cortex|cortex]] that is most important for creativity.\n\nThis article also explored the links between creativity and sleep, [[mood disorder|mood]] and [[substance dependence|addiction disorders]], and [[depression (mood)|depression]].\n\nIn 2005, Alice Flaherty presented a three-factor model of the creative drive. Drawing from evidence in brain imaging, drug studies and lesion analysis, she described the creative drive as resulting from an interaction of the frontal lobes, the [[temporal lobe]]s, and [[dopamine]] from the [[limbic system]]. The frontal lobes can be seen as responsible for idea generation, and the temporal lobes for idea editing and evaluation. Abnormalities in the frontal lobe (such as depression or anxiety) generally decrease creativity, while abnormalities in the temporal lobe often increase creativity. High activity in the temporal lobe typically inhibits activity in the frontal lobe, and vice versa. High dopamine levels increase general [[arousal]] and goal directed behaviors and reduce [[latent inhibition]], and all three effects increase the drive to generate ideas.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Flaherty AW | year = 2005 | title = Frontotemporal and dopaminergic control of idea generation and creative drive | url = | journal = J Comp Neurol | volume = 493 | issue = 1| pages = 147\u201353 | pmid = 16254989 | pmc = 2571074 | doi=10.1002/cne.20768}}</ref>  A 2015 study on creativity found that it involves the interaction of multiple neural networks, including those that support associative thinking, along with other [[default mode network]] functions.<ref name=PMID_26003860>{{ cite journal |last1 = Mayseless |first1 = Naama |last2 = Eran |first2 = Ayelet |last3 = Shamay-Tsoory |first3 = Simone G |year = 2015 |title = Generating original ideas: The neural underpinning of originality. |journal = NeuroImage |quote = These results are in line with the dual model of creativity, according to which original ideas are a product of the interaction between a system that generates ideas and a control system that evaluates these ideas. |lay-url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26003860 |doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.05.030|pmid = 26003860 |pages = 232\u20139 |volume = 116 }}</ref>\n\n=== Working memory and the cerebellum ===\nVandervert<ref>Vandervert 2003a, 2003b; Vandervert, Schimpf & Liu, 2007</ref> described how the brain's frontal lobes and the cognitive functions of the [[cerebellum]] collaborate to produce creativity and innovation. Vandervert's explanation rests on considerable evidence that all processes of [[working memory]] (responsible for processing all thought<ref>Miyake & Shah, 1999</ref>) are adaptively modeled for increased efficiency by the cerebellum.<ref>Schmahmann, 1997, 2004</ref> The cerebellum (consisting of 100 billion neurons, which is more than the entirety of the rest of the brain<ref>Andersen, Korbo & Pakkenberg, 1992.</ref>) is also widely known to adaptively model all bodily movement for efficiency. The cerebellum's adaptive models of working memory processing are then fed back to especially frontal lobe working memory control processes<ref>Miller & Cohen, 2001</ref> where creative and innovative thoughts arise.<ref>Vandervert, 2003a</ref> (Apparently, creative insight or the \"aha\" experience is then triggered in the temporal lobe.<ref>Jung-Beeman, Bowden, Haberman, Frymiare, Arambel-Liu, Greenblatt, Reber & Kounios, 2004</ref>)\n\nAccording to Vandervert, the details of creative adaptation begin in \"forward\" cerebellar models which are anticipatory/exploratory controls for movement and thought. These cerebellar processing and control architectures have been termed Hierarchical Modular Selection and Identification for Control (HMOSAIC).<ref>Imamizu, Kuroda, Miyauchi, Yoshioka & Kawato, 2003</ref> New, hierarchically arranged levels of the cerebellar control architecture (HMOSAIC) develop as mental mulling in working memory is extended over time. These new levels of the control architecture are fed forward to the frontal lobes. Since the cerebellum adaptively models all movement and all levels of thought and emotion,<ref>Schmahmann, 2004,</ref> Vandervert's approach helps explain creativity and innovation in sports, art, music, the design of video games, technology, mathematics, the [[child prodigy]], and thought in general.\n\nEssentially, Vandervert has argued that when a person is confronted with a challenging new situation, visual-spatial working memory and speech-related working memory are decomposed and re-composed (fractionated) by the cerebellum and then blended in the cerebral cortex in an attempt to deal with the new situation. With repeated attempts to deal with challenging situations, the cerebro-cerebellar blending process continues to optimize the efficiency of how working memory deals with the situation or problem.<ref>Vandervert, in press-a</ref> Most recently, he has argued that this is the same process (only involving visual-spatial working memory and pre-language vocalization) that led to the evolution of language in humans.<ref>Vandervert, 2011, in press-b</ref> Vandervert and Vandervert-Weathers have pointed out that this blending process, because it continuously optimizes efficiencies, constantly improves prototyping attempts toward the invention or innovation of new ideas, music, art, or technology.<ref>Vandervert & Vandervert-Weathers, 2013</ref> Prototyping, they argue, not only produces new products, it trains the cerebro-cerebellar pathways involved to become more efficient at prototyping itself. Further, Vandervert and Vandervert-Weathers believe that this repetitive \"mental prototyping\" or mental rehearsal involving the cerebellum and the cerebral cortex explains the success of the self-driven, individualized patterning of repetitions initiated by the teaching methods of the [[Khan Academy]]. The model proposed by Vandervert has, however, received incisive critique from several authors.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = J. | year = 2007 | title = On Vandervert et al. \"Working memory cerebellum, and creativity\" | url = | journal = Creat.

As noted in [[voting behavior]], the term \"affect\" in this context can refer to liking or disliking key aspects of the subject in question. This work largely follows from findings in psychology regarding the ways in which affective states are involved in human judgment and decision-making.<ref name=Winkielman2007>{{Citation\n | title = Affective Influence on Judgments and Decisions: Moving Towards Core Mechanisms\n | last1 = Winkielman | first1 = P.\n | last2 = Knutson | first2 = B.\n | year = 2007\n | journal = Review of General Psychology | volume = 11 | number = 2 | pages = 179\u2013192 | doi=10.1037/1089-2680.11.2.179\n | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/05cae5c1d17492926fd1951a3e1d1bfe4046687a }}</ref>\n\n=== Positive affect relations ===\nAccording to [[Alice M. Isen|Alice Isen]], positive affect has three primary effects on cognitive activity:\n# Positive affect makes additional cognitive material available for processing, increasing the number of cognitive elements available for association;\n# Positive affect leads to defocused attention and a more complex cognitive context, increasing the breadth of those elements that are treated as relevant to the problem;\n# Positive affect increases cognitive flexibility, increasing the probability that diverse cognitive elements will in fact become associated. Together, these processes lead positive affect to have a positive influence on creativity.\n\n[[Barbara Fredrickson]] in her [[broaden-and-build]] model suggests that positive emotions such as joy and love broaden a person's available repertoire of cognitions and actions, thus enhancing creativity.\n\nAccording to these researchers, positive emotions increase the number of cognitive elements available for association (attention scope) and the number of elements that are relevant to the problem (cognitive scope).\n\nVarious meta-analyses, such as Baas et al. (2008) of 66 studies about creativity and affect support the link between creativity and positive affect.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mark A.

Consider an agent able to manipulate its environment and thus its own [[sensory system|sensory]] inputs. The agent can use a [[black box]] optimization method such as [[reinforcement learning]] to learn (through informed trial and error) sequences of actions that maximize the expected sum of its future [[reward system|reward]] signals. There are extrinsic reward signals for achieving externally given goals, such as finding food when hungry. But Schmidhuber's [[Loss function|objective function]] to be maximized also includes an additional, intrinsic term to model \"wow-effects.\" This non-standard term motivates purely creative behavior of the agent even when there are no external goals. A wow-effect is formally defined as follows. As the agent is creating and predicting and encoding the continually growing history of actions and sensory inputs, it keeps improving the predictor or encoder, which can be implemented as an [[artificial neural network]] or some other [[machine learning]] device that can exploit regularities in the data to improve its performance over time. The improvements can be measured precisely, by computing the difference in computational costs (storage size, number of required synapses, errors, time) needed to encode new observations before and after learning. This difference depends on the encoder's present subjective knowledge, which changes over time, but the theory formally takes this into account. The cost difference measures the strength of the present \"wow-effect\" due to sudden improvements in [[data compression]] or computational speed. It becomes an intrinsic reward signal for the [[action selector]]. The objective function thus motivates the action optimizer to create action sequences causing more wow-effects. Irregular, random data (or noise) do not permit any wow-effects or learning progress, and thus are \"boring\" by nature (providing no reward). Already known and predictable regularities also are boring. Temporarily interesting are only the initially unknown, novel, regular patterns in both actions and observations. This motivates the agent to perform continual, open-ended, active, creative exploration.\n\nAccording to Schmidhuber, his objective function explains the activities of scientists, artists, and [[comedian]]s.<ref>Video of [[J\u00fcrgen Schmidhuber]]'s keynote at the 2011 Winter Intelligence Conference, Oxford: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnbZzcruGu0 Universal AI and Theory of Fun and Creativity.

A number of different theorists have suggested models of the creative person. One model suggests that there are four \"Creativity Profiles\" that can help produce growth, innovation, speed, etc.<ref>(DeGraff, Lawrence 2002)</ref>\n:(i) ''Incubate'' (Long-term Development)\n:(ii) ''Imagine'' (Breakthrough Ideas)\n:(iii) ''Improve'' (Incremental Adjustments)\n:(iv) ''Invest'' (Short-term Goals)\n\nResearch by Dr Mark Batey of the Psychometrics at Work Research Group at [[Manchester Business School]] has suggested that the creative profile can be explained by four primary creativity traits with narrow facets within each\n\n: (i) \"Idea Generation\" (Fluency, Originality, Incubation and Illumination)\n: (ii) \"Personality\" (Curiosity and Tolerance for Ambiguity)\n: (iii) \"Motivation\" (Intrinsic, Extrinsic and Achievement)\n: (iv) \"Confidence\" (Producing, Sharing and Implementing)\n\nThis model was developed in a sample of 1000 working adults using the statistical techniques of Exploratory Factor Analysis followed by Confirmatory Factor Analysis by Structural Equation Modelling.<ref>(Batey & Irwing, 2010) {{cite web |url=http://www.e-metrixx.com/creativity-profit/me2-spec/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710161255/http://www.e-metrixx.com/creativity-profit/me2-spec/ |archivedate=2011-07-10 }}</ref>\n\nAn important aspect of the creativity profiling approach is to account for the tension between predicting the creative profile of an individual, as characterised by the [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] approach, and the evidence that team creativity is founded on diversity and difference.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Nijstad B. A. |author2=De Dreu C.

''Divergent production'' is the ability of a person to generate a diverse assortment, yet an appropriate amount of responses to a given situation.<ref>(Guilford, 1950)</ref> One way of measuring ''divergent production'' is by administering the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking.<ref>(Torrance, 1974, 1984)</ref> The Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking assesses the diversity, quantity, and appropriateness of participants responses to a variety of open-ended questions.\n\nOther researchers of creativity see the difference in creative people as a cognitive process of dedication to problem solving and developing expertise in the field of their creative expression. Hard working people study the work of people before them and within their current area, become experts in their fields, and then have the ability to add to and build upon previous information in innovative and creative ways. In a study of projects by design students, students who had more knowledge on their subject on average had greater creativity within their projects.<ref>(Christiaans & Venselaar, 2007)</ref>\n\nThe aspect of motivation within a person's personality may predict creativity levels in the person. Motivation stems from two different sources, intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation is an internal drive within a person to participate or invest as a result of personal interest, desires, hopes, goals, etc. Extrinsic motivation is a drive from outside of a person and might take the form of payment, rewards, fame, approval from others, etc. Although extrinsic motivation and intrinsic motivation can both increase creativity in certain cases, strictly extrinsic motivation often impedes creativity in people.<ref>(Amabile, 1996; Prabhu et al., 2008)</ref>\n\nFrom a personality-traits perspective, there are a number of traits that are associated with creativity in people.<ref>(Feist, 1998, 1999; Prabhu et al., 2008; Zhang & Sternberg, 2009)</ref> Creative people tend to be more open to new experiences, are more self-confident, are more ambitious, self-accepting, impulsive, driven, dominant, and hostile, compared to people with less creativity.\n\nFrom an evolutionary perspective, creativity may be a result of the outcome of years of generating ideas. As ideas are continuously generated, the need to evolve produces a need for new ideas and developments. As a result, people have been creating and developing new, innovative, and creative ideas to build our progress as a society.<ref>(Campbell, 1960)</ref>\n\nIn studying exceptionally creative people in history, some common traits in lifestyle and environment are often found. Creative people in history usually had supportive parents, but rigid and non-nurturing. Most had an interest in their field at an early age, and most had a highly supportive and skilled mentor in their field of interest. Often the field they chose was relatively uncharted, allowing for their creativity to be expressed more in a field with less previous information. Most exceptionally creative people devoted almost all of their time and energy into their craft, and after about a decade had a creative breakthrough of fame. Their lives were marked with extreme dedication and a cycle of hard-work and breakthroughs as a result of their determination.<ref>(Gardner, 1993a, Policastro & Gardner, 1999)</ref>\n\nAnother theory of creative people is the ''investment theory of creativity''. This approach suggest that there are many individual and environmental factors that must exist in precise ways for extremely high levels of creativity opposed to average levels of creativity. In the ''investment'' sense, a person with their particular characteristics in their particular environment may see an opportunity to devote their time and energy into something that has been overlooked by others. The creative person develops an undervalued or under-recognised idea to the point that it is established as a new and creative idea. Just like in the financial world, some investments are worth the buy in, while others are less productive and do not build to the extent that the investor expected. This ''investment theory of creativity'' views creativity in a unique perspective compared to others, by asserting that creativity might rely to some extent on the right investment of effort being added to a field at the right time in the right way.<ref>(Sternberg & Lubart, 1991, 1995, 1996)</ref>\n\n== Malevolent creativity ==\n{{Main|Malevolent creativity}}\nSo called ''malevolent creativity'' is associated with the \"dark side\" of creativity.<ref name=\"The dark side of creativity\">{{cite journal | last1 = McLaren | first1 = R.

Malevolent creativity should be distinguished from negative creativity in that negative creativity may unintentionally cause harm to others, whereas malevolent creativity is explicitly malevolently motivated.

As creativity requires deviating from the conventional, there is a permanent tension between being creative and producing products that go too far and in some cases to the point of breaking the law. Aggression is a key predictor of malevolent creativity, and studies have also shown that increased levels of aggression also correlates to a higher likelihood of committing crime.<ref>Aggression: A social psychological analysis.\nBerkowitz, Leonard\nNew York, NY, US: McGraw-Hill Aggression: A social psychological analysis. (1962). xv 361 pp</ref>\n\n===Predictive factors===\nAlthough everyone shows some levels of malevolent creativity under certain conditions, those that have a higher propensity towards it have increased tendencies to deceive and manipulate others to their own gain. While malevolent creativity appears to dramatically increase when an individual is placed under unfair conditions, personality, particularly aggressiveness, is also a key predictor in anticipating levels of malevolent thinking. Researchers Harris and Reiter-Palmon investigated the role of aggression in levels of malevolent creativity, in particular levels of implicit aggression and the tendency to employ aggressive actions in response to problem solving.  The personality traits of physical aggression, conscientiousness, emotional intelligence and implicit aggression all seem to be related with malevolent creativity.<ref name=\"The dark side of creativity\"/> Harris and Reiter-Palmon's research showed that when subjects were presented with a problem that triggered malevolent creativity, participants high in implicit aggression and low in premeditation expressed the largest number of malevolently-themed solutions. When presented with the more benign problem that triggered prosocial motives of helping others and cooperating, those high in implicit aggression, even if they were high in impulsiveness, were far less destructive in their imagined solutions. They concluded premeditation, more than implicit aggression controlled an individual's expression of malevolent creativity.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Harris | first1 = D.

The leaders among other things wish to cheer and encourage the workers in order to achieve a higher level of creativity.]]\n\nIt has been the topic of various research studies to establish that organizational effectiveness depends on the creativity of the workforce to a large extent. For any given organization, measures of effectiveness vary, depending upon its mission, environmental context, nature of work, the product or service it produces, and customer demands. Thus, the first step in evaluating organizational effectiveness is to understand the organization itself \u2014 how it functions, how it is structured, and what it emphasizes.\n\nAmabile<ref name=\"Amabile98\">(Amabile, 1998; Sullivan and Harper, 2009)</ref> argued that to enhance creativity in business, three components were needed:\n* Expertise (technical, procedural and intellectual knowledge),\n* Creative thinking skills (how flexibly and imaginatively people approach problems),\n* and Motivation (especially [[intrinsic motivation]]).\n\nThere are two types of motivation:\n* [[Motivation|extrinsic motivation]] \u2013 [[Externality|external]] factors, for example [[threat]]s of being fired or money as a reward,\n* [[intrinsic motivation]] \u2013 comes from inside an individual, satisfaction, enjoyment of work, etc.\n\nSix managerial practices to encourage motivation are:\n* Challenge \u2013 matching people with the right assignments;\n* Freedom \u2013 giving people [[autonomy]] choosing means to achieve goals;\n* [[Resource]]s \u2013 such as time, money, space, etc. There must be balance fit among resources and people;\n* Work group features \u2013 [[Cultural diversity|diverse]], supportive teams, where members share the excitement, willingness to help, and recognize each other's talents;\n* [[Supervisor]]y encouragement \u2013 recognitions, cheering, praising;\n* Organizational support \u2013 value emphasis, information sharing, [[collaboration]].\n\nNonaka, who examined several successful Japanese companies, similarly saw creativity and knowledge creation as being important to the success of organizations.<ref name=\"Nonaka91\">(Nonaka, 1991)</ref> In particular, he emphasized the role that [[tacit knowledge]] has to play in the creative process.\n\nIn business, [[originality]] is not enough.

According to Reijo Siltala it links creativity to [[innovation]] process and [[competitive intelligence]] to creative workers.\n\nCreativity can be encouraged in people and professionals and in the workplace. It is essential for innovation, and is a factor affecting economic growth and businesses. In 2013, the sociologist Silvia Leal Mart\u00edn, using the Innova 3DX method, suggested measuring the various parameters that encourage creativity and innovation: corporate culture, work environment, leadership and management, creativity, self-esteem and optimism, locus of control and learning orientation, motivation, and fear.<ref>Leal, S. y Urrea J. \"Ingenio y Pasi\u00f3n\" (2013), Lid Publishers (Spanish) and Forbes India Magazine http://forbesindia.com/article/ie/new-trends-in-innovation-management/33905/1#ixzz2iiuuDxVq</ref>\n\nSimilarly, social psychologists, organizational scientists, and management scientists who conduct extensive research on the factors that influence creativity and innovation in teams and organizations have developed integrative theoretical models that emphasize the roles of team composition, team processes, and organizational culture, as well as the mutually reinforcing relationships between them in promoting innovation.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal | last1 = Woodman | first1 = R.

(2017) Creative Working in the Knowledge Economy. Abingdon, Oxfordshire: Routledge Ltd. {{ISBN|9781138211391}}; {{ISBN|9781315453095}}. https://www.routledge.com/Creative-Working-in-the-Knowledge-Economy/Loo/p/book/9781138211391</ref> on creative working in the knowledge economy brings together studies of creativity as delineated in this web page. It offers connections with the sections on the \u2018\u201dFour C\u201d model\u2019, \u2018Theories of creative processes\u2019, \u2018Creativity as a subset of intelligence\u2019, \u2018Creativity and personality\u2019, and \u2018In organisations\u2019 It is the last section that the investigation addresses.\n\nResearch studies of the knowledge economy may be classified into three levels: macro, meso and micro. Macro studies refer to investigations at a societal or transnational dimension. Meso studies focus on organisations. Micro investigations centre on the minutiae workings of workers. There is also an interdisciplinary dimension such as research from businesses (e.g. Burton-Jones, 1999; Drucker, 1999), economics (e.g. Cortada, 1998; Reich, 2001; Florida, 2003), education (e.g. Farrell and Fenwick, 2007; Brown, Lauder and Ashton, 2011), human resource management (e.g. Davenport, 2005), knowledge and organizational management (Alvesson, 2004; Defillippi, Arthur and Lindsay, 2006; Orr, Nutley, Russell, Bain, Hacking and Moran, 2016), sociology, psychology, and knowledge economy-related sectors \u2013 especially information technology (IT) software (e.g. O\u2019Riain, 2004; Nerland, 2008) and advertising (e.g. Grabher, 2004; Lury, 2004) (Loo, 2017).\n\nLoo (2017) studies how individual workers in the knowledge economy use their creativity and know-how in the advertising and IT software sectors. It examines this phenomenon across three developed countries of England, Japan and Singapore to observe global perspectives. Specifically, the study uses qualitative data from semi-structured interviews of the related professionals in the roles of creative directing and copywriting (in advertising), and systems software developing and software programme managing.\n\nThe study offers a conceptual framework (Loo, 2017, p.&nbsp;49) of a two-dimensional matrix of individual and collaborative working styles, and single and multi-contexts. The investigation draws on literature sources from the four disciplines of economics (e.g. Reich, 2001; Quah, 2002), management (e.g. ,Drucker, 1994; Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995; von Hippel, 2006), sociology (e.g. Zuboff, 1988; Bell, 1973; Lash and Urry, 1994; Castells, 2000; Knorr Cetina, 2005),  and psychology (e.g. Gardner, 1984; Csikszentmihalyi, 1988; Sternberg, Kaufman and Pretz, 2004). The themes arising from the analysis of knowledge work and creativity literature serve to create a distinct theoretical framework of creative knowledge work.  These workers apply their cognitive abilities, creative personalities and skill sets in the areas of science, technology, or culture industries to invent or discover new possibilities \u2013 e.g. a medium, product or service. These work activities may be done individually or collectively. Education, training and \u2018encultured environments\u2019 are necessary for the performance of these creative activities. Acts of creativity are viewed as asking new questions over and above those questions asked by an intelligent person, seeking novelty when reviewing a situation (Gardner, 1993), and creating something that is different and novel, i.e. a \u2018variation\u2019 on the idea of existing ideas in a domain (Csikszentmihalyi, 1988). This framework is evidenced by the empirical chapters on the micro-workings of creative workers in the two knowledge economy sectors from global perspectives.\n\nThis investigation identifies a definition of creative work, three types of work and the necessary conditions for it to occur. These workers use a combination of creative applications including anticipatory imagination, problem-solving, problem seeking, and generating ideas and aesthetic sensibilities. Taking aesthetic sensibilities as an example, for a creative director in the advertising industry, it is a visual imagery whether still or moving via a camera lens, and for a software programmer, it is the innovative technical expertise in which the software is written. There are specific creative applications for each of the sectors such as emotional connection in the advertising sector, and the power of expression and sensitivity in the IT software sector. In addition to the creative applications, creative workers require abilities and aptitudes to carry out their roles. Passion for one's job is generic. For copywriters, this passion is identified with fun, enjoyment and happiness alongside attributes such as honesty (regarding the product), confidence, and patience in finding the appropriate copy. Knowledge is also required in the disciplines of the humanities (e.g. literature), the creative arts (e.g. painting and music) and technical-related know-how (e.g. mathematics, computer sciences and physical sciences). In the IT software, technical knowledge of computer languages (e.g. C++) is especially significant for programmers whereas the degree of technical expertise may be less for a programme manager, as only knowledge of the relevant language is necessary to understand the issues for communicating with the team of developers and testers.\n\nThere are three types of work. One is intra-sectoral (e.g. \u2018general sponge\u2019 and \u2019in tune with the zeitgeist\u2019 [advertising], and \u2018power of expression\u2019 and \u2018sensitivity\u2019 [IT software]). The second is inter-sectoral (e.g. \u2018integration of advertising activities\u2019 [advertising], and \u2018autonomous decentralized systems\u2019 [ADS] [IT software]). The third relates to changes in culture/practices in the sectors (e.g. \u2018three-dimensional trust\u2019 and \u2018green credentials\u2019 [advertising], and \u2018collaboration with HEIs and industry\u2019 and \u2018ADS system in the Tokyo train operator\u2019 [IT software]).\n\nThe necessary conditions for creative work to exist are a supportive environment such as supportive information, communications and electronic technologies (ICET) infrastructure, training, work environment and education.\n\nThis investigation has implications for lifelong learning of these workers informally and formally. Teaching institutions need to offer multi-disciplinary knowledge of humanities, arts and sciences and it has impacts on the programme structure, delivery approaches and assessments. At a macro level, governments need to offer a rich diet of cultural activities, outdoor activities and sports fixtures that inform potential creative workers in the areas of video gaming and advertising. This study has implications for work organisations that support and encourage collaborative working alongside individual working, offer opportunities to engage in continuous professional development (formally and informally), and foster an environment, which promotes experiential functioning and supports experimentation.\n\n=== Team composition ===\nDiversity between team members\u2019 backgrounds and knowledge can increase team creativity by expanding the total collection of unique information that is available to the team and introducing different perspectives that can integrate in novel ways. However, under some conditions, diversity can also decrease team creativity by making it more difficult for team members to communicate about ideas and causing interpersonal conflicts between those with different perspectives.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Harvey | first1 = S | year = 2013 | title = A different perspective: The multiple effects of deep level diversity on group creativity | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 49 | issue = 5| pages = 822\u2013832 | doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2013.04.004}}</ref> Thus, the potential advantages of diversity must be supported by appropriate team processes and organizational cultures in order to enhance creativity.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\">{{cite journal | last1 = Paletz | first1 = S.

Some economists (such as [[Paul Romer]]) view creativity as an important element in the recombination of elements to produce new technologies and products and, consequently, economic growth. Creativity leads to [[capital (economics)|capital]], and creative products are protected by [[intellectual property]] laws.\n\n[[Mark A. Runco]] and Daniel Rubenson have tried to describe a \"[[Behavioral economics|psychoeconomic]]\" model of creativity.<ref name=\"RubRunc1992\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0732-118X(92)90021-Q|last=Rubenson|first=Daniel L.|author2=Runco, Mark |authorlink2=Mark A.

In his 2002 book, ''The Rise of the Creative Class'', [[economist]] [[Richard Florida]] popularized the notion that regions with \"3 T's of economic development: Technology, Talent and Tolerance\" also have high concentrations of [[creative professional]]s and tend to have a higher level of economic development.\n\n==Fostering creativity==\n{{Main|Creativity techniques}}\n\nSeveral different researchers have proposed methods of increasing the creativity of an individual. Such ideas range from the [[Psychology|psychological]]-cognitive, such as [[Alex Faickney Osborn|Osborn]]-[[Sid Parnes|Parnes]] [[Creative problem-solving|Creative Problem Solving Process]], [[Synectics]], science-based creative thinking, Purdue Creative Thinking Program, and [[Edward de Bono]]'s [[lateral thinking]]; to the highly structured, such as [[TRIZ]] (the Theory of Inventive Problem-Solving) and its variant Algorithm of Inventive Problem Solving (developed by the Russian scientist [[Genrich Altshuller]]), and Computer-Aided [[Morphological analysis (problem-solving)|morphological analysis]].\n\n[[Daniel H. Pink|Daniel Pink]], in his 2005 book ''A Whole New Mind'', repeating arguments posed throughout the 20th century, argues that we are entering a new age where creativity is becoming increasingly important. In this ''conceptual age'', we will need to foster and encourage ''right-directed thinking'' (representing creativity and emotion) over ''left-directed thinking'' (representing logical, analytical thought). However, this simplification of 'right' versus 'left' brain thinking is not supported by the research data.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/lives-the-brain/201004/creativity-the-brain-and-evolution|title=Creativity, the Brain, and Evolution|website=Psychology Today}}</ref>\n\nNickerson<ref name=\"Nickerson99handbook\">{{cite book|last=Nickerson|first=R.

In his work ''Art of Thought'', published in 1926, Wallas presented one of the first models of the creative process. In the Wallas stage model, creative insights and illuminations may be explained by a process consisting of 5 stages:\n:(i) ''[[Preparation (principle)|preparation]]'' (preparatory work on a problem that focuses the individual's mind on the problem and explores the problem's dimensions),\n:(ii) ''incubation'' (where the problem is internalized into the unconscious mind and nothing appears externally to be happening),\n:(iii) ''intimation'' (the creative person gets a \"feeling\" that a solution is on its way),\n:(iv) ''illumination'' or insight (where the creative idea bursts forth from its [[preconscious]] processing into conscious awareness);\n:(v) ''verification'' (where the idea is consciously verified, elaborated, and then applied).\nWallas' model is often treated as four stages, with \"intimation\" seen as a sub-stage.\n\nWallas considered creativity to be a legacy of the [[evolution]]ary process, which allowed humans to quickly adapt to rapidly changing environments.

Guilford}}</ref> drew a distinction between convergent and divergent production (commonly renamed [[convergent thinking|convergent]] and [[divergent thinking]]). Convergent thinking involves aiming for a single, correct solution to a problem, whereas divergent thinking involves creative generation of multiple answers to a set problem. Divergent thinking is sometimes used as a synonym for creativity in psychology literature. Other researchers have occasionally used the terms ''flexible'' thinking or [[fluid and crystallized intelligence|fluid intelligence]], which are roughly similar to (but not synonymous with) creativity.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2019|journal=Knowledge Cultures|volume=7|issue=2|pages=35|doi=10.22381/kc7220197|issn=2327-5731|title=The Relationship Between Individual Creativity Andcollective Intelligence in Modern Chinese Society}}</ref>\n\n=== Creative cognition approach ===\nIn 1992, Finke et al. proposed the \"Geneplore\" model, in which creativity takes place in two phases: a generative phase, where an individual constructs mental representations called preinventive structures, and an exploratory phase where those structures are used to come up with creative ideas. Some evidence shows that when people use their imagination to develop new ideas, those ideas are heavily structured in predictable ways by the properties of existing categories and concepts.<ref name=\"Ward1995\">Ward, T.B.

This new theory constitutes an attempt at providing a more unified explanation of relevant phenomena (in part by reinterpreting/integrating various fragmentary existing theories of [[Incubation (psychology)|incubation]] and [[insight]]).\n\nThe EII theory relies mainly on five basic principles, namely:\n# The co-existence of and the difference between explicit and implicit knowledge; \n# The simultaneous involvement of implicit and explicit processes in most tasks; \n# The redundant representation of explicit and implicit knowledge; \n# The integration of the results of explicit and implicit processing;\n# The iterative (and possibly bidirectional) processing. \nA computational implementation of the theory was developed based on the [[CLARION (cognitive architecture)|CLARION cognitive architecture]] and used to simulate relevant human data. This work represents an initial step in the development of process-based theories of creativity encompassing incubation, insight, and various other related phenomena.\n\n=== Conceptual blending ===\n{{Main|Conceptual blending}}\nIn ''[[The Act of Creation]]'', [[Arthur Koestler]] introduced the concept of ''bisociation'' \u2014 that creativity arises as a result of the intersection of two quite different frames of reference.<ref name=\"Koestler64\">{{cite book |author=Koestler, A. |title=The Act of Creation |year=1964 |authorlink=Arthur Koestler |isbn=978-0-330-73116-4 |publisher=Pan Books |location=London}}</ref> This idea was later developed into conceptual blending. In the 1990s, various approaches in cognitive science that dealt with [[metaphor]], [[analogy]], and [[structure mapping]] have been converging, and a new integrative approach to the study of creativity in science, art and humor has emerged under the label [[conceptual blending]].\n\n=== Honing theory ===\nHoning theory, developed principally by psychologist [[Liane Gabora]], posits that creativity arises due to the self-organizing, self-mending nature of a worldview. The creative process is a way in which the individual hones (and re-hones) an integrated worldview. Honing theory places emphasis not only on the externally visible creative outcome but also the internal cognitive restructuring and repair of the worldview brought about by the creative process. When faced with a creatively demanding task, there is an interaction between the conception of the task and the worldview. The conception of the task changes through interaction with the worldview, and the worldview changes through interaction with the task. This interaction is reiterated until the task is complete, at which point not only is the task conceived of differently, but the worldview is subtly or drastically transformed as it follows the natural tendency of a worldview to attempt to resolve dissonance and seek internal consistency amongst its components, whether they be ideas, attitudes, or bits of knowledge.\n\nA central feature of honing theory is the notion of a potentiality state.<ref>Gabora, L. & Saab, A. (2011). Creative interference and states of potentiality in analogy problem solving. ''Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society''. July 20\u201323, 2011, Boston MA.</ref> Honing theory posits that creative thought proceeds not by searching through and randomly \u2018mutating\u2019 predefined possibilities, but by drawing upon associations that exist due to overlap in the distributed neural cell assemblies that participate in the encoding of experiences in memory. Midway through the creative process one may have made associations between the current task and previous experiences, but not yet disambiguated which aspects of those previous experiences are relevant to the current task. Thus the creative idea may feel \u2018half-baked\u2019. It is at that point that it can be said to be in a potentiality state, because how it will actualize depends on the different internally or externally generated contexts it interacts with.\n\nHoning theory is held to explain certain phenomena not dealt with by other theories of creativity, for example, how different works by the same creator are observed in studies to exhibit a recognizable style or 'voice' even though in different creative outlets. This is not predicted by theories of creativity that emphasize chance processes or the accumulation of expertise, but it is predicted by honing theory, according to which personal style reflects the creator's uniquely structured worldview. Another example is in the environmental stimulus for creativity. Creativity is commonly considered to be fostered by a supportive, nurturing, trustworthy environment conducive to self-actualization. However, research shows that creativity is also associated with childhood adversity, which would stimulate honing.\n\n=== Everyday imaginative thought ===\nIn everyday thought, people often spontaneously imagine alternatives to reality when they think \"if only...\".<ref>Roese, N. J. & Olson, J. M. (1995). ''What Might Have Been: The Social Psychology of Counterfactual Thinking''. Mahwah, New Jersey: Erlbaum</ref> Their [[counterfactual thinking]] is viewed as an example of everyday creative processes.<ref>Markman, K. Klein, W. & Suhr, E. (eds) (2009).

It makes use of the results of divergent thinking tests (see below) by processing them further. It gives more weight to ideas that are radically different from other ideas in the response.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Snyder|first=Allan|date=2004|title=The creativity quotient: An objective scoring of ideational fluency|journal=Creativity Research Journal|volume=16|issue=4|pages=415\u2013419|doi=10.1080/10400410409534552}}</ref>\n\n=== Psychometric approach ===\n[[J. P. Guilford]]'s group,<ref name=\"Guilford67\" /> which pioneered the modern [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] study of creativity, constructed several tests to measure creativity in 1967:\n* Plot Titles, where participants are given the plot of a story and asked to write original titles.\n* Quick Responses is a word-association test scored for uncommonness.\n* Figure Concepts, where participants were given simple drawings of objects and individuals and asked to find qualities or features that are common by two or more drawings; these were scored for uncommonness.\n* Unusual Uses is finding unusual uses for common everyday objects such as bricks.\n* Remote Associations, where participants are asked to find a word between two given words (e.g. Hand _____ Call)\n* Remote Consequences, where participants are asked to generate a list of consequences of unexpected events (e.g. loss of gravity)\n\nOriginally, Guilford was trying to create a model for intellect as a whole, but in doing so also created a model for creativity. Guilford made an important assumption for creative research: creativity isn't one abstract concept. \u00a0The idea that creativity is a category rather than one single concept opened up the ability for other researchers to look at creativity with a whole new perspective.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite journal|last=Sternberg|first=Robert J.|last2=Grigorenko|first2=Elena L.|date=8 June 2010|title=Guilford's Structure of Intellect Model and Model of Creativity: Contributions and Limitations|journal= Creativity Research Journal|volume=13|issue=3\u20134|pages=309\u2013316|doi=10.1207/s15326934crj1334_08|issn=1040-0419}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Guilford|first=J.

Ideational fluency, or the ability rapidly to produce a variety of ideas that fulfill stated requirements;\n#: b. Associational fluency, or the ability to generate a list of words, each of which is associated with a given word; \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n#: c.

Type 2 is an unconscious process, and concerns spontaneous cognition, which encompasses daydreaming and implicit learning ability. Kaufman argues that creativity occurs as a result of Type 1 and Type 2 processes working together in combination. The use of each type in the creative process can be used to varying degrees.\n\n=== Intelligence as a subset of creativity ===\nIn this relationship model, intelligence is a key component in the development of creativity.\n\n''Theories of creativity that include intelligence as a subset of creativity''\n\n*Sternberg & Lubart's Investment Theory.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Sternberg | first1 = R.

Like under/low-valued stock, creative individuals generate unique ideas that are initially rejected by other people. The creative individual has to persevere, and convince the others of the ideas value. After convincing the others, and thus increasing the ideas value, the creative individual \u2018sells high\u2019 by leaving the idea with the other people, and moves onto generating another idea. According to this theory, six distinct, but related elements contribute to successful creativity: intelligence, knowledge, thinking styles, personality, motivation, and environment. Intelligence is just one of the six factors that can either solely, or in conjunction with the other five factors, generate creative thoughts.\n*Amabile's Componential Model of Creativity.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Amabile | first1 = T.

The researchers make use of the metaphor of the amusement park to demonstrate that within each of these creative levels, intelligence plays a key role:\n**To get into the amusement park, there are initial requirements (e.g., time/transport to go to the park). Initial requirements (like intelligence) are necessary, but not sufficient for creativity. They are more like prerequisites for creativity, and if an individual does not possess the basic level of the initial requirement (intelligence), then they will not be able to generate creative thoughts/behaviour.\n**Secondly are the subcomponents \u2013 general thematic areas \u2013 that increase in specificity. Like choosing which type of amusement park to visit (e.g. a zoo or a water park), these areas relate to the areas in which someone could be creative (e.g. poetry).\n**Thirdly, there are specific domains. After choosing the type of park to visit e.g. waterpark, you then have to choose which specific park to go to. Within the poetry domain, there are many different types (e.g. free verse, riddles, sonnet, etc.) that have to be selected from.\n**Lastly, there are micro-domains. These are the specific tasks that reside within each domain e.g. individual lines in a free verse poem / individual rides at the waterpark.\n\n=== Creativity and intelligence as overlapping yet distinct constructs ===\nThis possible relationship concerns creativity and intelligence as distinct, but intersecting constructs.\n\n''Theories that include Creativity and Intelligence as Overlapping Yet Distinct Constructs''\n\n*Renzulli's Three-Ring Conception of Giftedness.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Renzulli | first1 = J.

A number of previous research findings have suggested that a threshold exists in the relationship between creativity and intelligence \u2013 both constructs are moderately positively correlated up to an IQ of ~120.

Thus, creativity and Intelligence (problem solving) are the same thing. Perkins<ref>Perkins, D. N. (1981) The mind\u2019s best work. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.</ref> referred to this as the \u2018nothing-special\u2019 view.\n\nWeisberg & Alba<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Weisberg | first1 = R.

The problem can only be solved if the lines go outside the boundaries of the square of dots. Results demonstrated that even when participants were given this insight, they still found it difficult to solve the problem, thus showing that to successfully complete the task it is not just insight (or creativity) that is required.\n\n=== Creativity and intelligence as disjoint sets ===\nIn this view, creativity and intelligence are completely different, unrelated constructs.\n\nGetzels and Jackson<ref name=\"Getzels, J. W. 1962\" /> administered 5 creativity measures to a group of 449 children from grades 6-12, and compared these test findings to results from previously administered (by the school) IQ tests. They found that the correlation between the creativity measures and IQ was ''r'' = .26. The high creativity group scored in the top 20% of the overall creativity measures, but were not included in the top 20% of IQ scorers. The high intelligence group scored the opposite: they scored in the top 20% for IQ, but were outside the top 20% scorers for creativity, thus showing that creativity and intelligence are distinct and unrelated.\n\nHowever, this work has been heavily criticised. Wallach and Kogan<ref name=\"Wallach, M. A. 1965\" /> highlighted that the creativity measures were not only weakly related to one another (to the extent that they were no more related to one another than they were with IQ), but they seemed to also draw upon non-creative skills. McNemar<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = McNemar | first1 = O | year = 1964 | title = Lost: Our Intelligence?

A. 1965\" /> administered 5 measures of creativity, each of which resulted in a score for originality and fluency; and 10 measures of general intelligence to 151 5th grade children. These tests were untimed, and given in a game-like manner (aiming to facilitate creativity). Inter-correlations between creativity tests were on average ''r'' = .41. Inter-correlations between intelligence measures were on average ''r'' = .51 with each other. Creativity tests and intelligence measures correlated ''r'' = .09.\n\n== Neuroscience ==\nThe [[neuroscience]] of creativity looks at the operation of the brain during creative behaviour.

Beversdorf, MD. \"Creative Innovation: Possible Brain Mechanisms\" Neurocase (2003)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319130652/http://neurology.med.ohio-state.edu/cognitivelab/CreativityMechanisms.pdf |date=2009-03-19 }}</ref> in the article \"Creative Innovation: Possible Brain Mechanisms.\" The authors write that \"creative innovation might require coactivation and communication between regions of the brain that ordinarily are not strongly connected.\" Highly creative people who excel at creative innovation tend to differ from others in three ways:\n* they have a high level of specialized knowledge,\n* they are capable of [[divergent thinking]] mediated by the [[frontal lobe]].\n* and they are able to modulate [[neurotransmitter]]s such as [[norepinephrine]] in their frontal lobe.\n\nThus, the frontal lobe appears to be the part of the [[cerebral cortex|cortex]] that is most important for creativity.\n\nThis article also explored the links between creativity and sleep, [[mood disorder|mood]] and [[substance dependence|addiction disorders]], and [[depression (mood)|depression]].\n\nIn 2005, Alice Flaherty presented a three-factor model of the creative drive. Drawing from evidence in brain imaging, drug studies and lesion analysis, she described the creative drive as resulting from an interaction of the frontal lobes, the [[temporal lobe]]s, and [[dopamine]] from the [[limbic system]]. The frontal lobes can be seen as responsible for idea generation, and the temporal lobes for idea editing and evaluation. Abnormalities in the frontal lobe (such as depression or anxiety) generally decrease creativity, while abnormalities in the temporal lobe often increase creativity. High activity in the temporal lobe typically inhibits activity in the frontal lobe, and vice versa. High dopamine levels increase general [[arousal]] and goal directed behaviors and reduce [[latent inhibition]], and all three effects increase the drive to generate ideas.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Flaherty AW | year = 2005 | title = Frontotemporal and dopaminergic control of idea generation and creative drive | url = | journal = J Comp Neurol | volume = 493 | issue = 1| pages = 147\u201353 | pmid = 16254989 | pmc = 2571074 | doi=10.1002/cne.20768}}</ref>  A 2015 study on creativity found that it involves the interaction of multiple neural networks, including those that support associative thinking, along with other [[default mode network]] functions.<ref name=PMID_26003860>{{ cite journal |last1 = Mayseless |first1 = Naama |last2 = Eran |first2 = Ayelet |last3 = Shamay-Tsoory |first3 = Simone G |year = 2015 |title = Generating original ideas: The neural underpinning of originality. |journal = NeuroImage |quote = These results are in line with the dual model of creativity, according to which original ideas are a product of the interaction between a system that generates ideas and a control system that evaluates these ideas. |lay-url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26003860 |doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.05.030|pmid = 26003860 |pages = 232\u20139 |volume = 116 }}</ref>\n\n=== Working memory and the cerebellum ===\nVandervert<ref>Vandervert 2003a, 2003b; Vandervert, Schimpf & Liu, 2007</ref> described how the brain's frontal lobes and the cognitive functions of the [[cerebellum]] collaborate to produce creativity and innovation. Vandervert's explanation rests on considerable evidence that all processes of [[working memory]] (responsible for processing all thought<ref>Miyake & Shah, 1999</ref>) are adaptively modeled for increased efficiency by the cerebellum.<ref>Schmahmann, 1997, 2004</ref> The cerebellum (consisting of 100 billion neurons, which is more than the entirety of the rest of the brain<ref>Andersen, Korbo & Pakkenberg, 1992.</ref>) is also widely known to adaptively model all bodily movement for efficiency. The cerebellum's adaptive models of working memory processing are then fed back to especially frontal lobe working memory control processes<ref>Miller & Cohen, 2001</ref> where creative and innovative thoughts arise.<ref>Vandervert, 2003a</ref> (Apparently, creative insight or the \"aha\" experience is then triggered in the temporal lobe.<ref>Jung-Beeman, Bowden, Haberman, Frymiare, Arambel-Liu, Greenblatt, Reber & Kounios, 2004</ref>)\n\nAccording to Vandervert, the details of creative adaptation begin in \"forward\" cerebellar models which are anticipatory/exploratory controls for movement and thought. These cerebellar processing and control architectures have been termed Hierarchical Modular Selection and Identification for Control (HMOSAIC).<ref>Imamizu, Kuroda, Miyauchi, Yoshioka & Kawato, 2003</ref> New, hierarchically arranged levels of the cerebellar control architecture (HMOSAIC) develop as mental mulling in working memory is extended over time. These new levels of the control architecture are fed forward to the frontal lobes. Since the cerebellum adaptively models all movement and all levels of thought and emotion,<ref>Schmahmann, 2004,</ref> Vandervert's approach helps explain creativity and innovation in sports, art, music, the design of video games, technology, mathematics, the [[child prodigy]], and thought in general.\n\nEssentially, Vandervert has argued that when a person is confronted with a challenging new situation, visual-spatial working memory and speech-related working memory are decomposed and re-composed (fractionated) by the cerebellum and then blended in the cerebral cortex in an attempt to deal with the new situation. With repeated attempts to deal with challenging situations, the cerebro-cerebellar blending process continues to optimize the efficiency of how working memory deals with the situation or problem.<ref>Vandervert, in press-a</ref> Most recently, he has argued that this is the same process (only involving visual-spatial working memory and pre-language vocalization) that led to the evolution of language in humans.<ref>Vandervert, 2011, in press-b</ref> Vandervert and Vandervert-Weathers have pointed out that this blending process, because it continuously optimizes efficiencies, constantly improves prototyping attempts toward the invention or innovation of new ideas, music, art, or technology.<ref>Vandervert & Vandervert-Weathers, 2013</ref> Prototyping, they argue, not only produces new products, it trains the cerebro-cerebellar pathways involved to become more efficient at prototyping itself. Further, Vandervert and Vandervert-Weathers believe that this repetitive \"mental prototyping\" or mental rehearsal involving the cerebellum and the cerebral cortex explains the success of the self-driven, individualized patterning of repetitions initiated by the teaching methods of the [[Khan Academy]]. The model proposed by Vandervert has, however, received incisive critique from several authors.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = J. | year = 2007 | title = On Vandervert et al. \"Working memory cerebellum, and creativity\" | url = | journal = Creat.

As noted in [[voting behavior]], the term \"affect\" in this context can refer to liking or disliking key aspects of the subject in question. This work largely follows from findings in psychology regarding the ways in which affective states are involved in human judgment and decision-making.<ref name=Winkielman2007>{{Citation\n | title = Affective Influence on Judgments and Decisions: Moving Towards Core Mechanisms\n | last1 = Winkielman | first1 = P.\n | last2 = Knutson | first2 = B.\n | year = 2007\n | journal = Review of General Psychology | volume = 11 | number = 2 | pages = 179\u2013192 | doi=10.1037/1089-2680.11.2.179\n | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/05cae5c1d17492926fd1951a3e1d1bfe4046687a }}</ref>\n\n=== Positive affect relations ===\nAccording to [[Alice M. Isen|Alice Isen]], positive affect has three primary effects on cognitive activity:\n# Positive affect makes additional cognitive material available for processing, increasing the number of cognitive elements available for association;\n# Positive affect leads to defocused attention and a more complex cognitive context, increasing the breadth of those elements that are treated as relevant to the problem;\n# Positive affect increases cognitive flexibility, increasing the probability that diverse cognitive elements will in fact become associated. Together, these processes lead positive affect to have a positive influence on creativity.\n\n[[Barbara Fredrickson]] in her [[broaden-and-build]] model suggests that positive emotions such as joy and love broaden a person's available repertoire of cognitions and actions, thus enhancing creativity.\n\nAccording to these researchers, positive emotions increase the number of cognitive elements available for association (attention scope) and the number of elements that are relevant to the problem (cognitive scope).\n\nVarious meta-analyses, such as Baas et al. (2008) of 66 studies about creativity and affect support the link between creativity and positive affect.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mark A.

Consider an agent able to manipulate its environment and thus its own [[sensory system|sensory]] inputs. The agent can use a [[black box]] optimization method such as [[reinforcement learning]] to learn (through informed trial and error) sequences of actions that maximize the expected sum of its future [[reward system|reward]] signals. There are extrinsic reward signals for achieving externally given goals, such as finding food when hungry. But Schmidhuber's [[Loss function|objective function]] to be maximized also includes an additional, intrinsic term to model \"wow-effects.\" This non-standard term motivates purely creative behavior of the agent even when there are no external goals. A wow-effect is formally defined as follows. As the agent is creating and predicting and encoding the continually growing history of actions and sensory inputs, it keeps improving the predictor or encoder, which can be implemented as an [[artificial neural network]] or some other [[machine learning]] device that can exploit regularities in the data to improve its performance over time. The improvements can be measured precisely, by computing the difference in computational costs (storage size, number of required synapses, errors, time) needed to encode new observations before and after learning. This difference depends on the encoder's present subjective knowledge, which changes over time, but the theory formally takes this into account. The cost difference measures the strength of the present \"wow-effect\" due to sudden improvements in [[data compression]] or computational speed. It becomes an intrinsic reward signal for the [[action selector]]. The objective function thus motivates the action optimizer to create action sequences causing more wow-effects. Irregular, random data (or noise) do not permit any wow-effects or learning progress, and thus are \"boring\" by nature (providing no reward). Already known and predictable regularities also are boring. Temporarily interesting are only the initially unknown, novel, regular patterns in both actions and observations. This motivates the agent to perform continual, open-ended, active, creative exploration.\n\nAccording to Schmidhuber, his objective function explains the activities of scientists, artists, and [[comedian]]s.<ref>Video of [[J\u00fcrgen Schmidhuber]]'s keynote at the 2011 Winter Intelligence Conference, Oxford: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnbZzcruGu0 Universal AI and Theory of Fun and Creativity.

Likewise, composers receive intrinsic reward for creating non-arbitrary melodies with unexpected but regular harmonies that permit wow-effects through data compression improvements.\nSimilarly, a comedian gets intrinsic reward for \"inventing a novel joke with an unexpected [[punch line]], related to the beginning of the story in an initially unexpected but quickly learnable way that also allows for better compression of the perceived data.\"<ref>Kurzweil AI: [http://www.kurzweilai.net/when-creative-machines-overtake-man Transcript] of [[J\u00fcrgen Schmidhuber]]'s TEDx talk (2012): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ35zNlyG-o&list=PL194623EBA834DB77&index=11 When creative machines overtake man]</ref>\nSchmidhuber argues that ongoing [[computer hardware]] advances will greatly scale up rudimentary [[artificial intelligence|artificial]] scientists and artists{{clarify|date=January 2013}} based on simple implementations of the basic principle since 1990.<ref>Schmidhuber, J.

A number of different theorists have suggested models of the creative person. One model suggests that there are four \"Creativity Profiles\" that can help produce growth, innovation, speed, etc.<ref>(DeGraff, Lawrence 2002)</ref>\n:(i) ''Incubate'' (Long-term Development)\n:(ii) ''Imagine'' (Breakthrough Ideas)\n:(iii) ''Improve'' (Incremental Adjustments)\n:(iv) ''Invest'' (Short-term Goals)\n\nResearch by Dr Mark Batey of the Psychometrics at Work Research Group at [[Manchester Business School]] has suggested that the creative profile can be explained by four primary creativity traits with narrow facets within each\n\n: (i) \"Idea Generation\" (Fluency, Originality, Incubation and Illumination)\n: (ii) \"Personality\" (Curiosity and Tolerance for Ambiguity)\n: (iii) \"Motivation\" (Intrinsic, Extrinsic and Achievement)\n: (iv) \"Confidence\" (Producing, Sharing and Implementing)\n\nThis model was developed in a sample of 1000 working adults using the statistical techniques of Exploratory Factor Analysis followed by Confirmatory Factor Analysis by Structural Equation Modelling.<ref>(Batey & Irwing, 2010) {{cite web |url=http://www.e-metrixx.com/creativity-profit/me2-spec/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710161255/http://www.e-metrixx.com/creativity-profit/me2-spec/ |archivedate=2011-07-10 }}</ref>\n\nAn important aspect of the creativity profiling approach is to account for the tension between predicting the creative profile of an individual, as characterised by the [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] approach, and the evidence that team creativity is founded on diversity and difference.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Nijstad B.

''Divergent production'' is the ability of a person to generate a diverse assortment, yet an appropriate amount of responses to a given situation.<ref>(Guilford, 1950)</ref> One way of measuring ''divergent production'' is by administering the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking.<ref>(Torrance, 1974, 1984)</ref> The Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking assesses the diversity, quantity, and appropriateness of participants responses to a variety of open-ended questions.\n\nOther researchers of creativity see the difference in creative people as a cognitive process of dedication to problem solving and developing expertise in the field of their creative expression. Hard working people study the work of people before them and within their current area, become experts in their fields, and then have the ability to add to and build upon previous information in innovative and creative ways. In a study of projects by design students, students who had more knowledge on their subject on average had greater creativity within their projects.<ref>(Christiaans & Venselaar, 2007)</ref>\n\nThe aspect of motivation within a person's personality may predict creativity levels in the person. Motivation stems from two different sources, intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation is an internal drive within a person to participate or invest as a result of personal interest, desires, hopes, goals, etc. Extrinsic motivation is a drive from outside of a person and might take the form of payment, rewards, fame, approval from others, etc. Although extrinsic motivation and intrinsic motivation can both increase creativity in certain cases, strictly extrinsic motivation often impedes creativity in people.<ref>(Amabile, 1996; Prabhu et al., 2008)</ref>\n\nFrom a personality-traits perspective, there are a number of traits that are associated with creativity in people.<ref>(Feist, 1998, 1999; Prabhu et al., 2008; Zhang & Sternberg, 2009)</ref> Creative people tend to be more open to new experiences, are more self-confident, are more ambitious, self-accepting, impulsive, driven, dominant, and hostile, compared to people with less creativity.\n\nFrom an evolutionary perspective, creativity may be a result of the outcome of years of generating ideas. As ideas are continuously generated, the need to evolve produces a need for new ideas and developments. As a result, people have been creating and developing new, innovative, and creative ideas to build our progress as a society.<ref>(Campbell, 1960)</ref>\n\nIn studying exceptionally creative people in history, some common traits in lifestyle and environment are often found. Creative people in history usually had supportive parents, but rigid and non-nurturing. Most had an interest in their field at an early age, and most had a highly supportive and skilled mentor in their field of interest. Often the field they chose was relatively uncharted, allowing for their creativity to be expressed more in a field with less previous information. Most exceptionally creative people devoted almost all of their time and energy into their craft, and after about a decade had a creative breakthrough of fame. Their lives were marked with extreme dedication and a cycle of hard-work and breakthroughs as a result of their determination.<ref>(Gardner, 1993a, Policastro & Gardner, 1999)</ref>\n\nAnother theory of creative people is the ''investment theory of creativity''. This approach suggest that there are many individual and environmental factors that must exist in precise ways for extremely high levels of creativity opposed to average levels of creativity. In the ''investment'' sense, a person with their particular characteristics in their particular environment may see an opportunity to devote their time and energy into something that has been overlooked by others. The creative person develops an undervalued or under-recognised idea to the point that it is established as a new and creative idea. Just like in the financial world, some investments are worth the buy in, while others are less productive and do not build to the extent that the investor expected. This ''investment theory of creativity'' views creativity in a unique perspective compared to others, by asserting that creativity might rely to some extent on the right investment of effort being added to a field at the right time in the right way.<ref>(Sternberg & Lubart, 1991, 1995, 1996)</ref>\n\n== Malevolent creativity ==\n{{Main|Malevolent creativity}}\nSo called ''malevolent creativity'' is associated with the \"dark side\" of creativity.<ref name=\"The dark side of creativity\">{{cite journal | last1 = McLaren | first1 = R.

Malevolent creativity should be distinguished from negative creativity in that negative creativity may unintentionally cause harm to others, whereas malevolent creativity is explicitly malevolently motivated.

As creativity requires deviating from the conventional, there is a permanent tension between being creative and producing products that go too far and in some cases to the point of breaking the law. Aggression is a key predictor of malevolent creativity, and studies have also shown that increased levels of aggression also correlates to a higher likelihood of committing crime.<ref>Aggression: A social psychological analysis.\nBerkowitz, Leonard\nNew York, NY, US: McGraw-Hill Aggression: A social psychological analysis. (1962). xv 361 pp</ref>\n\n===Predictive factors===\nAlthough everyone shows some levels of malevolent creativity under certain conditions, those that have a higher propensity towards it have increased tendencies to deceive and manipulate others to their own gain. While malevolent creativity appears to dramatically increase when an individual is placed under unfair conditions, personality, particularly aggressiveness, is also a key predictor in anticipating levels of malevolent thinking. Researchers Harris and Reiter-Palmon investigated the role of aggression in levels of malevolent creativity, in particular levels of implicit aggression and the tendency to employ aggressive actions in response to problem solving.  The personality traits of physical aggression, conscientiousness, emotional intelligence and implicit aggression all seem to be related with malevolent creativity.<ref name=\"The dark side of creativity\"/> Harris and Reiter-Palmon's research showed that when subjects were presented with a problem that triggered malevolent creativity, participants high in implicit aggression and low in premeditation expressed the largest number of malevolently-themed solutions. When presented with the more benign problem that triggered prosocial motives of helping others and cooperating, those high in implicit aggression, even if they were high in impulsiveness, were far less destructive in their imagined solutions. They concluded premeditation, more than implicit aggression controlled an individual's expression of malevolent creativity.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Harris | first1 = D.

The leaders among other things wish to cheer and encourage the workers in order to achieve a higher level of creativity.]]\n\nIt has been the topic of various research studies to establish that organizational effectiveness depends on the creativity of the workforce to a large extent. For any given organization, measures of effectiveness vary, depending upon its mission, environmental context, nature of work, the product or service it produces, and customer demands. Thus, the first step in evaluating organizational effectiveness is to understand the organization itself \u2014 how it functions, how it is structured, and what it emphasizes.\n\nAmabile<ref name=\"Amabile98\">(Amabile, 1998; Sullivan and Harper, 2009)</ref> argued that to enhance creativity in business, three components were needed:\n* Expertise (technical, procedural and intellectual knowledge),\n* Creative thinking skills (how flexibly and imaginatively people approach problems),\n* and Motivation (especially [[intrinsic motivation]]).\n\nThere are two types of motivation:\n* [[Motivation|extrinsic motivation]] \u2013 [[Externality|external]] factors, for example [[threat]]s of being fired or money as a reward,\n* [[intrinsic motivation]] \u2013 comes from inside an individual, satisfaction, enjoyment of work, etc.\n\nSix managerial practices to encourage motivation are:\n* Challenge \u2013 matching people with the right assignments;\n* Freedom \u2013 giving people [[autonomy]] choosing means to achieve goals;\n* [[Resource]]s \u2013 such as time, money, space, etc. There must be balance fit among resources and people;\n* Work group features \u2013 [[Cultural diversity|diverse]], supportive teams, where members share the excitement, willingness to help, and recognize each other's talents;\n* [[Supervisor]]y encouragement \u2013 recognitions, cheering, praising;\n* Organizational support \u2013 value emphasis, information sharing, [[collaboration]].\n\nNonaka, who examined several successful Japanese companies, similarly saw creativity and knowledge creation as being important to the success of organizations.<ref name=\"Nonaka91\">(Nonaka, 1991)</ref> In particular, he emphasized the role that [[tacit knowledge]] has to play in the creative process.\n\nIn business, [[originality]] is not enough.

According to Reijo Siltala it links creativity to [[innovation]] process and [[competitive intelligence]] to creative workers.\n\nCreativity can be encouraged in people and professionals and in the workplace. It is essential for innovation, and is a factor affecting economic growth and businesses. In 2013, the sociologist Silvia Leal Mart\u00edn, using the Innova 3DX method, suggested measuring the various parameters that encourage creativity and innovation: corporate culture, work environment, leadership and management, creativity, self-esteem and optimism, locus of control and learning orientation, motivation, and fear.<ref>Leal, S. y Urrea J. \"Ingenio y Pasi\u00f3n\" (2013), Lid Publishers (Spanish) and Forbes India Magazine http://forbesindia.com/article/ie/new-trends-in-innovation-management/33905/1#ixzz2iiuuDxVq</ref>\n\nSimilarly, social psychologists, organizational scientists, and management scientists who conduct extensive research on the factors that influence creativity and innovation in teams and organizations have developed integrative theoretical models that emphasize the roles of team composition, team processes, and organizational culture, as well as the mutually reinforcing relationships between them in promoting innovation.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal | last1 = Woodman | first1 = R.

(2017) Creative Working in the Knowledge Economy. Abingdon, Oxfordshire: Routledge Ltd. {{ISBN|9781138211391}}; {{ISBN|9781315453095}}. https://www.routledge.com/Creative-Working-in-the-Knowledge-Economy/Loo/p/book/9781138211391</ref> on creative working in the knowledge economy brings together studies of creativity as delineated in this web page. It offers connections with the sections on the \u2018\u201dFour C\u201d model\u2019, \u2018Theories of creative processes\u2019, \u2018Creativity as a subset of intelligence\u2019, \u2018Creativity and personality\u2019, and \u2018In organisations\u2019 It is the last section that the investigation addresses.\n\nResearch studies of the knowledge economy may be classified into three levels: macro, meso and micro. Macro studies refer to investigations at a societal or transnational dimension. Meso studies focus on organisations. Micro investigations centre on the minutiae workings of workers. There is also an interdisciplinary dimension such as research from businesses (e.g. Burton-Jones, 1999; Drucker, 1999), economics (e.g. Cortada, 1998; Reich, 2001; Florida, 2003), education (e.g. Farrell and Fenwick, 2007; Brown, Lauder and Ashton, 2011), human resource management (e.g. Davenport, 2005), knowledge and organizational management (Alvesson, 2004; Defillippi, Arthur and Lindsay, 2006; Orr, Nutley, Russell, Bain, Hacking and Moran, 2016), sociology, psychology, and knowledge economy-related sectors \u2013 especially information technology (IT) software (e.g. O\u2019Riain, 2004; Nerland, 2008) and advertising (e.g. Grabher, 2004; Lury, 2004) (Loo, 2017).\n\nLoo (2017) studies how individual workers in the knowledge economy use their creativity and know-how in the advertising and IT software sectors. It examines this phenomenon across three developed countries of England, Japan and Singapore to observe global perspectives. Specifically, the study uses qualitative data from semi-structured interviews of the related professionals in the roles of creative directing and copywriting (in advertising), and systems software developing and software programme managing.\n\nThe study offers a conceptual framework (Loo, 2017, p.&nbsp;49) of a two-dimensional matrix of individual and collaborative working styles, and single and multi-contexts. The investigation draws on literature sources from the four disciplines of economics (e.g. Reich, 2001; Quah, 2002), management (e.g. ,Drucker, 1994; Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995; von Hippel, 2006), sociology (e.g. Zuboff, 1988; Bell, 1973; Lash and Urry, 1994; Castells, 2000; Knorr Cetina, 2005),  and psychology (e.g. Gardner, 1984; Csikszentmihalyi, 1988; Sternberg, Kaufman and Pretz, 2004). The themes arising from the analysis of knowledge work and creativity literature serve to create a distinct theoretical framework of creative knowledge work.  These workers apply their cognitive abilities, creative personalities and skill sets in the areas of science, technology, or culture industries to invent or discover new possibilities \u2013 e.g. a medium, product or service. These work activities may be done individually or collectively. Education, training and \u2018encultured environments\u2019 are necessary for the performance of these creative activities. Acts of creativity are viewed as asking new questions over and above those questions asked by an intelligent person, seeking novelty when reviewing a situation (Gardner, 1993), and creating something that is different and novel, i.e. a \u2018variation\u2019 on the idea of existing ideas in a domain (Csikszentmihalyi, 1988). This framework is evidenced by the empirical chapters on the micro-workings of creative workers in the two knowledge economy sectors from global perspectives.\n\nThis investigation identifies a definition of creative work, three types of work and the necessary conditions for it to occur. These workers use a combination of creative applications including anticipatory imagination, problem-solving, problem seeking, and generating ideas and aesthetic sensibilities. Taking aesthetic sensibilities as an example, for a creative director in the advertising industry, it is a visual imagery whether still or moving via a camera lens, and for a software programmer, it is the innovative technical expertise in which the software is written. There are specific creative applications for each of the sectors such as emotional connection in the advertising sector, and the power of expression and sensitivity in the IT software sector. In addition to the creative applications, creative workers require abilities and aptitudes to carry out their roles. Passion for one's job is generic. For copywriters, this passion is identified with fun, enjoyment and happiness alongside attributes such as honesty (regarding the product), confidence, and patience in finding the appropriate copy. Knowledge is also required in the disciplines of the humanities (e.g. literature), the creative arts (e.g. painting and music) and technical-related know-how (e.g. mathematics, computer sciences and physical sciences). In the IT software, technical knowledge of computer languages (e.g. C++) is especially significant for programmers whereas the degree of technical expertise may be less for a programme manager, as only knowledge of the relevant language is necessary to understand the issues for communicating with the team of developers and testers.\n\nThere are three types of work. One is intra-sectoral (e.g. \u2018general sponge\u2019 and \u2019in tune with the zeitgeist\u2019 [advertising], and \u2018power of expression\u2019 and \u2018sensitivity\u2019 [IT software]). The second is inter-sectoral (e.g. \u2018integration of advertising activities\u2019 [advertising], and \u2018autonomous decentralized systems\u2019 [ADS] [IT software]). The third relates to changes in culture/practices in the sectors (e.g. \u2018three-dimensional trust\u2019 and \u2018green credentials\u2019 [advertising], and \u2018collaboration with HEIs and industry\u2019 and \u2018ADS system in the Tokyo train operator\u2019 [IT software]).\n\nThe necessary conditions for creative work to exist are a supportive environment such as supportive information, communications and electronic technologies (ICET) infrastructure, training, work environment and education.\n\nThis investigation has implications for lifelong learning of these workers informally and formally. Teaching institutions need to offer multi-disciplinary knowledge of humanities, arts and sciences and it has impacts on the programme structure, delivery approaches and assessments. At a macro level, governments need to offer a rich diet of cultural activities, outdoor activities and sports fixtures that inform potential creative workers in the areas of video gaming and advertising. This study has implications for work organisations that support and encourage collaborative working alongside individual working, offer opportunities to engage in continuous professional development (formally and informally), and foster an environment, which promotes experiential functioning and supports experimentation.\n\n=== Team composition ===\nDiversity between team members\u2019 backgrounds and knowledge can increase team creativity by expanding the total collection of unique information that is available to the team and introducing different perspectives that can integrate in novel ways. However, under some conditions, diversity can also decrease team creativity by making it more difficult for team members to communicate about ideas and causing interpersonal conflicts between those with different perspectives.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Harvey | first1 = S | year = 2013 | title = A different perspective: The multiple effects of deep level diversity on group creativity | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 49 | issue = 5| pages = 822\u2013832 | doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2013.04.004}}</ref> Thus, the potential advantages of diversity must be supported by appropriate team processes and organizational cultures in order to enhance creativity.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\">{{cite journal | last1 = Paletz | first1 = S.

Some economists (such as [[Paul Romer]]) view creativity as an important element in the recombination of elements to produce new technologies and products and, consequently, economic growth. Creativity leads to [[capital (economics)|capital]], and creative products are protected by [[intellectual property]] laws.\n\n[[Mark A. Runco]] and Daniel Rubenson have tried to describe a \"[[Behavioral economics|psychoeconomic]]\" model of creativity.<ref name=\"RubRunc1992\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0732-118X(92)90021-Q|last=Rubenson|first=Daniel L.|author2=Runco, Mark |authorlink2=Mark A. Runco |title=The psychoeconomic approach to creativity|journal=New Ideas in Psychology|year=1992|volume=10|issue=2|pages=131\u2013147}}</ref> In such a model, creativity is the product of endowments and active investments in creativity; the costs and benefits of bringing creative activity to market determine the supply of creativity. Such an approach has been criticised for its view of creativity consumption as always having positive [[utility]], and for the way it analyses the value of future innovations.<ref name=\"Diamond1992\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0732-118X(92)90023-S|last=Diamond|first=Arthur M.|title=Creativity and Interdisciplinarity: A Response to Rubenson and Runco|journal=New Ideas in Psychology|year=1992|volume=10|issue=2|pages=157\u2013160}}</ref>\n\nThe ''[[creative class]]'' is seen by some to be an important driver of modern economies. In his 2002 book, ''The Rise of the Creative Class'', [[economist]] [[Richard Florida]] popularized the notion that regions with \"3 T's of economic development: Technology, Talent and Tolerance\" also have high concentrations of [[creative professional]]s and tend to have a higher level of economic development.\n\n==Fostering creativity==\n{{Main|Creativity techniques}}\n\nSeveral different researchers have proposed methods of increasing the creativity of an individual. Such ideas range from the [[Psychology|psychological]]-cognitive, such as [[Alex Faickney Osborn|Osborn]]-[[Sid Parnes|Parnes]] [[Creative problem-solving|Creative Problem Solving Process]], [[Synectics]], science-based creative thinking, Purdue Creative Thinking Program, and [[Edward de Bono]]'s [[lateral thinking]]; to the highly structured, such as [[TRIZ]] (the Theory of Inventive Problem-Solving) and its variant Algorithm of Inventive Problem Solving (developed by the Russian scientist [[Genrich Altshuller]]), and Computer-Aided [[Morphological analysis (problem-solving)|morphological analysis]].\n\n[[Daniel H. Pink|Daniel Pink]], in his 2005 book ''A Whole New Mind'', repeating arguments posed throughout the 20th century, argues that we are entering a new age where creativity is becoming increasingly important. In this ''conceptual age'', we will need to foster and encourage ''right-directed thinking'' (representing creativity and emotion) over ''left-directed thinking'' (representing logical, analytical thought). However, this simplification of 'right' versus 'left' brain thinking is not supported by the research data.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/lives-the-brain/201004/creativity-the-brain-and-evolution|title=Creativity, the Brain, and Evolution|website=Psychology Today}}</ref>\n\nNickerson<ref name=\"Nickerson99handbook\">{{cite book|last=Nickerson|first=R.

He was Kiwi number 136 after playing two tests for New Zealand against Australia in 1919.\n\n==Early Life==\nIt is unclear where Thomas Haddon was born or raised. The first clear indication of him being in Auckland is with his debut for [[City Rovers]] in the opening game of the [[1918 Auckland Rugby League season]]. There are no records of him being born or marrying in [[New Zealand]]. At the start of 1920 he was thought to have moved to [[Australia]] to play rugby league but there are no records of him playing there after being given permission by the New Zealand Rugby League Council.\n\n==Playing career==\n===City Rovers, Auckland, and New Zealand===\nTom Haddon first appeared for [[City Rovers]] in 1918 in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition, playing for them against [[Grafton Athletic]] in a preliminary round to open the season <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Northern Union/Teams for Saturday/North Shore\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume XLIX, Issue 99\n| date = 1918-04-26\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19180426.2.15\n| accessdate = 2020-04-15}}</ref>. He scored a try in a Round 3 match against Grafton Athletic at [[Victoria Park, Auckland|Victoria Park]] where he \u201creceived a cross-kick and scored underneath the posts\u201d with City going on to win 11-10 <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Championship Matches/Newton V Ponsonby/Grafton V City\n| page =7\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LV| issue=16860\n| date = 1918-05-27\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180527.2.62.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-18}}</ref>. He scored against the same opponents in the second round in front of 5,000 spectators again at Victoria Park <ref>{{cite news\n| title =City Defeats Grafton\n| page =7\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LV| issue=16896\n| date = 1918-06-08\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180708.2.50\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>.\n\nHe was selected for the [[Auckland Rugby League team|Auckland]] team in 1918 and played in the first proper inter provincial match that Auckland had played since [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|1915]] (when they played Thames twice, and Lower Waikato once). During the war the [[Auckland rugby League]] had decided to largely cease its representative program. Haddon\u2019s debut was against Canterbury and it resulted in a comfortable 45-9 victory to Auckland with Haddon scoring twice. The match was played in front of 10,000 spectators at the [[Auckland Domain]] <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland Defeats Canterbury/Forty-Five Points to Nine\n| page =3\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LV| issue=16956\n| date = 1918-09-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180916.2.15.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>.\n\nIn 1919 Haddon was again playing for City and in a round two match against [[North Shore Albions]] on the Devonport Domain in front of 500 spectators <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Championships Continue/City V North Shore\n| page =5\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LVI| issue=17158\n| date = 1919-05-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190512.2.21.2\n| accessdate = 2019-08-19}}</ref>. On August 9, Haddon played for Auckland in a match against Hawkes Bay at Eden Park before a crowd of 9,000. Haddon scored 3 tries in a 38 to 13 victory <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Representative Match/Auckland V Hawke\u2019s Bay\n| page =9\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LVI| issue=17235\n| date = 1911-08-11\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190811.2.111.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-18}}</ref>. As this was to be his last game for Auckland it meant that he had scored 3 tries for his City team in 2 full seasons but managed to cross the line 5 times for Auckland in just 2 appearance.\n\nHaddon had been picked to tour Australia with the New Zealand team in June and July of 1919 but due to circumstances was unable to make the trip <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Football/Northern Union\n| page = 7\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LI, Issue 65\n| date = 1920-03-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19200316.2.67.2\n| accessdate = 2020-04-15}}</ref>. He was however selected for the 3rd and 4th tests against the touring Australian team in August/September <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Kangaroos Tour 1919\n| publisher = Rugby League Project\n| url = https://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/competitions/kangaroos-tour-1919/summary.html\n| accessdate = 2020-04-15}}</ref>. On September 6, Tom Haddon became Kiwi number 136 when he played lock in front of 24,300 spectators at the [[Auckland Domain]]. New Zealand were defeated 34 to 23 <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Inter-Colonial League/The Kiwi and the Kangaroo\n| page = 8\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume L, Issue 213\n| date = 1909-09-08\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19190908.2.129\n| accessdate = 2020-04-15}}</ref>. In the third test also played on the Domain New Zealand was heavily beaten by 32 points to 2 with Haddon moving into the prop position <ref>{{cite news\n| title = The Last Test/Australia\u2019s Decisive Win\n| page = 9\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume 219, Issue L\n| date = 1919-09-15\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19190915.2.98\n| accessdate = 2020-04-15}}</ref>.\n\nIn April, 1920 [[Auckland Rugby League]] gave its permission for Haddon to \u201cplay in any district outside Auckland\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Under League Rules/The Auckland League\n| page = 8\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVII, Issue 17447\n| date = 1920-03-17\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19200417.2.80.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-14}}</ref>. Then on May 10 the New Zealand Rugby League Council granted him an open transfer to play in Australia as reported in the New Zealand Herald <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Under League Rules/The New Zealand Council\n| page = 6\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVII, Issue 17467\n| date = 1920-05-11\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19200511.2.96.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-14}}</ref>.

It is however unclear as to where he went and if he played rugby league over the following years.\n\n===North Shore Albions===\nIn 1925 Haddon resumed playing rugby league in Auckland, this time however he was to represent the [[North Shore Albions]] who at this time were in fact named [[North Shore Albions|Devonport United]] after amalgamating with the Sunnyside League Football Club at the start of the 1920 season <ref>{{cite news \n| title =Two Clubs Amalgamate\n| page =6\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LVII| issue=17436\n| date = 1920-03-05\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19200405.2.100\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>. The first mention of him in a Devonport uniform is in a match against his old City team at [[Carlaw Park]] where he scored a try <ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Code/Another Great Game/City Beat Devonport\n| page = 9\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LVI, Issue 133,\n| date = 1925-06-08\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19250608.2.147\n| accessdate = 2020-04-14}}</ref>. The day was significant for other reasons as the teams stood in silence before the kick off out of respect for [[Bill Stormont]] (Kiwi #140) who had died two days earlier. In a July match Haddon scored a try in front of 9,000 spectators at Carlaw Park against [[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]]. Devonport won but not before Haddon was sent off along with Marist\u2019s New Zealand international [[Andrew O\u2019Brien (rugby league)|Jim O\u2019Brien]] after a \u201crough-up\u201d between the two. Devonport won the match 19-11 <ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Code/Devonport\u2019s Day Out/Marists v Devonport\n| page = 9\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LVI, Issue 145\n| date = 1925-06-22\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19250622.2.108\n| accessdate = 2020-04-14}}</ref>.\n\nAfter a July match between Ponsonby and Devonport it was said of Haddon \u201cit is surprising how youth sticks to some footballers. On Saturday the veteran \u2026 was easily Devonport\u2019s best forward. He showed a lot of pace and some of the form displayed several years ago when playing for [[City Rovers|City]]\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = League Football Notes and Comments/The North Shore Players\n| page =6 \n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LXII, Issue 19069\n| date = 1925-07-14\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19250714.2.9.2\n| accessdate = 2020-04-14}}</ref>. Then against Athletic \u201cHaddon, following up fast secured, and beating several Athletic players, scored behind the posts with three men hanging on to him\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = League Football/Club Competitions/Athletic v Devonport\n| page = 10\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LVI, Issue 169\n| date = 1925-07-20\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19250720.2.137\n| accessdate = 2020-04-14}}</ref>. He scored a second try later in the match after a \u201cpassing rush\u201d in which all the Devonport players took part. Haddon\u2019s final ever senior league match was in a Roope Rooster semi final loss to his old City Rovers team <ref>{{cite news\n| title = League Football/City Defeat Devonport\n| page = 14\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LXII\n| date = 1925-08-17\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19250817.2.136\n| accessdate = 2020-04-14}}</ref>.\n\nIn 1926, 27, 28, and again in 1934 Haddon played in several veteran player exhibition matches. On October 30, 1926 Haddon made an appearance in an end of season game played between well known league veterans at Carlaw Park. Haddon was representing early New Zealand rugby league legends [[Albert Asher]]\u2019s team against [[William Wynyard (rugby league)|William Wynyard]]\u2019s team <ref>{{cite news\n| title = End of Season Games/Veteran Players in Action\n| page = 15\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LXIII, Issue 19473\n| date = 1926-11-01\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19261101.2.138\n| accessdate = 2020-04-14}}</ref>. The match finished 10-10 and featured the likes of [[Eric Bennett (New Zealand)|Eric Bennett]], [[Bill Davidson (rugby league)|Bill Davidson]], and [[Thomas McClymont]]. In September, 1927 he was chosen in a Devonport United veteran team <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Rugby League/Devonport United\n| page = 11\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LVIII, Issue 207\n| date = 1927-09-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19270902.2.138.21\n| accessdate = 2020-04-15}}</ref>.

He was Kiwi number 136 after playing two tests for New Zealand against Australia in 1919.\n\n==Early Life==\nIt is unclear where Thomas Haddon was born or raised. The first clear indication of him being in Auckland is with his debut for [[City Rovers]] in the opening game of the season of 1918. There are no records of him being born or marrying in New Zealand. At the start of 1920 he was thought to have moved to Australia to play rugby league but there are no records of him playing there.\n\n==Playing career==\n===City Rovers, Auckland, and New Zealand===\nTom Haddon first appeared for [[City Rovers]] in 1918 in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition, playing for them against [[Grafton Athletic]] in a preliminary round to open the season <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Northern Union/Teams for Saturday/North Shore\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume XLIX, Issue 99\n| date = 1918-04-26\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19180426.2.15\n| accessdate = 2020-04-15}}</ref>. He scored a try in a Round 3 match against Grafton Athletic at [[Victoria Park, Auckland|Victoria Park]] where he \u201creceived a cross-kick and scored underneath the posts\u201d with City going on to win 11-10 <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Championship Matches/Newton V Ponsonby/Grafton V City\n| page =7\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LV| issue=16860\n| date = 1918-05-27\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180527.2.62.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-18}}</ref>.

During the war the [[Auckland rugby League]] had decided to largely cease its representative program. Haddon\u2019s debut was against Canterbury and it resulted in a comfortable 45-9 victory to Auckland with Haddon scoring twice. The match was played in front of 10,000 spectators at the [[Auckland Domain]] <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland Defeats Canterbury/Forty-Five Points to Nine\n| page =3\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LV| issue=16956\n| date = 1918-09-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180916.2.15.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>.\n\nIn 1919 Haddon was again playing for City and in a round two match against [[North Shore Albions]] on the Devonport Domain in front of 500 spectators <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Championships Continue/City V North Shore\n| page =5\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LVI| issue=17158\n| date = 1919-05-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190512.2.21.2\n| accessdate = 2019-08-19}}</ref>.

It is however unclear as to where he went and if he played rugby league over the following years.\n\n===North Shore Albions===\nIn 1925 Haddon resumed playing rugby league in Auckland, this time however he was to represent the [[North Shore Albions]] who at this time were in fact named [[North Shore Albions|Devonport United]] after amalgamating with the Sunnyside League Football Club at the start of the 1920 season <ref>{{cite news \n| title =Two Clubs Amalgamate\n| page =6\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LVII| issue=17436\n| date = 1920-03-05\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19200405.2.100\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>.

The day was significant for other reasons as the teams stood in silence before the kick off out of respect for [[Bill Stormont]] (Kiwi #140) who had died two days earlier. In a July match Haddon scored a try in front of 9,000 spectators at Carlaw Park against [[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]]. Devonport won but not before Haddon was sent off along with Marist\u2019s New Zealand international [[Andrew O\u2019Brien (rugby league)|Jim O\u2019Brien]] after a \u201crough-up\u201d between the two.

On Saturday the veteran \u2026 was easily Devonport\u2019s best forward. He showed a lot of pace and some of the form displayed several years ago when playing for [[City Rovers|City]]\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = League Football Notes and Comments/The North Shore Players\n| page =6 \n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LXII, Issue 19069\n| date = 1925-07-14\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19250714.2.9.2\n| accessdate = 2020-04-14}}</ref>.

He scored a second try later in the match after a \u201cpassing rush\u201d in which all the Devonport players took part. Haddon\u2019s final ever senior league match was in a Roope Rooster semi final loss to his old City Rovers team <ref>{{cite news\n| title = League Football/City Defeat Devonport\n| page = 14\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LXII\n| date = 1925-08-17\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19250817.2.136\n| accessdate = 2020-04-14}}</ref>.\n\nIn 1926, 27, 28, and again in 1934 Haddon played in several veteran player exhibition matches. On October 30, 1926 Haddon made an appearance in an end of season game played between well known league veterans at Carlaw Park. Haddon was representing early New Zealand rugby league legends [[Albert Asher]]\u2019s team against [[William Wynyard (rugby league)|William Wynyard]]\u2019s team <ref>{{cite news\n| title = End of Season Games/Veteran Players in Action\n| page = 15\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LXIII, Issue 19473\n| date = 1926-11-01\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19261101.2.138\n| accessdate = 2020-04-14}}</ref>. The match finished 10-10 and featured the likes of [[Eric Bennett (New Zealand)|Eric Bennett]], [[Bill Davidson (rugby league)|Bill Davidson]], and [[Thomas McClymont]].

It is the town of Spa which has become [[eponym]]ous with any place having a natural water source that is believed to possess special health-giving properties, as a ''[[spa]]''.  The [[Spa town]] grew at that time, in the oldest iron and steel centre of the province of [[Liege]]. The ''ban Spa'' was created around 1335 and included two urban concentrations, ''vilhe of Creppe'' and ''vilhe'' Spas, {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=off}} away. {{citation needed|date=February 2018}} The [[steel industry]] prior to the exploitation of mineral water developed communication lines, which made it possible to develop the spa town.\n\n[[Pliny the Elder]] noted, \"In Tongrie, country of Gaul, {{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} there is a famous source, whose water, while sparkling bubbles, a ferruginous taste that is, however, feel that when we finished drinking. This water purges the body, cures fevers and dispels calculous affections.\" (C lib. XXXI VIII)\n\nIn 1559, [[Gilbert Lymborh]] wrote of \"acid fountains of the Ardennes forest and primarily those located in Spa.\" It was translated into [[Latin]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].\n\nAs early as 1547, Agustino, physician to the King of England, [[Henry VIII]], was staying at Spa and helped give knowledge to the world of the value of the Spa water. In July 1565 the gentry of the provinces met in Spa under the pretext of [[Spa town|taking the waters]].

[[File:Spa Neubois 1918 occupation Allemande.jpg|thumb|left|1918 surrender conference.]]\nDuring the Great War of 1914-1918, Spa was an important German convalescent hospital town between 1914 and 1917. The general headquarters of [[Kaiser]] [[Wilhelm II]] was, in 1918, the last place where he resided before his removal due to the German surrender. In July 1920 it hosted the [[Spa Conference of 1920|Spa Conference]], a meeting of the [[Supreme War Council|Supreme Council]]. German delegates were invited to this to discuss [[war reparations]].\n\nWorld War II saw Spa reoccupied by the Germans but the town escaped the [[Battle of the Bulge]] in 1945 that stopped, luckily for Spa, just at its gates.\n\nThe [[Marshall Plan]] helped Belgium to recover quickly. 1950 and 1960, gradually led to the development of mass tourism replacing the Spa elite as customers. These were decades of social tourism as well, with an attendance of more and more numerous Flemish and Dutch customers, while the Walloons went en masse to the Belgian coast in Flanders. Tourism relaxation replaced the thermal aspect of Spa.\n\nMay 17, 1983 to mark the 400th anniversary of the export of Spa waters,<ref>[http://www.spadel.com/ http://www.spadel.com/].</ref> HM [[King]] [[Baudouin]] visited the new facilities of the Spa Monopole SA, the Henrijean Hydrology Institute and the Thermal Establishment.

The railway line used to extend further south towards [[Trois-Ponts]], [[Vielsalm]] and [[Luxembourg]].\nLocal and regional bus services in Spa are provided by the Walloon transport company [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 R\u00e9gionale Wallonne du Transport|TEC]].\nSpa is located on the crosspoint of national roads N62, N629 and N686. The nearest motorway is the A27 ([[European route E42|E42]]), where a junction for Spa is located in the commune of [[Jalhay]].\n\n==Heraldry==\nThe [[Coat of Arms]] for Spa is a stylized pouhon housed in a neoclassical monument to the covering surrounded by a protective wall opened its facade. The monument is topped by a blue banner bearing the \"Spa-Pouhon\" inscriptions. \"Argent masonry money pouhon of sand topped with gold-SPA Pouhon inscriptions on a blue background.\" The city colours are yellow and blue. The stylized pouhon is inspired by the monument that housed the pouhon [[Peter the Great]] until 1820.\n\nUnder the [[Old Regime]], the shield was commonly used in spa towns. It was customary for the spa guests to leave their arms at the hotel where he had stayed in recognition of the benefits of the waters. At Spa, many hotels have inscriptions like \"In the Arms of [[England]]\", \"the [[Duke of Orleans]],\" \"To the King of [[Poland]]\", etc.\n\n== Climate ==\nSpa has an [[oceanic climate]] that is made more continental by its higher elevation and inland position compared to other Belgian climates at lower level or closer to the sea. Spa has a relatively high precipitation year round, with tricky weather something that the [[Spa-Francorchamps]] race track is known for. The elevation also results in cooler summers and frequent winter frost along with snowfall. Spa is quite gloomy year round although averaging both a drier and sunnier climate than nearby locations [[Stavelot#Climate|Stavelot]] and [[Malmedy#Climate|Malmedy]] that are also surrounding the race track.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Spa (1981\u20132010 normals; sunshine 1984\u20132013)\n|collapsed = \n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n|Jan record high C = \n|Feb record high C =

It is the town of Spa which has become [[eponym]]ous with any place having a natural water source that is believed to possess special health-giving properties, as a ''[[spa]]''.  The [[Spa town]] grew at that time, in the oldest iron and steel centre of the province of [[Liege]]. The ''ban Spa'' was created around 1335 and included two urban concentrations, ''vilhe of Creppe'' and ''vilhe'' Spas, {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=off}} away. {{citation needed|date=February 2018}} The [[steel industry]] prior to the exploitation of mineral water developed communication lines, which made it possible to develop the spa town.\n\n[[Pliny the Elder]] noted, \"In Tongrie, country of Gaul, {{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} there is a famous source, whose water, while sparkling bubbles, a ferruginous taste that is, however, feel that when we finished drinking. This water purges the body, cures fevers and dispels calculous affections.\" (C lib. XXXI VIII)\n\nIn 1559, [[Gilbert Lymborh]] wrote of \"acid fountains of the Ardennes forest and primarily those located in Spa.\" It was translated into [[Latin]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].\n\nAs early as 1547, Agustino, physician to the King of England, [[Henry VIII]], was staying at Spa and helped give knowledge to the world of the value of the Spa water. In July 1565 the gentry of the provinces met in Spa under the pretext of [[Spa town|taking the waters]].

A postal system between Spa and the outside world was established in 1699.\n\nSince the [[18th century]] [[casino]]s have also been located in the town.\n[[File:Spa1 gare.jpg|thumb|right|Spa Railway Station 1900]]\n\n===Twentieth century===\nIn 1918, the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] established its [[Oberste Heeresleitung|principal headquarters]] in Spa, and it was from here that the delegates set out for the French lines to meet [[Ferdinand Foch|Marshal Foch]] and sue for peace in the consultations leading up to the [[Armistice with Germany (Compi\u00e8gne)|Armistice]] which ended the [[First World War]].
