Starting from 1949 he was lecturer in aeronautical engineering at the [[Imperial College London]] of the [[University of London]], where he assumed a chair in 1955.\n\nIn 1959, Argyris was appointed a professor at the Technical University of Stuttgart (today University of Stuttgart) and director of the Institute for Statics and Dynamics of Aerospace Structures. He created the Aeronautical and Astronautical Campus of the University of Stuttgart as focal point for applications of digital computers and electronics.\n\nArgyris was involved in and developed to a large extent the Finite Element Method along with [[Ray William Clough]] and [[Olgierd Zienkiewicz]] after an early mathematical pre-working of [[Richard Courant]].\n\n==Awards and honours==\nArgyris was awarded the [[Royal Aeronautical Society]] Silver Medal in 1971.<ref>Medallist list published [http://www.aerosociety.com/Assets/Docs/Medals%20and%20Awards/HMA%20-%20List%20of%20RAeS%20Award%20Winners.pdf here].</ref>\n\nHe was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in March 1986.<ref name=\"frs\"/> His nomination reads: {{centred pull quote|Professor Argyris commenced his scientific career at Imperial College in 1949 and subsequently accepted in 1959 a joint appointment as Professor at Imperial College and Professor and Director of the Institute of Astronautical Structures at Stuttgart. Professor Argyris pioneered in the United Kingdom and Europe computer mechanics and established in the early 1950s the matrix structural theory introducing the first finite elements concepts including effects of material and [[geometry|geometrical]] [[Nonlinear system|nonlinearities]].\nThis work initiated an explosive development of [[computational mechanics]] which is still an expanding area. In this field he continued without interruption as one of the leading figures and published a prodigious number of papers (over 300) ranging in applications from structural problems through [[fluid mechanics]], lubrication, [[celestial mechanics]].

As a result, Ireland, in a report titled \"Policy Consideration for Renewable Electricity to 2010\", made the commitment to have 4% of its total energy consumption come from renewable energy resources by 2002 and 13.2% by 2010. The Department of Communications Marine and Natural Resources (DCMNR) founded the Renewable Energy Group (REG) which established the short term analysis group (STAG) to investigate a means of accomplishing this goal. To meet the 2010 target of 13.2%, 1,432&nbsp;MW of electricity will need to be generated from renewable resources with 1,100&nbsp;MW being generated from wind resources both onshore and offshore.\n\n== State financial support ==\nState financial support for the national electricity sector, and particular technologies, has been influenced by a slow move towards liberalisation, and concerns for energy security and climate change mitigation.<ref name=\":1\" /> Ireland uses an industry [[subsidy]] known as the [[Public Service Obligation]] (PSO) to support the generation of electricity from sustainable, renewable and indigenous sources, including wind.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cer.ie/docs/001034/CER15142%20PSO%20Levy%202015-16%20%20Decision%20Paper.pdf|title=PUBLIC SERVICE OBLIGATION LEVY 2015/2016|website=Cer.ie|accessdate=2017-01-15}}</ref> The PSO levy is charged to all electricity customers. As of April 2020, for residential consumers, the current PSO levy is \u20ac38.68 per year inclusive of VAT, and is displayed on the typical two-monthly electricity bill as \u20ac5.68 (\u20ac2.84 x 2) + 13.5% VAT.\n\nThe PSO levy funds the government\u2019s main mechanisms to support the generation of electricity from sustainable, renewable and indigenous sources. These mechanisms have shifted from the initial use of competitive auctions in the late 1990\u2019s, to a [[Feed-in tariff|Renewable Energy Feed-in Tariff]] (REFiT) from 2006 to 2015, and back to a new renewable energy auction scheme as of 2020. Ireland\u2019s initial use of competitive auction from 1996 failed to support the intended growth in wind development. Between 2006 and 2015, the government supported a REFiT, secured for 15 years. The 2020 REFiT reference price for large wind (>5MW) is \u20ac70.98 /MWh and for small wind (<5MW) is \u20ac73.47/MWh. In June, 2020, Ireland will run its first competitive renewable energy auction under the government\u2019s new Renewable Energy Support Scheme (RESS-1).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dccae.gov.ie/documents/RESS_1_Terms_and_Conditions.pdf|title=Ireland Renewable Energy Support Scheme: Terms and Conditions|last=|first=|date=February, 2020|website=Government of Ireland|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=3 April, 2020}}</ref> RESS-1 support is structured as a two-way Floating Feed-In Premium (FIP), roughly the difference between the \u2018strike price\u2019 set in the successful auction bid and the \u2018market reference price\u2019.

The wind farm is owned and built by [[GE Energy]] and was co-developed by [[Airtricity]] and GE Energy. The site has 7&nbsp;GE Energy 3.6&nbsp;MW turbines that generate a total of 25&nbsp;MW. The development of the site was originally divided into two phases with the first phase being the current installation of 7&nbsp;turbines. The second phase was a partnership between Airtricity and [[Acciona Energy]]. Acciona Energy had an option to buy the project after the facility is completed. The wind farm was planned to expand to 520&nbsp;MW of power. However, in 2007, Phase 2 was cancelled.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airtricity.com/assets/Uploads2/Press-Releases/Offshore-support-press-release1.pdf |title=Airtricity Welcomes Support for Offshore Wind Farm Development |website=Airtricity.com |accessdate=2017-01-15}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the waters off the Atlantic coastline of Ireland have higher winds, sites along the eastern coastline such as Arklow were chosen because of the shallower waters, which are 20 m deep or less.\n\nThe National Offshore Wind Association of Ireland (NOW Ireland) announced in April 2010 that 60,000&nbsp;potential jobs could be created in the Irish marine, construction, engineering and service industries through the development of offshore wind energy in Irish and European waters.

At present it is common to apply and obtain a 10-year permission for a wind energy development. Section 42 of the above Act originally permitted a 5-year extension of the \"appropriate period\" provided that substantial works were carried out. This caused major problems as the term \"substantial works\" was not clearly defined which resulted in a large variety in interpretation of what constituted substantial works among the various planning authorities. This issue was rectified by the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010 section 28 which inserted an additional paragraph allowing a once off extension not exceeding 5 years if \"there were considerations of a commercial, economic or technical nature beyond the control of the applicant which substantially militated against either the commencement of development or the carrying out of substantial works pursuant to the planning permission\"\n\nThe fourth issue regarding the generation of wind power is the Renewable Energy [[Feed-in Tariff]], or REFIT.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iwea.com/index.cfm/action/downloadFile/twFId/44 |format=PDF |title=Renewable Energy Feed in Tariff |website=Iwea.com |accessdate=2017-01-15}}</ref> The purpose of REFIT is to encourage development of renewable energy resources.

The Bord na Mona wind farm in Mount Lucas, Daingean, Co.Offaly has provided a local walk way through the newly established wind farm that attracts people of all ages. The walk way provides a safe environment off-road for walking, running and cycling. The walk way is approximately nine kilometres in distance with numerous stop off points for breaks. Maps can also be located in a variety of locations on the walk for guidance around the wind farm and back to allocated car parks. The walk way also provides aesthetic scenery on a relatively flat landscape. Such a walk attracts many people year round and circulates money back into the local community as tourists stop off in local shops.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.bordnamona.ie/company/our-businesses/powergen/bord-na-monas-wind-farms/ |title=Our Wind Farms |work=Bord na M\u00f3na|accessdate=1 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Grid study in Ireland===\nAn Irish study of the grid indicates that it would be feasible to accommodate 42% (of demand) renewables\nin the electricity mix.<ref name='IrishPR'>{{cite web|url=http://www.dcenr.gov.ie/Press+Releases/2008/Study+shows+Ireland+can+be+world+leader+in+renewable+energy.htm |title=Study shows Ireland can be world leader in renewable energy |accessdate=2008-10-20 |date=January 2008 |work=Department of Communications, Energy and National Resources |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321220558/http://www.dcenr.gov.ie/Press%2BReleases/2008/Study%2Bshows%2BIreland%2Bcan%2Bbe%2Bworld%2Bleader%2Bin%2Brenewable%2Benergy.htm |archivedate=21 March 2012 }}</ref>  This acceptable level of renewable penetration was found in what the study called Scenario 5, provided 47% of electrical capacity (different from demand) with the following mix of renewable energies:\n\n* 6,000 MW wind\n* 360 MW base load renewables\n* 285 MW additional variable renewables (other intermittent sources)\n\nThe study cautions that various assumptions were made that \"may have understated dispatch restrictions, resulting in an underestimation of operational costs, required wind curtailment, and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions\" and that \"The limitations of the study may overstate the technical feasibility of the portfolios analyzed...\"\n\nScenario 6, which proposed renewables providing 59% of electrical capacity and 54% of demand had problems.

The Department of Communications Marine and Natural Resources (DCMNR) founded the Renewable Energy Group (REG) which established the short term analysis group (STAG) to investigate a means of accomplishing this goal. To meet the 2010 target of 13.2%, 1,432&nbsp;MW of electricity will need to be generated from renewable resources with 1,100&nbsp;MW being generated from wind resources both onshore and offshore.\n\nThe PSO charge is in place so that money is given to companies for generating electricity from renewable sources and to help fund peat-burning stations, as neither are competitive enough without it.

The development of the site was originally divided into two phases with the first phase being the current installation of 7&nbsp;turbines. The second phase was a partnership between Airtricity and [[Acciona Energy]]. Acciona Energy had an option to buy the project after the facility is completed. The wind farm was planned to expand to 520&nbsp;MW of power.

At present it is common to apply and obtain a 10-year permission for a wind energy development. Section 42 of the above Act originally permitted a 5-year extension of the \"appropriate period\" provided that substantial works were carried out. This caused major problems as the term \"substantial works\" was not clearly defined which resulted in a large variety in interpretation of what constituted substantial works among the various planning authorities. This issue was rectified by the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010 section 28 which inserted an additional paragraph allowing a once off extension not exceeding 5 years if \"there were considerations of a commercial, economic or technical nature beyond the control of the applicant which substantially militated against either the commencement of development or the carrying out of substantial works pursuant to the planning permission\"\n\nThe fourth issue regarding the generation of wind power is the Renewable Energy [[Feed-in Tariff]], or REFIT.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iwea.com/index.cfm/action/downloadFile/twFId/44 |format=PDF |title=Renewable Energy Feed in Tariff |website=Iwea.com |accessdate=2017-01-15}}</ref> The purpose of REFIT is to encourage development of renewable energy resources.

According to this source, Zal\u0103u settlement would have been there as early as around 900{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}. Later, Zal\u0103u is referred to as ''Villa Ziloc'' in 1220, ''Zylac'' in 1246, ''Zylah'' in 1282, ''Zyloh'' and ''oppidum Zylah'' in 1318, ''Zila'' in 1601, ''Zilahu'' in 1808, ''Szil\u00e1j'' / ''Szil\u00e1gyi'' in 1839, ''Szilaju'' in 1850, and ''Zal\u0103u'' / ''Szil\u00e1ju'' / ''Walthenberg'' in 1854.\nAfter the great [[Mongol invasion]], which destroyed the city in 1241, Zal\u0103u came in 1246 under the administration of the Catholic Bishopric of [[Oradea]]. The trusteeship was maintained until 1542, when Zal\u0103u became part of [[Principality of Transylvania (1571\u20131711)|Principality of Transylvania]].\n\nOn 1 August 1473 [[Matthias Corvinus]], king of [[Hungary]] and [[Bohemia]], acknowledged Zal\u0103u as a market town for the first time (called ''[[oppidum]] Zilah'' \u2013 Zilah fort), a privilege that freed the city from the county domination, granted its citizens the right of free trade and gave it a larger degree of economic autonomy.\n\nAt the end of the 16th century, the city had an independent administrative leadership, composed of 33 elected senators (one of whom was the mayor), a notary, a registrar and a treasurer.\n\nOther important events in the development of the city occurred in 1571 during the reign of Prince [[Istvan Bathory]] and in 1600 under the reign of [[Michael the Brave]]. After Transylvania had been annexed to the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]], the city experienced an economic decline due to infusion of products from the [[Western Europe]].\n\nAfter Michael the Brave's victory in the [[Battle of Gurusl\u0103u]] on 3 August 1601, Zal\u0103u received administrative, legislative, fiscal and military own rules, which provided real autonomy freedoms to citizens. A chronicle from the 17th century, first mentioned the main crafts of city residents: belt-makers, potters, wheelwrights, shoemakers, butchers, tailors, blacksmiths, carpenters, hat makers and armorers.\n\nThe city was under the rule [[Principality of Transylvania (1571\u20131711)|Principality of Transylvania]] between 1526\u20131660. It was also controlled by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] between 1660\u20131692, the city being part of [[Varat Eyalet]].\n\nThe [[National College Silvania|Calvinist college]] was formed in the first half of the 17th century.\n\nOn 9 November 1714, [[Charles XII of Sweden]] rested for a night in a building on ''Kir\u00e1ly'' street (now named after [[Corneliu Coposu]]) with an acquaintance [[Gy\u00f6rgy Zov\u00e1nyi]] as is indicated by a notice still on the house.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.welcometoromania.ro/Zalau/Zalau_Casa_Zovanyi_e.htm |title=Zal\u0103u, Zov\u00e1nyi house |publisher=Welcometoromania.ro |accessdate=30 September 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118040159/http://www.welcometoromania.ro/Zalau/Zalau_Casa_Zovanyi_e.htm |archive-date=18 January 2012 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nUntil the administrative reform of 1876, the city had been the seat of [[K\u00f6z\u00e9p-Szolnok]] for centuries.\n\n=== Modern times ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2011}}\nZal\u0103u is one of the most important urban centers in the region. It had a [[National College Silvania|Reformed college]] (Wessel\u00e9nyi college), a township school for civil service (for boys only), and a national civil school (for girls only). It had the largest hospital in the region and a tax revenue office.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}\n\nIn 1850, it held a population of 4,294 and, in 1910\u20148,062 (7,477 Hungarians, 19 Germans, 529 Romanians and 23 belonging to other ethnic groups). By religion, there were 1,333 [[Roman Catholics]], 873 [[Greek Catholics]], 5,363 members of the Reformed Church, and 415 [[Jews]]. The city had 1,427 households, and most of its inhabitants were employed by the manufacturing industry. The [[Reformed Church, Zal\u0103u|Reformed church]] was built in 1246. It is one of the city's oldest buildings and one of the largest in [[Eastern Europe]].\n\nIn 1876, Zal\u0103u became the seat of the [[Szil\u00e1gy County]]. After the proclamation of the [[Union of Transylvania with Romania]] (1918), by the [[Treaty of Trianon]] Zal\u0103u has been part of [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] \u2013 except between 1940 until the end of [[World War II]], when [[Northern Transylvania]] became part of [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131946)|Hungary]] as a result of the [[Second Vienna Award]]. On 8 September 1940, upon arrival in Zal\u0103u , the Hungarian Army killed 11 people just outside the city;<ref>[[Magazin s\u0103l\u0103jean]], [http://www.magazinsalajean.ro/index.php?cmd=article&artid=8338 Ceremonii comemorative la Treznea \u0219i Ip]</ref> and the [[Treznea massacre]] occurred in the nearby village of [[Cium\u0103rna]] on the next day.\n\nBetween 1892\u20131896, one of the most famous Hungarian poets [[Endre Ady]] attended the [[National College Silvania|Protestant school]] in Zal\u0103u (since 1957, there has been a statue of Endre Ady in front of the school). The poet also published his first poem in the local newspaper \"[[Szil\u00e1gy (newspaper)|Szil\u00e1gy]]\" on 22 March 1896. A memorial plaque on the frontage of the building where he lived reminiscents of Ady Endre\u2019s time spent there.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, [[Lajos Szikszai]] donated his private collection to the municipality and the first museum in Zal\u0103u was created. An exhibition was also organized in 1926, but the [[Zal\u0103u County Museum]] was officially inaugurated in 1951. On 9 July 1981, a new section of the [[Zal\u0103u County Museum]] was inaugurated and was named the \"[[Ioan Sima]]\" Arts Gallery.\n\nThe \"Central Library,\" owning 7,000 Romanian and Hungarian books, was opened on the 23 the August 1950. In 1952 it became \"District Library,\" coordinating all the [[Zal\u0103u District]] libraries. In 1957 it took the name of [[Ioni\u021b\u0103 Scipione B\u0103descu]]. It became the \"County Library\" with the administrative reform of February 1968.\n\nAs of the end of the 1960s, the city became a regional industrial center for the first time, which was heavily impacted by the [[Systematization|Systematization process]]. Industrial factories like Arm\u0103tura Zal\u0103u, [[Silcotub Zal\u0103u]] and Anvelope Silvania (recently bought by [[Michelin]]) hired thousands of workers, which sparked an increase in population as a result. The population influx gradually led to changes in the ethnic structure with the Romanians being now the majority and the Hungarians reduced to a minority. However, in many of the surrounding communes, the ethnic structure still remained unchanged (for example [[V\u00e2r\u0219ol\u021b]]) are still populated by Hungarians; on the other hand, nearby villages such as [[Crasna, S\u0103laj|Marin]] have a 100% ethnic Romanian population, basically unchanged for more than a century. In the 1970s with the working-class population expanding, housing estates of high-rise blocks of flats were built in both the centre and the outskirts of the town. \n\nIn 2007, due to the negligence of the local natural gas distributor, a gas accumulation [[Zal\u0103u explosion|produced an explosion]] that led to casualties and significant material damage.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.magazinsalajean.ro/eveniment/zece-ani-de-la-explozia-blocului-e24 |title=Zece ani de la explozia blocului E24 |publisher=magazinsalajean.ro |date=18 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nToday Zal\u0103u is crossed by European road [[European route E81|E81]] and the national road [[DN 1F]]. A new motorway ([[A3 (Romania)|Transylvania Highway]]) is being built to connect Zal\u0103u to Western Europe. The town has two nationally accredited University colleges, a public library, one [[Zal\u0103u County Museum|museum]], an [[Zal\u0103u County Museum|art gallery]], more than four hotels, a motel, and two student halls of residence.\n\n== Geography ==\nZal\u0103u lies in the Zal\u0103u Valley, at the junction of the [[Apuseni]] mountains and the [[Eastern Carpathians]], in [[S\u0103laj County]], at {{coord|47|12|N|23|3|E}}. Zal\u0103u is in the central part of [[S\u0103laj County]], in [[Zal\u0103u (river)|Zal\u0103u]] watershed where the depression of the same name and the Mese\u0219 Peak meet.\n\nIt neighbours [[Maramure\u0219 historical region|\u021aara Maramure\u0219ului]] and the [[Satu Mare County|county of Satu Mare]], in the northwestern part of the historical region of [[Transylvania]], which in the past was a mainly independent small state but since 1918 has belonged to [[Romania]] (except between September 1940 and October 1944, when it was under the administration of [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131946)|Hungary]] following the [[Second Vienna Award]]). Whether Zal\u0103u lies in Cri\u0219ana or Transylvania is still a matter of debate because, geographically, Zal\u0103u lies on the eastern border of Cri\u0219ana.\n\nIt lies along the bank of the small river [[Zal\u0103u (river)|Zal\u0103u]], between three narrow valleys in the [[Mese\u0219 Mountains]]. It is the county seat and the largest city in [[S\u0103laj County]].\n\nThe city includes a total surface of {{convert|90.09|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}. This includes the one village it administers, St\u00e2na (''Fels\u0151ny\u00e1rl\u00f3''), situated south-east of Mese\u0219, in the hydrographic basin of [[Agrij]]. M\u0103gura St\u00e2nii has {{convert|716|m|ft|abbr=on}}.\n\n== Sights ==\nThe most important of the 24 monuments and buildings in the county capital of Zal\u0103u are: \"[[Transylvania Theater, Zal\u0103u|Transilvania]]\" (theatre in 1895), the city hall (court and seat of the prefects office in 1889), the [[Catholic Church, Zal\u0103u|Roman Catholic Church]] (1878), the [[Reformed Church in Romania|reformed church]] (1904\u20131907), the [[Greek Catholic]] church \"[[Assumption Cathedral, Zal\u0103u|Adormirea Maicii Domnului]]\" (1930\u20131934), the Orthodox deanery (built in the late 19th century), the [[Zal\u0103u County Museum|Historical Museum]] (built about 1900 \u2013 casino of the artisans fellowship), the [[Simion B\u0103rnu\u021biu School, Zal\u0103u|primary school \"Simion B\u0103rnu\u021biu\"]] (girls' school in 1895) and the [[National College Silvania]] (Reformed College in 1860), all these being valuable urbanistic elements for the historical and cultural patrimony of the land. The famous statuary group [[Wessel\u00e9nyi Monument]] of the heroic Hungarian nobleman with the same name (1902) by [[J\u00e1nos Fadrusz]], and the bust made in the honour of [[Simion B\u0103rnu\u021biu]] by [[Romul Ladea]] are worth visiting as well.\n\nZal\u0103u hosts lively pageants each year, including a summer festival known as the \"Zal\u0103u Days\". There is a [[Wessel\u00e9nyi Monument|statue]] of [[Mikl\u00f3s Wessel\u00e9nyi|Baron Wessel\u00e9nyi]] in [[Iuliu Maniu Square]] of the town center; the [[Tuhutum Monument|Tuhutum Memorial]] (both made by [[J\u00e1nos Fadrusz]] in 1902); the [[Zal\u0103u County Museum|Zal\u0103u County Museum of History and Art]] displays artifacts ranging from neolithic times to modern times, with a focus on the Roman period and hosts works of modern art. There are several churches, including the [[Reformed Church, Zal\u0103u|Calvinist cathedral]], which is one of the most beautiful and largest in Transylvania.\n\n== Population ==\nThe population of Zal\u0103u went through important evolutions throughout times (see above), and at present the data indicated by the 2011 census are the following: 56,202 inhabitants.<ref name=census11>[http://www.recensamantromania.ro/rezultate-2/ Tab8.

According to this source, Zal\u0103u settlement would have been there as early as around 900{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}. Later, Zal\u0103u is referred to as ''Villa Ziloc'' in 1220, ''Zylac'' in 1246, ''Zylah'' in 1282, ''Zyloh'' and ''oppidum Zylah'' in 1318, ''Zila'' in 1601, ''Zilahu'' in 1808, ''Szil\u00e1j'' / ''Szil\u00e1gyi'' in 1839, ''Szilaju'' in 1850, and ''Zal\u0103u'' / ''Szil\u00e1ju'' / ''Walthenberg'' in 1854.\nAfter the great [[Mongol invasion]], which destroyed the city in 1241, Zal\u0103u came in 1246 under the administration of the Catholic Bishopric of [[Oradea]]. The trusteeship was maintained until 1542, when Zal\u0103u became part of [[Principality of Transylvania (1571\u20131711)|Principality of Transylvania]].\n\nOn 1 August 1473 [[Matthias Corvinus]], king of [[Hungary]] and [[Bohemia]], acknowledged Zal\u0103u as a market town for the first time (called ''[[oppidum]] Zilah'' \u2013 Zilah fort), a privilege that freed the city from the county domination, granted its citizens the right of free trade and gave it a larger degree of economic autonomy.\n\nAt the end of the 16th century, the city had an independent administrative leadership, composed of 33 elected senators (one of whom was the mayor), a notary, a registrar and a treasurer.\n\nOther important events in the development of the city occurred in 1571 during the reign of Prince [[Istvan Bathory]] and in 1600 under the reign of [[Michael the Brave]]. After Transylvania had been annexed to the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]], the city experienced an economic decline due to infusion of products from the [[Western Europe]].\n\nAfter Michael the Brave's victory in the [[Battle of Gurusl\u0103u]] on 3 August 1601, Zal\u0103u received administrative, legislative, fiscal and military own rules, which provided real autonomy freedoms to citizens. A chronicle from the 17th century, first mentioned the main crafts of city residents: belt-makers, potters, wheelwrights, shoemakers, butchers, tailors, blacksmiths, carpenters, hat makers and armorers.\n\nThe city was under the rule [[Principality of Transylvania (1571\u20131711)|Principality of Transylvania]] between 1526\u20131660. It was also controlled by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] between 1660\u20131692, the city being part of [[Varat Eyalet]].\n\nThe [[National College Silvania|Calvinist college]] was formed in the first half of the 17th century.\n\nOn 9 November 1714, [[Charles XII of Sweden]] rested for a night in a building on ''Kir\u00e1ly'' street (now named after [[Corneliu Coposu]]) with an acquaintance [[Gy\u00f6rgy Zov\u00e1nyi]] as is indicated by a notice still on the house.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.welcometoromania.ro/Zalau/Zalau_Casa_Zovanyi_e.htm |title=Zal\u0103u, Zov\u00e1nyi house |publisher=Welcometoromania.ro |accessdate=30 September 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118040159/http://www.welcometoromania.ro/Zalau/Zalau_Casa_Zovanyi_e.htm |archive-date=18 January 2012 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nUntil the administrative reform of 1876, the city had been the seat of [[K\u00f6z\u00e9p-Szolnok]] for centuries.\n\n=== Modern times ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2011}}\nZal\u0103u is one of the most important urban centers in the region. It had a [[National College Silvania|Reformed college]] (Wessel\u00e9nyi college), a township school for civil service (for boys only), and a national civil school (for girls only). It had the largest hospital in the region and a tax revenue office.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}\n\nIn 1850, it held a population of 4,294 and, in 1910\u20148,062 (7,477 Hungarians, 19 Germans, 529 Romanians and 23 belonging to other ethnic groups). By religion, there were 1,333 [[Roman Catholics]], 873 [[Greek Catholics]], 5,363 members of the Reformed Church, and 415 [[Jews]]. The city had 1,427 households, and most of its inhabitants were employed by the manufacturing industry. The [[Reformed Church, Zal\u0103u|Reformed church]] was built in 1246. It is one of the city's oldest buildings and one of the largest in [[Eastern Europe]].\n\nIn 1876, Zal\u0103u became the seat of the [[Szil\u00e1gy County]]. After the proclamation of the [[Union of Transylvania with Romania]] (1918), by the [[Treaty of Trianon]] Zal\u0103u has been part of [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] \u2013 except between 1940 until the end of [[World War II]], when [[Northern Transylvania]] became part of [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131946)|Hungary]] as a result of the [[Second Vienna Award]]. On 8 September 1940, upon arrival in Zal\u0103u , the Hungarian Army killed 11 people just outside the city;<ref>[[Magazin s\u0103l\u0103jean]], [http://www.magazinsalajean.ro/index.php?cmd=article&artid=8338 Ceremonii comemorative la Treznea \u0219i Ip]</ref> and the [[Treznea massacre]] occurred in the nearby village of [[Cium\u0103rna]] on the next day.\n\nBetween 1892\u20131896, one of the most famous Hungarian poets [[Endre Ady]] attended the [[National College Silvania|Protestant school]] in Zal\u0103u (since 1957, there has been a statue of Endre Ady in front of the school). The poet also published his first poem in the local newspaper \"[[Szil\u00e1gy (newspaper)|Szil\u00e1gy]]\" on 22 March 1896. A memorial plaque on the frontage of the building where he lived reminiscents of Ady Endre\u2019s time spent there.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, [[Lajos Szikszai]] donated his private collection to the municipality and the first museum in Zal\u0103u was created. An exhibition was also organized in 1926, but the [[Zal\u0103u County Museum]] was officially inaugurated in 1951. On 9 July 1981, a new section of the [[Zal\u0103u County Museum]] was inaugurated and was named the \"[[Ioan Sima]]\" Arts Gallery.\n\nThe \"Central Library,\" owning 7,000 Romanian and Hungarian books, was opened on the 23 the August 1950. In 1952 it became \"District Library,\" coordinating all the [[Zal\u0103u District]] libraries. In 1957 it took the name of [[Ioni\u021b\u0103 Scipione B\u0103descu]]. It became the \"County Library\" with the administrative reform of February 1968.\n\nAs of the end of the 1960s, the city became a regional industrial center for the first time, which was heavily impacted by the [[Systematization|Systematization process]]. Industrial factories like Arm\u0103tura Zal\u0103u, [[Silcotub Zal\u0103u]] and Anvelope Silvania (recently bought by [[Michelin]]) hired thousands of workers, which sparked an increase in population as a result. The population influx gradually led to changes in the ethnic structure with the Romanians being now the majority and the Hungarians reduced to a minority. However, in many of the surrounding communes, the ethnic structure still remained unchanged (for example [[V\u00e2r\u0219ol\u021b]]) are still populated by Hungarians; on the other hand, nearby villages such as [[Crasna, S\u0103laj|Marin]] have a 100% ethnic Romanian population, basically unchanged for more than a century. In the 1970s with the working-class population expanding, housing estates of high-rise blocks of flats were built in both the centre and the outskirts of the town. \n\nIn 2007, due to the negligence of the local natural gas distributor, a gas accumulation [[Zal\u0103u explosion|produced an explosion]] that led to casualties and significant material damage.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.magazinsalajean.ro/eveniment/zece-ani-de-la-explozia-blocului-e24 |title=Zece ani de la explozia blocului E24 |publisher=magazinsalajean.ro |date=18 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nToday Zal\u0103u is crossed by European road [[European route E81|E81]] and the national road [[DN 1F]]. A new motorway ([[A3 (Romania)|Transylvania Highway]]) is being built to connect Zal\u0103u to Western Europe. The town has two nationally accredited University colleges, a public library, one [[Zal\u0103u County Museum|museum]], an [[Zal\u0103u County Museum|art gallery]], more than four hotels, a motel, and two student halls of residence.\n\n== Geography ==\nZal\u0103u lies in the Zal\u0103u Valley, at the junction of the [[Apuseni]] mountains and the [[Eastern Carpathians]], in [[S\u0103laj County]], at {{coord|47|12|N|23|3|E}}. Zal\u0103u is in the central part of [[S\u0103laj County]], in [[Zal\u0103u (river)|Zal\u0103u]] watershed where the depression of the same name and the Mese\u0219 Peak meet.\n\nIt neighbours [[Maramure\u0219 historical region|\u021aara Maramure\u0219ului]] and the [[Satu Mare County|county of Satu Mare]], in the northwestern part of the historical region of [[Transylvania]], which in the past was a mainly independent small state but since 1918 has belonged to [[Romania]] (except between September 1940 and October 1944, when it was under the administration of [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131946)|Hungary]] following the [[Second Vienna Award]]). Whether Zal\u0103u lies in Cri\u0219ana or Transylvania is still a matter of debate because, geographically, Zal\u0103u lies on the eastern border of Cri\u0219ana.\n\nIt lies along the bank of the small river [[Zal\u0103u (river)|Zal\u0103u]], between three narrow valleys in the [[Mese\u0219 Mountains]]. It is the county seat and the largest city in [[S\u0103laj County]].\n\nThe city includes a total surface of {{convert|90.09|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}. This includes the one village it administers, St\u00e2na (''Fels\u0151ny\u00e1rl\u00f3''), situated south-east of Mese\u0219, in the hydrographic basin of [[Agrij]]. M\u0103gura St\u00e2nii has {{convert|716|m|ft|abbr=on}}.\n\n== Sights ==\nThe most important of the 24 monuments and buildings in the county capital of Zal\u0103u are: \"[[Transylvania Theater, Zal\u0103u|Transilvania]]\" (theatre in 1895), the city hall (court and seat of the prefects office in 1889), the [[Catholic Church, Zal\u0103u|Roman Catholic Church]] (1878), the [[Reformed Church in Romania|reformed church]] (1904\u20131907), the [[Greek Catholic]] church \"[[Assumption Cathedral, Zal\u0103u|Adormirea Maicii Domnului]]\" (1930\u20131934), the Orthodox deanery (built in the late 19th century), the [[Zal\u0103u County Museum|Historical Museum]] (built about 1900 \u2013 casino of the artisans fellowship), the [[Simion B\u0103rnu\u021biu School, Zal\u0103u|primary school \"Simion B\u0103rnu\u021biu\"]] (girls' school in 1895) and the [[National College Silvania]] (Reformed College in 1860), all these being valuable urbanistic elements for the historical and cultural patrimony of the land. The famous statuary group [[Wessel\u00e9nyi Monument]] of the heroic Hungarian nobleman with the same name (1902) by [[J\u00e1nos Fadrusz]], and the bust made in the honour of [[Simion B\u0103rnu\u021biu]] by [[Romul Ladea]] are worth visiting as well.\n\nZal\u0103u hosts lively pageants each year, including a summer festival known as the \"Zal\u0103u Days\". There is a [[Wessel\u00e9nyi Monument|statue]] of [[Mikl\u00f3s Wessel\u00e9nyi|Baron Wessel\u00e9nyi]] in [[Iuliu Maniu Square]] of the town center; the [[Tuhutum Monument|Tuhutum Memorial]] (both made by [[J\u00e1nos Fadrusz]] in 1902); the [[Zal\u0103u County Museum|Zal\u0103u County Museum of History and Art]] displays artifacts ranging from neolithic times to modern times, with a focus on the Roman period and hosts works of modern art. There are several churches, including the [[Reformed Church, Zal\u0103u|Calvinist cathedral]], which is one of the most beautiful and largest in Transylvania.\n\n== Population ==\nThe population of Zal\u0103u went through important evolutions throughout times (see above), and at present the data indicated by the 2011 census are the following: 56,202 inhabitants.<ref name=census11>[http://www.recensamantromania.ro/rezultate-2/ Tab8.

His later poetry, from the collection ''Spill Out'' (1967) took on a more ironic stance, but still vernacular rather than academic. Of his novels, ''The Net'' (1952, set in an aeronautical research station) and ''Thin Air'' (1961) were well received.<ref name=times/> Between 1949 and 1963 he edited an annual anthology called ''Pick of Today's Short Stories''.\n\n==Private Life==\nOn 30 October 1934 Pudney married Crystal Selwyn Herbert,<ref>[http://www.warpoets.org/conflicts/ww2/pudney/ John Pudney (1909 - 1977) - The War Poets Association] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130417054114/http://www.warpoets.org/conflicts/ww2/pudney/ |date=17 April 2013 }}</ref> the daughter of [[A.
