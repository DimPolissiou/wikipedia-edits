The routes primarily run along [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]], [[Fifth Avenue (Manhattan)|Fifth]] and [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Sixth Avenues]], and [[Riverside Drive (Manhattan)|Riverside Drive]] from [[South Ferry (Manhattan)|South Ferry]], [[Lower Manhattan]] to [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]]. The M5 covers the northern portion of the route north of 31st Street, while the M55 operates along the southern portion of the route south of 44th Street. The two routes overlap in [[Midtown Manhattan]]. The portion along Broadway south of East 8th Street was originally a [[streetcar line]].\n\nThe whole line was a single route, the M5, until January 2017, when the M55 was created.\n\n==Route description==\n===Broadway Line===\nThe Broadway line began at [[Columbus Circle]]. It runs east along [[Central Park South]] one block, and turned right onto [[Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)|Seventh Avenue]]. It followed Seventh to Times Square, and bore left on Broadway. It followed Broadway to [[Madison Square]], and bore right onto Fifth Avenue. It ran on Fifth along with the [[Madison and Fifth Avenue buses|Fifth/Madison Avenue Line]] to 8th Street. Both lines turned left onto East 8th Street (also known as St. Marks Place) east towards Broadway. At Broadway, the Broadway line turned right and terminated at the South Ferry; the Fifth/Madison Avenue Line continued to Fourth Avenue and terminated at Astor Place and Fourth Avenue.\n\n===Current alignment===\n[[File:RTS 5222 M55.jpg|thumb|left|An M55 [[Nova Bus|Nova Bus RTS-06]] bus at its northern terminal in Midtown.]]\nThe current M5 and M55 follow a similar route, except the M55 does not run on Broadway north of St. Marks Place after the pedestrian plazas were implemented.\n\nThe current northbound M55 route begins at South Ferry and runs uptown on Church Street and Sixth Avenue. Downtown M55 buses run along Fifth Avenue to East 8th Street, where the route cuts over to Broadway and terminates at South Ferry. The northbound M55 runs along Fifth and Sixth Avenues until 44th Street, where it terminates.<ref name=\"schedule2\">{{cite NYC bus|M55}}</ref>\n\nThe M5 starts at 31st Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues, using Sixth Avenue northbound and Fifth Avenue southbound until it reaches Central Park South. This corridor is shared by the [[Fifth and Madison Avenues Line|M1, M2, M3 and M4]] routes, and Sixth Avenue with the [[Columbus Avenue Line|M7.]] There, the M5 runs crosstown along Central Park South (West 59th Street) and uptown along Broadway from Columbus Circle to West 72nd Street, where it crosses over to the southern terminus of Riverside Drive. This Broadway section is shared by the M7 and M104, and 72nd Street is shared by the street's M72 crosstown bus route, as well as the M57. The route shifts to Riverside Drive, parallel to Broadway and runs the entire length of the street. This portion is not served by any other bus route. At 135th Street, the bus route goes back to Broadway, where it meets the M4 route, and continues up that street until Fort Washington Avenue, where the M4 shifts on that street to head to [[The Cloisters]] while the M5 continues up Broadway until the [[George Washington Bridge Bus Station]] at 178th Street.<ref name=\"schedule\">{{cite NYC bus|M5}}</ref>\n\nThe M5 Limited, which operates during the daytime, runs limited between 135th and 157th Streets, as well as between 72nd and 31st Streets. Elsewhere, all limited buses make local stops. When the M5 Limited is running, there is no M5 local service.<ref name=\"schedule\"/> The M55 runs local at all times.<ref name=\"schedule2\"/>\n\nThe M2, M3, M4, M5 and M104 are based out of [[Manhattanville Depot]], while the M1 and M7 are based out of [[Mother Clara Hale Depot]] and the M55 out of [[Michael J. Quill Depot|Michael J Quill Depot]].\n\n==History==\n\n=== Streetcar service ===\n[[Image:broadwaytrolley.jpg|thumbnail|left|300px|Getting on the Broadway trolley at Herald Square]]\nThe [[Broadway and Seventh Avenue Railroad]] opened a line from Lower Manhattan to Central Park in 1864. However, south of [[Union Square, Manhattan|Union Square]], tracks were not allowed in Broadway due to local opposition. Thus the route began in the trackage west of [[City Hall, Manhattan|City Hall]], jointly owned by the [[Sixth Avenue Railroad]] and [[Eighth Avenue Railroad]], and used the [[one-way pair]] of [[Church Street (Manhattan)|Church Street]] and [[West Broadway (Manhattan)|West Broadway]]<!--which was northbound?--> to [[Canal Street (Manhattan)|Canal Street]] and [[Greene Street (Manhattan)|Greene Street]] and [[Wooster Street (Manhattan)|Wooster Street]]<!--same question--> to [[8th Street (Manhattan)|8th Street]], north of which both directions used [[University Place (Manhattan)|University Place]] to Union Square. North of Union Square, tracks were built in Broadway to north of [[Times Square]], where it merged with the Broadway and Seventh Avenue Railroad's other line, along Seventh Avenue, to end at Seventh Avenue and [[59th Street (Manhattan)|59th Street]].\n\nOn May 8, 1884, [[Jacob Sharp (railroader)|Jacob Sharp]], the owner of the Broadway and Seventh Avenue Railroad, incorporated the '''Broadway Surface Railroad''' to run along Broadway from Union Square south to the [[Bowling Green, Manhattan|Bowling Green]]. It opened in 1885, and was leased to the Broadway and Seventh Avenue Railroad. A [[Cable car (railway)|cable]] was installed on May 1, 1893, and the [[Lexington Avenue Line (surface)|Lexington Avenue Line]] and [[Broadway and Columbus Avenue Line]] were also operated by cable as branches. The Broadway Line was [[electrified (rail)|electrified]] with [[conduit electrification|conduit]] in May 1901.\n\nThe Broadway and Seventh Avenue Railroad was leased by the [[Houston, West Street and Pavonia Ferry Railroad]] on June 30, 1893, and the lessee merged with the Broadway Surface Railroad and [[South Ferry Railroad]] on November 29, 1893 to form the [[Metropolitan Street Railway]]. Buses were substituted for streetcars by the [[New York City Omnibus Corporation]] on March 6, 1936, as route number 6. That company changed its name to [[Fifth Avenue Coach Lines]] in 1956; the [[Manhattan and Bronx Surface Transit Operating Authority]] took over operations in 1962.\n\n=== Reroutes along north-south avenues ===\nWhen Broadway from [[34th Street (Manhattan)|34th Street]] to [[Columbus Circle]], Sixth Avenue from 34th Street to 59th Street, and Seventh Avenue from Times Square to 59th Street became [[one-way street]]s on March 10, 1957, the Broadway-Seventh Avenue route 6's northbound route was shifted to Sixth Avenue between 34th and 59th Streets.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1957/03/11/archives/midtown-gets-new-traffic-pattern-oneway-plan-starts-smoothlybig.html|title=Midtown Gets New Traffic Pattern; One-Way Plan Starts Smoothly - Big Test Will Come Today|last=Ingraham|first=Joseph C.|date=1957-03-11|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-02-06|url-status=live|pages=1, 22|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>  When several lower Manhattan streets were converted to one-way traffic on June 3, 1962, the 6's northbound path in the area was rearranged to travel along [[Greenwich Street (Manhattan)|Greenwich Street]], Trinity Place and [[Church Street (Manhattan)|Church Street]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1962/05/28/archives/barnes-to-speed-downtown-flow-new-oneway-designations-on-the-west.html|title=Barnes to Speed Downtown Flow; New One-Way Designations on the West Side to Go Into Effect on Sunday|last=Stengren|first=Bernard|date=1962-05-28|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-02-06|url-status=live|page=33|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>  Following the one-way conversions of Sixth Avenue below 34th Street to one-way northbound, and of Broadway between 34th and 23rd Streets and between 14th and Canal Streets to one-way southbound, on November 10, 1963, the NYCO's Sixth Avenue bus (numbered 5) was discontinued and absorbed into the 6, now designated the '''Broadway-Seventh Avenue-Avenue of the Americas Line''', and later [[Sixth Avenue Line (Manhattan surface)|M6]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1963/11/05/archives/city-to-extend-oneway-traffic-to-3-manhattan-routes-sunday-broadway.html|title=City to Extend One-Way Traffic To 3 Manhattan Routes Sunday; Broadway, Sixth Avenue and Lafayette Involved|last=|first=|date=1963-11-05|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-02-06|url-status=live|page=1|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>[[File:MTA New York City Bus DesignLine EcoSaver IV (2009).jpg|thumb|right|An M5 [[DesignLine Corporation|DesignLine EcoSaver IV]] bus in 2009 at LaGuardia Place in Greenwich Village, its terminus from 1963 to 2010; the bus has since been retired.]]Meanwhile, the [[Fifth Avenue Coach Company]] had been operating its own route 5, the '''Fifth Avenue\u2013Riverside Drive''' line, since August 5, 1900.  For decades up to the 1962 MABSTOA takeover, its route largely held the same:  running from [[168th Street (Manhattan)|168th Street]] \u2013 [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]] to [[Washington Square Park]], traveling through Fifth Avenue south of [[57th Street (Manhattan)|57th Street]], then turning onto [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] through Columbus Circle, turning at [[72nd Street (Manhattan)|72nd Street]] towards [[Riverside Drive (Manhattan)|Riverside Drive]] on its way to its northern terminus.  The only change in the route path was following Broadway's conversion to [[one-way street|one-way]] southbound between Columbus Circle and [[Herald Square]] in 1957, requiring the northbound 5 to turn at 57th Street onto [[Eighth Avenue (Manhattan)|Eighth Avenue]] en route to Columbus Circle.<ref>\"Fifth Avenue Coach Company.\"  ''Motor Coach Age'', July 1971.</ref>\n\n=== Bus service ===\nIn the first decade following MABSTOA's 1962 takeover of all Fifth Avenue Coach and [[Surface Transportation Corporation|Surface Transit]] lines, several changes to the M5's route were made.

The routes primarily run along [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]], [[Fifth Avenue (Manhattan)|Fifth]] and [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Sixth Avenues]], and [[Riverside Drive (Manhattan)|Riverside Drive]] from [[South Ferry (Manhattan)|South Ferry]], [[Lower Manhattan]] to [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]]. The M5 covers the northern portion of the route north of 31st Street, while the M55 operates along the southern portion of the route south of 44th Street. The two routes overlap in [[Midtown Manhattan]]. The portion along Broadway south of East 8th Street was originally a [[streetcar line]].\n\nThe whole line was a single route, the M5, until January 2017, when the M55 was created.\n\n==Route description==\n===Broadway Line===\nThe Broadway line began at [[Columbus Circle]]. It runs east along [[Central Park South]] one block, and turned right onto [[Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)|Seventh Avenue]]. It followed Seventh to Times Square, and bore left on Broadway. It followed Broadway to [[Madison Square]], and bore right onto Fifth Avenue. It ran on Fifth along with the [[Madison and Fifth Avenue buses|Fifth/Madison Avenue Line]] to 8th Street. Both lines turned left onto East 8th Street (also known as St. Marks Place) east towards Broadway. At Broadway, the Broadway line turned right and terminated at the South Ferry; the Fifth/Madison Avenue Line continued to Fourth Avenue and terminated at Astor Place and Fourth Avenue.\n\n===Current alignment===\n[[File:RTS 5222 M55.jpg|thumb|left|An M55 [[Nova Bus|Nova Bus RTS-06]] bus at its northern terminal in Midtown.]]\nThe current M5 and M55 follow a similar route, except the M55 does not run on Broadway north of St. Marks Place after the pedestrian plazas were implemented.\n\nThe current northbound M55 route begins at South Ferry and runs uptown on Church Street and Sixth Avenue. Downtown M55 buses run along Fifth Avenue to East 8th Street, where the route cuts over to Broadway and terminates at South Ferry. The northbound M55 runs along Fifth and Sixth Avenues until 44th Street, where it terminates.<ref name=\"schedule2\">{{cite NYC bus|M55}}</ref>\n\nThe M5 starts at 31st Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues, using Sixth Avenue northbound and Fifth Avenue southbound until it reaches Central Park South. This corridor is shared by the [[Fifth and Madison Avenues Line|M1, M2, M3 and M4]] routes, and Sixth Avenue with the [[Columbus Avenue Line|M7.]] There, the M5 runs crosstown along Central Park South (West 59th Street) and uptown along Broadway from Columbus Circle to West 72nd Street, where it crosses over to the southern terminus of Riverside Drive. This Broadway section is shared by the M7 and M104, and 72nd Street is shared by the street's M72 crosstown bus route, as well as the M57. The route shifts to Riverside Drive, parallel to Broadway and runs the entire length of the street. This portion is not served by any other bus route. At 135th Street, the bus route goes back to Broadway, where it meets the M4 route, and continues up that street until Fort Washington Avenue, where the M4 shifts on that street to head to [[The Cloisters]] while the M5 continues up Broadway until the [[George Washington Bridge Bus Station]] at 178th Street.<ref name=\"schedule\">{{cite NYC bus|M5}}</ref>\n\nThe M5 Limited, which operates during the daytime, runs limited between 135th and 157th Streets, as well as between 72nd and 31st Streets. Elsewhere, all limited buses make local stops. When the M5 Limited is running, there is no M5 local service.<ref name=\"schedule\"/> The M55 runs local at all times.<ref name=\"schedule2\"/>\n\nThe M2, M3, M4, M5 and M104 are based out of [[Manhattanville Depot]], while the M1 and M7 are based out of [[Mother Clara Hale Depot]] and the M55 out of [[Michael J. Quill Depot|Michael J Quill Depot]].\n\n==History==\n\n=== Streetcar service ===\n[[Image:broadwaytrolley.jpg|thumbnail|left|300px|Getting on the Broadway trolley at Herald Square]]\nThe [[Broadway and Seventh Avenue Railroad]] opened a line from Lower Manhattan to Central Park in 1864. However, south of [[Union Square, Manhattan|Union Square]], tracks were not allowed in Broadway due to local opposition. Thus the route began in the trackage west of [[City Hall, Manhattan|City Hall]], jointly owned by the [[Sixth Avenue Railroad]] and [[Eighth Avenue Railroad]], and used the [[one-way pair]] of [[Church Street (Manhattan)|Church Street]] and [[West Broadway (Manhattan)|West Broadway]]<!--which was northbound?--> to [[Canal Street (Manhattan)|Canal Street]] and [[Greene Street (Manhattan)|Greene Street]] and [[Wooster Street (Manhattan)|Wooster Street]]<!--same question--> to [[8th Street (Manhattan)|8th Street]], north of which both directions used [[University Place (Manhattan)|University Place]] to Union Square. North of Union Square, tracks were built in Broadway to north of [[Times Square]], where it merged with the Broadway and Seventh Avenue Railroad's other line, along Seventh Avenue, to end at Seventh Avenue and [[59th Street (Manhattan)|59th Street]].\n\nOn May 8, 1884, [[Jacob Sharp (railroader)|Jacob Sharp]], the owner of the Broadway and Seventh Avenue Railroad, incorporated the '''Broadway Surface Railroad''' to run along Broadway from Union Square south to the [[Bowling Green, Manhattan|Bowling Green]]. It opened in 1885, and was leased to the Broadway and Seventh Avenue Railroad. A [[Cable car (railway)|cable]] was installed on May 1, 1893, and the [[Lexington Avenue Line (surface)|Lexington Avenue Line]] and [[Broadway and Columbus Avenue Line]] were also operated by cable as branches. The Broadway Line was [[electrified (rail)|electrified]] with [[conduit electrification|conduit]] in May 1901.\n\nThe Broadway and Seventh Avenue Railroad was leased by the [[Houston, West Street and Pavonia Ferry Railroad]] on June 30, 1893, and the lessee merged with the Broadway Surface Railroad and [[South Ferry Railroad]] on November 29, 1893 to form the [[Metropolitan Street Railway]]. Buses were substituted for streetcars by the [[New York City Omnibus Corporation]] on March 6, 1936, as route number 6. That company changed its name to [[Fifth Avenue Coach Lines]] in 1956; the [[Manhattan and Bronx Surface Transit Operating Authority]] took over operations in 1962.\n\n=== Reroutes along north-south avenues ===\nWhen Broadway from [[34th Street (Manhattan)|34th Street]] to [[Columbus Circle]], Sixth Avenue from 34th Street to 59th Street, and Seventh Avenue from Times Square to 59th Street became [[one-way street]]s on March 10, 1957, the Broadway-Seventh Avenue route 6's northbound route was shifted to Sixth Avenue between 34th and 59th Streets.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1957/03/11/archives/midtown-gets-new-traffic-pattern-oneway-plan-starts-smoothlybig.html|title=Midtown Gets New Traffic Pattern; One-Way Plan Starts Smoothly - Big Test Will Come Today|last=Ingraham|first=Joseph C.|date=1957-03-11|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-02-06|url-status=live|pages=1, 22|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>  When several lower Manhattan streets were converted to one-way traffic on June 3, 1962, the 6's northbound path in the area was rearranged to travel along [[Greenwich Street (Manhattan)|Greenwich Street]], Trinity Place and [[Church Street (Manhattan)|Church Street]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1962/05/28/archives/barnes-to-speed-downtown-flow-new-oneway-designations-on-the-west.html|title=Barnes to Speed Downtown Flow; New One-Way Designations on the West Side to Go Into Effect on Sunday|last=Stengren|first=Bernard|date=1962-05-28|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-02-06|url-status=live|page=33|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>  Following the one-way conversions of Sixth Avenue below 34th Street to one-way northbound, and of Broadway between 34th and 23rd Streets and between 14th and Canal Streets to one-way southbound, on November 10, 1963, the NYCO's Sixth Avenue bus (numbered 5) was discontinued and absorbed into the 6, now designated the '''Broadway-Seventh Avenue-Avenue of the Americas Line''', and later [[Sixth Avenue Line (Manhattan surface)|M6]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1963/11/05/archives/city-to-extend-oneway-traffic-to-3-manhattan-routes-sunday-broadway.html|title=City to Extend One-Way Traffic To 3 Manhattan Routes Sunday; Broadway, Sixth Avenue and Lafayette Involved|last=|first=|date=1963-11-05|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-02-06|url-status=live|page=1|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>[[File:MTA New York City Bus DesignLine EcoSaver IV (2009).jpg|thumb|right|An M5 [[DesignLine Corporation|DesignLine EcoSaver IV]] bus in 2009 at LaGuardia Place in Greenwich Village, its terminus from 1963 to 2010; the bus has since been retired.]]Meanwhile, the [[Fifth Avenue Coach Company]] had been operating its own route 5, the '''Fifth Avenue\u2013Riverside Drive''' line, since August 5, 1900.

However, according to predictions, SL3 is not stable in other Betacoronaviruses like [[Murine coronavirus|MHV]].\n\nThe 5' UTR of [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2|SARS-CoV-2]] is predicted to consist of 4 distinct stem-loops, namely SL1, SL2, '''SL3''' and SL4. Further, there is a larger structure, '''SL5''', present, which includes the first ORFs of the [[polyprotein]]. Note, that SL3 is typically present in SARS coronaviruses, but not necessarily conserved among other Betacoronaviruses.\n\n== Gammacoronavirus 5' UTR ==\nThe 5' UTR of [[Gammacoronavirus|Gammacoronaviruses]] is similar to the 5' UTRs of Alpha- and Betacoronaviruses, as they also contain three helices denoted as SL1, SL2 and SL4. Further, in a subset of Gammacoronaviruses a third stem-loop, '''SL3''', is observed. SL1 and SL2 have major impacts of the level of viral replication, whereas SL4 is hypothesized to play a role as a \"spacer\" during the template-switch of sgRNA synthesis. \n\n== Deltacoronavirus 5' UTR ==\nThe 5'UTR of [[Deltacoronavirus|Deltacoronaviruses]] is similar to the 5'UTRs of Alpha- and Betacoronaviruses, as they also contain three helices denoted as SL1, SL2 and SL4. Predictions show a conserved fourth stem-loop ('''SL3''') between SL2 and SL4, sometimes observed in Beta- and Gammacoronaviruses as well. SL3 usually exposes the TRS-L sequence in the loop region. \n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Coronavirus 3' UTR]]\n* [[Coronavirus 3' UTR pseudoknot]]\n* [[Coronavirus 3' stem-loop II-like motif (s2m)]]\n* [[Coronavirus frameshifting stimulation element]]\n* [[Coronavirus packaging signal]]<br />\n\n{{Navbox|name=hide the gallery|title=Gallery of Coronavirus 5' UTRs|titlestyle=background:#e7dcc3|state=autocollapse|list1={{Gallery\n| lines=5\n| Image:RF03116.svg|'''aCoV-5UTR''' Secondary structure taken from the [http://rfam.org Rfam] database.

The route is operated by [[MTA Regional Bus Operations]], under the [[New York City Transit buses|New York City Bus]] and [[M15 SBS (New York City bus)|Select Bus Service]] brands.\n\nThe B82 was created in 1995 as a combination of two routes: one running from [[Bath Beach, Brooklyn|Bath Beach]] to [[Midwood, Brooklyn]], and another running from Starrett City to the [[New York City Subway]]'s [[Canarsie\u2013Rockaway Parkway (BMT Canarsie Line)|Canarsie\u2013Rockaway Parkway]] station.

Since residents on Avenue K and the local City Council member protested the move, the B50 temporarily returned to Flatbush Avenue on May 9, 1993. It was decided to maintain the routing via Flatbush Avenue due to their wishes, even though the alternate routing would have saved $30,000 annually.<ref>\n* {{Cite book|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/127872292@N06/39725498233/in/dateposted-public/|title=NYC Transit Committee Agenda June 1994|date=June 10, 1994|publisher=New York City Transit|pages=D.42}}\n* {{Cite book|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/127872292@N06/32815425228/in/dateposted-public/|title=NYC Transit Committee Agenda June 1994|date=June 10, 1994|publisher=New York City Transit|pages=D.43}}\n* {{Cite book|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/127872292@N06/45965522304/in/dateposted-public/|title=NYC Transit Committee Agenda June 1994|date=June 10, 1994|publisher=New York City Transit|pages=D.44}}\n* {{Cite book|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/127872292@N06/45965520964/in/dateposted-public/|title=NYC Transit Committee Agenda June 1994|date=June 10, 1994|publisher=New York City Transit|pages=D.45}}\n</ref>\n\nThe B5 and B50 were combined to form the B82 on September 10, 1995.<ref name=\"September 10, 1995\">''[[The New York Times]]'', [https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60614FF39540C738EDDA10894DD494D81 Coming Transit Reductions: What They Mean for You], August 20, 1995, section 13, page 10</ref><ref name=\"DailyNews-Sept10-1995\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/boroughs/at-a-glance-bus-service-article-1.709820|title=AT-A-GLANCE BUS SERVICE CHANGES|date=September 17, 1995|publisher=[[Daily News (New York)]]|accessdate=December 19, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn late April 2001, after the reopening of a ramp to the Belt Parkway that had been closed for 35 years, left turns from southbound Cropsey Avenue to eastbound Bay 52nd Street were prohibited. The [[New York City Transit Authority]], which runs the B82 route, had not been informed of the traffic pattern change. As such, southbound B82 buses were required to make a circuitous detour, turning right from Cropsey onto 26th Avenue, then left onto a service road of Shore Parkway. With the new traffic pattern, the southbound B82 was able to continue on its route, but it skipped four stops that were formerly located on Cropsey Avenue, which prompted complaints from elderly riders. Several hundred people protested the change, and on May 26, 2001, the four bus stops were restored with the installation of a left turn lane at Canal Avenue, a block south of Bay 52nd Street.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/20/nyregion/neighborhood-report-bensonhurst-traffic-collision-on-ramp-vs-bus-stops.html|title=NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: BENSONHURST; Traffic Collision: On-Ramp vs. Bus Stops|last=Bahrampour|first=Tara|date=May 20, 2001|work=The New York Times|access-date=May 14, 2017|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/03/nyregion/neighborhood-report-brooklyn-updates-stops-restored-smiles-return.html|title=NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: BROOKLYN -- UPDATES; Stops Restored, Smiles Return|last=Bahrampour|first=Tara|date=June 3, 2001|work=The New York Times|access-date=May 14, 2017|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> At the time, the B82 terminated at Canal Avenue.<ref name=MTA-B82-2003/>\n\nThe B82 was extended to Coney Island on September 7, 2003.

Limited-stop service was implemented on the B82 because ridership had increased significantly on the route since the introduction of [[MetroCard]] in the late 1990s; because of heavy traffic congestion; and because of the concentration of riders at specific stops along the route.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nTo reduce missed connections and waiting time between the {{NYC bus link|B36}}/B82 buses and the {{NYCS trains|Brighton south|type=route}} at Coney Island, New York City Transit began operating yellow holding lights to signal bus operators to wait for imminently arriving trains.

All B82 SBS service began to terminate at Cropsey Avenue and Bay 38th Street; only B82 local service would continue to Coney Island, because of low ridership between Cropsey Avenue/Bay 38th Street and Coney Island. To avoid congestion, the B82 SBS was rerouted via Avenue K instead of using Flatbush Avenue to connect Flatlands Avenue and Kings Highway. Additionally, the B82's circuitous westbound routing to the Rockaway Parkway subway station was streamlined. The B82 used to continue west on Flatlands Avenue where it made a right onto East 96th Street and then onto eastbound Glenwood Road. At East 98th Street, the B82 turned left into the Rockaway Parkway terminal, where it made an additional 180-degree turn onto southbound Rockaway Parkway. The B82 turned right at Flatlands Avenue and resumes its westbound route.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/nyct/bus/schedule/bkln/b082cur.pdf|title=B82 bus schedule|date=September 2, 2018|website=mta.info|publisher=MTA Regional Bus Operations|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180930221430/http://web.mta.info/nyct/bus/schedule/bkln/b082cur.pdf|archive-date=September 30, 2018|url-status=live|access-date=October 5, 2018}}</ref> This detour sometimes took as long as 10 minutes to get back to Flatlands Avenue.

It was decided to maintain the routing via Flatbush Avenue due to their wishes, even though the alternate routing would have saved $30,000 annually.<ref>\n* {{Cite book|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/127872292@N06/39725498233/in/dateposted-public/|title=NYC Transit Committee Agenda June 1994|date=June 10, 1994|publisher=New York City Transit|pages=D.42}}\n* {{Cite book|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/127872292@N06/32815425228/in/dateposted-public/|title=NYC Transit Committee Agenda June 1994|date=June 10, 1994|publisher=New York City Transit|pages=D.43}}\n* {{Cite book|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/127872292@N06/45965522304/in/dateposted-public/|title=NYC Transit Committee Agenda June 1994|date=June 10, 1994|publisher=New York City Transit|pages=D.44}}\n* {{Cite book|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/127872292@N06/45965520964/in/dateposted-public/|title=NYC Transit Committee Agenda June 1994|date=June 10, 1994|publisher=New York City Transit|pages=D.45}}\n</ref>\n\nThe B5 and B50 were combined to form the B82 on September 10, 1995.<ref name=\"September 10, 1995\">''[[The New York Times]]'', [https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60614FF39540C738EDDA10894DD494D81 Coming Transit Reductions: What They Mean for You], August 20, 1995, section 13, page 10</ref><ref name=\"DailyNews-Sept10-1995\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/boroughs/at-a-glance-bus-service-article-1.709820|title=AT-A-GLANCE BUS SERVICE CHANGES|date=September 17, 1995|publisher=[[Daily News (New York)]]|accessdate=December 19, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn late April 2001, after the reopening of a ramp to the Belt Parkway that had been closed for 35 years, left turns from southbound Cropsey Avenue to eastbound Bay 52nd Street were prohibited.

As such, southbound B82 buses were required to make a circuitous detour, turning right from Cropsey onto 26th Avenue, then left onto a service road of Shore Parkway. With the new traffic pattern, the southbound B82 was able to continue on its route, but it skipped four stops that were formerly located on Cropsey Avenue, which prompted complaints from elderly riders. Several hundred people protested the change, and on May 26, 2001, the four bus stops were restored with the installation of a left turn lane at Canal Avenue, a block south of Bay 52nd Street.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/20/nyregion/neighborhood-report-bensonhurst-traffic-collision-on-ramp-vs-bus-stops.html|title=NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: BENSONHURST; Traffic Collision: On-Ramp vs. Bus Stops|last=Bahrampour|first=Tara|date=May 20, 2001|work=The New York Times|access-date=May 14, 2017|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/03/nyregion/neighborhood-report-brooklyn-updates-stops-restored-smiles-return.html|title=NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: BROOKLYN -- UPDATES; Stops Restored, Smiles Return|last=Bahrampour|first=Tara|date=June 3, 2001|work=The New York Times|access-date=May 14, 2017|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> At the time, the B82 terminated at Canal Avenue.<ref name=MTA-B82-2003/>\n\nThe B82 was extended to Coney Island on September 7, 2003.

Limited-stop service was expected to cut travel times by up to ten minutes. Of the 55 bus stops along the B82 route, 18 would serve both limited-stop and local buses. Limited-stop service was implemented on the B82 because ridership had increased significantly on the route since the introduction of [[MetroCard]] in the late 1990s; because of heavy traffic congestion; and because of the concentration of riders at specific stops along the route.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nTo reduce missed connections and waiting time between the {{NYC bus link|B36}}/B82 buses and the {{NYCS trains|Brighton south|type=route}} at Coney Island, New York City Transit began operating yellow holding lights to signal bus operators to wait for imminently arriving trains.

All B82 SBS service began to terminate at Cropsey Avenue and Bay 38th Street; only B82 local service would continue to Coney Island, because of low ridership between Cropsey Avenue/Bay 38th Street and Coney Island. To avoid congestion, the B82 SBS was rerouted via Avenue K instead of using Flatbush Avenue to connect Flatlands Avenue and Kings Highway. Additionally, the B82's circuitous westbound routing to the Rockaway Parkway subway station was streamlined. The B82 used to continue west on Flatlands Avenue where it made a right onto East 96th Street and then onto eastbound Glenwood Road. At East 98th Street, the B82 turned left into the Rockaway Parkway terminal, where it made an additional 180-degree turn onto southbound Rockaway Parkway. The B82 turned right at Flatlands Avenue and resumes its westbound route.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/nyct/bus/schedule/bkln/b082cur.pdf|title=B82 bus schedule|date=September 2, 2018|website=mta.info|publisher=MTA Regional Bus Operations|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180930221430/http://web.mta.info/nyct/bus/schedule/bkln/b082cur.pdf|archive-date=September 30, 2018|url-status=live|access-date=October 5, 2018}}</ref> This detour sometimes took as long as 10 minutes to get back to Flatlands Avenue.

In between his two tenures at the SEC, Pitt was a senior corporate partner, and eventually Co-Chair of an international Wall Street law firm, where he represented numerous of the Fortune 500 corporations, most major brokerage and banking firms, and a wide array of financial services participants, including major securities exchanges. Mr. Pitt was later appointed the 26th chairman of the SEC, serving for fifteen months between 2001 and 2003 (rather than his full five-year term), before he resigned.<ref name=cfo/><ref name=autogenerated2>Jeanne Cummings, Yochi Dreazen and Michael Schroeder.

This blockbuster gained a cult status, especially for its powerful, motivational and insightful dialogs that have become street-speak for Indian audience.\n\nAnother cultish movie [[The Dirty Picture]] (2011) is loosely based on the life and times of a South Indian actor. Rajat Aroraa\u2019s script for The Dirty Picture riled up a feminist discourse and shook the conservatives of Indian society.\n\n\u201cThe naughty dialogues (Rajat Aroraa) of the film which add immense flavour to the proceedings. It\u2019s a no-holds-barred screenplay which rightly refuses to treat sex as a three letter word. [[The Dirty Picture]] is definitely not only your film for the week, but is a seminal work that will be studied in feminist discourses.\u201d<ref>{{Citation|title=The Dirty Picture Movie Review {4.5/5}: Critic Review of The Dirty Picture by Times of India|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/movie-reviews/the-dirty-picture/movie-review/10942329.cms|access-date=2020-01-10}}</ref>\n\n[[Baadshaho]] (2017), a period action-thriller was directed by Milan Luthria and starred Hindi Film superstar [[Ajay Devgn]]. The movie did well and the dialogues received audience appreciation.\n\n[[Azhar (film)|AZHAR]] (2016), a biographical sports drama based on life of the most controversial Indian Cricket Captain was produced by Sony Pictures and Balaji Telefilms.\n\nHindi dubbed version of the International blockbuster [[Captain Marvel (film)|Captain Marvel]] (2019) was scripted by Rajat Aroraa. It retained the core essence and emotions of the original and was yet relatable for Hindi speaking audience. As Aroraa said in a statement, \u201cIt is a very significant film being the first Marvel female superhero film and I am thrilled to be a part of the project!\u201d.\n\nRajat's next is [[Thalaivi]] - a trilingual biopic based on life and times of J. Jayalalithaa, late politician and film actress who served as the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, with [[Kangana Ranaut]] playing the lead.\n\nAlso in production is the Hindi remake of Telugu super hit film [[RX 100 (film)|RX 100]]  to mark the debut of Ahan Shetty, son of veteran actor [[Suniel Shetty|Suneil Shetty]].\n\n==Early life and education==\nBorn and brought up in [[New Delhi]], Rajat is an alumnus of [[Asian Academy of Film & Television]]<sup>[3]</sup> as well as a B.Com. Hon. Graduate from [[University of Delhi|Delhi University]]. A South Delhi boy who migrated to Mumbai in the late '90s, Rajat at 21 was raring to \"struggle\" and achieve his childhood dream. Luck struck when within a few months he found an opportunity to write for TV series [[CID (Indian TV series)|CID]] and [[Aahat]].\n\nRajat started as a dialogue writer but soon started contributing towards the story and screenplay for Aahat and C.I.D.\n\n==Career==\nRajat Aroraa burst into Bollywood scene as a dialogue writer for the hit movie [[Bluffmaster!|Bluffmaster]] (2005). Directed by [[Rohan Sippy]], the film was lauded for its dialogues.

The B68 is operated by the [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority|MTA]] [[New York City Transit Authority]]. Its precursor was a [[streetcar line]] that began operation in June 1862, and was known as the '''Coney Island Avenue Line'''. The route became a bus line in 1955.\n\n==Route description==\nThe B68's northern terminus is at Prospect Park Southwest and Pritchard Square near the [[15th Street\u2013Prospect Park (IND Culver Line)|15th Street\u2013Prospect Park station]] in Park Slope. Service heads south via Prospect Park Southwest and Coney Island Avenue until Brighton Beach Avenue. Service then heads west via that street until West Brighton Avenue, before turning right onto West 5th Street. Buses then make lefts at Neptune Avenue and Stilwell Avenue before terminating at the Mermaid Bus Loop at [[Coney Island\u2013Stillwell Avenue station]].<ref name=\"B68\"/>\n\n==History==\n===As a horsecar line===\nThe original line ran from the Boulevard entrance of [[Prospect Park (Brooklyn)|Prospect Park]] (Park Circle) to [[Coney Island]] and was operated by the '''Coney Island and Brooklyn Railroad (CI&B)'''. It was the first [[railroad]] of any kind to reach Coney Island. The CI&B connected to other lines to bring people from Brooklyn (then a city) and from New York City (then meaning [[Manhattan]]) to its service to Coney Island. It began operating service along the [[Smith Street Line (surface)|Smith Street Line]] to [[Fulton Ferry, Brooklyn|Fulton Ferry]] in June 1862,<ref>{{cite news |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0F17FC345B1B7493C1AB178DD85F468684F9 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120717193145/http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0F17FC345B1B7493C1AB178DD85F468684F9 |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 17, 2012 |title=Brooklyn News |date=June 23, 1862 }}</ref> so that the line was commonly called the \"Smith Street Line\". It was also known as the \"Slocum Road\" after its president, [[Henry Warner Slocum]], a [[United States Civil War|Civil War]] general and New York congressman. Slocum's name is also associated with the [[steamboat]] ''[[General Slocum]]'', involved in a disastrous fire on the [[East River]].

The B68 is operated by the [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority|MTA]] [[New York City Transit Authority]]. Its precursor was a [[streetcar line]] that began operation in June 1862, and was known as the '''Coney Island Avenue Line'''. The route became a bus line in 1955.\n\n==Route description==\nThe B68's northern terminus is at Prospect Park Southwest and Pritchard Square near the [[15th Street\u2013Prospect Park (IND Culver Line)|15th Street\u2013Prospect Park station]] in Park Slope. Service heads south via Prospect Park Southwest and Coney Island Avenue until Brighton Beach Avenue. Service then heads west via that street until West Brighton Avenue, before turning right onto West 5th Street. Buses then make lefts at Neptune Avenue and Stilwell Avenue before terminating at the Mermaid Bus Loop at [[Coney Island\u2013Stillwell Avenue station]].<ref name=\"B68\"/>\n\n==History==\n===As a horsecar line===\nThe original line ran from the Boulevard entrance of [[Prospect Park (Brooklyn)|Prospect Park]] (Park Circle) to [[Coney Island]] and was operated by the '''Coney Island and Brooklyn Railroad (CI&B)'''. It was the first [[railroad]] of any kind to reach Coney Island. The CI&B connected to other lines to bring people from Brooklyn (then a city) and from New York City (then meaning [[Manhattan]]) to its service to Coney Island. It began operating service along the [[Smith Street Line (surface)|Smith Street Line]] to [[Fulton Ferry, Brooklyn|Fulton Ferry]] in June 1862,<ref>{{cite news |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0F17FC345B1B7493C1AB178DD85F468684F9 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120717193145/http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0F17FC345B1B7493C1AB178DD85F468684F9 |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 17, 2012 |title=Brooklyn News |date=June 23, 1862 }}</ref> so that the line was commonly called the \"Smith Street Line\". It was also known as the \"Slocum Road\" after its president, [[Henry Warner Slocum]], a [[United States Civil War|Civil War]] general and New York congressman. Slocum's name is also associated with the [[steamboat]] ''[[General Slocum]]'', involved in a disastrous fire on the [[East River]].
