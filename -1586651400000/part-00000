The airport is located {{convert|6|NM|abbr=on|lk=in}} southwest of Stavanger, in the municipality of [[Sola]].<ref name=\"aip_enzv\"/> It is Norway's [[list of the largest airports in the Nordic countries|third-busiest airport]], with both [[fixed-wing aircraft]] and [[helicopter]] traffic for the offshore [[North Sea oil]] installations. In addition, the [[Royal Norwegian Air Force]] operates [[Westland Sea King]] [[search and rescue]] helicopters from [[Sola Air Station]].\n\nThe airport had 85 306 air movements and 4,501,368 passengers in 2015. {{Cn|date=March 2020}} Five airlines offered domestic flights to nine destinations while ten airlines offered international flights to 37 destinations. Two helicopter companies operate out of Sola. The busiest route is Sola\u2013Oslo Gardermoen, which has about 28 daily flights. In the vicinity of the airport there is an aeronautical museum, [[Flyhistorisk Museum, Sola]].\n\n== History ==\n\n===The facilities===\nStavanger Airport, Sola is Norway's second oldest airport, opened by [[King Haakon VII]] 29 May 1937. The airport was the second to have a [[concrete]] [[runway]] in [[Europe]]. The airport was attacked and captured by [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (Nazi Germany)|fallschirmj\u00e4gers]] from 1st battalion of the 1st Regiment, [[1st Parachute Division (Germany)|7th Flieger Division]] supported by [[Luftwaffe]] aircraft on 9 April 1940. {{citation needed|date=August 2017}} The attack was over in an hour, and the airport remained in German hands for the duration of [[World War II]]. During the war, the German occupation forces and Luftwaffe expanded the airport considerably, as it was a vital strategic asset for the Germans. {{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Former anti-aircraft positions are also still visible along the neighboring beach [[Solastranda]].\n\nOriginally, the idea was to locate the Stavanger airport at [[Stavanger Airport, Forus|Forus]], but after the war the [[Royal Norwegian Air Force]] decided to use Sola temporarily until the new airport was built, and nothing ever became of Forus. [[Sola Air Station]] has since been of vital importance for the Norwegian armed forces, but gradually lost assignments, and in 1982 the last fighter squadron left the airport.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nStavanger Airport has two passenger terminals, one for [[airplanes]] and one for [[helicopters]]. When the present terminal was put into use 28 January 1987, it was the first airport in Norway to have [[jet bridge]]s, nine in total. {{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} The old terminal was demolished and made way for taxiway H The airport has two crossing runways: the main runway, north/south (18/36) and the main runway for helicopters, which is oriented northwest\u2013southeast (11/29).\n\nExpansion of the airplane terminal took place in 2009. The new gates were built without jetbridges. The airport's two largest airlines, SAS and Norwegian, showed little interest in such amenity and desired quicker turnaround times.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.aftenbladet.no/bildegallerier/article963503.ece|title=Ingen gangbruer til flyene|last=Helgesen|first=Jan Petter|date=December 19, 2008|publisher=Aftenbladet|language=Norwegian|access-date=2009-09-20|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001060119/http://www.aftenbladet.no/bildegallerier/article963503.ece|archive-date=October 1, 2009|df=}}</ref> SAS though later said that they did want jetbridges for their larger jet aircraft, and only wanted gates without jetbridges for their smaller turboprop aircraft.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.aftenbladet.no/lokalt/solarandaberg/977597/Uakseptabelt_for_SAS.html|title=Uakseptabelt for SAS|last=Helgesen|first=Jan Petter|date=January 24, 2009|publisher=Aftenbladet|language=Norwegian|access-date=2009-09-20|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205233026/http://www.aftenbladet.no/lokalt/solarandaberg/977597/Uakseptabelt_for_SAS.html|archive-date=February 5, 2009|df=}}</ref> The lack of jetbridges angered the societies representing the disabled and multiple sclerosis afflicted, and prompting several Rogaland politicians to put pressure on Avinor to reconsider the building.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.aftenbladet.no/lokalt/solarandaberg/980883/Fylket_ber_Navarsete_legge_press_paa_Avinor.html|title=Fylket ber Navarsete legge press p\u00e5 Avinor|last=Tollaksen|first=Tor Gunnar|date=February 1, 2009|publisher=Aftenbladet|language=Norwegian|access-date=2009-09-20|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090916214648/http://aftenbladet.no/lokalt/solarandaberg/980883/Fylket_ber_Navarsete_legge_press_paa_Avinor.html|archive-date=September 16, 2009|df=}}</ref> In April 2009, Avinor decided not to build jetbridges.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://aftenbladet.no/lokalt/1011198/Rasende__paa_Avinor.html|title=Rasende p\u00e5 Avinor|last=Helgesen|first=Jan Petter|date=April 6, 2009|publisher=Aftenbladet|language=Norwegian|access-date=2009-09-20|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090407075421/http://www.aftenbladet.no/lokalt/1011198/Rasende__paa_Avinor.html|archive-date=April 7, 2009|df=}}</ref>\n\nOffshore helicopter flights out of Stavanger commenced in 1966. Instead of operating out of Sola, the operator [[Helikopter Service]] decided to operate their services out of [[Stavanger Airport, Forus]], a closed-down airport built during the [[Second World War]].<ref>Olsen-Hagen: 35</ref> Throughout the 1970s and 1980s this became an increasingly problematic solution, not least due to increased development of the area. It eventually became inevitable to relocate the base to Sola.<ref>Olsen-Hagen: 37</ref> To allow for the transfer, the airport authority built a new, separate helicopter terminal at Sola, costing 56 million [[Norwegian krone]]r. It opened on 7 March 1989, at the same time as operations ceased out of Forus. At the same time Helikopter Service built an operations center at the airport, including a hangar and maintenance center. In total the relocation from Forus cost about 120 million kroner.\n<ref>Olsen-Hagen: 39</ref>\n\n===Civilian airlines===\n[[File:Opening of Sola Airport.jpg|thumb|Sola Airport being opened, to the right a [[Deutsche Luft Hansa]] [[Junkers G.38]]]]\n\n[[Det Norske Luftfartsselskap]] (DNL, later [[Scandinavian Airlines|Scandinavian Airlines System]] or SAS) started flying to Sola after the war, as did [[Braathens SAFE]] in 1946 on its routes to Europe and the Far East with the [[Douglas DC-3]] aircraft. In 1952, Braathens SAFE received [[concession (contract)|concession]] to fly the routes [[Oslo]]\u2013Stavanger, Oslo\u2013[[Kristiansand]]\u2013Stavanger and the coastal route Stavanger\u2013[[Bergen]]\u2013[[\u00c5lesund]]\u2013[[Trondheim]]\u2013[[Bod\u00f8]]\u2013[[Troms\u00f8]]. [[Wider\u00f8e]] established itself at Sola in the late 1980s after they bought [[Sandefjord Airport, Torp]]-based [[Norsk Air]].  For a time, [[Scandinavian Airlines|SAS]] operated intercontinental nonstop flights between Stavanger and [[Houston George Bush Intercontinental Airport]] (IAH) located in Texas in the U.S., with this service being operated by [[PrivatAir]] with [[Boeing 737-700]] jetliners configured with 44 business class seats.<ref>[http://airlineroute.net/2015/09/15/sk-iahewr-w15/ airlineroute.net - SAS Cancels Stavanger \u2013 Houston Route] 15 September 2015</ref>\n\nWhen the oil exploration in the Norwegian part of the [[North Sea]] started in 1967, there was a sudden need for helicopter transport out to the [[oil platforms]]. The first helicopter service was [[Helikopter Service]], later renamed CHC Helikopter Service, who started operations with 2 [[Sikorsky S-61]]Ns initially from a makeshift heliport at [[Stavanger Airport, Forus]]. {{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} The offshore helicopter operations were moved to the Sola in 1989. [[Braathens Helikopter]], a sister company of Braathens SAFE, also operated helicopters from Sola in the period 1989\u20131994, but was then sold to Helikopter Service. [[Norsk Helikopter]], later renamed [[Bristow Norway]], started their offshore flying at Sola in 1993. {{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} Bristow Norway is now the biggest helicopter company in Sola, with the average of 28 departures each day Monday\u2013Friday. {{Cn|date=March 2020}} CHC Helicopter Service has the average of 8 departures each day Monday\u2013Friday. {{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n===Foreign airlines===\n[[British Airways]] predecessors had started operating at Sola after [[World War II]], in 1980 they started regular flights with [[British Aircraft Corporation]][[BAC One-Eleven]] jet aircraft to [[London Heathrow Airport]]. Later, the route was operated with [[Boeing 737]]-200/-300/-400s. For a period the [[Boeing 737-400]] morning flight continued to [[Charles de Gaulle Airport|Paris\u2013Charles de Gaulle]] after [[London Heathrow Airport|London Heathrow]] as an extension of the flight. British Airways later started operating [[Boeing 757-200]]s with [[Boeing 737-200]]s flying new services twice daily to [[London Gatwick Airport|London\u2013Gatwick]]. In 1994, British Airways employees at Sola were transferred to Braathens SAFE as part of new cooperation between the two airlines. {{citation needed|date=August 2017}} However, in 1997, [[KLM]] bought 30% of Braathens (as the airline was renamed) and British Airways closed its Stavanger routes, because it lacked its own staff. {{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} Today British Airways operates 2 daily rotations\nutilising [[Airbus A319]] jet aircraft from [[London Heathrow Airport]] in competition with SAS Scandinavian Airlines (Also 2 rotations) to [[London Heathrow Airport]], Norwegian operates a daily rotation to London, Gatwick. [[Dan-Air]] flew the route London\u2013Gatwick \u2013 [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] \u2013 Stavanger, until they were taken over by British Airways in 1992. [[Norwegian Air Shuttle]] has flown to Newcastle as well. [[Eastern Airways]] operating [[Embraer ERJ-145]] and [[ERJ-135]] regional jets and [[Wider\u00f8e]] using [[Bombardier Aerospace|Bombardier]] Dash-8-402Q ([[Q400]]) propjets both fly to Newcastle, U.K.\n\nThe oil industry has also required scheduled routes between Stavanger and [[Scotland]], primarily to British oil center in [[Aberdeen]]. In addition to SAS, [[Air Anglia]] (later [[AirUK]], [[KLMuk]]) flew the route. Today, this route is flown by [[Scandinavian Airlines]], [[Wider\u00f8e]] and [[Eastern Airways]]. In the 1970s, [[KLM Royal Dutch Airlines]] started flights to Stavanger from [[Amsterdam]]. They have used the [[Douglas DC-9-10]], [[Boeing 737]], [[Fokker 100]], [[Fokker F27]] and [[Fokker 50]] aircraft, and this route was the first operated by KLM with [[Fokker 70]]s (their first Fokker 70 is named \"City of Stavanger\"). The route was operated by Braathens between 1997 and 2002. Today, this route is flown by the KLM five times daily by [[Boeing 737]], [[Fokker 70]] and [[Embraer ERJ-190]] aircraft, the latter two aircraft operated by [[KLM Cityhopper]]. {{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n[[Air France]] also operated to Stavanger, initially routing [[Charles de Gaulle Airport|Paris\u2013Charles de Gaulle]] - Stavanger - Gothenburg using [[Boeing 737]]s. The route later became a twice-daily direct Paris - Stavanger connection using [[Embraer ERJ-170]] jet aircraft, until it was discontinued in October 2015.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://airlineroute.net/2015/05/21/af-europe-w15/ |title=AIRFRANCE Ends 3 European Routes in W15 |publisher=Airline Route |accessdate=21 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Norwegian authorities have denied, among others, [[Northwest Airlines]] (since merged into [[Delta Air Lines]]) the right to start flying intercontinental flights from the [[United States]]. [[Lufthansa]] started in 2003 to fly twice daily to its [[airline hub|hub]] in [[Frankfurt]] in [[Germany]] with the [[Canadair Regional Jet|Canadair RJ-700]] aircraft, but ceased flying the route in October 2015.\n\nIn 2005, work to upgrade the terminal building started. A new domestic arrival hall was opened in the summer of 2005, followed by the refurbishing of the international arrival hall. A new international lounge finished in 2006 and a new baggage sorting system, and an extension of the check-in areas was completed in 2007. Avinor is working on the [[instrument landing system]] category II/LVTO approach system at the airport. This will allow planes to land with as little as 300 meters of horizontal visibility. {{Cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nOn 15 February 2010, Scandinavian Airlines announced that Wider\u00f8e would take over their regional routes connecting airports in Western Norway, including the route from Stavanger to Kristiansand. SAS will retire their five Fokker 50 aircraft by November 2010, and Wider\u00f8e will take over the operations and 75 employees, and serve the routes using Q300 and Q400 aircraft.<ref>{{cite news

The [[330 Squadron]] operated [[Westland Sea King|Sea King]] [[search and rescue]] helicopters are the only squadron left at the airport, but still a number of military aircraft can be seen at the airport. [[NATO]]'s [[E-3 Sentry|AWACS]] aircraft, VIP transports, airlift command and fighter and attack aircraft are regular visitors. Technicians and equipment at the Sola AFB facilitate turnover and housing of fighters, predominately the RNoAF F-16A Fighting Falcons, as well as F-16s and other aircraft from NATO allies. Facilitating the Marines and Airforces training base, NATO FORSACS and NATO Joint Warfare Centre amongst others.\n\nThe Sola AFB is a NATO 24-hour readiness base for deployment of aircraft and military personnel in the event of a military escalated tension or conflict.\n\n==Technical facilities==\nSola has quite a number of technical facilities, and has the largest aviation technical environment in Norway, including the largest helicopter maintenance facilities in Northern Europe, Braathens had its technical main base at Sola, as does Norwegian Air Shuttle, CHC Helikopter Service, Heli-One Norway, Bristow Norway, Norsk Helikopterservice, [[Norcopter]], [[Pratt & Whitney]] Norway Engine Centre and the air force's helicopter main technical base. The former Braathens hangars now house SAS Technical Services, Norwegian Technical Services (which has their technical main base for their Boeing 737 fleet here) and Norsk Helikopterservice is to move into the former Braathens paint-hangar. {{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} Heli-One (when part of Helikopter Service) had final assembly of most of the Bell 412 helicopters when introduced to the RNoAF. Both Bristow and Heli-One have their heavy duty maintenance facilities for their Sikorsky S-92A at the airport. Heli-One also specialises in the maintenance of the Turbomecca engines and the gearbox of the Super Puma. The airport also has the only Norwegian education school for aircraft mechanics, they are certified by Eurocopter qualifying them to make conversions of Eurocopter helicopters, they perform heavy duty maintenance tasks for many operators and air forces of foreign nations.\n\nOn 16 June 2006 the board of SAS decided to close the SAS owned Braathens Technical Services at Sola, which resulted in over 300 job losses. This was despite Beaathens Technical Services being the only profit making heavy maintenance center in the SAS Group and award winner in achievements, the SAS unions having the upper hand since SAS acquired Braathens. Braathens Technical Services undertook services for many customers including Boeing. {{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nOn 31 March 2012 the board of Pratt & Whitney also decided to close the Pratt & Whitney Norway Engine Center.<ref>http://www.aftenbladet.no/okonomi/195-ansatte-mister-jobben-450960b.html</ref> The last engine left the shop on 20 June 2012.

Although the orientation isn` t ideal for operating planes from both runways, they are both most commonly active at the same time, 18/36 for planes and 11/29 for helicopters operating from it, having to keep well within the bounds of their intersection allowing for helicopters to operate from 29 to taxiway H, and departure from 11 from taxiway H, utilising both directions for helicopters, hotel and to the outer edge. Runway 18\u201336 has a CAT II landing system, enabling landing in very poor visibility. 11/29 only has ILS from one direction, 29, 11 is less frequently used, among other considerations to reduce noise emissions and flying over built areas, catering for population living in central parts of Sola municipality.\n\n==Accidents==\n''See [[1961 Holtaheia Vickers Viking crash]].''\n\nOn 9 August 1961 [[Vickers VC.1 Viking]] 3B (registration: G-AHPM), operated by Cunard Eagle Airways (later [[British Eagle]]) crashed on into a mountain near [[Holta]] on approach to Stavanger Airport, Sola from [[London Heathrow]] airport with the deaths of all 39 on board: 3 crew, 34 schoolboys from [[The Archbishop Lanfranc School]] in [[Thornton Heath]], London, plus two members of staff from the school.

The airport is located {{convert|6|NM|abbr=on|lk=in}} southwest of Stavanger, in the municipality of [[Sola]].<ref name=\"aip_enzv\"/> It is Norway's [[list of the largest airports in the Nordic countries|third-busiest airport]], with both [[fixed-wing aircraft]] and [[helicopter]] traffic for the offshore [[North Sea oil]] installations. In addition, the [[Royal Norwegian Air Force]] operates [[Westland Sea King]] [[search and rescue]] helicopters from [[Sola Air Station]].\n\nThe airport had 85 306 air movements and 4,501,368 passengers in 2015. {{Cn|date=March 2020}} Five airlines offered domestic flights to nine destinations while ten airlines offered international flights to 37 destinations. Two helicopter companies operate out of Sola. The busiest route is Sola\u2013Oslo Gardermoen, which has about 28 daily flights. In the vicinity of the airport there is an aeronautical museum, [[Flyhistorisk Museum, Sola]].\n\n== History ==\n\n===The facilities===\nStavanger Airport, Sola is Norway's second oldest airport, opened by [[King Haakon VII]] 29 May 1937. The airport was the second to have a [[concrete]] [[runway]] in [[Europe]]. The airport was attacked and captured by [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (Nazi Germany)|fallschirmj\u00e4gers]] from 1st battalion of the 1st Regiment, [[1st Parachute Division (Germany)|7th Flieger Division]] supported by [[Luftwaffe]] aircraft on 9 April 1940. {{citation needed|date=August 2017}} The attack was over in an hour, and the airport remained in German hands for the duration of [[World War II]]. During the war, the German occupation forces and Luftwaffe expanded the airport considerably, as it was a vital strategic asset for the Germans. {{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Former anti-aircraft positions are also still visible along the neighboring beach [[Solastranda]].\n\nOriginally, the idea was to locate the Stavanger airport at [[Stavanger Airport, Forus|Forus]], but after the war the [[Royal Norwegian Air Force]] decided to use Sola temporarily until the new airport was built, and nothing ever became of Forus. [[Sola Air Station]] has since been of vital importance for the Norwegian armed forces, but gradually lost assignments, and in 1982 the last fighter squadron left the airport.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nStavanger Airport has two passenger terminals, one for [[airplanes]] and one for [[helicopters]]. When the present terminal was put into use 28 January 1987, it was the first airport in Norway to have [[jet bridge]]s, nine in total. {{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} The old terminal was demolished and made way for taxiway H The airport has two crossing runways: the main runway, north/south (18/36) and the main runway for helicopters, which is oriented northwest\u2013southeast (11/29).\n\nExpansion of the airplane terminal took place in 2009. The new gates were built without jetbridges. The airport's two largest airlines, SAS and Norwegian, showed little interest in such amenity and desired quicker turnaround times.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.aftenbladet.no/bildegallerier/article963503.ece|title=Ingen gangbruer til flyene|last=Helgesen|first=Jan Petter|date=December 19, 2008|publisher=Aftenbladet|language=Norwegian|access-date=2009-09-20|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001060119/http://www.aftenbladet.no/bildegallerier/article963503.ece|archive-date=October 1, 2009|df=}}</ref> SAS though later said that they did want jetbridges for their larger jet aircraft, and only wanted gates without jetbridges for their smaller turboprop aircraft.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.aftenbladet.no/lokalt/solarandaberg/977597/Uakseptabelt_for_SAS.html|title=Uakseptabelt for SAS|last=Helgesen|first=Jan Petter|date=January 24, 2009|publisher=Aftenbladet|language=Norwegian|access-date=2009-09-20|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205233026/http://www.aftenbladet.no/lokalt/solarandaberg/977597/Uakseptabelt_for_SAS.html|archive-date=February 5, 2009|df=}}</ref> The lack of jetbridges angered the societies representing the disabled and multiple sclerosis afflicted, and prompting several Rogaland politicians to put pressure on Avinor to reconsider the building.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.aftenbladet.no/lokalt/solarandaberg/980883/Fylket_ber_Navarsete_legge_press_paa_Avinor.html|title=Fylket ber Navarsete legge press p\u00e5 Avinor|last=Tollaksen|first=Tor Gunnar|date=February 1, 2009|publisher=Aftenbladet|language=Norwegian|access-date=2009-09-20|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090916214648/http://aftenbladet.no/lokalt/solarandaberg/980883/Fylket_ber_Navarsete_legge_press_paa_Avinor.html|archive-date=September 16, 2009|df=}}</ref> In April 2009, Avinor decided not to build jetbridges.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://aftenbladet.no/lokalt/1011198/Rasende__paa_Avinor.html|title=Rasende p\u00e5 Avinor|last=Helgesen|first=Jan Petter|date=April 6, 2009|publisher=Aftenbladet|language=Norwegian|access-date=2009-09-20|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090407075421/http://www.aftenbladet.no/lokalt/1011198/Rasende__paa_Avinor.html|archive-date=April 7, 2009|df=}}</ref>\n\nOffshore helicopter flights out of Stavanger commenced in 1966.

In 1994, British Airways employees at Sola were transferred to Braathens SAFE as part of new cooperation between the two airlines. {{citation needed|date=August 2017}} However, in 1997, [[KLM]] bought 30% of Braathens (as the airline was renamed) and British Airways closed its Stavanger routes, because it lacked its own staff. {{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} Today British Airways operates 2 daily rotations\nutilising [[Airbus A319]] jet aircraft from [[London Heathrow Airport]] in competition with SAS Scandinavian Airlines (Also 2 rotations) to [[London Heathrow Airport]], Norwegian operates a daily rotation to London, Gatwick. [[Dan-Air]] flew the route London\u2013Gatwick \u2013 [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] \u2013 Stavanger, until they were taken over by British Airways in 1992. [[Norwegian Air Shuttle]] has flown to Newcastle as well. [[Eastern Airways]] operating [[Embraer ERJ-145]] and [[ERJ-135]] regional jets and [[Wider\u00f8e]] using [[Bombardier Aerospace|Bombardier]] Dash-8-402Q ([[Q400]]) propjets both fly to Newcastle, U.K.\n\nThe oil industry has also required scheduled routes between Stavanger and [[Scotland]], primarily to British oil center in [[Aberdeen]]. In addition to SAS, [[Air Anglia]] (later [[AirUK]], [[KLMuk]]) flew the route. Today, this route is flown by [[Scandinavian Airlines]], [[Wider\u00f8e]] and [[Eastern Airways]]. In the 1970s, [[KLM Royal Dutch Airlines]] started flights to Stavanger from [[Amsterdam]]. They have used the [[Douglas DC-9-10]], [[Boeing 737]], [[Fokker 100]], [[Fokker F27]] and [[Fokker 50]] aircraft, and this route was the first operated by KLM with [[Fokker 70]]s (their first Fokker 70 is named \"City of Stavanger\"). The route was operated by Braathens between 1997 and 2002. Today, this route is flown by the KLM five times daily by [[Boeing 737]], [[Fokker 70]] and [[Embraer ERJ-190]] aircraft, the latter two aircraft operated by [[KLM Cityhopper]]. {{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n[[Air France]] also operated to Stavanger, initially routing [[Charles de Gaulle Airport|Paris\u2013Charles de Gaulle]] - Stavanger - Gothenburg using [[Boeing 737]]s. The route later became a twice-daily direct Paris - Stavanger connection using [[Embraer ERJ-170]] jet aircraft, until it was discontinued in October 2015.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://airlineroute.net/2015/05/21/af-europe-w15/ |title=AIRFRANCE Ends 3 European Routes in W15 |publisher=Airline Route |accessdate=21 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Norwegian authorities have denied, among others, [[Northwest Airlines]] (since merged into [[Delta Air Lines]]) the right to start flying intercontinental flights from the [[United States]]. [[Lufthansa]] started in 2003 to fly twice daily to its [[airline hub|hub]] in [[Frankfurt]] in [[Germany]] with the [[Canadair Regional Jet|Canadair RJ-700]] aircraft, but ceased flying the route in October 2015.\n\nIn 2005, work to upgrade the terminal building started. A new domestic arrival hall was opened in the summer of 2005, followed by the refurbishing of the international arrival hall. A new international lounge finished in 2006 and a new baggage sorting system, and an extension of the check-in areas was completed in 2007. Avinor is working on the [[instrument landing system]] category II/LVTO approach system at the airport. This will allow planes to land with as little as 300 meters of horizontal visibility. {{Cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nOn 15 February 2010, Scandinavian Airlines announced that Wider\u00f8e would take over their regional routes connecting airports in Western Norway, including the route from Stavanger to Kristiansand. SAS will retire their five Fokker 50 aircraft by November 2010, and Wider\u00f8e will take over the operations and 75 employees, and serve the routes using Q300 and Q400 aircraft.<ref>{{cite news

The [[330 Squadron]] operated [[Westland Sea King|Sea King]] [[search and rescue]] helicopters are the only squadron left at the airport, but still a number of military aircraft can be seen at the airport. [[NATO]]'s [[E-3 Sentry|AWACS]] aircraft, VIP transports, airlift command and fighter and attack aircraft are regular visitors. Technicians and equipment at the Sola AFB facilitate turnover and housing of fighters, predominately the RNoAF F-16A Fighting Falcons, as well as F-16s and other aircraft from NATO allies. Facilitating the Marines and Airforces training base, NATO FORSACS and NATO Joint Warfare Centre amongst others.\n\nThe Sola AFB is a NATO 24-hour readiness base for deployment of aircraft and military personnel in the event of a military escalated tension or conflict.\n\n==Technical facilities==\nSola has quite a number of technical facilities, and has the largest aviation technical environment in Norway, including the largest helicopter maintenance facilities in Northern Europe, Braathens had its technical main base at Sola, as does Norwegian Air Shuttle, CHC Helikopter Service, Heli-One Norway, Bristow Norway, Norsk Helikopterservice, [[Norcopter]], [[Pratt & Whitney]] Norway Engine Centre and the air force's helicopter main technical base. The former Braathens hangars now house SAS Technical Services, Norwegian Technical Services (which has their technical main base for their Boeing 737 fleet here) and Norsk Helikopterservice is to move into the former Braathens paint-hangar. {{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} Heli-One (when part of Helikopter Service) had final assembly of most of the Bell 412 helicopters when introduced to the RNoAF. Both Bristow and Heli-One have their heavy duty maintenance facilities for their Sikorsky S-92A at the airport. Heli-One also specialises in the maintenance of the Turbomecca engines and the gearbox of the Super Puma. The airport also has the only Norwegian education school for aircraft mechanics, they are certified by Eurocopter qualifying them to make conversions of Eurocopter helicopters, they perform heavy duty maintenance tasks for many operators and air forces of foreign nations.\n\nOn 16 June 2006 the board of SAS decided to close the SAS owned Braathens Technical Services at Sola, which resulted in over 300 job losses. This was despite Beaathens Technical Services being the only profit making heavy maintenance center in the SAS Group and award winner in achievements, the SAS unions having the upper hand since SAS acquired Braathens. Braathens Technical Services undertook services for many customers including Boeing. {{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nOn 31 March 2012 the board of Pratt & Whitney also decided to close the Pratt & Whitney Norway Engine Center.<ref>http://www.aftenbladet.no/okonomi/195-ansatte-mister-jobben-450960b.html</ref> The last engine left the shop on 20 June 2012.

Although the orientation isn` t ideal for operating planes from both runways, they are both most commonly active at the same time, 18/36 for planes and 11/29 for helicopters operating from it, having to keep well within the bounds of their intersection allowing for helicopters to operate from 29 to taxiway H, and departure from 11 from taxiway H, utilising both directions for helicopters, hotel and to the outer edge. Runway 18\u201336 has a CAT II landing system, enabling landing in very poor visibility. 11/29 only has ILS from one direction, 29, 11 is less frequently used, among other considerations to reduce noise emissions and flying over built areas, catering for population living in central parts of Sola municipality.\n\n==Accidents==\n''See [[1961 Holtaheia Vickers Viking crash]].''\n\nOn 9 August 1961 [[Vickers VC.1 Viking]] 3B (registration: G-AHPM), operated by Cunard Eagle Airways (later [[British Eagle]]) crashed on into a mountain near [[Holta]] on approach to Stavanger Airport, Sola from [[London Heathrow]] airport with the deaths of all 39 on board: 3 crew, 34 schoolboys from [[The Archbishop Lanfranc School]] in [[Thornton Heath]], London, plus two members of staff from the school.

The previous member, former [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] [[Deputy Prime Minister of Australia|Deputy Prime Minister]] [[Lance Barnard]], had held it for 21 years, though he had been gradually losing support in recent years. Newman had already been preselected for the next election, and had been nursing the seat for some time.\n\nNonetheless, it came as a surprise when Newman took the seat off Labor with a massive 14-point swing, turning Bass into a safe Liberal seat at one stroke.  His primary vote margin was actually large enough to win without the need for preferences. This shock result is reckoned as the beginning of the end for [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[Gough Whitlam]], as Newman's victory emboldened the Coalition to push for new elections for a House of Representatives barely a year old\u2014even to the point of blocking supply. The Whitlam government was dismissed [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis|six months later]].\n\nNewman easily retained his seat at [[1975 Australian federal election|the December 1975 general election]].  With the election of the [[Malcolm Fraser|Fraser]] government, he was appointed [[Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Australia)|Minister for Repatriation]] in the [[second Fraser Ministry]].  In July 1976, he became [[Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts (Australia)|Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development]] when [[Ivor Greenwood]] became ill. He was responsible for environment issues when the decision was taken to cease sand mining on world heritage listed [[Fraser Island]].\n\nIn December 1978, Newman was appointed [[Minister for Resources and Energy (Australia)|Minister for National Development]] in the [[third Fraser Ministry]].  In December 1979 he was appointed [[Minister for Productivity]] and in November 1980 he was appointed [[Minister for Finance and Deregulation (Australia)|Minister for Administrative Services]] in the [[fourth Fraser Ministry]], a position he retained until the defeat of the government in the [[1983 Australian federal election|1983 election]].

The previous member, former [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] [[Deputy Prime Minister of Australia|Deputy Prime Minister]] [[Lance Barnard]], had held it for 21 years, though he had been gradually losing support in recent years. Newman had already been preselected for the next election, and had been nursing the seat for some time.\n\nNonetheless, it came as a surprise when Newman took the seat off Labor with a massive 14-point swing, turning Bass into a safe Liberal seat at one stroke.  His primary vote margin was actually large enough to win without the need for preferences. This shock result is reckoned as the beginning of the end for [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[Gough Whitlam]], as Newman's victory emboldened the Coalition to push for new elections for a House of Representatives barely a year old\u2014even to the point of blocking supply. The Whitlam government was dismissed [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis|six months later]].\n\nNewman easily retained his seat at [[1975 Australian federal election|the December 1975 general election]].  With the election of the [[Malcolm Fraser|Fraser]] government, he was appointed [[Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Australia)|Minister for Repatriation]] in the [[second Fraser Ministry]].  In July 1976, he became [[Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts (Australia)|Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development]] when [[Ivor Greenwood]] became ill. He was responsible for environment issues when the decision was taken to cease sand mining on world heritage listed [[Fraser Island]].\n\nIn December 1978, Newman was appointed [[Minister for Resources and Energy (Australia)|Minister for National Development]] in the [[third Fraser Ministry]].  In December 1979 he was appointed [[Minister for Productivity]] and in November 1980 he was appointed [[Minister for Finance and Deregulation (Australia)|Minister for Administrative Services]] in the [[fourth Fraser Ministry]], a position he retained until the defeat of the government in the [[1983 Australian federal election|1983 election]].  He retired from the parliament prior to the [[1984 Australian federal election|1984 election]].\n\n==Post-political activities==\nIn retirement, Newman was appointed President of the [[National Trust of Australia|National Trust]] [[Tasmania]], a member of the board of the [[Menzies Foundation]] and a director of the [[Australian Stockman's Hall of Fame]] in [[Longreach, Queensland|Longreach]], Queensland.\n\nNewman was the Chairman of the [[Old Parliament House, Canberra|Old Parliament House]] Governing Council from 1997 to 1999.\n\nHe was appointed an [[Officer of the Order of Australia]] in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours]] of 1994.<ref>[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=872480&search_type=quick&showInd=true It's an Honour] \u2013 Officer of the Order of Australia</ref>\n\n==Family==\nNewman was married to [[Jocelyn Newman]], a Senator for Tasmania, and Minister for Family and Community Services and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women in the [[John Howard|Howard government]].

It interested us because the fragility of democracy has been put to the test quite profoundly in recent years... By 1929, new opportunities were arising.

The engine driver and a train worker are ambushed by several armed, [[Russian language|Russian]]-speaking men. The men couple an additional car to the train, and two Russian men replace the Germans who are killed by shots to the head. Meanwhile, Gereon Rath, a [[morphine]] addict and [[World War I]] veteran who worked as a police inspector in [[Cologne]] is transferred to Berlin. He and his new partner, Bruno Wolter, visit a photographic studio which is actually a pornographic film set and production studio. As they arrest Johann K\u00f6nig, the owner, another man flees, and shoots at Gereon, but is subdued by Bruno. Bruno lets him go since the man is Franz Krajewski, one of his informants. He fought in World War I and was fired from his job as a policeman because he overreacted in a shoot-out, due to his [[PTSD]]. Franz goes to a therapist (Dr Schmidt), revealing that the police arrested K\u00f6nig and are looking for \"the film\". The therapist later meets with a mysterious man, referred to only as \"The Armenian\". The Armenian says he will take care of the film. At the police station, Gereon bumps into Charlotte Ritter after stepping out of a [[paternoster lift]]. She works as an archivist at the homicide division in order to provide for her family who live under pitiable conditions. She and Gereon part ways after gathering up their respective files they had dropped. Two [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]] named Kardakow and Svetlana receive a telegram at a printing shop,  alerting them that the train will arrive soon.       \n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|df=yes|2017|10|13|}}\n |LineColor = #5DBCD2\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 2\n |Title = Episode 2\n |ShortSummary = Gereon interrogates Johann K\u00f6nig, who had been tortured by a mysterious man before the interrogation. K\u00f6nig seizes the inspector's handgun and wants to shoot Gereon, but after Gereon convinces him that his situation is hopeless, Johann commits suicide instead. This triggers Gereon's PTSD, so he rushes to nearby toilets to take some morphine, but is unable to do so because of his heavy trembling. Charlotte, in the neighbouring stall, finds him and helps him take his drugs. After this incident, Gereon phones with his father, who is disappointed that the film has not been found, and urges his son to destroy it, should it reappear. Gereon and Bruno are summoned into the office of August Benda, head of the police, to explain why K\u00f6nig was injured after Bruno's interrogation, but neither of them tells the truth. Benda has a private conversation with Gereon and asks him why he had been transferred. Gereon admits that his friend [[Konrad Adenauer]], the mayor of Cologne, was blackmailed with a film that is said to be in Berlin. Adenauer asked Gereon to find it before the upcoming elections. Gereon finds Krajewski, who can't tell him anything about the film. At night, Charlotte visits the Moka Efti, a popular [[variety show|variety theater]]. She listens to a singer called Nikoros, who is actually Svetlana in disguise. Charlotte follows one of the patrons to the club's basement, which houses a brothel where she works as a [[prostitute]] to supplement her family's income.

When the driver gets suspicious, Svetlana threatens him with a gun, but gets stopped by German rail workers and is arrested. The driver goes to Kardakow's pension, which happens to now be Gereon's. The next day, Benda says during a speech that communist associations have planned to demonstrate on [[International Workers' Day|1 May]] even though such rallies have been banned in Berlin. When Gereon refuses to tell Bruno anything about his conversation with Benda, Bruno gets angry and arranges that the two of them will oversee the demonstrations together. Gereon returns to his rooming house, where he finds the landlady, Elisabeth Behnke, gagged. He and the Russian engine driver get into a fistfight, and Gereon is able to throw him over a balcony. When the driver then gets kidnapped on the street, Gereon tries to intervene, but fails to save him. The driver gets taken to a warehouse where he is questioned by Trochin, the Soviet ambassador.

Nyssen looks on with satisfaction, Helga Rath at his side. Flashback to five weeks earlier. Rath has recovered from his PTSD and sets aside his medication.  Ritter goes to a women's prison where she pleads unsuccessfully for the release of Greta Overbeck, who refuses all visits from her. Walter Weintraub is fingerprinted and released from prison. A car is waiting with a woman named Vera, whom he blindfolds, has violent sex with, and takes her earrings as a present for the Armenian's daughter.  During the filming of a movie, a hooded figure boobytraps a spotlight, which kills the star (Betty Winter, wife of homosexual Tristian Rot).   Bellman, a producer, informs the Armenian of the incident. Ritter aces her crime-scene reenactment exam, but later stumbles over a technical detail and is unfairly failed by the detail-obsessed Ullrich.  At the film studio, the producer gives Rath an electrician's file and urgently tries to get him to declare the death an accident.  At the Armenian's house, Weintraub is greeted affectionately and he takes a satchel. Weintraub and Esther exchange glances. The two men visit Moka Efti which has been damaged in an explosion. Alfred Nyssen and his mother are reassured that the stock market is booming. She indicates she wants to invest $45&nbsp;million in Ahrensen's consortium.  Later, Alfred admits his bipolar condition and his suspicions about a coming crash, which he [[Antisemitism|blames on Jewish]] financial manipulation. He orders Wegener to illegally obtain the client lists of the major banks.  Helga gives a specimen for a pregnancy test. Meanwhile, Rath reviews the footage of Betty's death and notices one actress, Tilly Brooks (an alias for Mathilde Spielman), is acting strangely. As they examine the wreckage of the Moka Efti, the Armenian tells Weintraub that it was no accident, neither was Betty's death.  He states he has been suspicious of the production and he thinks he knows who is behind the \"accidents.\" He explains how he covered things up at the murder scene as a million-dollar investment is at stake. Ritter and her sister, Toni, come home and clean up after their messy co-tenant. Instead of going home where Helga is waiting, Rath enters a secret room where Dr. Schmidt gets him to chant, \"To the truth.

The widow Benda gives passionate testimony against her.  Rath wants to review her files, but they are sealed by order of Wendt who promises Mrs. Benda to find the Nazis who put Greta up to it.  Wendt tries to get Commissioner Zorgiebel to resign by threatening another trial about police shootings of communists.  Rath sympathizes with him against Wendt, but is refused permission to interrogate Greta again.  Rath questions the electrician who was identified as being in charge of the spotlight that killed Betty, but it is revealed that Felix Krempin had impersonated him.  Bellman is told that the death will not be deemed an accident, and therefore insurance won't cover the losses.  Ritter is told by Toni that her mother left something with a neighbor that only Charlotte can collect.  Rath runs into Tilly.  She knows him from the Pepita Bar and tells him that she saw a ghostlike man in a cloak when the spotlight fell. Ritter has her work with a sketch artist while Toni waits in a restaurant.  Tilly confides that Betty and Rot argued about going to America.  Rath confronts Wendt about the sealed Overbeck files.  Wendt states there is no Nazi connection, and blames the Communists.  He tells Rath to focus instead on Hans Litten, a Communist Party lawyer, who he says is demanding that Zorgiebel be put on trial.  Edgar and his banker (who is Esther's brother-in-law) argue over each losing $1&nbsp;million on the movie.  Edgar makes a veiled threat.  Helga is given a key to an expensive hotel room under her maiden name where she waits.   Meanwhile her son is recruited by the Hitler Youth.  Rath shares his suspicions with Ritter that Wendt is covering up for Nazis and they agree to try to help Greta.  Nyssen meets with Wendt at his estate and tells him he must handle Greta's interfering testimony and distance her from the Nazi party or there will be no more assistance.  Weintraub and the Armenian violently pressure Bellman to complete the film despite the loss of the female lead.  Esther smokes opium and looks at a picture. Ritter and Toni dream of a better future.

Next morning Helga, packed, leaves with Moritz.  They go to the elegant hotel room.  Heymann, the editor of TEMPO magazine, nixes Katelbach\u2019s piece on how Lufthansa is helping the Reichswehr in favor of the more sensational Betty Winter/Krempin story. Heymann returns a call to Hans Litten\u2019s office.  Rath receives the preliminary ballistics report on Krempin\u2019s murder weapon.  Sebald locates Greta\u2019s child in an orphanage and takes custody in Wendt\u2019s name. Esther informs Bellman that the Armenian\u2019s own money is on the line. He begs for her help and they strategize.  Rath brings Gennat up to speed on the case. Gennat gives an irrelevant lecture to reporters on his crime statistics. They only want to hear about Betty & Rot.  Wegener, posing as a securities auditor, gathers investment information from various middle-class people.  He reports to Alfred Nyssen that they all borrowed and invested bank money way beyond their means.  Nyssen realizes a collapse is inevitable. Menacingly, Wendt shows Greta her baby through a prison window. Ullrich tries to tell Gennat about a ballistics match on the Krempin gun but is shut down for violating chain of command.  He sees a beetle on its back and decides not to tell anyone about his discovery.  Katelbach receives a confidential document in a clandestine exchange.  On the way to the studio, Rath admits he knows Tilly from somewhere besides the movies. Bellman and the banker are trying to convince Tristan Rot to do something he doesn\u2019t want to do regarding Betty\u2019s replacement.  Rath interrogates Rot who recognizes the picture of the cloaked figure and admits to an occult connection to Krempin.  Ritter runs into Vera, a fellow working girl from the past, there to audition.  Weintraub gets rough with the insurance adjustor who has denied Edgar\u2019s claim. Bellman calls to warn Edgar about police at the studio.  Weintraub and Edgar argue.  Edgar punches Weintraub, who inauthentically capitulates.  Ritter thinks she sees the cloaked figure, but it turns out to be Rot\u2019s stand-in with a wooden leg, Aiden.  A second copy of the cloak is missing.  The seamstress admits Krempin got her to steal it, but is sure he is innocent because he left hours before the spotlight fell after receiving a phone call.  Tilly auditions in a duet with Rot while Weintraub pulls Rath aside.  Against Bellman\u2019s wishes, Weintraub calls a halt to casting and Tilly gets the part.  Vera angrily confronts him.  Rath and the Armenian find they have common interests in finding the killer as well as both being ex-addicts and patients of Schmidt. Edgar warns that the cure has a price and gives him a slip of paper.  Tilly apologizes to Vera for getting the role, but Vera locks her in the dressing room and assumes her place on set, as Weintraub looks on smiling.

Gennat lectures her about protocol. Annoyed, Rath finds out he must work with Bohm, who is now lead on the case. Bohm reports that a butcher, a pyrotechnician, and a beverage supplier all had access to the crime scene. Gennat reassigns Ritter to work with Bohm as trainee.  Unhappy, Bohm later sends her on a wild goose chase.  Graf brings in underexposed crime scene photos and gets chewed out.  Rath tells Ritter that Greta recanted and Greta gets attacked by Dr. Volcker in prison who demands to know why.  Greta refuses to say.  Bohm looks up stock quotes for Dresden Bank and later insinuates to his family that he may be coming into some money.  Rath walks in on Ullrich who is injecting insulin for diabetes. Czerwinski and Henning get drunk while interviewing the beverage supplier who tells them he gave Rot the key to the courtyard just before the murder.

Bohm breaks it up with a gunshot.  Schmidt scurries off, seen by Rath (who calls him \u201cAnno\u201d) and gives Rath a hypnotic command to forget he saw him.  Next day at breakfast Rath admits to Katelbach that he was toeing the company line when he gave his testimony in the Zorgiebel case.

The engine driver and a train worker are ambushed by several armed, [[Russian language|Russian]]-speaking men. The men couple an additional car to the train, and two Russian men replace the Germans who are killed by shots to the head. Meanwhile, Gereon Rath, a [[morphine]] addict and [[World War I]] veteran who worked as a police inspector in [[Cologne]] is transferred to Berlin. He and his new partner, Bruno Wolter, visit a photographic studio which is actually a pornographic film set and production studio. As they arrest Johann K\u00f6nig, the owner, another man flees, and shoots at Gereon, but is subdued by Bruno. Bruno lets him go since the man is Franz Krajewski, one of his informants. He fought in World War I and was fired from his job as a policeman because he overreacted in a shoot-out, due to his [[PTSD]]. Franz goes to a therapist (Dr Schmidt), revealing that the police arrested K\u00f6nig and are looking for \"the film\". The therapist later meets with a mysterious man, referred to only as \"The Armenian\". The Armenian says he will take care of the film. At the police station, Gereon bumps into Charlotte Ritter after stepping out of a [[paternoster lift]]. She works as an archivist at the homicide division in order to provide for her family who live under pitiable conditions. She and Gereon part ways after gathering up their respective files they had dropped. Two [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]] named Kardakow and Svetlana receive a telegram at a printing shop,  alerting them that the train will arrive soon.       \n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|df=yes|2017|10|13|}}\n |LineColor = #5DBCD2\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 2\n |Title = Episode 2\n |ShortSummary = Gereon interrogates Johann K\u00f6nig, who had been tortured by a mysterious man before the interrogation. K\u00f6nig seizes the inspector's handgun and wants to shoot Gereon, but after Gereon convinces him that his situation is hopeless, Johann commits suicide instead. This triggers Gereon's PTSD, so he rushes to nearby toilets to take some morphine, but is unable to do so because of his heavy trembling. Charlotte, in the neighbouring stall, finds him and helps him take his drugs. After this incident, Gereon phones with his father, who is disappointed that the film has not been found, and urges his son to destroy it, should it reappear. Gereon and Bruno are summoned into the office of August Benda, head of the police, to explain why K\u00f6nig was injured after Bruno's interrogation, but neither of them tells the truth. Benda has a private conversation with Gereon and asks him why he had been transferred. Gereon admits that his friend [[Konrad Adenauer]], the mayor of Cologne, was blackmailed with a film that is said to be in Berlin. Adenauer asked Gereon to find it before the upcoming elections. Gereon finds Krajewski, who can't tell him anything about the film. At night, Charlotte visits the Moka Efti, a popular [[variety show|variety theater]]. She listens to a singer called Nikoros, who is actually Svetlana in disguise. Charlotte follows one of the patrons to the club's basement, which houses a brothel where she works as a [[prostitute]] to supplement her family's income.

The next day, Benda says during a speech that communist associations have planned to demonstrate on [[International Workers' Day|1 May]] even though such rallies have been banned in Berlin. When Gereon refuses to tell Bruno anything about his conversation with Benda, Bruno gets angry and arranges that the two of them will oversee the demonstrations together. Gereon returns to his rooming house, where he finds the landlady, Elisabeth Behnke, gagged. He and the Russian engine driver get into a fistfight, and Gereon is able to throw him over a balcony. When the driver then gets kidnapped on the street, Gereon tries to intervene, but fails to save him. The driver gets taken to a warehouse where he is questioned by Trochin, the Soviet ambassador.

Nyssen looks on with satisfaction, Helga Rath at his side. Flashback to five weeks earlier. Rath has recovered from his PTSD and sets aside his medication.  Ritter goes to a women's prison where she pleads unsuccessfully for the release of Greta Overbeck, who refuses all visits from her. Walter Weintraub is fingerprinted and released from prison. A car is waiting with a woman named Vera, whom he blindfolds, has violent sex with, and takes her earrings as a present for the Armenian's daughter.  During the filming of a movie, a hooded figure boobytraps a spotlight, which kills the star (Betty Winter, wife of homosexual Tristian Rot).   Bellman, a producer, informs the Armenian of the incident. Ritter aces her crime-scene reenactment exam, but later stumbles over a technical detail and is unfairly failed by the detail-obsessed Ullrich.  At the film studio, the producer gives Rath an electrician's file and urgently tries to get him to declare the death an accident.  At the Armenian's house, Weintraub is greeted affectionately and he takes a satchel. Weintraub and Esther exchange glances. The two men visit Moka Efti which has been damaged in an explosion. Alfred Nyssen and his mother are reassured that the stock market is booming. She indicates she wants to invest $45&nbsp;million in Ahrensen's consortium.  Later, Alfred admits his bipolar condition and his suspicions about a coming crash, which he [[Antisemitism|blames on Jewish]] financial manipulation. He orders Wegener to illegally obtain the client lists of the major banks.  Helga gives a specimen for a pregnancy test. Meanwhile, Rath reviews the footage of Betty's death and notices one actress, Tilly Brooks (an alias for Mathilde Spielman), is acting strangely.

He states he has been suspicious of the production and he thinks he knows who is behind the \"accidents.\" He explains how he covered things up at the murder scene as a million-dollar investment is at stake. Ritter and her sister, Toni, come home and clean up after their messy co-tenant.

The widow Benda gives passionate testimony against her.  Rath wants to review her files, but they are sealed by order of Wendt who promises Mrs. Benda to find the Nazis who put Greta up to it.  Wendt tries to get Commissioner Zorgiebel to resign by threatening another trial about police shootings of communists.  Rath sympathizes with him against Wendt, but is refused permission to interrogate Greta again.  Rath questions the electrician who was identified as being in charge of the spotlight that killed Betty, but it is revealed that Felix Krempin had impersonated him.  Bellman is told that the death will not be deemed an accident, and therefore insurance won't cover the losses.  Ritter is told by Toni that her mother left something with a neighbor that only Charlotte can collect.  Rath runs into Tilly.  She knows him from the Pepita Bar and tells him that she saw a ghostlike man in a cloak when the spotlight fell. Ritter has her work with a sketch artist while Toni waits in a restaurant.  Tilly confides that Betty and Rot argued about going to America.  Rath confronts Wendt about the sealed Overbeck files.  Wendt states there is no Nazi connection, and blames the Communists.  He tells Rath to focus instead on Hans Litten, a Communist Party lawyer, who he says is demanding that Zorgiebel be put on trial.  Edgar and his banker (who is Esther's brother-in-law) argue over each losing $1&nbsp;million on the movie.  Edgar makes a veiled threat.  Helga is given a key to an expensive hotel room under her maiden name where she waits.   Meanwhile her son is recruited by the Hitler Youth.  Rath shares his suspicions with Ritter that Wendt is covering up for Nazis and they agree to try to help Greta.  Nyssen meets with Wendt at his estate and tells him he must handle Greta's interfering testimony and distance her from the Nazi party or there will be no more assistance.

Heymann, the editor of TEMPO magazine, nixes Katelbach\u2019s piece on how Lufthansa is helping the Reichswehr in favor of the more sensational Betty Winter/Krempin story. Heymann returns a call to Hans Litten\u2019s office.  Rath receives the preliminary ballistics report on Krempin\u2019s murder weapon.  Sebald locates Greta\u2019s child in an orphanage and takes custody in Wendt\u2019s name. Esther informs Bellman that the Armenian\u2019s own money is on the line. He begs for her help and they strategize.  Rath brings Gennat up to speed on the case. Gennat gives an irrelevant lecture to reporters on his crime statistics. They only want to hear about Betty & Rot.  Wegener, posing as a securities auditor, gathers investment information from various middle-class people.  He reports to Alfred Nyssen that they all borrowed and invested bank money way beyond their means.  Nyssen realizes a collapse is inevitable. Menacingly, Wendt shows Greta her baby through a prison window. Ullrich tries to tell Gennat about a ballistics match on the Krempin gun but is shut down for violating chain of command.  He sees a beetle on its back and decides not to tell anyone about his discovery.  Katelbach receives a confidential document in a clandestine exchange.  On the way to the studio, Rath admits he knows Tilly from somewhere besides the movies. Bellman and the banker are trying to convince Tristan Rot to do something he doesn\u2019t want to do regarding Betty\u2019s replacement.  Rath interrogates Rot who recognizes the picture of the cloaked figure and admits to an occult connection to Krempin.  Ritter runs into Vera, a fellow working girl from the past, there to audition.  Weintraub gets rough with the insurance adjustor who has denied Edgar\u2019s claim. Bellman calls to warn Edgar about police at the studio.  Weintraub and Edgar argue.  Edgar punches Weintraub, who inauthentically capitulates.  Ritter thinks she sees the cloaked figure, but it turns out to be Rot\u2019s stand-in with a wooden leg, Aiden.  A second copy of the cloak is missing.  The seamstress admits Krempin got her to steal it, but is sure he is innocent because he left hours before the spotlight fell after receiving a phone call.  Tilly auditions in a duet with Rot while Weintraub pulls Rath aside.  Against Bellman\u2019s wishes, Weintraub calls a halt to casting and Tilly gets the part.  Vera angrily confronts him.  Rath and the Armenian find they have common interests in finding the killer as well as both being ex-addicts and patients of Schmidt. Edgar warns that the cure has a price and gives him a slip of paper.  Tilly apologizes to Vera for getting the role, but Vera locks her in the dressing room and assumes her place on set, as Weintraub looks on smiling.

Gennat lectures her about protocol. Annoyed, Rath finds out he must work with Bohm, who is now lead on the case. Bohm reports that a butcher, a pyrotechnician, and a beverage supplier all had access to the crime scene. Gennat reassigns Ritter to work with Bohm as trainee.  Unhappy, Bohm later sends her on a wild goose chase.  Graf brings in underexposed crime scene photos and gets chewed out.  Rath tells Ritter that Greta recanted and Greta gets attacked by Dr. Volcker in prison who demands to know why.  Greta refuses to say.  Bohm looks up stock quotes for Dresden Bank and later insinuates to his family that he may be coming into some money.  Rath walks in on Ullrich who is injecting insulin for diabetes. Czerwinski and Henning get drunk while interviewing the beverage supplier who tells them he gave Rot the key to the courtyard just before the murder.
