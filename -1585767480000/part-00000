The area includes the sub-district of [[Finsbury]].\n\nClerkenwell was an ancient parish from the mediaeval period onwards, becoming part of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Finsbury]] from 1900 to 1965, an authority which in turn merged into the modern [[London Borough of Islington]].\n\nThe well after which it was named was rediscovered in 1924. The watchmaking and watch repairing trades were once of great \nimportance.<ref>Moore, W. G. (1971) ''The Penguin Encyclopedia of Places''. Harmondsworth: Penguin Books; p. 178</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n''For a list of street name etymologies in the Clerkenwell area see [[Street names of Clerkenwell and Finsbury]].''\n\n===Clerks' Well===\nClerkenwell took its name from the Clerks' Well in Farringdon Lane (''clerken'' was the [[Middle English#Nouns|Middle English]] genitive plural of ''clerk'', a variant of  ''[[wikt:clerc#Middle English|clerc]]'', meaning literate person or clergyman). In the [[Middle Ages]], the [[Parish Clerks Company|London Parish clerks]] performed annual [[mystery play]]s there, based on biblical themes. Part of the well remains visible, incorporated into a 1980s building called Well Court. It is visible through a window of that building on Farringdon Lane. Access to the well is managed by [[Islington Local History Centre]] and visits can be arranged by appointment.\n\n===Monastic traditions===\nThe Monastic Order of the [[Knights Hospitaller]]s of [[John the Apostle|St John]] of [[Jerusalem]] had its English headquarters at the [[Priory of Clerkenwell]]. ([[The Blessed Gerard]] founded the Order to provide medical assistance during [[the crusades]].) [[St John's Gate, Clerkenwell|St John's Gate]] (built by Sir [[Thomas Docwra]] in 1504) survives in the rebuilt form of the Priory Gate. Its gateway, erected in 1504 in St John's Square, served various purposes after the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]]. For example, it was the birthplace of the ''[[Gentleman's Magazine]]'' in 1731, and the scene of [[Dr Johnson]]'s work in connection with that journal. [[File:Clerkenwell 1805 Cartographer; Tyrer, James.jpg|thumb|Clerkenwell in 1805]] In modern times the gatehouse again became associated with the order and was in the early 20th century the headquarters of the [[St John Ambulance]] Association. An [[Early English Period|Early English]] [[crypt]] remains beneath the chapel of the order, which was otherwise mostly rebuilt in the 1950s after wartime bombing. The notorious deception of the \"[[Cock Lane Ghost]]\", in which Johnson took great interest, was perpetrated nearby.\n\nAdjoining the priory was [[St James Church, Clerkenwell#Nunnery of St Mary: c. 1100 - 1539|St Mary's nunnery]] of the Benedictine order, now entirely disappeared, and [[St James Church, Clerkenwell|St James's Church]], rebuilt in 1792 on the site of the original church which was partly of [[Norman architecture|Norman]] provenance. The [[London Charterhouse|Charterhouse]], near the boundary with the [[City of London]], was originally a [[Carthusian]] [[monastery]]. Following the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] the Charterhouse became a private mansion and one owner, Thomas Sutton, subsequently left it with an endowment as a school and [[almshouse]]. The almhouse remains but the school relocated to Surrey and its part of the site is now a campus of [[Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry]].\n\n===Notoriety===\nAs it was a suburb beyond the confines of the [[London Wall]], Clerkenwell was outside the jurisdiction of the somewhat puritanical City fathers. Consequently, \"base tenements and houses of unlawful and disorderly resort\" sprang up, with a \"great number of dissolute, loose, and insolent people harboured in such and the like noisome and disorderly houses, as namely poor cottages, and habitations of beggars and people without trade, stables, inns, alehouses, taverns, garden-houses converted to dwellings, ordinaries, dicing houses, bowling alleys, and brothel houses\".<ref>Middlesex Justices in 1596; cited in Schoenbaum 1987, p. 126.</ref>\n\nDuring the Elizabethan era Clerkenwell contained a notorious brothel quarter. In Shakespeare's ''[[Henry IV, Part 2]]'', Falstaff complains about Justice Shallow boasting of \"the wildness of his youth, and the feats he has done about Turnbull Street\".<ref>William Shakespeare, ''[[Henry IV, Part 2]]''. Act 3, Scene 2.</ref> Known now as Turnmill Street and adjoining [[Farringdon station]], it had an infamous reputation for brothel-keeping and was described in Sugden's ''Topographical Dictionary'' as \"the most disreputable street in London, a haunt of thieves and loose women\".<ref>Nicholl C. (2007) ''The Lodger'', p.204.</ref> The [[Clerkenwell Bridewell]], a prison and correctional institute for prostitutes and vagrants, was known for savage punishment and endemic sexual corruption.\n\n===Fashionable residential area===\nIn the 17th century South Clerkenwell became a fashionable place of residence. [[Oliver Cromwell]] owned a house on Clerkenwell Close, just off the Green.

The House of Detention was demolished in 1890 but the extensive vaults and cells beneath, now known as the Clerkenwell Catacombs, remained. They were reopened as air raid shelters during the Blitz, and for a few years were open as a minor tourist attraction. Various film scenes have been shot in the catacombs.\n\n===Industrial Revolution===\nThe [[Industrial Revolution]] changed the area greatly. It became a centre for [[brewery|breweries]], [[distillation|distilleries]] and the [[printing]] industry. It gained an especial reputation for the [[clockmaker|making of clocks]], [[marine chronometer]]s and [[watchmaker|watches]], which activity once employed many people from around the area. Flourishing craft workshops still carry on some of the traditional trades, such as jewellery-making. Clerkenwell was home to [http://www.witherbys.london/ Witherbys] a printing company who have now relocated to North London. (see also [[Witherby Seamanship]]), \nIt was during the Industrial Revolution that Clerkenwell became known as London's Italian district, although the total number of Italian residents probably numbered no more than 2,000 at any one time.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n[[File:Article-1204508-05F33865000005DC-837 964x691.jpg|thumb|Kodak Building at 41\u201343 Clerkenwell Rd, London in 1902]]\nThe Kodak United Company opened a factory and storefront at 41\u201343 Clerkenwell and took advantage of the surplus of unemployed Jewelers and Watch makers to build their Stereoscopic and Folding Pocket Cameras that they produced and repaired.

It was built in 1782, extended during the [[Victorian era]], and by the early 21st century used as a [[Masonic]] hall. The name is something of a historical relic - Clerkenwell Green has had no grass for over 300 years. However, in conveying some impression of its history, it gives the appearance of one of the better-preserved village centres in what is now [[central London]]. In [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[Oliver Twist]]'', Clerkenwell Green is where [[Fagin]] and the [[Artful Dodger]] induct Oliver into [[pickpocket]]ing amongst shoppers in the busy market once held there. In his words it is \"an open square in Clerkenwell, which is yet called, by some perversion of terms the Green\", despite lacking any \"greenery\". Indeed, Dickens knew the area well and was a customer of the Finsbury Savings Bank on [[Thomas Seckford|Sekforde Street]], which links Clerkenwell Green to St John Street.\n\n===Radicalism===\nClerkenwell Green has historically been associated with radicalism, from the [[Lollards]] in the 16th century, the [[Chartists]] in the 19th century and [[communists]] in the early 20th century.<ref>Andrew Rothstein, ''A House on Clerkenwell Green'', London: Lawrence & Wishart, 1966.

In the 1920s and 1930s, 37a Clerkenwell Green was a venue for Communist Party meetings, and the [[Marx Memorial Library]] was founded on the same site in 1933. Clerkenwell's tradition of left-leaning publication continued until late 2008 with ''[[The Guardian]]'' and ''[[The Observer]]'' having their headquarters on Farringdon Road, a short walk from the Green. Their new offices are a short distance away in [[King's Cross, London|King's Cross]]. In 2011, an [[2011 anti-cuts protest in London|anti-cuts protest]] march departed from Clerkenwell and ended with a rally at [[Trafalgar Square]] demanding trade union rights, human rights and international solidarity.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-13254761 | work=BBC News | title=May Day: Thousands participate in rally | date=1 May 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Local government===\n[[File:Finsbury Met.

However, for civil matters they remained a single parish. The parish vestry became a nominating authority to the [[Metropolitan Board of Works]] in 1855.\n\nUnder the [[Metropolis Management Act 1855]] any parish that exceeded 2,000 [[Rates in the United Kingdom|ratepayers]] was to be divided into wards; as such the incorporated vestry of St James & St John Clerkenwell was divided into five wards (electing [[vestrymen]]): No. 1 (12), No. 2 (15), No. 3 (12), No. 4 (18) and No. 5 (15).<ref>{{cite book|title=The London Gazette Issue: 21802|date=20 October 1855|pages=3887\u20133888|url=https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/21802/page/3887|accessdate=8 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe area of the metropolitan board became the [[County of London]] in 1889. A reform of local government in 1900 abolished the Clerkenwell vestry and the parish became part of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Finsbury]]. [[Alexandra Park, London|Alexandra Park]], an exclave of the parish, was transferred to [[Hornsey]], Middlesex at the same time.<ref name=vision/> Clerkenwell Town Hall, which had been built on [[Rosebery Avenue]] in 1895, became [[Finsbury Town Hall]]. [[Finsbury]] became part of the [[London Borough of Islington]] in 1965 and the old town hall lay empty and deteriorating for many years. It has since been sold to the Urdang Dance Academy.\n\n===Post-war de-industrialisation and revival===\nAfter the [[Second World War]] Clerkenwell suffered from [[deindustrialization|industrial decline]] and many of the premises occupied by the engineering, printing publishing and meat and food trades (the last mostly around Smithfield) fell empty. Several acclaimed council housing estates were commissioned by [[Metropolitan Borough of Finsbury|Finsbury Borough Council]]. Modernist architect and [[Russia]]n \u00e9migr\u00e9 [[Berthold Lubetkin]]'s listed Spa Green Estate, constructed 1943\u20131950, has recently been restored. The [[Finsbury Estate]], constructed in 1968 to the designs of Joseph Emberton includes flats, since altered and re-clad.\n\nA general revival and gentrification process began in the 1980s, and the area is now known for loft-living in some of the former industrial buildings. It also has [[Yuppie|young professionals]], nightclubs and restaurants and is home to many professional offices as an overspill for the nearby [[City of London]] and [[West End of London|West End]]. Amongst other sectors, there is a notable concentration of design professions around Clerkenwell, and supporting industries such as high-end designer furniture showrooms.

The community had mostly dispersed by the 1960s, but the area remains the 'spiritual home' of London's Italians, and is a focal point for more recent Italian immigrants, largely because of [[St Peter's Italian Church]].

The area includes the sub-district of [[Finsbury]].\n\nClerkenwell was an ancient parish from the mediaeval period onwards, becoming part of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Finsbury]] from 1900 to 1965, an authority which in turn merged into the modern [[London Borough of Islington]].\n\nThe well after which it was named was rediscovered in 1924. The watchmaking and watch repairing trades were once of great \nimportance.<ref>Moore, W. G. (1971) ''The Penguin Encyclopedia of Places''. Harmondsworth: Penguin Books; p. 178</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n''For a list of street name etymologies in the Clerkenwell area see [[Street names of Clerkenwell and Finsbury]].''\n\n===Clerks' Well===\nClerkenwell took its name from the Clerks' Well in Farringdon Lane (''clerken'' was the [[Middle English#Nouns|Middle English]] genitive plural of ''clerk'', a variant of  ''[[wikt:clerc#Middle English|clerc]]'', meaning literate person or clergyman). In the [[Middle Ages]], the [[Parish Clerks Company|London Parish clerks]] performed annual [[mystery play]]s there, based on biblical themes. Part of the well remains visible, incorporated into a 1980s building called Well Court. It is visible through a window of that building on Farringdon Lane. Access to the well is managed by [[Islington Local History Centre]] and visits can be arranged by appointment.\n\n===Monastic traditions===\nThe Monastic Order of the [[Knights Hospitaller]]s of [[John the Apostle|St John]] of [[Jerusalem]] had its English headquarters at the [[Priory of Clerkenwell]]. ([[The Blessed Gerard]] founded the Order to provide medical assistance during [[the crusades]].) [[St John's Gate, Clerkenwell|St John's Gate]] (built by Sir [[Thomas Docwra]] in 1504) survives in the rebuilt form of the Priory Gate. Its gateway, erected in 1504 in St John's Square, served various purposes after the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]]. For example, it was the birthplace of the ''[[Gentleman's Magazine]]'' in 1731, and the scene of [[Dr Johnson]]'s work in connection with that journal. [[File:Clerkenwell 1805 Cartographer; Tyrer, James.jpg|thumb|Clerkenwell in 1805]] In modern times the gatehouse again became associated with the order and was in the early 20th century the headquarters of the [[St John Ambulance]] Association. An [[Early English Period|Early English]] [[crypt]] remains beneath the chapel of the order, which was otherwise mostly rebuilt in the 1950s after wartime bombing. The notorious deception of the \"[[Cock Lane Ghost]]\", in which Johnson took great interest, was perpetrated nearby.\n\nAdjoining the priory was [[St James Church, Clerkenwell#Nunnery of St Mary: c. 1100 - 1539|St Mary's nunnery]] of the Benedictine order, now entirely disappeared, and [[St James Church, Clerkenwell|St James's Church]], rebuilt in 1792 on the site of the original church which was partly of [[Norman architecture|Norman]] provenance. The [[London Charterhouse|Charterhouse]], near the boundary with the [[City of London]], was originally a [[Carthusian]] [[monastery]]. Following the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] the Charterhouse became a private mansion and one owner, Thomas Sutton, subsequently left it with an endowment as a school and [[almshouse]]. The almhouse remains but the school relocated to Surrey and its part of the site is now a campus of [[Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry]].\n\n===Notoriety===\nAs it was a suburb beyond the confines of the [[London Wall]], Clerkenwell was outside the jurisdiction of the somewhat puritanical City fathers. Consequently, \"base tenements and houses of unlawful and disorderly resort\" sprang up, with a \"great number of dissolute, loose, and insolent people harboured in such and the like noisome and disorderly houses, as namely poor cottages, and habitations of beggars and people without trade, stables, inns, alehouses, taverns, garden-houses converted to dwellings, ordinaries, dicing houses, bowling alleys, and brothel houses\".<ref>Middlesex Justices in 1596; cited in Schoenbaum 1987, p. 126.</ref>\n\nDuring the Elizabethan era Clerkenwell contained a notorious brothel quarter. In Shakespeare's ''[[Henry IV, Part 2]]'', Falstaff complains about Justice Shallow boasting of \"the wildness of his youth, and the feats he has done about Turnbull Street\".<ref>William Shakespeare, ''[[Henry IV, Part 2]]''. Act 3, Scene 2.</ref> Known now as Turnmill Street and adjoining [[Farringdon station]], it had an infamous reputation for brothel-keeping and was described in Sugden's ''Topographical Dictionary'' as \"the most disreputable street in London, a haunt of thieves and loose women\".<ref>Nicholl C. (2007) ''The Lodger'', p.204.</ref> The [[Clerkenwell Bridewell]], a prison and correctional institute for prostitutes and vagrants, was known for savage punishment and endemic sexual corruption.\n\n===Fashionable residential area===\nIn the 17th century South Clerkenwell became a fashionable place of residence. [[Oliver Cromwell]] owned a house on Clerkenwell Close, just off the Green. Several aristocrats had houses there, most notably the [[Duke of Northumberland]],{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} as did people such as [[Erasmus Smith]].<ref name=ODNB>{{ODNBweb|id=25796|title=Smith, Erasmus}}</ref> Before Clerkenwell became a built-up area, it had a reputation as a [[resort]] a short walk out of the city, where Londoners could disport themselves at its [[day spa|spa]]s, of which there were several, based on natural [[chalybeate]] springs, [[tea garden]]s and [[theater (structure)|theatre]]s. The present day [[Sadler's Wells]] has survived as heir to this tradition, after being rebuilt many times and many changes of use including pleasure gardens, theatre, aquatic display venue, circus and music hall. Today it is a leading theatre<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theresident.co.uk/london-culture-events/things-to-do-london-june-2019/|title=45 of the Best Things to Do in London: June 2019|access-date=2019-06-04}}</ref> and modern dance venue.\n\n===Prisons===\n\nClerkenwell was also the location of three prisons: the [[Clerkenwell Bridewell]], [[Coldbath Fields Prison]] (later Clerkenwell Gaol) and the [[New Prison]], later the [[Clerkenwell House of Detention]], notorious as the scene of the [[Clerkenwell Outrage]] in 1867, an attempted prison break by [[Fenian]]s who killed many in the tenement houses on Corporation Row in trying to blow a hole in the prison wall. The House of Detention was demolished in 1890 but the extensive vaults and cells beneath, now known as the Clerkenwell Catacombs, remained. They were reopened as air raid shelters during the Blitz, and for a few years were open as a minor tourist attraction. Various film scenes have been shot in the catacombs.\n\n===Industrial Revolution===\nThe [[Industrial Revolution]] changed the area greatly. It became a centre for [[brewery|breweries]], [[distillation|distilleries]] and the [[printing]] industry. It gained an especial reputation for the [[clockmaker|making of clocks]], [[marine chronometer]]s and [[watchmaker|watches]], which activity once employed many people from around the area. Flourishing craft workshops still carry on some of the traditional trades, such as jewellery-making. Clerkenwell was home to [http://www.witherbys.london/ Witherbys] a printing company who have now relocated to North London. (see also [[Witherby Seamanship]]), \nIt was during the Industrial Revolution that Clerkenwell became known as London's Italian district, although the total number of Italian residents probably numbered no more than 2,000 at any one time.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n[[File:Article-1204508-05F33865000005DC-837 964x691.jpg|thumb|Kodak Building at 41\u201343 Clerkenwell Rd, London in 1902]]\nThe Kodak United Company opened a factory and storefront at 41\u201343 Clerkenwell and took advantage of the surplus of unemployed Jewelers and Watch makers to build their Stereoscopic and Folding Pocket Cameras that they produced and repaired.  The location also allowed them easy access to the chemicals required for their Bromide based papers and negatives.  During the war they were relocated for security reasons because of the fear that Axis bombs would destroy the photographic equipment used for the war effort.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.earlyphotography.co.uk/site/companies2.html#kodak|title=Information on Camera Makers and Companies - Antique and Vintage Cameras|website=www.earlyphotography.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n===Clerkenwell Green===\n[[File:Clerkenwell Green, Londra.jpg|thumb|Clerkenwell Green]]\nClerkenwell Green lies at the centre of the old village, by the church, and has a mixture of housing, offices and pubs, dominated by the imposing former [[Middlesex Sessions House]]. It was built in 1782, extended during the [[Victorian era]], and by the early 21st century used as a [[Masonic]] hall. The name is something of a historical relic - Clerkenwell Green has had no grass for over 300 years. However, in conveying some impression of its history, it gives the appearance of one of the better-preserved village centres in what is now [[central London]]. In [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[Oliver Twist]]'', Clerkenwell Green is where [[Fagin]] and the [[Artful Dodger]] induct Oliver into [[pickpocket]]ing amongst shoppers in the busy market once held there. In his words it is \"an open square in Clerkenwell, which is yet called, by some perversion of terms the Green\", despite lacking any \"greenery\". Indeed, Dickens knew the area well and was a customer of the Finsbury Savings Bank on [[Thomas Seckford|Sekforde Street]], which links Clerkenwell Green to St John Street.\n\n===Radicalism===\nClerkenwell Green has historically been associated with radicalism, from the [[Lollards]] in the 16th century, the [[Chartists]] in the 19th century and [[communists]] in the early 20th century.<ref>Andrew Rothstein, ''A House on Clerkenwell Green'', London: Lawrence & Wishart, 1966. A history of 37a Clerkenwell Green and activism in the area.</ref> In 1902, [[Vladimir Lenin]] moved the publication of the ''[[Iskra]]'' (Spark) to the British [[Social Democratic Federation]] at 37a Clerkenwell Green, and issues 22 to 38 were indeed edited there. At that time [[Vladimir Lenin]] resided on Percy Circus, less than half a mile north of Clerkenwell Green. In 1903, the newspaper was moved to [[Geneva]]. It is said that Lenin and a young [[Joseph Stalin]] met in the Crown and Anchor pub (now The Crown Tavern)<ref name=crowntavernloc>{{NHLE|num=1195546 |desc=The Crown Tavern Public House |accessdate= 12 November 2016}} Has address 43 and 44, Clerkenwell Green</ref> when the latter was visiting London in 1903. In the 1920s and 1930s, 37a Clerkenwell Green was a venue for Communist Party meetings, and the [[Marx Memorial Library]] was founded on the same site in 1933. Clerkenwell's tradition of left-leaning publication continued until late 2008 with ''[[The Guardian]]'' and ''[[The Observer]]'' having their headquarters on Farringdon Road, a short walk from the Green. Their new offices are a short distance away in [[King's Cross, London|King's Cross]]. In 2011, an [[2011 anti-cuts protest in London|anti-cuts protest]] march departed from Clerkenwell and ended with a rally at [[Trafalgar Square]] demanding trade union rights, human rights and international solidarity.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-13254761 | work=BBC News | title=May Day: Thousands participate in rally | date=1 May 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Local government===\n[[File:Finsbury Met.

However, for civil matters they remained a single parish. The parish vestry became a nominating authority to the [[Metropolitan Board of Works]] in 1855.\n\nUnder the [[Metropolis Management Act 1855]] any parish that exceeded 2,000 [[Rates in the United Kingdom|ratepayers]] was to be divided into wards; as such the incorporated vestry of St James & St John Clerkenwell was divided into five wards (electing [[vestrymen]]): No. 1 (12), No. 2 (15), No. 3 (12), No. 4 (18) and No. 5 (15).<ref>{{cite book|title=The London Gazette Issue: 21802|date=20 October 1855|pages=3887\u20133888|url=https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/21802/page/3887|accessdate=8 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe area of the metropolitan board became the [[County of London]] in 1889. A reform of local government in 1900 abolished the Clerkenwell vestry and the parish became part of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Finsbury]]. [[Alexandra Park, London|Alexandra Park]], an exclave of the parish, was transferred to [[Hornsey]], Middlesex at the same time.<ref name=vision/> Clerkenwell Town Hall, which had been built on [[Rosebery Avenue]] in 1895, became [[Finsbury Town Hall]]. [[Finsbury]] became part of the [[London Borough of Islington]] in 1965 and the old town hall lay empty and deteriorating for many years. It has since been sold to the Urdang Dance Academy.\n\n===Post-war de-industrialisation and revival===\nAfter the [[Second World War]] Clerkenwell suffered from [[deindustrialization|industrial decline]] and many of the premises occupied by the engineering, printing publishing and meat and food trades (the last mostly around Smithfield) fell empty. Several acclaimed council housing estates were commissioned by [[Metropolitan Borough of Finsbury|Finsbury Borough Council]]. Modernist architect and [[Russia]]n \u00e9migr\u00e9 [[Berthold Lubetkin]]'s listed Spa Green Estate, constructed 1943\u20131950, has recently been restored. The [[Finsbury Estate]], constructed in 1968 to the designs of Joseph Emberton includes flats, since altered and re-clad.\n\nA general revival and gentrification process began in the 1980s, and the area is now known for loft-living in some of the former industrial buildings. It also has [[Yuppie|young professionals]], nightclubs and restaurants and is home to many professional offices as an overspill for the nearby [[City of London]] and [[West End of London|West End]]. Amongst other sectors, there is a notable concentration of design professions around Clerkenwell, and supporting industries such as high-end designer furniture showrooms. It is claimed that the area has the highest concentration of architects and building professionals in the world.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} Many of London's leading architectural practices have offices in the area.\n\n==Entertainment==\n\n===Public houses===\n[[File:Hope, Farringdon, EC1 (2486425799).jpg|thumb|[[The Hope, Smithfield|The Hope]]]]\nPubs that serve the Smithfield Market meat workers are allowed to open at 5.30&nbsp;am. These are [[Nicholson's Brewery]]'s former [[Art Nouveau]] [[gin palace]] the Fox & Anchor, [[The Hope, Smithfield|The Hope]], and the Cock Tavern (which is situated under the market itself).\n\nLondon's first [[gastropub]], the Eagle, opened in Clerkenwell in 1991. The Eagle has been joined by, among others, the Peasant, the Coach and Horses and the Gunmakers and the Green, which as part of a nationwide evolution of the traditional public house have since converted to gastropubs.\n\nIt is said that [[Vladimir Lenin]] and a young [[Joseph Stalin]] first met in the Crown and Anchor pub (now known as the Crown Tavern) on Clerkenwell Green, when the latter was visiting London in 1903.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.shadyoldlady.com/location.php?loc=2007 |publisher=The Shady Old Lady |title=Lenin met Stalin here |accessdate=31 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n''The Betsey Trotwood'' (named after [[Betsey Trotwood]] in ''[[David Copperfield]]'' by Charles Dickens) adopted the name in 1983, having previously been the ''Butcher's Arms''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thebetsey.com/home |title=Website of '&#39;The Betsey Trotwood'&#39; |publisher=Thebetsey.com |accessdate=2013-06-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130728170257/http://www.thebetsey.com/home |archive-date=28 July 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Restaurants===\nClerkenwell is home to some of the best restaurants in London,<ref>[https://archive.today/20120715164612/http://travel2.nytimes.com/2005/05/08/travel/08clerk.html?ex=1161057600&en=e9ba92ef4c9b30d7&ei=5070 ''New York Times'' article on Clerkenwell's history and restaurant scene]</ref> including [[St John (restaurant)|St John]] and the Michelin-starred [[Club Gascon]].\n\n===Bars===\nClerkenwell is the home of several bars including Smith's of Smithfield and The Slaughtered Lamb.

The community had mostly dispersed by the 1960s, but the area remains the 'spiritual home' of London's Italians, and is a focal point for more recent Italian immigrants, largely because of [[St Peter's Italian Church]].  There are officially over 200,000 Italians in London, and possibly many more.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/11149047/Young-Italians-abandon-la-dolce-vita-to-move-to-Britain.html|title=Young Italians abandon la dolce vita to move to Britain|first=Nick|last=Squires|date=8 October 2014|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref>  The Italian Procession of Our Lady of Mount Carmel and Sagra takes place each July in the streets surrounding the church.\n\nA small number of Italian businesses remain from the nineteenth century including organ builders Chiappa Ltd, and food outlets such as the [[Delicatessen|deli]] Terroni of Clerkenwell and Gazzano's.

Clouds of gas and dust would block the vision in many directions along the [[Milky Way]].\n\nSpace-based solar observatories such as [[Solar Dynamics Observatory|SDO]] and [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]] use ultraviolet telescopes (called [[Solar Dynamics Observatory#Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA)|AIA]] and [[Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Telescope|EIT]], respectively) to view activity on the Sun and its [[corona]]. Weather satellites such as the [[Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite|GOES-R]] series also carry [[GOES-16#Sun-facing|telescopes]] for observing the Sun in ultraviolet.\n\nThe [[Hubble Space Telescope]] and [[Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer|FUSE]] have been the most recent major [[space telescope]]s to view the near and far UV [[Electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]] of the sky, though other UV instruments have flown on smaller observatories such as [[GALEX]], as well as [[sounding rockets]] and the [[Space Shuttle]].\n\nPioneers in ultraviolet astronomy include [[George Robert Carruthers]], [[Robert Wilson (astronomer)|Robert Wilson]], and [[Charles Stuart Bowyer]].\n[[File:PIA20061 - Andromeda in High-Energy X-rays, Figure 1.jpg|thumb|center|500px|[[Andromeda Galaxy]] - in [[X-Ray astronomy|high-energy X-ray]] and ultraviolet light (released 5 January 2016).]]\n\n==Ultraviolet space telescopes==\n[[File:M101 UIT.gif|thumb|Astro 2 UIT captures [[Pinwheel Galaxy|M101]] with ultraviolet shown in purple]]\n*{{flagicon|United States}} - [[Far Ultraviolet Camera/Spectrograph]] on [[Apollo 16]] (April 1972)\n*{{flagicon|United States}} + [[ESRO]] - [[TD-1A]] (135-286&nbsp;nm; 1972\u20131974)\n*{{flagicon|United States}} - [[Orbiting Astronomical Observatory]] (#2:1968-73. #3:1972-1981)\n*{{flagicon|Soviet Union}} - [[Orion 1 and Orion 2 Space Observatories]] (#1: 200-380&nbsp;nm, 1971; #2: 200-300&nbsp;nm, 1973)\n*{{flagicon|United States}} + {{flagicon|Netherlands}} - [[Astronomical Netherlands Satellite]] (150-330&nbsp;nm, 1974\u20131976)\n*{{flagicon|United States}} + {{flagicon|European Union}} - [[International Ultraviolet Explorer]] (115-320&nbsp;nm, 1978\u20131996)\n*{{flagicon|Soviet Union}} - [[Astron (spacecraft)|Astron-1]] (150-350&nbsp;nm, 1983\u20131989)\n*{{flagicon|Soviet Union}} - Glazar 1 and 2 on [[Mir]] (in [[Kvant-1]], 1987-2001)\n*{{flagicon|United States}} - [[Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer|EUVE]] (7-76&nbsp;nm, 1992-2001)\n*{{flagicon|United States}} - [[Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer|FUSE]] (90.5-119.5&nbsp;nm, 1999-2007)\n*{{flagicon|United States}} + {{flagicon|European Union}} - [[Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Telescope]] (on [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]] imaging Sun at 17.1, 19.5, 28.4, and 30.4&nbsp;nm)\n*{{flagicon|United States}} + {{flagicon|European Union}} - [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (Hubble [[Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph|STIS]] 1997\u2013115\u20131030&nbsp;nm) (Hubble [[Wide Field Camera 3|WFC3]] 2009\u2013200-1700&nbsp;nm)\n*{{flagicon|United States}} - [[Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission]] (170\u2013650&nbsp;nm, 2004-- )\n*{{flagicon|United States}} - [[Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope]] (flew in 1990 and 1995)\n*{{flagicon|Germany}} - [[ROSAT]] XUV<ref>[http://iraf.noao.edu/iraf/ftp/iraf/conf/web/adass_proc/adass_95/staubertr/staubertr.html R.

[[Clapton railway station]], the area's only station, lies {{convert|4.7|mi}} north-east [[Charing Cross]].\n\n==Geography and origins==\nThe hamlet of Clapton emerged in the manor and [[Civil Parish#Ancient Parishes|Ancient Parish]] of [[Hackney, London|Hackney]]. \n\n===Origins===\nThe hamlet of Clapton was, from 1339 (when first recorded) until the 18th century normally rendered as Clopton, meaning the \"farm on the hill\". The Old English clop - \"lump\" or \"hill\" - presumably denoted the high ground which rises from the River Lea. Clapton grew up as a linear hamlet along the road subsequently known as Lower and Upper Clapton Road. As the area became urbanised, the extent of the area called Clapton eventually increased to encompass most of the north-eastern quarter of Hackney.\n\n===Scope===\nBecause Clapton has never been an administrative unit, it has never had any defined boundaries, though the E5 postcode area (established in 1917) has been influential in shaping perceptions of the area's extent, E5 occupies most of the north-east of Hackney. The district borders the [[River Lea]] (spelled Lea or Lee) to the east.\n\nDescribing Clapton as approximating to E5 is useful, but informal and imperfect - postcode areas are not intended to define districts. An example of the imperfection of using E5 is that part of the community around Clapton Common is excluded from the postal district despite almost always being publicly viewed as being part of Upper Clapton.\n\n===Administrative history===\nThe [[Hackney (parish)|Ancient Parish of Hackney]] split from [[Stepney#Manor and Ancient parish|Stepney]] in the Middle Ages and had consistent boundaries from that time on. The parish was part of a highly autonomous area of south-east [[Middlesex]] called the [[Tower division|Tower Hamlets (or Tower division)]] which exercised power that were normally held at county and [[hundred (county division)|hundred]] level.\n\nIn 1900 the [[Metropolitan Borough of Hackney]] was formed, using the boundaries of the former parish, and it became part of the [[County of London]]. In 1965 Hackney merged with the boroughs of [[Metropolitan Borough of Shoreditch|Shoreditch]] and [[Metropolitan Borough of Stoke Newington|Stoke Newington]] to form the modern [[London Borough of Hackney]], part of a new larger county of [[Greater London]]. \n\n===Upper and Lower Clapton===\nClapton was a linear hamlet covering an extended roadside area.\nFrom the early 19th century, manorial courts distinguished the parts north and south of Lea Bridge Road as Upper and Lower Clapton, and those names soon passed into general use with Hackney Lane becoming known as Lower and Upper Clapton roads. In the late 19th century the stretch of road through the Clapton Common to Stamford Hill was named Clapton Common.<ref>{{cite book|title='Hackney: Clapton', ''A History of the County of Middlesex''|volume=10|year=1995|pages=44\u201351|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22702|accessdate=2011-05-17}}</ref> \n\nThe junction with Lea Bridge Road is still used to define Upper and Lower Clapton; Kenninghall Road is an extension of Lea Bridge Road and as such also provides a convenient point of reference between the two parts of Clapton.\n\n==Latter History==\n===Brooke House===\n[[File:Upper Clapton Macaroni.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Maccaroni (fashion)|Maccaroni]]s were 18th-century dandies. This example 1792 is from [[Sutton House, London|Sutton House]]]]\nA large house known as the King's House stood on the site now occupied by [[BSix Sixth Form College]], as early 1476. The house was within a {{convert|200|acre|km2|2|sing=on}} estate, which was described as the Manor of Hackney from about 1532 to the early 17th century &mdash; although there were two other manors in the south of the Parish.<ref name=\"Brooke\">[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=100172 ''Documentary evidence''], ''[[Survey of London]]'': volume 28: Brooke House, Hackney (1960), pp. 52-66. Date accessed: 22 January 2009</ref>\n\nIn 1532, Henry Algernon Percy, [[Henry Percy, 6th Earl of Northumberland|Earl of Northumberland]], acquired the estate from Sir Richard Neville. However, in January 1535 the land was taken by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]; in settlement of a debt. The King visited the house in April 1535 and on 24 September 1535 he granted his \"manor or principal messuage of Hackney\" to [[Thomas Cromwell]], his chief minister. Cromwell refurbished the house, and on 1 May 1536, returned the house to the King. In July 1536, [[Ralph Sadleir]]<ref>Sadleir had been a member of Cromwell's household, and was appointed Henry's Secretary of State for Scotland</ref> brought [[Mary I of England]] to the house to swear the [[Oath of Supremacy]] before her father, and [[Jane Seymour]], the Queen. Henry continued to own the house until his death in January 1547.<ref name=\"Brooke\" /> [[Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford]], died in the house in Hackney known as the \"King's House\" on 24 June 1604.\n\nThe name of the house derives from its purchase by [[Fulke Greville, 1st Baron Brooke]], in 1621 &mdash; which led to ownership by the family for over 200 years. The house became tenanted after 1724, but in 1758&ndash;9 the house was modified by a leasee, William Clarke who converted it to a lunatic asylum. The site remained in this use until 1940.<ref name=\"Brooke\" />\n\nThe remains of the house were destroyed by [[airstrike|enemy action]] in October 1940. {{convert|5.5|acre|km2|2}} of Brooke House were purchased by the [[London County Council]] in 1944, and further bomb damage occurred that year. The house was finally demolished in 1954, and archaeological investigations of the Tudor palace took place in 1955&ndash;6. New school buildings were erected in 1960, designed by Armstrong and MacManus.<ref name=\"Brooke\" />\n\n===21st century===\nThe [[2011 England riots]] affected Clapton, with Clarence Road being the epicentre of the rioting in the district.

However, the church was originally built by the [[Agapemonite]] cult in 1892 as the Church of the Ark of the Covenant.\n\nThe Agapemonites, who held decidedly unconventional views on marriage and the role of women, relocated to Upper Clapton from their spiritual community in [[Spaxton]], [[Somerset]], and had clearly prospered by this time. Although it is fairly conventional in floor plan, the outside of the church is a riot of statuary and symbolism. The main doorways sport large carvings of angels and the four evangelists symbolised by a man, an eagle, a bull and a lion. The same four figures, cast in bronze, look out over the four quarters of the Earth from the base of the steeple. The two flanking weather vanes show a certain symbolic debt to [[William Blake]]'s Jerusalem depicting, as they do, a fiery chariot and a sheaf of arrows (presumably of desire), while the main steeple is clearly surmounted by a spear. The stained glass windows, designed by noted children's book illustrator [[Walter Crane]], and made by J S Sparrow,<ref>{{NHLE|num=1235310|desc=|accessdate=16 January 2012}}</ref> betray the unconventional nature of the sect as they illustrate the 'true station of womankind'.\n\nThe church, which was completed in 1895, was designed by [[Joseph Morris (architect)|Joseph Morris]] and his family, some of whom were members of the sect.<ref>{{cite web |title=(Former) Agapemonite Church of the Ark of the Covenant, Upper Clapton, London (Exterior) |url=http://www.victorianweb.org/art/architecture/churches/77.html |website=www.victorianweb.org |accessdate=16 January 2019}}</ref> The style is [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]]; for its \"curiosity value\" it was designated a [[listed building|Grade II-listed building]] on 12 September 1969.<ref>{{NHLE |num=1235310 |accessdate=22 January 2009}} </ref>\n\n[[File:Upper clapton good shepherd 2.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Good Shepherd's extravagant main entrance. (October 2005)]]\nThe cult had always been surrounded by scandal during its sojourn in Somerset and, after the move to Clapton, this degenerated into sheer farce. The original leader, [[Henry James Prince]], who claimed to be immortal, died in 1899 and was succeeded by the charming but philandering [[John Hugh Smyth-Pigott]], who wasted no time before [[List of messiah claimants|declaring himself as the Messiah]]. Challenged by a jeering mob to prove his godhood by walking across [[Clapton Pond]], Smyth-Pigott declined and retired to Somerset, where he was said to enjoy the favours of as many as seven \"spiritual brides\" a week. Smyth-Pigott, who also claimed immortality, died in 1927, after which the cult went into decline. The Clapton church had already been abandoned by the cult and was acquired first by the Ancient Catholic Church in 1956, and then by the [[Georgian Orthodox Church]] in 2005.<ref>[http://www.goclp.org.uk/eng/recent.html] The Georgian Orthodox Church, London Parish of Saint George</ref>\n\n===The New Synagogue===\n[[File:Upper clapton new synagogue 1.jpg|thumb|right|The New Synagogue.

In spite of its handsome [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]]-style exterior, this is actually post-[[Edwardian]], built in 1915. It is, however, a faithful replica of an earlier building, the Great St Helen's Synagogue in the [[City of London]], which was designed by John Davies in 1838. The current building contains a number of original fixtures from its predecessor. Endangered for a while, the synagogue was restored in 2005.{{fact|date=January 2019}}\n\n===Anchor and Hope pub===\n[[File:Upper clapton anchor and hope.jpg|thumb|left|The Anchor and Hope, a war survivor overshadowed by postwar High Hill Ferry Estate.

It is now quite overshadowed by pre- and post-war blocks of flats.\n\n===Urban Fabric===\nLarge parts of Lower Clapton look much as they did when the area was first developed in the second half of the 19th century. Most of the housing stock consists of [[Victorian architecture|Victorian terraces]] of various sizes.

In the late 19th century the stretch of road through the Clapton Common to Stamford Hill was named Clapton Common.<ref>{{cite book|title='Hackney: Clapton', ''A History of the County of Middlesex''|volume=10|year=1995|pages=44\u201351|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22702|accessdate=2011-05-17}}</ref> \n\nThe junction with Lea Bridge Road is still used to define Upper and Lower Clapton; Kenninghall Road is an extension of Lea Bridge Road and as such also provides a convenient point of reference between the two parts of Clapton.\n\n==Latter History==\n===Brooke House===\n[[File:Upper Clapton Macaroni.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Maccaroni (fashion)|Maccaroni]]s were 18th-century dandies.

The house was within a {{convert|200|acre|km2|2|sing=on}} estate, which was described as the Manor of Hackney from about 1532 to the early 17th century &mdash; although there were two other manors in the south of the Parish.<ref name=\"Brooke\">[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=100172 ''Documentary evidence''], ''[[Survey of London]]'': volume 28: Brooke House, Hackney (1960), pp. 52-66.

However, in January 1535 the land was taken by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]; in settlement of a debt. The King visited the house in April 1535 and on 24 September 1535 he granted his \"manor or principal messuage of Hackney\" to [[Thomas Cromwell]], his chief minister. Cromwell refurbished the house, and on 1 May 1536, returned the house to the King. In July 1536, [[Ralph Sadleir]]<ref>Sadleir had been a member of Cromwell's household, and was appointed Henry's Secretary of State for Scotland</ref> brought [[Mary I of England]] to the house to swear the [[Oath of Supremacy]] before her father, and [[Jane Seymour]], the Queen. Henry continued to own the house until his death in January 1547.<ref name=\"Brooke\" /> [[Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford]], died in the house in Hackney known as the \"King's House\" on 24 June 1604.\n\nThe name of the house derives from its purchase by [[Fulke Greville, 1st Baron Brooke]], in 1621 &mdash; which led to ownership by the family for over 200 years. The house became tenanted after 1724, but in 1758&ndash;9 the house was modified by a leasee, William Clarke who converted it to a lunatic asylum. The site remained in this use until 1940.<ref name=\"Brooke\" />\n\nThe remains of the house were destroyed by [[airstrike|enemy action]] in October 1940. {{convert|5.5|acre|km2|2}} of Brooke House were purchased by the [[London County Council]] in 1944, and further bomb damage occurred that year. The house was finally demolished in 1954, and archaeological investigations of the Tudor palace took place in 1955&ndash;6. New school buildings were erected in 1960, designed by Armstrong and MacManus.<ref name=\"Brooke\" />\n\n===21st century===\nThe [[2011 England riots]] affected Clapton, with Clarence Road being the epicentre of the rioting in the district.

However, the church was originally built by the [[Agapemonite]] cult in 1892 as the Church of the Ark of the Covenant.\n\nThe Agapemonites, who held decidedly unconventional views on marriage and the role of women, relocated to Upper Clapton from their spiritual community in [[Spaxton]], [[Somerset]], and had clearly prospered by this time. Although it is fairly conventional in floor plan, the outside of the church is a riot of statuary and symbolism. The main doorways sport large carvings of angels and the four evangelists symbolised by a man, an eagle, a bull and a lion. The same four figures, cast in bronze, look out over the four quarters of the Earth from the base of the steeple. The two flanking weather vanes show a certain symbolic debt to [[William Blake]]'s Jerusalem depicting, as they do, a fiery chariot and a sheaf of arrows (presumably of desire), while the main steeple is clearly surmounted by a spear. The stained glass windows, designed by noted children's book illustrator [[Walter Crane]], and made by J S Sparrow,<ref>{{NHLE|num=1235310|desc=|accessdate=16 January 2012}}</ref> betray the unconventional nature of the sect as they illustrate the 'true station of womankind'.\n\nThe church, which was completed in 1895, was designed by [[Joseph Morris (architect)|Joseph Morris]] and his family, some of whom were members of the sect.<ref>{{cite web |title=(Former) Agapemonite Church of the Ark of the Covenant, Upper Clapton, London (Exterior) |url=http://www.victorianweb.org/art/architecture/churches/77.html |website=www.victorianweb.org |accessdate=16 January 2019}}</ref> The style is [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]]; for its \"curiosity value\" it was designated a [[listed building|Grade II-listed building]] on 12 September 1969.<ref>{{NHLE |num=1235310 |accessdate=22 January 2009}} </ref>\n\n[[File:Upper clapton good shepherd 2.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Good Shepherd's extravagant main entrance.

Challenged by a jeering mob to prove his godhood by walking across [[Clapton Pond]], Smyth-Pigott declined and retired to Somerset, where he was said to enjoy the favours of as many as seven \"spiritual brides\" a week. Smyth-Pigott, who also claimed immortality, died in 1927, after which the cult went into decline. The Clapton church had already been abandoned by the cult and was acquired first by the Ancient Catholic Church in 1956, and then by the [[Georgian Orthodox Church]] in 2005.<ref>[http://www.goclp.org.uk/eng/recent.html] The Georgian Orthodox Church, London Parish of Saint George</ref>\n\n===The New Synagogue===\n[[File:Upper clapton new synagogue 1.jpg|thumb|right|The New Synagogue.

An [[Open Skies]] agreement between Karachi to Dubai was agreed upon in 1993, and 12 private airlines were allowed to operate domestically in Pakistan. Both steps came simultaneously and put great pressure on PIA's financial performance, though PIA launched six new routes to the Persian Gulf and CIS countries, along with a tourist 'Air Safari' scenic flight over the [[Karakoram Mountains]] in 1994. Non-stop flights from Lahore and Islamabad to JFK and Canada were launched, while PIA added Jakarta, [[Fujairah]], [[Baku]] and [[Al-Ain]] to its network in 1994. In addition, PIA became a client of three flight-reservation systems, namely: [[Sabre (computer system)|Sabre]], [[Galileo CRS|Galileo]] and [[Amadeus CRS|Amadeus]].\n\nA [[Tupolev Tu-154]] aircraft was also leased briefly in 1996 to cope with a surge in passenger traffic during summer 1996. Flights to Beirut were resumed the same year as well before being discontinued a few years later. In 1999, PIA leased five Boeing 747-300 aircraft from [[Cathay Pacific]] to replace its Boeing 747-200M fleet. The aircraft were painted with a new livery, a handwork Pashmina tail, on white body and large Pakistan titles on the front fuselage. The livery was adopted in the early 90s but due to some copyright issues, it was dropped. The Boeing 747-300s continued to bear the new livery, but with a plain green tail with PIA titles. The other aircraft in the fleet were repainted in early 1990s livery.\n\n==== 2000s ====\n{{Multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = vertical\n| image1 = Boeing 747-367, Pakistan International Airlines - PIA AN0367768.jpg\n| caption1 = PIA [[Boeing 747|Boeing 747-300]] on short final to [[Heathrow Airport|London Heathrow International Airport]], circa 2003.\n| image2 = Boeing 777-240(ER), Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) JP5656886.jpg\n| caption2 = PIA [[Boeing 777|Boeing 777-200ER]] taking off from [[Manchester Airport]], circa 2006.\n| width = \n}}\n\nThe [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|War in Afghanistan]] following the attacks on [[September 11 attacks|11 September 2001]] negatively impacted PIA's operations as Afghan airspace was closed.<ref name=\":10\" /> However, following restructuring of the airline under new management in April 2001, the airline again became profitable.<ref name=\":10\" /> Cost per employee dropped 24% between 2000-3, which lower engineering and maintenance costs lead to enhanced airline revenue.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nIn July 2002, PIA purchased six [[Boeing 747|Boeing 747-300]] aircraft from [[Cathay Pacific]], five of which were already on lease. The sixth one arrived shortly afterwards and was used mainly on its North American and European routes. In October 2002, after ten years without any new orders, the airline placed an order for eight [[Boeing 777]] aircraft. The order included all three variants of 777, i.e. three 777-200ER (Extended Range), two 777-200LR (Longer Range) and three 777-300ER versions. PIA was the launch customer that revived the Boeing 777-200LR project that, until then, only had three orders.\n\nBoeing delivered the first of three 777-200ER aircraft to PIA in January 2004, and PIA introduced a new livery for the 777-200ERs that was applied to most of its fleet. PIA also leased six more Airbus A310-300 aircraft directly from Airbus. On 3 November 2005, PIA placed an order to purchase seven [[ATR 42]]-500 aircraft to replace its ageing fleet of Fokker F27 Friendships. On 10 November 2005, PIA used the 777-200LR to fly the world's longest flight by a commercial airliner, flying over 21,000 kilometers on an eastbound flight from Hong Kong to London for 22 hours and 22 minutes<ref name=\":19\" /> - a record which still stands as of late 2019.<ref name=\":20\" /> On 6 December 2005, PIA acquired another new Boeing 777-200ER on a ten-year lease.  On 23 December 2006, PIA took delivery of its first [[Boeing 777]]-300ER. The remaining aircraft were delivered in January 2007.\n\nOn 25 February 2006, Boeing delivered its first 777-200LR to PIA. ATR delivered two of the seven ordered ATR 42s to PIA in May and December 2006 respectively, following which the airline ceased using military [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules]] for passenger services in northern areas of Pakistan. The military aircraft were being used after the [[PIA Flight 688]] accident.\n\nWith the induction of long-range 777 aircraft in its fleet, PIA started offering non-stop flights from [[Toronto]] to Karachi, Islamabad, and Lahore from 3 March 2006.

The livery was white at the front and beige at the rear separated by a dark green stripe. The tail was painted white with a new typeface PIA acronym written in dark green. The Pakistan title was added to the front fuselage in all raised letters and the engine cowlings were painted in beige. The PIA logo written in calligraphic Urdu was added just behind the cockpit. However, due to criticism, the design was modified before the first Boeing 777 was delivered. The tail logo was replaced by a flowing Pakistan flag on a beige background. The \"Pakistan\" titles were removed and the PIA acronym was enlarged and moved onto the fuselage. The English and Urdu PIA titles remained the same. The leased A310s and most of the PIA fleet also adopted this livery at a later date.\n\n[[File:Boeing 747-300 (PIA) (5299437361).jpg|thumb|A PIA Boeing 747-300 painted in a ''Frontier'' livery]]\nIn early 2006, the airline launched four new tail designs for its fleet. The tails represented the four provinces of Pakistan: [[Sindh]], [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]], [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Khyber Pakhtoonkhwa]] and [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]]. The tails promoted the cultures of the four provinces of Pakistan by applying motifs to the tails and adding a city name to the rear of the fuselage corresponding to the province. The \"Frontier\" tail represented the \"Phulkari\" (flowering) pattern, which reflected a tradition of embroidery generally done on shawls, shirts, and linen. The \"Punjab\" tail was loosely related to the tile decoration of the [[Wazir Khan Mosque]] in Lahore. The \"Balochistan\" tail showed the creativity seen in the local kilims, carpets, and rugs woven with wool, goat or camel hair and mixed yarn. The pattern was mostly bold geometric motifs in primary colours dominated by red. The \"Sindh\" tail was influenced by the Hala tile work with electric blue and white floral patterns. In 2009, management stopped the application of provincial tails, deeming them too costly.\n\nPIA launched its new livery in early April 2010. An Airbus A310, Boeing 777-200 and Boeing 747-300 were the first aircraft to wear the new look. The livery was unveiled at the PIA headquarters on a Boeing 777 model. The livery consisted of a green and gold strip running around the bottom of the fuselage and continuing right up until the tail cone. The forward/upper portion was white and at the rear, it was an off-white/beige colour. The bottom part of the tail blended into the upper fuselage as it too is white, with the rest of the tail painted with a large wavy Pakistan flag, which takes up the whole tail, in a dark green colour. At the front of the fuselage, 'PIA' was written in a billboard style in dark green and underneath 'Pakistan' was written in golden colour. Just behind the cockpit, there is a stylised Urdu PIA logo as well as on the engines.\n\nIn July 2014, on the delivery of the first A320 series aircraft, PIA introduced a \"crescent and star\" on the aircraft engines' cowlings in place of the Urdu PIA logo. In 2015, after the completion of sixty years service, the 1960s livery was applied to three of the Airbus A320s and on one Boeing 777-200ER.\n\n[[File:PIA Markhor Livery.png|thumb|In 2018, Pakistan's national animal Markhor was chosen to be introduced as the brand identity on aircraft tail, however later the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan]] took ''suo motu'' action and barred PIA from using the Markhor as brand identity, only one Airbus A320 was painted in the livery.]]\nIn April 2018, PIA formally launched a new brand identity and livery and added a portrait of the [[Markhor]] in a ceremony held at PIA Offices in Islamabad, presented by the then head of brand of PIA, having Pakistan's national animal represented on its aircraft, including a large one on the tail and two on the engines, describing the resilient nature of PIA Brand surviving under the onslaught of all the negativity associated with the brand. The symbol of animal was chosen for its universal recognition as the Urdu calligraphy logo of PIA could not be comprehended by non-Pakistani customers. In essence the idea was to make PIA a truly international brand based on the values of resilience, grace and fortitude, something which PIA had lost with increased focus on ethnic traffic. The tail had a forward leaping Markhor having long screw horns, which are the features of 'Kashmiri Markhor' endemic to Pakistan only. According to the initial plan, a euro-white style was chosen and existing green and golden strips were removed from the aircraft fuselage along with off-white/beige colour on the rear fuselage, but later a major rebranding was carried out. The font of the PIA logo was also changed and added to the fuselage. For the first time, legacy PIA colours (Pakistan green and mustard gold) were dropped and a blue texture was added in the \"PIA\" acronym expanding the colour palette for the brand. [[Urdu]] PIA logo colour was also changed from the yellow-green gradient texture. The airline's slogan was also changed to \"''We Fly at the Right Attitude''\" from \"Great People to Fly With\". The first aircraft with the redesigned livery was converted on 12 May 2018 and rolled out of Isphani Hanger by the method of decals to make a debut at the [[Islamabad International Airport|New Islamabad International Airport]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1399780|title=First plane to land at new Islamabad airport tomorrow|last=Asghar|first=Mohammad|date=6 April 2018|work=Dawn}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Asghar|first1=Mohammad|title=PIA planes get a facelift|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1400035|work=Dawn|date=7 April 2018}}</ref> The re-branding was halted on Suo Moto Notice taken by Supreme Court of Pakistan on fears of spending millions on the rebranding and not paying the salary of the staff on time. The [[Supreme Court of Pakistan]] ''suo motu'' notice barred PIA from using the Markhor logo as its brand identity. Supreme Court later gave orders to retain the flag on the tail and disposed off the case. However, with management change, the re-branding was abandoned altogether.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ch-aviation.com/portal/news/67193-pia-secures-limited-govt-funding-but-barred-from-rebranding|title=PIA secures limited gov't funding but barred from rebranding}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://dailytimes.com.pk/258919/pia-rebranding-aims-to-rectify-errors-build-global-image/|title=PIA rebranding aims to rectify errors, build global image \u2013 Daily Times|date=27 June 2018}}</ref> Currently, the airline is operating a hybrid livery which features a euro-white fuselage and gold Urdu logo in-front of the front exits and engine cowling while the flag tail, English PIA (and Pakistan International in gold) titles in dark green and Pakistan titles in dark green on the belly have been retained from the 2010 livery. The PIA corporate website was also added ahead of the aft exits. Currently, five Boeing 777s and three A320s are sporting this livery.\n\n=== Former fleet ===\n[[File:PIA Douglas DC-8 Gilliand.jpg|thumb|A PIA [[Douglas DC-8|Douglas DC-8-21]], leased in 1977-1978]]\n[[File:Airbus_A310-308,_Pakistan_International_Airlines_-_PIA_AN0562544.jpg|thumb|A PIA [[Airbus A310-300]] landed at [[Germany]], [[Frankfurt Airport]] on 25 April 2004.]]\n[[File:Airbus A321-231, Pakistan International Airlines - PIA (Inter Airlines) AN1157696.jpg|thumb|A PIA [[Airbus A321]] taking off from [[Islamabad Airport]] (2006)]]\n[[File:PIA Boeing 747-300 Asuspine-5.jpg|thumb|A PIA [[Boeing 747|Boeing 747-300]] taking off from the [[Multan International Airport]] for a [[Hajj]] flight on 28 October 2010.]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse;text-align:center; margin: 1em auto;\"\n|+ \n|-\n!style=\"background:#004F30; width:150px;\"  |<span style=\"color:#AB9214;\">Aircraft</span>\n!style=\"background:#004F30; width:150px;\"  |<span style=\"color:#AB9214;\">Total</span>\n!style=\"background:#004F30; width:150px;\"  |<span style=\"color:#AB9214;\">Introduced</span>\n!style=\"background:#004F30; width:150px;\"  |<span style=\"color:#AB9214;\">Retired</span>\n|-\n|[[Airbus A300B4-200]]\n|11\n|1980\n|2005\n|-\n|[[Airbus A310-300]]\n|12\n|1991\n|2016\n|-\n|[[Airbus A321-200]]\n|2\n|2006\n|2007\n|-\n|[[Airbus A330-300]]\n|3\n|2016\n|2017<ref name=\"SriLank\" />\n|-\n|[[Boeing 707-320C]]\n|13\n|1960\n|1998\n|-\n|[[Boeing 720B]]\n|9\n|1962\n|1986\n|-\n|[[Boeing 737 Classic|Boeing 737-300]]\n|8\n|1985\n|2014\n|-\n|[[Boeing 737 Classic|Boeing 737-400]]\n|2\n|2004\n|2005\n|-\n|[[Boeing 737 Next Generation|Boeing 737-800]]\n|4\n|2014\n|2015\n|-\n|[[Boeing 747-200B]]\n|6\n|1976\n|2005\n|-\n|[[Boeing 747|Boeing 747-200B Combi]]\n|2\n|1979\n|2011\n|-\n|[[Boeing 747-300]]\n|6\n|1999\n|2015\n|-\n|[[Convair CV-240 family|Convair CV-240]]\n|4\n|1955\n|1959\n|-\n|[[de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter]]\n|8\n|1970\n|2001\n|-\n|[[Douglas DC-3]]\n|15\n|1955\n|1967\n|-\n|[[Douglas DC-8|Douglas DC-8-21F]]\n|1\n|1977\n|1978\n|-\n|[[Douglas DC-8|Douglas DC-61CF]]\n|1\n|1977\n|1978\n|-\n|[[Fokker F27 Friendship|Fokker F27-200 Friendship]]\n|24\n|1961\n|2006\n|-\n|[[Fokker F27 Friendship|Fokker F27-400 Friendship]]\n|1\n|1961\n|2003\n|-\n|[[Fokker F27 Friendship|Fokker F27-600 Friendship]]\n|5\n|1966\n|1986\n|-\n|[[Hiller OH-23 Raven|Hiller UH-12E4]]\n|1\n|1963\n|1971\n|-\n|[[Hawker Siddeley Trident|Hawker Siddeley Trident 1E]]\n|4\n|1966\n|1970\n|-\n|[[Lockheed L-100 Hercules|Lockheed L-100-382B-4C Hercules]]\n|2\n|1966\n|1966\n|-\n|[[Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation|Lockheed L-1049C Super Constellation]]\n|3\n|1954\n|1969\n|-\n|[[Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation|Lockheed L-1049H Super Constellation]]\n|2\n|1958\n|1969\n|-\n|[[McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30]]\n|5\n|1974\n|1986\n|-\n|[[Mil Mi-8|Mil Mi-8 MTV-1]]\n|1\n|1995\n|1997\n|-\n|[[Sikorsky S-61|Sikorsky S-61N]]\n|4\n|1963\n|1967\n|- \n|[[Tupolev Tu-154]]\n|4\n|1996\n|1997\n|-\n|[[Vickers Viscount|Vickers Viscount 815]]\n|5\n|1956\n|1966\n|}\n{{clear}}\n\n== Services ==\n=== Cabin ===\nPIA operates a three-class configuration on its domestic routes: [[Business class|Business]], [[Premium Economy|Executive Economy]] and [[Economy class|Economy]].

PIA Cargo transports goods across Pakistan as well as to international destinations. These include meat and vegetables, textiles, paper products, laboratory equipment and postal mail.\n\nDuring the early 1970s, PIA operated a service called \"Air Express\" that delivered documents and parcels within Pakistan. In 1974, PIA launched a dedicated cargo division within its organisation using two [[Boeing 707]]-320C. This division was known as \"Pakistan International Cargo\". The airline operated several cargo flights to the Middle East such as Dubai and Europe especially London. The operations ended in the late 1990s when both aircraft were phased out. During 2004 to 2007, the airline did again operate two Airbus A300 Freighter aircraft chartered through [[MNG Airlines]] to [[Haan]]. [[Luton]], Amsterdam, Basel and Cologne.

In the following years, [[PIA Planetarium, Karachi|PIA Planetarium]] was inaugurated in Karachi which was followed by planetariums in [[PIA Planetarium, Lahore|Lahore]] and [[PIA Planetarium, Peshawar|Peshawar]]. These planetariums featured retired PIA aircraft on display for educational or observational purposes.

In June 1991, PIA took delivery of its first of six [[Airbus A310|Airbus A310-300]] aircraft - with the new aircraft, the airline introduced flights to [[Tashkent]] in 1992 and to Z\u00fcrich in 1993.\n\nIn March 1993, AVM Farooq Umar became managing director of the airline. An [[Open Skies]] agreement between Karachi to Dubai was agreed upon in 1993, and 12 private airlines were allowed to operate domestically in Pakistan. Both steps came simultaneously and put great pressure on PIA's financial performance, though PIA launched six new routes to the Persian Gulf and CIS countries, along with a tourist 'Air Safari' scenic flight over the [[Karakoram Mountains]] in 1994. Non-stop flights from Lahore and Islamabad to JFK and Canada were launched, while PIA added Jakarta, [[Fujairah]], [[Baku]] and [[Al-Ain]] to its network in 1994. In addition, PIA became a client of three flight-reservation systems, namely: [[Sabre (computer system)|Sabre]], [[Galileo CRS|Galileo]] and [[Amadeus CRS|Amadeus]].\n\nA [[Tupolev Tu-154]] aircraft was also leased briefly in 1996 to cope with a surge in passenger traffic during summer 1996. Flights to Beirut were resumed the same year as well before being discontinued a few years later. In 1999, PIA leased five Boeing 747-300 aircraft from [[Cathay Pacific]] to replace its Boeing 747-200M fleet. The aircraft were painted with a new livery, a handwork Pashmina tail, on white body and large Pakistan titles on the front fuselage. The livery was adopted in the early 90s but due to some copyright issues, it was dropped. The Boeing 747-300s continued to bear the new livery, but with a plain green tail with PIA titles. The other aircraft in the fleet were repainted in early 1990s livery.\n\n==== 2000s ====\n{{Multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = vertical\n| image1 = Boeing 747-367, Pakistan International Airlines - PIA AN0367768.jpg\n| caption1 = PIA [[Boeing 747|Boeing 747-300]] on short final to [[Heathrow Airport|London Heathrow International Airport]], circa 2003.\n| image2 = Boeing 777-240(ER), Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) JP5656886.jpg\n| caption2 = PIA [[Boeing 777|Boeing 777-200ER]] taking off from [[Manchester Airport]], circa 2006.\n| width = \n}}\n\nThe [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|War in Afghanistan]] following the attacks on [[September 11 attacks|11 September 2001]] negatively impacted PIA's operations as Afghan airspace was closed.<ref name=\":10\" /> However, following restructuring of the airline under new management in April 2001, the airline again became profitable.<ref name=\":10\" /> Cost per employee dropped 24% between 2000-3, which lower engineering and maintenance costs lead to enhanced airline revenue.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nIn July 2002, PIA purchased six [[Boeing 747|Boeing 747-300]] aircraft from [[Cathay Pacific]], five of which were already on lease. The sixth one arrived shortly afterwards and was used mainly on its North American and European routes. In October 2002, after ten years without any new orders, the airline placed an order for eight [[Boeing 777]] aircraft. The order included all three variants of 777, i.e. three 777-200ER (Extended Range), two 777-200LR (Longer Range) and three 777-300ER versions. PIA was the launch customer that revived the Boeing 777-200LR project that, until then, only had three orders.\n\nBoeing delivered the first of three 777-200ER aircraft to PIA in January 2004, and PIA introduced a new livery for the 777-200ERs that was applied to most of its fleet. PIA also leased six more Airbus A310-300 aircraft directly from Airbus. On 3 November 2005, PIA placed an order to purchase seven [[ATR 42]]-500 aircraft to replace its ageing fleet of Fokker F27 Friendships. On 10 November 2005, PIA used the 777-200LR to fly the world's longest flight by a commercial airliner, flying over 21,000 kilometers on an eastbound flight from Hong Kong to London for 22 hours and 22 minutes<ref name=\":19\" /> - a record which still stands as of late 2019.<ref name=\":20\" /> On 6 December 2005, PIA acquired another new Boeing 777-200ER on a ten-year lease.  On 23 December 2006, PIA took delivery of its first [[Boeing 777]]-300ER. The remaining aircraft were delivered in January 2007.\n\nOn 25 February 2006, Boeing delivered its first 777-200LR to PIA. ATR delivered two of the seven ordered ATR 42s to PIA in May and December 2006 respectively, following which the airline ceased using military [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules]] for passenger services in northern areas of Pakistan. The military aircraft were being used after the [[PIA Flight 688]] accident.\n\nWith the induction of long-range 777 aircraft in its fleet, PIA started offering non-stop flights from [[Toronto]] to Karachi, Islamabad, and Lahore from 3 March 2006. PIA had also planned non-stop flights to New York City, Chicago, [[Washington D.C.|Washington]], and [[Houston]] but was not permitted by US authorities (unless the airline implemented a European stopover on the flight to American cities) due to security concerns after 9/11.\n\nA PIA flight from Multan crashed in July 2006, killing 45.

The livery was white at the front and beige at the rear separated by a dark green stripe. The tail was painted white with a new typeface PIA acronym written in dark green. The Pakistan title was added to the front fuselage in all raised letters and the engine cowlings were painted in beige. The PIA logo written in calligraphic Urdu was added just behind the cockpit. However, due to criticism, the design was modified before the first Boeing 777 was delivered. The tail logo was replaced by a flowing Pakistan flag on a beige background. The \"Pakistan\" titles were removed and the PIA acronym was enlarged and moved onto the fuselage. The English and Urdu PIA titles remained the same. The leased A310s and most of the PIA fleet also adopted this livery at a later date.\n\n[[File:Boeing 747-300 (PIA) (5299437361).jpg|thumb|A PIA Boeing 747-300 painted in a ''Frontier'' livery]]\nIn early 2006, the airline launched four new tail designs for its fleet. The tails represented the four provinces of Pakistan: [[Sindh]], [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]], [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Khyber Pakhtoonkhwa]] and [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]]. The tails promoted the cultures of the four provinces of Pakistan by applying motifs to the tails and adding a city name to the rear of the fuselage corresponding to the province. The \"Frontier\" tail represented the \"Phulkari\" (flowering) pattern, which reflected a tradition of embroidery generally done on shawls, shirts, and linen. The \"Punjab\" tail was loosely related to the tile decoration of the [[Wazir Khan Mosque]] in Lahore. The \"Balochistan\" tail showed the creativity seen in the local kilims, carpets, and rugs woven with wool, goat or camel hair and mixed yarn. The pattern was mostly bold geometric motifs in primary colours dominated by red. The \"Sindh\" tail was influenced by the Hala tile work with electric blue and white floral patterns. In 2009, management stopped the application of provincial tails, deeming them too costly.\n\nPIA launched its new livery in early April 2010. An Airbus A310, Boeing 777-200 and Boeing 747-300 were the first aircraft to wear the new look. The livery was unveiled at the PIA headquarters on a Boeing 777 model. The livery consisted of a green and gold strip running around the bottom of the fuselage and continuing right up until the tail cone. The forward/upper portion was white and at the rear, it was an off-white/beige colour. The bottom part of the tail blended into the upper fuselage as it too is white, with the rest of the tail painted with a large wavy Pakistan flag, which takes up the whole tail, in a dark green colour. At the front of the fuselage, 'PIA' was written in a billboard style in dark green and underneath 'Pakistan' was written in golden colour. Just behind the cockpit, there is a stylised Urdu PIA logo as well as on the engines.\n\nIn July 2014, on the delivery of the first A320 series aircraft, PIA introduced a \"crescent and star\" on the aircraft engines' cowlings in place of the Urdu PIA logo. In 2015, after the completion of sixty years service, the 1960s livery was applied to three of the Airbus A320s and on one Boeing 777-200ER.\n\n[[File:PIA Markhor Livery.png|thumb|In 2018, Pakistan's national animal Markhor was chosen to be introduced as the brand identity on aircraft tail, however later the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan]] took ''suo motu'' action and barred PIA from using the Markhor as brand identity, only one Airbus A320 was painted in the livery.]]\nIn April 2018, PIA formally launched a new brand identity and livery and added a portrait of the [[Markhor]] in a ceremony held at PIA Offices in Islamabad, presented by the then head of brand of PIA, having Pakistan's national animal represented on its aircraft, including a large one on the tail and two on the engines, describing the resilient nature of PIA Brand surviving under the onslaught of all the negativity associated with the brand. The symbol of animal was chosen for its universal recognition as the Urdu calligraphy logo of PIA could not be comprehended by non-Pakistani customers. In essence the idea was to make PIA a truly international brand based on the values of resilience, grace and fortitude, something which PIA had lost with increased focus on ethnic traffic. The tail had a forward leaping Markhor having long screw horns, which are the features of 'Kashmiri Markhor' endemic to Pakistan only. According to the initial plan, a euro-white style was chosen and existing green and golden strips were removed from the aircraft fuselage along with off-white/beige colour on the rear fuselage, but later a major rebranding was carried out. The font of the PIA logo was also changed and added to the fuselage. For the first time, legacy PIA colours (Pakistan green and mustard gold) were dropped and a blue texture was added in the \"PIA\" acronym expanding the colour palette for the brand. [[Urdu]] PIA logo colour was also changed from the yellow-green gradient texture. The airline's slogan was also changed to \"''We Fly at the Right Attitude''\" from \"Great People to Fly With\". The first aircraft with the redesigned livery was converted on 12 May 2018 and rolled out of Isphani Hanger by the method of decals to make a debut at the [[Islamabad International Airport|New Islamabad International Airport]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1399780|title=First plane to land at new Islamabad airport tomorrow|last=Asghar|first=Mohammad|date=6 April 2018|work=Dawn}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Asghar|first1=Mohammad|title=PIA planes get a facelift|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1400035|work=Dawn|date=7 April 2018}}</ref> The re-branding was halted on Suo Moto Notice taken by Supreme Court of Pakistan on fears of spending millions on the rebranding and not paying the salary of the staff on time. The [[Supreme Court of Pakistan]] ''suo motu'' notice barred PIA from using the Markhor logo as its brand identity. Supreme Court later gave orders to retain the flag on the tail and disposed off the case.

It is commonly constructed of a thin membrane or sheet of various materials, suspended at its edges.  The varying air pressure of sound waves imparts mechanical vibrations to the diaphragm which can then be converted to some other type of signal; examples of this type of diaphragm are found in [[microphone]]s and the human [[eardrum]].  Conversely a diaphragm vibrated by a source of energy beats against the air, creating sound waves.  Examples of this type of diaphragm are [[loudspeaker]] cones and [[earphone]] diaphragms and are found in [[air horn]]s.\n\n==Loudspeaker==\nIn a dynamic [[loudspeaker]], a diaphragm is the thin, semi-rigid [[Acoustic membrane|membrane]] attached to the [[voice coil]], which moves in a magnetic gap, vibrating the diaphragm, and producing [[sound]]. It can also be called a '''cone''', though not all speaker diaphragms are cone-shaped.  Diaphragms are also found in [[headphones]].\n\nQuality midrange and bass drivers are usually made from paper, paper composites and laminates, plastic materials such as [[polypropylene]], or mineral/fiber filled polypropylene.  Such materials have very high strength/weight ratios (paper being even higher than metals) and tend to be relatively immune from flexing during large excursions.  This allows the driver to react quickly during transitions in music (i.e. fast changing transient impulses) and minimizes acoustical output distortion.\n\nIf properly designed in terms of mass, stiffness, and damping, paper woofer/midrange cones can outperform many exotic drivers made from more expensive materials.

The ability of paper (cellulose) to be easily modified by chemical or mechanical means gives it a practical processing advantage not found in other common cone materials.\n\nThe purpose of the cone/surround assembly is to accurately reproduce the voice coil signal waveform.  Inaccurate reproduction of the voice coil signal results in acoustical distortion.  The ideal for a cone/surround assembly is an extended range of linearity or \"pistonic\" motion characterized by i) minimal acoustical breakup of the cone material, ii) minimal standing wave patterns in the cone, and iii) linearity of the surrounds force-deflection curve.

An ideal surround has a linear force-deflection curve with sufficient damping to fully absorb vibrational transmissions from the cone/surround interface, and the \"toughness\" to withstand long-term vibration-induced fatigue.

The school's team competes in [[NCAA Division I]] as part of the [[American Athletic Conference]]. The Bearcats are coached by [[John Brannen (basketball)|John Brannen]], who has been UC's head coach since 2019.\n\nWith over 1800 all-time wins, the Bearcats are one of the 15 winningest basketball programs of all-time. The school's merits include 2 National Titles, 6 Final Fours, and 33 [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]] appearances. As of 2019, Cincinnati has appeared in 9 consecutive NCAA Tournaments, and 23 of the last 28, with an all-time tournament record of 46\u201332. There have also been 42 All-American honors issued to Bearcats as well, while 34 have gone on to play in the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] (4 were active as of the 2018-19 NBA season).\n\nCincinnati has been playing its home games since 1989 at [[Fifth Third Arena]], which received an $87 million renovation for the 2018 season. The Bearcats played their 2017\u201318 season at [[BB&T Arena]] on the campus of [[Northern Kentucky University]] in [[Highland Heights, Kentucky]] while their home arena was renovated. Cincinnati joined the [[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|original Big East Conference]] in 2005, which was rebranded as the [[American Athletic Conference]] (AAC) in 2013.\n\n==By the numbers==\nStatistics and NCAA all-time rankings (through the end of the 2017\u201318 season):\n* Wins: 1835 (14th)<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/schools/cincinnati/|title=Cincinnati|website=College Basketball at Sports-Reference.com|access-date=2020-03-09}}</ref>\n* Win percentage: .641 (23th)<ref name=\":0\" />\n* National Titles: 2 (T-9th)<ref>[[List of NCAA Men's Division I Basketball champions]]</ref>\n* Final Fours: 6 (T-10th)<ref>[[NCAA Men's Division I Final Four appearances by school]]</ref>\n* NCAA Tournament appearances: 33 (T-13th)<ref>[[NCAA Men's Division I Tournament bids by school]]</ref>\n* NCAA Tournament games played: 77 (16th)<ref name=\"NCAA Tournament wins\"/>\n* NCAA Tournament wins: 46 (17th)<ref name=\"NCAA Tournament wins\">[[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament all-time team records]]</ref>\n* Weeks in the AP Top 25: 434 (12th)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collegepollarchive.com/mbasketball/ap/app_total.cfm?sort=totapp&from=1949&to=2018|title=Total AP Men's BB Poll Appearances Summary \u2013 College Poll Archive \u2013 Historical College Football and Basketball Polls and Rankings|author=|date=|work=collegepollarchive.com|accessdate=April 20, 2017}}</ref>\n* Weeks in the AP Top 10: 210 (15th)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collegepollarchive.com/mbasketball/ap/app_total.cfm?sort=top10app&from=1949&to=2018|title=Total AP Men's BB Poll Appearances Summary \u2013 College Poll Archive \u2013 Historical College Football and Basketball Polls and Rankings|author=|date=|work=collegepollarchive.com|accessdate=April 20, 2017}}</ref>\n* Weeks at No. 1 in the AP Poll: 45 (7th)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collegepollarchive.com/mbasketball/ap/app_total.cfm?sort=num1app&from=1949&to=2018|title=Total AP Men's BB Poll Appearances Summary \u2013 College Poll Archive \u2013 Historical College Football and Basketball Polls and Rankings|author=|date=|work=collegepollarchive.com|accessdate=April 20, 2017}}</ref>\n* 14 consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances from 1992\u20132005 (T-11th longest streak all-time)<ref>[[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament consecutive appearances]]</ref>\n* 10 consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances from 2011\u2013present (T-5th longest active streak)<ref>[[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament consecutive appearances]]</ref>\n* First-team Consensus All-American selections: 8 (T-22nd)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/m_basketball_RB/2012/Awards.pdf|title=All-American Award Winners|author=|date=|work=ncaa.org|accessdate=April 20, 2017}}</ref>\n* Current players in the NBA: 2 (T-26th)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/article/2018-10-16/colleges-most-players-nba-opening-day-rosters|title=Where the NBA Players Come From|first=Jim|last=Sukup|date=|work=ncaa.com|accessdate=October 16, 2018}}</ref>\n* First school to reach three consecutive National Title games (1961\u201363)<ref name=\"UC Basketball history\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gobearcats.com/datadump/sports/mbball/history/history.html|title=UCBearcats \u2013 Official Athletic Website of the University of Cincinnati|author=|date=|work=gobearcats.com|accessdate=April 20, 2017}}</ref>\n* First school to reach five consecutive Final Fours (1959\u201363)<ref name=\"UC Basketball history\"/>\n\n==History==\n\n===1901-1940s \u2013 The beginning===\nBasketball formally debuted as a selected varsity team in 1901 and played nine games. Cincinnati, in its first season lost to [[Yale]] but later defeated a team from the [[University of Kentucky]] while compiling a 5\u20134 record, with the remaining games being against non-collegiate teams. Home games during this time were played in a gym in the basement of McMicken Hall. Pillars on the court gave UC a home court advantage. UC experienced moderate success in the early days, with the main highlights being them winning several conference championships in both the [[Buckeye Athletic Association]] and the [[Mid-American Conference]].\n\n===1954\u20131958 \u2013 The start of something special===\nCincinnati opened its new on-campus arena, [[Armory Fieldhouse]], with a 97\u201365 win over [[Indiana]] in 1954. One of the first of Cincinnati's long list of standouts was [[Jack Twyman]], who earned [[All-America]] status in 1954\u201355. He went on to NBA stardom and is in the [[Basketball Hall of Fame]].\n[[Oscar Robertson]] made his debut in 1957, and quickly emerged as one of the top college players in the country. \"The Big O\" is still widely recognized as one of the greatest to ever play the sport\u2014college or professional. A unanimous three-time All-American, he was college basketball's all-time leading scorer at the close of his career. His 33.8 scoring average today ranks third on the NCAA career charts, and he has the NBA's third-most career assists. The Bearcats celebrated their entry into the [[Missouri Valley Conference]] by winning the league title. Cincinnati made its first NCAA tournament appearance in 1958, losing to [[Kansas State]] in overtime at the Midwest Regional.\n\n===1958\u20131964 \u2013 A run unlike any other===\nSparked by the exploits of Robertson, who became the first player to lead the nation in scoring in three consecutive seasons, Cincinnati advanced to the Final Four in 1958\u201359 and 1959\u201360, settling for third place both years. Then the Bearcats, with a rookie head coach ([[Ed Jucker]]) and without Robertson, won their first national title in 1960\u201361. Then to prove that its 1961 championship was no fluke, UC repeated as national champion in 1961\u201362. Cincinnati made a fifth-straight trip to the Final Four in 1962\u201363, and narrowly missed capturing a third-straight national crown when Loyola (Ill.) overcame a 15-point deficit and defeated the Bearcats by a basket, 60\u201358, in overtime.\n\nDuring those five seasons, UC recorded a 37-game win streak and posted a 161\u201316 ledger. The five straight Final Four appearances is a feat topped only by UCLA. [[Connie Dierking]] (1958), [[Ralph Davis (basketball)|Ralph Davis]] (1960), [[Bob Wiesenhahn]] (1961), [[Paul Hogue]] (1961, 1962), [[Tom Thacker (basketball)|Tom Thacker]] (1963), [[Tony Yates]] (1963), [[Ron Bonham]] (1963, 1964) and [[George Wilson (basketball, born 1942)|George Wilson]] (1963) were accorded All-American recognition with Wilson playing on the U.S. 1964 Olympic gold medal team.\n\n===1970s \u2013 Continued success===\nThe Bearcats during the 1970s compiled a 170\u201385 record (.667). Cincinnati inaugurated the [[Metro Conference]] by winning the league's first two tournament championships and made four consecutive post-season appearances from 1974\u20131977, including a Sweet Sixteen appearance in 1975. [[Jim Ard]] (1970), [[Lloyd Batts]] (1973), [[Steve Collier]] (1976), [[Gary Yoder]] (1977), [[Bob Miller (basketball)|Bob Miller]] (1978) and [[Pat Cummings]] (1979) earned All-American recognition. Cummings closed his career as UC's No. 2 leading scorer of all-time.\n\n===1980\u20131988 \u2013 Down in the dumps===\nCincinnati fell into exceptionally hard times during the 1980s, going 112\u2013142 over the course of the decade. [[Tony Yates]], a member of the national championship teams in the 1960s, was hired as head coach in 1983. In his first season in 1983\u201384, UC went 3\u201325 (0\u201314 in conference), the school's worst season (winning-percentage-wise) since going 1\u20139 in 1915. After several unremarkable campaigns thereafter, Yates was fired after the 1989 season. The Bearcats of the 1980s failed to make a single NCAA tournament, and only had one postseason appearance in the 1985 [[1985 National Invitation Tournament|NIT]].\n\n===1989\u20132005 \u2013 Back into the national spotlight===\n[[Bob Huggins]], the former head coach at the University of Akron, was named head coach at UC prior to the 1989\u201390 season. Taking over a team with a proud history but one that had not had any legitimate success in over a decade, Huggins quickly turned things around and rekindled the national championship expectations of the past. Posting winning records in each of his first two seasons, Huggins would soon prove that his team was for real and in only his third season at the helm he directed UC to the 1992 Final Four. The 1992 team that went on to lose to Michigan's \"Fab Five\" in the Final Four, would set a high standard of success that would last for years to come. The Bearcats advanced to the Elite Eight of the NCAA tournament three times, and reached the Sweet 16 four times while Huggins was coach. Cincinnati also won its conference season and/or tournament title in 12 years out of a 13-year span (1992\u20132004). UC was also one of the top ranked teams of this time, often being ranked in the top 10 if not number one in the country. Huggin's team merits include claiming eight league tournament titles and 10 regular season crowns in addition to appearing in 14 consecutive NCAA Tournaments (1992\u20132005).\n\nFifteen Bearcats had garnered first team all-conference honors during this era with three of those, [[Danny Fortson]], [[Kenyon Martin]] and [[Steve Logan]], picking up a total of four C-USA Most Outstanding Player Awards. Fortson, [[Nick Van Exel]], [[Ruben Patterson]], Bobby Brannen, [[Melvin Levett]], Logan, Martin and Pete Mickeal have joined Cincinnati's list of All-Americans. Fortson was a consensus first team All-American in 1996\u201397 after receiving second team recognition in 1995\u201396. Martin was college basketball's top player of the 1999\u20132000 season, making a clean sweep of the national player of the year awards. Logan was a consensus All-American in 2001\u201302 and a finalist for every national player of the year award. Several Bearcats were NBA Draft Picks, including Martin being the number one overall pick in 2000.\n\nHuggins was forced to resign by school president [[Nancy Zimpher]] in August 2005. Zimpher was angered by the lackluster academic performance of Huggins' teams (he routinely only graduated 30 percent of his players), and felt that Huggins didn't fit in with her plan to upgrade UC's academic reputation. Huggins hadn't helped his standing with Zimpher when he was arrested for [[driving under the influence|DUI]] in 2004.<ref name=\"WSJ\">{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB114367599328911693?mod=todays_us_personal_journal | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Skip | last=Rozin | title=The Basketball Coach Vs. the College President | date=March 30, 2006}}</ref><ref name=\"wlwt.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wlwt.com/sports/4885953/detail.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201172318/http://www.wlwt.com/sports/4885953/detail.html |archivedate=2008-12-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/news/story?id=2141189|title=Text of letter sent to Cincinnati coach Bob Huggins|date=23 August 2005|website=ESPN.com}}</ref>  This decision was met wide widespread criticism among virtually everyone connected to the program, creating a situation that would not bode well for the team in the near future. Looking to stay within the program, the school immediately promoted assistant coach [[Andy Kennedy (basketball coach)|Andy Kennedy]] as interim head coach for the 2005\u201306 season.\n\n===2006\u20132009 \u2013 Resurrecting a gutted program===\nIn the spring of 2006, [[Mick Cronin (basketball)|Mick Cronin]] was hired as head coach, replacing interim coach [[Andy Kennedy (basketball coach)|Andy Kennedy]] after the dismissal of [[Bob Huggins]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/news/story?id=2382844|title=Cronin introduced as head coach at Cincinnati|author=|date=March 24, 2006|work=espn.com|accessdate=April 20, 2017}}</ref> Cronin was tasked with picking up the pieces from a depleted program after Huggins was abruptly asked to resign three months before the 2005 season, and a temporary coach in Kennedy for the previous season. Due to the school having little-to-no recruiting going on for around a full calendar year, Cronin was forced to scrounge for players. He even had a couple players on the school's football team play, one being future NFL linebacker [[Connor Barwin]].\n\nAlthough Cronin's teams struggled early in his UC career, he improved the school's win total each of his first five seasons. After two straight losing seasons, UC began to get back on track under Cronin in the 2008\u201309 season with an 18\u201314 record. This was then followed by an NIT appearance and a brief return to the Top 25 polls during the 2009\u201310 campaign.\n\n===2010\u2013present \u2013 Return to winning ways===\nDespite the surroundings, Cincinnati began the retooling process, becoming the only program from a major conference to improve its win total every season from 2007 to 2011, building from 11 wins in 2007 to 26 victories and a return to the NCAA Tournament in 2011.\nNow a fixture at the Big Dance, Cincinnati can include itself among an elite list of six programs appearing in eight [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament consecutive appearances|consecutive NCAA Tournaments]], along with [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]], [[Gonzaga Bulldogs men's basketball|Gonzaga]], [[Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball|Kansas]], [[Michigan State Spartans men's basketball|Michigan State]] and [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina]]. This run of 9 consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances by Cincinnati would see UC advance to the Round of 32 five times and to the Sweet 16 once as of the 2018\u201319 season.\n\nDuring the 2014\u201315 season, Mick Cronin discovered he had an arterial dissection and sat out the rest of the season, last coaching December 17th against [[San Diego State Aztecs men's basketball|San Diego State]].<ref>https://www.si.com/college-basketball/2015/01/05/cincinnati-mick-cronin-health</ref> Assistant Coach, [[Larry Davis (basketball)|Larry Davis]] took the reigns and lead the team onto a respectable season and classic overtime victory over [[Purdue Boilermakers men's basketball|Purdue]] in the first round of the NCAA Tournament.\n\nIn 2013\u201314 season and 2017\u201318 season Cincinnati were American Athletic Conference regular season champions and in 2017\u201318 and 2018\u20132019 seasons Cincinnati won the [[American Athletic Conference Men's Basketball Tournament]]. During this time many notable players came to Cincinnati with several progressing to the NBA, such as [[Sean Kilpatrick]], [[Troy Caupain]], [[Jacob Evans]], and [[Gary Clark (basketball)|Gary Clark]]. The Bearcats also featured consecutive AAC Player-of-the-Year (POY) winners in Gary Clark and [[Jarron Cumberland]].\n\nOn April 9, 2019, it was announced that Mick Cronin would be leaving Cincinnati to become the next head coach of the [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA Bruins]] after UCLA had fired Coach [[Steve Alford]] earlier in the season (ironically, his firing was due in part to a blowout loss to the [[2018\u201319 Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball team|Bearcats]]). On April 14, 2019, it was announced that [[John Brannen (basketball)| John Brannen]] was being hired as the new head coach.\n\n==Notable seasons==\n* '''1959\u201360''' [[Oscar Robertson]] scored a school record 62 points in an early-February game vs. [[North Texas State]] and in the process became the NCAA's all-time leading career scorer. Robertson claimed national player of the year honors for the third straight year while Cincinnati won its third straight [[Missouri Valley Conference|Missouri Valley]] title. The Bearcats made their second trip to the Final Four. [[California]] again turned back UC's title hopes as UC finished third. George Smith stepped down as head coach to become athletic director, capping a career in which he posted a 154\u201356 record in eight years.\n* '''1960\u201361''' Largely an unknown team, without Robertson, and with a new head coach, [[Ed Jucker]], in command, Cincinnati stumbled to a 5\u20133 start. The Bearcats then won their next 22 contests, garnering a league title, a third straight trip to the Final Four, and a national championship. In the first-ever championship game matchup of two teams from the same state, UC defeated [[Ohio State]] in overtime, 70\u201365.\n* '''1961\u201362''' Cincinnati fashioned a 28\u20132 record, but the Bearcats had to defeat [[Bradley]] in a league playoff game to defend their national title. UC won the Midwest Regional to earn its fourth straight trip to the Final Four. After edging [[UCLA]], 72\u201370, in the semifinals, Cincinnati became a repeat champion with a 71\u201359 win over Ohio State. [[Paul Hogue]] was the tournament's Most Outstanding Player.\n* '''1962\u201363''' UC breezed to its fifth straight [[Missouri Valley Conference]] crown and, after winning the Midwest Regional, a fifth straight trip to the Final Four. An 80\u201346 win over [[Oregon]] in the semifinals put the Bearcats in position to win a third straight national title. Cincinnati held a 15-point lead over Loyola (Ill.) in the second half of the championship game, only to have the Ramblers come back to win, 60\u201358, in overtime. Cincinnati led the nation in defense.\n* '''1991\u201392''' The Bearcats opened play in the [[Great Midwest Conference]] and marked their debut in this new league by sharing the regular season title and winning the tournament crown. Cincinnati made its first appearance in two decades in the Top 20 rankings. The Bearcats were seeded fourth in the Midwest Regional. UC defeated its four regional foes by an average margin of 20.8 points to make its sixth appearance in the Final Four. Michigan's [[Fab Five (University of Michigan)|\"Fab Five\"]] edged UC, 76\u201372, in the semifinal.\n* '''1999\u201300''' Cincinnati was the nation's top team and [[Kenyon Martin]] was college basketball's top player. UC was ranked No. 1 in the national polls for 12 of 18 weeks and Martin made a clean sweep of the national player of the year awards (Naismith, Wooden, Rupp, Robertson, NABC). The Bearcats tied a school record for victories with a 29\u20134 record and won their fifth straight [[Conference USA]] regular season title. UC seemed poised for a run for the national title until Martin suffered a broken leg in the [[Conference USA Men's Basketball Tournament|Conference USA Tournament]]. Martin was a unanimous first team [[All-American]] with Pete Mickeal earning honorable mention honors. Cincinnati went from the #1 team in the country to a 2-seed in the NCAA Tournament, and fell to [[Tulsa]] in the 2nd round.\n* '''2001\u201302''' Unranked in the major polls at the start of the season, the Bearcats posted a 31\u20134 record\u2014setting a new standard for victories\u2014won a seventh consecutive Conference USA regular season championship, captured the C-USA tournament crown and earned their first-ever No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament. [[Steve Logan]] earned his second straight Conference USA Player of the Year award, was a consensus All-American and a finalist for every national player of the year honor. The Bearcats were upset in the 2nd round to 8-seed UCLA in a double-overtime thriller.\n* '''2011\u201312''' After starting the season 5\u20133 with bad losses and dealing with the aftermath and suspensions from the [[2011 Crosstown Shootout brawl|Crosstown Shootout brawl]], UC's season was already on the brinks halfway through December. The Bearcats then went on a run against fantastic competition and wound up beating 8 ranked teams, the most ranked wins in any Cincinnati season in history. The biggest win came against the 31\u20131 and #2 [[2011\u201312 Syracuse Orange men's basketball team|Syracuse Orange]] in the [[2012 Big East Men's Basketball Tournament|Big East Tournament]] semifinals. The Bearcats went on to the Sweet 16 where they lost to Ohio State. The latter half of this season is considered by many to be a big turning point in [[Mick Cronin (basketball coach)|Mick Cronin]]'s coaching career.

They spent the entire season in the national polls, peaking at #5 - this was fueled by their defensive prowess which ranked second overall nationally. They earned their first outright American Athletic Conference regular season and tournament championships and tied the school record for wins, going 31\u20135. Their season ended with a second round NCAA tournament upset to Nevada who tied the record for the 2nd largest NCAA Tournament comeback- surmounting a 22-point deficit to win by 2.\n\n==Notable games==\n'''01/09/1958 \u2013 Cincinnati 118, Seton Hall 54''': 19-year-old sophomore [[Oscar Robertson]] (\"The Big O\") dropped 56 points, scoring more than all of Seton Hall, and caught the attention of New York City in a road win. His 56 points, at the time, was a [[Madison Square Garden]] record.\n\n'''03/25/1961 \u2013 Cincinnati 70, Ohio State 65''': The Buckeyes were the defending champs, 27\u20130 and No. 1 in the nation. They took on state rival No. 2 Cincinnati in the National Championship. A layup by Ohio State's [[Bobby Knight]] sent the game into overtime, tied at 61. Cincy, led by [[Paul Hogue]] and [[Bob Wiesenhahn]], took it from there, winning, 70\u201365, giving the Bearcats their first basketball title in school history.\n\n'''03/24/1962 \u2013 Cincinnati 71, Ohio State 59''': Cincinnati and Ohio State, again ranked Nos. 1 and 2 at the end of the regular season, became the first teams to play each other in two consecutive NCAA championship games. Unlike the year before, this game was not close. Cincy led by eight at the half and won by 12 as Paul Hogue and [[Tom Thacker (basketball)|Tom Thacker]] led the way with 22 and 21 points, respectively. When it was over, the Bearcats' second-year coach [[Ed Jucker]] had a pair of NCAA titles in two tries.\n\n'''03/23/1963 \u2013 Loyola (Ill.) 60, Cincinnati 58''': Despite its No. 3 ranking and a scoring average of 91.8, nobody expected Loyola of Chicago to beat Cincinnati,{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} especially when the Ramblers fell behind by 15 in the second half. But Loyola rallied to send the game into OT and won the title on a last-second rebound and basket by [[Vic Rouse (basketball)|Vic Rouse]].\n\n'''12/21/1981 \u2013 Cincinnati 75, Bradley 73''': This contest is still listed as the [[1981 Bradley vs. Cincinnati men's basketball game|longest game of NCAA Division I history]], reaching seven overtimes.<ref>https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ImEeAAAAIBAJ&sjid=eMgEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4344%2C5245644</ref> Reserve forward Doug Schloemer hit the decisive shot, a left-wing 15-footer with one second remaining in the seventh overtime. If he had missed that jump shot, it would have gone to an eighth overtime.\n\n'''12/12/1984 \u2013 Cincinnati 69, UAB 67''': UAB had a one-point lead, but in the waning seconds, Tony Wilson, who was on a track scholarship, hit a 54-foot shot beyond half-court at the buzzer to give Cincinnati a 2-point win at [[Riverfront Coliseum]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n'''11/25/1989 \u2013 Cincinnati 66, Minnesota 64''': It was the school's first game under [[Bob Huggins]], in their new arena, the [[Fifth Third Arena|Shoemaker Center]]. Walk-on Steve Sanders, who was also the school's football team's wide receiver for four years, hit the buzzer-beating three-pointer to give UC a 66\u201364 win over No. 20 Minnesota.\n\n'''01/23/1993 \u2013 Cincinnati 40, UAB 38''': The No. 9 Bearcats were heavily favored playing at home vs an 11\u20137 UAB team. It was an ugly, very low-scoring affair, where UAB led at halftime 15\u201311. In a tie game with seconds left, [[Corie Blount]] for UC had his shot blocked. It was kicked around and [[Nick Van Exel]] recovered it to put up a long two-pointer at the buzzer. Nothing but net. Cats won 40\u201338.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n'''12/17/1994 \u2013 Cincinnati 81, Wyoming 80''': UC trailed to Wyoming all game, but when down 2 in the final seconds, LaZelle Durden put up a 3-point attempt as the final horn sounded. He was fouled, but hit all three free throws with no time on the clock. UC won, 81\u201380, and Durden's 45 points were the most by a Bearcat in 34 years.\n\n'''03/12/1995 \u2013 Cincinnati 67, St. Louis 65''': LaZelle Durden fired in the game-winning three-pointer with 1.2 seconds to play in the conference championship game over Saint Louis, giving the Bearcats a 67\u201365 victory and clinching an NCAA Tournament berth.\n\n'''02/11/1996 \u2013 Arizona, 79, Cincinnati 76''': The Bearcats had the ball under their own hoop in a tie game vs Arizona with just a few seconds left. [[Miles Simon]] stripped the ball from [[Danny Fortson]], and hit a three-quarter-court buzzer-beater to beat UC, 79\u201376.\n\n'''02/06/1997 \u2013 Cincinnati 65, Tulane 64''': The game was tied at 63 with 2 seconds left, and UC had the ball. Bobby Brannan threw the ball the length of the court. Danny Fortson made the catch near the hoop and laid it in with 0.2 seconds remaining. The majority of the Bearcats bench stormed the court in excitement, thinking the game was over. Cincinnati was given a technical foul for the incident, awarding Tulane two free throws and the ball. Honeycutt only made one of two free throws, and Tulane was unable to score with 0.2 seconds left. Cincinnati won by one.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n'''02/19/1998 \u2013 Cincinnati 93, UAB 76''': All-American [[Ruben Patterson]] was awoken at 6:00 in the morning by Bob Huggins. The coach broke the news to him that his mother had a heart attack overnight and died. Patterson played the game that night anyway, after spending all day crying. He scored a career-high 32 points in a 93\u201376 win over UAB.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n'''03/15/1998 \u2013 West Virginia 75, Cincinnati 74''': Cincinnati took a 2-point lead with 7.1 seconds remaining against West Virginia in the second round of the NCAA Tournament.

West Virginia advanced to the Sweet Sixteen with a 75\u201374 win.\n\n'''11/29/1998 \u2013 Cincinnati 77, Duke 75''': No. 14 Cincinnati took on No. 1 Duke in the [[Great Alaska Shootout]] championship. In a tie game with 3 seconds left, Cincinnati ran a \"hook-and-ladder\" type play, that had [[Kenyon Martin]] hit an open [[Melvin Levett]] sprinting towards the hoop. Levett dunked the ball with one second left, and the Bearcats won, 77\u201375. As of the 2019 season, it is their lone win vs a No. 1 team.\n\n'''03/02/2000 \u2013 Cincinnati 66, DePaul 64''': DePaul led the No. 2 Bearcats by 17, and by 10 with under 4 minutes remaining.

Trailing by 2, [[Gerry McNamara]] of Syracuse came down and hit a running one-handed three pointer with 0.5 seconds left, giving Syracuse a one-point win. Cincinnati, who was a bubble team, just barely missed the NCAA Tournament (even with a [[Joe Lunardi]] prediction of a 9 seed on the morning of Selection Sunday), snapping their streak of 14 straight appearances.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=260672132|title=Syracuse vs. Cincinnati \u2013 Game Recap \u2013 March 8, 2006 \u2013 ESPN|author=|date=|work=go.com|accessdate=April 20, 2017}}</ref>\n\n'''12/10/2011 \u2013 Xavier 76, Cincinnati 53''': The 2011 rivalry game with Xavier ended in a bench-clearing brawl between the two teams, with the officials calling an end to the game with less than 10 seconds left.

In a game that was close the majority of the way, Purdue began to pull away down the stretch. Down 7 with 48 seconds to go, the Bearcats hit a three pointer, forced a turnover, and made an and-one layup, all within 6 seconds to cut it to one. Down two with 7 seconds left, sophomore [[Troy Caupain]] drove to the hoop and hit a floater that dramatically spun around the rim, hung on the rim for a second, and fell in, as time expired.

In a modern classic under the gaze of a hostile sellout crowd, both squads went back and forth throughout the matchup. Down 1 with 9.3 seconds left under their own basket, Wichita State whipped it around to senior three point ace: [[Conner Frankamp]]. UC anticipated the mismatch with sophomore Center Nysier Brooks on the perimeter. Frankamp's potential game-winner missed wide with State corralling the offensive rebound; however, fellow UC sophomore Jarron Cumberland laid down some suffocating defense under the basket, causing their putback to miss off the backside of the backboard as time expired.

Nevada mounted a furious comeback, scoring 16 straight points over the next 3 minutes. The game continued to be touch and go for the remainder of the half, with an overwhelming amount of foul calls against the Bearcats.

After defeating SMU (82-74) and Wichita State (66-63) in the AAC quarterfinals and semifinals respectively, the Bearcats scored a redemptive victory. AAC Player of the year Jarron Cumberland scored 33 points and was named tournament most outstanding player as the Bearcats successfully defended their AAC Tournament Crown and delivered Houston's only double digit loss of the [[2018\u201319 Houston Cougars men's basketball team|2018-2019]] season.\n\n'''03/07/2020 - Cincinnati 64, Temple 63''': The Bearcats under new coach John Brannen endured an up and down season - epitomized by a Senior Day where they fell behind underdog Temple by as many as 14 points.

After a hectic 2 minutes, Temple took the lead on a late 3 with 10 seconds remaining. Out of timeouts, Jarron Cumberland drove down the court but his layup ricocheted off the back iron; however, Trevon Scott heroically made a putback layup in the waning seconds to give the Bearcats a dramatic win.

The arena is on-campus and has a capacity of 12,012 (with room for overflow). It is located in the Myrl H. Shoemaker Center, which was also the name of the arena until 2005, when it was named for Cincinnati-based [[Fifth Third Bank]]. It is still popularly known as \"The Shoe\". The Bearcats closed out Fifth Third Arena (pre-2018 renovation) with an all-time home record of 389\u201379 ({{Winning percentage|389|79}}), along with an active 26-game home winning streak. The Bearcats held a 42-game win streak from 1997\u20132000 as well. In the 1999\u20132000 season, every Bearcat home game was sold out. During the [[Bob Huggins]] era, it was known as one of the most hostile arenas in the nation due to the high decibel levels typical of his tenure.\n\nOn December 15, 2015, The UC Board of Trustees approved an $87-million, privately funded renovation of Fifth Third Arena.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fifth Third Arena Project Receives Board Approval|url=http://www.gobearcats.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/121515aaa.html|website=GoBearcats.com|publisher=CBSi|accessdate=16 December 2015}}</ref> Proposed improvements to the facility, include the creation of a 360-degree seating bowl, new HD scoreboard, ribbon boards, sound system, an LED lighting system which will allow for enhanced gameday presentation, new restroom and concession facilities, a new upper-level concourse with its own fan amenities, expanded food and beverage options and a new main entrance and plaza with centralized ticketing and guest services.

[[University of Cincinnati]] in [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]]. The school's team competes in [[NCAA Division I]] as part of the [[American Athletic Conference]]. The Bearcats are coached by [[John Brannen (basketball)|John Brannen]], who has been UC's head coach since 2019.\n\nWith over 1800 all-time wins, the Bearcats are one of the 15 winningest basketball programs of all-time. The school's merits include 2 National Titles, 6 Final Fours, and 33 [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]] appearances. As of 2019, Cincinnati has appeared in 9 consecutive NCAA Tournaments, and 23 of the last 28, with an all-time tournament record of 46\u201332. There have also been 42 All-American honors issued to Bearcats as well, while 34 have gone on to play in the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] (4 were active as of the 2018-19 NBA season).\n\nCincinnati has been playing its home games since 1989 at [[Fifth Third Arena]], which received an $87 million renovation for the 2018 season. The Bearcats played their 2017\u201318 season at [[BB&T Arena]] on the campus of [[Northern Kentucky University]] in [[Highland Heights, Kentucky]] while their home arena was renovated. Cincinnati joined the [[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|original Big East Conference]] in 2005, which was rebranded as the [[American Athletic Conference]] (AAC) in 2013.\n\n==By the numbers==\nStatistics and NCAA all-time rankings (through the end of the 2017\u201318 season):\n* Wins: 1835 (14th)<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/schools/cincinnati/|title=Cincinnati|website=College Basketball at Sports-Reference.com|access-date=2020-03-09}}</ref>\n* Win percentage: .641 (23th)<ref name=\":0\" />\n* National Titles: 2 (T-9th)<ref>[[List of NCAA Men's Division I Basketball champions]]</ref>\n* Final Fours: 6 (T-10th)<ref>[[NCAA Men's Division I Final Four appearances by school]]</ref>\n* NCAA Tournament appearances: 33 (T-13th)<ref>[[NCAA Men's Division I Tournament bids by school]]</ref>\n* NCAA Tournament games played: 77 (16th)<ref name=\"NCAA Tournament wins\"/>\n* NCAA Tournament wins: 46 (17th)<ref name=\"NCAA Tournament wins\">[[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament all-time team records]]</ref>\n* Weeks in the AP Top 25: 434 (12th)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collegepollarchive.com/mbasketball/ap/app_total.cfm?sort=totapp&from=1949&to=2018|title=Total AP Men's BB Poll Appearances Summary \u2013 College Poll Archive \u2013 Historical College Football and Basketball Polls and Rankings|author=|date=|work=collegepollarchive.com|accessdate=April 20, 2017}}</ref>\n* Weeks in the AP Top 10: 210 (15th)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collegepollarchive.com/mbasketball/ap/app_total.cfm?sort=top10app&from=1949&to=2018|title=Total AP Men's BB Poll Appearances Summary \u2013 College Poll Archive \u2013 Historical College Football and Basketball Polls and Rankings|author=|date=|work=collegepollarchive.com|accessdate=April 20, 2017}}</ref>\n* Weeks at No. 1 in the AP Poll: 45 (7th)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collegepollarchive.com/mbasketball/ap/app_total.cfm?sort=num1app&from=1949&to=2018|title=Total AP Men's BB Poll Appearances Summary \u2013 College Poll Archive \u2013 Historical College Football and Basketball Polls and Rankings|author=|date=|work=collegepollarchive.com|accessdate=April 20, 2017}}</ref>\n* 14 consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances from 1992\u20132005 (T-11th longest streak all-time)<ref>[[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament consecutive appearances]]</ref>\n* 10 consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances from 2011\u2013present (T-5th longest active streak)<ref>[[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament consecutive appearances]]</ref>\n* First-team Consensus All-American selections: 8 (T-22nd)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/m_basketball_RB/2012/Awards.pdf|title=All-American Award Winners|author=|date=|work=ncaa.org|accessdate=April 20, 2017}}</ref>\n* Current players in the NBA: 2 (T-26th)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/article/2018-10-16/colleges-most-players-nba-opening-day-rosters|title=Where the NBA Players Come From|first=Jim|last=Sukup|date=|work=ncaa.com|accessdate=October 16, 2018}}</ref>\n* First school to reach three consecutive National Title games (1961\u201363)<ref name=\"UC Basketball history\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gobearcats.com/datadump/sports/mbball/history/history.html|title=UCBearcats \u2013 Official Athletic Website of the University of Cincinnati|author=|date=|work=gobearcats.com|accessdate=April 20, 2017}}</ref>\n* First school to reach five consecutive Final Fours (1959\u201363)<ref name=\"UC Basketball history\"/>\n\n==History==\n\n===1901-1940s \u2013 The beginning===\nBasketball formally debuted as a selected varsity team in 1901 and played nine games. Cincinnati, in its first season lost to [[Yale]] but later defeated a team from the [[University of Kentucky]] while compiling a 5\u20134 record, with the remaining games being against non-collegiate teams. Home games during this time were played in a gym in the basement of McMicken Hall. Pillars on the court gave UC a home court advantage. UC experienced moderate success in the early days, with the main highlights being them winning several conference championships in both the [[Buckeye Athletic Association]] and the [[Mid-American Conference]].\n\n===1954\u20131958 \u2013 The start of something special===\nCincinnati opened its new on-campus arena, [[Armory Fieldhouse]], with a 97\u201365 win over [[Indiana]] in 1954. One of the first of Cincinnati's long list of standouts was [[Jack Twyman]], who earned [[All-America]] status in 1954\u201355. He went on to NBA stardom and is in the [[Basketball Hall of Fame]].\n[[Oscar Robertson]] made his debut in 1957, and quickly emerged as one of the top college players in the country. \"The Big O\" is still widely recognized as one of the greatest to ever play the sport\u2014college or professional. A unanimous three-time All-American, he was college basketball's all-time leading scorer at the close of his career. His 33.8 scoring average today ranks third on the NCAA career charts, and he has the NBA's third-most career assists. The Bearcats celebrated their entry into the [[Missouri Valley Conference]] by winning the league title. Cincinnati made its first NCAA tournament appearance in 1958, losing to [[Kansas State]] in overtime at the Midwest Regional.\n\n===1958\u20131964 \u2013 A run unlike any other===\nSparked by the exploits of Robertson, who became the first player to lead the nation in scoring in three consecutive seasons, Cincinnati advanced to the Final Four in 1958\u201359 and 1959\u201360, settling for third place both years. Then the Bearcats, with a rookie head coach ([[Ed Jucker]]) and without Robertson, won their first national title in 1960\u201361. Then to prove that its 1961 championship was no fluke, UC repeated as national champion in 1961\u201362. Cincinnati made a fifth-straight trip to the Final Four in 1962\u201363, and narrowly missed capturing a third-straight national crown when Loyola (Ill.) overcame a 15-point deficit and defeated the Bearcats by a basket, 60\u201358, in overtime.\n\nDuring those five seasons, UC recorded a 37-game win streak and posted a 161\u201316 ledger. The five straight Final Four appearances is a feat topped only by UCLA. [[Connie Dierking]] (1958), [[Ralph Davis (basketball)|Ralph Davis]] (1960), [[Bob Wiesenhahn]] (1961), [[Paul Hogue]] (1961, 1962), [[Tom Thacker (basketball)|Tom Thacker]] (1963), [[Tony Yates]] (1963), [[Ron Bonham]] (1963, 1964) and [[George Wilson (basketball, born 1942)|George Wilson]] (1963) were accorded All-American recognition with Wilson playing on the U.S. 1964 Olympic gold medal team.\n\n===1970s \u2013 Continued success===\nThe Bearcats during the 1970s compiled a 170\u201385 record (.667). Cincinnati inaugurated the [[Metro Conference]] by winning the league's first two tournament championships and made four consecutive post-season appearances from 1974\u20131977, including a Sweet Sixteen appearance in 1975. [[Jim Ard]] (1970), [[Lloyd Batts]] (1973), [[Steve Collier]] (1976), [[Gary Yoder]] (1977), [[Bob Miller (basketball)|Bob Miller]] (1978) and [[Pat Cummings]] (1979) earned All-American recognition. Cummings closed his career as UC's No. 2 leading scorer of all-time.\n\n===1980\u20131988 \u2013 Down in the dumps===\nCincinnati fell into exceptionally hard times during the 1980s, going 112\u2013142 over the course of the decade. [[Tony Yates]], a member of the national championship teams in the 1960s, was hired as head coach in 1983. In his first season in 1983\u201384, UC went 3\u201325 (0\u201314 in conference), the school's worst season (winning-percentage-wise) since going 1\u20139 in 1915. After several unremarkable campaigns thereafter, Yates was fired after the 1989 season. The Bearcats of the 1980s failed to make a single NCAA tournament, and only had one postseason appearance in the 1985 [[1985 National Invitation Tournament|NIT]].\n\n===1989\u20132005 \u2013 Back into the national spotlight===\n[[Bob Huggins]], the former head coach at the University of Akron, was named head coach at UC prior to the 1989\u201390 season. Taking over a team with a proud history but one that had not had any legitimate success in over a decade, Huggins quickly turned things around and rekindled the national championship expectations of the past. Posting winning records in each of his first two seasons, Huggins would soon prove that his team was for real and in only his third season at the helm he directed UC to the 1992 Final Four. The 1992 team that went on to lose to Michigan's \"Fab Five\" in the Final Four, would set a high standard of success that would last for years to come. The Bearcats advanced to the Elite Eight of the NCAA tournament three times, and reached the Sweet 16 four times while Huggins was coach. Cincinnati also won its conference season and/or tournament title in 12 years out of a 13-year span (1992\u20132004). UC was also one of the top ranked teams of this time, often being ranked in the top 10 if not number one in the country. Huggin's team merits include claiming eight league tournament titles and 10 regular season crowns in addition to appearing in 14 consecutive NCAA Tournaments (1992\u20132005).\n\nFifteen Bearcats had garnered first team all-conference honors during this era with three of those, [[Danny Fortson]], [[Kenyon Martin]] and [[Steve Logan]], picking up a total of four C-USA Most Outstanding Player Awards. Fortson, [[Nick Van Exel]], [[Ruben Patterson]], Bobby Brannen, [[Melvin Levett]], Logan, Martin and Pete Mickeal have joined Cincinnati's list of All-Americans. Fortson was a consensus first team All-American in 1996\u201397 after receiving second team recognition in 1995\u201396. Martin was college basketball's top player of the 1999\u20132000 season, making a clean sweep of the national player of the year awards. Logan was a consensus All-American in 2001\u201302 and a finalist for every national player of the year award. Several Bearcats were NBA Draft Picks, including Martin being the number one overall pick in 2000.\n\nHuggins was forced to resign by school president [[Nancy Zimpher]] in August 2005. Zimpher was angered by the lackluster academic performance of Huggins' teams (he routinely only graduated 30 percent of his players), and felt that Huggins didn't fit in with her plan to upgrade UC's academic reputation. Huggins hadn't helped his standing with Zimpher when he was arrested for [[driving under the influence|DUI]] in 2004.<ref name=\"WSJ\">{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB114367599328911693?mod=todays_us_personal_journal | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Skip | last=Rozin | title=The Basketball Coach Vs. the College President | date=March 30, 2006}}</ref><ref name=\"wlwt.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wlwt.com/sports/4885953/detail.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201172318/http://www.wlwt.com/sports/4885953/detail.html |archivedate=2008-12-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/news/story?id=2141189|title=Text of letter sent to Cincinnati coach Bob Huggins|date=23 August 2005|website=ESPN.com}}</ref>  This decision was met wide widespread criticism among virtually everyone connected to the program, creating a situation that would not bode well for the team in the near future. Looking to stay within the program, the school immediately promoted assistant coach [[Andy Kennedy (basketball coach)|Andy Kennedy]] as interim head coach for the 2005\u201306 season.\n\n===2006\u20132009 \u2013 Resurrecting a gutted program===\nIn the spring of 2006, [[Mick Cronin (basketball)|Mick Cronin]] was hired as head coach, replacing interim coach [[Andy Kennedy (basketball coach)|Andy Kennedy]] after the dismissal of [[Bob Huggins]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/news/story?id=2382844|title=Cronin introduced as head coach at Cincinnati|author=|date=March 24, 2006|work=espn.com|accessdate=April 20, 2017}}</ref> Cronin was tasked with picking up the pieces from a depleted program after Huggins was abruptly asked to resign three months before the 2005 season, and a temporary coach in Kennedy for the previous season. Due to the school having little-to-no recruiting going on for around a full calendar year, Cronin was forced to scrounge for players. He even had a couple players on the school's football team play, one being future NFL linebacker [[Connor Barwin]].\n\nAlthough Cronin's teams struggled early in his UC career, he improved the school's win total each of his first five seasons. After two straight losing seasons, UC began to get back on track under Cronin in the 2008\u201309 season with an 18\u201314 record. This was then followed by an NIT appearance and a brief return to the Top 25 polls during the 2009\u201310 campaign.\n\n===2010\u2013present \u2013 Return to winning ways===\nDespite the surroundings, Cincinnati began the retooling process, becoming the only program from a major conference to improve its win total every season from 2007 to 2011, building from 11 wins in 2007 to 26 victories and a return to the NCAA Tournament in 2011.\nNow a fixture at the Big Dance, Cincinnati can include itself among an elite list of six programs appearing in eight [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament consecutive appearances|consecutive NCAA Tournaments]], along with [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]], [[Gonzaga Bulldogs men's basketball|Gonzaga]], [[Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball|Kansas]], [[Michigan State Spartans men's basketball|Michigan State]] and [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina]]. This run of 9 consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances by Cincinnati would see UC advance to the Round of 32 five times and to the Sweet 16 once as of the 2018\u201319 season.\n\nDuring the 2014-15 season, Mick Cronin discovered he had an arterial dissection and sat out the rest of the season, last coaching December 17th against [[San Diego State Aztecs men's basketball|San Diego State]].<ref>https://www.si.com/college-basketball/2015/01/05/cincinnati-mick-cronin-health</ref> Assistant Coach, [[Larry Davis (basketball)|Larry Davis]] took the reigns and lead the team onto a respectable season and classic overtime victory over [[Purdue Boilermakers men's basketball|Purdue]] in the first round of the NCAA Tournament.\n\nIn 2013\u201314 season and 2017\u201318 season Cincinnati were American Athletic Conference regular season champions and in 2017\u201318 and 2018\u20132019 seasons Cincinnati won the [[American Athletic Conference Men's Basketball Tournament]]. During this time many notable players came to Cincinnati with several progressing to the NBA, such as [[Sean Kilpatrick]], [[Troy Caupain]], [[Jacob Evans]], and [[Gary Clark (basketball)|Gary Clark]]. The Bearcats also featured consecutive AAC Player-of-the-Year (POY) winners in Gary Clark and [[Jarron Cumberland]].\n\nOn April 9, 2019, it was announced that Mick Cronin would be leaving Cincinnati to become the next head coach of the [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA Bruins]] after UCLA had fired Coach [[Steve Alford]] earlier in the season (ironically, his firing was due in part to a blowout loss to the [[2018\u201319 Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball team|Bearcats]]). On April 14, 2019, it was announced that [[John Brannen (basketball)| John Brannen]] was being hired as the new head coach.\n\n==Notable seasons==\n* '''1959\u201360''' [[Oscar Robertson]] scored a school record 62 points in an early-February game vs. [[North Texas State]] and in the process became the NCAA's all-time leading career scorer. Robertson claimed national player of the year honors for the third straight year while Cincinnati won its third straight [[Missouri Valley Conference|Missouri Valley]] title. The Bearcats made their second trip to the Final Four. [[California]] again turned back UC's title hopes as UC finished third. George Smith stepped down as head coach to become athletic director, capping a career in which he posted a 154\u201356 record in eight years.\n* '''1960\u201361''' Largely an unknown team, without Robertson, and with a new head coach, [[Ed Jucker]], in command, Cincinnati stumbled to a 5\u20133 start. The Bearcats then won their next 22 contests, garnering a league title, a third straight trip to the Final Four, and a national championship. In the first-ever championship game matchup of two teams from the same state, UC defeated [[Ohio State]] in overtime, 70\u201365.\n* '''1961\u201362''' Cincinnati fashioned a 28\u20132 record, but the Bearcats had to defeat [[Bradley]] in a league playoff game to defend their national title. UC won the Midwest Regional to earn its fourth straight trip to the Final Four. After edging [[UCLA]], 72\u201370, in the semifinals, Cincinnati became a repeat champion with a 71\u201359 win over Ohio State. [[Paul Hogue]] was the tournament's Most Outstanding Player.\n* '''1962\u201363''' UC breezed to its fifth straight [[Missouri Valley Conference]] crown and, after winning the Midwest Regional, a fifth straight trip to the Final Four. An 80\u201346 win over [[Oregon]] in the semifinals put the Bearcats in position to win a third straight national title. Cincinnati held a 15-point lead over Loyola (Ill.) in the second half of the championship game, only to have the Ramblers come back to win, 60\u201358, in overtime. Cincinnati led the nation in defense.\n* '''1991\u201392''' The Bearcats opened play in the [[Great Midwest Conference]] and marked their debut in this new league by sharing the regular season title and winning the tournament crown. Cincinnati made its first appearance in two decades in the Top 20 rankings. The Bearcats were seeded fourth in the Midwest Regional.

The Bearcats then went on a run against fantastic competition and wound up beating 8 ranked teams, the most ranked wins in any Cincinnati season in history. The biggest win came against the 31\u20131 and #2 [[2011\u201312 Syracuse Orange men's basketball team|Syracuse Orange]] in the [[2012 Big East Men's Basketball Tournament|Big East Tournament]] semifinals. The Bearcats went on to the Sweet 16 where they lost to Ohio State.

The Bearcats closed out Fifth Third Arena (pre-2018 renovation) with an all-time home record of 389\u201379 ({{Winning percentage|389|79}}), along with an active 26-game home winning streak. The Bearcats held a 42-game win streak from 1997\u20132000 as well. In the 1999\u20132000 season, every Bearcat home game was sold out. During the [[Bob Huggins]] era, it was known as one of the most hostile arenas in the nation due to the high decibel levels typical of his tenure.\n\nOn December 15, 2015, The UC Board of Trustees approved an $87-million, privately funded renovation of Fifth Third Arena.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fifth Third Arena Project Receives Board Approval|url=http://www.gobearcats.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/121515aaa.html|website=GoBearcats.com|publisher=CBSi|accessdate=16 December 2015}}</ref> Proposed improvements to the facility, include the creation of a 360-degree seating bowl, new HD scoreboard, ribbon boards, sound system, an LED lighting system which will allow for enhanced gameday presentation, new restroom and concession facilities, a new upper-level concourse with its own fan amenities, expanded food and beverage options and a new main entrance and plaza with centralized ticketing and guest services. The renovated arena also will feature upgraded locker room spaces, expanded premium seating options, including a courtside club, arena club and concourse club as well as enclosed suites, loge seating, a new Bearcats Lounge and super suites.  During the meeting, trustee Rob Richardson Jr. said the upgraded facility would support the university's objective to join a power athletic conference and in student-athlete recruitment.  Construction began in April 2017 and was completed in fall 2018.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Tweh|first1=Bowdeya|title=UC pushes back Fifth Third Arena renovation|url=http://www.cincinnati.com/story/sports/2015/12/15/fifth-third-arena-renovation/77348790/|website=Cincinnati.com|publisher=Cincinnati Enquirer|accessdate=16 December 2015}}</ref> During the 2017\u201318 school year, men's basketball home games were moved to [[BB&T Arena]] at [[Northern Kentucky University]] in [[Highland Heights, Kentucky]], while women's basketball and volleyball home games were moved to the campus of [[St. Ursula Academy (Cincinnati, Ohio)|St. Ursula Academy]].<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.gobearcats.com/sports/w-baskbl/spec-rel/040317aaa.html |title=Athletics Announces 2017\u201318 Playing Site For WBB & VB |publisher=[[Cincinnati Bearcats]] |date=April 3, 2017 |accessdate=April 20, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Bearcats christened the newly renovated arena in a rare home game vs. Ohio State on November 7, 2018. \n\n===Season-by-season record at Fifth Third Arena===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n{{CollegePrimaryHeader|team=Cincinnati Bearcats|Season|Record}}\n|-\n|1989\u201390 || 10\u20134 \n|-\n|1990\u201391 || 12\u20134\n|-\n|1991\u201392 || 15\u20132\n|-\n|1992\u201393 || '''''14\u20130'''''\n|-\n|1993\u201394 || 18\u20132\n|-\n|1994\u201395 || 9\u20134\n|-\n|1995\u201396 || 13\u20131\n|-\n|1996\u201397 || 13\u20133\n|-\n|1997\u201398 || 19\u20131\n|-\n|1998\u201399 || '''''14\u20130'''''\n|-\n|1999\u201300 || 13\u20131\n|-\n|2000\u201301 || 11\u20133\n|-\n|2001\u201302 || '''''15\u20130'''''\n|-\n|2002\u201303 || 13\u20133\n|-\n|2003\u201304 || 18\u20131\n|-\n|2004\u201305 || 15\u20132\n|-\n|2005\u201306 || 14\u20135\n|-\n|2006\u201307 || 10\u20138\n|-\n|2007\u201308 || 10\u20137\n|-\n|2008\u201309 || 14\u20135\n|-\n|2009\u201310 || 12\u20134\n|-\n|2010\u201311 || 15\u20133\n|-\n|2011\u201312 || 14\u20134\n|-\n|2012\u201313 || 13\u20135\n|-\n|2013\u201314 || 18\u20131\n|-\n|2014\u201315 || 15\u20133\n|-\n|2015\u201316 || 14\u20133\n|-\n|2016\u201317 || '''''18\u20130'''''\n|-\n|2017\u201318 || 0\u20130(**)\n|-\n|2018\u201319 || 16\u20132\n|-\n|2019\u201320 || 13\u20132\n|}\n\n'''OVERALL: 418\u201384 ({{Winning percentage|418|84}})'''\n\n(**)(14\u20131 record at [[BB&T Arena]])\n\n==Season by season results==\n{{CBB Yearly Record Start | type = team | conference = | postseason = }}\n{{CBB Yearly Record Subhead\n|name=[[Henry S.
