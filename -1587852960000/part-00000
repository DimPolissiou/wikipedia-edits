However some disagree and believe the presence of Arabic came before during the [[Delhi Sultanate]]. Arabic is used in many [[Muslim]] congregations such as the weekly [[Jumu'ah]] Salah in which a sermon ([[khutbah]]) is given in Arabic in addition to Bengali. In the [[Constitution of Bangladesh]], there are two references to Arabic to in the introduction and Part I of the constitution. The document begins with the Arabic phrase [[Basmala|\u0628\u0650\u0633\u0652\u0645\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u064e\u0651\u062d\u0652\u0645\u0670\u0646\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u064e\u0651\u062d\u0650\u064a\u0652\u0645\u0650]] which is translated as \u201cIn the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful\u201d. Article 2A declares that Islam is the state religion of the republic.\n\nArabic is the religious language of Muslims. The [[Quran]], [[Sunnah]], [[Hadith]] and Muslim theology is taught in Arabic with Bengali translation. The [[Bangladeshi diaspora]] living in the [[Middle East]] has further increased the number of people who can speak Arabic in Bangladesh. Arabic is taught as a religious language in [[mosque]]s, schools, colleges, universities and [[Madrasah|madrassahs]] as well as in tradition [[Bengali Muslim]] households. Arabic is an obligatory subject in the Madrasah education of Bangladesh.

However some disagree and believe the presence of Arabic came before during the [[Delhi Sultanate]]. Arabic is used in many [[Muslim]] congregations such as the weekly [[Jumu'ah]] Salah in which a sermon ([[khutbah]]) is given in Arabic in addition to Bengali. In the [[Constitution of Bangladesh]], there are two references to Arabic to in the introduction and Part I of the constitution. The document begins with the Arabic phrase [[Basmala|\u0628\u0650\u0633\u0652\u0645\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u064e\u0651\u062d\u0652\u0645\u0670\u0646\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u064e\u0651\u062d\u0650\u064a\u0652\u0645\u0650]] which is translated as \u201cIn the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful\u201d. Article 2A declares that Islam is the state religion of the republic.\n\nArabic is the religious language of Muslims. The [[Quran]], [[Sunnah]], [[Hadith]] and Muslim theology is taught in Arabic with Bengali translation. The [[Bangladeshi diaspora]] living in the [[Middle East]] has further increased the number of people who can speak Arabic in Bangladesh. Arabic is taught as a religious language in [[mosque]]s, schools, colleges, universities and [[Madrasah|madrassahs]] as well as in tradition [[Bengali Muslim]] households. Arabic is an obligatory subject in the Madrasah education of Bangladesh. A majority of Bangladesh's Muslim population has had some form of formal or informal education in the reading, writing and pronunciation of the Arabic language as part of their religious education.\n\n===Persian===\n{{Main|Persian language in South Asia}}\n*[http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Persian \"Persian in Bangladesh\"] \u2014 Banglapedia\n\nFrom ancient times Bengal and Persia had been in contact with each other.

The influence of the language spread rapidly after it gained the status of court language and it was the official for over 600 years (1203-1837 AD).\n\n===Urdu===\n{{Main|Bengali language movement}}\n{{See also|Biharis in Bangladesh}}\n[[Urdu]] (\u0627\u0631\u062f\u0648\u202c) was an official language in post-partition 1947 to 1971.
