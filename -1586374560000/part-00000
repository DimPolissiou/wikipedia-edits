Coptic, the language of Christian Egypt before the Arab conquest, has been entirely replaced by Arabic except in the church liturgy.

By that point the dam, now in a poor state of repair, was finally breached. The [[irrigation]] system was lost, the people abandoned the site within a year or so, and the temple fell into disrepair and was eventually covered by sand.

The term \"A'raab\" mirrors the term Assyrians used to describe the closely related nomads they defeated in Syria. The [[Qur'an]] does not use the word {{transl|ar|\u02bfarab}}, only the [[Arabic nouns and adjectives#Nisba|nisba]] adjective {{transl|ar|\u02bfarabiy}}. The Qur'an calls itself {{transl|ar|\u02bfarabiy}}, \"Arabic\", and {{transl|ar|Mubin}}, \"clear\". The two qualities are connected for example in ayat [[Az-Zukhruf|43]].2\u20133, \"By the ''clear'' Book: We have made it an ''Arabic'' recitation in order that you may understand\". The Qur'an became regarded as the prime example of the {{transl|ar|al-\u02bfarabiyya}}, the language of the Arabs. The term ''[[\u02bei\u02bfr\u0101b]]'' has the same root and refers to a particularly clear and correct mode of speech. The plural noun {{transl|ar|\u02bea\u02bfr\u0101b}} refers to the [[Bedouin]] tribes of the desert who resisted Muhammad, for example in ''[[at-Tawba]]'' 97,\n\n{{transl|ar|al-\u02bea\u02bfr\u0101bu \u02bea\u0161addu kufr\u0101n wanif\u0101q\u0101n}} \"the Bedouin are the worst in [[kufr|disbelief]] and hypocrisy\".\n\nBased on this, in early Islamic terminology, {{transl|ar|\u02bfarabiy}} referred to the language, and {{transl|ar|\u02bea\u02bfr\u0101b}} to the Arab Bedouins, carrying a negative connotation due to the Qur'anic verdict just cited. But after the [[Islamic conquest]] of the eighth century, the language of the nomadic Arabs became regarded as the most pure by the grammarians following [[Abi Ishaq]], and the term {{transl|ar|kalam al-\u02bfArab}}, \"language of the Arabs\", denoted the uncontaminated language of the Bedouins.\n\n====Classical kingdoms====\n{{main|Palmyra|Nabateans|Qedarite|Osroene|Kingdom of Araba}}\n[[File:Petra, Al-Khazneh 2.jpg|thumb|Fa\u00e7ade of [[Al Khazneh]] in [[Petra]], Jordan, built by the [[Nabateans]].]]\nProto-Arabic, or [[Ancient North Arabian]], texts give a clearer picture of the Arabs' emergence.

Their early inscriptions were in [[Aramaic]], but gradually switched to Arabic, and since they had writing, it was they who made the first inscriptions in Arabic. The [[Nabataean alphabet]] was adopted by Arabs to the south, and evolved into modern Arabic script around the 4th century. This is attested by [[Safaitic]] inscriptions (beginning in the 1st century BCE) and the many Arabic personal names in [[Nabataean]] inscriptions. From about the 2nd century BCE, a few inscriptions from [[Qaryat al-Faw]] reveal a dialect no longer considered ''proto-Arabic'', but ''pre-classical Arabic''.

Its stated aim was \"raising the level of the Arab nation to the level of modern nations.\" In the first few years of its existence, al-Fatat called for greater autonomy within a unified Ottoman state rather than Arab independence from the empire. Al-Fatat hosted the [[Arab Congress of 1913]] in Paris, the purpose of which was to discuss desired reforms with other dissenting individuals from the Arab world. However, as the Ottoman authorities cracked down on the organization's activities and members, al-Fatat went underground and demanded the complete independence and unity of the Arab provinces.<ref name=\"Choueiri166\">Choueiri, pp.166\u2013168.</ref>\n\nAfter [[World War I]], when the [[Ottoman Empire]] was overthrown by the [[British Empire]], former Ottoman colonies were divided up between the [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[France|French]] as [[League of Nations mandate]]s.\n\n===Modern period===\n[[File:Arab World maps.png|thumb|A map of the Arab world]]\nArabs in modern times live in the Arab world, which comprises 22 countries in Western Asia, North Africa, and parts of the Horn of Africa.

During the early Muslim conquests and the [[Islamic Golden Age]], the political rulers of Islam were exclusively members of the Quraysh.\n\nThe Arab presence in Iran did not begin with the [[Arab conquest of Persia]] in 633 CE. For centuries, Iranian rulers had maintained contacts with Arabs outside their borders, dealt with Arab subjects and client states (such as those of Iraq and Yemen), and settled Arab tribesmen in various parts of the Iranian plateau. It follows that the \"Arab\" conquests and settlements were by no means the exclusive work of Arabs from the [[Hejaz]] and the tribesmen of inner Arabia.

Surrounding it on land on every side were the two rival empires of Persia and Byzantium. The countries of what now make up the Arab world were divided between the two of them\u2014Iraq under Persian rule, Syria, Palestine, and North Africa part of the Byzantine Empire. They spoke a variety of different languages and were for the most part Christians, with some Jewish minorities. Their Arabization and Islamization took place with the vast expansion of Islam in the decades and centuries following the death of the Prophet in 632 CE. The Aramaic language, once dominant in the Fertile Crescent, survives in only a few remote villages and in the rituals of the Eastern churches. Coptic, the language of Christian Egypt before the Arab conquest, has been entirely replaced by Arabic except in the church liturgy. Some earlier languages have survived, notably Kurdish in Southwest Asia and Berber in North Africa, but Arabic, in one form or another, has in effect become the language of everyday speech as well as of government, commerce, and culture in what has come to be known as \"the Arab world.\"}}</ref> The Arabs forged the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun]] (632\u2013661), [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] (661\u2013750), [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] (750\u20131517) and the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] (901\u20131071) caliphates, whose borders reached southern [[France]] in the west, [[China]] in the east, [[Anatolia]] in the north, and the [[Sudan]] in the south.

Some of the settled communities in the Arabian Peninsula developed into distinctive civilizations. Sources for these civilizations are not extensive, and are limited to archaeological evidence, accounts written outside of Arabia, and Arab oral traditions later recorded by Islamic scholars. Among the most prominent civilizations was [[Dilmun]], which arose around the 4th millennium BCE and lasted to 538 BCE, and [[Thamud]], which arose around the 1st millennium BCE and lasted to about 300 CE. Additionally, from the beginning of the first millennium BCE, [[Southern Arabia]] was the home to a number of kingdoms, such as the [[Sabaean kingdom]] ({{lang-ar|\u0633\u064e\u0640\u0628\u064e\u0640\u0623|Saba'}},<ref name=\"Cite quran|34|15|e=17|s=ns\">{{cite quran|34|15|e=17|s=ns}}</ref> possibly [[Sheba]]),<ref name=\"Sheba-01\">{{cite web |url=http://www.historyfiles.co.uk/KingListsMiddEast/ArabicSaba.htm |title=Saba / Sa'abia / Sheba |accessdate=27 June 2008 |publisher=The History Files (http://www.historyfiles.co.uk) |quote=The kingdom of Saba is known to have existed in the region of Yemen. By 1000 BC caravan trains of camels journeyed from Oman in south-east Arabia to the Mediterranean. As the [[camel driver]]s passed through the [[desert]]s of Yemen, experts believe that many of them would have called in at Ma'rib. Dating from at least 1050 BC, and now barren and dry, [[Ma'rib]] was then a lush [[oasis]] teeming with [[palm tree]]s and [[introduced species|exotic]] [[plant]]s. Ideally placed, it was situated on the trade routes and with a unique [[dam]] of vast proportions. It was also one of only two main sources of [[frankincense]] (the other being [[East Africa]]), so Saba had a virtual [[monopoly]]. Ma'rib's [[wealth]] accumulated to such an extent that the city became a byword for riches beyond belief throughout the Arab world. Its people, the [[Sabeans]] \u2013 a group whose name bears the same etymological root as Saba \u2013 lived in [[South Arabia]] between the tenth and sixth centuries BC. Their main temple \u2013 [[Mahram Bilqis]], or [[temple]] of the moon god (situated about three miles (5 km) from the capital city of Ma'rib) \u2013 was so famous that it remained [[sacred]] even after the collapse of the Sabean civilisation in the sixth century BC \u2013 caused by the rerouting of the [[spice]] trail. By that point the dam, now in a poor state of repair, was finally breached. The [[irrigation]] system was lost, the people abandoned the site within a year or so, and the temple fell into disrepair and was eventually covered by sand.

Their early inscriptions were in [[Aramaic]], but gradually switched to Arabic, and since they had writing, it was they who made the first inscriptions in Arabic. The [[Nabataean alphabet]] was adopted by Arabs to the south, and evolved into modern Arabic script around the 4th century. This is attested by [[Safaitic]] inscriptions (beginning in the 1st century BCE) and the many Arabic personal names in [[Nabataean]] inscriptions. From about the 2nd century BCE, a few inscriptions from [[Qaryat al-Faw]] reveal a dialect no longer considered ''proto-Arabic'', but ''pre-classical Arabic''.

Of the [[Arabian tribes that interacted with Muhammad]], the most prominent was the [[Quraysh]]. The Quraysh subclan, the [[Banu Hashim]], was the clan of Muhammad. During the early Muslim conquests and the [[Islamic Golden Age]], the political rulers of Islam were exclusively members of the Quraysh.\n\nThe Arab presence in Iran did not begin with the [[Arab conquest of Persia]] in 633 CE. For centuries, Iranian rulers had maintained contacts with Arabs outside their borders, dealt with Arab subjects and client states (such as those of Iraq and Yemen), and settled Arab tribesmen in various parts of the Iranian plateau. It follows that the \"Arab\" conquests and settlements were by no means the exclusive work of Arabs from the [[Hejaz]] and the tribesmen of inner Arabia. The Arab infiltration into Iran began before the Muslim conquests and continued as a result of the joint exertions of the civilized Arabs (ahl al-madar) as well as the desert Arabs (ahl al-wabar).<ref name=IranicaDaniel>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Daniel |first=E.

He alienated anti-slavery groups by championing and signing the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]] and enforcing the [[Fugitive Slave Act]], yet he failed to stem conflict between North and South, setting the stage for Southern [[Secession in the United States|secession]] and the [[American Civil War]].\n\nPierce was born in [[History of New Hampshire|New Hampshire]], and served in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] and the [[U.S. Senate|Senate]] until he resigned from the Senate in 1842. His private law practice was a success, and he was appointed [[United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire#U.S. Attorney for New Hampshire|New Hampshire's U.S. Attorney]] in 1845. He took part in the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] as a [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] in the Army. He was seen by Democrats as a compromise candidate uniting northern and southern interests and was nominated as the party's candidate for president on the 49th ballot at the [[1852 Democratic National Convention]]. He and running mate [[William R. King]] easily defeated the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] ticket of [[Winfield Scott]] and [[William Alexander Graham|William A. Graham]] in the [[1852 United States presidential election|1852 presidential election]].\n\nAs president, Pierce simultaneously attempted to enforce neutral standards for civil service while also satisfying the diverse elements of the Democratic Party with patronage, an effort which largely failed and turned many in his party against him. He was a [[Young America movement|Young America]] expansionist who signed the [[Gadsden Purchase]] of land from [[Mexico]] and led a failed attempt to acquire Cuba from Spain. He signed trade treaties with Britain and Japan, while his Cabinet reformed their departments and improved accountability, but these successes were overshadowed by political strife during his presidency. His popularity declined sharply in the [[New England|Northern states]] after he supported the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act, which nullified the [[Missouri Compromise]], while many whites in the South continued to support him. Passage of the act led to [[Bleeding Kansas|violent conflict]] over the expansion of slavery in the American West. Pierce's administration was further damaged when several of his diplomats issued the [[Ostend Manifesto]] calling for the annexation of Cuba, a document which was roundly criticized. He fully expected to be renominated by the Democrats in the [[1856 United States presidential election|1856 presidential election]], but was abandoned by his party and his bid failed. His reputation in the North suffered further during the [[American Civil War]] as he became a vocal critic of President [[Abraham Lincoln]].\n\nPierce was popular and outgoing, but his family life was a grim affair, with his wife [[Jane Pierce|Jane]] suffering from illness and depression for much of her life.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jeffrey W.

He was a heavy drinker for much of his life, and he died of [[cirrhosis of the liver]] in 1869.

He was a sixth-generation descendant of Thomas Pierce, who had moved to the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] from [[Norwich, Norfolk]], England in about 1634. His father [[Benjamin Pierce (governor)|Benjamin]] was a lieutenant in the [[American Revolutionary War]] who moved from [[Chelmsford, Massachusetts]] to Hillsborough after the war, purchasing {{convert|50|acre}} of land. Pierce was the fifth of eight children born to Benjamin and his second wife Anna Kendrick; his first wife Elizabeth Andrews died in childbirth, leaving a daughter. Benjamin was a prominent [[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republican]]{{refn|group=note|This was called the ''Republican'' or ''Jeffersonian Republican Party'' at the time; it soon became known as the ''[[Democratic-Republican Party]]''. Modern writers prefer this term to distinguish it from the modern-day [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].}} state legislator, farmer, and tavern-keeper. During Pierce's childhood, his father was deeply involved in state politics, while two of his older brothers fought in the [[War of 1812]]; public affairs and the military were thus a major influence in his early life.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 1\u20138.</ref>\n\nPierce's father ensured that his sons were educated, and he placed Pierce in a school at Hillsborough Center in childhood and sent him to the town school at Hancock at age 12.{{refn|group=note|The two-story school building burned some years later, and Hancock Academy was founded in 1836 to fill its place.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hurd |first1=D.

His father fed him dinner and drove him part of the distance back to school before kicking him out of the carriage and ordering him to walk the rest of the way in a thunderstorm. Pierce later cited this moment as \"the turning-point in my life\".<ref name = \"turning\">See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 10\u201315.</ref> Later that year, he transferred to [[Phillips Exeter Academy]] to prepare for college. By this time, he had built a reputation as a charming student, sometimes prone to misbehavior.<ref name = \"turning\"/>\n[[File:Nathaniel Hawthorne.jpg|thumb|Novelist [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] remained lifelong friends with Pierce.

He joined the Athenian Society, a progressive literary society, alongside [[Jonathan Cilley]] (later elected to Congress) and [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], with whom he formed lasting friendships. He was the last in his class after two years, but he worked hard to improve his grades and graduated in fifth place in 1824<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 16\u201321.</ref> in a graduating class of 14.<ref>See {{harv|Holt|2010}}, loc. 229.</ref> [[John P. Hale]] enrolled at Bowdoin in Pierce's junior year; he became a political ally of Pierce's and then his rival. Pierce organized and led an unofficial militia company called the Bowdoin Cadets during his junior year, which included Cilley and Hawthorne. The unit performed drill on campus near the president's house, until the noise caused him to demand that it halt. The students rebelled and went on strike, an event that Pierce was suspected of leading.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wallner |first=Peter A. |date=Spring 2005 |title=Franklin Pierce and Bowdoin College Associates Hawthorne and Hale |url=https://www.nhhistory.org/publications/Revealing_RelationShips_Franklin_Pierce.pdf |journal=Historical New Hampshire |publisher=New Hampshire Historical Society |page=24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150817151324/http://www.nhhistory.org/publications/Revealing_RelationShips_Franklin_Pierce.pdf |archivedate=August 17, 2015 |quote=Within the student body, Pierce's influence was widespread. Besides heading the Athenean Society, he also formed the only military company in the history of the college. \"Captain\" Pierce, in an attempt to provide recreation and instruction for his fellow students, led the Bowdoin Cadets in their daily drills on the grounds in front of the President's house. The Reverend William Allen, the college's president, objected to the noise and ordered a halt to the activity. When Pierce refused to comply with Allen's order, animosity grew between the students and the college authorities resulting in the junior class going on strike. Pierce was accused of leading the rebellion, but the college records do not acknowledge the event. Pierce's father took note of his son's role, however, and in a rare letter, admonished him about his behavior. In later years, classmates fondly recalled the strike and Pierce's key role.}}</ref> During his final year at Bowdoin, he spent several months teaching at a school in rural [[Hebron, Maine]], where he earned his first salary and his students included future Congressman [[John J.

They opposed the established [[Federalist Party|Federalists]] (and their successors, the [[National Republican Party|National Republicans]]), who were led by sitting President [[John Quincy Adams]]. The work of the New Hampshire Democratic Party came to fruition in March 1827, when their pro-Jackson nominee, Benjamin Pierce, won the support of the pro-Adams faction and was elected governor of New Hampshire essentially unopposed. While the younger Pierce had set out to build a career as an attorney, he was fully drawn into the realm of politics as the [[1828 United States presidential election|1828 presidential election]] between Adams and Jackson approached. In the state elections held in March 1828, the Adams faction withdrew their support of Benjamin Pierce, voting him out of office,{{refn|group=note|The [[governor of New Hampshire]] was then elected annually; see also [[List of Governors of New Hampshire]].}} but Franklin Pierce won his first election, as Hillsborough [[Town meeting#Traditional town meetings|town moderator]], a position to which he would be elected for six consecutive years.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 28\u201333.</ref>\n\nPierce actively campaigned in his district on behalf of Jackson, who carried both the district and the nation by large margins in the November 1828 election, even though he [[1828 United States presidential election in New Hampshire|lost New Hampshire]]. The outcome further strengthened the Democratic Party, and Pierce won his first legislative seat the following year, representing Hillsborough in the [[New Hampshire House of Representatives]]. Pierce's father, meanwhile, was elected again as governor, retiring after that term. The younger Pierce was appointed as chairman of the House Education Committee in 1829 and the Committee on Towns the following year. By 1831 the Democrats held a legislative majority, and Pierce was elected Speaker of the House. The young Speaker used his platform to oppose the expansion of banking, protect the state militia, and offer support to the national Democrats and Jackson's re-election effort. At the age of 27, he was a star of the New Hampshire Democratic Party. Though attaining early political and professional success, in his personal letters he continued to lament his bachelorhood and yearned for a life beyond Hillsborough.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 33\u201343.</ref>\n\nLike all white males in New Hampshire between the ages of 18 and 45, Pierce was a member of the [[New Hampshire Army National Guard|state militia]], and was appointed [[aide de camp]] to Governor [[Samuel Dinsmoor]] in 1831.

The Appletons were prominent Whigs, in contrast with the Pierces' Democratic affiliation. Jane Pierce was shy, devoutly religious, and pro-[[temperance movement|temperance]], encouraging Pierce to abstain from alcohol. She was somewhat gaunt, and constantly ill from [[tuberculosis]] and psychological ailments.

Jackson's second term was under way, and the House had a strong Democratic majority, whose primary focus was to prevent the [[Second Bank of the United States]] from being rechartered. The Democrats, including Pierce, defeated proposals supported by the newly formed Whig Party, and the bank's charter expired. Pierce broke from his party on occasion, opposing Democratic bills to fund [[internal improvements]] with federal money. He saw both the bank and infrastructure spending as unconstitutional, with internal improvements the responsibility of the states. Pierce's first term was fairly uneventful from a legislative standpoint, and he was easily re-elected in March 1835. When not in Washington, he attended to his law practice, and in December 1835 returned to the capital for the [[Twenty-fourth United States Congress|Twenty-fourth Congress]].<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 47\u201357.</ref>\n\nAs [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]] grew more vocal in the mid-1830s, Congress was inundated with petitions from anti-slavery groups seeking legislation to restrict slavery in the United States. From the beginning, Pierce found the abolitionists' \"agitation\" to be an annoyance, and saw federal action against slavery as an infringement on southern states' rights, even though he was morally opposed to slavery itself.<ref name=\"wallner-i-57-59\" /> He was also frustrated with the \"religious bigotry\" of abolitionists, who cast their political opponents as sinners.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 92.</ref> \"I consider slavery a social and political evil,\" Pierce said, \"and most sincerely wish that it had no existence upon the face of the earth.\"<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 71\u201372.</ref> Still, he wrote in December 1835, \"One thing must be perfectly apparent to every intelligent man. This abolition movement must be crushed or there is an end to the Union.\"<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 67.</ref>\n\nWhen Rep. [[James Henry Hammond]] of South Carolina looked to prevent anti-slavery petitions from reaching the House floor, however, Pierce sided with the abolitionists' right to petition. Nevertheless, Pierce supported what came to be known as the [[21st Rule|gag rule]], which allowed for petitions to be received, but not read or considered. This passed the House in 1836.<ref name=\"wallner-i-57-59\">See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 57\u201359.</ref> He was attacked by the New Hampshire anti-slavery ''Herald of Freedom'' as a \"[[doughface]]\", which had the dual meaning of \"craven-spirited man\" and \"northerner with southern sympathies\".<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 59\u201361.</ref> Pierce had stated that not one in 500 New Hampshirites were abolitionists; the ''Herald of Freedom'' article added up the number of signatures on petitions from that state, divided by the number of residents according to the 1830 census, and suggested the actual number was one-in-33. Pierce was outraged when South Carolina Senator [[John C. Calhoun]] read the article on the Senate floor as \"proof\" that New Hampshire was a hotbed of abolitionism. Calhoun apologized after Pierce replied to him in a speech which stated that most signatories were women and children, who could not vote, which therefore cast doubt on the one-in-33 figure.<ref>See {{harv|Holt|2010}}, loc. 362\u201375.</ref>\n\n===U.S. Senate===\n[[File:Franklin Pierce by Southworth & Hawes c1852.png|thumb|right|Pierce in 1852]]\nThe resignation in May 1836 of Senator Isaac Hill, who had been elected governor of New Hampshire, left a short-term opening to be filled by the state legislature, and with Hill's term as senator due to expire in March 1837, the legislature also had to fill the six-year term to follow. Pierce's candidacy for the Senate was championed by state Representative John P. Hale, a fellow Athenian at Bowdoin. After much debate, the legislature chose [[John Page (New Hampshire)|John Page]] to fill the rest of Hill's term. In December 1836, Pierce was elected to the full term, to commence in March 1837, and at age 32, was at the time one of the youngest members in Senate history. The election came at a difficult time for Pierce, as his father, sister, and brother were all seriously ill, while his wife also continued to suffer from chronic poor health. As senator, he was able to help his old friend Nathaniel Hawthorne, who often struggled financially, procuring for him a [[sinecure]] as measurer of coal and salt at the Boston Customs House that allowed the author time to continue writing.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 64\u201369.</ref>\n\nPierce voted the party line on most issues and was an able senator, but not an eminent one; he was overshadowed by the [[Great Triumvirate]] of Calhoun, [[Henry Clay]], and [[Daniel Webster]], who dominated the Senate.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 68, 91\u201392.</ref> Pierce entered the Senate at a time of economic crisis, as the [[Panic of 1837]] had begun. He considered the depression a result of the banking system's rapid growth, amidst \"the extravagance of overtrading and the wilderness of speculation\".<ref name = \"w6972\" /> So that federal money would not support speculative bank loans, he supported newly elected Democratic president [[Martin Van Buren]] and his plan to create an [[Independent Treasury|independent treasury]], a proposal which split the Democratic Party. Debate over slavery continued in Congress, and abolitionists proposed its end in the District of Columbia, where Congress had jurisdiction. Pierce supported a resolution by Calhoun against this proposal, which Pierce considered a dangerous stepping stone to nationwide emancipation.<ref name = \"w6972\">See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 69\u201372.</ref> Meanwhile, the Whigs were growing in congressional strength, which would leave Pierce's party with only a small majority by the end of the decade.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 80.</ref>\n\nOne topic of particular importance to Pierce was the military. He challenged a bill which would expand the ranks of the Army's staff officers in Washington without any apparent benefit to line officers at posts in the rest of the country. He took an interest in military pensions, seeing abundant fraud within the system, and was named chairman of the Senate Committee on Military Pensions in the [[Twenty-sixth United States Congress|Twenty-sixth Congress]] (1839\u20131841). In that capacity, he urged the modernization and expansion of the Army, with a focus on militias and mobility rather than on coastal fortifications, which he considered outdated.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 78\u201384.</ref>\n\nPierce campaigned vigorously throughout his home state for Van Buren's re-election in the [[1840 United States presidential election|1840 presidential election]]. The incumbent carried New Hampshire but lost the national vote to [[William Henry Harrison]], the military hero, whose Whigs took a majority of seats in the [[Twenty-seventh United States Congress|Twenty-seventh Congress]]. Harrison died after a month in office, and Vice President [[John Tyler]] succeeded him. Pierce and the Democrats were quick to challenge the new administration, questioning the removal of federal officeholders, and opposing Whig plans for a national bank. In December 1841 Pierce decided to resign from Congress, something he had been planning for some time.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 84\u201390.</ref> New Hampshire Democrats insisted that their state's U. S. senators be limited to one six-year term, so he had little likelihood of re-election. Also, he was frustrated at being a member of the legislative minority and wished to devote his time to his family and law practice.<ref>See {{harv|Holt|2010}}, loc. 419.</ref> His last actions in the Senate in February 1842 were to oppose a bill distributing federal funds to the states \u2013 believing that the money should go to the military instead \u2013 and to challenge the Whigs to reveal the results of their investigation of the [[Collector of the Port of New York|New York Customs House]], where the Whigs had probed for Democratic corruption for nearly a year but had issued no findings.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 91\u201392.</ref>\n\n==Party leader==\n\n===Lawyer and politician===\n[[File:Piercemanse.JPG|thumb|The [[Concord, New Hampshire]] house where Pierce lived from 1842 to 1848 is now known as the [[Pierce Manse]].

The move to Concord had given him more opportunities for cases, and allowed Jane Pierce a more robust community life.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 79.</ref> Jane had remained in Concord with her young son Frank and her newborn Benjamin for the latter part of Pierce's senate term, and this separation had taken a toll on the family. Pierce, meanwhile, had begun a demanding but lucrative law partnership with [[Asa Fowler]] during congressional recesses.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 86.</ref> Pierce returned to Concord in early 1842, and his reputation as a lawyer continued to flourish. Known for his gracious personality, eloquence, and excellent memory, Pierce attracted large audiences in court. He would often represent poor people for little or no compensation.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 98\u2013101.</ref>\n\nPierce remained involved in the state Democratic Party, which was split by several issues. Governor Hill, who represented the commercial, urban wing of the party, advocated the use of government charters to support corporations, granting them privileges such as limited liability and eminent domain for building railroads. The radical \"[[Locofocos|locofoco]]\" wing of his party represented farmers and other rural voters, who sought an expansion of social programs and labor regulations and a restriction on corporate privilege. The state's political culture grew less tolerant of banks and corporations after the Panic of 1837, and Hill was voted out of office. Pierce was closer to the radicals philosophically, and reluctantly agreed to represent Hill's adversary in a legal dispute regarding ownership of a newspaper\u2014Hill lost, and founded his own paper, of which Pierce was a frequent target.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 93\u201395.</ref>\n\nIn June 1842 Pierce was named chairman of the State Democratic Committee, and in the following year's state election he helped the radical wing take over the state legislature. The party remained divided on several issues, including railroad development and the [[temperance movement]], and Pierce took a leading role in helping the state legislature settle their differences. His priorities were \"order, moderation, compromise, and party unity\", which he tried to place ahead of his personal views on political issues.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 103\u201310.</ref> As he would as president, Pierce valued Democratic Party unity highly, and saw the opposition to slavery as a threat to that.<ref>See {{harv|Holt|2010}}, loc. 431.</ref>\n\nDemocratic [[James K. Polk]]'s [[dark horse]] victory in the [[1844 United States presidential election|1844 presidential election]] was welcome news to Pierce, who had befriended the former [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] while both served in Congress. Pierce had campaigned heavily for Polk during the election, and in turn Polk appointed him as [[United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire#U.S. Attorney for New Hampshire|United States Attorney for New Hampshire]].<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 131\u201332.</ref> Polk's most prominent cause was the [[annexation of Texas]], an issue which caused a dramatic split between Pierce and his former ally Hale, now a U.S. Representative. Hale was so impassioned against adding a new slave state that he wrote a public letter to his constituents outlining his opposition to the measure.<ref>See {{harv|Wadleigh|1913}}, p. 249: \"Jan.7.-Hon. John P. Hale's letter to his constituents against the annexation of Texas, published\".</ref> Pierce responded by re-assembling the state Democratic convention to revoke Hale's nomination for another term in Congress.<ref>See {{harv|Wadleigh|1913}}, p. 249: \"John P. Hale, who had been nominated for re-election to Congress by the Democratic party, was at this election dropped from the ticket, and John Woodbury substituted, in consequence of Mr. Hale's refusal to go with the party in voting for the annexation of Texas. A portion of the party, consisting of those who approved of his opposition to the extension of slavery, voted for him, and succeeded in defeating his opponent, leaving a vacancy in the delegation\".</ref> The political firestorm led to Pierce severing ties with his longtime friend, and with his law partner Fowler, who was a Hale supporter.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 111\u201322.</ref> Hale refused to withdraw, and as a majority vote was needed for election in New Hampshire, the party split led to deadlock and a vacant House seat. Eventually, the Whigs and Hale's [[Independent Democrat]]s took control of the legislature, elected Whig [[Anthony Colby]] as governor and sent Hale to the Senate, much to Pierce's anger.<ref>See {{harv|Holt|2010}}, loc. 447.</ref>\n\n===Mexican\u2013American War===\n[[File:Franklin Pierce - 1852.jpg|thumb|upright|Pierce in his brigadier general's uniform]]\nActive military service was a long-held dream for Pierce, who had admired his father's and brothers' service in his youth, particularly his older brother [[Benjamin Kendrick Pierce|Benjamin]]'s, as well as that of [[John McNeil Jr.]], husband of Pierce's older half-sister Elizabeth. As a legislator, he was a passionate advocate for volunteer militias. As a militia officer himself, he had experience mustering and drilling bodies of troops. When Congress declared war against Mexico in May 1846, Pierce immediately volunteered to join, although no New England regiment yet existed. His hope to fight in the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] was one reason he refused an offer to become Polk's [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]]. General [[Zachary Taylor]]'s advance slowed in northern Mexico, and General [[Winfield Scott]] proposed capturing the port of [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Vera Cruz]] and driving overland to Mexico City. Congress passed a bill authorizing the creation of ten regiments, and Pierce was appointed commander and colonel of the [[9th Infantry Regiment (United States)|9th Infantry Regiment]] in February 1847, with Truman B. Ransom as [[Lieutenant Colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] and second-in-command.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 131\u201335.</ref>\n\n[[File:FrankP-mounted.jpg|thumb|left|Pierce's brief term as a [[general officer|general]] in the Mexican\u2013American War boosted his public image.<ref name=\"war-reception\" />|alt=Illustration of Franklin Pierce as a general, riding a horse]]\nOn March 3, 1847, Pierce was promoted to [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]], and took command of a [[brigade]] of reinforcements for General Scott's army, with Ransom succeeding to command of the regiment. Needing time to assemble his brigade, Pierce reached the already-seized port of Vera Cruz in late June, where he prepared a march of 2,500 men accompanying supplies for Scott. The three-week journey inland was perilous, and the men fought off several attacks before joining with Scott's army in early August, in time for the [[Battle of Contreras]].<ref>See {{harv|Holt|2010}}, loc. 490.</ref> The battle was disastrous for Pierce: his horse was suddenly startled during a charge, knocking him groin-first against his saddle. The horse then tripped into a crevice and fell, pinning Pierce underneath and debilitating his knee.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 144\u201347.</ref> The incident made it look like he had fainted, causing one soldier to call for someone else to take command, \"General Pierce is a damned coward.\"<ref name = \"h505\">See {{harv|Holt|2010}}, loc. 505.</ref> Pierce returned for the following day's action, but re-injured his knee, forcing him to hobble after his men; by the time he caught up, the battle was mostly won.<ref name = h505 />\n\nAs the [[Battle of Churubusco]] approached, Scott ordered Pierce to the rear to convalesce. He responded, \"For God's sake, General, this is the last great battle, and I must lead my brigade.\" Scott yielded, and Pierce entered the fight tied to his saddle, but the pain in his leg became so great that he passed out on the field. The Americans won the battle and Pierce helped negotiate an armistice. He then returned to command and led his brigade throughout the rest of the campaign, eventually taking part in the [[Battle for Mexico City|capture of Mexico City]] in mid-September, although his brigade was held in reserve for much of the battle.<ref name = w147plus /> For much of the Mexico City battle, he was in the sick tent, plagued with acute diarrhea.<ref name = h505 /> Pierce remained in command of his brigade during the three-month occupation of the city; while frustrated with the stalling of peace negotiations, he also tried to distance himself from the constant conflict between Scott and the other generals.<ref name = w147plus>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 147\u201354.</ref>\n\nPierce was finally allowed to return to Concord in late December 1847. He was given a hero's welcome in his home state, and submitted his resignation from the Army, which was approved on March 20, 1848. His military exploits elevated his popularity in New Hampshire, but his injuries and subsequent troubles in battle led to accusations of cowardice which would long shadow him. He had demonstrated competence as a general, especially in the initial march from Vera Cruz, but his short tenure and his injury left little for historians to judge his ability as a military commander.<ref name=\"war-reception\">See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 154\u2013157.</ref>\n\n[[Ulysses S. Grant]], who had the opportunity to observe Pierce firsthand during the war, countered the allegations of cowardice in his memoirs, written several years after Pierce's death: \"Whatever General Pierce's qualifications may have been for the Presidency, he was a gentleman and a man of courage.

His role as a party leader, however, continued to take up most of his attention. He continued to wrangle with Senator Hale, who was anti-slavery and had opposed the war, stances that Pierce regarded as needless agitation.<ref name=\"leadership\">See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 157\u201361.</ref>\n\nThe large [[Mexican Cession]] of land divided the United States politically, with many in the North insisting that slavery not be allowed there (and offering the [[Wilmot Proviso]] to ensure it), while others wanted slavery barred north of the [[Missouri Compromise]] line of [[Parallel 36\u00b030\u2032 north|36\u00b030\u2032 N]]. Both proposals were anathema to many Southerners, and the controversy split the Democrats. At the [[1848 Democratic National Convention]], the majority nominated former Michigan senator [[Lewis Cass]] for president, while a minority broke off to become the [[Free Soil Party]], backing former president Van Buren. The Whigs chose General [[Zachary Taylor]], a Louisianan, whose views on most political issues were unknown. Despite his past support for Van Buren, Pierce supported Cass, turning down the quiet offer of second place on the Free Soil [[ticket (politics)|ticket]], and was so effective that Taylor, who was [[1848 United States presidential election|elected president]], was held in New Hampshire to his lowest percentage in any state.<ref>See {{harv|Holt|2010}}, p. 549\u201365.</ref>\n\nSenator Henry Clay, a Whig, hoped to put the slavery question to rest with a set of proposals that became known as the [[Compromise of 1850]]. These would give victories to North and South, and gained the support of his fellow Whig, Webster. With the bill stalled in the Senate, Illinois Senator [[Stephen A.

It was widely expected that the [[1852 Democratic National Convention]] would result in deadlock, with no major candidate able to win the necessary two-thirds majority. New Hampshire Democrats, including Pierce, supported his old teacher, Levi Woodbury, by then an [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Justice of the Supreme Court]], as a compromise candidate, but Woodbury's death in September 1851 opened up an opportunity for Pierce's allies to present him as a potential dark horse in the mold of Polk. New Hampshire Democrats felt that, as the state in which their party had most consistently gained Democratic majorities, they should supply the presidential candidate. Other possible standard-bearers included Douglas, Cass, [[William Marcy]] of New York, [[James Buchanan]] of Pennsylvania, [[Sam Houston]] of Texas, and [[Thomas Hart Benton (politician)|Thomas Hart Benton]] of Missouri.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 181\u201384.</ref><ref>See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 23\u201329.</ref>\n\nDespite home state support, Pierce faced obstacles to his nomination, since he had been out of office for a decade, and also lacked the front-runners' national reputation. He publicly declared that such a nomination would be \"utterly repugnant to my tastes and wishes\", but given the desire of New Hampshire Democrats to see one of their own elected, he knew his future influence depended on his availability to run.<ref name =w184plus /> Thus, he quietly allowed his supporters to lobby for him, with the understanding that his name would not be entered at the convention unless it was clear none of the front-runners could win. To broaden his potential base of southern support as the convention approached, he wrote letters reiterating his support for the Compromise of 1850, including the controversial [[Fugitive Slave Act]].<ref name =w184plus>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 184\u201397.</ref><ref>See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 32\u201333.</ref>\n\nThe convention assembled on June 1 in [[Baltimore]], Maryland, and the deadlock occurred as expected. On the first ballot of the 288 delegates, held on June 3, Cass claimed 116, Buchanan 93, and the rest were scattered, without a single vote for Pierce. The next 34 ballots passed with no winner even close, and still no votes for Pierce. The Buchanan team then had their delegates vote for minor candidates, including Pierce, to demonstrate Buchanan's inevitability, and unite the convention behind him. This novel tactic backfired after several ballots as Virginia, New Hampshire, and Maine switched to Pierce; the remaining Buchanan forces began to break for Marcy, and Pierce was soon in third place. After the 48th ballot, North Carolina Congressman [[James C. Dobbin]] delivered an unexpected and passionate endorsement of Pierce, sparking a wave of support for the dark horse candidate. On the 49th ballot, Pierce received all but six of the votes, and thus gained the Democratic nomination for president. Delegates selected Alabama Senator [[William R. King]], a Buchanan supporter, as Pierce's [[running mate]], and adopted a [[party platform]] that rejected further \"agitation\" over the slavery issue and supported the Compromise of 1850.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 197\u2013202</ref><ref>See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 33\u201334.</ref>\n\nWhen word reached New Hampshire of the result, Pierce found it difficult to believe, and his wife fainted. Their son Benjamin wrote to his mother hoping that Franklin's candidacy would not be successful, as he knew she would not like to live in Washington.<ref>See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 34.</ref>\n\n[[File:Scott vs Pierce campaign.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.6|This anti-Pierce political cartoon depicts him as weak and cowardly|alt=Political cartoon]]\nThe Whig candidate was General Scott, Pierce's commander in Mexico; his running mate was [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] [[William Alexander Graham|William A. Graham]]. The Whigs could not unify their factions as the Democrats had, and the convention adopted a platform almost indistinguishable from that of the Democrats, including support of the Compromise of 1850. This incited the Free Soilers to field their own candidate, Senator Hale of New Hampshire, at the expense of the Whigs. The lack of political differences reduced the campaign to a bitter personality contest and helped to dampen [[voter turnout]] to its lowest level since [[U.S. presidential election, 1836|1836]]; according to biographer Peter A. Wallner, it was \"one of the least exciting campaigns in presidential history\".<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 210\u201313</ref><ref>See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 36\u201338.</ref> Scott was harmed by the lack of enthusiasm of anti-slavery northern Whigs for him and the platform; ''[[New-York Tribune]]'' editor [[Horace Greeley]] summed up the attitude of many when he said of the Whig platform, \"we defy it, execrate it, spit upon it\".<ref>See {{harv|Holt|2010}}, loc. 724.</ref>\n\n[[File:ElectoralCollege1852.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|right|Electoral map of the [[1852 United States presidential election|1852 presidential election]]|alt=Map]]\nPierce kept quiet so as not to upset his party's delicate unity, and allowed his allies to run the campaign.

Weeks after his election, on January 6, 1853, the President-elect's family had been traveling from Boston by train when their car derailed and rolled down an [[embankment (transportation)|embankment]] near [[Andover, Massachusetts]]. Both Franklin and Jane Pierce survived, but in the wreckage found their only remaining son, 11-year-old Benjamin, crushed to death, his body nearly decapitated. Pierce was not able to hide the gruesome sight from his wife. They both suffered severe depression afterward, which likely affected Pierce's performance as president.<ref name=\"benny\">See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 241\u201349.</ref><ref>See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 43\u201344.</ref> Jane Pierce wondered if the train accident was divine punishment for her husband's pursuit and acceptance of high office.

Pierce, then the youngest man to be elected president, chose to [[Affirmation in law|affirm]] his oath of office on a law book rather than swear it on a Bible, as all his predecessors except John Quincy Adams had done. He was the first president to deliver his [[Inauguration Day|inaugural address]] from memory.<ref>{{cite book |last= Hurja |first= Emil |date=1933|title=History of Presidential Inaugurations |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=KnY_AAAAIAAJ|publisher=New York Democrat |page= 49}}</ref> In the address he hailed an era of peace and prosperity at home and urged a vigorous assertion of U.S. interests in its foreign relations, including the \"eminently important\" acquisition of new territories. \"The policy of my Administration\", said the new president, \"will not be deterred by any timid forebodings of evil from expansion.\" Avoiding the word \"slavery\", he emphasized his desire to put the \"important subject\" to rest and maintain a peaceful union. He alluded to his own personal tragedy, telling the crowd, \"You have summoned me in my weakness, you must sustain me by your strength.\"<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 249\u201355.</ref>\n\n===Administration and political strife===\n{{See also|List of federal judges appointed by Franklin Pierce}}\n{{CSS image crop|Image = PIERCE, Franklin-President (BEP engraved portrait).jpg |bSize = 325|cWidth = 230|cHeight = 270|oTop = 50|oLeft = 45|Location = right|Description = [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing|BEP]]-engraved portrait of Pierce as president}}\n\nIn his [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]] appointments, Pierce sought to unite a party that was squabbling over the fruits of victory. Most in the party had not originally supported him for the nomination, and some had allied with the Free Soil party to gain victory in local elections. Pierce decided to allow each of the party's factions some appointments, even those that had not supported the Compromise of 1850.<ref>See {{harv|Holt|2010}}, loc. 767.</ref>\n\nAll of Pierce's cabinet nominations were unanimously and immediately confirmed by the Senate.<ref name =\"wall5plus\" /> Pierce spent the first few weeks of his term sorting through hundreds of lower-level federal positions to be filled. This was a chore, as he sought to represent all factions of the party, and could fully satisfy none of them. Partisans found themselves unable to secure positions for their friends, which put the Democratic Party on edge and fueled bitterness between factions. Before long, northern newspapers accused Pierce of filling his government with pro-slavery secessionists, while southern newspapers accused him of abolitionism.<ref name =\"wall5plus\">See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 5\u201324.</ref>\n\nFactionalism between the pro- and anti-administration Democrats ramped up quickly, especially within the New York Democratic Party. The more conservative Hardshell Democrats or \"Hards\" of New York were deeply skeptical of the Pierce administration, which was associated with Marcy (who became Secretary of State) and the more moderate New York faction, the Softshell Democrats or \"Softs\".<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 15\u201318, and throughout.</ref>\n\n[[File:William R.

By the start of 1853, King was severely ill with tuberculosis, and went to Cuba to recuperate. His condition deteriorated, and Congress passed a special law, allowing him to be sworn in before the American consul in Havana on March 24. Wanting to die at home, he returned to his plantation in Alabama on April 17 and died the next day. The office of vice president remained vacant for the remainder of Pierce's term, as the Constitution then had no provision for filling the vacancy. This extended vacancy meant that for nearly the entirety of Pierce's presidency the [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|Senate President pro tempore]], initially [[David Atchison]] of Missouri, was next in line to the presidency.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 21\u201322.</ref>\n\nPierce sought to run a more efficient and accountable government than his predecessors.<ref name=\"wallner-20\" /> His Cabinet members implemented an early system of [[United States federal civil service|civil service]] examinations which was a forerunner to the [[Pendleton Act]] passed three decades later, which mandated that most positions in the U.S. government should be awarded on the basis of merit, not patronage.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 35\u201336.</ref> The [[United States Department of the Interior|Interior Department]] was reformed by Secretary [[Robert McClelland (American politician)|Robert McClelland]], who systematized its operations, expanded the use of paper records, and pursued fraud.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 36\u201339.</ref> Another of Pierce's reforms was to expand the role of the U.S. attorney general in appointing federal judges and attorneys, which was an important step in the eventual development of the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]].<ref name=\"wallner-20\">See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 20.</ref> There was a vacancy on the Supreme Court\u2014Fillmore, having failed to get Senate confirmation for his nominees, had offered it to newly elected Louisiana Senator [[Judah P.

Marcy]] leading the charge as [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]]. Marcy sought to present to the world a distinctively American, republican image. He issued a circular recommending that U.S. diplomats wear \"the simple dress of an American citizen\" instead of the elaborate [[diplomatic uniform]]s worn in the courts of Europe, and that they only hire American citizens to work in consulates.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 25\u201332.</ref><ref>See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 128.</ref> Marcy received international praise for his 73-page letter defending Austrian refugee [[Martin Koszta]], who had been captured abroad in mid-1853 by the Austrian government despite his intention to become a U.S. citizen.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 61\u201363.</ref><ref>See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 128\u201329.</ref>\n\nDavis, an advocate of a southern transcontinental route, persuaded Pierce to send rail magnate [[James Gadsden]] to Mexico to buy land for a potential railroad. Gadsden was also charged with re-negotiating the provisions of the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] which required the U.S. to prevent Native American raids into Mexico from New Mexico Territory. Gadsden negotiated a treaty with Mexican President [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]] in December 1853, purchasing a large swath of land to America's southwest. Negotiations were nearly derailed by [[William Walker (filibuster)|William Walker]]'s [[filibuster (military)|unauthorized expedition]] into Mexico, and so a clause was included charging the U.S. with combating future such attempts.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 75\u201381.</ref><ref>See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 129\u201333.</ref> Congress reduced the [[Gadsden Purchase]] to the region now comprising southern [[Arizona]] and part of southern New Mexico; the price was cut from $15&nbsp;million to $10&nbsp;million.

Marcy completed a [[trade agreement|trade reciprocity agreement]] with British minister to Washington, [[Sir John Crampton, 2nd Baronet|John Crampton]], which reduced the need for aggressive coastline enforcement. Buchanan was sent as minister to London to pressure the British government, which was slow to support a new treaty. A favorable reciprocity treaty was ratified in August 1854, which Pierce saw as a first step towards the American annexation of Canada.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 27\u201330, 63\u201366, 125\u201326</ref><ref>See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 133.</ref> While the administration negotiated with Britain over the Canada\u2013US border, U.S. interests were also threatened in Central America, where the [[Clayton\u2013Bulwer Treaty]] of 1850 had failed to keep Great Britain from expanding its influence.

To the President's surprise, the British did not expel Buchanan in retaliation. In his December 1855 [[State of the Union|message to Congress]] Pierce had set forth the American case that Britain had violated the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty. The British, according to Buchanan, were impressed by the message and were rethinking their policy. Nevertheless, Buchanan was not successful in getting the British to renounce their Central American possessions. The Canadian treaty was ratified by Congress, the British Parliament, and by the colonial legislatures in Canada.<ref>See {{harv|Holt|2010}}, loc. 902\u201317.</ref>\n\nPierce's administration aroused sectional apprehensions when three U.S. diplomats in Europe drafted a proposal to the president to purchase [[Cuba]] from Spain for $120&nbsp;million (USD), and justify the \"wresting\" of it from Spain if the offer were refused. The publication of the [[Ostend Manifesto]], which had been drawn up at the insistence of Secretary of State Marcy, provoked the scorn of northerners who viewed it as an attempt to annex a slave-holding possession to bolster Southern interests. It helped discredit the expansionist policy of [[Manifest Destiny]] the Democratic Party had often supported.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 131\u201357.</ref><ref>See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 149\u2013155.</ref>\n\nPierce favored expansion and a substantial reorganization of the military.

[[organized territory|Organizing]] the largely unsettled [[Nebraska Territory]], which stretched from [[Missouri]] to the [[Rocky Mountains]], and from Texas north to what is now the Canada\u2013US border, was a crucial part of Douglas's plans for western expansion. He wanted a transcontinental railroad with a link from [[Chicago]] to California, through the vast western territory. Organizing the territory was necessary for settlement as the land would not be surveyed nor put up for sale until a territorial government was authorized. Those from slave states had never been content with western limits on slavery, and felt it should be able to expand into territories procured with blood and treasure that had come, in part, from the South. Douglas and his allies planned to organize the territory and let local settlers [[Popular sovereignty in the United States|decide whether to allow slavery]]. This would repeal the Missouri Compromise of 1820, as most of it was north of the 36\u00b030\u2032 N line the Missouri Compromise deemed \"free\". The territory would be split into a northern part, Nebraska, and a southern part, [[Kansas Territory|Kansas]], and the expectation was that Kansas would allow slavery and Nebraska would not.<ref name=\"kansas\">See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 90\u2013102, 119\u201322.</ref><ref name =\"kansas 2\">See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 88\u2013100.</ref><ref name = \"kansas 3\">See {{harv|Holt|2010}}, loc. 1097\u20131240.</ref> In the view of pro-slavery [[U.S. Southern states|Southern]] politicians, the Compromise of 1850 had already annulled the Missouri Compromise by admitting the state of [[California]], including territory south of the compromise line, as a free state.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Davis |first1=Jefferson |title=The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government |date=1881 |isbn=0-306-80418-2 |page=25|title-link=The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government }}</ref>\n\nPierce had wanted to organize the Nebraska Territory without explicitly addressing the matter of slavery, but Douglas could not get enough southern support to accomplish this.<ref>See {{harv|Etchison|2004}}, p. 14.</ref> Pierce was skeptical of the bill, knowing it would result in bitter opposition from the North. Douglas and Davis convinced him to support the bill regardless. It was tenaciously opposed by northerners such as Ohio Senator [[Salmon P. Chase]] and Massachusetts's [[Charles Sumner]], who rallied public sentiment in the North against the bill. Northerners had been suspicious of the Gadsden Purchase, moves towards Cuba annexation, and the influence of slaveholding Cabinet members such as Davis, and saw the Nebraska bill as part of a pattern of southern aggression. The result was a political firestorm that did great damage to Pierce's presidency.<ref name = \"kansas\" /><ref name = \"kansas 2\"/><ref name=\"kansas 3\"/>\n \nPierce and his administration used threats and promises to keep most Democrats on board in favor of the bill. The Whigs split along sectional lines; the conflict destroyed them as a national party. The Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act was passed in May 1854 and ultimately defined the Pierce presidency. The political turmoil that followed the passage saw the short-term rise of the nativist and anti-Catholic American Party, often called the [[Know Nothing]]s, and the founding of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].<ref name=\"kansas\" /><ref name=\"kansas 2\"/><ref name=\"kansas 3\"/>\n\n[[File:Forcing Slavery Freesoilers Throats.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|Northerners resented Pierce's attempted expansion of slavery through Kansas\u2013Nebraska and Cuba.<ref name=\"resentment\" /><ref name=\"resentment 2\"/> In this 1856 cartoon, a [[Free Soil Party|Free Soiler]] is held down by Pierce, Buchanan, and Cass while Douglas shoves \"Slavery\" (depicted as a black man) down his throat.|alt=Political cartoon]]\n\nEven as the act was being debated, settlers on both sides of the slavery issue poured into the territories so as to secure the outcome they wanted in the voting. The passage of the act resulted in so much violence between groups that the territory became known as [[Bleeding Kansas]]. Thousands of pro-slavery [[Border Ruffians]] came across from Missouri to vote in the territorial elections although they were not resident in Kansas, giving that element the victory. Pierce supported the outcome despite the irregularities. When [[Free-Stater (Kansas)|Free-Staters]] set up a shadow government, and drafted the [[Topeka Constitution]], Pierce called their work an act of rebellion. The president continued to recognize the pro-slavery legislature, which was dominated by Democrats, even after a Congressional investigative committee found its election to have been illegitimate. He dispatched federal troops to break up a meeting of the [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]] government.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 195\u2013209.</ref><ref>See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 111\u2013120.</ref>\n\nPassage of the act coincided with the seizure of escaped slave [[Anthony Burns]] in Boston. Northerners rallied in support of Burns, but Pierce was determined to follow the Fugitive Slave Act to the letter, and dispatched federal troops to enforce Burns's return to his Virginia owner despite furious crowds.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 122\u201325.</ref><ref>See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 107\u2013109.</ref>\n\nThe midterm congressional elections of 1854 and 1855 were devastating to the Democrats (as well as to the Whig Party, which was on its last legs). The Democrats lost almost every state outside the South. The administration's opponents in the North worked together to return opposition members to Congress, though only a few northern Whigs gained election. In Pierce's New Hampshire, hitherto loyal to the Democratic Party, the Know-Nothings elected the governor, all three representatives, dominated the legislature, and returned John P. Hale to the Senate. Anti-immigrant fervor brought the Know-Nothings their highest numbers to that point, and some northerners were elected under the auspices of the new Republican Party.<ref name=\"resentment\">See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 158\u201367.</ref><ref name=\"resentment 2\">See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 99\u2013100.</ref>\n\n===1856 election===\n{{Main|1856 Democratic National Convention}}\n\n[[File:Southern Chivalry.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Partisan violence spilled into Congress in May 1856 when Free Soil Senator [[Charles Sumner]] was [[caning of Charles Sumner|assaulted with a walking cane]] by Democratic Rep.

In reality his chances of winning the nomination were slim, let alone re-election. The administration was widely disliked in the North for its position on the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act, and Democratic leaders were aware of Pierce's electoral vulnerability. Nevertheless, his supporters began to plan for an alliance with Douglas to deny James Buchanan the nomination. Buchanan had solid political connections and had been safely overseas through most of Pierce's term, leaving him untainted by the Kansas debacle.<ref name=\"1856-convention\">See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 266\u201370.</ref><ref name=\"1856-convention 2\">See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 157\u201367.</ref><ref name=\"1856-convention 3\">See {{harv|Holt|2010}}, loc. 1515\u201358.</ref>\n\nWhen balloting began on June 5 at the convention in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], Pierce expected a plurality, if not the required two-thirds majority. On the first ballot, he received only 122 votes, many of them from the South, to Buchanan's 135, with Douglas and Cass receiving the rest. By the following morning fourteen ballots had been completed, but none of the three main candidates were able to get two-thirds of the vote. Pierce, whose support had been slowly declining as the ballots passed, directed his supporters to break for Douglas, withdrawing his name in a last-ditch effort to defeat Buchanan. Douglas, only 43 years of age, believed that he could be nominated in 1860 if he let the older Buchanan win this time, and received assurances from Buchanan's managers that this would be the case. After two more deadlocked ballots, Douglas's managers withdrew his name, leaving Buchanan as the clear winner. To soften the blow to Pierce, the convention issued a resolution of \"unqualified approbation\" in praise of his administration and selected his ally, former Kentucky Representative [[John C. Breckinridge]], as the vice-presidential nominee.<ref name=\"1856-convention\" /><ref name=\"1856-convention 2\" /><ref name=\"1856-convention 3\" /> This loss marked the only time in U.S. history that an elected president who was an active candidate for reelection was not nominated for a second term.{{refn|group=note|Pierce was the only president who had been elected as president to not be renominated by their party for a second term.

In his final message to Congress, delivered in December 1856, he vigorously attacked Republicans and abolitionists. He took the opportunity to defend his record on fiscal policy, and on achieving peaceful relations with other nations.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 292\u2013296.</ref><ref>See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 177\u2013179.</ref> In the final days of the Pierce administration, Congress passed bills to increase the pay of army officers and to build new naval vessels, also expanding the number of seamen enlisted.

The Pierces eventually moved to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, where Pierce had begun to speculate in property. Seeking warmer weather, he and Jane spent the next three years traveling, beginning with a stay in [[Madeira]] and followed by tours of Europe and the [[Bahamas]].<ref name = \"postpres\" /> In Rome, he visited Nathaniel Hawthorne; the two men spent much time together and the author found the retired president as buoyant as ever.<ref>See {{harv|Boulard|2006}}, p. 55\u201356.</ref>\n\nPierce never lost sight of politics during his travels, commenting regularly on the nation's growing sectional conflict. He insisted that northern abolitionists stand down to avoid a southern secession, writing that the bloodshed of a civil war would \"not be along Mason and Dixon's line merely\", but \"within our own borders in our own streets\".<ref name = \"postpres\" /> He also criticized New England Protestant ministers, who largely supported abolition and Republican candidates, for their \"heresy and treason\".<ref name=\"postpres\">See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 309\u2013327.</ref> The rise of the Republican Party forced the Democrats to defend Pierce; during [[Lincoln-Douglas debates|his debates]] with Republican Senate candidate [[Abraham Lincoln]] in 1858, Douglas called the former president \"a man of integrity and honor\".<ref>See {{harv|Boulard|2006}}, p. 65\u201366.</ref>\n\nAs the Democratic Convention of 1860 approached, some asked Pierce to run as a compromise candidate that could unite the fractured party, but Pierce refused. As Douglas struggled to attract southern support, Pierce backed Cushing and then Breckinridge as potential alternatives, but his priority was a united Democratic Party. The split Democrats were soundly [[1860 United States presidential election|defeated]] for the presidency by the Republican candidate, Lincoln. In the months between Lincoln's election, and his inauguration on March 4, 1861, Pierce looked on as several southern states began plans to secede. He was asked by Justice Campbell to travel to Alabama and address that state's secession convention. Due to illness he declined, but sent a letter appealing to the people of Alabama to remain in the Union, and give the North time to repeal laws against southern interests and to find common ground.<ref name = \"secede\">See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 327\u2013338.</ref>\n\n===Civil War===\nAfter efforts to prevent the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] ended with the firing on [[Fort Sumter]], Northern Democrats, including Douglas, endorsed Lincoln's plan to bring the Southern states back into the fold by force. Pierce wanted to avoid war at all costs, and wrote to Van Buren, proposing an assembly of former U.S. presidents to resolve the issue, but this suggestion was not acted on. \"I will never justify, sustain or in any way or to any extent uphold this cruel, heartless, aimless, unnecessary war,\" Pierce wrote to his wife.<ref name = \"secede\" /> Pierce publicly opposed President Lincoln's order suspending the writ of [[habeas corpus in the United States|''habeas corpus'']], arguing that even in a time of war, the country should not abandon its protection of civil liberties. This stand won him admirers with the emerging [[Copperheads (politics)|Northern Peace Democrats]], but others saw the stand as further evidence of Pierce's southern bias.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 337\u2013343.</ref>\n\nIn September 1861, Pierce traveled to Michigan, visiting his former Interior Secretary, McClelland, former senator Cass, and others. A Detroit bookseller, J. A. Roys, sent a letter to Lincoln's Secretary of State, [[William H. Seward]], accusing the former president of meeting with disloyal people, and saying he had heard there was a plot to overthrow the government and establish Pierce as president. Later that month, the pro-administration ''[[Detroit Tribune]]'' printed an item calling Pierce \"a prowling traitor spy\", and intimating that he was a member of the pro-Confederate [[Knights of the Golden Circle]]. No such conspiracy existed, but a Pierce supporter, Guy S. Hopkins, sent to the ''Tribune'' a letter purporting to be from a member of the Knights of the Golden Circle, indicating that \"President P.\" was part of a plot against the Union.<ref name = \"michigan\">See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 341\u2013343.</ref><ref name=\"michigan 2\">See {{harv|Boulard|2006}}, p. 85\u2013100.</ref> Hopkins intended for the ''Tribune'' to make the charges public, at which point Hopkins would admit authorship, thus making the ''Tribune'' editors seem overly partisan and gullible. Instead, the ''Tribune'' editors forwarded the Hopkins letter to government officials. Seward then ordered the arrest of possible \"traitors\" in Michigan, which included Hopkins. Hopkins confessed authorship of the letter and admitted the hoax, but despite this, Seward wrote to Pierce demanding to know if the charges were true. Pierce denied them, and Seward hastily backtracked. Later, Republican newspapers printed the Hopkins letter in spite of his admission that it was a hoax, and Pierce decided that he needed to clear his name publicly. When Seward refused to make their correspondence public, Pierce publicized his outrage by having a Senate ally, California's [[Milton Latham]], read the letters between Seward and Pierce into the Congressional record, to the administration's embarrassment.<ref name = \"michigan\" /><ref name= \"michigan 2\"/>\n\nThe institution of the draft and the arrest of outspoken anti-administration Democrat [[Clement Vallandigham]] further incensed Pierce, who gave an address to New Hampshire Democrats in July 1863 vilifying Lincoln. \"Who, I ask, has clothed the President with power to dictate to any one of us when we must or when we may speak, or be silent upon any subject, and especially in relation to the conduct of any public servant?\", he demanded.<ref name = \"speech\">See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 343\u2013357.</ref><ref name= \"speech2\">See {{harv|Boulard|2006}}, p. 109\u2013123.</ref> Pierce's comments were ill-received in much of the North, especially as his criticism of Lincoln's aims coincided with the twin Union victories at [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]] and [[Siege of Vicksburg|Vicksburg]]. Pierce's reputation in the North was further damaged the following month when the Mississippi plantation of the Confederate president, Jefferson Davis, was seized by Union soldiers. Pierce's correspondence with Davis, all pre-war, revealing his deep friendship with Davis and predicting that civil war would result in insurrection in the North, was sent to the press. Pierce's words hardened abolitionist sentiment against him.<ref name = \"speech\" /><ref name=\"speech2\"/>\n\nJane Pierce died of tuberculosis in Andover, Massachusetts in December 1863; she was buried at Old North Cemetery in Concord, New Hampshire. Pierce was further grieved by the death of his close friend Nathaniel Hawthorne in May 1864; he was with Hawthorne when the author died unexpectedly. Hawthorne had controversially dedicated his final book to Pierce. Some Democrats tried again to put Pierce's name up for consideration as the [[1864 United States presidential election|1864 presidential election]] unfolded, but he kept his distance; Lincoln easily won a second term. When news spread of [[Lincoln's assassination]] in April 1865, a mob gathered outside Pierce's home in Concord, demanding to know why he had not raised a flag as a public mourning gesture. Pierce grew angry, expressing sadness over Lincoln's death but denying any need for a public gesture. He told them that his history of military and public service proved his patriotism, which was enough to quiet the crowd.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 357\u201362.</ref>\n\n===Final years and death===\nPierce's drinking impaired his health in his last years, but he grew increasingly spiritual. He had a brief relationship with an unknown woman in mid-1865. During this time, he used his influence to improve the treatment of Davis, now a prisoner at [[Fort Monroe]] in Virginia. He also offered financial help to Hawthorne's son Julian, as well as to his own nephews. On the second anniversary of Jane's death, Pierce was baptized into his wife's [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] faith at St. Paul's Church in Concord. He found this church to be less political than his former Congregational denomination, which had alienated Democrats with anti-slavery rhetoric. He took up the life of an \"old farmer\", as he called himself, buying up property, drinking less, farming the land himself, and hosting visiting relatives.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 363\u2013366.</ref> He spent most of his time in Concord and his cottage at [[Little Boar's Head Historic District|Little Boar's Head]] on the coast, sometimes visiting Jane's relatives in Massachusetts. Still interested in politics, he expressed support for [[Andrew Johnson]]'s [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] policy and supported the president's acquittal in his [[Impeachment of Andrew Johnson|impeachment trial]]; he later expressed optimism for Johnson's successor, Ulysses S. Grant.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 366\u2013371.</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Death}}\nPierce's health began to decline again in mid-1869; he resumed heavy drinking despite his deteriorating physical condition. He returned to Concord that September, suffering from severe [[cirrhosis]] of the liver, knowing he would not recover. A caretaker was hired; none of his family members were present in his final days. He died at 4:35&nbsp;am on Friday, October 8, 1869. President Grant, who later defended Pierce's service in the Mexican-American War, declared a day of national mourning. Newspapers across the country carried lengthy front-page stories examining Pierce's colorful and controversial career. Pierce was interred next to his wife and two of his sons in the Minot enclosure at Concord's [[Old North Cemetery (Concord, New Hampshire)|Old North Cemetery]].<ref name=\"burial\">See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 369\u2013373.</ref>\n\nIn his last [[will (law)|will]], which he signed January 22, 1868, Pierce left a large number of specific bequests such as paintings, swords, horses, and other items to friends, family, and neighbors. Much of his $72,000 estate (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|72000|1869|r=-4}}}} today) went to his brother Henry's family, and to Hawthorne's children and Pierce's landlady. Henry's son Frank Pierce received the largest share.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 374.</ref>\n\n==Sites, memorials, and honors==\nIn addition to his LL.D. from Norwich University, Pierce also received honorary doctorates from Bowdoin College (1853) and [[Dartmouth College]] (1860).<ref>{{cite book |last= Dartmouth College |date= 1900 |title= General Catalogue |url= https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_sKM4AAAAYAAJ |quote= Franklin Pierce LL.D. dartmouth. |publisher= Dartmouth College |page= [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_sKM4AAAAYAAJ/page/n432 405]|accessdate= August 30, 2014}}</ref>\n\nTwo places in New Hampshire have been listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] specifically because of their association with Pierce.

He was honest and tenacious of his views but, as he made up his mind with difficulty and often reversed himself before making a final decision, he gave a general impression of instability. Kind, courteous, generous, he attracted many individuals, but his attempts to satisfy all factions failed and made him many enemies. In carrying out his principles of strict construction he was most in accord with Southerners, who generally had the letter of the law on their side. He failed utterly to realize the depth and the sincerity of Northern feeling against the South and was bewildered at the general flouting of the law and the Constitution, as he described it, by the people of his own New England. At no time did he catch the popular imagination. His inability to cope with the difficult problems that arose early in his administration caused him to lose the respect of great numbers, especially in the North, and his few successes failed to restore public confidence.

His view of the Constitution and the Union was from the Jacksonian past. He never fully understood the nature or depth of Free Soil sentiment in the North. He was able to negotiate a reciprocal trade treaty with Canada, to begin the opening of Japan to western trade, to add land to the Southwest, and to sign legislation for the creation of an overseas empire [the [[Guano Islands Act]]]. His Cuba and Kansas policies led only to deeper sectional strife. His support for the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act and his determination to enforce the Fugitive Slave Act helped polarize the sections. Pierce was hard-working and his administration largely untainted by graft, yet the legacy from those four turbulent years contributed to the tragedy of secession and civil war.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gara|first=Larry|title=Pierce, Franklin|url=http://www.anb.org/articles/04/04-00788.html|work= American National Biography Online|date=February 2000}}{{subscription}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n== See also ==\n* {{Books-inline|Presidents of the United States (1789\u20131860)}}\n* [[List of New Hampshire historical markers (76\u2013100)#80|New Hampshire Historical Marker No. 80]]: Franklin Pierce 1804\u20131869\n* [[List of deaths through alcohol]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=\"note\"}}\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==== Works cited ====\n{{external media|float=right|video1=[https://www.c-span.org/video/?184075-1/franklin-pierce-new-hampshires-favorite-son ''Booknotes'' interview with Peter Wallner on ''Franklin Pierce: New Hampshire`s Favorite Son'', November 28, 2004], [[C-SPAN]]}}\n{{Refbegin|60em}}\n* {{cite book|ref={{harvid|Boulard|2006}}|last=Boulard|first=Garry|title=The Expatriation of Franklin Pierce: The Story of a President and the Civil War|publisher=iUniverse, Inc.|year=2006|isbn=0-595-40367-0}}\n* {{cite book|ref={{harvid|Butler|1908}}|last=Butler|first=Pierce|year=1908|author-link=Pierce Butler (justice)|title=Judah P.

He alienated anti-slavery groups by championing and signing the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]] and enforcing the [[Fugitive Slave Act]], yet he failed to stem conflict between North and South, setting the stage for Southern [[Secession in the United States|secession]] and the [[American Civil War]].\n\nPierce was born in [[History of New Hampshire|New Hampshire]], and served in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] and the [[U.S. Senate|Senate]] until he resigned from the Senate in 1842. His private law practice was a success, and he was appointed [[United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire#U.S. Attorney for New Hampshire|New Hampshire's U.S. Attorney]] in 1845. He took part in the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] as a [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] in the Army. He was seen by Democrats as a compromise candidate uniting northern and southern interests and was nominated as the party's candidate for president on the 49th ballot at the [[1852 Democratic National Convention]]. He and running mate [[William R. King]] easily defeated the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] ticket of [[Winfield Scott]] and [[William Alexander Graham|William A. Graham]] in the [[1852 United States presidential election|1852 presidential election]].\n\nAs president, Pierce simultaneously attempted to enforce neutral standards for civil service while also satisfying the diverse elements of the Democratic Party with patronage, an effort which largely failed and turned many in his party against him. He was a [[Young America movement|Young America]] expansionist who signed the [[Gadsden Purchase]] of land from [[Mexico]] and led a failed attempt to acquire Cuba from Spain. He signed trade treaties with Britain and Japan, while his Cabinet reformed their departments and improved accountability, but these successes were overshadowed by political strife during his presidency. His popularity declined sharply in the [[New England|Northern states]] after he supported the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act, which nullified the [[Missouri Compromise]], while many whites in the South continued to support him. Passage of the act led to [[Bleeding Kansas|violent conflict]] over the expansion of slavery in the American West. Pierce's administration was further damaged when several of his diplomats issued the [[Ostend Manifesto]] calling for the annexation of Cuba, a document which was roundly criticized. He fully expected to be renominated by the Democrats in the [[1856 United States presidential election|1856 presidential election]], but was abandoned by his party and his bid failed. His reputation in the North suffered further during the [[American Civil War]] as he became a vocal critic of President [[Abraham Lincoln]].\n\nPierce was popular and outgoing, but his family life was a grim affair, with his wife [[Jane Pierce|Jane]] suffering from illness and depression for much of her life.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jeffrey W. Coker|title=Presidents from Taylor Through Grant, 1849\u20131877: Debating the Issues in Pro and Con Primary Documents|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bVCVFXG9mqkC&pg=PA54|year=2002|publisher=Greenwood|page=54|isbn=978-0-313-31551-0|quote=\"Attractive, polished, and outgoing, he was remembered by classmates more for his social skills than his scholarship... he married Jane Means Appleton, the daughter of Bowdoin College's president...

He was a heavy drinker for much of his life, and he died of [[cirrhosis of the liver]] in 1869.

He was a sixth-generation descendant of Thomas Pierce, who had moved to the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] from [[Norwich, Norfolk]], England in about 1634. His father [[Benjamin Pierce (governor)|Benjamin]] was a lieutenant in the [[American Revolutionary War]] who moved from [[Chelmsford, Massachusetts]] to Hillsborough after the war, purchasing {{convert|50|acre}} of land. Pierce was the fifth of eight children born to Benjamin and his second wife Anna Kendrick; his first wife Elizabeth Andrews died in childbirth, leaving a daughter. Benjamin was a prominent [[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republican]]{{refn|group=note|This was called the ''Republican'' or ''Jeffersonian Republican Party'' at the time; it soon became known as the ''[[Democratic-Republican Party]]''. Modern writers prefer this term to distinguish it from the modern-day [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].}} state legislator, farmer, and tavern-keeper. During Pierce's childhood, his father was deeply involved in state politics, while two of his older brothers fought in the [[War of 1812]]; public affairs and the military were thus a major influence in his early life.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 1\u20138.</ref>\n\nPierce's father ensured that his sons were educated, and he placed Pierce in a school at Hillsborough Center in childhood and sent him to the town school at Hancock at age 12.{{refn|group=note|The two-story school building burned some years later, and Hancock Academy was founded in 1836 to fill its place.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hurd |first1=D.

His father fed him dinner and drove him part of the distance back to school before kicking him out of the carriage and ordering him to walk the rest of the way in a thunderstorm. Pierce later cited this moment as \"the turning-point in my life\".<ref name = \"turning\">See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 10\u201315.</ref> Later that year, he transferred to [[Phillips Exeter Academy]] to prepare for college. By this time, he had built a reputation as a charming student, sometimes prone to misbehavior.<ref name = \"turning\"/>\n[[File:Nathaniel Hawthorne.jpg|thumb|Novelist [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] remained lifelong friends with Pierce.

He joined the Athenian Society, a progressive literary society, alongside [[Jonathan Cilley]] (later elected to Congress) and [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], with whom he formed lasting friendships. He was the last in his class after two years, but he worked hard to improve his grades and graduated in fifth place in 1824<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 16\u201321.</ref> in a graduating class of 14.<ref>See {{harv|Holt|2010}}, loc. 229.</ref> [[John P. Hale]] enrolled at Bowdoin in Pierce's junior year; he became a political ally of Pierce's and then his rival. Pierce organized and led an unofficial militia company called the Bowdoin Cadets during his junior year, which included Cilley and Hawthorne. The unit performed drill on campus near the president's house, until the noise caused him to demand that it halt. The students rebelled and went on strike, an event that Pierce was suspected of leading.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wallner |first=Peter A. |date=Spring 2005 |title=Franklin Pierce and Bowdoin College Associates Hawthorne and Hale |url=https://www.nhhistory.org/publications/Revealing_RelationShips_Franklin_Pierce.pdf |journal=Historical New Hampshire |publisher=New Hampshire Historical Society |page=24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150817151324/http://www.nhhistory.org/publications/Revealing_RelationShips_Franklin_Pierce.pdf |archivedate=August 17, 2015 |quote=Within the student body, Pierce's influence was widespread.

The Reverend William Allen, the college's president, objected to the noise and ordered a halt to the activity. When Pierce refused to comply with Allen's order, animosity grew between the students and the college authorities resulting in the junior class going on strike. Pierce was accused of leading the rebellion, but the college records do not acknowledge the event. Pierce's father took note of his son's role, however, and in a rare letter, admonished him about his behavior.

They opposed the established [[Federalist Party|Federalists]] (and their successors, the [[National Republican Party|National Republicans]]), who were led by sitting President [[John Quincy Adams]]. The work of the New Hampshire Democratic Party came to fruition in March 1827, when their pro-Jackson nominee, Benjamin Pierce, won the support of the pro-Adams faction and was elected governor of New Hampshire essentially unopposed. While the younger Pierce had set out to build a career as an attorney, he was fully drawn into the realm of politics as the [[1828 United States presidential election|1828 presidential election]] between Adams and Jackson approached. In the state elections held in March 1828, the Adams faction withdrew their support of Benjamin Pierce, voting him out of office,{{refn|group=note|The [[governor of New Hampshire]] was then elected annually; see also [[List of Governors of New Hampshire]].}} but Franklin Pierce won his first election, as Hillsborough [[Town meeting#Traditional town meetings|town moderator]], a position to which he would be elected for six consecutive years.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 28\u201333.</ref>\n\nPierce actively campaigned in his district on behalf of Jackson, who carried both the district and the nation by large margins in the November 1828 election, even though he [[1828 United States presidential election in New Hampshire|lost New Hampshire]]. The outcome further strengthened the Democratic Party, and Pierce won his first legislative seat the following year, representing Hillsborough in the [[New Hampshire House of Representatives]]. Pierce's father, meanwhile, was elected again as governor, retiring after that term. The younger Pierce was appointed as chairman of the House Education Committee in 1829 and the Committee on Towns the following year. By 1831 the Democrats held a legislative majority, and Pierce was elected Speaker of the House. The young Speaker used his platform to oppose the expansion of banking, protect the state militia, and offer support to the national Democrats and Jackson's re-election effort. At the age of 27, he was a star of the New Hampshire Democratic Party. Though attaining early political and professional success, in his personal letters he continued to lament his bachelorhood and yearned for a life beyond Hillsborough.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 33\u201343.</ref>\n\nLike all white males in New Hampshire between the ages of 18 and 45, Pierce was a member of the [[New Hampshire Army National Guard|state militia]], and was appointed [[aide de camp]] to Governor [[Samuel Dinsmoor]] in 1831.

Jackson's second term was under way, and the House had a strong Democratic majority, whose primary focus was to prevent the [[Second Bank of the United States]] from being rechartered. The Democrats, including Pierce, defeated proposals supported by the newly formed Whig Party, and the bank's charter expired. Pierce broke from his party on occasion, opposing Democratic bills to fund [[internal improvements]] with federal money. He saw both the bank and infrastructure spending as unconstitutional, with internal improvements the responsibility of the states. Pierce's first term was fairly uneventful from a legislative standpoint, and he was easily re-elected in March 1835. When not in Washington, he attended to his law practice, and in December 1835 returned to the capital for the [[Twenty-fourth United States Congress|Twenty-fourth Congress]].<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 47\u201357.</ref>\n\nAs [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]] grew more vocal in the mid-1830s, Congress was inundated with petitions from anti-slavery groups seeking legislation to restrict slavery in the United States. From the beginning, Pierce found the abolitionists' \"agitation\" to be an annoyance, and saw federal action against slavery as an infringement on southern states' rights, even though he was morally opposed to slavery itself.<ref name=\"wallner-i-57-59\" /> He was also frustrated with the \"religious bigotry\" of abolitionists, who cast their political opponents as sinners.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 92.</ref> \"I consider slavery a social and political evil,\" Pierce said, \"and most sincerely wish that it had no existence upon the face of the earth.\"<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 71\u201372.</ref> Still, he wrote in December 1835, \"One thing must be perfectly apparent to every intelligent man. This abolition movement must be crushed or there is an end to the Union.\"<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 67.</ref>\n\nWhen Rep. [[James Henry Hammond]] of South Carolina looked to prevent anti-slavery petitions from reaching the House floor, however, Pierce sided with the abolitionists' right to petition. Nevertheless, Pierce supported what came to be known as the [[21st Rule|gag rule]], which allowed for petitions to be received, but not read or considered. This passed the House in 1836.<ref name=\"wallner-i-57-59\">See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 57\u201359.</ref> He was attacked by the New Hampshire anti-slavery ''Herald of Freedom'' as a \"[[doughface]]\", which had the dual meaning of \"craven-spirited man\" and \"northerner with southern sympathies\".<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 59\u201361.</ref> Pierce had stated that not one in 500 New Hampshirites were abolitionists; the ''Herald of Freedom'' article added up the number of signatures on petitions from that state, divided by the number of residents according to the 1830 census, and suggested the actual number was one-in-33. Pierce was outraged when South Carolina Senator [[John C. Calhoun]] read the article on the Senate floor as \"proof\" that New Hampshire was a hotbed of abolitionism. Calhoun apologized after Pierce replied to him in a speech which stated that most signatories were women and children, who could not vote, which therefore cast doubt on the one-in-33 figure.<ref>See {{harv|Holt|2010}}, loc. 362\u201375.</ref>\n\n===U.S. Senate===\n[[File:Franklin Pierce by Southworth & Hawes c1852.png|thumb|right|Pierce in 1852]]\nThe resignation in May 1836 of Senator Isaac Hill, who had been elected governor of New Hampshire, left a short-term opening to be filled by the state legislature, and with Hill's term as senator due to expire in March 1837, the legislature also had to fill the six-year term to follow. Pierce's candidacy for the Senate was championed by state Representative John P. Hale, a fellow Athenian at Bowdoin. After much debate, the legislature chose [[John Page (New Hampshire)|John Page]] to fill the rest of Hill's term. In December 1836, Pierce was elected to the full term, to commence in March 1837, and at age 32, was at the time one of the youngest members in Senate history. The election came at a difficult time for Pierce, as his father, sister, and brother were all seriously ill, while his wife also continued to suffer from chronic poor health. As senator, he was able to help his old friend Nathaniel Hawthorne, who often struggled financially, procuring for him a [[sinecure]] as measurer of coal and salt at the Boston Customs House that allowed the author time to continue writing.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 64\u201369.</ref>\n\nPierce voted the party line on most issues and was an able senator, but not an eminent one; he was overshadowed by the [[Great Triumvirate]] of Calhoun, [[Henry Clay]], and [[Daniel Webster]], who dominated the Senate.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 68, 91\u201392.</ref> Pierce entered the Senate at a time of economic crisis, as the [[Panic of 1837]] had begun. He considered the depression a result of the banking system's rapid growth, amidst \"the extravagance of overtrading and the wilderness of speculation\".<ref name = \"w6972\" /> So that federal money would not support speculative bank loans, he supported newly elected Democratic president [[Martin Van Buren]] and his plan to create an [[Independent Treasury|independent treasury]], a proposal which split the Democratic Party. Debate over slavery continued in Congress, and abolitionists proposed its end in the District of Columbia, where Congress had jurisdiction. Pierce supported a resolution by Calhoun against this proposal, which Pierce considered a dangerous stepping stone to nationwide emancipation.<ref name = \"w6972\">See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 69\u201372.</ref> Meanwhile, the Whigs were growing in congressional strength, which would leave Pierce's party with only a small majority by the end of the decade.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 80.</ref>\n\nOne topic of particular importance to Pierce was the military. He challenged a bill which would expand the ranks of the Army's staff officers in Washington without any apparent benefit to line officers at posts in the rest of the country. He took an interest in military pensions, seeing abundant fraud within the system, and was named chairman of the Senate Committee on Military Pensions in the [[Twenty-sixth United States Congress|Twenty-sixth Congress]] (1839\u20131841). In that capacity, he urged the modernization and expansion of the Army, with a focus on militias and mobility rather than on coastal fortifications, which he considered outdated.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 78\u201384.</ref>\n\nPierce campaigned vigorously throughout his home state for Van Buren's re-election in the [[1840 United States presidential election|1840 presidential election]]. The incumbent carried New Hampshire but lost the national vote to [[William Henry Harrison]], the military hero, whose Whigs took a majority of seats in the [[Twenty-seventh United States Congress|Twenty-seventh Congress]]. Harrison died after a month in office, and Vice President [[John Tyler]] succeeded him. Pierce and the Democrats were quick to challenge the new administration, questioning the removal of federal officeholders, and opposing Whig plans for a national bank. In December 1841 Pierce decided to resign from Congress, something he had been planning for some time.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 84\u201390.</ref> New Hampshire Democrats insisted that their state's U. S. senators be limited to one six-year term, so he had little likelihood of re-election. Also, he was frustrated at being a member of the legislative minority and wished to devote his time to his family and law practice.<ref>See {{harv|Holt|2010}}, loc. 419.</ref> His last actions in the Senate in February 1842 were to oppose a bill distributing federal funds to the states \u2013 believing that the money should go to the military instead \u2013 and to challenge the Whigs to reveal the results of their investigation of the [[Collector of the Port of New York|New York Customs House]], where the Whigs had probed for Democratic corruption for nearly a year but had issued no findings.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 91\u201392.</ref>\n\n==Party leader==\n\n===Lawyer and politician===\n[[File:Piercemanse.JPG|thumb|The [[Concord, New Hampshire]] house where Pierce lived from 1842 to 1848 is now known as the [[Pierce Manse]].

Pierce, meanwhile, had begun a demanding but lucrative law partnership with [[Asa Fowler]] during congressional recesses.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 86.</ref> Pierce returned to Concord in early 1842, and his reputation as a lawyer continued to flourish. Known for his gracious personality, eloquence, and excellent memory, Pierce attracted large audiences in court. He would often represent poor people for little or no compensation.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 98\u2013101.</ref>\n\nPierce remained involved in the state Democratic Party, which was split by several issues. Governor Hill, who represented the commercial, urban wing of the party, advocated the use of government charters to support corporations, granting them privileges such as limited liability and eminent domain for building railroads. The radical \"[[Locofocos|locofoco]]\" wing of his party represented farmers and other rural voters, who sought an expansion of social programs and labor regulations and a restriction on corporate privilege. The state's political culture grew less tolerant of banks and corporations after the Panic of 1837, and Hill was voted out of office. Pierce was closer to the radicals philosophically, and reluctantly agreed to represent Hill's adversary in a legal dispute regarding ownership of a newspaper\u2014Hill lost, and founded his own paper, of which Pierce was a frequent target.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 93\u201395.</ref>\n\nIn June 1842 Pierce was named chairman of the State Democratic Committee, and in the following year's state election he helped the radical wing take over the state legislature. The party remained divided on several issues, including railroad development and the [[temperance movement]], and Pierce took a leading role in helping the state legislature settle their differences. His priorities were \"order, moderation, compromise, and party unity\", which he tried to place ahead of his personal views on political issues.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 103\u201310.</ref> As he would as president, Pierce valued Democratic Party unity highly, and saw the opposition to slavery as a threat to that.<ref>See {{harv|Holt|2010}}, loc. 431.</ref>\n\nDemocratic [[James K. Polk]]'s [[dark horse]] victory in the [[1844 United States presidential election|1844 presidential election]] was welcome news to Pierce, who had befriended the former [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] while both served in Congress. Pierce had campaigned heavily for Polk during the election, and in turn Polk appointed him as [[United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire#U.S. Attorney for New Hampshire|United States Attorney for New Hampshire]].<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 131\u201332.</ref> Polk's most prominent cause was the [[annexation of Texas]], an issue which caused a dramatic split between Pierce and his former ally Hale, now a U.S. Representative. Hale was so impassioned against adding a new slave state that he wrote a public letter to his constituents outlining his opposition to the measure.<ref>See {{harv|Wadleigh|1913}}, p. 249: \"Jan.7.-Hon. John P. Hale's letter to his constituents against the annexation of Texas, published\".</ref> Pierce responded by re-assembling the state Democratic convention to revoke Hale's nomination for another term in Congress.<ref>See {{harv|Wadleigh|1913}}, p. 249: \"John P. Hale, who had been nominated for re-election to Congress by the Democratic party, was at this election dropped from the ticket, and John Woodbury substituted, in consequence of Mr. Hale's refusal to go with the party in voting for the annexation of Texas. A portion of the party, consisting of those who approved of his opposition to the extension of slavery, voted for him, and succeeded in defeating his opponent, leaving a vacancy in the delegation\".</ref> The political firestorm led to Pierce severing ties with his longtime friend, and with his law partner Fowler, who was a Hale supporter.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 111\u201322.</ref> Hale refused to withdraw, and as a majority vote was needed for election in New Hampshire, the party split led to deadlock and a vacant House seat. Eventually, the Whigs and Hale's [[Independent Democrat]]s took control of the legislature, elected Whig [[Anthony Colby]] as governor and sent Hale to the Senate, much to Pierce's anger.<ref>See {{harv|Holt|2010}}, loc. 447.</ref>\n\n===Mexican\u2013American War===\n[[File:Franklin Pierce - 1852.jpg|thumb|upright|Pierce in his brigadier general's uniform]]\nActive military service was a long-held dream for Pierce, who had admired his father's and brothers' service in his youth, particularly his older brother [[Benjamin Kendrick Pierce|Benjamin]]'s, as well as that of [[John McNeil Jr.]], husband of Pierce's older half-sister Elizabeth. As a legislator, he was a passionate advocate for volunteer militias. As a militia officer himself, he had experience mustering and drilling bodies of troops. When Congress declared war against Mexico in May 1846, Pierce immediately volunteered to join, although no New England regiment yet existed. His hope to fight in the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] was one reason he refused an offer to become Polk's [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]]. General [[Zachary Taylor]]'s advance slowed in northern Mexico, and General [[Winfield Scott]] proposed capturing the port of [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Vera Cruz]] and driving overland to Mexico City. Congress passed a bill authorizing the creation of ten regiments, and Pierce was appointed commander and colonel of the [[9th Infantry Regiment (United States)|9th Infantry Regiment]] in February 1847, with Truman B. Ransom as [[Lieutenant Colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] and second-in-command.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 131\u201335.</ref>\n\n[[File:FrankP-mounted.jpg|thumb|left|Pierce's brief term as a [[general officer|general]] in the Mexican\u2013American War boosted his public image.<ref name=\"war-reception\" />|alt=Illustration of Franklin Pierce as a general, riding a horse]]\nOn March 3, 1847, Pierce was promoted to [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]], and took command of a [[brigade]] of reinforcements for General Scott's army, with Ransom succeeding to command of the regiment. Needing time to assemble his brigade, Pierce reached the already-seized port of Vera Cruz in late June, where he prepared a march of 2,500 men accompanying supplies for Scott. The three-week journey inland was perilous, and the men fought off several attacks before joining with Scott's army in early August, in time for the [[Battle of Contreras]].<ref>See {{harv|Holt|2010}}, loc. 490.</ref> The battle was disastrous for Pierce: his horse was suddenly startled during a charge, knocking him groin-first against his saddle. The horse then tripped into a crevice and fell, pinning Pierce underneath and debilitating his knee.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 144\u201347.</ref> The incident made it look like he had fainted, causing one soldier to call for someone else to take command, \"General Pierce is a damned coward.\"<ref name = \"h505\">See {{harv|Holt|2010}}, loc. 505.</ref> Pierce returned for the following day's action, but re-injured his knee, forcing him to hobble after his men; by the time he caught up, the battle was mostly won.<ref name = h505 />\n\nAs the [[Battle of Churubusco]] approached, Scott ordered Pierce to the rear to convalesce. He responded, \"For God's sake, General, this is the last great battle, and I must lead my brigade.\" Scott yielded, and Pierce entered the fight tied to his saddle, but the pain in his leg became so great that he passed out on the field. The Americans won the battle and Pierce helped negotiate an armistice. He then returned to command and led his brigade throughout the rest of the campaign, eventually taking part in the [[Battle for Mexico City|capture of Mexico City]] in mid-September, although his brigade was held in reserve for much of the battle.<ref name = w147plus /> For much of the Mexico City battle, he was in the sick tent, plagued with acute diarrhea.<ref name = h505 /> Pierce remained in command of his brigade during the three-month occupation of the city; while frustrated with the stalling of peace negotiations, he also tried to distance himself from the constant conflict between Scott and the other generals.<ref name = w147plus>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 147\u201354.</ref>\n\nPierce was finally allowed to return to Concord in late December 1847. He was given a hero's welcome in his home state, and submitted his resignation from the Army, which was approved on March 20, 1848. His military exploits elevated his popularity in New Hampshire, but his injuries and subsequent troubles in battle led to accusations of cowardice which would long shadow him. He had demonstrated competence as a general, especially in the initial march from Vera Cruz, but his short tenure and his injury left little for historians to judge his ability as a military commander.<ref name=\"war-reception\">See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 154\u2013157.</ref>\n\n[[Ulysses S.

His role as a party leader, however, continued to take up most of his attention. He continued to wrangle with Senator Hale, who was anti-slavery and had opposed the war, stances that Pierce regarded as needless agitation.<ref name=\"leadership\">See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 157\u201361.</ref>\n\nThe large [[Mexican Cession]] of land divided the United States politically, with many in the North insisting that slavery not be allowed there (and offering the [[Wilmot Proviso]] to ensure it), while others wanted slavery barred north of the [[Missouri Compromise]] line of [[Parallel 36\u00b030\u2032 north|36\u00b030\u2032 N]]. Both proposals were anathema to many Southerners, and the controversy split the Democrats. At the [[1848 Democratic National Convention]], the majority nominated former Michigan senator [[Lewis Cass]] for president, while a minority broke off to become the [[Free Soil Party]], backing former president Van Buren. The Whigs chose General [[Zachary Taylor]], a Louisianan, whose views on most political issues were unknown. Despite his past support for Van Buren, Pierce supported Cass, turning down the quiet offer of second place on the Free Soil [[ticket (politics)|ticket]], and was so effective that Taylor, who was [[1848 United States presidential election|elected president]], was held in New Hampshire to his lowest percentage in any state.<ref>See {{harv|Holt|2010}}, p. 549\u201365.</ref>\n\nSenator Henry Clay, a Whig, hoped to put the slavery question to rest with a set of proposals that became known as the [[Compromise of 1850]]. These would give victories to North and South, and gained the support of his fellow Whig, Webster. With the bill stalled in the Senate, Illinois Senator [[Stephen A. Douglas]] led a successful effort to split it into separate measures so that each legislator could vote against the parts his state opposed without endangering the overall package. The bills passed, and were signed by President [[Millard Fillmore]] (who had succeeded Taylor after the president's death earlier in 1850).<ref>See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 21\u201322.</ref> Pierce strongly supported the compromise, giving a well-received speech in December 1850 pledging himself to \"The Union!

It was widely expected that the [[1852 Democratic National Convention]] would result in deadlock, with no major candidate able to win the necessary two-thirds majority. New Hampshire Democrats, including Pierce, supported his old teacher, Levi Woodbury, by then an [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Justice of the Supreme Court]], as a compromise candidate, but Woodbury's death in September 1851 opened up an opportunity for Pierce's allies to present him as a potential dark horse in the mold of Polk. New Hampshire Democrats felt that, as the state in which their party had most consistently gained Democratic majorities, they should supply the presidential candidate. Other possible standard-bearers included Douglas, Cass, [[William Marcy]] of New York, [[James Buchanan]] of Pennsylvania, [[Sam Houston]] of Texas, and [[Thomas Hart Benton (politician)|Thomas Hart Benton]] of Missouri.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 181\u201384.</ref><ref>See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 23\u201329.</ref>\n\nDespite home state support, Pierce faced obstacles to his nomination, since he had been out of office for a decade, and also lacked the front-runners' national reputation. He publicly declared that such a nomination would be \"utterly repugnant to my tastes and wishes\", but given the desire of New Hampshire Democrats to see one of their own elected, he knew his future influence depended on his availability to run.<ref name =w184plus /> Thus, he quietly allowed his supporters to lobby for him, with the understanding that his name would not be entered at the convention unless it was clear none of the front-runners could win. To broaden his potential base of southern support as the convention approached, he wrote letters reiterating his support for the Compromise of 1850, including the controversial [[Fugitive Slave Act]].<ref name =w184plus>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 184\u201397.</ref><ref>See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 32\u201333.</ref>\n\nThe convention assembled on June 1 in [[Baltimore]], Maryland, and the deadlock occurred as expected. On the first ballot of the 288 delegates, held on June 3, Cass claimed 116, Buchanan 93, and the rest were scattered, without a single vote for Pierce. The next 34 ballots passed with no winner even close, and still no votes for Pierce. The Buchanan team then had their delegates vote for minor candidates, including Pierce, to demonstrate Buchanan's inevitability, and unite the convention behind him. This novel tactic backfired after several ballots as Virginia, New Hampshire, and Maine switched to Pierce; the remaining Buchanan forces began to break for Marcy, and Pierce was soon in third place. After the 48th ballot, North Carolina Congressman [[James C. Dobbin]] delivered an unexpected and passionate endorsement of Pierce, sparking a wave of support for the dark horse candidate. On the 49th ballot, Pierce received all but six of the votes, and thus gained the Democratic nomination for president. Delegates selected Alabama Senator [[William R. King]], a Buchanan supporter, as Pierce's [[running mate]], and adopted a [[party platform]] that rejected further \"agitation\" over the slavery issue and supported the Compromise of 1850.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 197\u2013202</ref><ref>See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 33\u201334.</ref>\n\nWhen word reached New Hampshire of the result, Pierce found it difficult to believe, and his wife fainted. Their son Benjamin wrote to his mother hoping that Franklin's candidacy would not be successful, as he knew she would not like to live in Washington.<ref>See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 34.</ref>\n\n[[File:Scott vs Pierce campaign.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.6|This anti-Pierce political cartoon depicts him as weak and cowardly|alt=Political cartoon]]\nThe Whig candidate was General Scott, Pierce's commander in Mexico; his running mate was [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] [[William Alexander Graham|William A. Graham]]. The Whigs could not unify their factions as the Democrats had, and the convention adopted a platform almost indistinguishable from that of the Democrats, including support of the Compromise of 1850. This incited the Free Soilers to field their own candidate, Senator Hale of New Hampshire, at the expense of the Whigs. The lack of political differences reduced the campaign to a bitter personality contest and helped to dampen [[voter turnout]] to its lowest level since [[U.S. presidential election, 1836|1836]]; according to biographer Peter A. Wallner, it was \"one of the least exciting campaigns in presidential history\".<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 210\u201313</ref><ref>See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 36\u201338.</ref> Scott was harmed by the lack of enthusiasm of anti-slavery northern Whigs for him and the platform; ''[[New-York Tribune]]'' editor [[Horace Greeley]] summed up the attitude of many when he said of the Whig platform, \"we defy it, execrate it, spit upon it\".<ref>See {{harv|Holt|2010}}, loc. 724.</ref>\n\n[[File:ElectoralCollege1852.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|right|Electoral map of the [[1852 United States presidential election|1852 presidential election]]|alt=Map]]\nPierce kept quiet so as not to upset his party's delicate unity, and allowed his allies to run the campaign.

Weeks after his election, on January 6, 1853, the President-elect's family had been traveling from Boston by train when their car derailed and rolled down an [[embankment (transportation)|embankment]] near [[Andover, Massachusetts]]. Both Franklin and Jane Pierce survived, but in the wreckage found their only remaining son, 11-year-old Benjamin, crushed to death, his body nearly decapitated. Pierce was not able to hide the gruesome sight from his wife. They both suffered severe depression afterward, which likely affected Pierce's performance as president.<ref name=\"benny\">See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 241\u201349.</ref><ref>See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 43\u201344.</ref> Jane Pierce wondered if the train accident was divine punishment for her husband's pursuit and acceptance of high office. She wrote a lengthy letter of apology to \"Benny\" for her failings as a mother.<ref name=\"benny\"/> She avoided social functions for much of her first two years as [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]], making her public debut in that role to great sympathy at the annual public reception held at the White House on New Year's Day, 1855.<ref>See {{harv|Boulard|2006}}, p. 55.</ref>\n\nWhen Franklin Pierce departed New Hampshire for the inauguration, Jane Pierce chose to remain. Pierce, then the youngest man to be elected president, chose to [[Affirmation in law|affirm]] his oath of office on a law book rather than swear it on a Bible, as all his predecessors except John Quincy Adams had done. He was the first president to deliver his [[Inauguration Day|inaugural address]] from memory.<ref>{{cite book |last= Hurja |first= Emil |date=1933|title=History of Presidential Inaugurations |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=KnY_AAAAIAAJ|publisher=New York Democrat |page= 49}}</ref> In the address he hailed an era of peace and prosperity at home and urged a vigorous assertion of U.S. interests in its foreign relations, including the \"eminently important\" acquisition of new territories. \"The policy of my Administration\", said the new president, \"will not be deterred by any timid forebodings of evil from expansion.\" Avoiding the word \"slavery\", he emphasized his desire to put the \"important subject\" to rest and maintain a peaceful union. He alluded to his own personal tragedy, telling the crowd, \"You have summoned me in my weakness, you must sustain me by your strength.\"<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 249\u201355.</ref>\n\n===Administration and political strife===\n{{See also|List of federal judges appointed by Franklin Pierce}}\n{{CSS image crop|Image = PIERCE, Franklin-President (BEP engraved portrait).jpg |bSize = 325|cWidth = 230|cHeight = 270|oTop = 50|oLeft = 45|Location = right|Description = [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing|BEP]]-engraved portrait of Pierce as president}}\n\nIn his [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]] appointments, Pierce sought to unite a party that was squabbling over the fruits of victory. Most in the party had not originally supported him for the nomination, and some had allied with the Free Soil party to gain victory in local elections. Pierce decided to allow each of the party's factions some appointments, even those that had not supported the Compromise of 1850.<ref>See {{harv|Holt|2010}}, loc. 767.</ref>\n\nAll of Pierce's cabinet nominations were unanimously and immediately confirmed by the Senate.<ref name =\"wall5plus\" /> Pierce spent the first few weeks of his term sorting through hundreds of lower-level federal positions to be filled. This was a chore, as he sought to represent all factions of the party, and could fully satisfy none of them. Partisans found themselves unable to secure positions for their friends, which put the Democratic Party on edge and fueled bitterness between factions. Before long, northern newspapers accused Pierce of filling his government with pro-slavery secessionists, while southern newspapers accused him of abolitionism.<ref name =\"wall5plus\">See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 5\u201324.</ref>\n\nFactionalism between the pro- and anti-administration Democrats ramped up quickly, especially within the New York Democratic Party. The more conservative Hardshell Democrats or \"Hards\" of New York were deeply skeptical of the Pierce administration, which was associated with Marcy (who became Secretary of State) and the more moderate New York faction, the Softshell Democrats or \"Softs\".<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 15\u201318, and throughout.</ref>\n\n[[File:William R.

By the start of 1853, King was severely ill with tuberculosis, and went to Cuba to recuperate. His condition deteriorated, and Congress passed a special law, allowing him to be sworn in before the American consul in Havana on March 24. Wanting to die at home, he returned to his plantation in Alabama on April 17 and died the next day. The office of vice president remained vacant for the remainder of Pierce's term, as the Constitution then had no provision for filling the vacancy. This extended vacancy meant that for nearly the entirety of Pierce's presidency the [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|Senate President pro tempore]], initially [[David Atchison]] of Missouri, was next in line to the presidency.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 21\u201322.</ref>\n\nPierce sought to run a more efficient and accountable government than his predecessors.<ref name=\"wallner-20\" /> His Cabinet members implemented an early system of [[United States federal civil service|civil service]] examinations which was a forerunner to the [[Pendleton Act]] passed three decades later, which mandated that most positions in the U.S. government should be awarded on the basis of merit, not patronage.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 35\u201336.</ref> The [[United States Department of the Interior|Interior Department]] was reformed by Secretary [[Robert McClelland (American politician)|Robert McClelland]], who systematized its operations, expanded the use of paper records, and pursued fraud.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 36\u201339.</ref> Another of Pierce's reforms was to expand the role of the U.S. attorney general in appointing federal judges and attorneys, which was an important step in the eventual development of the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]].<ref name=\"wallner-20\">See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 20.</ref> There was a vacancy on the Supreme Court\u2014Fillmore, having failed to get Senate confirmation for his nominees, had offered it to newly elected Louisiana Senator [[Judah P.

Marcy]] leading the charge as [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]]. Marcy sought to present to the world a distinctively American, republican image. He issued a circular recommending that U.S. diplomats wear \"the simple dress of an American citizen\" instead of the elaborate [[diplomatic uniform]]s worn in the courts of Europe, and that they only hire American citizens to work in consulates.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 25\u201332.</ref><ref>See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 128.</ref> Marcy received international praise for his 73-page letter defending Austrian refugee [[Martin Koszta]], who had been captured abroad in mid-1853 by the Austrian government despite his intention to become a U.S. citizen.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 61\u201363.</ref><ref>See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 128\u201329.</ref>\n\nDavis, an advocate of a southern transcontinental route, persuaded Pierce to send rail magnate [[James Gadsden]] to Mexico to buy land for a potential railroad. Gadsden was also charged with re-negotiating the provisions of the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] which required the U.S. to prevent Native American raids into Mexico from New Mexico Territory. Gadsden negotiated a treaty with Mexican President [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]] in December 1853, purchasing a large swath of land to America's southwest. Negotiations were nearly derailed by [[William Walker (filibuster)|William Walker]]'s [[filibuster (military)|unauthorized expedition]] into Mexico, and so a clause was included charging the U.S. with combating future such attempts.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 75\u201381.</ref><ref>See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 129\u201333.</ref> Congress reduced the [[Gadsden Purchase]] to the region now comprising southern [[Arizona]] and part of southern New Mexico; the price was cut from $15&nbsp;million to $10&nbsp;million.

Marcy completed a [[trade agreement|trade reciprocity agreement]] with British minister to Washington, [[Sir John Crampton, 2nd Baronet|John Crampton]], which reduced the need for aggressive coastline enforcement. Buchanan was sent as minister to London to pressure the British government, which was slow to support a new treaty. A favorable reciprocity treaty was ratified in August 1854, which Pierce saw as a first step towards the American annexation of Canada.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 27\u201330, 63\u201366, 125\u201326</ref><ref>See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 133.</ref> While the administration negotiated with Britain over the Canada\u2013US border, U.S. interests were also threatened in Central America, where the [[Clayton\u2013Bulwer Treaty]] of 1850 had failed to keep Great Britain from expanding its influence.

To the President's surprise, the British did not expel Buchanan in retaliation. In his December 1855 [[State of the Union|message to Congress]] Pierce had set forth the American case that Britain had violated the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty. The British, according to Buchanan, were impressed by the message and were rethinking their policy. Nevertheless, Buchanan was not successful in getting the British to renounce their Central American possessions. The Canadian treaty was ratified by Congress, the British Parliament, and by the colonial legislatures in Canada.<ref>See {{harv|Holt|2010}}, loc. 902\u201317.</ref>\n\nPierce's administration aroused sectional apprehensions when three U.S. diplomats in Europe drafted a proposal to the president to purchase [[Cuba]] from Spain for $120&nbsp;million (USD), and justify the \"wresting\" of it from Spain if the offer were refused. The publication of the [[Ostend Manifesto]], which had been drawn up at the insistence of Secretary of State Marcy, provoked the scorn of northerners who viewed it as an attempt to annex a slave-holding possession to bolster Southern interests. It helped discredit the expansionist policy of [[Manifest Destiny]] the Democratic Party had often supported.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 131\u201357.</ref><ref>See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 149\u2013155.</ref>\n\nPierce favored expansion and a substantial reorganization of the military.

[[organized territory|Organizing]] the largely unsettled [[Nebraska Territory]], which stretched from [[Missouri]] to the [[Rocky Mountains]], and from Texas north to what is now the Canada\u2013US border, was a crucial part of Douglas's plans for western expansion. He wanted a transcontinental railroad with a link from [[Chicago]] to California, through the vast western territory. Organizing the territory was necessary for settlement as the land would not be surveyed nor put up for sale until a territorial government was authorized. Those from slave states had never been content with western limits on slavery, and felt it should be able to expand into territories procured with blood and treasure that had come, in part, from the South. Douglas and his allies planned to organize the territory and let local settlers [[Popular sovereignty in the United States|decide whether to allow slavery]]. This would repeal the Missouri Compromise of 1820, as most of it was north of the 36\u00b030\u2032 N line the Missouri Compromise deemed \"free\". The territory would be split into a northern part, Nebraska, and a southern part, [[Kansas Territory|Kansas]], and the expectation was that Kansas would allow slavery and Nebraska would not.<ref name=\"kansas\">See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 90\u2013102, 119\u201322.</ref><ref name =\"kansas 2\">See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 88\u2013100.</ref><ref name = \"kansas 3\">See {{harv|Holt|2010}}, loc. 1097\u20131240.</ref> In the view of pro-slavery [[U.S. Southern states|Southern]] politicians, the Compromise of 1850 had already annulled the Missouri Compromise by admitting the state of [[California]], including territory south of the compromise line, as a free state.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Davis |first1=Jefferson |title=The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government |date=1881 |isbn=0-306-80418-2 |page=25|title-link=The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government }}</ref>\n\nPierce had wanted to organize the Nebraska Territory without explicitly addressing the matter of slavery, but Douglas could not get enough southern support to accomplish this.<ref>See {{harv|Etchison|2004}}, p. 14.</ref> Pierce was skeptical of the bill, knowing it would result in bitter opposition from the North. Douglas and Davis convinced him to support the bill regardless. It was tenaciously opposed by northerners such as Ohio Senator [[Salmon P. Chase]] and Massachusetts's [[Charles Sumner]], who rallied public sentiment in the North against the bill. Northerners had been suspicious of the Gadsden Purchase, moves towards Cuba annexation, and the influence of slaveholding Cabinet members such as Davis, and saw the Nebraska bill as part of a pattern of southern aggression. The result was a political firestorm that did great damage to Pierce's presidency.<ref name = \"kansas\" /><ref name = \"kansas 2\"/><ref name=\"kansas 3\"/>\n \nPierce and his administration used threats and promises to keep most Democrats on board in favor of the bill. The Whigs split along sectional lines; the conflict destroyed them as a national party. The Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act was passed in May 1854 and ultimately defined the Pierce presidency. The political turmoil that followed the passage saw the short-term rise of the nativist and anti-Catholic American Party, often called the [[Know Nothing]]s, and the founding of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].<ref name=\"kansas\" /><ref name=\"kansas 2\"/><ref name=\"kansas 3\"/>\n\n[[File:Forcing Slavery Freesoilers Throats.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|Northerners resented Pierce's attempted expansion of slavery through Kansas\u2013Nebraska and Cuba.<ref name=\"resentment\" /><ref name=\"resentment 2\"/> In this 1856 cartoon, a [[Free Soil Party|Free Soiler]] is held down by Pierce, Buchanan, and Cass while Douglas shoves \"Slavery\" (depicted as a black man) down his throat.|alt=Political cartoon]]\n\nEven as the act was being debated, settlers on both sides of the slavery issue poured into the territories so as to secure the outcome they wanted in the voting. The passage of the act resulted in so much violence between groups that the territory became known as [[Bleeding Kansas]]. Thousands of pro-slavery [[Border Ruffians]] came across from Missouri to vote in the territorial elections although they were not resident in Kansas, giving that element the victory. Pierce supported the outcome despite the irregularities. When [[Free-Stater (Kansas)|Free-Staters]] set up a shadow government, and drafted the [[Topeka Constitution]], Pierce called their work an act of rebellion. The president continued to recognize the pro-slavery legislature, which was dominated by Democrats, even after a Congressional investigative committee found its election to have been illegitimate. He dispatched federal troops to break up a meeting of the [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]] government.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 195\u2013209.</ref><ref>See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 111\u2013120.</ref>\n\nPassage of the act coincided with the seizure of escaped slave [[Anthony Burns]] in Boston. Northerners rallied in support of Burns, but Pierce was determined to follow the Fugitive Slave Act to the letter, and dispatched federal troops to enforce Burns's return to his Virginia owner despite furious crowds.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 122\u201325.</ref><ref>See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 107\u2013109.</ref>\n\nThe midterm congressional elections of 1854 and 1855 were devastating to the Democrats (as well as to the Whig Party, which was on its last legs). The Democrats lost almost every state outside the South. The administration's opponents in the North worked together to return opposition members to Congress, though only a few northern Whigs gained election. In Pierce's New Hampshire, hitherto loyal to the Democratic Party, the Know-Nothings elected the governor, all three representatives, dominated the legislature, and returned John P. Hale to the Senate. Anti-immigrant fervor brought the Know-Nothings their highest numbers to that point, and some northerners were elected under the auspices of the new Republican Party.<ref name=\"resentment\">See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 158\u201367.</ref><ref name=\"resentment 2\">See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 99\u2013100.</ref>\n\n===1856 election===\n{{Main|1856 Democratic National Convention}}\n\n[[File:Southern Chivalry.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Partisan violence spilled into Congress in May 1856 when Free Soil Senator [[Charles Sumner]] was [[caning of Charles Sumner|assaulted with a walking cane]] by Democratic Rep.

In reality his chances of winning the nomination were slim, let alone re-election. The administration was widely disliked in the North for its position on the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act, and Democratic leaders were aware of Pierce's electoral vulnerability. Nevertheless, his supporters began to plan for an alliance with Douglas to deny James Buchanan the nomination. Buchanan had solid political connections and had been safely overseas through most of Pierce's term, leaving him untainted by the Kansas debacle.<ref name=\"1856-convention\">See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 266\u201370.</ref><ref name=\"1856-convention 2\">See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 157\u201367.</ref><ref name=\"1856-convention 3\">See {{harv|Holt|2010}}, loc. 1515\u201358.</ref>\n\nWhen balloting began on June 5 at the convention in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], Pierce expected a plurality, if not the required two-thirds majority. On the first ballot, he received only 122 votes, many of them from the South, to Buchanan's 135, with Douglas and Cass receiving the rest. By the following morning fourteen ballots had been completed, but none of the three main candidates were able to get two-thirds of the vote. Pierce, whose support had been slowly declining as the ballots passed, directed his supporters to break for Douglas, withdrawing his name in a last-ditch effort to defeat Buchanan. Douglas, only 43 years of age, believed that he could be nominated in 1860 if he let the older Buchanan win this time, and received assurances from Buchanan's managers that this would be the case. After two more deadlocked ballots, Douglas's managers withdrew his name, leaving Buchanan as the clear winner. To soften the blow to Pierce, the convention issued a resolution of \"unqualified approbation\" in praise of his administration and selected his ally, former Kentucky Representative [[John C. Breckinridge]], as the vice-presidential nominee.<ref name=\"1856-convention\" /><ref name=\"1856-convention 2\" /><ref name=\"1856-convention 3\" /> This loss marked the only time in U.S. history that an elected president who was an active candidate for reelection was not nominated for a second term.{{refn|group=note|Pierce was the only president who had been elected as president to not be renominated by their party for a second term.

He installed [[John W.

Fr\u00e9mont]] and the Know Nothing, former president Fillmore.<ref>See {{harv|Holt|2010}}, loc. 1610\u201324.</ref>\n\nPierce did not temper his rhetoric after losing the nomination. In his final message to Congress, delivered in December 1856, he vigorously attacked Republicans and abolitionists. He took the opportunity to defend his record on fiscal policy, and on achieving peaceful relations with other nations.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 292\u2013296.</ref><ref>See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 177\u2013179.</ref> In the final days of the Pierce administration, Congress passed bills to increase the pay of army officers and to build new naval vessels, also expanding the number of seamen enlisted.

The Pierces eventually moved to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, where Pierce had begun to speculate in property. Seeking warmer weather, he and Jane spent the next three years traveling, beginning with a stay in [[Madeira]] and followed by tours of Europe and the [[Bahamas]].<ref name = \"postpres\" /> In Rome, he visited Nathaniel Hawthorne; the two men spent much time together and the author found the retired president as buoyant as ever.<ref>See {{harv|Boulard|2006}}, p. 55\u201356.</ref>\n\nPierce never lost sight of politics during his travels, commenting regularly on the nation's growing sectional conflict. He insisted that northern abolitionists stand down to avoid a southern secession, writing that the bloodshed of a civil war would \"not be along Mason and Dixon's line merely\", but \"within our own borders in our own streets\".<ref name = \"postpres\" /> He also criticized New England Protestant ministers, who largely supported abolition and Republican candidates, for their \"heresy and treason\".<ref name=\"postpres\">See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 309\u2013327.</ref> The rise of the Republican Party forced the Democrats to defend Pierce; during [[Lincoln-Douglas debates|his debates]] with Republican Senate candidate [[Abraham Lincoln]] in 1858, Douglas called the former president \"a man of integrity and honor\".<ref>See {{harv|Boulard|2006}}, p. 65\u201366.</ref>\n\nAs the Democratic Convention of 1860 approached, some asked Pierce to run as a compromise candidate that could unite the fractured party, but Pierce refused. As Douglas struggled to attract southern support, Pierce backed Cushing and then Breckinridge as potential alternatives, but his priority was a united Democratic Party. The split Democrats were soundly [[1860 United States presidential election|defeated]] for the presidency by the Republican candidate, Lincoln. In the months between Lincoln's election, and his inauguration on March 4, 1861, Pierce looked on as several southern states began plans to secede. He was asked by Justice Campbell to travel to Alabama and address that state's secession convention. Due to illness he declined, but sent a letter appealing to the people of Alabama to remain in the Union, and give the North time to repeal laws against southern interests and to find common ground.<ref name = \"secede\">See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 327\u2013338.</ref>\n\n===Civil War===\nAfter efforts to prevent the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] ended with the firing on [[Fort Sumter]], Northern Democrats, including Douglas, endorsed Lincoln's plan to bring the Southern states back into the fold by force. Pierce wanted to avoid war at all costs, and wrote to Van Buren, proposing an assembly of former U.S. presidents to resolve the issue, but this suggestion was not acted on. \"I will never justify, sustain or in any way or to any extent uphold this cruel, heartless, aimless, unnecessary war,\" Pierce wrote to his wife.<ref name = \"secede\" /> Pierce publicly opposed President Lincoln's order suspending the writ of [[habeas corpus in the United States|''habeas corpus'']], arguing that even in a time of war, the country should not abandon its protection of civil liberties. This stand won him admirers with the emerging [[Copperheads (politics)|Northern Peace Democrats]], but others saw the stand as further evidence of Pierce's southern bias.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 337\u2013343.</ref>\n\nIn September 1861, Pierce traveled to Michigan, visiting his former Interior Secretary, McClelland, former senator Cass, and others. A Detroit bookseller, J. A. Roys, sent a letter to Lincoln's Secretary of State, [[William H. Seward]], accusing the former president of meeting with disloyal people, and saying he had heard there was a plot to overthrow the government and establish Pierce as president. Later that month, the pro-administration ''[[Detroit Tribune]]'' printed an item calling Pierce \"a prowling traitor spy\", and intimating that he was a member of the pro-Confederate [[Knights of the Golden Circle]]. No such conspiracy existed, but a Pierce supporter, Guy S. Hopkins, sent to the ''Tribune'' a letter purporting to be from a member of the Knights of the Golden Circle, indicating that \"President P.\" was part of a plot against the Union.<ref name = \"michigan\">See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 341\u2013343.</ref><ref name=\"michigan 2\">See {{harv|Boulard|2006}}, p. 85\u2013100.</ref> Hopkins intended for the ''Tribune'' to make the charges public, at which point Hopkins would admit authorship, thus making the ''Tribune'' editors seem overly partisan and gullible. Instead, the ''Tribune'' editors forwarded the Hopkins letter to government officials. Seward then ordered the arrest of possible \"traitors\" in Michigan, which included Hopkins. Hopkins confessed authorship of the letter and admitted the hoax, but despite this, Seward wrote to Pierce demanding to know if the charges were true. Pierce denied them, and Seward hastily backtracked. Later, Republican newspapers printed the Hopkins letter in spite of his admission that it was a hoax, and Pierce decided that he needed to clear his name publicly. When Seward refused to make their correspondence public, Pierce publicized his outrage by having a Senate ally, California's [[Milton Latham]], read the letters between Seward and Pierce into the Congressional record, to the administration's embarrassment.<ref name = \"michigan\" /><ref name= \"michigan 2\"/>\n\nThe institution of the draft and the arrest of outspoken anti-administration Democrat [[Clement Vallandigham]] further incensed Pierce, who gave an address to New Hampshire Democrats in July 1863 vilifying Lincoln. \"Who, I ask, has clothed the President with power to dictate to any one of us when we must or when we may speak, or be silent upon any subject, and especially in relation to the conduct of any public servant?\", he demanded.<ref name = \"speech\">See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 343\u2013357.</ref><ref name= \"speech2\">See {{harv|Boulard|2006}}, p. 109\u2013123.</ref> Pierce's comments were ill-received in much of the North, especially as his criticism of Lincoln's aims coincided with the twin Union victories at [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]] and [[Siege of Vicksburg|Vicksburg]]. Pierce's reputation in the North was further damaged the following month when the Mississippi plantation of the Confederate president, Jefferson Davis, was seized by Union soldiers. Pierce's correspondence with Davis, all pre-war, revealing his deep friendship with Davis and predicting that civil war would result in insurrection in the North, was sent to the press. Pierce's words hardened abolitionist sentiment against him.<ref name = \"speech\" /><ref name=\"speech2\"/>\n\nJane Pierce died of tuberculosis in Andover, Massachusetts in December 1863; she was buried at Old North Cemetery in Concord, New Hampshire. Pierce was further grieved by the death of his close friend Nathaniel Hawthorne in May 1864; he was with Hawthorne when the author died unexpectedly. Hawthorne had controversially dedicated his final book to Pierce. Some Democrats tried again to put Pierce's name up for consideration as the [[1864 United States presidential election|1864 presidential election]] unfolded, but he kept his distance; Lincoln easily won a second term. When news spread of [[Lincoln's assassination]] in April 1865, a mob gathered outside Pierce's home in Concord, demanding to know why he had not raised a flag as a public mourning gesture. Pierce grew angry, expressing sadness over Lincoln's death but denying any need for a public gesture. He told them that his history of military and public service proved his patriotism, which was enough to quiet the crowd.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 357\u201362.</ref>\n\n===Final years and death===\nPierce's drinking impaired his health in his last years, but he grew increasingly spiritual. He had a brief relationship with an unknown woman in mid-1865. During this time, he used his influence to improve the treatment of Davis, now a prisoner at [[Fort Monroe]] in Virginia. He also offered financial help to Hawthorne's son Julian, as well as to his own nephews. On the second anniversary of Jane's death, Pierce was baptized into his wife's [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] faith at St. Paul's Church in Concord. He found this church to be less political than his former Congregational denomination, which had alienated Democrats with anti-slavery rhetoric. He took up the life of an \"old farmer\", as he called himself, buying up property, drinking less, farming the land himself, and hosting visiting relatives.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 363\u2013366.</ref> He spent most of his time in Concord and his cottage at [[Little Boar's Head Historic District|Little Boar's Head]] on the coast, sometimes visiting Jane's relatives in Massachusetts. Still interested in politics, he expressed support for [[Andrew Johnson]]'s [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] policy and supported the president's acquittal in his [[Impeachment of Andrew Johnson|impeachment trial]]; he later expressed optimism for Johnson's successor, Ulysses S. Grant.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 366\u2013371.</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Death}}\nPierce's health began to decline again in mid-1869; he resumed heavy drinking despite his deteriorating physical condition. He returned to Concord that September, suffering from severe [[cirrhosis]] of the liver, knowing he would not recover. A caretaker was hired; none of his family members were present in his final days. He died at 4:35&nbsp;am on Friday, October 8, 1869. President Grant, who later defended Pierce's service in the Mexican-American War, declared a day of national mourning. Newspapers across the country carried lengthy front-page stories examining Pierce's colorful and controversial career. Pierce was interred next to his wife and two of his sons in the Minot enclosure at Concord's [[Old North Cemetery (Concord, New Hampshire)|Old North Cemetery]].<ref name=\"burial\">See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 369\u2013373.</ref>\n\nIn his last [[will (law)|will]], which he signed January 22, 1868, Pierce left a large number of specific bequests such as paintings, swords, horses, and other items to friends, family, and neighbors. Much of his $72,000 estate (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|72000|1869|r=-4}}}} today) went to his brother Henry's family, and to Hawthorne's children and Pierce's landlady. Henry's son Frank Pierce received the largest share.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 374.</ref>\n\n==Sites, memorials, and honors==\nIn addition to his LL.D. from Norwich University, Pierce also received honorary doctorates from Bowdoin College (1853) and [[Dartmouth College]] (1860).<ref>{{cite book |last= Dartmouth College |date= 1900 |title= General Catalogue |url= https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_sKM4AAAAYAAJ |quote= Franklin Pierce LL.D. dartmouth. |publisher= Dartmouth College |page= [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_sKM4AAAAYAAJ/page/n432 405]|accessdate= August 30, 2014}}</ref>\n\nTwo places in New Hampshire have been listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] specifically because of their association with Pierce.

Norton & Company |location=New York |page=413 |volume=1}}</ref>\n\nBiographer [[Roy Nichols]] argues:\n\n<blockquote>As a national political leader Pierce was an accident. He was honest and tenacious of his views but, as he made up his mind with difficulty and often reversed himself before making a final decision, he gave a general impression of instability. Kind, courteous, generous, he attracted many individuals, but his attempts to satisfy all factions failed and made him many enemies. In carrying out his principles of strict construction he was most in accord with Southerners, who generally had the letter of the law on their side. He failed utterly to realize the depth and the sincerity of Northern feeling against the South and was bewildered at the general flouting of the law and the Constitution, as he described it, by the people of his own New England. At no time did he catch the popular imagination. His inability to cope with the difficult problems that arose early in his administration caused him to lose the respect of great numbers, especially in the North, and his few successes failed to restore public confidence. He was an inexperienced man, suddenly called to assume a tremendous responsibility, who honestly tried to do his best without adequate training or temperamental fitness.<ref>Roy F.

His view of the Constitution and the Union was from the Jacksonian past. He never fully understood the nature or depth of Free Soil sentiment in the North. He was able to negotiate a reciprocal trade treaty with Canada, to begin the opening of Japan to western trade, to add land to the Southwest, and to sign legislation for the creation of an overseas empire [the [[Guano Islands Act]]]. His Cuba and Kansas policies led only to deeper sectional strife. His support for the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act and his determination to enforce the Fugitive Slave Act helped polarize the sections. Pierce was hard-working and his administration largely untainted by graft, yet the legacy from those four turbulent years contributed to the tragedy of secession and civil war.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gara|first=Larry|title=Pierce, Franklin|url=http://www.anb.org/articles/04/04-00788.html|work= American National Biography Online|date=February 2000}}{{subscription}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n== See also ==\n* {{Books-inline|Presidents of the United States (1789\u20131860)}}\n* [[List of New Hampshire historical markers (76\u2013100)#80|New Hampshire Historical Marker No. 80]]: Franklin Pierce 1804\u20131869\n* [[List of deaths through alcohol]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=\"note\"}}\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==== Works cited ====\n{{external media|float=right|video1=[https://www.c-span.org/video/?184075-1/franklin-pierce-new-hampshires-favorite-son ''Booknotes'' interview with Peter Wallner on ''Franklin Pierce: New Hampshire`s Favorite Son'', November 28, 2004], [[C-SPAN]]}}\n{{Refbegin|60em}}\n* {{cite book|ref={{harvid|Boulard|2006}}|last=Boulard|first=Garry|title=The Expatriation of Franklin Pierce: The Story of a President and the Civil War|publisher=iUniverse, Inc.|year=2006|isbn=0-595-40367-0}}\n* {{cite book|ref={{harvid|Butler|1908}}|last=Butler|first=Pierce|year=1908|author-link=Pierce Butler (justice)|title=Judah P.

First broadcast on 16 April 2005 on [[BBC One]], it was written by [[Russell T Davies]] and directed by [[Keith Boak]].  It is the first in a two-part story, concluding with \"[[World War Three (Doctor Who)|World War Three]]\".\n\nThe episode is set in London one year after the 2005 episode \"[[Rose (Doctor Who episode)|Rose]]\". In the episode, the alien crime family the [[Slitheen]] fake a spaceship crash-landing in the [[River Thames]], putting the Earth on high alert. The Slitheen use the crashed spaceship to lure experts of extraterrestrial life including the \"ultimate expert\", the alien [[Time travel in fiction|time traveller]] the [[Ninth Doctor]] ([[Christopher Eccleston]]), into a trap inside [[10 Downing Street]].\n\nThis episode introduced the character of [[Harriet Jones]], played by [[Penelope Wilton]], who would reprise her role in the episodes [[The Christmas Invasion]] and [[The Stolen Earth]]. It also featured an appearance by actress [[Naoko Mori]], who went on to feature in the [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] ''[[Torchwood]]'' as a result of her performance. The Slitheen aliens are part [[Computer-generated imagery|computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) and part [[prosthetic makeup|prosthetic]]/costume. \"Aliens of London\" was watched by seven million viewers on initial broadcast and received generally mixed reviews.\n\n==Plot==\nIntending to return [[Rose Tyler|Rose]] to Earth twelve hours after her original departure, the [[Ninth Doctor]] miscalculates, arriving twelve months after they left. Rose's mother [[Jackie Tyler|Jackie]] is furious with her, believing that Rose had been abducted and murdered. Rose's boyfriend [[Mickey Smith|Mickey]] is also upset, as he was suspected of murdering Rose. As Rose expresses her frustration to the Doctor of not being able, to tell the truth of where she had gone, they witness a spacecraft crash through [[Big Ben]] and fall into the [[River Thames]]. Central London is shut down while the population become excited at the possibility of first contact with an alien species. The Doctor suspects trickery and uses the [[TARDIS]] to land inside the hospital where the alien pilot has been taken. The Doctor discovers that the alien craft was launched from Earth and that the pilot is really a common pig that has been modified by alien technology.\n\nThe government is unable to locate the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] due to the confusion of the crash, and [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|MP]] Joseph Green is named acting Prime Minister. Green is revealed to be a member of the [[Slitheen]], a family of aliens that uses a device to compress their bodies into large human \"suits\" resulting in frequent releases of [[flatulence]]. Two other high members of the government, Margaret Blaine and Oliver Charles are also revealed to be Slitheen. The Slitheen secretly celebrate luring the humans into their plan but are unaware of their conversation being witnessed by [[Harriet Jones]].\n\nWhen the Doctor returns to Rose, Jackie discovers the truth about the Doctor and the TARDIS and calls it in. They are surrounded by soldiers and escorted to [[10 Downing Street]]. The Doctor is asked to join a panel of alien experts including members of [[UNIT]], and Rose is escorted into the building by Harriet. Harriet tells Rose about the aliens, and together they discover the Prime Minister's corpse. Before they can reveal their discovery, they are caught by Blaine, who begins to unzip her human suit to attack them. At Jackie's flat, a police officer also unzips his human suit and attacks Jackie for being associated with the Doctor. As the Doctor attempts to convince the experts of the forgery of the events, the Doctor realises that the experts have been lured to Downing Street together as part of a trap. Green sends an electrical shock through the assembled group.\n\n==Guest cast==\n{{Div col|rules=yes|gap=1em}}\n*[[Camille Coduri]] \u2013 [[Jackie Tyler]]\n*[[Noel Clarke]] \u2013 [[Mickey Smith]]\n*[[Penelope Wilton]] \u2013 [[Harriet Jones]]\n*[[Annette Badland]] \u2013 [[List of Doctor Who villains#Blon Fel-Fotch Pasameer-Day Slitheen|Margaret Blaine]]\n*Corey Doabe \u2013 Spray Painter\n*Ceris Jones \u2013 Policeman\n*[[Jack Tarlton]] \u2013 Tom Hitchingson\n*[[Lachele Carl]] \u2013 [[Trinity Wells]]{{efn|[[Lachele Carl]], the American reporter [[Trinity Wells]], reappears in many invasion stories of the Davies era.<ref>{{cite episode | series = Doctor Who in the U.S. | network = [[BBC]] | station = [[BBC America]] |airdate = 29 September 2012 | credits = [[Lachele Carl]], [[John Barrowman]], [[David Tennant]]}}</ref>}}\n*Fiesta Mei Ling \u2013 Ru\n*Basil Chung \u2013 Bau\n*[[Matt Baker (presenter)|Matt Baker]] \u2013 Himself\n*[[Andrew Marr]] \u2013 Himself\n*[[Rupert Vansittart]] \u2013 [[List of Doctor Who henchmen#\"Oliver Charles\"|General Asquith]]\n*[[David Verrey]] \u2013 [[List of Doctor Who villains#Jocrassa Fel-Fotch Pasameer-Day Slitheen|Joseph Green]]{{efn|[[Rupert Vansittart]] later appeared in the [[Eighth Doctor]] audio drama ''[[Dead London]]'' where he played Sepulchre.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bigfinish.com/21-Doctor-Who-Dead-London|title=Doctor Who&nbsp;\u2014 Dead London|publisher=[[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]]}}</ref>}}\n*[[Navin Chowdhry]] \u2013 Indra Ganesh\n*[[Naoko Mori]] \u2013 [[Toshiko Sato|Doctor Sato]]{{efn|Mori would go on to feature in the spin off torchwood as Toshiko Sato<ref name=SFXannounce>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.sfx.co.uk/news/team_torchwood_expands |title=Team Torchwood expands |magazine=[[SFX (magazine)|SFX]] |last=White |first=James |date=25 April 2006 |accessdate=18 May 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427122618/http://www.sfx.co.uk/news/team_torchwood_expands |archivedate=27 April 2006 }}</ref>}}\n*[[Eric Potts]] \u2013 [[List of Doctor Who henchmen#\"Oliver Charles\"|Oliver Charles]]\n*[[Jimmy Vee]] \u2013 Space Pig\n*[[Steve Speirs]] \u2013 [[List of Doctor Who henchmen#Sip Fel-Fotch Pasameer-Day Slitheen|Strickland]]\n*Elizabeth Fost, [[Paul Kasey]], and [[Alan Ruscoe]] \u2013 [[Slitheen]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Conception===\nInitially, the episode was entitled \"Aliens of London, Part One\".<ref name=\"outpost galifrey\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gallifreyone.com/episode.php?id=2005-04|title=Aliens of London|website=[[Outpost Gallifrey]]|accessdate=15 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702113947/http://www.gallifreyone.com/episode.php?id=2005-04|archive-date=2 July 2007|url-status=live}}</ref>  When writing the episode Russell T Davies was inspired by 1958's British science-fiction serial ''[[Quatermass and the Pit]]''.<ref name=\"10tydk\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbcamerica.com/anglophenia/2016/02/doctor-who-10-things-you-may-not-know-about-aliens-of-london|title=\u2018Doctor Who\u2019: 10 Things You May Not Know About \u2018Aliens of London\u2019|website=[[BBC America]]|last=Mcalpine|first=Fraser|date=2015|accessdate=15 March 2020}}</ref> He was also inspired by [[Paul Cornell]]'s novel ''[[Human Nature (novel)|Human Nature]]'' for the idea of an antagonistic family.<ref name=\"10tydk\" /> Davies decision to have the mobster family slitheen invade downing street was inspired by the girls aloud [[Jump (for My Love)#Girls Aloud version|Jump]] music video which takes place in downing street.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.doctorwho.tv/news/?article=former-doctor-who-boss-girls-aloud-video-was-influence-for-slitheen-invasion|title=Former Doctor Who boss: Girls Aloud video was influence for Slitheen invasion|website=Doctor Who Tv|last=McEwan|first=Cameron|date=September 18, 2017|accessdate=April 4, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe production team had intended to suggest that the murdered Prime Minister in this episode was the current real-life incumbent, [[Tony Blair]].

First broadcast on 16 April 2005 on [[BBC One]], it was written by [[Russell T Davies]] and directed by [[Keith Boak]].  It is the first in a two-part story, concluding with \"[[World War Three (Doctor Who)|World War Three]]\".\n\nThe episode is set in London one year after the 2005 episode \"[[Rose (Doctor Who episode)|Rose]]\". In the episode, the alien crime family the [[Slitheen]] fake a spaceship crash-landing in the [[River Thames]], putting the Earth on high alert. The Slitheen use the crashed spaceship to lure experts of extraterrestrial life including the \"ultimate expert\", the alien [[Time travel in fiction|time traveller]] the [[Ninth Doctor]] ([[Christopher Eccleston]]), into a trap inside [[10 Downing Street]].\n\nThis episode introduced the character of [[Harriet Jones]], played by [[Penelope Wilton]], who would reprise her role in the episodes [[The Christmas Invasion]] and [[The Stolen Earth]]. It also featured an appearance by actress [[Naoko Mori]], who went on to feature in the [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] ''[[Torchwood]]'' as a result of her performance. The Slitheen aliens are part [[Computer-generated imagery|computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) and part [[prosthetic makeup|prosthetic]]/costume. \"Aliens of London\" was watched by seven million viewers on initial broadcast and received generally mixed reviews.\n\n==Plot==\nIntending to return [[Rose Tyler|Rose]] to Earth twelve hours after her original departure, the [[Ninth Doctor]] miscalculates, arriving twelve months after they left. Rose's mother [[Jackie Tyler|Jackie]] is furious with her, believing that Rose had been abducted and murdered. Rose's boyfriend [[Mickey Smith|Mickey]] is also upset, as he was suspected of murdering Rose. As Rose expresses her frustration to the Doctor of not being able, to tell the truth of where she had gone, they witness a spacecraft crash through [[Big Ben]] and fall into the [[River Thames]]. Central London is shut down while the population become excited at the possibility of first contact with an alien species. The Doctor suspects trickery and uses the [[TARDIS]] to land inside the hospital where the alien pilot has been taken. The Doctor discovers that the alien craft was launched from Earth and that the pilot is really a common pig that has been modified by alien technology.\n\nThe government is unable to locate the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] due to the confusion of the crash, and [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|MP]] Joseph Green is named acting Prime Minister. Green is revealed to be a member of the [[Slitheen]], a family of aliens that uses a device to compress their bodies into large human \"suits\" resulting in frequent releases of [[flatulence]]. Two other high members of the government, Margaret Blaine and Oliver Charles are also revealed to be Slitheen. The Slitheen secretly celebrate luring the humans into their plan but are unaware of their conversation being witnessed by [[Harriet Jones]].\n\nWhen the Doctor returns to Rose, Jackie discovers the truth about the Doctor and the TARDIS and calls it in. They are surrounded by soldiers and escorted to [[10 Downing Street]]. The Doctor is asked to join a panel of alien experts including members of [[UNIT]], and Rose is escorted into the building by Harriet. Harriet tells Rose about the aliens, and together they discover the Prime Minister's corpse. Before they can reveal their discovery, they are caught by Blaine, who begins to unzip her human suit to attack them. At Jackie's flat, a police officer also unzips his human suit and attacks Jackie for being associated with the Doctor. As the Doctor attempts to convince the experts of the forgery of the events, the Doctor realises that the experts have been lured to Downing Street together as part of a trap. Green sends an electrical shock through the assembled group.\n\n==Guest cast==\n{{Div col|rules=yes|gap=1em}}\n*[[Camille Coduri]] \u2013 [[Jackie Tyler]]\n*[[Noel Clarke]] \u2013 [[Mickey Smith]]\n*[[Penelope Wilton]] \u2013 [[Harriet Jones]]\n*[[Annette Badland]] \u2013 [[List of Doctor Who villains#Blon Fel-Fotch Pasameer-Day Slitheen|Margaret Blaine]]\n*Corey Doabe \u2013 Spray Painter\n*Ceris Jones \u2013 Policeman\n*[[Jack Tarlton]] \u2013 Tom Hitchingson\n*[[Lachele Carl]] \u2013 [[Trinity Wells]]{{efn|[[Lachele Carl]], the American reporter [[Trinity Wells]], reappears in many invasion stories of the Davies era.<ref>{{cite episode | series = Doctor Who in the U.S. | network = [[BBC]] | station = [[BBC America]] |airdate = 29 September 2012 | credits = [[Lachele Carl]], [[John Barrowman]], [[David Tennant]]}}</ref>}}\n*Fiesta Mei Ling \u2013 Ru\n*Basil Chung \u2013 Bau\n*[[Matt Baker (presenter)|Matt Baker]] \u2013 Himself\n*[[Andrew Marr]] \u2013 Himself\n*[[Rupert Vansittart]] \u2013 [[List of Doctor Who henchmen#\"Oliver Charles\"|General Asquith]]\n*[[David Verrey]] \u2013 [[List of Doctor Who villains#Jocrassa Fel-Fotch Pasameer-Day Slitheen|Joseph Green]]{{efn|[[Rupert Vansittart]] later appeared in the [[Eighth Doctor]] audio drama ''[[Dead London]]'' where he played Sepulchre.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bigfinish.com/21-Doctor-Who-Dead-London|title=Doctor Who&nbsp;\u2014 Dead London|publisher=[[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]]}}</ref>}}\n*[[Navin Chowdhry]] \u2013 Indra Ganesh\n*[[Naoko Mori]] \u2013 [[Toshiko Sato|Doctor Sato]]{{efn|Mori would go on to feature in the spin off torchwood as Toshiko Sato<ref name=SFXannounce>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.sfx.co.uk/news/team_torchwood_expands |title=Team Torchwood expands |magazine=[[SFX (magazine)|SFX]] |last=White |first=James |date=25 April 2006 |accessdate=18 May 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427122618/http://www.sfx.co.uk/news/team_torchwood_expands |archivedate=27 April 2006 }}</ref>}}\n*[[Eric Potts]] \u2013 [[List of Doctor Who henchmen#\"Oliver Charles\"|Oliver Charles]]\n*[[Jimmy Vee]] \u2013 Space Pig\n*[[Steve Speirs]] \u2013 [[List of Doctor Who henchmen#Sip Fel-Fotch Pasameer-Day Slitheen|Strickland]]\n*Elizabeth Fost, [[Paul Kasey]], and [[Alan Ruscoe]] \u2013 [[Slitheen]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Conception===\nInitially, the episode was entitled \"Aliens of London, Part One\".<ref name=\"outpost galifrey\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gallifreyone.com/episode.php?id=2005-04|title=Aliens of London|website=[[Outpost Gallifrey]]|accessdate=15 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702113947/http://www.gallifreyone.com/episode.php?id=2005-04|archive-date=2 July 2007|url-status=live}}</ref>  When writing the episode Russell T Davies was inspired by 1958's British science-fiction serial ''[[Quatermass and the Pit]]''.<ref name=\"10tydk\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbcamerica.com/anglophenia/2016/02/doctor-who-10-things-you-may-not-know-about-aliens-of-london|title=\u2018Doctor Who\u2019: 10 Things You May Not Know About \u2018Aliens of London\u2019|website=[[BBC America]]|last=Mcalpine|first=Fraser|date=2015|accessdate=15 March 2020}}</ref> He was also inspired by [[Paul Cornell]]'s novel ''[[Human Nature (novel)|Human Nature]]'' for the idea of an antagonistic family.<ref name=\"10tydk\" /> Davies decision to have the mobster family slitheen invade downing street was inspired by the girls aloud [[Jump (for My Love)#Girls Aloud version|Jump]] music video which takes place in downing street.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.doctorwho.tv/news/?article=former-doctor-who-boss-girls-aloud-video-was-influence-for-slitheen-invasion|title=Former Doctor Who boss: Girls Aloud video was influence for Slitheen invasion|website=Doctor Who Tv|last=McEwan|first=Cameron|date=September 18, 2017|accessdate=April 4, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe production team had intended to suggest that the murdered Prime Minister in this episode was the current real-life incumbent, [[Tony Blair]].

Arnold T Blumburg of ''[[Now Playing (magazine)|Now Playing]]'' gave the episode a grade of C, finding the Slitheen, their associated humour, and the pig insulting.

He found the problem to be more in the execution than conception; there was a possibility of satire in the fart jokes, but the direction and performances let it down. Because it veered close to being silly and not taking the Slitheen seriously, he argued that the televised version did not display its more nuanced parts, like each Slitheen having individuality, the exploration of the human race knowing about extraterrestrials, and Rose's home life.<ref name=\"AV Club\">{{cite web|first=Alasdair|last=Wilkins|url=http://www.avclub.com/review/aliens-of-londonworld-war-three-106096|title=Doctor Who: \"Aliens of London\"/\"World War Three\"|work=[[The A.V.

Burk noted that the story was \"loved and hated by fans in equal measure\" but it was a \"delight\" for him, though unexpected. While he found the Slitheen to work on many levels of humour, he stated that the domestic storyline was the best part, elevated by good performances. He also felt the pig worked.<ref name=\"burk\">Burk and Smith pp. 20\u201322</ref> Smith called it the closest the new series and Davies \"ever gets to [[pastiche|pastiching]] the Classic Series' most beloved writer, [[Robert Holmes (screenwriter)|Robert Holmes]].\" He also praised the domestic situation, though he found the political satire \"one-note\", the direction disappointing, and Eccleston \"out of his depth\" with lighter moments.<ref name=\"smith?\">Burk and Smith pp. 22\u201323</ref>\n\nThere were minor audience complaints with Rose's remark to the Doctor, \"You're so gay\", generating some controversy.
