Late additions to the fan scene (prior to the publication of ''[[Deathly Hallows]]'') included BeyondHogwarts.com (the successor to DumbledoreIsNotDead.com), which billed itself as \"the only ongoing online Harry Potter fan conference\", as well as Book7.co.uk, which offered a hypothetical \"evidence-based synopsis\" of the seventh novel.

The religion of 'Snapeism' was active from 2005-2011. The Snapists (popularly known as the Snapewives) worshipped the Severus Snape character.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Alderton|first1=Zoe|title='Snapewives' and 'Snapeism': A Fiction-Based Religion within the Harry Potter Fandom|journal=Religions|date=3 March 2014|volume=5|issue=1|pages=219\u2013267|doi=10.3390/rel5010219}}</ref> The Snapists were mocked by the majority of the fandom, especially the JournalFen community 'fandom_wank', for their unorthodox belief systems. Nevertheless, recent scholarship has argued for the validity of fandom faiths.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Davidsen|first1=Markus A.|title=Fiction-Based Religion: Conceptualising a New Category Against History-Based Religion and Fandom|journal=Culture and Religion|volume=14|issue=4|pages=378\u2013395|doi=10.1080/14755610.2013.838798|year=2013|url=https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/48123/Davidsen2013ConceptualisingFiction-basedReligion_Postprint.pdf?sequence=1}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Cusack|first1=Carole|title=Invented Religions: Imagination, Fiction and Faith|date=2010|publisher=Ashgate|location=Farnham}}</ref>\n\nThe Snapists exist within a context of 'canon scepticism' - the belief that Rowling is a flawed interpreter of the Harry Potter universe who misrepresents the objective reality of certain characters and plot developments.<ref name=\"Alderton Snapewives\">{{cite journal|last1=Alderton|first1=Zoe|title='Snapewives' and 'Snapeism': A Fiction-Based Religion within the Harry Potter Fandom|journal=Religions|date=3 March 2014|volume=5|issue=1|page=224|doi=10.3390/rel5010219}}</ref> The Snapists believe that Rowling has misinterpreted Snape and disrespected him as a character. They also feel that Snape can contact them and provide them with help and guidance in life.\n\n==\"Ship debates\"==\n{{further|Shipping (fandom)#Harry Potter fandom}}\nIn the fandom the word \"ship\" and its derivatives like \"shipping\" or \"shipper\" are commonly used as shorthand for the word \"relationship.\"\n\nThe ''Harry Potter'' series generated ship debates with supporters of the prospective relationship between [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] and his close female friend [[Hermione Granger]] at odds with supporters of Hermione ending up instead with [[Ron Weasley]], close friend of both, as well as  supporters of Harry ending up with [[Ginny Weasley]], Ron's younger sister.\n\nQuotes from Rowling which seemed to contradict the possibility of Harry ending up with Hermione were usually countered by claiming them to be deliberate obfuscations designed to lure astute observation off-course (though such claims were far from undisputed, given that these allegedly vague quotes included such phrases as \"[Harry and Hermione] are very platonic friends\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/1999/1099-pressclubtransc.htm |title=1999: Accio Quote!, the largest archive of J.K. Rowling interviews on the web |publisher=Accio-quote.org |date=20 October 1999 |accessdate=16 June 2012}}</ref> and were repeated on at least three different occasions).\n\nAn interview with J.K. Rowling conducted by fansite webmasters Emerson Spartz ([[MuggleNet]]) and Melissa Anelli ([[The Leaky Cauldron (website)|The Leaky Cauldron]]) shortly after the book's release turned out to be quite controversial. During the interview Spartz commented that Harry/Hermione shippers were \"delusional\", to which Rowling chuckled, though making it clear that she did not share the sentiment and that the Harry/Hermione fans were \"still valued members of her readership\". This incident resulted in an uproar among Harry/Hermione shippers. The uproar was loud enough to merit an article in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/08/03/DDG0RE1DDI1.DTL | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | first=Neva | last=Chonin | title=If you're an obsessed Harry Potter fan, Voldemort isn't the problem. It's Hermione versus Ginny | date=24 June 2011}}</ref>\n\nRowling's attitude towards the shipping phenomenon has varied between amused and bewildered to frustrated, as she revealed in that interview. She explained:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2005/0705-tlc_mugglenet-anelli-2.htm |title=2005: Accio Quote!, the largest archive of J.K.

A long time. Occasionally I had to, because there were weird news stories or something that I would have to go and check, because I was supposed to have said something I hadn\u2019t said. I had never gone and looked at fan sites, and then one day I did and oh&nbsp;\u2014 my&nbsp;\u2014 god. Five hours later or something, I get up from the computer shaking slightly [all laugh]. 'What is going on?\u2019 And it was during that first mammoth session that I met the shippers, and it was a most extraordinary thing. I had no idea there was this huge underworld seething beneath me.}}\n\nIn a later posting on MuggleNet, Spartz explained:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mugglenet.com/newsfusion/fullnews.php?id=972 |title=THE INTERVIEW!

You were delusional; you saw what you wanted to see and you have no one to blame for that but yourselves.}}\n\nRowling has continued to make references, less humorous and more, to the severity of the shipper conflicts. In one instance she has joked about trying to think of ways of proving to Emerson, when inviting him for the aforementioned interview, that it was really her and not \"some angry Harry/Hermione shipper trying to lure him down a dark alleyway\";<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=21 |title=Meeting Melissa and Emerson |website=[[J.

She went on to say that perhaps with marriage counseling Ron and Hermione would have been all right.<ref>West, Kelly.

Although not a full [[MMORPG]] format, Chamber of Chat is set up with 3D virtual chatrooms and avatars where fans can socially interact with each other in [[Pictionary]] and Harry Potter [[Trivia]]l games or participate in discussion groups about Harry Potter or Film media or perform plays as a theater group to other fans as audience. They hold special community event such as Harry Potters Birthday or Halloween and have seasonal house competitions.  Fans are able to create their own avatars, collect or be rewarded coins to purchase furniture items for their own \"clubhouse\". However, the website emphasizes more social interaction between fans' avatars to stimulate the Hogwarts student experience. \"Chamber of Chat is a graphical Social Virtual World with a few [[Facebook]] plug-ins.

Interactive gaming can include [[player versus player]] features, a form of currency for making purchases in stores, and [[non-player characters]] such as monsters that must be fought to gain levels and experience points. However, these features are more prevalent in games that are not forum-based. Advancement in such games is usually dependent on live chat, multiplayer cooperation, and fighting as opposed to taking classes or simply posting to earn points for one's \"house\"; like at Hogwarts, players in forum-based games are sometimes sorted into a different group distinguishing different values within a person.\n\nRoleplaying also occurs in [[Improv comedy|long-form improvisational]] theater.

To this end, clues from the earlier books and deliberate hints from [[J. K. Rowling]] (in interviews and on her website) were heavily scrutinised by fans. In particular, fan essays were published on websites such as [[Mugglenet]] (the \"world famous editorials\"), the [[Harry Potter Lexicon]] and [[The Leaky Cauldron (website)|The Leaky Cauldron]] (Scribbulus project) among others: offering theories, comment and analysis on all aspects of the series. The [[Yahoo]] discussion list [[Harry Potter for Grown Ups]] (founded in 1999) is also noteworthy for its detailed criticism and discussion of the Harry Potter books.\n\nSpeculation intensified with the July 2005 publication of ''[[Half-Blood Prince]]'' and the detailed post-publication interview given by Rowling to Mugglenet and The Leaky Cauldron.<ref>{{cite web|author=MuggleNet |url=http://www.mugglenet.com/jkrinterview.shtml |title=Emerson and Melissa's J.K.

Late additions to the fan scene (prior to the publication of ''[[Deathly Hallows]]'') included BeyondHogwarts.com (the successor to DumbledoreIsNotDead.com), which billed itself as \"the only ongoing online Harry Potter fan conference\", as well as Book7.co.uk, which offered a hypothetical \"evidence-based synopsis\" of the seventh novel.

The religion of 'Snapeism' was active from 2005-2011. The Snapists (popularly known as the Snapewives) worshipped the Severus Snape character.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Alderton|first1=Zoe|title='Snapewives' and 'Snapeism': A Fiction-Based Religion within the Harry Potter Fandom|journal=Religions|date=3 March 2014|volume=5|issue=1|pages=219\u2013267|doi=10.3390/rel5010219}}</ref> The Snapists were mocked by the majority of the fandom, especially the JournalFen community 'fandom_wank', for their unorthodox belief systems.

They also feel that Snape can contact them and provide them with help and guidance in life.\n\n==\"Ship debates\"==\n{{further|Shipping (fandom)#Harry Potter fandom}}\nIn the fandom the word \"ship\" and its derivatives like \"shipping\" or \"shipper\" are commonly used as shorthand for the word \"relationship.\"\n\nThe ''Harry Potter'' series generated ship debates with supporters of the prospective relationship between [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] and his close female friend [[Hermione Granger]] at odds with supporters of Hermione ending up instead with [[Ron Weasley]], close friend of both, as well as  supporters of Harry ending up with [[Ginny Weasley]], Ron's younger sister.\n\nQuotes from Rowling which seemed to contradict the possibility of Harry ending up with Hermione were usually countered by claiming them to be deliberate obfuscations designed to lure astute observation off-course (though such claims were far from undisputed, given that these allegedly vague quotes included such phrases as \"[Harry and Hermione] are very platonic friends\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/1999/1099-pressclubtransc.htm |title=1999: Accio Quote!, the largest archive of J.K.

Rowling conducted by fansite webmasters Emerson Spartz ([[MuggleNet]]) and Melissa Anelli ([[The Leaky Cauldron (website)|The Leaky Cauldron]]) shortly after the book's release turned out to be quite controversial. During the interview Spartz commented that Harry/Hermione shippers were \"delusional\", to which Rowling chuckled, though making it clear that she did not share the sentiment and that the Harry/Hermione fans were \"still valued members of her readership\". This incident resulted in an uproar among Harry/Hermione shippers. The uproar was loud enough to merit an article in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/08/03/DDG0RE1DDI1.DTL | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | first=Neva | last=Chonin | title=If you're an obsessed Harry Potter fan, Voldemort isn't the problem. It's Hermione versus Ginny | date=24 June 2011}}</ref>\n\nRowling's attitude towards the shipping phenomenon has varied between amused and bewildered to frustrated, as she revealed in that interview. She explained:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2005/0705-tlc_mugglenet-anelli-2.htm |title=2005: Accio Quote!, the largest archive of J.K.

Although not a full [[MMORPG]] format, Chamber of Chat is set up with 3D virtual chatrooms and avatars where fans can socially interact with each other in [[Pictionary]] and Harry Potter [[Trivia]]l games or participate in discussion groups about Harry Potter or Film media or perform plays as a theater group to other fans as audience. They hold special community event such as Harry Potters Birthday or Halloween and have seasonal house competitions.  Fans are able to create their own avatars, collect or be rewarded coins to purchase furniture items for their own \"clubhouse\". However, the website emphasizes more social interaction between fans' avatars to stimulate the Hogwarts student experience. \"Chamber of Chat is a graphical Social Virtual World with a few [[Facebook]] plug-ins.

Interactive gaming can include [[player versus player]] features, a form of currency for making purchases in stores, and [[non-player characters]] such as monsters that must be fought to gain levels and experience points. However, these features are more prevalent in games that are not forum-based. Advancement in such games is usually dependent on live chat, multiplayer cooperation, and fighting as opposed to taking classes or simply posting to earn points for one's \"house\"; like at Hogwarts, players in forum-based games are sometimes sorted into a different group distinguishing different values within a person.\n\nRoleplaying also occurs in [[Improv comedy|long-form improvisational]] theater. Several American and British improv troupes are devoted to the Potter genre.
