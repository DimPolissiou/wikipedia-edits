It was commissioned by Huseyn Ali Khan, the [[Erivan Khanate|khan of Erivan]]. It is one of the oldest extant structures in [[Kentron District|central Yerevan]] and the most significant structure from the city's [[Iranian Armenia (1502\u20131828)|Iranian period]]. It was the largest of the eight mosques of Yerevan in the 19th century and is today the only active mosque in Armenia.\n\nThe mosque was secularized in the 1920s and housed the [[History Museum of Yerevan]] for more than five decades. Following Armenia's independence, the mosque was renovated with the support from the Iranian government and again started operating as a mosque, serving the Iranians residing in Yerevan.\n\n==Names==\nWestern visitors in the Russian period, such as [[H.

Its courtyard became a \"creative space for Armenian artists, writers, poets, and intelligentsia, facilitating the production of a new cultural and aesthetic order for socialist Armenia.

It is one of the oldest extant structures in [[Kentron District|central Yerevan]] and the most significant structure from the city's [[Iranian Armenia (1502\u20131828)|Iranian period]]. It was the largest of the eight mosques of Yerevan in the 19th century and is today the only active mosque in Armenia.\n\nThe mosque was secularized in the 1920s and housed the [[History Museum of Yerevan]] for more than five decades.

The length of study is three to five years, and the completed degree is designated as a [[bachelor of technology]], or a [[bachelor of engineering]]. The curriculum generally includes classes in physics, mathematics, [[project management]], design and specific topics in civil engineering. After taking basic courses in most sub-disciplines of civil engineering, they move on to specialize in one or more sub-disciplines at advanced levels. While an undergraduate degree (BEng/BSc) normally provides successful students with industry-accredited qualification, some academic institutions offer post-graduate degrees (MEng/MSc), which allow students to further specialize in their particular area of interest.<ref name=\"CITE Postgrad\">,{{cite web|url=http://www.uel.ac.uk/cite/programmes/postgraduate/index.htm|title=Cite Postgrad|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081106121950/http://www.uel.ac.uk/cite/programmes/postgraduate/index.htm|archive-date=2008-11-06|url-status=dead}}</ref>[[File:Tkkstudentsbackinthedays.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.15|Surveying students with professor at the [[Helsinki University of Technology]] in the late 19th century.]]\n\n== Practicing engineers ==\nIn most countries, a bachelor's degree in engineering represents the first step towards [[professional certification]], and a [[professional body]] certifies the degree program. After completing a certified degree program, the engineer must satisfy a range of requirements including work experience and exam requirements before being certified. Once certified, the engineer is designated as a [[professional engineer]] (in the United States, Canada and South Africa), a [[chartered engineer]] (in most [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries), a chartered professional engineer (in Australia and [[New Zealand]]), or a European engineer (in most countries of the [[European Union]]). There are international agreements between relevant professional bodies to allow engineers to practice across national borders.\n\nThe benefits of certification vary depending upon location. For example, in the United States and Canada, \"only a licensed [[professional engineer]] may prepare, sign and seal, and submit engineering plans and drawings to a public authority for approval, or seal engineering work for public and private clients.\"<ref>{{cite web | title = Why Should You Get Licensed? | work = National Society of Professional Engineers | url = http://www.nspe.org/lc1-why.asp | accessdate = 11 August 2007 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050604085233/http://www.nspe.org/lc1-why.asp | archivedate = 4 June 2005 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> This requirement is enforced under provincial law such as the Engineers Act in [[Quebec]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Engineers Act | work = Quebec Statutes and Regulations (CanLII) | url = http://www.canlii.org/qc/laws/sta/i-9/20050616/whole.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061005184956/http://www.canlii.org/qc/laws/sta/i-9/20050616/whole.html | url-status = dead | archive-date = 5 October 2006 | accessdate = 11 August 2007 }}</ref> No such legislation has been enacted in other countries including the United Kingdom.

General civil engineers work closely with surveyors and specialized civil engineers to design grading, drainage, [[Pavement (material)|pavement]], water supply, sewer service, dams, electric and communications supply. General civil engineering is also referred to as site engineering, a branch of civil engineering that primarily focuses on converting a tract of land from one usage to another. Site engineers spend time visiting project sites, meeting with stakeholders, and preparing construction plans. Civil engineers apply the principles of geotechnical engineering, structural engineering, environmental engineering, transportation engineering and construction engineering to residential, commercial, industrial and public works projects of all sizes and levels of construction.\n\n===Coastal engineering===\n{{Main|Coastal engineering|Coastal management}}\n[[File:Oosterscheldekering, Netherlands.JPG|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Oosterscheldekering]], a [[storm surge barrier]] in the Netherlands.]]\n''Coastal engineering'' is concerned with managing coastal areas. In some jurisdictions, the terms sea defense and coastal protection mean defense against flooding and erosion, respectively. The term coastal defense is the more traditional term, but coastal management has become more popular as the field has expanded to techniques that allow erosion to claim land.\n\n===Construction engineering===\n{{Main|Construction engineering}}\n''Construction engineering'' involves planning and execution, transportation of materials, site development based on hydraulic, environmental, structural and geotechnical engineering. As construction firms tend to have higher business risk than other types of civil engineering firms do, construction engineers often engage in more business-like transactions, for example, drafting and reviewing contracts, evaluating [[Logistics|logistical operations]], and monitoring prices of supplies.\n\n===Earthquake engineering===\n{{Main|Earthquake engineering}}\n''Earthquake engineering'' involves designing structures to withstand hazardous earthquake exposures. Earthquake engineering is a sub-discipline of structural engineering. The main objectives of earthquake engineering are<ref>Chen W-F, Scawthorn C. Earthquake Engineering Handbook, CRC Press, 2003, {{ISBN|0-8493-0068-1}}, Chapter 2</ref> to understand interaction of structures on the shaky ground; foresee the consequences of possible earthquakes; and design, construct and maintain structures to [[seismic performance|perform]] at earthquake in compliance with [[building code]]s.\n\n===Environmental engineering===\n{{Main|Environmental engineering}}\n[[File:Water pollution.jpg|right|thumbnail|upright=1.15|Water pollution]]\n''Environmental engineering'' is the contemporary term for [[sanitary engineering]], though sanitary engineering traditionally had not included much of the hazardous waste management and environmental remediation work covered by environmental engineering. Public health engineering and environmental health engineering are other terms being used.\n\nEnvironmental engineering deals with treatment of chemical, biological, or thermal wastes, purification of water and air, and [[Environmental remediation|remediation]] of contaminated sites after waste disposal or accidental contamination. Among the topics covered by environmental engineering are pollutant transport, [[water purification]], [[waste water treatment]], air pollution, [[Waste management|solid waste treatment]], [[recycling]], and [[hazardous waste|hazardous waste management]]. Environmental engineers administer pollution reduction, [[green engineering]], and [[industrial ecology]]. Environmental engineers also compile information on environmental consequences of proposed actions.\n\n===Forensic engineering===\n{{Main|Forensic engineering}}\n''Forensic engineering'' is the investigation of materials, [[Product (business)|products]], structures or components that fail or do not operate or function as intended, causing personal injury or damage to property. The consequences of failure are dealt with by the law of product liability. The field also deals with retracing processes and procedures leading to accidents in operation of vehicles or machinery. The subject is applied most commonly in civil law cases, although it may be of use in criminal law cases. Generally the purpose of a Forensic engineering investigation is to locate cause or causes of failure with a view to improve performance or life of a component, or to assist a court in determining the facts of an accident. It can also involve investigation of intellectual property claims, especially [[patent]]s.\n\n===Geotechnical engineering===\n{{Main|Geotechnical engineering}}\n[[File:Soil-phase-diagram.svg|thumb|A phase diagram of soil indicating the weights and volumes of air, soil, water, and voids.]]\n''Geotechnical engineering'' studies rock and soil supporting civil engineering systems. Knowledge from the field of [[soil science]], materials science, [[mechanics]], and [[hydraulics]] is applied to safely and economically design [[foundation (engineering)|foundations]], [[retaining wall]]s, and other structures. Environmental efforts to protect [[groundwater]] and safely maintain landfills have spawned a new area of research called geoenvironmental engineering.<ref name=\"mitchell\">Mitchell, James Kenneth (1993), Fundamentals of Soil Behavior (2nd ed.), John Wiley and Sons, pp 1\u20132</ref><ref>Shroff, Arvind V.; Shah, Dhananjay L.

[[Boundary condition]]s are often well defined in other branches of civil engineering, but unlike steel or concrete, the material properties and behavior of soil are difficult to predict due to its variability and limitation on [[geotechnical investigation|investigation]]. Furthermore, soil exhibits nonlinear ([[stress (physics)|stress]]-dependent) [[shear strength (soil)|strength]], stiffness, and dilatancy (volume change associated with application of shear stress), making studying [[soil mechanics]] all the more difficult.<ref name=\"mitchell\"/> Geotechnical engineers frequently work with professional [[geologists]] and soil scientists.<ref>{{cite web |title=Geotechnical/Geological Engineering |url=https://www.ausimm.com.au/content/docs/careers_booklet_geotgeoleng.pdf |website=Professional Careers in the Mineral Industry |publisher=The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy |accessdate=30 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Materials science and engineering===\n{{Main|Materials science}}\n''Materials science'' is closely related to civil engineering. It studies fundamental characteristics of materials, and deals with ceramics such as concrete and mix asphalt concrete, strong metals such as aluminum and steel, and [[thermosetting polymer]]s including [[polymethylmethacrylate]] (PMMA) and carbon fibers.\n\n''Materials engineering'' involves protection and prevention (paints and finishes). Alloying combines two types of metals to produce another metal with desired properties. It incorporates elements of [[applied physics]] and [[chemistry]]. With recent media attention on [[nanoscience]] and [[nanotechnology]], materials engineering has been at the forefront of academic research. It is also an important part of forensic engineering and [[failure analysis]].\n\n===Structural engineering===\n{{Main|Structural engineering}}\n[[File:Burj Dubai Evolution.ogv|right|thumb|[[Burj Khalifa]] animation of construction process|thumbtime=0:23]]\n[[File:Construcci\u00f3n de una cimentaci\u00f3n por zapata aislada.ogv|thumb|left|[[Shallow foundation]] construction example]]\n''Structural engineering'' is concerned with the [[structural design]] and [[structural analysis]] of buildings, bridges, [[tower]]s, [[overpass|flyovers]] (overpasses), tunnels, off shore structures like oil and gas fields in the sea, [[aerostructure]] and other structures. This involves identifying the loads which act upon a structure and the forces and stresses which arise within that structure due to those loads, and then designing the structure to successfully support and resist those loads. The loads can be self weight of the structures, other dead load, live loads, moving (wheel) load, wind load, earthquake load, load from temperature change etc. The structural engineer must design structures to be safe for their users and to successfully fulfill the function they are designed for (to be ''serviceable''). Due to the nature of some loading conditions, sub-disciplines within structural engineering have emerged, including [[wind engineering]] and earthquake engineering.<ref>Narayanan, R, A Beeby. ''Introduction to Design for Civil Engineers''. London: Spon, 2003.</ref>\n\nDesign considerations will include strength, stiffness, and stability of the structure when subjected to loads which may be static, such as furniture or self-weight, or dynamic, such as wind, seismic, crowd or vehicle loads, or transitory, such as temporary construction loads or impact. Other considerations include cost, constructability, safety, aesthetics and [[sustainability]].\n\n===Surveying===\n{{Main|Surveying|Construction surveying}}\n[[File:Student using a dumpy level.jpg|thumb|A student using a [[dumpy level]]]]\n''Surveying'' is the process by which a surveyor measures certain dimensions that occur on or near the surface of the Earth. Surveying equipment such as levels and theodolites are used for accurate measurement of angular deviation, horizontal, vertical and slope distances. With computerisation, electronic distance measurement (EDM), total stations, GPS surveying and laser scanning have to a large extent supplanted traditional instruments. Data collected by survey measurement is converted into a graphical representation of the Earth's surface in the form of a map. This information is then used by civil engineers, contractors and realtors to design from, build on, and trade, respectively. Elements of a structure must be sized and positioned in relation to each other and to site boundaries and adjacent structures. \n\nAlthough surveying is a distinct profession with separate qualifications and licensing arrangements, civil engineers are trained in the basics of surveying and mapping, as well as [[geographic information system]]s. Surveyors also lay out the routes of railways, [[tramway track]]s, highways, roads, pipelines and streets as well as position other infrastructure, such as [[harbor]]s, before construction.\n\n;Land surveying\n\nIn the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and most Commonwealth countries land surveying is considered to be a separate and distinct profession. [[Surveying#Land surveyor|Land surveyors]] are not considered to be engineers, and have their own professional associations and licensing requirements. The services of a licensed land surveyor are generally required for boundary surveys (to establish the boundaries of a parcel using its legal description) and subdivision plans (a plot or map based on a survey of a parcel of land, with boundary lines drawn inside the larger parcel to indicate the creation of new boundary lines and roads), both of which are generally referred to as [[Cadastral surveying]].[[File:Bureau of Land Management Cadastral Survey Marker Arizona.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|[[Bureau of Land Management|BLM]] [[cadastral]] survey marker from 1992 in [[San Xavier, Arizona]].]]\n\n;Construction surveying\nConstruction surveying is generally performed by specialised technicians. Unlike land surveyors, the resulting plan does not have legal status. Construction surveyors perform the following tasks:\n* Surveying existing conditions of the future work site, including topography, existing buildings and infrastructure, and underground infrastructure when possible;\n* \"lay-out\" or \"setting-out\": placing reference points and markers that will guide the construction of new structures such as roads or buildings;\n* Verifying the location of structures during construction;\n* As-Built surveying: a survey conducted at the end of the construction project to verify that the work authorized was completed to the specifications set on plans.\n\n===Transportation engineering===\n{{Main|Transportation engineering}}''Transportation engineering'' is concerned with moving people and goods efficiently, safely, and in a manner conducive to a vibrant community. This involves specifying, designing, constructing, and maintaining transportation infrastructure which includes streets, canals, highways, [[rail transport|rail systems]], airports, ports, and [[mass transit]]. It includes areas such as transportation design, [[transportation planning]], [[traffic engineering (transportation)|traffic engineering]], some aspects of [[municipal or urban engineering|urban engineering]], [[queueing theory]], [[pavement engineering]], [[Intelligent Transportation System]] (ITS), and infrastructure management.\n\n===Municipal or urban engineering===\n[[File:Old Market Roundabout, Bristol.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|The engineering of this [[roundabout]] in [[Bristol]], England, attempts to make traffic flow free-moving]]\n{{Main|Urban engineering}}\n[[File:LagoMenorChapultepec3.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Lake [[Chapultepec]]]]\n''Municipal engineering'' is concerned with municipal infrastructure. This involves specifying, designing, constructing, and maintaining streets, [[sidewalk]]s, [[municipal water supply|water supply networks]], sewers, [[street light]]ing, [[municipal solid waste]] management and disposal, storage depots for various bulk materials used for maintenance and public works (salt, sand, etc.), [[urban park|public parks]] and [[cycling infrastructure]]. In the case of underground [[public utility|utility]] networks, it may also include the civil portion (conduits and access chambers) of the local distribution networks of electrical and telecommunications services. It can also include the optimizing of waste collection and [[public transport bus service|bus service]] networks. Some of these disciplines overlap with other civil engineering specialties, however municipal engineering focuses on the coordination of these infrastructure networks and services, as they are often built simultaneously, and managed by the same municipal authority.  Municipal engineers may also design the site civil works for large buildings, industrial plants or campuses (i.e. access roads, parking lots, potable water supply, treatment or pretreatment of waste water, site drainage, etc.)\n\n===Water resources engineering===\n{{See also|Hydraulic engineering|Hydrology}}\n[[File:Hoover dam from air.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hoover Dam]] ]]\n''Water resources engineering'' is concerned with the collection and management of water (as a [[natural resource]]). As a discipline it therefore combines elements of hydrology, environmental science, [[meteorology]], [[water conservation|conservation]], and [[resource management]]. This area of civil engineering relates to the prediction and management of both the quality and the quantity of water in both underground ([[aquifer]]s) and above ground (lakes, rivers, and streams) resources. Water resource engineers analyze and model very small to very large areas of the earth to predict the amount and content of water as it flows into, through, or out of a facility. Although the actual design of the facility may be left to other engineers.\n\n''Hydraulic engineering'' is concerned with the flow and conveyance of fluids, principally water. This area of civil engineering is intimately related to the design of [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]], [[water supply network]], drainage facilities (including bridges, dams, [[Channel (geography)|channels]], [[culvert]]s, [[levee]]s, [[storm sewer]]s), and canals. Hydraulic engineers design these facilities using the concepts of [[fluid pressure]], [[fluid statics]], [[fluid dynamics]], and hydraulics, among others.[[File:FalkirkWheelSide 2004 SeanMcClean.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The [[Falkirk Wheel]] in Scotland]]\n\n===Civil engineering systems===\nCivil engineering systems is a discipline that promotes the use of systems thinking to manage complexity and change in civil engineering within its wider public context. It posits that the proper development of civil engineering [[infrastructure]] requires a [[Holism|holistic]], coherent understanding of the relationships between all of the important factors that contribute to successful projects while at the same time emphasising the importance of attention to technical detail. Its purpose is to help integrate the entire civil engineering [[Project management|project life cycle]] from conception, through planning, designing, making, operating to decommissioning.<ref>[https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Introduction+to+Civil+Engineering+Systems%3A+A+Systems+Perspective+to+the+Development+of+Civil+Engineering+Facilities-p-9780470530634 Samuel Labi ''Introduction to Civil Engineering Systems: A Systems Perspective to the Development of Civil Engineering Facilities''] 2014, John Wiley{{ISBN|978-0-470-53063-4}} Retrieved May 2018</ref><ref>[http://www.icebookshop.com/bookshop_main.asp?ISBN=9780727760821 David Blockley and Patrick Godfrey ''Doing it Differently: Systems for Rethinking Infrastructure (2nd Edition)''] ICE Publications, London {{ISBN|978-0-7277-6082-1}}\" Retrieved May 2018</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Engineering}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Architectural engineering]]\n* [[Civil engineering software]]\n* [[Engineering drawing]]\n* [[Glossary of civil engineering]]\n* [[Index of civil engineering articles]]\n* [[List of civil engineers]]\n* [[List of engineering branches]]\n* [[List of Historic Civil Engineering Landmarks]]\n* [[Macro-engineering]]\n* [[Railway engineering]]\n* [[Site survey]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n=== Associations ===\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[American Society of Civil Engineers]]\n* [[Canadian Society for Civil Engineering]]\n* [[Chartered Institution of Civil Engineering Surveyors]]\n* [[Colegio de Ingenieros de Caminos Canales y Puertos (CICCP)]]\n* [[Earthquake Engineering Research Institute]]\n* [[Engineers Australia]]\n* [[European Federation of National Engineering Associations]]\n* [[FIDIC|International Federation of Consulting Engineers]]\n* [[Indian Geotechnical Society]]\n* [[Institution of Civil Engineers]]\n* [[Institution of Structural Engineers]]\n* [[Institute of Engineering]] (Nepal)\n* [[International Society of Soil Mechanics and Geotechnical Engineering]]\n* [[Institution of Engineers, Bangladesh]]\n* [[Institution of Engineers (India)]]\n* [[Institution of Engineers of Ireland]]\n* [[Institute of Transportation Engineers]]\n* [[Japan Society of Civil Engineers (JSCE)]]\n* [[Pakistan Engineering Council]]\n* [[Philippine Institute of Civil Engineers]]\n* [[Transportation Research Board]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book|title=The Civil Engineering Handbook|isbn=978-0-8493-0958-8|publisher=CRC Press|editor=W.F.

Because civil engineering is a wide-ranging profession, including several specialized sub-disciplines, its history is linked to knowledge of structures, materials science, geography, geology, [[soil]]s, [[hydrology]], [[environmental science|environment]], [[mechanics]] and other fields.\n\nThroughout ancient and medieval history most architectural design and construction was carried out by [[artisan]]s, such as [[masonry|stonemasons]] and [[carpenter]]s, rising to the role of [[Architect|master builder]]. Knowledge was retained in [[guild]]s and seldom supplanted by advances.

The earliest practice of civil engineering may have commenced between 4000 and 2000 BC in [[ancient Egypt]], the [[Indus Valley Civilization]], and [[Mesopotamia]] (ancient Iraq) when humans started to abandon a [[nomad]]ic existence, creating a need for the construction of shelter.

The length of study is three to five years, and the completed degree is designated as a [[bachelor of technology]], or a [[bachelor of engineering]]. The curriculum generally includes classes in physics, mathematics, [[project management]], design and specific topics in civil engineering. After taking basic courses in most sub-disciplines of civil engineering, they move on to specialize in one or more sub-disciplines at advanced levels. While an undergraduate degree (BEng/BSc) normally provides successful students with industry-accredited qualification, some academic institutions offer post-graduate degrees (MEng/MSc), which allow students to further specialize in their particular area of interest.<ref name=\"CITE Postgrad\">,{{cite web|url=http://www.uel.ac.uk/cite/programmes/postgraduate/index.htm|title=Cite Postgrad|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081106121950/http://www.uel.ac.uk/cite/programmes/postgraduate/index.htm|archive-date=2008-11-06|url-status=dead}}</ref>[[File:Tkkstudentsbackinthedays.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.15|Surveying students with professor at the [[Helsinki University of Technology]] in the late 19th century.]]\n\n== Practicing engineers ==\nIn most countries, a bachelor's degree in engineering represents the first step towards [[professional certification]], and a [[professional body]] certifies the degree program. After completing a certified degree program, the engineer must satisfy a range of requirements including work experience and exam requirements before being certified. Once certified, the engineer is designated as a [[professional engineer]] (in the United States, Canada and South Africa), a [[chartered engineer]] (in most [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries), a chartered professional engineer (in Australia and [[New Zealand]]), or a European engineer (in most countries of the [[European Union]]). There are international agreements between relevant professional bodies to allow engineers to practice across national borders.\n\nThe benefits of certification vary depending upon location.

General civil engineers work closely with surveyors and specialized civil engineers to design grading, drainage, [[Pavement (material)|pavement]], water supply, sewer service, dams, electric and communications supply. General civil engineering is also referred to as site engineering, a branch of civil engineering that primarily focuses on converting a tract of land from one usage to another. Site engineers spend time visiting project sites, meeting with stakeholders, and preparing construction plans.

Earthquake Engineering Handbook, CRC Press, 2003, {{ISBN|0-8493-0068-1}}, Chapter 2</ref> to understand interaction of structures on the shaky ground; foresee the consequences of possible earthquakes; and design, construct and maintain structures to [[seismic performance|perform]] at earthquake in compliance with [[building code]]s.\n\n===Environmental engineering===\n{{Main|Environmental engineering}}\n[[File:Water pollution.jpg|right|thumbnail|upright=1.15|Water pollution]]\n''Environmental engineering'' is the contemporary term for [[sanitary engineering]], though sanitary engineering traditionally had not included much of the hazardous waste management and environmental remediation work covered by environmental engineering. Public health engineering and environmental health engineering are other terms being used.\n\nEnvironmental engineering deals with treatment of chemical, biological, or thermal wastes, purification of water and air, and [[Environmental remediation|remediation]] of contaminated sites after waste disposal or accidental contamination. Among the topics covered by environmental engineering are pollutant transport, [[water purification]], [[waste water treatment]], air pollution, [[Waste management|solid waste treatment]], [[recycling]], and [[hazardous waste|hazardous waste management]]. Environmental engineers administer pollution reduction, [[green engineering]], and [[industrial ecology]]. Environmental engineers also compile information on environmental consequences of proposed actions.\n\n===Forensic engineering===\n{{Main|Forensic engineering}}\n''Forensic engineering'' is the investigation of materials, [[Product (business)|products]], structures or components that fail or do not operate or function as intended, causing personal injury or damage to property. The consequences of failure are dealt with by the law of product liability. The field also deals with retracing processes and procedures leading to accidents in operation of vehicles or machinery. The subject is applied most commonly in civil law cases, although it may be of use in criminal law cases. Generally the purpose of a Forensic engineering investigation is to locate cause or causes of failure with a view to improve performance or life of a component, or to assist a court in determining the facts of an accident. It can also involve investigation of intellectual property claims, especially [[patent]]s.\n\n===Geotechnical engineering===\n{{Main|Geotechnical engineering}}\n[[File:Soil-phase-diagram.svg|thumb|A phase diagram of soil indicating the weights and volumes of air, soil, water, and voids.]]\n''Geotechnical engineering'' studies rock and soil supporting civil engineering systems. Knowledge from the field of [[soil science]], materials science, [[mechanics]], and [[hydraulics]] is applied to safely and economically design [[foundation (engineering)|foundations]], [[retaining wall]]s, and other structures. Environmental efforts to protect [[groundwater]] and safely maintain landfills have spawned a new area of research called geoenvironmental engineering.<ref name=\"mitchell\">Mitchell, James Kenneth (1993), Fundamentals of Soil Behavior (2nd ed.), John Wiley and Sons, pp 1\u20132</ref><ref>Shroff, Arvind V.; Shah, Dhananjay L. (2003), Soil Mechanics and Geotechnical Engineering, Taylor & Francis, 2003, pp 1\u20132</ref>\n\nIdentification of soil properties presents challenges to geotechnical engineers. [[Boundary condition]]s are often well defined in other branches of civil engineering, but unlike steel or concrete, the material properties and behavior of soil are difficult to predict due to its variability and limitation on [[geotechnical investigation|investigation]]. Furthermore, soil exhibits nonlinear ([[stress (physics)|stress]]-dependent) [[shear strength (soil)|strength]], stiffness, and dilatancy (volume change associated with application of shear stress), making studying [[soil mechanics]] all the more difficult.<ref name=\"mitchell\"/> Geotechnical engineers frequently work with professional [[geologists]] and soil scientists.<ref>{{cite web |title=Geotechnical/Geological Engineering |url=https://www.ausimm.com.au/content/docs/careers_booklet_geotgeoleng.pdf |website=Professional Careers in the Mineral Industry |publisher=The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy |accessdate=30 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Materials science and engineering===\n{{Main|Materials science}}\n''Materials science'' is closely related to civil engineering. It studies fundamental characteristics of materials, and deals with ceramics such as concrete and mix asphalt concrete, strong metals such as aluminum and steel, and [[thermosetting polymer]]s including [[polymethylmethacrylate]] (PMMA) and carbon fibers.\n\n''Materials engineering'' involves protection and prevention (paints and finishes). Alloying combines two types of metals to produce another metal with desired properties. It incorporates elements of [[applied physics]] and [[chemistry]]. With recent media attention on [[nanoscience]] and [[nanotechnology]], materials engineering has been at the forefront of academic research. It is also an important part of forensic engineering and [[failure analysis]].\n\n===Structural engineering===\n{{Main|Structural engineering}}\n[[File:Burj Dubai Evolution.ogv|right|thumb|[[Burj Khalifa]] animation of construction process|thumbtime=0:23]]\n[[File:Construcci\u00f3n de una cimentaci\u00f3n por zapata aislada.ogv|thumb|left|[[Shallow foundation]] construction example]]\n''Structural engineering'' is concerned with the [[structural design]] and [[structural analysis]] of buildings, bridges, [[tower]]s, [[overpass|flyovers]] (overpasses), tunnels, off shore structures like oil and gas fields in the sea, [[aerostructure]] and other structures. This involves identifying the loads which act upon a structure and the forces and stresses which arise within that structure due to those loads, and then designing the structure to successfully support and resist those loads. The loads can be self weight of the structures, other dead load, live loads, moving (wheel) load, wind load, earthquake load, load from temperature change etc. The structural engineer must design structures to be safe for their users and to successfully fulfill the function they are designed for (to be ''serviceable''). Due to the nature of some loading conditions, sub-disciplines within structural engineering have emerged, including [[wind engineering]] and earthquake engineering.<ref>Narayanan, R, A Beeby. ''Introduction to Design for Civil Engineers''. London: Spon, 2003.</ref>\n\nDesign considerations will include strength, stiffness, and stability of the structure when subjected to loads which may be static, such as furniture or self-weight, or dynamic, such as wind, seismic, crowd or vehicle loads, or transitory, such as temporary construction loads or impact. Other considerations include cost, constructability, safety, aesthetics and [[sustainability]].\n\n===Surveying===\n{{Main|Surveying|Construction surveying}}\n[[File:Student using a dumpy level.jpg|thumb|A student using a [[dumpy level]]]]\n''Surveying'' is the process by which a surveyor measures certain dimensions that occur on or near the surface of the Earth. Surveying equipment such as levels and theodolites are used for accurate measurement of angular deviation, horizontal, vertical and slope distances. With computerisation, electronic distance measurement (EDM), total stations, GPS surveying and laser scanning have to a large extent supplanted traditional instruments. Data collected by survey measurement is converted into a graphical representation of the Earth's surface in the form of a map. This information is then used by civil engineers, contractors and realtors to design from, build on, and trade, respectively. Elements of a structure must be sized and positioned in relation to each other and to site boundaries and adjacent structures. \n\nAlthough surveying is a distinct profession with separate qualifications and licensing arrangements, civil engineers are trained in the basics of surveying and mapping, as well as [[geographic information system]]s. Surveyors also lay out the routes of railways, [[tramway track]]s, highways, roads, pipelines and streets as well as position other infrastructure, such as [[harbor]]s, before construction.\n\n;Land surveying\n\nIn the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and most Commonwealth countries land surveying is considered to be a separate and distinct profession. [[Surveying#Land surveyor|Land surveyors]] are not considered to be engineers, and have their own professional associations and licensing requirements. The services of a licensed land surveyor are generally required for boundary surveys (to establish the boundaries of a parcel using its legal description) and subdivision plans (a plot or map based on a survey of a parcel of land, with boundary lines drawn inside the larger parcel to indicate the creation of new boundary lines and roads), both of which are generally referred to as [[Cadastral surveying]].[[File:Bureau of Land Management Cadastral Survey Marker Arizona.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|[[Bureau of Land Management|BLM]] [[cadastral]] survey marker from 1992 in [[San Xavier, Arizona]].]]\n\n;Construction surveying\nConstruction surveying is generally performed by specialised technicians. Unlike land surveyors, the resulting plan does not have legal status. Construction surveyors perform the following tasks:\n* Surveying existing conditions of the future work site, including topography, existing buildings and infrastructure, and underground infrastructure when possible;\n* \"lay-out\" or \"setting-out\": placing reference points and markers that will guide the construction of new structures such as roads or buildings;\n* Verifying the location of structures during construction;\n* As-Built surveying: a survey conducted at the end of the construction project to verify that the work authorized was completed to the specifications set on plans.\n\n===Transportation engineering===\n{{Main|Transportation engineering}}''Transportation engineering'' is concerned with moving people and goods efficiently, safely, and in a manner conducive to a vibrant community. This involves specifying, designing, constructing, and maintaining transportation infrastructure which includes streets, canals, highways, [[rail transport|rail systems]], airports, ports, and [[mass transit]]. It includes areas such as transportation design, [[transportation planning]], [[traffic engineering (transportation)|traffic engineering]], some aspects of [[municipal or urban engineering|urban engineering]], [[queueing theory]], [[pavement engineering]], [[Intelligent Transportation System]] (ITS), and infrastructure management.\n\n===Municipal or urban engineering===\n[[File:Old Market Roundabout, Bristol.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|The engineering of this [[roundabout]] in [[Bristol]], England, attempts to make traffic flow free-moving]]\n{{Main|Urban engineering}}\n[[File:LagoMenorChapultepec3.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Lake [[Chapultepec]]]]\n''Municipal engineering'' is concerned with municipal infrastructure. This involves specifying, designing, constructing, and maintaining streets, [[sidewalk]]s, [[municipal water supply|water supply networks]], sewers, [[street light]]ing, [[municipal solid waste]] management and disposal, storage depots for various bulk materials used for maintenance and public works (salt, sand, etc.), [[urban park|public parks]] and [[cycling infrastructure]]. In the case of underground [[public utility|utility]] networks, it may also include the civil portion (conduits and access chambers) of the local distribution networks of electrical and telecommunications services. It can also include the optimizing of waste collection and [[public transport bus service|bus service]] networks. Some of these disciplines overlap with other civil engineering specialties, however municipal engineering focuses on the coordination of these infrastructure networks and services, as they are often built simultaneously, and managed by the same municipal authority.  Municipal engineers may also design the site civil works for large buildings, industrial plants or campuses (i.e. access roads, parking lots, potable water supply, treatment or pretreatment of waste water, site drainage, etc.)\n\n===Water resources engineering===\n{{See also|Hydraulic engineering|Hydrology}}\n[[File:Hoover dam from air.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hoover Dam]] ]]\n''Water resources engineering'' is concerned with the collection and management of water (as a [[natural resource]]). As a discipline it therefore combines elements of hydrology, environmental science, [[meteorology]], [[water conservation|conservation]], and [[resource management]]. This area of civil engineering relates to the prediction and management of both the quality and the quantity of water in both underground ([[aquifer]]s) and above ground (lakes, rivers, and streams) resources. Water resource engineers analyze and model very small to very large areas of the earth to predict the amount and content of water as it flows into, through, or out of a facility. Although the actual design of the facility may be left to other engineers.\n\n''Hydraulic engineering'' is concerned with the flow and conveyance of fluids, principally water. This area of civil engineering is intimately related to the design of [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]], [[water supply network]], drainage facilities (including bridges, dams, [[Channel (geography)|channels]], [[culvert]]s, [[levee]]s, [[storm sewer]]s), and canals. Hydraulic engineers design these facilities using the concepts of [[fluid pressure]], [[fluid statics]], [[fluid dynamics]], and hydraulics, among others.[[File:FalkirkWheelSide 2004 SeanMcClean.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The [[Falkirk Wheel]] in Scotland]]\n\n===Civil engineering systems===\nCivil engineering systems is a discipline that promotes the use of systems thinking to manage complexity and change in civil engineering within its wider public context. It posits that the proper development of civil engineering [[infrastructure]] requires a [[Holism|holistic]], coherent understanding of the relationships between all of the important factors that contribute to successful projects while at the same time emphasising the importance of attention to technical detail. Its purpose is to help integrate the entire civil engineering [[Project management|project life cycle]] from conception, through planning, designing, making, operating to decommissioning.<ref>[https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Introduction+to+Civil+Engineering+Systems%3A+A+Systems+Perspective+to+the+Development+of+Civil+Engineering+Facilities-p-9780470530634 Samuel Labi ''Introduction to Civil Engineering Systems: A Systems Perspective to the Development of Civil Engineering Facilities''] 2014, John Wiley{{ISBN|978-0-470-53063-4}} Retrieved May 2018</ref><ref>[http://www.icebookshop.com/bookshop_main.asp?ISBN=9780727760821 David Blockley and Patrick Godfrey ''Doing it Differently: Systems for Rethinking Infrastructure (2nd Edition)''] ICE Publications, London {{ISBN|978-0-7277-6082-1}}\" Retrieved May 2018</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Engineering}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Architectural engineering]]\n* [[Civil engineering software]]\n* [[Engineering drawing]]\n* [[Glossary of civil engineering]]\n* [[Index of civil engineering articles]]\n* [[List of civil engineers]]\n* [[List of engineering branches]]\n* [[List of Historic Civil Engineering Landmarks]]\n* [[Macro-engineering]]\n* [[Railway engineering]]\n* [[Site survey]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n=== Associations ===\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[American Society of Civil Engineers]]\n* [[Canadian Society for Civil Engineering]]\n* [[Chartered Institution of Civil Engineering Surveyors]]\n* [[Earthquake Engineering Research Institute]]\n* [[Engineers Australia]]\n* [[European Federation of National Engineering Associations]]\n* [[FIDIC|International Federation of Consulting Engineers]]\n* [[Indian Geotechnical Society]]\n* [[Institution of Civil Engineers]]\n* [[Institution of Structural Engineers]]\n* [[Institute of Engineering]] (Nepal)\n* [[International Society of Soil Mechanics and Geotechnical Engineering]]\n* [[Institution of Engineers, Bangladesh]]\n* [[Institution of Engineers (India)]]\n* [[Institution of Engineers of Ireland]]\n* [[Institute of Transportation Engineers]]\n* [[Pakistan Engineering Council]]\n* [[Philippine Institute of Civil Engineers]]\n* [[Transportation Research Board]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book|title=The Civil Engineering Handbook|isbn=978-0-8493-0958-8|publisher=CRC Press|editor=W.F.
