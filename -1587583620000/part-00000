Dino is a relatively small dinosaur, only slightly larger than the humans of his time, smaller than [[mammoth]]s that appear in the series, and much smaller than the numerous sauropods that appear as work animals in the series (a full-sized sauropod appears as a crane in the opening sequence, and oversized \"[[Brontosaurus|bronto]] ribs\" the size of an automobile are seen in the closing credits).\n\nA recurring gag in the series is Fred coming home from work, and Dino gets excited and knocks him down and licks his face. But no matter how hard he tries to the contrary, Fred usually gives in to Dino's ticklish and wet doglike kisses. Dino frequently exhibits human emotions, nearly \"talking,\" and can also be moved to anger, at which point he snarls and snaps, especially when Fred tries to lie either to or in front of him, which he can always tell. He also loves to play with [[Pebbles Flintstone|Pebbles]] and [[Bamm-Bamm Rubble|Bamm-Bamm]], the Flintstones' and Rubbles' respective offspring; these characters are introduced in the middle part of the series. In the episode \"Hop Happy\" Dino meets Hoppy, the Rubbles' new pet hopperoo. At first, Dino and Fred get scared, thinking he's a giant mouse, but they eventually become best friends after Hoppy helps Dino rescue their owners in an accident.\n\nAlthough he is usually immune, Dino does take a couple of brief stabs at romance.  The first comes in the episode, \"Dino Goes Hollyrock\", which originally aired on September 14, 1962.  In it, Dino falls in love with female TV star sauropod \"Sassie\" (an obvious takeoff on \"[[Lassie (1954 TV series)|Lassie]]\") and then becomes her co-star on her TV show.  However, after she removes her false eyelashes and wig, he is shocked that she turned out to be an ugly, talented sauropod that could be beautified.  The second comes in the episode, \"Dino and Juliet\", which originally aired on November 26, 1964.  In it, Dino falls in love with the new neighbor's female sauropod (Juliet).  Their romance, which results in the birth of 15 puppies, helps end the feud between Fred and the new neighbor, Mr. Loudrock.\n\nAlthough Dino had already appeared earlier in the series' first season (such as the episode \"No Help Wanted\" and \"Arthur Quarry's Dance Class\" - these episodes were made after the \"Snorkasaurus Hunter\" but aired before), Dino is portrayed quite differently in the first season's 18th episode \"The Snorkasaurus Hunter.\" In this episode, Fred and his friend [[Barney Rubble]] are on a camping trip, trying to hunt a snorkasaurus. Unlike Dino's other appearances, the snorkasaurus in this episode speaks and behaves toward Fred and Barney in a manner similar to comedian [[Phil Silvers]]. At the end of the episode, the Flintstones take in the dinosaur; the snorkasaurus (called \"Dino\" at one point by Wilma) is seen acting like a butler for the Flintstones: answering the telephone, dusting, and ironing. Dino in this episode also has purple skin instead of his varying pink-to-red color, which seems to vary from episode-to-episode during this early period, but is permanently purple after this episode. After this episode, Dino is permanently portrayed as behaving in a doglike fashion.<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0580278/</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.topthat.net/webrock/faq/faq10.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513034318/http://www.topthat.net/webrock/faq/faq10.htm |archivedate=2012-05-13 }}</ref>\n\nDino's origins are explained in the episode \"Dino Disappears\", which originally aired on October 10, 1963.  In it, Wilma states that Dino followed Fred home because Fred was playing with him.  Fred counters by saying he was merely trying to chase him away. This seems to refer to the episode \"Snorkasaurus Hunter\" where Fred and Barney's playing was actually hunting him down and Dino's following him was actually Dino sneaking onto the car.\n\nPost-original series, Dino appears in most of the series' spin-offs, except during the first season of ''[[The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show]]''. There, Dino is replaced by Wooly, a dwarf mammoth, as the Flintstone family's pet. However, starting with the following series ''[[The Flintstone Comedy Hour]]'', Dino once again becomes a regular character.\n\nIn the 1980-1982 series ''[[The Flintstone Comedy Show]]'', Dino is featured in his own segment, \"[[The Flintstone Comedy Show (1980 TV series)#Dino and Cavemouse|Dino and Cavemouse]],\" where Dino tries futilely to capture a pesky [[mouse]] in the Flintstone household. The segments bear some similarities to classic cat-and-mouse cartoons such as ''[[Tom and Jerry]]''.\n\nDino later appears as a puppy in 1986-1988 series ''[[The Flintstone Kids]]'' (including his own segment, \"Dino's Dilemmas\"), as Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm's babysitter in the short-lived 1996 series ''[[Cave Kids]]'', and also starred in his own two 7-minute short cartoons, ''[[Dino: Stay Out!]]'' (1995) and ''[[Dino: The Great Egg-Scape]]'' (1997).\n\nIn 2020, Dino is featured in the new series ''[[Yabba-Dabba Dinosaurs]]''. Similar to ''[[Cave Kids]]'', the show focuses on the lives of Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm, who are joined by Dino for many adventures in the Stone Age.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Amidi |first1=Amid |title=Boomerang Announces 2 New Streaming Series: \u2018Yabba-Dabba Dinosaurs!\u2019 and \u2018Scooby-Doo And Guess Who?\u2019 |url=https://www.cartoonbrew.com/internet-television/boomerang-announces-2-new-streaming-series-yabba-dabba-dinosaurs-and-scooby-doo-and-guess-who-158604.html |accessdate=16 March 2020 |work=Cartoon Brew |date=May 24, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Other media==\n[[File:Dino Harikalar Diyari Flintstones 06029 nevit.jpg|thumbnail|right|Dino statue (right), along with [[Fred Flintstone]] (left).]]\nDino appears in both live-action movies.

Fred won Dino's egg as a prize after winning a carnival game. Initially, Fred didn't think much of the egg as he felt that the creatures inside never live long. On a [[Ferris wheel]], just as Fred and Wilma are about to kiss, Dino's egg hatches and he takes an immediate attachment to Fred, believing him to be his mother.

Her work reflects certain recurring themes such as nature, magic, faith and redemption, and often references visual art.\n\n== Background ==\nMarly Youmans grew up in [[Louisiana]], [[North Carolina]], and elsewhere. She currently lives in the village of [[Cooperstown, New York]], with her husband and three children. She graduated from [[Hollins College]], [[Brown University]], and [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]].

Across all these idioms, her work displays a commitment to rhythm, the sound of words, imagery and complexity of form and allusion. ''Thaliad'', for example, is an epic poem that tells a compelling story of children who survive an apocalypse to begin a new society, written as though a spoken history remembranced in blank verse a generation on.

Sarkar seems to question all objectivity in art, to approach the work as such, the expression of a search.[In his works] We see the misuse of motives, a short prosodic structure, a dry recitative and a rhythmic pattern constitutive of an intimate rumination, the effect of distancing and the search for an intimate cohesion.<ref name=\"News from Africa\">{{cite web | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181217063554/https://news.africa/2017/10/page/497/| title= News Africa| publisher= Le Mauricien |year=2017 | accessdate=16 October 2017}}</ref>}}\nIn an interview for Arty Legume, he had indicated his principal poetic influences to be [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], [[Arthur Rimbaud]] & [[Sylvia Plath]], who taught him, poetic restraint and the 'economy of balance'.\n\nSarkar refuses to be labelled as an artist and remarks that 'there is an inherent difference between craftsmanship and artistry' and instead prefers to be called a 'technician, who picks up the pen or brush to accomplish the job.

The reflexive space, the powerful creations are not synonymous with anarchy. It is about safeguarding the autonomy of artistic creation and affirming a critical attitude towards the present world. Sarkar seems to question all objectivity in art, to approach the work as such, the expression of a search.[In his works] We see the misuse of motives, a short prosodic structure, a dry recitative and a rhythmic pattern constitutive of an intimate rumination, the effect of distancing and the search for an intimate cohesion.<ref name=\"News from Africa\">{{cite web | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181217063554/https://news.africa/2017/10/page/497/| title= News Africa| publisher= Le Mauricien |year=2017 | accessdate=16 October 2017}}</ref>}}\nIn an interview for Arty Legume, he had indicated his principal poetic influences to be [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], [[Arthur Rimbaud]] & [[Sylvia Plath]], who taught him, poetic restraint and the 'economy of balance'.\n\nSarkar refuses to be labelled as an artist and remarks that 'there is an inherent difference between craftsmanship and artistry' and instead prefers to be called a 'technician, who picks up the pen or brush to accomplish the job.

It is located in the [[Aburr\u00e1 Valley]], a central region of the [[Andes Mountains]] in South America. According to the [[National Administrative Department of Statistics (Colombia)|National Administrative Department of Statistics]], the city had an estimated population of 2,427,129 according to the 2018 census.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> With its surrounding area that includes nine other cities, the [[Metropolitan Area of Medell\u00edn|metropolitan area of Medell\u00edn]] is the second-largest urban agglomeration in Colombia in terms of population and economy, with more than 3.7 million people.\n\nIn 1616 the Spaniard Francisco Herrera Campuzano erected a small indigenous village (\"''poblado''\") known as \"[[Lawrence of Rome|Saint Lawrence]] of Aburr\u00e1\" (''San Lorenzo de Aburr\u00e1''), located in the present-day [[El Poblado (Medell\u00edn)|El Poblado]] commune. On 2 November 1675, the [[queen consort]] [[Mariana of Austria]] founded the \"Town of [[Virgin of Candelaria|Our Lady of Candelaria]] of Medell\u00edn\" (''Villa de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Candelaria de Medell\u00edn'') in the An\u00e1 region, which today corresponds to the center of the city (east-central zone) and first describes the region as \"Medell\u00edn\". In 1826, the city was named the capital of the [[Department of Antioquia]] by the National Congress of the nascent [[Republic of Gran Colombia]], comprised by present-day Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, and Panama. After Colombia won its independence from Spain, Medell\u00edn became the capital of the Federal State of Antioquia until 1888, with the proclamation of the [[Colombian Constitution of 1886]]. During the 19th century, Medell\u00edn was a dynamic commercial center, first exporting gold, then producing and exporting coffee.\n\nAt the beginning of the 21st century, the city regained industrial dynamism, with the construction of the [[Medell\u00edn Metro]] commuter rail, liberalized development policies, improved security and improved education. Researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] have lauded the city as a pioneer of a post-[[Washington consensus]] \"[[Developmental state#Local Developmental State|local development state]]\" model of economic development.<ref name=ODI1>Milford Bateman, Juan Pablo Duran Ort\u00edz and Kate Maclean 2010.

Count Pedro Portocarrero y Luna, President of the Council for the West Indies (''Consejo de Indias''), asked the [[Monarchy|Spanish monarchy]] to give the name of his town, Medell\u00edn in Extremadura, to the new settlement in America. His request was accepted on November 22, 1674, when the [[Regent]] Mariana of Austria proclaimed the city's name to be ''Villa de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Medell\u00edn''. Miguel Aguinaga y Mendiogoitia, Governor, made the name official on November 2, 1675.

He sent Jer\u00f3nimo Luis Tejelo to explore the territory, and during the night of August 23, Tejelo reached the plain of what is now Aburr\u00e1 Valley. The Spaniards gave it the name of \"Valley of [[Bartholomew the Apostle|Saint Bartholomew]]\", but this was soon changed for the native name ''Aburr\u00e1'', meaning \"Painters\", due to the textile decorations of the local chief-men.<ref name=\"restrepo\">Restrepo Uribe, Jorge (1981), Medell\u00edn, su Origen, Progreso y Desarrollo, Servigr\u00e1ficas, Medell\u00edn. {{ISBN|84-300-3286-X}}.</ref>\n\nIn 1574, Gaspar de Rodas asked the [[Department of Antioquia|Antioquia's]] [[Cabildo (council)|Cabildo]] for {{convert|4|mi2|km2|order=flip|0|sp=us}} of land to establish herds and a ranch in the valley. The Cabildo granted him {{convert|3|mi2|km2|order=flip|0|sp=us}} of land.<ref name=\"restrepo\"/>\n\nIn 1616, the colonial visitor Francisco de Herrera y Campuzano founded a settlement with 80 Amerindians, naming it ''Poblado de San Lorenzo'', today \"[[El Poblado, Medell\u00edn|El Poblado]]\". In 1646 a colonial law ordered the separation of Amerindians from [[mestizo]]s and [[mulatto]]s, so the colonial administration began the construction of a new town in An\u00e1, today [[Berr\u00edo Park]], where the church of ''Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Candelaria de An\u00e1'' (\"Our Lady of Candelaria of An\u00e1\") was built. Three years later, the Spaniards started the construction of the [[Basilica of Our Lady of Candelaria]], which was rebuilt at the end of the 18th century.<ref name=\"restrepo\"/>\n\n===Growth of the town===\n[[File:Catedral de Medell\u00edn-Fachada P.jpg|240px|left|thumbnail|[[Metropolitan Cathedral of Medell\u00edn]].]]\n\nAfter 1574, with Gaspar de Rodas settled in the valley, the population started to grow. According to the church records of the San Lorenzo Church, six couples married between 1646 and 1650, and 41 between 1671 and 1675.<ref name=\"restrepo\"/> Gold mines were developed northeast of Antioquia, thus they needed food supply from nearby agriculture. The Aburr\u00e1 Valley was in a strategic position between the gold mines and the first provincial capital of Antioquia, [[Santa Fe de Antioquia]].<ref name=\"restrepo\"/>\n\nThe provincial capital, Santa Fe, started to lose importance and gradually became poor, as trade and prominent personalities of the region came to the Aburr\u00e1 Valley, where rich families started to buy land. Soon, the first settlers asked for the creation of a [[Cabildo (council)]] in the valley, thus getting a separate government from Santa Fe.<ref name=\"restrepo\"/> The Santa Fe government fought this, but Mariana of Austria signed the edict creating the Cabildo on November 22, 1674. The governor Miguel de Aguinaga proclaimed the royal edict on 2 November 1675. The new city was given the title of ''Villa de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Candelaria''.<ref name=\"restrepo\"/>\n\n===During the Spanish colonial period===\n[[File:Plano de Medellin 1791.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Map of Medell\u00edn in 1791.]]\n\nBefore the creation of the town, the inhabitants were scattered throughout the valley, with only a few families concentrated at the confluence of the An\u00e1 (today called the [[Santa Elena River|Santa Elena]]) and the [[Medell\u00edn River|Medell\u00edn]] rivers; others lived in El Poblado San Lorenzo. After the royal edict, the settlers chose the An\u00e1 site as the heart of the future city, with the Candelaria Church at its center. {{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n[[File:2018 Medell\u00edn iglesia de San Ignacio.jpg|thumbnail|253x253px|San Ignacio Church, an example of colonial architecture in Colombia.]]\n\nTheir first buildings were simple, with [[Thatching|thatched]] roofs. The houses of the most important people were two stories tall, and the church and the Cabildo were unimpressive. It was only during the 18th century that the church was improved. Only one story, the Cabildo was located at the western part of the plaza. It had a thatched roof until 1742 when tiles were put on. In 1682, traders and foreigners started the construction of the [[Iglesia de la Veracruz (Medell\u00edn)|Veracruz Hermitage]], which was consecrated as a church by the Bishop of [[Popay\u00e1n]] in 1712.<ref name=\"restrepo\"/>\n\nIn 1675, the first census during colonial times was taken: there were 3,000 people and 280 families. Another census was not taken until the colonial Visitador (royal inspector) [[Antonio Mon y Velarde]] ordered one between 1786 and 1787: there were then 14,507 people and 241 families. In 1808, two years before Colombia won independence, the city had 15,347 people and 360 families.<ref name=\"restrepo\"/>\n\nIn 1803, the Royal College of the Franciscans was founded in the Central Plaza, which is [[Berr\u00edo Park]] today, with the initial departments of Grammar, Philosophy, and Theology.<ref>'\"Suramericana de Seguros\", in ''History of Antioquia,'' Ed. Presencia Ltda, Medell\u00edn, 1988, without ISBN, in Spanish.</ref> Soon after, the college moved to a new building in the small San Ignacio square. In 1821 it was renamed Colegio de Antioquia, and it became the [[University of Antioquia]] in 1901. The University also had the first vocational training school, the first cultural radio station in Latin America, and the first regional [[botanical garden]].\n\n===Industrial revolution===\nIn the first half of the twentieth century, the population of Medell\u00edn increased sixfold, from 59,815 inhabitants in 1905 to 358,189 in 1951. The [[Thousand Days War]] (1899\u20131902) stopped the industrial development of the city, although the civil war did not affect the region directly. Under reforms by President [[Rafael Reyes]] after the conflict, the city continued its industrial development<ref name=\"restrepo\"/> and founded a [[Chamber of commerce]].  The Chamber developed a regional transport project that connected Medell\u00edn to other Colombian regions and other nations.\n\nDespite the importance of gold production in the early development of Medell\u00edn, the export of coffee contributed the most impetus in the 20th century for the city's growth. Trade grew to international dimensions as the main export of Colombia became [[Coffee production in Colombia|coffee]]. The industrial and commercial dynamism of Medell\u00edn also created a caste of traders and entrepreneurs, who founded the first nationwide industries in Colombia.<ref name=\"restrepo\"/>\n\n===Trade in Medell\u00edn===\n[[File:Parque Berr\u00edo Medell\u00edn.jpg|upright|thumb|right|190px|[[Coltejer Building]], the tallest building in Medell\u00edn.]]\n[[Coltejer]] is one of the most important textile companies in Colombia.

The Antioquia Railway (built in 1875) conquered the difficult geography of one of the most mountainous regions of South America, notably with the [[La Quiebra Tunnel]], which connected the industrial center to the [[Magdalena River]], the most major navigable river in Colombia. In 1932 Medell\u00edn also built its first airport, the [[Enrique Olaya Herrera Airport]].<ref name=\"restrepo\" />\n\nThe study by Charles H. Savage on industrial production in Antioquia between 1960 and 1972 showed how important Medell\u00edn industries became to Colombia and South America. He studied social change produced by the introduction of new technology. Savage looked at three factories in Antioquia: two potteries in [[Santuario]] and [[La Blanca (Colombia)|La Blanca]], and a tailoring factory in Medell\u00edn. Savage studied the production of the Antioquian factories, and the relationship between the workers and their employers, an industrial efficiency which he called the \"Culture of Work\".<ref>Savage presented his thesis ''Factories in the Andes: Social Organization in a Developing Economy'' for his PhD in Business Administration at [[Harvard University]] in 1962.</ref> His conclusions were published by his colleague [[George F.

The [[University of Antioquia]], the [[National University of Colombia]] with its Medell\u00edn branch, and the [[Pontifical Bolivarian University]] have historically been the academic centers of the city and are responsible for the formation of an intellectual class in the region.\n\nDuring the first part of the 20th century, the city was part of the literary transition from [[romanticism]] to the modern art and literary movements of the new century. {{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} The writer [[Tom\u00e1s Carrasquilla]] (1858\u20131940)  focused on the people of his native Antioquia, portraying their daily lives and customs.

Other featured poets and writers were [[Porfirio Barba-Jacob]] and [[Efe G\u00f3mez]]. In painting, the most famous were [[Eladio V\u00e9lez]] and [[Pedro Nel G\u00f3mez]]. [[Carlos Vieco Ortiz]] was a popular composer and musician. Medell\u00edn became the headquarters of record labels like Sonolux, Ondina and Silver.<ref name=\"restrepo\"/>\n\nMedell\u00edn clubs, many of them dating to the end of the 19th century became a center for intellectual and industrialist movements, like Club Union (founded in 1894) and Club Campestre (founded in 1924). In 1909 the Circo Espa\u00f1a was created, and Bol\u00edvar Theater, in 1919. The Jun\u00edn Theater was demolished to build the [[Coltejer Tower]].

[[Paul Lester Wiener]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Sert]] were the architects who led the project. Among the main features of the MMP were the canalization of the [[Medell\u00edn River]], the control of new settlements on valley slopes, the creation of an industrial zone in the Guayabal District, the planning of the city to be in harmony with the river, the construction of a city stadium, and an administrative center in [[La Alpujarra Administrative Center|La Alpujarra]].<ref name=\"restrepo\"/>\n\nIn 1951 the city had 358,189 inhabitants, but 22 years later, in 1973, the population had tripled to 1,071,252.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalurban.org/GUDMag07Vol3Iss1/Betancur.htm|title=Approaches to the Regularization of Informal Settlements: the case of primed in Medell\u00edn, Colombia|publisher=Global Urban Development Magazine (Volume 3, Issue 1)|author=John J.

The urban limits of the city grew to areas that were not contemplated in the MMP, so that Medell\u00edn now reached the urban areas of other cities of the Aburr\u00e1 Valley, like [[Envigado]], [[Bello, Antioquia|Bello]] and [[Itag\u00fc\u00ed]]; the new Medell\u00edn settlers were poor families without enough credit to buy their own homes, so several neighborhoods were built beyond the MMP; several old downtown buildings were demolished to construct tall towers, offices, and avenues.\n\nIn 1968 the Second Conference of CELAM was held in Medellin expessing a [[preferential option for the poor]]. The traditional Junin Theatre along the Santa Elena was demolished to build the Coltejer Tower. The huge migration into Medell\u00edn provided workers for the expansion of textile factories, being modernized in this period,<ref name=\"restrepo\"/> but it also created new problems for the city: higher unemployment, lack of services for poor areas, urban violence in several districts, and collapse of any hope of a transport system. {{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n===Today===\n[[File:Medellin sightseeing.jpg|alt=|thumb|240x240px|View of Medell\u00edn at night]]\nThe position of Medell\u00edn as the second industrial city in Colombia has been the main factor in overcoming its crisis of the 1980s and 1990s. The [[Medell\u00edn Metro]], a massive urban transport service, became the pride of the city, and so far the only sign of the Medell\u00edn Master Plan of the 1950s. The construction of the [[Plaza Mayor, Medell\u00edn|Plaza Mayor of Medell\u00edn]], an international center for congresses and expositions, was designed to showcase the [[Globalization|globalized]] economy of Colombia to the world.\n\nSocial exclusion has eased due to the development of a transport infrastructure; the Metro, a new system of public buses, is being planned with the so-called \"Metroplus\", already inaugurated, and gondolas called \u201cMetroCable\u201d in the poorest barrio communities.<ref name=ODI1/> Additionally, an electric escalator 1,260 feet long was inaugurated on December 26, 2011, in Comuna 13, one of Medell\u00edn's poorest neighborhoods, making it one of the first of its kind in the world.

North of the valley are the towns of [[Bello, Antioquia|Bello]], [[Copacabana, Antioquia|Copacabana]], [[Girardota]] and [[Barbosa, Antioquia|Barbosa]]. To the south of the valley lie [[Itag\u00fc\u00ed]], [[Envigado]], [[Sabaneta, Antioquia|Sabaneta]], [[La Estrella, Colombia|La Estrella]] and [[Caldas, Antioquia|Caldas]].\n\n===Climate===\nThe weather in Medell\u00edn is warm year-round with few temperature extremes. As a municipality, Medell\u00edn has an area of {{convert|382|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.  Medell\u00edn features a trade-wind [[tropical rainforest climate]] (''Af''), albeit a noticeably cooler version of this climate that borders closely on a [[subtropical highland climate]] (''Cfb'') and also on a [[tropical monsoon climate]] (''Am''). Because Medell\u00edn is located at {{convert|1500|m|-2|abbr=on}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]], its climate is not as hot as other cities located at the same latitude near the equator. Because of its altitude [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] and privileged location in the Andes Range, Medell\u00edn's weather at times is more characteristic of a [[humid subtropical climate]] than that of a [[tropical climate]]. The city's average annual temperature is {{convert|22|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}, and because of its proximity to the equator, its temperature is constant year-round, with minimal temperature variations. Temperatures range from {{convert|15|to|30|C|F|abbr=on}}. Because of the pleasant springlike climate all year, Medell\u00edn is known as \"La Ciudad de la Eterna Primavera\" or \"City of the Eternal Spring\". However, as the city is located in a valley and many of its districts are on slopes, temperatures can be slightly cooler on the surrounding mountains.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Medell\u00edn

Medell\u00edn retains very little colonial architecture from the nineteenth century. Although the Aburr\u00e1 Valley was a hotspot in agriculture and livestock throughout the colonial period, their relative wealth is not expressed in an outstanding and Cartagena, Tunja, Popay\u00e1n and Bogot\u00e1 civil and religious architecture. This can be explained by the fact that the population of Medell\u00edn was not political and administrative center and a place geographically isolated whose elite invested little in the development of monumental architecture. From the end of the colony remain, but with many transformations, the Candelaria Church and the Church of the Veracruz.\n\n[[File:2018 Medell\u00edn fachada de la iglesia de La Veracruz.jpg|thumb|The Church of the Veracruz remains, but with many transformations, from the end of the colonial period.]]\nThe architecture produced in Colombia between 1850 and 1930 is called \"Republican\". The use of brick and implementation of European historical styles were the main novelty. Enrique Haeusler designed the Guayaquil Bridge in 1879. But it was the French architect Carlos Carr\u00e9 who headlined Republican nineteenth century architecture in Medell\u00edn. Carr\u00e9 came to town in 1889 and was hired to design and build the new Episcopal Cathedral and several commercial and residential buildings for different parts of the city, especially in the new neighborhood of Guayaquil. The Metropolitan Cathedral was completed in 1931; also are of authorship V\u00e1squez and Carr\u00e9 buildings, which are located next to [[Plaza Cisneros]]. The Medell\u00edn Antioquia Railway Station was the work of Enrique Olarte, a work that allowed the definitive urban consolidation in Guayaquil sector. In the twenties Republican architecture reached its peak phase. In this period stand the old Municipal Palace (now the Museum of Antioquia) in 1928, the National Palace and the Palace of Departmental Government (now the Palace of Culture) between 1925 and 1928. The latter two works were designed by the Belgian architect [[Agust\u00edn Goovaerts]], both inspired by the Belgian modernist, it applied the Romanesque and Gothic styles respectively. Other works of Goovaerts were the Church of the Sacred Heart (sector Guayaquil), the Church of San Ignacio, among others. The thirties highlighted such constructions of the Prado neighborhood as the Egyptian house and the current Teatro Prado.\n\n===Parks===\nThe main parks of the city include [[Berr\u00edo Park]] in the center of the city; [[Bol\u00edvar Park (Medell\u00edn, Colombia)|Bol\u00edvar Park]], a little further north and framed by the Metropolitan Cathedral; and others in more residential areas like Bethlehem Park, El Poblado Park, and Laureles Park. Several modern parks are interactive and have had a positive reception from the people because they are not only places of recreation but also of education. These include Barefoot Park, Wishes Park, [[Explora Park]], and Bicentennial Park (which was recently opened to mark the bicentenary of Colombia).\n\nOne of the most visited sites is the [[Arv\u00ed Ecotourism Park]], which has an area of about 20,000 hectares, covers virtually the entire territory of the village of [[Santa Elena (Medell\u00edn)|Santa Elena]], and runs between the towns of [[Bello, Antioquia|Bello]], [[Copacabana, Antioquia|Copacabana]], and [[Envigado]]. In its trails, lakes, forests and streams, one can practice various sports and activities like trekking, kayaking, biking, camping, fishing, swimming, sailing rowing, horseback riding, bike tours and picnics. Its promontory position over Medell\u00edn offers natural landscapes overlooking over the entire city. {{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nThe city is surrounded from above by seven hills, which serve as natural viewpoints of the city and are sites for healthy leisure, recreation, enjoyment, research, sport, culture, education and ecotourism. The hills are El Volador, La Asomadera, [[Nutibara Hill|Nutibara]], Pan de Az\u00facar, El Salvador, El Picacho and Santo Domingo. In these natural public spaces one can find viewpoints, pre-Hispanic roads, religious icons, culture and Antioquian traditions, bird watching, the most complete herbal living of [[Aburr\u00e1 Valley]] and the remains of early settlers native of Medell\u00edn, among other attractions.\n\nOther parks in the city include North Park and Juan Pablo II Park.

Among the most representative churches are the [[Metropolitan Cathedral of Medell\u00edn|Metropolitan Cathedral]], the largest cathedral in the world built entirely in baked brick. There is also the [[Basilica of Our Lady of Candelaria]], which was the official cathedral until 1931, the [[Church of San Ignacio (Medell\u00edn)|Church of San Ignacio]], Baroque on the outside and Colonial on inside, the [[Church of San Jos\u00e9 (Medell\u00edn)|Church of San Jos\u00e9]], the [[Church of San Antonio (Medell\u00edn)|Church of San Antonio]], which has one of the biggest domes in Colombia, the [[Church of San Jos\u00e9 del Poblado]], located in the Parque del Poblado where the first European settlement in the [[Aburr\u00e1 Valley]] was founded in 1616, and the [[Church of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Bel\u00e9n (Medell\u00edn)|Church of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Bel\u00e9n]].

The [[sillero|silletero]] tradition is also closely tied to the region and is considered a part of Colombian [[cultural heritage]]. Since 1957, this tradition has continued in the Silleta Parade that takes place during the annual [[Festival of the Flowers]], where silletas designed with flower arrangements are carried.\n\nWorks of many prominent artists, both local and foreign, can be seen on the streets of the city. Some artists who stand out are the masters [[Rodrigo Arenas Betancur]] and [[Fernando Botero]].\n\n===Paisa culture===\n{{Main|Paisa region}}\nThe inhabitants of Medell\u00edn are often called ''Antioque\u00f1os'' (people of Antioquia) after their province, rather than ''Medell\u00ednenses'' (people of Medell\u00edn) after their city. They are also often known as ''[[Paisa Region|Paisas]]'', a name which some suggest comes from the coffee growers. The term ''Paisa'' comes from the word ''paisano'', meaning \"fellow countryman\". ''Paisas'' make up one of the five different regional cultures within Colombia. In addition to Antioquia, the [[Paisa region]] includes the departments of [[Caldas Department|Caldas]], [[Risaralda Department|Risaralda]], [[Quindio]] and some towns of [[Valle del Cauca]] and [[Department of Tolima|Tolima]]. Although Paisa culture is dominant in Medell\u00edn, the so-called \"Paisa Capital\", the city is becoming more cosmopolitan, now offering music from other regions of Colombia ([[Vallenato]] and [[Department of Choc\u00f3|Choc\u00f3]]), and a variety of restaurants including Chinese, Cuban, and Argentinian.\n\nThe Paisa culture has a Spanish background, and is traditionally Catholic, and entrepreneurial.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} Paisas are said to speak softly and quickly, to smile easily, and to love music, poetry, soccer, bargaining in the markets, and parties. They are proud of their city, and work hard to keep it clean, stemming from the campaign begun in the 1980s, \"Depende tambien de ti, darle amor a Medell\u00edn\" (It depends on you too to give love to Medell\u00edn). The Medell\u00edn weekend nightlife, in discos, pubs, parks, and certain dedicated streets, is traditionally called ''rumba''.<ref name=\"MattBrown\">{{cite web|last=Brown|first=Matthew|url=http://albeiror24.wordpress.com/2008/03/11/colombia-an-emerging-travel-destination/|title=Colombia: An Emerging Travel Destination|date=11 March 2008|accessdate=2008-05-04}}</ref>\n\n===Festivals and events===\n[[File:Alumbrado 2011 - AV La Playa-2.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Christmas lights in Medell\u00edn|Christmas Lighting]] on ''La Playa'' Avenue in 2011.]]\n* '''[[Festival of the Flowers]]''' is held late July to early August.

It is located in the [[Aburr\u00e1 Valley]], a central region of the [[Andes Mountains]] in South America. According to the [[National Administrative Department of Statistics (Colombia)|National Administrative Department of Statistics]], the city had an estimated population of 2,427,129 according to the 2018 census.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> With its surrounding area that includes nine other cities, the [[Metropolitan Area of Medell\u00edn|metropolitan area of Medell\u00edn]] is the second-largest urban agglomeration in Colombia in terms of population and economy, with more than 3.7 million people.\n\nIn 1616 the Spaniard Francisco Herrera Campuzano erected a small indigenous village (\"''poblado''\") known as \"[[Lawrence of Rome|Saint Lawrence]] of Aburr\u00e1\" (''San Lorenzo de Aburr\u00e1''), located in the present-day [[El Poblado (Medell\u00edn)|El Poblado]] commune. On 2 November 1675, the [[queen consort]] [[Mariana of Austria]] founded the \"Town of [[Virgin of Candelaria|Our Lady of Candelaria]] of Medell\u00edn\" (''Villa de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Candelaria de Medell\u00edn'') in the An\u00e1 region, which today corresponds to the center of the city (east-central zone) and first describes the region as \"Medell\u00edn\". In 1826, the city was named the capital of the [[Department of Antioquia]] by the National Congress of the nascent [[Republic of Gran Colombia]], comprised by present-day Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, and Panama. After Colombia won its independence from Spain, Medell\u00edn became the capital of the Federal State of Antioquia until 1888, with the proclamation of the [[Colombian Constitution of 1886]]. During the 19th century, Medell\u00edn was a dynamic commercial center, first exporting gold, then producing and exporting coffee.\n\nAt the beginning of the 21st century, the city regained industrial dynamism, with the construction of the [[Medell\u00edn Metro]] commuter rail, liberalized development policies, improved security and improved education. Researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] have lauded the city as a pioneer of a post-[[Washington consensus]] \"[[Developmental state#Local Developmental State|local development state]]\" model of economic development.<ref name=ODI1>Milford Bateman, Juan Pablo Duran Ort\u00edz and Kate Maclean 2010.

He sent Jer\u00f3nimo Luis Tejelo to explore the territory, and during the night of August 23, Tejelo reached the plain of what is now Aburr\u00e1 Valley. The Spaniards gave it the name of \"Valley of [[Bartholomew the Apostle|Saint Bartholomew]]\", but this was soon changed for the native name ''Aburr\u00e1'', meaning \"Painters\", due to the textile decorations of the local chief-men.<ref name=\"restrepo\">Restrepo Uribe, Jorge (1981), Medell\u00edn, su Origen, Progreso y Desarrollo, Servigr\u00e1ficas, Medell\u00edn. {{ISBN|84-300-3286-X}}.</ref>\n\nIn 1574, Gaspar de Rodas asked the [[Department of Antioquia|Antioquia's]] [[Cabildo (council)|Cabildo]] for {{convert|4|mi2|km2|order=flip|0|sp=us}} of land to establish herds and a ranch in the valley. The Cabildo granted him {{convert|3|mi2|km2|order=flip|0|sp=us}} of land.<ref name=\"restrepo\"/>\n\nIn 1616, the colonial visitor Francisco de Herrera y Campuzano founded a settlement with 80 Amerindians, naming it ''Poblado de San Lorenzo'', today \"[[El Poblado, Medell\u00edn|El Poblado]]\". In 1646 a colonial law ordered the separation of Amerindians from [[mestizo]]s and [[mulatto]]s, so the colonial administration began the construction of a new town in An\u00e1, today [[Berr\u00edo Park]], where the church of ''Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Candelaria de An\u00e1'' (\"Our Lady of Candelaria of An\u00e1\") was built. Three years later, the Spaniards started the construction of the [[Basilica of Our Lady of Candelaria]], which was rebuilt at the end of the 18th century.<ref name=\"restrepo\"/>\n\n===Growth of the town===\n[[File:Catedral de Medell\u00edn-Fachada P.jpg|240px|left|thumbnail|[[Metropolitan Cathedral of Medell\u00edn]].]]\n\nAfter 1574, with Gaspar de Rodas settled in the valley, the population started to grow. According to the church records of the San Lorenzo Church, six couples married between 1646 and 1650, and 41 between 1671 and 1675.<ref name=\"restrepo\"/> Gold mines were developed northeast of Antioquia, thus they needed food supply from nearby agriculture. The Aburr\u00e1 Valley was in a strategic position between the gold mines and the first provincial capital of Antioquia, [[Santa Fe de Antioquia]].<ref name=\"restrepo\"/>\n\nThe provincial capital, Santa Fe, started to lose importance and gradually became poor, as trade and prominent personalities of the region came to the Aburr\u00e1 Valley, where rich families started to buy land. Soon, the first settlers asked for the creation of a [[Cabildo (council)]] in the valley, thus getting a separate government from Santa Fe.<ref name=\"restrepo\"/> The Santa Fe government fought this, but Mariana of Austria signed the edict creating the Cabildo on November 22, 1674.

The houses of the most important people were two stories tall, and the church and the Cabildo were unimpressive. It was only during the 18th century that the church was improved. Only one story, the Cabildo was located at the western part of the plaza. It had a thatched roof until 1742 when tiles were put on. In 1682, traders and foreigners started the construction of the [[Iglesia de la Veracruz (Medell\u00edn)|Veracruz Hermitage]], which was consecrated as a church by the Bishop of [[Popay\u00e1n]] in 1712.<ref name=\"restrepo\"/>\n\nIn 1675, the first census during colonial times was taken: there were 3,000 people and 280 families. Another census was not taken until the colonial Visitador (royal inspector) [[Antonio Mon y Velarde]] ordered one between 1786 and 1787: there were then 14,507 people and 241 families. In 1808, two years before Colombia won independence, the city had 15,347 people and 360 families.<ref name=\"restrepo\"/>\n\nIn 1803, the Royal College of the Franciscans was founded in the Central Plaza, which is [[Berr\u00edo Park]] today, with the initial departments of Grammar, Philosophy, and Theology.<ref>'\"Suramericana de Seguros\", in ''History of Antioquia,'' Ed.

The University also had the first vocational training school, the first cultural radio station in Latin America, and the first regional [[botanical garden]].\n\n===Industrial revolution===\nIn the first half of the twentieth century, the population of Medell\u00edn increased sixfold, from 59,815 inhabitants in 1905 to 358,189 in 1951. The [[Thousand Days War]] (1899\u20131902) stopped the industrial development of the city, although the civil war did not affect the region directly. Under reforms by President [[Rafael Reyes]] after the conflict, the city continued its industrial development<ref name=\"restrepo\"/> and founded a [[Chamber of commerce]].  The Chamber developed a regional transport project that connected Medell\u00edn to other Colombian regions and other nations.\n\nDespite the importance of gold production in the early development of Medell\u00edn, the export of coffee contributed the most impetus in the 20th century for the city's growth. Trade grew to international dimensions as the main export of Colombia became [[Coffee production in Colombia|coffee]].

The Antioquia Railway (built in 1875) conquered the difficult geography of one of the most mountainous regions of South America, notably with the [[La Quiebra Tunnel]], which connected the industrial center to the [[Magdalena River]], the most major navigable river in Colombia.

Savage on industrial production in Antioquia between 1960 and 1972 showed how important Medell\u00edn industries became to Colombia and South America. He studied social change produced by the introduction of new technology. Savage looked at three factories in Antioquia: two potteries in [[Santuario]] and [[La Blanca (Colombia)|La Blanca]], and a tailoring factory in Medell\u00edn. Savage studied the production of the Antioquian factories, and the relationship between the workers and their employers, an industrial efficiency which he called the \"Culture of Work\".<ref>Savage presented his thesis ''Factories in the Andes: Social Organization in a Developing Economy'' for his PhD in Business Administration at [[Harvard University]] in 1962.</ref> His conclusions were published by his colleague [[George F.

[[Paul Lester Wiener]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Sert]] were the architects who led the project. Among the main features of the MMP were the canalization of the [[Medell\u00edn River]], the control of new settlements on valley slopes, the creation of an industrial zone in the Guayabal District, the planning of the city to be in harmony with the river, the construction of a city stadium, and an administrative center in [[La Alpujarra Administrative Center|La Alpujarra]].<ref name=\"restrepo\"/>\n\nIn 1951 the city had 358,189 inhabitants, but 22 years later, in 1973, the population had tripled to 1,071,252.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalurban.org/GUDMag07Vol3Iss1/Betancur.htm|title=Approaches to the Regularization of Informal Settlements: the case of primed in Medell\u00edn, Colombia|publisher=Global Urban Development Magazine (Volume 3, Issue 1)|author=John J.

The traditional Junin Theatre along the Santa Elena was demolished to build the Coltejer Tower. The huge migration into Medell\u00edn provided workers for the expansion of textile factories, being modernized in this period,<ref name=\"restrepo\"/> but it also created new problems for the city: higher unemployment, lack of services for poor areas, urban violence in several districts, and collapse of any hope of a transport system. {{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n===Today===\n[[File:Medellin sightseeing.jpg|alt=|thumb|240x240px|View of Medell\u00edn at night]]\nThe position of Medell\u00edn as the second industrial city in Colombia has been the main factor in overcoming its crisis of the 1980s and 1990s.

The neighborhoods with the biggest inequity and violence issues are identified and important investments are made in them. There is no previous agenda over what the specific nature of the interventions will finally be since the projects use a communicative approach to define what is best for the community with the active participation of its members.<ref name=\"Alcald\u00eda de Medell\u00edn 2004\"/> The outcomes will depend on what the neighborhood decides supported by the inclusion of the expertise of city organizations. The projects will have to incorporate all the elements needed to foster development and will be executed simultaneously to assure the biggest impact.\n\nAside from usual city investment in public infrastructure and as a result of this approach to city development, there were four main concrete projects that were established to help achieve the objectives of peace and social equity based on the guidelines proposed in the Medell\u00edn City Plan by the Council of Medell\u00edn.<ref name=\"Alcald\u00eda de Medell\u00edn 2004\"/>\n\n===Libraries and \"library parks\"===\n[[File:Biblioteca Leon de Greiff-Exterior4-Medellin.JPG|thumb|left|230px|[[Le\u00f3n de Greiff Library]]]]\n{{Main|Library park (Colombia)}}\nA \"library park\" ({{lang-es|Parque biblioteca}}) is a term first used in Medell\u00edn for an urban complex formed by a combination of a library building with ample surrounding green space for public use.

Although the Aburr\u00e1 Valley was a hotspot in agriculture and livestock throughout the colonial period, their relative wealth is not expressed in an outstanding and Cartagena, Tunja, Popay\u00e1n and Bogot\u00e1 civil and religious architecture. This can be explained by the fact that the population of Medell\u00edn was not political and administrative center and a place geographically isolated whose elite invested little in the development of monumental architecture. From the end of the colony remain, but with many transformations, the Candelaria Church and the Church of the Veracruz.\n\n[[File:2018 Medell\u00edn fachada de la iglesia de La Veracruz.jpg|thumb|The Church of the Veracruz remains, but with many transformations, from the end of the colonial period.]]\nThe architecture produced in Colombia between 1850 and 1930 is called \"Republican\". The use of brick and implementation of European historical styles were the main novelty. Enrique Haeusler designed the Guayaquil Bridge in 1879. But it was the French architect Carlos Carr\u00e9 who headlined Republican nineteenth century architecture in Medell\u00edn. Carr\u00e9 came to town in 1889 and was hired to design and build the new Episcopal Cathedral and several commercial and residential buildings for different parts of the city, especially in the new neighborhood of Guayaquil. The Metropolitan Cathedral was completed in 1931; also are of authorship V\u00e1squez and Carr\u00e9 buildings, which are located next to [[Plaza Cisneros]]. The Medell\u00edn Antioquia Railway Station was the work of Enrique Olarte, a work that allowed the definitive urban consolidation in Guayaquil sector. In the twenties Republican architecture reached its peak phase. In this period stand the old Municipal Palace (now the Museum of Antioquia) in 1928, the National Palace and the Palace of Departmental Government (now the Palace of Culture) between 1925 and 1928. The latter two works were designed by the Belgian architect [[Agust\u00edn Goovaerts]], both inspired by the Belgian modernist, it applied the Romanesque and Gothic styles respectively. Other works of Goovaerts were the Church of the Sacred Heart (sector Guayaquil), the Church of San Ignacio, among others. The thirties highlighted such constructions of the Prado neighborhood as the Egyptian house and the current Teatro Prado.\n\n===Parks===\nThe main parks of the city include [[Berr\u00edo Park]] in the center of the city; [[Bol\u00edvar Park (Medell\u00edn, Colombia)|Bol\u00edvar Park]], a little further north and framed by the Metropolitan Cathedral; and others in more residential areas like Bethlehem Park, El Poblado Park, and Laureles Park. Several modern parks are interactive and have had a positive reception from the people because they are not only places of recreation but also of education. These include Barefoot Park, Wishes Park, [[Explora Park]], and Bicentennial Park (which was recently opened to mark the bicentenary of Colombia).\n\nOne of the most visited sites is the [[Arv\u00ed Ecotourism Park]], which has an area of about 20,000 hectares, covers virtually the entire territory of the village of [[Santa Elena (Medell\u00edn)|Santa Elena]], and runs between the towns of [[Bello, Antioquia|Bello]], [[Copacabana, Antioquia|Copacabana]], and [[Envigado]].

Among the most representative churches are the [[Metropolitan Cathedral of Medell\u00edn|Metropolitan Cathedral]], the largest cathedral in the world built entirely in baked brick.

They are also often known as ''[[Paisa Region|Paisas]]'', a name which some suggest comes from the coffee growers. The term ''Paisa'' comes from the word ''paisano'', meaning \"fellow countryman\". ''Paisas'' make up one of the five different regional cultures within Colombia. In addition to Antioquia, the [[Paisa region]] includes the departments of [[Caldas Department|Caldas]], [[Risaralda Department|Risaralda]], [[Quindio]] and some towns of [[Valle del Cauca]] and [[Department of Tolima|Tolima]]. Although Paisa culture is dominant in Medell\u00edn, the so-called \"Paisa Capital\", the city is becoming more cosmopolitan, now offering music from other regions of Colombia ([[Vallenato]] and [[Department of Choc\u00f3|Choc\u00f3]]), and a variety of restaurants including Chinese, Cuban, and Argentinian.\n\nThe Paisa culture has a Spanish background, and is traditionally Catholic, and entrepreneurial.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} Paisas are said to speak softly and quickly, to smile easily, and to love music, poetry, soccer, bargaining in the markets, and parties. They are proud of their city, and work hard to keep it clean, stemming from the campaign begun in the 1980s, \"Depende tambien de ti, darle amor a Medell\u00edn\" (It depends on you too to give love to Medell\u00edn).

It was declared a Cultural Heritage and Historic Monument by the Council of Medell\u00edn in 2002. It was founded on February 14, 1973, by the Argentine Leonardo Nieto Jarbon in the neighborhood Manrique, in a simple, traditional house. The tango singer [[Carlos Gardel]] met his death in Medell\u00edn in accident airplane crash. There has long existed in the city a deep tango culture. Some plaques testify the visit to the house of personalities from politics, entertainment and literature, as the Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges.\n* '''[[Parque Explora]]''' is an interactive museum focused on science, technology and many other aspects of knowledge and creativity.

A typical regional dish is the [[bandeja paisa]], meaning the \"paisa platter\", which usually includes beans, rice, pork cracklings (or \"chicharr\u00f3n\"), [[chorizo]], a fried egg, [[tostones|patac\u00f3n]]es, salad and avocado. It is traditionally served on a tray slab or wood. It is traditional to consume meals with arepas, which are made with cooked, milled, and mixed corn without further ingredients.\n\nFor breakfast, it is common to accompany the food with [[hot chocolate]] and possibly a slice of cheese to dunk in the drink. [[Parva (food)|Parva]] is a traditional component of the Antioquian gastronomy as well. This name is given to a wide variety of sweet and savory baked goods, including [[pan de queso]], [[pan de bono]], [[bu\u00f1uelo]]s, and pastries.\n\nOther foods that are typical in the region stem from Colombian food industries, such as [[Postob\u00f3n]] Colombian sodas, the regional [[aguardiente#Colombia|aguardiente]] known as ''Aguardiente Antioque\u00f1o'', and Jet chocolate bars.\n\n==Sports and recreation==\nSoccer is the most popular sport and is widely played in the city. Medell\u00edn has two professional clubs: [[Atl\u00e9tico Nacional]], founded in 1935, and [[Independiente Medell\u00edn]], founded in 1913. Both teams play at the Atanasio Girardot Stadium. The city has a soccer legacy thanks to notable players such as [[Rene Higuita]], [[Iv\u00e1n C\u00f3rdoba]], [[Andr\u00e9s Escobar]], and [[V\u00edctor Aristiz\u00e1bal]], among many others. Other notable sportsmen of the city are the professional golfer and PGA Tour player [[Camilo Villegas]], Medillin-born Israeli Olympic [[show jumping]] rider [[Daniel Bluman]], and the retired [[Formula One]], [[Champ Car]], and [[IndyCar]] driver [[Roberto Guerrero]].\n\n[[File:Atanacio girardot antes de la apertura de los juegos.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Atanasio Girardot Sports Complex]]]]\nA popular sport in Medell\u00edn, and generally throughout Antioquia, is [[equitation|horseback riding]]; therefore, it has encouraged trade and production of tools and equipments for this activity, such as chairs and horseshoes for export. During the Festival of the Flowers, the [[cavalcade]]s achieved a [[Guinness World Record]] in 1996 and 1999.\n\nThe city also has two Colombian professional basketball teams: the [[Arriero]]s of Antioquia and the Mountain Academy.\n\n===Hosting===\nThe [[Atanasio Girardot Sports Complex]] is the main sports arena complex of the city.

In 2013, Medell\u00edn hosted the IAAF [[Pan American Junior Athletics Championships]] for track and field. Again, athletes and teams from the countries in North, South, and Central America as well as the Caribbean Islands participated. The junior athletes competed as a test trial for the [[2018 Summer Youth Olympics]].\n\n[[Medell\u00edn bid for the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics|Medell\u00edn bid]] to host the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics but was defeated by [[Buenos Aires]] in the July 4, 2013 vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/news/buenos-aires-elected-as-host-city-for-2018-youth-olympic-games/202222|title=Buenos Aires elected as Host City for 2018 Youth Olympic Games|date=21 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Cycling and BMX===\nAnother representative sport in the city is [[cycling]].

It is probably Berg's best-known and most frequently performed instrumental piece, in which the composer sought to reconcile [[diatonicism]] and [[dodecaphony]]. Berg composed it on a commission from [[Louis Krasner]], and it became the last work that he completed. Krasner performed the solo part in the premiere at the [[Palau de la M\u00fasica Catalana]], [[Barcelona]] on 19 April 1936, after the composer's death.\n\n== Conception and composition ==\nThe piece stemmed from a commission from the [[violin]]ist [[Louis Krasner]]. When he first received the commission, Berg was working on his opera ''[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]'', and he did not begin work on the [[concerto]] for some months. The event that spurred him into writing was the death by polio of 18-year-old [[Manon Gropius]], the daughter of [[Alma Mahler]] (once [[Gustav Mahler]]'s wife) and [[Walter Gropius]]. Berg set ''Lulu'' aside to write the concerto, which he dedicated \"To the memory of an angel\".<ref name=\"Glass\" />\n\nBerg worked on the piece very quickly, completing it within a few months; it is thought that his working on the concerto was largely responsible for his failing to complete ''Lulu'' before his death on 24 December 1935. The violin concerto was the last work that Berg completed. In a letter to Krasner dated 16 July 1935, Berg confessed: {{quote|Yesterday I finished the composition [without the orchestration] of our Violin Concerto. I am probably more surprised by it than you will be (...) the work gave me more and more joy. I hope - no, I have the confident belief - that I have succeeded.}}\n\n== Scoring ==\n[[File:Louis Krasner (1903\u20131995) und Helene Berg (1885\u20131976) mit der Partitur des Violinkonzerts (1961) OeNB 657332.png|thumb|Krasner and Berg's widow Helene with the score (1961)]]\nThe concerto is scored for 2 [[Western concert flute|flutes]] (both doubling as [[piccolo]]), 2 [[oboe]]s (one doubling as a [[cor anglais]]), [[alto saxophone]] (doubling as 3rd clarinet), 2 [[clarinet]]s, [[bass clarinet]], 2 [[bassoon]]s, [[contrabassoon]], 4 [[French horn|horns]], 2 [[trumpet]]s, 2 [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], [[percussion]], [[harp]] and [[string section|strings]].<ref name=\"Glass\">{{cite news\n |last         = Glass\n |first        = Herbert\n |url          = https://www.laphil.com/philpedia/music/violin-concerto-alban-berg\n |title        = Violin Concerto \u2013 About the piece\n |publisher    = [[LA Phil]]\n |accessdate   = 2 November 2017\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20171107012243/https://www.laphil.com/philpedia/music/violin-concerto-alban-berg\n |archive-date = 7 November 2017\n |url-status     = dead\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\n== Music ==\nBerg described the structure of the concerto in a letter to [[Arnold Schoenberg]].<ref>Brand et al.

The second movement starts with an [[tempo|Allegro]] largely based on a single recurring [[rhythm]]ic [[cell (music)|cell]]; this section has been described as [[cadenza]]-like, with very difficult passages in the solo part. The orchestration becomes rather violent at its climax (which is literally marked in the score as \"High point of the Allegro\"); the fourth and final section, marked [[tempo|Adagio]], is in a much calmer mood. The first two sections are meant to represent life, the last two death and [[Transfiguration (religion)|transfiguration]].\n\n[[Image:Berg - Violin Concerto lament melody.png|thumb|right|400px|\"lament\" melody and its construction from the pitches of RI-5 and P-8<ref>Whittall, Arnold. 2008.

The score integrates serialism and tonality in a remarkable fashion. Here is Berg's tone row:\n:<score vorbis=\"1\"> \\new Staff \\with { \\remove \"Time_signature_engraver\" \\remove \"Bar_engraver\" } \\relative c' { \\clef treble \\override Stem #'transparent = ##t g4 bes d fis a c e gis b cis ees f } </score>\nAlthough this contains all twelve notes of the [[chromatic scale]], there is a strong tonal undercurrent: the first three notes of the row make up a [[G minor]] [[Triad (music)|triad]]; notes three to five are a [[D major]] triad; notes five to seven are an [[A minor]] triad; notes seven to nine are an [[E major]] triad;\n:<score vorbis=\"1\"> { \\new PianoStaff << \\new Staff \\relative c' { \\clef treble \\time 2/4 r8 <d bes>4( <d bes>8~ | <d bes> <d a>4 <d a>8~ | <d a>) <c a>4( <c a>8~ | <c a> <b e,>4 <b e,>8) } \\new Staff \\relative c { \\clef bass \\time 2/4 g,2( | fis' | e' | gis, } >> } </score>\nand the last four notes (B, C{{music|#}}, E{{music|b}}, F) and the first (G) together make up part of a [[whole tone scale]].  The roots of the four triads correspond to the [[Open string (music)|open strings]] of the violin, which is highlighted in the opening passage of the piece.\n:<score vorbis=\"1\"> \\relative c' { \\clef treble \\numericTimeSignature \\time 4/4 g8(\\pp d' a' e') e( a, d, g,~ | g1) } </score>\nThe resulting triads are thus fifth-related and form a [[cadence (music)|cadence]], which we hear directly before the row is played by the violin for the first time.  Moreover, the four chords above imply the note sequence  B (B{{music|flat}}) \u2013 A \u2013 C \u2013 H (B{{music|natural}}) which forms the [[BACH motif]], thus connecting the piece to [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], whose music plays a crucial role in this concerto. \n\nThe last four notes of the row, ascending whole tones, are also the first four notes of the [[chorale]] melody of \"[[Es ist genug]]\" (It is enough), another part of the whole tone scale. Bach composed a [[SATB|four-part]] setting of the hymn by [[Franz Joachim Burmeister]] with a melody by [[Johann Rudolf Ahle]] to conclude his cantata [[O Ewigkeit, du Donnerwort, BWV 60|''O Ewigkeit, du Donnerwort'', BWV 60]] (O eternity, you word of thunder).<ref>[http://www.bach-chorales.com/BWV0060_5.htm BWV 60.5] bach-chorales.com</ref> The first four measures are shown below.\n\n: <score lang=\"lilypond\" vorbis=\"1\">\n   \\new PianoStaff <<\n      \\new Staff <<\n         \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n             \\stemUp \\clef treble \\key f \\major \\time 4/4\n             \\[ f2 g4 a \n             b2 \\] r4 b\n             c4 g g bes! \n             a2.\n             }\n         \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n             \\stemDown\n              c2 c4 bes8 a \n              e'2 s4 e\n              e4. f8 e d e c \n              f2.\n              }\n            >>\n     \\new Staff <<\n         \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n             \\stemUp \\clef bass \\key f \\major \\time 4/4\n             a2 g4 d' \n             d2 r4 gis,\n             a8 b c4 c c \n             c2.\n             }\n         \\new Voice \\relative c {\n             \\stemDown\n             f2 e4 fis \n             gis2 s4 e\n             a8 g!16 f e8 d c bes! a g!\n             f2.\n             }\n         >>\n    >>\n</score>\n\nBerg quotes this chorale directly in the last movement of the piece, where Bach's harmonization is heard in the [[clarinet]]s. \n\nThere is another directly quoted tonal passage in the work in the form of a [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthian]] [[folk song]] in the second section of the first movement, which returns briefly before the [[Coda (music)|coda]] in the second movement.

Its length varied from two to four feet, and was either wielded with one hand or with both. It was used as a combat weapon, as an execution tool, and as a display of power. Occasional use as an agricultural and butchering tool has also been noted. The sword's name is a shortening of the word \"pang-tabas\", which means \"chopping tool\". As such, its etymological origins are the root word ''tabas'' (\"to chop off\").\n[[File:Parts of a balisong3.jpg|120px|thumb|[[Butterfly knife|Balisong]]]]\n* The ''[[Balisong (knife)|Balisong]]'' (a type of butterfly knife or fan knife) is a folding [[pocket knife]] with two handles counter-rotating around the [[Tang (tools)|tang]] such that, when closed, the blade is concealed within grooves in the handles. It is sometimes called a [[Batangas]] knife, after the Tagalog province of Batangas, where it is traditionally made. In the hands of a trained user, the knife blade can be brought to bear quickly using one hand. Manipulations, called \"flipping\" or \"fanning\", are performed for art or amusement.\n* The ''[[Barong (knife)|barong]]'' or ''barung'', is a short sword with a leaf-shaped blade, widely used in the island of Mindanao.\n* The ''[[gunong]]'' or ''puny\u00e1l'' (also known as ''pu\u00f1al de kris'' or ''kris knife'') is a knife from Mindanao. It is essentially a diminutive form of the larger kalis or kris. The gunong serves both as a utility knife and as a thrusting weapon used for close quarter fighting \u2013 usually as a last defense. It is most often associated with the ethnic Maranao, among whom the gunong was traditionally carried by both sexes. The weapon is generally tucked into the back of a waist sash.\n\n[[File:Kampilan and two Krises.JPG|thumb|200px|right|A ''kampilan'' hilt is sometimes wrapped with rattan to improve the grip. The two holes on the crossguard are where the metal \"staples\" (C- or U-shaped) go, as additional protection for the wielder's hand.]]\n* The ''[[kampilan]]'' is a type of single-edged long [[sword]], used on the islands of [[Mindanao]], Visayas, and [[Luzon]]. The kampilan has a distinct profile, with the tapered blade being much broader and thinner at the point than at its base, sometimes with a protruding spikelet along the flat side of the tip and a bifurcated hilt which is believed to represent a mythical creature's open mouth. A notable wielder of the kampilan was [[Lapu-Lapu]] (the king of Mactan) and his warriors, who defeated the Spaniards and killed Portuguese explorer [[Ferdinand Magellan]] at the [[Battle of Mactan]] in 1521. The mention of the kampilan in ancient [[Filipino epics]] originating from other non-Muslim areas such as the Hiligaynon Hinilawod and the Ilocano [[Biag ni Lam-Ang]] is possible evidence for the sword's widespread usage throughout the archipelago during pre-Hispanic times\n* The [[kalis]] is a type of double-edged [[Philippines|Filipino]] [[sword]], often with a \"wavy\" section, similar to a [[keris]]. Just like the [[keris]], the Kalis's double-edged blade can be used for both cutting and thrusting; except that the Kalis is much larger than most Kerises, making it a sword rather than a dagger. The wavy portion of the kalis is said to be meant to facilitate easier slashing in battle - since a straight edge tends to get stuck in the opponent's bones, the wavy portion allows the kalis' bearer to more easily pull the weapon out of his opponent's body.<ref name=\"historychannelasia\">{{cite video|people=|date=|title=Raiders of the Sulu Sea|url=http://www.historychannelasia.comsynopsis.aspx?libId=347&sId=70&sTime=1200|format=|medium=Documentary|publisher=Oakfilms3, History Channel Asia|location=|accessdate=2009-02-08|time=|quote=}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===Firearms/projectile weapons===\n[[File:Rentaka Melayu.jpg|thumb|Two ''lantakas'']]\n* The [[lantaka]] (also known as ''kanyon'' in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]) were a type of [[bronze]] [[swivel gun]] mounted on [[merchant vessel]]s travelling the waterways of Malay Archipelago.

Its length varied from two to four feet, and was either wielded with one hand or with both. It was used as a combat weapon, as an execution tool, and as a display of power. Occasional use as an agricultural and butchering tool has also been noted. The sword's name is a shortening of the word \"pang-tabas\", which means \"chopping tool\". As such, its etymological origins are the root word ''tabas'' (\"to chop off\").\n[[File:Parts of a balisong3.jpg|120px|thumb|[[Butterfly knife|Balisong]]]]\n* The ''[[Balisong (knife)|Balisong]]'' (a type of butterfly knife or fan knife) is a folding [[pocket knife]] with two handles counter-rotating around the [[Tang (tools)|tang]] such that, when closed, the blade is concealed within grooves in the handles. It is sometimes called a [[Batangas]] knife, after the Tagalog province of Batangas, where it is traditionally made. In the hands of a trained user, the knife blade can be brought to bear quickly using one hand. Manipulations, called \"flipping\" or \"fanning\", are performed for art or amusement.\n* The ''[[Barong (knife)|barong]]'' or ''barung'', is a short sword with a leaf-shaped blade, widely used in the island of Mindanao.\n* The ''[[gunong]]'' or ''puny\u00e1l'' (also known as ''pu\u00f1al de kris'' or ''kris knife'') is a knife from Mindanao. It is essentially a diminutive form of the larger kalis or kris. The gunong serves both as a utility knife and as a thrusting weapon used for close quarter fighting \u2013 usually as a last defense. It is most often associated with the ethnic Maranao, among whom the gunong was traditionally carried by both sexes. The weapon is generally tucked into the back of a waist sash.\n\n[[File:Kampilan and two Krises.JPG|thumb|200px|right|A ''kampilan'' hilt is sometimes wrapped with rattan to improve the grip. The two holes on the crossguard are where the metal \"staples\" (C- or U-shaped) go, as additional protection for the wielder's hand.]]\n* The ''[[kampilan]]'' is a type of single-edged long [[sword]], used on the islands of [[Mindanao]], Visayas, and [[Luzon]]. The kampilan has a distinct profile, with the tapered blade being much broader and thinner at the point than at its base, sometimes with a protruding spikelet along the flat side of the tip and a bifurcated hilt which is believed to represent a mythical creature's open mouth. A notable wielder of the kampilan was [[Lapu-Lapu]] (the king of Mactan) and his warriors, who defeated the Spaniards and killed Portuguese explorer [[Ferdinand Magellan]] at the [[Battle of Mactan]] in 1521. The mention of the kampilan in ancient [[Filipino epics]] originating from other non-Muslim areas such as the Hiligaynon Hinilawod and the Ilocano [[Biag ni Lam-Ang]] is possible evidence for the sword's widespread usage throughout the archipelago during pre-Hispanic times\n* The [[kalis]] is a type of double-edged [[Philippines|Filipino]] [[sword]], often with a \"wavy\" section, similar to a [[keris]]. Just like the [[keris]], the Kalis's double-edged blade can be used for both cutting and thrusting; except that the Kalis is much larger than most Kerises, making it a sword rather than a dagger. The wavy portion of the kalis is said to be meant to facilitate easier slashing in battle - since a straight edge tends to get stuck in the opponent's bones, the wavy portion allows the kalis' bearer to more easily pull the weapon out of his opponent's body.<ref name=\"historychannelasia\">{{cite video|people=|date=|title=Raiders of the Sulu Sea|url=http://www.historychannelasia.comsynopsis.aspx?libId=347&sId=70&sTime=1200|format=|medium=Documentary|publisher=Oakfilms3, History Channel Asia|location=|accessdate=2009-02-08|time=|quote=}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===Firearms/projectile weapons===\n[[File:Rentaka Melayu.jpg|thumb|Two ''lantakas'']]\n* The [[lantaka]] (also known as ''kanyon'' in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]) were a type of [[bronze]] [[swivel gun]] mounted on [[merchant vessel]]s travelling the waterways of Malay Archipelago.

The guns were used to defend against [[pirate|pirates]] demanding tribute for the local chief, or potentate. Although most lantaka weighed under two hundred pounds, and many only a few pounds, the largest ones exceeded a thousand pounds, and some weighed over a ton. Many of these guns were mounted on [[swivel]]s and were known as [[swivel gun]]s. The smaller ones could be mounted almost anywhere including in the [[rigging]].
