The same-sex marriage law became effective from 19 August 2013, and since then married same-sex couples have been able to adopt children jointly. Unmarried couples of any sex and couples in a civil union can jointly adopt children following a [[New Zealand High Court]] ruling in December 2015. The court ruled that the ban breached the ''[[New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990]]''.<ref>[http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/292701/victory-for-same-sex-couples-wanting-to-adopt Victory for same-sex couples wanting to adopt] ''Radio New Zealand''</ref> The minimum age to adopt in New Zealand is 20 years for a related child and 25 years or the child's age plus 20 years (whichever is greater) for an unrelated child.\n\nOn 21 May 2006, Green List MP [[Metiria Turei]] raised the issue of [[LGBT adoption]], arguing that New Zealand's ''Adoption Act 1955'' did not meet the complexities of contemporary New Zealand society. She argued following the enactment of civil unions in particular that eligible lesbian and gay prospective parents should be enabled to legally adopt.\n\nMany lesbian couples are now raising children in New Zealand. Where these children are conceived through donor (sperm) insemination, both of the lesbians are recognised on the children's birth certificates (the birth mother as \"mother\", the other mother as \"other parent\"). This is following the ''Care of Children Act 2004'', which replaced the ''Status of Children Act 1969''. Fostering and guardianship are also recognised under New Zealand law and regulation, and reproductive technology has been accessible since 1994.\n\nThe donor is not recognised as a legal parent in New Zealand law. However, parents and donors can make formal agreements as to how things will work but the courts do have flexibility as to whether they recognise these agreements or not, under section 41 of the ''Care of Children Act 2004''.\n\nLesbians who have trouble conceiving using private donor insemination may be eligible, as other New Zealand women are, to help through publicly funded fertility treatment. However, there are conditions on this and every woman needing fertility treatment is scored as to her eligibility.\n\nNow passed, the current ''[[Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Act 2013]]'' enables eligible married same-sex parents to adopt children as there is a clause to that effect contained therein. However, known-relative adoptions in New Zealand have outnumbered stranger adoptions since the mid-1970s; between 2007 and 2013, there were 18 known-relative and stepchild adoptions for every 10 stranger adoptions.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.cyf.govt.nz/about-us/who-we-are-what-we-do/adoptions-data-back-up.html |title= Adoptions Data |publisher= Department of Child, Youth and Family |accessdate= 1 March 2014}}</ref> Also, under New Zealand law, birth parents can choose the adoptive parents for their child(ren), possibly resulting in discrimination for same-sex couples seeking to adopt.\n\n==Discrimination protections==\nThe ''[[Human Rights Act 1993]]'' ({{lang-mi|Te Ture Tika Tangata 1993}}) outlaws discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and, implicitly, gender identity/expression.<ref name=\"HRA\" /> Initially, this law temporarily exempted government activities until 1999.<ref>{{cite web|title=Observation (CEACR) - adopted 1999, published 88th ILC session (2000): Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention, 1958 (No. 111) - New Zealand (Ratification: 1983)|url=http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:13100:0::NO::P13100_COMMENT_ID:2179296|publisher=International Labour Organisation|accessdate=30 January 2017|language=en}}</ref> In 1998, an amendment bill was introduced making this exemption permanent; this was abandoned following a change of government in 1999.

In January 2006, news headlines were made by a sperm bank's policy of refusing donations from gay men. In March 2006, the policy was amended.

The bill was introduced to Parliament in August 2009 by Justice Minister [[Simon Power]], although its introduction was largely stemmed from the trial for the [[murder of Sophie Elliott]] by her ex-boyfriend, rather than the LGBT community.

In 2014, however, the country's only specialist [[surgeon]] retired, leaving transgender people seeking such operations in a state of limbo. Several chose to join the waiting list for publicly funded surgeries, which are limited to only four every two years (three for male to female, and one for female to male), or to go abroad. In October 2018, the Government announced its intention to increase the number of publicly funded operations. At that time, there were 111 people on the waiting list, meaning some had to wait up to 50 years.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/oct/19/new-zealand-reduces-30-year-wait-for-gender-reassignment-surgery New Zealand reduces 30-year wait for gender reassignment surgery].

The [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand]], the [[Human Rights Commission (New Zealand)|Human Rights Commission]], the [[New Zealand Association of Counsellors]] and every medical organisation in New Zealand support banning the [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] practice.<ref>[https://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/363321/conversion-therapy-ban-could-be-considered-justice-minister Conversion therapy ban could be considered - Justice Minister], ''Radio New Zealand'', 4 August 2018</ref> A petition to ban it was launched in mid-July, and had collected about 10,000 signatures within a week.<ref>[https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/petition-ban-gay-conversion-therapy-once-and-all-draws-thousands-signatures Petition to ban gay conversion therapy 'once and for all' draws thousands of signatures]</ref> In mid-August 2018, two petitions to ban conversion therapy were presented to Parliament, with a combined total of about 20,000 signatures.<ref>[https://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&objectid=12107458 Kyle MacDonald: Why gay conversion therapy should be banned], ''NZ Herald'', 16 August 2018</ref> A bill to prohibit conversion therapy was introduced to Parliament in October 2018.

The restriction is on the basis that [[men who have sex with men]] in New Zealand are 44 times more likely to be infected with [[HIV/AIDS]] than the general population, and the HIV testing used is not [[specificity (statistics)|specific]] enough (up to 1 in 1000 failure rate) to guarantee a 100 percent HIV-free blood supply.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nzblood.co.nz/assets/News/Final-report-to-NZBS-behavioural-donor-deferral-criteria-review.pdf |title= Report to the New Zealand Blood Service - Behavioural Donor Deferral Criteria Review |date= February 2014 |accessdate= 21 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Politics==\nGay rights were a major political issue during the Homosexual Law Reform debates, but have subsequently become much less so. The ''Civil Union Act 2004'' was opposed by nearly half of Parliament, but in tones much more restrained than that of the Homosexual Law Reform era. There has never been a specifically LGBT political party in New Zealand. There has been a succession of unsuccessful fundamentalist [[Christian politics in New Zealand|Christian political parties in New Zealand]] or socially conservative political parties less sympathetic to LGBT rights in New Zealand since the introduction of [[electoral reform in New Zealand]] in 1993 made proportional representation possible. The [[Destiny New Zealand|Destiny]] political party, founded to bring \"Christian morality\" into politics, received only 0.62% of the party vote in the [[New Zealand general election, 2005|2005 general election]]. [[Christian Heritage New Zealand]] polled 4.4% as part of the [[Christian Coalition (New Zealand)|Christian Coalition]] in 1996 but closed down in 2005 after its former leader [[Graham Capill]] was sentenced to nine years imprisonment after multiple cases of sexual assault against three female children.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO0610/S00018.htm |newspaper=Scoop |title=Christian Heritage NZ Closing Down}}</ref> [[Future New Zealand]], the [[Kiwi Party]], the aforementioned [[Destiny New Zealand]] and the [[The Family Party|Family Party]] all succeeded it, but none lasted long.

She argued following the enactment of civil unions in particular that eligible lesbian and gay prospective parents should be enabled to legally adopt.\n\nMany lesbian couples are now raising children in New Zealand. Where these children are conceived through donor (sperm) insemination, both of the lesbians are recognised on the children's birth certificates (the birth mother as \"mother\", the other mother as \"other parent\"). This is following the ''Care of Children Act 2004'', which replaced the ''Status of Children Act 1969''. Fostering and guardianship are also recognised under New Zealand law and regulation, and reproductive technology has been accessible since 1994.\n\nThe donor is not recognised as a legal parent in New Zealand law. However, parents and donors can make formal agreements as to how things will work but the courts do have flexibility as to whether they recognise these agreements or not, under section 41 of the ''Care of Children Act 2004''.\n\nLesbians who have trouble conceiving using private donor insemination may be eligible, as other New Zealand women are, to help through publicly funded fertility treatment. However, there are conditions on this and every woman needing fertility treatment is scored as to her eligibility.\n\nNow passed, the current ''[[Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Act 2013]]'' enables eligible married same-sex parents to adopt children as there is a clause to that effect contained therein. However, known-relative adoptions in New Zealand have outnumbered stranger adoptions since the mid-1970s; between 2007 and 2013, there were 18 known-relative and stepchild adoptions for every 10 stranger adoptions.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.cyf.govt.nz/about-us/who-we-are-what-we-do/adoptions-data-back-up.html |title= Adoptions Data |publisher= Department of Child, Youth and Family |accessdate= 1 March 2014}}</ref> Also, under New Zealand law, birth parents can choose the adoptive parents for their child(ren), possibly resulting in discrimination for same-sex couples seeking to adopt.\n\n==Discrimination protections==\nThe ''[[Human Rights Act 1993]]'' ({{lang-mi|Te Ture Tika Tangata 1993}}) outlaws discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and, implicitly, gender identity/expression.<ref name=\"HRA\" /> Initially, this law temporarily exempted government activities until 1999.<ref>{{cite web|title=Observation (CEACR) - adopted 1999, published 88th ILC session (2000): Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention, 1958 (No. 111) - New Zealand (Ratification: 1983)|url=http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:13100:0::NO::P13100_COMMENT_ID:2179296|publisher=International Labour Organisation|accessdate=30 January 2017|language=en}}</ref> In 1998, an amendment bill was introduced making this exemption permanent; this was abandoned following a change of government in 1999.

The ''Civil Union Act 2004'' was opposed by nearly half of Parliament, but in tones much more restrained than that of the Homosexual Law Reform era. There has never been a specifically LGBT political party in New Zealand. There has been a succession of unsuccessful fundamentalist [[Christian politics in New Zealand|Christian political parties in New Zealand]] or socially conservative political parties less sympathetic to LGBT rights in New Zealand since the introduction of [[electoral reform in New Zealand]] in 1993 made proportional representation possible. The [[Destiny New Zealand|Destiny]] political party, founded to bring \"Christian morality\" into politics, received only 0.62% of the party vote in the [[New Zealand general election, 2005|2005 general election]]. [[Christian Heritage New Zealand]] polled 4.4% as part of the [[Christian Coalition (New Zealand)|Christian Coalition]] in 1996 but closed down in 2005 after its former leader [[Graham Capill]] was sentenced to nine years imprisonment after multiple cases of sexual assault against three female children.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO0610/S00018.htm |newspaper=Scoop |title=Christian Heritage NZ Closing Down}}</ref> [[Future New Zealand]], the [[Kiwi Party]], the aforementioned [[Destiny New Zealand]] and the [[The Family Party|Family Party]] all succeeded it, but none lasted long.

Like a conventional [[piano]], the Rhodes generates sound with keys and hammers, but instead of strings, the hammers strike thin metal [[tuning fork|tines]], which vibrate between an electromagnetic [[Pickup (music technology)|pickup]]. The signal is then sent through a cable to an external [[keyboard amplifier and speaker]].\n\nThe instrument evolved from Rhodes' attempt to manufacture pianos while teaching recovering soldiers during [[World War II]]. Development continued after the war and into the following decade. In 1959, [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] began marketing the Piano Bass, a cut-down version; the full-size instrument did not appear until after Fender's sale to [[CBS]] in 1965. CBS oversaw mass production of the Rhodes piano in the 1970s, and it was used extensively through the decade, particularly in [[jazz]], [[pop music|pop]], and [[soul music]]. It was less used in the 1980s because of competition with [[Polyphony and monophony in instruments|polyphonic]] and digital [[Synthesizer|synthesizers]] such as the [[Yamaha DX7]] and an inconsistent quality control caused by [[cost reduction|cost-cutting]].\n\nIn 1987, the company was sold to [[Roland Corporation|Roland]], which manufactured digital versions of the Rhodes without authorization from Harold Rhodes. In the 1990s, the instrument experienced a resurgence in popularity, resulting in Rhodes re-obtaining the rights to the piano in 1997. Although Harold Rhodes died in 2000, the Rhodes piano has since been reissued, and his teaching methods are still in use.\n\n==Features==\n{{multiple image |align=left |direction=vertical |width=220\n | image1   = Fender Rhodes (Inside).jpg\n | caption1 = The Rhodes piano generates its sound by hammers hitting a length of wire known as a tine.\n | image2   = Tone Generator.jpg\n | caption2 = Side view of \"tone generator assembly\", resembling a [[tuning fork]] consisting of a twisted metal tone bar and the tine below it.\n}}\n{{Listen\n|filename=Rhodes Mark I Tubeamp.ogg\n|title=Rhodes Mark I Tube amp\n|description=A ''Rhodes Mark I'' played on a [[Valve amplifier|tube amplifier]] (overdriven).\n|format=[[Ogg]]}}\nThe Rhodes piano's keyboard is laid out like a traditional acoustic piano, but some models contain 73 keys instead of 88.{{sfn|Vail|2000|p=266}} The keyboard's touch and action is designed to be like an acoustic piano. Pressing a key results in a hammer striking a thin metal rod called a tine connected to a larger \"tone bar\". The tone generator assembly acts as a [[tuning fork]] as the tone bar reinforces and extending the tine's vibrations. A [[Pickup (music technology)|pickup]] sits opposite the tine, inducing an [[electric current]] from the vibrations like an electric guitar.{{sfn|Baerman|2003|p=52}} Simply hitting tines does not need an external [[power supply]], and a Rhodes will make sound even when not plugged into an [[amplifier]],{{sfn|Brice|2001|p=104}} though like an unplugged electric guitar the sound will be weak.<ref name=\"logic\">{{cite web|url=http://documentation.apple.com/en/logicstudio/instruments/index.html#chapter=9%26section=9%26tasks=true|title=Electric Piano Models Emulated by the EVP88|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]|accessdate=January 30, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe Suitcase model Rhodes includes a built-in power amplifier and a [[tremolo]] feature that bounces the output signal from the piano across two speakers.{{sfn|Gibson|1997|p=114}} This feature is inaccurately labeled \"[[vibrato]]\" (which is a variation in pitch) on some models to be consistent with the labelling on [[Fender Amplifiers|Fender amplifiers]].{{sfn|Vail|2000|p=266}}\n\nAlthough the Rhodes functions mechanically like a piano, its sound is very different.{{sfn|Gibson|1997|p=114}} Vibrating tines produce a mellower timbre,{{sfn|Gibson|1997|p=55}} and the sound changes with the tine's relative position to the pickup. Putting the two close together gives a characteristic \"bell\" sound.<ref name=\"logic\"/> The instrument has been compared with the [[Wurlitzer electric piano]], which uses a similar technology, but with the hammers striking metal reeds. The Rhodes has a better sustain, while the Wurlitzer produces significant [[harmonic]]s when the keys are played hard, giving it a \"bite\".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/dec12/articles/arturia-wurlitzer-v.htm|title=Arturia Wurlitzer V|first=Gordon|last=Reid|magazine=[[Sound on Sound]]|date=December 2012|accessdate=January 30, 2014}}</ref>\n{{clear left}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Early models===\n[[File:Prepiano.png|thumb|An early version of the Rhodes piano, used for teaching]]\n[[Harold Rhodes (inventor)|Harold Rhodes]] started teaching piano when he was 19.

Fender disliked the higher tones of the Pre-Piano, and decided to manufacture a [[keyboard bass]] using the bottom 32 notes, known as the \"Piano Bass\". The instrument introduced the design that would become common to subsequent Rhodes pianos, with the same [[tolex]] body as Fender amplifiers and a [[fiberglass]] top. The tops came from a boat manufacturer who supplied whatever color happened to be available; consequently a number of different colored piano basses were produced.{{sfn|Vail|2000|p=266}}\n\n===Under CBS===\n[[File:6f 1.png|thumb|A 1960s 73-note Fender Rhodes Electric Piano]]\nFender was bought by [[CBS]] in 1965.<ref name=\"DayBurns36\">{{cite book\n| last = Day | first = Paul\n| title = The Burns Book\n| publisher = pp Publishing\n| year = 1979 | page = 36 \n}}</ref> Rhodes stayed with the company, and released the first Fender Rhodes piano, a 73-note model. The instrument comprised parts&nbsp;\u2014 the piano, and a separate enclosure underneath containing the power amplifier and loudspeaker. Like the piano bass, it was finished in black tolex, and had a fiberglass top.{{sfn|Vail|2000|p=266}} During the late 1960s, two models of the Fender Rhodes Celeste also became available, which used the top three or four octaves, respectively, of the Fender Rhodes piano. The Celeste did not sell well and is now hard to find.{{sfn|Vail|2000|p=266}}\n\nThe Student and Instructor models were also introduced in the late 1960s. They were designed to teach the piano in the classroom. By connecting the output of a network of student models, the teacher could listen to each student in isolation on the instructor model, and send an audio [[backing track]] to them. This allowed the teacher to monitor individual students' progress.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.magnetmagazine.com/2010/10/03/pete-yorn-is-thinking-of-fender-rhodes/|title=Fender Rhodes|first=Pete|last=Yorn|work=Magnet|date=October 3, 2010|accessdate=January 30, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 1970, the 73-note Stage Piano was introduced as a lighter and more portable alternative to the existing two-piece style,<ref name=\"obit\"/> featuring four detachable legs (used in Fender steel pedal guitars), a sustain pedal and a single output jack.{{sfn|Vail|2000|p=266-67}} Although the Stage could be used with any amplifier, catalogs suggested the use of the [[Fender Twin Reverb]].<ref name=\"em\">{{cite journal|year=2002|title=Rhodes Piano|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a3IJAQAAMAAJ|publisher=Polyphony Publishing Company|volume=18|issue=1\u20134|work=Electronic Musician}}</ref> The older style piano continued to be sold alongside the Stage and was renamed the Suitcase Piano,{{sfn|Vail|2000|p=266-67}} with 88-note models also available.{{sfn|Shepherd|2003|p=301}}\n\n===Later models===\n[[File:Rhodes Mark V.jpg|thumb|The Rhodes Mk V was the last model released by the original Rhodes corporation.|alt=]]\nDuring the 1970s various changes were made to the Rhodes' mechanics.{{sfn|Vail|2000|p=267}} In 1971 the hammer tips were changed to neoprene rubber instead of felt, to avoid the excessive need for regular maintenance, while in 1975 harp supports were changed from wood to aluminum.

In 1977 the power amplifier design was changed from an 80 to a 100-watt model.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chicagoelectricpiano.com/rhodes/fender-rhodes-mark-i-vs-rhodes-mark-ii/|title=What is the difference between a Fender Rhodes Mark I and Rhodes Mark II?|publisher=Chicago Electric Piano Company|accessdate=January 30, 2014}}</ref> The Mk II model was introduced in late 1979, which was simply a set of cosmetic changes over the most recent Mk I models.

The instrument was unreliable with a problematic production, particularly when a shipment of 150 units to Japan caused interference with local television reception.

known as the '''Fender Rhodes piano''' or simply '''Fender Rhodes''' or '''Rhodes''') is an [[electric piano]] invented by [[Harold Rhodes (inventor)|Harold Rhodes]], which became popular in the 1970s. Like a conventional [[piano]], the Rhodes generates sound with keys and hammers, but instead of strings, the hammers strike thin metal [[tuning fork|tines]], which vibrate between an electromagnetic [[Pickup (music technology)|pickup]]. The signal is then sent through a cable to an external [[keyboard amplifier and speaker]].\n\nThe instrument evolved from Rhodes' attempt to manufacture pianos while teaching recovering soldiers during [[World War II]]. Development continued after the war and into the following decade. In 1959, [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] began marketing the Piano Bass, a cut-down version; the full-size instrument did not appear until after Fender's sale to [[CBS]] in 1965. CBS oversaw mass production of the Rhodes piano in the 1970s, and it was used extensively through the decade, particularly in [[jazz]], [[pop music|pop]], and [[soul music]]. It was less used in the 1980s because of competition with [[Polyphony and monophony in instruments|polyphonic]] and digital [[Synthesizer|synthesizers]] such as the [[Yamaha DX7]] and an inconsistent quality control caused by [[cost reduction|cost-cutting]].\n\nIn 1987, the company was sold to [[Roland Corporation|Roland]], which manufactured digital versions of the Rhodes without authorization from Harold Rhodes. In the 1990s, the instrument experienced a resurgence in popularity, resulting in Rhodes re-obtaining the rights to the piano in 1997. Although Harold Rhodes died in 2000, the Rhodes piano has since been reissued, and his teaching methods are still in use.\n\n==Features==\n{{multiple image |align=left |direction=vertical |width=220\n | image1   = Fender Rhodes (Inside).jpg\n | caption1 = The Rhodes piano generates its sound by hammers hitting a length of wire known as a tine.\n | image2   = Tone Generator.jpg\n | caption2 = Side view of \"tone generator assembly\", resembling a [[tuning fork]] consisting of a twisted metal tone bar and the tine below it.\n}}\n{{Listen\n|filename=Rhodes Mark I Tubeamp.ogg\n|title=Rhodes Mark I Tube amp\n|description=A ''Rhodes Mark I'' played on a [[Valve amplifier|tube amplifier]] (overdriven).\n|format=[[Ogg]]}}\nThe Rhodes piano's keyboard is laid out like a traditional acoustic piano, but some models contain 73 keys instead of 88.{{sfn|Vail|2000|p=266}} The keyboard's touch and action is designed to be like an acoustic piano. Pressing a key results in a hammer striking a thin metal rod called a tine connected to a larger \"tone bar\". The tone generator assembly acts as a [[tuning fork]] as the tone bar reinforces and extending the tine's vibrations. A [[Pickup (music technology)|pickup]] sits opposite the tine, inducing an [[electric current]] from the vibrations like an electric guitar.{{sfn|Baerman|2003|p=52}} Simply hitting tines does not need an external [[power supply]], and a Rhodes will make sound even when not plugged into an [[amplifier]],{{sfn|Brice|2001|p=104}} though like an unplugged electric guitar the sound will be weak.<ref name=\"logic\">{{cite web|url=http://documentation.apple.com/en/logicstudio/instruments/index.html#chapter=9%26section=9%26tasks=true|title=Electric Piano Models Emulated by the EVP88|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]|accessdate=January 30, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe Suitcase model Rhodes includes a built-in power amplifier and a [[tremolo]] feature that bounces the output signal from the piano across two speakers.{{sfn|Gibson|1997|p=114}} This feature is inaccurately labeled \"[[vibrato]]\" (which is a variation in pitch) on some models to be consistent with the labelling on [[Fender Amplifiers|Fender amplifiers]].{{sfn|Vail|2000|p=266}}\n\nAlthough the Rhodes functions mechanically like a piano, its sound is very different.{{sfn|Gibson|1997|p=114}} Vibrating tines produce a mellower timbre,{{sfn|Gibson|1997|p=55}} and the sound changes with the tine's relative position to the pickup. Putting the two close together gives a characteristic \"bell\" sound.<ref name=\"logic\"/> The instrument has been compared with the [[Wurlitzer electric piano]], which uses a similar technology, but with the hammers striking metal reeds. The Rhodes has a better sustain, while the Wurlitzer produces significant [[harmonic]]s when the keys are played hard, giving it a \"bite\".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/dec12/articles/arturia-wurlitzer-v.htm|title=Arturia Wurlitzer V|first=Gordon|last=Reid|magazine=[[Sound on Sound]]|date=December 2012|accessdate=January 30, 2014}}</ref>\n{{clear left}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Early models===\n[[File:Prepiano.png|thumb|An early version of the Rhodes piano, used for teaching]]\n[[Harold Rhodes (inventor)|Harold Rhodes]] started teaching piano when he was 19.

Fender disliked the higher tones of the Pre-Piano, and decided to manufacture a [[keyboard bass]] using the bottom 32 notes, known as the \"Piano Bass\". The instrument introduced the design that would become common to subsequent Rhodes pianos, with the same [[tolex]] body as Fender amplifiers and a [[fiberglass]] top. The tops came from a boat manufacturer who supplied whatever color happened to be available; consequently a number of different colored piano basses were produced.{{sfn|Vail|2000|p=266}}\n\n===Under CBS===\n[[File:6f 1.png|thumb|A 1960s 73-note Fender Rhodes Electric Piano]]\nFender was bought by [[CBS]] in 1965.<ref name=\"DayBurns36\">{{cite book\n| last = Day | first = Paul\n| title = The Burns Book\n| publisher = pp Publishing\n| year = 1979 | page = 36 \n}}</ref> Rhodes stayed with the company, and released the first Fender Rhodes piano, a 73-note model. The instrument comprised parts&nbsp;\u2014 the piano, and a separate enclosure underneath containing the power amplifier and loudspeaker. Like the piano bass, it was finished in black tolex, and had a fiberglass top.{{sfn|Vail|2000|p=266}} During the late 1960s, two models of the Fender Rhodes Celeste also became available, which used the top three or four octaves, respectively, of the Fender Rhodes piano. The Celeste did not sell well and is now hard to find.{{sfn|Vail|2000|p=266}}\n\nThe Student and Instructor models were also introduced in the late 1960s. They were designed to teach the piano in the classroom. By connecting the output of a network of student models, the teacher could listen to each student in isolation on the instructor model, and send an audio [[backing track]] to them. This allowed the teacher to monitor individual students' progress.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.magnetmagazine.com/2010/10/03/pete-yorn-is-thinking-of-fender-rhodes/|title=Fender Rhodes|first=Pete|last=Yorn|work=Magnet|date=October 3, 2010|accessdate=January 30, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 1970, the 73-note Stage Piano was introduced as a lighter and more portable alternative to the existing two-piece style,<ref name=\"obit\"/> featuring four detachable legs (used in Fender steel pedal guitars), a sustain pedal and a single output jack.{{sfn|Vail|2000|p=266-67}} Although the Stage could be used with any amplifier, catalogs suggested the use of the [[Fender Twin Reverb]].<ref name=\"em\">{{cite journal|year=2002|title=Rhodes Piano|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a3IJAQAAMAAJ|publisher=Polyphony Publishing Company|volume=18|issue=1\u20134|work=Electronic Musician}}</ref> The older style piano continued to be sold alongside the Stage and was renamed the Suitcase Piano,{{sfn|Vail|2000|p=266-67}} with 88-note models also available.{{sfn|Shepherd|2003|p=301}}\n\n===Later models===\n[[File:Rhodes Mark V.jpg|thumb|The Rhodes Mk V was the last model released by the original Rhodes corporation.|alt=]]\nDuring the 1970s various changes were made to the Rhodes' mechanics.{{sfn|Vail|2000|p=267}} In 1969 the hammer tips were changed to neoprene rubber instead of felt, to avoid the excessive need for regular maintenance, while in 1975 harp supports were changed from wood to aluminum.

The instrument was unreliable with a problematic production, particularly when a shipment of 150 units to Japan caused interference with local television reception.

Here the argument is chosen in such a way that a continuous function is obtained and <math>\\theta(0)=0</math> holds, i.e., in the same way that the [[principal branch]] of the [[Gamma function#The log-gamma function|log-Gamma]] function is defined.\n\nIt has an [[asymptotic expansion]]\n\n:<math>\\theta(t) \\sim \\frac{t}{2}\\log \\frac{t}{2\\pi} - \\frac{t}{2} - \\frac{\\pi}{8}+\\frac{1}{48t}+ \\frac{7}{5760t^3}+\\cdots</math>\n\nwhich is not convergent, but whose first few terms give a good approximation for <math>t \\gg 1</math>. Its Taylor-series at 0 which converges for <math>|t| < 1/2</math> is\n\n: <math>\\theta(t) = -\\frac{t}{2} \\log \\pi + \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^k \\psi^{(2k)}\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) }{(2k+1)!} \\left(\\frac{t}{2}\\right)^{2k+1}</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\psi^{(2k)}</math> denotes the [[Polygamma function]] of order <math>2k</math>.\nThe Riemann\u2013Siegel theta function is of interest in studying the [[Riemann zeta function]], since it can rotate the Riemann zeta function such that it becomes the totally real valued [[Z function]] on the [[critical line (mathematics)|critical line]] <math>s = 1/2 + i t</math> .\n\n== Curve discussion ==\n\nThe Riemann\u2013Siegel theta function is an odd [[real analytic function]] for real values of ''t''. It has three roots at 0 and <math>\\pm 17.8455995405\\ldots</math> and it is an increasing function for values |''t''| > 6.29, because it has exactly one minima and one maxima at <math>\\pm 6.289835988\\ldots</math> with absolute value <math>\n3.530972829\\ldots</math>. Lastly it has a unique inflection point at t=0 with <math>\\theta^\\prime(0)= -\\frac{\\ln \\pi + \\gamma + \\pi/2 + 3 \\ln 2}{2} = -2.6860917\\ldots</math> where the theta function has its derivation minimum.\n\n==Theta as a function of a complex variable==\nWe have an infinite series expression for the [[Gamma function#The log-gamma function|log-Gamma]] function\n\n:<math>\\log \\Gamma \\left(z\\right) = -\\gamma z -\\log z  \n+ \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \n\\left(\\frac{z}{n} - \\log \\left(1+\\frac{z}{n}\\right)\\right),</math>\n\nwhere ''\u03b3'' is [[Euler\u2013Mascheroni constant|Euler's constant]]. Substituting <math>(2it+1)/4</math> for ''z'' and taking the imaginary part termwise gives the following series for ''\u03b8''(''t'')\n\n:<math>\\theta(t) = -\\frac{\\gamma + \\log \\pi}{2}t - \\arctan 2t + \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\left(\\frac{t}{2n} - \\arctan\\left(\\frac{2t}{4n+1}\\right)\\right).</math>\n\nFor values with imaginary part between \u22121 and 1, the arctangent function is [[holomorphic function|holomorphic]], and it is easily seen that the series converges uniformly on compact sets in the region with imaginary part between \u22121/2 and 1/2, leading to a holomorphic function on this domain. It follows that the [[Z function]] is also holomorphic in this region, which is the critical strip.\n\nWe may use the identities\n\n:<math>\\arg z = \\frac{\\log z - \\log\\bar z}{2i}\\quad\\text{and}\\quad\\overline{\\Gamma(z)}=\\Gamma(\\bar z)</math>\n\nto obtain the closed-form expression\n\n:<math>\\theta(t) = \\frac{\\log\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{2it+1}{4}\\right)-\\log\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{-2it+1}{4}\\right)}{2i} - \\frac{\\log \\pi}{2} t=- \\frac{i}{2} \\left( \\ln \\Gamma \\left( \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{i t}{2} \\right) -\n\\ln \\Gamma \\left( \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{i t}{2} \\right) \\right) - \\frac{\\ln (\\pi) t}{2}</math>\n\nwhich extends our original definition to a holomorphic function of ''t''.

Located in the [[Dras|Drass]], the pass connects the [[Kashmir Valley]] to its west with the [[Dras|Drass]] and [[Suru valley|Suru]] valleys to its northeast and the [[Indus River|Indus]] valley further east.\n\nThe [[National Highway 1 (India)|National Highway 1]] between [[Srinagar]] and [[Leh]] in the western section of the [[Himalaya]]n mountain range traverses the pass. Since vehicle flow stops during winter every year due to heavy snowfall, the all weather [[Zoji-la Tunnel]] is being constructed to mitigate this.\n\n==Etymology==\nZoji La means the \"mountain pass of blizzards\".<ref name=zojitank1>[https://theprint.in/defence/zojila-battle-of-1948-when-indians-surprised-pakistan-with-tanks-at-11553-ft/314474/ Zojila battle of 1948 \u2014 when Indians surprised Pakistan with tanks at 11,553 ft], The Print, 1 November 2019.</ref>\n\nIt is sometimes referred to as \"Zojila Pass\" which is a [[misnomer]] and the suffix \"Pass\" is redundant because the word \"La\" itself means a mountain pass in Tibetan, Ladakhi and several languages spoken in the Himalayan region. Other examples are [[Nathu La]] on Sikkim-Tibet border, [[Baralacha la|Baralacha La]] on [[Leh-Manali Highway]], [[Khardung La]], [[Fotu La]], Namika La and [[Pensi La]], to name only a few.\n\n==Location==\n\nZoji La is about 100&nbsp;km from [[Srinagar]], the capital of the Union territory of Jammu and Kashmir, and 15&nbsp;km from [[Sonamarg|Sonmarg]]. It provides a vital link between [[Ladakh]] and Kashmir Valley. It runs at an elevation of approximately {{convert|3528|m|ft|0}}, and is the second highest pass after [[Fotu La]] on the Srinagar-Leh National Highway. It is often closed during winter, though the [[Border Roads Organisation]] (BRO) is working to extend traffic to more period in winter.

There was some variation in the design of the bridge and superstructure arrangements; the bridge could be either amidships or at the rear; the engine and fuel-coal bunkers could be amidships or toward the rear.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flotilla-australia.com/coal.htm|title=FLOTILLA AUSTRALIA|website=www.flotilla-australia.com|access-date=2018-09-26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.shf.org.au/archives-research/photographic-collections/the-davidson-collection/coasters-and-colliers/|title=Coasters and Colliers - Sydney Heritage Fleet|website=www.shf.org.au|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-29}}</ref> Depending on the arrangement of the superstructure, the ships had either two of three masts.

The ''Hexham Bank'' may have been described as an 'R.W. Miller' ship when in fact it was on charter from its actual owners [[McIlwraith, McEacharn & Co|McIlwraith McEacharn]] of Melbourne, which itself owned and operated other similarly named 'sixty-milers' (''Mortlake Bank, Pelton Bank and Hetton Bank''). R.W. Miller not only chartered ships like the ''Hexham Bank'' but also owned its own ships such as the ''Birchgrove Park''. \n\nThe southern coalfield collieries (Coalcliff Collieries, etc.) owned their own ships but most of these were chartered to the Southern Coal Owner's Agency, which operated the ships. Some coal merchants, such as Jones Brothers' Coal, owned their own ships<ref name=\":26\">{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article16419057|title=COAL TRADE.|date=1927-11-15|work=Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842 - 1954)|access-date=2020-03-22|pages=12}}</ref> \n\nShips of course were bought and sold, and changed ownership, while still carrying coal cargoes for their new owners.Sometimes, a change in ownership also resulted in a ship's name changing, such as when ''Corrimal'' was renamed ''Ayrfield'' or when ''South Bulli'' became ''Abersea''.<ref name=\":26\" /> There were many owners up to the middle of 20th-Century, sometimes just owning or operating on charter just one vessel. These complexities, together with the cross-ownership, mergers and takeovers that took place in the coal and coastal shipping companies, sometimes makes it hard to follow the owners and operators of particular vessels.\n\n=== Operation and crewing ===\nDue to the short distances between Sydney and the coal ports, and for commercial reasons, the 'sixty-milers' made frequent trips of short duration, carrying coal to Sydney and in ballast for the return trip.\n\nThe coal cargo was stored in the holds in bulk and needed to be \"trimmed\" to ensure that its distribution did not result in a list to one side or the other. Typically, trimming was done by the ship's crew, although depending on the sophistication of the loading arrangements coal was loaded in such a way as to minimise the need for trimming.\n\nThe ships could be loaded relatively quickly<ref name=\":19\">{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article15099181|title=RECORD COAL LOADING.|date=1909-07-10|work=Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842 - 1954)|access-date=2018-09-23|pages=13}}</ref> and be at sea in time to complete the trip to Sydney from Newcastle in six or so hours;<ref name=\":18\" /> it would take longer in bad weather. Operation of the 'sixty-milers' was typically six-days per week and around the clock.<ref name=\":17\" />\n\nA crew of 10 to 16 was typical, depending upon the size of the ship. A crew of a 'sixty-miler' (1919) would include a master, two mates, two engineers, a donkeyman, two firemen, four to six seamen, a cook and a steward.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Incidents, losses and inquiries ==\nOver the years of the coastal coal-carrying trade, many 'sixty-milers' were wrecked, involved in collisions with other ships, or foundered. A common factor in most of the losses of 'sixty milers' was bad weather. In some losses, a factor seemed to be a haste to put to sea and get the cargo to Sydney. Another factor was the use of ocean jetties at some coal loading ports.\n\n=== Hazards of ocean jetties ===\n[[File:Coalcliff Jetty (4903254981).jpg|thumb|286x286px|[[Coalcliff#History#Coal Mine and Jetty|Coalcliff Jetty]] - the smallest and most exposed of the ocean jetties<ref name=\"1934- 1984 2\"/> (Tyrrell Photographic Collection, [[Powerhouse Museum]])]]\nThe waters in which the ocean jetties were located were in nautical parlance called \"open roadsteads\", meaning \"an area near the shore where vessels anchor with relatively little protection from the sea.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/open+roadstead|title=open roadstead|work=TheFreeDictionary.com|access-date=2018-09-22}}</ref> Ocean jetties typically were  located so as to have some natural protection from the south, against the common \"[[southerly buster]]\". While somewhat protected from the south, all the ocean jetties were exposed to the \"[[black nor'easter]]\", a violent storm that can arise quickly.<ref name=\":1\" /> The rocky reefs that provided protection from one direction would themselves become a hazard,when the weather was from the opposite direction.\n\nThe loading operation at an ocean jetty itself could be hazardous. In the days before moveable loaders, the ship needed to be repositioned under the fixed loading chutes, either to change hatches or to reduce the amount of trimming needed. All this, while in shallow water and close to a rocky shore or beach, made working the jetty ports hazardous.\n\nOcean jetty ports were more hazardous for sailing vessels than for the more manoeverable steamships. Yet, in the earlier years of the coastal trade, coal was mainly shipped on sailing vessels. The perils of these operations were shown by the events of the night of 7 September 1867, when two [[barque]]s\u2014''Matador'' and ''Bright Planet''\u2014were blown ashore and wrecked at [[Bulli Jetty, Sandon Point, New South Wales|Bulli]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13158007|title=WRECKS.|date=1867-09-21|work=Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842 - 1954)|access-date=2018-11-07|pages=9}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article60844651|title=DISASTERS AT BULLI.|date=1867-09-10|work=Empire (Sydney, NSW : 1850 - 1875)|access-date=2018-11-07|pages=4}}</ref>  \n[[File:Wallarah Jetty, Catherine Hill Bay (6809552821).jpg|thumb|285x285px|Jetty at [[Catherine Hill Bay]], with a small 'sixty-miler' alongside.

The ''Hexham Bank'' may have been described as an 'R.W. Miller' ship when in fact it was on charter from its actual owners [[McIlwraith, McEacharn & Co|McIlwraith McEacharn]] of Melbourne, which itself owned and operated other similarly named 'sixty-milers' (''Mortlake Bank, Pelton Bank and Hetton Bank''). R.W. Miller not only chartered ships like the ''Hexham Bank'' but also owned its own ships such as the ''Birchgrove Park''. \n\nThe southern coalfield collieries (Coalcliff Collieries, etc.) owned their own ships but most of these were chartered to the Southern Coal Owner's Agency, which operated the ships. Some coal merchants, such as Jones Brothers' Coal, owned their own ships<ref name=\":26\">{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article16419057|title=COAL TRADE.|date=1927-11-15|work=Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842 - 1954)|access-date=2020-03-22|pages=12}}</ref> \n\nShips of course were bought and sold, and changed ownership, while still carrying coal cargoes for their new owners.Sometimes, a change in ownership also resulted in a ship's name changing, such as when ''Corrimal'' was renamed ''Ayrfield'' or when ''South Bulli'' became ''Abersea''.<ref name=\":26\" /> There were many owners up to the middle of 20th-Century, sometimes just owning or operating on charter just one vessel. These complexities, together with the cross-ownership, mergers and takeovers that took place in the coal and coastal shipping companies, sometimes makes it hard to follow the owners and operators of particular vessels.\n\n=== Operation and crewing ===\nDue to the short distances between Sydney and the coal ports, and for commercial reasons, the 'sixty-milers' made frequent trips of short duration, carrying coal to Sydney and in ballast for the return trip.\n\nThe coal cargo was stored in the holds in bulk and needed to be \"trimmed\" to ensure that its distribution did not result in a list to one side or the other. Typically, trimming was done by the ship's crew, although depending on the sophistication of the loading arrangements coal was loaded in such a way as to minimise the need for trimming.\n\nThe ships could be loaded relatively quickly<ref name=\":19\">{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article15099181|title=RECORD COAL LOADING.|date=1909-07-10|work=Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842 - 1954)|access-date=2018-09-23|pages=13}}</ref> and be at sea in time to complete the trip to Sydney from Newcastle in six or so hours;<ref name=\":18\" /> it would take longer in bad weather. Operation of the 'sixty-milers' was typically six-days per week and around the clock.<ref name=\":17\" />\n\nA crew of 10 to 16 was typical, depending upon the size of the ship. A crew of a 'sixty-miler' (1919) would include a master, two mates, two engineers, a donkeyman, two firemen, four to six seamen, a cook and a steward.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Incidents, losses and inquiries ==\nOver the years of the coastal coal-carrying trade, many 'sixty-milers' were wrecked, involved in collisions with other ships, or foundered. A common factor in most of the losses of 'sixty milers' was bad weather. In some losses, a factor seemed to be a haste to put to sea and get the cargo to Sydney. Another factor was the use of ocean jetties at some coal loading ports.\n\n=== Hazards of ocean jetties ===\n[[File:Coalcliff Jetty (4903254981).jpg|thumb|286x286px|[[Coalcliff#History#Coal Mine and Jetty|Coalcliff Jetty]] - the smallest and most exposed of the ocean jetties<ref name=\"1934- 1984 2\"/> (Tyrrell Photographic Collection, [[Powerhouse Museum]])]]\nThe waters in which the ocean jetties were located were in nautical parlance called \"open roadsteads\", meaning \"an area near the shore where vessels anchor with relatively little protection from the sea.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/open+roadstead|title=open roadstead|work=TheFreeDictionary.com|access-date=2018-09-22}}</ref> Ocean jetties typically were  located so as to have some natural protection from the south, against the common \"[[southerly buster]]\". While somewhat protected from the south, all the ocean jetties were exposed to the \"[[black nor'easter]]\", a violent storm that can arise quickly.<ref name=\":1\" /> The rocky reefs that provided protection from one direction would themselves become a hazard,when the weather was from the opposite direction.\n\nThe loading operation at an ocean jetty itself could be hazardous. In the days before moveable loaders, the ship needed to be repositioned under the fixed loading chutes, either to change hatches or to reduce the amount of trimming needed. All this, while in shallow water and close to a rocky shore or beach, made working the jetty ports hazardous.\n\nOcean jetty ports were more hazardous for sailing vessels than for the more manoeverable steamships. Yet, in the earlier years of the coastal trade, coal was mainly shipped on sailing vessels. The perils of these operations were shown by the events of the night of 7 September 1867, when two [[barque]]s\u2014''Matador'' and ''Bright Planet''\u2014were blown ashore and wrecked at [[Bulli Jetty, Sandon Point, New South Wales|Bulli]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13158007|title=WRECKS.|date=1867-09-21|work=Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842 - 1954)|access-date=2018-11-07|pages=9}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article60844651|title=DISASTERS AT BULLI.|date=1867-09-10|work=Empire (Sydney, NSW : 1850 - 1875)|access-date=2018-11-07|pages=4}}</ref>  \n[[File:Wallarah Jetty, Catherine Hill Bay (6809552821).jpg|thumb|285x285px|Jetty at [[Catherine Hill Bay]], with a small 'sixty-miler' alongside.

Miller,'' her sister ship the ''Birchgrove Park'', served from 1931 until she became the last 'sixty-miler' to founder in 1956. Only four of the fourteen crew of the ''Birchgrove Park'' survived. They told of how Captain Laurence Lynch had refused to seek the shelter of [[Broken Bay]] during a storm but had pressed on, toward Sydney, before the vessel foundered off the northern beaches of Sydney. The survivors also told how the pumps were not started until there was too much free water in the hold, leaking in from a damaged part of the aged ship. The survivors also told of how the ship's radio aerial was not in place, and they had to use their signal lamp to contact the [[Macquarie Lighthouse|South Head Lighthouse]] when the ship was in distress. This absence of radio contact and the search being made too far south of the ship's last location led to a greater loss of life than otherwise might have been the case. The loss of the ''Birchgrove Park'' forms a part of the narrative of a book\u2014\"The Sixty-Miler\"\u2014written by Norma Sim, the widow of Bill Sim, one men lost with the ''Birchgrove Park''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/4351846|title=The sixty miler: a story of love and the sea|last=Sim|first=Norma|date=2008|publisher=Pier 9|isbn=9781741962239|location=Millers Point, N.S.W}}</ref>\n\nOne of the most modern of the 'sixty-milers', the ''MV Stephen Brown''\u2014built in 1954\u2014nearly came to grief, when some air-vents that had been closed off and some of the deck hatches lost their covers in the stormy seas. She began to fill, with the water gradually entering her holds and developed a list. The hull sides at deck level began to go underwater, a circumstance very similar to that in the foundering of other 'sixty-milers'. The ''MV Stephen Brown'' made it through the heads into Sydney Harbour and Captain Don Turner initially proposed to beach her at Lady Jane Beach ([[Watsons Bay, New South Wales|Lady Bay Beach]]) just inside [[Sydney Heads#South Head|South Head]]. That proved unnecessary. Instead the ship stood off the beach pumping out some of the water. She was then able to discharge her cargo at the CSR wharf at [[Pyrmont, New South Wales|Pyrmont]] as intended. The ''MV Stephen Brown'' was probably saved only by her great stability.
