{"title_page": "Natural units", "text_new": "{{short description|Physical units of measurement based only on universal physical constants}}\nIn [[physics]], '''natural units''' are [[physical units]] of [[measurement]] based only on universal [[physical constants]]. For example, the [[elementary charge]] {{math|''e''}} is a natural unit of [[electric charge]], and the [[speed of light]] {{math|''c''}} is a natural unit of [[speed]]. A purely natural [[system of units]] has all of its units defined in this way, and usually such that the numerical values of the selected physical constants in terms of these units are exactly {{math|1}}. These constants are then typically omitted from mathematical expressions of physical laws, and while this has the apparent advantage of simplicity, it may entail a loss of clarity due to the loss of information for [[dimensional analysis]]. It precludes the interpretation of an expression in terms of fundamental physical constants, such as {{mvar|e}} and {{mvar|c}}, unless it is ''known'' which units (in dimensionful units) the expression is supposed to have. In this case, the reinsertion of the correct powers of {{math|''e''}}, {{math|''c''}}, etc., can be uniquely determined.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PP5G20ImveU What are natural units?], [[Sabine Hossenfelder]], 2011-11-07.</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaN8uM_2_sk Planck Units \u2013 Part 1 of 3], DrPhysicistA, 2012-02-14.</ref>\n\n==Introduction==\nNatural units are intended to [[Nondimensionalization| simplify]] particular equations appearing in the laws of physics or to [[Normalizing constant|normalize]] some chosen physical quantities that are properties of universal [[elementary particle]]s and are reasonably believed to be constant. However, there is a choice of which quantities to set to unity in a natural system of units, and quantities which are set to unity in one system may take a different value or even be assumed to vary in another natural unit system.\n\nNatural units are \"natural\" because the origin of their definition comes only from properties of [[nature]] and not from any human construct. [[Planck units]] are often, without qualification, called \"natural units\", although they constitute only one of several systems of natural units, albeit the best known such system. Planck units (up to a simple multiplier for each unit) might be considered one of the most \"natural\" systems in that the set of units is not based on properties of any [[prototype]], object, or [[subatomic particle|particle]] but are solely derived from the properties of [[free space]]. \n\nDimensioned physical constants may be thought of as conversion factors between inconsistent, rather arbitrary \"human-constructed\" units of measure. For example, spatial distance may be measured in terms of the rather arbitrary unit of the meter and time may be measured in terms of the rather arbitrary unit of the second. In [[Special relativity|relativity theory]], no distinction is drawn between space-like distances and time-like distances, and so the speed of light is a conversion factor between the meter and the second. Likewise, the [[Avogadro number]] is a conversion factor between quantities measured in particle number and in [[Mole (unit)|mole]]s (which are in turn defined by the rather arbitrary mass unit of the gram). The universal [[gas constant]] is simply Boltzmann's constant when quantity is measured in moles, and [[Boltzmann's constant]] may be thought of as a conversion factor between energy measured in, say, [[Joule]]s and in [[Kelvin]], and also (controversially) as a conversion factor between [[Entropy|thermodynamic entropy]] and [[Entropy (information theory)|information entropy]].\n\nAs with other [[systems of units]], the base units of a set of natural units will include definitions and values for [[length]], [[mass]], [[time]], [[temperature]], and [[electric charge]] (in lieu of [[electric current]]). It is possible to disregard temperature as a [[fundamental units|fundamental physical quantity]], since it states the energy per degree of freedom of a particle, which can be expressed in terms of energy (or mass, length, and time). Virtually every system of natural units normalizes [[Boltzmann's constant]] {{math|''k''<sub>B</sub>}} to 1, which can be thought of as simply a way of defining the unit of temperature.\n\nIn [[SI]], electric charge is a separate fundamental dimension of physical quantity, but in natural unit systems charge is expressed in terms of the mechanical units of mass, length, and time, similarly to [[cgs]]. There are two common ways to relate charge to mass, length, and time: In [[Lorentz\u2013Heaviside units]] (also called \"rationalized\"), [[Coulomb's law]] is {{math|1=''F'' = {{sfrac|''q''<sub>1</sub>''q''<sub>2</sub>|4\u03c0''r''<sup>2</sup>}}}}, and in [[Gaussian units]] (also called \"non-rationalized\"), Coulomb's law is {{math|1=''F'' = {{sfrac|''q''<sub>1</sub>''q''<sub>2</sub>|''r''<sup>2</sup>}}}}.<ref>Kowalski, Ludwik, 1986, \"[http://alpha.montclair.edu/~kowalskiL/SI/SI_PAGE.HTML A Short History of the SI Units in Electricity,] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429035624/http://alpha.montclair.edu/~kowalskiL/SI/SI_PAGE.HTML |date=2009-04-29 }}\" ''The Physics Teacher'' 24(2): 97\u201399.

For example, many natural unit systems include the equation {{math|1=''c'' = 1}} in the unit-system definition, where {{math|''c''}} is the [[speed of light]]. If a velocity {{math|''v''}} is half the speed of light, then as {{math|1=''v'' = {{sfrac|''c''|2}}}} and {{math|1=''c'' = 1}}, hence {{math|1=''v'' = {{sfrac|1|2}}}}. The equation {{math|1=''v'' = {{sfrac|1|2}}}} means \"the velocity {{math|''v''}} has the value one-half when measured in Planck units\", or \"the velocity {{math|''v''}} is one-half the Planck unit of velocity\".\n\nThe equation {{math|1=''c'' = 1}} can be plugged in anywhere else. For example, Einstein's equation {{math|1=''E'' = ''mc''<sup>2</sup>}} can be rewritten in Planck units as {{math|1=''E'' = ''m''}}. This equation means \"The energy of a particle, measured in Planck units of energy, equals the mass of the particle, measured in Planck units of mass.\"\n\n=== Advantages and disadvantages ===\nCompared to [[SI]] or other unit systems, natural units have both advantages and disadvantages:\n\n*'''Simplified equations:''' By setting constants to 1, equations containing those constants appear more compact and in some cases may be simpler to understand. For example, the [[invariant mass|special relativity]] equation {{math|1=''E''<sup>2</sup> = ''p''<sup>2</sup>''c''<sup>2</sup> + ''m''<sup>2</sup>''c''<sup>4</sup>}} appears somewhat complicated, but the natural units version, {{math|1=''E''<sup>2</sup> = ''p''<sup>2</sup> + ''m''<sup>2</sup>}}, appears simpler.\n*'''Physical interpretation:''' Space and time are put on equal footing and are both measured in the same units. Natural unit systems automatically subsume [[dimensional analysis]]. For example, in [[Planck units]], the units are defined by properties of quantum mechanics and gravity. Not coincidentally, the Planck unit of length is approximately the distance at which [[quantum gravity]] effects become important. Likewise, [[atomic units]] are based on the mass and charge of an electron, and not coincidentally the atomic unit of length is the [[Bohr radius]] describing the \"orbit\" of the electron in a [[hydrogen atom]].\n*'''No prototypes:''' A [[Prototype#Metrology|prototype]] is a physical object that defines a unit, such as the [[International Prototype of the Kilogram]], a physical cylinder of metal whose mass used to be by definition exactly one [[kilogram]] (as of 2019 one kilogram is instead defined [[2019 redefinition of the SI base units|in terms of fundamental constants]]). A prototype definition always has imperfect reproducibility between different places and between different times, and it is an advantage of natural unit systems that they use no prototypes. (They share this advantage with some ''non-natural'' unit systems, such as [[conventional electrical units]].)\n*'''Less precise measurements:''' [[SI]] units are designed to be used in precision measurements. For example, the [[second]] is defined by an atomic transition frequency in cesium atoms, because this transition frequency can be precisely reproduced with [[atomic clock]] technology. Natural unit systems are generally ''not'' based on quantities that can be precisely reproduced in a lab. Therefore, in order to retain the same degree of precision, the fundamental constants used still have to be measured in a laboratory in terms of physical objects that can be directly observed. If this is not possible, then a quantity expressed in natural units can be less precise than the same quantity expressed in SI units. For example, Planck units use the [[gravitational constant|gravitational constant {{math|''G''}}]], which is measurable in a laboratory only to four significant digits.\n\n==Choosing constants to normalize==\nOut of the many [[physical constant]]s, the designer of a system of natural unit systems must choose a few of these constants to normalize (set equal to 1). It is not possible to normalize just ''any'' set of constants. For example, the mass of a proton and the mass of an electron cannot both be normalized: if the mass of an electron is defined to be 1, then the mass of a proton has to be approximately 1836. In a less trivial example, the [[fine-structure constant]], {{math|''\u03b1'' \u2248 {{sfrac|137}}}}, cannot be set to 1 because it is a dimensionless number defined in terms of other quantities. The fine-structure constant is related to other physical constants through {{math|''\u03b1'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''k''{{sub|e}}''e''{{sup|2}}|''\u0127c''}}}}, where {{math|''k''{{sub|e}}}} is the [[Coulomb constant]], {{math|''e''}} is the [[elementary charge]], {{math|''\u0127''}} is the [[reduced Planck constant]], and {{math|''c''}} is the [[speed of light]]. Thus, it is impossible to set all of {{math|''k''{{sub|e}}}}, {{math|''e''}}, {{math|''\u0127''}}, and {{math|''c''}} to 1; at most three of this set can be normalized to 1.\n\n==Electromagnetism units==\n{{main|Lorentz\u2013Heaviside units|Gaussian units}}\nIn [[SI units]], electric charge is expressed in coulombs, a separate unit which is additional to the \"mechanical\" units (mass, length, time), even though the traditional definition of the ampere refers to some of these other units.\n\nIn order to build natural units in electromagnetism one can use:\n*'''[[Lorentz\u2013Heaviside units]]''' (classified as a '''rationalized''' system of electromagnetism units).\n*'''[[Gaussian units]]''' (classified as a '''non-rationalized''' system of electromagnetism units).\nOf these, Lorentz\u2013Heaviside is somewhat more common,<ref name=\"GreinerNeise1995\">{{cite book|author1=Walter Greiner|author2=Ludwig Neise|author3=Horst St\u00f6cker|title=Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=12DKsFtFTgYC&pg=PA385|year=1995|publisher=Springer-Verlag|isbn=978-0-387-94299-5|page=385}}</ref> mainly because [[Maxwell's equations]] are simpler in Lorentz\u2013Heaviside units than they are in Gaussian units.\n\nIn the two unit systems, the Planck unit charge {{math|''q''<sub>P</sub>}} is:\n*{{math|''q''<sub>P</sub> {{=}} {{sqrt|4\u03c0''\u03b1\u0127c''}}}} (Lorentz\u2013Heaviside),\n*{{math|''q''<sub>P</sub> {{=}} {{sqrt|''\u03b1\u0127c''}}}} (Gaussian)\nwhere {{math|''\u0127''}} is the [[reduced Planck constant]], {{math|''c''}} is the [[speed of light]], and {{math|''\u03b1'' \u2248 {{sfrac|137.036}}}} is the [[fine-structure constant]].\n\nIn a natural unit system where {{math|1=[[speed of light|''c'']] = 1}}, Lorentz\u2013Heaviside units can be derived from SI units by setting {{math|1=[[electric constant|''\u03b5''<sub>0</sub>]] = [[magnetic constant|''\u03bc''<sub>0</sub>]] = 1}}.

This makes Planck units particularly useful and common in theories of [[quantum gravity]], including [[string theory]].\n\nPlanck units may be considered \"more natural\" even than other natural unit systems discussed below, as Planck units are not based on any arbitrarily chosen prototype object or particle. For example, some other systems use the mass of an electron as a parameter to be normalized. But the electron is just one of 16 known massive [[elementary particle]]s, all with different masses, and there is no compelling reason, within fundamental physics, to emphasize the electron mass over some other elementary particle's mass.\n\nPlanck considered only the units based on the universal constants ''G'', ''\u0127'', ''c'', and ''k''<sub>B</sub> to arrive at natural units for [[length]], [[time]], [[mass]], and [[temperature]].<ref name=\"TOM\">*Tomilin, K.

The Hartree units were first proposed by [[Douglas Hartree]], and are more common than the Rydberg units.\n\nThe units are designed especially to characterize the behavior of an electron in the ground state of a hydrogen atom. For example, using the Hartree convention, in the [[Bohr model]] of the hydrogen atom, an electron in the ground state has orbital velocity = 1, orbital radius = 1, angular momentum = 1, [[ionization energy]] = {{sfrac|2}}, etc.\n\nThe unit of [[energy]] is called the [[Hartree energy]] in the Hartree system and the [[Rydberg energy]] in the Rydberg system. They differ by a factor of 2. The [[speed of light]] is relatively large in atomic units (137 in Hartree or 274 in Rydberg), which comes from the fact that an electron in hydrogen tends to move much slower than the speed of light. The [[gravitational constant]] is extremely small in atomic units (around 10<sup>\u221245</sup>), which comes from the fact that the gravitational force between two electrons is far weaker than the [[Coulomb force]].

For example, the [[elementary charge]] {{math|''e''}} is a natural unit of [[electric charge]], and the [[speed of light]] {{math|''c''}} is a natural unit of [[speed]]. A purely natural [[system of units]] has all of its units defined in this way, and usually such that the numerical values of the selected physical constants in terms of these units are exactly {{math|1}}. These constants are then typically omitted from mathematical expressions of physical laws, and while this has the apparent advantage of simplicity, it may entail a loss of clarity due to the loss of information for [[dimensional analysis]]. It precludes the interpretation of an expression in terms of fundamental physical constants, such as {{mvar|e}} and {{mvar|c}}, unless it is ''known'' which units (in dimensionful units) the expression is supposed to have. In this case, the reinsertion of the correct powers of {{math|''e''}}, {{math|''c''}}, etc., can be uniquely determined.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PP5G20ImveU What are natural units?], [[Sabine Hossenfelder]], 2011-11-07.</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaN8uM_2_sk Planck Units \u2013 Part 1 of 3], DrPhysicistA, 2012-02-14.</ref>\n\n==Introduction==\nNatural units are intended to [[Nondimensionalization| simplify]] particular equations appearing in the laws of physics or to [[Normalizing constant|normalize]] some chosen physical quantities that are properties of universal [[elementary particle]]s and are reasonably believed to be constant. However, there is a choice of which quantities to set to unity in a natural system of units, and quantities which are set to unity in one system may take a different value or even be assumed to vary in another natural unit system.\n\nNatural units are \"natural\" because the origin of their definition comes only from properties of [[nature]] and not from any human construct. [[Planck units]] are often, without qualification, called \"natural units\", although they constitute only one of several systems of natural units, albeit the best known such system. Planck units (up to a simple multiplier for each unit) might be considered one of the most \"natural\" systems in that the set of units is not based on properties of any [[prototype]], object, or [[subatomic particle|particle]] but are solely derived from the properties of [[free space]]. \n\nDimensioned physical constants may be thought of as conversion factors between inconsistent, rather arbitrary \"human-constructed\" units of measure. For example, spatial distance may be measured in terms of the rather arbitrary unit of the meter and time may be measured in terms of the rather arbitrary unit of the second. In [[Special relativity|relativity theory]], no distinction is drawn between space-like distances and time-like distances, and so the speed of light is a conversion factor between the meter and the second. Likewise, the [[Avogadro number]] is a conversion factor between quantities measured in particle number and in [[Mole (unit)|mole]]s (which are in turn defined by the rather arbitrary mass unit of the gram). The universal [[gas constant]] is simply Boltzmann's constant when quantity is measured in moles, and [[Boltzmann's constant]] may be thought of as a conversion factor between energy measured in, say, [[Joule]]s and in [[Kelvin]], and also (controversially) as a conversion factor between [[Entropy|thermodynamic entropy]] and [[Entropy (information theory)|information entropy]].\n\nAs with other [[systems of units]], the base units of a set of natural units will include definitions and values for [[length]], [[mass]], [[time]], [[temperature]], and [[electric charge]] (in lieu of [[electric current]]). It is possible to disregard temperature as a [[fundamental units|fundamental physical quantity]], since it states the energy per degree of freedom of a particle, which can be expressed in terms of energy (or mass, length, and time). Virtually every system of natural units normalizes [[Boltzmann's constant]] {{math|''k''<sub>B</sub>}} to 1, which can be thought of as simply a way of defining the unit of temperature.\n\nIn [[SI]], electric charge is a separate fundamental dimension of physical quantity, but in natural unit systems charge is expressed in terms of the mechanical units of mass, length, and time, similarly to [[cgs]]. There are two common ways to relate charge to mass, length, and time: In [[Lorentz\u2013Heaviside units]] (also called \"rationalized\"), [[Coulomb's law]] is {{math|1=''F'' = {{sfrac|''q''<sub>1</sub>''q''<sub>2</sub>|4\u03c0''r''<sup>2</sup>}}}}, and in [[Gaussian units]] (also called \"non-rationalized\"), Coulomb's law is {{math|1=''F'' = {{sfrac|''q''<sub>1</sub>''q''<sub>2</sub>|''r''<sup>2</sup>}}}}.<ref>Kowalski, Ludwik, 1986, \"[http://alpha.montclair.edu/~kowalskiL/SI/SI_PAGE.HTML A Short History of the SI Units in Electricity,] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429035624/http://alpha.montclair.edu/~kowalskiL/SI/SI_PAGE.HTML |date=2009-04-29 }}\" ''The Physics Teacher'' 24(2): 97\u201399.

For example, many natural unit systems include the equation {{math|1=''c'' = 1}} in the unit-system definition, where {{math|''c''}} is the [[speed of light]]. If a velocity {{math|''v''}} is half the speed of light, then as {{math|1=''v'' = {{sfrac|''c''|2}}}} and {{math|1=''c'' = 1}}, hence {{math|1=''v'' = {{sfrac|1|2}}}}. The equation {{math|1=''v'' = {{sfrac|1|2}}}} means \"the velocity {{math|''v''}} has the value one-half when measured in Planck units\", or \"the velocity {{math|''v''}} is one-half the Planck unit of velocity\".\n\nThe equation {{math|1=''c'' = 1}} can be plugged in anywhere else. For example, Einstein's equation {{math|1=''E'' = ''mc''<sup>2</sup>}} can be rewritten in Planck units as {{math|1=''E'' = ''m''}}. This equation means \"The energy of a particle, measured in Planck units of energy, equals the mass of the particle, measured in Planck units of mass.\"\n\n=== Advantages and disadvantages ===\nCompared to [[SI]] or other unit systems, natural units have both advantages and disadvantages:\n\n*'''Simplified equations:''' By setting constants to 1, equations containing those constants appear more compact and in some cases may be simpler to understand. For example, the [[invariant mass|special relativity]] equation {{math|1=''E''<sup>2</sup> = ''p''<sup>2</sup>''c''<sup>2</sup> + ''m''<sup>2</sup>''c''<sup>4</sup>}} appears somewhat complicated, but the natural units version, {{math|1=''E''<sup>2</sup> = ''p''<sup>2</sup> + ''m''<sup>2</sup>}}, appears simpler.\n*'''Physical interpretation:''' Space and time are put on equal footing and are both measured in the same units. Natural unit systems automatically subsume [[dimensional analysis]]. For example, in [[Planck units]], the units are defined by properties of quantum mechanics and gravity. Not coincidentally, the Planck unit of length is approximately the distance at which [[quantum gravity]] effects become important. Likewise, [[atomic units]] are based on the mass and charge of an electron, and not coincidentally the atomic unit of length is the [[Bohr radius]] describing the \"orbit\" of the electron in a [[hydrogen atom]].\n*'''No prototypes:''' A [[Prototype#Metrology|prototype]] is a physical object that defines a unit, such as the [[International Prototype of the Kilogram]], a physical cylinder of metal whose mass used to be by definition exactly one [[kilogram]] (as of 2019 one kilogram is instead defined [[2019 redefinition of the SI base units|in terms of fundamental constants]]). A prototype definition always has imperfect reproducibility between different places and between different times, and it is an advantage of natural unit systems that they use no prototypes. (They share this advantage with some ''non-natural'' unit systems, such as [[conventional electrical units]].)\n*'''Less precise measurements:''' [[SI]] units are designed to be used in precision measurements. For example, the [[second]] is defined by an atomic transition frequency in cesium atoms, because this transition frequency can be precisely reproduced with [[atomic clock]] technology. Natural unit systems are generally ''not'' based on quantities that can be precisely reproduced in a lab. Therefore, in order to retain the same degree of precision, the fundamental constants used still have to be measured in a laboratory in terms of physical objects that can be directly observed. If this is not possible, then a quantity expressed in natural units can be less precise than the same quantity expressed in SI units. For example, Planck units use the [[gravitational constant|gravitational constant {{math|''G''}}]], which is measurable in a laboratory only to four significant digits.\n\n==Choosing constants to normalize==\nOut of the many [[physical constant]]s, the designer of a system of natural unit systems must choose a few of these constants to normalize (set equal to 1). It is not possible to normalize just ''any'' set of constants. For example, the mass of a proton and the mass of an electron cannot both be normalized: if the mass of an electron is defined to be 1, then the mass of a proton has to be approximately 1836. In a less trivial example, the [[fine-structure constant]], {{math|''\u03b1'' \u2248 {{sfrac|137}}}}, cannot be set to 1 because it is a dimensionless number defined in terms of other quantities. The fine-structure constant is related to other physical constants through {{math|''\u03b1'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''k''{{sub|e}}''e''{{sup|2}}|''\u0127c''}}}}, where {{math|''k''{{sub|e}}}} is the [[Coulomb constant]], {{math|''e''}} is the [[elementary charge]], {{math|''\u0127''}} is the [[reduced Planck constant]], and {{math|''c''}} is the [[speed of light]]. Thus, it is impossible to set all of {{math|''k''{{sub|e}}}}, {{math|''e''}}, {{math|''\u0127''}}, and {{math|''c''}} to 1; at most three of this set can be normalized to 1.\n\n==Electromagnetism units==\n{{main|Lorentz\u2013Heaviside units|Gaussian units}}\nIn [[SI units]], electric charge is expressed in coulombs, a separate unit which is additional to the \"mechanical\" units (mass, length, time), even though the traditional definition of the ampere refers to some of these other units.\n\nIn order to build natural units in electromagnetism one can use:\n*'''[[Lorentz\u2013Heaviside units]]''' (classified as a '''rationalized''' system of electromagnetism units).\n*'''[[Gaussian units]]''' (classified as a '''non-rationalized''' system of electromagnetism units).\nOf these, Lorentz\u2013Heaviside is somewhat more common,<ref name=\"GreinerNeise1995\">{{cite book|author1=Walter Greiner|author2=Ludwig Neise|author3=Horst St\u00f6cker|title=Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=12DKsFtFTgYC&pg=PA385|year=1995|publisher=Springer-Verlag|isbn=978-0-387-94299-5|page=385}}</ref> mainly because [[Maxwell's equations]] are simpler in Lorentz\u2013Heaviside units than they are in Gaussian units.\n\nIn the two unit systems, the Planck unit charge {{math|''q''<sub>P</sub>}} is:\n*{{math|''q''<sub>P</sub> {{=}} {{sqrt|4\u03c0''\u03b1\u0127c''}}}} (Lorentz\u2013Heaviside),\n*{{math|''q''<sub>P</sub> {{=}} {{sqrt|''\u03b1\u0127c''}}}} (Gaussian)\nwhere {{math|''\u0127''}} is the [[reduced Planck constant]], {{math|''c''}} is the [[speed of light]], and {{math|''\u03b1'' \u2248 {{sfrac|137.036}}}} is the [[fine-structure constant]].\n\nIn a natural unit system where {{math|1=[[speed of light|''c'']] = 1}}, Lorentz\u2013Heaviside units can be derived from SI units by setting {{math|1=[[electric constant|''\u03b5''<sub>0</sub>]] = [[magnetic constant|''\u03bc''<sub>0</sub>]] = 1}}. Gaussian units can be derived from SI units by a more complicated set of transformations, such as multiplying all [[electric field]]s by {{math|(4\u03c0''\u03b5''<sub>0</sub>)<sup>\u2212{{frac|2}}</sup>}}, multiplying all [[magnetic susceptibility|magnetic susceptibilities]] by {{math|4\u03c0}}, and so on.<ref>See [[Gaussian units#General rules to translate a formula]] and references therein.</ref>\n\n==Systems of natural units==\n\n===Planck units===\n{{Main|Planck units}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"right\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; background-color: #ffffff\"\n!

They only refer to the basic structure of the laws of physics: {{math|''c''}} and {{math|''G''}} are part of the structure of [[spacetime]] in [[general relativity]], and {{math|''\u0127''}} captures the relationship between energy and frequency which is at the foundation of [[quantum mechanics]]. This makes Planck units particularly useful and common in theories of [[quantum gravity]], including [[string theory]].\n\nPlanck units may be considered \"more natural\" even than other natural unit systems discussed below, as Planck units are not based on any arbitrarily chosen prototype object or particle. For example, some other systems use the mass of an electron as a parameter to be normalized.

The Hartree units were first proposed by [[Douglas Hartree]], and are more common than the Rydberg units.\n\nThe units are designed especially to characterize the behavior of an electron in the ground state of a hydrogen atom. For example, using the Hartree convention, in the [[Bohr model]] of the hydrogen atom, an electron in the ground state has orbital velocity = 1, orbital radius = 1, angular momentum = 1, [[ionization energy]] = {{sfrac|2}}, etc.\n\nThe unit of [[energy]] is called the [[Hartree energy]] in the Hartree system and the [[Rydberg energy]] in the Rydberg system. They differ by a factor of 2. The [[speed of light]] is relatively large in atomic units (137 in Hartree or 274 in Rydberg), which comes from the fact that an electron in hydrogen tends to move much slower than the speed of light. The [[gravitational constant]] is extremely small in atomic units (around 10<sup>\u221245</sup>), which comes from the fact that the gravitational force between two electrons is far weaker than the [[Coulomb force]].

Like the other systems, the electromagnetism units can be based on either [[Lorentz\u2013Heaviside units]] or [[Gaussian units]]. The unit of charge is different in each.\n\nFinally, one more unit is needed to construct a usable system of units that includes energy and mass. Most commonly, [[electronvolt]] (eV) is used, despite the fact that this is not a \"natural\" unit in the sense discussed above \u2013 it is defined by a natural property, the [[elementary charge]], and the anthropogenic unit of [[electric potential]], the [[volt]]. (The [[SI prefix]]ed multiples of eV are used as well: keV, MeV, GeV, etc.)\n\nWith the addition of eV (or any other auxiliary unit with the proper dimension), any quantity can be expressed.

Released in 1985, it was the fourth single from his album ''[[Born in the U.S.A.]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/mar10/articles/classictracks_0310.htm|title=Bruce Springsteen \u2018Born In The USA\u2019 &ndash; Classic Tracks|accessdate=March 4, 2012|author=Richard Buskin|publisher=[[Sound on Sound]]|date=March 2010|quote=Recorded with Max Weinberg and Roy Bittan, this moodily atmospheric, synth-based rockabilly track would be added to the album and released as its fourth single.}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\"I'm on Fire\" was first recorded in January 1982 during the first wave of ''Born in the U.S.A.'' sessions, but the album version and the single was cut on May 11, 1982 at [[Power Station (recording studio)|The Power Station]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Heylin |first1=Clinton |title=Song By Song |date=2012 |publisher=Penguin |location=London |url=https://www.penguin.com/ |accessdate=22 August 2019}}</ref> This took place in impromptu fashion when Springsteen started making up a slow tune on guitar for some lyrics he had, some of which had been written for \"Spanish Eyes\", which would later surface on ''[[The Promise (Bruce Springsteen album)|The Promise]]'', and drummer [[Max Weinberg]] and keyboardist [[Roy Bittan]], hearing it for the first time, created an accompaniment on the spot.  The result was a moody number that merges a soft [[rockabilly]] beat, lyrics built around [[sexual tension]], and [[synthesizer]]s into an effective whole; it was one of the first uses of that instrument in Springsteen's music.\n\nThe song peaked at No. 6 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] pop singles charts in early 1985.  It was the fourth of a [[List of Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones#Most top ten singles from one album|record-tying seven Top 10 hit singles]] to be released from ''Born in the U.S.A.'' The single also reached No. 1 in [[Netherlands|the Netherlands]] for 3 weeks in July and August 1985, while two other Springsteen singles (\"[[Dancing in the Dark (Bruce Springsteen song)|Dancing in the Dark]]\" and \"[[Born in the U.S.A. (song)|Born in the U.S.A.]]\") were also in the top ten. This marked the first time for an artist to have as many as three singles inside the Dutch top ten since [[The Beatles]] did so in 1965.<ref>[https://www.hitdossier.nl/top40/1985/week-29 Dutch Top 40, 20 July 1985]</ref>\n\nUnlike the first three singles from the album, no [[remixes]] were made for \"I'm on Fire\" (nor were any made for any of the subsequent singles released).\n\n==Music video==\nThe [[music video]] for the song was shot in March 1985 in [[Los Angeles]], and was directed by filmmaker [[John Sayles]].  Unlike the previous videos from the album, the video was not a performance clip, but rather a dramatic interpretation of the song's themes.\n\nIn it, Springsteen plays a [[working class]] [[automobile mechanic]] with an attractive, married, very well-to-do, mostly unseen female customer who brings her vintage [[Ford Thunderbird]] in for frequent servicing, always requesting that he does the work.  She leaves a small bunch of keys with him when she leaves in her car, possibly including house keys implying that she wishes to start an [[affair]] with him, but declines his offer to bring the car out to her house when it's ready.  Later that night, he drives the car up to her mansion high in the hills above the city.  He looks to a second floor window with the light on and is about to ring the bell, when he thinks better of it and drops her keys in the mailbox next to the door.  He smiles wistfully and walks away down towards the city lights below.<ref>{{cite video | people = Bruce Springsteen  |date = 1986  | title = I'm on Fire   | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpXArn3hII  | medium = Videotape | publisher = [[Sony BMG]] }}</ref>\n\nThe video began airing in mid-April, received extensive [[MTV]] airplay, and later in the year won the [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Male Video]].\n\n==Track listing==\n# \"I'm on Fire\" \u2013 2:36\n# \"Johnny Bye Bye\" (Springsteen, [[Chuck Berry]]) \u2013 1:50\n\nThe B-side of the single, \"Johnny Bye Bye\" - Just before he was sentenced to three years for violating the Mann Act in 1962, [[Chuck Berry]] wrote \"Bye Bye Johnny\", a sequel to \"[[Johnny B. Goode]]\", where a mother sent her musician son off to Hollywood to be a star. \"She drew out all her money from the Southern Trust, and put her little boy aboard the Greyhound Bus\" It wasn't a big hit for Chuck, but Bruce decided to use those lines in 1981, for a new song that used most of the lyrics from Come On Let's Go Tonight, calling it \"Johnny Bye-Bye\". Springsteen had first started performing it in 1981 at the tail end of [[The River Tour]].  It was then recorded in April 1982 during the \"Electric Nebraska\" sessions. The official version was recorded on January 4, 1983 at Thrill Hill West, Los Angeles, CA, and one of the mixes was released on February 6, 1985, as the B-side to \"I'm On Fire\". The song appeared on preliminary song lists for inclusion on what would become ''Born in the U.S.A.'' but was ultimately left off the final album. A 4-track single was released\n\n==Live performance history==\n\"I'm on Fire\" was performed only sporadically at the start of the [[Born in the U.S.A. Tour]], but a couple of months later, it settled into a regular place in the middle of the second set.  It was usually preceded by a long musical introduction, during which Springsteen spoke about not being able to sleep at night when he was young and his parents were struggling and the house was cold.  The song was also given an extended coda of Springsteen's moans against waves of synthesizer.  Such a rendition from an August 19, 1985 performance at [[Giants Stadium]] is included on the ''[[Live/1975-85]]'' box set, but with the spoken part of the introduction edited out.\n\nIn some cases, red lighting from stage floor focused on Springsteen's face was used to further accentuate the song.  On the [[Tunnel of Love Express]], the song was still a regular.  On the [[Human Rights Now! Tour]], Springsteen conducted crowd sing-alongs during the chorus and coda parts.  After some appearances on the [[Bruce Springsteen and the \"Other Band\" Tour|\"Other Band\" Tour]], the song went into a long retirement, not emerging again until occasional performances on 2005's solo [[Devils & Dust Tour]], when he performed it on [[banjo]] with the red lighting back.\n\nBetween 1999 and 2008, the song was only performed on eight occasions with the E Street Band: once on the Reunion Tour (June 17, 1999, Bremen), once on The Rising Tour (April 18, 2003, Ottawa) and six times on the Magic Tour. The song has made surprise return on a semi-regular basis during the European leg of the 2009 Working on a Dream tour. As of November 2009, it has been performed live 245 times.\n\n==Live cover performances==\n* [[Big Country]] included a recorded live cover of the song on their 1996 album ''[[Eclectic (Big Country album)|Eclectic]]''.\n* [[Tori Amos]] covered the song in concert and on the television program and CD release ''[[VH1]] Crossroads'' in 1996.\n* [[Heather Nova]] is known to perform a [[Folk music|folk]] style cover of the song at her live shows, often at the end of the set.

Clockwise from top left, they are solid, liquid, plasma, and gas, represented by an [[ice sculpture]], a [[Drop (liquid)|drop]] of water, [[electrical arc]]ing from a [[tesla coil]], and the air around clouds, respectively.]]\nIn [[physics]], a '''state of matter''' is one of the distinct forms in which [[matter]] can exist. Four states of matter are observable in everyday life: [[solid]], [[liquid]], [[gas]], and [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]. Many intermediate states are known to exist, such as [[liquid crystal]], and some states only exist under extreme conditions, such as [[Bose\u2013Einstein condensate]]s, [[neutron-degenerate matter]], and [[quark\u2013gluon plasma]], which only occur, respectively, in situations of extreme cold, extreme density, and extremely high energy. For a complete list of all exotic states of matter, see the [[list of states of matter]].\n\nHistorically, the distinction is made based on qualitative differences in properties. Matter in the solid state maintains a fixed volume and shape, with component particles ([[atoms]], [[molecules]] or [[ions]]) close together and fixed into place. Matter in the liquid state maintains a fixed volume, but has a variable shape that adapts to fit its container. Its particles are still close together but move freely. Matter in the gaseous state has both variable volume and shape, adapting both to fit its container. Its particles are neither close together nor fixed in place. Matter in the plasma state has variable volume and shape, and contains neutral atoms as well as a significant number of ions and electrons, both of which can move around freely.\n\nThe term [[Phase (matter)|phase]] is sometimes used as a synonym for state of matter, but a system can contain several [[Miscibility|immiscible]] phases of the same state of matter.\n\n== The four fundamental states ==\n\n===Solid===\n\n[[File:Stohrem.jpg|thumb|right|A crystalline solid: atomic resolution image of [[strontium titanate]]. Brighter atoms are [[strontium]] and darker ones are [[titanium]].]]\n\n{{Main|Solid}}\n\nIn a solid, constituent particles (ions, atoms, or molecules) are closely packed together. The [[Bonding in solids|forces between particles]] are so strong that the particles cannot move freely but can only vibrate. As a result, a solid has a stable, definite shape, and a definite volume. Solids can only change their shape by an outside force, as when broken or cut.\n\nIn [[crystal|crystalline solids]], the particles (atoms, molecules, or ions) are packed in a regularly ordered, repeating pattern. There are various different [[crystal structure]]s, and the same substance can have more than one structure (or solid phase). For example, [[iron]] has a [[cubic crystal system|body-centred cubic]] structure at temperatures below {{convert|912|C|F}}, and a [[cubic crystal system|face-centred cubic]] structure between 912 and {{convert|1394|C|F}}. [[Ice]] has fifteen known crystal structures, or fifteen solid phases, which exist at various temperatures and pressures.<ref>\n{{Cite book\n |author=M.A. Wahab\n |date=2005\n |title=Solid State Physics: Structure and Properties of Materials\n |publisher=Alpha Science\n |pages=1\u20133\n |isbn=978-1-84265-218-3\n}}</ref>\n\n[[Glass]]es and other non-crystalline, [[amorphous solid]]s without [[order and disorder (physics)|long-range order]] are not [[thermal equilibrium]] ground states; therefore they are described below as nonclassical states of matter.\n\nSolids can be transformed into liquids by melting, and liquids can be transformed into solids by freezing. Solids can also change directly into gases through the process of [[sublimation (chemistry)|sublimation]], and gases can likewise change directly into solids through [[deposition (phase transition)|deposition]].\n\n===Liquid===\n[[Image:Teilchenmodell Fl\u00fcssigkeit.svg|thumb|Structure of a classical monatomic liquid. Atoms have many nearest neighbors in contact, yet no long-range order is present.]]\n{{Main|Liquid}}\nA liquid is a nearly incompressible [[fluid]] that conforms to the shape of its container but retains a (nearly) constant volume independent of pressure. The volume is definite if the [[temperature]] and [[pressure]] are constant. When a solid is heated above its [[melting point]], it becomes liquid, given that the pressure is higher than the [[triple point]] of the substance. Intermolecular (or interatomic or interionic) forces are still important, but the molecules have enough energy to move relative to each other and the structure is mobile. This means that the shape of a liquid is not definite but is determined by its container. The volume is usually greater than that of the corresponding solid, the best known exception being [[water]], H{{sub|2}}O. The highest temperature at which a given liquid can exist is its [[critical temperature]].<ref name=White>\n{{Cite book\n |author=F. White\n |date=2003\n |title=Fluid Mechanics\n |page=4\n |publisher=McGraw-Hill\n |isbn=978-0-07-240217-9\n}}</ref>\n\n===Gas===\n\n[[File:Gas molecules.gif|thumb|right|The spaces between gas molecules are very big. Gas molecules have very weak or no bonds at all. The molecules in \"gas\" can move freely and fast.]]\n\n{{Main|Gas}}\nA gas is a compressible fluid. Not only will a gas conform to the shape of its container but it will also expand to fill the container.\n\nIn a gas, the molecules have enough [[kinetic energy]] so that the effect of intermolecular forces is small (or zero for an [[ideal gas]]), and the typical distance between neighboring molecules is much greater than the molecular size. A gas has no definite shape or volume, but occupies the entire container in which it is confined. A liquid may be converted to a gas by heating at constant pressure to the [[boiling point]], or else by reducing the pressure at constant temperature.\n\nAt temperatures below its [[critical temperature]], a gas is also called a [[vapor]], and can be liquefied by compression alone without cooling. A vapor can exist in equilibrium with a liquid (or solid), in which case the gas pressure equals the [[vapor pressure]] of the liquid (or solid).\n\nA [[supercritical fluid]] (SCF) is a gas whose temperature and pressure are above the critical temperature and [[critical temperature|critical pressure]] respectively. In this state, the distinction between liquid and gas disappears. A supercritical fluid has the physical properties of a gas, but its high density confers solvent properties in some cases, which leads to useful applications. For example, [[supercritical carbon dioxide]] is used to [[supercritical fluid extraction|extract]] [[caffeine]] in the manufacture of [[decaffeination|decaffeinated]] coffee.<ref name=Turrell>\n{{Cite book\n |author=G.

This gives it the ability to conduct electricity.]]\n\n{{Main|Plasma (physics)}}\nLike a gas, plasma does not have definite shape or volume. Unlike gases, plasmas are electrically conductive, produce magnetic fields and electric currents, and respond strongly to electromagnetic forces. Positively charged nuclei swim in a \"sea\" of freely-moving disassociated electrons, similar to the way such charges exist in conductive metal, where this electron \"sea\"  allows matter in the plasma state to conduct electricity.\n\nA gas is usually converted to a plasma in one of two ways, e.g., either from a huge voltage difference between two points, or by exposing it to extremely high temperatures. Heating matter to high temperatures causes electrons to leave the atoms, resulting in the presence of free electrons. This creates a so-called partially ionised plasma. At very high temperatures, such as those present in stars, it is assumed that essentially all electrons are \"free\", and that a very high-energy plasma is essentially bare nuclei swimming in a sea of electrons. This forms the so-called fully ionised plasma.\n\nThe plasma state is often misunderstood, and although not freely existing under normal conditions on Earth, it is quite commonly generated by either [[lightning]], [[electric spark]]s, [[Fluorescent lamp|fluorescent lights]], [[Neon sign|neon lights]] or in [[Plasma display|plasma televisions]]. The [[solar corona|Sun's corona]], some types of [[flame]], and stars are all examples of illuminated matter in the plasma state.\n\n==Phase transitions==\n\n{{Main|Phase transitions}}\n\n{{wide image|Physics matter state transition 1 en.svg|800px|This diagram illustrates transitions between the four fundamental states of matter.}}\n\nA state of matter is also characterized by [[phase transitions]]. A phase transition indicates a change in structure and can be recognized by an abrupt change in properties. A distinct state of matter can be defined as any set of [[thermodynamic state|states]] distinguished from any other set of states by a [[phase transition]]. Water can be said to have several distinct solid states.<ref>\n{{Cite web\n |author      = M.

Likewise, [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] states are demarcated by phase transitions and have distinctive properties.\nWhen the change of state occurs in stages the intermediate steps are called [[mesophase]]s. Such phases have been exploited by the introduction of [[liquid crystal]] technology.<ref>\n{{Cite book\n |author=D.L.

Near [[absolute zero]], a substance exists as a [[solid]]. As heat is added to this substance it melts into a liquid at its [[melting point]], boils into a gas at its [[boiling point]], and if heated high enough would enter a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] state in which the [[electrons]] are so energized that they leave their parent atoms.\n\nForms of matter that are not composed of molecules and are organized by different forces can also be considered different states of matter. [[Superfluids]] (like [[Fermionic condensate]]) and the [[quark\u2013gluon plasma]] are examples.\n\nIn a chemical equation, the state of matter of the chemicals may be shown as (s) for solid, (l) for liquid, and (g) for gas. An [[aqueous solution]] is denoted (aq). Matter in the plasma state is seldom used (if at all) in chemical equations, so there is no standard symbol to denote it. In the rare equations that plasma is used in plasma is symbolized as (p).\n\n==Non-classical states==\n\n=== Glass ===\n{{Main|Glass}}\n\n{{multiple image\n | image1    = Silica.svg\n | alt1      = Atoms of Si and O; each atom has the same number of bonds, but the overall arrangement of the atoms is random.\n | width1    = 200\n | image2    = SiO\u00b2 Quartz.svg\n | alt2      = Regular hexagonal pattern of Si and O atoms, with a Si atom at each corner and the O atoms at the centre of each side.\n | width2    = 200\n | footer    = Schematic representation of a random-network glassy form (left) and ordered crystalline lattice (right) of identical chemical composition.\n}}\n\n[[Glass]] is a non-crystalline or [[amorphous solid]] material that exhibits a [[glass transition]] when heated towards the liquid state. Glasses can be made of quite different classes of materials: inorganic networks (such as window glass, made of [[silicate]] plus additives), metallic alloys, ionic melts, aqueous solutions, molecular liquids, and polymers.\nThermodynamically, a glass is in a [[metastable state]] with respect to its crystalline counterpart. The conversion rate, however, is practically zero.\n\n=== Crystals with some degree of disorder ===\n\nA [[plastic crystal]] is a molecular solid with long-range positional order but with constituent molecules retaining rotational freedom; in an [[orientational glass]] this degree of freedom is frozen in a [[order and disorder (physics)|quenched disordered]] state.\n\nSimilarly, in a [[spin glass]] magnetic disorder is frozen.\n\n===Liquid crystal states===\n{{Main|Liquid crystal}}\n\nLiquid crystal states have properties intermediate between mobile liquids and ordered solids. Generally, they are able to flow like a liquid, but exhibiting long-range order. For example, the [[Liquid crystal#Nematic phase|nematic phase]] consists of long rod-like molecules such as [[para-azoxyanisole]], which is nematic in the temperature range {{convert|118\u2013136|C|F}}.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Phase Transitions of Liquid Crystal PAA in Confined Geometries|author=Shao, Y.|author2=Zerda, T.W.|journal=Journal of Physical Chemistry B|date=1998|volume=102|issue=18|pages=3387\u20133394|doi=10.1021/jp9734437}}</ref> In this state the molecules flow as in a liquid, but they all point in the same direction (within each domain) and cannot rotate freely. Like a crystalline solid, but unlike a liquid, liquid crystals react to polarized light.\n\nOther types of liquid crystals are described in the main article on these states. Several types have technological importance, for example, in [[liquid crystal display]]s.\n\n===Magnetically ordered===\n[[Transition metal]] atoms often have [[magnetic moment]]s due to the net [[spin (physics)|spin]] of electrons that remain unpaired and do not form chemical bonds. In some solids the magnetic moments on different atoms are ordered and can form a ferromagnet, an antiferromagnet or a ferrimagnet.\n\nIn a [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnet]]\u2014for instance, solid [[iron]]\u2014the magnetic moment on each atom is aligned in the same direction (within a [[magnetic domain]]). If the domains are also aligned, the solid is a permanent [[magnet]], which is magnetic even in the absence of an external [[magnetic field]]. The [[magnetization]] disappears when the magnet is heated to the [[Curie point]], which for iron is {{convert|768|C|F}}.\n\nAn [[antiferromagnetism|antiferromagnet]] has two networks of equal and opposite magnetic moments, which cancel each other out so that the net magnetization is zero. For example, in [[nickel(II) oxide]] (NiO), half the nickel atoms have moments aligned in one direction and half in the opposite direction.\n\nIn a [[ferrimagnetism|ferrimagnet]], the two networks of magnetic moments are opposite but unequal, so that cancellation is incomplete and there is a non-zero net magnetization. An example is [[magnetite]] (Fe{{sub|3}}O{{sub|4}}), which contains Fe{{sup|2+}} and Fe{{sup|3+}} ions with different magnetic moments.\n\nA [[quantum spin liquid]] (QSL) is a disordered state in a system of interacting quantum spins which preserves its disorder to very low temperatures, unlike other disordered states. It is not a liquid in physical sense, but a solid whose magnetic order is inherently disordered. The name \"liquid\" is due to an analogy with the molecular disorder in a conventional liquid. A QSL is neither a [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnet]], where magnetic domains are parallel, nor an [[Antiferromagnetism|antiferromagnet]], where the magnetic domains are antiparallel; instead, the magnetic domains are randomly oriented. This can be realized e.g. by [[Geometrical frustration|geometrically frustrated]] magnetic moments that cannot point uniformly parallel or antiparallel. When cooling down and settling to a state, the domain must \"choose\" an orientation, but if the possible states are similar in energy, one will be chosen randomly. Consequently, despite strong short-range order, there is no long-range magnetic order.\n\n===Microphase-separated===\n{{Main|Copolymer}}\n\n[[File:Sbs block copolymer.jpg|thumb|right|SBS block copolymer in [[Transmission electron microscopy|TEM]]]] [[Copolymers]] can undergo microphase separation to form a diverse array of periodic nanostructures, as shown in the example of the [[Kraton (polymer)|styrene-butadiene-styrene block copolymer]] shown at right. Microphase separation can be understood by analogy to the phase separation between [[oil]] and water. Due to chemical incompatibility between the blocks, block copolymers undergo a similar phase separation. However, because the blocks are [[covalent bond|covalently bonded]] to each other, they cannot demix macroscopically as water and oil can, and so instead the blocks form [[nanometer]]-sized structures. Depending on the relative lengths of each block and the overall block topology of the polymer, many morphologies can be obtained, each its own phase of matter.\n\n[[Ionic liquid]]s also display microphase separation. The anion and cation are not necessarily compatible and would demix otherwise, but electric charge attraction prevents them from separating. Their anions and cations appear to diffuse within compartmentalized layers or micelles instead of freely as in a uniform liquid.<ref>\u00c1lvarez, V.H.; Dosil, N.; Gonzalez-Cabaleiro, R.; Mattedi, S.; Martin-Pastor, M.; Iglesias, M. & Navaza, J.M.: Br\u00f8nsted Ionic Liquids for Sustainable Processes: Synthesis and Physical Properties.

This was discovered in 1937 for [[helium]], which forms a superfluid below the [[lambda point|lambda temperature]] of {{convert|2.17|K|C}} (with {{Convert|\u2212270.98|C|F}}). In this state it will attempt to \"climb\" out of its container.<ref>\n{{Cite web\n |author      = J.R.

In a BEC, matter stops behaving as independent particles, and collapses into a single quantum state that can be described with a single, uniform wavefunction.\n\nIn the gas phase, the Bose\u2013Einstein condensate remained an unverified theoretical prediction for many years. In 1995, the research groups of [[Eric Cornell]] and [[Carl Wieman]], of [[JILA]] at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]], produced the first such condensate experimentally. A Bose\u2013Einstein condensate is \"colder\" than a solid. It may occur when atoms have very similar (or the same) [[Energy level|quantum levels]], at temperatures very close to [[absolute zero]], {{convert|\u2212273.15|C|F}}.\n\n===Fermionic condensate===\n{{main|Fermionic condensate}}\nA ''fermionic condensate'' is similar to the Bose\u2013Einstein condensate but composed of [[fermion]]s. The [[Pauli exclusion principle]] prevents fermions from entering the same quantum state, but a pair of fermions can behave as a boson, and multiple such pairs can then enter the same quantum state without restriction.\n\n===Rydberg molecule===\nOne of the [[metastable state]]s of strongly non-ideal plasma is [[Rydberg matter]], which forms upon condensation of [[excited state|excited atoms]]. These atoms can also turn into [[ion]]s and [[electron]]s if they reach a certain temperature.

A ''[[Quantum spin Hall effect|quantum spin Hall state]]'' is a theoretical phase that may pave the way for the development of electronic devices that dissipate less energy and generate less heat. This is a derivation of the Quantum Hall state of matter.\n\n===Photonic matter===\n{{main|Photonic matter}}\nPhotonic matter is a phenomenon where [[photon]]s interacting with a gas develop apparent mass, and can interact with each other, even forming photonic \"molecules\". The source of mass is the gas, which is massive. This is in contrast to photons moving in empty space, which have no [[rest mass]], and cannot interact.\n\n===Dropleton===\n{{main|Dropleton}}\nA \"quantum fog\" of electrons and holes that flow around each other and even ripple like a liquid, rather than existing as discrete pairs.<ref name=\"Luntz\">{{cite web|last1=Luntz|first1=Stephen|title=New State of Matter Discovered|url=http://www.iflscience.com/physics/new-state-matter-discovered/#3Oe9x65kkHViXABt.99|website=IFLScience|accessdate=16 April 2017|language=en|date=3 January 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170416224429/http://www.iflscience.com/physics/new-state-matter-discovered/#3Oe9x65kkHViXABt.99|archivedate=16 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n==High-energy states==\n\n===Degenerate matter===\n{{Main|Degenerate matter}}\nUnder extremely high pressure, as in the cores of dead stars, ordinary matter undergoes a transition to a series of exotic states of matter collectively known as [[degenerate matter]], which are supported mainly by quantum mechanical effects. In physics, \"degenerate\" refers to two states that have the same energy and are thus interchangeable. Degenerate matter is supported by the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], which prevents two [[fermion]]ic particles from occupying the same quantum state. Unlike regular plasma, degenerate plasma expands little when heated, because there are simply no momentum states left. Consequently, degenerate stars collapse into very high densities. More massive degenerate stars are smaller, because the gravitational force increases, but pressure does not increase proportionally.\n\n[[Degenerate matter|Electron-degenerate matter]] is found inside [[white dwarf]] stars. Electrons remain bound to atoms but are able to transfer to adjacent atoms. [[Degenerate matter|Neutron-degenerate matter]] is found in [[neutron star]]s. Vast gravitational pressure compresses atoms so strongly that the electrons are forced to combine with protons via inverse beta-decay, resulting in a superdense conglomeration of neutrons. Normally [[Neutron|free neutrons]] outside an atomic nucleus will [[Radioactive decay|decay]] with a half life of just under 15 minutes, but in a neutron star, the decay is overtaken by inverse decay. Cold degenerate matter is also present in planets such as [[Jupiter]] and in the even more massive [[brown dwarf]]s, which are expected to have a core with [[metallic hydrogen]]. Because of the degeneracy, more massive brown dwarfs are not significantly larger. In metals, the electrons can be modeled as a degenerate gas moving in a lattice of non-degenerate positive ions.\n\n===Quark matter===\n{{Main|QCD matter}}\nIn regular cold matter, [[quark]]s, fundamental particles of nuclear matter, are confined by the [[strong force]] into [[hadron]]s that consist of 2\u20134 quarks, such as protons and neutrons. Quark matter or quantum chromodynanamical (QCD) matter is a group of phases where the strong force is overcome and quarks are deconfined and free to move. Quark matter phases occur at extremely high densities or temperatures, and there are no known ways to produce them in equilibrium in the laboratory; in ordinary conditions, any quark matter formed immediately undergoes radioactive decay.\n\n[[Strange matter]] is a type of [[quark matter]] that is suspected to exist inside some neutron stars close to the [[Tolman\u2013Oppenheimer\u2013Volkoff limit]] (approximately 2\u20133 [[solar mass]]es), although there is no direct evidence of its existence. In strange matter, part of the energy available manifests as [[strange quark]]s, a heavier analogue of the common [[down quark]]. It may be stable at lower energy states once formed, although this is not known.\n\n[[Quark\u2013gluon plasma]] is a very high-temperature phase in which [[quark]]s become free and able to move independently, rather than being perpetually bound into particles, in a sea of [[gluon]]s, subatomic particles that transmit the [[strong interaction|strong force]] that binds quarks together. This is analogous to the liberation of electrons from atoms in a plasma. This state is briefly attainable in extremely high-energy heavy ion collisions in [[particle accelerator]]s, and allows scientists to observe the properties of individual quarks, and not just theorize. Quark\u2013gluon plasma was discovered at [[CERN]] in 2000. Unlike plasma, which flows like a gas, interactions within QGP are strong and it flows like a liquid.\n\nAt high densities but relatively low temperatures, quarks are theorized to form a quark liquid whose nature is presently unknown. It forms a distinct [[Color\u2013flavor locking|color-flavor locked]] (CFL) phase at even higher densities. This phase is [[superconductive]] for color charge. These phases may occur in [[neutron star]]s but they are presently theoretical.\n\n===Color-glass condensate===\n{{Main|Color-glass condensate}}\nColor-glass condensate is a type of matter theorized to exist in atomic nuclei traveling near the speed of light. According to Einstein's theory of relativity, a high-energy nucleus appears length contracted, or compressed, along its direction of motion. As a result, the gluons inside the nucleus appear to a stationary observer as a \"gluonic wall\" traveling near the speed of light. At very high energies, the density of the gluons in this wall is seen to increase greatly. Unlike the quark\u2013gluon plasma produced in the collision of such walls, the color-glass condensate describes the walls themselves, and is an intrinsic property of the particles that can only be observed under high-energy conditions such as those at RHIC and possibly at the Large Hadron Collider as well.\n\n==Very high energy states==\nVarious theories predict new states of matter at very high energies. An unknown state has created the [[baryon asymmetry]] in the universe, but little is known about it. In [[string theory]], a [[Hagedorn temperature]] is predicted for superstrings at about 10<sup>30</sup> K, where superstrings are copiously produced. At [[Planck temperature]] (10<sup>32</sup> K), gravity becomes a significant force between individual particles. No current theory can describe these states and they cannot be produced with any foreseeable experiment. However, these states are important in [[cosmology]] because the universe may have passed through these states in the [[Big Bang]].\n\nThe '''[[gravitational singularity]]''' predicted by [[general relativity]] to exist at the center of a [[black hole]] is ''not'' a phase of matter; it is not a material object at all (although the mass-energy of matter contributed to its creation) but rather a property of [[spacetime]] at a location. It could be argued, of course, that all particles are properties of spacetime at a location,<ref>{{cite book|author1=David Chalmers|author2=David Manley|author3=Ryan Wasserman|title=Metametaphysics: New Essays on the Foundations of Ontology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6nqzIi16CY0C&pg=PA378|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-954604-6|pages=378\u2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140917070144/http://books.google.com/books?id=6nqzIi16CY0C&pg=PA378|archivedate=17 September 2014}}</ref> leaving a half-note of controversy on the subject.\n\n==Other proposed states==\n\n===Supersolid===\n{{Main|Supersolid}}\nA supersolid is a spatially ordered material (that is, a solid or crystal) with superfluid properties.

When in a normal solid state, the atoms of matter align themselves in a grid pattern, so that the spin of any electron is the opposite of the spin of all electrons touching it. But in a string-net liquid, atoms are arranged in some pattern that requires some electrons to have neighbors with the same spin. This gives rise to curious properties, as well as supporting some unusual proposals about the fundamental conditions of the universe itself.\n\n===Superglass===\n{{Main|Superglass}}\nA superglass is a phase of matter characterized, at the same time, by [[superfluid]]ity and a frozen amorphous structure.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Hidden states of matter]]\n* [[Classical element]]\n* [[Condensed matter physics]]\n* [[Cooling curve]]\n* [[Phase (matter)]]\n* [[Supercooling]]\n* [[Superheating]]\n{{Table_of_phase_transitions}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|States of aggregation}}\n* [http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2005/matter.html 2005-06-22, MIT News: MIT physicists create new form of matter] Citat: \"...&nbsp;They have become the first to create a new type of matter, a gas of atoms that shows high-temperature superfluidity.\"\n* [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/10/031010075634.htm 2003-10-10, Science Daily: Metallic Phase For Bosons Implies New State Of Matter]\n* [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2004/01/040115074553.htm 2004-01-15, ScienceDaily: Probable Discovery Of A New, Supersolid, Phase Of Matter] Citat: \"...We apparently have observed, for the first time, a solid material with the characteristics of a superfluid...but because all its particles are in the identical quantum state, it remains a solid even though its component particles are continually flowing...\"\n* [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2004/01/040129073547.htm 2004-01-29, ScienceDaily: NIST/University Of Colorado Scientists Create New Form Of Matter: A Fermionic Condensate]\n* [http://vega.org.uk/video/subseries/30 Short videos demonstrating of States of Matter, solids, liquids and gases by Prof. J M Murrell, University of Sussex]\n\n{{State of matter|state=expanded}}\n{{Condensed matter physics topics}}\n{{Authority control}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2019}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:State Of Matter}}\n[[Category:Condensed matter physics]]\n[[Category:Engineering thermodynamics]]\n[[Category:Phases of matter| ]]\n[[Category:Physics-related lists|States of matter]]\n", "text_old": "{{Distinguish|Phase (matter)}}\n{{pp|small=yes}}\n{{short description|Distinct forms that different phases of matter take on}}\n[[File:Four Fundamental States of Matter.png|thumb|right|370px|The four common states of matter. Clockwise from top left, they are solid, liquid, plasma, and gas, represented by an [[ice sculpture]], a [[Drop (liquid)|drop]] of water, [[electrical arc]]ing from a [[tesla coil]], and the air around clouds, respectively.]]\nIn [[physics]], a '''state of matter''' is one of the distinct forms in which [[matter]] can exist. Four states of matter are observable in everyday life: [[solid]], [[liquid]], [[gas]], and [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]. Many intermediate states are known to exist, such as [[liquid crystal]], and some states only exist under extreme conditions, such as [[Bose\u2013Einstein condensate]]s, [[neutron-degenerate matter]], and [[quark\u2013gluon plasma]], which only occur, respectively, in situations of extreme cold, extreme density, and extremely high energy. For a complete list of all exotic states of matter, see the [[list of states of matter]].\n\nHistorically, the distinction is made based on qualitative differences in properties. Matter in the solid state maintains a fixed volume and shape, with component particles ([[atoms]], [[molecules]] or [[ions]]) close together and fixed into place. Matter in the liquid state maintains a fixed volume, but has a variable shape that adapts to fit its container. Its particles are still close together but move freely. Matter in the gaseous state has both variable volume and shape, adapting both to fit its container. Its particles are neither close together nor fixed in place. Matter in the plasma state has variable volume and shape, and contains neutral atoms as well as a significant number of ions and electrons, both of which can move around freely.\n\nThe term [[Phase (matter)|phase]] is sometimes used as a synonym for state of matter, but a system can contain several [[Miscibility|immiscible]] phases of the same state of matter.\n\n== The four fundamental states ==\n\n===Solid===\n\n[[File:Stohrem.jpg|thumb|right|A crystalline solid: atomic resolution image of [[strontium titanate]]. Brighter atoms are [[strontium]] and darker ones are [[titanium]].]]\n\n{{Main|Solid}}\n\nIn a solid, constituent particles (ions, atoms, or molecules) are closely packed together. The [[Bonding in solids|forces between particles]] are so strong that the particles cannot move freely but can only vibrate. As a result, a solid has a stable, definite shape, and a definite volume. Solids can only change their shape by an outside force, as when broken or cut.\n\nIn [[crystal|crystalline solids]], the particles (atoms, molecules, or ions) are packed in a regularly ordered, repeating pattern. There are various different [[crystal structure]]s, and the same substance can have more than one structure (or solid phase). For example, [[iron]] has a [[cubic crystal system|body-centred cubic]] structure at temperatures below {{convert|912|C|F}}, and a [[cubic crystal system|face-centred cubic]] structure between 912 and {{convert|1394|C|F}}. [[Ice]] has fifteen known crystal structures, or fifteen solid phases, which exist at various temperatures and pressures.<ref>\n{{Cite book\n |author=M.A. Wahab\n |date=2005\n |title=Solid State Physics: Structure and Properties of Materials\n |publisher=Alpha Science\n |pages=1\u20133\n |isbn=978-1-84265-218-3\n}}</ref>\n\n[[Glass]]es and other non-crystalline, [[amorphous solid]]s without [[order and disorder (physics)|long-range order]] are not [[thermal equilibrium]] ground states; therefore they are described below as nonclassical states of matter.\n\nSolids can be transformed into liquids by melting, and liquids can be transformed into solids by freezing. Solids can also change directly into gases through the process of [[sublimation (chemistry)|sublimation]], and gases can likewise change directly into solids through [[deposition (phase transition)|deposition]].\n\n===Liquid===\n[[Image:Teilchenmodell Fl\u00fcssigkeit.svg|thumb|Structure of a classical monatomic liquid. Atoms have many nearest neighbors in contact, yet no long-range order is present.]]\n{{Main|Liquid}}\nA liquid is a nearly incompressible [[fluid]] that conforms to the shape of its container but retains a (nearly) constant volume independent of pressure. The volume is definite if the [[temperature]] and [[pressure]] are constant. When a solid is heated above its [[melting point]], it becomes liquid, given that the pressure is higher than the [[triple point]] of the substance. Intermolecular (or interatomic or interionic) forces are still important, but the molecules have enough energy to move relative to each other and the structure is mobile. This means that the shape of a liquid is not definite but is determined by its container. The volume is usually greater than that of the corresponding solid, the best known exception being [[water]], H{{sub|2}}O. The highest temperature at which a given liquid can exist is its [[critical temperature]].<ref name=White>\n{{Cite book\n |author=F.

Gas molecules have very weak or no bonds at all. The molecules in \"gas\" can move freely and fast.]]\n\n{{Main|Gas}}\nA gas is a compressible fluid. Not only will a gas conform to the shape of its container but it will also expand to fill the container.\n\nIn a gas, the molecules have enough [[kinetic energy]] so that the effect of intermolecular forces is small (or zero for an [[ideal gas]]), and the typical distance between neighboring molecules is much greater than the molecular size. A gas has no definite shape or volume, but occupies the entire container in which it is confined. A liquid may be converted to a gas by heating at constant pressure to the [[boiling point]], or else by reducing the pressure at constant temperature.\n\nAt temperatures below its [[critical temperature]], a gas is also called a [[vapor]], and can be liquefied by compression alone without cooling. A vapor can exist in equilibrium with a liquid (or solid), in which case the gas pressure equals the [[vapor pressure]] of the liquid (or solid).\n\nA [[supercritical fluid]] (SCF) is a gas whose temperature and pressure are above the critical temperature and [[critical temperature|critical pressure]] respectively. In this state, the distinction between liquid and gas disappears. A supercritical fluid has the physical properties of a gas, but its high density confers solvent properties in some cases, which leads to useful applications. For example, [[supercritical carbon dioxide]] is used to [[supercritical fluid extraction|extract]] [[caffeine]] in the manufacture of [[decaffeination|decaffeinated]] coffee.<ref name=Turrell>\n{{Cite book\n |author=G.

This gives it the ability to conduct electricity.]]\n\n{{Main|Plasma (physics)}}\nLike a gas, plasma does not have definite shape or volume. Unlike gases, plasmas are electrically conductive, produce magnetic fields and electric currents, and respond strongly to electromagnetic forces. Positively charged nuclei swim in a \"sea\" of freely-moving disassociated electrons, similar to the way such charges exist in conductive metal, where this electron \"sea\"  allows matter in the plasma state to conduct electricity.\n\nA gas is usually converted to a plasma in one of two ways, e.g., either from a huge voltage difference between two points, or by exposing it to extremely high temperatures. Heating matter to high temperatures causes electrons to leave the atoms, resulting in the presence of free electrons. This creates a so-called partially ionised plasma. At very high temperatures, such as those present in stars, it is assumed that essentially all electrons are \"free\", and that a very high-energy plasma is essentially bare nuclei swimming in a sea of electrons. This forms the so-called fully ionised plasma.\n\nThe plasma state is often misunderstood, and although not freely existing under normal conditions on Earth, it is quite commonly generated by either [[lightning]], [[electric spark]]s, [[Fluorescent lamp|fluorescent lights]], [[Neon sign|neon lights]] or in [[Plasma display|plasma televisions]]. The Sun's [[corona]], some types of [[flame]], and stars are all examples of illuminated matter in the plasma state.\n\n==Phase transitions==\n\n{{Main|Phase transitions}}\n\n{{wide image|Physics matter state transition 1 en.svg|800px|This diagram illustrates transitions between the four fundamental states of matter.}}\n\nA state of matter is also characterized by [[phase transitions]]. A phase transition indicates a change in structure and can be recognized by an abrupt change in properties. A distinct state of matter can be defined as any set of [[thermodynamic state|states]] distinguished from any other set of states by a [[phase transition]]. Water can be said to have several distinct solid states.<ref>\n{{Cite web\n |author      = M.

Such phases have been exploited by the introduction of [[liquid crystal]] technology.<ref>\n{{Cite book\n |author=D.L.

Near [[absolute zero]], a substance exists as a [[solid]]. As heat is added to this substance it melts into a liquid at its [[melting point]], boils into a gas at its [[boiling point]], and if heated high enough would enter a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] state in which the [[electrons]] are so energized that they leave their parent atoms.\n\nForms of matter that are not composed of molecules and are organized by different forces can also be considered different states of matter. [[Superfluids]] (like [[Fermionic condensate]]) and the [[quark\u2013gluon plasma]] are examples.\n\nIn a chemical equation, the state of matter of the chemicals may be shown as (s) for solid, (l) for liquid, and (g) for gas. An [[aqueous solution]] is denoted (aq). Matter in the plasma state is seldom used (if at all) in chemical equations, so there is no standard symbol to denote it. In the rare equations that plasma is used in plasma is symbolized as (p).\n\n==Non-classical states==\n\n=== Glass ===\n{{Main|Glass}}\n\n{{multiple image\n | image1    = Silica.svg\n | alt1      = Atoms of Si and O; each atom has the same number of bonds, but the overall arrangement of the atoms is random.\n | width1    = 200\n | image2    = SiO\u00b2 Quartz.svg\n | alt2      = Regular hexagonal pattern of Si and O atoms, with a Si atom at each corner and the O atoms at the centre of each side.\n | width2    = 200\n | footer    = Schematic representation of a random-network glassy form (left) and ordered crystalline lattice (right) of identical chemical composition.\n}}\n\n[[Glass]] is a non-crystalline or [[amorphous solid]] material that exhibits a [[glass transition]] when heated towards the liquid state. Glasses can be made of quite different classes of materials: inorganic networks (such as window glass, made of [[silicate]] plus additives), metallic alloys, ionic melts, aqueous solutions, molecular liquids, and polymers.\nThermodynamically, a glass is in a [[metastable state]] with respect to its crystalline counterpart. The conversion rate, however, is practically zero.\n\n=== Crystals with some degree of disorder ===\n\nA [[plastic crystal]] is a molecular solid with long-range positional order but with constituent molecules retaining rotational freedom; in an [[orientational glass]] this degree of freedom is frozen in a [[order and disorder (physics)|quenched disordered]] state.\n\nSimilarly, in a [[spin glass]] magnetic disorder is frozen.\n\n===Liquid crystal states===\n{{Main|Liquid crystal}}\n\nLiquid crystal states have properties intermediate between mobile liquids and ordered solids. Generally, they are able to flow like a liquid, but exhibiting long-range order. For example, the [[Liquid crystal#Nematic phase|nematic phase]] consists of long rod-like molecules such as [[para-azoxyanisole]], which is nematic in the temperature range {{convert|118\u2013136|C|F}}.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Phase Transitions of Liquid Crystal PAA in Confined Geometries|author=Shao, Y.|author2=Zerda, T.W.|journal=Journal of Physical Chemistry B|date=1998|volume=102|issue=18|pages=3387\u20133394|doi=10.1021/jp9734437}}</ref> In this state the molecules flow as in a liquid, but they all point in the same direction (within each domain) and cannot rotate freely. Like a crystalline solid, but unlike a liquid, liquid crystals react to polarized light.\n\nOther types of liquid crystals are described in the main article on these states. Several types have technological importance, for example, in [[liquid crystal display]]s.\n\n===Magnetically ordered===\n[[Transition metal]] atoms often have [[magnetic moment]]s due to the net [[spin (physics)|spin]] of electrons that remain unpaired and do not form chemical bonds. In some solids the magnetic moments on different atoms are ordered and can form a ferromagnet, an antiferromagnet or a ferrimagnet.\n\nIn a [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnet]]\u2014for instance, solid [[iron]]\u2014the magnetic moment on each atom is aligned in the same direction (within a [[magnetic domain]]). If the domains are also aligned, the solid is a permanent [[magnet]], which is magnetic even in the absence of an external [[magnetic field]]. The [[magnetization]] disappears when the magnet is heated to the [[Curie point]], which for iron is {{convert|768|C|F}}.\n\nAn [[antiferromagnetism|antiferromagnet]] has two networks of equal and opposite magnetic moments, which cancel each other out so that the net magnetization is zero. For example, in [[nickel(II) oxide]] (NiO), half the nickel atoms have moments aligned in one direction and half in the opposite direction.\n\nIn a [[ferrimagnetism|ferrimagnet]], the two networks of magnetic moments are opposite but unequal, so that cancellation is incomplete and there is a non-zero net magnetization. An example is [[magnetite]] (Fe{{sub|3}}O{{sub|4}}), which contains Fe{{sup|2+}} and Fe{{sup|3+}} ions with different magnetic moments.\n\nA [[quantum spin liquid]] (QSL) is a disordered state in a system of interacting quantum spins which preserves its disorder to very low temperatures, unlike other disordered states. It is not a liquid in physical sense, but a solid whose magnetic order is inherently disordered. The name \"liquid\" is due to an analogy with the molecular disorder in a conventional liquid. A QSL is neither a [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnet]], where magnetic domains are parallel, nor an [[Antiferromagnetism|antiferromagnet]], where the magnetic domains are antiparallel; instead, the magnetic domains are randomly oriented. This can be realized e.g. by [[Geometrical frustration|geometrically frustrated]] magnetic moments that cannot point uniformly parallel or antiparallel. When cooling down and settling to a state, the domain must \"choose\" an orientation, but if the possible states are similar in energy, one will be chosen randomly. Consequently, despite strong short-range order, there is no long-range magnetic order.\n\n===Microphase-separated===\n{{Main|Copolymer}}\n\n[[File:Sbs block copolymer.jpg|thumb|right|SBS block copolymer in [[Transmission electron microscopy|TEM]]]] [[Copolymers]] can undergo microphase separation to form a diverse array of periodic nanostructures, as shown in the example of the [[Kraton (polymer)|styrene-butadiene-styrene block copolymer]] shown at right. Microphase separation can be understood by analogy to the phase separation between [[oil]] and water. Due to chemical incompatibility between the blocks, block copolymers undergo a similar phase separation. However, because the blocks are [[covalent bond|covalently bonded]] to each other, they cannot demix macroscopically as water and oil can, and so instead the blocks form [[nanometer]]-sized structures. Depending on the relative lengths of each block and the overall block topology of the polymer, many morphologies can be obtained, each its own phase of matter.\n\n[[Ionic liquid]]s also display microphase separation. The anion and cation are not necessarily compatible and would demix otherwise, but electric charge attraction prevents them from separating. Their anions and cations appear to diffuse within compartmentalized layers or micelles instead of freely as in a uniform liquid.<ref>\u00c1lvarez, V.H.; Dosil, N.; Gonzalez-Cabaleiro, R.; Mattedi, S.; Martin-Pastor, M.; Iglesias, M. & Navaza, J.M.: Br\u00f8nsted Ionic Liquids for Sustainable Processes: Synthesis and Physical Properties.

This was discovered in 1937 for [[helium]], which forms a superfluid below the [[lambda point|lambda temperature]] of {{convert|2.17|K|C}} (with {{Convert|\u2212270.98|C|F}}). In this state it will attempt to \"climb\" out of its container.<ref>\n{{Cite web\n |author      = J.R.

Placing a superfluid in a spinning container will result in [[quantum vortex|quantized vortices]].\n\nThese properties are explained by the theory that the common isotope [[helium-4]] forms a [[Bose\u2013Einstein condensate]] (see next section) in the superfluid state. More recently, [[Fermionic condensate]] superfluids have been formed at even lower temperatures by the rare isotope [[helium-3]] and by [[Isotopes of lithium|lithium-6]].<ref>\n{{Cite web\n |author      = L.

In a BEC, matter stops behaving as independent particles, and collapses into a single quantum state that can be described with a single, uniform wavefunction.\n\nIn the gas phase, the Bose\u2013Einstein condensate remained an unverified theoretical prediction for many years. In 1995, the research groups of [[Eric Cornell]] and [[Carl Wieman]], of [[JILA]] at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]], produced the first such condensate experimentally. A Bose\u2013Einstein condensate is \"colder\" than a solid. It may occur when atoms have very similar (or the same) [[Energy level|quantum levels]], at temperatures very close to [[absolute zero]], {{convert|\u2212273.15|C|F}}.\n\n===Fermionic condensate===\n{{main|Fermionic condensate}}\nA ''fermionic condensate'' is similar to the Bose\u2013Einstein condensate but composed of [[fermion]]s. The [[Pauli exclusion principle]] prevents fermions from entering the same quantum state, but a pair of fermions can behave as a boson, and multiple such pairs can then enter the same quantum state without restriction.\n\n===Rydberg molecule===\nOne of the [[metastable state]]s of strongly non-ideal plasma is [[Rydberg matter]], which forms upon condensation of [[excited state|excited atoms]]. These atoms can also turn into [[ion]]s and [[electron]]s if they reach a certain temperature. In April 2009, ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' reported the creation of Rydberg molecules from a Rydberg atom and a [[ground state]] atom,<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |author=V.

A ''[[Quantum spin Hall effect|quantum spin Hall state]]'' is a theoretical phase that may pave the way for the development of electronic devices that dissipate less energy and generate less heat. This is a derivation of the Quantum Hall state of matter.\n\n===Photonic matter===\n{{main|Photonic matter}}\nPhotonic matter is a phenomenon where [[photon]]s interacting with a gas develop apparent mass, and can interact with each other, even forming photonic \"molecules\". The source of mass is the gas, which is massive. This is in contrast to photons moving in empty space, which have no [[rest mass]], and cannot interact.\n\n===Dropleton===\n{{main|Dropleton}}\nA \"quantum fog\" of electrons and holes that flow around each other and even ripple like a liquid, rather than existing as discrete pairs.<ref name=\"Luntz\">{{cite web|last1=Luntz|first1=Stephen|title=New State of Matter Discovered|url=http://www.iflscience.com/physics/new-state-matter-discovered/#3Oe9x65kkHViXABt.99|website=IFLScience|accessdate=16 April 2017|language=en|date=3 January 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170416224429/http://www.iflscience.com/physics/new-state-matter-discovered/#3Oe9x65kkHViXABt.99|archivedate=16 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n==High-energy states==\n\n===Degenerate matter===\n{{Main|Degenerate matter}}\nUnder extremely high pressure, as in the cores of dead stars, ordinary matter undergoes a transition to a series of exotic states of matter collectively known as [[degenerate matter]], which are supported mainly by quantum mechanical effects. In physics, \"degenerate\" refers to two states that have the same energy and are thus interchangeable. Degenerate matter is supported by the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], which prevents two [[fermion]]ic particles from occupying the same quantum state. Unlike regular plasma, degenerate plasma expands little when heated, because there are simply no momentum states left. Consequently, degenerate stars collapse into very high densities. More massive degenerate stars are smaller, because the gravitational force increases, but pressure does not increase proportionally.\n\n[[Degenerate matter|Electron-degenerate matter]] is found inside [[white dwarf]] stars. Electrons remain bound to atoms but are able to transfer to adjacent atoms. [[Degenerate matter|Neutron-degenerate matter]] is found in [[neutron star]]s. Vast gravitational pressure compresses atoms so strongly that the electrons are forced to combine with protons via inverse beta-decay, resulting in a superdense conglomeration of neutrons. Normally [[Neutron|free neutrons]] outside an atomic nucleus will [[Radioactive decay|decay]] with a half life of just under 15 minutes, but in a neutron star, the decay is overtaken by inverse decay. Cold degenerate matter is also present in planets such as [[Jupiter]] and in the even more massive [[brown dwarf]]s, which are expected to have a core with [[metallic hydrogen]]. Because of the degeneracy, more massive brown dwarfs are not significantly larger. In metals, the electrons can be modeled as a degenerate gas moving in a lattice of non-degenerate positive ions.\n\n===Quark matter===\n{{Main|QCD matter}}\nIn regular cold matter, [[quark]]s, fundamental particles of nuclear matter, are confined by the [[strong force]] into [[hadron]]s that consist of 2\u20134 quarks, such as protons and neutrons. Quark matter or quantum chromodynanamical (QCD) matter is a group of phases where the strong force is overcome and quarks are deconfined and free to move. Quark matter phases occur at extremely high densities or temperatures, and there are no known ways to produce them in equilibrium in the laboratory; in ordinary conditions, any quark matter formed immediately undergoes radioactive decay.\n\n[[Strange matter]] is a type of [[quark matter]] that is suspected to exist inside some neutron stars close to the [[Tolman\u2013Oppenheimer\u2013Volkoff limit]] (approximately 2\u20133 [[solar mass]]es), although there is no direct evidence of its existence. In strange matter, part of the energy available manifests as [[strange quark]]s, a heavier analogue of the common [[down quark]]. It may be stable at lower energy states once formed, although this is not known.\n\n[[Quark\u2013gluon plasma]] is a very high-temperature phase in which [[quark]]s become free and able to move independently, rather than being perpetually bound into particles, in a sea of [[gluon]]s, subatomic particles that transmit the [[strong interaction|strong force]] that binds quarks together. This is analogous to the liberation of electrons from atoms in a plasma. This state is briefly attainable in extremely high-energy heavy ion collisions in [[particle accelerator]]s, and allows scientists to observe the properties of individual quarks, and not just theorize. Quark\u2013gluon plasma was discovered at [[CERN]] in 2000. Unlike plasma, which flows like a gas, interactions within QGP are strong and it flows like a liquid.\n\nAt high densities but relatively low temperatures, quarks are theorized to form a quark liquid whose nature is presently unknown. It forms a distinct [[Color\u2013flavor locking|color-flavor locked]] (CFL) phase at even higher densities. This phase is [[superconductive]] for color charge. These phases may occur in [[neutron star]]s but they are presently theoretical.\n\n===Color-glass condensate===\n{{Main|Color-glass condensate}}\nColor-glass condensate is a type of matter theorized to exist in atomic nuclei traveling near the speed of light. According to Einstein's theory of relativity, a high-energy nucleus appears length contracted, or compressed, along its direction of motion. As a result, the gluons inside the nucleus appear to a stationary observer as a \"gluonic wall\" traveling near the speed of light. At very high energies, the density of the gluons in this wall is seen to increase greatly. Unlike the quark\u2013gluon plasma produced in the collision of such walls, the color-glass condensate describes the walls themselves, and is an intrinsic property of the particles that can only be observed under high-energy conditions such as those at RHIC and possibly at the Large Hadron Collider as well.\n\n==Very high energy states==\nVarious theories predict new states of matter at very high energies. An unknown state has created the [[baryon asymmetry]] in the universe, but little is known about it. In [[string theory]], a [[Hagedorn temperature]] is predicted for superstrings at about 10<sup>30</sup> K, where superstrings are copiously produced. At [[Planck temperature]] (10<sup>32</sup> K), gravity becomes a significant force between individual particles. No current theory can describe these states and they cannot be produced with any foreseeable experiment. However, these states are important in [[cosmology]] because the universe may have passed through these states in the [[Big Bang]].\n\nThe '''[[gravitational singularity]]''' predicted by [[general relativity]] to exist at the center of a [[black hole]] is ''not'' a phase of matter; it is not a material object at all (although the mass-energy of matter contributed to its creation) but rather a property of [[spacetime]] at a location. It could be argued, of course, that all particles are properties of spacetime at a location,<ref>{{cite book|author1=David Chalmers|author2=David Manley|author3=Ryan Wasserman|title=Metametaphysics: New Essays on the Foundations of Ontology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6nqzIi16CY0C&pg=PA378|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-954604-6|pages=378\u2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140917070144/http://books.google.com/books?id=6nqzIi16CY0C&pg=PA378|archivedate=17 September 2014}}</ref> leaving a half-note of controversy on the subject.\n\n==Other proposed states==\n\n===Supersolid===\n{{Main|Supersolid}}\nA supersolid is a spatially ordered material (that is, a solid or crystal) with superfluid properties. Similar to a superfluid, a supersolid is able to move without friction but retains a rigid shape. Although a supersolid is a solid, it exhibits so many characteristic properties different from other solids that many argue it is another state of matter.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |author=G.

When in a normal solid state, the atoms of matter align themselves in a grid pattern, so that the spin of any electron is the opposite of the spin of all electrons touching it. But in a string-net liquid, atoms are arranged in some pattern that requires some electrons to have neighbors with the same spin. This gives rise to curious properties, as well as supporting some unusual proposals about the fundamental conditions of the universe itself.\n\n===Superglass===\n{{Main|Superglass}}\nA superglass is a phase of matter characterized, at the same time, by [[superfluid]]ity and a frozen amorphous structure.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Hidden states of matter]]\n* [[Classical element]]\n* [[Condensed matter physics]]\n* [[Cooling curve]]\n* [[Phase (matter)]]\n* [[Supercooling]]\n* [[Superheating]]\n{{Table_of_phase_transitions}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|States of aggregation}}\n* [http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2005/matter.html 2005-06-22, MIT News: MIT physicists create new form of matter] Citat: \"...&nbsp;They have become the first to create a new type of matter, a gas of atoms that shows high-temperature superfluidity.\"\n* [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/10/031010075634.htm 2003-10-10, Science Daily: Metallic Phase For Bosons Implies New State Of Matter]\n* [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2004/01/040115074553.htm 2004-01-15, ScienceDaily: Probable Discovery Of A New, Supersolid, Phase Of Matter] Citat: \"...We apparently have observed, for the first time, a solid material with the characteristics of a superfluid...but because all its particles are in the identical quantum state, it remains a solid even though its component particles are continually flowing...\"\n* [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2004/01/040129073547.htm 2004-01-29, ScienceDaily: NIST/University Of Colorado Scientists Create New Form Of Matter: A Fermionic Condensate]\n* [http://vega.org.uk/video/subseries/30 Short videos demonstrating of States of Matter, solids, liquids and gases by Prof. J M Murrell, University of Sussex]\n\n{{State of matter|state=expanded}}\n{{Condensed matter physics topics}}\n{{Authority control}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2019}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:State Of Matter}}\n[[Category:Condensed matter physics]]\n[[Category:Engineering thermodynamics]]\n[[Category:Phases of matter| ]]\n[[Category:Physics-related lists|States of matter]]\n", "name_user": "Netoholic", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePlasma:post-move link fix", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_matter"}
