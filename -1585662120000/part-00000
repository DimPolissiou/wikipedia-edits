{"title_page": "List of phobias", "text_new": "{{redirect|-phobia|the class of psychological disorders|Phobia}}\n{{pp-semi-indef|small=yes}}\n{{short description|Wikimedia list article}}\n\n<!--\n\nNote to editors:\n\n   There are many made-up words for specific phobias that can be found out on the Internet. Please don't add any phobias to this list unless you can provide a reliable source that establishes that the name is actually used for a real medical condition, or there is a Wikipedia article that provides at least one such source.\n\n -->\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2013}}\n\nThe [[English language|English]] suffixes '''-phobia''', '''-phobic''', '''-phobe''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] \u03c6\u03cc\u03b2\u03bf\u03c2 ''phobos'', \"fear\") occur in technical usage in [[psychiatry]] to construct words that describe irrational, [[abnormal]], unwarranted, persistent, or disabling [[fear]] as a mental disorder (e.g. [[agoraphobia]]), in [[chemistry]] to describe chemical aversions (e.g. [[hydrophobic]]), in [[biology]] to describe organisms that dislike certain conditions (e.g. [[acidophobia]]), and in [[medicine]] to describe hypersensitivity to a stimulus, usually sensory (e.g. [[photophobia]]). In common usage, they also form words that describe dislike or hatred of a particular thing or subject (e.g. [[homophobia]]). The suffix is [[antonym]]ic to [[-phil-]].\n\nFor more information on the psychiatric side, including how psychiatry groups phobias such as agoraphobia, social phobia, or simple phobia, see [[phobia]]. The following lists include words ending in ''-phobia'', and include fears that have acquired names. In some cases, the naming of phobias has become a [[word game]], of notable example being a 1998 humorous article published by ''[[BBC News]]''.<ref name=bbc>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/entertainment/173250.stm The A\u2013Z of Fear], a 30 October 1998 ''[[BBC News]]'' unsigned article in the \"Entertainment\" section</ref> In some cases, a word ending in ''-phobia'' may have an [[antonym]] with the suffix ''[[-phil-]]'', e.g. [[Anti-German sentiment|Germanophobe]]/[[Germanophile]].\n\nMany ''-phobia'' lists circulate on the Internet, with words collected from indiscriminate sources, often copying each other. Also, a number of psychiatric websites exist that at the first glance cover a huge number of phobias, but in fact use a standard text to fit any phobia and reuse it for all unusual phobias by merely changing the name. Sometimes it leads to bizarre results, such as suggestions to cure \"prostitute phobia\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.webpronews.com/insidesearch/insidesearch/wpn-56-20050825ContentSpammersHelpYouOvercomeProstitutePhobia.html|title=Content Spammers Help You Overcome Prostitute Phobia |publisher=Webpronews.com |date=25 August 2005 |accessdate=26 August 2013}}</ref> Such practice is known as [[content spamming]] and is used to attract [[Web search engine|search engines]].\n\nAn article published in 1897 in ''[[American Journal of Psychology]]'' noted \"the absurd tendency to give Greek names to objects feared (which, as [[Rudolf Arndt|Arndt]] says, would give us such terms as klopsophobia \u2013 fear of thieves, {{notatypo|triakaidekaphobia}}<!--written this way in the source --> \u2013 fear of the number 13....\".<ref>{{Cite journal |first=G.

In common usage, they also form words that describe dislike or hatred of a particular thing or subject (e.g. [[homophobia]]). The suffix is [[antonym]]ic to [[-phil-]].\n\nFor more information on the psychiatric side, including how psychiatry groups phobias such as agoraphobia, social phobia, or simple phobia, see [[phobia]]. The following lists include words ending in ''-phobia'', and include fears that have acquired names. In some cases, the naming of phobias has become a [[word game]], of notable example being a 1998 humorous article published by ''[[BBC News]]''.<ref name=bbc>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/entertainment/173250.stm The A\u2013Z of Fear], a 30 October 1998 ''[[BBC News]]'' unsigned article in the \"Entertainment\" section</ref> In some cases, a word ending in ''-phobia'' may have an [[antonym]] with the suffix ''[[-phil-]]'', e.g. [[Anti-German sentiment|Germanophobe]]/[[Germanophile]].\n\nMany ''-phobia'' lists circulate on the Internet, with words collected from indiscriminate sources, often copying each other. Also, a number of psychiatric websites exist that at the first glance cover a huge number of phobias, but in fact use a standard text to fit any phobia and reuse it for all unusual phobias by merely changing the name. Sometimes it leads to bizarre results, such as suggestions to cure \"prostitute phobia\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.webpronews.com/insidesearch/insidesearch/wpn-56-20050825ContentSpammersHelpYouOvercomeProstitutePhobia.html|title=Content Spammers Help You Overcome Prostitute Phobia |publisher=Webpronews.com |date=25 August 2005 |accessdate=26 August 2013}}</ref> Such practice is known as [[content spamming]] and is used to attract [[Web search engine|search engines]].\n\nAn article published in 1897 in ''[[American Journal of Psychology]]'' noted \"the absurd tendency to give Greek names to objects feared (which, as [[Rudolf Arndt|Arndt]] says, would give us such terms as klopsophobia \u2013 fear of thieves, {{notatypo|triakaidekaphobia}}<!--written this way in the source --> \u2013 fear of the number 13....\".<ref>{{Cite journal |first=G.

The tank had a level gauge that employees used to monitor the level manually, and an independent high-level switch which would shut off inflow if the level got above a certain setpoint. On Tank 912, the manual gauge was stuck and the independent shut-off switch was inoperative, meaning that the tank was being \"filled blind\" with petrol (i.e., being filled without a clear indication of the level). Eventually Tank 912 filled up completely, the petrol overflowed through vents at the top, and formed a vapour cloud near ground level, which ignited and exploded. The fires from the explosion then lasted for five days.<ref name=\"ThisOutdatedArticleNeedsThisReport\"/>\n\nThe investigation found that the level gauge had stuck at random times after a tank service in August 2005, but it did not concern maintenance contractors or site management. The independent shut-off switch was not fitted with a critical padlock to allow its check lever to work. Secondary containment (meant to trap the petrol in a retaining wall around the tank) failed and allowed petrol to flow out. Tertiary containment (drains and catchment areas to prevent release of spilled chemicals to the environment) also failed, and fuel and firefighting foam entered groundwater supplies. The investigation found secondary and tertiary containment to be inadequately designed and poorly maintained.<ref name=\"ThisOutdatedArticleNeedsThisReport\"/>\n\nWider management failings were found by the investigation to have contributed to the explosion: management safety checks at the site were found to be deficient and not properly followed. Site staff did not have control over the flow rates and timing of two of the three inlet sources, meaning that they did not have enough information to properly manage the storage of incoming fuel. Further, overall throughput had increased, reducing wait times further and shifting the emphasis to process operations instead of process safety.<ref name=\"ThisOutdatedArticleNeedsThisReport\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{update-section|date=January 2018}}\nSoon after the incident the Health Protection Agency was stripped of its remit to provide air quality data and it was passed on to the Environment Agency which forms part of the Major Accident Investigation Board.\n\n== Remembrance ==\nAn anniversary service was held in Holy Trinity Church [[Leverstock Green]] on Sunday, 10 December 2006, at which the Bishop of St Albans spoke, calling again for a full public inquiry, for assurances that the local hospital would maintain its accident and emergency department, and for the community to continue to build on good relationships formed because of the blast.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.stalbans.anglican.org/The-Diocese-and-You/Bishops/Archive/Sermons-and-speeches/Buncefield-Anniversary-Service,-Sunday-10-December-2006 \n |title=Buncefield Anniversary Service, Sunday 10 December 2006 \n |publisher=St Albans Diocese \n |accessdate=20 November 2009 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607064734/http://www.stalbans.anglican.org/The-Diocese-and-You/Bishops/Archive/Sermons-and-speeches/Buncefield-Anniversary-Service%2C-Sunday-10-December-2006 \n |archivedate=7 June 2011 \n |df=dmy \n}}</ref>\n\n=== Reconstruction ===\nTo rebuild the damaged parts of the site, the relevant approval from Dacorum Borough Council would be needed.

The tank had a level gauge that employees used to monitor the level manually, and an independent high-level switch which would shut off inflow if the level got above a certain setpoint. On Tank 912, the manual gauge was stuck and the independent shut-off switch was inoperative, meaning that the tank was being \"filled blind\" with petrol (i.e., being filled without a clear indication of the level). Eventually Tank 912 filled up completely, the petrol overflowed through vents at the top, and formed a vapour cloud near ground level, which ignited and exploded. The fires from the explosion then lasted for five days.<ref name=\"ThisOutdatedArticleNeedsThisReport\"/>\n\nThe investigation found that the level gauge had stuck at random times after a tank service in August 2005, but it did not concern maintenance contractors or site management. The independent shut-off switch was not fitted with a critical padlock to allow its check lever to work. Secondary containment (meant to trap the petrol in a retaining wall around the tank) failed and allowed petrol to flow out. Tertiary containment (drains and catchment areas to prevent release of spilled chemicals to the environment) also failed, and fuel and firefighting foam entered groundwater supplies. The investigation found secondary and tertiary containment to be inadequately designed and poorly maintained.<ref name=\"ThisOutdatedArticleNeedsThisReport\"/>\n\nWider management failings were found by the investigation to have contributed to the explosion: management safety checks at the site were found to be deficient and not properly followed. Site staff did not have control over the flow rates and timing of two of the three inlet sources, meaning that they did not have enough information to properly manage the storage of incoming fuel. Further, overall throughput had increased, reducing wait times further and shifting the emphasis to process operations instead of process safety.<ref name=\"ThisOutdatedArticleNeedsThisReport\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{update-section|date=January 2018}}\nSoon after the incident the Health Protection Agency was stripped of its remit to provide air quality data and it was passed on to the Environment Agency which forms part of the Major Accident Investigation Board.\n\n== Remembrance ==\nAn anniversary service was held in Holy Trinity Church [[Leverstock Green]] on Sunday, 10 December 2006, at which the Bishop of St Albans spoke, calling again for a full public inquiry, for assurances that the local hospital would maintain its accident and emergency department, and for the community to continue to build on good relationships formed because of the blast.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.stalbans.anglican.org/The-Diocese-and-You/Bishops/Archive/Sermons-and-speeches/Buncefield-Anniversary-Service,-Sunday-10-December-2006 \n |title=Buncefield Anniversary Service, Sunday 10 December 2006 \n |publisher=St Albans Diocese \n |accessdate=20 November 2009 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607064734/http://www.stalbans.anglican.org/The-Diocese-and-You/Bishops/Archive/Sermons-and-speeches/Buncefield-Anniversary-Service%2C-Sunday-10-December-2006 \n |archivedate=7 June 2011 \n |df=dmy \n}}</ref>\n\n=== Reconstruction ===\nTo rebuild the damaged parts of the site, the relevant approval from Dacorum Borough Council would be needed.

Some scholars objected to the participation of women, but Muhammad Ilyas slowly gained their support and the first ''jamaat'' of women was formed in Nizamuddin, Delhi.<ref name=womenbm/> Accompanied by a close male relative, (\u0645\u062d\u0631\u0645), that is husband, brother, father or son, women are encouraged to go out in jamaats and work among other women and family members while following the rules of modesty, seclusion and segregation. They observe strict rules of hijab by covering their faces and hands.<ref name=daily/><ref name=womenbm/> ''Jamaats'' of women sometimes participate in large annual meetings; otherwise, they commonly hold neighbourhood meetings. Since South Asian Islamic culture discourages women from going to the mosque and saintly shrines, these venues offer an opportunity for women to pray together and congregate religiously.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\nIn many modern Islamist movements, women have been relegated to a domestic role. Tablighi Jamaat tends to blur the boundaries of gender roles and both genders share a common behavioural model and their commitment to tabligh. The emphasis is on a common nature and responsibilities shared by both genders. Just as men redraw the gender roles when they wash and cook during the course of ''da'wa'' tours, women undertake the male responsibility of sustaining the household.<ref name=womenbm/> Women do not play any role in the higher echelons of the movement,<ref name=daily/> but their opinions are taken into due considerations. Women and the family members are being to told to learn Quran and follow 5 Amaals in every day life, Taleem of Ahadees, Quran recitation,6 Points muzakera, and mashwara for daily life work and fikr for the whole world as people from around the world will be coming and they are the one who has to learn before they teach.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\n==Controversies==\n[[File:Cot Goh.jpg|thumb|Mushawara after Bayan Subh at Tablighi Jamaat center in Cot Goh, [[Montasik]], [[Aceh Besar]], [[Aceh]]]]\n\n===Criticism===\nDue to the orthodox nature of Tablighi Jamaat, they have been criticised for being retrogressive. The women in the movement observe complete [[hijab]] for which the Tablighi Jamaat is accused of keeping women \"strictly subservient and second string\".<ref name=daily/>\n\nTablighi Jamaat has also been criticized within Islamic circles and the major opposition in the Indian subcontinent comes from the [[Barelvi]] movement. One of the main criticisms against them is that the men neglect and ignore their families, especially by going out on ''da'wa'' tours. Tablighi Jamaat participants, in response, argue that both genders should be equally engaged in Tabligh. They further say that women, like men, are also urged to carry the responsibility of Tabligh and that men should facilitate women's participation by providing childcare.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\nMany critics, especially those from [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] and [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]], criticize Tabligh Jamaat for their neutral political stance. They say that Islamist forces, during their conflicts with secular or non-Islamist opponents, could have been helped by Tablighi Jamaat followers. Specifically they criticize the Tabligh Jamaat's neutral position towards issues in South Asia such as the introduction of an [[Constitution of Pakistan of 1956|Islamic constitution in Pakistan]] (1950s), Islam vs Socialism (1969\u20131971), communal riots in India in the 1970s and 1980s, the Khatm-e-Nabuwwat Movement (1974), and [[Tehreek Nizam-e-Mustafa|Nizam-e-Mustafa Movement]] (1977).<ref name=AMFO1994:518>[[#AMFO1994|Ahmed, \"Islamic Fundamentalism in South Asia\", 1994]]: p.518</ref> The Tablighi Jamaat, in response, states that it is only by avoiding the political debates that the Tablighi Jamaat has been successful in reawakening the spiritual conscience of the followers. The apolitical stance also helped them operate in difficult times, such as during the governments of [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] (1960s) and [[Indira Gandhi]] (1975\u201377), when other sociopolitical Islamic groups faced restrictions.<ref name=AMFO1994:518/>\n\nThe difference of opinion regarding political participation also marks the fundamental difference between the Tablighi Jamaat and Islamist movements. While the Islamists believe that the acquisition of political power is the absolute requirement for the establishment of an Islamic society, the Tablighi Jamaat believes that merely the political power is not enough to ensure effective organisation of the Islamic social order.<ref name=AMFO1994:519>[[#AMFO1994|Ahmed, \"Islamic Fundamentalism in South Asia\", 1994]]: p.519</ref> The exclusive focus of the Tablighi Jamaat's attention is the individual, and members believe the reformation of society and institutions will only be effective through education and reform of individuals. They insist that nations and social systems exist by the virtue of the individuals who form them; therefore, the reform must begin at the grass-roots with individuals and not at the higher level of political structure.<ref name=AMFO1994:517>[[#AMFO1994|Ahmed, \"Islamic Fundamentalism in South Asia\", 1994]]: p.517</ref>\n\nTJ have also been accused of insufficient orthodoxy and association with [[Sufism|Sufis]].<ref name=FAttatj>{{cite web |title=Fadhaa'il A'maal & the truth about Tableegh Jaam'aat.

Some scholars objected to the participation of women, but Muhammad Ilyas slowly gained their support and the first ''jamaat'' of women was formed in Nizamuddin, Delhi.<ref name=womenbm/> Accompanied by a close male relative, (\u0645\u062d\u0631\u0645), that is husband, brother, father or son, women are encouraged to go out in jamaats and work among other women and family members while following the rules of modesty, seclusion and segregation. They observe strict rules of hijab by covering their faces and hands.<ref name=daily/><ref name=womenbm/> ''Jamaats'' of women sometimes participate in large annual meetings; otherwise, they commonly hold neighbourhood meetings. Since South Asian Islamic culture discourages women from going to the mosque and saintly shrines, these venues offer an opportunity for women to pray together and congregate religiously.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\nIn many modern Islamist movements, women have been relegated to a domestic role. Tablighi Jamaat tends to blur the boundaries of gender roles and both genders share a common behavioural model and their commitment to tabligh. The emphasis is on a common nature and responsibilities shared by both genders. Just as men redraw the gender roles when they wash and cook during the course of ''da'wa'' tours, women undertake the male responsibility of sustaining the household.<ref name=womenbm/> Women do not play any role in the higher echelons of the movement,<ref name=daily/> but their opinions are taken into due considerations.

The women in the movement observe complete [[hijab]] for which the Tablighi Jamaat is accused of keeping women \"strictly subservient and second string\".<ref name=daily/>\n\nTablighi Jamaat has also been criticized within Islamic circles and the major opposition in the Indian subcontinent comes from the [[Barelvi]] movement. One of the main criticisms against them is that the men neglect and ignore their families, especially by going out on ''da'wa'' tours. Tablighi Jamaat participants, in response, argue that both genders should be equally engaged in Tabligh. They further say that women, like men, are also urged to carry the responsibility of Tabligh and that men should facilitate women's participation by providing childcare.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\nMany critics, especially those from [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] and [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]], criticize Tabligh Jamaat for their neutral political stance. They say that Islamist forces, during their conflicts with secular or non-Islamist opponents, could have been helped by Tablighi Jamaat followers. Specifically they criticize the Tabligh Jamaat's neutral position towards issues in South Asia such as the introduction of an [[Constitution of Pakistan of 1956|Islamic constitution in Pakistan]] (1950s), Islam vs Socialism (1969\u20131971), communal riots in India in the 1970s and 1980s, the Khatm-e-Nabuwwat Movement (1974), and [[Tehreek Nizam-e-Mustafa|Nizam-e-Mustafa Movement]] (1977).<ref name=AMFO1994:518>[[#AMFO1994|Ahmed, \"Islamic Fundamentalism in South Asia\", 1994]]: p.518</ref> The Tablighi Jamaat, in response, states that it is only by avoiding the political debates that the Tablighi Jamaat has been successful in reawakening the spiritual conscience of the followers. The apolitical stance also helped them operate in difficult times, such as during the governments of [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] (1960s) and [[Indira Gandhi]] (1975\u201377), when other sociopolitical Islamic groups faced restrictions.<ref name=AMFO1994:518/>\n\nThe difference of opinion regarding political participation also marks the fundamental difference between the Tablighi Jamaat and Islamist movements. While the Islamists believe that the acquisition of political power is the absolute requirement for the establishment of an Islamic society, the Tablighi Jamaat believes that merely the political power is not enough to ensure effective organisation of the Islamic social order.<ref name=AMFO1994:519>[[#AMFO1994|Ahmed, \"Islamic Fundamentalism in South Asia\", 1994]]: p.519</ref> The exclusive focus of the Tablighi Jamaat's attention is the individual, and members believe the reformation of society and institutions will only be effective through education and reform of individuals. They insist that nations and social systems exist by the virtue of the individuals who form them; therefore, the reform must begin at the grass-roots with individuals and not at the higher level of political structure.<ref name=AMFO1994:517>[[#AMFO1994|Ahmed, \"Islamic Fundamentalism in South Asia\", 1994]]: p.517</ref>\n\nTJ have also been accused of insufficient orthodoxy and association with [[Sufism|Sufis]].<ref name=FAttatj>{{cite web |title=Fadhaa'il A'maal & the truth about Tableegh Jaam'aat.
