The film was directed by [[John Lasseter]] from a screenplay by [[Dan Fogelman]], Lasseter, [[Joe Ranft]], Kiel Murray, Phil Lorin, and [[Jorgen Klubien]] and a story by Lasseter, Ranft, and Klubien, and was the final film independently produced by Pixar before its purchase by Disney in January 2006. Set in a world populated entirely by [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] talking cars and other vehicles, the film stars the voices of [[Owen Wilson]], [[Paul Newman]] (in his final acting role), [[Bonnie Hunt]], [[Larry the Cable Guy]], [[Tony Shalhoub]], [[Cheech Marin]], [[Michael Wallis]], [[George Carlin]], [[Paul Dooley]], [[Jenifer Lewis]], [[Guido Quaroni]], [[Michael Keaton]], [[Katherine Helmond]], [[John Ratzenberger]] and [[Richard Petty]], while race car drivers [[Dale Earnhardt Jr.]] (as \"Junior\"), [[Mario Andretti]], [[Michael Schumacher]] and car enthusiast [[Jay Leno]] (as \"Jay Limo\") voice themselves.\n\n''Cars'' premiered on May 26, 2006 at [[Lowe's Motor Speedway]] in [[Concord, North Carolina]] and was theatrically released in the United States on June 9, 2006 to generally positive reviews and also received commercial success, grossing $462 million worldwide against a budget of $120 million. It was nominated for two [[Academy Awards]] including [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature|Best Animated Feature]], but lost to ''[[Happy Feet]]'' (but won both the [[Annie Award for Best Animated Feature]] and the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film]]). The film was released on DVD on November 7, 2006 and on [[Blu-ray]] in 2007. The film was accompanied by the short ''[[One Man Band (film)|One Man Band]]'' for its theatrical and home media releases.

Lightning is still desperate to win the race, not only to be the first rookie to win the Piston Cup, but also because it would allow him to leave the unglamorous sponsorship of Rust-Eze, a bumper ointment company, and take The King's place on the prestigious and lucrative Dinoco team. Lightning struggles to work well with others due to his arrogance, which has resulted in him firing three crew chiefs and having his pit crew quit following the race.  Eager to get to California as soon as possible, he pushes his [[Semi-trailer truck|big rig]], [[Mack (Cars)|Mack]], to travel all night long. While Lightning is sleeping, Mack nods off and is startled awake, causing Lightning to fall out the back of the trailer and onto the road. Lightning wakes up in the middle of traffic and speeds off the highway in search of Mack, but instead ends up in the rundown desert town of [[Radiator Springs]], where he inadvertently damages the pavement of the main road.\n\nThe next day, Lightning is ordered by the town judge, [[Doc Hudson]], to leave the town immediately, but the local lawyer, [[Sally Carrera|Sally]], requests that Lightning should instead be assigned [[community service]] to repave the road, to which Doc reluctantly agrees. Still in a rush to leave town, Lightning escapes after Mater takes the boot off of him, but is later brought back to repave the road, which he still rushes to do. During this time, he begins to warm to the town, and befriends several of its residents. He learns that Radiator Springs was once a prosperous and thriving town that served as a popular stop along [[U.S. Route 66]] until the highway was bypassed with the construction of the [[Interstate System]] and mostly unforgotten, and that Doc was the [[Fabulous Hudson Hornet]], a famous three-time Piston Cup champion whose career was cut short following a serious crash in 1954 (Doc still held the most wins in a single season by any Piston Cup racer). He bonds with Sally, who found happiness when she gave up a fast life in LA to live in Radiator Springs, and now dreams of putting the town back on the map. Lightning finishes repaving the road, reinvigorating the town's residents, and decides to spend an extra day in Radiator Springs with his new friends, but his time there is cut short when Mack and the media descend on the town. Lightning reluctantly leaves to reach California in time for the race while Sally chastises Doc upon discovering that he was responsible for tipping off the media to Lightning's whereabouts.\n\nAt the race, Lightning races distractedly and soon falls into last place. He is then surprised to discover that Doc, having a change of heart, has taken over as his crew chief and several of his other friends from Radiator Springs are helping in the pit. Inspired and recalling tricks he learned from Doc and his friends, Lightning quickly emerges to lead the race in the final lap, but at the last minute, Chick, refusing to lose to The King again, sideswipes and sends The King into a dangerous crash. Seeing this on the jumbotron and recalling Doc's fate, Lightning stops just short of the finish line, allowing Chick to win, and drives back to push The King over the finish line and help him finish his last race. As a result, the angered crowd and media condemn Chick's victory while also praising Lightning's sportsmanship. Lightning is offered the Dinoco sponsorship, but declines and insists on staying with Rust-Eze out of loyalty for their past support. Back at Radiator Springs, Lightning reunites with Sally and announces that he will be setting up his racing headquarters there, putting Radiator Springs back on the map.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], [[List of Cars characters|Minny and Van]], a couple who were trying to find the Interstate, are shown lost in a desert.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{see also|List of Cars characters}}\n* [[Owen Wilson]] as [[Lightning McQueen]], described by John Lasseter in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' as \"A hybrid between a stock car and a more curvaceous [[24 Hours of Le Mans#Cars|Le Mans endurance]] racer\".<ref name=\"lagreasegeek\">{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/jun/04/entertainment/ca-cars4 |title=A grease geek will guide you: ''Cars'' decoded |author=Dan Neil |work=Los Angeles Times |date=June 4, 2006 |accessdate=November 1, 2006}}</ref>\n* [[Paul Newman]] as [[Doc Hudson]], a 1951 [[Hudson Hornet]] who is later revealed to be the [[Fabulous Hudson Hornet]] and is Newman's last non-documentary role before retirement in 2007 and death in 2008.\n* [[Bonnie Hunt]] as [[Sally Carrera]], a 2002 [[Porsche 996|996-series]] [[Porsche 911]] Carrera.\n* [[Larry the Cable Guy]] as [[Mater (Cars)|Mater]], a 1951 [[International Harvester]] L-170 \"boom\" truck<ref>{{cite book |author=Michael Wallis |author2=Suzanne Fitzgerald Wallis |title=The Art of Cars |year=2006 |publisher=Chronicle Books |page=4 |quote=In Galena, Kansas, we found a lonely old tow truck that most folks would pass by without a second glance.

In one vein, I have Disney blood, and in the other, there's motor oil. The notion of combining these two great passions in my life\u2014cars and animation\u2014was irresistible. When Joe (Ranft) and I first started talking about this film in 1998, we knew we wanted to do something with cars as characters. Around that same time, we watched a documentary called 'Divided Highways,' which dealt with the interstate highway and how it affected the small towns along the way. We were so moved by it and began thinking about what it must have been like in these small towns that got bypassed. That's when we started really researching Route 66, but we still hadn't quite figured out what the story for the film was going to be. I used to travel that highway with my family as a child when we visited our family in St. Louis.\"<ref name=\"adisney1\"/>\n\nYears later in 2013, Klubien said the film was both his best and most bitter experience because he was fired before it premiered and because he feels Lasseter wrote him out of the story of how the film got made.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Amazing Double Life of Jorgen Klubien |url=http://flipanimation.blogspot.jp/2013/10/the-amazing-double-life-of-jorgen.html |website=FLIP |accessdate=July 3, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Animation===\n[[File:carsanimation.png|thumb|A rendered frame from the development of the film.]]\nFor the cars themselves, Lasseter also visited the design studios of the Big Three Detroit automakers, particularly J Mays of Ford Motor Company.<ref name=\"adisney1\">{{cite web |url=http://adisney.go.com/disneypictures/cars/us/bios/CARSProdNotes.pdf |title=Cars Production Information |date=May 5, 2006 |accessdate=June 2, 2009 |format=PDF}}</ref> Lasseter learned how real cars were designed.<ref name=\"adisney1\"/>\n\nIn 2006, Lasseter spoke about how they worked hard to make the animation believable, saying: \"It took many months of trial and error, and practicing test animation, to figure out how each car moves and how their world works. Our supervising animators, Doug Sweetland and Scott Clark, and the directing animators, Bobby Podesta and James Ford Murphy, did an amazing job working with the animation team to determine the unique movements for each character based on its age and the type of car it was. Some cars are like sports cars and they're much tighter in their suspension. Others are older '50s cars that are a lot looser and have more bounce to them. We wanted to get that authenticity in there but also to make sure each car had a unique personality. We also wanted each animator to be able to put some of themself in the character and give it their own spin. Every day in dailies, it was so much fun because we would see things that we had never seen in our lives. The world of cars came alive in a believable and unexpected way.\"<ref name=\"adisney1\"/>\n\nUnlike most anthropomorphic cars, the eyes of the cars in this film were placed on the windshield (which resembles the [[Tonka]] Talking Trucks, the characters from [[Tex Avery]]'s ''One Cab's Family'' short and Disney's own ''[[Susie the Little Blue Coupe]]''), rather than within the headlights.<ref name=\"adisney1\"/> According to [[production designer]] Bob Pauley, \"From the very beginning of this project, [[John Lasseter]] had it in his mind to have the eyes be in the windshield. For one thing, it separates our characters from the more common approach where you have little cartoon eyes in the headlights. For another, he thought that having the eyes down near the mouth at the front end of the car feels more like a snake. With the eyes set in the windshield, the point of view is more human-like, and made it feel like the whole car could be involved in the animation of the character.<ref name=\"adisney1\"/> This decision was heavily criticized by automotive blog [[Jalopnik]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jalopnik.com/5870976/how-pixar-screwed-up-cartoon-cars-for-a-generation-of-kids |title=How Pixar screwed up cartoon cars for a generation of kids |publisher=Jalopnik.com |accessdate=June 10, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, supervising animator on the film Scott Clark, spoke about the challenges of animating car characters, saying: \"Getting a full range of performance and emotion from these characters and making them still seem like cars was a tough assignment, but that's what animation does best. You use your imagination, and you make the movements and gestures fit with the design. Our car characters may not have arms and legs, but we can lean the tires in or out to suggest hands opening up or closing in. We can use steering to point a certain direction. We also designed a special eyelid and an eyebrow for the windshield that lets us communicate an expressiveness that cars don't have.\"<ref name=\"adisney1\"/> Doug Sweetland, who also served as supervising animator, also spoke about the challenges, saying: \"It took a different kind of animator to really be able to interpret the ''Cars'' models, than it did to interpret something like ''[[The Incredibles]]'' models. With ''The Incredibles'', the animator could get reference for the characters by shooting himself and watching the footage. But with ''Cars'', it departs completely from any reference. Yes they're cars, but no car can do what our characters do. It's pure fantasy. It took a lot of trial and error to get them to look right.\"<ref name=\"adisney1\"/>\n\n[[File:John Lasseter 2 cropped 2009.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Lasseter]] co-wrote and directed the film.]]\nLasseter also explained that the film started with pencil and paper designs, saying: \"Truth to materials. Starting with pencil-and-paper designs from production designer Bob Pauley, and continuing through the modeling, articulation, and shading of the characters, and finally into animation, the production team worked hard to have the car characters remain true to their origins.\"<ref name=\"adisney1\"/> Character department manager Jay Ward also explained how they wanted the cars to look as realistic as possible, saying: \"John didn't want the cars to seem clay-like or mushy. He insisted on truth to materials. This was a huge thing for him. He told us that steel needs to feel like steel. Glass should feel like glass. These cars need to feel heavy. They weigh three or four thousand pounds. When they move around, they need to have that feel. They shouldn't appear light or overly bouncy to the point where the audience might see them as rubber toys.\"<ref name=\"adisney1\"/> According to directing animator James Ford Murphy, \"Originally, the car models were built so they could basically do anything. John kept reminding us that these characters are made of metal and they weigh several thousand pounds. They can't stretch. He showed us examples of very loose animation to illustrate what not to do.\"<ref name=\"adisney1\"/>\n\nCharacter shading supervisor on the film Thomas Jordan explained that chrome and car paint were the main challenges on the film, saying: \"Chrome and car paint were our two main challenges on this film. We started out by learning as much as we could. At the local body shop, we watched them paint a car, and we saw the way they mixed the paint and applied the various coats. We tried to dissect what goes into the real paint and recreated it in the computer. We figured out that we needed a base paint, which is where the color comes from, and the clearcoat, which provides the reflection. We were then able to add in things like metallic flake to give it a glittery sparkle, a pearlescent quality that might change color depending on the angle, and even a layer of pin-striping for characters like Ramone.\"<ref name=\"adisney1\"/> Supervising technical director on the film Eben Ostby explained that the biggest challenge for the technical team was creating the metallic and painted surfaces of the car characters, and the reflections that those surfaces generate, saying: \"Given that the stars of our film are made of metal, John had a real desire to see realistic reflections, and more beautiful lighting than we\u2019ve seen in any of our previous films. In the past, we\u2019ve mostly used environment maps and other matte-based technology to cheat reflections, but for ''Cars'' we added a ray-tracing capability to our existing Renderman program to raise the bar for Pixar.\"<ref name=\"adisney1\"/>\n\nRendering lead Jessica McMackin spoke about the use of ray tracing on the film, saying: \"In addition to creating accurate reflections, we used ray tracing to achieve other effects. We were able to use this approach to create accurate shadows, like when there are multiple light sources and you want to get a feathering of shadows at the edges. Or occlusion, which is the absence of ambient light between two surfaces, like a crease in a shirt. A fourth use is irradiance. An example of this would be if you had a piece of red paper and held it up to a white wall, the light would be colored by the paper and cast a red glow on the wall.\"<ref name=\"adisney1\"/> Character supervisor Tim Milliron explained that the film uses a ground\u2013locking system that kept the cars firmly planted on the road, saying: \"The ground-locking system is one of the things I\u2019m most proud of on this film. In the past, characters have never known about their environment in any way. A simulation pass was required if you wanted to make something like that happen. On ''Cars'', this system is built into the models themselves, and as you move the car around, the vehicle sticks to the ground. It was one of those things that we do at Pixar where we knew going in that it had to be done, but we had no idea how to do it.\"<ref name=\"adisney1\"/>\n\nTechnical director Lisa Forsell explained that to enhance the richness and beauty of the desert landscapes surrounding Radiator Springs, the filmmakers created a department responsible for matte paintings and sky flats, saying: \"Digital matte paintings are a way to get a lot of visual complexity without necessarily having to build complex geometry, and write complex shaders. We spent a lot time working on the clouds and their different formations. They tend to be on several layers and they move relative to each other. The clouds do in fact have some character and personality. The notion was that just as people see themselves in the clouds, cars see various car-shaped clouds. It\u2019s subtle, but there are definitely some that are shaped like a sedan. And if you look closely, you\u2019ll see some that look like tire treads. The fact that so much attention is put on the skies speaks to the visual level of the film. Is there a story point? Not really. There is no pixel on the screen that does not have an extraordinary level of scrutiny and care applied to it. There is nothing that is just throw-away.\"<ref name=\"adisney1\"/>\n\nComputers used in the development of the film were four times faster than those used in ''[[The Incredibles]]'' and 1,000 times faster than those used in ''[[Toy Story]]''. To build the cars, the animators used computer platforms similar to those used in the design of real-world automobiles.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/21/automobiles/21AUTO.html |title=Pixar's ''Cars'' Got Its Kicks on Route 66 |accessdate=April 11, 2009 |author=Phil Patton |date=May 21, 2006 |work=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Main|Cars (soundtrack)}}\nThe [[Cars (soundtrack)|''Cars'' soundtrack]] was released by [[Walt Disney Records]] on June 6, 2006.<ref name=\"allmusic1\">{{cite web |author=Heather Phares |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/cars-original-soundtrack-mw0000768029 |title=Cars [Original Soundtrack&#93; - Original Soundtrack &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |website=AllMusic |date=June 6, 2006 |accessdate=January 7, 2014}}</ref> Nine tracks on the soundtrack are by popular artists, while the remaining eleven are score cues by [[Randy Newman]].<ref name=\"allmusic1\"/> It has two versions of the classic [[Bobby Troup]] jazz standard \"[[Route 66 (song)|Route 66]]\" (popularized by [[Nat King Cole]]), one by [[Chuck Berry]] and a new version recorded specifically for the film's credits performed by [[John Mayer (musician)|John Mayer]].<ref name=\"allmusic1\"/> [[Brad Paisley]] contributed two of the nine tracks to the album, one being \"Find Yourself\" used for the end credits.<ref name=\"allmusic1\"/>\n\n==Release==\n''Cars'' was originally going to be released on November 4, 2005, but on December 7, 2004, its release date was moved to June 9, 2006.<ref name=\"BBCJobs\">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4078711.stm |title=Pixar-Disney delay Cars release |work=BBC News |date=December 8, 2004 |accessdate=June 30, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190206174829/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4078711.stm |archivedate=February 6, 2019}}</ref> Analysts looked at the release date change as a sign from Pixar that they were preparing for the pending end of the Disney distribution contract by either preparing non-Disney materials to present to other studios or they were buying time to see what happened with [[Michael Eisner]]'s situation at Disney.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/dec2004/nf2004129_4222_db035.htm |title=Steve Jobs's Sharp Turn with Cars |work=Business Week |date=December 9, 2004 |accessdate=June 30, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311001731/http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/dec2004/nf2004129_4222_db035.htm |archivedate=March 11, 2007}}</ref>  When Pixar's chief executive [[Steve Jobs]] made the release date announcement, he stated that the reasoning was due to wanting to put all Pixar films on a summer release schedule with DVD sales occurring during the holiday shopping season.<ref name=\"BBCJobs\" />\n\n===Home media===\n''Cars'' was released on DVD, in [[Aspect ratio (image)|wide- and full-screen]] editions, on November 7, 2006 in the United States and Canada.

Lightning is desperate to win the race, not only to be the first rookie to win the Piston Cup, but also because it would allow him to leave the unglamorous sponsorship of Rust-Eze, a bumper ointment company, and take The King's place on the prestigious and lucrative Dinoco team. Lightning struggles to work well with others due to his arrogance, which has resulted in him firing three crew chiefs and having his pit crew quit following the race.  Eager to get to California as soon as possible, he pushes his [[Semi-trailer truck|big rig]], [[Mack (Cars)|Mack]], to travel all night long. While Lightning is sleeping, Mack nods off and is startled awake, causing Lightning to fall out the back of the trailer and onto the road. Lightning wakes up in the middle of traffic and speeds off the highway in search of Mack, but instead ends up in the rundown desert town of [[Radiator Springs]], where he inadvertently damages the pavement of the main road.\n\nThe next day, Lightning is ordered by the town judge, [[Doc Hudson]], to leave town immediately, but the local lawyer, [[Sally Carrera|Sally]], requests that Lightning should instead be assigned [[community service]] to repave the road, to which Doc reluctantly agrees. Still in a rush to leave town, Lightning escapes after Mater takes the boot off of him, but is later brought back to repave the road, which he rushes to do. During this time, he begins to warm to the town, and befriends several of its residents. He learns that Radiator Springs was once a prosperous and thriving town that served as a popular stop along [[U.S. Route 66]] until the highway was bypassed with the construction of the [[Interstate System]] and mostly forgotten, and that Doc was the [[Fabulous Hudson Hornet]], a famous three-time Piston Cup champion whose career was cut short following a serious crash (Doc still held the most wins in a single season by any Piston Cup racer). He bonds with Sally, who found happiness when she gave up a fast life in LA to live in Radiator Springs, and now dreams of putting the town back on the map. Lightning finishes repaving the road, reinvigorating the town's residents, and decides to spend an extra day in Radiator Springs with his new friends, but his time there is cut short when Mack and the media descend on the town. Lightning reluctantly leaves to reach California in time for the race while Sally chastises Doc upon discovering that he was responsible for tipping off the media to Lightning's whereabouts.\n\nAt the race, Lightning races distractedly and soon falls into last place. He is then surprised to discover that Doc, having a change of heart, has taken over as his crew chief and several of his other friends from Radiator Springs are helping in the pit. Inspired and recalling tricks he learned from Doc and his friends, Lightning quickly emerges to lead the race in the final lap, but at the last minute, Chick, refusing to lose to The King again, sideswipes and sends The King into a dangerous crash. Seeing this on the jumbotron and recalling Doc's fate, Lightning stops just short of the finish line, allowing Chick to win, and drives back to push The King over the finish line and help him finish his last race. As a result, the angered crowd and media condemn Chick's victory while also praising Lightning's sportsmanship. Lightning is offered the Dinoco sponsorship, but declines and insists on staying with Rust-Eze out of loyalty for their past support. Back at Radiator Springs, Lightning reunites with Sally and announces that he will be setting up his racing headquarters there, putting Radiator Springs back on the map.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], [[List of Cars characters|Minny and Van]], a couple who were trying to find the Interstate, are shown lost in a desert.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{see also|List of Cars characters}}\n* [[Owen Wilson]] as [[Lightning McQueen]], described by John Lasseter in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' as \"A hybrid between a stock car and a more curvaceous [[24 Hours of Le Mans#Cars|Le Mans endurance]] racer\".<ref name=\"lagreasegeek\">{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/jun/04/entertainment/ca-cars4 |title=A grease geek will guide you: ''Cars'' decoded |author=Dan Neil |work=Los Angeles Times |date=June 4, 2006 |accessdate=November 1, 2006}}</ref>\n* [[Paul Newman]] as [[Doc Hudson]], a 1951 [[Hudson Hornet]] who is later revealed to be the [[Fabulous Hudson Hornet]] and is Newman's last non-documentary role before retirement in 2007 and death in 2008.\n* [[Bonnie Hunt]] as [[Sally Carrera]], a 2002 [[Porsche 996|996-series]] [[Porsche 911]] Carrera.\n* [[Larry the Cable Guy]] as [[Mater (Cars)|Mater]], a 1951 [[International Harvester]] L-170 \"boom\" truck<ref>{{cite book |author=Michael Wallis |author2=Suzanne Fitzgerald Wallis |title=The Art of Cars |year=2006 |publisher=Chronicle Books |page=4 |quote=In Galena, Kansas, we found a lonely old tow truck that most folks would pass by without a second glance.

In one vein, I have Disney blood, and in the other, there's motor oil. The notion of combining these two great passions in my life\u2014cars and animation\u2014was irresistible. When Joe (Ranft) and I first started talking about this film in 1998, we knew we wanted to do something with cars as characters. Around that same time, we watched a documentary called 'Divided Highways,' which dealt with the interstate highway and how it affected the small towns along the way. We were so moved by it and began thinking about what it must have been like in these small towns that got bypassed. That's when we started really researching Route 66, but we still hadn't quite figured out what the story for the film was going to be. I used to travel that highway with my family as a child when we visited our family in St. Louis.\"<ref name=\"adisney1\"/>\n\nYears later in 2013, Klubien said the film was both his best and most bitter experience because he was fired before it premiered and because he feels Lasseter wrote him out of the story of how the film got made.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Amazing Double Life of Jorgen Klubien |url=http://flipanimation.blogspot.jp/2013/10/the-amazing-double-life-of-jorgen.html |website=FLIP |accessdate=July 3, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Animation===\n[[File:carsanimation.png|thumb|A rendered frame from the development of the film.]]\nFor the cars themselves, Lasseter also visited the design studios of the Big Three Detroit automakers, particularly J Mays of Ford Motor Company.<ref name=\"adisney1\">{{cite web |url=http://adisney.go.com/disneypictures/cars/us/bios/CARSProdNotes.pdf |title=Cars Production Information |date=May 5, 2006 |accessdate=June 2, 2009 |format=PDF}}</ref> Lasseter learned how real cars were designed.<ref name=\"adisney1\"/>\n\nIn 2006, Lasseter spoke about how they worked hard to make the animation believable, saying: \"It took many months of trial and error, and practicing test animation, to figure out how each car moves and how their world works. Our supervising animators, Doug Sweetland and Scott Clark, and the directing animators, Bobby Podesta and James Ford Murphy, did an amazing job working with the animation team to determine the unique movements for each character based on its age and the type of car it was. Some cars are like sports cars and they're much tighter in their suspension. Others are older '50s cars that are a lot looser and have more bounce to them. We wanted to get that authenticity in there but also to make sure each car had a unique personality. We also wanted each animator to be able to put some of themself in the character and give it their own spin. Every day in dailies, it was so much fun because we would see things that we had never seen in our lives. The world of cars came alive in a believable and unexpected way.\"<ref name=\"adisney1\"/>\n\nUnlike most anthropomorphic cars, the eyes of the cars in this film were placed on the windshield (which resembles the [[Tonka]] Talking Trucks, the characters from [[Tex Avery]]'s ''One Cab's Family'' short and Disney's own ''[[Susie the Little Blue Coupe]]''), rather than within the headlights.<ref name=\"adisney1\"/> According to [[production designer]] Bob Pauley, \"From the very beginning of this project, [[John Lasseter]] had it in his mind to have the eyes be in the windshield. For one thing, it separates our characters from the more common approach where you have little cartoon eyes in the headlights. For another, he thought that having the eyes down near the mouth at the front end of the car feels more like a snake. With the eyes set in the windshield, the point of view is more human-like, and made it feel like the whole car could be involved in the animation of the character.<ref name=\"adisney1\"/> This decision was heavily criticized by automotive blog [[Jalopnik]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jalopnik.com/5870976/how-pixar-screwed-up-cartoon-cars-for-a-generation-of-kids |title=How Pixar screwed up cartoon cars for a generation of kids |publisher=Jalopnik.com |accessdate=June 10, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, supervising animator on the film Scott Clark, spoke about the challenges of animating car characters, saying: \"Getting a full range of performance and emotion from these characters and making them still seem like cars was a tough assignment, but that's what animation does best. You use your imagination, and you make the movements and gestures fit with the design. Our car characters may not have arms and legs, but we can lean the tires in or out to suggest hands opening up or closing in. We can use steering to point a certain direction. We also designed a special eyelid and an eyebrow for the windshield that lets us communicate an expressiveness that cars don't have.\"<ref name=\"adisney1\"/> Doug Sweetland, who also served as supervising animator, also spoke about the challenges, saying: \"It took a different kind of animator to really be able to interpret the ''Cars'' models, than it did to interpret something like ''[[The Incredibles]]'' models. With ''The Incredibles'', the animator could get reference for the characters by shooting himself and watching the footage. But with ''Cars'', it departs completely from any reference. Yes they're cars, but no car can do what our characters do. It's pure fantasy. It took a lot of trial and error to get them to look right.\"<ref name=\"adisney1\"/>\n\n[[File:John Lasseter 2 cropped 2009.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Lasseter]] co-wrote and directed the film.]]\nLasseter also explained that the film started with pencil and paper designs, saying: \"Truth to materials. Starting with pencil-and-paper designs from production designer Bob Pauley, and continuing through the modeling, articulation, and shading of the characters, and finally into animation, the production team worked hard to have the car characters remain true to their origins.\"<ref name=\"adisney1\"/> Character department manager Jay Ward also explained how they wanted the cars to look as realistic as possible, saying: \"John didn't want the cars to seem clay-like or mushy. He insisted on truth to materials. This was a huge thing for him. He told us that steel needs to feel like steel. Glass should feel like glass. These cars need to feel heavy. They weigh three or four thousand pounds. When they move around, they need to have that feel. They shouldn't appear light or overly bouncy to the point where the audience might see them as rubber toys.\"<ref name=\"adisney1\"/> According to directing animator James Ford Murphy, \"Originally, the car models were built so they could basically do anything. John kept reminding us that these characters are made of metal and they weigh several thousand pounds. They can't stretch. He showed us examples of very loose animation to illustrate what not to do.\"<ref name=\"adisney1\"/>\n\nCharacter shading supervisor on the film Thomas Jordan explained that chrome and car paint were the main challenges on the film, saying: \"Chrome and car paint were our two main challenges on this film. We started out by learning as much as we could. At the local body shop, we watched them paint a car, and we saw the way they mixed the paint and applied the various coats. We tried to dissect what goes into the real paint and recreated it in the computer. We figured out that we needed a base paint, which is where the color comes from, and the clearcoat, which provides the reflection. We were then able to add in things like metallic flake to give it a glittery sparkle, a pearlescent quality that might change color depending on the angle, and even a layer of pin-striping for characters like Ramone.\"<ref name=\"adisney1\"/> Supervising technical director on the film Eben Ostby explained that the biggest challenge for the technical team was creating the metallic and painted surfaces of the car characters, and the reflections that those surfaces generate, saying: \"Given that the stars of our film are made of metal, John had a real desire to see realistic reflections, and more beautiful lighting than we\u2019ve seen in any of our previous films. In the past, we\u2019ve mostly used environment maps and other matte-based technology to cheat reflections, but for ''Cars'' we added a ray-tracing capability to our existing Renderman program to raise the bar for Pixar.\"<ref name=\"adisney1\"/>\n\nRendering lead Jessica McMackin spoke about the use of ray tracing on the film, saying: \"In addition to creating accurate reflections, we used ray tracing to achieve other effects. We were able to use this approach to create accurate shadows, like when there are multiple light sources and you want to get a feathering of shadows at the edges. Or occlusion, which is the absence of ambient light between two surfaces, like a crease in a shirt. A fourth use is irradiance. An example of this would be if you had a piece of red paper and held it up to a white wall, the light would be colored by the paper and cast a red glow on the wall.\"<ref name=\"adisney1\"/> Character supervisor Tim Milliron explained that the film uses a ground\u2013locking system that kept the cars firmly planted on the road, saying: \"The ground-locking system is one of the things I\u2019m most proud of on this film. In the past, characters have never known about their environment in any way. A simulation pass was required if you wanted to make something like that happen. On ''Cars'', this system is built into the models themselves, and as you move the car around, the vehicle sticks to the ground. It was one of those things that we do at Pixar where we knew going in that it had to be done, but we had no idea how to do it.\"<ref name=\"adisney1\"/>\n\nTechnical director Lisa Forsell explained that to enhance the richness and beauty of the desert landscapes surrounding Radiator Springs, the filmmakers created a department responsible for matte paintings and sky flats, saying: \"Digital matte paintings are a way to get a lot of visual complexity without necessarily having to build complex geometry, and write complex shaders. We spent a lot time working on the clouds and their different formations. They tend to be on several layers and they move relative to each other. The clouds do in fact have some character and personality. The notion was that just as people see themselves in the clouds, cars see various car-shaped clouds. It\u2019s subtle, but there are definitely some that are shaped like a sedan. And if you look closely, you\u2019ll see some that look like tire treads. The fact that so much attention is put on the skies speaks to the visual level of the film. Is there a story point? Not really. There is no pixel on the screen that does not have an extraordinary level of scrutiny and care applied to it. There is nothing that is just throw-away.\"<ref name=\"adisney1\"/>\n\nComputers used in the development of the film were four times faster than those used in ''[[The Incredibles]]'' and 1,000 times faster than those used in ''[[Toy Story]]''. To build the cars, the animators used computer platforms similar to those used in the design of real-world automobiles.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/21/automobiles/21AUTO.html |title=Pixar's ''Cars'' Got Its Kicks on Route 66 |accessdate=April 11, 2009 |author=Phil Patton |date=May 21, 2006 |work=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Main|Cars (soundtrack)}}\nThe [[Cars (soundtrack)|''Cars'' soundtrack]] was released by [[Walt Disney Records]] on June 6, 2006.<ref name=\"allmusic1\">{{cite web |author=Heather Phares |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/cars-original-soundtrack-mw0000768029 |title=Cars [Original Soundtrack&#93; - Original Soundtrack &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |website=AllMusic |date=June 6, 2006 |accessdate=January 7, 2014}}</ref> Nine tracks on the soundtrack are by popular artists, while the remaining eleven are score cues by [[Randy Newman]].<ref name=\"allmusic1\"/> It has two versions of the classic [[Bobby Troup]] jazz standard \"[[Route 66 (song)|Route 66]]\" (popularized by [[Nat King Cole]]), one by [[Chuck Berry]] and a new version recorded specifically for the film's credits performed by [[John Mayer (musician)|John Mayer]].<ref name=\"allmusic1\"/> [[Brad Paisley]] contributed two of the nine tracks to the album, one being \"Find Yourself\" used for the end credits.<ref name=\"allmusic1\"/>\n\n==Release==\n''Cars'' was originally going to be released on November 4, 2005, but on December 7, 2004, its release date was moved to June 9, 2006.<ref name=\"BBCJobs\">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4078711.stm |title=Pixar-Disney delay Cars release |work=BBC News |date=December 8, 2004 |accessdate=June 30, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190206174829/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4078711.stm |archivedate=February 6, 2019}}</ref> Analysts looked at the release date change as a sign from Pixar that they were preparing for the pending end of the Disney distribution contract by either preparing non-Disney materials to present to other studios or they were buying time to see what happened with [[Michael Eisner]]'s situation at Disney.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/dec2004/nf2004129_4222_db035.htm |title=Steve Jobs's Sharp Turn with Cars |work=Business Week |date=December 9, 2004 |accessdate=June 30, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311001731/http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/dec2004/nf2004129_4222_db035.htm |archivedate=March 11, 2007}}</ref>  When Pixar's chief executive [[Steve Jobs]] made the release date announcement, he stated that the reasoning was due to wanting to put all Pixar films on a summer release schedule with DVD sales occurring during the holiday shopping season.<ref name=\"BBCJobs\" />\n\n===Home media===\n''Cars'' was released on DVD, in [[Aspect ratio (image)|wide- and full-screen]] editions, on November 7, 2006 in the United States and Canada.

projects from large blockbusters to small indie collaborations. Many of these individuals are also creating other artistic content such as comics, board games, machinima, and fine art.\n\nMany Indigenous people working in video games are running their own studios or solo practices such as [http://www.achimogames.ca Achimostawinan Games], an Indigenous game studio owned and operated by [[M\u00e9tis]] video game designer Meagan Byrne. (Meagan is best known for her work [https://byrneout.itch.io/wanisinowin-lost Wanisinowin | Lost]). Some have been working in the [[Video game industry]] for years, such as [[Allen Turner (game designer)]] or [[John Romero]] ([[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]). Some work as both creator and academic, such as game developer and scholar [[Elizabeth LaPens\u00e9e]] (Anishinaabe and M\u00e9tis), who has had a role in creating games such as When Rivers Were Trails, [https://www.thunderbirdstrike.com/ Thunderbird Strike], [http://www.honourwater.com/about Honour Water] and [http://www.digiart21.org/art/invaders Invaders], which merge interactive media and Indigenous ways of knowing.\n\n* Allen Turner ([[Stubbs the Zombie]], [[Hail to the Chimp]], [[Guilty Party (video game)|Disney's Guilty Party]], Marvel XP)<ref name=\"linkedin.com\"/>\n* Ashlee Bird, creator of [https://abird.itch.io/one-small-step One Small Step] and [https://abird.itch.io/imaginenative-gallery-submission Full of Birds]\n* Darrick Glen Baxter, founder of Ogoki (Multiple Language Apps, Alien Bug Attack, Babaamosedaa Let's Go for a Walk, Brokenhead Bingo, Elfs Defence, Rez Bomb, Spike Flyer, Spring Shoes Jump Better)<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ogokilearning.com/about-ogoki-learning-systems-learning-president-bio/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-12-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222131248/http://www.ogokilearning.com/about-ogoki-learning-systems-learning-president-bio/ |archive-date=2015-12-22 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n* [[Elizabeth LaPens\u00e9e]] (When Rivers Were Trails, Thunderbird Strike, Invaders, Ninagamomin ji-nanaandawi'iwe, Survivance)<ref name=\"elizabethlapensee.com\"/>  \n* Ernest Webb ([[Papo & Yo]], Spirits of Spring)<ref>http://www.nationnews.ca/moving-in-a-new-direction/</ref>\n* Jamie Tucker ([[Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime]])<ref>https://tworowtimes.com/art-and-culture/first-nations-comics-and-video-games-draw-a-crowd/</ref>\n*[https://www.jesseholt.com/ Jesse Holt] Audio Designer and Composer previous in-house at DoubleDown Interactive, [[GameHouse]], Absolute Hero Games, Presence Labs, and more.\n* [[John Romero]] ([[Wolfenstein 3D]], [[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]], [[Quake (video game)|Quake]])<ref name=\"usgamer\">http://www.usgamer.net/articles/more-than-shamans-and-savages-american-indians-and-game-development</ref> \n* Manuel Marcano ([[BioShock]], [[The Darkness (video game)|The Darkness]], [[Max Payne 3]], Treachery in Beatdown City)<ref name=\"usgamer\"/>\n* Maru Nihoniho, owner of Metia Interactive (Cube)<ref>http://www.maorifuturemakers.com/maru-nihoniho-games-developer</ref>\n* Maize Longboat, creator of [https://maizelongboat.itch.io/terra-nova Terra/Nova]\n* Meagan Byrne, owner of [http://www.achimogames.ca Achimostawinan Games] and original developer of the [[imagineNATIVE]] iNDigital Space.
