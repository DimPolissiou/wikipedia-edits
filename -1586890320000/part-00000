It has broad and effective powers of [[judicial review in Austria|judicial review]].\n\nStructurally, the Austrian judiciary is divided into general courts ({{lang|de|ordentliche Gerichte}}) and courts of public law ({{lang|de|Gerichte \u00f6ffentlichen Rechts}}).\nThe general courts handle [[lawsuit|civil]] and criminal trials as well as non-adversary proceedings such as inheritance cases or legal guardianship matters.\nThe courts of public law supervise the other two branches of government: the administrative court system reviews the legality of administrative acts; the [[Constitutional Court (Austria)|Constitutional Court]] adjudicates on complaints regarding the constitutionality of statutes, the legality of ordinances, and the conduct of elected officials and political appointees in office.\n\nIn addition to the court system proper, the judicial arm of Austrian state power includes the state prosecution service ({{lang|de|Staatsanwaltschaft}}), the prisons ({{lang|de|Justizanstalten}}) and the [[Justizwache|correctional officers' corps]] ({{lang|de|Justizwache}}). Remand prisons for pre-trial detention or other types of non-correctional custody ({{lang|de|Polizeianhaltezentren}}) belong to the [[executive (government)|executive branch]].\nThe judiciary is assisted by the [[Ministry of Justice (Austria)|Ministry of Justice]] ({{lang|de|Justizministerium}}), a cabinet-level division of the national executive.\n\n{{toclimit|limit=3}}\n\n== Organization ==\n\nThe administration of justice in [[Austria]] is the sole responsibility of the federal government. Judges and prosecutors are recruited, trained, and employed by the Republic; courts hand down verdicts in the name of the Republic ({{lang|de|im Namen der Republik}}). There is no such thing, for example, as an Austrian county court.{{sfnaut|B-VG||Art. 82|Berka|2016|273|\u00d6hlinger|2007|269}}\n\nThe court system has two branches:\n* general courts ({{lang|de|ordentliche Gerichte}}) try criminal cases and (most) civil cases;{{efn|Some authors, mostly Austrians, translate \"{{lang|de|ordentliche Gerichte}}\" as \"ordinary courts\". Among authors who speak English as a first language, \"general courts\" predominates.}}\n* courts of public law ({{lang|de|Gerichte \u00f6ffentlichten Rechts}}) try (some of the) civil cases in which the respondent is a government authority:{{efn|Sometimes translated as \"public courts\"; see above.}}\n**the [[Constitutional Court (Austria)|Constitutional Court]] ({{lang|de|Verfassungsgerichtshof}}) tries liability claims against the republic, a province, or a municipality and exercises [[judicial review]] of legislation;\n**a system of administrative courts ({{lang|de|Verwaltungsgerichte}}) exercises judicial review of administrative actions.\n\nJudges are [[judicial independence|independent]]. Appointments are for life; judges cannot be removed or reassigned without their consent. In courts with more than one judge \u2212 which is essentially all of them \u2212 there has to be a fixed and specific apportionment of responsibilities ({{lang|de|feste Gesch\u00e4ftseinteilung}}) to prevent the government from influencing outcomes by hand-picking a judge sympathetic to its perspective.{{sfnaut|B-VG||Art. 87\u221288|Berka|2016|269\u2212271|\u00d6hlinger|2007|269\u2212270}}\nFor example, if a litigant files for divorce in a court with multiple judges handling divorce cases, the first letter of their last name decides which judge they are assigned.{{sfnaut|Berka|2016|270}}\n\nJudges presiding over trials are professionals. In order to become eligible for appointment to a bench, a prospective judge needs to have a master's degree or equivalent in Austrian law, undergo four years of post-graduate training, and pass an exam. The training includes theoretical instruction and internship-type practical work in an actual courthouse. Appointments to benches are made by the [[President of Austria|president]], although the president can and does delegate most of this responsibility to the [[Ministry of Justice (Austria)|minister of justice]]. Nominations come from within the judiciary; panels of judges suggest candidates for benches with vacancies.{{sfnaut|B-VG||Art.86|\u00d6hlinger|2007|270}}\n\nThere is no [[military justice]] in peacetime; members of the military are tried by the regular court system.{{sfnaut|B-VG||Art. 84|\u00d6hlinger|2007|269}}\n\n== Procedure ==\n\n[[File:Landesgericht Wels.JPG|thumb|right|The seat of the [[Wels]] regional court]]\nTrials are oral and public.{{sfnaut|B-VG||Art. 90 (1)|Berka|2016|271\u2212272, 560\u2212561|\u00d6hlinger|2007|272, 439\u2212433}}\n\nCivil trials are [[adversarial system|adversarial trials]] ({{lang|de|streitige Verfahren}}).\nThe court evaluates evidence brought before it by the parties to the trial but makes no attempt to uncover any additional evidence or otherwise investigate the matter itself.\nCriminal trials are [[inquisitorial system|inquisitorial trials]] ({{lang|de|Anklageverfahren}}).{{efn|In [[German language|German]], {{lang|de|inquisitorisches Verfahren}} is only used to denote inquisitorial trials in which judge and prosecutor are the same person, or the same panel. An inquisitorial trial in which judge and prosecution are separate entities is called an {{lang|de|Anklageverfahren}}, literally \"prosecutorial trial\". There has been no {{lang|de|inquisitorisches Verfahren}} in Austria since the 1870s.}}{{sfnaut|B-VG||Art. 90 (2)|Berka|2016|272|\u00d6hlinger|2007|272}}\nThe court is actively involved, questioning witnesses brought forward by the parties to the trials, summoning expert witnesses on its own initiative, and generally attempting to determine the truth.\nMost trials are bench trials, although the bench will often be a panel including one or more [[lay judge]]s ({{lang|de|Sch\u00f6ffen}}). Criminal defendants accused of political transgressions or of serious crimes with severe penalties have a right to trial by jury.{{sfnaut|B-VG||Art. 91|Berka|2016|274|\u00d6hlinger|2007|270}}\n\nPursuant to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], which has been adopted into the Austrian constitution, but also to Austrian constitutional law preceding it, criminal defendants are protected by the set of procedural guarantees typical for modern [[liberal democracy|liberal democracies]]. Among other things, defendants\n* are [[presumption of innocence|presumed innocent until proven guilty]];{{sfnaut|StPO||\u00a78, \u00a714|Berka|2016|272, 563\u2212564|\u00d6hlinger|2007|434}}\n* have the right to a [[speedy trial]];{{sfnaut|StPO||\u00a79|Berka|2016|561\u2212562|\u00d6hlinger|2007|432}}\n* cannot be tried [[trial in absentia|in absentia]];{{sfnaut|StPO||\u00a76|\u00d6hlinger|2007|429\u2212430}}\n* cannot be forced to incriminate themselves;{{sfnaut|StPO||\u00a77|Berka|2016|272, 564\u2212565}}\n* cannot be tried for transgressions that are not specifically defined to be criminal offenses by statutory law, or that {{em|were}} not specifically defined to be criminal offenses by statutory law {{em|at the time they were committed}} (\"[[nulla poena sine lege]]\");{{sfnaut|Berka|2016|566|\u00d6hlinger|2007|425}}\n* cannot be prosecuted twice for the same crime, alleged or actual (\"[[non bis in idem]]\");{{sfnaut|StPO||\u00a717|Berka|2016|566\u2212568|\u00d6hlinger|2007|438\u2212439}}\n* have a right to an appeal.{{sfnaut|Berka|2016|568\u2212569|\u00d6hlinger|2007|437}}\n\nThe right to an appeal is taken seriously. Any party to any trial before a general court can file an appeal on facts and law ({{lang|de|Berufung}}).{{sfnaut|StPO||\u00a7280|ZPO||\u00a7461}}\nIf the case is a civil case, the appellate court first checks whether the trial court has committed procedural errors; if yes, it orders a retrial, sending the case back to the trial court.{{sfnaut|ZPO||\u00a7477, \u00a7494, \u00a7496}}\nIf no, or if the case is criminal, the appellate court conducts what is essentially a retrial itself \u2212 the appellate trial does not merely review questions of law but also questions of fact, assessing evidence and questioning witnesses.{{sfnaut|ZPO||\u00a7482, \u00a7484}}\n\nIn addition to the appeal on facts and law against the verdict of the trial court, an appeal at law ({{lang|de|Revision}} in civil trials, {{lang|de|Nichtigkeitsbeschwerde}} in criminal cases) can be filed against the verdict of the appellate court.{{sfnaut|StPO||\u00a7\u00a7502-505|ZPO||\u00a7280}}\nIn criminal cases, appeals at law that are not obviously frivolous are also handled in public hearings.{{sfnaut|StPO||\u00a7\u00a7285c-285d, \u00a7286}} A successful appeal at law not just overturns but completely erases the verdict of the appellate court, sending the case down the ladder again.\nVerdicts of trial courts \u2212 although not of appellate courts \u2212 that result from the trial court's application of an unconstitutional statute or an illegal ordinance can additionally be fought with extraordinary appeals at law to the Constitutional Court.\n\n<!-- mostly happy with everything from top to here -->\n\n== General courts ==\n\nThe hierarchy of general courts has four levels: district, regional, higher regional, and supreme.{{sfnaut|StPO||\u00a729}}\n\nFor most cases, [[original jurisdiction]] lies with one of the district courts; its decision can be appealed to the relevant regional court. Some cases are first tried before the regional court and can be appealed to the higher regional court. Higher regional courts and the Supreme Court do not have original jurisdiction; they exclusively hear appeals.\n\nOne of the peculiarities of the Austrian judiciary is its strict organizational separation of civil and criminal justice.\nCourts are divided into civil and criminal chambers; judges spend their days trying either civil cases or criminal cases but never both.\nIn [[Vienna]] and in [[Graz]] \u2212 the country's two largest cities by a wide margin \u2212 the two chambers of the regional court are actually two completely separate courts, housed in separate buildings. In Vienna, there is a third regional court for trials at mercantile law ({{lang|de|Handelsgericht}}) and a fourth regional court for cases involving employment and social assistance law ({{lang|de|Arbeits- und Sozialgericht}}). Normally, original jurisdiction over disputes in these areas of law would lie with the civil regional court. As an additional special case, the higher regional court in Vienna has original jurisdiction over antitrust cases.\n\n=== District courts ===\n\nThere are currently 115 district courts ({{lang|de|Bezirksgerichte}}).\nMost judicial districts are coextensive with one of the country's 94 [[District (Austria)|administrative districts]], although there are exceptions.\nSome of the larger administrative districts are partitioned into two of ore judicial districts. The extreme case is the [[Vienna|City of Vienna]], home to no fewer than 12 separate district courts.\nIn some cases, a district court serving a city also serves part of the surrounding suburbs. In others, two or three very small administrative districts are lumped together into a single judicial zone.\n\nDistrict courts are responsible for\n* civil trials ({{lang|de|Zivilverfahren}}) involving matrimonial and family matters, real estate rental or lease matters, real estate boundary or easement disputes, or trespass to land;\n* most simple debt collection, foreclosure, and bankruptcy matters;\n* other civil trials with the amount in dispute not exceeding EUR 15,000, excepting employment and social assistance disputes;\n* most criminal trials ({{lang|de|Strafverfahren}}) involving finable offenses or jailable offenses with a jail term of no more than one year;{{sfnaut|StPO||\u00a730 (1)}}\n* most non-adversary matters ({{lang|de|Au\u00dferstreitsachen}}), for example probate proceedings, adoptions, declarations of death in absentia, or invalidation of lost securities certificates;\n* most adversary non-trial matters ({{lang|de|streitige Au\u00dferstreitsachen}}), including but not limited to child custody disputes, child maintenance and visitation rights disputes, appointments of legal guardians for senile elders or the mentally ill, or expropriation proceedings;\n* maintaining the land register.\n\nTrials before the district court are bench trials decided by a single judge ({{lang|de|Bezirksrichter}}).{{sfnaut|StPO||\u00a730 (2)}} Non-adversary proceedings, debt collection, foreclosure, bankruptcy, and land register matters can also be decided by a judiciary clerk ({{lang|de|Rechtspfleger}}).\n\nWhile there are permanent district judges, there are no district {{em|attorneys}}. Criminal trials are prosecuted by a state attorney ({{lang|de|Staatsanwalt}}) attached to the relevant regional court. In minor cases, the public prosecutor can assign a district prosecutor ({{lang|de|Bezirksanwalt}}) to substitute for them. The district prosecutor is not necessarily an attorney, however, and cannot act on their own initiative or authority.{{sfnaut|StPO||\u00a720}}\n\n=== Regional courts ===\n[[File:Schillerstrasse 1 Gericht Feldkirch 1.JPG|thumb|right|The seat of the [[Feldkirch, Vorarlberg|Feldkirch]] regional court]]\nThere are 18 regional courts ({{lang|de|Landesgerichte}}) in Austria; their seats are in [[Eisenstadt]], [[Feldkirch, Vorarlberg|Feldkirch]], [[Graz]], [[Innsbruck]], [[Klagenfurt]], [[Korneuburg]], [[Krems an der Donau]], [[Leoben]], [[Linz]], [[Ried im Innkreis]], [[Salzburg]], [[Sankt P\u00f6lten]], [[Steyr]], [[Vienna]], [[Wels]], and [[Wiener Neustadt]]. In Graz and Vienna, the civil and criminal chambers set up as two separate courts, meaning that Graz and Vienna each have a civil regional court ({{lang|de|Landesgericht f\u00fcr Zivilrechtssachen}}) and a criminal regional court ({{lang|de|Landesgericht f\u00fcr Strafrechtssachen}}).\n\nRegional courts are responsible for\n* exercising original jurisdiction over all civil and criminal matters not handled by district courts;\n* hearing appeals on facts and law ({{lang|de|Berufungen}}) against district court decisions;\n* keeping the company register.\n\nIn cases for which the regional court has original jurisdiction, the trial is usually a bench trial decided by a single professional judge,{{sfnaut|StPO||\u00a731 (4)}} but there are several exceptions:\n* Suits at employment law or social assistance law are decided by a panel of three judges, one professional judge ({{lang|de|Berufsrichter}}) and two [[lay judge]]s ({{lang|de|Laienrichter}}). The lay judges are {{em|expert}} lay judges ({{lang|de|fachkundige Laienrichter}}) and are effectively meant to double as court-appointed disinterested expert witnesses.\n* Other civil suits can be tried by three-judge panels upon request of the parties if the amount in dispute exceeds EUR 100,000. In cases at mercantile law, the panel consists of two professional judges and one expert lay judge ({{lang|de|fachm\u00e4nnischer Laienrichter}} here). In other cases, the panel consists of three professional judges.\n* Criminal trials are held before three-judge panels, four-judge panels, or juries in cases of alleged homicide, sexual assault, robbery, certain types of grand larceny or fraud, and in any case where the alleged crime carries a maximum jail term of more than five years. The specifics are somewhat involved; the following is a rough outline:\n** Most of the cases outlined above go before a three-judge panel consisting of one professional judge and two lay judges ({{lang|de|Sch\u00f6ffen}}).{{sfnaut|StPO||\u00a731 (3), \u00a732 (1)}}\n** In cases of alleged manslaughter, aggravated robbery, rape, membership in a terrorist organization, abuse of official authority, or financial crimes causing more than EUR 1,000,000 in damage, a second professional judge is added to the panel.{{sfnaut|StPO||\u00a732 (1a)}}\n** Charges of murder, actual terrorist violence, or armed insurrection are jury trials decided by three professional judges and eight jurors ({{lang|de|Geschworene}}). The same is true for treason, a number of other political crimes, and all other crimes with minimum jail terms of more than five and maximum jail terms of more than ten years.{{sfnaut|StPO||\u00a731 (2)}}\n\nIn criminal trials, some effort is made to prevent panels and juries from being biased or unable to empathize with either defendants or alleged victims. If the crime alleged is a sexual assault or some other violation of a person's sexual integrity serious enough to warrant a panel, then at least one of the judges must belong to the same sex as the alleged victim. If there is a jury, then at least two of the jurors must be of the same sex as the alleged victim.{{sfnaut|StPO||\u00a732 (2)}} If the defendant is juvenile and the alleged crime is serious enough to warrant a panel, then at least one of the judges must be of the same sex as the defendant and at least one of the judges must be a present or former educator or competent social worker. If there is a jury, at least two of the jurors must be of the relevant sex and at least four must have the relevant job experience.{{sfnaut|JGG||\u00a728}}\n\nAppeals of district courts decisions to regional courts are decided by three-judge panels: two professional judges and one expert lay judge in trials at mercantile law, three professional judges in all other civil matters and in all criminal cases.{{sfnaut|StPO||\u00a731 (6)}}\n\nRoutine company register decisions are made by single judges or by judicial clerks.\n\nAttached to every regional court dealing with criminal trials, there is a branch of the state prosecution service ({{lang|de|Staatsanwaltschaft}}) and a [[prison]] ({{lang|de|Justizanstalt}}). Regional courts and regional-level state prosecutors organize and supervise most of the pre-trial work ({{lang|de|Ermittlungsverfahren}}) in Austria, even in cases in which the main court proceedings ({{lang|de|Hauptverfahren}}) are going to take place in a district court. In many ways, the regional courts are the backbone of the Austrian judiciary.\n\n=== Higher regional courts ===\n\nThere are four higher regional courts ({{lang|de|Oberlandesgerichte}}). They are located in [[Graz]], [[Innsbruck]], [[Linz]], and [[Vienna]].\n\nHigher regional courts decide appeals on facts and law ({{lang|de|Berufungen}}) in cases originally tried before regional courts.{{sfnaut|StPO||\u00a733 (1)}}\n\nAs a special case, the higher regional court in Vienna decides antitrust disputes.\n\n<!-- In criminal trials presided over by a single professional judge ({{lang|de|Einzelrichter}}), prosecution or defense can file a regular appeal against the verdict ({{lang|de|Schuldberufung}}). In trials decided by a panel of judges and in jury trials, a regular appeal is only possible against the sentence ({{lang|de|Strafberufung}}). Appeals in point of law and pleas in nullity ({{lang|de|Nichtigkeitsbeschwerden}}) are possible in any case. -->\nTrials before higher regional courts are bench trials decided by panels of either three or five judges: three professional judges and two expert lay judges in employment and social assistance cases, two professional judges and one expert lay judge in all other civil cases, and three professional judges in all criminal trials.{{sfnaut|StPO||\u00a733 (2)}}\n\nEach higher regional court has a chief public prosecutor's office ({{lang|de|Oberstaatsanwaltschaft}}).\n\n=== Supreme Court of Justice ===\n\n[[File:Justizpalast Vienna June 2006 227.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Palace of Justice (Vienna)|Palace of Justice]], seat of the Supreme Court of Justice since 1881]]\n{{Main|Supreme Court of Justice (Austria)}}\n\nThe Supreme Court of Justice ({{lang|de|Oberster Gerichtshof}} or {{lang|de|OGH}}) hears appeals at law ({{lang|de|Revisionen}} in civil trials, {{lang|de|Nichtigkeitsbeschwerden}} in criminal cases) against verdicts of appellate courts.{{sfnaut|StPO||\u00a734|Aufgaben||Oberstes Organ}}\nThe court also deals with service-related complaints by jurists against the judiciary and with disciplinary complaints against jurists; it acts as\nthe trial court in cases involving certain senior judges and prosecutors, as an appeals court in cases involving lower-level judges and prosecutors, attorneys, and notaries.{{sfnaut|RStDG||\u00a782, \u00a790, \u00a7111|Aufgaben||Dienst- und Disziplinargerichtsbarkeit}}\nIn addition to its adjudicative responsibilities, the court is charged with running the Republic's official public law library (the {{lang|de|Zentralbibliothek}}).{{sfnaut|Aufgaben||Zentralbibliothek|Zentralbibliothek||}} On the request of the president of the court or the [[Ministry of Justice|minister of justice]], the court produces appraisals of draft legislation presented to the [[National Council (Austria)|National Council]] by the [[government of Austria|government]].{{sfnaut|OGHG||\u00a711|Aufgaben||Gesetzesbegutachtung}}\n\nThe court does not have a fixed number of justices; it consists of a president, a vice president, and as many additional members as Court and cabinet deem necessary and appropriate.{{sfnaut|B-VG||Art. 92|OGHG||\u00a71 (2)}} As of the early 21st century, there are typically between fifty and sixty judges on the court.{{sfnaut|Foster|2013|38|Graf|2006|76|Stelzer|2011|188}}\nAs of August 2018, there are 61.{{sfnaut|Richterinnen und Richter||}}\n\nThe court is partitioned into 18 panels ({{lang|de|Senate}}) of five members each.{{sfnaut|OGHG||\u00a76|Aufgaben||F\u00fcnfer Senate}}\nOne panel exclusively deals with appeals decisions reached by [[arbitration]] tribunals; another panel hears to appeals to antitrust verdicts handed down by the Vienna higher regional court, which has specialist [[exclusive jurisdiction]] over all Austrian antitrust cases. A third panel handles disciplinary proceedings and other disputes internal to the judiciary. Of the remaining fifteen panels, ten deal with civil cases and five with criminal trials.{{sfnaut|Gesch\u00e4ftsverteilung||}}\n\nThe responsibility for appointing justices is vested in the [[President of Austria|president]], but the president can and usually does delegate this task to the [[Ministry of Justice (Austria)|minister of justice]].{{sfnaut|B-VG||Art. 86 (1)}} The court maintains a special personnel committee ([[German language|German]]: {{lang|de|Personalsenat}}) that provides the minister with a shortlist of three candidates in the event of a vacancy.{{sfnaut|B-VG||Art. 86 (2)|RStDG||\u00a725, \u00a732, \u00a733}} In theory, the minister may appoint any Austrian legally qualified to sit the bench and not excluded by the constitution's rudimentary incompatibility provisions. In practice, the minister dependably picks one of the three candidates nominated by the court.{{sfnaut|Graf|2006|76}}\n\nThe Supreme Court of Justice convenes in the [[Palace of Justice, Vienna|Palace of Justice]] in [[Vienna]].\n<!-- The current president of the court, appointed in July 2018, is [[Elisabeth Lovrek]]. -->\n\n== Courts of public law ==\n\nThe Austrian model of [[separation of powers]] forbids the administrative and judicial branches of government from interfering with each other. This peculiarity, established during the neo-absolutist years of the Habsburg monarchy, originally meant that subjects could not take bureaucrats to court or otherwise petition the courts to review the legality of administrative acts. The [[Federal Constitutional Law (Austrian act)|Constitution of 1920]] fixes this problem by establishing the Administrative Court and the Constitutional Court, two tribunals that cut across the division. Pointedly called {{lang|de|Gerichtsh\u00f6fe}} instead of simply {{lang|de|Gerichte}}, the two tribunals are staffed by lawyer judges and generally behave like courts without technically {{em|being}} courts. The terminology used by most modern English-language literature makes the distinction difficult to see; it remains salient in German texts.\n\nBroadly speaking, the administrative court system reviews administrative acts, the Constitutional Court reviews legislative acts and judicial demarcation conflicts.\n\n=== Administrative court system ===\n\n{{Main|Supreme Administrative Court (Austria)}}\n\n=== Constitutional Court ===\n\n[[File:Kunstforum Vienna June 2006 069.jpg|thumb|right|The seat of the Constitutional Court]]\n{{Main|Constitutional Court (Austria)}}\n\nThe Constitutional Court ({{lang|de|Verfassungsgerichtshof}} or {{lang|de|VfGH}}) adjudicates on\n* liability claims against Austria, its provinces, and its municipalities;{{sfnaut|B-VG||Art. 137|\u00d6hlinger|2007|445\u2212446}}\n* demarcation conflicts between courts, between courts and the administration, and between national and regional governments;{{sfnaut|B-VG||Art. 138|\u00d6hlinger|2007|446\u2212449}}\n* the constitutionality of [[statute]]s and the legality of ordinances and other [[primary and secondary legislation|secondary legislation]];{{sfnaut|B-VG||Art. 139\u2212140|\u00d6hlinger|2007|449\u2212467}}\n* the legality of [[treaty|international treaties]];{{sfnaut|B-VG||Art. 140a|\u00d6hlinger|2007|468}}\n* election complaints;{{sfnaut|B-VG||Art. 141|\u00d6hlinger|2007|469\u2212473}}\n* accusations of misconduct in office against certain elected officials and political appointees;{{sfnaut|B-VG||Art. 142\u2212143|\u00d6hlinger|2007|473\u2212474}}\n* complaints alleging violations of constitutional rights or the [[rule of law]] by the executive branch.{{sfnaut|B-VG||Art. 144}}\n\nThe Constitutional Court is the only court in Austria with the power of [[judicial review]] of legislation.\nThe Austrian method of vesting all power to strike legislation in a single specialist court is called the {{em|centralized}} system of judicial review.\n{{sfnaut|\u00d6hlinger|2007|442, 450}} Because Austria was the first country to adopt this approach when [[Hans Kelsen]] created the Constitutional Court in its modern form with the 1920 [[Federal Constitutional Law (Austrian act)|Kelsen constitution]], the approach is sometimes also called the {{em|Austrian}} system.{{sfnaut|Lachmayer|2017|1p=75|}}\nBecause the approach has since spread to [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], and [[Belgium]], some people call it the {{em|European}} approach.{{sfnaut|Cappelatti|1970|46|Lijphart|1999|224\u2212225}}\n\nLegislation can be challenged before the Constitutional Court by any private person, natural or other.

If the administrative court agrees with the complainant, it overrules the administration. If the administrative court does not, the complainant can escalate the matter to the Constitutional Court. If the Constitutional Court agrees with the complainant, it overrules the administrative court, prompting a retrial; it thus potentially also overrules the administration.{{sfnaut|B-VG||Art. 144|Berka|2016|334, 346\u2212350}}\n\nUnlike the [[Supreme Court of Justice (Austria)|Supreme Court of Justice]] and the [[Supreme Administrative Court (Austria)|Supreme Administrative Court]], the Constitutional Court is not a [[appellate court|court of appeals]]. It only hears cases it has [[original jurisdiction]] over, although the way Austria uses general and administrative courts to vet complaints about unconstitutional legislation and other constitutional rights infringements does present something of an edge case.\n\nThe Constitutional Court consists of fourteen members and six substitute members, appointed by the [[President of Austria|president]] on nomination of the cabinet, the [[National Council (Austria)|National Council]], and the [[Federal Council (Austria)|Federal Council]].{{sfnaut|B-VG||Art. 147|Lachmayer|2017|85\u221286|\u00d6hlinger|2007|222, 442}}\n\nIn theory, trials before the Constitutional Court are oral, public, and decided by the full plenum.{{sfnaut|VfGG||\u00a7\u00a719\u221226}}\nIn practice, oral argument and true plenary sessions have become rare because workload is heavy and there are broad exceptions to these general rules; most cases today are decided behind closed doors by panels of either nine or five members.

While the judge is tasked with actively searching for the truth as opposed to merely refereeing, however, judge and prosecutor are separate entities.

Regional and higher courts have state attorneys' offices attached to them; the state attorneys working at the regional court level are the backbone of the service. Trials before district courts are usually handled through assistants and proxies. (\u00a729 GVG, \u00a7\u00a751\u221260 StPO)\n* Appeals are limited. Verdicts in civil cases can be appealed up only once; verdicts in criminal cases can be appealed up twice.

(\u00a72 GVG, \u00a7\u00a7352\u2212390 StPO)\n\nThe main differences between the court system of the March Constitution and the court system as it exists today are the district collegiate courts, since abolished, the comparatively wide purview of the state attorneys, since narrowed, and the fact that there is no [[judicial review]]. The [[separation of powers]] between judiciary and executive was complete; courts could not overrule the bureaucracy just as the bureaucracy could not overrule the courts. The also was no mechanism for courts to squash unconstitutional legislation. The need for a judicial review of laws was simply not felt at the time. In modern Austria, the main seat of power ({{lang|de|Machtzentrum}}) is the legislature and the Constitutional Court is the monitoring authority acting as a check on it. In the philosophical framework of 19th-century Austria, the imperial court was the main seat of power and {{em|the legislature}} was meant to be the monitoring authority.{{sfnaut|Kelsen|1925|256\u2212257|Pernthaler|1989|42}}\n\n=== Return to absolutism ===\n\n[[File:Franzjosef.jpg|thumb|right|Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] spent much of his early reign trying to reassert unqualified sovereignty.]]\nSince the March Constitution was {{em|decreed}} ({{lang|de|oktroyiert}}) by the crown as opposed to enacted by the people or agreed upon by the empire's constituent crown lands, Franz Joseph felt at liberty to walk back on his promises as soon as he had regained a firm grip on his subjects. The Constitution ({{lang|de|Verfassung}}) was abrogated in 1852 and replaced with a number of \"constitutional principles\" ({{lang|de|Verfassungsgrunds\u00e4tze}}) that sounded vaguely progressive but did not actually bind the ruling house to any real degree. Franz Joseph was trying to return to absolutist rule.{{sfnaut|Brauneder|2009|134|Hoke|1996|359\u2212360}}\n\nJury trials were abolished.\nA complete rewrite of the Penal Procedure Code in 1853 reintroduced old-style inquisitorial trials. Judges lost their independence. State attorneys continued to exist but lost most of their responsibilities; they were essentially reduced to their function as public prosecutors, and comparatively powerless ones at that. Trials were no longer public. Trials before higher regional courts and the supreme court were no longer oral. On the district level, the [[separation of powers]] was abandoned, at least on paper. District courts were merged into district administrative offices, although in practice district judges continued to operate much as they had before.{{sfnaut|Brauneder|2009|145\u2212146|Hoke|1996|361, 363\u2212364}}\n\nThe return to absolutism ultimately failed. The continuing rise of [[civic nationalism]] and continuing demands by Austria's [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] and [[Slavs|Slavic]] subjects for material autonomy, exacerbated by a series of diplomatic setbacks, kept eroding the cohesion of the empire and the personal authority of the Emperor. By 1861, Franz Joseph was forced to grant a third constitution. Following his defeat in the [[Austro-Prussian War]] in 1866, he was forced to give up for good on his desire to remain the sole sovereign and font of law. In the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]], the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] received near-complete independence. Shortly thereafter, the remainder of the empire received the [[December Constitution]], a fourth and final set of fundamental laws that the Emperor would no longer be able to unilaterally scrap.{{sfnaut|Brauneder|2009|154\u2212155|Hoke|1996|370\u2212371, 385\u2212387}}\n\n=== December Constitution ===\n\nAs far as civil and criminal jurisprudence was concerned, the December Constitution mostly just resurrected the principles originally stipulated in 1849. Judges regained their autonomy and independence, although state attorneys remained limited to their narrow role as prosecutors. The constitution restored full separation of powers, including on the district level. District courts, accordingly, were detached from district administrative offices again. District collegiate courts, on the other hand, were not; they were simply abandoned.{{sfnaut|Brauneder|2009|174\u2212175|Hoke|1996|397\u2212400}}\n\nThe system of general courts now had the same four rungs it still has today:\n* District courts ({{lang|de|Bezirksgerichte}});\n* Regional courts (now called {{lang|de|Kreisgerichte}} instead of {{lang|de|Landesgerichte}});\n* Higher regional courts (still called {{lang|de|Oberlandesgerichte}});\n* Supreme Court ({{lang|de|Oberster Gerichts- und Kassationshof}}).\n\nThe December Constitution did more than merely revive suspended institutions, however. One of its parts, the Basic Law on the General Rights of Nationals ({{lang|de|Staatsgrundgesetz \u00fcber die allgemeinen Rechte der Staatsb\u00fcrger}}) was a second [[bill of rights]] that was a significant improvement over its 1848 precursor.\nOther parts of the constitution entrenched the [[rule of law]] and made it clear that Habsburg subjects would from now on be able to take the State to court should it violate their fundamental rights.{{sfnaut|Brauneder|2009|157}} Since regular courts were still unable to overrule the bureaucracy, much less the legislature, these guarantees necessitated the creation of specialist courts that could:{{sfnaut|Brauneder|2009|160\u2212161|Hoke|1996|403\u2212404}}\n* The Administrative Court ({{lang|de|Verwaltungsgerichtshof}}), stipulated by the 1867 Basic Law on Judicial Power ({{lang|de|Staatsgrundgesetz \u00fcber die richterliche Gewalt}}) and implemented in 1876, had the power to review the legality of administrative acts, ensuring that the executive branch remained faithful to the principle of the rule of law.\n* The Imperial Court ({{lang|de|Reichsgericht}}), stipulated by the Basic Law on the Creation of an Imperial Court ({{lang|de|Staatsgrundgesetz \u00fcber die Einrichtung eines Reichsgerichtes}}) in 1867 and implemented in 1869, decided demarcation conflicts between courts and the bureaucracy, between its constituent crown lands, and between one of the crown lands and the Empire itself.{{sfnaut|RGBl 1867/143||Art. 2}} It also adjudicated on financial liability claims raised by crown lands against each other, by a crown land against the Empire, by the Empire against a crown land, or by a person, corporation, or municipality against a crown land or the Empire.{{sfnaut|RGBl 1867/143||Art. 3c|Hoke|1996|400, 403}} Last but not least, the Imperial Court also heard complaints of citizens who alleged to have been violated in their constitutional rights, although its powers were not cassatory: it could only vindicate the complainant by {{em|declaring}} the government to be in the wrong, not by actually voiding its wrongful decisions.{{sfnaut|RGBl 1867/143||Art. 3c|Brauneder|2009|160|Hoke|1996|400}}\n* The State Court ({{lang|de|Staatsgerichtshof}}) held the Emperor's ministers accountable for political misconduct committed in office.{{sfnaut|RGBl 1867/145|||Brauneder|2009|161}} The State Court was an oblique and roundabout way of keeping the Emperor himself in check. The Emperor could not be taken to court, but under the terms of the Law on the Responsibility of Ministers ({{lang|de|Gesetz \u00fcber die Verantwortlichkeit der Minister}}) of 1867 he was no longer an autocrat; many of his decrees and injunctions now depended on the relevant minister to countersign them. The double-pronged approach of making the Emperor dependent on his ministers and also making ministers criminally liable for bad outcomes would firstly enable, secondly motivate the ministers to put pressure on the monarch.{{sfnaut|RGBl 1867/101||}} The statute in question actually predates the Constitution by a few months, but the Constitution conspicuously failed to abrogate it; it also expressly confirmed the legal inviolability of the person of the Emperor himself.{{sfnaut|Hoke|1996|394\u2212395}}\n\nThe December Constitution thus created the distinction between general courts and courts of public law.\n\n=== First Republic ===\n\nThe [[December Constitution]] remained in force essentially unaltered until the end of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] in 1918.\n\nThe end of [[Austria-Hungary]] was not a collapse so much as an explosion. Hungary broke away from Austria. The [[Slavs|Slavic]] peoples of Austria broke away from the German-speaking heartland, all essentially at the same time, and started establishing the [[nation state]]s they had been demanding for decades. The German-speaking remnant was demoralized, rudderless, and crippled by partisan strife.\nThe monarchy was discredited and its administration with it. None of the rump state's various legislative bodies had any real authority either. Provincial legislatures had been elected using a system of curia suffrage, meaning they had no democratic legitimacy. The House of Deputies, the lower chamber of the [[Imperial Council (Austria)|Imperial Council]], had been elected democratically, but the last election had been held in 1911.\nPolitical left and political right agreed that Austria should become a [[democracy|democratic]] [[republic]] but had fundamentally different ideas regarding many other aspects of their future constitutional framework.\n\nIn acknowledgment of their questionable standing, the remaining deputies decided to meet not as the House of Deputies but as the Provisional National Assembly. The Assembly would only make decisions that could not be delayed; it would retain as much as possible of the existing body of constitutional law until general elections could be held and a properly legitimized Constituting National Assembly could be convoked.{{sfnaut|StGBl 1918/5|||Brauneder|2009|189, 191\u2212192, 194}}\nIn particular, the Provisional Assembly made no drastic changes to the court system; it mainly updated the system of courts of public law:{{sfnaut|Brauneder|2009|201-202}}\n* The Administrative Court was retained.{{sfnaut|StGBl 1919/88||}}\n* The State Court was disbanded. In its original form, it was pointless without a monarch in possession of permanent and unqualified immunity; besides, it had never actually convened.{{sfnaut|Hoke|1996|395}} The responsibility for holding top officials accountable was transferred to a special committee of the Provisional National Assembly.{{sfnaut|StGBl 1918/1||\u00a79}}\n* The Imperial Court was renamed to Constitutional Court ({{lang|de|Verfassungsgerichtshof}}).{{sfnaut|StGBl 1919/48||}} In April 1919, the government transferred the responsibilities of the former State Court to the Constitutional Court{{sfnaut|StGBl 1919/212||Art. 1}} and also gave the Constitutional Court cassatory power: from now on, the court could not just {{em|note}} the unconstitutionality of an administrative decision, it could actually annul it, sending complainant and defendant back to square one.{{sfnaut|StGBl 1919/212||Art. 5|Brauneder|2009|201}}\n* A special Election Court ({{lang|de|Wahlgerichtshof}}) was created to handle complaints regarding the upcoming Constituting Assembly election.{{sfnaut|StGBl 1919/90|||Brauneder|2009|202}}\n\nThe only other significant change involved the Supreme Court: its name was shortened to its modern form.{{sfnaut|StGBl 1918/38|||StGBl 1919/41||}}\n\nThe new, permanent [[Federal Constitutional Law (Austrian act)|Kelsen constitution]] of 1920 finally gave the Constitutional Court the power of [[judicial review]]. The court was now able to void regulations that violated the law and laws that violated the constitution. It also acquired responsibility for handling election complaints; the Kelsen constitution did not retain the Election Court.{{sfnaut|BGBl 1920/1||\u00a7\u00a7139\u2212141|Brauneder|2009|223}}\n\nAustrian courts other than the Constitutional Court have no power of judicial review to this day; they cannot strike or refuse to apply laws they consider unconstitutional, although they can (and are required to) refuse to apply laws they think have not been constitutionally enacted or promulgated.

]]\n[[Category:Judiciary of Austria]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:AT 50473 Justizpalast Wien, Iustitia - Emanuel Pendl 4293-HDR.jpg|thumb|right|A statue of [[Lady Justice|Iustitia]] in the Austrian [[Palace of Justice (Vienna)|Palace of Justice]], the seat of one of the country's top courts]]\nThe '''Judiciary of Austria''' ({{lang-de|\u00f6sterreichische Justiz}}) is the [[separation of powers|branch]] of the [[politics of Austria|Austrian government]] responsible for resolving disputes between residents or between residents and the government, holding criminals accountable, making sure that the [[legislature|legislative]] and [[executive (government)|executive]] branches remain faithful to the [[European Union|European]] and [[constitution of Austria|Austrian constitution]]s and to international [[human rights]] standards, and generally upholding the [[rule of law]].\nThe judiciary is [[judicial independence|independent]] of the other two branches of government and is committed to guaranteeing [[right to a fair trial|fair trial]]s and [[equality before the law]]. It has broad and effective powers of [[judicial review in Austria|judicial review]].\n\nStructurally, the Austrian judiciary is divided into general courts ({{lang|de|ordentliche Gerichte}}) and courts of public law ({{lang|de|Gerichte \u00f6ffentlichen Rechts}}).\nThe general courts handle [[lawsuit|civil]] and criminal trials as well as non-adversary proceedings such as inheritance cases or legal guardianship matters.\nThe courts of public law supervise the other two branches of government: the administrative court system reviews the legality of administrative acts; the [[Constitutional Court (Austria)|Constitutional Court]] adjudicates on complaints regarding the constitutionality of statutes, the legality of ordinances, and the conduct of elected officials and political appointees in office.\n\nIn addition to the court system proper, the judicial arm of Austrian state power includes the state prosecution service ({{lang|de|Staatsanwaltschaft}}), the prisons ({{lang|de|Justizanstalten}}) and the [[Justizwache|correctional officers' corps]] ({{lang|de|Justizwache}}). Remand prisons for pre-trial detention or other types of non-correctional custody ({{lang|de|Polizeianhaltezentren}}) belong to the [[executive (government)|executive branch]].\nThe judiciary is assisted by the [[Ministry of Justice (Austria)|Ministry of Justice]] ({{lang|de|Justizministerium}}), a cabinet-level division of the national executive.\n\n{{toclimit|limit=3}}\n\n== Organization ==\n\nThe administration of justice in [[Austria]] is the sole responsibility of the federal government. Judges and prosecutors are recruited, trained, and employed by the Republic; courts hand down verdicts in the name of the Republic ({{lang|de|im Namen der Republik}}). There is no such thing, for example, as an Austrian county court.{{sfnaut|B-VG||Art. 82|Berka|2016|273|\u00d6hlinger|2007|269}}\n\nThe court system has two branches:\n* general courts ({{lang|de|ordentliche Gerichte}}) try criminal cases and (most) civil cases;{{efn|Some authors, mostly Austrians, translate \"{{lang|de|ordentliche Gerichte}}\" as \"ordinary courts\". Among authors who speak English as a first language, \"general courts\" predominates.}}\n* courts of public law ({{lang|de|Gerichte \u00f6ffentlichten Rechts}}) try (some of the) civil cases in which the respondent is a government authority:{{efn|Sometimes translated as \"public courts\"; see above.}}\n**the [[Constitutional Court (Austria)|Constitutional Court]] ({{lang|de|Verfassungsgerichtshof}}) tries liability claims against the republic, a province, or a municipality and exercises [[judicial review]] of legislation;\n**a system of administrative courts ({{lang|de|Verwaltungsgerichte}}) exercises judicial review of administrative actions.\n\nJudges are [[judicial independence|independent]]. Appointments are for life; judges cannot be removed or reassigned without their consent. In courts with more than one judge \u2212 which is essentially all of them \u2212 there has to be a fixed and specific apportionment of responsibilities ({{lang|de|feste Gesch\u00e4ftseinteilung}}) to prevent the government from influencing outcomes by hand-picking a judge sympathetic to its perspective.{{sfnaut|B-VG||Art. 87\u221288|Berka|2016|269\u2212271|\u00d6hlinger|2007|269\u2212270}}\nFor example, if a litigant files for divorce in a court with multiple judges handling divorce cases, the first letter of their last name decides which judge they are assigned.{{sfnaut|Berka|2016|270}}\n\nJudges presiding over trials are professionals. In order to become eligible for appointment to a bench, a prospective judge needs to have a master's degree or equivalent in Austrian law, undergo four years of post-graduate training, and pass an exam. The training includes theoretical instruction and internship-type practical work in an actual courthouse. Appointments to benches are made by the [[President of Austria|president]], although the president can and does delegate most of this responsibility to the [[Ministry of Justice (Austria)|minister of justice]]. Nominations come from within the judiciary; panels of judges suggest candidates for benches with vacancies.{{sfnaut|B-VG||Art.86|\u00d6hlinger|2007|270}}\n\nThere is no [[military justice]] in peacetime; members of the military are tried by the regular court system.{{sfnaut|B-VG||Art. 84|\u00d6hlinger|2007|269}}\n\n== Procedure ==\n\n[[File:Landesgericht Wels.JPG|thumb|right|The seat of the [[Wels]] regional court]]\nTrials are oral and public.{{sfnaut|B-VG||Art. 90 (1)|Berka|2016|271\u2212272, 560\u2212561|\u00d6hlinger|2007|272, 439\u2212433}}\n\nCivil trials are [[adversarial system|adversarial trials]] ({{lang|de|streitige Verfahren}}).\nThe court evaluates evidence brought before it by the parties to the trial but makes no attempt to uncover any additional evidence or otherwise investigate the matter itself.\nCriminal trials are [[inquisitorial system|inquisitorial trials]] ({{lang|de|Anklageverfahren}}).{{efn|In [[German language|German]], {{lang|de|inquisitorisches Verfahren}} is only used to denote inquisitorial trials in which judge and prosecutor are the same person, or the same panel. An inquisitorial trial in which judge and prosecution are separate entities is called an {{lang|de|Anklageverfahren}}, literally \"prosecutorial trial\". There has been no {{lang|de|inquisitorisches Verfahren}} in Austria since the 1870s.}}{{sfnaut|B-VG||Art. 90 (2)|Berka|2016|272|\u00d6hlinger|2007|272}}\nThe court is actively involved, questioning witnesses brought forward by the parties to the trials, summoning expert witnesses on its own initiative, and generally attempting to determine the truth.\nMost trials are bench trials, although the bench will often be a panel including one or more [[lay judge]]s ({{lang|de|Sch\u00f6ffen}}). Criminal defendants accused of political transgressions or of serious crimes with severe penalties have a right to trial by jury.{{sfnaut|B-VG||Art. 91|Berka|2016|274|\u00d6hlinger|2007|270}}\n\nPursuant to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], which has been adopted into the Austrian constitution, but also to Austrian constitutional law preceding it, criminal defendants are protected by the set of procedural guarantees typical for modern [[liberal democracy|liberal democracies]]. Among other things, defendants\n* are [[presumption of innocence|presumed innocent until proven guilty]];{{sfnaut|StPO||\u00a78, \u00a714|Berka|2016|272, 563\u2212564|\u00d6hlinger|2007|434}}\n* have the right to a [[speedy trial]];{{sfnaut|StPO||\u00a79|Berka|2016|561\u2212562|\u00d6hlinger|2007|432}}\n* cannot be tried [[trial in absentia|in absentia]];{{sfnaut|StPO||\u00a76|\u00d6hlinger|2007|429\u2212430}}\n* cannot be forced to incriminate themselves;{{sfnaut|StPO||\u00a77|Berka|2016|272, 564\u2212565}}\n* cannot be tried for transgressions that are not specifically defined to be criminal offenses by statutory law, or that {{em|were}} not specifically defined to be criminal offenses by statutory law {{em|at the time they were committed}} (\"[[nulla poena sine lege]]\");{{sfnaut|Berka|2016|566|\u00d6hlinger|2007|425}}\n* cannot be prosecuted twice for the same crime, alleged or actual (\"[[non bis in idem]]\");{{sfnaut|StPO||\u00a717|Berka|2016|566\u2212568|\u00d6hlinger|2007|438\u2212439}}\n* have a right to an appeal.{{sfnaut|Berka|2016|568\u2212569|\u00d6hlinger|2007|437}}\n\nThe right to an appeal is taken seriously. Any party to any trial before a general court can file an appeal on facts and law ({{lang|de|Berufung}}).{{sfnaut|StPO||\u00a7280|ZPO||\u00a7461}}\nIf the case is a civil case, the appellate court first checks whether the trial court has committed procedural errors; if yes, it orders a retrial, sending the case back to the trial court.{{sfnaut|ZPO||\u00a7477, \u00a7494, \u00a7496}}\nIf no, or if the case is criminal, the appellate court conducts what is essentially a retrial itself \u2212 the appellate trial does not merely review questions of law but also questions of fact, assessing evidence and questioning witnesses.{{sfnaut|ZPO||\u00a7482, \u00a7484}}\n\nIn addition to the appeal on facts and law against the verdict of the trial court, an appeal at law ({{lang|de|Revision}} in civil trials, {{lang|de|Nichtigkeitsbeschwerde}} in criminal cases) can be filed against the verdict of the appellate court.{{sfnaut|StPO||\u00a7\u00a7502-505|ZPO||\u00a7280}}\nIn criminal cases, appeals at law that are not obviously frivolous are also handled in public hearings.{{sfnaut|StPO||\u00a7\u00a7285c-285d, \u00a7286}} A successful appeal at law not just overturns but completely erases the verdict of the appellate court, sending the case down the ladder again.\nVerdicts of trial courts \u2212 although not of appellate courts \u2212 that result from the trial court's application of an unconstitutional statute or an illegal ordinance can additionally be fought with extraordinary appeals at law to the Constitutional Court.\n\n<!-- mostly happy with everything from top to here -->\n\n== General courts ==\n\nThe hierarchy of general courts has four levels: district, regional, higher regional, and supreme.{{sfnaut|StPO||\u00a729}}\n\nFor most cases, [[original jurisdiction]] lies with one of the district courts; its decision can be appealed to the relevant regional court. Some cases are first tried before the regional court and can be appealed to the higher regional court. Higher regional courts and the Supreme Court do not have original jurisdiction; they exclusively hear appeals.\n\nOne of the peculiarities of the Austrian judiciary is its strict organizational separation of civil and criminal justice.\nCourts are divided into civil and criminal chambers; judges spend their days trying either civil cases or criminal cases but never both.\nIn [[Vienna]] and in [[Graz]] \u2212 the country's two largest cities by a wide margin \u2212 the two chambers of the regional court are actually two completely separate courts, housed in separate buildings. In Vienna, there is a third regional court for trials at mercantile law ({{lang|de|Handelsgericht}}) and a fourth regional court for cases involving employment and social assistance law ({{lang|de|Arbeits- und Sozialgericht}}). Normally, original jurisdiction over disputes in these areas of law would lie with the civil regional court. As an additional special case, the higher regional court in Vienna has original jurisdiction over antitrust cases.\n\n=== District courts ===\n\nThere are currently 115 district courts ({{lang|de|Bezirksgerichte}}).\nMost judicial districts are coextensive with one of the country's 94 [[District (Austria)|administrative districts]], although there are exceptions.\nSome of the larger administrative districts are partitioned into two of ore judicial districts. The extreme case is the [[Vienna|City of Vienna]], home to no fewer than 12 separate district courts.\nIn some cases, a district court serving a city also serves part of the surrounding suburbs. In others, two or three very small administrative districts are lumped together into a single judicial zone.\n\nDistrict courts are responsible for\n* civil trials ({{lang|de|Zivilverfahren}}) involving matrimonial and family matters, real estate rental or lease matters, real estate boundary or easement disputes, or trespass to land;\n* most simple debt collection, foreclosure, and bankruptcy matters;\n* other civil trials with the amount in dispute not exceeding EUR 15,000, excepting employment and social assistance disputes;\n* most criminal trials ({{lang|de|Strafverfahren}}) involving finable offenses or jailable offenses with a jail term of no more than one year;{{sfnaut|StPO||\u00a730 (1)}}\n* most non-adversary matters ({{lang|de|Au\u00dferstreitsachen}}), for example probate proceedings, adoptions, declarations of death in absentia, or invalidation of lost securities certificates;\n* most adversary non-trial matters ({{lang|de|streitige Au\u00dferstreitsachen}}), including but not limited to child custody disputes, child maintenance and visitation rights disputes, appointments of legal guardians for senile elders or the mentally ill, or expropriation proceedings;\n* maintaining the land register.\n\nTrials before the district court are bench trials decided by a single judge ({{lang|de|Bezirksrichter}}).{{sfnaut|StPO||\u00a730 (2)}} Non-adversary proceedings, debt collection, foreclosure, bankruptcy, and land register matters can also be decided by a judiciary clerk ({{lang|de|Rechtspfleger}}).\n\nWhile there are permanent district judges, there are no district {{em|attorneys}}. Criminal trials are prosecuted by a state attorney ({{lang|de|Staatsanwalt}}) attached to the relevant regional court. In minor cases, the public prosecutor can assign a district prosecutor ({{lang|de|Bezirksanwalt}}) to substitute for them. The district prosecutor is not necessarily an attorney, however, and cannot act on their own initiative or authority.{{sfnaut|StPO||\u00a720}}\n\n=== Regional courts ===\n[[File:Schillerstrasse 1 Gericht Feldkirch 1.JPG|thumb|right|The seat of the [[Feldkirch, Vorarlberg|Feldkirch]] regional court]]\nThere are 18 regional courts ({{lang|de|Landesgerichte}}) in Austria; their seats are in [[Eisenstadt]], [[Feldkirch, Vorarlberg|Feldkirch]], [[Graz]], [[Innsbruck]], [[Klagenfurt]], [[Korneuburg]], [[Krems an der Donau]], [[Leoben]], [[Linz]], [[Ried im Innkreis]], [[Salzburg]], [[Sankt P\u00f6lten]], [[Steyr]], [[Vienna]], [[Wels]], and [[Wiener Neustadt]]. In Graz and Vienna, the civil and criminal chambers set up as two separate courts, meaning that Graz and Vienna each have a civil regional court ({{lang|de|Landesgericht f\u00fcr Zivilrechtssachen}}) and a criminal regional court ({{lang|de|Landesgericht f\u00fcr Strafrechtssachen}}).\n\nRegional courts are responsible for\n* exercising original jurisdiction over all civil and criminal matters not handled by district courts;\n* hearing appeals on facts and law ({{lang|de|Berufungen}}) against district court decisions;\n* keeping the company register.\n\nIn cases for which the regional court has original jurisdiction, the trial is usually a bench trial decided by a single professional judge,{{sfnaut|StPO||\u00a731 (4)}} but there are several exceptions:\n* Suits at employment law or social assistance law are decided by a panel of three judges, one professional judge ({{lang|de|Berufsrichter}}) and two [[lay judge]]s ({{lang|de|Laienrichter}}). The lay judges are {{em|expert}} lay judges ({{lang|de|fachkundige Laienrichter}}) and are effectively meant to double as court-appointed disinterested expert witnesses.\n* Other civil suits can be tried by three-judge panels upon request of the parties if the amount in dispute exceeds EUR 100,000. In cases at mercantile law, the panel consists of two professional judges and one expert lay judge ({{lang|de|fachm\u00e4nnischer Laienrichter}} here). In other cases, the panel consists of three professional judges.\n* Criminal trials are held before three-judge panels, four-judge panels, or juries in cases of alleged homicide, sexual assault, robbery, certain types of grand larceny or fraud, and in any case where the alleged crime carries a maximum jail term of more than five years. The specifics are somewhat involved; the following is a rough outline:\n** Most of the cases outlined above go before a three-judge panel consisting of one professional judge and two lay judges ({{lang|de|Sch\u00f6ffen}}).{{sfnaut|StPO||\u00a731 (3), \u00a732 (1)}}\n** In cases of alleged manslaughter, aggravated robbery, rape, membership in a terrorist organization, abuse of official authority, or financial crimes causing more than EUR 1,000,000 in damage, a second professional judge is added to the panel.{{sfnaut|StPO||\u00a732 (1a)}}\n** Charges of murder, actual terrorist violence, or armed insurrection are jury trials decided by three professional judges and eight jurors ({{lang|de|Geschworene}}). The same is true for treason, a number of other political crimes, and all other crimes with minimum jail terms of more than five and maximum jail terms of more than ten years.{{sfnaut|StPO||\u00a731 (2)}}\n\nIn criminal trials, some effort is made to prevent panels and juries from being biased or unable to empathize with either defendants or alleged victims. If the crime alleged is a sexual assault or some other violation of a person's sexual integrity serious enough to warrant a panel, then at least one of the judges must belong to the same sex as the alleged victim. If there is a jury, then at least two of the jurors must be of the same sex as the alleged victim.{{sfnaut|StPO||\u00a732 (2)}} If the defendant is juvenile and the alleged crime is serious enough to warrant a panel, then at least one of the judges must be of the same sex as the defendant and at least one of the judges must be a present or former educator or competent social worker. If there is a jury, at least two of the jurors must be of the relevant sex and at least four must have the relevant job experience.{{sfnaut|JGG||\u00a728}}\n\nAppeals of district courts decisions to regional courts are decided by three-judge panels: two professional judges and one expert lay judge in trials at mercantile law, three professional judges in all other civil matters and in all criminal cases.{{sfnaut|StPO||\u00a731 (6)}}\n\nRoutine company register decisions are made by single judges or by judicial clerks.\n\nAttached to every regional court dealing with criminal trials, there is a branch of the state prosecution service ({{lang|de|Staatsanwaltschaft}}) and a [[prison]] ({{lang|de|Justizanstalt}}). Regional courts and regional-level state prosecutors organize and supervise most of the pre-trial work ({{lang|de|Ermittlungsverfahren}}) in Austria, even in cases in which the main court proceedings ({{lang|de|Hauptverfahren}}) are going to take place in a district court. In many ways, the regional courts are the backbone of the Austrian judiciary.\n\n=== Higher regional courts ===\n\nThere are four higher regional courts ({{lang|de|Oberlandesgerichte}}).

The Constitution ({{lang|de|Verfassung}}) was abrogated in 1852 and replaced with a number of \"constitutional principles\" ({{lang|de|Verfassungsgrunds\u00e4tze}}) that sounded vaguely progressive but did not actually bind the ruling house to any real degree.

Trials were no longer public. Trials before higher regional courts and the supreme court were no longer oral. On the district level, the [[separation of powers]] was abandoned, at least on paper.

The continuing rise of [[civic nationalism]] and continuing demands by Austria's [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] and [[Slavs|Slavic]] subjects for material autonomy, exacerbated by a series of diplomatic setbacks, kept eroding the cohesion of the empire and the personal authority of the Emperor. By 1861, Franz Joseph was forced to grant a third constitution. Following his defeat in the [[Austro-Prussian War]] in 1866, he was forced to give up for good on his desire to remain the sole sovereign and font of law. In the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]], the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] received near-complete independence.

The Emperor could not be taken to court, but under the terms of the Law on the Responsibility of Ministers ({{lang|de|Gesetz \u00fcber die Verantwortlichkeit der Minister}}) of 1867 he was no longer an autocrat; many of his decrees and injunctions now depended on the relevant minister to countersign them. The double-pronged approach of making the Emperor dependent on his ministers and also making ministers criminally liable for bad outcomes would firstly enable, secondly motivate the ministers to put pressure on the monarch.{{sfnaut|RGBl 1867/101||}} The statute in question actually predates the Constitution by a few months, but the Constitution conspicuously failed to abrogate it; it also expressly confirmed the legal inviolability of the person of the Emperor himself.{{sfnaut|Hoke|1996|394\u2212395}}\n\nThe December Constitution thus created the distinction between general courts and courts of public law.\n\n=== First Republic ===\n\nThe [[December Constitution]] remained in force essentially unaltered until the end of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] in 1918.\n\nThe end of [[Austria-Hungary]] was not a collapse so much as an explosion. Hungary broke away from Austria. The [[Slavs|Slavic]] peoples of Austria broke away from the German-speaking heartland, all essentially at the same time, and started establishing the [[nation state]]s they had been demanding for decades. The German-speaking remnant was demoralized, rudderless, and crippled by partisan strife.\nThe monarchy was discredited and its administration with it. None of the rump state's various legislative bodies had any real authority either. Provincial legislatures had been elected using a system of curia suffrage, meaning they had no democratic legitimacy. The House of Deputies, the lower chamber of the [[Imperial Council (Austria)|Imperial Council]], had been elected democratically, but the last election had been held in 1911.\nPolitical left and political right agreed that Austria should become a [[democracy|democratic]] [[republic]] but had fundamentally different ideas regarding many other aspects of their future constitutional framework.\n\nIn acknowledgment of their questionable standing, the remaining deputies decided to meet not as the House of Deputies but as the Provisional National Assembly.

The images included children with predominantly European features photographed alongside dark-skinned adult slaves with typically African features. It was intended to shock the viewing audiences with a reminder that slaves shared their humanity, and evidence that slaves did not belong in the category of the \"[[Other (philosophy)|Other]]\".\n\n==Historical background==\nSexual exploitation of slaves by their masters, master's sons, overseers, or other powerful white men was so common in the United States as to be routine. (See [[Children of the plantation]].) By the [[1860 Census]], mixed-race slaves constituted about 10% of the 4 million slaves enumerated; they were more numerous in the Upper South. Slavery had existed for a longer time there, and in the generally smaller holdings, slaves had lived more closely with white workers and masters, leading to more contact with whites. About 5% of slaves born in the [[Southern U.S.]] are believed to have been fathered by white masters.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} <!--Genetic analysis of African Americans shows high proportion of European ancestry - use that instead; Henry Louis Gates Jr's book has data on this --> \n\nAn analysis of the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] [[Slave Narrative Collection]], collected in the 1930s, shows that, when women discussed parentage at all, about one-third of these women ex-slaves said they had given birth to a child with a white father, or were themselves the child of a white father.<ref>{{cite web|title=Free at Last?

Supporters of the war believed that this was needed after [[New York City draft riots|the draft riots]] in [[New York City]] that year. Predominantly ethnic Irish mobs had protested the draft law, as wealthier men could buy substitutes rather than serve in the war.\n\nCarol Goodman, in \"Visualizing the Color Line,\" has argued that the photos alluded to physical and sexual abuse of the children's mothers. When publishing the photo of the eight former slaves, the editor of ''Harper's Weekly'' wrote that slavery permits slave-holding \"'gentlemen' [to] seduce [the] most friendless and defenseless of women.\" The specter of \"white\" girls being sold as \"fancy girls\" or [[concubines]] in Southern slave markets may have caused Northern families to fear for the safely of their own daughters. Similarly, the idea that white slave-master fathers would sell their own children in slave markets raised Northerners' concerns.\n\n[[Gwendolyn DuBois Shaw]], in \"Portraits of a People,\" has argued that the usage of props, such as the [[Flag of the United States|American flag]] and books, helped to provide context for Northern viewers, and also to emphasize that the purpose of the photos was to raise money for education of former slaves by funding schools in [[Louisiana]]. She also noted that the use of \"white\" children to illustrate the damage caused by institutional slavery, whose victims were overwhelmingly visibly people of color, demonstrated the contemporary racism of both Southern and Northern societies.<ref name=CaustEllenbogen />\n\n==See also==\n*[[Julia Chinn]]\n*[[Louisa Picquet]]\n*[[Mary Mildred Williams]]\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist}}\n\n'''Further reading'''\n*{{cite book|last1=Tenzer|first1=Lawrence Raymond|title=The Forgotten Cause of the Civil War: A New Look at the Slavery Issue|date=1997|publisher=Scholars' Publishing House|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EGkOAQAAMAAJ}} See especially [http://multiracial.com/site/index.php/2001/10/01/white-slaves/ Ch.III]\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=p5U-AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA32-IA29&lpg=PA32-IA29#v=onepage&q&f=false Fremont Campaign Literature, 1856]\n*[[Henry Louis Gates, Jr.]], [http://www.theroot.com/articles/history/2013/02/how_mixed_are_african_americans/ Exactly How \u2018Black\u2019 Is Black America?]\n*{{cite book|last1=Janken|first1=Kenneth Robert|title=Walter White: Mr. NAACP|date=2006|publisher=UNC Press Books|isbn=9780807857809|pages=3\u20135|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cTVZ6N9vHxsC}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category-inline|White slave propaganda}}\n{{Wikisource-inline|The Barbarism of Slavery}}\n*[http://www.nydailynews.com/news/white-slave-children-new-orleans-1860s-propaganda-campaign-gallery-1.1164989?pmSlide=0 Image gallery]\n\n[[Category:Abolitionism in the United States]]\n[[Category:Colorism]]\n[[Category:Propaganda in the United States]]\n[[Category:Skin pigmentation]]\n[[Category:Slavery in the United States]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:White slavery woodcut.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|A woodcut (based on a photograph) that was published in ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' on 30 January 1864 with the caption, \"EMANCIPATED SLAVES, WHITE AND COLORED.\"]]\n'''White slave propaganda''' is the term given to publicity, especially photograph and woodcuts, and also novels, articles, and popular lectures, about mixed-race, white-looking slaves, which was used during and prior to the [[American Civil War]] to further the [[abolitionist]] cause and to raise money for the education of former slaves.

(See [[Children of the plantation]].) By the [[1860 Census]], mixed-race slaves constituted about 10% of the 4 million slaves enumerated; they were more numerous in the Upper South. Slavery had existed for a longer time there, and in the generally smaller holdings, slaves had lived more closely with white workers and masters, leading to more contact with whites. About 5% of slaves born in the [[Southern U.S.]] are believed to have been fathered by white masters.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} <!--Genetic analysis of African Americans shows high proportion of European ancestry - use that instead; Henry Louis Gates Jr's book has data on this --> \n\nAn analysis of the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] [[Slave Narrative Collection]], collected in the 1930s, shows that, when women discussed parentage at all, about one-third of these women ex-slaves said they had given birth to a child with a white father, or were themselves the child of a white father.<ref>{{cite web|title=Free at Last?

Accordingly, in 1786, Columbia was designated to be the new capital, one of the first [[planned cities]] in the United States. The legislature first met there at the [[South Carolina State House#Old Carolina State House|Old State House]] in 1790.{{sfn|Flynn|p=78}} That building proved subject to flooding and damp\u2014a poor place to store important state records. Work began on a new building in 1856 but was interrupted by the [[American Civil War]]; the Old State House was burned following its capture by Union troops in 1865. South Carolina had little money for capitol construction after the war, and the new building was not completed until 1903.{{sfn|Stang|pp=57\u201358}}\n\nUntil 1954, the entire mintage of commemorative coin issues was sold by the government at face value to a group authorized by Congress, who then tried to sell the coins at a profit to the public. The new pieces then came on to the secondary market. In early 1936 all earlier commemoratives sold at a premium to their issue prices. The apparent easy profits to be made by purchasing and holding commemoratives attracted many to the hobby of [[coin collecting]], where they sought to purchase the new issues. This led to many commemorative coin proposals in Congress, including some of purely local significance.{{sfn|Bowers|pp=62\u201363}} These bills passed despite the fact the Treasury Department opposed the issuance of commemorative coins, and President [[Franklin D.

The figure of Justice on the obverse was made less \"slumpy\", and the leaves of the [[wikt:palmetto|palmetto]] on the reverse idealized. On July 22, the revised models were approved by the CFA, and they also met the approval of Treasury Secretary [[Henry Morgenthau Jr.|Henry Morgenthau]].{{sfn|Taxay|p=181}}\n\n== Design ==\nThe obverse of the Columbia half dollar depicts [[Lady Justice]], bearing a sword and a set of scales, though lacking the blindfold used in many depictions. To her left and right are South Carolina's old and new state houses, with one of the anniversary dates under each.  If the coin was struck at the [[Denver Mint]] or at [[San Francisco Mint|San Francisco]], the appropriate [[mint mark]] appears beneath her\u2014at the time, the [[Philadelphia Mint]] did not use one. The word {{small|LIBERTY}} appears to her left, and a statement of the anniversary rings the design.{{sfn|Swiatek|pp=321\u2013322}}\n\nThe reverse depicts a palmetto tree, the emblem of South Carolina. Arrows are tied to its base in a [[saltire]] pattern by a broad ribbon, signifying the tree's military connotation. On June 28, 1776, a British naval squadron tried to seize [[Fort Moultrie]] in [[Charleston Harbor]]. Though many shots were fired by the British ships, those that hit the fortifications were absorbed by the soft palmetto logs that formed it; the American death toll was 12 against hundreds of British killed by the fort's gunfire. The lopped oak branch at the palmetto's base symbolizes the oaken British vessels.{{sfn|Swiatek & Breen|p=53}} As Arlie Slabaugh Jr. put it in his volume on commemorative coins, \"the South Carolinians had proven in 1776 that the palmetto was superior to the oak of Old England, and so it appears above the oak on this coin\".{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=133}} The 13 stars surrounding the tree ostensibly symbolize the original American states, but may also have been intended to evoke the [[Confederate States of America]].{{sfn|Swiatek & Breen|p=53}} The name of the country, the coin's face value, and the mottos required by law appear on the reverse. Davidson's initials do not appear on the coin.{{sfn|Swiatek|p=322}}\n\nAccording to Carl Stang in his 2012 article on the Columbia half dollar, \"the coin generally is nice looking in virtually any condition\".{{sfn|Stang|p=59}} Numismatic author [[Q. David Bowers]] stated, \"The half dollar was attractive in its simplicity, and few numismatists\u2014who certainly are inclined to voice opinions if they don't like things\u2014felt moved to be critical.\"{{sfn|Bowers|p=344}} Art historian [[Cornelius Vermeule]], in his volume on American coins and medals, wrote, \"the coin presents a weak combination of allegorical obverse and symbolic reverse, with disparate lettering, cramped on one side and spread out irregularly on the other.\"{{sfn|Vermeule|p=200}} He deemed the obverse \"badly proportioned\" and the reverse \"boring; it recalls the nineteenth-century primitivism of a Spanish colonial or newly-independent South American country's large denominations in silver, but lacks the spontaneity of those rugged pieces of eight. The Columbia half-dollar, of course, lacks the rough feeling of work in a screw press evoked by these coins.\"{{sfn|Vermeule|p=200}}\n== Distribution and collecting ==\nThe anniversary celebrations in Columbia took place between March 22 and 29, 1936.{{sfn|Flynn|p=78}} On May 30, Senator Byrnes wrote to Director Ross, asking on behalf of Hammond that the coins be struck at all three of the mints then open. He further requested that if this was not possible, that some of the coins be struck dated 1936 and some dated 1937.{{sfn|Flynn|p=268}} A subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency had held hearings on March 11, at which there had been testimony that commemoratives were being struck at multiple mints and in multiple years to increase the number of [[Glossary of numismatics#V|varieties]] a collector needed for a complete set,{{sfn|Bowers|pp=210\u2013211}} but the Columbia bill, signed into law only a week later, allowed for striking at multiple mints, and this had occurred by the end of September 1936.{{sfn|Bowers|pp=343\u2013344}} 9,007 were struck at Philadelphia, 8,009 at Denver and 8,007 at San Francisco, with the excess over the even thousands held for examination and testing at the 1937 meeting of the annual [[Assay Commission]].{{sfn|Flynn|p=77}} Although the Columbia piece was the first new commemorative authorized in 1936, it thus became the last to be struck.{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=132}} The coins were not distributed immediately, but orders were taken at $2.15 for a single coin, with a set of three for $6.45. By October 19, 1936, the issue was oversubscribed by 15,000 coins, likely representing quantities desired by coin dealers. By the start of December, the coins remained undistributed, causing some adverse comment in the numismatic community.{{sfn|Bowers|p=344}}\n\nIn order to have a fair distribution of the coins, only small orders were filled. For the first 24 hours of sales, the coins were only available to residents of the city and could only be purchased by mail order.<ref name=ngc/><ref name=early/> Local residents could buy them at $2. Dealers were not able to obtain large quantities,{{sfn|Flynn|p=78}} causing them to list the coins for sale in their advertisements without a sales price.{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=133}} David Bullowa, in his 1938 monograph on commemoratives, wrote, \"the distribution was made by the commission on a very fair basis, and few persons were able to secure these coins in quantity. It made every endeavor to treat the collector fairly and to prevent the speculator from manipulating the prices of the sets in the open market, as had been done with many previous commemorative issues.\"{{sfn|Bullowa|p=132}} Most orders for a single set of coins were filled. Some sets were held back for other purposes: one was presented to President Roosevelt in February 1937 and six sets were placed in a [[time capsule]] that was opened in 1986, when those coins were sold for several thousand dollars a set.{{sfn|Bowers|pp=344\u2013345}}\n\nBy 1940, the sets were selling for about $6 each on the secondary market, a price that increased to $10 by 1950 and $100 by 1965. By 1980, they were $1,750 per set, a price that decreased thereafter.{{sfn|Bowers|p=346}} The deluxe edition of [[R. S. Yeoman]]'s ''[[A Guide Book of United States Coins]]'', published in 2018, lists the set for between $540 and $900, depending on condition, with individual pieces valued at a third of that.{{sfn|Yeoman|p=1089}} An exceptional specimen from the Denver Mint (1936\u2013D) sold for $15,863 in 2019.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=CoinWeek|last=Ferguson|first=Mark|date=February 28, 2020|accessdate=February 29, 2020|url=https://coinweek.com/education/coin-grading/price-records-emerge-for-finest-cac-commemorative-half-dollars/|title=Price records emerge for finest CAC commemorative half dollars}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|24em}}\n==Sources==\n\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Bowers\n  | first = Q.

Wolfe Davidson and minted in 1936. The [[obverse and reverse|obverse]] design depicts the personification of [[Lady Justice|justice]] holding a sword and scales, standing between the Old State House (built in 1790) and the [[South Carolina State House|New State House]] built (between 1855 and 1907). The reverse shows the [[Sabal palmetto|palmetto tree]], [[South Carolina]]'s state symbol, surrounded by 13 stars representing the original [[Thirteen Colonies]].\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe area around what is now [[Columbia, South Carolina]] was settled by British colonials as early as 1718, when [[Fort Congaree]] was established at [[Granby, South Carolina]], near the city's present site.{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=133}} Following the end of the [[American Revolutionary War]], the [[South Carolina Legislature]] was concerned that the state capital, [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], was too vulnerable for attack by sea and too far from the agricultural lands being developed. Accordingly, in 1786, Columbia was designated to be the new capital, one of the first [[planned cities]] in the United States, and the legislature first met there, at the [[South Carolina State House#Old Carolina State House|Old State House]] in 1790.{{sfn|Flynn|p=78}} That building proved subject to flooding and damp, and so a poor place to store important state records. Work began on a new building in 1856, but was interrupted by the [[American Civil War]]; the Old State House was burned following its capture by Union troops in 1865. South Carolina had little money for capitol construction after the war, and the new building was not completed until 1903.{{sfn|Stang|pp=57\u201358}}\n\nUntil 1954, the entire mintage of commemorative coin issues was sold by the government at face value to a group authorized by Congress, who then tried to sell the coins at a profit to the public. The new pieces then came on to the secondary market, and in early 1936 all earlier commemoratives sold at a premium to their issue prices. The apparent easy profits to be made by purchasing and holding commemoratives attracted many to the [[coin collecting]] hobby, where they sought to purchase the new issues. This led to many commemorative coin proposals in Congress, including some of purely local significance.{{sfn|Bowers|pp=62\u201363}} These bills passed despite the fact that the Treasury Department opposed the issuance of commemorative coins, and in 1935 President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] had asked that Congress pass no more such bills.<ref>{{cite book|author=United States Senate Committee on Banking and Currency|title=Commemorative coins and Mint bills|url=https://congressional.proquest.com/congressional/docview/t29.d30.hrg-1947-bcs-0003|url-access=subscription|date=February 10, 1947|publisher=United States Government Printing Office|pp=36\u201338}}</ref> The group designated to purchase the Columbia half dollar from the government was a committee to be established by Columbia's mayor, consisting of not fewer than three people.{{sfn|Flynn|p=353}}\n\n== Legislation ==\nThe coin was proposed by Columbia Sesqui-Centennial Commission, which wanted to strike commemorative coins for the 150th anniversary of the city's founding.<ref name=ngc>{{cite web|url=https://www.ngccoin.com/coin-explorer/silver-commemoratives-pscid-71/1936-d-columbia-50c-ms-coinid-19292|title=Silver Commemoratives \u2013 1936 D Columbia 50C MS|website=NGC Coin Explorer|accessdate=22 April 2019}}</ref> Legislation to authorize a Columbia half dollar was introduced on June 17, 1935 by South Carolina's [[Hampton P.

The figure of Justice on the obverse was made less \"slumpy\", and the leaves of the [[wikt:palmetto|palmetto]] on the reverse idealized. On July 22, the revised models were approved by the CFA, and they also met the approval of Treasury Secretary [[Henry Morgenthau Jr.|Henry Morgenthau]].{{sfn|Taxay|p=181}}\n\n== Design ==\nThe obverse of the Columbia half dollar depicts [[Lady Justice]], bearing a sword and a set of scales, though lacking the blindfold used in many depictions. To her left and right are South Carolina's old and new state houses, with one of the anniversary dates under each.  If the coin was struck at the [[Denver Mint]] or at [[San Francisco Mint|San Francisco]], the appropriate [[mint mark]] appears beneath her\u2014at the time, the [[Philadelphia Mint]] did not use one. The word {{small|LIBERTY}} appears to her left, and a statement of the anniversary rings the design.{{sfn|Swiatek|pp=321\u2013322}}\n\nThe reverse depicts a palmetto tree, the emblem of South Carolina. Arrows are tied to its base in a [[saltire]] pattern by a broad ribbon, signifying the tree's military connotation. On June 28, 1776, a British naval squadron tried to seize [[Fort Moultrie]] in [[Charleston Harbor]]. Though many shots were fired by the British ships, those that hit the fortifications were absorbed by the soft palmetto logs that formed it; the American death toll was 12 against hundreds of British killed by the fort's gunfire. The lopped oak branch at the palmetto's base symbolizes the oaken British vessels.{{sfn|Swiatek & Breen|p=53}} As Arlie Slabaugh Jr. put it in his volume on commemorative coins, \"the South Carolinians had proven in 1776 that the palmetto was superior to the oak of Old England, and so it appears above the oak on this coin\".{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=133}} The 13 stars surrounding the tree ostensibly symbolize the original American states, but may also have been intended to evoke the [[Confederate States of America]].{{sfn|Swiatek & Breen|p=53}} The name of the country, the coin's face value, and the mottos required by law appear on the reverse. Davidson's initials do not appear on the coin.{{sfn|Swiatek|p=322}}\n\nAccording to Carl Stang in his 2012 article on the Columbia half dollar, \"the coin generally is nice looking in virtually any condition\".{{sfn|Stang|p=59}} Numismatic author [[Q. David Bowers]] stated, \"The half dollar was attractive in its simplicity, and few numismatists\u2014who certainly are inclined to voice opinions if they don't like things\u2014felt moved to be critical.\"{{sfn|Bowers|p=344}} Art historian [[Cornelius Vermeule]], in his volume on American coins and medals, wrote, \"the coin presents a weak combination of allegorical obverse and symbolic reverse, with disparate lettering, cramped on one side and spread out irregularly on the other.\"{{sfn|Vermeule|p=200}} He deemed the obverse \"badly proportioned\" and the reverse \"boring; it recalls the nineteenth-century primitivism of a Spanish colonial or newly-independent South American country's large denominations in silver, but lacks the spontaneity of those rugged pieces of eight. The Columbia half-dollar, of course, lacks the rough feeling of work in a screw press evoked by these coins.\"{{sfn|Vermeule|p=200}}\n== Distribution and collecting ==\nThe anniversary celebrations in Columbia took place between March 22 and 29, 1936.{{sfn|Flynn|p=78}} On May 30, Senator Byrnes wrote to Director Ross, asking on behalf of Hammond that the coins be struck at all three of the mints then open. He further requested that if this was not possible, that some of the coins be struck dated 1936 and some dated 1937.{{sfn|Flynn|p=268}} A subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency had held hearings on March 11, at which there had been testimony that commemoratives were being struck at multiple mints and in multiple years to increase the number of [[Glossary of numismatics#V|varieties]] a collector needed for a complete set,{{sfn|Bowers|pp=210\u2013211}} but the Columbia bill, signed into law only a week later, allowed for striking at multiple mints, and this had occurred by the end of September 1936.{{sfn|Bowers|pp=343\u2013344}} 9,007 were struck at Philadelphia, 8,009 at Denver and 8,007 at San Francisco, with the excess over the even thousands held for examination and testing at the 1937 meeting of the annual [[Assay Commission]].{{sfn|Flynn|p=77}} Although the Columbia piece was the first new commemorative authorized in 1936, it thus became the last to be struck.{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=132}} The coins were not distributed immediately, but orders were taken at $2.15 for a single coin, with a set of three for $6.45. By October 19, 1936, the issue was oversubscribed by 15,000 coins, likely representing quantities desired by coin dealers. By the start of December, the coins remained undistributed, causing some adverse comment in the numismatic community.{{sfn|Bowers|p=344}}\n\nIn order to have a fair distribution of the coins, only small orders were filled. For the first 24 hours of sales, the coins were only available to residents of the city and could only be purchased by mail order.<ref name=ngc/><ref name=early/> Local residents could buy them at $2. Dealers were not able to obtain large quantities,{{sfn|Flynn|p=78}} causing them to list the coins for sale in their advertisements without a sales price.{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=133}} David Bullowa, in his 1938 monograph on commemoratives, wrote, \"the distribution was made by the commission on a very fair basis, and few persons were able to secure these coins in quantity. It made every endeavor to treat the collector fairly and to prevent the speculator from manipulating the prices of the sets in the open market, as had been done with many previous commemorative issues.\"{{sfn|Bullowa|p=132}} Most orders for a single set of coins were filled. Some sets were held back for other purposes: one was presented to President Roosevelt in February 1937 and six sets were placed in a [[time capsule]] that was opened in 1986, when those coins were sold for several thousand dollars a set.{{sfn|Bowers|pp=344\u2013345}}\n\nBy 1940, the sets were selling for about $6 each on the secondary market, a price that increased to $10 by 1950 and $100 by 1965. By 1980, they were $1,750 per set, a price that decreased thereafter.{{sfn|Bowers|p=346}} The deluxe edition of [[R. S. Yeoman]]'s ''[[A Guide Book of United States Coins]]'', published in 2018, lists the set for between $540 and $900, depending on condition, with individual pieces valued at a third of that.{{sfn|Yeoman|p=1089}} An exceptional specimen from the Denver Mint (1936\u2013D) sold for $15,863 in 2019.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=CoinWeek|last=Ferguson|first=Mark|date=February 28, 2020|accessdate=February 29, 2020|url=https://coinweek.com/education/coin-grading/price-records-emerge-for-finest-cac-commemorative-half-dollars/|title=Price records emerge for finest CAC commemorative half dollars}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|24em}}\n==Sources==\n\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Bowers\n  | first = Q.
