(or '''arithmetic''' or '''higher arithmetic''' in older usage) is a branch of [[pure mathematics]] devoted primarily to the study of the [[integer]]s and [[arithmetic function|integer-valued functions]]. German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777\u20131855) said, \"Mathematics is the queen of the sciences\u2014and number theory is the queen of mathematics.\"{{sfn|Long|1972|p=1}} Number theorists study [[prime number]]s as well as the properties of objects made out of integers (for example, [[rational number]]s) or defined as generalizations of the integers (for example, [[algebraic integer]]s). Number theory seeks to understand the properties of integer systems in spite of their apparent complexity.\n\nIntegers can be considered either in themselves or as solutions to equations ([[Diophantine geometry]]). Questions in number theory are often best understood through the study of [[Complex analysis|analytical]] objects (for example, the [[Riemann zeta function]]) that encode properties of the integers, primes or other number-theoretic objects in some fashion ([[analytic number theory]]). One may also study [[real number]]s in relation to rational numbers, for example, as approximated by the latter ([[Diophantine approximation]]).\n\nThe older term for number theory is ''arithmetic''. By the early twentieth century, it had been superseded by \"number theory\".<ref group=\"note\">Already in 1921, [[T. L. Heath]] had to explain: \"By arithmetic, Plato meant, not arithmetic in our sense, but the science which considers numbers in themselves, in other words, what we mean by the Theory of Numbers.\" {{harv|Heath|1921|p=13}}</ref> (The word \"[[arithmetic]]\" is used by the general public to mean \"[[Elementary arithmetic|elementary calculations]]\"; it has also acquired other meanings in [[mathematical logic]], as in ''[[Peano arithmetic]]'', and [[computer science]], as in ''[[floating point|floating point arithmetic]]''.) The use of the term ''arithmetic'' for ''number theory'' regained some ground in the second half of the 20th century, arguably in part due to French influence.<ref group=\"note\">Take, for example, {{harvnb|Serre|1973}}. In 1952, [[Harold Davenport|Davenport]] still had to specify that he meant ''The Higher Arithmetic''. [[G. H. Hardy|Hardy]] and Wright wrote in the introduction to ''[[An Introduction to the Theory of Numbers]]'' (1938): \"We proposed at one time to change [the title] to ''An introduction to arithmetic'', a more novel and in some ways a more appropriate title; but it was pointed out that this might lead to misunderstandings about the content of the book.\" {{harv|Hardy|Wright|2008}}</ref> In particular, ''arithmetical'' is preferred as an adjective to ''number-theoretic''.\n\n==History==\n===Origins===\n====Dawn of arithmetic====\n[[Image:Plimpton 322.jpg|right|thumb|The Plimpton 322 tablet]]\nThe earliest historical find of an arithmetical nature is a fragment of a table: the broken clay tablet [[Plimpton 322]] ([[Larsa|Larsa, Mesopotamia]], ca. 1800 BCE) contains a list of \"[[Pythagorean triples]]\", that is, integers <math>(a,b,c)</math> such that <math>a^2+b^2=c^2</math>.\nThe triples are too many and too large to have been obtained by [[brute force method|brute force]]. The heading over the first column reads: \"The ''takiltum'' of the diagonal which has been subtracted such that the width...\"<ref>{{harvnb|Neugebauer & Sachs|1945|p=40}}. The term ''takiltum'' is problematic. Robson prefers the rendering \"The holding-square of the diagonal from which 1 is torn out, so that the short side comes up...\".{{harvnb|Robson|2001|p=192}}</ref>\n\nThe table's layout suggests<ref>{{harvnb|Robson|2001|p=189}}. Other sources give the modern formula <math>(p^2-q^2,2pq,p^2+q^2)</math>. Van der Waerden gives both the modern formula and what amounts to the form preferred by Robson.{{harv|van der Waerden|1961|p=79}}</ref> that it was constructed by means of what amounts, in modern language, to the identity\n\n:<math>\\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\left(x - \\frac{1}{x}\\right)\\right)^2 + 1 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\left(x + \\frac{1}{x} \\right)\\right)^2,</math>\n\nwhich is implicit in routine Old Babylonian exercises.{{sfn|van der Waerden|1961|p=184}} If some other method was used,<ref>Neugebauer {{harv|Neugebauer|1969|pp=36\u201340}} discusses the table in detail and mentions in passing Euclid's method in modern notation {{harv|Neugebauer|1969|p=39}}.</ref> the triples were first constructed and then reordered by <math>c/a</math>, presumably for actual use as a \"table\", for example, with a view to applications.\n\nIt is not known what these applications may have been, or whether there could have been any; [[Babylonian astronomy]], for example, truly came into its own only later. It has been suggested instead that the table was a source of numerical examples for school problems.{{sfn|Friberg|1981|p=302}}<ref group=\"note\">{{harvnb|Robson|2001|p=201}}. This is controversial. See [[Plimpton 322]].

Like the Pythagoreans' perfect numbers, [[magic squares]] have passed from superstition into recreation.\n\n====Classical Greece and the early Hellenistic period====\n{{Further|Ancient Greek mathematics}}\n\nAside from a few fragments, the mathematics of Classical Greece is known to us either through the reports of contemporary non-mathematicians or through mathematical works from the early Hellenistic period.{{sfn|Boyer|Merzbach|1991|p=82}} In the case of number theory, this means, by and large, ''Plato'' and ''Euclid'', respectively.\n\nWhile Asian mathematics influenced Greek and Hellenistic learning, it seems to be the case that Greek mathematics is also an indigenous tradition.\n\n[[Eusebius]], PE X, chapter 4 mentions of [[Pythagoras]]:\n\n<blockquote>\"In fact the said Pythagoras, while busily studying the wisdom of each nation, visited Babylon, and Egypt, and all Persia, being instructed by the Magi and the priests: and in addition to these he is related to have studied under the Brahmans (these are Indian philosophers); and from some he gathered astrology, from others geometry, and arithmetic and music from others, and different things from different nations, and only from the wise men of Greece did he get nothing, wedded as they were to a poverty and dearth of wisdom: so on the contrary he himself became the author of instruction to the Greeks in the learning which he had procured from abroad.\"<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/eusebius_pe_10_book10.htm | title=Eusebius of Caesarea: Praeparatio Evangelica (Preparation for the Gospel). Tr. E.H. Gifford (1903) \u2013 Book 10}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAristotle claimed that the philosophy of Plato closely followed the teachings of the Pythagoreans,<ref>Metaphysics, 1.6.1 (987a)</ref> and Cicero repeats this claim: ''Platonem ferunt didicisse Pythagorea omnia'' (\"They say Plato learned all things Pythagorean\").<ref>Tusc. Disput. 1.17.39.</ref>\n\n[[Plato]] had a keen interest in mathematics, and distinguished clearly between arithmetic and calculation. (By ''arithmetic'' he meant, in part, theorising on number, rather than what ''arithmetic'' or ''number theory'' have come to mean.) It is through one of Plato's dialogues\u2014namely, [[Theaetetus (dialogue)|''Theaetetus'']]\u2014that we know that [[Theodorus of Cyrene|Theodorus]] had proven that <math>\\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{5}, \\dots, \\sqrt{17}</math> are irrational. [[Theaetetus of Athens|Theaetetus]] was, like Plato, a disciple of Theodorus's; he worked on distinguishing different kinds of [[Commensurability (mathematics)|incommensurables]], and was thus arguably a pioneer in the study of [[number systems]]. (Book X of [[Euclid's Elements]] is described by [[Pappus of Alexandria|Pappus]] as being largely based on Theaetetus's work.)\n\n[[Euclid]] devoted part of his ''Elements'' to prime numbers and divisibility, topics that belong unambiguously to number theory and are basic to it (Books VII to IX of [[Euclid's Elements]]). In particular, he gave an algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor of two numbers (the [[Euclidean algorithm]]; ''Elements'', Prop. VII.2) and the first known proof of the [[infinitude of primes]] (''Elements'', Prop. IX.20).\n\nIn 1773, [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]] published an [[epigram]] he had found in a manuscript during his work as a librarian; it claimed to be a letter sent by [[Archimedes]] to [[Eratosthenes]].{{sfn|Vardi|1998|pp=305\u201319}}{{sfn|Weil|1984|pp=17\u201324}} The epigram proposed what has become known as\n[[Archimedes's cattle problem]]; its solution (absent from the manuscript) requires solving an indeterminate quadratic equation (which reduces to what would later be misnamed [[Pell's equation]]). As far as we know, such equations were first successfully treated by the [[#\u0100ryabha\u1e6da, Brahmagupta, Bh\u0101skara|Indian school]]. It is not known whether Archimedes himself had a method of solution.\n\n====Diophantus====\n[[Image:Diophantus-cover.jpg|thumb|upright|Title page of the 1621 edition of Diophantus's ''Arithmetica'', translated into [[Latin]] by [[Claude Gaspard Bachet de M\u00e9ziriac]].]]\n\nVery little is known about [[Diophantus of Alexandria]]; he probably lived in the third century CE, that is, about five hundred years after Euclid. Six out of the thirteen books of Diophantus's ''[[Arithmetica]]'' survive in the original Greek; four more books survive in an Arabic translation. The ''Arithmetica'' is a collection of worked-out problems where the task is invariably to find rational solutions to a system of polynomial equations, usually of the form <math>f(x,y)=z^2</math> or <math>f(x,y,z)=w^2</math>. Thus, nowadays, we speak of ''Diophantine equations'' when we speak of polynomial equations to which rational or integer solutions must be found.\n\nOne may say that Diophantus was studying rational points, that is, points whose coordinates are rational\u2014on [[curve]]s and [[algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]]; however, unlike the Greeks of the Classical period, who did what we would now call basic algebra in geometrical terms, Diophantus did what we would now call basic algebraic geometry in purely algebraic terms. In modern language, what Diophantus did was to find rational parametrizations of varieties; that is, given an equation of the form (say)\n<math>f(x_1,x_2,x_3)=0</math>, his aim was to find (in essence) three [[rational functions]] <math>g_1, g_2, g_3</math> such that, for all values of <math>r</math> and <math>s</math>, setting\n<math>x_i = g_i(r,s)</math> for <math>i=1,2,3</math> gives a solution to <math>f(x_1,x_2,x_3)=0.</math>\n\nDiophantus also studied the equations of some non-rational curves, for which no rational parametrisation is possible. He managed to find some rational points on these curves ([[elliptic curve]]s, as it happens, in what seems to be their first known occurrence) by means of what amounts to a tangent construction: translated into coordinate geometry\n(which did not exist in Diophantus's time), his method would be visualised as drawing a tangent to a curve at a known rational point, and then finding the other point of intersection of the tangent with the curve; that other point is a new rational point. (Diophantus also resorted to what could be called a special case of a secant construction.)\n\nWhile Diophantus was concerned largely with rational solutions, he assumed some results on integer numbers, in particular that [[Lagrange's four-square theorem|every integer is the sum of four squares]] (though he never stated as much explicitly).\n\n====\u0100ryabha\u1e6da, Brahmagupta, Bh\u0101skara====\nWhile Greek astronomy probably influenced Indian learning, to the point of introducing trigonometry,{{sfn|Plofker|2008|p=119}} it seems to be the case that Indian mathematics is otherwise an indigenous tradition;<ref name=\"Plofbab\">Any early contact between Babylonian and Indian mathematics remains conjectural {{harv|Plofker|2008|p=42}}.</ref> in particular, there is no evidence that Euclid's Elements reached India before the 18th century.{{sfn|Mumford|2010|p=387}}\n\n[[Aryabhata|\u0100ryabha\u1e6da]] (476\u2013550 CE) showed that pairs of simultaneous congruences <math>n\\equiv a_1 \\bmod m_1</math>, <math>n\\equiv a_2 \\bmod m_2</math> could be solved by a method he called ''ku\u1e6d\u1e6daka'', or ''pulveriser'';<ref>\u0100ryabha\u1e6da, \u0100ryabhat\u012bya, Chapter 2, verses 32\u201333, cited in: {{harvnb|Plofker|2008|pp=134\u201340}}. See also {{harvnb|Clark|1930|pp=42\u201350}}. A slightly more explicit description of the ku\u1e6d\u1e6daka was later given in [[Brahmagupta]], ''Br\u0101hmasphu\u1e6dasiddh\u0101nta'', XVIII, 3\u20135 (in {{harvnb|Colebrooke|1817|p=325}}, cited in {{harvnb|Clark|1930|p=42}}).</ref> this is a procedure close to (a generalisation of) the [[Euclidean algorithm]], which was probably discovered independently in India.{{sfn|Mumford|2010|p=388}} \u0100ryabha\u1e6da seems to have had in mind applications to astronomical calculations.{{sfn|Plofker|2008|p=119}}\n\n[[Brahmagupta]] (628 CE) started the systematic study of indefinite quadratic equations\u2014in particular, the misnamed [[Pell's equation|Pell equation]], in which [[Archimedes]] may have first been interested, and which did not start to be solved in the West until the time of Fermat and Euler. Later Sanskrit authors would follow, using Brahmagupta's technical terminology. A general procedure (the [[Chakravala method|chakravala]], or \"cyclic method\") for solving Pell's equation was finally found by Jayadeva (cited in the eleventh century; his work is otherwise lost); the earliest surviving exposition appears in [[Bh\u0101skara II]]'s B\u012bja-ga\u1e47ita (twelfth century).{{sfn|Plofker|2008|p=194}}\n\nIndian mathematics remained largely unknown in Europe until the late eighteenth century;{{sfn|Plofker|2008|p=283}} Brahmagupta and Bh\u0101skara's work was translated into English in 1817 by [[Henry Thomas Colebrooke|Henry Colebrooke]].{{sfn|Colebrooke|1817}}\n\n====Arithmetic in the Islamic golden age====\n{{Further|Mathematics in medieval Islam}}\n\n[[File:Hevelius Selenographia frontispiece.png|upright|right|thumb|[[Al-Haytham]] seen by the West: frontispice of ''[[Selenographia]]'', showing Alhasen {{sic}} representing knowledge through reason, and Galileo representing knowledge through the senses.]]\n\nIn the early ninth century, the caliph [[Al-Ma'mun]] ordered translations of many Greek mathematical works and at least one Sanskrit work (the ''Sindhind'',\nwhich may <ref>{{harvnb|Colebrooke|1817|p=lxv}}, cited in {{harvnb|Hopkins|1990|p=302}}.

The modern proof would have been within Fermat's means (and was indeed given later by Euler), even though the modern concept of a group came long after Fermat or Euler. (It helps to know that inverses exist modulo ''p'', that is, given ''a'' not divisible by a prime ''p'', there is an integer ''x'' such that <math> x a \\equiv 1 \\bmod p</math>); this fact (which, in modern language, makes the residues mod ''p'' into a group, and which was already known to [[Aryabhata|\u0100ryabha\u1e6da]]; see [[#Indian school: \u0100ryabha\u1e6da, Brahmagupta, Bh\u0101skara|above]]) was familiar to Fermat thanks to its rediscovery by [[Claude Gaspard Bachet de M\u00e9ziriac|Bachet]] {{harv|Weil|1984|p=7}}. Weil goes on to say that Fermat would have recognised that Bachet's argument is essentially Euclid's algorithm.</ref>\n* If ''a'' and ''b'' are coprime, then <math>a^2 + b^2</math> is not divisible by any prime congruent to \u22121 modulo 4;<ref>{{harvnb|Tannery|Henry|1891|loc=Vol. II, p. 204}}, cited in {{harvnb|Weil|1984|p=63}}.

The problem was solved in a few months by Wallis and Brouncker.{{sfn|Weil|1984|p=92}} Fermat considered their solution valid, but pointed out they had provided an algorithm without a proof (as had Jayadeva and Bhaskara, though Fermat wasn't aware of this). He stated that a proof could be found by infinite descent.\n* Fermat stated and proved (by infinite descent) in the appendix to ''Observations on Diophantus'' (Obs.

A conventional starting point for analytic number theory is [[Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions]] (1837),{{sfn|Apostol|1976|p=7}} {{sfn|Davenport|Montgomery|2000|p=1}} whose proof introduced [[L-functions]] and involved some asymptotic analysis and a limiting process on a real variable.<ref>See the proof in {{harvnb|Davenport|Montgomery|2000|loc=section 1}}</ref> The first use of analytic ideas in number theory actually\ngoes back to Euler (1730s),{{sfn|Iwaniec|Kowalski|2004|p=1}} {{sfn|Varadarajan|2006|loc=sections 2.5, 3.1 and 6.1}} who used formal power series and non-rigorous (or implicit) limiting arguments. The use of ''complex'' analysis in number theory comes later: the work of [[Bernhard Riemann]] (1859) on the [[Riemann zeta function|zeta function]] is the canonical starting point;{{sfn|Granville|2008|pp=322\u201348}} [[Jacobi's four-square theorem]] (1839), which predates it, belongs to an initially different strand that has by now taken a leading role in analytic number theory ([[modular form]]s).<ref>See the comment on the importance of modularity in {{harvnb|Iwaniec|Kowalski|2004|p=1}}</ref>\n\nThe history of each subfield is briefly addressed in its own section below; see the main article of each subfield for fuller treatments. Many of the most interesting questions in each area remain open and are being actively worked on.\n\n==Main subdivisions==\n===Elementary tools===\nThe term ''[[elementary proof|elementary]]'' generally denotes a method that does not use [[complex analysis]]. For example, the [[prime number theorem]] was first proven using complex analysis in 1896, but an elementary proof was found only in 1949 by [[Paul Erd\u0151s|Erd\u0151s]] and [[Atle Selberg|Selberg]].{{sfn|Goldfeld|2003}} The term is somewhat ambiguous: for example, proofs based on complex [[Tauberian theorem]]s (for example, [[Wiener\u2013Ikehara theorem|Wiener\u2013Ikehara]]) are often seen as quite enlightening but not elementary, in spite of using Fourier analysis, rather than complex analysis as such. Here as elsewhere, an ''elementary'' proof may be longer and more difficult for most readers than a non-elementary one.\n[[File:Paul Erdos with Terence Tao.jpg|thumb|270px|Number theorists [[Paul Erd\u0151s]] and [[Terence Tao]] in 1985, when Erd\u0151s was 72 and Tao was 10.]]\nNumber theory has the reputation of being a field many of whose results can be stated to the layperson. At the same time, the proofs of these results are not particularly accessible, in part because the range of tools they use is, if anything, unusually broad within mathematics.<ref>See, for example, the initial comment in {{harvnb|Iwaniec|Kowalski|2004|p=1}}.</ref>\n\n===Analytic number theory===\n{{main|Analytic number theory}}\n\n[[Image:Complex zeta.jpg|right|thumb|[[Riemann zeta function]] \u03b6(''s'') in the [[complex plane]].

The region in grey is the standard [[fundamental domain]].]]\n\n''Analytic number theory'' may be defined\n\n* in terms of its tools, as the study of the integers by means of tools from real and complex analysis;{{sfn|Apostol|1976|p=7}} or\n* in terms of its concerns, as the study within number theory of estimates on size and density, as opposed to identities.<ref>{{harvnb|Granville|2008|loc=section 1}}: \"The main difference is that in algebraic number theory [...] one typically considers questions with answers that are given by exact formulas, whereas in analytic number theory [...] one looks for ''good approximations''.\"</ref>\n\nSome subjects generally considered to be part of analytic number theory, for example, [[sieve theory]],<ref group=\"note\">Sieve theory figures as one of the main subareas of analytic number theory in many standard treatments; see, for instance, {{harvnb|Iwaniec|Kowalski|2004}} or {{harvnb|Montgomery|Vaughan|2007}}</ref> are better covered by the second rather than the first definition: some of sieve theory, for instance, uses little analysis,<ref group=\"note\">This is the case for small sieves (in particular, some combinatorial sieves such as the [[Brun sieve]]) rather than for [[large sieve]]s; the study of the latter now includes ideas from [[harmonic analysis|harmonic]] and [[functional analysis]].</ref> yet it does belong to analytic number theory.\n\nThe following are examples of problems in analytic number theory: the [[prime number theorem]], the [[Goldbach conjecture]] (or the [[twin prime conjecture]], or the [[Hardy\u2013Littlewood conjecture]]s), the [[Waring problem]] and the [[Riemann hypothesis]]. Some of the most important tools of analytic number theory are the [[circle method]], [[sieve theory|sieve methods]] and [[L-functions]] (or, rather, the study of their properties). The theory of [[modular form]]s (and, more generally, [[automorphic forms]]) also occupies an increasingly central place in the toolbox of analytic number theory.<ref>See the remarks in the introduction to {{harvnb|Iwaniec|Kowalski|2004|p=1}}: \"However much stronger...\".</ref>\n\nOne may ask analytic questions about [[algebraic number]]s, and use analytic means to answer such questions; it is thus that algebraic and analytic number theory intersect. For example, one may define [[prime ideals]] (generalizations of [[prime number]]s in the field of algebraic numbers) and ask how many prime ideals there are up to a certain size. This question [[Landau prime ideal theorem|can be answered]] by means of an examination of [[Dedekind zeta function]]s, which are generalizations of the [[Riemann zeta function]], a key analytic object at the roots of the subject.<ref>{{harvnb|Granville|2008|loc=section 3}}: \"[Riemann] defined what we now call the Riemann zeta function [...] Riemann's deep work gave birth to our subject [...]\"</ref> This is an example of a general procedure in analytic number theory: deriving information about the distribution of a sequence (here, prime ideals or prime numbers) from the analytic behavior of an appropriately constructed complex-valued function.<ref>See, for example, {{harvnb|Montgomery|Vaughan|2007}}, p. 1.</ref>\n\n===Algebraic number theory===\n{{main|Algebraic number theory}}\n\nAn ''[[algebraic number]]'' is any complex number that is a solution to some polynomial equation <math>f(x)=0</math> with rational coefficients; for example, every solution <math>x</math> of <math>x^5 + (11/2) x^3 - 7 x^2 + 9 = 0 </math> (say) is an algebraic number. Fields of algebraic numbers are also called ''[[algebraic number field]]s'', or shortly ''[[number field]]s''. Algebraic number theory studies algebraic number fields.{{sfn|Milne|2017|p=2}} Thus, analytic and algebraic number theory can and do overlap: the former is defined by its methods, the latter by its objects of study.\n\nIt could be argued that the simplest kind of number fields (viz., quadratic fields) were already studied by Gauss, as the discussion of quadratic forms in ''Disquisitiones arithmeticae'' can be restated in terms of [[ideal (ring theory)|ideals]] and\n[[Norm (mathematics)|norms]] in quadratic fields. (A ''quadratic field'' consists of all\nnumbers of the form <math> a + b \\sqrt{d}</math>, where\n<math>a</math> and <math>b</math> are rational numbers and <math>d</math>\nis a fixed rational number whose square root is not rational.)\nFor that matter, the 11th-century [[chakravala method]] amounts\u2014in modern terms\u2014to an algorithm for finding the units of a real quadratic number field. However, neither [[Bh\u0101skara II|Bh\u0101skara]] nor Gauss knew of number fields as such.\n\nThe grounds of the subject as we know it were set in the late nineteenth century, when ''ideal numbers'', the ''theory of ideals'' and ''valuation theory'' were developed; these are three complementary ways of dealing with the lack of unique factorisation in algebraic number fields. (For example, in the field generated by the rationals\nand <math> \\sqrt{-5}</math>, the number <math>6</math> can be factorised both as <math> 6 = 2 \\cdot 3</math> and\n<math> 6 = (1 + \\sqrt{-5}) ( 1 - \\sqrt{-5})</math>; all of <math>2</math>, <math>3</math>, <math>1 + \\sqrt{-5}</math> and\n<math> 1 - \\sqrt{-5}</math>\nare irreducible, and thus, in a na\u00efve sense, analogous to primes among the integers.) The initial impetus for the development of ideal numbers (by [[Ernst Kummer|Kummer]]) seems to have come from the study of higher reciprocity laws,{{sfn|Edwards|2000|p=79}} that is, generalisations of [[quadratic reciprocity]].\n\nNumber fields are often studied as extensions of smaller number fields: a field ''L'' is said to be an ''extension'' of a field ''K'' if ''L'' contains ''K''.\n(For example, the complex numbers ''C'' are an extension of the reals ''R'', and the reals ''R'' are an extension of the rationals ''Q''.)\nClassifying the possible extensions of a given number field is a difficult and partially open problem. Abelian extensions\u2014that is, extensions ''L'' of ''K'' such that the [[Galois group]]<ref group=\"note\">The Galois group of an extension ''K/L'' consists of the operations ([[isomorphisms]]) that send elements of L to other elements of L while leaving all elements of K fixed.\nThus, for instance, ''Gal(C/R)'' consists of two elements: the identity element\n(taking every element ''x''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''iy'' of ''C'' to itself) and complex conjugation\n(the map taking each element ''x''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''iy'' to ''x''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''iy'').\nThe Galois group of an extension tells us many of its crucial properties. The study of Galois groups started with [[\u00c9variste Galois]]; in modern language, the main outcome of his work is that an equation ''f''(''x'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 can be solved by radicals\n(that is, ''x'' can be expressed in terms of the four basic operations together\nwith square roots, cubic roots, etc.) if and only if the extension of the rationals by the roots of the equation ''f''(''x'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 has a Galois group that is [[solvable group|solvable]]\nin the sense of group theory. (\"Solvable\", in the sense of group theory, is a simple property that can be checked easily for finite groups.)</ref> Gal(''L''/''K'') of ''L'' over ''K'' is an [[abelian group]]\u2014are relatively well understood.\nTheir classification was the object of the programme of [[class field theory]], which was initiated in the late 19th century (partly by [[Leopold Kronecker|Kronecker]] and [[Gotthold Eisenstein|Eisenstein]]) and carried out largely in 1900\u20131950.\n\nAn example of an active area of research in algebraic number theory is [[Iwasawa theory]]. The [[Langlands program]], one of the main current large-scale research plans in mathematics, is sometimes described as an attempt to generalise class field theory to non-abelian extensions of number fields.\n\n===Diophantine geometry===\n{{main|Diophantine geometry}}\n\nThe central problem of ''Diophantine geometry'' is to determine when a [[Diophantine equation]] has solutions, and if it does, how many. The approach taken is to think of the solutions of an equation as a geometric object.\n\nFor example, an equation in two variables defines a curve in the plane. More generally, an equation, or system of equations, in two or more variables defines a [[algebraic curve|curve]], a [[algebraic surface|surface]] or some other such object in ''n''-dimensional space. In Diophantine geometry, one asks whether there are any ''[[rational points]]'' (points all of whose coordinates are rationals) or\n''integral points'' (points all of whose coordinates are integers) on the curve or surface. If there are any such points, the next step is to ask how many there are and how they are distributed. A basic question in this direction is if there are finitely\nor infinitely many rational points on a given curve (or surface).\n\nIn the [[Pythagorean theorem|Pythagorean equation]] <math>x^2+y^2 = 1,</math>\nwe would like to study its rational solutions, that is, its solutions\n<math>(x,y)</math> such that\n''x'' and ''y'' are both rational. This is the same as asking for all integer solutions\nto <math>a^2 + b^2 = c^2</math>; any solution to the latter equation gives\nus a solution <math>x = a/c</math>, <math>y = b/c</math> to the former. It is also the\nsame as asking for all points with rational coordinates on the curve\ndescribed by <math>x^2 + y^2 = 1</math>. (This curve happens to be a circle of radius 1 around the origin.)\n\n[[Image:ECClines-3.svg|right|thumb|300px|Two examples of an [[elliptic curve]], that is, a curve\nof genus 1 having at least one rational point. (Either graph can be seen as a slice of a [[torus]] in four-dimensional space.)]]\n\nThe rephrasing of questions on equations in terms of points on curves turns out to be felicitous. The finiteness or not of the number of rational or integer points on an algebraic curve\u2014that is, rational or integer solutions to an equation <math>f(x,y)=0</math>, where <math>f</math> is a polynomial in two variables\u2014turns out to depend crucially on the ''genus'' of the curve. The ''genus'' can be defined as follows:<ref group=\"note\">If we want to study the curve <math>y^2 = x^3 + 7</math>. We allow ''x'' and ''y'' to be complex numbers: <math>(a + b i)^2 = (c + d i)^3 + 7</math>. This is, in effect, a set of two equations on four variables, since both the real\nand the imaginary part on each side must match. As a result, we get a surface (two-dimensional) in four-dimensional space. After we choose a convenient hyperplane on which to project the surface (meaning that, say, we choose to ignore the coordinate ''a''), we can\nplot the resulting projection, which is a surface in ordinary three-dimensional space. It\nthen becomes clear that the result is a [[torus]], loosely speaking, the surface of a doughnut (somewhat\nstretched). A doughnut has one hole; hence the genus is 1.</ref> allow the variables in <math>f(x,y)=0</math> to be complex numbers; then <math>f(x,y)=0</math> defines a 2-dimensional surface in (projective) 4-dimensional space (since two complex variables can be decomposed into four real variables, that is, four dimensions). If we count the number of (doughnut) holes in the surface; we call this number the ''genus'' of <math>f(x,y)=0</math>. Other geometrical notions turn out to be just as crucial.\n\nThere is also the closely linked area of [[Diophantine approximations]]: given a number <math>x</math>, then finding how well can it be approximated by rationals. (We are looking for approximations that are good relative to the amount of space that it takes to write the rational: call <math>a/q</math> (with <math>\\gcd(a,q)=1</math>) a good approximation to <math>x</math> if <math>|x-a/q|<\\frac{1}{q^c}</math>, where <math>c</math> is large.) This question is of special interest if <math>x</math> is an algebraic number. If <math>x</math> cannot be well approximated, then some equations do not have integer or rational solutions. Moreover, several concepts (especially that of [[Glossary of arithmetic and diophantine geometry#H|height]]) turn out to be critical both in Diophantine geometry and in the study of Diophantine approximations. This question is also of special interest in [[transcendental number theory]]: if a number can be better approximated than any algebraic number, then it is a [[transcendental number]]. It is by this argument that [[Pi|{{pi}}]] and [[e (mathematical constant)|e]] have been shown to be transcendental.\n\nDiophantine geometry should not be confused with the [[geometry of numbers]], which is a collection of graphical methods for answering certain questions in algebraic number theory. ''Arithmetic geometry'', however, is a contemporary term\nfor much the same domain as that covered by the term ''Diophantine geometry''. The term ''arithmetic geometry'' is arguably used\nmost often when one wishes to emphasise the connections to modern algebraic geometry (as in, for instance, [[Faltings's theorem]]) rather than to techniques in Diophantine approximations.\n\n==Other subfields==\nThe areas below date from no earlier than the mid-twentieth century, even if they are based on older material. For example, as is explained below, the matter of algorithms in number theory is very old, in some sense older than the concept of proof; at the same time, the modern study of [[computability]] dates only from the 1930s and 1940s, and [[computational complexity theory]] from the 1970s.\n\n===Probabilistic number theory===\n{{main|Probabilistic number theory}}\n\nMuch of probabilistic number theory can be seen as an important special case of the study of variables that are almost, but not quite, mutually [[statistical independence|independent]]. For example, the event that a random integer between one and a million be divisible by two and the event that it be divisible by three are almost independent, but not quite.\n\nIt is sometimes said that [[probabilistic combinatorics]] uses the fact that whatever happens with probability greater than <math>0</math> must happen sometimes; one may say with equal justice that many applications of probabilistic number theory hinge on the fact that whatever is unusual must be rare. If certain algebraic objects (say, rational or integer solutions to certain equations) can be shown to be in the tail of certain sensibly defined distributions, it follows that there must be few of them; this is a very concrete non-probabilistic statement following from a probabilistic one.\n\nAt times, a non-rigorous, probabilistic approach leads to a number of [[heuristic]] algorithms and open problems, notably [[Cram\u00e9r's conjecture]].\n\n===Arithmetic combinatorics===\n{{main|Arithmetic combinatorics|Additive number theory}}\n\nIf we begin from a fairly \"thick\" infinite set <math>A</math>, does it contain many elements in arithmetic progression: <math>a</math>,\n<math>a+b, a+2 b, a+3 b, \\ldots, a+10b</math>, say? Should it be possible to write large integers as sums of elements of <math>A</math>?\n\nThese questions are characteristic of ''arithmetic combinatorics''. This is a presently coalescing field; it subsumes ''[[additive number theory]]'' (which concerns itself with certain very specific sets <math>A</math> of arithmetic significance, such as the primes or the squares) and, arguably, some of the ''[[geometry of numbers]]'',\ntogether with some rapidly developing new material. Its focus on issues of growth and distribution accounts in part for its developing links with [[ergodic theory]], [[finite group theory]], [[model theory]], and other fields. The term ''additive combinatorics'' is also used; however, the sets <math>A</math> being studied need not be sets of integers, but rather subsets of non-commutative [[Group (mathematics)|groups]], for which the multiplication symbol, not the addition symbol, is traditionally used; they can also be subsets of [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], in which case the growth of <math>A+A</math> and <math>A</math>\u00b7<math>A</math> may be\ncompared.\n\n===Computational number theory===\n{{main|Computational number theory}}[[Image:Lehmer sieve.jpg|thumb|A [[Lehmer sieve]], which is a primitive [[digital computer]] once used for finding [[Prime number|primes]] and solving simple [[Diophantine equations]].]]While the word ''algorithm'' goes back only to certain readers of [[al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b]], careful descriptions of methods of solution are older than proofs: such methods (that is, algorithms) are as old as any recognisable mathematics\u2014ancient Egyptian, Babylonian, Vedic, Chinese\u2014whereas proofs appeared only with the Greeks of the classical period.\nAn interesting early case is that of what we now call the [[Euclidean algorithm]]. In its basic form (namely, as an algorithm for computing the [[greatest common divisor]]) it appears as Proposition 2 of Book VII in ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'', together with a proof of correctness. However, in the form that is often used in number theory (namely, as an algorithm for finding integer solutions to an equation <math>a x + b y = c</math>,\nor, what is the same, for finding the quantities whose existence is assured by the [[Chinese remainder theorem]]) it first appears in the works of [[Aryabhata#Indeterminate equations|\u0100ryabha\u1e6da]] (5th\u20136th century CE) as an algorithm called\n''ku\u1e6d\u1e6daka'' (\"pulveriser\"), without a proof of correctness.\n\nThere are two main questions: \"Can we compute this?\" and \"Can we compute it rapidly?\" Anyone can test whether a number is prime or, if it is not, split it into prime factors; doing so rapidly is another matter. We now know fast algorithms for [[primality test|testing primality]], but, in spite of much work (both theoretical and practical), no truly fast algorithm for factoring.\n\nThe difficulty of a computation can be useful: modern protocols for [[cryptography|encrypting messages]] (for example, [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]]) depend on functions that are known to all, but whose inverses are known only to a chosen few, and would take one too long a time to figure out on one's own. For example, these functions can be such that their inverses can be computed only if certain large integers are factorized. While many difficult computational problems outside number theory are known, most working encryption protocols nowadays are based on the difficulty of a few number-theoretical problems.\n\nSome things may not be computable at all; in fact, this can be proven in some instances. For instance, in 1970, it was proven, as a solution to [[Hilbert's 10th problem]], that there is no [[Turing machine]] which can solve all Diophantine equations.<ref>{{cite book | editor=Felix E.

(We would necessarily be speaking of Diophantine equations for which there are no integer solutions, since, given a Diophantine equation with at least one solution, the solution itself provides a proof of the fact that a solution exists. We cannot prove that a particular Diophantine equation is of this kind, since this would imply that it has no solutions.)\n\n==Applications==\n{{Expand section|1=<nowiki />\n* Modern applications of Number theory|date=March 2016}}\nThe number-theorist [[Leonard Dickson]] (1874\u20131954) said \"Thank God that number theory is unsullied by any application\".

German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777\u20131855) said, \"Mathematics is the queen of the sciences\u2014and number theory is the queen of mathematics.\"{{sfn|Long|1972|p=1}} Number theorists study [[prime number]]s as well as the properties of objects made out of integers (for example, [[rational number]]s) or defined as generalizations of the integers (for example, [[algebraic integer]]s). Number theory seeks to understand the properties of integer systems in spite of their apparent complexity.\n\nIntegers can be considered either in themselves or as solutions to equations ([[Diophantine geometry]]). Questions in number theory are often best understood through the study of [[Complex analysis|analytical]] objects (for example, the [[Riemann zeta function]]) that encode properties of the integers, primes or other number-theoretic objects in some fashion ([[analytic number theory]]). One may also study [[real number]]s in relation to rational numbers, for example, as approximated by the latter ([[Diophantine approximation]]).\n\nThe older term for number theory is ''arithmetic''. By the early twentieth century, it had been superseded by \"number theory\".<ref group=\"note\">Already in 1921, [[T. L. Heath]] had to explain: \"By arithmetic, Plato meant, not arithmetic in our sense, but the science which considers numbers in themselves, in other words, what we mean by the Theory of Numbers.\" {{harv|Heath|1921|p=13}}</ref> (The word \"[[arithmetic]]\" is used by the general public to mean \"[[Elementary arithmetic|elementary calculations]]\"; it has also acquired other meanings in [[mathematical logic]], as in ''[[Peano arithmetic]]'', and [[computer science]], as in ''[[floating point|floating point arithmetic]]''.) The use of the term ''arithmetic'' for ''number theory'' regained some ground in the second half of the 20th century, arguably in part due to French influence.<ref group=\"note\">Take, for example, {{harvnb|Serre|1973}}. In 1952, [[Harold Davenport|Davenport]] still had to specify that he meant ''The Higher Arithmetic''. [[G. H. Hardy|Hardy]] and Wright wrote in the introduction to ''[[An Introduction to the Theory of Numbers]]'' (1938): \"We proposed at one time to change [the title] to ''An introduction to arithmetic'', a more novel and in some ways a more appropriate title; but it was pointed out that this might lead to misunderstandings about the content of the book.\" {{harv|Hardy|Wright|2008}}</ref> In particular, ''arithmetical'' is preferred as an adjective to ''number-theoretic''.\n\n==History==\n===Origins===\n====Dawn of arithmetic====\n[[Image:Plimpton 322.jpg|right|thumb|The Plimpton 322 tablet]]\nThe earliest historical find of an arithmetical nature is a fragment of a table: the broken clay tablet [[Plimpton 322]] ([[Larsa|Larsa, Mesopotamia]], ca. 1800 BCE) contains a list of \"[[Pythagorean triples]]\", that is, integers <math>(a,b,c)</math> such that <math>a^2+b^2=c^2</math>.\nThe triples are too many and too large to have been obtained by [[brute force method|brute force]]. The heading over the first column reads: \"The ''takiltum'' of the diagonal which has been subtracted such that the width...\"<ref>{{harvnb|Neugebauer & Sachs|1945|p=40}}. The term ''takiltum'' is problematic. Robson prefers the rendering \"The holding-square of the diagonal from which 1 is torn out, so that the short side comes up...\".{{harvnb|Robson|2001|p=192}}</ref>\n\nThe table's layout suggests<ref>{{harvnb|Robson|2001|p=189}}. Other sources give the modern formula <math>(p^2-q^2,2pq,p^2+q^2)</math>. Van der Waerden gives both the modern formula and what amounts to the form preferred by Robson.{{harv|van der Waerden|1961|p=79}}</ref> that it was constructed by means of what amounts, in modern language, to the identity\n\n:<math>\\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\left(x - \\frac{1}{x}\\right)\\right)^2 + 1 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\left(x + \\frac{1}{x} \\right)\\right)^2,</math>\n\nwhich is implicit in routine Old Babylonian exercises.{{sfn|van der Waerden|1961|p=184}} If some other method was used,<ref>Neugebauer {{harv|Neugebauer|1969|pp=36\u201340}} discusses the table in detail and mentions in passing Euclid's method in modern notation {{harv|Neugebauer|1969|p=39}}.</ref> the triples were first constructed and then reordered by <math>c/a</math>, presumably for actual use as a \"table\", for example, with a view to applications.\n\nIt is not known what these applications may have been, or whether there could have been any; [[Babylonian astronomy]], for example, truly came into its own only later. It has been suggested instead that the table was a source of numerical examples for school problems.{{sfn|Friberg|1981|p=302}}<ref group=\"note\">{{harvnb|Robson|2001|p=201}}. This is controversial. See [[Plimpton 322]]. Robson's article is written polemically {{harv|Robson|2001|p=202}} with a view to \"perhaps [...] knocking [Plimpton 322] off its pedestal\" {{harv|Robson|2001|p=167}}; at the same time, it settles to the conclusion that <blockquote>[...] the question \"how was the tablet calculated?\" does not have to have the same answer as the question \"what problems does the tablet set?\" The first can be answered most satisfactorily by reciprocal pairs, as first suggested half a century ago, and the second by some sort of right-triangle problems {{harv|Robson|2001|p=202}}. </blockquote>\nRobson takes issue with the notion that the scribe who produced Plimpton 322 (who had to \"work for a living\", and would not have belonged to a \"leisured middle class\") could have been motivated by his own \"idle curiosity\" in the absence of a \"market for new mathematics\".{{harv|Robson|2001|pp=199\u2013200}}</ref>\n\nWhile Babylonian number theory\u2014or what survives of [[Babylonian mathematics]] that can be called thus\u2014consists of this single, striking fragment, Babylonian algebra (in the secondary-school sense of \"algebra\") was exceptionally well developed.{{sfn|van der Waerden|1961|p=43}} Late Neoplatonic sources<ref name=\"vanderW2\">[[Iamblichus]], ''Life of Pythagoras'',(trans., for example, {{harvnb|Guthrie|1987}}) cited in {{harvnb|van der Waerden|1961|p=108}}.

Disput. 1.17.39.</ref>\n\n[[Plato]] had a keen interest in mathematics, and distinguished clearly between arithmetic and calculation. (By ''arithmetic'' he meant, in part, theorising on number, rather than what ''arithmetic'' or ''number theory'' have come to mean.) It is through one of Plato's dialogues\u2014namely, [[Theaetetus (dialogue)|''Theaetetus'']]\u2014that we know that [[Theodorus of Cyrene|Theodorus]] had proven that <math>\\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{5}, \\dots, \\sqrt{17}</math> are irrational. [[Theaetetus of Athens|Theaetetus]] was, like Plato, a disciple of Theodorus's; he worked on distinguishing different kinds of [[Commensurability (mathematics)|incommensurables]], and was thus arguably a pioneer in the study of [[number systems]]. (Book X of [[Euclid's Elements]] is described by [[Pappus of Alexandria|Pappus]] as being largely based on Theaetetus's work.)\n\n[[Euclid]] devoted part of his ''Elements'' to prime numbers and divisibility, topics that belong unambiguously to number theory and are basic to it (Books VII to IX of [[Euclid's Elements]]). In particular, he gave an algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor of two numbers (the [[Euclidean algorithm]]; ''Elements'', Prop. VII.2) and the first known proof of the [[infinitude of primes]] (''Elements'', Prop. IX.20).\n\nIn 1773, [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]] published an [[epigram]] he had found in a manuscript during his work as a librarian; it claimed to be a letter sent by [[Archimedes]] to [[Eratosthenes]].{{sfn|Vardi|1998|pp=305\u201319}}{{sfn|Weil|1984|pp=17\u201324}} The epigram proposed what has become known as\n[[Archimedes's cattle problem]]; its solution (absent from the manuscript) requires solving an indeterminate quadratic equation (which reduces to what would later be misnamed [[Pell's equation]]). As far as we know, such equations were first successfully treated by the [[#\u0100ryabha\u1e6da, Brahmagupta, Bh\u0101skara|Indian school]]. It is not known whether Archimedes himself had a method of solution.\n\n====Diophantus====\n[[Image:Diophantus-cover.jpg|thumb|upright|Title page of the 1621 edition of Diophantus's ''Arithmetica'', translated into [[Latin]] by [[Claude Gaspard Bachet de M\u00e9ziriac]].]]\n\nVery little is known about [[Diophantus of Alexandria]]; he probably lived in the third century CE, that is, about five hundred years after Euclid. Six out of the thirteen books of Diophantus's ''[[Arithmetica]]'' survive in the original Greek; four more books survive in an Arabic translation. The ''Arithmetica'' is a collection of worked-out problems where the task is invariably to find rational solutions to a system of polynomial equations, usually of the form <math>f(x,y)=z^2</math> or <math>f(x,y,z)=w^2</math>. Thus, nowadays, we speak of ''Diophantine equations'' when we speak of polynomial equations to which rational or integer solutions must be found.\n\nOne may say that Diophantus was studying rational points, that is, points whose coordinates are rational\u2014on [[curve]]s and [[algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]]; however, unlike the Greeks of the Classical period, who did what we would now call basic algebra in geometrical terms, Diophantus did what we would now call basic algebraic geometry in purely algebraic terms. In modern language, what Diophantus did was to find rational parametrizations of varieties; that is, given an equation of the form (say)\n<math>f(x_1,x_2,x_3)=0</math>, his aim was to find (in essence) three [[rational functions]] <math>g_1, g_2, g_3</math> such that, for all values of <math>r</math> and <math>s</math>, setting\n<math>x_i = g_i(r,s)</math> for <math>i=1,2,3</math> gives a solution to <math>f(x_1,x_2,x_3)=0.</math>\n\nDiophantus also studied the equations of some non-rational curves, for which no rational parametrisation is possible. He managed to find some rational points on these curves ([[elliptic curve]]s, as it happens, in what seems to be their first known occurrence) by means of what amounts to a tangent construction: translated into coordinate geometry\n(which did not exist in Diophantus's time), his method would be visualised as drawing a tangent to a curve at a known rational point, and then finding the other point of intersection of the tangent with the curve; that other point is a new rational point. (Diophantus also resorted to what could be called a special case of a secant construction.)\n\nWhile Diophantus was concerned largely with rational solutions, he assumed some results on integer numbers, in particular that [[Lagrange's four-square theorem|every integer is the sum of four squares]] (though he never stated as much explicitly).\n\n====\u0100ryabha\u1e6da, Brahmagupta, Bh\u0101skara====\nWhile Greek astronomy probably influenced Indian learning, to the point of introducing trigonometry,{{sfn|Plofker|2008|p=119}} it seems to be the case that Indian mathematics is otherwise an indigenous tradition;<ref name=\"Plofbab\">Any early contact between Babylonian and Indian mathematics remains conjectural {{harv|Plofker|2008|p=42}}.</ref> in particular, there is no evidence that Euclid's Elements reached India before the 18th century.{{sfn|Mumford|2010|p=387}}\n\n[[Aryabhata|\u0100ryabha\u1e6da]] (476\u2013550 CE) showed that pairs of simultaneous congruences <math>n\\equiv a_1 \\bmod m_1</math>, <math>n\\equiv a_2 \\bmod m_2</math> could be solved by a method he called ''ku\u1e6d\u1e6daka'', or ''pulveriser'';<ref>\u0100ryabha\u1e6da, \u0100ryabhat\u012bya, Chapter 2, verses 32\u201333, cited in: {{harvnb|Plofker|2008|pp=134\u201340}}.

Later Sanskrit authors would follow, using Brahmagupta's technical terminology. A general procedure (the [[Chakravala method|chakravala]], or \"cyclic method\") for solving Pell's equation was finally found by Jayadeva (cited in the eleventh century; his work is otherwise lost); the earliest surviving exposition appears in [[Bh\u0101skara II]]'s B\u012bja-ga\u1e47ita (twelfth century).{{sfn|Plofker|2008|p=194}}\n\nIndian mathematics remained largely unknown in Europe until the late eighteenth century;{{sfn|Plofker|2008|p=283}} Brahmagupta and Bh\u0101skara's work was translated into English in 1817 by [[Henry Thomas Colebrooke|Henry Colebrooke]].{{sfn|Colebrooke|1817}}\n\n====Arithmetic in the Islamic golden age====\n{{Further|Mathematics in medieval Islam}}\n\n[[File:Hevelius Selenographia frontispiece.png|upright|right|thumb|[[Al-Haytham]] seen by the West: frontispice of ''[[Selenographia]]'', showing Alhasen {{sic}} representing knowledge through reason, and Galileo representing knowledge through the senses.]]\n\nIn the early ninth century, the caliph [[Al-Ma'mun]] ordered translations of many Greek mathematical works and at least one Sanskrit work (the ''Sindhind'',\nwhich may <ref>{{harvnb|Colebrooke|1817|p=lxv}}, cited in {{harvnb|Hopkins|1990|p=302}}.

According to Rashed Roshdi, Al-Karaj\u012b's contemporary [[Ibn al-Haytham]] knew{{sfn|Rashed|1980|pp=305\u201321}} what would later be called [[Wilson's theorem]].\n\n====Western Europe in the Middle Ages====\nOther than a treatise on squares in arithmetic progression by [[Fibonacci]]\u2014who traveled and studied in north Africa and Constantinople\u2014no number theory to speak of was done in western Europe during the Middle Ages. Matters started to change in Europe in the late [[Renaissance]], thanks to a renewed study of the works of Greek antiquity. A catalyst was the textual emendation and translation into Latin of Diophantus' ''[[Arithmetica]]''.<ref>[[Claude Gaspard Bachet de M\u00e9ziriac|Bachet]], 1621, following a first attempt by [[Guilielmus Xylander|Xylander]], 1575</ref>\n<!--Fibonaaci sequence, unknown author of 1486 ms, Luca Pacioli.. -->\n\n===Early modern number theory===\n====Fermat====\n[[Image:Pierre de Fermat.png|thumb|right|upright|[[Pierre de Fermat]]]]\n\n[[Pierre de Fermat]] (1607\u20131665) never published his writings; in particular, his work on number theory is contained almost entirely in letters to mathematicians and in private marginal notes.{{sfn|Weil|1984|pp=45\u201346}} In his notes and letters, he scarcely wrote any proofs - he had no models in the area.<ref>{{harvnb|Weil|1984|p=118}}.

This notation is actually much later than Fermat's; it first appears in section 1 of [[Gauss]]'s [[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]. Fermat's little theorem is a consequence of the [[Lagrange's theorem (group theory)|fact]] that the [[Order (group theory)|order]] of an element of a [[Group (mathematics)|group]] divides the [[Order (group theory)|order]] of the [[Group (mathematics)|group]]. The modern proof would have been within Fermat's means (and was indeed given later by Euler), even though the modern concept of a group came long after Fermat or Euler. (It helps to know that inverses exist modulo ''p'', that is, given ''a'' not divisible by a prime ''p'', there is an integer ''x'' such that <math> x a \\equiv 1 \\bmod p</math>); this fact (which, in modern language, makes the residues mod ''p'' into a group, and which was already known to [[Aryabhata|\u0100ryabha\u1e6da]]; see [[#Indian school: \u0100ryabha\u1e6da, Brahmagupta, Bh\u0101skara|above]]) was familiar to Fermat thanks to its rediscovery by [[Claude Gaspard Bachet de M\u00e9ziriac|Bachet]] {{harv|Weil|1984|p=7}}.

He gave a full treatment of the equation <math>a x^2 + b y^2 + c z^2 = 0</math>{{sfn|Weil|1984|pp=327\u201328}} and worked on quadratic forms along the lines later developed fully by Gauss.{{sfn|Weil|1984|pp=332\u201334}} In his old age, he was the first to prove \"Fermat's last theorem\" for <math>n=5</math> (completing work by [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]], and crediting both him and [[Sophie Germain]]).{{sfn|Weil|1984|pp=337\u201338}}\n\n[[File:Carl Friedrich Gauss.jpg|thumb|left|Carl Friedrich Gauss]]\n\nIn his ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]'' (1798), [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] (1777\u20131855) proved the law of [[quadratic reciprocity]] and developed the theory of quadratic forms (in particular, defining their composition). He also introduced some basic notation ([[congruences]]) and devoted a section to computational matters, including primality tests.{{sfn|Goldstein|Schappacher|2007|p=14}} The last section of the ''Disquisitiones'' established a link between [[roots of unity]] and number theory:\n<blockquote>The theory of the division of the circle...which is treated in sec. 7 does not belong\nby itself to arithmetic, but its principles can only be drawn from higher arithmetic.<ref>From the preface of ''Disquisitiones Arithmeticae''; the translation is taken from {{harvnb|Goldstein|Schappacher|2007|p=16}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn this way, Gauss arguably made a first foray towards both [[\u00c9variste Galois]]'s work and [[algebraic number theory]].\n\n===Maturity and division into subfields===\n[[Image:ErnstKummer.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Ernst Kummer]]]]\n[[Image:Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet.jpg|upright|left|thumb|[[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]]]]\n\nStarting early in the nineteenth century, the following developments gradually took place:\n\n* The rise to self-consciousness of number theory (or ''higher arithmetic'') as a field of study.<ref>See the discussion in section 5 of {{harvnb|Goldstein|Schappacher|2007}}. Early signs of self-consciousness are present already in letters by Fermat: thus his remarks on what number theory is, and how \"Diophantus's work [...] does not really belong to [it]\" (quoted in {{harvnb|Weil|1984|p=25}}).</ref>\n* The development of much of modern mathematics necessary for basic modern number theory: [[complex analysis]], [[group theory]], [[Galois theory]]\u2014accompanied by greater rigor in analysis and abstraction in algebra.\n* The rough subdivision of number theory into its modern subfields\u2014in particular, [[analytic number theory|analytic]] and [[algebraic number theory]].\n\nAlgebraic number theory may be said to start with the study of reciprocity and [[root of unity|cyclotomy]], but truly came into its own with the development of [[abstract algebra]] and early ideal theory and [[valuation (algebra)|valuation]] theory; see below. A conventional starting point for analytic number theory is [[Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions]] (1837),{{sfn|Apostol|1976|p=7}} {{sfn|Davenport|Montgomery|2000|p=1}} whose proof introduced [[L-functions]] and involved some asymptotic analysis and a limiting process on a real variable.<ref>See the proof in {{harvnb|Davenport|Montgomery|2000|loc=section 1}}</ref> The first use of analytic ideas in number theory actually\ngoes back to Euler (1730s),{{sfn|Iwaniec|Kowalski|2004|p=1}} {{sfn|Varadarajan|2006|loc=sections 2.5, 3.1 and 6.1}} who used formal power series and non-rigorous (or implicit) limiting arguments. The use of ''complex'' analysis in number theory comes later: the work of [[Bernhard Riemann]] (1859) on the [[Riemann zeta function|zeta function]] is the canonical starting point;{{sfn|Granville|2008|pp=322\u201348}} [[Jacobi's four-square theorem]] (1839), which predates it, belongs to an initially different strand that has by now taken a leading role in analytic number theory ([[modular form]]s).<ref>See the comment on the importance of modularity in {{harvnb|Iwaniec|Kowalski|2004|p=1}}</ref>\n\nThe history of each subfield is briefly addressed in its own section below; see the main article of each subfield for fuller treatments. Many of the most interesting questions in each area remain open and are being actively worked on.\n\n==Main subdivisions==\n===Elementary tools===\nThe term ''[[elementary proof|elementary]]'' generally denotes a method that does not use [[complex analysis]]. For example, the [[prime number theorem]] was first proven using complex analysis in 1896, but an elementary proof was found only in 1949 by [[Paul Erd\u0151s|Erd\u0151s]] and [[Atle Selberg|Selberg]].{{sfn|Goldfeld|2003}} The term is somewhat ambiguous: for example, proofs based on complex [[Tauberian theorem]]s (for example, [[Wiener\u2013Ikehara theorem|Wiener\u2013Ikehara]]) are often seen as quite enlightening but not elementary, in spite of using Fourier analysis, rather than complex analysis as such. Here as elsewhere, an ''elementary'' proof may be longer and more difficult for most readers than a non-elementary one.\n[[File:Paul Erdos with Terence Tao.jpg|thumb|270px|Number theorists [[Paul Erd\u0151s]] and [[Terence Tao]] in 1985, when Erd\u0151s was 72 and Tao was 10.]]\nNumber theory has the reputation of being a field many of whose results can be stated to the layperson. At the same time, the proofs of these results are not particularly accessible, in part because the range of tools they use is, if anything, unusually broad within mathematics.<ref>See, for example, the initial comment in {{harvnb|Iwaniec|Kowalski|2004|p=1}}.</ref>\n\n===Analytic number theory===\n{{main|Analytic number theory}}\n\n[[Image:Complex zeta.jpg|right|thumb|[[Riemann zeta function]] \u03b6(''s'') in the [[complex plane]].

The region in grey is the standard [[fundamental domain]].]]\n\n''Analytic number theory'' may be defined\n\n* in terms of its tools, as the study of the integers by means of tools from real and complex analysis;{{sfn|Apostol|1976|p=7}} or\n* in terms of its concerns, as the study within number theory of estimates on size and density, as opposed to identities.<ref>{{harvnb|Granville|2008|loc=section 1}}: \"The main difference is that in algebraic number theory [...] one typically considers questions with answers that are given by exact formulas, whereas in analytic number theory [...] one looks for ''good approximations''.\"</ref>\n\nSome subjects generally considered to be part of analytic number theory, for example, [[sieve theory]],<ref group=\"note\">Sieve theory figures as one of the main subareas of analytic number theory in many standard treatments; see, for instance, {{harvnb|Iwaniec|Kowalski|2004}} or {{harvnb|Montgomery|Vaughan|2007}}</ref> are better covered by the second rather than the first definition: some of sieve theory, for instance, uses little analysis,<ref group=\"note\">This is the case for small sieves (in particular, some combinatorial sieves such as the [[Brun sieve]]) rather than for [[large sieve]]s; the study of the latter now includes ideas from [[harmonic analysis|harmonic]] and [[functional analysis]].</ref> yet it does belong to analytic number theory.\n\nThe following are examples of problems in analytic number theory: the [[prime number theorem]], the [[Goldbach conjecture]] (or the [[twin prime conjecture]], or the [[Hardy\u2013Littlewood conjecture]]s), the [[Waring problem]] and the [[Riemann hypothesis]]. Some of the most important tools of analytic number theory are the [[circle method]], [[sieve theory|sieve methods]] and [[L-functions]] (or, rather, the study of their properties). The theory of [[modular form]]s (and, more generally, [[automorphic forms]]) also occupies an increasingly central place in the toolbox of analytic number theory.<ref>See the remarks in the introduction to {{harvnb|Iwaniec|Kowalski|2004|p=1}}: \"However much stronger...\".</ref>\n\nOne may ask analytic questions about [[algebraic number]]s, and use analytic means to answer such questions; it is thus that algebraic and analytic number theory intersect. For example, one may define [[prime ideals]] (generalizations of [[prime number]]s in the field of algebraic numbers) and ask how many prime ideals there are up to a certain size. This question [[Landau prime ideal theorem|can be answered]] by means of an examination of [[Dedekind zeta function]]s, which are generalizations of the [[Riemann zeta function]], a key analytic object at the roots of the subject.<ref>{{harvnb|Granville|2008|loc=section 3}}: \"[Riemann] defined what we now call the Riemann zeta function [...] Riemann's deep work gave birth to our subject [...]\"</ref> This is an example of a general procedure in analytic number theory: deriving information about the distribution of a sequence (here, prime ideals or prime numbers) from the analytic behavior of an appropriately constructed complex-valued function.<ref>See, for example, {{harvnb|Montgomery|Vaughan|2007}}, p. 1.</ref>\n\n===Algebraic number theory===\n{{main|Algebraic number theory}}\n\nAn ''[[algebraic number]]'' is any complex number that is a solution to some polynomial equation <math>f(x)=0</math> with rational coefficients; for example, every solution <math>x</math> of <math>x^5 + (11/2) x^3 - 7 x^2 + 9 = 0 </math> (say) is an algebraic number. Fields of algebraic numbers are also called ''[[algebraic number field]]s'', or shortly ''[[number field]]s''. Algebraic number theory studies algebraic number fields.{{sfn|Milne|2017|p=2}} Thus, analytic and algebraic number theory can and do overlap: the former is defined by its methods, the latter by its objects of study.\n\nIt could be argued that the simplest kind of number fields (viz., quadratic fields) were already studied by Gauss, as the discussion of quadratic forms in ''Disquisitiones arithmeticae'' can be restated in terms of [[ideal (ring theory)|ideals]] and\n[[Norm (mathematics)|norms]] in quadratic fields. (A ''quadratic field'' consists of all\nnumbers of the form <math> a + b \\sqrt{d}</math>, where\n<math>a</math> and <math>b</math> are rational numbers and <math>d</math>\nis a fixed rational number whose square root is not rational.)\nFor that matter, the 11th-century [[chakravala method]] amounts\u2014in modern terms\u2014to an algorithm for finding the units of a real quadratic number field. However, neither [[Bh\u0101skara II|Bh\u0101skara]] nor Gauss knew of number fields as such.\n\nThe grounds of the subject as we know it were set in the late nineteenth century, when ''ideal numbers'', the ''theory of ideals'' and ''valuation theory'' were developed; these are three complementary ways of dealing with the lack of unique factorisation in algebraic number fields. (For example, in the field generated by the rationals\nand <math> \\sqrt{-5}</math>, the number <math>6</math> can be factorised both as <math> 6 = 2 \\cdot 3</math> and\n<math> 6 = (1 + \\sqrt{-5}) ( 1 - \\sqrt{-5})</math>; all of <math>2</math>, <math>3</math>, <math>1 + \\sqrt{-5}</math> and\n<math> 1 - \\sqrt{-5}</math>\nare irreducible, and thus, in a na\u00efve sense, analogous to primes among the integers.) The initial impetus for the development of ideal numbers (by [[Ernst Kummer|Kummer]]) seems to have come from the study of higher reciprocity laws,{{sfn|Edwards|2000|p=79}} that is, generalisations of [[quadratic reciprocity]].\n\nNumber fields are often studied as extensions of smaller number fields: a field ''L'' is said to be an ''extension'' of a field ''K'' if ''L'' contains ''K''.\n(For example, the complex numbers ''C'' are an extension of the reals ''R'', and the reals ''R'' are an extension of the rationals ''Q''.)\nClassifying the possible extensions of a given number field is a difficult and partially open problem. Abelian extensions\u2014that is, extensions ''L'' of ''K'' such that the [[Galois group]]<ref group=\"note\">The Galois group of an extension ''K/L'' consists of the operations ([[isomorphisms]]) that send elements of L to other elements of L while leaving all elements of K fixed.\nThus, for instance, ''Gal(C/R)'' consists of two elements: the identity element\n(taking every element ''x''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''iy'' of ''C'' to itself) and complex conjugation\n(the map taking each element ''x''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''iy'' to ''x''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''iy'').\nThe Galois group of an extension tells us many of its crucial properties. The study of Galois groups started with [[\u00c9variste Galois]]; in modern language, the main outcome of his work is that an equation ''f''(''x'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 can be solved by radicals\n(that is, ''x'' can be expressed in terms of the four basic operations together\nwith square roots, cubic roots, etc.) if and only if the extension of the rationals by the roots of the equation ''f''(''x'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 has a Galois group that is [[solvable group|solvable]]\nin the sense of group theory. (\"Solvable\", in the sense of group theory, is a simple property that can be checked easily for finite groups.)</ref> Gal(''L''/''K'') of ''L'' over ''K'' is an [[abelian group]]\u2014are relatively well understood.\nTheir classification was the object of the programme of [[class field theory]], which was initiated in the late 19th century (partly by [[Leopold Kronecker|Kronecker]] and [[Gotthold Eisenstein|Eisenstein]]) and carried out largely in 1900\u20131950.\n\nAn example of an active area of research in algebraic number theory is [[Iwasawa theory]]. The [[Langlands program]], one of the main current large-scale research plans in mathematics, is sometimes described as an attempt to generalise class field theory to non-abelian extensions of number fields.\n\n===Diophantine geometry===\n{{main|Diophantine geometry}}\n\nThe central problem of ''Diophantine geometry'' is to determine when a [[Diophantine equation]] has solutions, and if it does, how many. The approach taken is to think of the solutions of an equation as a geometric object.\n\nFor example, an equation in two variables defines a curve in the plane. More generally, an equation, or system of equations, in two or more variables defines a [[algebraic curve|curve]], a [[algebraic surface|surface]] or some other such object in ''n''-dimensional space. In Diophantine geometry, one asks whether there are any ''[[rational points]]'' (points all of whose coordinates are rationals) or\n''integral points'' (points all of whose coordinates are integers) on the curve or surface. If there are any such points, the next step is to ask how many there are and how they are distributed. A basic question in this direction is if there are finitely\nor infinitely many rational points on a given curve (or surface).\n\nIn the [[Pythagorean theorem|Pythagorean equation]] <math>x^2+y^2 = 1,</math>\nwe would like to study its rational solutions, that is, its solutions\n<math>(x,y)</math> such that\n''x'' and ''y'' are both rational. This is the same as asking for all integer solutions\nto <math>a^2 + b^2 = c^2</math>; any solution to the latter equation gives\nus a solution <math>x = a/c</math>, <math>y = b/c</math> to the former. It is also the\nsame as asking for all points with rational coordinates on the curve\ndescribed by <math>x^2 + y^2 = 1</math>. (This curve happens to be a circle of radius 1 around the origin.)\n\n[[Image:ECClines-3.svg|right|thumb|300px|Two examples of an [[elliptic curve]], that is, a curve\nof genus 1 having at least one rational point. (Either graph can be seen as a slice of a [[torus]] in four-dimensional space.)]]\n\nThe rephrasing of questions on equations in terms of points on curves turns out to be felicitous. The finiteness or not of the number of rational or integer points on an algebraic curve\u2014that is, rational or integer solutions to an equation <math>f(x,y)=0</math>, where <math>f</math> is a polynomial in two variables\u2014turns out to depend crucially on the ''genus'' of the curve. The ''genus'' can be defined as follows:<ref group=\"note\">If we want to study the curve <math>y^2 = x^3 + 7</math>. We allow ''x'' and ''y'' to be complex numbers: <math>(a + b i)^2 = (c + d i)^3 + 7</math>. This is, in effect, a set of two equations on four variables, since both the real\nand the imaginary part on each side must match. As a result, we get a surface (two-dimensional) in four-dimensional space. After we choose a convenient hyperplane on which to project the surface (meaning that, say, we choose to ignore the coordinate ''a''), we can\nplot the resulting projection, which is a surface in ordinary three-dimensional space. It\nthen becomes clear that the result is a [[torus]], loosely speaking, the surface of a doughnut (somewhat\nstretched). A doughnut has one hole; hence the genus is 1.</ref> allow the variables in <math>f(x,y)=0</math> to be complex numbers; then <math>f(x,y)=0</math> defines a 2-dimensional surface in (projective) 4-dimensional space (since two complex variables can be decomposed into four real variables, that is, four dimensions). If we count the number of (doughnut) holes in the surface; we call this number the ''genus'' of <math>f(x,y)=0</math>. Other geometrical notions turn out to be just as crucial.\n\nThere is also the closely linked area of [[Diophantine approximations]]: given a number <math>x</math>, then finding how well can it be approximated by rationals. (We are looking for approximations that are good relative to the amount of space that it takes to write the rational: call <math>a/q</math> (with <math>\\gcd(a,q)=1</math>) a good approximation to <math>x</math> if <math>|x-a/q|<\\frac{1}{q^c}</math>, where <math>c</math> is large.) This question is of special interest if <math>x</math> is an algebraic number. If <math>x</math> cannot be well approximated, then some equations do not have integer or rational solutions. Moreover, several concepts (especially that of [[Glossary of arithmetic and diophantine geometry#H|height]]) turn out to be critical both in Diophantine geometry and in the study of Diophantine approximations. This question is also of special interest in [[transcendental number theory]]: if a number can be better approximated than any algebraic number, then it is a [[transcendental number]]. It is by this argument that [[Pi|{{pi}}]] and [[e (mathematical constant)|e]] have been shown to be transcendental.\n\nDiophantine geometry should not be confused with the [[geometry of numbers]], which is a collection of graphical methods for answering certain questions in algebraic number theory. ''Arithmetic geometry'', however, is a contemporary term\nfor much the same domain as that covered by the term ''Diophantine geometry''. The term ''arithmetic geometry'' is arguably used\nmost often when one wishes to emphasise the connections to modern algebraic geometry (as in, for instance, [[Faltings's theorem]]) rather than to techniques in Diophantine approximations.\n\n==Other subfields==\nThe areas below date from no earlier than the mid-twentieth century, even if they are based on older material. For example, as is explained below, the matter of algorithms in number theory is very old, in some sense older than the concept of proof; at the same time, the modern study of [[computability]] dates only from the 1930s and 1940s, and [[computational complexity theory]] from the 1970s.\n\n===Probabilistic number theory===\n{{main|Probabilistic number theory}}\n\nMuch of probabilistic number theory can be seen as an important special case of the study of variables that are almost, but not quite, mutually [[statistical independence|independent]]. For example, the event that a random integer between one and a million be divisible by two and the event that it be divisible by three are almost independent, but not quite.\n\nIt is sometimes said that [[probabilistic combinatorics]] uses the fact that whatever happens with probability greater than <math>0</math> must happen sometimes; one may say with equal justice that many applications of probabilistic number theory hinge on the fact that whatever is unusual must be rare. If certain algebraic objects (say, rational or integer solutions to certain equations) can be shown to be in the tail of certain sensibly defined distributions, it follows that there must be few of them; this is a very concrete non-probabilistic statement following from a probabilistic one.\n\nAt times, a non-rigorous, probabilistic approach leads to a number of [[heuristic]] algorithms and open problems, notably [[Cram\u00e9r's conjecture]].\n\n===Arithmetic combinatorics===\n{{main|Arithmetic combinatorics|Additive number theory}}\n\nIf we begin from a fairly \"thick\" infinite set <math>A</math>, does it contain many elements in arithmetic progression: <math>a</math>,\n<math>a+b, a+2 b, a+3 b, \\ldots, a+10b</math>, say? Should it be possible to write large integers as sums of elements of <math>A</math>?\n\nThese questions are characteristic of ''arithmetic combinatorics''. This is a presently coalescing field; it subsumes ''[[additive number theory]]'' (which concerns itself with certain very specific sets <math>A</math> of arithmetic significance, such as the primes or the squares) and, arguably, some of the ''[[geometry of numbers]]'',\ntogether with some rapidly developing new material. Its focus on issues of growth and distribution accounts in part for its developing links with [[ergodic theory]], [[finite group theory]], [[model theory]], and other fields. The term ''additive combinatorics'' is also used; however, the sets <math>A</math> being studied need not be sets of integers, but rather subsets of non-commutative [[Group (mathematics)|groups]], for which the multiplication symbol, not the addition symbol, is traditionally used; they can also be subsets of [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], in which case the growth of <math>A+A</math> and <math>A</math>\u00b7<math>A</math> may be\ncompared.\n\n===Computational number theory===\n{{main|Computational number theory}}[[Image:Lehmer sieve.jpg|thumb|A [[Lehmer sieve]], which is a primitive [[digital computer]] once used for finding [[Prime number|primes]] and solving simple [[Diophantine equations]].]]While the word ''algorithm'' goes back only to certain readers of [[al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b]], careful descriptions of methods of solution are older than proofs: such methods (that is, algorithms) are as old as any recognisable mathematics\u2014ancient Egyptian, Babylonian, Vedic, Chinese\u2014whereas proofs appeared only with the Greeks of the classical period.\nAn interesting early case is that of what we now call the [[Euclidean algorithm]]. In its basic form (namely, as an algorithm for computing the [[greatest common divisor]]) it appears as Proposition 2 of Book VII in ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'', together with a proof of correctness. However, in the form that is often used in number theory (namely, as an algorithm for finding integer solutions to an equation <math>a x + b y = c</math>,\nor, what is the same, for finding the quantities whose existence is assured by the [[Chinese remainder theorem]]) it first appears in the works of [[Aryabhata#Indeterminate equations|\u0100ryabha\u1e6da]] (5th\u20136th century CE) as an algorithm called\n''ku\u1e6d\u1e6daka'' (\"pulveriser\"), without a proof of correctness.\n\nThere are two main questions: \"Can we compute this?\" and \"Can we compute it rapidly?\" Anyone can test whether a number is prime or, if it is not, split it into prime factors; doing so rapidly is another matter. We now know fast algorithms for [[primality test|testing primality]], but, in spite of much work (both theoretical and practical), no truly fast algorithm for factoring.\n\nThe difficulty of a computation can be useful: modern protocols for [[cryptography|encrypting messages]] (for example, [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]]) depend on functions that are known to all, but whose inverses are known only to a chosen few, and would take one too long a time to figure out on one's own. For example, these functions can be such that their inverses can be computed only if certain large integers are factorized. While many difficult computational problems outside number theory are known, most working encryption protocols nowadays are based on the difficulty of a few number-theoretical problems.\n\nSome things may not be computable at all; in fact, this can be proven in some instances. For instance, in 1970, it was proven, as a solution to [[Hilbert's 10th problem]], that there is no [[Turing machine]] which can solve all Diophantine equations.<ref>{{cite book | editor=Felix E.

(We would necessarily be speaking of Diophantine equations for which there are no integer solutions, since, given a Diophantine equation with at least one solution, the solution itself provides a proof of the fact that a solution exists. We cannot prove that a particular Diophantine equation is of this kind, since this would imply that it has no solutions.)\n\n==Applications==\n{{Expand section|1=<nowiki />\n* Modern applications of Number theory|date=March 2016}}\nThe number-theorist [[Leonard Dickson]] (1874\u20131954) said \"Thank God that number theory is unsullied by any application\".

First modeled in [[Amsterdam]] in the late 1970s where they were innocently called [[Coffeeshop (Netherlands)|coffee shops]], it would take the Americans more than a generation to successfully duplicate the idea of a retail cannabis storefront.

[[Restatement (Second) of Contracts]] \u00a7 87(1). Typically, an offeree can provide consideration for the option contract by paying money for the contract or by providing value in some other form such as by rendering other performance or [[forbearance]]. See [[consideration]] for more information.\n\n==Introduction==\nAn option is the right to convey a piece of [[property]].  The person granting the option is called the ''optionor''<ref>http://dictionary.findlaw.com/definition/optionor.html</ref> (or more usually, the ''grantor'') and the person who has the benefit of the option is called the ''optionee'' (or more usually, the ''beneficiary'').\n\nOptions characteristically exist in one of two forms:\n* '''[[Call option]]s''', which give the beneficiary the right to require the grantor to sell or convey the property to them at the agreed price on exercise\n* '''[[Put option]]s''', which give the beneficiary the right to require the grantor to buy or receive the property at the agreed price on exercise.\n\nBecause options amount to dispositions of future property, in [[common law]] countries they are normally subject to the [[rule against perpetuities]] and must be exercised within the time limits prescribed by law.\n\nIn relation to certain types of asset (principally [[Real property|land]]), in many countries an option must be registered in order to be binding on a third party.\n\n==Application of option contract in unilateral contracts==\n\nThe option contract provides an important role in [[unilateral contract]]s. In unilateral contracts, the promisor seeks acceptance by performance from the promisee. In this scenario, the classical contract view was that a contract was not formed until the performance that the promisor seeks was ''completely'' performed. This was because the consideration for the contract was the performance of the promisee. Once the promisee performed completely, consideration was satisfied and a contract was formed and only the promisor was bound to his promise.\n\nA problem arose with unilateral contracts because of the late formation of the contract. With classical unilateral contracts, a promisor can revoke his offer for the contract at any point prior to the promisee's complete performance. So, if a promisee provides 99% of the performance sought, the promisor could then revoke without any remedy for the promisee. The promisor had maximum protection and the promisee had maximum risk in this scenario.\n\nThe modern view of how option contracts apply now provides some security to the promisee in the above scenario.<ref>See \u00a7 45 of [[Restatement (Second) of Contracts]] for the [[black letter law]] of the option contract's application to this situation.</ref>  Essentially, once a promisee begins performance, an option contract is implicitly created between the promisor and the promisee. The promisor impliedly promises ''not'' to revoke the offer and the promisee impliedly promises to furnish complete performance, but as the name suggests, the promisee still retains the \"option\" of not completing performance. The consideration for this option contract is discussed in comment d of the above cited section. Basically, the consideration is provided by the promisee's beginning of performance.\n\n[[Case law]] differs from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but an option contract can either be implicitly created instantaneously at the beginning of performance (the Restatement view) or after some \"substantial performance\". ''Cook v. Coldwell Banker/Frank Laiben Realty Co.'', 967 S.W.2d 654 (Mo.

Established only four years after the nearby ''[[Great German Synagogue|Scuola Grande Tedesca]]'' (1528), it is the second oldest Venetian synagogue.{{sfn|Davis|Ravid|2001|p=43}}{{sfn|Tigay|1994|p=542}} Its origins are uncertain: it might have been constructed as a prayer room for a group of [[Provence|Proven\u00e7al]] Jews soon after their arrival in Venice, or as a private synagogue for a prominent local family. Repeatedly remodeled throughout its history, its interior is predominantly decorated in the [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]] styles.\n\nThe synagogue was most recently restored in 2016-2017 by the [[World Monuments Fund]]. It is open to the public through the Jewish Museum of Venice.\n\n==Name==\nLike the other four synagogues in Venice, the Canton Synagogue was termed a ''scuola'' (\"School\") rather than ''sinagoga'' (\"Synagogue\"), in the same way in which Ashkenazi Jews refer to the synagogue as the ''shul'' ({{Script|Hebr|\u05e9\u05d5\u05dc}}) in [[Yiddish]]. In the Venetian context, however, the term has a further connotation: ''Scuola'' was in fact the name given to Christian [[confraternity]] institutions devoted to assisting those in need, the most famous being the six [[Scuole Grandi of Venice]]. The building of the Canton Synagogue hosted indeed the headquarters of several charitable and aid organizations throughout the centuries, similarly to what happened in the adjacent ''[[Italian Synagogue (Venice)|Scuola Italiana]]''.{{sfn|Concina|Camerino|Calabi|1991|p=240}}{{sfn|Curiel|Cooperman|1990|pp=81\u201382}}\n\nAmong the several proposed etymologies for the word ''Canton'', the generally accepted one links it to the site's ancient toponym, ''canton del medras'' ([[midrash]]'s corner), referring to the building's position in the southern corner of the square of the ''Ghetto Nuovo''.{{efn|Analogously, another corner of the square was called ''canton del forno'' (bakery's corner).{{sfn|Concina|Camerino|Calabi|1991|p=105}} }} According to another hypothesis, the word derives from the Canton (or Cantoni) family which allegedly financed the synagogue's construction;{{sfn|Tigay|1994|p=542}}{{sfn|Calimani|2013}}{{sfn|Curiel|Cooperman|1990|p=58}}<ref name=\"canton\">[http://jvenice.org/en/canton-synagogue?jjj=1468490409918 Canton Synagogue].

Evidence suggests that the new synagogue might have been in fact erected by a group of [[Provence|Proven\u00e7al]] Jews soon after their arrival in Venice, in a period marked by a sharp increase in the Jewish population of Venice due to immigration from nearby countries.{{sfn|Curiel|Cooperman|1990|pp=10\u201312}}{{sfn|Sander|2000|p=513}}{{efn|The number of Jews moving into the Ghetto saw a rapid increase with the outbreak of the [[War of the League of Cambrai]], as several Jews who had settled in the Venice mainland chose to seek refuge in the city.{{sfn|Finlay|1982|p=140}} }} Proven\u00e7al Jews were forced to [[History of the Jews in Arles|leave en masse Arles]] following the annexation of Provence to France (1484), with many of them opting to settle in Italy.{{sfn|Shulvass|1973|p=7}} Several elements seem to prove the Proven\u00e7al origins of the Canton Synagogue: for instance, it was the only Venetian synagogue where the [[Lekhah Dodi]]\u2014a [[hymn]] commonly intoned by French Jews on the eve of [[Sabbath]]\u2014was sung.{{sfn|Curiel|Cooperman|1990|p=57}} Moreover, the synagogue's \"bifocal effect\" (created by the bimah and the [[Torah ark|ark]] facing each other at the opposite ends of the sanctuary), an arrangement rarely seen in old European synagogues, is a common feature of Proven\u00e7al synagogue buildings, such as those of [[Carpentras]] and [[Cavaillon]].{{sfn|Curiel|Cooperman|1990|p=57}}{{efn|The Canton Synagogue and the Cavaillon synagogue, in particular, show several similarities in their arrangements.

An anonymous exterior was an indispensable feature for synagogues built in Venice in the early decades of the sixteenth century, since Jewish places of worship\u2014although tolerated\u2014were still formally prohibited at that time.{{sfn|Concina|Camerino|Calabi|1991|p=93}} The synagogue stands on an elevated position (a feature shared with the nearby ''Scuola Grande Tedesca'' and ''Scuola Italiana'') in accordance with Talmudic precepts about synagogue architecture;{{sfn|Bleich|1977|p=63}}{{sfn|Eisenberg|2004|p=321}}{{sfn|Levy|1963|pp=29\u201334}} on a more practical note, the parcel where the building sits was owned by a prominent Venetian patrician family,{{efn|The lot of the ''Scuola Canton'' belonged to the {{Interlanguage link multi|Erizzo|it}} family; similarly, the ''Scuola Grande Tedesca'' and the ''Scuola Italiana'' were built on parcels owned by two wealthy patrician families.{{sfn|Concina|Camerino|Calabi|1991|p=95}} }} but the raised placement put the synagogue under the direct control of the Jewish community.{{sfn|Concina|Camerino|Calabi|1991|p=95}}\n\nThe first floor entrance to the synagogue building consists of a spacious and luminous [[Lobby (room)|lobby]] divided by two white [[tuscan column]]s; a stairway, lined with nineteenth-century plaques commemorating prominent members of the community, connects it to the third story synagogue. The current look of both the hall and the stairway is the result of a restoration carried out in the late 1850s.{{sfn|Curiel|Cooperman|1990|p=59}} On the third floor, the synagogue is accessed through a narrow [[Vestibule (architecture)|vestibule]] lined with benches; four windows placed on the vestibule's west wall (bricked up in 1847, and reopened in 1980) overlook the main room. The original function of such space\u2014reminiscent of the anteroom (''polish'' in Yiddish) often found in Central European synagogue buildings\u2014is not clear; however, its layout suggests that it may have initially served as a [[matroneum]]. A new raised womens' gallery was completed in 1736: from that moment on, and until 1847, the antechamber is thought to have been used by people unable to afford a seat in the main room. Due to the synagogue's modest dimensions, the number of places was in fact limited: owning a seat was considered a [[status symbol]], and seats were often handed down through generations within prominent families.{{sfn|Curiel|Cooperman|1990|p=61}}{{sfn|Ottolenghi|1932|p=12}}\n\n===Interior===\nThe synagogue benefits of plenty of natural light thanks to the eleven large windows opening to the outside.

Established only four years after the nearby ''[[Great German Synagogue|Scuola Grande Tedesca]]'' (1528), it is the second oldest Venetian synagogue.{{sfn|Davis|Ravid|2001|p=43}}{{sfn|Tigay|1994|p=542}} Its origins are uncertain: it might have been constructed as a prayer room for a group of [[Provence|Proven\u00e7al]] Jews soon after their arrival in Venice, or as a private synagogue for a prominent local family. Repeatedly remodeled throughout its history, its interior is predominantly decorated in the [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]] styles.\n\nThe synagogue was most recently restored in 2016-2017 by the [[World Monuments Fund]]. It is open to the public through the Jewish Museum of Venice.\n\n==Name==\nLike the other four synagogues in Venice, the Canton Synagogue was termed a ''scuola'' (\"School\") rather than ''sinagoga'' (\"Synagogue\"), in the same way in which Ashkenazi Jews refer to the synagogue as the ''shul'' ({{Script|Hebr|\u05e9\u05d5\u05dc}}) in [[Yiddish]]. In the Venetian context, however, the term has a further connotation: ''Scuola'' was in fact the name given to Christian [[confraternity]] institutions devoted to assisting those in need, the most famous being the six [[Scuole Grandi of Venice]]. The building of the Canton Synagogue hosted indeed the headquarters of several charitable and aid organizations throughout the centuries, similarly to what happened in the adjacent ''[[Italian Synagogue (Venice)|Scuola Italiana]]''.{{sfn|Concina|Camerino|Calabi|1991|p=240}}{{sfn|Curiel|Cooperman|1990|pp=81\u201382}}\n\nAmong the several proposed etymologies for the word ''Canton'', the generally accepted one links it to the site's ancient toponym, ''canton del medras'' ([[midrash]]'s corner), referring to the building's position in the southern corner of the square of the ''Ghetto Nuovo''.{{efn|Analogously, another corner of the square was called ''canton del forno'' (bakery's corner).{{sfn|Concina|Camerino|Calabi|1991|p=105}} }} According to another hypothesis, the word derives from the Canton (or Cantoni) family which allegedly financed the synagogue's construction;{{sfn|Tigay|1994|p=542}}{{sfn|Calimani|2013}}{{sfn|Curiel|Cooperman|1990|p=58}}<ref name=\"canton\">[http://jvenice.org/en/canton-synagogue?jjj=1468490409918 Canton Synagogue].

Evidence suggests that the new synagogue might have been in fact erected by a group of [[Provence|Proven\u00e7al]] Jews soon after their arrival in Venice, in a period marked by a sharp increase in the Jewish population of Venice due to immigration from nearby countries.{{sfn|Curiel|Cooperman|1990|pp=10\u201312}}{{sfn|Sander|2000|p=513}}{{efn|The number of Jews moving into the Ghetto saw a rapid increase with the outbreak of the [[War of the League of Cambrai]], as several Jews who had settled in the Venice mainland chose to seek refuge in the city.{{sfn|Finlay|1982|p=140}} }} Proven\u00e7al Jews were forced to [[History of the Jews in Arles|leave en masse Arles]] following the annexation of Provence to France (1484), with many of them opting to settle in Italy.{{sfn|Shulvass|1973|p=7}} Several elements seem to prove the Proven\u00e7al origins of the Canton Synagogue: for instance, it was the only Venetian synagogue where the [[Lekhah Dodi]]\u2014a [[hymn]] commonly intoned by French Jews on the eve of [[Sabbath]]\u2014was sung.{{sfn|Curiel|Cooperman|1990|p=57}} Moreover, the synagogue's \"bifocal effect\" (created by the bimah and the [[Torah ark|ark]] facing each other at the opposite ends of the sanctuary), an arrangement rarely seen in old European synagogues, is a common feature of Proven\u00e7al synagogue buildings, such as those of [[Carpentras]] and [[Cavaillon]].{{sfn|Curiel|Cooperman|1990|p=57}}{{efn|The Canton Synagogue and the Cavaillon synagogue, in particular, show several similarities in their arrangements. For example, both buildings feature a raised women's gallery which is directly connected to the prayer hall through a series of steps.{{sfn|Wischnitzer|1952|p=284}} }}\n\nThe synagogue building originally hosted both religious and social functions: the ground floor was occupied by the coffin warehouse of the ''Fraterna della Misericordia degli Hebrei Tedeschi'', a Jewish institution which provided burial services for members of the community (replaced in the nineteenth century by the ''Fraterna dei Poveri''), while the second floor housed the local [[Talmud Torah]] school (''Fraterna sive Scuola Talmud Torah di Ghetto Nuovo'').{{sfn|Concina|Camerino|Calabi|1991|p=105}}{{sfn|Davis|Ravid|2001|p=43}}\n\nThe Canton synagogue was remodeled multiple times throughout the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries, with the most important interventions taking place in the late 1630s and 1650s, 1730s, and 1770s.{{sfn|Concina|Camerino|Calabi|1991|pp=105, 107\u2013108, 113}} Along with the other synagogues of Venice, it ceased to be regularly used in October 1917, when the local Jewish community was forced to disband;{{efn|In the days of the [[Battle of Caporetto]], many Venetian Jews were transferred to [[Livorno]]\u2014another Italian city home to an important Jewish community\u2014as a precaution against an Austro-Hungarian invasion.{{sfn|Calimani|Sullam Reinisch|Vivante|2000|p=45}} }} at the same time, administration of all the Jewish places of worship was taken over by a single institution, the ''Templi Israelitici Uniti''.{{sfn|Curiel|Cooperman|1990|p=55}}\n\nStarting in 1968, the building underwent major restoration interventions operated by the [[World Monuments Fund]] and the Italian [[Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities (Italy)|Ministry for Cultural Assets and Environments]], which included stabilization of the foundations and wall insulation.{{sfn|Concina|Camerino|Calabi|1991|p=162}}{{sfn|Curiel|Cooperman|1990|p=68}} In 1989 the synagogue was finally reopened to the public, as part of a new museum area combining together all three synagogues of the ''Ghetto Nuovo'', as well as the Venice Museum of Jewish Art (established in 1953, now the Jewish Museum of Venice).{{sfn|Curiel|Cooperman|1990|pp=68, 157}} More recent conservation campaigns were carried out by the WMF in 2014 and in 2016-2017, with support from the David Berg Foundation.<ref>[https://www.wmf.org/project/schola-canton Schola Canton].

An anonymous exterior was an indispensable feature for synagogues built in Venice in the early decades of the sixteenth century, since Jewish places of worship\u2014although tolerated\u2014were still formally prohibited at that time.{{sfn|Concina|Camerino|Calabi|1991|p=93}} The synagogue stands on an elevated position (a feature shared with the nearby ''Scuola Grande Tedesca'' and ''Scuola Italiana'') in accordance with Talmudic precepts about synagogue architecture;{{sfn|Bleich|1977|p=63}}{{sfn|Eisenberg|2004|p=321}}{{sfn|Levy|1963|pp=29\u201334}} on a more practical note, the parcel where the building sits was owned by a prominent Venetian patrician family,{{efn|The lot of the ''Scuola Canton'' belonged to the {{Interlanguage link multi|Erizzo|it}} family; similarly, the ''Scuola Grande Tedesca'' and the ''Scuola Italiana'' were built on parcels owned by two wealthy patrician families.{{sfn|Concina|Camerino|Calabi|1991|p=95}} }} but the raised placement put the synagogue under the direct control of the Jewish community.{{sfn|Concina|Camerino|Calabi|1991|p=95}}\n\nThe first floor entrance to the synagogue building consists of a spacious and luminous [[Lobby (room)|lobby]] divided by two white [[tuscan column]]s; a stairway, lined with nineteenth-century plaques commemorating prominent members of the community, connects it to the third story synagogue. The current look of both the hall and the stairway is the result of a restoration carried out in the late 1850s.{{sfn|Curiel|Cooperman|1990|p=59}} On the third floor, the synagogue is accessed through a narrow [[Vestibule (architecture)|vestibule]] lined with benches; four windows placed on the vestibule's west wall (bricked up in 1847, and reopened in 1980) overlook the main room. The original function of such space\u2014reminiscent of the anteroom (''polish'' in Yiddish) often found in Central European synagogue buildings\u2014is not clear; however, its layout suggests that it may have initially served as a [[matroneum]]. A new raised womens' gallery was completed in 1736: from that moment on, and until 1847, the antechamber is thought to have been used by people unable to afford a seat in the main room. Due to the synagogue's modest dimensions, the number of places was in fact limited: owning a seat was considered a [[status symbol]], and seats were often handed down through generations within prominent families.{{sfn|Curiel|Cooperman|1990|p=61}}{{sfn|Ottolenghi|1932|p=12}}\n\n===Interior===\nThe synagogue benefits of plenty of natural light thanks to the eleven large windows opening to the outside.
