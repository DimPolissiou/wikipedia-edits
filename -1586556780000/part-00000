Health care workers may be regularly exposed to various types of illnesses and are at risk of getting sick. Disease spread can occur between a patient and a health care worker, even if the health care workers take all necessary precautions to minimize transmission, including proper hygiene and being up-to-date with vaccines. If a health care worker gets sick with a communicable disease, the possible spread may occur to other health care workers or susceptible patients within the health care facility. This can include patients with a weakened immune system and may be at risk for serious complications.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/infection-prevention/about/ipc/en/ |title=WHO {{!}} Infection prevention and control|website=WHO|access-date=2019-05-01}}</ref>\n\nHealth care workers who become infected with certain contagious agents may not be permitted to work with patients for a period of time. The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)]] has implemented several standards and directives applicable to protecting health care workers from the spread of infectious agents. These include bloodborne pathogens, personal protective equipment, and respiratory protections. The CDC has also released resource for health care facilities to assist in assessing and reducing risk for occupational exposure to infectious diseases. The purpose of these standards and guidelines is to prevent the spread of disease to others in a health care facility.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/healthcarefacilities/infectious_diseases.html |title=Safety and Health Topics {{!}} Healthcare - Infectious Diseases {{!}} Occupational Safety and Health Administration|website=www.osha.gov|access-date=2019-05-01}}</ref>\n\n== Consequences ==\nDisease isolation is rarely disputed for its importance in protecting others from disease.

Health care workers may be regularly exposed to various types of illnesses and are at risk of getting sick. Disease spread can occur between a patient and a health care worker, even if the health care workers take all necessary precautions to minimize transmission, including proper hygiene and being up-to-date with vaccines. If a health care worker gets sick with a communicable disease, the possible spread may occur to other health care workers or susceptible patients within the health care facility. This can include patients with a weakened immune system and may be at risk for serious complications.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/infection-prevention/about/ipc/en/ |title=WHO {{!}} Infection prevention and control|website=WHO|access-date=2019-05-01}}</ref>\n\nHealth care workers who become infected with certain contagious agents may not be permitted to work with patients for a period of time. The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)]] has implemented several standards and directives applicable to protecting health care workers from the spread of infectious agents. These include bloodborne pathogens, personal protective equipment, and respiratory protections. The CDC has also released resource for health care facilities to assist in assessing and reducing risk for occupational exposure to infectious diseases. The purpose of these standards and guidelines is to prevent the spread of disease to others in a health care facility.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/healthcarefacilities/infectious_diseases.html |title=Safety and Health Topics {{!}} Healthcare - Infectious Diseases {{!}} Occupational Safety and Health Administration|website=www.osha.gov|access-date=2019-05-01}}</ref>\n\n== Consequences ==\nDisease isolation is rarely disputed for its importance in protecting others from disease.

The city is close to [[Great Zimbabwe]], the national monument from which the country takes its name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://exploringafrica.matrix.msu.edu/students/curriculum/m7a/activity4.php|title=Studying Africa through the Social Studies|accessdate=18 January 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012141713/http://exploringafrica.matrix.msu.edu/students/curriculum/m7a/activity4.php|archivedate=12 October 2007}}</ref> Masvingo is close to [[Lake Mutirikwi]], its recreational park, the Kyle dam and the Kyle National Reserve where there are many different animal species. It is mostly populated by the Karanga people who form the biggest branch of the various Shona tribes in Zimbabwe.\n\n== History ==\nThe city was known as '''Fort Victoria''' until 1982, when its name was briefly changed to '''Nyanda'''. Nyanda is the name of a nearby mountain about 10 kilometers south of the town on the Masvingo to Beitbridge Road. The name was changed to Masvingo after there were protests because \"Nyanda\" means \"one who has lice.\" What's more the public sentiment was the Masvingo would be more reflective of the history of the city. \"Masvingo\" means \"fort\" in Shona and the Great Zimbabwe, which is essentially a walled fort, is often referred to as \"Masvingo eZimbabwe\" or sometime \"Masvingo eVitori,\" meaning \"the fort near Fort Victoria.\" So, within a few months its name was changed again from Nyanda to Masvingo. It is the oldest colonial settlement in Zimbabwe, and grew up around the encampment established in 1890 when the British South Africa Company \"Pioneer Column\" of the first colonist passed through on their way to what became Salisbury, now Harare. The Old Fort national monument is located in the centre of town, and was erected in 1891 as one of a series of fortifications to guard the route from [[Harare|Salisbury]] to the south. The very first [[cricket]] [[match]] in Zimbabwe is said to have taken place close by in 1890.{{citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe population was approximately 15,000 in 1970;<ref>{{cite book|last=Bridger|first=P.|author2=House, M.|year=1973|title=Encyclopaedia Rhodesia|publisher=College Press|page=448|display-authors=etal}}</ref> 30,523 in 1982 and rose to 51,743 in 1992. It had a population of approximately 58,000 in 2002 and is said to have passed the 100.000 peg in 2008. Masvingo is located {{convert|292|km|abbr=off}} south of [[Harare]]. Most of the local population belongs to the Karanga [[Shona people|Shona]] ethnic group. It is divided into suburbs including [[Mucheke]], [[Rujeko]], [[Rhodene]], [[Target Kopje]] and [[Eastvale, Zimbabwe|Eastvale]]. The suburbs are divided into high-density, middle-density and low-density suburbs. [[Mucheke]], the oldest township and [[Rujeko]] are the most populous high-density suburbs. Mucheke is also the site of the city's main bus rank as well as the stadium which is named after the ghetto. KMP and Runyararo suburbs are relatively new high and medium density suburbs beyond Mucheke. The middle-density suburbs are Eastvale located close to [[Zimuto Police Camp]] and [[Target Kopje]] located on the southern part of town on a small hill close to [[Flamboyant Hotel]]. [[Rhodene]], a low-density suburb on the northern part of the city centre, is the most affluent suburb in Masvingo. A new suburban development, Zimre Park, is also taking shape to the north east of the town along Bulawayo Road. Another suburban development is taking place close to the affluent Clipsham Park and is aptly named Clipsham Heights as it straddles the hills running parallel to the Beitbridge_Masvingo road.\n[[File:Clipsham Heights, an expansion of suburbs in Masvingo.jpg|thumb|Clipsham Heights, an expansion of suburbs in Masvingo.]]\n\n== Education ==\nMasvingo Polytechnic, [[Great Zimbabwe University]], Bondolfi Teachers College, Morgenster Teachers College and Masvingo Teachers College are the main centres of higher education in the city. The three institutes are run by the government, while Bondolfi and Morgenster are privately owned. [[Great Zimbabwe University]] grew out of what was once [[Masvingo State University]]. [[Reformed Church University]] (RCU) is another university {{convert|25|km|0|abbr=on}} south of Masvingo run by the Reformed Church of Zimbabwe. It was formerly the Great Zimbabwe University. Masvingo Teachers' College is one of the government run colleges from which Great Zimbabwe devolved. The college has still remained at the campus and the university has a new site. Other teachers' colleges around Masvingo include the Reformed Church of Zimbabwe run Morgenster Teachers' College and the Catholic run Bondolfi Teachers' College. High schools in the city include [[Victoria High School (Zimbabwe)|Victoria High School]], one of the most prestigious schools in the whole country located just north of the city centre. [[Kyle College]], Masvingo Christian High School, Ndarama High School and Mucheke High School. There are also privately run high schools commonly referred to as colleges around the city. Zimuto high school and [[Gokomere High School]], one of the most prestigious mission schools in the whole of [[Masvingo Province]] are located a few kilometres outside town.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\n== Geography ==\nThe landscape in southern Zimbabwe is relatively flat, interspersed with rounded granite mountains. Known as [[kopjes]] (Dutch: little heads), they are often quite smooth. [[Msasa]] trees dominate the savannah landscape, with the occasional baobab tree. The weather is hot and dry throughout the year, except during the summer when the rains come. There is a range of small hills to the south of the city centre. Mucheke and Shagashe rivers run close to the centre and both of them act as de facto boundaries of the central business district. Robert Mugabe way, one of the city's main streets, is lined with pine trees adjacent to some of the oldest buildings in Zimbabwe such as The victoria hotel and the building opposite to it that now houses The High Court of Zimbabwe. The tallest building is the 9-storey Zimre center located in the CBD. The Bell Tower is a historical building and formed part of the fort erected by the British South African Company in 1892 to protect settlers around Fort Victoria.\n\nThe town lies near [[Lake Mutirikwi]] and is home to a nine-hole [[golf course]] and a [[freight]] [[railway line]]. It lies on the [[Mucheke River]], with a civic centre at the town centre. [[Shagashe Game Park]] and an Italian memorial church built during [[World War II]] are nearby. Masvingo also has an [[airstrip]].

It is mostly populated by the Karanga people who form the biggest branch of the various Shona tribes in Zimbabwe.\n\n== History ==\nThe city was known as '''Fort Victoria''' until 1982, when its name was briefly changed to '''Nyanda'''. Nyanda is the name of a nearby mountain about 10 kilometers south of the town on the Masvingo to Beitbridge Road. The name was changed to Masvingo after there were protests because \"Nyanda\" means \"one who has lice.\" What's more the public sentiment was the Masvingo would be more reflective of the history of the city. \"Masvingo\" means \"fort\" in Shona and the Great Zimbabwe, which is essentially a walled fort, is often referred to as \"Masvingo eZimbabwe\" or sometime \"Masvingo eVitori,\" meaning \"the fort near Fort Victoria.\" So, within a few months its name was changed again from Nyanda to Masvingo. It is the oldest colonial settlement in Zimbabwe, and grew up around the encampment established in 1890 when the British South Africa Company \"Pioneer Column\" of the first colonist passed through on their way to what became Salisbury, now Harare. The Old Fort national monument is located in the centre of town, and was erected in 1891 as one of a series of fortifications to guard the route from [[Harare|Salisbury]] to the south. The very first [[cricket]] [[match]] in Zimbabwe is said to have taken place close by in 1890.{{citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe population was approximately 15,000 in 1970;<ref>{{cite book|last=Bridger|first=P.|author2=House, M.|year=1973|title=Encyclopaedia Rhodesia|publisher=College Press|page=448|display-authors=etal}}</ref> 30,523 in 1982 and rose to 51,743 in 1992. It had a population of approximately 58,000 in 2002 and is said to have passed the 100.000 peg in 2008. Masvingo is located {{convert|292|km|abbr=off}} south of [[Harare]]. Most of the local population belongs to the Karanga [[Shona people|Shona]] ethnic group. It is divided into suburbs including [[Mucheke]], [[Rujeko]], [[Rhodene]], [[Target Kopje]] and [[Eastvale, Zimbabwe|Eastvale]]. The suburbs are divided into high-density, middle-density and low-density suburbs. [[Mucheke]], the oldest township and [[Rujeko]] are the most populous high-density suburbs. Mucheke is also the site of the city's main bus rank as well as the stadium which is named after the ghetto. KMP and Runyararo suburbs are relatively new high and medium density suburbs beyond Mucheke. The middle-density suburbs are Eastvale located close to [[Zimuto Police Camp]] and [[Target Kopje]] located on the southern part of town on a small hill close to [[Flamboyant Hotel]]. [[Rhodene]], a low-density suburb on the northern part of the city centre, is the most affluent suburb in Masvingo. A new suburban development, Zimre Park, is also taking shape to the north east of the town along Bulawayo Road. Another suburban development is taking place close to the affluent Clipsham Park and is aptly named Clipsham Heights as it straddles the hills running parallel to the Beitbridge_Masvingo road.\n[[File:Clipsham Heights, an expansion of suburbs in Masvingo.jpg|thumb|Clipsham Heights, an expansion of suburbs in Masvingo.]]\n\n== Education ==\nMasvingo Polytechnic, [[Great Zimbabwe University]], Bondolfi Teachers College, Morgenster Teachers College and Masvingo Teachers College are the main centres of higher education in the city. The three institutes are run by the government, while Bondolfi and Morgenster are privately owned. [[Great Zimbabwe University]] grew out of what was once [[Masvingo State University]]. [[Reformed Church University]] (RCU) is another University {{convert|25|km|0|abbr=on}} south of Masvingo run by the Reformed Church of Zimbabwe. It was formerly the Great Zimbabwe University. Masvingo Teachers' College is one of the government run colleges from which Great Zimbabwe devolved. The college has still remained at the campus and the University has a new site. Other teachers' colleges around Masvingo include the Reformed Church of Zimbabwe run Morgenster Teachers' College and the Catholic run Bondolfi Teachers' College. High schools in the city include [[Victoria High School (Zimbabwe)|Victoria High School]], one of the most prestigious schools in the whole country located just north of the city centre. [[Kyle College]], Masvingo Christian High School, Ndarama High School and Mucheke High School. There are also privately run high schools commonly referred to as colleges around the city. Zimuto high school and [[Gokomere High School]], one of the most prestigious mission schools in the whole of [[Masvingo Province]] are located a few kilometres outside town.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\n== Geography ==\nThe landscape in southern Zimbabwe is relatively flat, interspersed with rounded granite mountains. Known as [[kopjes]] (Dutch: little heads), they are often quite smooth. [[Msasa]] trees dominate the savannah landscape, with the occasional baobab tree. The weather is hot and dry throughout the year, except during the summer when the rains come. There is a range of small hills to the south of the city centre. Mucheke and Shagashe rivers run close to the centre and both of them act as de facto boundaries of the central business district. Robert Mugabe way, one of the city's main streets, is lined with pine trees adjacent to some of the oldest buildings in Zimbabwe such as The victoria hotel and the building opposite to it that now houses The High Court of Zimbabwe. The tallest building is the 9-storey Zimre center located in the CBD.The Bell Tower is a historical Building and formed part of the Fort erected by the British South African Company in 1892 to protect settlers around Fort Victoria.\n\nThe town lies near [[Lake Mutirikwi]] and is home to a nine-hole [[golf course]] and a [[freight]] [[railway line]]. It lies on the [[Mucheke River]], with a civic centre at the town centre. [[Shagashe Game Park]] and an Italian memorial church built during [[World War II]] are nearby. Masvingo also has an [[airstrip]].
