wikidata|settlement_text}} of the Philippines|{{PH wikidata|settlement_text}}]] in the [[Philippine Province|province]] of {{PH wikidata|province}}, {{PH wikidata|country}}. According to the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, it has a population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people.{{PH census|current}}\n\nThe town is {{convert|31|km}} from the provincial capital of [[Iloilo City]]. The town is bordered by [[Pototan, Iloilo|Pototan]] to the west, [[Dingle, Iloilo|Dingle]] to the north-west, [[Anilao, Iloilo|Anilao]] to the north-east, and [[Dumangas]] to the south. The town is also officially known as the ''Football Capital of the Philippines''.\n\n== Barangays ==\n\nBarotac Nuevo is politically subdivided into 29 [[barangay]]s:{{PSGC detail|area}}\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* Acuit\n* Agcuyawan Calsada\n* Agcuyawan Pulo\n* Bagongbong\n* Baras\n* Bungca\n* Cabilauan\n* Cruz\n* Guintas\n* Igbong\n* Ilaud Poblacion\n* Ilaya Poblacion\n* Jalaud\n* Lagubang\n* Lanas\n* Lico-an\n* Linao\n* Monpon\n* Palaciawan\n* Patag\n* Salihid\n* So-ol\n* Sohoton\n* Tabuc-Suba\n* Tabucan\n* Talisay\n* Tinorian\n* Tiwi\n* Tubungan\n}}\n\n== History ==\nThe name ''Barotac'' is from the Spanish word ''baro'', which means ''mud'', as well as the last syllables of ''tac'' and ''lutac''. With ''nuevo'', translated as ''new'', added to the name, it distinguished it from another town called [[Barotac Viejo]] just north.\n\nAccording to local folklore, Barotac Nuevo was famous for its well-bred [[horse]]s. There was once a horse called Tamasak, a pure white stallion known for its strength, in the stead of one Don Simon, and who was offered much if he could sell it to [[Manuel Gonzales de Aguilar]], the Governor General of the country at that time. Don Simon eventually sold Tamasak. But not for money, but for title, and separation from the town of Dumangas, which it was just a smaller section thereof. The barrio once known as ''Mulatac'' now stands the town of Barotac Nuevo.\n\nBarotac Nuevo is a small town whose main industry and capital is in agriculture. The town church was built during the 16th century by [[Spanish people|Spanish]] missionaries.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census \n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Barotac Nuevo\n| 1903 = 9904\n| 1918 = 13299\n| 1939 = 20572\n| 1948 = 21860\n| 1960 = 23164\n| 1970 = 30131\n| 1975 = 33443\n| 1980 = 34276\n| 1990 = 39757\t\t\n| 1995 = 40968\n| 2000 = 45804\n| 2007 = 49515\n| 2010 = 51867\n| 2015 = 54146\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\nIn the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, the population of Barotac Nuevo was {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people,{{PH census|current}} with a density of {{convert|{{sigfig|{{PH wikidata|population_total}}/{{PH wikidata|area}}|2}}|PD/km2|disp=or}}.\n\nThe primary language spoken in Barotac Nuevo is [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]], also known as Ilonggo, and the population is predominantly [[Roman Catholic]].\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe town's agricultural output includes rice, sugar cane, and spinach. Marine products such as [[milkfish]] and [[tilapia]] are harvested from local fisheries. There are usually three annual rice harvests, depending on the season.\n\n== Sports ==\nFootball is popular in Barotac Nuevo which is usually dubbed as the football capital of the Philippines. A [[Barotac Nuevo Plaza Field|football field]] is present in the town plaza. Every summer season, a local football league is held. [[Stallion F.C.]], now named [[Stallion Laguna F.C.]] of the [[Philippines Football League]], was founded in Barotac Nuevo.

wikidata|settlement_text}} of the Philippines|{{PH wikidata|settlement_text}}]] in the [[Philippine Province|province]] of {{PH wikidata|province}}, {{PH wikidata|country}}. According to the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, it has a population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people.{{PH census|current}}\n\nThe town is {{convert|31|km}} from the provincial capital of [[Iloilo City]]. The town is bordered by [[Pototan, Iloilo|Pototan]] to the west, [[Dingle, Iloilo|Dingle]] to the north-west, [[Anilao, Iloilo|Anilao]] to the north-east, and [[Dumangas]] to the south. The town is also officially known as the ''Football Capital of the Philippines''.\n\n== Barangays ==\n\nBarotac Nuevo is politically subdivided into 29 [[barangay]]s:{{PSGC detail|area}}\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* Acuit\n* Agcuyawan Calsada\n* Agcuyawan Pulo\n* Bagongbong\n* Baras\n* Bungca\n* Cabilauan\n* Cruz\n* Guintas\n* Igbong\n* Ilaud Poblacion\n* Ilaya Poblacion\n* Jalaud\n* Lagubang\n* Lanas\n* Lico-an\n* Linao\n* Monpon\n* Palaciawan\n* Patag\n* Salihid\n* So-ol\n* Sohoton\n* Tabuc-Suba\n* Tabucan\n* Talisay\n* Tinorian\n* Tiwi\n* Tubungan\n}}\n\n== History ==\nThe name ''Barotac'' is from the Spanish word ''baro'', which means ''mud'', as well as the last syllables of ''tac'' and ''lutac''. With ''nuevo'', translated as ''new'', added to the name, it distinguished it from another town called [[Barotac Viejo]] just north.\n\nAccording to local folklore, Barotac Nuevo was famous for its well-bred [[horse]]s. There was once a horse called Tamasak, a pure white stallion known for its strength, in the stead of one Don Simon, and who was offered much if he could sell it to [[Manuel Gonzales de Aguilar]], the Governor General of the country at that time. Don Simon eventually sold Tamasak. But not for money, but for title, and separation from the town of Dumangas, which it was just a smaller section thereof. The barrio once known as ''Mulatac'' now stands the town of Barotac Nuevo.\n\nBarotac Nuevo is a small town whose main industry and capital is in agriculture. The town church was built during the 16th century by [[Spanish people|Spanish]] missionaries.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census \n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Barotac Nuevo\n| 1903 = 9904\n| 1918 = 13299\n| 1939 = 20572\n| 1948 = 21860\n| 1960 = 23164\n| 1970 = 30131\n| 1975 = 33443\n| 1980 = 34276\n| 1990 = 39757\t\t\n| 1995 = 40968\n| 2000 = 45804\n| 2007 = 49515\n| 2010 = 51867\n| 2015 = 54146\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\nIn the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, the population of Barotac Nuevo was {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people,{{PH census|current}} with a density of {{convert|{{sigfig|{{PH wikidata|population_total}}/{{PH wikidata|area}}|2}}|PD/km2|disp=or}}.\n\nThe primary language spoken in Barotac Nuevo is [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]], also known as Ilonggo, and the population is predominantly [[Roman Catholic]].\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe town's agricultural output includes rice, sugar cane, and spinach. Marine products such as [[milkfish]] and [[tilapia]] are harvested from local fisheries. There are usually three annual rice harvests, depending on the season.\n\n== Sports ==\nFootball is popular in Barotac Nuevo which is usually dubbed as the football capital of the Philippines.

His stuff was dazzling.\" Burrows then wrote Allen letters of introduction to [[Sid Caesar]], [[Phil Silvers]], and [[Peter Lind Hayes]], who immediately sent Allen a check for just the jokes Burrows included as samples.<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|541}}\n\nAs a result of the jokes Allen mailed to various writers, he was invited, then age 19, to join the NBC Writer's Development Program in 1955, followed by a job on ''The NBC Comedy Hour'' in Los Angeles. He was later hired as a full-time writer for humorist [[Herb Shriner]], initially earning $25 a week.<ref name=\"timemag\" /> He began writing scripts for ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', ''[[Tonight Starring Steve Allen|The Tonight Show]]'', specials for Sid Caesar post-''[[Caesar's Hour]]'' (1954\u20131957), and other television shows.<ref name=\"Lax Bio\" />{{sup|p.111}} By the time he was working for Caesar, he was earning $1,500 a week.

When given an assignment for a show he would leave and come back the next day with \"reams of paper\", according to producer [[Max Liebman]].<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|542}} Similarly, after he wrote for [[Bob Hope]], Hope called him \"half a genius\".<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|542}}\n\nHis daily writing routine could last as long as 15 hours, and he could focus and write anywhere necessary. [[Dick Cavett]] was amazed at Allen's capacity to write: \"He can go to a typewriter after breakfast and sit there until the sun sets and his head is pounding, interrupting work only for coffee and a brief walk, and then spend the whole evening working.\"<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|551}} When Allen wrote for other comedians, they would use eight out of ten of his jokes. When he began performing as a stand-up, he was much more selective, typically using only one out of ten jokes. He estimated that to prepare for a 30-minute show, he spent six months of intensive writing.<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|551}} He enjoyed writing, however, despite the work: \"Nothing makes me happier than to tear open a ream of paper.

His contemporaries during those years included [[Lenny Bruce]], [[Shelley Berman]], the team of [[Mike Nichols]] and [[Elaine May]], [[Joan Rivers]], [[Bill Cosby]], and [[Mort Sahl]], his personal favorite. Comedy historian [[Gerald Nachman (journalist)|Gerald Nachman]] notes that Allen, while not the first to do stand-up, would eventually have greater impact than all the others in the 1960s, and would redefine the meaning of stand-up comedy: \"He helped turn it into biting, brutally honest satirical commentary on the cultural and psychological tenor of the times.\"<ref name=\"Nachman\">{{cite book |last1=Nachman |first1=Gerland |title=Seriously Funny: The Rebel Comedians of the 1950s and 1960s |url=https://archive.org/details/seriouslyfunnyre00nach |url-access=registration |date=2003 |publisher=Pantheon |location=New York City |isbn=978-0-375-41030-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/seriouslyfunnyre00nach/page/659 659]}}</ref>{{rp|525}}\n\nAfter Allen was taken under the wing of his new manager, [[Jack Rollins (producer)|Jack Rollins]], who had recently discovered Nichols and May, Rollins suggested he perform his written jokes as a stand-up. Allen was resistant at first, but after seeing [[Mort Sahl]] on stage, he felt safer to give it a try: \"I'd never had the nerve to talk about it before. Then Mort Sahl came along with a whole new style of humor, opening up vistas for people like me.\"<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|545}} Allen made his professional stage debut at the Blue Angel nightclub in Manhattan in October 1960, where comedian [[Shelley Berman]] introduced him as a young television writer who would perform his own material.<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|545}}\n\nHis early stand-up shows with his different style of humor were not always well received or understood by his audiences. Unlike other comedians, Allen spoke to his audiences in a gentle and conversational style, often appearing to be searching for words, although he was well rehearsed. He acted \"normal\", dressed casually, and made no attempt to project a stage \"personality\". And he did not improvise: \"I put very little premium on improvisation,\" he told [[Studs Terkel]].<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|532}} His jokes were created from life experiences, and typically presented with a dead serious demeanor that made them funnier: \"I don't think my family liked me. They put a live teddy bear in my crib.\"<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|533}}\n\nThe subjects of his jokes were rarely topical, political or socially relevant. Unlike Bruce and Sahl, he did not discuss current events such as civil rights, women's rights, the Cold War, or Vietnam. And although he was described as a \"classic nebbish\", he did not tell Jewish jokes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bh.org.il/blog-items/stars-of-david-10-jewish-hollywood-icons/|title=Let There Be Laughter \u2013 Jewish Humor Around the World|last=|first=|date=|website=Beit Hatfutsot|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Comedy screenwriter [[Larry Gelbart]] compared Allen's style to [[Elaine May]]: \"He just styled himself completely after her,\" he said.<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|546}} Like [[Nichols and May]], he often made fun of intellectuals.\n\nTelevision talk show host [[Dick Cavett]], who was among the minority who quickly appreciated Allen's unique style, recalls seeing the audience at the Blue Angel mostly ignore Allen's [[monologue]]: \"I recognized immediately that there was no young comedian in the country in the same class with him for sheer brilliance of jokes, and I resented the fact that the audience was too dumb to realize what they were getting.\"<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|550}} It was his subdued stage presence, while initially unappreciated, that eventually became one of Allen's strongest traits, explains Nachman: \"The utter absence of showbiz veneer and shtick was the best shtick any comedian had ever devised. This uneasy onstage naturalness became a trademark.\"<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|530}} When he was finally noticed by the media, writers like ''The New York Times''{{'}}s [[Arthur Gelb]] described Allen's nebbish quality as [[Charlie Chaplin|\"Chaplinesque\"]] and \"refreshing\".\n\nAllen developed an anxious, nervous, and intellectual persona for his stand-up act, a successful move that secured regular gigs for him in nightclubs and on television.

He was disappointed with the final product, which inspired him to direct every film he wrote thereafter.<ref name=\"PBSdocumentary\" /> Allen's first directorial effort was ''[[What's Up, Tiger Lily?]]'' (1966, co-written with Mickey Rose), in which an existing Japanese spy movie\u2014''[[Kokusai himitsu keisatsu: Kagi no kagi]]'' (1965), \"International Secret Police: Key of Keys\"\u2014was redubbed in English by Allen and friends with fresh new, comic dialogue. In 1967 Allen played Jimmy Bond in the 007 spoof ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]''.\n\nIn 1969 Allen directed, starred in, and co-wrote (with Mickey Rose) ''[[Take the Money and Run]]'', which received positive reviews. He later signed a deal with [[United Artists]] to produce several films. Those films eventually became ''[[Bananas (film)|Bananas]]'' (1971, co-written with Rose), ''[[Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask) (film)|Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)]]'' (1972), ''[[Sleeper (1973 film)|Sleeper]]'' (1973), and ''[[Love and Death]]'' (1975).<ref name=\"PBSdocumentary\" /> ''Sleeper'' was the first of four screenplays co-written by Allen and [[Marshall Brickman]].<ref name=\"Liebenson\">{{cite web |last1=Liebenson |first1=Donald |title=The Annie Hall That Might Have Been: Inside Woody Allen's Anhedonia |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/04/annie-hall-40th-anniversary-woody-allen-carol-kane-marshall-brickman |website=vanityfair.com |accessdate=November 14, 2018 |date=April 20, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"partners\">{{cite book|last1=Stevens|first1=Matt |last2=Johnson|first2=Claudia |title=Script Partners: How to Succeed at Co-Writing for Film & TV: How to Succeed at Co-Writing for Film & TV|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LvbdCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA37|date=March 31, 2016|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-317-41792-7|pages=37\u2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1972 Allen wrote and starred in the film version of ''[[Play It Again, Sam (film)|Play It Again, Sam]]'', directed by [[Herbert Ross]] and co-starring Diane Keaton.

''Annie Hall'' (1977) won four [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress in a Leading Role]] for [[Diane Keaton]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Woody Allen. ''Annie Hall'' set the standard for modern romantic comedy and ignited a fashion trend with the clothes Keaton wore in the film. In an interview with journalist [[Katie Couric]], Keaton did not deny that Allen wrote the part for her and about her.<ref name=Couric>{{YouTube|blGicJHQZdo|\"Annie Hall Interview with Diane Keaton by Katie Couric\"}}, video interview, 2 min.</ref> The film is ranked 35th on the ''[[American Film Institute]]''{{'s}} \"100 Best Movies\" and fourth on the AFI list of the \"100 Best Comedies.\"\n\n''[[Manhattan (film)|Manhattan]]'' (1979) is a black-and-white film often viewed as an homage to New York City. As in many Allen films, the main protagonists are upper-middle class writers and academics. ''Manhattan'' focuses on the complicated relationship between middle-aged Isaac Davis (Allen) and 17-year-old Tracy ([[Mariel Hemingway]]), and co-stars Diane Keaton.\n\nKeaton, who has made eight movies with Allen, has said, \"He just has a mind like nobody else.

She also appeared briefly in ''[[Stardust Memories]]''.\n\nIn 1969, Allen cast [[Diane Keaton]] in his Broadway show ''[[Play It Again, Sam (film)|Play It Again, Sam]].'' During the run she and Allen became romantically involved. Although they broke up after a year, she continued to star in his films, including ''[[Sleeper (1973 film)|Sleeper]]'' as a futuristic poet and ''[[Love and Death]]'' as a composite character based on the novels of [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]] and [[Fyodor Dostoevsky|Dostoevsky]]. ''[[Annie Hall]]'' was very important in Allen's and Keaton's careers. It is said that the role was written for her, as Keaton's birth name was Diane Hall. She then starred in ''[[Interiors]]'' as a poet, followed by ''[[Manhattan]]''. In 1987, she had a cameo as a nightclub singer in ''[[Radio Days]]'', and she was chosen to replace [[Mia Farrow]] in ''[[Manhattan Murder Mystery]]'' after Allen and Farrow began having problems with their relationship.

His contemporaries during those years included [[Lenny Bruce]], [[Shelley Berman]], the team of [[Mike Nichols]] and [[Elaine May]], [[Joan Rivers]], [[Bill Cosby]], and [[Mort Sahl]], his personal favorite. Comedy historian [[Gerald Nachman (journalist)|Gerald Nachman]] notes that Allen, while not the first to do stand-up, would eventually have greater impact than all the others in the 1960s, and would redefine the meaning of stand-up comedy: \"He helped turn it into biting, brutally honest satirical commentary on the cultural and psychological tenor of the times.\"<ref name=\"Nachman\">{{cite book |last1=Nachman |first1=Gerland |title=Seriously Funny: The Rebel Comedians of the 1950s and 1960s |url=https://archive.org/details/seriouslyfunnyre00nach |url-access=registration |date=2003 |publisher=Pantheon |location=New York City |isbn=978-0-375-41030-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/seriouslyfunnyre00nach/page/659 659]}}</ref>{{rp|525}}\n\nAfter Allen was taken under the wing of his new manager, [[Jack Rollins (producer)|Jack Rollins]], who had recently discovered Nichols and May, Rollins suggested he perform his written jokes as a stand-up. Allen was resistant at first, but after seeing [[Mort Sahl]] on stage, he felt safer to give it a try: \"I'd never had the nerve to talk about it before. Then Mort Sahl came along with a whole new style of humor, opening up vistas for people like me.\"<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|545}} Allen made his professional stage debut at the Blue Angel nightclub in Manhattan in October 1960, where comedian [[Shelley Berman]] introduced him as a young television writer who would perform his own material.<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|545}}\n\nHis early stand-up shows with his different style of humor were not always well received or understood by his audiences. Unlike other comedians, Allen spoke to his audiences in a gentle and conversational style, often appearing to be searching for words, although he was well rehearsed. He acted \"normal\", dressed casually, and made no attempt to project a stage \"personality\". And he did not improvise: \"I put very little premium on improvisation,\" he told [[Studs Terkel]].<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|532}} His jokes were created from life experiences, and typically presented with a dead serious demeanor that made them funnier: \"I don't think my family liked me. They put a live teddy bear in my crib.\"<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|533}}\n\nThe subjects of his jokes were rarely topical, political or socially relevant. Unlike Bruce and Sahl, he did not discuss current events such as civil rights, women's rights, the Cold War, or Vietnam. And although he was described as a \"classic nebbish\", he did not tell Jewish jokes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bh.org.il/blog-items/stars-of-david-10-jewish-hollywood-icons/|title=Let There Be Laughter \u2013 Jewish Humor Around the World|last=|first=|date=|website=Beit Hatfutsot|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Comedy screenwriter [[Larry Gelbart]] compared Allen's style to [[Elaine May]]: \"He just styled himself completely after her,\" he said.<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|546}} Like [[Nichols and May]], he often made fun of intellectuals.\n\nTelevision talk show host [[Dick Cavett]], who was among the minority who quickly appreciated Allen's unique style, recalls seeing the audience at the Blue Angel mostly ignore Allen's [[monologue]]: \"I recognized immediately that there was no young comedian in the country in the same class with him for sheer brilliance of jokes, and I resented the fact that the audience was too dumb to realize what they were getting.\"<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|550}} It was his subdued stage presence, while initially unappreciated, that eventually became one of Allen's strongest traits, explains Nachman: \"The utter absence of showbiz veneer and shtick was the best shtick any comedian had ever devised.

He was disappointed with the final product, which inspired him to direct every film he wrote thereafter.<ref name=\"PBSdocumentary\" /> Allen's first directorial effort was ''[[What's Up, Tiger Lily?]]'' (1966, co-written with Mickey Rose), in which an existing Japanese spy movie\u2014''[[Kokusai himitsu keisatsu: Kagi no kagi]]'' (1965), \"International Secret Police: Key of Keys\"\u2014was redubbed in English by Allen and friends with fresh new, comic dialogue. In 1967 Allen played Jimmy Bond in the 007 spoof ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]''.\n\nIn 1969 Allen directed, starred in, and co-wrote (with Mickey Rose) ''[[Take the Money and Run]]'', which received positive reviews. He later signed a deal with [[United Artists]] to produce several films. Those films eventually became ''[[Bananas (film)|Bananas]]'' (1971, co-written with Rose), ''[[Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask) (film)|Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)]]'' (1972), ''[[Sleeper (1973 film)|Sleeper]]'' (1973), and ''[[Love and Death]]'' (1975).<ref name=\"PBSdocumentary\" /> ''Sleeper'' was the first of four screenplays co-written by Allen and [[Marshall Brickman]].<ref name=\"Liebenson\">{{cite web |last1=Liebenson |first1=Donald |title=The Annie Hall That Might Have Been: Inside Woody Allen's Anhedonia |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/04/annie-hall-40th-anniversary-woody-allen-carol-kane-marshall-brickman |website=vanityfair.com |accessdate=November 14, 2018 |date=April 20, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"partners\">{{cite book|last1=Stevens|first1=Matt |last2=Johnson|first2=Claudia |title=Script Partners: How to Succeed at Co-Writing for Film & TV: How to Succeed at Co-Writing for Film & TV|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LvbdCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA37|date=March 31, 2016|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-317-41792-7|pages=37\u2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1972 Allen wrote and starred in the film version of ''[[Play It Again, Sam (film)|Play It Again, Sam]]'', directed by [[Herbert Ross]] and co-starring Diane Keaton.

''Annie Hall'' (1977) won four [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress in a Leading Role]] for [[Diane Keaton]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Woody Allen. ''Annie Hall'' set the standard for modern romantic comedy and ignited a fashion trend with the clothes Keaton wore in the film. In an interview with journalist [[Katie Couric]], Keaton did not deny that Allen wrote the part for her and about her.<ref name=Couric>{{YouTube|blGicJHQZdo|\"Annie Hall Interview with Diane Keaton by Katie Couric\"}}, video interview, 2 min.</ref> The film is ranked 35th on the ''[[American Film Institute]]''{{'s}} \"100 Best Movies\" and fourth on the AFI list of the \"100 Best Comedies.\"\n\n''[[Manhattan (film)|Manhattan]]'' (1979) is a black-and-white film often viewed as an homage to New York City. As in many Allen films, the main protagonists are upper-middle class writers and academics. ''Manhattan'' focuses on the complicated relationship between middle-aged Isaac Davis (Allen) and 17-year-old Tracy ([[Mariel Hemingway]]), and co-stars Diane Keaton.\n\nKeaton, who has made eight movies with Allen, has said, \"He just has a mind like nobody else.

Along with a genius imagination.\"<ref name=Couric />\n\n=== 1980s ===\nAllen's 1980s films, even the comedies, have somber and philosophical undertones, and are influenced by European directors, specifically [[Ingmar Bergman]] and [[Federico Fellini]]. ''[[Stardust Memories]]'' was based on ''[[8\u00bd]]'', which it parodies, and ''[[Wild Strawberries (film)|Wild Strawberries]]''. ''[[A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy]]'' was adapted from ''[[Smiles of a Summer Night]]''. In ''[[Hannah and Her Sisters]]'', part of the film's structure and background is borrowed from ''[[Fanny and Alexander]]''. ''[[Amarcord]]'' inspired ''[[Radio Days]]''. ''[[September (1987 film)|September]]'' resembles ''[[Autumn Sonata]]''. Allen uses many elements from ''Wild Strawberries''.

''[[Manhattan Murder Mystery]]'' (1993) combined suspense with dark comedy and marked the return of [[Diane Keaton]], [[Alan Alda]] and [[Anjelica Huston]].\n\nHe returned to lighter movies like ''[[Bullets over Broadway]]'' (1994), which earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Director, followed by a musical, ''[[Everyone Says I Love You]]'' (1996). The singing and dancing scenes in ''Everyone Says I Love You'' are similar to musicals starring [[Fred Astaire]] and [[Ginger Rogers]]. The comedy ''[[Mighty Aphrodite]]'' (1995), in which Greek drama plays a large role, won an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for [[Mira Sorvino]]. Allen's 1999 jazz-based comedy-drama ''[[Sweet and Lowdown]]'' was nominated for two Academy Awards, for [[Sean Penn]] (Best Actor) and [[Samantha Morton]] (Best Supporting Actress). In contrast to these lighter movies, Allen veered into darker satire toward the end of the decade with ''[[Deconstructing Harry]]'' (1997) and ''[[Celebrity (film)|Celebrity]]'' (1998).\n\nDuring this decade Allen also starred in the television film ''[[The Sunshine Boys (1996 film)|The Sunshine Boys]]'' (1995), based on the [[Neil Simon]] [[The Sunshine Boys|play of the same name]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Evans |first1=Greg |title=Review: 'The Sunshine Boys' |url=https://variety.com/1997/tv/reviews/the-sunshine-boys-4-1200452126/|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=April 3, 2016 |date=December 21, 1997}}</ref>\n\nAllen made one sitcom \"appearance\" via telephone on the show ''[[Just Shoot Me!]]'' in a 1997 episode, \"My Dinner with Woody\", that paid tribute to several of his films.

According to Allen, the newspapers reported that she had been \"violated\".

She also appeared briefly in ''[[Stardust Memories]]''.\n\nIn 1969, Allen cast [[Diane Keaton]] in his Broadway show ''[[Play It Again, Sam (film)|Play It Again, Sam]].'' During the run she and Allen became romantically involved. Although they broke up after a year, she continued to star in his films, including ''[[Sleeper (1973 film)|Sleeper]]'' as a futuristic poet and ''[[Love and Death]]'' as a composite character based on the novels of [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]] and [[Fyodor Dostoevsky|Dostoevsky]]. ''[[Annie Hall]]'' was very important in Allen's and Keaton's careers. It is said that the role was written for her, as Keaton's birth name was Diane Hall. She then starred in ''[[Interiors]]'' as a poet, followed by ''[[Manhattan]]''. In 1987, she had a cameo as a nightclub singer in ''[[Radio Days]]'', and she was chosen to replace [[Mia Farrow]] in ''[[Manhattan Murder Mystery]]'' after Allen and Farrow began having problems with their relationship.

Early Christianity grew further apart from Judaism to establish itself as a predominantly Gentile religion, and [[Early centers of Christianity#Antioch|Antioch]] became the first Gentile Christian community with stature.<ref>Franzen, p.25</ref>\n\nThe hypothetical [[Council of Jamnia]] c. 85 is often stated to have condemned all who claimed the Messiah had already come, and Christianity in particular, excluding them from attending synagogue.<ref name=\"Wylen 1995.

It is probable that the condemnation of Jamnia included many groups, of which the Christians were but one, and did not necessarily mean excommunication. That some of the later church fathers only recommended against [[synagogue]] attendance makes it improbable that an anti-Christian prayer was a common part of the synagogue liturgy. Jewish Christians continued to worship in synagogues for centuries.<ref>Wylen (1995), p.190.</ref><ref>Wright, pp.164-165.</ref>\n\nDuring the late 1st century, Judaism was a legal religion with the protection of [[Roman law]], worked out in compromise with the Roman state over two centuries (see [[Anti-Judaism#Anti-Judaism in the Roman Empire|Anti-Judaism in the Roman Empire]] for details). In contrast, Christianity was not legalized until the 313 [[Edict of Milan]]. Observant Jews had special rights, including the privilege of abstaining from civic pagan rites. Christians were initially identified with the Jewish religion by the Romans, but as they became more distinct, Christianity became a problem for Roman rulers. Around the year 98, the emperor [[Nerva]] decreed that Christians did not have to pay the [[Fiscus Iudaicus|annual tax upon the Jews]], effectively recognizing them as distinct from [[Rabbinic Judaism]]. This opened the way to Christians being persecuted for disobedience to the emperor, as they refused to worship the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|state pantheon]].<ref name=\"Wylen 1995. Pp 190\u2013192\">Wylen (1995). pp. 190\u2013192.</ref><ref>Dunn (1999). pp. 33\u201334.</ref><ref>Boatwright (2004). p. 426.</ref>\n\nFrom c. 98 onwards a distinction between Christians and Jews in Roman literature becomes apparent. For example, [[Pliny the Younger]] postulates that Christians are not Jews since they do not pay the tax, in his letters to [[Trajan]].<ref>Wylen, pp.190-192.</ref><ref>Dunn, pp.33-34.</ref>\n\n===Later rejection of Jewish Christianity===\nJewish Christians constituted a separate community from the [[Pauline Christianity|Pauline Christians]] but maintained a similar faith, differing only in practice. In Christian circles, ''[[Nazarene (sect)|Nazarene]]'' later came to be used as a label for those faithful to Jewish law, in particular for a certain sect. These Jewish Christians, originally the central group in Christianity, generally holding the same beliefs except in their adherence to Jewish law, were not deemed heretical until the dominance of [[orthodoxy]] in the [[Christianity in the 4th century|4th century]].<ref name=\"Dauphin 1993. pp. 235, 240\u2013242\">Dauphin (1993). pp. 235, 240\u2013242.</ref> The [[Ebionites]] may have been a splinter group of Nazarenes, with disagreements over Christology and leadership. They were considered by Gentile Christians to have unorthodox beliefs, particularly in relation to their views of Christ and Gentile converts. After the condemnation of the Nazarenes, ''Ebionite'' was often used as a general pejorative for all related \"heresies\".<ref name=\"Tabor 1998\">Tabor (1998).</ref><ref>Esler (2004), pp.157\u2013159.</ref>\n\nThere was a post-Nicene \"double rejection\" of the Jewish Christians by both Gentile Christianity and Rabbinic Judaism. The true end of ancient Jewish Christianity occurred only in the 5th century.{{sfn|Dunn|1991}} Gentile Christianity became the dominant strand of orthodoxy and imposed itself on the previously Jewish Christian sanctuaries, taking full control of those houses of worship by the end of the 5th century.<ref name=\"Dauphin 1993. pp. 235, 240\u2013242\"/>{{refn|group=note|Jewish Virtual Library: \"A major difficulty in tracing the growth of Christianity from its beginnings as a [[Jewish messianism|Jewish messianic sect]], and its relations to the various other normative-Jewish, sectarian-Jewish, and Christian-Jewish groups is presented by the fact that what ultimately became normative Christianity was originally but one among various contending Christian trends. Once the \"gentile Christian\" trend won out, and the [[Pauline theology|teaching]] of [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] became accepted as expressing the doctrine of the Church, the Jewish Christian groups were pushed to the margin and ultimately excluded as heretical. Being rejected both by normative Judaism and the Church, they ultimately disappeared. Nevertheless, several Jewish Christian sects (such as the [[Nazarene (sect)|Nazarenes]], [[Ebionites]], [[Elchasaites]], and others) existed for some time, and a few of them seem to have endured for several centuries. Some sects saw in Jesus mainly a [[Prophet#Judaism|prophet]] and not the \"Christ,\" others seem to have believed in him as the Messiah, but did not draw the [[Christology|christological]] and other conclusions that subsequently became fundamental in the teaching of the Church (the divinity of the Christ, [[Trinity|trinitarian conception of the Godhead]], [[Abrogation of Old Covenant laws|abrogation of the Law]]).

Even though it is commonly thought that Paul established a Gentile church, it took centuries for a complete break to manifest. Growing tensions led to a starker separation that was virtually complete by the time Jewish Christians refused to join in the [[Bar Kokhba revolt|Bar Khokba Jewish revolt of 132]].<ref>Davidson, p.146</ref> Certain events are perceived as pivotal in the growing rift between Christianity and Judaism.\n\nThe [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|destruction of Jerusalem]] and the consequent dispersion of Jews and Jewish Christians from the city (after the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]]) ended any pre-eminence of the Jewish-Christian leadership in Jerusalem. Early Christianity grew further apart from Judaism to establish itself as a predominantly Gentile religion, and [[Early centers of Christianity#Antioch|Antioch]] became the first Gentile Christian community with stature.<ref>Franzen, p.25</ref>\n\nThe hypothetical [[Council of Jamnia]] c. 85 is often stated to have condemned all who claimed the Messiah had already come, and Christianity in particular, excluding them from attending synagogue.<ref name=\"Wylen 1995.

It is probable that the condemnation of Jamnia included many groups, of which the Christians were but one, and did not necessarily mean excommunication. That some of the later church fathers only recommended against [[synagogue]] attendance makes it improbable that an anti-Christian prayer was a common part of the synagogue liturgy. Jewish Christians continued to worship in synagogues for centuries.<ref>Wylen (1995), p.190.</ref><ref>Wright, pp.164-165.</ref>\n\nDuring the late 1st century, Judaism was a legal religion with the protection of [[Roman law]], worked out in compromise with the Roman state over two centuries (see [[Anti-Judaism#Anti-Judaism in the Roman Empire|Anti-Judaism in the Roman Empire]] for details). In contrast, Christianity was not legalized until the 313 [[Edict of Milan]]. Observant Jews had special rights, including the privilege of abstaining from civic pagan rites. Christians were initially identified with the Jewish religion by the Romans, but as they became more distinct, Christianity became a problem for Roman rulers. Around the year 98, the emperor [[Nerva]] decreed that Christians did not have to pay the [[Fiscus Iudaicus|annual tax upon the Jews]], effectively recognizing them as distinct from [[Rabbinic Judaism]]. This opened the way to Christians being persecuted for disobedience to the emperor, as they refused to worship the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|state pantheon]].<ref name=\"Wylen 1995.

For example, [[Pliny the Younger]] postulates that Christians are not Jews since they do not pay the tax, in his letters to [[Trajan]].<ref>Wylen, pp.190-192.</ref><ref>Dunn, pp.33-34.</ref>\n\n===Later rejection of Jewish Christianity===\nJewish Christians constituted a separate community from the [[Pauline Christianity|Pauline Christians]] but maintained a similar faith, differing only in practice. In Christian circles, ''[[Nazarene (sect)|Nazarene]]'' later came to be used as a label for those faithful to Jewish law, in particular for a certain sect. These Jewish Christians, originally the central group in Christianity, generally holding the same beliefs except in their adherence to Jewish law, were not deemed heretical until the dominance of [[orthodoxy]] in the [[Christianity in the 4th century|4th century]].<ref name=\"Dauphin 1993. pp. 235, 240\u2013242\">Dauphin (1993). pp. 235, 240\u2013242.</ref> The [[Ebionites]] may have been a splinter group of Nazarenes, with disagreements over Christology and leadership. They were considered by Gentile Christians to have unorthodox beliefs, particularly in relation to their views of Christ and Gentile converts. After the condemnation of the Nazarenes, ''Ebionite'' was often used as a general pejorative for all related \"heresies\".<ref name=\"Tabor 1998\">Tabor (1998).</ref><ref>Esler (2004), pp.157\u2013159.</ref>\n\nThere was a post-Nicene \"double rejection\" of the Jewish Christians by both Gentile Christianity and Rabbinic Judaism. The true end of ancient Jewish Christianity occurred only in the 5th century.{{sfn|Dunn|1991}} Gentile Christianity became the dominant strand of orthodoxy and imposed itself on the previously Jewish Christian sanctuaries, taking full control of those houses of worship by the end of the 5th century.<ref name=\"Dauphin 1993. pp. 235, 240\u2013242\"/>{{refn|group=note|Jewish Virtual Library: \"A major difficulty in tracing the growth of Christianity from its beginnings as a [[Jewish messianism|Jewish messianic sect]], and its relations to the various other normative-Jewish, sectarian-Jewish, and Christian-Jewish groups is presented by the fact that what ultimately became normative Christianity was originally but one among various contending Christian trends. Once the \"gentile Christian\" trend won out, and the [[Pauline theology|teaching]] of [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] became accepted as expressing the doctrine of the Church, the Jewish Christian groups were pushed to the margin and ultimately excluded as heretical. Being rejected both by normative Judaism and the Church, they ultimately disappeared. Nevertheless, several Jewish Christian sects (such as the [[Nazarene (sect)|Nazarenes]], [[Ebionites]], [[Elchasaites]], and others) existed for some time, and a few of them seem to have endured for several centuries. Some sects saw in Jesus mainly a [[Prophet#Judaism|prophet]] and not the \"Christ,\" others seem to have believed in him as the Messiah, but did not draw the [[Christology|christological]] and other conclusions that subsequently became fundamental in the teaching of the Church (the divinity of the Christ, [[Trinity|trinitarian conception of the Godhead]], [[Abrogation of Old Covenant laws|abrogation of the Law]]).
