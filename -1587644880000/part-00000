While still in college, Ritter traveled to the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and West Germany to perform in plays. Ritter graduated in 1970.<ref name=lipton>{{cite magazine| last=Lipton| first=Michael A.| title=Acting His Age| url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20138768,00.html| magazine=People| date=December 16, 2002| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107160642/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20138768,00.html| archivedate=November 7, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Film and television===\n[[File:John Ritter 1977.jpg|thumb|Ritter as [[Jack Tripper]], 1977]]\nRitter headlined several stage performances. After his graduation from USC in 1970, his first TV acting experience was a campus revolutionary in the TV series ''[[Dan August]]'' starring [[Burt Reynolds]] and future ''Three's Company'' co-star [[Norman Fell]]. Ritter made his film debut in the 1971 Disney film ''[[The Barefoot Executive]]''. He made guest appearances on the television series ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', and many others. He had a recurring role as the Reverend Matthew Fordwick on the drama series ''[[The Waltons]]'' from October 1972 to December 1976. Because he was not a weekly cast member, he had time to pursue other roles, which he did until December 1976, when he left for a starring role in the hit sitcom ''[[Three's Company]]'' (the Americanized version of the 1970s British [[Thames Television]] series ''[[Man About the House]]'') in 1977. In 1978, Ritter played [[Ringo Starr]]'s manager on the TV special ''[[Ringo (1978 film)|Ringo]]''. In 1982, Ritter provided the voice of Peter Dickinson in ''[[The Flight of Dragons]]''.\n\nRitter became a household name playing struggling culinary student [[Jack Tripper]] with two female roommates. Ritter co-starred opposite [[Joyce DeWitt]] and [[Suzanne Somers]], and then later [[Jenilee Harrison]] and [[Priscilla Barnes]]. Much of the comedy centered around Jack's pretending to be gay to keep the old-fashioned landlords appeased over the seemingly sordid living arrangements. The series spent several seasons near the top of the TV ratings in the U.S. before ending in 1984. A year-long spin-off ''[[Three's a Crowd]]'' ensued, as the Jack Tripper character has a live-in girlfriend and runs his own bistro. The original series has been seen continuously in reruns and is available on DVD. During the run of ''Three's Company'', Ritter appeared in the films ''[[Hero at Large]]'', ''[[Americathon]]'', and ''[[They All Laughed]]''. In 1986, he played the role of Dad in the music video for [[Graham Nash]]'s song \"Innocent Eyes\" from the [[Innocent Eyes (Graham Nash album)|album of the same name]].\n\n''[[Hooperman]]'' was Ritter's first regular television role after ''Three's Company''. Detective Harry Hooperman inherits a run-down apartment building and hires Susan Smith ([[Debrah Farentino]]) to run it. A relationship follows, and Hooperman must juggle work, love, and the antics of Bijoux the dog. In 1988, John was nominated for both an [[Emmy Award]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/john-ritter |title=John Ritter Emmy Nominated |publisher=Emmys.com |date=September 12, 2003 |accessdate=December 12, 2014}}</ref> and a [[Golden Globe Award]] for his work on ''Hooperman''. Ritter won a [[People's Choice Awards|People's Choice Award]] for this role. From 1992 to 1995, Ritter returned to television for three seasons as John Hartman, aide to a U.S. Senator in ''[[Hearts Afire]]''. This series starred [[Markie Post]] as Georgie Anne Lahti and [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Billy Bob Davis. He also played Garry Lejeune / Roger Tramplemain in the production ''Noises Off'' in 1992.\n\nAfter his time on television, he appeared in a number of movies, most notably ''[[Problem Child (film)|Problem Child]]'' and its [[Problem Child 2|first sequel]]. He played the lead role in [[Blake Edwards]]' 1989 film ''[[Skin Deep (1989 film)|Skin Deep]]'', appeared in the film version of ''[[Noises Off (film)|Noises Off]]'', rejoined Billy Bob Thornton in the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning ''[[Sling Blade]]'' (playing a kindhearted, gay, discount-store manager), and co-starred with [[Olivier Gruner]] in the 1996 action film ''Mercenary''. Ritter starred in many made-for-TV movies, including ''Gramps'' (1995), co-starring with [[Andy Griffith]], Rob Hedden's ''The Colony'' (1995) with [[Hal Linden]], [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[It (miniseries)|It]]'', ''Danielle Steel's Heartbeat'' with [[Polly Draper]], and ''[[It Came From the Sky (film)|It Came From the Sky]]'' in 1999 with [[Yasmine Bleeth]].\n\nRitter also made guest appearances on TV shows, such as ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'', ''[[Ally McBeal]],'' ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]],'' ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', and an episode of ''[[Law & Order: SVU]]'' (2002). He also provided the voice of the [[Clifford (character)|title character]] in the animated children's show ''[[Clifford the Big Red Dog (TV series)|Clifford the Big Red Dog]]'', a role for which he received four [[Daytime Emmy Award|Emmy]] nominations. His final film was ''[[Stanley's Dinosaur Round-Up]]'' (2006), an animated direct-to-DVD film based on the television series, which was dedicated to his memory.\n\nAt the time of his death he was starring in ''[[8 Simple Rules|8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter]]''.\n\n===Theater===\nRitter played Claude Pichon in ''[[The Dinner Party (play)|The Dinner Party]]'' (2000) at the [[Music Box Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], which was written by [[Neil Simon]].

While still in college, Ritter traveled to the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and West Germany to perform in plays.

After his graduation from USC in 1970, his first TV acting experience was a campus revolutionary in the TV series ''[[Dan August]]'' starring [[Burt Reynolds]] and future ''Three's Company'' co-star [[Norman Fell]]. Ritter made his film debut in the 1971 Disney film ''[[The Barefoot Executive]]''. He made guest appearances on the television series ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', and many others. He had a recurring role as the Reverend Matthew Fordwick on the drama series ''[[The Waltons]]'' from October 1972 to December 1976. Because he was not a weekly cast member, he had time to pursue other roles, which he did until December 1976, when he left for a starring role in the hit sitcom ''[[Three's Company]]'' (the Americanized version of the 1970s British [[Thames Television]] series ''[[Man About the House]]'') in 1977. In 1978, Ritter played [[Ringo Starr]]'s manager on the TV special ''[[Ringo (1978 film)|Ringo]]''. In 1982, Ritter provided the voice of Peter Dickinson in ''[[The Flight of Dragons]]''.\n\nRitter became a household name playing struggling culinary student [[Jack Tripper]] with two female roommates. Ritter co-starred opposite [[Joyce DeWitt]] and [[Suzanne Somers]], and then later [[Jenilee Harrison]] and [[Priscilla Barnes]]. Much of the comedy centered around Jack's pretending to be gay to keep the old-fashioned landlords appeased over the seemingly sordid living arrangements. The series spent several seasons near the top of the TV ratings in the U.S. before ending in 1984. A year-long spin-off ''[[Three's a Crowd]]'' ensued, as the Jack Tripper character has a live-in girlfriend and runs his own bistro. The original series has been seen continuously in reruns and is available on DVD. During the run of ''Three's Company'', Ritter appeared in the films ''[[Hero at Large]]'', ''[[Americathon]]'', and ''[[They All Laughed]]''. In 1986, he played the role of Dad in the music video for [[Graham Nash]]'s song \"Innocent Eyes\" from the [[Innocent Eyes (Graham Nash album)|album of the same name]].\n\n''[[Hooperman]]'' was Ritter's first regular television role after ''Three's Company''. Detective Harry Hooperman inherits a run-down apartment building and hires Susan Smith ([[Debrah Farentino]]) to run it. A relationship follows, and Hooperman must juggle work, love, and the antics of Bijoux the dog. In 1988, John was nominated for both an [[Emmy Award]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/john-ritter |title=John Ritter Emmy Nominated |publisher=Emmys.com |date=September 12, 2003 |accessdate=December 12, 2014}}</ref> and a [[Golden Globe Award]] for his work on ''Hooperman''. Ritter won a [[People's Choice Awards|People's Choice Award]] for this role. From 1992 to 1995, Ritter returned to television for three seasons as John Hartman, aide to a U.S. Senator in ''[[Hearts Afire]]''. This series starred [[Markie Post]] as Georgie Anne Lahti and [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Billy Bob Davis. He also played Garry Lejeune / Roger Tramplemain in the production ''Noises Off'' in 1992.\n\nAfter his time on television, he appeared in a number of movies, most notably ''[[Problem Child (film)|Problem Child]]'' and its [[Problem Child 2|first sequel]]. He played the lead role in [[Blake Edwards]]' 1989 film ''[[Skin Deep (1989 film)|Skin Deep]]'', appeared in the film version of ''[[Noises Off (film)|Noises Off]]'', rejoined Billy Bob Thornton in the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning ''[[Sling Blade]]'' (playing a kindhearted, gay, discount-store manager), and co-starred with [[Olivier Gruner]] in the 1996 action film ''Mercenary''. Ritter starred in many made-for-TV movies, including ''Gramps'' (1995), co-starring with [[Andy Griffith]], Rob Hedden's ''The Colony'' (1995) with [[Hal Linden]], [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[It (miniseries)|It]]'', ''Danielle Steel's Heartbeat'' with [[Polly Draper]], and ''[[It Came From the Sky (film)|It Came From the Sky]]'' in 1999 with [[Yasmine Bleeth]].\n\nRitter also made guest appearances on TV shows, such as ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'', ''[[Ally McBeal]],'' ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]],'' ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', and an episode of ''[[Law & Order: SVU]]'' (2002). He also provided the voice of the [[Clifford (character)|title character]] in the animated children's show ''[[Clifford the Big Red Dog (TV series)|Clifford the Big Red Dog]]'', a role for which he received four [[Daytime Emmy Award|Emmy]] nominations. His final film was ''[[Stanley's Dinosaur Round-Up]]'' (2006), an animated direct-to-DVD film based on the television series, which was dedicated to his memory.\n\nAt the time of his death he was starring in ''[[8 Simple Rules|8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter]]''.\n\n===Theater===\nRitter played Claude Pichon in ''[[The Dinner Party (play)|The Dinner Party]]'' (2000) at the [[Music Box Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], which was written by [[Neil Simon]].

The purpose of the JRF is to provide accurate information to the general public about the disease and its risk factors, provide support to individuals who have thoracic aortic disease or have lost a loved one to the disease, and improve the identification of individuals at risk for aortic dissections and the treatment of thoracic aortic disease through medical research. Yasbeck worked with the [[University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston]] (UTHealth) to establish the John Ritter Research Program in Aortic and Vascular Diseases with the goal of preventing premature deaths due to aortic dissection by identifying genetic mutations that predispose individuals to thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections.\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Film===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Some boy players worked for the adult companies and performed the female roles as women did not perform on the English stage in this period. Others worked for children's companies in which all roles, not just the female ones, were played by boys.<ref>Chambers, Vol. 2, pp. 1-76.</ref><ref>Halliday, pp. 35, 71, 98-101.</ref>\n\n==Children's companies==\nIn the [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] and [[Jacobean era|Jacobean]] periods, troupes appeared that were composed entirely of boy players. They are famously mentioned in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'', in which a group of travelling actors has left the city due to rivalry with a troupe of \"little eyases\" (II, ii, 339); the term \"eyas\" means an unfledged [[hawk]].<ref>G. Blakemore Evans, ed., ''The Riverside Shakespeare'', Boston, Houghton Mifflin, 1974; p. 1156 n. 339.</ref>\n\nThe children's companies grew out of the choirs of boy singers that had been connected with cathedrals and similar institutions since the [[Middle Ages]]. (Similar boy choirs exist to this day.) Thus the choir attached to [[St. Paul's Cathedral]] in [[London]] since the 12th century was in the 16th century molded into a company of child actors, the [[Children of Paul's]].<ref>Chambers, Vol. 2, pp. 8-22.</ref> Similar groups of boy actors were connected with other institutions, including [[Eton College|Eton]], the [[Worshipful Company of Merchant Taylors|Merchant Taylors]] School, and the ecclesiastical college at [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]].<ref>Chambers, Vol. 2, pp. 68-76.</ref>\n\nThe boys were generally in the range of 8\u201312 years old (prepubescent boys are chosen as choirboys precisely because their voices have not yet \"broken\" with puberty). They were musically talented, strictly disciplined, educated in the [[Trivium (education)|trivium]] (grammar, logic, [[rhetoric]]), and sometimes fluent in Latin.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hillebrand|first1=Harold Newcomb|title=The Child Actors: A Chapter in Elizabethan Stage History|date=1964|publisher=Russell & Russel, Inc.|location=New York|page=37}}</ref> The boys amounted to formidable competition for the companies of adult actors in Elizabethan England.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gurr|first1=Andrew|title=The Shakespearean stage 1574-1642|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge university press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780521729666|page=46|edition=Fourth}}</ref> Between 1558 and 1576 (the year [[James Burbage]] built [[The Theatre]] in London and the age of popular Elizabethan drama began), companies of boy actors performed 46 times at Court, versus only 32 times for companies of adult actors in the same period. The playwright [[John Lyly]] earned fame when his \"Euphuistic\" plays were acted at Court by the Children of Paul's in the 1260. CHUPAME EL PITO PORCO DIO LA PUTA QUE TE PARIO\n\nThe practice of children acting was never free of controversy, however (see Responses, below). Companies of child actors went out of fashion, and did not return for a decade.\n\nIn [[1600 in literature|1600]], however, the practice saw a resurgence: the [[Children of the Chapel]] performed at the private [[Blackfriars Theatre]] for much of the first decade of the 17th century.<ref>Chambers, Vol. 2, pp. 23-60.</ref> Their performances of the plays of [[Ben Jonson]] were especially popular. (The [[Globe Theatre]] was decorated with a statue of [[Hercules]], the playhouse's symbol.) The Children of Paul's were also acting publicly once again at this time.\n\nThe children probably attained their greatest notoriety during the ''Poetomachia'' or [[War of the Theatres]] ([[1599 in literature|1599]]&ndash;[[1601 in literature|1601]]). Two troupes were intimately involved on the competing sides: the Children of Paul's acted [[John Marston (poet)|John Marston]]'s ''[[Jack Drum's Entertainment]]'' (1600) and ''[[What You Will]]'' (1601) and [[Thomas Dekker (poet)|Thomas Dekker]]'s ''[[Satiromastix]]'' (1601), while the Children of the Chapel had Jonson's ''[[Cynthia's Revels]]'' (1600) and ''[[The Poetaster]]'' (1601).\n\nThe boys' troupes were strongly associated with the satirical comedy of Jonson, Marston, and [[Thomas Middleton]], which has sometimes been described as a coterie drama for gentleman \"wits\", in contrast to the popular drama of writers like Shakespeare and [[Thomas Heywood]] that was performed at the Globe and the other large public theatres. Yet the boys also played serious tragedies and contemporary histories, notably the works of [[George Chapman]] &mdash; ''[[Bussy D'Ambois]]'', ''[[The Revenge of Bussy D'Ambois]]'', and the double play ''[[The Conspiracy and Tragedy of Charles, Duke of Byron]]''. Modern readers and theatergoers can only wonder what these productions were like.   \n\nThe brand of coterie drama practiced by Jonson and others was often controversial, however; the official displeasure that greeted the play ''[[Eastward Ho]]'', which landed two of its authors in jail, also fell upon the boys who performed it. By [[1606 in literature|1606]] the Children of Paul's had ceased performing, and the Children of the Chapel were no longer associated with the Royal Chapel and had lost royal patronage; they became merely the Children of the Blackfriars. The boys' troupes had ceased public dramatic performance and the fashion died out by about 1615. The [[Lady Elizabeth's Men]] was a new company granted a patent on April 27, [[1615 in literature|1615]], under the patronage of King James' daughter [[Elizabeth of Bohemia|Princess Elizabeth]]; it was composed, to some significant degree, of veterans of the children's companies, now grown to manhood.<ref>Chambers, Vol. 2, pp. 246-60.</ref>\n\nWhile controversial in their time, the children's companies had been effective in funnelling talented, educated, and experienced young actors into the adult companies. To recapture this influence, [[Richard Gunnell]] attempted to start a children's company with 14 boys and several adults when he built the [[Salisbury Court Theatre]] in [[1629 in literature|1629]]. The enterprise was not a success, because of a long closure of the theatres due to plague soon after its inception; but it did produce [[Stephen Hammerton]], who went on to act with the King's Men, and became an early [[matinee idol]] among young women in the audience for his romantic leads.<ref>[[Andrew John Gurr|Andrew Gurr]], ''The Shakespearean Stage'', pp. 63-4</ref> \n\nA limited renewal of the practice of children's companies came in [[1637 in literature|1637]], when [[Christopher Beeston]] established, under royal warrant, the King and Queen's Young Company, colloquially called [[Beeston's Boys]]. The intent was in part to have a structure for training young actors &mdash; much as the choirs of the previous century had provided educated and capable talent (though the actors in Beeston's company tended to be older than the boys of the earlier troupes). After the elder Beeston's death in 1638, his son [[William Beeston]] continued the company, with uneven success, till the theatres closed in 1642; he even managed to re-form Beeston's Boys for a time once the theatres re-opened in the [[Restoration comedy|Restoration]].\n\n==Boys in adult companies==\nIn [[playing company|playing companies]] of adult actors, boys were initially given the female parts, but women were permitted to act on the stage from December [[1661 in literature|1661]]. A law against women on stage was implemented in England until that time.<ref>''Women Waging Law in Elizabethan England''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998. 304 pp</ref> Pre-pubescent boys were used for their unbroken voices, an accepted practice.\n\nBoy actors in adult companies apparently served as apprentices, in ways comparable to the practices of other guilds and trades of the age, though for shorter terms &mdash; perhaps two or three years instead of the usual seven. (The companies of adult actors were, in Elizabethan legal terms, retainers in noble households, and thus not subject to the legal statutes governing apprentices.){{fact|date=January 2014}}<ref>Individual actors sometimes maintained membership in guilds, precisely for the legal right to maintain apprentices. [[John Heminges]] was a member of the grocer's guild throughout his life, and [[Ben Jonson]] renewed his membership in the bricklayer's guild in 1599...but probably not because they were enthusiastic about greengrocering and bricklaying. [[Andrew Cane]], however, was an active goldsmith and a member of the Goldsmith's Company as well as the leading clown of [[Prince Charles's Men]] in the 1630s; and he turned his goldsmith's apprentices John Wright Arthur Savill into boy players with the company. Both appeared in [[Shackerley Marmion]]'s ''[[Holland's Leaguer (play)|Holland's Leaguer]]'' in December [[1631 in literature|1631]].{{fact|date=January 2014}}</ref> They performed female roles (and, of course, roles of male children if required) alongside adult male actors playing men or older female parts. In reference to [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] company, variously the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]] (1594&ndash;1603) or the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]] (1603 and after): [[Augustine Phillips]] left bequests to an apprentice, [[King's Men personnel|James Sands]], and a former apprentice, [[King's Men personnel|Samuel Gilburne]], in his will, read after his death in 1605; company members [[William Ostler]], [[John Underwood (actor)|John Underwood]], [[Nathan Field]], and [[King's Men personnel|John Rice]] had all started their acting careers as [[Children of the Chapel]] at the [[Blackfriars Theatre]].\n\n==Boys playing female roles==\nOne question has persisted: did boys play ''all'' female roles in [[English Renaissance theatre]], or were some roles, the most demanding ones, played by adult males? Some literary critics and some ordinary readers have found it incredible that the most formidable and complex female roles created by [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and [[John Webster|Webster]] could have been played by \"children.\"  The available evidence is incomplete and occasionally ambiguous; however, the overall implication is that even the largest roles were played by boys or young men, not mature adults. In a recent detailed survey of the evidence for the ages of boy actors and their roles, scholar David Kathman concludes that \"No significant evidence supports the idea that such roles were played by adult sharers but a wealth of specific evidence demonstrates that they were played by adolescent boys no older than about twenty-one\".<ref>David Kathman, \"How Old Were Shakespeare's Boy Actors?\" in ''Shakespeare Survey'' 58 (2006), p. 246.</ref> There are only two possible examples of adult actors playing female roles. The first appears in the cast list for [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]]'s ''[[The Wild Goose Chase]]'', in which the veteran comedian [[John Shank]] is listed; the entry reads \"Petella, their waiting-woman. Their Servant Mr. ''Shanck''.\"  However, Kathman argues that this refers to two roles, not one: Shank did not play Petella, but a comic servant who appears later in the play.<ref>Kathman, 234.</ref> The second example is the cast list for [[Thomas Heywood]]'s ''[[The Fair Maid of the West]]'', in which [[Anthony Turner (actor)|Anthony Turner]] apparently played the tiny role of a kitchen maid. Kathman suspects this is merely a misprint, but concludes that even if Turner did play this role, there remains no evidence for adults playing leading roles.<ref>Kathman, 238.</ref>\n\nMany boy actors filled female roles for a few years, then switched to male roles. An example: [[John Honyman]] started playing female roles for the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]] at the age of 13, in [[1626 in literature|1626]], in [[Philip Massinger]]'s ''[[The Roman Actor]]''. He played females for the next three years, through the King's Men's productions of [[Lodowick Carlell]]'s ''[[The Deserving Favourite]]'' and Massinger's ''[[The Picture (Massinger play)|The Picture]]'' (both in [[1629 in literature|1629]]). Yet in 1630, at the age of 17, Honyman switched to male roles and never returned to female roles. Other boy players with the King's Men, [[John Thompson (actor)|John Thompson]] and [[Richard Sharpe (actor)|Richard Sharpe]], appear to have played women for a decade or more, to the point at which they must have been \"young men\" rather than \"boys.\" [[Theophilus Bird]] played a woman when he was in his early 20s; but then he too switched to male roles.\n\nAudience members occasionally recorded positive impressions of the quality of the acting of boy players. When one Henry Jackson saw the King's Men perform ''[[Othello]]'' at Oxford in 1610, he wrote of the cast's Desdemona in his diary, \"She [sic] always acted the matter very well, in her death moved us still more greatly; when lying in bed she implored the pity of those watching with her countenance alone.\"<ref>Translated from the original Latin; Michael Shapiro, \"The Introduction of Actresses in England: Delay or Defensiveness?,\" in Comensoli and Russell, p. 185.</ref> The mere fact that Jackson referred to the boy as \"she,\" when he certainly knew better rationally, may in itself testify to the strength of the illusion.\n\n==Responses==\nMany [[Puritan]] preachers, who hated the theatre in general, were outraged by the use of boy players, which they believed encouraged homosexual lust. In [[1583 in literature|1583]], [[Philip Stubbes]] complained that plays were full of \"such wanton gestures, such bawdy speeches...such kissing and bussing\" that playgoers would go home together \"very friendly...and play the sodomites, or worse.\"<ref>Philip Stubbes, ''The Anatomy of Abuses'' (1583), quoted in Bruce R. Smith, ed. ''Twelfth Night: Texts and Contexts'' (New York: Bedford St Martin's, 2001), p. 275.</ref> John Rainolds warned of the \"filthy sparkles of lust to that vice the putting of women's attire on men may kindle in unclean affections.\"<ref>John Rainolds, ''The Overthrow of Stage Playes'' ([[1599 in literature|1599]]), quoted in Smith, ''Twelfth Night'', p. 276</ref>\n\nIn response to such comments, the actor-playwright [[Thomas Heywood]] protested that audiences were capable of distancing themselves: \"To see our youths attired in the habit of women, who knows not what their intents be? Who cannot distinguish them by their names, assuredly knowing they are but to represent such a lady, at such a time appointed?\"<ref>Thomas Heywood, ''An Apology for Actors'' ([[1612 in literature|1612]]), quoted in Smith, ''Twelfth Night'', p. 276</ref>\n\n==Famous boy players==\n*[[Christopher Beeston]] was perhaps the greatest success story among the child actors (at least in worldly terms). He continued his acting career into his maturity, became a theatre manager, and by the 1620s and '30s was arguably the most influential man in the world of London theatre.\n*[[Nathan Field]] was another success story of the children's companies. In ''[[Bartholomew Fair (play)|Bartholomew Fair]]'', Jonson hailed him as the \"best\" of the young actors (\"Which is your best actor, your Field?\"). As an adult, Field acted with the King's Men, and wrote creditable plays as well.\n*Solomon Pavy became one of the Children of the Chapel in 1600, at the age of ten. He acted in Jonson's ''Cynthia's Revels'' and ''The Poetaster.'' When he died prematurely in 1603, Jonson wrote an epitaph for him, praising Pavy's talent for playing old men.\n*[[Alexander Cooke]] was the boy who is thought to have created many of Shakespeare's heroines on stage. He remained with the King's Men as an adult actor.\n*[[Joseph Taylor (17th-century actor)|Joseph Taylor]] graduated from the Children of the Chapel, via [[Lady Elizabeth's Men]] and the Duke of York's/[[Prince Charles' Men]], to replace [[Richard Burbage]] as the leading man of the King's Men. He played Hamlet, Othello, and all the major Shakespearean roles.\n*[[Stephen Hammerton]] was a prominent boy actor with the King's Men in the last decade of English Renaissance theatre, 1632&ndash;42.\n*[[Hugh Clark (actor)|Hugh Clark]] was a noted boy player in the 1625&ndash;30 period.\n*[[Charles Hart (17th-century actor)|Charles Hart]] started out as a boy player with the King's Men, earning fame for his portrayal of the Duchess in [[James Shirley|Shirley's]] [[The Cardinal (play)|''The Cardinal'']] ([[1641 in literature|1641]]). He became a leading man and a star of the stage during the Restoration.\n*[[Theophilus Bird]] started as a boy player; like Hart he resumed his career as an adult actor when the theatres re-opened in 1660.\n*[[Edward Kynaston (actor)|Edward Kynaston]] was the last prominent boy actor; he worked during the [[Restoration comedy|Restoration]].\n\n==In film, literature and theatre==\nThe boy player has been a popular subject in literary, theatrical and cinematic representations of the Elizabethan theatre.\n*The film ''[[Shakespeare in Love]]'' features a boy player (played by [[Daniel Brocklebank]]) who performs Juliet in ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' before being ousted by [[Gwyneth Paltrow]]'s character (who is disguised as a man).\n*[[Nicholas Wright (playwright)|Nicholas Wright]]'s play ''[[Cressida (play)|Cressida]]'' is set in the 1630s and depicts the friendship between an elderly former boy player and the historical boy player [[Stephen Hammerton]].\n*The play and film ''[[Stage Beauty]]'' are about the Restoration boy player [[Edward Kynaston (actor)|Edward Kynaston]] and the transition to female acting.\n*[[Anthony Burgess]]'s novel about Christopher Marlowe, ''[[A Dead Man in Deptford]]'', is narrated by a boy player.\n*[[Tom Stoppard]]'s film of ''[[Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead]]'' features a scene in which the eponymous duo are briefly convinced of the femininity of a boy player.\n*[[Susan Cooper]]'s novel ''[[King of Shadows]]'' deals with boy actors including [[Nathan Field]].\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Comensoli, Viviana, and Anne Russell, eds.

Some boy players worked for the adult companies and performed the female roles as women did not perform on the English stage in this period. Others worked for children's companies in which all roles, not just the female ones, were played by boys.<ref>Chambers, Vol. 2, pp. 1-76.</ref><ref>Halliday, pp. 35, 71, 98-101.</ref>\n\n==Children's companies==\nIn the [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] and [[Jacobean era|Jacobean]] periods, troupes appeared that were composed entirely of boy players. They are famously mentioned in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'', in which a group of travelling actors has left the city due to rivalry with a troupe of \"little eyases\" (II, ii, 339); the term \"eyas\" means an unfledged [[hawk]].<ref>G. Blakemore Evans, ed., ''The Riverside Shakespeare'', Boston, Houghton Mifflin, 1974; p. 1156 n. 339.</ref>\n\nThe children's companies grew out of the choirs of boy singers that had been connected with cathedrals and similar institutions since the [[Middle Ages]]. (Similar boy choirs exist to this day.) Thus the choir attached to [[St. Paul's Cathedral]] in [[London]] since the 12th century was in the 16th century molded into a company of child actors, the [[Children of Paul's]].<ref>Chambers, Vol. 2, pp. 8-22.</ref> Similar groups of boy actors were connected with other institutions, including [[Eton College|Eton]], the [[Worshipful Company of Merchant Taylors|Merchant Taylors]] School, and the ecclesiastical college at [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]].<ref>Chambers, Vol. 2, pp. 68-76.</ref>\n\nThe boys were generally in the range of 8\u201312 years old (prepubescent boys are chosen as choirboys precisely because their voices have not yet \"broken\" with puberty). They were musically talented, strictly disciplined, educated in the [[Trivium (education)|trivium]] (grammar, logic, [[rhetoric]]), and sometimes fluent in Latin.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hillebrand|first1=Harold Newcomb|title=The Child Actors: A Chapter in Elizabethan Stage History|date=1964|publisher=Russell & Russel, Inc.|location=New York|page=37}}</ref> The boys amounted to formidable competition for the companies of adult actors in Elizabethan England.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gurr|first1=Andrew|title=The Shakespearean stage 1574-1642|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge university press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780521729666|page=46|edition=Fourth}}</ref> Between 1558 and 1576 (the year [[James Burbage]] built [[The Theatre]] in London and the age of popular Elizabethan drama began), companies of boy actors performed 46 times at Court, versus only 32 times for companies of adult actors in the same period. The playwright [[John Lyly]] earned fame when his \"Euphuistic\" plays were acted at Court by the Children of Paul's in the 1260. CHUPAME EL PITO\n\nThe practice of children acting was never free of controversy, however (see Responses, below). Companies of child actors went out of fashion, and did not return for a decade.\n\nIn [[1600 in literature|1600]], however, the practice saw a resurgence: the [[Children of the Chapel]] performed at the private [[Blackfriars Theatre]] for much of the first decade of the 17th century.<ref>Chambers, Vol. 2, pp. 23-60.</ref> Their performances of the plays of [[Ben Jonson]] were especially popular. (The [[Globe Theatre]] was decorated with a statue of [[Hercules]], the playhouse's symbol.) The Children of Paul's were also acting publicly once again at this time.\n\nThe children probably attained their greatest notoriety during the ''Poetomachia'' or [[War of the Theatres]] ([[1599 in literature|1599]]&ndash;[[1601 in literature|1601]]). Two troupes were intimately involved on the competing sides: the Children of Paul's acted [[John Marston (poet)|John Marston]]'s ''[[Jack Drum's Entertainment]]'' (1600) and ''[[What You Will]]'' (1601) and [[Thomas Dekker (poet)|Thomas Dekker]]'s ''[[Satiromastix]]'' (1601), while the Children of the Chapel had Jonson's ''[[Cynthia's Revels]]'' (1600) and ''[[The Poetaster]]'' (1601).\n\nThe boys' troupes were strongly associated with the satirical comedy of Jonson, Marston, and [[Thomas Middleton]], which has sometimes been described as a coterie drama for gentleman \"wits\", in contrast to the popular drama of writers like Shakespeare and [[Thomas Heywood]] that was performed at the Globe and the other large public theatres. Yet the boys also played serious tragedies and contemporary histories, notably the works of [[George Chapman]] &mdash; ''[[Bussy D'Ambois]]'', ''[[The Revenge of Bussy D'Ambois]]'', and the double play ''[[The Conspiracy and Tragedy of Charles, Duke of Byron]]''. Modern readers and theatergoers can only wonder what these productions were like.   \n\nThe brand of coterie drama practiced by Jonson and others was often controversial, however; the official displeasure that greeted the play ''[[Eastward Ho]]'', which landed two of its authors in jail, also fell upon the boys who performed it. By [[1606 in literature|1606]] the Children of Paul's had ceased performing, and the Children of the Chapel were no longer associated with the Royal Chapel and had lost royal patronage; they became merely the Children of the Blackfriars. The boys' troupes had ceased public dramatic performance and the fashion died out by about 1615. The [[Lady Elizabeth's Men]] was a new company granted a patent on April 27, [[1615 in literature|1615]], under the patronage of King James' daughter [[Elizabeth of Bohemia|Princess Elizabeth]]; it was composed, to some significant degree, of veterans of the children's companies, now grown to manhood.<ref>Chambers, Vol. 2, pp. 246-60.</ref>\n\nWhile controversial in their time, the children's companies had been effective in funnelling talented, educated, and experienced young actors into the adult companies. To recapture this influence, [[Richard Gunnell]] attempted to start a children's company with 14 boys and several adults when he built the [[Salisbury Court Theatre]] in [[1629 in literature|1629]]. The enterprise was not a success, because of a long closure of the theatres due to plague soon after its inception; but it did produce [[Stephen Hammerton]], who went on to act with the King's Men, and became an early [[matinee idol]] among young women in the audience for his romantic leads.<ref>[[Andrew John Gurr|Andrew Gurr]], ''The Shakespearean Stage'', pp. 63-4</ref> \n\nA limited renewal of the practice of children's companies came in [[1637 in literature|1637]], when [[Christopher Beeston]] established, under royal warrant, the King and Queen's Young Company, colloquially called [[Beeston's Boys]]. The intent was in part to have a structure for training young actors &mdash; much as the choirs of the previous century had provided educated and capable talent (though the actors in Beeston's company tended to be older than the boys of the earlier troupes). After the elder Beeston's death in 1638, his son [[William Beeston]] continued the company, with uneven success, till the theatres closed in 1642; he even managed to re-form Beeston's Boys for a time once the theatres re-opened in the [[Restoration comedy|Restoration]].\n\n==Boys in adult companies==\nIn [[playing company|playing companies]] of adult actors, boys were initially given the female parts, but women were permitted to act on the stage from December [[1661 in literature|1661]]. A law against women on stage was implemented in England until that time.<ref>''Women Waging Law in Elizabethan England''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998. 304 pp</ref> Pre-pubescent boys were used for their unbroken voices, an accepted practice.\n\nBoy actors in adult companies apparently served as apprentices, in ways comparable to the practices of other guilds and trades of the age, though for shorter terms &mdash; perhaps two or three years instead of the usual seven. (The companies of adult actors were, in Elizabethan legal terms, retainers in noble households, and thus not subject to the legal statutes governing apprentices.){{fact|date=January 2014}}<ref>Individual actors sometimes maintained membership in guilds, precisely for the legal right to maintain apprentices. [[John Heminges]] was a member of the grocer's guild throughout his life, and [[Ben Jonson]] renewed his membership in the bricklayer's guild in 1599...but probably not because they were enthusiastic about greengrocering and bricklaying. [[Andrew Cane]], however, was an active goldsmith and a member of the Goldsmith's Company as well as the leading clown of [[Prince Charles's Men]] in the 1630s; and he turned his goldsmith's apprentices John Wright Arthur Savill into boy players with the company. Both appeared in [[Shackerley Marmion]]'s ''[[Holland's Leaguer (play)|Holland's Leaguer]]'' in December [[1631 in literature|1631]].{{fact|date=January 2014}}</ref> They performed female roles (and, of course, roles of male children if required) alongside adult male actors playing men or older female parts. In reference to [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] company, variously the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]] (1594&ndash;1603) or the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]] (1603 and after): [[Augustine Phillips]] left bequests to an apprentice, [[King's Men personnel|James Sands]], and a former apprentice, [[King's Men personnel|Samuel Gilburne]], in his will, read after his death in 1605; company members [[William Ostler]], [[John Underwood (actor)|John Underwood]], [[Nathan Field]], and [[King's Men personnel|John Rice]] had all started their acting careers as [[Children of the Chapel]] at the [[Blackfriars Theatre]].\n\n==Boys playing female roles==\nOne question has persisted: did boys play ''all'' female roles in [[English Renaissance theatre]], or were some roles, the most demanding ones, played by adult males? Some literary critics and some ordinary readers have found it incredible that the most formidable and complex female roles created by [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and [[John Webster|Webster]] could have been played by \"children.\"  The available evidence is incomplete and occasionally ambiguous; however, the overall implication is that even the largest roles were played by boys or young men, not mature adults.

An example: [[John Honyman]] started playing female roles for the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]] at the age of 13, in [[1626 in literature|1626]], in [[Philip Massinger]]'s ''[[The Roman Actor]]''. He played females for the next three years, through the King's Men's productions of [[Lodowick Carlell]]'s ''[[The Deserving Favourite]]'' and Massinger's ''[[The Picture (Massinger play)|The Picture]]'' (both in [[1629 in literature|1629]]). Yet in 1630, at the age of 17, Honyman switched to male roles and never returned to female roles. Other boy players with the King's Men, [[John Thompson (actor)|John Thompson]] and [[Richard Sharpe (actor)|Richard Sharpe]], appear to have played women for a decade or more, to the point at which they must have been \"young men\" rather than \"boys.\" [[Theophilus Bird]] played a woman when he was in his early 20s; but then he too switched to male roles.\n\nAudience members occasionally recorded positive impressions of the quality of the acting of boy players.

It is buoyant, widely available and easily worked. It is a popular material for small boats (of e.g. {{convert|6|m|adj=on}} length; such as dinghies and sailboats). Its abrasion resistance varies according to the hardness and density of the wood and it can deteriorate if fresh water or marine organisms are allowed to penetrate the wood. Woods such as [[Teak]], [[Podocarpus totara|Totara]] and some [[Cedrus|cedar]]s have natural chemicals which prevent rot whereas other woods, such as [[Pinus radiata]], will rot very quickly. The hull of a wooden boat usually consists of planking fastened to frames and a keel. Keel and frames are traditionally made of hardwoods such as [[oak]] while planking can be [[oak]] but is more often softwood such as [[pine]], [[larch]] or [[Cedrus|cedar]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Chapelle|first=Howard Irving|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OkCNFCYSl_EC&newbks=0&printsec=frontcover&dq=FAST+boat+construction&hl=en|title=Boatbuilding: A Complete Handbook of Wooden Boat Construction|date=1994|publisher=W. W. Norton & Company|isbn=978-0-393-03554-4|language=en}}</ref>\n\n[[Plywood]] is especially popular for amateur construction but only marine ply using waterproof glues and even laminates should be used. Cheap construction plywood often has voids in the interior layers and is not suitable to boat building as the voids trap moisture and accelerate rot as well as physically weaken the plywood. No plywood is rot resistant and should be coated with epoxy resin and/or a good paint system. Varnish and Linseed oil should not be used on the exterior of a hull for waterproofing. Varnish has about 60% of the water resistance of a good paint system. Only boiled linseed oil should be used on a boat and only in the interior as it has very little water resistance but it is very easy to apply and has a pleasant smell. Note that used linseed rags should not be left in a pile as they can catch fire. A valuable 200-year-old waka (Maori canoe) caught fire in New Zealand in June 2014 when restorers left rags piled overnight. Raw linseed oil is not suited to boats as it stays damp and oily for a long time. Mildew will grow well on raw linseed oil treated timber but not on boiled linseed oil. More recently introduced tropical woods as [[mahogany]], [[Aucoumea klaineana|okoum\u00e9]], [[iroko (hardwood)|iroko]], [[Dipterocarpus|Keruing]], [[Lophira alata|azob\u00e9]] and [[Intsia bijuga|merbau]].<ref>Zeilen:Van beginner tot gevorderde by Karel Heijnen</ref> are also used. With tropical species, extra attention needs to be taken to ensure that the wood is indeed [[Forest Stewardship Council|FSC]]-certified.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nrdc.org/land/forests/woodguide.asp |title=FSC certification |publisher=Nrdc.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref> Teak or [[iroko (hardwood)|iroko]] is usually used to create the deck and any superstructure. [[Adhesive|Glue]], [[screw]]s, [[rivets]] and/or [[nail (fastener)|nails]] are used to join the wooden components. Before teak is glued the natural oil must be wiped off with a chemical cleaner, otherwise the joint will fail.\n\nSome types of wood construction include:\n*'''[[carvel (boat building)|Carvel]]''', in which a smooth hull is formed by edge joined planks attached to a frame. The planks may be curved in cross section like barrel staves. Carvel planks are generally caulked with oakum or cotton that is driven into the seams between the planks and covered with some waterproof substance. It takes its name from an archaic ship type and is believed to have originated in the Mediterranean. A number of boat building texts are available which describe the carvel planking method in detail.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://notablemath.weebly.com/carvel-planking.html |title=Carvel Planking for Boats, Sailboats: Richard Joyce Montana Tech |publisher=Notablemath.weebly.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref>\n*'''[[Clinker (boat building)|Clinker]]''' is a technique originally identified with the [[History of Scandinavia|Scandinavia]]ns and [[Ingveonic]] people in which [[wood]]en planks are fixed to each other with a slight overlap that is beveled for a tight fit. The planks may be mechanically connected to each other with copper rivets, bent over iron nails, screws or in modern boats with adhesives. Often, [[steam bending|steam bent]] wooden ribs are fitted inside the hull.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Oughtred|first=Iain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oVTIRC2A5kAC&newbks=0&printsec=frontcover&pg=PA2&dq=Clinker+boat+construction&hl=en|title=Clinker Plywood Boatbuilding Manual|date=2000|publisher=WoodenBoat Books|year=|isbn=978-0-937822-61-6|location=|pages=2|language=en}}</ref>\n*[[Strip planking]] is yet another type of wooden boat construction similar to carvel. It is a glued construction method which is very popular with amateur boatbuilders as it is quick, avoids complex temporary jig work and does not require shaping of the planks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gartsideboats.com/faq2.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123155407/http://gartsideboats.com/faq2.php |archivedate=2010-11-23 |title=Planking Methods Comparison |publisher=Gartsideboats.com |date=2010-11-23 |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref>\n* [[Sheet plywood boat building]] uses sheets of '''[[plywood|plywood panel]]'''s usually fixed to longitudinal long wood such the chines, inwhales (sheer clamps) or intermediate stringers which are all bent around a series of frames. By attaching the ply sheets to the longwood rather than directly to the frames this avoids hard spots or an unfair hull. Plywood may be laminated into a round hull or used in single sheets. These hulls generally have one or more chines and the method is called [[Chine (boating)|Ply on Frame construction]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boatbuilding.net/article.pl?sid=07/10/17/1655255 |title=Ply on Frame construction |publisher=Boatbuilding.net |accessdate=2012-06-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305183809/http://www.boatbuilding.net/article.pl?sid=07%2F10%2F17%2F1655255 |archivedate=2012-03-05 }}</ref> A subdivision of the sheet plywood boat building method is known as the [[stitch and glue|stitch-and-glue]] method,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.glen-l.com/resources/glossary.html |title=Stitch and glue subdivision of sheet plywood method |publisher=Glen-l.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref> where pre-shaped panels of plywood are drawn together then edge glued and reinforced with fibreglass without the use of a frame.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boatbuilder.org/stitchandglue.htm |title=Benefits of stitch and glue |publisher=Boatbuilder.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref> Metal or plastic ties, nylon fishing line or copper wires pull curved flat panels into three-dimensional curved shapes. These hulls generally have one or more chines. Marine grade plywood of good quality is designated \"WBP\" (which stands for water- and boiled-proof) or more usually BS 1088. Australian plywood manufacturers and suppliers have issued warnings that some Asian nations are selling ply stamped BS 1088 which does not meet international standards. Specifically, they say outer plies are too thin (should be {{convert|1.2|mm|abbr=on|disp=or}} minimum) or are very thin (less than {{convert|0.5|mm|abbr=on|disp=or}}) or high-grade surface ply such as Okoume is combined with a much heavier and wider inner cores. Most high-grade marine Okoume (Gaboon) ply uses lightweight poplar inner cores. Often the 1088 stamp is blurred in the poor Asian ply so it is not clear. In Australia and New Zealand a higher-grade marine ply than BS1088 is AS2272. It requires both faces to be \"A\" quality, with even-thickness plies. The most common plywood used for this grade is plantation-grown Hoop Pine which is fine grained, very smooth, moderately light (at {{convert|570|kg/m3|lb/cuft|abbr=on|disp=or}} it is the same weight as Meranti ply and about 13% heavier than genuine poplar cored BS1088 Okoume). Hoop pine has a very high stress rating of F17, indicating high strength. Meranti (Lauan) ply has a stress rating of F14 and Okoume ply F8. Okoume ply is commonly coated with epoxy to increase strength and impact resistance as well as to exclude water. Both types of plywood construction are very popular with amateur builders, and many dinghies such as the [[Vaurien]], Cherub, [[Tolman Skiff|Tolman]], Moth and P class  (ply on frame construction) and FJs, FDs and [[Kolibri (keelboat)|Kolibri]]s (stitch-and-glue method) have been built from it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bearfacemedia.co.uk/European_Dinghies.aspx|title=European Dinghies build by amateur builders |publisher=Bearfacemedia.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clubsnautiques.com/vaurien/txt_angl.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502141046/http://www.clubsnautiques.com/vaurien/txt_angl.htm |archivedate=2009-05-02 |title=Vaurien amateur building |publisher=Clubsnautiques.com |date=2009-05-02 |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref> Another variation is tortured ply where very thin({{convert|3|mm|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and flexible (often Okoume)preshaped panels ply are bent into compound curves and sewn together. Little or no framework or longitudinal wood is used. This method is mainly confined to kayaks.\n* '''[[Cold moulding]]''' is a composite method of wooden boat building that uses two or more layers of thin wood, called veneers, oriented in different directions, resulting in a strong monocoque structure, similar to a fibreglass hull but substantially lighter. Sometimes composed of a base layer of strip planking followed by multiple veneers. Sometimes just veneers are used.<ref>\u2033The Gougeon Brothers on Boat Construction, Wood and West System Materials\u2033</ref> Cold-moulding is popular in small, medium and very large, wooden super-yachts. Using different types of wood, the builder can lighten some areas such as bow and stern and strengthen other high-stress areas. Sometimes cold-moulded hulls are protected either inside or out or both with fibreglass or similar products for impact resistance, especially when lightweight, soft timber such as cedar is used. This method lends itself to great flexibility in hull shape.<ref>[http://wiki.dtonline.org/index.php/Cold_Moulding Cold moulding website]</ref>\n\nCold-moulded refers to a type of building one-off hulls using thin strips of wood applied to a series of forms at 45-degree angles to the centerline. This method is often called double-diagonal because a minimum of two layers is recommended, each occurring at opposing 45-degree angles. The \"hot-moulded\" method of building boats, which used ovens to heat and cure the resin, has not been widely used since World War II; and now almost all curing is done at room temperature.\n\n===Metal===\n====Iron and steel====\nEither used in sheet or alternatively, [[Sheet metal|plate]] <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/shipbuildingrepair/fabricating.html |title=Welding, hot-riveting or drilling of plates |publisher=Osha.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref> for all-metal hulls or for isolated structural members. It is strong, but heavy (despite the fact that the thickness of the hull can be less). It is generally about 30% heavier than aluminium and somewhat more heavy than [[polyester]]. The material rusts unless protected from water (this is usually done by means of a covering of paint). Modern steel components are [[welding|welded]] or [[Bolted joint|bolt]]ed together. As the welding can be done very easily (with common welding equipment), and as the material is very cheap, it is a popular material with amateur builders. Also, amateur builders which are not yet well established in building steel ships may opt for [[Do it yourself|DIY]] construction kits. If steel is used, a zinc layer is often applied to coat the entire hull. It is applied after [[sandblasting]] (which is required to have a cleaned surface) and before painting. The painting is usually done with [[lead paint]] (Pb<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>). Optionally, the covering with the zinc layer may be left out, but it is generally not recommended. [[Zinc]] [[anode]]s also need to be placed on the ship's hull. Until the mid-1900s, steel sheets were [[rivet]]ed together.\n\n[[File:Punt-building-workshop-in-Oxford.jpg|thumb|A [[punt (boat)|punt]] under construction]]\n[[File:Lake Bennett boats.jpg|thumb|Wooden boats under construction during the [[Klondike Gold Rush]]]]\n\n====Aluminum====\nAluminum and aluminum alloys are used both in sheet form for all-metal hulls or for isolated structural members. Many sailing spars are frequently made of aluminium after 1960. The material requires special manufacturing techniques, construction tools and construction skills. It is the lightest material for building large boats (being 15-20% lighter than polyester and 30% lighter than steel). Aluminium is very expensive in most countries and it is usually not used by amateur builders. While it is easy to cut, aluminium is difficult to weld, and also requires heat treatments such as [[precipitation hardening|precipitation strengthening]] for most applications.  Galvanic [[corrosion]] below the waterline is a serious concern, particularly in marinas where there are other conflicting metals. Aluminium is most commonly found in yachts and power boats that are not kept permanently in the water. Aluminium yachts are particularly popular in France.\n\n====Cupronickel====\nA relatively expensive metal used only very occasionally in boatbuilding is [[cupronickel]]. Arguably the ideal metal for boat hulls, cupronickel is reasonably tough, highly resistant to corrosion in seawater, and is (because of its copper content) a very effective [[antifouling]] metal. Cupronickel may be found on the [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]]s of premium [[tugboat]]s, [[fishing boat]]s and other working [[boat]]s; and may even be used for [[propeller]]s and  [[crankshaft|propeller shafts]].\n\n===Fiberglass===\n[[Fiberglass]] ([[glass-reinforced plastic]] or GRP) is typically used for production boats because of its ability to reuse a female mould as the foundation for the shape of the boat. The resulting structure is strong in tension but often needs to be either laid up with many heavy layers of resin-saturated fiberglass or reinforced with wood or foam in order to provide stiffness. GRP hulls are largely free of corrosion though not normally fireproof. These can be solid fiberglass or of the sandwich (cored) type, in which a core of [[Ochroma pyramidale|balsa]], [[foam]] or similar material is applied after the outer layer of fiberglass is laid to the mould, but before the inner skin is laid. This is similar to the next type, composite, but is not usually classified as composite, since the core material in this case does not provide much additional strength. It does, however, increase stiffness, which means that less resin and fiberglass cloth can be used in order to save weight. Most fibreglass boats are currently made in an open mould, with fibreglass and resin applied by hand ([[hand-lay-up]] method). Some are now constructed by vacuum infusion where the fibres are laid out and resin is pulled into the mould by atmospheric pressure. This can produce stronger parts with more glass and less resin, but takes special materials and more technical knowledge. Older fibreglass boats before 1990 were often not constructed in controlled temperature buildings leading to the widespread problem of fibreglass pox, where seawater seeped through small holes and caused delamination. The name comes from the multiude of surface pits in the outer gelcoat layer which resembles smallpox. Sometimes the problem was caused by atmospheric moisture being trapped in the layup during construction in humid weather.\n\n===Composite material===\n\"Composite construction\" involves a variety of [[composite material]]s and methods: an early example was a timber carvel skin attached to a frame and deck beams made of iron. Sheet copper anti-fouling (\"copper=bottomed\") could be attached to a wooden hull provided the risk of galvanic corrosion was minimised. Fast cargo vessels once were copper-bottomed to prevent being slowed by marine fouling.  GRP and ferrocement hulls are classic composite hulls, the term \"composite\" applies also to plastics reinforced with fibers other than glass.  When a hull is being created in a female mould, the composite materials are applied to the mould in the form of a [[thermosetting plastic]] (usually [[epoxy]], polyester, or vinylester) and some kind of fiber cloth ([[fiberglass]], [[kevlar]], [[dynel]], [[carbon fiber]], etc.). These methods can give strength-to-weight ratios approaching that of aluminum, while requiring less specialized tools and construction skills.\n\n===Ferrocement===\n[[File:RHGib jpg.jpg|thumb|A 22-meter professionally built ferrocement staysail schooner]]\nFirst developed in the mid-19th century in both France and Holland, ferrocement was also used for the [[D-Day]] [[Mulberry harbour]]s. After a buzz of excitement among homebuilders in the 1960s, ferro building has since declined.\n\nFerrocement is a relatively cheap method to produce a hull, although unsuitable for commercial mass production. A steel and iron \"armature\" is built to the exact shape of the hull, ultimately being covered in galvanised chicken netting. Then, on a single day, the cement is applied by a team of plasterers. The cement:sand ratio is a very rich 4:1; do not call it concrete! As the hull thickness is typically 2.5 to 3 cms,  ferrocement is unsuitable for boats less than about 15 metres [[Length overall|LOA]] as there is a weight penalty; above that length there is no penalty. Properly plastered ferrocement boats have smooth hulls with fine lines, and amateur builders are advised to use professional plasterers to produce a smooth finish. In the 1960s and 1970s, particularly in Australia and New Zealand, the cheapness of ferro construction encouraged amateur builders to build hulls larger than they could afford, not anticipating that the fitting-out costs of a larger boat can be crippling.\n\nThe advantages of a ferro hull are:\n* cannot burn, rot, or rust; & no osmosis\n* good insulation: cool in summer, warm in winter\n* tougher than [[fiberglass|GRP]], and almost as tough as a steel vessel; (and if damaged, easily repaired almost anywhere in the world)\n* properly built, a ferro hull is as fair as a GRP hull.\n* they may be cheap to buy (see disadvantages, below)\n\nThe disadvantages are:\n* many home-built ferro boats are lumpy, overweight and ugly.\n* some early builders, realising that their creation proved to be disappointing, scuttled their vessels and fraudulently claimed insurance.\n* accordingly, ferro yachts may be difficult to sell and nigh impossible to insure.\n\n''See also'': [[concrete ship]], [[concrete canoe]].\n\n==Hull types==\n{{Further|Hull (watercraft)}}\n\nThere are many hull types, and a builder should choose the most appropriate one for the boat's intended purpose. For example, a sea-going vessel needs a hull which is more stable and robust than a hull used in rivers and canals. Hull types include:\n\n* [[Smooth curve hull]]: these are rounded and free of chines or corners.\n* [[Chine (boating)|Chined hulls]]: these are hulls have flat panels (typically plywood) which meet at a sharp angle known as the \"chine\". Chined hulls range from simple flat-bottomed boats where the topsides and bottom meet at about 110 degrees (such as [[Banks dory|banks dories]] and [[Sharpie (boat)|sharpie]]s) to skiffs where the bottom is arced rather than flat. Multi-chine hulls allow an approximation of a round hull shape.\n* [[Flat-bottomed boat|Flat-bottomed hull]]: flat-bottomed hulls are suitable for canals and non-tidal rivers. They are often shallow-draft, and may operate in shallower water. They are cheap  to build but, being less stable and having no keel to give directional stability, they are unsuitable for sea-going vessels. (However, large ships are almost always flat bottomed, having a suitably large draft to overcome the problems of small flat-bottomed boats).\n* [[Hull (watercraft)|Displacement hulls]]: a displacement hull always remains partly submerged. Such a hull has a maximum \"hull speed\" which is a function of its waterline length. An exception is the [[catamaran]], whose twin hulls are usually so fine that they do not engender a bow wave.\n* [[Planing (sailing)|Planing]] hulls: planing hulls have a shape that allows the boat to rise out of the water as the speed increases. Sail boats that plane are typical V-shaped at the bows and flat-bottomed aft. Hydroplanes are very light, flat bottomed, high powered speed boats that plane easily on flat water, but they become unstable in rough water. Powerboats designed for rough water are usually deep V-bottomed with a deadrise angle of about 20-23 degrees. The most common form is to have at least one chine to allow for stability when cornering and for a supportive surface on which to ride while planing. Planing hulls allow much higher speeds to be achieved, as they are not limited by the waterline length the way displacement hulls are. Planing hulls need sufficient power to \"reach the plane\", after which the lack of drag allows high speeds yet with reduced power consumption.\n\n==Glossary==\n{{main|Glossary of nautical terms}}\n[[File:Samos Agios Isidoros 001.jpg|thumb|Boat building in Greece]]\n[[File:Samos Agios Isidoros 002.jpg|thumb|Side view of the wooden frame]]\n<!-- ***PLEASE NOTE*** This is not a catch-all <ref></ref>of miscellaneous marine terms.

Its sides are notched to receive the tapered forward ends of deck planking so that no end grain is exposed.\n*[[Knee (construction)|Knee]]: a short L shaped piece of wood that joins or strengthens the joint in boat parts that meet between roughly 60 and 120 degrees. It may be a natural crook from a suitable wood species, sawn from a larger piece of timber, or laminated to size. Commonly used on thwarts to join topsides or keelsons to join transoms. A hanging knee sits upright beneath a thwart to support it. Hanging knees often support carlins where a full frame would be inconvenient.\n*[[Locker (cabinet)|Locker]]: an enclosed storage space\n*[[Mast (sailing)|Mast]]: a large vertical spar which supports the sails. It may be supported by standing rigging, but some rigs (such a junks) have unstayed masted.\n*[[Mast step]]: a socket to take the downward thrust of the mast and hold it in position.

Ribs differ from frames or futtocks in being far smaller dimensions and bent in place compared to frames or futtocks, which are normally sawn to shape, or natural crooks that are shaped to fit with an adze, axe or chisel.\n*[[Rigging]]: standing rigging (either \"stays\" or shrouds\") are the wire cables or rods that support the mast(s).  Running rigging are the ropes (\"sheets\") to control the sails. \n*[[Rowlock]] (pronounced \"rollock\";(also \"oarlock\"): a 'U' shaped metal device that secures an oar and acts as a fulcrum during the motion of rowing. \n*[[Rudder]]: a hinged vertical plate at the stern for steering a craft. There may be more than one rudder.\n*[[Sampson post]]: a strong vertical post which supports a ship's [[windlass]] and the heel of its [[bowsprit]], also used to making off mooring lines.\n*[[Scupper]]s: gaps in the bulwarks permitting water to drain off the deck.\n*[[Shackle]]: a U-shaped fitting secured by a removable pin for securely connecting chains, lines, and other fittings.  Known as a \"snap shackle\" when fitted with a spring-loaded pin.\n*[[Sheave box]]: a plastic or stainless steel box that holds a pulley that is fixed in position as on a mast head.\n*[[Sheer (ship)|Sheer]]: the generally curved shape of the upper hull.

Common alloys are \"18/8\" (known as \"surgical stainless steel\") and \"316\" (\"marine grade\"), which contains more salt-water resistant nickel.\n*[[Stays (nautical)|Stays]]/[[shroud (sailing)|shrouds]]: standing or running rigging which holds a spar in position (e.g. forestay, backstay, bobstay). Formerly made of rope, typically of braided stainless steel wire, occasionally solid metal rod.\n*[[Stem (ship)|Stem]]: a continuation of the keel upwards at the bow where the two sides of the hull meet.\n*[[Stern]]: the aftmost part of a boat, often ending in a transom.\n*[[Stern sheets]] a flat area or deck, inboard of the transom in a small boat. It may contain hatches to access below decks or provide storage on deck for life saving equipment.\n*[[Strake]]: planking, running from the \"garboard\" strake affixed to the keel to the \"sheer\" strake below the caprail.\n*[[Clinker (boat building)|Stringer]] (also \"batten\"): a long relatively thin, knot free length of wood, running fore and aft, often used to reinforce planking on the inside of the hull.\n*[[Synthetic rope]]: lines manufactured from chained chemicals.  The four most common are: polyester (including brand names Dacron and Terylene), a strong, low stretch line, usually plaited (braided) used for running rigging; nylon, a strong but elastic line resistant to shock loads, best suited for mooring lines and anchor warps. It is usually laid (twisted) so to make it easier to grip when hauling; polypropylene, a light, cheap, slippery, buoyant line, typically laid, which is by far the weakest of the four, and deteriorates when exposed to sunlight. Commonly used on commercial fishing boats using nets; and Kevlar, an extremely strong and expensive fibre with almost no stretch, usually braided and best suited for halyards.\n*[[Taff rail]]: a railing at the extreme stern of a vessel.\n*[[Thwart]]: a transverse member used to maintain the shape of the topsides of a small boat, often doubling as a seat.\n*[[Tiller]]: a forward-facing attached to the rudder allowing a helmsman to steer a boat. On a dinghy, the tiller may have a hinged extension called a \"jigger\".\n*[[Toe rail]]: an upright longitudinal strip of wood surrounding a deck near the sheer, especially forward, for safety and to provide purchase when a boat is heeled.\n*[[Topping Lift]]: a line running from a cleat on the mast through a block at the masthead and down to the aft end of a boom for supporting the boom when not in use or when reefing. \n*[[Topsides (nautical)|Topsides]]: the side planking of a boat from the waterline to the sheerstrake.\n*[[Transom (nautical)|Transom]]: a vertical part of the hull at the stern. Transoms provide width and sadditional buoyancy at the stern. Dinghies may attach an outboard motor to the transom.\n*Warp: anchor line, traditionally made of stiff natural fibre such as hemp, today of stronger, lighter, synthetic fibres such as laid nylon, prized for its elasticity in absorbing shock loads on an anchor. \n*[[Winch]]: a geared device providing both friction and mechanical advantage in sail trimming, hoisting large sails, and retrieving an anchor. Some winches are self-tailing, allowing efficient one-man usage, others electrically powered.\n*[[Wind pennant]]: a small pivoting masthead wind indicator.\n*[[Yard (sailing)|Yard]]: a horizontal spar on a square rigged ship fitted to the forward side of a mast, holding a square sail forward of the shrouds. An extension to the yard is the \"yard-arm\".\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"175\" class=\"center\" caption=\"Traditional boat building in India\" >\nFile:View of a Boat at Bheemili (being manufactured).jpg|Boat construction underway at [[Bheemunipatnam]]<ref name=Sulkha>{{cite web|url=http://www.sulkhashipyard.in/About.html |title=Sulkha shipyard |publisher=Sulkhashipyard.in |date= |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref>\n</gallery>\n\n<center>\n<gallery widths=\"175\" caption=\"Traditional wooden boat building in Vietnam.

It is buoyant, widely available and easily worked. It is a popular material for small boats (of e.g. {{convert|6|m|adj=on}} length; such as dinghies and sailboats). Its abrasion resistance varies according to the hardness and density of the wood and it can deteriorate if fresh water or marine organisms are allowed to penetrate the wood. Woods such as [[Teak]], [[Podocarpus totara|Totara]] and some [[Cedrus|cedar]]s have natural chemicals which prevent rot whereas other woods, such as [[Pinus radiata]], will rot very quickly. The hull of a wooden boat usually consists of planking fastened to frames and a keel. Keel and frames are traditionally made of hardwoods such as [[oak]] while planking can be [[oak]] but is more often softwood such as [[pine]], [[larch]] or [[Cedrus|cedar]].\n\n[[Plywood]] is especially popular for amateur construction but only marine ply using waterproof glues and even laminates should be used. Cheap construction plywood often has voids in the interior layers and is not suitable to boat building as the voids trap moisture and accelerate rot as well as physically weaken the plywood. No plywood is rot resistant and should be coated with epoxy resin and/or a good paint system. Varnish and Linseed oil should not be used on the exterior of a hull for waterproofing. Varnish has about 60% of the water resistance of a good paint system. Only boiled linseed oil should be used on a boat and only in the interior as it has very little water resistance but it is very easy to apply and has a pleasant smell. Note that used linseed rags should not be left in a pile as they can catch fire. A valuable 200-year-old waka (Maori canoe) caught fire in New Zealand in June 2014 when restorers left rags piled overnight. Raw linseed oil is not suited to boats as it stays damp and oily for a long time. Mildew will grow well on raw linseed oil treated timber but not on boiled linseed oil. More recently introduced tropical woods as [[mahogany]], [[Aucoumea klaineana|okoum\u00e9]], [[iroko (hardwood)|iroko]], [[Dipterocarpus|Keruing]], [[Lophira alata|azob\u00e9]] and [[Intsia bijuga|merbau]].<ref>Zeilen:Van beginner tot gevorderde by Karel Heijnen</ref> are also used. With tropical species, extra attention needs to be taken to ensure that the wood is indeed [[Forest Stewardship Council|FSC]]-certified.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nrdc.org/land/forests/woodguide.asp |title=FSC certification |publisher=Nrdc.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.glen-l.com/wood-plywood/wp-index.html |title=Boat building lumber |publisher=Glen-l.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref> Teak or [[iroko (hardwood)|iroko]] is usually used to create the deck and any superstructure. [[Adhesive|Glue]], [[screw]]s, [[rivets]] and/or [[nail (fastener)|nails]] are used to join the wooden components. Before teak is glued the natural oil must be wiped off with a chemical cleaner, otherwise the joint will fail.\n\nSome types of wood construction include:\n*'''[[carvel (boat building)|Carvel]]''', in which a smooth hull is formed by edge joined planks attached to a frame. The planks may be curved in cross section like barrel staves. Carvel planks are generally caulked with oakum or cotton that is driven into the seams between the planks and covered with some waterproof substance. It takes its name from an archaic ship type and is believed to have originated in the Mediterranean. A number of boat building texts are available which describe the carvel planking method in detail.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://notablemath.weebly.com/carvel-planking.html |title=Carvel Planking for Boats, Sailboats: Richard Joyce Montana Tech |publisher=Notablemath.weebly.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref>\n*'''[[Clinker (boat building)|Clinker]]''' is a technique originally identified with the [[History of Scandinavia|Scandinavia]]ns and [[Ingveonic]] people in which [[wood]]en planks are fixed to each other with a slight overlap that is beveled for a tight fit. The planks may be mechanically connected to each other with copper rivets, bent over iron nails, screws or in modern boats with adhesives. Often, [[steam bending|steam bent]] wooden ribs are fitted inside the hull.\n*[[Strip planking]] is yet another type of wooden boat construction similar to carvel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jordanboats.co.uk/JB/strip_plank.htm |title=Strip Planking |publisher=Jordanboats.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref> It is a glued construction method which is very popular with amateur boatbuilders as it is quick, avoids complex temporary jig work and does not require shaping of the planks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gartsideboats.com/faq2.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123155407/http://gartsideboats.com/faq2.php |archivedate=2010-11-23 |title=Planking Methods Comparison |publisher=Gartsideboats.com |date=2010-11-23 |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref>\n* [[Sheet plywood boat building]] uses sheets of '''[[plywood|plywood panel]]'''s usually fixed to longitudinal long wood such the chines, inwhales (sheer clamps) or intermediate stringers which are all bent around a series of frames. By attaching the ply sheets to the longwood rather than directly to the frames this avoids hard spots or an unfair hull. Plywood may be laminated into a round hull or used in single sheets. These hulls generally have one or more chines and the method is called [[Chine (boating)|Ply on Frame construction]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boatbuilding.net/article.pl?sid=07/10/17/1655255 |title=Ply on Frame construction |publisher=Boatbuilding.net |accessdate=2012-06-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305183809/http://www.boatbuilding.net/article.pl?sid=07%2F10%2F17%2F1655255 |archivedate=2012-03-05 }}</ref> A subdivision of the sheet plywood boat building method is known as the [[stitch and glue|stitch-and-glue]] method,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.glen-l.com/resources/glossary.html |title=Stitch and glue subdivision of sheet plywood method |publisher=Glen-l.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref> where pre-shaped panels of plywood are drawn together then edge glued and reinforced with fibreglass without the use of a frame.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boatbuilder.org/stitchandglue.htm |title=Benefits of stitch and glue |publisher=Boatbuilder.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref> Metal or plastic ties, nylon fishing line or copper wires pull curved flat panels into three-dimensional curved shapes. These hulls generally have one or more chines. Marine grade plywood of good quality is designated \"WBP\" (which stands for water- and boiled-proof) or more usually BS 1088. Australian plywood manufacturers and suppliers have issued warnings that some Asian nations are selling ply stamped BS 1088 which does not meet international standards. Specifically, they say outer plies are too thin (should be {{convert|1.2|mm|abbr=on|disp=or}} minimum) or are very thin (less than {{convert|0.5|mm|abbr=on|disp=or}}) or high-grade surface ply such as Okoume is combined with a much heavier and wider inner cores. Most high-grade marine Okoume (Gaboon) ply uses lightweight poplar inner cores. Often the 1088 stamp is blurred in the poor Asian ply so it is not clear. In Australia and New Zealand a higher-grade marine ply than BS1088 is AS2272. It requires both faces to be \"A\" quality, with even-thickness plies. The most common plywood used for this grade is plantation-grown Hoop Pine which is fine grained, very smooth, moderately light (at {{convert|570|kg/m3|lb/cuft|abbr=on|disp=or}} it is the same weight as Meranti ply and about 13% heavier than genuine poplar cored BS1088 Okoume). Hoop pine has a very high stress rating of F17, indicating high strength. Meranti (Lauan) ply has a stress rating of F14 and Okoume ply F8. Okoume ply is commonly coated with epoxy to increase strength and impact resistance as well as to exclude water. Both types of plywood construction are very popular with amateur builders, and many dinghies such as the [[Vaurien]], Cherub, [[Tolman Skiff|Tolman]], Moth and P class  (ply on frame construction) and FJs, FDs and [[Kolibri (keelboat)|Kolibri]]s (stitch-and-glue method) have been built from it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bearfacemedia.co.uk/European_Dinghies.aspx|title=European Dinghies build by amateur builders |publisher=Bearfacemedia.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clubsnautiques.com/vaurien/txt_angl.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502141046/http://www.clubsnautiques.com/vaurien/txt_angl.htm |archivedate=2009-05-02 |title=Vaurien amateur building |publisher=Clubsnautiques.com |date=2009-05-02 |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref> Another variation is tortured ply where very thin({{convert|3|mm|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and flexible (often Okoume)preshaped panels ply are bent into compound curves and sewn together. Little or no framework or longitudinal wood is used. This method is mainly confined to kayaks.\n* '''[[Cold moulding]]''' is a composite method of wooden boat building that uses two or more layers of thin wood, called veneers, oriented in different directions, resulting in a strong monocoque structure, similar to a fibreglass hull but substantially lighter. Sometimes composed of a base layer of strip planking followed by multiple veneers. Sometimes just veneers are used.<ref>\u2033The Gougeon Brothers on Boat Construction, Wood and West System Materials\u2033</ref> Cold-moulding is popular in small, medium and very large, wooden super-yachts. Using different types of wood, the builder can lighten some areas such as bow and stern and strengthen other high-stress areas. Sometimes cold-moulded hulls are protected either inside or out or both with fibreglass or similar products for impact resistance, especially when lightweight, soft timber such as cedar is used. This method lends itself to great flexibility in hull shape.<ref>[http://wiki.dtonline.org/index.php/Cold_Moulding Cold moulding website]</ref>\n\nCold-moulded refers to a type of building one-off hulls using thin strips of wood applied to a series of forms at 45-degree angles to the centerline. This method is often called double-diagonal because a minimum of two layers is recommended, each occurring at opposing 45-degree angles. The \"hot-moulded\" method of building boats, which used ovens to heat and cure the resin, has not been widely used since World War II; and now almost all curing is done at room temperature.\n\n===Metal===\n====Iron and steel====\nEither used in sheet or alternatively, [[Sheet metal|plate]] <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/shipbuildingrepair/fabricating.html |title=Welding, hot-riveting or drilling of plates |publisher=Osha.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref> for all-metal hulls or for isolated structural members. It is strong, but heavy (despite the fact that the thickness of the hull can be less). It is generally about 30% heavier than aluminium and somewhat more heavy than [[polyester]]. The material rusts unless protected from water (this is usually done by means of a covering of paint). Modern steel components are [[welding|welded]] or [[Bolted joint|bolt]]ed together. As the welding can be done very easily (with common welding equipment), and as the material is very cheap, it is a popular material with amateur builders. Also, amateur builders which are not yet well established in building steel ships may opt for [[Do it yourself|DIY]] construction kits. If steel is used, a zinc layer is often applied to coat the entire hull. It is applied after [[sandblasting]] (which is required to have a cleaned surface) and before painting. The painting is usually done with [[lead paint]] (Pb<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>). Optionally, the covering with the zinc layer may be left out, but it is generally not recommended. [[Zinc]] [[anode]]s also need to be placed on the ship's hull. Until the mid-1900s, steel sheets were [[rivet]]ed together.\n\n[[File:Punt-building-workshop-in-Oxford.jpg|thumb|A [[punt (boat)|punt]] under construction]]\n[[File:Lake Bennett boats.jpg|thumb|Wooden boats under construction during the [[Klondike Gold Rush]]]]\n\n====Aluminum====\nAluminum and aluminum alloys are used both in sheet form for all-metal hulls or for isolated structural members. Many sailing spars are frequently made of aluminium after 1960. The material requires special manufacturing techniques, construction tools and construction skills. It is the lightest material for building large boats (being 15-20% lighter than polyester and 30% lighter than steel). Aluminium is very expensive in most countries and it is usually not used by amateur builders. While it is easy to cut, aluminium is difficult to weld, and also requires heat treatments such as [[precipitation hardening|precipitation strengthening]] for most applications.  Galvanic [[corrosion]] below the waterline is a serious concern, particularly in marinas where there are other conflicting metals. Aluminium is most commonly found in yachts and power boats that are not kept permanently in the water. Aluminium yachts are particularly popular in France.\n\n====Cupronickel====\nA relatively expensive metal used only very occasionally in boatbuilding is [[cupronickel]]. Arguably the ideal metal for boat hulls, cupronickel is reasonably tough, highly resistant to corrosion in seawater, and is (because of its copper content) a very effective [[antifouling]] metal. Cupronickel may be found on the [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]]s of premium [[tugboat]]s, [[fishing boat]]s and other working [[boat]]s; and may even be used for [[propeller]]s and  [[crankshaft|propeller shafts]].\n\n===Fiberglass===\n[[Fiberglass]] ([[glass-reinforced plastic]] or GRP) is typically used for production boats because of its ability to reuse a female mould as the foundation for the shape of the boat. The resulting structure is strong in tension but often needs to be either laid up with many heavy layers of resin-saturated fiberglass or reinforced with wood or foam in order to provide stiffness. GRP hulls are largely free of corrosion though not normally fireproof. These can be solid fiberglass or of the sandwich (cored) type, in which a core of [[Ochroma pyramidale|balsa]], [[foam]] or similar material is applied after the outer layer of fiberglass is laid to the mould, but before the inner skin is laid. This is similar to the next type, composite, but is not usually classified as composite, since the core material in this case does not provide much additional strength. It does, however, increase stiffness, which means that less resin and fiberglass cloth can be used in order to save weight. Most fibreglass boats are currently made in an open mould, with fibreglass and resin applied by hand ([[hand-lay-up]] method). Some are now constructed by vacuum infusion where the fibres are laid out and resin is pulled into the mould by atmospheric pressure. This can produce stronger parts with more glass and less resin, but takes special materials and more technical knowledge. Older fibreglass boats before 1990 were often not constructed in controlled temperature buildings leading to the widespread problem of fibreglass pox, where seawater seeped through small holes and caused delamination. The name comes from the multiude of surface pits in the outer gelcoat layer which resembles smallpox. Sometimes the problem was caused by atmospheric moisture being trapped in the layup during construction in humid weather.\n\n===Composite material===\n\"Composite construction\" involves a variety of [[composite material]]s and methods: an early example was a timber carvel skin attached to a frame and deck beams made of iron. Sheet copper anti-fouling (\"copper=bottomed\") could be attached to a wooden hull provided the risk of galvanic corrosion was minimised. Fast cargo vessels once were copper-bottomed to prevent being slowed by marine fouling.  GRP and ferrocement hulls are classic composite hulls, the term \"composite\" applies also to plastics reinforced with fibers other than glass.  When a hull is being created in a female mould, the composite materials are applied to the mould in the form of a [[thermosetting plastic]] (usually [[epoxy]], polyester, or vinylester) and some kind of fiber cloth ([[fiberglass]], [[kevlar]], [[dynel]], [[carbon fiber]], etc.). These methods can give strength-to-weight ratios approaching that of aluminum, while requiring less specialized tools and construction skills.\n\n===Ferrocement===\n[[File:RHGib jpg.jpg|thumb|A 22-meter professionally built ferrocement staysail schooner]]\nFirst developed in the mid-19th century in both France and Holland, ferrocement was also used for the [[D-Day]] [[Mulberry harbour]]s. After a buzz of excitement among homebuilders in the 1960s, ferro building has since declined.\n\nFerrocement is a relatively cheap method to produce a hull, although unsuitable for commercial mass production. A steel and iron \"armature\" is built to the exact shape of the hull, ultimately being covered in galvanised chicken netting. Then, on a single day, the cement is applied by a team of plasterers. The cement:sand ratio is a very rich 4:1; do not call it concrete! As the hull thickness is typically 2.5 to 3 cms,  ferrocement is unsuitable for boats less than about 15 metres [[Length overall|LOA]] as there is a weight penalty; above that length there is no penalty. Properly plastered ferrocement boats have smooth hulls with fine lines, and amateur builders are advised to use professional plasterers to produce a smooth finish. In the 1960s and 1970s, particularly in Australia and New Zealand, the cheapness of ferro construction encouraged amateur builders to build hulls larger than they could afford, not anticipating that the fitting-out costs of a larger boat can be crippling.\n\nThe advantages of a ferro hull are:\n* cannot burn, rot, or rust; & no osmosis\n* good insulation: cool in summer, warm in winter\n* tougher than [[fiberglass|GRP]], and almost as tough as a steel vessel; (and if damaged, easily repaired almost anywhere in the world)\n* properly built, a ferro hull is as fair as a GRP hull.\n* they may be cheap to buy (see disadvantages, below)\n\nThe disadvantages are:\n* many home-built ferro boats are lumpy, overweight and ugly.\n* some early builders, realising that their creation proved to be disappointing, scuttled their vessels and fraudulently claimed insurance.\n* accordingly, ferro yachts may be difficult to sell and nigh impossible to insure.\n\n''See also'': [[concrete ship]], [[concrete canoe]].\n\n==Hull types==\n{{Further|Hull (watercraft)}}\n\nThere are many hull types, and a builder should choose the most appropriate one for the boat's intended purpose. For example, a sea-going vessel needs a hull which is more stable and robust than a hull used in rivers and canals. Hull types include:\n\n* [[Smooth curve hull]]: these are rounded and free of chines or corners.\n* [[Chine (boating)|Chined hulls]]: these are hulls have flat panels (typically plywood) which meet at a sharp angle known as the \"chine\". Chined hulls range from simple flat-bottomed boats where the topsides and bottom meet at about 110 degrees (such as [[Banks dory|banks dories]] and [[Sharpie (boat)|sharpie]]s) to skiffs where the bottom is arced rather than flat. Multi-chine hulls allow an approximation of a round hull shape.\n* [[Flat-bottomed boat|Flat-bottomed hull]]: flat-bottomed hulls are suitable for canals and non-tidal rivers. They are often shallow-draft, and may operate in shallower water. They are cheap  to build but, being less stable and having no keel to give directional stability, they are unsuitable for sea-going vessels. (However, large ships are almost always flat bottomed, having a suitably large draft to overcome the problems of small flat-bottomed boats).\n* [[Hull (watercraft)|Displacement hulls]]: a displacement hull always remains partly submerged. Such a hull has a maximum \"hull speed\" which is a function of its waterline length. An exception is the [[catamaran]], whose twin hulls are usually so fine that they do not engender a bow wave.\n* [[Planing (sailing)|Planing]] hulls: planing hulls have a shape that allows the boat to rise out of the water as the speed increases. Sail boats that plane are typical V-shaped at the bows and flat-bottomed aft. Hydroplanes are very light, flat bottomed, high powered speed boats that plane easily on flat water, but they become unstable in rough water. Powerboats designed for rough water are usually deep V-bottomed with a deadrise angle of about 20-23 degrees. The most common form is to have at least one chine to allow for stability when cornering and for a supportive surface on which to ride while planing. Planing hulls allow much higher speeds to be achieved, as they are not limited by the waterline length the way displacement hulls are. Planing hulls need sufficient power to \"reach the plane\", after which the lack of drag allows high speeds yet with reduced power consumption.\n\n==Glossary==\n{{main|Glossary of nautical terms}}\n[[File:Samos Agios Isidoros 001.jpg|thumb|Boat building in Greece]]\n[[File:Samos Agios Isidoros 002.jpg|thumb|Side view of the wooden frame]]\n<!-- ***PLEASE NOTE*** This is not a catch-all <ref></ref>of miscellaneous marine terms.  Please confine entries to objects and terms bearing on the ''construction'' of small vessels.-->\n\n*[[Anchor]]: a device for holding a boat to the seabed, typically with chain and rode.

It provides ballast for stability, and resistance to leeway moving through the water.\n*[[Kelson|Keelson]]: an internal beam fixed to the top of the keel to strengthen the joint of the upper members of the boat to the keel.\n*[[King plank]]: the central board of a foredeck. Its sides are notched to receive the tapered forward ends of deck planking so that no end grain is exposed.\n*[[Knee (construction)|Knee]]: a short L shaped piece of wood that joins or strengthens the joint in boat parts that meet between roughly 60 and 120 degrees. It may be a natural crook from a suitable wood species, sawn from a larger piece of timber, or laminated to size. Commonly used on thwarts to join topsides or keelsons to join transoms. A hanging knee sits upright beneath a thwart to support it. Hanging knees often support carlins where a full frame would be inconvenient.\n*[[Locker (cabinet)|Locker]]: an enclosed storage space\n*[[Mast (sailing)|Mast]]: a large vertical spar which supports the sails. It may be supported by standing rigging, but some rigs (such a junks) have unstayed masted.\n*[[Mast step]]: a socket to take the downward thrust of the mast and hold it in position. May be on the keel or on the deck in smaller craft.

Ribs differ from frames or futtocks in being far smaller dimensions and bent in place compared to frames or futtocks, which are normally sawn to shape, or natural crooks that are shaped to fit with an adze, axe or chisel.\n*[[Rigging]]: standing rigging (either \"stays\" or shrouds\") are the wire cables or rods that support the mast(s).  Running rigging are the ropes (\"sheets\") to control the sails. \n*[[Rowlock]] (pronounced \"rollock\";(also \"oarlock\"): a 'U' shaped metal device that secures an oar and acts as a fulcrum during the motion of rowing. \n*[[Rudder]]: a hinged vertical plate at the stern for steering a craft. There may be more than one rudder.\n*[[Sampson post]]: a strong vertical post which supports a ship's [[windlass]] and the heel of its [[bowsprit]], also used to making off mooring lines.\n*[[Scupper]]s: gaps in the bulwarks permitting water to drain off the deck.\n*[[Shackle]]: a U-shaped fitting secured by a removable pin for securely connecting chains, lines, and other fittings.  Known as a \"snap shackle\" when fitted with a spring-loaded pin.\n*[[Sheave box]]: a plastic or stainless steel box that holds a pulley that is fixed in position as on a mast head.\n*[[Sheer (ship)|Sheer]]: the generally curved shape of the upper hull. It is traditionally lowest amidships to maximize freeboard at the ends of the hull. Sheer can be reverse, higher in the middle to maximize space inside, or straight or a combination of shapes.\n*[[Sheet (sailing)|Sheet]]: a line which controls the clew of a sail.\n*[[Skeg]]: a vertical blade beneath the hull, typically to support and protect the rudder and to promote the rudder's efficiency by preventing \"stalling\".\n*[[Spar (sailing)|Spar]]: s length of timber, aluminium, steel or carbon fibre of approximately round or pear shaped cross-section which supports a sail or sails. Spars include the mast, boom, gaff, yard, bowsprit, prod, boomkin, pole and dolphin striker.\n*[[Sole (foot)|Sole]]: the floor of a cabin or cockpit.\n*[[Spinnaker]] (or \"kite\"): a large, lightweight, down-wind sail used on fore and aft rigged yachts such as sloops to dramatically increase sail area typically used running with the wind.\n*[[Spring (nautical)|Spring]]: the amount of fore and aft curvature in the keel.\n*[[Stanchion]]s: a post for holding life lines on a deck.\n*[[Stainless steel]]: a corrosion-resistant alloy of mild steel and small percentages of such metals as copper, chromium, molybdenum, and nickel.  Common alloys are \"18/8\" (known as \"surgical stainless steel\") and \"316\" (\"marine grade\"), which contains more salt-water resistant nickel.\n*[[Stays (nautical)|Stays]]/[[shroud (sailing)|shrouds]]: standing or running rigging which holds a spar in position (e.g. forestay, backstay, bobstay). Formerly made of rope, typically of braided stainless steel wire, occasionally solid metal rod.\n*[[Stem (ship)|Stem]]: a continuation of the keel upwards at the bow where the two sides of the hull meet.\n*[[Stern]]: the aftmost part of a boat, often ending in a transom.\n*[[Stern sheets]] a flat area or deck, inboard of the transom in a small boat. It may contain hatches to access below decks or provide storage on deck for life saving equipment.\n*[[Strake]]: planking, running from the \"garboard\" strake affixed to the keel to the \"sheer\" strake below the caprail.\n*[[Clinker (boat building)|Stringer]] (also \"batten\"): a long relatively thin, knot free length of wood, running fore and aft, often used to reinforce planking on the inside of the hull.\n*[[Synthetic rope]]: lines manufactured from chained chemicals.  The four most common are: polyester (including brand names Dacron and Terylene), a strong, low stretch line, usually plaited (braided) used for running rigging; nylon, a strong but elastic line resistant to shock loads, best suited for mooring lines and anchor warps. It is usually laid (twisted) so to make it easier to grip when hauling; polypropylene, a light, cheap, slippery, buoyant line, typically laid, which is by far the weakest of the four, and deteriorates when exposed to sunlight. Commonly used on commercial fishing boats using nets; and Kevlar, an extremely strong and expensive fibre with almost no stretch, usually braided and best suited for halyards.\n*[[Taff rail]]: a railing at the extreme stern of a vessel.\n*[[Thwart]]: a transverse member used to maintain the shape of the topsides of a small boat, often doubling as a seat.\n*[[Tiller]]: a forward-facing attached to the rudder allowing a helmsman to steer a boat. On a dinghy, the tiller may have a hinged extension called a \"jigger\".\n*[[Toe rail]]: an upright longitudinal strip of wood surrounding a deck near the sheer, especially forward, for safety and to provide purchase when a boat is heeled.\n*[[Topping Lift]]: a line running from a cleat on the mast through a block at the masthead and down to the aft end of a boom for supporting the boom when not in use or when reefing. \n*[[Topsides (nautical)|Topsides]]: the side planking of a boat from the waterline to the sheerstrake.\n*[[Transom (nautical)|Transom]]: a vertical part of the hull at the stern. Transoms provide width and sadditional buoyancy at the stern. Dinghies may attach an outboard motor to the transom.\n*Warp: anchor line, traditionally made of stiff natural fibre such as hemp, today of stronger, lighter, synthetic fibres such as laid nylon, prized for its elasticity in absorbing shock loads on an anchor. \n*[[Winch]]: a geared device providing both friction and mechanical advantage in sail trimming, hoisting large sails, and retrieving an anchor. Some winches are self-tailing, allowing efficient one-man usage, others electrically powered.\n*[[Wind pennant]]: a small pivoting masthead wind indicator.\n*[[Yard (sailing)|Yard]]: a horizontal spar on a square rigged ship fitted to the forward side of a mast, holding a square sail forward of the shrouds.

In his book ''Rivolta contro il mondo moderno'' (''Revolt against the Modern World''; 1934) Evola writes that in the \"Golden Age\" the center of the \"Olympic civilization\" that spread across the Eurasian continent was in a \"Boreal\" or Nordic \"region\". The [[Thule-Gesellschaft]], a secret society of which the [[Nazi]] [[Heinrich Himmler]] was a member, believed that the [[Aryan race]] came from the mythical northern province of Hyperborea.\n\nIn the [[discourse]] of twenty-first-century [[postmodern]] politics, the term ''boreal'' is used by politicians like [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] in [[France]] and [[Thierry Baudet]] in [[The Netherlands]] to refer vaguely and semi-[[myth|mythically]] to Northern Europe and its ethnic groups, culture and languages. The term is used to imply a white cultural and political space \"from [[Gibraltar]] to [[Vladivostok]]\", as opposed to the [[international migration|migrating]] [[minorities]], in an attempt to avoid openly [[racism|racist]] connotations. Thus the term \"boreal\" is used as a [[euphemism|euphemistic]] way of saying \"white\" when referring to [[White people]]. Le Pen's statements about a \"boreal Europe\" and \"white world\" contributed to him being expelled by [[Marine Le Pen]] in 2015 as a member of the [[Front National]].<ref>[https://www.counter-currents.com/2015/04/jean-marie-le-pens-rivarol-interview/ ''\u201cWe must save Boreal Europe & the white world\u201d'': Jean-Marie Le Pen\u2019s Rivarol Interview] Counter-Currents Publishing, 9 april 2015</ref><ref>[http://www.rtl.fr/actu/politique/race-blanche-pour-jean-marie-le-pen-nadine-morano-a-enonce-une-evidence-historique-7779898077 ''Race blanche\" : pour Jean-Marie Le Pen, Nadine Morano a \"\u00e9nonc\u00e9 une \u00e9vidence historique'']</ref> \n\nThe term has also been used by [[Russian nationalism|Russian-nationalist movements]] since the 1990s after the [[German reunification|fall of the Berlin wall]] as an indication of ethnic [[Russians]]. \n\nIn the Netherlands, [[Forum for Democracy]] (FvD) leader Thierry Baudet introduced the word in a political context.<ref>''[https://decorrespondent.nl/7955/hoe-thierry-baudet-aan-de-lippen-hing-van-jean-marie-le-pen/811713530980-29774dcf Hoe Thierry Baudet aan de lippen hing van Jean-Marie Le Pen]''</ref> At the first party congress of the FvD in 2017, he spoke about \"our boreal Europe\"; in the victory speech he gave to his followers after the [[2019 Dutch provincial elections]], about \"our boreal world\".<ref>''[https://www.dutchnews.nl/news/2019/03/on-owls-women-and-the-boreal-world-10-things-thierry-baudet-has-said/ On owls, women and the boreal world: 10 things Thierry Baudet has said]''</ref><ref>''[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/03/thierry-baudet-dutch-rightwing-populism Meet Thierry Baudet, the suave new face of Dutch rightwing populism]''</ref><ref>''[https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/03/28/the-new-face-of-the-dutch-far-right-fvd-thierry-baudet-netherlands-pvv-geert-wilders The New Face of the Dutch Far-Right - Thierry Baudet once called politicians brain-dead.

Collingwood won its first [[List of Australian Football League premiers|premiership]] in [[1902 VFL Grand Final|1902]], defeating {{AFL Ess}} by 33 points.\n\n===1920s and 1930s: Four consecutive premierships===\n[[File:Jock Mchale.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Jock McHale coached the club to four consecutive Grand Final victories.]]\nCollingwood was the most successful club of the 1920s and 1930s, appearing in 13 out of a possible 20 Grand Finals during the period. Collingwood were premiers six times during this time, including four consecutive premierships between [[1927 VFL season|1927]] and [[1930 VFL season|1930]], a VFL/AFL record, and two consecutive premierships in [[1935 VFL season|1935]] and [[1936 VFL season|1936]]. The club's coach during this period was [[Jock McHale]], who served as coach from 1912 to 1949. Collingwood also had three [[Brownlow Medal]]lists during the period, with [[Syd Coventry]] winning in [[1927 VFL season|1927]], [[Albert Collier]] in [[1929 VFL season|1929]] and [[Harry Collier]] in [[1930 VFL season|1930]]. The club's ruthlessly successful period later earned the club the nickname \"The Machine\". American journalist and author Sam Walker included the Machine team in his book ''The Captain Class'', which listed some the author's greatest teams in the history of world sport.<ref name=Hello12>{{cite web|url=https://forever.collingwoodfc.com.au/machine-named-among-worlds-best-ever-sporting-teams/|title=Machine named among world's best ever sporting teams|work=forever.collingwoodfc.com.au}}</ref> The Collingwood team of 1927\u201330 not only won four straight premierships, but did so with a winning percentage of around 86% across the four seasons, and an average winning margin of about five goals.

Collingwood lost two Grand Finals to Melbourne in this decade, but bounced back to win premierships in 1953 and 1958. Collingwood's 1958 premiership is much cherished by the club as it prevented Melbourne from equalling Collingwood's record four premierships in a row.\n\nThe 1958 premiership was however to be Collingwood's last for 32 years, as the club was to suffer a string of Grand Final defeats in coming decades.\n\n===1959\u201389: \"Colliwobbles\"===\n{{main|Colliwobbles}}\nA string of eight Grand Final losses, often by narrow margins, between 1960 and 1981 gave rise to a perception that the club was prone to \"choking\", a phenomenon wittily dubbed \"Colliwobbles\".<ref>[http://www.heraldsun.com.au/opinion/lets-banish-memories-of-colliwobbles-forever/story-e6frfhqf-1225929137935 Let's banish memories of Colliwobbles forever] The Herald Sun, 24 September 2010</ref><ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/sport/putting-a-price-on-colliwobbles-20100811-11zpj.html Putting a price on Colliwobbles] The Melbourne Age, 12 August 2010</ref><ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/its-still-neck-and-neck-after-44-years-20100925-15rpk.html?rand=1285423503336?autostart=1 It's still neck and neck after 44 years] The Melbourne Age, 25 September 2010</ref> Whether this perception is accurate remains a subject of debate;<ref name=footyalmanac>[http://footyalmanac.com.au/?p=14663 Colliwobbles: fact or fantasy?] ''Footy Almanac''</ref> having only won one and drawn one of its last six Grand Finals.

The sight of club great [[Darren Millane]], who died in a car-crash one year later, holding the ball aloft in triumph at the final siren is one of the indelible images of the match.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.collingwoodfc.com.au/news/2015-07-29/1990-premiership-exhibition|title=Re-live the triumph \u2013 1990 Premiership exhibition|work=Collingwood Football Club|date=29 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nAfter the drought-breaking premiership, the club lapsed into a state of decline for the remainder of the decade, culminating with the club's second [[wooden spoon]] in 1999. The Magpies returned to finals, though were quickly eliminated, in the [[1992 AFL season|1992 season]] against [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]] and in [[1994 AFL season|1994]] against [[West Coast Eagles|West Coast]]. Matthews left as head coach at the end of the [[1995 AFL season|1995 season]] and was replaced at the start of the following year by 1990 premiership captain [[Tony Shaw]], who had only retired from football 18 months earlier. Mid-table finishes under Shaw were achieved for the next two seasons, before poor results in 1998 and 1999 saw Shaw announce his resignation.\n\n===2000\u201311: The Malthouse era===\nMedia personality, sports journalist and administrator [[Eddie McGuire]] was elected [[List of Collingwood Football Club presidents|President]] in October 1998. He oversaw the installation of new head coach [[Michael Malthouse]] in October 1999, whose appointment proved to be a masterstroke in reviving the club on-field. Under Malthouse, the acquisition and emergence of players such as [[Paul Licuria]], [[Alan Didak]], [[Anthony Rocca]] and [[Nathan Buckley]] resulted in Collingwood quickly moving up the ladder in [[2000 AFL season|2000]] and [[2001 AFL season|2001]], only narrowly missing the finals in the latter year. Collingwood met reigning premiers the [[Brisbane Lions]] in the [[2002 AFL Grand Final|2002 Grand Final]] and were regarded as massive underdogs, eventually falling just 9 points short of an improbable premiership. Buckley, the captain, became just the third player to win the [[Norm Smith Medal]] as best afield in the Grand Final despite being a member of the losing side. Despite a very successful home-and-away next season, they were again defeated by the Lions in the [[2003 AFL Grand Final|2003 Grand Final]], this time in thoroughly convincingly fashion.\n\nFollowing those Grand Final losses, Collingwood struggled for the next two years, finishing 13th in 2004 and second-last in 2005; the latter meant Collingwood was eligible for a priority pick which the club used to recruit [[Dale Thomas (footballer)|Dale Thomas]]. Collingwood made a return to the finals in 2006, finishing fifth, but were defeated by the [[Western Bulldogs]] by 41 points in its elimination final.

Having earned a preliminary final against {{AFL Gee}}, Collingwood lost to the eventual premiers, by five points in one of the most memorable preliminary finals in over a decade. Nathan Buckley would announce his retirement at season's end after playing just five games in 2007 due to injury.\n\nCollingwood finished eighth in [[2008 AFL season|2008]] and were assigned an away final against {{AFL Ade}} at [[AAMI Stadium]]. After at one point trailing in the match, Collingwood went on to end Adelaide's season and earn a semi-final meeting against {{AFL StK}}. Having defeated the Saints in both their regular season meetings, Collingwood lost convincingly, ending their 2008 season. The [[2009 AFL season|2009 season]] saw Collingwood finish inside the top-four for the first time since 2003, but in the qualifying final were beaten by minor premiers St Kilda convincingly. Having won a second chance, Collingwood struggled against Adelaide for the second year in a row before John Anthony kicked the match-winning goal with a minute left to send them into another preliminary final meeting with Geelong. But the season ended abruptly for the Magpies, with a 73-point loss to Geelong.\n\nIn 2010, Collingwood finished as minor premiers, and after wins in the qualifying and preliminary finals, reached the first [[2010 AFL Grand Final|Grand Final]] against {{AFL StK}}. The match finished as a draw, forcing the first [[grand final replay]] in 33 years. Collingwood won the replay by 56 points. Key defensive player [[Nick Maxwell]] captained the club to victory and midfielder [[Scott Pendlebury]] (who had already won his first of eventually three [[Anzac Day match|Anzac medals]] earlier in the year) was awarded the [[Norm Smith Medal]]. The club won a second consecutive minor premiership in 2011, and qualified for the [[2011 AFL Grand Final|Grand Final]] after a three-point victory against Hawthorn in the preliminary final. However, Collingwood was then beaten by Geelong by 38 points in the decider, after trailing by seven points at three-quarter time.

The club qualified for finals once more in 2013, though were surprisingly eliminated in the first week by underdogs [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] at home. The result prompted the Magpies coaching staff to begin making radical changes to the club's playing list, which saw premiership players [[Heath Shaw]], [[Sharrod Wellingham]], [[Heritier Lumumba]] among others leave for other clubs or retire. Over the next four years, younger talent was drafted but the club's win-loss recorded continued to deteriorate. Collingwood failed to make finals from 2014 through to the end of the [[2017 AFL season|2017 season]], progressively sliding down the ladder each year. Buckley came under intense media pressure to resign or be sacked from his position, though club administrators elected to grant him a two-year extension to his contract in October 2017 after a broad-ranging internal review.<ref name=Buckleyarticle1>{{cite web|url=https://themongrelpunt.com/afl/2018/10/17/an-imperfect-perfection-the-transformation-of-nathan-buckley|title=An Imperfect Perfection \u2013 The Transformation of Nathan Buckley|work=The Mongrel Punt|date=1 June 2019}}{{Dead link|date=October 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe emergence of new-generation players such as [[Taylor Adams]], [[Adam Treloar]] and [[Jordan De Goey]], alongside key talls [[Brodie Grundy]] and [[Mason Cox]] mixed well with veterans Pendlebury and [[Steele Sidebottom]].

The all white jumper, with the three black vertical stripes is the iconic strip that the club is most associated with.  The current incarnation of the guernsey is mostly black, with white stripes on the front and lower half of the back, and white numbers. The main clash guernsey is the reverse of this: mostly white, with black stripes and black numbers, worn in away matches against clubs with a predominantly dark guernsey such as [[Fremantle|Fremantle Football Club]] and [[Port Adelaide|Port Adelaide Football Club]]. A secondary clash guernsey was introduced in 2011 and is used only in matches against {{AFL Nor}} due to similarity between the two uniforms. The alternate uniform is black with only two white stripes on each side instead of three.\n\nTraditionally, Collingwood has worn a white guernsey with black stripes.

In Round 8 2002 Collingwood beat Brisbane by three points in a tense match in front of 46,279 people at [[Colonial Stadium]]. This victory over the reigning premier took the Magpies to equal top of the league table (2nd on percentage) with Brisbane. The rivalry grew with the 2002 Grand Final when Brisbane beat Collingwood by nine points. The rivalry grew again in 2003 when the two clubs clashed on four occasions. The Lions defeated the Magpies at [[The Gabba]] in Round 4 before thrashing them in Heritage Round \u2013 Round 19 at the MCG. Collingwood then defeated Brisbane in the Qualifying Final with [[Alan Didak]] ensuring victory late in the final quarter, with two goals from the boundary line.

This included the 1958 Grand Final where Collingwood's victory prevented Melbourne from equalling Collingwood's record of four premierships in succession (1927\u20131930). The old rivalry with [[Melbourne Football Club|Melbourne]] has faded in recent decades due to Melbourne not enjoying the same level of on-field success, however, it remains strong and is an annual scheduled fixture on the Queens Birthday public holiday.\n\n==== [[AFL team rivalries#Essendon v Collingwood|Essendon]] ====\n[[AFL team rivalries#Essendon v Collingwood|Collingwood's rivalry with Essendon]] has become more significant since 1995, when the first [[Anzac Day clash|ANZAC Day clash]] took place. After the 2019 match, Collingwood have won this contest 15 times and Essendon 9 times, with the first match being drawn.\n\n==== [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] ====\nThe rivalry with [[Port Adelaide FC|Port Adelaide]] stems from them being known as the Magpies in their local [[South Australian National Football League|SANFL]] competition before switching to the Power when entering the League in 1997. Feelings were heightened when Port midfielder [[Kane Cornes]] 'flipped the bird' at [[Nick Davis (footballer)|Nick Davis]] following the Power's five-point victory over the Magpies at [[AAMI Stadium]] in Round 9, 2002, only moments after [[Anthony Rocca]] had missed the opportunity to tie the scores. [[Jarrod Molloy]] and [[Brodie Holland]] remonstrated with Cornes after the match, with a feeling of hostility lingering after the two sides had left the field. Collingwood unexpectedly beat the Power in the Qualifying Final that season, also at AAMI stadium. Collingwood again defeated Port Adelaide in the 2003 Preliminary Final at the MCG. This added to the 'choking' phenomenon directed at the Power. The off-field battle over Port's desire to wear its black and white \"prison bar\" guernsey has been a major talking point, especially between 2002 and 2007, which added to the rivalry. A resolution was reached in favour of Collingwood.\n\n==== [[AFL team rivalries#Collingwood v Geelong|Geelong]] ====\n[[AFL team rivalries#Collingwood v Geelong|Games between Collingwood and Geelong]] have become highly anticipated since 2007. In Round 15 Geelong beat Collingwood by 16 points in a high-quality match. In the Preliminary final Collingwood surprised many when they came within 5 points of the eventual premiers. In 2008 Collingwood thrashed Geelong by 86 points\u201420.14 (134)- 7.6 (48) causing Geelong's only loss of the year. In 2009, the sides again met in the preliminary final, but despite high hopes the Cats, who would again win the premiership, won by 73 points in front of another massive crowd of 87,258.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lovett|2010|p=92}}</ref> In 2010, the two sides emerged as the favourites for the flag and twice met in front of blockbuster crowds at the MCG when they were placed 1st and 2nd on the ladder\u2014with the results evenly split. They again met in a Preliminary final, this time a resounding win to Collingwood by 41 points. In 2011, both teams were undefeated going into their round eight 'blockbuster' at the 'G. Geelong won by three points, after a controversial advantage was not paid to Magpie Scott Pendlebury in the dying minutes. Pendlebury kicked a goal and would have put the Pies in front, but the free kick was contentiously called back and Geelong managed to whisk the ball away. In the round 24 match, Geelong thumped the Magpies by a record margin of 96 points, which was also Collingwood's biggest ever loss at the MCG. The 2011 Grand Final against the Cats concluded with a 38-point loss for the Pies.\n\n===Supporters===\n[[File:Magpie mascot.jpg|thumb|200px|Collingwood Magpies mascot]]\nCollingwood is a working-class suburb and the Collingwood Football Club supporter base traditionally came from the working class (though its supporter base today goes far beyond). Many of the club's supporters who regularly attend games still come from the working class or from lower socio-economic groups, leading to jokes from supporters of other clubs which typically stereotype their Collingwood counterparts as poor, crude and ignorant.<ref>{{cite web|last=Humphrys|first=Elizabeth|title=Beyond a joke: Bogan loathing bring us all to shame|url=http://www.abc.net.au/unleashed/3571876.html|work=The Drum|publisher=ABC|accessdate=8 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003204636/http://www.abc.net.au/unleashed/3571876.html|archive-date=3 October 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nCollingwood is traditionally reviled by non-Collingwood supporters (\"You either love 'em or you hate 'em\"). The dislike of the club by outsiders is said to have originated during the 1920s and 1930s, a period of great success for the club which drew the envy and resentment of other clubs. In this period, Collingwood was also perceived as a Catholic and Irish club, at a time when these groups were looked down upon by the rest of Australian society and subjected to a considerable degree of social exclusion.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cordy|first=Neil|title=AFL AFL DEPARTMENT OF TRADE NAB CUP SHOWS VIDEO GWS Giants supporters are about to learn why footy fans love to hate Collingwood, writes Neil Cordy|url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/afl/afl-premiership/gws-giants-supporters-are-about-to-learn-why-footy-fans-love-to-hate-collingwood-writes-neil-cordy/story-e6frf3e3-1226436342075}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Sapienza|first=Joseph|title=Everybody hates Collingwood ... but why?|url=http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/everybody-hates-collingwood--but-why-20100921-15l4l.html|work=The Age|accessdate=8 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nUntil recent years, racial vilification of opposition players in VFL/AFL games was not uncommon.

Collingwood.\n\n===Off field===\nCollingwood was one of the last clubs to abandon its traditional stadium, the famous inner-city [[Victoria Park, Melbourne|Victoria Park]]. Collingwood now plays home games at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]]. It now also has its headquarters situated in the [[Melbourne Sports and Entertainment Center|former Glasshouse Entertainment Centre]]. Due to a sponsorship deal, this facility is known as 'The Holden Centre'.\n\nCollingwood continues to be financially viable through the loyal support of its huge following and numerous sponsors. After finishing 2nd in 2002 and 2003 the team fell to 13th and 15th (out of 16) in 2004 and 2005 respectively. This trend has plagued the club since the glory days of pre-World War II VFL football. Since 1958, the club has won only two VFL/AFL Premiership (the inaugural AFL Premiership in 1990, and in 2010). Despite this, the club still has won more individual games, more finals and made more grand final appearances than any other club.\n\nOn 9 March 2007, former Collingwood and Fitzroy defender [[Gary Pert]] was appointed the Magpies' CEO, seven weeks after Greg Swann departed for Carlton. In accepting the key Magpie post, Pert quit as a club director and as managing director of Channel 9 in Melbourne. In a press conference, it was stated that Collingwood has budgeted to turn over about $50&nbsp;million this year. McGuire hopes the new administration will soon double that figure. \"A finance administration review has come up with how we are going to turn Collingwood in to its next phase of its life\", McGuire said. \"What do we do to make ourselves go from a $45&nbsp;million a year turnover business to a $100&nbsp;million turnover business? \"They sound like big figures but in 1999 we turned over $13&nbsp;million, so that is where we are heading as a football club.\"\n\nThe club made an operating profit of $5.23 million for the 2013 season, revenue increased from $2.6 million to more than $75 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brw.com.au/p/marketing/collingwood_afl_club_builds_build_wIkGxHPlYSn6K0EX6MJTgK|title=Collingwood AFL&nbsp;club builds build TV studio for digital marketing expansion|date=8 January 2014|access-date=17 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923223834/http://www.brw.com.au/p/marketing/collingwood_afl_club_builds_build_wIkGxHPlYSn6K0EX6MJTgK|archive-date=23 September 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOn 24 July 2017, Pert resigned from his position as CEO of the club, with Peter Murphy replacing him as an interim CEO.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/collingwood-chief-executive-gary-pert-resigns-20170724-gxhbu4.html|title=Collingwood chief executive Gary Pert resigns|first=Jon|last=Pierik|newspaper=[[The Age]]|date=24 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Sponsorship===\nThe Collingwood guernsey is the most valuable sports sponsorship in Australia.<ref name=\"Magpies guernsey most valuable\">{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/business/afls-success-in-black-and-white-20110308-1bmk6.html |title=Magpies guernsey most valuable |work=The Age |location=Australia |date=9 March 2011 |accessdate=22 September 2011}}</ref> Collingwood has different guernsey sponsors for home and away matches, generating an estimated $6.3&nbsp;million worth of media exposure for the primary sponsor and $5.7&nbsp;million for the secondary sponsor.

Formed in 1892 in the then-working class [[Melbourne]] suburb of [[Collingwood, Victoria|Collingwood]], the club played in the [[Victorian Football League|Victorian Football Association]] (VFA) before joining seven other teams in 1896 to found the breakaway Victorian Football League (now the national AFL). Originally based at [[Victoria Park, Melbourne|Victoria Park]], Collingwood now plays its home games at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] with its training and administrative headquarters located at [[Olympic Park Oval]] and the [[Melbourne Sports and Entertainment Centre|Holden Centre]].\n\nCollingwood has played in a record 44 [[AFL Grand Final|VFL/AFL Grand Finals]] (including rematches), winning 15, drawing two and losing 27 (also a record).

Its iconic home [[guernsey (Australian rules football)|guernsey]] consists of black and white stripes, matching the colours of the [[Australian magpie]]. Historically the club's main rivals have been cross-town clubs [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]], [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]] and [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]].

Collingwood won its first [[List of Australian Football League premiers|premiership]] in [[1902 VFL Grand Final|1902]], defeating {{AFL Ess}} by 33 points.\n\n===1920s and 1930s: Four consecutive premierships===\n[[File:Jock Mchale.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Jock McHale coached the club to four consecutive Grand Final victories.]]\nCollingwood was the most successful club of the 1920s and 1930s, appearing in 13 out of a possible 20 Grand Finals during the period. Collingwood were premiers six times during this time, including four consecutive premierships between [[1927 VFL season|1927]] and [[1930 VFL season|1930]], a VFL/AFL record, and two consecutive premierships in [[1935 VFL season|1935]] and [[1936 VFL season|1936]]. The club's coach during this period was [[Jock McHale]], who served as coach from 1912 to 1949. Collingwood also had three [[Brownlow Medal]]lists during the period, with [[Syd Coventry]] winning in [[1927 VFL season|1927]], [[Albert Collier]] in [[1929 VFL season|1929]] and [[Harry Collier]] in [[1930 VFL season|1930]]. The club's ruthlessly successful period later earned the club the nickname \"The Machine\". American journalist and author Sam Walker included the Machine team in his book ''The Captain Class'', which listed some the author's greatest teams in the history of world sport.<ref name=Hello12>{{cite web|url=https://forever.collingwoodfc.com.au/machine-named-among-worlds-best-ever-sporting-teams/|title=Machine named among world's best ever sporting teams|work=forever.collingwoodfc.com.au}}</ref> The Collingwood team of 1927\u201330 not only won four straight premierships, but did so with a winning percentage of around 86% across the four seasons, and an average winning margin of about five goals. In 1929 they also became the only team in history to go through a home-and-away season undefeated.<ref name=Hello12/> Collingwood remains the only club in the history of the VFL/AFL to have [[List of VFL/AFL premiers|won the premiership]] on four successive occasions.\n\n===1950s: Melbourne rivalry===\n\nIn the 1950s, rival club [[Melbourne Football Club|Melbourne]] enjoyed an era of unprecedented success, winning five premierships in six years (the last coming in 1960, and having been runner up in 1954). Collingwood lost two Grand Finals to Melbourne in this decade, but bounced back to win premierships in 1953 and 1958. Collingwood's 1958 premiership is much cherished by the club as it prevented Melbourne from equalling Collingwood's record four premierships in a row.\n\nThe 1958 premiership was however to be Collingwood's last for 32 years, as the club was to suffer a string of Grand Final defeats in coming decades.\n\n===1959\u201389: \"Colliwobbles\"===\n{{main|Colliwobbles}}\nA string of eight Grand Final losses, often by narrow margins, between 1960 and 1981 gave rise to a perception that the club was prone to \"choking\", a phenomenon wittily dubbed \"Colliwobbles\".<ref>[http://www.heraldsun.com.au/opinion/lets-banish-memories-of-colliwobbles-forever/story-e6frfhqf-1225929137935 Let's banish memories of Colliwobbles forever] The Herald Sun, 24 September 2010</ref><ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/sport/putting-a-price-on-colliwobbles-20100811-11zpj.html Putting a price on Colliwobbles] The Melbourne Age, 12 August 2010</ref><ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/its-still-neck-and-neck-after-44-years-20100925-15rpk.html?rand=1285423503336?autostart=1 It's still neck and neck after 44 years] The Melbourne Age, 25 September 2010</ref> Whether this perception is accurate remains a subject of debate;<ref name=footyalmanac>[http://footyalmanac.com.au/?p=14663 Colliwobbles: fact or fantasy?] ''Footy Almanac''</ref> having only won one and drawn one of its last six Grand Finals.

The sight of club great [[Darren Millane]], who died in a car-crash one year later, holding the ball aloft in triumph at the final siren is one of the indelible images of the match.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.collingwoodfc.com.au/news/2015-07-29/1990-premiership-exhibition|title=Re-live the triumph \u2013 1990 Premiership exhibition|work=Collingwood Football Club|date=29 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nAfter the drought-breaking premiership, the club lapsed into a state of decline for the remainder of the decade, culminating with the club's second [[wooden spoon]] in 1999. The Magpies returned to finals, though were quickly eliminated, in the [[1992 AFL season|1992 season]] against [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]] and in [[1994 AFL season|1994]] against [[West Coast Eagles|West Coast]]. Matthews left as head coach at the end of the [[1995 AFL season|1995 season]] and was replaced at the start of the following year by 1990 premiership captain [[Tony Shaw]], who had only retired from football 18 months earlier. Mid-table finishes under Shaw were achieved for the next two seasons, before poor results in 1998 and 1999 saw Shaw announce his resignation.\n\n===2000\u201311: The Malthouse era===\nMedia personality, sports journalist and administrator [[Eddie McGuire]] was elected [[List of Collingwood Football Club presidents|President]] in October 1998. He oversaw the installation of new head coach [[Michael Malthouse]] in October 1999, whose appointment proved to be a masterstroke in reviving the club on-field. Under Malthouse, the acquisition and emergence of players such as [[Paul Licuria]], [[Alan Didak]], [[Anthony Rocca]] and [[Nathan Buckley]] resulted in Collingwood quickly moving up the ladder in [[2000 AFL season|2000]] and [[2001 AFL season|2001]], only narrowly missing the finals in the latter year. Collingwood met reigning premiers the [[Brisbane Lions]] in the [[2002 AFL Grand Final|2002 Grand Final]] and were regarded as massive underdogs, eventually falling just 9 points short of an improbable premiership. Buckley, the captain, became just the third player to win the [[Norm Smith Medal]] as best afield in the Grand Final despite being a member of the losing side. Despite a very successful home-and-away next season, they were again defeated by the Lions in the [[2003 AFL Grand Final|2003 Grand Final]], this time in thoroughly convincingly fashion.\n\nFollowing those Grand Final losses, Collingwood struggled for the next two years, finishing 13th in 2004 and second-last in 2005; the latter meant Collingwood was eligible for a priority pick which the club used to recruit [[Dale Thomas (footballer)|Dale Thomas]]. Collingwood made a return to the finals in 2006, finishing fifth, but were defeated by the [[Western Bulldogs]] by 41 points in its elimination final. A loss to {{AFL Ess}} late in the season was to cost them the double chance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collingwoodfc.com.au/news/2012-08-30/beyond-2000-essendon|title=Beyond 2000 \u2013 Essendon|publisher=Collingwood FC|first=Luke|last=Mason|date=30 August 2012|accessdate=10 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180524151821/http://www.collingwoodfc.com.au/news/2012-08-30/beyond-2000-essendon|archive-date=24 May 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2006-08-11/bombers-shock-magpies/1237690|title=Bombers shock Magpies|publisher=ABC News ([[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]])|date=11 August 2006|accessdate=10 June 2017}}</ref> The 2007 season saw them finish sixth on the ladder at season's conclusion, and in the finals they knocked out the grand finalists of the past two years, [[Sydney Swans|Sydney]], in the elimination final and then [[West Coast Eagles|West Coast]] in overtime at [[Subiaco Oval]] in the semi-final. Having earned a preliminary final against {{AFL Gee}}, Collingwood lost to the eventual premiers, by five points in one of the most memorable preliminary finals in over a decade. Nathan Buckley would announce his retirement at season's end after playing just five games in 2007 due to injury.\n\nCollingwood finished eighth in [[2008 AFL season|2008]] and were assigned an away final against {{AFL Ade}} at [[AAMI Stadium]]. After at one point trailing in the match, Collingwood went on to end Adelaide's season and earn a semi-final meeting against {{AFL StK}}. Having defeated the Saints in both their regular season meetings, Collingwood lost convincingly, ending their 2008 season. The [[2009 AFL season|2009 season]] saw Collingwood finish inside the top-four for the first time since 2003, but in the qualifying final were beaten by minor premiers St Kilda convincingly. Having won a second chance, Collingwood struggled against Adelaide for the second year in a row before John Anthony kicked the match-winning goal with a minute left to send them into another preliminary final meeting with Geelong. But the season ended abruptly for the Magpies, with a 73-point loss to Geelong.\n\nIn 2010, Collingwood finished as minor premiers, and after wins in the qualifying and preliminary finals, reached the first [[2010 AFL Grand Final|Grand Final]] against {{AFL StK}}. The match finished as a draw, forcing the first [[grand final replay]] in 33 years. Collingwood won the replay by 56 points. Key defensive player [[Nick Maxwell]] captained the club to victory and midfielder [[Scott Pendlebury]] (who had already won his first of eventually three [[Anzac Day match|Anzac medals]] earlier in the year) was awarded the [[Norm Smith Medal]]. The club won a second consecutive minor premiership in 2011, and qualified for the [[2011 AFL Grand Final|Grand Final]] after a three-point victory against Hawthorn in the preliminary final. However, Collingwood was then beaten by Geelong by 38 points in the decider, after trailing by seven points at three-quarter time.

The club qualified for finals once more in 2013, though were surprisingly eliminated in the first week by underdogs [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] at home. The result prompted the Magpies coaching staff to begin making radical changes to the club's playing list, which saw premiership players [[Heath Shaw]], [[Sharrod Wellingham]], [[Heritier Lumumba]] among others leave for other clubs or retire. Over the next four years, younger talent was drafted but the club's win-loss recorded continued to deteriorate. Collingwood failed to make finals from 2014 through to the end of the [[2017 AFL season|2017 season]], progressively sliding down the ladder each year. Buckley came under intense media pressure to resign or be sacked from his position, though club administrators elected to grant him a two-year extension to his contract in October 2017 after a broad-ranging internal review.<ref name=Buckleyarticle1>{{cite web|url=https://themongrelpunt.com/afl/2018/10/17/an-imperfect-perfection-the-transformation-of-nathan-buckley|title=An Imperfect Perfection \u2013 The Transformation of Nathan Buckley|work=The Mongrel Punt|date=1 June 2019}}{{Dead link|date=October 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe emergence of new-generation players such as [[Taylor Adams]], [[Adam Treloar]] and [[Jordan De Goey]], alongside key talls [[Brodie Grundy]] and [[Mason Cox]] mixed well with veterans Pendlebury and [[Steele Sidebottom]].

The all white jumper, with the three black vertical stripes is the iconic strip that the club is most associated with.  The current incarnation of the guernsey is mostly black, with white stripes on the front and lower half of the back, and white numbers. The main clash guernsey is the reverse of this: mostly white, with black stripes and black numbers, worn in away matches against clubs with a predominantly dark guernsey such as [[Fremantle|Fremantle Football Club]] and [[Port Adelaide|Port Adelaide Football Club]]. A secondary clash guernsey was introduced in 2011 and is used only in matches against {{AFL Nor}} due to similarity between the two uniforms. The alternate uniform is black with only two white stripes on each side instead of three.\n\nTraditionally, Collingwood has worn a white guernsey with black stripes.

In Round 8 2002 Collingwood beat Brisbane by three points in a tense match in front of 46,279 people at [[Colonial Stadium]]. This victory over the reigning premier took the Magpies to equal top of the league table (2nd on percentage) with Brisbane. The rivalry grew with the 2002 Grand Final when Brisbane beat Collingwood by nine points. The rivalry grew again in 2003 when the two clubs clashed on four occasions. The Lions defeated the Magpies at [[The Gabba]] in Round 4 before thrashing them in Heritage Round \u2013 Round 19 at the MCG. Collingwood then defeated Brisbane in the Qualifying Final with [[Alan Didak]] ensuring victory late in the final quarter, with two goals from the boundary line.

This included the 1958 Grand Final where Collingwood's victory prevented Melbourne from equalling Collingwood's record of four premierships in succession (1927\u20131930). The old rivalry with [[Melbourne Football Club|Melbourne]] has faded in recent decades due to Melbourne not enjoying the same level of on-field success, however, it remains strong and is an annual scheduled fixture on the Queens Birthday public holiday.\n\n==== [[AFL team rivalries#Essendon v Collingwood|Essendon]] ====\n[[AFL team rivalries#Essendon v Collingwood|Collingwood's rivalry with Essendon]] has become more significant since 1995, when the first [[Anzac Day clash|ANZAC Day clash]] took place. After the 2019 match, Collingwood have won this contest 15 times and Essendon 9 times, with the first match being drawn.\n\n==== [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] ====\nThe rivalry with [[Port Adelaide FC|Port Adelaide]] stems from them being known as the Magpies in their local [[South Australian National Football League|SANFL]] competition before switching to the Power when entering the League in 1997. Feelings were heightened when Port midfielder [[Kane Cornes]] 'flipped the bird' at [[Nick Davis (footballer)|Nick Davis]] following the Power's five-point victory over the Magpies at [[AAMI Stadium]] in Round 9, 2002, only moments after [[Anthony Rocca]] had missed the opportunity to tie the scores. [[Jarrod Molloy]] and [[Brodie Holland]] remonstrated with Cornes after the match, with a feeling of hostility lingering after the two sides had left the field. Collingwood unexpectedly beat the Power in the Qualifying Final that season, also at AAMI stadium. Collingwood again defeated Port Adelaide in the 2003 Preliminary Final at the MCG. This added to the 'choking' phenomenon directed at the Power. The off-field battle over Port's desire to wear its black and white \"prison bar\" guernsey has been a major talking point, especially between 2002 and 2007, which added to the rivalry. A resolution was reached in favour of Collingwood.\n\n==== [[AFL team rivalries#Collingwood v Geelong|Geelong]] ====\n[[AFL team rivalries#Collingwood v Geelong|Games between Collingwood and Geelong]] have become highly anticipated since 2007. In Round 15 Geelong beat Collingwood by 16 points in a high-quality match. In the Preliminary final Collingwood surprised many when they came within 5 points of the eventual premiers. In 2008 Collingwood thrashed Geelong by 86 points\u201420.14 (134)- 7.6 (48) causing Geelong's only loss of the year. In 2009, the sides again met in the preliminary final, but despite high hopes the Cats, who would again win the premiership, won by 73 points in front of another massive crowd of 87,258.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lovett|2010|p=92}}</ref> In 2010, the two sides emerged as the favourites for the flag and twice met in front of blockbuster crowds at the MCG when they were placed 1st and 2nd on the ladder\u2014with the results evenly split. They again met in a Preliminary final, this time a resounding win to Collingwood by 41 points. In 2011, both teams were undefeated going into their round eight 'blockbuster' at the 'G. Geelong won by three points, after a controversial advantage was not paid to Magpie Scott Pendlebury in the dying minutes. Pendlebury kicked a goal and would have put the Pies in front, but the free kick was contentiously called back and Geelong managed to whisk the ball away. In the round 24 match, Geelong thumped the Magpies by a record margin of 96 points, which was also Collingwood's biggest ever loss at the MCG. The 2011 Grand Final against the Cats concluded with a 38-point loss for the Pies.\n\n===Supporters===\n[[File:Magpie mascot.jpg|thumb|200px|Collingwood Magpies mascot]]\nCollingwood is a working-class suburb and the Collingwood Football Club supporter base traditionally came from the working class (though its supporter base today goes far beyond). Many of the club's supporters who regularly attend games still come from the working class or from lower socio-economic groups, leading to jokes from supporters of other clubs which typically stereotype their Collingwood counterparts as poor, crude and ignorant.<ref>{{cite web|last=Humphrys|first=Elizabeth|title=Beyond a joke: Bogan loathing bring us all to shame|url=http://www.abc.net.au/unleashed/3571876.html|work=The Drum|publisher=ABC|accessdate=8 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003204636/http://www.abc.net.au/unleashed/3571876.html|archive-date=3 October 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nCollingwood is traditionally reviled by non-Collingwood supporters (\"You either love 'em or you hate 'em\"). The dislike of the club by outsiders is said to have originated during the 1920s and 1930s, a period of great success for the club which drew the envy and resentment of other clubs. In this period, Collingwood was also perceived as a Catholic and Irish club, at a time when these groups were looked down upon by the rest of Australian society and subjected to a considerable degree of social exclusion.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cordy|first=Neil|title=AFL AFL DEPARTMENT OF TRADE NAB CUP SHOWS VIDEO GWS Giants supporters are about to learn why footy fans love to hate Collingwood, writes Neil Cordy|url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/afl/afl-premiership/gws-giants-supporters-are-about-to-learn-why-footy-fans-love-to-hate-collingwood-writes-neil-cordy/story-e6frf3e3-1226436342075}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Sapienza|first=Joseph|title=Everybody hates Collingwood ... but why?|url=http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/everybody-hates-collingwood--but-why-20100921-15l4l.html|work=The Age|accessdate=8 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nUntil recent years, racial vilification of opposition players in VFL/AFL games was not uncommon.

Collingwood.\n\n===Off field===\nCollingwood was one of the last clubs to abandon its traditional stadium, the famous inner-city [[Victoria Park, Melbourne|Victoria Park]]. Collingwood now plays home games at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]]. It now also has its headquarters situated in the [[Melbourne Sports and Entertainment Center|former Glasshouse Entertainment Centre]]. Due to a sponsorship deal, this facility is known as 'The Holden Centre'.\n\nCollingwood continues to be financially viable through the loyal support of its huge following and numerous sponsors. After finishing 2nd in 2002 and 2003 the team fell to 13th and 15th (out of 16) in 2004 and 2005 respectively. This trend has plagued the club since the glory days of pre-World War II VFL football. Since 1958, the club has won only two VFL/AFL Premiership (the inaugural AFL Premiership in 1990, and in 2010). Despite this, the club still has won more individual games, more finals and made more grand final appearances than any other club.\n\nOn 9 March 2007, former Collingwood and Fitzroy defender [[Gary Pert]] was appointed the Magpies' CEO, seven weeks after Greg Swann departed for Carlton. In accepting the key Magpie post, Pert quit as a club director and as managing director of Channel 9 in Melbourne. In a press conference, it was stated that Collingwood has budgeted to turn over about $50&nbsp;million this year. McGuire hopes the new administration will soon double that figure. \"A finance administration review has come up with how we are going to turn Collingwood in to its next phase of its life\", McGuire said. \"What do we do to make ourselves go from a $45&nbsp;million a year turnover business to a $100&nbsp;million turnover business? \"They sound like big figures but in 1999 we turned over $13&nbsp;million, so that is where we are heading as a football club.\"\n\nThe club made an operating profit of $5.23 million for the 2013 season, revenue increased from $2.6 million to more than $75 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brw.com.au/p/marketing/collingwood_afl_club_builds_build_wIkGxHPlYSn6K0EX6MJTgK|title=Collingwood AFL&nbsp;club builds build TV studio for digital marketing expansion|date=8 January 2014|access-date=17 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923223834/http://www.brw.com.au/p/marketing/collingwood_afl_club_builds_build_wIkGxHPlYSn6K0EX6MJTgK|archive-date=23 September 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOn 24 July 2017, Pert resigned from his position as CEO of the club, with Peter Murphy replacing him as an interim CEO.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/collingwood-chief-executive-gary-pert-resigns-20170724-gxhbu4.html|title=Collingwood chief executive Gary Pert resigns|first=Jon|last=Pierik|newspaper=[[The Age]]|date=24 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Sponsorship===\nThe Collingwood guernsey is the most valuable sports sponsorship in Australia.<ref name=\"Magpies guernsey most valuable\">{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/business/afls-success-in-black-and-white-20110308-1bmk6.html |title=Magpies guernsey most valuable |work=The Age |location=Australia |date=9 March 2011 |accessdate=22 September 2011}}</ref> Collingwood has different guernsey sponsors for home and away matches, generating an estimated $6.3&nbsp;million worth of media exposure for the primary sponsor and $5.7&nbsp;million for the secondary sponsor.

Although meant to consist of four books, its writing was abandoned in the middle of the second book. It was probably composed shortly after Dante went into exile; internal evidence points to a date between 1302 and 1305.\n\nIn the first book, Dante discusses the relationship between Latin and [[vernacular]], and the search for an \"illustrious\" vernacular in the [[Italy|Italian]] area; the second book is an analysis of the structure of the ''canto'' or song (also spelled ''[[canzone|canzuni]]'' in [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]]), which is a [[literary genre]] developed in the Sicilian School of poetry.\n\nLatin essays were very popular in the [[Middle Ages]], but Dante made some innovations in his work: firstly, the subject (writing in vernacular) was an uncommon topic in literary discussion at that time. Also significant was how Dante approached this theme; that is, he presented an argument for giving vernacular the same dignity and legitimacy Latin was typically given. Finally, Dante wrote this essay in order to analyse the origin and the [[philosophy]] of the vernacular, because, in his opinion, this language was not something static, but something that evolves and needed a historical contextualisation.\n\n==Structure==\nDante interrupted his work at the fourteenth chapter of the second book, and though historians have tried to find a reason for this, it is still not known why Dante so abruptly aborted his essay. Indeed it is an unfinished project, and so information about its intended structure is limited. Though at some point, Dante mentions a fourth book in which he planned to deal with the [[comic genre]] and the \"mediocre\" style, nothing at all is known about the third book. It is thought, however, that the first book was meant to be a sort of preface to the following three books, and so shorter than the others.\n\n==Content==\nIn the beginning, Dante tackles the historical evolution of [[language]], which he thinks was born unitary and, at a later stage, was separated into different idioms because of the presumptuousness demonstrated by humankind at the time of the building of the [[Tower of Babel]]. He compiles a map of the geographical position of the languages he knows, dividing the European territory into three parts: one to the east, with the [[Greek language]]s; one to the north, with the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] languages, which he believed included Magyar and Slavic languages; one to the south, separated into three Romance languages identified by their word for 'yes': [[Occitan language|oc language]] (from {{lang|la|hoc}}), [[Langue d'o\u00efl|o\u00efl language]] (from {{lang|la|hoc illud}}) and [[Italian language|s\u00ec language]] (from {{lang|la|sic}}). He then discusses ''gramatica'', \"[[grammar]]\", which is a static language consisting of unchanging rules, needed to make up for the [[natural language]]s. In chapters ten to fifteen of the first book, Dante writes about his search for the [[illustrious vernacular]], among the fourteen varieties he claims to have found in the Italian region in Book 1 (X,VII): \"Perci\u00f2 \u00e8 evidente che l'Italia sola si diversifica in almeno quattordici volgari\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=De Vulgari Eloquentia|last=Alighieri|first=Dante|publisher=Felice Le Monnier|year=1948|isbn=|location=|pages=87}}</ref>  \n\nIn the second book, Dante deals with literary genres, specifying which are the ones that suit the vernacular.\n\n==Models==\nDante takes inspiration from rhetorical essays in Latin, [[Occitan language|Occitan]], [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]], and Italian, and from philosophical readings. The main classical rhetorical texts from which he drew information were the ''[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]'' by [[Horace]], the ''[[Rhetorica ad Herennium]]'' by an anonymous author, and ''[[De Inventione]]'' by [[Cicero]]. About the philosophical works, it is important to know that Dante read not only first hand texts, but also summaries  that sometimes were not of the original work, but of an intermediary one.  The influence and importance of the contribution of the Sicilian language is emphasized by his assertion that \"the first hundred and fifty years of Italian poetry was written in Sicilian\".<ref>\"Et primo de siciliano examinemus ingenium: nam videtur sicilianum vulgare sibi famam pre aliis asciscere eo quod quicquid poetantur Ytali sicilianum vocatur...\" (\"First let us turn our attention to the language of Sicily, since the Sicilian vernacular seems to hold itself in higher regard than any other, and because all the poetry written by the [[Italians]] is called \"Sicilian\"...\").
