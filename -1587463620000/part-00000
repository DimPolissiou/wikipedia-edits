He encounters Mary Lou Barebone, a non-magical woman (\"No-Maj\" or \"[[Muggle]]\") who heads the New Salem Philanthropic Society. As Newt listens to her speaking about witches and wizards being real and dangerous, a [[Magical creatures in Harry Potter#Creatures|Niffler]] escapes from Newt's magically expanded suitcase, which houses various magical creatures. As Newt attempts to capture the Niffler, he meets No-Maj cannery worker and aspiring baker Jacob Kowalski, and they unwittingly swap suitcases. Demoted [[Ministry of Magic|Auror]] (hunter of dark wizards) Tina Goldstein arrests Newt for the chaos caused by the Niffler and takes him to the Magical Congress of the United States of America (MACUSA) headquarters, hoping to regain her former position. However, as Jacob's suitcase contains only baked goods, Newt is released. At Jacob's tenement apartment, several creatures escape from Newt's suitcase.\n\nAfter Tina and Newt find Jacob and the suitcase, Tina takes them to her apartment and introduces them to Queenie, her [[Magic in Harry Potter#Legilimency and Occlumency|Legilimens]] sister. Jacob and Queenie are mutually attracted, though American wizards are forbidden to have any contact with No-Majs. Newt takes Jacob inside his magically expanded suitcase, where Jacob encounters a contained [[Magical creatures in Harry Potter#Obscurials/Obscurus|Obscurus]], a parasite that develops inside magically gifted children if they suppress their magical abilities. Newt extracted it from a young girl who died: Those afflicted rarely live past the age of ten. Newt persuades Jacob to help search for the missing creatures. After they re-capture two of the three escaped beasts, Tina returns the suitcase to MACUSA. Officials arrest them, believing one of Newt's beasts to be responsible for killing [[United States Senate|Senator]] Henry Shaw, Jr.. The Director of Magical Security, Percival Graves accuses Newt of conspiring with the infamous [[Magic in Harry Potter#Dark Arts|dark wizard]] [[List of supporting Harry Potter characters#Gellert Grindelwald|Gellert Grindelwald]], and decides to destroy Newt's suitcase and erase Jacob's recent memories of magic. Newt and Tina are sentenced to immediate death in secret, but they escape, aided by Queenie and Jacob, who also retrieve Newt's suitcase. Following a tip from Tina's old [[goblin]] informant Gnarlack, the foursome find and re-capture the last of the escaped creatures.\n\nMeanwhile, Graves approaches Mary Lou's adopted son Credence and offers to free him from his abusive mother. In exchange, Graves wants Credence to find an Obscurus that he believes has caused the mysterious destructive incidents around the city. Credence finds a [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Wand|wand]] under his adopted sister Modesty's bed. Mary Lou assumes it is Credence's wand, but Modesty says it is hers. When Modesty is about to be punished, the Obscurus kills Mary Lou and her eldest daughter Chastity. Graves arrives, and after Credence leads him to Modesty, who he assumes is the Obscurus's host, he dismisses Credence as being a [[Fictional universe of Harry Potter#Squibs|Squib]] and refuses to teach him magic as he had previously promised. Credence reveals he is the real host, having lived longer than any other host due to the intensity of his magic. In a fit of rage, Credence transforms and attacks the city.\n\nNewt finds Credence hiding in a subway tunnel, but he is attacked by Graves. Tina, who knows Credence (she lost her job trying to protect him from Mary Lou) arrives and attempts to calm him, while Graves tries to convince Credence to listen to him. As Credence begins to settle back into human form, Aurors arrive and apparently disintegrate him to protect the magical society. However, a tiny Obscurus fragment escapes. Graves admits his plan to unleash the Obscurus, expose the magical community to the No-Majs and frame Newt for it. He angrily claims that MACUSA protects the No-Majs more than themselves. As the president orders the Aurors to apprehend Graves, he attacks and begins to defeat all of them. Newt manages to subdue him with one of his beasts, and uses a revealing spell to expose Graves as Grindelwald in disguise; he is taken into custody.\n\nMACUSA fears their secret world has been exposed, but Newt releases his [[Thunderbird (mythology)|Thunderbird]] to disperse a potion as rainfall over the city, erasing all New Yorkers' recent memories while MACUSA wizards repair the destruction. Queenie kisses Jacob goodbye as the rain erases his memories.\n\nJacob and the rest of the No-Majs are obliviated with the help of the Thunderbird, and Newt returns to England. Jacob opens a bakery: Some of his products look like the beasts he met. Queenie enters, and Jacob smiles at her.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Fantastic Beasts & Where to Find Them Cast (Cropped).jpg|thumb|right|400px| ''Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them'' panel at the 2016 [[San Diego Comic Con International]] (left to right): director Yates; actors Redmayne, Waterston, Sudol, Fogler, Farrell, Miller.]]\n* [[Eddie Redmayne]] as [[Newt Scamander]],<ref name=\"RedmayneCast\" /> an introverted British wizard, magizoologist and an employee of the [[Ministry of Magic]].

He encounters Mary Lou Barebone, a non-magical woman (\"No-Maj\" or \"[[Muggle]]\") who heads the New Salem Philanthropic Society. As Newt listens to her speaking about witches and wizards being real and dangerous, a [[Magical creatures in Harry Potter#Creatures|Niffler]] escapes from Newt's magically expanded suitcase, which houses various magical creatures. As Newt attempts to capture the Niffler, he meets No-Maj cannery worker and aspiring baker Jacob Kowalski, and they unwittingly swap suitcases. Demoted [[Ministry of Magic|Auror]] (hunter of dark wizards) Tina Goldstein arrests Newt for the chaos caused by the Niffler and takes him to the Magical Congress of the United States of America (MACUSA) headquarters, hoping to regain her former position. However, as Jacob's suitcase contains only baked goods, Newt is released. At Jacob's tenement apartment, several creatures escape from Newt's suitcase.\n\nAfter Tina and Newt find Jacob and the suitcase, Tina takes them to her apartment and introduces them to Queenie, her [[Magic in Harry Potter#Legilimency and Occlumency|Legilimens]] sister. Jacob and Queenie are mutually attracted, though American wizards are forbidden to have any contact with No-Majs. Newt takes Jacob inside his magically expanded suitcase, where Jacob encounters a contained [[Magical creatures in Harry Potter#Obscurials/Obscurus|Obscurus]], a parasite that develops inside magically gifted children if they suppress their magical abilities. Newt extracted it from a young girl who died: Those afflicted rarely live past the age of ten. Newt persuades Jacob to help search for the missing creatures. After they re-capture two of the three escaped beasts, Tina returns the suitcase to MACUSA. Officials arrest them, believing one of Newt's beasts to be responsible for killing [[United States Senate|Senator]] Henry Shaw, Jr.. The Director of Magical Security, Percival Graves accuses Newt of conspiring with the infamous [[Magic in Harry Potter#Dark Arts|dark wizard]] [[List of supporting Harry Potter characters#Gellert Grindelwald|Gellert Grindelwald]], and decides to destroy Newt's suitcase and erase Jacob's recent memories of magic. Newt and Tina are sentenced to immediate death in secret, but they escape, aided by Queenie and Jacob, who also retrieve Newt's suitcase. Following a tip from Tina's old [[goblin]] informant Gnarlack, the foursome find and re-capture the last of the escaped creatures.\n\nMeanwhile, Graves approaches Mary Lou's adopted son Credence and offers to free him from his abusive mother. In exchange, Graves wants Credence to find an Obscurus that he believes has caused the mysterious destructive incidents around the city. Credence finds a [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Wand|wand]] under his adopted sister Modesty's bed. Mary Lou assumes it is Credence's wand, but Modesty says it is hers. When Modesty is about to be punished, the Obscurus kills Mary Lou and her eldest daughter Chastity. Graves arrives, and after Credence leads him to Modesty, who he assumes is the Obscurus's host, he dismisses Credence as being a [[Fictional universe of Harry Potter#Squibs|Squib]] and refuses to teach him magic as he had previously promised. Credence reveals he is the real host, having lived longer than any other host due to the intensity of his magic. In a fit of rage, Credence transforms and attacks the city.\n\nNewt finds Credence hiding in a subway tunnel, but he is attacked by Graves. Tina, who knows Credence (she lost her job trying to protect him from Mary Lou) arrives and attempts to calm him, while Graves tries to convince Credence to listen to him. As Credence begins to settle back into human form, Aurors arrive and apparently disintegrate him to protect the magical society. However, a tiny Obscurus fragment escapes. Graves admits his plan to unleash the Obscurus, expose the magical community to the No-Majs and frame Newt for it. He angrily claims that MACUSA protects the No-Majs more than themselves. As the president orders the Aurors to apprehend Graves, he attacks and begins to defeat all of them. Newt manages to subdue him with one of his beasts, and uses a revealing spell to expose Graves as Grindelwald in disguise; he is taken into custody.\n\nMACUSA fears their secret world has been exposed, but Newt releases his [[Thunderbird (mythology)|Thunderbird]] to disperse a potion as rainfall over the city, erasing all New Yorkers' recent memories while MACUSA wizards repair the destruction. Queenie kisses Jacob goodbye as the rain erases his memories.\n\nJacob and the rest of the No-Majs are obliviated with the help of the Thunderbird, and Newt returns to England. Jacob opens a bakery: Some of his products look like the beasts he met. Queenie enters, and Jacob smiles at her.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Fantastic Beasts & Where to Find Them Cast (Cropped).jpg|thumb|right|400px| ''Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them'' panel at the 2016 [[San Diego Comic Con International]] (left to right): director Yates; actors Redmayne, Waterston, Sudol, Fogler, Farrell, Miller.]]\n* [[Eddie Redmayne]] as [[Newt Scamander]],<ref name=\"RedmayneCast\" /> an introverted British wizard, magizoologist and an employee of the [[Ministry of Magic]].

Folsom, John H. Minan, Lee Ann Otto, ''Law and Politics in the People's Republic of China'', [[West (publisher)|West Publishing]] (St. Paul, 1992), pp.&nbsp;76\u201377.</ref> According to a prominent government spokesman:<blockquote>We will never simply copy the system of Western countries or introduce a system of multiple parties holding office in rotation; although China\u2019s state organs have different responsibilities, they all adhere to the line, principles and policies of the party.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7932091.stm \"China 'will not have democracy'] China will never adopt Western-style democracy with a multi-party system, its top legislator has said.\" BBC 9 March 2009, accessed October 9, 2010.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe primary organs of state power are the [[National People's Congress]], the [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]], and the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]]. Members of the State Council include the [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier]], a variable number of [[Vice Premier of the People's Republic of China|Vice Premiers]], five [[State councillor (China)|State Councilors]] (protocol equal of vice premiers but with narrower portfolios), the [[Secretary-General of the State Council|Secretary-General]], and now 26 [[Ministries of the People's Republic of China|ministers and other cabinet-level department heads]].  During the 1980s there was an attempt made to separate party and state functions, with the party deciding general policy and the state carrying it out. The attempt was abandoned in the 1990s with the result that the political leadership within the state are also the leaders of the party. This dual structure thereby creates a single centralized focus of power.\n\nAt the same time there has been a move to separate party and state offices at levels other than the central government. It is not unheard of for a sub-national executive to also be party secretary.  This frequently causes conflict between the chief executive and the party secretary, and this conflict is widely seen as intentional to prevent either from becoming too powerful.  Some special cases are the [[special administrative regions of China|Special Administrative Regions]] of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], where according to constitution and respective basic law, most national laws do not apply and the [[autonomous regions of China|autonomous regions]] where, following Soviet practice, the chief executive is typically a member of the local ethnic group while the party general secretary is non-local and usually [[Han Chinese]].\n\nUnder the [[Constitution of China]], the NPC is the highest organ of state power in China. It meets annually for about two weeks to review and approve major new policy directions, laws, the budget, and major personnel changes. Most national legislation in the PRC is adopted by the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]]. Most initiatives are presented to the NPCSC for consideration by the State Council after previous endorsement by the Communist Party's Politburo Standing Committee. Although the NPC generally approves State Council policy and personnel recommendations, the NPC and its standing committee has increasingly asserted its role as the national legislature and has been able to force revisions in some laws. For example, the State Council and the Party have been unable to secure passage of a fuel tax to finance the construction of [[Expressways of China|expressways]].<ref>[http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/Issues/2009/January/ChinaBitesTheBulletOnFuelTax.asp China bites the bullet on fuel tax].

Historically it has five to nine members, and currently has seven members. Its officially mandated purpose is to conduct policy discussions and make decisions on major issues when the Politburo, a larger decision-making body, is not in session. According to the party's [[Constitution of the Communist Party of China|Constitution]], the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary of the Central Committee]] must also be a member of the Politburo Standing Committee.<ref>[http://www.china.org.cn/english/features/49109.htm#4 Chapter III Central Organizations of the Party - Article 22]</ref>\n\nThe membership of the PSC is strictly ranked in [[Orders of precedence in the People's Republic of China|protocol sequence]]. Historically, the general secretary (or party chairman) has been ranked first; the rankings of other leaders have varied over time. Since the 1990s, the general secretary, premier, chairman of the [[National People's Congress]], the chairman of the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]], the secretary of the [[Central Commission for Discipline Inspection]], the party's top anti-graft body, and the first-ranked secretary of the [[Secretariat of the Communist Party of China|secretariat]] have consistently also been members of the Politburo Standing Committee.<ref name=\"CF111312\">{{cite news |title = China's Next Leaders: A Guide to What's at Stake |url = http://www.chinafile.com/china%E2%80%99s-next-leaders-guide-what%E2%80%99s-stake |access-date = 18 November 2012 |newspaper = China File |date = 13 November 2012 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130210034750/http://www.chinafile.com/china%E2%80%99s-next-leaders-guide-what%E2%80%99s-stake |archive-date = 2013-02-10 |url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n== Paramount leader ==\n[[File:Xi Jinping March 2017.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Paramount leader]] and [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]] ]]\n{{Main article|Paramount leader}}\n\nPower is concentrated in the [[Paramount leader]], currently [[Xi Jinping]], who heads the four most important political and state offices: He is [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]] of the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]], general secretary of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Central Committee]], [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission]], and [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]] of the PRC.<ref>{{cite web |url =https://multimedia.scmp.com/widgets/china/cpc-primer/ |title = A simple guide to the Chinese government|publisher=[[South China Morning Post]] |quote = [[Xi Jinping]] is the most powerful figure in the Chinese political system.

Before that an interim constitution-like document created by the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]] was in force. The second promulgation in 1975 shortened the Constitution to just about 30 articles, and contained Communist slogans and revolutionary language throughout. The role of courts was slashed, and the Presidency was gone. The 3rd promulgation in 1978 expanded the number of articles, but was still under  the influence of the just-gone-by Cultural Revolution.\n\nThe current constitution is the PRC's fourth promulgation. On December 4, 1982, it was promulgated and has served as a stable constitution for 30 years. The roles of the presidency and the courts were normalized, and under the constitution, all citizens were equal. Amendments in 1988, 1993, 1999, 2004, and 2018 recognized private property, safeguarded human rights, and further promoted the non-public sector of the economy.\n\n==National People's Congress==\n{{Main|National People's Congress}}\n[[image:The 1st Session of the 12th National People's Congress open 20130305.jpg|thumb|right|270px|The 12th [[National People's Congress]] held in 2013]]\n\nThe [[National People's Congress]] (usually abbreviated NPC) is the national legislature of the People's Republic of China.

The NPC and the National Committee of the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference|People's Political Consultative Conference]] (CPPCC), a consultative body whose members represent various social groups, are the main deliberative bodies of China, and are often referred to as the [[Lianghui]] (Two Assemblies).<ref>{{cite web |title = State Structure of the People's Republic of China |url = http://www.npc.gov.cn/englishnpc/stateStructure/node_3826.htm |website = \u4e2d\u56fd\u4eba\u5927\u7f51 |publisher=The National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China |access-date = 2016-09-29 }}</ref>\n\nThe NPC is elected for a term of five years.

permanent legislative organ which makes most laws, interprets the constitution and laws, conducts [[constitutional review]], and supervise all following organs;\n# [[President of the People's Republic

[[Vice President of the People's Republic of China|Vice-President]], who has no power itself, but assist the President.\n# [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] (synonymous with \"Central People's Government\"): the executive branch, whose [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier]] is the [[head of government]];\n# [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central

[[Constitution of China|the PRC Constitution]] and its position as the supreme political authority in the PRC is realised through its comprehensive control of the state, military, and media.<ref>Ralph H. Folsom, John H. Minan, Lee Ann Otto, ''Law and Politics in the People's Republic of China'', [[West (publisher)|West Publishing]] (St. Paul, 1992), pp.&nbsp;76\u201377.</ref> According to a prominent government spokesman:<blockquote>We will never simply copy the system of Western countries or introduce a system of multiple parties holding office in rotation; although China\u2019s state organs have different responsibilities, they all adhere to the line, principles and policies of the party.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7932091.stm \"China 'will not have democracy'] China will never adopt Western-style democracy with a multi-party system, its top legislator has said.\" BBC 9 March 2009, accessed October 9, 2010.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe primary organs of state power are the [[National People's Congress]], the [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]], and the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]]. Members of the State Council include the [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier]], a variable number of [[Vice Premier of the People's Republic of China|Vice Premiers]], five [[State councillor (China)|State Councilors]] (protocol equal of vice premiers but with narrower portfolios), the [[Secretary-General of the State Council|Secretary-General]], and now 26 [[Ministries of the People's Republic of China|ministers and other cabinet-level department heads]].  During the 1980s there was an attempt made to separate party and state functions, with the party deciding general policy and the state carrying it out. The attempt was abandoned in the 1990s with the result that the political leadership within the state are also the leaders of the party. This dual structure thereby creates a single centralized focus of power.\n\nAt the same time there has been a move to separate party and state offices at levels other than the central government. It is not unheard of for a sub-national executive to also be party secretary.  This frequently causes conflict between the chief executive and the party secretary, and this conflict is widely seen as intentional to prevent either from becoming too powerful.  Some special cases are the [[special administrative regions of China|Special Administrative Regions]] of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], where according to constitution and respective basic law, most national laws do not apply and the [[autonomous regions of China|autonomous regions]] where, following Soviet practice, the chief executive is typically a member of the local ethnic group while the party general secretary is non-local and usually [[Han Chinese]].\n\nUnder the [[Constitution of China]], the NPC is the highest organ of state power in China. It meets annually for about two weeks to review and approve major new policy directions, laws, the budget, and major personnel changes. Most national legislation in the PRC is adopted by the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]]. Most initiatives are presented to the NPCSC for consideration by the State Council after previous endorsement by the Communist Party's Politburo Standing Committee. Although the NPC generally approves State Council policy and personnel recommendations, the NPC and its standing committee has increasingly asserted its role as the national legislature and has been able to force revisions in some laws. For example, the State Council and the Party have been unable to secure passage of a fuel tax to finance the construction of [[Expressways of China|expressways]].<ref>[http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/Issues/2009/January/ChinaBitesTheBulletOnFuelTax.asp China bites the bullet on fuel tax].

Historically it has five to nine members, and currently has seven members. Its officially mandated purpose is to conduct policy discussions and make decisions on major issues when the Politburo, a larger decision-making body, is not in session. According to the party's [[Constitution of the Communist Party of China|Constitution]], the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary of the Central Committee]] must also be a member of the Politburo Standing Committee.<ref>[http://www.china.org.cn/english/features/49109.htm#4 Chapter III Central Organizations of the Party - Article 22]</ref>\n\nThe membership of the PSC is strictly ranked in [[Orders of precedence in the People's Republic of China|protocol sequence]]. Historically, the general secretary (or party chairman) has been ranked first; the rankings of other leaders have varied over time. Since the 1990s, the general secretary, premier, chairman of the [[National People's Congress]], the chairman of the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]], the secretary of the [[Central Commission for Discipline Inspection]], the party's top anti-graft body, and the first-ranked secretary of the [[Secretariat of the Communist Party of China|secretariat]] have consistently also been members of the Politburo Standing Committee.<ref name=\"CF111312\">{{cite news |title = China's Next Leaders: A Guide to What's at Stake |url = http://www.chinafile.com/china%E2%80%99s-next-leaders-guide-what%E2%80%99s-stake |access-date = 18 November 2012 |newspaper = China File |date = 13 November 2012 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130210034750/http://www.chinafile.com/china%E2%80%99s-next-leaders-guide-what%E2%80%99s-stake |archive-date = 2013-02-10 |url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n== Paramount leader ==\n[[File:Xi Jinping March 2017.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Paramount leader]] and [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]] ]]\n{{Main article|Paramount leader}}\n\nPower is concentrated in the [[Paramount leader]], currently [[Xi Jinping]], who heads the four most important political and state offices: He is [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]] of the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]], general secretary of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Central Committee]], [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission]], and [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]] of the PRC.<ref>{{cite web |url =https://multimedia.scmp.com/widgets/china/cpc-primer/ |title = A simple guide to the Chinese government|publisher=[[South China Morning Post]] |quote = [[Xi Jinping]] is the most powerful figure in the Chinese political system.

Before that an interim constitution-like document created by the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]] was in force. The second promulgation in 1975 shortened the Constitution to just about 30 articles, and contained Communist slogans and revolutionary language throughout. The role of courts was slashed, and the Presidency was gone. The 3rd promulgation in 1978 expanded the number of articles, but was still under  the influence of the just-gone-by Cultural Revolution.\n\nThe current constitution is the PRC's fourth promulgation. On December 4, 1982, it was promulgated and has served as a stable constitution for 30 years. The roles of the presidency and the courts were normalized, and under the constitution, all citizens were equal. Amendments in 1988, 1993, 1999, 2004, and 2018 recognized private property, safeguarded human rights, and further promoted the non-public sector of the economy.\n\n==National People's Congress==\n{{Main|National People's Congress}}\n[[image:The 1st Session of the 12th National People's Congress open 20130305.jpg|thumb|right|270px|The 12th [[National People's Congress]] held in 2013]]\n\nThe [[National People's Congress]] (usually abbreviated NPC) is the national legislature of the People's Republic of China.

There are about 50 members in the council. In the politics of the People's Republic of China, the [[Central People's Government]] forms one of three interlocking branches of power, the others being the Communist Party of China and the People's Liberation Army. The State Council directly oversees the various subordinate People's Governments in the provinces, and in practice maintains an interlocking membership with the top levels of the Communist Party of China.\n\nCurrently the [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier of the State Council]] is [[Li Keqiang]] and the [[Vice Premier of the People's Republic of China|Vice Premiers]] are [[Han Zheng]], [[Sun Chunlan]], [[Hu Chunhua]] and [[Liu He (politician)|Liu He]].

The [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] special administrative regions (SARS) have some local autonomy since they have separate governments, legal systems, and basic constitutional laws, but they come under Beijing's control in matters of [[foreign policy]] and [[national security]], and their chief executives are handpicked by the central government. Below the provincial level in 2004 there were 50 rural prefectures, 283 prefecture-level cities, 374 county-level cities, 852 county-level districts under the jurisdiction of nearby cities, and 1,636 counties. There also were 662 cities (including those incorporated into the four centrally controlled municipalities), 808 urban districts, and 43,258 township-level regions. \n\nCounties are divided into townships and villages.
