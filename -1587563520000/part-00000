Faizan is 'the good son' and wants to live up to his father's dream which is to run a business and improve the lifestyle of their family. Unfortunately the dreams are shattered while he was taking his exams as he is implicated  in a crime- a dispute with the 'booti mafia' (people facilitating cheating during exams), this results in his father's death and mother's mental health suffers due to shock of the tragic events, one following the other in quick succession.\n\nIn jail, he meets a man called Zaigham (Saud) and becomes friends with him who knows his enemies well and has his own issues to settle with them. Zaigham gets Faizan out of jail. Faizan now wants revenge for his parents. The rest is as predictable as any action movie made anywhere in the world - a journey towards retribution, passing through the maze called politics and crime.\n\n[[Zara Sheikh]], the girl  Faizan loves, gets married to (Sami Khan) a police officer who is looking for Faizan since he is a criminal and Zara hides his picture when she sees it in Sami's wanted list so he won't know what he looks like. Meera and Faizan team up to kill Sajid Hassan who is the gang leader. Meera wants to kill him because he killed her sister by throwing acid on her face.

She played both roles of [[The Twins (The Parent Trap)|twin sisters]] who were raised separately by divorced parents, without any knowledge of each other. They meet at a summer holiday camp, and switch places so that they can each meet their other parent. Mills reprised her roles three times in subsequent [[Television film|made-for-television]] sequels. \n\nA [[The Parent Trap (1998 film)|remake]] was released in 1998, with a plot similar to the original film and written by the original film's writer/director [[David Swift (director)|David Swift]], with segments of the story being reworked into a [[Romance film|romantic]]-[[Comedy film|comedy]].

It was based on the book ''[[Lottie and Lisa|Das Doppelte Lottchen]]'' written by [[Erich K\u00e4stner]]. The film stars Hayley Mills who plays the roles of the thirteen-year-old twin girls, Sharon and Susan. [[Maureen O'Hara]] and [[Brian Keith]] play the twins\u2019 parents, Maggie and Mitch. The film is about the two girls who meet at a summer camp as strangers and realize that they are identical twins. They switch places so that each can meet the other parent, and they plan to bring their divorced parents back together. Soon after switching, the twins learn that there is a new woman, named Vicky Robinson (played by [[Joanna Barnes]]), in their father's life. After Mitch tells Sharon about his engagement to Vicky, the girls come up with a new game plan to get rid of the woman who threatens their plan to reconnect their parents.<ref>''The Parent Trap.''

It was directed by [[Ronald F. Maxwell]]. The film is a continuation of the Walt Disney film ''The Parent Trap''. ''The Parent Trap II'' was filmed twenty-five years after the original film. The idea of a second film was announced in 1985. The only actor who returned from the original film, Hayley Mills, continues to portray the twins, Sharon and Susan. ''The Parent Trap II'' focuses on Sharon's daughter Nikki who tries to set up her mother with her best friend's father, portrayed by [[Tom Skerritt]]. All the music was composed by [[Charles Fox (composer)|Charles Fox]] as well as the title song \"Lets Keep What We Got\" was performed by [[Marilyn McCoo]].\n\n===''Parent Trap III''===\n\n{{Main|Parent Trap III}}\n''The Parent Trap II'' was such a success for the Disney Channel that it spawned another made-for-television sequel, ''Parent Trap III'', in 1989.

The remake caught the attention of audiences when it premiered on July 29, 1998. The parents of the twins, Nick Parker (played by [[Dennis Quaid]]) and Elizabeth James (played by [[Natasha Richardson]]), marry on a cruise ship and quickly figure out their lives are in two separate places.

It comes from the 1540s Latin \"ridiculosus\" meaning  \"laughable\", from \"ridiculus\" meaning  \"that which excites laughter\", and from \"ridere\" meaning \"to laugh\".<ref name=DC>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ridiculous Dictionary.com]</ref> \"Ridiculous\" is an adjective describing \"the ridiculous\".\n\nIn common usage, \"ridiculousness\" is used as a synonym for [[absurdity]] or [[nonsense]].<ref>[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/nonsensical Free Dictionary]</ref><ref>[http://thesaurus.com/browse/illogicality Thesaurus.com]</ref> From a historical and technical viewpoint, \"absurdity\" is associated with argumentation and reasoning, \"nonsense\" with [[semantics]] and [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]], while \"ridiculous\" is most associated with laughter, superiority, deformity, and incongruity. ''[[Reductio ad absurdum]]'' is a valid method of [[argument]], while ''[[appeal to ridicule|reductio ad ridiculum]]'' is invalid. Argument by [[invective]] declaration of ridiculous is invalid, while arguments involving declarations of nonsense may summarize a [[logical reasoning|cogent]] semantic problem with lack or meaning or [[ambiguity]].\n\nHistorically, the ridiculous was central to initial theories of humor and laughter as first put forth by philosopher [[Thomas Hobbes]]. It is currently used in the [[theories of humor|theory of humor]] to create laughter, shock, parody, or satire. Reactions to the ridiculous have been studied in [[psychology]] for its effects on memory, attention, and attitude in social hierarchies. These studies have been applied to the theory of advertisement regarding attention, memory, and alleviation of preexisting negative attitudes toward products. The ridiculous is often contrasted with the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]], one of extreme inferiority, the other of extreme superiority, and often one can suddenly move from one extreme state to the other.\n\n== Humor ==\n{{Further information|Theory of humor}}\n\n=== History: Incongruity, the superiority theory of humor, and deformity ===\nThe ridiculous often has extreme incongruity (things that are not thought to belong next to each other) or inferiority, e.g., \"when something that was dignified is reduced to a\nridiculous position (here noting the element of the incongruous), so that laughter\nis most intense when we escape from a 'coerced solemnity'.\"<ref>''Humour, Jokes and the Statement'', Journal of Human Values, 2006, S Acharya, [http://jhv.sagepub.com/content/12/2/179.short]</ref><ref>[http://bjaesthetics.oxfordjournals.org/content/4/3/284 British Journal of Aesthetics, (1964) 4 (3), Harold Osborne, p.284]</ref> For [[Aristotle]], we laugh at inferior or [[unattractiveness|ugly]] individuals, because we feel a joy at being superior to them.<ref>''Poetics'', 1449a, p. 34-35.</ref> [[Socrates]] was reported by [[Plato]] as saying that the ridiculous was characterized by a display of self-ignorance.<ref>Plato, ''Philebus'' 49b ff.</ref> [[Deformity]] was considered by some to be essential to the ridiculous.<ref>Laughter as a Test of Truth in Enlightenment Satire'', Werner von Koppenfels</ref><ref name=HEL>A history of English Laughter: Laughter from Beowulf to Beckett and Beyond, Manfred Pfister</ref> Psychological theories of humor  include the \"incongruity theory\" and the \"superiority theory\", the latter of which the philosopher Thomas Hobbes was an early proponent.<ref>The Perception of Humor, Willibald Ruch, Emotions, qualia, and consciousness, Biocybernetics, VOl. 10</ref><ref>How Many Feminists Does It Take To Make A Joke?

For example, if food were scarce, a Hey\u00f3k\u021fa would sit around and complain about how full he was; during a baking hot heat wave a Hey\u00f3k\u021fa would shiver with cold and put on gloves and cover himself with a thick blanket.

It comes from the 1540s Latin \"ridiculosus\" meaning  \"laughable\", from \"ridiculus\" meaning  \"that which excites laughter\", and from \"ridere\" meaning \"to laugh\".<ref name=DC>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ridiculous Dictionary.com]</ref> \"Ridiculous\" is an adjective describing \"the ridiculous\".\n\nIn common usage, \"ridiculousness\" is used as a synonym for [[absurdity]] or [[nonsense]].<ref>[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/nonsensical Free Dictionary]</ref><ref>[http://thesaurus.com/browse/illogicality Thesaurus.com]</ref> From a historical and technical viewpoint, \"absurdity\" is associated with argumentation and reasoning, \"nonsense\" with [[semantics]] and [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]], while \"ridiculous\" is most associated with laughter, superiority, deformity, and incongruity. ''[[Reductio ad absurdum]]'' is a valid method of [[argument]], while ''[[appeal to ridicule|reductio ad ridiculum]]'' is invalid. Argument by [[invective]] declaration of ridiculous is invalid, while arguments involving declarations of nonsense may summarize a [[logical reasoning|cogent]] semantic problem with lack or meaning or [[ambiguity]].\n\nHistorically, the ridiculous was central to initial theories of humor and laughter as first put forth by philosopher [[Thomas Hobbes]]. It is currently used in the [[theories of humor|theory of humor]] to create laughter, shock, parody, or satire. Reactions to the ridiculous have been studied in [[psychology]] for its effects on memory, attention, and attitude in social hierarchies. These studies have been applied to the theory of advertisement regarding attention, memory, and alleviation of preexisting negative attitudes toward products. The ridiculous is often contrasted with the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]], one of extreme inferiority, the other of extreme superiority, and often one can suddenly move from one extreme state to the other.\n\n== Humor ==\n{{Further information|Theory of humor}}\n\n=== History: Incongruity, the superiority theory of humor, and deformity ===\nThe ridiculous often has extreme incongruity (things that are not thought to belong next to each other) or inferiority, e.g., \"when something that was dignified is reduced to a\nridiculous position (here noting the element of the incongruous), so that laughter\nis most intense when we escape from a 'coerced solemnity'.\"<ref>''Humour, Jokes and the Statement'', Journal of Human Values, 2006, S Acharya, [http://jhv.sagepub.com/content/12/2/179.short]</ref><ref>[http://bjaesthetics.oxfordjournals.org/content/4/3/284 British Journal of Aesthetics, (1964) 4 (3), Harold Osborne, p.284]</ref> For [[Aristotle]], we laugh at inferior or [[unattractiveness|ugly]] individuals, because we feel a joy at being superior to them.<ref>''Poetics'', 1449a, p. 34-35.</ref> [[Socrates]] was reported by [[Plato]] as saying that the ridiculous was characterized by a display of self-ignorance.<ref>Plato, ''Philebus'' 49b ff.</ref> [[Deformity]] was considered by some to be essential to the ridiculous.<ref>Laughter as a Test of Truth in Enlightenment Satire'', Werner von Koppenfels</ref><ref name=HEL>A history of English Laughter: Laughter from Beowulf to Beckett and Beyond, Manfred Pfister</ref> Psychological theories of humor  include the \"incongruity theory\" and the \"superiority theory\", the latter of which the philosopher Thomas Hobbes was an early proponent.<ref>The Perception of Humor, Willibald Ruch, Emotions, qualia, and consciousness, Biocybernetics, VOl. 10</ref><ref>How Many Feminists Does It Take To Make A Joke?
