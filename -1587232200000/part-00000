While the changes in Brazil happened slowly, they were drastic. Some young people were taken to the United States and allegedly required to work at the church or companies owned by members.

NHPR is based in [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]] and operates eight transmitters and six translators covering nearly the whole state, as well as portions of [[Massachusetts]], [[Vermont]] and [[Maine]]. The network airs NPR news and talk shows on weekdays and a mix of cultural and music programs on weekends.\n\nNHPR's news staff of 21 is one of the largest in the state and is the only statewide source of radio news.\n\n==History and listenership==\nNHPR's original station, [[WEVO]], signed on from Concord on August 4, 1981. It was originally known as \"'''Granite State Public Radio''',\" after New Hampshire's [[List of U.S. state nicknames|state nickname]]. Prior to its sign-on, New Hampshire was one of the few states in New England without a clear signal from an NPR station. \n\nWEVO had 500 members at its start. Over several years the station grew in size. In 1991, the newly renamed NHPR began broadcasting 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Between 1992 and 2011, six other stations joined the network. In 1995 NHPR launched ''The Exchange'', hosted by former NPR reporter Laura Knoy.\n\nUntil 2000, NHPR broadcast a mix of NPR news and [[classical music]]. However, in 2000 it switched its weekday schedule to all news and talk.\n\nIn spring 2007 NHPR had a weekly audience of 161,100 listeners and about 16,000 contributing members. It had an annual budget of $4.5 million, with contributions from listeners, local businesses, grants and funding from the [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]]. Contributions from listeners and businesses in New Hampshire make up more than 90 percent of NHPR's revenue. NHPR does not receive funding from the state of New Hampshire.\n\nIn 2014, NHPR bought [[WCNH]], a classical music station. Since WCNH operates at only 190 watts, it is simulcast on WEVO's second HD channel.\n\n==Stations==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Location\n!Frequency\n![[Call sign]]\n!First air date\n|-\n| [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]] <br>([[Manchester, New Hampshire|Manchester]])<br><small>(flagship)</small>\n| '''89.1 FM'''\n| '''[[WEVO]]'''\n| August 4, 1981<ref name=by2003>{{cite book|title=Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 2003-04|year=2003|pages=D\u2013300\u20132|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC-YB/2003-04/D-Radio-NE-TER-BC-YB-2003-04.pdf|accessdate=October 9, 2011}}</ref> \n|- \n| [[Hanover, New Hampshire|Hanover]] <br> ([[Lebanon, New Hampshire|Lebanon]])\n| '''91.3 FM'''\n| '''[[WEVH]]'''\n| October 1992<ref name=by2003/>\n|- \n| [[Keene, New Hampshire|Keene]]\n| '''90.7 FM'''\n| '''[[WEVN]]'''\n| April 1993<ref name=by2003/>\n|- \n| [[Gorham, New Hampshire|Gorham]]\n| '''107.1 FM'''\n| '''[[WEVC]]'''\n| May 2000<sup>1</sup> <ref name=by2003/>\n|- \n| [[Jackson, New Hampshire|Jackson]]\n| '''99.5 FM'''\n| '''[[WEVJ]]'''\n| August 14, 2002<ref name=by2003/><ref name=nerw-wevjstart>{{cite news|last=Fybush|first=Scott|title=WLAN Makes Sports Flip, WBBF becomes WROC|url=http://www.bostonradio.org/nerw/nerw-020819.html|accessdate=October 9, 2011|newspaper=North East RadioWatch|date=August 19, 2002}}</ref> \n|- \n| [[Nashua, New Hampshire|Nashua]]\n| '''88.3 FM'''\n| '''[[WEVS]]'''\n| August 9, 2005<ref name=nerw-wevsstart>{{cite news|last=Fybush|first=Scott|title=NorthEast Radio Watch|url=http://www.fybush.com/NERW/2005/050808/nerw.html|accessdate=October 9, 2011|date=August 15, 2005}}</ref> \n|- \n| [[Colebrook, New Hampshire|Colebrook]]\n| '''90.3 FM'''\n| '''[[WEVF]]'''\n| April 26, 2011<ref name=nhpr-wevfstart>{{cite news|last=McPherson|first=Scott|title=Our Newest Station, WEVF in Colebrook|url=http://www.nhpr.org/our-newest-station-wevf-colebrook|accessdate=October 9, 2011|newspaper=NHPR.org|date=April 26, 2011}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name=nerw-wevfstart>{{cite news|last=Fybush|first=Scott|title=Rambaldo Lands Erie FM CP|url=http://www.fybush.com/NERW/2011/110509/nerw.html|accessdate=October 9, 2011|newspaper=NorthEast Radio Watch|date=May 9, 2011}}</ref> \n|- \n| [[Littleton, New Hampshire|Littleton]]\n| '''91.9 FM'''\n| '''WEVQ'''\n|October 18, 2011<ref>[http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/app_det.pl?Application_id=1448059 Application Search Details] fcc.gov.

As has been the case with most other NPR member stations over the past decade and a half, the network dropped music programming (except for a handful of weekend features) by 2001 to carry news and information programming around the clock.\n\nLocal staff produces three hours each day of newscasts and feature reports on local New Hampshire news and two daily interview programs. ''The Exchange'', hosted by Laura Knoy, is a one-hour morning news and public affairs call-in show. ''Word of Mouth'', hosted by Justine Paradis, is a one-hour midday general topics interview show. NHPR also locally produces ''The Folk Show'', a live show featuring performances by local musicians, on Sunday evenings and hosted by Kate McNally.\n\nNHPR broadcasts the major daily news programs produced by NPR, including ''[[Morning Edition]]'' and ''[[All Things Considered]]''. The statewide network also broadcasts programming from [[American Public Media]], including ''[[Live from Here]]'' and ''[[Marketplace (radio program)|Marketplace]]'', as well as programs from [[Public Radio International]], including ''[[Studio 360]]'', ''[[The Takeaway]]'', ''[[This American Life]]''. NHPR also airs programming from international broadcasters, such as ''[[As It Happens]]'', the [[BBC World Service]] from Britain.\n\n==Writers on a New England Stage==\nNHPR, in conjunction with the [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire|Portsmouth]] [[The Music Hall (Portsmouth)|Music Hall]], has produced a series on New England writers and authors. So far the series has had such authors as [[John Updike]] (''[[Terrorist (novel)|Terrorist]]''), [[Doris Kearns Goodwin]], [[Dan Brown]] (''[[The Da Vinci Code]]''), [[Alan Alda]], and [[Mitch Albom]]. Virginia Prescott of ''Word of Mouth'' is the interviewer, and the trio [[Dreadnaught USA|Dreadnaught]] is the house band. The ''River Run Bookstore'' in Portsmouth is also affiliated.\n\nSee also [https://web.archive.org/web/20060912164904/http://themusichall.org/schedule/signa_writers.cfm Writers on a New England Stage at the Music Hall's website]\n\n==Notable employees==\n*Mark Handley, NHPR's General Manager from 1990 to 2005, was chairman of NPR's Board of Directors for two terms.\n*Eric Westervelt, formerly a foreign correspondent for NPR who often reported on the Arab-Israeli conflict, was a reporter and news director at NHPR for several years.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.nhpr.org/ NHPR's official website]\n*[http://www.nhpr.org/schedule NHPR's program schedule]\n\n{{NPR New Hampshire}}\n{{American broadcast radio}}\n\n[[Category:Radio stations in New Hampshire|*]]\n[[Category:American radio networks]]\n[[Category:NPR member networks]]\n[[Category:Radio stations established in 1981]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox radio station\n|name               = New Hampshire Public Radio\n|image              = New Hampshire Public Radio logo.png\n|image_size         = 200px\n|city               = \n|area               = [[New Hampshire]] and bordering areas of [[Maine]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Vermont]] and [[Quebec]]\n|branding           = ''NHPR''\n|slogan             = \"News and information for the Granite State\"\n|frequency          = [[#Stations|see table below]]\n|translator         = [[#Translators|see table below]]\n|repeater           = \n|airdate            = {{Start date|1981|08|04}}\n|share              = \n|share as of        = \n|share source       = \n|format             = [[All-news radio|News]]/[[Talk radio|talk]]\n|language           = \n|power              = \n|erp                = \n|haat               = \n|class              = \n|facility_id        = \n|coordinates        = \n|callsign_meaning   = \n|former_callsigns   = \n|former_frequencies = \n|affiliations       = [[NPR]]<br>[[Public Radio International]]<br>[[American Public Media]]\n|owner              = New Hampshire Public Radio, Incorporated\n|licensee           = \n|sister_stations    = [[WCNH]]\n|webcast            = {{listenlive|http://nhpr-sc.streamguys.us/listen.pls}}\n|website            = {{URL|http://www.nhpr.org/}}\n}}\n\n'''New Hampshire Public Radio''' ('''NHPR''') is the [[National Public Radio]] member [[Radio network|network]] serving the state of [[New Hampshire]].

As has been the case with most other NPR member stations over the past decade and a half, the network dropped music programming (except for a handful of weekend features) by 2001 to carry news and information programming around the clock.\n\nLocal staff produces three hours each day of newscasts and feature reports on local New Hampshire news and two daily interview programs. ''The Exchange'', hosted by Laura Knoy, is a one-hour morning news and public affairs call-in show. ''Word of Mouth'', hosted by Justine Paradis, is a one-hour midday general topics interview show. NHPR also locally produces ''The Folk Show'', a live show featuring performances by local musicians, on Sunday evenings and hosted by Kate McNally.\n\nNHPR broadcasts the major daily news programs produced by NPR, including ''[[Morning Edition]]'' and ''[[All Things Considered]]''. The statewide network also broadcasts programming from [[American Public Media]], including ''[[Live from Here]]'' and ''[[Marketplace (radio program)|Marketplace]]'', as well as programs from [[Public Radio International]], including ''[[Studio 360]]'', ''[[The Takeaway]]'', ''[[This American Life]]''. NHPR also airs programming from international broadcasters, such as ''[[As It Happens]]'', the [[BBC World Service]] from Britain.\n\n==Writers on a New England Stage==\nNHPR, in conjunction with the [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire|Portsmouth]] [[The Music Hall (Portsmouth)|Music Hall]], has produced a series on New England writers and authors. So far the series has had such authors as [[John Updike]] (''[[Terrorist (novel)|Terrorist]]''), [[Doris Kearns Goodwin]], [[Dan Brown]] (''[[The Da Vinci Code]]''), [[Alan Alda]], and [[Mitch Albom]]. Virginia Prescott of ''Word of Mouth'' is the interviewer, and the trio [[Dreadnaught USA|Dreadnaught]] is the house band. The ''River Run Bookstore'' in Portsmouth is also affiliated.\n\nSee also [https://web.archive.org/web/20060912164904/http://themusichall.org/schedule/signa_writers.cfm Writers on a New England Stage at the Music Hall's website]\n\n==Notable employees==\n*Mark Handley, NHPR's General Manager from 1990 to 2005, was chairman of NPR's Board of Directors for two terms.\n*Eric Westervelt, formerly a foreign correspondent for NPR who often reported on the Arab-Israeli conflict, was a reporter and news director at NHPR for several years.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.nhpr.org/ NHPR's official website]\n*[http://www.nhpr.org/schedule NHPR's program schedule]\n\n{{NPR New Hampshire}}\n\n[[Category:Radio stations in New Hampshire|*]]\n[[Category:American radio networks]]\n[[Category:NPR member networks]]\n[[Category:Radio stations established in 1981]]\n", "name_user": "Ben76266", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire_Public_Radio"}
