This latter poet's many exploits live on in local folklore, as do his poetry and aislings (dramatic descriptions). His solo set dance, \"Rodney's Glory,\" was composed in 1783 and follows his adventures after being forced to join the British Navy. Sliabh Luachra was also the birthplace of the folklorist, poet, and translator Edward Walsh (1805\u20131850), [[Patrick S. Dinneen]], who compiled Dineen's Dictionary, viewed as the \"bible\" of Irish language, and Tom\u00e1s Rathaille, Superior General of the Presentation Brothers 1905\u20131925 who wrote two books of Irish poetry:  ''An Spideog'' and ''An Cuaic\u00edn Draoidheachta''. This tradition of poetry continues to present day with Bernard O'Donoghue (now a lecturer in Oxford University) who won the prestigious Whitbread prize for a collection of poems in 1993/94. Professor Daniel Corkery, author of ''The Hidden Ireland'' wrote that Sliabh Luachra was the literary capital of Ireland.<ref>http://www.sliabhluachra.com/history?page=2</ref>\n\nThis region has a unique musical style which makes heavy use of the [[polka]] and the [[Slide (tune type)|slide]].

This uninhabited wet, marshy, rushy, mountain area of the old [[Ciarraige Luachra |Kingdom of Luachra]] was first noted in the Annals of Inisfallen in 534 when the King of Luacar won a battle against Tuathal Moel nGarb. It came to light again in 741 AD with the death of Cuaine, Abbot of Ferna and Flan Ferna, son of Cormac King of Luachra.\n\nHundreds of years ago, the area was sparsely populated. It was an area of bogs, rushes, marshes, and woodlands, an area only suitable for refugees trying to avoid the imperial authorities. Its remoteness and the barren soil proved attractive to those people as the authorities were less likely to bother them in their inhospitable environment.\n\nSettlement did not come to the remaining thousand square miles of Sliabh Luachra until the [[Desmond Rebellions|Desmond rebellion]]. This rebellion ended with the death of [[Gerald Fitzgerald, 15th Earl of Desmond|Gerald Fitzgerald]], the 15th Earl of Desmond in 1583. His last hiding place, Teach an Iarla, can still be seen cut into a glen in the heart of the Sliabh Luachra mountains near the source of the [[Blackwater River (Kerry)|river Blackwater]]. The rebellion resulted in the scorched earth policy of Queen Elizabeth's army, which devastated much of [[Munster]]. Men, women and children were put to the sword and land and crops were burned, resulting in a great famine, impacting the area from Ventry to Cashel.\n\nFollowing this devastation, [[Munster]] began restoration with a half a million acres being declared Crown property and being distributed to English landlords. Former inhabitants were ordered to relocate to Connacht. Some of the dispossessed and poverty stricken people of Munster took refuge in Sliabh Luachra, which was also Crown property. Much of this land was recorded as mountain pastures; however, the authorities were unsuccessful at its distribution to landlords.\n\nThis area remained undisturbed and largely unaccounted for until the agrarian disturbances of the [[Rockite movement]] in the 1820s.<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/pss/30006930]</ref> The Rockite movement began in West Limerick in the summer of 1821. The first leader of the Rockite movement, known as Captain Rock, was a Patrick Dillane who may have come from the Sliabh Luachra area. Many of the leaders of the movement hid in Sliabh Luachra, thereby creating British Government concern over the area's preponderance of outlaws and rebels. Further, the Government was not receiving any revenues from the area and was unable to control the 960 square miles due to lack of roads and communication.\n\nA report by James Weale on the Crown Lands of [[County Cork]] addressed the Government's apprehensions in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]. It also pointed out that, in the summer, farmers from North Kerry and parts of West [[Limerick]] would transport butter on horseback via a [[mountain path]] through the [[Rockchapel]] to Newmarket, two firkins per horse. There, it was transferred to horse carts carrying 24 firkins and sent on to the largest butter market in the world in Cork City. In 1830, these farmers sent 30,000 firkins valued at 52,000, with much of it passing through the [[Rockchapel]] mountain path.\n\nThis report then initiated a program of road building, including the road from Castle Island to Clonbanin, from Ballydesmond to Newmarket, and the new line road, along the Feale Valley from Feales Bridge through Rockchapel to Newmarket, The engineering work on these roads and bridges was completed by [[Sir Richard Griffith, 1st Baronet|Richard Griffith]], who later became well known in Ireland through his Griffith valuations of 1852. The report also created the village of [[Ballydesmond|Kingwilliamstown]] (Ballydesmond), as was a model farm at Glencollins near [[Ballydesmond]]. Here, it was demonstrated that good grass could be grown on peaty soil by the use of burnt lime, resulting in the building of lime kilns in and around the Sliabh Luachra area.\n\nIn 1896, [[Gneeveguilla|Gneeveeguilla]] was the scene of the devastating moving bog, a landslide which wiped out an entire family as they slept.\n\nThe first [[Auxiliary Division]] fatality was killed in Rathmore on 11 July 1920.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nThe [[Headford Ambush]] took place at Barraduff in 1921. Thirty-two IRA volunteers ambushed a train carrying British soldiers. A total of sixteen people died including ten British soldiers, two IRA volunteers and four civilians.\n\n==Geography==\n\nOpinions differ as to the exact region of Sliabh Luachra, but it is generally accepted to refer to the mountainous, rush-filled upland that straddles the border area of Cork, Kerry, and [[County Limerick|Limerick]], including the Kerry parishes of [[Ballymacelligott]], Cordal, [[Brosna, County Kerry|Brosna]], Knocknagoshel, Barraduff, [[Gneeveguilla]], [[Scartaglen]] and [[Rathmore, County Kerry|Rathmore]], the Cork villages of [[Ballydesmond]], [[Kiskeam]], [[Rockchapel]], [[Knocknagree]], Cullen, Boherbue, [[Meelin]], and Freemount, and the Limerick villages of Killeedy[[Tournafulla]], [[Templeglantine]], [[Athea]], [[Mountcollins]] and [[Abbeyfeale]]\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe name Sliabh Luachra means \"a mountain of rushes\". However, it is not a single mountain, but a rolling plateau interspersed with what is generally accepted as its seven [[valley|glens]], or 'seacht ngleann Shliabh Luachra', over which various mountain peaks reach heights of 500 metres.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://archive.is/20070708040156/http://www.kennys.ie/Search_Results.aspx?profile=Books&view=single&barcode=0954142519 Kennys.ie \u2013 ''Sliabh Luachra Milestones''] History book by Diarmuid Moynihan\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20061108071038/http://www.greenmanreview.com/book/book_hickey_stonemad.html Stone Mad for Music: The Sliabh Luachra Story] (Marino Press, 1999)\n*[http://www.sliabhluachra.com/ ''Bruach Na Carraige''], local cultural project\n\n{{\u00d3 Conchobhair Ciarraighe}}\n{{coord missing|Ireland}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2013}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sliabh Luachra}}\n[[Category:Geography of County Cork]]\n[[Category:Geography of County Kerry]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=September 2013}}\n{{refimprove|date=October 2012}}\n'''Sliabh Luachra''' ({{IPA-ga|\u0283l\u02b2i\u0259v\u02e0 \u02c8l\u032a\u02e0u\u0259x\u027e\u02e0\u0259}}), sometimes anglicised 'Slieve Logher',<ref>Tempan, Paul.

Dinneen]], who compiled Dineen's Dictionary, viewed as the \"bible\" of Irish language, and Tom\u00e1s Rathaille, Superior General of the Presentation Brothers 1905\u20131925 who wrote two books of Irish poetry:  ''An Spideog'' and ''An Cuaic\u00edn Draoidheachta''. This tradition of poetry continues to present day with Bernard O'Donoghue (now a lecturer in Oxford University) who won the prestigious Whitbread prize for a collection of poems in 1993/94. Professor Daniel Corkery, author of ''The Hidden Ireland'' wrote that Sliabh Luachra was the literary capital of Ireland.<ref>http://www.sliabhluachra.com/history?page=2</ref>\n\nThis region has a unique musical style which makes heavy use of the [[polka]] and the [[Slide (tune type)|slide]]. Musicians from the area include [[Denis Murphy (Irish musician)|Denis Murphy]], [[Julia Clifford]], [[Paddy Cronin]], [[Padraig O'Keeffe]], [[Johnny O'Leary]], Maurice O' Keeffe, [[Jackie Daly]], Con Curtin and [[Donal Murphy]].\n\n==Religion==\n\n[[Mo Ling|St Moling]] was born in Sliabh Luachra in 614 AD.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicireland.net/books/197-saints-a-great-people/1384-saint-moling-luachra-a-pilgrimage-from-sliabh-luachra-to-rinn-ros-broic-above-the-stream-pools-of-the-barrow|title=Saint Moling Luachra: A pilgrimage from Sliabh Luachra to Rinn Ros Broic above the stream-pools of the Barrow |year=2011|publisher=CatholicIreland.net |accessdate=20 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nThe mountainous area along the Cork/Kerry border is known as Sliabh Luachra. This uninhabited wet, marshy, rushy, mountain area of the old [[Ciarraige Luachra |Kingdom of Luachra]] was first noted in the Annals of Inisfallen in 534 when the King of Luacar won a battle against Tuathal Moel nGarb. It came to light again in 741 AD with the death of Cuaine, Abbot of Ferna and Flan Ferna, son of Cormac King of Luachra.\n\nHundreds of years ago, the area was sparsely populated. It was an area of bogs, rushes, marshes, and woodlands, an area only suitable for refugees trying to avoid the imperial authorities. Its remoteness and the barren soil proved attractive to those people as the authorities were less likely to bother them in their inhospitable environment.\n\nSettlement did not come to the remaining thousand square miles of Sliabh Luachra until the [[Desmond Rebellions|Desmond rebellion]]. This rebellion ended with the death of [[Gerald Fitzgerald, 15th Earl of Desmond|Gerald Fitzgerald]], the 15th Earl of Desmond in 1583. His last hiding place, Teach an Iarla, can still be seen cut into a glen in the heart of the Sliabh Luachra mountains near the source of the [[Blackwater River (Kerry)|river Blackwater]]. The rebellion resulted in the scorched earth policy of Queen Elizabeth's army, which devastated much of [[Munster]]. Men, women and children were put to the sword and land and crops were burned, resulting in a great famine, impacting the area from Ventry to Cashel.\n\nFollowing this devastation, [[Munster]] began restoration with a half a million acres being declared Crown property and being distributed to English landlords. Former inhabitants were ordered to relocate to Connacht. Some of the dispossessed and poverty stricken people of Munster took refuge in Sliabh Luachra, which was also Crown property. Much of this land was recorded as mountain pastures; however, the authorities were unsuccessful at its distribution to landlords.\n\nThis area remained undisturbed and largely unaccounted for until the agrarian disturbances of the [[Rockite movement]] in the 1820s.<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/pss/30006930]</ref> The Rockite movement began in West Limerick in the summer of 1821. The first leader of the Rockite movement, known as Captain Rock, was a Patrick Dillane who may have come from the Sliabh Luachra area. Many of the leaders of the movement hid in Sliabh Luachra, thereby creating British Government concern over the area's preponderance of outlaws and rebels. Further, the Government was not receiving any revenues from the area and was unable to control the 960 square miles due to lack of roads and communication.\n\nA report by James Weale on the Crown Lands of [[County Cork]] addressed the Government's apprehensions in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]. It also pointed out that, in the summer, farmers from North Kerry and parts of West [[Limerick]] would transport butter on horseback via a [[mountain path]] through the [[Rockchapel]] to Newmarket, two firkins per horse. There, it was transferred to horse carts carrying 24 firkins and sent on to the largest butter market in the world in Cork City. In 1830, these farmers sent 30,000 firkins valued at 52,000, with much of it passing through the [[Rockchapel]] mountain path.\n\nThis report then initiated a program of road building, including the road from Castle Island to Clonbanin, from Ballydesmond to Newmarket, and the new line road, along the Feale Valley from Feales Bridge through Rockchapel to Newmarket, The engineering work on these roads and bridges was completed by Richard Griffith, who later became well known in Ireland through his Griffith valuations of 1852. The report also created the village of [[Ballydesmond|Kingwilliamstown]] (Ballydesmond), as was a model farm at Glencollins near [[Ballydesmond]]. Here, it was demonstrated that good grass could be grown on peaty soil by the use of burnt lime, resulting in the building of lime kilns in and around the Sliabh Luachra area.\n\nIn 1896, [[Gneeveguilla|Gneeveeguilla]] was the scene of the devastating moving bog, a landslide which wiped out an entire family as they slept.\n\nThe first [[Auxiliary Division]] fatality was killed in Rathmore on 11 July 1920.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nThe [[Headford Ambush]] took place at Barraduff in 1921. Thirty-two IRA volunteers ambushed a train carrying British soldiers. A total of sixteen people died including ten British soldiers, two IRA volunteers and four civilians.\n\n==Geography==\n\nOpinions differ as to the exact region of Sliabh Luachra, but it is generally accepted to refer to the mountainous, rush-filled upland that straddles the border area of Cork, Kerry, and [[County Limerick|Limerick]], including the Kerry parishes of [[Ballymacelligott]], Cordal, [[Brosna, County Kerry|Brosna]], Knocknagoshel, Barraduff, [[Gneeveguilla]], [[Scartaglen]] and [[Rathmore, County Kerry|Rathmore]], the Cork villages of [[Ballydesmond]], [[Kiskeam]], [[Rockchapel]], [[Knocknagree]], Cullen, Boherbue, [[Meelin]], and Freemount, and the Limerick villages of Killeedy[[Tournafulla]], [[Templeglantine]], [[Athea]], [[Mountcollins]] and [[Abbeyfeale]]\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe name Sliabh Luachra means \"a mountain of rushes\". However, it is not a single mountain, but a rolling plateau interspersed with what is generally accepted as its seven [[valley|glens]], or 'seacht ngleann Shliabh Luachra', over which various mountain peaks reach heights of 500 metres.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://archive.is/20070708040156/http://www.kennys.ie/Search_Results.aspx?profile=Books&view=single&barcode=0954142519 Kennys.ie \u2013 ''Sliabh Luachra Milestones''] History book by Diarmuid Moynihan\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20061108071038/http://www.greenmanreview.com/book/book_hickey_stonemad.html Stone Mad for Music: The Sliabh Luachra Story] (Marino Press, 1999)\n*[http://www.sliabhluachra.com/ ''Bruach Na Carraige''], local cultural project\n\n{{\u00d3 Conchobhair Ciarraighe}}\n{{coord missing|Ireland}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2013}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sliabh Luachra}}\n[[Category:Geography of County Cork]]\n[[Category:Geography of County Kerry]]\n", "name_user": "Vancouveriensis", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliabh_Luachra"}

The film also features the voices of [[Don Francks]], [[Greg Salata]], and [[Susan Roman]].\n\nCentring upon [[rock and roll]] music, ''Rock & Rule'' includes songs by [[Cheap Trick]], [[Chris Stein]] and [[Debbie Harry]] of the pop group [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]], [[Lou Reed]], [[Iggy Pop]], and [[Earth, Wind & Fire]]. The story takes place in a [[post-apocalyptic]] [[United States]] populated by [[mutant (fiction)|mutant]] [[humanoid]] [[animal]]s. Though initially underperformed at the box office, the movie has gone on to gain both popularity and a [[Cult following|cult following]].<ref name=LA />\n\n==Overview==\n''Rock & Rule'' was a heavily derived spinoff of Nelvana's earlier TV special from 1978, ''[[The Devil and Daniel Mouse]]''. [[United Artists]] was to distribute the movie, but when they were purchased by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the new management team had no interest in it. As a result, it was never released in North America except for a limited release in [[Boston, Massachusetts]].  It received minor attention in Germany, where it was screened at a [[film festival]]. It was funded in part by the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]], which had obtained the Canadian TV rights. A hard-to-find [[VHS]] was released at that time, followed by a [[LaserDisc|laserdisc]] release. The film developed a [[cult following]] from repeated airings on [[HBO]] and [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] and the circulation of bootleg VHS copies at [[comic book convention]] booths (with [[Ralph Bakshi]] incorrectly named as director). In 2005, [[Unearthed Films]] released a special two-disc edition [[DVD]] of the film.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the American release, an introduction states that in 1983, a [[nuclear]] [[World War 3]] had erupted between the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States of America]] which destroyed each other and the [[human race]], leading to the creation of humanoid animals. \n\nMok, an aging yet legendary rock musician, is on the search for a very special voice that can unleash a powerful demon from another dimension, his dwindling popularity driving him to destroy the world in vengeance and immortalize himself in the process. After travelling around the world looking for the right voice, he returns to his hometown of Ohmtown, a remote, storm-ravaged village famous for its unique power plant. Meanwhile, at a nightclub, Omar, Angel, Dizzy and Stretch perform in a small [[rock band]]. As Angel performs her romantic ballad to a mostly empty audience, Mok hears her sing; he realizes that Angel has the voice he needs when a ring he is wearing reacts to her voice. Mok invites Angel and the band to his mansion outside of town, where the band is formally introduced to him and his assistants, the \"Rollerskating Schlepper Brothers\" Toad, Sleazy and Zip. Mok incapacitates Omar and Stretch with hypnotic \"Edison Balls\" as he takes Angel on a stroll through his garden and tries to convince her to join him. Although Angel is unaware of Mok's true intentions, she refuses to abandon her band. Unwilling to admit defeat, Mok kidnaps her and takes his blimp to Nuke York, where his summoning, disguised as a concert, will be performed.\n\nFollowing their ejection from Mok's mansion, the band find out what happened to Angel and they follow the blimp in a stolen police car. Before they reach Nuke York, they are arrested by a border guard. Meanwhile, Angel attempts to escape with the unwitting help of Cinderella, the sister of the Schleppers. While sneaking through the ventilation system, Angel overhears Mok confirming his plans with his computer. At this time, the computer informs Mok that the only way to stop the demon is with \"One voice, one heart, one song\", but when Mok asks who can do this, the computer replies that there is \"no one\". Angel and Cindy escape the building and head to the zero-gravity dance club \"Club 666\", unaware that the Schleppers are following them. Dizzy's aunt bails out Omar and his friends, and tells them of the club. Angel and Cindy are intercepted and taken back to Mok's apartment, and the band tries to follow. Omar eventually bumps into Mok, who uses an impersonator to fool Omar into thinking that Angel has fallen for Mok. To manipulate Angel, Mok captures the band and tortures them with a giant Edison Ball to force her to agree with his demands. He also brainwashes them to ensure that they stay out of the way. The Nuke York concert turns out to be a disaster due to a power failure. Because the invocation requires a titanic amount of electricity, Mok relocates the summoning to Ohmtown, whose power plant has enough energy, though Zip expresses childlike doubts about whether their actions are good or evil. During the concert, a power surge causes overloads all over the city. The shock also brings Omar and his friends out of their hypnosis.\n\nStretch finds a poster advertising Mok and Angel's concert and Dizzy sticks with him to save her. After confessing that Omar saw Mok and Angel together, Stretch tries to remind him it's all mind games. Omar, still believing Mok's earlier deception, refuses to help Dizzy and Stretch stop the concert. They go without him in a stolen police car, but crash at the concert too late, as Mok forces Angel to summon the demon with her song. But Omar has a change of heart and arrives to free Angel from her electronic shackles before the demon can turn on her. When the demon attacks Omar, Zip seemingly sacrifices himself to save Omar's life. Angel tries singing to force the demon back, but her lone voice has no effect. But Omar joins in harmony with Angel, and thus the creature is weakened and driven back into its own dimension.

The film also features the voices of [[Don Francks]], [[Greg Salata]], and [[Susan Roman]].\n\nCentring upon [[rock and roll]] music, ''Rock & Rule'' includes songs by [[Cheap Trick]], [[Chris Stein]] and [[Debbie Harry]] of the pop group [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]], [[Lou Reed]], [[Iggy Pop]], and [[Earth, Wind & Fire]]. The story takes place in a [[post-apocalyptic]] [[United States]] populated by [[mutant (fiction)|mutant]] [[humanoid]] [[animal]]s. Though initially underperformed at the box office, the movie has gone on to gain both popularity and a [[Cult following|cult following]].<ref name=LA />\n\n==Overview==\n''Rock & Rule'' was a heavily derived spinoff of Nelvana's earlier TV special from 1978, ''[[The Devil and Daniel Mouse]]''. [[United Artists]] was to distribute the movie, but when they were purchased by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the new management team had no interest in it. As a result, it was never released in North America except for a limited release in [[Boston, Massachusetts]].  It received minor attention in Germany, where it was screened at a [[film festival]]. It was funded in part by the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]], which had obtained the Canadian TV rights. A hard-to-find [[VHS]] was released at that time, followed by a [[LaserDisc|laserdisc]] release. The film developed a [[cult following]] from repeated airings on [[HBO]] and [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] and the circulation of bootleg VHS copies at [[comic book convention]] booths (with [[Ralph Bakshi]] incorrectly named as director). In 2005, [[Unearthed Films]] released a special two-disc edition [[DVD]] of the film.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the American release, an introduction states that in 1983, a [[nuclear]] [[World War 3]] had erupted between the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States of America]] which destroyed each other and the [[human race]], leading to the creation of humanoid animals. \n\nMok, an aging yet legendary rock musician, is on the search for a very special voice that can unleash a powerful demon from another dimension, his dwindling popularity driving him to destroy the world in vengeance and immortalize himself in the process. After travelling around the world looking for the right voice, he returns to his hometown of Ohmtown, a remote, storm-ravaged village famous for its unique power plant. Meanwhile, at a nightclub, Omar, Angel, Dizzy and Stretch perform in a small [[rock band]]. As Angel performs her romantic ballad to a mostly empty audience, Mok hears her sing; he realizes that Angel has the voice he needs when a ring he is wearing reacts to her voice. Mok invites Angel and the band to his mansion outside of town, where the band is formally introduced to him and his assistants, the \"Rollerskating Schlepper Brothers\" Toad, Sleazy and Zip. Mok incapacitates Omar and Stretch with hypnotic \"Edison Balls\" as he takes Angel on a stroll through his garden and tries to convince her to join him. Although Angel is unaware of Mok's true intentions, she refuses to abandon her band. Unwilling to admit defeat, Mok kidnaps her and takes his blimp to Nuke York, where his summoning, disguised as a concert, will be performed.\n\nFollowing their ejection from Mok's mansion, the band find out what happened to Angel and they follow the blimp in a stolen police car. Before they reach Nuke York, they are arrested by a border guard. Meanwhile, Angel attempts to escape with the unwitting help of Cinderella, the sister of the Schleppers. While sneaking through the ventilation system, Angel overhears Mok confirming his plans with his computer. At this time, the computer informs Mok that the only way to stop the demon is with \"One voice, one heart, one song\", but when Mok asks who can do this, the computer replies that there is \"no one\". Angel and Cindy escape the building and head to the zero-gravity dance club \"Club 666\", unaware that the Schleppers are following them. Dizzy's aunt bails out Omar and his friends, and tells them of the club. Angel and Cindy are intercepted and taken back to Mok's apartment, and the band tries to follow. Omar eventually bumps into Mok, who uses an impersonator to fool Omar into thinking that Angel has fallen for Mok. To manipulate Angel, Mok captures the band and tortures them with a giant Edison Ball to force her to agree with his demands. He also brainwashes them to ensure that they stay out of the way. The Nuke York concert turns out to be a disaster due to a power failure. Because the invocation requires a titanic amount of electricity, Mok relocates the summoning to Ohmtown, whose power plant has enough energy, though Zip expresses childlike doubts about whether their actions are good or evil. During the concert, a power surge causes overloads all over the city. The shock also brings Omar and his friends out of their hypnosis.\n\nStretch finds a poster advertising Mok and Angel's concert and Dizzy sticks with him to save her. After confessing that Omar saw Mok and Angel together, Stretch tries to remind him it's all mind games. Omar, still believing Mok's earlier deception, refuses to help Dizzy and Stretch stop the concert. They go without him in a stolen police car, but crash at the concert too late, as Mok forces Angel to summon the demon with her song. But Omar has a change of heart and arrives to free Angel from her electronic shackles before the demon can turn on her. When the demon attacks Omar, Zip seemingly sacrifices himself to save Omar's life. Angel tries singing to force the demon back, but her lone voice has no effect. But Omar joins in harmony with Angel, and thus the creature is weakened and driven back into its own dimension. Mok is thrown into the portal by the vengeful Toad, and as he is sealed away, he realizes that \"no one\" did not mean that the demon could be stopped; it meant instead that \"no ''one'' voice\" could, acting alone; two voices and two hearts singing as one were needed for the counter-spell. The audience believes the confrontation to have been part of the concert's theatrics, and the band continues their song in triumph.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Greg Salata]] voices Omar (animated by Frank Nissen<ref name=\"Characters\">{{cite magazine |last=Kraft |first=David Anthony |date=1983 |title=From A(ngel) TO Z(ip): The Characters of Rock & Rule |url= |magazine=Marvel Super Special #25 |location= |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref>) in the Canadian version.\n** [[Paul Le Mat]] voices Omar in the American version of the film.\n** [[Robin Zander]] supplies Omar's singing voice.\n* [[Susan Roman]] voices Angel (animated by Anne-Marie Bardwell<ref name=\"Characters\"/>).\n** [[Debbie Harry]] provides Angel's singing voice.\n* [[Don Francks]] voices Mok/Mok Swagger (animated by Robin Budd<ref name=\"Characters\"/>).\n** [[Lou Reed]] provides the singing voice for \"My Name is Mok\" and \"Triumph\"; [[Iggy Pop]] provides the singing voice for \"Pain & Suffering\".\n* Samantha Langevin is the voice of Mok's computer.\n* [[Dan Hennessey]] is Dizzy (real name Alphonse) (animated by [[Charles Bonifacio]]).\n* Greg Duffel voices Stretch and Zip.\n* [[Chris Wiggins]] is Toad (animated by Chuck Gammage).\n* [[Brent Titcomb]] voices Sleazy.\n* Donny Burns plays first radio announcer and Quadhole (animated by John Celestri<ref name=\"Characters\"/>).\n* [[Martin Lavut]] voices second radio announcer and Mylar (animated by John Celestri).\n* Catherine Gallant voices Cindy (animated by John Celestri).\n* [[Keith Hampshire]] voices other computers.\n* [[Melleny Melody|Melleny Brown]] plays a [[Carnegie Hall]] groupie.\n* Anna Bouroque voices Edna, a.k.a. \"What's Her Face\".\n* Nick Nichols voices border guard.\n* John Halfpenny plays Uncle Mikey.\n* [[Maurice LaMarche]] is sailor.\n* [[Catherine O'Hara]] plays Aunt Edith (animated by Chuck Gammage).\n\n==Production==\n''Rock & Rule'' was [[Nelvana]]'s first animated feature film, and the first Canadian animated feature to be produced in English (''Le Village enchant\u00e9'', a 1956 production from [[Quebec]], was the country's first, overall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cftpa.ca/newsroom/pdf/cftpakidsfinalfacing.pdf#page=24|author=Nordicity Group Ltd.|title=The Case for Kids Programming: Children's and Youth Audio-Visual Production in Canada|page=24|date=February 2007|accessdate=2010-05-07|publisher=Canadian Film and Television Production Association|quote=1956: ''Le Village enchant\u00e9'', becomes Canada\u2019s first animated feature film}}</ref>).
