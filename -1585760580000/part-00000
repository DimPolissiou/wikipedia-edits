The name is a registered trademark of [[The Chemours Company]] previous Du Pont de Nemours and was introduced in 1957.\n\nViton fluoroelastomers are categorized under the [[ASTM]] D1418 and [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 1629 designation of [[FKM]].

Nominal polymer [[fluorine]] content: 68%.\n# F (terpolymers of VF2/HFP/TFE): oxygenated automotive fuels, concentrated aqueous inorganic acids, water, steam. Nominal polymer [[fluorine]] content: 70%.\n# Specialty types include GLT, GBLT, GFLT & Viton Extreme (copolymers of TFE/propylene and ethylene/TFE/PMVE): automotive, oil exploration, special sealing and ultra-harsh environments.\n\n== Applications ==\nThe performance of fluoroelastomers in aggressive chemicals depends on the nature of the base polymer and the compounding ingredients used for molding the final products (e.g. [[O-ring|O-rings]]).

Viton is used because it has a lower probability of catching fire, even with the increased percentages of oxygen found in nitrox. It is also less susceptible to decay under increased oxygen conditions.\n\nViton is used in [[Aftermarket (merchandise)|after-market]] float valves (\"needle and seats\") for [[SU carburetor]]s, for its fuel resistance and resiliency for sealing.\n\nViton [[O-ring|O-rings]] are an upgrade to the original neoprene seals on Corvair pushrod tubes that deteriorated under the high heat produced by the engine, allowing oil leakage.\n\nViton tubing or Viton lined hoses are commonly recommended in automotive and other transportation fuel applications when high concentrations of biodiesel are required.

He has held several sensitive military, security, and intelligence offices, culminating in his appointment as the [[Sani Abacha#Security|Chief Security Officer to the Head of State]], military dictator General [[Sani Abacha]] from November 1993 to June 1998. \n\n== Early life ==\nHamza al-Mustapha was born and educated in [[Yobe State]]. He secretly enrolled as an officer cadet at the [[Nigerian Defence Academy]] and was commissioned into the [[Nigerian Army]] as a [[second lieutenant]]. \n\n== Rise to power ==\n\n=== Military intelligence ===\nAl-Mustapha was trained as a military intelligence operative. He was involved in at least two investigations of coup attempts; he also conducted operations in [[Chadian\u2013Libyan conflict|Chad]], [[First Liberian Civil War|Liberia]] and [[Sierra Leone Civil War|Sierra Leone]]. His conduct of interrogations brought him to the attention of General [[Sani Abacha]].\n\n=== [[Armed Forces Ruling Council (Nigeria)|Third Junta]] ===\nFrom August 1985 to August 1990, Al-Mustapha was [[Aide-de-camp|Aide-de-Camp]] (ADC) to [[Chief of Army Staff (Nigeria)|Chief of Army Staff]], General Sani Abacha. Both his principal and head of state, General [[Ibrahim Babangida]] had absolute confidence in his abilities, and entrusted him with exceptional powers, considerably greater than other officers who were nominally his superior.\n\nThis further projected him as a strongman of the military hierarchy.<ref>{{cite book|author=David S.

Rehnquist|Chief Justice William Rehnquist]] presiding]]\n\nThe Constitution concentrates removal powers in the Congress by empowering and obligating the House of Representatives to [[Impeachment in the United States|impeach]] both executive and judicial officials for \"Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors\". Impeachment is a ''formal accusation'' of unlawful activity by a civil officer or government official. The Senate is constitutionally empowered and obligated to try all impeachments. A simple majority in the House is required to impeach an official; however, a two-thirds majority in the Senate is required for conviction. A convicted official is automatically removed from office; in addition, the Senate may stipulate that the [[defendant]] be banned from holding office in the future. Impeachment proceedings may not inflict more than this; however, a convicted party may face criminal penalties in a normal court of law. In the history of the United States, the House of Representatives has impeached sixteen officials, of whom seven were convicted. Another resigned before the Senate could complete the trial. Only three presidents have ever been impeached: [[Andrew Johnson]] in 1868, [[Bill Clinton]] in 1999, and [[Donald Trump]] in 2020.  All three [[trial (law)|trials]] ended in acquittal; in Johnson's case, the Senate fell one vote short of the two-thirds majority required for [[conviction (law)|conviction]]. In 1974, [[Richard Nixon]] resigned from office after impeachment proceedings in the [[House Judiciary Committee]] indicated he would eventually be removed from office.\n\nThe Senate has an important check on the executive power by confirming [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]] officials, judges, and other high officers \"by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate\". It confirms most presidential nominees but rejections are not uncommon. Furthermore, treaties negotiated by the President must be ratified by a two-thirds majority vote in the Senate to take effect. As a result, presidential arm-twisting of senators can happen before a key vote; for example, President Obama's secretary of state, [[Hillary Clinton]], urged her former senate colleagues to approve a nuclear arms treaty with Russia in 2010.<ref name=tws2010Sep11rr>{{cite news |author= Charles Wolfson |title= Clinton Presses Senate to Ratify Nuclear Arms Treaty with Russia\n|publisher= CBS News |date= August 11, 2010 |url= http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20013329-503544.html |accessdate=September 11, 2010}}</ref> The House of Representatives has no formal role in either the ratification of treaties or the appointment of federal officials, other than in [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution#Section 2: Vice Presidential vacancy|filling a vacancy]] in the office of the vice president; in such a case, a majority vote in each House is required to confirm a president's nomination of a vice president.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/>\n\nIn 1803, the Supreme Court established [[judicial review]] of federal legislation in ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'', holding, however, that Congress could not grant unconstitutional power to the Court itself. The Constitution does not explicitly state that the courts may exercise judicial review; however, the notion that courts could declare laws [[unconstitutional]] was envisioned by the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|founding fathers]]. [[Alexander Hamilton]], for example, mentioned and expounded upon the doctrine in [[Federalist No. 78]].

Some members of Congress are elected by their peers to be officers of these committees. Further, Congress has ancillary organizations such as the [[Government Accountability Office]] and the [[Library of Congress]] to help provide it with information, and members of Congress have staff and offices to assist them as well. In addition, a vast industry of lobbyists helps members write legislation on behalf of diverse corporate and labor interests.\n\n===Committees===\n[[File:The United States Legislative Process - Committee Consideration (3) - Library of Congress.webm|thumb|Library of Congress video explanation of committees in the United States Congress]] \n[[File:Congress Hall committee room 2.jpg|thumb|alt=Photo of a table with chairs.|Second committee room in [[Congress Hall]] in [[Philadelphia]]]]\n{{Main|United States congressional committee}}\n\n====Specializations====\nThe committee structure permits members of Congress to study a particular subject intensely. It is neither expected nor possible that a member be an expert on all subject areas before Congress.<ref name=\"english-46\">English (2003), pp. 46\u201347</ref> As time goes by, members develop expertise in particular subjects and their legal aspects.

While procedures, such as the House [[discharge petition]] process, can introduce bills to the House floor and effectively bypass committee input, yet they are exceedingly difficult to implement without committee action. Committees have power and have been called ''independent fiefdoms''. Legislative, oversight, and internal administrative tasks are divided among about two hundred committees and [[United States congressional subcommittee|subcommittees]] which gather information, evaluate alternatives, and identify problems.<ref name=\"House_Rules\"/> They propose solutions for consideration by the full chamber.<ref name=\"House_Rules\"/> In addition, they perform the function of ''oversight'' by monitoring the executive branch and investigating wrongdoing.<ref name=\"House_Rules\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20100423162313/http://www.rules.house.gov/archives/98-241.pdf Committee Types and Roles], [[Congressional Research Service]], April 1, 2003</ref>\n\n====Officer====\nAt the start of each two-year session the House elects a [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|speaker]] who does not normally preside over debates but serves as the majority party's leader. In the Senate, the vice president is the [[ex officio]] ''president'' of the Senate. In addition, the Senate elects an officer called the [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|president pro tempore]]. ''Pro tempore'' means ''for the time being'' and this office is usually held by the most senior member of the Senate's majority party and customarily keeps this position until there is a change in party control. Accordingly, the Senate does not necessarily elect a new president pro tempore at the beginning of a new Congress. In both the House and Senate, the actual presiding officer is generally a junior member of the majority party who is appointed so that new members become acquainted with the rules of the chamber.\n\n===Support services===\n====Library of Congress====\n[[File:Thomas Jefferson Building Aerial by Carol M. Highsmith.jpg|thumb|Library of Congress Jefferson Building]]\n{{Main|Library of Congress}}\nThe Library of Congress was established by an act of Congress in 1800. It is primarily housed in three buildings on [[Capitol Hill]], but also includes several other sites: the [[National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped]] in Washington, D.C.; the [[National Audio-Visual Conservation Center]] in Culpeper, Virginia; a large [[book storage]] facility located at Ft. Meade, Maryland; and multiple overseas offices. The Library had mostly law books when it was burned by a British raiding party during the [[War of 1812]], but the library's collections were restored and expanded when Congress authorized the purchase of [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s private library. One of the library's missions is to serve the Congress and its staff as well as the American public. It is the largest library in the world with nearly 150 million items including books, films, maps, photographs, music, manuscripts, graphics, and materials in 470 languages.<ref name=aboutLOC>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/about/generalinfo.html|title=General Information \u2013 Library of Congress|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n====Congressional Research Service====\n[[File:Congressional Research Service.svg|alt=|thumb]]\n{{Main|Congressional Research Service}}\nThe Congressional Research Service, part of the Library of Congress, provides detailed, up-to-date and non-partisan research for senators, representatives, and their staff to help them carry out their official duties.

[[Advocacy group|Lobby groups]] and their members sometimes write legislation and [[Whip (politics)|whip]] bills. In 2007, there were approximately 17,000 federal lobbyists in Washington, D.C.<ref>{{cite book |title=Washington Representatives|edition=32|date=November 2007|publisher=Columbia Books|location=Bethesda, MD|isbn=978-1-880873-55-7|page=949}}</ref> They explain to legislators the goals of their organizations.

The period after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] was marked by partisanship, as is the case today. It is generally easier for committees to reach accord on issues when compromise is possible. Some [[Political science|political scientists]] speculate that a prolonged period marked by narrow majorities in both chambers of Congress has intensified partisanship in the last few decades, but that an alternation of control of Congress between Democrats and Republicans may lead to greater flexibility in policies, as well as pragmatism and civility within the institution.<ref name=tws2010Sep11t14cc577>{{cite book |author1=Steven S.

A new session commences on January 3 each year, unless Congress decides differently. The Constitution requires Congress meet at least once each year and forbids either house from meeting outside the Capitol without the consent of the other house.\n\n===Joint sessions===\n{{Main|Joint session of the United States Congress}}\nJoint sessions of the United States Congress occur on special occasions that require a concurrent resolution from both House and Senate. These sessions include counting [[electoral votes]] after a presidential election and the president's [[State of the Union]] address. The [[State of the Union|constitutionally mandated report]], normally given as an annual speech, is modeled on Britain's [[Speech from the Throne]], was written by most presidents after [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]] but personally delivered as a spoken oration beginning with [[Woodrow Wilson|Wilson]] in 1913. Joint Sessions and Joint Meetings are traditionally presided over by the speaker of the House, except when counting presidential electoral votes when the vice president (acting as the president of the Senate) presides.\n\n===Bills and resolutions===\n{{See also|Act of Congress|List of United States federal legislation}}\n[[File:Private Law 86-407.jpg|An [[Act of Congress]] from 1960.|thumb]]\n[[File:US House Committee.jpg|thumb|right|The [[House Financial Services committee]] meets. Committee members sit in the tiers of raised chairs, while those testifying and audience members sit below.]]\n\nIdeas for legislation can come from members, lobbyists, state legislatures, constituents, legislative counsel, or executive agencies. Anyone can write a bill, but only members of Congress may introduce bills. Most bills are not written by Congress members, but originate from the Executive branch; interest groups often draft bills as well. The usual next step is for the proposal to be passed to a committee for review.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/> A proposal is usually in one of these forms:\n\n* '''Bills''' are laws in the making. A House-originated bill begins with the letters \"H.R.\" for \"House of Representatives\", followed by a number kept as it progresses.<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/>\n* '''Joint resolutions'''. There is little difference between a bill and a joint resolution since both are treated similarly; a joint resolution originating from the House, for example, begins \"H.J.Res.\" followed by its number.<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/>\n* '''Concurrent Resolutions''' affect only both the House and Senate and accordingly are not presented to the president for approval later. In the House, they begin with \"H.Con.Res.\"<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/>\n* '''Simple resolutions''' concern only the House or only the Senate and begin with \"H.Res.\" or \"S.Res.\"<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/>\n\nRepresentatives introduce a bill while the House is in session by placing it in the ''hopper'' on the Clerk's desk.<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> It is assigned a number and referred to a committee which studies each bill intensely at this stage.<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> Drafting statutes requires \"great skill, knowledge, and experience\" and sometimes take a year or more.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/> Sometimes lobbyists write legislation and submit it to a member for introduction. Joint resolutions are the normal way to propose a constitutional amendment or declare war. On the other hand, concurrent resolutions (passed by both houses) and simple resolutions (passed by only one house) do not have the force of law but express the opinion of Congress or regulate [[Parliamentary procedure|procedure]]. Bills may be introduced by any member of either house. However, the Constitution states, \"All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives.\" While the Senate cannot originate [[revenue]] and [[Appropriations bill (United States)|appropriation bills]], it has power to amend or reject them. Congress has sought ways to establish appropriate spending levels.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/>\n\nEach chamber determines its own internal rules of operation unless specified in the Constitution or prescribed by law. In the House, a [[U.S. House Committee on Rules|Rules Committee]] guides legislation; in the Senate, a [[Standing Rules of the Senate|Standing Rules]] committee is in charge. Each branch has its own traditions; for example, the Senate relies heavily on the practice of getting \"unanimous consent\" for noncontroversial matters.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/> House and Senate rules can be complex, sometimes requiring a hundred specific steps before a bill can become a law.<ref name=tws2010Sep11t14aa/> Members sometimes turn to outside experts to learn about proper Congressional procedures.<ref name=tws2010Sep11nn>{{cite news |author= Partnership for Public Service |title= Walter Oleszek: A Hill Staffer's Guide to Congressional History and Habit |newspaper= The Washington Post |date= March 29, 2009 |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/27/AR2009032701563.html |accessdate=September 11, 2010}}</ref>\n\nEach bill goes through several stages in each house including consideration by a committee and advice from the [[Government Accountability Office]].<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/> Most legislation is considered by [[standing committee]]s which have jurisdiction over a particular subject such as Agriculture or Appropriations. The House has twenty standing committees; the Senate has sixteen. Standing committees meet at least once each month.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/> Almost all standing committee meetings for transacting business must be open to the public unless the committee votes, publicly, to close the meeting.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/> A committee might call for public hearings on important bills.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/> Each committee is led by a [[chairperson|chair]] who belongs to the majority party and a [[ranking minority member|ranking member]] of the minority party. Witnesses and experts can present their case for or against a bill.<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> Then, a bill may go to what is called a ''mark-up'' session, where committee members debate the bill's merits and may offer amendments or revisions.<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> Committees may also amend the bill, but the full house holds the power to accept or reject committee amendments. After debate, the committee votes whether it wishes to report the measure to the full house. If a bill is ''tabled'' then it is rejected. If amendments are extensive, sometimes a new bill with amendments built in will be submitted as a so-called ''clean bill'' with a new number.<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> Both houses have procedures under which committees can be bypassed or overruled but they are rarely used. Generally, members who have been in Congress longer have greater seniority and therefore greater power.<ref name=tws2010Sep11qq/>\n\nA bill which reaches the floor of the full house can be simple or complex<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> and begins with an [[enacting formula]] such as \"Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled.\" Consideration of a bill requires, itself, a ''rule'' which is a simple resolution specifying the particulars of debate\u2014time limits, possibility of further amendments, and such.<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> Each side has equal time and members can yield to other members who wish to speak.<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> Sometimes opponents seek to ''recommit'' a bill which means to change part of it.<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> Generally, discussion requires a ''quorum'', usually half of the total number of representatives, before discussion can begin, although there are exceptions.<ref name=tws2010Sep11mm>{{cite news |title= News from Washington |newspaper= The New York Times |date= December 3, 1861 |url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30611FA38541A7493C1A91789D95F458684F9 |archive-url= https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20171010131909/http://www.nytimes.com/1861/12/03/news/washington-meeting-thirty-seventh-congress-quorum-present-both-houses-business.html |url-status = dead|archive-date= October 10, 2017 |accessdate= September 11, 2010 }}</ref> The house may debate and amend the bill; the precise procedures used by the House and Senate differ.

For the bill to become law, both houses must agree to identical versions of the bill.<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> If the second house amends the bill, then the differences between the two versions must be reconciled in a [[United States congressional conference committee|conference committee]], an ''ad hoc'' committee that includes both senators and representatives<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> sometimes by using a ''reconciliation process'' to limit budget bills.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/> Both houses use a budget enforcement mechanism informally known as ''pay-as-you-go'' or ''paygo'' which discourages members from considering acts which increase budget deficits.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/> If both houses agree to the version reported by the conference committee, the bill passes, otherwise it fails.\n\nThe Constitution specifies that a majority of members, known as a ''[[quorum]],'' be present before doing business in each house. However, the rules of each house assume that a quorum is present unless a [[quorum call]] demonstrates the contrary and debate often continues despite the lack of a majority.\n\nVoting within Congress can take many forms, including systems using lights and bells and electronic voting.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/> Both houses use voice voting to decide most matters in which members shout \"aye\" or \"no\" and the presiding officer announces the result. The Constitution, however, requires a [[Voting methods in deliberative assemblies|recorded vote]] if demanded by one-fifth of the members present or when voting to override a presidential veto. If the voice vote is unclear or if the matter is controversial, a recorded vote usually happens. The Senate uses [[Voting methods in deliberative assemblies|roll-call voting]], in which a clerk calls out the names of all the senators, each senator stating \"aye\" or \"no\" when their name is announced. In the Senate, the Vice President may cast the tie-breaking vote if present when the Senators are equally divided.\n\nThe House reserves roll-call votes for the most formal matters, as a roll call of all 435 representatives takes quite some time; normally, members vote by using an electronic device. In the case of a tie, the motion in question fails. Most votes in the House are done electronically, allowing members to vote ''yea'' or ''nay'' or ''present'' or ''open''.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/> Members insert a voting ''ID card'' and can change their votes during the last five minutes if they choose; in addition, paper ballots are used on some occasions\u2014''yea'' indicated by green and ''nay'' by red.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/> One member cannot cast a [[proxy vote]] for another.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/> Congressional votes are recorded on an online database.<ref name=tws2010Sep11gg>{{cite news |author= United States government |title= Recent Votes |publisher= United States Senate |year= 2010 |url= https://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/legislative/a_three_sections_with_teasers/votes.htm |accessdate=September 11, 2010}}</ref><ref name=tws2010Sep11t7>{{cite news|title=The U.S. Congress \u2013 Votes Database \u2013 Members of Congress / Robert Byrd |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=June 17, 2010 |url=http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/k000105/ |accessdate=September 11, 2010 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101110035120/http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/k000105/ |archivedate=November 10, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nAfter passage by both houses, a bill is [[Enrolled bill|enrolled]] and sent to the president for approval.<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> The president may sign it making it law or veto it, perhaps returning it to Congress with the president's objections.

Legislators who \"burnish a reputation for policy expertise and leadership\".\n# '''''Power in the chamber.'''''

This constitutionally derived immunity applies to members during sessions and when traveling to and from sessions.<ref>Davidson (2006), p. 17</ref> The term ''arrest'' has been interpreted broadly, and includes any detention or delay in the course of [[Police|law enforcement]], including [[Summons|court summons]] and [[subpoena]]s. The rules of the House strictly guard this privilege; a member may not waive the privilege on their own, but must seek the permission of the whole house to do so. Senate rules, however, are less strict and permit individual senators to waive the privilege as they choose.\n\nThe Constitution guarantees absolute freedom of debate in both houses, providing in the [[Speech or Debate Clause]] of the Constitution that \"for any Speech or Debate in either House, they shall not be questioned in any other Place\". Accordingly, a member of Congress may not be sued in court for [[slander]] because of remarks made in either house, although each house has its own rules restricting offensive speeches, and may punish members who transgress.\n\nObstructing the work of Congress is a crime under [[federal law]] and is known as [[contempt of Congress]]. Each member has the power to cite individuals for contempt but can only issue a contempt citation\u2014the judicial system pursues the matter like a normal criminal case. If convicted in court, an individual found guilty of contempt of Congress may be imprisoned for up to one year.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nThe [[franking]] privilege allows members of Congress to send official mail to constituents at government expense.

government]] of the [[United States]], and consists of two chambers: the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. The Congress meets in the [[United States Capitol]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] Both senators and representatives are chosen through [[direct election]], though vacancies in the Senate may be filled by a [[Governor (United States)|gubernatorial]] appointment. Congress has 535 voting members: 435 representatives and 100 senators. In addition, the House of Representatives currently has six [[Non-voting members of the United States House of Representatives|non-voting members]], bringing the total membership of the US Congress to 541<ref>{{cite web|url=https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R45583|title=Membership of the 116th Congress: A Profile|page=4|website=[[Congressional Research Service]]|accessdate=5 March 2020|quote=Congress is composed of 541 individuals from the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, and Puerto Rico.}}</ref> or fewer in the case of vacancies.\n\nThe members of the House of Representatives serve two-year terms representing the people of a single constituency, known as a ''district''. [[Congressional districts of the United States|Congressional districts]] are [[United States congressional apportionment|apportioned]] to [[U.S. state|states]] by [[Representation by population|population]] using the [[United States Census]] results, provided that each state has at least ''one congressional representative. Each state'', regardless of population or size, has two senators. Currently, there are 100 senators representing the 50 states. Each senator is elected at-large in their state for a six-year term, with [[Staggered elections|terms staggered]], so every two years approximately one-third of the Senate is up for election.\n\n[[Article One of the United States Constitution]] requires that members of Congress must be aged at least 25 (House) or 30 (Senate), have been a citizen of the United States for seven (House) or nine (Senate) years, and be an inhabitant of the [[U.S. state|state]] which they represent. A small number of senators in the 19th century were [[List of youngest members of the United States Congress|under 30 years old]] and therefore did not meet the constitutional age requirement.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cop.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Youngest_Senator.htm|title=Youngest Senator|publisher=United States Senate}}</ref>\n\nThe Congress was created by the [[Constitution of the United States]] and first met in 1789, replacing in its legislative function the [[Congress of the Confederation]]. Although not legally mandated, in practice since the 19th century, Congress members are typically affiliated with the [[Republican party (United States)|Republican Party]] or with the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and only rarely with a [[Third-party members of the United States House of Representatives|third party]] or [[Independent (politician)|independents]].\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:The United States Legislative Process Overview (1) - Library of Congress.webm|thumb|left|Overview of the United States legislative process, as explained by the [[Library of Congress]]]]\n[[File:Johnson Impeachment Committee.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|alt=Seven men wearing suits posing for a group picture.|In 1868, this committee of representatives prosecuted President [[Andrew Johnson]] in his impeachment trial, but the Senate did not convict him.]]\n[[Article One of the United States Constitution]] states, \"All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.\" The House and Senate are equal partners in the legislative process\u2014legislation cannot be enacted without the consent of both chambers. However, the Constitution grants each chamber some unique powers.

Rehnquist|Chief Justice William Rehnquist]] presiding]]\n\nThe Constitution concentrates removal powers in the Congress by empowering and obligating the House of Representatives to [[Impeachment in the United States|impeach]] both executive and judicial officials for \"Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors\". Impeachment is a ''formal accusation'' of unlawful activity by a civil officer or government official. The Senate is constitutionally empowered and obligated to try all impeachments. A simple majority in the House is required to impeach an official; however, a two-thirds majority in the Senate is required for conviction. A convicted official is automatically removed from office; in addition, the Senate may stipulate that the [[defendant]] be banned from holding office in the future. Impeachment proceedings may not inflict more than this; however, a convicted party may face criminal penalties in a normal court of law. In the history of the United States, the House of Representatives has impeached sixteen officials, of whom seven were convicted. Another resigned before the Senate could complete the trial. Only three presidents have ever been impeached: [[Andrew Johnson]] in 1868, [[Bill Clinton]] in 1999, and [[Donald Trump]] in 2020.  All three [[trial (law)|trials]] ended in acquittal; in Johnson's case, the Senate fell one vote short of the two-thirds majority required for [[conviction (law)|conviction]]. In 1974, [[Richard Nixon]] resigned from office after impeachment proceedings in the [[House Judiciary Committee]] indicated he would eventually be removed from office.\n\nThe Senate has an important check on the executive power by confirming [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]] officials, judges, and other high officers \"by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate\". It confirms most presidential nominees but rejections are not uncommon. Furthermore, treaties negotiated by the President must be ratified by a two-thirds majority vote in the Senate to take effect. As a result, presidential arm-twisting of senators can happen before a key vote; for example, President Obama's secretary of state, [[Hillary Clinton]], urged her former senate colleagues to approve a nuclear arms treaty with Russia in 2010.<ref name=tws2010Sep11rr>{{cite news |author= Charles Wolfson |title= Clinton Presses Senate to Ratify Nuclear Arms Treaty with Russia\n|publisher= CBS News |date= August 11, 2010 |url= http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20013329-503544.html |accessdate=September 11, 2010}}</ref> The House of Representatives has no formal role in either the ratification of treaties or the appointment of federal officials, other than in [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution#Section 2: Vice Presidential vacancy|filling a vacancy]] in the office of the vice president; in such a case, a majority vote in each House is required to confirm a president's nomination of a vice president.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/>\n\nIn 1803, the Supreme Court established [[judicial review]] of federal legislation in ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'', holding, however, that Congress could not grant unconstitutional power to the Court itself. The Constitution does not explicitly state that the courts may exercise judicial review; however, the notion that courts could declare laws [[unconstitutional]] was envisioned by the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|founding fathers]]. [[Alexander Hamilton]], for example, mentioned and expounded upon the doctrine in [[Federalist No. 78]].

Some members of Congress are elected by their peers to be officers of these committees. Further, Congress has ancillary organizations such as the [[Government Accountability Office]] and the [[Library of Congress]] to help provide it with information, and members of Congress have staff and offices to assist them as well. In addition, a vast industry of lobbyists helps members write legislation on behalf of diverse corporate and labor interests.\n\n===Committees===\n[[File:The United States Legislative Process - Committee Consideration (3) - Library of Congress.webm|thumb|Library of Congress video explanation of committees in the United States Congress]] \n[[File:Congress Hall committee room 2.jpg|thumb|alt=Photo of a table with chairs.|Second committee room in [[Congress Hall]] in [[Philadelphia]]]]\n{{Main|United States congressional committee}}\n\n====Specializations====\nThe committee structure permits members of Congress to study a particular subject intensely. It is neither expected nor possible that a member be an expert on all subject areas before Congress.<ref name=\"english-46\">English (2003), pp. 46\u201347</ref> As time goes by, members develop expertise in particular subjects and their legal aspects.

While procedures, such as the House [[discharge petition]] process, can introduce bills to the House floor and effectively bypass committee input, yet they are exceedingly difficult to implement without committee action. Committees have power and have been called ''independent fiefdoms''. Legislative, oversight, and internal administrative tasks are divided among about two hundred committees and [[United States congressional subcommittee|subcommittees]] which gather information, evaluate alternatives, and identify problems.<ref name=\"House_Rules\"/> They propose solutions for consideration by the full chamber.<ref name=\"House_Rules\"/> In addition, they perform the function of ''oversight'' by monitoring the executive branch and investigating wrongdoing.<ref name=\"House_Rules\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20100423162313/http://www.rules.house.gov/archives/98-241.pdf Committee Types and Roles], [[Congressional Research Service]], April 1, 2003</ref>\n\n====Officer====\nAt the start of each two-year session the House elects a [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|speaker]] who does not normally preside over debates but serves as the majority party's leader. In the Senate, the vice president is the [[ex officio]] ''president'' of the Senate. In addition, the Senate elects an officer called the [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|president pro tempore]]. ''Pro tempore'' means ''for the time being'' and this office is usually held by the most senior member of the Senate's majority party and customarily keeps this position until there is a change in party control. Accordingly, the Senate does not necessarily elect a new president pro tempore at the beginning of a new Congress. In both the House and Senate, the actual presiding officer is generally a junior member of the majority party who is appointed so that new members become acquainted with the rules of the chamber.\n\n===Support services===\n====Library of Congress====\n[[File:Thomas Jefferson Building Aerial by Carol M. Highsmith.jpg|thumb|Library of Congress Jefferson Building]]\n{{Main|Library of Congress}}\nThe Library of Congress was established by an act of Congress in 1800. It is primarily housed in three buildings on [[Capitol Hill]], but also includes several other sites: the [[National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped]] in Washington, D.C.; the [[National Audio-Visual Conservation Center]] in Culpeper, Virginia; a large [[book storage]] facility located at Ft. Meade, Maryland; and multiple overseas offices. The Library had mostly law books when it was burned by a British raiding party during the [[War of 1812]], but the library's collections were restored and expanded when Congress authorized the purchase of [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s private library. One of the library's missions is to serve the Congress and its staff as well as the American public. It is the largest library in the world with nearly 150 million items including books, films, maps, photographs, music, manuscripts, graphics, and materials in 470 languages.<ref name=aboutLOC>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/about/generalinfo.html|title=General Information \u2013 Library of Congress|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n====Congressional Research Service====\n[[File:Congressional Research Service.svg|alt=|thumb]]\n{{Main|Congressional Research Service}}\nThe Congressional Research Service, part of the Library of Congress, provides detailed, up-to-date and non-partisan research for senators, representatives, and their staff to help them carry out their official duties.

[[Advocacy group|Lobby groups]] and their members sometimes write legislation and [[Whip (politics)|whip]] bills. In 2007, there were approximately 17,000 federal lobbyists in Washington, D.C.<ref>{{cite book |title=Washington Representatives|edition=32|date=November 2007|publisher=Columbia Books|location=Bethesda, MD|isbn=978-1-880873-55-7|page=949}}</ref> They explain to legislators the goals of their organizations.

The period after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] was marked by partisanship, as is the case today. It is generally easier for committees to reach accord on issues when compromise is possible. Some [[Political science|political scientists]] speculate that a prolonged period marked by narrow majorities in both chambers of Congress has intensified partisanship in the last few decades, but that an alternation of control of Congress between Democrats and Republicans may lead to greater flexibility in policies, as well as pragmatism and civility within the institution.<ref name=tws2010Sep11t14cc577>{{cite book |author1=Steven S.

A new session commences on January 3 each year, unless Congress decides differently. The Constitution requires Congress meet at least once each year and forbids either house from meeting outside the Capitol without the consent of the other house.\n\n===Joint sessions===\n{{Main|Joint session of the United States Congress}}\nJoint sessions of the United States Congress occur on special occasions that require a concurrent resolution from both House and Senate. These sessions include counting [[electoral votes]] after a presidential election and the president's [[State of the Union]] address. The [[State of the Union|constitutionally mandated report]], normally given as an annual speech, is modeled on Britain's [[Speech from the Throne]], was written by most presidents after [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]] but personally delivered as a spoken oration beginning with [[Woodrow Wilson|Wilson]] in 1913. Joint Sessions and Joint Meetings are traditionally presided over by the speaker of the House, except when counting presidential electoral votes when the vice president (acting as the president of the Senate) presides.\n\n===Bills and resolutions===\n{{See also|Act of Congress|List of United States federal legislation}}\n[[File:Private Law 86-407.jpg|An [[Act of Congress]] from 1960.|thumb]]\n[[File:US House Committee.jpg|thumb|right|The [[House Financial Services committee]] meets. Committee members sit in the tiers of raised chairs, while those testifying and audience members sit below.]]\n\nIdeas for legislation can come from members, lobbyists, state legislatures, constituents, legislative counsel, or executive agencies. Anyone can write a bill, but only members of Congress may introduce bills. Most bills are not written by Congress members, but originate from the Executive branch; interest groups often draft bills as well. The usual next step is for the proposal to be passed to a committee for review.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/> A proposal is usually in one of these forms:\n\n* '''Bills''' are laws in the making. A House-originated bill begins with the letters \"H.R.\" for \"House of Representatives\", followed by a number kept as it progresses.<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/>\n* '''Joint resolutions'''. There is little difference between a bill and a joint resolution since both are treated similarly; a joint resolution originating from the House, for example, begins \"H.J.Res.\" followed by its number.<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/>\n* '''Concurrent Resolutions''' affect only both the House and Senate and accordingly are not presented to the president for approval later. In the House, they begin with \"H.Con.Res.\"<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/>\n* '''Simple resolutions''' concern only the House or only the Senate and begin with \"H.Res.\" or \"S.Res.\"<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/>\n\nRepresentatives introduce a bill while the House is in session by placing it in the ''hopper'' on the Clerk's desk.<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> It is assigned a number and referred to a committee which studies each bill intensely at this stage.<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> Drafting statutes requires \"great skill, knowledge, and experience\" and sometimes take a year or more.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/> Sometimes lobbyists write legislation and submit it to a member for introduction. Joint resolutions are the normal way to propose a constitutional amendment or declare war. On the other hand, concurrent resolutions (passed by both houses) and simple resolutions (passed by only one house) do not have the force of law but express the opinion of Congress or regulate [[Parliamentary procedure|procedure]]. Bills may be introduced by any member of either house. However, the Constitution states, \"All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives.\" While the Senate cannot originate [[revenue]] and [[Appropriations bill (United States)|appropriation bills]], it has power to amend or reject them. Congress has sought ways to establish appropriate spending levels.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/>\n\nEach chamber determines its own internal rules of operation unless specified in the Constitution or prescribed by law. In the House, a [[U.S. House Committee on Rules|Rules Committee]] guides legislation; in the Senate, a [[Standing Rules of the Senate|Standing Rules]] committee is in charge. Each branch has its own traditions; for example, the Senate relies heavily on the practice of getting \"unanimous consent\" for noncontroversial matters.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/> House and Senate rules can be complex, sometimes requiring a hundred specific steps before a bill can become a law.<ref name=tws2010Sep11t14aa/> Members sometimes turn to outside experts to learn about proper Congressional procedures.<ref name=tws2010Sep11nn>{{cite news |author= Partnership for Public Service |title= Walter Oleszek: A Hill Staffer's Guide to Congressional History and Habit |newspaper= The Washington Post |date= March 29, 2009 |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/27/AR2009032701563.html |accessdate=September 11, 2010}}</ref>\n\nEach bill goes through several stages in each house including consideration by a committee and advice from the [[Government Accountability Office]].<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/> Most legislation is considered by [[standing committee]]s which have jurisdiction over a particular subject such as Agriculture or Appropriations. The House has twenty standing committees; the Senate has sixteen. Standing committees meet at least once each month.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/> Almost all standing committee meetings for transacting business must be open to the public unless the committee votes, publicly, to close the meeting.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/> A committee might call for public hearings on important bills.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/> Each committee is led by a [[chairperson|chair]] who belongs to the majority party and a [[ranking minority member|ranking member]] of the minority party. Witnesses and experts can present their case for or against a bill.<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> Then, a bill may go to what is called a ''mark-up'' session, where committee members debate the bill's merits and may offer amendments or revisions.<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> Committees may also amend the bill, but the full house holds the power to accept or reject committee amendments. After debate, the committee votes whether it wishes to report the measure to the full house. If a bill is ''tabled'' then it is rejected. If amendments are extensive, sometimes a new bill with amendments built in will be submitted as a so-called ''clean bill'' with a new number.<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> Both houses have procedures under which committees can be bypassed or overruled but they are rarely used. Generally, members who have been in Congress longer have greater seniority and therefore greater power.<ref name=tws2010Sep11qq/>\n\nA bill which reaches the floor of the full house can be simple or complex<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> and begins with an [[enacting formula]] such as \"Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled.\" Consideration of a bill requires, itself, a ''rule'' which is a simple resolution specifying the particulars of debate\u2014time limits, possibility of further amendments, and such.<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> Each side has equal time and members can yield to other members who wish to speak.<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> Sometimes opponents seek to ''recommit'' a bill which means to change part of it.<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> Generally, discussion requires a ''quorum'', usually half of the total number of representatives, before discussion can begin, although there are exceptions.<ref name=tws2010Sep11mm>{{cite news |title= News from Washington |newspaper= The New York Times |date= December 3, 1861 |url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30611FA38541A7493C1A91789D95F458684F9 |archive-url= https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20171010131909/http://www.nytimes.com/1861/12/03/news/washington-meeting-thirty-seventh-congress-quorum-present-both-houses-business.html |url-status = dead|archive-date= October 10, 2017 |accessdate= September 11, 2010 }}</ref> The house may debate and amend the bill; the precise procedures used by the House and Senate differ.

For the bill to become law, both houses must agree to identical versions of the bill.<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> If the second house amends the bill, then the differences between the two versions must be reconciled in a [[United States congressional conference committee|conference committee]], an ''ad hoc'' committee that includes both senators and representatives<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> sometimes by using a ''reconciliation process'' to limit budget bills.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/> Both houses use a budget enforcement mechanism informally known as ''pay-as-you-go'' or ''paygo'' which discourages members from considering acts which increase budget deficits.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/> If both houses agree to the version reported by the conference committee, the bill passes, otherwise it fails.\n\nThe Constitution specifies that a majority of members, known as a ''[[quorum]],'' be present before doing business in each house. However, the rules of each house assume that a quorum is present unless a [[quorum call]] demonstrates the contrary and debate often continues despite the lack of a majority.\n\nVoting within Congress can take many forms, including systems using lights and bells and electronic voting.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/> Both houses use voice voting to decide most matters in which members shout \"aye\" or \"no\" and the presiding officer announces the result. The Constitution, however, requires a [[Voting methods in deliberative assemblies|recorded vote]] if demanded by one-fifth of the members present or when voting to override a presidential veto. If the voice vote is unclear or if the matter is controversial, a recorded vote usually happens. The Senate uses [[Voting methods in deliberative assemblies|roll-call voting]], in which a clerk calls out the names of all the senators, each senator stating \"aye\" or \"no\" when their name is announced. In the Senate, the Vice President may cast the tie-breaking vote if present when the Senators are equally divided.\n\nThe House reserves roll-call votes for the most formal matters, as a roll call of all 435 representatives takes quite some time; normally, members vote by using an electronic device. In the case of a tie, the motion in question fails. Most votes in the House are done electronically, allowing members to vote ''yea'' or ''nay'' or ''present'' or ''open''.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/> Members insert a voting ''ID card'' and can change their votes during the last five minutes if they choose; in addition, paper ballots are used on some occasions\u2014''yea'' indicated by green and ''nay'' by red.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/> One member cannot cast a [[proxy vote]] for another.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/> Congressional votes are recorded on an online database.<ref name=tws2010Sep11gg>{{cite news |author= United States government |title= Recent Votes |publisher= United States Senate |year= 2010 |url= https://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/legislative/a_three_sections_with_teasers/votes.htm |accessdate=September 11, 2010}}</ref><ref name=tws2010Sep11t7>{{cite news|title=The U.S. Congress \u2013 Votes Database \u2013 Members of Congress / Robert Byrd |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=June 17, 2010 |url=http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/k000105/ |accessdate=September 11, 2010 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101110035120/http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/k000105/ |archivedate=November 10, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nAfter passage by both houses, a bill is [[Enrolled bill|enrolled]] and sent to the president for approval.<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> The president may sign it making it law or veto it, perhaps returning it to Congress with the president's objections.

Legislators who \"burnish a reputation for policy expertise and leadership\".\n# '''''Power in the chamber.'''''

This constitutionally derived immunity applies to members during sessions and when traveling to and from sessions.<ref>Davidson (2006), p. 17</ref> The term ''arrest'' has been interpreted broadly, and includes any detention or delay in the course of [[Police|law enforcement]], including [[Summons|court summons]] and [[subpoena]]s. The rules of the House strictly guard this privilege; a member may not waive the privilege on their own, but must seek the permission of the whole house to do so. Senate rules, however, are less strict and permit individual senators to waive the privilege as they choose.\n\nThe Constitution guarantees absolute freedom of debate in both houses, providing in the [[Speech or Debate Clause]] of the Constitution that \"for any Speech or Debate in either House, they shall not be questioned in any other Place\". Accordingly, a member of Congress may not be sued in court for [[slander]] because of remarks made in either house, although each house has its own rules restricting offensive speeches, and may punish members who transgress.\n\nObstructing the work of Congress is a crime under [[federal law]] and is known as [[contempt of Congress]]. Each member has the power to cite individuals for contempt but can only issue a contempt citation\u2014the judicial system pursues the matter like a normal criminal case. If convicted in court, an individual found guilty of contempt of Congress may be imprisoned for up to one year.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nThe [[franking]] privilege allows members of Congress to send official mail to constituents at government expense.
