During prewar and early war field exercises, it was found that the M1 Garand impeded these soldiers' mobility, as a slung rifle would frequently catch on brush, bang the helmet and tilt it over the eyes. Many soldiers found the rifle slid off the shoulder unless slung diagonally across the back, where it prevented the wearing of standard field packs and haversacks.\n\nAdditionally, Germany's use of glider-borne and paratroop forces to launch surprise \u2018blitzkrieg\u2019 attacks behind the front lines generated a request for a new compact infantry weapon to equip support troops.<ref name=\"George, John 1981 p. 394\"/><ref name=\"Weeks\">{{cite book|author1=Weeks, John S.|title=World War II Small Arms|url=https://archive.org/details/worldwariismalla0000week|url-access=registration|publisher=Chartwell House|isbn=978-0-88365-403-3|date=1 May 1989|page=[https://archive.org/details/worldwariismalla0000week/page/130 130]|archiveurl= |archivedate= }}</ref> This request called for a compact, lightweight defensive weapon with greater range, accuracy and firepower than handguns, while weighing half as much as the [[Thompson submachine gun]] or the [[M1 rifle]].<ref name=\"George, John 1981 p. 394\">{{cite book |author1=George, John|title=Shots Fired In Anger |edition=2nd Revised & Enlarged |location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=National Rifle Association of America|isbn=978-0935998429 |date=1981|page=394}}</ref> The U.S. Army decided that a carbine would adequately fulfill all of these requirements, but specified that the new arm should weigh no more than five pounds and have an effective range of 300 yards.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ozvYaxr6iQ|title=M1 Carbine at 300 Yards|first=|last= |date=2 October 2012|website=YouTube|format=Video}}</ref><ref name=\"Ruth\">{{cite book |author1=Ruth, Larry L.|title=M1 Carbine: Design, Development & Production|publisher=The Gun Room Press|url=https://www.abebooks.com/M1-CARBINE-DESIGN-DEVELOPMENT-PRODUCTION-Ruth/22379562692/bd |date=1988 |isbn=0-88227-020-6|quote=contains many Ordnance documents related to the \"Light Rifle\" specification that led to the M1 carbine}}</ref> Paratroopers were also added to the list of intended users and a folding-stock version would also be developed.\n\n===Designing the M1 carbine===\nIn 1938, the Chief of Infantry requested that the Ordnance Department develop a \"light rifle\" or carbine, though the formal requirement for the weapon type was not approved until 1940. This led to a competition in 1941 by major U.S. firearm companies and designers.\n\n[[Winchester Repeating Arms Company|Winchester]] at first did not submit a carbine design, as it was occupied in developing the .30-06 Winchester M2 military rifle. The rifle originated as a design by Jonathan \"Ed\" Browning, brother of the famous firearm designer [[John Browning]]. A couple of months after Ed Browning's death in May 1939, Winchester hired [[David Marshall Williams|David Marshall \"Carbine\" Williams]] who had begun work on a [[Gas-operated reloading#Short-stroke piston|short-stroke gas piston]] design while serving a prison sentence at a North Carolina minimum-security work farm. Winchester, after Williams' release, had hired Williams on the strength of recommendations of firearms industry leaders and hoped Williams would be able to complete various designs left unfinished by Ed Browning, including the Winchester .30-06 M2 rifle. Williams incorporated his short-stroke piston in the existing design. After the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] semi-automatic rifle trials in 1940, Browning's rear-locking tilting bolt design proved unreliable in sandy conditions. As a result, the rifle was redesigned to incorporate a Garand-style [[rotating bolt]] and operating rod, retaining Williams' short-stroke piston. By May 1941, Williams had shaved the M2 rifle prototype from about {{convert|9.5|lb|abbr=on}} to a mere {{convert|7.5|lb|abbr=on}}.\n\nOrdnance found unsatisfactory the first series of prototype carbines submitted by several firearms companies and some independent designers.<ref name=\"Ruth\"/>  Winchester had contacted the Ordnance Corps to examine their rifle M2 design. Major Ren\u00e9 Studler of Ordnance believed the rifle design could be scaled down to a carbine which would weigh 4.5 to 4.75&nbsp;lb {{nowrap|(2.0\u20132.2 kg)}} and demanded a prototype as soon as possible. The first model was developed at Winchester in 13 days by William C. Roemer, Fred Humeston and three other Winchester engineers under supervision of Edwin Pugsley, and was essentially Williams' last version of the .30-06 M2 scaled down to the .30 SL cartridge.<ref name=\"Canfield, Bruce N. 2009\">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.americanrifleman.org/articles/2016/4/7/carbine-williams-myth-reality/|author1=Canfield, Bruce N.|title='Carbine' Williams: Myth & Reality|magazine=The American Rifleman|publisher=NRA Publications|date=7 April 2016 |format=February 2009 Reprint}}</ref> This patchwork prototype was cobbled together using the trigger housing and lockwork of a Winchester M1905 rifle and a modified Garand operating rod.

Williams participated in the finishing of this prototype. The second prototype competed successfully against all remaining carbine candidates in September 1941, and Winchester was notified of their success the very next month. Standardization as the M1 carbine was approved on October 22, 1941.  This story was the loose basis for the 1952 movie ''[[Carbine Williams]]'' starring [[James Stewart]]. Contrary to the movie, Williams had little to do with the carbine's development, with the exception of his short-stroke gas piston design. Williams worked on his own design apart from the other Winchester staff, but it was not ready for testing until December 1941, two months after the Winchester M1 carbine had been adopted and type-classified. Winchester supervisor Edwin Pugsley conceded that Williams' final design was \"an advance on the one that was accepted\", but noted that Williams' decision to go it alone was a distinct impediment to the project,<ref name=\"Canfield, Bruce N. 2009\"/> and Williams' additional design features were not incorporated into M1 production. In a 1951 memo written in fear of a patent infringement lawsuit by Williams, Winchester noted his patent for the short-stroke piston may have been improperly granted as a previous patent covering the same principle of operation was overlooked by the patent office.<ref name=\"Canfield, Bruce N. 2009\"/>\n\nIn 1973 the senior technical editor at the NRA contacted Edwin Pugsley for \"a technical last testament\" on M1 carbine history shortly before his death 19 Nov 1975. According to Pugsley, \"The carbine was invented by no single man,\" but was the result of a team effort including Bill Roemer, Marsh Williams, Fred Humeston, Cliff Warner, at least three other Winchester engineers, and Pugsley himself. Ideas were taken and modified from the Winchester M2 Browning rifle (Williams' gas system), the [[Winchester Model 1905]] rifle (fire control group and magazine), M1 Garand (buttstock dimensions, and bolt and operating slide principles), and a percussion shotgun in Pugsley's collection (hook breech and barrel band assembly/disassembly).<ref>E.H.

As a result, the .30 carbine cartridge is approximately 27% more powerful than its parent cartridge. A standard .30 carbine ball bullet weighs 110 grains (7.1&nbsp;g), a complete loaded round weighs 195 grains (12.6&nbsp;g) and has a muzzle velocity of 1,990&nbsp;ft/s (610&nbsp;m/s) giving it 967&nbsp;ft\u00b7lbf (1,311 joules) of energy, when fired from the M1 carbine's 18\" barrel.\n\nBy comparison, the [[.30-06]] [[M1 Garand]] is almost 3 times more powerful than the M1 carbine. However, the carbine is twice as powerful as the [[.45ACP]] caliber submachine guns in common use at the time. As a result, the carbine offers much better range, accuracy and penetration than those submachine guns.<ref name=\"George, John 1981 p. 394\"/> The M1 is also half the weight of a [[Thompson submachine gun]] and fires a lighter cartridge. Therefore, soldiers armed with the carbine can carry much more ammunition than those armed with a Tommy gun.\n\nCategorizing the M1 carbine series has been the subject of much debate. Although commonly compared to the later German [[Sturmgewehr 44|StG44]] and Russian [[AK-47]], the M1 and M2 carbines are under-powered and outclassed by comparison.<ref name=\"Rottman_Green\"/> The carbine instead falls somewhere between the submachine gun and the assault rifle, and could be called a precursor of the [[personal defense weapon]] since it fulfilled a similar role.\n\nOne characteristic of .30 caliber carbine ammunition is that from the beginning of production, [[Centerfire ammunition#Centerfire primers|non-corrosive primers]] were specified. This was the first major use of this type of primer in a military firearm.  Because the rifle had a closed gas system, not normally disassembled, corrosive primers would have led to a rapid deterioration of the gas system.<ref name=\"The_AmericanRifleman_to_War\">{{cite book |last1=Roberts |first1=Joseph B. |title=The American rifleman goes to war: The guns, troops, and training of World War II as reported in NRA's magazine |date=1992 |publisher=National Rifle Association of America |page=20 |edition=First |isbn=0935998632 }}</ref>  The use of non-corrosive primers was a novelty in service ammunition at this time.<ref name=\"Dunlap\">{{cite book |author1=Dunlap, Roy F. |title=Ordnance Went Up Front|publisher=R&R Books |date=1993 |pages=240,293\u2013297|edition=1st|url=https://www.abebooks.com/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=30503157727&tab=1&searchurl=sortby%3D17%26tn%3Dordnance%2Bwent%2Bup%2Bfront&cm_sp=snippet-_-srp1-_-seller6}}</ref>  Some failures to fire were reported in early lots of .30 caliber carbine ammunition, attributed to moisture ingress of the non-corrosive primer compound.<ref name=\"Shore, C. 1988 pp. 191-195\"/>\n\n===Sights, range & accuracy===\nThe M1 carbine entered service with a simple flip sight, which had two settings: 150 and 300 yards.<ref name=\"FM23-7\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/ref/FM/PDFs/FM23-7.PDF|title=BASIC FIELD MANUAL - U.S. CARBINE, CALIBER .30, Ml|date=20 May 1942|publisher=War Department |format=FM 23-7}}</ref> However, field reports indicated that this sight was inadequate, and in 1944, it was replaced by a sliding ramp-type adjustable sight with four settings: 100, 200, 250 and 300 yards.<ref name=\"Leroy_M1\"/> This new rear sight was also adjustable for windage.\n\nAt {{convert|100|yd}}, the M1 carbine can deliver groups between 3 and 5 inches, sufficient for its intended purpose as a close-range defensive weapon.

This field adaptation was never officially approved, but proved an efficient method to supply extra ammunition in combat.  After the introduction of the 30-round magazine, it was common for troops to tape two 30-round magazines together, a practice that became known as \"[[Jungle style (firearm magazines)|Jungle style]]\". This led the military to introduce the \"Holder, Magazine T3-A1\" also called the \"Jungle Clip\", a metal clamp that held two magazines together without the need for tape.\n\nThe 30-round magazines introduced for use with the selective-fire M2 carbine would not be reliably retained by the magazine catch made for the original M1 carbine which was designed to retain a 15-round magazine, so the much heavier (when loaded) 30-round magazine would not be properly seated in the M1 carbine magazine well. The loaded 30-round magazine would typically cant (impairing feed reliability) or even fall out, which helps explain why the 30-round magazines have a poor reliability record (they are also more prone to damage due to their added length and weight when loaded as thin steel is used to make them). Thus early production M1 carbines must be fitted with the type IV magazine catch used on the M2 carbine (and late production M1 carbines) if they are to be used with 30-round magazines. The type IV magazine catch will have a leg on the left side to correspond with the additional nub on the 30-round magazines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forums.thecmp.org/showthread.php?t=5377 |title=Carbine magazine catches |publisher=Civilian Marksmanship Program|date=January 2010 |accessdate=10 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nInitial combat reports noted that M1 carbine's magazine release button was often mistaken for the safety button while under fire.<ref name=\"Leroy_M1\"/>  When this occurred, pressing the mag release caused the loaded magazine to drop into the dirt, while the safety remained in the off position. As a result, the push-button safety was redesigned using a rotating lever.<ref name=\"Leroy_M1\"/><ref name=\"M1_Warrior\">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.gunsandammo.com/blogs/history-books/m1-carbine-americas-unlikely-warrior/|magazine=Guns & Ammo|title=M1 Carbine: America's Unlikely Warrior|author1=James, Garry|date=6 October 2014|quote=The M1 carbine (M1A1 shown) was one of America's most widely used arms in three major conflicts and a popular lend/lease item to Allied countries.}}</ref>\n\n===Accessories===\nOriginally the M1 carbine did not have a bayonet lug, but it was often issued with an [[M3 fighting knife]] or a bayonet converted into a fighting knife. Due to requests from the field, the carbine was modified to incorporate a bayonet lug attached to the barrel band starting in 1945.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rjmilitaria.com/m1carbineb.htm|title= Collecting The M1 carbine|publisher=RJ Militaria|accessdate=29 October 2015}}</ref> However, very few carbines with bayonet lugs reached the front lines before the end of World War II. After the war, the bayonet lug was added to many M1 carbines during the arsenal refurbishing process. By the start of the [[Korean War]], the bayonet lug-equipped M1 was standard issue. It is now rare to find an original M1 carbine without the bayonet lug. The M1 carbine mounts the standard [[M4 bayonet]], which was based on the earlier [[M3 fighting knife]] and formed the basis for the later [[M5 bayonet|M5]], [[M6 bayonet|M6]] and [[M7 bayonet]]-knives.\n\nA folding-stock version of the carbine (the M1A1) was also developed after a request for a compact and light infantry arm for airborne troops. The Inland Division of General Motors manufactured 140,000 of them in two product runs in late 1942.<ref name=\"rjmilitaria.com\"/> They were originally issued to the 82nd and 101st Airborne divisions but were later issued to all U.S. Army airborne units and the  U.S. Marine Corps.<ref name=\"rjmilitaria.com\"/>  The folding-stock M1A1 is an unusual design in that the stock is not locked in the open or closed position, but is instead held in place by a spring-loaded cam.\n\nAs carbines were reconditioned, parts such as the magazine catch, rear sight, barrel band without bayonet lug, and stock were upgraded with current standard-issue parts. Also, both during and after World War II, many semi-automatic M1 carbines were converted to select-fire M2 carbines by using the T17 and T18 conversion kits.<ref name=\"Firearm_ID\">{{cite book |title=Cartridges and Firearm Identification |author1=Walker, Robert E.|publisher=CRC Press|edition=1st |page= 254|isbn=978-1466502062|date=2012-11-26}}</ref> The conversion included a modified sear, slide, and trigger housing, and added a disconnector, disconnector lever, and selector switch that could be set for semi-auto or full-automatic fire.\n\nDuring World War II, the T23 (M3) [[Flash suppressor|flash hider]] was designed to reduce the muzzle flash from the carbine, but was not introduced into service until the advent of the M3 carbine.<ref name=\"Ruth, Larry L. 1992 pp. 621-623\">{{cite book |author1=Ruth, Larry L. |title=War Baby: The U.S. Caliber .30 Carbine, Vol. 1|publisher=Collector Grade Publications |isbn=978-0-88935-117-2 |edition=1st Limited|date=1992|pages= 621\u2013623}}</ref>  With the exception of T23 hiders mounted on M3 carbines, few if any T23 flash-hider attachments saw service during the war, though unit armorers occasionally hand-built improvised compensator/flash-hiders of their own design.<ref name=\"Ruth, Larry L. 1992 pp. 621-623\"/><ref name=\"Dunlap\"/>\n\nThe M1 carbine was used with the [[M8 grenade launcher]], which was developed in early 1944. It was fired with the .30 caliber carbine M6 Grenade Blank cartridge to launch [[22 mm grenade|22 mm rifle grenades]]. Stress from firing rifle grenades would eventually crack the carbine's stock. It also could not use the M8 launcher with an M7 auxiliary \"booster\" charge (to extend its range) without breaking the stock. This made it a type of emergency-issue weapon.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Battle of the Bulge.jpg|thumb|American infantrymen of the 290th Regiment fight in fresh snowfall near Amonines, Belgium.

Despite being designed by Winchester, the great majority of these were made by other companies (see [[M1_carbine#Military contractors|\u00a7 Military contractors]] below). The largest producer was the Inland division of [[General Motors]], but many others were made by contractors as diverse as [[IBM]], the Underwood Typewriter Company, and [[Rock-Ola|Rock-Ola Manufacturing Corporation]]. Few contractors made all the parts for carbines bearing their names: some makers bought parts from other major contractors or sub-contracted minor parts to companies like Marlin Firearms or Auto-Ordnance. Parts by all makers were required to be interchangeable. Often one company would get ahead or behind in production and parts would be shipped from one company to the other to help them catch up on their quota.  When receivers were shipped for this purpose the manufacturers would often mark them for both companies.  Some of the strangest combinations were the M1's made by the combined efforts of Underwood and Quality Hardware, resulting in the manufacturer mark UN-QUALITY.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cmpauction.thecmp.org/uploaded/2013-1-21/c912644d2Dfc9b2D418d2Db7d72D5741cbccf5e6DSC5F0020.JPG|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111230959/http://cmpauction.thecmp.org/uploaded/2013-1-21/c912644d2Dfc9b2D418d2Db7d72D5741cbccf5e6DSC5F0020.JPG|url-status=dead|archivedate=11 November 2013|title=UN-QUALITY Stamp|date=11 November 2013|format=Photo}}</ref> The receiver was subcontracted from Union Switch and Signal, not Underwood.

At the beginning of World War II the average production cost for an M1 carbine was approximately $45, about half the cost of an M1 rifle at approximately $85 and about a fifth of the cost of a [[Thompson submachine gun]] at approximately $225. The .30 Caliber carbine ammunition was also far cheaper to produce than the standard .30-06 ammunition; used fewer resources, was smaller, lighter, faster and easier to make. These were major factors in the United States military decision to adopt the M1 carbine, especially when considering the vast numbers of weapons and ammunition manufactured and transported by the United States during World War II.\n\n==U.S. combat use==\n===World War II===\n\n[[File:USMC M1 Carbine.JPEG|thumb|U.S. Marine in combat at Guam.]]\n[[File:First Iwo Jima Flag Raising.jpg|thumb|M1 carbine at first Iwo Jima flag raising.]]\n\nThe M1 carbine with its reduced-power .30 cartridge was not originally intended to serve as a primary weapon for combat infantrymen, nor was it comparable to more powerful assault rifles developed late in the war. However, it was markedly superior to the .45 caliber submachineguns in use at the time in both accuracy and penetration,<ref name=\"George, John 1981 p. 394\"/> and its lighter .30 caliber cartridge allowed soldiers to carry more ammunition.

September 20, 1950. The M1 carbine in the foreground has the bayonet mounted.]]\nInitially, the M1 carbine was intended to have a [[selective-fire|select-fire]] capability, but the requirement for rapid production of the new carbine resulted in the omission of this feature from the Light Rifle Program. On 26 October 1944, in response to the Germans' widespread use of automatic weapons, especially the [[Sturmgewehr 44]] [[assault rifle]], the select-fire '''M2 carbine''' was introduced, along with a new 30-round magazine. The M2 had a fully automatic rate-of-fire of about 850\u2013900 rounds-per-minute. Although actual M2 production began late in the war (April 1945), U.S. Ordnance issued conversion-part kits to allow field conversion of semi-auto M1 carbines to the selective-fire M2 configuration. These converted M1/M2 select-fire carbines saw limited combat service in Europe, primarily during the final Allied advance into Germany. In the Pacific, both converted and original M2 carbines saw limited use in the last days of the fighting in the Philippines.<ref name=\"Dunlap\"/>\n\n====Infrared sight versions====\nThe '''M3 carbine''' was an M2 carbine  with the M2 infrared night sight or ''[[Sniperscope#Generation 0|sniperscope]]''.<ref name=\"Century 2000. page 290\"/> The M3 did not have [[iron sights]].<ref name=\"Century 2000. page 290\"/> It was first used in combat by Army units during the [[Battle of Okinawa|invasion of Okinawa]], about 150 M3 carbines were used on Okinawa. For the first time, U.S. soldiers had a weapon that allowed them to visually detect Japanese infiltrating into American lines at night, even during complete darkness. A team of two or three soldiers was used to operate the weapon and provide support.<ref name=\"Rush_GI\"/>  At night, the scope would be used to detect Japanese patrols and assault units moving forward.  At that point, the operator would fire a burst of automatic fire at the greenish images of enemy soldiers.<ref name=\"Rush_GI\"/>  The M3 carbine had an effective range of about 70 yards (64 meters), limited by the visual capabilities of the sight.<ref name=\"Article\">{{cite web |title=M3 Infra Red Night Sight |url=http://www.rt66.com/~korteng/SmallArms/m3irsnip.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005050126/http://www.rt66.com/~korteng/SmallArms/m3irsnip.htm |archivedate=2008-10-05|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Fog and rain further reduced the weapon's effective range.<ref name=\"Rush_GI\"/><ref name=\"Article\"/> However, it is estimated that fully 30% of Japanese casualties inflicted by rifle and carbine fire during the Okinawan campaign were caused by the M3 carbine.<ref name=\"Rush_GI\"/>\n\nThe system was refined over time, and by the Korean War the improved M3 infrared night sight was in service. The M3 sight has a longer effective range than its predecessor, about 125 yards (114 meters). However, it still required the user to carry a heavy backpack-mounted battery pack to power the scope and infrared light. They were used primarily in static defensive positions in Korea to locate troops attempting to infiltrate in darkness. M3 operators would not only use their carbines to dispatch individual targets, but also used tracer ammo to identify troop concentrations for machine gunners to decimate.<ref name=\"Leroy_M1\"/> In total, about 20,000 sets were made before they became obsolete, and were surplussed to the public.\n\n===Korean War===\n[[File:Korean War HA-SN-98-07010.jpg|thumb|right| M1 carbine in action during Korean War.

Certain provincial police units of the Philippine National Police (PNP) still use government-issue M1 carbines as well as some operating units of the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI). In many provinces of the Philippines, M1 carbines are still highly valued as a light small arm. Elements of the New People's Army and Islamic Secessionist movement value the carbine as a lightweight weapon and preferred choice for mountain and ambush operations.\n\nThe M1 carbine has become one of the most recognized firearms in Philippine society, with the Marikina City-based company ARMSCOR Philippines still continuing to manufacture .30 caliber ammunition for the Philippine market.\n\n=== Latin America ===\nThe M1 and M2 carbines were widely used by military, police, and security forces and their opponents during the many guerrilla and civil wars throughout [[Latin America]] until the 1990s, when they were mostly replaced by more modern designs.

Fully automatic capability was incorporated into the design of the M2 (an improved, selective-fire version of the M1), introduced in 1944.  The M2 featured the late M1 improvements to the rear sight, addition of a bayonet lug, and other minor changes.\n\nResearch into a conversion kit for selective fire began May 1944; the first kit was developed by Inland engineers, and known as the T4. Inland was awarded a contract for 500 T4 carbines in September 1944. Although the conversion was seen as satisfactory, the heavier 30-round magazine\nput greater strain on the magazine catch, necessitating the development of a sturdier catch. The slide, sear, and stock design also had to be modified. On fully automatic fire, the T4 model could fire about 750 rounds per minute, but generated a manageable recoil.<ref name=\"Leroy_M1\"/>\n\nAlthough some carbines were marked at the factory as M2, the only significant difference between an M1 and M2 carbine is in the fire control group. The military issued field conversion kits (T17 and T18) to convert an M1 to an M2. Legally a carbine marked M2 is always a machine gun for [[National Firearms Act of 1934|national firearms registry]] purposes.\n\nThese M2 parts including the heavier M2 stock were standardized for arsenal rebuild of M1 and M1A1 carbines.\n\nA modified round bolt replaced the original flat top bolt to save machining steps in manufacture.  Many sources erroneously refer to this round bolt as an 'M2 bolt' but it was developed as a standard part for new manufacture M1 and later M2 carbines and as a replacement part, with priority given to use on M1A1 and M2 carbines.<ref name=\"Ruth\"/> The slightly heavier round bolt did moderate the cyclic rate of the M2 on full automatic.<ref name=\"Small_Arms\">{{cite book |author1=Smith, W.H.B. |title=Small Arms of the World|publisher=Stackpole |date=May 1990|edition=12th|isbn=978-0880296014|quote=illustrates an M2 carbine in an M1A1 stock on p.642 and a parts breakdown of the M2 on p.646 is shown with a flat top bolt}}</ref>\n\nDespite being in demand, very few M2 carbines saw use during World War II, and then mostly in the closing days against Japan.<ref name=\"Leroy_M1\"/> The M2 carbine was logistically compatible with the millions of M1 carbines in U.S. service, and offered longer range, better accuracy and better penetration than (pistol caliber) [[submachine gun]]s like the [[M1 Thompson submachine gun|M1 Thompsons]] and [[M3 submachine gun|M3 Grease Guns]].<ref>America's Favorite Gun. by Gold V. Sanders. Popular Science Aug 1944. pp. 84\u201387, 221</ref> Therefore, after World War II, the M2 carbine largely replaced the submachine-guns in U.S. service, until it was itself replaced by the M16 rifle.<ref name=\"The M16 2011. page 6\"/>\n\nThe M2 model was the most widely used Carbine variant during the [[Korean War]].<ref name=\"Leroy_M1\"/> A detailed study of the effectiveness of the M2 in the war was assembled by [[S. L. A. Marshall]]. He found that many troops complained on the lack of effective range of the gun, which allowed the enemy to get close enough to throw [[hand grenade]]s. A more detailed analysis showed however that most troops who complained actually tended to run low on ammo, because they fired their M2 on fully automatic too soon. Troops who fired their guns on semi-automatic at distance generally complained less about the M2's effectiveness. Generally, the more seasoned troops used the latter approach. The carbine was usually given to second line troops (administrative, support, etc.), who had little combat experience and also did not have much training in [[small unit tactics|small-unit tactics]], but who usually had to engage the enemy at some critical moment, like a breakthrough or ambush. Marshall noted that almost all killing shots with carbines in Korea were at ranges of 50 yards or less. It was unsurprising therefore that the M2 was a preferred weapon for [[night combat|night patrols]]. The M2 was also used in the early stages of the [[Vietnam War]] by special forces, [[ARVN]] advisers, and air crews.<ref name=\"Leroy_M1\"/>\n\nContemporary authors have struggled to categorize the M2 carbine. On one hand, it is more powerful than a submachine gun and is considered by some to be an [[assault rifle]], even though it fires a projectile considerably less powerful than the [[StG 44]]'s [[7.92\u00d733mm Kurz]]. On the other hand, the M2 can also be considered a precursor of the modern [[personal defense weapon]] (PDW) concept, even though contemporary guns in that category, like the [[FN P90]], fire substantially different cartridges like the [[5.7\u00d728mm]].<ref name=\"Leroy_M1\"/>\n\n===Carbine, Cal. 30, M2A2===\n* Arsenal-refurbished (overstamped M2) model\n\n===Carbine, Cal .30, M3===\n* M2 with mounting (T3 mount) for an early active (infrared) night vision sight\n* About 3,000 produced\n* Three versions of night sight (M1, M2, M3)\n\n[[File:M3 Sniperscope.jpg|thumb|right|Original Korean War era USMC M3 Night Vision Scope]]\n\nThe M3 carbine was an M2 carbine fitted with a mount designed to accept an infrared sight for use at night.  It was initially used with the M1 [[Image intensifier#Generation 0|sniperscope]], and an active [[infrared]] sight, and saw action in 1945 with the Army during the invasion of Okinawa.  Before the M3 carbine and M1 sniperscope were type-classified, they were known as the T3 and T120, respectively. The system continued to be developed, and by the time of the [[Korean War]], the M3 carbine was used with the M3 sniperscope.\n\nThe M2 sniper scope extended the effective nighttime range of the M3 carbine to 100 yards.  In the later stages of the Korean War, an improved version of the M3 carbine, with a revised mount, a forward pistol grip, and a new M3 sniperscope design was used in the latter stages of Korea and briefly in Vietnam.  The M3 sniperscope had a large active infrared spotlight mounted on top of the scope body itself, allowing use in the prone position. The revised M3/M3 had an effective range of around 125 yards.<ref name=\"Article\"/> Eventually, the M3 carbine and its M3 sniperscope would be superseded by passive-design night vision scopes with extended visible ranges; the improved scopes in turn required the use of rifle-caliber weapons with flatter trajectories and increased hit probability.\n\n==Derivatives==\n===Ingram SAM===\n\nThe [[Military Armament Corporation|Ingram]] SAM rifles are M1 carbine derivatives in [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]] (SAM-1), [[7.62\u00d739mm]] (SAM-2) and [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]] (SAM-3). The 5.56\u00d745mm versions accept M16 magazines, the 7.62\u00d739mm accept AK magazines and the 7.62\u00d751mm versions use FN FAL magazines. They did not catch on in competition against the Ruger Mini-14 in both the police and civilian markets.

The new Inland M1 carbines feature many of the same characteristics of the original Inland Carbines and are manufactured in the USA.  The M1 carbine is modeled after the last production model that Inland manufactured in 1945 and features a type 3 bayonet lug / barrel band, adjustable rear sights, push button safety, round bolt, and \"low wood\" walnut stock, and a 15-round magazine.  A 30-round mag catch was utilized to allow high-capacity magazines. A \"1944\" M1 Carbine is also available that has the same features as the 1945 only with a Type 2 barrel Band and 10-round magazine and is available for sale in most states with magazine capacity & bayonet lug restrictions. The M1A1 is modeled after a late production 1944 M1A1 Paratrooper model with a folding \"low wood\" walnut stock, Type two barrel band, and includes the same adjustable sights which were actually introduced in 1944.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tactical-life.com/firearms/inland-manufacturing-m1-carbines|title=Inland Manufacturing Releases 'American Classic' M1 Carbines|author=Robert A.

Although not banned by name, make or model, M1 Carbines may in some cases be classified as contraband assault weapon under the 2013 NY SAFE act if they feature bayonet lugs, pistol grips, folding stocks and flash suppressors. 10-round magazines are available in states that restrict magazine capacity for civilian firearms.\n\nThe M1 carbine was also used by various law enforcement agencies and prison guards, and was prominently carried by riot police during the civil unrest of the late 1960s and early 1970s; until it was replaced in those roles by more modern .223 caliber semi-automatic rifles such as the [[Ruger Mini-14]] and the [[Colt AR-15]] type rifles in the late 1970s and early 1980s.\n\nThe ease of use and great adaptability of the weapon led to it being used by [[Malcolm X]] and [[Patty Hearst]].

During prewar and early war field exercises, it was found that the M1 Garand impeded these soldiers' mobility, as a slung rifle would frequently catch on brush, bang the helmet and tilt it over the eyes. Many soldiers found the rifle slid off the shoulder unless slung diagonally across the back, where it prevented the wearing of standard field packs and haversacks.\n\nAdditionally, Germany's use of glider-borne and paratroop forces to launch surprise \u2018blitzkrieg\u2019 attacks behind the front lines generated a request for a new compact infantry weapon to equip support troops.<ref name=\"George, John 1981 p. 394\"/><ref name=\"Weeks\">{{cite book|author1=Weeks, John S.|title=World War II Small Arms|url=https://archive.org/details/worldwariismalla0000week|url-access=registration|publisher=Chartwell House|isbn=978-0-88365-403-3|date=1 May 1989|page=[https://archive.org/details/worldwariismalla0000week/page/130 130]|archiveurl= |archivedate= }}</ref> This request called for a compact, lightweight defensive weapon with greater range, accuracy and firepower than handguns, while weighing half as much as the [[Thompson submachine gun]] or the [[M1 rifle]].<ref name=\"George, John 1981 p. 394\">{{cite book |author1=George, John|title=Shots Fired In Anger |edition=2nd Revised & Enlarged |location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=National Rifle Association of America|isbn=978-0935998429 |date=1981|page=394}}</ref> The U.S. Army decided that a carbine would adequately fulfill all of these requirements, but specified that the new arm should weigh no more than five pounds and have an effective range of 300 yards.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ozvYaxr6iQ|title=M1 Carbine at 300 Yards|first=|last= |date=2 October 2012|website=YouTube|format=Video}}</ref><ref name=\"Ruth\">{{cite book |author1=Ruth, Larry L.|title=M1 Carbine: Design, Development & Production|publisher=The Gun Room Press|url=https://www.abebooks.com/M1-CARBINE-DESIGN-DEVELOPMENT-PRODUCTION-Ruth/22379562692/bd |date=1988 |isbn=0-88227-020-6|quote=contains many Ordnance documents related to the \"Light Rifle\" specification that led to the M1 carbine}}</ref> Paratroopers were also added to the list of intended users and a folding-stock version would also be developed.\n\n===Designing the M1 carbine===\nIn 1938, the Chief of Infantry requested that the Ordnance Department develop a \"light rifle\" or carbine, though the formal requirement for the weapon type was not approved until 1940. This led to a competition in 1941 by major U.S. firearm companies and designers.\n\n[[Winchester Repeating Arms Company|Winchester]] at first did not submit a carbine design, as it was occupied in developing the .30-06 Winchester M2 military rifle. The rifle originated as a design by Jonathan \"Ed\" Browning, brother of the famous firearm designer [[John Browning]]. A couple of months after Ed Browning's death in May 1939, Winchester hired [[David Marshall Williams|David Marshall \"Carbine\" Williams]] who had begun work on a [[Gas-operated reloading#Short-stroke piston|short-stroke gas piston]] design while serving a prison sentence at a North Carolina minimum-security work farm. Winchester, after Williams' release, had hired Williams on the strength of recommendations of firearms industry leaders and hoped Williams would be able to complete various designs left unfinished by Ed Browning, including the Winchester .30-06 M2 rifle. Williams incorporated his short-stroke piston in the existing design. After the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] semi-automatic rifle trials in 1940, Browning's rear-locking tilting bolt design proved unreliable in sandy conditions. As a result, the rifle was redesigned to incorporate a Garand-style [[rotating bolt]] and operating rod, retaining Williams' short-stroke piston. By May 1941, Williams had shaved the M2 rifle prototype from about {{convert|9.5|lb|abbr=on}} to a mere {{convert|7.5|lb|abbr=on}}.\n\nOrdnance found unsatisfactory the first series of prototype carbines submitted by several firearms companies and some independent designers.<ref name=\"Ruth\"/>  Winchester had contacted the Ordnance Corps to examine their rifle M2 design. Major Ren\u00e9 Studler of Ordnance believed the rifle design could be scaled down to a carbine which would weigh 4.5 to 4.75&nbsp;lb {{nowrap|(2.0\u20132.2 kg)}} and demanded a prototype as soon as possible. The first model was developed at Winchester in 13 days by William C. Roemer, Fred Humeston and three other Winchester engineers under supervision of Edwin Pugsley, and was essentially Williams' last version of the .30-06 M2 scaled down to the .30 SL cartridge.<ref name=\"Canfield, Bruce N. 2009\">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.americanrifleman.org/articles/2016/4/7/carbine-williams-myth-reality/|author1=Canfield, Bruce N.|title='Carbine' Williams: Myth & Reality|magazine=The American Rifleman|publisher=NRA Publications|date=7 April 2016 |format=February 2009 Reprint}}</ref> This patchwork prototype was cobbled together using the trigger housing and lockwork of a Winchester M1905 rifle and a modified Garand operating rod.

Williams participated in the finishing of this prototype. The second prototype competed successfully against all remaining carbine candidates in September 1941, and Winchester was notified of their success the very next month. Standardization as the M1 carbine was approved on October 22, 1941.  This story was the loose basis for the 1952 movie ''[[Carbine Williams]]'' starring [[James Stewart]]. Contrary to the movie, Williams had little to do with the carbine's development, with the exception of his short-stroke gas piston design. Williams worked on his own design apart from the other Winchester staff, but it was not ready for testing until December 1941, two months after the Winchester M1 carbine had been adopted and type-classified. Winchester supervisor Edwin Pugsley conceded that Williams' final design was \"an advance on the one that was accepted\", but noted that Williams' decision to go it alone was a distinct impediment to the project,<ref name=\"Canfield, Bruce N. 2009\"/> and Williams' additional design features were not incorporated into M1 production. In a 1951 memo written in fear of a patent infringement lawsuit by Williams, Winchester noted his patent for the short-stroke piston may have been improperly granted as a previous patent covering the same principle of operation was overlooked by the patent office.<ref name=\"Canfield, Bruce N. 2009\"/>\n\nIn 1973 the senior technical editor at the NRA contacted Edwin Pugsley for \"a technical last testament\" on M1 carbine history shortly before his death 19 Nov 1975. According to Pugsley, \"The carbine was invented by no single man,\" but was the result of a team effort including Bill Roemer, Marsh Williams, Fred Humeston, Cliff Warner, at least three other Winchester engineers, and Pugsley himself. Ideas were taken and modified from the Winchester M2 Browning rifle (Williams' gas system), the [[Winchester Model 1905 rifle]] (fire control group and magazine), M1 Garand (buttstock dimensions, and bolt and operating slide principles), and a percussion shotgun in Pugsley's collection (hook breech and barrel band assembly/disassembly).<ref>E.H.

As a result, the .30 carbine cartridge is approximately 27% more powerful than its parent cartridge. A standard .30 carbine ball bullet weighs 110 grains (7.1&nbsp;g), a complete loaded round weighs 195 grains (12.6&nbsp;g) and has a muzzle velocity of 1,990&nbsp;ft/s (610&nbsp;m/s) giving it 967&nbsp;ft\u00b7lbf (1,311 joules) of energy, when fired from the M1 carbine's 18\" barrel.\n\nBy comparison, the [[.30-06]] [[M1 Garand]] is almost 3 times more powerful than the M1 carbine. However, the carbine is twice as powerful as the [[.45ACP]] caliber submachine guns in common use at the time. As a result, the carbine offers much better range, accuracy and penetration than those submachine guns.<ref name=\"George, John 1981 p. 394\"/> The M1 is also half the weight of a [[Thompson submachine gun]] and fires a lighter cartridge. Therefore, soldiers armed with the carbine can carry much more ammunition than those armed with a Tommy gun.\n\nCategorizing the M1 carbine series has been the subject of much debate. Although commonly compared to the later German [[Sturmgewehr 44|StG44]] and Russian [[AK-47]], the M1 and M2 carbines are under-powered and outclassed by comparison.<ref name=\"Rottman_Green\"/> The carbine instead falls somewhere between the submachine gun and the assault rifle, and could be called a precursor of the [[personal defense weapon]] since it fulfilled a similar role.\n\nOne characteristic of .30 caliber carbine ammunition is that from the beginning of production, [[Centerfire ammunition#Centerfire primers|non-corrosive primers]] were specified. This was the first major use of this type of primer in a military firearm.  Because the rifle had a closed gas system, not normally disassembled, corrosive primers would have led to a rapid deterioration of the gas system.<ref name=\"The_AmericanRifleman_to_War\">{{cite book |last1=Roberts |first1=Joseph B. |title=The American rifleman goes to war: The guns, troops, and training of World War II as reported in NRA's magazine |date=1992 |publisher=National Rifle Association of America |page=20 |edition=First |isbn=0935998632 }}</ref>  The use of non-corrosive primers was a novelty in service ammunition at this time.<ref name=\"Dunlap\">{{cite book |author1=Dunlap, Roy F. |title=Ordnance Went Up Front|publisher=R&R Books |date=1993 |pages=240,293\u2013297|edition=1st|url=https://www.abebooks.com/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=30503157727&tab=1&searchurl=sortby%3D17%26tn%3Dordnance%2Bwent%2Bup%2Bfront&cm_sp=snippet-_-srp1-_-seller6}}</ref>  Some failures to fire were reported in early lots of .30 caliber carbine ammunition, attributed to moisture ingress of the non-corrosive primer compound.<ref name=\"Shore, C. 1988 pp. 191-195\"/>\n\n===Sights, range & accuracy===\nThe M1 carbine entered service with a simple flip sight, which had two settings: 150 and 300 yards.<ref name=\"FM23-7\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/ref/FM/PDFs/FM23-7.PDF|title=BASIC FIELD MANUAL - U.S. CARBINE, CALIBER .30, Ml|date=20 May 1942|publisher=War Department |format=FM 23-7}}</ref> However, field reports indicated that this sight was inadequate, and in 1944, it was replaced by a sliding ramp-type adjustable sight with four settings: 100, 200, 250 and 300 yards.<ref name=\"Leroy_M1\"/> This new rear sight was also adjustable for windage.\n\nAt {{convert|100|yd}}, the M1 carbine can deliver groups between 3 and 5 inches, sufficient for its intended purpose as a close-range defensive weapon.

This field adaptation was never officially approved, but proved an efficient method to supply extra ammunition in combat.  After the introduction of the 30-round magazine, it was common for troops to tape two 30-round magazines together, a practice that became known as \"[[Jungle style (firearm magazines)|Jungle style]]\". This led the military to introduce the \"Holder, Magazine T3-A1\" also called the \"Jungle Clip\", a metal clamp that held two magazines together without the need for tape.\n\nThe 30-round magazines introduced for use with the selective-fire M2 carbine would not be reliably retained by the magazine catch made for the original M1 carbine which was designed to retain a 15-round magazine, so the much heavier (when loaded) 30-round magazine would not be properly seated in the M1 carbine magazine well. The loaded 30-round magazine would typically cant (impairing feed reliability) or even fall out, which helps explain why the 30-round magazines have a poor reliability record (they are also more prone to damage due to their added length and weight when loaded as thin steel is used to make them). Thus early production M1 carbines must be fitted with the type IV magazine catch used on the M2 carbine (and late production M1 carbines) if they are to be used with 30-round magazines. The type IV magazine catch will have a leg on the left side to correspond with the additional nub on the 30-round magazines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forums.thecmp.org/showthread.php?t=5377 |title=Carbine magazine catches |publisher=Civilian Marksmanship Program|date=January 2010 |accessdate=10 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nInitial combat reports noted that M1 carbine's magazine release button was often mistaken for the safety button while under fire.<ref name=\"Leroy_M1\"/>  When this occurred, pressing the mag release caused the loaded magazine to drop into the dirt, while the safety remained in the off position. As a result, the push-button safety was redesigned using a rotating lever.<ref name=\"Leroy_M1\"/><ref name=\"M1_Warrior\">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.gunsandammo.com/blogs/history-books/m1-carbine-americas-unlikely-warrior/|magazine=Guns & Ammo|title=M1 Carbine: America's Unlikely Warrior|author1=James, Garry|date=6 October 2014|quote=The M1 carbine (M1A1 shown) was one of America's most widely used arms in three major conflicts and a popular lend/lease item to Allied countries.}}</ref>\n\n===Accessories===\nOriginally the M1 carbine did not have a bayonet lug, but it was often issued with an [[M3 fighting knife]] or a bayonet converted into a fighting knife. Due to requests from the field, the carbine was modified to incorporate a bayonet lug attached to the barrel band starting in 1945.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rjmilitaria.com/m1carbineb.htm|title= Collecting The M1 carbine|publisher=RJ Militaria|accessdate=29 October 2015}}</ref> However, very few carbines with bayonet lugs reached the front lines before the end of World War II. After the war, the bayonet lug was added to many M1 carbines during the arsenal refurbishing process. By the start of the [[Korean War]], the bayonet lug-equipped M1 was standard issue. It is now rare to find an original M1 carbine without the bayonet lug. The M1 carbine mounts the standard [[M4 bayonet]], which was based on the earlier [[M3 fighting knife]] and formed the basis for the later [[M5 bayonet|M5]], [[M6 bayonet|M6]] and [[M7 bayonet]]-knives.\n\nA folding-stock version of the carbine (the M1A1) was also developed after a request for a compact and light infantry arm for airborne troops. The Inland Division of General Motors manufactured 140,000 of them in two product runs in late 1942.<ref name=\"rjmilitaria.com\"/> They were originally issued to the 82nd and 101st Airborne divisions but were later issued to all U.S. Army airborne units and the  U.S. Marine Corps.<ref name=\"rjmilitaria.com\"/>  The folding-stock M1A1 is an unusual design in that the stock is not locked in the open or closed position, but is instead held in place by a spring-loaded cam.\n\nAs carbines were reconditioned, parts such as the magazine catch, rear sight, barrel band without bayonet lug, and stock were upgraded with current standard-issue parts. Also, both during and after World War II, many semi-automatic M1 carbines were converted to select-fire M2 carbines by using the T17 and T18 conversion kits.<ref name=\"Firearm_ID\">{{cite book |title=Cartridges and Firearm Identification |author1=Walker, Robert E.|publisher=CRC Press|edition=1st |page= 254|isbn=978-1466502062|date=2012-11-26}}</ref> The conversion included a modified sear, slide, and trigger housing, and added a disconnector, disconnector lever, and selector switch that could be set for semi-auto or full-automatic fire.\n\nDuring World War II, the T23 (M3) [[Flash suppressor|flash hider]] was designed to reduce the muzzle flash from the carbine, but was not introduced into service until the advent of the M3 carbine.<ref name=\"Ruth, Larry L. 1992 pp. 621-623\">{{cite book |author1=Ruth, Larry L. |title=War Baby: The U.S. Caliber .30 Carbine, Vol. 1|publisher=Collector Grade Publications |isbn=978-0-88935-117-2 |edition=1st Limited|date=1992|pages= 621\u2013623}}</ref>  With the exception of T23 hiders mounted on M3 carbines, few if any T23 flash-hider attachments saw service during the war, though unit armorers occasionally hand-built improvised compensator/flash-hiders of their own design.<ref name=\"Ruth, Larry L. 1992 pp. 621-623\"/><ref name=\"Dunlap\"/>\n\nThe M1 carbine was used with the [[M8 grenade launcher]], which was developed in early 1944. It was fired with the .30 caliber carbine M6 Grenade Blank cartridge to launch [[22 mm grenade|22 mm rifle grenades]]. Stress from firing rifle grenades would eventually crack the carbine's stock. It also could not use the M8 launcher with an M7 auxiliary \"booster\" charge (to extend its range) without breaking the stock. This made it a type of emergency-issue weapon.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Battle of the Bulge.jpg|thumb|American infantrymen of the 290th Regiment fight in fresh snowfall near Amonines, Belgium. Soldier in foreground is armed with an M1 carbine.]]\n\nA total of over 6.1 million M1 carbines of various models was manufactured, making it the most produced small arm for the American military during World War II (compared with about 5.4 million M1 rifles and about 1.3 million Thompson submachine guns). Despite being designed by Winchester, the great majority of these were made by other companies (see [[M1_carbine#Military contractors|\u00a7 Military contractors]] below). The largest producer was the Inland division of [[General Motors]], but many others were made by contractors as diverse as [[IBM]], the Underwood Typewriter Company, and [[Rock-Ola|Rock-Ola Manufacturing Corporation]]. Few contractors made all the parts for carbines bearing their names: some makers bought parts from other major contractors or sub-contracted minor parts to companies like Marlin Firearms or Auto-Ordnance. Parts by all makers were required to be interchangeable. Often one company would get ahead or behind in production and parts would be shipped from one company to the other to help them catch up on their quota.  When receivers were shipped for this purpose the manufacturers would often mark them for both companies.  Some of the strangest combinations were the M1's made by the combined efforts of Underwood and Quality Hardware, resulting in the manufacturer mark UN-QUALITY.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cmpauction.thecmp.org/uploaded/2013-1-21/c912644d2Dfc9b2D418d2Db7d72D5741cbccf5e6DSC5F0020.JPG|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111230959/http://cmpauction.thecmp.org/uploaded/2013-1-21/c912644d2Dfc9b2D418d2Db7d72D5741cbccf5e6DSC5F0020.JPG|url-status=dead|archivedate=11 November 2013|title=UN-QUALITY Stamp|date=11 November 2013|format=Photo}}</ref> The receiver was subcontracted from Union Switch and Signal, not Underwood.

At the beginning of World War II the average production cost for an M1 carbine was approximately $45, about half the cost of an M1 rifle at approximately $85 and about a fifth of the cost of a [[Thompson submachine gun]] at approximately $225. The .30 Caliber carbine ammunition was also far cheaper to produce than the standard .30-06 ammunition; used fewer resources, was smaller, lighter, faster and easier to make. These were major factors in the United States military decision to adopt the M1 carbine, especially when considering the vast numbers of weapons and ammunition manufactured and transported by the United States during World War II.\n\n==U.S. combat use==\n===World War II===\n\n[[File:USMC M1 Carbine.JPEG|thumb|U.S. Marine in combat at Guam.]]\n[[File:First Iwo Jima Flag Raising.jpg|thumb|M1 carbine at first Iwo Jima flag raising.]]\n\nThe M1 carbine with its reduced-power .30 cartridge was not originally intended to serve as a primary weapon for combat infantrymen, nor was it comparable to more powerful assault rifles developed late in the war. However, it was markedly superior to the .45 caliber submachineguns in use at the time in both accuracy and penetration,<ref name=\"George, John 1981 p. 394\"/> and its lighter .30 caliber cartridge allowed soldiers to carry more ammunition.

The M1 carbine in the foreground has the bayonet mounted.]]\nInitially, the M1 carbine was intended to have a [[selective-fire|select-fire]] capability, but the requirement for rapid production of the new carbine resulted in the omission of this feature from the Light Rifle Program. On 26 October 1944, in response to the Germans' widespread use of automatic weapons, especially the [[Sturmgewehr 44]] [[assault rifle]], the select-fire '''M2 carbine''' was introduced, along with a new 30-round magazine. The M2 had a fully automatic rate-of-fire of about 850\u2013900 rounds-per-minute. Although actual M2 production began late in the war (April 1945), U.S. Ordnance issued conversion-part kits to allow field conversion of semi-auto M1 carbines to the selective-fire M2 configuration. These converted M1/M2 select-fire carbines saw limited combat service in Europe, primarily during the final Allied advance into Germany. In the Pacific, both converted and original M2 carbines saw limited use in the last days of the fighting in the Philippines.<ref name=\"Dunlap\"/>\n\n====Infrared sight versions====\nThe '''M3 carbine''' was an M2 carbine  with the M2 infrared night sight or ''[[Sniperscope#Generation 0|sniperscope]]''.<ref name=\"Century 2000. page 290\"/> The M3 did not have [[iron sights]].<ref name=\"Century 2000. page 290\"/> It was first used in combat by Army units during the [[Battle of Okinawa|invasion of Okinawa]], about 150 M3 carbines were used on Okinawa. For the first time, U.S. soldiers had a weapon that allowed them to visually detect Japanese infiltrating into American lines at night, even during complete darkness. A team of two or three soldiers was used to operate the weapon and provide support.<ref name=\"Rush_GI\"/>  At night, the scope would be used to detect Japanese patrols and assault units moving forward.  At that point, the operator would fire a burst of automatic fire at the greenish images of enemy soldiers.<ref name=\"Rush_GI\"/>  The M3 carbine had an effective range of about 70 yards (64 meters), limited by the visual capabilities of the sight.<ref name=\"Article\">{{cite web |title=M3 Infra Red Night Sight |url=http://www.rt66.com/~korteng/SmallArms/m3irsnip.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005050126/http://www.rt66.com/~korteng/SmallArms/m3irsnip.htm |archivedate=2008-10-05|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Fog and rain further reduced the weapon's effective range.<ref name=\"Rush_GI\"/><ref name=\"Article\"/> However, it is estimated that fully 30% of Japanese casualties inflicted by rifle and carbine fire during the Okinawan campaign were caused by the M3 carbine.<ref name=\"Rush_GI\"/>\n\nThe system was refined over time, and by the Korean War the improved M3 infrared night sight was in service. The M3 sight has a longer effective range than its predecessor, about 125 yards (114 meters). However, it still required the user to carry a heavy backpack-mounted battery pack to power the scope and infrared light. They were used primarily in static defensive positions in Korea to locate troops attempting to infiltrate in darkness. M3 operators would not only use their carbines to dispatch individual targets, but also used tracer ammo to identify troop concentrations for machine gunners to decimate.<ref name=\"Leroy_M1\"/> In total, about 20,000 sets were made before they became obsolete, and were surplussed to the public.\n\n===Korean War===\n[[File:Korean War HA-SN-98-07010.jpg|thumb|right| M1 carbine in action during Korean War.

The \"(a)\" came from the country name in German; in this case, ''Amerika''. It was also used by German police and border guards in [[Bavaria]] after World War II and into the 1950s. The carbines were stamped according to the branch they were in service with; for instance, those used by the border guard were stamped \"''[[Bundesgrenzschutz]]''\". Some of these weapons were modified with different sights, finishes, and sometimes new barrels.\n\n===Japanese GSDF===\nA variant was produced shortly after World War II by the Japanese manufacturer Howa Machinery, under U.S. supervision. These were issued to all branches of the [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]], and large numbers of them found their way to [[Southeast Asia]] during the Vietnam War. Howa also made replacement parts for US-made M1 carbines issued to Japanese police and military.\n\n=== Israel Defense Forces ===\nThe M1 carbine was also used by the Israeli [[Palmach]]-based [[special forces]] in the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]]. And, because of their compact size and semi-auto capabilities, they continued to be used by [[Israeli Defence Forces]] after the creation of Israel. The [[Israeli police]] still use the M1 carbine as a standard long gun for non-combat elements and [[Mash'az]] volunteers.\n\n=== French Army ===\nThe U.S. provided France with 269,644 [[M1 carbines|M1 and M2 carbines]] from World War II to 1963.<ref name=\"bmc\" /> The carbines were used by the French Paratroopers and [[French Foreign Legion|Legionnaires]], as well specialists (drivers, radio operators, engineers), during the [[Indo-China War]],<ref name=\"mcnab2002\">{{cite book |author1=McNab, Chris |editor1-first=Charles C. |editor1-last=Unwin |editor2-first=Mike R. |editor2-last=Vanessa U. |title=20th Century Military Uniforms |date=31 July 2002 |edition=2nd |publisher=Grange Books |location=Kent |isbn=1-84013-476-3|ref=harv|page=84}}</ref> the [[Algerian War]]<ref name =\"Algeria\">{{cite magazine|language=fr|magazine=Gazette des Armes |issue=220 |date=March 1992|title=L'armement fran\u00e7ais en A.F.N.|trans-title=|pages=12\u201316|url=http://fr.1001mags.com/parution/gazette-des-armes/numero-220-mars-1992/page-14-15-texte-integral|first=Jean|last=Huon}}</ref> and the [[Suez Crisis]].\n[[File:Female South Vietnamese Popular Force members on patrol in B\u1ebfn C\u00e1t District.JPEG|thumb|right|South Vietnamese Popular Force members on patrol with M1 carbines.]]\n[[File:Photo taken by Phillip Kemp from cockpit after sling-loading water drums to outpost..jpg|thumb|ROK troops armed with M1 carbines during the Vietnam War.]]\n[[File:CheMuleFull.jpg|thumb|[[Che Guevara]] atop a mule in [[Santa Clara Province|Las Villas province]], [[Cuba]], in November 1958, with an M2 Carbine.]]\n\n=== South Vietnam ===\nThe U.S. provided the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] with 793,994 M1 and M2 carbines from 1963 to 1973.<ref name=\"bmc\" /> Along with tens of thousands of carbines left behind by the French after the [[First Indochina War]], the M1 and M2 carbines were the most widely issued small arm during the early stages in the Vietnam War and remained in service in large numbers until the [[fall of Saigon]].

Over time, the [[SKS]] and eventually the [[AK-47]] would replace the carbine to become the dominant weapons used by the Viet Cong.\n\n=== South Korea ===\nThe [[Republic of Korea Armed Forces]] received 1,015,568 M1 and M2 carbines from 1963 to 1972.<ref name=\"bmc\"/> Along with hundreds of thousands of Carbines and M1 Garands provided by the United States Army before, during and shortly after the [[Korean war]], South Korea would become the largest single recipient of American M1 and M2 carbines.\n\nSouth Korea also took an active role in the Vietnam War. From 1964 to 1973, South Korea sent more than 300,000 troops to South Vietnam armed primarily with M1 and M2 carbines, as well as M1 Garands.\n\n=== Philippines ===\nThe government of the [[Philippines]] still issues M1 carbines to the infantrymen of the Philippine Army's [[2nd Infantry (Jungle Fighter) Division|2nd Infantry Division]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} assigned in Luzon Island  (some units are issued just M14 automatic rifles and M1 carbines) and the Civilian Auxiliary Forces Geographical Unit (CAFGU) and Civilian Volunteer Organizations (CVO)spread throughout the Philippines. Certain provincial police units of the Philippine National Police (PNP) still use government-issue M1 carbines as well as some operating units of the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI). In many provinces of the Philippines, M1 carbines are still highly valued as a light small arm. Elements of the New People's Army and Islamic Secessionist movement value the carbine as a lightweight weapon and preferred choice for mountain and ambush operations.\n\nThe M1 carbine has become one of the most recognized firearms in Philippine society, with the Marikina City-based company ARMSCOR Philippines still continuing to manufacture .30 caliber ammunition for the Philippine market.\n\n=== Latin America ===\nThe M1 and M2 carbines were widely used by military, police, and security forces and their opponents during the many guerrilla and civil wars throughout [[Latin America]] until the 1990s, when they were mostly replaced by more modern designs. A notable user was [[Che Guevara]] who used them during the [[Cuban Revolution]] and in [[Bolivia]] where he was executed by a Bolivian soldier armed with an M2 carbine.<ref>{{cite web| title=The Death of Che Guevara: Declassified| publisher=The National Security Archive| url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB5/| accessdate=2016-01-24}}</ref> Guevara's fellow revolutionary [[Camilo Cienfuegos]] also used an M2 carbine that he modified with the pistol grip and foregrip from a [[Thompson submachine gun]].

The M2 featured the late M1 improvements to the rear sight, addition of a bayonet lug, and other minor changes.\n\nResearch into a conversion kit for selective fire began May 1944; the first kit was developed by Inland engineers, and known as the T4. Inland was awarded a contract for 500 T4 carbines in September 1944. Although the conversion was seen as satisfactory, the heavier 30-round magazine\nput greater strain on the magazine catch, necessitating the development of a sturdier catch. The slide, sear, and stock design also had to be modified. On fully automatic fire, the T4 model could fire about 750 rounds per minute, but generated a manageable recoil.<ref name=\"Leroy_M1\"/>\n\nAlthough some carbines were marked at the factory as M2, the only significant difference between an M1 and M2 carbine is in the fire control group. The military issued field conversion kits (T17 and T18) to convert an M1 to an M2. Legally a carbine marked M2 is always a machine gun for [[National Firearms Act of 1934|national firearms registry]] purposes.\n\nThese M2 parts including the heavier M2 stock were standardized for arsenal rebuild of M1 and M1A1 carbines.\n\nA modified round bolt replaced the original flat top bolt to save machining steps in manufacture.  Many sources erroneously refer to this round bolt as an 'M2 bolt' but it was developed as a standard part for new manufacture M1 and later M2 carbines and as a replacement part, with priority given to use on M1A1 and M2 carbines.<ref name=\"Ruth\"/> The slightly heavier round bolt did moderate the cyclic rate of the M2 on full automatic.<ref name=\"Small_Arms\">{{cite book |author1=Smith, W.H.B. |title=Small Arms of the World|publisher=Stackpole |date=May 1990|edition=12th|isbn=978-0880296014|quote=illustrates an M2 carbine in an M1A1 stock on p.642 and a parts breakdown of the M2 on p.646 is shown with a flat top bolt}}</ref>\n\nDespite being in demand, very few M2 carbines saw use during World War II, and then mostly in the closing days against Japan.<ref name=\"Leroy_M1\"/> The M2 carbine was logistically compatible with the millions of M1 carbines in U.S. service, and offered longer range, better accuracy and better penetration than (pistol caliber) [[submachine gun]]s like the [[M1 Thompson submachine gun|M1 Thompsons]] and [[M3 submachine gun|M3 Grease Guns]].<ref>America's Favorite Gun. by Gold V. Sanders. Popular Science Aug 1944. pp. 84\u201387, 221</ref> Therefore, after World War II, the M2 carbine largely replaced the submachine-guns in U.S. service, until it was itself replaced by the M16 rifle.<ref name=\"The M16 2011. page 6\"/>\n\nThe M2 model was the most widely used Carbine variant during the [[Korean War]].<ref name=\"Leroy_M1\"/> A detailed study of the effectiveness of the M2 in the war was assembled by [[S. L. A. Marshall]]. He found that many troops complained on the lack of effective range of the gun, which allowed the enemy to get close enough to throw [[hand grenade]]s. A more detailed analysis showed however that most troops who complained actually tended to run low on ammo, because they fired their M2 on fully automatic too soon. Troops who fired their guns on semi-automatic at distance generally complained less about the M2's effectiveness. Generally, the more seasoned troops used the latter approach. The carbine was usually given to second line troops (administrative, support, etc.), who had little combat experience and also did not have much training in [[small unit tactics|small-unit tactics]], but who usually had to engage the enemy at some critical moment, like a breakthrough or ambush. Marshall noted that almost all killing shots with carbines in Korea were at ranges of 50 yards or less. It was unsurprising therefore that the M2 was a preferred weapon for [[night combat|night patrols]]. The M2 was also used in the early stages of the [[Vietnam War]] by special forces, [[ARVN]] advisers, and air crews.<ref name=\"Leroy_M1\"/>\n\nContemporary authors have struggled to categorize the M2 carbine. On one hand, it is more powerful than a submachine gun and is considered by some to be an [[assault rifle]], even though it fires a projectile considerably less powerful than the [[StG 44]]'s [[7.92\u00d733mm Kurz]]. On the other hand, the M2 can also be considered a precursor of the modern [[personal defense weapon]] (PDW) concept, even though contemporary guns in that category, like the [[FN P90]], fire substantially different cartridges like the [[5.7\u00d728mm]].<ref name=\"Leroy_M1\"/>\n\n===Carbine, Cal. 30, M2A2===\n* Arsenal-refurbished (overstamped M2) model\n\n===Carbine, Cal .30, M3===\n* M2 with mounting (T3 mount) for an early active (infrared) night vision sight\n* About 3,000 produced\n* Three versions of night sight (M1, M2, M3)\n\n[[File:M3 Sniperscope.jpg|thumb|right|Original Korean War era USMC M3 Night Vision Scope]]\n\nThe M3 carbine was an M2 carbine fitted with a mount designed to accept an infrared sight for use at night.  It was initially used with the M1 [[Image intensifier#Generation 0|sniperscope]], and an active [[infrared]] sight, and saw action in 1945 with the Army during the invasion of Okinawa.  Before the M3 carbine and M1 sniperscope were type-classified, they were known as the T3 and T120, respectively. The system continued to be developed, and by the time of the [[Korean War]], the M3 carbine was used with the M3 sniperscope.\n\nThe M2 sniper scope extended the effective nighttime range of the M3 carbine to 100 yards.  In the later stages of the Korean War, an improved version of the M3 carbine, with a revised mount, a forward pistol grip, and a new M3 sniperscope design was used in the latter stages of Korea and briefly in Vietnam.  The M3 sniperscope had a large active infrared spotlight mounted on top of the scope body itself, allowing use in the prone position. The revised M3/M3 had an effective range of around 125 yards.<ref name=\"Article\"/> Eventually, the M3 carbine and its M3 sniperscope would be superseded by passive-design night vision scopes with extended visible ranges; the improved scopes in turn required the use of rifle-caliber weapons with flatter trajectories and increased hit probability.\n\n==Derivatives==\n===Ingram SAM===\n\nThe [[Military Armament Corporation|Ingram]] SAM rifles are M1 carbine derivatives in [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]] (SAM-1), [[7.62\u00d739mm]] (SAM-2) and [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]] (SAM-3). The 5.56\u00d745mm versions accept M16 magazines, the 7.62\u00d739mm accept AK magazines and the 7.62\u00d751mm versions use FN FAL magazines.

The new Inland M1 carbines feature many of the same characteristics of the original Inland Carbines and are manufactured in the USA.  The M1 carbine is modeled after the last production model that Inland manufactured in 1945 and features a type 3 bayonet lug / barrel band, adjustable rear sights, push button safety, round bolt, and \"low wood\" walnut stock, and a 15-round magazine.  A 30-round mag catch was utilized to allow high-capacity magazines. A \"1944\" M1 Carbine is also available that has the same features as the 1945 only with a Type 2 barrel Band and 10-round magazine and is available for sale in most states with magazine capacity & bayonet lug restrictions.

Although not banned by name, make or model, M1 Carbines may in some cases be classified as contraband assault weapon under the 2013 NY SAFE act if they feature bayonet lugs, pistol grips, folding stocks and flash suppressors. 10-round magazines are available in states that restrict magazine capacity for civilian firearms.\n\nThe M1 carbine was also used by various law enforcement agencies and prison guards, and was prominently carried by riot police during the civil unrest of the late 1960s and early 1970s; until it was replaced in those roles by more modern .223 caliber semi-automatic rifles such as the [[Ruger Mini-14]] and the [[Colt AR-15]] type rifles in the late 1970s and early 1980s.\n\nThe ease of use and great adaptability of the weapon led to it being used by [[Malcolm X]] and [[Patty Hearst]].

An M1 was also the weapon used in the 1947 assassination of notorious American mobster [[Bugsy Siegel | Benjamin \"Bugsy\" Siegel]].\n\n==Related equipment and accessories==\n===Ammunition types===\n{{Main|.30 Carbine}}\nThe ammunition used by the military with the carbine include:<ref>''TM 9-1305-200/TO 11A13-1-101 Small-Arms Ammunition'', 1961, pp. 39\u201341</ref>\n* Cartridge, Caliber .30, Carbine, Ball, M1\n* Cartridge, Grenade, Caliber .30, M6 (also authorized for other blank firing uses, due to a lack of a dedicated blank cartridge)\n* Cartridge, Caliber .30, Carbine, Dummy, M13\n* Cartridge, Caliber .30, Carbine, Ball, Test, High Pressure, M18\n* Cartridge, Caliber .30, Carbine, Tracer, M16 (also rated as having an incendiary effect)\n* Cartridge, Caliber .30, Carbine, Tracer, M27 (dimmer illumination and no incendiary effect)\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of U.S. Army weapons by supply catalog designation]] SNL B-28\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n* Barnes, Frank C., ''Cartridges of the World'', Iola, WI: DBI Books Inc., {{ISBN|0-87349-033-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-87349-033-7}}, (6th ed., 1989).\n* {{cite magazine|author=Canfield, Bruce N. |title=A New Lease on Life: The Post-World War II M1 Carbine |magazine=American Rifleman |date=June 2007}}\n* Dunlap, Roy F.

He became the club's Technical Director in 2013 as part of the club's acceptance into National Premier Leagues WA. \nCurrently Goalkeeper Coach at Bali United FC in the Indonesian Liga 1 after holding a similar role at PSIS Semarang who also play in the Indonesian Liga 1 in 2018.\nWas Head Goalkeeper Coach/ Assistant Coach at Ilocos United FC who competed in the Inaugural Season of the Philippine Football League (2017).\nWas Perth Glory FC Westfield W League Goalkeeper Coach (2015-2017). \nInducted into the Western Australian Football Hall of Fame 2016.\n\n==Playing career==\nPetterson began his career in his native Australia, leaving [[East Fremantle Tricolore]] in 1988 to join the Australian Institute of Sport in Canberra. In November 1988 he left Australia to join English side [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]]. He spent time with [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] and [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]], where he became the first Western Australian-born player to appear in the newly formed Premier League in a 2\u20131 win over [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] before joining [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] in July 1994 for a fee of \u00a385,000.\n\nHe was third-choice keeper for most of the 1994\u201395 and 1995\u201396 seasons, behind [[Mike Salmon]] and American [[Mike Ammann]], spending time on loan with [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]], [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]], [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]] and [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]]. However, with both Salmon and Ammann injured towards the end of the 1995\u201396 season, Petterson played well enough in the final nine games, conceding only five goals and helping the club to the play off Semi Finals, to earn a new contract. He began the following season as Salmon's deputy, but after his return to the side in January 1997 became first choice, winning the club's player of the year award at the end of the season. The start of the 1997\u201398 season saw Petterson as Charlton's first choice keeper, but after 26 appearances lost his place to first Salmon and then [[Sa\u0161a Ili\u0107 (footballer, born 1972)|Sasa Ilic]] as [[Charlton Athletic FC|Charlton Athletic]] gained promotion to the Premier League via a Wembley play-off final win over [[Sunderland AFC|Sunderland]]. Petterson started the 1998-99 Premier League season for [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] as deputy to Ilic and made his first appearance as a substitute in a 2\u20131 loss to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] at Stamford Bridge. He then started the next game as the Addicks defeated [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] 4\u20132 at the Valley. Petterson again returned to the substitute's bench after Ilic was declared fit before he was allowed to join [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] on loan in November 1998 as cover for [[Alan Knight (footballer)|Alan Knight]]. Petterson stayed until February, helping Pompey survive relegation in 1999 before returning to an unsuccessful relegation battle for Charlton Athletic as the South London club returned to the Championship after just one season in the top flight.\n\nPetterson signed for [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] on a free transfer in July 1999 as Alan Ball looked to strengthen his squad after the club's take over. Petterson was a regular under Ball, but with the managers dismissal from the club in November he struggled to establish himself at Fratton Park and had loan spells with [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] (February to May 2000) and [[Torquay United F.C.|Torquay United]] (March to April 2001). Following a calf injury in pre-season, Petterson failed to make the Pompey first team at all in the 2001\u201302 season, being behind [[Dave Beasant]] and Japan National Team GK [[Yoshi Kawaguchi]] in the pecking order and was allowed to join [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] on a free transfer in March 2002. At the Hawthorns he was understudy to [[Russell Hoult]], as he had been at Portsmouth, and although failed to make the first team appearance he was part of the Baggies squad who gained promotion to the Premier League after finishing as runners-up in the Championship. He was released at the end of the season.,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/west_bromwich_albion/1948752.stm Fox to leaves Baggies]</ref> and then joined Championship new boys [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]] in August 2002.

He became the club's Technical Director in 2013 as part of the club's acceptance into National Premier Leagues WA. \nCurrently Goalkeeper Coach at Bali United FC in the Indonesian Liga 1 after holding a similar role at PSIS Semarang who also play in the Indonesian Liga 1 in 2018.\nWas Head Goalkeeper Coach/ Assistant Coach at Ilocos United FC who competed in the Inaugural Season of the Philippine Football League (2017).\nWas Perth Glory FC Westfield W League Goalkeeper Coach (2015-2017). \nInducted into the Western Australian Football Hall of Fame 2016.\n\n==Playing Career==\nPetterson began his career in his native Australia, leaving [[East Fremantle Tricolore]] in 1988 to join the Australian Institute of Sport in Canberra. In November 1988 he left Australia to join English side [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]]. He spent time with [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] and [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]], where he became the first Western Australian-born player to appear in the newly formed Premier League in a 2\u20131 win over [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] before joining [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] in July 1994 for a fee of \u00a385,000.\n\nHe was third-choice keeper for most of the 1994\u201395 and 1995\u201396 seasons, behind [[Mike Salmon]] and American [[Mike Ammann]], spending time on loan with [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]], [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]], [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.| Plymouth Argyle]] and [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]]. However, with both Salmon and Ammann injured towards the end of the 1995\u201396 season, Petterson played well enough in the final nine games, conceding only five goals and helping the club to the play off Semi Finals, to earn a new contract. He began the following season as Salmon's deputy, but after his return to the side in January 1997 became first choice, winning the club's player of the year award at the end of the season. The start of the 1997\u201398 season saw Petterson as Charlton's first choice keeper, but after 26 appearances lost his place to first Salmon and then [[Sa\u0161a Ili\u0107 (footballer, born 1972)|Sasa Ilic]] as [[Charlton Athletic FC|Charlton Athletic]] gained promotion to the Premier League via a Wembley play-off final win over [[Sunderland AFC|Sunderland]]. Petterson started the 1998-99 Premier League season for [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] as deputy to Ilic and made his first appearance as a substitute in a 2\u20131 loss to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] at Stamford Bridge. He then started the next game as the Addicks defeated [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] 4-2 at the Valley. Petterson again returned to the substitute's bench after Ilic was declared fit before he was allowed to join [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] on loan in November 1998 as cover for [[Alan Knight (footballer)|Alan Knight]]. Petterson stayed until February, helping Pompey survive relegation in 1999 before returning to an unsuccessful relegation battle for Charlton Athletic as the South London club returned to the Championship after just one season in the top flight.\n\nPetterson signed for [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] on a free transfer in July 1999 as Alan Ball looked to strengthen his squad after the club's take over. Petterson was a regular under Ball, but with the managers dismissal from the club in November he struggled to establish himself at Fratton Park and had loan spells with [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] (February to May 2000) and [[Torquay United F.C.|Torquay United]] (March to April 2001). Following a calf injury in pre-season, Petterson failed to make the Pompey first team at all in the 2001\u201302 season, being behind [[Dave Beasant]] and Japan National Team GK [[Yoshi Kawaguchi]] in the pecking order and was allowed to join [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] on a free transfer in March 2002. At the Hawthorns he was understudy to [[Russell Hoult]], as he had been at Portsmouth, and although failed to make the first team appearance he was part of the Baggies squad who gained promotion to the Premier League after finishing as runners-up in the Championship. He was released at the end of the season.,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/west_bromwich_albion/1948752.stm Fox to leaves Baggies]</ref> and then joined Championship new boys [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]] in August 2002. He was released by Brighton in December 2002<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/brighton/2540967.stm Brighton release duo]</ref> and later played in the [[League of Ireland]] for [[Derry City F.C.|Derry City]] until being released in April 2003.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/irish/2985451.stm Derry snap up goalkeeper]</ref>\n\nHe moved on to [[A.F.C.

The oil collects in sump (1), is withdrawn continuously by scavenge pump (2) and travels to the oil tank (3), where gases entrained in the oil separate and the oil cools. Gases (6) are returned to the engine sump. Pressure pump (4) forces the de-gassed and cooled oil (5) back to the engine's lubrication points (7).]]\nA '''dry-sump''' system is a method to manage the lubricating [[motor oil]] in [[Four-stroke engine|four-stroke]] and large [[Two-stroke engine|two-stroke]] [[piston]] driven [[internal combustion engine]]s. The dry-sump system uses two or more [[oil pump (internal combustion engine)|oil pumps]] and a separate oil reservoir, as opposed to a conventional [[wet sump|wet-sump]] system, which uses only the main [[sump]] (U.S.: oil pan) below the engine and a single pump. A dry-sump engine requires a pressure relief valve to regulate negative pressure inside the engine, so internal seals are not inverted.\n\nDry-sumps are common on larger [[Diesel engine|diesel engines]] such as those used in ships, as well as gasoline engines used in [[Auto racing|racing cars]], [[Aerobatics|aerobatic aircraft]] and high-performance motorcycles. Dry sump lubrication may be chosen for these applications due to increased reliability, oil capacity, reduction of oil starvation under high [[G-force|g]]-loads and/or other technical or performance reasons. Dry sump systems may not be suitable for all applications due to increased cost, complexity, and/or bulk, among other factors.\n\n== Mechanism ==\nEngines are both lubricated and cooled by oil that circulates throughout the engine, feeding various [[bearing (mechanical)|bearing]]s and other moving parts and then draining, via gravity, into the sump at the base of the engine. In the wet-sump system of most production [[Car|automobile]] engines, a pump collects this oil from the sump and directly circulates it back through the engine. In a dry-sump, the oil still falls to the base of the engine, however instead of collecting in a reservoir-style oil sump, it falls into a much shallower sump, where one or more scavenge pumps draw it away and transfer it to a (usually external) reservoir, where it is both cooled and [[Degasification|de-aerated]] before being recirculated through the engine by a pressure pump. Dry-sump designs frequently mount the pressure pump and scavenge pumps on a common crankshaft, so that one pulley at the front of the system can run as many pumps as the engine design requires. It is common practice to have one scavenge pump per [[crankcase]] section, however in the case of [[Inline engine (aviation)#Inverted engine|inverted engines]] ([[aircraft engine]]) it is necessary to employ separate scavenge pumps for each [[cylinder bank]]. Therefore, an inverted [[V engine]] would have a minimum of two scavenge pumps and a pressure pump in the pump ''stack''.\n\nThe main purpose of the dry-sump system is to contain all the stored oil in a separate tank, or reservoir. This reservoir is usually tall and round or narrow and specially designed with internal baffles, and an oil outlet (supply) at the very bottom for uninhibited oil supply. The dry-sump oil pump is a minimum of 2 stages, with as many as 5 or 6. One stage is for pressure and is supplied the oil from the bottom of the reservoir, and along with an adjustable pressure regulator, supplies the oil under pressure through the filter and into the engine. The remaining stages \"scavenge\" the oil out of the dry-sump pan and return the oil (and gasses) to the top of the tank or reservoir. If an oil cooler is used usually it is mounted inline between the scavenge outlets and the tank. The dry-sump pump is usually driven by a [[Toothed belt|Gilmer]] or High Torque Drive (HTD) timing belt and pulleys, off the front of the crankshaft, at approximately one half crank speed.  The dry-sump pump is designed with multiple stages to ensure that all the oil is scavenged from the pan and also to allow removal of excess air from the crankcase.<ref name=\"armstrong\">{{cite web|url=http://drysump.com/drysump.htm|title=Technical Description - The Dry Sump System|publisher=Armstrong Race Engineering, Gary Armstrong, DrySump.com, 08-03-2016}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.torquecars.com/tuning/dry-sumps.php|title=Dry Sump|website=TorqueCars|access-date=2016-12-24}}</ref>\n\n==Advantages==\nA dry-sump system offers many advantages over a wet-sump. The primary advantages include:<ref name=\"armstrong\" /><ref>Van Valkenburgh,Paul (1976) ''Race Car Engineering and Mechanics'' Dodd, Mead & Company, p. 181</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.superchevy.com/how-to/engines-drivetrain/camp-1109-dry-sump-oil-system/|title=Dry Sump Oil System - Camaro Performers Magazine|date=2011-09-01|publisher=Super Chevy|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-24}}</ref> \n* Improved engine reliability due to consistent oil pressure. This is the reason why dry-sumps were invented.  \n* Increased oil capacity by using a large external reservoir, that would be impractical in a wet-sump system. \n* Prevention of the engine experiencing oil-starvation during high [[g-force|g]]-loads, which is particularly useful in [[auto racing|racing]] cars, [[high performance vehicle|high performance]] sports cars, and [[aerobatic aircraft]]. Dry-sump designs are not susceptible to the oil movement problems from high cornering forces that wet-sump systems can suffer where the force of the vehicle cornering can cause the oil to pool on one side of the oil pan, possibly uncovering the oil pump pickup tube and causing cavitation and loss of oil pressure. \n* Improvements to vehicle handling and stability. The vehicle's [[center of gravity]] can be lowered by mounting the engine lower in the chassis due to a shallow sump profile. A vehicle's overall [[weight distribution]] can be modified by locating the external oil reservoir away from the engine. \n* Improved oil temperature control. This is due to increased oil volume providing resistance to heat saturation, the positioning of the oil reservoir away from the hot engine, and the ability to include cooling capabilities between the scavenger pumps and oil reservoir and also within the reservoir itself. \n* The ability to release gasses trapped in the oil from [[piston ring|ring]] blow-by and the action of the crankshaft and other moving parts in the oil, then return these gases via a line from the top of the oil reservoir to the combustion chamber. \n* Improved pump efficiency to maintain oil supply to the engine. Since scavenge pumps are typically mounted at the lowest point on the engine, the oil flows into the pump intake by gravity rather than having to be lifted up into the intake of the pump as in a wet-sump. Furthermore, scavenge pumps can be of a design that is more tolerant of entrapped gasses than the typical pressure pump, which can lose suction if too much air mixes into the oil. Since the pressure pump is typically lower than the external oil tank, it always has a positive pressure on its suction regardless of cornering forces. \n* Increased engine horsepower due to reduced viscous and air friction. In a wet-sump engine the crank shaft and other moving parts splash through the oil at thousands of [[revolutions per minute|RPM]]<nowiki/> causing a \"hurricane that whips the oil in a wet-sump engine into an aerated froth like a milkshake in a blender\".<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://rehermorrison.com/tech-talk-84-dry-sumps-dave-lives/|title=Tech Talk #84 \u2013 Dry Sumps Save Lives|last=Reher|first=David|date=2013-06-25|publisher=Reher Morrison Racing Engines|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-24|work=|via=}}</ref> Additionally, in a wet-sump, each revolution generates minute amounts of [[Parastic_load|parasitic power loss]] caused by viscous [[Drag_(physics)|drag]] and air drag (or '[[windage]]') as the parts move rapidly through the oil and air in the lower engine.

A good example is the classic [[Mercedes-Benz 300SL]], a car that was designed for racing but sold to the general public and used on-road. The car had high oil capacity and a dry-sump system to cope with continuous high-speed running while racing. Owners found in general use, however, that the oil never achieved the correct [[operating temperature]] because the system was so efficient at cooling the oil. A makeshift solution was devised to deliberately block the oil cooler airflow to boost the oil temperature.\n* The large external reservoir and pumps can be tricky to position around the engine and within the engine bay due to their size.\n* As [[gudgeon pin|wrist pins]] and pistons rely for lubrication and cooling respectively, on the oil being splashed around in the crankcase, these parts might have inadequate oiling if too much oil is pulled away by the pump. Installing piston oilers can circumvent this issue, but do so with additional cost and complexity for the engine.<ref name=\"jpogi\" />\n* Inadequate upper [[valvetrain]] lubrication can also become an issue if too much oil vapor is being pulled out from the area, especially with multi-staged pumps.<ref name=\"jpogi\" />\n\n== Common Engine Applications ==\nDry-sumps are common on larger [[diesel engine]]s such as those used for ship propulsion, largely due to increased reliability and serviceability. They are also commonly used in racing cars and aerobatic aircraft, due to problems with [[g-force]]s, reliable oil supply, power output and vehicle handling.  The Chevrolet Corvette Z06 has a dry sump engine which requires initial oil change after 500 miles.\n\n=== Motorcycle Engines ===\nThe dry-sump lubrication is particularly applicable to motorcycles, which tend to be operated more vigorously than other road vehicles. Although motorcycles such as the [[Honda CB750]] (1969) feature a dry-sump engine, modern motorcycles tend to use a wet-sump design. This is understandable with across-the-frame [[inline-four engine|inline four-cylinder engines]], since these wide engines must be mounted fairly high in the frame (for ground clearance), so the space below may as well be used for a wet-sump. However, narrower engines can be mounted lower and ideally should use dry-sump lubrication.\n\nSeveral motorcycle models that use dry-sumps include;\n* The classic British [[straight-twin engine|parallel twin]] motorcycles, such as [[Birmingham Small Arms Company|BSA]], [[Triumph Engineering|Triumph]] and [[Norton Motorcycle Company|Norton]], all used dry-sump lubrication.

The oil collects in sump (1), is withdrawn continuously by scavenge pump (2) and travels to the oil tank (3), where gases entrained in the oil separate and the oil cools. Gases (6) are returned to the engine sump. Pressure pump (4) forces the de-gassed and cooled oil (5) back to the engine's lubrication points (7).]]\nA '''dry-sump''' system is a method to manage the lubricating [[motor oil]] in [[Four-stroke engine|four-stroke]] and large [[Two-stroke engine|two-stroke]] [[piston]] driven [[internal combustion engine]]s. The dry-sump system uses two or more [[oil pump (internal combustion engine)|oil pumps]] and a separate oil reservoir, as opposed to a conventional [[wet sump|wet-sump]] system, which uses only the main [[sump]] (U.S.: oil pan) below the engine and a single pump. A dry-sump engine requires a pressure relief valve to regulate negative pressure inside the engine, so internal seals are not inverted.\n\nDry-sumps are common on larger [[Diesel engine|diesel engines]] such as those used in ships, as well as gasoline engines used in [[Auto racing|racing cars]], [[Aerobatics|aerobatic aircraft]] and high-performance motorcycles. Dry sump lubrication may be chosen for these applications due to increased reliability, oil capacity, reduction of oil starvation under high [[G-force|g]]-loads and/or other technical or performance reasons. Dry sump systems may not be suitable for all applications due to increased cost, complexity, and/or higher bulkiness, among other factors.\n\n== Mechanism ==\nEngines are both lubricated and cooled by oil that circulates throughout the engine, feeding various [[bearing (mechanical)|bearing]]s and other moving parts and then draining, via gravity, into the sump at the base of the engine. In the wet-sump system of most production [[Car|automobile]] engines, a pump collects this oil from the sump and directly circulates it back through the engine. In a dry-sump, the oil still falls to the base of the engine, however instead of collecting in a reservoir-style oil sump, it falls into a much shallower sump, where one or more scavenge pumps draw it away and transfer it to a (usually external) reservoir, where it is both cooled and [[Degasification|de-aerated]] before being recirculated through the engine by a pressure pump. Dry-sump designs frequently mount the pressure pump and scavenge pumps on a common crankshaft, so that one pulley at the front of the system can run as many pumps as the engine design requires. It is common practice to have one scavenge pump per [[crankcase]] section, however in the case of [[Inline engine (aviation)#Inverted engine|inverted engines]] ([[aircraft engine]]) it is necessary to employ separate scavenge pumps for each [[cylinder bank]]. Therefore, an inverted [[V engine]] would have a minimum of two scavenge pumps and a pressure pump in the pump ''stack''.\n\nThe main purpose of the dry-sump system is to contain all the stored oil in a separate tank, or reservoir. This reservoir is usually tall and round or narrow and specially designed with internal baffles, and an oil outlet (supply) at the very bottom for uninhibited oil supply. The dry-sump oil pump is a minimum of 2 stages, with as many as 5 or 6. One stage is for pressure and is supplied the oil from the bottom of the reservoir, and along with an adjustable pressure regulator, supplies the oil under pressure through the filter and into the engine. The remaining stages \"scavenge\" the oil out of the dry-sump pan and return the oil (and gasses) to the top of the tank or reservoir. If an oil cooler is used usually it is mounted inline between the scavenge outlets and the tank. The dry-sump pump is usually driven by a [[Toothed belt|Gilmer]] or High Torque Drive (HTD) timing belt and pulleys, off the front of the crankshaft, at approximately one half crank speed.  The dry-sump pump is designed with multiple stages to ensure that all the oil is scavenged from the pan and also to allow removal of excess air from the crankcase.<ref name=\"armstrong\">{{cite web|url=http://drysump.com/drysump.htm|title=Technical Description - The Dry Sump System|publisher=Armstrong Race Engineering, Gary Armstrong, DrySump.com, 08-03-2016}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.torquecars.com/tuning/dry-sumps.php|title=Dry Sump|website=TorqueCars|access-date=2016-12-24}}</ref>\n\n==Advantages==\nA dry-sump system offers many advantages over a wet-sump. The primary advantages include:<ref name=\"armstrong\" /><ref>Van Valkenburgh,Paul (1976) ''Race Car Engineering and Mechanics'' Dodd, Mead & Company, p. 181</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.superchevy.com/how-to/engines-drivetrain/camp-1109-dry-sump-oil-system/|title=Dry Sump Oil System - Camaro Performers Magazine|date=2011-09-01|publisher=Super Chevy|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-24}}</ref> \n* Improved engine reliability due to consistent oil pressure. This is the reason why dry-sumps were invented.  \n* Increased oil capacity by using a large external reservoir, that would be impractical in a wet-sump system. \n* Prevention of the engine experiencing oil-starvation during high [[g-force|g]]-loads, which is particularly useful in [[auto racing|racing]] cars, [[high performance vehicle|high performance]] sports cars, and [[aerobatic aircraft]]. Dry-sump designs are not susceptible to the oil movement problems from high cornering forces that wet-sump systems can suffer where the force of the vehicle cornering can cause the oil to pool on one side of the oil pan, possibly uncovering the oil pump pickup tube and causing cavitation and loss of oil pressure. \n* Improvements to vehicle handling and stability. The vehicle's [[center of gravity]] can be lowered by mounting the engine lower in the chassis due to a shallow sump profile. A vehicle's overall [[weight distribution]] can be modified by locating the external oil reservoir away from the engine. \n* Improved oil temperature control. This is due to increased oil volume providing resistance to heat saturation, the positioning of the oil reservoir away from the hot engine, and the ability to include cooling capabilities between the scavenger pumps and oil reservoir and also within the reservoir itself. \n* The ability to release gasses trapped in the oil from [[piston ring|ring]] blow-by and the action of the crankshaft and other moving parts in the oil, then return these gases via a line from the top of the oil reservoir to the combustion chamber. \n* Improved pump efficiency to maintain oil supply to the engine. Since scavenge pumps are typically mounted at the lowest point on the engine, the oil flows into the pump intake by gravity rather than having to be lifted up into the intake of the pump as in a wet-sump. Furthermore, scavenge pumps can be of a design that is more tolerant of entrapped gasses than the typical pressure pump, which can lose suction if too much air mixes into the oil. Since the pressure pump is typically lower than the external oil tank, it always has a positive pressure on its suction regardless of cornering forces. \n* Increased engine horsepower due to reduced viscous and air friction. In a wet-sump engine the crank shaft and other moving parts splash through the oil at thousands of [[revolutions per minute|RPM]]<nowiki/> causing a \"hurricane that whips the oil in a wet-sump engine into an aerated froth like a milkshake in a blender\".<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://rehermorrison.com/tech-talk-84-dry-sumps-dave-lives/|title=Tech Talk #84 \u2013 Dry Sumps Save Lives|last=Reher|first=David|date=2013-06-25|publisher=Reher Morrison Racing Engines|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-24|work=|via=}}</ref> Additionally, in a wet-sump, each revolution generates minute amounts of [[Parastic_load|parasitic power loss]] caused by viscous [[Drag_(physics)|drag]] and air drag (or '[[windage]]') as the parts move rapidly through the oil and air in the lower engine.

A good example is the classic [[Mercedes-Benz 300SL]], a car that was designed for racing but sold to the general public and used on-road. The car had high oil capacity and a dry-sump system to cope with continuous high-speed running while racing. Owners found in general use, however, that the oil never achieved the correct [[operating temperature]] because the system was so efficient at cooling the oil. A makeshift solution was devised to deliberately block the oil cooler airflow to boost the oil temperature.\n* The large external reservoir and pumps can be tricky to position around the engine and within the engine bay due to their size.\n* As [[gudgeon pin|wrist pins]] and pistons rely for lubrication and cooling respectively, on the oil being splashed around in the crankcase, these parts might have inadequate oiling if too much oil is pulled away by the pump. Installing piston oilers can circumvent this issue, but do so with additional cost and complexity for the engine.<ref name=\"jpogi\" />\n* Inadequate upper [[valvetrain]] lubrication can also become an issue if too much oil vapor is being pulled out from the area, especially with multi-staged pumps.<ref name=\"jpogi\" />\n\n== Common Engine Applications ==\nDry-sumps are common on larger [[diesel engine]]s such as those used for ship propulsion, largely due to increased reliability and serviceability. They are also commonly used in racing cars and aerobatic aircraft, due to problems with [[g-force]]s, reliable oil supply, power output and vehicle handling.  The Chevrolet Corvette Z06 has a dry sump engine which requires initial oil change after 500 miles.\n\n=== Motorcycle Engines ===\nThe dry-sump lubrication is particularly applicable to motorcycles, which tend to be operated more vigorously than other road vehicles. Although motorcycles such as the [[Honda CB750]] (1969) feature a dry-sump engine, modern motorcycles tend to use a wet-sump design. This is understandable with across-the-frame [[inline-four engine|inline four-cylinder engines]], since these wide engines must be mounted fairly high in the frame (for ground clearance), so the space below may as well be used for a wet-sump. However, narrower engines can be mounted lower and ideally should use dry-sump lubrication.\n\nSeveral motorcycle models that use dry-sumps include;\n* The classic British [[straight-twin engine|parallel twin]] motorcycles, such as [[Birmingham Small Arms Company|BSA]], [[Triumph Engineering|Triumph]] and [[Norton Motorcycle Company|Norton]], all used dry-sump lubrication. Traditionally, the oil tank was a remote item, but some late-model BSAs, and the Meriden Triumphs, used \"oil-in-the-frame\" designs. \n\n* The [[Yamaha TRX850]] 270-degree parallel twin motorcycle has a dry-sump engine. Its oil reservoir is not remote, but integral to the engine, sitting atop the gearbox.  This design eliminates external oil lines, allowing simpler engine removal and providing faster oil warm up.\n* The [[Yamaha XT660Z T\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9|Yamaha XT660Z]] (and R/X models) use a dry-sump design where the bike's frame tubing is used as the oil reservoir and cooling system<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.yamaha-motor.com.au/products/motorcycle/off-road/adventure/xt660z|title=XT660Z {{!}} Yamaha Motor Australia|website=www.yamaha-motor.com.au|language=en|access-date=2018-05-06}}</ref>\n* The [[Yamaha SR500|Yamaha SR400/500]] uses a dry-sump design where the bike's frame tubing doubles as the oil reservoir and cooling system.<ref name=\"tillston\">{{cite web\n  | title = The iconic SR400, 35 years heritage\n  | publisher = Suzuki Press Release, MCNews.com, 04-11-2013\n  | url = http://www.yamaha-motor.eu/eu/news/index.aspx?id=556871}}</ref>\n* [[Harley-Davidson]] has used dry-sump type lubricating oil systems in their engines since the 1930s.\n* The [[Rotax]] engined [[Aprilia RSV Mille]], and the [[Aprilia RST1000 Futura]] both incorporate a dry-sump, along with sister bikes, the SL1000 Falco and ETV1000 Caponord.\n* The [[Honda XR series|Honda NX650, XR500R, XR600R, XR650R and XR650L]] four-stroke dirt bikes utilize a dry-sump with the oil in the frame tubing.\n* The [[Suzuki DR-Z400]] has a 2L dry-sump with oil in the frame tubing.\n* Chennai built [[Royal Enfield]] prior to 2007.

Introduced in the [[Better Call Saul (season 4)|fourth season]], he is portrayed by [[Tony Dalton]], and was created by [[Vince Gilligan]], [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]] and [[Gordon Smith (screenwriter)|Gordon Smith]].\n\nLalo, a member of the [[Ju\u00e1rez Cartel]], is one of many nephews of drug kingpin [[Hector Salamanca]]. After Hector suffers a stroke, Lalo arrives from Mexico to help run the Salamanca family's drug operation and takes a greater interest in the day-to-day details than Hector did.\n\n== Conception and development ==\n[[File:Tony Dalton (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Tony Dalton]]\n[[Tony Dalton]] made his first on-screen appearance as Lalo Salamanca in the fourth season episode \"[[Coushatta (Better Call Saul)|Coushatta]]\". The character was first mentioned in the ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' episode \"[[Better Call Saul (Breaking Bad)|Better Call Saul]]\", which also referenced the character \"Ignacio\" ([[Nacho Varga]]) and introduced the character [[Saul Goodman]] (Jimmy McGill).<ref name=\"bustle\" /> Prior to the show's airing, [[Vince Gilligan]] mentioned in an interview that the writers had envisioned Lalo to become a major character, acknowledging that, like on ''Breaking Bad'', they must \"keep close tabs on what our characters have done in the past and make good use of it here in the present and the future.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2015/02/vince-gilligan-better-call-saul/ |title=Vince Gilligan Gives Us a Glimpse of Where Better Call Saul Is Headed |last=Tannenbaum |first=Rob |date=February 5, 2015 |website=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200309081417/https://www.wired.com/2015/02/vince-gilligan-better-call-saul/ |archive-date=March 9, 2020 |access-date=March 9, 2020}}</ref> However, Gilligan and [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]] had difficulties in figuring in how to introduce the character properly. They considered him as a [[bogeyman]] around the second season when they started writing narrative to support the need for Lalo's introduction, but had not figured out the character's personality or other motivations. Gilligan believes this was more his fault for delaying on developing Lalo, as it was Gould that pushed on the need to introduce Lalo sooner into the story. Gould saw that Lalo needed to be different from the other Salamancas and a equal foil for [[Gus Fring]], which lead to the casting of Dalton for the role who had the charisma, charm and athleticism they felt they needed for Lalo.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-features/better-call-saul-season-5-finale-creators-interview-984340/ |title=5 Burning Questions About the \u2018Better Call Saul\u2019 Season 5 Finale&nbsp;\u2014 Answered |last=Sepinwall |first=Alan |authorlink=Alan Sepinwall |date=April 20, 2020 |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200421083848/https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-features/better-call-saul-season-5-finale-creators-interview-984340/ |archive-date=April 21, 2020 |access-date=April 20, 2020}}</ref> In an interview with ''[[Den of Geek]]'', [[Michael Mando]] (who portrays Nacho) described the character of Lalo as \"a Salamanca in every way, just like [[Tuco Salamanca|Tuco]] and [[Hector Salamanca|Hector]] had their own flavors to the erratic Salamancas.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/tv/better-call-saul/275809/better-call-saul-season-4-nachos-dark-path |title=Better Call Saul Season 4: Nacho's Dark Path |last=Kurland |first=Daniel |date=August 21, 2018 |website=[[Den of Geek]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200309081528/https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/better-call-saul-season-4-nachos-dark-path/ |archive-date=March 9, 2020 |access-date=March 9, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe episode \"[[Wiedersehen]]\", written by [[Gennifer Hutchison]], fleshes out Lalo further.

Introduced in the [[Better Call Saul (season 4)|fourth season]], he is portrayed by [[Tony Dalton]], and was created by [[Vince Gilligan]], [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]] and [[Gordon Smith (screenwriter)|Gordon Smith]].\n\nLalo, a member of the [[Ju\u00e1rez Cartel]], is one of many nephews of drug kingpin [[Hector Salamanca]].

The character was first mentioned in the ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' episode \"[[Better Call Saul (Breaking Bad)|Better Call Saul]]\", which also referenced the character \"Ignacio\" ([[Nacho Varga]]) and introduced the character [[Saul Goodman]] (Jimmy McGill).<ref name=\"bustle\" /> Prior to the show's airing, [[Vince Gilligan]] mentioned in an interview that the writers had envisioned Lalo to become a major character, acknowledging that, like on ''Breaking Bad'', they must \"keep close tabs on what our characters have done in the past and make good use of it here in the present and the future.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2015/02/vince-gilligan-better-call-saul/ |title=Vince Gilligan Gives Us a Glimpse of Where Better Call Saul Is Headed |last=Tannenbaum |first=Rob |date=February 5, 2015 |website=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200309081417/https://www.wired.com/2015/02/vince-gilligan-better-call-saul/ |archive-date=March 9, 2020 |access-date=March 9, 2020}}</ref> However, Gilligan and [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]] had difficulties in figuring in how to introduce the character properly. They considered him as a [[bogeyman]] around the second season when they started writing narrative to support the need for Lalo's introduction, but had not figured out the character's personality or other motivations. Gilligan believes this was more his fault for delaying on developing Lalo, as it was Gould that pushed on the need to introduce Lalo sooner into the story. Gould saw that Lalo needed to be different from the other Salamancas and a equal foil for [[Gus Fring]], which lead to the casting of Dalton for the role who had the charmisa, charm and athletism they felt they needed for Lalo.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-features/better-call-saul-season-5-finale-creators-interview-984340/ |title=5 Burning Questions About the \u2018Better Call Saul\u2019 Season 5 Finale&nbsp;\u2014 Answered |last=Sepinwall |first=Alan |authorlink=Alan Sepinwall |date=April 20, 2020 |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200421083848/https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-features/better-call-saul-season-5-finale-creators-interview-984340/ |archive-date=April 21, 2020 |access-date=April 20, 2020}}</ref> In an interview with ''[[Den of Geek]]'', [[Michael Mando]] (who portrays Nacho) described the character of Lalo as \"a Salamanca in every way, just like [[Tuco Salamanca|Tuco]] and [[Hector Salamanca|Hector]] had their own flavors to the erratic Salamancas.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/tv/better-call-saul/275809/better-call-saul-season-4-nachos-dark-path |title=Better Call Saul Season 4: Nacho's Dark Path |last=Kurland |first=Daniel |date=August 21, 2018 |website=[[Den of Geek]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200309081528/https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/better-call-saul-season-4-nachos-dark-path/ |archive-date=March 9, 2020 |access-date=March 9, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe episode \"[[Wiedersehen]]\", written by [[Gennifer Hutchison]], fleshes out Lalo further.

He was [[Rector (ecclesiastical)#Roman Catholic Church|rector]] of [[St Francis Xavier Church, Liverpool|St Francis Xavier\u2019s, Liverpool]], from 1935 to 1937. He was [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bombay|Archbishop of Bombay, India]], from 1937 to 1950 but in practice did not exercise this role after 1946 when he absented himself from the post and left his Indian [[auxiliary bishop]] effectively in charge. In 1950 he was appointed [[Titular bishop#Roman Catholic Church|titular Archbishop]] of Sugdaea, modern [[Sudak]].\n\nAfter leaving Bombay, not having a regular diocesan job, he dedicated himself to lecturing, writing, and the promotion of debate on controversial issues. He held that to be effective, authority had to be accepted, not imposed. This required that it be subject to open criticism, scrutiny and review, procedures which he felt were somewhat lacking in the governance of the Church.

Thomas was the second son and seventh child of eventually nine children.<ref name=\"Oxford\"/> His father was from an Irish Protestant family of French Huguenot extraction.<ref name=\"Tablet Obit\"/> Before Thomas was born, the family had lived in [[Liverpool]], England,<ref name=\"Catholic Times 1937\">{{cite news| title =Mother and Sister See Archbishop Roberts Consecrated | work=Catholic Times |date=24 September 1937}}</ref> then in the [[West Indies]], where William did [[consular assistance]] before retiring in ill-health.<ref name=\"Oxford\"/> The family then settled in Le Havre where William became an export merchant. The family moved to [[Arcachon]] and Thomas went to the [[:fr:\u00c9cole Saint-Elme| College of St Elme]], a Dominican boarding school. The school had a nautical bias which had a lasting influence on Thomas's thought processes. In 1900 his father became a Roman Catholic.<ref>Hurn p 9</ref> \n\nIn 1901 his father died and the family moved back to Liverpool, where Thomas went to Parkfield School, a non-Catholic private school.<ref name=\"Oxford\"/> However, by 1908 he was considering the Catholic priesthood and asked to be transferred to [[St Francis Xavier's College, Liverpool|St Francis Xavier's College]] a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] school. On 7 September 1909, he entered the Jesuit [[noviciate]] at [[Parkstead House#Manresa House|Manresa House]], Roehampton.<ref name=\"Tablet Obit\" /> He studied philosophy at [[Stonyhurst St Mary's Hall]]. In 1916 he was sent to [[Preston Catholic College]] for teaching practice. In 1922 he went to [[St Beuno's Jesuit Spirituality Centre|St Beuno's College]], [[St Asaph]], N Wales where he studied theology. He was ordained there on 20 September 1925, aged 32.<ref>Hurn pp 10-11</ref>\n\nAfter ordination, Roberts had spells teaching back at Preston College, then at [[Beaumont College]], [[Old Windsor]], Berkshire, where he set up a branch of the [[Catholic Evidence Guild]], with 33 speakers at pitches in four dioceses. His [[tertianship]] was at [[Paray-le-Monial]] in the [[Sa\u00f4ne-et-Loire]] [[Departments of France|department]], followed by another six years, 1929-1935, teaching at Preston College. In early 1935 he became the youngest Jesuit rector in the country when he was appointed rector of St Francis Xavier's, Liverpool.{{efn|Coincidentally, his parents had married there.<ref name=\"Catholic Times 1937\"/>}} St Francis Xavier's was one of the largest parishes in England, in a inner-city area, with high unemployment and clashes between Catholics from Southern Ireland and Protestants from Northern Ireland.<ref>Hurn pp 11-12</ref>  \n\nOn 3 August 1937 he learned he had been named Archbishop of Bombay when a journalist from the ''Liverpool Post'' asked him for a comment on his appointment.<ref name=\"Oxford\"/> Years later, in retirement, he insisted his appointment had resulted from a bureaucratic blunder on the part of a Vatican official.<ref name=Kaiser>{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=WKzlFLeNLLoC&pg=PA120&lpg=PA121 | page= 121 | title = Clerical Error: A True Story | first = Robert Blair | last= Kaiser | author-link= Robert Blair Kaiser | date= 2002 | publisher =A&C Black | accessdate= 14 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Archbishop of Bombay==\n[[Mumbai|Bombay]] was ceded by the Portuguese to England in 1661 as part of the dowry of [[Catherine of Braganza]] on her marriage to [[King Charles II of England|King Charles II]]. Ever since then there had been difficulties between the Portuguese on the one side and the English and the [[Holy See|Vatican]] on the other side over the administration of the Catholic Church in India in general and the appointment of the Archbishop of Bombay in particular. The Vatican had set up the [[Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples|Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith]] (known for short by the Latin word ''Propaganda'') to be responsible for missionary areas such as India. However, the Portuguese claimed that the ''[[Padroado]]'' (by which the Vatican had, beginning in the 15th century, delegated to the kings of Portugal the administration of local churches in the Portuguese sphere of influence) gave them that right in those territories in perpetuity even where Portugual had ceded control. In 1928 it was agreed under a [[concordat]] between the Vatican and the English and Portuguese Catholic hierarchies that the post of Archbishop of Bombay would be held alternately by a Portuguese and an English Jesuit. There was no provision for an Indian. The first ordinary appointed under the concordat was a Portuguese, Archbishop Joachim Lima, S.J. He died on 21 July 1936 and [[Pope Pius XI]] appointed Roberts on 12 August 1937.<ref>Hurn pp 29-33</ref><ref>''Black Popes'', p viii</ref>\n\nRoberts received his episcopal consecration on 21 September 1937 from the Archbishop of Liverpool, [[Richard Downey]]. Co-consecrators were the Archbishop of Cardiff, [[Francis Mostyn (archbishop of Cardiff)|Francis Mostyn]], who had ordained Roberts, and the [[Vicar General]] of Liverpool archdiocese, Robert Dobson.<ref name=\"Catholic Times 1937\"/> Over 100 priests attended and the congregation of over 1000 spilled out into the street for a service which lasted over three hours, a tribute to someone who 2\u00bd years previously was an obscure lower form master at Preston College.<ref name=\"Catholic Herald 1937\">{{cite news | title = Crowds at Liverpool Ceremony |work=Catholic Herald |date=24 September 1937}}</ref>\n\nAs his episcopal motto Roberts chose ''Carior libertas'', \"Freedom is more precious\", from the motto of the Irish branch of his family, the d'Esterres, ''Patria cara, carior libertas'': \"My country is precious, but freedom is more precious\".<ref name=\"Catholic Herald 1937\"/>\n\nShortly afterwards, Roberts left Liverpool for Bombay. On the way, he spent two weeks in Lisbon in an attempt to lessen the tensions that still existed between the two hierarchies.<ref name=\"Examiner 6 Feb 1954\">{{cite news | title=Farewell to Archbishop Roberts |work= The [Bombay] Examiner |date=6 February 1954}}</ref> He saw the Prime Minister, [[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar|Dr Salazar]], and [[Manuel Gon\u00e7alves Cerejeira|Cardinal Cerejeira]], the first time a non-Portuguese archbishop had made contact with the Portuguese authorities.<ref name=\"Tablet Obit\"/> He arrived in Bombay on 1 December 1937.<ref>''From the Bridge'', pp1,7</ref>\n\nThe Catholic archdiocese of Bombay was the largest in India, and stretched from Baroda (modern name [[Vadodara]]), [[Gujarat]] state, about 300 miles north of Bombay, to the village of [[Korlai Fort|Korlai]], in [[Maharashtra]] state, about 50 miles south. There were 68 parishes with 140,000 members predominantly among the poorer sector. There were 121 [[secular clergy]], 66 Jesuits, and three [[Salesians of Don Bosco|Salesians]]. It had a college of higher education, [[St. Xavier's College, Mumbai|Xavier\u2019s]], the largest in Bombay and later to become a constituent of [[University of Mumbai|Bombay University]], 25 high schools and 88 middle and primary schools.<ref>Aguiar, p 69</ref> \n\nOverlapping and cutting across the ''Padroado''/''Propaganda'' division was a further division based on place of origin: indigenous Bombay Indians, immigrants from Catholic centres such as [[Goa]], [[Mangalore]], [[Chennai|Madras]], and [[Malabar region|Malabar]], as well as Europeans and Anglo-Indians. All were deeply suspicious and jealous of each other.<ref>Aguiar, p 68</ref> Roberts exploited his relationship-building with the Portuguese by rationalising the parish structures with the help of the Portuguese [[Consul|Consul General]].<ref name=\"Examiner 6 Feb 1954\"/>\n\nParticularly controversial was his decision to abolish the parish of Our Lady of  Esperance{{efn|Also known as Nossa Senhora da Esperan\u00e7a, easily confused with others with this name of which there were many in India.}} at [[Bhuleshwar]]. This had been the cathedral parish since 1887 but the church was a vast, expensive to maintain building in an area by then devoid of Catholics.<ref>Aguiar, p 78</ref>  He sold the land and used the proceeds to build churches in the suburbs where the Catholics then lived. He adopted the Church of the Holy Name, the parish church on the harbour, as his pro-cathedral, later to become the [[Cathedral of the Holy Name, Mumbai]]. He broke with tradition by appointing not a Jesuit but a Goan, Fr [[Valerian Gracias]], as its first secular rector.<ref>Hurn p 36</ref> This was part of a policy of steady Indianisation of the clergy, which Roberts adopted with the blessing of his Jesuit superiors, and which was virtually complete in the archdiocese by 1945.<ref>Hurn p 42</ref>\n\nRoberts worked on improving the unity of the archdiocese by a series of letters to the children of his diocese, published in ''[[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bombay#Media|The Examiner]]'', his diocesan newspaper.<ref name=\"Tablet Obit\"/>{{efn|Many of these were later published in ''From the Bridge'', the title of which was a reference to Roberts's nautical interests.<ref>Hurn pp 37-38</ref>}} He put in place a wide range of social services particularly for the poor, orphans, and prostitutes much of it paid for by fund-raising carried out by the children in response to his appeals to them through ''The Examiner'', many catalogued in ''From the Bridge''. He set up centres where seamen could stay while in port. In 1941 he overcame stiff opposition orchestrated by Bombay University's Professor of Economics and member of the Senate [[K. T. Shah]] and established the university's Sophia College for women.<ref>University of Mumbai, list of colleges, http://mu.ac.in/portal/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Updated-All-College-List-with-Course-Detailss.pdf</ref><ref name=\"Oxford\"/> This was for Christians and non-Christians alike. He later had to overcome attempts by Shah in 1942 and again in 1943 to have the college disaffiliated from the university. The senate rejected the 1942 proposal but passed the 1943 proposal. After mass protests in Bombay the decision was overturned by the Government of Bombay which had the final say on Senate decisions.<ref>Aguiar, pp 78-79</ref>  \n\nIn 1939 [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi's]] [[Indian National Congress|Congress Party]] proposed to introduce [[Alcohol prohibition in India|prohibition]]. Roberts, in an address to the [[Rotary International|Rotary Club]], subsequently broadcast on All India Radio, argued that it would not succeed unless the Indian people were solidly behind it, which he was unconvinced was the case. Although his view received wide approval, it brought him into conflict with Gandhi, who drew a parallel between the state provision of drinking facilities and the state provision of women for prostitution.<ref>Aguiar, p 75, quoting from Gandhi's publication [[Harijan#Mohandas Gandhi's publication|Harijan]]</ref>\n\nDuring [[World War II]] Roberts was appointed [[Bishopric of the Forces in Great Britain|Bishop Delegate]] to [[British Armed Forces|H.M. Armed Forces]] in the [[India Command|Indian]] and [[South East Asia Command|South East Asia]] Commands. As his American counterpart was unable to fly he also ministered to American service personnel. This involved flights of over 2000 miles (each way) in service planes to where the troops were, in [[Assam]], [[Myanmar|Burma]] and as far as the Chinese border, and meant he could be away for months at a time.<ref>Aguiar, p 80</ref><ref name=\"Dayton\">{{cite press release |title=Archbishop Thomas d'Esterre Roberts, S.J. to Open Religion in Life Series| date= 13 October 1969 |publisher= University of Dayton | url= https://ecommons.udayton.edu/news_rls/3531 | accessdate= 10 October 2018}}</ref> This was not without risk, and he was involved in two crash-landings, one when the undercarriage jammed, the other when an engine failed in mid-flight. For this work he received the [[Kaisar-i-Hind Medal|Kaisar-i-Hind gold medal]], probably its last recipient. There was a particular problem with the presence in India of religious communities from the Axis powers, particularly German and Italian Catholic nuns. The [[British Raj|British colonial rulers]] invited Roberts, as the only British prelate in India, to sit on the commission set up to deal with them.<ref>Hurn pp 42-44</ref>\n\nWith India moving towards independence, Roberts saw that it would be untenable to keep the system whereby Indian Catholics were governed alternately by a British and a Portuguese archbishop. In May 1945 he visited Pope Pius XII in Rome and proposed that the 1928 concordat be terminated, followed by his demitting his post as archbishop. If he simply resigned he would be succeeded by a Portuguese, not an Indian. To get round this, Roberts planned to appoint an Indian auxiliary bishop, ostensively with a view to proving that Indians were perfectly capable of running their own affairs. An auxiliary bishop had no right of succession (so the Portuguese could not object) but might in practice succeed, especially once India was independent. While accepting Roberts's plan in principle, the Pope asked for an explicit undertaking from Roberts that he would not drop the title of Archbishop of Bombay. Roberts returned to India to manage the transfer of his responsibilities to the auxiliary bishop. On 16 May 1946 Gracias was appointed and Roberts consecrated him on 29 June 1946.<ref>Hurn pp 44-47</ref> Roberts then left for England on an oil tanker, the ''British Aviator''.<ref>Aguiar, p 81</ref>\n\nSo long as the Portuguese insisted on their rights, Roberts could neither resign nor drop his title. As a result he could not take up another permanent appointment. His arrangement with Pius XII required him to be out of Bombay (at sea or in America) to leave any possible successor a free hand, but with the possibility of returning to Bombay if necessary.<ref>Statement by Roberts, as a postcript to Aguiar, p 81</ref> Thanks to some friends in the [[British Tanker Company]], part of what is now [[BP]], he spent a period as a temporary chaplain of the [[Apostleship of the Sea]], working on oil tankers. He spent some time in India again in 1947/1948 after being ordered back by the Vatican by mistake. He left again in August 1948 by signing on as a crew member of an oil tanker in Bombay harbour, leaving his auxiliary in complete charge.<ref>Hurn pp 47-48</ref> \n\nEventually Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru|Nehru]] of the now Republic of India called for an end to the remains of colonisation. ''Padroado'' and the 1928 Concordat were terminated on 18 July 1950<ref>Hurn p 49</ref> and Roberts's resignation was finally accepted in December 1950. He was succeeded by Gracias, later to become the first Indian cardinal.<ref name=\"Gracias Obit\">{{cite news| title=Archbishop T. D.

However, the announcement that he was ill did not help Roberts in his quest for a new position, even a temporary one.<ref>Hurn p 49</ref> Talk of other full-time episcopal appointments perhaps in [[Guyana]] or the [[West Indies]] came to nothing.<ref name=\"Tablet Obit\"/> He resumed life as a Jesuit in the English province and dedicated himself to lecturing and writing. He gave retreats for a time at [[Loyola Hall]], Rainhill, Merseyside. In 1951 he became Spiritual Father at [[Campion Hall]], University of Oxford. From 1954 he was based at the [[Church of the Immaculate Conception, Farm Street#Mount Street Centre|Mount Street Jesuit Centre]], London. He travelled a great deal, visiting Jesuit institutions and giving retreats in Scotland, England, Germany, and the USA, including periods on the staff of [[Gonzaga University]] in Spokane, Washington, from May 1958 to September 1959 and for another six months in 1960. He retained his war-time connection with the US military, visiting US troops in [[Allied-occupied Germany]].<ref name=\"Dayton\"/> He also twice visited Bombay at the invitation of Cardinal Gracias.<ref>Hurn p 52</ref> \n\nHe promoted debate on issues about which he felt strongly despite their discussion being unpopular with many in the Catholic hierarchy: how authority was exercised in the church and the right, indeed duty, to ask questions of those in authority; the importance of exercising an informed conscience; the Church's stance on contraception<ref name=\"Tablet Obit\"/> and peace, nuclear war and the right to conscientious objection.<ref name=\"Pax Obit\">{{cite news|title=Archbishop Roberts: A [Pax Christi] Friend's Tribute | work= Catholic Herald | date= 5 March 1976}}</ref>\n\n==Writings on authority==\nIn 1954 he wrote ''Black Popes: Authority its Use and Abuse''{{efn|\"Black Pope\" is a popular title given to the [[Superior General of the Society of Jesus|General of the Society of Jesus]].}}{{efn|[[Kirkus Reviews]] thought he wrote in response to ''[[American Freedom and Catholic Power]]'' (1949) by [[Paul Blanshard]].<ref>{{cite web |publisher= Kirkus Reviews|  url = https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/t-d-roberts/black-popes-authority-its-use-and-abuse/ | title = Black Popes: Authority its use and abuse | quote = ...prompted, we feel sure, by attacks on Catholic authoritarianism such as American Freedom and Catholic Power. }}</ref>}}  in which he argued that \"blind obedience\" was harmful and that effective authority requires responsibility, openness, and unhindered two-way communication. Failing this, authority is liable to become abuse. Because of the danger of abuse, obedience to authority should not be out of fear but \"intelligent\" i.e. questioning and reasoned: he drew an analogy to the non-Catholic's appeal to conscience. \n\nHe also criticised the bureaucratic process in the church's marital courts and called for greater involvement of the laity in church affairs.<ref>''Black Popes'' pp 4-33</ref>\n\nIn April 1961 he followed this up with \"Naked Power: Authority in the Church Today\", a paper delivered to a symposium on ''Problems of Authority'' held at the [[Bec Abbey|Abbey of Our Lady of Bec]], Normandy.<ref>Hurn p 68 et seq</ref> In a quote from ''Black Popes'' he took issue with the discouragement of criticism to higher authority in the church: such questioning was regarded as treason<ref>Hurn p 69</ref>, heresy or rebellion<ref>Hurn p 74</ref>, whereas Roberts regarded it as a duty.<ref>Hurn pp 77-82</ref> He pointed out that there were many instances in the ''[[Acts of the Apostles]]'' of open disagreements between Christ's disciples.<ref>''Black Popes'' p 5</ref> He went on to criticise ecclesiastical proceedings under [[Canon Law]]. These could be done in secret with anonymous witnesses, without the accused being told the charges, without a hearing and with no acknowledgement of any defence; furthermore, those carrying them out could have no training except spiritual<ref>Hurn p 70</ref> and little knowledge or experience of the world outside the religious.<ref>''Black Popes'' p 5</ref>\n\n==Association with peace movement==\nRoberts was not a pacifist: he believed in a just war and the right to self-defence against those who were \"mad or bad\".<ref>Hurn pp 65-66 </ref> He was in favour of World War I and was embarrassed that his being a clerical student exempted him from call-up.<ref>Hurn p 10</ref> While supporting the ''right'' to conscientious objection, his position, explained while Archbishop of Bombay in an interview broadcast on [[All India Radio]] and rebroadcast by the [[BBC]], was \"a point must be reached when the choice lay between repelling violence by violence or of handing over our children to be indoctrinated to violence\".<ref>Hurn p 43</ref> However, the advent of nuclear weapons, which could indiscriminately affect non-combatant countries, caused him to questioned the morality of a future war.<ref>Hurn p 67</ref>\n\nWhile chaplain to the forces in India, Roberts had seen at first hand the human misery and material loss caused by war. He began to associate himself with peace groups \u2013 the [[Quakers]], the [[Fellowship of Reconciliation]], and the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] (\"CND\") \u2013 and became a trustee of [[Amnesty International]].<ref>Hurn pp53, 162</ref> In 1959, when lecturing at Gonzaga University, he took part in an inter-faith conference in the city on peace, fundamental human rights and the morality (or otherwise) of governments involving citizens wholesale in nuclear war.<ref>''Objections'' pp 185-186</ref> He became a sponsor of Pax, a Catholic society for peace which subsequently merged with [[Pax Christi]], and in October of that year he addressed a Pax meeting held at [[Armitage Park|Spode House]] (also known as Hawkesyard Hall).{{efn| Spode House, Armitage, near Rugeley, Staffordshire, was the first Roman Catholic conference centre in Great Britain.}}<ref name=\"Pax Obit\"/>\n\nHe refused to join the [[Committee of 100 (United Kingdom)|Committee of 100]], a British anti-war group, as he did not believe in civil disobedience. He did, however, agree to appear for the defence at the trial in 1962 of the [[Committee of 100 (United Kingdom)#1962-1968|Wethersfield Six]] who were prosecuted after 5,000 protesters occupied the runway at an RAF base to prevent planes taking off. In the event, the key question that he was asked by defence counsel on whether nuclear weapons were immoral was ruled of out of order by the judge.<ref>Hurn p 64</ref>\n\nIn July 1963, Roberts published an article in ''Continuum'', an American Catholic review, entitled \"The Arms Race and Vatican II\".{{efn|The article was re-printed in the book ''Objections to Roman Catholicism.''<ref>''Objections'', pp 182 et seq</ref>}} In it he developed [[Pope John XXIII]]'s statement on nuclear non-proliferation in his 11 April 1963 [[encyclical#Catholic usage|encyclical]] ''On Establishing Universal Peace in Truth, Justice, Charity and Liberty'' (''[[Pacem in Terris]]'') that \" \u2026 if any government does not acknowledge the rights of man, or violates them, it not only fails in its duty, but its orders completely lack juridical force.\"<ref>Quoted in ''Objections'', pp 183</ref> Given that in a nuclear war there was likely to be accidental destruction of non-participating countries Roberts concluded that nuclear warfare was not morally lawful.\n\nIn a \"question and answer\" session with the American (Catholic) Pax society (published in their autumn 1964 newsletter, ''Peace'')<ref>Extracts quoted in Hurn pp 61-67</ref> Roberts said that most bishops on both sides during the recent war justified supporting their governments on grounds of obedience to the authority of the state. Noting that this was rejected at the Nuremberg trials Roberts argued that the \"individual has a fundamental right to freely follow his own conscience\" and that \"conscientious abstention\" (his preferred phrase) was a human right.\n\nIn March 1968 Roberts joined a small group praying outside the American Embassy in London for [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War#1968|an end to the Vietnam War]] and for the right of conscientious objection. He later accompanied them to a meeting in the embassy. This attracted some attention in the press because earlier in the month 10,000 had rallied in Trafalgar Square and their march on the embassy had turned into a riot with 86 injured and 200 arrests.<ref>{{cite news| title=Protests |first= John |last=Short |work=Catholic Pictorial | date= 31 March 1968}}</ref>\n\n==Delation to Rome==\nIn May 1960, while he was still at Gonzaga University, Roberts first heard of charges against him in a letter from Archbishop [[Gerald O'Hara|O'Hara]], then [[Apostolic Delegate]] to Great Britain, in London. The process was described as \"delation\",<ref name=\"Catholic Encyclopedia\">{{cite book|chapter=Roberts, Thomas d'Esterre |last= O'Hare | first = J.A. |title=New Catholic Encyclopedia | date=2003 | publisher = The Gale Group Inc. | url = http://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/roberts-thomas-desterre |author-link=Joseph A.

O'Hara also accused him of revealing, at that Pax conference, \"the secrets of the [[Second Vatican Council|[Second Vatican] Council]]\" in that he had disclosed his reply to a request from Cardinal [[Domenico|Tardini]] for suggestions for the agenda.{{efn|Tardini, as Cardinal Secretary of State, had written to all bishops soliciting items for discussion at the Council}}\n\nO'Hara also alleged that Roberts had written a letter published in ''The Universe'' attacking the English bishops on their implementation of the Pope's wishes on sacred music and the liturgy.\n\nO'Hara then quoted in full a letter from Cardinal [[Marcello Mimmi|Mimmi]], Secretary of the [[Congregation for Bishops#History|Sacred Consistorial Congregation for Bishops]] which said in essence that Roberts should keep silent in future. O'Hara had already sent copies of the proceedings to four curial Roman departments{{efn|These were the [[Congregation for Bishops|Consistorial Congregation]], the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith|Holy Office]], the [[Section for Relations with States (Roman Curia)|Congregation of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs]], and the [[Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life|Congregation of Religious]].<ref>Hurn p 100</ref>}} and to the Secretary General of the Jesuits.\n\nIn reply, Roberts refuted the charges and complained that the allegations had been heard, judgement given and punitive action taken before the accused even knew he had been charged.\n\nOn the specific charges, he was unaware of any ban on Pax by Griffin, and the relevant conference at Spode, \"an irreproachable venue\", was advertised in Catholic newspapers. His letter to Tardini did not suggest what the Council might discuss. He had merely asked for an extra-conciliar examination of an issue that troubled the consciences of many people, namely personal decisions about participation in nuclear war.{{efn|In any case, while communications from the Vatican were confidential, bishops were free to publicise their replies and many did, including Roberts at the Spode conference.}} Finally, Roberts challenged O'Hara to produce the letter he was supposed to have written to The Universe attacking the English hierarchy.{{efn|The point was that he had written no such letter.}}\n\nRoberts said that he would ask the Vatican for a full investigation of the charges. If found true he would accept the punishment; if false he would expect his innocence to be given as much publicity as the allegations of guilt had already been given without his knowledge.\n\nThree months later, O'Hara wrote again to tell Roberts that his book ''Black Popes'' (published 6 years previously) had been discussed at a plenary session of the Holy Office. The Holy Office had issued a decree that \"scandalous\" portions of the book be omitted or modified in subsequent editions and asked for confirmation of execution of the decree. Roberts wrote back on 5 September 1960 to say that there was no question of new editions at present. On his informing his publishers they had asked which passages had caused offence: no detail had been given other than that the offending material was in chapters 6 and 7. These dealt respectively with the succession and controversial reign of [[Pope Boniface VIII]] (1294-1303){{efn|Roberts was later to devote a chapter of his book ''Diary of Bathsheeba'' to criticising Boniface's actions.<ref>''Diary...'' chapter 2, pp 23-35</ref>}} and the suppression of the Society of Jesus by [[Pope Clement XIV]] for political reasons in 1773. Roberts pointed out that the condemnation of ''Black Popes'' could embarrass the Pope as the book's Spanish edition had an ''imprimatur'' and there had been many positive reviews of the book in the Catholic press.{{efn|[[Yves Congar]], who became a key figure at the Second Vatican Council, noted in his diary in 1961 that Roberts had not been ordered to withdraw his criticisms of contemporary church governance, \"and those are the pages to which he himself is most attached\".<ref>{{cite book | accessdate = 14 October 2018 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=MlIYG3_oaM4C&pg=PA45 | page=45 | title = My Journal of the Council | first= Yves | last= Congar | author-link= Yves Congar | date= 2012 | publisher = Liturgical Press}}</ref>}} \n\nRoberts posited that bishops owed to the church a standard of justice higher than any in the world,<ref>''Black Popes'' p 6</ref> for example England where justice had to be \"done and seen to be done\". In order to illustrate his case to the Pope, he obtained the opinions of two experienced lawyers, including an authority on criminal libel, as to the likely outcome of a hypothetical referral to the English courts. He intended then to use his own case as a good example of what was wrong with proceedings under Canon Law. Both lawyers independently advised that the actions of Archbishop O'Hara in the letter of May 1960 and the condemnation of passages in ''Black Popes'' would, in the English courts, be regarded as defamatory. Although O'Hara could claim that his communications were covered by privilege, that claim would be defeated because there was evidence, for example the absence of due process, of malice on the part of O'Hara. This would render O'Hara liable in an action for libel and could give rise to a criminal prosecution.\n\nRoberts saw [[Pope John XXIII]] on 6 December 1960. The Pope undertook to open an enquiry into the affair. Despite sending reminders Roberts heard nothing further; eventually Cardinal [[Amleto Giovanni Cicognani|Cicognani]], Cardinal Secretary of State and President of the Co-ordinating Commission of the Vatican Council told Roberts in December 1962 that Roberts's hearing nothing meant vindication and there would be no bar to his attending the Council. The Pope, who had been seriously ill for some time, died on 3 June 1963. O'Hara died a month later. Roberts let the matter rest but he remained troubled by it because it was a matter of truth and conscience.<ref>Hurn chapter nine, pp 94-112;</ref><ref name=\"Oxford\"/><ref name=\"Tablet Obit\"/>\n\n==Position on contraception==\nRoberts gave the inaugural address to the Catholic Medical Guild of St Luke, Bombay, which he had set up in 1938. In this he extolled them to follow \"Christian tradition\" and \"not [to] restrict birth artificially\". He went on to criticise the 1930 [[Lambeth Conference#Seventh: 1930|Lambeth Conference]] for its abandonment of its previous stance against contraception.{{efn|See Resolution 15, The Lambeth Conference, Resolutions Archive from 1930\nhttps://www.anglicancommunion.org/media/127734/1930.pdf}}\n<ref>Aguiar p 73</ref>\n\nIn the early 1960s, questions began to be asked by Cardinal [[Leo Joseph Suenens|Suenens]] and by many others in the Catholic Church about the appropriateness of its ban on contraception.<ref>Hurn p 130</ref> In order to forestall mass discussion of the topic at the Second Vatican Council, Pope John XXIII set up a Pontifical Commission on Birth Control in 1963.<ref name=\"NCR\">{{cite news|title=New birth control commission papers reveal Vatican's hand |last= Slevin |first= Gerald |work=National Catholic Reporter |date= 23 March 2011 | url= https://www.ncronline.org/news/vatican/new-birth-control-commission-papers-reveal-vaticans-hand |accessdate=15 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nInformed by his nine years in India, with its high birth rates and poverty, Roberts, too, had come to question the continued appropriateness of the Catholic traditional approach. He gave an interview to [[Michael de la B\u00e9doy\u00e8re]] for publication in the April 1964 edition of the latter\u2019s magazine ''Search''. In this he admitted that could not understand the Catholic Church's position that contraception was \"unethical\". He could not see how the position taken by the 1958 Lambeth Conference{{efn|This had laid responsibility for deciding the number and frequency of children on the consciences of parents in the context of the resources of the family and the needs of society as a whole.<ref>Resolution 115, The Lambeth Conference, Resolutions Archive from 1958, https://www.anglicancommunion.org/media/127740/1958.pdf</ref>}} could be refuted by reason alone and said that if he were not bound by the Church's ruling he would have accepted it.<ref>''Search'' article is quoted in Hurn pp 131-136 and also in {{cite web| accessdate= 3 October 2018 | url=http://www.catholicsandcontraception.com/pope-and-pill-1968-pyle/ |publisher= [[Wijngaards Institute for Catholic Research]]| title= Pope and Pill}}</ref>\n\nOn 7 May 1964, English bishops led by Archbishop (later Cardinal) [[John Heenan (cardinal)|Heenan]] published in the ''Sunday Times'' a statement quoting [[Pope Pius XI]]'s encyclical letter ''Christian Marriage'', 1930, (''[[Casti connubii]]'') that contraception was \"against the laws of God and of nature\" and that the church \"cannot change God's law\".  In a thinly veiled attack on Roberts they warned of \"false leaders\". Roberts was then in Chicago. The London ''Evening Standard'' drew his attention to the article and asked for a response which it would publish. In it Roberts denied the claim of the English hierarchy that he was \"leading people astray\". He merely represented the views of many in the church in calling for a review. After all, the Church had changed its mind historically about what was and what was not sinful.<ref>Hurn pp 137-143</ref><ref>''Objections'' p 177</ref>\n\nRoberts wrote an expanded version of the ''Search'' paper which was published later in 1964 in ''Objections to Roman Catholicism'' alongside his ''Continuum'' paper on war. At the same time he contributed the introduction to a symposium on ''Contraception and Holiness: the Catholic Predicament''. Roberts argued from his experience seeing the poverty and malnutrition caused by the population explosion in India on the back of improved medical facilities and the failure of the Indian government's attempt to promote the [[Calendar-based contraceptive methods|rhythm method]]. He was also conscious of the divergent attitudes to this question taken by Christian missionaries in India from Catholic and Protestant traditions yet the term \"natural law\" implied something that should be universally recognised. He intended to say so at the Second Vatican Council, which was then in progress. He would urge the Council, as an ecumenical council, to consult widely but specifically to include married couples in order to re-examine the question with a view to clarifying this \"natural law\" and to justifying its case by logical reasoning.<ref>''Objections'' pp 173, 176-180</ref>\n\nIn practice, discussion at the Council was stifled when the Pope, by now John XXIII's successor, [[Pope Paul VI|Paul VI]], announced that the matter was reserved to him.<ref>Hurn p 125</ref> In 1966, after the end of Vatican II but before the Commission reported, during which there was a feeling in the Catholic laity that there might shortly be a relaxation of the ban on contraception, Roberts wrote ''Quaker Marriage: A Dialogue between Conscience and Coercion''. This was a case study about an imaginary couple, the man a devout Quaker, the woman a devout Catholic, who had been told after the difficult birth of their first child that future pregnancies were likely to be fatal for the wife. The paper explored their relationship with each other and with their traditionally-minded parish priest and his more liberal curate. It was published in the symposium ''The Future of Catholic Christianity''.\n\nThe Pontifical Commission reported after the close of the Council, a large majority recommending that the ban on artificial birth control be lifted. This was rejected by the Pope, who accepted a minority report. This admitted that there was no argument in reason why contraception should be condemned, but recommended that the Pope use his authority to maintain the status quo. On 29 July 1968 the Pope issued the encyclical ''[[Humanae Vitae]]'' reaffirming the ban.<ref name=\"NCR\"/> Roberts was reported in the ''New York Times'' as having said that the encyclical \"flies in the face of reality\" and that Catholics no longer raised the use of birth control in the confessional.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Leo |first1=John|title=Takes Note of Opposition; Dissent is Voiced |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1968/07/30/76958013.pdf |accessdate=23 June 2018 |work=New York Times |date=30 July 1968}}</ref>\n\nWhen asked to, Roberts continued to speak on contraception, but was careful never to undermine the papacy or hierarchy tasked with promulgation of the ruling. He stuck to the facts: how the decision was made, the views of bishops in various parts of the world, the views of non-Catholic Christians and of non-Christians,{{efn|The encyclical was addressed \"to all men of good will\".}} that the encyclical was not subject to \"[[Infallibility#Christianity|infallibility]]\", and that popes had made mistakes in the past.<ref>{{cite news| title=Archbishop speaks on the pill |last=Moore |first= Tim |work=Nationalist & Leinster Times |date=19 August 1968}}</ref>\n\n==Involvement with Second Vatican Council==\nRoberts attended the [[Second Vatican Council]] (\"Vatican II\"), held from 1962 to 1965, but he never managed to speak on the council floor.<ref name=\"Tablet Obit\"/> In the second period (autumn 1963), Roberts submitted a paper asking for reform in ecclesiastical procedures affecting marriage and divorce which he claimed were cruel and unnecessarily drawn out.<ref name=\"NYT Obit\"/> \nIn the third period (autumn 1964), in the session on \"The Church in the Modern World\", Roberts submitted a shortened version of his ''Continuum'' paper and asked for Catholic support for conscientious objection to wars that were immoral. He cited the recently publicised case of [[Franz J\u00e4gerst\u00e4tter]] executed by the Germans in World War II.<ref name=\"Pax Obit\"/> He was not called to speak and conscientious objection and the question of obedience that made World War II possible were not discussed.<ref>Hurn p 55</ref> The statement which eventually emerged in  ''[[Gaudium et Spes]]'' fell short of a demand for unilateral nuclear disarmament but left little scope for any real conviction that the use of nuclear weapons could be justified.<ref name=\"Kay Obit\"/>\n\nThis was followed by a session on \"Marriage and the Family\". Roberts applied to speak, submitting a shortened version of his ''Objections'' paper on contraception.<ref>Quoted in Hurn p 128-129</ref> He was not called to speak, but the matter was taken up by other bishops, including Cardinal Suenens who warned \"let us avoid a new Galileo case\".<ref>Hurn p 152</ref> Discussion was curtailed pending the report of the Pontifical Commission.\n\nNot being called to speak at the Council sessions, Roberts took every opportunity to make his views known outside them, for example in press conferences.<ref>Hurn p 126</ref> Referring to a discussion in Council on the guilt of the Jews for deicide, he took the opportunity to return to his theme of the Church's discouragement of criticism: \"It is so plain that the guilt lay not with the Jewish people, but with the Jewish priestly establishment, that it seems legitimate to wonder whether the refusal to face up to this may not be a subconscious reluctance to face up to the analogy in the Church today\".<ref> Thomas Beaudoin, ''Catholics, Jews, and Vatican II: A New Beginning'', quoting from Frederick Franck, ''Exploding Church'' (New York: Delacorte Press, 1968), 230, The Historical Text Archive, http://historicaltextarchive.com/sections.php/sections.php?action=read&artid=76</ref>\n\n==Roberts's attitude to women==\nRoberts's stance on women was that they must not be treated as second-class citizens.<ref name=\"Month Lucas\">Lucas, Barbara, ''Women's Liberator'', ''The Month'', March 1973, pp 108-109</ref> \n\nHe founded Bombay University's Sophia College for women in 1941, 6 years before women were admitted as full members of [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] in England.<ref>University of Cambridge, History, The University after 1945. https://www.cam.ac.uk/about-the-university/history/the-university-after-1945</ref>\n\nWhen Vatican II started women were not admitted (all observers had to be male). When the Quaker observer at the Council, [[:de:Richard Karl Ullmann|Dr Ullmann]], died in August 1963, Roberts suggested that his widow be invited to attend in his stead, but this was not possible. At a press conference he gave on 22 October 1963, during the 2nd session, he complained that \"There are whole classes of Catholics unrepresented at this Council: nuns and other women.\" Women were admitted as observers from the 3rd session (September 1964) onwards.<ref>Allen, John L, Jnr, ''Remembering the women of Vatican II'', ''National Catholic Reporter'', 12 October 2012)</ref>\n\nIn a 1964 interview in the New York Catholic Magazine ''Jubilee'' Roberts complained that the church's attitude to women had hardly changed since [[Old Testament]] times. He pointed out that the views of the early [[Church Fathers]] reflected the views of their time, namely that women were little more than animals and that procreation was the sole purpose of sex in marriage. He went on to criticise professors in seminaries for not emphasising to seminarians that such views were no longer valid.<ref>Hurn p 160</ref>\n\nIn his introduction to ''Contraception and Holiness'', written before the composition of the Pontifical Commission on Birth Control was made public, Roberts echoed Cardinal Suenens's call for a special commission \"composed of laymen and clergy, men ''and women'' [emphasis in original] to study the problem in collaboration with the [Pontifical Commission].\"<ref>''Contraception''  p 23</ref>\n\nIn the run-up to the 1971 [[Synod of Bishops in the Catholic Church|Synod of Bishops]], a Belgian [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] nun, Sr Buisseret, wrote an open letter to the bishops calling for bishops to be able \"to confer on qualified women the exercise of certain ministries hitherto reserved to men, not excluding the priesthood\". This would be \"on an experimental basis\" and \"in certain limited areas of the church\": she instanced missionary areas where priests were in short supply.<ref>Extracts from her letter, which included a discussion of the arguments against female priests, were published in ''The Church in the World: News and Notes from all Parts'', ''The Tablet'', 4 September 1971.</ref> She asked for those who agreed with her proposal to write to her indicating their support. Roberts wrote that his experience as a Jesuit priest for 48 [sic]{{efn|Actually 46}} years and an archbishop for 34 years led him to \"endorse her suggestion without reserve.\"<ref>''Letters to the Editor'', ''The Tablet'', 18 September 1971.</ref><ref name=\"Month Lucas\"/>\n\n==Roberts's unconventionality==\nObedience was an obsession for Roberts and he took his vow of poverty literally, eschewing 1st class travel and wearing handed-down clothes.<ref>Hurn pp 3-5</ref> At the Vatican Council, he stayed in a tiny room and would often receive visitors in a pyjama top and aged shawl over black trousers.<ref>{{cite news|title=Archbishop Thomas d\u2019Esterre Roberts |work=Sunday Times Magazine |date= 5 December 1965}}</ref>\n\nHe disliked ecclesiastical pomp and advocated simplification. He particularly disliked [[Pontifical High Mass]], where he felt that the focus of attention was on the bishop instead of on the service. He disliked the term \"Your Grace\" preferring to be called \"Father\". He disliked fancy lace vestments, likening them to women's underwear, and kept his episcopal ring in his back pocket to discourage people from feeling they were expected to kiss it. He disliked St Peter's Basilica in Rome and told his biographer, Hurn, \"I never feel altogether comfortable in St Peter's. I keep remembering that it was largely built from the sale of indulgences.\" These attitudes gave him an affinity with [[Low Church]] members.<ref>Hurn pp 2-6, 155</ref>\n\nHis experience of working with non-Christian religions in India led him to promote friendships with non-Catholics generally and rapprochement with other Christian denominations in particular.<ref>Hurn pp 2-3</ref> By invitation from [[Michael Ramsey|Archbishop and Mrs Ramsey]], he became the first Roman Catholic prelate to dine at [[Lambeth Palace]] since [[Reginald Pole|Cardinal Pole]], the last Roman Catholic [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], in the 16th century.<ref>Hurn p 154</ref> \n\nHe advised [[Pope Pius XII]] against [[Dogmatic definition|dogmatically defining]] the [[Assumption of Mary]] in 1950<ref name=Kaiser/> and long before Vatican II he was in favour of a relaxation of the ban on [[Cremation in the Christian World#The Roman Catholic Church|cremation]],<ref>Hurn p44</ref> advocated involvement of the laity in church affairs, and associated himself with the Christian anti-racism movement.<ref>Hurn p 155</ref>\n\n==Relationship with the Hierarchy==\nRoberts was unswervingly loyal to the church, but to him loyalty did not include passive acquiescence in the status quo, which he saw as laziness if not cowardice.<ref name=\"Month Corbishley\">Corbishley, Thomas, and Hebblethwaite, Peter, ''One Long Blast on the Whistle'', ''The Month'', March 1973, p 67</ref> His unconventional views, his willingness to challenge authority, and his association with non-Catholic Christians, unsettled some in the Catholic Hierarchy, who shunned him, blocked his activities, and on occasion actively attacked him.<ref name=\"Oxford\"/>\n\nHe was asked to lead the prayers at a interdenominational CND and Christian Action meeting in Trafalgar Square on Remembrance Sunday, 12 November 1961, but [[William Godfrey|Cardinal Godfrey]] forbade him from doing so.<ref>Hurn p 156</ref>\n\nIn 1964, the [[Fellowship of Reconciliation (United States)|Fellowship of Reconciliation]] asked him to make a lecture tour of the US and he took part in many lectures across the US and Canada.

Three days before the lunch he received a note suggesting that he withdraw, which he did. This caused speculation in the press as to who had written the note: Roberts considered himself under a vow of silence. Speculation increased when Archbishop Heenan declined to give an \"on the record\" comment.<ref>{{cite news|title=Archbishop silenced by RC authority |work=Guardian |date= 12 January 1965}}</ref> On the eve of the lunch, Fr Terence Corrigan, head of the Jesuits in England, said that he had asked Roberts to \"reconsider\" his invitation to speak as he felt that the attendance of a well known Jesuit figure on such an occasion would have suggested that the society was somehow in a dispute with the English Catholic hierarchy.<ref>{{cite news| title=Archbishop withdrew for Jesuits |work=Guardian |date= 13 January 1965}}</ref> Roberts then issued a statement which was read at the lunch in which he said, \"\u2026 neither the book as a whole, nor my contribution to it, was intended to be a move against the English Roman Catholic hierarchy.

Aware that there was likely to be unfounded criticism of his talk and misrepresentation of what he said he was very careful to stick to facts, particularly when asked directly for his view on the Scottish bishops' statement on the encyclical ''Humanae Vitae''. Nevertheless, the university chaplain, Fr Ian Gillan, intervened and accused him of publicly insulting the Scottish hierarchy and of encouraging his listeners not to follow their bishops, charges refuted by the chairman of the meeting, Miss Isabel Mageniss.<ref>{{cite news|work=Glasgow Observer |title=Students secretary defends Archbishop Roberts |date=25 October 1968}}</ref>\n\nDespite his being called a \"rogue bishop\" or a \"maverick\" by some, others, particularly among the Jesuits, thought highly enough of him to devote the entire March 1973 issue of ''[[The Month]]'' to a symposium entitled \"Tribute to Archbishop Roberts on his 80th Birthday\".

He was [[Rector (ecclesiastical)#Roman Catholic Church|rector]] of [[St Francis Xavier Church, Liverpool|St Francis Xavier\u2019s, Liverpool]], from 1935 to 1937. He was [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bombay|Archbishop of Bombay, India]], from 1937 to 1950 but in practice did not exercise this role after 1946 when he absented himself from the post and left his Indian [[auxiliary bishop]] effectively in charge. In 1950 he was appointed [[Titular bishop#Roman Catholic Church|titular Archbishop]] of Sugdaea, modern [[Sudak]].\n\nAfter leaving Bombay, not having a regular diocesan job, he dedicated himself to lecturing, writing, and the promotion of debate on controversial issues. He held that to be effective, authority had to be accepted, not imposed. This required that it be subject to open criticism, scrutiny and review, procedures which he felt were somewhat lacking in the governance of the Church.

Thomas was the second son and seventh child of eventually nine children.<ref name=\"Oxford\"/> His father was from an Irish Protestant family of French Huguenot extraction.<ref name=\"Tablet Obit\"/> Before Thomas was born, the family had lived in [[Liverpool]], England,<ref name=\"Catholic Times 1937\">{{cite news| title =Mother and Sister See Archbishop Roberts Consecrated | work=Catholic Times |date=24 September 1937}}</ref> then in the [[West Indies]], where William did [[consular assistance]] before retiring in ill-health.<ref name=\"Oxford\"/> The family then settled in Le Havre where William became an export merchant. The family moved to [[Arcachon]] and Thomas went to the [[:fr:\u00c9cole Saint-Elme| College of St Elme]], a Dominican boarding school. The school had a nautical bias which had a lasting influence on Thomas's thought processes. In 1900 his father became a Roman Catholic.<ref>Hurn p 9</ref> \n\nIn 1901 his father died and the family moved back to Liverpool, where Thomas went to Parkfield School, a non-Catholic private school.<ref name=\"Oxford\"/> However, by 1908 he was considering the Catholic priesthood and asked to be transferred to [[St Francis Xavier's College, Liverpool|St Francis Xavier's College]] a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] school. On 7 September 1909, he entered the Jesuit [[noviciate]] at [[Parkstead House#Manresa House|Manresa House]], Roehampton.<ref name=\"Tablet Obit\" /> He studied philosophy at [[Stonyhurst St Mary's Hall]]. In 1916 he was sent to [[Preston Catholic College]] for teaching practice. In 1922 he went to [[St Beuno's Jesuit Spirituality Centre|St Beuno's College]], [[St Asaph]], N Wales where he studied theology. He was ordained there on 20 September 1925, aged 32.<ref>Hurn pp 10-11</ref>\n\nAfter ordination, Roberts had spells teaching back at Preston College, then at [[Beaumont College]], [[Old Windsor]], Berkshire, where he set up a branch of the [[Catholic Evidence Guild]], with 33 speakers at pitches in four dioceses. His [[tertianship]] was at [[Paray-le-Monial]] in the [[Sa\u00f4ne-et-Loire]] [[Departments of France|department]], followed by another six years, 1929-1935, teaching at Preston College. In early 1935 he became the youngest Jesuit rector in the country when he was appointed rector of St Francis Xavier's, Liverpool.{{efn|Coincidentally, his parents had married there.<ref name=\"Catholic Times 1937\"/>}} St Francis Xavier's was one of the largest parishes in England, in a inner-city area, with high unemployment and clashes between Catholics from Southern Ireland and Protestants from Northern Ireland.<ref>Hurn pp 11-12</ref>  \n\nOn 3 August 1937 he learned he had been named Archbishop of Bombay when a journalist from the ''Liverpool Post'' asked him for a comment on his appointment.<ref name=\"Oxford\"/> Years later, in retirement, he insisted his appointment had resulted from a bureaucratic blunder on the part of a Vatican official.<ref name=Kaiser>{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=WKzlFLeNLLoC&pg=PA120&lpg=PA121 | page= 121 | title = Clerical Error: A True Story | first = Robert Blair | last= Kaiser | author-link= Robert Blair Kaiser | date= 2002 | publisher =A&C Black | accessdate= 14 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Archbishop of Bombay==\n[[Mumbai|Bombay]] was ceded by the Portuguese to England in 1661 as part of the dowry of [[Catherine of Braganza]] on her marriage to [[King Charles II of England|King Charles II]]. Ever since then there had been difficulties between the Portuguese on the one side and the English and the [[Holy See|Vatican]] on the other side over the administration of the Catholic Church in India in general and the appointment of the Archbishop of Bombay in particular. The Vatican had set up the [[Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples|Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith]] (known for short by the Latin word ''Propaganda'') to be responsible for missionary areas such as India. However, the Portuguese claimed that the ''[[Padroado]]'' (by which the Vatican had, beginning in the 15th century, delegated to the kings of Portugal the administration of local churches in the Portuguese sphere of influence) gave them that right in those territories in perpetuity even where Portugual had ceded control. In 1928 it was agreed under a [[concordat]] between the Vatican and the English and Portuguese Catholic hierarchies that the post of Archbishop of Bombay would be held alternately by a Portuguese and an English Jesuit. There was no provision for an Indian. The first ordinary appointed under the concordat was a Portuguese, Archbishop Joachim Lima, S.J. He died on 21 July 1936 and [[Pope Pius XI]] appointed Roberts on 12 August 1937.<ref>Hurn pp 29-33</ref><ref>''Black Popes'', p viii</ref>\n\nRoberts received his episcopal consecration on 21 September 1937 from the Archbishop of Liverpool, [[Richard Downey]]. Co-consecrators were the Archbishop of Cardiff, [[Francis Mostyn (archbishop of Cardiff)|Francis Mostyn]], who had ordained Roberts, and the [[Vicar General]] of Liverpool archdiocese, Robert Dobson.<ref name=\"Catholic Times 1937\"/> Over 100 priests attended and the congregation of over 1000 spilled out into the street for a service which lasted over three hours, a tribute to someone who 2\u00bd years previously was an obscure lower form master at Preston College.<ref name=\"Catholic Herald 1937\">{{cite news | title = Crowds at Liverpool Ceremony |work=Catholic Herald |date=24 September 1937}}</ref>\n\nAs his episcopal motto Roberts chose ''Carior libertas'', \"Freedom is more precious\", from the motto of the Irish branch of his family, the d'Esterres, ''Patria cara, carior libertas'': \"My country is precious, but freedom is more precious\".<ref name=\"Catholic Herald 1937\"/>\n\nShortly afterwards, Roberts left Liverpool for Bombay. On the way, he spent two weeks in Lisbon in an attempt to lessen the tensions that still existed between the two hierarchies.<ref name=\"Examiner 6 Feb 1954\">{{cite news | title=Farewell to Archbishop Roberts |work= The [Bombay] Examiner |date=6 February 1954}}</ref> He saw the Prime Minister, [[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar|Dr Salazar]], and [[Manuel Gon\u00e7alves Cerejeira|Cardinal Cerejeira]], the first time a non-Portuguese archbishop had made contact with the Portuguese authorities.<ref name=\"Tablet Obit\"/> He arrived in Bombay on 1 December 1937.<ref>''From the Bridge'', pp1,7</ref>\n\nThe Catholic archdiocese of Bombay was the largest in India, and stretched from Baroda (modern name [[Vadodara]]), [[Gujarat]] state, about 300 miles north of Bombay, to the village of [[Korlai Fort|Korlai]], in [[Maharashtra]] state, about 50 miles south. There were 68 parishes with 140,000 members predominantly among the poorer sector. There were 121 [[secular clergy]], 66 Jesuits, and three [[Salesians of Don Bosco|Salesians]]. It had a college of higher education, [[St. Xavier's College, Mumbai|Xavier\u2019s]], the largest in Bombay and later to become a constituent of [[University of Mumbai|Bombay University]], 25 high schools and 88 middle and primary schools.<ref>Aguiar, p 69</ref> \n\nOverlapping and cutting across the ''Padroado''/''Propaganda'' division was a further division based on place of origin: indigenous Bombay Indians, immigrants from Catholic centres such as [[Goa]], [[Mangalore]], [[Chennai|Madras]], and [[Malabar region|Malabar]], as well as Europeans and Anglo-Indians. All were deeply suspicious and jealous of each other.<ref>Aguiar, p 68</ref> Roberts exploited his relationship-building with the Portuguese by rationalising the parish structures with the help of the Portuguese [[Consul|Consul General]].<ref name=\"Examiner 6 Feb 1954\"/>\n\nParticularly controversial was his decision to abolish the parish of Our Lady of  Esperance{{efn|Also known as Nossa Senhora da Esperan\u00e7a, easily confused with others with this name of which there were many in India.}} at [[Bhuleshwar]]. This had been the cathedral parish since 1887 but the church was a vast, expensive to maintain building in an area by then devoid of Catholics.<ref>Aguiar, p 78</ref>  He sold the land and used the proceeds to build churches in the suburbs where the Catholics then lived. He adopted the Church of the Holy Name, the parish church on the harbour, as his pro-cathedral, later to become the [[Cathedral of the Holy Name, Mumbai]]. He broke with tradition by appointing not a Jesuit but a Goan, Fr [[Valerian Gracias]], as its first secular rector.<ref>Hurn p 36</ref> This was part of a policy of steady Indianisation of the clergy, which Roberts adopted with the blessing of his Jesuit superiors, and which was virtually complete in the archdiocese by 1945.<ref>Hurn p 42</ref>\n\nRoberts worked on improving the unity of the archdiocese by a series of letters to the children of his diocese, published in ''[[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bombay#Media|The Examiner]]'', his diocesan newspaper.<ref name=\"Tablet Obit\"/>{{efn|Many of these were later published in ''From the Bridge'', the title of which was a reference to Roberts's nautical interests.<ref>Hurn pp 37-38</ref>}} He put in place a wide range of social services particularly for the poor, orphans, and prostitutes much of it paid for by fund-raising carried out by the children in response to his appeals to them through ''The Examiner'', many catalogued in ''From the Bridge''. He set up centres where seamen could stay while in port. In 1941 he overcame stiff opposition orchestrated by Bombay University's Professor of Economics and member of the Senate [[K. T. Shah]] and established the university's Sophia College for women.<ref>University of Mumbai, list of colleges, http://mu.ac.in/portal/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Updated-All-College-List-with-Course-Detailss.pdf</ref><ref name=\"Oxford\"/> This was for Christians and non-Christians alike. He later had to overcome attempts by Shah in 1942 and again in 1943 to have the college disaffiliated from the university. The senate rejected the 1942 proposal but passed the 1943 proposal. After mass protests in Bombay the decision was overturned by the Government of Bombay which had the final say on Senate decisions.<ref>Aguiar, pp 78-79</ref>  \n\nIn 1939 [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi's]] [[Indian National Congress|Congress Party]] proposed to introduce [[Alcohol prohibition in India|prohibition]]. Roberts, in an address to the [[Rotary International|Rotary Club]], subsequently broadcast on All India Radio, argued that it would not succeed unless the Indian people were solidly behind it, which he was unconvinced was the case. Although his view received wide approval, it brought him into conflict with Gandhi, who drew a parallel between the state provision of drinking facilities and the state provision of women for prostitution.<ref>Aguiar, p 75, quoting from Gandhi's publication [[Harijan#Mohandas Gandhi's publication|Harijan]]</ref>\n\nDuring [[World War II]] Roberts was appointed [[Bishopric of the Forces in Great Britain|Bishop Delegate]] to [[British Armed Forces|H.M. Armed Forces]] in the [[India Command|Indian]] and [[South East Asia Command|South East Asia]] Commands. As his American counterpart was unable to fly he also ministered to American service personnel. This involved flights of over 2000 miles (each way) in service planes to where the troops were, in [[Assam]], [[Myanmar|Burma]] and as far as the Chinese border, and meant he could be away for months at a time.<ref>Aguiar, p 80</ref><ref name=\"Dayton\">{{cite press release |title=Archbishop Thomas d'Esterre Roberts, S.J. to Open Religion in Life Series| date= 13 October 1969 |publisher= University of Dayton | url= https://ecommons.udayton.edu/news_rls/3531 | accessdate= 10 October 2018}}</ref> This was not without risk, and he was involved in two crash-landings, one when the undercarriage jammed, the other when an engine failed in mid-flight. For this work he received the [[Kaisar-i-Hind Medal|Kaisar-i-Hind gold medal]], probably its last recipient. There was a particular problem with the presence in India of religious communities from the Axis powers, particularly German and Italian Catholic nuns. The [[British Raj|British colonial rulers]] invited Roberts, as the only British prelate in India, to sit on the commission set up to deal with them.<ref>Hurn pp 42-44</ref>\n\nWith India moving towards independence, Roberts saw that it would be untenable to keep the system whereby Indian Catholics were governed alternately by a British and a Portuguese archbishop. In May 1945 he visited Pope Pius XII in Rome and proposed that the 1928 concordat be terminated, followed by his demitting his post as archbishop. If he simply resigned he would be succeeded by a Portuguese, not an Indian. To get round this, Roberts planned to appoint an Indian auxiliary bishop, ostensively with a view to proving that Indians were perfectly capable of running their own affairs. An auxiliary bishop had no right of succession (so the Portuguese could not object) but might in practice succeed, especially once India was independent. While accepting Roberts's plan in principle, the Pope asked for an explicit undertaking from Roberts that he would not drop the title of Archbishop of Bombay. Roberts returned to India to manage the transfer of his responsibilities to the auxiliary bishop. On 16 May 1946 Gracias was appointed and Roberts consecrated him on 29 June 1946.<ref>Hurn pp 44-47</ref> Roberts then left for England on an oil tanker, the ''British Aviator''.<ref>Aguiar, p 81</ref>\n\nSo long as the Portuguese insisted on their rights, Roberts could neither resign nor drop his title. As a result he could not take up another permanent appointment. His arrangement with Pius XII required him to be out of Bombay (at sea or in America) to leave any possible successor a free hand, but with the possibility of returning to Bombay if necessary.<ref>Statement by Roberts, as a postcript to Aguiar, p 81</ref> Thanks to some friends in the [[British Tanker Company]], part of what is now [[BP]], he spent a period as a temporary chaplain of the [[Apostleship of the Sea]], working on oil tankers. He spent some time in India again in 1947/1948 after being ordered back by the Vatican by mistake. He left again in August 1948 by signing on as a crew member of an oil tanker in Bombay harbour, leaving his auxiliary in complete charge.<ref>Hurn pp 47-48</ref> \n\nEventually Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru|Nehru]] of the now Republic of India called for an end to the remains of colonisation. ''Padroado'' and the 1928 Concordat were terminated on 18 July 1950<ref>Hurn p 49</ref> and Roberts's resignation was finally accepted in December 1950. He was succeeded by Gracias, later to become the first Indian cardinal.<ref name=\"Gracias Obit\">{{cite news| title=Archbishop T. D.

However, the announcement that he was ill did not help Roberts in his quest for a new position, even a temporary one.<ref>Hurn p 49</ref> Talk of other full-time episcopal appointments perhaps in [[Guyana]] or the [[West Indies]] came to nothing.<ref name=\"Tablet Obit\"/> He resumed life as a Jesuit in the English province and dedicated himself to lecturing and writing. He gave retreats for a time at [[Loyola Hall]], Rainhill, Merseyside. In 1951 he became Spiritual Father at [[Campion Hall]], University of Oxford. From 1954 he was based at the [[Church of the Immaculate Conception, Farm Street#Mount Street Centre|Mount Street Jesuit Centre]], London. He travelled a great deal, visiting Jesuit institutions and giving retreats in Scotland, England, Germany, and the USA, including periods on the staff of [[Gonzaga University]] in Spokane, Washington, from May 1958 to September 1959 and for another six months in 1960.

Failing this, authority is liable to become abuse. Because of the danger of abuse, obedience to authority should not be out of fear but \"intelligent\" i.e. questioning and reasoned: he drew an analogy to the non-Catholic's appeal to conscience. \n\nHe also criticised the bureaucratic process in the church's marital courts and called for greater involvement of the laity in church affairs.<ref>''Black Popes'' pp 4-33</ref>\n\nIn April 1961 he followed this up with \"Naked Power: Authority in the Church Today\", a paper delivered to a symposium on ''Problems of Authority'' held at the [[Bec Abbey|Abbey of Our Lady of Bec]], Normandy.<ref>Hurn p 68 et seq</ref> In a quote from ''Black Popes'' he took issue with the discouragement of criticism to higher authority in the church: such questioning was regarded as treason<ref>Hurn p 69</ref>, heresy or rebellion<ref>Hurn p 74</ref>, whereas Roberts regarded it as a duty.<ref>Hurn pp 77-82</ref> He pointed out that there were many instances in the ''[[Acts of the Apostles]]'' of open disagreements between Christ's disciples.<ref>''Black Popes'' p 5</ref> He went on to criticise ecclesiastical proceedings under [[Canon Law]].

He did, however, agree to appear for the defence at the trial in 1962 of the [[Committee of 100 (United Kingdom)#1962-1968|Wethersfield Six]] who were prosecuted after 5,000 protesters occupied the runway at an RAF base to prevent planes taking off. In the event, the key question that he was asked by defence counsel on whether nuclear weapons were immoral was ruled of out of order by the judge.<ref>Hurn p 64</ref>\n\nIn July 1963, Roberts published an article in ''Continuum'', an American Catholic review, entitled \"The Arms Race and Vatican II\".{{efn|The article was re-printed in the book ''Objections to Roman Catholicism.''<ref>''Objections'', pp 182 et seq</ref>}} In it he developed [[Pope John XXIII]]'s statement on nuclear non-proliferation in his 11 April 1963 [[encyclical#Catholic usage|encyclical]] ''On Establishing Universal Peace in Truth, Justice, Charity and Liberty'' (''[[Pacem in Terris]]'') that \" \u2026 if any government does not acknowledge the rights of man, or violates them, it not only fails in its duty, but its orders completely lack juridical force.\"<ref>Quoted in ''Objections'', pp 183</ref> Given that in a nuclear war there was likely to be accidental destruction of non-participating countries Roberts concluded that nuclear warfare was not morally lawful.\n\nIn a \"question and answer\" session with the American (Catholic) Pax society (published in their autumn 1964 newsletter, ''Peace'')<ref>Extracts quoted in Hurn pp 61-67</ref> Roberts said that most bishops on both sides during the recent war justified supporting their governments on grounds of obedience to the authority of the state. Noting that this was rejected at the Nuremberg trials Roberts argued that the \"individual has a fundamental right to freely follow his own conscience\" and that \"conscientious abstention\" (his preferred phrase) was a human right.\n\nIn March 1968 Roberts joined a small group praying outside the American Embassy in London for [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War#1968|an end to the Vietnam War]] and for the right of conscientious objection. He later accompanied them to a meeting in the embassy. This attracted some attention in the press because earlier in the month 10,000 had rallied in Trafalgar Square and their march on the embassy had turned into a riot with 86 injured and 200 arrests.<ref>{{cite news| title=Protests |first= John |last=Short |work=Catholic Pictorial | date= 31 March 1968}}</ref>\n\n==Delation to Rome==\nIn May 1960, while he was still at Gonzaga University, Roberts first heard of charges against him in a letter from Archbishop [[Gerald O'Hara|O'Hara]], then [[Apostolic Delegate]] to Great Britain, in London.

O'Hara also accused him of revealing, at that Pax conference, \"the secrets of the [[Second Vatican Council|[Second Vatican] Council]]\" in that he had disclosed his reply to a request from Cardinal [[Domenico|Tardini]] for suggestions for the agenda.{{efn|Tardini, as Cardinal Secretary of State, had written to all bishops soliciting items for discussion at the Council}}\n\nO'Hara also alleged that Roberts had written a letter published in ''The Universe'' attacking the English bishops on their implementation of the Pope's wishes on sacred music and the liturgy.\n\nO'Hara then quoted in full a letter from Cardinal [[Marcello Mimmi|Mimmi]], Secretary of the [[Congregation for Bishops#History|Sacred Consistorial Congregation for Bishops]] which said in essence that Roberts should keep silent in future. O'Hara had already sent copies of the proceedings to four curial Roman departments{{efn|These were the [[Congregation for Bishops|Consistorial Congregation]], the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith|Holy Office]], the [[Section for Relations with States (Roman Curia)|Congregation of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs]], and the [[Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life|Congregation of Religious]].<ref>Hurn p 100</ref>}} and to the Secretary General of the Jesuits.\n\nIn reply, Roberts refuted the charges and complained that the allegations had been heard, judgement given and punitive action taken before the accused even knew he had been charged.\n\nOn the specific charges, he was unaware of any ban on Pax by Griffin, and the relevant conference at Spode, \"an irreproachable venue\", was advertised in Catholic newspapers. His letter to Tardini did not suggest what the Council might discuss. He had merely asked for an extra-conciliar examination of an issue that troubled the consciences of many people, namely personal decisions about participation in nuclear war.{{efn|In any case, while communications from the Vatican were confidential, bishops were free to publicise their replies and many did, including Roberts at the Spode conference.}} Finally, Roberts challenged O'Hara to produce the letter he was supposed to have written to The Universe attacking the English hierarchy.{{efn|The point was that he had written no such letter.}}\n\nRoberts said that he would ask the Vatican for a full investigation of the charges. If found true he would accept the punishment; if false he would expect his innocence to be given as much publicity as the allegations of guilt had already been given without his knowledge.\n\nThree months later, O'Hara wrote again to tell Roberts that his book ''Black Popes'' (published 6 years previously) had been discussed at a plenary session of the Holy Office. The Holy Office had issued a decree that \"scandalous\" portions of the book be omitted or modified in subsequent editions and asked for confirmation of execution of the decree. Roberts wrote back on 5 September 1960 to say that there was no question of new editions at present. On his informing his publishers they had asked which passages had caused offence: no detail had been given other than that the offending material was in chapters 6 and 7. These dealt respectively with the succession and controversial reign of [[Pope Boniface VIII]] (1294-1303){{efn|Roberts was later to devote a chapter of his book ''Diary of Bathsheeba'' to criticising Boniface's actions.<ref>''Diary...'' chapter 2, pp 23-35</ref>}} and the suppression of the Society of Jesus by [[Pope Clement XIV]] for political reasons in 1773. Roberts pointed out that the condemnation of ''Black Popes'' could embarrass the Pope as the book's Spanish edition had an ''imprimatur'' and there had been many positive reviews of the book in the Catholic press.{{efn|[[Yves Congar]], who became a key figure at the Second Vatican Council, noted in his diary in 1961 that Roberts had not been ordered to withdraw his criticisms of contemporary church governance, \"and those are the pages to which he himself is most attached\".<ref>{{cite book | accessdate = 14 October 2018 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=MlIYG3_oaM4C&pg=PA45 | page=45 | title = My Journal of the Council | first= Yves | last= Congar | author-link= Yves Congar | date= 2012 | publisher = Liturgical Press}}</ref>}} \n\nRoberts posited that bishops owed to the church a standard of justice higher than any in the world,<ref>''Black Popes'' p 6</ref> for example England where justice had to be \"done and seen to be done\". In order to illustrate his case to the Pope, he obtained the opinions of two experienced lawyers, including an authority on criminal libel, as to the likely outcome of a hypothetical referral to the English courts. He intended then to use his own case as a good example of what was wrong with proceedings under Canon Law. Both lawyers independently advised that the actions of Archbishop O'Hara in the letter of May 1960 and the condemnation of passages in ''Black Popes'' would, in the English courts, be regarded as defamatory. Although O'Hara could claim that his communications were covered by privilege, that claim would be defeated because there was evidence, for example the absence of due process, of malice on the part of O'Hara. This would render O'Hara liable in an action for libel and could give rise to a criminal prosecution.\n\nRoberts saw [[Pope John XXIII]] on 6 December 1960. The Pope undertook to open an enquiry into the affair. Despite sending reminders Roberts heard nothing further; eventually Cardinal [[Amleto Giovanni Cicognani|Cicognani]], Cardinal Secretary of State and President of the Co-ordinating Commission of the Vatican Council told Roberts in December 1962 that Roberts's hearing nothing meant vindication and there would be no bar to his attending the Council. The Pope, who had been seriously ill for some time, died on 3 June 1963. O'Hara died a month later. Roberts let the matter rest but he remained troubled by it because it was a matter of truth and conscience.<ref>Hurn chapter nine, pp 94-112;</ref><ref name=\"Oxford\"/><ref name=\"Tablet Obit\"/>\n\n==Position on contraception==\nRoberts gave the inaugural address to the Catholic Medical Guild of St Luke, Bombay, which he had set up in 1938. In this he extolled them to follow \"Christian tradition\" and \"not [to] restrict birth artificially\". He went on to criticise the 1930 [[Lambeth Conference#Seventh: 1930|Lambeth Conference]] for its abandonment of its previous stance against contraception.{{efn|See Resolution 15, The Lambeth Conference, Resolutions Archive from 1930\nhttps://www.anglicancommunion.org/media/127734/1930.pdf}}\n<ref>Aguiar p 73</ref>\n\nIn the early 1960s, questions began to be asked by Cardinal [[Leo Joseph Suenens|Suenens]] and by many others in the Catholic Church about the appropriateness of its ban on contraception.<ref>Hurn p 130</ref> In order to forestall mass discussion of the topic at the Second Vatican Council, Pope John XXIII set up a Pontifical Commission on Birth Control in 1963.<ref name=\"NCR\">{{cite news|title=New birth control commission papers reveal Vatican's hand |last= Slevin |first= Gerald |work=National Catholic Reporter |date= 23 March 2011 | url= https://www.ncronline.org/news/vatican/new-birth-control-commission-papers-reveal-vaticans-hand |accessdate=15 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nInformed by his nine years in India, with its high birth rates and poverty, Roberts, too, had come to question the continued appropriateness of the Catholic traditional approach. He gave an interview to [[Michael de la B\u00e9doy\u00e8re]] for publication in the April 1964 edition of the latter\u2019s magazine ''Search''. In this he admitted that could not understand the Catholic Church's position that contraception was \"unethical\". He could not see how the position taken by the 1958 Lambeth Conference{{efn|This had laid responsibility for deciding the number and frequency of children on the consciences of parents in the context of the resources of the family and the needs of society as a whole.<ref>Resolution 115, The Lambeth Conference, Resolutions Archive from 1958, https://www.anglicancommunion.org/media/127740/1958.pdf</ref>}} could be refuted by reason alone and said that if he were not bound by the Church's ruling he would have accepted it.<ref>''Search'' article is quoted in Hurn pp 131-136 and also in {{cite web| accessdate= 3 October 2018 | url=http://www.catholicsandcontraception.com/pope-and-pill-1968-pyle/ |publisher= [[Wijngaards Institute for Catholic Research]]| title= Pope and Pill}}</ref>\n\nOn 7 May 1964, English bishops led by Archbishop (later Cardinal) [[John Heenan (cardinal)|Heenan]] published in the ''Sunday Times'' a statement quoting [[Pope Pius XI]]'s encyclical letter ''Christian Marriage'', 1930, (''[[Casti connubii]]'') that contraception was \"against the laws of God and of nature\" and that the church \"cannot change God's law\".  In a thinly veiled attack on Roberts they warned of \"false leaders\". Roberts was then in Chicago. The London ''Evening Standard'' drew his attention to the article and asked for a response which it would publish. In it Roberts denied the claim of the English hierarchy that he was \"leading people astray\". He merely represented the views of many in the church in calling for a review. After all, the Church had changed its mind historically about what was and what was not sinful.<ref>Hurn pp 137-143</ref><ref>''Objections'' p 177</ref>\n\nRoberts wrote an expanded version of the ''Search'' paper which was published later in 1964 in ''Objections to Roman Catholicism'' alongside his ''Continuum'' paper on war. At the same time he contributed the introduction to a symposium on ''Contraception and Holiness: the Catholic Predicament''. Roberts argued from his experience seeing the poverty and malnutrition caused by the population explosion in India on the back of improved medical facilities and the failure of the Indian government's attempt to promote the [[Calendar-based contraceptive methods|rhythm method]]. He was also conscious of the divergent attitudes to this question taken by Christian missionaries in India from Catholic and Protestant traditions yet the term \"natural law\" implied something that should be universally recognised. He intended to say so at the Second Vatican Council, which was then in progress. He would urge the Council, as an ecumenical council, to consult widely but specifically to include married couples in order to re-examine the question with a view to clarifying this \"natural law\" and to justifying its case by logical reasoning.<ref>''Objections'' pp 173, 176-180</ref>\n\nIn practice, discussion at the Council was stifled when the Pope, by now John XXIII's successor, [[Pope Paul VI|Paul VI]], announced that the matter was reserved to him.<ref>Hurn p 125</ref> In 1966, after the end of Vatican II but before the Commission reported, during which there was a feeling in the Catholic laity that there might shortly be a relaxation of the ban on contraception, Roberts wrote ''Quaker Marriage: A Dialogue between Conscience and Coercion''. This was a case study about an imaginary couple, the man a devout Quaker, the woman a devout Catholic, who had been told after the difficult birth of their first child that future pregnancies were likely to be fatal for the wife. The paper explored their relationship with each other and with their traditionally-minded parish priest and his more liberal curate. It was published in the symposium ''The Future of Catholic Christianity''.\n\nThe Pontifical Commission reported after the close of the Council, a large majority recommending that the ban on artificial birth control be lifted. This was rejected by the Pope, who accepted a minority report. This admitted that there was no argument in reason why contraception should be condemned, but recommended that the Pope use his authority to maintain the status quo. On 29 July 1968 the Pope issued the encyclical ''[[Humanae Vitae]]'' reaffirming the ban.<ref name=\"NCR\"/> Roberts was reported in the ''New York Times'' as having said that the encyclical \"flies in the face of reality\" and that Catholics no longer raised the use of birth control in the confessional.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Leo |first1=John|title=Takes Note of Opposition; Dissent is Voiced |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1968/07/30/76958013.pdf |accessdate=23 June 2018 |work=New York Times |date=30 July 1968}}</ref>\n\nWhen asked to, Roberts continued to speak on contraception, but was careful never to undermine the papacy or hierarchy tasked with promulgation of the ruling. He stuck to the facts: how the decision was made, the views of bishops in various parts of the world, the views of non-Catholic Christians and of non-Christians,{{efn|The encyclical was addressed \"to all men of good will\".}} that the encyclical was not subject to \"[[Infallibility#Christianity|infallibility]]\", and that popes had made mistakes in the past.<ref>{{cite news| title=Archbishop speaks on the pill |last=Moore |first= Tim |work=Nationalist & Leinster Times |date=19 August 1968}}</ref>\n\n==Involvement with Second Vatican Council==\nRoberts attended the [[Second Vatican Council]] (\"Vatican II\"), held from 1962 to 1965, but he never managed to speak on the council floor.<ref name=\"Tablet Obit\"/> In the second period (autumn 1963), Roberts submitted a paper asking for reform in ecclesiastical procedures affecting marriage and divorce which he claimed were cruel and unnecessarily drawn out.<ref name=\"NYT Obit\"/> \nIn the third period (autumn 1964), in the session on \"The Church in the Modern World\", Roberts submitted a shortened version of his ''Continuum'' paper and asked for Catholic support for conscientious objection to wars that were immoral. He cited the recently publicised case of [[Franz J\u00e4gerst\u00e4tter]] executed by the Germans in World War II.<ref name=\"Pax Obit\"/> He was not called to speak and conscientious objection and the question of obedience that made World War II possible were not discussed.<ref>Hurn p 55</ref> The statement which eventually emerged in  ''[[Gaudium et Spes]]'' fell short of a demand for unilateral nuclear disarmament but left little scope for any real conviction that the use of nuclear weapons could be justified.<ref name=\"Kay Obit\"/>\n\nThis was followed by a session on \"Marriage and the Family\". Roberts applied to speak, submitting a shortened version of his ''Objections'' paper on contraception.<ref>Quoted in Hurn p 128-129</ref> He was not called to speak, but the matter was taken up by other bishops, including Cardinal Suenens who warned \"let us avoid a new Galileo case\".<ref>Hurn p 152</ref> Discussion was curtailed pending the report of the Pontifical Commission.\n\nNot being called to speak at the Council sessions, Roberts took every opportunity to make his views known outside them, for example in press conferences.<ref>Hurn p 126</ref> Referring to a discussion in Council on the guilt of the Jews for deicide, he took the opportunity to return to his theme of the Church's discouragement of criticism: \"It is so plain that the guilt lay not with the Jewish people, but with the Jewish priestly establishment, that it seems legitimate to wonder whether the refusal to face up to this may not be a subconscious reluctance to face up to the analogy in the Church today\".<ref> Thomas Beaudoin, ''Catholics, Jews, and Vatican II: A New Beginning'', quoting from Frederick Franck, ''Exploding Church'' (New York: Delacorte Press, 1968), 230, The Historical Text Archive, http://historicaltextarchive.com/sections.php/sections.php?action=read&artid=76</ref>\n\n==Roberts's attitude to women==\nRoberts's stance on women was that they must not be treated as second-class citizens.<ref name=\"Month Lucas\">Lucas, Barbara, ''Women's Liberator'', ''The Month'', March 1973, pp 108-109</ref> \n\nHe founded Bombay University's Sophia College for women in 1941, 6 years before women were admitted as full members of [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] in England.<ref>University of Cambridge, History, The University after 1945. https://www.cam.ac.uk/about-the-university/history/the-university-after-1945</ref>\n\nWhen Vatican II started women were not admitted (all observers had to be male). When the Quaker observer at the Council, [[:de:Richard Karl Ullmann|Dr Ullmann]], died in August 1963, Roberts suggested that his widow be invited to attend in his stead, but this was not possible. At a press conference he gave on 22 October 1963, during the 2nd session, he complained that \"There are whole classes of Catholics unrepresented at this Council: nuns and other women.\" Women were admitted as observers from the 3rd session (September 1964) onwards.<ref>Allen, John L, Jnr, ''Remembering the women of Vatican II'', ''National Catholic Reporter'', 12 October 2012)</ref>\n\nIn a 1964 interview in the New York Catholic Magazine ''Jubilee'' Roberts complained that the church's attitude to women had hardly changed since [[Old Testament]] times. He pointed out that the views of the early [[Church Fathers]] reflected the views of their time, namely that women were little more than animals and that procreation was the sole purpose of sex in marriage. He went on to criticise professors in seminaries for not emphasising to seminarians that such views were no longer valid.<ref>Hurn p 160</ref>\n\nIn his introduction to ''Contraception and Holiness'', written before the composition of the Pontifical Commission on Birth Control was made public, Roberts echoed Cardinal Suenens's call for a special commission \"composed of laymen and clergy, men ''and women'' [emphasis in original] to study the problem in collaboration with the [Pontifical Commission].\"<ref>''Contraception''  p 23</ref>\n\nIn the run-up to the 1971 [[Synod of Bishops in the Catholic Church|Synod of Bishops]], a Belgian [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] nun, Sr Buisseret, wrote an open letter to the bishops calling for bishops to be able \"to confer on qualified women the exercise of certain ministries hitherto reserved to men, not excluding the priesthood\". This would be \"on an experimental basis\" and \"in certain limited areas of the church\": she instanced missionary areas where priests were in short supply.<ref>Extracts from her letter, which included a discussion of the arguments against female priests, were published in ''The Church in the World: News and Notes from all Parts'', ''The Tablet'', 4 September 1971.</ref> She asked for those who agreed with her proposal to write to her indicating their support. Roberts wrote that his experience as a Jesuit priest for 48 [sic]{{efn|Actually 46}} years and an archbishop for 34 years led him to \"endorse her suggestion without reserve.\"<ref>''Letters to the Editor'', ''The Tablet'', 18 September 1971.</ref><ref name=\"Month Lucas\"/>\n\n==Roberts's unconventionality==\nObedience was an obsession for Roberts and he took his vow of poverty literally, eschewing 1st class travel and wearing handed-down clothes.<ref>Hurn pp 3-5</ref> At the Vatican Council, he stayed in a tiny room and would often receive visitors in a pyjama top and aged shawl over black trousers.<ref>{{cite news|title=Archbishop Thomas d\u2019Esterre Roberts |work=Sunday Times Magazine |date= 5 December 1965}}</ref>\n\nHe disliked ecclesiastical pomp and advocated simplification. He particularly disliked [[Pontifical High Mass]], where he felt that the focus of attention was on the bishop instead of on the service. He disliked the term \"Your Grace\" preferring to be called \"Father\". He disliked fancy lace vestments, likening them to women's underwear, and kept his episcopal ring in his back pocket to discourage people from feeling they were expected to kiss it. He disliked St Peter's Basilica in Rome and told his biographer, Hurn, \"I never feel altogether comfortable in St Peter's. I keep remembering that it was largely built from the sale of indulgences.\" These attitudes gave him an affinity with [[Low Church]] members.<ref>Hurn pp 2-6, 155</ref>\n\nHis experience of working with non-Christian religions in India led him to promote friendships with non-Catholics generally and rapprochement with other Christian denominations in particular.<ref>Hurn pp 2-3</ref> By invitation from [[Michael Ramsey|Archbishop and Mrs Ramsey]], he became the first Roman Catholic prelate to dine at [[Lambeth Palace]] since [[Reginald Pole|Cardinal Pole]], the last Roman Catholic [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], in the 16th century.<ref>Hurn p 154</ref> \n\nHe advised [[Pope Pius XII]] against [[Dogmatic definition|dogmatically defining]] the [[Assumption of Mary]] in 1950<ref name=Kaiser/> and long before Vatican II he was in favour of a relaxation of the ban on [[Cremation in the Christian World#The Roman Catholic Church|cremation]],<ref>Hurn p44</ref> advocated involvement of the laity in church affairs, and associated himself with the Christian anti-racism movement.<ref>Hurn p 155</ref>\n\n==Relationship with the Hierarchy==\nRoberts was unswervingly loyal to the church, but to him loyalty did not include passive acquiescence in the status quo, which he saw as laziness if not cowardice.<ref name=\"Month Corbishley\">Corbishley, Thomas, and Hebblethwaite, Peter, ''One Long Blast on the Whistle'', ''The Month'', March 1973, p 67</ref> His unconventional views, his willingness to challenge authority, and his association with non-Catholic Christians, unsettled some in the Catholic Hierarchy, who shunned him, blocked his activities, and on occasion actively attacked him.<ref name=\"Oxford\"/>\n\nHe was asked to lead the prayers at a interdenominational CND and Christian Action meeting in Trafalgar Square on Remembrance Sunday, 12 November 1961, but [[William Godfrey|Cardinal Godfrey]] forbad him from doing so.<ref>Hurn p 156</ref>\n\nIn 1964, the [[Fellowship of Reconciliation (United States)|Fellowship of Reconciliation]] asked him to make a lecture tour of the US and he took part in many lectures across the US and Canada.

Three days before the lunch he received a note suggesting that he withdraw, which he did. This caused speculation in the press as to who had written the note: Roberts considered himself under a vow of silence. Speculation increased when Archbishop Heenan declined to give an \"on the record\" comment.<ref>{{cite news|title=Archbishop silenced by RC authority |work=Guardian |date= 12 January 1965}}</ref> On the eve of the lunch, Fr Terence Corrigan, head of the Jesuits in England, said that he had asked Roberts to \"reconsider\" his invitation to speak as he felt that the attendance of a well known Jesuit figure on such an occasion would have suggested that the society was somehow in a dispute with the English Catholic hierarchy.<ref>{{cite news| title=Archbishop withdrew for Jesuits |work=Guardian |date= 13 January 1965}}</ref> Roberts then issued a statement which was read at the lunch in which he said, \"\u2026 neither the book as a whole, nor my contribution to it, was intended to be a move against the English Roman Catholic hierarchy. Its purpose was more vital \u2013 to air problems which were of intimate concern to thousands of Catholics, and, indeed, to the whole world. I am glad that the book is succeeding in its task.\"<ref>{{cite news| title=Archbishop withdraws from Foyles literary luncheon | work=Irish Times |date= 14 January 1965}}</ref>\n\nIn 1967, in a talk Roberts was giving at the [[University of Cambridge]] on freedom of conscience, Rev. Joseph Christie, acting chaplain for Roman Catholic students, interrupted the talk and accused Roberts of heresy.<ref name=\"NYT Obit\"/>\n\nIn 1968, Roberts was asked to give a talk to the Catholic Society at the [[University of St Andrews]]. Aware that there was likely to be unfounded criticism of his talk and misrepresentation of what he said he was very careful to stick to facts, particularly when asked directly for his view on the Scottish bishops' statement on the encyclical ''Humanae Vitae''. Nevertheless, the university chaplain, Fr Ian Gillan, intervened and accused him of publicly insulting the Scottish hierarchy and of encouraging his listeners not to follow their bishops, charges refuted by the chairman of the meeting, Miss Isabel Mageniss.<ref>{{cite news|work=Glasgow Observer |title=Students secretary defends Archbishop Roberts |date=25 October 1968}}</ref>\n\nDespite his being called a \"rogue bishop\" or a \"maverick\" by some, others, particularly among the Jesuits, thought highly enough of him to devote the entire March 1973 issue of ''[[The Month]]'' to a symposium entitled \"Tribute to Archbishop Roberts on his 80th Birthday\". As well as some biographical notes on his achievements in Bombay, this included articles discussing and developing his challenging ideas, with one author calling him the 'courageous and inspiring churchman we honour in these pages'.<ref name=\"Month Zahn \">Zahn, Gordon, ''The Limits of Legitimate Authority'', ''The Month'', March 1973, p 88</ref> \n\nHe was also in great demand from the laity who went to him for advice and encouragement, particularly in distress.<ref name=\"Tablet Obit\"/>\n\n==Death==\nAfter a month in hospital in London, Roberts died of a heart attack on 28 February 1976.<ref name=\"Gracias Obit\"/>\n\nAt his requiem mass at the [[Church of the Immaculate Conception, Farm Street]], on 8 March, Archbishop [[Bruno Heim|Heim]], Apostolic Delegate, was chief celebrant and 200 priests concelebrated, including the head of Jesuits in Great Britain. Bishop [[Christopher Butler|Butler]] preached the homily.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nRoberts was buried at [[Kensal Green Cemetery]].<ref name=\"Kay Obit\"/>\n\n==Selected writings==\n*{{cite book| title =From the Bridge (with Three Reports to the Bridge)| publisher= Bombay Examiner Press| date= 1939}}\n*{{cite book| title=Black Popes.

Owned by [[Good Karma Brands]], WWGK currently airs programming from [[Doctor Radio]] (due to the [[2019\u20142020 coronavirus pandemic]]), but prior to that had served as a secondary [[ESPN Radio]] affiliate, alongside [[sister station]] [[WKNR]]\n\nThe WWGK studios are located in [[Downtown Cleveland]].   The transmitter tower is located on Euclid Avenue at East 81st Street in the [[Fairfax, Cleveland|Fairfax]] section of Cleveland. In addition to a standard [[analog transmission]], WWGK is available online.\n\n==History==\n\n===WJMO (1540 AM)===\n{{distinguish|text=Cleveland radio station [[WJMO]]}}\nThe station's roots trace back to WJMO, which went on the air on June 1, 1947 licensed to Cleveland as a daytime-only broadcaster at 1540&nbsp;kHz<ref>{{cite news|title=WJMO in Cleveland Started Yesterday|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1947/1947-06-02-BC.pdf|accessdate=28 September 2014|agency=Broadcasting|date=June 1, 1947}}</ref> with studios at 2157 Euclid Avenue and a power of 1000 watts. The owner was Wentworth J. Marshall, formerly head of the Marshall Drug Co. chain, and the general manager was David M. Baylor. When it debuted, WJMO was the only Cleveland radio station without a network affiliation. As a result, the station specialized in recorded music. Early staff included Gene Carroll (mornings), Howie Lund (afternoons), and Billy Evans on sports.<ref>[http://ech.cwru.edu/ech-cgi/article.pl?id=W23 AM 1540's Early Years (Case Western Reserve University)]</ref>\n\nIn 1948, WJMO carried the football games of [[Case Western Reserve University|Western Reserve College]] Red Cats, both at home from League Park and on the road. In the first broadcast on September 25 Gil Gibbons called the action as Western Reserve met [[Western Michigan University|Western Michigan]] in [[Kalamazoo, Michigan|Kalamazoo]].\n\nOn June 5, 1952, in an attempt to emphasize music rather than DJs, Baylor issued an orders to play four songs every 15 minutes. As a result, a number of DJs chose to leave the station. Later than year, Wentworth sold the station on August 20 for $100,000 to Maryland-based United Broadcasting, headed by Richard Eaton. Ownership was later put in the name of Eaton's affiliated company Friendly Broadcasting of Ohio. An FM license was granted for the [[WHLK|106.5 MHz facility]] that was to take the WJMO-FM call letters, but it was slated to sign on by 1959.\n\nSome of the Announcers at WJMO in the 1970s included Rudy Green, Wes Dickenson, Billy Black, Bill Taylor, Lynn Tolliver, John O'Day, J.L. Wright, Mike Payne, Mary Holt and Ken Hawkins to name a few.\n\n===WABQ (1540 AM)===\n{{distinguish|text=Painesville radio station [[WABQ]]}}\nMeanwhile, WSRS, which was founded by S.R. Sague on December 12, 1947, broadcast 24-hours a day on 1490&nbsp;kHz licensed to suburban [[Cleveland Heights, Ohio|Cleveland Heights]], and had an FM complement at 95.3 [[Megahertz|MHz]]. On January 14, 1959, [[WJMO]] bought WSRS (at 1490-AM and 95.3-FM) and exchanged respective callsigns, studios/facilities, and staffs. Both 1540-AM and 106.5-FM were sold off to Tuschman Broadcasting Company with the switch; the 1540 facility immediately became WABQ and the 106.5 facility instead signed on as WABQ-FM before switching to WXEN that next year, carrying an ethnic format.\n\nDetroit-based Booth Broadcasting took ownership of WABQ and WXEN in the mid-1960s. During the late 1950s and early 1960s, both WABQ and WJMO focused on programming aimed at Cleveland's African American community, featuring mostly black on-air talent.\n\nIt was best known for a Top 40/R&B format as \"Tiger Radio\" in the late 1960s (Booth's [[WJLB]] in Detroit used the same \"Tiger Radio\" slogan at the time), featuring personalities like Lynn Tolliver and Ken Hawkins, Michael \"The Lover\" Payne and King Curtis Shaw, Jimmy O'jay, Jimmy Stephens, Jim Raggs and Eddie Edwards.  Mike Dix, Rich Ford, Chuck Denson, Otis Rush and Duane Jones were just a few of the many news announcers the station featured during the late 1960s and early seventies. The station's popular \"Ring-A-Ding\" talk show featured Olympic gold medalist Harrison Dillard who also handled sportscasts.  Gospel programming in the late weekday morning hours was presented by Cleveland's First Lady of Gospel, Mary Holt. Sundays featured wall-to-wall church programming with Denver Wilborn as host.\n\nThroughout the late 1960s and into the early to mid-1970s WABQ and WJMO competed for listeners among Cleveland's African-American community with WJMO often enjoying a slight ratings edge due to its ability to remain on the air after local sunset.\n\nIn April 1968 WABQ received special temporary authority from the FCC to stay on the air overnight in an attempt to help inform and comfort the community following the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King.  The special authority to remain on the air 24 hours a day expired after just a day or two.\n\nWABQ's heyday quietly faded into the 1970s and 1980s, and went through numerous format changes since. Booth Broadcasting sold off WABQ in 1984, and several different ownership changes followed as a result. Eventually, the station assumed a gospel music format and had local ownership for much of those years since.\n\n===ESPN 1540 KNR2===\nIn July 2006, the station was sold by D&E Communications (headed by Dale Edwards) to [[Beaver Dam, Wisconsin]]-based [[Good Karma Broadcasting]], LLC., headed by [[Craig Karmazin]], for $2.5 million. Just before the sale closed, WABQ switched call letters with [[Painesville, Ohio]] station WBKC 1460-AM - owned by Radio Advantage One, LLC, a sister company to D&E Communications - on October 24, 2006.\n\nFour days later, WABQ's programming officially moved to 1460, and the 1540 facility relaunched as \"ESPN Radio 1540\" with a [[sports talk radio|sports/talk]] format. The station temporarily kept the WBKC call letters before adopting the WWGK callsign that November 7.\n\nWWGK's new format at 1540 first carried the entire [[ESPN Radio]] daytime lineup on its daytime only broadcasts, much like Good Karma-owned Milwaukee station [[WAUK]]. Speculation focused on plans to purchase nighttime clearance on [[WERE]] in order to have a 24-hour network clearance. Moreover, a companion \"1540 Days - 1300 Nights\" logo on WWGK's website had confirmed this, though it was since removed. There was never any official word that such an arrangement was ever attempted.\n\nOn December 4, 2006, ''Crain's Cleveland Business'' reported that Craig Karmazin's Good Karma Broadcasting was to purchase [[WKNR]] for $7 million, eventually combining both stations under one facility at [[The Galleria at Erieview]].\n\nOn February 23, 2007, it was made official that WKNR would regain its former ESPN Radio affiliation, while WWGK would take the branding AM 1540 KNR2, (a play on [[ESPN2]]) in keeping with its sister station.  In April 2010, the station began branding itself as ESPN 1540 KNR2.  Today, WWGK and WKNR are often promoted on-air jointly as ESPN Cleveland.\n\nThe new schedule also made WWGK the [[Fox Sports Radio]] affiliate in Cleveland, but still retained (at the time) ESPN Radio shows hosted by [[Colin Cowherd]] and [[Dan Patrick]] and the final hour of ''[[Mike and Mike in the Morning]]'' - all of which WKNR was unable to air otherwise. The station also started a 24-hour streaming audio service on its website.\n\nOn August 29, 2011, [[WKRK-FM]] 92.3 switched from [[alternative rock]] to a [[sports talk]] format, and (at the time) became the new Fox Sports Radio affiliate in Cleveland.  AM 1540 then replaced FSR with further ESPN Radio programming.\n\nOn April 22, 2020, WWGK dropped all sports programming and switched to a medical news/talk format, airing programming from [[Sirius FM]]'s [[Doctor Radio]] service.

WWGK also serves as the local affiliate for ''[[The Jim Rome Show]]''.\n\nThe WWGK studios are located in [[Downtown Cleveland]].   The transmitter tower is located on Euclid Avenue at East 81st Street in the [[Fairfax, Cleveland|Fairfax]] section of Cleveland. In addition to a standard [[analog transmission]], WWGK is available online.\n\n==History==\n\n===WJMO (1540 AM)===\n{{distinguish|text=Cleveland radio station [[WJMO]]}}\nThe station's roots trace back to WJMO, which went on the air on June 1, 1947 licensed to Cleveland as a daytime-only broadcaster at 1540&nbsp;kHz<ref>{{cite news|title=WJMO in Cleveland Started Yesterday|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1947/1947-06-02-BC.pdf|accessdate=28 September 2014|agency=Broadcasting|date=June 1, 1947}}</ref> with studios at 2157 Euclid Avenue and a power of 1000 watts. The owner was Wentworth J. Marshall, formerly head of the Marshall Drug Co. chain, and the general manager was David M. Baylor. When it debuted, WJMO was the only Cleveland radio station without a network affiliation. As a result, the station specialized in recorded music. Early staff included Gene Carroll (mornings), Howie Lund (afternoons), and Billy Evans on sports.<ref>[http://ech.cwru.edu/ech-cgi/article.pl?id=W23 AM 1540's Early Years (Case Western Reserve University)]</ref>\n\nIn 1948, WJMO carried the football games of [[Case Western Reserve University|Western Reserve College]] Red Cats, both at home from League Park and on the road. In the first broadcast on September 25 Gil Gibbons called the action as Western Reserve met [[Western Michigan University|Western Michigan]] in [[Kalamazoo, Michigan|Kalamazoo]].\n\nOn June 5, 1952, in an attempt to emphasize music rather than DJs, Baylor issued an orders to play four songs every 15 minutes. As a result, a number of DJs chose to leave the station. Later than year, Wentworth sold the station on August 20 for $100,000 to Maryland-based United Broadcasting, headed by Richard Eaton. Ownership was later put in the name of Eaton's affiliated company Friendly Broadcasting of Ohio. An FM license was granted for the [[WHLK|106.5 MHz facility]] that was to take the WJMO-FM call letters, but it was slated to sign on by 1959.\n\nSome of the Announcers at WJMO in the 1970s included Rudy Green, Wes Dickenson, Billy Black, Bill Taylor, Lynn Tolliver, John O'Day, J.L. Wright, Mike Payne, Mary Holt and Ken Hawkins to name a few.\n\n===WABQ (1540 AM)===\n{{distinguish|text=Painesville radio station [[WABQ]]}}\nMeanwhile, WSRS, which was founded by S.R. Sague on December 12, 1947, broadcast 24-hours a day on 1490&nbsp;kHz licensed to suburban [[Cleveland Heights, Ohio|Cleveland Heights]], and had an FM complement at 95.3 [[Megahertz|MHz]]. On January 14, 1959, [[WJMO]] bought WSRS (at 1490-AM and 95.3-FM) and exchanged respective callsigns, studios/facilities, and staffs. Both 1540-AM and 106.5-FM were sold off to Tuschman Broadcasting Company with the switch; the 1540 facility immediately became WABQ and the 106.5 facility instead signed on as WABQ-FM before switching to WXEN that next year, carrying an ethnic format.\n\nDetroit-based Booth Broadcasting took ownership of WABQ and WXEN in the mid-1960s. During the late 1950s and early 1960s, both WABQ and WJMO focused on programming aimed at Cleveland's African American community, featuring mostly black on-air talent.\n\nIt was best known for a Top 40/R&B format as \"Tiger Radio\" in the late 1960s (Booth's [[WJLB]] in Detroit used the same \"Tiger Radio\" slogan at the time), featuring personalities like Lynn Tolliver and Ken Hawkins, Michael \"The Lover\" Payne and King Curtis Shaw, Jimmy O'jay, Jimmy Stephens, Jim Raggs and Eddie Edwards.  Mike Dix, Rich Ford, Chuck Denson, Otis Rush and Duane Jones were just a few of the many news announcers the station featured during the late 1960s and early seventies. The station's popular \"Ring-A-Ding\" talk show featured Olympic gold medalist Harrison Dillard who also handled sportscasts.  Gospel programming in the late weekday morning hours was presented by Cleveland's First Lady of Gospel, Mary Holt. Sundays featured wall-to-wall church programming with Denver Wilborn as host.\n\nThroughout the late 1960s and into the early to mid-1970s WABQ and WJMO competed for listeners among Cleveland's African-American community with WJMO often enjoying a slight ratings edge due to its ability to remain on the air after local sunset.\n\nIn April 1968 WABQ received special temporary authority from the FCC to stay on the air overnight in an attempt to help inform and comfort the community following the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King.  The special authority to remain on the air 24 hours a day expired after just a day or two.\n\nWABQ's heyday quietly faded into the 1970s and 1980s, and went through numerous format changes since. Booth Broadcasting sold off WABQ in 1984, and several different ownership changes followed as a result. Eventually, the station assumed a gospel music format and had local ownership for much of those years since.\n\n===ESPN 1540 KNR2===\nIn July 2006, the station was sold by D&E Communications (headed by Dale Edwards) to [[Beaver Dam, Wisconsin]]-based [[Good Karma Broadcasting]], LLC., headed by [[Craig Karmazin]], for $2.5 million. Just before the sale closed, WABQ switched call letters with [[Painesville, Ohio]] station WBKC 1460-AM - owned by Radio Advantage One, LLC, a sister company to D&E Communications - on October 24, 2006.\n\nFour days later, WABQ's programming officially moved to 1460, and the 1540 facility relaunched as \"ESPN Radio 1540\" with a [[sports talk radio|sports/talk]] format. The station temporarily kept the WBKC call letters before adopting the WWGK callsign that November 7.\n\nWWGK's new format at 1540 first carried the entire [[ESPN Radio]] daytime lineup on its daytime only broadcasts, much like Good Karma-owned Milwaukee station [[WAUK]]. Speculation focused on plans to purchase nighttime clearance on [[WERE]] in order to have a 24-hour network clearance. Moreover, a companion \"1540 Days - 1300 Nights\" logo on WWGK's website had confirmed this, though it was since removed. There was never any official word that such an arrangement was ever attempted.\n\nOn December 4, 2006, ''Crain's Cleveland Business'' reported that Craig Karmazin's Good Karma Broadcasting was to purchase [[WKNR]] for $7 million, eventually combining both stations under one facility at [[The Galleria at Erieview]].\n\nOn February 23, 2007, it was made official that WKNR would regain its former ESPN Radio affiliation, while WWGK would take the branding AM 1540 KNR2, (a play on [[ESPN2]]) in keeping with its sister station.  In April 2010, the station began branding itself as ESPN 1540 KNR2.  Today, WWGK and WKNR are often promoted on-air jointly as ESPN Cleveland.\n\nThe new schedule also made WWGK the [[Fox Sports Radio]] affiliate in Cleveland, but still retained (at the time) ESPN Radio shows hosted by [[Colin Cowherd]] and [[Dan Patrick]] and the final hour of ''[[Mike and Mike in the Morning]]'' - all of which WKNR was unable to air otherwise. The station also started a 24-hour streaming audio service on its website.\n\nOn August 29, 2011, [[WKRK-FM]] 92.3 switched from [[alternative rock]] to a [[sports talk]] format, and (at the time) became the new Fox Sports Radio affiliate in Cleveland.  AM 1540 then replaced FSR with further ESPN Radio programming.\n\nOn April 22, 2020, WWGK dropped all sports programming and switched to a medical news/talk format, airing programming from [[Sirius FM]]'s [[Doctor Radio]] service.  This was done to provide a health-related service during the [[2019\u20142020 coronoavirus pandemic]].  Good Karma management has stated sports programming will eventually resume as events warrant.<ref>[http://www.radioinsight.com/headlines/186287/1540-wwgk-cleveland-to-add-sirusxms-coronavirus-programming/ 1540 WWGK Cleveland to add Sirius XM coronavirus programming - Radio Inisight.com]</ref>  \n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{Official website|https://goodkarmabrands.com/espn-cleveland}}\n*{{FCC letter|callsign=FCC History Cards for WWGK|letterid=46285}}{{AM station data|WWGK}}\n\n{{Cleveland Radio}}\n{{Sports Radio Stations in Ohio}}\n{{Daytime-only radio stations in Ohio}}\n{{ESPN Ohio}}\n{{Good Karma Broadcasting}}\n\n[[Category:1947 establishments in Ohio]]\n[[Category:ESPN Radio stations]]\n[[Category:Radio stations established in 1947]]\n[[Category:Radio stations in Cleveland|WGK]]\n[[Category:Daytime-only radio stations]]\n", "name_user": "Vjmlhds", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWGK"}
