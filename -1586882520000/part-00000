There are also three [[Crown dependencies]]: [[Guernsey]], [[Jersey]] and the [[Isle of Man]].  The United Kingdom comprises [[England]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Scotland]], and [[Wales]], each [[countries of the United Kingdom|country]] having its own history, with all but Northern Ireland having been independent states at one point. The [[history of the formation of the United Kingdom]] is very complex.\n\nThe [[British monarch]] was [[head of state]] of all of the countries of the British Isles from the [[Union of the Crowns]] in 1603 until the enactment of the [[Republic of Ireland Act]] in 1949, although the term \"British Isles\" was not used in 1603.  Additionally, since the independence of most of Ireland, historians of the region often avoid the term ''British Isles'' due to the complexity of relations between the peoples of the [[archipelago]] (see: ''[[Terminology of the British Isles]]'').\n\n==Prehistoric==\n{{Main|Prehistoric Britain|Prehistoric Ireland}}\n\n===Palaeolithic and Mesolithic periods===\nThe [[Palaeolithic]] and [[Mesolithic]], also known as the Old and Middle Stone Ages, were characterised by a [[hunter-gatherer]] economy and a reliance on stone tool technologies.\n\n====Palaeolithic====\nThe [[Prehistoric Britain|Lower Palaeolithic period in the British Isles]] saw the region's first known habitation by early hominids, specifically the extinct [[Homo heidelbergensis]].\n\nOne of the most prominent archaeological sites dating to this period is that of [[Boxgrove Quarry]] in West Sussex, southern [[England]].\n\n====Mesolithic (10,000 to 4,500 BC)====\nBy the Mesolithic, ''[[Homo sapiens]]'', or modern humans, were the only hominid species to still survive in the British Isles.\nBritish Isles were linked to continental Europe by a territory named [[Doggerland]].\n\n===Neolithic and Bronze Ages (4500 to 600 BC)===\n{{main|Neolithic British Isles|Bronze Age Britain|Bronze Age Ireland}}\n\nIn the British Isles, the Neolithic and Bronze Ages saw the transformation of British and Irish society and landscape. It saw the adoption of agriculture, as communities gave up their hunter-gatherer modes of existence to begin farming.\n\n===Iron Age (1200 BC to 600 AD)===\n{{main|British Iron Age|Irish Iron Age}}\nhell\nAs its name suggests, the British Iron Age is also characterised by the adoption of [[iron]], a metal which was used to produce a variety of different tools, ornaments and weapons.\n\nIn the course of the first millennium BC, and possibly earlier, some combination of [[trans-cultural diffusion]] and immigration from continental Europe resulted in the establishment of [[Celtic languages]] in the islands, eventually giving rise to the [[Insular Celtic languages|Insular Celtic]] group. What languages were spoken in the islands before is unknown, though they are assumed to have been [[Pre-Indo-European languages|Pre-Indo-European]].\n\n==Classical period==\n{{main|Roman Britain|Wales in the Roman era|Scotland during the Roman Empire}}\n[[File:End.of.Roman.rule.in.Britain.383.410.jpg|thumb|[[End of Roman rule in Britain]], 383\u2013410]]\nIn 55 and 54 BC, [[Roman Republic|Roman]] general and future dictator [[Gaius Julius Caesar]] launched two [[Caesar's invasions of Britain|separate invasions]] of the British Isles, though neither resulted in a full Roman occupation of the island.\n\nIn 43 AD, southern Britain became part of the [[Roman Empire]]. On [[Nero]]'s accession Roman Britain extended as far north as [[Lindum Colonia|Lindum]] ([[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]]). [[Gaius Suetonius Paulinus]], the conqueror of [[Mauretania]] (modern-day [[Algeria]] and [[Morocco]]), then became [[List of governors of Roman Britain|governor of Britain]], where he spent most of his governorship campaigning in Wales. Eventually in 60 AD he penned up the last resistance and the last of the [[druid]]s in the island of [[Roman conquest of Anglesey|Mona]] ([[Anglesey]]). Paulinus led his army across the [[Menai Strait]] and massacred the druids and burnt their sacred groves. At the moment of triumph, news came of the Boudican revolt in [[East Anglia]].\n\nThe [[Defeat of Boudica|suppression of the Boudican revolt]] was followed by a period of expansion of the Roman province, including the subjugation of south Wales. Between 77 and 83 AD the new governor [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola]] led a series of campaigns which enlarged the province significantly, taking in north Wales, northern Britain, and most of [[Caledonia]] (Scotland). The [[Celtic Britons|Celts]] fought with determination and resilience, but faced a superior, professional army, and it is likely that between 100,000 and 250,000 may have perished in the [[Roman conquest of Britain|conquest]] period.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Copeland |first1=Tim |title=Life in a Roman Legionary Fortress |date=2014 |publisher=Amberley Publishing Limited |page=14}}</ref>\n\n==Medieval period==\n{{main|Medieval England|Medieval Scotland|Medieval Wales|Early medieval Ireland|Late medieval Ireland}}\n\n===Early medieval===\n<!--for the sources of this section, see the article Anglo-Saxon England, of which this is a summary.-->\nThe Early medieval period saw a series of [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain|invasions of Britain]] by the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]]-speaking [[Saxons]], beginning in the 5th century. Anglo-Saxon kingdoms were formed and, through wars with British states, gradually came to cover the territory of present-day England. Around 600, seven principal kingdoms had emerged, beginning the so-called period of the [[Heptarchy]]. During that period, the Anglo-Saxon states were [[Anglo-Saxon Christianity|Christianised]] (the conversion of the British ones had begun much earlier). In the 9th century, [[Vikings]] from [[Scandinavia]] [[Danelaw|conquered most of England]]. Only the Kingdom of Wessex under [[Alfred the Great]] survived and even managed to re-conquer and unify England for much of the 10th century, before a new series of Danish raids in the late 10th century and early 11th century culminated in the wholesale subjugation of England to Denmark under [[Canute the Great]]. Danish rule was overthrown and the local House of Wessex was restored to power under [[Edward the Confessor]] for about two decades until his death in 1066.\n\n===Late Medieval===\n[[File:Bayeux Tapestry WillelmDux.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Bayeux Tapestry]] depicting events leading to the [[Norman conquest of England]], which defined much of the subsequent history of the British Isles]]\nIn 1066, [[William, Duke of Normandy]] said he was the rightful heir to the English throne, invaded England, and defeated King [[Harold Godwinson|Harold II]] at the [[Battle of Hastings]]. Proclaiming himself to be King William I, he strengthened his regime by appointing loyal members of the Norman elite to many positions of authority, building a system of castles across the country and ordering a census of his new kingdom, the [[Domesday Book]]. The Late Medieval period was characterised by many battles between England and France, coming to a head in the Hundred Years' War from which France emerged victorious. The monarchs throughout the Late Medieval period belonged to the houses of Plantaganet, Lancaster and York.\n\n==Early modern period==\n{{main|Early modern Britain|History of Ireland (1536\u20131691)|History of Ireland (1691\u20131801)}}\n\nMajor historical events in the early modern period include the [[English Renaissance]], the [[English Reformation]] and [[Scottish Reformation]], the [[English Civil War]], the Restoration of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], the [[Glorious Revolution]], the [[Treaty of Union]], the [[Scottish Enlightenment]] and the formation of the [[First British Empire]].\n\n==19th century==\n{{main|United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland}}\n\n===1801 to 1837===\n{{further|Georgian era|British Regency|Victorian era|British Empire|Georgian society}}\n\n====Union of Great Britain and Ireland====\nThe [[Kingdom of Ireland]] was a settler state; the monarch was the incumbent monarch of England and later of Great Britain. The [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] headed the government on behalf of the monarch. He was assisted by the [[Chief Secretary of Ireland]]. Both were responsible to the government in London rather than to the [[Parliament of Ireland]]. Before the [[Constitution of 1782]], the Irish parliament was also [[Poynings' Law (on certification of acts)|severely fettered]], and decisions in Irish courts could be overturned on appeal to the British [[House of Lords]] in London.\n\nIreland gained a degree of independence in the 1780s thanks to [[Henry Grattan]]. During this time the effects of the [[Penal laws (Ireland)|penal laws]] on the primarily Roman Catholic population were reduced, and some property-owning Catholics were granted the franchise in 1794; however, they were still excluded from becoming members of the [[Irish House of Commons]]. This brief period of limited independence came to an end following the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]], which occurred during the [[French Revolutionary Wars|British war with revolutionary France]]. The British government's fear of an independent Ireland siding against them with the French resulted in the decision to unite the two countries. This was brought about by [[Acts of Union 1800|legislation in the parliaments of both kingdoms]] and came into effect on 1 January 1801. The Irish had been led to believe by the British that their loss of legislative independence would be compensated for with [[Catholic Emancipation]], i.e. by the removal of [[civil disabilities placed upon Roman Catholics]] in both Great Britain and Ireland. However, [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] was bitterly opposed to any such Emancipation and succeeded in defeating his government's attempts to introduce it. {{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\n====Napoleonic Wars====\n{{further|Napoleonic Wars}}\nDuring the [[War of the Second Coalition]] (1799\u20131801), Britain occupied most of the French and Dutch overseas possessions, the Netherlands having become a satellite state of France in 1796, but [[tropical diseases]] claimed the lives of over 40,000 troops. When the [[Treaty of Amiens]] ended the war, Britain agreed to return most of the territories it had seized. The peace settlement was in effect only a ceasefire, and Napoleon continued to provoke the British by attempting a trade [[embargo]] on the country and by occupying the city of [[Hanover]], capital of the [[Electorate of Hanover|Electorate]], a German-speaking duchy which was in a [[personal union]] with the United Kingdom. In May 1803, war was declared again. [[Napoleon]]'s plans to invade Britain failed, chiefly due to the inferiority of his navy, and in 1805 Lord Nelson's [[Royal Navy]] fleet decisively defeated the French and Spanish at [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]], ending any hopes Napoleon had to wrest control of the oceans away from the British.<ref>Roy Adkins, ''Nelson's Trafalgar: The Battle That Changed the World'' (2006)</ref>\n[[File:Trafalgar-Auguste Mayer.jpg|thumb|The British [[HMS Sandwich (1759)|HMS ''Sandwich'']] fires to the French [[flagship]] ''[[French ship Bucentaure (1803)|Bucentaure]]'' (completely dismasted) into battle off [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]]. The ''Bucentaure'' also fights [[HMS Victory|HMS ''Victory'']] (behind her) and [[HMS Temeraire (1798)|HMS ''Temeraire'']] (left side of the picture). In fact, HMS ''Sandwich'' never fought at Trafalgar, it is a mistake from [[Auguste \u00c9tienne Fran\u00e7ois Mayer|Auguste Mayer]], the painter.<ref>[http://www.musee-marine.fr/cartel2.php?id=55 Auguste Mayer's picture as described by the official website of the Mus\u00e9e national de la Marine (in French)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100526163947/http://www.musee-marine.fr/cartel2.php?id=55 |date=2010-05-26 }}</ref>]]\n\nIn 1806, Napoleon issued the series of [[Berlin Decree]]s, which brought into effect the [[Continental System]]. This policy aimed to eliminate the threat from the British by closing French-controlled territory to foreign trade. The [[British Army]] remained a minimal threat to France; it maintained a standing strength of just 220,000 men at the height of the Napoleonic Wars, whereas France's armies exceeded a million men\u2014in addition to the armies of numerous allies and several hundred thousand [[National Guard (France)|national guardsmen]] that Napoleon could draft into the French armies when they were needed. Although the Royal Navy effectively disrupted France's extra-continental trade\u2014both by seizing and threatening French shipping and by seizing French colonial possessions\u2014it could do nothing about France's trade with  the major continental economies and posed little threat to French territory in Europe. France's population and agricultural capacity far outstripped that of Britain.<ref>David A. Bell, ''The First Total War: Napoleon's Europe and the Birth of Warfare as We Know It'' (2007)</ref>\n\nTop French  leaders argued that cutting the British off from the European mainland would end their economic hegemony, but the United Kingdom possessed the greatest industrial capacity in the world, and its mastery of the seas allowed it to build up considerable economic strength through trade to its possessions from its rapidly expanding new Empire. In terms of economic damage to Britain, the blockade was largely ineffective. As Napoleon realized that extensive trade was going through Spain and Russia, he invaded those two countries. He tied down his forces in Spain, and lost very badly in Russia in 1812.<ref>J. M. Thompson, ''Napoleon Bonaparte: His rise and fall '' (1951) pp 235-40</ref> The Spanish uprising in 1808 at last permitted Britain to gain a foothold on the Continent. The Duke of Wellington and his army of British and Portuguese gradually pushed the French out of Spain, and in early 1814, as Napoleon was being driven back in the east by the Prussians, Austrians, and Russians, Wellington invaded southern France. After Napoleon's surrender and exile to the island of Elba, peace appeared to have returned, but when he escaped back into France in 1815, the British and their allies had to fight him again. The armies of Wellington and Blucher defeated Napoleon once and for all at Waterloo.<ref>R.E. Foster, ''Wellington and Waterloo: The Duke, the Battle and Posterity 1815-2015'' (2014)</ref>\n\n[[File:Signing of Treaty of Ghent (1814).jpg|thumb|left|Signing of the [[Treaty of Ghent]] With the United States (1814), by A. Forestier ]]\nSimultaneous with the Napoleonic Wars, trade disputes and British impressment of American sailors led to the [[War of 1812]] with the United States. A central event in American history, it was little noticed in Britain, where all attention was focused on the struggle with France. The British could devote few resources to the conflict until the fall of Napoleon in 1814. American frigates also inflicted a series of embarrassing defeats on the British navy, which was short on manpower due to the conflict in Europe.\n\nA stepped-up war effort that year brought about some successes such as the burning of [[Washington, D.C.]], but the Duke of Wellington argued that an outright victory over the U.S. was impossible because the Americans controlled the western Great Lakes and had destroyed the power of Britain's Indian allies. A full-scale British invasion was defeated in upstate New York. Peace was agreed to at the end of 1814, but unaware of this, [[Andrew Jackson]] won a great victory over the British at the [[Battle of New Orleans]] in January 1815 (news took several weeks to cross the Atlantic before the advent of steam ships). The Treaty of Ghent subsequently ended the war with no territorial changes.  It was the last war between Britain and the United States.<ref>Jeremy Black, ''The War of 1812 in the Age of Napoleon'' (2009)</ref>\n\n====George IV and William IV====\nBritain emerged from the Napoleonic Wars a very different country than it had been in 1793. As industrialisation progressed, society changed, becoming more urban and less rural. The postwar period saw an economic slump, and poor harvests and inflation caused widespread social unrest. Europe after 1815 was on guard against a return of Jacobinism, and even liberal Britain saw the passage of the Six Acts in 1819, which proscribed radical activities. By the end of the 1820s, along with a general economic recovery, many of these repressive laws were repealed  and in 1828 new legislation guaranteed the civil rights of religious dissenters.\n\nA weak ruler as regent (1811\u201320) and king (1820\u201330), George IV let his ministers take full charge of government affairs, playing a far lesser role than his father, George III. His governments, with little help from the king, presided over victory in the Napoleonic Wars, negotiated the peace settlement, and attempted to deal with the social and economic malaise that followed.<ref>Kenneth Baker, \"George IV: a Sketch,\" ''History Today'' 2005 55(10): 30\u201336.</ref> His brother [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]] ruled (1830\u201337), but was little involved in politics. His reign saw several reforms: the [[poor law]] was updated, [[child labour]] restricted, [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|slavery abolished]] in nearly all the [[British Empire]], and, most important, the [[Reform Act 1832]] refashioned the British electoral system.<ref>[[Brock, Michael]] (2004) \"William IV (1765\u20131837)\", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography,'' (2004) {{doi|10.1093/ref:odnb/29451}}</ref>\n\nThere were no major wars until the [[Crimean War]] (1853\u201356).<ref>Jeremy Black, ''A military history of Britain: from 1775 to the present'' (2008), pp. 74\u201377</ref> While Prussia, Austria, and Russia, as absolute monarchies, tried to suppress liberalism wherever it might occur, the British came to terms with new ideas. Britain intervened in Portugal in 1826 to defend a constitutional government there and recognising the independence of Spain's American colonies in 1824.<ref>William W. Kaufmann, ''British policy and the independence of Latin America, 1804\u20131828'' (1967)</ref> British merchants and financiers, and later railway builders, played major roles in the economies of most Latin American nations.<ref>Will Kaufman and Heidi Slettedahl Macpherson (eds). ''Britain and the Americas: culture, politics, and history'' (2004), pp. 465\u201368</ref>\n\n====Whig reforms of the 1830s====\nThe [[Whig (British political party)|Whig Party]] recovered its strength and unity by supporting moral reforms, especially the reform of the electoral system, the abolition of slavery and emancipation of the Catholics. [[Catholic emancipation]] was secured in the Catholic Relief Act of 1829, which removed the most substantial restrictions on Roman Catholics in Great Britain and Ireland.<ref name=\"L. Woodward, 1938 pp 325\u201330\">E. L. Woodward, ''The Age of Reform, 1815\u20131870'' (1938), pp. 325\u201330</ref>\n\nThe Whigs became champions of Parliamentary reform. They made [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Lord Grey]] prime minister 1830\u20131834, and the [[Reform Act 1832|Reform Act of 1832]] became their signature measure. It broadened the franchise and ended the system of \"rotten borough\" and \"pocket boroughs\" (where elections were controlled by powerful families), and instead redistributed power on the basis of population. It added 217,000 voters to an electorate of 435,000 in England and Wales. The main effect of the act was to weaken the power of the landed gentry, and enlarge the power of the professional and business middle-class, which now for the first time had a significant voice in Parliament. However, the great majority of manual workers, clerks, and farmers did not have enough property to qualify to vote. The aristocracy continued to dominate the government, the Army and Royal Navy, and high society.<ref name=\"L. Woodward, 1938 pp 325\u201330\"/> After parliamentary investigations demonstrated the horrors of child labour, limited reforms were passed in 1833.\n\n[[Chartism]] emerged after the 1832 Reform Bill failed to give the vote  to the working class. Activists denounced the \"betrayal\" of the working classes and the \"sacrificing\" of their \"interests\" by the \"misconduct\" of the government. In 1838, Chartists issued the People's Charter demanding manhood suffrage, equal sized election districts, voting by ballots, payment of Members of Parliament (so that poor men could serve), annual Parliaments, and abolition of property requirements. The [[ruling class]] saw the movement as pathological, {{Clarify|date=September 2013}} so the Chartists were unable to force serious constitutional debate. Historians see Chartism as both a continuation of the 18th century fight against corruption and as a new stage in demands for democracy in an industrial society.<ref>Malcolm Chase. ''Chartism: A New History'' (2007)</ref> In 1832 Parliament abolished slavery in the Empire with the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833]]. The government purchased the slaves for \u00a320,000,000 (the money went to rich plantation owners who mostly lived in England), and freed the slaves, especially those in the Caribbean sugar islands.<ref>E.

Scholars debate whether the Victorian period\u2014as defined by a variety of sensibilities and political concerns that have come to be associated with the Victorians\u2014actually begins with the passage of the [[Reform Act 1832]]. The era was preceded by the [[Regency era]] and succeeded by the [[Edwardian period]]. Victoria became queen in 1837 at age 18. Her long reign saw Britain reach the zenith of its economic and political power, with the introduction of steam ships, railroads, photography, and the telegraph. Britain again remained mostly inactive in Continental politics. {{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\n====Foreign policy====\n\n====Free trade imperialism====\nThe Great London Exhibition of 1851 clearly demonstrated Britain's dominance in engineering and industry; that lasted until the rise of the United States and Germany in the 1890s. Using the imperial tools of free trade and financial investment,<ref>Bernard Semmel, ''The Rise of Free Trade Imperialism'' (Cambridge University Press, 1970) ch 1</ref> it exerted major influence on many countries outside Europe, especially in [[Latin America]] and [[Asia]]. Thus Britain had both a formal Empire based on British rule as well as an informal one based on the British pound.<ref>David McLean. \"Finance and \"Informal Empire\" before the First World War\", [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2594316 ''Economic History Review'' (1976) 29#2 pp. 291\u2013305], at jstor.org</ref>\n\n====Russia, France and the Ottoman Empire====\nOne nagging fear was the possible collapse of the Ottoman Empire. It was well understood that a collapse of that country would set off a scramble for its territory and possibly plunge Britain into war. To head that off Britain sought to keep the Russians from occupying Constantinople and taking over the [[Bosporous Straits]], as well as from [[The Great Game|threatening India via Afghanistan]].<ref>Roman Golicz. \"The Russians Shall Not Have Constantinople\", ''History Today'' (2003) 53#9, pp. 39\u201345</ref> In 1853, Britain and France intervened in the [[Crimean War]] against Russia.

Prince Albert was effective in defusing a [[Trent Affair|war scare in late 1861]]. The British people, however, who depended heavily on American food imports, generally favoured the Union. What little cotton was available came from New York, as the blockade by the US Navy shut down 95% of Southern exports to Britain. In September 1862, [[Abraham Lincoln]] announced the [[Emancipation Proclamation]]. Since support of the Confederacy now meant supporting the institution of slavery, there was no possibility of European intervention.<ref>Amanda Foreman. ''A World on Fire: Britain's Crucial Role in the American Civil War'' (2012)<!-- ISBN needed --></ref> The British sold arms to both sides, built blockade runners for a lucrative trade with the Confederacy, and surreptitiously allowed warships to be built for the Confederacy.

Several of the colonies temporarily refused to join the Dominion despite pressure from both Canada and Britain; the last one, [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]], held out until 1949. The second half of the 19th century saw a [[scramble for Africa|huge expansion]] of Britain's colonial empire, mostly in [[Africa]]. A talk of the Union Jack flying \"from Cairo to Cape Town\" only became a reality at the end of the [[World War I|Great War]]. Having possessions on six continents, Britain had to defend all of its empire and did so with a volunteer army, the only [[great power]] in Europe to have no conscription. Some questioned whether the country was overstretched.\n\nThe rise of the [[German Empire]] since its creation in 1871 posed a new challenge, for it (along with the United States), threatened to usurp Britain's place as the world's foremost industrial power. Germany acquired a number of colonies in Africa and the Pacific, but Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] succeeded in achieving general peace through his balance of power strategy. When [[William II, German Emperor|William II]] became emperor in 1888, he discarded Bismarck, began using bellicose language, and planned to build a navy to rival Britain's.<ref>A. J. P. Taylor. ''The Struggle for Mastery in Europe: 1848\u20131918'' (1953), Chapter 12{{ISBN missing}}</ref>\n\nEver since Britain had wrested control of the [[Cape Colony]] from the Netherlands during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], it had co-existed with Dutch settlers who had migrated further away from the Cape and created two republics of their own. The British imperial vision called for control over these new countries, and the Dutch-speaking \"Boers\" (or \"Afrikaners\") fought back in the [[Second Boer War|War in 1899\u20131902]]. Outgunned by a mighty empire, the Boers waged a guerrilla war (which certain other British territories would later employ to attain independence). This gave the British regulars a difficult fight, but their weight of numbers, superior equipment, and often brutal tactics, eventually brought about a British victory. The war had been costly in human rights and was widely criticised by Liberals in Britain and worldwide. However, the United States gave its support. The Boer republics were merged into the [[Union of South Africa]] in 1910; this had internal self-government, but its foreign policy was controlled by London and it was an integral part of the British Empire.<ref>Denis Judd.

However King [[George III of England|George III]] blocked emancipation, arguing that to grant it would break his [[coronation oath]] to defend the [[Anglican Communion|Anglican Church]]. A campaign by the lawyer [[Daniel O'Connell]], and the death of George III, led to the concession of Catholic Emancipation in 1829, allowing Roman Catholics to sit in the Parliament of the United Kingdom. But Catholic Emancipation was not O'Connell's ultimate goal, which was Repeal of the Act of Union with Great Britain. On 1 January 1843 O'Connell confidently, but wrongly, declared that Repeal would be achieved that year. When [[potato blight]] hit the island in 1846, much of the rural population was left without food, because [[cash crop]]s were being exported to pay rents.<ref>Christine Kinealy.

''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845\u20131849'' (1962), London, Hamish Hamilton: 31</ref>\n\nBritish politicians such as the [[Prime Minister]] [[Robert Peel]] were at this time wedded to the [[economic policy]] of [[laissez-faire]],  which argued against state intervention. While funds were raised by private individuals and charities, lack of adequate action let the problem become a catastrophe. Cottiers (or farm labourers) were largely wiped out during what is known in Ireland as the \"[[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Hunger]]\". A significant minority elected [[Unionism in Ireland|Unionists]], who championed the Union. A [[Church of Ireland]] former [[Tory]] barrister turned nationalist campaigner, [[Isaac Butt]], established a new moderate nationalist movement, the [[Home Rule League]], in the 1870s. After Butt's death the Home Rule Movement, or the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] as it had become known, was turned into a major political force under the guidance of [[William Shaw (Irish politician)|William Shaw]] and a radical young Protestant landowner, [[Charles Stewart Parnell]]. {{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nParnell's movement campaigned for \"Home Rule\", by which they meant that Ireland would govern itself as a region within the United Kingdom. Two Home Rule Bills (1886 and 1893) were introduced by Liberal Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]], but neither became law, mainly due to opposition from the Conservative Party and the [[House of Lords]]. The issue was a source of contention throughout Ireland, as a significant majority of [[Unionism in Ireland|Unionists]] (largely but not exclusively based in [[Ulster]]), opposed Home Rule, fearing that a [[Rome Rule|Catholic Nationalist]] (\"Rome Rule\") Parliament in Dublin would discriminate or retaliate against them, impose Roman Catholic doctrine, and impose tariffs on industry. While most of Ireland was primarily agricultural, six of the counties in Ulster were the location of heavy industry and would be affected by any tariff barriers imposed. {{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\n==20th century to present==\n{{main|History of the United Kingdom|History of the Republic of Ireland}}\n\n===1900\u20131945===\nAt the turn of the century, Britain was involved in the [[Second Boer War]] in [[South Africa]].\n\n[[Queen Victoria]], who had reigned since 1837, died in 1901 and was succeeded by her son, [[Edward VII]], who, in turn, was succeeded by [[George V]] in 1910.\n\nIn 1914, Britain entered the [[World War I|First World War]] by declaring war on [[German Empire|Germany]]. Nearly a million Britons were killed in the war, which lasted until Germany's surrender on 11 November 1918.\n\nHome Rule in Ireland, which had been a major political issue since the late 19th century but put on hold by the war, was somewhat resolved after the [[Irish War of Independence]] brought the British Government to a stalemate in 1922. Negotiations led to the formation of the [[Irish Free State]]. However, in order to appease Unionists in the north, the north-eastern six counties remained as part of the U.K., forming Northern Ireland with its own Parliament at Stormont in Belfast.\n\nHaving been in power for much of the early 20th century under Prime Ministers [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman|Campbell-Bannerman]], [[H. H. Asquith|Asquith]] and [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]], the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal party]] suffered a sharp decline from 1922; the newly formed [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour party]], whose leader [[Ramsay MacDonald]] led two minority governments, swiftly became the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]]' main opposition, and Britain's largest party of the left.\n\nKing [[Edward VIII]] succeeded his father George V in January 1936, but was quickly met with difficulties due to his love affair with [[Wallis Simpson]], an American who had already been married twice. In December, he decided to abdicate in order to be able to marry Simpson, and his brother [[George VI]] was crowned king.\n\nIn order to avoid another European conflict, Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]] attempted to appease German Chancellor [[Adolf Hitler]], who was expanding his country's territory across Central Europe. Despite proclaiming that he has achieved \"peace for our time\", Britain declared war on Germany on 3 September 1939, following Hitler's invasion of Poland two days earlier. The U.K. thus joined the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] in opposition to the Axis forces of [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]]. For the first time, civilians were not exempt from the war, as London suffered nightly bombings during [[the Blitz]]. Much of London was destroyed, with 1,400,245 buildings destroyed or damaged.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Clodfelter|first1=Micheal|title=Warfare and Armed Conflicts: A Statistical Encyclopedia of Casualty and Other Figures, 1492-2015, 4th ed|date=2017|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0786474707|page=441}}</ref> At the war's end in 1945, however, the U.K. emerged as one of the victorious nations.\n\n===1945\u20131997===\n[[Winston Churchill]], who had been leader of the wartime coalition government, suffered a surprising landslide defeat to [[Clement Attlee]]'s Labour party in 1945 elections. Attlee created a [[Welfare State]] in Britain, which most notably provided free healthcare under the [[National Health Service]]. By the late 1940s, the [[Cold War]] was underway, which would dominate British foreign policy for another 40 years.\n\nIn 1951, Churchill and the Tories returned to power; they would govern uninterrupted for the next 13 years. King [[George VI]] died in 1952, and was succeeded by his eldest daughter, [[Elizabeth II]].\n\nChurchill was succeeded in 1955 by [[Sir Anthony Eden]], whose premiership was dominated by the [[Suez Crisis]], in which Britain, France and Israel plotted to bomb Egypt after its President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]] nationalised the [[Suez Canal]]. Eden's successor, Harold Macmillan, split the Conservatives when Britain applied to join the [[European Economic Community]], but French President [[Charles de Gaulle]] vetoed the application.\n\nLabour returned to power in 1964 under [[Harold Wilson]], who brought in a number of social reforms, including the legalisation of abortion, the abolition of capital punishment and the decriminalisation of homosexuality. In 1973, Conservative Prime Minister Edward Heath succeeded in securing U.K. membership in the European Economic Community (EEC), what would later become known as the European Union. Wilson, having lost the 1970 election to Heath, returned to power in 1974; however, Labour's reputation was harmed by the [[winter of discontent]] of 1978-9 under Jim Callaghan, which enabled the Conservatives to re-take control of Parliament in 1979, under [[Margaret Thatcher]], Britain's first female Prime Minister.\n\nAlthough Thatcher's economic reforms made her initially unpopular, her decision in 1982 to retake the [[Falkland Islands]] from invading [[Argentine]] forces, in what would become known as the [[Falklands War]], changed her fortunes and enabled a [[landslide victory]] in 1983. After winning an unprecedented third election in 1987, however, Thatcher's popularity began to fade and she was replaced by former chancellor [[John Major]] in 1990.\n\nTensions between Protestants and Catholics in Northern Ireland came to a head in the late 1960s, when nationalist participants in a civil rights march were shot by members of the [[B Specials]], a reserve police force manned almost exclusively by unionists. From this point the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]], also known as the Provos or simply the IRA, began a bombing campaign throughout the U.K., beginning a period known as [[The Troubles]], which lasted until the late 1990s.\n\n[[Prince Charles]], the Prince of Wales and Elizabeth's eldest son married [[Lady Diana Spencer]] in 1981; the couple had two children, William and Harry, but divorced in 1992, during which year Prince Andrew and Princess Anne also separated from their spouses, leading the Queen to call the year her '[[annus horribilis]]'. In 1997, Diana was killed in a car crash in Paris, leading to a mass outpouring of grief across the United Kingdom, and indeed the world.\n\nOn the international stage, the second half of the 20th century was dominated by the [[Cold War]] between the Soviet Union and its socialist allies and the United States and its capitalist allies; the U.K. was a key supporter of the latter, joining the anti-Soviet military alliance [[NATO]] in 1949. During this period, the U.K. became involved in several Cold War conflicts, such as the [[Korean War]] (1950\u20131953). In contrast, the Republic of Ireland remained neutral and provided troops to U.N. peace-keeping missions.\n\n===1997\u2013present===\nIn 1997, [[Tony Blair]] was elected prime minister in a landslide victory for the so-called '[[New Labour]]', economically following '[[Third Way (centrism)|Third Way]]' programmes. Blair won re-election in 2001 and 2005, before handing over power to his chancellor [[Gordon Brown]] in 2007. After a decade of prosperity both the U.K. and the Irish Republic were affected by the global recession, which began in 2008. In 2010, the Conservative party formed a coalition government with the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], with Tory leader [[David Cameron]] as Prime Minister. In 2015 polling suggested a [[hung parliament]] was the most likely outcome in the General Election; however the Conservatives secured a slim majority.\n\nAfter the [[September 11 Attacks]], the U.K. supported the U.S. in their \"[[War on Terror]]\", and joined them in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)]] and the [[Iraq War|invasion of Iraq]]. London was attacked in [[7 July 2005 London bombings|July 2005]]. The U.K. also took a leading role in the [[2011 military intervention in Libya]]. In a [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|referendum in 2016]], the U.K. voted to leave the [[European Union]].\n\nAfter becoming Prime Minister and leader of the Conservative Party shortly after David Cameron's resignation following the Brexit result, an [[2017 United Kingdom general election|election]] was called by the incumbent Prime Minister [[Theresa May]] (the former Home Secretary), in an attempt to gain a larger majority for Brexit negotiations and also as an advantage, as the Labour Party were doing badly in the [[Opinion polling for the United Kingdom general election, 2017|polls]], the Conservative Party lost their majority despite winning a record number of votes, and were restricted to forming a \"supply and confidence\" deal, yet not a formal coalition with the Northern Irish unionist party, the [[Democratic Unionist Party|DUP]] in order to have a working majority in the House of Commons.\n\n==Periods==\n{{See also|History of Ireland}}\n\n* [[Prehistoric Britain]] (Prehistory\u2013AD 43)\n** [[Prehistoric Scotland]]\n** [[Prehistoric Wales]]\n* [[Roman Britain]] (44\u2013407)\n* [[Sub-Roman Britain]] (407\u2013597)\n* [[Great Britain in the Middle Ages|Britain in the Middle Ages]] (597\u20131485)\n** [[Anglo-Saxon England]] (597\u20131066)\n** [[Scotland in the Early Middle Ages]] (400\u2013900)\n** [[Scotland in the High Middle Ages]] (900\u20131286)\n** [[Norman Conquest of England]] (1066)\n** [[Scotland in the Late Middle Ages]] (1286\u20131513)\n*** [[Wars of Scottish Independence]] (1296\u20131357)\n** [[Wales in the Middle Ages]] (411-1542)\n* [[Early modern Britain]]\n** [[Tudor period]] (1485\u20131603)\n***[[Tudor conquest of Ireland]]\n*** [[English Renaissance]]\n*** [[Elizabethan era]] (1558\u20131603)\n** [[First British Empire]] (1583\u20131783)\n** [[Jacobean era]] (1567\u20131625)\n** [[Union of the Crowns]] (1603)\n** [[Caroline era]] (1625\u20131642)\n** [[English Civil War]] (1642\u20131651)\n** [[English Interregnum]] (1651\u20131660)\n** [[English Restoration|Restoration]] (1660)\n** [[Glorious Revolution]] (1688)\n** [[Scottish Enlightenment]]\n** [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] (1707\u20131800)\n** [[Second British Empire]] (1783\u20131815)\n** [[Georgian era]]\n* [[History of the United Kingdom]] (1801\u2013)\n**[[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] (1801\u20131922)\n*** [[Britain's Imperial Century]] (1815\u20131914)\n*** [[British Regency|Regency]] (1811\u20131820)\n*** [[Victorian era]] (1837\u20131901)\n*** [[Edwardian period]] (1901\u20131910)\n*** [[Britain in World War I]] (1914\u20131918)\n*** [[Coalition Government 1916\u20131922]]\n**[[United Kingdom]] of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (1922\u2013)\n***[[Conservative Government 1922\u20131924]]\n***[[Conservative Government 1924\u20131929]]\n***[[Labour Government 1929\u20131931]]\n***[[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]] (1931\u20131940)\n***[[Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II|Britain in World War II]] (1939\u20131945)\n***[[History of the United Kingdom (1945\u2013present)]]\n***[[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher]] (1979\u20131990)\n***[[Premiership of Tony Blair]] (1997\u20132007)\n***[[Premiership of Gordon Brown]] (2007\u20132010)\n***[[Premiership of David Cameron]] (2010\u20132016)\n***[[Premiership of Theresa May]] (2016\u20132019)\n***[[Premiership of Boris Johnson]] (2019\u2013)\n*[[History of the Republic of Ireland]] (1922\u2013)\n**[[Irish civil war]]\n\n==Timeline history of the British Isles==\n{{Timeline history of the British Isles}}\n\n==Geographic==\n* [[History of England]] ([[Timeline of English history|Timeline]])\n** [[History of Cornwall]]\n** [[History of London]]\n* [[History of Scotland]]\n* [[History of Wales]]\n* [[History of Ireland]]\n** [[History of Northern Ireland]]\n** [[History of the Republic of Ireland]] ([[Timeline of Irish history|Timeline]])\n* [[History of the Isle of Man]]\n* [[History of Jersey]]\n\n===States===\n* [[England in the Middle Ages]]\n* [[Kingdom of England]] (to 1707)\n* [[Kingdom of Scotland]] (to 1707)\n* [[Kingdom of Ireland]] (1541\u20131801)\n* [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] (1707\u20131801)\n* [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] (1801\u20131927)\n* [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]] (1927 \u2013 )\n* [[Isle of Man]] (unrecorded date to present)\n\n===Supranational===\n* [[British Empire]]\n* [[Commonwealth of Nations]]\n* [[European Union]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[Timeline of the British Army]]\n* [[Timeline of British diplomatic history]]\n* [[British military history]]\n*[[List of British monarchs]]\n**[[British monarchs' family tree]]\n* [[Economic history of the United Kingdom]]\n* [[History of British society]]\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*<cite>[[A History of Britain (book)|A History of Britain]]: At the Edge of the World, 3500 BC -

There are also three [[Crown dependencies]]: [[Guernsey]], [[Jersey]] and the [[Isle of Man]].  The United Kingdom comprises [[England]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Scotland]], and [[Wales]], each [[countries of the United Kingdom|country]] having its own history, with all but Northern Ireland having been independent states at one point. The [[history of the formation of the United Kingdom]] is very complex.\n\nThe [[British monarch]] was [[head of state]] of all of the countries of the British Isles from the [[Union of the Crowns]] in 1603 until the enactment of the [[Republic of Ireland Act]] in 1949, although the term \"British Isles\" was not used in 1603.  Additionally, since the independence of most of Ireland, historians of the region often avoid the term ''British Isles'' due to the complexity of relations between the peoples of the [[archipelago]] (see: ''[[Terminology of the British Isles]]'').\n\n==Prehistoric==\n{{Main|Prehistoric Britain|Prehistoric Ireland}}\n\n===Palaeolithic and Mesolithic periods===\nThe [[Palaeolithic]] and [[Mesolithic]], also known as the Old and Middle Stone Ages, were characterised by a [[hunter-gatherer]] economy and a reliance on stone tool technologies.\n\n====Palaeolithic====\nThe [[Prehistoric Britain|Lower Palaeolithic period in the British Isles]] saw the region's first known habitation by early hominids, specifically the extinct [[Homo heidelbergensis]].\n\nOne of the most prominent archaeological sites dating to this period is that of [[Boxgrove Quarry]] in West Sussex, southern [[England]].\n\n====Mesolithic (10,000 to 4,500 BC)====\nBy the Mesolithic, ''[[Homo sapiens]]'', or modern humans, were the only hominid species to still survive in the British Isles.\nBritish Isles were linked to continental Europe by a territory named [[Doggerland]].\n\n===Neolithic and Bronze Ages (4500 to 600 BC)===\n{{main|Neolithic British Isles|Bronze Age Britain|Bronze Age Ireland}}\n\nIn the British Isles, the Neolithic and Bronze Ages saw the transformation of British and Irish society and landscape. It saw the adoption of agriculture, as communities gave up their hunter-gatherer modes of existence to begin farming.\n\n===Iron Age (1200 BC to 600 AD)===\n{{main|British Iron Age|Irish Iron Age}}\n\nAs its name suggests, the British Iron Age is also characterised by the adoption of [[iron]], a metal which was used to produce a variety of different tools, ornaments and weapons.\n\nIn the course of the first millennium BC, and possibly earlier, some combination of [[trans-cultural diffusion]] and immigration from continental Europe resulted in the establishment of [[Celtic languages]] in the islands, eventually giving rise to the [[Insular Celtic languages|Insular Celtic]] group. What languages were spoken in the islands before is unknown, though they are assumed to have been [[Pre-Indo-European languages|Pre-Indo-European]].\n\n==Classical period==\n{{main|Roman Britain|Wales in the Roman era|Scotland during the Roman Empire}}\n[[File:End.of.Roman.rule.in.Britain.383.410.jpg|thumb|[[End of Roman rule in Britain]], 383\u2013410]]\nIn 55 and 54 BC, [[Roman Republic|Roman]] general and future dictator [[Gaius Julius Caesar]] launched two [[Caesar's invasions of Britain|separate invasions]] of the British Isles, though neither resulted in a full Roman occupation of the island.\n\nIn 43 AD, southern Britain became part of the [[Roman Empire]]. On [[Nero]]'s accession Roman Britain extended as far north as [[Lindum Colonia|Lindum]] ([[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]]). [[Gaius Suetonius Paulinus]], the conqueror of [[Mauretania]] (modern-day [[Algeria]] and [[Morocco]]), then became [[List of governors of Roman Britain|governor of Britain]], where he spent most of his governorship campaigning in Wales. Eventually in 60 AD he penned up the last resistance and the last of the [[druid]]s in the island of [[Roman conquest of Anglesey|Mona]] ([[Anglesey]]). Paulinus led his army across the [[Menai Strait]] and massacred the druids and burnt their sacred groves. At the moment of triumph, news came of the Boudican revolt in [[East Anglia]].\n\nThe [[Defeat of Boudica|suppression of the Boudican revolt]] was followed by a period of expansion of the Roman province, including the subjugation of south Wales. Between 77 and 83 AD the new governor [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola]] led a series of campaigns which enlarged the province significantly, taking in north Wales, northern Britain, and most of [[Caledonia]] (Scotland). The [[Celtic Britons|Celts]] fought with determination and resilience, but faced a superior, professional army, and it is likely that between 100,000 and 250,000 may have perished in the [[Roman conquest of Britain|conquest]] period.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Copeland |first1=Tim |title=Life in a Roman Legionary Fortress |date=2014 |publisher=Amberley Publishing Limited |page=14}}</ref>\n\n==Medieval period==\n{{main|Medieval England|Medieval Scotland|Medieval Wales|Early medieval Ireland|Late medieval Ireland}}\n\n===Early medieval===\n<!--for the sources of this section, see the article Anglo-Saxon England, of which this is a summary.-->\nThe Early medieval period saw a series of [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain|invasions of Britain]] by the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]]-speaking [[Saxons]], beginning in the 5th century. Anglo-Saxon kingdoms were formed and, through wars with British states, gradually came to cover the territory of present-day England. Around 600, seven principal kingdoms had emerged, beginning the so-called period of the [[Heptarchy]]. During that period, the Anglo-Saxon states were [[Anglo-Saxon Christianity|Christianised]] (the conversion of the British ones had begun much earlier). In the 9th century, [[Vikings]] from [[Scandinavia]] [[Danelaw|conquered most of England]]. Only the Kingdom of Wessex under [[Alfred the Great]] survived and even managed to re-conquer and unify England for much of the 10th century, before a new series of Danish raids in the late 10th century and early 11th century culminated in the wholesale subjugation of England to Denmark under [[Canute the Great]]. Danish rule was overthrown and the local House of Wessex was restored to power under [[Edward the Confessor]] for about two decades until his death in 1066.\n\n===Late Medieval===\n[[File:Bayeux Tapestry WillelmDux.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Bayeux Tapestry]] depicting events leading to the [[Norman conquest of England]], which defined much of the subsequent history of the British Isles]]\nIn 1066, [[William, Duke of Normandy]] said he was the rightful heir to the English throne, invaded England, and defeated King [[Harold Godwinson|Harold II]] at the [[Battle of Hastings]]. Proclaiming himself to be King William I, he strengthened his regime by appointing loyal members of the Norman elite to many positions of authority, building a system of castles across the country and ordering a census of his new kingdom, the [[Domesday Book]]. The Late Medieval period was characterised by many battles between England and France, coming to a head in the Hundred Years' War from which France emerged victorious. The monarchs throughout the Late Medieval period belonged to the houses of Plantaganet, Lancaster and York.\n\n==Early modern period==\n{{main|Early modern Britain|History of Ireland (1536\u20131691)|History of Ireland (1691\u20131801)}}\n\nMajor historical events in the early modern period include the [[English Renaissance]], the [[English Reformation]] and [[Scottish Reformation]], the [[English Civil War]], the Restoration of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], the [[Glorious Revolution]], the [[Treaty of Union]], the [[Scottish Enlightenment]] and the formation of the [[First British Empire]].\n\n==19th century==\n{{main|United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland}}\n\n===1801 to 1837===\n{{further|Georgian era|British Regency|Victorian era|British Empire|Georgian society}}\n\n====Union of Great Britain and Ireland====\nThe [[Kingdom of Ireland]] was a settler state; the monarch was the incumbent monarch of England and later of Great Britain. The [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] headed the government on behalf of the monarch. He was assisted by the [[Chief Secretary of Ireland]]. Both were responsible to the government in London rather than to the [[Parliament of Ireland]]. Before the [[Constitution of 1782]], the Irish parliament was also [[Poynings' Law (on certification of acts)|severely fettered]], and decisions in Irish courts could be overturned on appeal to the British [[House of Lords]] in London.\n\nIreland gained a degree of independence in the 1780s thanks to [[Henry Grattan]]. During this time the effects of the [[Penal laws (Ireland)|penal laws]] on the primarily Roman Catholic population were reduced, and some property-owning Catholics were granted the franchise in 1794; however, they were still excluded from becoming members of the [[Irish House of Commons]]. This brief period of limited independence came to an end following the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]], which occurred during the [[French Revolutionary Wars|British war with revolutionary France]]. The British government's fear of an independent Ireland siding against them with the French resulted in the decision to unite the two countries. This was brought about by [[Acts of Union 1800|legislation in the parliaments of both kingdoms]] and came into effect on 1 January 1801. The Irish had been led to believe by the British that their loss of legislative independence would be compensated for with [[Catholic Emancipation]], i.e. by the removal of [[civil disabilities placed upon Roman Catholics]] in both Great Britain and Ireland. However, [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] was bitterly opposed to any such Emancipation and succeeded in defeating his government's attempts to introduce it. {{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\n====Napoleonic Wars====\n{{further|Napoleonic Wars}}\nDuring the [[War of the Second Coalition]] (1799\u20131801), Britain occupied most of the French and Dutch overseas possessions, the Netherlands having become a satellite state of France in 1796, but [[tropical diseases]] claimed the lives of over 40,000 troops. When the [[Treaty of Amiens]] ended the war, Britain agreed to return most of the territories it had seized. The peace settlement was in effect only a ceasefire, and Napoleon continued to provoke the British by attempting a trade [[embargo]] on the country and by occupying the city of [[Hanover]], capital of the [[Electorate of Hanover|Electorate]], a German-speaking duchy which was in a [[personal union]] with the United Kingdom. In May 1803, war was declared again. [[Napoleon]]'s plans to invade Britain failed, chiefly due to the inferiority of his navy, and in 1805 Lord Nelson's [[Royal Navy]] fleet decisively defeated the French and Spanish at [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]], ending any hopes Napoleon had to wrest control of the oceans away from the British.<ref>Roy Adkins, ''Nelson's Trafalgar: The Battle That Changed the World'' (2006)</ref>\n[[File:Trafalgar-Auguste Mayer.jpg|thumb|The British [[HMS Sandwich (1759)|HMS ''Sandwich'']] fires to the French [[flagship]] ''[[French ship Bucentaure (1803)|Bucentaure]]'' (completely dismasted) into battle off [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]].

This policy aimed to eliminate the threat from the British by closing French-controlled territory to foreign trade. The [[British Army]] remained a minimal threat to France; it maintained a standing strength of just 220,000 men at the height of the Napoleonic Wars, whereas France's armies exceeded a million men\u2014in addition to the armies of numerous allies and several hundred thousand [[National Guard (France)|national guardsmen]] that Napoleon could draft into the French armies when they were needed. Although the Royal Navy effectively disrupted France's extra-continental trade\u2014both by seizing and threatening French shipping and by seizing French colonial possessions\u2014it could do nothing about France's trade with  the major continental economies and posed little threat to French territory in Europe. France's population and agricultural capacity far outstripped that of Britain.<ref>David A. Bell, ''The First Total War: Napoleon's Europe and the Birth of Warfare as We Know It'' (2007)</ref>\n\nTop French  leaders argued that cutting the British off from the European mainland would end their economic hegemony, but the United Kingdom possessed the greatest industrial capacity in the world, and its mastery of the seas allowed it to build up considerable economic strength through trade to its possessions from its rapidly expanding new Empire. In terms of economic damage to Britain, the blockade was largely ineffective. As Napoleon realized that extensive trade was going through Spain and Russia, he invaded those two countries. He tied down his forces in Spain, and lost very badly in Russia in 1812.<ref>J. M. Thompson, ''Napoleon Bonaparte: His rise and fall '' (1951) pp 235-40</ref> The Spanish uprising in 1808 at last permitted Britain to gain a foothold on the Continent. The Duke of Wellington and his army of British and Portuguese gradually pushed the French out of Spain, and in early 1814, as Napoleon was being driven back in the east by the Prussians, Austrians, and Russians, Wellington invaded southern France. After Napoleon's surrender and exile to the island of Elba, peace appeared to have returned, but when he escaped back into France in 1815, the British and their allies had to fight him again. The armies of Wellington and Blucher defeated Napoleon once and for all at Waterloo.<ref>R.E. Foster, ''Wellington and Waterloo: The Duke, the Battle and Posterity 1815-2015'' (2014)</ref>\n\n[[File:Signing of Treaty of Ghent (1814).jpg|thumb|left|Signing of the [[Treaty of Ghent]] With the United States (1814), by A. Forestier ]]\nSimultaneous with the Napoleonic Wars, trade disputes and British impressment of American sailors led to the [[War of 1812]] with the United States. A central event in American history, it was little noticed in Britain, where all attention was focused on the struggle with France. The British could devote few resources to the conflict until the fall of Napoleon in 1814. American frigates also inflicted a series of embarrassing defeats on the British navy, which was short on manpower due to the conflict in Europe.\n\nA stepped-up war effort that year brought about some successes such as the burning of [[Washington, D.C.]], but the Duke of Wellington argued that an outright victory over the U.S. was impossible because the Americans controlled the western Great Lakes and had destroyed the power of Britain's Indian allies. A full-scale British invasion was defeated in upstate New York. Peace was agreed to at the end of 1814, but unaware of this, [[Andrew Jackson]] won a great victory over the British at the [[Battle of New Orleans]] in January 1815 (news took several weeks to cross the Atlantic before the advent of steam ships). The Treaty of Ghent subsequently ended the war with no territorial changes.  It was the last war between Britain and the United States.<ref>Jeremy Black, ''The War of 1812 in the Age of Napoleon'' (2009)</ref>\n\n====George IV and William IV====\nBritain emerged from the Napoleonic Wars a very different country than it had been in 1793. As industrialisation progressed, society changed, becoming more urban and less rural. The postwar period saw an economic slump, and poor harvests and inflation caused widespread social unrest. Europe after 1815 was on guard against a return of Jacobinism, and even liberal Britain saw the passage of the Six Acts in 1819, which proscribed radical activities. By the end of the 1820s, along with a general economic recovery, many of these repressive laws were repealed  and in 1828 new legislation guaranteed the civil rights of religious dissenters.\n\nA weak ruler as regent (1811\u201320) and king (1820\u201330), George IV let his ministers take full charge of government affairs, playing a far lesser role than his father, George III. His governments, with little help from the king, presided over victory in the Napoleonic Wars, negotiated the peace settlement, and attempted to deal with the social and economic malaise that followed.<ref>Kenneth Baker, \"George IV: a Sketch,\" ''History Today'' 2005 55(10): 30\u201336.</ref> His brother [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]] ruled (1830\u201337), but was little involved in politics. His reign saw several reforms: the [[poor law]] was updated, [[child labour]] restricted, [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|slavery abolished]] in nearly all the [[British Empire]], and, most important, the [[Reform Act 1832]] refashioned the British electoral system.<ref>[[Brock, Michael]] (2004) \"William IV (1765\u20131837)\", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography,'' (2004) {{doi|10.1093/ref:odnb/29451}}</ref>\n\nThere were no major wars until the [[Crimean War]] (1853\u201356).<ref>Jeremy Black, ''A military history of Britain: from 1775 to the present'' (2008), pp. 74\u201377</ref> While Prussia, Austria, and Russia, as absolute monarchies, tried to suppress liberalism wherever it might occur, the British came to terms with new ideas. Britain intervened in Portugal in 1826 to defend a constitutional government there and recognising the independence of Spain's American colonies in 1824.<ref>William W. Kaufmann, ''British policy and the independence of Latin America, 1804\u20131828'' (1967)</ref> British merchants and financiers, and later railway builders, played major roles in the economies of most Latin American nations.<ref>Will Kaufman and Heidi Slettedahl Macpherson (eds).

[[Catholic emancipation]] was secured in the Catholic Relief Act of 1829, which removed the most substantial restrictions on Roman Catholics in Great Britain and Ireland.<ref name=\"L. Woodward, 1938 pp 325\u201330\">E. L. Woodward, ''The Age of Reform, 1815\u20131870'' (1938), pp. 325\u201330</ref>\n\nThe Whigs became champions of Parliamentary reform. They made [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Lord Grey]] prime minister 1830\u20131834, and the [[Reform Act 1832|Reform Act of 1832]] became their signature measure. It broadened the franchise and ended the system of \"rotten borough\" and \"pocket boroughs\" (where elections were controlled by powerful families), and instead redistributed power on the basis of population. It added 217,000 voters to an electorate of 435,000 in England and Wales. The main effect of the act was to weaken the power of the landed gentry, and enlarge the power of the professional and business middle-class, which now for the first time had a significant voice in Parliament. However, the great majority of manual workers, clerks, and farmers did not have enough property to qualify to vote. The aristocracy continued to dominate the government, the Army and Royal Navy, and high society.<ref name=\"L. Woodward, 1938 pp 325\u201330\"/> After parliamentary investigations demonstrated the horrors of child labour, limited reforms were passed in 1833.\n\n[[Chartism]] emerged after the 1832 Reform Bill failed to give the vote  to the working class. Activists denounced the \"betrayal\" of the working classes and the \"sacrificing\" of their \"interests\" by the \"misconduct\" of the government. In 1838, Chartists issued the People's Charter demanding manhood suffrage, equal sized election districts, voting by ballots, payment of Members of Parliament (so that poor men could serve), annual Parliaments, and abolition of property requirements. The [[ruling class]] saw the movement as pathological, {{Clarify|date=September 2013}} so the Chartists were unable to force serious constitutional debate. Historians see Chartism as both a continuation of the 18th century fight against corruption and as a new stage in demands for democracy in an industrial society.<ref>Malcolm Chase. ''Chartism: A New History'' (2007)</ref> In 1832 Parliament abolished slavery in the Empire with the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833]]. The government purchased the slaves for \u00a320,000,000 (the money went to rich plantation owners who mostly lived in England), and freed the slaves, especially those in the Caribbean sugar islands.<ref>E.

Scholars debate whether the Victorian period\u2014as defined by a variety of sensibilities and political concerns that have come to be associated with the Victorians\u2014actually begins with the passage of the [[Reform Act 1832]]. The era was preceded by the [[Regency era]] and succeeded by the [[Edwardian period]]. Victoria became queen in 1837 at age 18. Her long reign saw Britain reach the zenith of its economic and political power, with the introduction of steam ships, railroads, photography, and the telegraph. Britain again remained mostly inactive in Continental politics. {{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\n====Foreign policy====\n\n====Free trade imperialism====\nThe Great London Exhibition of 1851 clearly demonstrated Britain's dominance in engineering and industry; that lasted until the rise of the United States and Germany in the 1890s. Using the imperial tools of free trade and financial investment,<ref>Bernard Semmel, ''The Rise of Free Trade Imperialism'' (Cambridge University Press, 1970) ch 1</ref> it exerted major influence on many countries outside Europe, especially in [[Latin America]] and [[Asia]]. Thus Britain had both a formal Empire based on British rule as well as an informal one based on the British pound.<ref>David McLean. \"Finance and \"Informal Empire\" before the First World War\", [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2594316 ''Economic History Review'' (1976) 29#2 pp. 291\u2013305], at jstor.org</ref>\n\n====Russia, France and the Ottoman Empire====\nOne nagging fear was the possible collapse of the Ottoman Empire. It was well understood that a collapse of that country would set off a scramble for its territory and possibly plunge Britain into war. To head that off Britain sought to keep the Russians from occupying Constantinople and taking over the [[Bosporous Straits]], as well as from [[The Great Game|threatening India via Afghanistan]].<ref>Roman Golicz. \"The Russians Shall Not Have Constantinople\", ''History Today'' (2003) 53#9, pp. 39\u201345</ref> In 1853, Britain and France intervened in the [[Crimean War]] against Russia.

Prince Albert was effective in defusing a [[Trent Affair|war scare in late 1861]]. The British people, however, who depended heavily on American food imports, generally favoured the Union. What little cotton was available came from New York, as the blockade by the US Navy shut down 95% of Southern exports to Britain. In September 1862, [[Abraham Lincoln]] announced the [[Emancipation Proclamation]]. Since support of the Confederacy now meant supporting the institution of slavery, there was no possibility of European intervention.<ref>Amanda Foreman. ''A World on Fire: Britain's Crucial Role in the American Civil War'' (2012)<!-- ISBN needed --></ref> The British sold arms to both sides, built blockade runners for a lucrative trade with the Confederacy, and surreptitiously allowed warships to be built for the Confederacy. The warships caused a major diplomatic row that was resolved in the [[Alabama Claims]] in 1872, in the Americans' favour.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Frank J. Merli|author2=David M.

Several of the colonies temporarily refused to join the Dominion despite pressure from both Canada and Britain; the last one, [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]], held out until 1949. The second half of the 19th century saw a [[scramble for Africa|huge expansion]] of Britain's colonial empire, mostly in [[Africa]]. A talk of the Union Jack flying \"from Cairo to Cape Town\" only became a reality at the end of the [[World War I|Great War]]. Having possessions on six continents, Britain had to defend all of its empire and did so with a volunteer army, the only [[great power]] in Europe to have no conscription. Some questioned whether the country was overstretched.\n\nThe rise of the [[German Empire]] since its creation in 1871 posed a new challenge, for it (along with the United States), threatened to usurp Britain's place as the world's foremost industrial power. Germany acquired a number of colonies in Africa and the Pacific, but Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] succeeded in achieving general peace through his balance of power strategy. When [[William II, German Emperor|William II]] became emperor in 1888, he discarded Bismarck, began using bellicose language, and planned to build a navy to rival Britain's.<ref>A. J. P. Taylor. ''The Struggle for Mastery in Europe: 1848\u20131918'' (1953), Chapter 12{{ISBN missing}}</ref>\n\nEver since Britain had wrested control of the [[Cape Colony]] from the Netherlands during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], it had co-existed with Dutch settlers who had migrated further away from the Cape and created two republics of their own. The British imperial vision called for control over these new countries, and the Dutch-speaking \"Boers\" (or \"Afrikaners\") fought back in the [[Second Boer War|War in 1899\u20131902]]. Outgunned by a mighty empire, the Boers waged a guerrilla war (which certain other British territories would later employ to attain independence). This gave the British regulars a difficult fight, but their weight of numbers, superior equipment, and often brutal tactics, eventually brought about a British victory. The war had been costly in human rights and was widely criticised by Liberals in Britain and worldwide. However, the United States gave its support. The Boer republics were merged into the [[Union of South Africa]] in 1910; this had internal self-government, but its foreign policy was controlled by London and it was an integral part of the British Empire.<ref>Denis Judd.

However King [[George III of England|George III]] blocked emancipation, arguing that to grant it would break his [[coronation oath]] to defend the [[Anglican Communion|Anglican Church]]. A campaign by the lawyer [[Daniel O'Connell]], and the death of George III, led to the concession of Catholic Emancipation in 1829, allowing Roman Catholics to sit in the Parliament of the United Kingdom. But Catholic Emancipation was not O'Connell's ultimate goal, which was Repeal of the Act of Union with Great Britain. On 1 January 1843 O'Connell confidently, but wrongly, declared that Repeal would be achieved that year. When [[potato blight]] hit the island in 1846, much of the rural population was left without food, because [[cash crop]]s were being exported to pay rents.<ref>Christine Kinealy.

''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845\u20131849'' (1962), London, Hamish Hamilton: 31</ref>\n\nBritish politicians such as the [[Prime Minister]] [[Robert Peel]] were at this time wedded to the [[economic policy]] of [[laissez-faire]],  which argued against state intervention. While funds were raised by private individuals and charities, lack of adequate action let the problem become a catastrophe. Cottiers (or farm labourers) were largely wiped out during what is known in Ireland as the \"[[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Hunger]]\". A significant minority elected [[Unionism in Ireland|Unionists]], who championed the Union. A [[Church of Ireland]] former [[Tory]] barrister turned nationalist campaigner, [[Isaac Butt]], established a new moderate nationalist movement, the [[Home Rule League]], in the 1870s. After Butt's death the Home Rule Movement, or the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] as it had become known, was turned into a major political force under the guidance of [[William Shaw (Irish politician)|William Shaw]] and a radical young Protestant landowner, [[Charles Stewart Parnell]]. {{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nParnell's movement campaigned for \"Home Rule\", by which they meant that Ireland would govern itself as a region within the United Kingdom. Two Home Rule Bills (1886 and 1893) were introduced by Liberal Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]], but neither became law, mainly due to opposition from the Conservative Party and the [[House of Lords]]. The issue was a source of contention throughout Ireland, as a significant majority of [[Unionism in Ireland|Unionists]] (largely but not exclusively based in [[Ulster]]), opposed Home Rule, fearing that a [[Rome Rule|Catholic Nationalist]] (\"Rome Rule\") Parliament in Dublin would discriminate or retaliate against them, impose Roman Catholic doctrine, and impose tariffs on industry. While most of Ireland was primarily agricultural, six of the counties in Ulster were the location of heavy industry and would be affected by any tariff barriers imposed. {{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\n==20th century to present==\n{{main|History of the United Kingdom|History of the Republic of Ireland}}\n\n===1900\u20131945===\nAt the turn of the century, Britain was involved in the [[Second Boer War]] in [[South Africa]].\n\n[[Queen Victoria]], who had reigned since 1837, died in 1901 and was succeeded by her son, [[Edward VII]], who, in turn, was succeeded by [[George V]] in 1910.\n\nIn 1914, Britain entered the [[World War I|First World War]] by declaring war on [[German Empire|Germany]]. Nearly a million Britons were killed in the war, which lasted until Germany's surrender on 11 November 1918.\n\nHome Rule in Ireland, which had been a major political issue since the late 19th century but put on hold by the war, was somewhat resolved after the [[Irish War of Independence]] brought the British Government to a stalemate in 1922. Negotiations led to the formation of the [[Irish Free State]]. However, in order to appease Unionists in the north, the north-eastern six counties remained as part of the U.K., forming Northern Ireland with its own Parliament at Stormont in Belfast.\n\nHaving been in power for much of the early 20th century under Prime Ministers [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman|Campbell-Bannerman]], [[H. H. Asquith|Asquith]] and [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]], the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal party]] suffered a sharp decline from 1922; the newly formed [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour party]], whose leader [[Ramsay MacDonald]] led two minority governments, swiftly became the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]]' main opposition, and Britain's largest party of the left.\n\nKing [[Edward VIII]] succeeded his father George V in January 1936, but was quickly met with difficulties due to his love affair with [[Wallis Simpson]], an American who had already been married twice. In December, he decided to abdicate in order to be able to marry Simpson, and his brother [[George VI]] was crowned king.\n\nIn order to avoid another European conflict, Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]] attempted to appease German Chancellor [[Adolf Hitler]], who was expanding his country's territory across Central Europe. Despite proclaiming that he has achieved \"peace for our time\", Britain declared war on Germany on 3 September 1939, following Hitler's invasion of Poland two days earlier. The U.K. thus joined the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] in opposition to the Axis forces of [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]]. For the first time, civilians were not exempt from the war, as London suffered nightly bombings during [[the Blitz]].

Attlee created a [[Welfare State]] in Britain, which most notably provided free healthcare under the [[National Health Service]]. By the late 1940s, the [[Cold War]] was underway, which would dominate British foreign policy for another 40 years.\n\nIn 1951, Churchill and the Tories returned to power; they would govern uninterrupted for the next 13 years. King [[George VI]] died in 1952, and was succeeded by his eldest daughter, [[Elizabeth II]].\n\nChurchill was succeeded in 1955 by [[Sir Anthony Eden]], whose premiership was dominated by the [[Suez Crisis]], in which Britain, France and Israel plotted to bomb Egypt after its President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]] nationalised the [[Suez Canal]]. Eden's successor, Harold Macmillan, split the Conservatives when Britain applied to join the [[European Economic Community]], but French President [[Charles de Gaulle]] vetoed the application.\n\nLabour returned to power in 1964 under [[Harold Wilson]], who brought in a number of social reforms, including the legalisation of abortion, the abolition of capital punishment and the decriminalisation of homosexuality. In 1973, Conservative Prime Minister Edward Heath succeeded in securing U.K. membership in the European Economic Community (EEC), what would later become known as the European Union. Wilson, having lost the 1970 election to Heath, returned to power in 1974; however, Labour's reputation was harmed by the [[winter of discontent]] of 1978-9 under Jim Callaghan, which enabled the Conservatives to re-take control of Parliament in 1979, under [[Margaret Thatcher]], Britain's first female Prime Minister.\n\nAlthough Thatcher's economic reforms made her initially unpopular, her decision in 1982 to retake the [[Falkland Islands]] from invading [[Argentine]] forces, in what would become known as the [[Falklands War]], changed her fortunes and enabled a [[landslide victory]] in 1983. After winning an unprecedented third election in 1987, however, Thatcher's popularity began to fade and she was replaced by former chancellor [[John Major]] in 1990.\n\nTensions between Protestants and Catholics in Northern Ireland came to a head in the late 1960s, when nationalist participants in a civil rights march were shot by members of the [[B Specials]], a reserve police force manned almost exclusively by unionists. From this point the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]], also known as the Provos or simply the IRA, began a bombing campaign throughout the U.K., beginning a period known as [[The Troubles]], which lasted until the late 1990s.\n\n[[Prince Charles]], the Prince of Wales and Elizabeth's eldest son married [[Lady Diana Spencer]] in 1981; the couple had two children, William and Harry, but divorced in 1992, during which year Prince Andrew and Princess Anne also separated from their spouses, leading the Queen to call the year her '[[annus horribilis]]'. In 1997, Diana was killed in a car crash in Paris, leading to a mass outpouring of grief across the United Kingdom, and indeed the world.\n\nOn the international stage, the second half of the 20th century was dominated by the [[Cold War]] between the Soviet Union and its socialist allies and the United States and its capitalist allies; the U.K. was a key supporter of the latter, joining the anti-Soviet military alliance [[NATO]] in 1949. During this period, the U.K. became involved in several Cold War conflicts, such as the [[Korean War]] (1950\u20131953). In contrast, the Republic of Ireland remained neutral and provided troops to U.N. peace-keeping missions.\n\n===1997\u2013present===\nIn 1997, [[Tony Blair]] was elected prime minister in a landslide victory for the so-called '[[New Labour]]', economically following '[[Third Way (centrism)|Third Way]]' programmes. Blair won re-election in 2001 and 2005, before handing over power to his chancellor [[Gordon Brown]] in 2007. After a decade of prosperity both the U.K. and the Irish Republic were affected by the global recession, which began in 2008. In 2010, the Conservative party formed a coalition government with the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], with Tory leader [[David Cameron]] as Prime Minister. In 2015 polling suggested a [[hung parliament]] was the most likely outcome in the General Election; however the Conservatives secured a slim majority.\n\nAfter the [[September 11 Attacks]], the U.K. supported the U.S. in their \"[[War on Terror]]\", and joined them in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)]] and the [[Iraq War|invasion of Iraq]]. London was attacked in [[7 July 2005 London bombings|July 2005]]. The U.K. also took a leading role in the [[2011 military intervention in Libya]]. In a [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|referendum in 2016]], the U.K. voted to leave the [[European Union]].\n\nAfter becoming Prime Minister and leader of the Conservative Party shortly after David Cameron's resignation following the Brexit result, an [[2017 United Kingdom general election|election]] was called by the incumbent Prime Minister [[Theresa May]] (the former Home Secretary), in an attempt to gain a larger majority for Brexit negotiations and also as an advantage, as the Labour Party were doing badly in the [[Opinion polling for the United Kingdom general election, 2017|polls]], the Conservative Party lost their majority despite winning a record number of votes, and were restricted to forming a \"supply and confidence\" deal, yet not a formal coalition with the Northern Irish unionist party, the [[Democratic Unionist Party|DUP]] in order to have a working majority in the House of Commons.\n\n==Periods==\n{{See also|History of Ireland}}\n\n* [[Prehistoric Britain]] (Prehistory\u2013AD 43)\n** [[Prehistoric Scotland]]\n** [[Prehistoric Wales]]\n* [[Roman Britain]] (44\u2013407)\n* [[Sub-Roman Britain]] (407\u2013597)\n* [[Great Britain in the Middle Ages|Britain in the Middle Ages]] (597\u20131485)\n** [[Anglo-Saxon England]] (597\u20131066)\n** [[Scotland in the Early Middle Ages]] (400\u2013900)\n** [[Scotland in the High Middle Ages]] (900\u20131286)\n** [[Norman Conquest of England]] (1066)\n** [[Scotland in the Late Middle Ages]] (1286\u20131513)\n*** [[Wars of Scottish Independence]] (1296\u20131357)\n** [[Wales in the Middle Ages]] (411-1542)\n* [[Early modern Britain]]\n** [[Tudor period]] (1485\u20131603)\n***[[Tudor conquest of Ireland]]\n*** [[English Renaissance]]\n*** [[Elizabethan era]] (1558\u20131603)\n** [[First British Empire]] (1583\u20131783)\n** [[Jacobean era]] (1567\u20131625)\n** [[Union of the Crowns]] (1603)\n** [[Caroline era]] (1625\u20131642)\n** [[English Civil War]] (1642\u20131651)\n** [[English Interregnum]] (1651\u20131660)\n** [[English Restoration|Restoration]] (1660)\n** [[Glorious Revolution]] (1688)\n** [[Scottish Enlightenment]]\n** [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] (1707\u20131800)\n** [[Second British Empire]] (1783\u20131815)\n** [[Georgian era]]\n* [[History of the United Kingdom]] (1801\u2013)\n**[[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] (1801\u20131922)\n*** [[Britain's Imperial Century]] (1815\u20131914)\n*** [[British Regency|Regency]] (1811\u20131820)\n*** [[Victorian era]] (1837\u20131901)\n*** [[Edwardian period]] (1901\u20131910)\n*** [[Britain in World War I]] (1914\u20131918)\n*** [[Coalition Government 1916\u20131922]]\n**[[United Kingdom]] of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (1922\u2013)\n***[[Conservative Government 1922\u20131924]]\n***[[Conservative Government 1924\u20131929]]\n***[[Labour Government 1929\u20131931]]\n***[[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]] (1931\u20131940)\n***[[Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II|Britain in World War II]] (1939\u20131945)\n***[[History of the United Kingdom (1945\u2013present)]]\n***[[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher]] (1979\u20131990)\n***[[Premiership of Tony Blair]] (1997\u20132007)\n***[[Premiership of Gordon Brown]] (2007\u20132010)\n***[[Premiership of David Cameron]] (2010\u20132016)\n***[[Premiership of Theresa May]] (2016\u20132019)\n***[[Premiership of Boris Johnson]] (2019\u2013)\n*[[History of the Republic of Ireland]] (1922\u2013)\n**[[Irish civil war]]\n\n==Timeline history of the British Isles==\n{{Timeline history of the British Isles}}\n\n==Geographic==\n* [[History of England]] ([[Timeline of English history|Timeline]])\n** [[History of Cornwall]]\n** [[History of London]]\n* [[History of Scotland]]\n* [[History of Wales]]\n* [[History of Ireland]]\n** [[History of Northern Ireland]]\n** [[History of the Republic of Ireland]] ([[Timeline of Irish history|Timeline]])\n* [[History of the Isle of Man]]\n* [[History of Jersey]]\n\n===States===\n* [[England in the Middle Ages]]\n* [[Kingdom of England]] (to 1707)\n* [[Kingdom of Scotland]] (to 1707)\n* [[Kingdom of Ireland]] (1541\u20131801)\n* [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] (1707\u20131801)\n* [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] (1801\u20131927)\n* [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]] (1927 \u2013 )\n* [[Isle of Man]] (unrecorded date to present)\n\n===Supranational===\n* [[British Empire]]\n* [[Commonwealth of Nations]]\n* [[European Union]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[Timeline of the British Army]]\n* [[Timeline of British diplomatic history]]\n* [[British military history]]\n*[[List of British monarchs]]\n**[[British monarchs' family tree]]\n* [[Economic history of the United Kingdom]]\n* [[History of British society]]\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*<cite>[[A History of Britain (book)|A History of Britain]]: At the Edge of the World, 3500 BC -

In 1329, the manor of Widford was held by [[Edward of Woodstock]], Earl of Kent; and it afterwards passed to the Mortimer, Bacon, Altham, and other families.\n\n===Account of Widford in 1848===\n''White\u2019s Directory of Essex'', published in 1848, describes Widford as \u2018a small parish on the London road\u2019 (the old Roman road which has become the A414, Widford Road & Moulsham Street). It contained {{convert|692|acre}} of land, and about 190 inhabitants. When the census was taken in July 1841, its population had been swelled by railway labourers to 362. Widford village had about 300 occupants, but appeared to have been split so that some of it was in Chelmsford parish.\n\nJohn Attwood MP owned most of the land and lord of the manor. The description from 1848 goes on to say that he \u2018has a handsome seat here, called Hylands on the western acclivity of the valley, commanding extensive views. Though the house was large and handsome, he is now erecting a more elegant and spacious mansion. The park and pleasure grounds are extensive and beautiful. The old house was erected by Chief Justice [[John Comyns]], Kt, in about 1730, and was much improved by the late P. C. Labouchere, Esq. Mr. Attwood is one of the parliamentary representatives of Harwich.\u2019\n\nThe description of the village goes on \u2018the Church (St. Mary) is a small neat structure of mixed architecture, but evidently of Saxon origin. The wooden turret, at the west end, has two bells, and is crowned by a small spire. There is a chapel belonging to the lord of the manor, and near it is a monument in memory of Viscountess Falkland. The rectory, valued in K.B. at \u00a38, and in 1831, at \u00a3225, is in the patronage of J Attwood and incumbency of the Rev William Buswell BA, who has a good residence, which he has lately much improved. The tithes were commuted in 1838, for \u00a3257 per annum. Mr. Attwood built a Schoolhouse in the church yard in 1843. In 1776, Lady Falkland left \u00a3200 to this parish, to provide for a weekly contribution of bread among the pool attending the church. To increase this charity, the Rev John Saunders left \u00a3100 in 1814. These bequests now form a fund of \u00a3379.4s.9d. three per cent Consols, and the dividends are applied in a weekly distribution of 17 threepenny loaves. In 1738, Benjamin Sarjant left \u00a3100 three per cent. Reduced Annuities, in trust, to apply the dividends yearly in clothing, for two poor widows, and two poor widowers.\u2019\n\n===Notable buildings===\nThe 1881 map of the area <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.old-maps.co.uk/|title=Old-Maps - the online repository of historic maps - home page|website=www.old-maps.co.uk}}</ref> appears to show five buildings of significance: Hylands House, Widford Hall, Widford Lodge, St Mary\u2019s church and the workhouse.\n\n*[[Hylands Park]] and House is now in the ownership of [[Borough of Chelmsford|Chelmsford City Council]] and its history is well documented.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://friendsofhylandshouse.com/history/history.htm|title=The Friends of Hylands House: History of the House|last=|first=|date=|website=Friends of Hylands House|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131009060101/http://friendsofhylandshouse.com/history/history.htm|archive-date=9 October 2013|access-date=14 April 2020}}</ref>  It is no longer in the parish of Widford.\n*Widford Hall still exists.

She dropped the name Ann after her younger sister, Ann Todd (Clark), was born, and did not use the name Todd after marrying.\n\nMary was a member of a large, wealthy Kentucky family, and was well educated. After finishing school during her teens, she moved to [[Springfield, Illinois]], where she lived with her married sister Elizabeth Edwards. Before she married Abraham Lincoln, Mary was courted by his long-time political opponent [[Stephen A. Douglas]]. She and Lincoln had four sons together, three of whom died in childhood. Their home of about 17 years still stands at Eighth and Jackson Streets in Springfield, Illinois.\n\nShe staunchly supported her husband throughout his presidency, and was active in keeping national morale high during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. She acted as the White House social coordinator, throwing lavish balls and redecorating the White House at great expense; her spending was the source of much consternation. She was seated next to Abraham when he was [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|assassinated]] in the President's Box at [[Ford's Theatre]] on Tenth Street in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]. His death weighed heavily on her, as did the death of her sons.\n\nMary suffered from numerous physical and mental health issues during her life. She had frequent [[Migraine|migraines]], which were exacerbated by a head injury in the 1860s. She was [[Depression (mood)|depressed]] for much of her life; some historians think she may have had [[bipolar disorder]]. She was briefly [[Involuntary commitment|institutionalized]] for psychiatric disease in 1875 but later retired to the home of her sister. She died of a stroke in 1882. Of her husband and four children, only the eldest son, [[Robert Todd Lincoln]], outlived Mary.\n\n==Early life and education==\nMary was born in [[Lexington, Kentucky]], as the fourth of seven children of [[Robert Smith Todd]], a banker, and Elizabeth \"Eliza\" (Parker) Todd.<ref name=\"EmersonJason\"/> Her family were slaveholders, and Mary was raised in comfort and refinement.<ref>Catherine Clinton, ''Mrs. Lincoln: A Life'' (New York: HarperCollins, 2010) {{ISBN|0-06-076041-9}}</ref> When Mary was six, her mother died in [[childbirth]].

She dropped the name Ann after her younger sister, Ann Todd (Clark), was born, and did not use the name Todd after marrying.\n\nMary was a member of a large, wealthy Kentucky family, and was well educated. After finishing school during her teens, she moved to [[Springfield, Illinois]], where she lived with her married sister Elizabeth Edwards. Before she married Abraham Lincoln, Mary was courted by his long-time political opponent [[Stephen A. Douglas]]. She and Lincoln had four sons together, three of whom died in childhood. Their home of about 17 years still stands at Eighth and Jackson Streets in Springfield, Illinois.\n\nShe staunchly supported her husband throughout his presidency, and was active in keeping national morale high during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. She acted as the White House social coordinator, throwing lavish balls and redecorating the White House at great expense; her spending was the source of much consternation. She was seated next to Abraham when he was [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|assassinated]] in the President's Box at [[Ford's Theatre]] on Tenth Street in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]. His death weighed heavily on her, as did the death of her sons.\n\nMary suffered from numerous physical and mental health issues during her life. She had frequent [[Migraine|migraines]], which were exacerbated by a head injury in the 1860s. She was [[Depression (mood)|depressed]] for much of her life; some historians think she may have had [[bipolar disorder]]. She was briefly [[Involuntary commitment|institutionalized]] for psychiatric disease in 1875 but later retired to the home of her sister. She died of a stroke in 1882.

Short was born June 22, 1903 in [[Le Mars, Iowa]] to Hugh Connoran and Anne Otely Corkery Short. Less than a year later the family moved to North Dakota and what would become the Short Ranch. The ranch is located in [[Billings County, North Dakota]]; near the town of [[Medora, North Dakota|Medora]] where Short attended public schools. He also attended the St. James School in Faribault, Minnesota, and an agricultural short course at Montana State University at Bozeman. Short graduated from [[Pillsbury Baptist Bible College|Pillsbury Military Academy]], [[Owatonna, Minnesota]], in 1921; and was a student at the [[University of Minnesota]] 1922-1926, where he joined [[Phi Kappa Psi]]. After attending college he returned to the Short Ranch. In 1929 he married Edith Esther Whittemore, a Medora school teacher. He made his living as a cattle rancher and farmer.\n\nDon and Edith ran the ranch with their son Con Short (Buzzie) until the former congressman's health failed in his late 70s. He developed Alzheimer's in his last few years and became more and more uncomfortable outside of Beach, ND. He was a long-time resident of Beach.  He greatly enjoyed driving back and forth from Beach to the ranch in his later years to check on cattle and crops, until his death in Dickinson, N.D., on May 10, 1982. He was interred in the scenic Medora Cemetery, Medora. His gravestone is inscribed COWBOY, and sits on the top of a bluff overlooking town of Medora, next to the Medora Musical outdoor theater.\n\nWhile in Washington, D.C. he became friends with George H. W. Bush and Richard Nixon in his time in the House of Representatives {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}. He was remembered by ND political writer Darrell Dorgan, brother of Senator Byron Dorgan (D, ND) as one of the last true statesmen after his death in 1982{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}.\n\n===Politics===\nShort began his career in politics as a County Supervisor for the Farm Security Administration from 1937 to 1938. In 1957 he became a member of the [[North Dakota House of Representatives]]. As a Republican candidate in 1958 he was elected as a member of the United States House of Representatives. He took office January 3, 1959 representing Dakota's 1st congressional district. He was a member of the [[86th United States Congress|Eighty-sixth]], [[87th United States Congress|Eighty-seventh]], and [[88th United States Congress|Eighty-eighth]] Congresses. He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1964 to the [[89th United States Congress|Eighty-ninth]] Congress. His defeat was attributed to the efforts of Senator Milton Young (a ND Republican Senator. Young actively and covertly worked to have Short defeated even refusing to endorse Short as he had eagerly had given his support in previous elections. Two years later, Short was asked to run for Congress again, but declined as he had moved back to tend to the ranch.\n\nThe nature of Don Short's and Milt Young's dispute was money versus stewardship. Milt Young and Don Short disagreed about the need for a highway through an unspoiled piece of America's scenic national treasure, The Badlands. Short voted against building a US highway through the National Grasslands. Young disagreed with him. Short's efforts won in the long run as no US highway was ever built and the land remains unspoiled and pristine.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Biography}}\n* {{Find a Grave|6602331}}\n* {{CongBio|S000378}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-par|us-hs}}\n{{US House succession box\n| state=North Dakota\n| district=AL\n| before=[[Otto Krueger (politician)|Otto Krueger]]\n| after=None; seat abolished\n| years=1959\u20131963}}\n{{US House succession box\n| state=North Dakota\n| district=2\n| before=New district\n| after=[[Rolland W.

His gravestone is inscribed COWBOY, and sits on the top of a bluff overlooking town of Medora, next to the Medora Musical outdoor theater.\n\nWhile in Washington, D.C. he became friends with George H. W. Bush and Richard Nixon in his time in the House of Representatives {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}. He was remembered by ND political writer Darrell Dorgan, brother of Senator Byron Dorgan (D, ND) as one of the last true statesmen after his death in 1982{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}.\n\n===Politics===\nShort began his career in politics as a County Supervisor for the Farm Security Administration from 1937 to 1938. In 1957 he became a member of the [[North Dakota House of Representatives]]. As a Republican candidate in 1958 he was elected as a member of the United States House of Representatives. He took office January 3, 1959 representing Dakota's 1st congressional district. He was a member of the [[86th United States Congress|Eighty-sixth]], [[87th United States Congress|Eighty-seventh]], and [[88th United States Congress|Eighty-eighth]] Congresses. He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1964 to the [[89th United States Congress|Eighty-ninth]] Congress. His defeat was attributed to the efforts of Senator Milton Young (a ND Republican Senator. Young actively and covertly worked to have Short defeated even refusing to endorse Short as he had eagerly had given his support in previous elections. Two years later, Short was asked to run for Congress again, but declined as he had moved back to tend to the ranch.\n\nThe nature of Don Short's and Milt Young's dispute was money versus stewardship. Milt Young and Don Short disagreed about the need for a highway through an unspoiled piece of America's scenic national treasure, The Badlands. Short voted against building a US highway through the National Grasslands. Young disagreed with him. Short's efforts won in the long run as no US highway was ever built and the land remains unspoiled and pristine.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Biography}}\n* {{Find a Grave|6602331}}\n* {{CongBio|S000378}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-par|us-hs}}\n{{US House succession box\n| state=North Dakota\n| district=AL\n| before=[[Otto Krueger (politician)|Otto Krueger]]\n| after=None; seat abolished\n| years=1959\u20131963}}\n{{US House succession box\n| state=North Dakota\n| district=2\n| before=New district\n| after=[[Rolland W.
