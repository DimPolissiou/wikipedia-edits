Hein had successfully unmasked [[Jan Versteegh]] as the Mole of 2018, outwitting his fellow finalist, [[Olcay Gulsen|Olcay G\u00fcl\u015fen]].\n\n==Format==\nFollowed the same format as its [[De Mol (TV series)|Belgian predecessor]], the season had ten Dutch celebrities travel to [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] to complete Assignments to earn money for the group pot. However, one of the ten is the titular Mole (de Mol), the one designated to sabotage the assignments and cause the group to earn the least amount of money for the winner's pot as possible. Every few days, players would take a 20-question [[multiple choice]] test about the identity of the Mole. Once the test is complete, the candidates await their results in an Execution ceremony. The candidate with the worst score is executed from the game, while in the event of the tie the candidate who completed their test the slowest is executed. The season plays out until there are three remaining candidates, where they must complete a final test (consisting of 40 questions). The candidate with the highest score, or had completed their test the fastest in a tie, is declared the winner and receives the group's pot.<ref>{{cite web |title=Info - Wie is de Mol? |url=https://wieisdemol.avrotros.nl/info/ |website=Wie is de Mol |publisher=AVROTROS |accessdate=23 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe season began with the candidates unknowingly scattered in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine for the first assignment to discover where the host country of the season will be, Georgia. This season also had a candidate quit in the season for the upkeep of their mental health; a series' first compared to previous medical evacuations and withdrawals. The season also changed the unmasking of the Mole. Where after the final test had been written, the finalists were informed that they would find out who the Mole is along with the rest of the Netherlands at the Live Finale. Typically the finalists would be informed of the Mole immediately after the final test and the secret would remain until the unmasking during the Live Finale broadcast.\n\n==Candidates==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\n!Name\n!Day Exited\n!Result\n|-\n|[[Jan Versteegh]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 18\n|style=background:lightgray;|'''The Mole'''\n|-\n|{{ill|Ruben Hein|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 18\n|'''Winner'''\n|-\n|[[Olcay Gulsen|Olcay G\u00fcl\u015fen]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 18\n|Runner-Up\n|-\n|{{ill|Simone Weimans|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 15\n|3rd place\n|-\n|{{ill|Stine Jensen|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 13\n|4th place\n|-\n|[[Loes Haverkort]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 9\n|5th place\n|-\n|{{ill|Emilio Guzman|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 7\n|6th place\n|-\n|{{ill|Bella Hay|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 5\n|7th place\n|-\n|[[Jean-Marc van Tol]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 3\n|Quit\n|-\n|{{ill|Ron Boszhard|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 1\n|8th place\n|}\n\n==Candidates Progress==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" border=\"2\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:96%\"\n!

The Underground candidate's phone could only receive signal at a small opening far from the instructions board in the maze. With a phone in hand, the Searchers have 45 minutes to find the Underground candidates to earn \u20ac1,500 for the pot.\n\nThe candidates failed the assignment, and nothing was earned for the pot.\n\n'''Niets is Wat Het Lijkt (Nothing is What It Seems)'''\nThe day of the assignment was Georgia's independence day from the Soviet Union. The candidates were taken to the 9 April Park, for a private interrogation with Art. Between Art and the candidate stood a table with a series of flowchart questions. Before Art begins the interrogation, he informs each of the candidates that they could earn an Exemption for the Finale if they do well in this assignment. The interrogation begins with Art asking if the candidates want to know who the Mole already, with the candidate having to answer yes or no. They proceed through the flowchart answering Art's questions about their personal tactics and potential dilemmas until they reach the bottom of the table, with a final question between \u20ac5,000 for the pot, or a group exemption.\n\nAt the end of the assignment, Art informed the candidates that if they had paid enough attention, they would have noticed that they were visited by the Mole during their interrogations in the park. Essentially being the exemption to the Finale that Art mentioned at the beginning of the assignment.\n\n'''Rode Draad (Red Wire) - Max. \u20ac5,000.-'''\nThe candidates were taken to the old Soviet District in Tbilisi, a lower-class district with Soviet era accommodations. On top of one of these buildings, the candidates had to zipline between two buildings. With the questions from yesterday noted by Art, the candidates had a choice of earning \u20ac5,000 or a group exemption in this assignment. The choice that the majority had chosen would be inside one of the envelopes Art gives the candidates. The objective of the assignment was for the candidates to transport envelopes across the zipline, earning whatever they managed to bring to Art. Each candidate were allowed to take only one out of the seven envelopes while they ziplined. Ruben panicked and refused to do the zipline, which led to Stine also deciding to not complete the assignment.\n\nOnly five of the candidates completed the zipline, with Art informing the candidates afterwards that they had been competing for \u20ac5,000. After opening all the envelopes, the candidates had successfully brought the \u20ac5,000 envelope to Art, and was added to the pot.\n\n===Episode 5 - Zienswijzen===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; margin: 10px\" align=\"right\" width=\"40%\"\n|-\n!colspan=3|Episode 5 - Zienswijzen\n|-\n!colspan=3|Original airdates: 03/02/2018<br>Locations: [[Tbilisi|Tbilisi, Georgia]] \n|-\n!

Each candidate to succeed in building their house of cards earns \u20ac250 for the pot. As the assignment went began, a circus procession entered the ring to distract the candidates, with Art announcing more tasks to earn money throughout.\n\nNone of the candidates built their house of cards, but \u20ac1,640.- was earned for the pot regardless.\n\n'''Chaos - Max. \u20ac2,000.-'''\nThe Treasurer was separated from the group, and informed of the assignment. The rest of the group would race around Tbilisi seeking checkpoints. At every checkpoint were cars to take them to another part of the city, however, the last candidate to arrive at each checkpoint would be eliminated from the assignment. It was the Treasurer's job to assign different rewards to each candidate, and whoever won the race, their reward would be the prize for the assignment.\n\nThe rewards were: One Joker, two jokers, \u20ac500, \u20ac1,000, and one candidate received nothing.\n\nLoes won the race, and at the finish, Art announced that the money she earned would be doubled.\n\n\u20ac1,000.- was earned for the pot.\n\n'''Woordzoekers (Wordsearchers) - Max. \u20ac1,000.-'''\nStanding in an empty warehouse, the candidates were shown a giant Wordsearch puzzle painted on the floor.

The candidates had 15 minutes to present a sentence using the remaining words to Art at the end of the Assignment.\n\nThe candidates did not present the correct sentence, and nothing was added to the pot.\n\n===Episode 6 - Verlost===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; margin: 10px\" align=\"right\" width=\"40%\"\n|-\n!colspan=3|Episode 6 - Verlost\n|-\n!colspan=3|Original airdates: 10/02/2018<br>Locations: [[Tbilisi|Tbilisi, Georgia]] \u2192 [[Tsqaltubo|Tskaltubo, Georgia]]\n|-\n!

The candidates are locked in rooms with keys to other rooms each, except for the Treasurer, who starts the assignment free to move around the Hotel from the beginning. The candidates had 15 minutes to free themselves and search the rooms for the money.\n\n\u20ac500.- was earned for the pot.\n\n'''Ladas met Lading (Ladas with Luggage) - Max. \u20ac1,500.-'''\nDivided between three houses in the village of Sukchai, Art instructed the candidates to help the families living in these houses pack their furniture into three Ladas, within 30 minutes. The next part of the assignment had the candidates try to add more furniture into their Ladas to add \u20ac50 per item for the pot, with 15 minutes to repack. The owner of the furniture was \u20ac250 for the pot. Once the repack was done, the candidates had to drive the Ladas to the new houses. Everything that was included in the repack and arrived at their new homes added money for the pot.\n\n\u20ac1,250.- was earned for the pot.\n\n'''Groen/Rood (Green/Red) - Max. \u20ac1,500.-'''\nAt the Execution, the candidates were given an opportunity to prevent their results from being shown. At the Medea Sanatorium, stood two identical boards with eight rotatable screens. Five screens had the candidates' names on them, and three had \u20ac500 on them. To prevent a candidate from seeing their screen, and earning money for the pot, both boards had to have matching green screens showing. Art presents a series of questions to the candidates, if they are correct, the candidate can turn a red screen green, or opt out from turning a green screen red. The candidates were divided into two teams: three designated to the red board, two assigned the green board.\n\nThe candidates chose to prevent their results from being shown, except for Simone. Nothing was added to the pot. Simone saw a Green screen for her results, even with a Black Exemption nullifying her Jokers, and everyone proceeded to the next episode.\n\n===Episode 7 - Schijn Werper===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; margin: 10px\" align=\"right\" width=\"40%\"\n|-\n!colspan=3|Episode 7 - Schijn Werper\n|-\n!colspan=3|Original airdates: 17/02/2018<br>Locations: [[Tsqaltubo|Tskaltubo, Georgia]] \u2192 [[Kutaisi|Kutaisi, Georgia]] \u2192 [[Borjomi|Borjomi, Georgia]]\n|-\n!

The candidates have a total of 21 minutes to complete the tasks. Each completed task added \u20ac250.- to the pot, with an additional \u20ac380.- if the candidates got a specific task correct.\n\n\u20ac750.- was earned for the pot.\n\n'''Praten als Brugman (Talk like a Bridgekeeper) - Max. \u20ac1,250.-'''\nArriving in the town of Kutaisi, the candidates had three hours to paint an important restored bridge for the town before the mayor officiates the grand re-opening.

Two longer, diverting routes would lead the finalists to \u20ac2,500.- that they could add to the pot, or to see the Mole at the end of the longest route. However, their time for the test starts as soon as they enter the castle, so the diversions cost time on their final test.\n\nThe final amount earned for the winner's pot would be revealed during the Live Finale, where for the first time in the series' history would include the unmasking of the Mole in front of the live audience, 167 days after the final day of filming.\n\n===Episode 10 - Finale===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; margin: 10px\" align=\"right\" width=\"40%\"\n|-\n!colspan=3|Episode 10 - Finale\n|-\n!colspan=3|Original airdates: 10/03/2018<br>Locations: [[Amsterdam|Amsterdam, Netherlands]] \n|-\n!

Jan, Ruben, and Olcay arrived at Vondelpark for a final debriefing by Art. At first, Art revealed that Olcay was not the Mole nor the winner, before Jan Versteegh finally stepped forward to reveal himself as the Mole. During the reunion after the unmasking, the executed candidates revealed that it was Olcay who misled them into thinking Ruben was the Mole. Meanwhile, Ruben only started to catch onto Jan as the Mole when Loes and Stine, his two main suspects were executed one after the other. In the Final Test, Olcay answered her test thinking Ruben was the Mole, and ultimately had no chance in beating Ruben. During the Final Test, Olcay skipped past the Money and Mole route, as she got lost and took too much time getting to the test. While both Jan and Ruben grabbed the extra \u20ac2,500.-. With Jan being the Mole, his \u20ac2,500.- was to fool the audiences, and it was not added to the final winner's pot of \u20ac17,750.-.\n\n==Mole Sabotage==\n\n{{Empty section|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Hidden Clues==\n\n{{Empty section|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Viewing Figures===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin:auto; text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\"| Viewing Figures\n|-\n! #\n!

(Dutch TV series)|''Wie is de Mol?'']] (\"Who is the Mole?\") aired in the winter of 2018. This was the last season with current, and longest running host, [[Art Rooijakkers]]. The season took place in [[Georgia (Country)|Georgia]], the former [[Soviet Union|Soviet Union State]]. The season premiered on January 6, 2018. The Live Finale aired on March 10, 2018 from the [[Vondelpark|VondelCS pavilion]]. During the Finale, Ruben Hein was declared the winner of the season, earning a grand total of \u20ac17,750.-. Hein had successfully unmasked [[Jan Versteegh]] as the Mole of 2018, outwitting his fellow finalist, [[Olcay Gulsen|Olcay G\u00fcl\u015fen]].\n\n==Format==\nFollowed the same format as its [[De Mol (TV series)|Belgian predecessor]], the season had ten Dutch celebrities travel to [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] to complete Assignments to earn money for the group pot. However, one of the ten is the titular Mole (de Mol), the one designated to sabotage the assignments and cause the group to earn the least amount of money for the winner's pot as possible. Every few days, players would take a 20-question [[multiple choice]] test about the identity of the Mole. Once the test is complete, the candidates await their results in an Execution ceremony. The candidate with the worst score is executed from the game, while in the event of the tie the candidate who completed their test the slowest is executed. The season plays out until there are three remaining candidates, where they must complete a final test (consisting of 40 questions). The candidate with the highest score, or had completed their test the fastest in a tie, is declared the winner and receives the group's pot.<ref>{{cite web |title=Info - Wie is de Mol? |url=https://wieisdemol.avrotros.nl/info/ |website=Wie is de Mol |publisher=AVROTROS |accessdate=23 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe season began with the candidates unknowingly scattered in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine for the first assignment to discover where the host country of the season will be, Georgia. This season also had a candidate quit in the season for the upkeep of their mental health; a series' first compared to previous medical evacuations and withdrawals. The season also changed the unmasking of the Mole. Where after the final test had been written, the finalists were informed that they would find out who the Mole is along with the rest of the Netherlands at the Live Finale. Typically the finalists would be informed of the Mole immediately after the final test and the secret would remain until the unmasking during the Live Finale broadcast.\n\n==Candidates==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\n!Name\n!Day Exited\n!Result\n|-\n|[[Jan Versteegh]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 18\n|style=background:lightgray;|'''The Mole'''\n|-\n|{{ill|Ruben Hein|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 18\n|'''Winner'''\n|-\n|[[Olcay Gulsen|Olcay G\u00fcl\u015fen]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 18\n|Runner-Up\n|-\n|{{ill|Simone Weimans|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 15\n|3rd place\n|-\n|{{ill|Stine Jensen|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 13\n|4th place\n|-\n|[[Loes Haverkort]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 9\n|5th place\n|-\n|{{ill|Emilio Guzman|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 7\n|6th place\n|-\n|{{ill|Bella Hay|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 5\n|7th place\n|-\n|[[Jean-Marc van Tol]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 3\n|Quit\n|-\n|{{ill|Ron Boszhard|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 1\n|8th place\n|}\n\n==Candidates Progress==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" border=\"2\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:96%\"\n!

With a \u20ac1,000.- note and a photograph, the group must find the vendor in the photo to exchange their note for two \u20ac500.- notes and a new photograph of the next vendor with money. The candidates have 30 minutes to exchange their money and staple to the board to cover the negative money.\n\nDespite the wind blowing off the money immediately after the time limit was up, the production was gracious and totalled up the full amount including the blown off notes.\n\nThe group earned \u20ac860.- for the pot.\n\n'''Aanschuiven (Joining In) - Max. \u20ac2,000.-'''\nAttending a performance of Julius Caesar at the Rustaveli Theatre, the candidates were separated into spectator boxes in the wings of the theatre. Throughout the performance, Art would text clues to the candidates about which box each of the candidates must be in at the end of the play. In the middle of the assignment, Ron, the first candidate executed in the game back in Moscow, texted the group that he was attending the play with them. He held crucial information for the upcoming test, and if any of the candidates were to join him in his box within the next ten minutes, he would share that knowledge and re-enter the game.\n\nThe candidates, including Ron's starting partner Loes, stopped each other from meeting with Ron, sending him home at the end of the assignment.\n\nThe candidates failed the assignment as well, and nothing was earned for the pot.\n\n'''Opscheppen (Shovel) - Max. \u20ac3,000.-'''\nUsing heavy machinery, the candidates excavate dirt in order to drive a Lada car along a path in a construction yard.

Choosing between five cars, the candidates had to pick between four cars with increasing amounts of money, and a final car with a Doubler. In a staggered start, the candidates had to drive around Stepantsminda without being trapped in by hunters in red cars. If a car is trapped before returning at the end of their 15 minutes, they are out of the assignment and earn nothing for the pot. If the Doubler car survived the assignment, all money earned in the assignment would be doubled.\n\nThree out of the five cars finished the assignment, including the Doubler car. \u20ac900 was added to the pot.\n\n'''Kwestie van Vertrouwen (A Question of Trust) - Max. \u20ac2,500.-'''\nIn the fields by the Gergeti Trinity Church, the candidates were asked to partner with someone they could trust. In their duos, the candidates will walk across a field with four boxes full of positive money, negative money, exemptions, and black exemptions. Once each duo has looked in their four respective boxes, they meet in the middle of the field with an opposing duo to share information of what they've seen. After the meeting, the duos must then select a box per candidate on the opposing side of the field to retrieve any items available. All candidates have one opportunity to walk across the field during the assignment.\n\n\u20ac1,250 was removed from the pot at the end of the assignment.\n\n'''Molcast ('Molecast') - Max. \u20ac4,000.-'''\nArt arrived at breakfast to collect all the positive and negative money from the group's treasure.

Meanwhile, the Brave team went tandem paragliding off one of the nearby mountains. Once they are up in the air, the Brave team may listen to their podcasts to answer the Organized team's questions until they touchdown. Each correct answer out of the 40 questions earned \u20ac100 for the pot.\n\nThe teams managed to answer 18 questions correctly, earning \u20ac1,800 for the pot.\n\n===Episode 4 - Vooruitzicht===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; margin: 10px\" align=\"right\" width=\"40%\"\n|-\n!colspan=3|Episode 4 - Vooruitzicht\n|-\n!colspan=3|Original airdates: 27/01/2018<br>Locations: [[Stepantsminda|Stepantsminda, Georgia]] \u2192 [[Tbilisi|Tbilisi, Georgia]] \n|-\n!

The remaining four candidates were dropped off in Tbilisi and instructed to find where the three missing candidates were hidden underground. The Underground candidates have no idea where they have been hidden, but hold the information in which the Searchers could use to find them. The underground candidates were hidden in a tunnel maze, where throughout the tunnels they could find simple instructions and photographs of where the Searchers had to go in order to receive new instructions. The Underground candidate's phone could only receive signal at a small opening far from the instructions board in the maze. With a phone in hand, the Searchers have 45 minutes to find the Underground candidates to earn \u20ac1,500 for the pot.\n\nThe candidates failed the assignment, and nothing was earned for the pot.\n\n'''Niets is Wat Het Lijkt (Nothing is What It Seems)'''\nThe day of the assignment was Georgia's independence day from the Soviet Union. The candidates were taken to the 9 April Park, for a private interrogation with Art. Between Art and the candidate stood a table with a series of flowchart questions. Before Art begins the interrogation, he informs each of the candidates that they could earn an Exemption for the Finale if they do well in this assignment. The interrogation begins with Art asking if the candidates want to know who the Mole already, with the candidate having to answer yes or no. They proceed through the flowchart answering Art's questions about their personal tactics and potential dilemmas until they reach the bottom of the table, with a final question between \u20ac5,000 for the pot, or a group exemption.\n\nAt the end of the assignment, Art informed the candidates that if they had paid enough attention, they would have noticed that they were visited by the Mole during their interrogations in the park. Essentially being the exemption to the Finale that Art mentioned at the beginning of the assignment.\n\n'''Rode Draad (Red Wire) - Max. \u20ac5,000.-'''\nThe candidates were taken to the old Soviet District in Tbilisi, a lower-class district with Soviet era accommodations. On top of one of these buildings, the candidates had to zipline between two buildings. With the questions from yesterday noted by Art, the candidates had a choice of earning \u20ac5,000 or a group exemption in this assignment. The choice that the majority had chosen would be inside one of the envelopes Art gives the candidates. The objective of the assignment was for the candidates to transport envelopes across the zipline, earning whatever they managed to bring to Art. Each candidate were allowed to take only one out of the seven envelopes while they ziplined. Ruben panicked and refused to do the zipline, which led to Stine also deciding to not complete the assignment.\n\nOnly five of the candidates completed the zipline, with Art informing the candidates afterwards that they had been competing for \u20ac5,000. After opening all the envelopes, the candidates had successfully brought the \u20ac5,000 envelope to Art, and was added to the pot.\n\n===Episode 5 - Zienswijzen===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; margin: 10px\" align=\"right\" width=\"40%\"\n|-\n!colspan=3|Episode 5 - Zienswijzen\n|-\n!colspan=3|Original airdates: 03/02/2018<br>Locations: [[Tbilisi|Tbilisi, Georgia]] \n|-\n!

Art presents a series of questions to the candidates, if they are correct, the candidate can turn a red screen green, or opt out from turning a green screen red. The candidates were divided into two teams: three designated to the red board, two assigned the green board.\n\nThe candidates chose to prevent their results from being shown, except for Simone.

As soon as they entered the Castle, they had to follow signs leading them to where their final test would be written. Two longer, diverting routes would lead the finalists to \u20ac2,500.- that they could add to the pot, or to see the Mole at the end of the longest route. However, their time for the test starts as soon as they enter the castle, so the diversions cost time on their final test.\n\nThe final amount earned for the winner's pot would be revealed during the Live Finale, where for the first time in the series' history would include the unmasking of the Mole in front of the live audience, 167 days after the final day of filming.\n\n===Episode 10 - Finale===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; margin: 10px\" align=\"right\" width=\"40%\"\n|-\n!colspan=3|Episode 10 - Finale\n|-\n!colspan=3|Original airdates: 10/03/2018<br>Locations: [[Amsterdam|Amsterdam, Netherlands]] \n|-\n!

Jan, Ruben, and Olcay arrived at Vondelpark for a final debriefing by Art. At first, Art revealed that Olcay was not the Mole nor the winner, before Jan Versteegh finally stepped forward to reveal himself as the Mole. During the reunion after the unmasking, the executed candidates revealed that it was Olcay who misled them into thinking Ruben was the Mole. Meanwhile, Ruben only started to catch onto Jan as the Mole when Loes and Stine, his two main suspects were executed one after the other. In the Final Test, Olcay answered her test thinking Ruben was the Mole, and ultimately had no chance in beating Ruben. During the Final Test, Olcay skipped past the Money and Mole route, as she got lost and took too much time getting to the test. While both Jan and Ruben grabbed the extra \u20ac2,500.-. With Jan being the Mole, his \u20ac2,500.- was to fool the audiences, and it was not added to the final winner's pot of \u20ac17,750.-.\n\n==Mole Sabotage==\n\n{{Empty section|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Hidden Clues==\n\n{{Empty section|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Viewing Figures===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin:auto; text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\"| Viewing Figures\n|-\n! #\n!

The first Romanian-owned bank had its headquarters here (The ''Albina'' Bank), as did the [[Asocia\u021bia Transilvan\u0103 pentru Literatura Rom\u00e2n\u0103 \u0219i Cultura Poporului Rom\u00e2n|ASTRA]] (Transylvanian Association for Romanian Literature and Romanian's People Culture). After the [[Romanian Orthodox]] Church was granted status in the [[Austrian Empire]] from the 1860s onwards, Sibiu became the [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan seat]], and the city is still regarded as the third-most important centre of the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]]. Between the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]] and 1867 (the year of the ''[[Ausgleich]]''), Sibiu was the meeting-place of the [[Transylvanian Diet]], which had taken its most representative form after the Empire agreed to extend voting rights in the region.\n\nAfter [[World War I]], when [[Austria-Hungary]] was dissolved, Sibiu became part of Romania; the majority of its population was still ethnic German (until 1941) and counted a large Romanian community, as well as a smaller Hungarian one. Starting from the 1950s and until after 1990, most of the city's ethnic Germans emigrated to [[Germany]] and [[Austria]].

Set in the Cibin Depression, the city is about 20&nbsp;km from the [[F\u0103g\u0103ra\u0219 Mountains]], 12&nbsp;km from the [[Cibin Mountains]], and about 15&nbsp;km from the [[Lotru Mountains]], which border the depression in its southwestern section. The northern and eastern limits of Sibiu are formed by the T\u00e2rnavelor Plateau, which descends to the Cibin Valley through Gu\u0219teri\u021bei Hill.\n \nThe Cibin river as well as some smaller streams runs through Sibiu. The geographical position of Sibiu makes it one of the most important transportation hubs in Romania with important roads and railway lines passing through it.\n\n===City districts===\nThe following districts are part of Sibiu.

The Cultural Capital status was expected to bring about an abrupt increase in quantity and quality of cultural events in 2007.\n\n==Tourism==\nIn 2007, Sibiu was the [[European Capital of Culture]] (together with [[Luxembourg (city)|Luxembourg]]). This was the most important cultural event that has ever happened in the city, and a great number of tourists came, both domestic and foreign.\n\nThe city of Sibiu and its surroundings are one of the most visited areas in Romania. It holds one of the best preserved historical sites in the country, many of its medieval fortifications having been kept in excellent state. Its old center has begun the process for becoming a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] in 2004. Sibiu and its surrounding area have many significant museums, with 12 institutions housing art collections, paintings, and exhibits in decorative arts, archeology, anthropology, history, industrial archeology and history of technology and natural sciences.\n\nThe city also lies close to the [[F\u0103g\u0103ra\u0219 Mountains]] \u2013 a popular trekking destination, close to the [[P\u0103ltini\u0219]] and Arena Platos ski resorts \u2013 both winter holiday destinations, and it is at the heart of the former Saxon communities in Transylvania renowned for its [[Villages with fortified churches in Transylvania|fortified churches]].[[File:Sibiu Biserica evanghelica Gusterita (5).JPG|thumb|Fortified Lutheran church of Gu\u0219teri\u021ba neighbourhood, 13th century]]\n\nSince 2007, a traditional [[Christmas market]] has been held in Sibiu.

The old city of Sibiu lies on the right bank of the Cibin River, on a hill situated at about 200 m from the river. It consists of two distinct entities: the ''Upper Town'' and the ''Lower Town''. Traditionally, the Upper Town was the wealthier part and commercial outlet, while the Lower Town served as the manufacturing area.\n\n'''The Lower Town'''\n\n(German: ''Unterstadt'', Romanian: ''Ora\u0219ul de jos'') comprises the area between the river and the hill, and it developed around the earliest fortifications. The streets are long and quite wide for medieval city standards, with small city squares at places. The architecture is rather rustic: typically two-storey houses with tall roofs and gates opening passages to inner courts.\n\nMost of the exterior fortifications were lost to industrial development and modern urban planning in the mid-late 19th century; only four towers still exist. A building associated with newer urbanism of the period is the ''Independen\u021ba'' Highschool.\n\nThis area has the oldest church in the city \u2013 in fact the first mention of the city itself is the reconfirmation of the local provostship as ''praepositum Cibiniensem'' \u2013 that was the religious center of the [[Transylvanian Saxons|Saxons]] until the 15th century.<ref>Magyar katolikus lexikon XII.

As the main area for [[Bourgeoisie|burgher]] activities, the area contains most points of interest in the city.\n\n'''Grand Square'''\n\n(German: ''Gro\u00dfer Ring'', Romanian: ''Pia\u021ba Mare'' ) is, as its name suggests, the [[List of town squares by size|largest square]] of the city, and has been the center of the city since the 15th century. At 142 meters long and 93 meters wide, it is one of the largest ones in Transylvania.\n\n[[Brukenthal Palace]], one of the most important [[Baroque]] monuments in Romania, lies on the north-western corner of the square. It was erected between 1777 and 1787 as the main residence for the Governor of Transylvania [[Samuel von Brukenthal]]. It houses the main part of the ''National Brukenthal Museum'', opened in 1817, making it one of the oldest museums in the world. Next to the palace is the ''Blue House'' or ''Moringer House'', an 18th-century Baroque house bearing the old coat of arms of Sibiu on its fa\u00e7ade.\n\n[[File:Sibiu (15257629580).jpg|213x213px|thumb|Sibiu City Hall]]\n\nOn the north side is the [[Jesuit Church, Sibiu|Jesuit Church]], along with its dependencies, the former residence of the Jesuits in Sibiu. Also on the north side, at the beginning of the 20th century an ''[[Art Nouveau]]'' building was constructed on the west part, now it houses the mayor's office.\n\n[[File:Podul mincinosilor.jpg|thumb|212x212px|Liars Bridge in Lesser Square, erected in 1859]]\n\nNext to the Jesuit Church on the north side is the [[Council Tower of Sibiu|Council Tower]], the city's symbol. This former fortification tower from the 13th century has been successively rebuilt over the years. The building nearby used to be the City Council's meeting place; beneath it lies an access way between the ''Grand Square'' and the ''Lesser Square''.\n\nOn the south and east sides are two- or three-storey houses, having tall attics with small windows known as the ''city's eyes''. Most of these houses are dated 15th to 19th centuries, and most of them are Renaissance or Baroque in style.\n\n'''Lesser Square'''\n(''Small Square'', German: ''Kleiner Ring'') as its name implies, is a smaller square situated in the northern part of the Upper Town. After the 2007 rehabilitation there has been an increase in the number of small businesses such as pubs and restaurants in this area.\n\nThe square is connected to the other two squares and to other streets by small, narrow passages. The main access from the Lower City is through Ocnei Street, which divides the square in two. The street passes under the ''Liar's Bridge'' \u2013 the first bridge in Romania to have been cast in iron (1859).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://welcometoromania.ro/Sibiu/Sibiu_Podul_Mincinosilor_e.htm|title=The Bridge of Lies, Sibiu\u00b7|last=WR|website=welcometoromania.ro|accessdate=28 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104171643/http://welcometoromania.ro/Sibiu/Sibiu_Podul_Mincinosilor_e.htm|archivedate=4 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nTo the right of the bridge is another symbol of the city, ''The House of the Arts'', a 14th-century arched building formerly belonging to the Butchers' Guild. On the left side of the bridge is the ''Luxemburg House'', a Baroque four-storey building.\n\n'''Huet Square'''\nis the third of the three main squares of Sibiu. Its most notable feature is the [[Sibiu Lutheran Cathedral|Evangelical Lutheran Cathedral]] in its center. It is the place where the earliest fortifications have been built in the late 12th century or early 13th century. The buildings around this square are mainly [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]]. On the west side lies the Brukenthal Highschool, in place of a former 14th-century school.\n\n[[File:Sibio, la Dika Turo de oriento, 4.jpeg|thumb|215x215px|right|[[Thalia Hall|The Thick Tower]]]]\n\n'''The Fortifications'''\nof Sibiu made the city one of the most important fortified cities in Central Europe. Multiple rings were built around the city, most of them out of clay bricks. The south-eastern fortifications are the best kept, and all three parallel lines are still visible. The first is an exterior earth mound, the second is a 10-meter-tall red brick wall, and the third line comprises towers linked by another 10-meter-tall wall. All structures are connected via a labyrinth of tunnels and passageways, designed to ensure transport between the city and lines of defense.\n\nIn the 16th century more modern elements were added to the fortifications, mainly leaf-shaped [[bastion]]s.

Also planned is a Museum of the Culture and Civilisation of the Romany People.[[File:Sibiu-park-bicycle.jpg|thumb|Bicycle riders in Sub Arini park, in Sibiu.]]\n\nThe [[Dumbrava Sibiului Natural Park]] stretches over 960 hectares and it is situated 4&nbsp;km away from the center of the city in the southwest direction along the road towards R\u0103\u015finari. Also, here you can find the Zoological Garden and Ethnography Museum.\n\nThere is a [[Sibiu Steam Locomotives Museum|Steam Locomotives Museum]] close to the railway station, sheltering around 40 [[steam locomotive|locomotives]], two of which are functional.\n\nThe first park in the city was The Promenade, later called \"The Disabled Promenade.\" established in 1791, today part of Parcul Cet\u0103\u021bii (Citadel Park). Current arrangement of the park, including the space between the walls, dates from 1928.\n\nThe Sub Arini Park, established between 1857 and 1859 based on plans of military engineer Michael Seyfried,<ref>[https://www.siebenbuerger.de/zeitung/artikel/kultur/14902-eine-graefin-mit-herz.html]</ref> is one of the biggest and best-maintained parks in Romania.

The Cultural Capital status was expected to bring about an abrupt increase in quantity and quality of cultural events in 2007.\n\n==Tourism==\nIn 2007, Sibiu was the [[European Capital of Culture]] (together with [[Luxembourg (city)|Luxembourg]]). This was the most important cultural event that has ever happened in the city, and a great number of tourists came, both domestic and foreign.\n\nThe city of Sibiu and its surroundings are one of the most visited areas in Romania. It holds one of the best preserved historical sites in the country, many of its medieval fortifications having been kept in excellent state. Its old center has begun the process for becoming a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] in 2004. Sibiu and its surrounding area have many significant museums, with 12 institutions housing art collections, paintings, and exhibits in decorative arts, archeology, anthropology, history, industrial archeology and history of technology and natural sciences.\n\nThe city also lies close to the [[F\u0103g\u0103ra\u0219 Mountains]] \u2013 a popular trekking destination, close to the [[P\u0103ltini\u0219]] and Arena Platos ski resorts \u2013 both winter holiday destinations, and it is at the heart of the former Saxon communities in Transylvania renowned for its [[Villages with fortified churches in Transylvania|fortified churches]].[[File:Sibiu Biserica evanghelica Gusterita (5).JPG|thumb|Fortified Lutheran church of Gu\u0219teri\u021ba neighbourhood, 13th century]]\n\nSince 2007, a traditional [[Christmas market]] has been held in Sibiu.

The old city of Sibiu lies on the right bank of the Cibin River, on a hill situated at about 200 m from the river. It consists of two distinct entities: the ''Upper Town'' and the ''Lower Town''. Traditionally, the Upper Town was the wealthier part and commercial outlet, while the Lower Town served as the manufacturing area.\n\n'''The Lower Town'''\n\n(German: ''Unterstadt'', Romanian: ''Ora\u0219ul de jos'') comprises the area between the river and the hill, and it developed around the earliest fortifications. The streets are long and quite wide for medieval city standards, with small city squares at places. The architecture is rather rustic: typically two-storey houses with tall roofs and gates opening passages to inner courts.\n\nMost of the exterior fortifications were lost to industrial development and modern urban planning in the mid-late 19th century; only four towers still exist. A building associated with newer urbanism of the period is the ''Independen\u021ba'' Highschool.\n\nThis area has the oldest church in the city \u2013 in fact the first mention of the city itself is the reconfirmation of the local provostship as ''praepositum Cibiniensem'' \u2013 that was the religious center of the [[Transylvanian Saxons|Saxons]] until the 15th century.<ref>Magyar katolikus lexikon XII.

As the main area for [[Bourgeoisie|burgher]] activities, the area contains most points of interest in the city.\n\n'''Grand Square'''\n\n(German: ''Gro\u00dfer Ring'', Romanian: ''Pia\u021ba Mare'' ) is, as its name suggests, the [[List of town squares by size|largest square]] of the city, and has been the center of the city since the 15th century. At 142 meters long and 93 meters wide, it is one of the largest ones in Transylvania.\n\n[[Brukenthal Palace]], one of the most important [[Baroque]] monuments in Romania, lies on the north-western corner of the square. It was erected between 1777 and 1787 as the main residence for the Governor of Transylvania [[Samuel von Brukenthal]]. It houses the main part of the ''National Brukenthal Museum'', opened in 1817, making it one of the oldest museums in the world. Next to the palace is the ''Blue House'' or ''Moringer House'', an 18th-century Baroque house bearing the old coat of arms of Sibiu on its fa\u00e7ade.\n\n[[File:Sibiu (15257629580).jpg|213x213px|thumb|Sibiu City Hall]]\n\nOn the north side is the [[Jesuit Church, Sibiu|Jesuit Church]], along with its dependencies, the former residence of the Jesuits in Sibiu. Also on the north side, at the beginning of the 20th century an ''[[Art Nouveau]]'' building was constructed on the west part, now it houses the mayor's office.\n\n[[File:Podul mincinosilor.jpg|thumb|212x212px|Liars Bridge in Lesser Square, erected in 1859]]\n\nNext to the Jesuit Church on the north side is the [[Council Tower of Sibiu|Council Tower]], the city's symbol. This former fortification tower from the 13th century has been successively rebuilt over the years. The building nearby used to be the City Council's meeting place; beneath it lies an access way between the ''Grand Square'' and the ''Lesser Square''.\n\nOn the south and east sides are two- or three-storey houses, having tall attics with small windows known as the ''city's eyes''. Most of these houses are dated 15th to 19th centuries, and most of them are Renaissance or Baroque in style.\n\n'''Lesser Square'''\n(''Small Square'', German: ''Kleiner Ring'') as its name implies, is a smaller square situated in the northern part of the Upper Town. After the 2007 rehabilitation there has been an increase in the number of small businesses such as pubs and restaurants in this area.\n\nThe square is connected to the other two squares and to other streets by small, narrow passages. The main access from the Lower City is through Ocnei Street, which divides the square in two. The street passes under the ''Liar's Bridge'' \u2013 the first bridge in Romania to have been cast in iron (1859).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://welcometoromania.ro/Sibiu/Sibiu_Podul_Mincinosilor_e.htm|title=The Bridge of Lies, Sibiu\u00b7|last=WR|website=welcometoromania.ro|accessdate=28 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104171643/http://welcometoromania.ro/Sibiu/Sibiu_Podul_Mincinosilor_e.htm|archivedate=4 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nTo the right of the bridge is another symbol of the city, ''The House of the Arts'', a 14th-century arched building formerly belonging to the Butchers' Guild. On the left side of the bridge is the ''Luxemburg House'', a Baroque four-storey building.\n\n'''Huet Square'''\nis the third of the three main squares of Sibiu. Its most notable feature is the [[Sibiu Lutheran Cathedral|Evangelical Lutheran Cathedral]] in its center. It is the place where the earliest fortifications have been built in the late 12th century or early 13th century. The buildings around this square are mainly [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]]. On the west side lies the Brukenthal Highschool, in place of a former 14th-century school.\n\n[[File:Sibio, la Dika Turo de oriento, 4.jpeg|thumb|215x215px|right|[[Thalia Hall|The Thick Tower]]]]\n\n'''The Fortifications'''\nof Sibiu made the city one of the most important fortified cities in Central Europe. Multiple rings were built around the city, most of them out of clay bricks. The south-eastern fortifications are the best kept, and all three parallel lines are still visible. The first is an exterior earth mound, the second is a 10-meter-tall red brick wall, and the third line comprises towers linked by another 10-meter-tall wall. All structures are connected via a labyrinth of tunnels and passageways, designed to ensure transport between the city and lines of defense.\n\nIn the 16th century more modern elements were added to the fortifications, mainly leaf-shaped [[bastion]]s. Two of these survived to this day, as the ''Haller Bastion'' (all the way down Coposu Boulevard) and \"Soldisch Bastion\".\n\n'''The Passage of the Stairs''',\nleads down to the lower section of Sibiu. It descends along some fortifications under the support arches. It is one of several passages linking the two sides of the old city.\n\n==Health==\n[[File:Spitalul Judetean Sibiu.jpg|thumb|Sibiu County Hospital]]\nSibiu is one of the important medical centers of Romania, housing many important medical facilities:\n* County Hospital\n* Academic Emergency Hospital;\n* Hospital of Pediatrics;\n* Military Emergency Hospital;\n* CFR Hospital (Romanian Railways Hospital);\n* \"Dr. Gheorghe Preda\" Psychiatry Hospital\n* other smaller private clinics\n\nThe city also houses one of the largest private hospitals in the country, Polisano.\n\n==Education==\n\n[[File:Liceul Samuel von Brukenthal.jpg|thumb|Samuel von Brukenthal High School]]\n\nSibiu is an important centre of higher education, with over 23,000 students in four public and private higher institutions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ulbsibiu.ro/en/despre_ulbs/|title=:: L B U S :: About LBUS|first=Departamentul de Comunica\u0163ii \u0219i Marketing al|last=ULBS|website=www.ulbsibiu.ro|accessdate=28 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404104637/http://www.ulbsibiu.ro/en/despre_ulbs/|archivedate=4 April 2015}}</ref><ref>[http://www.mediafax.ro/social/reportaj-sefa-de-promotie-la-academia-fortelor-terestre-a-fost-o-lupta-intre-a-rezista-si-a-avea-vointa-foto-12957248 Land Forces Military Academy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150130124204/http://www.mediafax.ro/social/reportaj-sefa-de-promotie-la-academia-fortelor-terestre-a-fost-o-lupta-intre-a-rezista-si-a-avea-vointa-foto-12957248 |date=2015-01-30 }} at mediafax.ro</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roger-univ.ro/universitate/prezentare-urgs.html|title=Universitatea Romano-Germana din Sibiu|website=www.roger-univ.ro|accessdate=28 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219173051/http://www.roger-univ.ro/universitate/prezentare-urgs.html|archivedate=19 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uamsibiu.ro/universitate/istoric/|title=Istoricul Universitatii Alma Mater Sibiu \u2013 Universitatea Alma Mater Sibiu|website=www.uamsibiu.ro|accessdate=28 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150504160830/http://www.uamsibiu.ro/universitate/istoric/|archivedate=4 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu]] was founded in 1990, with five faculties: Engineering and Sciences; Language Sciences; History and Law; Medicine; Food and Textile Processing Technology.

Fransman received 14 votes compared Zille's 27 votes.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.news24.com/Elections/News/Zille-re-elected-Western-Cape-premier-20140521 |title=Zille re-elected Western Cape premier |access-date=2018-12-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181205124510/https://www.news24.com/Elections/News/Zille-re-elected-Western-Cape-premier-20140521 |archive-date=2018-12-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nFransman had also challenged and criticised the Western Cape Government and the Democratic Alliance on its policy positions. Fransman won re-election unopposed to a second term at the party's conference in 2015.<ref>[https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Fransman-re-elected-as-WCape-ANC-chair-20150628 Fransman re-elected as Western Cape ANC Chair]</ref>\n\n===Sexual harassment allegations===\nFransman was accused of [[sexual assault]] by his assistant, Louisa Wynand. Fransman was alleged to have sexually assaulted Wynand while ''en route'' to the African National Congress's 104th birthday celebrations in [[Rustenburg]] in January 2016. Fransman strongly denied these claims. The Democratic Alliance, as well as party officials from the African National Congress, called for him to step down. The party quickly suspended Fransman as chairperson pending an investigation into the alleged assault claims. Deputy Chairperson, Khaya Magaxa, was designated as Fransman's acting successor. On 16 February 2016, it was announced that Magaxa would succeed Fransman as Leader of the Opposition in the Western Cape Provincial Parliament. The ANC said that Magaxa would replace Fransman until all the internal processes had been completed.<ref>[https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/khaya-magaxa-replaces-fransman-in-western-cape-legislature-20160216 Khaya Magaxa replaces Fransman in the Western Cape legislature]</ref>\n\nFransman had received quite a lot of support during this period. In February 2016, a Facebook page was created with the name, ''Friends of Marius Fransman''. On the page, a prayer service was organised for the Fransman family. The service was later held in Vredendal. In April 2016, the secretary of the provincial ANC Youth League called for the reinstatement of Fransman.<ref>[https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/western-cape-ancyl-distances-itself-from-calls-for-fransmans-return-20160415 Western Cape ANCYL distances itself from calls for Fransman's return]</ref><ref>[https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/thousands-join-friends-of-fransman-facebook-page-20160206 Thousands join 'Friends of Fransman' Facebook page]</ref>\n\nIn May 2016, the National Prosecuting Authority announced that the charges against Fransman had been dropped due to a lack of evidence. The African National Congress continued with its own party investigation.<ref>[https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/sexual-harrassment-charges-dropped-against-fransman-npa-20160523 Sexual harassment charges dropped against Fransman - NPA]</ref>\n\nIn June 2016, the African National Congress Women's League stated that the organisation would not support Fransman, as well as his accuser.<ref>[https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/ancwl-wont-support-comrade-fransman-20160623 ANCWL won't support 'comrade' Fransman]</ref>\n\nIn July 2016, an ANC official claimed that Fransman had returned to his position. ANC Secretary-General, [[Gwede Mantashe]], criticised the party official who made the false announcement. Fransman brought forward a court application to get reinstated as chairperson.<ref>[https://www.news24.com/Elections/News/mantashe-hits-out-at-zuma-mokonyane-for-endorsing-fransman-20160725 Fransman is not back - Mantashe]</ref>\n\nIn August 2016, the African National Congress's support in the Western Cape significantly decreased. The party lost many wards and municipalities to the Democratic Alliance.\n\n===Resignation and suspension===\nIn September 2016, Fransman resigned as a Member of the Western Cape Provincial Parliament, yet he did not step down from the position of provincial chairperson.<ref>[https://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/fransman-quits-western-cape-legislature-2069302 Fransman quits Western Cape leader]</ref>\n\nIn November 2016, the National Disciplinary Committee of the African National Congress found Fransman guilty on two counts of misconduct and suspended his party membership for five years, consequently removing him as chairperson of the provincial branch.<ref>[https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/anc-suspends-marius-fransman-for-5-years-20161110 ANC suspends Marius Fransman for five years]</ref>\n\n==Post-political career==\nIn March 2017, Fransman threw his support behind chairperson of Nelson Mandela Bay African National Congress branch, Andile Lunigsa, as senior ANC party officials called for Lungisa's resignation.<ref>[https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/marius-fransmans-ode-to-andile-lungisa-20170323 Marius Fransman's ode to Andile Lungisa]</ref>\n\nFransman, who is an avid supporter of Jacob Zuma, also announced in March 2017, that he is elated that Zuma reshuffled his cabinet and praised the appointments of the new ministers.
