The team previously competed in the trans-Tasman [[ANZ Championship]]. The Swifts were formed in 2007 as an amalgamation of two teams from the [[Commonwealth Bank Trophy]] (CBT) \u2013 the [[Sydney Swifts]] and the [[Hunter Jaegers]]. The Swifts have been a moderately successful team in Australian netball, winning two premierships and losing two grand finals in their history.\n\nThe Swifts are currently coached by Briony Akle, who replaced previous coach Rob Wright after the 2017 season. The club has played home games at the [[Sydney Olympic Park Tennis Centre|Ken Rosewall Arena]], located in [[Sydney Olympic Park]]. The team uniform is primarily red with white and light blue.\n\n==Players==\n<!-- See [[Template:ANZC roster doc]] -->\n{{ANZC roster header |year=2020 |team=NSW Swifts}}\n<!-- List of players -->\n\n{{ANZC roster player |nat=AUS |name=[[Sophie Garbin]] |pos=GS, GA |dob=06 April 1997 |height=1.84}}\n{{ANZC roster player |nat=AUS |name=[[Paige Hadley]] |pos=C, WA, WD |dob=26 August 1992 |height=1.73 |vc=yes}}\n{{ANZC roster player |nat=NZL |name=[[Kayla Cullen]] |pos=WD, GD, C |dob=13 February 1992 |height=1.83 }}\n{{ANZC roster player |nat=ENG |name=[[Natalie Haythornthwaite]] |pos=WA, GA |dob=09 December 1992|height=1.74 }}\n{{ANZC roster player |nat=ENG |name=[[Helen Housby]] |pos=GA, GS |dob=19 January 1995 |height=1.83}}\n{{ANZC roster player |nat=AUS |name=[[Sarah Klau]] |pos=GK, GD |dob=30 September 1994 |height=1.90}}\n{{ANZC roster player |nat=AUS |name=[[Lauren Moore]] |pos=GD, WD, GK |dob=30 January 1998 |height=1.84 |inj = yes}}\n{{ANZC roster player |nat=AUS |name=[[Maddy Proud]] |pos=C, WA |dob=04 December 1993 |height=1.74 |capt=yes |inj=yes}}\n{{ANZC roster player |nat=AUS |name=[[Maddy Turner]] |pos=GD, GK, WD |dob=17 December 1995 |height=1.83}}\n{{ANZC roster player |nat=TTO |name=[[Samantha Wallace]] |pos=GS |dob=16 January 1994 |height=1.93}}\n\n<!-- Coaching staff -->\n{{ANZC roster footer\n| head_coach  = {{flagicon|AUS}} Briony Akle\n| assistant_coach  = {{flagicon|AUS}} [[Megan Anderson]]\n| updated     = 14/10/2019\n| url_team    = http://www.nswswifts.com.au/26895-2\n| url_anzc    = https://supernetball.com.au/teams/nsw-swifts/\n}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and inaugural season, 2007-2008===\nThe [[ANZ Championship]] was founded in 2007 as the new elite domestic netball competition in [[New Zealand]] and Australia.

This was enough for the Swifts to win the cup and $10,000.\n\nIn the [[ANZ Championship]], the Swifts won there first game against the [[Canterbury Tactix]] (the only team the Swifts didn't win in 2008) by seventeen goals and claimed the top spot in the ladder after round one. In round two, after a well fought game against the [[Adelaide Thunderbirds]], the Swifts lost by one goal. In round three, the Swifts lost by 18 goals to the [[Waikato Bay of Plenty Magic]]. During that game, the Swifts lost Bulley for falling on the ground head first, Cox after a bad landing on Tod's foot and nearly lost Pettitt after falling down heavily. Despite Cox missing one shot, Pettitt missing three shots and Bell missing two, it wasn't enough to beat van Dyk's perfect accuracy and Tutaia's one miss. In round four, the Swifts are against the [[Northern Mystics]] and despite Cox missing three shots in the final quarter and scoring no rebounds against Latu (who shot 38/40), Cookey and Rasmussen, the Swifts won 59-55 to maintain their winning streak at home. However, after that, the Swifts lost the next 9 games in a row and fell down to 9th place.\n\nAfter their win against the [[Canterbury Tactix]], the NSW Swifts are the first ever team to win against every opposition. Waikato/Bay of Plenty Magic was the second team to achieve this after defeating both the Swifts and Vixens in 2009.\n\n'''2009 NSW Swifts Team:'''\n[[Catherine Cox]] (Captain), [[Erin Bell]], [[Rebecca Bulley]], [[Kimberlee Green]], [[Emma Koster]], [[Ashlee Mann]], [[Jessica Mansell]], [[Samantha May]], [[Susan Pettitt]], [[Kimberley Purcell]], [[Vanessa Ware]], [[Amorette Wild]].\n\n'''Coaching and Support Staff:'''\nCoach - Julie Fitzgerald, Assistant Coach - Tracey Robinson, Manager \u2013 Jan Troy, Physiotherapist \u2013 Sean Mungovan, Strength and Conditioning \u2013 Bryce Cavanagh\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|+ Summary of 2009 player movements\n! width=300 | {{Gain}} Gains !! width=300 | {{Loss}} Losses\n|-\n| \n* [[Jessica Mansell]]\n* [[Ashlee Mann]]\n* [[Samantha May]]\n* [[Amorette Wild]]\n|\n* [[Selina Gilsenan]] (retired)\n* [[Adelaide Johnson (netball)|Adelaide Johnson]]\n* [[Tiffany Lincoln]]\n* [[Leah Shoard]] (Steel)\n|}\n\nAfter a shocking performance in 2009, the Swifts recruited England defender [[Sonia Mkoloma]] to their team. This is the first time that the Swifts have added an international player to their squad. They were the last team in the history of the ANZ Championship to recruit an international player (the Swifts were the only team not to have an import player since the start of the competition). This year, the co-vice captains for the team are [[Kimberlee Green]] and [[Kimberley Smith (netball player)|Kimberly Smith]]. In addition, the Swifts have a new assistant coach Robert Wright, current NSW Institute of Sport Development Coach. Wright is officially the first male assistant coach in the [[ANZ Championship]] history.\n\nDuring the off-season, Kimberly Borger from the AIS was added to the squad, but a serious injury meant that she wasn't able to begin her debut for the Swifts. As a result, former Hunter Jaegar member Lara Welham replaced Borger. During the pre-season, Cox was rested due to her ankle injury and wasn't able to take part in both the pre-season training and the SOPA Cup. In the SOPA Cup, the Swifts won five of the seven games, only losing to the [[West Coast Fever]] and the eventual pre-season winners [[Queensland Firebirds]].\n\nIn the [[ANZ Championship]], many experts believed that the Swifts won't be able to reach the top 4 due to their poor performance last year. As a result, this was the Swifts year of redemption in hopes to return to the top (similar to the [[Melbourne Vixens]] in 2009). In round 1, the Swifts upset the Firebirds at Gold Coast by three goals and Cox was named player of the match. In round 2, the Swifts won against the Thunderbirds at their home ground. In round 3, the Swifts played against the Tactix, where the Swifts lost to them at Christchurch in 2008. After the end of regulation time, the game was a draw and extra time had to be played. Cox made a bold move to bench herself due to her poor performance on court for youngster Wild and the Swifts won the match 56-53. In round 4, during the first half, the last place Pulse led the Swifts as much as seven. After trailing by five goals after the first half, the Swifts scored the first ten goals in the second half and won the match 50-36. In round 5, despite conceding the first three goals against the Fever, the Swifts played their best performance after five rounds to win 55-43.\n\nIn round 6, the Swifts had a bye after their five match winning streak. It was in this round that the Swifts were the only team not to have a loss when the Vixens had a surprise loss against the Firebirds. In round 7, the Swifts led by one goal at three quarter time, despite trailing by one goal after the first few minutes of the final quarter, the Swifts won the match by 14 goals. In round 8, the Swifts defeated the Thunderbirds and broke their four match winning streak. In round 9, the Swifts defeated the Firebirds and broke their four match winning streak as well. In round 10, the Swifts were comfortable winners against the Fever. In round 11, the Swifts defeated the Mystics and [[Maria Tutaia]] was sent off with about a minute and a half of play for persistent breaking on the centre pass. Before round 12, during training, [[Vanessa Ware]] suffered a serious knee injury that required reconstruction and not only did it end Ware's season, it also blew away any chance of possible selection into the Diamonds squad. In round 12, the Swifts defeated the Magic despite them having [[Jade Clarke]] and not having [[Vanessa Ware]]. In round 13, after the scores the tied at half time, the Swifts managed to win by 12 goals against the Vixens in Melbourne. Also during this match, not only was [[Catherine Cox]] awarded player of the match, Cox became the second player ever to play 200 games in the domestic league (the first was [[Sharelle McMahon]]) and received a bouquet of flowers from [[Sharelle McMahon]]. Also, the Swifts won back the Sargeant McKinnis Cup back from the Vixens. In round 14, the Swifts defeated the Steel. As a result, the Swifts were officially the first ever team to go undefeated in the regular season.\n\n'''2010 NSW Swifts Team:'''\n[[Catherine Cox]] (Captain), [[Ashleigh Brazill]], [[Rebecca Bulley]], Kristy Guthrie, [[Kimberlee Green]], [[Samantha May]], [[Sonia Mkoloma]], [[Susan Pettitt]], [[Kimberley Purcell]], [[Courtney Tairi]], [[Vanessa Ware]], Lara Welham, [[Amorette Wild]].\n\n'''Coaching and Support Staff:'''\nCoach - Julie Fitzgerald, Assistant Coach - Rob Wright, Manager - Angela Kerr, Physiotherapists - Sean Mungovan and Paula Peralta, Strength and Conditioning - Bryce Cavanagh\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|+ Summary of 2010 player movements\n! width=300 | {{Gain}} Gains !! width=300 | {{Loss}} Losses\n|-\n| \n* [[Sonia Mkoloma]] (Tactix)\n* [[Courtney Tairi]] (AIS)\n* [[Ashleigh Brazill]]\n* Lara Welham\n* Kristy Guthrie (Replacement Player)\n|\n* [[Erin Bell]] (Thunderbirds)\n* [[Emma Koster]]\n* [[Jessica Mansell]]\n* [[Ashlee Mann]]\n|}\n\nAfter missing out on a spot in last years grand final, the Swifts recruited Mo'onia Gerrard from the [[Adelaide Thunderbirds]]. In addition, the Swifts also recruited veteran [[Carla Dziwoki]] after making a great impact at both in state league and in the Australian National League as well as forming a great shooting combination with current Swifts player Amy Wild. The Swifts are one of only two teams not to have any new players in their team (the other is the Pulse). However, the Swifts have used players not in the main squad during pre-season matches against the Mystics including [[April Letton]], FastNet Diamonds defender.\n\n'''2011 NSW Swifts Team:'''\n[[Catherine Cox]] (Captain), [[Ashleigh Brazill]], [[Rebecca Bulley]], [[Carla Dziwoki]], Mo'onia Gerrard, [[Kimberlee Green]] (Co-Vice Captain), [[Sonia Mkoloma]], [[Susan Pettitt]], [[Kimberley Smith (netball player)]] (Co-Vice Captain), [[Courtney Tairi]], [[Vanessa Ware]], [[Amorette Wild]].\n\n'''Coaching and Support Staff'''\nCoach - Julie Fitzgerald, Assistant Coach - Rob Wright, Manager - Angela Kerr, Physiotherapists - Sean Mungovan and Paula Peralta, Strength and Conditioning - Bryce Cavanagh\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|+ Summary of 2011 player movements\n! width=300 | {{Gain}} Gains !! width=300 | {{Loss}} Losses\n|-\n| \n* [[Carla Dziwoki]] (Firebirds 2009)\n* Mo'onia Gerrard (Thunderbirds 2008-2010)\n|\n* [[Samantha May]]\n* Kristy Guthrie\n* Lara Welham\n|}\n\nThe 2012 Season sees many of the [[NSW Swifts]] players departing and many players coming in. The major loss is that of [[Catherine Cox]], the team's captain who has been with the Swifts since The Commonwealth Bank Trophy and will be leaving to the [[West Coast Fever]] after she was stripped of her captaincy role and was told she was 'not needed' at the Swifts by Lisa Beehag, the 2012 Swifts' Coach. [[Rebecca Bulley]] has left to the [[Adelaide Thunderbirds]], [[Courtney Tairi]] has left for the [[Southern Steel]] and [[Kimberley Smith (netball player)]] has announced her retirement earlier in 2011. Joanna Sutton from the [[Adelaide Thunderbirds]] has been signed for the Swifts as well as former Swifts [[Samantha May]].

Record scorelines, record crowds, and record memberships, all reflect the growing popularity of the world\u2019s premier domestic netball competition, [[ANZ Championship]].\nWhile the [[NSW Swifts]] did not feature in the Finals this year, the team won many admirers throughout the competition for their never-say-die attitude, contesting a number of close matches down to the wire. In years to come, 2013 will be remembered for a series of feats. As a roster, there were ten player milestones celebrated, a debut for NSW netballing \u201cTalent\u201d, and players rewarded with selection in Australian representative squads. NSW Swifts\u2019 athletes were named the game MVP on six occasions, and the Club retained the Sargeant-McKinnis Cup for a fourth straight season with a stirring nine-goal away victory over the [[Melbourne Vixens]]. The NSW Swifts also enjoyed record Membership in 2013, and the Club\u2019s Round 11 game against the [[Adelaide Thunderbirds]] at [[Allphones Arena]] saw a new NSW Swifts\u2019 regular season home crowd record of 8,021. 2013 will also be remembered as the season the Club celebrated the career and contribution of [[Vanessa Ware]], who after 107 games as a Swift decided to hang up the netball shoes at season\u2019s end. Mo\u2019onia Gerrard also announced she was taking a break from playing elite netball during the 2014 [[ANZ Championship]] to pursue her Olympic Rugby Sevens dream, but will remain part of the Club with a role in the restructured Swifts\u2019 coaching panel next season.\n\n'''2013 NSW Swifts Team:'''\nMo'onia Gerrard (Co-Captain), [[Kimberlee Green]] (Co-Captain), [[Susan Pettitt]] (Vice-Captain), [[Carla Dziwoki]], [[Paige Hadley]], [[April Letton]], [[Samantha May]], [[Sonia Mkoloma]], Melissa Tallent, [[Vanessa Ware]], [[Ashlee Weir]], [[Amorette Wild]].\n\n'''Coaching and Support Staff:'''\nHead Coach - Lisa Beehag, Assistant Coach - Rob Wright, Manager - Toni Kidwell, Physiotherapists - Brett Doring and Paula Peralta and Daniel Vukovic, Strength & Conditioning Coach - Damien Austin, Doctor - Dr Grace Bryant\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|+ Summary of 2013 player movements\n! width=300 | {{Gain}} Gains !! width=300 | {{Loss}} Losses\n|-\n| \n* [[Paige Hadley]] (2012 NSW Swifts Replacement Player)\n* Melissa Tallent\n* [[Ashlee Weir]] (Former NSW Swifts player)\n|\n* Kimberly Borger\n* Kristy Guthrie\n* Joanne Sutton (Retired)\n|}\n\nThe 2014 [[ANZ Championship]] season was another record-breaking year for the [[NSW Swifts]], both on and off the court.  From record Membership numbers to record crowd numbers, the Swifts also featured in the Finals Series for the first time since 2011.\n\nWe celebrated our highest Membership numbers to date with 1,676 signing up to cheer from the Red Zone, as well as setting a new [[ANZ Championship]] regular season crowd of 10,118 at [[Allphones Arena]] \u2013 smashing the previous record of 8,509.\n\nThe Club welcomed a new Head Coach \u2013 albeit a familiar face \u2013 in Rob Wright, as well as six new recruits in the playing roster, including three [[ANZ Championship]] debutants. The team faced many challenges at the beginning of their 2014 campaign, from developing new combinations to season-ending injuries.  But with skill and sheer determination, the Swifts finished the regular season in third place to host Waikato/Bay of Plenty Magic in the Minor Semi Final.\n\nThe roster\u2019s outstanding performances throughout the season were acknowledged with higher honours; four Swifts were selected in the 2014 Australian Diamonds squad, three athletes will represent Australia at the [[2014 Commonwealth Games]], with a further player named in the Australian 21/U squad, as well as league honours for [[Susan Pettitt]] and [[Kimberlee Green]] \u2013 voted into the 2014 FOXTEL [[ANZ Championship]] All-Star Team, and an ANZ Championship joint-Most Valuable Player nod for Green.\n\n'''2014 NSW Swifts Team:'''\n[[Kimberlee Green]] (Captain), [[Carla Dziwoki]], [[Paige Hadley]], Madeline Hay, [[Sharni Layton]], [[April Letton]], [[Abbey McCulloch]], [[Brooke Miller]], [[Sonia Mkoloma]], [[Susan Pettitt]], [[Gretel Tippett]], [[Caitlin Thwaites]], [[Sarah Wall]].\n\n'''Coaching and Support Staff:'''\nHead Coach - Rob Wright, Assistant Coach - [[Megan Anderson]], Technical Assistant Coach - Anita Keelan, Contracted Defensive Specialist Coach - Mo'onia Gerrard, Contacted Midcourt Specialist Coach - Megan Simpson, Apprentice Coaches - Briony Akle and Moira Gaha, Team Manager - Toni Kidwell, Performance Analyst - Bjorn Maddern, Physiotherapists - Paula Peralta and Brett Doring and Daniel Vukovic, Netball NSW Strength & Conditioning Coach - Jason Howell\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|+ Summary of 2014 player movements\n! width=300 | {{Gain}} Gains !! width=300 | {{Loss}} Losses\n|-\n| \n* Madeline Hay (New Recruit)\n* [[Sharni Layton]] (Thunderbirds)\n* [[Abbey McCulloch]] (Firebirds)\n* [[Brooke Miller]] (New Recruit)\n* [[Gretel Tippett]] (New Recruit)\n* [[Caitlin Thwaites]] (Pulse)\n* [[Sarah Wall]] (Permanent Replacement Player)\n|\n* Mo'onia Gerrard (Rugby Sevens)\n* [[Samantha May]] (Hertfordshire Mavericks)\n* Melissa Tallent\n* [[Vanessa Ware]]\n* [[Ashlee Weir]]\n* [[Amorette Wild]] (Firebirds)\n|}\n\n'''2015 NSW Swifts Team:'''\n[[Jade Clarke]], [[Julie Corletto]], [[Taylah Davies]], [[Kimberlee Green]], [[Paige Hadley]], [[Erin Hoare]], [[Sharni Layton]], [[Abbey McCulloch]], [[Susan Pettitt]], [[Caitlin Thwaites]], [[Micaela Wilson]], [[Stephanie Wood]]\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|+ Summary of 2015 player movements\n! width=400 | {{Gain}} Gains !! width=400 | {{Loss}} Losses\n|-\n| \n* [[Jade Clarke]] (Tactix)\n* [[Julie Corletto]] (Mystics)\n* [[Taylah Davies]] (2014 NSW Swifts Replacement Player)\n* [[Erin Hoare]] (Vixens)\n* [[Micaela Wilson]] (2014 NSW Swifts Replacement Player)\n* [[Stephanie Wood]]\n|\n* [[Carla Dziwoki]] (Vixens)\n* Madeline Hay\n* [[April Letton]] (Fever)\n* [[Brooke Miller]]\n* [[Sonia Mkoloma]]\n* [[Gretel Tippett]] (Firebirds)\n* [[Sarah Wall]]\n|}\n\n===Super Netball, 2017-present===\nThe Swifts entered the new [[Suncorp Super Netball]] league in 2017 with head coach Rob Wright, however the team struggled to compete against their newer, higher-ranked opponents who had poached several of their best players before the start of the competition.

Other venues it has played home matches at in the past include [[Newcastle Entertainment Centre]] and [[AIS Arena]] in [[Canberra]].\n\n==Competitive record==\n=== ANZ Championship ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%; text-align: center; width: 85%; margin:1em auto;\"\n|-\n!

The club has played home games at the [[Sydney Olympic Park Tennis Centre|Ken Rosewall Arena]], located in [[Sydney Olympic Park]].

This was enough for the Swifts to win the cup and $10,000.\n\nIn the [[ANZ Championship]], the Swifts won there first game against the [[Canterbury Tactix]] (the only team the Swifts didn't win in 2008) by seventeen goals and claimed the top spot in the ladder after round one. In round two, after a well fought game against the [[Adelaide Thunderbirds]], the Swifts lost by one goal. In round three, the Swifts lost by 18 goals to the [[Waikato Bay of Plenty Magic]]. During that game, the Swifts lost Bulley for falling on the ground head first, Cox after a bad landing on Tod's foot and nearly lost Pettitt after falling down heavily. Despite Cox missing one shot, Pettitt missing three shots and Bell missing two, it wasn't enough to beat van Dyk's perfect accuracy and Tutaia's one miss. In round four, the Swifts are against the [[Northern Mystics]] and despite Cox missing three shots in the final quarter and scoring no rebounds against Latu (who shot 38/40), Cookey and Rasmussen, the Swifts won 59-55 to maintain their winning streak at home. However, after that, the Swifts lost the next 9 games in a row and fell down to 9th place.\n\nAfter their win against the [[Canterbury Tactix]], the NSW Swifts are the first ever team to win against every opposition. Waikato/Bay of Plenty Magic was the second team to achieve this after defeating both the Swifts and Vixens in 2009.\n\n'''2009 NSW Swifts Team:'''\n[[Catherine Cox]] (Captain), [[Erin Bell]], [[Rebecca Bulley]], [[Kimberlee Green]], [[Emma Koster]], [[Ashlee Mann]], [[Jessica Mansell]], [[Samantha May]], [[Susan Pettitt]], [[Kimberley Purcell]], [[Vanessa Ware]], [[Amorette Wild]].\n\n'''Coaching and Support Staff:'''\nCoach - Julie Fitzgerald, Assistant Coach - Tracey Robinson, Manager \u2013 Jan Troy, Physiotherapist \u2013 Sean Mungovan, Strength and Conditioning \u2013 Bryce Cavanagh\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|+ Summary of 2009 player movements\n! width=300 | {{Gain}} Gains !! width=300 | {{Loss}} Losses\n|-\n| \n* [[Jessica Mansell]]\n* [[Ashlee Mann]]\n* [[Samantha May]]\n* [[Amorette Wild]]\n|\n* [[Selina Gilsenan]] (retired)\n* [[Adelaide Johnson (netball)|Adelaide Johnson]]\n* [[Tiffany Lincoln]]\n* [[Leah Shoard]] (Steel)\n|}\n\nAfter a shocking performance in 2009, the Swifts recruited England defender [[Sonia Mkoloma]] to their team. This is the first time that the Swifts have added an international player to their squad. They were the last team in the history of the ANZ Championship to recruit an international player (the Swifts were the only team not to have an import player since the start of the competition). This year, the co-vice captains for the team are [[Kimberlee Green]] and [[Kimberley Smith (netball player)|Kimberly Smith]]. In addition, the Swifts have a new assistant coach Robert Wright, current NSW Institute of Sport Development Coach. Wright is officially the first male assistant coach in the [[ANZ Championship]] history.\n\nDuring the off-season, Kimberly Borger from the AIS was added to the squad, but a serious injury meant that she wasn't able to begin her debut for the Swifts. As a result, former Hunter Jaegar member Lara Welham replaced Borger. During the pre-season, Cox was rested due to her ankle injury and wasn't able to take part in both the pre-season training and the SOPA Cup. In the SOPA Cup, the Swifts won five of the seven games, only losing to the [[West Coast Fever]] and the eventual pre-season winners [[Queensland Firebirds]].\n\nIn the [[ANZ Championship]], many experts believed that the Swifts won't be able to reach the top 4 due to their poor performance last year. As a result, this was the Swifts year of redemption in hopes to return to the top (similar to the [[Melbourne Vixens]] in 2009). In round 1, the Swifts upset the Firebirds at Gold Coast by three goals and Cox was named player of the match. In round 2, the Swifts won against the Thunderbirds at their home ground. In round 3, the Swifts played against the Tactix, where the Swifts lost to them at Christchurch in 2008. After the end of regulation time, the game was a draw and extra time had to be played. Cox made a bold move to bench herself due to her poor performance on court for youngster Wild and the Swifts won the match 56-53. In round 4, during the first half, the last place Pulse led the Swifts as much as seven. After trailing by five goals after the first half, the Swifts scored the first ten goals in the second half and won the match 50-36. In round 5, despite conceding the first three goals against the Fever, the Swifts played their best performance after five rounds to win 55-43.\n\nIn round 6, the Swifts had a bye after their five match winning streak. It was in this round that the Swifts were the only team not to have a loss when the Vixens had a surprise loss against the Firebirds. In round 7, the Swifts led by one goal at three quarter time, despite trailing by one goal after the first few minutes of the final quarter, the Swifts won the match by 14 goals. In round 8, the Swifts defeated the Thunderbirds and broke their four match winning streak. In round 9, the Swifts defeated the Firebirds and broke their four match winning streak as well. In round 10, the Swifts were comfortable winners against the Fever. In round 11, the Swifts defeated the Mystics and [[Maria Tutaia]] was sent off with about a minute and a half of play for persistent breaking on the centre pass. Before round 12, during training, [[Vanessa Ware]] suffered a serious knee injury that required reconstruction and not only did it end Ware's season, it also blew away any chance of possible selection into the Diamonds squad. In round 12, the Swifts defeated the Magic despite them having [[Jade Clarke]] and not having [[Vanessa Ware]]. In round 13, after the scores the tied at half time, the Swifts managed to win by 12 goals against the Vixens in Melbourne. Also during this match, not only was [[Catherine Cox]] awarded player of the match, Cox became the second player ever to play 200 games in the domestic league (the first was [[Sharelle McMahon]]) and received a bouquet of flowers from [[Sharelle McMahon]]. Also, the Swifts won back the Sargeant McKinnis Cup back from the Vixens. In round 14, the Swifts defeated the Steel. As a result, the Swifts were officially the first ever team to go undefeated in the regular season.\n\n'''2010 NSW Swifts Team:'''\n[[Catherine Cox]] (Captain), [[Ashleigh Brazill]], [[Rebecca Bulley]], Kristy Guthrie, [[Kimberlee Green]], [[Samantha May]], [[Sonia Mkoloma]], [[Susan Pettitt]], [[Kimberley Purcell]], [[Courtney Tairi]], [[Vanessa Ware]], Lara Welham, [[Amorette Wild]].\n\n'''Coaching and Support Staff:'''\nCoach - Julie Fitzgerald, Assistant Coach - Rob Wright, Manager - Angela Kerr, Physiotherapists - Sean Mungovan and Paula Peralta, Strength and Conditioning - Bryce Cavanagh\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|+ Summary of 2010 player movements\n! width=300 | {{Gain}} Gains !! width=300 | {{Loss}} Losses\n|-\n| \n* [[Sonia Mkoloma]] (Tactix)\n* [[Courtney Tairi]] (AIS)\n* [[Ashleigh Brazill]]\n* Lara Welham\n* Kristy Guthrie (Replacement Player)\n|\n* [[Erin Bell]] (Thunderbirds)\n* [[Emma Koster]]\n* [[Jessica Mansell]]\n* [[Ashlee Mann]]\n|}\n\nAfter missing out on a spot in last years grand final, the Swifts recruited Mo'onia Gerrard from the [[Adelaide Thunderbirds]]. In addition, the Swifts also recruited veteran [[Carla Dziwoki]] after making a great impact at both in state league and in the Australian National League as well as forming a great shooting combination with current Swifts player Amy Wild. The Swifts are one of only two teams not to have any new players in their team (the other is the Pulse). However, the Swifts have used players not in the main squad during pre-season matches against the Mystics including [[April Letton]], FastNet Diamonds defender.\n\n'''2011 NSW Swifts Team:'''\n[[Catherine Cox]] (Captain), [[Ashleigh Brazill]], [[Rebecca Bulley]], [[Carla Dziwoki]], Mo'onia Gerrard, [[Kimberlee Green]] (Co-Vice Captain), [[Sonia Mkoloma]], [[Susan Pettitt]], [[Kimberley Smith (netball player)]] (Co-Vice Captain), [[Courtney Tairi]], [[Vanessa Ware]], [[Amorette Wild]].\n\n'''Coaching and Support Staff'''\nCoach - Julie Fitzgerald, Assistant Coach - Rob Wright, Manager - Angela Kerr, Physiotherapists - Sean Mungovan and Paula Peralta, Strength and Conditioning - Bryce Cavanagh\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|+ Summary of 2011 player movements\n! width=300 | {{Gain}} Gains !! width=300 | {{Loss}} Losses\n|-\n| \n* [[Carla Dziwoki]] (Firebirds 2009)\n* Mo'onia Gerrard (Thunderbirds 2008-2010)\n|\n* [[Samantha May]]\n* Kristy Guthrie\n* Lara Welham\n|}\n\nThe 2012 Season sees many of the [[NSW Swifts]] players departing and many players coming in. The major loss is that of [[Catherine Cox]], the team's captain who has been with the Swifts since The Commonwealth Bank Trophy and will be leaving to the [[West Coast Fever]] after she was stripped off her captaincy role and was told she was 'not needed' at the Swifts by Lisa Beehag, the 2012 Swifts' Coach. [[Rebecca Bulley]] has left to the [[Adelaide Thunderbirds]], [[Courtney Tairi]] has left for the [[Southern Steel]] and [[Kimberley Smith (netball player)]] has announced her retirement earlier in 2011.

Record scorelines, record crowds, and record memberships, all reflect the growing popularity of the world\u2019s premier domestic netball competition, [[ANZ Championship]].\nWhile the [[NSW Swifts]] did not feature in the Finals this year, the team won many admirers throughout the competition for their never-say-die attitude, contesting a number of close matches down to the wire. In years to come, 2013 will be remembered for a series of feats. As a roster, there were ten player milestones celebrated, a debut for NSW netballing \u201cTalent\u201d, and players rewarded with selection in Australian representative squads. NSW Swifts\u2019 athletes were named the game MVP on six occasions, and the Club retained the Sargeant-McKinnis Cup for a fourth straight season with a stirring nine-goal away victory over the [[Melbourne Vixens]]. The NSW Swifts also enjoyed record Membership in 2013, and the Club\u2019s Round 11 game against the [[Adelaide Thunderbirds]] at [[Allphones Arena]] saw a new NSW Swifts\u2019 regular season home crowd record of 8,021. 2013 will also be remembered as the season the Club celebrated the career and contribution of [[Vanessa Ware]], who after 107 games as a Swift decided to hang up the netball shoes at season\u2019s end. Mo\u2019onia Gerrard also announced she was taking a break from playing elite netball during the 2014 [[ANZ Championship]] to pursue her Olympic Rugby Sevens dream, but will remain part of the Club with a role in the restructured Swifts\u2019 coaching panel next season.\n\n'''2013 NSW Swifts Team:'''\nMo'onia Gerrard (Co-Captain), [[Kimberlee Green]] (Co-Captain), [[Susan Pettitt]] (Vice-Captain), [[Carla Dziwoki]], [[Paige Hadley]], [[April Letton]], [[Samantha May]], [[Sonia Mkoloma]], Melissa Tallent, [[Vanessa Ware]], [[Ashlee Weir]], [[Amorette Wild]].\n\n'''Coaching and Support Staff:'''\nHead Coach - Lisa Beehag, Assistant Coach - Rob Wright, Manager - Toni Kidwell, Physiotherapists - Brett Doring and Paula Peralta and Daniel Vukovic, Strength & Conditioning Coach - Damien Austin, Doctor - Dr Grace Bryant\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|+ Summary of 2013 player movements\n! width=300 | {{Gain}} Gains !! width=300 | {{Loss}} Losses\n|-\n| \n* [[Paige Hadley]] (2012 NSW Swifts Replacement Player)\n* Melissa Tallent\n* [[Ashlee Weir]] (Former NSW Swifts player)\n|\n* Kimberly Borger\n* Kristy Guthrie\n* Joanne Sutton (Retired)\n|}\n\nThe 2014 [[ANZ Championship]] season was another record-breaking year for the [[NSW Swifts]], both on and off the court.  From record Membership numbers to record crowd numbers, the Swifts also featured in the Finals Series for the first time since 2011.\n\nWe celebrated our highest Membership numbers to date with 1,676 signing up to cheer from the Red Zone, as well as setting a new [[ANZ Championship]] regular season crowd of 10,118 at [[Allphones Arena]] \u2013 smashing the previous record of 8,509.\n\nThe Club welcomed a new Head Coach \u2013 albeit a familiar face \u2013 in Rob Wright, as well as six new recruits in the playing roster, including three [[ANZ Championship]] debutants. The team faced many challenges at the beginning of their 2014 campaign, from developing new combinations to season-ending injuries.  But with skill and sheer determination, the Swifts finished the regular season in third place to host Waikato/Bay of Plenty Magic in the Minor Semi Final.\n\nThe roster\u2019s outstanding performances throughout the season were acknowledged with higher honours; four Swifts were selected in the 2014 Australian Diamonds squad, three athletes will represent Australia at the [[2014 Commonwealth Games]], with a further player named in the Australian 21/U squad, as well as league honours for [[Susan Pettitt]] and [[Kimberlee Green]] \u2013 voted into the 2014 FOXTEL [[ANZ Championship]] All-Star Team, and an ANZ Championship joint-Most Valuable Player nod for Green.\n\n'''2014 NSW Swifts Team:'''\n[[Kimberlee Green]] (Captain), [[Carla Dziwoki]], [[Paige Hadley]], Madeline Hay, [[Sharni Layton]], [[April Letton]], [[Abbey McCulloch]], [[Brooke Miller]], [[Sonia Mkoloma]], [[Susan Pettitt]], [[Gretel Tippett]], [[Caitlin Thwaites]], [[Sarah Wall]].\n\n'''Coaching and Support Staff:'''\nHead Coach - Rob Wright, Assistant Coach - [[Megan Anderson]], Technical Assistant Coach - Anita Keelan, Contracted Defensive Specialist Coach - Mo'onia Gerrard, Contacted Midcourt Specialist Coach - Megan Simpson, Apprentice Coaches - Briony Akle and Moira Gaha, Team Manager - Toni Kidwell, Performance Analyst - Bjorn Maddern, Physiotherapists - Paula Peralta and Brett Doring and Daniel Vukovic, Netball NSW Strength & Conditioning Coach - Jason Howell\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|+ Summary of 2014 player movements\n! width=300 | {{Gain}} Gains !! width=300 | {{Loss}} Losses\n|-\n| \n* Madeline Hay (New Recruit)\n* [[Sharni Layton]] (Thunderbirds)\n* [[Abbey McCulloch]] (Firebirds)\n* [[Brooke Miller]] (New Recruit)\n* [[Gretel Tippett]] (New Recruit)\n* [[Caitlin Thwaites]] (Pulse)\n* [[Sarah Wall]] (Permanent Replacement Player)\n|\n* Mo'onia Gerrard (Rugby Sevens)\n* [[Samantha May]] (Hertfordshire Mavericks)\n* Melissa Tallent\n* [[Vanessa Ware]]\n* [[Ashlee Weir]]\n* [[Amorette Wild]] (Firebirds)\n|}\n\n'''2015 NSW Swifts Team:'''\n[[Jade Clarke]], [[Julie Corletto]], [[Taylah Davies]], [[Kimberlee Green]], [[Paige Hadley]], [[Erin Hoare]], [[Sharni Layton]], [[Abbey McCulloch]], [[Susan Pettitt]], [[Caitlin Thwaites]], [[Micaela Wilson]], [[Stephanie Wood]]\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|+ Summary of 2015 player movements\n! width=400 | {{Gain}} Gains !! width=400 | {{Loss}} Losses\n|-\n| \n* [[Jade Clarke]] (Tactix)\n* [[Julie Corletto]] (Mystics)\n* [[Taylah Davies]] (2014 NSW Swifts Replacement Player)\n* [[Erin Hoare]] (Vixens)\n* [[Micaela Wilson]] (2014 NSW Swifts Replacement Player)\n* [[Stephanie Wood]]\n|\n* [[Carla Dziwoki]] (Vixens)\n* Madeline Hay\n* [[April Letton]] (Fever)\n* [[Brooke Miller]]\n* [[Sonia Mkoloma]]\n* [[Gretel Tippett]] (Firebirds)\n* [[Sarah Wall]]\n|}\n\n===Super Netball, 2017-present===\nThe Swifts entered the new [[Suncorp Super Netball]] league in 2017 with head coach Rob Wright, however the team struggled to compete against their newer, higher-ranked opponents who had poached several of their best players before the start of the competition.

In 1865 Barrias won the [[Prix de Rome]] for study at the [[French Academy in Rome]].\n\nBarrias was involved in the decoration of the [[Palais Garnier|Paris Op\u00e9ra]] and the [[H\u00f4tel de la Pa\u00efva]] in the [[Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]]. His work was mostly in marble, in a Romantic realist style indebted to [[Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux]].  \n\n==Biography==\nHe was born in [[Paris]] into a family of artists. His father was a [[porcelain-painter]], and his older brother [[F\u00e9lix-Joseph Barrias]] a well-known painter.  Louis-Ernest also started out as a painter, studying under [[L\u00e9on Cogniet]], but later took up sculpture with [[Pierre-Jules Cavelier]] as teacher. In 1858 he was admitted to the [[\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts]] in Paris, where his teacher was [[Fran\u00e7ois Jouffroy]]. In 1865 Barrias won the [[Prix de Rome]] for study at the [[French Academy in Rome]]. Barrias was involved in the decoration of the [[Palais Garnier|Paris Op\u00e9ra]] and the [[H\u00f4tel de la Pa\u00efva]] in the [[Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]]. His work was mostly in marble, in a Romantic realist style indebted to [[Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux]]. \n\nIn 1878 he was made a knight of the [[Legion of Honour]], an officer in 1881, and a commander in 1900. Barrias replaced Dumont at the [[Institut de France]] in 1884 then succeeded Cavelier as professor at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts. In 1900-03 he served on the Council for the National Museums. Among his students were [[Josep Clar\u00e0]], [[Charles Despiau]], [[Henri Bouchard]], and [[Victor S\u00e9goffin]].\n\nBarrias was very influenced by the [[Art Nouveau]] style, which was prominent in art during the fin-de-si\u00e8cle in France. The voluptuous women figures used in many of his sculptures are a product of this time and style. Nature and the erotic was, also, used often in this type style of art, which is seen in many of Barrias's works including, ''[[Nature Unveiling Herself Before Science]]''. This piece was made in 1899, when this style was popular. Another sculpture by Barrias is ''Portrait of the Young Mozart''. He also often used literary references in his sculptures (Fusco, Peter, and H. W, Janson, eds. ''The Romantics to Rodin''. New York: Los Angeles County Museum of Art, 1980.

The [[Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Milwaukee County]] Circuit Court has the greatest number of branches with 47.\n\nThe circuit courts are organized into 10 geographical administrative districts. Within each district the [[Wisconsin Supreme Court]] will appoint a chief judge, a deputy chief judge, and a professional district court administrator.<ref name=\"wicourts.gov\"/> With the exception of Milwaukee County, chief judges and their deputies continue to hear cases while serving. Chief judges assign judges to hear only a specific type of case (e.g. civil, criminal, juvenile), equalize the flow of cases, establish court policies and rules, and supervise the finances of the courts they administer. They also work closely with county boards on security, facility, and staffing issues. The chief judges and district court administration meet regularly with the director of state courts to discuss current issues and to advise the Supreme court and the director on matters of statewide concern.\n\nIn 2017, Wisconsin's Supreme Court created a new [[Business courts|Business Court]], the Commercial Docket Pilot Project,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wicourts.gov/services/attorney/comcourtpilot.htm|title=Wisconsin Court System - Commercial Docket Pilot Project|website=www.wicourts.gov|access-date=2019-04-06}}</ref> located in the Waukesha County Circuit Court and the Eighth Judicial Administrative District.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wisbar.org/NewsPublications/WisconsinLawyer/Pages/Article.aspx?Volume=91&Issue=1&ArticleID=26094|title=Solutions The Need for Speed: Commercial Court Open for Business|website=WisBar|language=en-us|access-date=2019-04-06}}</ref> On April 1, 2019, the Supreme Court expanded the Commercial Docket's geographic jurisdiction to encompass the entire state.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businesscourtsblog.com/wisconsin-expands-the-commercial-docket-pilot-project-to-all-wisconsin-counties/|title=Wisconsin Expands the Commercial Docket Pilot Project to All Wisconsin Counties \u2013 Business Courts Blog|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-06}}</ref>\n\n==Jurisdiction==\nThe Wisconsin circuit courts have original jurisdiction to hear all civil and criminal matters within the state. The court's jurisdiction is conferred by Article VII, Section 8 of the [[Wisconsin Constitution]] and is quite broad. Since the court's subject matter jurisdiction is constitutional rather than statutory, the [[Wisconsin Legislature]] cannot limit it by statute. By comparison, the [[United States Congress]] is empowered to limit the subject matter jurisdiction of federal [[United States district court|District Courts]] if it so chooses.\n\nThe geographic limitations of the circuit court's authority are referred to as \"[[personal jurisdiction]].\" In a [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] case, the requirements for personal jurisdiction are governed by chapter 801.05 of the Wisconsin Statutes. Generally speaking, a defendant must either be present in the state, or have sufficient contacts with the state, and the pleadings must have been properly served on the defendant. Personal jurisdiction requirements in a civil case are driven by policy considerations, such as fairness to the defendant, [[comity]], and principals of [[Federalism in the United States|federalism]].\n\nThe circuit court has personal jurisdiction over a defendant in a criminal case if the defendant violates a Wisconsin law while physically present in Wisconsin. Wisconsin courts also have personal jurisdiction over a defendant who commits an act while out of state that contributes to a crime, the consequences of which occur in Wisconsin.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wicourts.gov/forms1/circuit/index.htm|title=Wisconsin Court System - Circuit court forms|website=www.wicourts.gov}}</ref>\n\n<br />\n\n==Limits on exercise of power to decide cases==\nThere are, however, limits on what cases the circuit courts will hear.  They will not hear a case if the parties lack standing, or if the case is moot or is not ripe. Additionally, the circuit court will not hear a case in which it lacks competency. State law distinguishes between the court's jurisdiction (power to hear a case) and its competency (ability to arrive at a valid judgment in a case). A court lacks competency if certain statutory requirements are not satisfied, for example, time limits for filing suit, or requirements as to which circuit should decide a case.\n\nIn addition, the courts are constrained from taking action that will encroach on the powers of the legislative or executive branches. Under the separation of powers doctrine, no branch of government may exercise a power of government assigned exclusively to another branch. The purpose of separating powers among the branches of government is to avoid concentration of governmental power in the hands of a new and to give the various branches the ability to check actions by the other branches.\n\nIn reviewing the validity of state laws, the courts are limited to determining whether the law violates any provision of the constitution. The courts may invalidate a law that violates individual rights, such as the right to equal protection or due process, or a law that is not enacted according to the process established in the constitution, for example, a bill that was not passed by a majority of the members of each house of the [[Wisconsin State Legislature]]. However, a court may not invalidate a law because the court finds that the legislature's method for addressing a problem was not the most efficient. Nor may the court substitute its determination of what is in the public interest for the determination of the legislature.\n\nWhile the separation of powers doctrine limits the ability of the courts to act, it also protects the courts from encroachment by the legislature of governor. The Wisconsin Supreme Court established its judicial power in the three-branch system soon after Wisconsin became a state by deciding Bashford v. Barstow (1856), an election case that resulted in the ouster of an incumbent governor.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wicourts.gov/|title=Wisconsin Court System -|website=www.wicourts.gov}}</ref>\n\n==Commencing a civil case==\nCivil cases start the same way regardless of the issues or parties involved and regardless of whether the case ultimately goes to trial. A case begins with pleadings, in which the parties state basic claims and responses. The parties then have an opportunity to investigate the claims and gather evidence through a process called discovery. The court generally has little direct involvement in a case until shortly before trial, though the court is available to resolve preliminary matters and disputes.\n\n===Pleadings===\nThe [[plaintiff]] starts a civil case by filing a summons, and generally a complaint, with the clerk of circuit court and paying a filing fee. A summons provides the defendant notice that a suit has been filed against him or her and notifies the defendant that he or she must answer the complaint. The complaint sets forth the plaintiff's allegations against the defendant. It must contain a short and plain statement of the plaintiff's claim, identify the events out of which the claim arises, and demand relief to satisfy the plaintiff's claim. The plaintiff must serve an authenticated copy of the summons and complaint on the defendant. The favored method for serving the defendant is to personally hand a copy of the summons to him or her. Alternatively, the server may hand the summons to another responsible adult at the defendant's residence or, in some cases, it is sufficient for the plaintiff to publish the summons in a newspaper and send it to the defendant's address. Any adult who is not a party to the lawsuit may serve the summons. The person who serves the summons must sign the summons at the time of service and note the date, time, place, and manner of service and upon whom the summons is served. The plaintiff then files proof of service with the court.\n\nA plaintiff must commence a suit by serving the defendant with a summons within a certain time period established by a statute of limitation, or lose the right to sue. Statutes of limitation differ according to the type of suit. For example, a suit for breach of a sales contract must be commenced within six years; a suit for medical malpractice must be commenced within three years of the injury or within one year of discovery of the injury; and a suit to collect child support must be commenced within 20 years after the youngest child for whom support is due turns 18.\n\nThe defendant responds to the plaintiff's allegations in a document called an answer, in which the defendant must admit or deny an allegation or state that he or she does not know if the allegation is true, in which case the allegation is taken as denied. The defendant may also raise affirmative defenses (defenses that defeat the plaintiff's claims even if the plaintiff's allegations are true), for example, that the time period for filing the suit has expired, that the service of the summons and complaint was invalid, or that the complaint has already been settled in previous litigation. The defendant may also file a counterclaim against the plaintiff, or a cross-claim against a fellow defendant.\n\nThe complaint and the answer together constitute the \"pleadings\" in a case. The purpose of the pleadings is to provide notice of the claims and defenses. The issues of the case generally are not narrowed until later in the proceedings.\n\n===Discovery===\nAfter an action is commenced, the parties begin discovery, which is intended to provide the parties mutual knowledge of facts relevant to a case before trial so that the trial is limited to resolving disputed facts and issues. Discovery also allows the parties to formulate and narrow the issues for trial and obtain and preserve evidence. A recipient of a discovery request generally must provide the information or material requested unless it is readily available from another source or is privileged. The scope of permitted discovery in a civil case is quite broad. A party may use discovery to obtain material that will be inadmissible as evidence at trial as long as the material is reasonably calculated to lead to admissible evidence. Methods of discovery include depositions (recorded interviews with witnesses under oath), interrogatories (written questions), requests for production of documents or things, medical examinations, and requests for admissions.\n\nIdeally and usually, discovery takes place without direct involvement by the court. Except for medical examinations and inspection of medical records, discovery requests need not be authorized by the court. The recipient of a discovery request may seek a protective order denying certain discovery or limiting its scope if the discovery requested will cause annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense, or will inquire into privileged or irrelevant matters, and the party requesting discovery may request that the court intervene and order compliance.\n\n===Pretrial activities in court===\nAfter the pleadings are filed, the court may hold a scheduling conference with the parties and issue a scheduling order to manage the progress of the case. The scheduling order generally assigns dates for filing motions, amending pleadings, completing discovery, pretrial conferences between the judge and parties, and for trial. Some judges also use the scheduling conference to advise the parties to attempt to settle the case without going to trial.\n\nIn civil cases, parties often file a variety of pretrial motions with the court seeking court orders affecting the trial. For example, a defendant may seek dismissal of a whole case or certain issues in the case because the plaintiff has not stated a valid claim. Or, a party may seek an order compelling the opposing party to comply with a discovery request or a ruling on admissibility of certain pieces of evidence at trial. If the court requires additional information before ruling on a motion, the court may hold a hearing and may direct the parties to submit briefs, written materials that state the facts and present each side's position.\n\nThe courts resolve motions by order, often directing the prevailing party to prepare the order and submit it to the judge for his or her signature. The resolution of pretrial motions often dictates the future of a case. If a party wins a pretrial motion for summary judgment, the case is dismissed. Sometimes a party who loses important pretrial motions is more likely to agree to a settlement. A settlement must be accepted by a judge. Judges usually accept settlement agreements in civil cases with minimal review, although they look more closely at settlement agreements in divorce cases. If the parties do not settle, the case proceeds to trial.\n\n==Commencing a criminal case==\nOnly the state may bring a criminal case. Generally a prosecutor starts a criminal case by filing a complaint. The court is directly involved in a criminal case from the beginning to protect the rights of the defendant. Parties have a right to discovery in a criminal case, but discovery is not as extensive in a criminal case as in a civil case because the state must have completed most of its investigation before bringing criminal charges.\n\n===The criminal complaint===\nMost criminal cases are started when a prosecutor, either a [[district attorney]] (who represents a [[County (United States)|county]]) or the [[attorney general]] (who represents the state), files a complaint with the court. The complaint states the crime charged, names the defendant, and gives the date, approximate time, and location of the crime. In a complaint, the district attorney also presents sufficient facts to show why the defendant is being charged, identifies the source of the information contained in the complaint, and provides reasons why the source should be believed.\n\nProsecution of most crimes must be commenced within a certain time period that is established by a statute of limitation. The state generally has six years to commence prosecution of a felony (a crime for which a person may be sentenced to one year or more in prison) and three years for a misdemeanor (a crime for which the maximum penalty is a year in jail). However, there is no time limit for the prosecution of homicide. The main purpose of time limits is to ensure that criminal cases are tried while the evidence is still available and witnesses' memories are fresh. A case is commenced when a warrant, summons, or indictment is issued or an information is filed.\n\n===Pretrial court appearances===\nThe defendant's first court date is called the initial appearance. The court informs the defendant of the charges filed against him or her and gives the defendant a copy of the complaint. The court also informs the defendant of his or her right to have an attorney and that if the defendant is indigent and requests counsel, the court will appoint an attorney. If the defendant is in custody, the court determines whether to release the defendant on [[bail]], and if the defendant is released, imposes conditions for bail. In a misdemeanor case, the court may set the trial date at the initial appearance. The next court action in a misdemeanor case is the arraignment. Further steps are required in a felony case. At the initial appearance, the court informs a felony defendant that he or she is entitled to a preliminary examination before the criminal case may go forward.\n\nThe purpose of a preliminary examination is to determine in a felony case whether the district attorney can show probable cause to believe that the defendant committed a felony. If not, the court must dismiss the felony complaint. At the preliminary examination the district attorney and defendant may call witnesses and present evidence. If the court determines that the district attorney has shown probable cause or if the defendant waives his or her right to a preliminary examination, the case goes forward. The prosecutor files a pleading called an \"information,\" which informs the court of the crime with which the defendant is charged and states the date and place of the crime.\n\nAn arraignment is held in both misdemeanor and felony cases. At the arraignment, the complaint or information is read out loud unless the defendant waives reading, and in a felony case the district attorney gives the defendant a copy of the information. The court then asks the defendant to submit a plea. The defendant may plead \"guilty\", \"no contest\", \"not guilty\", or \"not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect\". A plea of no contest has the same effect in a criminal case as a guilty plea, except it cannot be used as an admission of criminal action in a civil case. The defendant may not enter a plea of no contest without approval from the court. If the defendant pleads guilty or no contest, the court sentences the defendant or places the defendant on probation. If the defendant pleads not guilty or not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect, the case proceeds to trial.\n\n==Grand jury and John Doe proceedings==\nAlthough the vast majority of criminal cases in Wisconsin are begun by a district attorney filing a criminal complaint, some cases are commenced as the result of a [[grand jury]] or [[John Doe]] investigation. Grand jury and John Doe investigations are secret proceedings for which witnesses may be subpoenaed. Grand jury and John Doe proceedings are generally used when investigators need to take testimony under oath or compel a witness to testify in order to gather sufficient evidence to issue a criminal complaint.\n\nA judge, usually upon the request of a district attorney, may assemble a grand jury to investigate suspected criminal activity. A grand jury consists of 17 people selected for jury service. The grand jury may request that the prosecutor [[subpoena]] and examine witnesses. Upon completing an investigation, a grand jury may by the vote of at least 14 members return an indictment, which is a written accusation that a person committed a crime. If the grand jury returns an indictment, the court issues a summons or warrant for the defendant.\n\nA judge initiates a John Doe proceeding upon receiving a complaint about criminal activity from any person, including the district attorney. The judge must question the person who makes the complaint under oath and may subpoena and examine other witnesses (usually with the assistance of the district attorney). If the judge finds probable cause to believe that a person has committed a crime, a written complaint is filed and the judge issues a warrant for the arrest of the defendant named in the complaint.\n\n===Discovery===\nDiscovery in a criminal case is generally less extensive than in a civil case. Discovery allows the parties to obtain certain information known by the opposing party. Upon request, the prosecution and defense must provide a list of witnesses it intends to call at trial, as well as statements of the witnesses, reports of expert witnesses, and any known criminal record of a witness. The parties must also disclose any physical evidence they intend to introduce at trial. A party may obtain a court order allowing scientific testing of evidence held by the opposing party. The prosecution must disclose statements made by the defendant that pertain to the crime or that the prosecution intends to introduce at trial. The prosecution is obligated to disclose exculpatory evidence (evidence that might weigh in the defendant's favor) to the defendant even if the defendant does not specifically request the information or material.\n\n===Pretrial motions and plea bargains===\nParties in a criminal case often file [[pretrial motion]]s. Common motions include motions to exclude physical evidence, a defendant's confession, or an [[eyewitness identification]] of the defendant. The court may require the attorneys to submit briefs on the motions, but briefing is less common on pretrial motions in criminal cases than civil cases.\n\nMost criminal cases do not go to trial. Instead the prosecution and defense negotiate a settlement. The parties may agree upon the crimes to which a defendant will plead guilty and a sentence recommendation, or may only agree on the plea. The judge must review the agreement on the plea before accepting it to ensure that there is sufficient reason to believe that the defendant is guilty of the crime. If the parties agree on a sentence recommendation, the judge must review it to determine if it is appropriate. The judge is not bound by the sentence agreement.\n\n==Trial of a civil or criminal case==\nThe proceedings in a trial of a civil or criminal case are similar. Both may be to a jury or judge. Both start with opening statements, proceed to presentation of evidence followed by closing statements, and culminate with a decision. Depending on the result of the trial, a civil case may end with the awarding of damages and a criminal trial may end with sentencing. During the trial, the role of the judge is similar \u2013 determining the admissibility of evidence, guiding the jury, if there is one, and refereeing the actions of the attorneys.\n\n==Current Judges==\n\nCircuit judges are elected to a six year term in the spring non-partisan election, currently Wisconsin holds a non-partisan primary election in February and a general election in April.  New judicial terms start on the first day of August in the year of the election.\n\nIn the event of a vacancy, the Governor can appoint an interim judge to hold office until the next spring election.\n\n===District 1===\n\n*'''Counties:''' [[Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]]\n*'''Court:''' [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]]\n*'''Chief Judge:''' Mary Triggiano \n*'''Court Administrator:''' Holly Szablewski<ref name=\"bb2019\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Circuit\n!Branch\n!Judge\n!Entered office\n!Next election\n!Notes\n|-\n! rowspan=\"47\"| [[Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]]\n| 1\n| Jack D\u00e1vila\n| align=\"center\" | 2020\n| align=\"center\" | 2021\n| ''Appointed by [[Tony Evers]]''<ref name=\"evers\">{{cite news| url= https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2020/04/09/jack-davila-named-circuit-judge-milwaukee-county/5126764002/ |title= Gov.

There are currently 69 circuits in the state, divided into 10 judicial administrative districts. Circuit court judges hear and decide both civil and criminal cases. Each of the 249 circuit court judges are elected and serve six-year terms.<ref name=\"bb2019\">{{cite report| url= https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/misc/lrb/blue_book/2019_2020 |title= Wisconsin Blue Book 2019-2020 |year= 2019|publisher= State of Wisconsin |location= [[Madison, Wisconsin]] |chapter= The Judiciary |pages= 268-271 |accessdate= January 1, 2020}}</ref>  \n\nOn March 6, 2020, Governor [[Tony Evers]] signed bipartisan legislation to create 12 new circuit court branches to be elected in spring 2021 and take office in fall 2021.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/tony-evers-signs-bill-adding-circuit-court-branches/article_f8fcfe31-c419-5ef3-8da2-29a1c7f84750.html|title= Tony Evers signs bill adding 12 circuit court branches  |newspaper= [[Wisconsin State Journal]] |first= Riley |last= Vetterkind |date= March 6, 2020 |accessdate= March 6, 2020 }}</ref>\n\n==Structure of the circuit courts==\nThe circuit court system is composed of 69 circuits, with 66 circuits serving a single county, and three circuits serving two counties each.<ref name=\"wicourts.gov\">{{cite web|url=https://wicourts.gov/courts/circuit/index.htm|title=Wisconsin Court System - Circuit courts|website=wicourts.gov}}</ref> [[Buffalo County, Wisconsin|Buffalo]] and [[Pepin County, Wisconsin|Pepin]]<nowiki/> counties share a circuit, as do [[Florence County, Wisconsin|Florence]] and [[Forest County, Wisconsin|Forest]] counties, and [[Shawano County, Wisconsin|Shawano]] and [[Menominee County, Wisconsin|Menominee]] counties.<ref name=\"wicourts.gov\"/> 26 circuit courts are served by a single judge.<ref name=\"wicourts.gov\"/> For those circuits with more than one judge, each is elected to a particular seat, or \"branch\" within the court. The [[Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Milwaukee County]] Circuit Court has the greatest number of branches with 47.\n\nThe circuit courts are organized into 10 geographical administrative districts. Within each district the [[Wisconsin Supreme Court]] will appoint a chief judge, a deputy chief judge, and a professional district court administrator.<ref name=\"wicourts.gov\"/> With the exception of Milwaukee County, chief judges and their deputies continue to hear cases while serving. Chief judges assign judges to hear only a specific type of case (e.g. civil, criminal, juvenile), equalize the flow of cases, establish court policies and rules, and supervise the finances of the courts they administer. They also work closely with county boards on security, facility, and staffing issues. The chief judges and district court administration meet regularly with the director of state courts to discuss current issues and to advise the Supreme court and the director on matters of statewide concern.\n\nIn 2017, Wisconsin's Supreme Court created a new [[Business courts|Business Court]], the Commercial Docket Pilot Project,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wicourts.gov/services/attorney/comcourtpilot.htm|title=Wisconsin Court System - Commercial Docket Pilot Project|website=www.wicourts.gov|access-date=2019-04-06}}</ref> located in the Waukesha County Circuit Court and the Eighth Judicial Administrative District.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wisbar.org/NewsPublications/WisconsinLawyer/Pages/Article.aspx?Volume=91&Issue=1&ArticleID=26094|title=Solutions The Need for Speed: Commercial Court Open for Business|website=WisBar|language=en-us|access-date=2019-04-06}}</ref> On April 1, 2019, the Supreme Court expanded the Commercial Docket's geographic jurisdiction to encompass the entire state.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businesscourtsblog.com/wisconsin-expands-the-commercial-docket-pilot-project-to-all-wisconsin-counties/|title=Wisconsin Expands the Commercial Docket Pilot Project to All Wisconsin Counties \u2013 Business Courts Blog|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-06}}</ref>\n\n==Jurisdiction==\nThe Wisconsin circuit courts have original jurisdiction to hear all civil and criminal matters within the state. The court's jurisdiction is conferred by Article VII, Section 8 of the [[Wisconsin Constitution]] and is quite broad. Since the court's subject matter jurisdiction is constitutional rather than statutory, the [[Wisconsin Legislature]] cannot limit it by statute. By comparison, the [[United States Congress]] is empowered to limit the subject matter jurisdiction of federal [[United States district court|District Courts]] if it so chooses.\n\nThe geographic limitations of the circuit court's authority are referred to as \"[[personal jurisdiction]].\" In a [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] case, the requirements for personal jurisdiction are governed by chapter 801.05 of the Wisconsin Statutes. Generally speaking, a defendant must either be present in the state, or have sufficient contacts with the state, and the pleadings must have been properly served on the defendant. Personal jurisdiction requirements in a civil case are driven by policy considerations, such as fairness to the defendant, [[comity]], and principals of [[Federalism in the United States|federalism]].\n\nThe circuit court has personal jurisdiction over a defendant in a criminal case if the defendant violates a Wisconsin law while physically present in Wisconsin. Wisconsin courts also have personal jurisdiction over a defendant who commits an act while out of state that contributes to a crime, the consequences of which occur in Wisconsin.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wicourts.gov/forms1/circuit/index.htm|title=Wisconsin Court System - Circuit court forms|website=www.wicourts.gov}}</ref>\n\n<br />\n\n==Limits on exercise of power to decide cases==\nThere are, however, limits on what cases the circuit courts will hear.  They will not hear a case if the parties lack standing, or if the case is moot or is not ripe. Additionally, the circuit court will not hear a case in which it lacks competency. State law distinguishes between the court's jurisdiction (power to hear a case) and its competency (ability to arrive at a valid judgment in a case). A court lacks competency if certain statutory requirements are not satisfied, for example, time limits for filing suit, or requirements as to which circuit should decide a case.\n\nIn addition, the courts are constrained from taking action that will encroach on the powers of the legislative or executive branches. Under the separation of powers doctrine, no branch of government may exercise a power of government assigned exclusively to another branch. The purpose of separating powers among the branches of government is to avoid concentration of governmental power in the hands of a new and to give the various branches the ability to check actions by the other branches.\n\nIn reviewing the validity of state laws, the courts are limited to determining whether the law violates any provision of the constitution. The courts may invalidate a law that violates individual rights, such as the right to equal protection or due process, or a law that is not enacted according to the process established in the constitution, for example, a bill that was not passed by a majority of the members of each house of the [[Wisconsin State Legislature]]. However, a court may not invalidate a law because the court finds that the legislature's method for addressing a problem was not the most efficient. Nor may the court substitute its determination of what is in the public interest for the determination of the legislature.\n\nWhile the separation of powers doctrine limits the ability of the courts to act, it also protects the courts from encroachment by the legislature of governor. The Wisconsin Supreme Court established its judicial power in the three-branch system soon after Wisconsin became a state by deciding Bashford v. Barstow (1856), an election case that resulted in the ouster of an incumbent governor.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wicourts.gov/|title=Wisconsin Court System -|website=www.wicourts.gov}}</ref>\n\n==Commencing a civil case==\nCivil cases start the same way regardless of the issues or parties involved and regardless of whether the case ultimately goes to trial. A case begins with pleadings, in which the parties state basic claims and responses. The parties then have an opportunity to investigate the claims and gather evidence through a process called discovery. The court generally has little direct involvement in a case until shortly before trial, though the court is available to resolve preliminary matters and disputes.\n\n===Pleadings===\nThe [[plaintiff]] starts a civil case by filing a summons, and generally a complaint, with the clerk of circuit court and paying a filing fee. A summons provides the defendant notice that a suit has been filed against him or her and notifies the defendant that he or she must answer the complaint. The complaint sets forth the plaintiff's allegations against the defendant. It must contain a short and plain statement of the plaintiff's claim, identify the events out of which the claim arises, and demand relief to satisfy the plaintiff's claim. The plaintiff must serve an authenticated copy of the summons and complaint on the defendant. The favored method for serving the defendant is to personally hand a copy of the summons to him or her. Alternatively, the server may hand the summons to another responsible adult at the defendant's residence or, in some cases, it is sufficient for the plaintiff to publish the summons in a newspaper and send it to the defendant's address. Any adult who is not a party to the lawsuit may serve the summons. The person who serves the summons must sign the summons at the time of service and note the date, time, place, and manner of service and upon whom the summons is served. The plaintiff then files proof of service with the court.\n\nA plaintiff must commence a suit by serving the defendant with a summons within a certain time period established by a statute of limitation, or lose the right to sue. Statutes of limitation differ according to the type of suit. For example, a suit for breach of a sales contract must be commenced within six years; a suit for medical malpractice must be commenced within three years of the injury or within one year of discovery of the injury; and a suit to collect child support must be commenced within 20 years after the youngest child for whom support is due turns 18.\n\nThe defendant responds to the plaintiff's allegations in a document called an answer, in which the defendant must admit or deny an allegation or state that he or she does not know if the allegation is true, in which case the allegation is taken as denied. The defendant may also raise affirmative defenses (defenses that defeat the plaintiff's claims even if the plaintiff's allegations are true), for example, that the time period for filing the suit has expired, that the service of the summons and complaint was invalid, or that the complaint has already been settled in previous litigation. The defendant may also file a counterclaim against the plaintiff, or a cross-claim against a fellow defendant.\n\nThe complaint and the answer together constitute the \"pleadings\" in a case. The purpose of the pleadings is to provide notice of the claims and defenses. The issues of the case generally are not narrowed until later in the proceedings.\n\n===Discovery===\nAfter an action is commenced, the parties begin discovery, which is intended to provide the parties mutual knowledge of facts relevant to a case before trial so that the trial is limited to resolving disputed facts and issues. Discovery also allows the parties to formulate and narrow the issues for trial and obtain and preserve evidence. A recipient of a discovery request generally must provide the information or material requested unless it is readily available from another source or is privileged. The scope of permitted discovery in a civil case is quite broad. A party may use discovery to obtain material that will be inadmissible as evidence at trial as long as the material is reasonably calculated to lead to admissible evidence. Methods of discovery include depositions (recorded interviews with witnesses under oath), interrogatories (written questions), requests for production of documents or things, medical examinations, and requests for admissions.\n\nIdeally and usually, discovery takes place without direct involvement by the court. Except for medical examinations and inspection of medical records, discovery requests need not be authorized by the court. The recipient of a discovery request may seek a protective order denying certain discovery or limiting its scope if the discovery requested will cause annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense, or will inquire into privileged or irrelevant matters, and the party requesting discovery may request that the court intervene and order compliance.\n\n===Pretrial activities in court===\nAfter the pleadings are filed, the court may hold a scheduling conference with the parties and issue a scheduling order to manage the progress of the case. The scheduling order generally assigns dates for filing motions, amending pleadings, completing discovery, pretrial conferences between the judge and parties, and for trial. Some judges also use the scheduling conference to advise the parties to attempt to settle the case without going to trial.\n\nIn civil cases, parties often file a variety of pretrial motions with the court seeking court orders affecting the trial. For example, a defendant may seek dismissal of a whole case or certain issues in the case because the plaintiff has not stated a valid claim. Or, a party may seek an order compelling the opposing party to comply with a discovery request or a ruling on admissibility of certain pieces of evidence at trial. If the court requires additional information before ruling on a motion, the court may hold a hearing and may direct the parties to submit briefs, written materials that state the facts and present each side's position.\n\nThe courts resolve motions by order, often directing the prevailing party to prepare the order and submit it to the judge for his or her signature. The resolution of pretrial motions often dictates the future of a case. If a party wins a pretrial motion for summary judgment, the case is dismissed. Sometimes a party who loses important pretrial motions is more likely to agree to a settlement. A settlement must be accepted by a judge. Judges usually accept settlement agreements in civil cases with minimal review, although they look more closely at settlement agreements in divorce cases. If the parties do not settle, the case proceeds to trial.\n\n==Commencing a criminal case==\nOnly the state may bring a criminal case. Generally a prosecutor starts a criminal case by filing a complaint. The court is directly involved in a criminal case from the beginning to protect the rights of the defendant. Parties have a right to discovery in a criminal case, but discovery is not as extensive in a criminal case as in a civil case because the state must have completed most of its investigation before bringing criminal charges.\n\n===The criminal complaint===\nMost criminal cases are started when a prosecutor, either a [[district attorney]] (who represents a [[County (United States)|county]]) or the [[attorney general]] (who represents the state), files a complaint with the court. The complaint states the crime charged, names the defendant, and gives the date, approximate time, and location of the crime. In a complaint, the district attorney also presents sufficient facts to show why the defendant is being charged, identifies the source of the information contained in the complaint, and provides reasons why the source should be believed.\n\nProsecution of most crimes must be commenced within a certain time period that is established by a statute of limitation. The state generally has six years to commence prosecution of a felony (a crime for which a person may be sentenced to one year or more in prison) and three years for a misdemeanor (a crime for which the maximum penalty is a year in jail). However, there is no time limit for the prosecution of homicide. The main purpose of time limits is to ensure that criminal cases are tried while the evidence is still available and witnesses' memories are fresh. A case is commenced when a warrant, summons, or indictment is issued or an information is filed.\n\n===Pretrial court appearances===\nThe defendant's first court date is called the initial appearance. The court informs the defendant of the charges filed against him or her and gives the defendant a copy of the complaint. The court also informs the defendant of his or her right to have an attorney and that if the defendant is indigent and requests counsel, the court will appoint an attorney. If the defendant is in custody, the court determines whether to release the defendant on [[bail]], and if the defendant is released, imposes conditions for bail. In a misdemeanor case, the court may set the trial date at the initial appearance. The next court action in a misdemeanor case is the arraignment. Further steps are required in a felony case. At the initial appearance, the court informs a felony defendant that he or she is entitled to a preliminary examination before the criminal case may go forward.\n\nThe purpose of a preliminary examination is to determine in a felony case whether the district attorney can show probable cause to believe that the defendant committed a felony. If not, the court must dismiss the felony complaint. At the preliminary examination the district attorney and defendant may call witnesses and present evidence. If the court determines that the district attorney has shown probable cause or if the defendant waives his or her right to a preliminary examination, the case goes forward. The prosecutor files a pleading called an \"information,\" which informs the court of the crime with which the defendant is charged and states the date and place of the crime.\n\nAn arraignment is held in both misdemeanor and felony cases. At the arraignment, the complaint or information is read out loud unless the defendant waives reading, and in a felony case the district attorney gives the defendant a copy of the information. The court then asks the defendant to submit a plea. The defendant may plead \"guilty\", \"no contest\", \"not guilty\", or \"not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect\". A plea of no contest has the same effect in a criminal case as a guilty plea, except it cannot be used as an admission of criminal action in a civil case. The defendant may not enter a plea of no contest without approval from the court. If the defendant pleads guilty or no contest, the court sentences the defendant or places the defendant on probation. If the defendant pleads not guilty or not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect, the case proceeds to trial.\n\n==Grand jury and John Doe proceedings==\nAlthough the vast majority of criminal cases in Wisconsin are begun by a district attorney filing a criminal complaint, some cases are commenced as the result of a [[grand jury]] or [[John Doe]] investigation. Grand jury and John Doe investigations are secret proceedings for which witnesses may be subpoenaed. Grand jury and John Doe proceedings are generally used when investigators need to take testimony under oath or compel a witness to testify in order to gather sufficient evidence to issue a criminal complaint.\n\nA judge, usually upon the request of a district attorney, may assemble a grand jury to investigate suspected criminal activity. A grand jury consists of 17 people selected for jury service. The grand jury may request that the prosecutor [[subpoena]] and examine witnesses. Upon completing an investigation, a grand jury may by the vote of at least 14 members return an indictment, which is a written accusation that a person committed a crime. If the grand jury returns an indictment, the court issues a summons or warrant for the defendant.\n\nA judge initiates a John Doe proceeding upon receiving a complaint about criminal activity from any person, including the district attorney. The judge must question the person who makes the complaint under oath and may subpoena and examine other witnesses (usually with the assistance of the district attorney). If the judge finds probable cause to believe that a person has committed a crime, a written complaint is filed and the judge issues a warrant for the arrest of the defendant named in the complaint.\n\n===Discovery===\nDiscovery in a criminal case is generally less extensive than in a civil case. Discovery allows the parties to obtain certain information known by the opposing party. Upon request, the prosecution and defense must provide a list of witnesses it intends to call at trial, as well as statements of the witnesses, reports of expert witnesses, and any known criminal record of a witness. The parties must also disclose any physical evidence they intend to introduce at trial. A party may obtain a court order allowing scientific testing of evidence held by the opposing party. The prosecution must disclose statements made by the defendant that pertain to the crime or that the prosecution intends to introduce at trial. The prosecution is obligated to disclose exculpatory evidence (evidence that might weigh in the defendant's favor) to the defendant even if the defendant does not specifically request the information or material.\n\n===Pretrial motions and plea bargains===\nParties in a criminal case often file [[pretrial motion]]s. Common motions include motions to exclude physical evidence, a defendant's confession, or an [[eyewitness identification]] of the defendant. The court may require the attorneys to submit briefs on the motions, but briefing is less common on pretrial motions in criminal cases than civil cases.\n\nMost criminal cases do not go to trial. Instead the prosecution and defense negotiate a settlement. The parties may agree upon the crimes to which a defendant will plead guilty and a sentence recommendation, or may only agree on the plea. The judge must review the agreement on the plea before accepting it to ensure that there is sufficient reason to believe that the defendant is guilty of the crime. If the parties agree on a sentence recommendation, the judge must review it to determine if it is appropriate. The judge is not bound by the sentence agreement.\n\n==Trial of a civil or criminal case==\nThe proceedings in a trial of a civil or criminal case are similar. Both may be to a jury or judge. Both start with opening statements, proceed to presentation of evidence followed by closing statements, and culminate with a decision. Depending on the result of the trial, a civil case may end with the awarding of damages and a criminal trial may end with sentencing. During the trial, the role of the judge is similar \u2013 determining the admissibility of evidence, guiding the jury, if there is one, and refereeing the actions of the attorneys.\n\n==Current Judges==\n\nCircuit judges are elected to a six year term in the spring non-partisan election, currently Wisconsin holds a non-partisan primary election in February and a general election in April.  New judicial terms start on the first day of August in the year of the election.\n\nIn the event of a vacancy, the Governor can appoint an interim judge to hold office until the next spring election.\n\n===District 1===\n\n*'''Counties:''' [[Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]]\n*'''Court:''' [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]]\n*'''Chief Judge:''' Mary Triggiano \n*'''Court Administrator:''' Holly Szablewski<ref name=\"bb2019\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Circuit\n!Branch\n!Judge\n!Entered office\n!Next election\n!Notes\n|-\n! rowspan=\"47\"| [[Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]]\n| 1\n| Jack D\u00e1vila\n| align=\"center\" | 2020\n| align=\"center\" | 2021\n| ''Appointed by [[Tony Evers]]''<ref name=\"evers\">{{cite news| url= https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2020/04/09/jack-davila-named-circuit-judge-milwaukee-county/5126764002/ |title= Gov.

As a \"special\" game-day exclusive, it broadcasts on Sundays during the [[National Football League regular season|NFL regular season]] from 1:00&nbsp;p.m. to 8:00&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]] (10:00&nbsp;a.m. to 5:00&nbsp;p.m. [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific]]), or when the last afternoon window game ends. ''RedZone'' provides \"whip around\" [[simulcast]] coverage of all Sunday afternoon games airing in-progress on [[NFL on CBS|CBS]] and [[NFL on Fox|Fox]].\n\n''RedZone'' is based out of the [[NFL Network]] studios and is hosted by [[Scott Hanson]],<ref name=\"TripInside\">{{cite news|url=http://grantland.com/features/watching-day-nfl-games-redzone-studio/|title=A Trip Inside the RedZone|publisher=Grantland|first=Rembert|last=Brown|date=November 15, 2012|accessdate=September 3, 2014}}</ref> and airs commercial-free. The channel prides itself on showing \"every touchdown from every game,\" and is closely linked to [[Fantasy football (American)|Fantasy Football]],<ref name=\"TripInside\"/> reporting superlatives and tracking various statistical accomplishments throughout the afternoon. ''RedZone'' monitors coverage of the traditional Sunday afternoon 1:00&nbsp;p.m. \"early\" games and 4:05/4:25&nbsp;p.m. \"late\" games.\n\n''RedZone'' is offered by numerous cable providers, [[Dish Network]], and [[Verizon Wireless]] [[smartphone]]s, but specifically is not available on [[DirecTV]], which offers its own version (''[[NFL Sunday Ticket#Extra features|Red Zone Channel]]'' hosted by [[Andrew Siciliano]]) as part of [[NFL Sunday Ticket]].\n\n''[[ESPN Goal Line]]'', a channel which debuted one year later, broadcasts [[college football]] with a similar format and style. The name \"RedZone\" derives from the term [[Red zone (gridiron football)|red zone]], which is the part of the football field between the 20-yard line and the goal line.\n\n==Format==\nOn game day, the ''RedZone'' channel [[Sign-on|signs-on]] at 12:55&nbsp;p.m., or five minutes prior to 1:00&nbsp;p.m., US Eastern time. The countdown clock counts down the minutes and seconds until the start of the game coverage. \n\n===Whip around coverage===\nAt 1:00&nbsp;p.m. (Eastern) the ''RedZone'' program begins, and immediately dives into live look-ins across the league. Host [[Scott Hanson]] gives a brief introduction of the day, highlighting key developing stories, as teams are typically already lining up for opening kickoff. When the first kickoff takes place, Hanson will say \"Seven hours of commercial-free football... starts now!\" Coverage of the opening kickoffs and a cursory look at early drives that are being established are the initial focus. Coverage is normally shown in full-screen, with one particular game as the primary focus for the moment. The coverage is a direct simulcast of the [[NFL on CBS|CBS]] or [[NFL on Fox|Fox]] broadcast feed and commentary, with only occasional and usually brief voice-over comments by Hanson as needed. Coverage sometimes switches to [[Split screen (filmmaking)|split-screen]], with two, three, four (\"quad-box\"<ref name=\"TripInside\"/>), five (\"Penta-box\"), or as many as eight (\"Octo-box\"<ref name=\"TripInside\"/>) game feeds being shown simultaneously. Producers in the studio monitor all game feeds in-progress, and decide which game to feature at any given moment. [[National Football League on television|NFL television rules]] are exempted for ''RedZone'', and live look-ins of games that are subject to [[National Football League television blackout policies|blackout]] are still allowed to be aired in all markets.\n\nWhenever a team enters the [[Red zone (gridiron football)|red zone]], the coverage will switch to a full-screen live look-in of that game's television broadcast. It will attempt to cover a potential scoring result (touchdown or field goal). Meanwhile, the other games continue to be monitored, in case the need arises to switch to another feed at short notice. Field goal attempts from outside the red zone are sometimes shown, either live or in replay, if they pose significance to the outcome of the respective game.\n\nAs the games enter halftime, the coverage shifts over to games still finishing up the second quarter, even if there are no teams in the red zone. Some noncompetitive games that would otherwise not be looked at may take the attention for a few minutes, in order to fill the broadcast with as much live football coverage as possible. As soon as better games start returning for the third quarter, second half kickoffs typically take a priority. \n\nIf there are no teams in the red zone at a given moment, the focus may shift to a team on a strong offensive drive, or an otherwise important game of the day. Despite the channel's moniker, a team does not have to be inside the [[Red zone (gridiron football)|red zone]] for the focus and coverage to shift to that game. During the latter portion of the season, extra sidebar attention may be given to teams fighting for playoff berths, and the respective status thereof. The \"whip around\" coverage also is used to show quick replays of major plays such as turnovers, deep pass completions, very long runs from scrimmage, kickoff/punt return touchdowns, and other potentially interesting or important key plays. The \"Game Rewind\" feature is sometimes used to replay a significant play that resulted in a particular team entering the red zone.\n\nHanson rarely takes any kind of rest break during RedZone's seven hours on the air<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/12/14/370379435/seven-chaotic-hours-behind-the-scenes-at-nfl-redzone|title=7 Chaotic Hours Behind The Scenes At NFL RedZone|last=Sullivan|first=Becky|date=14 December 2014|work=[[NPR]]|accessdate=12 March 2018}}</ref>, and since the early years of the channel he has purposefully planned out his eating and drinking schedule during the regular season to avoid any need for a [[Public toilet|restroom]] break, having boasted on Twitter on December 10, 2017 (that year's Week 14) about his first restroom break in four years of NFL RedZone coverage.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ftw/2017/12/10/nfl-redzone-host-admits-he-took-his-first-bathroom-break-in-four-years/108497432/|title=RedZone host takes first bathroom break in 4 years|last=Joseph|first=Andrew|date=10 December 2017|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=12 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nIt is not unusual for ''RedZone'' to switch between two or more games in quick succession, even between individual plays. Despite an effort made by producers to air all touchdowns [[Live television|live]], some scoring plays are actually aired after a very brief [[Time shifting|time shift]] \u2013 ranging from as much as 30 to 60 seconds \u2013 sometimes because another scoring play is unfolding elsewhere. Time shifting can also occur if the scoring play happened unexpectedly, and/or initiated from outside the red zone. In those cases, the coverage is aired plausibly live with no mention that the coverage is slightly behind real time (though Hanson often tries to introduce the switch with some kind of segue, such as 'while we were watching that (play)...' to note it isn't live video). As the 1 p.m. \"early\" games begin to conclude, ''RedZone'' seamlessly leads into coverage of the 4:05/4:25&nbsp;p.m. \"late\" games, though on afternoons where all early game action has ended, extended statistical rundowns and check-ins on team press conferences may occur to fill the time before those late games start. When the \"early\" games are in the fourth quarter, attention begins to focus on ''one-possession'' games (games within 8 points). Likewise, early games that go into overtime are usually prioritized, but neither at the expense of missing touchdowns in other games that just started.\n\nAs the 4&nbsp;p.m. \"late\" games begin to arrive at their conclusions, coverage will likewise narrow down to the remaining games still ongoing. At which time there is only one game left being played, coverage will switch to full-screen and see out its conclusion, irrespective of its competitiveness. When each game is concluded, a final score alert will flash on the bottom corner of the screen to inform viewers. This is especially important for games that have not had a live look-in for many minutes.\n\nPeriodically throughout the afternoon, producers keep track of and update viewers on the status of [[Fantasy football (American)|fantasy football]] statistics, and/or other statistical superlatives.<ref name=\"TripInside\"/> The channel's priority, however, is to show every touchdown scored in every game throughout the afternoon. During the entire day, ''RedZone'' features a [[News ticker|ticker]] at the bottom of the screen, updating scores and stats throughout the league. The ticker is situated in such a way that it is superimposed over the respective tickers of CBS and [[FoxBox (sports)|FOX]].\n\nOn occasion, technical difficulties could prevent RedZone from showing certain touchdowns live. During Week 1 in the 2019 season, a technical issue with the CBS broadcast prevented a live look at a touchdown in the [[Kansas City Chiefs]]-[[Jacksonville Jaguars]] game; the touchdown was later shown using video from the scoreboard at [[TIAA Bank Field]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2019/09/08/nfl-cbs-drops-chiefs-jaguars-broadcast-over-technical-issues/2258032001/|title=CBS drops Chiefs-Jaguars broadcast in fourth quarter due to technical difficulties|last=Reyes|first=Lorenzo|website=USA TODAY|language=en|access-date=2019-09-15}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/videos/every-td-every-game/0ap3000001052767/Every-TD-from-Every-Game-Week-1|title=Every TD from Every Game {{!}} Week 1|website=NFL.com|language=en|access-date=2019-09-15}}</ref>\n\n===Commercial-free format===\n''RedZone'' operates as a commercial-free service; as such, whenever a game taking primary focus goes to a broadcaster-designated commercial break or other stoppage (such as timeout, instant replay challenge or an injury timeout), the feed will immediately switch to the next most-interesting game in-progress at the moment. Despite the network's commercial-free commitment, commercials are not completely avoided as sometimes the network coverage may take a break faster than expected, causing the first second or two of a commercial to air, before RedZone quickly cuts to another game, which usually includes Hanson jokingly playing off the brush with the accompanying commercial with some kind of snark. Additionally, broadcast network promotions of their programming (most notably CBS and Fox promoting their Sunday night primetime lineups) will be shown as a natural part of the coverage.\n\nIf all games being held at a given moment are on a commercial break or in halftime, coverage will revert to the studio for brief commentary, replays, or statistical analysis by Hanson. In the \"late\" timeslot (when there are fewer games to choose from), highlight packages of selected \"early\" games may be shown during down times.\n\n===Touchdown montage and sign-off===\nThe network's broadcast day ends when the final Sunday afternoon game concludes, or at 8:00&nbsp;p.m. (Eastern). At the conclusion of the coverage, an edited [[Montage (filmmaking)|montage]] of every touchdown scored throughout the afternoon is aired. Until 2018, due to contractual obligations, ''RedZone'' was required to [[sign-off]] no later than 8:00&nbsp;p.m., even if a late afternoon game(s) was still in progress; this was rectified in the 2019 season, and any game that ends after 8:00&nbsp;p.m. will continue airing on ''RedZone'' until its conclusion. If the ''RedZone'' signs-off with inadequate time for the touchdown montage (which can vary from 5\u201310 minutes in duration), it will be posted online instead. At the onset, the total number of touchdowns for the afternoon by type (offensive, defensive, and special teams) is listed on a graphic, with a running tally for the entire season also shown.\n\nIn some cases, when games are running close to the 8:00&nbsp;p.m. deadline, the touchdown montage has been shown in a [[Split screen (video production)|split-screen]] format. The montage is shown in a prominent square with audio, while the game still being played is shown in a lesser square in the corner of the screen without audio. This is done particularly when the game still being played is a nationally-televised game \u2013 a situation in which most viewers in most markets across the country (per NFL television rules) could simply switch to CBS or FOX to watch the game to its conclusion.<ref>The split-screen format for the Touchdown Montage was used on September 21, 2014; at the time in which the Denver at Seattle game went into overtime. The network instructed viewers to switch to CBS if they wanted to see the game out to its conclusion, though it concluded just a minute before off-air time and was taken to full-screen to conclude the day's schedule.</ref>\n\nHowever, it is possible that the 8:00 p.m. deadline is no longer enforced. During week 1 of the 2019 season, the [[Detroit Lions]]-[[Arizona Cardinals]] game went to overtime and extended past the deadline.'' Redzone ''continued showing the game to its completion and then showed the full TD montage, not signing off until past the 8:20&nbsp;p.m. start of Sunday Night Football.\n\n===Off-air periods===\nAfter the broadcast day ends (\u2248 8:00&nbsp;p.m.) ''RedZone'' remains [[Dark (broadcasting)|dark]] until the following Sunday. During the week, as well as during playoffs and off-season, a generic [[Intertitle|title card]] advertisement is shown, accompanied by music from [[NFL Films]]. However, cable providers may overlay their own tie-in title card. Providers are disallowed from using the channel space for other purposes during its off-time.\n\nWhile the ''RedZone'' channel is only utilized for Sunday afternoon games, in the unique instance in which Christmas falls on a Sunday (and the full slate of Week 16 afternoon games is switched to Saturday), the ''RedZone'' is utilized for that Saturday afternoon schedule.\n\n''RedZone'' is not on-air during [[Thursday Night Football|Thursday night]], [[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday night]], [[Monday Night Football|Monday night]], and any stand-alone Saturday night games, nor for [[NFL International Series]] games which are scheduled in an early Sunday morning timeslot. It also does not cover [[NFL on Thanksgiving Day|Thanksgiving games]] or [[National Football League playoffs|postseason games]].\n\nDuring the offseason breaks since the 2016 season, [[NFL Network]] has re-ran the previous season's ''RedZone'' presentations. During seventeen selected Sunday afternoons in the spring and early summer, all seventeen weeks of the regular season as seen on ''RedZone'' are re-aired, with editing for length and content and ad breaks inserted. \n\nThe 2019 re-run of the season was compressed in April 2020 to air throughout the month on consecutive days on a thrice-daily loop on the RedZone channel space, due to the [[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on sports|coronavirus pandemic]] leaving the network wanting of content not involving live studio shows for the safety of their staff, as their facilities in California and the New York/New Jersey metropolitan area were closed due to [[stay-at-home order]]s and to allow NFL Network's traditional Draft run-up shows to air.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nbcsports.com/washington/ravens/nfl-plans-re-air-entire-2019-season-redzone-channel|title=NFL plans to re-air the entire 2019 season on the RedZone channel|last=Cadeaux|first=Ethan|date=3 April 2020|publisher=[[NBC Sports Washington]]|accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2020/04/06/report-espn-nfl-network-could-team-up-for-draft-coverage/|title=Report: ESPN, NFL Network could team up for draft coverage|last=Alper|first=Josh|date=6 April 2020|publisher=[[NBCSports.com]]|accessdate=7 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Preseason===\nThrough 2013, during select nights of the [[National Football League preseason|preseason]], special \"whip around\" coverage aired on the primary [[NFL Network]]. It followed the same style as ''RedZone'' and utilized the same production team and host.\n\nStarting in 2014, preseason \"whip around\" coverage moved to the ''RedZone'' channel itself. On four selected nights in August ''RedZone'' aired as part of a [[free preview]] of the service for all providers. Week 1 (Friday), weeks 2\u20133 (Saturday), and week 4 (Thursday) of the preseason featured the familiar \"whip around\" coverage. The broadcast utilized national and local team coverage feeds, as most preseason games are carried through [[regional sports network]]s or 'state/team networks' made up of local broadcast stations. Coverage started at 7:00&nbsp;p.m. ET\n\nIn 2015, ''RedZone'' aired a free preview during the preseason for five selected nights, and during Week 1 of the regular season. In 2016, ''RedZone'' aired a free preview on four selected nights during the preseason starting August 11 and during Week 1 of the regular season. In 2017, RedZone aired only once during preseason.\n\n===Availability===\nThe RedZone Channel is available on most American pay television providers carrying the NFL Network,<ref>[http://www.multichannel.com/article/328788-Dish_Joins_Comcast_In_NFL_RedZone.php Dish Joins Comcast In NFL RedZone \u2013 Both Distributors Will Kick Off Scoring Ser2009]</ref><ref>[http://www.multichannel.com/article/339248-Updated_Verizon_FiOS_Fires_Up_NFL_RedZone_Deal.php Updated: Verizon FiOS Fires Up NFL RedZone Deal \u2013 Telco Positions Service As Stand-Alone Network Available On A Full-Season Basis] ''Multichannel News'' September 10, 2009</ref><ref>[http://www.multichannel.com/article/346170-AT_T_Adds_NFL_RedZone_To_Lineup.php AT&T Adds NFL RedZone To Lineup \u2013 Telco Will Position Scoring Service On Its HD Premium Tier] ''Multichannel News'' September 11, 2009</ref><ref>[http://www.multichannel.com/article/340269-Blue_Ridge_Enters_NFL_RedZone.php Blue Ridge Enters NFL RedZone \u2013 Operator Adds 'Scoring Channel To HD Plus Package] ''Multichannel News'' September 10, 2009</ref><ref>[http://www.theamericandishtv.com/blog/nfl-redzone-on-dish-network/ NFL RedZone on DISH Network \u2013 Brings You Every NFL Touchdown] ''American DISH Blog'' July 30, 2010</ref><ref>[http://www.multichannel.com/article/456326-Cox_Re_Ups_With_NFL_Network_Adds_RedZone.php Cox Re-Ups With NFL Network, Adds RedZone] ''Multichannel News'' August 24, 2010</ref> and is presented in both standard and high definition; availability of the channel depends on the service tier.

As a \"special\" game-day exclusive, it broadcasts on Sundays during the [[National Football League regular season|NFL regular season]] from 1:00&nbsp;p.m. to 8:00&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]] (10:00&nbsp;a.m. to 5:00&nbsp;p.m. [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific]]), or when the last afternoon window game ends. ''RedZone'' provides \"whip around\" [[simulcast]] coverage of all Sunday afternoon games airing in-progress on [[NFL on CBS|CBS]] and [[NFL on Fox|Fox]].\n\n''RedZone'' is based out of the [[NFL Network]] studios and is hosted by [[Scott Hanson]],<ref name=\"TripInside\">{{cite news|url=http://grantland.com/features/watching-day-nfl-games-redzone-studio/|title=A Trip Inside the RedZone|publisher=Grantland|first=Rembert|last=Brown|date=November 15, 2012|accessdate=September 3, 2014}}</ref> and airs commercial-free. The channel prides itself on showing \"every touchdown from every game,\" and is closely linked to [[Fantasy football (American)|Fantasy Football]],<ref name=\"TripInside\"/> reporting superlatives and tracking various statistical accomplishments throughout the afternoon. ''RedZone'' monitors coverage of the traditional Sunday afternoon 1:00&nbsp;p.m. \"early\" games and 4:05/4:25&nbsp;p.m. \"late\" games.\n\n''RedZone'' is offered by numerous cable providers, [[Dish Network]], and [[Verizon Wireless]] [[smartphone]]s, but specifically is not available on [[DirecTV]], which offers its own version (''[[NFL Sunday Ticket#Extra features|Red Zone Channel]]'' hosted by [[Andrew Siciliano]]) as part of [[NFL Sunday Ticket]].\n\n''[[ESPN Goal Line]]'', a channel which debuted one year later, broadcasts [[college football]] with a similar format and style. The name \"RedZone\" derives from the term [[Red zone (gridiron football)|red zone]], which is the part of the football field between the 20-yard line and the goal line.\n\n==Format==\nOn game day, the ''RedZone'' channel [[Sign-on|signs-on]] at 12:55&nbsp;p.m., or five minutes prior to 1:00&nbsp;p.m., US Eastern time. The countdown clock counts down the minutes and seconds until the start of the game coverage. \n\n===Whip around coverage===\nAt 1:00&nbsp;p.m. (Eastern) the ''RedZone'' program begins, and immediately dives into live look-ins across the league. Host [[Scott Hanson]] gives a brief introduction of the day, highlighting key developing stories, as teams are typically already lining up for opening kickoff. When the first kickoff takes place, Hanson will say \"Seven hours of commercial-free football... starts now!\" Coverage of the opening kickoffs and a cursory look at early drives that are being established are the initial focus. Coverage is normally shown in full-screen, with one particular game as the primary focus for the moment. The coverage is a direct simulcast of the [[NFL on CBS|CBS]] or [[NFL on Fox|Fox]] broadcast feed and commentary, with only occasional and usually brief voice-over comments by Hanson as needed. Coverage sometimes switches to [[Split screen (filmmaking)|split-screen]], with two, three, four (\"quad-box\"<ref name=\"TripInside\"/>), five (\"Penta-box\"), or as many as eight (\"Octo-box\"<ref name=\"TripInside\"/>) game feeds being shown simultaneously. Producers in the studio monitor all game feeds in-progress, and decide which game to feature at any given moment. [[National Football League on television|NFL television rules]] are exempted for ''RedZone'', and live look-ins of games that are subject to [[National Football League television blackout policies|blackout]] are still allowed to be aired in all markets.\n\nWhenever a team enters the [[Red zone (gridiron football)|red zone]], the coverage will switch to a full-screen live look-in of that game's television broadcast. It will attempt to cover a potential scoring result (touchdown or field goal). Meanwhile, the other games continue to be monitored, in case the need arises to switch to another feed at short notice. Field goal attempts from outside the red zone are sometimes shown, either live or in replay, if they pose significance to the outcome of the respective game.\n\nAs the games enter halftime, the coverage shifts over to games still finishing up the second quarter, even if there are no teams in the red zone. Some noncompetitive games that would otherwise not be looked at may take the attention for a few minutes, in order to fill the broadcast with as much live football coverage as possible. As soon as better games start returning for the third quarter, second half kickoffs typically take a priority. \n\nIf there are no teams in the red zone at a given moment, the focus may shift to a team on a strong offensive drive, or an otherwise important game of the day. Despite the channel's moniker, a team does not have to be inside the [[Red zone (gridiron football)|red zone]] for the focus and coverage to shift to that game. During the latter portion of the season, extra sidebar attention may be given to teams fighting for playoff berths, and the respective status thereof. The \"whip around\" coverage also is used to show quick replays of major plays such as turnovers, deep pass completions, very long runs from scrimmage, kickoff/punt return touchdowns, and other potentially interesting or important key plays. The \"Game Rewind\" feature is sometimes used to replay a significant play that resulted in a particular team entering the red zone.\n\nHanson rarely takes any kind of rest break during RedZone's seven hours on the air<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/12/14/370379435/seven-chaotic-hours-behind-the-scenes-at-nfl-redzone|title=7 Chaotic Hours Behind The Scenes At NFL RedZone|last=Sullivan|first=Becky|date=14 December 2014|work=[[NPR]]|accessdate=12 March 2018}}</ref>, and since the early years of the channel he has purposefully planned out his eating and drinking schedule during the regular season to avoid any need for a [[Public toilet|restroom]] break, having boasted on Twitter on December 10, 2017 (that year's Week 14) about his first restroom break in four years of NFL RedZone coverage.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ftw/2017/12/10/nfl-redzone-host-admits-he-took-his-first-bathroom-break-in-four-years/108497432/|title=RedZone host takes first bathroom break in 4 years|last=Joseph|first=Andrew|date=10 December 2017|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=12 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nIt is not unusual for ''RedZone'' to switch between two or more games in quick succession, even between individual plays. Despite an effort made by producers to air all touchdowns [[Live television|live]], some scoring plays are actually aired after a very brief [[Time shifting|time shift]] \u2013 ranging from as much as 30 to 60 seconds \u2013 sometimes because another scoring play is unfolding elsewhere. Time shifting can also occur if the scoring play happened unexpectedly, and/or initiated from outside the red zone. In those cases, the coverage is aired plausibly live with no mention that the coverage is slightly behind real time (though Hanson often tries to introduce the switch with some kind of segue, such as 'while we were watching that (play)...' to note it isn't live video). As the 1 p.m. \"early\" games begin to conclude, ''RedZone'' seamlessly leads into coverage of the 4:05/4:25&nbsp;p.m. \"late\" games, though on afternoons where all early game action has ended, extended statistical rundowns and check-ins on team press conferences may occur to fill the time before those late games start. When the \"early\" games are in the fourth quarter, attention begins to focus on ''one-possession'' games (games within 8 points). Likewise, early games that go into overtime are usually prioritized, but neither at the expense of missing touchdowns in other games that just started.\n\nAs the 4&nbsp;p.m. \"late\" games begin to arrive at their conclusions, coverage will likewise narrow down to the remaining games still ongoing. At which time there is only one game left being played, coverage will switch to full-screen and see out its conclusion, irrespective of its competitiveness. When each game is concluded, a final score alert will flash on the bottom corner of the screen to inform viewers. This is especially important for games that have not had a live look-in for many minutes.\n\nPeriodically throughout the afternoon, producers keep track of and update viewers on the status of [[Fantasy football (American)|fantasy football]] statistics, and/or other statistical superlatives.<ref name=\"TripInside\"/> The channel's priority, however, is to show every touchdown scored in every game throughout the afternoon. During the entire day, ''RedZone'' features a [[News ticker|ticker]] at the bottom of the screen, updating scores and stats throughout the league. The ticker is situated in such a way that it is superimposed over the respective tickers of CBS and [[FoxBox (sports)|FOX]].\n\nOn occasion, technical difficulties could prevent RedZone from showing certain touchdowns live. During Week 1 in the 2019 season, a technical issue with the CBS broadcast prevented a live look at a touchdown in the [[Kansas City Chiefs]]-[[Jacksonville Jaguars]] game; the touchdown was later shown using video from the scoreboard at [[TIAA Bank Field]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2019/09/08/nfl-cbs-drops-chiefs-jaguars-broadcast-over-technical-issues/2258032001/|title=CBS drops Chiefs-Jaguars broadcast in fourth quarter due to technical difficulties|last=Reyes|first=Lorenzo|website=USA TODAY|language=en|access-date=2019-09-15}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/videos/every-td-every-game/0ap3000001052767/Every-TD-from-Every-Game-Week-1|title=Every TD from Every Game {{!}} Week 1|website=NFL.com|language=en|access-date=2019-09-15}}</ref>\n\n===Commercial-free format===\n''RedZone'' operates as a commercial-free service; as such, whenever a game taking primary focus goes to a broadcaster-designated commercial break or other stoppage (such as timeout, instant replay challenge or an injury timeout), the feed will immediately switch to the next most-interesting game in-progress at the moment. Despite the network's commercial-free commitment, commercials are not completely avoided as sometimes the network coverage may take a break faster than expected, causing the first second or two of a commercial to air, before RedZone quickly cuts to another game, which usually includes Hanson jokingly playing off the brush with the accompanying commercial with some kind of snark. Additionally, broadcast network promotions of their programming (most notably CBS and Fox promoting their Sunday night primetime lineups) will be shown as a natural part of the coverage.\n\nIf all games being held at a given moment are on a commercial break or in halftime, coverage will revert to the studio for brief commentary, replays, or statistical analysis by Hanson. In the \"late\" timeslot (when there are fewer games to choose from), highlight packages of selected \"early\" games may be shown during down times.\n\n===Touchdown montage and sign-off===\nThe network's broadcast day ends when the final Sunday afternoon game concludes, or at 8:00&nbsp;p.m. (Eastern). At the conclusion of the coverage, an edited [[Montage (filmmaking)|montage]] of every touchdown scored throughout the afternoon is aired. Until 2018, due to contractual obligations, ''RedZone'' was required to [[sign-off]] no later than 8:00&nbsp;p.m., even if a late afternoon game(s) was still in progress; this was rectified in the 2019 season, and any game that ends after 8:00&nbsp;p.m. will continue airing on ''RedZone'' until its conclusion. If the ''RedZone'' signs-off with inadequate time for the touchdown montage (which can vary from 5\u201310 minutes in duration), it will be posted online instead. At the onset, the total number of touchdowns for the afternoon by type (offensive, defensive, and special teams) is listed on a graphic, with a running tally for the entire season also shown.\n\nIn some cases, when games are running close to the 8:00&nbsp;p.m. deadline, the touchdown montage has been shown in a [[Split screen (video production)|split-screen]] format. The montage is shown in a prominent square with audio, while the game still being played is shown in a lesser square in the corner of the screen without audio. This is done particularly when the game still being played is a nationally-televised game \u2013 a situation in which most viewers in most markets across the country (per NFL television rules) could simply switch to CBS or FOX to watch the game to its conclusion.<ref>The split-screen format for the Touchdown Montage was used on September 21, 2014; at the time in which the Denver at Seattle game went into overtime. The network instructed viewers to switch to CBS if they wanted to see the game out to its conclusion, though it concluded just a minute before off-air time and was taken to full-screen to conclude the day's schedule.</ref>\n\nHowever, it is possible that the 8:00 p.m. deadline is no longer enforced. During week 1 of the 2019 season, the [[Detroit Lions]]-[[Arizona Cardinals]] game went to overtime and extended past the deadline.'' Redzone ''continued showing the game to its completion and then showed the full TD montage, not signing off until past the 8:20&nbsp;p.m. start of Sunday Night Football.\n\n===Off-air periods===\nAfter the broadcast day ends (\u2248 8:00&nbsp;p.m.) ''RedZone'' remains [[Dark (broadcasting)|dark]] until the following Sunday. During the week, as well as during playoffs and off-season, a generic [[Intertitle|title card]] advertisement is shown, accompanied by music from [[NFL Films]]. However, cable providers may overlay their own tie-in title card. Providers are disallowed from using the channel space for other purposes during its off-time.\n\nWhile the ''RedZone'' channel is only utilized for Sunday afternoon games, in the unique instance in which Christmas falls on a Sunday (and the full slate of Week 16 afternoon games is switched to Saturday), the ''RedZone'' is utilized for that Saturday afternoon schedule.\n\n''RedZone'' is not on-air during [[Thursday Night Football|Thursday night]], [[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday night]], [[Monday Night Football|Monday night]], and any stand-alone Saturday night games, nor for [[NFL International Series]] games which are scheduled in an early Sunday morning timeslot. It also does not cover [[NFL on Thanksgiving Day|Thanksgiving games]] or [[National Football League playoffs|postseason games]].\n\nDuring the offseason breaks since the 2016 season, [[NFL Network]] has re-ran the previous season's ''RedZone'' presentations. During seventeen selected Sunday afternoons in the spring and early summer, all seventeen weeks of the regular season as seen on ''RedZone'' are re-aired, with editing for length and content and ad breaks inserted. The 2019 re-run of the season was compressed in April 2020 to air throughout the month on consecutive days three times daily, due to the [[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on sports|coronavirus pandemic]] leaving the network wanting of content not involving live studio shows for the safety of their staff, as their facilities in California and the New York/New Jersey metropolitan area were closed due to [[stay-at-home order]]s.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nbcsports.com/washington/ravens/nfl-plans-re-air-entire-2019-season-redzone-channel|title=NFL plans to re-air the entire 2019 season on the RedZone channel|last=Cadeaux|first=Ethan|date=3 April 2020|publisher=[[NBC Sports Washington]]|accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2020/04/06/report-espn-nfl-network-could-team-up-for-draft-coverage/|title=Report: ESPN, NFL Network could team up for draft coverage|last=Alper|first=Josh|date=6 April 2020|publisher=[[NBCSports.com]]|accessdate=7 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Preseason===\nThrough 2013, during select nights of the [[National Football League preseason|preseason]], special \"whip around\" coverage aired on the primary [[NFL Network]]. It followed the same style as ''RedZone'' and utilized the same production team and host.\n\nStarting in 2014, preseason \"whip around\" coverage moved to the ''RedZone'' channel itself. On four selected nights in August ''RedZone'' aired as part of a [[free preview]] of the service for all providers. Week 1 (Friday), weeks 2\u20133 (Saturday), and week 4 (Thursday) of the preseason featured the familiar \"whip around\" coverage. The broadcast utilized national and local team coverage feeds, as most preseason games are carried through [[regional sports network]]s or 'state/team networks' made up of local broadcast stations. Coverage started at 7:00&nbsp;p.m. ET\n\nIn 2015, ''RedZone'' aired a free preview during the preseason for five selected nights, and during Week 1 of the regular season. In 2016, ''RedZone'' aired a free preview on four selected nights during the preseason starting August 11 and during Week 1 of the regular season. In 2017, RedZone aired only once during preseason.\n\n===Availability===\nThe RedZone Channel is available on most American pay television providers carrying the NFL Network,<ref>[http://www.multichannel.com/article/328788-Dish_Joins_Comcast_In_NFL_RedZone.php Dish Joins Comcast In NFL RedZone \u2013 Both Distributors Will Kick Off Scoring Ser2009]</ref><ref>[http://www.multichannel.com/article/339248-Updated_Verizon_FiOS_Fires_Up_NFL_RedZone_Deal.php Updated: Verizon FiOS Fires Up NFL RedZone Deal \u2013 Telco Positions Service As Stand-Alone Network Available On A Full-Season Basis] ''Multichannel News'' September 10, 2009</ref><ref>[http://www.multichannel.com/article/346170-AT_T_Adds_NFL_RedZone_To_Lineup.php AT&T Adds NFL RedZone To Lineup \u2013 Telco Will Position Scoring Service On Its HD Premium Tier] ''Multichannel News'' September 11, 2009</ref><ref>[http://www.multichannel.com/article/340269-Blue_Ridge_Enters_NFL_RedZone.php Blue Ridge Enters NFL RedZone \u2013 Operator Adds 'Scoring Channel To HD Plus Package] ''Multichannel News'' September 10, 2009</ref><ref>[http://www.theamericandishtv.com/blog/nfl-redzone-on-dish-network/ NFL RedZone on DISH Network \u2013 Brings You Every NFL Touchdown] ''American DISH Blog'' July 30, 2010</ref><ref>[http://www.multichannel.com/article/456326-Cox_Re_Ups_With_NFL_Network_Adds_RedZone.php Cox Re-Ups With NFL Network, Adds RedZone] ''Multichannel News'' August 24, 2010</ref> and is presented in both standard and high definition; availability of the channel depends on the service tier.

He is friend with Rudy and is in an unreciprocated love with Anna. He is very good in singing but terrible in dancing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gingergeneration.it/n/new-school-ecco-tutti-i-personaggi-della-serie-356749-n.htm|title=New School: Ecco tutti i personaggi della serie!|first=di Laura|last=Boni|date=April 19, 2019}}</ref>\n* Edoardo Tarantini as Rudy Hansen, an 11 years old boy that is friend with Nick, that he knows from when they were in kindergarten. He is also the older brother of Alice. He is bungling but quite creative and very kind despite a little childish. He is not very much interested in popularity and girls but he is very appassionate of [[sci-fi]] movies and [[superheroes]], and his favorite superhero is Ragazzo Lupo. He is hopeless in singing but very good in dancing and he has a web channel in which he publishes his dance tutorials.\n* Cloe Romagnoli as Anna De Martino, a 12 years old girl that is friend of Nick and Rudy and that is in love with Justin. She is quite intelligent and pragmatic but her love for Justin get her really easily distracted.\n* Noemi Brazzoli as Vivien Mandelli, a 12 years old girl very popular in the school and that indeed is always stably in the firsts positions on the App. Thanks to her popularity almost no one dares to contradict her. She is also the head cheerleader. She is very egocentric and self-regarding and always talk of herself in third person and often takes selfies. In the first season she starts to date Justin not much for love but just because she thinks that is natural that the most attractive girl would date the most attractive boy. She is allergic to cats. \n* Diego Delpiano as Justin Price, a 12 years old boy very popular. He loves a lot sports and takes a lot of care about his look and shape and constantly exercise to be in good shape and develop a good muscular system but he is not very intelligent and is quite naive. He has a teddy bear, Orso. He also has some immature mannerisms like being afraid of darkness, still needing to keep near him his teddy bear to sleep and sometimes he starts to laugh without motivation.\n* Alice Papes as Alice Hansen, a 9 years old girl, little sister of Rudy and a genius. Very often she spends time in labs, with test tubes or reading and she is able to put a point on surprising inventions and cutting-edge scientific research. She still sleeps with her peluche, Piripocchio. But she really wishes to be more included and to have friends.\n* Andrea Castronovo and Paolo Castronovo as Tim and Tom, two identical twins. They don't study much but thanks to their cunning, physical strength and coordination are almost always able to obtain what they wish and compensate their lack of study by being sure to obtain others' work or by cheating. Despite not being interested to be part of the Wall, very often they challenge others, especially Nick and Rudy, for fun and the sake of it. They are almost impossible to distinguish from each other, but, while Tim is allergic to cats, Tom isn't.\n* Nicole Di Julio as Charlotte. She started to appear during the second season. She is a gruff bully and is able to scare everyone, included the principal, and her only weak spot is her big crush on Nick, that she nicknamed Sogliola.\n* Alberto Torquati as Mr. Peter Spencer, the principal of the school. He tries to always adopt a rigid and severe attitude with his students who, however, do not respect him much. Precisely for this reason the best way to get something from him is to congratulate and please him. Mr. Spencer has only two weapons to try to be respected by the students that are to send them to his office as punishment and seize their belongings. He is very scared of the superintendent, that control him remotely. He has a lot of hobbies and passions like baking but his life outside school is mysterious. Mr. Spencer loves traditions and the story of the school, the rites, the special days and the ceremonies. He has in high regard the founder of the school, Mr. McGaffin. One of his duties is to give the announces at the start of every day with the mic in his office.\n* Federica Fabiani as Miss Mastermind, the cook of the school. She is a very cold woman and doesn't smile very often. She also treats often with sarcasm the students. But the reason behind her attitude is how in the past a love story she had with Mr. Spencer didn't end well.\n* Riccardo Diana as the superintendent. He never appears phisically but he is heard during calls. He controls the work of the school.\n\n==Episodes==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! Season \n! Episodes\n!

The Chinese personnel on the Aylward delegation numbered 12 out of 25 total, and it was reported that they were able to manipulate the language used in the delegation's final report, with one of the delegates later declaring \"we wanted to call it a \u2018dangerous\u2019 pathogen, and they felt the word \u2018dangerous\u2019 could be linked to bio-terrorism\".

The examination has been discontinued in 2012 and its roles are now replaced by the [[Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education]] as part of [[334 Scheme|educational reforms]] in Hong Kong.\n\n== Overview ==\nStudents usually took the HKCEE at the end of their five-year period of secondary school in Hong Kong; it was compulsory for students who wanted to pursue further education, but some students took individual examinations to increase their chance of continuing their study or to fulfil certain requirements in tertiary education programs. \n \nThe final year in which school candidates were accepted was 2010. There were 127,162 candidates entered for the examination, 90,063 of them school candidates and 37,099 private candidates.\n\nThe HKCEE was conducted from late February to June, but major subjects were taken between mid-April and May, after the major subjects examination in the [[Hong Kong Advanced Level Examination]] were completed, by the Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority ([[HKEAA]]). Oral examinations were conducted in late May to early July.\n\nExamination results were released in early August, traditionally on the Wednesday after the first-round admission of the [[Joint University Programmes Admissions System]] had been released. There were 39 subjects available in the HKCEE. Most day-school candidates took 6 to 8 subjects in the HKCEE, with 10 being the upper limit. Apart from Chinese and English, which were taken by almost every school candidate, and language-specific subjects (French, [[Chinese History]] (Chinese only), [[buddhism|Buddhist Studies]] (Chinese only), Literature in English (English only), [[Putonghua]] (Chinese only) and [[Word Processing]] and Business Communication (English only), all subjects could be taken in either Chinese or English. The same standards were applied in marking and grading regardless of the choice of language, and the language medium was not recorded on the results notices or certificates. It was, however, recorded on admission forms.\n\n==Purpose==\nAfter sitting the HKCEE and having their examination results announced, candidates could apply for a place in sixth form in local schools in Hong Kong. Moreover, to qualify for the [[Hong Kong Advanced Level Examination]] (HKALE), students had to pass certain requirements of HKCEE as a prerequisite. The [[Joint University Programmes Admissions System]] (JUPAS), including the [[Early Admissions Scheme (Hong Kong)|EAS system]] under JUPAS, also considered students' HKCEE results as a requirement and as a decisive factor of admission in the admission processes. Thus, students' results in HKCEE affected their application to sixth form but also directly affected the chance of entering the universities after seventh form, which was commonly ignored by students until they entered sixth form. In JUPAS, most admissions programs gave HKCEE results about a 10\u201330% weight, and some as much as 50%; the HKALE results provided the other 50%.<ref>JUPAS Walkthrough 2008, Mingpao Education Net, 2007</ref> Thus, HKCEE was the initial stage of University Entrance Examination.\n\nThe HKCEE was fully recognised by other countries including New Zealand, Australia, the UK, the US and many other major countries. It was equivalent to Year 11 in Australia and in the UK.\n\nFor comparison, the Mathematics syllabus of HKCEE was equivalent to New Zealand's [[National Certificate of Educational Achievement]] Level 2 Mathematics at Form 6 (Year 12) level (excluding Calculus) rather than NCEA Level 1 or its predecessor the [[School Certificate (New Zealand)|School Certificate]] examination, sat by the country's Form 5 (Year 11) students.\n\n[[Additional Mathematics]] in the HKCEE was  more advanced than NCEA Level 3 Mathematics with Calculus, sat by Form 7 (Year 13) students in New Zealand to gain university entrance in science and engineering. HKCEE's Additional Mathematics was also recognised by most of the programs in Hong Kong's universities as equivalent to [[HKALE]] Pure Mathematics.\n\nFor the examination questions on the same topics, those in HKCEE tended to be loaded with unclear wordings and difficult manipulations {{clarify|date=February 2011}}, compared with their NCEA counterparts.\n\nIn other subjects, such as the sciences like [[Chemistry]] and [[Physics]], the syllabus covered in HKCEE was similar to that of the [[SAT Subject Tests]] sat in Grade 12, but it was arguably easier to obtain a score of 760 on the [[SAT Subject Tests]] than to obtain a grade of A in the HKCEE examination although Grade 12 was theoretically equivalent to Form 6 under the Hong Kong school system.\n\n==Grading and UK equivalence==\nThe results of the HKCEE are expressed in terms of seven grades A \u2013 U (or 5*-1 and U for Chinese and English) other than French.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Grade \n! Point(s) \n! Recognition\n!

It means they will have no future and must be beggars.) \n|}\nIn the past, there were two other grades below UNCL: G and H. They were called \"Grenade\" and \"Ladder\".\n\nResults below grade 'F' are designated as unclassified (\"UNCL\"), assigned either when candidates hand in unanswered or unintelligible paper(s), or when candidates are assumed to have cheated. Candidates not taking the exam are designated as Absent ('ABS') for that subject.\n\nBefore 2002 grades A \u2013 F were each divided into two \"fine grades\", making the original number of grades available twelve, from A(01) to F(12). The fine grades in both HKCEE and HKALE were lifted in 2002, as they were accused of being discriminatory to students. {{clarify|date=February 2011}}\n\nMost of the results are graded \"on the curve\" but at the same time a cutoff score for each grade is also used. Obtaining an A is very difficult, especially for languages in the past system, where only about 1.5\u20133% of students received A's. On average, only the top 3\u20134% in each subject can get an A. The cutoff scores vary greatly from subject to subject and from year to year. To give a clearer picture, for Chinese, A-grades are sometimes given for candidates having scored 70 or above, while for Mathematics, an A invariably translates to a score in excess of 90. The cutoff scores are not released by the HKEAA publicly; the information is only available to teachers.\n\nOfficial statistics can be found on the HKEAA website: https://web.archive.org/web/20051124073914/http://www.hkeaa.edu.hk/doc/fd/2004cee/39-60.pdf\n\n=== New Grading System ===\n\nSince 2007, as a steppingstone towards the grading system HKDSE that will be introduced in 2010, a new grading system was introduced to the exams in the subjects of Chinese and English.  Under the new system There are seven grades: five numerical grades from 1\u20135, where 1 is the lowest and 5 is the highest, and two other grades, \"5*\" and \"UNCL\", for students with particularly outstanding and poor performance respectively. The traditional \"on-the-curve\" system was not used other than to distinguish between the 5*'s and the 5's.\n\nThe point system was in chaos in its first year of implementation since level 2, which is the passing line in HKEAA, counts as two points in some schools and the HKEAA, but counts as one point in EMB and most schools. This counting process not only confused Form 5 students, but also some Form 6 students who repeated the exam to obtain better Language results for JUPAS admissions.  The problems with the points system caused changes in the method for calculating points in HKEAA in the following years.\n\nSince the two syllabi in English were merged into one along with the new system, some schools were worried that the level of English is insufficient for the HKALE as they expect HKEAA will decrease the difficulty to allow students who previously studied in Syllabus A(mainly from some non-EMI schools) to pass more easily. This resulted in some schools rejecting students who had a level 2 in English.\n\nThe system will be fully utilised in all major subjects in the HKDSE.\n\n===Further Studies===\n\nStudents' results in HKCEE and their conduct (behavior at school which is usually shown in the school's internal report) at school are the main admission factors in Secondary 6, which is the main stream for university admission. In EMB's official admission processes, students with 4 passed subjects, or 3 passes with 5 marks (both excluding language subjects) is the minimum requirement. Students with 14 marks above, including passes in English and one other Language subject have an advantage as they can be admitted from the first stage of Form 6 admissions. Students scoring 30 marks (the maximum) with L4/C in two designated language subjects (one of which must be English) in their first attempt will be permitted to apply to the [[Early Admissions Scheme (Hong Kong)|Direct Entry]] for the 3 major Universities in Hong Kong (see below). {{clarify|date=February 2011}}\n\nRequirements of sitting in HKALE are independent from Form 6 admissions since they are managed by separate organisations. A student who passes all the minimum requirements for sitting in HKALE also meets all the requirements for applying for Form 6, but not vice versa. Schools may admit a student who failed in language subjects, providing that the school would bear the risk that he/she may not pass again in the following year, not allowing them to sit for the HKALE.\n\nFor admissions to the four-year Higher Diploma programs in [[Hong Kong Institute of Vocational Education|HKIVE]] and degrees in The University of Hong Kong, [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]], and the University of Science and Technology, the best 7 subjects, instead of 6, are counted. In other cases, the best 5 or 6 subjects are counted. The Chinese University of Hong Kong, in addition, did not accept \"combined certificates\" (results obtained in more than two examinations) and must be fulfilled in a single attempt (usually the first one).\n\n===International recognition===\n\nHKEAA has been working closely with international agencies, overseas universities and colleges to promote recognition of HKEAA examinations. Standards of performance in the HKCEE and HKALE have for many years been benchmarked against standards in comparable subjects at British GCE O-Level and A/AS-Level. In the case of performance in the English Language, studies have been conducted to link standards of performance in HKCEE English Language (Syllabus B) and HKALE Use of English to standards in [[IELTS]] and [[TOEFL]].\n\nStarting from 2007, HKCEE standards-referenced reporting was adopted in Chinese language and English language subjects. The results in the two subjects have also been benchmarked against International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE) results.\n\nThe Hong Kong Diploma for Secondary Education Examination (HKDSE) will be conducted for the first time in 2012. To secure appropriate recognition of HKDSE qualifications, the HKEAA has been holding discussions with international agencies including [[University of Cambridge International Examinations]] (CIE), [[National Academic Recognition Information Centre]] (NARIC), [[UCAS|Universities and Colleges Admissions Service]] (UCAS) in the UK and the [[Australian Education International]] (AEI) in Australia to conduct benchmarking and comparability research on HKDSE.\n\nAlthough HKEAA examinations have been widely accepted, some universities have set particular criteria for admission of overseas students. For instance, the [[University of Cambridge]] in the UK has set out admission requirements for under-age or minor candidates concerning guardianship arrangements.\n\nIn cases where candidates wish to further their studies abroad, they may be required to take as one of the basic requirements certain unified examinations conducted by the examination authorities of that particular country. These include, for example, the [[National Higher Education Entrance Examination]] for Universities in Mainland China and the [[SAT]] for the United States.\n\nUK NARIC is the UK's National Agency for the UK Government. They are the official information provider on information on wide-ranging international qualifications and skills attained from outside the UK.\n\nAlthough NARIC is a National Agency for the UK Government, the institutions of higher education may make their own decision on what foreign qualifications or study they will accept, and UK NARIC has only an advisory role.\n\nThe two new HKCEE language subjects have been benchmarked against the International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE) by the Cambridge Assessment. The HKCEE results in Chinese Language and English Language are recognised as equivalent to the IGCSE results as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| HKCEE \n| IGCSE\n|-\n| 5*\n| A* \n|-\n| 5 \n| A \n|- \n| 4\n| B \n|- \n| 3 \n| C \n|- \n|}\n\n==Marking schemes==\nWhile the HKEAA have been publishing booklets of past examination papers of each subject at an affordable price, the marking schemes (i.e. official detailed solutions) of past examinations were never readily available to the public. The official argument from the HKEAA for not publishing these marking schemes was that it might be \"pedagogically unsound\" and would encourage \"rote memorisation\" behaviour from students. Nevertheless, students were often able to obtain these \"restricted documents\" by taking classes at [[Cram schools in Hong Kong|cram schools]]. Hence, the policy of the HKEAA indirectly denied less privileged students from gaining access to information pertaining to how examination papers are scored. This might have created a socio-economic bias in the ability of students to obtain good results in the HKCEE. Moreover, according to media reports, some so-called \"star tutors\" managed to earn more than [[Hong Kong dollar|HK$]]7 million per annum (~[[United States dollar|US$]]900,000), leading some to speculate that the HKEAA's policy had indirectly transferred large amounts of wealth to these cram schools.\n\nTo deal with this problem, the HKEAA started to release the marking schemes together with the year's examination papers in 2003.\n\n==HKSAR Government Scholarship==\nThe HKSAR Government Scholarship is a prestigious award associated with the HKCEE Examination. The top 30\u201340 candidates in the HKCEE Examination receive this scholarship each year. Counterintuitively, many 10A students fail to receive this award. This apparent paradox is mainly due to the methodology in which the HKSAR Government Scholarship is awarded. Rather than calculating the number of A's each student has, the HKSAR Government Scholarship is awarded on the basis of the highest total in raw scores attained in the seven best subjects of each student. Consequently, many 9A, 8A, and even 7A students go on to win this award while 10A students go home empty handed. This has been a major source of complaint {{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} from eager parents of 10A students who felt cheated from this coveted prize.\n\n==Early Admissions Scheme==\n{{main|Early Admissions Scheme (Hong Kong)}}\nThe Early Admissions Scheme (or simply \"EAS\"), a subsystem of the [[Joint University Programmes Admissions System]] (JUPAS) since 2003, allowed school Candidates with 6 or more \"A\"s (Distinctions) on their first attempt of the HKCEE, with level 4 or above in English Language, and also level 4 or above in Chinese Language or \"C\" or above in French or Putonghua to apply for the [[University of Hong Kong]], [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]], or the [[Hong Kong University of Science and Technology]] institutions after their Secondary 6 study, without the need to sit for the HKALE.\n\nEach year about 400\u2013600 students entered the scheme via this subsystem in JUPAS. A selection procedure exists in this scheme but, unlike the mainstream scheme of JUPAS, the students are guaranteed a firm offer in EAS regardless of the number of applicants in EAS. Students who met the EAS requirements do not need to apply for this scheme to enter the aforementioned universities (though most of them will), but they need to take part in the HKALE and participate in the mainstream scheme if they did not participate and want to pursue their studies in Hong Kong.\n\nThere are also rare cases where students who were eligible for the EAS are given independent offers by universities outside EAS.\n\n==List of subjects==\nSubjects in bold are the major examination subjects (which over 20% of students sit); most secondary schools will provide these curricula for students.\n\n*Accommodation and Catering Services <sup>2</sup>\n*'''[[Additional Mathematics]]'''\n*'''Biology'''\n*Buddhist Studies <sup>1</sup>\n*'''Chemistry'''\n*'''Chinese History'''\n*'''Chinese Language'''\n*Chinese Literature\n*'''Commerce'''\n*'''Computer and Information Technology'''\n*Design and Technology <sup>5</sup>\n*Design and Technology (Alternative Syllabus) <sup>5</sup>\n*Economic and Public Affairs <sup>3</sup>\n*'''Economics <sup>3</sup>'''\n*Electronics and Electricity\n*'''English Language'''\n*Fashion and Clothing <sup>4</sup>\n*French\n*'''Geography'''\n*Government and Public Affairs\n*Graphical Communication\n*'''History'''\n*Home Economics (Dress and Design) <sup>4</sup>\n*Home Economics (Food, Home and Family) <sup>2</sup>\n*Integrated Humanities\n*Literature in English\n*'''Mathematics'''\n*Music\n*Physical Education\n*'''Physics'''\n*'''Principles of Accounts'''\n*Putonghua\n*Religious Studies <sup>1</sup>\n*Science and Technology\n*Social Studies\n*Technological Studies <sup>5</sup>\n*Travel and Tourism\n*Visual Art\n*Word Processing and Business Communication (English)\n\n# Buddhist Studies may not be taken with Religious studies; Religious Studies are available in Protestant and Catholic versions on the same paper, which varies in the citations of the Bible.

Starting from 2006, two subjects\u2014Chinese History and History\u2014have been implented with the school-based assessment, replacing the previous multiple choice paper in public examinations.\n\nOwing to the transition from the seven-year curriculum (five years of secondary and two years of [[sixth form]] / matriculation) to a six-year curriculum of secondary education, the HKCEE and the [[HKALE]] will be phased out and replaced with a new examination, the [[Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education]] Examination (HKDSE).\n\nIn 2007, the curricula for Chinese and English were revised. The two subjects were no longer graded along the [[normal distribution]] curve but rather by criteria referencing (with the exception of the highest grade, the 5*). Numerical levels are used instead of the traditional letter grades.\n\nThe proposed revisions specific to Chinese include:\n*The removal of the 26 selected essays, excerpts from the classics, poems and ancient lyrics in the original curriculum, replacing them with a selection of reading materials by the teachers.\n*Independent reading comprehension and writing papers.\n*The addition of a listening comprehension examination.\n*The addition of a speaking (oral) examination.\n*The addition of a paper testing integrated skills.\n*The addition of a [[school-based assessment]] (SBA) scheme that accounts for 20% of the exam mark.\n\nThe proposed revisions specific to English include:\n*The abolishment of two separate syllabi. Before 2007, two syllabi coexisted. Syllabus B was an [[O-level]] course and Syllabus A was easier but inferior. For HKEAA/EMB's view, grades attained on syllabus A were considered to be inferior to grades attained on syllabus B (e.g. a C on syllabus A was equivalent to an E on syllabus B), except in Form 6 admission and HKALE requirements in which the two syllabi were considered the same.\n**However, many universities and secondary schools claimed that the gap should have been larger. According to the report by HKEAA comparing the student's Use of English in HKALE with their previous result in HKCEE English, the passing rate of use of English for which candidates received a C on syllabus A is far lower than that of candidates who received an E in syllabus B.\n*The abolishment of the testing of grammar and language usage which was once part of the old reading comprehension and usage paper. (Grammar will be tested alongside comprehension in the same section)\n*A refined writing paper, now requiring two separate pieces of writing, one guided, one independent and more open-ended.\n*A refined reading comprehension paper, with questions requiring written answers instead of the old format in which every question was a multiple choice question.\n*A refined speaking skills paper, requiring more independent thinking than the previous routinised paper.\n*The addition of a school-based assessment scheme that accounts for 15% of the exam mark.\n\nHKEAA had also announced that candidates who sat in the 2006 exam who wished to retake Chinese or English subjects were to take the new syllabi. It is questionable whether those candidates, who were used to the old syllabi, could adapt to the structure of the new syllabi in nearly half a year.\n\n==Controversies==\n===1997 HKEA Senior Subject Officer Assisted his Son to Achieve 8As by Stealing Examination Papers and Marking Schemes===\n\nThe HKEA received reports from several examiners that a candidate, whose academic performance at school was poor, scored almost full marks in every paper he sat. His answers were identical to those in the marking schemes. The HKEAA suspected that someone had obtained the question papers and marking schemes in advance of the examinations in breach of the regulations. The case was referred to the [[Independent Commission Against Corruption (Hong Kong)|ICAC]] for investigation and the candidate's results were withheld pending the outcome of the investigation. It transpired that the candidate's father was Mak Cheung Wah, then an assistant senior subject panel of the HKEA and was in possession of the keys to the safe deposit. Mak used the key to open the safe deposit and took away copies of question papers and marking schemes in every subject for his son to read prior to the examinations. Mak's son memorised the answers and wrote them on the answer scripts to score high marks. The ICAC only managed to solve the case moments before the release of the results. Mak's son was disqualified and his 8A results were annulled. Mak was found guilty of [[theft]] and [[misfeasance in public office]] and was ordered by the [[District Court]] to do 240 hours of [[community service]].\nHe was also dismissed by the HKEA and lost his pension of HK$1.1 million. Since then, the HKEA and the ICAC reviewed the security arrangements of examination documents. Now the HKEAA only produces the marking schemes after the examinations have taken place. <ref>\u300aHong Kong Certificate of Education Examination Annual Report 1997\u300b\uff0cHong Kong\uff1aHong Kong Examinations Authority\uff0c1997\u3002</ref> <ref>\u300aWen Wei Po\u300b\uff0cHong Kong\uff0c6 May 2005. </ref>\n\n===2005 English Language (Syllabus B) grading error===\nIn 2005, the oral component of the Syllabus B English language examination was incorrectly added to the total score because of a recent upgrade to the HKEAA computer system, and the supervisor in charge failed to double-check the results. Subsequently, many candidates received an incorrect total score, which resulted in an incorrect final grade for the subject. The problem was so severe that some students wrongfully received an F grade (the second-lowest grade) when they were supposed to receive an A (the highest grade) in the oral section. Since the final English mark is calculated by averaging the marks in the oral, reading comprehension, listening, and writing sections, having an F in oral would have seriously affected the final English mark if the candidate did well in other components.\n\nIn an attempt to mitigate the situation, the HKEAA publicly apologised and offered free rechecks on the oral component of the English language subject for all candidates. Candidates who would have had a higher score if the error had not occurred received an upgrade. In total, the error affected 670 candidates, and 422 candidates had their oral component mark upgraded while 248 had their overall English subject grade upgraded. The cascade reaction affected 233 candidates who were eligible for sixth form.\n\nHowever, the mistake was discovered far too late. It was discovered when the admissions process was almost over. Since some candidates were unable to find a school for their matriculate education because they received an incorrect grade, the [[Education and Manpower Bureau]] was forced to increase the school quotas for some schools to accommodate the affected students. HKEAA chairman Irving Koo assured the students that their education would not be affected by the error.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/stdn/std/Metro/GH13Ak01.html |title=Exams body in another blunder |first=Chester |last=Yung |publisher=[[The Standard (Hong Kong)|The Standard]] |date=13 August 2005 |accessdate=14 April 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090404031739/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/stdn/std/Metro/GH13Ak01.html |archivedate=4 April 2009 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n===2005 English Language (Syllabus B) incident===\nA proofreading exercise in Paper 2 of the HKCEE English Language (Syllabus B) quoted a message that was adapted from an online forum. Some students flamed on that forum in anger after the exam. That caused the HKEAA to hold several internal meetings banning the use of messages from the online forum.\n\n===2006 English Language (Syllabus B) paper 2 incident===\nThe HKCEE English Language (Syllabus B) 2006, the last year for the syllabus, was administered on 4 May 2006. Paper 2, Reading Comprehension and Usage, had some candidates complained that the HKEAA, in providing all of the study sources via the Internet, created the potential for candidates to access the solutions with electronic devices such as [[personal digital assistant]]s and cellphones while they were in the toilet. The rumour was first spread on local forums and [https://web.archive.org/web/20060402230455/http://ufhks.com/ Young-M]. The incident generated widespread public furore.\n\nNumerous discussions were initiated on local forums. Candidates sitting for the paper demanded a retake of the paper and an apology from the HKEAA. Some candidates collaborated with political parties to hold protests against the HKEAA's decision to not readminister the paper. A [https://web.archive.org/web/20060621223158/http://ufhks.com/main/na3/memo.php?bd=hkeaa&&no=9&re=0 protest (Cantonese)] was proposed for 31 May or 1 July.\n\nOn [http://forum.uwants.com/viewthread.php?tid=2140003 a local forum], a candidate threatened to sue the HKEAA by saying that justice needed to be defended. More than 100 complaints were received by the HKEAA regarding the incident.\n\nThe actual articles used in the exam:\n*[https://www.usatoday.com/life/2001-08-31-parapara.htm], an article on the [[Para Para]] scene in Hong Kong, published by ''[[USA Today]]'' on 31 August 2001.\n*[http://www.stoptextbully.com], a website about [[cyberbullying]], had numerous grammatical and structural mistakes.\n\n===2007 Chinese Language paper 2 incident===\nIn 2007 HKCEE Chinese Language Paper 2 (Writing), Question 2 'Lemon Tea' was suspected to be leaked beforehand since a tutor, [[Siu Yuen]] from [[King's Glory Education Centre]] gave his students a sample article of a similar title, 'Iced Lemon Tea', well before the exam. That led to assumption that the tutor had knowledge of the question in the actual exam.\n\nTwo students lodged a complaint to the. A spokesperson of the HKEAA stated that copying by candidates will result in no marks given to the plagiarised parts.\n\n===2007 English Language questions leakage incident===\nBefore the examination date of English Language Papers in 2007, \"Mr. Ken\", one of the well-known tutors at the Modern Education Centre in Hong Kong, called his students back to the tutorial centre for a few days before the test to review some material on fashion. It was later found that the actual test had some of the same topics and even some questions identical that were identical, fuelling worries of a possible leakage.\n\n===2008 Chinese Language incident===\nControversies were in two papers: paper 1, comprehension, and paper 5, integrated skills.\n\nIn paper 1, the format in previous years was that two passages were supplied, one in [[Vernacular Chinese]] and one in [[Classical Chinese]], and candidates were required to answer questions mainly in words. In 2008, however, the second passage was a [[Chinese poetry|Chinese poem]] instead. Also, half of the total scores were from [[multiple choice]] questions, and in some questions, choices were said to be difficult to distinguish. For example, in question 5, the four choices were \"believable\" (\u53ef\u4ee5\u76f8\u4fe1), \"affirmative\" (\u80af\u5b9a\u7684\u662f), \"proved by facts\" (\u4e8b\u5be6\u8b49\u660e) and \"undeniable\" (\u7121\u53ef\u5426\u8a8d). Some teachers said that they could not even make the relevant decisions in a short period of time or said that the paper required deduction skills and common sense rather than Chinese knowledge, and some candidates said the paper was more like gambling than an examination. Some also commented that the passages were too difficult for CE level. Even a university professor admitted that he could not finish the exam in a reasonable amount of time. The first Vernacular Chinese passage was said to be of the difficulty of Form 7 [[Hong Kong Advanced Level Examination|Advanced Level Examination]] Chinese Language and Culture, and the second poem, [[Moonlight of Spring River]] (\u6625\u6c5f\u82b1\u6708\u591c) in [[Tang Dynasty]], was said to be of the difficulty of university Chinese.<ref>{{cite news\n |script-title = zh:\u300c\u596a\u547d\u56db\u5f0f\u300d\u8003\u8d77\u6703\u8003\u751f\n |url          = http://hk.news.yahoo.com/080425/60/2t27i.html\n |publisher    = [[Sing Tao Daily]]\n |date         = 26 April 2008\n |accessdate   = 29 April 2008\n |language     = Chinese\n |url-status      = dead\n |archiveurl   = https://web.archive.org/web/20080428204826/http://hk.news.yahoo.com/080425/60/2t27i.html\n |archivedate  = 28 April 2008\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}</ref> the HKESA replied that papers can be set in any format and style.\n\nIn paper 5, candidates were required to listen to a recording and do various tasks, but both the recording and the data file were criticised. A [[Halloween]] advertisement was included in the recording, and some candidates afterward said that they felt uneasy or thought the radio channel was switched. In the data file, Chinese slang terms were discussed in an extract from a newspaper article and in a poster promoting reading. Some teachers and students criticised the materials for promoting slang terms, some students said that they had not heard of such terms and others said that the HKEAA had misconceptions about the use of the slang terms. The Authority responded that, as is the norm, some of the materials provided were deliberately false or worthless to promote critical thinking and choice-taking by students.<ref>{{cite news\n |title       = \u6703\u8003\u4e2d\u6587\u984c\u592a\u300c\u6f6e\u300d\u8003\u751f\u300cO\u5634\u300d\n |url         = http://hk.news.yahoo.com/080426/60/2t2xr.html\n |publisher   = [[Sing Tao Daily]]\n |date        = 27 April 2008\n |accessdate  = 29 April 2008\n |language    = Chinese\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20080430165911/http://hk.news.yahoo.com/080426/60/2t2xr.html\n |archivedate = 30 April 2008\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}\n</ref>\n\nOn [[YouTube]] and [[Internet forum]]s, ringtones of the recording appeared after the paper, including the imitation of [[Cantopop]] duo [[Twins (group)|Twins]] singing their song, \"Lian Ai Da Guo Tian\" (\u6200\u611b\u5927\u904e\u5929, Love Is More Important Than Anything), and the recording of the Halloween advertisement.\n\nSome candidates also suggested actions to protest the difficulty of the comprehension paper by wearing black clothes and staying on seats after the end of examinations on 2 May and 3 May 2008, when the English Language examinations were held.<ref>{{cite web\n | script-title=zh:\u70ba\u4e86\u5c0d\u8003\u8a55\u5c40\u7684\u4e2d\u6587\u5377\u8868\u9054\u4e0d\u6eff\uff0c\u53c3\u8207\u82f1\u6587\u5377\u4f5c\u7b54\u6642\u6642\u7a7f\u9ed1\u8272\u886b\n | url = https://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=26491791008\n | archive-url = https://archive.is/20121129230813/http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=26491791008\n | url-status = dead\n | archive-date = 29 November 2012\n | work = Facebook\n | accessdate = 29 April 2008\n | language = Chinese\n }} \n</ref>\n\n==Publishing==\nAs a regular practice, the HKEAA published past papers, marking schemes and examination reports every year.

Marking schemes were to be given only to markers.\n\nFrom 2003, the authority issued the examination report and the question papers in year form, which included a question paper, suggested answers (changed to marking schemes from 2005), and candidates' performance and examination statistics; the price ranged from HK$20\u201345.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Education in Hong Kong]]\n* [[HKALE|Hong Kong Advanced Level Examination]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.hkeaa.edu.hk The Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority]\n* [http://www.iiehongkong.org/hked/hkeducation.htm#HKCEE Institute of International Education \u2013 Information on HKCEE]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hong Kong Certificate Of Education Examination}}\n[[Category:School qualifications]]\n[[Category:Standardized tests]]\n[[Category:School examinations in Hong Kong]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{weasel|date=January 2009}}\n{{refimprove|date=January 2009}}\n}}\n{{EngvarB|date=July 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2014}}\n{{Chinese|t=\u9999\u6e2f\u4e2d\u5b78\u6703\u8003|s=\u9999\u6e2f\u4e2d\u5b66\u4f1a\u8003|j=hoeng1 gong2 zung1 hok6 wui6 haau2|p=Xi\u0101ngg\u01ceng Zh\u014dngxu\u00e9 Hu\u00eck\u01ceo}}\n{{Education in Hong Kong}}\nThe ''' Examination System ''' (HKCEE, \u9999\u6e2f\u4e2d\u5b78\u6703\u8003) was a standardised examination between 1974 and 2011 after most local students' five-year secondary education, conducted by the [[Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority]] (HKEAA), awarding the '''Hong Kong Certificate of Education''' secondary [[school leaving qualification]]. The examination has been discontinued in 2012 and its roles are now replaced by the [[Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education]] as part of [[334 Scheme|educational reforms]] in Hong Kong.\n\n== Overview ==\nStudents usually took the HKCEE at the end of their five-year period of secondary school in Hong Kong; it was compulsory for students who wanted to pursue further education, but some students took individual examinations to increase their chance of continuing their study or to fulfil certain requirements in tertiary education programs. \n \nThe final year in which school candidates were accepted was 2010. There were 127,162 candidates entered for the examination, 90,063 of them school candidates and 37,099 private candidates.\n\nThe HKCEE was conducted from late February to June, but major subjects were taken between mid-April and May, after the major subjects examination in the [[Hong Kong Advanced Level Examination]] were completed, by the Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority ([[HKEAA]]). Oral examinations were conducted in late May to early July.\n\nExamination results were released in early August, traditionally on the Wednesday after the first-round admission of the [[Joint University Programmes Admissions System]] had been released. There were 39 subjects available in the HKCEE. Most day-school candidates took 6 to 8 subjects in the HKCEE, with 10 being the upper limit. Apart from Chinese and English, which were taken by almost every school candidate, and language-specific subjects (French, [[Chinese History]] (Chinese only), [[buddhism|Buddhist Studies]] (Chinese only), Literature in English (English only), [[Putonghua]] (Chinese only) and [[Word Processing]] and Business Communication (English only), all subjects could be taken in either Chinese or English. The same standards were applied in marking and grading regardless of the choice of language, and the language medium was not recorded on the results notices or certificates. It was, however, recorded on admission forms.\n\n==Purpose==\nAfter sitting the HKCEE and having their examination results announced, candidates could apply for a place in sixth form in local schools in Hong Kong. Moreover, to qualify for the [[Hong Kong Advanced Level Examination]] (HKALE), students had to pass certain requirements of HKCEE as a prerequisite. The [[Joint University Programmes Admissions System]] (JUPAS), including the [[Early Admissions Scheme (Hong Kong)|EAS system]] under JUPAS, also considered students' HKCEE results as a requirement and as a decisive factor of admission in the admission processes. Thus, students' results in HKCEE affected their application to sixth form but also directly affected the chance of entering the universities after seventh form, which was commonly ignored by students until they entered sixth form. In JUPAS, most admissions programs gave HKCEE results about a 10\u201330% weight, and some as much as 50%; the HKALE results provided the other 50%.<ref>JUPAS Walkthrough 2008, Mingpao Education Net, 2007</ref> Thus, HKCEE was the initial stage of University Entrance Examination.\n\nThe HKCEE was fully recognised by other countries including New Zealand, Australia, the UK, the US and many other major countries. It was equivalent to Year 11 in Australia and in the UK.\n\nFor comparison, the Mathematics syllabus of HKCEE was equivalent to New Zealand's [[National Certificate of Educational Achievement]] Level 2 Mathematics at Form 6 (Year 12) level (excluding Calculus) rather than NCEA Level 1 or its predecessor the [[School Certificate (New Zealand)|School Certificate]] examination, sat by the country's Form 5 (Year 11) students.\n\n[[Additional Mathematics]] in the HKCEE was  more advanced than NCEA Level 3 Mathematics with Calculus, sat by Form 7 (Year 13) students in New Zealand to gain university entrance in science and engineering. HKCEE's Additional Mathematics was also recognised by most of the programs in Hong Kong's universities as equivalent to [[HKALE]] Pure Mathematics.\n\nFor the examination questions on the same topics, those in HKCEE tended to be loaded with unclear wordings and difficult manipulations {{clarify|date=February 2011}}, compared with their NCEA counterparts.\n\nIn other subjects, such as the sciences like [[Chemistry]] and [[Physics]], the syllabus covered in HKCEE was similar to that of the [[SAT Subject Tests]] sat in Grade 12, but it was arguably easier to obtain a score of 760 on the [[SAT Subject Tests]] than to obtain a grade of A in the HKCEE examination although Grade 12 was theoretically equivalent to Form 6 under the Hong Kong school system.\n\n==Grading and UK equivalence==\nThe results of the HKCEE are expressed in terms of seven grades A \u2013 U (or 5*-1 and U for Chinese and English) other than French.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Grade \n! Point(s) \n! Recognition\n!

It means they will have no future and must be beggars.) \n|}\nIn the past, there were two other grades below UNCL: G and H. They were called \"Grenade\" and \"Ladder\".\n\nResults below grade 'F' are designated as unclassified (\"UNCL\"), assigned either when candidates hand in unanswered or unintelligible paper(s), or when candidates are assumed to have cheated. Candidates not taking the exam are designated as Absent ('ABS') for that subject.\n\nBefore 2002 grades A \u2013 F were each divided into two \"fine grades\", making the original number of grades available twelve, from A(01) to F(12). The fine grades in both HKCEE and HKALE were lifted in 2002, as they were accused of being discriminatory to students. {{clarify|date=February 2011}}\n\nMost of the results are graded \"on the curve\" but at the same time a cutoff score for each grade is also used. Obtaining an A is very difficult, especially for languages in the past system, where only about 1.5\u20133% of students received A's. On average, only the top 3\u20134% in each subject can get an A. The cutoff scores vary greatly from subject to subject and from year to year. To give a clearer picture, for Chinese, A-grades are sometimes given for candidates having scored 70 or above, while for Mathematics, an A invariably translates to a score in excess of 90. The cutoff scores are not released by the HKEAA publicly; the information is only available to teachers.\n\nOfficial statistics can be found on the HKEAA website: https://web.archive.org/web/20051124073914/http://www.hkeaa.edu.hk/doc/fd/2004cee/39-60.pdf\n\n=== New Grading System ===\n\nSince 2007, as a steppingstone towards the grading system HKDSE that will be introduced in 2010, a new grading system was introduced to the exams in the subjects of Chinese and English.  Under the new system There are seven grades: five numerical grades from 1\u20135, where 1 is the lowest and 5 is the highest, and two other grades, \"5*\" and \"UNCL\", for students with particularly outstanding and poor performance respectively. The traditional \"on-the-curve\" system was not used other than to distinguish between the 5*'s and the 5's.\n\nThe point system was in chaos in its first year of implementation since level 2, which is the passing line in HKEAA, counts as two points in some schools and the HKEAA, but counts as one point in EMB and most schools. This counting process not only confused Form 5 students, but also some Form 6 students who repeated the exam to obtain better Language results for JUPAS admissions.  The problems with the points system caused changes in the method for calculating points in HKEAA in the following years.\n\nSince the two syllabi in English were merged into one along with the new system, some schools were worried that the level of English is insufficient for the HKALE as they expect HKEAA will decrease the difficulty to allow students who previously studied in Syllabus A(mainly from some non-EMI schools) to pass more easily. This resulted in some schools rejecting students who had a level 2 in English.\n\nThe system will be fully utilised in all major subjects in the HKDSE.\n\n===Further Studies===\n\nStudents' results in HKCEE and their conduct (behavior at school which is usually shown in the school's internal report) at school are the main admission factors in Secondary 6, which is the main stream for university admission. In EMB's official admission processes, students with 4 passed subjects, or 3 passes with 5 marks (both excluding language subjects) is the minimum requirement. Students with 14 marks above, including passes in English and one other Language subject have an advantage as they can be admitted from the first stage of Form 6 admissions. Students scoring 30 marks (the maximum) with L4/C in two designated language subjects (one of which must be English) in their first attempt will be permitted to apply to the [[Early Admissions Scheme (Hong Kong)|Direct Entry]] for the 3 major Universities in Hong Kong (see below). {{clarify|date=February 2011}}\n\nRequirements of sitting in HKALE are independent from Form 6 admissions since they are managed by separate organisations. A student who passes all the minimum requirements for sitting in HKALE also meets all the requirements for applying for Form 6, but not vice versa. Schools may admit a student who failed in language subjects, providing that the school would bear the risk that he/she may not pass again in the following year, not allowing them to sit for the HKALE.\n\nFor admissions to the four-year Higher Diploma programs in [[Hong Kong Institute of Vocational Education|HKIVE]] and degrees in The University of Hong Kong, [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]], and the University of Science and Technology, the best 7 subjects, instead of 6, are counted. In other cases, the best 5 or 6 subjects are counted. The Chinese University of Hong Kong, in addition, did not accept \"combined certificates\" (results obtained in more than two examinations) and must be fulfilled in a single attempt (usually the first one).\n\n===International recognition===\n\nHKEAA has been working closely with international agencies, overseas universities and colleges to promote recognition of HKEAA examinations. Standards of performance in the HKCEE and HKALE have for many years been benchmarked against standards in comparable subjects at British GCE O-Level and A/AS-Level. In the case of performance in the English Language, studies have been conducted to link standards of performance in HKCEE English Language (Syllabus B) and HKALE Use of English to standards in [[IELTS]] and [[TOEFL]].\n\nStarting from 2007, HKCEE standards-referenced reporting was adopted in Chinese language and English language subjects. The results in the two subjects have also been benchmarked against International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE) results.\n\nThe Hong Kong Diploma for Secondary Education Examination (HKDSE) will be conducted for the first time in 2012. To secure appropriate recognition of HKDSE qualifications, the HKEAA has been holding discussions with international agencies including [[University of Cambridge International Examinations]] (CIE), [[National Academic Recognition Information Centre]] (NARIC), [[UCAS|Universities and Colleges Admissions Service]] (UCAS) in the UK and the [[Australian Education International]] (AEI) in Australia to conduct benchmarking and comparability research on HKDSE.\n\nAlthough HKEAA examinations have been widely accepted, some universities have set particular criteria for admission of overseas students. For instance, the [[University of Cambridge]] in the UK has set out admission requirements for under-age or minor candidates concerning guardianship arrangements.\n\nIn cases where candidates wish to further their studies abroad, they may be required to take as one of the basic requirements certain unified examinations conducted by the examination authorities of that particular country. These include, for example, the [[National Higher Education Entrance Examination]] for Universities in Mainland China and the [[SAT]] for the United States.\n\nUK NARIC is the UK's National Agency for the UK Government. They are the official information provider on information on wide-ranging international qualifications and skills attained from outside the UK.\n\nAlthough NARIC is a National Agency for the UK Government, the institutions of higher education may make their own decision on what foreign qualifications or study they will accept, and UK NARIC has only an advisory role.\n\nThe two new HKCEE language subjects have been benchmarked against the International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE) by the Cambridge Assessment. The HKCEE results in Chinese Language and English Language are recognised as equivalent to the IGCSE results as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| HKCEE \n| IGCSE\n|-\n| 5*\n| A* \n|-\n| 5 \n| A \n|- \n| 4\n| B \n|- \n| 3 \n| C \n|- \n|}\n\n==Marking schemes==\nWhile the HKEAA have been publishing booklets of past examination papers of each subject at an affordable price, the marking schemes (i.e. official detailed solutions) of past examinations were never readily available to the public. The official argument from the HKEAA for not publishing these marking schemes was that it might be \"pedagogically unsound\" and would encourage \"rote memorisation\" behaviour from students. Nevertheless, students were often able to obtain these \"restricted documents\" by taking classes at [[Cram schools in Hong Kong|cram schools]]. Hence, the policy of the HKEAA indirectly denied less privileged students from gaining access to information pertaining to how examination papers are scored. This might have created a socio-economic bias in the ability of students to obtain good results in the HKCEE. Moreover, according to media reports, some so-called \"star tutors\" managed to earn more than [[Hong Kong dollar|HK$]]7 million per annum (~[[United States dollar|US$]]900,000), leading some to speculate that the HKEAA's policy had indirectly transferred large amounts of wealth to these cram schools.\n\nTo deal with this problem, the HKEAA started to release the marking schemes together with the year's examination papers in 2003.\n\n==HKSAR Government Scholarship==\nThe HKSAR Government Scholarship is a prestigious award associated with the HKCEE Examination. The top 30\u201340 candidates in the HKCEE Examination receive this scholarship each year. Counterintuitively, many 10A students fail to receive this award. This apparent paradox is mainly due to the methodology in which the HKSAR Government Scholarship is awarded. Rather than calculating the number of A's each student has, the HKSAR Government Scholarship is awarded on the basis of the highest total in raw scores attained in the seven best subjects of each student. Consequently, many 9A, 8A, and even 7A students go on to win this award while 10A students go home empty handed. This has been a major source of complaint {{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} from eager parents of 10A students who felt cheated from this coveted prize.\n\n==Early Admissions Scheme==\n{{main|Early Admissions Scheme (Hong Kong)}}\nThe Early Admissions Scheme (or simply \"EAS\"), a subsystem of the [[Joint University Programmes Admissions System]] (JUPAS) since 2003, allowed school Candidates with 6 or more \"A\"s (Distinctions) on their first attempt of the HKCEE, with level 4 or above in English Language, and also level 4 or above in Chinese Language or \"C\" or above in French or Putonghua to apply for the [[University of Hong Kong]], [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]], or the [[Hong Kong University of Science and Technology]] institutions after their Secondary 6 study, without the need to sit for the HKALE.\n\nEach year about 400\u2013600 students entered the scheme via this subsystem in JUPAS. A selection procedure exists in this scheme but, unlike the mainstream scheme of JUPAS, the students are guaranteed a firm offer in EAS regardless of the number of applicants in EAS. Students who met the EAS requirements do not need to apply for this scheme to enter the aforementioned universities (though most of them will), but they need to take part in the HKALE and participate in the mainstream scheme if they did not participate and want to pursue their studies in Hong Kong.\n\nThere are also rare cases where students who were eligible for the EAS are given independent offers by universities outside EAS.\n\n==List of subjects==\nSubjects in bold are the major examination subjects (which over 20% of students sit); most secondary schools will provide these curricula for students.\n\n*Accommodation and Catering Services <sup>2</sup>\n*'''[[Additional Mathematics]]'''\n*'''Biology'''\n*Buddhist Studies <sup>1</sup>\n*'''Chemistry'''\n*'''Chinese History'''\n*'''Chinese Language'''\n*Chinese Literature\n*'''Commerce'''\n*'''Computer and Information Technology'''\n*Design and Technology <sup>5</sup>\n*Design and Technology (Alternative Syllabus) <sup>5</sup>\n*Economic and Public Affairs <sup>3</sup>\n*'''Economics <sup>3</sup>'''\n*Electronics and Electricity\n*'''English Language'''\n*Fashion and Clothing <sup>4</sup>\n*French\n*'''Geography'''\n*Government and Public Affairs\n*Graphical Communication\n*'''History'''\n*Home Economics (Dress and Design) <sup>4</sup>\n*Home Economics (Food, Home and Family) <sup>2</sup>\n*Integrated Humanities\n*Literature in English\n*'''Mathematics'''\n*Music\n*Physical Education\n*'''Physics'''\n*'''Principles of Accounts'''\n*Putonghua\n*Religious Studies <sup>1</sup>\n*Science and Technology\n*Social Studies\n*Technological Studies <sup>5</sup>\n*Travel and Tourism\n*Visual Art\n*Word Processing and Business Communication (English)\n\n# Buddhist Studies may not be taken with Religious studies; Religious Studies are available in Protestant and Catholic versions on the same paper, which varies in the citations of the Bible.

Starting from 2006, two subjects\u2014Chinese History and History\u2014have been implented with the school-based assessment, replacing the previous multiple choice paper in public examinations.\n\nOwing to the transition from the seven-year curriculum (five years of secondary and two years of [[sixth form]] / matriculation) to a six-year curriculum of secondary education, the HKCEE and the [[HKALE]] will be phased out and replaced with a new examination, the [[Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education]] Examination (HKDSE).\n\nIn 2007, the curricula for Chinese and English were revised. The two subjects were no longer graded along the [[normal distribution]] curve but rather by criteria referencing (with the exception of the highest grade, the 5*). Numerical levels are used instead of the traditional letter grades.\n\nThe proposed revisions specific to Chinese include:\n*The removal of the 26 selected essays, excerpts from the classics, poems and ancient lyrics in the original curriculum, replacing them with a selection of reading materials by the teachers.\n*Independent reading comprehension and writing papers.\n*The addition of a listening comprehension examination.\n*The addition of a speaking (oral) examination.\n*The addition of a paper testing integrated skills.\n*The addition of a [[school-based assessment]] (SBA) scheme that accounts for 20% of the exam mark.\n\nThe proposed revisions specific to English include:\n*The abolishment of two separate syllabi. Before 2007, two syllabi coexisted. Syllabus B was an [[O-level]] course and Syllabus A was easier but inferior. For HKEAA/EMB's view, grades attained on syllabus A were considered to be inferior to grades attained on syllabus B (e.g. a C on syllabus A was equivalent to an E on syllabus B), except in Form 6 admission and HKALE requirements in which the two syllabi were considered the same.\n**However, many universities and secondary schools claimed that the gap should have been larger. According to the report by HKEAA comparing the student's Use of English in HKALE with their previous result in HKCEE English, the passing rate of use of English for which candidates received a C on syllabus A is far lower than that of candidates who received an E in syllabus B.\n*The abolishment of the testing of grammar and language usage which was once part of the old reading comprehension and usage paper. (Grammar will be tested alongside comprehension in the same section)\n*A refined writing paper, now requiring two separate pieces of writing, one guided, one independent and more open-ended.\n*A refined reading comprehension paper, with questions requiring written answers instead of the old format in which every question was a multiple choice question.\n*A refined speaking skills paper, requiring more independent thinking than the previous routinised paper.\n*The addition of a school-based assessment scheme that accounts for 15% of the exam mark.\n\nHKEAA had also announced that candidates who sat in the 2006 exam who wished to retake Chinese or English subjects were to take the new syllabi. It is questionable whether those candidates, who were used to the old syllabi, could adapt to the structure of the new syllabi in nearly half a year.\n\n==Controversies==\n===1997 HKEA Senior Subject Officer Assisted his Son to Achieve 8As by Stealing Examination Papers and Marking Schemes===\n\nThe HKEA received reports from several examiners that a candidate, whose academic performance at school was poor, scored almost full marks in every paper he sat. His answers were identical to those in the marking schemes. The HKEAA suspected that someone had obtained the question papers and marking schemes in advance of the examinations in breach of the regulations. The case was referred to the [[ICAC]] for investigation and the candidate's results were withheld pending the outcome of the investigation. It transpired that the candidate's father was Mak Cheung Wah, then an assistant senior subject panel of the HKEA and was in possession of the keys to the safe deposit. Mak used the key to open the safe deposit and took away copies of question papers and marking schemes in every subject for his son to read prior to the examinations. Mak's son memorised the answers and wrote them on the answer scripts to score high marks. The ICAC only managed to solve the case moments before the release of the results. Mak's son was disqualified and his 8A results were annulled. Mak was found guilty of [[theft]] and [[misfeasance in public office]] and was ordered by the [[District Court]] to do 240 hours of [[community service]].\nHe was also dismissed by the HKEA and lost his pension of HK$1.1 million. Since then, the HKEA and the ICAC reviewed the security arrangements of examination documents. Now the HKEAA only produces the marking schemes after the examinations have taken place. <ref>\u300aHong Kong Certificate of Education Examination Annual Report 1997\u300b\uff0cHong Kong\uff1aHong Kong Examinations Authority\uff0c1997\u3002</ref> <ref>\u300aWen Wei Po\u300b\uff0cHong Kong\uff0c6 May 2005. </ref>\n\n===2005 English Language (Syllabus B) grading error===\nIn 2005, the oral component of the Syllabus B English language examination was incorrectly added to the total score because of a recent upgrade to the HKEAA computer system, and the supervisor in charge failed to double-check the results. Subsequently, many candidates received an incorrect total score, which resulted in an incorrect final grade for the subject. The problem was so severe that some students wrongfully received an F grade (the second-lowest grade) when they were supposed to receive an A (the highest grade) in the oral section. Since the final English mark is calculated by averaging the marks in the oral, reading comprehension, listening, and writing sections, having an F in oral would have seriously affected the final English mark if the candidate did well in other components.\n\nIn an attempt to mitigate the situation, the HKEAA publicly apologised and offered free rechecks on the oral component of the English language subject for all candidates. Candidates who would have had a higher score if the error had not occurred received an upgrade. In total, the error affected 670 candidates, and 422 candidates had their oral component mark upgraded while 248 had their overall English subject grade upgraded. The cascade reaction affected 233 candidates who were eligible for sixth form.\n\nHowever, the mistake was discovered far too late. It was discovered when the admissions process was almost over. Since some candidates were unable to find a school for their matriculate education because they received an incorrect grade, the [[Education and Manpower Bureau]] was forced to increase the school quotas for some schools to accommodate the affected students. HKEAA chairman Irving Koo assured the students that their education would not be affected by the error.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/stdn/std/Metro/GH13Ak01.html |title=Exams body in another blunder |first=Chester |last=Yung |publisher=[[The Standard (Hong Kong)|The Standard]] |date=13 August 2005 |accessdate=14 April 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090404031739/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/stdn/std/Metro/GH13Ak01.html |archivedate=4 April 2009 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n===2005 English Language (Syllabus B) incident===\nA proofreading exercise in Paper 2 of the HKCEE English Language (Syllabus B) quoted a message that was adapted from an online forum. Some students flamed on that forum in anger after the exam. That caused the HKEAA to hold several internal meetings banning the use of messages from the online forum.\n\n===2006 English Language (Syllabus B) paper 2 incident===\nThe HKCEE English Language (Syllabus B) 2006, the last year for the syllabus, was administered on 4 May 2006. Paper 2, Reading Comprehension and Usage, had some candidates complained that the HKEAA, in providing all of the study sources via the Internet, created the potential for candidates to access the solutions with electronic devices such as [[personal digital assistant]]s and cellphones while they were in the toilet. The rumour was first spread on local forums and [https://web.archive.org/web/20060402230455/http://ufhks.com/ Young-M]. The incident generated widespread public furore.\n\nNumerous discussions were initiated on local forums. Candidates sitting for the paper demanded a retake of the paper and an apology from the HKEAA. Some candidates collaborated with political parties to hold protests against the HKEAA's decision to not readminister the paper. A [https://web.archive.org/web/20060621223158/http://ufhks.com/main/na3/memo.php?bd=hkeaa&&no=9&re=0 protest (Cantonese)] was proposed for 31 May or 1 July.\n\nOn [http://forum.uwants.com/viewthread.php?tid=2140003 a local forum], a candidate threatened to sue the HKEAA by saying that justice needed to be defended. More than 100 complaints were received by the HKEAA regarding the incident.\n\nThe actual articles used in the exam:\n*[https://www.usatoday.com/life/2001-08-31-parapara.htm], an article on the [[Para Para]] scene in Hong Kong, published by ''[[USA Today]]'' on 31 August 2001.\n*[http://www.stoptextbully.com], a website about [[cyberbullying]], had numerous grammatical and structural mistakes.\n\n===2007 Chinese Language paper 2 incident===\nIn 2007 HKCEE Chinese Language Paper 2 (Writing), Question 2 'Lemon Tea' was suspected to be leaked beforehand since a tutor, [[Siu Yuen]] from [[King's Glory Education Centre]] gave his students a sample article of a similar title, 'Iced Lemon Tea', well before the exam. That led to assumption that the tutor had knowledge of the question in the actual exam.\n\nTwo students lodged a complaint to the. A spokesperson of the HKEAA stated that copying by candidates will result in no marks given to the plagiarised parts.\n\n===2007 English Language questions leakage incident===\nBefore the examination date of English Language Papers in 2007, \"Mr. Ken\", one of the well-known tutors at the Modern Education Centre in Hong Kong, called his students back to the tutorial centre for a few days before the test to review some material on fashion. It was later found that the actual test had some of the same topics and even some questions identical that were identical, fuelling worries of a possible leakage.\n\n===2008 Chinese Language incident===\nControversies were in two papers: paper 1, comprehension, and paper 5, integrated skills.\n\nIn paper 1, the format in previous years was that two passages were supplied, one in [[Vernacular Chinese]] and one in [[Classical Chinese]], and candidates were required to answer questions mainly in words. In 2008, however, the second passage was a [[Chinese poetry|Chinese poem]] instead. Also, half of the total scores were from [[multiple choice]] questions, and in some questions, choices were said to be difficult to distinguish. For example, in question 5, the four choices were \"believable\" (\u53ef\u4ee5\u76f8\u4fe1), \"affirmative\" (\u80af\u5b9a\u7684\u662f), \"proved by facts\" (\u4e8b\u5be6\u8b49\u660e) and \"undeniable\" (\u7121\u53ef\u5426\u8a8d). Some teachers said that they could not even make the relevant decisions in a short period of time or said that the paper required deduction skills and common sense rather than Chinese knowledge, and some candidates said the paper was more like gambling than an examination. Some also commented that the passages were too difficult for CE level. Even a university professor admitted that he could not finish the exam in a reasonable amount of time. The first Vernacular Chinese passage was said to be of the difficulty of Form 7 [[Hong Kong Advanced Level Examination|Advanced Level Examination]] Chinese Language and Culture, and the second poem, [[Moonlight of Spring River]] (\u6625\u6c5f\u82b1\u6708\u591c) in [[Tang Dynasty]], was said to be of the difficulty of university Chinese.<ref>{{cite news\n |script-title = zh:\u300c\u596a\u547d\u56db\u5f0f\u300d\u8003\u8d77\u6703\u8003\u751f\n |url          = http://hk.news.yahoo.com/080425/60/2t27i.html\n |publisher    = [[Sing Tao Daily]]\n |date         = 26 April 2008\n |accessdate   = 29 April 2008\n |language     = Chinese\n |url-status      = dead\n |archiveurl   = https://web.archive.org/web/20080428204826/http://hk.news.yahoo.com/080425/60/2t27i.html\n |archivedate  = 28 April 2008\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}</ref> the HKESA replied that papers can be set in any format and style.\n\nIn paper 5, candidates were required to listen to a recording and do various tasks, but both the recording and the data file were criticised. A [[Halloween]] advertisement was included in the recording, and some candidates afterward said that they felt uneasy or thought the radio channel was switched. In the data file, Chinese slang terms were discussed in an extract from a newspaper article and in a poster promoting reading. Some teachers and students criticised the materials for promoting slang terms, some students said that they had not heard of such terms and others said that the HKEAA had misconceptions about the use of the slang terms. The Authority responded that, as is the norm, some of the materials provided were deliberately false or worthless to promote critical thinking and choice-taking by students.<ref>{{cite news\n |title       = \u6703\u8003\u4e2d\u6587\u984c\u592a\u300c\u6f6e\u300d\u8003\u751f\u300cO\u5634\u300d\n |url         = http://hk.news.yahoo.com/080426/60/2t2xr.html\n |publisher   = [[Sing Tao Daily]]\n |date        = 27 April 2008\n |accessdate  = 29 April 2008\n |language    = Chinese\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20080430165911/http://hk.news.yahoo.com/080426/60/2t2xr.html\n |archivedate = 30 April 2008\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}\n</ref>\n\nOn [[YouTube]] and [[Internet forum]]s, ringtones of the recording appeared after the paper, including the imitation of [[Cantopop]] duo [[Twins (group)|Twins]] singing their song, \"Lian Ai Da Guo Tian\" (\u6200\u611b\u5927\u904e\u5929, Love Is More Important Than Anything), and the recording of the Halloween advertisement.\n\nSome candidates also suggested actions to protest the difficulty of the comprehension paper by wearing black clothes and staying on seats after the end of examinations on 2 May and 3 May 2008, when the English Language examinations were held.<ref>{{cite web\n | script-title=zh:\u70ba\u4e86\u5c0d\u8003\u8a55\u5c40\u7684\u4e2d\u6587\u5377\u8868\u9054\u4e0d\u6eff\uff0c\u53c3\u8207\u82f1\u6587\u5377\u4f5c\u7b54\u6642\u6642\u7a7f\u9ed1\u8272\u886b\n | url = https://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=26491791008\n | archive-url = https://archive.is/20121129230813/http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=26491791008\n | url-status = dead\n | archive-date = 29 November 2012\n | work = Facebook\n | accessdate = 29 April 2008\n | language = Chinese\n }} \n</ref>\n\n==Publishing==\nAs a regular practice, the HKEAA published past papers, marking schemes and examination reports every year.

It was first mentioned in a letter from the Count Heinrich zu Stolberg to Dietrich von Witzlebenon on 3 November 1487. The establishment of the village took place around the market. The first silver mines are assumed to be the St. Andrews Cross Mine ({{lang-de|Grube St. Andreaskreuz}}) at the foot of the ''Beerberg'' and the St. Andrews Mine (''Grube St. Andreas'') by the market. In 1521, St. Andreasberg received the right to mine from Counts Heinrich and Ernst von Hohenstein.
