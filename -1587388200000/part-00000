Before this incident, there were various other episodes in which Norwalk was mocked: The characters refused to swim in a Norwalk swimming pool, acting like the pool water was diseased because of Norwalk people; one of the children took bets on how many of the girlfriends of Norwalk\u2019s basketball team would be pregnant post season; and Oliver Otto used a neighbor's Hispanic housekeeper to alter flawed Polo shirts and sell them to Norwalk students, believing that no Westport resident would buy them; Oliver ended up earning a lot of money. This brought condemnation from residents, school officials, and politicians of Norwalk.

Compared to the other residents who own big houses, Katie and her family are renters of a more modest home. She lives with Greg, her level-headed husband who is a university professor of history, and their three children. Taylor is their athletic, headstrong, but somewhat dimwitted oldest daughter who wants to fit in with her peers; Oliver, their savvy, ambitious, and snarky son, is the middle child; and Anna-Kat, sweet but obsessive-compulsive, is the youngest and Katie's blatant favorite. Katie frequently vents her frustration to and seeks advice from her two closest friends: Doris, whose strict parenting style sharply contrasts with Katie's; and Angela, a divorced lesbian mother and lawyer with a calm parenting style.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of American Housewife episodes}}\n{{:List of American Housewife episodes}}\n\n==Cast and characters==\n\n===Main===\n* [[Katy Mixon]] as Kate \"Katie\" Otto\n* [[Diedrich Bader]] as Greg Otto, Katie's husband\n* [[Meg Donnelly]] as Taylor \u201cSweetheart\u201d Otto, Katie and Greg's teenage daughter; <small>the role was portrayed by [[Johnny Sequoyah]] in the televised pilot<!-- SHE WAS CREDITED AS MAIN CAST IN THE PILOT --></small><ref name=\"DonnellyRecasting\">{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2016/07/american-housewife-meg-donnelly-cast-abc-comedy-recasting-1201793752/ |title='American Housewife': Meg Donnelly Added To New ABC Comedy In Recasting |last=Petski |first=Denise |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=July 27, 2016 |accessdate=September 9, 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Daniel DiMaggio]] as Oliver Otto, Katie and Greg's teenage son and middle child\n* [[Julia Butters]] as Anna-Kat Otto, Katie and Greg's youngest daughter\n* [[Ali Wong]] as Doris, one of Katie's best friends\n* Carly Hughes as Angela, one of Katie's best friends\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[Leslie Bibb]] as Viv, Katy's neighbor who was originally introduced as Two-Fitbit Lady\n* [[Jessica St. Clair]] as Chloe Brown Mueller, Katie's arch nemesis\n* [[Wendie Malick]] as Kathryn, Katie's mother\n* Logan Pepper as Cooper Bradford, Oliver's uber-wealthy best friend whose parents are almost always out of town; Cooper adores Katie as a mother figure\n* Amarr M.

Before this incident, there were various other episodes in which Norwalk was mocked: The characters refused to swim in a Norwalk swimming pool, acting like the pool water was diseased because of Norwalk people; one of the children took bets on how many of the girlfriends of Norwalk\u2019s basketball team would be pregnant post season; and Oliver Otto used a neighbor's Hispanic housekeeper to alter flawed Polo shirts and sell them to Norwalk students, believing that no Westport resident would buy them; Oliver ended up earning a lot of money.

We\u2019ve heard the concerns of the people of Norwalk and have made the decision to omit any mentions of the city from future episodes\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thehour.com/news/article/American-Housewife-to-omit-Norwalk-from-future-12390310.php|title=Following outcry, \"American Housewife\" to omit Norwalk from future episodes|author=Kaitlyn Krasselt|date=29 November 2017|accessdate=30 November 2017|newspaper=[[The Hour (newspaper)|The Hour]]}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- Per [[WP:ELMINOFFICIAL]], choose one official website only -->\n* {{Official website|http://abc.go.com/shows/american-housewife}}\n* {{IMDb title|5396394}}\n\n{{ABCNetwork Shows (current and upcoming)}}\n\n[[Category:2010s American single-camera sitcoms]]\n[[Category:2020s American single-camera sitcoms]]\n[[Category:2010s American LGBT-related comedy television series]]\n[[Category:2020s American LGBT-related comedy television series]]\n[[Category:2016 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:American Broadcasting Company original programming]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:American LGBT-related sitcoms]]\n[[Category:Television production suspended due to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]]\n[[Category:Television series about families]]\n[[Category:Television series by ABC Studios]]\n[[Category:Television shows set in Connecticut]]\n", "name_user": "Transphasic", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCast and characters", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Housewife"}
