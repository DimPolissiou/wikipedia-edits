His mother was Sarah Wheeler, daughter of [[Jonas Wheeler (bishop)|Jonas Wheeler]], [[Bishop of Ossory]] and his wife Martha Tucker; Sarah was  the widow of Mathew Tyrrell.\n\nHe graduated from [[Trinity College Dublin]] in 1666. Although he had originally intended to become a soldier, he later  resolved on a legal career instead, and entered [[Middle Temple]] in 1669. He seems to have been  an exceptionally unruly student: he  was fined for breaking down  the doors and for gambling at Christmas.\n\nHe was called to the [[Irish Bar]] about 1672 and became Commissioner of Revenue Appeals in 1677. After the [[Glorious Revolution|Revolution of 1688]] he lived for a time in England.\n\nHe was appointed [[Serjeant-at-law (Ireland)|Prime Serjeant]] on 29 December 1692 and represented the borough of [[Galway Borough (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Galway]] in the [[Irish House of Commons]] from 1692 to 1693. In 1693 he was  made [[Recorder of Dublin]].\n\n==Judge==\n\nHe was raised to the  High Court bench as a Puisne Baron of the Irish [[Exchequer of Ireland|Court of Exchequer]] in 1695, and on 31 December 1696 was made  one of the Commissioners of the [[Great Seal of the Realm|Great Seal of Ireland]], pending the appointment of [[John Methuen (diplomat)|John Methuen]] as [[Lord Chancellor of Ireland]] in 1697. He became [[Chief Baron of the Exchequer (Ireland)|Chief Baron of the Exchequer]] on 27 December 1703, holding the office until his death. His elevation to the Bench was said to be part of an effort to remove judges  who were suspected of [[Tory]] or pro-Catholic views; but it is   surprising that Donnellan, who was a descendant of an Old Irish, [[Irish language|Gaelic]]-speaking family which had several  [[Roman Catholic]] members, was not suspected of   Catholic and Tory sympathies himself.\n\nIn 1698 the Irish born writer and publisher [[John Dunton]], on a visit to Dublin, gave a favourable verdict on the Irish judiciary, including Donnellan: \"men whose reputation is such that no one complains of them\".\n\n==Family==\n\nHe married twice; little is known of his first wife, who died before 1688, leaving one surviving son, James. He remarried Martha Ussher, daughter of Christopher Ussher, who outlived him by many years, and married secondly Phillip Perceval, brother of the 1st [[Earl of Egmont]]. Nehemiah and Martha had two sons, Nehemiah, MP for [[Tipperary (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Tipperary]], and Christopher, and two daughters, Katherine and [[Anne Donnellan|Anne]] (died 1762).\n\nHis daughter Anne is remembered today as the friend of most of the leading Irish writers of her time, and for founding the Donnellan Lectures at Trinity College Dublin. Her sister Katherine married [[Robert Clayton (bishop)|Robert Clayton]], [[Bishop of Cork and Ross]]. The artist and letter writer [[Mary Delaney]] wrote an unflattering sketch of Katherine  as \"giving herself the airs of a Queen\" after her husband was made a bishop. She may well have come to regret his promotion, as his religious opinions were so unorthodox as to raise doubts as to whether he was a [[Christians|Christian]] at all. [[Horace Walpole]] said unkindly that Clayton's  writings seemed calculated to destroy anyone's  Christian faith, and it seems that only his sudden death in 1758  averted an inquiry by his fellow bishops into charges of [[heresy]] against him.\n\n[[File:Robert and Katherine Clayton.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Robert Clayton and his wife Katherine, daughter of Nehemiah Donnellan]]\n\n==References==\n* Ball, Francis Elrington   ''The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921''  John Murray London 1926\n* Joseph Haydn and Horace Ockerby, ''The Book of Dignities'', 3rd edition, London 1894 (reprinted Bath 1969)\n* Gerard, Frances  ''Picturesque Dublin Old and New'' Hutchinson and Co London 1898\n* http://www.leighrayment.com/commons/irelandcommons.htm\n* http://www.ballyd.com/history/baron.html\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Donnellan, Nehemiah}}\n[[Category:1649 births]]\n[[Category:1705 deaths]]\n[[Category:Irish MPs 1692\u20131693]]\n[[Category:Lawyers from Dublin (city)]]\n[[Category:People from County Galway]]\n[[Category:Members of the Middle Temple]]\n[[Category:Chief Barons of the Irish Exchequer]]\n[[Category:Recorders of Dublin]]\n[[Category:Members of the Parliament of Ireland (pre-1801) for County Galway constituencies]]\n[[Category:Serjeants-at-law (Ireland)]]\n", "text_old": "{{other uses|Nehemiah Donnellan (disambiguation)}}\n{{short description|Irish judge}}\n\n'''Nehemiah Donnellan''' (1649 &ndash; 25 December 1705) was an Irish lawyer and [[judge]].\n\n==Early life==\n\nHe was the son of Sir [[James Donnellan]], [[Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas]],   and grandson of [[Nehemiah Donnellan]], [[Archbishop of Tuam]] and Elizabeth O'Donnell.

{"title_page": "The Parent Trap (film series)", "text_new": "{{italic title}}\n'''''The Parent Trap''''' is a [[film series]] produced by [[Walt Disney Pictures]], originating in 1961 with [[Hayley Mills]]. She played both roles of [[The Twins (The Parent Trap)|twin sisters]] who were raised separately by divorced parents, without any knowledge of each other. They meet at a summer holiday camp, and switch places so that they can each meet their other parent. Mills reprised her roles three times in subsequent [[Television film|made-for-television]] sequels. \n\nA [[The Parent Trap (1998 film)|remake]] was released in 1998, with a plot similar to the original film and written by the original film's writer/director [[David Swift (director)|David Swift]], with segments of the story being reworked into a [[Romance film|romantic]]-[[Comedy film|comedy]]. The twins were portrayed by [[Lindsay Lohan]].\n\n==Films==\n===''The Parent Trap'' (1961)===\n{{Main|The Parent Trap (1961 film)}}\n''The Parent Trap'' was written and directed by [[David Swift (director)|David Swift]] for [[Walt Disney Pictures]] released in 1961.

The film stars [[Hayley Mills]] who plays the roles of the thirteen-year-old twin girls, Sharon and Susan. [[Maureen O'Hara]] and [[Brian Keith]] play the twins\u2019 parents, Maggie and Mitch. The film is about the two girls who meet at a summer camp as strangers and realize that they are identical twins. They switch places so that each can meet the other parent, and they plan to bring their divorced parents back together. Soon after switching, the twins learn that there is a new woman, named Vicky Robinson (played by [[Joanna Barnes]]), in their father's life. After Mitch tells Sharon about his engagement to Vicky, the girls come up with a new game plan to get rid of the woman who threatens their plan to reconnect their parents.<ref>''The Parent Trap.''

It was directed by [[Ronald F. Maxwell]]. The film is a continuation of the Walt Disney film ''The Parent Trap''. ''The Parent Trap II'' was filmed twenty-five years after the original film. The idea of a second film was announced in 1985. The only actor who returned from the original film, Hayley Mills, continues to portray the twins, Sharon and Susan. ''The Parent Trap II'' focuses on Sharon's daughter Nikki who tries to set up her mother with her best friend's father, portrayed by [[Tom Skerritt]]. All the music was composed by [[Charles Fox (composer)|Charles Fox]] as well as the title song \"Lets Keep What We Got\" was performed by [[Marilyn McCoo]].\n\n===''Parent Trap III'' (1989)===\n\n{{Main|Parent Trap III}}\n''The Parent Trap II'' was such a success for the Disney Channel that it spawned another made-for-television sequel, ''Parent Trap III'', in 1989.

The remake caught the attention of audiences when it premiered on July 29, 1998. The parents of the twins, Nick Parker (played by [[Dennis Quaid]]) and Elizabeth James (played by [[Natasha Richardson]]), marry on a cruise ship and quickly figure out their lives are in two separate places. They each take one of the twins and then go their separate ways. Eleven years pass and the identical twins, Annie James and Hallie Parker, embark on their summer journeys not knowing each other. The initial rivalry between them turns out to bring them closer and they realize that they must be sisters. Their new goal is to make their parents fall in love again before their father and his fianc\u00e9 Meredeth Blake (played by [[Elaine Hendrix]]) marry.

Fylde|Fylde]]. Born in [[Tallaght]], Ireland he began his career with [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] but failed to make the transition to the first team, spending time on loan at [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]], [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]], [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]], [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] and [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]]. On leaving Spurs he returned on a permanent deal to Colchester before spells with [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]], [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] and [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]]. He has three under-21 [[cap (sport)|caps]] for the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]].\n\n==Career==\n\n===Tottenham Hotspur===\nYeates started his career at [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], but first played professional football in loan spells with [[Brighton and Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]] and [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] during the [[2003\u201304 in English football|2003\u201304]] season. Loaned to Swindon as part of the transfer to Spurs of Swindon player [[Leigh Mills]], Yeates only played four games before being returned to [[White Hart Lane]] after a disagreement with then manager [[Andy King (footballer born 1956)|Andy King]]. He made his Spurs debut against [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolves]] on the final day of the 2003\u201304 [[Premier League]] season, setting up a goal for [[Robbie Keane]]. He made three first team appearances for Spurs.\n\nDuring the [[2005\u201306 in English football|2005\u201306]] season, Yeates played on long term loan at [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]], scoring five league goals, as they achieved promotion from [[Football League One|League One]].\n\nPrior to [[2006\u201307 in English football|2006\u201307]] Yeates signed a two-year contract extension with Spurs. He joined [[Football League Championship|Championship]] team [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] on a season-long loan, but hardly featured for them before returning to his parent club midway through the season.\n\nHe then signed a loan contract until the end of the 2006\u201307 season with another Championship side, [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]]. He scored on his Leicester d\u00e9but at the [[Walkers Stadium]] in a 1\u20131 draw with [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/6305251.stm|title=Leicester 1\u20131 Luton|publisher=BBC Sport|date=3 February 2007|accessdate=1 May 2010}}</ref> On 25 April 2007, having only featured 16 times for Leicester, and not once under [[caretaker manager]] [[Nigel Worthington]], he was allowed to return to Spurs after being deemed surplus to requirements.\n\n===Colchester United===\nOn 3 July 2007 he completed a permanent move to [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]].<ref name=\"Colchester sign Platt and Yeates\">{{cite news|title=Colchester sign Platt and Yeates|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/colchester_united/6250222.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=3 July 2007|accessdate=26 June 2009}}</ref> Yeates was set to sign for Crystal Palace Football Club, but due to the fact that he failed his medical, the transfer was abandoned.

The depiction contains the message '''[[Jesus I trust in you]]''' ([[Polish language|Polish]]: ''Jezu ufam Tobie''). The rays streaming out have symbolic meaning: red for the [[Blood of Christ|blood of Jesus]] (which is the [[Life of Soul]]s), and pale for the water (which [[Justification (theology)|justifies]] souls) (''[[Diary]]'' 299). The whole image is a symbol of [[Charity (virtue)|charity]], [[forgiveness]] and [[love]] of [[God]], referred to as the \"Fountain of [[Mercy]]\".

Sopocko was a professor of theology at the [[University of Vilnius]] and introduced Faustina to Kazimirowski, who was a professor of art there and had painted other religious images. Faustina gave Kazimirowski specific instructions about the appearance and posture of the image, which she said she had received from Jesus Christ in a vision. Sopocko himself posed as Jesus for the image, wearing an [[alb]], and both he and Faustina regularly visited the painter\u2018s workshop. The final painting satisfied neither Sopocko nor Faustina, who later wrote that Jesus told her it was not that important that the picture be beautiful, and that the true beauty would be the blessing he would bestow upon people by means of the painting.<ref name=divinemercyfilm>{{cite AV media | people=DiSilva, Daniel (Director) | date=2016-03-23 | title=The Original Image of Divine Mercy | medium=Motion picture | location=USA | publisher=Springtime Productions}}</ref>\n\nAfter its completion in 1934, the Kazimirowski painting first hung in the [[Franciscans|Bernardine Sisters']] [[convent]] near the [[Church of St. Michael, Vilnius|church of St. Michael]], where Sopo\u0107ko was a rector. In her diary, Faustina wrote that Jesus told her to inform her confessor that the proper place for the painting was in a church, not in the hallway of a convent. The first public exposition of the Kazimirowski painting was on 26\u201328 April 1935, at the Church of the [[Gate of Dawn]] in Vilnius.<ref name=Drake85/>  In 1937, on the Sunday after Easter (later instituted as Divine Mercy Sunday by Pope John Paul II), the painting was put on display beside the main altar in [[Church of St. Michael, Vilnius|St. Michael\u2019s Church in Vilnius]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.piligrimukelias.lt/index.php?id=122&lng=1|title=Jono Pauliaus II piligrim\u0173 kelias.

The painting remained in the disused church building until 1951, when two pious women from Vilnius, Bron\u0117 Miniotait\u0117 and Janina Rodzevi\u010d, bought the canvas from a guard and concealed it in an attic for several years. Later, they gave it to the parish priest at the [[Dominican Church of the Holy Spirit]] for safekeeping, who chose not to display it in the church. Fr. Sopocko, who had relocated to Poland but was unable to take the painting with him, expressed concern about it to his friend Fr. J\u00f3zef Grasewicz, who obtained the painting and moved it to his own parish church in Nova Ruda, [[Belarus]]. There, it was displayed and venerated by the local parishioners. In 1970, the Soviets closed that church and used it as a storage warehouse, but left the painting hanging in the disused church, where parishioners continued to venerate it in secret. In 1986, Fr. Grasewicz arranged for the painting to be replaced by a copy and the original to be secretly transported back to the Church of the Holy Spirit in Vilnius, where it underwent a restoration that significantly changed its appearance and was then displayed and venerated in the church. In 2003, the painting, which had deteriorated due to exposure, attempts at cleaning, and the previous restoration, was professionally restored to its original look. In 2005 it was moved to its current location above the main altar in the [[Sanctuary of the Divine Mercy, Vilnius|Sanctuary of Divine Mercy]] in Vilnius.<ref name=divinemercyfilm /><ref name=historyoffirstimage />\n\nIn 2016, a documentary film, entitled ''The Original Image of Divine Mercy'', was released that told the story of the original Divine Mercy painting and its survival over the decades. Made with the cooperation of the [[Archdiocese of Vilnius]], the film included interviews with [[Jim Gaffigan]], [[Robert Barron|Bishop Robert Barron]], [[Harry Connick Jr.]], and [[Gintaras Grusas|Archbishop Gintaras Grusas]], who also served as executive producer.<ref name=divinemercyfilm /> \n\n=== Hy\u0142a painting ===\nAnother painting of the Divine Mercy was made by [[Adolf Hy\u0142a]], as a [[Ex-voto|votive offering]]. Through painting this picture, Hy\u0142a expressed his gratitude for the survival of his family during [[World War II]].\n\nHy\u0142a was given the descriptions from Faustina's diary by the nuns at the convent, and a small copy of the first painting. Hy\u0142a's image is somewhat different from Kazimirowski's, as the former figured Jesus as a \"Divine Physician\", walking the earth and healing people. He has Jesus approaching the viewer instead of merely standing. Christ's right hand is lifted up high in benediction, and He is looking into the eyes of the viewer. The original version of this painting had a country landscape in the background, which was removed in a later replica as it was deemed \"non-liturgical\".\n\nThe Hy\u0142a rendition is also called the \"Krak\u00f3w Divine Mercy Image\" because it is kept in the sanctuary at [[\u0141agiewniki-Borek Fa\u0142\u0119cki|Krak\u00f3w-\u0141agiewniki]].\n\n===Other versions===\n[[File:Divine Mercy Christ - 1.JPG|thumb|Statue of Merciful Jesus in [[Divine Mercy Shrine (Misamis Oriental)]]]]\nBefore Adolf Hy\u0142a offered his votive painting, the sisters had commissioned [[Stanis\u0142aw Kaczor-Batowski|Stanis\u0142aw Batowski]] to paint a third version. This was lost in a fire, and Batowski painted a fourth painting which arrived at the convent at almost the same time as Hy\u0142a's.

Sopocko was a professor of theology at the [[University of Vilnius]] and introduced Faustina to Kazimirowski, who was a professor of art there and had painted other religious images. Faustina gave Kazimirowski specific instructions about the appearance and posture of the image, which she said she had received from Jesus Christ in a vision. Sopocko himself posed as Jesus for the image, wearing an [[alb]], and both he and Faustina regularly visited the painter\u2018s workshop. The final painting satisfied neither Sopocko nor Faustina, who later wrote that Jesus told her it was not that important that the picture be beautiful, and that the true beauty would be the blessing he would bestow upon people by means of the painting.<ref name=divinemercyfilm>{{cite AV media | people=DiSilva, Daniel (Director) | date=2016-03-23 | title=The Original Image of Divine Mercy | medium=Motion picture | location=USA | publisher=Springtime Productions}}</ref>\n\nAfter its completion in 1934, the Kazimirowski painting first hung in the [[Franciscans|Bernardine Sisters']] [[convent]] near the [[Church of St. Michael, Vilnius|church of St. Michael]], where Sopo\u0107ko was a rector. In her diary, Faustina wrote that Jesus told her to inform her confessor that the proper place for the painting was in a church, not in the hallway of a convent. The first public exposition of the Kazimirowski painting was on 26\u201328 April 1935, at the Church of the [[Gate of Dawn]] in Vilnius.<ref name=Drake85/>  In 1937, on the Sunday after Easter (later instituted as Divine Mercy Sunday by Pope John Paul II), the painting was put on display beside the main altar in [[Church of St. Michael, Vilnius|St. Michael\u2019s Church in Vilnius]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.piligrimukelias.lt/index.php?id=122&lng=1|title=Jono Pauliaus II piligrim\u0173 kelias.

The painting remained in the disused church building until 1951, when two pious women from Vilnius, Bron\u0117 Miniotait\u0117 and Janina Rodzevi\u010d, bought the canvas from a guard and concealed it in an attic for several years. Later, they gave it to the parish priest at the [[Dominican Church of the Holy Spirit]] for safekeeping, who chose not to display it in the church. Fr. Sopocko, who had relocated to Poland but was unable to take the painting with him, expressed concern about it to his friend Fr. J\u00f3zef Grasewicz, who obtained the painting and moved it to his own parish church in Nova Ruda, [[Belarus]]. There, it was displayed and venerated by the local parishioners. In 1970, the Soviets closed that church and used it as a storage warehouse, but left the painting hanging in the disused church, where parishioners continued to venerate it in secret. In 1986, Fr. Grasewicz arranged for the painting to be replaced by a copy and the original to be secretly transported back to the Church of the Holy Spirit in Vilnius, where it underwent a restoration that significantly changed its appearance and was then displayed and venerated in the church. In 2003, the painting, which had deteriorated due to exposure, attempts at cleaning, and the previous restoration, was professionally restored to its original look. In 2005 it was moved to its current location above the main altar in the [[Sanctuary of the Divine Mercy, Vilnius|Sanctuary of Divine Mercy]] in Vilnius.<ref name=divinemercyfilm /><ref name=historyoffirstimage />\n\nIn 2016, a documentary film, entitled ''The Original Image of Divine Mercy'', was released that told the story of the original Divine Mercy painting and its survival over the decades. Made with the cooperation of the [[Archdiocese of Vilnius]], the film included interviews with [[Jim Gaffigan]], [[Robert Barron|Bishop Robert Barron]], [[Harry Connick Jr.]], and [[Gintaras Grusas|Archbishop Gintaras Grusas]], who also served as executive producer.<ref name=divinemercyfilm /> \n\n=== Hy\u0142a painting ===\nAnother painting of the Divine Mercy was made by [[Adolf Hy\u0142a]], as a [[Ex-voto|votive offering]]. Through painting this picture, Hy\u0142a expressed his gratitude for the survival of his family during [[World War II]].\n\nHy\u0142a was given the descriptions from Faustina's diary by the nuns at the convent, and a small copy of the first painting. Hy\u0142a's image is somewhat different from Kazimierowski's, as the former figured Jesus as a \"Divine Physician\", walking the earth and healing people. He has Jesus approaching the viewer instead of merely standing. Christ's right hand is lifted up high in benediction, and He is looking into the eyes of the viewer. The original version of this painting had a country landscape in the background, which was removed in a later replica as it was deemed \"non-liturgical\".\n\nThe Hy\u0142a rendition is also called the \"Krak\u00f3w Divine Mercy Image\" because it is kept in the sanctuary at [[\u0141agiewniki-Borek Fa\u0142\u0119cki|Krak\u00f3w-\u0141agiewniki]].\n\n===Other versions===\n[[File:Divine Mercy Christ - 1.JPG|thumb|Statue of Merciful Jesus in [[Divine Mercy Shrine (Misamis Oriental)]]]]\nBefore Adolf Hy\u0142a offered his votive painting, the sisters had commissioned [[Stanis\u0142aw Kaczor-Batowski|Stanis\u0142aw Batowski]] to paint a third version. This was lost in a fire, and Batowski painted a fourth painting which arrived at the convent at almost the same time as Hy\u0142a's. [[Cardinal Sapieha]], who happened to be in the convent then, selected the Hy\u0142a painting because it was a votive image.<ref>''A Divine Mercy Resource'' by Richard Torretto 2010 {{ISBN|1-4502-3236-1}} page 88</ref> A number of other artists have painted the image, but Hy\u0142a's rendition remains the most reproduced one.<ref name=Butler >''Butler's lives of the saints: the third millennium'' by Paul Burns, Alban Butler 2001 {{ISBN|978-0-86012-383-5}} page 252</ref>\n\n\"The image of The Divine Mercy, painted by Adam Styka (1957), [is] displayed in the Sanctuary of The Divine Mercy at the Congregation of Marians in Stockbridge, MA USA.\" (''Diary'' pictures of images).
