It was the home of the [[Scarlets]] region and [[Llanelli RFC]] rugby teams. The stadium was a combination of seating and standing with a total capacity of 10,800.  With the Scarlets having moved to [[Parc y Scarlets]], Stradey Park was demolished in 2010 and is to be replaced with housing. Now as well there is a tattoo parlour there is well.\n\n== History ==\nThe ground originally opened in 1879 for use by Llanelli RFC. In 1887, Stradey Park was chosen to host its first international rugby union match. In the early days of international rugby, all the British countries switched venues on a regular basis to allow supporters the chance to see their team and clubs the opportunity of share gate receipts. Stradey Park was selected as part of the [[1887 Home Nations Championship]], with the opening home match for [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]] being against [[England national rugby union team|England]]. The game was arranged for 8 January and a temporary stand was erected to allow a seating area so the club could charge higher ticket prices; but on the day the English team refused to play on the ground as the pitch was frozen.<ref name=\"Godwin16\">Godwin (1984), pg 16.</ref> The adjacent cricket ground was in better condition, so the match was moved there along with the entire crowd, many members of which were extremely unhappy as they lost their seating area.\n\nFour years later, Stradey Park was given another chance to host the national side when they were again selected to host the [[1891 Home Nations Championship|Home Nations Championship]]. In the final match, Stradey Park played host to [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]] and again temporary stands were erected, this time on the east and west sides. On this occasion there were no problems and the ground successfully hosted an international match on 7 March 1891. Although no official attendance figures were taken, the ''South Wales Daily News'' stated 'an immense concourse of people assembled on the park; in fact it was the largest that had ever been witnessed at a football match in the tin plate town'.<ref name=\"Godwin30\">Godwin (1984), pg 30.</ref> Two years later, Stradey Park was the final venue of the [[1893 Home Nations Championship]], hosting Wales against [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]]. Wales, under the captaincy of Welsh rugby legend [[Arthur Gould (rugby player)|Arthur Gould]], beat the Irish team by a single try scored by Gould's brother, [[Bert Gould]]. The score not only gave Wales the win but also saw Wales lift the [[Triple Crown (rugby union)|Triple Crown]] for the very first time in the country's history.  \n\nThe ground has seen many memorable games including the defeats of [[Australian national rugby union team|Australia]] in 1967 and [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand]] in 1972.\n\nStradey Park has twice hosted games in the Rugby World Cup, featuring [[Argentina national rugby union team|Argentina]] on both occasions, against Australia in [[1991 Rugby World Cup|1991]] and [[Samoa national rugby union team|Samoa]] in [[1999 Rugby World Cup|1999]]. \n\nOne [[rugby league]] game was held at Stradey Park. This was between [[Wales national rugby league team|Wales]] and [[Lebanon national rugby league team|Lebanon]] in the [[2000 Rugby League World Cup]] on 2 November 2000. Wales won 24\u201322.\n\nDue to the ground's owners, Llanelli RFU Ltd., having financial difficulties following the game turning professional, Stradey Park was sold to the [[Welsh Rugby Union]] in 1997 for \u00a31.25 million. The ground was repurchased by Llanelli RFU Ltd. in 2005.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/welsh/4397448.stm | title=Stradey Park bought back from WRU | work=BBC Sport | date=1 November 2005| accessdate=15 January 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn 24 October 2008, the Scarlets defeated Bristol in the last ever game to be held at the ground by 28 points to nil, a crowd of over 10,800 witnessing the event.\n\nWhen the [[Scarlets]] regional side was formed in 2004, it was decided that they would play the majority of their home fixtures at Stradey Park. Llanelli RFC continued to play their home matches at the ground. The stadium was also host for the [[Llanelli A.F.C.]] [[UEFA Cup]] games in the 2006/07 season.\n\nThe last ever game to be played at Stradey Park was played on 24 October 2008, when the Scarlets defeated Bristol 27\u20130 in an EDF Energy Cup match. The emotional occasion featured a procession of former club captains, as well as choirs, traditional songs and a firework display to commemorate the closing of the old stadium.\n\n== Future ==\nStradey Park was sold to developer Taylor Wimpey in February 2008. A new stadium, Parc y Scarlets, was built at [[Pemberton, Carmarthenshire|Pemberton]] on the eastern outskirts of Llanelli, financed by [[Carmarthenshire County Council]] and cost an estimated \u00a323 million.  The funding came partly from the re-development of the [[Stradey]] site and also from the sale of a fast-food outlet and hotel on the site of the new stadium. Parc y Scarlets opened on 15 November 2008. \n\nStradey Park Stadium will be demolished and a small garden of remembrance placed on the site to remember the sporting heroes who played there and the fans whose ashes were scattered on the pitch. Residents at Stradey still oppose the high density housing development on the stadium site and the threat to nearby Sandy Lake which may be lost by planned diversion of the Cille River to allow building of these new homes.\n\nThis has caused some controversy as the ground is built on what has been designated by Carmarthenshire County Council as 'Recreation Land', and this has led many local residents to petition for no houses to be built on this land and instead for Stradey Park to be renovated. The site remained derelict for two years after its final match and was eventually demolished in 2010 to be replaced with housing.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.industrytoday.co.uk/sports_and_leisure/cuddy-calls-full-time-for-stradey-park/1831 | title=Cuddy calls full time for Stradey Park | work=Industry Today | author=| date=22 October 2003| accessdate=15 January 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Layout ==\n[[File:StradeyPark.svg|thumb|275px|left|Diagram of Stadium Layout]]\nThe ground was divided up into six separate blocks for the purposes of accommodating spectators.

On 13 September, the 163rd Infantry Brigade and 327th Infantry Regiment raided and patrolled to the northeast of [[Port-sur-Seille]], toward [[Eply]], in the [[Bois de Cheminot]], Bois de la Voivrotte, Bois de la T\u00eate-d'Or, and [[Bois Fr\u00e9haut]]. Meanwhile, the 328th Infantry Regiment, in connection with the attack of the [[90th Infantry Division (United States)|90th Division]] against the Bois-le-Pr\u00eatre, advanced on the west of the [[Moselle River]], and, in contact with the 90th Division, entered [[Norroy-l\u00e8s-Pont-\u00e0-Mousson|Norroy]], advancing to the heights just north of that town where it consolidated its position. On 15 September, the 328th Infantry, in order to protect the 90th Division's flank, resumed the advance, and reached [[Vandi\u00e8res, Meurthe-et-Moselle|Vandi\u00e8res]], but withdrew on the following day to the high ground north of Norroy.<ref name=\"wwihist\" />\n\nOn 17 September, the St-Mihiel Operation stabilized, and the 90th Division relieved the 82nd's troops west of the Moselle River.

On 7{{nbsp}}October the division, minus the 163rd Infantry Brigade, attacked the northeastern edge of the [[Forest of Argonne|Argonne Forest]], making some progress toward [[Cornay]], and occupied Hill 180 and Hill 223. The next day it resumed the attack. Elements of the division's right flank entered Cornay but later withdrew to the east and south. The division's left flank reached the southeastern slope of the high ground northwest of [[Ch\u00e2tel-Ch\u00e9h\u00e9ry]].

It then attacked and captured [[Cornay]] and [[Enghien|Marcq]], and established the front just to their south. On 11 October, the right flank of the division occupied Sommerance and the high ground north of la Rance Rau while the left advanced to the railroad south of the Aire. The next day, the [[42nd Division (United States)|42nd]] relieved the 82nd's troops in and near Sommerance, allowing it to resume the attack.

It was recalled to active service on 25 March 1942, and reorganized at [[Camp Claiborne]], [[Louisiana]], under the command of [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[Omar Bradley]]. During this training period, the division brought together three officers who would ultimately steer the U.S. Army during the following two decades: [[Matthew Ridgway]], [[James M. Gavin]], and [[Maxwell D. Taylor]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Blair|first=Clay|title=Ridgeway's Paratroopers The American Airborne in World War II|year=1985|publisher=Naval Institute Press|pages=Plate 11}}</ref> Under Major General Bradley, the 82nd Division's [[Chief of staff|Chief of Staff]] was [[George Van Pope]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Doyle|first=Charles H.|title=Stand in the Door!|year=1988|publisher=Phillips Publications|location=Williamstown, New Jersey|page=104|author2=Terrell Stewart}}</ref>\n\nOn 15 August 1942, the 82nd Infantry Division, now commanded by Major General Ridgway, became the first airborne division in the history of the U.S. Army, and was redesignated as the '''82nd Airborne Division'''. The division initially consisted of the [[325th Infantry Regiment (United States)|325th]], [[326th Infantry Regiment (United States)|326th]] and [[327th Infantry Regiment (United States)|327th Infantry Regiment]]s, and supporting units. The 327th was soon transferred to help form the [[101st Airborne Division]] and was replaced by the [[504th Infantry Regiment (United States)|504th Parachute Infantry Regiment]], leaving the division with two regiments of [[glider infantry]] and one of [[Paratrooper|parachute infantry]]. In February 1943 the division received another change when the 326th was transferred to the [[13th Airborne Division (United States)|13th Airborne Division]], being replaced by the [[505th Infantry Regiment (United States)|505th Parachute Infantry Regiment]], under James M. Gavin, then a [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]], who was later destined to command the division.\n\n===Sicily and Italy===\n\nIn April 1943, after several months of tough training, its troopers deployed to the [[Mediterranean Theater of Operations]], under the command of Major General Ridgway to take part in the [[Allied invasion of Sicily|campaign to invade Sicily]]. The division's first two combat operations were [[Paratrooper|parachute assault]]s into Sicily on 9{{nbsp}}July and [[Allied invasion of Italy#Salerno landings|Salerno]] on 13 September 1943. The initial assault on Sicily, by the 505th Parachute Regimental Combat Team, under Colonel Gavin, was the first regimental-sized combat parachute assault conducted by the United States Army. The first glider assault did not occur until [[Normandy landings|Operation Neptune]] as part of the [[Normandy landings|D-Day landings of 6 June 1944]]. Glider troopers of the [[319th Field Artillery Regiment|319th]] and [[320th Field Artillery Regiment|320th Glider Field Artillery Battalion]]s and the 325th Glider Infantry Regiment (and the 3rd Battalion of the 504th PIR) instead arrived in Italy by [[landing craft]] at Maiori (319th) and Salerno (320th, 325th).\n\nIn January 1944, the 504th, commanded by [[Reuben Henry Tucker III|Colonel Reuben Tucker]], which was temporarily detached to [[Battle of Anzio|fight at Anzio]], adopted the nickname \"Devils in Baggy Pants\", taken from an entry in a German officer's diary. The 504th was replaced in the division by the inexperienced [[507th Parachute Infantry Regiment (United States)|507th Parachute Infantry Regiment]], under the command of Colonel [[George V. Millet, Jr.]]. While the 504th was detached, the remainder of the 82nd Airborne Division moved to the [[United Kingdom]] in November 1943 to prepare for the liberation of Europe. See [[RAF North Witham]] and [[RAF Folkingham]].\n\n===Normandy===\n\nWith two combat drops under its belt, the 82nd Airborne Division was now ready for the most ambitious airborne operation of the war so far, as part of [[Normandy landings|Operation Neptune]], the Allied [[invasion of Normandy]]. The division conducted [[Mission Boston]], part of the airborne assault phase of the [[Operation Overlord]] plan.\n\nIn preparation for the operation, the division was significantly reorganized. To ease the integration of replacement troops, rest, and refitting following the fighting in Italy, the 504th PIR did not rejoin the division for the invasion. Two new parachute infantry regiments (PIRs), the [[507th Parachute Infantry Regiment (United States)|507th]] and the [[508th Infantry Regiment (United States)|508th]], provided it, along with the veteran 505th, a three-parachute infantry regiment punch. The 325th was also reinforced by the addition of the 3rd Battalion of the [[401st Infantry Regiment (United States)|401st GIR]], bringing it up to a strength of three battalions.\n\nOn 5 and 6 June these paratroopers, parachute artillery elements, and the 319th and 320th, boarded hundreds of transport planes and [[Military glider|gliders]] to begin history's largest airborne assault at the time (only [[Operation Market Garden]] later that year would be larger). During the 6{{nbsp}}June assault, a 508th platoon leader, [[First lieutenant|First Lieutenant]] [[Robert P. Mathias]], would be the first U.S. Army officer killed by German fire on D-Day.<ref>{{cite book |title=D-Day |publisher=Pocket Books |author=Ambrose, S. E. |year=2002 |page=24}}</ref> On 7{{nbsp}}June, after this first wave of attack, the 325th GIR would arrive by glider to provide a division reserve.\n\nIn Normandy, the 82nd gained its first [[Medal of Honor]] of the war, belonging to [[Private first class|Private First Class]] [[Charles N. DeGlopper]] of the 325th GIR.<ref>http://www.lonesentry.com/usdivisions/medal-of-honor/airborne/division/82nd_airborne_division.html</ref> By the time the division was relieved, in early July, the 82nd had seen 33 days of severe combat and casualties had been heavy. Losses included 5,245 troopers killed, wounded, or missing, for a total of 46% casualties. Major General Ridgway's post-battle report stated in part, \"...&nbsp;33 days of action without relief, without replacements. Every mission accomplished. No ground gained was ever relinquished.\"<ref name=\"divhist\"/>\n\nFollowing Normandy, the 82nd Airborne Division returned to England to rest and refit for future airborne operations. The 82nd became part of the newly organized [[XVIII Airborne Corps]], which consisted of the [[17th Airborne Division (United States)|17th]], 82nd, and [[101st Airborne Division]]s. Ridgway was given command of the corps but was not promoted to [[Lieutenant general (United States)|lieutenant general]] until 1945. His recommendation for succession as division commander was [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[James M. Gavin]], previously the 82nd's ADC. Ridgway's recommendation met with approval, and upon promotion Gavin became the youngest general since the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] to command a U.S. Army division.<ref name=\"Ruggero2007\">{{cite book|last=Ruggero|first=Ed|title=The First Men In: US Paratroopers and the Fight to Save D-Day|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DQHQMGknDB0C&pg=PA307|date=29 May 2007|publisher=Harper Collins|isbn=978-0-06-073129-8|page=307}}</ref>\n\n===Market Garden===\n\nOn 2 August 1944 the division became part of the [[First Allied Airborne Army]]. In September, the 82nd began planning for [[Operation Market Garden]] in the [[Netherlands]]. The operation called for three-plus airborne divisions to seize and hold key bridges and roads deep behind German lines. The 504th PIR, now back at full strength, was reassigned to the 82nd, while the 507th was assigned to the [[17th Airborne Division (United States)|17th Airborne Division]], at the time training in England.\n[[File:82nd Grave.jpg|thumb|Men of the 82nd Airborne Division drop near Grave in the Netherlands during [[Operation Market Garden]]]]\n\nOn 17 September, the \"All American\" Division conducted its fourth (and final) combat jump of World War II. Fighting off German counterattacks, the division captured its objectives between [[Grave, Netherlands|Grave]], and [[Nijmegen]]. The division failed to capture Nijmegen Bridge when the opportunity presented itself early in the battle. When the British XXX Corps arrived in Nijmegen, six hours ahead of schedule, they found themselves having to fight to take a bridge that should have already been in allied hands. In the afternoon of Wednesday 20 September 1944, the 82nd Airborne Division conducted a successfully opposed river assault on the river crossing of the [[Waal (river)|Waal]] river. War correspondent [[Bill Downs]], who witnessed the assault, described it as \"a single, isolated battle that ranks in magnificence and courage with [[Battle of Guam (1941)|Guam]], [[Battle of Tarawa|Tarawa]], [[Omaha Beach]]. A story that should be told to the blowing of bugles and the beating of drums for the men whose bravery made the capture of this crossing over the Waal possible.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Megellas|first1=James|title=All the Way to Berlin: A Paratrooper at War in Europe|date=2007|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-41448-9|page=165|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gmHcQPxrfT4C&pg=PA165}}</ref>\n\nThe Market Garden salient was held in a defensive operation for several weeks until the 82nd was relieved by Canadian troops, and sent into reserve in France.

In [[SHAEF]] reserve, the 82nd was committed on the northern face of the bulge near Elsenborn Ridge.\n\nOn 20 December 1944, the 82nd Airborne Division was assigned to take Cheneux where they would force the Waffen SS Division Leibstandarte's Kampfgruppe Peiper into a fighting retreat. On 21\u201322 December 1944, the 82nd Airborne faced counterattacks from three powerful Waffen SS divisions which included the [[1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler]], [[2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich]], and the [[9th SS Panzer Division Hohenstaufen]]. The [[Waffen SS]] efforts to relieve Kampfgruppe Peiper failed due to the stubborn defense of the 82nd Airborne.<ref>\"Four Stars of Valor: The Combat history of the 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment in World War II\" Nordyke, P., 2006 p. 329\u2013331.</ref>\n\nOn 23 December, <!-- it --> the German divisions attacked from the south and overran the [[325th Infantry Regiment (United States)|325th GIR]] holding the Baraque- Fraiture crossroads on the 82nd's southern flank, endangering the entire 82nd Airborne division. The 2nd SS Panzer's objective was to outflank the 82nd Airborne. It was not an attack designed to reach Peiper, but it was his last chance, nonetheless. If it did outflank the 82nd, it could have opened a corridor and reached the stranded yet still powerful Kampfgruppe. But the attack came too late.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nOn 24 December 1944, the 82nd Airborne Division with an official strength of 8,520 men was facing off against a vastly superior combined force of 43,000 men and over 1,200 armored fighting and artillery vehicles and pieces.<ref>Timothy J. \"The Ardennes on Fire: The First Day of the German Assault\" 2010 pp. 56\u201358.</ref> Due to these circumstances, the 82nd Airborne Division was forced to withdrawal for the first time in its combat history.<ref>Gavin, J. \"On To Berlin: Battles of an Airborne Commander 1943\u20131946\", 1978 p. 239.</ref> The Germans pursued their retreat with the 2nd and 9th SS Panzer Divisions.

Of the 826 men who went into the Ardennes, only 110 came out. Having lost its charismatic leader Lt.

The 82nd was not sent to the [[Korean War]], as both Presidents [[Harry S.

Spearheaded by the 3rd Brigade, the 82nd deployed in [[Operation Power Pack]].\n\nA year later, the 82nd went into action in [[Vietnam]]. During the [[Tet Offensive]], which swept across Vietnam in January 1968, the 3rd Brigade was en route to [[Chu Lai]] within 24 hours of receiving its orders. The 3rd Brigade performed combat duties in the [[Camp Eagle|Hu\u1ebf]] \u2013 [[Phu Bai Combat Base|Phu Bai]] area of the I Corps sector. Later the brigade moved south to [[Saigon]], and fought in the [[Mekong Delta]], the [[Iron Triangle (Vietnam)|Iron Triangle]] and along the [[Cambodia]]n border, serving nearly 22 months. While the 3rd Brigade was deployed, the division created a provisional 4th Brigade, consisting of 4th Battalion, 325th Infantry; 3d Battalion, 504th Infantry; and 3d Battalion, 505th Infantry. An additional unit, the [[3rd Battalion, 320th Field Artillery Regiment|3d Battalion, 320th Artillery]], was activated under Division Artillery to support the 4th Brigade.\n\nThe units assigned and attached to the 3d Brigade of the 82nd Airborne Division were as follows:<ref>''Vietnam Order of Battle'', by Captain (Ret.) Shelby L. Stanton, p. 83</ref>\n* Brigade Infantry:\n** 1st Battalion (Airborne), 505th Infantry\n** 2nd Battalion (Airborne), 505th Infantry\n** 1st Battalion (Airborne), 508th Infantry\n* Brigade Artillery:\n** 2nd Battalion (Airborne), 321st Artillery (105mm)\n* Brigade Aviation:\n** Company A, 82nd Aviation Battalion\n* Brigade Reconnaissance:\n** Troop B, 1st Squadron (Armored), 17th Cavalry\n** Company O (Ranger), 75th Infantry\n* Brigade Support:\n** 82nd Support Battalion\n** 58th Signal Company\n** Company C, 307th Engineer Battalion (Airborne)\n** 408th Army Security Agency Detachment\n** 52nd Chemical Detachment\n** 518th Military Intelligence Detachment\n** 307th Medical (Airborne) Headquarters and Alpha Company\n\nThe deployment of the 3rd Brigade took place with significant problems and controversy. In ''The Rise and Fall of an American Army: U.S. Ground Forces in Vietnam, 1965\u20131973,'' author Shelby L. Stanton describes how, other than the 82d, only two under-strength Marine and four skeletonized Army divisions were left stateside by the beginning of 1968. MACV, desperate for additional manpower, wanted the division to deploy to Vietnam, and the Department of the Army, wishing to retain its \"sole readily deployable strategic reserve, the last real vestige of actual Army divisional combat potency in the United States left to the Pentagon,\" compromised by sending the 3d Brigade. As Stanton wrote:\n\n<blockquote>The division had been so rushed to get this brigade to the battlefront that it ignored individual deployment criteria. Paratroopers who had just returned from Vietnam now found themselves suddenly going back. The howl of soldier complaints was so vehement that the Department of the Army was soon forced to give each trooper who had deployed to Vietnam with the 3d Brigade the option of returning to Fort Bragg or remaining with the unit. To compensate for the abrupt departures from home for those who elected to stay with the unit, the Army authorized a month leave at the soldiers' own expense or a two-week leave with government aircraft provided for special flights back to North Carolina. Of the 3,650 paratroopers who had deployed from Fort Bragg, 2,513 elected to return to the United States at once. MACV had no paratroopers to replace them, and overnight the brigade was transformed into a separate light infantry brigade, airborne in name only.</blockquote>\n\n===Urban riots in 1967\u201368===\n====1967 Detroit Riot====\nOn 24 July 1967, shortly before midnight, President [[Lyndon B.

In November 1979, the division was alerted for a possible operation to rescue the American hostages in [[Iran]].

The first 82d unit to deploy was a task force of the 2d and 3d Battalions (Airborne), 325th Infantry. On 26 October and 27, the 1st Battalion (Airborne), 505th Infantry, and the 1st and 2nd Battalions (Airborne), 508th Infantry, deployed to [[Grenada]] with support units. 2-505 deployed as well.

The operation was flawed in several areas and identified areas needing attention to enhance the United States RDF doctrine. Newly issued Battledress Uniforms (BDUs) were not designed for the tropical environment; communication between Army ground forces and Navy and Air Force aircraft lacked interoperability and even food and other logistic support to ground forces were hampered due to communication issues between the services.

The goal of the 1st Brigade task force, which was made up of the 1-504th and 2-504th INF as well as 4-325th INF and Company A, 3-505th INF, and 3-319th FAR, was to oust [[Manuel Noriega]] from power. They were joined on the ground by 3-504th INF, which was already in Panama. The invasion was initiated with a night combat jump and airfield seizures; the 82nd conducted follow-on combat air assault missions in [[Panama City]] and the surrounding areas of the Gatun Locks. The operation continued with an assault of multiple strategic installations, such as the Punta Paitilla Airport in Panama City and a Panamanian Defense Forces (PDF) garrison and airfield at Rio Hato, where Noriega also maintained a residence. The attack on La Comandancia (PDF HQ) touched off several fires, one of which destroyed most of the adjoining and heavily populated El Chorrillo neighborhood in downtown Panama City. The 82d Airborne Division secured several other key objectives such as Madden Dam, El Ranacer Prison, Gatun Locks, Gamboa and Fort Cimarron. Overall, the operation involved 27,684 U.S. troops and over 300 aircraft, including C-130 Hercules, AC-130 Spectre gunship, OA-37B Dragonfly observation, and attack aircraft, C-141 and C-5 strategic transports, F-117A Nighthawk stealth aircraft and AH-64 Apache attack helicopters. The invasion of Panama was the first combat deployment for the AH-64, the HMMWV, and the F-117A. In the short six years since the [[Operation Urgent Fury|Invasion of Grenada]], Operation Just Cause demonstrated how quickly the US Armed Forces could adapt and overcome the mistakes and equipment interoperability issues to conduct a quick and decisive victory. In all, the 82d Airborne Division suffered six of the 23 fatalities of the operation. The paratroopers began redeployment to Fort Bragg on 12 January 1990.

In the coming weeks using primarily the 5-Ton cargo trucks of these NG truck companies, the 1st Brigade moved north to \"tap line road\" in the vicinity of [[Rafha]], Saudi Arabia. Eventually, these National Guard truck units effectively \"motorized\" the 325th Infantry, providing the troop ground transportation required for them to keep pace with the French [[Division Daguet]] during the incursion. The ground war began almost six weeks later. The 2-325th INF was the division's spearhead for the ground war who actually took positions over the Iraqi border 24 hours in advance of coalition forces at 0800hrs on 22 February 1991 on Objectives Tin Man and Rochambeau. On 23 February, 82d Airborne Division paratroopers protected the [[XVIII Airborne Corps (United States)|XVIII Airborne Corps]] flank as fast-moving armor and mechanized units moved deep inside south-western Iraq. After the second day, the 1st Brigade moved forward to extend the Corps flank along with 3d Brigade. In the short 100-hour ground war, the 82d drove deep into Iraq and captured thousands of Iraqi soldiers and tons of equipment, weapons, and ammunition. During that time, the 82nd's band and MP company processed 2,721 prisoners. After the liberation of [[Kuwait]] and the surrender of the Iraqi Army, the 82nd redeployed to Fort Bragg between 18 March and 22 April after being deployed for a period of seven months.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n===Hurricane Andrew===\n\nIn August 1992, the division deployed a task force to the hurricane-ravaged area of South Florida to provide humanitarian assistance following [[Hurricane Andrew]].

At the same time, former U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]] and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff [[Colin Powell]] were negotiating with C\u00e9dras to restore Aristide to power, the 82nd's first wave was in the air, with paratroopers waiting at Green Ramp to air-land in Ha\u00efti once the airfields there had been seized. When the Haitian military verified from sources outside [[Pope Air Force Base]] that the 82d was on the way, C\u00e9dras stepped down, averting the invasion.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nFormer Vice President [[Al Gore]] would later travel to Fort Bragg to personally thank the paratroopers of the 82nd for their actions, noting in a speech on 19 September 1994, that the 82nd's reputation was enough to change C\u00e9dras' mind:\n\n{{quote|But it did get a little close there for a while. As you may know, there were 61 planes in the air headed toward Ha\u00efti at the time they finally agreed. And at one point General Biamby came in and told General C\u00e9dras that he had just gotten word on his telephone that the airplanes had taken off from Pope Air Force Base, with soldiers from Fort Bragg, and that both disconcerted them and caused them to be suspicious of the intent of the negotiations, but it also created a situation where immediately after that, the key points they had been refusing to agree to were agreed to, a date certain, other matters that I won't go into in detail here.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}}}\n\n===Operations Safe Haven and Safe Passage===\n\nOn 12 December 1994, the 2nd Battalion (Airborne), 505th Infantry, with the 2nd Platoon of Company C, 307th Engineer Battalion, deployed as part of [[Operations Safe Haven and Safe Passage]].

The battalion participated in the safeguarding of the Cuban refugees, a camp cordon and reorganization, and the active patrolling in and around the refugee camps in and around the Panamanian jungle along the Panama canal for two months. General Engineering support in the area of camp establishment/improvement operations was provided by the Sappers of the habitually associated Task Force Panther Engineer platoon, 2/C-307th. (Task Force Panther was commanded by LTC Lloyd J. Austin III, who would later be the first African American General to command U.S. Central Command.) This support included the planning of camp power requirements, pouring of 78 concrete pads, three-foot bridges, a set of \"mock doors\" for airborne pre-jump training, and a system of decks for the muddy camp. During the deployment, the paratroopers experienced a 92-degree Christmas Day and returned to Fort Bragg on 14 February 1995.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n===Operation Joint Endeavor: Bosnia===\n\nBattalions of the 82d prepared for a possible parachute jump to support elements of the [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Armored Division]] which had been ordered to Bosnia-Herzegovina as part of [[Operation Joint Endeavor]]. Only after engineers of the 1st Armored Division bridged the [[Sava|Sava River]] on 31 December 1995 without hostilities did the 82d begin to draw down against plans for a possible airborne operation there. The 82d's 49th [[Public affairs (military)|Public Affairs Detachment]] was deployed in support of the 1st Armored Division and air-landed in Tuzla with the 1AD TAC CP and began PA operations to include establishing the first communications in print and radio and covering the crossing of the Sava River by the main forces.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n===Centrazbat '97===\n[[File:Ceremonies marking the end of CENTRAZBAT '97.jpg|thumb|Closing ceremonies of ''CENTRAZBAT '97'' in [[Chirchik]]]]\n\nIn September 1997 the 82d traveled to [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Uzbekistan]] for CENTRAZBAT '97.

The 163rd Infantry Brigade remained in reserve. On 7{{nbsp}}October the division, minus the 163rd Infantry Brigade, attacked the northeastern edge of the [[Forest of Argonne|Argonne Forest]], making some progress toward [[Cornay]], and occupied Hill 180 and Hill 223. The next day it resumed the attack. Elements of the division's right flank entered Cornay but later withdrew to the east and south. The division's left flank reached the southeastern slope of the high ground northwest of [[Ch\u00e2tel-Ch\u00e9h\u00e9ry]].

It then attacked and captured [[Cornay]] and [[Enghien|Marcq]], and established the front just to their south. On 11 October, the right flank of the division occupied Sommerance and the high ground north of la Rance Rau while the left advanced to the railroad south of the Aire. The next day, the [[42nd Division (United States)|42nd]] relieved the 82nd's troops in and near Sommerance, allowing it to resume the attack. The 82nd passed through part of the [[Hindenburg line|Hindenburg]] defensive position and reached a line just north of the road from St-Georges to St-Juvin.<ref name=\"wwihist\" />\n\nOn 18 October, the division relieved elements of the [[78th Division (United States)|78th]] as far to the left as Marcq and [[Champigneulle]].

It was recalled to active service on 25 March 1942, and reorganized at [[Camp Claiborne]], [[Louisiana]], under the command of [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[Omar Bradley]]. During this training period, the division brought together three officers who would ultimately steer the U.S. Army during the following two decades: [[Matthew Ridgway]], [[James M. Gavin]], and [[Maxwell D. Taylor]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Blair|first=Clay|title=Ridgeway's Paratroopers The American Airborne in World War II|year=1985|publisher=Naval Institute Press|pages=Plate 11}}</ref> Under Major General Bradley, the 82nd Division's [[Chief of staff|Chief of Staff]] was [[George Van Pope]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Doyle|first=Charles H.|title=Stand in the Door!|year=1988|publisher=Phillips Publications|location=Williamstown, New Jersey|page=104|author2=Terrell Stewart}}</ref>\n\nOn 15 August 1942, the 82nd Infantry Division, now commanded by Major General Ridgway, became the first airborne division in the history of the U.S. Army, and was redesignated as the '''82nd Airborne Division'''. The division initially consisted of the [[325th Infantry Regiment (United States)|325th]], [[326th Infantry Regiment (United States)|326th]] and [[327th Infantry Regiment (United States)|327th Infantry Regiment]]s, and supporting units. The 327th was soon transferred to help form the [[101st Airborne Division]] and was replaced by the [[504th Infantry Regiment (United States)|504th Parachute Infantry Regiment]], leaving the division with two regiments of [[glider infantry]] and one of [[Paratrooper|parachute infantry]]. In February 1943 the division received another change when the 326th was transferred to the [[13th Airborne Division (United States)|13th Airborne Division]], being replaced by the [[505th Infantry Regiment (United States)|505th Parachute Infantry Regiment]], under James M. Gavin, then a [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]], who was later destined to command the division.\n\n===Sicily and Italy===\n\nIn April 1943, after several months of tough training, its troopers deployed to the [[Mediterranean Theater of Operations]], under the command of Major General Ridgway to take part in the [[Allied invasion of Sicily|campaign to invade Sicily]]. The division's first two combat operations were [[Paratrooper|parachute assault]]s into Sicily on 9{{nbsp}}July and [[Allied invasion of Italy#Salerno landings|Salerno]] on 13 September 1943. The initial assault on Sicily, by the 505th Parachute Regimental Combat Team, under Colonel Gavin, was the first regimental-sized combat parachute assault conducted by the United States Army. The first glider assault did not occur until [[Normandy landings|Operation Neptune]] as part of the [[Normandy landings|D-Day landings of 6 June 1944]]. Glider troopers of the [[319th Field Artillery Regiment|319th]] and [[320th Field Artillery Regiment|320th Glider Field Artillery Battalion]]s and the 325th Glider Infantry Regiment (and the 3rd Battalion of the 504th PIR) instead arrived in Italy by [[landing craft]] at Maiori (319th) and Salerno (320th, 325th).\n\nIn January 1944, the 504th, commanded by [[Reuben Henry Tucker III|Colonel Reuben Tucker]], which was temporarily detached to [[Battle of Anzio|fight at Anzio]], adopted the nickname \"Devils in Baggy Pants\", taken from an entry in a German officer's diary. The 504th was replaced in the division by the inexperienced [[507th Parachute Infantry Regiment (United States)|507th Parachute Infantry Regiment]], under the command of Colonel [[George V. Millet, Jr.]]. While the 504th was detached, the remainder of the 82nd Airborne Division moved to the [[United Kingdom]] in November 1943 to prepare for the liberation of Europe. See [[RAF North Witham]] and [[RAF Folkingham]].\n\n===Normandy===\n\nWith two combat drops under its belt, the 82nd Airborne Division was now ready for the most ambitious airborne operation of the war so far, as part of [[Normandy landings|Operation Neptune]], the Allied [[invasion of Normandy]]. The division conducted [[Mission Boston]], part of the airborne assault phase of the [[Operation Overlord]] plan.\n\nIn preparation for the operation, the division was significantly reorganized. To ease the integration of replacement troops, rest, and refitting following the fighting in Italy, the 504th PIR did not rejoin the division for the invasion. Two new parachute infantry regiments (PIRs), the [[507th Parachute Infantry Regiment (United States)|507th]] and the [[508th Infantry Regiment (United States)|508th]], provided it, along with the veteran 505th, a three-parachute infantry regiment punch. The 325th was also reinforced by the addition of the 3rd Battalion of the [[401st Infantry Regiment (United States)|401st GIR]], bringing it up to a strength of three battalions.\n\nOn 5 and 6 June these paratroopers, parachute artillery elements, and the 319th and 320th, boarded hundreds of transport planes and [[Military glider|gliders]] to begin history's largest airborne assault at the time (only [[Operation Market Garden]] later that year would be larger). During the 6{{nbsp}}June assault, a 508th platoon leader, [[First lieutenant|First Lieutenant]] [[Robert P. Mathias]], would be the first U.S. Army officer killed by German fire on D-Day.<ref>{{cite book |title=D-Day |publisher=Pocket Books |author=Ambrose, S. E. |year=2002 |page=24}}</ref> On 7{{nbsp}}June, after this first wave of attack, the 325th GIR would arrive by glider to provide a division reserve.\n\nIn Normandy, the 82nd gained its first [[Medal of Honor]] of the war, belonging to [[Private first class|Private First Class]] [[Charles N. DeGlopper]] of the 325th GIR.<ref>http://www.lonesentry.com/usdivisions/medal-of-honor/airborne/division/82nd_airborne_division.html</ref> By the time the division was relieved, in early July, the 82nd had seen 33 days of severe combat and casualties had been heavy. Losses included 5,245 troopers killed, wounded, or missing, for a total of 46% casualties. Major General Ridgway's post-battle report stated in part, \"...&nbsp;33 days of action without relief, without replacements. Every mission accomplished. No ground gained was ever relinquished.\"<ref name=\"divhist\"/>\n\nFollowing Normandy, the 82nd Airborne Division returned to England to rest and refit for future airborne operations. The 82nd became part of the newly organized [[XVIII Airborne Corps]], which consisted of the [[17th Airborne Division (United States)|17th]], 82nd, and [[101st Airborne Division]]s. Ridgway was given command of the corps but was not promoted to [[Lieutenant general (United States)|lieutenant general]] until 1945. His recommendation for succession as division commander was [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[James M. Gavin]], previously the 82nd's ADC. Ridgway's recommendation met with approval, and upon promotion Gavin became the youngest general since the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] to command a U.S. Army division.<ref name=\"Ruggero2007\">{{cite book|last=Ruggero|first=Ed|title=The First Men In: US Paratroopers and the Fight to Save D-Day|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DQHQMGknDB0C&pg=PA307|date=29 May 2007|publisher=Harper Collins|isbn=978-0-06-073129-8|page=307}}</ref>\n\n===Market Garden===\n\nOn 2 August 1944 the division became part of the [[First Allied Airborne Army]]. In September, the 82nd began planning for [[Operation Market Garden]] in the [[Netherlands]]. The operation called for three-plus airborne divisions to seize and hold key bridges and roads deep behind German lines. The 504th PIR, now back at full strength, was reassigned to the 82nd, while the 507th was assigned to the [[17th Airborne Division (United States)|17th Airborne Division]], at the time training in England.\n[[File:82nd Grave.jpg|thumb|Men of the 82nd Airborne Division drop near Grave in the Netherlands during [[Operation Market Garden]]]]\n\nOn 17 September, the \"All American\" Division conducted its fourth (and final) combat jump of World War II. Fighting off German counterattacks, the division captured its objectives between [[Grave, Netherlands|Grave]], and [[Nijmegen]]. The division failed to capture Nijmegen Bridge when the opportunity presented itself early in the battle. When the British XXX Corps arrived in Nijmegen, six hours ahead of schedule, they found themselves having to fight to take a bridge that should have already been in allied hands. In the afternoon of Wednesday 20 September 1944, the 82nd Airborne Division conducted a successfully opposed river assault on the river crossing of the [[Waal (river)|Waal]] river. War correspondent [[Bill Downs]], who witnessed the assault, described it as \"a single, isolated battle that ranks in magnificence and courage with [[Battle of Guam (1941)|Guam]], [[Battle of Tarawa|Tarawa]], [[Omaha Beach]]. A story that should be told to the blowing of bugles and the beating of drums for the men whose bravery made the capture of this crossing over the Waal possible.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Megellas|first1=James|title=All the Way to Berlin: A Paratrooper at War in Europe|date=2007|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-41448-9|page=165|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gmHcQPxrfT4C&pg=PA165}}</ref>\n\nThe Market Garden salient was held in a defensive operation for several weeks until the 82nd was relieved by Canadian troops, and sent into reserve in France. During the operation, 19-year-old [[Private (rank)|Private]] [[John R.

In [[SHAEF]] reserve, the 82nd was committed on the northern face of the bulge near Elsenborn Ridge.\n\nOn 20 December 1944, the 82nd Airborne Division was assigned to take Cheneux where they would force the Waffen SS Division Leibstandarte's Kampfgruppe Peiper into a fighting retreat. On 21\u201322 December 1944, the 82nd Airborne faced counterattacks from three powerful Waffen SS divisions which included the [[1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler]], [[2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich]], and the [[9th SS Panzer Division Hohenstaufen]]. The [[Waffen SS]] efforts to relieve Kampfgruppe Peiper failed due to the stubborn defense of the 82nd Airborne.<ref>\"Four Stars of Valor: The Combat history of the 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment in World War II\" Nordyke, P., 2006 p. 329\u2013331.</ref>\n\nOn 23 December, <!-- it --> the German divisions attacked from the south and overran the [[325th Infantry Regiment (United States)|325th GIR]] holding the Baraque- Fraiture crossroads on the 82nd's southern flank, endangering the entire 82nd Airborne division. The 2nd SS Panzer's objective was to outflank the 82nd Airborne. It was not an attack designed to reach Peiper, but it was his last chance, nonetheless. If it did outflank the 82nd, it could have opened a corridor and reached the stranded yet still powerful Kampfgruppe. But the attack came too late.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nOn 24 December 1944, the 82nd Airborne Division with an official strength of 8,520 men was facing off against a vastly superior combined force of 43,000 men and over 1,200 armored fighting and artillery vehicles and pieces.<ref>Timothy J. \"The Ardennes on Fire: The First Day of the German Assault\" 2010 pp. 56\u201358.</ref> Due to these circumstances, the 82nd Airborne Division was forced to withdrawal for the first time in its combat history.<ref>Gavin, J. \"On To Berlin: Battles of an Airborne Commander 1943\u20131946\", 1978 p. 239.</ref> The Germans pursued their retreat with the 2nd and 9th SS Panzer Divisions.

The German objective now became one of defense.\n\nOn 3 January 1945, the 82nd Airborne Division conducted a counterattack. On the first day's fighting the Division overran the 62nd Volksgrenadiers and the 9th SS Panzer's positions capturing 2,400 prisoners.<ref>Gavin, J. \"On To Berlin: Battles of an Airborne Commander 1943\u20131946\", 1978 p. 249.</ref> The 82nd Airborne suffered high casualties in the process. The attached [[551st Parachute Infantry Battalion (United States)|551st Parachute Infantry Battalion]] was all but destroyed during these attacks. Of the 826 men who went into the Ardennes, only 110 came out. Having lost its charismatic leader Lt. Colonel Joerg, and almost all its men either wounded, killed, or frostbitten, the 551 was never reconstituted. The few soldiers who remained were later absorbed into units of the 82nd Airborne.<ref>\"The Last Battle\" published in the Journal \"Army\" April 2001 pp. 38\u201339</ref>\n\nAfter several days of fighting, the destruction of the 62nd Volksgrenadiers, and what had been left of the 9th SS Panzer Division was complete.

Spearheaded by the 3rd Brigade, the 82nd deployed in [[Operation Power Pack]].\n\nA year later, the 82nd went into action in [[Vietnam]]. During the [[Tet Offensive]], which swept across Vietnam in January 1968, the 3rd Brigade was en route to [[Chu Lai]] within 24 hours of receiving its orders. The 3rd Brigade performed combat duties in the [[Camp Eagle|Hu\u1ebf]] \u2013 [[Phu Bai Combat Base|Phu Bai]] area of the I Corps sector. Later the brigade moved south to [[Saigon]], and fought in the [[Mekong Delta]], the [[Iron Triangle (Vietnam)|Iron Triangle]] and along the [[Cambodia]]n border, serving nearly 22 months. While the 3rd Brigade was deployed, the division created a provisional 4th Brigade, consisting of 4th Battalion, 325th Infantry; 3d Battalion, 504th Infantry; and 3d Battalion, 505th Infantry. An additional unit, the [[3rd Battalion, 320th Field Artillery Regiment|3d Battalion, 320th Artillery]], was activated under Division Artillery to support the 4th Brigade.\n\nThe units assigned and attached to the 3d Brigade of the 82nd Airborne Division were as follows:<ref>''Vietnam Order of Battle'', by Captain (Ret.) Shelby L. Stanton, p. 83</ref>\n* Brigade Infantry:\n** 1st Battalion (Airborne), 505th Infantry\n** 2nd Battalion (Airborne), 505th Infantry\n** 1st Battalion (Airborne), 508th Infantry\n* Brigade Artillery:\n** 2nd Battalion (Airborne), 321st Artillery (105mm)\n* Brigade Aviation:\n** Company A, 82nd Aviation Battalion\n* Brigade Reconnaissance:\n** Troop B, 1st Squadron (Armored), 17th Cavalry\n** Company O (Ranger), 75th Infantry\n* Brigade Support:\n** 82nd Support Battalion\n** 58th Signal Company\n** Company C, 307th Engineer Battalion (Airborne)\n** 408th Army Security Agency Detachment\n** 52nd Chemical Detachment\n** 518th Military Intelligence Detachment\n** 307th Medical (Airborne) Headquarters and Alpha Company\n\nThe deployment of the 3rd Brigade took place with significant problems and controversy. In ''The Rise and Fall of an American Army: U.S. Ground Forces in Vietnam, 1965\u20131973,'' author Shelby L. Stanton describes how, other than the 82d, only two under-strength Marine and four skeletonized Army divisions were left stateside by the beginning of 1968. MACV, desperate for additional manpower, wanted the division to deploy to Vietnam, and the Department of the Army, wishing to retain its \"sole readily deployable strategic reserve, the last real vestige of actual Army divisional combat potency in the United States left to the Pentagon,\" compromised by sending the 3d Brigade. As Stanton wrote:\n\n<blockquote>The division had been so rushed to get this brigade to the battlefront that it ignored individual deployment criteria. Paratroopers who had just returned from Vietnam now found themselves suddenly going back. The howl of soldier complaints was so vehement that the Department of the Army was soon forced to give each trooper who had deployed to Vietnam with the 3d Brigade the option of returning to Fort Bragg or remaining with the unit. To compensate for the abrupt departures from home for those who elected to stay with the unit, the Army authorized a month leave at the soldiers' own expense or a two-week leave with government aircraft provided for special flights back to North Carolina. Of the 3,650 paratroopers who had deployed from Fort Bragg, 2,513 elected to return to the United States at once. MACV had no paratroopers to replace them, and overnight the brigade was transformed into a separate light infantry brigade, airborne in name only.</blockquote>\n\n===Urban riots in 1967\u201368===\n====1967 Detroit Riot====\nOn 24 July 1967, shortly before midnight, President [[Lyndon B.

Incidents began to decline, as the paratroopers constantly patrolled the perimeter with [[M16 rifle]]s, [[M60 machine gun]]s, and [[M48 Patton|M48 tanks]], and the police began making arrests on those violating [[curfew]] regulations or who were caught looting. On 27 July, with a sense of normalcy returned to the city, in part due to the presence of Army and National Guard troops, the riot was officially declared over. The Army began to scale down in order to return to their normal duties, leaving the control back to local authorities.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://history.army.mil/html/books/030/30-20/CMH_Pub_30-20.pdf |title=The Role of Federal Military Forces |pages=194\u2013196 |author=Paul J.

War in the Middle East in the fall of 1973 brought the 82nd to full alert. In May 1978, the division was alerted to a possible drop into [[Zaire]]. In November 1979, the division was alerted for a possible operation to rescue the American hostages in [[Iran]]. The division formed the nucleus of the newly created [[United States Rapid Deployment Forces|Rapid Deployment Forces]] (RDF), a mobile force at a permanently high state of readiness.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n===Invasion of Grenada \u2013 Operation Urgent Fury===\n[[File:Point Salinas International Airport, Grenada.jpg|thumb|Southern Objective: Cuban-built Point Salinas Airport, [[Invasion of Grenada|Grenada]], 1983]]\n\n{{Main|United States invasion of Grenada}}\n\nOn 25 October 1983, elements of the 82d conducted an Airland Operation to secure Point Salines Airport following an airborne assault by the [[1st Ranger Battalion (United States)|1st]] and [[2nd Ranger Battalion]]s who conducted the airfield seizure just hours prior. The first 82d unit to deploy was a task force of the 2d and 3d Battalions (Airborne), 325th Infantry. On 26 October and 27, the 1st Battalion (Airborne), 505th Infantry, and the 1st and 2nd Battalions (Airborne), 508th Infantry, deployed to [[Grenada]] with support units. 2-505 deployed as well. Military operations ended in early November (Note: that C/2-325 did not deploy due to being a newly formed COHORT unit, in its place B/2-505 deployed, landing at Point Salines. The 82d expanded its missions from the airhead at Salines to weed out Cuban and Grenadian soldiers Each proceeding battalion pushed a single company forward with A/2-504 deploying only one company out of the entire brigade. The operation was flawed in several areas and identified areas needing attention to enhance the United States RDF doctrine. Newly issued Battledress Uniforms (BDUs) were not designed for the tropical environment; communication between Army ground forces and Navy and Air Force aircraft lacked interoperability and even food and other logistic support to ground forces were hampered due to communication issues between the services. The operation proved the division's ability to act as a rapid deployment force. The first aircraft carrying troopers from the 2-325th touched down at Point Salines 17 hours after H-Hour notification.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nIn March 1988, a brigade task force made up of two battalions from the 504th Infantry and 3d Battalion (Airborne), 505th Infantry, conducted a parachute insertion and air/land operation into [[Honduras]] as part of [[Operation Golden Pheasant]]. The deployment was billed as a joint training exercise, but the paratroopers were ready to fight. The deployment caused the [[Sandinista]]s to withdraw to [[Nicaragua]]. Operation Golden Pheasant prepared the paratroopers for future combat in an increasingly unstable world.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n===Panama: Operation Just Cause===\n[[File:Operation Just Cause.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Tactical map of Operation Just Cause showing major points of attack]]\n\nOn 20 December 1989, the \"All-American\", as part of the [[United States invasion of Panama]], conducted their first combat jump since World War II onto [[Tocumen International Airport|Torrijos International Airport]], Panama. The goal of the 1st Brigade task force, which was made up of the 1-504th and 2-504th INF as well as 4-325th INF and Company A, 3-505th INF, and 3-319th FAR, was to oust [[Manuel Noriega]] from power. They were joined on the ground by 3-504th INF, which was already in Panama. The invasion was initiated with a night combat jump and airfield seizures; the 82nd conducted follow-on combat air assault missions in [[Panama City]] and the surrounding areas of the Gatun Locks. The operation continued with an assault of multiple strategic installations, such as the Punta Paitilla Airport in Panama City and a Panamanian Defense Forces (PDF) garrison and airfield at Rio Hato, where Noriega also maintained a residence. The attack on La Comandancia (PDF HQ) touched off several fires, one of which destroyed most of the adjoining and heavily populated El Chorrillo neighborhood in downtown Panama City. The 82d Airborne Division secured several other key objectives such as Madden Dam, El Ranacer Prison, Gatun Locks, Gamboa and Fort Cimarron. Overall, the operation involved 27,684 U.S. troops and over 300 aircraft, including C-130 Hercules, AC-130 Spectre gunship, OA-37B Dragonfly observation, and attack aircraft, C-141 and C-5 strategic transports, F-117A Nighthawk stealth aircraft and AH-64 Apache attack helicopters. The invasion of Panama was the first combat deployment for the AH-64, the HMMWV, and the F-117A. In the short six years since the [[Operation Urgent Fury|Invasion of Grenada]], Operation Just Cause demonstrated how quickly the US Armed Forces could adapt and overcome the mistakes and equipment interoperability issues to conduct a quick and decisive victory. In all, the 82d Airborne Division suffered six of the 23 fatalities of the operation. The paratroopers began redeployment to Fort Bragg on 12 January 1990. Operation Just Cause concluded on 31 Jan 1990, just 42 days (D+42) since the invasion started.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n==Post\u2013Cold War==\n\n===Persian Gulf War===\n[[File:DesertStormMap v2.svg|thumb|250px|Ground operations during [[Operation Desert Storm]], with the 82nd Airborne Division positioned at the left flank]]\n[[File:82nd US Airborne Division 1989.png|thumb|400px|82nd US Airborne Division 1989]]\n\nSeven months later the paratroopers of the 82nd Airborne Division were again called to war.

The DRF{{nbsp}}2 and{{nbsp}}3 (1-325 and 2-325 INF, respectively) began drawing the \"line in the sand\" near al Jubail by building defenses for possible retrograde operations. Soon after, the rest of the division followed. There, intensive training began in anticipation of desert fighting against the heavily armored [[Iraqi Army]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nOn 16 January 1991, [[Gulf War|Operation Desert Storm]] began when Allied warplanes attacked Iraqi targets. As the air war began, 2d Brigade of the 82d initially deployed near an airfield in the vicinity of the [[ARAMCO]] oil facilities outside [[Abqaiq]], Saudi Arabia. While 1st Brigade and 3d Brigade consolidated at the Division HQ (CHAMPION Main) near [[Dhahran, Saudi Arabia|Dhahran]] in Coinciding with the start of the air war, three National Guard Light-Medium Truck companies, the 253d (NJARNG), 1122d (AKARNG), and the 1058th (MAARNG) joined 2d Brigade of the 82d. In the coming weeks using primarily the 5-Ton cargo trucks of these NG truck companies, the 1st Brigade moved north to \"tap line road\" in the vicinity of [[Rafha]], Saudi Arabia. Eventually, these National Guard truck units effectively \"motorized\" the 325th Infantry, providing the troop ground transportation required for them to keep pace with the French [[Division Daguet]] during the incursion. The ground war began almost six weeks later. The 2-325th INF was the division's spearhead for the ground war who actually took positions over the Iraqi border 24 hours in advance of coalition forces at 0800hrs on 22 February 1991 on Objectives Tin Man and Rochambeau. On 23 February, 82d Airborne Division paratroopers protected the [[XVIII Airborne Corps (United States)|XVIII Airborne Corps]] flank as fast-moving armor and mechanized units moved deep inside south-western Iraq. After the second day, the 1st Brigade moved forward to extend the Corps flank along with 3d Brigade. In the short 100-hour ground war, the 82d drove deep into Iraq and captured thousands of Iraqi soldiers and tons of equipment, weapons, and ammunition. During that time, the 82nd's band and MP company processed 2,721 prisoners. After the liberation of [[Kuwait]] and the surrender of the Iraqi Army, the 82nd redeployed to Fort Bragg between 18 March and 22 April after being deployed for a period of seven months.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n===Hurricane Andrew===\n\nIn August 1992, the division deployed a task force to the hurricane-ravaged area of South Florida to provide humanitarian assistance following [[Hurricane Andrew]]. For more than 30 days, troopers provided food, shelter and medical attention to the [[Florida]] population as part of the U.S. military Domestic Emergency Planning System. The 82nd was part of over 20,000 Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine, Coast Guard and an additional 6200 National Guard troops deployed for the disaster.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ulbrich|first1=Jeffrey|title=82nd Airborne savors 'helping our own'|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1320&dat=19920908&id=bUFWAAAAIBAJ&pg=6807,2622949&hl=en|website=news.google.com|publisher=Gainesville Sun|accessdate=16 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nThey also provided security and a sense of safety for the victims of the storm who were without power, doors, windows and in many cases roofs.

The 82d was scheduled to make combat parachute jumps into Pegasus Drop Zone and PAPIAP Drop Zone (Port-au-Prince Airport), in order to help oust the military dictatorship of [[Raoul C\u00e9dras]], and to restore the democratically elected president, [[Jean-Bertrand Aristide]]. At the same time, former U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]] and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff [[Colin Powell]] were negotiating with C\u00e9dras to restore Aristide to power, the 82nd's first wave was in the air, with paratroopers waiting at Green Ramp to air-land in Ha\u00efti once the airfields there had been seized. When the Haitian military verified from sources outside [[Pope Air Force Base]] that the 82d was on the way, C\u00e9dras stepped down, averting the invasion.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nFormer Vice President [[Al Gore]] would later travel to Fort Bragg to personally thank the paratroopers of the 82nd for their actions, noting in a speech on 19 September 1994, that the 82nd's reputation was enough to change C\u00e9dras' mind:\n\n{{quote|But it did get a little close there for a while.

The battalion deployed from Fort Bragg while on Division Ready Force{{nbsp}}1 to restore order against thousands of Cuban refugees who had attacked and injured a number of Air Force personnel and one marine while protesting their detainment at Empire Range along the [[Panama Canal]]. The battalion participated in the safeguarding of the Cuban refugees, a camp cordon and reorganization, and the active patrolling in and around the refugee camps in and around the Panamanian jungle along the Panama canal for two months.

The sequel to ''[[Bad Boys II]]'' (2003), it is the third installment in the [[Bad Boys (franchise)|''Bad Boys'' franchise]] and is based on a story by Craig and Carnahan. The film stars [[Will Smith]], [[Martin Lawrence]], [[Vanessa Hudgens]], [[Alexander Ludwig]], [[Charles Melton (actor)|Charles Melton]], [[Paola N\u00fa\u00f1ez]], [[Kate del Castillo]], [[Nicky Jam]], and [[Joe Pantoliano]]. Smith co-produced the film with [[Jerry Bruckheimer]] and [[Doug Belgrad]]. In ''Bad Boys for Life'', [[Miami]] detectives Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnett investigate a string of murders tied to Lowrey's troubled past.\n\nA third ''Bad Boys'' film was discussed after the success of the second, with [[Michael Bay]] stating he would be interested in returning to direct, but budgetary constraints made going ahead difficult. The film went through several attempts to enter production over the course of a decade, with a variety of writers and directors attached. The project was eventually finalized and green-lit in October 2018, and filming began the following year, lasting from January to June 2019. [[Principal photography]] took place in [[Atlanta]], [[Miami]] and [[Mexico City]].\n\n''Bad Boys for Life'' was theatrically released in the United States on January 17, 2020, by [[Sony Pictures Releasing]], through [[Columbia Pictures]]. The film received mostly positive reviews from critics,<ref name=\"obenson\" /> and has grossed $419 million worldwide, currently making it the [[2020 in film|highest-grossing film of 2020]]. It is also the highest-grossing installment of the series and the biggest January release of all time.\n\n==Plot==\nIsabel Aretas, widow of cartel kingpin Benito, escapes from a Mexican prison with the aid of her son Armando. Isabel sends Armando to Miami, tasking him with recovering a substantial stash of money his father Benito had hidden, as well as assassinating the people responsible for his father's arrest and eventual death in prison. Isabel demands that Armando kill Miami detective Mike Lowrey last.\n\nIn Miami, Mike accompanies his partner Marcus Burnett to the birth of his first grandson. Desiring to spend more time with his family, the aging Marcus tells Mike he intends to retire, to Mike's chagrin. During a party celebrating Marcus' grandson, Mike is shot by Armando and left in a coma for months. Chastised by Isabel for targeting Mike first, Armando continues to assassinate other targets on his list during Mike's convalescence.\n\nFollowing Mike's recovery, he is determined to seek revenge and unsuccessfully attempts to recruit the now-retired Marcus, causing a fall out between them. Mike violently obtains the identity of arms dealer Booker Grassie from an informant. Realizing that Mike will not heed orders to stay away from the investigation, Captain Howard reluctantly allows him to work with the tech-driven team in charge, the Advanced Miami Metro Operations (AMMO), led by Mike's ex-girlfriend Rita. While the team surveils Grassie at an arms deal, Mike determines that the buyers intend to kill Grassie and intervenes, but fails to save him. Later, Marcus is called by Carver Remy, an old informant who believes the assassin is after him. Marcus contacts Mike and the pair travel to Carver, but are too late to save him. Armando escapes after a fistfight with Mike.\n\nCaptain Howard later reveals his intentions to retire as well, offering advice to Mike that he needs to find a path forward in life. He is abruptly assassinated by Armando moments later. The captain's death pulls Marcus out of retirement, but he intends to work as a team with AMMO. They track down Grassie's accountant, who leads them to Lorenzo \"Zway-Lo\" Rodriguez. They infiltrate Zway-Lo's birthday party leading to a destructive car chase. Armando arrives in a helicopter to rescue Zway-Lo but kills him when he blocks Armando's ability to shoot the pursuing Mike. As he lines up a shot, Armando tells Mike \"Hasta el fuego\". Gunfire from Marcus creates cover for Mike, who falls into the river below.\n\nAMMO is shut down because of the failed operation. In private, Mike reveals to Marcus that Armando may be his son. Before partnering with Marcus, Mike worked as an undercover officer in the Aretas cartel where he met Isabel. They fell in love and intended to run away together, using \"Hasta el fuego\" as a secret catchphrase. Mike ultimately remained loyal to the police, realizing how dangerous Isabel had become. Despite Mike's opposition, Marcus and AMMO join him in Mexico City to confront her.\n\nAt the Hidalgo Palace, Mike meets Isabel and scolds her for concealing the truth from him. A shootout quickly ensues between AMMO and Isabel's men. Marcus shoots the pilot of Isabel's support helicopter, causing it to crash into the central lobby and starting a fire. Marcus confronts Isabel, while Mike tries to explain the truth to Armando. Armando begins to beat up Mike, but he refuses to retaliate. Demanding the truth from his mother, Isabel confirms to Armando that Mike is his father. Unable to kill his father, Armando steps back, and Isabel, while aiming for Mike, inadvertently shoots Armando in the chest. Enraged, she attempts to finish Mike, but Rita intervenes and shoots Isabel several times, sending Isabel falling into the flames below. Marcus then begins to fall into the flames, but is saved by both Mike and Armando. Carrying Armando outside, Mike tells his son that things will not be so good for him due to the crimes he committed, but that he would always be there for him.\n\nReturning to Miami, Rita has been promoted to police captain, and the team celebrates her promotion. Mike arranges for Marcus and Theresa to go on a retreat while he takes care of their grandchild. Sometime later, Mike visits a remorseful Armando in prison, and Armando tells Mike that he is atoning for his sins. Mike then enlists his help for a mission, informing him that it would be a chance to pay back some of his debt, and Armando accepts.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Will Smith]] as Detective Lieutenant Michael

and [[Joe Carnahan]]. The sequel to ''[[Bad Boys II]]'' (2003), it is the third installment in the [[Bad Boys (franchise)|''Bad Boys'' franchise]] and is based on a story by Craig and Carnahan. The film stars [[Will Smith]], [[Martin Lawrence]], [[Vanessa Hudgens]], [[Alexander Ludwig]], [[Charles Melton (actor)|Charles Melton]], [[Paola N\u00fa\u00f1ez]], [[Kate del Castillo]], [[Nicky Jam]], and [[Joe Pantoliano]]. Smith co-produced the film with [[Jerry Bruckheimer]] and [[Doug Belgrad]]. In ''Bad Boys for Life'', [[Miami]] detectives Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnett investigate a string of murders tied to Lowrey's troubled past.\n\nA third ''Bad Boys'' film was discussed after the success of the second, with [[Michael Bay]] stating he would be interested in returning to direct, but budgetary constraints made going ahead difficult. The film went through several attempts to enter production over the course of a decade, with a variety of writers and directors attached. The project was eventually finalized and green-lit in October 2018, and filming began the following year, lasting from January to June 2019. [[Principal photography]] took place in [[Atlanta]], [[Miami]] and [[Mexico City]].\n\n''Bad Boys for Life'' was theatrically released in the United States on January 17, 2020, by [[Sony Pictures Releasing]], through [[Columbia Pictures]]. The film received mostly positive reviews from critics,<ref name=\"obenson\" /> and has grossed $419 million worldwide, currently making it the [[2020 in film|highest-grossing film of 2020]]. It is also the highest-grossing installment of the series and the biggest January release of all time.\n\n==Plot==\nIsabel Aretas, widow of cartel kingpin Benito, escapes from a Mexican prison with the aid of her son Armando. Isabel sends Armando to Miami, tasking him with recovering a substantial stash of money his father Benito had hidden, as well as assassinating the people responsible for his father's arrest and eventual death in prison. Isabel demands that Armando kill Miami detective Mike Lowrey last.\n\nIn Miami, Mike accompanies his partner Marcus Burnett to the birth of his first grandson. Desiring to spend more time with his family, the aging Marcus tells Mike he intends to retire, to Mike's chagrin. During a party celebrating Marcus' grandson, Mike is shot by Armando and left in a coma for months. Chastised by Isabel for targeting Mike first, Armando continues to assassinate other targets on his list during Mike's convalescence.\n\nFollowing Mike's recovery, he is determined to seek revenge and unsuccessfully attempts to recruit the now-retired Marcus, causing a fall out between them. Mike violently obtains the identity of arms dealer Booker Grassie from an informant. Realizing that Mike will not heed orders to stay away from the investigation, Captain Howard reluctantly allows him to work with the tech-driven team in charge, the Advanced Miami Metro Operations (AMMO), led by Mike's ex-girlfriend Rita. While the team surveils Grassie at an arms deal, Mike determines that the buyers intend to kill Grassie and intervenes, but fails to save him. Later, Marcus is called by Carver Remy, an old informant who believes the assassin is after him. Marcus contacts Mike and the pair travel to Carver, but are too late to save him. Armando escapes after a fistfight with Mike.\n\nCaptain Howard later reveals his intentions to retire as well, offering advice to Mike that he needs to find a path forward in life. He is abruptly assassinated by Armando moments later. The captain's death pulls Marcus out of retirement, but he intends to work as a team with AMMO. They track down Grassie's accountant, who leads them to Lorenzo \"Zway-Lo\" Rodriguez. They infiltrate Zway-Lo's birthday party leading to a destructive car chase. Armando arrives in a helicopter to rescue Zway-Lo but kills him when he blocks Armando's ability to shoot the pursuing Mike. As he lines up a shot, Armando tells Mike \"Hasta el fuego\". Gunfire from Marcus creates cover for Mike, who falls into the river below.\n\nAMMO is shut down because of the failed operation. In private, Mike reveals to Marcus that Armando may be his son. Before partnering with Marcus, Mike worked as an undercover officer in the Aretas cartel where he met Isabel. They fell in love and intended to run away together, using \"Hasta el fuego\" as a secret catchphrase. Mike ultimately remained loyal to the police, realizing how dangerous Isabel had become. Despite Mike's opposition, Marcus and AMMO join him in Mexico City to confront her.\n\nAt the Hidalgo Palace, Mike meets Isabel and scolds her for concealing the truth from him. A shootout quickly ensues between AMMO and Isabel's men. Marcus shoots the pilot of Isabel's support helicopter, causing it to crash into the central lobby and starting a fire. Marcus confronts Isabel, while Mike tries to explain the truth to Armando. Armando begins to beat up Mike, but he refuses to retaliate. Demanding the truth from his mother, Isabel confirms to Armando that Mike is his father. Unable to kill his father, Armando steps back, and Isabel, while aiming for Mike, inadvertently shoots Armando in the chest. Enraged, she attempts to finish Mike, but Rita intervenes and shoots Isabel several times, sending Isabel falling into the flames below. Marcus then begins to fall into the flames, but is saved by both Mike and Armando. Carrying Armando outside, Mike tells his son that things will not be so good for him due to the crimes he committed, but that he would always be there for him.\n\nReturning to Miami, Rita has been promoted to police captain, and the team celebrates her promotion. Mike arranges for Marcus and Theresa to go on a retreat while he takes care of their grandchild. Sometime later, Mike visits a remorseful Armando in prison, and Armando tells Mike that he is atoning for his sins. Mike then enlists his help for a mission, informing him that it would be a chance to pay back some of his debt, and Armando accepts.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Will Smith]] as Detective Lieutenant Michael

He was the son of Wentworth Smyth, a Jacobite who had fought in the risings of [[Jacobite rising of 1715|1715]] and [[Jacobite rising of 1745|1745]] and was killed in the Highlands at some time after the birth of his son. According to Stuart\u2019s later account, in 1744 his father was sixty-six and married Maria Julia Dalziel, a girl of fifteen, who died three years later. He reported that his mother was a grand-daughter of [[James Crofts (British Army officer)|General James Crofts]], natural son of the [[James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth|Duke of Monmouth]], who was also his father\u2019s grandfather.<ref name=dnb>[[Edward Irving Carlyle]], \u201cStuart, John Ferdinand Smyth\u201d, in ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]] 1885-1900'', Vol. 55</ref>\n\nJohn Ferdinand Smyth studied medicine at the  University of Edinburgh. He then emigrated to North America, and settled near [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]] in the [[Colony of Virginia]], where he practised as a physician. The [[American Revolutionary War|War of Independence]] broke out, and on 15 October 1775, as a loyalist to the Crown, Smyth quitted Virginia and joined the [[British Army]]. He served in several regiments in the rank of captain. At one time he commanded an armed sloop in [[Chesapeake Bay]] and at another raised a company of men for frontier work. More than once he was taken prisoner, and was shackled for eighteen months.<ref name=dnb/> \n\nAt the end of the war, in 1783, Smyth (as he then was) arrived in England and was awarded a pension of \u00a3300 a year. However, in 1784, allegations were made against him to the claims commissioners, and this pension was suspended, never to be reinstated. Impoverished, he took a job as a barrack-master and wrote his book ''A Tour in the United States of America'', which was published by [[George Robinson (1737\u20131801)|George Robinson]] in 1786. In 1793 he adopted the name of Stuart and went on arguing his case to the government, without success.<ref name=dnb/>\n\nIn 1795, Stuart joined [[Admiral (Royal Navy)|Admiral]] [[Hugh Cloberry Christian|Sir Hugh Cloberry Christian]] on an expedition to the [[West Indies]], where he was shipwrecked three times and fought at the British capture of [[Saint Lucia]]. On his return to England, he learned that his financial claims were too old to succeed. Stuart continued to write.<ref name=dnb/>\n\n==Marriages and death==\nOn 23 October 1778, while he was Captain Smyth of the [[Queen's Rangers]], against her father\u2019s wishes Stuart married Abigail Haugewout, the 23-year-old daughter of Leffert Haugewout, a loyalist farmer of [[Hempstead (village), New York|Hempstead, New York]]. They set up house in [[Oyster Bay (town), New York|Oyster Bay]] and had one daughter, Elizabeth, born in October 1780, but by then Smyth was believed to have returned to England. His abandoned wife lived until 1828, on a farm of fifteen acres in Hempstead which her father gave her. In 1797, Stuart returned on a visit. In 1802, his daughter Elizabeth married Gideon Nichols, a Hempstead merchant, and had six children and many other descendants.<ref name=hofstra>[https://www.hofstra.edu/pdf/library/libspc_lisi_hart_nichols_fa.pdf Hart Nichols Collection, 1730-1930] at hofstra.edu (Special Collections Department, Long Island Studies Institute), pp. 4, 5, 10, 32: \u201dUpon her father\u2019s return to America seventeen years later, a relationship developed with him and his children from his second wife Eunice Grey (c1776-1818).

The distinction between these terms is considered to be important. Race may be regarded as a \u201csocially constructed mechanism for self identification and group membership\u201d and so biologically meaningless, whereas ancestry is a \u201cscientifically derived descriptor of the biological component of population variation\u201d (Konigsberg et al. 2009: 77\u201378). So, why do the rather politically sensitive terms Caucasoid, Mongoloid, or Negroid still appear in published literature (Ousley et al. 2009)? There are considered to be four basic ancestry groups into which an individual can be placed by physical appearance, not accounting for admixture: the sub-Saharan African group (\u201cNegroid\u201d), the European group (\u201cCaucasoid\u201d), the Central Asian group (\u201cMongoloid\u201d), and the Australasian group (\u201cAustraloid\u201d). The rather outdated names of all but one of these groups were originally derived from geography: The Caucasoid group traversed the Caucasus Mountains as they spread into Europe and eastern Asia. Since the majority of native peoples from the Indian subcontinent, northern and northeastern Africa and the Near East fall into this group, to say that the group is of \u201cEuropean\u201d ancestry does not really suffice. Plus, the terms Caucasoid or Caucasian do not have the same oppressive, persecutory connotations as the other terms and so are less likely to cause offense.}}\n*{{cite book|author1=Robert B.

Some might protest that it is \"only a label.\" But language is one of the most systematic, subtle, and significant vehicles for transmitting racial ideology. Terms that describe imagined groups, such as Caucasian, encapsulate those beliefs. Every time we use them and uncritically expose students to them, we are reinforcing rather than dismantling the old racialized worldview.

The way that Blumenbach embraced the term Caucasian suggests that he worked to distance his own anthropological thinking from that of Meiners while recovering the term Caucasian for his own more refined racial classification: he made no mention of Meiners's 1785 usage and gave the term a new meaning.</ref> In contrast to Meiners, however, Blumenbach was a monogenist \u2013 he considered all humans to have a shared origin and to be a single species. Blumenbach, like Meiners, did rank his Caucasian grouping higher than other groups in terms of mental faculties or potential for achievement.<ref name=Bhopal/>\n\nAlongside the anthropologist [[Georges Cuvier]], Blumenbach classified the Caucasian race by cranial measurements and bone morphology in addition to skin pigmentation.<ref>''On the Natural Variety of Mankind'', 3rd ed. (1795) in Bendyshe: 264\u201365; \"racial face,\" 229.</ref> Following Meiners, Blumenbach described the Caucasian race as consisting of the native inhabitants of Europe, West Asia, the Indian peninsula, and North Africa, including toward the south the Moors, Abyssinians and adjacent groups. This usage later grew into the widely used [[color terminology for race]], contrasting with the terms ''Negroid'', ''Mongoloid'', and ''Australoid''.<ref name=\"Bjfreedman\">{{cite journal|last=Freedman|first=B.

[[Carleton S. Coon]] (1939) included the populations native to all of [[Central Asia|Central]] and Northern Asia, including the [[Ainu people]], under the Caucasoid label. However, many scientists maintained the racial categorizations of color established by Meiners' and Blumenbach's works, along with many other early steps of anthropology, well into the late 19th and mid-to-late 20th centuries, increasingly used to justify political policies, such as segregation and immigration restrictions, and other opinions based in prejudice. For example, [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] (1870) classified all populations of Asian nations as Mongoloid. [[Lothrop Stoddard]] (1920) in turn classified as \"brown\" most of the populations of the Middle East, North Africa, the Horn of Africa, Central Asia and South Asia. He counted as \"white\" only European peoples and their descendants, as well as a few populations in areas adjacent to or opposite southern Europe, in parts of Anatolia and parts of the Rif and Atlas mountains.\n\nIn 1939 Coon argued that the Caucasian race had originated through admixture between ''Homo neanderthalensis'' and ''Homo sapiens'' of the \"Mediterranean type\" which he considered to be distinct from Caucasians, rather than a subtype of it as others had done.<ref name=racesofeurope>{{cite book |last=Coon |first=Carleton |author-link=Carleton S.

The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in ''[[United States v.

This represented a change from the Supreme Court's earlier opinion in ''[[Ozawa v. United States]]'', in which it had expressly approved of two lower court cases holding \"high caste Hindus\" to be \"free white persons\" within the meaning of the naturalization act.

So, why do the rather politically sensitive terms Caucasoid, Mongoloid, or Negroid still appear in published literature (Ousley et al. 2009)? There are considered to be four basic ancestry groups into which an individual can be placed by physical appearance, not accounting for admixture: the sub-Saharan African group (\u201cNegroid\u201d), the European group (\u201cCaucasoid\u201d), the Central Asian group (\u201cMongoloid\u201d), and the Australasian group (\u201cAustraloid\u201d). The rather outdated names of all but one of these groups were originally derived from geography: The Caucasoid group traversed the Caucasus Mountains as they spread into Europe and eastern Asia. Since the majority of native peoples from the Indian subcontinent, northern and northeastern Africa and the Near East fall into this group, to say that the group is of \u201cEuropean\u201d ancestry does not really suffice. Plus, the terms Caucasoid or Caucasian do not have the same oppressive, persecutory connotations as the other terms and so are less likely to cause offense.}}\n*{{cite book|author1=Robert B.

Blumenbach cited Meiners once in 1795, but only to include Meiners's 1793 division of humanity into \"handsome and white\" and \"ugly and dark\" peoples among several alternative \"divisions of the varieties of mankind.\" Yet Blumenbach must have been aware of Meiners's earlier designation of Caucasian and Mongolian branches of humanity, as the two men knew each other as colleagues at the University of G\u00f6ttingen.

It is also associated with notions of racial typology.\n\nBesides its use in anthropology and related fields, the term \"Caucasian\" has often been used in the United States in a different, social context to describe a group commonly called \"[[white people]]\".<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Painter |first=Nell Irvin |authorlink=Nell Irvin Painter |title=Collective Degradation: Slavery and the Construction of Race.

The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in ''[[United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind]]'' (1923) decided that Asian Indians were ineligible for citizenship because, though deemed \"Caucasian\" anthropologically, they were not ''white'' like European descendants since most laypeople did not consider them to be \"white\" people. This represented a change from the Supreme Court's earlier opinion in ''[[Ozawa v. United States]]'', in which it had expressly approved of two lower court cases holding \"high caste Hindus\" to be \"free white persons\" within the meaning of the naturalization act. Government lawyers later recognized that the Supreme Court had \"withdrawn\" this approval in ''Thind''.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Coulson|first1=Doug|title=British Imperialism, the Indian Independence Movement, and the Racial Eligibility Provisions of the Naturalization Act: United States v.

Major changes to immigration law, however, only later came in 1965, when many earlier racial restrictions on immigration were lifted.<ref>[http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5076/ \"Not All Caucasians Are White: The Supreme Court Rejects Citizenship for Asian Indians\"], ''History Matters''</ref> This resulted in confusion about whether American Hispanics are included as \"white\", as the term ''[[Hispanic]]'' originally applied to Spanish heritage but has since expanded to include all people with origins in [[Spanish speaking countries]]. In other countries, the term ''Hispanic'' is not nearly as associated with race, but with the Spanish language and cultural affiliation.\n\nThe [[United States National Library of Medicine]] often used the term \"Caucasian\" as a race in the past. However, it later discontinued such usage in favor of the more narrow geographical term ''European'', which traditionally only applied to a subset of Caucasoids.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Other Notable MeSH Changes and Related Impact on Searching: Ethnic Groups and Geographic Origins |journal=NLM Technical Bulletin |volume=335 |issue=Nov\u2013Dec |pages= |year=2003 |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/techbull/nd03/nd03_med_data_changes.html |quote=The MeSH term Racial Stocks and its four children (Australoid Race, Caucasoid Race, Mongoloid Race, and Negroid Race) have been deleted from MeSH in 2004.
