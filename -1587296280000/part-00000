The earliest known rabbinical school was established by [[Johanan ben Zakai|Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai]] at Yavneh. Other official schools were soon established under different rabbis.

The main difference between the \"beth midrash\" and \"beth hakeneset\" (synagogue) is that the \"beth hakeneset\" is sanctified for prayer only and that even the study of Torah would violate its sanctity while in the \"beth midrash\" both Torah study and prayer are allowed.
