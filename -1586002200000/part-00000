A server [[Host (network)|host]]  runs one or more server programs, which share their resources with clients. A client does not share any of its resources, but it requests content or service from a server. Clients, therefore, initiate communication sessions with servers, which await incoming requests.\nExamples of computer applications that use the client-server model are [[Email]], network printing, and the [[World Wide Web]].\n\n==Client and server role==\nThe ''client-server'' characteristic describes the relationship of cooperating programs in an application. The server component provides a function or service to one or many clients, which initiate requests for such services.\nServers are classified by the services they provide. For example, a [[web server]] serves [[web page]]s and a [[file server]] serves [[computer file]]s. A shared resource may be any of the server computer's software and electronic components, from [[Computer program|programs]] and [[Data (computing)|data]] to [[Microprocessor|processors]] and [[Data storage device|storage devices]]. The sharing of resources of a server constitutes a ''service''.\n\nWhether a computer is a client, a server, or both, is determined by the nature of the application that requires the service functions. For example, a single computer can run a web servers and file server software at the same time to serve different data to clients making different kinds of requests. Client software can also communicate with server software within the same computer.<ref>The [[X Window System]] is one example.</ref> Communication between servers, such as to synchronize data, is sometimes called ''[[inter-server]]'' or ''server-to-server'' communication.\n\n==Client and server communication==\nIn general, a service is an [[Abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]] of computer resources and a client does not have to be [[Concern (computer science)|concerned]] with how the server performs while fulfilling the request and delivering the response. The client only has to understand the response based on the well-known application protocol, i.e. the content and the formatting of the data for the requested service.\n\nClients and servers exchange messages in a [[request\u2013response]] [[messaging pattern]]. The client sends a request, and the server returns a response. This exchange of messages is an example of [[inter-process communication]]. To communicate, the computers must have a common language, and they must follow rules so that both the client and the server know what to expect. The language and rules of communication are defined in a [[communications protocol]]. All client-server protocols operate in the [[application layer]]. The application layer protocol defines the basic patterns of the dialogue. To formalize the data exchange even further, the server may implement an [[application programming interface]] (API).<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Benatallah | first1 = B. | last2 = Casati | first2 = F. | last3 = Toumani | first3 = F. | title = Web service conversation modeling: A cornerstone for e-business automation | doi = 10.1109/MIC.2004.1260703 | journal = IEEE Internet Computing | volume = 8 | pages = 46\u201354 | year = 2004 | pmid =  | pmc = }}</ref> The API is an [[abstraction layer]] for accessing a service.

A computer can only perform a limited number of [[Task (computing)|tasks]] at any moment, and relies on a [[Scheduling (computing)|scheduling]] system to prioritize incoming requests from clients to accommodate them. To prevent abuse and maximize [[uptime|availability]], the server software may limit the availability to clients. [[Denial of service attack]]s are designed to exploit a server's obligation to process requests by overloading it with excessive request rates.\nEncryption should be applied if sensitive information is to be communicated between the client and the server.\n\n==Example==\nWhen a [[bank]] customer accesses [[online banking]] services with a [[web browser]] (the client), the client initiates a request to the bank's web server. The customer's [[login]] credentials may be stored in a [[database]], and the web server accesses the [[database server]] as a client. An [[application server]] interprets the returned data by applying the bank's [[business logic]], and provides the [[Input/output|output]] to the web server. Finally, the webserver returns the result to the client web browser for display.  \n\nIn each step of this sequence of client-server message exchanges, a computer processes a request and returns data. This is the request-response messaging pattern. When all the requests are met, the sequence is complete and the web browser presents the data to the customer.\n\nThis example illustrates a [[design pattern]] applicable to the client\u2013server model: [[separation of concerns]].\n\n==Early history==\nAn early form of client-server architecture is [[remote job entry]], dating at least to [[OS/360]] (announced 1964), where the request was to run a [[job (computing)|job]], and the response was the output.\n\nWhile formulating the client\u2013server model in the 1960s and 1970s, [[computer scientist]]s building [[ARPANET]] (at the [[Stanford Research Institute]]) used the terms ''server-host'' (or ''serving host'') and ''user-host'' (or ''using-host''), and these appear in the early documents RFC 5<ref name=\"rulifson\">{{cite IETF |title=DEL |rfc=5 |last=Rulifson |first=Jeff |authorlink=Jeff Rulifson |date=June 1969 |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] |accessdate=30 November 2013}}</ref> and RFC 4.<ref>{{cite IETF |title=Network Timetable |rfc=4 |last=Shapiro |first=Elmer B. |date=March 1969 |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] |accessdate=30 November 2013}}</ref> This usage was continued at [[Xerox PARC]] in the mid-1970s.\n\nOne context in which researchers used these terms was in the design of a [[computer network programming]] language called Decode-Encode Language (DEL).<ref name=\"rulifson\"/> The purpose of this language was to accept commands from one computer (the user-host), which would return status reports to the user as it encoded the commands in network packets. Another DEL-capable computer, the server-host, received the packets, decoded them, and returned formatted data to the user-host. A DEL program on the user-host received the results to present to the user. This is a client-server transaction. Development of DEL was just beginning in 1969, the year that the [[United States Department of Defense]] established ARPANET (predecessor of [[Internet]]).\n\n===Client-host and server-host===\n''Client-host'' and ''server-host'' have subtly different meanings than ''client'' and ''server''. A host is any computer connected to a network. Whereas the words ''server'' and ''client'' may refer either to a computer or to a computer program, ''server-host'' and ''user-host'' always refer to computers. The host is a versatile, multifunction computer; ''clients'' and ''servers'' are just programs that run on a host. In the client-server model, a server is more likely to be devoted to the task of serving.\n\nAn early use of the word ''client'' occurs in \"Separating Data from Function in a Distributed File System\", a 1978 paper by Xerox PARC computer scientists Howard Sturgis, James Mitchell, and Jay Israel. The authors are careful to define the term for readers, and explain that they use it to distinguish between the user and the user's network node (the client).<ref>{{Cite journal | title=Separating Data from Function in a Distributed File System |last = Sturgis |first = Howard E. |last2 = Mitchell |first2 = James George |last3 = Israel | first3 = Jay E. |publisher=[[Xerox PARC]] |url=http://ip.com/IPCOM/000128883 |year = 1978}}</ref> (By 1992, the word ''server'' had entered into general parlance.)<ref>{{OEtymD|server|accessdate=30 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://getinfo.de/app/Separating-data-from-function-in-a-distributed/id/TIBKAT%3A509976956 |title=Separating data from function in a distributed file system |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website=[[GetInfo]] |publisher=[[German National Library of Science and Technology]] |accessdate=29 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Centralized computing==\n{{Further|History of personal computers|Decentralized computing|Computer cluster}}\n\nThe client\u2013server model does not dictate that server-hosts must have more resources than client-hosts. Rather, it enables any general-purpose computer to extend its capabilities by using the shared resources of other hosts. [[Centralized computing]], however, specifically allocates a large amount of resources to a small number of computers. The more computation is offloaded from client-hosts to the central computers, the simpler the client-hosts can be.<ref name=\"Columbia\">{{cite journal |last1=Nieh |first1=Jason |last2=Yang |first2=S.

The computing power, memory and storage requirements of a server must be scaled appropriately to the expected workload. [[Load balancing (computing)|Load-balancing]] and [[failover]] systems are often employed to scale the server beyond a single physical machine.<ref name=\"Cardellini Colajanni Yu 1999 pp. 28\u201339\">{{cite journal | last=Cardellini | first=V. | last2=Colajanni | first2=M. | last3=Yu | first3=P.S. | title=Dynamic load balancing on Web-server systems | journal=IEEE Internet Computing | publisher=Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) | volume=3 | issue=3 | year=1999 | issn=1089-7801 | doi=10.1109/4236.769420 | pages=28\u201339}}</ref><ref name=\"NGINX 2014\">{{cite web | title=What Is Load Balancing?

Extending southward from the Ancomayo, which is now known as the [[Pat\u00eda River]], in southern present-day [[Colombia]] to the [[Maule River]] in what would later be known as Chile, and eastward from the Pacific Ocean to the edge of the Amazonian jungles, the empire covered some of the most mountainous terrain on Earth.

This vast area of land varied greatly in cultures and in climate. Because of the diverse cultures and geography, the Inca allowed many areas of the empire to be governed under the control of local leaders, who were watched and monitored by Inca officials. Under the administrative mechanisms established by the Inca, all parts of the empire answered to, and were ultimately under the direct control of, the Emperor.<ref name=\"Covey2000\">Covey (2000).</ref> Scholars estimate that the population of the Inca Empire was more than 16,000,000.<ref name=\"Means 1932\">Means (1932).</ref>\n\nSome scholars, such as [[Jared Diamond]], believe that while the Spanish conquest was undoubtedly the proximate cause of the collapse of the Inca Empire, it may very well have been past its peak and already in the process of decline. In 1528, Emperor [[Huayna Capac]] ruled the Inca Empire. He could trace his lineage back to a \"stranger king\" named [[Manco C\u00e1pac]], the mythical founder of the Inca clan,<ref name=Prescott/>{{rp|144}} who according to tradition emerged from a cave in a region called [[Paqariq Tampu]].\n\nHuayna Capac was the son of the previous ruler, [[T\u00fapac Inca]], and the grandson of [[Pachacuti]], the Emperor who, by conquest, had commenced the dramatic expansion of the Inca Empire from its cultural and traditional base in the area around [[Cusco]]. On his accession to the throne, Huayna Capac had continued the policy of expansion by conquest, taking Inca armies north into what is today [[Ecuador]].<ref name=Prescott>[[Prescott, W.H.]], 2011, ''[https://archive.org/details/conquestofperu02presiala The History of the Conquest of Peru],'' Digireads.com Publishing, {{ISBN|978-1420941142}}</ref>{{rp|98}} While he had to put down a number of rebellions during his reign, by the time of his death, his legitimacy was as unquestioned as was the primacy of Inca power.\n\nExpansion had resulted in its own problems. Many parts of the empire maintained distinctive cultures and these were at best reluctant participants in the imperial project. The large extent of the empire, the extremely difficult terrain of much of it, and the fact that all communication and travel had to take place on foot or by boat, seems to have caused increasing difficulty in the Incas' effective administration of the empire.\n\nHuayna Capac relied on his sons to support his reign. While he had many legitimate and illegitimate children (legitimate meaning born of his sister-wife, under the Inca system), two sons are historically important. Prince T\u00fapac Cusi Hualpa, also known as [[Hu\u00e1scar]], was the son of Coya Mama Rahua Occllo of the royal line. The second was [[Atahualpa]], an illegitimate son who was likely born of a daughter of the last independent King of [[Quitu]], one of the states conquered by Huayna Capac during the expansion of the Inca Empire.<ref name=\"Means 1932\" /> These two sons would play pivotal roles in the final years of the Inca Empire.\n\nThe Spanish conquistador Pizarro and his men were greatly aided in their enterprise by invading when the Inca Empire was in the midst of a [[Inca Civil War|war of succession]] between the princes Hu\u00e1scar and Atahualpa.<ref name=\"Prescott\"/>{{rp|143}} Atahualpa seems to have spent more time with Huayna Capac during the years when he was in the north with the army conquering Ecuador. Atahualpa was thus closer to, and had better relations with the army and its leading generals. When both Huayna Capac and his eldest son and designated heir, Ninan Cuyochic, died suddenly in 1528 from what was probably [[smallpox]], a disease introduced by the Spanish into the Americas, the question of who would succeed as emperor was thrown open. Huayna had died before he could nominate the new heir.\n\nAt the time of Huayna Capac's death, Hu\u00e1scar was in the capital Cuzco, while Atahualpa was in Quitu with the main body of the Inca army. Hu\u00e1scar had himself proclaimed [[Sapa Inca]] (i.e. \"Only Emperor\") in Cuzco, but the army declared loyalty to Atahualpa. The resulting dispute led to the [[Inca Civil War]].<ref name=Prescott/>{{rp|146\u2013149}}\n\n== Chronology of the last years of the Inca Empire ==\n{{Campaignbox Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire}}\n\n{{div col}}\n* 1526\u20131529 \u2013 [[Francisco Pizarro]] and [[Diego de Almagro]] make first contact with Inca Empire at [[Tumbes, Peru|Tumbes]], the northernmost Inca stronghold along the coast\n* c. 1528 \u2013 The Inca Emperor Huayna Capac dies from European-introduced [[smallpox]].

Historians are unsure of whether a united Inca Empire could have defeated the Spanish in the long term due to factors such as the high mortality from disease and its related social disruption, and the superior military technology of the conquistadors, who possessed horses, dogs, metal armor, swords, cannons, and primitive, but effective, firearms.<ref name=\"Kubler1945\">Kubler (1945).</ref> Atahualpa appeared to be more popular with the people than his brother, and he was certainly more valued by the army, the core of which was based in the recently conquered northern province of Quitu.\n\nAt the outset of the conflict, each brother controlled his respective domains, with Atahualpa secure in the north, and Hu\u00e1scar controlling the capital of Cuzco and the large territory to the south, including the area around [[Lake Titicaca]]. This region had supplied large numbers of troops for Hu\u00e1scar's forces. After a period of diplomatic posturing and jockeying for position, open warfare broke out. Hu\u00e1scar seemed poised to bring the war to a rapid conclusion, as troops loyal to him took Atahualpa prisoner, while he was attending a festival in the city of [[Tumibamba]]. However, Atahualpa quickly escaped and returned to Quitu. There, he was able to amass what is estimated to be at least 30,000 soldiers. While Hu\u00e1scar managed to muster about the same number of soldiers, they were less experienced.\n\nAtahualpa sent his forces south under the command of two of his leading generals, [[Challcuchima]] and [[Quisquis]], who won an uninterrupted series of victories that soon brought them to the very gates of Cuzco. On the first day of the battle for Cuzco, the forces loyal to Hu\u00e1scar gained an early advantage. However, on the second day, Hu\u00e1scar personally led an ill-advised \"surprise\" attack, of which the generals Challcuchima and Quisquis had advance knowledge. In the ensuing battle, Hu\u00e1scar was captured, and resistance completely collapsed. The victorious generals sent word north by ''chasqui'' messenger to Atahualpa, who had moved south from Quitu to the royal resort springs outside [[Cajamarca]]. The messenger arrived with news of the final victory on the same day that Pizarro and his small band of adventurers, together with some indigenous allies, descended from the Andes into the town of Cajamarca.\n\n== Arrival of Pizarro ==\n\n[[File:Los 13 de la Isla del Gallo.jpg|250px|thumb|The Famous Thirteen by Juan Lepiani]]\n\n[[Francisco Pizarro]] and his brothers ([[Gonzalo Pizarro|Gonzalo]], [[Juan Pizarro (conquistador)|Juan]], and [[Hernando Pizarro|Hernando]]) were attracted by the news of a rich and fabulous kingdom. They had left the then impoverished [[Extremadura]], like many migrants after them.<ref name=Prescott/>{{rp|136}}\n\n{{Cquote|There lies Peru with its riches;<br>Here, Panama and its poverty.<br>Choose, each man, what best becomes a brave Castilian.|15px|15px|Francisco Pizarro<ref name=Prescott/>{{rp|116}}}}\n\nIn 1529, Francisco Pizarro obtained permission from the Spanish Monarchy to conquer the land they called [[Peru]].<ref name=Prescott/>{{rp|133}}\n\nAccording to historian [[Ra\u00fal Porras Barrenechea]], Peru is not a [[Quechua languages|Quechuan]] nor [[Caribbean Spanish|Caribbean]] word, but [[Indo-Hispanic languages|Indo-Hispanic]] or hybrid. Unknown to Pizarro, as he was lobbying for permission to mount an expedition, his proposed enemy was being devastated by the [[Native American disease and epidemics|diseases brought to the American continents]] during earlier Spanish contacts.\n\nWhen Pizarro arrived in Peru in 1532, he found it vastly different from when he had been there just five years before. Amid the ruins of the city of Tumbes, he tried to piece together the situation before him. From two young local boys whom he had taught how to speak Spanish in order to translate for him, Pizarro learned of the civil war and of the disease that was destroying the Inca Empire.<ref name=\"MacQuarrie2007\" />\n\nAfter four long expeditions, Pizarro established the first Spanish settlement in northern Peru, calling it [[Piura|San Miguel de Piura]].<ref name=\"Prescott\"/>{{rp|153\u2013154}}\n\n[[File:Atawallpa Pizarro tinkuy.jpg|thumb|180px|Francisco Pizarro meets with Atahualpa, 1532]]\nWhen first spotted by the natives, Pizarro and his men were thought to be ''viracocha cuna'' or \"gods\". The Natives described Pizarro's men to the Inca. They said that ''capito'' was tall with a full beard and was completely wrapped in clothing. The Natives described the men's swords and how they killed sheep with them. The men did not eat human flesh, but rather sheep, lamb, duck, pigeons, and deer, and cooked the meat. Atahualpa was fearful of what the white men were capable of. If they were ''runa quicachac'' or \"destroyers of peoples,\" then he should flee. If they were ''viracocha cuna runa allichac'' or \"gods who are benefactors of the people,\" then he should not flee, but welcome them.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} The messengers went back to Tangarala, and Atahualpa sent Cinquinchara, an Orejon warrior, to the Spanish to serve as an interpreter.\n\nAfter traveling with the Spanish, Cinquinchara returned to Atahualpa; they discussed whether or not the Spanish men were gods. Cinquinchara decided they were men because he saw them eat, drink, dress, and have relations with women. He saw them produce no miracles. Cinquinchara informed Atahualpa that they were small in number, about 170\u2013180 men, and had bound the Native captives with \"iron ropes\". When Atahualpa asked what to do about the strangers, Cinquinchara said that they should be killed because they were evil thieves who took whatever they wanted, and were ''supai cuna'' or \"devils\". He recommended trapping the men inside of their sleeping quarters and burning them to death.<ref name=\"Betanzos1996\">Betanzos ''et al.'' (1996).</ref>\n\nAt this point, Pizarro had 168 men under his command: 106 on foot and 62 on horses. Pizarro sent his captain Hernando de Soto to invite Atahualpa to a meeting. Soto rode to meet Atahualpa on his horse, an animal that Atahualpa had never seen before. With one of his young interpreters, Soto read a prepared speech to Atahualpa telling him that they had come as servants of God to teach them the truth about God's word.<ref name=\"Seed1991\">Seed (1991).</ref> He said he was speaking to them so that they might \n<blockquote>\"lay the foundation of concord, brotherhood, and perpetual peace that should exist between us, so that you may receive us under your protection and hear the divine law from us and all your people may learn and receive it, for it will be the greatest honor, advantage, and salvation to them all.\"</blockquote>\n\nAtahualpa responded only after [[Hernando Pizarro]] arrived. He replied with what he had heard from his scouts, saying that Pizarro and his men were killing and enslaving countless numbers on the coast. Pizarro denied the report and Atahualpa, with limited information, reluctantly let the matter go. At the end of their meeting, the men agreed to meet the next day at Cajamarca.<ref name=\"MacQuarrie2007\" />\n\n== Capture of Atahualpa ==\nAfter his victory and the death of his brother [[Hu\u00e1scar]], Atahualpa was fasting in the [[Los Ba\u00f1os del Inca District|Inca baths]] outside [[Cajamarca]]. Pizarro and his men reached that city on 15 November 1532.\n\nPizarro sent [[Hernando de Soto (explorer)|Hernando de Soto]] and [[Hernando Pizarro]] to the Inca leader's camp. Hernando Pizarro and De Soto explained they were emissaries of Emperor [[Charles I of Spain]], to offer their services, and \"impart to him the doctrines of the true faith.\"  Additionally, they invited the Incan leader to visit Pizarro at his quarters along the Cajamarca plaza. Atahualpa replied that his fast would end the next day, when he would visit Pizarro. When De Soto noticed Atahualpa's interest in his horse, he put on a display of \"excellent horsemanship\" in close proximity. Atahualpa displayed hospitality by serving refreshments.<ref name=\"Prescott\"/>{{rp|166\u2013170}}<ref name=\"Innes1969\">Innes (1969).</ref>\n\n[[Image:Inca-Spanish confrontation.JPG|thumb|left|The Inca\u2013Spanish confrontation in the [[Battle of Cajamarca]] left thousands of natives dead]]\nThe next morning, Pizarro had arranged an ambuscade around the Cajamarca plaza, where they were to meet. When Atahualpa arrived with about 6,000 unarmed followers, Friar [[Vincente de Valverde]] and [[Felipillo]] met them and proceeded to \"expound the doctrines of the true faith\" ''([[Spanish Requirement of 1513|requerimiento]])'' and seek his tribute as a vassal of King Charles.  The unskilled translator likely contributed to problems in communication. The friar offered Atahualpa the Bible as the authority of what he had just stated. Atahualpa stated, \"I will be no man's tributary.\"<ref name=Prescott/>{{rp|173\u2013177}}\n\nPizarro urged attack starting the [[Battle of Cajamarca]] on 16 November 1532. Though the historical accounts relating to these circumstances vary, the true Spanish motives for the attack seemed to be a desire for loot and flat-out impatience. The Inca likely did not adequately understand the [[conquistador]]s' demands.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Royal Commentaries of the Inca Garcilaso de la Vega |last=Jolas |first=Maria |year=1961 |publisher=Orion Press}}</ref> And, of course, Pizarro knew they did not have the slightest chance against the Inca army unless they captured the Emperor.\n\nAt the signal to attack, the Spaniards unleashed volleys of gunfire at the vulnerable mass of Incas and surged forward in a concerted action. The effect was devastating, the shocked Incas offered such feeble resistance that the battle has often been labeled a [[massacre]], with the Inca losing 2,000 dead. Pizarro also used cavalry charges against the Inca forces, which stunned them in combination with gunfire.<ref name=Prescott/>{{rp|177\u2013179}}\n\nThe majority of Atahualpa's troops were in the Cuzco region along with Quisquis and Challcuchima, the two generals he trusted the most. This was a major disadvantage for the Inca. Their undoing also resulted from a lack of self-confidence, and a desire to make public demonstration of fearlessness and godlike command of situation.<ref name=\"Innes1969\" /> The main view is that the Inca were eventually defeated due to inferior weapons, 'open battle' [[military tactics|tactics]], disease, internal unrest, the bold tactics of the Spanish, and the capture of their emperor.

According to the Spanish envoy's demands, Atahualpa offered to fill a large [[Ransom Room|room with gold]] and promised the Spanish twice that amount in silver. While Pizarro ostensibly accepted this offer and allowed the gold to pile up, he had no intention of releasing the Inca; he needed Atahualpa's influence over his generals and the people in order to maintain the peace.\n\nWhen Atahualpa was captured at the massacre at Cajamarca, he was treated with respect, allowed his wives to join him, and the Spanish soldiers taught him the game of [[chess]].<ref name=Leon>Leon, P., 1998, ''The Discovery and Conquest of Peru, Chronicles of the New World Encounter,'' edited and translated by Cook and Cook, Durham: Duke University Press, {{ISBN|9780822321460}}</ref>{{rp|215,234}} \nFrancisco Pizarro sent his brother Hernando to gather gold and silver from the temples in [[Pachacamac]] in January 1533, and on his return in March,<ref name=Leon/>{{rp|237}} captured Chalcuchimac in the [[Jauja]] Valley.

False interpretations from the interpreter Felipillo made the Spaniards paranoid. They were told that Atahualpa had ordered secret attacks and his warriors were hidden in the surrounding area. Soto went with a small army to look for the hidden army, but a trial for Atahualpa was held in his absence. Among the charges were polygamy, incestuous marriage, and idolatry, all frowned upon in Catholicism but common in Inca culture and religion.\n\nThe men who were against Atahualpa's conviction and murder argued that he should be judged by King Charles since he was the sovereign prince. Atahualpa agreed to accept baptism to avoid being burned at the stake and in the hopes of one day rejoining his army and killing the Spanish; he was baptized as Francisco. On 29 August 1533 Atahualpa was [[garrotted]] and died a Christian. He was buried with Christian rites in the church of San Francisco at Cajamarca, but was soon disinterred. His body was taken, probably at his prior request, to its final resting place in Quito.

Rumi\u00f1ahui fell back to Quito, and, while in pursuit of the Inca army, Benalc\u00e1zar was joined by five hundred men led by Guatemalan Governor [[Pedro de Alvarado]]. Greedy for gold, Alvarado had set sail for the south without the crown's authorization, landed on the Ecuadorian coast, and marched inland to the Sierra.

He began his rule as an ally of the Spanish and was respected in the southern regions of the empire, but there was still much unrest in the north near Quito where Atahualpa's generals were amassing troops. Atahualpa's death meant that there was no hostage left to deter these northern armies from attacking the invaders.

Many Inca attempts to regain the empire had occurred, but none had been successful.

Spanish royal authority on these territories was consolidated by the creation of an [[Audiencia Real]], a type of [[appellate court]]. In January 1535, [[Lima]] was founded, from which the political and administrative institutions were to be organized. In 1542, the Spanish created the Viceroyalty of New Castile, that shortly after would be called [[Viceroyalty of Peru]]. Nevertheless, the Viceroyalty of Peru was not organized until the arrival of a later Viceroy [[Francisco de Toledo]] in 1572. [[Francisco de Toledo|Toledo]] ended the indigenous [[Neo-Inca State]] in Vilcabamba, executing the Inca [[T\u00fapac Amaru]]. He promoted economic development using commercial monopoly and built up the extraction from the silver mines of [[Potos\u00ed]], using slavery based on the Inca institution of forced labor for mandatory public service called ''[[Mita (Inca)|mita]]''.\n\nThe integration of Spanish culture into Peru was carried out not only by Pizarro and his other captains, but also by the many Spanish who also came to Peru to exploit its riches and inhabit its land.  These included many different kinds of immigrants such as Spanish merchants, peasants, artisans, and Spanish women.

The unique indigenous road and communications systems were essentially lost.  The only things that persisted of the original culture are the very few artifacts that remained and the minute cultural aspects, such as language, that was left behind by the small percentage of Incas who persisted. (survived){{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n=== Effects of the conquest on the people of Peru ===\nThe long-term effects of the arrival of the Spanish on the population of South America were simply catastrophic. While this is the case for every group of Native-Americans that were invaded by Europeans from the fifteenth century onwards, the Incan population suffered a dramatic and quick decline following contact. It is estimated that parts of the empire, notably the Central Andes, suffered a population decline ratio of 58:1 during the years of 1520\u20131571.<ref name=\"Newson1985\">Newson (1985).</ref>\n\nThe single greatest cause of the decimation of native populations was infectious disease. Old World Eurasian diseases, which had long been endemic on the Continent, were carried by colonists and conquistadors. As these were new to the natives, they had no acquired immunity and suffered very high rates of death. More died of disease than any army or armed conflict.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/gunsgermssteel/variables/smallpox.html The Story Of... Smallpox \u2013 and other Deadly Eurasian Germs]</ref> As the Inca did not have as strong a writing tradition as the Aztec or Maya, it is difficult for historians to estimate population decline or any events after conquest. But, it is sometimes argued, and equally disputed among scholars. that the Inca began to contract these diseases several years before the Spanish appeared in the region, as it was possibly carried to their empire by traders and travelers. The outbreak, argued to be hemorrhagic [[smallpox]], reached the Andes in 1524. While numbers are unavailable, Spanish records indicate that the population was so devastated by disease that they could hardly resist the foreign forces.\n\nHistorians differ as to whether the illness of the 1520s was smallpox; a minority of scholars claim that the epidemic was due to an indigenous illness called Carrion's disease. In any case, a 1981 study by N. D. Cook the shows that the Andes suffered from three separate population declines during colonization. The first was of 30\u201350 percent during the first outbreak of [[smallpox]]. When a [[measles]] outbreak occurred, there was another decline of 25\u201330 percent. Finally, when smallpox and measles epidemics occurred together, which occurred from 1585 to 1591, a decline of 30\u201360 percent occurred. Collectively these declines amounted to a decline of 93 percent from the pre-contact population in the Andes region.<ref name=\"Lovell1992\">Lovell (1992).</ref> Mortality was particularly high among children, ensuring that the impact of the epidemics would extend to the next generation.<ref name=\"Andrien2001\" />\n\nBeyond the devastation of the local populations by disease, they suffered considerable enslavement, pillaging and destruction from warfare. The Spanish took thousands of women from the local natives to use as servants and concubines. As Pizarro and his men took over portions of South America, they plundered and enslaved countless people. Some local populations entered into vassalage willingly, to defeat the Inca. Native groups such as the [[Huanca people|Huanca]], [[Ca\u00f1ari]], [[Chanka]] and [[Chachapoya culture|Chachapoya]] fought alongside the Spanish as they opposed Inca rule. The basic policy of the Spanish towards local populations was that voluntary vassalage would yield safety and coexistence, while continued resistance would result in more deaths and destruction.<ref name=\"Gibson1978\">Gibson (1978).</ref>\n\nAnother significant effect on the people in South America was the spread of Christianity. As Pizarro and the Spanish subdued the continent and brought it under their control, they forcefully converted many to Christianity, claiming to have educated them in the ways of the \"one true religion.\"<ref name=\"Andagoya\">{{cite web|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Narrative_of_the_Proceedings_of_Pedrarias_Davila/Narrative_of_Pascual_de_Andagoya|title=Narrative of the Proceedings of Pedrarias Davila|first=Pascual de|last=Andagoya|publisher=The Hakluyt Society|accessdate=21 June 2019|via=Wikisource}}</ref><ref name=\"Navarette\">{{cite book|last=de Navarette|first=Martin Fernadez|title=Viages menores, y los de Vespucio; Poblaciones en el Darien, suplemento al tomo II|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mWuiNQy_PDQC&pg=PA426|year=1829|language=es}}</ref> With the depopulation of the local populations along with the capitulation of the Inca Empire, the Spanish missionary work after colonization began was able to continue unimpeded.

Extending southward from the Ancomayo, which is now known as the [[Pat\u00eda River]], in southern present-day [[Colombia]] to the [[Maule River]] in what would later be known as Chile, and eastward from the Pacific Ocean to the edge of the Amazonian jungles, the empire covered some of the most mountainous terrain on Earth.

This vast area of land varied greatly in cultures and in climate. Because of the diverse cultures and geography, the Inca allowed many areas of the empire to be governed under the control of local leaders, who were watched and monitored by Inca officials. Under the administrative mechanisms established by the Inca, all parts of the empire answered to, and were ultimately under the direct control of, the Emperor.<ref name=\"Covey2000\">Covey (2000).</ref> Scholars estimate that the population of the Inca Empire was more than 16,000,000.<ref name=\"Means 1932\">Means (1932).</ref>\n\nSome scholars, such as [[Jared Diamond]], believe that while the Spanish conquest was undoubtedly the proximate cause of the collapse of the Inca Empire, it may very well have been past its peak and already in the process of decline. In 1528, Emperor [[Huayna Capac]] ruled the Inca Empire. He could trace his lineage back to a \"stranger king\" named [[Manco C\u00e1pac]], the mythical founder of the Inca clan,<ref name=Prescott/>{{rp|144}} who according to tradition emerged from a cave in a region called [[Paqariq Tampu]].\n\nHuayna Capac was the son of the previous ruler, [[T\u00fapac Inca]], and the grandson of [[Pachacuti]], the Emperor who, by conquest, had commenced the dramatic expansion of the Inca Empire from its cultural and traditional base in the area around [[Cusco]]. On his accession to the throne, Huayna Capac had continued the policy of expansion by conquest, taking Inca armies north into what is today [[Ecuador]].<ref name=Prescott>[[Prescott, W.H.]], 2011, ''[https://archive.org/details/conquestofperu02presiala The History of the Conquest of Peru],'' Digireads.com Publishing, {{ISBN|978-1420941142}}</ref>{{rp|98}} While he had to put down a number of rebellions during his reign, by the time of his death, his legitimacy was as unquestioned as was the primacy of Inca power.\n\nExpansion had resulted in its own problems. Many parts of the empire maintained distinctive cultures and these were at best reluctant participants in the imperial project. The large extent of the empire, the extremely difficult terrain of much of it, and the fact that all communication and travel had to take place on foot or by boat, seems to have caused increasing difficulty in the Incas' effective administration of the empire.\n\nHuayna Capac relied on his sons to support his reign. While he had many legitimate and illegitimate children (legitimate meaning born of his sister-wife, under the Inca system), two sons are historically important. Prince T\u00fapac Cusi Hualpa, also known as [[Hu\u00e1scar]], was the son of Coya Mama Rahua Occllo of the royal line. The second was [[Atahualpa]], an illegitimate son who was likely born of a daughter of the last independent King of [[Quitu]], one of the states conquered by Huayna Capac during the expansion of the Inca Empire.<ref name=\"Means 1932\" /> These two sons would play pivotal roles in the final years of the Inca Empire.\n\nThe Spanish conquistador Pizarro and his men were greatly aided in their enterprise by invading when the Inca Empire was in the midst of a [[Inca Civil War|war of succession]] between the princes Hu\u00e1scar and Atahualpa.<ref name=\"Prescott\"/>{{rp|143}} Atahualpa seems to have spent more time with Huayna Capac during the years when he was in the north with the army conquering Ecuador. Atahualpa was thus closer to, and had better relations with the army and its leading generals. When both Huayna Capac and his eldest son and designated heir, Ninan Cuyochic, died suddenly in 1528 from what was probably [[smallpox]], a disease introduced by the Spanish into the Americas, the question of who would succeed as emperor was thrown open. Huayna had died before he could nominate the new heir.\n\nAt the time of Huayna Capac's death, Hu\u00e1scar was in the capital Cuzco, while Atahualpa was in Quitu with the main body of the Inca army. Hu\u00e1scar had himself proclaimed [[Sapa Inca]] (i.e. \"Only Emperor\") in Cuzco, but the army declared loyalty to Atahualpa.

Historians are unsure of whether a united Inca Empire could have defeated the Spanish in the long term due to factors such as the high mortality from disease and its related social disruption, and the superior military technology of the conquistadors, who possessed horses, dogs, metal armor, swords, cannons, and primitive, but effective, firearms.<ref name=\"Kubler1945\">Kubler (1945).</ref> Atahualpa appeared to be more popular with the people than his brother, and he was certainly more valued by the army, the core of which was based in the recently conquered northern province of Quitu.\n\nAt the outset of the conflict, each brother controlled his respective domains, with Atahualpa secure in the north, and Hu\u00e1scar controlling the capital of Cuzco and the large territory to the south, including the area around [[Lake Titicaca]]. This region had supplied large numbers of troops for Hu\u00e1scar's forces. After a period of diplomatic posturing and jockeying for position, open warfare broke out. Hu\u00e1scar seemed poised to bring the war to a rapid conclusion, as troops loyal to him took Atahualpa prisoner, while he was attending a festival in the city of [[Tumibamba]]. However, Atahualpa quickly escaped and returned to Quitu. There, he was able to amass what is estimated to be at least 30,000 soldiers. While Hu\u00e1scar managed to muster about the same number of soldiers, they were less experienced.\n\nAtahualpa sent his forces south under the command of two of his leading generals, [[Challcuchima]] and [[Quisquis]], who won an uninterrupted series of victories that soon brought them to the very gates of Cuzco. On the first day of the battle for Cuzco, the forces loyal to Hu\u00e1scar gained an early advantage. However, on the second day, Hu\u00e1scar personally led an ill-advised \"surprise\" attack, of which the generals Challcuchima and Quisquis had advance knowledge. In the ensuing battle, Hu\u00e1scar was captured, and resistance completely collapsed. The victorious generals sent word north by ''chasqui'' messenger to Atahualpa, who had moved south from Quitu to the royal resort springs outside [[Cajamarca]]. The messenger arrived with news of the final victory on the same day that Pizarro and his small band of adventurers, together with some indigenous allies, descended from the Andes into the town of Cajamarca.\n\n== Arrival of Pizarro ==\n\n[[File:Los 13 de la Isla del Gallo.jpg|250px|thumb|The Famous Thirteen by Juan Lepiani]]\n\n[[Francisco Pizarro]] and his brothers ([[Gonzalo Pizarro|Gonzalo]], [[Juan Pizarro (conquistador)|Juan]], and [[Hernando Pizarro|Hernando]]) were attracted by the news of a rich and fabulous kingdom.

Unknown to Pizarro, as he was lobbying for permission to mount an expedition, his proposed enemy was being devastated by the [[Native American disease and epidemics|diseases brought to the American continents]] during earlier Spanish contacts.\n\nWhen Pizarro arrived in Peru in 1532, he found it vastly different from when he had been there just five years before. Amid the ruins of the city of Tumbes, he tried to piece together the situation before him. From two young local boys whom he had taught how to speak Spanish in order to translate for him, Pizarro learned of the civil war and of the disease that was destroying the Inca Empire.<ref name=\"MacQuarrie2007\" />\n\nAfter four long expeditions, Pizarro established the first Spanish settlement in northern Peru, calling it [[Piura|San Miguel de Piura]].<ref name=\"Prescott\"/>{{rp|153\u2013154}}\n\n[[File:Atawallpa Pizarro tinkuy.jpg|thumb|180px|Francisco Pizarro meets with Atahualpa, 1532]]\nWhen first spotted by the natives, Pizarro and his men were thought to be ''viracocha cuna'' or \"gods\". The Natives described Pizarro's men to the Inca. They said that ''capito'' was tall with a full beard and was completely wrapped in clothing. The Natives described the men's swords and how they killed sheep with them. The men did not eat human flesh, but rather sheep, lamb, duck, pigeons, and deer, and cooked the meat. Atahualpa was fearful of what the white men were capable of. If they were ''runa quicachac'' or \"destroyers of peoples,\" then he should flee. If they were ''viracocha cuna runa allichac'' or \"gods who are benefactors of the people,\" then he should not flee, but welcome them.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} The messengers went back to Tangarala, and Atahualpa sent Cinquinchara, an Orejon warrior, to the Spanish to serve as an interpreter.\n\nAfter traveling with the Spanish, Cinquinchara returned to Atahualpa; they discussed whether or not the Spanish men were gods. Cinquinchara decided they were men because he saw them eat, drink, dress, and have relations with women. He saw them produce no miracles. Cinquinchara informed Atahualpa that they were small in number, about 170\u2013180 men, and had bound the Native captives with \"iron ropes\". When Atahualpa asked what to do about the strangers, Cinquinchara said that they should be killed because they were evil thieves who took whatever they wanted, and were ''supai cuna'' or \"devils\". He recommended trapping the men inside of their sleeping quarters and burning them to death.<ref name=\"Betanzos1996\">Betanzos ''et al.'' (1996).</ref>\n\nAt this point, Pizarro had 168 men under his command: 106 on foot and 62 on horses. Pizarro sent his captain Hernando de Soto to invite Atahualpa to a meeting. Soto rode to meet Atahualpa on his horse, an animal that Atahualpa had never seen before. With one of his young interpreters, Soto read a prepared speech to Atahualpa telling him that they had come as servants of God to teach them the truth about God's word.<ref name=\"Seed1991\">Seed (1991).</ref> He said he was speaking to them so that they might \n<blockquote>\"lay the foundation of concord, brotherhood, and perpetual peace that should exist between us, so that you may receive us under your protection and hear the divine law from us and all your people may learn and receive it, for it will be the greatest honor, advantage, and salvation to them all.\"</blockquote>\n\nAtahualpa responded only after [[Hernando Pizarro]] arrived. He replied with what he had heard from his scouts, saying that Pizarro and his men were killing and enslaving countless numbers on the coast. Pizarro denied the report and Atahualpa, with limited information, reluctantly let the matter go. At the end of their meeting, the men agreed to meet the next day at Cajamarca.<ref name=\"MacQuarrie2007\" />\n\n== Capture of Atahualpa ==\nAfter his victory and the death of his brother [[Hu\u00e1scar]], Atahualpa was fasting in the [[Los Ba\u00f1os del Inca District|Inca baths]] outside [[Cajamarca]]. Pizarro and his men reached that city on 15 November 1532.\n\nPizarro sent [[Hernando de Soto (explorer)|Hernando de Soto]] and [[Hernando Pizarro]] to the Inca leader's camp. Hernando Pizarro and De Soto explained they were emissaries of Emperor [[Charles I of Spain]], to offer their services, and \"impart to him the doctrines of the true faith.\"  Additionally, they invited the Incan leader to visit Pizarro at his quarters along the Cajamarca plaza. Atahualpa replied that his fast would end the next day, when he would visit Pizarro. When De Soto noticed Atahualpa's interest in his horse, he put on a display of \"excellent horsemanship\" in close proximity. Atahualpa displayed hospitality by serving refreshments.<ref name=\"Prescott\"/>{{rp|166\u2013170}}<ref name=\"Innes1969\">Innes (1969).</ref>\n\n[[Image:Inca-Spanish confrontation.JPG|thumb|left|The Inca\u2013Spanish confrontation in the [[Battle of Cajamarca]] left thousands of natives dead]]\nThe next morning, Pizarro had arranged an ambuscade around the Cajamarca plaza, where they were to meet. When Atahualpa arrived with about 6,000 unarmed followers, Friar [[Vincente de Valverde]] and [[Felipillo]] met them and proceeded to \"expound the doctrines of the true faith\" ''([[Spanish Requirement of 1513|requerimiento]])'' and seek his tribute as a vassal of King Charles.  The unskilled translator likely contributed to problems in communication. The friar offered Atahualpa the Bible as the authority of what he had just stated. Atahualpa stated, \"I will be no man's tributary.\"<ref name=Prescott/>{{rp|173\u2013177}}\n\nPizarro urged attack starting the [[Battle of Cajamarca]] on 16 November 1532. Though the historical accounts relating to these circumstances vary, the true Spanish motives for the attack seemed to be a desire for loot and flat-out impatience. The Inca likely did not adequately understand the [[conquistador]]s' demands.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Royal Commentaries of the Inca Garcilaso de la Vega |last=Jolas |first=Maria |year=1961 |publisher=Orion Press}}</ref> And, of course, Pizarro knew they did not have the slightest chance against the Inca army unless they captured the Emperor.\n\nAt the signal to attack, the Spaniards unleashed volleys of gunfire at the vulnerable mass of Incas and surged forward in a concerted action. The effect was devastating, the shocked Incas offered such feeble resistance that the battle has often been labeled a [[massacre]], with the Inca losing 2,000 dead. Pizarro also used cavalry charges against the Inca forces, which stunned them in combination with gunfire.<ref name=Prescott/>{{rp|177\u2013179}}\n\nThe majority of Atahualpa's troops were in the Cuzco region along with Quisquis and Challcuchima, the two generals he trusted the most. This was a major disadvantage for the Inca. Their undoing also resulted from a lack of self-confidence, and a desire to make public demonstration of fearlessness and godlike command of situation.<ref name=\"Innes1969\" /> The main view is that the Inca were eventually defeated due to inferior weapons, 'open battle' [[military tactics|tactics]], disease, internal unrest, the bold tactics of the Spanish, and the capture of their emperor.

According to the Spanish envoy's demands, Atahualpa offered to fill a large [[Ransom Room|room with gold]] and promised the Spanish twice that amount in silver. While Pizarro ostensibly accepted this offer and allowed the gold to pile up, he had no intention of releasing the Inca; he needed Atahualpa's influence over his generals and the people in order to maintain the peace.\n\nWhen Atahualpa was captured at the massacre at Cajamarca, he was treated with respect, allowed his wives to join him, and the Spanish soldiers taught him the game of [[chess]].<ref name=Leon>Leon, P., 1998, ''The Discovery and Conquest of Peru, Chronicles of the New World Encounter,'' edited and translated by Cook and Cook, Durham: Duke University Press, {{ISBN|9780822321460}}</ref>{{rp|215,234}} \nFrancisco Pizarro sent his brother Hernando to gather gold and silver from the temples in [[Pachacamac]] in January 1533, and on his return in March,<ref name=Leon/>{{rp|237}} captured Chalcuchimac in the [[Jauja]] Valley.

False interpretations from the interpreter Felipillo made the Spaniards paranoid. They were told that Atahualpa had ordered secret attacks and his warriors were hidden in the surrounding area. Soto went with a small army to look for the hidden army, but a trial for Atahualpa was held in his absence. Among the charges were polygamy, incestuous marriage, and idolatry, all frowned upon in Catholicism but common in Inca culture and religion.\n\nThe men who were against Atahualpa's conviction and murder argued that he should be judged by King Charles since he was the sovereign prince. Atahualpa agreed to accept baptism to avoid being burned at the stake and in the hopes of one day rejoining his army and killing the Spanish; he was baptized as Francisco. On 29 August 1533 Atahualpa was [[garrotted]] and died a Christian. He was buried with Christian rites in the church of San Francisco at Cajamarca, but was soon disinterred. His body was taken, probably at his prior request, to its final resting place in Quito.

Rumi\u00f1ahui fell back to Quito, and, while in pursuit of the Inca army, Benalc\u00e1zar was joined by five hundred men led by Guatemalan Governor [[Pedro de Alvarado]]. Greedy for gold, Alvarado had set sail for the south without the crown's authorization, landed on the Ecuadorian coast, and marched inland to the Sierra.

He began his rule as an ally of the Spanish and was respected in the southern regions of the empire, but there was still much unrest in the north near Quito where Atahualpa's generals were amassing troops. Atahualpa's death meant that there was no hostage left to deter these northern armies from attacking the invaders.

His son, [[T\u00fapac Amaru]], was the last Inca. After deadly confrontations, he was murdered by the Spanish in 1572.\n\nIn total, the conquest took about forty years to complete. Many Inca attempts to regain the empire had occurred, but none had been successful. Thus the Spanish conquest was achieved through relentless force, and deception, aided by factors like smallpox and a great communication and cultural divide. The Spaniards destroyed much of the Incan culture and introduced the Spanish culture to the native population.\n\n== Aftermath ==\n[[Image:Pizarro in Lima.JPG|thumb|upright|Pizarro and his followers founding Lima]]\nA struggle for power resulted in a long civil war between Francisco Pizarro and Diego de Almagro in which Almagro was killed.

Spanish royal authority on these territories was consolidated by the creation of an [[Audiencia Real]], a type of [[appellate court]]. In January 1535, [[Lima]] was founded, from which the political and administrative institutions were to be organized. In 1542, the Spanish created the Viceroyalty of New Castile, that shortly after would be called [[Viceroyalty of Peru]]. Nevertheless, the Viceroyalty of Peru was not organized until the arrival of a later Viceroy [[Francisco de Toledo]] in 1572. [[Francisco de Toledo|Toledo]] ended the indigenous [[Neo-Inca State]] in Vilcabamba, executing the Inca [[T\u00fapac Amaru]]. He promoted economic development using commercial monopoly and built up the extraction from the silver mines of [[Potos\u00ed]], using slavery based on the Inca institution of forced labor for mandatory public service called ''[[Mita (Inca)|mita]]''.\n\nThe integration of Spanish culture into Peru was carried out not only by Pizarro and his other captains, but also by the many Spanish who also came to Peru to exploit its riches and inhabit its land.  These included many different kinds of immigrants such as Spanish merchants, peasants, artisans, and Spanish women. Another element that the Spanish brought with them were African [[slaves]] to work alongside captive Incas for use in labor with things such as agriculture and mining for silver.<ref name=\"Lockhart\">Lockhart, James.

(survived){{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n=== Effects of the conquest on the people of Peru ===\nThe long-term effects of the arrival of the Spanish on the population of South America were simply catastrophic. While this is the case for every group of Native-Americans that were invaded by Europeans from the fifteenth century onwards, the Incan population suffered a dramatic and quick decline following contact. It is estimated that parts of the empire, notably the Central Andes, suffered a population decline ratio of 58:1 during the years of 1520\u20131571.<ref name=\"Newson1985\">Newson (1985).</ref>\n\nThe single greatest cause of the decimation of native populations was infectious disease. Old World Eurasian diseases, which had long been endemic on the Continent, were carried by colonists and conquistadors. As these were new to the natives, they had no acquired immunity and suffered very high rates of death. More died of disease than any army or armed conflict.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/gunsgermssteel/variables/smallpox.html The Story Of... Smallpox \u2013 and other Deadly Eurasian Germs]</ref> As the Inca did not have as strong a writing tradition as the Aztec or Maya, it is difficult for historians to estimate population decline or any events after conquest. But, it is sometimes argued, and equally disputed among scholars. that the Inca began to contract these diseases several years before the Spanish appeared in the region, as it was possibly carried to their empire by traders and travelers. The outbreak, argued to be hemorrhagic [[smallpox]], reached the Andes in 1524. While numbers are unavailable, Spanish records indicate that the population was so devastated by disease that they could hardly resist the foreign forces.\n\nHistorians differ as to whether the illness of the 1520s was smallpox; a minority of scholars claim that the epidemic was due to an indigenous illness called Carrion's disease. In any case, a 1981 study by N. D. Cook the shows that the Andes suffered from three separate population declines during colonization. The first was of 30\u201350 percent during the first outbreak of [[smallpox]]. When a [[measles]] outbreak occurred, there was another decline of 25\u201330 percent. Finally, when smallpox and measles epidemics occurred together, which occurred from 1585 to 1591, a decline of 30\u201360 percent occurred. Collectively these declines amounted to a decline of 93 percent from the pre-contact population in the Andes region.<ref name=\"Lovell1992\">Lovell (1992).</ref> Mortality was particularly high among children, ensuring that the impact of the epidemics would extend to the next generation.<ref name=\"Andrien2001\" />\n\nBeyond the devastation of the local populations by disease, they suffered considerable enslavement, pillaging and destruction from warfare. The Spanish took thousands of women from the local natives to use as servants and concubines. As Pizarro and his men took over portions of South America, they plundered and enslaved countless people. Some local populations entered into vassalage willingly, to defeat the Inca. Native groups such as the [[Huanca people|Huanca]], [[Ca\u00f1ari]], [[Chanka]] and [[Chachapoya culture|Chachapoya]] fought alongside the Spanish as they opposed Inca rule.

So that when they discovered that we were thieves and men who sought to force their wives and daughters to commit sin with them, they despised us.

Until 1830, elephants were so plentiful that their destruction was encouraged by the government, and rewards were paid for any that was killed. In the first half of the 19th century, forests in the montane zone were cleared large-scale for the planting of [[Coffee plantation|coffee]], and afterwards [[Tea plant|tea]].

Until 1830, elephants were so plentiful that their destruction was encouraged by the government, and rewards were paid for any that was killed. In the first half of the 19th century, forests in the montane zone were cleared large-scale for the planting of [[Coffee plantation|coffee]], and afterwards [[Tea plant|tea]].

The memorial is sited near the corner of 3rd and D Streets NW in the [[Judiciary Square]] neighborhood.  The memorial's two bronze figures were sculpted by [[Gaetano Trentanove]], an Italian-American artist responsible for another Washington, D.C. sculptural landmark, the [[Daniel Webster Memorial]].  The dedication ceremony in 1901 was attended by thousands of Masons who marched in a celebratory parade.\n\nThe Pike memorial is the only [[outdoor sculpture in Washington, D.C.]] honoring a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] general.  Though Pike is depicted as a Mason, not a soldier, the memorial has often stirred controversy.  The memorial is one of [[Civil War Monuments in Washington, D.C.|18 Civil War monuments in Washington, D.C.]], which were collectively listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1978.  The memorial is owned and maintained by the [[National Park Service]], a federal agency of the [[United States Department of the Interior|Interior Department]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Background===\n[[Albert Pike]] (1809\u20131891) was a [[Massachusetts]] native who became a schoolteacher and [[American frontier|frontiersman]] before settling in [[Arkansas]].  There he began teaching again and continued to write poetry, a lifelong passion.  His letters to local newspapers led to a job offer as editor for the ''Arkansas Advocate'', a newspaper in [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]] affiliated with the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]].  Pike later became a successful lawyer specializing in [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] claims against the U.S. government.  He served as a captain in the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] and resumed his legal practice following the war.  In the 1850s, Pike switched his allegiance to the [[Know Nothing|Know Nothing Party]] due to the Whig Party's reluctance to embrace [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and sided with the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] when Southern states seceded from the United States in 1861.  During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Pike's knowledge of Native Americans led to him being commissioned a [[brigadier general]] in the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate Army]].  He assembled an [[Indian cavalry]] loyal to the Confederacy and led them in battle at [[Battle of Pea Ridge|Pea Ridge]], where his poor leadership and inability to keep the cavalry engaged with the enemy was a contributing factor to the Confederate's loss.  Alleged atrocities committed by his troops include the [[scalping]] of captured enemy combatants.  A few months after the battle, Pike resigned from the army and resumed practicing law.  Following the war, Pike settled in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Tennessee]], where it was rumored he became involved with the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK), though no definitive evidence proves his relationship with the organization.<ref name=jacob>{{cite book | title=Testament to Union: Civil War Monuments in Washington, D.C. | publisher=JHU Press | author=Jacob, Kathryn Allamong | year=1998 | location=JHU Press | pages=59\u201362 | isbn=9780801858611}}</ref><ref name=moneyhon>{{cite web | url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=1737 | title=Albert Pike (1809\u20131891) | publisher=Central Arkansas Library System | work=Encyclopedia of Arkansas History & Culture | accessdate=November 26, 2015 | author=Moneyhon, Carl H.}}</ref><ref name=loewen>{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/07/01/why-do-people-believe-myths-about-the-confederacy-because-our-textbooks-and-monuments-are-wrong/ | title=Why do people believe myths about the Confederacy?

Pike had become a [[Freemasonry|Mason]] in 1850 and quickly rose up its ranks, becoming the SGC in 1859.  He rewrote and interpreted Masonic rituals and compiled the Southern Jurisdiction's first philosophical document, ''[[Morals and Dogma of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry]]'', an influential book in the organization.

The memorial is sited near the corner of 3rd and D Streets NW in the [[Judiciary Square]] neighborhood.  The memorial's two bronze figures were sculpted by [[Gaetano Trentanove]], an Italian-American artist responsible for another Washington, D.C. sculptural landmark, the [[Daniel Webster Memorial]].  The dedication ceremony in 1901 was attended by thousands of Masons who marched in a celebratory parade.\n\nThe Pike memorial is the only [[outdoor sculpture in Washington, D.C.]] honoring a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] general.  Though Pike is depicted as a Mason, not a soldier, the memorial has often stirred controversy.  The memorial is one of [[Civil War Monuments in Washington, D.C.|18 Civil War monuments in Washington, D.C.]], which were collectively listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1978.  The memorial is owned and maintained by the [[National Park Service]], a federal agency of the [[United States Department of the Interior|Interior Department]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Background===\n[[Albert Pike]] (1809&ndash;1891) was a [[Massachusetts]] native who became a schoolteacher and [[American frontier|frontiersman]] before settling in [[Arkansas]].  There he began teaching again and continued to write poetry, a lifelong passion.  His letters to local newspapers led to a job offer as editor for the ''Arkansas Advocate'', a newspaper in [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]] affiliated with the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]].  Pike later became a successful lawyer specializing in [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] claims against the U.S. government.  He served as a captain in the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] and resumed his legal practice following the war.  In the 1850s, Pike switched his allegiance to the [[Know Nothing|Know Nothing Party]] due to the Whig Party's reluctance to embrace [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and sided with the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] when Southern states seceded from the United States in 1861.  During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Pike's knowledge of Native Americans led to him being commissioned a [[brigadier general]] in the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate Army]].  He assembled an [[Indian cavalry]] loyal to the Confederacy and led them in battle at [[Battle of Pea Ridge|Pea Ridge]], where his poor leadership and inability to keep the cavalry engaged with the enemy was a contributing factor to the Confederate's loss.  Alleged atrocities committed by his troops include the [[scalping]] of captured enemy combatants.  A few months after the battle, Pike resigned from the army and resumed practicing law.  Following the war, Pike settled in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Tennessee]], where it was rumored he became involved with the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK), though no definitive evidence proves his relationship with the organization.<ref name=jacob>{{cite book | title=Testament to Union: Civil War Monuments in Washington, D.C. | publisher=JHU Press | author=Jacob, Kathryn Allamong | year=1998 | location=JHU Press | pages=59\u201362 | isbn=9780801858611}}</ref><ref name=moneyhon>{{cite web | url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=1737 | title=Albert Pike (1809\u20131891) | publisher=Central Arkansas Library System | work=Encyclopedia of Arkansas History & Culture | accessdate=November 26, 2015 | author=Moneyhon, Carl H.}}</ref><ref name=loewen>{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/07/01/why-do-people-believe-myths-about-the-confederacy-because-our-textbooks-and-monuments-are-wrong/ | title=Why do people believe myths about the Confederacy?

Pike had become a [[Freemasonry|Mason]] in 1850 and quickly rose up its ranks, becoming the SGC in 1859.  He rewrote and interpreted Masonic rituals and compiled the Southern Jurisdiction's first philosophical document, ''[[Morals and Dogma of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry]]'', an influential book in the organization.  Pike continued serving as SGC until his death in 1891.<ref name=moneyhon/>  Pike once stated \"When I am dead, I wish my monument to be builded only in the hearts and memories of my brethren of the Ancient and Accepted Rite\", but a few years after his death, Masons began plans for a monument in the nation's capital.<ref name=jacob/>\n\nThe SCJC chose Italian-American artist [[Gaetano Trentanove]] to sculpt the memorial.

There is not a jot of reliable proof that Albert Pike was ever a member, much less an officer, of the Klan.\"  Boettjer also claimed a LaRouche video promised the [[Arab\u2013Israeli conflict|Middle East conflict]] would be solved and [[World War III]] averted if the statue was removed.<ref name=boettjer>{{Cite news | last=Boettjer | first=John W. | title=No Proof Of Klan Membership | newspaper= The Washington Post | url-access=subscription | via=[[HighBeam Research]] | accessdate=November 27, 2015 | date=March 24, 1993 |url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-938531.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160220221131/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-938531.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 20, 2016 }}</ref> The weekly protests by LaRouche supporters continued into 1993.
