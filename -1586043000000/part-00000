A new high school student named Tanukichi Okuma enters the country's leading elite \"public morals school\" to reunite with his crush and student council president, Anna Nishikinomiya. However, Tanukichi quickly finds himself entwined with the perverted terrorist \"Blue Snow\" (\"Tundra's Blue\" in some translations) when she kidnaps and forces him to join her organization, \"SOX\", in creating and spreading pornographic material across the city as a form of protest against the regulations.\n\n==Characters==\n\n;{{nihongo|Tanukichi Okuma|\u5965\u9593 \u72f8\u5409|Okuma Tanukichi}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Y\u016bsuke Kobayashi (voice actor)|Y\u016bsuke Kobayashi]]<ref name=\"Japanese cast 1\">{{cite web|first=Lynzee|last=Loveridge|title=Shizuka Ishigami, Y\u016bsuke Kobayashi Star in Shimoneta to Iu Gainen ga Sonzai Shinai Taikutsu na Sekai TV Anime|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-02-17/shizuka-ishigami-yusuke-kobayashi-star-in-shimoneta-to-iu-gainen-ga-sonzai-shinai-taikutsu-na-sekai-tv-anime/.85108|website=Anime News Network|date=February 17, 2015|accessdate=December 22, 2019}}</ref>|[[Josh Grelle]]<ref name=\"ENVoiceCast\">{{cite web|first=Crystalyn|last=Hodgkins|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-08-12/funimation-reveals-dub-casts-for-overlord-shimoneta-1st-live-action-rurouni-kenshin-film-6th-hetalia-season/.105328 |title=Funimation Reveals Dub Casts For Overlord, Shimoneta, 1st Live-Action Rurouni Kenshin Film, 6th Hetalia Season |website=Anime News Network |date=August 12, 2016 |accessdate=August 17, 2016}}</ref>}}\n:The protagonist of the story, Anna's childhood friend, and the son of an infamous dirty-joke terrorist named Zenjuro who was arrested by moral authorities years ago after trying to spread condoms around the [[National Diet Building|Diet]] building in defiance of the moral laws. Tanukichi graduated from a public intermediate school with the \"lowest morals score\" according to his classmates. He finds himself constantly torn between keeping the secret of Ayame's [[alter-ego]] as a lewd terrorist and turning her in to the authorities to win Anna's favour. He is understood to have a knowledge of all things considered sexual and/or vulgar, obtained from and encouraged by his father during childhood. It is also implied that due to his upbringing, he finds the lewd activities to be quite stimulating to some extent, though he denies it.\n\n;{{nihongo|Ayame Kajou|\u83ef\u57ce \u7dbe\u5973|Kaj\u014d Ayame|extra2= / }} {{nihongo|Blue Snow|\u96ea\u539f\u306e\u9752|Setsugen no Ao|lit. \"Blue of the Snowfield\"}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Shizuka Ishigami]]<ref name=\"Japanese cast 1\"/>|[[Jamie Marchi]]<ref name=\"ENVoiceCast\"/>}}\n:The vice-president of the student council and daughter of a disgraced former Diet member who unsuccessfully fought against the public morality laws. Ayame secretly acts outside of school as the perverted terrorist \"Blue Snow,\" wearing panties over her face, spreading semi-pornographic leaflets, and shouting dirty jokes in defiance of the Japanese moral authorities. After kidnapping Tanukichi, she decides to form the group SOX with him and expand her activities to include the school and beyond. Her father taught her a code she can use on her mobile phone that disables the collars and PMs she wears for 3 minutes per day allowing her to freely say or do any lewd things during the time. Later on, it is shown that she might have developed romantic feelings for Tanukichi as she starts to act shy when the two of them are alone.\n\n;{{nihongo|Anna Nishikinomiya|\u30a2\u30f3\u30ca\u30fb\u9326\u30ce\u5bae|Anna Nishikinomiya<!-- not \"Nishikinomiya Anna\" -->}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Miyu Matsuki]]<ref name=\"Japanese cast 1\"/>|[[Monica Rial]]<ref name=\"ENVoiceCast\"/>}}\n:Student council president and Tanukichi's childhood crush who has tasked him with hunting down \"Blue Snow\" before she can endanger the morals of the school. After being accidentally kissed by Tanukichi, she develops an obsessive yandere-like love for him. However, due to lack of knowledge on \"immoral\" subjects, she ends up expressing her love in extreme tendencies. These include pursuing him relentlessly and attempting to rape him, endangering Kosuri and Ayame when she sees them with Tanukichi, making Tanukichi eat her \"[[Vaginal discharge|love nectar]]\" while simultaneously trying to obtain his, and becoming far more harsh and strict on her surveillance, believing that by doing \"justice\" and \"good things\" she will be loved by him. She exhibits extreme amounts of superhuman strength, speed and dexterity, especially when angered or motivated.\n\n;{{nihongo|Otome Saotome|\u65e9\u4e59\u5973 \u4e59\u5973|Saotome Otome}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Satomi Arai]]<ref name=\"Japanese cast 1\"/>|[[Brittney Karbowski]]<ref name=\"ENVoiceCast\"/>}}\n:An artistic prodigy whose paintings have won awards and are even displayed throughout the school, though she seems bored by the attention. After inadvertently discovering Tanukichi changing out of a Blue Snow costume, she blackmails him into being her \"pet\" for a while, and later joins SOX in order to learn how to draw explicit artwork after being educated on the subject by Ayame. Because her PM is able to detect any lewd movement her hands make, she instead taught herself to draw by holding tools with her mouth to avoid its sensor. She had an unrequited crush on Anna which later disappears after she joins SOX, although she didn't really \"like\" Anna in the first place she just mistakenly confused admiration with infatuation.\n\n;{{nihongo|Kosuri Onigashira|\u9b3c\u982d \u9f13\u4fee\u7406|Onigashira Kosuri}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Yui Horie]]<ref name=\"Japanese cast 2\">{{cite web|first=Egan|last=Loo|title= Shimoneta to Iu Gainen ga Sonzai Shinai Taikutsu na Sekai Adds More Cast|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-03-16/shimoneta-to-iu-gainen-ga-sonzai-shinai-taikutsu-na-sekai-adds-more-cast/.86024|website=Anime News Network|date=March 16, 2015|accessdate=December 22, 2019}}</ref>|Lara Woodhull<ref name=\"ENVoiceCast\"/>}}\n:The daughter of Keisuke and a fangirl of SOX who carries multiple weapons (such as [[air guns]] and [[Taser|electric stuns]]) with her and uses tactics she learned from romantic and shoujo manga to manipulate people, even her allies. Ayame lets her join in partly because her hairstyle looks similar to the tip of a penis. At first, she became upset that SOX was not being aggressive enough with their tactics and momentarily defected to Takuma's organization under the presumption that he was more dramatic with his approach against the Japanese authorities. She went back to SOX after finding out it was nothing more than an elaborate cover for him to pursue his fetish. She is currently pretending to be Tanukichi's sister while hiding out at his apartment.\n\n;{{nihongo|Hyouka Fuwa|\u4e0d\u7834 \u6c37\u83d3|Fuwa Hy\u014dka}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Saori Got\u014d]]<ref name=\"Japanese cast 1\"/>|Mikaela Krantz<ref name=\"ENVoiceCast\"/>}}\n:A budding scientist and classmate of Tanukichi who is obsessed with solving the mystery behind how babies are truly conceived, as the Japanese moral authorities have censored everything pertaining to [[sex education]] beyond vague generalities. She even went so far as to constantly visit [[gynecology]] clinics and hospitals in order to learn more until she was banned from visiting them. Often collects insects to study their reproductive habits. She has a very sharp sense of observation, able to deduce Kosuri's manipulative tactics, tell a fake gun from a real one, and convincing Oboro that her [[yaoi]] comics have an educational value through Oboro's restrictive mannerisms. She believes Tanukichi may hold the answers to her questions due to his knowledge of sexual terms and pesters him constantly to reveal what he knows about pregnancy to her. Though not officially a member of SOX, she helps them out from time to time because she is aware (to some degree) of the identities of its members.\n\n;{{nihongo|Raiki Gouriki|\u8f5f\u529b \u96f7\u6a39|G\u014driki Raiki}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Kenta Miyake]]<ref name=\"Japanese cast 2\"/>|[[David Wald]]<ref name=\"ENVoiceCast\"/>}}\n:Treasurer of the student council with a posture and demeanor similar to that of a gorilla, though he hates bananas.

Oboro even has this codified under \"Five Provisions,\" which includes the caveat that Oboro cannot interfere if Anna herself exhibits lewd behavior or desires. Surprisingly quick to change position on what is considered \"illegal\" material when a student protests strongly enough. Tanukichi later discovers that Oboro is biologically male, though Oboro insists that their gender is whatever the assignment requires.\n\n;{{nihongo|Keisuke Onigashira|\u9b3c\u982d \u6176\u4ecb|Onigashira Keisuke}}\n:Father of Kosuri; ero-terrorist who made deals with the moral authorities, angering the other terrorist groups around Japan, as well as his own daughter.\n\n;{{nihongo|Takuma Ichinose|\u4e00\u30ce\u702c \u7422\u78e8|Ichinose Takuma|extra2= / }} {{nihongo|White Peak|\u9802\u306e\u767d|Itadaki no Shiro|lit. \"White of the Top\"}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Ken Narita]]<ref name=\"Full Cast\"/>|[[Anthony Bowling]]<ref name=\"ENVoiceCast\"/>}}\n:Ero-terrorist who wraps himself in panties and is obsessed with underwear, having his own concepts of what is considered the best type of underwear. A \"high-class pervert\" who leads the group \"Gathered Fabric\" to steal all kinds of undergarments across Japan, he ends up clashing against SOX because Ayame believes him to be ruining the group's reputation by performing terrorist acts such as [[Carjacking|hijacking]] public transportation under the claim that Gathered Fabric is an ally of SOX. Ayame eventually confronts him, saying that she only wants to protest against the anti-profanity laws, not actively target the Japanese authorities.\n\n;{{nihongo|Base Black|\u624b\u306e\u9ed2|Tehen no Kuro|lit. \"Black Hand\"}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Sho Hayami]]<ref name=\"Full Cast\"/>|[[Christopher R.

He personally knew and worked alongside Zenjuro and planned to unlock a secret vault filled with erotic treasures using an artefact that was passed down to Tanukichi. He gathered the main cast to a resort via false invitations and challenged them to a duel for the artefact through Yakyuken. He noted on his satisfaction on how Tanukichi had grown up like his father before him when he departed.\n\n;{{nihongo|Binkan|\u3073\u3093\u304b\u3093\u3061\u3083\u3093|}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Yui Ogura]]<ref name=\"Japanese cast 2\"/>}}\n:An anime original character. Binkan is just an innocent bystander who is often nearby whenever SOX performs another act of ero-terrorism, staring at their latest handiwork.

Later at school, Tanukichi's troubles continue as a classmate demands he answer how babies are made, and then the Student Council brings him in to ask that he hunt down Blue Snow before her influence spreads to the school. Later that day, he heads to a quiet cafe with vice-president Ayame, who then ties him to a chair and reveals that she is actually Blue Snow. After being threatened into joining her crusade, Tanukichi helps her execute a plan at school during a student assembly, first spreading more perverted leaflets around the packed gym and then tricking the teachers into running outside while Ayame plays a video of two flies mating while she adds her own sound effects. Meanwhile, Tanukichi disguises himself as Blue Snow and starts drawing a giant asterisk sign on the track with a line painting machine.

Anna even hangs one such picture in the Student Council room, unaware of the double-meaning behind it until Tanukichi points it out. Tanukichi crushes on Anna again, but Ayame quietly warns him not to pursue her, as she can be frightening when angry, and that Anna's parents were responsible for the current and potential-future morals laws that have a stranglehold on Japan. Later, Ayame decides to hatch another plot at school during physical exams for the freshmen students. Ayame distracts Anna and Gouriki while Tanukichi disguises himself as Blue Snow and attempts to teach some students dirty words by sight. However, Anna catches the disguised Tanukichi before he can finish and chases him around the school, cornering him until Ayame appears as the real Blue Snow with the captured urine samples of the freshmen boys. As Anna and Gouriki race after her, Tanukichi takes off his Blue Snow disguise, unaware that an artistic student spotted him from a nearby roof.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 3\n| Title           = How to Love Someone\n| AltTitle        = Hito no aishi-kata\n| RAltTitle       = &nbsp;({{Nihongo2|\u4eba\u306e\u611b\u3057\u65b9}})\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|7|18}}\n| ShortSummary    = During an award ceremony for Otome Saotome's work, Otome dramatically rips up her certificate on stage and claims she is in a slump.

Meanwhile, Anna finds herself dealing with a mysterious stalker leaving threatening messages in her school locker and mailbox. After taking Otome out to dinner, Tanukichi finds out that she is in love with Anna like him after she reveals her name. However, when she threatens to turn him in, Tanukichi claims to be in love with Ayame instead. The next day, Ayame thinks that Otome could be the stalker after Tanukichi tells her about the situation, but Tanukichi thinks it's someone else entirely. At the student council meeting, Ayame schemes to draw the stalker out of hiding by posing as Anna's boyfriend, while Otome decides to watch Anna with Tanukichi by disguising the two of them. As the plan is launched at a public park, Otome reveals how Anna is her sole reason for painting, as she couldn't imagine anyone else after meeting her. Suddenly, multiple stalkers appear and attack the disguised Ayame. Tanukichi leaps out of cover and defends the girls, but one of the thugs manages to briefly knock him out as he inadvertently kisses Anna. Tanukichi tries to excuse himself but falls unconscious as Anna tries to deal with new, unresolved feelings from the kiss.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 4\n| Title           = The Saying Goes...

Tanukichi soon returns to school, but Ayame is strangely absent and Anna keeps avoiding him. Later, Ayame talks about her latest plan to reclaim a hidden stash of old pornographic material located on private property in Yotsuga Forest. She can't do it alone, so instead she plans to lure the students from school out to the forest during the weekend. However, her plans are sidelined when Tanukichi is targeted by a stalker and Anna's mother, Sophia, shows up to the school in person to get the students to support her new legislation that would force all students to wear chastity belt-like devices. Running low on options, Ayame decides to have Tanukichi confront his stalker while Otome hides in a closet to draw lewd pictures herself. However, the stalker turns out to be Anna who restrains and attempts to rape Tanukichi while being unable to understand her feelings. After Ayame accidentally interrupts them, Anna flees as Otome begins furiously drawing the scene with her teeth. Later that night, Hyouka confronts Anna in the lobby of her apartment, asking why her science lab was sterilized without asking. Anna responds that it was done out of love, as the more \"impure\" influences she eliminates, the more she will be rewarded with love, therefore everything she does for love is just.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 5\n| Title           = For Whom the Dirty Terrorism Benefits?\n| AltTitle        = Shimoneta tero wa ta ga tame ni?\n| RAltTitle       = &nbsp;({{Nihongo2|\u4e0b\u30cd\u30bf\u30c6\u30ed\u306f\u8ab0\u304c\u70ba\u306b\uff1f}})\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|8|1}}\n| ShortSummary    = Ayame tasks Tanukichi with distributing Otome's new pornographic artwork to the students along with a map to Yotsuga Forest.

While escaping from Anna, he accidentally drops his bag filled with illegal material in Hyouka's lab and tells Ayame that he can't distribute them with Anna constantly trying to pin him down. On Sunday, the day of the \"X Prohibition Law\" signature drive, Sophia plans to greet the students of her daughter's academy in person and Ayame plans to quixotically storm the forest against a large force of morality police. Surprisingly, the students all show up at the forest, as Hyouka picked up Tanukichi's material and quietly spread copies around school herself. She manages to distract the police long enough for the female students and SOX to start looking for the hidden stash of porn. However, Anna shows up in person, chasing down Ayame in her Blue Snow disguise. Ayame tosses Tanukichi down into the forest to help him escape from Anna, where he finds the porn stash in a suggestively-shaped cave. However, when he hears Ayame being strangled by Anna, he decides to save her wearing a new disguise he found in the cave. Anna can't understand why the new terrorist gives her similar feelings to Tanukichi, and leaps into the forest in shame. Later that night, Sophia holds a press conference announcing the success of the petition drive, but discovers too late that someone replaced her signed petitions with pornographic artwork, which gets broadcast live around the country and embarrasses her push for the new law.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 6\n| Title           = Handmade Warmth!\n| AltTitle        = Tezukuri no nuku mori!\n| RAltTitle       = &nbsp;({{Nihongo2|\u624b\u4f5c\u308a\u306e\u306c\u304f\u3082\u308a\uff01}})\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|8|8}}\n| ShortSummary    = As Otome's hentai drawings spread around the school, Ayame decides to take the next step and make masturbation aids in the kitchen of the cafe SOX regularly gathers at.

While they argue, Anna stops by and starts growing jealous, so Tanukichi quickly hands her a finished vibrating egg without telling her its true purpose to calm her down. The next day, Tanukichi accidentally activates the vibrator with the wireless remote Hyouka gave him, reawakening Anna's lust. Tanukichi tries desperately to escape or find a way to turn off the vibrator, but none of his friends want to help him, and Anna finally traps him inside the Student Council room after Gouriki finds and brings him to her. Tanukichi discovers that Anna turned the vibrator into a pendant, but is unable to reach it while being pinned down under her.

Shortly after that, Tanukichi reunites with Ayame only to find her speaking with Hyouka, and confiscates her [[yaoi]] book with characters loosely based off himself and Gouriki on the cover. Soon, Gouriki manages to round up multiple underwear thieves around school, when a mysterious terrorist calling himself \"White Peak\" of the group \"Gathered Fabric\" broadcasts his message across school. Back at the cafe, Ayame declares that SOX must take down White Top before his actions undercut the message of SOX. Later that same night, Tanukichi helps a little girl escape the moral police with the help of Hyouka in exchange for turning a blind eye to her yaoi books. The girl then tries to attack Tanukichi until he reveals that he's a member of SOX. The girl reveals herself to be Kosuri Onigashira, and she desperately wishes to join SOX. Ayame is reluctant to trust her, as Kosuri is daughter of Keisuke, another ero-terrorist who made deals with the moral authorities.

He quickly decides to pretend Kosuri is his little sister, but it backfires as Anna threatens to stab her, cutting a large hole in his floor before leaving. Later at school, Anna's father has sent Oboro Tsukimigusa to become the school's Prefect and take charge of the effort to eliminate impure influences in school. However, unlike the moral authorities, Oboro starts by removing mundane items like basketball hoops and volleyball nets as they may somehow lead boys to immoral thoughts. She also tries to confiscate Hyouka's yaoi manga until Hyouka convinces her that it has useful value. Meanwhile, Ayame plans to have SOX distribute Otome's drawings at other schools. Kosuri decides to take charge of the operation herself while Tanukichi convinces Oboro to white-list toilet paper rolls before Anna has an accident. Later, Kosuri returns to report her mission was completely successful, and fueled by her new success, treats Tanukichi like a slave at home. She explains to Tanukichi that she subverted the other school's student council by using her knowledge of shoujo and romantic manga tropes to play the boys and girls off of each other until they all fell under her control. While Tanukichi detests her methods, he can't bring himself to sell Kosuri out to Ayame. The next day, Ayame privately tells Tanukichi that SOX's actions suffered blowback with the sudden appearance of Oboro and her comrades. On top of dealing with the threats of the moral authorities and the Gathered Fabric faction, SOX must also find a way to sabotage the Prefect system before the government exports it to other schools.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 9\n| Title           = Do Androids Dream of Electric Masseurs?\n| AltTitle        = Andoroido wa denki anma no yume o miru ka\n| RAltTitle       = &nbsp;({{Nihongo2|\u30a2\u30f3\u30c9\u30ed\u30a4\u30c9\u306f\u96fb\u6c17\u30a2\u30f3\u30de\u306e\u5922\u3092\u898b\u308b\u304b}})\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|8|29}}\n| ShortSummary    = Ayame launches an operation at school to try and sabotage both the school Prefect program and Gathered Fabric at the same time. First, she uses her Blue Snow persona to spread more lewd drawing materials throughout school while Tanukichi will hang his used boxers to try and attract Gathered Fabric, then take out the underpants thieves to show that SOX does not support them. However, Anna and Oboro come through the door instead, the former of which being drawn to the room by the \"scent\" of Okuma's underwear. Anna again assaults Tanukichi, and he begs for help from Oboro but she offers none, claiming that even though the act may be immoral, she was trained not to interfere if Anna herself acts immorally. Meanwhile, Kosuri gets jealous that she is left out of the action while Otome uses the time to draw more yaoi artwork. Ayame launches the same plan again, as Tanukichi lies in wait for Gathered Fabric to appear. As Tanukichi manages to knock out several Gathered Fabric members, Kosuri meets with Hyouka to help herself, but Hyouka is not swayed by her usual charm. Elsewhere, Tanukichi subdues another panty thief and immediately steps on the crotch of a second person who stumbled into the same room. However, he discovers that person is Oboro, and that she actually has a penis. Oboro explains that she has been trained to serve Anna and her father for years, to the point that her likes, dislikes, even her gender are conditioned to whatever Anna's family wants them to be. Suddenly, the fire alarm is pulled and the school evacuates. Back at SOX's hideout, Kosuri takes responsibility for the act, but Ayame scolds her for sabotaging the plan with her own stubbornness. As SOX tries to think of their next move, they receive a message written on a pair of panties to meet at a nearby park, where White Peak himself appears.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 10\n| Title           = Masturbation Quest\n| AltTitle        = J\u012b-ky\u016b kuesuto\n| RAltTitle       = &nbsp;({{Nihongo2|\u30b8\u30a4\u7d1a\u30af\u30a8\u30b9\u30c8}})\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|9|5}}\n| ShortSummary    = As SOX makes negotiations with White Peak to stop hunting down Gathered Fabric members, Their negotiations fall through as Ayame chastises him for using erotic terrorism as a front for the panty thefts. The next morning as Tanukichi rushes to school on a bus due to the broken monorail, Gouriki tells him that somebody cut the monorail's power lines, to which he suspects the antics of Gathered Fabric. While talking to Ayame however, Tanukichi and Gouriki's bus becomes hijacked by a Gathered Fabric member. Among the jacked buses, Hyouka, Anna and Oboro, and Otome are in separate buses, with White Peak holding Otome's bus hostage. During his bus jacking, White Peak also hijacks the PM systems and proclaims war and his organization as an affiliate with SOX. As Hyouka is interrupted watching the news, she questions the Gathered Fabric member about panties, to which she is threatened by a gun, in which she identifies is a fake. As a result, the jacker is quickly subdued by the bus passengers, and Hyouka receives praise for her actions, although quickly dismissing their words. Meanwhile in Anna and Oboro's bus, as their jacker is collecting everybody's undergarments, Anna single-handedly beats him down, prompting fearful reactions from the male passengers (except for Oboro). On Tanukichi and Gouriki's bus, as Gouriki is about to give up his undergarments, he causes everybody to vomit in the bus, including the jacker and even the driver who saw him in women's underwear. As Tanukichi escapes, Ayame finds a leak in White Peak's true identity: Takuma Ichinose. She also finds out that there is a real gun among the fakes, to which Hyouka is monitoring. To apprehend Takuma, Ayame has Kosuri gather white panties and lure out Takuma's bus. Despite Tanukichi using musk panties to mask and protect himself, He is overpowered by Takuma, who becomes empowered (and turned on) by the scent. After Ayame intervenes, he is thrown off by Ayame's own scent infused in her panty mask, which allows Tanukichi to restrain him. Before SOX successfully captures him however, Ayame gets kicked out of the bus by Kosuri, prompting the Decency Squad to chase after her. Kosuri reveals she had switched places with the hostage, and joins Gathered Fabric for the sake of war, to which she points a stun gun at Tanukichi.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 11\n| Title           = Techno Break\n| AltTitle        = Tekuno bureiku\n| RAltTitle       = &nbsp;({{Nihongo2|\u30c6\u30af\u30ce\u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30af}})\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|9|12}}\n| ShortSummary    = As Kosuri points her stun gun at Tanukichi, he has no choice but to flee the bus, and he is chased further by the Decency Squad. After Kosuri helps out Takuma, they proceed to take the hostages to Zoshigaoka Academy. After managing to evade the Decency Squad, Tanukichi is approached by Hyouka, who shows him a breaking news story where 39 buses holding 500 hostages are being taken to Zoshigaoka Academy. At the school, the members of Gathered Fabric are making ransom demands with food and drinks as well as new panties, at the cost of provocative images of the students wearing panties on their heads if they fail to comply. As the students put on fresh pairs of panties to mark with their scent, Otome becomes excited at the sight and starts drawing with her mouth, to which she drops her pencil and stumbles across a box of paint. Meanwhile, Ayame and Tanukichi assess the dire situation at hand, to which SOX's blame in this incident will have society see them as criminals, and that the only way to clear SOX's name is to have them capture White Peak, lacking the numbers to do so. As Tanukichi is awkwardly approached again by Hyouka, she explains how people like Anna are brainwashed to believe that anything they do is \"righteous\" and fall into insanity. Reminded of Anna, Tanukichi devises a risky plan that if successful, can take down Takuma. While Kosuri devises tactics for Gathered Fabric, Takuma reveals that he had no intentions of a revolution or warfare or even wanting to escape. Betrayed, Kosuri tries to immobilize him with her stun gun, which fails due to the wine-stained underwear covering his body from the shock. Later, Otome calls Tanukichi, who manages to escape by drawing 3D perception art of her and the hostages, telling him Takuma's and the other hostages' location. As Tanukichi executes his plan, Takuma is about to receive his third set of panties, until Ayame, Tanukichi, and Anna step in, as well as Gouriki and Oboro. Tanukichi reveals that his plan was to get Anna to join forces with SOX, in exchange for his underwear, but has to keep scrubbing the scent off of him so that his cover would not be blown. As Otome helps the students escape using drawings of panties to distract Gathered Fabric members, Ayame and Anna finish off Takuma for good.

Tanukichi remembers an artifact passed down to him by his father to be used if he ever travels to Nukumi and decides to take it with him. When they arrive at the resort, they are met by Gouriki and Anna who reveal they were invited by Sophia as well. Anna jumps to the thought that her mother reserved the entire resort so that Anna can spend time with Tanukichi, but they all decide to spend time in the baths to wait for Sophia's return. Anna sends Gouriki off to fetch something and sexually assaults Tanukichi, but everyone was interrupted by a woman's scream. Everyone finds Sophia's unconscious body in the lockers, where they are confronted by an ero-terrorist called Base Black. Base Black reveals himself to be the one who gathered everyone to the resort and sends them on a brief chase which ends in him retrieving Tanukichi's artifact. Ayame and Tanukichi find him when attempting to fetch their bags for their clothes, which were replaced by black undergarments. He tells that he personally knew Zenjuro and plans to unlock a secret place filled with erotic treasures using the artifact. The others catch up to the scene and Base Black challenges them to a duel for the artifact through [[Yakyuken]]. Gouriki's loss and subsequent undressing stuns Base Black long enough for Tanukichi to retrieve the artifact, and alongside Ayame are tasked with hiding it deep in the woods while the rest hold off Base Black. They decide to find the treasure instead, but are unable to find an old cable tram to travel up the mountainous area. Hyouka finds them while collecting bugs and helps them locate and power the tram. As Tanukichi and Ayame are riding the tram, Anna appears while climbing the cables to catch up to Tanukichi and causes the floor of the tram to collapse with her falling through. The duo reach an old mansion and explore it, finding a mechanism that the artifact fits through as a wrench. Kosuri and Otome catch up to them and help open the vault containing the treasure - a large number of erotic sculptures and statues. After resealing the vault, the four find Base Black observing them from above, satisfied on how Tanukichi had grown up. The four reunite with Gouriki and Anna while Oboro destroys the cable tram. They pledge that one day the treasure will be able to see the world again when the anti-profanity enforcement comes to an end.\n}}\n|}\n\n==Notes==\n<references group=\"n\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.shimoseka.com Anime official website] {{in lang|ja}}\n*[http://comic.mag-garden.co.jp/812/934.html ''Shimoneta to Iu Gainen ga Sonzai Shinai Taikutsu na Sekai: Man**-hen''] at [[Mag Garden]] Comic Online {{in lang|ja}}\n*{{ann|anime|16731}}\n\n{{J.C.Staff}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Shimoneta}}\n[[Category:2012 Japanese novels]]\n[[Category:Anime and manga based on light novels]]\n[[Category:Comedy anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Dystopian anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Funimation]]\n[[Category:Gagaga Bunko]]\n[[Category:Shogakukan franchises]]\n[[Category:J.C.Staff]]\n[[Category:Light novels]]\n[[Category:Mag Garden manga]]\n[[Category:Sex comedy anime and manga]]\n[[Category:School life in anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Sh\u014dnen manga]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|the [[owarai]] term|Glossary of owarai terms#shimoneta}}\n{{Infobox animanga/Header\n| name            = Shimoneta: A Boring World Where the Concept of Dirty Jokes Doesn't Exist\n| image           = Shimoneta to Iu Gainen ga Sonzai Shinai Taikutsu na Sekai light novel volume 1 cover.jpg\n| caption         = First light novel volume cover featuring Ayame Kajou.\n| ja_kanji        = \u4e0b\u30cd\u30bf\u3068\u3044\u3046\u6982\u5ff5\u304c\u5b58\u5728\u3057\u306a\u3044\u9000\u5c48\u306a\u4e16\u754c\n| ja_romaji       = Shimoneta to Iu Gainen ga Sonzai Shinai Taikutsu na Sekai\n| genre           = [[Dystopian]],<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dempsey |first1=Joe |title=The Sex-Obsessed Cyberpunk Dystopia of Shimoneta |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2015-10-28/the-sex-obsessed-cyberpunk-dystopia-of-shimoneta/.94709 |website=Anime News Network |accessdate=November 5, 2018 |date=October 28, 2015}}</ref> [[Comedy|school comedy]],<ref>{{cite web |last1=Loo |first1=Egan |title=Shimoneta to Iu Gainen ga Sonzai Shinai Taikutsu na Sekai School Comedy Novels Get Anime |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2014-10-16/shimoneta-to-iu-gainen-ga-sonzai-shinai-taikutsu-na-sekai-school-comedy-novels-get-anime/.80009 |website=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=November 5, 2018 |date=October 16, 2014}}</ref> [[sex comedy]]<ref>{{cite web |last1=Osmond |first1=Andrew |title=Evangelion 1.11 and Shimoneta Released Monday |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2017-04-23/evangelion-1.11-and-shimoneta-released-monday/.115184 |website=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=January 3, 2020 |date=April 23, 2017}}</ref><!-- Genres should be based on what reliable sources list them as and not on personal interpretations.

Though not officially a member of SOX, she helps them out from time to time because she is aware (to some degree) of the identities of its members.\n\n;{{nihongo|Raiki Gouriki|\u8f5f\u529b \u96f7\u6a39|G\u014driki Raiki}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Kenta Miyake]]<ref name=\"Japanese cast 2\"/>|[[David Wald]]<ref name=\"ENVoiceCast\"/>}}\n:Treasurer of the student council with a posture and demeanor similar to that of a gorilla, though he hates bananas.

After trying to defuse a tense situation, he finds himself about to be arrested by the moral police when the infamous perverted terrorist Blue Snow appears, spreading lewd leaflets around the train station and threatening to strip naked while Tanukichi escapes in the confusion. Later at school, Tanukichi's troubles continue as a classmate demands he answer how babies are made, and then the Student Council brings him in to ask that he hunt down Blue Snow before her influence spreads to the school. Later that day, he heads to a quiet cafe with vice-president Ayame, who then ties him to a chair and reveals that she is actually Blue Snow. After being threatened into joining her crusade, Tanukichi helps her execute a plan at school during a student assembly, first spreading more perverted leaflets around the packed gym and then tricking the teachers into running outside while Ayame plays a video of two flies mating while she adds her own sound effects. Meanwhile, Tanukichi disguises himself as Blue Snow and starts drawing a giant asterisk sign on the track with a line painting machine. The entire school, including Tanukichi, finds themselves having trouble dealing with the weird new feelings brought on by this act.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 2\n| Title           = The Mysteries of Pregnancy\n| AltTitle        = Ninshin no nazo\n| RAltTitle       = &nbsp;({{Nihongo2|\u598a\u5a20\u306e\u306a\u305e}})\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|7|11}}\n| ShortSummary    = While the school is recovering from Blue Snow's latest activity, Tanukichi recalls his own past and his connection to Anna, gaining the trust of the Student Council. Ayame then tasks him with copying and spreading increasingly-rare paper inserts with suggestive pornographic material across the school. Anna even hangs one such picture in the Student Council room, unaware of the double-meaning behind it until Tanukichi points it out. Tanukichi crushes on Anna again, but Ayame quietly warns him not to pursue her, as she can be frightening when angry, and that Anna's parents were responsible for the current and potential-future morals laws that have a stranglehold on Japan. Later, Ayame decides to hatch another plot at school during physical exams for the freshmen students. Ayame distracts Anna and Gouriki while Tanukichi disguises himself as Blue Snow and attempts to teach some students dirty words by sight. However, Anna catches the disguised Tanukichi before he can finish and chases him around the school, cornering him until Ayame appears as the real Blue Snow with the captured urine samples of the freshmen boys. As Anna and Gouriki race after her, Tanukichi takes off his Blue Snow disguise, unaware that an artistic student spotted him from a nearby roof.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 3\n| Title           = How to Love Someone\n| AltTitle        = Hito no aishi-kata\n| RAltTitle       = &nbsp;({{Nihongo2|\u4eba\u306e\u611b\u3057\u65b9}})\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|7|18}}\n| ShortSummary    = During an award ceremony for Otome Saotome's work, Otome dramatically rips up her certificate on stage and claims she is in a slump. Later, Otome drags Tanukichi out of class and threatens to reveal his connection to Blue Snow unless he helps her resolve a romantic issue. Meanwhile, Anna finds herself dealing with a mysterious stalker leaving threatening messages in her school locker and mailbox. After taking Otome out to dinner, Tanukichi finds out that she is in love with Anna like him after she reveals her name. However, when she threatens to turn him in, Tanukichi claims to be in love with Ayame instead. The next day, Ayame thinks that Otome could be the stalker after Tanukichi tells her about the situation, but Tanukichi thinks it's someone else entirely. At the student council meeting, Ayame schemes to draw the stalker out of hiding by posing as Anna's boyfriend, while Otome decides to watch Anna with Tanukichi by disguising the two of them. As the plan is launched at a public park, Otome reveals how Anna is her sole reason for painting, as she couldn't imagine anyone else after meeting her. Suddenly, multiple stalkers appear and attack the disguised Ayame. Tanukichi leaps out of cover and defends the girls, but one of the thugs manages to briefly knock him out as he inadvertently kisses Anna. Tanukichi tries to excuse himself but falls unconscious as Anna tries to deal with new, unresolved feelings from the kiss.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 4\n| Title           = The Saying Goes...

Tanukichi soon returns to school, but Ayame is strangely absent and Anna keeps avoiding him. Later, Ayame talks about her latest plan to reclaim a hidden stash of old pornographic material located on private property in Yotsuga Forest. She can't do it alone, so instead she plans to lure the students from school out to the forest during the weekend. However, her plans are sidelined when Tanukichi is targeted by a stalker and Anna's mother, Sophia, shows up to the school in person to get the students to support her new legislation that would force all students to wear chastity belt-like devices. Running low on options, Ayame decides to have Tanukichi confront his stalker while Otome hides in a closet to draw lewd pictures herself. However, the stalker turns out to be Anna who restrains and attempts to rape Tanukichi while being unable to understand her feelings. After Ayame accidentally interrupts them, Anna flees as Otome begins furiously drawing the scene with her teeth. Later that night, Hyouka confronts Anna in the lobby of her apartment, asking why her science lab was sterilized without asking. Anna responds that it was done out of love, as the more \"impure\" influences she eliminates, the more she will be rewarded with love, therefore everything she does for love is just.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 5\n| Title           = For Whom the Dirty Terrorism Benefits?\n| AltTitle        = Shimoneta tero wa ta ga tame ni?\n| RAltTitle       = &nbsp;({{Nihongo2|\u4e0b\u30cd\u30bf\u30c6\u30ed\u306f\u8ab0\u304c\u70ba\u306b\uff1f}})\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|8|1}}\n| ShortSummary    = Ayame tasks Tanukichi with distributing Otome's new pornographic artwork to the students along with a map to Yotsuga Forest. However, Tanukichi finds himself targeted by an increasingly-obsessive Anna around school, trying to make him drink her \"love nectar,\" and drink from Tanukichi's. While escaping from Anna, he accidentally drops his bag filled with illegal material in Hyouka's lab and tells Ayame that he can't distribute them with Anna constantly trying to pin him down. On Sunday, the day of the \"X Prohibition Law\" signature drive, Sophia plans to greet the students of her daughter's academy in person and Ayame plans to quixotically storm the forest against a large force of morality police. Surprisingly, the students all show up at the forest, as Hyouka picked up Tanukichi's material and quietly spread copies around school herself. She manages to distract the police long enough for the female students and SOX to start looking for the hidden stash of porn. However, Anna shows up in person, chasing down Ayame in her Blue Snow disguise. Ayame tosses Tanukichi down into the forest to help him escape from Anna, where he finds the porn stash in a suggestively-shaped cave. However, when he hears Ayame being strangled by Anna, he decides to save her wearing a new disguise he found in the cave. Anna can't understand why the new terrorist gives her similar feelings to Tanukichi, and leaps into the forest in shame. Later that night, Sophia holds a press conference announcing the success of the petition drive, but discovers too late that someone replaced her signed petitions with pornographic artwork, which gets broadcast live around the country and embarrasses her push for the new law.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 6\n| Title           = Handmade Warmth!\n| AltTitle        = Tezukuri no nuku mori!\n| RAltTitle       = &nbsp;({{Nihongo2|\u624b\u4f5c\u308a\u306e\u306c\u304f\u3082\u308a\uff01}})\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|8|8}}\n| ShortSummary    = As Otome's hentai drawings spread around the school, Ayame decides to take the next step and make masturbation aids in the kitchen of the cafe SOX regularly gathers at. Tanukichi is assigned the task of getting Hyouka to develop small vibrators, but upon coming to collect one, a mostly-naked Hyouka attempts to learn about his \"cucumber\" as payment for her services. While they argue, Anna stops by and starts growing jealous, so Tanukichi quickly hands her a finished vibrating egg without telling her its true purpose to calm her down. The next day, Tanukichi accidentally activates the vibrator with the wireless remote Hyouka gave him, reawakening Anna's lust. Tanukichi tries desperately to escape or find a way to turn off the vibrator, but none of his friends want to help him, and Anna finally traps him inside the Student Council room after Gouriki finds and brings him to her. Tanukichi discovers that Anna turned the vibrator into a pendant, but is unable to reach it while being pinned down under her. Eventually, the vibrator shorts out as Anna climaxes and Tanukichi manages to escape. Later, Anna overhears Otome make a dirty remark about Tanukichi and starts strangling him while Ayame refuses to help.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 7\n| Title           = What SOX Created\n| AltTitle        = SOX ga tsukuri shi mono\n| RAltTitle       = &nbsp;({{Nihongo2|SOX\u304c\u4f5c\u308a\u3057\u8005}})\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|8|15}}\n| ShortSummary    = SOX forms alliances with other erotic terrorist groups throughout Japan to share various pornographic books with each other.

Tanukichi and Ayame watch a girls' changing room to catch a thief, but when Ayame runs off, Anna appears to sexually assault Tanukichi again. Shortly after that, Tanukichi reunites with Ayame only to find her speaking with Hyouka, and confiscates her [[yaoi]] book with characters loosely based off himself and Gouriki on the cover. Soon, Gouriki manages to round up multiple underwear thieves around school, when a mysterious terrorist calling himself \"White Peak\" of the group \"Gathered Fabric\" broadcasts his message across school. Back at the cafe, Ayame declares that SOX must take down White Top before his actions undercut the message of SOX. Later that same night, Tanukichi helps a little girl escape the moral police with the help of Hyouka in exchange for turning a blind eye to her yaoi books. The girl then tries to attack Tanukichi until he reveals that he's a member of SOX. The girl reveals herself to be Kosuri Onigashira, and she desperately wishes to join SOX. Ayame is reluctant to trust her, as Kosuri is daughter of Keisuke, another ero-terrorist who made deals with the moral authorities. However, she decides to let Kosuri become a member of SOX, in part because Kosuri's hairstyle reminds her of a penis head.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 8\n| Title           = The Devil Blows His Own Trumpet\n| AltTitle        = Akuma ga ki tari te hora o fuku\n| RAltTitle       = &nbsp;({{Nihongo2|\u60aa\u9b54\u304c\u6765\u305f\u308a\u3066\u30db\u30e9\u3092\u5439\u304f}})\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|8|22}}\n| ShortSummary    = Tanukichi wakes up to find Kosuri sleeping next to him and Anna (who had been standing there for hours) dangerously holding a knife in his doorway. He quickly decides to pretend Kosuri is his little sister, but it backfires as Anna threatens to stab her, cutting a large hole in his floor before leaving. Later at school, Anna's father has sent Oboro Tsukimigusa to become the school's Prefect and take charge of the effort to eliminate impure influences in school. However, unlike the moral authorities, Oboro starts by removing mundane items like basketball hoops and volleyball nets as they may somehow lead boys to immoral thoughts. She also tries to confiscate Hyouka's yaoi manga until Hyouka convinces her that it has useful value. Meanwhile, Ayame plans to have SOX distribute Otome's drawings at other schools. Kosuri decides to take charge of the operation herself while Tanukichi convinces Oboro to white-list toilet paper rolls before Anna has an accident. Later, Kosuri returns to report her mission was completely successful, and fueled by her new success, treats Tanukichi like a slave at home. She explains to Tanukichi that she subverted the other school's student council by using her knowledge of shoujo and romantic manga tropes to play the boys and girls off of each other until they all fell under her control. While Tanukichi detests her methods, he can't bring himself to sell Kosuri out to Ayame. The next day, Ayame privately tells Tanukichi that SOX's actions suffered blowback with the sudden appearance of Oboro and her comrades. On top of dealing with the threats of the moral authorities and the Gathered Fabric faction, SOX must also find a way to sabotage the Prefect system before the government exports it to other schools.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 9\n| Title           = Do Androids Dream of Electric Masseurs?\n| AltTitle        = Andoroido wa denki anma no yume o miru ka\n| RAltTitle       = &nbsp;({{Nihongo2|\u30a2\u30f3\u30c9\u30ed\u30a4\u30c9\u306f\u96fb\u6c17\u30a2\u30f3\u30de\u306e\u5922\u3092\u898b\u308b\u304b}})\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|8|29}}\n| ShortSummary    = Ayame launches an operation at school to try and sabotage both the school Prefect program and Gathered Fabric at the same time. First, she uses her Blue Snow persona to spread more lewd drawing materials throughout school while Tanukichi will hang his used boxers to try and attract Gathered Fabric, then take out the underpants thieves to show that SOX does not support them. However, Anna and Oboro come through the door instead, the former of which being drawn to the room by the \"scent\" of Okuma's underwear. Anna again assaults Tanukichi, and he begs for help from Oboro but she offers none, claiming that even though the act may be immoral, she was trained not to interfere if Anna herself acts immorally. Meanwhile, Kosuri gets jealous that she is left out of the action while Otome uses the time to draw more yaoi artwork. Ayame launches the same plan again, as Tanukichi lies in wait for Gathered Fabric to appear. As Tanukichi manages to knock out several Gathered Fabric members, Kosuri meets with Hyouka to help herself, but Hyouka is not swayed by her usual charm. Elsewhere, Tanukichi subdues another panty thief and immediately steps on the crotch of a second person who stumbled into the same room. However, he discovers that person is Oboro, and that she actually has a penis. Oboro explains that she has been trained to serve Anna and her father for years, to the point that her likes, dislikes, even her gender are conditioned to whatever Anna's family wants them to be. Suddenly, the fire alarm is pulled and the school evacuates. Back at SOX's hideout, Kosuri takes responsibility for the act, but Ayame scolds her for sabotaging the plan with her own stubbornness. As SOX tries to think of their next move, they receive a message written on a pair of panties to meet at a nearby park, where White Peak himself appears.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 10\n| Title           = Masturbation Quest\n| AltTitle        = J\u012b-ky\u016b kuesuto\n| RAltTitle       = &nbsp;({{Nihongo2|\u30b8\u30a4\u7d1a\u30af\u30a8\u30b9\u30c8}})\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|9|5}}\n| ShortSummary    = As SOX makes negotiations with White Peak to stop hunting down Gathered Fabric members, Their negotiations fall through as Ayame chastises him for using erotic terrorism as a front for the panty thefts. The next morning as Tanukichi rushes to school on a bus due to the broken monorail, Gouriki tells him that somebody cut the monorail's power lines, to which he suspects the antics of Gathered Fabric. While talking to Ayame however, Tanukichi and Gouriki's bus becomes hijacked by a Gathered Fabric member. Among the jacked buses, Hyouka, Anna and Oboro, and Otome are in separate buses, with White Peak holding Otome's bus hostage. During his bus jacking, White Peak also hijacks the PM systems and proclaims war and his organization as an affiliate with SOX. As Hyouka is interrupted watching the news, she questions the Gathered Fabric member about panties, to which she is threatened by a gun, in which she identifies is a fake. As a result, the jacker is quickly subdued by the bus passengers, and Hyouka receives praise for her actions, although quickly dismissing their words. Meanwhile in Anna and Oboro's bus, as their jacker is collecting everybody's undergarments, Anna single-handedly beats him down, prompting fearful reactions from the male passengers (except for Oboro). On Tanukichi and Gouriki's bus, as Gouriki is about to give up his undergarments, he causes everybody to vomit in the bus, including the jacker and even the driver who saw him in women's underwear. As Tanukichi escapes, Ayame finds a leak in White Peak's true identity: Takuma Ichinose. She also finds out that there is a real gun among the fakes, to which Hyouka is monitoring. To apprehend Takuma, Ayame has Kosuri gather white panties and lure out Takuma's bus. Despite Tanukichi using musk panties to mask and protect himself, He is overpowered by Takuma, who becomes empowered (and turned on) by the scent. After Ayame intervenes, he is thrown off by Ayame's own scent infused in her panty mask, which allows Tanukichi to restrain him. Before SOX successfully captures him however, Ayame gets kicked out of the bus by Kosuri, prompting the Decency Squad to chase after her. Kosuri reveals she had switched places with the hostage, and joins Gathered Fabric for the sake of war, to which she points a stun gun at Tanukichi.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 11\n| Title           = Techno Break\n| AltTitle        = Tekuno bureiku\n| RAltTitle       = &nbsp;({{Nihongo2|\u30c6\u30af\u30ce\u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30af}})\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|9|12}}\n| ShortSummary    = As Kosuri points her stun gun at Tanukichi, he has no choice but to flee the bus, and he is chased further by the Decency Squad. After Kosuri helps out Takuma, they proceed to take the hostages to Zoshigaoka Academy. After managing to evade the Decency Squad, Tanukichi is approached by Hyouka, who shows him a breaking news story where 39 buses holding 500 hostages are being taken to Zoshigaoka Academy. At the school, the members of Gathered Fabric are making ransom demands with food and drinks as well as new panties, at the cost of provocative images of the students wearing panties on their heads if they fail to comply. As the students put on fresh pairs of panties to mark with their scent, Otome becomes excited at the sight and starts drawing with her mouth, to which she drops her pencil and stumbles across a box of paint. Meanwhile, Ayame and Tanukichi assess the dire situation at hand, to which SOX's blame in this incident will have society see them as criminals, and that the only way to clear SOX's name is to have them capture White Peak, lacking the numbers to do so. As Tanukichi is awkwardly approached again by Hyouka, she explains how people like Anna are brainwashed to believe that anything they do is \"righteous\" and fall into insanity. Reminded of Anna, Tanukichi devises a risky plan that if successful, can take down Takuma. While Kosuri devises tactics for Gathered Fabric, Takuma reveals that he had no intentions of a revolution or warfare or even wanting to escape. Betrayed, Kosuri tries to immobilize him with her stun gun, which fails due to the wine-stained underwear covering his body from the shock. Later, Otome calls Tanukichi, who manages to escape by drawing 3D perception art of her and the hostages, telling him Takuma's and the other hostages' location. As Tanukichi executes his plan, Takuma is about to receive his third set of panties, until Ayame, Tanukichi, and Anna step in, as well as Gouriki and Oboro. Tanukichi reveals that his plan was to get Anna to join forces with SOX, in exchange for his underwear, but has to keep scrubbing the scent off of him so that his cover would not be blown. As Otome helps the students escape using drawings of panties to distract Gathered Fabric members, Ayame and Anna finish off Takuma for good. After Ayame's dirty joke speech to the public, Kosuri returns to SOX, now acknowledging Ayame as her master once more.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 12\n| Title           = Dirty Jokes Forever!\n| AltTitle        = Shimoneta yo eien ni\n| RAltTitle       = &nbsp;({{Nihongo2|\u4e0b\u30cd\u30bf\u3088\u6c38\u9060\u306b}})\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|9|19}}\n| ShortSummary    = The SOX members receive invitations to meet up at a hot springs resort called Health Land in Nukumi, presumably by Sophia Nishikinomiya herself. Tanukichi remembers an artifact passed down to him by his father to be used if he ever travels to Nukumi and decides to take it with him. When they arrive at the resort, they are met by Gouriki and Anna who reveal they were invited by Sophia as well. Anna jumps to the thought that her mother reserved the entire resort so that Anna can spend time with Tanukichi, but they all decide to spend time in the baths to wait for Sophia's return. Anna sends Gouriki off to fetch something and sexually assaults Tanukichi, but everyone was interrupted by a woman's scream. Everyone finds Sophia's unconscious body in the lockers, where they are confronted by an ero-terrorist called Base Black. Base Black reveals himself to be the one who gathered everyone to the resort and sends them on a brief chase which ends in him retrieving Tanukichi's artifact. Ayame and Tanukichi find him when attempting to fetch their bags for their clothes, which were replaced by black undergarments. He tells that he personally knew Zenjuro and plans to unlock a secret place filled with erotic treasures using the artifact. The others catch up to the scene and Base Black challenges them to a duel for the artifact through [[Yakyuken]]. Gouriki's loss and subsequent undressing stuns Base Black long enough for Tanukichi to retrieve the artifact, and alongside Ayame are tasked with hiding it deep in the woods while the rest hold off Base Black. They decide to find the treasure instead, but are unable to find an old cable tram to travel up the mountainous area. Hyouka finds them while collecting bugs and helps them locate and power the tram. As Tanukichi and Ayame are riding the tram, Anna appears while climbing the cables to catch up to Tanukichi and causes the floor of the tram to collapse with her falling through. The duo reach an old mansion and explore it, finding a mechanism that the artifact fits through as a wrench. Kosuri and Otome catch up to them and help open the vault containing the treasure - a large number of erotic sculptures and statues. After resealing the vault, the four find Base Black observing them from above, satisfied on how Tanukichi had grown up. The four reunite with Gouriki and Anna while Oboro destroys the cable tram. They pledge that one day the treasure will be able to see the world again when the anti-profanity enforcement comes to an end.\n}}\n|}\n\n==Notes==\n<references group=\"n\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.shimoseka.com Anime official website] {{in lang|ja}}\n*[http://comic.mag-garden.co.jp/812/934.html ''Shimoneta to Iu Gainen ga Sonzai Shinai Taikutsu na Sekai: Man**-hen''] at [[Mag Garden]] Comic Online {{in lang|ja}}\n*{{ann|anime|16731}}\n\n{{J.C.Staff}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Shimoneta}}\n[[Category:2012 Japanese novels]]\n[[Category:Anime and manga based on light novels]]\n[[Category:Comedy anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Dystopian anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Funimation]]\n[[Category:Gagaga Bunko]]\n[[Category:Shogakukan franchises]]\n[[Category:J.C.Staff]]\n[[Category:Light novels]]\n[[Category:Mag Garden manga]]\n[[Category:Sex comedy anime and manga]]\n[[Category:School life in anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Sh\u014dnen manga]]\n", "name_user": "Toweli", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimoneta"}

Several cities have existed on this site, which is significant for the interchange of culture and politics at a site of major strategic value.\n\nHuman settlements on the site of Merv existed from the 3rd millennium BC until the 18th century AD. It changed hands repeatedly throughout its history. Under the [[Achaemenid Empire]], it was the centre of the satrapy of [[Margiana]]. It was subsequently ruled by the [[Greeks]], [[Arabs]], [[Seljuk Turks|Turks]] and the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid Persians]]. During the 12th and 13th centuries it became one of the largest cities in the world, having a population of as many as 500,000. In 1221 the city opened its gates to an invading [[Mongol Empire |Mongol]] [[Orda (organization) | horde]]; the resulting destruction of the city proved devastating. Historical accounts contend that the entire population (including refugees) of a million people were killed. \n\nThough rebuilt after the Mongol destruction, the city never regained its full former prosperity. Between 1788 and 1789 the city was razed for the last time, and its population deported. By the 1800s the city was completely deserted.\n\n[[UNESCO]] has listed the site of ancient Merv as a [[World Heritage Site]].<ref>\nSee [[List of World Heritage Sites in Turkmenistan]].\n</ref>\n\n== History ==\nMerv has prehistoric roots: archaeological surveys have revealed many traces of village life as far back as the 3rd millennium BC and have associated the area culturally with the [[Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex]]. The geography of the [[Zend-Avesta]] (commentaries on the [[Avesta]]) mentions Merv (under the name of ''Mouru'') along with [[Balkh]]. In [[Zoroastrianism]], the god [[Ahura Mazda]] created Mouru as one of sixteen perfect lands.<ref>Vendidad, Faragard-1</ref>\n\nUnder the [[Achaemenid Empire]] (c. 550\u2013330 BC), the historical record mentions Merv as a place of some importance: under the name of ''Margu'' it occurs as part of one of the [[satrap]]ies in the [[Behistun inscriptions]] (''ca''. 515 BC) of the [[Persia]]n monarch [[Darius Hystaspis]]. The first city of Merv was founded in the 6th century BC as part of the [[Achaemenid]] expansion into the region<ref>\"Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Photography: Exploring the Medieval City of Merv, on the Silk Roads of Central Asia\" by Tim Williams in ''Archaeology International'', Issue 15 (2011\u20132012), pp. 74\u201388.</ref> of [[Cyrus the Great]] (559\u2013530 BC), but later strata deeply cover the Achaemenid levels at the site.\n\n=== Hellenistic era ===\n[[Alexander the Great]]'s visit to Merv is merely legendary, but the city was named Alexandria (\u1f08\u03bb\u03b5\u03be\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1) after him for a time. After Alexander's death in 323 BC, it became the capital of the [[Margu|Province of Margiana]] of the [[Seleucid]], [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom|Greco-Bactrian]] (256-125 BC), [[Parthia]]n, and [[Sassanid dynasty|Sassanid]] states. \nThe Seleucid ruler [[Antiochus Soter]] (reigned 281\u2013261 BC) renamed it to Antiochia Margiana; he rebuilt and expanded the city at the site presently known as [[Gyaur Gala]] (G\u00e4w\u00fcrgala) fortress. [[Isidore of Charax]] wrote that the Antiochia was called the \"unwatered\" (\u0386\u03bd\u03c5\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2).<ref>[https://topostext.org/work/583#14 Isidoros of Charax, Parthian Stations, 14]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.gr/books?id=EA1FAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&hl=el#v=onepage&q=\u0391\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03bf\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1&f=false Isidoros of Charax, Parthian Stations, p.254 - GR]</ref>\nAfter the fall of the Seleucid dynasty (63 BC), [[Bactria]],{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Parthia, and the [[Kushans]] took control in succession. In 53 BC some 10,000 Roman prisoners of war from the [[Battle of Carrhae]] appear to have been deported to Merv. \n\nMerv was a major city of [[Buddhist]] learning, with Buddhist monastery temples for many centuries until its Islamicization.<ref>{{cite web|author=Anur Tour Uzbekistan |url=http://www.tourstoturkmenistan.com/en/sights/merv-mary/ruins-in-merv.html |title=Merv, Ruins in Merv, Sights of Turkmenistan, Tours to Turkmenistan |website=Tourstoturkmenistan.com |date= |accessdate=2016-10-21}}</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20150402140215/http://www.medeniyet.gov.tm/index.php/en/culture-dialogue/119-gadymy-merwde-butparazlygy%C5%88-d%C3%B6re%C3%BD%C5%9Fi]</ref>  At the site of Gyaur Kala and [[Ba\u00fdramaly|Bairam Ali]] Buddhism was followed and practised often at the local Buddhist [[stupa]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asthabharati.org/Dia_July%20011/suni.htm |title=Ancient Merv- the Queen of the W |website=Asthabharati.org |date= |accessdate=2016-10-21}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Sassanid [[Ardashir I of Persia|Ardashir I]] (220\u2013240 AD) took Merv, the study of [[numismatics]] picks up the thread: the unbroken series of coins originally minted at Merv document a long unbroken direct Sassanian rule of almost four centuries. During this period Merv was home to practitioners of various religions beside the official Sassanid [[Zoroastrianism]], including Buddhists, [[Manichaeism|Manichaeans]], and Christians of the [[Church of the East]]. Between the 6th (553) and 11th centuries AD, Merv served as the seat of an [[Nestorianism|East Syrian]] [[Merv (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)|metropolitan province]], key in the Dualist church's mission east up the Silk Road to Turkestan and China. The [[Hephthalite]] occupation from the end of the 5th century to 565 AD briefly interrupted Sassanid rule.\n\n===Arab conquest and influence===\n{{Campaignbox Muslim Conquest Persia}}\n<!-- (this place was a little colder because it was in the mountains)  -->\n[[File:Marv (peutinger Map).png|thumb|left|The city of Marv, Turkmenistan in the 4th century as shown on the [[Peutinger Map]]]][[Sassanian]] rule came to an end when the last Sassanian ruler, [[Yazdegerd III]] (632\u2013651) was killed not far from the city and the Sassanian military governor surrendered to the approaching Arab army. Representatives of the caliph [[Umar]] occupied the city, which became the capital of the [[Umayyad]] province of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]. In 671 [[Ziyad ibn Abi Sufyan]] sent 50,000 Arab troops to Merv as a colony. This colony retained its native [[Kufa]]n sympathies and became the nucleus of Khurasan.<ref>Muir pp. 295\u20136</ref> Using the city as their base, the Arabs, led by [[Qutayba ibn Muslim]] from 705 to 715, brought under subjection large parts of Central Asia, including [[Balkh]], [[Bukhara|Bokhara]], and [[Fergana]]. Merv, and [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] in general, became one of the first parts of the [[Persian language|Persian]]-speaking world to become majority-[[Muslim]]. Arab immigration to the area was substantial. A Chinese captured at Talas, [[Du Huan]], was brought to [[Baghdad]] and toured the caliphate. He observed that in Merv, [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasan]], Arabs and Persians lived in mixed concentrations.<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/?id=qkIsAQAAIAAJ&q=Dashi+(Land+of+the+Arabs)+From+Tong+Dian+chapter+193,+appended+to+section+on+the+Dashi+(Arabs)+(TD:+1044):+%5BThe+city+of+the%5D+Arabs&dq=Dashi+(Land+of+the+Arabs)+From+Tong+Dian+chapter+193,+appended+to+section+on+the+Dashi+(Arabs)+(TD:+1044):+%5BThe+city+of+the%5D+Arabs|title= Harvard Middle Eastern and Islamic review, Volumes 5\u20137|author= Harvard University.

After the Abbasids became established in [[Baghdad]], Abu Muslim continued to rule Merv as a semi-independent prince until his eventual assassination. Indeed, Merv operated as the center of [[Abbasid]] partisanship for the duration of the [[Abbasid Revolution]] of 746-750, and later on became a consistent source of political support for the Abbasid rulers in [[Baghdad]]; the governorship of Khurasan at Merv was considered{{by whom|date=July 2016}} one of the most important political figures of the [[Caliphate]]. The influential [[Barmakid]] family, based in Merv, played an important part in transferring Greek knowledge (established in Merv since the days of the [[Seleucids]] and [[Greco-Bactrians]]) into the Arab world.\n\nThroughout the Abbasid era (750-1258), Merv remained the capital and most important city of [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasan]]. During this time, the Arab historian [[Al-Muqaddasi]] (c. 945/946 - 991) called Merv \"delightful, fine, elegant, brilliant, extensive, and pleasant\". Merv's architecture perhaps{{original research inline|date=July 2016}} provided the inspiration for the Abbasid re-planning of [[Baghdad]]. The city was notable as a home for immigrants from the Arab lands as well as for those from [[Sogdia]] and elsewhere in Central Asia (Herrmann 1999). In the period from 813 to 818, the temporary residency of the caliph [[al-Ma'mun]] effectively made Merv the capital of the Muslim world and highlighted Merv's importance to the Abbasids. Merv also became the center of a major 8th-century Neo-[[Mazdakite]] movement led by [[al-Muqanna]], the \"Veiled Prophet\", who gained many followers by claiming to be an incarnation of God and heir to Abu Muslim; the [[Khurramiyya]] inspired by him persisted in Merv until the 12th century.\n\nDuring this period Merv, like [[Samarkand]] and Bukhara, functioned as one of the great cities of Muslim scholarship; the celebrated historian [[Yaqut al-Hamawi|Yaqut]] (1179\u20131229) studied in its libraries. Merv produced a number of scholars in various branches of knowledge, such as [[Sharia|Islamic law]], [[hadith]], history, and literature. Several scholars have the name [[Marwazi (disambiguation)|Marwazi]] (\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0648\u0632\u064a) designating them as hailing from Merv, including{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} the famous [[Ahmad Ibn Hanbal]] (780\u2013855). The city continued to have a substantial Christian community. In 1009 the Archbishop of Merv sent a letter to the Patriarch at Baghdad asking that the [[Keraites]] be allowed to fast less than other Nestorian Christians.<ref>Cary-Elwes, Columba. ''China and the Cross''. (New York: P. J. Kennedy and Sons, 1956)</ref>\n\nAs the caliphate weakened, Arab rule in Merv was replaced by that of the [[Persia]]n general [[Tahir ibn Husayn|Tahir b. al -Husayn]] and his [[Tahirid]] dynasty in 821. The Tahirids ruled Merv from 821 to 873, followed by the [[Saffarids]] (873-), then the [[Samanids]] and later the [[Ghaznavids]].\n\n===Turks in Merv===\n{{History of the Turks pre-14th century}}\nIn 1037, the [[Seljuks]], a clan of [[Oghuz Turks]] moving from the steppes east of the [[Aral Sea]], peacefully took over Merv under the leadership of [[Toghril Beg]]\u2014the Ghaznavid sultan [[Mas'ud I of Ghazni|Masud]] was extremely unpopular in the city. Togrul's brother \u00c7agry stayed in Merv as the Seljuk domains grew to include the rest of Khurasan and Iran, and it subsequently became a favorite city of the Seljuk leadership. [[Alp Arslan]] (Sultan: 1063-1072) and his descendant Sultan [[Sanjar]] (died 1157) were both [[Tomb of Ahmed Sanjar|buried]] at Merv.\n\nDuring this period Merv expanded to its greatest size\u2014Arab and [[Persia]]n geographers termed it \"the mother of the world\", the \"rendezvous of great and small\", the \"chief city of Khurasan\" and the capital of the eastern Islamic world. Written sources also attest to a large library and [[madrasa]] founded by [[Nizam al-Mulk]] (Vizier: 1064-1092), as well as many other major cultural institutions. Perhaps most importantly, Merv was said{{by whom|date=July 2016}} to have a market that is \"the best of the major cities of Iran and Khurasan\" (Herrmann 1999).\n\nSanjar's rule, marked by conflict with the [[Kara-Khitai]] and [[Khwarezmid Empire|Khwarazmians]], ended in 1153 when Turkish [[Oghuz Turks|Ghuzz]] nomads from beyond the [[Amu Darya]] pillaged the city. Subsequently, Merv changed hands between the Khwarazmians of [[Khiva]], the Ghuzz, and the [[Ghurid dynasty|Ghurids]] - it began to lose importance relative to Khurasan's other major city, [[Nishapur]].\n\nDuring the 12th century Merv was one of the largest cities in the world. By 1210 it may have had as many as 500,000 residents.<ref name=\"Modelski\">[[George Modelski]], ''World Cities: \u20133000 to 2000'', Washington DC: FAROS 2000, 2003. {{ISBN|0-9676230-1-4}}.

Chandler defined a city as a continuously built-up area (urban) with suburbs but without farmland inside the municipality.</ref>\n\n===Mongols in Merv===\nIn 1221 Merv opened its gates to [[Tolui]], son of [[Genghis Khan]], chief of the [[Mongols]], on which occasion most of the inhabitants are said to have been butchered. The [[Persia]]n historian [[Ata al-Mulk Juvayni|Juvayni]], writing a generation after the destruction of Merv, wrote\n{{bquote|The Mongols ordered that, apart from four hundred artisans. .., the whole population, including the women and children, should be killed, and no one, whether woman or man, be spared. To each [Mongol soldier] was allotted the execution of three or four hundred Persians. So many had been killed by nightfall that the mountains became hillocks, and the plain was soaked with the blood of the mighty.}}\n\nSome historians{{Who|date=March 2012}} believe that over one million people died in the aftermath of the city's capture, including hundreds of thousands of refugees from elsewhere, making it one of the [[List of wars and anthropogenic disasters by death toll#Wars, armed conflicts, and genocides|most bloody captures of a city in world history]].\n\nExcavations revealed drastic rebuilding of the city's fortifications in the aftermath, but the prosperity of the city had passed. The Mongol invasion spelt the eclipse of Merv and indeed of other major centres for more than a century. After the Mongol conquest, Merv became part of the [[Ilkhanate]] and was consistently looted by [[Chagatai Khanate]]. In the early part of the 14th century the town became the seat of a Christian archbishopric of the Eastern Church under the rule of the [[Kartids]], vassals of the Ilkhanids. By 1380 Merv belonged to the empire of [[Timur]] (Tamerlane).\n\n===Uzbeks in Merv and its final destruction===\nIn 1505 the [[Uzbeks]] occupied Merv; five years later [[Shah Ismail]], the founder of the [[Safavids|Safavid dynasty]] of Persia, expelled them. In this period a [[Persia]]n nobleman restored a large dam (the 'Soltanbent') on the river [[Murgab River (Afghanistan)|Murghab]], and the settlement which grew up in the area thus irrigated became known as \"Ba\u00fdramaly\", as referenced in some 19th-century texts. Merv remained in the hands of Persia (except for periods of Uzbek rule between 1524 and 1528 and again between 1588 and 1598) until 1785, when Shah [[Murad Beg]], the [[Emirate of Bukhara|Emir of Bokhara]], captured the city. A few years later, in 1788 and 1789, the Bukharan [[Manghit]] king, Shah [[Murad Beg]] razed the city to the ground, broke down the dams, and converted the district into a waste. The entire population of the city and the surrounding oasis of about 100,000 were then deported in several stages to the Bukharan oasis and [[Samarkand]] region in the [[Zarafshan]] Valley. Being the last remaining [[Persian language|Persian]]-speaking [[Shias]], the deportees resisted assimilation into the Sunni population of [[Bukhara]] and [[Samarkand]], despite the common language of [[Persian language|Persian]] they spoke with most natives. These Marvis survive {{as of | 2016 | lc = on}} \u2014 Soviet censuses listed them as \"[[Iran]]is/Iranians\" through the 1980s. They live in [[Samarkand]] as well as in [[Bukhara]] and in the area in between on the [[Zarafshan]] river. They are listed as Persian-speaking, but counted separately from the local [[Tajiks]] due to their Shia religion and  the maintaining their ancient Mervi identity.\n\n===Nineteenth century===\n{{History of Turkmenistan}}\nMerv passed to the [[Khanate of Khiva]] in 1823. Sir [[Alexander Burnes]] traversed the country in 1832. About this time, the [[Teke tribe|Tekke]] [[Turkmens|Turkomans]], then living on the [[Hari River, Afghanistan|Tejen River]], were forced by the [[Persia]]ns to migrate northward. Khiva contested the advance of the Tekkes, but ultimately, about 1856, the latter became the sovereign power in the country, and remained so until the [[Russians]] occupied the oasis in 1884. By 1868 the Russians had taken most of [[Russian Central Asia]] except [[Turkmenistan]]. They approached this area from the Caspian and in 1881 [[Battle of Geok Tepe|captured Geok Tepe]]. Merv was taken bloodlessly by an officer named Alikhanov. A Muslim from the Caucasus, he had risen to the rank of major in the Russian service. After fighting a duel with a superior officer he was demoted to the ranks and by 1882 had risen to lieutenant. In 1882 he entered Merv, claiming to be a Russian merchant, and negotiated a [[trade agreement]]. Meanwhile, Russian agents had used a mixture of bribes and threats to develop a pro-Russian party in the area. The Russians occupied the oasis of [[Tejen]], eighty miles to the west. In 1884 Alikhanov entered Merv in the uniform of a Russian officer along with a number of Turkoman notables who had already submitted. He claimed that the troops at Tejen were the spearhead of a larger force and that local autonomy would be respected. Seeing no hope of support from Persia or Britain, the elders submitted.

Four walled cities correspond to the chief periods of Merv's importance: the oldest, Erkgala, corresponds to Achaemenid Merv, and is the smallest of the three. G\u00e4w\u00fcrgala (also known as  Gyaur Gala), which surrounds Erkgala, comprises the [[Hellenistic]] and [[Sassanian]] [[city|metropolis]] and also served as an [[industrial suburb]] to the Abbasid/Seljuk city, Soltangala \u2013 by far the largest of the three. The smaller [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] city was founded a short distance to the [[south]] and is now called Abdyllahangala. Various other ancient buildings are scattered between and around these four cities; all of the sites are preserved in the \u201cAncient Merv Archaeological Park\u201d just north of the modern village of Ba\u00fdramaly and thirty kilometers east of the large Soviet-built city of Mary ([[Georgina Herrmann|Herrmann]] 1993).\n\n====Erk Gala====\n[[File:Mervturkmenistan.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Erk Gala]] Erk Gala (from [[Persian language|Persian]], \"the citadel fort\") is the oldest part of the city of Merv complex. Built in the 7th century BC Erk Gala was built as a [[Persia]]n Style fortress controlling the [[oasis]] on the [[Murghab River]].<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://turkmenistan.gov.tm/_eng/?id=3028 |title=golden age |website=Turkmenistan.gov.tm |date= |accessdate=2016-10-21}}</ref>  The Erk Gala fortress later served as the [[acropolis]] for the [[Hellenistic]] city and later the Arc of the [[Islam]]ic city.\n\n====G\u00e4w\u00fcrgala====\nThe foundation of G\u00e4w\u00fcrgala ([[Turkmen people|Turkmen]] take from [[Persian language|Persian]] \"[[Gabr]] Qala\" (\"Fortress of the [[Zoroastrians]]\") occurred in the early [[Hellenistic]] era under the rule of the [[Seleucid]] king [[Antiochus I]]. The city was continuously inhabited under a series of [[Hellenistic]] rulers, by the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]], and subsequently under the Sassanids, who made it the capital of a satrapy. G\u00e4w\u00fcrgala was the capital of the [[Umayyad]] province of [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasan]] and grew in importance as Khurasan became the most loyally Muslim part of the Iranian world during Islam's first two centuries.\n[[File:Cyark merv 1.jpg|thumb|Photo-textured [[3D scanner|3D laser scan]] image of G\u00e4w\u00fcrgala town walls]]\n\nG\u00e4w\u00fcrgala's most visible remaining structures are its defensive installations. Three walls, one built atop the next, are in evidence. A Seleucid wall, graduated in the interior and straight on the exterior, forms a platform for the second, larger wall, built of mudbricks and stepped on the interior. The form of this wall is similar to other [[Hellenistic]] fortresses found in [[Anatolia]], though this unique for being made of mud-brick instead of stone. The third wall is possibly [[Sassanian]] and is built of larger bricks (Williams 2002). Surrounding the wall was a variety of pottery sherds, particularly Parthian ones. The size of these fortifications are evidence of Merv's importance during the pre-Islamic era; no pre-Islamic fortifications of comparable size have been found anywhere in the [[Garagum]]. G\u00e4w\u00fcrgala is also important for the vast amount of numismatic data that it has revealed; an unbroken series of [[Sassanian]] coins has been found there, hinting the extraordinary political stability of this period.\n\nEven after the foundation of Soltangala by Abu Muslim at the start of the Abbasid dynasty, G\u00e4w\u00fcrgala persisted as a suburb of the larger Soltangala. In G\u00e4w\u00fcrgala are concentrated many Abbasid-era \"industrial\" buildings: pottery kilns, steel, iron and copper-working workshops and so on. A well-preserved pottery kiln has an intact vaulted arch support and a square firepit. Gyaur Gala seems to have been the craftsmens' quarters throughout the Abbasid and pre-Seljuk periods (Herrmann, \"Seventh Season\" 13).<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://islamstory.com/en/node/27388 |title=Merv city &#124; Islam Story - Supervised by Dr. Ragheb Elsergany |publisher=Islam Story |date= |accessdate=2016-10-21}}</ref>\n\n====Soltangala====\n[[File:Sultan Sanjar mausoleum.jpg|thumb|Sultan Sanjar mausoleum]]\nSoltangala (from Sultan Qala, the sultan's fortress) is by far the largest of Merv's cities. Textual sources (Herrmann 1999){{cn|date=March 2017}} establish that it was [[Abu Muslim]], the leader of the [[Abbasid]] rebellion, who symbolized the beginning of the new Caliphate by commissioning monumental structures to the west of the G\u00e4w\u00fcrgala walls, in what then became Soltangala. The area was quickly walled and became the core of medieval Merv; centuries of prosperity which followed are attested to by the many Abbasid-era k\u00f6shks discovered in and outside of Soltangala. Kushks ([[Persian language|Persian]], Kushk, \"pavilion\", \"kiosk\"), which comprise the chief remains of Abbasid Merv, are a building type unique to Central Asia during this period. A kind of semi-fortified two-story palace whose corrugated walls give it a unique and striking appearance, k\u00f6shks were the residences of Merv's elite. The second story of these structures comprised living quarters; the first story may have been used for storage. Parapets lined the roof, which was often used for living quarters as well. Merv's largest and best-preserved Abbasid k\u00f6\u015fk is the Greater Gyzgala (Turkmen, \"maiden's fortress\"), located just outside the Soltangala's western wall; this structure consisted of 17 rooms surrounding a central courtyard. The nearby Lesser Gyzgala had extraordinarily thick walls with deep corrugations, as well as multiple interior stairways leading to second-story living quarters. All of Merv's kushks are in precarious states of preservation (Herrmann 1999).\n\nHowever, the most important of Soltangala's surviving buildings are Seljuk constructions. In the 11th century CE, the nomadic Oghuz Turks, formerly vassals of the [[Khwarazmshah]] in the northern steppes, began to move southward under the leadership of the Seljuk clan and its ruler Togrul Beg. Togrul's conquest of Merv in 1037 revitalized the city; under his descendants, especially Sanjar, who made it his residence, Merv found itself at the center of a large multicultural empire.\n\nEvidence of this prosperity is found throughout the Soltangala. Many of these are concentrated in Soltangala's citadel, the Shahryar Ark (Persian, \"the Sovereign's citadel\") of the, located on its east side. In the center of the Sharhryar Ark is located the Seljuk palace probably built by Sanjar. The surviving mud brick walls lead to the conclusion that this palace, relatively small, was composed of tall single-story rooms surrounding a central court along with four axial [[iwan]]s at the entrance to each side (Ettinghausen 276). Low areas nearby seem to indicate a large garden which included an artificial lake; similar gardens were found in other Central Asian palaces (Williams 2002). Any remnants of interior or exterior decoration have been lost due to erosion or theft.\n[[File:Cyark merv 2.jpg|thumb|Interior of Kepderihana, with a [[3D scanner|3D laser scanner]] positioned for work]]\n[[File:Cyark merv 3.jpg|thumb|Exterior of Kepderihana's south wall]]\nAnother notable Seljuk structure within the Shahryar Ark is the kepderihana (from [[Persian language|Persian]], \"Kaftar Khana, or \"pigeon house\", i.e., the [[columbarium]]). This mysterious building, among the best-preserved in the whole Merv oasis, comprises one long and narrow windowless room with many tiers of niches across the walls. It is believed by some [sources] that the kepter khana (there are more elsewhere in Merv and Central Asia) was indeed a pigeon roost used to raise pigeons, in order to collect their dung which is used in growing the melons for which Merv was famous. Others, just as justifiably (Herrmann 1999), see the kepderihanas as libraries or treasuries, due to their location in high status areas next to important structures.\n\nThe best-preserved of all the structures in Merv is the 12th-century [[mausoleum]] of [[Sultan Sanjar]], also in Sultan Gala. It is the largest of Seljuk mausoleums and is also the first dated mosque-mausoleum complex, a form which was later to become common. It is square, 27 meters per side, with two entrances on opposite sides; a large central dome supported by an octagonal system of ribs and arches covers the interior (Ettinghausen 270). The dome's exterior was turquoise, and its height made it quite imposing; it was said that approaching caravans could see the mausoleum while still a day's march from the city. The mausoleum's decoration, in typical early Seljuk style, was conservative, with interior stucco work and geometric brick decoration, now mainly lost, on the outside (Ettinghausen 271). With the exception of the recently \"reconstructed\" exterior decoration, the mausoleum is largely intact, and remains, just as is in the 12th century.\n\nA final set of [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk]] remains are the walls of the Soltangala. These fortifications, which in large part still remain, began as {{convert|8|to|9|m|ft|adj=mid|spell=in|-high}} mud brick structures, inside of which were chambers for defenders to shoot arrows from. There were horseshoe-shaped towers every {{convert|15|to|35|m|ft|0}}. These walls, however, did not prove to be effective because they were not of adequate thickness to withstand catapults and other artillery. By the mid-12th century, the galleries were filled in, and the wall was greatly strengthened. A secondary, smaller wall was built in front of the Soltangala's main wall, and finally the medieval city's suburbs \u2013 known today as Isgendergala \u2013 were enclosed by a {{convert|5|m|ft|adj=mid|-thick}} wall. The three walls sufficed to hold off the Mongol army for at least one of its offensives, before ultimately succumbing in 1221.<ref>Herrmann 2000</ref>\n\nMany ceramics have also been recovered from the Abbasid and Seljuk eras, primarily from G\u00e4w\u00fcrgala, the city walls of Soltangala, and the Shahryar Ark. The G\u00e4w\u00fcrgala ware was primarily late [[Abbasid]], and it consisted primarily of red slip-painted bowls with geometric designs. The pottery recovered from the Sultan Gala walls is dominated by 11th\u201312th-century color-splashed yellow and green pottery, similar to contemporary styles common in [[Nishapur]] (Herrmann 2000). Turquoise and black bowls were discovered in the Shahryar Ark palace, as well as an interesting deposit of Mongol-style pottery perhaps related to the city's unsuccessful re-foundation under the [[Il-khans]]. Also from this era is a ceramic mask used for decorating walls found among the ruins of what is believed \u2013 not without controversy \u2013 to be a [[Mongol]]-built [[Buddhist]] temple in the southern suburbs of Sultan Gala.<ref>Herrmann 1999</ref>\n\n====Shaim Kala====\n'''Shaim Kala''' was built in the 7th century [[Anno Domini|AD]]. Shaim Kala was a self-contained walled city intended to relieve the over-crowding, and to deal with religious and political discontent of the newly arrived peoples.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/merv/merv/#geographic |title=Merv |website=Ucl.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-10-21}}</ref>\n\n====Abdyllahangala====\nAbdyllahangala is the post medieval Timrid era city to the [[south]] of the main complex.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/886|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060227200324/https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/886|url-status=dead|archive-date=2006-02-27|title=State Historical and Cultural Park \"Ancient Merv\" - UNESCO World Heritage Centre|date=2006-02-27|access-date=2019-03-18}}</ref>\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:GreatKyzKala3.jpg|Great Kyz Qala\nFile:LittleKyzKala1.jpg|Little Kyz Qala\nFile:Cyark merv 3.jpg|part of Kyz Qala\nFile:SultanSanjarMausoleum1.jpg|Sultan Sanjar Mausoleum\nFile:Mosque in Merv.jpg|Mosque (Merv)\nFile:RR5012-0003R.png|Merv coin\n</gallery>\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe present inhabitants of the oasis are primarily [[Turkmens]] of the [[Teke tribe]] and some [[Persian people|Persians]]/[[Tajiks]]. There are relatively large minorities of the [[Baloch people|Beluch]]/[[Baluch people|Baluch]] and the [[Brahui people|Brahui]] in the Merv Oasis as well.\n\n== Economy ==\nThe oasis is irrigated by an elaborate system of canals cut from the Murghab. The country has at all times been renowned throughout the East for its fertility. Every kind of cereal and many fruits grow in great abundance, e.g. wheat, millet, barley and melons, also rice and cotton. Cotton seeds from archaeological levels as far back as the 5th century are the first indication that cotton textiles were already an important economic component of the Sassanian city. [[Silkworm]]s have been bred. The Turkomans possess a famous [[breed of horse]]s and keep camels, sheep, cattle, asses and mules. Turkomans are workers in silver and armour. One of the discoveries of the 1990s excavations was a 9th- to 10th-century workshop where [[crucible steel]] was being produced, confirming in detail contemporary Islamic reports by Islamic scholar, [[al-Kindi]] (AD 801\u2013866). He referred to the region of Khorasan as producing steel. This was made by a co-fusion process in which [[cast iron]] and [[wrought iron]] are melted together.<ref>{{cite journal|title= Crucible damascus steel: A fascination for almost 2,000 years|accessdate=7 October 2014 | doi=10.1007/s11837-006-0023-y|volume=58|journal=JOM|pages=48\u201350}}</ref><ref>Donald B.

Its area is about {{convert|1900|sqmi|km2}}. The great chain of mountains which, under the names of [[Paropamisade]] and [[Hindu Kush]], extends from the [[Caspian Sea]] to the [[Pamir Mountains]] is interrupted some {{convert|180|mi|km}} south of Merv. Through or near this gap flow northwards in parallel courses the [[Hari River, Afghanistan|Tejen]] and Murgab rivers, until they lose themselves in the Karakum Desert. Thus they make Merv a sort of watch tower over the entrance into Afghanistan on the north-west and at the same time create a stepping-stone or ''\u00e9tape'' between north-east [[Iran|Persia]] and the states of [[Bukhara|Bokhara]] and [[Samarkand]].\n\nMerv is advantageously situated in the inland delta of the Murghab River, which flows from its source in the Hindu Kush northwards through the Garagum desert. The Murghab delta region, known to the Greeks as [[Margiana]], gives Merv two distinct advantages: first, it provides an easy southeast-northwest route from the Afghan highlands towards the lowlands of Karakum, the [[Amu Darya]] valley and [[Khwarezm]]. Second, the Murgab delta, being a large well-watered zone in the midst of the dry Karakum, serves as a natural stopping-point for the routes from northwest Iran towards [[Transoxiana]] \u2013 the Silk Roads. The delta, and thus Merv, lies at the junction of these two routes: the northwest-southeast route to [[Herat]] and [[Balkh]] (to the [[Indus]] and beyond) and the southwest-northeast route from [[Tus, Iran|Tus]] and [[Nishapur]] to Bukhara and Samarkand.\n\nThis place was a stop on the Silk Road during the time of the Han dynasty. Here merchants could trade for fresh horses or camels at this [[oasis]] city.\n\n=== Climate ===\nMerv is dry and hot in summer and cold in winter. The heat of summer is oppressive. The wind raises clouds of fine dust which fill the air, rendering it opaque, almost obscuring the noonday sun. These clouds make breathing difficult. In winter the climate is pleasant. Snow falls rarely, and when it does, it melts at once. The annual rainfall rarely exceeds 125&nbsp;mm, and there is often no rain from June until October. While in summer temperatures can reach {{convert|45|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}, in winter they can be as low as {{convert|-7|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}. The average yearly temperature is {{convert|16|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}.\n\n== International relations ==\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Asia#Turkmenistan|l1=List of twin towns and sister cities in Turkmenistan}}\n\n===Twin towns and sister cities===\nMerv is [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with\n*{{flagicon|AFG}}&nbsp;[[Balkh]];\n*{{flagicon|AZE}}&nbsp;[[Baku]];\n*{{flagicon|PRC}}&nbsp;[[Wuhan]];\n*{{flagicon|CRO}}&nbsp;[[Zagreb]];\n*{{flagicon|EGY}}&nbsp;[[Cairo]];\n*{{flagicon|IRN}}&nbsp;[[Nishapur]], [[Tabriz]], [[Hamedan]] and [[Isfahan]];\n*{{flagicon|IRQ}}&nbsp;[[Baghdad]], [[Karbala]] and [[Kirkuk]];\n*{{flagicon|ISR}}&nbsp;[[Jerusalem]];\n*{{flagicon|ITA}}&nbsp;[[Venice]];\n*{{flagicon|KUW}}&nbsp;[[Kuwait City]];\n*{{flagicon|PAK}}&nbsp;[[Lahore]];\n*{{flagicon|PLE}}&nbsp;[[Gaza City|Gaza]];\n*{{flagicon|RUS}}&nbsp;[[Saint Petersburg]];\n*{{flagicon|KSA}}&nbsp;[[Medina]] and [[Mecca]];\n*{{flagicon|SYR}}&nbsp;[[Damascus]] and [[Aleppo]];\n*{{flagicon|TJK}}&nbsp;[[Khujand]];\n*{{flagicon|TUR}}&nbsp;[[Istanbul]], [[Konya]], [[Bursa]] and [[\u0130zmir]];\n*{{flagicon|TKM}}&nbsp;[[Nisa, Turkmenistan|Nisa]] and [[Old Urgench]];\n*{{flagicon|UAE}}&nbsp;[[Dubai]];\n*{{flagicon|UZB}}&nbsp;[[Bukhara]] and [[Samarkand]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Gunar Tepe]]\n*[[List of cities founded by Alexander the Great]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Sources and external links==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n{{Commons category|Merv}}\n{{wikivoyage|Merv}}\n;Sources\n{{EB1911|wstitle=Merv|volume=18|pages=175\u2013176}}\n* Ettinghausen, Richard; Grabar, Oleg (1994), The Art and Architecture of Islam 650-1250, New Haven: Yale UP\n* [[Georgina Herrmann|Herrmann, Georgina]] (1999), Monuments of Merv: Traditional Buildings of the Karakum, London: Society of Antiquaries of London, {{ISBN|0854312757}}\n* Herrmann, Georgina; Masson, VM; Kurbansakhatov, K (1992), \"The International Merv Project, Preliminary Report on the First Season (1992).\", Iran, 31, pp. 39\u201362.\n* Herrmann, Georgina; Kurbansakhatov, K (1993), \"The International Merv Project, Preliminary Report on the Second Season (1992).\", Iran, 32, pp. 53\u201375.\n* Herrmann, Georgina; Kurbansakhatov, K (2000), \"The International Merv Project, Preliminary Report on the Ninth Year (2000).\", Iran, 39, pp. 9\u201352.\n* Herrmann, Georgina; Kurbansakhatov, K (1999), \"The International Merv Project, Preliminary Report on the Seventh Season (1998).\", Iran, 37, pp. 9\u201352.\n* Williams, Tim; Kurbansakhatov, K (2002), \"The Ancient Merv Project, Turkmenistan.

Several cities have existed on this site, which is significant for the interchange of culture and politics at a site of major strategic value.\n\nHuman settlements on the site of Merv existed from the 3rd millennium BC until the 18th century AD. It changed hands repeatedly throughout its history. Under the [[Achaemenid Empire]], it was the centre of the satrapy of [[Margiana]]. It was subsequently ruled by the [[Greeks]], [[Arabs]], [[Seljuk Turks|Turks]] and the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid Persians]]. During the 12th and 13th centuries it became one of the largest cities in the world, having a population of as many as 500,000. In 1221 the city opened its gates to an invading [[Mongol Empire |Mongol]] [[Orda (organization) | horde]]; the resulting destruction of the city proved devastating. Historical accounts contend that the entire population (including refugees) of a million people were killed. \n\nThough rebuilt after the Mongol destruction, the city never regained its full former prosperity. Between 1788 and 1789 the city was razed for the last time, and its population deported. By the 1800s the city was completely deserted.\n\n[[UNESCO]] has listed the site of ancient Merv as a [[World Heritage Site]].<ref>\nSee [[List of World Heritage Sites in Turkmenistan]].\n</ref>\n\n== History ==\nMerv has prehistoric roots: archaeological surveys have revealed many traces of village life as far back as the 3rd millennium BC and have associated the area culturally with the [[Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex]].

After Alexander's death in 323 BC, it became the capital of the [[Margu|Province of Margiana]] of the [[Seleucid]], [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom|Greco-Bactrian]] (256-125 BC), [[Parthia]]n, and [[Sassanid dynasty|Sassanid]] states. \nThe Seleucid ruler [[Antiochus Soter]] (reigned 281\u2013261 BC) renamed it to Antiochia Margiana; he rebuilt and expanded the city at the site presently known as [[Gyaur Gala]] (G\u00e4w\u00fcrgala) fortress.

During this period Merv was home to practitioners of various religions beside the official Sassanid [[Zoroastrianism]], including Buddhists, [[Manichaeism|Manichaeans]], and Christians of the [[Church of the East]]. Between the 6th (553) and 11th centuries AD, Merv served as the seat of an [[Nestorianism|East Syrian]] [[Merv (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)|metropolitan province]], key in the Dualist church's mission east up the Silk Road to Turkestan and China. The [[Hephthalite]] occupation from the end of the 5th century to 565 AD briefly interrupted Sassanid rule.\n\n===Arab conquest and influence===\n{{Campaignbox Muslim Conquest Persia}}\n<!-- (this place was a little colder because it was in the mountains)  -->\n[[File:Marv (peutinger Map).png|thumb|left|The city of Marv, Turkmenistan in the 4th century as shown on the [[Peutinger Map]]]][[Sassanian]] rule came to an end when the last Sassanian ruler, [[Yazdegerd III]] (632\u2013651) was killed not far from the city and the Sassanian military governor surrendered to the approaching Arab army. Representatives of the caliph [[Umar]] occupied the city, which became the capital of the [[Umayyad]] province of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]. In 671 [[Ziyad ibn Abi Sufyan]] sent 50,000 Arab troops to Merv as a colony. This colony retained its native [[Kufa]]n sympathies and became the nucleus of Khurasan.<ref>Muir pp. 295\u20136</ref> Using the city as their base, the Arabs, led by [[Qutayba ibn Muslim]] from 705 to 715, brought under subjection large parts of Central Asia, including [[Balkh]], [[Bukhara|Bokhara]], and [[Fergana]].

Arab immigration to the area was substantial. A Chinese captured at Talas, [[Du Huan]], was brought to [[Baghdad]] and toured the caliphate.

After the Abbasids became established in [[Baghdad]], Abu Muslim continued to rule Merv as a semi-independent prince until his eventual assassination. Indeed, Merv operated as the center of [[Abbasid]] partisanship for the duration of the [[Abbasid Revolution]] of 746-750, and later on became a consistent source of political support for the Abbasid rulers in [[Baghdad]]; the governorship of Khurasan at Merv was considered{{by whom|date=July 2016}} one of the most important political figures of the [[Caliphate]]. The influential [[Barmakid]] family, based in Merv, played an important part in transferring Greek knowledge (established in Merv since the days of the [[Seleucids]] and [[Greco-Bactrians]]) into the Arab world.\n\nThroughout the Abbasid era (750-1258), Merv remained the capital and most important city of [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasan]]. During this time, the Arab historian [[Al-Muqaddasi]] (c. 945/946 - 991) called Merv \"delightful, fine, elegant, brilliant, extensive, and pleasant\". Merv's architecture perhaps{{original research inline|date=July 2016}} provided the inspiration for the Abbasid re-planning of [[Baghdad]]. The city was notable as a home for immigrants from the Arab lands as well as for those from [[Sogdia]] and elsewhere in Central Asia (Herrmann 1999). In the period from 813 to 818, the temporary residency of the caliph [[al-Ma'mun]] effectively made Merv the capital of the Muslim world and highlighted Merv's importance to the Abbasids. Merv also became the center of a major 8th-century Neo-[[Mazdakite]] movement led by [[al-Muqanna]], the \"Veiled Prophet\", who gained many followers by claiming to be an incarnation of God and heir to Abu Muslim; the [[Khurramiyya]] inspired by him persisted in Merv until the 12th century.\n\nDuring this period Merv, like [[Samarkand]] and Bukhara, functioned as one of the great cities of Muslim scholarship; the celebrated historian [[Yaqut al-Hamawi|Yaqut]] (1179\u20131229) studied in its libraries. Merv produced a number of scholars in various branches of knowledge, such as [[Sharia|Islamic law]], [[hadith]], history, and literature. Several scholars have the name [[Marwazi (disambiguation)|Marwazi]] (\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0648\u0632\u064a) designating them as hailing from Merv, including{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} the famous [[Ahmad Ibn Hanbal]] (780\u2013855). The city continued to have a substantial Christian community. In 1009 the Archbishop of Merv sent a letter to the Patriarch at Baghdad asking that the [[Keraites]] be allowed to fast less than other Nestorian Christians.<ref>Cary-Elwes, Columba. ''China and the Cross''. (New York: P. J. Kennedy and Sons, 1956)</ref>\n\nAs the caliphate weakened, Arab rule in Merv was replaced by that of the [[Persia]]n general [[Tahir ibn Husayn|Tahir b. al -Husayn]] and his [[Tahirid]] dynasty in 821. The Tahirids ruled Merv from 821 to 873, followed by the [[Saffarids]] (873-), then the [[Samanids]] and later the [[Ghaznavids]].\n\n===Turks in Merv===\n{{History of the Turks pre-14th century}}\nIn 1037, the [[Seljuks]], a clan of [[Oghuz Turks]] moving from the steppes east of the [[Aral Sea]], peacefully took over Merv under the leadership of [[Toghril Beg]]\u2014the Ghaznavid sultan [[Mas'ud I of Ghazni|Masud]] was extremely unpopular in the city. Togrul's brother \u00c7agry stayed in Merv as the Seljuk domains grew to include the rest of Khurasan and Iran, and it subsequently became a favorite city of the Seljuk leadership. [[Alp Arslan]] (Sultan: 1063-1072) and his descendant Sultan [[Sanjar]] (died 1157) were both [[Tomb of Ahmed Sanjar|buried]] at Merv.\n\nDuring this period Merv expanded to its greatest size\u2014Arab and [[Persia]]n geographers termed it \"the mother of the world\", the \"rendezvous of great and small\", the \"chief city of Khurasan\" and the capital of the eastern Islamic world. Written sources also attest to a large library and [[madrasa]] founded by [[Nizam al-Mulk]] (Vizier: 1064-1092), as well as many other major cultural institutions. Perhaps most importantly, Merv was said{{by whom|date=July 2016}} to have a market that is \"the best of the major cities of Iran and Khurasan\" (Herrmann 1999).\n\nSanjar's rule, marked by conflict with the [[Kara-Khitai]] and [[Khwarezmid Empire|Khwarazmians]], ended in 1153 when Turkish [[Oghuz Turks|Ghuzz]] nomads from beyond the [[Amu Darya]] pillaged the city. Subsequently, Merv changed hands between the Khwarazmians of [[Khiva]], the Ghuzz, and the [[Ghurid dynasty|Ghurids]] - it began to lose importance relative to Khurasan's other major city, [[Nishapur]].\n\nDuring the 12th century Merv was one of the largest cities in the world. By 1210 it may have had as many as 500,000 residents.<ref name=\"Modelski\">[[George Modelski]], ''World Cities: \u20133000 to 2000'', Washington DC: FAROS 2000, 2003. {{ISBN|0-9676230-1-4}}.

Chandler defined a city as a continuously built-up area (urban) with suburbs but without farmland inside the municipality.</ref>\n\n===Mongols in Merv===\nIn 1221 Merv opened its gates to [[Tolui]], son of [[Genghis Khan]], chief of the [[Mongols]], on which occasion most of the inhabitants are said to have been butchered. The [[Persia]]n historian [[Ata al-Mulk Juvayni|Juvayni]], writing a generation after the destruction of Merv, wrote\n{{bquote|The Mongols ordered that, apart from four hundred artisans. .., the whole population, including the women and children, should be killed, and no one, whether woman or man, be spared. To each [Mongol soldier] was allotted the execution of three or four hundred Persians. So many had been killed by nightfall that the mountains became hillocks, and the plain was soaked with the blood of the mighty.}}\n\nSome historians{{Who|date=March 2012}} believe that over one million people died in the aftermath of the city's capture, including hundreds of thousands of refugees from elsewhere, making it one of the [[List of wars and anthropogenic disasters by death toll#Wars, armed conflicts, and genocides|most bloody captures of a city in world history]].\n\nExcavations revealed drastic rebuilding of the city's fortifications in the aftermath, but the prosperity of the city had passed. The Mongol invasion spelt the eclipse of Merv and indeed of other major centres for more than a century. After the Mongol conquest, Merv became part of the [[Ilkhanate]] and was consistently looted by [[Chagatai Khanate]]. In the early part of the 14th century the town became the seat of a Christian archbishopric of the Eastern Church under the rule of the [[Kartids]], vassals of the Ilkhanids. By 1380 Merv belonged to the empire of [[Timur]] (Tamerlane).\n\n===Uzbeks in Merv and its final destruction===\nIn 1505 the [[Uzbeks]] occupied Merv; five years later [[Shah Ismail]], the founder of the [[Safavids|Safavid dynasty]] of Persia, expelled them. In this period a [[Persia]]n nobleman restored a large dam (the 'Soltanbent') on the river [[Murgab River (Afghanistan)|Murghab]], and the settlement which grew up in the area thus irrigated became known as \"Ba\u00fdramaly\", as referenced in some 19th-century texts. Merv remained in the hands of Persia (except for periods of Uzbek rule between 1524 and 1528 and again between 1588 and 1598) until 1785, when Shah [[Murad Beg]], the [[Emirate of Bukhara|Emir of Bokhara]], captured the city. A few years later, in 1788 and 1789, the Bukharan [[Manghit]] king, Shah [[Murad Beg]] razed the city to the ground, broke down the dams, and converted the district into a waste. The entire population of the city and the surrounding oasis of about 100,000 were then deported in several stages to the Bukharan oasis and [[Samarkand]] region in the [[Zarafshan]] Valley. Being the last remaining [[Persian language|Persian]]-speaking [[Shias]], the deportees resisted assimilation into the Sunni population of [[Bukhara]] and [[Samarkand]], despite the common language of [[Persian language|Persian]] they spoke with most natives. These Marvis survive {{as of | 2016 | lc = on}} \u2014 Soviet censuses listed them as \"[[Iran]]is/Iranians\" through the 1980s. They live in [[Samarkand]] as well as in [[Bukhara]] and in the area in between on the [[Zarafshan]] river. They are listed as Persian-speaking, but counted separately from the local [[Tajiks]] due to their Shia religion and  the maintaining their ancient Mervi identity.\n\n===Nineteenth century===\n{{History of Turkmenistan}}\nMerv passed to the [[Khanate of Khiva]] in 1823. Sir [[Alexander Burnes]] traversed the country in 1832. About this time, the [[Teke tribe|Tekke]] [[Turkmens|Turkomans]], then living on the [[Hari River, Afghanistan|Tejen River]], were forced by the [[Persia]]ns to migrate northward. Khiva contested the advance of the Tekkes, but ultimately, about 1856, the latter became the sovereign power in the country, and remained so until the [[Russians]] occupied the oasis in 1884. By 1868 the Russians had taken most of [[Russian Central Asia]] except [[Turkmenistan]]. They approached this area from the Caspian and in 1881 [[Battle of Geok Tepe|captured Geok Tepe]]. Merv was taken bloodlessly by an officer named Alikhanov. A Muslim from the Caucasus, he had risen to the rank of major in the Russian service. After fighting a duel with a superior officer he was demoted to the ranks and by 1882 had risen to lieutenant. In 1882 he entered Merv, claiming to be a Russian merchant, and negotiated a [[trade agreement]]. Meanwhile, Russian agents had used a mixture of bribes and threats to develop a pro-Russian party in the area. The Russians occupied the oasis of [[Tejen]], eighty miles to the west. In 1884 Alikhanov entered Merv in the uniform of a Russian officer along with a number of Turkoman notables who had already submitted. He claimed that the troops at Tejen were the spearhead of a larger force and that local autonomy would be respected. Seeing no hope of support from Persia or Britain, the elders submitted. The next Russian move was south [[Pandjeh Incident|toward Herat]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}} By 1888 the city was entirely abandoned.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/aug/12/lost-cities-merv-worlds-biggest-city-razed-turkmenistan|title=Lost cities #5: how the magnificent city of Merv was razed \u2013 and never recovered|last=Tharoor|first=Kanishk|date=2016-08-12|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-03-18|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\n== Remains ==\nSome exploratory excavations at Merv were conducted in 1885<ref>Merv, controlling the route from [[Herat]], was conquered by Komarov's troops without much resistance in 1885, part of the [[Great Game]]: Andr\u00e9 Kamev, ''Le Turkm\u00e9nistan'' 2005:104</ref> by the Russian general A.V.

Four walled cities correspond to the chief periods of Merv's importance: the oldest, Erkgala, corresponds to Achaemenid Merv, and is the smallest of the three. G\u00e4w\u00fcrgala (also known as  Gyaur Gala), which surrounds Erkgala, comprises the [[Hellenistic]] and [[Sassanian]] [[city|metropolis]] and also served as an [[industrial suburb]] to the Abbasid/Seljuk city, Soltangala \u2013 by far the largest of the three. The smaller [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] city was founded a short distance to the [[south]] and is now called Abdyllahangala. Various other ancient buildings are scattered between and around these four cities; all of the sites are preserved in the \u201cAncient Merv Archaeological Park\u201d just north of the modern village of Ba\u00fdramaly and thirty kilometers east of the large Soviet-built city of Mary ([[Georgina Herrmann|Herrmann]] 1993).\n\n====Erk Gala====\n[[File:Mervturkmenistan.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Erk Gala]] Erk Gala (from [[Persian language|Persian]], \"the citadel fort\") is the oldest part of the city of Merv complex. Built in the 7th century BC Erk Gala was built as a [[Persia]]n Style fortress controlling the [[oasis]] on the [[Murghab River]].<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://turkmenistan.gov.tm/_eng/?id=3028 |title=golden age |website=Turkmenistan.gov.tm |date= |accessdate=2016-10-21}}</ref>  The Erk Gala fortress later served as the [[acropolis]] for the [[Hellenistic]] city and later the Arc of the [[Islam]]ic city.\n\n====G\u00e4w\u00fcrgala====\nThe foundation of G\u00e4w\u00fcrgala ([[Turkmen people|Turkmen]] take from [[Persian language|Persian]] \"[[Gabr]] Qala\" (\"Fortress of the [[Zoroastrians]]\") occurred in the early [[Hellenistic]] era under the rule of the [[Seleucid]] king [[Antiochus I]]. The city was continuously inhabited under a series of [[Hellenistic]] rulers, by the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]], and subsequently under the Sassanids, who made it the capital of a satrapy. G\u00e4w\u00fcrgala was the capital of the [[Umayyad]] province of [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasan]] and grew in importance as Khurasan became the most loyally Muslim part of the Iranian world during Islam's first two centuries.\n[[File:Cyark merv 1.jpg|thumb|Photo-textured [[3D scanner|3D laser scan]] image of G\u00e4w\u00fcrgala town walls]]\n\nG\u00e4w\u00fcrgala's most visible remaining structures are its defensive installations. Three walls, one built atop the next, are in evidence. A Seleucid wall, graduated in the interior and straight on the exterior, forms a platform for the second, larger wall, built of mudbricks and stepped on the interior. The form of this wall is similar to other [[Hellenistic]] fortresses found in [[Anatolia]], though this unique for being made of mud-brick instead of stone. The third wall is possibly [[Sassanian]] and is built of larger bricks (Williams 2002). Surrounding the wall was a variety of pottery sherds, particularly Parthian ones. The size of these fortifications are evidence of Merv's importance during the pre-Islamic era; no pre-Islamic fortifications of comparable size have been found anywhere in the [[Garagum]]. G\u00e4w\u00fcrgala is also important for the vast amount of numismatic data that it has revealed; an unbroken series of [[Sassanian]] coins has been found there, hinting the extraordinary political stability of this period.\n\nEven after the foundation of Soltangala by Abu Muslim at the start of the Abbasid dynasty, G\u00e4w\u00fcrgala persisted as a suburb of the larger Soltangala. In G\u00e4w\u00fcrgala are concentrated many Abbasid-era \"industrial\" buildings: pottery kilns, steel, iron and copper-working workshops and so on. A well-preserved pottery kiln has an intact vaulted arch support and a square firepit. Gyaur Gala seems to have been the craftsmens' quarters throughout the Abbasid and pre-Seljuk periods (Herrmann, \"Seventh Season\" 13).<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://islamstory.com/en/node/27388 |title=Merv city &#124; Islam Story - Supervised by Dr. Ragheb Elsergany |publisher=Islam Story |date= |accessdate=2016-10-21}}</ref>\n\n====Soltangala====\n[[File:Sultan Sanjar mausoleum.jpg|thumb|Sultan Sanjar mausoleum]]\nSoltangala (from Sultan Qala, the sultan's fortress) is by far the largest of Merv's cities. Textual sources (Herrmann 1999){{cn|date=March 2017}} establish that it was [[Abu Muslim]], the leader of the [[Abbasid]] rebellion, who symbolized the beginning of the new Caliphate by commissioning monumental structures to the west of the G\u00e4w\u00fcrgala walls, in what then became Soltangala. The area was quickly walled and became the core of medieval Merv; centuries of prosperity which followed are attested to by the many Abbasid-era k\u00f6shks discovered in and outside of Soltangala. Kushks ([[Persian language|Persian]], Kushk, \"pavilion\", \"kiosk\"), which comprise the chief remains of Abbasid Merv, are a building type unique to Central Asia during this period. A kind of semi-fortified two-story palace whose corrugated walls give it a unique and striking appearance, k\u00f6shks were the residences of Merv's elite. The second story of these structures comprised living quarters; the first story may have been used for storage. Parapets lined the roof, which was often used for living quarters as well. Merv's largest and best-preserved Abbasid k\u00f6\u015fk is the Greater Gyzgala (Turkmen, \"maiden's fortress\"), located just outside the Soltangala's western wall; this structure consisted of 17 rooms surrounding a central courtyard. The nearby Lesser Gyzgala had extraordinarily thick walls with deep corrugations, as well as multiple interior stairways leading to second-story living quarters. All of Merv's kushks are in precarious states of preservation (Herrmann 1999).\n\nHowever, the most important of Soltangala's surviving buildings are Seljuk constructions. In the 11th century CE, the nomadic Oghuz Turks, formerly vassals of the [[Khwarazmshah]] in the northern steppes, began to move southward under the leadership of the Seljuk clan and its ruler Togrul Beg. Togrul's conquest of Merv in 1037 revitalized the city; under his descendants, especially Sanjar, who made it his residence, Merv found itself at the center of a large multicultural empire.\n\nEvidence of this prosperity is found throughout the Soltangala. Many of these are concentrated in Soltangala's citadel, the Shahryar Ark (Persian, \"the Sovereign's citadel\") of the, located on its east side. In the center of the Sharhryar Ark is located the Seljuk palace probably built by Sanjar. The surviving mud brick walls lead to the conclusion that this palace, relatively small, was composed of tall single-story rooms surrounding a central court along with four axial [[iwan]]s at the entrance to each side (Ettinghausen 276). Low areas nearby seem to indicate a large garden which included an artificial lake; similar gardens were found in other Central Asian palaces (Williams 2002). Any remnants of interior or exterior decoration have been lost due to erosion or theft.\n[[File:Cyark merv 2.jpg|thumb|Interior of Kepderihana, with a [[3D scanner|3D laser scanner]] positioned for work]]\n[[File:Cyark merv 3.jpg|thumb|Exterior of Kepderihana's south wall]]\nAnother notable Seljuk structure within the Shahryar Ark is the kepderihana (from [[Persian language|Persian]], \"Kaftar Khana, or \"pigeon house\", i.e., the [[columbarium]]). This mysterious building, among the best-preserved in the whole Merv oasis, comprises one long and narrow windowless room with many tiers of niches across the walls. It is believed by some [sources] that the kepter khana (there are more elsewhere in Merv and Central Asia) was indeed a pigeon roost used to raise pigeons, in order to collect their dung which is used in growing the melons for which Merv was famous. Others, just as justifiably (Herrmann 1999), see the kepderihanas as libraries or treasuries, due to their location in high status areas next to important structures.\n\nThe best-preserved of all the structures in Merv is the 12th-century [[mausoleum]] of [[Sultan Sanjar]], also in Sultan Gala. It is the largest of Seljuk mausoleums and is also the first dated mosque-mausoleum complex, a form which was later to become common. It is square, 27 meters per side, with two entrances on opposite sides; a large central dome supported by an octagonal system of ribs and arches covers the interior (Ettinghausen 270). The dome's exterior was turquoise, and its height made it quite imposing; it was said that approaching caravans could see the mausoleum while still a day's march from the city. The mausoleum's decoration, in typical early Seljuk style, was conservative, with interior stucco work and geometric brick decoration, now mainly lost, on the outside (Ettinghausen 271). With the exception of the recently \"reconstructed\" exterior decoration, the mausoleum is largely intact, and remains, just as is in the 12th century.\n\nA final set of [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk]] remains are the walls of the Soltangala. These fortifications, which in large part still remain, began as {{convert|8|to|9|m|ft|adj=mid|spell=in|-high}} mud brick structures, inside of which were chambers for defenders to shoot arrows from. There were horseshoe-shaped towers every {{convert|15|to|35|m|ft|0}}. These walls, however, did not prove to be effective because they were not of adequate thickness to withstand catapults and other artillery. By the mid-12th century, the galleries were filled in, and the wall was greatly strengthened. A secondary, smaller wall was built in front of the Soltangala's main wall, and finally the medieval city's suburbs \u2013 known today as Isgendergala \u2013 were enclosed by a {{convert|5|m|ft|adj=mid|-thick}} wall. The three walls sufficed to hold off the Mongol army for at least one of its offensives, before ultimately succumbing in 1221.<ref>Herrmann 2000</ref>\n\nMany ceramics have also been recovered from the Abbasid and Seljuk eras, primarily from G\u00e4w\u00fcrgala, the city walls of Soltangala, and the Shahryar Ark. The G\u00e4w\u00fcrgala ware was primarily late [[Abbasid]], and it consisted primarily of red slip-painted bowls with geometric designs. The pottery recovered from the Sultan Gala walls is dominated by 11th\u201312th-century color-splashed yellow and green pottery, similar to contemporary styles common in [[Nishapur]] (Herrmann 2000). Turquoise and black bowls were discovered in the Shahryar Ark palace, as well as an interesting deposit of Mongol-style pottery perhaps related to the city's unsuccessful re-foundation under the [[Il-khans]]. Also from this era is a ceramic mask used for decorating walls found among the ruins of what is believed \u2013 not without controversy \u2013 to be a [[Mongol]]-built [[Buddhist]] temple in the southern suburbs of Sultan Gala.<ref>Herrmann 1999</ref>\n\n====Shaim Kala====\n'''Shaim Kala''' was built in the 7th century [[Anno Domini|AD]]. Shaim Kala was a self-contained walled city intended to relieve the over-crowding, and to deal with religious and political discontent of the newly arrived peoples.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/merv/merv/#geographic |title=Merv |website=Ucl.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-10-21}}</ref>\n\n====Abdyllahangala====\nAbdyllahangala is the post medieval Timrid era city to the [[south]] of the main complex.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/886|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060227200324/https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/886|url-status=dead|archive-date=2006-02-27|title=State Historical and Cultural Park \"Ancient Merv\" - UNESCO World Heritage Centre|date=2006-02-27|access-date=2019-03-18}}</ref>\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:GreatKyzKala3.jpg|Great Kyz Qala\nFile:LittleKyzKala1.jpg|Little Kyz Qala\nFile:Cyark merv 3.jpg|part of Kyz Qala\nFile:SultanSanjarMausoleum1.jpg|Sultan Sanjar Mausoleum\nFile:Mosque in Merv.jpg|Mosque (Merv)\nFile:RR5012-0003R.png|Merv coin\n</gallery>\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe present inhabitants of the oasis are primarily [[Turkmens]] of the [[Teke tribe]] and some [[Persian people|Persians]]/[[Tajiks]]. There are relatively large minorities of the [[Baloch people|Beluch]]/[[Baluch people|Baluch]] and the [[Brahui people|Brahui]] in the Merv Oasis as well.\n\n== Economy ==\nThe oasis is irrigated by an elaborate system of canals cut from the Murghab. The country has at all times been renowned throughout the East for its fertility. Every kind of cereal and many fruits grow in great abundance, e.g. wheat, millet, barley and melons, also rice and cotton. Cotton seeds from archaeological levels as far back as the 5th century are the first indication that cotton textiles were already an important economic component of the Sassanian city. [[Silkworm]]s have been bred. The Turkomans possess a famous [[breed of horse]]s and keep camels, sheep, cattle, asses and mules. Turkomans are workers in silver and armour. One of the discoveries of the 1990s excavations was a 9th- to 10th-century workshop where [[crucible steel]] was being produced, confirming in detail contemporary Islamic reports by Islamic scholar, [[al-Kindi]] (AD 801\u2013866). He referred to the region of Khorasan as producing steel. This was made by a co-fusion process in which [[cast iron]] and [[wrought iron]] are melted together.<ref>{{cite journal|title= Crucible damascus steel: A fascination for almost 2,000 years|accessdate=7 October 2014 | doi=10.1007/s11837-006-0023-y|volume=58|journal=JOM|pages=48\u201350}}</ref><ref>Donald B.

Its area is about {{convert|1900|sqmi|km2}}. The great chain of mountains which, under the names of [[Paropamisade]] and [[Hindu Kush]], extends from the [[Caspian Sea]] to the [[Pamir Mountains]] is interrupted some {{convert|180|mi|km}} south of Merv. Through or near this gap flow northwards in parallel courses the [[Hari River, Afghanistan|Tejen]] and Murgab rivers, until they lose themselves in the Karakum Desert. Thus they make Merv a sort of watch tower over the entrance into Afghanistan on the north-west and at the same time create a stepping-stone or ''\u00e9tape'' between north-east [[Iran|Persia]] and the states of [[Bukhara|Bokhara]] and [[Samarkand]].\n\nMerv is advantageously situated in the inland delta of the Murghab River, which flows from its source in the Hindu Kush northwards through the Garagum desert. The Murghab delta region, known to the Greeks as [[Margiana]], gives Merv two distinct advantages: first, it provides an easy southeast-northwest route from the Afghan highlands towards the lowlands of Karakum, the [[Amu Darya]] valley and [[Khwarezm]]. Second, the Murgab delta, being a large well-watered zone in the midst of the dry Karakum, serves as a natural stopping-point for the routes from northwest Iran towards [[Transoxiana]] \u2013 the Silk Roads. The delta, and thus Merv, lies at the junction of these two routes: the northwest-southeast route to [[Herat]] and [[Balkh]] (to the [[Indus]] and beyond) and the southwest-northeast route from [[Tus, Iran|Tus]] and [[Nishapur]] to Bukhara and Samarkand.\n\nThis place was a stop on the Silk Road during the time of the Han dynasty. Here merchants could trade for fresh horses or camels at this [[oasis]] city.\n\n=== Climate ===\nMerv is dry and hot in summer and cold in winter. The heat of summer is oppressive. The wind raises clouds of fine dust which fill the air, rendering it opaque, almost obscuring the noonday sun. These clouds make breathing difficult. In winter the climate is pleasant. Snow falls rarely, and when it does, it melts at once. The annual rainfall rarely exceeds 125&nbsp;mm, and there is often no rain from June until October. While in summer temperatures can reach {{convert|45|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}, in winter they can be as low as {{convert|-7|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}. The average yearly temperature is {{convert|16|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}.\n\n== International relations ==\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Asia#Turkmenistan|l1=List of twin towns and sister cities in Turkmenistan}}\n\n===Twin towns and sister cities===\nMerv is [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with\n*{{flagicon|AFG}}&nbsp;[[Balkh]];\n*{{flagicon|AZE}}&nbsp;[[Baku]];\n*{{flagicon|PRC}}&nbsp;[[Wuhan]];\n*{{flagicon|CRO}}&nbsp;[[Zagreb]];\n*{{flagicon|EGY}}&nbsp;[[Cairo]];\n*{{flagicon|IRN}}&nbsp;[[Nishapur]], [[Tabriz]], [[Hamedan]] and [[Isfahan]];\n*{{flagicon|IRQ}}&nbsp;[[Baghdad]], [[Karbala]] and [[Kirkuk]];\n*{{flagicon|ISR}}&nbsp;[[Jerusalem]];\n*{{flagicon|ITA}}&nbsp;[[Venice]];\n*{{flagicon|KUW}}&nbsp;[[Kuwait City]];\n*{{flagicon|PAK}}&nbsp;[[Lahore]];\n*{{flagicon|PLE}}&nbsp;[[Gaza City|Gaza]];\n*{{flagicon|RUS}}&nbsp;[[Saint Petersburg]];\n*{{flagicon|KSA}}&nbsp;[[Medina]] and [[Mecca]];\n*{{flagicon|SYR}}&nbsp;[[Damascus]] and [[Aleppo]];\n*{{flagicon|TJK}}&nbsp;[[Khujand]];\n*{{flagicon|TUR}}&nbsp;[[Istanbul]], [[Konya]], [[Bursa]] and [[\u0130zmir]];\n*{{flagicon|TKM}}&nbsp;[[Nisa, Turkmenistan|Nisa]] and [[Old Urgench]];\n*{{flagicon|UAE}}&nbsp;[[Dubai]];\n*{{flagicon|UZB}}&nbsp;[[Bukhara]] and [[Samarkand]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Gunar Tepe]]\n*[[List of cities founded by Alexander the Great]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Sources and external links==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n{{Commons category|Merv}}\n{{wikivoyage|Merv}}\n;Sources\n{{EB1911|wstitle=Merv|volume=18|pages=175\u2013176}}\n* Ettinghausen, Richard; Grabar, Oleg (1994), The Art and Architecture of Islam 650-1250, New Haven: Yale UP\n* [[Georgina Herrmann|Herrmann, Georgina]] (1999), Monuments of Merv: Traditional Buildings of the Karakum, London: Society of Antiquaries of London, {{ISBN|0854312757}}\n* Herrmann, Georgina; Masson, VM; Kurbansakhatov, K (1992), \"The International Merv Project, Preliminary Report on the First Season (1992).\", Iran, 31, pp. 39\u201362.\n* Herrmann, Georgina; Kurbansakhatov, K (1993), \"The International Merv Project, Preliminary Report on the Second Season (1992).\", Iran, 32, pp. 53\u201375.\n* Herrmann, Georgina; Kurbansakhatov, K (2000), \"The International Merv Project, Preliminary Report on the Ninth Year (2000).\", Iran, 39, pp. 9\u201352.\n* Herrmann, Georgina; Kurbansakhatov, K (1999), \"The International Merv Project, Preliminary Report on the Seventh Season (1998).\", Iran, 37, pp. 9\u201352.\n* Williams, Tim; Kurbansakhatov, K (2002), \"The Ancient Merv Project, Turkmenistan.

It was fully acquired by [[Bertelsmann]] in 1986, making it a part of [[Bertelsmann Music Group]] (BMG); however, RCA Records became a part of [[Sony BMG Music Entertainment]], a merger between BMG and Sony Music, in 2004, and was acquired by the latter in 2008, after the dissolution of Sony BMG and the restructuring of Sony Music.

The company then became '''RCA Victor'''. In absorbing Victor, RCA acquired the [[New World]] rights to the famous [[Nipper]]/\"[[His Master's Voice]]\" [[trademark]].\nIn 1931, RCA Victor's British affiliate the [[Gramophone Company]] merged with the [[Columbia Graphophone Company]] to form [[EMI]]. This gave RCA head [[David Sarnoff]] a seat on the EMI board.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sanjek |first1=Russell |title=American Popular Music and Its Business: The First Four Hundred Years ... |date=July 28, 1998 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=London |isbn=9780195043112 |page=118 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=EzVesnkLEtUC&pg=PA119&lpg=PA119&dq=%22david+sarnoff%22%2B+emi+%2B+board#v=onepage&q=%22david%20sarnoff%22%2B%20emi%20%2B%20board&f=false |accessdate=August 19, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn September 1931, RCA Victor introduced the first 33\u2153 rpm records sold to the public, calling them \"Program Transcriptions\". These used a shallower and more closely spaced implementation of the large \"standard groove\" found on contemporary 78 rpm records, rather than the \"microgroove\" used for post-World War II 33\u2153 rpm \"[[LP record|LP]]\" (long play) records. The format was a commercial failure, partly because the new Victrolas with two-speed turntables designed to play these records were exorbitantly priced, the least expensive model retailing for $395.00 in the depths of the [[Great Depression]]. The format was abandoned by 1933, and two-speed turntables were no longer offered, but some Program Transcriptions lingered in the Victor record catalog until the end of the 1930s.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Edward |first1=David |title=RCA Program Transcription Album Discography (1931\u201333) |url=http://bsnpubs.com/rca/rca/rca33.html |website=bsnpubs.com |publisher=Both Sides Now Publications |accessdate=August 19, 2015 |display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\nDuring the early part of the Depression, RCA Victor made a number of attempts to create a successful cheap label to compete with the \"dime store labels\" ([[Perfect Records|Perfect]], [[Oriole Records (U.S.)|Oriole]], [[Banner Records|Banner]], [[Melotone Records (US)|Melotone]], etc.). The first was the short-lived \"Timely Tunes\" label in 1931 sold at Montgomery Ward. [[Bluebird Records]] was created in 1932 as a sub-label of RCA Victor. It was originally an 8-inch record with a dark blue label, alongside an 8-inch Electradisk label (sold at [[F. W. Woolworth Company|Woolworth]]'s). Neither were a success. In 1933, RCA Victor reintroduced Bluebird and Electradisk as a standard 10-inch label (Bluebird's label was redesigned, and it became known as the 'buff' label). Another cheap label, Sunrise, was produced (although nobody seems to know for whom it was produced, as Sunrise records are exceptionally rare today). The same musical couplings were issued on all three labels and the Bluebird label still survives today, eight decades after Electradisk and Sunrise were discontinued. RCA Victor also produced records for [[Montgomery Ward]] label during the 1930s.\n\nBesides manufacturing records for themselves, RCA Victor operated RCA Custom which was the leading record manufacturer for [[independent record label]]s.<ref>{{cite web |title=Quality Go Together at RCA Records |url=https://books.google.com/?id=NSEEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA26&lpg=PA26&dq=%22rca+custom%22%2B+leading#v=onepage&q=%22rca%20custom%22%2B%20leading&f=false |website=via Google |publisher=Billboard (archived ad) |accessdate=August 19, 2015 |date=October 6, 1958}}</ref> RCA Custom also pressed many record compilations for [[The Reader's Digest Association]].\n\nRCA sold its interest in EMI in 1935, but EMI continued to distribute RCA Victor recordings in the UK and its territories on the [[His Master's Voice|HMV]] label until the late 1950s. RCA also manufactured and distributed HMV recordings on the RCA Victor and custom HMV labels in North America.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ronpenndorf.com/labelography4.html |title=RCA Victor Red Seal Labelography (19501976) |first=Ron |last=Penndorf |work=RECOLLECTIONS: Fine Vintage LPs and Journal of Recorded Music |date= |accessdate=January 8, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111011131/http://ronpenndorf.com/labelography4.html |archivedate=January 11, 2012 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n===World War II era===\nDuring World War II, ties between RCA Victor and its Japanese affiliate [[JVC]] were severed. JVC's record company is known today as [[Victor Entertainment]] and still retains the [[Nipper]]/[[His Master's Voice]] trademark for use in Japan.\n\nFrom 1942 to 1944, RCA Victor was seriously impacted by the [[American Federation of Musicians]] [[1942\u201344 musicians' strike|recording ban]]. Virtually all union musicians in the US and Canada were forbidden from making recordings during the period. One of the few exceptions was the eventual release of recorded radio broadcast performances from the [[NBC Symphony Orchestra]] conducted by [[Arturo Toscanini]]. However, RCA Victor lost the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]] during this period; the orchestra's contract with RCA Victor expired during the strike and when [[Columbia Records]] settled with the union before RCA, [[Eugene Ormandy]] and the Philadelphians signed a new contract with Columbia and began recording in 1944. Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra would not return to RCA until 1968.\n\n===The post-war 1940s===\n[[File:Down Yonder.jpg|thumb|right|Standard RCA Victor 78 RPM label design from just after the end of [[World War II]] until 1954]]\nIn the spring of 1946, \"RCA Victor\" replaced \"Victor\" on labels for shellac 78 rpm singles. In 1949, RCA Victor introduced the 7-inch 45&nbsp;[[revolutions per minute|rpm]] micro-grooved [[vinylite]] record, marketed simply as the \"45\". The new format, which had been under development for several years, was originally intended to replace 78 rpm discs.<ref>Carson, B.H. et al. (1949) [http://www.aes.org/aeshc/docs/recording.technology.history/speed45.html \"A Record Changer and Record of Complementary Design\",] ''RCA Review'', June 1949, as reprinted by the Audio Engineering Society (retrieved January 5, 2013)</ref> By the time RCA Victor belatedly unveiled it, the 45 was now competing with the 10-inch and 12-inch 33\u2153&nbsp;rpm microgroove vinyl \"[[LP record|LP]]\" (Long Play) discs introduced by arch-rival [[Columbia Records]] in the early summer of 1948. In heavy promotion, RCA Victor sold compact, inexpensive add-on and stand-alone units that played the 45 rpm format exclusively. At first, RCA Victor's 45s were issued on colored vinyl according to the musical genre: contemporary pop music on black vinyl (47-XXXX series), prestigious Broadway musicals and operettas on \"midnight blue\" vinyl (52-xxxx series), classical music on red vinyl (49-xxxx series), country and polka on green (48-xxxx series), children's fare on yellow (also in the 47-xxxx series), rhythm and blues on orange or cerise (50-xxxx series), and international on light blue (51-xxxx series). This array of colors complicated the production process, and the practice was soon discontinued, all records becoming black. Yellow and red held on until about 1952. The first 45 rpm record manufactured was \"PeeWee the Piccolo\" RCA Victor 47-0147 pressed December 7, 1948 at the Sherman Avenue plant Indianapolis, R.O. Price, plant manager.<ref>Indiana State Museum document no. 71.2010.098.0001</ref> The use of vinyl, which was much more expensive than the gritty [[shellac]] compound normally used for 78s, was actually cheaper because of the smaller diameter and greatly reduced bulk of the new records, which required very little raw material. The smaller, lightweight discs were also more economical to store and ship.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Dawson, Jim and |first1=Propes, Steve |title=45 Rpm: The History, Heroes and Villains of a Pop Music Revolution |date=October 1, 2003 |publisher=Backbeat Books |isbn=0879307579 |page=37 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=AiA-6xfdqC0C&pg=PA24&dq=rca+45+rpm+record+player+1949#v=onepage&q=rca%2045%20rpm%20record%20player%201949&f=false |accessdate=August 19, 2015}}</ref>\n\nRCA Victor marketed the 45 as a direct replacement for 10-inch and 12-inch 78&nbsp;rpm records, which typically played for about three and four minutes per side respectively. The company also released some \"[[extended play]]\" (EP) 45s with playing times up to 7 minutes per side, primarily for some vocal collections and light classical selections, as typified by an [[Arthur Fiedler]] and the [[Boston Pops Orchestra]] disc featuring [[Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[Marche Slave]]'' and [[Ket\u00e8lbey]]'s ''[[In a Persian Market]]''. Boxed sets of four to six 45s were issued, each set providing about the same amount of music as one LP. (An extreme case of these boxed sets was the complete recording of the opera ''[[Carmen]]'', conducted by [[Fritz Reiner]], which consisted of sixteen 45 rpm discs.) In the case of operas, symphonies and other complete recordings of classical music, there was an interruption every four minutes as one record side ended and another was started up. These disruptive \"side breaks\", a nuisance long familiar to listeners of album sets of classical and operatic 78&nbsp;rpm records, were minimized by an extremely fast automatic record-changing mechanism that was a core feature of RCA Victor's 45 players. Thanks in large degree to RCA Victor's massive five million dollar advertising campaign, the 45 became the preferred speed for pop music singles, overtaking U.S. sales of the same material on 78s by 1954, but Columbia's LP prevailed as the format for classical music and convenient one-disc \"album\" collections of eight or more pop songs. RCA Victor finally bowed to the inevitable and announced its intention to issue LPs in January, 1950.\n\n===The 1950s===\nFinally acknowledging the success of Columbia's LP format and fearful of losing further market share, RCA Victor began issuing LPs itself.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.musicinthemail.com/audiohistoryLP.html |title=LPs historic |first=Edward |last=Wallerstein |publisher=Musicinthemail.com |date= |accessdate=January 8, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BUUEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA11 |title=Diskery Goes 33 in March To Service Entire Market; 45 Promotion in High Gear |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=January 7, 1950 |accessdate=January 8, 2012}}</ref> Among the first RCA Victor LPs released in 1950 was a performance of ''[[Ga\u00eet\u00e9 Parisienne]]'' by [[Jacques Offenbach]], played by [[Arthur Fiedler]] and the [[Boston Pops Orchestra]], which had actually been recorded in [[Boston]]'s [[Symphony Hall, Boston|Symphony Hall]] on June 20, 1947; it was given the catalogue number LM-1001. Non-classical albums were issued with the prefix \"LPM\". When RCA Victor later issued classical stereo albums (in 1958), they used the prefix \"LSC\". Non-classical stereo albums were issued with the prefix \"LSP\". RCA utilized these catalog prefixes until 1973.\n\nIn the 1950s, RCA Victor had three subsidiary or specialty labels: [[Groove Records|Groove]], [[Vik Recordings|Vik]] and \"X\".\n\nThe edition of ''Billboard'' magazine dated April 11, 1953, announced a new RCA Victor subsidiary label, its first to use independent distribution and was nameless when it was first revealed. For the lack of any better designation, Billboard chose to refer to the new, unnamed label in the story as Label \u201cX\u201d; the new label began to hire staffers and decide on a direction, and the name stuck until 1955. RCA Victor officially announced the formation of label \"X\" on April 20, 1953. Groove was an [[R&B]] specialty label founded in 1954 and folded into Vik in 1957;<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://home.earthlink.net/~v1tiger/labelX.html |title=Label \"X\" |year=2005 |first=JC |last=Marion |journal=Jamm Upp |volume=2 |issue=36}}</ref> the Vik label was discontinued the following year.\n\nThrough the 1940s and 1950s, RCA Victor was in intense competition with [[Columbia Records]]. A number of recordings were made with the [[NBC Symphony Orchestra]], conducted by [[Arturo Toscanini]]; sometimes RCA Victor utilized recordings of broadcast concerts (Toscanini had been recording for the label since the days of [[acoustic recording]]s, and RCA Victor had been recording the NBC Symphony since its creation in 1937). After Toscanini retired in the spring of 1954, the NBC Symphony was reorganized later that year as the [[Symphony of the Air]]. The orchestra, while no longer connected to NBC, continued to record for RCA Victor, as well as other labels, usually conducted by [[Leopold Stokowski]]. RCA Victor also released a number of recordings with the [[RCA Victor Symphony Orchestra]], which was usually drawn from either Philadelphia or New York musicians, as well as members of the Symphony of the Air, and the orchestra of the [[Metropolitan Opera]]. By the late 1950s, RCA Victor had fewer high prestige orchestras under contract than Columbia had: RCA Victor recorded the [[Chicago Symphony Orchestra]], the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]], and the Boston Pops, whereas Columbia had the [[Cleveland Orchestra]], the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]], and the [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra]] under contracts.\n\nOn October 6, 1953, RCA Victor held experimental stereophonic sessions in New York City's Manhattan Center with Leopold Stokowski conducting a group of New York City musicians in performances of [[George Enescu]]'s ''[[Romanian Rhapsodies (Enescu)#Rhapsody No. 1 in A major|Roumanian Rhapsody No. 1]]'' and the waltz from [[Tchaikovsky]]'s opera ''[[Eugene Onegin (opera)|Eugene Onegin]]''. There were additional stereo tests in December, again in the Manhattan Center, this time with [[Pierre Monteux]] conducting members of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. In February 1954, RCA Victor made its first commercial stereophonic recordings, taping the Boston Symphony Orchestra, conducted by [[Charles M\u00fcnch]], in a performance of ''The Damnation of Faust'' by Hector Berlioz. This began a practice of simultaneously recording orchestras with both stereophonic and monaural equipment. Other early stereo recordings were made of Toscanini's final NBC concerts (never officially issued) and [[Guido Cantelli]] respectively, with the NBC Symphony Orchestra; the Boston Pops Orchestra under Arthur Fiedler; and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under [[Fritz Reiner]]. Initially, RCA used RT-21 quarter-inch tape recorders (which ran at 30&nbsp;inches per second), wired to mono mixers, with Neumann U-47 cardioid and M-49/50 omnidirectional microphones. Then they switched to an Ampex 300\u20133 one-half inch machine, running at 15&nbsp;inches per second (which was later increased to 30&nbsp;inches per second). These recordings were initially issued in 1955 on special stereophonic reel-to-reel tapes and then, beginning in 1958, on vinyl LPs with the \"Living Stereo\" logo. RCA has continued to reissue many of these recordings on CD.<ref>''The History of Living Stereo'', RCA Victor liner notes</ref> Another 1953 project for RCA was converting the acoustically superior building [[Webster Hall]] into its main East Coast recording studio. RCA operated this studio venue from 1953 to 1968.\n\nIn September 1954, RCA Victor introduced \"Gruve-Gard\" where the center and edge of a record are thicker\nthan the playing area, reducing scuff marks during handling and when stacked on a turntable with an automatic record changer.<ref>{{cite web |first=Clint |last=Hough |url=http://www.sixtiescity.net/60trivia/60trivia.htm |title=Bringing on back the good times |publisher=Sixties City |date= |accessdate=January 8, 2012}}</ref> Most competitors quickly adopted the raised label and edges.\n\nIn 1955, RCA Victor purchased the recording contract of [[Elvis Presley]] from [[Sun Records]] for the then-astronomical sum of $35,000. Presley would become RCA Victor's biggest-selling recording artist. His first gold record was \"[[Heartbreak Hotel]]\", recorded in January 1956. RCA Victor would sell ten million Presley singles during 1956.\n\nRCA began making plans in 1955 to establish its own European presence issuing records on the RCA label.<ref name=\"Inc.1955\">{{cite book|author=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|title=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CyMEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT3|date=15 October 1955|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|pages=3\u2013|issn=0006-2510}}</ref>\n\nIn 1956, effective in 1957, RCA ended its 55-year association with EMI/HMV, after EMI's acquisition of [[Capitol Records]].<ref name=\"Inc.1956\">{{cite book |author=Nielsen Business Media, Inc. |title=Billboard |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8x4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA14 |date=17 March 1956 |publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc. |pages=14\u2013 |issn=0006-2510}}</ref><ref name=\"MartinHornsby1994\">{{cite book |author1=Sir George Martin |author2=Jeremy Hornsby |title=All You Need Is Ears: The Inside Personal Story of the Genius who Created The Beatles |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Yoio9MewhcC&pg=PA84 |date=15 October 1994 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |isbn=978-0-312-11482-4 |pages=84\u2013 }}</ref> Capitol then became the main distributor for EMI recordings in North and South America, with RCA Victor distributing its recordings through [[Decca Records]] in the United Kingdom on the RCA label, using the RCA lightning bolt logo, instead of the Nipper/His Master's Voice trademark for which EMI held the rights.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ipo.gov.uk/tm/t-find/t-find-number?detailsrequested=H&trademark=325592 |publisher=United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office |title=Trade Mark Details as at 13 November 2012: Case details for Trade Mark 325592 |date=September 7, 2009 |accessdate=November 13, 2012}}</ref> RCA set up its own British distribution in 1969.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=British RCA to Cut Decca Ltd.

In January 1961, the Compact 33 discs were released simultaneously with their 45 rpm counterparts. The long-term goal was to phase out the 45 rpm disc, but sales of the new records were poor and by early 1962 the campaign had failed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.megocollector.com/elvis-presley/33-rpm-7-elvis-presley/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-compact-33-record/ |title=The Rise and Fall of the Compact 33 Record |publisher=Megocollector.com |date= December 18, 2009|accessdate=January 8, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1963, RCA Victor introduced [[Dynagroove]] which added computer technology to the disc cutting process, ostensibly to improve sound reproduction. Whether it was actually an improvement or not is still debated among audiophiles. RCA quietly discontinued Dynagroove around 1970.\n\nIn September 1965, RCA and [[Learjet|Lear Jet Corp.]] teamed up to release the first stereo 8-track tape music Cartridges ([[Stereo 8]]) which were first used in the 1966 line of [[Ford]] automobiles and were popular throughout the late 1960s and 1970s. (The initial release comprised 175 titles from RCA Victor and RCA Camden's catalog of artists.)\n\nIn 1968, the [[RCA Corporation]] modernized its image with what was then a new futuristic-looking logo (the letters RCA in block modernized form), replacing the old lightning bolt logo, and the virtual retirement of both the Victor and Nipper/His Master's Voice trademarks. The RCA Victor Division was now known as RCA Records, \"Victor\" now restricted to the album covers and labels of RCA's regular popular record releases, while the Nipper trademark was seen only on the album covers of [[RCA Red Seal Records|Red Seal]] records. The color of the labels, which had always been black for the popular series (as opposed to the Red Seal line), was changed to a bright orange or yellow (becoming tan briefly later in 1975\u201376).\n\nIn late 1969, RCA Records introduced a very thin, lightweight vinyl LP known as [[Dynaflex (RCA)|Dynaflex]]. This type of pressing claimed to overcome warping and other problems in conventional thicker pressings, but it had a controversial reputation in the industry and was abandoned by the late 1970s.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Belam |first1=Martin |title=Dynaflex \u2013 RCA's 1970s ultra-thin vinyl |url=http://www.currybet.net/cbet_blog/2008/01/dynaflex---rcas-1970s-ultra-th.php |website=www.currybet.net |publisher=Martin Belam |accessdate=September 9, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===The 1970s===\n[[File:RCA Records, Harry Nilsson - Nilsson Schmilsson.jpg|thumb|right|Platinum record of album ''[[Nilsson Schmilsson]]'', featuring the 1968\u201375 Orange RCA Victor label]]\nIn April 1970, RCA announced the first [[quadraphonic]] 4-channel 8-track tape cartridges (\"Quad-8\", later called just Q8). RCA Records began releasing quadraphonic vinyl recordings in the United States in February 1973, in the CD-4 format developed by its former subsidiary Japan Victor Corporation (JVC), and made commercially practical by Quadracast Systems Inc. (QSI). RCA's trade name became \"Quadradisc\". The CD-4 format required a special cartridge that had a \u00b11&nbsp;db frequency response out to 50&nbsp;kHz, a CD-4 demodulator which decoded the difference between the front and rear channels from a 30&nbsp;kHz subcarrier, four separate amplifier channels, and four separate speakers for the left and right front and left and right rear. Both the CD-4 Quadradisc and Quad-8 tape cartridge systems were true discrete 4\u20134\u20134 quadraphonic systems. Columbia introduced a quadraphonic matrix system, SQ, which required a decoder, 4-channel amplifier and the four speakers. The SQ system was referred to as a 4\u20132\u20134 matrix system. The [[Warner Music Group]] labels also adopted Quadradisc, but the format never became popular, and both RCA and Columbia abandoned quadraphonic recording by 1976; some of the RCA sessions were later remastered for [[matrix decoder#Dolby MP matrix encoding (2:4)|Dolby encoding]] (same as [[Peter Scheiber]]'s original matrix system) and released on CD. This included [[Charles Gerhardt (conductor)|Charles Gerhardt]]'s acclaimed series of RCA Red Seal albums devoted to classic film scores by [[Erich Wolfgang Korngold]], [[Alfred Newman (composer)|Alfred Newman]], [[Dimitri Tiomkin]], [[Max Steiner]], [[Franz Waxman]], and others, performed by the [[National Philharmonic Orchestra]] in London's [[Kingsway Hall]].\n\nBeginning in late 1976, the RCA Corporation revived the Nipper/His Master's Voice trademark. RCA Records reinstated Nipper to most (Victor, [[RCA Victrola|Victrola]], [[RCA Red Seal|Red Seal]] and Special Products) record labels (in addition to returning to the traditional black label color for popular releases) in countries where RCA held the rights to the Nipper/His Master's Voice trademark. Nipper was once again widely used in RCA newspaper and magazine advertisements as well as store displays and promotional items such as [[T-shirts]], posters, watches, coffee mugs and stuffed toys. The trademark was also painted on RCA delivery and service trucks.\n\n===The 1980s===\nIn 1983, [[Arista Records]] owner [[Bertelsmann]] sold 50% of Arista to RCA. In 1985, Bertelsmann and RCA Records formed a joint venture called RCA/Ariola International.<ref name=\"bertelsmann.com\">{{citation |url=http://www.bertelsmann.com/bertelsmann_corp/wms41/customers/bmcorp/pdf/RCA_-_Now_Elvis_rocked_for_Bertelsmann__too.pdf |title=RCA: Now Elvis rocked for Bertelsmann, too |publisher=Bertelsmann Worldwide Media}}</ref> The following year, RCA Corporation was acquired by [[General Electric]] (GE) and it sold its 50% interest in RCA Records to its partner Bertelsmann.

BMG also revived the \"RCA Victor\" label for Red Seal, Broadway and soundtrack releases and other musical genres outside of rock, pop and country music. In 1986, Bob Buziak, formerly an artist manager, was appointed president of the label.\n\nDuring the mid-1980s, RCA Records operated at a deficit, due in part to \"overpriced deals\" with pop stars including [[Kenny Rogers]] and [[Diana Ross]]. In 1986, the label bought back $25 million in unsold albums and lost $35 million during the fiscal year 1987. As a partial corrective, a decentralized style of management which allowed RCA Records to function as a free-standing entrepreneurial business was implemented for 1988. Buziak drastically cut the RCA roster from around 40 acts to 11, and began to rebuild it with a focus on developing artists, including artists acquired through marketing and distribution agreements with [[Beggars Banquet Records]] and [[Jive Records]], whose roster included [[Schooly D]], [[Kool Moe Dee]], and [[DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince]].\n\nBy the end of the fiscal year 1988, RCA Records had gross revenue of $236 million in the United States, its most profitable year to date. [[Bruce Hornsby]]'s ''[[The Way It Is (Bruce Hornsby album)|The Way It Is]]'' sold more than three million albums, and the [[Dirty Dancing (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] for the film ''[[Dirty Dancing]]'', which cost RCA $200,000 to produce, sold 15.6 million copies in less than two years. Its follow-up, ''[[More Dirty Dancing]]'', composed of song tracks which had been left out of the first album, was produced for $80,000 and went on to sell more than 5.6 million. Among the most successful acts for RCA Records during the 1980s were the [[Eurythmics]], [[Love and Rockets (band)|Love and Rockets]], [[Joshua Perahia]], [[Rick Astley]] and [[Bucks Fizz]].<ref name=\"LA Times 1980s\">{{cite news |last1=Knoedelselder, Jr. |first1=William |title=Rap On RCA Records: The Original U.S. Record Company Is Back In Groove |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-09-18/business/fi-3214_1_rca-records |accessdate=August 14, 2015 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=September 18, 1998}}</ref><ref name=\"RCA Hit Men\">{{cite book |last1=Dannen |first1=Frederic |title=Hit Men: Power Brokers and Fast Money Inside the Music Business |date=July 2, 1991 |publisher=Random House |location=New York |isbn=9780679730613 |page=260 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Oa97Z7pOWPYC&pg=PA260&lpg=PA260&dq=Bob+Buziak++President+of+RCA+Records+US+1986#v=onepage&q=Bob%20Buziak%20%20President%20of%20RCA%20Records%20US%201986&f=false |accessdate=August 14, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===The 1990s===\nIn August 1990 Buziak was replaced by [[Joe Galante]], who had been the president of RCA Records Nashville division.

(musical)|Hello, Dolly!]]'', ''[[Oliver!]]'', and ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]''. RCA has also recorded and released recordings of revival stagings of musicals. These include the musical productions staged at [[Lincoln Center]], such as the 1966 revivals of ''[[Show Boat]]'' and ''[[Annie Get Your Gun (musical)|Annie Get Your Gun]]'', the 1987 revival of ''[[Anything Goes]]'' and the 1998 Broadway revivals of ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]'' and ''[[The Sound of Music]]''. ''[[Call Me Madam]]'' was recorded by RCA Victor with all of its original cast except for its star [[Ethel Merman]], who, due to contractual obligations, could not be released from her American [[Decca Records]] contract. She was replaced on the RCA Victor album by [[Dinah Shore]]. RCA Victor was also responsible for the [[film soundtrack]] albums of ''Damn Yankees'', ''[[South Pacific (1958 film)|South Pacific]]'', ''[[Bye Bye Birdie (film)|Bye Bye Birdie]]'', ''[[Half a Sixpence (film)|Half a Sixpence]]'', and ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]''. The album made from the 1965 hit [[Julie Andrews]] film was (and is) one of the best selling soundtracks of all time. The film soundtrack of ''[[Oliver! (film)|Oliver!]]'', made by [[Colgems Records]], was distributed by RCA, which had released the Broadway cast album. RCA Victor also released the original American cast album of ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]''.\n\nSimilarly, RCA Victor also made several [[Studio recording|studio cast recording]] albums, including a [[Lerner and Loewe]] series with [[Jan Peerce]], [[Jane Powell]], and [[Robert Merrill]], as well as a 1963 album of excerpts from [[George Gershwin]]'s ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'', with its 1952 revival leads, [[Leontyne Price]] and [[William Warfield]], but a different supporting cast. They also issued two studio cast versions of ''Show Boat'', one with Robert Merrill, [[Patrice Munsel]], and [[Rise Stevens]] in 1956, and the other with [[Howard Keel]], [[Anne Jeffreys]], and [[Gogi Grant]] in 1958. Unfortunately, contrary to the way the show is written, both of these ''Show Boat'' albums featured all-white casts, reflecting the era of racial segregation.\n\nIn 2006, Sony BMG merged its Broadway music labels, including RCA Victor, to the new [[Masterworks Broadway Records]]. All of these recordings are now on [[Masterworks Broadway Records]], which has remastered and reissued many of these albums.\n\n==Criticism and controversies==\n===Kelly Clarkson===\nIn the summer of 2007, [[Kelly Clarkson]] and Clive Davis, then head of [[Sony BMG]], feuded publicly regarding the direction of her album ''[[My December]]'', the follow-up to Clarkson's multi-platinum album, ''[[Breakaway (Kelly Clarkson album)|Breakaway]]''. Clarkson wrote the songs on ''My December'', \"showcasing her own songwriting on darker, edgier rock-oriented fare\", and Davis insisted Clarkson work with hired hitmakers, as she had previously, on \"polished, radio-friendly songs\". Clarkson refused to change the album, and it was released in June 2007. It has since been certified platinum.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Newman |first=Melinda |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6524077/kelly-clarkson-worth-american-idol-contract |title=Now Free From Her Idol Contract, What's Kelly Clarkson Worth? |magazine=Billboard |date=April 3, 2015 |accessdate=August 8, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Benjamin |first=Jeff |url=http://www.fuse.tv/2015/03/kelly-clarkson-kept-it-so-real-best-moments |title=9 Times Kelly Clarkson Kept it Real |publisher=Fuse |date=March 3, 2015 |accessdate=August 8, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Du Lac |first1=J.

By the mid-to-late 1920s, Victor had signed [[Jelly Roll Morton]], [[Bennie Moten]], [[Duke Ellington]] and other black bands, and was becoming very competitive with Columbia and Brunswick, even starting their own V-38000 \"Hot Dance\" series that was marketed to all Victor dealers. They also had a V-38500 \"race\" ([[race records]]) series, a 23000 'hot dance' continuation of the V-38000 series, as well as a 23200 'Race' series with blues, gospel and some hard jazz. However, throughout the 1930s, Victor's involvement in jazz and blues slowed down and by the time of the musicians' strike and the end of the war, Victor was neglecting the R&B (race) scene, which is one of the reasons so many independent companies sprang up so successfully.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.elvispresleymuseum.com/RCA_Victor.html |title=RCA Victor |work=elvispresleymuseum |access-date=May 2, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 1960s, Victor decided to demolish its [[Camden, New Jersey|Camden]] warehouse.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rateyourmusic.com/label/rca_victor |title=Label: RCA Victor |publisher=RateyourMusic.com}}</ref> This warehouse reportedly held four floors' worth of catalog and vault masters (most of them were pre-tape wax and metal discs), test pressings, lacquer discs, matrix ledgers, and rehearsal recordings. The company retained some of the more important masters (such as those by [[Enrico Caruso]]; why [[Rachmaninoff]]'s apparently weren't saved is a mystery), but it is uncertain just how many others were saved or lost. A few days before the demolition took place, some collectors from the US and Europe were allowed to go through the warehouse and salvage whatever they could carry with them for their personal collections. Soon afterward, record collectors and RCA Victor officials watched from a nearby bridge as the warehouse was dynamited, with many studio masters still intact in the building. The remnants were bulldozed into the Delaware River and a pier was built on top of them. In 1973, to celebrate the centenary of Rachmaninoff's birth, RCA decided to reissue his complete recordings on LP; RCA was forced to go to collectors for copies of certain records because their archives were incomplete, as documented in a ''Time'' magazine article.\n\n==Other RCA labels==\n*RCA Records (UK): A division of [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony Music UK]], since 2006, which acts as an import label of American and multinational [[Sony Music]] artists, and also signs UK and Irish artists, including [[Paloma Faith]], [[Everything Everything]], [[Laura Mvula]], [[Little Mix]], [[Olly Murs]], and [[Kodaline]].\n*[[RCA Red Seal Records]]: The RCA Red Seal [[European Classical Music|classical music]] label is now part of [[Sony Masterworks]].\n*RCA Records (France): A division of [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony Music France]].

The format was a commercial failure, partly because the new Victrolas with two-speed turntables designed to play these records were exorbitantly priced, the least expensive model retailing for $395.00 in the depths of the [[Great Depression]]. The format was abandoned by 1933, and two-speed turntables were no longer offered, but some Program Transcriptions lingered in the Victor record catalog until the end of the 1930s.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Edward |first1=David |title=RCA Program Transcription Album Discography (1931\u201333) |url=http://bsnpubs.com/rca/rca/rca33.html |website=bsnpubs.com |publisher=Both Sides Now Publications |accessdate=August 19, 2015 |display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\nDuring the early part of the Depression, RCA Victor made a number of attempts to create a successful cheap label to compete with the \"dime store labels\" ([[Perfect Records|Perfect]], [[Oriole Records (U.S.)|Oriole]], [[Banner Records|Banner]], [[Melotone Records (US)|Melotone]], etc.). The first was the short-lived \"Timely Tunes\" label in 1931 sold at Montgomery Ward. [[Bluebird Records]] was created in 1932 as a sub-label of RCA Victor. It was originally an 8-inch record with a dark blue label, alongside an 8-inch Electradisk label (sold at [[F. W. Woolworth Company|Woolworth]]'s). Neither were a success. In 1933, RCA Victor reintroduced Bluebird and Electradisk as a standard 10-inch label (Bluebird's label was redesigned, and it became known as the 'buff' label). Another cheap label, Sunrise, was produced (although nobody seems to know for whom it was produced, as Sunrise records are exceptionally rare today). The same musical couplings were issued on all three labels and the Bluebird label still survives today, eight decades after Electradisk and Sunrise were discontinued. RCA Victor also produced records for [[Montgomery Ward]] label during the 1930s.\n\nBesides manufacturing records for themselves, RCA Victor operated RCA Custom which was the leading record manufacturer for [[independent record label]]s.<ref>{{cite web |title=Quality Go Together at RCA Records |url=https://books.google.com/?id=NSEEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA26&lpg=PA26&dq=%22rca+custom%22%2B+leading#v=onepage&q=%22rca%20custom%22%2B%20leading&f=false |website=via Google |publisher=Billboard (archived ad) |accessdate=August 19, 2015 |date=October 6, 1958}}</ref> RCA Custom also pressed many record compilations for [[The Reader's Digest Association]].\n\nRCA sold its interest in EMI in 1935, but EMI continued to distribute RCA Victor recordings in the UK and its territories on the [[His Master's Voice|HMV]] label until the late 1950s. RCA also manufactured and distributed HMV recordings on the RCA Victor and custom HMV labels in North America.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ronpenndorf.com/labelography4.html |title=RCA Victor Red Seal Labelography (19501976) |first=Ron |last=Penndorf |work=RECOLLECTIONS: Fine Vintage LPs and Journal of Recorded Music |date= |accessdate=January 8, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111011131/http://ronpenndorf.com/labelography4.html |archivedate=January 11, 2012 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n===World War II era===\nDuring World War II, ties between RCA Victor and its Japanese affiliate [[JVC]] were severed. JVC's record company is known today as [[Victor Entertainment]] and still retains the [[Nipper]]/[[His Master's Voice]] trademark for use in Japan.\n\nFrom 1942 to 1944, RCA Victor was seriously impacted by the [[American Federation of Musicians]] [[1942\u201344 musicians' strike|recording ban]]. Virtually all union musicians in the US and Canada were forbidden from making recordings during the period. One of the few exceptions was the eventual release of recorded radio broadcast performances from the [[NBC Symphony Orchestra]] conducted by [[Arturo Toscanini]]. However, RCA Victor lost the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]] during this period; the orchestra's contract with RCA Victor expired during the strike and when [[Columbia Records]] settled with the union before RCA, [[Eugene Ormandy]] and the Philadelphians signed a new contract with Columbia and began recording in 1944. Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra would not return to RCA until 1968.\n\n===The post-war 1940s===\n[[File:Down Yonder.jpg|thumb|right|Standard RCA Victor 78 RPM label design from just after the end of [[World War II]] until 1954]]\nIn the spring of 1946, \"RCA Victor\" replaced \"Victor\" on labels for shellac 78 rpm singles. In 1949, RCA Victor introduced the 7-inch 45&nbsp;[[revolutions per minute|rpm]] micro-grooved [[vinylite]] record, marketed simply as the \"45\". The new format, which had been under development for several years, was originally intended to replace 78 rpm discs.<ref>Carson, B.H. et al. (1949) [http://www.aes.org/aeshc/docs/recording.technology.history/speed45.html \"A Record Changer and Record of Complementary Design\",] ''RCA Review'', June 1949, as reprinted by the Audio Engineering Society (retrieved January 5, 2013)</ref> By the time RCA Victor belatedly unveiled it, the 45 was now competing with the 10-inch and 12-inch 33\u2153&nbsp;rpm microgroove vinyl \"[[LP record|LP]]\" (Long Play) discs introduced by arch-rival [[Columbia Records]] in the early summer of 1948. In heavy promotion, RCA Victor sold compact, inexpensive add-on and stand-alone units that played the 45 rpm format exclusively. At first, RCA Victor's 45s were issued on colored vinyl according to the musical genre: contemporary pop music on black vinyl (47-XXXX series), prestigious Broadway musicals and operettas on \"midnight blue\" vinyl (52-xxxx series), classical music on red vinyl (49-xxxx series), country and polka on green (48-xxxx series), children's fare on yellow (also in the 47-xxxx series), rhythm and blues on orange or cerise (50-xxxx series), and international on light blue (51-xxxx series). This array of colors complicated the production process, and the practice was soon discontinued, all records becoming black. Yellow and red held on until about 1952. The first 45 rpm record manufactured was \"PeeWee the Piccolo\" RCA Victor 47-0147 pressed December 7, 1948 at the Sherman Avenue plant Indianapolis, R.O. Price, plant manager.<ref>Indiana State Museum document no. 71.2010.098.0001</ref> The use of vinyl, which was much more expensive than the gritty [[shellac]] compound normally used for 78s, was actually cheaper because of the smaller diameter and greatly reduced bulk of the new records, which required very little raw material. The smaller, lightweight discs were also more economical to store and ship.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Dawson, Jim and |first1=Propes, Steve |title=45 Rpm: The History, Heroes and Villains of a Pop Music Revolution |date=October 1, 2003 |publisher=Backbeat Books |isbn=0879307579 |page=37 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=AiA-6xfdqC0C&pg=PA24&dq=rca+45+rpm+record+player+1949#v=onepage&q=rca%2045%20rpm%20record%20player%201949&f=false |accessdate=August 19, 2015}}</ref>\n\nRCA Victor marketed the 45 as a direct replacement for 10-inch and 12-inch 78&nbsp;rpm records, which typically played for about three and four minutes per side respectively. The company also released some \"[[extended play]]\" (EP) 45s with playing times up to 7 minutes per side, primarily for some vocal collections and light classical selections, as typified by an [[Arthur Fiedler]] and the [[Boston Pops Orchestra]] disc featuring [[Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[Marche Slave]]'' and [[Ket\u00e8lbey]]'s ''[[In a Persian Market]]''. Boxed sets of four to six 45s were issued, each set providing about the same amount of music as one LP. (An extreme case of these boxed sets was the complete recording of the opera ''[[Carmen]]'', conducted by [[Fritz Reiner]], which consisted of sixteen 45 rpm discs.) In the case of operas, symphonies and other complete recordings of classical music, there was an interruption every four minutes as one record side ended and another was started up. These disruptive \"side breaks\", a nuisance long familiar to listeners of album sets of classical and operatic 78&nbsp;rpm records, were minimized by an extremely fast automatic record-changing mechanism that was a core feature of RCA Victor's 45 players. Thanks in large degree to RCA Victor's massive five million dollar advertising campaign, the 45 became the preferred speed for pop music singles, overtaking U.S. sales of the same material on 78s by 1954, but Columbia's LP prevailed as the format for classical music and convenient one-disc \"album\" collections of eight or more pop songs. RCA Victor finally bowed to the inevitable and announced its intention to issue LPs in January, 1950.\n\n===The 1950s===\nFinally acknowledging the success of Columbia's LP format and fearful of losing further market share, RCA Victor began issuing LPs itself.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.musicinthemail.com/audiohistoryLP.html |title=LPs historic |first=Edward |last=Wallerstein |publisher=Musicinthemail.com |date= |accessdate=January 8, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BUUEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA11 |title=Diskery Goes 33 in March To Service Entire Market; 45 Promotion in High Gear |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=January 7, 1950 |accessdate=January 8, 2012}}</ref> Among the first RCA Victor LPs released in 1950 was a performance of ''[[Ga\u00eet\u00e9 Parisienne]]'' by [[Jacques Offenbach]], played by [[Arthur Fiedler]] and the [[Boston Pops Orchestra]], which had actually been recorded in [[Boston]]'s [[Symphony Hall, Boston|Symphony Hall]] on June 20, 1947; it was given the catalogue number LM-1001. Non-classical albums were issued with the prefix \"LPM\". When RCA Victor later issued classical stereo albums (in 1958), they used the prefix \"LSC\". Non-classical stereo albums were issued with the prefix \"LSP\". RCA utilized these catalog prefixes until 1973.\n\nIn the 1950s, RCA Victor had three subsidiary or specialty labels: [[Groove Records|Groove]], [[Vik Recordings|Vik]] and \"X\".\n\nThe edition of ''Billboard'' magazine dated April 11, 1953, announced a new RCA Victor subsidiary label, its first to use independent distribution and was nameless when it was first revealed. For the lack of any better designation, Billboard chose to refer to the new, unnamed label in the story as Label \u201cX\u201d; the new label began to hire staffers and decide on a direction, and the name stuck until 1955. RCA Victor officially announced the formation of label \"X\" on April 20, 1953. Groove was an [[R&B]] specialty label founded in 1954 and folded into Vik in 1957;<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://home.earthlink.net/~v1tiger/labelX.html |title=Label \"X\" |year=2005 |first=JC |last=Marion |journal=Jamm Upp |volume=2 |issue=36}}</ref> the Vik label was discontinued the following year.\n\nThrough the 1940s and 1950s, RCA Victor was in intense competition with [[Columbia Records]]. A number of recordings were made with the [[NBC Symphony Orchestra]], conducted by [[Arturo Toscanini]]; sometimes RCA Victor utilized recordings of broadcast concerts (Toscanini had been recording for the label since the days of [[acoustic recording]]s, and RCA Victor had been recording the NBC Symphony since its creation in 1937). After Toscanini retired in the spring of 1954, the NBC Symphony was reorganized later that year as the [[Symphony of the Air]]. The orchestra, while no longer connected to NBC, continued to record for RCA Victor, as well as other labels, usually conducted by [[Leopold Stokowski]]. RCA Victor also released a number of recordings with the [[RCA Victor Symphony Orchestra]], which was usually drawn from either Philadelphia or New York musicians, as well as members of the Symphony of the Air, and the orchestra of the [[Metropolitan Opera]]. By the late 1950s, RCA Victor had fewer high prestige orchestras under contract than Columbia had: RCA Victor recorded the [[Chicago Symphony Orchestra]], the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]], and the Boston Pops, whereas Columbia had the [[Cleveland Orchestra]], the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]], and the [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra]] under contracts.\n\nOn October 6, 1953, RCA Victor held experimental stereophonic sessions in New York City's Manhattan Center with Leopold Stokowski conducting a group of New York City musicians in performances of [[George Enescu]]'s ''[[Romanian Rhapsodies (Enescu)#Rhapsody No. 1 in A major|Roumanian Rhapsody No. 1]]'' and the waltz from [[Tchaikovsky]]'s opera ''[[Eugene Onegin (opera)|Eugene Onegin]]''. There were additional stereo tests in December, again in the Manhattan Center, this time with [[Pierre Monteux]] conducting members of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. In February 1954, RCA Victor made its first commercial stereophonic recordings, taping the Boston Symphony Orchestra, conducted by [[Charles M\u00fcnch]], in a performance of ''The Damnation of Faust'' by Hector Berlioz. This began a practice of simultaneously recording orchestras with both stereophonic and monaural equipment. Other early stereo recordings were made of Toscanini's final NBC concerts (never officially issued) and [[Guido Cantelli]] respectively, with the NBC Symphony Orchestra; the Boston Pops Orchestra under Arthur Fiedler; and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under [[Fritz Reiner]]. Initially, RCA used RT-21 quarter-inch tape recorders (which ran at 30&nbsp;inches per second), wired to mono mixers, with Neumann U-47 cardioid and M-49/50 omnidirectional microphones. Then they switched to an Ampex 300\u20133 one-half inch machine, running at 15&nbsp;inches per second (which was later increased to 30&nbsp;inches per second). These recordings were initially issued in 1955 on special stereophonic reel-to-reel tapes and then, beginning in 1958, on vinyl LPs with the \"Living Stereo\" logo. RCA has continued to reissue many of these recordings on CD.<ref>''The History of Living Stereo'', RCA Victor liner notes</ref> Another 1953 project for RCA was converting the acoustically superior building [[Webster Hall]] into its main East Coast recording studio. RCA operated this studio venue from 1953 to 1968.\n\nIn September 1954, RCA Victor introduced \"Gruve-Gard\" where the center and edge of a record are thicker\nthan the playing area, reducing scuff marks during handling and when stacked on a turntable with an automatic record changer.<ref>{{cite web |first=Clint |last=Hough |url=http://www.sixtiescity.net/60trivia/60trivia.htm |title=Bringing on back the good times |publisher=Sixties City |date= |accessdate=January 8, 2012}}</ref> Most competitors quickly adopted the raised label and edges.\n\nIn 1955, RCA Victor purchased the recording contract of [[Elvis Presley]] from [[Sun Records]] for the then-astronomical sum of $35,000. Presley would become RCA Victor's biggest-selling recording artist. His first gold record was \"[[Heartbreak Hotel]]\", recorded in January 1956. RCA Victor would sell ten million Presley singles during 1956.\n\nRCA began making plans in 1955 to establish its own European presence issuing records on the RCA label.<ref name=\"Inc.1955\">{{cite book|author=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|title=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CyMEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT3|date=15 October 1955|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|pages=3\u2013|issn=0006-2510}}</ref>\n\nIn 1956, effective in 1957, RCA ended its 55-year association with EMI/HMV, after EMI's acquisition of [[Capitol Records]].<ref name=\"Inc.1956\">{{cite book |author=Nielsen Business Media, Inc. |title=Billboard |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8x4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA14 |date=17 March 1956 |publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc. |pages=14\u2013 |issn=0006-2510}}</ref><ref name=\"MartinHornsby1994\">{{cite book |author1=Sir George Martin |author2=Jeremy Hornsby |title=All You Need Is Ears: The Inside Personal Story of the Genius who Created The Beatles |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Yoio9MewhcC&pg=PA84 |date=15 October 1994 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |isbn=978-0-312-11482-4 |pages=84\u2013 }}</ref> Capitol then became the main distributor for EMI recordings in North and South America, with RCA Victor distributing its recordings through [[Decca Records]] in the United Kingdom on the RCA label, using the RCA lightning bolt logo, instead of the Nipper/His Master's Voice trademark for which EMI held the rights.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ipo.gov.uk/tm/t-find/t-find-number?detailsrequested=H&trademark=325592 |publisher=United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office |title=Trade Mark Details as at 13 November 2012: Case details for Trade Mark 325592 |date=September 7, 2009 |accessdate=November 13, 2012}}</ref> RCA set up its own British distribution in 1969.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=British RCA to Cut Decca Ltd.

In January 1961, the Compact 33 discs were released simultaneously with their 45 rpm counterparts. The long-term goal was to phase out the 45 rpm disc, but sales of the new records were poor and by early 1962 the campaign had failed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.megocollector.com/elvis-presley/33-rpm-7-elvis-presley/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-compact-33-record/ |title=The Rise and Fall of the Compact 33 Record |publisher=Megocollector.com |date= December 18, 2009|accessdate=January 8, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1963, RCA Victor introduced [[Dynagroove]] which added computer technology to the disc cutting process, ostensibly to improve sound reproduction. Whether it was actually an improvement or not is still debated among audiophiles. RCA quietly discontinued Dynagroove around 1970.\n\nIn September 1965, RCA and [[Learjet|Lear Jet Corp.]] teamed up to release the first stereo 8-track tape music Cartridges ([[Stereo 8]]) which were first used in the 1966 line of [[Ford]] automobiles and were popular throughout the late 1960s and 1970s. (The initial release comprised 175 titles from RCA Victor and RCA Camden's catalog of artists.)\n\nIn 1968, the [[RCA Corporation]] modernized its image with what was then a new futuristic-looking logo (the letters RCA in block modernized form), replacing the old lightning bolt logo, and the virtual retirement of both the Victor and Nipper/His Master's Voice trademarks. The RCA Victor Division was now known as RCA Records, \"Victor\" now restricted to the album covers and labels of RCA's regular popular record releases, while the Nipper trademark was seen only on the album covers of [[RCA Red Seal Records|Red Seal]] records. The color of the labels, which had always been black for the popular series (as opposed to the Red Seal line), was changed to a bright orange or yellow (becoming tan briefly later in 1975\u201376).\n\nIn late 1969, RCA Records introduced a very thin, lightweight vinyl LP known as [[Dynaflex (RCA)|Dynaflex]]. This type of pressing claimed to overcome warping and other problems in conventional thicker pressings, but it had a controversial reputation in the industry and was abandoned by the late 1970s.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Belam |first1=Martin |title=Dynaflex \u2013 RCA's 1970s ultra-thin vinyl |url=http://www.currybet.net/cbet_blog/2008/01/dynaflex---rcas-1970s-ultra-th.php |website=www.currybet.net |publisher=Martin Belam |accessdate=September 9, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===The 1970s===\n[[File:RCA Records, Harry Nilsson - Nilsson Schmilsson.jpg|thumb|right|Platinum record of album ''[[Nilsson Schmilsson]]'', featuring the 1968\u201375 Orange RCA Victor label]]\nIn April 1970, RCA announced the first [[quadraphonic]] 4-channel 8-track tape cartridges (\"Quad-8\", later called just Q8). RCA Records began releasing quadraphonic vinyl recordings in the United States in February 1973, in the CD-4 format developed by its former subsidiary Japan Victor Corporation (JVC), and made commercially practical by Quadracast Systems Inc. (QSI). RCA's trade name became \"Quadradisc\". The CD-4 format required a special cartridge that had a \u00b11&nbsp;db frequency response out to 50&nbsp;kHz, a CD-4 demodulator which decoded the difference between the front and rear channels from a 30&nbsp;kHz subcarrier, four separate amplifier channels, and four separate speakers for the left and right front and left and right rear. Both the CD-4 Quadradisc and Quad-8 tape cartridge systems were true discrete 4\u20134\u20134 quadraphonic systems. Columbia introduced a quadraphonic matrix system, SQ, which required a decoder, 4-channel amplifier and the four speakers. The SQ system was referred to as a 4\u20132\u20134 matrix system. The [[Warner Music Group]] labels also adopted Quadradisc, but the format never became popular, and both RCA and Columbia abandoned quadraphonic recording by 1976; some of the RCA sessions were later remastered for [[matrix decoder#Dolby MP matrix encoding (2:4)|Dolby encoding]] (same as [[Peter Scheiber]]'s original matrix system) and released on CD. This included [[Charles Gerhardt (conductor)|Charles Gerhardt]]'s acclaimed series of RCA Red Seal albums devoted to classic film scores by [[Erich Wolfgang Korngold]], [[Alfred Newman (composer)|Alfred Newman]], [[Dimitri Tiomkin]], [[Max Steiner]], [[Franz Waxman]], and others, performed by the [[National Philharmonic Orchestra]] in London's [[Kingsway Hall]].\n\nBeginning in late 1976, the RCA Corporation revived the Nipper/His Master's Voice trademark. RCA Records reinstated Nipper to most (Victor, [[RCA Victrola|Victrola]], [[RCA Red Seal|Red Seal]] and Special Products) record labels (in addition to returning to the traditional black label color for popular releases) in countries where RCA held the rights to the Nipper/His Master's Voice trademark. Nipper was once again widely used in RCA newspaper and magazine advertisements as well as store displays and promotional items such as [[T-shirts]], posters, watches, coffee mugs and stuffed toys. The trademark was also painted on RCA delivery and service trucks.\n\n===The 1980s===\nIn 1983, [[Arista Records]] owner [[Bertelsmann]] sold 50% of Arista to RCA. In 1985, Bertelsmann and RCA Records formed a joint venture called RCA/Ariola International.<ref name=\"bertelsmann.com\">{{citation |url=http://www.bertelsmann.com/bertelsmann_corp/wms41/customers/bmcorp/pdf/RCA_-_Now_Elvis_rocked_for_Bertelsmann__too.pdf |title=RCA: Now Elvis rocked for Bertelsmann, too |publisher=Bertelsmann Worldwide Media}}</ref> The following year, RCA Corporation was acquired by [[General Electric]] (GE) and it sold its 50% interest in RCA Records to its partner Bertelsmann.

BMG also revived the \"RCA Victor\" label for Red Seal, Broadway and soundtrack releases and other musical genres outside of rock, pop and country music. In 1986, Bob Buziak, formerly an artist manager, was appointed president of the label.\n\nDuring the mid-1980s, RCA Records operated at a deficit, due in part to \"overpriced deals\" with pop stars including [[Kenny Rogers]] and [[Diana Ross]]. In 1986, the label bought back $25 million in unsold albums and lost $35 million during the fiscal year 1987. As a partial corrective, a decentralized style of management which allowed RCA Records to function as a free-standing entrepreneurial business was implemented for 1988. Buziak drastically cut the RCA roster from around 40 acts to 11, and began to rebuild it with a focus on developing artists, including artists acquired through marketing and distribution agreements with [[Beggars Banquet Records]] and [[Jive Records]], whose roster included [[Schooly D]], [[Kool Moe Dee]], and [[DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince]].\n\nBy the end of the fiscal year 1988, RCA Records had gross revenue of $236 million in the United States, its most profitable year to date. [[Bruce Hornsby]]'s ''[[The Way It Is (Bruce Hornsby album)|The Way It Is]]'' sold more than three million albums, and the [[Dirty Dancing (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] for the film ''[[Dirty Dancing]]'', which cost RCA $200,000 to produce, sold 15.6 million copies in less than two years. Its follow-up, ''[[More Dirty Dancing]]'', composed of song tracks which had been left out of the first album, was produced for $80,000 and went on to sell more than 5.6 million.

(musical)|Hello, Dolly!]]'', ''[[Oliver!]]'', and ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]''. RCA has also recorded and released recordings of revival stagings of musicals. These include the musical productions staged at [[Lincoln Center]], such as the 1966 revivals of ''[[Show Boat]]'' and ''[[Annie Get Your Gun (musical)|Annie Get Your Gun]]'', the 1987 revival of ''[[Anything Goes]]'' and the 1998 Broadway revivals of ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]'' and ''[[The Sound of Music]]''. ''[[Call Me Madam]]'' was recorded by RCA Victor with all of its original cast except for its star [[Ethel Merman]], who, due to contractual obligations, could not be released from her American [[Decca Records]] contract. She was replaced on the RCA Victor album by [[Dinah Shore]]. RCA Victor was also responsible for the [[film soundtrack]] albums of ''Damn Yankees'', ''[[South Pacific (1958 film)|South Pacific]]'', ''[[Bye Bye Birdie (film)|Bye Bye Birdie]]'', ''[[Half a Sixpence (film)|Half a Sixpence]]'', and ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]''. The album made from the 1965 hit [[Julie Andrews]] film was (and is) one of the best selling soundtracks of all time. The film soundtrack of ''[[Oliver! (film)|Oliver!]]'', made by [[Colgems Records]], was distributed by RCA, which had released the Broadway cast album. RCA Victor also released the original American cast album of ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]''.\n\nSimilarly, RCA Victor also made several [[Studio recording|studio cast recording]] albums, including a [[Lerner and Loewe]] series with [[Jan Peerce]], [[Jane Powell]], and [[Robert Merrill]], as well as a 1963 album of excerpts from [[George Gershwin]]'s ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'', with its 1952 revival leads, [[Leontyne Price]] and [[William Warfield]], but a different supporting cast. They also issued two studio cast versions of ''Show Boat'', one with Robert Merrill, [[Patrice Munsel]], and [[Rise Stevens]] in 1956, and the other with [[Howard Keel]], [[Anne Jeffreys]], and [[Gogi Grant]] in 1958. Unfortunately, contrary to the way the show is written, both of these ''Show Boat'' albums featured all-white casts, reflecting the era of racial segregation.\n\nIn 2006, Sony BMG merged its Broadway music labels, including RCA Victor, to the new [[Masterworks Broadway Records]].

Clarkson wrote the songs on ''My December'', \"showcasing her own songwriting on darker, edgier rock-oriented fare\", and Davis insisted Clarkson work with hired hitmakers, as she had previously, on \"polished, radio-friendly songs\". Clarkson refused to change the album, and it was released in June 2007.

By the mid-to-late 1920s, Victor had signed [[Jelly Roll Morton]], [[Bennie Moten]], [[Duke Ellington]] and other black bands, and was becoming very competitive with Columbia and Brunswick, even starting their own V-38000 \"Hot Dance\" series that was marketed to all Victor dealers. They also had a V-38500 \"race\" ([[race records]]) series, a 23000 'hot dance' continuation of the V-38000 series, as well as a 23200 'Race' series with blues, gospel and some hard jazz. However, throughout the 1930s, Victor's involvement in jazz and blues slowed down and by the time of the musicians' strike and the end of the war, Victor was neglecting the R&B (race) scene, which is one of the reasons so many independent companies sprang up so successfully.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.elvispresleymuseum.com/RCA_Victor.html |title=RCA Victor |work=elvispresleymuseum |access-date=May 2, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 1960s, Victor decided to demolish its [[Camden, New Jersey|Camden]] warehouse.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rateyourmusic.com/label/rca_victor |title=Label: RCA Victor |publisher=RateyourMusic.com}}</ref> This warehouse reportedly held four floors' worth of catalog and vault masters (most of them were pre-tape wax and metal discs), test pressings, lacquer discs, matrix ledgers, and rehearsal recordings. The company retained some of the more important masters (such as those by [[Enrico Caruso]]; why [[Rachmaninoff]]'s apparently weren't saved is a mystery), but it is uncertain just how many others were saved or lost. A few days before the demolition took place, some collectors from the US and Europe were allowed to go through the warehouse and salvage whatever they could carry with them for their personal collections. Soon afterward, record collectors and RCA Victor officials watched from a nearby bridge as the warehouse was dynamited, with many studio masters still intact in the building. The remnants were bulldozed into the Delaware River and a pier was built on top of them. In 1973, to celebrate the centenary of Rachmaninoff's birth, RCA decided to reissue his complete recordings on LP; RCA was forced to go to collectors for copies of certain records because their archives were incomplete, as documented in a ''Time'' magazine article.\n\n==Other RCA labels==\n*RCA Records (UK): A division of [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony Music UK]], since 2006, which acts as an import label of American and multinational [[Sony Music]] artists, and also signs UK and Irish artists, including [[Paloma Faith]], [[Everything Everything]], [[Laura Mvula]], [[Little Mix]], [[Olly Murs]], and [[Kodaline]].\n*[[RCA Red Seal Records]]: The RCA Red Seal [[European Classical Music|classical music]] label is now part of [[Sony Masterworks]].\n*RCA Records (France): A division of [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony Music France]].
