It mainly covers an area of the historical and geographical region of [[Tropolje]]. As of 2013, it has a population of 33,032 inhabitants.\n\n== Name ==\nThe city name means literally \"Tomislav town\". The name was changed from \u017dupanjac to Tomislavgrad in 1925 by King [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia]] in tribute to his son [[Prince Tomislav of Yugoslavia|Prince Tomislav]] and also [[Tomislav of Croatia|Tomislav]], the first king of the [[Kingdom of Croatia (925\u20131102)|Kingdom of Croatia]], who was crowned in the area. The name was changed to Duvno after [[World War II]] by [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav communist authorities]]. In 1990 the name was restored to Tomislavgrad. Still, among inhabitants of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], the local residents are often referred as ''Duvnjaci'' (\"Duvniaks\") and the town is often called Duvno. Also, the town is sometimes referred to simply as \"Tomislav\". The Catholic diocese in that area is still called [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Mostar-Duvno|Mostar-Duvno]]. During the [[Roman Empire]] the town was called ''[[Delminium]]'' and during the medieval period in [[Kingdom of Croatia (925\u20131102)|Kingdom of Croatia]] and [[Kingdom of Bosnia]] it was called ''\u017dupanjac''. Under the [[Ottoman Empire]], it was called ''\u017dupanj-potok'' and in Austria-Hungary, ''\u017dupanjac''.\n[[File:Suica River, Suica BH.jpg|thumb|300px|The Duvno field]]\n\n== Location ==\nTomislavgrad is {{Convert|38|km|mi}} from the canton seat [[Livno]], {{Convert|88|km|mi}} from [[Mostar]], and {{Convert|162|km|mi}} from [[Sarajevo]].<ref>[https://archive.is/20130105041939/http://www.viamichelin.com/viamichelin/int/dyn/controller/Itineraires?strStartLocid=31NDRlYTYxMGNORE11TnpFeU1qaz1jTVRjdU1qQTVNemM9&strDestLocid=31NDNhZDMxMGNORE11T0RFM09UWT1jTVRjdU1ESXlOalE9strStartLocid=31NDRlYTYxMGNORE11TnpFeU1qaz1jTVRjdU1qQTVNemM9&strDestLocid=31NDNhZDMxMGNORE11T0RFM09UWT1jTVRjdU1ESXlOalE9&empriseW=315&empriseH=275&intItineraryType=5&caravaneHidden=false&vh=CAR&distance=km&strVehicle=0&devise=1.0|EUR&carbCost=1.3&isAvoidFrontiers=false&isFavoriseAutoroute=false&isAvoidPeage=false&isAvoidVignette=false&isAvoidLNR=false&autoConso=6.8&villeConso=6&routeConso=5.6&dtmDeparture=10/06/2009&indemnite=0&itineraryCarType=0&itineraryFuelType=0 ]</ref>\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n=== Municipality ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Duvno: Povijest \u017eupa duvanjskog samostana. Sveta ba\u0161tina. 1989</ref> [[Bronze Age]] (1800 BC - 800 BC) also left few marks in Tomislavgrad. Archeological collection of monastery in [[\u0160iroki Brijeg]] had few items founded on area of Tomislavgrad from Bronze Age: 34 bronze sickles, 3 axes and 2 spears. Those items were found in [[Stipanji\u0107i]] and [[Lug (Tomislavgrad)|Lug]] near Tomislavgrad. Those items were given to Archeological collection \"fra Mijo \u010cui\u0107 and fra Stjepan Naletili\u0107\". Later, Fr Vojislav Mikuli\u0107 found a bronze axe in [[Letka]] which he gave to those collections. Unfortunately, collection was destroyed in fire at the end of World War II. Only one sickle and axe survived the tragedy.<ref name=Bagaric/> However, this collection says that population of Tomislavgrad at the time worked in primary sector, they were cattlemen, farmers and warriors.<ref name=Bagaric/> \n\nUnlike their unnamed predecessors, [[Illyrians]] left material proofs from their time. On the slopes of the mountains which circle Tomislavgrad, Illyrians built 36 fortifications. These forts served as watchtower or forts against the enemy. There are also many graves of Illyrians which means that they cared about their dead. Same as forts, graves are dating from Bronze and Iron Age to Roman conquest of Delminium (Tomislavgrad). In the graves of dead Illyrians, jewellery and items which the dead used, were found.<ref name=Bagaric/>\n\nAnother inhabitants, except Illyrians, were [[Celts]]. They brought higher culture, crafts and most importantly better arms.<ref name=Bagaric2>{{in lang|hr}} Bagari\u0107, Ivo. Duvno - Short Monograph. \u017dupni ured sv. Franje Asi\u0161kog, Bukovica. 1980.</ref> But soon, Celts have been assimilated as Illyrians, since there was only small number of them.<ref name=Bagaric2/>\n\nAs Romans conquered territory of Illyrian tribe [[Ardiaei]], and so, [[Delmatae]]s and their tribal union were last bastion of Illyrian freedom. The Dalmatae attacked Roman wards near Neretva, Greek merchant towns and the Roman friendly Illyrian tribe [[Daors]]. The Illyrians upgraded their settlements into strong forts and surrounded their capital with wreath of smaller forts.<ref name=Bagaric2/> It is assumed that, during that time, 5,000 Dalmatae lived in Delminium.<ref name=Bagaric2/>\n\nIn 167 BC Illyrian forts could not stop Roman legions and Rome conquered the entire Adriatic coast south of Neretva; the state of the Ardieaei was also destroyed.  The first conflict between the Dalmatae and Rome started in 156 BC. The consuls [[Gaius Marcius Figulus (consul 162 BC)|Gaius Marcius Figulus]], then [[Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica Corculum]] conquered and destroyed Delminium; the latter received a triumph in Rome for this victory. Reports of writers during that time say that Delminium was a \"large city\", almost inaccessible and impregnable. Romans shot lighted arrows at wooden houses, which then burned the city.<ref name=Bagaric2/> After various rebellions led by Dalmatae and three wars with Rome, their land was lastly conquered for good in 9 AD.{{cn|date=March 2016}}\n\n====Roman time====\nAfter Roman conquest of Delminium, they started building roads and bridges. Roads that led to mainland of Balkans from Adriatic coast in [[Salona]] (Solin) and [[Narona]] ([[Vid, Croatia|Vid]] near [[Metkovi\u0107]]) crossed in Delminium (Tomislavgrad). Remains of those and other Roman roads are still in existence.<ref name=Bagaric/> Romans introduced their culture, language, legislation and religion. For next 400 years Tomislavgrad was in peace.\n\nAfter the Romans defeated Dalmatae, Tomislavgrad was almost abandoned. There was also, for some period, a military crew of Romans stationed there to keep Illyrians under control.<ref name=Bagaric/> Romans started to rebuild Delminium in 18 and 19 AD in time of emperor [[Tiberius]].<ref name=Bagaric/> During that time the center of the city was built, a Roman forum. This forum was built on possession of present-day Nikola Taveli\u0107 basilica.<ref name=Bagaric/> \n\nIn 1896 Fra An\u0111eo Nu\u0107 discovered various sculptures of Roman pagan deities, fragments of pagan sarcophagi, and fragments of columns of medieval Christian church. From all those discoveries, most prominent are two votive monuments and altars dedicated to goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], one altar dedicated to native Illyrian god Armatus and one votive plate dedicated to goddess [[Libera (mythology)|Libera]]. Later, relief of goddess Diana was also found and one relief of Diana and [[Silvanus (mythology)|Silvanus]] together. Also, new pagan altars, fragments of sarcophagi, clay pottery, parts of columns, and various other findings from Roman and early medieval age were found. This led to conclusion that on place of present-day Catholic graveyard \"Karaula\" (which was previously an Ottoman military border post and guardhouse) was Roman and Illyrian pagan sanctuary and graveyard.<ref name=Bagaric/>\n\n===Middle Ages===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}\nCroats settled this area in the 7th century, and the area was renamed to \u017dupanjac. The area around Tomislavgrad was important in Croatian history in Croatian early Middle Ages. According to the Cronicle of Doclea priest the most important event from this period was the first assembly of Croatia in the year 753. The first Croatian court was made at the mountain Lib when Croats have arrived to Duvno area. In that court duke Budimir has hosted the deputy of [[Pope Stephen II]] and Byzantine Emperor [[Constantine V]]. \n\nThere were made the prepairement for the Great assembly of kingdom and Church. At that assembly the country was divided on the three big regions, divided on more autonomous provinces, whose borders were taken from the Roman times. It has been determined the administration, taxes and justice system. It is a commonly accepted theory that coronation assembly of [[King Tomislav]] was placed in the 925 at that area.\n\nThe Duvno field with the city of \u017dupanjac was in the possession of Croatian kings till the 2nd half of the 13th century when it became the possession of noble family \u0160ubi\u0107. At the end of 13th and beginning of 14th century, the \u0160ubi\u0107 family, with approval from the [[Pope Boniface VIII]], established three dioceses on the territory of the [[Archdiocese of Split]], the Diocese of [[\u0160ibenik]], the Diocese of [[Makarska]] and the Diocese of Duvno. The motive for the establishment of those dioceses was to halt the spread of the [[Bosnian Church]] and strengthening of \u0160ubi\u0107s' influence in the area. The seat of the Diocese of Duvno was the Church of Saint John the Baptist, located in the town of Rog, near the present-day [[Ro\u0161ko Polje]]. The bishops of Duvno served mostly as assistants to the archbishop of Split or were only titular bishops.\n\nUntil 1320s, Duvno was part of the [[Croatia in the union with Hungary|Kingdom of Croatia]], when [[Stephen II, Ban of Bosnia]] took the land from \u0160ubi\u0107s and incorporated it in the [[Banate of Bosnia]]. Duvno became a part of the [[Tropolje|Western Regions]], a province of the Banate of Bosnia, together with [[Livno]] and [[Glamo\u010d]]. However, the population of the Western Regions didn't identify with the Bosnian Kingdom. After King [[Tvrtko I of Bosnia|Tvrtko]] gave in the territory of [[Zachlumia]] westwards from the [[Neretva]] river to the Hungarian and Croatian King [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis I]] in 1357, Duvno became the southwesternmost part of his realm towards the Kingdom of Croatia. \n\nA struggle broke out in the village of Kolo, in Duvno, in 1374, due to a division over loyalty between the Bosnian and Croatian-Hungarian King. For this reason, Tvrtko took over the village and gave it to the Semkovi\u0107 family from [[Usora (region)|Usora]], and their ownership over the village was confirmed by King [[Dabi\u0161a]] in 1395. In 1404, King [[Stephen Ostoja of Bosnia|Ostoja]] gave Duvno and Glamo\u010d to Duke [[Pavle Kle\u0161i\u0107]]. In 1444 or earlier, Duvno became a possession of [[Stjepan Vuk\u010di\u0107 Kosa\u010da]], the duke of the [[Duchy of Saint Sava]].\n\n===Ottoman Empire===\n[[File:D\u017eud\u017ea-D\u017eaferova d\u017eamija,TG.567.jpg|thumb|200px|D\u017eud\u017ea D\u017eafer Mosque in Tomislavgrad]]\nDuvno was conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] in 1477, who established the [[Nahiyah]] of Duvno, and incorporated it to the [[Sanjak of Herzegovina]]. It became part of the [[Kadiluk]] of [[Fo\u010da]]. Somewhere before 1519, Duvno was incorporated to the Kadiluk of [[Mostar]]. For a short period between 1528 and 1537, Duvno was part of the [[Sanjak of Bosnia]], and during the same period it was part of the Kadiluk of Neretva. It was again incorporated to the Sanjak of Herzegovina and the Kadiluk of Mostar.\n\nIn the middle 16th century, the Ottomans founded a [[qasaba]] \u017dupanj-Potok. In 1576 Duvno became part of the Kadiluk of [[Imotski]], and it became a kadiluk on its own before 1633. In the second half of the 17th century, Duvno became a part of the [[Sanjak of Klis]], however, it was soon returned to the Herzegovinian Sanjak. At the beginning of the 18th century, Duvno became a [[captaincy]], with the seat in the town of Rog. However, due to security reasons, the seat was transferred in 1711 to the Seddi Cedid, a fort built in \u017dupanj-Potok.\n\n[[Hamdija Kre\u0161evljakovi\u0107]] mentions a borough named ''Duvno'' at the end of the 17th century and also states that this borough became a [[kaza]] in the first years of the 18th century. In the middle of the 17th century [[Evliya \u00c7elebi]], a famous Turkish travel writer, stated that Duvno \"looks like a paradise garden, it is part of the Sanjak of Klis and has four hundred of houses and one imposing mosque, many masjids, one inn, one hamam and ten shops.\" Duvno remained under the Ottoman rule until 1878 when [[Austria-Hungary]] occupied Bosnia and Herzegovina after the [[Berlin Congress]].\n\n===Austria-Hungary===\n===Kingdom of Yugoslavia===\n{{unsourced|section|date=March 2016}}\n[[File:Stjepan Podhorsky- bazilika sv. \u0106irila i sv.

It mainly covers an area of the historical and geographical region of [[Tropolje]]. As of 2013, it has a population of 33,032 inhabitants.\n\n== Name ==\nThe city's second name Tomislavgrad means literally \"Tomislav's town\". The name was changed from \u017dupanjac to Tomislavgrad in 1925 by King [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia]] in tribute to his son [[Prince Tomislav of Yugoslavia|Prince Tomislav]] and also [[Tomislav of Croatia|Tomislav]], the first king of the [[Kingdom of Croatia (925\u20131102)|Kingdom of Croatia]], who was crowned in the area. The name was changed to Duvno after [[World War II]] by [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav communist authorities]]. In 1990 the name was restored to Tomislavgrad. Still, among inhabitants of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], the local residents are often referred as ''Duvnjaci'' (\"Duvniaks\") and the town is often called Duvno. Also, the town is sometimes referred to simply as \"Tomislav\". The Catholic diocese in that area is still called [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Mostar-Duvno|Mostar-Duvno]]. During the [[Roman Empire]] the town was called ''[[Delminium]]'' and during the medieval period in [[Kingdom of Croatia (925\u20131102)|Kingdom of Croatia]] and [[Kingdom of Bosnia]] it was called ''\u017dupanjac''. Under the [[Ottoman Empire]], it was called ''\u017dupanj-potok'' and in Austria-Hungary, ''\u017dupanjac''.\n[[File:Suica River, Suica BH.jpg|thumb|300px|The Duvno field]]\n\n== Location ==\nTomislavgrad is {{Convert|38|km|mi}} from the canton seat [[Livno]], {{Convert|88|km|mi}} from [[Mostar]], and {{Convert|162|km|mi}} from [[Sarajevo]].<ref>[https://archive.is/20130105041939/http://www.viamichelin.com/viamichelin/int/dyn/controller/Itineraires?strStartLocid=31NDRlYTYxMGNORE11TnpFeU1qaz1jTVRjdU1qQTVNemM9&strDestLocid=31NDNhZDMxMGNORE11T0RFM09UWT1jTVRjdU1ESXlOalE9strStartLocid=31NDRlYTYxMGNORE11TnpFeU1qaz1jTVRjdU1qQTVNemM9&strDestLocid=31NDNhZDMxMGNORE11T0RFM09UWT1jTVRjdU1ESXlOalE9&empriseW=315&empriseH=275&intItineraryType=5&caravaneHidden=false&vh=CAR&distance=km&strVehicle=0&devise=1.0|EUR&carbCost=1.3&isAvoidFrontiers=false&isFavoriseAutoroute=false&isAvoidPeage=false&isAvoidVignette=false&isAvoidLNR=false&autoConso=6.8&villeConso=6&routeConso=5.6&dtmDeparture=10/06/2009&indemnite=0&itineraryCarType=0&itineraryFuelType=0 ]</ref>\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n=== Municipality ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Duvno: Povijest \u017eupa duvanjskog samostana. Sveta ba\u0161tina. 1989</ref> [[Bronze Age]] (1800 BC - 800 BC) also left few marks in Tomislavgrad. Archeological collection of monastery in [[\u0160iroki Brijeg]] had few items founded on area of Duvno from Bronze Age: 34 bronze sickles, 3 axes and 2 spears. Those items were found in [[Stipanji\u0107i]] and [[Lug (Tomislavgrad)|Lug]] near Tomislavgrad. Those items were given to Archeological collection \"fra Mijo \u010cui\u0107 and fra Stjepan Naletili\u0107\". Later, Fr Vojislav Mikuli\u0107 found a bronze axe in [[Letka]] which he gave to those collections. Unfortunately, collection was destroyed in fire at the end of World War II. Only one sickle and axe survived the tragedy.<ref name=Bagaric/> However, this collection says that population of Tomislavgrad at the time worked in primary sector, they were cattlemen, farmers and warriors.<ref name=Bagaric/> \n\nUnlike their unnamed predecessors, [[Illyrians]] left material proofs from their time. On the slopes of the mountains which circle Tomislavgrad, Illyrians built 36 fortifications. These forts served as watchtower or forts against the enemy. There are also many graves of Illyrians which means that they cared about their dead. Same as forts, graves are dating from Bronze and Iron Age to Roman conquest of Delminium (Tomislavgrad). In the graves of dead Illyrians, jewellery and items which the dead used, were found.<ref name=Bagaric/>\n\nAnother inhabitants, except Illyrians, were [[Celts]]. They brought higher culture, crafts and most importantly better arms.<ref name=Bagaric2>{{in lang|hr}} Bagari\u0107, Ivo. Duvno - Short Monograph. \u017dupni ured sv. Franje Asi\u0161kog, Bukovica. 1980.</ref> But soon, Celts have been assimilated as Illyrians, since there was only small number of them.<ref name=Bagaric2/>\n\nAs Romans conquered territory of Illyrian tribe [[Ardiaei]], and so, [[Delmatae]]s and their tribal union were last bastion of Illyrian freedom. The Dalmatae attacked Roman wards near Neretva, Greek merchant towns and the Roman friendly Illyrian tribe [[Daors]]. The Illyrians upgraded their settlements into strong forts and surrounded their capital with wreath of smaller forts.<ref name=Bagaric2/> It is assumed that, during that time, 5,000 Dalmatae lived in Delminium.<ref name=Bagaric2/>\n\nIn 167 BC Illyrian forts could not stop Roman legions and Rome conquered the entire Adriatic coast south of Neretva; the state of the Ardieaei was also destroyed.  The first conflict between the Dalmatae and Rome started in 156 BC. The consuls [[Gaius Marcius Figulus (consul 162 BC)|Gaius Marcius Figulus]], then [[Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica Corculum]] conquered and destroyed Delminium; the latter received a triumph in Rome for this victory. Reports of writers during that time say that Delminium was a \"large city\", almost inaccessible and impregnable. Romans shot lighted arrows at wooden houses, which then burned the city.<ref name=Bagaric2/> After various rebellions led by Dalmatae and three wars with Rome, their land was lastly conquered for good in 9 AD.{{cn|date=March 2016}}\n\n====Roman time====\nAfter Roman conquest of Delminium, they started building roads and bridges. Roads that led to mainland of Balkans from Adriatic coast in [[Salona]] (Solin) and [[Narona]] ([[Vid, Croatia|Vid]] near [[Metkovi\u0107]]) crossed in Delminium (Tomislavgrad). Remains of those and other Roman roads are still in existence.<ref name=Bagaric/> Romans introduced their culture, language, legislation and religion. For next 400 years Tomislavgrad was in peace.\n\nAfter the Romans defeated Dalmatae, Tomislavgrad was almost abandoned. There was also, for some period, a military crew of Romans stationed there to keep Illyrians under control.<ref name=Bagaric/> Romans started to rebuild Delminium in 18 and 19 AD in time of emperor [[Tiberius]].<ref name=Bagaric/> During that time the center of the city was built, a Roman forum. This forum was built on possession of present-day Nikola Taveli\u0107 basilica.<ref name=Bagaric/> \n\nIn 1896 Fra An\u0111eo Nu\u0107 discovered various sculptures of Roman pagan deities, fragments of pagan sarcophagi, and fragments of columns of medieval Christian church. From all those discoveries, most prominent are two votive monuments and altars dedicated to goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], one altar dedicated to native Illyrian god Armatus and one votive plate dedicated to goddess [[Libera (mythology)|Libera]]. Later, relief of goddess Diana was also found and one relief of Diana and [[Silvanus (mythology)|Silvanus]] together. Also, new pagan altars, fragments of sarcophagi, clay pottery, parts of columns, and various other findings from Roman and early medieval age were found. This led to conclusion that on place of present-day Catholic graveyard \"Karaula\" (which was previously an Ottoman military border post and guardhouse) was Roman and Illyrian pagan sanctuary and graveyard.<ref name=Bagaric/>\n\n===Middle Ages===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}\nCroats settled this area in the 7th century, and the area was renamed to \u017dupanjac. The area around Tomislavgrad was important in Croatian history in Croatian early Middle Ages. According to the Cronicle of Doclea priest the most important event from this period was the first assembly of Croatia in the year 753. The first Croatian court was made at the mountain Lib when Croats have arrived to Tomislvagrad area. In that court, duke Budimir has hosted the deputy of [[Pope Stephen II]] and Byzantine Emperor [[Constantine V]]. \n\nThere were made the prepairement for the Great assembly of kingdom and Church. At that assembly the country was divided on the three big regions, divided on more autonomous provinces, whose borders were taken from the Roman times. It has been determined the administration, taxes and justice system. It is a commonly accepted theory that coronation assembly of [[King Tomislav]] was placed in the 925 at that area.\n\nThe Duvno field with the city of \u017dupanjac was in the possession of Croatian kings till the 2nd half of the 13th century when it became the possession of noble family \u0160ubi\u0107. At the end of 13th and beginning of 14th century, the \u0160ubi\u0107 family, with approval from the [[Pope Boniface VIII]], established three dioceses on the territory of the [[Archdiocese of Split]], the Diocese of [[\u0160ibenik]], the Diocese of [[Makarska]] and the Diocese of Duvno. The motive for the establishment of those dioceses was to halt the spread of the [[Bosnian Church]] and strengthening of \u0160ubi\u0107s' influence in the area. The seat of the Diocese of Duvno was the Church of Saint John the Baptist, located in the town of Rog, near the present-day [[Ro\u0161ko Polje]]. The bishops of Duvno served mostly as assistants to the archbishop of Split or were only titular bishops.\n\nUntil 1320s, Tomislavgrad was part of the [[Croatia in the union with Hungary|Kingdom of Croatia]], when [[Stephen II, Ban of Bosnia]] took the land from \u0160ubi\u0107s and incorporated it in the [[Banate of Bosnia]]. Tomislavgrad became a part of the [[Tropolje|Western Regions]], a province of the Banate of Bosnia, together with [[Livno]] and [[Glamo\u010d]]. However, the population of the Western Regions didn't identify with the Bosnian Kingdom. After King [[Tvrtko I of Bosnia|Tvrtko]] gave in the territory of [[Zachlumia]] westwards from the [[Neretva]] river to the Hungarian and Croatian King [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis I]] in 1357, Tomislavgrad became the southwesternmost part of his realm towards the Kingdom of Croatia. \n\nA struggle broke out in the village of Kolo, in Tomislavgrad, in 1374, due to a division over loyalty between the Bosnian and Croatian-Hungarian King. For this reason, Tvrtko took over the village and gave it to the Semkovi\u0107 family from [[Usora (region)|Usora]], and their ownership over the village was confirmed by King [[Dabi\u0161a]] in 1395. In 1404, King [[Stephen Ostoja of Bosnia|Ostoja]] gave Tomislavgrad and Glamo\u010d to Duke [[Pavle Kle\u0161i\u0107]]. In 1444 or earlier, Tomislavgrad became a possession of [[Stjepan Vuk\u010di\u0107 Kosa\u010da]], the duke of the [[Duchy of Saint Sava]].\n\n===Ottoman Empire===\n[[File:D\u017eud\u017ea-D\u017eaferova d\u017eamija,TG.567.jpg|thumb|200px|D\u017eud\u017ea D\u017eafer Mosque in Tomislavgrad]]\nTomislavgrad was conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] in 1477, who established the [[Nahiyah]] of Duvno, and incorporated it to the [[Sanjak of Herzegovina]]. It became part of the [[Kadiluk]] of [[Fo\u010da]]. Somewhere before 1519, Tomislavgrad was incorporated to the Kadiluk of [[Mostar]]. For a short period between 1528 and 1537, Tomislavgrad was part of the [[Sanjak of Bosnia]], and during the same period it was part of the Kadiluk of Neretva. It was again incorporated to the Sanjak of Herzegovina and the Kadiluk of Mostar.\n\nIn the middle 16th century, the Ottomans founded a [[qasaba]] \u017dupanj-Potok. In 1576 Tomislavgrad became part of the Kadiluk of [[Imotski]], and it became a kadiluk on its own before 1633. In the second half of the 17th century, Tomislavgrad became a part of the [[Sanjak of Klis]], however, it was soon returned to the Herzegovinian Sanjak. At the beginning of the 18th century, Tomislavgrad became a [[captaincy]], with the seat in the town of Rog. However, due to security reasons, the seat was transferred in 1711 to the Seddi Cedid, a fort built in \u017dupanj-Potok.\n\n[[Hamdija Kre\u0161evljakovi\u0107]] mentions a borough named ''Duvno'' at the end of the 17th century and also states that this borough became a [[kaza]] in the first years of the 18th century. In the middle of the 17th century [[Evliya \u00c7elebi]], a famous Turkish travel writer, stated that Tomislavgrad \"looks like a paradise garden, it is part of the Sanjak of Klis and has four hundred of houses and one imposing mosque, many masjids, one inn, one hamam and ten shops.\" Tomislavgrad remained under the Ottoman rule until 1878 when [[Austria-Hungary]] occupied Bosnia and Herzegovina after the [[Berlin Congress]].\n\n===Austria-Hungary===\n===Kingdom of Yugoslavia===\n{{unsourced|section|date=March 2016}}\n[[File:Stjepan Podhorsky- bazilika sv. \u0106irila i sv.

In practice Romania remains by and large off-limits to disabled travellers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://enchantingromania.com/wordpress/people-like-you/disabled-travellers/|title=Romania for disabled travellers|work=enchantingromania.com|accessdate=10 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Industrial and creative tourism==\n{{essay-like|section|date=November 2014}}\n\n[[Industrial tourism]], as a niche of tourism in Romania and as a solution to the restructuring and disappearance of former large industrial sites ([[mining]], [[metallurgy]], [[heavy industry]]), takes on interest in the country still slowly, despite the country's join to the [[European Union]] in 2007. Even if presently the country is confronted with a long and difficult economic transition, it has a rich industrial and scientific history with many of the world's priorities and still has surviving authentic traditional crafts and rural communities. Limited to some geographic areas and not yet on a large scale, by the means of European funds and projects, a sustainable revival of the traditional sector is supported, which also implies creative tourism participatory activities.<ref name=\"Tourist Capitalization of Industrial Heritage in Petrosani\">{{cite web|url=http://gtg.webhost.uoradea.ro/PDF/GTG-1-2010/7-GTG-Florina.pdf |title=Tourist Capitalization of Industrial Heritage in Petrosani |date=May 2010 |first1=C. |last1=Merciu |publisher=Geo Journal}}</ref>\n\nAgainst this big potential, there are relatively few entities, the majority being state owned, that are organizing, providing or permitting public visits, a main cause of this still being the weak implication and support of many public authorities. Meanwhile, the tourism stakeholders pay a relatively weak attention to the hard core of this niche ([[industrial heritage]], [[Technology|technique]], [[science]] and living [[industry]]), and practically there aren't many package offers of this kind on the market, with some notable exceptions: ethnographic and [[wine tourism]], also some rehabilitated industrial and forest narrow [[railways]] and [[steam engines]] still operating.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n===Primary attractions===\nAccording,<ref name=\"Directory of Industrial and Creative Tourism Attractions in Romania\">{{cite web|url=http://www.visitfactories.com/dromania.php?pageid=1 |title=Industrial and Creative Tourism Attractions in Romania |last=Hegedus |first=Marius |date=November 2014 |website=VisitFactories}}</ref> an industrial and creative tourism attractions web directory for [[Romania]] and some neighbouring countries, providing photos and short English descriptions of each objective, the main attractions open to the public are:\n\n* the national and regional technical and ethnographic [[museums]]: the Dimitrie Leonida National Technical Museum and the Aviation Museum in Bucharest, the [[mining]] museums in Brad, Petrosani, Rosia Montana, a technical museum in Iasi, the [[tram]] museum in Timisoara, the Oil Museum in Ploiesti, the [[astronomic]] observatories in Bucharest and Bacau, the [[village]] museums from Bucharest, Pitesti, Sibiu, Cluj, Timisoara, Valcea, Suceava; \n* the [[railway]] tourism on the recently rehabilitated narrow gauges from Brad, Abrud, Covasna, Moldovita, Agnita, Vaser, the Oravita - Anina [[mountain railway]] opened in 1864;\n* the [[power plant]] museums from Cernavoda ([[nuclear power|nuclear]]), Iron Gates (hydro, on the Danube, 2200 MW, the biggest in European Union), Sadu (hydro, built in 1896), Sinaia (hydro, built in 1899), Grebla - Resita (hydro, built in 1904);\n* [[factory tours]]: exception making some food ([[chocolate]], [[soft drinks]], [[yogurt]]) factories which provide visits for school children, there are no important companies ([[car]], [[manufacturing]], [[porcelain]], [[textile]], [[high technology]], etc.) to promote such tourist visits. However, some reference enterprises may accept visits at special requests (the Resita Works, [[metallurgy]], [[heavy machinery]], founded in 1771, having a very interesting museum too, The Ruschita Marble Exploitation). A remarkable visit program, started in October 2013, offers the Timisoreana [[brewery]], a factory founded in 1718, with very valuable heritage;\n* [[industrial heritage]]: even if valuable, a large majority of the [[monuments]] are still abandoned by their owners. However, a few exceptions could be mentioned;\n* [[motorsports]]: despite the missing of an international standard infrastructure like [[race track|raceways]], there are national federations organizing events for many categories and racing schools offering participatory courses;\n* the [[salt mines]] from: Turda, Praid, Cacica, Slanic Prahova, Ocnele Mari, Ocna Sibiului (salt lakes) are equally famous for their tourism interest (museums, underground entertainment parks) as well as [[therapeutic]] exploitation (respiratory diseases)\n* traditional [[crafts]]: wood [[carving]], [[weaving]], [[pottery]], [[glass]], [[embroidery]]. Many craftsmen preserved the traditions in some village areas from Moldavia, Transylvania and Oltenia. The majority are only selling their products on local markets, but they begin to organize and a few open their workshops to the tourists too;\n* [[wineries]]: some vineyards have incredible landscapes and the wines produced here have a well established and long tradition. Wine tourism provides presentations of the technologies and the storage caves, and is well developed in Romania. Famous big wineries: Murfatlar, Cotnari, Dragasani, Recas, Prahova Valley, Odobesti, Husi, Recas, Cricova (near Chisinau, in the Republic of Moldova, is huge, with about 80 kilometres of tunnels and caves)\n\n==Infrastructure==\nThere are [[Airports in Romania|16 international commercial airports]] in service today.

Meanwhile, the tourism stakeholders pay a relatively weak attention to the hard core of this niche ([[industrial heritage]], [[Technology|technique]], [[science]] and living [[industry]]), and practically there aren't many package offers of this kind on the market, with some notable exceptions: ethnographic and [[wine tourism]], also some rehabilitated industrial and forest narrow [[railways]] and [[steam engines]] still operating.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n===Primary attractions===\nAccording,<ref name=\"Directory of Industrial and Creative Tourism Attractions in Romania\">{{cite web|url=http://www.visitfactories.com/dromania.php?pageid=1 |title=Industrial and Creative Tourism Attractions in Romania |last=Hegedus |first=Marius |date=November 2014 |website=VisitFactories}}</ref> an industrial and creative tourism attractions web directory for [[Romania]] and some neighbouring countries, providing photos and short English descriptions of each objective, the main attractions open to the public are:\n\n* the national and regional technical and ethnographic [[museums]]: the Dimitrie Leonida National Technical Museum and the Aviation Museum in Bucharest, the [[mining]] museums in Brad, Petrosani, Rosia Montana, a technical museum in Iasi, the [[tram]] museum in Timisoara, the Oil Museum in Ploiesti, the [[astronomic]] observatories in Bucharest and Bacau, the [[village]] museums from Bucharest, Pitesti, Sibiu, Cluj, Timisoara, Valcea, Suceava; \n* the [[railway]] tourism on the recently rehabilitated narrow gauges from Brad, Abrud, Covasna, Moldovita, Agnita, Vaser, the Oravita - Anina [[mountain railway]] opened in 1864;\n* the [[power plant]] museums from Cernavoda ([[nuclear power|nuclear]]), Iron Gates (hydro, on the Danube, 2200 MW, the biggest in European Union), Sadu (hydro, built in 1896), Sinaia (hydro, built in 1899), Grebla - Resita (hydro, built in 1904);\n* [[factory tours]]: exception making some food ([[chocolate]], [[soft drinks]], [[yogurt]]) factories which provide visits for school children, there are no important companies ([[car]], [[manufacturing]], [[porcelain]], [[textile]], [[high technology]], etc.) to promote such tourist visits. However, some reference enterprises may accept visits at special requests (the Resita Works, [[metallurgy]], [[heavy machinery]], founded in 1771, having a very interesting museum too, The Ruschita Marble Exploitation). A remarkable visit program, started in October 2013, offers the Timisoreana [[brewery]], a factory founded in 1718, with very valuable heritage;\n* [[industrial heritage]]: even if valuable, a large majority of the [[monuments]] are still abandoned by their owners. However, a few exceptions could be mentioned;\n* [[motorsports]]: despite the missing of an international standard infrastructure like [[race track|raceways]], there are national federations organizing events for many categories and racing schools offering participatory courses;\n* the [[salt mines]] from: Turda, Praid, Cacica, Slanic Prahova, Ocnele Mari, Ocna Sibiului (salt lakes) are equally famous for their tourism interest (museums, underground entertainment parks) as well as [[therapeutic]] exploitation (respiratory diseases)\n* traditional [[crafts]]: wood [[carving]], [[weaving]], [[pottery]], [[glass]], [[embroidery]]. Many craftsmen preserved the traditions in some village areas from Moldavia, Transylvania and Oltenia. The majority are only selling their products on local markets, but they begin to organize and a few open their workshops to the tourists too;\n* [[wineries]]: some vineyards have incredible landscapes and the wines produced here have a well established and long tradition. Wine tourism provides presentations of the technologies and the storage caves, and is well developed in Romania. Famous big wineries: Murfatlar, Cotnari, Dragasani, Recas, Prahova Valley, Odobesti, Husi, Recas, Cricova (near Chisinau, in the Republic of Moldova, is huge, with about 80 kilometres of tunnels and caves)\n\n==Infrastructure==\nThere are [[Airports in Romania|16 international commercial airports]] in service today. Overall, airports in the country were transited in 2016 by 16.4 million passengers. The largest number of passengers was attracted by Bucharest's [[Henri Coand\u0103 International Airport]], which closed the year with a traffic of almost 11 million passengers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monitorulcj.ro/actualitate/58035-topul-aeroporturilor-din-romania-clujul-poate-face-pasul-spre-2-milioane-de-pasageri#sthash.HUSDHdNl.nKsvxBdQ.dpbs|title=Topul aeroporturilor din Rom\u00e2nia: Clujul face pasul spre 2 milioane de pasageri|website=monitorulcj.ro}}</ref>\n\nRomania also has a [[C\u0103ile Ferate Rom\u00e2ne|large network of railways]], [[The World Factbook|CIA World Factbook]] lists Romania with the 22nd largest railway network in the world.<ref>The World Factbook, ''[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2121rank.html Country Comparison: Railways'']</ref> The railway network is significantly interconnected with other European railway networks.\n\n==Natural Landscapes Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Defileul Ampoita (5165381590).jpg|Landscape in [[Alba County]]\nFile:F\u00e2nt\u00e2nele-Cogealac Wind Farm 2011.jpg|[[F\u00e2nt\u00e2nele-Cogealac Wind Farm]], the largest onshore Romanian and European wind farm\nFile:Pelicani din Delta Dunarii.PNG|[[The Danube Delta]]\nFile:The Black Sea near Constan\u0163a, Romania.JPG|The Black Sea near Constan\u021ba\nFile:North of Eforie Nord (AP4E7416 1PS) (29310147832).jpg|Dobrujan beach of Eforie Nord\nFile:Cascada bigar.jpg|Big\u0103r waterfall\nImage:Lacul_rosu1.jpg|[[Red Lake (Romania)|Red Lake]] in [[Harghita County]]\nFile:Gura Apei - Pasztor.jpg|Gura Apei Lake\nFile:Lacul Bucura.jpg|[[Bucura Lake]]\nFile:Wildlife in Vanatori-Neamt Natural Park, Romania.jpg|Wildlife in [[V\u00e2n\u0103tori-Neam\u021b Natural Park]]\nFile:Vanatori neamt.jpg|[[European bison]]s in [[V\u00e2n\u0103tori-Neam\u021b Natural Park]]\nFile:Rodnei Mountains, Maramures, Romania.

Additional ingredients, such as vegetable oils, salt, [[food coloring]], or sugar may be included. As a result, many flavors, colors, and textures of processed cheese exist. Its invention is credited to [[Walter Gerber]] of [[Thun]], [[Switzerland]], in 1911.\n\n== Advantages ==\n[[File:Processed cheese.jpg|thumb|A slice of processed cheese]]\nProcessed cheese has several technical advantages over natural cheese,<ref>{{Citation|title=AP-42, 9.6.1: Natural And Processed Cheese |url= https://www3.epa.gov/ttnchie1/ap42/ch09/final/c9s06-1.pdf |date= July 1997 |publisher= US EPA}}</ref> including a far longer [[shelf life]], resistance to separating when cooked (meltability), and a uniform look and physical behavior. Its mass-produced nature provides arguably its greatest advantage over natural cheese: a dramatically lower cost \u2014 to producers and consumers alike \u2014 than conventional [[cheesemaking]]. This, in turn, enables industrial-scale production volumes, lower distribution costs, a steadier supply, and much faster production time compared to traditional cheeses.\n\nThe use of emulsifiers in processed cheese results in a product that melts without separating when cooked; with prolonged heating, some natural cheeses (especially [[Cheddar cheese|cheddar]] and [[mozzarella]]) separate into a lumpy, molten [[protein]] gel and liquid [[fat]] combination. The emulsifiers (typically [[sodium phosphate]], [[potassium phosphate]], [[tartrate]], or [[citrate]]) reduce the tendency for tiny fat globules in the cheese to coalesce and pool on the surface.\n\nBecause processed cheese does not separate when melted, it is used as an ingredient in a variety of dishes. Unlike some unprocessed cheeses, heating does not alter its taste or texture.\n\n== Sale and labeling ==\nProcessed cheese is often sold in blocks, [[Easy Cheese|pressurized cans]], and packs of individual slices, often separated by wax paper, or with each slice individually wrapped by machine.\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nIn the United Kingdom, processed cheese is typically sold in individually wrapped slices, often referred to as \"singles\", or in foil-wrapped portions. [[Dairylea (cheese)|Dairylea]] and [[The Laughing Cow]] are leading brands.\n\n=== United States ===\n{{See also|American cheese}}\n[[File:Single wrapped slice of processed cheese.jpg|thumb|186x186px|[[American cheese]] is a processed cheese.

This form of sliced cheese (and its derivatives) have become ubiquitous in U.S. households ever since, most notably used for [[cheeseburgers]] and [[grilled cheese sandwiches]] because of its ability to cook evenly, distribute/stretch smoothly, and resist [[Congelation|congealing]], unlike traditional [[cheddar cheese]]s.

Additional ingredients, such as vegetable oils, salt, [[food coloring]], or sugar may be included. As a result, many flavors, colors, and textures of processed cheese exist. Its invention is credited to [[Walter Gerber]] of [[Thun]], [[Switzerland]], in 1911.\n\n== Advantages ==\n[[File:Processed cheese.jpg|thumb|A slice of processed cheese]]\nProcessed cheese has several technical advantages over natural cheese,<ref>{{Citation|title=AP-42, 9.6.1: Natural And Processed Cheese |url= https://www3.epa.gov/ttnchie1/ap42/ch09/final/c9s06-1.pdf |date= July 1997 |publisher= US EPA}}</ref> including a far longer [[shelf life]], resistance to separating when cooked (meltability), and a uniform look and physical behavior. Its mass-produced nature provides arguably its greatest advantage over natural cheese: a dramatically lower cost \u2014 to producers and consumers alike \u2014 than conventional [[cheesemaking]]. This, in turn, enables industrial-scale production volumes, lower distribution costs, a steadier supply, and much faster production time compared to traditional cheeses.\n\nThe use of emulsifiers in processed cheese results in a product that melts without separating when cooked; with prolonged heating, some natural cheeses (especially [[Cheddar cheese|cheddar]] and [[mozzarella]]) separate into a lumpy, molten [[protein]] gel and liquid [[fat]] combination. The emulsifiers (typically [[sodium phosphate]], [[potassium phosphate]], [[tartrate]], or [[citrate]]) reduce the tendency for tiny fat globules in the cheese to coalesce and pool on the surface.\n\nBecause processed cheese does not separate when melted, it is used as an ingredient in a variety of dishes. Unlike some unprocessed cheeses, heating does not alter its taste or texture.\n\n== Sale and labeling ==\nProcessed cheese is often sold in blocks, [[Easy Cheese|pressurized cans]], and packs of individual slices, often separated by wax paper, or with each slice individually wrapped by machine.\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nIn the United Kingdom, processed cheese is typically sold in individually wrapped slices, often referred to as \"singles\", or in foil-wrapped portions.
