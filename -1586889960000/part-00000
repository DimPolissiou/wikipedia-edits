Iranian Elements in Azeri Turki \u2013 Encyclopaedia Iranica|last=electricpulp.com}}</ref>\n\nTurkish language of Azerbaijan gradually supplanted the Iranian languages in what is now northern Iran, and a variety of [[languages of the Caucasus]] and [[Iranian languages]] spoken in the [[Caucasus]], particularly [[Udi language|Udi]] and [[Old Azeri language|Old Azeri]]. By the beginning of the 16th century, it had become the dominant language of the region, and was a spoken language in the court of the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavids]] and [[Afsharid dynasty|Afsharids]].\n\nThe historical development of Azerbaijani can be divided into two major periods: early (c. 16th to 18th century) and modern (18th century to present). Early Azerbaijani differs from its descendant in that it contained a much larger number of Persian, and Arabic loanwords, phrases and syntactic elements. Early writings in Azerbaijani also demonstrate linguistic interchangeability between Oghuz and Kypchak elements in many aspects (such as pronouns, case endings, participles, etc.). As Azerbaijani gradually moved from being merely a language of [[epic poetry|epic]] and [[lyric poetry]] to being also a language of [[journalism]] and [[science|scientific]] [[research]], its literary version has become more or less unified and simplified with the loss of many archaic Turkic elements, stilted Iranisms and Ottomanisms, and other words, expressions, and rules that failed to gain popularity among the Azerbaijani masses.\n\nBetween c. 1900 and 1930, there were several competing approaches to the unification of the national language in what is now the Azerbaijan Republic, popularized by the scholars such as [[Hasan bey Zardabi]] and [[Mammad agha Shahtakhtinski]]. Despite major differences, they all aimed primarily at making it easy for semi-literate masses to read and understand literature. They all criticized the overuse of Persian, Arabic, and European elements in both colloquial and literary language and called for a simpler and more popular style.\n\nThe Russian [[Russo-Persian Wars|conquest]] of [[Transcaucasia]] in the 19th century split the language community across two states; the [[Soviet Union]] promoted development of the language, but set it back considerably with two successive script changes<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/81_folder/81_articles/81_alphabet_changes1.html|title=Alphabet Changes in Azerbaijan in the 20th Century|website=[[Azerbaijan International]]|date=Spring 2000|accessdate=21 July 2013}}</ref> \u2013 from the [[Persian alphabet|Persian]] to [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] and then to the [[Cyrillic script]] \u2013 while Iranian Azerbaijanis continued to use the Persian script as they always had.

This is because there is a strong [[T-V distinction|tu-vous distinction]] in Turkic languages like Azerbaijani and Turkish (as well as in many other languages). The informal \"you\" is used when talking to close friends, relatives, animals or children. The formal \"you\" is used when talking to someone who is older than you or someone for whom you would like to show respect (a professor, for example).\n\nAs in many Turkic languages, personal pronouns can be omitted, and they are only added for emphasis.

Iranian Elements in Azeri Turki \u2013 Encyclopaedia Iranica|last=electricpulp.com}}</ref>\n\nTurkic language of Azerbaijan gradually supplanted the Iranian languages in what is now northern Iran, and a variety of [[languages of the Caucasus]] and [[Iranian languages]] spoken in the [[Caucasus]], particularly [[Udi language|Udi]] and [[Old Azeri language|Old Azeri]]. By the beginning of the 16th century, it had become the dominant language of the region, and was a spoken language in the court of the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavids]] and [[Afsharid dynasty|Afsharids]].\n\nThe historical development of Azerbaijani can be divided into two major periods: early (c. 16th to 18th century) and modern (18th century to present). Early Azerbaijani differs from its descendant in that it contained a much larger number of Persian, and Arabic loanwords, phrases and syntactic elements. Early writings in Azerbaijani also demonstrate linguistic interchangeability between Oghuz and Kypchak elements in many aspects (such as pronouns, case endings, participles, etc.). As Azerbaijani gradually moved from being merely a language of [[epic poetry|epic]] and [[lyric poetry]] to being also a language of [[journalism]] and [[science|scientific]] [[research]], its literary version has become more or less unified and simplified with the loss of many archaic Turkic elements, stilted Iranisms and Ottomanisms, and other words, expressions, and rules that failed to gain popularity among the Azerbaijani masses.\n\nBetween c. 1900 and 1930, there were several competing approaches to the unification of the national language in what is now the Azerbaijan Republic, popularized by the scholars such as [[Hasan bey Zardabi]] and [[Mammad agha Shahtakhtinski]]. Despite major differences, they all aimed primarily at making it easy for semi-literate masses to read and understand literature. They all criticized the overuse of Persian, Arabic, and European elements in both colloquial and literary language and called for a simpler and more popular style.\n\nThe Russian [[Russo-Persian Wars|conquest]] of [[Transcaucasia]] in the 19th century split the language community across two states; the [[Soviet Union]] promoted development of the language, but set it back considerably with two successive script changes<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/81_folder/81_articles/81_alphabet_changes1.html|title=Alphabet Changes in Azerbaijan in the 20th Century|website=[[Azerbaijan International]]|date=Spring 2000|accessdate=21 July 2013}}</ref> \u2013 from the [[Persian alphabet|Persian]] to [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] and then to the [[Cyrillic script]] \u2013 while Iranian Azerbaijanis continued to use the Persian script as they always had.

Also, some consonants can be represented by more than one letter.  The Azerbaijani Latin alphabet is based on the Turkish Latin alphabet, which in turn was based on former Azerbaijani Latin alphabet because of their linguistic connections and mutual intelligibility.

This is because there is a strong [[T-V distinction|tu-vous distinction]] in Turkic languages like Azerbaijani and Turkish (as well as in many other languages). The informal \"you\" is used when talking to close friends, relatives, animals or children. The formal \"you\" is used when talking to someone who is older than you or someone for whom you would like to show respect (a professor, for example).\n\nAs in many Turkic languages, personal pronouns can be omitted, and they are only added for emphasis.

With these estimates of growth, the study also suggests the maximum ages of the fish to be 30 years for males and 26 for females with the maturity age of the sample being 13.4 years for males and 11. 2 years for females.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.552.6401&rep=rep1&type=pdf|title=Preliminary Age and Growth Estimates of the Rabbitfish,\nChimaera monstrosa, with Implications for\nFuture Resource Management|last=Calis|first=E.|date=|website=citeseerx.ist.psu.edu|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref>\n\n<br />\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nThe geographic habitat of the Chimaera Monstrosa has registered around the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the Eastern parts of the Atlantic Ocean. This geographic range starts northwards Morrocco and extends to the northern areas of Norway and Iceland in the Northern North Sea. \u00a0\n\nWithin these geological areas, the Chimaera Monstrosa prefers the upper to middle continental slope habitats at depths of 300 m to 500 m (980-1,640 ft). The range of the Chimaera Monstrosa is 50 m to 1,000 m, however, is most abundant between 300 and 500 m. Within these parameters, the waters of the habitats of the Chimaera Monstrosa is most commonly between 4.7 - 8 C\u00b0 (40.46 - 46.4 F\u00b0). There have been reports of summer inshore migration of the Chimaera Monstrosa to lay eggs in depth as low as 100 m.\n\n==Diet==\nThe Chimaera Monstrosa are classified as [[benthophagous]] species. This means that their main diet comprises bottom-feeding invertebrates. This includes animals such as crabs, mollusks, octopuses, sea-worms, and sea urchins. However, studies have also shown that the Chimaera Monstrosa are [[opportunistic feeders]]. Comparing the digestive tracts of the species with varying body sizes, the study found that the diet of Chimaera Monstrosa was widely diverse in relation to size. Specimens smaller than 22 cm mainly fed on amphipods, while those with lengths between 22 and 46 cm fed on [[Amphipoda|amphipods]] and [[Decapoda|decapods]]. Larger individuals (>46 cm) had a narrow diet spectrum, consuming mainly decapods. Conditioned by predator size group, significant differences in diet were observed between geographical areas and depths. This suggests that despite some degree of prey specialization according to predator size, this deep-water species can change its diet in accordance with the food-restricted environment that characterizes its habitat.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=|title=Feeding habits of Chimaera monstrosa L.

This structure is suggested to be used by male fish to grasp the pectoral fin of the female during copulation Chimaera Monstrosa are also Oviparous fish, meaning that the embryo development happens in eggs, and not in the female. Specifically, when referring to the Reproductive tendencies of the Chimaera Monstrosa show sexual segregation in different depths of water, with the female living in lower depth in water. The segregation of sex is attributed to two main factors: the regulation of sperm in males in warmer and shallower waters, and less aggression of sex.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Holt|first=Rebecca E.|last2=Foggo|first2=Andrew|last3=Neat|first3=Francis C.|last4=Howell|first4=Kerry L.|date=2013-09-01|title=Distribution patterns and sexual segregation in chimaeras: implications for conservation and management|url=https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article/70/6/1198/636894|journal=ICES Journal of Marine Science|language=en|volume=70|issue=6|pages=1198\u20131205|doi=10.1093/icesjms/fst058|issn=1054-3139}}</ref> For males, they live in water 500-600 m to regulate sperm.

With these estimates of growth, the study also suggests the maximum ages of the fish to be 30 years for males and 26 for females with the maturity age of the sample being 13.4 years for males and 11. 2 years for females.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.552.6401&rep=rep1&type=pdf|title=Preliminary Age and Growth Estimates of the Rabbitfish,\nChimaera monstrosa, with Implications for\nFuture Resource Management|last=Calis|first=E.|date=|website=citeseerx.ist.psu.edu|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref>\n\n<br />\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nThe geographic habitat of the Chimaera Monstrosa has registered around the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the Eastern parts of the Atlantic Ocean. This geographic range starts northwards Morrocco and extends to the northern areas of Norway and Iceland in the Northern North Sea. \u00a0\n\nWithin these geological areas, the Chimaera Monstrosa prefers the upper to middle continental slope habitats at depths of 300 m to 500 m (980-1,640 ft). The range of the Chimaera Monstrosa is 50 m to 1,000 m, however, is most abundant between 300 and 500 m. Within these parameters, the waters of the habitats of the Chimaera Monstrosa is most commonly between 4.7 - 8 C\u00b0 (40.46 - 46.4 F\u00b0). There have been reports of summer inshore migration of the Chimaera Monstrosa to lay eggs in depth as low as 100 m.\n\n==Diet==\nThe Chimaera Monstrosa are classified as [[benthophagous]] species. This means that their main diet comprises bottom-feeding invertebrates. This includes animals such as crabs, mollusks, octopuses, sea-worms, and sea urchins. However, studies have also shown that the Chimaera Monstrosa are [[opportunistic feeders]]. Comparing the digestive tracts of the species with varying body sizes, the study found that the diet of Chimaera Monstrosa was widely diverse in relation to size. Specimens smaller than 22 cm mainly fed on amphipods, while those with lengths between 22 and 46 cm fed on [[Amphipoda|amphipods]] and [[Decapoda|decapods]]. Larger individuals (>46 cm) had a narrow diet spectrum, consuming mainly decapods. Conditioned by predator size group, significant differences in diet were observed between geographical areas and depths. This suggests that despite some degree of prey specialization according to predator size, this deep-water species can change its diet in accordance with the food-restricted environment that characterizes its habitat.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=|title=Feeding habits of Chimaera monstrosa L.

They reproduce by internal fertilization of male and female.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fishbase.se/Reproduction/FishReproSummary.php?ID=2503&GenusName=Chimaera&SpeciesName=monstrosa&fc=25&StockCode=2697|title=Reproduction Summary - Chimaera monstrosa|website=www.fishbase.se|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> For reproduction, Chimaera Monstrosa displays a small club like structure with a bulbous tip armed with numerous sharp denticles located on the top of the head . This structure is suggested to be used by male fish to grasp the pectoral fin of the female during copulation Chimaera Monstrosa are also Oviparous fish, meaning that the embryo development happens in eggs, and not in the female. Specifically, when referring to the Reproductive tendencies of the Chimaera Monstrosa show sexual segregation in different depths of water, with the female living in lower depth in water. The segregation of sex is attributed to two main factors: the regulation of sperm in males in warmer and shallower waters, and less aggression of sex.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Holt|first=Rebecca E.|last2=Foggo|first2=Andrew|last3=Neat|first3=Francis C.|last4=Howell|first4=Kerry L.|date=2013-09-01|title=Distribution patterns and sexual segregation in chimaeras: implications for conservation and management|url=https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article/70/6/1198/636894|journal=ICES Journal of Marine Science|language=en|volume=70|issue=6|pages=1198\u20131205|doi=10.1093/icesjms/fst058|issn=1054-3139}}</ref> For males, they live in water 500-600 m to regulate sperm. For the females, they prefer deeper waters of 800 m, but go up to depths of 500-600 to mate with males.

As well as his solo career, he is known for being the frontman of [[Murderdolls]]. He has also played in several other bands, including Maniac Spider Trash, [[Frankenstein Drag Queens from Planet 13]], [[Bourbon Crow]], and Gunfire 76.\n\n==Musical career==\n===Psycho Opera and Maniac Spider Trash===\nPoole's musical career began in 1992 when he played guitar in the band Mizery, which later became Psycho Opera and which featured guitarist Abby Normal, drummer Jeff Washam, bassist Michael Patrick, and lead vocalist Todd Cage. Poole left the band to form Maniac Spider Trash as lead vocalist, alongside Abby Normal (again on guitar) and Michael Patrick (also filling his earlier role as bassist), joined by Sicko Zero on drums. Poole fronted the band from 1992 to 1996. The band released one [[Extended play|EP]], ''Dumpster Mummies'', on Dead Hell Records in 1994. This was followed by an album, ''Murder Happy Fairytales'', in 1995; the album remained unreleased until October 5, 2010.\n\n===Frankenstein Drag Queens from Planet 13===\n{{Main|Frankenstein Drag Queens from Planet 13}}\nPoole went on to form the [[Frankenstein Drag Queens from Planet 13]], which included Maniac Spider Trash's guitarist and drummer, Abby Normal and Sicko Zero. The band featured several different guitarists, bassists, and drummers over the years, leaving Poole to continue as the only original member. Sicko Zero was the last member to quit the band. Shortly after, Poole was forced to form another line-up before joining [[Murderdolls]]. Poole wrote and produced every album by Frankenstein Drag Queens from Planet 13. Between 1996 and 2002, Frankenstein Drag Queens from Planet 13 released five studio albums and six [[Extended play|EP]]s with various revolving members. They were also featured on [[tribute album]]s for [[Alice Cooper]], and [[The Sweet|Sweet]]. Poole stopped performing under the name in 2002 when he joined Murderdolls. In May 2006, the band announced their reunion, which was followed by a tour with [[Alice Cooper]] and a box set of the band's complete discography, entitled ''Little Box of Horrors''. This line-up featured Sicko Zero on drums and Abby Normal on bass. The band broke up once again shortly after the box set was released.\n\n===Murderdolls===\n{{Main|Murderdolls}}\nPoole was contacted by [[Joey Jordison]] of [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]] and was asked to join Jordison's new horror punk band, [[Murderdolls]]. Originally formed as a collaboration between Jordison and [[Tripp Eisen]] of [[Static-X]] and [[Dope (band)|Dope]], Poole was revealed as the driving force of the band after he switched from bass guitar to lead vocalist. Murderdolls released one EP in 2002, ''[[Right to Remain Violent]]'', to promote their forthcoming album of the same year, ''[[Beyond the Valley of the Murderdolls]]''. Most of the songs on the album were re-recorded versions of songs by Poole's previous band, Frankenstein Drag Queens from Planet 13. A total of two singles were released from the album, including a cover of [[Billy Idol]]'s \"[[White Wedding (song)|White Wedding]]\". The album reached No. 40 on the UK album chart.\n\nMurderdolls played their last show on January 17, 2004. After this, they went on an indefinite hiatus, with Jordison returning to Slipknot. Since this hiatus began, both Poole and Jordison maintained that the band did not split up for good, and that they would return to record a second album in the future. In February 2010, while on a solo tour in Australia, Poole spoke with Drum Media: \"We're possibly going to do another Wednesday record, record it in the summer and have it out around Halloween. We're in talks right now to do another Murderdolls album. So right now I don't know which of the two is going to happen, of course if Murderdolls is possible then we have to do that, it's gotta be the number one priority. It's just talks right now. We're having the same conversations that we were having in the very beginning of the band. Right now, we're just trying to get a game plan together.\"\n\nIn March 2010, Jordison revealed to [[Kerrang|''Kerrang'' magazine]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.kerrang.com/2010/03/exclusive_murderdolls_are_back.html |title=Kerrang! Exclusive! Murderdolls are back! |website=Kerrang.com |accessdate=August 20, 2010}}</ref> that Murderdolls had reunited to work with producer Chris Harris. Jordison said: \"It's been an ongoing conversation between Wednesday and I from 2006 until now. We were bored with everything out there, and thought we had something to piss people off and shake things up. Everything is such a product or a fucking formula these days... fuck formula! Fuck the norm!\" Murderdolls released their second album, ''Women and Children Last'', on August 31, 2010. In March 2013, Wednesday 13 announced in an interview that the Murderdolls had split for good in 2011{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}.\n\n===Wednesday 13===\nAfter the Murderdolls went on hiatus in 2004, Poole went on a solo tour of the United Kingdom in March 2004, called the ''Graveyard A Go-Go'' tour. For his live performances, he was joined by members of horror punk band Death Becomes You, though this was not meant to be permanent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/artists/Wednesday13/ |title=Wednesday 13 |publisher=Roadrunner Records |accessdate=July 13, 2009}}</ref> Poole returned to North Carolina in June 2004, and began to put together a more permanent band, with whom he would perform with under the Wednesday 13 name. He brought in former Frankenstein Drag Queens member, Ikky, on guitar. The band is heavily influenced by the likes of [[KISS (band)|KISS]] and Alice Cooper, while not straying far from Poole's previous horror punk projects. In September 2004, Ikky was replaced with [[Matt Montgomery]]. Wednesday 13 toured Europe in November 2004 on the ''Look What the Bats Dragged in'' tour. Some of the dates were supported by English rockers [[Viking Skull]].\n\nIn 2005, after touring, Poole released his debut album ''[[Transylvania 90210]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/music/view.aspx?songID=1443 |title=Wednesday 13 \u2013 Transylvania 90210 &#124; Music |publisher=Roadrunner Records |date=April 12, 2005 |accessdate=July 13, 2009}}</ref> and made a [[music video]] for the track \"I Walked with a Zombie\", depicting the band members in footage from the original ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'' horror movie. Following the album's release, the group embarked on a tour of the United Kingdom, entitled ''Tour from the Crypt''. Also in 2005, they played on the main stage of [[Download Festival]] at [[Donington Park|Donington]], and opened some shows for Alice Cooper around Halloween.\n\nPoole parted ways with [[Roadrunner Records]] before signing a new deal with [[Rykodisc]], with whom he released ''[[Fang Bang]]'', the follow-up to \"Transylvania 90210\", on September 12, 2006.<ref>{{cite web|author=Dan Hammer |url=http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/wednesday-13-is-back/ |title=Blog Archive \u00bb Wednesday 13 is back |publisher=Metal Hammer |date=July 11, 2006 |accessdate=July 13, 2009}}</ref> The European version of the album contains a cover of [[Mot\u00f6rhead]]'s \"[[R.A.M.O.N.E.S.]]\" and the Japanese edition features the same track listing as the European CD, along with a bonus song entitled \"Good Day to Die\". The American edition features \"Burn the Flames\", a [[Roky Erickson]] cover, as its sole bonus track. ''[[Skeletons (Wednesday 13 album)|Skeletons]]'' was released on April 29, 2008, available exclusively through [[Hot Topic]] locations in the United States.

Wednesday 13 was in contact with former drummer Jeff Washam from Psycho Opera and was going to tour on the East Coast project. Scheduling prevented JW from doing the tour. The band released their first album in 2006, ''[[Highway to Hangovers]]'', and their second album, ''Long Way to the Bottom'', was released in 2009.

As well as his solo career, he is known for being the frontman of [[Murderdolls]]. He has also played in several other bands, including Maniac Spider Trash, [[Frankenstein Drag Queens from Planet 13]], [[Bourbon Crow]], and Gunfire 76.\n\n==Musical career==\n===Psycho Opera and Maniac Spider Trash===\nPoole's musical career began in 1992 when he played guitar in the band Mizery, which later became Psycho Opera and which featured guitarist Abby Normal, drummer Jeff Washam, bassist Michael Patrick, and lead vocalist Todd Cage. Poole left the band to form Maniac Spider Trash as lead vocalist, alongside Abby Normal (again on guitar) and Michael Patrick (also filling his earlier role as bassist), joined by Sicko Zero on drums. Poole fronted the band from 1992 to 1996. The band released one [[Extended play|EP]], ''Dumpster Mummies'', on Dead Hell Records in 1994. This was followed by an album, ''Murder Happy Fairytales'', in 1995; the album remained unreleased until October 5, 2010.\n\n===Frankenstein Drag Queens from Planet 13===\n{{Main|Frankenstein Drag Queens from Planet 13}}\nPoole went on to form the [[Frankenstein Drag Queens from Planet 13]], which included Maniac Spider Trash's guitarist and drummer, Abby Normal and Sicko Zero. The band featured several different guitarists, bassists, and drummers over the years, leaving Poole to continue as the only original member. Sicko Zero was the last member to quit the band. Shortly after, Poole was forced to form another line-up before joining [[Murderdolls]]. Poole wrote and produced every album by Frankenstein Drag Queens from Planet 13. Between 1996 and 2002, Frankenstein Drag Queens from Planet 13 released five studio albums and six [[Extended play|EP]]s with various revolving members. They were also featured on [[tribute album]]s for [[Alice Cooper]], and [[The Sweet|Sweet]]. Poole stopped performing under the name in 2002 when he joined Murderdolls. In May 2006, the band announced their reunion, which was followed by a tour with [[Alice Cooper]] and a box set of the band's complete discography, entitled ''Little Box of Horrors''. This line-up featured Sicko Zero on drums and Abby Normal on bass. The band broke up once again shortly after the box set was released.\n\n===Murderdolls===\n{{Main|Murderdolls}}\nPoole was contacted by [[Joey Jordison]] of [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]] and was asked to join Jordison's new horror punk band, [[Murderdolls]]. Originally formed as a collaboration between Jordison and [[Tripp Eisen]] of [[Static-X]] and [[Dope (band)|Dope]], Poole was revealed as the driving force of the band after he switched from bass guitar to lead vocalist. Murderdolls released one EP in 2002, ''[[Right to Remain Violent]]'', to promote their forthcoming album of the same year, ''[[Beyond the Valley of the Murderdolls]]''. Most of the songs on the album were re-recorded versions of songs by Poole's previous band, Frankenstein Drag Queens from Planet 13. A total of two singles were released from the album, including a cover of [[Billy Idol]]'s \"[[White Wedding (song)|White Wedding]]\". The album reached No. 40 on the UK album chart.\n\nMurderdolls played their last show on January 17, 2004. After this, they went on an indefinite hiatus, with Jordison returning to Slipknot. Since this hiatus began, both Poole and Jordison maintained that the band did not split up for good, and that they would return to record a second album in the future. In February 2010, while on a solo tour in Australia, Poole spoke with Drum Media: \"We're possibly going to do another Wednesday record, record it in the summer and have it out around Halloween. We're in talks right now to do another Murderdolls album. So right now I don't know which of the two is going to happen, of course if Murderdolls is possible then we have to do that, it's gotta be the number one priority. It's just talks right now. We're having the same conversations that we were having in the very beginning of the band. Right now, we're just trying to get a game plan together.\"\n\nIn March 2010, Jordison revealed to [[Kerrang|''Kerrang'' magazine]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.kerrang.com/2010/03/exclusive_murderdolls_are_back.html |title=Kerrang! Exclusive! Murderdolls are back! |website=Kerrang.com |accessdate=August 20, 2010}}</ref> that Murderdolls had reunited to work with producer Chris Harris. Jordison said: \"It's been an ongoing conversation between Wednesday and I from 2006 until now. We were bored with everything out there, and thought we had something to piss people off and shake things up. Everything is such a product or a fucking formula these days... fuck formula! Fuck the norm!\" Murderdolls released their second album, ''Women and Children Last'', on August 31, 2010. In March 2013, Wednesday 13 announced in an interview that the Murderdolls had split for good in 2011{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}.\n\n===Wednesday 13===\nAfter the Murderdolls went on hiatus in 2004, Poole went on a solo tour of the United Kingdom in March 2004, called the ''Graveyard A Go-Go'' tour. For his live performances, he was joined by members of horror punk band Death Becomes You, though this was not meant to be permanent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/artists/Wednesday13/ |title=Wednesday 13 |publisher=Roadrunner Records |accessdate=July 13, 2009}}</ref> Poole returned to North Carolina in June 2004, and began to put together a more permanent band, with whom he would perform with under the Wednesday 13 name. He brought in former Frankenstein Drag Queens member, Ikky, on guitar. The band is heavily influenced by the likes of [[KISS (band)|KISS]] and Alice Cooper, while not straying far from Poole's previous horror punk projects. In September 2004, Ikky was replaced with [[Matt Montgomery]]. Wednesday 13 toured Europe in November 2004 on the ''Look What the Bats Dragged in'' tour. Some of the dates were supported by English rockers [[Viking Skull]].\n\nIn 2005, after touring, Poole released his debut album ''[[Transylvania 90210]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/music/view.aspx?songID=1443 |title=Wednesday 13 \u2013 Transylvania 90210 &#124; Music |publisher=Roadrunner Records |date=April 12, 2005 |accessdate=July 13, 2009}}</ref> and made a [[music video]] for the track \"I Walked with a Zombie\", depicting the band members in footage from the original ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'' horror movie. Following the album's release, the group embarked on a tour of the United Kingdom, entitled ''Tour from the Crypt''. Also in 2005, they played on the main stage of [[Download Festival]] at [[Donington Park|Donington]], and opened some shows for Alice Cooper around Halloween.\n\nPoole parted ways with [[Roadrunner Records]] before signing a new deal with [[Rykodisc]], with whom he released ''[[Fang Bang]]'', the follow-up to \"Transylvania 90210\", on September 12, 2006.<ref>{{cite web|author=Dan Hammer |url=http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/wednesday-13-is-back/ |title=Blog Archive \u00bb Wednesday 13 is back |publisher=Metal Hammer |date=July 11, 2006 |accessdate=July 13, 2009}}</ref> The European version of the album contains a cover of [[Mot\u00f6rhead]]'s \"[[R.A.M.O.N.E.S.]]\" and the Japanese edition features the same track listing as the European CD, along with a bonus song entitled \"Good Day to Die\". The American edition features \"Burn the Flames\", a [[Roky Erickson]] cover, as its sole bonus track. ''[[Skeletons (Wednesday 13 album)|Skeletons]]'' was released on April 29, 2008, available exclusively through [[Hot Topic]] locations in the United States.

Out of the two songs, \"Xanaxtasy\" was previously released in the ''Bloodwork EP'' limited edition vinyl, and \"It's a Wonderful Lie\" was previously released on Wednesday's limited edition vinyl release ''From Here to the Hearse''. During May 2011, Poole released a remix album/EP titled ''Re-Animated'' and announced that a portion of all sales for the first month would be donated to the [[American Red Cross]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=157012|title=Wednesday 13: 'Re Animated' Track Listing Revealed |website=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|accessdate=January 31, 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn Wednesday, July 13, Wednesday released the track listing for ''Calling All Corpses'' via Bravewords.com.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bravewords.com/news/165468|title=WEDNESDAY 13 - Calling All Corpses Tracklisting Revealed|website=Bravewords.com|accessdate=January 31, 2015}}</ref> The album was released on October 11 in the US and October 10 overseas.

Wednesday 13 was in contact with former drummer Jeff Washam from Psycho Opera and was going to tour on the East Coast project. Scheduling prevented JW from doing the tour. The band released their first album in 2006, ''[[Highway to Hangovers]]'', and their second album, ''Long Way to the Bottom'', was released in 2009. In 2015 the band released their third album ''Off the Wagon on the Rocks''\n\n===Gunfire 76===\nPoole teamed up with [[Todd Youth]] (of [[The Chelsea Smiles]]) to write and record an album with a more glam rock sound and without any horror themes,<ref name=\"Wednesday 13's Official Myspace Blog\">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=75675077&blogId=494038524|title=Wednesday 13's Official Myspace Blog|website=Blogs.myspace.com|accessdate=October 27, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Frantik Gunfire 76 interview\">{{cite web|url=http://frantikmag.com/blog/2009/09/26/frantik-interview-gunfire-76/|title=Frantik Mag|website=Frantikmag.com|accessdate=January 31, 2015}}</ref> under the band name Gunfire 76.<ref name=\"Gunfire 76 Official Myspace\">{{cite web|url=http://www.myspace.com/gunfire76|title=Gunfire 76 Official Myspace|website=Myspace.com|accessdate=October 27, 2018}}</ref> Rough mixes of the album's title track, \"Casualties & Tragedies\", were uploaded onto the band's [[Myspace]] page on August 12, 2009 for the fans to get an idea of what the band sounded like.
