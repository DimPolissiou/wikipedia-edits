representing the god [[Thor]], c. 1000, [[National Museum of Iceland]].]]\nWhen Iceland was first settled by [[Norwegians]] (but also by some [[Swedes]] and people from the [[Norse activity in the British Isles|Norse settlements in Britain]]{{sfn|D'Angelo|2016|p=482}}) in the mid-9th century, approximately in 870,{{sfn|Cusack|1998|p=160}} it was inhabited by a small number of [[Irish people|Irish]] Christian [[anchorite]]s known as ''[[papar]]'' (singular ''papi''). When [[settlement of Iceland|Scandinavians began to arrive in larger numbers]], the anchorites left of their own or were driven out.{{sfn|Byock|1988|p=55}} The migration of Norwegians was partly in response to the politics of [[Harald Fairhair]], who was unifying [[Norway]] under a centralised monarchy.{{sfn|Cusack|1998|p=160}}\n\nThe first Icelanders, though accustomed to a society in which the monarch was essential for religious life, did not establish a new monarchy in the colony, but rather a yearly assembly of free men, the [[Althing]]. The \"[[thing (assembly)|things]]\" were assemblies of free men who governed Germanic societies, and they were led by a holy kingship. The Icelandic thing developed peculiar characteristics; in place of the loyalty to a holy king, the Icelanders established the loyalty to a law code, first composed by \u00dalflj\u00f3t who studied Norwegian laws.{{sfn|Cusack|1998|p=160}}\n\nIcelandic landowners (''landn\u00e1msmenn''{{sfn|Byock|1988|p=55}}) were organised into ''go\u00f0or\u00f0'' (\"god-word(s)\"), religio-political groups under the leadership of a ''[[gothi|go\u00f0i]]'' (\"god-man\"). The ''go\u00f0ar'' were part-time priests who officiated ritual sacrifices at the local temple and had some qualities of the Germanic kings; they organised local things and represented them at the Althing. \u00dalflj\u00f3t was chosen as the first Lawspeaker (''L\u00f6gs\u00f6guma\u00f0r''), who presided the Althing which met annually at [[Thingvellir]]. The religio-political organisation of early Iceland has been defined as \"pagan and anti-monarchic\", which distinguished it from other Germanic societies. Concerning other religious practices, the Icelanders followed Scandinavian norms; they built temples enshrining images of the gods.{{sfn|Cusack|1998|p=160}}\n\nThe religion was named ''Go\u00f0atr\u00fa'' or ''\u00c1satr\u00fa'', \"truth of the gods\". Icelanders worshipped ''[[landv\u00e6ttir]]'', local land spirits, and the gods of the common [[Old Norse religion|northern Germanic tradition]], within ''[[Heathen hof|hof]]'' and ''[[h\u00f6rgr|h\u00f6rgar]]''. The most popular deity was apparently [[Thor]], whom the Icelanders worshipped in the form of high pillars; poets worshipped [[Odin]], as highlighted by Hallfre\u00f0r Vandr\u00e6\u00f0ask\u00e1ld, the ''[[Landn\u00e1mab\u00f3k]]'' and the ''[[Eyrbyggja saga]]''. Other people worshipped [[Freyr]], as attested in the ''[[V\u00edga-Gl\u00fams saga]]''.{{sfn|Cusack|1998|p=161}}\n\n===10th\u201311th century: Christianisation===\n{{Main|Christianisation of Iceland}}\n{{Further|Germanic Christianity}}\n[[File:(9) \u00fe\u00edngmannakirkja.jpg|thumb|Early Icelandic churches maintained the style of [[Heathen hof]]s, often featuring dragons on the roof, such as in the case of the old church of [[Thingvellir]] (the current one goes back to 1859, while the steeple was rebuilt in 1907), built by initiative of King Olaf of Norway, who provided timber and the bell, to mark the official Christianisation of Iceland in the year 1000.]]\n[[File:Carved figure of Christ from Ufsir.jpg|thumb|Carved statue of [[Jesus Christ]], c. 1200, [[National Museum of Iceland]].]]\nApart from the Irish ''papar'', Christianity had been present in Iceland from the start even among the Germanic settlers. The ''Landn\u00e1mab\u00f3k'' gives the names of Christian settlers, including an influential woman named Aud the Deep-Minded. Icelanders generally tended to [[syncretism]], integrating [[Jesus Christ]] among their deities rather than converting to the Christian doctrine. For instance, Aud the Deep-Minded was among the baptised and devout Christians and she established a Christian cross on a hill, where she prayed; her kinsmen later regarded the site as sacred, and they built an ''\u00c1satr\u00fa'' temple there.{{sfn|Cusack|1998|p=161}} These first Christians were probably influenced by contact with Norse people in Britain, where Christianity already had a strong presence.{{sfn|Byock|1988|p=138}} Among the first settlers, the vast majority were worshippers of the Germanic gods, and organised Christianity probably died out in one or two generations.{{sfn|Byock|1988|p=138}} The syncretic attitude of the Icelanders made possible for the Germanic religion to survive and intermingle with Christianity even in later periods. It is recorded in the ''Eyrbyggja saga'' that as Norway was being Christianised, a pagan temple was dismantled there to be reassembled in Iceland.{{sfn|Cusack|1998|p=168}}\n\nThe adoption of Christianity\u2014which then was still identical to the [[Catholic Church]]\u2014as the [[state religion]] (''kristnitaka'', literally the \"taking of Christianity\"{{sfn|D'Angelo|2016|p=481}}), and therefore the formal conversion of the entire population, was decided by the Althing in 999/1000,{{sfn|Cusack|1998|p=161}} pushed by the [[king of Norway]], [[Olaf Tryggvason]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Jochens|first=Jenny|title=Late and Peaceful: Iceland's Conversion Through Arbitration in 1000|journal=Speculum|number=74|year=1999|pages=621\u2013655|doi=10.2307/2886763|jstor=2886763}}</ref> In that year, Christianity was still a minority in Iceland, while the belief in the Germanic religion was strong. However, some Christians had acquired high positions in the ''go\u00f0or\u00f0'' system and therefore considerable power in the Althing.{{sfn|Cusack|1998|p=161}}\n\nChristian missionaries began to be active in Iceland by 980. One of them was the Icelandic native [[Thorvald Konradsson]], who had been baptised on the continent by the [[Saxons|Saxon]] bishop Fridrek, with whom he preached the gospel in Iceland in 981, converting only Thorvald's father Konrad and his family. They were unsuccessful and even had a clash with pagans at the Althing, killing two men. After the event, in 986 Fridrek returned to [[Saxony]] while Thorvald embarked for [[Viking expansion|Viking expeditions]] in [[Eastern Europe]]. Among the other proselytisers, King Olaf of Norway sent the Icelandic native [[Stefnir Thorgilsson]] in 995\u2013996 and the Saxon priest [[Thangbrand]] in 997\u2013999. Both the missions were unsuccessful: Stefnir violently destroyed temples and ancestral shrines, leading the Althing to enact a law against Christians\u2014who were declared ''fr\u00e6ndaskomm'', a \"disgrace on one's kin\", and could now be denounced\u2014and to outlaw Stefnir, who returned to Norway; Thangbrand, a learnt but violent man, succeeded in converting some important families, but he also had many opponents, and, when he killed a poet\u2014who had composed verses against him\u2014, he was outlawed and he too went back to Norway.{{sfn|D'Angelo|2016|p=482}}\n\nAt this point, Olaf Tryggvason suspended Iceland's trade with Norway (a concrete threat for Icelandic economy) and threatened to kill Icelanders residing in Norway (who were for the most part sons and relatives of prominent ''go\u00f0ar'') as long as Iceland remained a pagan country. Iceland sent a delegation, belonging to the Christian faction, to obtain the release of the hostages and promise the conversion of the country to Christianity. Meanwhile, in Iceland the situation was worsening, as the two religious factions had divided the country and a civil war was about to break out. However, the mediation of the Althing, presided by the lawspeaker [[Thorgeir Thorkelsson]], thwarted the conflict.{{sfn|D'Angelo|2016|p=482}} Thorgeir was trusted by both the religious factions, and he was given the responsibility to decide whether Icelanders would have converted to Christianity or would have remained faithful to the Germanic religion of their ancestors. After one day and one night, he decided that, in order to keep peace, the population had to be united under one law and one religion, Christianity, and all the non-Christians among the population would have received baptism. At first, it was maintained the right for people to sacrifice to the old gods in private, though it was punishable if witnesses were provided. A few years later, these provisions allowing private cults were abolished.{{sfn|D'Angelo|2016|p=483}}\n\nThe decision of the Althing was a turning point; before that, it was difficult for individuals to convert to Christianity, since it would have meant to abandon the traditions of one's own kin, and would have been seen as ''\u00e6ttarspillar''\u2014\"destruction of kinship\".{{sfn|Cusack|1998|p=167}} Despite the official Christianisation, the old Germanic religion persisted for long time, as proven by the literature produced by [[Snorri Sturluson]]\u2014himself a Christian\u2014and other authors in the 13th century, who composed the ''[[Prose Edda]]'' and the ''[[Poetic Edda]]''.{{sfn|Cusack|1998|pp=162, 168}} After the conversion, members of the ''go\u00f0or\u00f0'' often became Christian priests and bishops. The first consecrated bishop in Iceland was \u00cdsleif Gizursson, who from 1057 to his death in 1080 was the bishop of [[Sk\u00e1lholt]]. He is credited with having instituted a tithe system which made the Icelandic church financially independent and strengthened Christianity.{{sfn|Cusack|1998|p=167}}\n\n===16th century: Protestant Reformation===\n{{Main|Icelandic Reformation}}\n{{Further|Reformation in Denmark\u2013Norway and Holstein}}\n[[File:Holar church.jpg|thumb|The Cathedral of [[H\u00f3lar]], and [[H\u00f3lar University College]].]]\n[[File:(Baumg1889) Kirchliche Einteilung (Bist\u00fcmer) Islands im Mittelalter.jpg|thumb|1889 map showing the location in Iceland of the two major Catholic bishoprics, and of the Catholic monasteries under their jurisdiction, before the [[Protestant Reformation]].]]\nThe last two Catholic bishops of Iceland were \u00d8gmundur P\u00e1llson of [[Sk\u00e1lholt]] and J\u00f3n Arason of [[H\u00f3lar]]. J\u00f3n was a poet of some importance and was married with many children, a usual thing among the clergy in Iceland. The two bishops, who were not well versed in theology but were men of great power, were in conflict with one another and threatened open conflict. At the Althing of 1526 they came with their own armed contingents, though they reconciled because of the threat posed by a new, common enemy, the spread of [[Lutheranism]].{{sfn|Elton|1990|p=154}}\n\nLutheran pamphlets were introduced in Iceland through trade with [[Germany]]. In 1533, the Althing ordained that \"all shall continue in the Holy Faith and the Law of God, which God has given to us, and which the Holy Fathers have confirmed\". Among the first Lutherans there was [[Oddur Gottsk\u00e1lksson]], who had converted to Lutheranism while living on the continent for many years. When he went back to Iceland, he became the secretary of the bishop of Sk\u00e1lholt and translated the [[New Testament]] into the [[Icelandic language]].{{sfn|Elton|1990|p=155}}\n\nThe most important figure in early Icelandic Lutheranism was, however, [[Gissur Einarsson]], who during a period of study in Germany learned about the Reformation. In 1536, he became assistant at the Sk\u00e1lholt bishopric, though he still did not formally embrace Lutheranism. When Lutheranism became the state religion of [[Denmark]] and Norway under king [[Christian III of Denmark|Christian III]], the king tried to convert Iceland too. In 1538, the \"Church Ordinance\" (the royal invitation to convert) was put before the two bishops \u00d8gmundur and J\u00f3n at the Althing, but it was rejected. Then Christian III ordered the dissolution of the [[monastery|monasteries]]. Bishop \u00d8gmundur, now old and almost blind, chose Gissur Einarsson as his successor. He was examined by theologians in [[Copenhagen]] and in 1540 the king appointed him as the superintendent of Sk\u00e1lholt. Gissur was only 25 years old and it was difficult for him to maintain power, especially as he was opposed by the clergy and even by the old bishop. A royal emissary was sent to uphold the ordinance, and \u00d8gmundur was arrested and died on the way to Denmark. The ordinance was accepted in Sk\u00e1lholt, but rejected by J\u00f3n Arason in H\u00f3lar. Bishop Gissur, who was ordained by the Danish bishop [[Peder Palladius]], reorganised the church in his diocese according to Lutheran principles, including the suppression of Catholic ceremonies and the exhortation of clergy marriage. He entrusted Oddur Gottsk\u00e1lksson with the translation of German sermons, and he himself translated parts of the [[Old Testament]] and the Church Ordinance.{{sfn|Elton|1990|p=155}}\n\nGissur Einarsson died in 1548 and J\u00f3n Arason took possession of the Sk\u00e1lholt diocese, even though the clergy opposed him. He also imprisoned Gissur's appointed successor. J\u00f3n Arason was consequently outlawed by the king, he was arrested with two of his sons, and all three were executed in November 1550.{{sfn|Elton|1990|p=155}} In 1552 the H\u00f3lar diocese also accepted the Church Ordinance. Institutional opposition to the Reformation had now vanished, so that church properties were secularised and churches and monasteries were plundered. However, it took many decades for Lutheranism to be firmly established in Iceland. Church manuals and hymnals were in bad Danish translations, and new schools had to be set up in cathedral towns to train the Lutheran clergy. Bishop Palladius was in charge of the development of the Icelandic Lutheran church in those early years. The able and energetic Gudbrandur Thorl\u00e1ksson, bishop of H\u00f3lar from 1571 to 1627, devoted his energies in improving church literature, clergy training and community education. In 1584 the first Icelandic translation of the [[Bible]] was published.{{sfn|Elton|1990|p=156}}\n\n===20th\u201321st century: Decline of Christianity and rise of new religions===\n{{Further|Heathenry (new religious movement)|Zuism}}\n[[File:Zuist Church logo (December 2015).svg|thumb|Logo of the Zuist Church used for the protest in December 2015.]]\nSince the end of the 19th century, Iceland has been more open to new religious ideas than many other European countries.{{sfn|Christiano|Swatos|Kivisto|2002|p=331}} In the 19th and early 20th centuries, religious life in Iceland, still mostly within the Christian establishment, was influenced by the spread of [[spiritualism (beliefs)|spiritualist]] beliefs.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Swatos|first1=William H.|last2=Gissurarson|first2=Loftur Reimar|title=Icelandic Spiritualism: Mediumship and Modernity in Iceland|year=1997|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=1412825776}} ''passim''.</ref> [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] was introduced in Iceland around 1900, and in 1920 the Icelandic Theosophists formally organised as an independent branch of the international Theosophical movement, though within the fold of the Lutheran belief and led by a Lutheran pastor, S\u00e9ra Jakob Kristinsson.{{sfn|Fell|1999|p=250}}\n\nSince the late 20th century there has been a rapid diversification of religious life in the country. The most notable phenomenon has been a rise of [[modern Paganism|Neopagan religions]], especially [[Heathenry (new religious movement)|Heathenry]], in Iceland also called ''\u00c1satr\u00fa'', \"truth of the gods\", the return to Germanic religion. This may have been assisted by the [[Icelandic language]]'s literary tradition that predates the island's conversion to Christianity, the [[Edda]]s and the [[Saga]]s, which are well known by most Icelanders, providing an unbroken link with the pagan past.{{sfn|Christiano|Swatos|Kivisto|2002|p=331}}\n\nIn 1972, four men proposed to found an organisation for the revitalisation of the pre-Christian northern Germanic religion. They founded ''[[\u00c1satr\u00faarf\u00e9lagi\u00f0]]'' (the \u00c1satr\u00fa Society) and asked the Ministry of Justice and Ecclesiastical Affairs to recognise the new organisation, giving its chief priest the same legal status as a Christian pastor. In the autumn of the same year, they asked to be registered, and by the spring of 1973 ''\u00c1satr\u00fa'' had become a recognised religion.{{sfn|Christiano|Swatos|Kivisto|2002|p=331}}\n\nIn the early 2010s, [[Zuism]], a revival of the [[Sumerian religion]], was founded in Iceland and formally registered in 2013. In late 2015, the Board of Directors of the Zuist Church was hijacked by people who were unrelated to the movement, and under the new leadership Zuism was turned into a medium for a protest against the state church and the Icelandic church tax (''s\u00f3knargjald''). Zuism, unlike other religions, promised to share among its adherents the money it receives from the tax, so that in a few weeks thousands of people joined the church. After a legal struggle, the original directors were reinstated as the leaders of the movement, and by October 2017, after two years of frozen activity, the case was closed allowing the church to dispose of its taxes.<ref name=zuism.is-24Oct>{{cite web|title=Yfirl\u00fdsing fr\u00e1 \u00c1g\u00fasti Arnari \u00c1g\u00fastsssyni, forst\u00f6\u00f0umanni tr\u00faf\u00e9lagsins Zuism|url=http://zuism.is/2017/10/24/yfirlysing-fra-agusti-arnari-agustsssyni-forstodumanni-trufelagsins-zuism/|website=Z\u00faistar \u00e1 \u00cdslandi|date=24 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171220221401/http://zuism.is/2017/10/24/yfirlysing-fra-agusti-arnari-agustsssyni-forstodumanni-trufelagsins-zuism/|archive-date=20 December 2017}}</ref> This church has kept the principle of funds' redistribution among members, which is called ''amargi''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Amargi (Endurgrei\u00f0sla S\u00f3knargjalda)|url=http://zuism.is/endurgreidsla-soknargjalda/|website=Z\u00faistar \u00e1 \u00cdslandi|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171229135343/http://zuism.is/endurgreidsla-soknargjalda/|archive-date=29 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Religions and life stances==\n[[File:Sk\u00e1lholt - panoramio.jpg|thumb|The Cathedral of [[Sk\u00e1lholt]], the first church which converted to [[Lutheranism]] in Iceland.]]\nAs of 2019, 80.17% of the Icelanders were affiliated with some religion officially recognised by the government and listed in the [[Registers Iceland|civil registry]], 13.02% were members of some unspecified other religions not registered within the civil registry, and 6.96% were unaffiliated with any religion.<ref name=\"StatisticsIceland\"/>\n\n===Christianity===\nAs of 2019, 76.84% of the Icelandic people were registered as [[Christians]], most of them belonging to the Church of Iceland and minor Lutheran free churches.<ref name=\"StatisticsIceland\"/> Catholics were 3.92%, and a further 7.77% of the Icelanders were adherents of some other Christian denomination.<ref name=\"StatisticsIceland\"/>\n\n====Lutheranism====\n{{Main|Church of Iceland}}\nIn 2019, 65.15% of the Icelanders were registered as members of the national Church of Iceland.

representing the god [[Thor]], c. 1000, [[National Museum of Iceland]].]]\nWhen Iceland was first settled by [[Norwegians]] (but also by some [[Swedes]] and people from the [[Norse activity in the British Isles|Norse settlements in Britain]]{{sfn|D'Angelo|2016|p=482}}) in the mid-9th century, approximately in 870,{{sfn|Cusack|1998|p=160}} it was inhabited by a small number of [[Irish people|Irish]] Christian [[anchorite]]s known as ''[[papar]]'' (singular ''papi''). When [[settlement of Iceland|Scandinavians began to arrive in larger numbers]], the anchorites left of their own or were driven out.{{sfn|Byock|1988|p=55}} The migration of Norwegians was partly in response to the politics of [[Harald Fairhair]], who was unifying [[Norway]] under a centralised monarchy.{{sfn|Cusack|1998|p=160}}\n\nThe first Icelanders, though accustomed to a society in which the monarch was essential for religious life, did not establish a new monarchy in the colony, but rather a yearly assembly of free men, the [[Althing]]. The \"[[thing (assembly)|things]]\" were assemblies of free men who governed Germanic societies, and they were led by a holy kingship. The Icelandic thing developed peculiar characteristics; in place of the loyalty to a holy king, the Icelanders established the loyalty to a law code, first composed by \u00dalflj\u00f3t who studied Norwegian laws.{{sfn|Cusack|1998|p=160}}\n\nIcelandic landowners (''landn\u00e1msmenn''{{sfn|Byock|1988|p=55}}) were organised into ''go\u00f0or\u00f0'' (\"god-word(s)\"), religio-political groups under the leadership of a ''[[gothi|go\u00f0i]]'' (\"god-man\"). The ''go\u00f0ar'' were part-time priests who officiated ritual sacrifices at the local temple and had some qualities of the Germanic kings; they organised local things and represented them at the Althing. \u00dalflj\u00f3t was chosen as the first Lawspeaker (''L\u00f6gs\u00f6guma\u00f0r''), who presided the Althing which met annually at [[Thingvellir]]. The religio-political organisation of early Iceland has been defined as \"pagan and anti-monarchic\", which distinguished it from other Germanic societies. Concerning other religious practices, the Icelanders followed Scandinavian norms; they built temples enshrining images of the gods.{{sfn|Cusack|1998|p=160}}\n\nThe religion was named ''Go\u00f0atr\u00fa'' or ''\u00c1satr\u00fa'', \"truth of the gods\". Icelanders worshipped ''[[landv\u00e6ttir]]'', local land spirits, and the gods of the common [[Old Norse religion|northern Germanic tradition]], within ''[[Heathen hof|hof]]'' and ''[[h\u00f6rgr|h\u00f6rgar]]''. The most popular deity was apparently [[Thor]], whom the Icelanders worshipped in the form of high pillars; poets worshipped [[Odin]], as highlighted by Hallfre\u00f0r Vandr\u00e6\u00f0ask\u00e1ld, the ''[[Landn\u00e1mab\u00f3k]]'' and the ''[[Eyrbyggja saga]]''. Other people worshipped [[Freyr]], as attested in the ''[[V\u00edga-Gl\u00fams saga]]''.{{sfn|Cusack|1998|p=161}}\n\n===10th\u201311th century: Christianisation===\n{{Main|Christianisation of Iceland}}\n{{Further|Germanic Christianity}}\n[[File:(9) \u00fe\u00edngmannakirkja.jpg|thumb|Early Icelandic churches maintained the style of [[Heathen hof]]s, often featuring dragons on the roof, such as in the case of the old church of [[Thingvellir]] (the current one goes back to 1859, while the steeple was rebuilt in 1907), built by initiative of King Olaf of Norway, who provided timber and the bell, to mark the official Christianisation of Iceland in the year 1000.]]\n[[File:Carved figure of Christ from Ufsir.jpg|thumb|Carved statue of [[Jesus Christ]], c. 1200, [[National Museum of Iceland]].]]\nApart from the Irish ''papar'', Christianity had been present in Iceland from the start even among the Germanic settlers. The ''Landn\u00e1mab\u00f3k'' gives the names of Christian settlers, including an influential woman named Aud the Deep-Minded. Icelanders generally tended to [[syncretism]], integrating [[Jesus Christ]] among their deities rather than converting to the Christian doctrine. For instance, Aud the Deep-Minded was among the baptised and devout Christians and she established a Christian cross on a hill, where she prayed; her kinsmen later regarded the site as sacred, and they built an ''\u00c1satr\u00fa'' temple there.{{sfn|Cusack|1998|p=161}} These first Christians were probably influenced by contact with Norse people in Britain, where Christianity already had a strong presence.{{sfn|Byock|1988|p=138}} Among the first settlers, the vast majority were worshippers of the Germanic gods, and organised Christianity probably died out in one or two generations.{{sfn|Byock|1988|p=138}} The syncretic attitude of the Icelanders made possible for the Germanic religion to survive and intermingle with Christianity even in later periods. It is recorded in the ''Eyrbyggja saga'' that as Norway was being Christianised, a pagan temple was dismantled there to be reassembled in Iceland.{{sfn|Cusack|1998|p=168}}\n\nThe adoption of Christianity\u2014which then was still identical to the [[Catholic Church]]\u2014as the [[state religion]] (''kristnitaka'', literally the \"taking of Christianity\"{{sfn|D'Angelo|2016|p=481}}), and therefore the formal conversion of the entire population, was decided by the Althing in 999/1000,{{sfn|Cusack|1998|p=161}} pushed by the [[king of Norway]], [[Olaf Tryggvason]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Jochens|first=Jenny|title=Late and Peaceful: Iceland's Conversion Through Arbitration in 1000|journal=Speculum|number=74|year=1999|pages=621\u2013655|doi=10.2307/2886763|jstor=2886763}}</ref> In that year, Christianity was still a minority in Iceland, while the belief in the Germanic religion was strong. However, some Christians had acquired high positions in the ''go\u00f0or\u00f0'' system and therefore considerable power in the Althing.{{sfn|Cusack|1998|p=161}}\n\nChristian missionaries began to be active in Iceland by 980. One of them was the Icelandic native [[Thorvald Konradsson]], who had been baptised on the continent by the [[Saxons|Saxon]] bishop Fridrek, with whom he preached the gospel in Iceland in 981, converting only Thorvald's father Konrad and his family. They were unsuccessful and even had a clash with pagans at the Althing, killing two men. After the event, in 986 Fridrek returned to [[Saxony]] while Thorvald embarked for [[Viking expansion|Viking expeditions]] in [[Eastern Europe]]. Among the other proselytisers, King Olaf of Norway sent the Icelandic native [[Stefnir Thorgilsson]] in 995\u2013996 and the Saxon priest [[Thangbrand]] in 997\u2013999. Both the missions were unsuccessful: Stefnir violently destroyed temples and ancestral shrines, leading the Althing to enact a law against Christians\u2014who were declared ''fr\u00e6ndaskomm'', a \"disgrace on one's kin\", and could now be denounced\u2014and to outlaw Stefnir, who returned to Norway; Thangbrand, a learnt but violent man, succeeded in converting some important families, but he also had many opponents, and, when he killed a poet\u2014who had composed verses against him\u2014, he was outlawed and he too went back to Norway.{{sfn|D'Angelo|2016|p=482}}\n\nAt this point, Olaf Tryggvason suspended Iceland's trade with Norway (a concrete threat for Icelandic economy) and threatened to kill Icelanders residing in Norway (who were for the most part sons and relatives of prominent ''go\u00f0ar'') as long as Iceland remained a pagan country. Iceland sent a delegation, belonging to the Christian faction, to obtain the release of the hostages and promise the conversion of the country to Christianity. Meanwhile, in Iceland the situation was worsening, as the two religious factions had divided the country and a civil war was about to break out. However, the mediation of the Althing, presided by the lawspeaker [[Thorgeir Thorkelsson]], thwarted the conflict.{{sfn|D'Angelo|2016|p=482}} Thorgeir was trusted by both the religious factions, and he was given the responsibility to decide whether Icelanders would have converted to Christianity or would have remained faithful to the Germanic religion of their ancestors. After one day and one night, he decided that, in order to keep peace, the population had to be united under one law and one religion, Christianity, and all the non-Christians among the population would have received baptism. At first, it was maintained the right for people to sacrifice to the old gods in private, though it was punishable if witnesses were provided. A few years later, these provisions allowing private cults were abolished.{{sfn|D'Angelo|2016|p=483}}\n\nThe decision of the Althing was a turning point; before that, it was difficult for individuals to convert to Christianity, since it would have meant to abandon the traditions of one's own kin, and would have been seen as ''\u00e6ttarspillar''\u2014\"destruction of kinship\".{{sfn|Cusack|1998|p=167}} Despite the official Christianisation, the old Germanic religion persisted for long time, as proven by the literature produced by [[Snorri Sturluson]]\u2014himself a Christian\u2014and other authors in the 13th century, who composed the ''[[Prose Edda]]'' and the ''[[Poetic Edda]]''.{{sfn|Cusack|1998|pp=162, 168}} After the conversion, members of the ''go\u00f0or\u00f0'' often became Christian priests and bishops. The first consecrated bishop in Iceland was \u00cdsleif Gizursson, who from 1057 to his death in 1080 was the bishop of [[Sk\u00e1lholt]]. He is credited with having instituted a tithe system which made the Icelandic church financially independent and strengthened Christianity.{{sfn|Cusack|1998|p=167}}\n\n===16th century: Protestant Reformation===\n{{Main|Icelandic Reformation}}\n{{Further|Reformation in Denmark\u2013Norway and Holstein}}\n[[File:Holar church.jpg|thumb|The Cathedral of [[H\u00f3lar]], and [[H\u00f3lar University College]].]]\n[[File:(Baumg1889) Kirchliche Einteilung (Bist\u00fcmer) Islands im Mittelalter.jpg|thumb|1889 map showing the location in Iceland of the two major Catholic bishoprics, and of the Catholic monasteries under their jurisdiction, before the [[Protestant Reformation]].]]\nThe last two Catholic bishops of Iceland were \u00d8gmundur P\u00e1llson of [[Sk\u00e1lholt]] and J\u00f3n Arason of [[H\u00f3lar]]. J\u00f3n was a poet of some importance and was married with many children, a usual thing among the clergy in Iceland. The two bishops, who were not well versed in theology but were men of great power, were in conflict with one another and threatened open conflict. At the Althing of 1526 they came with their own armed contingents, though they reconciled because of the threat posed by a new, common enemy, the spread of [[Lutheranism]].{{sfn|Elton|1990|p=154}}\n\nLutheran pamphlets were introduced in Iceland through trade with [[Germany]]. In 1533, the Althing ordained that \"all shall continue in the Holy Faith and the Law of God, which God has given to us, and which the Holy Fathers have confirmed\". Among the first Lutherans there was [[Oddur Gottsk\u00e1lksson]], who had converted to Lutheranism while living on the continent for many years. When he went back to Iceland, he became the secretary of the bishop of Sk\u00e1lholt and translated the [[New Testament]] into the [[Icelandic language]].{{sfn|Elton|1990|p=155}}\n\nThe most important figure in early Icelandic Lutheranism was, however, [[Gissur Einarsson]], who during a period of study in Germany learned about the Reformation. In 1536, he became assistant at the Sk\u00e1lholt bishopric, though he still did not formally embrace Lutheranism. When Lutheranism became the state religion of [[Denmark]] and Norway under king [[Christian III of Denmark|Christian III]], the king tried to convert Iceland too. In 1538, the \"Church Ordinance\" (the royal invitation to convert) was put before the two bishops \u00d8gmundur and J\u00f3n at the Althing, but it was rejected. Then Christian III ordered the dissolution of the [[monastery|monasteries]]. Bishop \u00d8gmundur, now old and almost blind, chose Gissur Einarsson as his successor. He was examined by theologians in [[Copenhagen]] and in 1540 the king appointed him as the superintendent of Sk\u00e1lholt. Gissur was only 25 years old and it was difficult for him to maintain power, especially as he was opposed by the clergy and even by the old bishop. A royal emissary was sent to uphold the ordinance, and \u00d8gmundur was arrested and died on the way to Denmark. The ordinance was accepted in Sk\u00e1lholt, but rejected by J\u00f3n Arason in H\u00f3lar. Bishop Gissur, who was ordained by the Danish bishop [[Peder Palladius]], reorganised the church in his diocese according to Lutheran principles, including the suppression of Catholic ceremonies and the exhortation of clergy marriage. He entrusted Oddur Gottsk\u00e1lksson with the translation of German sermons, and he himself translated parts of the [[Old Testament]] and the Church Ordinance.{{sfn|Elton|1990|p=155}}\n\nGissur Einarsson died in 1548 and J\u00f3n Arason took possession of the Sk\u00e1lholt diocese, even though the clergy opposed him. He also imprisoned Gissur's appointed successor. J\u00f3n Arason was consequently outlawed by the king, he was arrested with two of his sons, and all three were executed in November 1550.{{sfn|Elton|1990|p=155}} In 1552 the H\u00f3lar diocese also accepted the Church Ordinance. Institutional opposition to the Reformation had now vanished, so that church properties were secularised and churches and monasteries were plundered. However, it took many decades for Lutheranism to be firmly established in Iceland. Church manuals and hymnals were in bad Danish translations, and new schools had to be set up in cathedral towns to train the Lutheran clergy. Bishop Palladius was in charge of the development of the Icelandic Lutheran church in those early years. The able and energetic Gudbrandur Thorl\u00e1ksson, bishop of H\u00f3lar from 1571 to 1627, devoted his energies in improving church literature, clergy training and community education. In 1584 the first Icelandic translation of the [[Bible]] was published.{{sfn|Elton|1990|p=156}}\n\n===20th\u201321st century: Decline of Christianity and rise of new religions===\n{{Further|Heathenry (new religious movement)|Zuism}}\n[[File:Zuist Church logo (December 2015).svg|thumb|Logo of the Zuist Church used for the protest in December 2015.]]\nSince the end of the 19th century, Iceland has been more open to new religious ideas than many other European countries.{{sfn|Christiano|Swatos|Kivisto|2002|p=331}} In the 19th and early 20th centuries, religious life in Iceland, still mostly within the Christian establishment, was influenced by the spread of [[spiritualism (beliefs)|spiritualist]] beliefs.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Swatos|first1=William H.|last2=Gissurarson|first2=Loftur Reimar|title=Icelandic Spiritualism: Mediumship and Modernity in Iceland|year=1997|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=1412825776}} ''passim''.</ref> [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] was introduced in Iceland around 1900, and in 1920 the Icelandic Theosophists formally organised as an independent branch of the international Theosophical movement, though within the fold of the Lutheran belief and led by a Lutheran pastor, S\u00e9ra Jakob Kristinsson.{{sfn|Fell|1999|p=250}}\n\nSince the late 20th century there has been a rapid diversification of religious life in the country. The most notable phenomenon has been a rise of [[modern Paganism|Neopagan religions]], especially [[Heathenry (new religious movement)|Heathenry]], in Iceland also called ''\u00c1satr\u00fa'', \"truth of the gods\", the return to Germanic religion. This may have been assisted by the [[Icelandic language]]'s literary tradition that predates the island's conversion to Christianity, the [[Edda]]s and the [[Saga]]s, which are well known by most Icelanders, providing an unbroken link with the pagan past.{{sfn|Christiano|Swatos|Kivisto|2002|p=331}}\n\nIn 1972, four men proposed to found an organisation for the revitalisation of the pre-Christian northern Germanic religion. They founded ''[[\u00c1satr\u00faarf\u00e9lagi\u00f0]]'' (the \u00c1satr\u00fa Society) and asked the Ministry of Justice and Ecclesiastical Affairs to recognise the new organisation, giving its chief priest the same legal status as a Christian pastor.

Zuism, unlike other religions, promised to share among its adherents the money it receives from the tax, so that in a few weeks thousands of people joined the church. After a legal struggle, the original directors were reinstated as the leaders of the movement, and by October 2017, after two years of frozen activity, the case was closed allowing the church to dispose of its taxes.<ref name=zuism.is-24Oct>{{cite web|title=Yfirl\u00fdsing fr\u00e1 \u00c1g\u00fasti Arnari \u00c1g\u00fastsssyni, forst\u00f6\u00f0umanni tr\u00faf\u00e9lagsins Zuism|url=http://zuism.is/2017/10/24/yfirlysing-fra-agusti-arnari-agustsssyni-forstodumanni-trufelagsins-zuism/|website=Z\u00faistar \u00e1 \u00cdslandi|date=24 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171220221401/http://zuism.is/2017/10/24/yfirlysing-fra-agusti-arnari-agustsssyni-forstodumanni-trufelagsins-zuism/|archive-date=20 December 2017}}</ref> This church has kept the principle of funds' redistribution among members, which is called ''amargi''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Amargi (Endurgrei\u00f0sla S\u00f3knargjalda)|url=http://zuism.is/endurgreidsla-soknargjalda/|website=Z\u00faistar \u00e1 \u00cdslandi|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171229135343/http://zuism.is/endurgreidsla-soknargjalda/|archive-date=29 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Religions and life stances==\n[[File:Sk\u00e1lholt - panoramio.jpg|thumb|The Cathedral of [[Sk\u00e1lholt]], the first church which converted to [[Lutheranism]] in Iceland.]]\nAs of 2019, 80.17% of the Icelanders were affiliated with some religion officially recognised by the government and listed in the [[Registers Iceland|civil registry]], 13.02% were members of some unspecified other religions not registered within the civil registry, and 6.96% were unaffiliated with any religion.<ref name=\"StatisticsIceland\"/>\n\n===Christianity===\nAs of 2019, 76.84% of the Icelandic people were registered as [[Christians]], most of them belonging to the Church of Iceland and minor Lutheran free churches.<ref name=\"StatisticsIceland\"/> Catholics were 3.92%, and a further 7.77% of the Icelanders were adherents of some other Christian denomination.<ref name=\"StatisticsIceland\"/>\n\n====Lutheranism====\n{{Main|Church of Iceland}}\nIn 2019, 65.15% of the Icelanders were registered as members of the national Church of Iceland.
