Played by [[Darren Criss]], Blaine was introduced in the [[Never Been Kissed (Glee)|sixth episode]] of the [[Glee (season 2)|second season]] as the [[openly gay]] lead singer of the Dalton Academy Warblers, a rival show choir to New Directions, the show's primary musical group. Blaine initially served as a mentor for New Directions member [[Kurt Hummel]] ([[Chris Colfer]]). Chemistry between the two, combined with fan support for the couple, led series co-creator [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]] to pair them romantically. Their relationship has been well received by critics, and they have been named \"one of the most beloved TV couples of the millennium\" by Jarett Wieselman of the ''[[New York Post]]''.<ref name=\"NYP\"/> At the beginning of the third season, Blaine transfers to McKinley High and joins New Directions; concurrently, Criss was promoted from recurring guest star to the show's main cast.\n\nCriss auditioned for ''Glee'' several times before being cast as Blaine, including for the lead role of [[Finn Hudson]]. He believed he would be ill-suited to that character, but identifies with Blaine, having been raised among the \"gay community\".<ref name=\"kurt's new squeeze\"/> He plays Blaine as charismatic and confident, and finds his youthful self-acceptance a fitting counterpoint to common media portrayals of gay characters.\n\nAs the Warblers' lead vocalist and subsequent New Directions member, Blaine has performed a number of songs on the television series. His first, a [[cover version]] of \"[[Teenage Dream (Katy Perry song)|Teenage Dream]]\" by [[Katy Perry]], became the fastest-selling ''Glee'' single, reached number eight on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and was certified gold in the U.S.<ref name=\"bill20101127\"/><ref name=\"riaa\"/> Tracks by the Warblers have sold over 1.3&nbsp;million copies. The songs became popular enough to warrant a Warbler soundtrack album, ''[[Glee: The Music Presents the Warblers]]''. Blaine has received mostly positive reviews from critics; Criss has been awarded a Rising Star accolade from the Gay and Lesbian Entertainment Critics Association for his portrayal. While the Blaine\u2013Kurt (\"Klaine\") relationship has been met with acclaim, an episode storyline in which Blaine questioned his sexuality attracted negative reviews for undermining his previous characterization as a confident gay teenager.\n\n==Storylines==\n===Season 2===\nBlaine Anderson is introduced in the episode \"[[Never Been Kissed (Glee)|Never Been Kissed]]\" as the lead soloist of the Dalton Academy Warblers [[a cappella]] musical group, and honestly changed Glee for the better. He meets [[Kurt Hummel]] ([[Chris Colfer]]), a member of the rival [[glee club]] New Directions. When Kurt asks if Blaine is gay, Blaine matter-of-factly says he is; Kurt tells Blaine that he is being bullied at school for being gay, and Blaine reveals that he too was harassed at his old school, so he transferred to Dalton Academy, which enforces a no-bullying policy. Blaine befriends Kurt, and helps him stand up to his tormentor, [[Dave Karofsky]] ([[Max Adler (actor)|Max Adler]]).<ref name=\"NY\">{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2010/11/glee_recap_teenage_dream.html|title=Glee Recap: Teenage Dream|date=November 10, 2010|first=Rebecca|last=Milzoff|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|publisher=New York Media Holdings|accessdate=November 10, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"IGN-NeverBeenKissed\">{{cite web|url=http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/113/1133366p1.html|title=Glee: \"Never Been Kissed\" Review|date=November 10, 2010|first=Robert|last=Canning|publisher=IGN|accessdate=November 10, 2010}}</ref> When the threats and violence against Kurt reach a dangerous level, he transfers to Dalton Academy.<ref>{{cite web|first=Robert|last=Canning|url=http://au.tv.ign.com/articles/113/1136637p1.html|accessdate=2011-01-02|title=Glee: \"Furt\" Review&nbsp;\u2014 TV Review at IGN|work=[[IGN]]|date=November 24, 2010}}</ref> He falls in love with Blaine,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvfanatic.com/2010/12/glee-review-a-very-glee-christmas/|title=Glee Review: You're a Sweet One, Sue the Grinch|work=TV Fanatic|first=Matt|last=Richenthal|date=December 8, 2010|accessdate=April 20, 2011}}</ref> who is initially oblivious to Kurt's feelings even as their friendship grows.

They start off living together, but though they remain engaged, Blaine ultimately moves out because the two of them realize they still need their own space. The relationship between them goes through rocky patches, including Blaine's insecurity when Kurt becomes popular at school, and when an influential socialite and NYADA supporter hears Blaine perform and takes an interest in his future career, though she is not impressed by Kurt and ultimately tries to break them up, though she fails and ultimately supports them both. Their engagement is strengthened by having weathered these storms, and Blaine moves back in with Kurt.\n\n=== Season 6===\nBlaine returns to Lima after Kurt ended their engagement, having become so despondent that his schoolwork suffered and he was cut by NYADA. He becomes the coach of the Dalton Academy Warblers, and begins dating Dave Karofsky after a chance encounter at the local gay bar.

In \"[[The Hurt Locker, Part Two]]\", Sue, who \"ships Klaine\" and is desperate for Kurt and Blaine to reunite, locks them both in a fake elevator and refuses to let them leave until they kiss. After resisting for a great many hours, Blaine and Kurt share a passionate kiss, but do not reunite afterward. In \"[[Transitioning (Glee)|Transitioning]]\", Blaine sings a duet with Kurt, \"Somebody Loves You\", and afterward, kisses Kurt. The following day, Blaine, knowing that he is still in love with Kurt, breaks up with Karofsky; however, Kurt is still seeing an older man, Walter. In \"[[A Wedding (Glee)|A Wedding]]\", Kurt tells Walter that he is going to Brittany and Santana's wedding with Blaine, not him, and on Walter's advice, returns to Blaine; the two again become a couple. At the wedding, Brittany insists that Kurt and Blaine get married alongside her and Santana. Though skeptical at first, Kurt and Blaine agree and get married, with Burt officiating the joint ceremony. Dalton Academy burns down in \"[[The Rise and Fall of Sue Sylvester]]\", and the Warblers who transfer to McKinley are accepted into New Directions, with Blaine joining Rachel and Kurt as the coaches of the combined glee club. In the series finale, \"[[Dreams Come True (Glee)|Dreams Come True]]\", after New Directions wins Nationals, Blaine and Kurt leave for New York, with Blaine attending [[New York University|NYU]] and Kurt returning to NYADA along with a reinstated Rachel.

Played by [[Darren Criss]], Blaine was introduced in the [[Never Been Kissed (Glee)|sixth episode]] of the [[Glee (season 2)|second season]] as the [[openly gay]] lead singer of the Dalton Academy Warblers, a rival show choir to New Directions, the show's primary musical group. Blaine initially served as a mentor for New Directions member [[Kurt Hummel]] ([[Chris Colfer]]). Chemistry between the two, combined with fan support for the couple, led series co-creator [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]] to pair them romantically. Their relationship has been well received by critics, and they have been named \"one of the most beloved TV couples of the millennium\" by Jarett Wieselman of the ''[[New York Post]]''.<ref name=\"NYP\"/> At the beginning of the third season, Blaine transfers to McKinley High and joins New Directions; concurrently, Criss was promoted from recurring guest star to the show's main cast.\n\nCriss auditioned for ''Glee'' several times before being cast as Blaine, including for the lead role of [[Finn Hudson]]. He believed he would be ill-suited to that character, but identifies with Blaine, having been raised among the \"gay community\".<ref name=\"kurt's new squeeze\"/> He plays Blaine as charismatic and confident, and finds his youthful self-acceptance a fitting counterpoint to common media portrayals of gay characters.\n\nAs the Warblers' lead vocalist and subsequent New Directions member, Blaine has performed a number of songs on the television series. His first, a [[cover version]] of \"[[Teenage Dream (Katy Perry song)|Teenage Dream]]\" by [[Katy Perry]], became the fastest-selling ''Glee'' single, reached number eight on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and was certified gold in the U.S.<ref name=\"bill20101127\"/><ref name=\"riaa\"/> Tracks by the Warblers have sold over 1.3&nbsp;million copies. The songs became popular enough to warrant a Warbler soundtrack album, ''[[Glee: The Music Presents the Warblers]]''. Blaine has received mostly positive reviews from critics; Criss has been awarded a Rising Star accolade from the Gay and Lesbian Entertainment Critics Association for his portrayal. While the Blaine\u2013Kurt (\"Klaine\") relationship has been met with acclaim, an episode storyline in which Blaine questioned his sexuality attracted negative reviews for undermining his previous characterization as a confident gay teenager.\n\n==Storylines==\n===Season 2===\nBlaine Anderson is introduced in the episode \"[[Never Been Kissed (Glee)|Never Been Kissed]]\" as the lead soloist of the Dalton Academy Warblers [[a cappella]] musical group, and honestly changed Glee for the better. He meets [[Kurt Hummel]] ([[Chris Colfer]]), a member of the rival [[glee club]] New Directions. When Kurt asks if Blaine is gay, Blaine matter-of-factly says he is; Kurt tells Blaine that he is being bullied at school for being gay, and Blaine reveals that he too was harassed at his old school, so he transferred to Dalton Academy, which enforces a no-bullying policy. Blaine befriends Kurt, and helps him stand up to his tormentor, [[Dave Karofsky]] ([[Max Adler (actor)|Max Adler]]).<ref name=\"NY\">{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2010/11/glee_recap_teenage_dream.html|title=Glee Recap: Teenage Dream|date=November 10, 2010|first=Rebecca|last=Milzoff|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|publisher=New York Media Holdings|accessdate=November 10, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"IGN-NeverBeenKissed\">{{cite web|url=http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/113/1133366p1.html|title=Glee: \"Never Been Kissed\" Review|date=November 10, 2010|first=Robert|last=Canning|publisher=IGN|accessdate=November 10, 2010}}</ref> When the threats and violence against Kurt reach a dangerous level, he transfers to Dalton Academy.<ref>{{cite web|first=Robert|last=Canning|url=http://au.tv.ign.com/articles/113/1136637p1.html|accessdate=2011-01-02|title=Glee: \"Furt\" Review&nbsp;\u2014 TV Review at IGN|work=[[IGN]]|date=November 24, 2010}}</ref> He falls in love with Blaine,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvfanatic.com/2010/12/glee-review-a-very-glee-christmas/|title=Glee Review: You're a Sweet One, Sue the Grinch|work=TV Fanatic|first=Matt|last=Richenthal|date=December 8, 2010|accessdate=April 20, 2011}}</ref> who is initially oblivious to Kurt's feelings even as their friendship grows.

Blaine still wants to marry Kurt, and stages an elaborate and successful marriage proposal at Dalton Academy where he and Kurt first met, accompanied by New Directions, and all their rival show choir groups, including the Warblers. He auditions for NYADA and is accepted. New Directions comes in second at Nationals, and is disbanded by Sue for not being champions. Blaine graduates as class valedictorian, and then moves to New York to be with Kurt. They start off living together, but though they remain engaged, Blaine ultimately moves out because the two of them realize they still need their own space. The relationship between them goes through rocky patches, including Blaine's insecurity when Kurt becomes popular at school, and when an influential socialite and NYADA supporter hears Blaine perform and takes an interest in his future career, though she is not impressed by Kurt and ultimately tries to break them up, though she fails and ultimately supports them both. Their engagement is strengthened by having weathered these storms, and Blaine moves back in with Kurt.\n\n=== Season 6===\nBlaine returns to Lima after Kurt ended their engagement, having become so despondent that his schoolwork suffered and he was cut by NYADA. He becomes the coach of the Dalton Academy Warblers, and begins dating Dave Karofsky after a chance encounter at the local gay bar. Kurt, having realized he still loves Blaine and regretting that he ended the engagement, arranges for his NYADA off-campus semester to be in Lima, helping Rachel to coach a reinstated New Directions\u2014Will had left McKinley High to coach Vocal Adrenaline. Unfortunately, by the time he arrives, Blaine and Karofsky are already a couple, and there is further strain between Kurt and Blaine as coaches of rival show choirs. In \"[[The Hurt Locker, Part Two]]\", Sue, who \"ships Klaine\" and is desperate for Kurt and Blaine to reunite, locks them both in a fake elevator and refuses to let them leave until they kiss. After resisting for a great many hours, Blaine and Kurt share a passionate kiss, but do not reunite afterward. In \"[[Transitioning (Glee)|Transitioning]]\", Blaine sings a duet with Kurt, \"Somebody Loves You\", and afterward, kisses Kurt. The following day, Blaine, knowing that he is still in love with Kurt, breaks up with Karofsky; however, Kurt is still seeing an older man, Walter. In \"[[A Wedding (Glee)|A Wedding]]\", Kurt tells Walter that he is going to Brittany and Santana's wedding with Blaine, not him, and on Walter's advice, returns to Blaine; the two again become a couple. At the wedding, Brittany insists that Kurt and Blaine get married alongside her and Santana. Though skeptical at first, Kurt and Blaine agree and get married, with Burt officiating the joint ceremony. Dalton Academy burns down in \"[[The Rise and Fall of Sue Sylvester]]\", and the Warblers who transfer to McKinley are accepted into New Directions, with Blaine joining Rachel and Kurt as the coaches of the combined glee club. In the series finale, \"[[Dreams Come True (Glee)|Dreams Come True]]\", after New Directions wins Nationals, Blaine and Kurt leave for New York, with Blaine attending [[New York University|NYU]] and Kurt returning to NYADA along with a reinstated Rachel. The episode jumps ahead to 2020, and Blaine and Kurt are shown to be actors and a celebrity married couple; they also visit schools to entertain and talk about acceptance.

It changed its name to the '''British Union of Fascists and National Socialists''' in 1936 and, in 1937, to '''British Union'''. It was disbanded in 1940, after it was [[proscription|proscribed]] by the British government following the start of the [[Second World War]].\n\nThe BUF emerged in 1932 from the [[far-right politics in the United Kingdom|British far-right]], following the electoral defeat of its antecedent, the [[New Party (UK)|New Party]], in the [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931 general election]]. The BUF's foundation was initially met with popular support, and it attracted a sizeable following. The press baron [[Harold Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere|Lord Rothermere]] was a notable early supporter. As the party became increasingly radical, however, support declined. The [[Olympia, London|Olympia]] Rally of 1934, in which a number of anti-Fascist protestors were attacked by the paramilitary wing of the BUF, the [[Fascist Defence Force]], isolated the party from much of its following. The party's embrace of [[Nazi]]-style [[anti-semitism]] in 1936 led to increasingly violent anti-fascist disruptions, notably the 1936 [[Battle of Cable Street]] in [[London]]'s [[East End]]. The [[Public Order Act 1936]], which banned political uniforms and responded to increasing political violence, had a particularly strong effect on the BUF whose supporters were known as \"Blackshirts\" after the uniforms they wore.\n\nGrowing British hostility towards [[Nazi Germany]], with which the British press persistently associated the BUF, further contributed to the decline of the movement's membership. It was finally banned by the British government in 1940 after the start of the Second World War, amid suspicion that its remaining supporters might form a pro-Nazi \"[[fifth column]]\". A number of prominent BUF members were arrested and interned under [[Defence Regulation 18B]].\n\n==History==\n===Background===\n[[File:History of British Fascism.png|thumb|Flowchart showing the history of the early British fascist movement.]]\n[[Oswald Mosley]] was the youngest elected [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP before [[crossing the floor]] in 1922, joining first [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] and, shortly afterwards, the [[Independent Labour Party]]. He became a minister in [[Ramsay MacDonald]]'s [[Second MacDonald Ministry|Labour government]], advising on rising unemployment.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nIn 1930, Mosley issued his Mosley Memorandum, which fused [[protectionism]] with a proto-[[Keynesianism|Keynesian]] programme of policies designed to tackle the problem of unemployment, and he resigned from the Labour party soon after, in early 1931, when the plans were rejected. He immediately formed the [[New Party (UK)|New Party]], with policies based on his memorandum. Despite winning 16% of the vote at a by-election in [[Ashton-under-Lyne (UK Parliament constituency)|Ashton-under-Lyne]] in early 1931, however, the party failed to achieve any other electoral success.<ref>{{cite book|last= Powell|first= David|date=2004|title=British Politics,1910-35 - The Crisis of the Party System|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ch22p6goYYkC&pg=PA181&lpg=PA181&dq=BUF+50,000+members#v=onepage|location=|publisher=Routledge|isbn= 9780415351065}}</ref>\n\nDuring 1931, the New Party became increasingly influenced by [[Fascism]].<ref name=\"Britaininthe1930s\"/> The next year, after a January 1932 visit to [[Benito Mussolini]] in [[Italy]], Mosley's own conversion to fascism was confirmed. He wound up the New Party in April, but preserved its youth movement, which would form the core of the BUF, intact. He spent the summer that year writing a fascist programme, ''The Greater Britain'', and this formed the basis of policy of the BUF, which was launched on 1 October 1932.<ref name=\"Britaininthe1930s\">Thorpe, Andrew.

This anti-semitic emphasis and these high-profile resignations resulted in a significant decline in membership, dropping to below 8,000 by the end of 1935, and, ultimately, Mosley shifted the party's focus back to mainstream politics. There were frequent and continuous violent clashes between BUF party members and anti-fascist protesters, most famously at the [[Battle of Cable Street]] in October 1936, when organised anti-fascists prevented the BUF from marching through Cable Street. However, the party later staged other marches through the East End without incident, albeit not on Cable Street itself.\n\nBUF support for [[Edward VIII]] and the peace campaign to prevent a second [[World War II|World War]] saw membership and public support rise once more.<ref name=\"thurlow94\">Richard C.

Many felt the movement's energy reminded them of the suffragettes, while others felt the BUF's economic policies would offer them true equality \u2013 unlike its continental counterparts, the movement insisted it would not require women to return to domesticity and that the corporatist state would ensure adequate representation for housewives, while it would also guarantee equal wages for women and remove the marriage bar that restricted the employment of married women. The BUF also offered support for new mothers (due to concerns of falling birth rates), while also offering effective birth control, as Mosley believed it was not in the national interest to have a populace ignorant of modern scientific knowledge. While these policies were motivated more out of making the best use of women's skills in state interest than any kind of feminism, it was still a draw for many suffragettes.<ref>Martin Pugh, [https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2017/04/why-the-british-union-fascist-movement-appealed-to-so-many-women.html \"Why the Former Suffragettes Flocked to British Fascism\"], ''Slate'', 14 April 2017.

It changed its name to the '''British Union of Fascists and National Socialists''' in 1936 and, in 1937, to '''British Union'''. It was disbanded in 1940, after it was [[proscription|proscribed]] by the British government following the start of the [[Second World War]].\n\nThe BUF emerged in 1932 from the [[far-right politics in the United Kingdom|British far-right]], following the electoral defeat of its antecedent, the [[New Party (UK)|New Party]], in the [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931 general election]]. The BUF's foundation was initially met with popular support, and it attracted a sizeable following. The press baron [[Harold Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere|Lord Rothermere]] was a notable early supporter. As the party became increasingly radical, however, support declined. The [[Olympia, London|Olympia]] Rally of 1934, in which a number of anti-Fascist protestors were attacked by the paramilitary wing of the BUF, the [[Fascist Defence Force]], isolated the party from much of its following. The party's embrace of [[Nazi]]-style [[anti-semitism]] in 1936 led to increasingly violent anti-fascist disruptions, notably the 1936 [[Battle of Cable Street]] in [[London]]'s [[East End]]. The [[Public Order Act 1936]], which banned political uniforms and responded to increasing political violence, had a particularly strong effect on the BUF whose supporters were known as \"Blackshirts\" after the uniforms they wore.\n\nGrowing British hostility towards [[Nazi Germany]], with which the British press persistently associated the BUF, further contributed to the decline of the movement's membership. It was finally banned by the British government in 1940 after the start of the Second World War, amid suspicion that its remaining supporters might form a pro-Nazi \"[[fifth column]]\". A number of prominent BUF members were arrested and interned under [[Defence Regulation 18B]].\n\n==History==\n===Background===\n[[File:History of British Fascism.png|thumb|Flowchart showing the history of the early British fascist movement.]]\n[[Oswald Mosley]] was the youngest elected [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP before [[crossing the floor]] in 1922, joining first [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] and, shortly afterwards, the [[Independent Labour Party]]. He became a minister in [[Ramsay MacDonald]]'s [[Second MacDonald Ministry|Labour government]], advising on rising unemployment.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nIn 1930, Mosley issued his Mosley Memorandum, which fused [[protectionism]] with a proto-[[Keynesianism|Keynesian]] programme of policies designed to tackle the problem of unemployment, and he resigned from the Labour party soon after, in early 1931, when the plans were rejected. He immediately formed the [[New Party (UK)|New Party]], with policies based on his memorandum. Despite winning 16% of the vote at a by-election in [[Ashton-under-Lyne (UK Parliament constituency)|Ashton-under-Lyne]] in early 1931, however, the party failed to achieve any other electoral success.<ref>{{cite book|last= Powell|first= David|date=2004|title=British Politics,1910-35 - The Crisis of the Party System|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ch22p6goYYkC&pg=PA181&lpg=PA181&dq=BUF+50,000+members#v=onepage|location=|publisher=Routledge|isbn= 9780415351065}}</ref>\n\nDuring 1931, the New Party became increasingly influenced by [[Fascism]].<ref name=\"Britaininthe1930s\"/> The next year, after a January 1932 visit to [[Benito Mussolini]] in [[Italy]], Mosley's own conversion to fascism was confirmed. He wound up the New Party in April, but preserved its youth movement, which would form the core of the BUF, intact. He spent the summer that year writing a fascist programme, ''The Greater Britain'', and this formed the basis of policy of the BUF, which was launched on 1 October 1932.<ref name=\"Britaininthe1930s\">Thorpe, Andrew.

This anti-semitic emphasis and these high-profile resignations resulted in a significant decline in membership, dropping to below 8,000 by the end of 1935, and, ultimately, Mosley shifted the party's focus back to mainstream politics. There were frequent and continuous violent clashes between BUF party members and anti-fascist protesters, most famously at the [[Battle of Cable Street]] in October 1936, when organised anti-fascists prevented the BUF from marching through Cable Street. However, the party later staged other marches through the East End without incident, albeit not on Cable Street itself.\n\nBUF support for [[Edward VIII]] and the peace campaign to prevent a second [[World War II|World War]] saw membership and public support rise once more.<ref name=\"thurlow94\">Richard C.

Mosley later denounced Joyce as a traitor and condemned him for his extreme anti-semitism.

After the war, Mosley made several unsuccessful attempts to return to politics, such as via the [[Union Movement]].\n\n==Relationship with the Suffragettes==\nAttracted by \u2018modern\u2019 fascist policies, such as ending the widespread practice of sacking women from their jobs on marriage, many women joined the Blackshirts \u2014 particularly in depressed Lancashire. Eventually women constituted one-quarter of the BUF's membership.<ref name=\"Nigel, J 2004\"/>\n\nIn a January 2010 BBC documentary, ''Mother Was A Blackshirt'', James Maw reported that in 1914 [[Norah Elam]] was placed in a [[HM Prison Holloway|Holloway Prison]] cell with [[Emmeline Pankhurst]] for her involvement with the [[Suffragette]] movement, and, in 1940, was returned to the same prison with [[Diana Mosley]], this time for her involvement with the fascist movement. Another leading suffragette, [[Mary Richardson]], became head of the women's section of the BUF.\n\n[[Mary Sophia Allen]] OBE was a former branch leader of the West of England Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU). At the outbreak of the First World War, she joined the [[Women Police Volunteers]], becoming the WPV Commandant in 1920.

Mosley accompanied Elam to Northampton to introduce her to her electorate at a meeting in the Town Hall. At that meeting Mosley announced that \"he was glad indeed to have the opportunity of introducing the first candidate, and ... [thereby] killed for all time the suggestion that National Socialism proposed putting British women back into the home; this is simply not true.

Many felt the movement's energy reminded them of the suffragettes, while others felt the BUF's economic policies would offer them true equality \u2013 unlike its continental counterparts, the movement insisted it would not require women to return to domesticity and that the corporatist state would ensure adequate representation for housewives, while it would also guarantee equal wages for women and remove the marriage bar that restricted the employment of married women. The BUF also offered support for new mothers (due to concerns of falling birth rates), while also offering effective birth control, as Mosley believed it was not in the national interest to have a populace ignorant of modern scientific knowledge. While these policies were motivated more out of making the best use of women's skills in state interest than any kind of feminism, it was still a draw for many suffragettes.<ref>Martin Pugh, [https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2017/04/why-the-british-union-fascist-movement-appealed-to-so-many-women.html \"Why the Former Suffragettes Flocked to British Fascism\"], ''Slate'', 14 April 2017.

The four-part series was based on the books ''Rules of the Game'' and ''Beyond the Pale'', written by Mosley's son, [[Nicholas Mosley]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/series/28497 |title=Mosley |author=BFI Film & TV Database |year=2012 |publisher=[[British Film Institute]] |work=Bfi.org.uk |accessdate=8 November 2012}}</ref>\n* In the film ''[[It Happened Here]]'' (1964), the BUF appears to be the ruling party of German-occupied Britain. A Mosley speech is heard on the radio in the scene before everyone goes to the movies.\n* The first depiction of Mosley and the BUF in fiction occurred in [[Aldous Huxley]]'s novel, ''[[Point Counter Point]]'' (1932), where Mosley is depicted as Everard Webley, the murderous leader of the \"BFF\", the Brotherhood of Free Fascists, and comes to a nasty end.\n\n[[File:Blackshorts.svg|thumb|right|150px|Emblem of [[P. G. Wodehouse]]'s fictional ''Black Shorts'' movement that appeared in the television series ''[[Jeeves and Wooster]]''.]]\n* The BUF have featured in several books written by [[Harry Turtledove]].\n** In his [[alternative history]] novel ''[[In the Presence of Mine Enemies (2003 novel)|In the Presence of Mine Enemies]]'', set in 2010 in a world where the Nazis were triumphant, the BUF led by Prime Minister Charlie Lynton governs Britain. It is here that the first stirrings of the reform movement appear.\n** In the ''[[Southern Victory]]'' series, set in a reality where the [[Confederate States]] became independent and the [[Central Powers]] (including the United States) won [[Great War (series)|that reality's analogue of the First World War]], the 'Silver Shirts' (analogous with the BUF) entered into coalition with the Conservatives led by Churchill with Mosley being appointed as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]].\n** The BUF and Mosley also appear as background influences in Turtledove's [[Colonization (series)|Colonization]] trilogy which follows the [[Worldwar]] tetralogy and is set in the 1960s.\n* [[Pink Floyd]]'s album \"[[The Wall]]\" (1979) features BUF black shirts, particularly in the song \"Waiting for the Worms\" in which the protagonist of the conceptual album has a drug induced delusion that he is the leader of the resurgences of the BUF black shirts.\n* [[James Herbert]]'s novel ''[['48 (novel)|'48]]'' (1996) features a protagonist who is hunted by BUF Blackshirts in a devastated [[London]] after a [[biological weapon]] release in the Second World War. The history of the BUF and Mosley is recapitulated.\n* In [[Ken Follett]]'s novel ''[[Night Over Water]]'', several of the main characters are BUF members. In his book ''[[Winter of the World]]'', the Battle of Cable Street plays a role and some of the characters are involved in the BUF or in the anti-BUF organisations.\n* The BUF is also in [[Guy Walters]]' book ''The Leader'' (2003), where Mosley is the dictator of Britain in the 1930s.\n* The British humorous writer [[P. G. Wodehouse]] satirized the BUF in books and short stories. The BUF was satirized as \"The Black Shorts\".<ref name=\"Code of the Woosters\">{{cite book | author-last= Wodehouse | author-first= Pelham Grenville  | authorlink= P. G.

[[Diana Mitford]], the author's sister, had been romantically involved with Mosley since 1932.\n* In the 1992 Acorn Media production of [[Agatha Christie]]'s ''[[One, Two, Buckle My Shoe (novel)|One, Two, Buckle My Shoe]]'' with [[David Suchet]] and [[Philip Jackson (actor)|Philip Jackson]], one of the supporting characters (played by [[Christopher Eccleston]]) secures a paid position as a rank-and-file  member of the BUF.\n* The BUF and Oswald Mosley are also alluded to in [[Kazuo Ishiguro]]'s novel ''[[The Remains of the Day]]''.\n* The BUF and Mosley are shown in the BBC version of ''[[Upstairs, Downstairs (2010 TV series)|Upstairs, Downstairs]]''  (2010) where two of the characters are BUF supporters.\n* The [[Pogues]]' song \"[[Serglige Con Culainn|The Sick Bed of Cuchulainn]]\", from their album ''[[Rum Sodomy & the Lash]]'' (1985), refers to the BUF in its second verse with the line \"And you decked some fucking blackshirt who was cursing all the Yids\".\n* [[Ned Beauman]]'s first novel, ''[[Boxer, Beetle]]'' (2010), portrays the Battle of Cable Street.\n* C.J. Samson's novel, ''Dominion'' (2012), has Sir Oswald Mosley as Home Secretary in a \"post-Dunkirk peace with Germany alternate history thriller\" set in 1952. Lord Beaverbrook is Prime Minister of an authoritarian coalition government. Blackshirts tend to be auxiliary policemen.\n* In the film, ''[[The King's Speech]]'', a brief shot shows a brick wall in London plastered with posters, some reading \"Fascism is Practical Patriotism\" and others, \"Stand by the King\". Both sets of posters were put up by British Blackshirts, who supported [[King Edward VIII]]. Some historians believe Edward had fascist leanings.<ref>Ziegler, ''King Edward VIII: The official biography'', p. 392</ref>\n* In the war strategy video game ''[[Hearts of Iron IV]]'' (2016), certain options can be used to increase fascist leaning in the United Kingdom. Doing so can eventually lead to the British Union of Fascists becoming the ruling party, with Oswald Mosley as the nation's leader.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hoi4wiki.com/United_Kingdom#Political_Parties|title=United Kingdom - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki|website=www.hoi4wiki.com|accessdate=22 December 2016}}</ref> The country's name will change to the British Empire and its flag will be replaced with a cross between the Union Flag and the Flash and Circle.

The former Pakistan and Asian No. 1, Rahim was the youngest [[tennis]] player ever to play for [[Pakistan]] in the [[Davis Cup]] at 15 years of age. He was also the highest ranking Pakistani tennis player ever (a career-high singles ranking of World No. 34 in October 1977). He led the [[UCLA]] team to victory with [[Jeff Borowiak]] and [[Jimmy Connors]] in 1970\u201371 and was 1971 NCAA doubles champion with Jeff Borowiak.<ref>{{cite web| title=Haroon Rahim|url= http://sports-columns.blogspot.com/2011/01/haroon-rahim-tennis.html |accessdate=1 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nHe was from the [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]] city of [[Lahore]], from a large family of avid tennis players. His father, Mir Abdur Rahim, was a civil servant who encouraged his children, sons and daughters, to play tennis. His father loved tennis so much that he said he wanted to die on the tennis court. In 1968, he died of a heart attack while playing doubles with friends at the picturesque Mayo Gardens, Lahore.\n\nHaroon Rahim was only the second Pakistani after [[Khawaja Saeed Hai]] to make it to the Wimbledon's main draw. He played in many Grand Slams, in both singles and doubles. Rahim won two ATP titles, the first at Little Rock against former Wimbledon runner up, [[Alex Metreveli]] of the [[Soviet Union]], and then the second at Cleveland, against the former record holder of the fastest serve, Australian, [[Colin Dibley]], both in 1976.\n\nHe also lost a final to Spanish US Open winner and French Open finalist, [[Manuel Orantes]].\n\nHe also won 3 doubles titles, one at Oslo in 1974, North Conway in 1975 and Little Rock in 1978. Success was also seen in the men's doubles where he made it to the quarter finals of the US Open, the third round of Wimbledon, and the second round of the French Open.<ref>{{cite web| title=Haroon Rahim|url=http://www.daviscup.com/en/players/player/profile.aspx?playerid=10002757 |accessdate=1 December 2012}}</ref>\n \nHaroon Rahim is the winner of the closest match ever played, he beat Tom Gorman 6\u20137<sup>(3\u20135)</sup>, 7\u20136<sup>(5\u20131)</sup>, 7\u20136<sup>(5\u20134)</sup> Pennsylvania Grass Championships, as both players never losing their serve, each set went to a tie break with Haroon winning the match by just one point.\n\nLast known to be in the US, Haroon retired from tennis, severed contact with his family and his whereabouts are unknown.<ref>{{cite web| title=Crazy Diamonds|url=http://dawn.com/2012/11/01/crazy-diamonds |accessdate=1 December 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Grand Slams performance timelines==\n\n===Singles===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#efefef\"\n!

He led the [[UCLA]] team to victory with [[Jeff Borowiak]] and [[Jimmy Connors]] in 1970\u201371 and was 1971 NCAA doubles champion with Jeff Borowiak.<ref>{{cite web| title=Haroon Rahim|url= http://sports-columns.blogspot.com/2011/01/haroon-rahim-tennis.html |accessdate=1 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nHe was from the [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]] city of [[Lahore]], from a large family of avid tennis players. His father, Mir Abdur Rahim, was a civil servant who encouraged his children, sons and daughters, to play tennis. His father loved tennis so much that he said he wanted to die on the tennis court. In 1968, he died of a heart attack while playing doubles with friends at the picturesque Mayo Gardens, Lahore.\n\nHaroon Rahim was only the second Pakistani after [[Khawaja Saeed Hai]] to make it to the Wimbledon's main draw. He played in many Grand Slams, in both singles and doubles.
