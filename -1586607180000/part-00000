Reformism arose as an alternative to revolution, with leading social democrat [[Eduard Bernstein]] proposing the concept of evolutionary socialism. Revolutionary socialists, encompassing multiple social and political movements that may define revolution differently from one another, quickly targeted the nascent ideology of reformism and [[Rosa Luxemburg]] condemned Bernstein's ''[[Eduard Bernstein#Opinions|Evolutionary Socialism]]'' in her 1900 essay titled ''[[Social Reform or Revolution?]]'' The Social Democratic Party of Germany became the largest and most powerful socialist party in Europe despite being an illegal organisation until the [[anti-socialist laws]] were officially repealed in 1890. In the [[1893 German federal election|1893 federal elections]], the party gained about 1,787,000 votes, a quarter of the total votes cast according to Engels.

In spite of this attempt by Engels to merge gradualism and revolution, his effort only diluted the distinction of gradualism and revolution and had the effect of strengthening the position of the [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionists]].{{sfn|Steger|1999|pp=181\u2013196}} Engels' statements in the French newspaper ''Le Figaro'' in which he argued that \"revolution\" and the \"so-called socialist society\" were not fixed concepts, but rather constantly changing social phenomena and said that this made \"us [socialists] all evolutionists\", increased the public perception that Engels was gravitating towards evolutionary socialism. Engels also wrote that it would be \"suicidal\" to talk about a revolutionary seizure of power at a time when the historical circumstances favoured a parliamentary road to power which he predicted could happen \"as early as 1898\".{{sfnm|1a1=Steger|1y=1997|1pp=247\u2013259|2a1=Steger|2y=1999|2pp=181\u2013196}}\n\nEngels' stance of openly accepting gradualist, evolutionary and parliamentary tactics while claiming that the historical circumstances did not favour revolution caused confusion among political commentators and the public. Bernstein interpreted this as indicating that Engels was moving towards accepting parliamentary reformist and gradualist stances, but he ignored that Engels' stances were tactical as a response to the particular circumstances at that time and that Engels was still committed to revolutionary socialism. As a result, Engels was deeply distressed when he discovered that his introduction to a new edition of ''The Class Struggles in France'' had been edited by Bernstein and [[Karl Kautsky]] in a manner which left the impression that he had become a proponent of a peaceful road to socialism.{{sfn|Steger|1999|pp=181\u2013196}} On 1 April 1895, four months before his death, Engels wrote to Kautsky as follows: <blockquote>I was amazed to see today in the ''Vorw\u00e4rts'' an excerpt from my 'Introduction' that had been printed without my knowledge and tricked out in such a way as to present me as a peace-loving proponent of legality [at all costs].

In the view of democratic socialists, capitalism, based on the primacy of private property, generates inherent inequalities of wealth and power and a dominant egoism that are incompatible with the democratic values of freedom, equality, and solidarity. Only a socialist society can fully realize democratic practices. The internal conflicts within capitalism require a transition to socialism.

In the second, mainly post-war, phase, social democrats came to believe that their ideals and values could be achieved by reforming capitalism rather than abolishing it. They favored a mixed economy in which most industries would be privately owned, with only a small number of utilities and other essential services in public ownership. The idea of social democracy is now used to describe a society the economy of which is predominantly capitalist, but where the state acts to regulate the economy in the general interest, provides welfare services outside of it and attempts to alter the distribution of income and wealth in the name of social justice.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Schweickart|first=David|editor1-last=Anderson|editor1-first=Gary L.|editor2-last=Herr|editor2-first=Kathryn G.|year=2007|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Activism and Social Justice|title=Democratic Socialism|publisher=Sage Publications|volume=1|location=Thousand Oaks, California|isbn=9781412918121|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Wilson|first=Fred|date=10 July 2007|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mill/|title=John Stuart Mill|encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=17 March 2008|ref=harv}}\n{{refend}}\n\n; Journals\n{{refbegin|40em|indent=yes}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Allen|first=Christopher S.|date=1 September 2009|title='Empty Nets': Social Democracy and the 'Catch-All Party Thesis' in Germany and Sweden|journal=Party Politics|volume=15|issue=5|pages=635\u2013653|doi=10.1177/1354068809336389|issn=13540688|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Andreasson|first=Stefan|year=2006|title=he African National Congress and its Critics: 'Predatory Liberalism', Black Empowerment and Intra-Alliance Tensions in Post-Apartheid South Africa|journal=Democratization|volume=13|issue=2|pages=303\u2013322|doi=10.1080/13510340500524018|issn=13510347|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Appadorai|first=A.|year=1968|title=Recent Socialist Thought in India|journal=The Review of Politics|volume=30|issue=3|pages=349\u2013362|doi=10.1017/S0034670500041024|jstor=1406397|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Avrich|first=Paul|date=July 1968|title=Russian Anarchists and the Civil War|journal=Russian Review|volume=27|issue=3|pages=296\u2013306|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Bardhan|first1=Pranab|last2=Roemer|first2=John E.|year=1992|title=Market Socialism: A Case for Rejuvenation|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=6|issue=3|pages=101\u2013116|doi=10.1257/jep.6.3.101|issn=08953309|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Batson|first=Andrew|date=March 2017|url=http://www.cebc.org.br/sites/default/files/the_state_of_the_state_sector.pdf|title=The State of the State Sector|publisher=Gavekal Dragonomics|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Benedetto|first1=Giacomo|last2=Hix|first2=Simon|last3=Mastrorocco|first3=Nicola|url=http://personal.lse.ac.uk/hix/Working_Papers/BHM_Rise_and_Fall_of_SD.pdf|title=The Rise and Fall of Social Democracy, 1918\u20132017|date=1 July 2019|journal=Trinity Economics Papers|pages=1\u201343|accessdate=29 November 2019|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Berman|first1=Sheri|last2=Snegovaya|first2=Maria|url=https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/populism-and-the-decline-of-social-democracy/|title=Populism and the Decline of Social Democracy|journal=Journal of Democracy|volume=30|issue=3|pages=5\u201319|date=10 July 2019|doi=10.1353/jod.2019.0038|accessdate=29 November 2019|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Bilgrami|first=S.

In the face of growing economic instability in the Eurozone, as well as massive anti- austerity protests on the peripheries of Europe, the \"victims of communism\" narrative may be linked to a public relations effort to link all leftist political ideals to the horrors of Stalinism. Such a rhetorical move seems all the more potent when discursively combined with the idea that there is a moral equivalence between Jewish victims of the Holocaust and East European victims of Stalinism. This third coming of the German Historikerstreit is related to the precariousness of global capitalism, and perhaps the elite desire to discredit all political ideologies that threaten the primacy of private property and free markets.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Gimpel|first1=James G.|last2=Hoffman|first2=Adam H.|last3=Kaufmann|first3=Karen M.|date=May 2003|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e2be0e64b470a870fc28ac6462c58160d1432899|title=A Promise Fulfilled?

Remarks in New York|publisher=Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum|accessdate=10 February 2020|quote=The directive was drafted by Senator Taft at that famous breakfast in New York City a few weeks ago. Senator Taft left that meeting and told the press what the General stands for. Taft explained that the great issue in this campaign is \"creeping socialism.\" Now that is the patented trademark of the special interest lobbies. Socialism is a scare word they have hurled at every advance the people have made in the last 20 years. Socialism is what they called public power. Socialism is what they called social security. Socialism is what they called farm price supports. Socialism is what they called bank deposit insurance. Socialism is what they called the growth of free and independent labor organizations. Socialism is their name for almost anything that helps all the people. When the Republican candidate inscribes the slogan \"Down With Socialism\" on the banner of his \"great crusade,\" that is really not what he means at all. What he really means is, \"Down with Progress\u2014down with Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal,\" and \"down with Harry Truman's Fair Deal.\" That is what he means.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite

Reformism arose as an alternative to revolution, with leading social democrat [[Eduard Bernstein]] proposing the concept of evolutionary socialism. Revolutionary socialists, encompassing multiple social and political movements that may define revolution differently from one another, quickly targeted the nascent ideology of reformism and [[Rosa Luxemburg]] condemned Bernstein's ''[[Eduard Bernstein#Opinions|Evolutionary Socialism]]'' in her 1900 essay titled ''[[Social Reform or Revolution?]]'' The Social Democratic Party of Germany became the largest and most powerful socialist party in Europe despite being an illegal organisation until the [[anti-socialist laws]] were officially repealed in 1890. In the [[1893 German federal election|1893 federal elections]], the party gained about 1,787,000 votes, a quarter of the total votes cast according to Engels.

In spite of this attempt by Engels to merge gradualism and revolution, his effort only diluted the distinction of gradualism and revolution and had the effect of strengthening the position of the [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionists]].{{sfn|Steger|1999|pp=181\u2013196}} Engels' statements in the French newspaper ''Le Figaro'' in which he argued that \"revolution\" and the \"so-called socialist society\" were not fixed concepts, but rather constantly changing social phenomena and said that this made \"us [socialists] all evolutionists\", increased the public perception that Engels was gravitating towards evolutionary socialism. Engels also wrote that it would be \"suicidal\" to talk about a revolutionary seizure of power at a time when the historical circumstances favoured a parliamentary road to power which he predicted could happen \"as early as 1898\".{{sfnm|1a1=Steger|1y=1997|1pp=247\u2013259|2a1=Steger|2y=1999|2pp=181\u2013196}}\n\nEngels' stance of openly accepting gradualist, evolutionary and parliamentary tactics while claiming that the historical circumstances did not favour revolution caused confusion among political commentators and the public. Bernstein interpreted this as indicating that Engels was moving towards accepting parliamentary reformist and gradualist stances, but he ignored that Engels' stances were tactical as a response to the particular circumstances at that time and that Engels was still committed to revolutionary socialism. As a result, Engels was deeply distressed when he discovered that his introduction to a new edition of ''The Class Struggles in France'' had been edited by Bernstein and [[Karl Kautsky]] in a manner which left the impression that he had become a proponent of a peaceful road to socialism.{{sfn|Steger|1999|pp=181\u2013196}} On 1 April 1895, four months before his death, Engels wrote to Kautsky as follows: <blockquote>I was amazed to see today in the ''Vorw\u00e4rts'' an excerpt from my 'Introduction' that had been printed without my knowledge and tricked out in such a way as to present me as a peace-loving proponent of legality [at all costs].

In the view of democratic socialists, capitalism, based on the primacy of private property, generates inherent inequalities of wealth and power and a dominant egoism that are incompatible with the democratic values of freedom, equality, and solidarity. Only a socialist society can fully realize democratic practices. The internal conflicts within capitalism require a transition to socialism.

In the second, mainly post-war, phase, social democrats came to believe that their ideals and values could be achieved by reforming capitalism rather than abolishing it. They favored a mixed economy in which most industries would be privately owned, with only a small number of utilities and other essential services in public ownership. The idea of social democracy is now used to describe a society the economy of which is predominantly capitalist, but where the state acts to regulate the economy in the general interest, provides welfare services outside of it and attempts to alter the distribution of income and wealth in the name of social justice.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Schweickart|first=David|editor1-last=Anderson|editor1-first=Gary L.|editor2-last=Herr|editor2-first=Kathryn G.|year=2007|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Activism and Social Justice|title=Democratic Socialism|publisher=Sage Publications|volume=1|location=Thousand Oaks, California|isbn=9781412918121|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Wilson|first=Fred|date=10 July 2007|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mill/|title=John Stuart Mill|encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=17 March 2008|ref=harv}}\n{{refend}}\n\n; Journals\n{{refbegin|40em|indent=yes}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Allen|first=Christopher S.|date=1 September 2009|title='Empty Nets': Social Democracy and the 'Catch-All Party Thesis' in Germany and Sweden|journal=Party Politics|volume=15|issue=5|pages=635\u2013653|doi=10.1177/1354068809336389|issn=13540688|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Andreasson|first=Stefan|year=2006|title=he African National Congress and its Critics: 'Predatory Liberalism', Black Empowerment and Intra-Alliance Tensions in Post-Apartheid South Africa|journal=Democratization|volume=13|issue=2|pages=303\u2013322|doi=10.1080/13510340500524018|issn=13510347|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Appadorai|first=A.|year=1968|title=Recent Socialist Thought in India|journal=The Review of Politics|volume=30|issue=3|pages=349\u2013362|doi=10.1017/S0034670500041024|jstor=1406397|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Avrich|first=Paul|date=July 1968|title=Russian Anarchists and the Civil War|journal=Russian Review|volume=27|issue=3|pages=296\u2013306|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Bardhan|first1=Pranab|last2=Roemer|first2=John E.|year=1992|title=Market Socialism: A Case for Rejuvenation|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=6|issue=3|pages=101\u2013116|doi=10.1257/jep.6.3.101|issn=08953309|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Batson|first=Andrew|date=March 2017|url=http://www.cebc.org.br/sites/default/files/the_state_of_the_state_sector.pdf|title=The State of the State Sector|publisher=Gavekal Dragonomics|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Benedetto|first1=Giacomo|last2=Hix|first2=Simon|last3=Mastrorocco|first3=Nicola|url=http://personal.lse.ac.uk/hix/Working_Papers/BHM_Rise_and_Fall_of_SD.pdf|title=The Rise and Fall of Social Democracy, 1918\u20132017|date=1 July 2019|journal=Trinity Economics Papers|pages=1\u201343|accessdate=29 November 2019|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Berman|first1=Sheri|last2=Snegovaya|first2=Maria|url=https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/populism-and-the-decline-of-social-democracy/|title=Populism and the Decline of Social Democracy|journal=Journal of Democracy|volume=30|issue=3|pages=5\u201319|date=10 July 2019|doi=10.1353/jod.2019.0038|accessdate=29 November 2019|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Bilgrami|first=S.

In the face of growing economic instability in the Eurozone, as well as massive anti- austerity protests on the peripheries of Europe, the \"victims of communism\" narrative may be linked to a public relations effort to link all leftist political ideals to the horrors of Stalinism. Such a rhetorical move seems all the more potent when discursively combined with the idea that there is a moral equivalence between Jewish victims of the Holocaust and East European victims of Stalinism. This third coming of the German Historikerstreit is related to the precariousness of global capitalism, and perhaps the elite desire to discredit all political ideologies that threaten the primacy of private property and free markets.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Gimpel|first1=James G.|last2=Hoffman|first2=Adam H.|last3=Kaufmann|first3=Karen M.|date=May 2003|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e2be0e64b470a870fc28ac6462c58160d1432899|title=A Promise Fulfilled?

Remarks in New York|publisher=Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum|accessdate=10 February 2020|quote=The directive was drafted by Senator Taft at that famous breakfast in New York City a few weeks ago. Senator Taft left that meeting and told the press what the General stands for. Taft explained that the great issue in this campaign is \"creeping socialism.\" Now that is the patented trademark of the special interest lobbies. Socialism is a scare word they have hurled at every advance the people have made in the last 20 years. Socialism is what they called public power. Socialism is what they called social security. Socialism is what they called farm price supports. Socialism is what they called bank deposit insurance. Socialism is what they called the growth of free and independent labor organizations. Socialism is their name for almost anything that helps all the people. When the Republican candidate inscribes the slogan \"Down With Socialism\" on the banner of his \"great crusade,\" that is really not what he means at all. What he really means is, \"Down with Progress\u2014down with Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal,\" and \"down with Harry Truman's Fair Deal.\" That is what he means.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite

He himself belonged to the \u02bfAd\u012b tribe, which was part of the Rib\u0101b confederation, and therefore probably lived in [[Al-Yam\u0101ma]] and its vicinity. He had three brothers, who also composed poetry: Hish\u0101m, Mas\u02bf\u016bd, and Jirf\u0101s. He seems to have spent part of his life in the cities of Iraq, notably [[Basra]] and [[Kufa]], where it seems he spent time with such poets as [[al-Farazdaq]] (d. c. 728 CE), [[Jar\u012br ibn 'Atiya]] (d. 728\u00d729 CE), [[Ru\u02beba]] (d. 762 CE), and [[al-Kumayt]] (d. 743 CE), and the scholars [[Ab\u016b \u02bfAmr b. al-\u02bfAl\u0101\u02be]] (c. 770\u00d772 CE), [[\u02bf\u012as\u0101 b. \u02bfUmar al-Thaqaf\u012b]] (d. 766 CE), and [[\u1e24amm\u0101d al-R\u0101wiya]] (d. 772\u00d773 CE). He may have been a professional poet. He fell in love with and later married a woman called Mayya, from the Ban\u016b Minqar ([[Banu Tam\u012bm|Tam\u012bm]]), but his odes also celebrate on \u1e24arq\u0101', of the '\u0100mir b. \u1e62a'\u1e63a'a.\n\n==Work==\n\nHis extensive ''[[diwan (poetry)|diwan]]'' is widely studied. Its themes and forms included love poetry (in the ''[[nas\u012bb (poetry)|nas\u012bb]]'' and ''[[ghazal]]'' forms), self-praise (''fakhr'') about himself and his tribe, eulogy, invective, and [[Riddles (Arabic)|riddles]].<ref>Nefeli Papoutsakis, ''Desert Travel as a Form of Boasting: A Study of D\u0332\u016b r-Rumma's Poetry'', Arabische Studien, 4 (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 2009), p. 5-6, et passim.</ref><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn the assessment of Nefel Papoutsakis,\n<blockquote>Contemporary views of his poetry were generally negative: he is said to have been incompetent in satire and eulogy (al-Juma\u1e25\u012b, 551; al-Bal\u0101dhur\u012b, 10:238; al-I\u1e63fah\u0101n\u012b 18:31), an unjustified criticism, due to the prevalence of travel fakhr in his poetry. He is, nevertheless, regarded as the best poet, in Islamic times, at drawing comparisons (al-Juma\u1e25\u012b, 549; al-I\u1e63fah\u0101n\u012b, 18:9). Despite all the reported criticisms, his poetry never ceased to be studied and was often quoted in lexicographical and grammatical works, as well as in ''adab'' literature, which speaks for its high artistic quality and popularity. Many prominent figures in Arabic letters\u2014such as the poets al-\u1e62anawbar\u012b (d. c.334/945) and al-Ma\u02bfarr\u012b (d. 449/1058), who wrote commentaries on his work, and literati, including the caliph H\u0101r\u016bn al-Rash\u012bd (r. 170\u201393/786\u2013809)\u2014admired his talent. Dh\u016b l-Rumma\u2019s poetry represents a mature phase in the development of the Bedouin poetic tradition but also marks the end of its supremacy. This is succinctly expressed in Ab\u016b \u02bfAmr b. al-\u02bfAl\u0101\u02be\u2019s saying that \u201cpoetry came to an end with Dh\u016b l-Rumma\u201d (al-I\u1e63fah\u0101n\u012b, 18:9).<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>\n\n===List of poems===\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\"\n!first hemistich\n!number in Ab\u016b \u1e62\u0101li\u1e25<ref>\u02bfAbd al-Qadd\u016bs Ab\u016b \u1e62\u0101li\u1e25 ({{lang|ar|\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0642\u062f\u0648\u0633 \u0623\u0628\u0648 \u0635\u0627\u0644\u062d}}) (ed.), ''[[iarchive:diwremdiwrem|D\u012bw\u0101n Dh\u012b l-Rumma.

He himself belonged to the \u02bfAd\u012b tribe, which was part of the Rib\u0101b confederation, and therefore probably lived in [[Al-Yam\u0101ma]] and its vicinity. He had three brothers, who also composed poetry: Hish\u0101m, Mas\u02bf\u016bd, and Jirf\u0101s. He seems to have spent part of his life in the cities of Iraq, notably [[Basra]] and [[Kufa]], where it seems he spent time with such poets as [[al-Farazdaq]] (d. c. 728 CE), [[Jar\u012br ibn 'Atiya]] (d. 728\u00d729 CE), [[Ru\u02beba]] (d. 762 CE), and [[al-Kumayt]] (d. 743 CE), and the scholars [[Ab\u016b \u02bfAmr b. al-\u02bfAl\u0101\u02be]] (c. 770\u00d772 CE), [[\u02bf\u012as\u0101 b. \u02bfUmar al-Thaqaf\u012b]] (d. 766 CE), and [[\u1e24amm\u0101d al-R\u0101wiya]] (d. 772\u00d773 CE). He may have been a professional poet. He fell in love with and later married a woman called Mayya, from the Ban\u016b Minqar ([[Banu Tam\u012bm|Tam\u012bm]]), but his odes also celebrate on \u1e24arq\u0101', of the '\u0100mir b. \u1e62a'\u1e63a'a.\n\n==Work==\n\nHis extensive ''[[diwan (poetry)|diwan]]'' is widely studied. Its themes and forms included love poetry (in the ''[[nas\u012bb (poetry)|nas\u012bb]]'' and ''[[ghazal]]'' forms), self-praise (''fakhr'') about himself and his tribe, eulogy, invective, and [[Riddles (Arabic)|riddles]].<ref>Nefeli Papoutsakis, ''Desert Travel as a Form of Boasting: A Study of D\u0332\u016b r-Rumma's Poetry'', Arabische Studien, 4 (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 2009), p. 5-6, et passim.</ref><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn the assessment of Nefel Papoutsakis,\n<blockquote>Contemporary views of his poetry were generally negative: he is said to have been incompetent in satire and eulogy (al-Juma\u1e25\u012b, 551; al-Bal\u0101dhur\u012b, 10:238; al-I\u1e63fah\u0101n\u012b 18:31), an unjustified criticism, due to the prevalence of travel fakhr in his poetry. He is, nevertheless, regarded as the best poet, in Islamic times, at drawing comparisons (al-Juma\u1e25\u012b, 549; al-I\u1e63fah\u0101n\u012b, 18:9). Despite all the reported criticisms, his poetry never ceased to be studied and was often quoted in lexicographical and grammatical works, as well as in ''adab'' literature, which speaks for its high artistic quality and popularity. Many prominent figures in Arabic letters\u2014such as the poets al-\u1e62anawbar\u012b (d. c.334/945) and al-Ma\u02bfarr\u012b (d. 449/1058), who wrote commentaries on his work, and literati, including the caliph H\u0101r\u016bn al-Rash\u012bd (r. 170\u201393/786\u2013809)\u2014admired his talent. Dh\u016b l-Rumma\u2019s poetry represents a mature phase in the development of the Bedouin poetic tradition but also marks the end of its supremacy. This is succinctly expressed in Ab\u016b \u02bfAmr b. al-\u02bfAl\u0101\u02be\u2019s saying that \u201cpoetry came to an end with Dh\u016b l-Rumma\u201d (al-I\u1e63fah\u0101n\u012b, 18:9).<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>\n\n===List of poems===\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\"\n!first hemistich\n!number in Ab\u016b \u1e62\u0101li\u1e25<ref>\u02bfAbd al-Qadd\u016bs Ab\u016b \u1e62\u0101li\u1e25 ({{lang|ar|\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0642\u062f\u0648\u0633 \u0623\u0628\u0648 \u0635\u0627\u0644\u062d}}) (ed.), ''[[iarchive:diwremdiwrem|D\u012bw\u0101n Dh\u012b l-Rumma.

His military career spanned four decades and five wars, beginning with service in the [[British Indian Army]] in [[World War II]].\n\nManekshaw joined the first intake of the [[Indian Military Academy]], [[Dehradun]] in 1932. He was commissioned into the 4th Battalion, [[12th Frontier Force Regiment]]. In World War II, he was awarded the Military Cross for gallantry. Following the [[partition of India]] in 1947, he was reassigned to the [[8th Gorkha Rifles]]. Manekshaw was seconded to a planning role during the [[1947 Indo-Pakistani War]] and the [[Operation Polo|Hyderabad crisis]], and as a result, he never commanded an infantry battalion. He was promoted to the rank of brigadier while serving at the Military Operations Directorate. He became commander of 167 Infantry Brigade in 1952 and served in this position until 1954 when he took over as the Director of Military Training at Army Headquarters.\n\nAfter completing the higher command course at the [[Imperial Defence College]], he was appointed [[General Officer Commanding]] the [[26th Infantry Division (India)|26th Infantry Division]]. He also served as the [[Commandant of the Defence Services Staff College|Commandant]] of the [[Defence Services Staff College]]. In 1961, Manekshaw made derogatory comments about the political leadership which allowed his opponents to label him as unpatriotic, and he was charged with sedition. After being exonerated in the subsequent court of inquiry, he took command of [[IV Corps (India)|IV Corps]] in November 1962. The next year, Manekshaw was promoted to the position of army commander and took over [[Western Command (India)|Western Command]], transferring in 1964 to the [[Eastern Command (India)|Eastern Command]].\n\nHaving already commanded troops at [[Division (military)|division]], [[corps]] and regional levels, Manekshaw became the eighth chief of the army staff in 1969. Under his command, Indian forces conducted victorious campaigns against [[Pakistan]] in the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]], which led to the [[Bangladesh Liberation War|creation of Bangladesh]] in December 1971. He was awarded the [[Padma Vibhushan]] and the [[Padma Bhushan]], the second and third highest civilian awards of India. In January 1973, Manekshaw was conferred with the rank of [[Field Marshal]], the first army officer of independent India to be so honoured.\n\n==Early life and education==\nSam Manekshaw was born on 3 April 1914 in [[Amritsar]], [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab]], to Hormizd Manekshaw (1871\u20131964), who was a doctor, and Hilla, n\u00e9e Mehta (1885\u20131973), both [[Parsi people|Parsi]]s who moved to Amritsar from the city of [[Valsad]] in the coastal [[Gujarat]] region.{{Sfn|Panthaki|2016|p=17-18}}{{Sfn|Singh|2005|p=183}}{{Sfn|Singh|2005|p=184}}{{Sfn|Sharma|2007|p=59}} Manekshaw's parents had left Mumbai in 1903 for Lahore, where Hormizd had friends and where he was to begin practising medicine. However, by the time their train halted at Amritsar (trains used to make very long halts in those days), Hilla, who was pregnant, found it impossible to travel any further. The couple had to break journey to seek help from the station master, who advised that in her condition, Hilla should not attempt any journey until her confinement. By the time that happened, the couple had found Amritar salubrious and elected to settle in the city. Hormusji soon established a thriving clinic and pharmacy in the centre of Amritsar. The couple had six children over the following decade, numbering four sons and two daughters (Fali, Cilla, Jan, Sheru, Sam and Jami), of whom Sam was their fifth child and third son.{{Sfn|Panthaki|2016|p=18-20}}\n\nDuring the First World War, Hormusji Manekshaw served in the [[British Indian Army]] as a [[Captain (rank)|captain]] in the [[Indian Medical Service]] (IMS; now the [[Army Medical Corps (India)|Army Medical Corps]]).{{Sfn|Singh|2005|p=184}}{{Sfn|Panthaki|2016|p=18-20}} Of the Manekshaw siblings, Sam's two elder brothers Fali and Jan qualified as engineers, while Cilla and Sheru became teachers. Both Sam and his younger brother Jami served in the Indian Armed Forces, with Jami becoming a doctor like his father and serving in the [[Royal Indian Air Force]] as a medical officer; the first Indian to be awarded the air surgeon's wings from the [[Naval Air Station Pensacola]] in the United States, Jami joined his elder brother in becoming a [[flag officer]], retiring as an [[air vice marshal]] in the Indian Air Force.{{Sfn|Singh|2005|p=184}}{{Sfn|Panthaki|2016|p=22}}\n\nAs a boy, Manekshaw was mischievous and high-spirited. His early ambition was to study medicine and become a doctor like his father.{{Sfn|Panthaki|2016|p=18-20}} He completed his [[primary school]]ing in Punjab, and then went to [[Sherwood College]], [[Nainital]]. In 1929, he left the college at the age of 15 with his Junior Cambridge Certificate, an English language curriculum developed by the [[Cambridge International Examinations|University of Cambridge International Examinations]].{{Sfn|Panthaki|2016|p=21}} In 1931, he passed his [[Senior Cambridge]] (in the School Certificate of the [[International General Certificate of Secondary Education|Cambridge Board]]) with distinction. Manekshaw then asked his father to send him to London to study medicine, but his father refused on the grounds that he was not old enough; in addition, he was already supporting the studies of Manekshaw's two elder brothers, both of whom were reading engineering in London.{{Sfn|Panthaki|2016|p=22-23}}{{Sfn|Singh|2005|p=185}} Instead, Manekshaw entered the Hindu Sabha College (now the Hindu College, Amritsar), and in April 1932 sat his final exams held by the [[University of the Punjab]], passing with a third division in science.{{Sfn|Panthaki|2016|p=22-23}} \n\nIn the meantime, the Indian Military College Committee, which was set up in 1931 and chaired by [[Philip Chetwode, 1st Baron Chetwode|Field Marshal Sir Philip Chetwode]], recommended the establishment of a military academy in India to train Indians for officer commissions in the army. A three-year course was proposed, with an entry age of 18 to 20 years. Candidates would be selected on the basis of an examination conducted by the [[Union Public Service Commission|Public Service Commission]].{{Sfn|Singh|2005|p=185}} A formal notification for entrance examination to enrol in the [[Indian Military Academy]] (IMA) was issued in the early months of 1932, and examinations were scheduled for June or July.{{Sfn|Singh|2005|p=186}} In an act of rebellion against his father's refusal, Manekshaw applied for a place and sat the entrance exams in Delhi. On 1 October 1932, he was one of the fifteen cadets to be selected through open competition.{{efn|There were 40 vacancies, of which 15 were filled through open competition, 15 from the ranks of the army and remaining 10 from the state forces.{{Sfn|Singh|2005|p=186}}}} Manekshaw was placed sixth in the order of merit.{{Sfn|Singh|2005|p=186}}{{Sfn|Panthaki|2016|p=23}}\n\n===Indian Military Academy===\nManekshaw was selected as part of the first batch of cadets. Called \"The Pioneers\", his class also produced [[Smith Dun]] and [[Muhammad Musa Khan]], future commanders-in-chief of Burma and Pakistan, respectively.

[[Pran Nath Thapar]]. Earlier in the year, Maj. Gen. [[Brij Mohan Kaul]] had been promoted to lieutenant general and appointed the Quarter Master General (QMG) by Menon. The appointment was made against the recommendation of Thimayya, who resigned as a result. Kaul was made the Chief of General Staff (CGS), the second highest appointment at Army Headquarters after the COAS. Kaul cultivated a close relationship with Nehru and Menon and became even more powerful than the COAS. This was met with disapproval by senior army officials, including Manekshaw, who made derogatory comments about the interference of the political leadership in the administration of the army. This led him to be marked as an [[:wikt:antinational|anti-national]].{{Sfn|Singh|2005|pp=193\u2013197}}\n\nKaul sent informers to spy on Manekshaw who, as a result of the information gathered, was charged with sedition, and subjected to a court of inquiry. Meanwhile, two of his juniors, [[Harbaksh Singh]] and Moti Sagar, were promoted to lieutenant general and appointed as corps commanders. It was widely believed that Manekshaw had come close to being dismissed from the service. The court, presided over by the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief (GOC-in-C) of the [[Western Command (India)|Western Command]], Lt. Gen. Daulet Singh, known for his integrity, exonerated Manekshaw. Before a formal 'no case to answer' could be announced, the [[Sino-Indian War]] broke out; Manekshaw was not able to participate because of the court proceedings. The Indian Army suffered a debacle in the war, for which Kaul and Menon were held primarily responsible, and both were sacked. In November 1962, Nehru asked Manekshaw to take over the command of [[IV Corps (India)|IV Corps]]. Manekshaw told Nehru that the court action against him was a conspiracy, and that his promotion had been due for almost eighteen months; Nehru apologised.{{Sfn|Singh|2005|pp=193\u2013197}}{{Sfn|Singh|2002|p=10}} Shortly after, on 2 December 1962, Manekshaw was promoted to acting lieutenant general and appointed GOC of IV Corps at [[Tezpur]].<ref name=\"actg_lt_gen\">{{cite news |title=Part I-Section 4: Ministry of Defence (Army Branch) |page=2  |date=5 January 1963 |website= |publisher=The Gazette of India}}</ref>\n\nSoon after taking charge, Manekshaw reached the conclusion that poor leadership had been a significant factor in IV Corps' failure in the war with China. He felt that his foremost responsibility was to improve the morale of his demoralised soldiers, which he achieved by ordering them to operate more aggressively. Just five days into his command, Nehru visited the headquarters with his daughter [[Indira Gandhi]] and the COAS, and found the troops advancing. Nehru stated that he did not want any more men to die. The COAS assured him that he would get the orders to advance rescinded. Manekshaw retorted that he should be allowed to command his troops the way he wished, or he should be sent to a staff appointment. Gandhi intervened and told Manekshaw to go ahead. Though Gandhi had no official position, she had great influence in the government.

In 1970, East Pakistanis demanded autonomy for the state, but the [[Government of Pakistan|Pakistani government]] failed to satisfy these demands and, in early 1971, a demand for secession took root in East Pakistan. In March, the [[Pakistan Armed Forces]] launched a fierce campaign to curb the secessionists, the latter including soldiers and police from East Pakistan. Thousands of East Pakistanis died, and nearly ten million refugees fled to [[West Bengal]], an adjacent Indian state. In April, India decided to assist in the formation of the new nation of [[Bangladesh]].<ref name=\"Global Security - 1971 War\">{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/indo-pak_1971.htm|title=Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|work=Global Security|accessdate=27 November 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161126094736/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/indo-pak_1971.htm|archivedate=26 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nDuring a cabinet meeting towards the end of April, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi asked Manekshaw if he was prepared to go to war with Pakistan.

He also pointed out the Himalayan passes would soon open up with the forthcoming monsoon, which would result in heavy flooding.<ref name=\"EconObit\"/> After the cabinet had left the room, Manekshaw offered to resign; Gandhi declined and instead sought his advice.

About three brigades of regular Bangladeshi troops were trained, and 75,000 guerrillas were trained and equipped with arms and ammunition. These forces were used to harass the [[Pakistani Army]] stationed in East Pakistan in the lead-up to the war.{{Sfn|Singh|2005|p=206}}\n\nThe war started officially on 3 December 1971, when Pakistani aircraft bombed [[Indian Air Force]] bases in the western part of the country. The Army Headquarters, under Manekshaw's leadership, formulated the following strategy: [[II Corps (India)|II Corps]], commanded by Lt. Gen. [[Tapishwar Narain Raina]] (later [[General (India)|General]] and COAS), was to enter from the west; IV Corps, commanded by Lt. Gen. [[Sagat Singh]], was to enter from the east; [[XXXIII Corps (India)|XXXIII Corps]], commanded by Lt. Gen. Mohan L. Thapan, was to enter from the north; and the 101 Communication Zone Area, commanded by Maj. Gen. Gurbax Singh, was to provide support from the northeast. This strategy was to be executed by the Eastern Command, under Lt. Gen. [[Jagjit Singh Aurora]]. Manekshaw instructed Lt. Gen. [[J.F.R.

The last two broadcasts were delivered as replies to messages from the Pakistani commanders Maj. Gen. [[Rao Farman Ali]] and Lt. Gen. [[Amir Abdullah Khan Niazi]] to their troops, which were to have a devastating effect; they convinced the troops of the pointlessness of further resistance, and led to their defeat.{{Sfn|Singh|2005|p=208}}\n\nOn 11 December, Ali messaged the United Nations requesting a ceasefire, but it was not authorised by [[President (government title)|President]] [[Yahya Khan]], and the fighting continued. Following several discussions and consultations, and subsequent attacks by the Indian forces, Khan decided to stop the war in order to save the lives of Pakistani soldiers.{{Sfn|Singh|2005|p=208}} The actual decision to surrender was taken by Niazi on 15 December and was conveyed to Manekshaw through the United States Consul General in [[Dhaka]] via Washington. Manekshaw replied that he would stop the war only if the Pakistani troops surrendered to their Indian counterparts by 09:00 on 16 December. The deadline was extended to 15:00 the same day at Niazi's request, and the [[Pakistani Instrument of Surrender|Instrument of Surrender]] was formally signed on 16 December 1971.{{Sfn|Singh|2005|p=209}}\n\nWhen the prime minister asked Manekshaw to go to Dhaka and accept the surrender of Pakistani forces, he declined, saying that the honour should go to the GOC-in-C Eastern Command, Lt.

As a result, according to Singh, cases of looting and rape were negligible.{{Sfn|Singh|2005|p=210}} In addressing his troops on the matter, Manekshaw was quoted as saying: \"When you see a Begum (Muslim woman), keep your hands in your pockets, and think of Sam.\"{{Sfn|Singh|2005|p=210}}\n\nThe war lasted less than a fortnight and saw more than 90,000 Pakistani soldiers taken prisoner.

Singh recounts that in some cases he addressed them personally and talked to them privately, with just his [[aide-de-camp]] for company, while they shared a cup of tea. He ensured that they were well treated by the Indian Army, made provisions for them to be supplied with the copies of the Quran, and allowed them to celebrate festivals and receive letters and parcels from their loved ones.{{Sfn|Singh|2005|pp=210\u2013211}}\n\n===Promotion to field marshal===\nAfter the war, Gandhi decided to promote Manekshaw to the rank of field marshal and appoint him as the Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS). However, after several objections from  the commanders of the navy and the air force, the appointment was dropped. It was felt that, because Manekshaw was from the army, the comparatively smaller forces of the navy and air force would be neglected. Moreover, bureaucrats felt that it might challenge their influence over defence issues.{{Sfn|Singh|2005|pp=214\u2013215}} Though Manekshaw was to retire in June 1972, his term was extended by a period of six months, and \"in recognition of outstanding services to the Armed Forces and the nation,\" he was promoted to the rank of field marshal on 1 January 1973.<ref name=\"field_marshal\"/> The first Indian Army officer to be so promoted, he was formally conferred with the rank in a ceremony held at [[Rashtrapati Bhavan]] on 3 January.{{Sfn|Singh|2005|p=215}}\n\n==Honours and post-retirement==\n<!--[[File:Sam Manekshaw's statue in Pune Cantonment.jpg|thumb|150px|Manekshaw's statue in [[Pune Cantonment]]]]--><!--Freedom of Panorama required-->\nFor his service to the Indian nation, the [[President of India]] awarded Manekshaw a [[Padma Vibhushan]] in 1972.

Jacob described Manekshaw as \"anti-national; anti-government; anti-Semitic\". Jacob also said that when Manekshaw was the chief, he mentioned in a phone conversation that he had had very little confidence in Lt. Gen.

His military career spanned four decades and five wars, beginning with service in the [[British Indian Army]] in [[World War II]].\n\nManekshaw joined the first intake of the [[Indian Military Academy]], [[Dehradun]] in 1932. He was commissioned into the 4th Battalion, [[12th Frontier Force Regiment]]. In World War II, he was awarded the Military Cross for gallantry. Following the [[partition of India]] in 1947, he was reassigned to the [[8th Gorkha Rifles]]. Manekshaw was seconded to a planning role during the [[1947 Indo-Pakistani War]] and the [[Operation Polo|Hyderabad crisis]], and as a result, he never commanded an infantry battalion. He was promoted to the rank of brigadier while serving at the Military Operations Directorate. He became commander of 167 Infantry Brigade in 1952 and served in this position until 1954 when he took over as the Director of Military Training at Army Headquarters.\n\nAfter completing the higher command course at the [[Imperial Defence College]], he was appointed [[General Officer Commanding]] the [[26th Infantry Division (India)|26th Infantry Division]]. He also served as the [[Commandant of the Defence Services Staff College|Commandant]] of the [[Defence Services Staff College]]. In 1961, Manekshaw made derogatory comments about the political leadership which allowed his opponents to label him as unpatriotic, and he was charged with sedition. After being exonerated in the subsequent court of inquiry, he took command of [[IV Corps (India)|IV Corps]] in November 1962. The next year, Manekshaw was promoted to the position of army commander and took over [[Western Command (India)|Western Command]], transferring in 1964 to the [[Eastern Command (India)|Eastern Command]].\n\nHaving already commanded troops at [[Division (military)|division]], [[corps]] and regional levels, Manekshaw became the eighth chief of the army staff in 1969. Under his command, Indian forces conducted victorious campaigns against [[Pakistan]] in the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]], which led to the [[Bangladesh Liberation War|creation of Bangladesh]] in December 1971. He was awarded the [[Padma Vibhushan]] and the [[Padma Bhushan]], the second and third highest civilian awards of India. In January 1973, Manekshaw was conferred with the rank of [[Field Marshal]], the first army officer of independent India to be so honoured.\n\n==Early life and education==\nSam Manekshaw was born on 3 April 1914 in [[Amritsar]], [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab]], to Hormizd Manekshaw (1871\u20131964), who was a doctor, and Hilla, n\u00e9e Mehta (1885\u20131973), both [[Parsi people|Parsi]]s who moved to Amritsar from the city of [[Valsad]] in the coastal [[Gujarat]] region.{{Sfn|Panthaki|2016|p=17-18}}{{Sfn|Singh|2005|p=183}}{{Sfn|Singh|2005|p=184}}{{Sfn|Sharma|2007|p=59}} Manekshaw's parents had left Mumbai in 1903 for Lahore, where Hormizd had friends and where he was to begin practising medicine. However, by the time their train halted at Amritsar (trains used to make very long halts in those days), Hilla, who was pregnant, found it impossible to travel any further. The couple had to break journey to seek help from the station master, who advised that in her condition, Hilla should not attempt any journey until her confinement. By the time that happened, the couple had found Amritar salubrious and elected to settle in the city. Hormusji soon established a thriving clinic and pharmacy in the centre of Amritsar. The couple had six children over the following decade, numbering four sons and two daughters (Fali, Cilla, Jan, Sheru, Sam and Jami), of whom Sam was their fifth child and third son.{{Sfn|Panthaki|2016|p=18-20}}\n\nDuring the First World War, Hormusji Manekshaw served in the [[British Indian Army]] as a [[Captain (rank)|captain]] in the [[Indian Medical Service]] (IMS; now the [[Army Medical Corps (India)|Army Medical Corps]]).{{Sfn|Singh|2005|p=184}}{{Sfn|Panthaki|2016|p=18-20}} Of the Manekshaw siblings, Sam's two elder brothers Fali and Jan qualified as engineers, while Cilla and Sheru became teachers. Both Sam and his younger brother Jami served in the Indian Armed Forces, with Jami becoming a doctor like his father and serving in the [[Royal Indian Air Force]] as a medical officer; the first Indian to be awarded the air surgeon's wings from the [[Naval Air Station Pensacola]] in the United States, Jami joined his elder brother in becoming a [[flag officer]], retiring as an [[air vice marshal]] in the Indian Air Force.{{Sfn|Singh|2005|p=184}}{{Sfn|Panthaki|2016|p=22}}\n\nAs a boy, Manekshaw was mischievous and high-spirited. His early ambition was to study medicine and become a doctor like his father.{{Sfn|Panthaki|2016|p=18-20}} He completed his [[primary school]]ing in Punjab, and then went to [[Sherwood College]], [[Nainital]]. In 1929, he left the college at the age of 15 with his Junior Cambridge Certificate, an English language curriculum developed by the [[Cambridge International Examinations|University of Cambridge International Examinations]].{{Sfn|Panthaki|2016|p=21}} In 1931, he passed his [[Senior Cambridge]] (in the School Certificate of the [[International General Certificate of Secondary Education|Cambridge Board]]) with distinction. Manekshaw then asked his father to send him to London to study medicine, but his father refused on the grounds that he was not old enough; in addition, he was already supporting the studies of Manekshaw's two elder brothers, both of whom were reading engineering in London.{{Sfn|Panthaki|2016|p=22-23}}{{Sfn|Singh|2005|p=185}} Instead, Manekshaw entered the Hindu Sabha College (now the Hindu College, Amritsar), and in April 1932 sat his final exams held by the [[University of the Punjab]], passing with a third division in science.{{Sfn|Panthaki|2016|p=22-23}} \n\nIn the meantime, the Indian Military College Committee, which was set up in 1931 and chaired by [[Philip Chetwode, 1st Baron Chetwode|Field Marshal Sir Philip Chetwode]], recommended the establishment of a military academy in India to train Indians for officer commissions in the army. A three-year course was proposed, with an entry age of 18 to 20 years. Candidates would be selected on the basis of an examination conducted by the [[Union Public Service Commission|Public Service Commission]].{{Sfn|Singh|2005|p=185}} A formal notification for entrance examination to enrol in the [[Indian Military Academy]] (IMA) was issued in the early months of 1932, and examinations were scheduled for June or July.{{Sfn|Singh|2005|p=186}} In an act of rebellion against his father's refusal, Manekshaw applied for a place and sat the entrance exams in Delhi. On 1 October 1932, he was one of the fifteen cadets to be selected through open competition.{{efn|There were 40 vacancies, of which 15 were filled through open competition, 15 from the ranks of the army and remaining 10 from the state forces.{{Sfn|Singh|2005|p=186}}}} Manekshaw was placed sixth in the order of merit.{{Sfn|Singh|2005|p=186}}{{Sfn|Panthaki|2016|p=23}}\n\n===Indian Military Academy===\nManekshaw was selected as part of the first batch of cadets. Called \"The Pioneers\", his class also produced [[Smith Dun]] and [[Muhammad Musa Khan]], future commanders-in-chief of Burma and Pakistan, respectively. Although the academy was inaugurated by Chetwode on 10 December 1932, the cadets' military training commenced on 1 October 1932.{{Sfn|Singh|2005|p=186}} Manekshaw proved to be witty during his stay at IMA and went on to achieve a number of firsts: the first graduate to join one of the [[Gorkha regiments (India)|Gorkha regiments]]; first to serve as the Chief of the Army Staff of India; and first to attain the rank of field marshal.{{Sfn|Singh|2005|p=186}} Of the 40 cadets inducted, only 22 completed the course, and they were commissioned as [[second lieutenant]]s on 1 February 1935 with an [[:wikt:antedate|ant\u00e9-date]] seniority from 4 February 1934.{{Sfn|Singh|2005|pp=188\u2013189}}\n\n==Military career==\nAt the time of Manekshaw's commissioning, it was standard practice for newly commissioned Indian officers to be initially attached to a British regiment before being sent to an Indian unit. Thus, Manekshaw joined the 2nd Battalion, [[Royal Scots]], stationed at [[Lahore]]. He was later posted to the 4th Battalion, [[12th Frontier Force Regiment]], stationed in [[Burma]].{{Sfn|Singh|2002|pp=237\u2013259}}<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jun/30/india |title=Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw |author=Saighal, Vinod |date=30 June 2008 |website=The Guardian |accessdate=27 November 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923150853/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jun/30/india |archivedate=23 September 2016  }}</ref><ref name=\"Saluting Sam Bahadur\">{{cite web| url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Opinion/Columnists/Tarun_Vijay/The_Right_View/Saluting_Sam_Bahadur/articleshow/msid-3179920,curpg-1.cms| title=Saluting Sam Bahadur| author=Tarun, Vijay| accessdate=8 July 2008| website=The Times of India| date=30 June 2008| url-status=live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022003919/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Opinion/Columnists/Tarun_Vijay/The_Right_View/Saluting_Sam_Bahadur/articleshow/msid-3179920,curpg-1.cms| archivedate=22 October 2012| df=dmy-all}}</ref> On 1 May 1938, he was appointed quartermaster of his company.{{Sfn|Indian Army|1938|pp=510}} Already fluent in Punjabi, Hindi, Urdu, English and his parental language of Gujarati, in October 1938 Manekshaw qualified as a Higher Standard army interpreter in [[Pashto]].{{Sfn|Panthaki|2016|p=18-20}}{{Sfn|Panthaki|2016|p=21}}{{Sfn|Indian Army|1939|pp=753}}\n\n===World War II===\nBecause of a shortage of qualified officers on the outbreak of war, in the first two years of the conflict Manekshaw was appointed to the acting or temporary ranks of captain and major before promotion to substantive captain on 4 February 1942.{{Sfn|Indian Army|1945|pp=198\u2013199}} He saw action in [[Burma Campaign|Burma]] in the 1942 campaign at the [[Battle of Sittang Bridge|Sittang River]] with the 4th Battalion, 12th Frontier Force Regiment,{{Sfn|Singh|2005|p=190}} and was recognised for bravery in battle.

Before he moved on to his new appointment on 22 October, Pakistani forces infiltrated Kashmir, capturing Domel and [[Muzaffarabad]]. The following day, the ruler of the [[Jammu and Kashmir (princely state)|princely state of Jammu and Kashmir]], Maharaja [[Hari Singh]], appealed for help from India. On 25 October, Manekshaw accompanied [[V. P. Menon]], the secretary of the States Department, to [[Srinagar]]. While Menon was with the Maharaja, Manekshaw carried out an aerial survey of the situation in Kashmir. According to Manekshaw, the Maharaja signed the [[Instrument of Accession]] on the same day, and they flew back to Delhi.

Manekshaw's posting order as the commander of 3/5 GR (FF) was cancelled, and he was posted to the MO Directorate. As a consequence of the Kashmir dispute and the [[Indian annexation of Hyderabad|annexation of Hyderabad]] (code-named \"Operation Polo\"), which was also planned by the MO Directorate, Manekshaw never commanded a battalion.

[[Pran Nath Thapar]]. Earlier in the year, Maj. Gen. [[Brij Mohan Kaul]] had been promoted to lieutenant general and appointed the Quarter Master General (QMG) by Menon. The appointment was made against the recommendation of Thimayya, who resigned as a result. Kaul was made the Chief of General Staff (CGS), the second highest appointment at Army Headquarters after the COAS. Kaul cultivated a close relationship with Nehru and Menon and became even more powerful than the COAS. This was met with disapproval by senior army officials, including Manekshaw, who made derogatory comments about the interference of the political leadership in the administration of the army. This led him to be marked as an [[:wikt:antinational|anti-national]].{{Sfn|Singh|2005|pp=193\u2013197}}\n\nKaul sent informers to spy on Manekshaw who, as a result of the information gathered, was charged with sedition, and subjected to a court of inquiry. Meanwhile, two of his juniors, [[Harbaksh Singh]] and Moti Sagar, were promoted to lieutenant general and appointed as corps commanders. It was widely believed that Manekshaw had come close to being dismissed from the service. The court, presided over by the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief (GOC-in-C) of the [[Western Command (India)|Western Command]], Lt. Gen. Daulet Singh, known for his integrity, exonerated Manekshaw. Before a formal 'no case to answer' could be announced, the [[Sino-Indian War]] broke out; Manekshaw was not able to participate because of the court proceedings. The Indian Army suffered a debacle in the war, for which Kaul and Menon were held primarily responsible, and both were sacked. In November 1962, Nehru asked Manekshaw to take over the command of [[IV Corps (India)|IV Corps]]. Manekshaw told Nehru that the court action against him was a conspiracy, and that his promotion had been due for almost eighteen months; Nehru apologised.{{Sfn|Singh|2005|pp=193\u2013197}}{{Sfn|Singh|2002|p=10}} Shortly after, on 2 December 1962, Manekshaw was promoted to acting lieutenant general and appointed GOC of IV Corps at [[Tezpur]].<ref name=\"actg_lt_gen\">{{cite news |title=Part I-Section 4: Ministry of Defence (Army Branch) |page=2  |date=5 January 1963 |website= |publisher=The Gazette of India}}</ref>\n\nSoon after taking charge, Manekshaw reached the conclusion that poor leadership had been a significant factor in IV Corps' failure in the war with China. He felt that his foremost responsibility was to improve the morale of his demoralised soldiers, which he achieved by ordering them to operate more aggressively. Just five days into his command, Nehru visited the headquarters with his daughter [[Indira Gandhi]] and the COAS, and found the troops advancing. Nehru stated that he did not want any more men to die. The COAS assured him that he would get the orders to advance rescinded. Manekshaw retorted that he should be allowed to command his troops the way he wished, or he should be sent to a staff appointment. Gandhi intervened and told Manekshaw to go ahead. Though Gandhi had no official position, she had great influence in the government.

In 1970, East Pakistanis demanded autonomy for the state, but the [[Government of Pakistan|Pakistani government]] failed to satisfy these demands and, in early 1971, a demand for secession took root in East Pakistan. In March, the [[Pakistan Armed Forces]] launched a fierce campaign to curb the secessionists, the latter including soldiers and police from East Pakistan. Thousands of East Pakistanis died, and nearly ten million refugees fled to [[West Bengal]], an adjacent Indian state. In April, India decided to assist in the formation of the new nation of [[Bangladesh]].<ref name=\"Global Security - 1971 War\">{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/indo-pak_1971.htm|title=Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|work=Global Security|accessdate=27 November 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161126094736/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/indo-pak_1971.htm|archivedate=26 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nDuring a cabinet meeting towards the end of April, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi asked Manekshaw if he was prepared to go to war with Pakistan. He replied that most of his armoured and infantry divisions were deployed elsewhere, only twelve of his tanks were combat-ready, and they would be competing for rail carriages with the grain harvest. He also pointed out the Himalayan passes would soon open up with the forthcoming monsoon, which would result in heavy flooding.<ref name=\"EconObit\"/> After the cabinet had left the room, Manekshaw offered to resign; Gandhi declined and instead sought his advice.

About three brigades of regular Bangladeshi troops were trained, and 75,000 guerrillas were trained and equipped with arms and ammunition. These forces were used to harass the [[Pakistani Army]] stationed in East Pakistan in the lead-up to the war.{{Sfn|Singh|2005|p=206}}\n\nThe war started officially on 3 December 1971, when Pakistani aircraft bombed [[Indian Air Force]] bases in the western part of the country. The Army Headquarters, under Manekshaw's leadership, formulated the following strategy: [[II Corps (India)|II Corps]], commanded by Lt. Gen. [[Tapishwar Narain Raina]] (later [[General (India)|General]] and COAS), was to enter from the west; IV Corps, commanded by Lt. Gen. [[Sagat Singh]], was to enter from the east; [[XXXIII Corps (India)|XXXIII Corps]], commanded by Lt. Gen. Mohan L. Thapan, was to enter from the north; and the 101 Communication Zone Area, commanded by Maj. Gen. Gurbax Singh, was to provide support from the northeast. This strategy was to be executed by the Eastern Command, under Lt. Gen. [[Jagjit Singh Aurora]]. Manekshaw instructed Lt. Gen. [[J.F.R.

Previous {{convert|4|in|mm|adj=on|0}} weapons had been of the breech-loading ([[British ordnance terms#BL|BL]]) type. The guns were shipped one each on the [[forecastle]] and either side abreast the after torpedo tube (or amidships before and after the tube in some ships.) All ships had three funnels, the foremost being tall and narrow, the second short and wide and the third level with the second but narrower. The foremost torpedo tube was sited between the second and third funnels, a distinctive feature of this class.\n\nThere were twelve 'standard' vessels built to a common Admiralty design, and eight builders' specials that (except for ''Garland'') had a shorter, less beamy hull; five of the latter were from [[John I.

At 11:20 pm, the 4th Flotilla encountered unknown ships off their starboard quarter. Believing them to be British, the [[flotilla leader]] {{HMS|Tipperary|1915|2}} flashed a challenge. Six opposing ships, comprising the [[battleship]]s {{SMS|Westfalen||2}}, {{SMS|Nassau||2}} and {{SMS|Rheinland||2}} and three cruisers, turned on their floodlights and opened up with their secondary armament. Most aimed for ''Tipperary'' which was soon ablaze. The destroyers began to return fire and launched a torpedo attack, which led to a collision among the Germans.<ref>Massie, pp. 642\u20133</ref>\n\nDuring this first attack, ''Fortune'' and {{HMS|Ardent|1913|2}} were separated from the rest of the flotilla.

Six opposing ships, comprising the [[battleship]]s {{SMS|Westfalen||2}}, {{SMS|Nassau||2}} and {{SMS|Rheinland||2}} and three cruisers, turned on their floodlights and opened up with their secondary armament.
