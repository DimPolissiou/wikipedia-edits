It follows a ballerina who joins an established ballet company under an acclaimed director, ultimately testing her dedication to her craft when she must choose between her career and a romance with a composer. It marked the feature film debut of Shearer, an established ballerina, and also features [[Robert Helpmann]], [[L\u00e9onide Massine]], and [[Ludmilla Tch\u00e9rina]], other renowned dancers from the ballet world. The plot is based on the [[The Red Shoes (fairy tale)|eponymous fairytale]] by [[Hans Christian Andersen]], and features a ballet within it by the same title, also adapted from the Andersen work.\n\n''The Red Shoes'' was filmmaking team Powell and Pressburger's tenth collaboration and followup to 1947's ''[[Black Narcissus]]''. It had originally been conceived by Powell and producer [[Alexander Korda]] in the 1930s, from whom the duo purchased the rights in 1946. The majority of the cast were professional dancers. Filming of ''The Red Shoes'' took place in mid-1946, primarily in France and England.\n\nUpon release, ''The Red Shoes'' received critical acclaim, especially in the United States, where it received a total of five [[21st Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, including a win for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] and [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]]. It also won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score]], and was named one of the Top 10 Films of the Year by the [[National Board of Review]]. Despite this, some dance critics gave the film unfavorable reviews as they felt its fantastical, [[impressionism|impressionistic]] centerpiece sequence depicted ballet in an unrealistic manner. The film proved a major financial success, and was the first British film in history to gross over $5 million.\n\nContemporarily, it is regarded as one of the best films of [[Powell and Pressburger]]'s partnership, and in 1999, it was voted the [[BFI Top 100 British films|9th greatest British film of all time]] by the [[British Film Institute]]. The film underwent an extensive digital restoration beginning in 2006 at the [[UCLA Film and Television Archive]] to correct significant damage to the original negatives. The restored version of the film screened at the [[2009 Cannes Film Festival]], and was subsequently issued on [[Blu-ray]] by [[The Criterion Collection]]. In 2017, a poll of 150 actors, directors, writers, producers and critics for ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' magazine saw it ranked the 5th best British film ever.\n\n==Plot==\nAt a performance by the Ballet Lermontov at [[Covent Garden Opera House]], music student Julian is in attendance to hear the ballet score ''Heart of Fire'', composed by his teacher, Professor Palmer. Separately present is Victoria 'Vicky' Page, a young, unknown dancer from an aristocratic background, with her aunt, Lady Neston. As ''Heart of Fire'' progresses, Julian recognises the music as one of his own compositions. During the performance, Professor Palmer receives an invitation to an after-ballet party at Lady Neston's residence, also asking Boris Lermontov, the company impresario, to attend. Julian leaves the performance in disillusionment at his professor's plagiarism of his music. Lermontov and Vicki meet, and he invites her to a rehearsal of the company.\n\nJulian has written to Lermontov to explain the circumstances behind ''Heart of Fire'', but then tries to retrieve the letter. Lermontov's assistant Dimitri thwarts all attempts by Julian to gain entry to Lermontov's suite, but finally Lermontov gives Julian an audience. Julian says that he wishes to retrieve his letter before Lermontov has seen it, except that Lermontov has already read the letter. Lermontov asks Julian to play one of his own works at the piano. After hearing Julian play, he hires him as a [[r\u00e9p\u00e9titeur]] for the company orchestra and assistant to the company's conductor, Livingstone Montague (known colloquially to the company as 'Livy'). Lermontov realises that Julian was the true composer of ''Heart of Fire''.\n\nJulian and Vicky arrive for work at the Ballet Lermontov on the same day. Later, Vicky dances with [[Ballet Rambert]] in a matinee performance of ''[[Swan Lake]]'' at the [[Mercury Theatre, Notting Hill Gate]], in a production with a company led by [[Marie Rambert]] (who appears in the film as herself in a wordless cameo). Watching this performance, Lermontov realises her potential and invites Vicky to go with Ballet Lermontov to Paris and [[Monte Carlo]]. He decides to create a starring role for her in a new ballet, ''The Ballet of the Red Shoes'', for which Julian is to provide the music.\n\n''The Ballet of the Red Shoes'' is a resounding success and Lermontov revitalizes the company's repertoire with Vicky in the lead roles and Julian tasked with composing new scores. In the meantime, Vicky and Julian have fallen in love, but keep their relationship secret from Lermontov. Lermontov begins to have personal feelings toward Vicky; he resents the romance between her and Julian after learning of it. The impresario fires Julian; Vicky leaves the company with him. They marry and live in London, where Julian works on composing a new opera.\n\nSome time later whilst travelling, Vicky receives a visit from Lermontov, who convinces her to return to the company to dance a revival of ''The Ballet of the Red Shoes''. On opening night, Julian appears in her dressing room; he has left the premi\u00e8re of his opera at Covent Garden to find her and take her back. Lermontov arrives; he and Julian contend for Vicky's affections, each one arguing that her true destiny is with him only. Torn between her love for Julian and her need to dance, she eventually chooses the latter.\n\nJulian, realising that he has lost her, leaves for the railway station; Lermontov consoles Vicky and tries to turn her attention to the evening's performance. Vicky is escorted to the stage wearing the red shoes and, seemingly under their influence, turns and runs from the theatre. Julian, on the platform of the railway station, runs towards her. Vicky leaps from a balcony and falls in front of an approaching train, which hits her. Whether this is suicide or murder (by the red shoes) is left ambiguous. Shortly after, a shaken Lermontov appears before the audience to announce that, \"Miss Page is unable to dance tonight\u2014nor indeed any other night\". As a mark of respect, the company performs ''The Ballet of the Red Shoes'' with a spotlight on the empty space where Vicky would have been. As Vicky bleeds to death on a stretcher, she asks Julian to remove the red shoes, just as at the end of the ballet.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Moira Shearer]] as Victoria Page\n* [[Marius Goring]] as Julian Craster\n* [[Anton Walbrook]] as Boris Lermontov\n* [[L\u00e9onide Massine]] as Grischa Ljubov\n* [[Robert Helpmann]] as Ivan Boleslawsky\n* [[Albert Bassermann]] as Sergei Ratov\n* [[Ludmilla Tch\u00e9rina]] as Irina Boronskaya\n* [[Esmond Knight]] as Livingstone 'Livy' Montague\n* [[Austin Trevor]] as Professor Palmer\n* Jean Short as Terry\n* Gordon Littman as Ike\n* [[Eric Berry (actor)|Eric Berry]] as Dimitri\n* [[Irene Browne]] as Lady Neston\n* [[Jerry Verno]] as Stage Door Keeper\n* Yvonne Andre as Vicky's Dresser\n}}\n\n==Analysis==\n===\"Art versus life\"===\nA central theme to ''The Red Shoes'' is a performer's conflict between their art and personal life.{{sfn|McLean|1988|p=43}} Commenting on this theme, Powell himself stated that the film is \"about dying for art, that art is worth dying for.\"{{sfn|McLean|1988|p=43}} Film scholar Adrienne McLean, however, notes that Victoria's final leap to her death does not adequately represent this idea.{{sfn|McLean|1988|p=43}} Rather, McLean states that Victoria \"seems pushed by those she loves who would rather possess her than support her,\" and that the film ultimately illustrates the impact of \"ruthless personalities\" can have on \"the weaker or more demure.\"{{sfn|McLean|1988|p=43}}\n\nScholar Peter Fraser, in ''[[Cinema Journal]]'', observes of this tension between art and life that the film implodes its own \"narrative and lyrical worlds...&nbsp; from the moment of recognition, when Vicky looks down at her red shoes and knows that she is then her lyrical persona, her two worlds collapse.\"{{sfn|Fraser|1987|p=52}} He further states that the interpenetration of the lyrical upon the narrative \"alters the meaning of the fiction\" itself.{{sfn|Fraser|1987|p=52}} This blurring of the lyrical and the narrative is represented at the end of the film, when Vicky jumps onto the train platform; she is wearing the red shoes which she wore while preparing in her dressing room, despite the fact that in the performance her character does not put them on until part way through the ballet. Powell and Pressburger themselves discussed this idiosyncrasy{{sfn|Powell|1986|pages=650\u2013651}} and it has been subject to significant critical analysis since.<ref name=ebert>{{cite news |title=The Red Shoes (1948) |date=1 January 2005 |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20050101%2FREVIEWS08%2F501010301%2F1023 |last=Ebert |first=Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|location=Chicago|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181221061416/https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-the-red-shoes-1948|archive-date=21 December 2018}}</ref> Powell decided that it was artistically \"right\" for Vicky to be wearing the red shoes at that point because if she is not wearing them, it takes away the ambiguity over why she died.{{sfn|Powell|1986|pages=650\u2013651}}\n\n===''The Ballet of the Red Shoes''===\n{{Quote box|align=right|width=22em|bgcolor=#ffc0cb|quote=\"We have tried to make our [ballet] sequence subjective as well as objective.

A young woman sees a pair of red shoes in a shop window, which are offered to her by the demonic Shoemaker. She puts them on and begins to dance with her boyfriend. They go to a carnival, where she seemingly forgets about the boyfriend as she dances with every man she comes across. Her boyfriend is carried away and nothing is left of him but his image on a piece of cellophane, which she tramples.\n\nShe attempts to return home to her mother, but the red shoes, controlled by the Shoemaker, keep her dancing. She falls into a netherworld, where she dances with a piece of newspaper which turns briefly into her boyfriend. She is then beset by grotesque creatures, including the Shoemaker, who converge upon her in a manner reminiscent of ''[[The Rite of Spring]]''. They abruptly disappear, leaving her alone. No matter where she flees, the shoes refuse to stop dancing.\n\nNear death from exhaustion, her clothes now rags, she finds herself in front of a church where a funeral is in progress. The priest offers to help her. She motions to him to remove the shoes, and as he does so, she dies. He carries her into the church, and the Shoemaker retrieves the shoes, to be offered to his next victim.\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:Moira Shearer 1951 press photo.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Moira Shearer, a trained ballerina, was cast in the lead role]]\nPowell and Pressburger decided early on that they had to use dancers who could act rather than actors who could dance.{{sfn|Connelly|2005|pages=36\u201340}} To create a realistic feeling of a [[ballet company]] at work, and to be able to include a fifteen-minute ballet as the high point of the film, they created their own ballet company using many dancers from [[The Royal Ballet]].{{sfn|McLean|2008|pages=33\u201334}}\n\nIn casting the lead role of Victoria Page, Powell and Pressburger sought an experienced dancer who could also act.{{sfn|Connelly|2005|p=36}} Scottish ballerina Moira Shearer was recommended by [[Robert Helpmann]], who had been cast in the film as Ivan Boleslawsky, and was also appointed the [[choreography|choreographer]] of the central ballet sequence; Helpmann had worked with Shearer prior in a production of his ballet [[''Miracle in the Gorbals'']].{{sfn|Connelly|2005|p=36}} At the time, Shearer was beginning to ascend in her career with the Sadler's Wells Dance Company, dancing under [[Ninette de Valois]].{{sfn|Street|2016|p=109}} Upon reading the screenplay, Shearer declined the offer, as she felt taking a film role would negatively impact her dancing career.{{sfn|Connelly|2005|p=36}} She also felt that the screenplay presented a ballet company that was unrealistic, \"utterly unlike any ballet company that there had ever been anywhere.\"{{sfn|Connelly|2005|p=36}} She recalled: \"''Red Shoes'' was the last thing I wanted to do. I fought for a year to get away from that film, and I couldn't shake the director off.\"{{sfn|McLean|1988|p=36}}\n\nAfter Shearer's refusal of the role, American ballerinas Nana Gollner and Edwina Seaver tested for the part, but their acting abilities proved unsatisfactory to Powell and Pressburger.{{sfn|Connelly|2005|p=36}} Non-dancers [[Hazel Court]] and [[Ann Todd]] were briefly considered before Shearer changed her mind, and decided to accept the role with de Valois's blessing.{{sfn|Connelly|2005|pages=36\u201337}} Shearer claimed that de Valois, exasperated by the ordeal, finally advised her to take the role.{{sfn|McLean|1988|p=36}} Powell alternately recounted that de Valois was \"more manipulative\" in the process, and would vacillate in regard to whether or not Shearer would have a place in the company to return to once filming was completed, accounting for Shearer's alleged protracted contemplation of whether to take the part.{{sfn|McLean|1988|p=36}}\n\nFor the role of Julian Craster, the musician with whom Victoria falls in love, Marius Goring was cast.{{sfn|Connelly|2005|p=38}} While Goring\u2014at the time in his mid-30s\u2014was slightly too old to play the role, Powell and Pressburger were impressed by his \"tact and unselfish approach to his craft.\"{{sfn|Connelly|2005|p=38}} They cast Anton Walbrook in the part of Victoria's domineering ballet director, Boris Lermontov, for similar reasons, as they felt he was a \"well-mannered and sensitive actor\" who could support Shearer through their emotional scenes together.{{sfn|Connelly|2005|p=38}}\n\nThe other principal dancers cast in the film included [[L\u00e9onide Massine]] (who also served as a choreographer for his role as the shoemaker in ''The Ballet of the Red Shoes''), portraying dancer Grischa Ljubov,{{sfn|Connelly|2005|pages=39\u201340, 69}} and [[Ludmilla Tch\u00e9rina]] as dancer Irina Boronskaya; the latter was cast by Powell, who was captivated by her unconventional beauty.{{sfn|Connelly|2005|p=40}}\n\n===Filming===\nFilming of ''The Red Shoes'' took place primarily in [[Paris]], with principal photography beginning in June 1947.{{sfn|Connelly|2005|p=5}} [[Jack Cardiff]], who had shot Powell and Pressburger's ''Black Narcissus'', served as cinematographer.{{sfn|McLean|2008|p=35}} The shooting schedule ran approximately fifteen weeks, on a budget of \u00a3300,000.{{sfn|Connelly|2005|pages=5\u20136}} Filming also occurred on location in London, [[Monte Carlo]], and the [[French Riviera|Cote d'Azur]].{{sfn|Connelly|2005|p=58}} Some sequences were filmed at [[Pinewood Studios]], including the stage and orchestra pit sequences, which were sets constructed specifically for the film.{{sfn|McLean|1988|p=37}}\n{{quote box|width=27em|align=right|bgcolor=#ffc0cb|quote=\"It is the way the film is shot and edited, the number of close-ups, a particular handling of the tools of cinematic technique, that creates the drama;

Also, according to Powell, the Rank Organisation did not understand the artistic merits of the film, and this strain in the relationship between The Archers and the Rank Organisation led to the end of the partnership between them, with The Archers moving to work for Alexander Korda.{{sfn|Powell|1986|pages=650\u2013651}} Despite a lack of advertising, the film went on to become the sixth most popular film at the British box office in 1948.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article49930940 |title=The Starry Way|newspaper=[[The Courier-Mail]] |location=Brisbane |date=8 January 1949 |accessdate=11 July 2012 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/details/Screen_Volume_32_Issue_3/page/n17|magazine=Screen|page=258|volume=32|issue=3|date=Autumn 1991|title=The popular cash and culture in the postwar British cinema industry|first=Janet|last=Thumim}}</ref>\n\nThe film premiered in the United States at [[New York City]]'s [[Bijou Theatre (Manhattan)|Bijou Theatre]] on 21 October 1948,{{sfn|Connelly|2005|p=74}} distributed by [[Eagle-Lion Films]].{{sfn|McLean|2008|p=137}} By the end of the year, it had earned $2.2 million in US rentals.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/variety173-1949-01#page/n45/mode/1up \"Top Grossers of 1948\", ''Variety'' 5 January 1949 p 46]</ref> The success of this run convinced [[Universal Studios]] that ''The Red Shoes'' was a worthwhile film and they took over the U.S. distribution in 1951.

It follows a ballerina who joins an established ballet company under an acclaimed director, ultimately testing her dedication to her craft when she must choose between her career and a romance with a composer. It marked the feature film debut of Shearer, an established ballerina, and also features [[Robert Helpmann]], [[L\u00e9onide Massine]], and [[Ludmilla Tch\u00e9rina]], other renowned dancers from the ballet world. The plot is based on the [[The Red Shoes (fairy tale)|eponymous fairytale]] by [[Hans Christian Andersen]], and features a ballet within it by the same title, also adapted from the Andersen work.\n\n''The Red Shoes'' was filmmaking team Powell and Pressburger's tenth collaboration and followup to 1947's ''[[Black Narcissus]]''. It had originally been conceived by Powell and producer [[Alexander Korda]] in the 1930s, from whom the duo purchased the rights in 1946. The majority of the cast were professional dancers. Filming of ''The Red Shoes'' took place in mid-1946, primarily in France and England.\n\nUpon release, ''The Red Shoes'' received critical acclaim, especially in the United States, where it received a total of five [[21st Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, including a win for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] and [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]]. It also won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score]], and was named one of the Top 10 Films of the Year by the [[National Board of Review]]. Despite this, some dance critics gave the film unfavorable reviews as they felt its fantastical, [[impressionism|impressionistic]] centerpiece sequence depicted ballet in an unrealistic manner. The film proved a major financial success, and was the first British film in history to gross over $5 million.\n\nContemporarily, it is regarded as one of the best films of [[Powell and Pressburger]]'s partnership, and in 1999, it was voted the [[BFI Top 100 British films|9th greatest British film of all time]] by the [[British Film Institute]]. The film underwent an extensive digital restoration beginning in 2006 at the [[UCLA Film and Television Archive]] to correct significant damage to the original negatives. The restored version of the film screened at the [[2009 Cannes Film Festival]], and was subsequently issued on [[Blu-ray]] by [[The Criterion Collection]]. In 2017, a poll of 150 actors, directors, writers, producers and critics for ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' magazine saw it ranked the 5th best British film ever.\n\n==Plot==\nAt a performance by the Ballet Lermontov at [[Covent Garden Opera House]], music student Julian is in attendance to hear the ballet score ''Heart of Fire'', composed by his teacher, Professor Palmer. Separately present is Victoria 'Vicky' Page, a young, unknown dancer from an aristocratic background, with her aunt, Lady Neston. As ''Heart of Fire'' progresses, Julian recognises the music as one of his own compositions. During the performance, Professor Palmer receives an invitation to an after-ballet party at Lady Neston's residence, also asking Boris Lermontov, the company impresario, to attend. Julian leaves the performance in disillusionment at his professor's plagiarism of his music. Lermontov and Vicki meet, and he invites her to a rehearsal of the company.\n\nJulian has written to Lermontov to explain the circumstances behind ''Heart of Fire'', but then tries to retrieve the letter. Lermontov's assistant Dimitri thwarts all attempts by Julian to gain entry to Lermontov's suite, but finally Lermontov gives Julian an audience. Julian says that he wishes to retrieve his letter before Lermontov has seen it, except that Lermontov has already read the letter. Lermontov asks Julian to play one of his own works at the piano. After hearing Julian play, he hires him as a [[r\u00e9p\u00e9titeur]] for the company orchestra and assistant to the company's conductor, Livingstone Montague (known colloquially to the company as 'Livy'). Lermontov realises that Julian was the true composer of ''Heart of Fire''.\n\nJulian and Vicky arrive for work at the Ballet Lermontov on the same day. Later, Vicky dances with [[Ballet Rambert]] in a matinee performance of ''[[Swan Lake]]'' at the [[Mercury Theatre, Notting Hill Gate]], in a production with a company led by [[Marie Rambert]] (who appears in the film as herself in a wordless cameo). Watching this performance, Lermontov realises her potential and invites Vicky to go with Ballet Lermontov to Paris and [[Monte Carlo]]. He decides to create a starring role for her in a new ballet, ''The Ballet of the Red Shoes'', for which Julian is to provide the music.\n\n''The Ballet of the Red Shoes'' is a resounding success and Lermontov revitalizes the company's repertoire with Vicky in the lead roles and Julian tasked with composing new scores. In the meantime, Vicky and Julian have fallen in love, but keep their relationship secret from Lermontov. Lermontov begins to have personal feelings toward Vicky; he resents the romance between her and Julian after learning of it. The impresario fires Julian; Vicky leaves the company with him. They marry and live in London, where Julian works on composing a new opera.\n\nSome time later whilst travelling, Vicky receives a visit from Lermontov, who convinces her to return to the company to dance a revival of ''The Ballet of the Red Shoes''. On opening night, Julian appears in her dressing room; he has left the premi\u00e8re of his opera at Covent Garden to find her and take her back. Lermontov arrives; he and Julian contend for Vicky's affections, each one arguing that her true destiny is with him only. Torn between her love for Julian and her need to dance, she eventually chooses the latter.\n\nJulian, realising that he has lost her, leaves for the railway station; Lermontov consoles Vicky and tries to turn her attention to the evening's performance. Vicky is escorted to the stage wearing the red shoes and, seemingly under their influence, turns and runs from the theatre. Julian, on the platform of the railway station, runs towards her. Vicky leaps from a balcony and falls in front of an approaching train, which hits her. Whether this is suicide or murder (by the red shoes) is left ambiguous. Shortly after, a shaken Lermontov appears before the audience to announce that, \"Miss Page is unable to dance tonight\u2014nor indeed any other night\". As a mark of respect, the company performs ''The Ballet of the Red Shoes'' with a spotlight on the empty space where Vicky would have been. As Vicky bleeds to death on a stretcher, she asks Julian to remove the red shoes, just as at the end of the ballet.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Moira Shearer]] as Victoria Page\n* [[Marius Goring]] as Julian Craster\n* [[Anton Walbrook]] as Boris Lermontov\n* [[L\u00e9onide Massine]] as Grischa Ljubov\n* [[Robert Helpmann]] as Ivan Boleslawsky\n* [[Albert Bassermann]] as Sergei Ratov\n* [[Ludmilla Tch\u00e9rina]] as Irina Boronskaya\n* [[Esmond Knight]] as Livingstone 'Livy' Montague\n* [[Austin Trevor]] as Professor Palmer\n* Jean Short as Terry\n* Gordon Littman as Ike\n* [[Eric Berry (actor)|Eric Berry]] as Dimitri\n* [[Irene Browne]] as Lady Neston\n* [[Jerry Verno]] as Stage Door Keeper\n* Yvonne Andre as Vicky's Dresser\n}}\n\n==Analysis==\n===\"Art versus life\"===\nA central theme to ''The Red Shoes'' is a performer's conflict between their art and personal life.{{sfn|McLean|1988|p=43}} Commenting on this theme, Powell himself stated that the film is \"about dying for art, that art is worth dying for.\"{{sfn|McLean|1988|p=43}} Film scholar Adrienne McLean, however, notes that Victoria's final leap to her death does not adequately represent this idea.{{sfn|McLean|1988|p=43}} Rather, McLean states that Victoria \"seems pushed by those she loves who would rather possess her than support her,\" and that the film ultimately illustrates the impact of \"ruthless personalities\" can have on \"the weaker or more demure.\"{{sfn|McLean|1988|p=43}}\n\nScholar Peter Fraser, in ''[[Cinema Journal]]'', observes of this tension between art and life that the film implodes its own \"narrative and lyrical worlds...&nbsp; from the moment of recognition, when Vicky looks down at her red shoes and knows that she is then her lyrical persona, her two worlds collapse.\"{{sfn|Fraser|1987|p=52}} He further states that the interpenetration of the lyrical upon the narrative \"alters the meaning of the fiction\" itself.{{sfn|Fraser|1987|p=52}} This blurring of the lyrical and the narrative is represented at the end of the film, when Vicky jumps onto the train platform; she is wearing the red shoes which she wore while preparing in her dressing room, despite the fact that in the performance her character does not put them on until part way through the ballet.

A young woman sees a pair of red shoes in a shop window, which are offered to her by the demonic Shoemaker. She puts them on and begins to dance with her boyfriend. They go to a carnival, where she seemingly forgets about the boyfriend as she dances with every man she comes across. Her boyfriend is carried away and nothing is left of him but his image on a piece of cellophane, which she tramples.\n\nShe attempts to return home to her mother, but the red shoes, controlled by the Shoemaker, keep her dancing. She falls into a netherworld, where she dances with a piece of newspaper which turns briefly into her boyfriend. She is then beset by grotesque creatures, including the Shoemaker, who converge upon her in a manner reminiscent of ''[[The Rite of Spring]]''. They abruptly disappear, leaving her alone. No matter where she flees, the shoes refuse to stop dancing.\n\nNear death from exhaustion, her clothes now rags, she finds herself in front of a church where a funeral is in progress. The priest offers to help her. She motions to him to remove the shoes, and as he does so, she dies. He carries her into the church, and the Shoemaker retrieves the shoes, to be offered to his next victim.\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:Moira Shearer 1951 press photo.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Moira Shearer, a trained ballerina, was cast in the lead role]]\nPowell and Pressburger decided early on that they had to use dancers who could act rather than actors who could dance.{{sfn|Connelly|2005|pages=36\u201340}} To create a realistic feeling of a [[ballet company]] at work, and to be able to include a fifteen-minute ballet as the high point of the film, they created their own ballet company using many dancers from [[The Royal Ballet]].{{sfn|McLean|2008|pages=33\u201334}}\n\nIn casting the lead role of Victoria Page, Powell and Pressburger sought an experienced dancer who could also act.{{sfn|Connelly|2005|p=36}} Scottish ballerina Moira Shearer was recommended by [[Robert Helpmann]], who had been cast in the film as Ivan Boleslawsky, and was also appointed the [[choreography|choreographer]] of the central ballet sequence; Helpmann had worked with Shearer prior in a production of his ballet [[''Miracle in the Gorbals'']].{{sfn|Connelly|2005|p=36}} At the time, Shearer was beginning to ascend in her career with the Sadler's Wells Dance Company, dancing under [[Ninette de Valois]].{{sfn|Street|2016|p=109}} Upon reading the screenplay, Shearer declined the offer, as she felt taking a film role would negatively impact her dancing career.{{sfn|Connelly|2005|p=36}} She also felt that the screenplay presented a ballet company that was unrealistic, \"utterly unlike any ballet company that there had ever been anywhere.\"{{sfn|Connelly|2005|p=36}} She recalled: \"''Red Shoes'' was the last thing I wanted to do. I fought for a year to get away from that film, and I couldn't shake the director off.\"{{sfn|McLean|1988|p=36}}\n\nAfter Shearer's refusal of the role, American ballerinas Nana Gollner and Edwina Seaver tested for the part, but their acting abilities proved unsatisfactory to Powell and Pressburger.{{sfn|Connelly|2005|p=36}} Non-dancers [[Hazel Court]] and [[Ann Todd]] were briefly considered before Shearer changed her mind, and decided to accept the role with de Valois's blessing.{{sfn|Connelly|2005|pages=36\u201337}} Shearer claimed that de Valois, exasperated by the ordeal, finally advised her to take the role.{{sfn|McLean|1988|p=36}} Powell alternately recounted that de Valois was \"more manipulative\" in the process, and would vacillate in regard to whether or not Shearer would have a place in the company to return to once filming was completed, accounting for Shearer's alleged protracted contemplation of whether to take the part.{{sfn|McLean|1988|p=36}}\n\nFor the role of Julian Craster, the musician with whom Victoria falls in love, Marius Goring was cast.{{sfn|Connelly|2005|p=38}} While Goring\u2014at the time in his mid-30s\u2014was slightly too old to play the role, Powell and Pressburger were impressed by his \"tact and unselfish approach to his craft.\"{{sfn|Connelly|2005|p=38}} They cast Anton Walbrook in the part of Victoria's domineering ballet director, Boris Lermontov, for similar reasons, as they felt he was a \"well-mannered and sensitive actor\" who could support Shearer through their emotional scenes together.{{sfn|Connelly|2005|p=38}}\n\nThe other principal dancers cast in the film included [[L\u00e9onide Massine]] (who also served as a choreographer for his role as the shoemaker in ''The Ballet of the Red Shoes''), portraying dancer Grischa Ljubov,{{sfn|Connelly|2005|pages=39\u201340, 69}} and [[Ludmilla Tch\u00e9rina]] as dancer Irina Boronskaya; the latter was cast by Powell, who was captivated by her unconventional beauty.{{sfn|Connelly|2005|p=40}}\n\n===Filming===\nFilming of ''The Red Shoes'' took place primarily in [[Paris]], with principal photography beginning in June 1947.{{sfn|Connelly|2005|p=5}} [[Jack Cardiff]], who had shot Powell and Pressburger's ''Black Narcissus'', served as cinematographer.{{sfn|McLean|2008|p=35}} The shooting schedule ran approximately fifteen weeks, on a budget of \u00a3300,000.{{sfn|Connelly|2005|pages=5\u20136}} Filming also occurred on location in London, [[Monte Carlo]], and the [[French Riviera|Cote d'Azur]].{{sfn|Connelly|2005|p=58}} Some sequences were filmed at [[Pinewood Studios]], including the stage and orchestra pit sequences, which were sets constructed specifically for the film.{{sfn|McLean|1988|p=37}}\n{{quote box|width=27em|align=right|bgcolor=#ffc0cb|quote=\"It is the way the film is shot and edited, the number of close-ups, a particular handling of the tools of cinematic technique, that creates the drama;

It was used by Pacific island cultures and became a valuable commercial product for merchants in the [[Polynesia|South Seas]] and [[South Asia]] in the 1860s. This 19th-century copra trading inspired [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s 1893 novella ''[[The Beach of Fales\u00e1]]'', based on his experiences in [[Samoa]].<ref name=\"Holmes\">{{cite book | title = Treasured Islands: Cruising the South Seas With Robert Louis Stevenson | last = Holmes | first = LD | year = 2001 | publisher = Sheridan House | isbn = 1-57409-130-1 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/treasuredislands00holm }}</ref> Nowadays, the process of coconut oil extraction is performed by crushing copra to produce coconut oil (70%); the by-product is known as copra cake or copra meal (30%).\n\nOnce the oil is extracted, the remaining coconut cake is 18\u201325% [[protein]] but contains so much [[dietary fiber]] it cannot be eaten in large quantities by humans.

Copra can be made by smoke drying, sun drying, or [[kiln]] drying. Hybrid solar drying systems can also be used to for a continuous drying process. In a hybrid solar drying system, solar energy is utilized during daylight and energy from burning biomass is used when sunlight is not sufficient or during night.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hybrid Solar Dryer for Copra|url=http://copra.co.id/copra.html|website=Copra Indonesia}}</ref> Sun drying requires little more than racks and sufficient sunlight.  Halved nuts are drained of water, and left with the meat facing the sky; they can be washed to remove [[Mold (fungus)|mold]]-creating contaminants.  After two days the meat can be removed from the shell with ease, and the drying process is complete after three to five more days (up to seven in total).  Sun drying is often combined with kiln drying, eight hours of exposure to sunlight means the time spent in a kiln can be reduced by a day and the hot air the shells are exposed to in the kiln is more easily able to remove the remaining moisture.  This process can also be reversed, partially drying the copra in the kiln and finishing the process with sunlight.  Starting with sun drying requires careful inspection to avoid contamination with mold while starting with kiln-drying can harden the meat and prevent it from drying out completely in the sun.\n\nIn India, small but whole coconuts can be dried over the course of eight months to a year, and the meat inside removed and sold as a whole ball.  Meat prepared in this fashion is sweet, soft, oily and is cream-coloured instead of being white.  Coconut meat can be dried using direct heat and smoke from a fire, using simple racks to suspend the coconut over the fire.  The smoke residue can help preserve the half-dried meat but the process overall suffers from unpredictable results and the risk of fires.<ref>Grimwood et al., 1975, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=fY5hLeJ-WW4C&pg=PA49#v=onepage&q&f=false 49\u201356].</ref>\n\nWhile there are some large [[plantation]]s with integrated operations, copra remains primarily a [[smallholder]] crop. In former years copra was collected by traders going from island to island and port to port in the [[Pacific Ocean]] but South Pacific production is now much diminished, with the exception of [[Copra plantations in New Guinea|Papua New Guinea]], the [[Solomon Islands]] and [[Vanuatu]].<ref name=Observatory/>\n\n===Economics===\nCopra production begins on coconut plantations. Coconut trees are generally spaced {{convert|9|m|ft|abbr=on}} apart, allowing a density of 100\u2013160 coconut trees per hectare. A standard tree bears around 50\u201380 nuts a year, and average earnings in Vanuatu (1999) were [[United States dollar|US$]]0.20 per kg (one kg equals 8 nuts)\u2014so a farmer could earn approximately US$120 to US$320 yearly for each planted hectare. Copra has since more than doubled in price, and was quoted at US$540 per ton in the Philippines on a [[Incoterms#CIF .E2.80.93 Cost.2C Insurance .26 Freight .28named port of destination.29|CIF]] Rotterdam basis (US$0.54 per kg) by the ''[[Financial Times]]'' on 9 November 2012.\n\nIn 2017 the value of global exports of copra was $145-146 Million. The largest exporter was [[Papua New Guinea]] with 35% of the global total, followed by [[Indonesia]] (20%), [[Solomon Islands]] (13%) and [[Vanuatu]] (12%). The largest importer of copra is the [[Philippines]], which imports $93.4 Million or 64% of the global total.<ref name=Observatory>{{Cite web |url=https://oec.world/en/profile/hs92/1203/ |title=OEC: The Observatory of Economic Complexity |first1=AJG |last1=Simoes |first2=CA |last2=Hidalgo |website=oec.world |language=en |publisher=[[The Observatory of Economic Complexity]] |access-date=2019-12-17}}</ref> A very large number of small farmers and tree owners produce copra, which is a vital part of their income.\n\n===Aflatoxin susceptibility===\nUnfortunately, copra is highly susceptible to the growth of molds and their production of [[aflatoxin]]s if not dried properly.  Aflatoxins can be highly toxic, and are among the most potent known natural [[carcinogen]]s,{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} particularly affecting the liver.  Aflatoxins in copra cake, fed to animals, can be passed on in milk or meat, leading to human illnesses.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nIn the Philippines, copra is collected as dried \"cups\" (the meat from one-half of a coconut), which are shipped in large burlap (hessian) bags. At the shipping point (typically, a dock) the copra is sampled by driving a small metal tube into the bag at several points, thus perforating the cups and collecting small amounts of copra within the tubes. Those samples are measured for aflatoxin contamination. If within standards the bag is shipped.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} This method leaves the risk that many cups are missed by the random sampling\u2014and seriously contaminated copra might be missed. Because so many small producers are involved, it is impractical to monitor all the farms and drying sites (which is where aflatoxin contamination occurs). The Philippines government continues to work on developing methods for the testing, safety, and minimization of aflatoxins.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n==Animal feed==\nCopra meal is used as [[fodder]] for horses and cattle.

Copra can be made by smoke drying, sun drying, or [[kiln]] drying. Hybrid solar drying systems can also be used to for a continuous drying process. In a hybrid solar drying system, solar energy is utilized during daylight and energy from burning biomass is used when sunlight is not sufficient or during night.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hybrid Solar Dryer for Copra|url=http://copra.co.id/copra.html|website=Copra Indonesia}}</ref> Sun drying requires little more than racks and sufficient sunlight.  Halved nuts are drained of water, and left with the meat facing the sky; they can be washed to remove [[mold]]-creating contaminants.  After two days the meat can be removed from the shell with ease, and the drying process is complete after three to five more days (up to seven in total).  Sun drying is often combined with kiln drying, eight hours of exposure to sunlight means the time spent in a kiln can be reduced by a day and the hot air the shells are exposed to in the kiln is more easily able to remove the remaining moisture.  This process can also be reversed, partially drying the copra in the kiln and finishing the process with sunlight.  Starting with sun drying requires careful inspection to avoid contamination with mold while starting with kiln-drying can harden the meat and prevent it from drying out completely in the sun.\n\nIn India, small but whole coconuts can be dried over the course of eight months to a year, and the meat inside removed and sold as a whole ball.  Meat prepared in this fashion is sweet, soft, oily and is cream-coloured instead of being white.  Coconut meat can be dried using direct heat and smoke from a fire, using simple racks to suspend the coconut over the fire.  The smoke residue can help preserve the half-dried meat but the process overall suffers from unpredictable results and the risk of fires.<ref>Grimwood et al., 1975, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=fY5hLeJ-WW4C&pg=PA49#v=onepage&q&f=false 49\u201356].</ref>\n\nWhile there are some large [[plantation]]s with integrated operations, copra remains primarily a [[smallholder]] crop. In former years copra was collected by traders going from island to island and port to port in the [[Pacific Ocean]] but South Pacific production is now much diminished, with the exception of [[Copra plantations in New Guinea|Papua New Guinea]], the [[Solomon Islands]] and [[Vanuatu]].<ref name=Observatory/>\n\n===Economics===\nCopra production begins on coconut plantations. Coconut trees are generally spaced {{convert|9|m|ft|abbr=on}} apart, allowing a density of 100\u2013160 coconut trees per hectare. A standard tree bears around 50\u201380 nuts a year, and average earnings in Vanuatu (1999) were [[United States dollar|US$]]0.20 per kg (one kg equals 8 nuts)\u2014so a farmer could earn approximately US$120 to US$320 yearly for each planted hectare. Copra has since more than doubled in price, and was quoted at US$540 per ton in the Philippines on a [[Incoterms#CIF .E2.80.93 Cost.2C Insurance .26 Freight .28named port of destination.29|CIF]] Rotterdam basis (US$0.54 per kg) by the ''[[Financial Times]]'' on 9 November 2012.\n\nIn 2017 the value of global exports of copra was $145-146 Million. The largest exporter was [[Papua New Guinea]] with 35% of the global total, followed by [[Indonesia]] (20%), [[Solomon Islands]] (13%) and [[Vanuatu]] (12%). The largest importer of copra is the [[Philippines]], which imports $93.4 Million or 64% of the global total.<ref name=Observatory>{{Cite web |url=https://oec.world/en/profile/hs92/1203/ |title=OEC: The Observatory of Economic Complexity |first1=AJG |last1=Simoes |first2=CA |last2=Hidalgo |website=oec.world |language=en |publisher=[[The Observatory of Economic Complexity]] |access-date=2019-12-17}}</ref> A very large number of small farmers and tree owners produce copra, which is a vital part of their income.\n\n===Aflatoxin susceptibility===\nUnfortunately, copra is highly susceptible to the growth of molds and their production of [[aflatoxin]]s if not dried properly.  Aflatoxins can be highly toxic, and are among the most potent known natural [[carcinogen]]s,{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} particularly affecting the liver.  Aflatoxins in copra cake, fed to animals, can be passed on in milk or meat, leading to human illnesses.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nIn the Philippines, copra is collected as dried \"cups\" (the meat from one-half of a coconut), which are shipped in large burlap (hessian) bags. At the shipping point (typically, a dock) the copra is sampled by driving a small metal tube into the bag at several points, thus perforating the cups and collecting small amounts of copra within the tubes. Those samples are measured for aflatoxin contamination. If within standards the bag is shipped.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} This method leaves the risk that many cups are missed by the random sampling\u2014and seriously contaminated copra might be missed. Because so many small producers are involved, it is impractical to monitor all the farms and drying sites (which is where aflatoxin contamination occurs). The Philippines government continues to work on developing methods for the testing, safety, and minimization of aflatoxins.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n==Animal feed==\nCopra meal is used as [[fodder]] for horses and cattle.

The hazards addressed by protective equipment include physical, electrical, heat, chemicals, [[biological hazard|biohazards]], and [[Atmospheric particulate matter|airborne particulate matter]]. Protective equipment may be worn for job-related [[occupational safety and health]] purposes, as well as for [[sports]] and other  [[recreation|recreational activities]]. \"Protective clothing\" is applied to traditional categories of clothing, and \"protective gear\" applies to items such as pads, guards, shields, or masks, and others. PPE suits can be similar in appearance to a [[cleanroom suit]].\n\nThe purpose of personal protective equipment is to reduce employee exposure to hazards when [[engineering controls]] and [[administrative controls]] are not feasible or effective to reduce these risks to acceptable levels. PPE is needed when there are hazards present. PPE has the serious limitation that it does not eliminate the hazard at the source and may result in employees being exposed to the hazard if the equipment fails.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.citation.co.uk/health-and-safety/personal-protective-equipment |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014041258/http://www.citation.co.uk/health-and-safety/personal-protective-equipment |archivedate=2012-10-14 }} Personal Protective Equipment</ref>\n\nAny item of PPE imposes a barrier between the wearer/user and the working environment. This can create additional strains on the wearer;\nimpair their ability to carry out their work and create significant levels of discomfort. Any of these can discourage wearers from using PPE correctly, therefore placing them at risk of injury, ill-health or, under extreme circumstances, death. Good ergonomic design can help to minimise these barriers and can therefore help to ensure safe and healthy working conditions through the correct use of PPE.\n\nPractices of occupational safety and health can use hazard controls and interventions to mitigate workplace hazards, which pose a threat to the safety and quality of life of workers. The [[hierarchy of hazard controls]] provides a policy framework which ranks the types of hazard controls in terms of absolute risk reduction. At the top of the hierarchy are [[Hazard elimination|elimination]] and [[Hazard substitution|substitution]], which remove the hazard entirely or replace the hazard with a safer alternative. If elimination or substitution measures cannot apply, engineering controls and administrative controls, which seek to design safer mechanisms and coach safer human behavior, are implemented. Personal protective equipment ranks last on the hierarchy of controls, as the workers are regularly exposed to the hazard, with a barrier of protection. The hierarchy of controls is important in acknowledging that, while personal protective equipment has tremendous utility, it is not the desired mechanism of control in terms of worker safety.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Die Bienenz\u00fcchter (Bruegel).jpg|thumb|left|A 1568 painting depicting beekeepers in protective clothing, by [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder]].]]\nEarly PPE such as [[body armor]], boots and gloves focused on protecting the wearer's body from [[physical injury]].

[[Chemical hazard|Chemical agents]] can come into contact with the skin through direct contact with contaminated surfaces, deposition of aerosols, immersion or splashes.<ref name=\"skin\" /> Physical agents such as extreme temperatures and ultraviolet or solar radiation can be damaging to the skin over prolonged exposure.<ref name=\"skin\" /> Mechanical trauma occurs in the form of friction, pressure, abrasions, lacerations and contusions.<ref name=\"skin\" /> Biological agents such as parasites, microorganisms, plants and animals can have varied effects when exposed to the skin.<ref name=\"skin\" />\n\nAny form of PPE that acts as a barrier between the skin and the agent of exposure can be considered skin protection. Because much work is done with the hands, [[glove]]s are an essential item in providing skin protection. Some examples of gloves commonly used as PPE include [[rubber gloves]], [[cut-resistant gloves]], [[chainsaw safety clothing|chainsaw gloves]] and heat-resistant gloves. For sports and other recreational activities, many different gloves are used for protection, generally against mechanical trauma.\n\nOther than gloves, any other article of clothing or protection worn for a purpose serve to protect the skin.

The Directive is designed to ensure that PPE meets common quality and safety standards by setting out basic safety requirements for personal protective equipment, as well as conditions for its placement on the market and free movement within the EU single market. It covers \u2018any device or appliance designed to be worn or held by an individual for protection against one or more health and safety hazards\u2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/1989/686/oj/eng|title=Council Directive 89/686/EEC of 21 December 1989 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to personal protective equipment|author=|date=30 December 1989|website=europa.eu|accessdate=6 May 2018}}</ref> The directive was adopted on 21 January 1989 and came into force on 1 July 1992. The [[European Commission]] additionally allowed for a transition period until 30 June 1995 to give companies sufficient time to adapt to the legislation. After this date, all PPE placed on the market in EU Member States was required to comply with the requirements of Directive 89/686/EEC and carry the [[CE Marking]].\n\nArticle 1 of Directive 89/686/EEC defines personal protective equipment as any device or appliance designed to be worn or held by an individual for protection against one or more health and safety hazards. PPE which falls under the scope of the Directive is divided into three categories:\n* Category I: simple design (e.g. gardening gloves, footwear, ski goggles)\n* Category II:  PPE not falling into category I or III (e.g. personal flotation devices, dry and wet suits)\n* Category III:  complex design (e.g. respiratory equipment, harnesses)\n\nDirective 89/686/EEC on personal protective equipment does not distinguish between PPE for professional use and PPE for leisure purposes.\n\nPersonal protective equipment falling within the scope of the Directive must comply with the basic health and safety requirements set out in Annex II of the Directive. To facilitate conformity with these requirements, harmonized standards are developed at the European or international level by the [[European Committee for Standardization]] (CEN, CENELEC) and the [[International Organization for Standardization]] in relation to the design and manufacture of the product. Usage of the harmonized standards is voluntary and provides presumption of conformity. However, manufacturers may choose an alternative method of complying with the requirements of the Directive.\n\nPersonal protective equipment excluded from the scope of the Directive includes:\n* PPE designed for and used by the armed forces or in the maintenance of law and order;\n* PPE for self-defence (e.g. aerosol canisters, personal deterrent weapons);\n* PPE designed and manufactured for personal use against adverse atmospheric conditions (e.g. seasonal clothing, umbrellas), damp and water (e.g. dish-washing gloves) and heat;\n* PPE  used on vessels and aircraft but not worn at all times;\n* helmets and visors intended for users of two- or three-wheeled motor vehicles.\n\nThe European Commission is currently working to revise Directive 89/686/EEC. The revision will look at the scope of the Directive, the conformity assessment procedures and technical requirements regarding market surveillance. It will also align the Directive with the New Legalislative Framework. The European Commission is likely to publish its proposal in 2013. It will then be discussed by the [[European Parliament]] and [[Council of the European Union]] under the ordinary legislative procedure before being published in the [[Official Journal of the European Union]] and becoming law.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Army trainers teach NHS medics how to put on Ebola safety suits (15650293350).jpg|NHS medics practise using PPE to treat [[Ebola]] patients.\nFile:US Navy 100608-N-9520G-005 Members of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Mobile Emergency Response Support (MERS) based in Bothell, Washington, use a ANPDR-77 radial.jpg|Members of [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|FEMA]] wear PPE to protect against radioactive hazards.\nFile:Mechanized boom decontamination deepwater horizon.jpg|Worker wearing a [[face shield]], a [[helmet]], [[Tyvek|Tyvek coveralls]], [[gloves]], and [[earplug]]s while decontaminating a [[boom (containment)|containment boom]].\nFile:Haiti earthquake helper.jpg|Rescue worker wearing a half-mask [[respirator]].\nFile:Chilean Miners.jpg|Chilean miners wearing PPE.\nFile:Polizist Pepperball Dresden.jpg|Riot officer dressed in armor to protect against impacts.\nFile:Brian Elliott.jpg|[[National Hockey League]] [[goaltender]] wearing the required PPE to play.\nFile:Trawl fishermen personal flotation devices.jpg|Trawl fishermen wearing brightly colored [[personal flotation device]]s to protect against drowning.\nFile:600003 DECPOL 1.jpg|Rescue team member wearing an air permeable personal protective equipment against CBRN threats (Polycombi\u00ae)\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Wiktionary|doffing|donning}}\n{{div col}}\n* {{annotated link|Biological hazard}}\n* {{annotated link|Blunt trauma personal protective equipment}}\n* {{annotated link|Bomb disposal}}\n* {{annotated link|CBRN defense}} (Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear, known formerly as NBC)\n* {{annotated link|Chainsaw safety clothing}}\n* {{annotated link|Chemical protective clothing}}\n* {{annotated link|Environmental suit}}\n* {{annotated link|Fall arrest}}\n* {{annotated link|Hard hat}}\n* {{annotated link|Dangerous goods|Hazmat}} (hazardous materials)\n* {{annotated link|High-visibility clothing}}\n* {{annotated link|Motorcycle personal protective equipment}}\n* {{annotated link|NBC suit}}\n* {{annotated link|Personal flotation device}}\n* {{annotated link|Arc flash#Arc flash protection equipment|Personal protective equipment for arc flash}}\n* {{annotated link|Hazardous drugs#Safe handling|Safe handling of hazardous drugs}}\n* {{annotated link|Safety harness}}\n* {{annotated link|Usage of personal protective equipment}}\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Personal protective equipment}}\n*[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/emres/ppe.html CDC - Emergency Response Resources: Personal Protective Equipment - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic]\n*[http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/sectors/mechanical/personal-protective-equipment/index_en.htm European Commission, DG Enterprise, Personal Protective Equipment]\n*[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexapi!prod!CELEXnumdoc&lg=en&numdoc=31989L0686&model=guichett Directive 89/686/EEC on Personal Protective Equipment]\n*[http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/indg174.pdf A short guide to the Personal Protective Equipment at Work Regulations 1992'] INDG174(rev1), revised 8/05 (HSE)\n\n{{Occupational safety and health}}\n{{Underwater diving|divsaf}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Personal Protective Equipment}}\n[[Category:Safety clothing| ]]\n[[Category:Headgear]]\n[[Category:Protective gear| ]]\n[[Category:Occupational safety and health]]\n[[Category:Risk management in business]]\n[[Category:Industrial hygiene]]\n[[Category:Safety engineering]]\n[[Category:Environmental social science]]\n[[Category:Working conditions]]\n[[Category:Personal protective equipment]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Equipment designed to help protect an individual from hazards}}\n{{Redirect-distinguish|Safety helmet|hard hat}}\n{{pp-semi-indef}}\n\n[[File:Hazmat DEA.jpg|thumb|[[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) agents wearing Level B [[hazmat suit]]s]]\n[[File:Safety instructions at a construction site in China.JPG|thumb|Safety equipment and supervisor instructions at a construction site]]\n{{Occupational hazards}}\n\n'''Personal protective equipment''' ('''PPE''') is protective [[clothing]], [[helmets]], [[goggles]], or other garments or equipment designed to protect the wearer's body from [[injury]] or [[infection]]. The hazards addressed by protective equipment include physical, electrical, heat, chemicals, [[biological hazard|biohazards]], and [[Atmospheric particulate matter|airborne particulate matter]]. Protective equipment may be worn for job-related [[occupational safety and health]] purposes, as well as for [[sports]] and other  [[recreation|recreational activities]]. \"Protective clothing\" is applied to traditional categories of clothing, and \"protective gear\" applies to items such as pads, guards, shields, or masks, and others. PPE suits can be similar in appearance to a [[cleanroom suit]].\n\nThe purpose of personal protective equipment is to reduce employee exposure to hazards when [[engineering controls]] and [[administrative controls]] are not feasible or effective to reduce these risks to acceptable levels. PPE is needed when there are hazards present. PPE has the serious limitation that it does not eliminate the hazard at the source and may result in employees being exposed to the hazard if the equipment fails.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.citation.co.uk/health-and-safety/personal-protective-equipment |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014041258/http://www.citation.co.uk/health-and-safety/personal-protective-equipment |archivedate=2012-10-14 }} Personal Protective Equipment</ref>\n\nAny item of PPE imposes a barrier between the wearer/user and the working environment. This can create additional strains on the wearer;\nimpair their ability to carry out their work and create significant levels of discomfort. Any of these can discourage wearers from using PPE correctly, therefore placing them at risk of injury, ill-health or, under extreme circumstances, death. Good ergonomic design can help to minimise these barriers and can therefore help to ensure safe and healthy working conditions through the correct use of PPE.\n\nPractices of occupational safety and health can use hazard controls and interventions to mitigate workplace hazards, which pose a threat to the safety and quality of life of workers. The [[hierarchy of hazard controls]] provides a policy framework which ranks the types of hazard controls in terms of absolute risk reduction. At the top of the hierarchy are [[Hazard elimination|elimination]] and [[Hazard substitution|substitution]], which remove the hazard entirely or replace the hazard with a safer alternative. If elimination or substitution measures cannot apply, engineering controls and administrative controls, which seek to design safer mechanisms and coach safer human behavior, are implemented. Personal protective equipment ranks last on the hierarchy of controls, as the workers are regularly exposed to the hazard, with a barrier of protection. The hierarchy of controls is important in acknowledging that, while personal protective equipment has tremendous utility, it is not the desired mechanism of control in terms of worker safety.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Die Bienenz\u00fcchter (Bruegel).jpg|thumb|left|A 1568 painting depicting beekeepers in protective clothing, by [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder]].]]\nEarly PPE such as [[body armor]], [[boots and gloves]] focused on protecting the wearer's body from [[physical injury]]. The \"[[plague doctor]]s\" of sixteenth-century Europe also wore protective uniforms consisting of a full-length gown, helmet, glass eye coverings, gloves and boots to prevent contagion when dealing with [[plague]] victims. These were made of thick material which was then covered in wax to make it [[water-resistant]].

A single item, for example boots, may provide multiple forms of protection: a steel toe cap and steel insoles for protection of the feet from crushing or puncture injuries, impervious rubber and lining for protection from water and chemicals, high [[Reflectance|reflectivity]] and heat resistance for protection from radiant heat, and high electrical [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|resistivity]] for protection from electric shock. The protective attributes of each piece of equipment must be compared with the hazards expected to be found in the workplace.

The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.</ref> Skin hazards, which lead to occupational skin disease, can be classified into four groups. [[Chemical hazard|Chemical agents]] can come into contact with the skin through direct contact with contaminated surfaces, deposition of aerosols, immersion or splashes.<ref name=\"skin\" /> Physical agents such as extreme temperatures and ultraviolet or solar radiation can be damaging to the skin over prolonged exposure.<ref name=\"skin\" /> Mechanical trauma occurs in the form of friction, pressure, abrasions, lacerations and contusions.<ref name=\"skin\" /> Biological agents such as parasites, microorganisms, plants and animals can have varied effects when exposed to the skin.<ref name=\"skin\" />\n\nAny form of PPE that acts as a barrier between the skin and the agent of exposure can be considered skin protection. Because much work is done with the hands, [[glove]]s are an essential item in providing skin protection. Some examples of gloves commonly used as PPE include [[rubber gloves]], [[cut-resistant gloves]], [[chainsaw safety clothing|chainsaw gloves]] and heat-resistant gloves. For sports and other recreational activities, many different gloves are used for protection, generally against mechanical trauma.\n\nOther than gloves, any other article of clothing or protection worn for a purpose serve to protect the skin. [[White coat|Lab coats]] for example, are worn to protect against potential splashes of chemicals. [[Face shield]]s serve to protect one's face from potential impact hazards, chemical splashes or possible infectious fluid.\n\nMany migrant workers need training in PPE for Heat Related Illnesses prevention (HRI).  Based on study results, the research identified some potential gaps in heat safety education. While some farm workers reported receiving limited training on pesticide safety, incoming groups of farmer workers could also receive video and in-person training on HRI prevention.  These educational programs for farm workers are most effective then they are based on health behavior theories, use adult learning principles and employ train-the-trainer approaches.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=\"I Think the Temperature was 110 Degrees!\": Work Safety Discussions Among Hispanic Farmworkers|journal = Journal of Agromedicine|volume = 24|pages = 15\u201325|last=Luque|first=John S.|doi=10.1080/1059924x.2018.1536572|pmid = 30317928|pmc = 7045709|year = 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Eye protection===\n{{Main|Eye protection}}\n[[Image:Nuxos1pl.JPG|thumb|left|A paintball player wearing appropriate eye protection against impact.]]\n\nEach day, about 2000 US workers have a job-related eye injury that requires medical attention.<ref name=\"eye\">[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/eye/ CDC - Eye Safety - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707114404/https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/eye/ |date=2017-07-07 }}.

At minimum most bee keepers wear a brimmed hat and a veil made of fine mesh netting. The next level of protection involves [[leather glove]]s with long gauntlets and some way of keeping [[bees]] from crawling up one's trouser legs. In extreme cases, specially fabricated shirts and trousers can serve as barriers to the bees' stingers.\n* [[Diving equipment]], for underwater diving, constitutes equipment such as a [[diving helmet]] or [[diving mask]], an [[scuba set|underwater breathing apparatus]], and a [[diving suit]].\n* [[Firefighter]]s wear PPE designed to provide protection against fires and various fumes and gases.

The Directive is designed to ensure that PPE meets common quality and safety standards by setting out basic safety requirements for personal protective equipment, as well as conditions for its placement on the market and free movement within the EU single market. It covers \u2018any device or appliance designed to be worn or held by an individual for protection against one or more health and safety hazards\u2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/1989/686/oj/eng|title=Council Directive 89/686/EEC of 21 December 1989 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to personal protective equipment|author=|date=30 December 1989|website=europa.eu|accessdate=6 May 2018}}</ref> The directive was adopted on 21 January 1989 and came into force on 1 July 1992. The [[European Commission]] additionally allowed for a transition period until 30 June 1995 to give companies sufficient time to adapt to the legislation. After this date, all PPE placed on the market in EU Member States was required to comply with the requirements of Directive 89/686/EEC and carry the [[CE Marking]].\n\nArticle 1 of Directive 89/686/EEC defines personal protective equipment as any device or appliance designed to be worn or held by an individual for protection against one or more health and safety hazards. PPE which falls under the scope of the Directive is divided into three categories:\n* Category I: simple design (e.g. gardening gloves, footwear, ski goggles)\n* Category II:  PPE not falling into category I or III (e.g. personal flotation devices, dry and wet suits)\n* Category III:  complex design (e.g. respiratory equipment, harnesses)\n\nDirective 89/686/EEC on personal protective equipment does not distinguish between PPE for professional use and PPE for leisure purposes.\n\nPersonal protective equipment falling within the scope of the Directive must comply with the basic health and safety requirements set out in Annex II of the Directive. To facilitate conformity with these requirements, harmonized standards are developed at the European or international level by the [[European Committee for Standardization]] (CEN, CENELEC) and the [[International Organization for Standardization]] in relation to the design and manufacture of the product. Usage of the harmonized standards is voluntary and provides presumption of conformity. However, manufacturers may choose an alternative method of complying with the requirements of the Directive.\n\nPersonal protective equipment excluded from the scope of the Directive includes:\n* PPE designed for and used by the armed forces or in the maintenance of law and order;\n* PPE for self-defence (e.g. aerosol canisters, personal deterrent weapons);\n* PPE designed and manufactured for personal use against adverse atmospheric conditions (e.g. seasonal clothing, umbrellas), damp and water (e.g. dish-washing gloves) and heat;\n* PPE  used on vessels and aircraft but not worn at all times;\n* helmets and visors intended for users of two- or three-wheeled motor vehicles.\n\nThe European Commission is currently working to revise Directive 89/686/EEC. The revision will look at the scope of the Directive, the conformity assessment procedures and technical requirements regarding market surveillance. It will also align the Directive with the New Legalislative Framework. The European Commission is likely to publish its proposal in 2013. It will then be discussed by the [[European Parliament]] and [[Council of the European Union]] under the ordinary legislative procedure before being published in the [[Official Journal of the European Union]] and becoming law.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Army trainers teach NHS medics how to put on Ebola safety suits (15650293350).jpg|NHS medics practise using PPE to treat [[Ebola]] patients.\nFile:US Navy 100608-N-9520G-005 Members of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Mobile Emergency Response Support (MERS) based in Bothell, Washington, use a ANPDR-77 radial.jpg|Members of [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|FEMA]] wear PPE to protect against radioactive hazards.\nFile:Mechanized boom decontamination deepwater horizon.jpg|Worker wearing a [[face shield]], a [[helmet]], [[Tyvek|Tyvek coveralls]], [[gloves]], and [[earplug]]s while decontaminating a [[boom (containment)|containment boom]].\nFile:Haiti earthquake helper.jpg|Rescue worker wearing a half-mask [[respirator]].\nFile:Chilean Miners.jpg|Chilean miners wearing PPE.\nFile:Polizist Pepperball Dresden.jpg|Riot officer dressed in armor to protect against impacts.\nFile:Brian Elliott.jpg|[[National Hockey League]] [[goaltender]] wearing the required PPE to play.\nFile:Trawl fishermen personal flotation devices.jpg|Trawl fishermen wearing brightly colored [[personal flotation device]]s to protect against drowning.\nFile:600003 DECPOL 1.jpg|Rescue team member wearing an air permeable personal protective equipment against CBRN threats (Polycombi\u00ae)\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Wiktionary|doffing|donning}}\n{{div col}}\n* {{annotated link|Biological hazard}}\n* {{annotated link|Blunt trauma personal protective equipment}}\n* {{annotated link|Bomb disposal}}\n* {{annotated link|CBRN defense}} (Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear, known formerly as NBC)\n* {{annotated link|Chainsaw safety clothing}}\n* {{annotated link|Chemical protective clothing}}\n* {{annotated link|Environmental suit}}\n* {{annotated link|Fall arrest}}\n* {{annotated link|Hard hat}}\n* {{annotated link|Dangerous goods|Hazmat}} (hazardous materials)\n* {{annotated link|High-visibility clothing}}\n* {{annotated link|Motorcycle personal protective equipment}}\n* {{annotated link|NBC suit}}\n* {{annotated link|Personal flotation device}}\n* {{annotated link|Arc flash#Arc flash protection equipment|Personal protective equipment for arc flash}}\n* {{annotated link|Hazardous drugs#Safe handling|Safe handling of hazardous drugs}}\n* {{annotated link|Safety harness}}\n* {{annotated link|Usage of personal protective equipment}}\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Personal protective equipment}}\n*[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/emres/ppe.html CDC - Emergency Response Resources: Personal Protective Equipment - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic]\n*[http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/sectors/mechanical/personal-protective-equipment/index_en.htm European Commission, DG Enterprise, Personal Protective Equipment]\n*[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexapi!prod!CELEXnumdoc&lg=en&numdoc=31989L0686&model=guichett Directive 89/686/EEC on Personal Protective Equipment]\n*[http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/indg174.pdf A short guide to the Personal Protective Equipment at Work Regulations 1992'] INDG174(rev1), revised 8/05 (HSE)\n\n{{Occupational safety and health}}\n{{Underwater diving|divsaf}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Personal Protective Equipment}}\n[[Category:Safety clothing| ]]\n[[Category:Headgear]]\n[[Category:Protective gear| ]]\n[[Category:Occupational safety and health]]\n[[Category:Risk management in business]]\n[[Category:Industrial hygiene]]\n[[Category:Safety engineering]]\n[[Category:Environmental social science]]\n[[Category:Working conditions]]\n[[Category:Personal protective equipment]]\n", "name_user": "Bangalamania", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_protective_equipment"}

Symptomatic and supportive care tailored to the severity of the liver disease may include intravenous fluids with dextrose, active vitamin K, B vitamins, and a restricted, but high-quality protein diet with adequate carbohydrate content.\n\n=== Animals ===\nIn dogs, aflatoxin has potential to lead to liver disease. Low levels of aflatoxin exposure require continuous consumption for several weeks to months in order for signs of liver dysfunction to appear.<ref name=bingham/> Some articles have suggested the toxic level in dog food is 100\u2013300 ppb and requires continuous exposure or consumption for a few weeks to months to develop aflatoxicosis.<ref name=bastianello/> No information is available to suggest that recovered dogs will later succumb to an aflatoxin-induced disease.\n\nTurkeys are extremely susceptible to aflatoxicosis. Recent studies have revealed that this is due to the efficient [[cytochrome P450]] mediated metabolism of aflatoxin B<sub>1</sub> in the liver of turkeys and deficient [[glutathione-S-transferase]] mediated detoxification.<ref name=rawal1/><ref name=rawal2/>\n\nSome studies on pregnant hamsters showed a significant relationship between exposure of aflatoxin B<sub>1</sub> (4&nbsp;mg/kg, single dose) and the appearance of [[teratology|developmental anomalies]] in their offspring.<ref name=goldblatt/>\n\nIn 2005, Diamond Pet Foods discovered aflatoxin in a product manufactured at their facility in [[Gaston, South Carolina]].<ref>[https://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/ORA/ORAElectronicReadingRoom/ucm061767.htm FDA Inspection Report-Diamond Gaston SC Plant 12/21/2005-1/19/2006].</ref><ref>[https://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ArchiveRecalls/2005/ucm111929.htm 2005 Recall], FDA</ref> In 23 states, Diamond voluntarily recalled 19 products formulated with corn and manufactured in the Gaston facility.

The presence of this breakdown product indicates exposure to aflatoxin B<sub>1</sub> during the past 24 hours. This technique measures only recent exposure, however. Due to the [[half-life]] of this metabolite, the level of AFB<sub>1</sub>-guanine measured may vary from day to day, based on diet, it is not ideal for assessing long-term exposure.\n\nAnother technique that has been used is a measurement of the AFB<sub>1</sub>-[[serum albumin|albumin]] adduct level in the blood serum. This approach provides a more integrated measure of exposure over several weeks or months.\n\n==List of outbreaks==\n{{expand section|date=December 2014}}\n\nInternational sources of commercial [[peanut butter]], [[cooking oils]] (e.g. [[olive oil|olive]], [[Peanut oil|peanut]] and [[sesame oil]]), and [[cosmetics]] have been identified as contaminated with aflatoxin.<ref name=bao/><ref name=\"peanut\"/><ref name=analytical/> In some instances, [[Liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry|liquid chromatography]]-[[tandem mass spectrometry]] (LC-MS/MS), and other analytical methods, revealed a range from 48% to 80% of selected product samples as containing detectable quantities of aflatoxin.

He claimed to have invented the [[inverted detective story]] (a crime fiction in which the commission of the crime is described at the beginning, usually including the identity of the perpetrator, with the story then describing the detective's attempt to solve the mystery). Freeman used some of his early experiences as a colonial [[surgeon]] in his novels.\n\nMany of the [[Dr. Thorndyke]] stories involve genuine, but often quite arcane, points of scientific knowledge, from areas such as [[tropical medicine]], [[metallurgy]] and [[toxicology]].\n\n==Early life==\nAustin Freeman was the youngest of the five children of tailor Richard Freeman and Ann Maria Dunn.  He first trained as an [[apothecary]] and then studied [[medicine]] at [[Middlesex Hospital]] Medical College, qualifying in 1887.  He specialized in ear, nose, and throat.<ref>Introduction to ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'' by E. F. Bleiler, Dover, 1973</ref>  He married Annie Elizabeth the same year, with whom he had two sons.  He was house physician for a short time<ref>Introduction to ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'' by E. F. Bleiler, Dover, 1973</ref>, then entered the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Service]] and was sent to [[Accra]] on the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] as an assistant surgeon<ref>Introduction to ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'' by E. F. Bleiler, Dover, 1973</ref>.\n\n<blockquote>At this time the Gold Coast (present-day Ghana) was a group of semi-independent kingdoms, still unacculturated, subject to incursions by the European colonial powers who were eager to annex them.  The French had been attempting to buy the favor of the native kings, and a British expedition, including Freeman, set out to investigate.  It was mostly through Freeman's intelligence and tact that the expedition was not massacred, and his future seemed assured in the colonial service.<ref>Introduction to ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'' by E. F. Bleiler, Dover, 1973</ref></blockquote>\n\nUnfortunately, he contracted [[blackwater fever]] and was sent home.<ref>Author's biography, ''A Silent Witness'', House of Stratus, 2001</ref>\n\n==Career==\nThus, he returned to [[London]] in 1891, serving for a time as acting physician in [[Holloway Prison]]<ref>Author's biography, ''A Silent Witness'', House of Stratus, 2001</ref> and an immigration examiner at the Port of London.<ref>Introduction to ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'' by E. F. Bleiler, Dover, 1973</ref>  However, he was unable to find a permanent medical position and had precarious health still from the blackwater fever (which can take years to recover from)<ref>Introduction to ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'' by E. F. Bleiler, Dover, 1973</ref>, so decided to settle down in Gravesend and earn money from writing fiction, while continuing to practice medicine.  His first successful stories were the Romney Pringle rogue stories published in ''[[Cassell's Magazine]]'' in 1902 and 1903<ref>Introduction to ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'' by E. F. Bleiler, Dover, 1973</ref> written in collaboration with [[John James Pitcairn]] (1860\u20131936), medical officer at [[Holloway Prison]], and published under the ''[[nom de plume]]'' \"Clifford Ashdown\".\n\n<blockquote>In 1905 Freeman published his first independent novel, ''The Golden Peel'', which was based on the lore he had accumulated in Africa.  Recounting the adventures of a young Englishman who steals a fetish treasure, it is a colorful, thrilling story, all the more unusual in being ethnographically accurate.  The white man's factory, the bush, the trade trails, village life, tribal wars, various ethnic groups are all described with vividness.  Today, one can fault the novel for specious morality, but it remains a remarkable book.  Before the rise of the modern African states it used to be required reading for members of the British colonial services in Africa.<ref>Introduction to ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'' by E. F. Bleiler, Dover, 1973</ref></blockquote>\n\nHis first Thorndyke story, ''The Red Thumb Mark'', was published in 1907, and shortly afterwards he pioneered the [[inverted detective story]], in which the identity of the criminal is shown from the beginning.  Some short stories with this feature were collected in ''The Singing Bone'' in 1912.  During [[World War I|the First World War]] he served as an induction physician <ref>Introduction to ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'' by E. F. Bleiler, Dover, 1973</ref> and a captain in the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] and afterwards produced a Thorndyke novel almost every year until his death in 1943. The house where he died, 94 Windmill Street in Gravesend, is now Thorndyke's Nursing Home.  Norman Donaldson wrote a full biography, ''In Search of Dr. Throndyke'', [[Bowling Green University]] Popular Press, Bowling Green, Ohio, 1971.\n\nFreeman claimed to have invented the [[inverted detective story]] in his 1912 collection of short stories ''The Singing Bone''. \"Some years ago I devised, as an experiment, an inverted detective story in two parts.  The first part was a minute and detailed description of a crime, setting forth the antecedents, motives, and all attendant circumstances.  The reader had seen the crime committed, knew all about the criminal, and was in possession of all the facts.  It would have seemed that there was nothing left to tell, but I calculated that the reader would be so occupied with the crime that he would overlook the evidence.  And so it turned out.  The second part, which described the investigation of the crime, had to most readers the effect of new matter.\"<ref>This is a quote from an essay by Freeman entitled \"The Art of the Detective Story\", which is itself quoted in ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'' (Dover, New York, 1973), in the introduction by E.

For the first twenty-five years of his career, at least, he dominated the world of British detective fiction. ... Freeman was always in the forefront of the form. Today, with [[G. K.

He claimed to have invented the [[inverted detective story]] (a crime fiction in which the commission of the crime is described at the beginning, usually including the identity of the perpetrator, with the story then describing the detective's attempt to solve the mystery). Freeman used some of his early experiences as a colonial [[surgeon]] in his novels.\n\nMany of the [[Dr. Thorndyke]] stories involve genuine, but often quite arcane, points of scientific knowledge, from areas such as [[tropical medicine]], [[metallurgy]] and [[toxicology]].\n\n==Early life==\nAustin Freeman was the youngest of the five children of tailor Richard Freeman and Ann Maria Dunn.  He first trained as an [[apothecary]] and then studied [[medicine]] at [[Middlesex Hospital]] Medical College, qualifying in 1887.  He specialized in ear, nose, and throat.<ref>Introduction to ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'' by E. F. Bleiler, Dover, 1973</ref>  He married Annie Elizabeth the same year, with whom he had two sons.  He was house physician for a short time<ref>Introduction to ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'' by E. F. Bleiler, Dover, 1973</ref>, then entered the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Service]] and was sent to [[Accra]] on the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] as an assistant surgeon<ref>Introduction to ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'' by E. F. Bleiler, Dover, 1973</ref>.\n\n<blockquote>At this time the Gold Coast (present-day Ghana) was a group of semi-independent kingdoms, still unacculturated, subject to incursions by the European colonial powers who were eager to annex them.  The French had been attempting to buy the favor of the native kings, and a British expedition, including Freeman, set out to investigate.  It was mostly through Freeman's intelligence and tact that the expedition was not massacred, and his future seemed assured in the colonial service.<ref>Introduction to ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'' by E. F. Bleiler, Dover, 1973</ref></blockquote>\n\nUnfortunately, he contracted [[blackwater fever]] and was sent home.<ref>Author's biography, ''A Silent Witness'', House of Stratus, 2001</ref>\n\n==Career==\nThus, he returned to [[London]] in 1891, serving for a time as acting physician in [[Holloway Prison]]<ref>Author's biography, ''A Silent Witness'', House of Stratus, 2001</ref> and an immigration examiner at the Port of London.<ref>Introduction to ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'' by E. F. Bleiler, Dover, 1973</ref>  However, he was unable to find a permanent medical position and had precarious health still from the blackwater fever (which can take years to recover from)<ref>Introduction to ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'' by E. F. Bleiler, Dover, 1973</ref>, so decided to settle down in Gravesend and earn money from writing fiction, while continuing to practice medicine.  His first successful stories were the Romney Pringle rogue stories published in ''[[Cassell's Magazine]]'' in 1902 and 1903<ref>Introduction to ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'' by E. F. Bleiler, Dover, 1973</ref> written in collaboration with [[John James Pitcairn]] (1860\u20131936), medical officer at [[Holloway Prison]], and published under the ''[[nom de plume]]'' \"Clifford Ashdown\".\n\n<blockquote>In 1905 Freeman published his first independent novel, ''The Golden Peel'', which was based on the lore he had accumulated in Africa.  Recounting the adventures of a young Englishman who steals a fetish treasure, it is a colorful, thrilling story, all the more unusual in being ethnographically accurate.  The white man's factory, the bush, the trade trails, village life, tribal wars, various ethnic groups are all described with vividness.  Today, one can fault the novel for specious morality, but it remains a remarkable book.  Before the rise of the modern African states it used to be required reading for members of the British colonial services in Africa.<ref>Introduction to ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'' by E. F. Bleiler, Dover, 1973</ref></blockquote>\n\nHis first Thorndyke story, ''The Red Thumb Mark'', was published in 1907, and shortly afterwards he pioneered the [[inverted detective story]], in which the identity of the criminal is shown from the beginning.  Some short stories with this feature were collected in ''The Singing Bone'' in 1912.  During [[World War I|the First World War]] he served as an induction physician <ref>Introduction to ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'' by E. F. Bleiler, Dover, 1973</ref> and a captain in the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] and afterwards produced a Thorndyke novel almost every year until his death in 1943. The house where he died, 94 Windmill Street in Gravesend, is now Thorndyke's Nursing Home.  Norman Donaldson wrote a full biography, ''In Search of Dr. Throndyke'', [[Bowling Green University]] Popular Press, Bowling Green, Ohio, 1971.\n\nFreeman claimed to have invented the [[inverted detective story]] in his 1912 collection of short stories ''The Singing Bone''. \"Some years ago I devised, as an experiment, an inverted detective story in two parts.  The first part was a minute and detailed description of a crime, setting forth the antecedents, motives, and all attendant circumstances.  The reader had seen the crime committed, knew all about the criminal, and was in possession of all the facts.  It would have seemed that there was nothing left to tell, but I calculated that the reader would be so occupied with the crime that he would overlook the evidence.  And so it turned out.  The second part, which described the investigation of the crime, had to most readers the effect of new matter.\"<ref>This is a quote from an essay by Freeman entitled \"The Art of the Detective Story\", which is itself quoted in ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'' (Dover, New York, 1973), in the introduction by E. F.

For the first twenty-five years of his career, at least, he dominated the world of British detective fiction. ... Freeman was always in the forefront of the form. Today, with [[G. K. Chesterton|Chesterton]], who is remembered for other reasons, he is one of the very few Edwardian detective story writers who are still read.\"<ref name=\"Bleiler\">R. Austin Freeman, ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'', 1973, Dover (New York), {{ISBN|0-486-20388-3}}, from the introduction by E. F. Bleiler</ref>\n\n\"[[Raymond Chandler]], whose essay '[[The Simple Art of Murder]]' did much toward demolishing the classical detective story, had this to say in a letter to [[Hamish Hamilton]], the British publisher: 'This man Austin Freeman is a wonderful performer.  He has no equal in his genre, and he is also a much better writer than you might think, if you were superficially inclined, because in spite of the immense leisure of his writing, he accomplishes an even suspense which is quite unexpected ... There is even a gaslight charm about his Victorian love affairs, and those wonderful walks across London ...'  Most of us agree with Chandler.\"<ref name=\"Bleiler\" />\n\nIn ''Bloody Murder'', [[Julian Symons]] wrote: \"... [his] talents as a writer were negligible.
