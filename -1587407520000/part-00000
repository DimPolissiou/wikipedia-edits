The descent stage would have housed the astronauts, life-support equipment, and fuel for the ascent-stage motor and steering rockets. Like the Apollo LM, the Altair's crew cabin was based on that of a cylinder. Initially a horizontal cylinder, like that of the LM (despite the \"boxy\" appearance on the outside), current blueprints and computer simulations show the use of a vertical cylinder.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Unlike its two-man Apollo ancestor, Altair was designed to carry the entire four-person crew to the surface, while the temporarily unoccupied [[Orion (spacecraft)|Orion]] crew module would have remained in lunar orbit.\n\nAltair was intended to be capable of operating away from Earth (in space and on the lunar surface) for up to 210 Earth days.<ref name=\"NewAltair\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.nasa.gov/externalflash/constellation_projects/\n| year = 2009\n| author = NASA\n| title = Constellation Accomplishments\n| publisher = NASA\n| accessdate = 2009-06-18| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090621083300/http://www.nasa.gov/externalflash/constellation_projects/| archivedate= 21 June 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> Altair would also be capable of flying unmanned missions,<ref name=\"NewAltair\" /> as had been proposed with [[Apollo Lunar Module#LM Truck|LM Truck]] concept during the [[Apollo Applications Program]]. Mission planners would have been able to choose among three distinct mission modes for Altair:<ref name=\"NewAltair\" />\n# Crewed sortie mode\n# Crewed outpost mode (with no airlock)\n# Uncrewed cargo mode, capable of transporting up to 15 metric tons to the lunar surface\n[[File:Altair in rocket fairing.jpg|left|thumb|Artist's rendering of Altair being encased in a shroud]]\nAltair, like the LM, was planned to have two hatches; one on top for docking and internal transfer between Altair and Orion, and a main hatch for accessing the lunar surface. Unlike the Apollo LM, Altair would have an airlock similar to those on the [[Space Shuttle]] and the [[International Space Station]] between the cabin and main hatch. The airlock allowed the astronauts to don and doff their [[spacesuit]]s without tracking [[Lunar soil#Harmful effects of lunar dust|potentially hazardous moon rocks]] into the main cabin and allowed the vehicle to retain its internal pressure.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Unlike the Apollo LM, in which the entire cabin was depressurized during [[extra-vehicular activity]], the airlock would allow a crew member with a malfunctioning spacesuit to quickly return to the Altair spacecraft without having to terminate the entire EVA, and allowed the landing party to complete most of their tasks during their 7-day lunar stay. Also, the airlock would remain as part of the Altair's descent stage, allowing NASA to utilize the airlock as a component of the Lunar Outpost.\n\nBecause the [[Ares V]] payload shroud was planned to have a diameter of {{Convert|33|ft|m}} and height of {{Convert|49|ft|m}} (including landing gear), the landers were designed to retract so as to fit within the Ares V's payload shroud.\n\nThe spacecraft would also have included an improved miniature camping-style toilet, similar to the unit now used on the ISS and the Russian [[Soyuz spacecraft]], a food warmer to eliminate the \"cold soup\" menu used during Apollo missions, a laser-guided distance measurement system (with radar backup), using data acquired by advanced unmanned lunar orbiting spacecraft, and new \"[[glass cockpit]]\" and [[Boeing 787]]-based computer system identical to that on the Orion spacecraft.\n\n=== Engines ===\n[[File:Altair - cargo mode.jpg|right|thumb|200 px|Cargo variant of Altair]]\nAltair intended to utilize current [[cryogenic fuel|cryogenic]] technologies for the descent stages and [[Hypergolic propellant|hypergolic]] technologies for the ascent stage. The Apollo LM, as advanced in both computer and engineering technology in its day, used hypergolic fuels in both of its stages, chemicals that combust on contact with each other, requiring no ignition mechanism and allowing an indefinite storage period. Both the cryogenic and hypergolic systems, like that of the Apollo LM, would be force-fed using high-pressure [[helium]], eliminating the need for malfunction-prone pumps utilized in most rocket technology.\n\nMission requirements obliged the vehicle to be able to descend from an equatorial or high-inclination lunar orbit to a polar landing site, along with bringing it and the Orion spacecraft into lunar orbit, as the Orion spacecraft's onboard [[Aerojet]] [[AJ10|AJ-10]] rocket engine and the amount of fuel it carried would have been insufficient to brake the Orion/Altair stack into lunar orbit (also necessary if flown without Orion for cargo-only missions). The new lander would have been powered by a modified [[RL-10]] engine (currently in use on the upper stage of the [[Delta IV rocket]] and [[Centaur (rocket)|Centaur]] upper stage of the [[Atlas V]] rocket), burning [[liquid hydrogen]] (LH<sub>2</sub>) and [[liquid oxygen]] (LOX) for the descent phase. A single [[AJ10|AJ-10]] rocket engine, like that on the Orion, was intended to power the ascent stage.\n\nOriginally, NASA wanted to power the ascent stage using LOX and liquid [[methane]] (LCH<sub>4</sub>), [[RS-18]], as future missions to [[Mars]] would require the astronauts to live on the planet. The [[Sabatier process|Sabatier Reactor]] could be used to convert the carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) found on Mars into methane, using either found or transported hydrogen, a [[catalyst]], and a source of heat. Cost overruns and immature LOX/LCH<sub>4</sub> rocket technology forced NASA to stick with cryogenic and hypergolic systems, although later variants of Altair were meant to serve as testbeds for methane rockets and Sabatier reactors after a permanent lunar base was established.\n\n== On-orbit assembly ==\nBecause of the spacecraft's size and weight, Altair, and its associated [[Earth Departure Stage]], would have been launched into a low-Earth orbit ([[Low Earth orbit|LEO]]) using the heavy-lift [[Ares V]] launch vehicle, followed by a separate launch of an Orion spacecraft lifted by an [[Ares I]]. After rendezvous and docking with Altair in LEO, the crew would have then configured the Orion/Altair for the journey to the Moon.\n\n== Offices and development ==\nThe development of Altair would have been managed by the Constellation Lunar Lander Project Office at [[Johnson Space Center]] (JSC). JSC worked directly with Apollo astronauts, various industry suppliers and universities to develop the architecture for Altair. In conjunction with early development a mockup or testbed was to have been developed at JSC to study/develop specialized subsystems and other design considerations. [[Northrop Grumman]], which built the Apollo Lunar Module, was contracted to help the project office develop the system concept.<ref>{{cite web|title=Northrop Grumman Helps NASA Shape Plans for Affordable Lunar Lander|url=http://www.irconnect.com/noc/press/pages/news_releases.html?d=122412|publisher=irconnect.com|accessdate=2007-07-17}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of crewed lunar lander designs]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Include-NASA}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Altair (lander)|Altair}}\n* [http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/289914main_fs_altair_lunar_lander.pdf Altair Lunar Lander Fact Sheet]\n* [http://www.thespacereview.com/article/502/1 Space Review]\n* [http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/systems/lsam.htm Globalsecurity]\n* [http://microgravity.grc.nasa.gov/Advanced/Capabilities/PCAD/ Propulsion and Cryogenic Advanced Development for Altair]\n\n{{Project Constellation}}\n{{Moon spacecraft}}\n{{Manned lunar spacecraft}}\n{{NASA navbox}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Altair (Spacecraft)}}\n[[Category:Crewed spacecraft]]\n[[Category:Constellation program]]\n[[Category:Cancelled spacecraft]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Planned lander spacecraft component of NASA's cancelled Project Constellation}}\n{{about|the Lunar lander|the communication satellites|Luch (satellite)}}\n{{Infobox spaceflight\n| names_list            = Lunar Surface Access Module (LSAM)\n| image                 = Altair-Lander (latest).jpg\n| image_caption         = Artist's impression of the crewed version of Altair on the surface of the moon\n| operator              = [[NASA]]\n| spacecraft_type       = Lander\n| launch_mass           = {{cvt|45864|kg}}\n| payload_mass          = {{cvt|14500|kg}}\n| crew_size             = 4\n| launch_rocket         = [[Ares V]]\n| launch_site           = [[Kennedy Space Center|Kennedy]] [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39#39B|LC-39B]]\n| orbit_reference       = [[Selenocentric orbit|Selenocentric]]\n| apsis                 = cynthion\n| programme             = [[Constellation program]]\n| insignia              = Altair spacecraft logo.jpg\n}}\n\nThe '''Altair''' spacecraft, previously known as the '''Lunar Surface Access Module''' or '''LSAM''', was the planned [[lander (spacecraft)|lander spacecraft]] component of [[NASA|NASA's]] cancelled [[Constellation program]].

Sandberg]] from a screenplay by Henry Gayden, and a story by Gayden and [[Darren Lemke]], the film stars [[Asher Angel]] as Billy Batson, a teenage boy who can transform into an adult superhero, played by [[Zachary Levi]]. [[Mark Strong]], [[Jack Dylan Grazer]], [[Adam Brody]], and [[Djimon Hounsou]] also star. The plot follows Billy Batson, who is chosen by the ancient wizard [[Shazam (wizard)|Shazam]] as his new champion and receives various superpowers.

The film went into pre-production in 2009 with director [[Peter Segal]] and writer [[John August]] and [[Dwayne Johnson]] considered to star as the villain [[Black Adam]], but the project fell through; Dwayne Johnson acts as an executive producer on ''Shazam!''. [[William Goldman]], [[Alec Sokolow]], [[Joel Cohen (writer)|Joel Cohen]], Bill Birch, and [[Geoff Johns]], among others, were all attached to the project as writers at various points. The film was officially announced in 2014, with Johnson attached to star as either Shazam or Black Adam. He would later be cast in January 2017 to lead a solo ''Black Adam'' development project, currently targeted for a December 2021 release.<ref name=\"BlackAdamRelease\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/black-adam-release-date-set-2021-1254807 |title=Dwayne Johnson's 'Black Adam' Sets 2021 Release Date |website=The Hollywood Reporter |language=en |access-date=2019-11-19}}</ref> Sandberg signed on to direct ''Shazam!'' in February 2017 and Levi was cast that October, with Angel joining the following month.

There, the ancient wizard [[Shazam (wizard)|Shazam]] has spent centuries searching for someone pure of heart on whom to bestow his power and name as champion, after the previous champion released the [[Seven Deadly Enemies of Man|Seven Deadly Sins]] which killed the rest of the Council of Wizards. Thaddeus is tempted by the Eye of Sin, through which he hears the voices of the Sins, trapped in stone statues, promising him power if he will free them. The wizard deems Thaddeus unworthy and magically returns him to the car, where he makes a scene causing a car crash, crippling his father. The Sins send Thaddeus a message telling him to find them.\n\nIn present-day [[Philadelphia]], 14-year-old foster child [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Billy Batson]] continually runs away from foster homes to search for his birth mother, from whom he became separated while at a carnival ten years prior. He is placed in a group home run by Victor and Rosa Vasquez, with five other foster children: [[Mary Marvel|Mary Bromfield]], Pedro Pe\u00f1a, Eugene Choi, Darla Dudley, and superhero enthusiast [[Captain Marvel Jr.|Freddy Freeman]]. Meanwhile, the embittered Sivana succeeds in his lifelong quest to find a way back to the Rock of Eternity. He steals the Eye of Sin, becoming the Sins' vessel, bests the wizard, and uses his newfound power to kill his father, brother, and Sivana Industries' board of directors.\n\nAt school, Billy defends Freddy from bullies and is chased into a subway, where he is transported to the Rock of Eternity. The wizard chooses Billy to be his new champion: By saying the name \"Shazam\", Billy is transformed into an adult superhero. The wizard turns to dust, leaving his magical staff behind. At home, Freddy is taken into Billy's confidence and helps him explore his newfound powers, which include super strength, speed, near-invulnerability, and electricity manipulation. By saying \"Shazam\" again, he can transform back into his normal body. Freddy posts [[viral video]]s of the new superhero, and Billy starts skipping school to use his powers to [[street performance|busk]] for money and fame, straining his friendship with Freddy. When Billy accidentally endangers and then saves a bus full of people, Sivana confronts him, demanding that he surrender his powers. Billy discovers that he can fly, and manages to escape. His foster siblings deduce that he is the superhero, and complete his search for his mother, who lives nearby. Billy rushes to see her, but is disheartened to learn that she abandoned him, having felt inadequate to raise him as a single teenage mother.\n\nSivana deduces Billy's identity and takes his foster siblings hostage. Billy agrees to transfer his powers to Sivana in exchange for their safety. They go to the Rock of Eternity to use the wizard's staff to effect the transfer, but the children follow and attack Sivana. Billy observes that Sivana becomes vulnerable when all seven Sins leave his body. Sivana pursues them to a winter carnival and unleashes the Sins upon the crowd. Remembering the wizard's words, Billy uses the staff to share his powers with his siblings, transforming them into [[Marvel Family|adult superheroes like him]]. He then breaks the staff, and his siblings battle the Sins while Billy faces down Sivana. By luring out the final Sin, Envy, Billy makes Sivana vulnerable and yanks the Eye of Sin out of his head, recapturing all the Sins.\n\nBilly and his siblings are hailed as heroes, return the Eye and the Sins to their prison, and realize they can use the Rock of Eternity as their superhero lair. Billy finally accepts his foster parents and siblings as his \"real\" family. In his superhero form, he has lunch with his siblings at school, revealing to Freddy's surprise that he has also invited [[Superman]]. In a [[post-credits scene|mid-credits scene]], the imprisoned Sivana is approached by [[Mister Mind|a talking caterpillar]], who proposes [[Monster Society of Evil|an alliance]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{See also|Marvel Family}}\n* [[Asher Angel]] as [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Billy Batson]], a troubled orphan searching for his biological mother, who is chosen by the ancient wizard Shazam as his champion.

Four major sequences take place here, including the opening scene when a young Thad enters and is rejected as the new hero; when he returns as the older Dr. Sivana; when Billy enters and becomes Shazam; and the final showdown between Shazam and Sivana. VFX Supervisor Aaron Weintraub and the team at Mr. X were brought on board three months before shooting began in Toronto \u2013 where the town was abuzz with this exciting project and the mayor talked it up frequently. Weintraub found working with Sandberg and the filmmaking team to be an open, inviting, and collaborative experience.\n\nWhile the first level of the Rock of Eternity was an elaborately built set, everything above 20 feet was a digital environment extension, and within that was every type of visual effect \u2013 from bringing Shazam's chest bolt to life; to stunts with digi-doubles, people melting and statues crumbling; to the Orb and the Seven Deadly Sins flying in and out of it. the final showdown between Shazam and Sivana, in which the latter lets loose his gang of monsters, a 360 shot where seven creatures form from smoke unleashed from within.\n\nRodeo FX team deliver more than 130 shots to DC's latest entry, Shazam!. RodeoFX team recreate the city backdrop for the boardroom sequence. Using photographs of Pittsburgh, They built matte paintings of the city as seen from the boardroom, adding buildings and bustlings streets.\n\nFor the title sequence, They delivered the compositing of the company logos in the opening credits and built and animated the magic 8 ball in CG, adding frost and rays of light beam along matching the effects from the key subway scene from the film.\n\nDigital Domain worked on 26 VFX shots for the movie.

''''' is a 2019 American [[superhero film]] based on the [[DC Comics]] [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|character]]. Produced by [[New Line Cinema]] and distributed by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]], it is the seventh installment in the [[DC Extended Universe]] (DCEU). Directed by [[David F. Sandberg]] from a screenplay by Henry Gayden, and a story by Gayden and [[Darren Lemke]], the film stars [[Asher Angel]] as Billy Batson, a teenage boy who can transform into an adult superhero, played by [[Zachary Levi]]. [[Mark Strong]], [[Jack Dylan Grazer]], [[Adam Brody]], and [[Djimon Hounsou]] also star. The plot follows Billy Batson, who is chosen by the ancient wizard [[Shazam (wizard)|Shazam]] as his new champion and receives various superpowers. Billy and his best friend [[Captain Marvel, Jr.|Freddy Freeman]] (Grazer) must discover Billy's new powers in order to stop the evil [[Doctor Sivana|Dr. Thaddeus Sivana]] (Strong) and the [[Seven Deadly Enemies of Man]].\n\nDevelopment of a live-action ''Shazam!'' film began at New Line in the early 2000s but was delayed for many years. The film went into pre-production in 2009 with director [[Peter Segal]] and writer [[John August]] and [[Dwayne Johnson]] considered to star as the villain [[Black Adam]], but the project fell through; Dwayne Johnson acts as an executive producer on ''Shazam!''. [[William Goldman]], [[Alec Sokolow]], [[Joel Cohen (writer)|Joel Cohen]], Bill Birch, and [[Geoff Johns]], among others, were all attached to the project as writers at various points. The film was officially announced in 2014, with Johnson attached to star as either Shazam or Black Adam. He would later be cast in January 2017 to lead a solo ''Black Adam'' development project, currently targeted for a December 2021 release.<ref name=\"BlackAdamRelease\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/black-adam-release-date-set-2021-1254807 |title=Dwayne Johnson's 'Black Adam' Sets 2021 Release Date |website=The Hollywood Reporter |language=en |access-date=2019-11-19}}</ref> Sandberg signed on to direct ''Shazam!'' in February 2017 and Levi was cast that October, with Angel joining the following month. [[Principal photography]] began in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada on January 29, 2018, with most of the film shot at [[Pinewood Toronto Studios]], and [[Wrap (filmmaking)|wrapped]] on May 11, 2018.\n\n''Shazam!'' was released in the United States by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] in [[RealD 3D]], [[Dolby Cinema]], [[IMAX 3D]], [[4DX]] and [[ScreenX]] <!--no IMAX 2D prints--> on April 5, 2019. The film grossed $366 million worldwide, making it  a box office success. The film received positive reviews from critics, with praise for Sandberg's direction and the performances of Levi, Grazer, and Angel, as well as its light tone and sense of fun.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/shazam-reviews-what-critics-are-saying-1196688|title='Shazam!': What the Critics Are Saying|author=Katie Kilkenny|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=March 23, 2019|accessdate=March 23, 2019}}</ref> A sequel is set for release on April 1, 2022.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the word count in this section should be 400-700 words. -->\nIn 1974 [[Upstate New York]], young [[Doctor Sivana|Thaddeus Sivana]] is riding in a car with his father and brother when he is suddenly transported to the [[Rock of Eternity]], a magical temple in another dimension. There, the ancient wizard [[Shazam (wizard)|Shazam]] has spent centuries searching for someone pure of heart on whom to bestow his power and name as champion, after the previous champion released the [[Seven Deadly Enemies of Man|Seven Deadly Sins]] which killed the rest of the Council of Wizards. Thaddeus is tempted by the Eye of Sin, through which he hears the voices of the Sins, trapped in stone statues, promising him power if he will free them. The wizard deems Thaddeus unworthy and magically returns him to the car, where he makes a scene causing a car crash, crippling his father. The Sins send Thaddeus a message telling him to find them.\n\nIn present-day [[Philadelphia]], 14-year-old foster child [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Billy Batson]] continually runs away from foster homes to search for his birth mother, from whom he became separated while at a carnival ten years prior. He is placed in a group home run by Victor and Rosa Vasquez, with five other foster children: [[Mary Marvel|Mary Bromfield]], Pedro Pe\u00f1a, Eugene Choi, Darla Dudley, and superhero enthusiast [[Captain Marvel Jr.|Freddy Freeman]]. Meanwhile, the embittered Sivana succeeds in his lifelong quest to find a way back to the Rock of Eternity. He steals the Eye of Sin, becoming the Sins' vessel, bests the wizard, and uses his newfound power to kill his father, brother, and Sivana Industries' board of directors.\n\nAt school, Billy defends Freddy from bullies and is chased into a subway, where he is transported to the Rock of Eternity. The wizard chooses Billy to be his new champion: By saying the name \"Shazam\", Billy is transformed into an adult superhero. The wizard turns to dust, leaving his magical staff behind. At home, Freddy is taken into Billy's confidence and helps him explore his newfound powers, which include super strength, speed, near-invulnerability, and electricity manipulation. By saying \"Shazam\" again, he can transform back into his normal body. Freddy posts [[viral video]]s of the new superhero, and Billy starts skipping school to use his powers to [[street performance|busk]] for money and fame, straining his friendship with Freddy. When Billy accidentally endangers and then saves a bus full of people, Sivana confronts him, demanding that he surrender his powers. Billy discovers that he can fly, and manages to escape. His foster siblings deduce that he is the superhero, and complete his search for his mother, who lives nearby. Billy rushes to see her, but is disheartened to learn that she abandoned him, having felt inadequate to raise him as a single teenage mother.\n\nSivana deduces Billy's identity and takes his foster siblings hostage. Billy agrees to transfer his powers to Sivana in exchange for their safety. They go to the Rock of Eternity to use the wizard's staff to effect the transfer, but the children follow and attack Sivana. Billy observes that Sivana becomes vulnerable when all seven Sins leave his body. Sivana pursues them to a winter carnival and unleashes the Sins upon the crowd. Remembering the wizard's words, Billy uses the staff to share his powers with his siblings, transforming them into [[Marvel Family|adult superheroes like him]]. He then breaks the staff, and his siblings battle the Sins while Billy faces down Sivana. By luring out the final Sin, Envy, Billy makes Sivana vulnerable and yanks the Eye of Sin out of his head, recapturing all the Sins.\n\nBilly and his siblings are hailed as heroes, return the Eye and the Sins to their prison, and realize they can use the Rock of Eternity as their superhero lair. Billy finally accepts his foster parents and siblings as his \"real\" family. In his superhero form, he has lunch with his siblings at school, revealing to Freddy's surprise that he has also invited [[Superman]]. In a [[post-credits scene|mid-credits scene]], the imprisoned Sivana is approached by [[Mister Mind|a talking caterpillar]], who proposes [[Monster Society of Evil|an alliance]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{See also|Marvel Family}}\n* [[Asher Angel]] as [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Billy Batson]], a troubled orphan searching for his biological mother, who is chosen by the ancient wizard Shazam as his champion.

Four major sequences take place here, including the opening scene when a young Thad enters and is rejected as the new hero; when he returns as the older Dr. Sivana; when Billy enters and becomes Shazam; and the final showdown between Shazam and Sivana. VFX Supervisor Aaron Weintraub and the team at Mr. X were brought on board three months before shooting began in Toronto \u2013 where the town was abuzz with this exciting project and the mayor talked it up frequently. Weintraub found working with Sandberg and the filmmaking team to be an open, inviting, and collaborative experience.\n\nWhile the first level of the Rock of Eternity was an elaborately built set, everything above 20 feet was a digital environment extension, and within that was every type of visual effect \u2013 from bringing Shazam's chest bolt to life; to stunts with digi-doubles, people melting and statues crumbling; to the Orb and the Seven Deadly Sins flying in and out of it. the final showdown between Shazam and Sivana, in which the latter lets loose his gang of monsters, a 360 shot where seven creatures form from smoke unleashed from within.\n\nRodeo FX team deliver more than 130 shots to DC's latest entry, Shazam!. RodeoFX team recreate the city backdrop for the boardroom sequence. Using photographs of Pittsburgh, They built matte paintings of the city as seen from the boardroom, adding buildings and bustlings streets.\n\nFor the title sequence, They delivered the compositing of the company logos in the opening credits and built and animated the magic 8 ball in CG, adding frost and rays of light beam along matching the effects from the key subway scene from the film.\n\nDigital Domain worked on 26 VFX shots for the movie. Additionally Rise FX and DNEG provide visual effects for the film and the 3D conversion.\n\n==Music==\n{{main|Shazam!
