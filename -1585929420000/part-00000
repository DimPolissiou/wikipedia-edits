Later, in 2018, Taylor and Blumhouse Productions began developing the film, with Taylor directing, Landes writing, Blum producing and Spencer starring it. [[Principal photography]] on the film started in February 2018 and wrapped in March 2018, in [[Mississippi]], with parts shot in [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]].\n\n''Ma'' was released in the United States on May 31, 2019, by [[Universal Pictures]]. It has grossed $61.1 million worldwide and received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the atmosphere, the horror elements and Spencer's performance, but criticized the teenage characters, slow pacing and story. Both critics and audiences said the film did not take full advantage of its premise.\n\n==Plot==\nTeenager Maggie Thompson moves with her mother Erica to her [[Ohio]] hometown after Erica's husband leaves her. At her new high school, Maggie befriends Haley, Darrell, Chaz, and Andy, who immediately develops a crush on her. They convince Sue Ann \"Ma\" Ellington, a [[veterinary technician]], to [[Shoulder tap (alcohol)|help them buy alcohol]] because they are underage. Sue Ann anonymously reports the teenagers' activities, but they are released because of the officer's history with Andy's father, Ben. The next day, Sue Ann invites the teenagers to drink in her basement. The next time they go, Sue Ann has decorated her basement and lots of other teenagers show up at her house to party, making her popular among the students.\n\nHowever, her hospitality starts to annoy the group as she continuously harasses them to engage in various activities with her. One night, Sue Ann sees Andy and Maggie kissing and becomes jealous (as she is in love with him, having had a crush on his father, Ben, in high school). She drugs Maggie immediately after and takes her earrings. The next morning, Maggie wakes up and notices her earrings are missing and is badly bruised and cut. Scared, Maggie tells Andy that she does not want to go to her house anymore and that she does not want him to go as well and he agrees.\n\nOne day to earn the group's trust back, Ma meets with them to tell them that she has [[pancreatic cancer]] (which is a lie) and that is why she acts the way she does. As she is talking, Haley notices that she is wearing a bracelet that belongs to a friend of theirs. The girls suspect that Sue Ann has been stealing their jewelry so they go to her house to investigate. They are surprised by Genie, Sue Ann's daughter from a failed marriage, who Maggie thought used a wheelchair, but she is clearly able-bodied. She warns them as Sue Ann arrives home, and they narrowly escape.\n\nBen warns Sue Ann to stay away from Andy, calling her pathetic. A flashback reveals that Sue Ann, who had a crush on Ben in high school, performed [[fellatio]] on him in a closet. Once she left the closet, it turned out that she had been doing it to another boy and Ben had tricked her. Ben had gotten the entire school to witness the event (including his current girlfriend Mercedes and a young Erica), and Sue Ann suffered devastating humiliation, which she never recovered from.\n\nBen shows up at Sue Ann's job, to drop off his car and invites her out for drinks after work. Sue Ann goes home to change and meets him at the bar, where Ben confronts Sue Ann with a tracking device and asks her why his son has been at her house so much. \n\nAn increasingly unstable Sue Ann runs over Mercedes with her truck, killing her. She kills her boss, draws blood from Maggie's dog Louie, and lures Ben to her house, where she knocks him out. Ben wakes up trapped in her bed; Sue Ann pumps Louie's blood into his body, slashes his wrist, and leaves him to die. Maggie tells her mother the truth about Sue Ann and is grounded. Sue Ann sends Maggie a picture of herself with Andy in her basement at Chaz's birthday party. Hurt that he went back to her house despite promising that he would not go back, she sneaks out of the house to confront him. When she arrives, she notices that everyone has left and that only the original group remain. She tries to get Andy to leave but soon realizes that Andy and the rest of her friends have been drugged. Maggie tries to get help and in the process finds Ben's body. As she stands there in horror, Sue Ann renders her unconscious.\n\nMaggie awakens chained in the basement. Sue Ann irons Chaz's stomach, sews Haley's mouth shut, and paints Darrell's face white with industrial paint, because she feels there is only room for one black person in the group, and that is her. Andy awakens, and tries to seduce Sue Ann, as he is well aware that she is in love with him. He tries to trick her by telling her that he loves her and kisses her but she stabs him after knowing that he is lying. An officer arrives and when Maggie screams for help, Sue Ann shoots the officer dead before he can react. She then gathers the four friends around the couch with her and makes Maggie take photos of them together in a crude recreation of what Sue Ann always longed for but never had. Sue Ann then leaves Maggie to be hanged before Genie intervenes. Everyone else wakes up to discover what Sue Ann has done to them but barely have time to react as the house is on fire and need to find a way out. Erica, knowing where Maggie would be, calls her co-worker Stu for help and the two save the teenagers. Sue Ann attempts to throw Genie into the fire, blaming Erica for not stopping Ben from pulling the prank in school. Maggie stabs Sue Ann, saving Genie.\n\nThe group goes outside and assess what has happened. Sue Ann watches them, particularly Andy who survived the stabbing and is lying down next to Maggie. Sue Ann walks upstairs and lies down next to Ben's body, cuddling with it as the house burns.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Octavia Spencer]] as Sue Ann \"Ma\" Ellington\n** Kyanna Simone Simpson as young Sue Ann\n* [[Diana Silvers]] as Maggie Thompson\n* [[McKaley Miller]] as Haley, Maggie's friend\n* Corey Fogelmanis as Andy Hawkins, Maggie\u2019s boyfriend\n* [[Juliette Lewis]] as Erica Thompson\n** Teagan Edsell  as young Erica\n* [[Luke Evans]] as Ben Hawkins\n** Andrew Matthew Welch as young Ben\n* Gianni Paolo as Chaz, Maggie's friend\n* Dante Brown as Darrell, Maggie's friend\n* [[Missi Pyle]] as Mercedes, Ben's girlfriend\n** Nicole Carpenter as young Mercedes \n* Tanyell Waivers as Genie Ellington\n* [[Allison Janney]] as Dr. Brooks, Sue Ann's boss\n* [[Dominic Burgess]] as Stu, Erica's co-worker\n* Heather Marie Pate as Ashley\n* [[Tate Taylor]] as Officer Grainger\n* Victor Turpin as Pietro Kramer\n* Margaret Fegan as Stephanie\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n''Ma'' came together as a result of [[Tate Taylor]]'s desire to direct a film about \"something fucked up,\" and a conversation he had with [[Octavia Spencer]] in which she told him that she was \"sick of only being offered the same role and never getting to be a lead.\"<ref name=indiewire1/> The two are longtime friends, having worked together in films such as ''[[The Help (film)|The Help]]'' and ''[[Get on Up (film)|Get on Up]]''.<ref name=indiewire1/> [[Jason Blum]] and Taylor, who have been friends for a few years, knew each other socially.<ref name=gq/>\n\nTaylor went to Blum's office, reiterating, \"I want to do something really fucked up.\"<ref name=gq/> He read Scotty Landes' script of the film, which [[Blumhouse Productions]] had bought the day before.<ref name=gq/> Although the original draft was written with a white woman in the title role, Taylor immediately thought about Spencer.<ref name=indiewire1/> He went out to the hall, called Spencer, and asked her if she would like to be in a horror film;<ref name=gq/> without reading the script, Spencer boarded the project.<ref name=gq>{{cite web|url=https://www.gq.com/story/ma-tate-taylor-interview|title=The Director of Ma Will Not Let You Pee|work=[[GQ]]|first=Max|last=Cea|date=May 30, 2019|accessdate=May 30, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThere was no backstory for the title character in the original script, which made her \"a complete monster that no audience member could sympathize with.\"<ref name=indiewire1/> The filmmakers made it a priority to come up with an authentic backstory for the role.<ref name=indiewire1>{{cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/05/ma-octavia-spencer-pitch-black-person-killed-first-1202145955/|title=Octavia Spencer Got Pitched 'Ma' and Asked: 'Am I the Black Person Who Gets Killed First?'|work=[[IndieWire]]|first=Zack|last=Sharf|date=May 30, 2019|accessdate=May 30, 2019}}</ref> Taylor thought it was important to weave the themes of trauma, the sins of our parents, and how we treat people into the story to create a character audiences can relate to and feel bad for.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/05/ma-octavia-spencer-pitch-black-person-killed-first-1202145955/|title=Octavia Spencer Got Pitched \u2018Ma\u2019 and Asked: \u2018Am I the Black Person Who Gets Killed First?\u2019|last=Sharf|first=Zack|date=2019-05-30|website=IndieWire|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-06}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\n[[Principal photography]] on the film started in February 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2018/02/octavia-spencer-ma-blumhouse-tate-taylor-movie-juliette-lewis-luke-evans-1202276253/|title=Octavia Spencer To Star In Blumhouse Thriller 'Ma';

Sue Ann anonymously reports the teenagers' activities, but they are released because of the officer's history with Andy's father, Ben. The next day, Sue Ann invites the teenagers to drink in her basement. The next time they go, Sue Ann has decorated her basement and lots of other teenagers show up at her house to party, making her popular among the students.\n\nHowever, her hospitality starts to annoy the group as she continuously harasses them to engage in various activities with her. One night, Sue Ann sees Andy and Maggie kissing and becomes jealous (as she is in love with him, having had a crush on his father, Ben, in high school). She drugs Maggie immediately after and takes her earrings. The next morning, Maggie wakes up and notices her earrings are missing and is badly bruised and cut. Scared, Maggie tells Andy that she does not want to go to her house anymore and that she does not want him to go as well and he agrees.\n\nOne day to earn the group's trust back, Ma meets with them to tell them that she has [[pancreatic cancer]] (which is a lie) and that is why she acts the way she does. As she is talking, Haley notices that she is wearing a bracelet that belongs to a friend of theirs. The girls suspect that Sue Ann has been stealing their jewelry so they go to her house to investigate. They are surprised by Genie, Sue Ann's daughter from a failed marriage, who Maggie thought used a wheelchair, but she is clearly able-bodied. She warns them as Sue Ann arrives home, and they narrowly escape.\n\nBen warns Sue Ann to stay away from Andy, calling her pathetic. A flashback reveals that Sue Ann, who had a crush on Ben in high school, performed [[fellatio]] on him in a closet. Once she left the closet, it turned out that she had been doing it to another boy and Ben had tricked her. Ben had gotten the entire school to witness the event (including his current girlfriend Mercedes and a young Erica), and Sue Ann suffered devastating humiliation, which she never recovered from.\n\nBen shows up at Sue Ann\u2019s job, to drop off his car and invites her out for drinks after work. Sue Ann goes home to change and meets him at the bar, where Ben confronts Sue Ann with a tracking device and asks her why his son has been at her house so much. \n\nAn increasingly unstable Sue Ann runs over Mercedes with her truck, killing her. She kills her boss, draws blood from Maggie's dog Louie, and lures Ben to her house, where she knocks him out. Ben wakes up trapped in her bed; Sue Ann pumps Louie's blood into his body, slashes his wrist, and leaves him to die. Maggie tells her mother the truth about Sue Ann and is grounded. Sue Ann sends Maggie a picture of herself with Andy in her basement at Chaz's birthday party. Hurt that he went back to her house despite promising that he would not go back, she sneaks out of the house to confront him. When she arrives, she notices that everyone has left and that only the original group remain. She tries to get Andy to leave but soon realizes that Andy and the rest of her friends have been drugged. Maggie tries to get help and in the process finds Ben's body. As she stands there in horror, Sue Ann renders her unconscious.\n\nMaggie awakens chained in the basement. Sue Ann irons Chaz's stomach, sews Haley's mouth shut, and paints Darrell's face white with industrial paint, because she feels there is only room for one black person in the group, and that is her. Andy awakens, and tries to seduce Sue Ann, as he is well aware that she is in love with him. He tries to trick her by telling her that he loves her and kisses her but she stabs him after knowing that he is lying. An officer arrives and when Maggie screams for help, Sue Ann shoots the officer dead before he can react. She then gathers the four friends around the couch with her and makes Maggie take photos of them together in a crude recreation of what Sue Ann always longed for but never had. Sue Ann then leaves Maggie to be hanged before Genie intervenes. Everyone else wakes up to discover what Sue Ann has done to them but barely have time to react as the house is on fire and need to find a way out. Erica, knowing where Maggie would be, calls her co-worker Stu for help and the two save the teenagers. Sue Ann attempts to throw Genie into the fire, blaming Erica for not stopping Ben from pulling the prank in school. Maggie stabs Sue Ann, saving Genie.\n\nThe group goes outside and assess what has happened. Sue Ann watches them, particularly Andy who survived the stabbing and is lying down next to Maggie. Sue Ann walks upstairs and lies down next to Ben's body, cuddling with it as the house burns.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Octavia Spencer]] as Sue Ann \"Ma\" Ellington\n** Kyanna Simone Simpson as young Sue Ann\n* [[Diana Silvers]] as Maggie Thompson\n* [[McKaley Miller]] as Haley, Maggie's friend\n* Corey Fogelmanis as Andy Hawkins, Maggie\u2019s boyfriend\n* [[Juliette Lewis]] as Erica Thompson\n** Teagan Edsell  as young Erica\n* [[Luke Evans]] as Ben Hawkins\n** Andrew Matthew Welch as young Ben\n* Gianni Paolo as Chaz, Maggie's friend\n* Dante Brown as Darrell, Maggie's friend\n* [[Missi Pyle]] as Mercedes, Ben's girlfriend\n** Nicole Carpenter as young Mercedes \n* Tanyell Waivers as Genie Ellington\n* [[Allison Janney]] as Dr. Brooks, Sue Ann's boss\n* [[Dominic Burgess]] as Stu, Erica's co-worker\n* Heather Marie Pate as Ashley\n* [[Tate Taylor]] as Officer Grainger\n* Victor Turpin as Pietro Kramer\n* Margaret Fegan as Stephanie\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n''Ma'' came together as a result of [[Tate Taylor]]'s desire to direct a film about \"something fucked up,\" and a conversation he had with [[Octavia Spencer]] in which she told him that she was \"sick of only being offered the same role and never getting to be a lead.\"<ref name=indiewire1/> The two are longtime friends, having worked together in films such as ''[[The Help (film)|The Help]]'' and ''[[Get on Up (film)|Get on Up]]''.<ref name=indiewire1/> [[Jason Blum]] and Taylor, who have been friends for a few years, knew each other socially.<ref name=gq/>\n\nTaylor went to Blum's office, reiterating, \"I want to do something really fucked up.\"<ref name=gq/> He read Scotty Landes' script of the film, which [[Blumhouse Productions]] had bought the day before.<ref name=gq/> Although the original draft was written with a white woman in the title role, Taylor immediately thought about Spencer.<ref name=indiewire1/> He went out to the hall, called Spencer, and asked her if she would like to be in a horror film;<ref name=gq/> without reading the script, Spencer boarded the project.<ref name=gq>{{cite web|url=https://www.gq.com/story/ma-tate-taylor-interview|title=The Director of Ma Will Not Let You Pee|work=[[GQ]]|first=Max|last=Cea|date=May 30, 2019|accessdate=May 30, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThere was no backstory for the title character in the original script, which made her \"a complete monster that no audience member could sympathize with.\"<ref name=indiewire1/> The filmmakers made it a priority to come up with an authentic backstory for the role.<ref name=indiewire1>{{cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/05/ma-octavia-spencer-pitch-black-person-killed-first-1202145955/|title=Octavia Spencer Got Pitched 'Ma' and Asked: 'Am I the Black Person Who Gets Killed First?'|work=[[IndieWire]]|first=Zack|last=Sharf|date=May 30, 2019|accessdate=May 30, 2019}}</ref> Taylor thought it was important to weave the themes of trauma, the sins of our parents, and how we treat people into the story to create a character audiences can relate to and feel bad for.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/05/ma-octavia-spencer-pitch-black-person-killed-first-1202145955/|title=Octavia Spencer Got Pitched \u2018Ma\u2019 and Asked: \u2018Am I the Black Person Who Gets Killed First?\u2019|last=Sharf|first=Zack|date=2019-05-30|website=IndieWire|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-06}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\n[[Principal photography]] on the film started in February 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2018/02/octavia-spencer-ma-blumhouse-tate-taylor-movie-juliette-lewis-luke-evans-1202276253/|title=Octavia Spencer To Star In Blumhouse Thriller 'Ma';

Tolkien|<span class=\"vcard\"><span class=\"fn\">J. R. R. Tolkien</span></span>'s]] [[Tolkien's legendarium|legendarium]]\n}}\n\nIn the fiction of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], '''Moria''' is an ancient mine under the [[Misty Mountains]]. Moria is introduced in Tolkien's novel ''[[The Hobbit]]'', and is a major scene of action in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.\n\nIn much of [[History of Arda|Middle-earth's fictional history]], Moria was the greatest city of [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|the Dwarves]]. The city's wealth was founded on its mines, which produced ''[[mithril]]'', a fictional metal of great beauty and strength, suitable for armour. The Dwarves dug too deep, greedy for ''mithril'', and disturbed a demon of great power: [[Durin's Bane|a Balrog]], which destroyed their kingdom. By the end of the [[Third Age]], Moria had long been abandoned by the Dwarves, and was a place of evil repute. It was dark, in dangerous disrepair, and in its labyrinths lurked [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orcs]] and the Balrog.\n\nScholars have identified likely sources for Tolkien's Moria: He had studied a Latin inscription about [[Ring of Silvianus|a lost ring]] at the temple of [[Nodens]] in Gloucestershire, at a place called Dwarf's Hill full of old mine-workings. The name Moria, Tolkien wrote, echoed the name of a castle in [[Norwegian Folktales|a Scandinavian folktale]], while Gandalf's death and reappearance reminded critics of the [[resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] and [[transfiguration of Jesus]]. The West Gate that crashes closed behind the [[Fellowship of the Ring (characters)|Fellowship]] recalled the [[Wandering Rocks]] of [[Greek mythology]], and [[Odysseus]]'s passage between the devouring [[Scylla]] and the whirlpool [[Charybdis]]. Finally, the Fellowship's entry into the darkness via the deadly lake by the West Gate, and its exit into the light via the beautiful Mirrormere, alongside Gandalf's death and reappearance, has been compared to a [[baptism]], a ceremony that combines a symbolic death and the gift of new life.\n\nMoria provided dramatic scenes in [[Peter Jackson]]'s film ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', inspired by [[Alan Lee (illustrator)|Alan Lee]]'s illustrations. Its multiple levels of tunnels and halls served, too, as the basis for a variety of computer and board games.\n\n==Names==\nTolkien uses [[Languages constructed by J. R. R. Tolkien|his constructed languages]] for the names for Moria in ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.\n\n''Moria'' is by far the most common name of the place in Tolkien's writings. The name means \"the Black Chasm\" or \"the Black Pit\", from [[Sindarin]] ''mor'', \"dark, black\" and ''i\u00e2'', \"void, abyss, pit\".<ref>[http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Moria Etymology of \"Moria\".]</ref> The element ''mor'' had the sense \"sinister, evil\", especially by association with infamous names such as ''[[Morgoth]]'' and ''[[Mordor]]''; indeed Moria itself had an evil reputation by the times in which ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'' are set.\n\nThe name ''Moria'' had (within the fiction) originally applied only to the Black Chasm itself. However, after the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]] were forced to abandon Khazad-d\u00fbm, its many bright lamps were destroyed, and the whole subterranean complex was drowned in darkness: a veritable Black Pit. Tolkien [[#Concept and creation|borrowed the name ''Moria'']] itself, but not its meaning, from a book he had read.<ref group=T>J. R. R. Tolkien (1981), ''[[The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien]]'', George Allen & Unwin, letter no. 297 (August 1967) p. 384; {{ISBN|0-04-826005-3}}</ref><ref>[[Wayne G. Hammond]] & [[Christina Scull]] (2005), ''[[The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion]]'', Harper Collins, p. 224 \"Moria\" {{ISBN|0 00 720308 X}}</ref>\n\n''Khazad-d\u00fbm'' is the second-commonest name, used for the fabulous city-kingdom of the Dwarves, especially in an historical or nostalgic context. In the fictional history, ''Khazad-d\u00fbm'' was Moria's original name, given by the Dwarves in [[Khuzdul|their own language, ''Khuzdul'']]. It is translated as the Dwarrowdelf, ''dwarrow'' being an archaic English form of \"dwarf\", and ''delf'' an archaic alternative to \"delving\", from the verb \"delve\", to dig.  Tolkien rhymes ''d\u00fbm'' with \"tomb\".<ref name=\"A Journey in the Dark\" group=T>{{harvnb|The Fellowship of the Ring|2002|loc=book 2, ch. 4 \"A Journey in the Dark\"}}</ref>\n\n==Tolkien's account==\n\n===Geography===\n[[File:Misty Mountain (59053312).jpeg|thumb|Mist on the [[Alps]]: Tolkien's experiences on his 1911 visit gave him the idea for difficulties crossing the Misty Mountains.<ref name=\"Letters #306\" group=T/>]]\n\nMoria was originally a system of natural caves located in Dimrill Dale, a valley on the eastern side of the Misty Mountains. Their genesis lay in the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'', with which Tolkien was familiar; the protagonist in the ''[[Sk\u00edrnism\u00e1l]]'' notes that his quest will involve misty mountains, [[Orc#Old English|orcs]], and giants.<ref>[[Tom Shippey]] (2005), ''[[The Road to Middle-earth]]'', Houghton Mifflin, ch. 3 pp. 80-81, {{ISBN|0-618-25760-8}}.</ref> The appearance of the Misty Mountains, and some of the experiences of Tolkien's protagonists, were inspired by his travels in the [[Swiss Alps]] in 1911.<ref name=\"Letters #306\" group=T>Humphrey Carpenter (1981, editor), ''[[Letters of J.

Three of the Misty Mountains' most massive peaks surrounded Dimrill Dale: the Mountains of Moria: ''Silvertine'' on the west; ''Redhorn'' on the north; and ''Cloudyhead'' on the east; or in [[Sindarin]] respectively ''Celebdil'', ''Caradhras'' and ''Fanuidhol''. Their [[Khuzd\u00fbl]] names, respectively ''Zirakzigil'', ''Barazinbar'' and ''Bundushath\u00fbr'', are mentioned by Gimli as the Fellowship nears Moria. The caves of Moria, where the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarf]] city-kingdom of Khazad-d\u00fbm was founded, were situated under Silvertine; their mouth overlooked Dimrill Dale, which contained many waterfalls and a long, oval lake that reflected stars even in daylight. Perceiving [[Durin's Crown|these stars]] as a crown glittering above his head, Durin took this as an auspicious sign, named the lake ''Kheled-z\u00e2ram'', the Mirrormere, and chose the eastward-facing caves above it for his new stronghold.<ref name=\"Lothl\u00f3rien\" group=T>{{harvnb|The Fellowship of the Ring|2002|loc=book 2, ch. 6 \"Lothl\u00f3rien\"}}</ref>\n\n====Geology====\n\nThe [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]] excavated most of Khazad-d\u00fbm out of solid rock, leaving polished walls.<ref name=\"A Journey in the Dark\" group=T/> Minerals included [[gold]], [[gem]]s and [[iron ore]]. However the principal mineral was ''[[mithril]]'', a fabulously precious and versatile metal found nowhere else in Middle-earth. It was the source of Khazad-d\u00fbm's huge wealth, but ultimately [[#The Mines|its mining]] was the cause of its downfall. Beginning under the Silvertine, the Dwarves mined ever deeper, and down towards the roots of Mount Caradhras. There they unearthed the Balrog, which drove the Dwarves into exile.<ref name=\"A Journey in the Dark\" group=T/>\n\nFar below even the deepest mines of the Dwarves lay a primordial underworld of tunnels, [[Subterranean river|streams]] and [[Underground lake|lakes]] in perpetual darkness, inhabited by primitive creatures.

Tolkien's drawing of the designs on the Doors of Durin was the only illustration in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' during his lifetime (other than cover-art and calligraphy). In moonlight, a password made the designs visible. The designs contained a second password to [[Open Sesame (phrase)#Classification|open the doors]]. When the Fellowship enter, the monstrous aquatic guardian of the gates slams the doors shut with its tentacles, plunging the Fellowship immediately into hellish darkness; the scholar of English literature Charles Huttar compares this \"clashing gate\" to the [[Wandering Rocks]] that in [[Greek mythology]] lie near the opening of the [[underworld]], [[Hades]], and to [[Odysseus]]'s passage between the devouring [[Scylla]] and the whirlpool [[Charybdis]].<ref name=\"Huttar 1975\">{{cite book |last=Huttar |first=Charles A. |editor-last=Lobdell |editor-first=Jared |title=Hell and the City: Tolkien and the Traditions of Western Literature |work=A Tolkien Compass |date=1975 |publisher=Open Court |isbn=978-0875483030 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/tolkiencompass00lobd/page/121 121\u2013122] |quote=Clearly Charybdis is yet another route to hell. |url=https://archive.org/details/tolkiencompass00lobd/page/121 }}</ref>{{-}}\n\n==Origins==\nIn 1928, a 4th-century pagan mystery cult temple was excavated at [[Lydney Park]], Gloucestershire.<ref>{{cite book |last=Shippey |first=Tom |authorlink=Tom Shippey |title=The Road to Middle-Earth |date=2005 |edition=Third |origyear=1982 |publisher=Grafton (HarperCollins) |isbn=978-0261102750 |pages=40\u201341}}</ref> Tolkien was asked to investigate a [[Latin]] inscription there: \"For the god [[Nodens]].

R. R. Tolkien]], '''Moria''', also named '''Khazad-d\u00fbm''', is an ancient subterranean complex in [[Middle-earth]], comprising a vast [[labyrinth]]ine network of tunnels, chambers, mines and halls under the [[Misty Mountains]], with doors on both the western and the eastern sides of the mountain range. Moria is introduced in Tolkien's novel ''[[The Hobbit]]'', and is a major scene of action in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.\n\nIn much of [[History of Arda|Middle-earth's fictional history]], Moria was the greatest city of [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|the Dwarves]]. The city's wealth was founded on its mines, which produced ''[[mithril]]'', a fictional metal of great beauty and strength, suitable for armour. The Dwarves dug too deep, greedy for ''mithril'', and disturbed a demon of great power: [[Durin's Bane|a Balrog]], which destroyed their kingdom. By the end of the [[Third Age]], Moria had long been abandoned by the Dwarves, and was a place of evil repute. It was dark, in dangerous disrepair, and in its labyrinths lurked [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orcs]] and the Balrog.\n\nScholars have identified likely sources for Tolkien's Moria: He had studied a Latin inscription about [[Ring of Silvianus|a lost ring]] at the temple of [[Nodens]] in Gloucestershire, at a place called Dwarf's Hill full of old mine-workings. The name Moria, Tolkien wrote, echoed the name of a castle in [[Norwegian Folktales|a Scandinavian folktale]], while Gandalf's death and reappearance reminded critics of the [[resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] and [[transfiguration of Jesus]]. The West Gate that crashes closed behind the [[Fellowship of the Ring (characters)|Fellowship]] recalled the [[Wandering Rocks]] of [[Greek mythology]], and [[Odysseus]]'s passage between the devouring [[Scylla]] and the whirlpool [[Charybdis]]. Finally, the Fellowship's entry into the darkness via the deadly lake by the West Gate, and its exit into the light via the beautiful Mirrormere, alongside Gandalf's death and reappearance, has been compared to a [[baptism]], a ceremony that combines a symbolic death and the gift of new life.\n\nMoria provided dramatic scenes in [[Peter Jackson]]'s film ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', inspired by [[Alan Lee (illustrator)|Alan Lee]]'s illustrations. Its multiple levels of tunnels and halls served, too, as the basis for a variety of computer and board games.\n\n==Names==\nTolkien uses [[Languages constructed by J. R. R. Tolkien|his constructed languages]] for the names for Moria in ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.\n\n''Moria'' is by far the most common name of the place in Tolkien's writings. The name means \"the Black Chasm\" or \"the Black Pit\", from [[Sindarin]] ''mor'', \"dark, black\" and ''i\u00e2'', \"void, abyss, pit\".<ref>[http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Moria Etymology of \"Moria\".]</ref> The element ''mor'' had the sense \"sinister, evil\", especially by association with infamous names such as ''[[Morgoth]]'' and ''[[Mordor]]''; indeed Moria itself had an evil reputation by the times in which ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'' are set.\n\nThe name ''Moria'' had (within the fiction) originally applied only to the Black Chasm itself. However, after the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]] were forced to abandon Khazad-d\u00fbm, its many bright lamps were destroyed, and the whole subterranean complex was drowned in darkness: a veritable Black Pit. Tolkien [[#Concept and creation|borrowed the name ''Moria'']] itself, but not its meaning, from a book he had read.<ref group=T>J. R. R. Tolkien (1981), ''[[The Letters of J. R. R.

In the fictional history, ''Khazad-d\u00fbm'' was Moria's original name, given by the Dwarves in [[Khuzdul|their own language, ''Khuzdul'']]. It is translated as the Dwarrowdelf, ''dwarrow'' being an archaic English form of \"dwarf\", and ''delf'' an archaic alternative to \"delving\", from the verb \"delve\", to dig.

Three of the Misty Mountains' most massive peaks surrounded Dimrill Dale: the Mountains of Moria: ''Silvertine'' on the west; ''Redhorn'' on the north; and ''Cloudyhead'' on the east; or in [[Sindarin]] respectively ''Celebdil'', ''Caradhras'' and ''Fanuidhol''. Their [[Khuzd\u00fbl]] names, respectively ''Zirakzigil'', ''Barazinbar'' and ''Bundushath\u00fbr'', are mentioned by Gimli as the Fellowship nears Moria. The caves of Moria, where the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarf]] city-kingdom of Khazad-d\u00fbm was founded, were situated under Silvertine; their mouth overlooked Dimrill Dale, which contained many waterfalls and a long, oval lake that reflected stars even in daylight. Perceiving [[Durin's Crown|these stars]] as a crown glittering above his head, Durin took this as an auspicious sign, named the lake ''Kheled-z\u00e2ram'', the Mirrormere, and chose the eastward-facing caves above it for his new stronghold.<ref name=\"Lothl\u00f3rien\" group=T>{{harvnb|The Fellowship of the Ring|2002|loc=book 2, ch. 6 \"Lothl\u00f3rien\"}}</ref>\n\n====Geology====\n\nThe [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]] excavated most of Khazad-d\u00fbm out of solid rock, leaving polished walls.<ref name=\"A Journey in the Dark\" group=T/> Minerals included [[gold]], [[gem]]s and [[iron ore]]. However the principal mineral was ''[[mithril]]'', a fabulously precious and versatile metal found nowhere else in Middle-earth. It was the source of Khazad-d\u00fbm's huge wealth, but ultimately [[#The Mines|its mining]] was the cause of its downfall. Beginning under the Silvertine, the Dwarves mined ever deeper, and down towards the roots of Mount Caradhras. There they unearthed the Balrog, which drove the Dwarves into exile.<ref name=\"A Journey in the Dark\" group=T/>\n\nFar below even the deepest mines of the Dwarves lay a primordial underworld of tunnels, [[Subterranean river|streams]] and [[Underground lake|lakes]] in perpetual darkness, inhabited by primitive creatures. The tunnels were \"gnawed by nameless things\" from the beginnings of [[Arda (Middle-earth)|Arda]],<ref name=\"The White Rider\" group=T/> along with the [[Watcher in the Water]], which [[Gandalf]] suggested may have come from the underworld's waters.<ref name=\"A Journey in the Dark\" group=T/>\n\n===History===\nMoria was founded by [[Durin]] at the end of the [[Cosmology of Tolkien's legendarium#Stars|Ages of the Stars]]. During his reign, the precious metal mithril was discovered in the mines, and some of the major structures of Moria were built: Durin's Bridge, the Second Hall, the Endless Stair and Durin's Tower. Durin died before the end of the First Age.

There were at least six levels above the [[#East-gate|Great Gates]], and many more levels \u2014or Deeps\u2014 below it. Every level consisted of a network of arched passages, chambers and many-pillared halls, often with \"black walls, polished and smooth as glass\".<ref name=\"A Journey in the Dark\" group=T/> Below the level of the Gates lay treasuries, armouries, dungeons, and mines.

Dr. Miniente is a sympathizer of the antifascist militants, Juan is more interested in Ramona, who is eighteen and shamelessly flirts with him. Once the dinner is over Juan is ready to leave but he is unable to start his rental car. Dr. Miniante invites him to spend the night at his house. Encouraged by Ramona's signals, Juan accepts. However once at bed he is unable to fall asleep thinking about Ramona and heads for her bedroom. She is not surprised to see him and he takes her initial favorable response as an invitation to go further. He rapes her. Since Ramona's mother is sound sleep and her father is by then drunk nobody hear her cries for help.\n\nJuan, who believes he has killed the girl, is frightened out of the house and tries to leave when he is surprised by his host, who knows nothing about what happened, and drunk as he is wants to go with him to a nearby brothel. Juan is unable to resist Dr. Miniente's insistence once he is inside the car and reluctantly agrees to give him a ride to a brothel. At one point they are stopped and interrogated by civil guards but are allowed to go their way. Dr. Miniente insists that he wants to party even though the sun is already risen. A heavy argument between the two men ends with the desperate Juan brutally hitting his heavily drunk friend. Juan leads the car to the side of a bridge, places his friend at the steering wheel and makes the car fall into the river. \n \nBy early morning, Juan returns to his mother's house hitchhiking. His sister Cristina, a secret member of the illicit Communist party, is following the news of the military trial against the members of ETA. Ramona looks for Juan. He apologizes but she does not regret what happened.  She says she was not hurt and feels she is in love with him. Meanwhile, Ramona's mother has been frantically looking for her husband. At the same time, a police inspector, who does not believe that the doctor's death was an accident begins to investigate. Juan is heavily interrogated as the prime suspect and is almost forced to confess, but he is saved by Ramona who provides him with an alibi.

Meanwhile, strange and macabre things are happening to the locals (and their pets) and it is revealed that four escaped mental patients- Mr. Smith, Mr. Trubshaw, Mr. Muldoon and Mr. Jones - who have been dosed with LSD as part of their treatment, are roaming the area, convinced they are living a shared dream in which they are free to rape and murder - both of which they choose to do numerous times before the belated arrival of the police.\n\n==Cast==\n*Anthony Forrest - Pete \n*Tom Marshall - Mike \n*[[Jane Hayden]] - Julie \n*Alison Elliott - Sandy \n*Georgina Kean - Agatha \n*[[JoAnne Good]] - Mary\n*Nigel Gregory - Mr. Smith \n*[[David Jackson (British actor)|David Jackson]] - Mr. Trubshaw \n*Paul Rattee - Mr. Muldoon \n*Peter Spraggon  - Mr. Jones \n*Jayne Lester - Elizabeth \n*[[Lisa Vanderpump]] - Anne \n*Debbie Martyn - Deirdre \n*Christine Winter - Carol (credited as Christina Jones) \n*Lynne Morgan - Sue  \n*Jean Reeve - Mrs. Hargreaves \n*[[Elizabeth Counsell]] - Miss Lilac \n*[[Hilda Braid]] - Mrs. May \n*[[Chubby Oates]] - Bus Driver \n*James Kerry - Psychiatrist\n*[[Hugh Ross (actor)|Hugh Ross]] - Government Minister\n\n==Background and history==\nDuring the mid-to-late 1970s, maverick directors such as [[Pete Walker]] and [[Norman J. Warren]] were trying to spice up the much-derided genre of British horror films.  These films would later be dubbed \"New Wave\" British horror, on account that they pushed the boundaries of taste as much as was possible within the British Board of Film Classification's strict regime and were set in modern-day 1970s Britain and centered on 20-30 aged protagonists, differing them from the predominantly period piece horrors of Hammer Films Productions that had gone before.  Alan Birkinshaw had begun his career in commercials, moving on to directing and producing Confessions of a Sex Maniac in 1974, and viewed making horror films as a natural progression. \"we decided that the horror film (genre) was more up market than a sex comedy\" he told ''Creeping Flesh'' in 2003.  Birkinshaw's film has been cited as combinings elements of Kubrick's ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'', the notorious American sleaze epic ''[[Carnal Madness]]'' (which was released in Britain as ''The Sizzlers''), and a low-rent, late-period ''[[Carry On (film series)|Carry On]]'' film.  However, by adding (faked) animal cruelty and the flippant treatment of rape, Birkinshaw created what was described in Matthew Sweet's book ''Shepperton Babylon'' as the most tasteless movie in British cinema history.\n\n''Killer's Moon'' was shot off season at [[Armathwaite Hall]] in the Lake District.  The eclectic  cast includes [[David Jackson (British actor)|David Jackson]], Jane Hayden (sister of cult actress [[Linda Hayden]]), [[JoAnne Good]], future restaurateur [[Lisa Vanderpump]], [[Hilda Braid]], comedian [[Chubby Oates]], and Hannah the three legged dog. Hannah the three legged dog in the film, was originally a pub dog who had lost a leg as the result of a shotgun wound sustained during an armed robbery.  She was later awarded the doggy [[Victoria Cross]] award for bravery.\n\nThe film was released in the Autumn of 1978 with the Charlton Heston/James Coburn film ''[[The Last Hard Men (film)|The Last Hard Men]]'' as a support feature, ''Killer's Moon'' also played in some cinemas as a supporting feature to the 1977 William Devane film ''[[Rolling Thunder (film)|Rolling Thunder]]''.\n\n==Revival==\nIn the late 1990s, ''Killer's Moon'' began to receive write-ups in magazines like ''Flesh and Blood'' and ''Nekrofile: Cinema of the Extreme''.\n\n''Killer's Moon'' received a rare UK cinema screening in 2001 as part of the 'Ten Years of Terror' one-day film convention held at the Riverside Studios in Hammersmith, London.  The convention was a tie-in event for the publication of the book ''Ten Years of Terror: British Horror Films of the 1970s'', which reprinted the Flesh and Blood review (\"a film that flouts good taste and decency with crude bravado, remaining perversely entertaining\".)\n\n''Creeping Flesh'', a book format look at horror and fantasy films published by [[Headpress]] in 2003 carried a lengthy article on the film (\u2018Hungry in a Dream\u2019) followed by an interview with Alan Birkinshaw.  ''Creeping Flesh'' was originally going to be titled ''Three Legged Dog'', in honor of \"Hannah, the pooch in ''Killer\u2019s Moon''\", but the title was later changed because it was felt that the reference was too obscure. A motif of a three-legged dog, however, appears at the beginning of each chapter.\n\n== DVD release ==\nIn 2008, [[Redemption Films]] released ''Killer's Moon'' on DVD in both the US and UK.
