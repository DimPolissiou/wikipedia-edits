Upon graduation, most DSMA cadets are commissioned with the rank of [[Lieutenant]] in the [[Myanmar Army Medical Corps]]. The military physicians are to serve the healthcare needs of rural people when they are assigned in the country's remote regions where access to healthcare is poor.\n\n==History==\n\nThe DSMA was founded in 1992 as the Defence Services Institute of Medicine (DSIM) to develop physicians to serve in the [[Tatmadaw]] [[Myanmar Armed Forces]]. Prior to the founding of the academy, the Tatmadaw had recruited its medical and dental officers from civilian medical school graduates, who had to undergo a month-long basic military training program at the Medical Corps Center. While the medical corps of the Tatmadaw had always been short of physicians, by the early 1990s, the shortage became more pronounced as the [[State Peace and Development Council|military government]], fearing student unrest, had shut down most civilian universities, following the [[8888 Uprising]] in 1988. Most civilian universities were closed off and on for much of the 1990s.<ref name=kyodo>{{cite news | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0WDP/is_/ai_63803917 | title=Myanmar university classes resume for 1st time in 3 years | date=2000-07-31 | publisher=Kyodo News International}}</ref> The military run universities essentially became the only venue for those who wished to continue university education inside the country.\n\nThe DSIM was operated by the [[Ministry of Health (Burma)|Ministry of Health]] and the [[Directorate of Medical Services]]. The purported \"aim of the DSMA is to produce good Medical officers endowed with brilliant physical and mental ability to safeguard The Three Main National Causes\" espoused by the military government.\n\nThe first batch of 47 cadets from the DSIM were commissioned as lieutenants on 17 December 1999, after six years of study and a year as house-surgeons. Through nine intakes, the DSMA produced a total of 1525 medical officers. As of 2008, the DSMA had produced seven Doctor of Medical Science degree holders. The academy is only source of medical officers for the DMS. In terms of Master of Medical Science, by the early 2008, the DSMA had produced 335 specialists, including 48 physicians and 41 surgeons.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}\n\nNowadays, many army doctors' clinics can be seen in Yangon and specialists of army hospital are also practicing at many private hospitals and clinics. Army doctors are serving the country both in rural and urban regions in the form of private and public practice.\n\n==Admissions==\nThe academy accepts approximately 400 students annually. Unlike at the country's other four civilian medical schools, the selection process goes beyond high [[University Entrance Examination]] scores. All prospective candidates must be male and must have high enough college matriculation exam scores to enter any civilian medical university. In addition, the prospective student must sit for another entrance exam as well as physical and psychological exams.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} After 2010, the matriculation examination marks are not considered for entrance. Personal interview becomes the most important step for entrance. The academy has accepted fewer than 100 students a year since 2010, and only 40 students are accepted to DSMA in 2012.\n\nThe selection criteria are:\n* Males only\n* DSMA entrance exams on 1. [[Biology]], [[Botany]] and [[Zoology]] and 2. [[English language|English]]\n* Physical fitness\n* Teamwork and comradeship screening\n* Psychometric assessment\n* General interviews\n* Medical checkups\n\nThe entrance selection including physical fitness tests, teamwork and comradeship screening, psychometric assessments and general interviews process takes about five to seven days at Officer Testing Team (OTT). Only those who pass all the tests and steps above are admitted to the DSMA. Students are eligible for state scholarship programs.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}\n\nThe benefit of being a student at DSMA is to get a stipend after acceptance to the school and faster career development than  civilian medical doctors. The salary is higher than civilian doctors.\n\n==Programs==\n\nThe DSMA offers courses for both basic and advanced degrees in medicine and surgery, and runs 20 graduate programs in medical sciences.<ref name=\"moh\">{{cite web | title=Health Statistics | url=http://www.moh.gov.mm/file/Health%20Statistics.pdf | accessdate=2008-11-29 | publisher=Ministry of Health, Myanmar | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081108035911/http://www.moh.gov.mm/file/Health%20Statistics.pdf | archivedate=2008-11-08 }}</ref>\n\n* [[Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery]] (M.B., B.S.)\n*[[Diploma|Diploma in Medical Science]] (Dip.Med.Sc.)\n* Master of Medical Science (M.Med.Sc.); Physiology, Anatomy, Biochemistry, Microbiology, Pharmacology, Pathology, Public Health, Forensic Medicine,  Internal Medicine, Surgery, Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Pediatrics, Orthopedics, Anaesthesiology, Radiology, Otorhinolaryngology, Ophthalmology, Mental Health, Rehabilitation medicine, Radiation oncology.\n* Doctor of Medical Science (Dr.Med.Sc.); Medicine, Surgery, Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Pediatrics, Orthopedics, Cardiac surgery, Cardiology, Neurology, Neurosurgery, Radiology, Anaesthesiology.

One of the most selective universities in the country, the academy offers [[Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery|M.B., B.S.]] (equivalent of the [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]]) degree programs. Upon graduation, most DSMA cadets are commissioned with the rank of [[Lieutenant]] in the [[Myanmar Army Medical Corps]]. The military physicians are to serve the healthcare needs of rural people when they are assigned in the country's remote regions where access to healthcare is poor.\n\n==History==\n\nThe DSMA was founded in 1992 as the Defence Services Institute of Medicine (DSIM) to develop physicians to serve in the [[Tatmadaw]] [[Myanmar Armed Forces]]. Prior to the founding of the academy, the Tatmadaw had recruited its medical and dental officers from civilian medical school graduates, who had to undergo a month-long basic military training program at the Medical Corps Center. While the medical corps of the Tatmadaw had always been short of physicians, by the early 1990s, the shortage became more pronounced as the [[State Peace and Development Council|military government]], fearing student unrest, had shut down most civilian universities, following the [[8888 Uprising]] in 1988. Most civilian universities were closed off and on for much of the 1990s.<ref name=kyodo>{{cite news | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0WDP/is_/ai_63803917 | title=Myanmar university classes resume for 1st time in 3 years | date=2000-07-31 | publisher=Kyodo News International}}</ref> The military run universities essentially became the only venue for those who wished to continue university education inside the country.\n\nThe DSIM was operated by the [[Ministry of Health (Burma)|Ministry of Health]] and the [[Directorate of Medical Services]]. The purported \"aim of the DSMA is to produce good Medical officers endowed with brilliant physical and mental ability to safeguard The Three Main National Causes\" espoused by the military government.\n\nThe first batch of 47 cadets from the DSIM were commissioned as lieutenants on 17 December 1999, after six years of study and a year as house-surgeons. Through nine intakes, the DSMA produced a total of 1525 medical officers. As of 2008, the DSMA had produced seven Doctor of Medical Science degree holders. The academy is only source of medical officers for the DMS. In terms of Master of Medical Science, by the early 2008, the DSMA had produced 335 specialists, including 48 physicians and 41 surgeons.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}\n\nNowadays, many army doctors' clinics can be seen in Yangon and specialists of army hospital are also practicing at many private hospitals and clinics.

''Weasel coffee'' is a loose English translation of its [[Vietnam]]ese name ''c\u00e0 ph\u00ea Ch\u1ed3n''.\n\nProducers of the coffee beans argue that the process may improve coffee through two mechanisms, selection \u2013 civets choosing to eat only certain cherries \u2013 and digestion \u2013 biological or chemical mechanisms in the animal's digestive tract altering the composition of the coffee cherries.\n\nThe traditional method of collecting feces from wild Asian palm civets has given way to an [[intensive farming]] method, in which the palm civets are kept in [[battery cage]]s and are force-fed the cherries.

They fight to stay together but they are separated and have to bear a very poor diet in very small cages. There is a high mortality rate and for some species of civet, there's a real conservation risk. It is spiralling out of control. But there's not much public awareness of how it is actually made.

The [[Ministry of Defence (Burma)|Ministry of Defence]] administered academy offers bachelor's degree programs in [[liberal arts]], combined physical [[sciences]], and [[computer science]]. The academy is open only to male applicants.\n\nThe DSA graduates are commissioned in one of the three branches of Myanmar military.\n\n==History==\nThe DSA was established in Fort Ba Htoo in southern [[Shan State]] in 1954, and was moved to its current home, a former [[United Kingdom|British]] hill station of [[Pyin Oo Lwin]] (formerly, Maymyo) in June 1957.<ref name=mp>{{cite journal |url=http://www.myanmar.gov.mm/Perspective/persp2001/4-2001/val.htm |title=Valiant Sons of Myanmar |author=Kyi Kyi Hla |date=2001-04-01 |publisher=Myanmar Perspectives |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124061156/http://www.myanmar.gov.mm/Perspective/persp2001/4-2001/val.htm |archivedate=2010-11-24 }}</ref> The first commander of DSA was Col. [[Orders, decorations, and medals of Burma#Civil awards|Thiri Pyanchi]] Kyaw Soe.\n\n==Mission==\nThe purpose of the academy is to \"train a new generation of highly educated and well-rounded officers for Myanmar's armed forces who are capable of leading the nation\". The DSA emphasizes on the academic curriculum alongside the military training with the intention of developing individuals who are capable of running the entire nation. In contrast, the mission of Officer Training School is to train the future commanders who can lead the Armed Forces in times of war. Furthermore, the OTS does not offer any additional academic qualifications, and the admission is usually open only to degree-holders. From 1999 onwards, it is open only to non-commissioned officers and servicemen holding degrees who demonstrate extraordinary qualities to become officers. Training duration is nine months.\n\n==Admissions==\nAs the country's most prestigious military academy, the DSA receives many applications from high school graduates each year. Unlike at most other Burmese universities, the selection process goes beyond the [[University Entrance Examination]] matriculation marks, including physical fitness tests, teamwork and comradeship screening, psychometric assessments and general interviews. The academy is open only to male applicants.\n\n==Programs==\nThe DSA offers four-year bachelor's degree programs in liberal arts, combined physical [[sciences]] (with specializations in areas such as chemistry, physics, mathematics, geology) and [[computer science]]. The undergraduate degree programs used to take four years but from the 42nd intake onwards, the duration has been reduced to three years.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The DSA comprises two main branches: the academic wing and the training wing.\n\n===Departments===\n\n# Department of English\n# Department of Mathematics\n# Department of Chemistry\n# Department of Physics\n# Department of Electronics\n# Department of Computer\n\n===Military education===\nAll cadets receive mandatory military training. The structure of the DSA is based on British and American (i.e. [[Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst|Sandhurst]] and [[West Point]] respectively) military training traditions as well as home-grown practices.\n\nIn the tradition of American system, the senior cadet officers are assigned to mentor junior cadet officers, overseeing day-to-day training, discipline and welfare of the juniors in general, with the aim of developing the so-called \"guardian brotherhood\" so as to develop a sense of community, comradeship, faith and trust, [[command hierarchy|chain of command]] and looking after one another. This function is supervised by an officer (known as company officer), usually at the rank of Captain, who is then supported by a senior non-commissioned officer, usually at the rank of Master Sergeant. The sergeant more closely interact with the cadet officers and is directly in the chain-of-command, and is similar to the British system.\n\nUnlike in American and British systems, which maintain separate military academies for different branches of armed forces, the DSA trains for all three branches of Burmese military (army, navy and air force). Its cadets select the branch to enter upon their graduation, subject to fulfilling further health and training requirements.\n\nIn general, cadets at the DSA starts their day in the early mornings with rigorous physical training, followed by academic lectures, then by military training. After the exams, they also spend a period devoted solely for military training which take place at various locations across the country. As part of their study requirements, they are taught political science, general law, international relations and other related subjects alongside their main studies regardless of specialism. In common with other universities in the country, the cadets are required to study Burmese, English and mathematics regardless of the subject they major in.\n\nThe first few weeks of the 1st year is known as \"soldier indoctrination week\" when newly recruited cadet officers are trained to have military mentality. Further more, cadet officers are not allowed to keep in touch with the outside world, not even with family (unless under exceptional circumstances such as death of a family member), for the first six months of the first year which is a period meant to transform these young high school graduates from civilians into potential military officers. Cadets are subject to further disciplinary requirements such as having to refrain from visiting the restricted areas of the city and the dress-code both while on DSA grounds and while in the city, even during their private time.\n\nThe board and room, uniform and food, as well as other essential supplies, for the cadet officers and their tuition costs are borne by the academy. In addition, they also receive a small amount of monthly allowance. In the past, up to 18th Intake, the academy allowed so-called private cadets who are well-qualified, and satisfied by admission board, but do not want military service obligation upon graduation. Such applicants pay tuition fees to the academy and fund their own cost of living while receiving education and training at the academy in exactly as the same way as the other regular cadet officers. Such private cadets are not obliged to serve in the Armed Forces upon graduation. However, they may choose to serve, at their own discretion, in the Armed Forces.

The [[Ministry of Defence (Burma)|Ministry of Defence]] administered academy offers bachelor's degree programs in [[liberal arts]], combined physical [[sciences]], and [[computer science]]. The academy is open only to male applicants.\n\nThe DSA graduates are commissioned in one of the three branches of Myanmar military.\n\n==History==\nThe DSA was established in Fort Ba Htoo in southern [[Shan State]] in 1954, and was moved to its current home, a former [[United Kingdom|British]] hill station of [[Pyin Oo Lwin]] (formerly, Maymyo) in June 1957.<ref name=mp>{{cite journal |url=http://www.myanmar.gov.mm/Perspective/persp2001/4-2001/val.htm |title=Valiant Sons of Myanmar |author=Kyi Kyi Hla |date=2001-04-01 |publisher=Myanmar Perspectives |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124061156/http://www.myanmar.gov.mm/Perspective/persp2001/4-2001/val.htm |archivedate=2010-11-24 }}</ref> The first commander of DSA was Col. [[Orders, decorations, and medals of Burma#Civil awards|Thiri Pyanchi]] Kyaw Soe.\n\n==Mission==\nThe purpose of the academy is to \"train a new generation of highly educated and well-rounded officers for Myanmar's armed forces who are capable of leading the nation\". The DSA emphasizes on the academic curriculum alongside the military training with the intention of developing individuals who are capable of running the entire nation. In contrast, the mission of Officer Training School is to train the future commanders who can lead the Armed Forces in times of war. Furthermore, the OTS does not offer any additional academic qualifications, and the admission is usually open only to degree-holders. From 1999 onwards, it is open only to non-commissioned officers and servicemen holding degrees who demonstrate extraordinary qualities to become officers. Training duration is nine months. \n\n==Admissions==\nAs the country's most prestigious military academy, the DSA receives many applications from high school graduates each year. Unlike at most other Burmese universities, the selection process goes beyond the [[University Entrance Examination]] matriculation marks, including physical fitness tests, teamwork and comradeship screening, psychometric assessments and general interviews. The academy is open only to male applicants.\n\n==Programs==\nThe DSA offers four-year bachelor's degree programs in liberal arts, combined physical [[sciences]] (with specializations in areas such as chemistry, physics, mathematics, geology) and [[computer science]]. The undergraduate degree programs used to take four years but from the 42nd intake onwards, the duration has been reduced to three years.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The DSA comprises two main branches: the academic wing and the training wing.\n\n===Departments===\n\n# Department of English\n# Department of Mathematics\n# Department of Chemistry\n# Department of Physics\n# Department of Electronics\n# Department of Computer\n\n===Military education===\nAll cadets receive mandatory military training. The structure of the DSA is based on British and American (i.e. [[Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst|Sandhurst]] and [[West Point]] respectively) military training traditions as well as home-grown practices.\n\nIn the tradition of American system, the senior cadet officers are assigned to mentor junior cadet officers, overseeing day-to-day training, discipline and welfare of the juniors in general, with the aim of developing the so-called \"guardian brotherhood\" so as to develop a sense of community, comradeship, faith and trust, [[command hierarchy|chain of command]] and looking after one another. This function is supervised by an officer (known as company officer), usually at the rank of Captain, who is then supported by a senior non-commissioned officer, usually at the rank of Master Sergeant. The sergeant more closely interact with the cadet officers and is directly in the chain-of-command, and is similar to the British system.\n\nUnlike in American and British systems, which maintain separate military academies for different branches of armed forces, the DSA trains for all three branches of Burmese military (army, navy and air force). Its cadets select the branch to enter upon their graduation, subject to fulfilling further health and training requirements.\n\nIn general, cadets at the DSA starts their day in the early mornings with rigorous physical training, followed by academic lectures, then by military training. After the exams, they also spend a period devoted solely for military training which take place at various locations across the country. As part of their study requirements, they are taught political science, general law, international relations and other related subjects alongside their main studies regardless of specialism. In common with other universities in the country, the cadets are required to study Burmese, English and mathematics regardless of the subject they major in.\n\nThe first few weeks of the 1st year is known as \"soldier indoctrination week\" when newly recruited cadet officers are trained to have military mentality. Further more, cadet officers are not allowed to keep in touch with the outside world, not even with family (unless under exceptional circumstances such as death of a family member), for the first six months of the first year which is a period meant to transform these young high school graduates from civilians into potential military officers. Cadets are subject to further disciplinary requirements such as having to refrain from visiting the restricted areas of the city and the dress-code both while on DSA grounds and while in the city, even during their private time.\n\nThe board and room, uniform and food, as well as other essential supplies, for the cadet officers and their tuition costs are borne by the academy. In addition, they also receive a small amount of monthly allowance. In the past, up to 18th Intake, the academy allowed so-called private cadets who are well-qualified, and satisfied by admission board, but do not want military service obligation upon graduation. Such applicants pay tuition fees to the academy and fund their own cost of living while receiving education and training at the academy in exactly as the same way as the other regular cadet officers. Such private cadets are not obliged to serve in the Armed Forces upon graduation. However, they may choose to serve, at their own discretion, in the Armed Forces. Private cadets made up about 5~10% of each intakes. Private cadets are, however, no longer admitted after 18th Intake. The minimum contract of the military service for the regular cadet officers upon graduation is 10 years.\n\n==Facilities==\n* Planetarium (one of two planetariums in Myanmar)\n* Library\n* Computer laboratory for parallel and distributed computing\n* Computer clusters\n* Computer-assisted foreign language facilities\n* Telescope facilities\n* Chemistry and geology teaching laboratory\n* Radiation physics research laboratory\n* Electronics laboratory with clean room facilities\n* Olympic-size swimming pool\n* Several large sports fields with football grounds and tennis courts\n* Gymnasiums\n\n==Principals==\n*Colonel [[Orders, decorations, and medals of Burma#Civil awards|Thiri Pyanchi]] Kyaw Soe (August 1, 1954-March 3, 1957)\n*Colonel Thiri Pyanchi Than Sein (March 8, 1957-May 26, 1957)\n*Colonel Thiri Pyanchi L Khun Naung (October 9, 1957-October 31, 1968)\n*Colonel [[Orders, decorations, and medals of Burma#Civil awards|Zaya Kyawhtin]] Htun Aung Kyaw (November 1, 1968-May 28, 1972)\n*Colonel Kyaw Nyein (May 29, 1972-July 31, 1975)\n*Colonel Khin Maung Tint (August 1, 1975-June 30, 1977)\n*Colonel Aye Ko (July 1, 1977-October 30, 1979)\n*Colonel Aung Win (October 4, 1979-August 19, 1981)\n*Colonel Sein Ya (August 20, 1981-May 22, 1982)\n*Colonel Thein Saing (May 23, 1982-October 10, 1985)\n*Colonel Aung Naing (October 18, 1986-August 5, 1992)\n*Brigadier General Soe Win Maung (August 6, 1992-December 10, 1997)\n*Colonel Tin Win (December 11, 1997-January 4, 1999)\n*Brigadier General Moe Hein (January 5, 1999-August 27, 1999)\n*Brigadier General Tin Oo (August 28, 1999-May 14, 2001)\n*Brigadier General Ye Myint (July 7, 2001-December 22, 2001)\n*Brigadier General Khin Zaw (December 23, 2001-May 19, 2002)\n*Brigadier General Ohn Myint (July 27, 2002-August 30, 2003)\n*Brigadier General [[Orders, decorations, and medals of Burma#Civil awards|Tharaysithu]] [[Min Aung Hlaing]] (August 31, 2004-November 6, 2004)\n*Brigadier General Nyi Tun (May 5, 2005-May 27, 2006)\n*Brigadier General Kyaw Swe (August 11, 2006-November 27, 2007)\n*Brigadier General [[Orders, decorations, and medals of Burma#Civil awards|Thiri Pyanchi]] Zeyar Aung (November 12, 2007-August 31, 2010)\n*Brigadier General Mya Htun Oo (August 31, 2010-December 26, 2010)\n*Brigadier General Nyo Saw (May 7, 2011-October 1, 2011)\n*Major General Aung Lin Dwe (October 1, 2011-January 17, 2014)\n*Major General Myint Maw (January 19-2014- January 6, 2017)\n*Major General Thaung Htike Shwe (January 7, 2017- 2018)\n\n==Alumni==\n{{details|Category:Defence Services Academy alumni}}\n* Vice-Senior General [[Maung Aye]], army chief and Vice Chairman of the [[State Peace and Development Council|SPDC]], State Peace and Development Council of [[Myanmar]] - DSA 1st intake\n* [[Colonel]] [[U Thaung]], Minister of Science and Technology - Awarded Best Cadet in DSA 1st intake.\n* [[Lieutenant General]][[Tin Hla]], [[Deputy Prime Minister]], Minister of Military Affairs and Founder of MEC -DSA 3rd Intake\n*General [[Thein Sein]], [[President of Burma|President]] - DSA 9th intake\n*Lieutenant-General [[Tin Aye]], Chairman, [[Union Electoral Commission]] - DSA 9th intake\n* [[General]] Thura [[Shwe Mann]], Speaker of the Pyithu Hluttaw - DSA 11th intake\n*General Thiha Thura [[Tin Aung Myint Oo]], Vice President of Burma - DSA 12th intake\n* Brigadier-General [[Hla Myint (Brigadier General)|Hla Myint]], 13th intake<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.mizzima.com/news/inside-burma/4987-retired-ambassador-hla-myint-likely-to-replace-rangoon-mayor.html | title=Retired ambassador Hla Myint likely to replace Rangoon Mayor | work=Mizzima News | date=2011-03-09 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501002409/http://www.mizzima.com/news/inside-burma/4987-retired-ambassador-hla-myint-likely-to-replace-rangoon-mayor.html | archivedate=2011-05-01 }}</ref>\n* [[Lieutenant General]] [[Myint Swe (general)|Myint Swe]], Chief of Bureau of Special Operation-5 - DSA 15th intake\n*Lieutenant-General Ye' Myint, Directorate of Military Affairs Security - DSA 15th intake\n*Lieutenant-General [[Tha Aye]], Chief of Bureau of Special Operation - 4  - DSA 16th intake\n*Col.
