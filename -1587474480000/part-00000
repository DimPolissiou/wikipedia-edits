It was hosted between 30 May to 14 July across eleven venues in [[England]] and [[Wales]] with the tournament being the fifth time that England had hosted the World Cup while for Wales it was their third.\n\nThe tournament was contested by 10 teams, a decrease from 14 teams the previous edition with the format of the tournament changing to a single round-robin group with the top four teams qualifying through to the knockout stage. After six weeks of round-robin matches, which saw four games not have a [[Result (cricket)#No result|result]], [[India national cricket team|India]], [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]], [[England cricket team|England]] and [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]] finished as the top four with [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]] missing out by [[net run rate]].\n\nIn the knockout stage, England and New Zealand won their respective semi-finals to qualify for the [[2019 Cricket World Cup Final|final]], which was played at [[Lord's]] in London. The final ended in a [[Result (cricket)#Tie|tie]] after the match ended with both teams scoring 241 [[run (cricket)|runs]], followed by the first [[Super Over]] in an ODI; England won the title, their first, on the boundary countback rule after the Super Over also finished level.

With the loss of their top order, England fell to 86/4 in the 24th over, however, a century partnership between Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler for the fifth wicket got them back into the game before Buttler was caught on 59. However, with five overs to play, England still required another 46 runs, and the bottom order were forced to bat more aggressively. Stokes managed to farm the strike and, more crucially, score runs, leaving England needing 15 to win from the final over, two wickets still in hand. After two [[Glossary of cricket terms#D|dot balls]], Stokes first planted a six into the stands at deep mid-wicket; on the next ball, the fielder's throw deflected off Stokes' bat as he was coming back for a second run and went to the boundary for an additional four; umpire Kumar Dharmasena awarded six runs for that delivery, despite the ''[[Laws of Cricket]]'' saying only one of the batsmen's runs should have counted towards the total as they had not crossed during the attempted second run at the moment the fielder threw the ball in.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/48991962|title=England Cricket World Cup win: 'Extra run' claims brushed off by Ashley Giles|work=BBC Sport|date=15 July 2019|access-date=4 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190721111216/https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/48991962|archive-date=21 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The final two deliveries of the over saw England get a run each, but losing their last two wickets going for a second run each time, leaving the scores tied at 241 with Stokes left unbeaten with 84.<ref>{{cite news|first=Vic|last=Marks|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/14/england-new-zealand-cricket-world-cup-final-match-report-super-over|title=England win Cricket World Cup after super-over drama against New Zealand|newspaper=The Guardian|date=14 July 2019|access-date=17 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190716093839/https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/14/england-new-zealand-cricket-world-cup-final-match-report-super-over|archive-date=16 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nWith the scores tied, the match went to a [[Super Over]]. England returned Stokes and Buttler to the crease, and they handled Trent Boult's bowling to accumulate 15 runs without loss. For New Zealand, Martin Guptill and James Neesham went in to face Jofra Archer needing at least 16 runs to claim the title. After a steady accumulation of runs, including a wide and a six, left New Zealand needing two from the final delivery, Guptill hit the ball out to deep mid-wicket and tried to scamper back for the winning run, but Roy's throw in to Buttler was a good one with Guptill being well short of his crease. New Zealand finished with 15 runs to tie the Super Over, but England's superior boundary count in the match and Super Over combined (26 to New Zealand's 17) meant they claimed the World Cup title for the first time after three previous final defeats in [[1979 Cricket World Cup|1979]], [[1987 Cricket World Cup|1987]] and 1992.<ref>{{cite web|first=Alan|last=Gardner|url=https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/8039/report/1144530/england-vs-new-zealand-final-icc-cricket-world-cup-2019|title=Epic final tied, Super Over tied, England win World Cup on boundary count|work=ESPNcricinfo|date=14 July 2019|access-date=17 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190715190820/https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/8039/report/1144530/england-vs-new-zealand-final-icc-cricket-world-cup-2019|archive-date=15 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Ben Stokes was named man of the match; referring to the controversial overthrows that deflected off his bat, he said he would be \"apologising to [New Zealand captain Kane Williamson] for the rest of [his] life\", and later said England's first World Cup victory was \"written in the stars\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thedailystar.net/icc-cricket-world-cup-2019/will-apologise-kane-williamson-rest-my-life-ben-stokes-1771942|title=Will apologise to Kane for rest of my life: Stokes|newspaper=The Daily Star|date=16 July 2019|access-date=17 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190920221429/https://www.thedailystar.net/icc-cricket-world-cup-2019/will-apologise-kane-williamson-rest-my-life-ben-stokes-1771942|archive-date=20 September 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{{Single-innings cricket match\n| bg = #eee\n| date = {{anchor|match48}} 14 July 2019\n| team1 = {{cr-rt|NZ}}\n| team2 = {{cr|ENG}}\n| score1 = 241/8 (50 overs)\n| score2 = 241 (50 overs)\n| result = [[2019 Cricket World Cup knockout stage#Final|Match tied]]\n| report = [https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/8039/game/1144530/england-vs-new-zealand-final-icc-cricket-world-cup-2019/ Scorecard]\n| venue = [[Lord's]], London\n| notes = Super Over: England 15/0, New Zealand 15/1.\n*''England won the match on the boundary count back rule (26\u201317).''\n}}\n\n==Statistics==\n{{main|2019 Cricket World Cup statistics}}\nIndia's Virat Kohli ended the tournament as the leading run scorer with 824 runs from nine matches which featured a 174 against Pakistan at Old Trafford.<ref name=IndiavsPakistan/> He finished ahead of Australia's David Warner (647 runs) and Bangladesh's Shakib Al Hasan (606 runs).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/batting/most_runs_career.html?id=12357;type=tournament|title=Highest run scorers at the 2019 Cricket World Cup|work=ESPNcricinfo|access-date=8 February 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200208234420/http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/batting/most_runs_career.html?id=12357;type=tournament|archive-date=8 February 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> Australian bowler Mitchell Starc ended up as the leading wicket-taker with 27 wickets, which surpassed the record set by [[Glenn McGrath]] in [[2007 Cricket World Cup|2007]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-world-cup/mitchell-starc-breaks-glenn-mcgraths-record-for-most-wickets-in-a-world-cup/articleshow/70180202.cms|title=Mitchell Starc breaks Glenn McGrath's record for most wickets in a World Cup|newspaper=The Times of India|agency=AFP|date=11 July 2019|access-date=22 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190722185149/https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-world-cup/mitchell-starc-breaks-glenn-mcgraths-record-for-most-wickets-in-a-world-cup/articleshow/70180202.cms|archive-date=22 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Second was Lockie Ferguson from New Zealand with 21 wickets, while Mustafizur Rahman (Bangladesh) and Jofra Archer (England) were tied for third place with 20 wickets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/bowling/most_wickets_career.html?id=12357;type=tournament|title=Highest wicket takers at the 2019 Cricket World Cup|work=ESPNcricinfo|access-date=8 February 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200208234533/http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/bowling/most_wickets_career.html?id=12357;type=tournament|archive-date=8 February 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Most runs===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Runs\n!class=\"unsortable\"|Player\n!{{Abbr|Inns|Innings}}\n!{{Abbr|HS|High score}}\n!{{Abbr|Ave|Average}}\n!{{Abbr|SR|Strike rate}}\n!{{Abbr|100|Hundreds scored}}\n!{{Abbr|50|Fiftys scored}}\n!{{Abbr|4s|Fours hit}}\n!{{Abbr|6s|Sixes hit}}\n|-\n!

[[cricket]] tournament contested by men's national teams and organised by the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC). It was hosted between 30 May to 14 July across eleven venues in [[England]] and [[Wales]] with the tournament being the fifth time that England had hosted the World Cup while for Wales it was their third.\n\nThe tournament was contested by 10 teams, a decrease from 14 teams the previous edition with the format of the tournament changing to a single round-robin group with the top four teams qualifying through to the knockout stage. After six weeks of round-robin matches, which saw four games not have a [[Result (cricket)#No result|result]], [[India national cricket team|India]], [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]], [[England cricket team|England]] and [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]] finished as the top four with [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]] missing out by [[net run rate]].\n\nIn the knockout stage, England and New Zealand won their respective semi-finals to qualify for the [[2019 Cricket World Cup Final|final]], which was played at [[Lord's]] in London. The final ended in a [[Result (cricket)#Tie|tie]] after the match ended with both teams scoring 241 [[run (cricket)|runs]], followed by the first [[Super Over]] in an ODI; England won the title, their first, on the boundary countback rule after the Super Over also finished level. Overall, approximately 2.6&nbsp;billion people around the world watched the tournament, making it the most-watched cricket competition {{as of|2019|lc=y|post=.}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.icc-cricket.com/media-releases/1277987|title=ICC Men's Cricket World Cup 2019 shatters audience records|publisher=International Cricket Council|date=12 July 2019|access-date=17 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190715174152/https://www.icc-cricket.com/media-releases/1277987|archive-date=15 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Hosting==\nThe hosting rights were awarded in April 2006, after England and Wales withdrew their bid to host the [[2015 Cricket World Cup]], which was played in Australia and New Zealand.

[[Imad Wasim]] immediately hit 18 runs in the 46th over, and despite losing Shadab Khan to a run out in the 47th, Wasim and Wahab Riaz saw Pakistan home to a three-wicket victory with two balls to spare.<ref>{{cite news|first=Tanya|last=Aldred|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/29/pakistan-imad-wasim-afghanistan-thriller-cricket-world-cup|title=Pakistan's Imad Wasim holds nerve to see off Afghanistan in thriller|newspaper=The Guardian|date=30 June 2019|access-date=5 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190702140948/https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/29/pakistan-imad-wasim-afghanistan-thriller-cricket-world-cup|archive-date=2 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe return of opener Jason Roy from injury helped England escape their slump as they emerged victorious by 31 runs against the hitherto unbeaten India in a crucial must-win game for the hosts. An opening partnership between Roy (66) and [[Jonny Bairstow]] (111) was the key factor in the victory, while Stokes scored 79 runs off 54 balls for his third consecutive half-century, to help England reach 337/7. The score proved too much for India, despite [[Rohit Sharma]] and [[Virat Kohli]] scoring 102 and 66 respectively, while the returning England bowler [[Liam Plunkett]] took 3/55.<ref>{{cite web|first=Deivarayan|last=Muthu|url=https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/8039/report/1144520/england-vs-india-38th-match-icc-cricket-world-cup-2019|title=Jonny Bairstow and Ben Stokes help end India's unbeaten run|work=ESPNcricinfo|date=30 June 2019|access-date=7 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190701220741/https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/8039/report/1144520/england-vs-india-38th-match-icc-cricket-world-cup-2019|archive-date=1 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Sri Lanka won the dead rubber against the West Indies at [[Chester-le-Street]], where both [[Avishka Fernando]] and [[Nicholas Pooran]] scored their maiden ODI centuries.<ref>{{cite news|first=Tanya|last=Aldred|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/01/sri-lanka-west-indies-cricket-world-cup-match-report|title=Avishka Fernando hits high notes and Sri Lanka hold nerve against West Indies|newspaper=The Guardian|date=2 July 2019|access-date=7 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190704210528/https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/01/sri-lanka-west-indies-cricket-world-cup-match-report|archive-date=4 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Bangladesh's Shakib Al Hasan made history against India, as he became the first man to score 500 runs and take 10 wickets in a single World Cup.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/icc-cricket-world-cup/news/shakib-al-hasan-world-cup-2019-records-batting-bowling-allrounder-new-zealand-scott-styris/article28263851.ece|title=Shakib Al Hasan first to 500 runs and 10 wickets in single World Cup|work=[[Sportstar]]|date=2 July 2019|access-date=2 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190702174447/https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/icc-cricket-world-cup/news/shakib-al-hasan-world-cup-2019-records-batting-bowling-allrounder-new-zealand-scott-styris/article28263851.ece|archive-date=2 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> This performance was not enough, though, with a Rohit Sharma century leading India into the semi-finals at their opponents' expense.<ref name=IndiaQ>{{cite news|first=Tim|last=Wigmore|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cricket/2019/07/02/bangladesh-vs-india-cricket-world-cup-2019-live-score-latest/|title=India qualify for Cricket World Cup semi-finals after Rohit Sharma's ton against Bangladesh|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=2 July 2019|access-date=7 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190707040434/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cricket/2019/07/02/bangladesh-vs-india-cricket-world-cup-2019-live-score-latest/|archive-date=7 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====Week 6====\n[[File:Shakib_fielding,_23_January,_2009,_Dhaka_SBNS.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Shakib Al Hasan]] (pictured in 2009) became the only cricketer in the World Cup history with 600 runs and 10 wickets.<ref name=\"Hasan\">{{cite news|first=Saurabh|last=Kumar|title=Shakib Al Hasan breaks Sachin Tendulkar' World Cup record|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket-world-cup-2019/story/shakib-al-hasan-breaks-sachin-tendulkar-world-cup-record-1563193-2019-07-05|work=India Today|date=5 July 2019|access-date=6 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190706023527/https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket-world-cup-2019/story/shakib-al-hasan-breaks-sachin-tendulkar-world-cup-record-1563193-2019-07-05|archive-date=6 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>|alt=Shakib Al Hasan in 2009]]\nThe final round started with England taking on New Zealand, with the winner guaranteed a semi-final position.

However, with five overs to play, England still required another 46 runs, and the bottom order were forced to bat more aggressively. Stokes managed to farm the strike and, more crucially, score runs, leaving England needing 15 to win from the final over, two wickets still in hand. After two [[Glossary of cricket terms#D|dot balls]], Stokes first planted a six into the stands at deep mid-wicket; on the next ball, the fielder's throw deflected off Stokes' bat as he was coming back for a second run and went to the boundary for an additional four; umpire Kumar Dharmasena awarded six runs for that delivery, despite the ''[[Laws of Cricket]]'' saying only one of the batsmen's runs should have counted towards the total as they had not crossed during the attempted second run at the moment the fielder threw the ball in.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/48991962|title=England Cricket World Cup win: 'Extra run' claims brushed off by Ashley Giles|work=BBC Sport|date=15 July 2019|access-date=4 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190721111216/https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/48991962|archive-date=21 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The final two deliveries of the over saw England get a run each, but losing their last two wickets going for a second run each time, leaving the scores tied at 241 with Stokes left unbeaten with 84.<ref>{{cite news|first=Vic|last=Marks|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/14/england-new-zealand-cricket-world-cup-final-match-report-super-over|title=England win Cricket World Cup after super-over drama against New Zealand|newspaper=The Guardian|date=14 July 2019|access-date=17 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190716093839/https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/14/england-new-zealand-cricket-world-cup-final-match-report-super-over|archive-date=16 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nWith the scores tied, the match went to a [[Super Over]].

For New Zealand, Martin Guptill and James Neesham went in to face Jofra Archer needing at least 16 runs to claim the title. After a steady accumulation of runs, including a wide and a six, left New Zealand needing two from the final delivery, Guptill hit the ball out to deep mid-wicket and tried to scamper back for the winning run, but Roy's throw in to Buttler was a good one with Guptill being well short of his crease. New Zealand finished with 15 runs to tie the Super Over, but England's superior boundary count in the match and Super Over combined (26 to New Zealand's 17) meant they claimed the World Cup title for the first time after three previous final defeats in [[1979 Cricket World Cup|1979]], [[1987 Cricket World Cup|1987]] and 1992.<ref>{{cite web|first=Alan|last=Gardner|url=https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/8039/report/1144530/england-vs-new-zealand-final-icc-cricket-world-cup-2019|title=Epic final tied, Super Over tied, England win World Cup on boundary count|work=ESPNcricinfo|date=14 July 2019|access-date=17 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190715190820/https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/8039/report/1144530/england-vs-new-zealand-final-icc-cricket-world-cup-2019|archive-date=15 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Ben Stokes was named man of the match; referring to the controversial overthrows that deflected off his bat, he said he would be \"apologising to [New Zealand captain Kane Williamson] for the rest of [his] life\", and later said England's first World Cup victory was \"written in the stars\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thedailystar.net/icc-cricket-world-cup-2019/will-apologise-kane-williamson-rest-my-life-ben-stokes-1771942|title=Will apologise to Kane for rest of my life: Stokes|newspaper=The Daily Star|date=16 July 2019|access-date=17 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190920221429/https://www.thedailystar.net/icc-cricket-world-cup-2019/will-apologise-kane-williamson-rest-my-life-ben-stokes-1771942|archive-date=20 September 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{{Single-innings cricket match\n| bg = #eee\n| date = {{anchor|match48}} 14 July 2019\n| team1 = {{cr-rt|NZ}}\n| team2 = {{cr|ENG}}\n| score1 = 241/8 (50 overs)\n| score2 = 241 (50 overs)\n| result = [[2019 Cricket World Cup knockout stage#Final|Match tied]]\n| report = [https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/8039/game/1144530/england-vs-new-zealand-final-icc-cricket-world-cup-2019/ Scorecard]\n| venue = [[Lord's]], London\n| notes = Super Over: England 15/0, New Zealand 15/1.\n*''England won the match on the boundary count back rule (26\u201317).''\n}}\n\n==Statistics==\n{{main|2019 Cricket World Cup statistics}}\nIndia's Rohit Sharma ended the tournament as the leading run scorer with 648 runs from nine matches which featured a 140 against Pakistan at Old Trafford.<ref name=IndiavsPakistan/> He finished ahead of Australia's David Warner (647 runs) and Bangladesh's Shakib Al Hasan (606 runs).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/batting/most_runs_career.html?id=12357;type=tournament|title=Highest run scorers at the 2019 Cricket World Cup|work=ESPNcricinfo|access-date=8 February 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200208234420/http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/batting/most_runs_career.html?id=12357;type=tournament|archive-date=8 February 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> Australian bowler Mitchell Starc ended up as the leading wicket-taker with 27 wickets, which surpassed the record set by [[Glenn McGrath]] in [[2007 Cricket World Cup|2007]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-world-cup/mitchell-starc-breaks-glenn-mcgraths-record-for-most-wickets-in-a-world-cup/articleshow/70180202.cms|title=Mitchell Starc breaks Glenn McGrath's record for most wickets in a World Cup|newspaper=The Times of India|agency=AFP|date=11 July 2019|access-date=22 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190722185149/https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-world-cup/mitchell-starc-breaks-glenn-mcgraths-record-for-most-wickets-in-a-world-cup/articleshow/70180202.cms|archive-date=22 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Second was Lockie Ferguson from New Zealand with 21 wickets, while Mustafizur Rahman (Bangladesh) and Jofra Archer (England) were tied for third place with 20 wickets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/bowling/most_wickets_career.html?id=12357;type=tournament|title=Highest wicket takers at the 2019 Cricket World Cup|work=ESPNcricinfo|access-date=8 February 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200208234533/http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/bowling/most_wickets_career.html?id=12357;type=tournament|archive-date=8 February 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Most runs===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Runs\n!class=\"unsortable\"|Player\n!{{Abbr|Inns|Innings}}\n!{{Abbr|HS|High score}}\n!{{Abbr|Ave|Average}}\n!{{Abbr|SR|Strike rate}}\n!{{Abbr|100|Hundreds scored}}\n!{{Abbr|50|Fiftys scored}}\n!{{Abbr|4s|Fours hit}}\n!{{Abbr|6s|Sixes hit}}\n|-\n!

{"title_page": "Medicare (Australia)", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2019}}\n{{use Australian English|date=December 2019}}\n\n[[Image:Medicare brand.svg|thumb|The Medicare scheme logo]]\n\n'''Medicare''' is the publicly-funded [[universal health care]] insurance scheme in [[Australia]] (including its external territories) operated by [[Services Australia]] (formerly the Department of Human Services). Medicare is the main source of payment of [[health care in Australia]], either partially or fully covering the cost of most [[primary health care]] services for eligible citizens, residents and some visitors. Residents are entitled to a rebate for treatment by medical practitioners, eligible midwives, nurse practitioners and allied health professionals who have been issued a [[Medicare (Australia)#Medicare provider numbers|Medicare provider number]], and they can also obtain free treatment in state public hospitals. \n\nSome specialties and allied health services are at least partly covered by Medicare for certain patients with chronic illness. These services include [[ophthalmology]], [[physiotherapy]] and [[audiology]], but not most dental services.\n\nMedicare sets a schedule of fees, called the '''Medicare Benefits Schedule''' ('''MBS'''), formerly '''Commonwealth Medicare Benefits Schedule''' ('''CMBS'''); this schedule covers which services are covered, what the fee for that service is deemed to be, and the level (as a percentage) to which they are covered by Medicare rebates to the patient.\n\nThe scheme was created in 1975 by the [[Whitlam Government]] under the brand ''Medibank'', and was limited by the [[Fraser Government]] in 1976 to paying customers only. The [[Hawke Government]] reinstated universal health care in 1984 under the brand of ''Medicare''. [[Medibank]] continued to exist as a government-owned private health insurance provider until it was privatised by the [[Abbott Government]] in 2014.\n\n'''Reciprocal Health Care Agreements''' ('''RHCA''') are in place with the [[United Kingdom]], [[Sweden]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], [[Finland]], [[Norway]], [[Slovenia]], [[Malta]], [[Italy]], [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[New Zealand]], which entitles visitors from these countries limited access to public health care in Australia and eligible Australians to reciprocal rights while in one of these countries.\n\n==Constitutional framework==\nAustralia's Medicare scheme operates under power granted to the federal Parliament by [[s:Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act#Part V.--Powers of the Parliament.|Section 51 (xxiiiA) of the Commonwealth Constitution]], which was inserted by a [[Australian referendum, 1946 (Social Services)|referendum of 1946]], and gave the federal Parliament power, subject to the Constitution, to make laws with respect to: ''The provision of maternity allowances, widows' pensions, child endowment, unemployment, pharmaceutical, sickness and hospital benefits, medical and dental services (but not so as to authorise any form of civil conscription), benefits to students and family allowances.''\n\nThis empowers the Commonwealth to provide benefits under the Medicare scheme, but not to provide health care services directly. The operation of hospitals, for example, remains within the jurisdiction of the states and territories, and the Commonwealth must operate through their authority.\n\nPrivately run hospitals are also part of the Medicare scheme. Medicare benefits are payable for medical treatment provided to admitted patients of private hospitals as well as public hospitals. However, a patient in a private hospital (by definition, a private patient) would need private insurance coverage to help him or her meet any of the hospital charges such as accommodation costs, as well as some or all of the remainder of the doctor's charges above the 75% Medicare benefit.\n\n==History==\n\n===Health insurance prior to Medibank===\nThere was an increase in the number of [[Australians]] covered by health insurance plans following the end of the [[Second World War]]. However, a large proportion of the [[Australia]]n population continued to lack coverage for health risks in the early 1970s. In 1972, 17% of Australians outside of [[Queensland]] (which had a free public health care system<ref>Health Reform: Public Success, Private Failure by Daniel Drache and Terry Sullivan</ref>) were uninsured, most of whom were on low incomes.\n\n===Medibank (1975\u201376)===\nThe [[Whitlam government|Whitlam Labor government]], elected in 1972, sought to put an end to the two-tier system by extending healthcare coverage to the entire population.<ref>''Understanding the Australian Health Care System'' by Eileen Willis, Louise Reynolds, and Keleher Helen.</ref> Before the Labor Party came to office, [[Bill Hayden]], one of the Labor Party's front bench members of parliament, took the main responsibility for developing the preliminary plans to establish a universal health scheme.\n\nMedibank started on schedule on 1 July 1975.<ref name=\"medicbrief\">{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/library/intguide/SP/medicare.htm |title=Medicare \u2013 Background Brief |last=Biggs |first=Amanda |date=29 October 2004 |work=Parliament of Australia: Parliamentary Library |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia |accessdate=16 April 2010 |location=Canberra, ACT |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207065307/http://www.aph.gov.au/library/intguide/SP/medicare.htm |archivedate= 7 February 2012 }}</ref> In nine months, the [[Health Insurance Commission]] (HIC) had increased its staff from 22 to 3500, opened 81 offices, installed 31 minicomputers, 633 terminals and 10 medium-sized computers linked by land-lines to the central computer, and issued registered health insurance cards to 90% of the Australian population.\n\n===Medibank Mark II (1976\u201381)===\nAfter a change of government at the [[Australian federal election, 1975|December 1975 election]], the [[Fraser Government|Fraser Coalition government]] established the Medibank Review Committee in January 1976. This lead to legislative changes, and the launch of 'Medibank Mark II' on 1 October 1976.\n\nAlso that year, the Fraser government also passed the [[Medibank Private]] bill, which allowed the HIC to enter the private health insurance business. \n\nIn 1978, [[bulk billing]] was restricted to pensioners and the socially disadvantaged. Rebates were reduced to 75% of the schedule fee. The health insurance levy was also scrapped that year.\n\nIn 1979, Medibank rebates were cut further. In 1981, access to Medibank was restricted further, and an income tax rebate was introduced for holders of private health insurance to encourage its uptake.\n\nFinally, the original Medibank was dissolved entirely in late 1981, leaving behind Medibank Private.\n\n===Medicare (1984\u2013current)===\nOn 1 February 1984, the original Medibank model was reinstated by the [[Hawke Government|Hawke Labor government]], but renamed Medicare to distinguish it from Medibank Private which continued to exist.\n\n====Easyclaim and successors====\nEasyclaim was launched in 2006, under which a patient would pay the medical practitioner the consultation fee and the receptionist would send a message to Medicare to release the amount of rebate due to the patient's designated bank account. The rebate amount would take into account the patient's concession status and thresholds. In effect, the patient only pays the gap.<ref>https://www.humanservices.gov.au/organisations/health-professionals/services/medicare/medicare-easyclaim/about/what-you-need-know</ref> In recent years, this has largely been replaced with the [[National Australia Bank]] service HICAPS (Health Insurance Claim At Point of Sale)<ref>{{cite web |title=HICAPS |url=https://www.hicaps.com.au/ |website=www.hicaps.com.au |language=en}}</ref>. For providers not using HICAPS, patients can make claims on-the-spot (where Medicare will pay the patient at a later date), online, through the Medicare mobile apps, or at joint Medicare-Centrelink Service Centres.\n\nServices like these have greatly reduced the need for people to visit Medicare service centres, all of which have been merged into [[Centrelink]] or ''myGov'' shopfronts.\n\n====Better Access Scheme====\nThe [[Better Access Scheme]] extends Medicare to cover more [[allied health]] services than it did previously, especially in the area of [[mental health]]. It became available in November 2006.\n\n====National Disability Insurance Scheme====\nA long-standing criticism of the Medicare schedule was its limited coverage of services to improve the lives of people with disability. This was addressed when the [[2013 Australian federal budget]] (ALP) established the [[National Disability Insurance Scheme]], which was progressively rolled out across the country between 2013 and 2020. It provides funding for health services beyond those in the Medicare schedule, and is administered by the National Disability Insurance Agency, an independent government agency.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ndis.gov.au/about-us|title=About us|last=National Disability Insurance Agency|first=|date=|website=National Disability Insurance Scheme|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref>\n\n====MBS indexation freeze====\nIn the [[2013 Australian federal budget]] (Australian Labour Party), a freeze on Medicare Benefits Scheme indexation was announced as a temporary measure, to run until 2017. This put pressure on the ability of doctors to provide [[bulk billing]], which reduced access by people to free visits to a doctor. People on the lowest incomes increasingly chose to make less visits than they would have before.\n\nIn the [[2016 Australian federal budget]] (Coalition), the indexation freeze was extended to 2020. At the [[2019 Australian federal election|2019 federal election]], the Australian Labour Party (ALP) promised that if elected, they would unfreeze GP schedules a year early, a measure enacted by the eventually elected Coalition. \n\n====Mediscare====\nTowards the end of the campaign for the [[2016 Australian federal election]], a text claiming to be from \"Medicare\" was sent to certain electorates around the nation, saying \"Mr Turnbull's plans to privatise Medicare will take us down the road of no return. Time is running out to Save Medicare.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Mills |first1=Stephen |title=Three reasons why we should have seen Labor's 'Medicare SMS' coming |url=https://theconversation.com/three-reasons-why-we-should-have-seen-labors-medicare-sms-coming-62177 |website=The Conversation |language=en}}</ref> Leader of the Liberal Party, [[Malcolm Turnbull]], had not announced such plans, and [[Services Australia]] (known as Department of Human Services at the time) denied sending the message. It had instead been sent by the [[Australian Labor Party (Queensland Branch)|Queensland branch of the Australian Labor Party]]. The furore over the text brought attention to the value of Medicare to Australians. The affair was widely dubbed \"Mediscare,\" which in turn was used to describe fears of the Liberal National Party's alleged devolution of Medicare.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-08-02/mediscare-text-message-investigation-dropped-by-afp/7683390|title=AFP ends 'Mediscare' text message investigation|last=Doran|first=Matthew|last2=Patel|first2=Uma|date=2016-08-02|website=ABC News|language=en-AU|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref>\n\n==Funding of scheme==\n[[File:Total health expenditure per capita, US Dollars PPP.png|thumb|right|350px|Total health spending per capita, in [[United States dollar|U.S. dollars]] [[Purchasing power parity|PPP-adjusted]], of Australia compared amongst various other first world nations since 1995]]\n\n===Medicare levy===\nMedicare is presently nominally funded by an income tax surcharge, known as the ''Medicare levy'', which is currently 2% of a resident taxpayer's taxable income.<ref>{{cite web|title=Medicare levy |url=https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Medicare-levy/ |website=www.ato.gov.au |accessdate=28 February 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130629085049/http://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Medicare-levy/ |archivedate=29 June 2013 }}</ref> However, revenue raised by the levy falls far short of funding the entirety of Medicare expenditure, and any shortfall is paid out of general government expenditure.\n\nThe [[2013 Australian federal budget|2013 budget]] increased the Medicare levy from 1.5% to 2% from 1 July 2014, ostensibly to fund the [[National Disability Insurance Scheme]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Medicare levy increase to fund DisabilityCare Australia |url=https://www.ato.gov.au/General/New-legislation/In-detail/Direct-taxes/Income-tax-for-individuals/Medicare-Levy-increase-to-fund-DisabilityCare/|website=www.ato.gov.au|accessdate=28 February 2015|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402123923/https://www.ato.gov.au/General/New-legislation/In-detail/Direct-taxes/Income-tax-for-individuals/Medicare-Levy-increase-to-fund-DisabilityCare/|archivedate=2 April 2015}}</ref> The [[2017 Australian federal budget|2017 budget]] proposed to increase the Medicare levy from 2% to 2.5%, from 1 July 2018, but this proposal was scrapped on 25 April 2018.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theage.com.au/politics/federal/turnbull-government-to-scrap-8-billion-medicare-levy-increase-20180425-p4zbl1.html|title=Turnbull government to scrap $8 billion Medicare levy increase |first=Eryk|last=Bagshaw|date=25 April 2018|website=The Age}}</ref>\n\nWhen the levy is payable, it is calculated on the whole of an individual's taxable income, and not just the amount above the low-income threshold.\n\n===Low income exemptions ===\nLow income earners are exempt from the Medicare levy, with different exemption thresholds applying to singles, families, seniors and pensioners, with a phasing-in range. Since 2015\u201316, the exemptions have applied to taxable incomes below $21,335, or $33,738 for seniors and pensioners. The phasing-in range is for taxable incomes between $21,335 and $26,668, or $33,738 and $42,172 for seniors and pensioners.\n\n==Medicare rebates or benefits==\n===Medicare Benefits Schedule===\nMedicare sets a schedule of fees for medical services, called the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS),<ref>{{cite web |title=MBS Online |url=http://www.mbsonline.gov.au/ |publisher=Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing |language=en}}</ref> which is freely accessible online. The schedule fee is the government's standard cost of a particular medical service. The [[Australian Medical Association]] (the doctors' union) maintains a similar schedule called the ''AMA List of Medical Services and Fees''<ref>{{cite web |title=AMA Fees List |url=https://feeslist.ama.com.au/ |website=feeslist.ama.com.au |publisher=Australian Medical Association}}</ref> (AMA Fees List), which provides members with \"costing assistance and guidance\".

However, the government has allowed a large gap to grow between the MBS fees and what is charged in the market, in part by freezing indexation of the schedule fees for specialists from 2012 to 2020, and GPs from 2014 to 2020. It has been suggested that MBS schedule fees are now approximately 45% of the AMA list fees.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bulwinkel |first1=Kim |title=There seems little understanding... |url=https://theconversation.com/specialists-are-free-to-set-their-fees-but-there-are-ways-to-ensure-patients-dont-get-ripped-off-97372#comment_1626266 |website=The Conversation |language=en}}</ref> In 2019, the AMA produced a poster suggesting that if the MBS schedule fees had increased by the same amount as their members' costs, they would more than three times what they currently were.<ref>{{cite web |title=Why is there a gap? |url=https://feeslist.ama.com.au/resources-ama-gaps-poster |website=feeslist.ama.com.au |publisher=Australian Medical Association}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017 the AMA stated: \"Indexation of the MBS and the private schedules have not kept pace with the costs of providing medical care.

The out-of-pocket costs for Australians are continuing to increase, as a result of increases in healthcare costs above Medicare schedule increases, and also because a Medicare benefits freeze has been imposed over the last few years. Medical practitioners choosing to cease or cut back on bulk-billing also increases out-of-pocket costs to patients.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nIf a practitioner does not bulk bill a particular patient, that patient will receive a bill for the medical expenses and is obligated to pay the bill. The practitioner is paid the full amount of the bill. The patient is reimbursed by Medicare 85% of the schedule fee and is out-of-pocket for the balance of the bill. Medicare accumulates the gap amounts, which is the difference between the schedule fee and the 85% reimbursed by Medicare, paid by the patient, to determine when the safety net threshold is reached. After the threshold is reached, the patient is reimbursed for the balance of the schedule fee (i.e., 15%). In the three months to July 2016, 85.9% of GP visits were bulk billed, which fell to 85.4% in the three months to September 2016.<ref name=\"medistats\">{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/health/medicare-statistics-show-bulk-billing-is-falling/news-story/ef723aeac2a9ed6effaa44cf14669413|title=Bulk billing rates are falling|website=news.com.au}}</ref>\n\nMany medical practitioners charge more than the schedule fee, and the amount in excess of the schedule fee must be borne by the patient and is not counted towards the safety net threshold.\n\n===Medicare safety nets===\nTo provide additional relief to those who incur higher than usual medical costs, Medicare safety nets have been set up.

Out-of-pocket costs are the difference between the fee actually paid to the practitioner (subject to the fee cap) and the standard Medicare rebate.\n\nWhen introduced, the general threshold for singles and families was $700 and $300 for singles and families that hold a Commonwealth concession card, and families that received Family Tax Benefit Part (A) (FTB(A)) and families that qualify for notional FTB(A). On 1 January 2006, the thresholds were increased to $1,000 and $500 respectively. From then the EMSN was indexed by the Consumer Price Index on 1 January each year.<ref>[http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/Review_%20Extended_Medicare_Safety_Net/$File/ExtendedMedicareSafetyNetReview.pdf Extended Medicare Safety Net Review]</ref>\n\nSince 1 January 2010, some medical fees have been subject to an EMSN fee cap, so that the out-of-pocket costs used in determining whether the threshold has been reached are limited to that cap.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/EMSN2011-ExecutiveSummary|title=Extended Medicare Safety Net Review of Capping Arrangements Report 2011: Executive Summary|first=Australian Government Department of Health and|last=Ageing}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://hpm.org/en/Surveys/CHERE_-_Australia/14/The_Medicare_Safety_Net__review_and_response.html|title=HealthPolicyMonitor - Surveys- CHERE - Australia- 14- The Medicare Safety Net: review and response}}</ref> The EMSN fee cap also applies for any rebate that is paid once the EMSN threshold is reached.

will admit patients without a number or card and resolve Medicare eligibility issues after treatment.\n\nThe Medicare card will also be required when accessing medical, hospital or pharmaceutical services in a country with which Australia has a reciprocal health care agreement.\n\n==Practitioner review programs==\nThis is a basic overview of the practitioner review process in point form:\n* Medicare Australia provide a federal framework to deliver a health system to the people of Australia.\n* Delivering health care to millions relies on proper utilisation of limited resources.\n* As such, to make sure the services provided under the Medicare umbrella (including medicines administered by the PBS), reviews and audits are conducted.\n* To quote the Medicare website, \"identification and reviews of practitioners' practice profiles protect patients and the community from the risks and costs of inappropriate practice\".<ref>Medicare Australia's website: http://www.medicareaustralia.gov.au/</ref>\n* Inappropriate practice is defined twofold:\n** \"services that would be unacceptable to the general body of members\".\n** includes the rendering of \"80 or more professional attendances on each of 20 more days in a 12-month period\", i.e. rorting the system through false services rendered.\n* When practitioner is reviewed, their data is compared with that of their peers.\n* If this data is markedly different then this practitioner may be referred to the Practitioner Review Program.\n* If concerns still remain at the end of the Practitioner Review Program, then a referral to the Professional Services Review (PSR) can be made.\n* The PSR:\n** Practitioners are always contacted by the PSR when a review concerning them is conducted.\n** Practitioners covered by the PSR include all who provide services within the PBS and/or Medicare framework (this includes doctors, dentists, allied health professionals).\n** The Medical Director of the PSR acts as a last-ditch arbitrator.\n** The Medical Director will compare the reported case to random data.\n** The outcome may be no further action, a reprimand (administered by the Determining Authority), counseling, etc.<ref>Medicare Australia and the Professional Services Review System, Sara Bird, Australian Family Physician (Volume 37, Number 9), September 2008.</ref>\n\n==Reciprocal

territories) operated by [[Services Australia]] (formerly the Department of Human Services). Medicare is the main source of payment of [[health care in Australia]], either partially or fully covering the cost of most [[primary health care]] services for eligible citizens, residents and some visitors. Residents are entitled to a rebate for treatment by medical practitioners, eligible midwives, nurse practitioners and allied health professionals who have been issued a [[Medicare (Australia)#Medicare provider numbers|Medicare provider number]], and they can also obtain free treatment in state public hospitals. \n\nSome specialties and allied health services are at least partly covered by Medicare for certain patients with chronic illness. These services include [[ophthalmology]], [[physiotherapy]] and [[audiology]], but not most dental services.\n\nMedicare sets a schedule of fees, called the '''Medicare Benefits Schedule''' ('''MBS'''), formerly '''Commonwealth Medicare Benefits Schedule''' ('''CMBS'''); this schedule covers which services are covered, what the fee for that service is deemed to be, and the level (as a percentage) to which they are covered by Medicare rebates to the patient.\n\nThe scheme was created in 1975 by the [[Whitlam Government]] under the brand ''Medibank'', and was limited by the [[Fraser Government]] in 1976 to paying customers only. The [[Hawke Government]] reinstated universal health care in 1984 under the brand of ''Medicare''. [[Medibank]] continued to exist as a government-owned private health insurance provider until it was privatised by the [[Abbott Government]] in 2014.\n\n'''Reciprocal Health Care Agreements''' ('''RHCA''') are in place with the [[United Kingdom]], [[Sweden]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], [[Finland]], [[Norway]], [[Slovenia]], [[Malta]], [[Italy]], [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[New Zealand]], which entitles visitors from these countries limited access to public health care in Australia and eligible Australians to reciprocal rights while in one of these countries.\n\n==Constitutional framework==\nAustralia's Medicare scheme operates under power granted to the federal Parliament by [[s:Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act#Part V.--Powers of the Parliament.|Section 51 (xxiiiA) of the Commonwealth Constitution]], which was inserted by a [[Australian referendum, 1946 (Social Services)|referendum of 1946]], and gave the federal Parliament power, subject to the Constitution, to make laws with respect to: ''The provision of maternity allowances, widows' pensions, child endowment, unemployment, pharmaceutical, sickness and hospital benefits, medical and dental services (but not so as to authorise any form of civil conscription), benefits to students and family allowances.''\n\nThis empowers the Commonwealth to provide benefits under the Medicare scheme, but not to provide health care services directly. The operation of hospitals, for example, remains within the jurisdiction of the states and territories, and the Commonwealth must operate through their authority.\n\nPrivately run hospitals are also part of the Medicare scheme. Medicare benefits are payable for medical treatment provided to admitted patients of private hospitals as well as public hospitals. However, a patient in a private hospital (by definition, a private patient) would need private insurance coverage to help him or her meet any of the hospital charges such as accommodation costs, as well as some or all of the remainder of the doctor's charges above the 75% Medicare benefit.\n\n==History==\n\n===Health insurance prior to Medibank===\nThere was an increase in the number of [[Australians]] covered by health insurance plans following the end of the [[Second World War]]. However, a large proportion of the [[Australia]]n population continued to lack coverage for health risks in the early 1970s. In 1972, 17% of Australians outside of [[Queensland]] (which had a free public health care system<ref>Health Reform: Public Success, Private Failure by Daniel Drache and Terry Sullivan</ref>) were uninsured, most of whom were on low incomes.\n\n===Medibank (1975-76)===\nThe [[Whitlam government|Whitlam Labor government]], elected in 1972, sought to put an end to the two-tier system by extending healthcare coverage to the entire population.<ref>''Understanding the Australian Health Care System'' by Eileen Willis, Louise Reynolds, and Keleher Helen.</ref> Before the Labor Party came to office, [[Bill Hayden]], one of the Labor Party's front bench members of parliament, took the main responsibility for developing the preliminary plans to establish a universal health scheme.\n\nMedibank started on schedule on 1 July 1975.<ref name=\"medicbrief\">{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/library/intguide/SP/medicare.htm |title=Medicare \u2013 Background Brief |last=Biggs |first=Amanda |date=29 October 2004 |work=Parliament of Australia: Parliamentary Library |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia |accessdate=16 April 2010 |location=Canberra, ACT |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207065307/http://www.aph.gov.au/library/intguide/SP/medicare.htm |archivedate= 7 February 2012 }}</ref> In nine months, the [[Health Insurance Commission]] (HIC) had increased its staff from 22 to 3500, opened 81 offices, installed 31 minicomputers, 633 terminals and 10 medium-sized computers linked by land-lines to the central computer, and issued registered health insurance cards to 90% of the Australian population.\n\n===Medibank Mark II (1976-81)===\nAfter a change of government at the [[Australian federal election, 1975|December 1975 election]], the [[Fraser Government|Fraser Coalition government]] established the Medibank Review Committee in January 1976. This lead to legislative changes, and the launch of 'Medibank Mark II' on 1 October 1976.\n\nAlso that year, the Fraser government also passed the [[Medibank Private]] bill, that allowed the HIC to enter the private health insurance business. \n\nIn 1978, [[bulk billing]] was restricted to pensioners and the socially disadvantaged. Rebates were reduced to 75% of the schedule fee. The health insurance levy was also scrapped that year.\n\nIn 1979, Medibank rebates were cut further. In 1981, access to Medibank was restricted further, and an income tax rebate was introduced for holders of private health insurance to encourage it's uptake.\n\nFinally, the original Medibank was dissolved entirely in late 1981, leaving behind Medibank Private.\n\n===Medicare (1984-current)===\nOn 1 February 1984, the original Medibank model was reinstated by the [[Hawke Government|Hawke Labor government]], but renamed Medicare to distinguish it from Medibank Private which continued to exist.\n\n====Easyclaim and successors====\nEasyclaim was launched in 2006, under which a patient would pay the medical practitioner the consultation fee and the receptionist would send a message to Medicare to release the amount of rebate due to the patient's designated bank account. The rebate amount would take into account the patient's concession status and thresholds. In effect, the patient only pays the gap.<ref>https://www.humanservices.gov.au/organisations/health-professionals/services/medicare/medicare-easyclaim/about/what-you-need-know</ref> In recent years, this has largely been replaced with the [[National Australia Bank]] service HICAPS (Health Insurance Claim At Point of Sale)<ref>{{cite web |title=HICAPS |url=https://www.hicaps.com.au/ |website=www.hicaps.com.au |language=en}}</ref>. For providers not using HICAPS, patients can make claims on-the-spot (where Medicare will pay the patient at a later date), online, through the Medicare mobile apps, or at joint Medicare-Centrelink Service Centres.\n\nServices like these have greatly reduced the need for people to visit Medicare service centres, all of which have been merged into [[Centrelink]] or ''myGov'' shopfronts.\n\n====Better Access Scheme====\nThe [[Better Access Scheme]] extends Medicare to cover more [[allied health]] services than it did previously, especially in the area of [[mental health]]. It became available in November 2006.\n\n====National Disability Insurance Scheme====\nA long-standing criticism of the Medicare schedule was it's limited coverage of services to improve the lives of people with disability. This was addressed when the [[2013 Australian federal budget]] (ALP) established the [[National Disability Insurance Scheme]], which was progressively rolled out across the country between 2013 and 2020. It provides funding for health services beyond those in the Medicare schedule, and is administered by the National Disability Insurance Agency, an independent government agency.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ndis.gov.au/about-us|title=About us|last=National Disability Insurance Agency|first=|date=|website=National Disability Insurance Scheme|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref>\n\n====MBS indexation freeze====\nIn the [[2013 Australian federal budget]] (Australian Labour Party), a freeze on Medicare Benefits Scheme indexation was announced as a temporary measure, to run until 2017. This put pressure on the ability of doctors to provide [[bulk billing]], which reduced access by people to free visits to a doctor. People on the lowest incomes increasingly chose to make less visits than they would have before.\n\nIn the [[2016 Australian federal budget]] (Coalition), the indexation freeze was extended to 2020. At the [[2019 Australian federal election|2019 federal election]], the Australian Labour Party (ALP) promised that if elected, they would unfreeze GP schedules a year early, a measure enacted by the eventually elected Coalition. \n\n====Mediscare====\nTowards the end of the campaign for the [[2016 Australian federal election]], a text claiming to be from \"Medicare\" was sent to certain electorates around the nation, saying \"Mr Turnbull's plans to privatise Medicare will take us down the road of no return.

The out-of-pocket costs for Australians are continuing to increase, as a result of increases in healthcare costs above Medicare schedule increases, and also because a Medicare benefits freeze has been imposed over the last few years. Medical practitioners choosing to cease or cut back on bulk-billing also increases out-of-pocket costs to patients.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nIf a practitioner does not bulk bill a particular patient, that patient will receive a bill for the medical expenses and is obligated to pay the bill. The practitioner is paid the full amount of the bill. The patient is reimbursed by Medicare 85% of the schedule fee and is out-of-pocket for the balance of the bill. Medicare accumulates the gap amounts, which is the difference between the schedule fee and the 85% reimbursed by Medicare, paid by the patient, to determine when the safety net threshold is reached. After the threshold is reached, the patient is reimbursed for the balance of the schedule fee (i.e., 15%).

Out-of-pocket costs are the difference between the fee actually paid to the practitioner (subject to the fee cap) and the standard Medicare rebate.\n\nWhen introduced, the general threshold for singles and families was $700 and $300 for singles and families that hold a Commonwealth concession card, and families that received Family Tax Benefit Part (A) (FTB(A)) and families that qualify for notional FTB(A). On 1 January 2006 the thresholds were increased to $1,000 and $500 respectively.

'''Medicare Australia''' was the responsible agency for the scheme until it was dissolved in 2011 into the Department of Human Services.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2011A00032/Html/Text|title=Human Services Legislation Amendment Act 2011|last=Australia|first=Services|website=www.legislation.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2019-10-09}}</ref> Currently, Services Australia operates the scheme in consultation with the national [[Department of Health (Australia)|Department of Health]] and other health-related agencies such as the [[Australian Organ Donor Register]] and state health services (for example, [[Queensland Health]]).\n\n===Medicare provider numbers===\nMedicare issues to eligible health professionals a unique Medicare provider number to enable them to participate in the Medicare scheme. The provider number is required to appear on the practitioners\u2019 bills, prescriptions or service requests (referrals) that are eligible for a Medicare benefit. A practitioner may have more than one number, if, for example, they practise from more than one location.\n\n===Medicare card===\nMedicare issues each person entitled to receive benefits under the scheme with a [[Medicare card (Australia)|Medicare card]] which has a number that must be used when making a claim. The card must be produced or the Medicare number provided if the Medicare rebate is paid directly to the doctor under the [[bulk billing]] system; and in its absence the doctor cannot bulk bill for the consultation. The doctor is permitted to keep a record of the patient's card number and use it at subsequent visits.\n\nIt is also necessary to provide a card number (although not necessarily show the card) to gain access to the public hospital system to be treated as a public patient.<ref>[http://www.hcf.com.au/media_center.asp?ID=17&member_id=Guest \"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100304080957/http://www.hcf.com.au/media_center.asp?ID=17&member_id=Guest |date=4 March 2010 }}</ref> For non-elective treatment (e.g. emergency), public hospitals will admit patients without a number or card and resolve Medicare eligibility issues after treatment.\n\nThe Medicare card will also be required when accessing medical, hospital or pharmaceutical services in a country with which Australia has a reciprocal health care agreement.\n\n==Practitioner review programs==\nThis is a basic overview of the practitioner review process in point form:\n* Medicare Australia provide a federal framework to deliver a health system to the people of Australia.\n* Delivering health care to millions relies on proper utilisation of limited resources.\n* As such, to make sure the services provided under the Medicare umbrella (including medicines administered by the PBS), reviews and audits are conducted.\n* To quote the Medicare website, \"identification and reviews of practitioners' practice profiles protect patients and the community from the risks and costs of inappropriate practice\".<ref>Medicare Australia's website: http://www.medicareaustralia.gov.au/</ref>\n* Inappropriate practice is defined twofold:\n** \"services that would be unacceptable to the general body of members\".\n** includes the rendering of \"80 or more professional attendances on each of 20 more days in a 12-month period\", i.e. rorting the system through false services rendered.\n* When practitioner is reviewed, their data is compared with that of their peers.\n* If this data is markedly different then this practitioner may be referred to the Practitioner Review Program.\n* If concerns still remain at the end of the Practitioner Review Program, then a referral to the Professional Services Review (PSR) can be made.\n* The PSR:\n** Practitioners are always contacted by the PSR when a review concerning them is conducted.\n** Practitioners covered by the PSR include all who provide services within the PBS and/or Medicare framework (this includes doctors, dentists, allied health professionals).\n** The Medical Director of the PSR acts as a last-ditch arbitrator.\n** The Medical Director will compare the reported case to random data.\n** The outcome may be no further action, a reprimand (administered by the Determining Authority), counseling, etc.<ref>Medicare Australia and the Professional Services Review System, Sara Bird, Australian Family Physician (Volume 37, Number 9), September 2008.</ref>\n\n==Reciprocal agreements==\nReciprocal Health Care Agreements (RHCA) are in place with the United Kingdom, Sweden, the Netherlands, Belgium, Finland, Norway, Slovenia, Malta, Italy, Republic of Ireland and New Zealand, which entitles visitors from these countries limited access to public health care in Australia (often only for emergencies and critical care), and entitles eligible Australians to reciprocal rights while in one of these countries.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.humanservices.gov.au/customer/services/medicare/reciprocal-health-care-agreements|title = Reciprocal Health Care
