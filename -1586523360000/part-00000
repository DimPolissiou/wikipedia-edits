In 1839, [[Juan Bautista Alvarado]], [[List of Governors of California before 1850|Mexican governor]] of [[Alta California]], granted the responsibility of colonizing the [[Sacramento Valley]] to [[Swiss]]-born Mexican citizen [[John Sutter|John Augustus Sutter]], who subsequently established [[Sutter's Fort]] and the settlement at the ''Rancho [[New Helvetia|Nueva Helvetia]].'' Following the American [[Conquest of California]] and the 1848 [[Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo]], the waterfront developed by Sutter began to be developed, and incorporated in 1850 as the City of Sacramento. As a result of the [[California Gold Rush]], Sacramento became a major commercial center and distribution point for Northern California, serving as the terminus for the [[Pony Express]] and the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]].\n\nSacramento is the fastest-growing major city in California,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Caraccio|first1=David|title=Sacramento is fastest growing big city in California|url=http://www.sacbee.com/news/local/article148080179.html|newspaper=The Sacramento Bee|accessdate=May 3, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170502214127/http://www.sacbee.com/news/local/article148080179.html|archive-date=May 2, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> owing to its status as a notable [[finance|financial]] center on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] and as a major educational hub, home of [[California State University, Sacramento]] and [[University of California, Davis]].

Soon, the colony began to grow as more and more pioneers headed west. Within just a few short years, Sutter Sr. had become a grand success, owning a ten-acre orchard and a herd of thirteen thousand cattle. Fort Sutter became a regular stop for the increasing number of immigrants coming through the valley. In 1847 Sutter Sr. received 2,000 fruit trees, which started the agriculture industry in the Sacramento Valley. Later that year, Sutter Sr. hired James Marshall to build a sawmill so he could continue to expand his empire,<ref name=\"legendsofamerica.com\" /> however, unbeknownst to many, Sutter Sr.'s \"empire\" had been built on thin margins of credit.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/johnsutterlifeon00hurt/page/83 <!-- quote=his father's loose business habits. --> John Sutter: A Life on the North American Frontier] By Albert L.

Marshall]] at [[Sutters Mill|Sutter's Mill]] in [[Coloma, California|Coloma]] (some {{convert|50|mi|km|1|sp=us}} northeast of the fort), a large number of gold-seekers came to the area, increasing the population. In August 1848 Sutter Sr.'s son, [[John Augustus Sutter Jr.|John Sutter Jr.]], arrived in the area to assist his father in relieving his indebtedness. Now compounding the problem of his father's indebtedness, was the additional strain placed on the Sutters by the ongoing arrival of thousands of new gold miners and prospectors in the area, many quite content to squat on unwatched portions of the vast Sutter lands, or to abscond with various unattended Sutter properties or belongings if they could. In Sutter's case, rather than being a 'boon' for Sutter, his employee's discovery of gold in the area turned out to be more of a personal 'bane' for him.\n\nBy December 1848, John Sutter Jr., in association with [[Sam Brannan]], began laying out the City of Sacramento, 2 miles south of his father's settlement of New Helvetia. This venture was undertaken against the wishes of Sutter Sr., however, the father, being deeply in debt, was in no position to stop the venture. For commercial reasons, the new city was named \"Sacramento City,\" after the [[Sacramento River]]. Sutter Jr. and Brannon hired topographical engineer William H. Warner to draft the official layout of the city, which included 26 lettered and 31 numbered streets (today's grid from C St. to Broadway and from Front St. to Alhambra Blvd.). Unfortunately, a certain bitterness grew between the elder Sutter and his [[John Augustus Sutter Jr.|son]] as Sacramento became an overnight commercial success (Sutter's Fort, Mill and the town of [[Sutterville, California|Sutterville]], all founded by [[John Sutter]] Sr., would eventually fail).\n\nThe citizens of Sacramento adopted a city charter in 1849, which was recognized by the state legislature in 1850. Sacramento is the oldest [[municipal corporation|incorporated]] city in California, incorporated on February 27, 1850.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cityofsacramento.org/about_the_city.htm |title=About the City of Sacramento |publisher=City of Sacramento |date= |access-date=November 16, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121123091648/http://www.cityofsacramento.org/about_the_city.htm |archive-date=November 23, 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> During the early 1850s, the Sacramento valley was devastated by floods, fires and cholera epidemics. Despite this, because of its position just downstream from the [[Mother Lode]] in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], the new city grew, quickly reaching a population of 10,000.\n{{multiple image\n | direction =    vertical\n | align = left\n | footer = [[Old Sacramento State Historic Park|Old Sacramento]] is the settlement that grew out of [[Sutter's Fort]].\n | image1 =Sacramento, CA USA - panoramio (10).jpg\n | image2 =Delta King.JPG\n}}\nThe [[California State Legislature]], with the support of Governor [[John Bigler]], moved to Sacramento in 1854. The capital of California under Spanish (and, subsequently, Mexican) rule had been [[Monterey, California|Monterey]], where, in 1849, the first Constitutional Convention and state elections were held. The convention decided [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] would be the new state's capital. After 1850, when California's statehood was ratified, the legislature met in San Jose until 1851, [[Vallejo, California|Vallejo]] in 1852, and [[Benicia, California|Benicia]] in 1853, before moving to Sacramento. In the [[California Constitutional Conventions|Sacramento Constitutional Convention of 1879]], Sacramento was named to be the permanent state capital.\n\nBegun in 1860 to be reminiscent of the [[United States Capitol]] in Washington, D.C., the [[Classical Revival]] style [[California State Capitol]] was completed in 1874. In 1861, the legislative session was moved to the Merchants Exchange Building in San Francisco for one session because of massive flooding in Sacramento. The legislative chambers were first occupied in 1869 while construction continued. From 1862 to 1868, part of the [[Leland Stanford Mansion State Historic Park|Leland Stanford Mansion]] was used for the governor's offices during Stanford's tenure as the Governor; and the legislature met in the Sacramento County Courthouse.\n\nWith its new status and strategic location, Sacramento quickly prospered and became the western end of the [[Pony Express]]. Later it became a terminus of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]], which began construction in Sacramento in 1863 and was financed by \"[[The Big Four (Central Pacific Railroad)|The Big Four]]\"\u2014[[Mark Hopkins Jr.|Mark Hopkins]], [[Charles Crocker]], [[Collis P. Huntington]], and [[Leland Stanford]]. Both the American and especially Sacramento rivers would be key elements in the economic success of the city. In fact, Sacramento effectively controlled commerce on these rivers, and public works projects were funded through taxes levied on goods unloaded from boats and loaded onto rail cars in the historic [[Sacramento Railyards|Sacramento Rail Yards]].\n\nIn 1850 and again in [[Great Flood of 1862|1861]], Sacramento citizens were faced with a completely flooded town. In 1861, Governor Leland Stanford, who was inaugurated in early January 1861, had to attend his inauguration in a rowboat, which was not too far from his house in town on N street. The flood waters were so bad, the legend says, that when he returned to his house, he had to enter into it through the second floor window. From 1862 until the mid-1870s Sacramento raised the level of its downtown by building reinforced brick walls on its downtown streets, and filling the resulting street walls with dirt. Thus the previous first floors of buildings became the [[basement]]s, with open space between the street and the building, previously the sidewalk, now at the basement level. Over the years, many of these underground spaces have been filled or destroyed by subsequent development. However, it is still possible to view portions of the \"[[Old Sacramento State Historic Park#Old Sacramento Underground|Sacramento Underground]]\".\n\n=== Modern era ===\n[[File:Tower Bridge Sacramento edit.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tower Bridge (California)|Tower Bridge]], which connects Sacramento to [[West Sacramento]], was built in 1935 and is a [[California Historical Landmarks in Sacramento County, California|California Historical Landmark]].]]\n{{See also|Urban redevelopment in Sacramento, California}}\nThe city's current charter was adopted by voters in 1920.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sacbee.com/<!-- Incomplete URL --> |page= |newspaper=[[Sacramento Bee]] |date=September 26, 2009 |section= |title=Status quo for city governance? |author= |access-date=November 21, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120223741/http://www.sacbee.com/ |archive-date=November 20, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> As a [[charter city]], Sacramento is exempt from many laws and regulations passed by the [[California State Legislature|state legislature]].

The camp was one of fifteen temporary detention facilities where over 110,000 [[Japanese Americans]], two-thirds of them U.S. citizens, were held while construction on the more permanent [[War Relocation Authority]] camps was completed. The assembly center was built on the site of a former migrant labor camp, and inmates began arriving from Sacramento and San Joaquin Counties on May 6, 1942. It closed after only 52 days, on June 26, and the population of 4,739 was transferred to the [[Tule Lake Unit, World War II Valor in the Pacific National Monument|Tule Lake]] concentration camp. The site was then turned over to the Army Signal Corps and dedicated as [[Camp Kohler]].\n[[File:Ford rushed from Sacramento assassination attempt image A6320-24A.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Gerald Ford assassination attempt in Sacramento|1975 assassination attempt]] of President [[Gerald Ford]] in [[Capitol Park (Sacramento, California)|Capitol Park]].]]\nAfter the war and the end of the incarceration program, returning Japanese Americans were often unable to find housing and so 234 families temporarily lived at the former assembly center.

The 1980s and 1990s saw the closure of several local military bases: [[McClellan Air Force Base]], [[Mather Air Force Base]], and Sacramento Army Depot. In 1980, there was another flood.\n\nIn spite of military base closures and the decline of agricultural food processing, Sacramento has continued to experience population growth in recent years. Primary sources of population growth are an influx of residents from the nearby [[San Francisco Bay Area]], as well as immigration from Asia and Latin America. In 1985, Hugh Scrutton, a 38-year-old Sacramento, California, computer store owner, was killed by a nail-and-splinter-loaded bomb placed in the parking lot of his store. In 1996, his death was attributed to the Unabomber, [[Theodore Kaczynski]].\n\nAfter acquiring the majority stake in the [[Sacramento Kings]], the team's new owner, [[Vivek Ranadiv\u00e9]] with the help of the city, agreed to build a new Arena in the downtown area.

The [[Sacramento Convention Center Complex]] governs both the [[Community Center Theatre]] and [[Memorial Auditorium (Sacramento)|Memorial Auditorium]]. The [[H Street Theatre Complex]] consists of the [[Wells Fargo Pavilion]], built in 2003 atop the old Music Circus tent foundations, the McClatchy Mainstage and the Pollock Stage, originally built as a television studio and renovated at the same time the Pavilion was built. These smaller venues seat 300 and 90, offering a more intimate presentation than the 2300-seat Pavilion. The newest venue in the city, the [[Sophia Tsakopoulos Center for the Arts|Sofia Tsakopoulos Center for the Arts]], consists of the 365-seat Sutter Theatre for Children and the Mainstage, seating 250.\n\nProfessional theatre is represented in Sacramento by a number of companies. [[Broadway Sacramento]] and its locally produced [[Summer stock theatre]], [[Broadway at Music Circus]], lures many directors, performers, and artists from New York and Los Angeles to work alongside a large local staff at the [[Wells Fargo Pavilion]]. During the fall, winter and spring seasons Broadway Sacramento brings bus and truck tours to the [[Community Center Theater]]. Resident at the [[H Street Theatre Complex]] for the remainder of the year (from September to May), the [[Sacramento Theatre Company]] prepares to celebrate its 75th season, beginning in the Fall of 2019. In addition to a traditional regional theatre fare of classical plays and musicals, the Sacramento Theatre Company has a large School of the Arts with a variety of opportunities for arts education. The [[B Street Theatre]], having completed its 2018 move into the new [[Sophia Tsokopoulos Center for the Arts|Sofia Tsakopoulos Center for the Arts]], continues its pursuit of producing smaller and more intimate professional works for families and children. Rounding out the professional companies is [[Capital Stage]], which performed aboard the Delta King until the end of the 2010\u20132011 season and soon took up residence at its own venue along the J-Street corridor.\n\nThe Sacramento area has one of the largest collection of community theatres in California. Some of these include the Thistle Dew Dessert Theatre and Playwrights Workshop, Davis Musical Theatre Co., El Dorado Musical Theatre, Runaway Stage Productions, River City Theatre Company, Flying Monkey Productions, The Actor's Theatre, KOLT Run Productions, Kookaburra Productions, Big Idea Theatre, Celebration Arts, Lambda Player, Light Opera Theatre of Sacramento, Synergy Stage and the historic Eagle Theatre. The [[Sacramento Shakespeare Festival]] provides entertainment under the stars every summer in William Land Park. Many of these theatres compete annually for the Elly Awards overseen by The Sacramento Area Regional Theatre Alliance or SARTA.\n\n=== Visual arts ===\nThe [[Sacramento Metropolitan Arts Commission]] is an organization that was established as the Sacramento [[arts council]] in 1977 to provide several arts programs for the city. These include Art in Public Places, Arts Education, Grants and Cultural Programs, Poet Laureate Program, Arts Stabilization Programs and Other Resources and opportunities.\n\nSacramento Second Saturday Art Walk is a program of local art galleries that stay open into the late evenings every second Saturday of each month, providing a unique experience for the local population as well as tourists to view original art and meet the artists themselves.\n\n=== Museums ===\n[[File:Crocker Museum in Sacramento Ca..JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.13|The [[Crocker Art Museum]] is the oldest public [[art museum]] in the [[Western United States]] and has one of the premier public art collections in the country.]]\nSacramento has several major museums.

The modern architecture is very different from the museum's original Victorian style building. Construction was completed in 2010.\n\nAlso of interest is the [[Governor's Mansion State Historic Park]], a large Victorian Mansion which was home to 13 of California's Governors, as well as the official residence for former governor [[Jerry Brown]] following renovations in 2015. The [[Leland Stanford Mansion State Historic Park]], which was completely restored in 2006, serves as the State's official address for diplomatic and business receptions. Guided public tours are available. [[The California Museum for History, Women, and the Arts]], home of the [[California Hall of Fame]], is a cultural destination dedicated to telling the rich history of California and its unique influence on the world of ideas, innovation, art and culture. The museum educates tens of thousands of school children through inspiring programs, sharing with world visitors California's rich art, history and cultural legacy through dynamic exhibits, and serving as a public forum and international meeting place.\n\nThe [[California State Railroad Museum]] in Old Sacramento has historical exhibits and live steam locomotives that patrons may ride. The [[California Automobile Museum]], just south of Old Sacramento, is filled with automotive history and vehicles from 1880 to 2006 and is the oldest non-profit automotive museum in the West. The mission of it is to preserve, promote, and teach automotive culture and its influence on our lives\u2014past, present and future. In addition, the [[Sacramento History Museum]], in the heart of Old Sacramento, focuses on the history of Sacramento from the region's pre-Gold Rush history through the present day.\n\nThere is a Museum Day held in Sacramento every year, when 26 museums in the greater Sacramento area offer free admission. The 2009 Sacramento Museum Day brought out more than 80,000 people, the largest number the event has gathered.

Most arrived at San Francisco, which was then the largest city in California and known as \"D\u00e0 B\u00f9\" (\"Big Port\", Chinese: \u5927\u57e0, [[Jyutping]]: ''daai<sup>6</sup> fau<sup>6</sup>''). Some eventually came to Sacramento, then the second-largest city in California and consequently called \"Yee Fow\" (\"Second City\", Chinese: \u4e8c\u57e0, Jyutping: ''ji<sup>6</sup> fau<sup>6</sup>''). Today the city is known as \u8428\u514b\u62c9\u95e8\u6258 ([[pinyin]]: ''S\u00e0k\u00e8l\u0101m\u00e9ntu\u014d'') by Mainland Chinese and as \u6c99\u52a0\u7dec\u5ea6 (pinyin: ''Sh\u0101ji\u0101mi\u01cendu\u00f3'') by Taiwanese.\n\nSacramento's [[Chinatowns in the United States|Chinatown]] was on \"I\" Street from Second to Sixth Streets. At the time, this area of \"I\" Street was considered a health hazard because, lying within a levee zone, it was lower than other parts of the city, which were situated on higher land. Throughout Sacramento's Chinatown history, there were fires, acts of discrimination, and prejudicial legislation such as the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] that was not repealed until 1943. The mysterious fires were thought to be set off by those who did not take a liking to the Chinese working class.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newsreview.com/sacramento/content?oid=344958 |title=Sacramento's Chinatown \u2013 News \u2013 Local Stories \u2013 June 28, 2007 |work=Sacramento News & Review |date= |access-date=November 16, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009230841/http://www.newsreview.com/sacramento/Content?oid=344958 |archive-date=October 9, 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref> Ordinances on what was viable building material were set into place to try to get the Chinese to move out. Newspapers such as [[The Sacramento Union]] wrote stories at the time that portrayed the Chinese in an unfavorable light to inspire ethnic discrimination and drive the Chinese away. As the years passed, a railroad was created over parts of the Chinatown, and further policies and laws would make it even harder for Chinese workers to sustain a living in Sacramento.\n\nWhile most of Sacramento's Chinatown has now been razed, a small Chinatown mall remains as well as a museum dedicated to the history of Sacramento's Chinatown and the contributions Chinese Americans have made to the city.

Following the American [[Conquest of California]] and the 1848 [[Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo]], the waterfront developed by Sutter began to be developed, and incorporated in 1850 as the City of Sacramento.

Soon, the colony began to grow as more and more pioneers headed west. Within just a few short years, Sutter Sr. had become a grand success, owning a ten-acre orchard and a herd of thirteen thousand cattle. Fort Sutter became a regular stop for the increasing number of immigrants coming through the valley. In 1847 Sutter Sr. received 2,000 fruit trees, which started the agriculture industry in the Sacramento Valley. Later that year, Sutter Sr. hired James Marshall to build a sawmill so he could continue to expand his empire,<ref name=\"legendsofamerica.com\" /> however, unbeknownst to many, Sutter Sr.'s \"empire\" had been built on thin margins of credit.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/johnsutterlifeon00hurt/page/83 <!-- quote=his father's loose business habits. --> John Sutter: A Life on the North American Frontier] By Albert L.

Marshall]] at [[Sutters Mill|Sutter's Mill]] in [[Coloma, California|Coloma]] (some {{convert|50|mi|km|1|sp=us}} northeast of the fort), a large number of gold-seekers came to the area, increasing the population. In August 1848 Sutter Sr.'s son, [[John Augustus Sutter Jr.|John Sutter Jr.]], arrived in the area to assist his father in relieving his indebtedness. Now compounding the problem of his father's indebtedness, was the additional strain placed on the Sutters by the ongoing arrival of thousands of new gold miners and prospectors in the area, many quite content to squat on unwatched portions of the vast Sutter lands, or to abscond with various unattended Sutter properties or belongings if they could. In Sutter's case, rather than being a 'boon' for Sutter, his employee's discovery of gold in the area turned out to be more of a personal 'bane' for him.\n\nBy December 1848, John Sutter Jr., in association with [[Sam Brannan]], began laying out the City of Sacramento, 2 miles south of his father's settlement of New Helvetia. This venture was undertaken against the wishes of Sutter Sr., however the father, being deeply in debt, was in no position to stop the venture. For commercial reasons the new city was named \"Sacramento City,\" after the [[Sacramento River]]. Sutter Jr. and Brannon hired topographical engineer William H. Warner to draft the official layout of the city, which included 26 lettered and 31 numbered streets (today's grid from C St. to Broadway and from Front St. to Alhambra Blvd.). Unfortunately, a certain bitterness grew between the elder Sutter and his [[John Augustus Sutter Jr.|son]] as Sacramento became an overnight commercial success (Sutter's Fort, Mill and the town of [[Sutterville, California|Sutterville]], all founded by [[John Sutter]] Sr., would eventually fail).\n\nThe citizens of Sacramento adopted a city charter in 1849, which was recognized by the state legislature in 1850. Sacramento is the oldest [[municipal corporation|incorporated]] city in California, incorporated on February 27, 1850.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cityofsacramento.org/about_the_city.htm |title=About the City of Sacramento |publisher=City of Sacramento |date= |access-date=November 16, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121123091648/http://www.cityofsacramento.org/about_the_city.htm |archive-date=November 23, 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> During the early 1850s, the Sacramento valley was devastated by floods, fires and cholera epidemics. Despite this, because of its position just downstream from the [[Mother Lode]] in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], the new city grew, quickly reaching a population of 10,000.\n{{multiple image\n | direction =    vertical\n | align = left\n | footer = [[Old Sacramento State Historic Park|Old Sacramento]] is the settlement that grew out of [[Sutter's Fort]].\n | image1 =Sacramento, CA USA - panoramio (10).jpg\n | image2 =Delta King.JPG\n}}\nThe [[California State Legislature]], with the support of Governor [[John Bigler]], moved to Sacramento in 1854. The capital of California under Spanish (and, subsequently, Mexican) rule had been [[Monterey, California|Monterey]], where in 1849 the first Constitutional Convention and state elections were held. The convention decided [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] would be the new state's capital. After 1850, when California's statehood was ratified, the legislature met in San Jose until 1851, [[Vallejo, California|Vallejo]] in 1852, and [[Benicia, California|Benicia]] in 1853, before moving to Sacramento. In the [[California Constitutional Conventions|Sacramento Constitutional Convention of 1879]], Sacramento was named to be the permanent state capital.\n\nBegun in 1860 to be reminiscent of the [[United States Capitol]] in Washington, D.C., the [[Classical Revival]] style [[California State Capitol]] was completed in 1874. In 1861, the legislative session was moved to the Merchants Exchange Building in San Francisco for one session because of massive flooding in Sacramento. The legislative chambers were first occupied in 1869 while construction continued. From 1862 to 1868, part of the [[Leland Stanford Mansion State Historic Park|Leland Stanford Mansion]] was used for the governor's offices during Stanford's tenure as the Governor; and the legislature met in the Sacramento County Courthouse.\n\nWith its new status and strategic location, Sacramento quickly prospered and became the western end of the [[Pony Express]]. Later it became a terminus of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]], which began construction in Sacramento in 1863 and was financed by \"[[The Big Four (Central Pacific Railroad)|The Big Four]]\"\u2014[[Mark Hopkins Jr.|Mark Hopkins]], [[Charles Crocker]], [[Collis P. Huntington]], and [[Leland Stanford]]. Both the American and especially Sacramento rivers would be key elements in the economic success of the city. In fact, Sacramento effectively controlled commerce on these rivers, and public works projects were funded though taxes levied on goods unloaded from boats and loaded onto rail cars in the historic [[Sacramento Railyards|Sacramento Rail Yards]].\n\nIn 1850 and again in [[Great Flood of 1862|1861]], Sacramento citizens were faced with a completely flooded town. In 1861, Governor Leland Stanford, who was inaugurated in early January 1861, had to attend his inauguration in a rowboat, which was not too far from his house in town on N street. The flood waters were so bad, the legend says, that when he returned to his house, he had to enter into it through the second floor window. From 1862 until the mid-1870s Sacramento raised the level of its downtown by building reinforced brick walls on its downtown streets, and filling the resulting street walls with dirt. Thus the previous first floors of buildings became the [[basement]]s, with open space between the street and the building, previously the sidewalk, now at the basement level. Over the years, many of these underground spaces have been filled or destroyed by subsequent development. However, it is still possible to view portions of the \"[[Old Sacramento State Historic Park#Old Sacramento Underground|Sacramento Underground]]\".\n\n=== Modern era ===\n[[File:Tower Bridge Sacramento edit.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tower Bridge (California)|Tower Bridge]], which connects Sacramento to [[West Sacramento]], was built in 1935 and is a [[California Historical Landmarks in Sacramento County, California|California Historical Landmark]].]]\n{{See also|Urban redevelopment in Sacramento, California}}\nThe city's current charter was adopted by voters in 1920.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sacbee.com/<!-- Incomplete URL --> |page= |newspaper=[[Sacramento Bee]] |date=September 26, 2009 |section= |title=Status quo for city governance? |author= |access-date=November 21, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120223741/http://www.sacbee.com/ |archive-date=November 20, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> As a [[charter city]], Sacramento is exempt from many laws and regulations passed by the [[California State Legislature|state legislature]].

The camp was one of fifteen temporary detention facilities where over 110,000 [[Japanese Americans]], two-thirds of them U.S. citizens, were held while construction on the more permanent [[War Relocation Authority]] camps was completed. The assembly center was built on the site of a former migrant labor camp, and inmates began arriving from Sacramento and San Joaquin Counties on May 6, 1942. It closed after only 52 days, on June 26, and the population of 4,739 was transferred to the [[Tule Lake Unit, World War II Valor in the Pacific National Monument|Tule Lake]] concentration camp. The site was then turned over to the Army Signal Corps and dedicated as [[Camp Kohler]].\n[[File:Ford rushed from Sacramento assassination attempt image A6320-24A.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Gerald Ford assassination attempt in Sacramento|1975 assassination attempt]] of President [[Gerald Ford]] in [[Capitol Park (Sacramento, California)|Capitol Park]].]]\nAfter the war and the end of the incarceration program, returning Japanese Americans were often unable to find housing and so 234 families temporarily lived at the former assembly center.

The 1980s and 1990s saw the closure of several local military bases: [[McClellan Air Force Base]], [[Mather Air Force Base]], and Sacramento Army Depot. In 1980, there was another flood.\n\nIn spite of military base closures and the decline of agricultural food processing, Sacramento has continued to experience population growth in recent years. Primary sources of population growth are an influx of residents from the nearby [[San Francisco Bay Area]], as well as immigration from Asia and Latin America. In 1985, Hugh Scrutton, a 38-year-old Sacramento, California, computer store owner, was killed by a nail-and-splinter-loaded bomb placed in the parking lot of his store.

Much of the land to the west of the city (in [[Yolo County, California|Yolo County]]) is permanently reserved for a vast flood control basin (the [[Yolo Bypass]]), due to the city's historical vulnerability to floods.

The [[Sacramento Convention Center Complex]] governs both the [[Community Center Theatre]] and [[Memorial Auditorium (Sacramento)|Memorial Auditorium]]. The [[H Street Theatre Complex]] consists of the [[Wells Fargo Pavilion]], built in 2003 atop the old Music Circus tent foundations, the McClatchy Mainstage and the Pollock Stage, originally built as a television studio and renovated at the same time the Pavilion was built. These smaller venues seat 300 and 90, offering a more intimate presentation than the 2300-seat Pavilion. The newest venue in the city, the [[Sophia Tsakopoulos Center for the Arts|Sofia Tsakopoulos Center for the Arts]], consists of the 365-seat Sutter Theatre for Children and the Mainstage, seating 250.\n\nProfessional theatre is represented in Sacramento by a number of companies. [[Broadway Sacramento]] and its locally produced [[Summer stock theatre]], [[Broadway at Music Circus]], lures many directors, performers, and artists from New York and Los Angeles to work alongside a large local staff at the [[Wells Fargo Pavilion]]. During the fall, winter and spring seasons Broadway Sacramento brings bus and truck tours to the [[Community Center Theater]]. Resident at the [[H Street Theatre Complex]] for the remainder of the year (from September to May), the [[Sacramento Theatre Company]] prepares to celebrate its 75th season, beginning in the Fall of 2019. In addition to a traditional regional theatre fare of classical plays and musicals, the Sacramento Theatre Company has a large School of the Arts with a variety of opportunities for arts education. The [[B Street Theatre]], having completed its 2018 move into the new [[Sophia Tsokopoulos Center for the Arts|Sofia Tsakopoulos Center for the Arts]], continues its pursuit of producing smaller and more intimate professional works for families and children. Rounding out the professional companies is [[Capital Stage]], which performed aboard the Delta King until the end of the 2010\u20132011 season and soon took up residence at its own venue along the J-Street corridor.\n\nThe Sacramento area has one of the largest collection of community theatres in California. Some of these include the Thistle Dew Dessert Theatre and Playwrights Workshop, Davis Musical Theatre Co., El Dorado Musical Theatre, Runaway Stage Productions, River City Theatre Company, Flying Monkey Productions, The Actor's Theatre, KOLT Run Productions, Kookaburra Productions, Big Idea Theatre, Celebration Arts, Lambda Player, Light Opera Theatre of Sacramento, Synergy Stage and the historic Eagle Theatre. The [[Sacramento Shakespeare Festival]] provides entertainment under the stars every summer in William Land Park. Many of these theatres compete annually for the Elly Awards overseen by The Sacramento Area Regional Theatre Alliance or SARTA.\n\n=== Visual arts ===\nThe [[Sacramento Metropolitan Arts Commission]] is an organization that was established as the Sacramento [[arts council]] in 1977 to provide several arts programs for the city. These include Art in Public Places, Arts Education, Grants and Cultural Programs, Poet Laureate Program, Arts Stabilization Programs and Other Resources and opportunities.\n\nSacramento Second Saturday Art Walk is a program of local art galleries that stay open into the late evenings every second Saturday of each month, providing a unique experience for the local population as well as tourists to view original art and meet the artists themselves.\n\n=== Museums ===\n[[File:Crocker Museum in Sacramento Ca..JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.13|The [[Crocker Art Museum]] is the oldest public [[art museum]] in the [[Western United States]] and has one of the premier public art collections in the country.]]\nSacramento has several major museums.

The modern architecture is very different from the museum's original Victorian style building. Construction was completed in 2010.\n\nAlso of interest is the [[Governor's Mansion State Historic Park]], a large Victorian Mansion which was home to 13 of California's Governors, as well as the official residence for former governor [[Jerry Brown]] following renovations in 2015. The [[Leland Stanford Mansion State Historic Park]], which was completely restored in 2006, serves as the State's official address for diplomatic and business receptions. Guided public tours are available. [[The California Museum for History, Women, and the Arts]], home of the [[California Hall of Fame]], is a cultural destination dedicated to telling the rich history of California and its unique influence on the world of ideas, innovation, art and culture. The museum educates tens of thousands of school children through inspiring programs, sharing with world visitors California's rich art, history and cultural legacy through dynamic exhibits, and serving as a public forum and international meeting place.\n\nThe [[California State Railroad Museum]] in Old Sacramento has historical exhibits and live steam locomotives that patrons may ride. The [[California Automobile Museum]], just south of Old Sacramento, is filled with automotive history and vehicles from 1880 to 2006 and is the oldest non-profit automotive museum in the West. The mission of it is to preserve, promote, and teach automotive culture and its influence on our lives\u2014past, present and future. In addition, the [[Sacramento History Museum]], in the heart of Old Sacramento, focuses on the history of Sacramento from the region's pre-Gold Rush history through the present day.\n\nThere is a Museum Day held in Sacramento every year, when 26 museums in the greater Sacramento area offer free admission. The 2009 Sacramento Museum Day brought out more than 80,000 people, the largest number the event has gathered.

Some eventually came to Sacramento, then the second-largest city in California and consequently called \"Yee Fow\" (\"Second City\", Chinese: \u4e8c\u57e0, Jyutping: ''ji<sup>6</sup> fau<sup>6</sup>''). Today the city is known as \u8428\u514b\u62c9\u95e8\u6258 ([[pinyin]]: ''S\u00e0k\u00e8l\u0101m\u00e9ntu\u014d'') by Mainland Chinese and as \u6c99\u52a0\u7dec\u5ea6 (pinyin: ''Sh\u0101ji\u0101mi\u01cendu\u00f3'') by Taiwanese.\n\nSacramento's [[Chinatowns in the United States|Chinatown]] was on \"I\" Street from Second to Sixth Streets. At the time, this area of \"I\" Street was considered a health hazard because, lying within a levee zone, it was lower than other parts of the city, which were situated on higher land. Throughout Sacramento's Chinatown history, there were fires, acts of discrimination, and prejudicial legislation such as the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] that was not repealed until 1943. The mysterious fires were thought to be set off by those who did not take a liking to the Chinese working class.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newsreview.com/sacramento/content?oid=344958 |title=Sacramento's Chinatown \u2013 News \u2013 Local Stories \u2013 June 28, 2007 |work=Sacramento News & Review |date= |access-date=November 16, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009230841/http://www.newsreview.com/sacramento/Content?oid=344958 |archive-date=October 9, 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref> Ordinances on what was viable building material were set into place to try to get the Chinese to move out. Newspapers such as [[The Sacramento Union]] wrote stories at the time that portrayed the Chinese in an unfavorable light to inspire ethnic discrimination and drive the Chinese away. As the years passed, a railroad was created over parts of the Chinatown, and further policies and laws would make it even harder for Chinese workers to sustain a living in Sacramento.\n\nWhile most of Sacramento's Chinatown has now been razed, a small Chinatown mall remains as well as a museum dedicated to the history of Sacramento's Chinatown and the contributions Chinese Americans have made to the city.

''[[The Economist]]'' described effective programming for the Nintendo 64 as being \"horrendously complex\".<ref>\"Nintendo Wakes Up.\" The Economist August 3, 1996: 55-. ABI/INFORM Global; ProQuest Research Library. Web. May 24, 2012.</ref> As with many other game consoles and other types of embedded systems, the Nintendo 64's architectural optimizations are uniquely acute, due to a combination of oversight on the part of the hardware designers, limitations on 3D technology of the time, and manufacturing capabilities.\n\nAs the Nintendo 64 reached the end of its lifecycle, hardware development chief [[Genyo Takeda]] repeatedly referred to the programming challenges using the word ''hansei'' ({{lang-ja|\u53cd\u7701}} \"reflective regret\"). Looking back, Takeda said \"When we made Nintendo 64, we thought it was logical that if you want to make advanced games, it becomes technically more difficult. We were wrong. We now understand it's the cruising speed that matters, not the momentary flash of peak power\".<ref name=\"It's Hip to be Square\">{{cite journal | magazine=Newsweek | title=It's Hip to be Square | last1=Croal | first1=N'Gai | last2=Kawaguchi | first2=Masato | last3=Saltzman | first3=Marc | volume=136 | issue=10 | date=September 3, 2000 | page=53 | url=http://www.newsweek.com/its-hip-be-square-159157 | accessdate=February 7, 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Regional lockout ===\nNintendo initially stated that while the Nintendo 64 units for each region use essentially identical hardware design, [[regional lockout]] chips would prevent games from one region from being played on a Nintendo 64 console from a different region.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=N64 Top 10 List |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |issue=85|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=August 1996 |page=17}}</ref> Following the North American launch, however, they admitted that the cartridges contain no such chips, and the regional lockout is enforced by differing notches in the back of the cartridges.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Launch Puts N64 on Map |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |issue=89|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=December 1996 |pages=20\u201321}}</ref>\n\n== Games ==\n{{See also|List of Nintendo 64 games|Nintendo Selects#Nintendo 64|l2=List of Nintendo 64 Player's Choice games}}\n\nA total of 388 games were released for the console, though there were a few that were exclusively sold in Japan. For comparison, rivals [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] and the [[Sega Saturn]] received around 1,100 games and 600 games respectively, while previous Nintendo consoles such as the  NES and SNES had 768 and 725 games released in the United States.

In order to maximize use of the Nintendo 64 hardware developers had to create their own custom microcode.  Nintendo 64 games running on custom microcode benefited from much higher polygon counts in tandem with more advanced lighting, animation, physics and AI routines than its 32-bit competition. ''Conker's Bad Fur Day'' is arguably the pinnacle of its generation combining multicolored real-time lighting that illuminates each area to real-time shadowing and detailed texturing replete with a full in game facial animation system.  The Nintendo 64's graphics chip is capable of executing many more advanced and complex rendering techniques than its competitors.  It is the first home console to feature [[trilinear filtering]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Nintendo DS vs. Nintendo 64 |url=http://purenintendo.com/2008/12/26/nintendo-ds-vs-nintendo-64so-whats-more-powerful/ |accessdate=January 15, 2009}}</ref> which allowed textures to look very smooth. This contrasted with the [[Sega Saturn|Saturn]] and [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], which used [[nearest-neighbor interpolation]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Saturn Game Tutorial |url=http://www.rockin-b.de/saturn/saturngametutorial/SaturnGameTutorial.htm |accessdate=January 15, 2009}}</ref> and produced more [[Pixelation|pixelated]] textures.  Overall however the results of the Nintendo cartridge system were mixed and this was tied primarily to its storage medium.\n\nThe smaller storage size of ROM cartridges limited the number of available textures. As a result, many games which utilized much smaller 8 or 12&nbsp;MB cartridges are forced to stretch textures over larger surfaces.  Compounded by a limit of 4,096 bytes<ref>{{cite web |title=Nintendo 64 |url=http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?c=1242&st=2 |accessdate=January 15, 2009}}</ref> of on-chip texture memory, the end-result is often a distorted, out-of-proportion appearance. Many titles that feature larger 32 or 64&nbsp;MB cartridges avoided this issue entirely, notable games include ''[[Resident Evil 2]]'', ''[[Sin and Punishment]]: Successor of the Earth'', and ''[[Conker's Bad Fur Day]]'' as they feature more ROM space,<ref name=\"hardware1\" /> allowing for more detailed graphics by utilizing multiple, multi-layered textures across all surfaces.\n\n=== Game Paks ===\n{{Main|Nintendo 64 Game Pak}}\n[[File:N64-Game-Cartridge.jpg|thumb|Open and unopened Nintendo 64 Game Paks]]\n\nNintendo 64 games are [[ROM cartridge]] based.

Its vintage [[ROM cartridge]]s are constrained by small capacity and high production expenses, compared to the [[compact disc]] format used by its chief competitors. Some third-party publishers that supported Nintendo's previous consoles reduced their output or stopped publishing for the console; the Nintendo 64's most successful games came from [[Video game developer|first-party or second-party studios]].\n\n{{further|Nintendo 64 programming characteristics}}\n\n=== Emulation ===\n{{See also|Virtual Console|List of video game emulators#Nintendo 64|label 2=List of Nintendo 64 console emulators}}\n\nSeveral Nintendo 64 games have been released for the [[Wii]]'s and [[Wii U]]'s [[Virtual Console]] service and are playable with the [[Classic Controller]], [[GameCube controller|GameCube controller]], [[Wii U Pro Controller]], or [[Wii U GamePad]]. There are some differences between these versions and the original cartridge versions. For example, the games run in a higher resolution and at a more consistent framerate than their Nintendo 64 counterparts. Some features, such as Rumble Pak functionality, are not available in the Wii versions. Some features are also changed on the Virtual Console releases. For example, the VC version of ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Snap]]'' allows players to send photos through the Wii's message service, while ''[[Wave Race 64]]'''s in-game content was altered due to the expiration of the [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries|Kawasaki]] license. Several games developed by Rare were released on Microsoft's [[Xbox Live Arcade]] service, including ''[[Banjo-Kazooie]]'', ''[[Banjo-Tooie]]'', and ''[[Perfect Dark]]'', following Microsoft's acquisition of Rareware in 2002. One exception is ''[[Donkey Kong 64]]'', released in April 2015 on the Wii U Virtual Console, as Nintendo retained the rights to the game.\n\nSeveral unofficial emulators have been developed in order to play Nintendo 64 games on other platforms, such as [[Personal computer|PCs]], [[Macintosh|Mac]] and cell phones.\n\n== Accessories ==\n{{Main|Nintendo 64 accessories}}\n\nA number of accessories were produced for the Nintendo 64, including the Rumble Pak and the Transfer Pak.\n\nThe controller was shaped like an \"M\", employing a joystick in the center. ''[[Popular Electronics]]'' called its shape \"evocative of some alien space ship\". While noting that the three handles could be confusing, the magazine said \"the separate grips allow different hand positions for various game types\".<ref name=\"Popular Will\" />\n\n=== 64DD ===\n{{Anchor|Disk drive}}\n{{Main|64DD}}\nNintendo released a peripheral platform called [[64DD]], where \"DD\" stands for \"Disk Drive\". Connecting to the expansion slot at the bottom of the system, the 64DD turns the Nintendo 64 console into an Internet appliance, a multimedia workstation, and an expanded gaming platform. This large peripheral allows players to play Nintendo 64 disk-based games, capture images from an external video source, and it allowed players to connect to the now-defunct Japanese [[Randnet]] online service. Not long after its limited mail-order release, the peripheral was discontinued. Only nine games were released, including the four ''[[Mario Artist]]'' games (''Paint Studio'', ''Talent Studio'', ''Communication Kit'', and ''Polygon Studio''). Many more planned games were eventually released in cartridge format or on other game consoles. The 64DD and the accompanying Randnet online service were released only in Japan, though always having been announced for America and Europe.\n\nTo illustrate the fundamental significance of the 64DD to all game development at Nintendo, lead designer [[Shigesato Itoi]] said: \"I came up with a lot of ideas because of the 64DD. All things start with the 64DD. There are so many ideas I wouldn\u2019t have been allowed to come up with if we didn\u2019t have the 64DD\". [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] concluded: \"Almost every new project for the N64 is based on the 64DD. ... we\u2019ll make the game on a cartridge first, then add the technology we\u2019ve cultivated to finish it up as a full-out 64DD game\".<ref name=\"The 64Dream Dec 1997\">{{ cite journal | title=A friendly discussion between the \"Big 2\" | others=[http://yomuka.wordpress.com/2013/03/29/itoi-miyamoto-interview-64dd/ Translation] | magazine=The 64DREAM | subjectlink1=Shigeru Miyamoto | subjectlink2=Shigesato Itoi | first1=Shigeru | last1=Miyamoto | first2=Shigesato | last2=Itoi | date=December 1997 | page=91}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n===Critical reception===\nThe Nintendo 64 received generally positive reviews from critics.

Its form factor was described as small, light, and \"built for heavy play by kids\" unlike the \"relatively fragile Sega Saturn\". Showing concern for a major console product launch during a sharp, several-year long, decline in the game console market, the review said that the long-delayed Nintendo 64 was \"worth the wait\" in the company's pursuit of quality.  Nintendo's \"penchant for perfection\" in game quality control was praised, though with concerns about having only two launch titles at retail and twelve expected by Christmas. Describing the quality control incentives associated with cartridge-based development, the ''Times'' cited Nintendo's position that cartridge game developers tend to \"place a premium on substance over flash\", and noted that the launch titles lack the \"poorly acted live-action sequences or half-baked musical overtures\" which it says tend to be found on CD-ROM games. Praising Nintendo's controversial choice of the cartridge medium with its \"nonexistent\" load times and \"continuous, fast-paced action CD-ROMs simply cannot deliver\", the review concluded that \"the cartridge-based Nintendo 64 delivers blistering speed and tack-sharp graphics that are unheard of on personal computers and make competing 32-bit, disc-based consoles from Sega and Sony seem downright sluggish\".<ref name=\"Curtiss wonder\">{{cite news | last=Curtiss | first=Aaron | title=New Nintendo 64 is a Technical Wonder; Leisure: The Cartridge-Based Game Machine Boasts Blistering Speed and Super-Sharp Graphics | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-09-30/business/fi-49002_1_n64 | newspaper=Los Angeles Times | date=September 30, 1996 | accessdate=January 21, 2015}}</ref>\n\n''Time'' named it their 1996 Machine of the Year, saying the machine had \"done to video-gaming what the [[Boeing 707|707]] did to air travel\".

In order to maximize use of the Nintendo 64 hardware developers had to create their own custom microcode.  Nintendo 64 games running on custom microcode benefited from much higher polygon counts in tandem with more advanced lighting, animation, physics and AI routines than its 32-bit competition. ''Conker's Bad Fur Day'' is arguably the pinnacle of its generation combining multicolored real-time lighting that illuminates each area to real-time shadowing and detailed texturing replete with a full in game facial animation system.  The Nintendo 64's graphics chip is capable of executing many more advanced and complex rendering techniques than its competitors.  It is the first home console to feature [[trilinear filtering]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Nintendo DS vs. Nintendo 64 |url=http://purenintendo.com/2008/12/26/nintendo-ds-vs-nintendo-64so-whats-more-powerful/ |accessdate=January 15, 2009}}</ref> which allowed textures to look very smooth. This contrasted with the [[Sega Saturn|Saturn]] and [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], which used [[nearest-neighbor interpolation]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Saturn Game Tutorial |url=http://www.rockin-b.de/saturn/saturngametutorial/SaturnGameTutorial.htm |accessdate=January 15, 2009}}</ref> and produced more [[Pixelation|pixelated]] textures.  Overall however the results of the Nintendo cartridge system were mixed and this was tied primarily to its storage medium.\n\nThe smaller storage size of ROM cartridges limited the number of available textures. As a result, many games which utilized much smaller 8 or 12&nbsp;MB cartridges are forced to stretch textures over larger surfaces.  Compounded by a limit of 4,096 bytes<ref>{{cite web |title=Nintendo 64 |url=http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?c=1242&st=2 |accessdate=January 15, 2009}}</ref> of on-chip texture memory, the end-result is often a distorted, out-of-proportion appearance. Many titles that feature larger 32 or 64&nbsp;MB cartridges avoided this issue entirely, notable games include ''[[Resident Evil 2]]'', ''[[Sin and Punishment]]: Successor of the Earth'', and ''[[Conker's Bad Fur Day]]'' as they feature more ROM space,<ref name=\"hardware1\" /> allowing for more detailed graphics by utilizing multiple, multi-layered textures across all surfaces.\n\n=== Game Paks ===\n{{Main|Nintendo 64 Game Pak}}\n[[File:N64-Game-Cartridge.jpg|thumb|Open and unopened Nintendo 64 Game Paks]]\n\nNintendo 64 games are [[ROM cartridge]] based.

For example, the VC version of ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Snap]]'' allows players to send photos through the Wii's message service, while ''[[Wave Race 64]]'''s in-game content was altered due to the expiration of the [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries|Kawasaki]] license. Several games developed by Rare were released on Microsoft's [[Xbox Live Arcade]] service, including ''[[Banjo-Kazooie]]'', ''[[Banjo-Tooie]]'', and ''[[Perfect Dark]]'', following Microsoft's acquisition of Rareware in 2002. One exception is ''[[Donkey Kong 64]]'', released in April 2015 on the Wii U Virtual Console, as Nintendo retained the rights to the game.\n\nSeveral unofficial emulators have been developed in order to play Nintendo 64 games on other platforms, such as [[Personal computer|PCs]], [[Macintosh|Mac]] and cell phones.\n\n== Accessories ==\n{{Main|Nintendo 64 accessories}}\n\nA number of accessories were produced for the Nintendo 64, including the Rumble Pak and the Transfer Pak.\n\nThe controller was shaped like an \"M\", employing a joystick in the center. ''[[Popular Electronics]]'' called its shape \"evocative of some alien space ship\". While noting that the three handles could be confusing, the magazine said \"the separate grips allow different hand positions for various game types\".<ref name=\"Popular Will\" />\n\n=== 64DD ===\n{{Anchor|Disk drive}}\n{{Main|64DD}}\nNintendo released a peripheral platform called [[64DD]], where \"DD\" stands for \"Disk Drive\". Connecting to the expansion slot at the bottom of the system, the 64DD turns the Nintendo 64 console into an Internet appliance, a multimedia workstation, and an expanded gaming platform. This large peripheral allows players to play Nintendo 64 disk-based games, capture images from an external video source, and it allowed players to connect to the now-defunct Japanese [[Randnet]] online service. Not long after its limited mail-order release, the peripheral was discontinued. Only nine games were released, including the four ''[[Mario Artist]]'' games (''Paint Studio'', ''Talent Studio'', ''Communication Kit'', and ''Polygon Studio''). Many more planned games were eventually released in cartridge format or on other game consoles. The 64DD and the accompanying Randnet online service were released only in Japan, though always having been announced for America and Europe.\n\nTo illustrate the fundamental significance of the 64DD to all game development at Nintendo, lead designer [[Shigesato Itoi]] said: \"I came up with a lot of ideas because of the 64DD. All things start with the 64DD. There are so many ideas I wouldn\u2019t have been allowed to come up with if we didn\u2019t have the 64DD\". [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] concluded: \"Almost every new project for the N64 is based on the 64DD. ... we\u2019ll make the game on a cartridge first, then add the technology we\u2019ve cultivated to finish it up as a full-out 64DD game\".<ref name=\"The 64Dream Dec 1997\">{{ cite journal | title=A friendly discussion between the \"Big 2\" | others=[http://yomuka.wordpress.com/2013/03/29/itoi-miyamoto-interview-64dd/ Translation] | magazine=The 64DREAM | subjectlink1=Shigeru Miyamoto | subjectlink2=Shigesato Itoi | first1=Shigeru | last1=Miyamoto | first2=Shigesato | last2=Itoi | date=December 1997 | page=91}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n===Critical reception===\nThe Nintendo 64 received generally positive reviews from critics. Reviewers praised the console's advanced 3D graphics and gameplay, while criticizing the lack of games, especially compared to its rival, the PlayStation. On [[G4techTV]]'s ''[[Filter (TV series)|Filter]]'', the Nintendo 64 was voted up to No. 1 by registered users.\n\nIn February 1996, ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' magazine called the Nintendo Ultra 64 the \"best kept secret in videogames\" and the \"world's most powerful game machine\". It called the system's November 24, 1995 unveiling at [[Nintendo Space World|Shoshinkai]] \"the most anticipated videogaming event of the 1990s, possibly of all time\".<ref name=\"NextGen 14\">{{cite journal | magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]] | date=February 1996 | issue=14 | title=Ultra 64: Nintendo's shot at the title | url=https://archive.org/stream/nextgen-issue-014/Next_Generation_Issue_014_February_1996 | accessdate=February 5, 2015}}</ref> Previewing the Nintendo 64 shortly prior to its launch, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine praised the realistic movement and gameplay provided by the combination of fast graphics processing, pressure-sensitive controller, and the ''Super Mario 64'' game.

Its form factor was described as small, light, and \"built for heavy play by kids\" unlike the \"relatively fragile Sega Saturn\". Showing concern for a major console product launch during a sharp, several-year long, decline in the game console market, the review said that the long-delayed Nintendo 64 was \"worth the wait\" in the company's pursuit of quality.  Nintendo's \"penchant for perfection\" in game quality control was praised, though with concerns about having only two launch titles at retail and twelve expected by Christmas. Describing the quality control incentives associated with cartridge-based development, the ''Times'' cited Nintendo's position that cartridge game developers tend to \"place a premium on substance over flash\", and noted that the launch titles lack the \"poorly acted live-action sequences or half-baked musical overtures\" which it says tend to be found on CD-ROM games. Praising Nintendo's controversial choice of the cartridge medium with its \"nonexistent\" load times and \"continuous, fast-paced action CD-ROMs simply cannot deliver\", the review concluded that \"the cartridge-based Nintendo 64 delivers blistering speed and tack-sharp graphics that are unheard of on personal computers and make competing 32-bit, disc-based consoles from Sega and Sony seem downright sluggish\".<ref name=\"Curtiss wonder\">{{cite news | last=Curtiss | first=Aaron | title=New Nintendo 64 is a Technical Wonder; Leisure: The Cartridge-Based Game Machine Boasts Blistering Speed and Super-Sharp Graphics | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-09-30/business/fi-49002_1_n64 | newspaper=Los Angeles Times | date=September 30, 1996 | accessdate=January 21, 2015}}</ref>\n\n''Time'' named it their 1996 Machine of the Year, saying the machine had \"done to video-gaming what the [[Boeing 707|707]] did to air travel\".

''Time'' credited the Nintendo 64 with revitalizing the video game market, \"rescuing this industry from the dustbin of entertainment history\". The magazine suggested that the Nintendo 64 would play a major role in introducing children to digital technology in the final years of the 20th century.

An alliance of [[Oghuz Turks|Oghuz]], [[Kimeks]], and [[Karluks]] was also pressing the Pechenegs, but another group, the [[Samanid]]s, defeated that alliance. Driven further west by the [[Khazars]] and [[Cuman people|Cumans]] by 889, the Pechenegs in turn drove the Magyars west of the [[Dnieper]] River by 892.\n\n[[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] [[Tsar Simeon I]] employed the Pechenegs to help fend off the Magyars. The Pechenegs were so successful that they drove out the Magyars remaining in [[Etelk\u00f6z]] and the [[Pontic steppes]], forcing them westward   towards the [[Pannonian plain]], where they later founded the [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian state]].\n\n=== Late history and decline ===\n\nBy the 9th and 10th centuries, Pechenegs controlled much of the steppes of southeast [[Europe]] and the [[Crimean Peninsula]].  Although an important factor in the region at the time, like most nomadic tribes their concept of statecraft failed to go beyond random attacks on neighbours and spells as mercenaries for other powers.\n\nIn the 9th century the Pechenegs began a period of wars against [[Kievan Rus']]. For more than two centuries they had launched raids into the lands of Rus', which sometimes escalated into full-scale wars (like the 920 war on the Pechenegs by [[Igor of Kiev]], reported in the ''[[Primary Chronicle]]''). The Pecheneg wars against Kievan Rus' caused the Slavs from Walachian territories to gradually migrate north of the Dniestr in the 10th and 11th centuries.<ref>V. Klyuchevsky, The course of the Russian history. v.1: \"Mysl\u02b9.1987, {{ISBN|5-244-00072-1}}</ref>  Rus'/Pecheneg temporary military alliances also occurred however, as during the Byzantine campaign in 943 led by Igor.<ref>[[Ibn Haukal]] describes the Pechenegs as the long-standing allies of the Rus', whom they invariably accompanied during the 10th century [[Caspian expeditions of the Rus|Caspian expeditions]].</ref> In 968 the Pechenegs [[Siege of Kiev (968)|attacked and besieged Kiev]]; some joined the Prince of Kiev, [[Sviatoslav I, Prince of Kiev|Sviatoslav I]], in his Byzantine campaign of 970\u2013971, though eventually they ambushed and killed the Kievan prince in 972.  According to the ''Primary Chronicle'', the Pecheneg [[Khan (title)|Khan]] [[Kurya (khan)|Kurya]] made a [[Chalice (cup)|chalice]] from Sviatoslav's skull, in accordance with the custom of [[steppe]] nomads.  The fortunes of the Rus'-Pecheneg confrontation swung during the reign of [[Vladimir I of Kiev]] (990\u2013995), who founded the town of [[Pereyaslav]] upon the site of his victory over the Pechenegs,<ref>The chronicler explains the town's name, derived from the Slavic word for \"retake\", by the fact that Vladimir \"retook\" the military glory from the Pechenegs.</ref> followed by the defeat of the Pechenegs during the reign of [[Yaroslav I the Wise]] in 1036. Shortly thereafter, other nomadic peoples replaced the weakened Pechenegs in the [[Pontic steppe]]: the [[Cuman people|Cumans]] and the [[Torks]]. According to [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]] (''History of Ukraine-Ruthenia''), after its defeat near Kiev the Pecheneg Horde  moved towards the [[Danube]], crossed the river, and disappeared out of the [[Pontic steppes]].\n[[File:MadridSkylitzesFol173ra.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|The Pechenegs slaughter the \"skyths\" of [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev]].]]\n\nAfter centuries of fighting involving all their neighbours\u2014the Byzantine Empire, [[Bulgaria]], Kievan Rus', Khazaria, and the Magyars\u2014the Pechenegs were annihilated as an independent force  in 1091 at the [[Battle of Levounion]] by a combined Byzantine and Cuman army under Byzantine Emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos]].

The Byzantines defeated the Pechenegs again at the [[Battle of Beroia]] in 1122, on the territory of modern-day Bulgaria. For some time, significant communities of Pechenegs still remained in the Kingdom of Hungary. With time the Balkan Pechenegs lost their national identity and became fully assimilated, mostly with [[Magyars]] and [[Bulgarians]].\n\nIn the 12th century, according to Byzantine historian [[John Kinnamos]], the Pechenegs fought as [[mercenaries]] for the [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine Emperor]] [[Manuel I Komnenos]] in [[Catepanate of Italy|southern Italy]] against the [[Normans|Norman]] [[king of Sicily]], [[William I of Sicily|William the Bad]].<ref>Kinnamos, IV, 4, p. 143</ref> A group of Pechenegs was present at the battle of [[Andria, Italy|Andria]] in 1155.<ref>[[Ferdinand Chalandon|Chalandon]] 1907</ref>\n\nThe Pechenegs were last mentioned in 1168 as members of Turkic tribes known in the chronicles as the \"[[Chorni Klobuky]] (Black Hats)\".<ref>Ivan Katchanovski, Zenon E.

[...] At the time when the Pechenegs were expelled from their country, some of them of their own will and personal decision stayed behind there and united with the so-called Uzes, and even to this day they live among them, and wear such distinguishing marks as separate them off and betray their origin and how it came about that they were split off from their own folk: for their tunics are short, reaching to the knee, and their sleeves are cut off at the shoulder, whereby, you see, they indicate that they have been cut off from their own folk and those of their race.|[[Constantine Porphyrogenitus]]: ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]''<ref>''Constantine Porphyrogenitus: De Administrando Imperio'' (ch. 37), pp. 167., 169.</ref>}}\n\nHowever, it is uncertain whether this groups' formation is connected to the Pechenegs' first or second migration (as it is proposed by Pritsak and Golden, respectively).{{sfn|Golden|2003|p=I.64}}{{sfn|Pritsak|1975|p=214}} According to Mahmud al-Kashgari, one of the \u00dc\u00e7ok clans of the Oghuz Turks{{sfn|Atalay|2006|p=I.57}} was still formed by Pechenegs in the 1060s.{{sfn|Pritsak|1975|p=214}}\n\n=== Alliance with Byzantium ===\n[[File:63-manasses-chronicle.jpg|thumb|Sviatoslav enters Bulgaria with Pecheneg allies,<ref>[[Tania Velmans]] Three Notes On Miniatures In The Chronicle of Manasses Macedonian Studies https://archive.org/details/ProblemsOfByzantineHistoriographyThreeNotesOnMiniaturesInThe</ref> from the Constantine Manasses Chronicle.]]\n\nIn the 9th century, the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] became allied with the Pechenegs, using them to fend off other, more dangerous tribes such as [[Kievan Rus']] and the [[Magyars]] (Hungarians).\n\nThe Uzes, another [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] steppe people, eventually expelled the Pechenegs from their homeland; in the process, they also seized most of their livestock and other goods. An alliance of [[Oghuz Turks|Oghuz]], [[Kimeks]], and [[Karluks]] was also pressing the Pechenegs, but another group, the [[Samanid]]s, defeated that alliance. Driven further west by the [[Khazars]] and [[Cuman people|Cumans]] by 889, the Pechenegs in turn drove the Magyars west of the [[Dnieper]] River by 892.\n\n[[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] [[Tsar Simeon I]] employed the Pechenegs to help fend off the Magyars. The Pechenegs were so successful that they drove out the Magyars remaining in [[Etelk\u00f6z]] and the [[Pontic steppes]], forcing them westward   towards the [[Pannonian plain]], where they later founded the [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian state]].\n\n=== Late history and decline ===\n\nBy the 9th and 10th centuries, Pechenegs controlled much of the steppes of southeast [[Europe]] and the [[Crimean Peninsula]].  Although an important factor in the region at the time, like most nomadic tribes their concept of statecraft failed to go beyond random attacks on neighbours and spells as mercenaries for other powers.\n\nIn the 9th century the Pechenegs began a period of wars against [[Kievan Rus']]. For more than two centuries they had launched raids into the lands of Rus', which sometimes escalated into full-scale wars (like the 920 war on the Pechenegs by [[Igor of Kiev]], reported in the ''[[Primary Chronicle]]''). The Pecheneg wars against Kievan Rus' caused the Slavs from Walachian territories to gradually migrate north of the Dniestr in the 10th and 11th centuries.<ref>V. Klyuchevsky, The course of the Russian history. v.1: \"Mysl\u02b9.1987, {{ISBN|5-244-00072-1}}</ref>  Rus'/Pecheneg temporary military alliances also occurred however, as during the Byzantine campaign in 943 led by Igor.<ref>[[Ibn Haukal]] describes the Pechenegs as the long-standing allies of the Rus', whom they invariably accompanied during the 10th century [[Caspian expeditions of the Rus|Caspian expeditions]].</ref> In 968 the Pechenegs [[Siege of Kiev (968)|attacked and besieged Kiev]]; some joined the Prince of Kiev, [[Sviatoslav I, Prince of Kiev|Sviatoslav I]], in his Byzantine campaign of 970\u2013971, though eventually they ambushed and killed the Kievan prince in 972.  According to the ''Primary Chronicle'', the Pecheneg [[Khan (title)|Khan]] [[Kurya (khan)|Kurya]] made a [[Chalice (cup)|chalice]] from Sviatoslav's skull, in accordance with the custom of [[steppe]] nomads.  The fortunes of the Rus'-Pecheneg confrontation swung during the reign of [[Vladimir I of Kiev]] (990\u2013995), who founded the town of [[Pereyaslav]] upon the site of his victory over the Pechenegs,<ref>The chronicler explains the town's name, derived from the Slavic word for \"retake\", by the fact that Vladimir \"retook\" the military glory from the Pechenegs.</ref> followed by the defeat of the Pechenegs during the reign of [[Yaroslav I the Wise]] in 1036. Shortly thereafter, other nomadic peoples replaced the weakened Pechenegs in the [[Pontic steppe]]: the [[Cuman people|Cumans]] and the [[Torks]]. According to [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]] (''History of Ukraine-Ruthenia''), after its defeat near Kiev the Pecheneg Horde  moved towards the [[Danube]], crossed the river, and disappeared out of the [[Pontic steppes]].\n[[File:MadridSkylitzesFol173ra.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|The Pechenegs slaughter the \"skyths\" of [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev]].]]\n\nAfter centuries of fighting involving all their neighbours\u2014the Byzantine Empire, [[Bulgaria]], Kievan Rus', Khazaria, and the Magyars\u2014the Pechenegs were annihilated as an independent force  in 1091 at the [[Battle of Levounion]] by a combined Byzantine and Cuman army under Byzantine Emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos]]. Alexios I recruited the defeated Pechenegs, whom he settled in the district of [[Moglena]] (today in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]) into a [[Tagma (military)|tagma]] \"of the Moglena Pechenegs\".<ref>Haldon, John, ''Warfare, State And Society In The Byzantine World 560-1204'', Routledge, 2002, p. 117.</ref> Attacked again in 1094 by the Cumans, many Pechenegs were slain or absorbed. The Byzantines defeated the Pechenegs again at the [[Battle of Beroia]] in 1122, on the territory of modern-day Bulgaria. For some time, significant communities of Pechenegs still remained in the Kingdom of Hungary. With time the Balkan Pechenegs lost their national identity and became fully assimilated, mostly with [[Magyars]] and [[Bulgarians]].\n\nIn the 12th century, according to Byzantine historian [[John Kinnamos]], the Pechenegs fought as [[mercenaries]] for the [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine Emperor]] [[Manuel I Komnenos]] in [[Catepanate of Italy|southern Italy]] against the [[Normans|Norman]] [[king of Sicily]], [[William I of Sicily|William the Bad]].<ref>Kinnamos, IV, 4, p. 143</ref> A group of Pechenegs was present at the battle of [[Andria, Italy|Andria]] in 1155.<ref>[[Ferdinand Chalandon|Chalandon]] 1907</ref>\n\nThe Pechenegs were last mentioned in 1168 as members of Turkic tribes known in the chronicles as the \"[[Chorni Klobuky]] (Black Hats)\".<ref>Ivan Katchanovski, Zenon E. Kohut, Bohdan Y. Nebesio, Myroslav Yurkevich, ''Historical Dictionary of Ukraine'', Scarecrow Press, 2013, p. 439.</ref>\n\nIn 15th-century Hungary, some people adopted the surname ''Beseny\u00f6'' ([[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] for \"Pecheneg\"); they were most numerous in the [[county of Tolna]]. One of the earliest introductions of [[Islam]] into [[Eastern Europe]] came about through the work of an early 11th-century Muslim prisoner who was captured by the Byzantines.  The Muslim prisoner was brought into the [[Bosnia (region)|Beseny\u00f6]] territory of the Pechenegs, where he taught and converted individuals to Islam.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/preachingislama00arnogoog <!-- quote=thomas walker arnold preaching. --> The preaching of Islam: a history of the propagation of the Muslim faith By Sir Thomas Walker Arnold, pg. 335]</ref> In the late 12th century, [[Abu Hamid al Garnathi]] referred to Hungarian Pechenegs \u2013 probably Muslims \u2013 living disguised as Christians.
