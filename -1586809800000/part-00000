Hansen''''' (born March 12, 1954) is an American [[novelist]] and [[professor]] from [[Wisconsin]], now living in [[Stillwater, Minnesota]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nHansen was born in [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]] and lived in [[Illinois]] from the age of 10 to 25. He earned a BA in Political Science (with a minor in English and Anthropology) in 1976, and an MA in English in 1980; both from the University of Illinois. In 1993 he completed a [[Ph.D]] in English at the University of Minnesota with a focus on [[Technical Communication]]. During the years between his MA and Ph.D, he worked in the computer industry in a variety of technical and managerial positions.\n\n===Career===\nHansen has published several academic articles and a few short stories, but ''The Skeleton Train'' is his first novel. Published in 2010 by [[Sky Blue Waters Press]], ''The Skeleton Train'' tells the story of Jason Audley; what many have referred to as a modern-day [[Huckleberry Finn]]. Jason narrates a story that begins when he is fourteen in an industrial Illinois town. The story includes his closest friend, Davey, and a young woman they encounter while hopping [[Rail freight transport|freight trains]] called The Pheadra.<ref name=\"Sky\">\n{{cite web\n |url        =http://www.skybluewaterspress.com/skeleton-train/\n |title        =Skeleton Train\n |last        =Sky Blue Waters Press\n |website        =skybluewaterspress.com\n |accessdate        =July 18, 2013\n |url-status        =dead\n |archiveurl        =https://web.archive.org/web/20131101071202/http://www.skybluewaterspress.com/skeleton-train/\n |archivedate        =November 1, 2013\n }}</ref>\n\nHansen's second novel, ''Winter Lake'', published in 2012, is a sequel to ''The Skeleton Train'' and picks up Jason's life in northern Wisconsin seven years later. He continues to narrate the story as a drummer in a band with his trademark wit and wry sense of humor.<ref name=\"WL-Cover\">\n{{cite book\n | last1 = Hansen, Craig J.\n | title = Winter Lake\n | location = Minnesota\n | publisher = [[Sky Blue Waters Press]]\n | date = October 2010\n | pages = Backcover\n \n | isbn = 9781609104757\n }}</ref>\n\nHansen's third novel, ''The Morning Door'', published in 2014, is the third in the Jason Audley series, and continues Jason's story as an adult in Northwest Wisconsin.<ref name=\"MD-Cover\">\n{{cite book\n | last1 = Hansen, Craig J.\n | title = The Morning Door\n | location = Minnesota\n | publisher = [[Sky Blue Waters Press]]\n | date = November 2014\n | pages = Backcover\n | isbn = 978-1634900294\n }}</ref>\n\nHansen is also the co-author of ''Nonacademic Writing: Social Theory and Technology'', published in 1995 by [[Lawrence Erlbaum]].<ref name=\"Academic\">\n{{cite book\n | last1 = Hansen | first1 = Craig J.\n | first2 = Hill Duin | last2 = Ann\n | title = Nonacademic Writing: Social Theory and Technology\n | publisher = [[Lawrence Erlbaum]]\n | date = November 1995\n | isbn = 0805816283\n }}</ref>\n\n===Personal life===\nHansen lives in Stillwater, Minnesota with his wife, Karen.

He earned a BA in Political Science (with a minor in English and Anthropology) in 1976, and an MA in English in 1980; both from the University of Illinois.
