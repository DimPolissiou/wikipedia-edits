To develop ideas \u2013but, unluckily, the budgets were limited and I was afraid I could reach the plateau. One evening, while I was hanging out with my friends in a restaurant garden in Piata Mica in Sibiu, I imagined how beautiful it would be to have a catwalk there.

He spent his childhood in [[Apoldu de Jos]], a small village 40&nbsp;km away from Sibiu. Spending 14 years there and most of the holidays during the high school Mitichi was working the land with his family but also he was supported to develop his talents in music and painting.

Due to his activity for the advertising agency Mitichi was named Marketing director of Pan Food, a small chocolate factory in Sibiu and he started to study [[Marketing]]\nat [[ROGER University]]  Mitichi remembers those years: \"After a childhood in the communist era where my only worry was to explore the hills and the trenches in my village, I went to Sibiu, studied and let my imagination go wild. I entered new worlds, continued to explore and find myself in a rich environment, full of new possibilities.\".<ref>https://www.casino-magazine.ro/en/mitichi-brings-feeric-fashion-days-into-our-homes.html</ref>\n\nAfter he graduated the first university for his parents wish he went back to Apoldu de Jos to teach the villagers children in primary school and kindergarten.

He founded [[Feeric Fashion Week]] on the 2008's summer \"I was doing fashion shows for the downtown mall and thought of doing something more. To develop ideas \u2013but, unluckily, the budgets were limited and I was afraid I could reach the plateau. One evening, while I was hanging out with my friends in a restaurant garden in Piata Mica in Sibiu, I imagined how beautiful it would be to have a catwalk there. It would be original and spectacular to have the entire show under the lights of the square, under the sky \u2013 the whole thing could only be Feeric (fairy-like, n.tr.)\"<ref>https://www.casino-magazine.ro/en/mitichi-brings-feeric-fashion-days-into-our-homes.html</ref> and launched the first edition of [[M calendar]] being inspired by [[Pirelli Calendar]]\n\n==Feeric Fashion Week==\n[[Feeric Fashion Week]]  has since 2008 developed itself in an international fashion hub for designers coming from more than 20 countries and 4 continents.

On 22 April 1945, [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] troops occupied the airfield as part of the [[Battle of Berlin]]. In 1946, the headquarters of the [[Soviet Air Forces]] moved to Sch\u00f6nefeld from [[Johannisthal Air Field]].\n\nDuring the following years Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport became the most important civilian airport in the newly-founded German Democratic Republic ([[East Germany]]), with national flag carrier [[Interflug]] based there. In 1976, the modern passenger terminal, currently known as Terminal A, opened.\n\n===Plans for a new Berlin Airport===\n[[File:Map Berlin-Schoenefeld Airport SFX with planed BBI.png|thumb|Map showing the infrastructure of the Sch\u00f6nefeld area and the relationship between the new and old airports]]\n\nAfter the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1989, and following [[German reunification]] in 1990, Berlin once again became the German federal capital; leaders made plans to recognize the city's increased importance by constructing a large commercial airport. Existing airports [[Berlin Tegel Airport|Tegel Airport]], [[Berlin Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport|Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport]] and [[Berlin Tempelhof Airport|Tempelhof Airport]] were aging and becoming increasingly congested due to rising passenger numbers. To ensure the economic viability of the project, they pursued the ''single airport concept'', meaning that the new airport would become the sole commercial airport for Berlin and Brandenburg. They planned to close Tegel, Sch\u00f6nefeld and Tempelhof upon opening the new airport, then ban commercial aviation from any other airport in Brandenburg.\n\nOn 2 May 1991, the ''[[Flughafen Berlin Brandenburg GmbH|Berlin Brandenburg Flughafen Holding GmbH]]'' (BBF) was founded, owned by the states of Berlin and Brandenburg (37 percent each) and the Federal Republic of Germany (the remaining 26 percent). [[Eberhard Diepgen]], Mayor of Berlin, became the first chairman of the supervisory board.  The holding company announced on 20 June 1993 that [[Sperenberg Airfield]], [[J\u00fcterbog Airfield]] and the area south of Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport, where the evaluation of the locations Sperenberg, J\u00fcterbog East, J\u00fcterbog West, Tietzow, Michelsdorf, Borkheide and Sch\u00f6nefeld South was carried out according to 5 criteria with different weighting.

They called for proposals, which led to two bidding consortia emerging as serious contenders. One was led by [[Hochtief]] through its [[Hochtief Airport]] subsidiary and included [[ABB Group|ABB]], [[Fraport]] and [[Landesbank Berlin Holding|Bankengesellschaft Berlin]] as partners.  The other consortium comprised [[IVG Immobilien|IVG]], [[Vienna Airport|Flughafen Wien AG]], Dorsch-Consult, [[Commerzbank]] and [[Caisse des d\u00e9p\u00f4ts et consignations|Caisse des D\u00e9p\u00f4ts]]. On 19 September 1998, BBF announced that the Hochtief consortium were the successful bidder.

Inspectors have uncovered many examples of poor workmanship due to a lack of proper supervision and documentation, most notably concerning the wiring. Reports have surfaced about cable conduits that hold too many cables or hold cables in incompatible combinations, such as phone lines next to high voltage wires. A total of {{convert|60|km|mi}} of cooling pipes were allegedly installed with no thermal insulation. To correct this, the demolition of numerous walls may be necessary.

The underground railway station needs a redesign for the underground part of the fire exhaustion system. Incoming or departing trains may suck smoke into the station. As such, air flow guidance is needed to avoid this effect. However, the airport cannot decide upon the method by itself, as permission is needed from the [[Federal Railway Authority]] (''Eisenbahnbundesamt''). The construction authority of the district of [[Dahme-Spreewald]], Eisenbahnbundesamt and the airport thus need to take part in the redesign effort. The plans on how to rebuild the underground part would not be finished before June. Thus, with no plans, the district could not grant the redesign permission. As such, the airport could not start the redesign effort before the beginning of July (assuming that the district would promptly check on the plans). As such, the construction process was delayed by at least 8 months.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/flughafen-berlin-brandenburg-ber-liegt-acht-monate-hinter-dem-zeitplan/13423488.html |date=9 April 2016 |title=BER liegt acht Monate hinter dem Zeitplan |trans-title=BER is 8 months behind schedule |work=Tagesspiegel}}</ref>\n\nOn 17 April 2016, it became clear that the district would check on the plans intensively.

Planners anticipate that a significant number of passengers will use the more than 100 self check-in machines that will be installed. Additionally, by May 2015 two extensions had been added to both sides of the main check-in area containing 12 more check-in counters and eight security lanes each to avoid overcrowding of the main hall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airliners.de/pavillons-hauptstadtflughafen-ber/35849 |title=Pavillons am neuen Hauptstadtflughafen BER sind fertig |publisher=airliners.de |accessdate=17 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe airside area will be accessible only to ticketed and [[Airport security|screened]] passengers.

The boarding and arrival areas are divided into three piers with the main pier {{convert|715|m|ft|sigfig=3}} long and the north and south piers at {{convert|350|m|ft|sigfig=3}} each. The main pier contains 16 jet-bridges, all but one have two levels, thus separating arriving and departing passengers. Level 1 is intended for [[Schengen Area|Schengen passengers]] (gates A01\u2013A20, B01\u2013B20), while Level 2 (gates C01\u2013C19, D01\u2013D17) is for non-Schengen passengers.<ref name=presskit/>{{rp|8\u201310}}  Eight of the gates can accommodate [[wide-body aircraft]] and one gate has been designed to accommodate the [[Airbus A380]]. The apron has sufficient space to allow installation of a dual jetway allowing a quick boarding and disembarking process. A mezzanine (Level Z) at gates A21\u201322 and B21 allows for additional pre-boarding security checks for high-risk flights to the [[United States]] and [[Israel]].

However, so far there are no definite plans for the future use of this area.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n==Controversies==\nIn September 2010 [[Deutsche Flugsicherung]] published aircraft arrival and departure paths for Berlin Brandenburg Airport which significantly differ from earlier ones used in the court decision for the construction permit. In the original maps, aircraft were expected to take off and land in a path parallel with the runway. The new plans saw flight paths that deviate from the runway direction by 15 degrees. Therefore, aircraft would now fly over areas in southern Berlin ([[Lichtenrade]], [[Steglitz]] and [[Zehlendorf, Berlin|Zehlendorf]]) and adjacent Brandenburg ([[Teltow]], [[Stahnsdorf]], [[Kleinmachnow]] and [[Potsdam]]) to the surprise of local residents. This prompted a wave of protests and a lawsuit that the courts rejected.<ref name=warner>{{cite news| url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/a-749894.html| work=Der Spiegel| title=Resistance Builds to Planned Flight Paths at New Berlin Airport| date=3 November 2011| first=Mary Beth| last=Warner}}</ref>\n\nBoth the expansion of Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport into BER and the quality of the connection to the railway network are the subject of public debate. The ''B\u00fcrgerverein Brandenburg-Berlin e.V.'' represents local residents who protest an expansion of air traffic to and from the south of Berlin. Also, traffic and environmental experts criticise the late completion dates for the fast connection to the [[Berlin Hauptbahnhof]]. Still, Berlin Hauptbahnhof will be only a 30-minute journey with trains departing every 15 minutes upon inauguration. At the time of the originally planned opening date of BER, in 2011, this was expected to be reduced to 20 minutes after reconstruction of the Berlin section of the [[Berlin\u2013Dresden railway]], which was planned to be finished by 2020.<ref name=dresdnerbahn>{{cite news| title=Reisezeitverl\u00e4ngerungen f\u00fcr Airport-Express-Reisende| url=http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/newsticker/reisezeitverlaengerungen-fuer-airport-express-reisende,10917074,10928694.html| work=Berliner Zeitung| date=26 August 2011| trans-title=Longer travel times for Airport Express travelers| language=German}}</ref> However, delays in both the BER construction and the construction of the railway meant that the travel time will be more than 50 minutes until at least 2025.

On 22 April 1945, [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] troops occupied the airfield as part of the [[Battle of Berlin]]. In 1946, the headquarters of the [[Soviet Air Forces]] moved to Sch\u00f6nefeld from [[Johannisthal Air Field]].\n\nDuring the following years Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport became the most important civilian airport in the newly-founded German Democratic Republic ([[East Germany]]), with national flag carrier [[Interflug]] based there. In 1976, the modern passenger terminal, currently known as Terminal A, opened.\n\n===Plans for a new Berlin Airport===\n[[File:Map Berlin-Schoenefeld Airport SFX with planed BBI.png|thumb|Map showing the infrastructure of the Sch\u00f6nefeld area and the relationship between the new and old airports]]\n\nAfter the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1989, and following [[German reunification]] in 1990, Berlin once again became the German federal capital; leaders made plans to recognize the city's increased importance by constructing a large commercial airport. Existing airports [[Berlin Tegel Airport|Tegel Airport]], [[Berlin Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport|Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport]] and [[Berlin Tempelhof Airport|Tempelhof Airport]] were aging and becoming increasingly congested due to rising passenger numbers. To ensure the economic viability of the project, they pursued the ''single airport concept'', meaning that the new airport would become the sole commercial airport for Berlin and Brandenburg. They planned to close Tegel, Sch\u00f6nefeld and Tempelhof upon opening the new airport, then ban commercial aviation from any other airport in Brandenburg.\n\nOn 2 May 1991, the ''[[Flughafen Berlin Brandenburg GmbH|Berlin Brandenburg Flughafen Holding GmbH]]'' (BBF) was founded, owned by the states of Berlin and Brandenburg (37 percent each) and the Federal Republic of Germany (the remaining 26 percent). [[Eberhard Diepgen]], Mayor of Berlin, became the first chairman of the supervisory board.  The holding company announced on 20 June 1993 that [[Sperenberg Airfield]], [[J\u00fcterbog Airfield]] and the area south of Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport, where the evaluation of the locations Sperenberg, J\u00fcterbog East, J\u00fcterbog West, Tietzow, Michelsdorf, Borkheide and Sch\u00f6nefeld South was carried out according to 5 criteria with different weighting.

They called for proposals, which led to two bidding consortia emerging as serious contenders. One was led by [[Hochtief]] through its [[Hochtief Airport]] subsidiary and included [[ABB Group|ABB]], [[Fraport]] and [[Landesbank Berlin Holding|Bankengesellschaft Berlin]] as partners.  The other consortium comprised [[IVG Immobilien|IVG]], [[Vienna Airport|Flughafen Wien AG]], Dorsch-Consult, [[Commerzbank]] and [[Caisse des d\u00e9p\u00f4ts et consignations|Caisse des D\u00e9p\u00f4ts]]. On 19 September 1998, BBF announced that the Hochtief consortium were the successful bidder.

Inspectors have uncovered many examples of poor workmanship due to a lack of proper supervision and documentation, most notably concerning the wiring. Reports have surfaced about cable conduits that hold too many cables or hold cables in incompatible combinations, such as phone lines next to high voltage wires. A total of {{convert|60|km|mi}} of cooling pipes were allegedly installed with no thermal insulation. To correct this, the demolition of numerous walls may be necessary. Furthermore, exterior vents appear to be in improper locations, allowing rainwater from the western facade to enter them.<ref name=\"failures\" /> The {{convert|18|km|mi|abbr=on}} long exhaust system to remove smoke from a fire is leaking.<ref name=\"leaking\">{{cite news| url=https://de.nachrichten.yahoo.com/zeitung-brandschutzanlage-am-ber-undicht-091259096.html |title=Zeitung: Brandschutzanlage am BER undicht| date=18 May 2014| work=Yahoo!

The underground railway station needs a redesign for the underground part of the fire exhaustion system. Incoming or departing trains may suck smoke into the station. As such, air flow guidance is needed to avoid this effect. However, the airport cannot decide upon the method by itself, as permission is needed from the [[Federal Railway Authority]] (''Eisenbahnbundesamt''). The construction authority of the district of [[Dahme-Spreewald]], Eisenbahnbundesamt and the airport thus need to take part in the redesign effort. The plans on how to rebuild the underground part would not be finished before June. Thus, with no plans, the district could not grant the redesign permission. As such, the airport could not start the redesign effort before the beginning of July (assuming that the district would promptly check on the plans). As such, the construction process was delayed by at least 8 months.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/flughafen-berlin-brandenburg-ber-liegt-acht-monate-hinter-dem-zeitplan/13423488.html |date=9 April 2016 |title=BER liegt acht Monate hinter dem Zeitplan |trans-title=BER is 8 months behind schedule |work=Tagesspiegel}}</ref>\n\nOn 17 April 2016, it became clear that the district would check on the plans intensively.

They are the same company which designed the hexagonal Terminal A at Tegel Airport which opened in 1974.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} At BER the terminal sits between the two runways, creating a so-called ''midfield airport'' above the underground train station. The terminal has four public levels designated 0, 1, 2 and 3.\n\nThe [[Airport check-in|check-in area]] is located in the public area at Level 1 and houses 118 counters organised in eight clusters, called ''check-in isles''. Planners anticipate that a significant number of passengers will use the more than 100 self check-in machines that will be installed. Additionally, by May 2015 two extensions had been added to both sides of the main check-in area containing 12 more check-in counters and eight security lanes each to avoid overcrowding of the main hall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airliners.de/pavillons-hauptstadtflughafen-ber/35849 |title=Pavillons am neuen Hauptstadtflughafen BER sind fertig |publisher=airliners.de |accessdate=17 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe airside area will be accessible only to ticketed and [[Airport security|screened]] passengers. [[Securitas (Swedish security company)|Securitas Germany]] will staff the 35 screening stations. BER is equipped with 25 [[jet bridge]]s with another 85 aircraft stands on the apron. The boarding and arrival areas are divided into three piers with the main pier {{convert|715|m|ft|sigfig=3}} long and the north and south piers at {{convert|350|m|ft|sigfig=3}} each. The main pier contains 16 jet-bridges, all but one have two levels, thus separating arriving and departing passengers. Level 1 is intended for [[Schengen Area|Schengen passengers]] (gates A01\u2013A20, B01\u2013B20), while Level 2 (gates C01\u2013C19, D01\u2013D17) is for non-Schengen passengers.<ref name=presskit/>{{rp|8\u201310}}  Eight of the gates can accommodate [[wide-body aircraft]] and one gate has been designed to accommodate the [[Airbus A380]]. The apron has sufficient space to allow installation of a dual jetway allowing a quick boarding and disembarking process. A mezzanine (Level Z) at gates A21\u201322 and B21 allows for additional pre-boarding security checks for high-risk flights to the [[United States]] and [[Israel]]. Lufthansa and [[Air France]]/[[KLM]] will operate [[airport lounge]]s in the main pier which will also be open for passengers of the respective [[airline alliance|alliance partners]].<ref name=\"Handbuch\">{{cite book|url=http://www.berlin-airport.de/DE/GeschaeftskundenUndPartner/Touristik/Handbuch_Flughafen_Berlin_Brandenburg_deutsch.pdf |title=Flughafen Berlin Brandenburg Handbuch |publisher=Berliner Flughafen-Gesellschaft mbH |accessdate=6 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417010130/http://www.berlin-airport.de/DE/GeschaeftskundenUndPartner/Touristik/Handbuch_Flughafen_Berlin_Brandenburg_deutsch.pdf |archivedate=17 April 2012 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:120513-BER-innen.JPG|thumb|The main hall of the terminal]]\nThe south pier was reserved for near-exclusive use of defunct [[Air Berlin]] and its [[Oneworld]] partners.

The [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 96|highway 96a]] along the north side of the airport is being expanded to four lanes towards [[Potsdam]].\n\nFour car parks and a car rental centre will be completed by the opening of BER. Around 10,000 parking spaces will be available in four [[multi-storey car park]]s.\n\nA study released in September 2016 attested that BER will double the amount of vehicular traffic, causing frequent traffic jams on the [[Autobahn]] once the airport opens. The A100 and A113 do not have enough lanes to support the expected volume of traffic. The approach to BER was deemed insufficient for the expected traffic and will lead to heavy congestion on the highways throughout south-central Berlin.

A further ''Business Park North'' was proposed as a future use of the area of the old Sch\u00f6nefeld terminal. However, so far there are no definite plans for the future use of this area.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n==Controversies==\nIn September 2010 [[Deutsche Flugsicherung]] published aircraft arrival and departure paths for Berlin Brandenburg Airport which significantly differ from earlier ones used in the court decision for the construction permit. In the original maps, aircraft were expected to take off and land in a path parallel with the runway. The new plans saw flight paths that deviate from the runway direction by 15 degrees. Therefore, aircraft would now fly over areas in southern Berlin ([[Lichtenrade]], [[Steglitz]] and [[Zehlendorf, Berlin|Zehlendorf]]) and adjacent Brandenburg ([[Teltow]], [[Stahnsdorf]], [[Kleinmachnow]] and [[Potsdam]]) to the surprise of local residents.

The ''B\u00fcrgerverein Brandenburg-Berlin e.V.'' represents local residents who protest an expansion of air traffic to and from the south of Berlin. Also, traffic and environmental experts criticise the late completion dates for the fast connection to the [[Berlin Hauptbahnhof]]. Still, Berlin Hauptbahnhof will be only a 30-minute journey with trains departing every 15 minutes upon inauguration. At the time of the originally planned opening date of BER, in 2011, this was expected to be reduced to 20 minutes after reconstruction of the Berlin section of the [[Berlin\u2013Dresden railway]], which was planned to be finished by 2020.<ref name=dresdnerbahn>{{cite news| title=Reisezeitverl\u00e4ngerungen f\u00fcr Airport-Express-Reisende| url=http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/newsticker/reisezeitverlaengerungen-fuer-airport-express-reisende,10917074,10928694.html| work=Berliner Zeitung| date=26 August 2011| trans-title=Longer travel times for Airport Express travelers| language=German}}</ref> However, delays in both the BER construction and the construction of the railway meant that the travel time will be more than 50 minutes until at least 2025.

To achieve this, the organisation offers a range of direct services. Accommodation is provided, or repair/refurbishment of their existing home if living conditions simply aren't suitable. Out-of-school tuition is provided to help children study. Books and stationery are given to those who can't afford them, and scholarships are provided both for children and tertiary students. Medical care and nutritional support are provided to those who need it. \n\nChild trafficking is a major issue in SE Asia, and Blue Dragon tackles this both within Vietnam and internationally. From 2005 to January 2016, Blue Dragon rescued over 500 children and young adults from forced labour, forced marriages, and brothels.\n\nBlue Dragon operates a drop-in centre for street children in Hanoi, where they can play, shower, study and take part in social activities.\n\nIn addition to these direct services, Blue Dragon staff offer training opportunities to government officials on issues such as human trafficking and child abuse; and work with legislators to revise and improve the country's legal framework for children.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Child poverty]]\n* [[List of non-governmental organizations in Vietnam]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Sex trafficking in Southeast Asia|state=collapsed}}\n\n==External links==\n===Blue Dragon links===\n* [http://www.bluedragon.org/ BDCF official page]\n* [http://vietnamstreets.blogspot.com/ Street kids in Vietnam - BDCF blog]\n* [https://www.facebook.com/bluedragonvietnam/ Blue Dragon's Facebook page]\n* [https://twitter.com/BlueDragonVN Blue Dragon on Twitter]\n\n===Resources and materials===\n*[http://www.travelfish.org/beginners_detail/vietnam/140 Travelfish article]\n*[http://www.brandeis.edu/magazine/2014/winter/featured-stories/van_ta.html Brandeis University article about Blue Dragon's rescue work]\n*[http://phys.org/news/2014-06-child-workers-vietnam-exploitation.html Child Labour in Vietnam]\n*[http://latitude.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/01/vietnams-trade-of-underaged-species/ New York Times article on child trafficking]\n*[http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2015/03/31/4207346.htm 2015 Richard Fidler Conversations interview with Michael Brosowski] \n\n[[Category:Organizations established in 2004]]\n\n[[Category:Children's charities based in Australia]]\n<!-- registered there -->\n\n[[Category:Foreign charities operating in Vietnam]]\n<!-- physical base there -->\n[[Category:Child education organizations]]\n[[Category:Foundations based in Australia]]\n[[Category:Non-profit organisations based in New South Wales]]\n", "text_old": "{{Tone|date=June 2010}}\n\n{{Infobox organization\n| name                = Blue Dragon Children's Foundation\n| native_name         = \n| native_name_lang    = \n| named_after         = \n| image               = Blue_Dragon_Children's_Foundation_logo_2016.png\n| image_size          = 190px\n| alt                 = \n| caption             = \n| logo                =\n| logo_size           = \n| logo_alt            = \n| logo_caption        = \n| map                 = \n| map_size            = \n| map_alt             = \n| map_caption         = \n| map2                = \n| map2_size           = \n| map2_alt            = \n| map2_caption        = \n| abbreviation        = \n| motto               = \n| predecessor         = \n| merged              = \n| successor           = \n| formation           = September 2004\n| founder             = [[Michael Brosowski]] \n| founding_location   = [[Hanoi]], Vietnam\n| extinction          = <!-- use {{end date and age|YYYY|MM|DD}} -->\n| merger              = \n| type                = NPO\n| tax_id              = <!-- or | vat_id = (for European organizations) -->\n| registration_id     = <!-- for non-profit org -->\n| status              = \n| purpose             = \n| headquarters        = \n| location            = \n| coords              = <!-- {{coord|LAT|LON|display=inline, title}} -->\n| region              = \n| services            = \n| products            = \n| methods             = \n| fields              = \n| membership          = \n| membership_year     = \n| language            = \n| owner               = \n| sec_gen             = \n| leader_title        = \n| leader_name         = \n| leader_title2       = \n| leader_name2        = \n| leader_title3       = \n| leader_name3        = \n| leader_title4       = \n| leader_name4        = \n| board_of_directors  = \n| key_people          = \n| main_organ          = \n| parent_organization = \n| subsidiaries        = \n| secessions          = \n| affiliations        = \n| budget              = \n| budget_year         = \n| revenue             = \n| revenue_year        = \n| disbursements       = \n| expenses            = \n| expenses_year       = \n| endowment           = \n| staff               = \n| staff_year          = \n| volunteers          = \n| volunteers_year     = \n| slogan              = \n| mission             = \n| website             = https://www.bluedragon.org/\n| remarks             = \n| formerly            = \n| footnotes           = \n}}\n\n'''Blue Dragon Children's Foundation''' (Blue Dragon) is a charitably funded [[non-governmental organization]] based in [[Hanoi]], [[Vietnam]].

To achieve this, the organisation offers a range of direct services. Accommodation is provided, or repair/refurbishment of their existing home if living conditions simply aren't suitable. Out-of-school tuition is provided to help children study. Books and stationery are given to those who can't afford them, and scholarships are provided both for children and tertiary students. Medical care and nutritional support are provided to those who need it. \n\nChild trafficking is a major issue in SE Asia, and Blue Dragon tackles this both within Vietnam and internationally. From 2005 to January 2016, Blue Dragon rescued over 500 children and young adults from forced labour, forced marriages, and brothels.\n\nBlue Dragon operates a drop-in centre for street children in Hanoi, where they can play, shower, study and take part in social activities.\n\nIn addition to these direct services, Blue Dragon staff offer training opportunities to government officials on issues such as human trafficking and child abuse; and work with legislators to revise and improve the country's legal framework for children.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Child poverty]]\n* [[List of non-governmental organizations in Vietnam]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Sex trafficking in Southeast Asia|state=collapsed}}\n\n==External links==\n===Blue Dragon links===\n* [http://www.bluedragon.org/ BDCF official page]\n* [http://vietnamstreets.blogspot.com/ Street kids in Vietnam - BDCF blog]\n* [https://www.facebook.com/bluedragonvietnam/ Blue Dragon's Facebook page]\n* [https://twitter.com/BlueDragonVN Blue Dragon on Twitter]\n\n===Resources and materials===\n*[http://www.travelfish.org/beginners_detail/vietnam/140 Travelfish article]\n*[http://www.brandeis.edu/magazine/2014/winter/featured-stories/van_ta.html Brandeis University article about Blue Dragon's rescue work]\n*[http://phys.org/news/2014-06-child-workers-vietnam-exploitation.html Child Labour in Vietnam]\n*[http://latitude.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/01/vietnams-trade-of-underaged-species/ New York Times article on child trafficking]\n*[http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2015/03/31/4207346.htm 2015 Richard Fidler Conversations interview with Michael Brosowski] \n\n[[Category:Organizations established in 2004]]\n\n[[Category:Children's charities based in Australia]]\n<!-- registered there -->\n\n[[Category:Foreign charities operating in Vietnam]]\n<!-- physical base there -->\n[[Category:Child education organizations]]\n[[Category:Foundations based in Australia]]\n[[Category:Non-profit organisations based in New South Wales]]\n", "name_user": "Wikipedianuhai", "label": "safe", "comment": "sexual slavery in China|sex slaves in China", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Dragon_Children%27s_Foundation"}

The [[recorded history]] of the city goes back to the 3rd century BCE, being mentioned by [[Megasthenes]], the Greek ambassador to the [[Maurya empire]], and [[Kautilya]], a minister of the Mauryan emperor [[Chandragupta Maurya]]. Signs of human settlements and Roman trade links dating back to 300 BC are evident from excavations by [[Archeological Survey of India]] in Manalur.{{sfn|''The Times of India''|13 October 2015}}{{sfn|''The Times of India''|12 October 2015}}{{sfn|''The Hindu''|12 October 2015}} The city is believed to be of significant antiquity and has been ruled, at different times, by the [[Pandyan Kingdom|Pandyas]], [[Cholas]], [[Madurai Sultanate]], [[Vijayanagar Empire]], [[Madurai Nayaks]], [[Nawab of the Carnatic|Carnatic kingdom]], and the [[British East India Company]] [[British Raj]].\n\nThe city has a number of historical monuments, with the [[Meenakshi Temple]] and the [[Tirumalai Nayak Palace]] being the most prominent. Madurai is an important industrial and educational hub in South Tamil Nadu. The city is home to various automobile, [[rubber]], chemical and [[granite]] manufacturing industries.{{sfn|''The Hindu''|25 October 2007}}\n\nMadurai has important government educational institutes such as the [[Madurai Medical College]], Homeopathic Medical College,{{sfn|List of Colleges in Madurai}} [[Government Law College, Madurai|Madurai Law College]], Agricultural College and Research Institute. Madurai city is administered by [[Madurai Municipal Corporation|a municipal corporation]] established in 1971 as per the Municipal Corporation Act.

The region is believed to have been covered with Kadamba forest and hence called Kadambavanam.{{sfn|Reddy| 2013| p= 10}} The city is referred by various names including \"Madurai\", \"Koodal\",  \"Malligai Maanagar\", \"Naanmadakoodal\" and \"Thirualavai\". The word ''Madurai'' may be derived from Madhura (sweetness) arising out of the divine nectar showered on the city by the Hindu god [[Shiva|Siva]] from his matted hair.{{sfn|Harman| 1992| pp= 30\u201336}}  Another theory is that ''Madurai'' is the derivative of the word ''Marutham'', which refers to the type of landscape of the [[Sangam Age|Sangam age]]. A town in the neighbouring [[Dindigul district]] is called Vada Madurai (''North Madurai'') and another in [[Sivagangai district]] is called [[Manamadurai]]. The different names by which the city has been referred to historically are listed in the 7th-century poem ''Thiruvilayaadal puraanam'' written by Paranjothi Munivar.{{sfn|Harman| 1992| pp= 30\u201336}}{{sfn|Reynolds|Bardwell| 1987| pp= 12\u201325}}\n\n''Koodal'' means an assembly or congregation of scholarly people, referring to the three Tamil Sangams held at Madurai.

A town in the neighbouring [[Dindigul district]] is called Vada Madurai (''North Madurai'') and another in [[Sivagangai district]] is called [[Manamadurai]].

While Peru felt that the matter was already decided in the [[Ecuadorian-Peruvian War]] of 1941, Ecuador did not agree with the [[Rio de Janeiro Protocol]]. Later in 1998 the Guarantors of the Rio Protocol ruled that the border of the undelimited zone was indeed the line of the Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor, as Peru had been claiming since the 1940s. \n\nIn the aftermath of the incident, both sides increased their military presence along the [[Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor]] area and Cenepa Valley, starting an escalating spiral of tension and provocation that finally resulted in another military confrontation in 1995, the [[Cenepa War]].\n\nWhile the name ''Paquisha War'' is widely used by the international community and Ecuador, in Spanish this incident is also known as the '''Falso Paquisha War''' (''Conflicto del Falso Paquisha'') in Peru and, occasionally, as the '''Paquisha Incident''' or the '''Upper Comaina Conflict''' (''conflicto del Alto Comaina'').\n\n==Historical background==\n''For details on the history of the border dispute between Ecuador and Peru, please see [[History of the Ecuadorian-Peruvian territorial dispute]].''\n\n===The Paquisha or \"Fake Paquisha\" Incident===\nThe dispute revolved around the existence of three Ecuadorian military outposts, called Paquisha, Mayaico, and Machinaza, located in the valley of the Comaina River, beyond the eastern slopes of the [[Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor|Condor range]] (in Spanish, ''Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor''). While these posts were located in the as yet non-demarcated zone of the Ecuadorian-Peruvian border, the establishment of these posts was considered by the Peruvian Government as a violation of a ''[[status quo]]'' line arranged between the military leaders of both countries in the course of several meetings at the end of the 1970s. During these agreements both sides would have agreed not to establish any new military posts in the disputed areas,<ref>Mena, 1981</ref> which would have meant for Ecuador not to establish any military presence to the east of the ridgeline of the Condor Range.\n\nThe Ecuadorian possession of these posts was denounced by Peruvian representatives at the foreign ministers' meeting of the [[Organization of American States|OAS]], on February 2, 1981. During this meeting, the Peruvian Foreign Minister, [[Javier Arias Stella]], called the three Ecuadorian military outposts ''falsos'' (\"fakes\"), despite Ecuadorian sovereignty.\n\nEcuadorians indicated that these detachments corresponded to the \"Paquisha\" base established in Ecuadorian territory. But, after measuring the coordinates, it was found that they did not correspond to the aforementioned Paquisha accepted in the [[Rio Protocol|Protocol of Rio de Janeiro]] but, as the Peruvian president [[Fernando Bela\u00fande Terry|Fernando Bela\u00fande]] described it, to a \"False Paquisha\", a name he gave to distinguish it easily from the first Paquisha that was legal according to the Rio protocol of 1942<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306200426/https://www.mindef.gob.pe/vercontenido.php?archivo=menu%2Fhistoricos%2Fefem-nacional%2Fefeme-enero3.htm&retorno=si|title=Operations of the False Paquisha|last=|first=|website=Ministry of Defense of Peru|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>.\n\nThe Ecuadorian Foreign Minister, [[Alfonso Barrera Valderde]], responded to this allegation stating that when Ecuador responded to the attacks on January 22, it always specified that the attacks were being made against the ''destacamentos'' (military outposts) of Paquisha, Mayaicu, and Machinaza, not against the similarly named Ecuadorian towns.<ref>Mena Villamar, Claudio. ''Paquisha: toda la verdad''. Letranueva. Quito, 1981.</ref>\n\nThe [[Peru]] prepared a contingent to recover the post, formed mainly by [[Mil Mi-8|Mi-8TV]] transport helicopters of the Army Aviation and Air Group No. 3, formed by [[Peruvian Air Force|FAP]] A-37, [[Sukhoi Su-17|Su-22]] and [[Dassault Mirage 5|Mirage 5]] aircraft to support to the Jungle Infantry<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://caretas.pe/sociedad/%c2%91yo-sobrevivi-al-condor%c2%92/|title=I survived the Condor|last=|first=|date=|website=Magazine Caretas|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>.\n\nThe [[Peruvian Air Force|Fuerza A\u00e9rea del Peru (FAP)]] flew many sorties with [[Cessna T-37#A-37B|A-37B]], [[Dassault Mirage III|Mirage 5P]] and [[Su-22]] to support these operations.

Levoyer proposed a new plan which placed all personnel, weapons, supplies, etc., in twenty-four hours in the front and ready to fulfill the mission of defense.\n\nThe Peruvian armed forces were surprised by the rapid deployment of Ecuadorian forces, so, thinking that Levoyer and his men might invade the north of Peru, they organized anti-tank defense lines, trenches, and other defenses.\n\nFortunately, events did not lead to general war. The widespread confrontation was avoided probably because of the direct talks between top military Commanders of the two countries, and the military Delegates of Chile, Argentina, Brazil and USA. The talks took place in the border line near the Pacific Ocean, in the towns of Huaquillas (Ecuador, Province of El Oro) and Aguas Verdes (Peru, Department of Tumbes). The result was the Sorrosa-Du Bois Act.\n\nThe cycle of direct face to face talks included Levoyer who was called by the Peruvians the leader of the \"hard line\".

Despite several proposals to complete demarcation of the border, no agreement was possible at that time.\n\nSeveral military bases were built up and down the Cordillera by both countries, and the region was militarized. The Peruvian bases were serviced by helicopter, while on the Ecuadorian side, gravel roads were constructed to several military border posts.\n\nSome sources claim that the Ecuadorian resistance to the full implementation of the border demarcation during the 1970s and 1980s was almost entirely due to domestic political struggles.\n\nAccording to the USIP, after this war, Ecuador's Foreign Ministry conducted a national opinion survey that reportedly confirmed the popularity of nullification of the Rio Protocol and Ecuador's right to sovereign access to the [[Amazon river]].

While Peru felt that the matter was already decided in the [[Ecuadorian-Peruvian War]] of 1941, Ecuador did not agree with the [[Rio de Janeiro Protocol]]. Later in 1998 the Guarantors of the Rio Protocol ruled that the border of the undelimited zone was indeed the line of the Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor, as Peru had been claiming since the 1940s. \n\nIn the aftermath of the incident, both sides increased their military presence along the [[Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor]] area and Cenepa Valley, starting an escalating spiral of tension and provocation that finally resulted in another military confrontation in 1995, the [[Cenepa War]].\n\nWhile the name ''Paquisha War'' is widely used by the international community and Ecuador, in Spanish this incident is also known as the '''Falso Paquisha War''' (''Conflicto del Falso Paquisha'') in Peru and, occasionally, as the '''Paquisha Incident''' or the '''Upper Comaina Conflict''' (''conflicto del Alto Comaina'').\n\n==Historical background==\n''For details on the history of the border dispute between Ecuador and Peru, please see [[History of the Ecuadorian-Peruvian territorial dispute]].''\n\n===The Paquisha or \"Fake Paquisha\" Incident===\nThe dispute revolved around the existence of three Ecuadorian military outposts, called Paquisha, Mayaico, and Machinaza, located in the valley of the Comaina River, beyond the eastern slopes of the [[Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor|Condor range]] (in Spanish, ''Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor''). While these posts were located in the as yet non-demarcated zone of the Ecuadorian-Peruvian border, the establishment of these posts was considered by the Peruvian Government as a violation of a ''[[status quo]]'' line arranged between the military leaders of both countries in the course of several meetings at the end of the 1970s. During these agreements both sides would have agreed not to establish any new military posts in the disputed areas,<ref>Mena, 1981</ref> which would have meant for Ecuador not to establish any military presence to the east of the ridgeline of the Condor Range.\n\nThe Ecuadorian possession of these posts was denounced by Peruvian representatives at the foreign ministers' meeting of the [[Organization of American States|OAS]], on February 2, 1981. During this meeting, the Peruvian Foreign Minister, [[Javier Arias Stella]], called the three Ecuadorian military outposts ''falsos'' (\"fakes\"), despite Ecuadorian sovereignty.\n\nEcuadorians indicated that these detachments corresponded to the \"Paquisha\" base established in Ecuadorian territory. But, after measuring the coordinates, it was found that they did not correspond to the aforementioned Paquisha accepted in the [[Rio Protocol|Protocol of Rio de Janeiro]] but, as the Peruvian president [[Fernando Bela\u00fande Terry|Fernando Bela\u00fande]] described it, to a \"False Paquisha\", a name he gave to distinguish it easily from the first Paquisha that was legal according to the Rio protocol of 1942<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306200426/https://www.mindef.gob.pe/vercontenido.php?archivo=menu%2Fhistoricos%2Fefem-nacional%2Fefeme-enero3.htm&retorno=si|title=Operations of the False Paquisha|last=|first=|website=Ministry of Defense of Peru|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>.\n\nThe Ecuadorian Foreign Minister, [[Alfonso Barrera Valderde]], responded to this allegation stating that when Ecuador responded to the attacks on January 22, it always specified that the attacks were being made against the ''destacamentos'' (military outposts) of Paquisha, Mayaicu, and Machinaza, not against the similarly named Ecuadorian towns.<ref>Mena Villamar, Claudio.

Quito, 1981.</ref>\n\nThe [[Peru]] prepared a contingent to recover the post, formed mainly by [[Mil Mi-8|Mi-8TV]] transport helicopters of the Army Aviation and Air Group No. 3, formed by [[Peruvian Air Force|FAP]] A-37, [[Sukhoi Su-17|Su-22]] and [[Dassault Mirage 5|Mirage 5]] aircraft to support to the Jungle Infantry<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://caretas.pe/sociedad/%c2%91yo-sobrevivi-al-condor%c2%92/|title=I survived the Condor|last=|first=|date=|website=Magazine Caretas|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>.\n\nThe [[Peruvian Air Force|Fuerza A\u00e9rea del Peru (FAP)]] flew many sorties with [[Cessna T-37#A-37B|A-37B]], [[Dassault Mirage III|Mirage 5P]] and [[Su-22]] to support these operations.

Last.fm will play tracks that do not appear in the user's library, but are often played by other users with similar interests. As this approach leverages the behavior of users, it is an example of a collaborative filtering technique.\n* Pandora uses the properties of a song or artist (a subset of the 400 attributes provided by the [[Music Genome Project]]) to seed a \"station\" that plays music with similar properties. User feedback is used to refine the station's results, deemphasizing certain attributes when a user \"dislikes\" a particular song and emphasizing other attributes when a user \"likes\" a song.

Breese |author2=David Heckerman |author3=Carl Kadie  |last-author-amp=yes |year = 1998 |title = Empirical analysis of predictive algorithms for collaborative filtering |conference =  In Proceedings of the Fourteenth conference on Uncertainty in artificial intelligence (UAI'98) |arxiv=1301.7363 }}\n</ref> Collaborative filtering is based on the assumption that people who agreed in the past will agree in the future, and that they will like similar kinds of items as they liked in the past. The system generates recommendations using only information about rating profiles for different users or items. By locating peer users/items with a rating history similar to the current user or item, they generate recommendations using this neighborhood. Collaborative filtering methods are classified as memory-based and model-based. A well-known example of memory-based approaches is the user-based algorithm,<ref>{{cite report|author1=Breese, John S.|author2=Heckerman, David|author3=Kadie, Carl|url=http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/69656/tr-98-12.pdf|title=Empirical Analysis of Predictive Algorithms for Collaborative Filtering|year=1998|publisher=Microsoft Research}}</ref> while that of model-based approaches is the [[Kernel-Mapping Recommender]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Kernel-Mapping Recommender system algorithms|doi=10.1016/j.ins.2012.04.012|volume=208|journal=Information Sciences|pages=81\u2013104|date=2012-11-15|last1=Ghazanfar|first1=Mustansar Ali|last2=Pr\u00fcgel-Bennett|first2=Adam|last3=Szedmak|first3=Sandor|citeseerx=10.1.1.701.7729}}</ref>\n\nA key advantage of the collaborative filtering approach is that it does not rely on machine analyzable content and therefore it is capable of accurately recommending complex items such as movies without requiring an \"understanding\" of the item itself. Many algorithms have been used in measuring user similarity or item similarity in recommender systems. For example, the [[k-nearest neighbors algorithm|k-nearest neighbor]] (k-NN) approach<ref>{{cite web |last = Sarwar |first = B. |last2 = Karypis |first2 = G. |last3 = Konstan |first3 = J. |last4 = Riedl |first4 = J. |year = 2000 |url = http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/node/122 |title = Application of Dimensionality Reduction in Recommender System A Case Study }},</ref> and the [[Pearson correlation|Pearson Correlation]] as first implemented by Allen.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Allen | first = R.B. | date=1990 | title=User Models: Theory, Method, Practice| publisher = International J. Man-Machine Studies}}</ref>\n\nWhen building a model from a user's behavior, a distinction is often made between explicit and [[implicit data collection|implicit]] forms of [[data collection]].\n\nExamples of explicit data collection include the following:\n* Asking a user to rate an item on a sliding scale.\n* Asking a user to search.\n* Asking a user to rank a collection of items from favorite to least favorite.\n* Presenting two items to a user and asking him/her to choose the better one of them.\n* Asking a user to create a list of items that he/she likes (see ''[[Rocchio algorithm|Rocchio classification]]'' or other similar techniques).\n\nExamples of [[implicit data collection]] include the following:\n* Observing the items that a user views in an online store.\n* Analyzing item/user viewing times.<ref>{{Cite journal |last = Parsons |first = J. |last2 = Ralph |first2 = P. |last3 = Gallagher |first3 = K. |date = July 2004 |title = Using viewing time to infer user preference in recommender systems |publisher = AAAI Workshop in Semantic Web Personalization, San Jose, California }}.</ref>\n* Keeping a record of the items that a user purchases online.\n* Obtaining a list of items that a user has listened to or watched on his/her computer.\n* Analyzing the user's social network and discovering similar likes and dislikes.\n\nCollaborative filtering approaches often suffer from three problems: [[Cold start (computing)|cold start]], scalability, and sparsity.<ref name=\"Lee2007\">Sanghack Lee and Jihoon Yang and Sung-Yong Park, [https://books.google.com/books?id=u4qzlZAEjegC&pg=PA396&lpg=PA396&dq=sparsity+problem+content-based&source=bl&ots=ZEI50fmXTh&sig=jcwEba0LykRiLnYVbLYUwdrHYEo&hl=en&ei=-W7CTvboCIeHsgKf9NHDBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=sparsity%20problem%20content-based&f=false Discovery of Hidden Similarity on Collaborative Filtering to Overcome Sparsity Problem], Discovery Science, 2007.</ref>\n* '''Cold start''': For a new user or item, there isn't enough data to make accurate recommendations.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\"rubens2016\"/><ref name=\"elahi2016\"/>\n* '''Scalability''': In many of the environments in which these systems make recommendations, there are millions of users and products. Thus, a large amount of computation power is often necessary to calculate recommendations.\n* '''Sparsity''': The number of items sold on major e-commerce sites is extremely large. The most active users will only have rated a small subset of the overall database. Thus, even the most popular items have very few ratings.\n\nOne of the most famous examples of collaborative filtering is item-to-item collaborative filtering (people who buy x also buy y), an algorithm popularized by [[Amazon.com]]'s recommender system.<ref name=\"patft.uspto.gov\">[http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PTXT&s1=6,266,649.PN.&OS=PN/6,266,649&RS=PN/6,266,649 Collaborative Recommendations Using Item-to-Item Similarity Mappings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316185024/http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PTXT&s1=6%2C266%2C649.PN.&OS=PN%2F6%2C266%2C649&RS=PN%2F6%2C266%2C649 |date=2015-03-16 }}</ref>\n\nMany [[social networks]] originally used collaborative filtering to recommend new friends, groups, and other social connections by examining the network of connections between a user and their friends.<ref name=\"handbook\">Francesco Ricci and Lior Rokach and Bracha Shapira, [http://www.inf.unibz.it/~ricci/papers/intro-rec-sys-handbook.pdf Introduction to Recommender Systems Handbook], Recommender Systems Handbook, Springer, 2011, pp. 1-35</ref> Collaborative filtering is still used as part of hybrid systems.\n\n=== Content-based filtering ===\n\nAnother common approach when designing recommender systems is '''content-based filtering'''. Content-based filtering methods are based on a description of the item and a profile of the user's preferences.<ref name=\"Aggarwal16Book\">{{cite book|last1=Aggarwal|first1=Charu C.|title=Recommender Systems: The Textbook|date=2016|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319296579}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Peter Brusilovsky|title=The Adaptive Web|year=2007|isbn=978-3-540-72078-2|page=325|author-link=Peter Brusilovsky}}</ref> These methods are best suited to situations where there is known data on an item (name, location, description, etc.), but not on the user. Content-based recommenders treat recommendation as a user-specific classification problem and learn a classifier for the user's likes and dislikes based on an item's features.\n\nIn this system, keywords are used to describe the items and a [[user profile]] is built to indicate the type of item this user likes. In other words, these algorithms try to recommend items that are similar to those that a user liked in the past, or is examining in the present. It does not rely on a user sign-in mechanism to generate this often temporary profile. In particular, various candidate items are compared with items previously rated by the user and the best-matching items are recommended. This approach has its roots in [[information retrieval]] and [[information filtering]] research.\n\nTo create a [[user profile]], the system mostly focuses on two types of information:\n\n1. A model of the user's preference.\n\n2. A history of the user's interaction with the recommender system.\n\nBasically, these methods use an item profile (i.e., a set of discrete attributes and features) characterizing the item within the system. To abstract the features of the items in the system, an item presentation algorithm is applied. A widely used algorithm is the [[tf\u2013idf]] representation (also called vector space representation).<ref>D.H. Wang, Y.C. Liang, D.Xu, X.Y. Feng, R.C. Guan(2018), \"[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950705118302107 A content-based recommender system for computer science publications]\", ''[[Knowledge-Based Systems]]'', 157: 1-9</ref> The system creates a content-based profile of users based on a weighted vector of item features. The weights denote the importance of each feature to the user and can be computed from individually rated content vectors using a variety of techniques. Simple approaches use the average values of the rated item vector while other sophisticated methods use machine learning techniques such as [[Naive Bayes classifier|Bayesian Classifiers]], [[cluster analysis]], [[decision trees]], and [[artificial neural networks]] in order to estimate the probability that the user is going to like the item.<ref>{{cite news|title=Online Recommender Systems \u2013 How Does a Website Know What I Want?|url=http://blogs.ams.org/mathgradblog/2015/05/25/online-recommender-systems-website-want/|last=Blanda, Stephanie|work=American Mathematical Society|date=May 25, 2015|accessdate=October 31, 2016}}</ref>\n\nA key issue with content-based filtering is whether the system is able to learn user preferences from users' actions regarding one content source and use them across other content types. When the system is limited to recommending content of the same type as the user is already using, the value from the recommendation system is significantly less than when other content types from other services can be recommended. For example, recommending news articles based on browsing of news is useful, but would be much more useful when music, videos, products, discussions etc. from different services can be recommended based on news browsing. To overcome this, most content-based recommender systems now use some form of hybrid system.\n\nContent-based recommender systems can also include opinion-based recommender systems. In some cases, users are allowed to leave text review or feedback on the items. These user-generated texts are implicit data for the recommender system because they are potentially rich resource of both feature/aspects of the item, and users' evaluation/sentiment to the item. Features extracted from the user-generated reviews are improved [[Metadata|meta-data]] of items, because as they also reflect aspects of the item like [[Metadata|meta-data]], extracted features are widely concerned by the users. Sentiments extracted from the reviews can be seen as users' rating scores on the corresponding features. Popular approaches of opinion-based recommender system utilize various techniques including [[text mining]], [[information retrieval]], [[sentiment analysis]] (see also [[Multimodal sentiment analysis]]) and deep learning <ref>X.Y. Feng, H. Zhang, Y.J. Ren, P.H. Shang, Y. Zhu, Y.C. Liang, R.C. Guan, D.

Instead of developing recommendation techniques based on a single criterion value, the overall preference of user u for the item i, these systems try to predict a rating for unexplored items of u by exploiting preference information on multiple criteria that affect this overall preference value. Several researchers approach MCRS as a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem, and apply MCDM methods and techniques to implement MCRS systems.<ref>{{Cite journal |last = Lakiotaki |first = K. |last2 = Matsatsinis |last3 = Tsoukias |first3 = A |title = Multicriteria User Modeling in Recommender Systems |journal = IEEE Intelligent Systems |volume = 26 |issue = 2 |pages = 64\u201376 |doi=10.1109/mis.2011.33|date = March 2011 |citeseerx = 10.1.1.476.6726 }}</ref> See this chapter<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ids.csom.umn.edu/faculty/gedas/NSFCareer/MCRS-chapter-2010.pdf |title=Multi-Criteria Recommender Systems |authors=Gediminas Adomavicius, Nikos Manouselis, YoungOk Kwon |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140630021251/http://ids.csom.umn.edu/faculty/gedas/NSFCareer/MCRS-chapter-2010.pdf |archivedate=2014-06-30 }}</ref> for an extended introduction.\n\n=== Risk-aware recommender systems ===\nThe majority of existing approaches to recommender systems focus on recommending the most relevant content to users using contextual information, yet do not take into account the risk of disturbing the user with unwanted notifications. It is important to consider the risk of upsetting the user by pushing recommendations in certain circumstances, for instance, during a professional meeting, early morning, or late at night. Therefore, the performance of the recommender system depends in part on the degree to which it has incorporated the risk into the recommendation process. One option to manage this issue is ''DRARS'', a system which models the context-aware recommendation as a [[Multi-armed bandit|bandit problem]]. This system combines a content-based technique and a contextual bandit algorithm.<ref name=\"Bouneffouf2013\">{{citation | type=Ph.D.\n | last = Bouneffouf  | first = Djallel | title= DRARS, A Dynamic Risk-Aware Recommender System\n | publisher = Institut National des T\u00e9l\u00e9communications | year = 2013 | url = http://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01026136/fr/}}</ref>\n\n=== Mobile recommender systems ===\n{{see|Location based recommendation}}\nMobile recommender systems make use of internet-accessing [[smart phones]] to offer personalized, context-sensitive recommendations.

There is no reason why several different techniques of the same type could not be hybridized. Hybrid approaches can be implemented in several ways: by making content-based and collaborative-based predictions separately and then combining them; by adding content-based capabilities to a collaborative-based approach (and vice versa); or by unifying the approaches into one model (see<ref name=\"Toward the Next Generation of Recommender Systems\" /> for a complete review of recommender systems). Several studies that empirically compare the performance of the hybrid with the pure collaborative and content-based methods and demonstrated that the hybrid methods can provide more accurate\nrecommendations than pure approaches. These methods can also be used to overcome some of the common problems in recommender systems such as cold start and the sparsity problem, as well as the knowledge engineering bottleneck in [[Knowledge base|knowledge-based]] approaches.<ref>Rinke Hoekstra, [http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/sites/default/files/swj32.pdf The Knowledge Reengineering Bottleneck], Semantic Web \u2013 Interoperability, Usability, Applicability 1 (2010) 1, IOS Press</ref>\n\n[[Netflix]] is a good example of the use of hybrid recommender systems.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gomez-Uribe|first1=Carlos A.|last2=Hunt|first2=Neil|title=The Netflix Recommender System|journal=ACM Transactions on Management Information Systems|date=28 December 2015|volume=6|issue=4|pages=1\u201319|doi=10.1145/2843948|doi-access=free}}</ref> The website makes recommendations by comparing the watching and searching habits of similar users (i.e., collaborative filtering) as well as by offering movies that share characteristics with films that a user has rated highly (content-based filtering).\n\nSome hybridization techniques include:\n*'''Weighted''': Combining the score of different recommendation components numerically.\n*'''Switching''': Choosing among recommendation components and applying the selected one.\n*'''Mixed''': Recommendations from different recommenders are presented together to give the recommendation.\n*'''Feature Combination''': Features derived from different knowledge sources are combined together and given to a single recommendation algorithm.\n*'''Feature Augmentation''': Computing a feature or set of features, which is then part of the input to the next technique.\n*'''Cascade''': Recommenders are given strict priority, with the lower priority ones breaking ties in the scoring of the higher ones.\n*'''Meta-level''': One recommendation technique is applied and produces some sort of model, which is then the input used by the next technique.<ref name=hybrids>Robin Burke, [http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/~acristea/courses/CS411/2010/Book%20-%20The%20Adaptive%20Web/HybridWebRecommenderSystems.pdf Hybrid Web Recommender Systems] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140912085014/http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/~acristea/courses/CS411/2010/Book%20-%20The%20Adaptive%20Web/HybridWebRecommenderSystems.pdf |date=2014-09-12 }}, pp. 377-408, The Adaptive Web, Peter Brusilovsky, Alfred Kobsa, Wolfgang Nejdl (Ed.), Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Germany, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Vol. 4321, May 2007, 978-3-540-72078-2.</ref>\n\n== The Netflix Prize ==\n{{Main|Netflix Prize}}\n\nOne of the events that energized research in recommender systems was the [[Netflix Prize]]. From 2006 to 2009, Netflix sponsored a competition, offering a grand prize of $1,000,000 to the team that could take an offered dataset of over 100 million movie ratings and return recommendations that were 10% more accurate than those offered by the company's existing recommender system. This competition energized the search for new and more accurate algorithms. On 21 September 2009, the grand prize of US$1,000,000 was given to the BellKor's Pragmatic Chaos team using tiebreaking rules.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">{{cite news|last1=Lohr|first1=Steve|title=A $1 Million Research Bargain for Netflix, and Maybe a Model for Others|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/22/technology/internet/22netflix.html|website=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\nThe most accurate algorithm in 2007 used an ensemble method of 107 different algorithmic approaches, blended into a single prediction. As stated by the winners, Bell et al.:<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.netflixprize.com/assets/ProgressPrize2007_KorBell.pdf |author1=R. Bell |author2=Y. Koren |author3=C.

''Our experience is that most efforts should be concentrated in deriving substantially different approaches, rather than refining a single technique.''  Consequently, our solution is an ensemble of many methods.</blockquote>\n\nMany benefits accrued to the web due to the Netflix project. Some teams have taken their technology and applied it to other markets. Some members from the team that finished second place founded [[Gravity R&D]], a recommendation engine that's active in the RecSys community.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/><ref>{{cite web|last1=Bodoky|first1=Thomas|title=M\u00e1trixfaktoriz\u00e1ci\u00f3 one million dollars|url=http://index.hu/tech/net/2009/08/07/matrixfaktorizacio_egymillio_dollarert/|website=Index|date=2009-08-06}}</ref> 4-Tell, Inc. created a Netflix project\u2013derived solution for ecommerce websites.\n\nA number of privacy issues arose around the dataset offered by Netflix for the [[Netflix Prize]] competition.

To measure the [[effectiveness]] of recommender systems, and compare different approaches, three types of [[evaluation]]s are available: user studies, [[A/B testing|online evaluations (A/B tests)]], and offline evaluations.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe commonly used metrics are the [[mean squared error]] and [[root mean squared error]], the latter having been used in the Netflix Prize. The information retrieval metrics such as [[precision and recall]] or [[Discounted Cumulative Gain|DCG]] are useful to assess the quality of a recommendation method. Diversity, novelty, and coverage are also considered as important aspects in evaluation.<ref>Lathia, N., Hailes, S., Capra, L., Amatriain, X.: [http://www.academia.edu/download/46585553/lathia_sigir10.pdf Temporal diversity in recommender systems]. In: Proceedings of the 33rd International ACMSIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, SIGIR 2010, pp. 210\u2013217. ACM, New York</ref> However, many of the classic evaluation measures are highly criticized.<ref name=\"Turpin2001\">{{cite book| author=Turpin, Andrew H, Hersh, William| chapter=Why batch and user evaluations do not give the same results| title=Proceedings of the 24th annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval| year=2001| pages=225\u2013231}}</ref>\n\nUser studies are rather small scale. A few dozens or hundreds of users are presented recommendations created by different recommendation approaches, and then the users judge which recommendations are best. In A/B tests, recommendations are shown to typically thousands of users of a real product, and the recommender system randomly picks at least two different recommendation approaches to generate recommendations. The effectiveness is measured with implicit measures of effectiveness such as [[conversion rate]] or [[click-through rate]]. Offline evaluations are based on historic data, e.g. a dataset that contains information about how users previously rated movies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/|title=MovieLens dataset|last=|first=|date=2013-09-06|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe effectiveness of recommendation approaches is then measured based on how well a recommendation approach can predict the users' ratings in the dataset. While a rating is an explicit expression of whether a user liked a movie, such information is not available in all domains. For instance, in the domain of citation recommender systems, users typically do not rate a citation or recommended article. In such cases, offline evaluations may use implicit measures of effectiveness. For instance, it may be assumed that a recommender system is effective that is able to recommend as many articles as possible that are contained in a research article's reference list. However, this kind of offline evaluations is seen critical by many researchers.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=ChenHung-Hsuan|last2=ChungChu-An|last3=HuangHsin-Chien|last4=TsuiWen|date=2017-09-01|title=Common Pitfalls in Training and Evaluating Recommender Systems|journal=ACM SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter|volume=19|pages=37\u201345|language=EN|doi=10.1145/3137597.3137601}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=User Modeling, Adaptation, and Personalization|last=Jannach|first=Dietmar|last2=Lerche|first2=Lukas|last3=Gedikli|first3=Fatih|last4=Bonnin|first4=Geoffray|date=2013-06-10|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=9783642388439|editor-last=Carberry|editor-first=Sandra|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|pages=25\u201337|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-38844-6_3|editor-last2=Weibelzahl|editor-first2=Stephan|editor-last3=Micarelli|editor-first3=Alessandro|editor-last4=Semeraro|editor-first4=Giovanni|citeseerx = 10.1.1.465.96}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Turpin|first=Andrew H.|last2=Hersh|first2=William|date=2001-01-01|title=Why Batch and User Evaluations Do Not Give the Same Results|journal=Proceedings of the 24th Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval|series=SIGIR '01|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=[https://archive.org/details/proceedingsof24t0000inte/page/225 225\u2013231]|doi=10.1145/383952.383992|isbn=978-1581133318|citeseerx=10.1.1.165.5800|url=https://archive.org/details/proceedingsof24t0000inte/page/225}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" /> For instance, it has been shown that results of offline evaluations have low correlation with results from user studies or A/B tests.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite book|title=Research and Advanced Technology for Digital Libraries|volume = 9316|last1=Langer|first1=Stefan|date=2015-09-14|publisher=Springer International Publishing|isbn=9783319245911|editor-last=Kapidakis|editor-first=Sarantos|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|pages=153\u2013168|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-24592-8_12|editor-last2=Mazurek|editor-first2=Cezary|editor-last3=Werla|editor-first3=Marcin|chapter = A Comparison of Offline Evaluations, Online Evaluations, and User Studies in the Context of Research-Paper Recommender Systems}}</ref> A dataset popular for offline evaluation has been shown to contain duplicate data and thus to lead to wrong conclusions in the evaluation of algorithms.<ref name=\"BasaranNtoutsi2017\">{{cite book|last1=Basaran|first1=Daniel|title=Proceedings of the 2017 SIAM International Conference on Data Mining|last2=Ntoutsi|first2=Eirini|last3=Zimek|first3=Arthur|year=2017|pages=390\u2013398|doi=10.1137/1.9781611974973.44|isbn=978-1-61197-497-3}}</ref> Often, results of so-called offline evaluations do not correlate with actually assessed user-satisfaction.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Beel|first=Joeran|last2=Genzmehr|first2=Marcel|last3=Langer|first3=Stefan|last4=N\u00fcrnberger|first4=Andreas|last5=Gipp|first5=Bela|date=2013-01-01|title=A Comparative Analysis of Offline and Online Evaluations and Discussion of Research Paper Recommender System Evaluation|journal=Proceedings of the International Workshop on Reproducibility and Replication in Recommender Systems Evaluation|series=RepSys '13|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=7\u201314|doi=10.1145/2532508.2532511|isbn=9781450324656|citeseerx=10.1.1.1031.973}}</ref> This is probably because offline training is highly biased toward the highly reachable items, and offline testing data is highly influenced by the outputs of the online recommendation module.<ref name=\":4\" /> Researchers have concluded that the results of offline evaluations should be viewed critically.\n\n=== Beyond accuracy ===\nTypically, research on recommender systems is concerned about finding the most accurate recommendation algorithms.

Sys.: Algo. and Evaluation }}</ref> Current recommender systems typically combine one or more approaches into a hybrid system.\n\nThe differences between collaborative and content-based filtering can be demonstrated by comparing two early music recommender systems \u2013 [[Last.fm]] and [[Pandora Radio]].\n* Last.fm creates a \"station\" of recommended songs by observing what bands and individual tracks the user has listened to on a regular basis and comparing those against the listening behavior of other users. Last.fm will play tracks that do not appear in the user's library, but are often played by other users with similar interests. As this approach leverages the behavior of users, it is an example of a collaborative filtering technique.\n* Pandora uses the properties of a song or artist (a subset of the 400 attributes provided by the [[Music Genome Project]]) to seed a \"station\" that plays music with similar properties. User feedback is used to refine the station's results, deemphasizing certain attributes when a user \"dislikes\" a particular song and emphasizing other attributes when a user \"likes\" a song. This is an example of a content-based approach.\n\nEach type of system has its strengths and weaknesses. In the above example, Last.fm requires a large amount of information about a user to make accurate recommendations. This is an example of the [[Cold start (computing)|cold start]] problem, and is common in collaborative filtering systems.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=ChenHung-Hsuan|last2=ChenPu|date=2019-01-09|title=Differentiating Regularization Weights -- A Simple Mechanism to Alleviate Cold Start in Recommender Systems|journal=ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (TKDD)|volume=13|pages=1\u201322|language=EN|doi=10.1145/3285954}}</ref><ref name=\"rubens2016\">{{cite book\n|last1=Rubens |first1=Neil\n|last2= [https://www.linkedin.com/in/mehdielahi Elahi]|first2=Mehdi\n |last3=Sugiyama|first3=Masashi|last4=Kaplan|first4=Dain|editor1-last=Ricci\n |editor1-first=Francesco\n |editor2-last=Rokach|editor2-first=Lior\n |editor3-last=Shapira |editor3-first=Bracha\n |title=Recommender Systems Handbook\n |date=2016\n |publisher=Springer US\n |isbn=978-1-4899-7637-6\n |edition=2\n |chapter=Active Learning in Recommender Systems\n |chapter-url = https://rd.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4899-7637-6\n|doi=10.1007/978-1-4899-7637-6_24\n}}</ref><ref name=\"elahi2016\">\n{{cite journal|last1= [https://www.linkedin.com/in/mehdielahi Elahi]|first1=Mehdi\n|last2= [http://www.inf.unibz.it/~ricci/ Ricci]|first2=Francesco\n|last3=Rubens|first3=Neil\n|title=A survey of active learning in collaborative filtering recommender systems|journal=Computer Science Review\n|volume=20\n|pages=29\u201350\n|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303781992|doi=10.1016/j.cosrev.2016.05.002\n|year=2016\n}}\n</ref><ref name=\"schein02\">\n{{cite conference |author = Andrew I.

Breese |author2=David Heckerman |author3=Carl Kadie  |last-author-amp=yes |year = 1998 |title = Empirical analysis of predictive algorithms for collaborative filtering |conference =  In Proceedings of the Fourteenth conference on Uncertainty in artificial intelligence (UAI'98) |arxiv=1301.7363 }}\n</ref> Collaborative filtering is based on the assumption that people who agreed in the past will agree in the future, and that they will like similar kinds of items as they liked in the past. The system generates recommendations using only information about rating profiles for different users or items. By locating peer users/items with a rating history similar to the current user or item, they generate recommendations using this neighborhood.Collaborative filtering methods are classified as memory-based and model-based. A well-known example of memory-based approaches is the user-based algorithm,<ref>{{cite report|author1=Breese, John S.|author2=Heckerman, David|author3=Kadie, Carl|url=http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/69656/tr-98-12.pdf|title=Empirical Analysis of Predictive Algorithms for Collaborative Filtering|year=1998|publisher=Microsoft Research}}</ref> while that of model-based approaches is the [[Kernel-Mapping Recommender]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Kernel-Mapping Recommender system algorithms|doi=10.1016/j.ins.2012.04.012|volume=208|journal=Information Sciences|pages=81\u2013104|date=2012-11-15|last1=Ghazanfar|first1=Mustansar Ali|last2=Pr\u00fcgel-Bennett|first2=Adam|last3=Szedmak|first3=Sandor|citeseerx=10.1.1.701.7729}}</ref>\n\nA key advantage of the collaborative filtering approach is that it does not rely on machine analyzable content and therefore it is capable of accurately recommending complex items such as movies without requiring an \"understanding\" of the item itself. Many algorithms have been used in measuring user similarity or item similarity in recommender systems. For example, the [[k-nearest neighbors algorithm|k-nearest neighbor]] (k-NN) approach<ref>{{cite web |last = Sarwar |first = B. |last2 = Karypis |first2 = G. |last3 = Konstan |first3 = J. |last4 = Riedl |first4 = J. |year = 2000 |url = http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/node/122 |title = Application of Dimensionality Reduction in Recommender System A Case Study }},</ref> and the [[Pearson correlation|Pearson Correlation]] as first implemented by Allen.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Allen | first = R.B. | date=1990 | title=User Models: Theory, Method, Practice| publisher = International J. Man-Machine Studies}}</ref>\n\nWhen building a model from a user's behavior, a distinction is often made between explicit and [[implicit data collection|implicit]] forms of [[data collection]].\n\nExamples of explicit data collection include the following:\n* Asking a user to rate an item on a sliding scale.\n* Asking a user to search.\n* Asking a user to rank a collection of items from favorite to least favorite.\n* Presenting two items to a user and asking him/her to choose the better one of them.\n* Asking a user to create a list of items that he/she likes (see ''[[Rocchio algorithm|Rocchio classification]]'' or other similar techniques).\n\nExamples of [[implicit data collection]] include the following:\n* Observing the items that a user views in an online store.\n* Analyzing item/user viewing times.<ref>{{Cite journal |last = Parsons |first = J. |last2 = Ralph |first2 = P. |last3 = Gallagher |first3 = K. |date = July 2004 |title = Using viewing time to infer user preference in recommender systems |publisher = AAAI Workshop in Semantic Web Personalization, San Jose, California }}.</ref>\n* Keeping a record of the items that a user purchases online.\n* Obtaining a list of items that a user has listened to or watched on his/her computer.\n* Analyzing the user's social network and discovering similar likes and dislikes.\n\nCollaborative filtering approaches often suffer from three problems: [[Cold start (computing)|cold start]], scalability, and sparsity.<ref name=\"Lee2007\">Sanghack Lee and Jihoon Yang and Sung-Yong Park, [https://books.google.com/books?id=u4qzlZAEjegC&pg=PA396&lpg=PA396&dq=sparsity+problem+content-based&source=bl&ots=ZEI50fmXTh&sig=jcwEba0LykRiLnYVbLYUwdrHYEo&hl=en&ei=-W7CTvboCIeHsgKf9NHDBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=sparsity%20problem%20content-based&f=false Discovery of Hidden Similarity on Collaborative Filtering to Overcome Sparsity Problem], Discovery Science, 2007.</ref>\n* '''Cold start''': For a new user or item, there isn't enough data to make accurate recommendations.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\"rubens2016\"/><ref name=\"elahi2016\"/>\n* '''Scalability''': In many of the environments in which these systems make recommendations, there are millions of users and products. Thus, a large amount of computation power is often necessary to calculate recommendations.\n* '''Sparsity''': The number of items sold on major e-commerce sites is extremely large. The most active users will only have rated a small subset of the overall database. Thus, even the most popular items have very few ratings.\n\nOne of the most famous examples of collaborative filtering is item-to-item collaborative filtering (people who buy x also buy y), an algorithm popularized by [[Amazon.com]]'s recommender system.<ref name=\"patft.uspto.gov\">[http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PTXT&s1=6,266,649.PN.&OS=PN/6,266,649&RS=PN/6,266,649 Collaborative Recommendations Using Item-to-Item Similarity Mappings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316185024/http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PTXT&s1=6%2C266%2C649.PN.&OS=PN%2F6%2C266%2C649&RS=PN%2F6%2C266%2C649 |date=2015-03-16 }}</ref>\n\nMany [[social networks]] originally used collaborative filtering to recommend new friends, groups, and other social connections by examining the network of connections between a user and their friends.<ref name=\"handbook\">Francesco Ricci and Lior Rokach and Bracha Shapira, [http://www.inf.unibz.it/~ricci/papers/intro-rec-sys-handbook.pdf Introduction to Recommender Systems Handbook], Recommender Systems Handbook, Springer, 2011, pp. 1-35</ref> Collaborative filtering is still used as part of hybrid systems.\n\n=== Content-based filtering ===\n\nAnother common approach when designing recommender systems is '''content-based filtering'''. Content-based filtering methods are based on a description of the item and a profile of the user's preferences.<ref name=\"Aggarwal16Book\">{{cite book|last1=Aggarwal|first1=Charu C.|title=Recommender Systems: The Textbook|date=2016|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319296579}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Peter Brusilovsky|title=The Adaptive Web|year=2007|isbn=978-3-540-72078-2|page=325|author-link=Peter Brusilovsky}}</ref> These methods are best suited to situations where there is known data on an item (name, location, description, etc.), but not on the user. Content-based recommenders treat recommendation as a user-specific classification problem and learn a classifier for the user's likes and dislikes based on an item's features.\n\nIn this system, keywords are used to describe the items and a [[user profile]] is built to indicate the type of item this user likes. In other words, these algorithms try to recommend items that are similar to those that a user liked in the past, or is examining in the present. It does not rely on a user sign-in mechanism to generate this often temporary profile. In particular, various candidate items are compared with items previously rated by the user and the best-matching items are recommended. This approach has its roots in [[information retrieval]] and [[information filtering]] research.\n\nTo create a [[user profile]], the system mostly focuses on two types of information:\n\n1. A model of the user's preference.\n\n2. A history of the user's interaction with the recommender system.\n\nBasically, these methods use an item profile (i.e., a set of discrete attributes and features) characterizing the item within the system. To abstract the features of the items in the system, an item presentation algorithm is applied. A widely used algorithm is the [[tf\u2013idf]] representation (also called vector space representation).<ref>D.H. Wang, Y.C. Liang, D.Xu, X.Y. Feng, R.C. Guan(2018), \"[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950705118302107 A content-based recommender system for computer science publications]\", ''[[Knowledge-Based Systems]]'', 157: 1-9</ref> The system creates a content-based profile of users based on a weighted vector of item features. The weights denote the importance of each feature to the user and can be computed from individually rated content vectors using a variety of techniques. Simple approaches use the average values of the rated item vector while other sophisticated methods use machine learning techniques such as [[Naive Bayes classifier|Bayesian Classifiers]], [[cluster analysis]], [[decision trees]], and [[artificial neural networks]] in order to estimate the probability that the user is going to like the item.<ref>{{cite news|title=Online Recommender Systems \u2013 How Does a Website Know What I Want?|url=http://blogs.ams.org/mathgradblog/2015/05/25/online-recommender-systems-website-want/|last=Blanda, Stephanie|work=American Mathematical Society|date=May 25, 2015|accessdate=October 31, 2016}}</ref>\n\nA key issue with content-based filtering is whether the system is able to learn user preferences from users' actions regarding one content source and use them across other content types. When the system is limited to recommending content of the same type as the user is already using, the value from the recommendation system is significantly less than when other content types from other services can be recommended. For example, recommending news articles based on browsing of news is useful, but would be much more useful when music, videos, products, discussions etc. from different services can be recommended based on news browsing. To overcome this, most content-based recommender systems now use some form of hybrid system.\n\nContent-based recommender systems can also include opinion-based recommender systems. In some cases, users are allowed to leave text review or feedback on the items. These user-generated texts are implicit data for the recommender system because they are potentially rich resource of both feature/aspects of the item, and users' evaluation/sentiment to the item. Features extracted from the user-generated reviews are improved [[Metadata|meta-data]] of items, because as they also reflect aspects of the item like [[Metadata|meta-data]], extracted features are widely concerned by the users. Sentiments extracted from the reviews can be seen as users' rating scores on the corresponding features. Popular approaches of opinion-based recommender system utilize various techniques including [[text mining]], [[information retrieval]], [[sentiment analysis]] (see also [[Multimodal sentiment analysis]]) and deep learning <ref>X.Y. Feng, H. Zhang, Y.J. Ren, P.H. Shang, Y. Zhu, Y.C. Liang, R.C. Guan, D.

Instead of developing recommendation techniques based on a single criterion value, the overall preference of user u for the item i, these systems try to predict a rating for unexplored items of u by exploiting preference information on multiple criteria that affect this overall preference value. Several researchers approach MCRS as a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem, and apply MCDM methods and techniques to implement MCRS systems.<ref>{{Cite journal |last = Lakiotaki |first = K. |last2 = Matsatsinis |last3 = Tsoukias |first3 = A |title = Multicriteria User Modeling in Recommender Systems |journal = IEEE Intelligent Systems |volume = 26 |issue = 2 |pages = 64\u201376 |doi=10.1109/mis.2011.33|date = March 2011 |citeseerx = 10.1.1.476.6726 }}</ref> See this chapter<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ids.csom.umn.edu/faculty/gedas/NSFCareer/MCRS-chapter-2010.pdf |title=Multi-Criteria Recommender Systems |authors=Gediminas Adomavicius, Nikos Manouselis, YoungOk Kwon |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140630021251/http://ids.csom.umn.edu/faculty/gedas/NSFCareer/MCRS-chapter-2010.pdf |archivedate=2014-06-30 }}</ref> for an extended introduction.\n\n=== Risk-aware recommender systems ===\nThe majority of existing approaches to recommender systems focus on recommending the most relevant content to users using contextual information, yet do not take into account the risk of disturbing the user with unwanted notifications. It is important to consider the risk of upsetting the user by pushing recommendations in certain circumstances, for instance, during a professional meeting, early morning, or late at night. Therefore, the performance of the recommender system depends in part on the degree to which it has incorporated the risk into the recommendation process. One option to manage this issue is ''DRARS'', a system which models the context-aware recommendation as a [[Multi-armed bandit|bandit problem]]. This system combines a content-based technique and a contextual bandit algorithm.<ref name=\"Bouneffouf2013\">{{citation | type=Ph.D.\n | last = Bouneffouf  | first = Djallel | title= DRARS, A Dynamic Risk-Aware Recommender System\n | publisher = Institut National des T\u00e9l\u00e9communications | year = 2013 | url = http://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01026136/fr/}}</ref>\n\n=== Mobile recommender systems ===\n{{see|Location based recommendation}}\nMobile recommender systems make use of internet-accessing [[smart phones]] to offer personalized, context-sensitive recommendations. This is a particularly difficult area of research as mobile data is more complex than data that recommender systems often have to deal with.

It uses this data to recommend a list of pickup points along a route, with the goal of optimizing occupancy times and profits.\n\nMobile recommendation systems have also been successfully built using the \"Web of Data\" as a source for structured information. A good example of such system is SMARTMUSEUM<ref name=\"Ruotsalo2013\">{{cite journal |author1=Tuukka Ruotsalo |author2=Krister Haav |author3=Antony Stoyanov |author4=Sylvain Roche |author5=Elena Fani |author6=Romina Deliai |author7=Eetu M\u00e4kel\u00e4 |author8=Tomi Kauppinen |author9=Eero Hyv\u00f6nen | title = SMARTMUSEUM: A Mobile Recommender System for the Web of Data | pages = 657\u2013662 | year = 2013 | doi = 10.1016/j.websem.2013.03.001 | volume=20 | journal=Web Semantics: Science, Services and Agents on the World Wide Web|citeseerx=10.1.1.676.7109 }}\n</ref> The system uses semantic modelling, information retrieval, and machine learning\ntechniques in order to recommend content matching user interests, even when presented with sparse or minimal user data.\n\n=== Hybrid recommender systems ===\n\nMost recommender systems now use a hybrid approach, combining [[collaborative filtering]], content-based filtering, and other approaches . There is no reason why several different techniques of the same type could not be hybridized. Hybrid approaches can be implemented in several ways: by making content-based and collaborative-based predictions separately and then combining them; by adding content-based capabilities to a collaborative-based approach (and vice versa); or by unifying the approaches into one model (see<ref name=\"Toward the Next Generation of Recommender Systems\" /> for a complete review of recommender systems). Several studies that empirically compare the performance of the hybrid with the pure collaborative and content-based methods and demonstrated that the hybrid methods can provide more accurate\nrecommendations than pure approaches. These methods can also be used to overcome some of the common problems in recommender systems such as cold start and the sparsity problem, as well as the knowledge engineering bottleneck in [[Knowledge base|knowledge-based]] approaches.<ref>Rinke Hoekstra, [http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/sites/default/files/swj32.pdf The Knowledge Reengineering Bottleneck], Semantic Web \u2013 Interoperability, Usability, Applicability 1 (2010) 1, IOS Press</ref>\n\n[[Netflix]] is a good example of the use of hybrid recommender systems.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gomez-Uribe|first1=Carlos A.|last2=Hunt|first2=Neil|title=The Netflix Recommender System|journal=ACM Transactions on Management Information Systems|date=28 December 2015|volume=6|issue=4|pages=1\u201319|doi=10.1145/2843948|doi-access=free}}</ref> The website makes recommendations by comparing the watching and searching habits of similar users (i.e., collaborative filtering) as well as by offering movies that share characteristics with films that a user has rated highly (content-based filtering).\n\nSome hybridization techniques include:\n*'''Weighted''': Combining the score of different recommendation components numerically.\n*'''Switching''': Choosing among recommendation components and applying the selected one.\n*'''Mixed''': Recommendations from different recommenders are presented together to give the recommendation.\n*'''Feature Combination''': Features derived from different knowledge sources are combined together and given to a single recommendation algorithm.\n*'''Feature Augmentation''': Computing a feature or set of features, which is then part of the input to the next technique.\n*'''Cascade''': Recommenders are given strict priority, with the lower priority ones breaking ties in the scoring of the higher ones.\n*'''Meta-level''': One recommendation technique is applied and produces some sort of model, which is then the input used by the next technique.<ref name=hybrids>Robin Burke, [http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/~acristea/courses/CS411/2010/Book%20-%20The%20Adaptive%20Web/HybridWebRecommenderSystems.pdf Hybrid Web Recommender Systems] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140912085014/http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/~acristea/courses/CS411/2010/Book%20-%20The%20Adaptive%20Web/HybridWebRecommenderSystems.pdf |date=2014-09-12 }}, pp. 377-408, The Adaptive Web, Peter Brusilovsky, Alfred Kobsa, Wolfgang Nejdl (Ed.), Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Germany, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Vol. 4321, May 2007, 978-3-540-72078-2.</ref>\n\n== The Netflix Prize ==\n{{Main|Netflix Prize}}\n\nOne of the events that energized research in recommender systems was the [[Netflix Prize]]. From 2006 to 2009, Netflix sponsored a competition, offering a grand prize of $1,000,000 to the team that could take an offered dataset of over 100 million movie ratings and return recommendations that were 10% more accurate than those offered by the company's existing recommender system. This competition energized the search for new and more accurate algorithms. On 21 September 2009, the grand prize of US$1,000,000 was given to the BellKor's Pragmatic Chaos team using tiebreaking rules.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">{{cite news|last1=Lohr|first1=Steve|title=A $1 Million Research Bargain for Netflix, and Maybe a Model for Others|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/22/technology/internet/22netflix.html|website=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\nThe most accurate algorithm in 2007 used an ensemble method of 107 different algorithmic approaches, blended into a single prediction.

To measure the [[effectiveness]] of recommender systems, and compare different approaches, three types of [[evaluation]]s are available: user studies, [[A/B testing|online evaluations (A/B tests)]], and offline evaluations.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe commonly used metrics are the [[mean squared error]] and [[root mean squared error]], the latter having been used in the Netflix Prize. The information retrieval metrics such as [[precision and recall]] or [[Discounted Cumulative Gain|DCG]] are useful to assess the quality of a recommendation method. Diversity, novelty, and coverage are also considered as important aspects in evaluation.<ref>Lathia, N., Hailes, S., Capra, L., Amatriain, X.: [http://www.academia.edu/download/46585553/lathia_sigir10.pdf Temporal diversity in recommender systems]. In: Proceedings of the 33rd International ACMSIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, SIGIR 2010, pp. 210\u2013217. ACM, New York</ref> However, many of the classic evaluation measures are highly criticized.<ref name=\"Turpin2001\">{{cite book| author=Turpin, Andrew H, Hersh, William| chapter=Why batch and user evaluations do not give the same results| title=Proceedings of the 24th annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval| year=2001| pages=225\u2013231}}</ref>\n\nUser studies are rather small scale. A few dozens or hundreds of users are presented recommendations created by different recommendation approaches, and then the users judge which recommendations are best. In A/B tests, recommendations are shown to typically thousands of users of a real product, and the recommender system randomly picks at least two different recommendation approaches to generate recommendations. The effectiveness is measured with implicit measures of effectiveness such as [[conversion rate]] or [[click-through rate]]. Offline evaluations are based on historic data, e.g. a dataset that contains information about how users previously rated movies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/|title=MovieLens dataset|last=|first=|date=2013-09-06|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe effectiveness of recommendation approaches is then measured based on how well a recommendation approach can predict the users' ratings in the dataset. While a rating is an explicit expression of whether a user liked a movie, such information is not available in all domains. For instance, in the domain of citation recommender systems, users typically do not rate a citation or recommended article. In such cases, offline evaluations may use implicit measures of effectiveness. For instance, it may be assumed that a recommender system is effective that is able to recommend as many articles as possible that are contained in a research article's reference list.

Originally competing in blue and white striped jerseys and white shorts, they experimented with red and white stripes in the early 1900s, and from the mid-1930s to mid-1960s played in white jerseys and black shorts.<ref name=\"Our History\" /><ref name=\"Kit History\">{{cite web | url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Stockport_County/Stockport_County.htm#KitHistory | title=Kit History | publisher=historicalkits.co.uk | accessdate=8 September 2013|last=Moor|first=Dave|date=8 September 2013}}</ref> No set pattern has been established for the club's use of blue and white as main colours, as they have played at various times in a white jersey with a blue band and blue shorts and a blue jersey with white pin stripes and white shorts. They made a short experiment with an [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]]-style kit, light blue and white stripes with black shorts, after the [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978 World Cup]]. This was abandoned after the outbreak of the [[Falklands War]],<ref name=\"Background\" /> and the club returned to blue and white striped tops with blue shorts in the 1980s. Stockport marked their 125th anniversary during 2008 by bringing in a third kit \u2013 a gold colour with black trim.<ref name=\"Coca Cola League Two 2007 - 2008 Kits\">{{cite web | url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/English_Football_League/season/2007-2008/league-two.html#stockport| title=Coca Cola League Two 2007 \u2013 2008 | work=Historical Kits | accessdate=9 September 2013|last=Moor|first=Dave|date=9 September 2013}}</ref> The kit was worn on 17 occasions, all away trips.

It was altered in 2006 to resemble the town's arms more closely, including the [[Latin]] motto ''Animo et Fide'', which loosely translated, means ''With Courage and Faith''.<ref name=\"Stockport - Explanation of the Arms of Stockport\">{{cite web | url=http://www.manchester2002-uk.com/towns/stockport3.html | title=Stockport \u2013 Explanation of the Arms of Stockport | publisher=manchester2002-uk.com | accessdate=29 August 2015 | last=Moss | first=John | date=28 April 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151122022349/http://www.manchester2002-uk.com/towns/stockport3.html | archive-date=22 November 2015 | url-status=dead }}</ref> The blue shield is taken from the coat of arms of the 'de Stokeport' family, from whom Stockport derives its name.<ref name=\"Stockport - Explanation of the Arms of Stockport\" /><ref name=\"Secret Stockport\" /> The twin-towered castle above the shield is [[Stockport Castle]], which stood until 1775.<ref name=\"STOCKPORT CASTLE\">{{PastScape|mnumber=1085399 | mname=STOCKPORT CASTLE | accessdate=29 August 2015|date=29 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nAfter the completion by the 2015 Group takeover of the club, a new crest was adopted. It was still based on the [[Stockport]] coat of arms, though the ''Animo et Fide'' motto was removed, along with a patch of green at the base of the badge; the [[flag of Cheshire]], featuring a sword and three wheatsheaves, replaced the golden lozenges and crosslets in the shield. The medals hanging from the lion's rampant (which represented Cheshire and [[Lancashire]], owing to Stockport's location astride the Mersey which forms the historic border between the two counties) were removed. It also saw the return of a football on the shield. This change was made in part because as of the 2010\u201311 season, Stockport County was sponsored by the Metropolitan Borough Council.<ref name=\"Npower League Two 2010 - 2011 Kits\">{{cite web | url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/English_Football_League/season/2010-2011/league-two.html| title=Npower League Two 2010 \u2013 2011| work=Historical Kits | accessdate=9 September 2013|last=Moor|first=Dave|date=9 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe crest was altered in 2011 to re-include the town motto. The new version added two white ribbons \u2013 one at the top, with ''Animo et Fide'', and one at the bottom with ''Stockport County F.C.''. In addition, the football was again removed from the shield. The [[Stockport County Supporters' Co - Operative]] used the blue on white cross symbol from the 1978 badge as the main identifier in their company logo. Stockport's kit was supplied by local manufacturer [[Umbro]] who supplied all three kits for the 2013\u201314 season, replacing [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], thus making Stockport the only senior club in the UK to wear the Umbro strip in the 2013\u201314 season.<ref name=\"Background\" /><ref name=\"New Kit Deal Agreed\">{{cite web |

During the mid-1960s, the Football League introduced a minimum admission price for all clubs in all four divisions, attempting to help boost revenue for lower clubs. It had the desired effect only in small towns miles from big city teams. It had the opposite effect in larger places like Stockport, where lower-league clubs were in relatively close proximity to clubs in higher divisions. Stockport devised a solution, moving all their home games to Friday evening kick-offs, which generated larger crowds and extra business in surrounding pubs and restaurants. Still, during the [[1998\u201399 in English football|1998\u201399]] season, crowds averaged around 20,000 less than local rivals Manchester City, who were a division below Stockport at the time.<ref name=\"Archive : England 1998-1999\">{{cite web | url=http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm| title=Attendances \u2013 Archive : England 1998\u20131999| publisher=European Football Statistics | accessdate=15 April 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206133246/http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm |archivedate=6 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the club notably attracted a crowd of more than 20,000 for one of its tour matches in China.

They made a short experiment with an [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]]-style kit, light blue and white stripes with black shorts, after the [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978 World Cup]]. This was abandoned after the outbreak of the [[Falklands War]],<ref name=\"Background\" /> and the club returned to blue and white striped tops with blue shorts in the 1980s.

It was altered in 2006 to resemble the town's arms more closely, including the [[Latin]] motto ''Animo et Fide'', which loosely translated, means ''With Courage and Faith''.<ref name=\"Stockport - Explanation of the Arms of Stockport\">{{cite web | url=http://www.manchester2002-uk.com/towns/stockport3.html | title=Stockport \u2013 Explanation of the Arms of Stockport | publisher=manchester2002-uk.com | accessdate=29 August 2015 | last=Moss | first=John | date=28 April 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151122022349/http://www.manchester2002-uk.com/towns/stockport3.html | archive-date=22 November 2015 | url-status=dead }}</ref> The blue shield is taken from the coat of arms of the 'de Stokeport' family, from whom Stockport derives its name.<ref name=\"Stockport - Explanation of the Arms of Stockport\" /><ref name=\"Secret Stockport\" /> The twin-towered castle above the shield is [[Stockport Castle]], which stood until 1775.<ref name=\"STOCKPORT CASTLE\">{{PastScape|mnumber=1085399 | mname=STOCKPORT CASTLE | accessdate=29 August 2015|date=29 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nAfter the completion by the 2015 Group takeover of the club, a new crest was adopted. It was still based on the [[Stockport]] coat of arms, though the ''Animo et Fide'' motto was removed, along with a patch of green at the base of the badge; the [[flag of Cheshire]], featuring a sword and three wheatsheaves, replaced the golden lozenges and crosslets in the shield. The medals hanging from the lion's rampant (which represented Cheshire and [[Lancashire]], owing to Stockport's location astride the Mersey which forms the historic border between the two counties) were removed. It also saw the return of a football on the shield. This change was made in part because as of the 2010\u201311 season, Stockport County was sponsored by the Metropolitan Borough Council.<ref name=\"Npower League Two 2010 - 2011 Kits\">{{cite web | url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/English_Football_League/season/2010-2011/league-two.html| title=Npower League Two 2010 \u2013 2011| work=Historical Kits | accessdate=9 September 2013|last=Moor|first=Dave|date=9 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe crest was altered in 2011 to re-include the town motto. The new version added two white ribbons \u2013 one at the top, with ''Animo et Fide'', and one at the bottom with ''Stockport County F.C.''. In addition, the football was again removed from the shield. The [[Stockport County Supporters' Co - Operative]] used the blue on white cross symbol from the 1978 badge as the main identifier in their company logo. Stockport's kit was supplied by local manufacturer [[Umbro]] who supplied all three kits for the 2013\u201314 season, replacing [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], thus making Stockport the only senior club in the

During the mid-1960s, the Football League introduced a minimum admission price for all clubs in all four divisions, attempting to help boost revenue for lower clubs. It had the desired effect only in small towns miles from big city teams. It had the opposite effect in larger places like Stockport, where lower-league clubs were in relatively close proximity to clubs in higher divisions. Stockport devised a solution, moving all their home games to Friday evening kick-offs, which generated larger crowds and extra business in surrounding pubs and restaurants. Still, during the [[1998\u201399 in English football|1998\u201399]] season, crowds averaged around 20,000 less than local rivals Manchester City, who were a division below Stockport at the time.<ref name=\"Archive : England 1998-1999\">{{cite web | url=http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm| title=Attendances \u2013 Archive : England 1998\u20131999| publisher=European Football Statistics | accessdate=15 April 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206133246/http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm |archivedate=6 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the club notably attracted a crowd of more than 20,000 for one of its tour matches in China.
