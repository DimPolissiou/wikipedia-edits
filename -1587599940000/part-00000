The character and Azaria's portrayal of him had come under scrutiny since the [[Hari Kondabolu]] documentary ''[[The Problem with Apu]]'' released in 2017. Apu's portrayal came under scrutiny again when the Simpsons staff referenced the criticism as being too [[politically correct]] in the [[The Simpsons (season 29)|season 29]] episode \"[[No Good Read Goes Unpunished]]\" which resulted in backlash from some people concerned about the issue who felt that the response was immature. Azaria said that it was a mutual decision made between himself and the senior staff, stating, \"all we know there is I won't be doing the voice anymore, unless there's someway to transition it or something.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/apu-voice-actor/|title='The Simpsons' Star Hank Azaria Will No Longer Voice Apu [TCA 2020]|work=SlashFilm|accessdate=January 17, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Episodes==\n{{see also|List of The Simpsons episodes}}\n<onlyinclude>{{#invoke:Episode table|main\n|background = #3901A4 \n|overall    = \n|season     = \n|title      = \n|titleR     = <ref name=\"The Futon Critic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/showatch/simpsons/listings/|title=''The Simpsons'' Episode Listings|publisher=[[The Futon Critic]]}}</ref>\n|director   = \n|writer     = \n|airdate    = \n|airdateR   = <ref name=\"The Futon Critic\" />\n|prodcode   = \n|viewers    = \n|country    = U.S.\n|episodes   = \n{{#invoke:Episode list|sublist|The Simpsons (season 31)\n |EpisodeNumber   = 663\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n |Title           = [[The Winter of Our Monetized Content]]\n |DirectedBy      = [[Bob Anderson (director)|Bob Anderson]]\n |WrittenBy       = [[Ryan Koh]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|9|29}}\n |ProdCode        = YABF19\n |Viewers         = 2.33<ref name=\"31.01\">{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/sunday-final-ratings-sept-29-2019/|title='60 Minutes,' 'NCIS: Los Angeles,' and 'Sunday Night Football' adjust up: Sunday final ratings|last=Welch|first=Alex|work=TV by the Numbers|date=October 1, 2019|accessdate=October 1, 2019}}</ref>\n|ShortSummary    = [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] and [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] become viral video stars.

[[Matt Selman]] also contributed as showrunner for the episodes \"[[Go Big or Go Homer]]\", \"[[Livin' la Pura Vida]]\", \"[[Thanksgiving of Horror]]\", \"[[The Miseducation of Lisa Simpson]]\", \"[[Bart the Bad Guy]]\" and \"[[Highway to Well]]\".\n\nIt is the last season to feature the voice talents of recurring co-star [[Russi Taylor]] who died on July 26, 2019 and had been with the show since the very [[The Simpsons (season 1)|first season]] voicing characters such as [[Martin Prince]], [[Sherri and Terri]] and [[Uter|\u00dcter Z\u00f6rker]]. Taylor's characters were adopted during this season's production cycle by voice actress [[Grey Griffin]] starting with the episode \"[[Marge the Lumberjill]]\", though the last episode to feature Taylor would be \"Thanksgiving of Horror\" which aired afterwards due to being part of the [[The Simpsons (season 30)|prior season]]'s production run that was deliberately scheduled to air close to [[Thanksgiving]] 2019. \n\n==Accolades==\nIn early December 2019 it was announced that three episodes had been nominated for [[Writers Guild of America Award for Television: Animation|Writers Guild of America Award for Outstanding Writing in Animation]] for the [[Writers Guild of America Awards 2019|72nd Writers Guild of America Awards]], resulting in ''The Simpsons'' having the most nominations overall that year. The writers and episodes nominated were [[John Frink]] for \"Go Big or Go Homer,\" [[Brian Kelley (writer)|Brian Kelley]] for \"Livin\u2019 La Pura Vida\" and [[Dan Vebber]] for \"Thanksgiving of Horror\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/writers-guild-awards-2020-tv-nominations-1203426148/|title=Writers Guild Unveils 2020 TV Award Nominees|work=Variety|date=December 5, 2019|accessdate=December 5, 2019}}</ref> and on February 1, 2020, it was announced that Vebber and \"Thanksgiving of Horror\" had won.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2020/film/news/wga-awards-winners-2020-writers-guild-1203488902/|title=WGA Awards: 'Parasite,' 'Jojo Rabbit,' HBO Among Top Winners (Full List)|work=Variety|accessdate=February 1, 2020}}</ref>\n\nOnly a few days after the WGA nominees were listed, the show also received a nomination for the [[Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Animated Series]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2019/12/the-irishman-leads-2020-critics-choice-awards-nominations.html|title=Martin Scorsese's ''The Irishman'' Leads This Year's Critics' Choice Awards Nominations|work=Vulture|accessdate=December 8, 2019}}</ref> but lost to ''[[Bojack Horseman]]'' when winners were announced at the [[10th Critics' Choice Television Awards]] on January 12, 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2020/01/critics-choice-awards-2020-winners-list-1202828353/|title=Critics' Choice Awards: 'Once Upon A Time In Hollywood' Wins Best Picture, Netflix And HBO Among Top Honorees \u2013 Full Winners List|work=Deadline|accessdate=January 12, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\nThis season features the first scripts credited to writers Max Cohn and Elisabeth Kiernan Averick. Comedian and writer [[Pete Holmes]] also both wrote and guest starred in the two-part \"[[Warrin' Priests]]\" episodes, making him the third freelance writer to do so after [[Ricky Gervais]] and [[Seth Rogen]]. While in \"Warrin' Priests\" Holmes plays the character of Bode, he had previously guest starred in season 30 premiere \"[[Bart's Not Dead]]\" as a different character. The episode \"[[The Incredible Lightness of Being a Baby]]\" was delayed from the previous season, with the original intent to air it instead of \"[[I'm Just a Girl Who Can't Say D'oh]]\" on April 7, 2019. The episode was put on hold after the show's producers decided to make a short film related to the episode involving Maggie and another baby named Hudson titled ''[[Playdate with Destiny]]'' as well. The short film premiered on February 29, 2020, attached to advanced screenings of the [[Disney]]/[[Pixar]] release ''[[Onward (film)|Onward]]'' with \"The Incredible Lightness of Being a Baby\" serving as a sequel to it.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/tv/the-simpsons-short-playdate-with-destiny-onward-origins/|title=Exclusive: The story behind the secret ''Simpsons'' short heading to theaters|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=February 28, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThis season was produced and aired during the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]] which delayed or canceled the production of many television productions, but as an animated production this took less of a toll on the show than most live-action productions. Executive producer [[James L. Brooks]] encouraged the staff to begin working from their homes in early March 2020, before California's [[stay-at-home order]] was declared. In an interview with [[The Hollywood Reporter]] in late March 2020 Al Jean stated, \"Production hasn't skipped a day or lost a beat. We intend to do the 22 shows we were contracted to do... There's been no change in how we do things.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/animated-series-adapt-keep-production-going-industry-wide-shutdown-1286340|title=Animated Series Adapt to Keep Production Going Amid Industry-Wide Shutdown|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=April 22, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2020 the show joined the rest of FOX's [[Animation Domination]] lineup in a partnership with [[Caffeine (service)|Caffeine]] for the ''AniDom Beyond Show'', a recap show hosted by [[Andy Richter]]. The hour-long program featured interviews with guests and live interactivity with fans online, with recaps for the episodes that aired through April and May.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2020/04/16/fox-entertainment-and-caffeine-to-partner-on-live-sunday-night-animation-domination-branded-series-the-anidom-beyond-show-hosted-by-andy-richter-638015/20200416fox01/|title=FOX Entertainment and Caffeine to Partner on Live Sunday Night \"Animation Domination\"-Branded Series the \"AniDom Beyond Show,\" Hosted by Andy Richter||work=The Futon Critic|accessdate=April 22, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Controversy==\nIt was during the run of this season that longtime voice actor [[Hank Azaria]] announced that he was officially stepping down from voicing [[Apu Nahasapeemapetilon]], a character he had played since the episode \"[[The Telltale Head]]\" from the first season. The character and Azaria's portrayal of him had come under scrutiny since the [[Hari Kondabolu]] documentary ''[[The Problem with Apu]]'' released in 2017. Apu's portrayal came under scrutiny again when the Simpsons staff referenced the criticism as being too [[politically correct]] in the [[The Simpsons (season 29)|season 29]] episode \"[[No Good Read Goes Unpunished]]\" which resulted in backlash from some people concerned about the issue who felt that the response was immature. Azaria said that it was a mutual decision made between himself and the senior staff, stating, \"all we know there is I won't be doing the voice anymore, unless there's someway to transition it or something.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/apu-voice-actor/|title='The Simpsons' Star Hank Azaria Will No Longer Voice Apu [TCA 2020]|work=SlashFilm|accessdate=January 17, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Episodes==\n{{see also|List of The Simpsons episodes}}\n<onlyinclude>{{#invoke:Episode table|main\n|background = #3901A4 \n|overall    = \n|season     = \n|title      = \n|titleR     = <ref name=\"The Futon Critic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/showatch/simpsons/listings/|title=''The Simpsons'' Episode Listings|publisher=[[The Futon Critic]]}}</ref>\n|director   = \n|writer     = \n|airdate    = \n|airdateR   = <ref name=\"The Futon Critic\" />\n|prodcode   = \n|viewers    = \n|country    = U.S.\n|episodes   = \n{{#invoke:Episode list|sublist|The Simpsons (season 31)\n |EpisodeNumber   = 663\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n |Title           = [[The Winter of Our Monetized Content]]\n |DirectedBy      = [[Bob Anderson (director)|Bob Anderson]]\n |WrittenBy       = [[Ryan Koh]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|9|29}}\n |ProdCode        = YABF19\n |Viewers         = 2.33<ref name=\"31.01\">{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/sunday-final-ratings-sept-29-2019/|title='60 Minutes,' 'NCIS: Los Angeles,' and 'Sunday Night Football' adjust up: Sunday final ratings|last=Welch|first=Alex|work=TV by the Numbers|date=October 1, 2019|accessdate=October 1, 2019}}</ref>\n|ShortSummary    = [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] and [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] become viral video stars.

{"title_page": "Death (Tarot card)", "text_new": "{{redirect|Death card|the playing card|Ace of spades}}The Death tarot card indicates Death itself, which is riding on a pale white horse. In the hands are a black and white flag. In this tarot reading card, death is depicted as a skeleton, which shows us that skeletal bones are the only part of the living body that faces death and still survive. The protective covering, he is wearing shows that he is unbeatable and unsurmountable. And as everyone knows that nobody has yet overcame death itself. The horse of Death is shown as white, the color of clearness. Death is also seen as the purifier of the soul. In the card we can see that even the leader is bowing down to death. It shows everyone be it men, women and children.

Surrounding it are dead and dying people from all classes, including kings, bishops and commoners. The [[Rider-Waite tarot deck]] depicts the skeleton carrying a black standard emblazoned with a white flower along with the Crashing Towers from [[The Moon (Tarot card)|The Moon]] raising with [[The Sun (Tarot card)|The Sun]] setting behind them in the background.\n\nThe number 13 card shows positive meaning in reverse reading.\n\n==Interpretation==\nAccording to [[Eden Gray]] and other authors on the subject, it is unlikely that this card actually represents a physical death.

He was an enthusiastic supporter of [[Hitler]]'s [[National Socialism]], and in 1932 he published the antisemitic newspaper \"[[Der St\u00fcrmer]]\" in [[Timi\u0219oara]], an imitation of the German [[Nazi]] publication. He was married to Margaret Jung, with whom he had two children.\n\n==Life and early work==\n[[File:Karl Gustaf von M\u00f6ller.jpg|thumb|right]]\nThe von M\u00f6ller family's origins point to the [[L\u00fcneburg Heath]]. Karl von M\u00f6ller's grandfather volunteered in the [[German Campaign of 1813|Wars of Liberation]] and was disarmed in [[Sibiu]] (Transylvania). von M\u00f6ller's grandfather is also allegedly an early developer of the [[Camera]] but didn't submit the patent in time. His father came to Vienna from [[Sibiu]]. Karl von M\u00f6ller was born in Vienna, where he attended the cadet school and the war school after high school. During the First World War, he moved as a major and chief of staff of the 34th Infantry Division, Banater Division, first to the Serbian and then to the Galician front. Von M\u00f6ller led from 1916 as a lieutenant colonel and later as colonel Hungarian Infantry Regiment No. 65 on the Eastern Front. He was awarded the [[Order_of_Leopold_(Austria)|Order of Leopold]].\n\n[[File:A Young Karl Leopold von M\u00f6ller.jpg|thumb|left|Lieutenant Karl Leopold von M\u00f6ller on graduation from the Viener Neustadt Military Academy]]\n\n== Politician ==\nAfter the collapse of the Habsburg monarchy in 1918, he left the army as a colonel and went to Timi\u0219oara, where he campaigned for political and cultural equality for Romanian Germans in the field of national politics. von M\u00f6ller was May 9, 1919, co-founded the German-Swabian Cultural Association, whose chairman Johann Junker was. The executive chairman was Michael Kausch. In 1919 M\u00f6ller was elected the second mayor of Timi\u0219oara. From 1919 to 1926 he was a senator in the Romanian upper house in [[Bucharest]], representing Banat Swabia. Karl von M\u00f6ller joined the \"[[Volksgemeinschaft]]\" together with Josef Gabriel in 1920.\n\nFrom 1920 he made trips to Germany, gave lectures in Saxony, Westphalia, Baden, W\u00fcrttemberg, Thuringia, Berlin and Munich. In 1923 he had contacts with National Socialist circles; he is considered an early supporter of [[Adolf Hitler]]. After his return, he became chief editor of the \"Banat German newspaper\". He was one of the members of the \"German People's Council\".\n\nvon M\u00f6ller is considered one of the pioneers of fascism in the Banat. In 1931 he founded the first Banat local group of the \"National Socialist Self-Help Movement of the Germans in Romania\" (NSDR) in Jimbolia (German: Hatzfeld), which was supported by the ideas of the innovators. Shortly afterwards, M\u00f6ller became the first [[Gauleiter]] of the Banat in 1932 and founded the National Socialist newspaper \u201cDer St\u00fcrmer\u201d in Timi\u0219oara in the same year. In the spring of 1933, he was deposed again as Gauleiter. In the same year, he served as \"cultural office manager\" in Sibiu the \"job for ideological education and cultural policy\". After his application for admission to the [[Wehrmacht]] had been rejected because he had exceeded the entry age limit, he wrote to [https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Schworm Karl Schworm] on September 7, 1939: \"What would I be happy if fate put me at the front, regardless of whether in west or east! I can't think of a better way to end my fighting life than to end up for the leader and the empire. \u201d In 1941 he was appointed the\u201c cultural council \u201dof the German ethnic group in Romania.\n\n== Author ==\nAccording to his biography on the \"Kulturportal West-Ost\", in addition to his political \"von M\u00f6ller\" developed a lively writing activity, which was based on the great novels of [[Adam M\u00fcller-Guttenbrunn]] (1852-1923) and the intellectual and political development of Southeastern Germany, but especially the Banat Swabia, from the settlement until their ethnic awakening at the turn of the 20th century. As editor-in-chief of the 'Banater Deutsche Zeitung', he served the 'Banater Schw\u00e4bische Volksgemeinschaft'.\u201d\n\nvon M\u00f6ller's novels try to give a concrete picture of the respective events from the perspective of their time. He is one of the most popular authors of historical novels of his time, but with a nationalist and anti-Semitic touch. von M\u00f6ller began in the early 1920s with the publication ultranationalist writings. As \"advocate of folk anti-Semitism\" he wrote in his Gazette \"The Striker\". In his two-volume work \"How the Swabian communities came into being\" (Timi\u0219oara 1923\u201324), M\u00f6ller 1924 \"openly expressed his chauvinistic ideas and ideas by incorporating the 'Germanic racial element' (Vol. 2, p. 22) of the German superman into The foreground of his historical statements moved. \n\nIn the novel \u201cDie Werschetzer Tat\u201d (1936) he glorified the defence of Werschetz on the westernmost slope of the Banat Mountains at the time of the last great invasion of the Banat in 1788 by the Turks. Based on historical events, the author illustrates the rural life of German settlers of the first generation in the midst of a colourful mix of people and people. He takes on Nazi ideologies back such. B. The glorification of struggle, peasantry and leader personality, the superiority of the \" Aryan race\", inferiority, moral and physical degradation of the \"foreign people\": The Germans \"must be protected from the teeth of the strange army wolf, who runs up and down the Danube with hanging blood tongues.\"\n\nIn the novel \"Borders Wander: A Banat Roman\" (1937) von M\u00f6ller describes his life and customs of the Banat Swabians from the turn of the century about the First World War and the resulting tripartite division of the Banat in 1920 using the example of the predominantly German-inhabited place Jimbolia. The place fell to Yugoslavia after 1918 and to Romania in 1924 in exchange for Ja\u0161a Tomi\u0107. As in \"The Werschetzer act\" must also in this novel the \"Aryan\" hero \"against their racial opponent\" claim.\n\nIn the novel \"Die Salpeterer: A Freedom Struggle by German Peasants\" (1938) M\u00f6ller describes the struggle for freedom of the Hotzenwald Salpeterer in the Black Forest against the Prince-Bishop of St. Blasien and their eventual banishment to the Banat. He describes their homesickness and defiance against the injustice suffered from their point of view and only allows them to become \"real Banat farmers\" after generations. \n\nvon M\u00f6ller was very active as a writer in his last years. Above all, he published in the [[Eher-Verlag]] of the [[NSDAP]].\n\nOn October 11, 1941, the author's 65th birthday, [[Hitler_cabinet|Reich Minister]] [[Joseph Goebbels]] expressed his thanks to the nation.\n\n==Military career==\n\nAfter graduating from cadet school and from the Military Academy in [[Vienna]], he was appointed as a senior state officer{{clarify|date=September 2018}}, and served in several garrisons. In 1913 he was transferred to [[Timi\u0219oara]] where he served in the 34th Infantry Division during the 1914 campaigns in Serbia and Galicia. He was then transferred to the headquarters in Vienna. In 1916, he was promoted from [[Oberstleutnant|Lieutenant Colonel]] to Commander of the 65th Infantry Regiment of Hungary. Under his command, the 65th Infantry Regiment of Hungary fought on the eastern front, and M\u00f6ller was subsequently promoted to [[Oberst|Colonel]]. At the end of the war, the regiment suppressed the uprising of the Republicans in [[Upper Hungary]] (now [[Slovakia]]) after which it was put in reserve by the K\u00e1rolyi government.<ref>[http://hatzfeld-banat.de/index.php?option=com_content&view=section&id = 9 & Itemid = 19 Hatzfelder Pers\u00f6nlichkeiten-Schrifsteller]</ref>\n\n==Political career in Romania==\n\nPost [[World War I]], M\u00f6ller decided to stay back in Timi\u0219oara, where he joined the German Popular Movement of Banat (''Bewegung des Banater Deutschtums''), bolstering its struggle for self-affirmation. He forayed into the cultural field as a journalist{{clarify|date=September 2018}}, and later became active in politics. He held the position of editor-in-chief at ''Schw\u00e4bische Volkspresse'' (established 1921; from 1925 the ''Banat Deutsche Zeitung'') for several years, strengthening the voice of the Swabian-German community. In September 1923 Karl von M\u00f6ller actively participated in a celebration of the 200th anniversary of the migration of the Swabians organized by the Banat German Movement.\n\nIn autumn 1919 he was briefly Deputy Mayor of Timi\u0219oara, after which he was elected four times to the [[Parliament of Romania|Romanian Parliament]], in which he served between 1919 and 1927 as a representative of the Swabians in Banat. In the parliamentary debate on the [[1923 Constitution of Romania]] on March 12, 1923, he said he was speaking on behalf of the \"Banat Swabian People\", declaring the Germans' loyalty to their new homeland, but demanded that the new constitution should not jeopardize the existence of minorities from a national point of view; he said the new constitution did not include the promises made to the minorities by the Romanians in [[Union of Transylvania with Romania|Alba Iulia]].<ref>[http://www.uefromania.ro / evolution-German-from-banat-in-context-administrative-demographic-political-and-legislative-in-the-interwar period / Evolution of German education in Banat in administrative context , demographic, political and legislative in the interwar period]</ref>\n\nIn May 1920 the \"moderate\" Swabians, led by [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaspar_Muth Kaspar Muth], formed the Swabian Party of Autonomy, joined by Karl von M\u00f6ller, [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Gabriel_(Politiker,_1880) Dr Joseph Gabriel], and Peter Schiff of the National Swabian-German party.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.muzeulbanatului.ro/istorie/publicatii/analele_banatului_2008/3_6_narai.pdf | title=Muzeulbanatului.ro }}{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn 1927, M\u00f6ller withdrew from public life and settled in [[Jimbolia]], where he married Margaret Jung, the daughter of a wealthy farmer from the Banat.

M\u00f6ller, who adhered to Nazi ideology, tried to use these positions to popularise Nazism and prepare the Banat population for its adoption. This attempt was thwarted, and he lost both positions by the end of 1931.\n\nAfter 1930, and especially after 1933, the Nazi movement had achieved a strong position in Romania, capturing the leadership of the Germans in Romania. The initiator of the Nazi movement among the German minority was the reserve captain [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_Fabritius Fritz Fabritius]. From 1931, Fabritius tried to expand the movement in Banat, finding audiences in some circles of dissatisfied and young Swabians who returned from studies in Germany.

He was an enthusiastic supporter of [[Hitler]]'s [[National Socialism]], and in 1932 he published the antisemitic newspaper \"[[Der St\u00fcrmer]]\" in [[Timi\u0219oara]], an imitation of the German [[Nazi]] publication. He was married to Margaret Jung, with whom he had two children.\n\n==Life and early work==\nThe von M\u00f6ller family's origins point to the [[L\u00fcneburg Heath]]. Karl von M\u00f6ller's grandfather volunteered in the [[German Campaign of 1813|Wars of Liberation]] and was disarmed in [[Sibiu]] (Transylvania).\n[[File:Karl Gustaf von M\u00f6ller.jpg|thumb|right]]\n von M\u00f6ller's grandfather is also allegedly an early developer of the [[Camera]] but didn't submit the patent in time. His father came to Vienna from [[Sibiu]]. Karl von M\u00f6ller was born in Vienna, where he attended the cadet school and the war school after high school. During the First World War, he moved as a major and chief of staff of the 34th Infantry Division, Banater Division, first to the Serbian and then to the Galician front. Von M\u00f6ller led from 1916 as a lieutenant colonel and later as colonel Hungarian Infantry Regiment No. 65 on the Eastern Front. He was awarded the [[Order_of_Leopold_(Austria)|Order of Leopold]].\n\n[[File:A Young Karl Leopold von M\u00f6ller.jpg|thumb|left|Lieutenant Karl Leopold von M\u00f6ller on graduation from the Viener Neustadt Military Academy]]\n\n== Politician ==\nAfter the collapse of the Habsburg monarchy in 1918, he left the army as a colonel and went to Timi\u0219oara, where he campaigned for political and cultural equality for Romanian Germans in the field of national politics. von M\u00f6ller was May 9, 1919, co-founded the German-Swabian Cultural Association, whose chairman Johann Junker was. The executive chairman was Michael Kausch. In 1919 M\u00f6ller was elected the second mayor of Timi\u0219oara. From 1919 to 1926 he was a senator in the Romanian upper house in [[Bucharest]], representing Banat Swabia. Karl von M\u00f6ller joined the \"[[Volksgemeinschaft]]\" together with Josef Gabriel in 1920.\n\nFrom 1920 he made trips to Germany, gave lectures in Saxony, Westphalia, Baden, W\u00fcrttemberg, Thuringia, Berlin and Munich. In 1923 he had contacts with National Socialist circles; he is considered an early supporter of [[Adolf Hitler]]. After his return, he became chief editor of the \"Banat German newspaper\". He was one of the members of the \"German People's Council\".\n\nvon M\u00f6ller is considered one of the pioneers of fascism in the Banat. In 1931 he founded the first Banat local group of the \"National Socialist Self-Help Movement of the Germans in Romania\" (NSDR) in Jimbolia (German: Hatzfeld), which was supported by the ideas of the innovators. Shortly afterwards, M\u00f6ller became the first [[Gauleiter]] of the Banat in 1932 and founded the National Socialist newspaper \u201cDer St\u00fcrmer\u201d in Timi\u0219oara in the same year. In the spring of 1933, he was deposed again as Gauleiter. In the same year, he served as \"cultural office manager\" in Sibiu the \"job for ideological education and cultural policy\". After his application for admission to the [[Wehrmacht]] had been rejected because he had exceeded the entry age limit, he wrote to [https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Schworm Karl Schworm] on September 7, 1939: \"What would I be happy if fate put me at the front, regardless of whether in west or east! I can't think of a better way to end my fighting life than to end up for the leader and the empire. \u201d In 1941 he was appointed the\u201c cultural council \u201dof the German ethnic group in Romania.\n\n== Author ==\nAccording to his biography on the \"Kulturportal West-Ost\", in addition to his political \"von M\u00f6ller\" developed a lively writing activity, which was based on the great novels of [[Adam M\u00fcller-Guttenbrunn]] (1852-1923) and the intellectual and political development of Southeastern Germany, but especially the Banat Swabia, from the settlement until their ethnic awakening at the turn of the 20th century. As editor-in-chief of the 'Banater Deutsche Zeitung', he served the 'Banater Schw\u00e4bische Volksgemeinschaft'.\u201d\n\nvon M\u00f6ller's novels try to give a concrete picture of the respective events from the perspective of their time. He is one of the most popular authors of historical novels of his time, but with a nationalist and anti-Semitic touch. von M\u00f6ller began in the early 1920s with the publication ultranationalist writings. As \"advocate of folk anti-Semitism\" he wrote in his Gazette \"The Striker\". In his two-volume work \"How the Swabian communities came into being\" (Timi\u0219oara 1923\u201324), M\u00f6ller 1924 \"openly expressed his chauvinistic ideas and ideas by incorporating the 'Germanic racial element' (Vol. 2, p. 22) of the German superman into The foreground of his historical statements moved. \n\nIn the novel \u201cDie Werschetzer Tat\u201d (1936) he glorified the defence of Werschetz on the westernmost slope of the Banat Mountains at the time of the last great invasion of the Banat in 1788 by the Turks. Based on historical events, the author illustrates the rural life of German settlers of the first generation in the midst of a colourful mix of people and people. He takes on Nazi ideologies back such. B. The glorification of struggle, peasantry and leader personality, the superiority of the \" Aryan race\", inferiority, moral and physical degradation of the \"foreign people\": The Germans \"must be protected from the teeth of the strange army wolf, who runs up and down the Danube with hanging blood tongues.\"\n\nIn the novel \"Borders Wander: A Banat Roman\" (1937) von M\u00f6ller describes his life and customs of the Banat Swabians from the turn of the century about the First World War and the resulting tripartite division of the Banat in 1920 using the example of the predominantly German-inhabited place Jimbolia. The place fell to Yugoslavia after 1918 and to Romania in 1924 in exchange for Ja\u0161a Tomi\u0107. As in \"The Werschetzer act\" must also in this novel the \"Aryan\" hero \"against their racial opponent\" claim.\n\nIn the novel \"Die Salpeterer: A Freedom Struggle by German Peasants\" (1938) M\u00f6ller describes the struggle for freedom of the Hotzenwald Salpeterer in the Black Forest against the Prince-Bishop of St. Blasien and their eventual banishment to the Banat. He describes their homesickness and defiance against the injustice suffered from their point of view and only allows them to become \"real Banat farmers\" after generations. \n\nvon M\u00f6ller was very active as a writer in his last years. Above all, he published in the [[Eher-Verlag]] of the [[NSDAP]].\n\nOn October 11, 1941, the author's 65th birthday, [[Hitler_cabinet|Reich Minister]] [[Joseph Goebbels]] expressed his thanks to the nation.\n\n==Military career==\n\nAfter graduating from cadet school and from the Military Academy in [[Vienna]], he was appointed as a senior state officer{{clarify|date=September 2018}}, and served in several garrisons. In 1913 he was transferred to [[Timi\u0219oara]] where he served in the 34th Infantry Division during the 1914 campaigns in Serbia and Galicia. He was then transferred to the headquarters in Vienna. In 1916, he was promoted from [[Oberstleutnant|Lieutenant Colonel]] to Commander of the 65th Infantry Regiment of Hungary. Under his command, the 65th Infantry Regiment of Hungary fought on the eastern front, and M\u00f6ller was subsequently promoted to [[Oberst|Colonel]]. At the end of the war, the regiment suppressed the uprising of the Republicans in [[Upper Hungary]] (now [[Slovakia]]) after which it was put in reserve by the K\u00e1rolyi government.<ref>[http://hatzfeld-banat.de/index.php?option=com_content&view=section&id = 9 & Itemid = 19 Hatzfelder Pers\u00f6nlichkeiten-Schrifsteller]</ref>\n\n==Political career in Romania==\n\nPost [[World War I]], M\u00f6ller decided to stay back in Timi\u0219oara, where he joined the German Popular Movement of Banat (''Bewegung des Banater Deutschtums''), bolstering its struggle for self-affirmation. He forayed into the cultural field as a journalist{{clarify|date=September 2018}}, and later became active in politics. He held the position of editor-in-chief at ''Schw\u00e4bische Volkspresse'' (established 1921; from 1925 the ''Banat Deutsche Zeitung'') for several years, strengthening the voice of the Swabian-German community. In September 1923 Karl von M\u00f6ller actively participated in a celebration of the 200th anniversary of the migration of the Swabians organized by the Banat German Movement.\n\nIn autumn 1919 he was briefly Deputy Mayor of Timi\u0219oara, after which he was elected four times to the [[Parliament of Romania|Romanian Parliament]], in which he served between 1919 and 1927 as a representative of the Swabians in Banat. In the parliamentary debate on the [[1923 Constitution of Romania]] on March 12, 1923, he said he was speaking on behalf of the \"Banat Swabian People\", declaring the Germans' loyalty to their new homeland, but demanded that the new constitution should not jeopardize the existence of minorities from a national point of view; he said the new constitution did not include the promises made to the minorities by the Romanians in [[Union of Transylvania with Romania|Alba Iulia]].<ref>[http://www.uefromania.ro / evolution-German-from-banat-in-context-administrative-demographic-political-and-legislative-in-the-interwar period / Evolution of German education in Banat in administrative context , demographic, political and legislative in the interwar period]</ref>\n\nIn May 1920 the \"moderate\" Swabians, led by [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaspar_Muth Kaspar Muth], formed the Swabian Party of Autonomy, joined by Karl von M\u00f6ller, [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Gabriel_(Politiker,_1880) Dr Joseph Gabriel], and Peter Schiff of the National Swabian-German party.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.muzeulbanatului.ro/istorie/publicatii/analele_banatului_2008/3_6_narai.pdf | title=Muzeulbanatului.ro }}{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn 1927, M\u00f6ller withdrew from public life and settled in [[Jimbolia]], where he married Margaret Jung, the daughter of a wealthy farmer from the Banat.

This attempt was thwarted, and he lost both positions by the end of 1931.\n\nAfter 1930, and especially after 1933, the Nazi movement had achieved a strong position in Romania, capturing the leadership of the Germans in Romania.
