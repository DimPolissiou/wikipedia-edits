Originally, the city of Bilbao comprised the Old Town and some houses on the left side of the estuary, today known as [[Bilbao la Vieja]]. The first expansion included the annexation of the elizate of [[Bego\u00f1a]] and the river side of [[Uribarri]]. In the 19th century the merge of [[Abando]] into the city brought along small neighbourhoods of farm houses and hamlets that were clustered close to the former municipality's town hall and the [[Mount Cobetas]], such as [[Errekalde]] and [[Basurto-Zorroza|Basurto]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Gonz\u00e1lez|first1=Santiago |title=Una expansi\u00f3n organizada |url= http://www.periodistasvascos.com/imagenes/cap_4.pdf|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080724095306/http://www.periodistasvascos.com/imagenes/cap_4.pdf|url-status= dead|archive-date= 24 July 2008|journal=Bilbao 700 |pages=120 |access-date=16 October 2008}}</ref> Starting in the 20th century it started annexing the elizates on the right bank of the river, including Bego\u00f1a and [[Deusto]].

The city lies on two international roads, the [[European route E70]] that follows the coast of the [[Bay of Biscay]] and the cities of [[Santander, Spain|Santander]] and [[Gij\u00f3n]] to the west and with [[Eibar]], [[San Sebasti\u00e1n]] and [[Bordeaux]] to the east. The [[European route E80]] connects the city with inner Spain to the south, including [[Burgos]] and [[Salamanca]] and continuing to [[Lisbon]], and [[Toulouse]] to the north. The [[Autopista AP-68|AP-68]] motorway (European road E-804) starts in the city, joining with [[Vitoria-Gasteiz]], [[Logro\u00f1o]] and ending in [[Zaragoza]].\n\nThe city is connected with the regions of [[Cantabria]], Asturias and [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] via the [[Autov\u00eda A-8|A-8]] motorway and with [[Durango, Biscay|Durango]], Eibar, San Sebasti\u00e1n and the French border via the [[Autopista AP-8|AP-8]] motorway, which is a toll road. The AP-68 toll motorway to the south is the main road connecting Bilbao with southern Spain and the Mediterranean coast, connecting in [[Miranda de Ebro]] with the [[Autov\u00eda A-1|A-1]] to [[Madrid]] and in Zaragoza with the [[Autopista AP-2|AP-2]] to [[Barcelona]].\n\nMinor roads passing through Bilbao or starting in the city itself include the national road [[N-634 road (Spain)|N-634]] which connects San Sebasti\u00e1n with [[Santiago de Compostela]] and runs parallel to the A-8 and AP-8 motorways. The regional road BI-631 connects Bilbao with [[Bermeo]], while the BI-626 joins the city with [[Balmaseda]]. The city is circled by the BI-625 and N-637 roads, which form a half-ring to the east, and the N-634 and A-8 to the west.\n\nThe city's main arteries the [[Gran V\u00eda de Don Diego L\u00f3pez de Haro]], which crosses the financial and business district of [[Abando]] and connecting it with the [[Casco Viejo]] to the east and the San Mam\u00e9s area to the west. The Sabino Arana Avenue and Juan Antonio Zunzunegui Avenue provide a direct route between the central districts and the motorways while Autonom\u00eda Street joins the southern districts on an east-west direction. The city has 14 bridges connecting opposite sides of the [[Estuary of Bilbao]] and the [[Cadagua|Kadagua]] river, including the [[La Salve]] and Euskalduna bridges, as well a series of tunnels under the [[Mount Artxanda]].\n\n=== Airports ===\n[[File:Aeropuerto Bilbao Loiu 01.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bilbao Airport]]]]\nBilbao is served by the [[Bilbao Airport]] (BIO), the busiest terminal in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] and in the entire Northern coast, with more than 5.4&nbsp;million passengers in 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aena.es/csee/ccurl/792/416/Informe2018_provisionales.pdf|title=Tr\u00e1fico de pasajeros, operaciones y carga en los aeropuertos espa\u00f1oles|year=2018|publisher=[[Aena]]|accessdate=24 May 2019}}</ref> It is located {{convert|12|km|2|abbr=on}} north of the borough, between the municipalities of [[Loiu]] and [[Sondika]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aena.es/csee/Satellite?Language=ES_ES&pagename=subHome&MO=1&SMO=1&SiteName=BIO&c=Page&cid=1047658432537 |title=C\u00f3mo llegar |editor=[[Aena]] |accessdate=22 October 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922012153/http://www.aena.es/csee/Satellite?cid=1047658432537&pagename=subHome&Language=ES_ES&SMO=1&SiteName=BIO&c=Page&MO=1 |archivedate=22 September 2008  }}</ref> 20 airlines operate in the terminal, including [[Iberia]], [[Lufthansa]], and [[TAP Portugal]].

The city has four railway stations: the [[Bilbao-Abando railway station|Bilbao-Abando]] and [[Bilbao Concordia|Bilbao-Concordia]] railway stations are owned by [[Adif]] and operated by the Spanish railways [[Renfe Operadora|Renfe]], whereas the [[Bilbao-Atxuri Station|Bilbao-Atxuri]] and [[Zazpikaleak/Casco Viejo]] stations are owned by the Basque railway network ETS and operated by the [[Eusko Trenbideak \u2013 Ferrocarriles Vascos|Basque railways]], serving short-distance local destinations.\n\nThe Bilbao-Abando station is the main railway station of the city, with Renfe running [[Iberian-gauge railways|Iberian-gauge]] long-distance [[Alvia]] trains to [[Madrid]] and [[Barcelona]], as well as Intercity services to [[Vigo]] with connections possible to [[A Coru\u00f1a]] and [[Hendaye]]. During the summer there are special trains to [[Malaga]]. The city will be connected to the [[Basque Y]] high-speed train network around 2023, allowing for high speed [[AVE]] trains to operate between the Basque capitals and also to Madrid and other Spanish cities in the future.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=The new stations in Bilbao and Vitoria will be defined by the end of the year |url=http://www.elcorreo.com/sociedad/nuevas-estaciones-bilbao-20171030182922-nt.html |work=El Correo |date=30 October 2017 |access-date=11 September 2018}}</ref> The arrival of the new high speed services will involve the creation of a completely new underground station that will replace the current infrastructure.

Renfe runs frequent regional trains to the cities of [[Santander, Spain|Santander]] and [[Le\u00f3n, Spain|Le\u00f3n]]. [[Euskotren Trena]] runs regular services to [[Bermeo]] from the Bilbao-Atxuri station, while in the Zazpikaleak/Casco Viejo station there are regional services to Durango, Eibar and San Sebasti\u00e1n.\n\n=== Public transport ===\n[[File:Bilbao Metro 05 2012 2406.jpg|thumb|right|Abando station of [[Metro Bilbao]].]]\n[[File:Bilbao Metro 05 2012 2111.jpg|thumb|Metro entrance in Moyua, called ''fosteritos'' for Norman Foster.]]\nPublic transport by rail and bus is organised by the ''Bizkaiko Garraio Partzuergoa'' (Consortium of the Biscayan Transport). The consortium manages the [[Barik card]], a form of [[electronic ticket]] valid across almost all public transport systems of the [[Bilbao metropolitan area]] and [[Biscay]] province, as well as some other selected services in other provinces of the Basque autonomous community.\n\nThe mass transit rail system is divided into different networks managed by separate operators. [[Metro Bilbao]], established in 1995, operates two underground lines with some overground sections ([[Line 1 (Metro Bilbao)|Line 1]] and [[Line 2 (Metro Bilbao)|Line 2]]). These two lines connect the metropolitan area following the estuary on both sides, starting in [[Etxebarri]] in the south all the way to [[Plentzia]] and [[Santurtzi]] by the coast. Line 1 was built following largely the same route as the Bilbao-Las Arenas railway, which was still active by the time the Metro system opened in 1995 and since has been replaced by it. The metro system stations were designed by [[Norman Foster]]. Line 3 of metro is operated by [[Euskotren Trena]], which also operates the regional services to Durango and Eibar as well as a commuter rail line that connects the centre of Bilbao with [[Lezama]] and the Txorierri valley. This third line of metro was inaugurated on 8 April 2017 and is expected to be extended to the [[Bilbao Airport|airport]] in the near future. Projects for a fourth and fifth line exist and are currently being studied.\n\nEuskotren also operates a tramway line under the brand [[Euskotren Tranbia]]. The line follows the estuary of Bilbao across the central districts of the city, starting in the [[Bilbao-Atxuri Station]] and connecting important areas like the Guggenheim museum and the San Mam\u00e9s football stadium. The original tram network started operations in 1876 and gradually expanded across the city to finally shut down in the 1960s due to being largely replaced by urban buses. The new tram system was opened on 18 December 2002, almost forty years after the closing of the original system.\n\n[[Renfe Operadora|Renfe]] operates four commuter-rail lines in a system separate from the metro. Three of them operate under the [[Cercan\u00edas]] brand and are collectively known as ''[[Cercan\u00edas Bilbao]]'', while a fourth line is operated by Renfe Feve. The three lines operated under the Cercan\u00edas name operate largely overground and travel larger distances than the metro system, reaching municipalities outside of the metropolitan area such as [[Muskiz]] or even outside of the Biscay province, like [[Amurrio]]. The three lines all start in the [[Bilbao-Abando railway station]], whereas the line operated by Renfe Feve starts in the Bilbao-Concordia station.\n\nThe gaps in the railway service are covered by an extensive bus network. The urban bus system is operated under the brand [[Bilbobus]] and has 28 regular bus lines, 8 microbus lines and 8 night buses collectively known as ''Gautxori'' (night owl). The Bilbaobus network is limited to the city limits, and only a few lines extend beyond it. The [[BizkaiBus]] network fills this gap, with more than 100 lines, connecting the city with all other municipalities in the metropolitan area, as well as with most towns in [[Biscay]] and some in [[\u00c1lava]].\n\nA [[Brittany Ferries]] ferry service links Santurtzi, near Bilbao, to [[Portsmouth]] (UK). [[MV Cap Finist\u00e8re]] ferry departs from the [[port of Bilbao]], {{convert|15|km|0|abbr=on}} north west of the town centre. A service operated by [[Trasmediterranea|Acciona Trasmediterranea]] served the same route from 16 May 2006 until April 2007. [[P&O Ferries]] operated this route until its withdrawal on 28 September 2010 with a ship called the [[Pride of Bilbao]].\n\n===Public transportation statistics===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Bilbao, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 35 min. 3% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 7 min, while 4% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 6.9&nbsp;km, while 10% travel for over 12&nbsp;km in a single direction.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://moovitapp.com/insights/en/Moovit_Insights_Public_Transit_Index_Spain_Bilbao-1505|title=Bilbao Public Transportation Statistics|publisher=Global Public Transit Index by Moovit|accessdate=19 June 2017}} [[File:CC-BY_icon.svg|50x50px]] Material was copied from this source, which is available under a [[creativecommons:by/4.0/|Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License]].</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n=== Healthcare ===\n[[File:Bilbao - Hospital Universitario de Basurto 10.jpg|thumb|right|University Hospital of Basurto.]]\nThe public healthcare system is served and managed by the Basque healthcare system (''[[Osakidetza]]''), which has a network of medican centres established across the city. The most relevant hospital of the city is the Basurto Hospital, located in the [[Basurto-Zorroza]] district. It was opened in 1908 after ten years of construction, and it was built due to the fast increase of population in the late 19th century. Its design was based on the [[University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf|Eppendorf Hospital]] of [[Hamburg]], in (Germany), one of the most modern at the time.<ref>{{cite news |last=Gonz\u00e1lez |first=Carlos |title=A Hundred Years of the Basurto Hospital |url=http://servicios.elcorreodigital.com/aniversario/hospital-basurto/historia.html |work=El Correo Digital |access-date=2 December 2008}}</ref> In 2008 the hospital was named the best hospital in customer support in Spain.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Basurto wins the award of best hospital in customer care |url=http://www.deia.com/es/digital/bizkaia/2008/11/11/514635.php|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124075612/http://www.deia.com/es/digital/bizkaia/2008/11/11/514635.php|url-status=dead|archive-date=24 January 2009|work=Deia|date=11 November 2008 |access-date=9 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the two largest hospitals that provide healthcare services to the inhabitants of the city are located outside of the city limits: the University Hospital of Gurutzeta/Cruces in neighboring [[Barakaldo]] and the Galdakao-Usansolo Hospital in [[Galdakao]].

The company was created in 1992 after the merging of ''Iberduero'' and ''Hidroel\u00e9ctrica Espa\u00f1ola'' and it is in charge of production and distribution of electricity. There are two [[thermal power station]]s located in the city's surroundings, one in [[Santurtzi]] and the other in [[Zierbena]]. The electricity produced in both these stations is then transferred to the [[electrical substation]] of [[G\u00fce\u00f1es]] by the company ''[[Red El\u00e9ctrica de Espa\u00f1a]]'', which is the company responsible of moving electricity from the production stations to the final consumers. There is a [[combined cycle]] power station in the municipality of [[Amorebieta-Etxano|Amorebieta]] called ''Bizkaia Energia'', whose energy is transferred to the substation of [[Gatika]].\n\nThe supply of all oil-based fuels distributed in the whole metropolitan area (gasoline, [[diesel fuel]] and [[butane]]) are produced in the [[oil refinery]] owned by ''[[Petronor]]'' in the municipalities of [[Muskiz]] and [[Abanto y Ci\u00e9rbana-Abanto Zierbena|Abanto Zierbena]]. ''Petronor'' is a large oil company founded in Bilbao in 1968 and it currently comprises two partners, [[Repsol]] (85.98%) and [[Kutxabank]] (14.02%).\n\nSupply of [[drinking water]] is managed by the ''Consorcio de Aguas Bilbao Bizkaia'' (Bilbao Bizkaia Water Consortium), a public entity wuth the responsibility of managing the water infrastructure and distribution to many Biscayan municipalities, Bilbao and its metropolitan area included.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.consorciodeaguas.eus/Web/QuienesSomos/competencias.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171120021832/http://www.consorciodeaguas.eus/Web/QuienesSomos/competencias.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-date=2017-11-20 |title=Consorcio de Aguas Bilbao Bizkaia |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=n.d. |website=Consorcio de Aguas |publisher=Consorcio de Aguas Bilbao Bizkaia |access-date=16 September 2018 }}</ref> The supply of drinking water for the city comes from the [[Reservoir of Ull\u00edbarri-Gamboa|Uribarri-Ganboa]] and Urrunaga reservoirs, which are fed by the river [[Zadorra]].\n{{clear}}\n\n==Education==\n[[File:Universidad de Deusto.jpg|thumb|The main building of the [[University of Deusto]]]]\nThe Basque Country has a bilingual education system, with students able to choose between four linguistic models: A, B, D, and X, which differ in the prevalence of Basque or Spanish as the spoken and written language used in classes.<ref name=\"cenoz\">{{cite book | url = https://archive.org/details/englishineuropea00jaso | url-access = registration | quote = basque linguistic model. | title = English in Europe: the acquisition of a third language | last = Cenoz | first = Jasone |author2=Jessner, Ulrike | publisher = Multilingual Matters | year = 2000 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/englishineuropea00jaso/page/180 180]\u2013181 | isbn = 9781853594793}}</ref> In Bilbao, there is a prevalence of model D (where Basque is the vehicle language and Spanish is taught as a subject) in [[Education in Spain#Primary school|Primary School]], while [[Education in Spain#Compulsory Secondary Education (ESO)|Compulsory Secondary Education]] students favour model B (where some subjects are in Basque and other in Spanish).

For the most part Bilbao shares its original gastronomy with that of the province of [[Biscay]], including dishes such as ''bacalao al pil pil'' (cod fish cooked with olive oil, garlic and guindilla peppers), ''bacalao a la vizca\u00edna'' (salted cod with Biscayan sauce, mostly made of ''choricero'' peppers and onions), ''merluza en salsa verde'' (hake fish with [[green sauce]]), ''chipirones en su tinta'' ([[Squid as food|squid]] served with [[Cephalopod ink|its own ink]]), ''morros a la vizca\u00edna'' (beef snouts with Biscayan sauce), ''revuelto de perretxikos'' (scrambled eggs with mushrooms) and desserts such as ''canutillos de Bilbao'' (puff pastries filled with custard or chocolate), ''[[Pantxineta]]'' (puff pastries filled with custard and almonds), [[rice cake]]s and ''bollos de mantequilla'' (butter buns).\n\nBilbao, as other [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque]] cities, is known for a variety of appetizers and snacks, being prominent among them the ''[[Pincho|pintxos]]'', which are typically eaten in bars and that consist of small slices of bread on top of which is placed an ingredient or mixture of ingredients, generally of many different types and usually including elements typical of Basque cuisine. Other snacks include ''rabas'' (fried or battered calamari rings, usually served with lemon slices), [[Spanish omelette]] (omelette made with eggs and potatoes, sometimes including onions and peppers), ''txampis'' (stuffed mushrooms), ''tri\u00e1ngulos'' (Bilbao-style sandwiches),<ref>{{cite news |last=Basabe |first=Nere |date=27 November 2013 |title=Culto a los tri\u00e1ngulos de Bilbao |url=https://elviajero.elpais.com/elviajero/2013/11/19/actualidad/1384888329_411290.html |work=El Pa\u00eds |access-date=9 September 2018}}</ref> ''gildas'' (one or more olives, a ''guindilla'' pepper and an anchovy joined together with a toothpick).\n\nIn what refers to beverages, typical from the region is the ''[[txakoli]]'', a [[white wine]] usually drunk as an [[Ap\u00e9ritif and digestif|ap\u00e9ritif]]. Biscayan ''txakoli'' (''[[Bizkaiko Txakolina]]'') is a protected ''[[Denominaci\u00f3n de origen]]'' for the white wine produced in the province of Biscay and it is usually served in Bilbao. Also typical are [[cider]], ''[[patxaran]]'' ([[sloe]]-flavoured liqueur) and [[Rioja (wine)|''Rioja'' wine]].\n\nThere are many restaurants and bars who serve these dishes and beverages, especially around the [[Casco Viejo]] quarter. ''[[Txoko]]s'' are also a very popular institution in Bilbao, as in other Basque cities and towns. Bilbao, and the province of Biscay as a whole, is one of the spanish cities with a greater number of recognized restaurants by the gastronomic guides, among them several Michelin-starred restaurants.\n\n=== Language ===\n\nThe Spanish language is the most used language of the city, followed by the [[Basque language]], which is vernacular to the region. The presence of Basque in the city is less prominent than in other municipalities of the region, such as [[Bermeo]] or [[Lekeitio]]. In 1986, the bilingual Basque-speaking population represented about 28% of the total.

Bilbao is connected to three major motorways and a series of minor roads of national and provincial level. The city lies on two international roads, the [[European route E70]] that follows the coast of the [[Bay of Biscay]] and the cities of [[Santander, Spain|Santander]] and [[Gij\u00f3n]] to the west and with [[Eibar]], [[San Sebasti\u00e1n]] and [[Bordeaux]] to the east. The [[European route E80]] connects the city with inner Spain to the south, including [[Burgos]] and [[Salamanca]] and continuing to [[Lisbon]], and [[Toulouse]] to the north. The [[Autopista AP-68|AP-68]] motorway (European road E-804) starts in the city, joining with [[Vitoria-Gasteiz]], [[Logro\u00f1o]] and ending in [[Zaragoza]].\n\nThe city is connected with the regions of [[Cantabria]], Asturias and [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] via the [[Autov\u00eda A-8|A-8]] motorway and with [[Durango, Biscay|Durango]], Eibar, San Sebasti\u00e1n and the French border via the [[Autopista AP-8|AP-8]] motorway, which is a toll road. The AP-68 toll motorway to the south is the main road connecting Bilbao with southern Spain and the Mediterranean coast, connecting in [[Miranda de Ebro]] with the [[Autov\u00eda A-1|A-1]] to [[Madrid]] and in Zaragoza with the [[Autopista AP-2|AP-2]] to [[Barcelona]].\n\nMinor roads passing through Bilbao or starting in the city itself include the national road [[N-634 road (Spain)|N-634]] which connects San Sebasti\u00e1n with [[Santiago de Compostela]] and runs parallel to the A-8 and AP-8 motorways. The regional road BI-631 connects Bilbao with [[Bermeo]], while the BI-626 joins the city with [[Balmaseda]]. The city is circled by the BI-625 and N-637 roads, which form a half-ring to the east, and the N-634 and A-8 to the west.\n\nThe city's main arteries the [[Gran V\u00eda de Don Diego L\u00f3pez de Haro]], which crosses the financial and business district of [[Abando]] and connecting it with the [[Casco Viejo]] to the east and the San Mam\u00e9s area to the west. The Sabino Arana Avenue and Juan Antonio Zunzunegui Avenue provide a direct route between the central districts and the motorways while Autonom\u00eda Street joins the southern districts on an east-west direction. The city has 14 bridges connecting opposite sides of the [[Estuary of Bilbao]] and the [[Cadagua|Kadagua]] river, including the [[La Salve]] and Euskalduna bridges, as well a series of tunnels under the [[Mount Artxanda]].\n\n=== Airports ===\n[[File:Aeropuerto Bilbao Loiu 01.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bilbao Airport]]]]\nBilbao is served by the [[Bilbao Airport]] (BIO), the busiest terminal in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] and in the entire Northern coast, with more than 5.4&nbsp;million passengers in 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aena.es/csee/ccurl/792/416/Informe2018_provisionales.pdf|title=Tr\u00e1fico de pasajeros, operaciones y carga en los aeropuertos espa\u00f1oles|year=2018|publisher=[[Aena]]|accessdate=24 May 2019}}</ref> It is located {{convert|12|km|2|abbr=on}} north of the borough, between the municipalities of [[Loiu]] and [[Sondika]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aena.es/csee/Satellite?Language=ES_ES&pagename=subHome&MO=1&SMO=1&SiteName=BIO&c=Page&cid=1047658432537 |title=C\u00f3mo llegar |editor=[[Aena]] |accessdate=22 October 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922012153/http://www.aena.es/csee/Satellite?cid=1047658432537&pagename=subHome&Language=ES_ES&SMO=1&SiteName=BIO&c=Page&MO=1 |archivedate=22 September 2008  }}</ref> 20 airlines operate in the terminal, including [[Iberia]], [[Lufthansa]], and [[TAP Portugal]].

Renfe runs frequent regional trains to the cities of [[Santander, Spain|Santander]] and [[Le\u00f3n, Spain|Le\u00f3n]]. [[Euskotren Trena]] runs regular services to [[Bermeo]] from the Bilbao-Atxuri station, while in the Zazpikaleak/Casco Viejo station there are regional services to Durango, Eibar and San Sebasti\u00e1n.\n\n=== Public transport ===\n[[File:Bilbao Metro 05 2012 2406.jpg|thumb|right|Abando station of [[Metro Bilbao]].]]\n[[File:Bilbao Metro 05 2012 2111.jpg|thumb|Metro entrance in Moyua, called ''fosteritos'' for Norman Foster.]]\nPublic transport by rail and bus is organised by the ''Bizkaiko Garraio Partzuergoa'' (Consortium of the Biscayan Transport). The consortium manages the [[Barik card]], a form of [[electronic ticket]] valid across almost all public transport systems of the [[Bilbao metropolitan area]] and [[Biscay]] province, as well as some other selected services in other provinces of the Basque autonomous community.\n\nThe mass transit rail system is divided into different networks managed by separate operators. [[Metro Bilbao]], established in 1995, operates two underground lines with some overground sections ([[Line 1 (Metro Bilbao)|Line 1]] and [[Line 2 (Metro Bilbao)|Line 2]]). These two lines connect the metropolitan area following the estuary on both sides, starting in [[Etxebarri]] in the south all the way to [[Plentzia]] and [[Santurtzi]] by the coast. Line 1 was built following largely the same route as the Bilbao-Las Arenas railway, which was still active by the time the Metro system opened in 1995 and since has been replaced by it. The metro system stations were designed by [[Norman Foster]]. Line 3 of metro is operated by [[Euskotren Trena]], which also operates the regional services to Durango and Eibar as well as a commuter rail line that connects the centre of Bilbao with [[Lezama]] and the Txorierri valley. This third line of metro was inaugurated on 8 April 2017 and is expected to be extended to the [[Bilbao Airport|airport]] in the near future. Projects for a fourth and fifth line exist and are currently being studied.\n\nEuskotren also operates a tramway line under the brand [[Euskotren Tranbia]]. The line follows the estuary of Bilbao across the central districts of the city, starting in the [[Bilbao-Atxuri Station]] and connecting important areas like the Guggenheim museum and the San Mam\u00e9s football stadium. The original tram network started operations in 1876 and gradually expanded across the city to finally shut down in the 1960s due to being largely replaced by urban buses. The new tram system was opened on 18 December 2002, almost forty years after the closing of the original system.\n\n[[Renfe Operadora|Renfe]] operates four commuter-rail lines in a system separate from the metro. Three of them operate under the [[Cercan\u00edas]] brand and are collectively known as ''[[Cercan\u00edas Bilbao]]'', while a fourth line is operated by Renfe Feve. The three lines operated under the Cercan\u00edas name operate largely overground and travel larger distances than the metro system, reaching municipalities outside of the metropolitan area such as [[Muskiz]] or even outside of the Biscay province, like [[Amurrio]]. The three lines all start in the [[Bilbao-Abando railway station]], whereas the line operated by Renfe Feve starts in the Bilbao-Concordia station.\n\nThe gaps in the railway service are covered by an extensive bus network. The urban bus system is operated under the brand [[Bilbobus]] and has 28 regular bus lines, 8 microbus lines and 8 night buses collectively known as ''Gautxori'' (night owl). The Bilbaobus network is limited to the city limits, and only a few lines extend beyond it. The [[BizkaiBus]] network fills this gap, with more than 100 lines, connecting the city with all other municipalities in the metropolitan area, as well as with most towns in [[Biscay]] and some in [[\u00c1lava]].\n\nA [[Brittany Ferries]] ferry service links Santurtzi, near Bilbao, to [[Portsmouth]] (UK). [[MV Cap Finist\u00e8re]] ferry departs from the [[port of Bilbao]], {{convert|15|km|0|abbr=on}} north west of the town centre. A service operated by [[Trasmediterranea|Acciona Trasmediterranea]] served the same route from 16 May 2006 until April 2007. [[P&O Ferries]] operated this route until its withdrawal on 28 September 2010 with a ship called the [[Pride of Bilbao]].\n\n===Public transportation statistics===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Bilbao, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 35 min. 3% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 7 min, while 4% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 6.9&nbsp;km, while 10% travel for over 12&nbsp;km in a single direction.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://moovitapp.com/insights/en/Moovit_Insights_Public_Transit_Index_Spain_Bilbao-1505|title=Bilbao Public Transportation Statistics|publisher=Global Public Transit Index by Moovit|accessdate=19 June 2017}} [[File:CC-BY_icon.svg|50x50px]] Material was copied from this source, which is available under a [[creativecommons:by/4.0/|Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License]].</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n=== Healthcare ===\n[[File:Bilbao - Hospital Universitario de Basurto 10.jpg|thumb|right|University Hospital of Basurto.]]\nThe public healthcare system is served and managed by the Basque healthcare system (''[[Osakidetza]]''), which has a network of medican centres established across the city. The most relevant hospital of the city is the Basurto Hospital, located in the [[Basurto-Zorroza]] district. It was opened in 1908 after ten years of construction, and it was built due to the fast increase of population in the late 19th century.
