It is located on the shore of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] near the foot of the [[Atlas Mountains]], just north of the point where the [[Sous River|Souss River]] flows into the ocean and {{convert|316|mi|km|order=flip}} south of [[Casablanca]]. Agadir is the capital of the [[Agadir-Ida Ou Tanane Prefecture|Agadir Ida-U-Tanan Prefecture]] and of the [[Souss-Massa]] economic region. The majority of its inhabitants speak [[Shilha language|Amazigh]] language, one of the two official languages of Morocco.\n\n==Introduction==\nAgadir is one of the major urban centres of Morocco. The municipality of Agadir recorded a population of 421,844 in the [[2014 Moroccan census]].<ref name=census2014/> According to the 2004 census, there were 346,106 inhabitants in that year<ref name=\"RGHP\">[http://www.lavieeco.com/documents_officiels/Recensement%20population.pdf General Census of the population and habitat 2004, Commisariat of Planning,  Website: www.lavieeco.com, consulted on 7 February 2012 {{in lang|fr}}]    {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724191316/http://www.lavieeco.com/documents_officiels/Recensement%20population.pdf |date=24 July 2012 }} {{in lang|ar}}</ref> and the population of the Prefecture of Agadir-Ida Outanane was 487,954 inhabitants.<ref name=\"RGHP\"/>\n\nThree languages are spoken in the city: [[Shilha language|Tashelhit]] (first language of the majority), [[Moroccan Arabic]], and [[French language|French]].\n\nThe city was destroyed by [[1960 Agadir earthquake|an earthquake]] in 1960; it has been completely rebuilt with mandatory seismic standards. It is now the largest [[seaside resort]] in Morocco, where foreign tourists and many residents are attracted by an unusually mild year-round climate. Since 2010 it has been well served by low-cost flights and a motorway from Tangier. The city attracts all walks of life; it has had an annual growth rate of over 6% per year in housing demand while housing production barely exceeds 3.4%.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\nThe mild winter climate (January average midday temperature 20.5&nbsp;\u00b0C/69&nbsp;\u00b0F)<ref name=\"HKO\">[http://www.climate-charts.com/Locations/f/FM60250.php \"Climate (Average Weather) Data\", from NOAA Station Id FM60250, Latitude: 30\u00b0 23'N Longitude: 9\u00b0 34'W Elevation: 23m] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130816233400/http://www.climate-charts.com/Locations/f/FM60250.php |date=2013-08-16 }}.</ref> and good beaches have made it a major \"winter sun\" destination for northern Europeans.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name Agadir is a common Berber noun ''[[Agadir (granary)|agadir]]'' meaning \"wall, enclosure, fortified building, citadel\". This noun is attested in most Berber languages,<ref>See K. Na\u00eft-Zerrad, ''Dictionnaire des racines berb\u00e8res, \u1e0c-G'', Louvain: Peeters, 2002, p. 734.</ref> and may be a loanword from [[Phoenician language|Phoenician-Punic]], a Semitic language spoken in North-Africa until the fifth century CE.<ref>Cf. Hebrew ''g\u0101d\u0113r'' \"wall, place fortified with a wall\" (see S.P. Tregelles, ''Gesenius' Hebrew-Chaldee lexicon'', Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1949, p. 160, which also mentions Classical Arabic ''jad\u012br'' \"a place surrounded by a wall\").</ref>\n\nThere are many more towns in Morocco called Agadir. The city of Agadir's full name in Tashelhit is ''Agadir n Yighir'', literally \"the fortress of the cape\", referring to the nearby promontory named Cape IRhir on maps (a pleonastic name, literally \"Cape Cape\"). Ighir in Berber refers to a mountain or a hill.\n\nA single male inhabitant or native of the town is known in Tashelhit as a ''gg ugadir'' (also a common surname, \"Gougadir\" in French spelling), plural ''ayt ugadir'' \"men of Agadir\" (also collective name, \"men and women of Agadir, people of Agadir\"); a single feminine inhabitant is a ''ult ugadir'' \"woman of Agadir\", plural ''ist ugadir'' \"women of Agadir\". In [[Moroccan Darija|Moroccan Arabic]], an inhabitant is a ''agadiri'', plural ''agadiriyin'', feminine ''agadiriya'', plural ''agadiriyat''.\n\n==History==\nLittle history is recorded on Agadir before the 12th century.\n\nIn the 2nd century AD, the historian [[Polybius]] referred to North Africa on the Atlantic, a place called ''cap Rhysaddir'', that may have been located near Agadir but its location is still under debate.\n\nThe oldest cartographic mention of Agadir is on a map from 1325: at the approximate location of the modern city there was an indication of a place called ''Porto Mesegina'', after the name of a Berber tribe already mentioned in the 12th century, the ''Mesguina'', that is to say the ''Ksima''.\n\nAt the end of the medieval period, Agadir was a town of some notoriety. The name itself, ''Agadir al-harba'', was attested to for the first time in 1510.<ref>A name which seemed to attest to the existence of a Wednesday market \u2013 the ''souk el-arba'' close to a collective granary. ''Chronique de Santa-Cruz du Cap de Gu\u00e9'' {{in lang|fr}} , Paris, 1934</ref>\n\nIn 1505, the [[Portugal|Portuguese]], who were already installed on the Moroccan coast, founded a trading post and a fort at the foot of the hill to the sea, ''Santa Cruz do Cabo de Aguer'' on the site of the now-vanished neighborhood of Founti (named after the Portuguese word ''fonte'' meaning ''fountain'') under a governor.\n\nQuickly, the Portuguese were exposed to the hostility of the tribes of the region. From 1530, they were blockaded in Santa Cruz. Portuguese weakness showed itself on 12 March 1541 when Sherif Sa\u00e2dien [[Mohammed ash-Sheikh]] captured the fortress of Santa Cruz de Aguer. Six hundred Portuguese survivors were taken prisoner, including the governor, Guterre de Monroy, and his daughter, Dona Mecia. The captives were redeemed by the holy men mostly from Portugal. Dona Mecia, whose husband was killed during the battle, became the wife of Sheikh Mohammed ash-Sheikh but died in childbirth in 1544. In the same year, Mohammed ash-Sheikh released the Governor Guterre de Monroy, whom he had befriended.<ref>''Chronique de Santa-Cruz du Cap de Gu\u00e9'', Paris, 1934 (Fr)</ref>\n\nThe Portuguese possessions in Morocco, acquired between 1505 and 1520, were regressing. After the loss of Agadir, the Portuguese were obliged to abandon [[Safi, Morocco|Safi]] and [[Azemmour]]. Morocco was beginning to be less important for Portugal which now turned to India and Brazil. After 1550, the Portuguese no longer held anything in Morocco other than Mazagan  (now [[El Jadida]]), [[Tangier]] and [[Ceuta]].\n\nThe story of the Portuguese presence (from the installation in 1505 until the fall on 12 March 1541) is described in  manuscript (published for the first time, with French translation, by Pierre de Cenival in 1934) entitled \"ESTE HE O ORIGEM E COME\u00c7O E CABO DA VILLA DE SANTA CRUZ DO CABO DE GUE D'AGOA DE NARBA\", written by anonymous who was captured in 12-III-34 and was five years inprisioned in [[Taroudannt]] (cf. \"Santa Cruz do Cabo de Gue d'Agoa de Narba \u2013 Estudo e Cr\u00f3nica\", Joao Marinho e Santos, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Azevedo e Silva e Mohammed Nadir,bilingual edition, Viseu 2007).\n\nIn 1572, the Casbah was built on top of the hill by Moulay [[Abdallah al-Ghalib]], successor to Mohammed ash-Sheikh. It was now called ''Agadir N'Ighir'', literally: ''fortified granary of the hill'' in [[Shilha language|Tachelhit]].<ref>''Ighir'' (pronounced ''irrhir'') that is to say ''shoulder'', then ''height''.</ref>\n\nIn the 17th century, during the reign of the Berber dynasty of [[Tazerwalt]], Agadir was a harbour of some importance, expanding its trade with Europe. There was, however, no real port nor a wharf. Agadir traded mainly in sugar, wax, copper, hides and skins.<ref>Charles-Andr\u00e9 Julien, ''History of North Africa'', Paris, 1994 (Fr)</ref> Europeans brought their manufactured goods, particularly weapons and textiles. Under the reign of Sultan [[Moulay Ismail]] (1645\u20131727) and his successors, the trade with France, until then an active partner regressed to the English and the Dutch.\n\n[[Image:Agadir porte Kasbah 0085.JPG|thumb|<center>The entrance of the Casbah</center>]]\nIn 1731, the town was completely destroyed by an earthquake.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/world/events/1960_02_29.php |title=Historic Earthquakes |publisher=Earthquake.usgs.gov |accessdate=2012-03-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508031843/http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/world/events/1960_02_29.php |archivedate=2012-05-08 }}</ref> The harbour of Agadir was then ordered to be closed when [[Essaouira]] was established farther north.\n\nIn 1746, the Dutch set up a trading post at the foot of the Casbah under the authority of the Sultan, and undoubtedly participated in the restoration of the city. Above the door of the Casbah, the Dutch inscription can still be seen with its transcription in Arabic: \"Vreest God ende eert den Kooning\", which means \"Fear God and honour the King\", and the date 1746.\n\nAfter a long period of prosperity during the reigns of the Saadian and Alawite dynasties, Agadir declined from 1760 because of the pre-eminence given to the competing port of Essaouira by the Alawite Sultan [[Mohammed ben Abdallah]] who wanted to punish the Souss for rebelling against his authority. This decline lasted a century and a half. In 1789, a European traveler gave a brief description of Agadir: \"It is now a ghost town, there are no more than a few houses and these are crumbling into ruins\".\n\nIn 1881, Sultan [[Hassan I of Morocco|Moulay Hassan]] reopened the harbour to trade in order to supply the expeditions he planned in the south. These expeditions, which were to reassert his authority over the Souss tribes and counter the plans of English and Spanish, were held in 1882 and 1886.<ref>{{cite book|author=Maurice Barbier|title=Le conflit du Sahara occidental|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gyx8UA0oRfoC&pg=PA48|year=1982|publisher=Harmattan|language=French|isbn=978-2-85802-197-0|page=48}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Plan d'Agadir en 1885.jpg|thumb|Map of Agadir in 1885 by Jules Erckmann]]\nIn 1884, [[Charles de Foucauld]] described in ''Reconnaissance au Maroc'' (Reconnaissance in Morocco) his rapid passage to Agadir from the east:\n{{quote|I walk along the shore to Agadir Irir. The road passes below the city, half-way between it and Founti: Founti is a miserable hamlet, a few fishermen's huts; Agadir, despite its white enclosure which gives it the air of a city is, I am told, a poor village depopulated and without trade.<ref>Charles de Foucauld, ''Reconnaissance au Maroc,(1883\u20131884)'', \u00e9d. L'Harmattan, coll. \u00ab Les Introuvables \u00bb, Paris, (r\u00e9imp. 2000) {{ISBN|978-2-7384-6645-7}} (in French)</ref>}}\n\nOn the pretext of a call for help from German companies in the valley of the Souss, Germany decided on 1 July 1911, to extend its interests in Morocco and assert a claim on the country. It sent to the Bay of Agadir, (which harbour was, until 1881, closed to foreign trade) the {{SMS|Panther}} which was quickly joined by the cruiser ''Berlin''. Very strong international reaction, particularly from Great Britain, surprised Germany and triggered the [[Agadir Crisis]] between France and Germany. War threatened. After tough negotiations, a Franco-German treaty was finally signed on 4 November 1911, giving a free hand to France, who would be able to establish its [[protectorate]] over Morocco in return for giving up some colonies in Africa. It was only then that the gunboat ''Panther'' and the cruiser ''Berlin'' left the bay of Agadir.\n\nDue to a miscalculation, the German sales representative [[Hermann Wilberg]], who was sent to provide the pretext for the intervention, only arrived at Agadir three days after the ''Panther'' arrived.\n\nIn 1913, the cities (Agadir N'Ighir and Founti) totalled less than a thousand inhabitants. On 15 June 1913 French troops landed in Agadir. In 1916, the first pier was built near Founti \u2013 a simple jetty, later known as the \"Portuguese jetty\", which remained until the end of the 20th century. After 1920, under the French protectorate, a port was built and the city saw its first development with the construction of the old Talborjt district located on the plateau at the foot of the hill. Two years later, beside Talborjt along the faultline of the river Tildi construction of the popular district of Yahchech began.\n\nAround 1930, Agadir was an important stop for the French airmail service [[A\u00e9ropostale (aviation)|A\u00e9ropostale]] and was frequented by [[Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry|Saint-Exup\u00e9ry]] and [[Jean Mermoz|Mermoz]].\n\nIn the years from 1930, a modern central city began to be built according to the plans of the urban planner [[Henri Prost]], director of the Urban Planning Department of the Protectorate, and his deputy [[Albert Laprade]]: a horseshoe layout based on the waterfront<ref>[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k377753/f369.r=tome+39.langEN Scheme of the Future City] in the magazine ''La G\u00e9ographie'' on Gallica</ref> around a large avenue perpendicular to the waterfront \u2013 the Avenue Lyautey, since renamed Avenue du G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Kettani. In the 1950s, urban development continued under the direction of the Director of Urban Planning Morocco, Michel Ecochard.\n\nAfter 1950 and the opening of the new commercial port, the city grew with fishing, canning, agriculture, and mining. It also began to open up to tourism thanks to its climate and beautiful hotels. Several years later from 1950 to 1956 Agadir organised the Grand Prix of Agadir<ref>See \"Grand Prix automobile d'Agadir\" in French wikipedia</ref> and, from 1954 to 1956, the [[Moroccan Grand Prix]].\n\nIn 1959, the port was visited by the yacht of the Greek shipping magnate [[Aristotle Onassis]] and his guest, [[Winston Churchill]].<ref>[http://www.communautejuiveagadir.com/index.php?page=la-visite-de-churchill-a-agadir The visit of Winston Churchill to Agadir] {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Agadir 1960.jpg|thumb|Agadir in 1960, following the earthquake]]\nBy 1960, Agadir numbered over 40,000 residents when at 15 minutes to midnight on 29 February 1960, it was again almost totally destroyed by an [[1960 Agadir earthquake|earthquake]] of magnitude 5.7 on the Richter scale that lasted 15 seconds, burying the city and killing more than a third of the population.<ref name=\"bensimon\">[http://www.nfb.ca/film/once_agadir Documentary film, Jacques Bensimon, Once Agadir, [[National Film Board of Canada]], consulted 1 November 2010]</ref> The death toll was estimated at 15,000.<ref>[http://www.agadir1960.com/ Website dedicated to the Earthquake at Agadir in 1960] {{in lang|fr}}</ref> The earthquake destroyed the ancient [[Kasbah|Casbah]].\n\nOn seeing the destruction in Agadir, King [[Muhammad V]] of Morocco declared: \"If Destiny decided the destruction of Agadir, its rebuilding depends on our Faith and Will.\"\n\n===Agadir after 1960===\nThe current city was rebuilt {{convert|1|mi|disp=flip}} further south, led by the architects [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Zevaco]], Elijah Azagury, Pierre Coldefy, and Claude Verdugo. Agadir became a large city of over half a million by 2004, with a large port with four basins: the commercial port with a draft of 17 metres, triangle fishing, fishing port, and a pleasure boat port with marina. Agadir was the premier sardine port in the world in the 1980s and has a beach stretching over 10&nbsp;km with fine seafront promenades. Its climate has 340 days of sunshine per year which allows for swimming all year round. The winter is warm and in summer, haze is common.\n\nWith Marrakech, Agadir is a very important centre for tourism  to Morocco, and the city is the most important fishing port in the country. Business is also booming with the export of citrus fruit and vegetables produced in the fertile valley of [[Souss]]. With its white buildings, wide flowered boulevards, modern hotels and European style cafes, Agadir is not a typical city of traditional Morocco but is modern, active and dynamic. The bay of Agadir and the nearby Bay of Taghazout are among the most beautiful bays in Africa.\n\n== Economy ==\n[[File:2010-12-14 Morocco Agadir marina.JPG|thumb|Agadir Marina]]\n[[File:Agadir Port p\u00eache 0093.JPG|thumb|left|Agadir fishing port]]\n\nAgadir's economy relies mainly on tourism and fisheries.

Other major avenues are the Avenue President Kennedy and the Avenue February 29. There is also the Mohammed V mosque, the [[Olh\u00e3o Garden|Olh\u00e3o garden]] (Olh\u00e3o is a coastal city in southern Portugal that is twinned with Agadir) and its memorial museum and the garden Ibn Zaydoun. Some good hotels and restaurants have been built on the main arteries.\n\n===Residential districts===\n* '''Swiss Village''': the oldest district of villas bordered by the Avenue of FAR (Royal Armed Forces), Avenue Mokhtar Soussi, Cairo Avenue, and the Avenue of the United Nations.\n* '''Mixed Sector District''': the French and Spanish Consulates are in this district.\n* '''Founty''' or \"Bay of palm trees\": a seaside area with residential villas, large hotels, holiday homes, and the royal palace.\n* '''High Founty''': a new district of buildings and residential villas, located in the new city centre between the new Court of Appeal and the Marjane supermarket.\n* '''Illigh''': to the east in front of the Hassan II hospital, is a residential area of large villas, housing the \"new bourgeoisie\".\n* '''Charaf''': The Hassan II hospital is in this district.\n* '''Les Amicales''': also known as the \"city of government employees\"\n* '''Dakhla''': close to the faculty of Ibnou Zohr, it has a great mix between modern buildings, ordinary villas, and studio apartments. This new town created in 1979 was the last work before his death of the renowned French urbanist, [[G\u00e9rald Hanning]]. \n* '''Hay Mohammadi''': a new urbanization zone in Agadir with a villa zone and a zone for large groups of buildings to frame the extension of the Avenue des FAR in the northwest.\n* '''Adrar City''': a new district next to the Metro hypermarket.\n* '''Other neighborhoods''': Amsernat, Lakhyam, Erac Bouargane, Massira, Alhouda, Tilila, Tassila, Ben Sergao, Riad Assalam, Islane, Ihchach (Yachech) Nahda, Anza,Assaka, Bir Anzarane, Tikouine, Zaitoune and Tadart.\n\n===The Casbah===\n[[File:Agadir Kasbah 1000.JPG|thumb|Hill of the old Casbah]]\n[[File:Agadir Casbah Oufella nuit.JPG|thumb|The Casbah at Night]]\n\nThe ''Casbah'' (''Agadir Oufella'', ''Agadir le haut'', ''Agadir N'Ighir'', or ''Agadir de la colline'') was, along with Founti by the sea, the oldest district of Agadir. An authentic fortress with winding streets and lively, the Casbah was built in 1572 by Moulay [[Abdallah al-Ghalib]]. Above the front door; today, the original inscription in Arabic and in English reads: \"Fear God and honour the King.\"\n\nOf this fortress there remains, after the earthquake of 29 February 1960, a restored long high wall that surrounds land that is not buildable. The view, however, is exceptional over the bay of Agadir and the ports. The old people of Agadir remember the famous \"Moorish caf\u00e9\" of the Casbah and its panoramic view.\n\nThe hill bears the inscription in Arabic: \"God, Country, King\" which, like the walls, is illuminated at night.\n\n===Old Talborjt===\nOverlooking the waterfront and Wadi Tildi, this old district (whose name is sometimes spelled ''Talbordjt'') was once a shopping area and very lively with its large square where there was a weekly market, hotels, schools, mosque<ref>[http://talborjt1930-1960.pagesperso-orange.fr/intro.html Talborjt 1930\u20131960] {{in lang|fr}}</ref> 90% of the buildings in Old Talborjt were destroyed or severely damaged by the earthquake in 1960. Razed to the ground after the earthquake and now overgrown, it is classified as non-buildable area. Its main thoroughfare, the Avenue El Moun stretches over {{convert|2|km|mi}} and serves only for driving schools that teach their students to drive.\n\n===Souk El Had===\nThis is the largest market in the region. It has about 6,000 small shops. It is surrounded by walls and has several entrances. It is organized into different sectors: furniture, crafts, clothing, vegetables, meat, spices etc. It is possible to find all kinds of handicrafts and traditional decorations.\n\nThe walls have been restored and the interior design is being finished.\n\n===La M\u00e9dina===\n[[File:Medina Agadir2.jpg|upright=0.7|thumb|La M\u00e9dina]]\n\n''La M\u00e9dina'' is a handicrafts space created in 1992 by the Italian artist Coco Polizzi, at Ben Sergao, a district close to Agadir {{convert|4.5|km|mi}} from the city centre. Built using techniques of traditional Berber construction, it is a kind of small open-air museum, on five hectares and home to artisan workshops, a museum, individual residences, a small hotel, and an exotic garden.\n\n===Subdivisions===\nThe prefecture is divided administratively into communes.<ref name=\"Pop\">{{cite web |url=http://www.lavieeco.com/documents_officiels/Recensement%20population.pdf |title=Recensement g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la population et de l'habitat de 2004 |publisher=Haut-commissariat au Plan, Lavieeco.com |accessdate=22 April 2012 |language=Fr |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724191316/http://www.lavieeco.com/documents_officiels/Recensement%20population.pdf |archivedate=24 July 2012 }} {{in lang|ar}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

It is located on the shore of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] near the foot of the [[Atlas Mountains]], just north of the point where the [[Sous River|Souss River]] flows into the ocean and {{convert|316|mi|km|order=flip}} south of [[Casablanca]]. Agadir is the capital of the [[Agadir-Ida Ou Tanane Prefecture|Agadir Ida-U-Tanan Prefecture]] and of the [[Souss-Massa]] economic region. The majority of its inhabitants speak [[Shilha language|Amazigh]] language, one of the two official languages of Morocco.\n\n==Introduction==\nAgadir is one of the major urban centres of Morocco. The municipality of Agadir recorded a population of 421,844 in the [[2014 Moroccan census]].<ref name=census2014/> According to the 2004 census, there were 346,106 inhabitants in that year<ref name=\"RGHP\">[http://www.lavieeco.com/documents_officiels/Recensement%20population.pdf General Census of the population and habitat 2004, Commisariat of Planning,  Website: www.lavieeco.com, consulted on 7 February 2012 {{in lang|fr}}]    {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724191316/http://www.lavieeco.com/documents_officiels/Recensement%20population.pdf |date=24 July 2012 }} {{in lang|ar}}</ref> and the population of the Prefecture of Agadir-Ida Outanane was 487,954 inhabitants.<ref name=\"RGHP\"/>\n\nThree languages are spoken in the city: [[Shilha language|Tashelhit]] (first language of the majority), [[Moroccan Arabic]], and [[French language|French]].\n\nThe city was destroyed by [[1960 Agadir earthquake|an earthquake]] in 1960; it has been completely rebuilt with mandatory seismic standards. It is now the largest [[seaside resort]] in Morocco, where foreign tourists and many residents are attracted by an unusually mild year-round climate. Since 2010 it has been well served by low-cost flights and a motorway from Tangier. The city attracts all walks of life; it has had an annual growth rate of over 6% per year in housing demand while housing production barely exceeds 3.4%.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\nThe mild winter climate (January average midday temperature 20.5&nbsp;\u00b0C/69&nbsp;\u00b0F)<ref name=\"HKO\">[http://www.climate-charts.com/Locations/f/FM60250.php \"Climate (Average Weather) Data\", from NOAA Station Id FM60250, Latitude: 30\u00b0 23'N Longitude: 9\u00b0 34'W Elevation: 23m] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130816233400/http://www.climate-charts.com/Locations/f/FM60250.php |date=2013-08-16 }}.</ref> and good beaches have made it a major \"winter sun\" destination for northern Europeans.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name Agadir is a common Berber noun ''[[Agadir (granary)|agadir]]'' meaning \"wall, enclosure, fortified building, citadel\". This noun is attested in most Berber languages,<ref>See K. Na\u00eft-Zerrad, ''Dictionnaire des racines berb\u00e8res, \u1e0c-G'', Louvain: Peeters, 2002, p. 734.</ref> and may be a loanword from [[Phoenician language|Phoenician-Punic]], a Semitic language spoken in North-Africa until the fifth century CE.<ref>Cf. Hebrew ''g\u0101d\u0113r'' \"wall, place fortified with a wall\" (see S.P. Tregelles, ''Gesenius' Hebrew-Chaldee lexicon'', Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1949, p. 160, which also mentions Classical Arabic ''jad\u012br'' \"a place surrounded by a wall\").</ref>\n\nThere are many more towns in Morocco called Agadir. The city of Agadir's full name in Tashelhit is ''Agadir n Yighir'', literally \"the fortress of the cape\", referring to the nearby promontory named Cape IRhir on maps (a pleonastic name, literally \"Cape Cape\"). Ighir in Berber refers to a mountain or a hill.\n\nA single male inhabitant or native of the town is known in Tashelhit as a ''gg ugadir'' (also a common surname, \"Gougadir\" in French spelling), plural ''ayt ugadir'' \"men of Agadir\" (also collective name, \"men and women of Agadir, people of Agadir\"); a single feminine inhabitant is a ''ult ugadir'' \"woman of Agadir\", plural ''ist ugadir'' \"women of Agadir\". In [[Moroccan Darija|Moroccan Arabic]], an inhabitant is a ''agadiri'', plural ''agadiriyin'', feminine ''agadiriya'', plural ''agadiriyat''.\n\n==History==\nLittle history is recorded on Agadir before the 12th century.\n\nIn the 2nd century AD, the historian [[Polybius]] referred to North Africa on the Atlantic, a place called ''cap Rhysaddir'', that may have been located near Agadir but its location is still under debate.\n\nThe oldest cartographic mention of Agadir is on a map from 1325: at the approximate location of the modern city there was an indication of a place called ''Porto Mesegina'', after the name of a Berber tribe already mentioned in the 12th century, the ''Mesguina'', that is to say the ''Ksima''.\n\nAt the end of the medieval period, Agadir was a town of some notoriety. The name itself, ''Agadir al-harba'', was attested to for the first time in 1510.<ref>A name which seemed to attest to the existence of a Wednesday market \u2013 the ''souk el-arba'' close to a collective granary. ''Chronique de Santa-Cruz du Cap de Gu\u00e9'' {{in lang|fr}} , Paris, 1934</ref>\n\nIn 1505, the [[Portugal|Portuguese]], who were already installed on the Moroccan coast, founded a trading post and a fort at the foot of the hill to the sea, ''Santa Cruz do Cabo de Aguer'' on the site of the now-vanished neighborhood of Founti (named after the Portuguese word ''fonte'' meaning ''fountain'') under a governor.\n\nQuickly, the Portuguese were exposed to the hostility of the tribes of the region. From 1530, they were blockaded in Santa Cruz. Portuguese weakness showed itself on 12 March 1541 when Sherif Sa\u00e2dien [[Mohammed ash-Sheikh]] captured the fortress of Santa Cruz de Aguer. Six hundred Portuguese survivors were taken prisoner, including the governor, Guterre de Monroy, and his daughter, Dona Mecia. The captives were redeemed by the holy men mostly from Portugal. Dona Mecia, whose husband was killed during the battle, became the wife of Sheikh Mohammed ash-Sheikh but died in childbirth in 1544. In the same year, Mohammed ash-Sheikh released the Governor Guterre de Monroy, whom he had befriended.<ref>''Chronique de Santa-Cruz du Cap de Gu\u00e9'', Paris, 1934 (Fr)</ref>\n\nThe Portuguese possessions in Morocco, acquired between 1505 and 1520, were regressing. After the loss of Agadir, the Portuguese were obliged to abandon [[Safi, Morocco|Safi]] and [[Azemmour]]. Morocco was beginning to be less important for Portugal which now turned to India and Brazil. After 1550, the Portuguese no longer held anything in Morocco other than Mazagan  (now [[El Jadida]]), [[Tangier]] and [[Ceuta]].\n\nThe story of the Portuguese presence (from the installation in 1505 until the fall on 12 March 1541) is described in  manuscript (published for the first time, with French translation, by Pierre de Cenival in 1934) entitled \"ESTE HE O ORIGEM E COME\u00c7O E CABO DA VILLA DE SANTA CRUZ DO CABO DE GUE D'AGOA DE NARBA\", written by anonymous who was captured in 12-III-34 and was five years inprisioned in [[Taroudannt]] (cf. \"Santa Cruz do Cabo de Gue d'Agoa de Narba \u2013 Estudo e Cr\u00f3nica\", Joao Marinho e Santos, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Azevedo e Silva e Mohammed Nadir,bilingual edition, Viseu 2007).\n\nIn 1572, the Casbah was built on top of the hill by Moulay [[Abdallah al-Ghalib]], successor to Mohammed ash-Sheikh. It was now called ''Agadir N'Ighir'', literally: ''fortified granary of the hill'' in [[Shilha language|Tachelhit]].<ref>''Ighir'' (pronounced ''irrhir'') that is to say ''shoulder'', then ''height''.</ref>\n\nIn the 17th century, during the reign of the Berber dynasty of [[Tazerwalt]], Agadir was a harbour of some importance, expanding its trade with Europe. There was, however, no real port nor a wharf. Agadir traded mainly in sugar, wax, copper, hides and skins.<ref>Charles-Andr\u00e9 Julien, ''History of North Africa'', Paris, 1994 (Fr)</ref> Europeans brought their manufactured goods, particularly weapons and textiles. Under the reign of Sultan [[Moulay Ismail]] (1645\u20131727) and his successors, the trade with France, until then an active partner regressed to the English and the Dutch.\n\n[[Image:Agadir porte Kasbah 0085.JPG|thumb|<center>The entrance of the Casbah</center>]]\nIn 1731, the town was completely destroyed by an earthquake.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/world/events/1960_02_29.php |title=Historic Earthquakes |publisher=Earthquake.usgs.gov |accessdate=2012-03-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508031843/http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/world/events/1960_02_29.php |archivedate=2012-05-08 }}</ref> The harbour of Agadir was then ordered to be closed when [[Essaouira]] was established farther north.\n\nIn 1746, the Dutch set up a trading post at the foot of the Casbah under the authority of the Sultan, and undoubtedly participated in the restoration of the city. Above the door of the Casbah, the Dutch inscription can still be seen with its transcription in Arabic: \"Vreest God ende eert den Kooning\", which means \"Fear God and honour the King\", and the date 1746.\n\nAfter a long period of prosperity during the reigns of the Saadian and Alawite dynasties, Agadir declined from 1760 because of the pre-eminence given to the competing port of Essaouira by the Alawite Sultan [[Mohammed ben Abdallah]] who wanted to punish the Souss for rebelling against his authority. This decline lasted a century and a half. In 1789, a European traveler gave a brief description of Agadir: \"It is now a ghost town, there are no more than a few houses and these are crumbling into ruins\".\n\nIn 1881, Sultan [[Hassan I of Morocco|Moulay Hassan]] reopened the harbour to trade in order to supply the expeditions he planned in the south. These expeditions, which were to reassert his authority over the Souss tribes and counter the plans of English and Spanish, were held in 1882 and 1886.<ref>{{cite book|author=Maurice Barbier|title=Le conflit du Sahara occidental|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gyx8UA0oRfoC&pg=PA48|year=1982|publisher=Harmattan|language=French|isbn=978-2-85802-197-0|page=48}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Plan d'Agadir en 1885.jpg|thumb|Map of Agadir in 1885 by Jules Erckmann]]\nIn 1884, [[Charles de Foucauld]] described in ''Reconnaissance au Maroc'' (Reconnaissance in Morocco) his rapid passage to Agadir from the east:\n{{quote|I walk along the shore to Agadir Irir. The road passes below the city, half-way between it and Founti: Founti is a miserable hamlet, a few fishermen's huts; Agadir, despite its white enclosure which gives it the air of a city is, I am told, a poor village depopulated and without trade.<ref>Charles de Foucauld, ''Reconnaissance au Maroc,(1883\u20131884)'', \u00e9d. L'Harmattan, coll. \u00ab Les Introuvables \u00bb, Paris, (r\u00e9imp. 2000) {{ISBN|978-2-7384-6645-7}} (in French)</ref>}}\n\nOn the pretext of a call for help from German companies in the valley of the Souss, Germany decided on 1 July 1911, to extend its interests in Morocco and assert a claim on the country. It sent to the Bay of Agadir, (which harbour was, until 1881, closed to foreign trade) the {{SMS|Panther}} which was quickly joined by the cruiser ''Berlin''. Very strong international reaction, particularly from Great Britain, surprised Germany and triggered the [[Agadir Crisis]] between France and Germany. War threatened. After tough negotiations, a Franco-German treaty was finally signed on 4 November 1911, giving a free hand to France, who would be able to establish its [[protectorate]] over Morocco in return for giving up some colonies in Africa. It was only then that the gunboat ''Panther'' and the cruiser ''Berlin'' left the bay of Agadir.\n\nDue to a miscalculation, the German sales representative [[Hermann Wilberg]], who was sent to provide the pretext for the intervention, only arrived at Agadir three days after the ''Panther'' arrived.\n\nIn 1913, the cities (Agadir N'Ighir and Founti) totalled less than a thousand inhabitants. On 15 June 1913 French troops landed in Agadir. In 1916, the first pier was built near Founti \u2013 a simple jetty, later known as the \"Portuguese jetty\", which remained until the end of the 20th century. After 1920, under the French protectorate, a port was built and the city saw its first development with the construction of the old Talborjt district located on the plateau at the foot of the hill. Two years later, beside Talborjt along the faultline of the river Tildi construction of the popular district of Yahchech began.\n\nAround 1930, Agadir was an important stop for the French airmail service [[A\u00e9ropostale (aviation)|A\u00e9ropostale]] and was frequented by [[Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry|Saint-Exup\u00e9ry]] and [[Jean Mermoz|Mermoz]].\n\nIn the years from 1930, a modern central city began to be built according to the plans of the urban planner [[Henri Prost]], director of the Urban Planning Department of the Protectorate, and his deputy [[Albert Laprade]]: a horseshoe layout based on the waterfront<ref>[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k377753/f369.r=tome+39.langEN Scheme of the Future City] in the magazine ''La G\u00e9ographie'' on Gallica</ref> around a large avenue perpendicular to the waterfront \u2013 the Avenue Lyautey, since renamed Avenue du G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Kettani. In the 1950s, urban development continued under the direction of the Director of Urban Planning Morocco, Michel Ecochard.\n\nAfter 1950 and the opening of the new commercial port, the city grew with fishing, canning, agriculture, and mining. It also began to open up to tourism thanks to its climate and beautiful hotels. Several years later from 1950 to 1956 Agadir organised the Grand Prix of Agadir<ref>See \"Grand Prix automobile d'Agadir\" in French wikipedia</ref> and, from 1954 to 1956, the [[Moroccan Grand Prix]].\n\nIn 1959, the port was visited by the yacht of the Greek shipping magnate [[Aristotle Onassis]] and his guest, [[Winston Churchill]].<ref>[http://www.communautejuiveagadir.com/index.php?page=la-visite-de-churchill-a-agadir The visit of Winston Churchill to Agadir] {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Agadir 1960.jpg|thumb|Agadir in 1960, following the earthquake]]\nBy 1960, Agadir numbered over 40,000 residents when at 15 minutes to midnight on 29 February 1960, it was again almost totally destroyed by an [[1960 Agadir earthquake|earthquake]] of magnitude 5.7 on the Richter scale that lasted 15 seconds, burying the city and killing more than a third of the population.<ref name=\"bensimon\">[http://www.nfb.ca/film/once_agadir Documentary film, Jacques Bensimon, Once Agadir, [[National Film Board of Canada]], consulted 1 November 2010]</ref> The death toll was estimated at 15,000.<ref>[http://www.agadir1960.com/ Website dedicated to the Earthquake at Agadir in 1960] {{in lang|fr}}</ref> The earthquake destroyed the ancient [[Kasbah|Casbah]].\n\nOn seeing the destruction in Agadir, King [[Muhammad V]] of Morocco declared: \"If Destiny decided the destruction of Agadir, its rebuilding depends on our Faith and Will.\"\n\n===Agadir after 1960===\nThe current city was rebuilt {{convert|1|mi|disp=flip}} further south, led by the architects [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Zevaco]], Elijah Azagury, Pierre Coldefy, and Claude Verdugo. Agadir became a large city of over half a million by 2004, with a large port with four basins: the commercial port with a draft of 17 metres, triangle fishing, fishing port, and a pleasure boat port with marina. Agadir was the premier sardine port in the world in the 1980s and has a beach stretching over 10&nbsp;km with fine seafront promenades. Its climate has 340 days of sunshine per year which allows for swimming all year round. The winter is warm and in summer, haze is common.\n\nWith Marrakech, Agadir is a very important centre for tourism  to Morocco, and the city is the most important fishing port in the country. Business is also booming with the export of citrus fruit and vegetables produced in the fertile valley of [[Souss]]. With its white buildings, wide flowered boulevards, modern hotels and European style cafes, Agadir is not a typical city of traditional Morocco but is modern, active and dynamic. The bay of Agadir and the nearby Bay of Taghazout are among the most beautiful bays in Africa.\n\n== Economy ==\n[[File:2010-12-14 Morocco Agadir marina.JPG|thumb|Agadir Marina]]\n[[File:Agadir Port p\u00eache 0093.JPG|thumb|left|Agadir fishing port]]\n\nAgadir's economy relies mainly on tourism and fisheries.

An authentic fortress with winding streets and lively, the Casbah was built in 1572 by Moulay [[Abdallah al-Ghalib]]. Above the front door; today, the original inscription in Arabic and in English reads: \"Fear God and honour the King.\"\n\nOf this fortress there remains, after the earthquake of 29 February 1960, a restored long high wall that surrounds land that is not buildable. The view, however, is exceptional over the bay of Agadir and the ports. The old people of Agadir remember the famous \"Moorish caf\u00e9\" of the Casbah and its panoramic view.\n\nThe hill bears the inscription in Arabic: \"God, Country, King\" which, like the walls, is illuminated at night.\n\n===Old Talborjt===\nOverlooking the waterfront and Wadi Tildi, this old district (whose name is sometimes spelled ''Talbordjt'') was once a shopping area and very lively with its large square where there was a weekly market, hotels, schools, mosque<ref>[http://talborjt1930-1960.pagesperso-orange.fr/intro.html Talborjt 1930\u20131960] {{in lang|fr}}</ref> 90% of the buildings in Old Talborjt were destroyed or severely damaged by the earthquake in 1960. Razed to the ground after the earthquake and now overgrown, it is classified as non-buildable area. Its main thoroughfare, the Avenue El Moun stretches over {{convert|2|km|mi}} and serves only for driving schools that teach their students to drive.\n\n===Souk El Had===\nThis is the largest market in the region. It has about 6,000 small shops. It is surrounded by walls and has several entrances. It is organized into different sectors: furniture, crafts, clothing, vegetables, meat, spices etc. It is possible to find all kinds of handicrafts and traditional decorations.\n\nThe walls have been restored and the interior design is being finished.\n\n===La M\u00e9dina===\n[[File:Medina Agadir2.jpg|upright=0.7|thumb|La M\u00e9dina]]\n\n''La M\u00e9dina'' is a handicrafts space created in 1992 by the Italian artist Coco Polizzi, at Ben Sergao, a district close to Agadir {{convert|4.5|km|mi}} from the city centre. Built using techniques of traditional Berber construction, it is a kind of small open-air museum, on five hectares and home to artisan workshops, a museum, individual residences, a small hotel, and an exotic garden.\n\n===Subdivisions===\nThe prefecture is divided administratively into communes.<ref name=\"Pop\">{{cite web |url=http://www.lavieeco.com/documents_officiels/Recensement%20population.pdf |title=Recensement g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la population et de l'habitat de 2004 |publisher=Haut-commissariat au Plan, Lavieeco.com |accessdate=22 April 2012 |language=Fr |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724191316/http://www.lavieeco.com/documents_officiels/Recensement%20population.pdf |archivedate=24 July 2012 }} {{in lang|ar}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

At age sixteen, Foreman had a change of heart and convinced his mother to sign him up for the [[Job Corps]] after seeing an ad for the Corps on TV.

He had a total of 13 fights that year, winning all of them (11 by knockout).\n\nIn 1970, Foreman continued his march toward the undisputed heavyweight title, winning all 12 of his bouts (11 by knockout). Among the opponents he defeated were [[Gregorio Peralta]], whom he decisioned at [[Madison Square Garden]] although Peralta showed that Foreman was vulnerable to fast counter punching mixed with an assertive boxing style. Foreman then defeated [[George Chuvalo]] by technical knockout (TKO) in three rounds. After this win, Foreman defeated [[Charlie Polite]] in four rounds and [[Boone Kirkman]] in three. Peralta and Chuvalo were Foreman's first world level wins. Peralta was the #10 ranked heavyweight in the world in Jan. 1970 per ''the Ring'',<Ref>[https://boxrec.com/media/index.php/The_Ring_Magazine%27s_Annual_Ratings:_1969 The Ring Magazine's Annual Ratings: 1969.]</ref> while Chuvalo was #7 in the world per their March 1971 issue.<Ref>[https://boxrec.com/media/index.php/The_Ring_Magazine%27s_Annual_Ratings:_1970 The Ring Magazine's Annual Ratings: 1970.]</ref>\n\nIn 1971, Foreman won seven more fights, winning all of them by knockout, including a rematch with Peralta, whom he defeated by knockout in the tenth and final round in [[Oakland, California]], and a win over Leroy Caldwell, who he knocked out in the second round. After amassing a record of 32\u20130 (29 KO), he was ranked as the number one challenger by the [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] and [[World Boxing Council|WBC]].\n\n===Sunshine Showdown: Foreman vs. Frazier===\n[[File:George Foreman 1973.jpg|thumbnail|Foreman in 1973]]\n{{Main|Joe Frazier vs. George Foreman}}\nIn 1972, still undefeated and with an impressive knockout record, Foreman was set to challenge undefeated and [[Undisputed Champion|Undisputed]] World [[Heavyweight]] Champion [[Joe Frazier]]. Despite boycotting a title elimination caused by the vacancy resulting from the championship being stripped from [[Muhammad Ali]], Frazier had won the title from [[Jimmy Ellis (boxer)|Jimmy Ellis]] and defended his title four times since, including a 15-round unanimous decision over the previously unbeaten Ali in 1971 after Ali had beaten [[Oscar Bonavena]] and [[Jerry Quarry]]. Despite Foreman's superior size and reach, he was not expected to beat Frazier<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eastsideboxing.com/news.php?p=561&more=1 |title=Why I Don't Believe Those Who Say They Picked Foreman Over Frazier |publisher=Eastsideboxing.com |date=1973-01-21 |accessdate=2012-09-29}}</ref> and was a 3:1 underdog going into the fight.\n\nThe Sunshine Showdown took place on January 22, 1973, in [[Kingston, Jamaica]], with Foreman dominating the fight to win the championship by technical knockout. In ABC's re-broadcast, [[Howard Cosell]] made the memorable call, \"Down goes Frazier! Down goes Frazier! Down goes Frazier!\" Before the fight Frazier was 29\u20130 (25 KO) and Foreman was 37\u20130 (34 KO). Frazier was knocked down six times by Foreman within two rounds (the three-knockdown rule was not in effect for this bout). After the second knockdown, Frazier's balance and mobility were impaired to the extent that he was unable to evade Foreman's combinations. Frazier managed to get to his feet for all six knockdowns, but referee [[Arthur Mercante, Sr.|Arthur Mercante]] eventually called an end to the one-sided bout.\n\nForeman was sometimes characterized by the media as an aloof and antisocial champion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yuddy.com/celebrity/george-foreman/bio|title=George Foreman Bio |accessdate=April 5, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305135640/http://www.yuddy.com/celebrity/George-Foreman/bio |archivedate=March 5, 2010 }}</ref> According to them, he always seemed to wear a sneer and was not often available to the press. Foreman later attributed his demeanor during this time as an emulation of [[Sonny Liston]], for whom he had been an occasional sparring partner. Foreman defended his title successfully twice during his initial reign as champion. His first defense, in Tokyo, pitted him against [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] Heavyweight Champion [[Jose King Roman|Jos\u00e9 Roman]]. Roman was not regarded as a top contender, but had managed to beat a few decent fighters such as EBU champion Spain Jose Manuel Urtain, and was ranked #7 heavyweight in the March 1973 issue of ''the Ring''.<REf>[https://boxrec.com/media/index.php/The_Ring_Magazine%27s_Annual_Ratings:_1972 The Ring Magazine's Annual Ratings: 1972]</ref> It took Foreman only 2 minutes to end the fight, one of the fastest knockouts in a Heavyweight Championship bout.\n\n===Foreman vs. Norton===\n{{Main|George Foreman vs. Ken Norton}}\nForeman's next defense was against a much tougher opponent. In 1974, in [[Caracas]], [[Venezuela]], he faced the highly regarded future hall-of-famer [[Ken Norton]] (who was 30\u20132), a boxer noted for his awkward crossed-arm boxing style, crab-like defense, and heavy punch (a style Foreman emulated in his comeback), who had broken the jaw of [[Muhammad Ali]] in a points victory a year earlier. Norton had a good chin and had performed well against Ali in their two matches, winning the first on points and nearly winning the second. (Norton developed a reputation for showing nerves against heavy hitters, largely beginning with this fight.)  After an even first round, Foreman staggered Norton with an uppercut a minute into round two, buckling him into the ropes.  Norton did not hit the canvas but continued on wobbly legs, clearly not having recovered, and shortly he went down a further two times in quick succession, with the referee intervening and stopping the fight. \"Ken was awesome when he got going. I didn't want him to get into the fight\", Foreman said when interviewed years later.{{Cite quote| date=June 2016}} This fight became known as the \"Caracas Caper\".\n\nForeman had cruised past two of the top names in the rankings. The win gave him a 40\u20130 record with 37 knockouts.\n\n===The Rumble in the Jungle: Foreman vs. Ali===\n{{Main|The Rumble in the Jungle}}\n[[File:Foreman tira golpe a clay.jpg|thumb|250px|Foreman (left) v Ali in Kinshasa]]\nForeman's next title defence, against [[Muhammad Ali]], was historic. During the summer of 1974, he traveled to [[Zaire]] (now the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]) to defend his title against Ali. The bout was promoted as \"The Rumble in the Jungle\".\n\nDuring training in Zaire, Foreman suffered a cut above his eye, forcing postponement of the match for a month. The injury affected his training regimen, as it meant he could not spar in the build-up to the fight and risk the cut being re-opened. He later commented: \"That was the best thing that happened to Ali when we were in Africa\u2014the fact that I had to get ready for the fight without being able to box.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1090594/4/index.htm |work=CNN |title=Video |date=December 15, 1975 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115202805/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1090594/4/index.htm |archivedate=January 15, 2010 }}</ref> Foreman later also claimed he was drugged by his trainer prior to the bout.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=2878507 |title=Foreman claims he was drugged before loss to Ali \u2013 boxing \u2013 ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2007-05-22 |accessdate=2012-09-29}}</ref> Ali used this time to tour Zaire, endearing himself to the public while taunting Foreman at every opportunity. Foreman was favored, having knocked out both Joe Frazier and Ken Norton within two rounds.\n\nWhen Foreman and Ali finally met in the ring, Ali began more aggressively than expected, outscoring Foreman with superior punching speed. In the second round, Ali retreated to the ropes, shielding his head and hitting Foreman in the face at every opportunity. Foreman dug vicious body punches into Ali's sides; however, Foreman was unable to land many big punches to Ali's head. The ring ropes, being much looser than usual{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} (Foreman later charged that [[Angelo Dundee]] had loosened them, and this story is supported by Norman Mailer in the book ''[[The Fight (book)|The Fight]]''), allowed Ali to lean back and away from Foreman's wild swings and then to [[clinch fighting|clinch]] Foreman behind the head, forcing Foreman to expend much extra energy untangling himself. Ali also constantly pushed down on Foreman's neck{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} but was never warned about doing so. To this day, it is unclear whether Ali's pre-fight talk of using speed and movement against Foreman had been just a diversionary tactic or whether his use of what became known as the \"[[rope-a-dope]]\" tactic was an improvisation necessitated by Foreman's constant pressure.\n\nIn either case, Ali was able to occasionally counter off the ropes with blows to the face and penetrated Foreman's defense. Ali continued to take heavy punishment to the body and occasionally a hard jolt to the head. Ali later said he was \"out on his feet\" twice during the bout. As Foreman began to tire, his punches began to lose power and became increasingly wild. An increasingly confident Ali taunted Foreman throughout the bout. Late in the eighth round, Foreman was left off balance by a haymaker, and Ali sprang off the ropes with a flurry to Foreman's head, punctuated by a hard right cross that landed flush on the jaw, knocking Foreman down. [[Muhammad Ali]] was the first boxer to score a knockdown of Foreman.\n\nForeman later reflected that \"it just wasn't my night\". Though he sought one, he was unable to secure a rematch with Ali. It has been suggested in some quarters that Ali was ducking Foreman,{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} although he did give a rematch to [[Joe Frazier]] and to [[Ken Norton]]. Ali fought \"minimal risk\" opponents, such as [[Chuck Wepner]], [[Richard Dunn (boxer)|Richard Dunn]], [[Jean Pierre Coopman]], and [[Alfredo Evangelista]],<ref>{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060722004933/http://www.eastsideboxing.com/news.php?p=7566&more=1 |date=July 22, 2006 }} [http://www.eastsideboxing.com/news.php?p=7566&more=1 Archived from the original.]</ref> as well as formidable opponents, such as Ron Lyle and Joe Frazier.\n\n===First comeback===\n{{Main|George Foreman vs. Joe Frazier II}}\nForeman remained inactive during 1975. In 1976, he announced a comeback and stated his intention of securing a rematch with Ali. His first opponent was to be [[Ron Lyle]], who had been defeated by [[Muhammad Ali]] in 1975, via 11th-round TKO. Lyle was the #5 rated heavyweight in the world at the time per the March 1976 issue of ''the Ring''.<Ref>[https://boxrec.com/media/index.php/The_Ring_Magazine%27s_Annual_Ratings:_1975 The Ring Magazine's Annual Ratings: 1975]</ref> At the end of the first round, Lyle landed a hard right that sent Foreman staggering across the ring. In the second round, Foreman pounded Lyle against the ropes and might have scored a KO, but due to a timekeeping error the bell rang with a minute still remaining in the round and Lyle survived. In the third, Foreman pressed forward, with Lyle waiting to counter off the ropes. In the fourth, a brutal slugfest erupted. A cluster of power punches from Lyle sent Foreman to the canvas. When Foreman got up, Lyle staggered him again, but just as Foreman seemed finished, he retaliated with a hard right to the side of the head, knocking down Lyle. Lyle beat the count, then landed another brutal combination, knocking Foreman down for the second time. Again, Foreman beat the count. Foreman said later that he had never been hit so hard in a fight and remembered looking down at the canvas and seeing blood. In the fifth round, both fighters continued to ignore defense and traded their hardest punches, looking crude. Each man staggered the other, and each seemed almost out on his feet. Then, as if finally tired, Lyle stopped punching, and Foreman delivered a dozen unanswered blows until Lyle collapsed. Lyle remained on the canvas and was counted out, giving Foreman the KO victory. The fight was named by ''[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]'' as \"The Fight of the Year.\"\n\nFor his next bout, Foreman chose to face [[Joe Frazier]] in a rematch. Frazier was then the world's #3 heavyweight per ''the Ring''.<Ref>[https://boxrec.com/media/index.php/The_Ring_Magazine%27s_Annual_Ratings:_1975 The Ring Magazine's Annual Ratings: 1975]</ref> Because of the one-sided Foreman victory in their first fight, and the fact that Frazier had taken a tremendous amount of punishment from Ali in Manila a year earlier, few expected him to win. Frazier at this point was 32\u20133, and Foreman was 41\u20131. However, the 2nd Foreman-Frazier fight was fairly competitive for its duration, as Frazier used quick head movements to make Foreman miss with his hardest punches.   Frazier was wearing a contact lens for his vision which was knocked loose during the bout. After being unable to mount a significant offense, Frazier was eventually floored twice by Foreman in the fifth round and the fight was stopped. Next, Foreman knocked out [[Scott LeDoux]] in three rounds and prospect John Dino Denis in four to finish the year.\n\n===Retirement and spiritual rebirth===\n[[File:Foreman as reverend.jpg|thumb|180px|Foreman as reverend at the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ, 1994]]\n1977 proved to be a life changing year for Foreman. After knocking out Pedro Agosto in four rounds at [[Pensacola, Florida]], Foreman flew to [[Puerto Rico]] a day before the fight without giving himself time to acclimatize. His opponent was the skilled boxer [[Jimmy Young (boxer)|Jimmy Young]], who had beaten [[Ron Lyle]] and lost a very controversial decision to Muhammad Ali the previous year. Foreman fought cautiously early on, allowing Young to settle into the fight. Young constantly complained about Foreman pushing him, for which Foreman eventually had a point deducted by the referee, although Young was never warned for his persistent holding. Foreman badly hurt Young in round 7 but was unable to land a finishing blow. Foreman, tired during the second half of the fight and suffered a knockdown in round 12 en route to losing a decision.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nForeman became ill in his dressing room after the fight. He was suffering from exhaustion and [[heatstroke]] and stated he had a [[near-death experience]]. He spoke of being in a hellish, frightening place of nothingness and despair, and realized that he was in the midst of death. Though not yet religious, he began to plead with God to help him. He explained that he sensed God asking him to change his life and ways. When he said, \"I don't care if this is death \u2013 I still believe there is a God\", he felt a hand pull him out and sensed that he was also suffering [[stigmata]].{{citation needed|reason=sourced only to own website|date=April 2017}} After this experience, Foreman became a [[Born again Christianity|born-again Christian]], dedicating his life for the next decade to God. Although he did not formally retire from boxing, Foreman stopped fighting and became an ordained minister, initially preaching on street corners before becoming the reverend at the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://texasarchive.org/2017_00606|title=George Foreman and the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ (1980)|last=|first=|date=|website=Texas Archive of the Moving Image|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 12, 2019}}</ref> in Houston<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.georgeforeman.com/church |title=The Official Site of George Foreman |website=Georgeforeman.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-25}}</ref> and devoting himself to his family and his congregation. He also opened a youth center<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.georgeforeman.com/youthcenter.html |title=George Foreman Youth Center, Houston |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609073250/http://www.georgeforeman.com/youthcenter.html |archivedate=June 9, 2007 }}</ref> that bears his name. Foreman continues to speak about his experience on Christian television broadcasts such as ''[[The 700 Club]]'' and the [[Trinity Broadcasting Network]] and later joked that Young had knocked the devil out of him.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n===Second comeback===\nIn 1987, after 10 years away from the ring, Foreman surprised the boxing world by announcing a comeback at the age of 38. In his autobiography, he wrote that his primary motive was to raise money to fund the youth center he had created, which had required much of the money he had earned in the initial phase of his career. Another stated ambition was to fight [[Mike Tyson]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://coxscorner.tripod.com/foreman_tyson_fl.html |title=Why We Never Saw Foreman-Tyson |website=Coxscorner.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-25}}</ref> For his first fight, he went to [[Sacramento, California]], where he beat [[Journeyman (boxing)|journeyman]] Steve Zouski by a knockout in four rounds. Foreman weighed {{convert|267|lb|abbr=on}} for the fight and looked badly out of shape. Although many thought his decision to return to the ring was a mistake, Foreman countered that he had returned to prove that age was not a barrier to people achieving their goals (as he said later, he wanted to show that age 40 is not a \"death sentence\"). He won four more bouts that year, gradually slimming down and improving his fitness. In 1988, he won nine times. Perhaps his most notable win during this period was a seventh-round knockout of former Light Heavyweight and [[Cruiserweight (boxing)|Cruiserweight]] Champion [[Dwight Muhammad Qawi]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nHaving always been a deliberate fighter, Foreman had not lost much mobility in the ring since his first \"retirement\", although he found it harder to keep his balance after throwing big punches and could no longer throw rapid combinations. He was still capable of landing heavy single blows, however. The late-round fatigue that had plagued him in the ring as a young man now seemed to be unexpectedly gone, and he could comfortably compete for 12 rounds. Foreman attributed this to his new, relaxed fighting style (he has spoken of how, earlier in his career, his lack of stamina came from an enormous amount of nervous tension).{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nBy 1989, while continuing his comeback, Foreman had sold his name and face for the advertising of various products, selling everything from [[George Foreman Grill|grills]] to [[muffler]]s on TV. For this purpose{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} his public persona was reinvented, and the formerly aloof, ominous Foreman had been replaced by a smiling, friendly George. He and Ali had become friends, and he followed in Ali's footsteps by making himself a celebrity outside the boundaries of boxing.\n\nForeman continued his string of victories, winning five more fights, the most impressive being a three-round win over [[Bert Cooper]], who went on to contest the Undisputed Heavyweight title against [[Evander Holyfield]].\n\n===Foreman vs. Cooney===\n{{Main|George Foreman vs. Gerry Cooney}}\nIn 1990, Foreman met former title challenger [[Gerry Cooney]] in Atlantic City. Cooney was coming off a long period of inactivity, but was well regarded for his punching power. Cooney wobbled Foreman in the first round, but Foreman landed several powerful punches in the second round. Cooney was knocked down twice and Foreman scored a devastating KO. Foreman went on to win four more fights that year.\n\n===Foreman vs. Holyfield===\n{{Main|Evander Holyfield vs. George Foreman}}\nThe following year, Foreman was given the opportunity to challenge undisputed heavyweight champion [[Evander Holyfield]], who was in tremendous shape at 208 pounds, for the world title in a [[pay-per-view]] boxing event. Very few boxing experts gave the 42-year-old Foreman a chance of winning. Foreman, who weighed in at 257 pounds, began the contest by marching forward, absorbing several of Holyfield's best combinations and occasionally landing a powerful swing of his own. Holyfield proved too tough and agile to knock down and was well ahead on points throughout the fight, but Foreman surprised many by lasting the full 12 rounds, losing his challenge on points. Round 7, in which Foreman knocked Holyfield off balance before being staggered by a powerful combination, was expected to be [[Ring Magazine round of the year|''Ring Magazine'''s \"Round of the Year\"]],{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} though no award was given in 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ringtv.craveonline.com/news/171651-past-winners-of-the-rings-year-end-awards|title=PAST WINNERS OF THE RING'S YEAR-END AWARDS \u2013 Ring TV|author=THE RING|date=24 February 2012|work=Ring TV|accessdate=12 September 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160320110422/http://ringtv.craveonline.com/news/171651-past-winners-of-the-rings-year-end-awards|archivedate=20 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nA year later, Foreman fought journeyman [[Alex Stewart (boxer)|Alex Stewart]], who had previously been stopped in the first round by [[Mike Tyson]]. Foreman knocked down Stewart twice in the second round but expended a lot of energy in doing so. He was subsequently tired, and Stewart rebounded. By the end of the 10th and final round, Foreman's face was bloodied and swollen, but the judges awarded him a  majority decision win.\n\n===Foreman vs. Morrison===\n{{Main|George Foreman vs. Tommy Morrison}}\nIn 1993, Foreman received another title shot, although this was for the vacant [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] title. Foreman's opponent was [[Tommy Morrison]], a young prospect known for his punching power. Morrison retreated throughout the fight, refusing to trade toe-to-toe, and sometimes he turned his back on Foreman. The strategy paid off and he outboxed Foreman from long range. After 12 rounds, Morrison won a unanimous decision.\n\nIn this period, Foreman also starred briefly in the [[sitcom|situation comedy]] ''[[George (1993 TV series)|George]]'' on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].  The show, which featured Foreman as a retired boxer, premiered in November, 1993, and ran for ten episodes where nine aired.  The show was co-produced by actor and former boxer [[Tony Danza]].<ref>{{cite magazine|author=TV Guide |url= http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/george/cast/201620|title=George Cast and Details |magazine=TV Guide |accessdate=2012-09-07}}</ref>\n\n===Regaining the title: Foreman vs. Moorer===\n{{Main|Michael Moorer vs. George Foreman}}\n[[File:Elgrafico 3918 foreman.jpg|thumb|170px|Foreman celebrating his new world championship at 45 years old, after beating Michael Moorer]]\nIn 1994, Foreman again sought to challenge for the world championship after [[Michael Moorer]] had beaten Holyfield for the [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] and [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] titles.\n\nHaving lost his last fight against Morrison, Foreman was unranked and in no position to demand another title shot. His relatively high profile, however, made a title shot against Moorer, 19 years his junior, a lucrative prospect at seemingly little risk for the champion.\n\nForeman's title challenge against Moorer took place on November 5 in [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], with Foreman wearing the same red trunks he had worn in his title loss to Ali 20 years earlier. This time, however, Foreman was a substantial underdog. For nine rounds, Moorer easily outboxed him, hitting and moving away, while Foreman chugged forward, seemingly unable to \"pull the trigger\" on his punches. Entering the tenth round, Foreman was trailing on all scorecards. However, Foreman launched a comeback in the tenth round and hit Moorer with a number of punches. Then a short right hand caught Moorer on the tip of his chin, gashing open his bottom lip and he collapsed to the canvas. He lay flat on the canvas as the referee counted him out.\n\nIn an instant, Foreman had regained the title he had lost to Muhammad Ali two decades before. He went back to his corner and knelt in prayer as the arena erupted in cheers. With this historic victory, Foreman broke three records: he became, at age 45, the oldest fighter ever to win a World Championship; 20 years after losing his title for the first time, he broke the record for the fighter with the longest interval between his first and second world championships; and the age spread of 19 years between the champion and challenger was the largest of any heavyweight boxing championship fight.\n\n===Foreman vs. Schulz===\n\n====Prelude====\nShortly after the 1994 Moorer fight, Foreman began talking about a potential superfight with [[Mike Tyson]], then the youngest heavyweight champion on record. In 1995, ''The New York Times'' quoted Foreman as stating, \"If he doesn't sign with [[Don King (boxing promoter)#Mike Tyson|Don King]], we'll fight before the end of the year... I can't be bothered having trouble with Don King. Every contract has some complication.\"<ref>{{cite news |last= Eskenazi|first= Gerald|date= February 15, 1995|title= The Jewel in Foreman's Crown?

For reasons not clearly known, Foreman refused to fight Tucker and allowed the WBA to strip him of that belt.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n====Schulz match====\n{{Main|George Foreman vs. Axel Schulz}}\nOn April 22, 1995, Foreman fought mid-level underdog prospect [[Axel Schulz]], of Germany, in defense of his remaining IBF title. Schulz jabbed strongly from long range, and exhibited increasing confidence as the fight progressed. Foreman finished the fight with a swelling over one eye, but was awarded a controversial majority decision. The IBF ordered an immediate rematch to be held in Germany; Foreman refused the terms and was stripped of his remaining title, yet continued to be recognized as the [[Lineal championship|Lineal Heavyweight Champion]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n===Losing the title: Foreman vs. Briggs===\n{{Main|George Foreman vs. Shannon Briggs}}\nIn 1996, Foreman returned to Tokyo, scoring an easy win over the unrated [[Crawford Grimsley]] by a 12-round decision. In 1997, he faced contender [[Lou Savarese]], winning a close decision in a grueling, competitive encounter. Then, yet another opportunity came Foreman's way as the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] decided to match him against [[Shannon Briggs]] in a 1997 \"eliminator bout\" for the right to face WBC champion [[Lennox Lewis]]. After 12 rounds, in which Foreman consistently rocked Briggs with power punches, almost everyone at ringside saw Foreman as the clear winner.<ref>{{cite news |first=Timothy W. |last=Smith |title=BOXING; Briggs Wins, Crowd Boos and Foreman Says He Likely Won't Fight Again |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/23/sports/boxing-briggs-wins-crowd-boos-and-foreman-says-he-likely-won-t-fight-again.html |work=New York Times |date=November 23, 1997 |access-date=January 26, 2017}}</ref> Once again there was a controversial decision\u2014but this time it went in favor of Foreman's opponent, with Briggs awarded a points win.

However, he did plan a return bout against [[Larry Holmes]] in 1999, scheduled to take place at the Houston [[Astrodome]] on pay per view. The fight was to be billed as \"The Birthday Bash\" due to both fighters' upcoming birthdays. Foreman was set to make $10 million and Holmes was to make $4 million, but negotiations fell through and the fight was cancelled. With a continuing affinity for the sport, Foreman became a respected boxing analyst for HBO.\n\nForeman said he had no plans to resume his career as a boxer, but then announced in February 2004 that he was training for one more comeback fight to demonstrate that the age of 55, like 40, is not a \"death sentence.\" The bout, against an unspecified opponent (rumored to be [[Trevor Berbick]]), never materialized (it was widely thought that Foreman's wife had been a major factor in the change of plans). George Foreman left the sport of boxing after leaving HBO to pursue other opportunities.\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:GeorgeForemanSept09.jpg|thumb|right|Foreman speaking in Houston, Texas, in September 2009]]\nForeman has been married to Mary Joan Martelly since 1985.

He dropped out of school at the age of fifteen and spent time as a mugger. At age sixteen, Foreman had a change of heart and convinced his mother to sign him up for the [[Job Corps]] after seeing an ad for the Corps on TV. As part of the Job Corps, Foreman earned his [[General Educational Development|GED]] and trained to become a [[carpenter]] and [[bricklayer]].<ref>Hauser, Melanie.

He had a total of 13 fights that year, winning all of them (11 by knockout).\n\nIn 1970, Foreman continued his march toward the undisputed heavyweight title, winning all 12 of his bouts (11 by knockout). Among the opponents he defeated were [[Gregorio Peralta]], whom he decisioned at [[Madison Square Garden]] although Peralta showed that Foreman was vulnerable to fast counter punching mixed with an assertive boxing style. Foreman then defeated [[George Chuvalo]] by technical knockout (TKO) in three rounds. After this win, Foreman defeated [[Charlie Polite]] in four rounds and [[Boone Kirkman]] in three. Peralta and Chuvalo were Foreman's first world level wins. Peralta was the #10 ranked heavyweight in the world in Jan. 1970 per ''the Ring'',<Ref>[https://boxrec.com/media/index.php/The_Ring_Magazine%27s_Annual_Ratings:_1969 The Ring Magazine's Annual Ratings: 1969.]</ref> while Chuvalo was #7 in the world per their March 1971 issue.<Ref>[https://boxrec.com/media/index.php/The_Ring_Magazine%27s_Annual_Ratings:_1970 The Ring Magazine's Annual Ratings: 1970.]</ref>\n\nIn 1971, Foreman won seven more fights, winning all of them by knockout, including a rematch with Peralta, whom he defeated by knockout in the tenth and final round in [[Oakland, California]], and a win over Leroy Caldwell, who he knocked out in the second round. After amassing a record of 32\u20130 (29 KO), he was ranked as the number one challenger by the [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] and [[World Boxing Council|WBC]].\n\n===Sunshine Showdown: Foreman vs. Frazier===\n[[File:George Foreman 1973.jpg|thumbnail|Foreman in 1973]]\n{{Main|Joe Frazier vs. George Foreman}}\nIn 1972, still undefeated and with an impressive knockout record, Foreman was set to challenge undefeated and [[Undisputed Champion|Undisputed]] World [[Heavyweight]] Champion [[Joe Frazier]]. Despite boycotting a title elimination caused by the vacancy resulting from the championship being stripped from [[Muhammad Ali]], Frazier had won the title from [[Jimmy Ellis (boxer)|Jimmy Ellis]] and defended his title four times since, including a 15-round unanimous decision over the previously unbeaten Ali in 1971 after Ali had beaten [[Oscar Bonavena]] and [[Jerry Quarry]]. Despite Foreman's superior size and reach, he was not expected to beat Frazier<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eastsideboxing.com/news.php?p=561&more=1 |title=Why I Don't Believe Those Who Say They Picked Foreman Over Frazier |publisher=Eastsideboxing.com |date=1973-01-21 |accessdate=2012-09-29}}</ref> and was a 3:1 underdog going into the fight.\n\nThe Sunshine Showdown took place on January 22, 1973, in [[Kingston, Jamaica]], with Foreman dominating the fight to win the championship by technical knockout. In ABC's re-broadcast, [[Howard Cosell]] made the memorable call, \"Down goes Frazier! Down goes Frazier! Down goes Frazier!\" Before the fight Frazier was 29\u20130 (25 KO) and Foreman was 37\u20130 (34 KO). Frazier was knocked down six times by Foreman within two rounds (the three-knockdown rule was not in effect for this bout). After the second knockdown, Frazier's balance and mobility were impaired to the extent that he was unable to evade Foreman's combinations. Frazier managed to get to his feet for all six knockdowns, but referee [[Arthur Mercante, Sr.|Arthur Mercante]] eventually called an end to the one-sided bout.\n\nForeman was sometimes characterized by the media as an aloof and antisocial champion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yuddy.com/celebrity/george-foreman/bio|title=George Foreman Bio |accessdate=April 5, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305135640/http://www.yuddy.com/celebrity/George-Foreman/bio |archivedate=March 5, 2010 }}</ref> According to them, he always seemed to wear a sneer and was not often available to the press. Foreman later attributed his demeanor during this time as an emulation of [[Sonny Liston]], for whom he had been an occasional sparring partner. Foreman defended his title successfully twice during his initial reign as champion. His first defense, in Tokyo, pitted him against [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] Heavyweight Champion [[Jose King Roman|Jos\u00e9 Roman]]. Roman was not regarded as a top contender, but had managed to beat a few decent fighters such as EBU champion Spain Jose Manuel Urtain, and was ranked #7 heavyweight in the March 1973 issue of ''the Ring''.<REf>[https://boxrec.com/media/index.php/The_Ring_Magazine%27s_Annual_Ratings:_1972 The Ring Magazine's Annual Ratings: 1972]</ref> It took Foreman only 2 minutes to end the fight, one of the fastest knockouts in a Heavyweight Championship bout.\n\n===Foreman vs. Norton===\n{{Main|George Foreman vs. Ken Norton}}\nForeman's next defense was against a much tougher opponent. In 1974, in [[Caracas]], [[Venezuela]], he faced the highly regarded future hall-of-famer [[Ken Norton]] (who was 30\u20132), a boxer noted for his awkward crossed-arm boxing style, crab-like defense, and heavy punch (a style Foreman emulated in his comeback), who had broken the jaw of [[Muhammad Ali]] in a points victory a year earlier. Norton had a good chin and had performed well against Ali in their two matches, winning the first on points and nearly winning the second. (Norton developed a reputation for showing nerves against heavy hitters, largely beginning with this fight.)  After an even first round, Foreman staggered Norton with an uppercut a minute into round two, buckling him into the ropes.  Norton did not hit the canvas but continued on wobbly legs, clearly not having recovered, and shortly he went down a further two times in quick succession, with the referee intervening and stopping the fight. \"Ken was awesome when he got going. I didn't want him to get into the fight\", Foreman said when interviewed years later.{{Cite quote| date=June 2016}} This fight became known as the \"Caracas Caper\".\n\nForeman had cruised past two of the top names in the rankings. The win gave him a 40\u20130 record with 37 knockouts.\n\n===The Rumble in the Jungle: Foreman vs. Ali===\n{{Main|The Rumble in the Jungle}}\n[[File:Foreman tira golpe a clay.jpg|thumb|250px|Foreman (left) v Ali in Kinshasa]]\nForeman's next title defence, against [[Muhammad Ali]], was historic. During the summer of 1974, he traveled to [[Zaire]] (now the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]) to defend his title against Ali. The bout was promoted as \"The Rumble in the Jungle\".\n\nDuring training in Zaire, Foreman suffered a cut above his eye, forcing postponement of the match for a month. The injury affected his training regimen, as it meant he could not spar in the build-up to the fight and risk the cut being re-opened. He later commented: \"That was the best thing that happened to Ali when we were in Africa\u2014the fact that I had to get ready for the fight without being able to box.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1090594/4/index.htm |work=CNN |title=Video |date=December 15, 1975 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115202805/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1090594/4/index.htm |archivedate=January 15, 2010 }}</ref> Foreman later also claimed he was drugged by his trainer prior to the bout.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=2878507 |title=Foreman claims he was drugged before loss to Ali \u2013 boxing \u2013 ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2007-05-22 |accessdate=2012-09-29}}</ref> Ali used this time to tour Zaire, endearing himself to the public while taunting Foreman at every opportunity. Foreman was favored, having knocked out both Joe Frazier and Ken Norton within two rounds.\n\nWhen Foreman and Ali finally met in the ring, Ali began more aggressively than expected, outscoring Foreman with superior punching speed. In the second round, Ali retreated to the ropes, shielding his head and hitting Foreman in the face at every opportunity. Foreman dug vicious body punches into Ali's sides; however, Foreman was unable to land many big punches to Ali's head. The ring ropes, being much looser than usual{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} (Foreman later charged that [[Angelo Dundee]] had loosened them, and this story is supported by Norman Mailer in the book ''[[The Fight (book)|The Fight]]''), allowed Ali to lean back and away from Foreman's wild swings and then to [[clinch fighting|clinch]] Foreman behind the head, forcing Foreman to expend much extra energy untangling himself. Ali also constantly pushed down on Foreman's neck{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} but was never warned about doing so. To this day, it is unclear whether Ali's pre-fight talk of using speed and movement against Foreman had been just a diversionary tactic or whether his use of what became known as the \"[[rope-a-dope]]\" tactic was an improvisation necessitated by Foreman's constant pressure.\n\nIn either case, Ali was able to occasionally counter off the ropes with blows to the face and penetrated Foreman's defense. Ali continued to take heavy punishment to the body and occasionally a hard jolt to the head. Ali later said he was \"out on his feet\" twice during the bout. As Foreman began to tire, his punches began to lose power and became increasingly wild. An increasingly confident Ali taunted Foreman throughout the bout. Late in the eighth round, Foreman was left off balance by a haymaker, and Ali sprang off the ropes with a flurry to Foreman's head, punctuated by a hard right cross that landed flush on the jaw, knocking Foreman down. [[Muhammad Ali]] was the first boxer to score a knockdown of Foreman.\n\nForeman later reflected that \"it just wasn't my night\". Though he sought one, he was unable to secure a rematch with Ali. It has been suggested in some quarters that Ali was ducking Foreman,{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} although he did give a rematch to [[Joe Frazier]] and to [[Ken Norton]]. Ali fought \"minimal risk\" opponents, such as [[Chuck Wepner]], [[Richard Dunn (boxer)|Richard Dunn]], [[Jean Pierre Coopman]], and [[Alfredo Evangelista]],<ref>{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060722004933/http://www.eastsideboxing.com/news.php?p=7566&more=1 |date=July 22, 2006 }} [http://www.eastsideboxing.com/news.php?p=7566&more=1 Archived from the original.]</ref> as well as formidable opponents, such as Ron Lyle and Joe Frazier.\n\n===First comeback===\n{{Main|George Foreman vs. Joe Frazier II}}\nForeman remained inactive during 1975. In 1976, he announced a comeback and stated his intention of securing a rematch with Ali. His first opponent was to be [[Ron Lyle]], who had been defeated by [[Muhammad Ali]] in 1975, via 11th-round TKO. Lyle was the #5 rated heavyweight in the world at the time per the March 1976 issue of ''the Ring''.<Ref>[https://boxrec.com/media/index.php/The_Ring_Magazine%27s_Annual_Ratings:_1975 The Ring Magazine's Annual Ratings: 1975]</ref> At the end of the first round, Lyle landed a hard right that sent Foreman staggering across the ring. In the second round, Foreman pounded Lyle against the ropes and might have scored a KO, but due to a timekeeping error the bell rang with a minute still remaining in the round and Lyle survived. In the third, Foreman pressed forward, with Lyle waiting to counter off the ropes. In the fourth, a brutal slugfest erupted. A cluster of power punches from Lyle sent Foreman to the canvas. When Foreman got up, Lyle staggered him again, but just as Foreman seemed finished, he retaliated with a hard right to the side of the head, knocking down Lyle. Lyle beat the count, then landed another brutal combination, knocking Foreman down for the second time. Again, Foreman beat the count. Foreman said later that he had never been hit so hard in a fight and remembered looking down at the canvas and seeing blood. In the fifth round, both fighters continued to ignore defense and traded their hardest punches, looking crude. Each man staggered the other, and each seemed almost out on his feet. Then, as if finally tired, Lyle stopped punching, and Foreman delivered a dozen unanswered blows until Lyle collapsed. Lyle remained on the canvas and was counted out, giving Foreman the KO victory. The fight was named by ''[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]'' as \"The Fight of the Year.\"\n\nFor his next bout, Foreman chose to face [[Joe Frazier]] in a rematch. Frazier was then the world's #3 heavyweight per ''the Ring''.<Ref>[https://boxrec.com/media/index.php/The_Ring_Magazine%27s_Annual_Ratings:_1975 The Ring Magazine's Annual Ratings: 1975]</ref> Because of the one-sided Foreman victory in their first fight, and the fact that Frazier had taken a tremendous amount of punishment from Ali in Manila a year earlier, few expected him to win. Frazier at this point was 32\u20133, and Foreman was 41\u20131. However, the 2nd Foreman-Frazier fight was fairly competitive for its duration, as Frazier used quick head movements to make Foreman miss with his hardest punches.   Frazier was wearing a contact lens for his vision which was knocked loose during the bout. After being unable to mount a significant offense, Frazier was eventually floored twice by Foreman in the fifth round and the fight was stopped. Next, Foreman knocked out [[Scott LeDoux]] in three rounds and prospect John Dino Denis in four to finish the year.\n\n===Retirement and spiritual rebirth===\n[[File:Foreman as reverend.jpg|thumb|180px|Foreman as reverend at the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ, 1994]]\n1977 proved to be a life changing year for Foreman. After knocking out Pedro Agosto in four rounds at [[Pensacola, Florida]], Foreman flew to [[Puerto Rico]] a day before the fight without giving himself time to acclimatize. His opponent was the skilled boxer [[Jimmy Young (boxer)|Jimmy Young]], who had beaten [[Ron Lyle]] and lost a very controversial decision to Muhammad Ali the previous year. Foreman fought cautiously early on, allowing Young to settle into the fight. Young constantly complained about Foreman pushing him, for which Foreman eventually had a point deducted by the referee, although Young was never warned for his persistent holding. Foreman badly hurt Young in round 7 but was unable to land a finishing blow. Foreman, tired during the second half of the fight and suffered a knockdown in round 12 en route to losing a decision.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nForeman became ill in his dressing room after the fight. He was suffering from exhaustion and [[heatstroke]] and stated he had a [[near-death experience]]. He spoke of being in a hellish, frightening place of nothingness and despair, and realized that he was in the midst of death. Though not yet religious, he began to plead with God to help him. He explained that he sensed God asking him to change his life and ways. When he said, \"I don't care if this is death \u2013 I still believe there is a God\", he felt a hand pull him out and sensed that he was also suffering [[stigmata]].{{citation needed|reason=sourced only to own website|date=April 2017}} After this experience, Foreman became a [[Born again Christianity|born-again Christian]], dedicating his life for the next decade to God. Although he did not formally retire from boxing, Foreman stopped fighting and became an ordained minister, initially preaching on street corners before becoming the reverend at the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://texasarchive.org/2017_00606|title=George Foreman and the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ (1980)|last=|first=|date=|website=Texas Archive of the Moving Image|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 12, 2019}}</ref> in Houston<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.georgeforeman.com/church |title=The Official Site of George Foreman |website=Georgeforeman.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-25}}</ref> and devoting himself to his family and his congregation. He also opened a youth center<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.georgeforeman.com/youthcenter.html |title=George Foreman Youth Center, Houston |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609073250/http://www.georgeforeman.com/youthcenter.html |archivedate=June 9, 2007 }}</ref> that bears his name. Foreman continues to speak about his experience on Christian television broadcasts such as ''[[The 700 Club]]'' and the [[Trinity Broadcasting Network]] and later joked that Young had knocked the devil out of him.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n===Second comeback===\nIn 1987, after 10 years away from the ring, Foreman surprised the boxing world by announcing a comeback at the age of 38. In his autobiography, he wrote that his primary motive was to raise money to fund the youth center he had created, which had required much of the money he had earned in the initial phase of his career. Another stated ambition was to fight [[Mike Tyson]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://coxscorner.tripod.com/foreman_tyson_fl.html |title=Why We Never Saw Foreman-Tyson |website=Coxscorner.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-25}}</ref> For his first fight, he went to [[Sacramento, California]], where he beat [[Journeyman (boxing)|journeyman]] Steve Zouski by a knockout in four rounds. Foreman weighed {{convert|267|lb|abbr=on}} for the fight and looked badly out of shape. Although many thought his decision to return to the ring was a mistake, Foreman countered that he had returned to prove that age was not a barrier to people achieving their goals (as he said later, he wanted to show that age 40 is not a \"death sentence\"). He won four more bouts that year, gradually slimming down and improving his fitness. In 1988, he won nine times. Perhaps his most notable win during this period was a seventh-round knockout of former Light Heavyweight and [[Cruiserweight (boxing)|Cruiserweight]] Champion [[Dwight Muhammad Qawi]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nHaving always been a deliberate fighter, Foreman had not lost much mobility in the ring since his first \"retirement\", although he found it harder to keep his balance after throwing big punches and could no longer throw rapid combinations. He was still capable of landing heavy single blows, however. The late-round fatigue that had plagued him in the ring as a young man now seemed to be unexpectedly gone, and he could comfortably compete for 12 rounds. Foreman attributed this to his new, relaxed fighting style (he has spoken of how, earlier in his career, his lack of stamina came from an enormous amount of nervous tension).{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nBy 1989, while continuing his comeback, Foreman had sold his name and face for the advertising of various products, selling everything from [[George Foreman Grill|grills]] to [[muffler]]s on TV. For this purpose{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} his public persona was reinvented, and the formerly aloof, ominous Foreman had been replaced by a smiling, friendly George. He and Ali had become friends, and he followed in Ali's footsteps by making himself a celebrity outside the boundaries of boxing.\n\nForeman continued his string of victories, winning five more fights, the most impressive being a three-round win over [[Bert Cooper]], who went on to contest the Undisputed Heavyweight title against [[Evander Holyfield]].\n\n===Foreman vs. Cooney===\n{{Main|George Foreman vs. Gerry Cooney}}\nIn 1990, Foreman met former title challenger [[Gerry Cooney]] in Atlantic City. Cooney was coming off a long period of inactivity, but was well regarded for his punching power. Cooney wobbled Foreman in the first round, but Foreman landed several powerful punches in the second round. Cooney was knocked down twice and Foreman scored a devastating KO. Foreman went on to win four more fights that year.\n\n===Foreman vs. Holyfield===\n{{Main|Evander Holyfield vs. George Foreman}}\nThe following year, Foreman was given the opportunity to challenge undisputed heavyweight champion [[Evander Holyfield]], who was in tremendous shape at 208 pounds, for the world title in a [[pay-per-view]] boxing event. Very few boxing experts gave the 42-year-old Foreman a chance of winning. Foreman, who weighed in at 257 pounds, began the contest by marching forward, absorbing several of Holyfield's best combinations and occasionally landing a powerful swing of his own. Holyfield proved too tough and agile to knock down and was well ahead on points throughout the fight, but Foreman surprised many by lasting the full 12 rounds, losing his challenge on points. Round 7, in which Foreman knocked Holyfield off balance before being staggered by a powerful combination, was expected to be [[Ring Magazine round of the year|''Ring Magazine'''s \"Round of the Year\"]],{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} though no award was given in 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ringtv.craveonline.com/news/171651-past-winners-of-the-rings-year-end-awards|title=PAST WINNERS OF THE RING'S YEAR-END AWARDS \u2013 Ring TV|author=THE RING|date=24 February 2012|work=Ring TV|accessdate=12 September 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160320110422/http://ringtv.craveonline.com/news/171651-past-winners-of-the-rings-year-end-awards|archivedate=20 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nA year later, Foreman fought journeyman [[Alex Stewart (boxer)|Alex Stewart]], who had previously been stopped in the first round by [[Mike Tyson]]. Foreman knocked down Stewart twice in the second round but expended a lot of energy in doing so. He was subsequently tired, and Stewart rebounded. By the end of the 10th and final round, Foreman's face was bloodied and swollen, but the judges awarded him a  majority decision win.\n\n===Foreman vs. Morrison===\n{{Main|George Foreman vs. Tommy Morrison}}\nIn 1993, Foreman received another title shot, although this was for the vacant [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] title. Foreman's opponent was [[Tommy Morrison]], a young prospect known for his punching power. Morrison retreated throughout the fight, refusing to trade toe-to-toe, and sometimes he turned his back on Foreman. The strategy paid off and he outboxed Foreman from long range. After 12 rounds, Morrison won a unanimous decision.\n\nIn this period, Foreman also starred briefly in the [[sitcom|situation comedy]] ''[[George (1993 TV series)|George]]'' on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].  The show, which featured Foreman as a retired boxer, premiered in November, 1993, and ran for ten episodes where nine aired.  The show was co-produced by actor and former boxer [[Tony Danza]].<ref>{{cite magazine|author=TV Guide |url= http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/george/cast/201620|title=George Cast and Details |magazine=TV Guide |accessdate=2012-09-07}}</ref>\n\n===Regaining the title: Foreman vs. Moorer===\n{{Main|Michael Moorer vs. George Foreman}}\n[[File:Elgrafico 3918 foreman.jpg|thumb|170px|Foreman celebrating his new world championship at 45 years old, after beating Michael Moorer]]\nIn 1994, Foreman again sought to challenge for the world championship after [[Michael Moorer]] had beaten Holyfield for the [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] and [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] titles.\n\nHaving lost his last fight against Morrison, Foreman was unranked and in no position to demand another title shot. His relatively high profile, however, made a title shot against Moorer, 19 years his junior, a lucrative prospect at seemingly little risk for the champion.\n\nForeman's title challenge against Moorer took place on November 5 in [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], with Foreman wearing the same red trunks he had worn in his title loss to Ali 20 years earlier. This time, however, Foreman was a substantial underdog. For nine rounds, Moorer easily outboxed him, hitting and moving away, while Foreman chugged forward, seemingly unable to \"pull the trigger\" on his punches. Entering the tenth round, Foreman was trailing on all scorecards. However, Foreman launched a comeback in the tenth round and hit Moorer with a number of punches. Then a short right hand caught Moorer on the tip of his chin, gashing open his bottom lip and he collapsed to the canvas. He lay flat on the canvas as the referee counted him out.\n\nIn an instant, Foreman had regained the title he had lost to Muhammad Ali two decades before. He went back to his corner and knelt in prayer as the arena erupted in cheers. With this historic victory, Foreman broke three records: he became, at age 45, the oldest fighter ever to win a World Championship; 20 years after losing his title for the first time, he broke the record for the fighter with the longest interval between his first and second world championships; and the age spread of 19 years between the champion and challenger was the largest of any heavyweight boxing championship fight.\n\n===Foreman vs. Schulz===\n\n====Prelude====\nShortly after the 1994 Moorer fight, Foreman began talking about a potential superfight with [[Mike Tyson]], then the youngest heavyweight champion on record. In 1995, ''The New York Times'' quoted Foreman as stating, \"If he doesn't sign with [[Don King (boxing promoter)#Mike Tyson|Don King]], we'll fight before the end of the year... I can't be bothered having trouble with Don King. Every contract has some complication.\"<ref>{{cite news |last= Eskenazi|first= Gerald|date= February 15, 1995|title= The Jewel in Foreman's Crown?

For reasons not clearly known, Foreman refused to fight Tucker and allowed the WBA to strip him of that belt.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n====Schulz match====\n{{Main|George Foreman vs. Axel Schulz}}\nOn April 22, 1995, Foreman fought mid-level underdog prospect [[Axel Schulz]], of Germany, in defense of his remaining IBF title. Schulz jabbed strongly from long range, and exhibited increasing confidence as the fight progressed. Foreman finished the fight with a swelling over one eye, but was awarded a controversial majority decision. The IBF ordered an immediate rematch to be held in Germany; Foreman refused the terms and was stripped of his remaining title, yet continued to be recognized as the [[Lineal championship|Lineal Heavyweight Champion]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n===Losing the title: Foreman vs. Briggs===\n{{Main|George Foreman vs. Shannon Briggs}}\nIn 1996, Foreman returned to Tokyo, scoring an easy win over the unrated [[Crawford Grimsley]] by a 12-round decision. In 1997, he faced contender [[Lou Savarese]], winning a close decision in a grueling, competitive encounter. Then, yet another opportunity came Foreman's way as the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] decided to match him against [[Shannon Briggs]] in a 1997 \"eliminator bout\" for the right to face WBC champion [[Lennox Lewis]]. After 12 rounds, in which Foreman consistently rocked Briggs with power punches, almost everyone at ringside saw Foreman as the clear winner.<ref>{{cite news |first=Timothy W. |last=Smith |title=BOXING; Briggs Wins, Crowd Boos and Foreman Says He Likely Won't Fight Again |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/23/sports/boxing-briggs-wins-crowd-boos-and-foreman-says-he-likely-won-t-fight-again.html |work=New York Times |date=November 23, 1997 |access-date=January 26, 2017}}</ref> Once again there was a controversial decision\u2014but this time it went in favor of Foreman's opponent, with Briggs awarded a points win.

However, he did plan a return bout against [[Larry Holmes]] in 1999, scheduled to take place at the Houston [[Astrodome]] on pay per view. The fight was to be billed as \"The Birthday Bash\" due to both fighters' upcoming birthdays. Foreman was set to make $10 million and Holmes was to make $4 million, but negotiations fell through and the fight was cancelled. With a continuing affinity for the sport, Foreman became a respected boxing analyst for HBO.\n\nForeman said he had no plans to resume his career as a boxer, but then announced in February 2004 that he was training for one more comeback fight to demonstrate that the age of 55, like 40, is not a \"death sentence.\" The bout, against an unspecified opponent (rumored to be [[Trevor Berbick]]), never materialized (it was widely thought that Foreman's wife had been a major factor in the change of plans). George Foreman left the sport of boxing after leaving HBO to pursue other opportunities.\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:GeorgeForemanSept09.jpg|thumb|right|Foreman speaking in Houston, Texas, in September 2009]]\nForeman has been married to Mary Joan Martelly since 1985.

He was [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] from 2016 to 2018 and [[Mayor of London]] from [[2008 London mayoral election|2008]] to 2016. Johnson was [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] for [[Henley (UK Parliament constituency)|Henley]] from [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]] to [[2008 Henley by-election|2008]] and has been MP for [[Uxbridge and South Ruislip (UK Parliament constituency)|Uxbridge and South Ruislip]] since [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]]. Ideologically, Johnson identifies as a [[one-nation conservative]].\n\n<!--Early life, journalism, and early political career-->\nJohnson was born in New York City to upper-middle-class [[English people|English]] parents and educated at [[Eton College]]. He read [[Literae Humaniores|Classics]] at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], where he was elected [[President of the Oxford Union]] in 1986. He began his career in journalism at ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper but was dismissed for falsifying a quotation. He later became the Brussels correspondent for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' newspaper and his articles exerted a strong influence on growing [[Eurosceptic]] sentiment on the British right. He was promoted to an assistant editor from 1994 to 1999, and edited ''[[The Spectator]]'' magazine from 1999 to 2005.\n\nHe was elected MP for Henley in 2001, and served as a [[Shadow Cabinet|Junior Shadow Minister]] under Conservative leaders [[Michael Howard]] and [[David Cameron]]. He largely adhered to the Conservatives' [[party line (politics)|party line]] but adopted a [[Cultural liberalism|socially liberal]] stance on issues such as [[LGBT rights in the United Kingdom|LGBT rights]] in parliamentary votes. He [[resigned from the British House of Commons|resigned as an MP]] and in [[2008 London mayoral election|2008]] was elected Mayor of London, being re-elected in [[2012 London mayoral election|2012]]. During his mayoralty he oversaw the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], introduced the [[New Routemaster]] buses, a [[Santander Cycles|cycle hire scheme]] and a [[Emirates Air Line (cable car)|cable car crossing the Thames]], and banned alcohol consumption on much of London's public transport.\n\n<!--Post-Mayoral career-->\nIn 2015, Johnson was [[2015 United Kingdom general election|elected]] MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip, stepping down as mayor the following year. In 2016, he became a prominent figure in the successful [[Vote Leave]] campaign for [[Brexit]]. He then served as [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs]] under [[Theresa May]]'s premiership \u2013 a post from which [[List of departures from the second May ministry|he resigned]] in criticism of May's approach to Brexit and the [[Chequers Agreement]] two years later. After May resigned in 2019, he was [[2019 Conservative Party leadership election|elected]] Conservative leader and appointed prime minister. His [[2019 British prorogation controversy|September 2019 prorogation of]] [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] was ruled unlawful by the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]].<ref name=\"prorogationtechnicality\">Formally, Parliament is prorogued by Her Majesty the Queen on the advice of the Prime Minister; it is a common [[legal fiction]] in the U.K. that many executive functions of the Prime Minister are formally carried out by the Queen on the Prime Minister's \"advice,\" which is effectively the legal instrument by which the Prime Minister carries out the function. It was this advice of Johnson's that was ruled unlawful, not the actions of Her Majesty.</ref> In the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]], Johnson led the Conservative Party to their biggest victory since 1987, and biggest percentage vote share of any party since 1979.

Avoid WP:RECENTISM-->\n\n<!--Reception, legacy, and influence-->\nJohnson is a controversial figure in British politics and journalism. Supporters have praised him as an entertaining, humorous, and popular figure, with an appeal stretching beyond traditional Conservative voters and [[Euroscepticism|eurosceptics]]. Conversely, his critics have accused him of dishonesty, [[elitism]], and [[cronyism]], and of using offensive language.

June 1964) is a British politician, writer, and former journalist serving as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] and [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|Leader of the Conservative Party]] since 2019. He was [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] from 2016 to 2018 and [[Mayor of London]] from [[2008 London mayoral election|2008]] to 2016. Johnson was [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] for [[Henley (UK Parliament constituency)|Henley]] from [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]] to [[2008 Henley by-election|2008]] and has been MP for [[Uxbridge and South Ruislip (UK Parliament constituency)|Uxbridge and South Ruislip]] since [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]]. Ideologically, Johnson identifies as a [[one-nation conservative]].\n\n<!--Early life, journalism, and early political career-->\nJohnson was born in New York City to upper-middle-class [[English people|English]] parents and educated at [[Eton College]]. He read [[Literae Humaniores|Classics]] at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], where he was elected [[President of the Oxford Union]] in 1986. He began his career in journalism at ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper but was dismissed for falsifying a quotation. He later became the Brussels correspondent for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' newspaper and his articles exerted a strong influence on growing [[Eurosceptic]] sentiment on the British right. He was promoted to an assistant editor from 1994 to 1999, and edited ''[[The Spectator]]'' magazine from 1999 to 2005.\n\nHe was elected MP for Henley in 2001, and served as a [[Shadow Cabinet|Junior Shadow Minister]] under Conservative leaders [[Michael Howard]] and [[David Cameron]]. He largely adhered to the Conservatives' [[party line (politics)|party line]] but adopted a [[Cultural liberalism|socially liberal]] stance on issues such as [[LGBT rights in the United Kingdom|LGBT rights]] in parliamentary votes. He [[resigned from the British House of Commons|resigned as an MP]] and in [[2008 London mayoral election|2008]] was elected Mayor of London, being re-elected in [[2012 London mayoral election|2012]]. During his mayoralty he oversaw the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], introduced the [[New Routemaster]] buses, a [[Santander Cycles|cycle hire scheme]] and a [[Emirates Air Line (cable car)|cable car crossing the Thames]], and banned alcohol consumption on much of London's public transport.\n\n<!--Post-Mayoral career-->\nIn 2015, Johnson was [[2015 United Kingdom general election|elected]] MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip, stepping down as mayor the following year. In 2016, he became a prominent figure in the successful [[Vote Leave]] campaign for [[Brexit]]. He then served as [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs]] under [[Theresa May]]'s premiership \u2013 a post from which [[List of departures from the second May ministry|he resigned]] in criticism of May's approach to Brexit and the [[Chequers Agreement]] two years later. After May resigned in 2019, he was [[2019 Conservative Party leadership election|elected]] Conservative leader and appointed prime minister. His [[2019 British prorogation controversy|September 2019 prorogation of]] [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] was ruled unlawful by the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]].<ref name=\"prorogationtechnicality\">Formally, Parliament is prorogued by Her Majesty the Queen on the advice of the Prime Minister; it is a common [[legal fiction]] in the U.K. that many executive functions of the Prime Minister are formally carried out by the Queen on the Prime Minister's \"advice,\" which is effectively the legal instrument by which the Prime Minister carries out the function. It was this advice of Johnson's that was ruled unlawful, not the actions of Her Majesty.</ref> In the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]], Johnson led the Conservative Party to their biggest victory since 1987, and biggest percentage vote share of any party since 1979.

Supporters have praised him as an entertaining, humorous, and popular figure, with an appeal stretching beyond traditional Conservative voters and [[Euroscepticism|eurosceptics]]. Conversely, his critics have accused him of dishonesty, [[elitism]], and [[cronyism]], and of using offensive language.

While the foundation has discouraged (and occasionally taken legal action against) individuals and organizations that have used the Nobel name to refer to prizes not meeting the aforementioned criteria,<ref name=\"nobel foundation\"/> several prominent individuals and organizations have nonetheless used the label \"Nobel Prize of X\" to refer to highly prestigious awards in fields of activity not recognized by the \"real\" Nobel Prizes. These awards are listed below.\n\nWhile the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences was not originally endowed by Alfred Nobel, it is sponsored and administered by the Nobel Foundation, and generally recognized as the \"Nobel Prize in Economics.\" Due to this recognition it is included in the list below.\n\n== Prizes sponsored by the Nobel Foundation ==\nAlfred Nobel's last will of 1895 only included five prizes, covering outstanding achievements who confer the \"greatest benefit on mankind\" in the fields of chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine. The original Nobel prizes thus includes:\n* [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]]\n* [[Nobel Prize in Physics]]\n* [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]\n* [[Nobel Peace Prize]]\n* [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]]\n\nIn addition to the prizes listed above, the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] is sponsored by the Nobel Foundation. The foundation has trademarked the term \"Nobel Prize\" and this designation cannot be legally used to refer to any prizes other than the five original Nobels.<ref name=\"nobel foundation\"/>\n\n== Prizes not sponsored by the Nobel Foundation ==\nSeveral prizes in fields of study and achievement not covered by the original Nobel Prizes have been established by various entities. These have been referred to as the \"Nobel Prize of\" that particular field, in the vast majority of cases without the approval of the Nobel Foundation. These prizes are generally the highest awards in their fields. For some fields, more than one prestigious prizes are listed below. Some most important prizes in the world are presented in bold.

Each is to be awarded, every three years (initially every five years), for outstanding contributions to applied mathematics in the highest and broadest sense.

The Clark is known as the \"Baby Nobel\" in economics because around a third of the medalists have gone on to win the Nobel, the average age of whose laureates approaches 70 when they were awarded the prize. Similar prizes for young talent economists in the world include the [[Yrj\u00f6 Jahnsson Foundation#Yrj\u00f6 Jahnsson Award|Yrj\u00f6 Jahnsson Award]] (1993), the European equivalent awarded to European economists under '''45''' years of age; the [[Nakahara Prize]] (1995) awarded to Japanese economists under '''45''' years of age; the [[Gossen Prize]] (1997) awarded to German-speaking economists under '''45''' years of age;  the [[Prix du meilleur jeune \u00e9conomiste de France|Prix du Meilleur Jeune \u00c9conomiste de France]] (2000) awarded to French economists under '''40''' years of age; and the [[Assar Lindbeck Medal]] (2007) awarded to Swedish economists under '''45''' years of age. \n* 2: The John von Neumann Award, which honors professors with top contributions to economics and social sciences, is distinguished from other scientific awards on the basis that it is given by students. The students at the [[Rajk L\u00e1szl\u00f3 College for Advanced Studies]] ([[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]), which is a self governing community of about 100 selected students living together, elect the nominees and vote for the prize-winner in the Assembly of the College after a review and debate regarding the candidates every year. Recipients are invited to the college to receive the award, give an open lecture and hold a master class. It also needs to be noted that there are three other prizes named after Hungarian-American polymath [[John von Neumann]] in this prize list, the [[#Applied mathematics|SIAM John von Neumann Lecture]] (1960) for distinguished contributions to the field of applied mathematical sciences, the [[#Computer science|IEEE John von Neumann Medal]] (1992) for outstanding achievements in computer-related science and technology, and the [[#Operations research|INFORMS John von Neumann Theory Prize]] (1975) for fundamental and sustained contributions to theory in operations research and the management sciences.\n}}</small>\n\n====Electrical engineering====\n* '''[[IEEE Medal of Honor]]''' (1917)<ref name=ee/>\n* [[IET Faraday Medal|Faraday Medal]] (1922)<ref name=ee/>\n* [[IEEE Edison Medal|Edison Medal]] (1909)<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8290600|title=Origins of the IEEE Edison Medal| journal = Proceedings of the IEEE | volume = 106| issue = 2| pages = 319\u2013328| issn =0018-9219|doi = 10.1109/JPROC.2018.2790278|author=David P.

While the foundation has discouraged (and occasionally taken legal action against) individuals and organizations that have used the Nobel name to refer to prizes not meeting the aforementioned criteria,<ref name=\"nobel foundation\"/> several prominent individuals and organizations have nonetheless used the label \"Nobel Prize of X\" to refer to highly prestigious awards in fields of activity not recognized by the \"real\" Nobel Prizes.

The recipient must be a member of one of the two societies. In 1967, these two prizes were established at the same time. The initial contribution for the Birkhoff Prize came from the Birkhoff family and for the Wiener Prize from the Mathematics Department of the Massachusettes Institute of Technology. Each is to be awarded, every three years (initially every five years), for outstanding contributions to applied mathematics in the highest and broadest sense. In the early years, the Birkhoff Prize was awarded at an AMS meeting and the Wiener Prize at a SIAM meeting.

The Clark is known as the \"Baby Nobel\" in economics because around a third of the medalists have gone on to win the Nobel, the average age of whose laureates approaches 70 when they were awarded the prize. Similar prizes for young talent economists in the world include the [[Yrj\u00f6 Jahnsson Foundation#Yrj\u00f6 Jahnsson Award|Yrj\u00f6 Jahnsson Award]] (1993), the European equivalent awarded to European economists under '''45''' years of age; the [[Nakahara Prize]] (1995) awarded to Japanese economists under '''45''' years of age; the [[Gossen Prize]] (1997) awarded to German-speaking economists under '''45''' years of age;  the [[Prix du meilleur jeune \u00e9conomiste de France|Prix du Meilleur Jeune \u00c9conomiste de France]] (2000) awarded to French economists under '''40''' years of age; and the [[Assar Lindbeck Medal]] (2007) awarded to Swedish economists under '''45''' years of age. \n* 2: The John von Neumann Award, which honors professors with top contributions to economics and social sciences, is distinguished from other scientific awards on the basis that it is given by students. The students at the [[Rajk L\u00e1szl\u00f3 College for Advanced Studies]] ([[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]), which is a self governing community of about 100 selected students living together, elect the nominees and vote for the prize-winner in the Assembly of the College after a review and debate regarding the candidates every year. Recipients are invited to the college to receive the award, give an open lecture and hold a master class. It also needs to be noted that there are three other prizes named after Hungarian-American polymath [[John von Neumann]] in this prize list, the [[#Applied mathematics|SIAM John von Neumann Lecture]] (1960) for distinguished contributions to the field of applied mathematical sciences, the [[#Computer science|IEEE John von Neumann Medal]] (1992) for outstanding achievements in computer-related science and technology, and the [[#Operations research|INFORMS John von Neumann Theory Prize]] (1975) for fundamental and sustained contributions to theory in operations research and the management sciences.\n}}</small>\n\n====Electrical engineering====\n* '''[[IEEE Medal of Honor]]''' (1917)<ref name=ee/>\n* [[IET Faraday Medal|Faraday Medal]] (1922)<ref name=ee/>\n* [[IEEE Edison Medal|Edison Medal]] (1909)<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8290600|title=Origins of the IEEE Edison Medal| journal = Proceedings of the IEEE | volume = 106| issue = 2| pages = 319\u2013328| issn =0018-9219|doi = 10.1109/JPROC.2018.2790278|author=David P.

When Devala returned after obtaining threads from [[Lord Vishnu]]'s lotus navel, a group of five demons, Vajramushti, Dhoomravakra, Dhoomratchasa, Chithrasena and Panchasena, attacked him at midnight. In the dark, the power of the demons was overwhelming. Devala attempted to fight them off using Vishnu's [[Sudarshana Chakra]], but failed, and finally prayed for [[Shakti]] to protect him. Shakti appeared in light and glory, wearing a bright full crown, holding a trident and other weapons in her hand while mounted on a lion. She killed the demons; their blood was white, black, red, green, and yellow. Devala soaked his threads in the demon's colorful blood. Shakti was then given the name [[Chowdeshwari Temple|Chowdeshwari]] or Sowdeswari (Chowda/Sowda/Sooda=the brightness). Sowdeswari advised Devala to worship her during every new moon (Amavasya).<ref name=\"devangakula.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.devangakula.org/AaadiAmavaasai.html|title=speciality of Aashada New Moon Day - \u0b86\u0b9f\u0bbf \u0b85\u0bae\u0bbe\u0bb5\u0bbe\u0b9a\u0bc8 \u0b9a\u0bbf\u0bb1\u0baa\u0bcd\u0baa\u0bc1|website=Devangakula.org|accessdate=14 June 2019}}</ref> \n\nDevala went to the south [[Himalaya|Himalayas]] and founded Sagara Kingdom with Amodh Nagar as its capital.

He invited Lord Shiva and Parvathi from Srisailam to the temple but on the way Parvathi disappeared in the water as Devadas broke his promise. Devadas and his soldiers then wounded themselves with swords and suddenly the goddess appeared and joined them.<ref>[http://www.tamilvu.org/courses/degree/a061/a0614/html/a0614225.htm] {{dead link|date=June 2019}}</ref> The [[Alagu Sevai|alagu seva]] ritual commemorates this event and invokes Sowdeswari Amman.

When Devala returned after obtaining threads from [[Lord Vishnu]]'s lotus navel, a group of five demons, Vajramushti, Dhoomravakra, Dhoomratchasa, Chithrasena and Panchasena, attacked him at midnight. In the dark, the power of the demons was overwhelming. Devala attempted to fight them off using Vishnu's [[Sudarshana Chakra]], but failed, and finally prayed for [[Shakti]] to protect him. Shakti appeared in light and glory, wearing a bright full crown, holding a trident and other weapons in her hand while mounted on a lion. She killed the demons; their blood was white, black, red, green, and yellow. Devala soaked his threads in the demon's colorful blood. Shakti was then given the name [[Chowdeshwari Temple|Chowdeshwari]] or Sowdeswari (Chowda/Sowda/Sooda=the brightness).

It is known as Avani Avittam in Tamil Nadu and Kerala.\n* Yearly Festival (Varusha Habba): The yearly festival of Sowdeswari Amman Temple usually falls during the season of [[Navratri]] but varies depending on the tradition of the area. It includes [[Alagu Sevai]], Shakti [[Chamunda]] Jyothi pooja, Manja Neer Meravana, and Amman Beethi Ulaa.
