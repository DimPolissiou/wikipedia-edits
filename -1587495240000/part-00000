As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the total population was 743,159,<ref name=\"QF\">{{cite web|title=State & County QuickFacts|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/25/25009.html|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=5 September 2013|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/603tjOJkP?url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/25/25009.html|archive-date=10 July 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> making it the third-most populous county in the state. It is part of the [[Greater Boston]] area (the [[Boston]]\u2013[[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]]\u2013[[Newton, Massachusetts|Newton]], MA\u2013[[New Hampshire|NH]] [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]]). The largest city in Essex County is [[Lynn, Massachusetts|Lynn]]. The county was named after the [[England|English]] county of [[Essex]].\n\nIt has two traditional [[county seat]]s: [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]] and [[Lawrence, Massachusetts|Lawrence]]. Prior to the dissolution of the county government in 1999, Salem had jurisdiction over the Southern Essex District, and Lawrence had jurisdiction over the Northern Essex District, but currently these cities do not function as seats of government. However, the county and the districts remain as administrative regions recognized by various governmental agencies, which gathered vital statistics or disposed of judicial case loads under these geographic subdivisions, and are required to keep the records based on them. The county has been designated the [[Essex National Heritage Area]] by the [[National Park Service]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:The Gerry-Mander Edit.png|thumb|left|246px|Printed in 1812, this political cartoon illustrates the electoral districts drawn by the [[Massachusetts]] legislature to favor the incumbent [[Democratic-Republican]] party candidates of Governor [[Elbridge Gerry]] over the [[Federalists]], from which the term ''[[gerrymandering|gerrymander]]'' is derived. The cartoon depicts the bizarre shape of a district in Essex County as a \"Gerry-Mander, A new species of ''Monster'', (...) that (...) belongs to the ''Salamander'' tribe (...)\".]]\n\nThe county was created by the General Court of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] on May 10, 1643, when it was ordered \"that the whole [[Massachusetts Bay Colony|plantation]] within this jurisdiction be divided into four [[Shire|sheires]]\". Named after the [[Essex|county in England]], Essex then comprised the towns of [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]], [[Lynn, Massachusetts|Lynn]], [[Wenham, Massachusetts|Wenham]], [[Ipswich, Massachusetts|Ipswich]], [[Rowley, Massachusetts|Rowley]], [[Newbury, Massachusetts|Newbury]], [[Gloucester, Massachusetts|Gloucester]], and [[Andover, Massachusetts|Andover]].<ref>Davis, William T. ''Bench and Bar of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts'', p. 44. The Boston History Company, 1895.</ref> In 1680, [[Haverhill, Massachusetts|Haverhill]] and [[Salisbury, Massachusetts|Salisbury]], both located north of the [[Merrimack River]], were annexed to Essex County. These communities had been part of Massachusetts' [[Norfolk County, Massachusetts Colony|colonial-era Norfolk County]]. The remaining four towns within colonial Norfolk County, which included [[Exeter, New Hampshire|Exeter]] and what is now [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire|Portsmouth]], were transferred to what became [[Rockingham County, New Hampshire|Rockingham County]] in the [[Province of New Hampshire]]. The ten large founding Massachusetts-based settlements were then subdivided over the centuries to produce Essex County's modern composition of cities and towns.\n\nEssex County is where [[Elbridge Gerry]] (who was born and raised in [[Marblehead, Massachusetts|Marblehead]]) created a legislative district in 1812 that gave rise to the word ''[[gerrymandering]]''.\n\nDue to a confluence of floods, hurricanes, and severe winter storms, Essex County has had more disaster declarations than most other U.S. counties, from 1964 to 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newamerica.org/in-depth/weather-eye/frequency-disaster-declarations/|title=Frequency of Disaster Declarations|author=|date=|website=New America}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newamerica.org/in-depth/weather-eye-stories-front/essex-county-massachusetts/|title=Essex County, Massachusetts|author=|date=|website=New America}}</ref>\n\n== Law and government ==\nFrom the founding of the Republican Party until the New Deal, Essex County was a Republican stronghold in presidential elections. Since 1936, it has trended Democratic, with [[Dwight Eisenhower]] in 1952 and 1956 and [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1980 and 1984 being the only Republicans to carry the county since.\n{{Hidden begin\n|titlestyle = background:#ccccff;\n|title      = Presidential elections results\n}}\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''Presidential election results'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS|title=Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections|first=David|last=Leip|date=|website=uselectionatlas.org}}</ref>\n|- bgcolor=lightgrey\n!

The area includes 34 cities and towns; two National Historic Sites (Salem Maritime National Historic Site and Saugus Iron Works National Historic Site); and thousands of historic sites and districts that illuminate colonial settlement, the development of the shoe and textile industries, and the growth and decline of the maritime industries, including fishing, privateering, and the China trade.<ref>''The National Parks: Index 2001-2003,'' Washington, D.C.: [[National Park Service]], p. 104.</ref> The Essex National Heritage Area<ref>[http://www.essexheritage.org/ Essex National Heritage Area]</ref> is one of 49 heritage areas designated by Congress, affiliated with the National Park Service.\n\nThe [[Essex National Heritage Commission]] is a non-profit organization chartered to promote tourism and cultural awareness of the area, connecting people to the places of Essex County, MA. The Commission's mission is to promote and preserve the historic, cultural and natural resources of the ENHA by rallying community support around saving the character of the area.

It is part of the [[Greater Boston]] area (the [[Boston]]\u2013[[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]]\u2013[[Newton, Massachusetts|Newton]], MA\u2013[[New Hampshire|NH]] [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]]). The largest city in Essex County is [[Lynn, Massachusetts|Lynn]]. The county was named after the [[England|English]] county of [[Essex]].\n\nIt has two traditional [[county seat]]s: [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]] and [[Lawrence, Massachusetts|Lawrence]]. Prior to the dissolution of the county government in 1999, Salem had jurisdiction over the Southern Essex District, and Lawrence had jurisdiction over the Northern Essex District, but currently these cities do not function as seats of government. However, the county and the districts remain as administrative regions recognized by various governmental agencies, which gathered vital statistics or disposed of judicial case loads under these geographic subdivisions, and are required to keep the records based on them. The county has been designated the [[Essex National Heritage Area]] by the [[National Park Service]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:The Gerry-Mander Edit.png|thumb|left|246px|Printed in 1812, this political cartoon illustrates the electoral districts drawn by the [[Massachusetts]] legislature to favor the incumbent [[Democratic-Republican]] party candidates of Governor [[Elbridge Gerry]] over the [[Federalists]], from which the term ''[[gerrymandering|gerrymander]]'' is derived. The cartoon depicts the bizarre shape of a district in Essex County as a \"Gerry-Mander, A new species of ''Monster'', (...) that (...) belongs to the ''Salamander'' tribe (...)\".]]\n\nThe county was created by the General Court of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] on May 10, 1643, when it was ordered \"that the whole [[Massachusetts Bay Colony|plantation]] within this jurisdiction be divided into four [[Shire|sheires]]\". Named after the [[Essex|county in England]], Essex then comprised the towns of [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]], [[Lynn, Massachusetts|Lynn]], [[Wenham, Massachusetts|Wenham]], [[Ipswich, Massachusetts|Ipswich]], [[Rowley, Massachusetts|Rowley]], [[Newbury, Massachusetts|Newbury]], [[Gloucester, Massachusetts|Gloucester]], and [[Andover, Massachusetts|Andover]].<ref>Davis, William T. ''Bench and Bar of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts'', p. 44. The Boston History Company, 1895.</ref> In 1680, [[Haverhill, Massachusetts|Haverhill]] and [[Salisbury, Massachusetts|Salisbury]], both located north of the [[Merrimack River]], were annexed to Essex County. These communities had been part of Massachusetts' [[Norfolk County, Massachusetts Colony|colonial-era Norfolk County]]. The remaining four towns within colonial Norfolk County, which included [[Exeter, New Hampshire|Exeter]] and what is now [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire|Portsmouth]], were transferred to what became [[Rockingham County, New Hampshire|Rockingham County]] in the [[Province of New Hampshire]]. The ten large founding Massachusetts-based settlements were then subdivided over the centuries to produce Essex County's modern composition of cities and towns.\n\nEssex County is where [[Elbridge Gerry]] (who was born and raised in [[Marblehead, Massachusetts|Marblehead]]) created a legislative district in 1812 that gave rise to the word ''[[gerrymandering]]''.\n\nDue to a confluence of floods, hurricanes, and severe winter storms, Essex County has had more disaster declarations than most other U.S. counties, from 1964 to 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newamerica.org/in-depth/weather-eye/frequency-disaster-declarations/|title=Frequency of Disaster Declarations|author=|date=|website=New America}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newamerica.org/in-depth/weather-eye-stories-front/essex-county-massachusetts/|title=Essex County, Massachusetts|author=|date=|website=New America}}</ref>\n\n== Law and government ==\nFrom the founding of the Republican Party until the New Deal, Essex County was a Republican stronghold in presidential elections. Since 1936, it has trended Democratic, with [[Dwight Eisenhower]] in 1952 and 1956 and [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1980 and 1984 being the only Republicans to carry the county since.\n{{Hidden begin\n|titlestyle = background:#ccccff;\n|title      = Presidential elections results\n}}\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''Presidential election results'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS|title=Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections|first=David|last=Leip|date=|website=uselectionatlas.org}}</ref>\n|- bgcolor=lightgrey\n!

All former county functions were assumed by state agencies in 1999. The sheriff (currently [[Kevin Coppinger (politician)|Kevin Coppinger]]) and some other regional officials with specific duties are still elected locally to perform duties within the county region, but there is no county council, commissioner, or county employees. Communities are now granted the right to form their own regional compacts for sharing services.

Carson entered her fourth marriage on April 28, 1951 to a 45-year-old Chicago drug store executive named William H. Newman.

She co-wrote with Al Hill, a pseudonym used by [[Fred Wise (lyricist)|Fred Wise]], Kathleen Twomey, and [[Ben Weisman]] the 1954 popular hit \"[[Let Me Go, Lover!]]\", first performed by 18-year-old [[Joan Weber]] and subsequently recorded by [[Hank Snow]], [[Teresa Brewer]], [[Peggy Lee]], [[Patti Page]], and [[Sunny Gale]]. \n \nHer song catalog contains over 170 songs which have been professionally recorded by more than 180 artists.\n\nIn 1971 she was inducted into the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]].\n\n==Married life==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2019}}\nOn July 16, 1934, at age 19, she married fellow [[National Barn Dance]] performer [[Red Blanchard|Donald Francis \"Red\" Blanchard]].  The marriage was doomed from the start.  They quickly separated and were divorced shortly thereafter. She immediately married 34-year-old Indiana native Myrl \"Jack\" Dumbauld on November 17, 1936, in Chicago, Illinois. After nine months the marriage was falling apart and they eventually separated several months later. It was not until September 1945 that Carson applied for and was granted a divorce from Dumbauld.\n\nOn May 1, 1946 Carson married 39-year-old [[Tiny Hill|Harry Lawrence \"Tiny\" Hill]], a successful [[big band]] entertainer. The couple had a successful business partnership with Hill performing many of Carson's songs. In January 1947 the Hills purchased a home in [[Ft. Wayne, Indiana]]. Their marriage was not successful, and Carson filed for divorce in April 1949; it became final on July 5, 1949. Carson entered her fourth marriage on April 28, 1951 to a 45-year-old Chicago drug store executive named William H. Newman.  Within two years Carson left Newman and moved to Texas with her mother.\n\n==Partial list of Carson's songs==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n*Ain'tcha Tired of Makin' Me Blue\n*A Pair of Broken Hearts (1945) (Co-written by [[Fred Rose (songwriter)|Fred Rose]])\n*A Penny For Your Thoughts (1947)\n*Another night is coming (1950) (Co-written by [[Moon Mullican]])\n*Blues in My Heart  (1949) (Co-written by Red Foley)\n*Chained to a Memory (1946)\n*C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S  (1949) (co-written by Eddy Arnold)\n*Darling, What More Can I Do?

This examination procedure is regulated in Chapter 19 of the VerfO. The condition for this is that the state explicitly rejected this when ratifying the treaty (Article 28 (1) FoK).<ref>{{cite web|title=R\u00f6mer Statut des Internationalen Strafgerichtshofs|publisher=Hrsg: [[Liechtensteinische Gesetzessammlung]] (LILEX)|url=https://www.gesetze.li/konso/2002090000|accessdate=2019-04-03}}</ref>\n\nThe state is asked by the committee to participate in the investigation proceedings and to provide information on these suspicions (Article 20 (1) FoK, Rule 82 et seq. First of all, the information received is examined (Rule 81 et seq. Of the VerfO) and, if the suspicion has been substantiated, an investigation is carried out, in which case the Committee can also conduct investigations in the affected state if the state agrees. Upon completion of the investigation, the committee will send the investigation report to the State concerned and, if it finds any instances of [[maladministration]], appropriate recommendations on how to remedy them (Rule 89 RCD).\n\nTo date, 10 such studies have been performed. [18] These were: Egypt (2017), [[Lebanon]] (2014), [[Nepal]] (2012), [[Brazil]] (2008), [[Serbia and Montenegro]] (2004), [[Mexico]] (2003), [[Sri Lanka]] (2002), [[Peru]] (2001), [[Egypt]] (1996), [[Turkey]] (1994)\n\nThe recommendations of the committee are not legally binding, their implementation can not be enforced. Apart from the fact that he can carry out a follow-up procedure<ref name=\"Working_methods_Follow-up_to_concluding_observations\" /><ref name=\"Follow-up_to_concluding_observations_procedure\" /> to review the implementation of the recommendations or that the implementation of the recommendations will be discussed in the next state report, no further measures are foreseen (Article 20 (5) FoK, Rule 90).\n\nIf the committee is confronted with such serious or systematic torture by a state, it may also bring the matter to the attention of the UN General Assembly. The latter then decide on the further course of action, because extensive or systematic violations of the torture prohibition are considered crimes against humanity according to Art. 7 (1) of the Rome Statute  and the International Criminal Court in The Hague is responsible for this, provided that the fallible state does not the [[International Criminal Court]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|periodical=[[Vertragssammlung der Vereinten Nationen|Vertragssammlung der UNO]]|url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XVIII-10&chapter=18&clang=_en|accessdate=2019-04-03|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==State cases==\nThis procedure is regulated in Chapter 20 of the VerfO. The Committee is empowered to consider cases of State where a Contracting State claims that another State Party is failing to fulfill its obligations under the Convention against Torture (Article 21 FoK). The condition for this is that both states explicitly recognized the competence of the committee when ratifying the treaty (Article 21 (1) FoK, Rule 91, 97 VerO).\n\nIn contrast to individual complaints, there are no high formal requirements for state complaints, and the UNHCHR Secretariat is not authorized to declare state complaints inadmissible, as in the case of individual complaints (Art. 22 (5) FoK Individual Complaints, Rule 111 ff.\n\nThe task of the committee is to settle the dispute (Article 21 (1) lit e FoK, Rule 98 of the Rules of Procedure). If no amicable agreement is reached, a final report will be prepared, completing the procedure for the committee (Article 21 (1) (h), (ii) FoK, Rule 101 of the VerfO). For international disputes, there are rules, u. a. the agreement for the peaceful settlement of international disputes <ref>{{cite web|title=Abkommen zur friedlichen Erledigung internationaler Streitf\u00e4lle|periodical=[[Liechtensteinische Gesetzessammlung]]|url=https://www.gesetze.li/konso/1995185000|accessdate=2019-04-03}}</ref> The states can then turn to the International Court of Justice<ref>{{cite web|title=Der Internationale Gerichtshof|periodical=[[Liechtensteinische Gesetzessammlung]]|url=https://www.gesetze.li/konso/1950006002|accessdate=2019-04-03}}</ref> within six months, provided that neither of the two states made a reservation in the ratification of the treaty (Article 30 FoK).\n\nAs a precautionary measure, 12 states rejected the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice when concluding the contract (Article 30 (1) FoK).\n\nStates do not necessarily have to refer to the International Court of Justice, there is also a European Convention on the Peaceful Settlement of Disputes.\n\nFor example, on 16 December 1971, Ireland lodged a complaint against England with the ECMR for failing to comply with the prohibition of torture under Article 3 of the ECHR. Ireland could not file the complaint with either the CAT or the CCPR (Article 7 IpbpR), as they did not enter into force until about 10 years later.<ref>{{cite web|title=Europ\u00e4isches \u00dcbereinkommen zur friedlichen Beilegung von Streitigkeiten|periodical=[[Liechtensteinische Gesetzessammlung]]|url=https://www.gesetze.li/konso/1980061000|accessdate=2019-04-03}}</ref>\n\n===Note to this judgment of the ECtHR and the consequences (Guantanamo, Abu Graib)===\n\nIn its [[torture memos]] on the torture methods in [[Guantanamo]], etc.,<ref>{{cite web|title=Legal Brief on Proposed Counter-Resistance Strategies|periodical=Torture Memos|publisher=Hrsg: Departement of Defense der USA|url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/security/library/policy/dod/d20040622doc3.pdf|format=pdf|accessdate=2019-04-03|last=Diane E.

Art. 22 FoK is euphemistically referred to as communications (individual communications versus state-to-state complaints). If a state expressly agrees with the individual complaints procedure at the time of conclusion of the contract, the committee may also examine individual complaints against that contracting state (Art. 22 (1) FoK, Rule 102 VerfO).<ref>{{cite web|title=Model complaint form|publisher=Hrsg: [[UN-Hochkommissariat f\u00fcr Menschenrechte|UNHCHR]]|url=https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/ComplaintFormOPICCPR_CAT_CERD.doc|format=doc|accessdate=2019-04-03}}</ref>\n\nThe procedures of the appeal proceedings are listed in Chapter 21 of the VerfO, as well as the formal requirements for the individual complaints (Rule 104 RMA) and the condition for their admissibility (Rule 113 RPS). The UNHCHR created a complaint form (English: Model complaint form) and a related information sheet.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fact Sheet No. 17 Informationsblatt \u00fcber das Beschwerdeverfahren|publisher=Hrsg: [[UN-Hochkommissariat f\u00fcr Menschenrechte|UNHCHR]]|url=https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/FactSheet17en.pdf|format=pdf|accessdate=2019-04-03|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe complaint must be in writing, it must not be anonymous and must be written in one of the working languages of the committee; for this, the national legal process must be unsuccessful. Only then can a complaint be lodged with the committee, a period for appeal is not provided, but usually a complaint is not accepted after five years (ratione temporis). The complaint may be dismissed on the grounds that the committee has no jurisdiction, since the alleged infringement is not part of the FoK (ratione materiae) or it constitutes an abuse of the right of appeal. The same complaint may not be lodged with any other international body (e.g. the ECtHR, another UN treaty body or similar) (Article 22 (5) of the FoK, Rule 104, 113 of the Rules of Procedure).\n\nComplaints submitted to the UN are first formally reviewed by the Secretariat of UNHCHR. Then the complaint is either rejected or registered and forwarded to the committee (Rule 104. VerfO). There are no statistics on the number of complaints already rejected by the Secretariat.\n\nIf the complaint was rejected by the secretariat, the complainant will be notified in a standard letter. It uses the same form for rejecting the complaint filed with the CERD, CAT and the CCPR, in which mostly inadequate justification is ticked, although this is not provided for and instead information would have to be obtained (Rule 105 RCD). If the complaint has been received, the secretariat will prepare a summary - which may alienate the complaint - and forward it to the committee (Rule 106 RMA). The committee then examines the material admissibility of the complaint/summary (Article 22 (5) FoK, Rule 113, 116 VerO). If he declared the appeal inadmissible, then he - unlike the Secretariat - justified his decision of inadmissibility of the appeal. If it has been approved, the summary will be forwarded to the State concerned for comment, which may then raise the objection of inadmissibility (Rule 115 RCD). The committee also tries to reach an amicable agreement. If the State party so agrees, this will be decided in a decision (Discontinuance Decision) and the case is settled.\n\nOnly later does he deal with the complaint in terms of content (Rule 118 VerfO). If the committee has found a breach of contract, it gives the state proposals and recommendations on how to remedy them (Article 22 (7) FoK).<ref name=\"Follow-up_Reports_to_the_Complaints_Procedure\" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Follow-up to concluding observations|publisher=Hrsg: CAT|url=https://tbinternet.ohchr.org/_layouts/TreatyBodyExternal/FollowUp.aspx?Treaty=CAT&Lang=en|accessdate=2019-04-03|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe recommendations are not legally binding, their implementation can not be enforced, only a follow-up procedure is planned, in which the implementation of the recommendations is examined by the state and, where appropriate, it will be discussed in the next state reporting procedure. Sanctions are not provided against fallible states. Although in the preamble of FoK the torture ban acc. Art. 7 IPbpR was given as a basis and according to Art. 4 para. 2 IpBPR the prohibition of tort is mandatory international law - it has no consequences for the fallible state, the CAT is only recommended to stop it.\n\n===Precautionary measures===\nWhen lodging the complaint, interim measures may be required at the same time in the event of irreparable harm. Such requests must be submitted as soon as possible, with the reference Urgent Interim measures, so that the committee has sufficient time to consider the request and order such action. The Committee can also take precautionary measures on its own initiative, but they do not make a decision on the admissibility of the complaint or on the finding of a failure by the State (Rule 114 RCD).\n\n===Complaints to the CAT and the ECHR===\nA complaint, for example, for a violation of the prohibition of torture pursuant to Art. 7 IPbpR, Art. 1 FoK and Art. 3 ECHR may not be filed simultaneously with the committee, the ECtHR] or another UN treaty body, so-called \"same-subject reservation\" (Art. 22 para. 5 lit. a FoK). However, it is permissible for the committee to file a complaint for infringement of Art. 1 FoK Breach of the Torture Prohibition and to file a complaint with the ECtHR for breach of Art. 11 ECHR Freedom of assembly and association, as there is no overlap but concerns various breaches of contract by the same state .<ref>{{cite web|title=Application CAT/C/5/D/5/1990/Rev.1 by Walter Franz Leopold JEDINGER against Austria|url=https://tbinternet.ohchr.org/_layouts/treatybodyexternal/Download.aspx?symbolno=CAT/C/5/D/5/1990/Rev.1&Lang=en|accessdate=2019-04-03|last=CAT|quote=that the same matter has not been, examined under another procedure of international investigation or settlement. (...) the author has submitted the same matter to the ECHR, which has registered the case as application No. 16121/90}}</ref>\n\nThere are complaints that were first filed with, but not accepted by, the ECtHR, with the standard justification: the complaint has no appearance of violations of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention (ECHR) or its Additional Protocols. The complaint subsequently submitted to the UN Committee was then rejected on the ground that it had allegedly been examined by the ECtHR although the ECtHR did not substantively examine the complaint, but did not accept it.\n\nCorrespondingly, the decision no. 577/2013 [85] of the CAT Committee of 9 February 2016, i.S. N.B. c. Russia for torture. At the same time, the complainant had filed an identical complaint with the ECtHR (No. 33772/13), which was why the CAT committee rejected the complaint (see decision RZ 8.2). However, in the judgment database HUDOC of the ECHR there is no judgment with the no. 33772/13, as the complaint was refused by the Registry and removed from the register - thus not examined by the ECtHR.\n\nIn the meantime, there are decisions from the committee in which he nevertheless examined such complaints.\n\n==General remarks==\n\nThe Committee publishes general comments on the interpretation and specification of the various provisions of the Torture Convention. They are intended to clear up misunderstandings and to assist the contracting states in the fulfillment of their contractual obligations. To date, the committee has written four General Comments (GC).\n* GC No. 1 (1997): Implementation of Art. 3 FoK (Refoulement Prohibition) in connection with Art. 22 FoK Individual complaints\n* GC No. 2 Implementation of Art. 2 FoK Prevention of Torture\n* GC No. 3 (2012) Implementation of Art. 14 FoK Reparation\n* GC No. 4 (2017) Implementation of Art. 3 FoK (refoulement prohibition) in connection with Art. 22 FoK Individual complaints\n\n==Members of the CAT==\nThe members appointed under Art. 17 FoK for 4 years each\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

This examination procedure is regulated in Chapter 19 of the VerfO. The condition for this is that the state explicitly rejected this when ratifying the treaty (Article 28 (1) FoK).<ref>{{cite web|title=R\u00f6mer Statut des Internationalen Strafgerichtshofs|publisher=Hrsg: [[Liechtensteinische Gesetzessammlung]] (LILEX)|url=https://www.gesetze.li/konso/2002090000|accessdate=2019-04-03}}</ref>\n\nThe state is asked by the committee to participate in the investigation proceedings and to provide information on these suspicions (Article 20 (1) FoK, Rule 82 et seq. First of all, the information received is examined (Rule 81 et seq. Of the VerfO) and, if the suspicion has been substantiated, an investigation is carried out, in which case the Committee can also conduct investigations in the affected state if the state agrees. Upon completion of the investigation, the committee will send the investigation report to the State concerned and, if it finds any instances of [[maladministration]], appropriate recommendations on how to remedy them (Rule 89 RCD).\n\nTo date, 10 such studies have been performed. [18] These were: Egypt (2017), [[Lebanon]] (2014), [[Nepal]] (2012), [[Brazil]] (2008), [[Serbia and Montenegro]] (2004), [[Mexico]] (2003), [[Sri Lanka]] (2002), [[Peru]] (2001), [[Egypt]] (1996), [[Turkey]] (1994)\n\nThe recommendations of the committee are not legally binding, their implementation can not be enforced. Apart from the fact that he can carry out a follow-up procedure<ref name=\"Working_methods_Follow-up_to_concluding_observations\" /><ref name=\"Follow-up_to_concluding_observations_procedure\" /> to review the implementation of the recommendations or that the implementation of the recommendations will be discussed in the next state report, no further measures are foreseen (Article 20 (5) FoK, Rule 90).\n\nIf the committee is confronted with such serious or systematic torture by a state, it may also bring the matter to the attention of the UN General Assembly. The latter then decide on the further course of action, because extensive or systematic violations of the torture prohibition are considered crimes against humanity according to Art. 7 (1) of the Rome Statute  and the International Criminal Court in The Hague is responsible for this, provided that the fallible state does not [[International Criminal Court]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|periodical=[[Vertragssammlung der Vereinten Nationen|Vertragssammlung der UNO]]|url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XVIII-10&chapter=18&clang=_en|accessdate=2019-04-03|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==State cases==\nThis procedure is regulated in Chapter 20 of the VerfO. The Committee is empowered to consider cases of State where a Contracting State claims that another State Party is failing to fulfill its obligations under the Convention against Torture (Article 21 FoK). The condition for this is that both states explicitly recognized the competence of the committee when ratifying the treaty (Article 21 (1) FoK, Rule 91, 97 VerO).\n\nIn contrast to individual complaints, there are no high formal requirements for state complaints, and the UNHCHR Secretariat is not authorized to declare state complaints inadmissible, as in the case of individual complaints (Art. 22 (5) FoK Individual Complaints, Rule 111 ff.\n\nThe task of the committee is to settle the dispute (Article 21 (1) lit e FoK, Rule 98 of the Rules of Procedure). If no amicable agreement is reached, a final report will be prepared, completing the procedure for the committee (Article 21 (1) (h), (ii) FoK, Rule 101 of the VerfO). For international disputes, there are rules, u. a. the agreement for the peaceful settlement of international disputes <ref>{{cite web|title=Abkommen zur friedlichen Erledigung internationaler Streitf\u00e4lle|periodical=[[Liechtensteinische Gesetzessammlung]]|url=https://www.gesetze.li/konso/1995185000|accessdate=2019-04-03}}</ref> The states can then turn to the International Court of Justice<ref>{{cite web|title=Der Internationale Gerichtshof|periodical=[[Liechtensteinische Gesetzessammlung]]|url=https://www.gesetze.li/konso/1950006002|accessdate=2019-04-03}}</ref> within six months, provided that neither of the two states made a reservation in the ratification of the treaty (Article 30 FoK).\n\nAs a precautionary measure, 12 states rejected the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice when concluding the contract (Article 30 (1) FoK).\n\nStates do not necessarily have to refer to the International Court of Justice, there is also a European Convention on the Peaceful Settlement of Disputes.\n\nFor example, on 16 December 1971, Ireland lodged a complaint against England with the ECMR for failing to comply with the prohibition of torture under Article 3 of the ECHR. Ireland could not file the complaint with either the CAT or the CCPR (Article 7 IpbpR), as they did not enter into force until about 10 years later.<ref>{{cite web|title=Europ\u00e4isches \u00dcbereinkommen zur friedlichen Beilegung von Streitigkeiten|periodical=[[Liechtensteinische Gesetzessammlung]]|url=https://www.gesetze.li/konso/1980061000|accessdate=2019-04-03}}</ref>\n\n===Note to this judgment of the ECtHR and the consequences (Guantanamo, Abu Graib)===\n\nIn its [[torture memos]] on the torture methods in [[Guantanamo]], etc.,<ref>{{cite web|title=Legal Brief on Proposed Counter-Resistance Strategies|periodical=Torture Memos|publisher=Hrsg: Departement of Defense der USA|url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/security/library/policy/dod/d20040622doc3.pdf|format=pdf|accessdate=2019-04-03|last=Diane E.

Art. 22 FoK is euphemistically referred to as communications (individual communications versus state-to-state complaints). If a state expressly agrees with the individual complaints procedure at the time of conclusion of the contract, the committee may also examine individual complaints against that contracting state (Art. 22 (1) FoK, Rule 102 VerfO).<ref>{{cite web|title=Model complaint form|publisher=Hrsg: [[UN-Hochkommissariat f\u00fcr Menschenrechte|UNHCHR]]|url=https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/ComplaintFormOPICCPR_CAT_CERD.doc|format=doc|accessdate=2019-04-03}}</ref>\n\nThe procedures of the appeal proceedings are listed in Chapter 21 of the VerfO, as well as the formal requirements for the individual complaints (Rule 104 RMA) and the condition for their admissibility (Rule 113 RPS). The UNHCHR created a complaint form (English: Model complaint form) and a related information sheet.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fact Sheet No. 17 Informationsblatt \u00fcber das Beschwerdeverfahren|publisher=Hrsg: [[UN-Hochkommissariat f\u00fcr Menschenrechte|UNHCHR]]|url=https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/FactSheet17en.pdf|format=pdf|accessdate=2019-04-03|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe complaint must be in writing, it must not be anonymous and must be written in one of the working languages of the committee; for this, the national legal process must be unsuccessful. Only then can a complaint be lodged with the committee, a period for appeal is not provided, but usually a complaint is not accepted after five years (ratione temporis). The complaint may be dismissed on the grounds that the committee has no jurisdiction, since the alleged infringement is not part of the FoK (ratione materiae) or it constitutes an abuse of the right of appeal. The same complaint may not be lodged with any other international body (e.g. the ECtHR, another UN treaty body or similar) (Article 22 (5) of the FoK, Rule 104, 113 of the Rules of Procedure).\n\nComplaints submitted to the UN are first formally reviewed by the Secretariat of UNHCHR. Then the complaint is either rejected or registered and forwarded to the committee (Rule 104. VerfO). There are no statistics on the number of complaints already rejected by the Secretariat.\n\nIf the complaint was rejected by the secretariat, the complainant will be notified in a standard letter. It uses the same form for rejecting the complaint filed with the CERD, CAT and the CCPR, in which mostly inadequate justification is ticked, although this is not provided for and instead information would have to be obtained (Rule 105 RCD). If the complaint has been received, the secretariat will prepare a summary - which may alienate the complaint - and forward it to the committee (Rule 106 RMA). The committee then examines the material admissibility of the complaint/summary (Article 22 (5) FoK, Rule 113, 116 VerO). If he declared the appeal inadmissible, then he - unlike the Secretariat - justified his decision of inadmissibility of the appeal. If it has been approved, the summary will be forwarded to the State concerned for comment, which may then raise the objection of inadmissibility (Rule 115 RCD). The committee also tries to reach an amicable agreement. If the State party so agrees, this will be decided in a decision (Discontinuance Decision) and the case is settled.\n\nOnly later does he deal with the complaint in terms of content (Rule 118 VerfO). If the committee has found a breach of contract, it gives the state proposals and recommendations on how to remedy them (Article 22 (7) FoK).<ref name=\"Follow-up_Reports_to_the_Complaints_Procedure\" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Follow-up to concluding observations|publisher=Hrsg: CAT|url=https://tbinternet.ohchr.org/_layouts/TreatyBodyExternal/FollowUp.aspx?Treaty=CAT&Lang=en|accessdate=2019-04-03|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe recommendations are not legally binding, their implementation can not be enforced, only a follow-up procedure is planned, in which the implementation of the recommendations is examined by the state and, where appropriate, it will be discussed in the next state reporting procedure. Sanctions are not provided against fallible states. Although in the preamble of FoK the torture ban acc. Art. 7 IPbpR was given as a basis and according to Art. 4 para. 2 IpBPR the prohibition of tort is mandatory international law - it has no consequences for the fallible state, the CAT is only recommended to stop it.\n\n===Precautionary measures===\nWhen lodging the complaint, interim measures may be required at the same time in the event of irreparable harm. Such requests must be submitted as soon as possible, with the reference Urgent Interim measures, so that the committee has sufficient time to consider the request and order such action. The Committee can also take precautionary measures on its own initiative, but they do not make a decision on the admissibility of the complaint or on the finding of a failure by the State (Rule 114 RCD).\n\n===Complaints to the CAT and the ECHR===\nA complaint, for example, for a violation of the prohibition of torture pursuant to Art. 7 IPbpR, Art. 1 FoK and Art. 3 ECHR may not be filed simultaneously with the committee, the ECtHR] or another UN treaty body, so-called \"same-subject reservation\" (Art. 22 para. 5 lit. a FoK). However, it is permissible for the committee to file a complaint for infringement of Art. 1 FoK Breach of the Torture Prohibition and to file a complaint with the ECtHR for breach of Art. 11 ECHR Freedom of assembly and association, as there is no overlap but concerns various breaches of contract by the same state .<ref>{{cite web|title=Application CAT/C/5/D/5/1990/Rev.1 by Walter Franz Leopold JEDINGER against Austria|url=https://tbinternet.ohchr.org/_layouts/treatybodyexternal/Download.aspx?symbolno=CAT/C/5/D/5/1990/Rev.1&Lang=en|accessdate=2019-04-03|last=CAT|quote=that the same matter has not been, examined under another procedure of international investigation or settlement.

The complaint subsequently submitted to the UN Committee was then rejected on the ground that it had allegedly been examined by the ECtHR although the ECtHR did not substantively examine the complaint, but did not accept it.\n\nCorrespondingly, the decision no. 577/2013 [85] of the CAT Committee of 9 February 2016, i.S. N.B. c. Russia for torture. At the same time, the complainant had filed an identical complaint with the ECtHR (No. 33772/13), which was why the CAT committee rejected the complaint (see decision RZ 8.2). However, in the judgment database HUDOC of the ECHR there is no judgment with the no. 33772/13, as the complaint was refused by the Registry and removed from the register - thus not examined by the ECtHR.\n\nIn the meantime, there are decisions from the committee in which he nevertheless examined such complaints.\n\n==General remarks==\n\nThe Committee publishes general comments on the interpretation and specification of the various provisions of the Torture Convention. They are intended to clear up misunderstandings and to assist the contracting states in the fulfillment of their contractual obligations.

Nothing I can count on, and that makes it more dangerous.

In her early roles such as ''Manhattan'' and ''Kramer vs. Kramer'', she was compared to both [[Diane Keaton]] and [[Jill Clayburgh]], in that her characters were unsympathetic, which Streep has attributed to the tendency to be drawn to playing women who are difficult to like and lack empathy.{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=12}} Streep has stated that many consider her to be a technical actor, but she professed that it comes down to her love of reading the initial script, adding, \"I come ready and I don't want to screw around and waste the first 10 takes on adjusting lighting and everybody else getting comfortable\".{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=16}}\n\n[[File:Meryl Streep - Walk of Fame.jpg|thumb|Streep's star on the ''[[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]'']]\nMike Nichols, who directed Streep in ''Silkwood'', ''Heartburn'', ''Postcards from the Edge'', and ''Angels in America'', praised Streep's ability to transform herself into her characters, remarking that, \"In every role, she becomes a totally new human being.

She said in 1987, \"I have a smattering of things I've learned from different teachers, but nothing I can put into a valise and open it up and say, 'Now, which one would you like?' Nothing I can count on, and that makes it more dangerous.

In her early roles such as ''Manhattan'' and ''Kramer vs. Kramer'', she was compared to both [[Diane Keaton]] and [[Jill Clayburgh]], in that her characters were unsympathetic, which Streep has attributed to the tendency to be drawn to playing women who are difficult to like and lack empathy.{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=12}} Streep has stated that many consider her to be a technical actor, but she professed that it comes down to her love of reading the initial script, adding, \"I come ready and I don't want to screw around and waste the first 10 takes on adjusting lighting and everybody else getting comfortable\".{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=16}}\n\n[[File:Meryl Streep - Walk of Fame.jpg|thumb|Streep's star on the ''[[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]'']]\nMike Nichols, who directed Streep in ''Silkwood'', ''Heartburn'', ''Postcards from the Edge'', and ''Angels in America'', praised Streep's ability to transform herself into her characters, remarking that, \"In every role, she becomes a totally new human being.
