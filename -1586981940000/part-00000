Indoor tanning is already used by many people as a treatment for psoriasis; one indoor facility reported that 50% of its clients were using the center for psoriasis treatment; another reported 36% were doing the same thing. However, a concern with the use of commercial tanning is that tanning beds that primarily emit UVA might not effectively treat psoriasis.

Indoor tanning resources are almost ubiquitous today and could be considered as a means for people to get UV exposure when dermatologist provided phototherapy is not available. Indoor tanning is already used by many people as a treatment for psoriasis; one indoor facility reported that 50% of its clients were using the center for psoriasis treatment; another reported 36% were doing the same thing. However, a concern with the use of commercial tanning is that tanning beds that primarily emit UVA might not effectively treat psoriasis. One study found that plaque psoriasis is responsive to [[erythema|erythemogenic]] doses of either UVA or UVB, as exposure to either can cause dissipation of psoriatic plaques. It does require more energy to reach erythemogenic dosing with UVA.<ref name=\"radack\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Radack KP, Farhangian ME, Anderson KL, Feldman SR | title = A review of the use of tanning beds as a dermatological treatment | journal = Dermatology and Therapy | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 37\u201351 | date = March 2015 | pmid = 25735439 | pmc = 4374067 | doi = 10.1007/s13555-015-0071-8 }}</ref>\n\n<!-- Risks of UV light therapy -->\nUV light therapies all have risks; tanning beds are no exception, being listed by the [[World Health Organization]] as carcinogens.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors=((World Health Organization)) | title=Artificial tanning devices: public health interventions to manage sunbeds | publisher=[[World Health Organization]] (WHO) | date=15 June 2017 | hdl=10665/255695 | isbn=9789241512596 }}</ref> Exposure to UV light is known to increase the risks of melanoma, squamous cell and basal cell carcinomas; younger people with psoriasis, particularly those under age 35, are at increased risk from melanoma from UV light treatment.

The [[mechanism of action]] of PUVA is unknown, but probably involves activation of psoralen by UVA light, which inhibits the abnormally rapid production of the cells in psoriatic skin.  There are multiple mechanisms of action associated with PUVA, including effects on the skin's immune system.

Retrieved on 2013-06-08.</ref> The Psoriasis International Network, a program of the Fondation Ren\u00e9 Touraine, gathers dermatologists, [[rheumatologist]]s and other caregivers involved in the management of psoriasis.\nNon-profit organizations the [[National Psoriasis Foundation]] in the United States, the Psoriasis Association in the United Kingdom and Psoriasis Australia offer advocacy and education about psoriasis in their respective countries.\n\n===Cost===\nThe annual cost for treating psoriasis in the United States is estimated as high as $32.5{{nbsp}}billion, including $12.2{{nbsp}}billion in direct costs. Pharmacy costs are the main source of direct expense, with biologic therapy the most prevalent. These costs increase significantly when co-morbid conditions such as heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, lung disease and psychiatric disorders are factored in. Expenses linked to co-morbidities are estimated at an additional $23,000 per person per year.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Evans C | title = Managed care aspects of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis | journal = The American Journal of Managed Care | volume = 22 | issue = 8 Suppl | pages = s238-43 | date = June 2016 | pmid = 27356195 | url = http://www.ajmc.com/journals/supplement/2016/Easing_the_Economic_Clinical_Burden_Psoriasis_Psoriatic_Arthritis_The_Role_Managed_Care/Managed-Care-Aspects-of-Psoriasis-and-Psoriatic-Arthritis/ | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170202134534/http://www.ajmc.com/journals/supplement/2016/Easing_the_Economic_Clinical_Burden_Psoriasis_Psoriatic_Arthritis_The_Role_Managed_Care/Managed-Care-Aspects-of-Psoriasis-and-Psoriatic-Arthritis/ | archive-date = 2017-02-02 }}</ref>\n\n==Research==\nThe role of [[insulin resistance]] in the pathogenesis of psoriasis is under investigation.
