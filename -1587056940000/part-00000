Based on the concept of [[Time travel in fiction|time travel]], the film stars actor [[Suriya]] in a [[dual role|triple role]], along with [[Samantha Ruth Prabhu]] and [[Nithya Menen]] as the female lead.\n\nThe film's development dates back to 2009, at which time it was to feature actors [[Vikram (actor)|Vikram]] and [[Ileana D'Cruz]] in lead roles. However, in February 2010, the project was dropped due to difference in opinions between director, producer and actor, facing rejection of the refined script. In August 2014, Suriya agreed to produce and act in the film, with [[principal photography]] commencing in [[Mumbai]] in April 2015, continuing in [[Nasik]], [[Goregaon]] and [[Pune]]. The second phase of filming was done in [[Poland]] by the end of September 2015. Filming was completed in [[Chennai]] by November 2015.\n \nProduced by [[2D Entertainment]], the film has [[cinematography]] by [[Tirru|S. Tirru]]. The soundtrack and film score were composed by [[A.

The film (along with a dubbed [[Telugu language|Telugu]] version with the same title) was released on 6 May 2016.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/regional/suriyas-24-to-release-on-may-6-2756020/ | title=Suriya\u2019s 24 to release on May 6 | work=The Indian Express | date=16 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe film won two awards at the [[64th National Film Awards]] {{ndash}} [[National Film Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] and [[National Film Award for Best Production Design|Best Production Design]].

In January 1990, on his birthday, he invents a watch with which a person can travel back and forth in time for a maximum of 24 hours. His evil twin brother Athreya (Suriya) tries to take the watch and kills Priya in the process. Sethuraman escapes with Mani and boards a train. Before Athreya arrives, he hands Mani to a passenger named Sathyabama ([[Saranya Ponvannan]]) and pleads with her to save his son. Athreya kills Sethuraman and is seriously injured in an attempt to escape. Sathyabama's father ([[Girish Karnad]]) is against her decision to save Mani, and she leaves with him for [[Chennai]] to honour the promise given to Sethuraman.\n\n26 years later, Mani (Suriya) becomes a [[watchmaker]] who considers Sathyabama as his biological mother. A [[paralysis|paralyzed]] Athreya wakes up from his coma and decides to find the watch; he hopes to go back to 1990 and save himself from the accident. In a series of incidents, Mani finds Sethuraman's watch and explores its powers. Using them, he manages to impress Sathya ([[Samantha Ruth Prabhu]]), his client who hails from Sathyabama's native place, [[Gopalasamudram]]. Athreya's close aide Mithran ([[Ajay (actor)|Ajay]]) issues an advertisement offering five crore rupees (50 million rupees) to the one who finds Sethuraman's watch. Including Mani, many prepare duplicates of the watch and submit them, but Athreya spots Mani's accurate design, severs his arm, and kills him, thereby gaining possession of the watch.\n\nAthreya is shocked to learn that the watch can only help him travel back and forth for 24 hours and decides to revive Mani. Mithran places the watch on Mani's right hand and leaves. Mani wakes up the next morning and is shocked as he had been wearing the watch on his right hand. He travels back to  the previous night and secretly follows Mithran. Athreya predicts this and manages to fool Mani with Mithran's help, pretending that he is Sethuraman, who survived from Athreya as a [[paraplegic]]. Mani learns from Sathyabama that Sethuraman left him in the train and faced Athreya in another compartment.\n\nMani leaves with Sathyabama for Gopalasamudram and unites her with her estranged family. He also comes to know that Sathya is Sathyabama's niece, and the duo fall in love. Athreya arrives with Mithran and convinces everyone, including Mani, that he is Sethuraman and that Athreya is dead. Sathya learns about Athreya's identity later and tries to reveal it to Mani, but Athreya manages to fall from a staircase, and Mani, unaware of the reality, travels back in time and saves him. Sathya forgets about Athreya's identity and assumes that he is Sethuraman.\n\nMani learns from Mithran that his father is going to die soon and wishes to see Priya for one last time by traveling back in time to 1990. Mani modifies the watch and tests it, which reveals the truth about Athreya's identity. He tricks Athreya into revealing the date and time of Priya's death and gives him a fake watch. Mani uses the original watch to travel back in time to 1990 and Athreya accompanies him by touching the real watch in use.\n\nIn January 1990, Sethuraman and Priya spot the modified watch on their baby's hand. Initially joyous, Sethuraman senses danger; he feels that Mani returned to a toddler's age as they may not be alive when he was able to speak. Athreya, now young and healthy, attacks Sethuraman to find the watch. Sethuraman and Priya escape with Mani, and Athreya accidentally kills Mithran. Priya and Mani hide in a room as Athreya faces Sethuraman in the garden. Sethuraman freezes time and lays Athreya before a bullet, thus killing him. He then flees with Priya and Mani and boards the same train, but not before throwing away the watch on Priya's urging. They meet Sathyabama, and Sethuraman agrees to teach [[science]] to children in a school constructed by her father in Gopalasamudram. The film ends with young Mani speaking with Sathya.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Suriya]] in a triple role as\n**Dr. Sethuraman, a scientist who invented a time-travelling 24 watch\n**Athreya, Sethuraman's twin who wants to get hold of watch and Mani's paternal uncle\n**Manikandan ''\"Mani\"'' Sethuraman aka Subramani, Sethuraman's son and Athreya's nephew\n* [[Nithya Menen]] as Priya Sethuraman, Sethuraman's wife and Mani's biological mother\n* [[Samantha Ruth Prabhu]] as Sathyabhama aka Sathya (Sandhyabharathi aka Sandhya in the Hindi dubbed version), Mani's love interest\n* [[Saranya Ponvannan]] as Sathyabhama, Mani's adoptive mother\n* [[Ajay (actor)|Ajay]] as Mithran (Viraj in Hindi dubbed version), Athreya's sidekick \n* [[Girish Karnad]] as Sathya's grandfather\n* [[Mohan Raman]] as Sathya's father\n* [[Sudha (Telugu actress)|Sudha]] as Sathya's mother\n* [[Sathyan (Tamil actor)|Sathyan]] as Saravanan, Mani's friend\n* [[Charle]] as Reddiyar\n* [[Kajal]]\n* [[Appukutty]] as Reddiyar's staff\n* [[Harsha Vardhan]] as Kalai, an electrician who works for Athreya\n* Natarajan Balkrishna as Sathya's uncle\n* T.

Based on the concept of [[Time travel in fiction|time travel]], the film stars actor [[Suriya]] in a [[dual role|triple role]], along with [[Samantha Ruth Prabhu]] and [[Nithya Menen]] as the female lead.\n\nThe film's development dates back to 2009, at which time it was to feature actors [[Vikram (actor)|Vikram]] and [[Ileana D'Cruz]] in lead roles. However, in February 2010, the project was dropped due to difference in opinions between director, producer and actor, facing rejection of the refined script. In August 2014, Suriya agreed to produce and act in the film, with [[principal photography]] commencing in [[Mumbai]] in April 2015, continuing in [[Nasik]], [[Goregaon]] and [[Pune]]. The second phase of filming was done in [[Poland]] by the end of September 2015. Filming was completed in [[Chennai]] by November 2015.\n \nProduced by [[2D Entertainment]], the film has [[cinematography]] by [[Tirru|S. Tirru]]. The soundtrack and film score were composed by [[A.

In January 1990, on his birthday, he invents a watch with which a person can travel back and forth in time for a maximum of 24 hours. His evil twin brother Athreya (Suriya) tries to take the watch and kills Priya in the process. Sethuraman escapes with Mani and boards a train. Before Athreya arrives, he hands Mani to a passenger named Sathyabama ([[Saranya Ponvannan]]) and pleads with her to save his son. Athreya kills Sethuraman and is seriously injured in an attempt to escape. Sathyabama's father ([[Girish Karnad]]) is against her decision to save Mani, and she leaves with him for [[Chennai]] to honour the promise given to Sethuraman.\n\n26 years later, Mani (Suriya) becomes a [[watchmaker]] who considers Sathyabama as his biological mother. A [[paralysis|paralyzed]] Athreya wakes up from his coma and decides to find the watch; he hopes to go back to 1990 and save himself from the accident. In a series of incidents, Mani finds Sethuraman's watch and explores its powers. Using them, he manages to impress Sathya ([[Samantha Ruth Prabhu]]), his client who hails from Sathyabama's native place, [[Gopalasamudram]]. Athreya's close aide Mithran ([[Ajay (actor)|Ajay]]) issues an advertisement offering five crore rupees (50 million rupees) to the one who finds Sethuraman's watch. Including Mani, many prepare duplicates of the watch and submit them, but Athreya spots Mani's accurate design, severs his arm, and kills him, thereby gaining possession of the watch.\n\nAthreya is shocked to learn that the watch can only help him travel back and forth for 24 hours and decides to revive Mani. Mithran places the watch on Mani's right hand and leaves. Mani wakes up the next morning and is shocked as he had been wearing the watch on his right hand. He travels back to  the previous night and secretly follows Mithran. Athreya predicts this and manages to fool Mani with Mithran's help, pretending that he is Sethuraman, who survived from Athreya as a [[paraplegic]]. Mani learns from Sathyabama that Sethuraman left him in the train and faced Athreya in another compartment.\n\nMani leaves with Sathyabama for Gopalasamudram and unites her with her estranged family. He also comes to know that Sathya is Sathyabama's niece, and the duo fall in love. Athreya arrives with Mithran and convinces everyone, including Mani, that he is Sethuraman and that Athreya is dead. Sathya learns about Athreya's identity later and tries to reveal it to Mani, but Athreya manages to fall from a staircase, and Mani, unaware of the reality, travels back in time and saves him. Sathya forgets about Athreya's identity and assumes that he is Sethuraman.\n\nMani learns from Mithran that his father is going to die soon and wishes to see Priya for one last time by traveling back in time to 1990. Mani modifies the watch and tests it, which reveals the truth about Athreya's identity. He tricks Athreya into revealing the date and time of Priya's death and gives him a fake watch. Mani uses the original watch to travel back in time to 1990 and Athreya accompanies him by touching the real watch in use.\n\nIn January 1990, Sethuraman and Priya spot the modified watch on their baby's hand. Initially joyous, Sethuraman senses danger; he feels that Mani returned to a toddler's age as they may not be alive when he was able to speak. Athreya, now young and healthy, attacks Sethuraman to find the watch. Sethuraman and Priya escape with Mani, and Athreya accidentally kills Mithran.

Coverage is also shown on ESPN's sister network, [[ESPN on ABC|ABC]]. The inaugural X Games were held during the summer of 1995 in [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]] and [[Newport, Rhode Island]].  Participants compete to win bronze, silver, and gold medals, as well as prize money.\n\nThe competition often features new tricks such as [[Tony Hawk]]'s [[900 (skateboarding trick)|900]] in [[skateboarding]], [[Travis Pastrana]]'s double backflip in [[freestyle motocross]], Heath Frisby's first snowmobile front flip in Snowmobile Best Trick, [[Henrick Harlaut]]\u2019s first ever nose-butter triple cork in Ski Big Air,  [[Gus Kenworthy]]\u2019s first switch triple rodeo in a [[ski]] [[slopestyle]] competition and [[Torstein Horgmo]]'s first landed triple cork in a [[snowboard]] competition. Concurrent with competition is the \"X Fest\" sports and music festival, which offers live music, athlete autograph sessions, and interactive elements.\n\nThe X Games gained media exposure due to their big name sponsors, top-tier athletes, and consistent fan attendance. As the ''Journal of Sport Management'' (2006) explains, [[Generation X]] and [[Generation Y]] are the two demographics most highly valued by marketers. This creates a broad approach on marketing towards that certain demographic, which is why the X Games marketing and economic outlook is so \"out of the box\". According to a 2008 report by ESPN, in 1997, the '''Winter X Games''' inaugural year, 38,000 spectators attended the four-day event. In 1998, the attendance dropped to 25,000 spectators. But just two years later, a record attendance of 83,500 people attended the Winter X Games' East Coast debut. The X Games and Winter X Games continue to grow with the popularity of action sports and the athletes who compete in them.\n\nAs part of the X Games, there have been performances by various rock bands over the years, as well as a DJ being on-site at all events.  The X Games have made it a point since its founding to stage an eco-friendly event. Such measures include using [[biodiesel]] fuel in their vehicles and organizing recycling campaigns.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Coryell|first1=Grace|title=ESPN's working hard to keep the Winter X Games green|url=http://www.espnfrontrow.com/2012/01/espns-working-hard-to-keep-the-winter-x-games-green/|website=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=February 9, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe X Games has never carried out [[drug test]]s on competitors, a position which has been criticized by the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] director general David Howman and the [[International Olympic Committee]] [[President of the International Olympic Committee|president]] [[Thomas Bach]].<ref>[https://www.wada-ama.org/en/media/news/2016-02/wada-statement-on-x-games-in-norway WADA Statement on X Games in Norway] \u2013 World Anti-Doping Agency, February 22, 2016</ref><ref>[http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Daily/Issues/2016/02/22/Events-and-Attractions/X-Games.aspx ESPN pushing ahead with X Games Oslo despite criticism of drug-testing policy] \u2013 Ben Fischer, Sports Business Daily, February 22, 2016</ref><ref>[http://aroundtherings.com/site/A__54874/Title__Bach-Blasts-X-Games-Oslo-for-No-Drug-Testing/292/Articles Bach Blasts X Games Oslo for No Drug Testing] \u2013 Around the Ring, February 21, 2016</ref>\n\n==Winter X Games==\n[[File:Winter X Games logo.svg|thumb|upright|Variation of X Games logo, used for Winter X Games]]\n\nThe Winter X Games VIII in 2002 was the first time an X Games event was televised live and also had coverage by ESPN's flagship news program, ''[[SportsCenter]]''. Viewership across the three networks that carried coverage of the event&nbsp;\u2013 ABC Sports, ESPN, and [[ESPN2]]&nbsp;\u2013 exceeded 2001's household average by 30% according to Nielsen Media Research. The event also reached record highs in several demographic categories. To accommodate the first-time live coverage, nighttime competitions were added, resulting in record attendance for the [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]]/[[Snowmass, Colorado|Snowmass]] venue in Colorado.\n\nThe 2002 Winter X Games was a humongous year for ESPN and the X Games. It was the first year that the games were held in Aspen at Buttermilk Mountain. The Games continued to add new events including the ski slopestyle event, ski superpipe event, snowboarding, skateboarding etc. The most memorable incident of the 2002 Games was when the entire 2002 U.S. Olympic freestyle snowboarding team showed up to compete in the Winter X snowboard superpipe event, just weeks before the [[2002 Winter Olympics|Winter Olympics]] in Salt Lake City. Also in 2002, ESPN announced the establishment of the X Games Global Championship. The Global Championship featured two distinct venues hosting competitions in summer and winter action sports simultaneously. It consisted of six teams of the world's top athletes, grouped together by their region of origin, to compete in the four-day event. The winter sports were held in Whistler Blackcomb Resort in British Columbia, and the events included snowboarding and skiing.\n\nThe Winter X Games are held in January or February (usually in January) and the Summer X Games are usually held in August, both in the United States. The location of the Winter X Games is in Aspen, Colorado, through 2019, while the location for the Summer X Games has been in Los Angeles, changing to [[Austin, Texas]], in June 2014. The X Games also has international competitions and demos around the world that are held at varying times throughout the year. The games are shown live on television.\n\nThe Winter X Games are, as described by ESPN (2008), a competition compiled of the greatest winter action sport athletes from around the world competing on an annual basis. The competition has day and evening events including skiing, snowboarding and snowmobiling. The first Winter X Games took place at Snow Summit ski resort in [[Big Bear Lake, California]], in 1997. The following two years, the Games were held at [[Crested Butte Mountain Resort]] in Colorado. The two years following that, the Games were held in [[Mount Snow, Vermont]].

annual [[extreme sport]]s event hosted, produced, and broadcast by [[ESPN]]. Coverage is also shown on ESPN's sister network, [[ESPN on ABC|ABC]]. The inaugural X Games were held during the summer of 1995 in [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]] and [[Newport, Rhode Island]].  Participants compete to win bronze, silver, and gold medals, as well as prize money.\n\nThe competition often features new tricks such as [[Tony Hawk]]'s [[900 (skateboarding trick)|900]] in [[skateboarding]], [[Travis Pastrana]]'s double backflip in [[freestyle motocross]], Heath Frisby's first snowmobile front flip in Snowmobile Best Trick, [[Henrick Harlaut]]\u2019s first ever nose-butter triple cork in Ski Big Air,  [[Gus Kenworthy]]\u2019s first switch triple rodeo in a [[ski]] [[slopestyle]] competition and [[Torstein Horgmo]]'s first landed triple cork in a [[snowboard]] competition. Concurrent with competition is the \"X Fest\" sports and music festival, which offers live music, athlete autograph sessions, and interactive elements.\n\nThe X Games gained media exposure due to their big name sponsors, top-tier athletes, and consistent fan attendance. As the ''Journal of Sport Management'' (2006) explains, [[Generation X]] and [[Generation Y]] are the two demographics most highly valued by marketers. This creates a broad approach on marketing towards that certain demographic, which is why the X Games marketing and economic outlook is so \"out of the box\". According to a 2008 report by ESPN, in 1997, the '''Winter X Games''' inaugural year, 38,000 spectators attended the four-day event. In 1998, the attendance dropped to 25,000 spectators. But just two years later, a record attendance of 83,500 people attended the Winter X Games' East Coast debut. The X Games and Winter X Games continue to grow with the popularity of action sports and the athletes who compete in them.\n\nAs part of the X Games, there have been performances by various rock bands over the years, as well as a DJ being on-site at all events.  The X Games have made it a point since its founding to stage an eco-friendly event. Such measures include using [[biodiesel]] fuel in their vehicles and organizing recycling campaigns.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Coryell|first1=Grace|title=ESPN's working hard to keep the Winter X Games green|url=http://www.espnfrontrow.com/2012/01/espns-working-hard-to-keep-the-winter-x-games-green/|website=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=February 9, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe X Games has never carried out [[drug test]]s on competitors, a position which has been criticized by the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] director general David Howman and the [[International Olympic Committee]] [[President of the International Olympic Committee|president]] [[Thomas Bach]].<ref>[https://www.wada-ama.org/en/media/news/2016-02/wada-statement-on-x-games-in-norway WADA Statement on X Games in Norway] \u2013 World Anti-Doping Agency, February 22, 2016</ref><ref>[http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Daily/Issues/2016/02/22/Events-and-Attractions/X-Games.aspx ESPN pushing ahead with X Games Oslo despite criticism of drug-testing policy] \u2013 Ben Fischer, Sports Business Daily, February 22, 2016</ref><ref>[http://aroundtherings.com/site/A__54874/Title__Bach-Blasts-X-Games-Oslo-for-No-Drug-Testing/292/Articles Bach Blasts X Games Oslo for No Drug Testing] \u2013 Around the Ring, February 21, 2016</ref>\n\n==Winter X Games==\n[[File:Winter X Games logo.svg|thumb|upright|Variation of X Games logo, used for Winter X Games]]\n\nThe Winter X Games VIII in 2002 was the first time an X Games event was televised live and also had coverage by ESPN's flagship news program, ''[[SportsCenter]]''. Viewership across the three networks that carried coverage of the event&nbsp;\u2013 ABC Sports, ESPN, and [[ESPN2]]&nbsp;\u2013 exceeded 2001's household average by 30% according to Nielsen Media Research. The event also reached record highs in several demographic categories. To accommodate the first-time live coverage, nighttime competitions were added, resulting in record attendance for the [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]]/[[Snowmass, Colorado|Snowmass]] venue in Colorado.\n\nThe 2002 Winter X Games was a humongous year for ESPN and the X Games. It was the first year that the games were held in Aspen at Buttermilk Mountain. The Games continued to add new events including the ski slopestyle event, ski superpipe event, snowboarding, skateboarding etc. The most memorable incident of the 2002 Games was when the entire 2002 U.S. Olympic freestyle snowboarding team showed up to compete in the Winter X snowboard superpipe event, just weeks before the [[2002 Winter Olympics|Winter Olympics]] in Salt Lake City. Also in 2002, ESPN announced the establishment of the X Games Global Championship. The Global Championship featured two distinct venues hosting competitions in summer and winter action sports simultaneously. It consisted of six teams of the world's top athletes, grouped together by their region of origin, to compete in the four-day event. The winter sports were held in Whistler Blackcomb Resort in British Columbia, and the events included snowboarding and skiing.\n\nThe Winter X Games are held in January or February (usually in January) and the Summer X Games are usually held in August, both in the United States. The location of the Winter X Games is in Aspen, Colorado, through 2019, while the location for the Summer X Games has been in Los Angeles, changing to [[Austin, Texas]], in June 2014. The X Games also has international competitions and demos around the world that are held at varying times throughout the year. The games are shown live on television.\n\nThe Winter X Games are, as described by ESPN (2008), a competition compiled of the greatest winter action sport athletes from around the world competing on an annual basis. The competition has day and evening events including skiing, snowboarding and snowmobiling. The first Winter X Games took place at Snow Summit ski resort in [[Big Bear Lake, California]], in 1997. The following two years, the Games were held at [[Crested Butte Mountain Resort]] in Colorado. The two years following that, the Games were held in [[Mount Snow, Vermont]]. Since 2002, the Winter X Games have been held at Aspen's [[Buttermilk (ski area)|Buttermilk Mountain]] and will continue to be until 2024, according to ESPN.\n\nDuring 2015's Winter X Games, ESPN used camera drones to capture aerial views of the athlete's runs. This was a first for ESPN.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2015/01/21/espn-is-bringing-camera-drones-to-the-x-games/|title=ESPN is bringing camera drones to the X Games|author=Edgar Alvarez|publisher=AOL|work=Engadget|accessdate=August 6, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Global expansion==\n[[X Games Asia]] have been held annually since 1998.\n\nIn May 2003, the X Games held the Global Championships, a special event where five continents competed in 11 disciplines.

It was named for the [[Winnebago (tribe)|Winnebago Tribe]] of [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]].  At the time the county was founded its inhabitants consisted almost entirely of New Englanders and New England transplants from upstate New York.<ref>History of Rockford and Winnebago County, Illinois: From the First Settlement in 1834 to the Civil War pg. 253</ref>  These were \"Yankee\" settlers, meaning they were descended from the English Puritans who settled New England during the early 1600s.  They made up virtually all of Winnebago County's inhabitants during the first several decades of its history.  In this regard the county was similar to most of the northern portion of the state of Illinois, and almost all of the neighboring state of Wisconsin.  After the conclusion of the [[Black Hawk War]] there was an additional surge of immigration from [[New England]].  As a result of this heritage the inhabitants of Winnebago County considered themselves, and functioned as, a cultural expansion of early New England culture.<ref>The Expansion of New England: The Spread of New England Settlement and Institutions to the Mississippi River, 1620-1865 by Lois imball Mathews pg. 210-212</ref>  In the Presidential election of 1860, [[Abraham Lincoln]] won 3,985 votes in Winnebago County, whereas [[Stephen A.

It was named for the [[Winnebago (tribe)|Winnebago Tribe]] of [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]].  At the time the county was founded its inhabitants consisted almost entirely of New Englanders and New England transplants from upstate New York.<ref>History of Rockford and Winnebago County, Illinois: From the First Settlement in 1834 to the Civil War pg. 253</ref>  These were \"Yankee\" settlers, meaning they were descended from the English Puritans who settled New England during the early 1600s.  They made up virtually all of Winnebago County's inhabitants during the first several decades of its history.  In this regard the county was similar to most of the northern portion of the state of Illinois, and almost all of the neighboring state of Wisconsin.  After the conclusion of the [[Black Hawk War]] there was an additional surge of immigration from [[New England]].  As a result of this heritage the inhabitants of Winnebago County considered themselves, and functioned as, a cultural expansion of early New England culture.<ref>The Expansion of New England: The Spread of New England Settlement and Institutions to the Mississippi River, 1620-1865 by Lois imball Mathews pg. 210-212</ref>  In the Presidential election of 1860, [[Abraham Lincoln]] won 3,985 votes in Winnebago County, whereas [[Stephen A.
