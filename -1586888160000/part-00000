As many as eighty families arrived from Long Island, Rhode Island and Massachusetts during the first years. Quaker meetings were established by 1670.

The remaining twelve overseas territories cover an area 5,997&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.\n\nOther countries with very similar land areas to the United Kingdom include [[Guinea]] (slightly larger), [[Uganda]], [[Ghana]] and [[Romania]] (all slightly smaller). The UK is the world's 80th largest country by land area and the 10th largest in Europe (if European Russia is included).\n\n==Physical geography==\n[[File:uk topo en.jpg|thumb|UK's topography]]\n<!-- Missing image removed: [[File:Geological map of Great Britain.jpg|thumb|right|As this [[geology|geological]] map of [[Great Britain]] demonstrates, the [[geology]] of the [[United Kingdom|UK]] is varied and complex.]] -->\nThe [[physical geography]] of the UK varies greatly. [[Geography of England|England]] consists of mostly lowland terrain, with upland or mountainous terrain only found north-west of the [[Tees-Exe line]]. The upland areas include the [[Lake District]], the [[Pennines]], [[North York Moors]], [[Exmoor]] and [[Dartmoor]]. The lowland areas are typically traversed by ranges of low hills, frequently composed of [[chalk]], and flat plains. [[Geography of Scotland|Scotland]] is the most mountainous country in the UK and its physical geography is distinguished by the [[Highland Boundary Fault]] which traverses the Scottish mainland from [[Helensburgh]] to [[Stonehaven]]. The faultline separates the two distinctively different regions of the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]] to the north and west, and the [[Scottish Lowlands|Lowlands]] to the south and east. The Highlands are predominantly mountainous, containing the majority of Scotland's mountainous landscape, while the Lowlands contain flatter land, especially across the [[Central Lowlands]], with upland and mountainous terrain located at the [[Southern Uplands]]. [[Geography of Wales|Wales]] is mostly mountainous, though [[south Wales]] is less mountainous than [[North Wales|north]] and [[mid Wales]]. [[Geography of Ireland|Northern Ireland]] consists of mostly hilly landscape and its geography includes the [[Mourne Mountains]] as well as [[Lough Neagh]], at {{convert|388|km2|sqmi|0}}, the largest body of water in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/ni/geog.htm|title=Geography of Northern Ireland|publisher=University of Ulster|accessdate=25 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe overall [[geomorphology]] of the UK was shaped by a combination of forces including [[tectonics]] and [[Climate change (general concept)|climate change]], in particular [[glaciation]] in northern and western areas.\n\nThe tallest mountain in the UK (and British Isles) is [[Ben Nevis]], in the [[Grampian Mountains]], Scotland. The longest river is the [[River Severn]] which flows from [[Wales]] into England. The largest lake by surface area is [[Lough Neagh]] in Northern Ireland, though Scotland's [[Loch Ness]] has the largest volume.\n\n=== Physical Geography ===\n{{See also|Geology of Great Britain|Geology of Ireland}}\n\nThe geology of the UK is complex and diverse, a result of it being subject to a variety of [[plate tectonic]] processes over a very extended period of time. Changing latitude and sea levels have been important factors in the nature of sedimentary sequences, whilst successive continental collisions have affected its [[Geological structure of Great Britain|geological structure]] with major faulting and folding being a legacy of each [[orogeny]] (mountain-building period), often associated with [[volcanism|volcanic]] activity and the metamorphism of existing rock sequences. As a result of this eventful geological history, the UK shows a rich variety of [[landscape]]s.<ref name=Toghill>{{cite book |title=The Geology of Britain: An Introduction |last=Toghill |first=Peter |authorlink= |author2= |year=2000 |publisher=Swan Hill Press |location= Shrewsbury|isbn=1-85310-890-1 }}</ref>\n\n====Precambrian====\nThe oldest rocks in the British Isles are the [[Lewisian gneiss]]es, metamorphic rocks found in the far north west of Scotland and in the [[Hebrides]] (with a few small outcrops elsewhere), which date from at least 2,700 Ma (Ma = million years ago). South and east of the gneisses are a complex mixture of rocks forming the North West [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]] and [[Grampian]] Highlands in Scotland. These are essentially the remains of folded [[sedimentary rock]]s that were deposited between 1,000 Ma and 670 Ma over the gneiss on what was then the floor of the [[Iapetus Ocean]].\n\n====Palaeozoic====\nAt 520 Ma, what is now Great Britain was split between two [[continent]]s; the north of Scotland was located on the continent of [[Laurentia]] at about 20\u00b0 south of the [[equator]], while the rest of the country was on the continent of [[Gondwana]] near the [[Antarctic Circle]]. In Gondwana, England and [[Wales]] were largely submerged under a shallow sea studded with [[volcano|volcanic]] islands. The remains of these islands underlie much of central England with small outcrops visible in many places.\n\nAbout 500 Ma southern Britain, the east coast of [[North America]] and south-east [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] broke away from Gondwana to form the continent of [[Avalonia]], which by 440 Ma had drifted to about 30\u00b0 south. During this period north Wales was subject to [[volcanism|volcanic]] activity. The remains of these volcanoes are still visible, one example of which is [[Rhobell Fawr]] dating from 510 Ma. Large quantities of volcanic [[lava]] and ash known as the [[Borrowdale Volcanics]] covered the [[Lake District]] and this can still be seen in the form of mountains such as [[Helvellyn]] and [[Scafell Pike]].\n\nBetween 425 and 400 Ma [[Avalonia]] had joined with the continent of [[Baltica]], and the combined landmass collided with [[Laurentia]] at about 20\u00b0 south, joining the southern and northern halves of [[Great Britain]] together. The resulting [[Caledonian Orogeny]] produced an [[Alps|Alpine]]-style mountain range in much of north and west Britain.\n\nThe collision between continents continued during the [[Devonian period]], producing uplift and subsequent erosion, resulting in the deposition of numerous sedimentary rock layers in lowlands and seas. The [[Old Red Sandstone]] and the contemporary volcanics and marine sediments found in [[Devon]] originated from these processes.\n\nAround 360 Ma Great Britain was lying at the equator, covered by the warm shallow waters of the [[Rheic Ocean]], during which time the Carboniferous Limestone was deposited, as found in the [[Mendip Hills]] and the [[Peak District]] of [[Derbyshire]]. Later, [[river delta]]s formed and the sediments deposited were colonised by [[swamp]]s and [[rain forest]]. It was in this environment that the [[Coal Measures]] were formed, the source of the majority of Britain's extensive [[coal]] reserves.\n\nAround 280 Ma the [[Variscan orogeny]] mountain-building period occurred, again due to collision of continental plates, causing major deformation in south west England. The general region of Variscan folding was south of an east\u2013west line roughly from south [[Pembrokeshire]] to [[Kent]]. Towards the end of this period [[granite]] was formed beneath the overlying rocks of [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]], now exposed at [[Dartmoor]] and [[Bodmin Moor]].\n\nBy the end of the Carboniferous period the various continents of the Earth had fused to form the super-continent of [[Pangaea]]. [[Great Britain|Britain]] was located in the interior of Pangea where it was subject to a hot arid desert climate with frequent flash floods leaving deposits that formed beds of red [[sedimentary]] rock.\n\n====Mesozoic====\nAs Pangaea drifted during the [[Triassic]], Great Britain moved away from the equator until it was between 20\u00b0 and 30\u00b0 north. The remnants of the Variscan uplands in [[France]] to the south were eroded down, resulting in layers of the New Red Sandstone being deposited across central England.\n\n[[Pangaea]] began to break up at the start of the [[Jurassic]] period. Sea levels rose and Britain drifted on the [[Eurasian Plate]] to between 31\u00b0 and 40\u00b0 north. Much of Britain was under water again, and [[sedimentary rock]]s were deposited and can now be found underlying much of England from the [[Cleveland Hills]] of [[Yorkshire]] to the [[Jurassic Coast]] in [[Geology of Dorset|Dorset]]. These include [[sandstone]]s, [[greensand (geology)|greensand]]s, [[oolite|oolitic]] [[limestone]] of the [[Cotswold Hills]], [[corallian limestone]] of the [[Vale of White Horse]] and the [[Portland Limestone|Isle of Portland]]. The burial of [[algae]] and [[bacteria]] below the mud of the sea floor during this time resulted in the formation of [[North Sea oil]] and [[natural gas]]\n[[File:Geological map - William Smith, 1815 - BL.jpg|thumb|1815 Geological by [[William Smith (geologist)|William Smith]].]]\nThe modern continents having formed, the [[Cretaceous]] saw the formation of the [[Atlantic Ocean]], gradually separating northern Scotland from [[North America]]. The land underwent a series of uplifts to form a fertile plain. After 20 million years or so, the seas started to flood the land again until much of Britain was again below the sea, though sea levels frequently changed. [[Chalk]] and [[flint]]s were deposited over much of Great Britain, now notably exposed at the [[White Cliffs of Dover]] and the [[Seven Sisters, Sussex|Seven Sisters]], and also forming [[Salisbury Plain]].\n\n====Cenozoic====\nBetween 63 and 52 Ma, the last volcanic rocks in Great Britain were formed. The major eruptions at this time produced the [[County Antrim|Antrim Plateau]], the [[basalt]]ic columns of the [[Giant's Causeway]] and [[Lundy Island]] in the [[Bristol Channel]].\n\nThe [[Alpine Orogeny]] that took place in Europe about 50 Ma, was responsible for the folding of strata in southern England, producing the [[London Basin]] [[syncline]], the [[Weald-Artois Anticline]] to the south, the [[North Downs]], [[South Downs]] and [[Chiltern Hills]].\n\nDuring the period the [[North Sea]] formed, Britain was [[Tectonic uplift|uplift]]ed. Some of this uplift was along old lines of weakness left from the Caledonian and Variscan Orogenies long before. The uplifted areas were then eroded, and further sediments, such as the [[London Clay]], were deposited over southern England.\n\nThe major changes during the last 2 million years were brought about by [[Quaternary glaciation|several recent ice ages]]. The most severe was the [[Anglian Stage|Anglian Glaciation]], with ice up to {{convert|1,000|m|ft|abbr=on}} thick that reached as far south as [[London]] and [[Bristol]]. This took place between about 478,000 to 424,000 years ago, and was responsible for the diversion of the [[River Thames]] onto its present course. During the most recent [[Devensian glaciation]], which ended a mere 10,000 years ago, the icesheet reached south to [[Wolverhampton]] and [[Cardiff]]. Among the features left behind by the ice are the [[fjord]]s of the west coast of Scotland, the [[glaciated valley|U-shaped valleys]] of the [[Lake District]] and [[Glacial erratic|erratic]]s (blocks of rock) that have been transported from the [[Oslo]] region of [[Norway]] and deposited on the coast of [[Yorkshire]].\n\nAmongst the most significant geological features created during the last twelve thousand years are the [[peat]] deposits of Scotland, and of coastal and upland areas of England and Wales.\n\nAt the present time Scotland is continuing to rise as a result of the weight of Devensian ice being lifted. Southern and eastern England is sinking, generally estimated at 1&nbsp;mm (1/25&nbsp;inch) per year, with the London area sinking at double the speed partly due to the continuing [[Compaction (geology)|compaction]] of the recent clay deposits.\n\n\n===Mountains and hills===\n[[File:BenNevis2005.jpg|thumb|At 1,345&nbsp;metres, [[Ben Nevis]] is the highest peak in the [[United Kingdom|UK]].]]\n\n{{Main|List of mountains and hills of the United Kingdom}}\n\nThe ten tallest [[mountain]]s in the UK are all found in Scotland.

However, if all crown dependencies and overseas territories are included then the total EEZ is {{convert|6,805,586|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} which is the 6th largest in the world.\n\n====Inlets====\n*[[Cardigan Bay]]\n*[[Lyme Bay]]\n*[[Bristol Channel]]\n*[[Thames Estuary]]\n*[[Morecambe Bay]]\n*[[Solway Firth]]\n*[[The Wash]]\n*[[Humber Estuary]]\n*[[Firth of Forth]]\n*[[Firth of Tay]]\n*[[Moray Firth]]\n*[[Firth of Clyde]]\n*[[Firth of Lorn]]\n\n====Headlands====\nThe geology of the United Kingdom is such that there are many [[headlands and bays|headlands]] along its coast. A [[list of headlands of the United Kingdom]] details many of them.\n\n===Islands===\n{{Main|List of islands of the United Kingdom}}\nIn total, it is estimated that the UK is made up of over one thousand small islands, the majority located off the north and west coasts of Scotland. About 130 of these are inhabited according to the 2001 Census.\n\nThe largest islands by country are [[Lewis and Harris]] in Scotland (841 square mi), Wales' [[Anglesey]] (276 square mi), the [[Isle of Wight]] in England (147.09 square mi), and [[Rathlin Island]] in Northern Ireland (roughly 6 square mi);\n\n===Climate===\n{{Main|Climate of the United Kingdom}}\n\nThe climate of the UK is generally [[temperate]], although significant local variation occurs, particularly as a result of altitude and distance from the coast. In general the south of the country is warmer than the north, and the west wetter than the east. Due to the warming influence of the [[Gulf Stream]], the UK is significantly warmer than some other locations at similar latitude, such as [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]].\n\nThe prevailing winds are southwesterly, from the [[North Atlantic Current]]. More than 50% of the days are overcast.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/summaries/actualmonthly|title=25 September 2017}}</ref> There are few natural hazards, although there can be strong winds and floods, especially in winter.\n\nAverage annual rainfall varies from over {{convert|3000|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in the [[Scottish Highlands]] down to {{convert|553|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in [[Cambridge]]. The county of [[Essex, England|Essex]] is one of the driest in the UK, with an average annual rainfall of around {{convert|600|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, although it typically rains on over 100 days per year. In some years rainfall in Essex can be below {{convert|450|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, less than the average annual rainfall in [[Jerusalem]] and [[Beirut]].\n\nThe highest temperature recorded in the UK was {{convert|38.7|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} at the [[Cambridge University Botanic Garden]] in [[Cambridge]], on 25 July 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/about-us/press-office/news/weather-and-climate/2019/new-official-highest-temperature-in-uk-confirmed|title=New official highest temperature in UK confirmed|author=Met Office|date=29 July 2019}}</ref> The lowest was {{convert|-27.2|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} recorded at [[Braemar]] in the [[Grampian Mountains (Scotland)|Grampian Mountains]], Scotland, on 11 February 1895 and 10 January 1982 and [[Altnaharra]], also in Scotland, on 30 December 1995.\n\n==Human geography==\n[[File:Uk-map.svg|200px|thumb|right|The [[United Kingdom]] is composed of four parts: [[England]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]].]]\n[[File:UnitedKingdomCitiesandTownsOMC.png|thumb|200px|The United Kingdom's [[City status in the United Kingdom|cities]], other large centres, and selected smaller places]]\n\n=== Demographics ===\n{{main|Demographics of the United Kingdom}}\n\n===Political geography===\n{{Main|Politics of the United Kingdom}}\n\n====National government====\nThe UK is governed as a whole by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. Of the four countries that make the UK, [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]] have devolved administrations and parliaments/assembly:\n*Northern Ireland \u2013 [[Northern Ireland Assembly]]\n*Scotland \u2013 [[Scottish Parliament]]\n*Wales \u2013 [[National Assembly for Wales]]\n\nEngland has no devolved system of government{{Clarify|date=March 2012}}that is, the Parliament of the United Kingdom serves as (and historically was) the English Parliament. It is governed by UK government ministers and legislated for by the UK parliament. Within England, London has a devolved assembly but proposals for elected [[Regional Assemblies in England]] were rejected in the first referendum covering [[North East England]]. ''See [[Government of England]].''\n\nThe UK (specifically, Northern Ireland) has an international land boundary with the [[Republic of Ireland]] of 499&nbsp;km.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> There is also a boundary between the jurisdiction of France and the UK on the Channel Tunnel.\n\n====Local government====\n{{Main|Local government in England|Local government in Scotland|Local government in Wales|Local government in Northern Ireland}}\n\nEach part of the UK is subdivided in further local governmental regions:\n*England: [[Unitary authorities of England|Unitary Authorities]], [[county council]]s, [[Districts of England|district councils]], [[Parish councils in England|parish councils]]\n*Wales: [[Subdivisions of Wales|Principal areas]], [[community council|communities]]\n*Scotland: [[Subdivisions of Scotland|Council areas]], [[community council|communities]]\n*Northern Ireland: [[Districts of Northern Ireland|Districts]]\n\nHistorically the UK was divided into counties or [[shire]]s: administrative areas through which all civil responsibilities of the [[government]] were passed. Each county or shire had a [[county town]] as its administrative centre and was divided into individual [[parish]]es that were defined along [[ecclesiastic]] boundaries.\n\nBetween 1889 (1890 in Scotland) and 1974, the political boundaries were based on the traditional counties, but due to changes in population centres, the traditional counties became impractical as local government areas in certain highly urbanised areas. The [[Local Government Act 1972]] created a new system of administrative counties, designed to take account of the widely differing populations across different parts of the country.\n\nIn the 1990s further population growth led to more political changes on a local level.  [[Unitary authority|Unitary authorities]] were formed across the entirety of Scotland and Wales, and in larger [[city|cities]] in England. Many unpopular administrative counties were also abolished at this time, leading to a mixture of two-tier and single-purpose authorities. Further reorganisations are planned if and when regional assemblies in England are revisited in the future.\n\n===Economic geography===\n{{Main|Economic geography of the United Kingdom}}\nThe economic geography of the UK reflects not only its current position in the global economy, but its long history both as a trading nation and an [[British empire|imperial power]].\n\nThe UK led the [[industrial revolution]] and its highly urban character is a legacy of this, with all its major cities being current or former centres of various forms of manufacturing. However, this in turn was built on its [[exploitation of natural resources]], especially [[coal]] and [[iron ore]].\n\n====Primary industry====\nThe UK's primary industry was once dominated by the [[coal]] industry, heavily concentrated in the north, the [[English Midlands|Midlands]] and [[south Wales]]. This is all but gone and the major primary industry is [[North Sea oil]]. Its activity is concentrated on the [[UK Continental Shelf]] to the north-east of [[Scotland]].\n\n====Manufacturing====\nThe UK's heavy manufacturing drove the industrial revolution. A map of the major UK cities gives a good picture of where this activity occurred, in particular [[Belfast]], [[Birmingham]], [[Glasgow]], [[Liverpool]], [[London]], [[Manchester]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] and [[Sheffield]]. Today there is no heavy manufacturing industry in which UK-based firms can be considered world leaders. However, areas of the UK still have a notable manufacturing base, including the [[English Midlands|Midlands]] which remains a strong manufacturing centre, and the [[North West England|North West]] which accounts for 60% of the United Kingdom's manufacturing output.<ref>{{cite news|title=1,800 new jobs to be created at Manchester Airport|url=http://www.itv.com/news/granada/2012-08-22/1-800-new-jobs-to-be-created-at-manchester-airport/|work=ITV News|date=22 August 2012|accessdate=25 September 2017}}</ref> More recently, high technology firms have concentrated largely along the [[M4 motorway]], partly because of access to [[Heathrow Airport]], but also because of agglomeration economies.\n\n====Finance and services====\nOnce, every large city had a [[stock exchange]]. Now, the UK financial industry is concentrated overwhelmingly in the [[City of London]] and [[Canary Wharf]], with back office and administrative operations often dispersed around the south of England. London is one of the world's great financial centres and is usually referred to as a [[world city]]. There is also a significant legal and [[ebusiness]] industry in [[Leeds]].\n\n====Regional disparity====\nThe effect of changing economic fortune has contributed to the creation of the so-called [[North-South divide in the United Kingdom|North-South divide]], in which decaying industrial and ex-industrial areas of Northern England, Scotland and Wales contrast with the wealthy, finance and technology-led southern economy. This has led successive governments to develop [[regional policy]] to try to rectify the imbalance. However, this is not to say that the north\u2013south divide is uniform; some of the worst pockets of deprivation can be found in [[London]], whilst parts of [[Cheshire]] and [[North Yorkshire]] are very wealthy. Nor is the [[North-South divide in the United Kingdom|North-South divide]] limited to the economic sphere; cultural and political divisions weigh heavily too.\n\n==Natural resources==\n{{Main|Economy of the United Kingdom}}\n\nHistorically, much of the United Kingdom was [[forest]]ed. Since [[prehistoric]] times, man has [[deforestation|deforested]] much of the United Kingdom.\n\n[[Agriculture]] is [[intensive agriculture|intensive]], highly [[mechanisation|mechanised]], and efficient by [[Europe]]an standards, producing about 60% of food needs with only 1% of the labour force. It contributes around 2% of [[Gross domestic product|GDP]]. Around two thirds of production is devoted to [[livestock]], one third to [[agronomy|arable]] crops.\n\nIn 1993, it was estimated that [[land use]] was:\n*[[Arable land]]: 25%\n*[[Permanent crop]]s: 0%\n*[[Pasture|Permanent pastures]]: 46%\n*[[Forest]]s and [[Woodland]]: 10%\n*Other: 19%\n*[[Irrigation|Irrigated]]: 1,080&nbsp;km\u00b2\n\nThe UK has a variety of natural resources including:\n*Geological: [[coal]], [[petroleum]], [[natural gas]], [[limestone]], [[chalk]], [[gypsum]], [[silica]], [[rock salt]], [[china clay]], [[iron ore]], [[tin]], [[silver]], [[gold]], [[lead]].\n*Agricultural:  [[arable land]], [[wheat]], [[barley]], [[domestic sheep|sheep]]\n\nThe UK has large [[coal]], [[natural gas]], and [[Petroleum|oil]] reserves; primary energy production accounts for 10% of [[Gross domestic product|GDP]], one of the highest shares of any [[industrial nation]]. Due to the island location of the UK, the country has great potential for generating electricity from [[wave power]] and [[tidal power]], although these have not yet been exploited on a commercial basis.\n\n==Environment==\n\n===Current issues===\nEngland is one of the most densely populated countries/regions in the world, and the most densely populated major nation in Europe.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/2967374/England-is-most-crowded-country-in-Europe.html|work=The Daily Telegraph|first=Urmee|last=Khan|title=England is most crowded country in Europe|date=16 September 2008|accessdate=25 September 2017}}</ref> The high population density (especially in the southeast of England) coupled with a changing climate, is likely to put extreme pressure on the United Kingdom's water resources in the future.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jan/22/england-rivers-environment-agency|work=The Observer|publisher=The Guardian|first=Robin|last=McKie|title=Urgent action needed to prevent England's rivers drying up|date=22 January 2012|accessdate=25 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe United Kingdom is reducing [[greenhouse]] gas emissions. It has met [[Kyoto Protocol]] target of a 12.5% reduction from 1990 levels and intends to meet the legally binding target of a 20% cut in emissions by 2010. By 2015, to recycle or compost at least 33% of household waste. Between 1998-99 and 1999\u20132000, household [[recycling]] increased from 8.8% to 10.3% respectively.\n\n===International agreements===\nThe United Kingdom is a party to many international agreements, including:\nAir Pollution, Air Pollution-[[Nitrogen Oxide]]s, Air Pollution-[[Sulfur|Sulphur]] 94, Air Pollution-Volatile Organic Compounds, [[Protocol on Environmental Protection to the

[[Geography of England|England]] consists of mostly lowland terrain, with upland or mountainous terrain only found north-west of the [[Tees-Exe line]]. The upland areas include the [[Lake District]], the [[Pennines]], [[North York Moors]], [[Exmoor]] and [[Dartmoor]]. The lowland areas are typically traversed by ranges of low hills, frequently composed of [[chalk]], and flat plains. [[Geography of Scotland|Scotland]] is the most mountainous country in the UK and its physical geography is distinguished by the [[Highland Boundary Fault]] which traverses the Scottish mainland from [[Helensburgh]] to [[Stonehaven]]. The faultline separates the two distinctively different regions of the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]] to the north and west, and the [[Scottish Lowlands|Lowlands]] to the south and east. The Highlands are predominantly mountainous, containing the majority of Scotland's mountainous landscape, while the Lowlands contain flatter land, especially across the [[Central Lowlands]], with upland and mountainous terrain located at the [[Southern Uplands]]. [[Geography of Wales|Wales]] is mostly mountainous, though [[south Wales]] is less mountainous than [[North Wales|north]] and [[mid Wales]]. [[Geography of Ireland|Northern Ireland]] consists of mostly hilly landscape and its geography includes the [[Mourne Mountains]] as well as [[Lough Neagh]], at {{convert|388|km2|sqmi|0}}, the largest body of water in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/ni/geog.htm|title=Geography of Northern Ireland|publisher=University of Ulster|accessdate=25 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe overall [[geomorphology]] of the UK was shaped by a combination of forces including [[tectonics]] and [[Climate change (general concept)|climate change]], in particular [[glaciation]] in northern and western areas.\n\nThe tallest mountain in the UK (and British Isles) is [[Ben Nevis]], in the [[Grampian Mountains]], Scotland. The longest river is the [[River Severn]] which flows from [[Wales]] into England. The largest lake by surface area is [[Lough Neagh]] in Northern Ireland, though Scotland's [[Loch Ness]] has the largest volume.\n\n=== Physical Geography ===\n{{See also|Geology of Great Britain|Geology of Ireland}}\n\nThe geology of the UK is complex and diverse, a result of it being subject to a variety of [[plate tectonic]] processes over a very extended period of time. Changing latitude and sea levels have been important factors in the nature of sedimentary sequences, whilst successive continental collisions have affected its [[Geological structure of Great Britain|geological structure]] with major faulting and folding being a legacy of each [[orogeny]] (mountain-building period), often associated with [[volcanism|volcanic]] activity and the metamorphism of existing rock sequences. As a result of this eventful geological history, the UK shows a rich variety of [[landscape]]s.<ref name=Toghill>{{cite book |title=The Geology of Britain: An Introduction |last=Toghill |first=Peter |authorlink= |author2= |year=2000 |publisher=Swan Hill Press |location= Shrewsbury|isbn=1-85310-890-1 }}</ref>\n\n====Precambrian====\nThe oldest rocks in the British Isles are the [[Lewisian gneiss]]es, metamorphic rocks found in the far north west of Scotland and in the [[Hebrides]] (with a few small outcrops elsewhere), which date from at least 2,700 Ma (Ma = million years ago). South and east of the gneisses are a complex mixture of rocks forming the North West [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]] and [[Grampian]] Highlands in Scotland. These are essentially the remains of folded [[sedimentary rock]]s that were deposited between 1,000 Ma and 670 Ma over the gneiss on what was then the floor of the [[Iapetus Ocean]].\n\n====Palaeozoic====\nAt 520 Ma, what is now Great Britain was split between two [[continent]]s; the north of Scotland was located on the continent of [[Laurentia]] at about 20\u00b0 south of the [[equator]], while the rest of the country was on the continent of [[Gondwana]] near the [[Antarctic Circle]]. In Gondwana, England and [[Wales]] were largely submerged under a shallow sea studded with [[volcano|volcanic]] islands. The remains of these islands underlie much of central England with small outcrops visible in many places.\n\nAbout 500 Ma southern Britain, the east coast of [[North America]] and south-east [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] broke away from Gondwana to form the continent of [[Avalonia]], which by 440 Ma had drifted to about 30\u00b0 south. During this period north Wales was subject to [[volcanism|volcanic]] activity. The remains of these volcanoes are still visible, one example of which is [[Rhobell Fawr]] dating from 510 Ma. Large quantities of volcanic [[lava]] and ash known as the [[Borrowdale Volcanics]] covered the [[Lake District]] and this can still be seen in the form of mountains such as [[Helvellyn]] and [[Scafell Pike]].\n\nBetween 425 and 400 Ma [[Avalonia]] had joined with the continent of [[Baltica]], and the combined landmass collided with [[Laurentia]] at about 20\u00b0 south, joining the southern and northern halves of [[Great Britain]] together. The resulting [[Caledonian Orogeny]] produced an [[Alps|Alpine]]-style mountain range in much of north and west Britain.\n\nThe collision between continents continued during the [[Devonian period]], producing uplift and subsequent erosion, resulting in the deposition of numerous sedimentary rock layers in lowlands and seas. The [[Old Red Sandstone]] and the contemporary volcanics and marine sediments found in [[Devon]] originated from these processes.\n\nAround 360 Ma Great Britain was lying at the equator, covered by the warm shallow waters of the [[Rheic Ocean]], during which time the Carboniferous Limestone was deposited, as found in the [[Mendip Hills]] and the [[Peak District]] of [[Derbyshire]]. Later, [[river delta]]s formed and the sediments deposited were colonised by [[swamp]]s and [[rain forest]]. It was in this environment that the [[Coal Measures]] were formed, the source of the majority of Britain's extensive [[coal]] reserves.\n\nAround 280 Ma the [[Variscan orogeny]] mountain-building period occurred, again due to collision of continental plates, causing major deformation in south west England. The general region of Variscan folding was south of an east\u2013west line roughly from south [[Pembrokeshire]] to [[Kent]]. Towards the end of this period [[granite]] was formed beneath the overlying rocks of [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]], now exposed at [[Dartmoor]] and [[Bodmin Moor]].\n\nBy the end of the Carboniferous period the various continents of the Earth had fused to form the super-continent of [[Pangaea]]. [[Great Britain|Britain]] was located in the interior of Pangea where it was subject to a hot arid desert climate with frequent flash floods leaving deposits that formed beds of red [[sedimentary]] rock.\n\n====Mesozoic====\nAs Pangaea drifted during the [[Triassic]], Great Britain moved away from the equator until it was between 20\u00b0 and 30\u00b0 north. The remnants of the Variscan uplands in [[France]] to the south were eroded down, resulting in layers of the New Red Sandstone being deposited across central England.\n\n[[Pangaea]] began to break up at the start of the [[Jurassic]] period. Sea levels rose and Britain drifted on the [[Eurasian Plate]] to between 31\u00b0 and 40\u00b0 north. Much of Britain was under water again, and [[sedimentary rock]]s were deposited and can now be found underlying much of England from the [[Cleveland Hills]] of [[Yorkshire]] to the [[Jurassic Coast]] in [[Geology of Dorset|Dorset]]. These include [[sandstone]]s, [[greensand (geology)|greensand]]s, [[oolite|oolitic]] [[limestone]] of the [[Cotswold Hills]], [[corallian limestone]] of the [[Vale of White Horse]] and the [[Portland Limestone|Isle of Portland]]. The burial of [[algae]] and [[bacteria]] below the mud of the sea floor during this time resulted in the formation of [[North Sea oil]] and [[natural gas]]\n[[File:Geological map - William Smith, 1815 - BL.jpg|thumb|1815 Geological by [[William Smith (geologist)|William Smith]].]]\nThe modern continents having formed, the [[Cretaceous]] saw the formation of the [[Atlantic Ocean]], gradually separating northern Scotland from [[North America]]. The land underwent a series of uplifts to form a fertile plain. After 20 million years or so, the seas started to flood the land again until much of Britain was again below the sea, though sea levels frequently changed. [[Chalk]] and [[flint]]s were deposited over much of Great Britain, now notably exposed at the [[White Cliffs of Dover]] and the [[Seven Sisters, Sussex|Seven Sisters]], and also forming [[Salisbury Plain]].\n\n====Cenozoic====\nBetween 63 and 52 Ma, the last volcanic rocks in Great Britain were formed. The major eruptions at this time produced the [[County Antrim|Antrim Plateau]], the [[basalt]]ic columns of the [[Giant's Causeway]] and [[Lundy Island]] in the [[Bristol Channel]].\n\nThe [[Alpine Orogeny]] that took place in Europe about 50 Ma, was responsible for the folding of strata in southern England, producing the [[London Basin]] [[syncline]], the [[Weald-Artois Anticline]] to the south, the [[North Downs]], [[South Downs]] and [[Chiltern Hills]].\n\nDuring the period the [[North Sea]] formed, Britain was [[Tectonic uplift|uplift]]ed. Some of this uplift was along old lines of weakness left from the Caledonian and Variscan Orogenies long before. The uplifted areas were then eroded, and further sediments, such as the [[London Clay]], were deposited over southern England.\n\nThe major changes during the last 2 million years were brought about by [[Quaternary glaciation|several recent ice ages]]. The most severe was the [[Anglian Stage|Anglian Glaciation]], with ice up to {{convert|1,000|m|ft|abbr=on}} thick that reached as far south as [[London]] and [[Bristol]]. This took place between about 478,000 to 424,000 years ago, and was responsible for the diversion of the [[River Thames]] onto its present course. During the most recent [[Devensian glaciation]], which ended a mere 10,000 years ago, the icesheet reached south to [[Wolverhampton]] and [[Cardiff]]. Among the features left behind by the ice are the [[fjord]]s of the west coast of Scotland, the [[glaciated valley|U-shaped valleys]] of the [[Lake District]] and [[Glacial erratic|erratic]]s (blocks of rock) that have been transported from the [[Oslo]] region of [[Norway]] and deposited on the coast of [[Yorkshire]].\n\nAmongst the most significant geological features created during the last twelve thousand years are the [[peat]] deposits of Scotland, and of coastal and upland areas of England and Wales.\n\nAt the present time Scotland is continuing to rise as a result of the weight of Devensian ice being lifted. Southern and eastern England is sinking, generally estimated at 1&nbsp;mm (1/25&nbsp;inch) per year, with the London area sinking at double the speed partly due to the continuing [[Compaction (geology)|compaction]] of the recent clay deposits.\n\n\n===Mountains and hills===\n[[File:BenNevis2005.jpg|thumb|At 1,345&nbsp;metres, [[Ben Nevis]] is the highest peak in the [[United Kingdom|UK]].]]\n\n{{Main|List of mountains and hills of the United Kingdom}}\n\nThe ten tallest [[mountain]]s in the UK are all found in Scotland.

About 130 of these are inhabited according to the 2001 Census.\n\nThe largest islands by country are [[Lewis and Harris]] in Scotland (841 square mi), Wales' [[Anglesey]] (276 square mi), the [[Isle of Wight]] in England (147.09 square mi), and [[Rathlin Island]] in Northern Ireland (roughly 6 square mi);\n\n===Climate===\n{{Main|Climate of the United Kingdom}}\n\nThe climate of the UK is generally [[temperate]], although significant local variation occurs, particularly as a result of altitude and distance from the coast. In general the south of the country is warmer than the north, and the west wetter than the east. Due to the warming influence of the [[Gulf Stream]], the UK is significantly warmer than some other locations at similar latitude, such as [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]].\n\nThe prevailing winds are southwesterly, from the [[North Atlantic Current]].

Within England, London has a devolved assembly but proposals for elected [[Regional Assemblies in England]] were rejected in the first referendum covering [[North East England]]. ''See [[Government of England]].''\n\nThe UK (specifically, Northern Ireland) has an international land boundary with the [[Republic of Ireland]] of 499&nbsp;km.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> There is also a boundary between the jurisdiction of France and the UK on the Channel Tunnel.\n\n====Local government====\n{{Main|Local government in England|Local government in Scotland|Local government in Wales|Local government in Northern Ireland}}\n\nEach part of the UK is subdivided in further local governmental regions:\n*England: [[Unitary authorities of England|Unitary Authorities]], [[county council]]s, [[Districts of England|district councils]], [[Parish councils in England|parish councils]]\n*Wales: [[Subdivisions of Wales|Principal areas]], [[community council|communities]]\n*Scotland: [[Subdivisions of Scotland|Council areas]], [[community council|communities]]\n*Northern Ireland: [[Districts of Northern Ireland|Districts]]\n\nHistorically the UK was divided into counties or [[shire]]s: administrative areas through which all civil responsibilities of the [[government]] were passed. Each county or shire had a [[county town]] as its administrative centre and was divided into individual [[parish]]es that were defined along [[ecclesiastic]] boundaries.\n\nBetween 1889 (1890 in Scotland) and 1974, the political boundaries were based on the traditional counties, but due to changes in population centres, the traditional counties became impractical as local government areas in certain highly urbanised areas. The [[Local Government Act 1972]] created a new system of administrative counties, designed to take account of the widely differing populations across different parts of the country.\n\nIn the 1990s further population growth led to more political changes on a local level.  [[Unitary authority|Unitary authorities]] were formed across the entirety of Scotland and Wales, and in larger [[city|cities]] in England. Many unpopular administrative counties were also abolished at this time, leading to a mixture of two-tier and single-purpose authorities. Further reorganisations are planned if and when regional assemblies in England are revisited in the future.\n\n===Economic geography===\n{{Main|Economic geography of the United Kingdom}}\nThe economic geography of the UK reflects not only its current position in the global economy, but its long history both as a trading nation and an [[British empire|imperial power]].\n\nThe UK led the [[industrial revolution]] and its highly urban character is a legacy of this, with all its major cities being current or former centres of various forms of manufacturing. However, this in turn was built on its [[exploitation of natural resources]], especially [[coal]] and [[iron ore]].\n\n====Primary industry====\nThe UK's primary industry was once dominated by the [[coal]] industry, heavily concentrated in the north, the [[English Midlands|Midlands]] and [[south Wales]]. This is all but gone and the major primary industry is [[North Sea oil]]. Its activity is concentrated on the [[UK Continental Shelf]] to the north-east of [[Scotland]].\n\n====Manufacturing====\nThe UK's heavy manufacturing drove the industrial revolution. A map of the major UK cities gives a good picture of where this activity occurred, in particular [[Belfast]], [[Birmingham]], [[Glasgow]], [[Liverpool]], [[London]], [[Manchester]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] and [[Sheffield]]. Today there is no heavy manufacturing industry in which UK-based firms can be considered world leaders. However, areas of the UK still have a notable manufacturing base, including the [[English Midlands|Midlands]] which remains a strong manufacturing centre, and the [[North West England|North West]] which accounts for 60% of the United Kingdom's manufacturing output.<ref>{{cite news|title=1,800 new jobs to be created at Manchester Airport|url=http://www.itv.com/news/granada/2012-08-22/1-800-new-jobs-to-be-created-at-manchester-airport/|work=ITV News|date=22 August 2012|accessdate=25 September 2017}}</ref> More recently, high technology firms have concentrated largely along the [[M4 motorway]], partly because of access to [[Heathrow Airport]], but also because of agglomeration economies.\n\n====Finance and services====\nOnce, every large city had a [[stock exchange]]. Now, the UK financial industry is concentrated overwhelmingly in the [[City of London]] and [[Canary Wharf]], with back office and administrative operations often dispersed around the south of England. London is one of the world's great financial centres and is usually referred to as a [[world city]]. There is also a significant legal and [[ebusiness]] industry in [[Leeds]].\n\n====Regional disparity====\nThe effect of changing economic fortune has contributed to the creation of the so-called [[North-South divide in the United Kingdom|North-South divide]], in which decaying industrial and ex-industrial areas of Northern England, Scotland and Wales contrast with the wealthy, finance and technology-led southern economy. This has led successive governments to develop [[regional policy]] to try to rectify the imbalance. However, this is not to say that the north\u2013south divide is uniform; some of the worst pockets of deprivation can be found in [[London]], whilst parts of [[Cheshire]] and [[North Yorkshire]] are very wealthy. Nor is the [[North-South divide in the United Kingdom|North-South divide]] limited to the economic sphere; cultural and political divisions weigh heavily too.\n\n==Natural resources==\n{{Main|Economy of the United Kingdom}}\n\nHistorically, much of the United Kingdom was [[forest]]ed. Since [[prehistoric]] times, man has [[deforestation|deforested]] much of the United Kingdom.\n\n[[Agriculture]] is [[intensive agriculture|intensive]], highly [[mechanisation|mechanised]], and efficient by [[Europe]]an standards, producing about 60% of food needs with only 1% of the labour force. It contributes around 2% of [[Gross domestic product|GDP]]. Around two thirds of production is devoted to [[livestock]], one third to [[agronomy|arable]] crops.\n\nIn 1993, it was estimated that [[land use]] was:\n*[[Arable land]]: 25%\n*[[Permanent crop]]s: 0%\n*[[Pasture|Permanent pastures]]: 46%\n*[[Forest]]s and [[Woodland]]: 10%\n*Other: 19%\n*[[Irrigation|Irrigated]]: 1,080&nbsp;km\u00b2\n\nThe UK has a variety of natural resources including:\n*Geological: [[coal]], [[petroleum]], [[natural gas]], [[limestone]], [[chalk]], [[gypsum]], [[silica]], [[rock salt]], [[china clay]], [[iron ore]], [[tin]], [[silver]], [[gold]], [[lead]].\n*Agricultural:  [[arable land]], [[wheat]], [[barley]], [[domestic sheep|sheep]]\n\nThe UK has large [[coal]], [[natural gas]], and [[Petroleum|oil]] reserves; primary energy production accounts for 10% of [[Gross domestic product|GDP]], one of the highest shares of any [[industrial nation]]. Due to the island location of the UK, the country has great potential for generating electricity from [[wave power]] and [[tidal power]], although these have not yet been exploited on a commercial basis.\n\n==Environment==\n\n===Current issues===\nEngland is one of the most densely populated countries/regions in the world, and the most densely populated major nation in Europe.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/2967374/England-is-most-crowded-country-in-Europe.html|work=The Daily Telegraph|first=Urmee|last=Khan|title=England is most crowded country in Europe|date=16 September 2008|accessdate=25 September 2017}}</ref> The high population density (especially in the southeast of England) coupled with a changing climate, is likely to put extreme pressure on the United Kingdom's water resources in the future.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jan/22/england-rivers-environment-agency|work=The Observer|publisher=The Guardian|first=Robin|last=McKie|title=Urgent action needed to prevent England's rivers drying up|date=22 January 2012|accessdate=25 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe United Kingdom is reducing [[greenhouse]] gas emissions. It has met [[Kyoto Protocol]] target of a 12.5% reduction from 1990 levels and intends to meet the legally binding target of a 20% cut in emissions by 2010. By 2015, to recycle or compost at least 33% of household waste.
