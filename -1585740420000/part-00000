Naxalbari is famous for being the site of a 1967 revolt that would eventually lead to the [[Naxalite\u2013Maoist insurgency]].\n\n==History==\n{{main article|Communist Party of India (Marxist\u2013Leninist)}}\nNaxalbari became famous for being the site of a left-wing poor peasants uprising in 1967, which began with the \"land to tiller\" slogan, an uprising continuing to this day (see [[Naxalite]]).\n\nThe [[Naxalbari uprising]] was triggered on 25 May 1967 at Bengai Jote village in Naxalbari when the police opened fire on a group of villagers who were demanding their right to the crops at a particular piece of land. The firing killed 9 adults and 2 unknown children.\n \nThe CPI(ML) have put up busts of Lenin, Stalin, Mao and [[Charu Majumdar|Charu Majumder]] on that piece of land. The spot has Bengai Jote Primary School next to it. There is a memorial column erected that has the names of the people who died during the police firing. The names are 1. Dhaneswari Devi (F), 2. Simaswari Mullick (F), 3. Nayaneswari Mullick (F), 4. Surubala Burman (F), 5. Sonamati Singh (F), 6. Fulmati Devi (F), 7. Samsari Saibani (F), 8. Gaudrau Saibani (M), 9.

The firing killed 9 adults and 2 unknown children.\n \nThe CPI(ML) have put up busts of Lenin, Stalin, Mao and [[Charu Majumdar|Charu Majumder]] on that piece of land. The spot has Bengai Jote Primary School next to it. There is a memorial column erected that has the names of the people who died during the police firing. The names are 1. Dhaneswari Devi (F), 2.
