It is principally funded by the direct grants from the Australian government but is expressly independent of government and partisan politics.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} The ABC plays a leading role in journalistic independence {{citation needed|date=March 2020}} and is fundamental in the history of broadcasting in Australia.\n\nModeled on the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] in the United Kingdom, which is owned and controlled by the UK government, the ABC was originally financed by consumer licence fees on broadcast receivers. Licence fees were abolished in 1973 and replaced principally by direct government grants, as well as revenue from commercial activities related to its core broadcasting mission.\n\nThe ABC now provides radio, television, online and mobile services throughout metropolitan and regional Australia and overseas through [[ABC Australia (Asia-Pacific Television)|ABC Australia]] and [[Radio Australia]]. The ABC's headquarters is in [[Ultimo, New South Wales|Ultimo]], an inner-city suburb of [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]].\n\n==Origin==\nFounded in 1929 as the [[Australian Broadcasting Company]], the ABC was a Government licensed consortium of private entertainment and content providers, authorised under supervision to broadcast on the airwaves using a two-tiered system. The \"A\" system derived its funds primarily from the licence fees levied on the purchasers of the radio receivers, with an emphasis on building the radio wave infrastructure into regional and remote areas, whilst the \"B\" system relied on privateers and their capacity to establish viable enterprises using the new technology. Following the general downward economic trends of the era, as entrepreneurial ventures in National infrastructure struggled with viability, the \"Company\" was subsequently acquired to become a fully state-owned corporation on 1 July 1932 and renamed as '''Australian Broadcasting Commission''', re-aligning more closely to the British, BBC model.\n\nThe ''Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983''<ref name=\"abc-act83\" /> changed the name of the organisation to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, effective 1 July 1983.<ref name=\"abc-act83\" /> Although funded and owned by the government, the ABC remains [[editorial independence|editorially independent]] as ensured through the ''Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983''.<ref name=\"abc-act83\" />\n\nThe ABC is sometimes informally referred to as \"Aunty\",<ref name=\"NewTeethForAunty\">{{cite web |title=New Teeth for Aunty: Reinvigorating the National Broadcaster |url=http://www.themonthly.com.au/reinvigorating-national-broadcaster-new-teeth-aunty-robert-manne-749 |date=1 December 2007 | work=Monthly |author=Robert Manne|accessdate=7 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2007-07-16/aunty-celebrates-75th-birthday-in-townsville/2503718|title=Aunty celebrates 75th birthday in Townsville|last=|first=|date=16 July 2007|work=ABC News|access-date=1 August 2018|language=en-AU}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2012/06/28/3534787.htm|title=Why I love Aunty at 80|last=|first=|date=28 June 2012|website=ABC|accessdate=7 September 2012}}</ref> originally in imitation of the [[BBC#Attitudes toward the BBC in popular culture|British Broadcasting Corporation's nickname]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fabc.org.au/fabc/fabc_archive_data/background_briefing/bb104/bb4_9.html |title=Aunty, a personality of steady and solid conservatism |work=Background briefing 4 \u2013 Ken Inglis |publisher=Friends of the ABC |accessdate=29 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127091453/http://www.fabc.org.au/fabc/fabc_archive_data/background_briefing/bb104/bb4_9.html |archive-date=27 January 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation}}\n\n===1920s\u201340s===\n{{See also|Australian Broadcasting Company}}\nThe first public radio station in Australia opened in Sydney on 23 November 1923 under the call sign 2SB with other stations in Melbourne, [[Brisbane]], [[Adelaide]], [[Perth]] and [[Hobart]] following.<ref name=\"abcradio100\">{{cite web\n| title = Celebrating 100 Years of Radio \u2013 History of ABC Radio\n| publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation\n| url = http://abc.net.au/radio/celebrate100/history.htm\n| accessdate =3 October 2007\n}}</ref> A licensing scheme, administered by the [[Postmaster-General's Department]], was soon established allowing certain stations government funding, albeit with restrictions placed on their advertising content.<ref name=\"langdon95\">{{cite web | year = 1996\n | first = Jeff | last = Langdon | title = The History of Radio in Australia\n | publisher = Radio 5UV| url = http://www.acmi.net.au/AIC/RADIO_HIST_AUS.html\n | archive-url = http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/13071/20040303-0000/www.acmi.net.au/AIC/RADIO_HIST_AUS.html\n | url-status = dead\n | archive-date = 3 March 2004\n | accessdate =16 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nFollowing a 1927 [[royal commission]] inquiry into radio licensing issues, the government established the National Broadcasting Service which subsequently took over a number of the larger funded stations.

The letters \"ABC\" were added to the design and it was adopted as the ABC's official logo. Kennard was presented with [[Australian pound|\u00a3]]25 for his design.<ref name=\"atvh-50s60s\"/>\n\nOn 19 October 1974, the Lissajous curve design experienced its first facelift with the line thickened to allow for colour to be used. It would also be treated to the \u2018over and under\u2019 effect, showing the crossover of the line in the design. This logo would be served as the longest-running design with a lifespan of 44 years and 28 on its first on-air run. To celebrate its 70th anniversary on 1 July 2002, the ABC adopted a new logo, which was created by (Annette) Harcus Design in 2001. This logo utilized a silver 3D texture but the crossover design was left intact. This logo would then be used across the ABC's media outlets. However, some brands may continue to use this logo. The 2002 silver logo is no longer in use by the corporation, with the exception of some of the ABC's radio station logos. After the on-air revival of the 1974 logo since 2014, the ABC gradually reinstated the classic symbol while using a new logotype in 2018. The change comes with a press release that the ABC released on 12 February announcing a new brand positioning under its tagline, ''Yours''.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Television|Australia}}\n* [[History of broadcasting in Australia]]\n* [[Pool (website)|Pool]], a website hosted by the ABC\n* [[Timeline of Australian radio]]\n* [[Gold Walkley]]\n* ''[[Radio Times (Australia)|Radio Times]]'', an Australian radio magazine\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Cater, Nick ''The Lucky Culture and the Rise of an Australian Ruling Class '' (2013) pp 199\u2013228\n* Curgenven, Geoffrey.

It is principally funded by the direct grants from the Australian government but is expressly independent of government and partisan politics.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} The ABC plays a leading role in journalistic independence {{citation needed|date=March 2020}} and is fundamental in the history of broadcasting in Australia.\n\nModeled on the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] in the United Kingdom, which is owned and controlled by the UK government, the ABC was originally financed by consumer licence fees on broadcast receivers. Licence fees were abolished in 1973 and replaced principally by direct government grants, as well as revenue from commercial activities related to its core broadcasting mission.\n\nThe ABC now provides radio, television, online and mobile services throughout metropolitan and regional Australia and overseas through [[ABC Australia (Asia-Pacific Television)|ABC Australia]] and [[Radio Australia]]. The ABC's headquarters is in [[Ultimo, New South Wales|Ultimo]], an inner-city suburb of [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]].\n\n==Origin==\nFounded in 1929 as the [[Australian Broadcasting Company]], the ABC was a Government licensed consortium of private entertainment and content providers, authorised under supervision to broadcast on the airwaves using a two-tiered system. The \"A\" system derived its funds primarily from the licence fees levied on the purchasers of the radio receivers, with an emphasis on building the radio wave infrastructure into regional and remote areas, whilst the \"B\" system relied on privateers and their capacity to establish viable enterprises using the new technology. Following the general downward economic trends of the era, as entrepreneurial ventures in National infrastructure struggled with viability, the \"Company\" was subsequently acquired to become a fully state-owned corporation on 1 July 1932 and renamed as '''Australian Broadcasting Commission''', re-aligning more closely to the British, BBC model.\n\nThe ''Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983''<ref name=\"abc-act83\" /> changed the name of the organisation to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, effective 1 July 1983.<ref name=\"abc-act83\" /> Although funded and owned by the government, the ABC remains [[editorial independence|editorially independent]] as ensured through the ''Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983''.<ref name=\"abc-act83\" />\n\nThe ABC is sometimes informally referred to as \"Aunty\",<ref name=\"NewTeethForAunty\">{{cite web |title=New Teeth for Aunty: Reinvigorating the National Broadcaster |url=http://www.themonthly.com.au/reinvigorating-national-broadcaster-new-teeth-aunty-robert-manne-749 |date=1 December 2007 | work=Monthly |author=Robert Manne|accessdate=7 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2007-07-16/aunty-celebrates-75th-birthday-in-townsville/2503718|title=Aunty celebrates 75th birthday in Townsville|last=|first=|date=16 July 2007|work=ABC News|access-date=1 August 2018|language=en-AU}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2012/06/28/3534787.htm|title=Why I love Aunty at 80|last=|first=|date=28 June 2012|website=ABC|accessdate=7 September 2012}}</ref> originally in imitation of the [[BBC#Attitudes toward the BBC in popular culture|British Broadcasting Corporation's nickname]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fabc.org.au/fabc/fabc_archive_data/background_briefing/bb104/bb4_9.html |title=Aunty, a personality of steady and solid conservatism |work=Background briefing 4 \u2013 Ken Inglis |publisher=Friends of the ABC |accessdate=29 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127091453/http://www.fabc.org.au/fabc/fabc_archive_data/background_briefing/bb104/bb4_9.html |archive-date=27 January 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation}}\n\n===1920s\u201340s===\n{{See also|Australian Broadcasting Company}}\nThe first public radio station in Australia opened in Sydney on 23 November 1923 under the call sign 2SB with other stations in Melbourne, [[Brisbane]], [[Adelaide]], [[Perth]] and [[Hobart]] following.<ref name=\"abcradio100\">{{cite web\n| title = Celebrating 100 Years of Radio \u2013 History of ABC Radio\n| publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation\n| url = http://abc.net.au/radio/celebrate100/history.htm\n| accessdate =3 October 2007\n}}</ref> A licensing scheme, administered by the [[Postmaster-General's Department]], was soon established allowing certain stations government funding, albeit with restrictions placed on their advertising content.<ref name=\"langdon95\">{{cite web | year = 1996\n | first = Jeff | last = Langdon | title = The History of Radio in Australia\n | publisher = Radio 5UV| url = http://www.acmi.net.au/AIC/RADIO_HIST_AUS.html\n | archive-url = http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/13071/20040303-0000/www.acmi.net.au/AIC/RADIO_HIST_AUS.html\n | url-status = dead\n | archive-date = 3 March 2004\n | accessdate =16 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nFollowing a 1927 [[royal commission]] inquiry into radio licensing issues, the government established the National Broadcasting Service which subsequently took over a number of the larger funded stations.

The letters \"ABC\" were added to the design and it was adopted as the ABC's official logo. Kennard was presented with [[Australian pound|\u00a3]]25 for his design.<ref name=\"atvh-50s60s\"/>\n\nOn 19 October 1974, the Lissajous curve design experienced its first facelift with the line thickened to allow for colour to be used. It would also be treated to the \u2018over and under\u2019 effect, showing the crossover of the line in the design. This logo would be served as the longest-running design with a lifespan of 44 years and 28 on its first on-air run. To celebrate its 70th anniversary on 1 July 2002, the ABC adopted a new logo, which was created by (Annette) Harcus Design in 2001. This logo utilized a silver 3D texture but the crossover design was left intact. This logo would then be used across the ABC's media outlets. However, some brands may continue to use this logo. The 2002 silver logo is no longer in use by the corporation, with the exception of some of the ABC's radio station logos. After the on-air revival of the 1974 logo since 2014, the ABC gradually reinstated the classic symbol while using a new logotype in 2018. The change comes with a press release that the ABC released on 12 February announcing a new brand positioning under its tagline, ''Yours''.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Television|Australia}}\n* [[History of broadcasting in Australia]]\n* [[Pool (website)|Pool]], a website hosted by the ABC\n* [[Timeline of Australian radio]]\n* [[Gold Walkley]]\n* ''[[Radio Times (Australia)|Radio Times]]'', an Australian radio magazine\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Cater, Nick ''The Lucky Culture and the Rise of an Australian Ruling Class '' (2013) pp 199\u2013228\n* Curgenven, Geoffrey.
