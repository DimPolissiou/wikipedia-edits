There are no contemporary sources; information regarding Lucretia, her rape and suicide, and the consequence of this being the start of the Roman Republic, come from the later accounts of Roman historian [[Livy]] and Greco-Roman historian [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]].\n\nThe incident kindled the flames of dissatisfaction over the tyrannical methods of the last king of Rome, [[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus]]. As a result, the prominent families instituted a republic, drove the extensive royal family of Tarquin from Rome, and successfully defended the republic against attempted [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] and [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latin]] intervention. The rape itself became a major theme in European art and literature.\n\nOne of the first two [[consul]]s of the Roman Republic, [[Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus]] was Lucretia's husband. All the numerous sources on the establishment of the republic reiterate the basic events of Lucretia's story, though accounts vary slightly. Lucretia's story is not considered a [[myth]] by most historians, but rather a historical [[legend]] about an early history that was already a major part of Roman [[folklore]] before it was first written about. The evidence points to the historical existence of a woman named Lucretia and a historical incident that played a critical part in the real downfall of a real monarchy. Many of the specific details, though, are debatable, and vary depending on the writer. Post-Roman uses of the legend typically became mythical in portrayal, being of artistic rather than historical merit.\n\nAs the events of the story move rapidly, the date of the incident is probably the same year as the first of the ''[[fasti]]''. Dionysius of Halicarnassus, a major source, sets this year \"at the beginning of the sixty-eighth [[Olympiad]] ... [[Isagoras]] being the annual [[archon]] at [[Athens]]\";<ref>D.H. V.1.</ref> that is, 508/507&nbsp;BC (the ancient calendars split years over modern ones). According to this source Lucretia therefore died in 508&nbsp;BC. The other historical sources tend to support this date, but the year is debatable within a range of about five years.<ref>{{cite book |first=Timothy J |last=Cornell |title=The Beginnings of Rome: Italy and Rome from the Bronze Age to the Punic Wars (c. 1000\u2013264&nbsp;BC) |series=The Routledge History of the Ancient World |chapter=9.

Prior to the rape, while her husband was an man of excellent social standing, he had no political power or standing in Rome. He lacked both the power and the wealth of his Tarquinius relatives. Her marriage was depicted as being the ideal Roman marriage as both Lucretia and Lucius were faithfully devoted to one another. She was described as beautiful and virtuous by Roman writer Livy. While her husband was away at battle, Lucretia would stay at home and pray for his safe return. Similar to Livy, [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus|Dionysius]]' depiction of Lucretia, separates her from the rest of Roman women in a story about the men returning home from a battle. The narrative begins with a bet between the sons of Tarquinius and their kinsmen, [[Lucius Junius Brutus|Brutus]] and [[Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus|Collantinus]]. The men fight over which of their wives best exemplified [[sophrosyne]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Mallan|first=C|date=2014|title=THE RAPE OF LUCRETIA IN CASSIUS DIO'S ROMAN HISTORY|url=|journal=The Classical Quarterly|edition=2|volume=64|pages=758-771|via=}}</ref> The men return home to find the women socializing with each other, presumably drinking and in conversation. In contrast, they find Lucretia home alone working with her wool in silence.

The most common type of depiction.]]\n[[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus]], last king of Rome, being engaged in the siege of [[Ardea (RM)|Ardea]], sent his son, [[Sextus Tarquinius|Tarquin]], on a military errand to [[Collatia]]. Tarquin was received with great hospitality at the governor's mansion, home of [[Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus]], son of the king's nephew, [[Arruns Tarquinius (Egerius)|Arruns Tarquinius]], former governor of Collatia and first of the [[Tarquinius|Tarquinii Collatini]]. Collatinus' wife, Lucretia, daughter of [[Spurius Lucretius]], prefect of Rome, \"a man of distinction,\"<ref name=DHIV64>D.H. IV.64.</ref> made sure that the king's son was treated as became his rank, although her husband was away at the siege.\n\nIn a variant of the story,<ref>T.L. I.57.</ref> Tarquin and Collatinus, at a wine party on furlough, were debating the virtues of wives when Collatinus volunteered to settle the debate by all of them riding to his home to see what Lucretia was doing. She was weaving with her maids. The party awarded her the palm of victory and Collatinus invited them to visit, but for the time being they returned to camp.\n\nAt night, Tarquin entered her bedroom by stealth, quietly going around the slaves who were sleeping at her door. She awakened. He identified himself and offered her two choices: she could submit to his sexual advances and become his wife and future queen, or he would kill her and one of her slaves and place the bodies together, then claim he had caught her having adulterous sex (see [[sexuality in ancient Rome]] for Roman attitudes toward sex). In the alternative story, he returned from camp a few days later with one companion to take Collatinus up on his invitation to visit and was lodged in a guest bedroom. He entered Lucretia's room while she lay naked in her bed and started to wash her belly with water, which woke her up.\n\n==Consequences==\nTarquin returned to camp. The next day Lucretia dressed in black and went to her father's house in Rome and cast herself down in the supplicant's position (embracing the knees), weeping. Asked to explain herself, she insisted on first summoning witnesses and after disclosing the rape, called on them for vengeance, a plea that could not be ignored, as she was speaking to the chief magistrate of Rome. While they were debating the proper course of action, she drew a concealed dagger and stabbed herself in the heart. She died in her father's arms, with the women present [[keening]] and lamenting. \"This dreadful scene struck the Romans who were present with so much horror and compassion that they all cried out with one voice that they would rather die a thousand deaths in defence of their liberty than suffer such outrages to be committed by the tyrants.\"<ref>D.H. IV.66.</ref>\n\nIn the alternative version, she did not go to Rome, but sent for her father and her husband asking them to bring one friend each. Those selected were [[Publius Valerius Publicola]] from Rome and [[Lucius Junius Brutus]] from the camp at Ardea. They found Lucretia in her room. She explained what had happened and after exacting an oath of vengeance\u2014\"Pledge me your solemn word that the adulterer shall not go unpunished.\"\u2014<ref name=TLI58>T.L. I.58.</ref> and while they were discussing the matter, drew the poignard and stabbed herself in her heart.\n\nIn another version Collatinus and Brutus were encountered returning to Rome unaware, were briefed, and were brought to the death scene. Brutus happened to be a politically motivated participant. By kinship he was a Tarquin on his mother's side, the son of Tarquinia, daughter of [[Lucius Tarquinius Priscus]], the third king before last. He was a candidate for the throne if anything should happen to Superbus. By law, however, as he was a Junius on his father's side, he was not a Tarquin and therefore could later propose the exile of the Tarquins without fear for himself. Superbus had taken his inheritance and left him a pittance, keeping him at court for entertainment.<ref>D.H. IV.68.</ref>\n\n[[File:N03Brutus-u-Lucretia.jpg|thumb|left|The less common subject of [[Lucius Junius Brutus|Brutus]] holding the dead Lucretia and swearing the oath]]\nCollatinus, seeing his wife dead, became distraught. He held her, kissed her, called her name and spoke to her. Seeing the hand of Destiny in these events, his friend Brutus called the grieving party to order, explained that his simplicity had been a sham, and proposed that they drive the Tarquins from Rome. Grasping the bloody dagger,<ref>D.H. IV.70.</ref> he swore by Mars and all the other gods that he would do everything in his power to overthrow the dominion of the Tarquinii and that he would neither be reconciled to the tyrants himself nor tolerate any who should be reconciled to them, but would look upon every man who thought otherwise as an enemy and till his death would pursue with unrelenting hatred both the tyranny and its abettors; and if he should violate his oath, he prayed that he and his children might meet with the same end as Lucretia.\n\nHe passed the dagger around and each mourner swore the same oath by it. The two stories agree on this point: Livy's version is:<ref name=TLI59>T.L. I.59.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>By this blood\u2014most pure before the outrage wrought by the king's son\u2014I swear, and you, O gods, I call to witness that I will drive hence Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, together with his cursed wife and his whole blood, with fire and sword and every means in my power, and I will not suffer them or anyone else to reign in Rome.</blockquote>\n\n==Revolution==\n[[File:7031 Lucrecia romana.jpg|thumbnail|right|''Lucretia'' by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] ]]\n[[File:Gentileschi-Lucrezia-Potsdam.jpg|thumb|The rape, by [[Artemisia Gentileschi]]]]\n{{Main article|Overthrow of the Roman monarchy}}\nThe newly sworn revolutionary committee paraded the bloody corpse of Lucretia to the [[Roman Forum]] '''w'''here it remained on display as a reminder of the dishonor committed. At the form, the committee heard grievances against the Tarquins and began to enlist an army to abolish the monarchy. Brutus \"urged them to act as men and Romans and take up arms against their insolent foes.\"<ref name=TLI59/> The gates of Rome were blockaded by the new revolutionary soldiers and more were sent to guard Collatia. By now a crowd had gathered in the forum; the presence of the magistrates among the revolutionaries kept them in good order.\n\nBrutus was the Tribune of the Celeres, a minor office of some religious duties, which as a [[Magistrates' court|magistracy]] gave him the theoretical power to summon the [[curiae]], an organization of patrician families used mainly to ratify the decrees of the king. Summoning them on the spot he transformed the crowd into an authoritative legislative assembly and began to address them in one of the more noted and effective speeches of ancient Rome.\n\nHe began by revealing that his pose as fool was a sham designed to protect him against an evil king. He levelled a number of charges against the king and his family: the outrage against Lucretia, whom everyone could see on the dais, the king's tyranny, the forced labor of the [[plebeians]] in the ditches and sewers of Rome. In his speech, he pointed out that Superbus had come to rule by the murder of [[Servius Tullius]], his wife's father, next-to-the-last king of Rome. He \"solemnly invoked the gods as the avengers of murdered parents.\" He suggested that as the king's wife, [[Tullia (daughter of Servius Tullius)|Tullia]], was in fact in Rome and probably was a witness to the proceedings from her palace near the forum. Seeing herself the target of so much animosity she fled from the palace in fear of her life and proceeded to the camp at Ardea.<ref name=TLI59/>\n\nBrutus opened a debate on the form of government Rome ought to have, a debate at which many [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]] spoke. In summation he proposed the banishment of the Tarquins from all the territories of Rome and appointment of an [[interrex]] to nominate new magistrates and conduct an election of ratification. They decided on a republican form of government with two consuls in place of a king executing the will of a patrician senate. This was a temporary measure until they could consider the details more carefully. Brutus renounced all right to the throne. In subsequent years the powers of the king were divided among various elected magistracies.\n\nA final vote of the curiae carried the interim constitution. Spurius Lucretius was swiftly elected interrex; he was prefect of the city already. He proposed Brutus and Collatinus as the first two consuls and that choice was ratified by the curiae. Needing to acquire the assent of the population as a whole, they paraded Lucretia through the streets summoning the plebeians to legal assembly in the forum. Once there they heard a constitutional speech by Brutus not unlike many speeches and documents of western civilization subsequently. It began:<ref>D.H. IV.78.</ref>\n\n{{quote|In as much as Tarquinius neither obtained the sovereignty in accordance with our ancestral customs and laws, nor, since he obtained it\u2014in whatever manner he got it\u2014has he been exercising it in an honourable or kingly manner, but has surpassed in insolence and lawlessness all the tyrants the world ever saw, we patricians met together and resolved to deprive him of his power, a thing we ought to have done long ago, but are doing now when a favourable opportunity has offered. And we have called you together, plebeians, in order to declare our own decision and then ask for your assistance in achieving liberty for our country ....}}\n\nA general election was held and the vote won in favor of the republic. This ended the monarchy, and during these proceedings Lucretia was still displayed in the forum.\n\nThe constitutional consequences of this event were, prevented Rome from having another hereditary \"king,\" [[Roman Empire|later emperors]] were absolute rulers in all but name. This constitutional tradition prevented both [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Octavian Augustus]] from accepting a crown; instead they had to devise a confluence of several [[Roman Republic|republican offices]] onto their persons in order to secure absolute power. Their [[Roman emperor|successors]] both in [[Western Roman Empire|Rome]] and in [[Byzantine Emperor|Constantinople]] adhered to this tradition in form if not in essence, and the office of German [[Holy Roman Emperor]] remained elective rather than hereditary\u2014up to its abolition in the [[Napoleonic Wars]], over 2300 years later.[[File:Sandro Botticelli 078.jpg|thumb|Detail of ''[[The Story of Lucretia (Botticelli)|The Story of Lucretia]]'' ({{circa|1500\u201301}}), by [[Sandro Botticelli]].

In his account her husband has boasted of the virtue of his wife to Tarquin and others. Livy contrasts the virtue of the Roman Lucretia, who remained in her room weaving, with the Etruscan ladies who feasted with friends. Ovid recounts the story of Lucretia in Book II of his ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'', published in 8 AD, concentrating on the bold over-reaching character of Tarquin. Later, [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] made use of the figure of Lucretia in ''[[The City of God]]'' (published 426 AD) to defend the honour of Christian women who had been raped in the sack of Rome and had not committed suicide.\n\nThe story of Lucretia was a popular moral tale in the later Middle Ages.  Lucretia appears to [[Dante]] in the section of Limbo reserved to the nobles of Rome and other \"virtuous pagans\" in Canto IV of the [[Inferno (Dante)|''Inferno'']]. [[Christine de Pizan]] used Lucretia just as St. Augustine of Hippo did in her ''City of Ladies'', defending a woman's sanctity.\n\nThe myth is recounted in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Legend of Good Women]]'', and it follows a similar story line to Livy's. Lucretia calls for her father and husband, but Chaucer's tale also has her call for her mother and attendants as well, whereas Livy's has both her father and husband bring an friend as witness. The tale also deviated from Livy's account as it begins with her husband coming home to surprise her, rather than the men placing an bet on the virtue of their wives. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/English/GoodWomen.php#anchor_Toc186791816|title=The Legend of Good Women|last=Chaucer|first=Geoffery|date=2008|website=Poetry in Translation|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n[[John Gower]]'s ''[[Confessio Amantis]]'' (Book VII)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://d.lib.rochester.edu/teams/text/peck-gower-confessio-amantis-book-7|title=Confessio Amantis|last=Gower|first=John|date=2004|website=Rochester|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>,and [[John Lydgate]]'s ''[[Fall of Princes]] recount the myth of Lucretia''.

Shakespeare's poem, based off the rape of Lucretia, draws on the beginning of the Livy's account of the incident. The poem begins with a bet between husbands about the virtuousness of their wives. Shakespeare draws on the idea of Lucretia as a moral agent, as Livy did, when he explores his characters response to death and her unwillingness to yield to her rapist. A direct excerpt from Livy is used when Shakespeare prefaces his poem with a brief prose called \"Argument\".

[[Ernst Krenek]] set [[Emmet Lavery]]'s [[libretto]] ''[[Tarquin (opera)|Tarquin]]'' (1940), a version in a contemporary setting.\n\n[[Jacques Gallot]] (died {{circa|1690}}) composed the allemandes \"[[Lucr\u00e8ce]]\" and \"[[Tarquin (Gallot)|Tarquin]]\" for baroque lute.\n\nIn [[Samuel Richardson]]'s 1740 novel ''[[Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded|Pamela]]'', Mr. B. cites the story of Lucretia as a reason why Pamela ought not fear for her reputation, should he rape her. Pamela quickly sets him straight with a better reading of the story. Colonial Mexican poet [[Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz]] also mentions Lucrecia in her poem \"Redondillas,\" a commentary on prostitution and who is to blame.\n\nIn 1769, doctor [[Joan Ramis]] wrote a tragedy in [[Menorca]] entitled ''Lucrecia''. The play is written in the [[Catalan language]] using a neoclassical style and is the most important work of the eighteenth century written in this language.\n\nIn 1932, the play ''Lucrece'' was produced on Broadway starring legendary actress [[Katharine Cornell]] in the title part. It was mostly performed in [[pantomime]].\n\nIn [[Donna Leon]]'s 2009 Venetian novel, ''About Face'', Franca Marinello refers to the tale of Tarquin and Lucrezia, as recounted in [[Ovid]]'s '' Fasti '' (Book II, for February 24, \"Regifugium\") to explain her actions to Commissario Brunetti.\n\n==Subject in Art==\nSince the Renaissance, the suicide of Lucretia has been an enduring subject for visual artists, including [[Titian]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer|D\u00fcrer]], [[Raphael]], [[Botticelli]], [[J\u00f6rg Breu the Elder]], [[Johannes Moreelse]], [[Artemisia Gentileschi]], [[Dami\u00e0 Campeny]], [[Eduardo Rosales]], [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], and others. Most commonly, either the moment of the rape is shown or Lucretia is shown alone at the moment of her suicide. In either situation, her clothing is loosened or absent, while Tarquin is normally clothed.\n\nThe subject was one of a group showing women from legend or the Bible who were either powerless or only able to escape their situations by suicide, such as [[Susanna (Book of Daniel)|Susanna]], [[Dido of Carthage]], and [[Verginia]].<ref>Russell, Nos 1\u201314</ref> These formed a counterpoint to, or sub-group of, the set of subjects known as the [[Power of Women]], showing female violence against, or domination of, men. These were often depicted by the same artists, and especially popular in [[Northern Renaissance]] art. The story of [[Esther]] lay somewhere between these two extremes.<ref>Russell, Nos 1, 15, 16</ref>\n\nThe subject of Lucretia spinning, with her ladies, is sometimes depicted, as in a series of four engravings of her story by [[Hendrick Goltzius]], which also includes a banquet.<ref>[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?searchText=1853,0312.230 British Museum], ''Story of Lucretia''.</ref>\n\n;Examples with articles\n\n*[[Tarquin and Lucretia]]\u2014 life-size image of the rape by [[Titian]]\n*[[The Story of Lucretia (Botticelli)]]\u2014three scenes, of the rape, Brutus arousing the people, and the suicide\n*[[The Suicide of Lucretia (D\u00fcrer)]]\u2014single figure painting\n*[[Lucretia and her Husband]]\u2014distinctive depiction of Lucretia with a knife, and a shadowy male figure just behind.

There are no contemporary sources; information regarding Lucretia, her rape and suicide, and the consequence of this being the start of the Roman Republic, come from the later accounts of Roman historian [[Livy]] and Greco-Roman historian [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]].\n\nThe incident kindled the flames of dissatisfaction over the tyrannical methods of the last king of Rome, [[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus]]. As a result, the prominent families instituted a republic, drove the extensive royal family of Tarquin from Rome, and successfully defended the republic against attempted [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] and [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latin]] intervention. The rape itself became a major theme in European art and literature.\n\nOne of the first two [[consul]]s of the Roman Republic, [[Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus]] was Lucretia's husband. All the numerous sources on the establishment of the republic reiterate the basic events of Lucretia's story, though accounts vary slightly. Lucretia's story is not considered a [[myth]] by most historians, but rather a historical [[legend]] about an early history that was already a major part of Roman [[folklore]] before it was first written about. The evidence points to the historical existence of a woman named Lucretia and a historical incident that played a critical part in the real downfall of a real monarchy. Many of the specific details, though, are debatable, and vary depending on the writer. Post-Roman uses of the legend typically became mythical in portrayal, being of artistic rather than historical merit.\n\nAs the events of the story move rapidly, the date of the incident is probably the same year as the first of the ''[[fasti]]''. Dionysius of Halicarnassus, a major source, sets this year \"at the beginning of the sixty-eighth [[Olympiad]] ... [[Isagoras]] being the annual [[archon]] at [[Athens]]\";<ref>D.H. V.1.</ref> that is, 508/507&nbsp;BC (the ancient calendars split years over modern ones). According to this source Lucretia therefore died in 508&nbsp;BC. The other historical sources tend to support this date, but the year is debatable within a range of about five years.<ref>{{cite book |first=Timothy J |last=Cornell |title=The Beginnings of Rome: Italy and Rome from the Bronze Age to the Punic Wars (c. 1000\u2013264&nbsp;BC) |series=The Routledge History of the Ancient World |chapter=9.

Prior to the rape, while her husband was an man of excellent social standing, he had no political power or standing in Rome. He lacked both the power and the wealth of his Tarquinius relatives. Her marriage was depicted as being the ideal Roman marriage as both Lucretia and Lucius were faithfully devoted to one another. She was described as beautiful and virtuous by Roman writer Livy. While her husband was away at battle, Lucretia would stay at home and pray for his safe return. Similar to Livy, [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus|Dionysius]]' depiction of Lucretia, separates her from the rest of Roman women in a story about the men returning home from a battle. The narrative begins with a bet between the sons of Tarquinius and their kinsmen, [[Lucius Junius Brutus|Brutus]] and [[Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus|Collantinus]]. The men fight over which of their wives best exemplified [[sophrosyne]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Mallan|first=C|date=2014|title=THE RAPE OF LUCRETIA IN CASSIUS DIO'S ROMAN HISTORY|url=|journal=The Classical Quarterly|edition=2|volume=64|pages=758-771|via=}}</ref> The men return home to find the women socializing with each other, presumably drinking and in conversation. In contrast, they find Lucretia home alone working with her wool in silence. Roman writers such as Livy, Ovid and Dionysus, described Lucretia as being the role model for Roman girls because of her devotion to her husband.'''<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Wiseman|first=T.P|date=1998|title=Roman Republic, Year One|url=|journal=Greece and Rome|edition=1|volume=45|pages=19-26|via=}}</ref>'''\n\n==Rape==\n[[File:Monogrammist I.W. - Lucretia (1525).jpg|thumb|''Lucrecia'', 1525, [[Monogrammist I.W.]] active in the [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Cranach]] studio c. 1520\u201340. The most common type of depiction.]]\n[[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus]], last king of Rome, being engaged in the siege of [[Ardea (RM)|Ardea]], sent his son, [[Sextus Tarquinius|Tarquin]], on a military errand to [[Collatia]]. Tarquin was received with great hospitality at the governor's mansion, home of [[Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus]], son of the king's nephew, [[Arruns Tarquinius (Egerius)|Arruns Tarquinius]], former governor of Collatia and first of the [[Tarquinius|Tarquinii Collatini]]. Collatinus' wife, Lucretia, daughter of [[Spurius Lucretius]], prefect of Rome, \"a man of distinction,\"<ref name=DHIV64>D.H. IV.64.</ref> made sure that the king's son was treated as became his rank, although her husband was away at the siege.\n\nIn a variant of the story,<ref>T.L. I.57.</ref> Tarquin and Collatinus, at a wine party on furlough, were debating the virtues of wives when Collatinus volunteered to settle the debate by all of them riding to his home to see what Lucretia was doing. She was weaving with her maids. The party awarded her the palm of victory and Collatinus invited them to visit, but for the time being they returned to camp.\n\nAt night, Tarquin entered her bedroom by stealth, quietly going around the slaves who were sleeping at her door. She awakened. He identified himself and offered her two choices: she could submit to his sexual advances and become his wife and future queen, or he would kill her and one of her slaves and place the bodies together, then claim he had caught her having adulterous sex (see [[sexuality in ancient Rome]] for Roman attitudes toward sex). In the alternative story, he returned from camp a few days later with one companion to take Collatinus up on his invitation to visit and was lodged in a guest bedroom. He entered Lucretia's room while she lay naked in her bed and started to wash her belly with water, which woke her up.\n\n==Consequences==\nTarquin returned to camp. The next day Lucretia dressed in black and went to her father's house in Rome and cast herself down in the supplicant's position (embracing the knees), weeping. Asked to explain herself, she insisted on first summoning witnesses and after disclosing the rape, called on them for vengeance, a plea that could not be ignored, as she was speaking to the chief magistrate of Rome. While they were debating the proper course of action, she drew a concealed dagger and stabbed herself in the heart. She died in her father's arms, with the women present [[keening]] and lamenting. \"This dreadful scene struck the Romans who were present with so much horror and compassion that they all cried out with one voice that they would rather die a thousand deaths in defence of their liberty than suffer such outrages to be committed by the tyrants.\"<ref>D.H. IV.66.</ref>\n\nIn the alternative version, she did not go to Rome, but sent for her father and her husband asking them to bring one friend each. Those selected were [[Publius Valerius Publicola]] from Rome and [[Lucius Junius Brutus]] from the camp at Ardea. They found Lucretia in her room. She explained what had happened and after exacting an oath of vengeance\u2014\"Pledge me your solemn word that the adulterer shall not go unpunished.\"\u2014<ref name=TLI58>T.L. I.58.</ref> and while they were discussing the matter, drew the poignard and stabbed herself in her heart.\n\nIn another version Collatinus and Brutus were encountered returning to Rome unaware, were briefed, and were brought to the death scene. Brutus happened to be a politically motivated participant. By kinship he was a Tarquin on his mother's side, the son of Tarquinia, daughter of [[Lucius Tarquinius Priscus]], the third king before last. He was a candidate for the throne if anything should happen to Superbus. By law, however, as he was a Junius on his father's side, he was not a Tarquin and therefore could later propose the exile of the Tarquins without fear for himself. Superbus had taken his inheritance and left him a pittance, keeping him at court for entertainment.<ref>D.H. IV.68.</ref>\n\n[[File:N03Brutus-u-Lucretia.jpg|thumb|left|The less common subject of [[Lucius Junius Brutus|Brutus]] holding the dead Lucretia and swearing the oath]]\nCollatinus, seeing his wife dead, became distraught. He held her, kissed her, called her name and spoke to her. Seeing the hand of Destiny in these events, his friend Brutus called the grieving party to order, explained that his simplicity had been a sham, and proposed that they drive the Tarquins from Rome. Grasping the bloody dagger,<ref>D.H. IV.70.</ref> he swore by Mars and all the other gods that he would do everything in his power to overthrow the dominion of the Tarquinii and that he would neither be reconciled to the tyrants himself nor tolerate any who should be reconciled to them, but would look upon every man who thought otherwise as an enemy and till his death would pursue with unrelenting hatred both the tyranny and its abettors; and if he should violate his oath, he prayed that he and his children might meet with the same end as Lucretia.\n\nHe passed the dagger around and each mourner swore the same oath by it. The two stories agree on this point: Livy's version is:<ref name=TLI59>T.L. I.59.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>By this blood\u2014most pure before the outrage wrought by the king's son\u2014I swear, and you, O gods, I call to witness that I will drive hence Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, together with his cursed wife and his whole blood, with fire and sword and every means in my power, and I will not suffer them or anyone else to reign in Rome.</blockquote>\n\n==Revolution==\n[[File:7031 Lucrecia romana.jpg|thumbnail|right|''Lucretia'' by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] ]]\n[[File:Gentileschi-Lucrezia-Potsdam.jpg|thumb|The rape, by [[Artemisia Gentileschi]]]]\n{{Main article|Overthrow of the Roman monarchy}}\nThe newly sworn revolutionary committee paraded the bloody corpse of Lucretia to the [[Roman Forum]] '''w'''here it remained on display as a reminder of the dishonor committed. At the form, the committee heard grievances against the Tarquins and began to enlist an army to abolish the monarchy. Brutus \"urged them to act as men and Romans and take up arms against their insolent foes.\"<ref name=TLI59/> The gates of Rome were blockaded by the new revolutionary soldiers and more were sent to guard Collatia. By now a crowd had gathered in the forum; the presence of the magistrates among the revolutionaries kept them in good order.\n\nBrutus was the Tribune of the Celeres, a minor office of some religious duties, which as a [[Magistrates' court|magistracy]] gave him the theoretical power to summon the [[curiae]], an organization of patrician families used mainly to ratify the decrees of the king. Summoning them on the spot he transformed the crowd into an authoritative legislative assembly and began to address them in one of the more noted and effective speeches of ancient Rome.\n\nHe began by revealing that his pose as fool was a sham designed to protect him against an evil king. He levelled a number of charges against the king and his family: the outrage against Lucretia, whom everyone could see on the dais, the king's tyranny, the forced labor of the [[plebeians]] in the ditches and sewers of Rome. In his speech, he pointed out that Superbus had come to rule by the murder of [[Servius Tullius]], his wife's father, next-to-the-last king of Rome. He \"solemnly invoked the gods as the avengers of murdered parents.\" He suggested that as the king's wife, [[Tullia (daughter of Servius Tullius)|Tullia]], was in fact in Rome and probably was a witness to the proceedings from her palace near the forum. Seeing herself the target of so much animosity she fled from the palace in fear of her life and proceeded to the camp at Ardea.<ref name=TLI59/>\n\nBrutus opened a debate on the form of government Rome ought to have, a debate at which many [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]] spoke. In summation he proposed the banishment of the Tarquins from all the territories of Rome and appointment of an [[interrex]] to nominate new magistrates and conduct an election of ratification. They decided on a republican form of government with two consuls in place of a king executing the will of a patrician senate. This was a temporary measure until they could consider the details more carefully. Brutus renounced all right to the throne. In subsequent years the powers of the king were divided among various elected magistracies.\n\nA final vote of the curiae carried the interim constitution. Spurius Lucretius was swiftly elected interrex; he was prefect of the city already. He proposed Brutus and Collatinus as the first two consuls and that choice was ratified by the curiae. Needing to acquire the assent of the population as a whole, they paraded Lucretia through the streets summoning the plebeians to legal assembly in the forum. Once there they heard a constitutional speech by Brutus not unlike many speeches and documents of western civilization subsequently. It began:<ref>D.H. IV.78.</ref>\n\n{{quote|In as much as Tarquinius neither obtained the sovereignty in accordance with our ancestral customs and laws, nor, since he obtained it\u2014in whatever manner he got it\u2014has he been exercising it in an honourable or kingly manner, but has surpassed in insolence and lawlessness all the tyrants the world ever saw, we patricians met together and resolved to deprive him of his power, a thing we ought to have done long ago, but are doing now when a favourable opportunity has offered. And we have called you together, plebeians, in order to declare our own decision and then ask for your assistance in achieving liberty for our country ....}}\n\nA general election was held and the vote won in favor of the republic. This ended the monarchy, and during these proceedings Lucretia was still displayed in the forum.\n\nThe constitutional consequences of this event were, prevented Rome from having another hereditary \"king,\" [[Roman Empire|later emperors]] were absolute rulers in all but name. This constitutional tradition prevented both [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Octavian Augustus]] from accepting a crown; instead they had to devise a confluence of several [[Roman Republic|republican offices]] onto their persons in order to secure absolute power. Their [[Roman emperor|successors]] both in [[Western Roman Empire|Rome]] and in [[Byzantine Emperor|Constantinople]] adhered to this tradition in form if not in essence, and the office of German [[Holy Roman Emperor]] remained elective rather than hereditary\u2014up to its abolition in the [[Napoleonic Wars]], over 2300 years later.[[File:Sandro Botticelli 078.jpg|thumb|Detail of ''[[The Story of Lucretia (Botticelli)|The Story of Lucretia]]'' ({{circa|1500\u201301}}), by [[Sandro Botticelli]].

In his account her husband has boasted of the virtue of his wife to Tarquin and others. Livy contrasts the virtue of the Roman Lucretia, who remained in her room weaving, with the Etruscan ladies who feasted with friends. Ovid recounts the story of Lucretia in Book II of his ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'', published in 8 AD, concentrating on the bold over-reaching character of Tarquin. Later, [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] made use of the figure of Lucretia in ''[[The City of God]]'' (published 426 AD) to defend the honour of Christian women who had been raped in the sack of Rome and had not committed suicide.\n\nThe story of Lucretia was a popular moral tale in the later Middle Ages.  Lucretia appears to [[Dante]] in the section of Limbo reserved to the nobles of Rome and other \"virtuous pagans\" in Canto IV of the [[Inferno (Dante)|''Inferno'']]. [[Christine de Pizan]] used Lucretia just as St. Augustine of Hippo did in her ''City of Ladies'', defending a woman's sanctity.\n\nThe myth is recounted in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Legend of Good Women]]'', and it follows a similar story line to Livy's. Lucretia calls for her father and husband, but Chaucer's tale also has her call for her mother and attendants as well, whereas Livy's has both her father and husband bring an friend as witness. The tale also deviated from Livy's account as it begins with her husband coming home to surprise her, rather than the men placing an bet on the virtue of their wives. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/English/GoodWomen.php#anchor_Toc186791816|title=The Legend of Good Women|last=Chaucer|first=Geoffery|date=2008|website=Poetry in Translation|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n[[John Gower]]'s ''[[Confessio Amantis]]'' (Book VII)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://d.lib.rochester.edu/teams/text/peck-gower-confessio-amantis-book-7|title=Confessio Amantis|last=Gower|first=John|date=2004|website=Rochester|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>,and [[John Lydgate]]'s ''[[Fall of Princes]] recount the myth of Lucretia''.

Shakespeare's poem, based off the rape of Lucretia, draws on the beginning of the Livy's account of the incident. The poem begins with a bet between husbands about the virtuousness of their wives. Shakespeare draws on the idea of Lucretia as a moral agent, as Livy did, when he explores his characters response to death and her unwillingness to yield to her rapist. A direct excerpt from Livy is used when Shakespeare prefaces his poem with a brief prose called \"Argument\". This is the internal deliberation Lucrece suffered from, following the rape. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Metzger|first=Mary Janell|date=2016|title=Epistemic Injustice and the Rape of Lucrece|url=|journal=Mosaic : A Journal for the Interdisciplinary Study of Literature|edition=2|volume=49|pages=19-34|via=}}</ref>\n\nNiccol\u00f2 Machiavelli's comedy [[The Mandrake|''La Mandragola'']] is loosely based on the Lucretia story.\n\nShe is also mentioned in the poem \"[[Appius and Virginia]]\" by [[John Webster]] and [[Thomas Heywood]], which includes the following lines:\n\n{{quote|<poem>Two fair, but ladies most infortunate,\nHave in their ruins rais'd declining Rome,\nLucretia and [[Verginia|Virginia]], both renown'd\nFor chastity.<ref>John Webster ''[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=w_5ADgAAQBAJ&pg=PT171&lpg=PT171&dq=%22ladies+most+infortunate%22&source=bl&ots=b14T7Zh4hk&sig=TNFhQWg5Lte4Lr8O-yyNjfsBRy0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjmi87Zu4zaAhUHmrQKHYJzDvQQ6AEIMTAC Appius and Virginia]'' 5.3.224</ref></poem>}}\n\n[[Thomas Heywood]]'s play ''The Rape of Lucretia'' dates from 1607. The subject also enjoyed a revival in the mid twentieth century; [[Andr\u00e9 Obey]]'s 1931 play ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Le Viol de Lucr\u00e8ce|fr}}'' was adapted by librettist [[Ronald Duncan]] for ''[[The Rape of Lucretia]]'', a 1946 opera by [[Benjamin Britten]] which premiered at Glyndebourne. [[Ernst Krenek]] set [[Emmet Lavery]]'s [[libretto]] ''[[Tarquin (opera)|Tarquin]]'' (1940), a version in a contemporary setting.\n\n[[Jacques Gallot]] (died {{circa|1690}}) composed the allemandes \"[[Lucr\u00e8ce]]\" and \"[[Tarquin (Gallot)|Tarquin]]\" for baroque lute.\n\nIn [[Samuel Richardson]]'s 1740 novel ''[[Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded|Pamela]]'', Mr. B. cites the story of Lucretia as a reason why Pamela ought not fear for her reputation, should he rape her. Pamela quickly sets him straight with a better reading of the story. Colonial Mexican poet [[Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz]] also mentions Lucrecia in her poem \"Redondillas,\" a commentary on prostitution and who is to blame.\n\nIn 1769, doctor [[Joan Ramis]] wrote a tragedy in [[Menorca]] entitled ''Lucrecia''. The play is written in the [[Catalan language]] using a neoclassical style and is the most important work of the eighteenth century written in this language.\n\nIn 1932, the play ''Lucrece'' was produced on Broadway starring legendary actress [[Katharine Cornell]] in the title part. It was mostly performed in [[pantomime]].\n\nIn [[Donna Leon]]'s 2009 Venetian novel, ''About Face'', Franca Marinello refers to the tale of Tarquin and Lucrezia, as recounted in [[Ovid]]'s '' Fasti '' (Book II, for February 24, \"Regifugium\") to explain her actions to Commissario Brunetti.\n\n==Subject in art==\nSince the Renaissance, the suicide of Lucretia has been an enduring subject for visual artists, including [[Titian]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer|D\u00fcrer]], [[Raphael]], [[Botticelli]], [[J\u00f6rg Breu the Elder]], [[Johannes Moreelse]], [[Artemisia Gentileschi]], [[Dami\u00e0 Campeny]], [[Eduardo Rosales]], [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], and others. Most commonly, either the moment of the rape is shown or Lucretia is shown alone at the moment of her suicide. In either situation, her clothing is loosened or absent, while Tarquin is normally clothed.\n\nThe subject was one of a group showing women from legend or the Bible who were either powerless or only able to escape their situations by suicide, such as [[Susanna (Book of Daniel)|Susanna]], [[Dido of Carthage]], and [[Verginia]].<ref>Russell, Nos 1\u201314</ref> These formed a counterpoint to, or sub-group of, the set of subjects known as the [[Power of Women]], showing female violence against, or domination of, men. These were often depicted by the same artists, and especially popular in [[Northern Renaissance]] art. The story of [[Esther]] lay somewhere between these two extremes.<ref>Russell, Nos 1, 15, 16</ref>\n\nThe subject of Lucretia spinning, with her ladies, is sometimes depicted, as in a series of four engravings of her story by [[Hendrick Goltzius]], which also includes a banquet.<ref>[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?searchText=1853,0312.230 British Museum], ''Story of Lucretia''.</ref>\n\n;Examples with articles\n\n*[[Tarquin and Lucretia]]\u2014 life-size image of the rape by [[Titian]]\n*[[The Story of Lucretia (Botticelli)]]\u2014three scenes, of the rape, Brutus arousing the people, and the suicide\n*[[The Suicide of Lucretia (D\u00fcrer)]]\u2014single figure painting\n*[[Lucretia and her Husband]]\u2014distinctive depiction of Lucretia with a knife, and a shadowy male figure just behind.

It was launched in October 2007 by Barnes & Noble CEO Steve Riggio and [[James Mustich, Jr.]], publisher of the book catalog [[A Common Reader]]. Regular contributors to the magazine have included book critics [[Michael Dirda]], Brooke Allen, Laura Miller, and [[Adam Kirsch]], as well as prominent writers in fields outside of literary criticism, such as political journalists [[Chris Hayes]] and [[Ezra Klein]], philosopher [[A.\u2009C. Grayling]], music critic [[Robert Christgau]], and cartoonist [[Ward Sutton]]. Miller, who has written for ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' and Mustich's Common Reader, said, \"The reviews [at ''BNR''] are the same as anywhere else\", adding that the tone and length of the pieces evoke ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' rather than the less formal ''Salon''. The magazine's [[web traffic]] flourished during its first few years. According to [[Compete.com]], it amassed 50,000 [[unique user|unique visitors]] in December 2009.<ref name=\"CJR\">{{cite magazine|last=Smith|first=Jordan Michael|date=April 2010|url=https://archives.cjr.org/review/critical_condition.php|title=Critical Condition|magazine=[[Columbia Journalism Review]]|accessdate=June 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\nSome critics were originally skeptical of ''The Barnes & Noble Review''. Art Winslow, former literary editor of ''[[The Nation]]'', said that because Barnes & Noble is a [[brand name]], ''BNR''{{'}}s contributors are effectively endorsing the corporation, and that the motives behind the publication undermine its integrity: \"Criticism's content should be free of any commercialism. Barnes & Noble has found another way to sell books, and that's the ''Review''. ... I wouldn't write there.\" Mustich disputed the idea that the magazine serves as a corporate tactic: \"We counter that skepticism with quality. If people read the site, they can determine that we are doing what we purport to do. They have never tried to influence my judgment. The first attempt would have been the last.\"<ref name=\"CJR\"/>\n\n==Barnes & Noble Nook==\n{{See also|Barnes & Noble Nook}}\nBarnes & Noble Nook (styled NOOK) is a suite of [[e-book]] readers developed by the company,<ref>{{cite news|author=Jeffrey A.

The field of players is smaller than those of the other major championships because it is an invitational event, held by the Augusta National Golf Club.\n\nThe tournament has a number of traditions. Since [[1949 Masters Tournament|1949]], a green jacket has been awarded to the champion, who must return it to the clubhouse one year after his victory, although it remains his personal property and is stored with other champions' jackets in a specially designated cloakroom. In most instances, only a first-time and currently reigning champion may remove his jacket from the club grounds. A golfer who wins the event multiple times uses the same green jacket awarded upon his initial win (unless he needs to be re-fitted with a new jacket).<ref>{{cite web |first=Brent |last=Kelley |title=Do Masters Champions Get to Keep the Green Jacket? |url=http://golf.about.com/od/majorchampionships/f/keep_jacket.htm |publisher=About.com}}</ref> The Champions Dinner, inaugurated by [[Ben Hogan]] in [[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], is held on the Tuesday before each tournament, and is open only to past champions and certain board members of the Augusta National Golf Club. Beginning in [[1963 Masters Tournament|1963]], legendary golfers, usually past champions, have hit an honorary tee shot on the morning of the first round to commence play. These have included [[Fred McLeod]], [[Jock Hutchinson]], [[Gene Sarazen]], [[Sam Snead]], [[Byron Nelson]], [[Arnold Palmer]], [[Jack Nicklaus]], and [[Gary Player]]. Since [[1960 Masters Tournament|1960]], a [[Masters Tournament Par-3 contest|semi-social contest]] at the par-3 course has been played on Wednesday, the day before the first round.\n\nNicklaus has the most Masters wins, with six between 1963 and 1986. [[Tiger Woods]] has won five. Palmer has won four. Five have won three titles at Augusta: [[Jimmy Demaret]], [[Sam Snead]], [[Gary Player]], [[Nick Faldo]], and [[Phil Mickelson]]. Player, from [[South Africa]], was the first non-American player to win the tournament, in [[1961 Masters Tournament|1961]]; the second was [[Seve Ballesteros]] of [[Spain]], the champion in [[1980 Masters Tournament|1980]] and [[1983 Masters Tournament|1983]].\n\nThe Augusta National course first opened {{Years or months ago|1933}} in 1933 and has been modified many times by different architects. Among the changes: greens have been reshaped and, on occasion, entirely re-designed, bunkers have been added, water hazards have been extended, new tee boxes have been built, hundreds of trees have been planted, and several mounds have been installed.<ref name=\"Owen 1999\">{{cite book |title=The Making of the Masters: Clifford Roberts, Augusta National, and Golf's Most Prestigious Tournament |first=David |last=Owen |publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-684-85729-9}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:AugustaNationalMastersLogoFlowers.jpg|thumb|<center>Masters logo<br>at the club entrance</center>]]\n\n===Augusta National Golf Club===\n{{main|Augusta National Golf Club}}\nThe idea for Augusta National originated with [[Bobby Jones (golfer)|Bobby Jones]], who wanted to build a golf course after his retirement from the game.

The green sport coat is the official attire worn by members of Augusta National while on the club grounds; each Masters winner becomes an honorary member of the club. The recipient of the green jacket has it presented to him inside the Butler Cabin soon after the end of the tournament in a televised ceremony, and the presentation is then repeated outside near the 18th green in front of the patrons. Winners keep their jacket for the year after their victory, then return it to the club to wear whenever they are present on the club grounds. [[Sam Snead]] was the first Masters champion to be awarded the green jacket after he took his first Masters title in 1949.\n\nThe green jacket is only allowed to be removed from the Augusta National grounds by the reigning champion, after which it must remain at the club.

In 1997, 1979 champion [[Fuzzy Zoeller]] created a media storm when he suggested that Tiger Woods refrain from serving collard greens and fried chicken, dishes commonly associated with Afro-American culture, at the dinner.

Since [[1948 Masters Tournament|1948]], its final round has been scheduled for the second Sunday of April, with several exceptions. It ended on the first Sunday four times ([[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], [[1958 Masters Tournament|1958]], [[1959 Masters Tournament|1959]]) and the [[1979 Masters Tournament|1979]] and [[1984 Masters Tournament|1984]] tournaments ended on April 15, the month's third Sunday.<ref name=\"Hist\"/> The first edition in [[1934 Masters Tournament|1934]] was held in late March and the next ten were in early April, with only the [[1942 Masters Tournament|1942]] event scheduled to end on the second Sunday.  The [[2020 Masters Tournament|2020]] event, postponed by the [[COVID-19]] pandemic, is slated to be held in the autumn, with it being the last major of the year.\n\nSimilar to the other majors, the tournament consists of four rounds at 18 holes each, Thursday through Sunday (when there are no delays). The Masters has a relatively small field of contenders, when compared with other golf tournaments, so the competitors play in groups of three for the first two rounds (36 holes) and the field is not split to start on the 1st and 10th tees, unless weather shortens the available playing time, such as the second round in 1983, fourth round in 2019, and is expected for all four rounds in 2020. The tournament is unique in that it is the only major tournament conducted by a private club rather than a national golf organization like the PGA.<ref name=\"Owen 1999\" />\n\nOriginally, the Masters was the only tournament to use two-man pairings during the first two rounds. It was also the only event to re-pair based on the leaderboard before Friday's round, as most tournaments only do this on the weekend. This practice ended in the early 2000s, when the Masters switched to the more standard three-man groups and the groups are now kept intact on Friday, with players sharing the same playing partners in both of the first two rounds.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nAfter 36 holes of play, a cut-off score is calculated to reduce the size of the field for the weekend rounds. To \"make the cut\", players must be either in the top 50 places (ties counting), or within 10 strokes of the leader's score. These criteria have applied since [[2013 Masters Tournament|2013]].<ref name=cut>{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/masters13/story/_/id/9156060/fall-tour-event-winners-get-masters-spot |title=Masters tweaks qualifications |first=Bob |last=Harig |work=ESPN |date=April 10, 2013 |access-date=April 16, 2013}}</ref> From 1957 to 1960, the top 40 scores (including ties) and those within 10 strokes of the leader made the cut. From 1961 to 2012, it was the top 44 (and ties) or within 10 strokes of the lead.<ref name=cut/> Before [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], there was no 36-hole cut and all of the invitees played four rounds, if desired.<ref name=\"Cut\">{{cite web |url=http://www.masters.org/en_US/history/records/cutinfo.html |title=Cut Information |publisher=www.masters.org |access-date=January 21, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119025225/http://www.masters.org/en_US/history/records/cutinfo.html |archivedate=January 19, 2008}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the cut, an additional 36 holes are played over the final two days. Should the fourth round fail to produce a winner, all players tied for the lead enter a [[Sudden death (sport)#Golf|sudden-death]] playoff. Play begins on the 18th hole, followed by the adjacent 10th, repeating until one player remains.

[[Tiger Woods]] has won five. Palmer has won four. Five have won three titles at Augusta: [[Jimmy Demaret]], [[Sam Snead]], [[Gary Player]], [[Nick Faldo]], and [[Phil Mickelson]].

The event was established as part of an effort to help promote the sport of golf among youth; the winners of local qualifiers in different age groups advance to the national finals, which have been held at Augusta National on the Sunday immediately preceding the Masters. The driving and chipping portions of the event are held on the course's practice range, but the putting portion has been played on the course's 18th hole.<ref>{{Cite magazine |url=https://www.golfdigest.com/story/inaugural-drive-chip-and-putt |title=Inaugural Drive, Chip and Putt Championship has juniors living Augusta National dreams |last=Hennessey |first=Stephen |magazine=Golf Digest |date=April 4, 2014 |access-date=2018-04-08 |df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/2013/04/08/masters-augusta-national-drive-chip-and-putt-contest/2064565/ |title=Masters unveils drive, chip and putt contest |newspaper=USA Today |agency=Associated Press |date=April 8, 2013 |access-date=2018-04-08 |df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.espn.com/golf/story/_/id/22996264/drive-chip-putt-winners-crowned-augusta-national-ahead-masters |title=Drive, Chip & Putt winners crowned at Augusta |work=ESPN |first=Bob |last=Harig |date=Apr 1, 2018 |access-date=2018-04-08 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nOn April 4, 2018, prior to the 2018 tournament, new Augusta National chairman [[Fred Ridley]] announced that the club would host the [[Augusta National Women's Amateur]] beginning in 2019. The first two rounds will be held at the Champion's Retreat club in [[Evans, Georgia]], with the final two rounds hosted by Augusta National (the final round will take place on the Saturday directly preceding the tournament). Ridley stated that holding such an event at Augusta National would have the \"greatest impact\" on women's golf. Although concerns were raised that the event would conflict with the [[LPGA Tour]]'s [[ANA Inspiration]] (which has invited top amateur players to compete), Ridley stated that he had discussed the event with commissioner [[Mike Whan]], and stated that he agreed on the notion that any move to bolster the prominence of women's golf would be a \"win\" for the LPGA over time.

It invites winners of the most prestigious amateur tournaments in the world. Also, the current [[U.S. Amateur]] champion always plays in the same group as the defending Masters champion for the first two days of the tournament.\n\nAmateurs in the field are welcome to stay in the \"Crow's Nest\" atop the Augusta National clubhouse during the tournament. The Crow's Nest is {{convert|1200|sqft|-1}} with lodging space for five during the competition.\n\n===Opening tee shot===\nSince 1963, the custom in most years has been to start the tournament with an honorary opening tee shot at the first hole, typically by one or more legendary players. The original honorary starters were [[Jock Hutchison]] and [[Fred McLeod]]; this twosome led off every tournament from 1963 until 1973, when poor health prevented Hutchison from swinging a club. McLeod continued on until his death in 1976. Byron Nelson and Gene Sarazen started in 1981, and were then joined by Sam Snead in 1984. This trio continued until 1999 when Sarazen died, while Nelson stopped in 2001. Snead hit his final opening tee shot in 2002, a little over a month before he died.\n\nIn 2007, Arnold Palmer took over as the honorary starter.

Officially known as the \"Masters Club\", it includes only past winners of the Masters, although selected members of the Augusta National Golf Club have been included as honorary members, usually the chairman.\n\nThe defending champion, as host, selects the menu for the dinner. Frequently, Masters champions have served cuisine from their home regions prepared by the Masters chef. Notable examples have included [[haggis]], served by [[Scotland|Scotsman]] [[Sandy Lyle]] in 1989,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.masters.org/en_US/course/landmarks.html#dinner |title=Masters Club |publisher=www.masters.org |accessdate=January 25, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109192302/http://www.masters.org/en_US/course/landmarks.html |archivedate=January 9, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and [[bobotie]], a South African dish, served at the behest of 2008 champion [[Trevor Immelman]]. Other examples include German Bernhard Langer's 1986 Wiener schnitzel, Britain's Nick Faldo's fish and chips, Canadian Mike Weir's elk and wild boar, and Vijay Singh's seafood tom kah and chicken panang curry. In 1997, 1979 champion [[Fuzzy Zoeller]] created a media storm when he suggested that Tiger Woods refrain from serving collard greens and fried chicken, dishes commonly associated with Afro-American culture, at the dinner. The 2011 dinner of [[Phil Mickelson]] was a Spanish-themed menu in hopes that [[Seve Ballesteros]] would attend, but he was too sick to attend and died  weeks later.<ref>[http://www.golf.com/tour-news/2017/03/15/masters-champions-dinner-everything-you-need-know Masters Champions Dinner: Everything you need to know]</ref>\n\n===Caddies===\nUntil [[1983 Masters Tournament|1983]], all players in the Masters were required to use the services of an Augusta National Club [[caddie]],<ref name=trcdatag>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WFcaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=yiQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6177%2C1789683 |newspaper=Times-News |location=Hendersonville, North Carolina |title=Tour caddies at Augusta? |date=November 12, 1982 |page=14}}</ref><ref name=alctrbgd>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3LUSAAAAIBAJ&sjid=mvkDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6774%2C1068214 |newspaper=Spokane Chronicle |location=Washington |last=Wade |first=Harless |title=Tradition bagged at Masters |date=April 6, 1983 |page=C1}}</ref><ref name=mcadcol>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xMksAAAAIBAJ&sjid=chMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6823%2C3348928 |newspaper=Sunday Star-News |location=Wilmington, North Carolina |last=Anderson |first=Dave |authorlink=Dave Anderson (sportswriter) |title=New Masters caddies collide |date=April 10, 1983 |page=6D}}</ref> who by club tradition was always an African American man.<ref name=\"nyt1990\"/> Indeed, club co-founder Clifford Roberts is reputed to have said, \"As long as I'm alive, golfers will be white, and caddies will be black.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Rick |last=Reilly |authorlink=Rick Reilly |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1997/04/21/225867/strokes-of-genius-overpowering-a-storied-course-and-a-stellar-field-tiger-woods-heralded-a-new-era-in-golf-with-an-awesome-12-shot-victory-in-the-masters |title=Strokes of Genius |date=April 21, 1997 |accessdate=February 9, 2016 |magazine=Sports Illustrated}}</ref> Since 1983\u2014six years after Roberts's death in 1977\u2014players have been allowed the option of bringing their own caddie to the tournament.\n\nThe Masters requires caddies to wear a uniform consisting of a white jumpsuit, a green Masters cap, and white tennis shoes.

Since [[1948 Masters Tournament|1948]], its final round has been scheduled for the second Sunday of April, with several exceptions. It ended on the first Sunday four times ([[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], [[1958 Masters Tournament|1958]], [[1959 Masters Tournament|1959]]) and the [[1979 Masters Tournament|1979]] and [[1984 Masters Tournament|1984]] tournaments ended on April 15, the month's third Sunday.<ref name=\"Hist\"/> The first edition in [[1934 Masters Tournament|1934]] was held in late March and the next ten were in early April, with only the [[1942 Masters Tournament|1942]] event scheduled to end on the second Sunday.  The [[2020 Masters Tournament|2020]] event, postponed by the [[COVID-19]] pandemic, is slated to be held in the autumn, with it being the last major of the year.\n\nSimilar to the other majors, the tournament consists of four rounds at 18 holes each, Thursday through Sunday (when there are no delays). The Masters has a relatively small field of contenders, when compared with other golf tournaments, so the competitors play in groups of three for the first two rounds (36 holes) and the field is not split to start on the 1st and 10th tees, unless weather shortens the available playing time, such as the second round in 1983, fourth round in 2019, and is expected for all four rounds in 2020. The tournament is unique in that it is the only major tournament conducted by a private club rather than a national golf organization like the PGA.<ref name=\"Owen 1999\" />\n\nOriginally, the Masters was the only tournament to use two-man pairings during the first two rounds. It was also the only event to re-pair based on the leaderboard before Friday's round, as most tournaments only do this on the weekend. This practice ended in the early 2000s, when the Masters switched to the more standard three-man groups and the groups are now kept intact on Friday, with players sharing the same playing partners in both of the first two rounds.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nAfter 36 holes of play, a cut-off score is calculated to reduce the size of the field for the weekend rounds. To \"make the cut\", players must be either in the top 50 places (ties counting), or within 10 strokes of the leader's score. These criteria have applied since [[2013 Masters Tournament|2013]].<ref name=cut>{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/masters13/story/_/id/9156060/fall-tour-event-winners-get-masters-spot |title=Masters tweaks qualifications |first=Bob |last=Harig |work=ESPN |date=April 10, 2013 |access-date=April 16, 2013}}</ref> From 1957 to 1960, the top 40 scores (including ties) and those within 10 strokes of the leader made the cut.

presenting an award, known as the Silver Cup, to the lowest-scoring amateur to make the cut. In 1954 they began presenting an amateur silver medal to the low amateur runner-up. There have been six players to win low amateur and then go on to win the Masters as a professional. These players are [[Cary Middlecoff]], [[Jack Nicklaus]], [[Ben Crenshaw]], [[Phil Mickelson]], [[Tiger Woods]] and [[Sergio Garc\u00eda]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable

RTX is also notable for being one of the first places consumers may play major video game releases such as ''[[Halo 4]]'' and most recently, ''[[Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege|Rainbow Six: Siege]]''.\n\n==History==\nRTX was announced February 16, 2011 and the inaugural event was meant to be for 200 people.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sorola|first1=Gus|title=ROOSTER TEETH PODCAST: ROOSTER TEETH PODCAST #101 - Rooster Teeth is joined by Matt|url=http://roosterteeth.com/episode/rt-podcast-season-1-rooster-teeth-podcast-101|website=RoosterTeeth|publisher=RoosterTeeth|accessdate=November 20, 2016}}</ref> However, minutes after tickets went on sale the community managed to buy more tickets than originally planned to be sold, accidentally selling over 500 tickets.\n\n===RTX 2011===\n[[File:Jack Pattillo giving a Rooster Teeth office tour (5791115172).jpg|thumb|left|[[Achievement Hunter]] host Jack Pattillo guides RTX 2011 attendees on a tour of the Rooster Teeth offices.]]\nRTX 2011 was the first official convention for Rooster Teeth fans.

The convention was deemed a success, and RTX became an annual event.\n\n===RTX 2012===\nAfter the success of RTX 2011, RTX 2012 expanded significantly with 4,500 attendees. RTX 2012 was held from July 7\u20138 at the [[Austin Convention Center]], and was treated as more of a traditional gaming convention, introducing features such as an exhibit hall which included exhibitor booths from gaming and internet personalities and companies, various panels, and the first publicly playable demo of ''Halo 4''. [[343 Industries]] also showed off forge in ''Halo 4'' for the first time. Similarly to the previous year, RTX attendees had the chance to take part as extras in the upcoming Rooster Teeth series ''Day Five''.\n\n===RTX 2013===\n[[File:Gus Sorola and Gavin Free at RTX 2013.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gavin Free]] and [[Gus Sorola]] co-hosting a panel for the ''[[Rooster Teeth Podcast]]'' at RTX 2013]]\n[[File:Gaming at RTX 2013 (9362002746).jpg|thumb|right|Competitive gaming in front of a crowd at RTX 2013]]\nRTX 2013 was held from July 5\u20137 at the Austin Convention Center, once again with significant expansion with over 10,000 attendees.

The Rooster Teeth series ''[[RWBY]]'' made its premiere. [[Ubisoft]] brought a publicly playable demo of ''[[Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag]]''. Attendees also had the opportunity to use the [[Oculus Rift]] virtual reality device, try out for Rooster Teeth's gaming competition series ''The Gauntlet'', and take part in an episode of ''[[The Slow Mo Guys]]'', as well as many other activities. The YouTube gaming group known as [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6JmDMC2x3vafwH5QRB1khA The Creatures] also made an appearance, and made several important announcements involving their recent work, a new member to their group and the face reveal of [https://www.youtube.com/user/TheCampingTree Sp00n], who up until this point, had never revealed his face.\n\n===RTX 2014===\nRTX 2014 was held from July 4\u20136 at the Austin Convention Center.

[[343 Industries]] also showed off forge in ''Halo 4'' for the first time.

Attendees also had the opportunity to use the [[Oculus Rift]] virtual reality device, try out for Rooster Teeth's gaming competition series ''The Gauntlet'', and take part in an episode of ''[[The Slow Mo Guys]]'', as well as many other activities. The YouTube gaming group known as [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6JmDMC2x3vafwH5QRB1khA The Creatures] also made an appearance, and made several important announcements involving their recent work, a new member to their group and the face reveal of [https://www.youtube.com/user/TheCampingTree Sp00n], who up until this point, had never revealed his face.\n\n===RTX 2014===\nRTX 2014 was held from July 4\u20136 at the Austin Convention Center.
