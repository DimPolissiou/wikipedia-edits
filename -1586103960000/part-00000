Some GlcA residues are [[epimer]]ized into [[iduronic acid|L-iduronic acid]] (IdoA); the resulting [[disaccharide]] is then referred to as [[dermatan sulfate]].\n\nChondroitin sulfate chains are linked to hydroxyl groups on [[serine]] residues of certain proteins. Exactly how proteins are selected for attachment of glycosaminoglycans is not understood.  Glycosylated serines are often followed by a glycine and have neighboring acidic residues, but this motif does not always predict glycosylation.\n\nAttachment of the GAG chain begins with four monosaccharides in a fixed pattern: [[Xylose|Xyl]] - [[Galactose|Gal]] - Gal - GlcA.  Each sugar is attached by a specific enzyme, allowing for multiple levels of control over GAG synthesis. Xylose begins to be attached to proteins in the [[endoplasmic reticulum]], while the rest of the sugars are attached in the [[Golgi apparatus]].<ref name=Silbert_2002>{{cite journal |vauthors=Silbert JE, Sugumaran G | title=Biosynthesis of chondroitin/dermatan sulfate | journal=IUBMB Life | year=2002 | volume=54 | issue=4 | pages= 177\u201386| pmid=12512856 | doi= 10.1080/15216540214923}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nChondroitin sulfate was originally isolated well before the structure was characterised, leading to changes in terminology with time.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=P.

The FDA denied the request, stating that experiments conducted by the company did not sufficiently demonstrate the effectiveness of the claim.  Among other comments, the FDA noted the poor experimental design of some trials.<ref name=\"FDACS\"/>\n\nIn 2007, Reichenbach et al. used explicit methods to conduct and report a systematic review of 20 trials and concluded \"large-scale, methodologically sound trials indicate that the symptomatic benefit of chondroitin is minimal or nonexistent.

Season two was broadcast on Saturday nights from July 27, 1996 and fared similarly well, but was pulled from the schedules in October with five episodes of the season remaining. These were shown in January 1997. The BBC co-financed the third season but struggled to find a suitable slot on Saturday nights for it, and only five episodes of the series were shown in May and June 1998 with the remainder in daytime slots over Christmas 1998. The final season, broadcast from May to November 1999, was moved to [[BBC Two]] and consistently performed well, with ratings of over two million viewers, regularly appearing in the top-ten weekly shows for the channel. Upon the end of the series in 1999, BBC Two immediately began to screen repeats, and the series was also rescreened on [[ITV3]] in 2006, and again on BBC Two from October 18, 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00vk2fz/episodes/2010 |title=Two Programmes - Due South - Episodes from 2010 |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2011-03-02}}</ref> A rerun on digital channel [[True Entertainment]] began on October 10, 2014 with the pilot, with regular-series episodes following on weekdays from October 13.\n\n==Story overview==\n{{main|List of Due South episodes}}\n\nThe premise of the series centres on a [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP) [[constable]] named [[Benton Fraser]] ([[Paul Gross]]) who travels to [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] to solve the murder of his father; this is how he meets his soon-to-be partner, [[Raymond Vecchio|Ray Vecchio]] ([[David Marciano]]), a tough, streetwise cop. Accompanied by his deaf lip-reading half-wolf Diefenbaker (whom Fraser adopted after Diefenbaker saved his life), the investigation leads Fraser to uncover a plot by a company building a dam that is slowly killing the environment. This leads to the dam being shut down and many people losing their jobs. He also implicates corrupt members of the RCMP in the affair. This along with the loss of so many peoples' jobs makes him [[persona non grata]] in Canada, and he finds himself stationed in Chicago. This plot line is referred to repeatedly during the series, and from season three on he introduces himself to many by saying:\n\n<blockquote>I first came to Chicago on the trail of the killers of my father and, for reasons which don't need exploring at this juncture, I have remained, attached as liaison to the Canadian consulate.</blockquote>\n\nMarciano, the original Ray, left the series after the second season; however, he appeared in the first and last of the post-1997 episodes. His replacement was [[Callum Keith Rennie]] as [[Stanley Kowalski (Due South)|Stanley Raymond Kowalski]], a detective who was under orders to impersonate Vecchio while the real Vecchio was undercover. Marciano did return for the series finale, in which Vecchio returned to Chicago to break up a weapons-smuggling ring, and eventually ran off to Florida with Kowalski's ex-wife, Stella. Also in that episode, Benton and his father's ghost finally solve Benton's mother's murder, resulting in Fraser Sr.'s departure to rejoin his wife. The series ends with Benton and Kowalski in search of the graves of the [[Franklin expedition]], immortalized in the Canadian folk song \"[[Northwest Passage (song)|Northwest Passage]]\", which Paul Gross sings in the episode.\n\n===Recurring themes===\n{{original research|date=May 2016}}\nBenton Fraser is the archetypal Mountie: dogged, polite, and compulsively truthful. The series often featured his rigid moral code being tested by the cynical realities of Chicago life. Being overly polite, Fraser's best known short quotes were \"thank you kindly\"; when he found himself in trouble, an understated \"oh dear\"; and, when faced with contradictory circumstances from other characters, an all-knowing and eloquently stated \"understood\". More unusual is his encyclopedic knowledge of trivia (attributed to his grandparents having been librarians) and a range of uncanny abilities. These include his ability to sniff and lick refuse from the streets to gain clues about crimes, the way he can fall into a dumpster or other waste heap and emerge completely spotless and unwrinkled, and the way many women he encounters fall madly in love with him, including his boss Margaret (Meg) Thatcher and Ray's sister Francesca. The fact that he rarely pursues any of the offers the ladies extended to him is part of his charm.\n\nThe show falls somewhere between a cop show and a comedy show. Although superficially following the police drama format, the comedy derives from outrageous plots, the self-deprecating Canadian and the assertive American [[stereotype]]s, and the occasional fantasy elements such as the regular visits paid to the Mountie by his father's ghost, whose advice varies between helpful and absurdly useless. The tone of the show and much of the comedy is derived from Fraser's supernormal detective ability. For instance, in one episode, Fraser tracks down a suspect by smelling the breath of a rat to determine the brand of barbecued ribs it had been eating. Another recurring gag is Fraser standing guard motionlessly in front of the Canadian consulate, while a passerby attempts to make him move or speak.\n\nAmongst other themes are Vecchio's (and Kowalski's) growing annoyance with Fraser's unorthodox style, and Vecchio's fondness of the 1972 [[Buick Riviera]], of which he has owned three (the first two having been blown up during the earlier seasons. The car is often incorrectly referred to as a 1971 model). During season 1, prior to the first appearance of his father's ghost, Fraser was often seen reading from one of the senior Fraser's journals, usually a passage with some relevance to the plot of the episode.\n\n===Historical influences===\nSeveral guest characters have names similar to Canadian former and British Prime Ministers, such as [[John Diefenbaker]], [[Margaret Thatcher]], [[MacKenzie King]], Louise St. Laurent (a play on [[Louis St. Laurent]]), and Dr. Esther Pearson (a parody of [[Lester Pearson]]).\n\nThe radio and television series ''[[Sergeant Preston of the Yukon]]'' was an influence on writer [[Paul Haggis]];<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://home.hiwaay.net/~warydbom/duesouth/haggischat.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930023548/http://home.hiwaay.net/~warydbom/duesouth/haggischat.htm|url-status=dead|title=Paul Haggis Q&A Session - 1999<!-- Bot generated title -->|archivedate=September 30, 2007}}</ref> Diefenbaker's being named after a Prime Minister is apparently an allusion to Sergeant Preston's dog, who was named \u2018[[Yukon King|King]].\u2019\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|Due South characters}}\n\n===Main characters===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

He is a [[wolfdog]],<ref>Constable Fraser does not know what breed(s) the dog part is, \"The Wild Bunch\" 19:15.</ref> originally from northern Canada, who now lives in [[Chicago]] with his owner, [[Benton Fraser|Fraser]]. He is named after former [[Prime Minister of Canada]] [[John Diefenbaker|John George Diefenbaker]].  In the season 1 episode, \"The Wild Bunch\", he fathers several puppies or cubs, two of whom are named Sunshine and Buster, by a [[husky]] named Maggie.<ref>\"The Wild Bunch\" 45:06.</ref>\n\nDiefenbaker met Fraser when the Mountie found him in an abandoned mine. Diefenbaker later pulled Fraser out of [[Prince Rupert Harbour|Prince Rupert Sound]], saving the Mountie's life, but also bursting the wolf's [[eardrum]]s - which resulted in, according to Fraser, Diefenbaker's deafness. Whether Diefenbaker is actually deaf, and not just suffering from selective hearing, is up to the viewer. Diefenbaker is apparently able to read lips, in both English and [[Inuktitut]]. Diefenbaker has stayed with Fraser ever since and has gone wherever the Mountie is posted.  In the final minutes of ''Pizzas and Promises'', Fraser mentions that Diefenbaker has his own [[savings account]], and that he (Fraser) does not like to touch Diefenbaker's [[money]].\n\nDiefenbaker is extremely loyal to Fraser, if sometimes disobedient, and will attack someone if required to defend Fraser. He is usually quite laid back - for a wolf. Since moving to Chicago, (for which Fraser's friend [[Ray Vecchio|Detective Ray Vecchio]] forged him a special \"''wolf permit,''\") Diefenbaker has developed a taste for [[junk food]], much to Fraser's disdain.\n\nThe role of Diefenbaker was played in the pilot movie by a mixed breed named Newman, then in the rest of seasons 1 and 2 by a purebred [[Siberian Husky]] named Lincoln.<ref>{{cite web | last =Rydbom | first =William | title =Lincoln Biography | date =2007-12-11 | url =http://home.hiwaay.net/~warydbom/duesouth/bios/lincoln.html | accessdate =2008-02-22 | url-status =dead | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20080208101819/http://home.hiwaay.net/~warydbom/duesouth/bios/lincoln.html | archivedate =2008-02-08 }}</ref> When the show was brought back for season 3, Lincoln was replaced by another purebred Siberian Husky named Draco,<ref>{{cite web | last =Rydbom | first =William | title =Draco Biography | date =2007-01-06 | url =http://home.hiwaay.net/~warydbom/duesouth/bios/draco.html | accessdate =2008-02-22 | url-status =dead | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20080208101807/http://home.hiwaay.net/~warydbom/duesouth/bios/draco.html | archivedate =2008-02-08 }}</ref> whose sister, Cinder, did most of his stunts.<ref>{{cite web | last =Dickenson | first =Elyse | title =Who is Diefenbaker? | date =2007-09-06 | url =http://home.hiwaay.net/~warydbom/duesouth/dief2.htm | accessdate =2008-02-22 | url-status =dead | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20080207030421/http://home.hiwaay.net/~warydbom/duesouth/dief2.htm | archivedate =2008-02-07 }}</ref> A variety of stunt dogs were used throughout the series, and fake dogs have also been used in some scenes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Walter Klassen FX -- Dogs |url=http://www.walterklassen.com/Props/dogs.htm |accessdate=2007-12-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080116174539/http://www.walterklassen.com/Props/dogs.htm |archivedate=January 16, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nDiefenbaker received the first fan mail for the series.<ref>{{cite web|title=Keekawa Siberians on TV series \"Due South\" |url=http://www.magma.ca/~keekawa/duesouthinfo.html |accessdate=2007-12-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923150136/http://www.magma.ca/~keekawa/duesouthinfo.html |archivedate=2006-09-23 }}</ref> Draco appeared on the officially licensed merchandise T-shirt of Diefenbaker.<ref>{{cite web| title =Due South - Merchandise | url =http://www.tour-de-france.cz/duesouth/merchandise_en.asp | accessdate =2007-12-15}}</ref>\n\nNaming this character after a famous Canadian particularly appeals to the Canadian audience of the series.

The Toronto police used the same light-blue-on-white [[Sillitoe Tartan]] pattern hatband as the Chicago Police Department, making it easier for them to double for them. In many episodes a [[Toronto Transit Commission]] bus can be seen in the background. In others, prominent city landmarks such as the [[CN Tower]] and the [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]] can be glimpsed. The U.S. Consulate in Toronto was used for exterior shots of the supposed Canadian Consulate in Chicago. Part of the series was shot in [[Banff National Park]], [[Alberta]].\n\n==Media==\n\n===Books===\n''Due South: The Official Companion'' by Geoff Tibballs was published in May 1998 containing basic information on the series and cast and brief episodes synopses up to the end of the third season. Another illustrated companion, ''Due South: The Official Guide'' by John A. Macdonald was published in December 1998. It contains some interviews with the characters and bios of the cast.\n\nFour paperback novelizations by Tom McGregor were published in the UK; these were:\n* ''Death in the Wilderness'' (1996), based on the pilot movie\n* ''An Invitation to Romance'' (1996), based on the episodes \"An Invitation to Romance\" and \"Gift of the Wheelman\"\n* ''Vaulting North'' (1997), based on \"North\" and \"Vault\"\n* ''All the Queen's Horses'' (1997), based on \"All the Queen's Horses\" and \"Red, White or Blue\"\n\n===Videos===\nThe pilot two-hour movie was originally released on [[VHS]] in 1996, but individual episodes had been released prior to this throughout 1995 on VHS with two episodes per tape. In 1998, the season three and the season four two-part finales were released. In November 2002, the ''Due South Giftset'' was released containing the pilot movie and episodes ''Mountie on the Bounty'' and ''Call of the Wild''.\n\n===DVD releases===\n[[Alliance Atlantis]] released all 4 seasons on DVD in Canada only.

The convention featured games, discussion panels, a formal dinner, and guest panels. Numerous cast and crew members have attended, including [[David Marciano]] (1998), [[Paul Gross]] (1999), [[Gordon Pinsent]] (1998), Tom Melissis (1997, 1998, 1999), Tony Craig (1997), Catherine Bruhier (1998, 1999) and [[Jay Semko]] (1998, 1999). Draco (Diefenbaker) and his trainer, Gail Parker, were guests in both 1998 and 1999.\n\nAfter a nine-year hiatus, the convention was revived in 2008, with guest panels from [[David Marciano]], [[Jay Semko]], Tom Melissis, Catherine Bruhier, and Gail Parker with Cinder, Draco's sister and stunt-double. Another convention was held in August 2010, with [[Paul Gross]], [[Jay Semko]], Tom Melissis, [[Camilla Scott]], Tony Craig, Catherine Bruhier, and Ramona Milano.\n\nRCW 139: From a Million Miles was held from August 17\u201319, 2012 in Toronto. This event included tours and dining in the Distillery District of Toronto and the Patrician Grill, both of which were frequently used for location filming.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rcw139.org|title=RCW 139: From a Million Miles|accessdate=17 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nRCW 139: Thank You Kindly was held from August 15\u201317, 2014 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of ''Due South.''

Upon the end of the series in 1999, BBC Two immediately began to screen repeats, and the series was also rescreened on [[ITV3]] in 2006, and again on BBC Two from October 18, 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00vk2fz/episodes/2010 |title=Two Programmes - Due South - Episodes from 2010 |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2011-03-02}}</ref> A rerun on digital channel [[True Entertainment]] began on October 10, 2014 with the pilot, with regular-series episodes following on weekdays from October 13.\n\n==Story overview==\n{{main|List of Due South episodes}}\n\nThe premise of the series centres on a [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP) [[constable]] named [[Benton Fraser]] ([[Paul Gross]]) who travels to [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] to solve the murder of his father; this is how he meets his soon-to-be partner, [[Raymond Vecchio|Ray Vecchio]] ([[David Marciano]]), a tough, streetwise cop. Accompanied by his deaf lip-reading half-wolf Diefenbaker (whom Fraser adopted after Diefenbaker saved his life), the investigation leads Fraser to uncover a plot by a company building a dam that is slowly killing the environment. This leads to the dam being shut down and many people losing their jobs. He also implicates corrupt members of the RCMP in the affair. This along with the loss of so many peoples' jobs makes him [[persona non grata]] in Canada, and he finds himself stationed in Chicago. This plot line is referred to repeatedly during the series, and from season three on he introduces himself to many by saying:\n\n<blockquote>I first came to Chicago on the trail of the killers of my father and, for reasons which don't need exploring at this juncture, I have remained, attached as liaison to the Canadian consulate.</blockquote>\n\nMarciano, the original Ray, left the series after the second season; however, he appeared in the first and last of the post-1997 episodes. His replacement was [[Callum Keith Rennie]] as [[Stanley Kowalski (Due South)|Stanley Raymond Kowalski]], a detective who was under orders to impersonate Vecchio while the real Vecchio was undercover. Marciano did return for the series finale, in which Vecchio returned to Chicago to break up a weapons-smuggling ring, and eventually ran off to Florida with Kowalski's ex-wife, Stella. Also in that episode, Benton and his father's ghost finally solve Benton's mother's murder, resulting in Fraser Sr.'s departure to rejoin his wife. The series ends with Benton and Kowalski in search of the graves of the [[Franklin expedition]], immortalized in the Canadian folk song \"[[Northwest Passage (song)|Northwest Passage]]\", which Paul Gross sings in the episode.\n\n===Recurring themes===\n{{original research|date=May 2016}}\nBenton Fraser is the archetypal Mountie: dogged, polite, and compulsively truthful. The series often featured his rigid moral code being tested by the cynical realities of Chicago life. Being overly polite, Fraser's best known short quotes were \"thank you kindly\"; when he found himself in trouble, an understated \"oh dear\"; and, when faced with contradictory circumstances from other characters, an all-knowing and eloquently stated \"understood\". More unusual is his encyclopedic knowledge of trivia (attributed to his grandparents having been librarians) and a range of uncanny abilities. These include his ability to sniff and lick refuse from the streets to gain clues about crimes, the way he can fall into a dumpster or other waste heap and emerge completely spotless and unwrinkled, and the way many women he encounters fall madly in love with him, including his boss Margaret (Meg) Thatcher and Ray's sister Francesca. The fact that he rarely pursues any of the offers the ladies extended to him is part of his charm.\n\nThe show falls somewhere between a cop show and a comedy show. Although superficially following the police drama format, the comedy derives from outrageous plots, the self-deprecating Canadian and the assertive American [[stereotype]]s, and the occasional fantasy elements such as the regular visits paid to the Mountie by his father's ghost, whose advice varies between helpful and absurdly useless. The tone of the show and much of the comedy is derived from Fraser's supernormal detective ability. For instance, in one episode, Fraser tracks down a suspect by smelling the breath of a rat to determine the brand of barbecued ribs it had been eating. Another recurring gag is Fraser standing guard motionlessly in front of the Canadian consulate, while a passerby attempts to make him move or speak.\n\nAmongst other themes are Vecchio's (and Kowalski's) growing annoyance with Fraser's unorthodox style, and Vecchio's fondness of the 1972 [[Buick Riviera]], of which he has owned three (the first two having been blown up during the earlier seasons. The car is often incorrectly referred to as a 1971 model). During season 1, prior to the first appearance of his father's ghost, Fraser was often seen reading from one of the senior Fraser's journals, usually a passage with some relevance to the plot of the episode.\n\n===Historical influences===\nSeveral guest characters have names similar to Canadian former and British Prime Ministers, such as [[John Diefenbaker]], [[Margaret Thatcher]], [[MacKenzie King]], Louise St. Laurent (a play on [[Louis St. Laurent]]), and Dr. Esther Pearson (a parody of [[Lester Pearson]]).\n\nThe radio and television series ''[[Sergeant Preston of the Yukon]]'' was an influence on writer [[Paul Haggis]];<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://home.hiwaay.net/~warydbom/duesouth/haggischat.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930023548/http://home.hiwaay.net/~warydbom/duesouth/haggischat.htm|url-status=dead|title=Paul Haggis Q&A Session - 1999<!-- Bot generated title -->|archivedate=September 30, 2007}}</ref> Diefenbaker's being named after a Prime Minister is apparently an allusion to Sergeant Preston\u2019s dog, who was named \u2018[[Yukon King|King]].\u2019\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|Due South characters}}\n\n===Main characters===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

He is a [[wolfdog]],<ref>Constable Fraser does not know what breed(s) the dog part is, \"The Wild Bunch\" 19:15.</ref> originally from northern Canada, who now lives in [[Chicago]] with his owner, [[Benton Fraser|Fraser]]. He is named after former [[Prime Minister of Canada]] [[John Diefenbaker|John George Diefenbaker]].  In the season 1 episode, \"The Wild Bunch\", he fathers several puppies or cubs, two of whom are named Sunshine and Buster, by a [[husky]] named Maggie.<ref>\"The Wild Bunch\" 45:06.</ref>\n\nDiefenbaker met Fraser when the Mountie found him in an abandoned mine. Diefenbaker later pulled Fraser out of [[Prince Rupert Harbour|Prince Rupert Sound]], saving the Mountie's life, but also bursting the wolf's [[eardrum]]s - which resulted in, according to Fraser, Diefenbaker's deafness. Whether Diefenbaker is actually deaf, and not just suffering from selective hearing, is up to the viewer. Diefenbaker is apparently able to read lips, in both English and [[Inuktitut]]. Diefenbaker has stayed with Fraser ever since and has gone wherever the Mountie is posted.  In the final minutes of ''Pizzas and Promises'', Fraser mentions that Diefenbaker has his own [[savings account]], and that he (Fraser) does not like to touch Diefenbaker's [[money]].\n\nDiefenbaker is extremely loyal to Fraser, if sometimes disobedient, and will attack someone if required to defend Fraser. He is usually quite laid back - for a wolf. Since moving to Chicago, (for which Fraser's friend [[Ray Vecchio|Detective Ray Vecchio]] forged him a special \"''wolf permit,''\") Diefenbaker has developed a taste for [[junk food]], much to Fraser's disdain.\n\nThe role of Diefenbaker was played in the pilot movie by a mixed breed named Newman, then in the rest of seasons 1 and 2 by a purebred [[Siberian Husky]] named Lincoln.<ref>{{cite web | last =Rydbom | first =William | title =Lincoln Biography | date =2007-12-11 | url =http://home.hiwaay.net/~warydbom/duesouth/bios/lincoln.html | accessdate =2008-02-22 | url-status =dead | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20080208101819/http://home.hiwaay.net/~warydbom/duesouth/bios/lincoln.html | archivedate =2008-02-08 }}</ref> When the show was brought back for season 3, Lincoln was replaced by another purebred Siberian Husky named Draco,<ref>{{cite web | last =Rydbom | first =William | title =Draco Biography | date =2007-01-06 | url =http://home.hiwaay.net/~warydbom/duesouth/bios/draco.html | accessdate =2008-02-22 | url-status =dead | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20080208101807/http://home.hiwaay.net/~warydbom/duesouth/bios/draco.html | archivedate =2008-02-08 }}</ref> whose sister, Cinder, did most of his stunts.<ref>{{cite web | last =Dickenson | first =Elyse | title =Who is Diefenbaker? | date =2007-09-06 | url =http://home.hiwaay.net/~warydbom/duesouth/dief2.htm | accessdate =2008-02-22 | url-status =dead | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20080207030421/http://home.hiwaay.net/~warydbom/duesouth/dief2.htm | archivedate =2008-02-07 }}</ref> A variety of stunt dogs were used throughout the series, and fake dogs have also been used in some scenes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Walter Klassen FX -- Dogs |url=http://www.walterklassen.com/Props/dogs.htm |accessdate=2007-12-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080116174539/http://www.walterklassen.com/Props/dogs.htm |archivedate=January 16, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nDiefenbaker received the first fan mail for the series.<ref>{{cite web|title=Keekawa Siberians on TV series \"Due South\" |url=http://www.magma.ca/~keekawa/duesouthinfo.html |accessdate=2007-12-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923150136/http://www.magma.ca/~keekawa/duesouthinfo.html |archivedate=2006-09-23 }}</ref> Draco appeared on the officially licensed merchandise T-shirt of Diefenbaker.<ref>{{cite web| title =Due South - Merchandise | url =http://www.tour-de-france.cz/duesouth/merchandise_en.asp | accessdate =2007-12-15}}</ref>\n\nNaming this character after a famous Canadian particularly appeals to the Canadian audience of the series.

The Toronto police used the same light-blue-on-white [[Sillitoe Tartan]] pattern hatband as the Chicago Police Department, making it easier for them to double for them. In many episodes a [[Toronto Transit Commission]] bus can be seen in the background. In others, prominent city landmarks such as the [[CN Tower]] and the [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]] can be glimpsed. The U.S. Consulate in Toronto was used for exterior shots of the supposed Canadian Consulate in Chicago. Part of the series was shot in [[Banff National Park]], [[Alberta]].\n\n==Media==\n\n===Books===\n''Due South: The Official Companion'' by Geoff Tibballs was published in May 1998 containing basic information on the series and cast and brief episodes synopses up to the end of the third season. Another illustrated companion, ''Due South: The Official Guide'' by John A. Macdonald was published in December 1998. It contains some interviews with the characters and bios of the cast.\n\nFour paperback novelizations by Tom McGregor were published in the UK; these were:\n* ''Death in the Wilderness'' (1996), based on the pilot movie\n* ''An Invitation to Romance'' (1996), based on the episodes \"An Invitation to Romance\" and \"Gift of the Wheelman\"\n* ''Vaulting North'' (1997), based on \"North\" and \"Vault\"\n* ''All the Queen's Horses'' (1997), based on \"All the Queen's Horses\" and \"Red, White or Blue\"\n\n===Videos===\nThe pilot two-hour movie was originally released on [[VHS]] in 1996, but individual episodes had been released prior to this throughout 1995 on VHS with two episodes per tape. In 1998, the season three and the season four two-part finales were released. In November 2002, the ''Due South Giftset'' was released containing the pilot movie and episodes ''Mountie on the Bounty'' and ''Call of the Wild''.\n\n===DVD releases===\n[[Alliance Atlantis]] released all 4 seasons on DVD in Canada only.

[[Sarah McLachlan]]'s music was most prominently featured with no fewer than seven songs over the full run of the series; other recurring artists included [[The Headstones]], [[Loreena McKennitt]] and [[Colin James]]. \"The Blue Line\" (episode #1.16) featured \"[[The Hockey Theme]]\", the longtime theme song of [[CBC Television]]'s sports series ''[[Hockey Night in Canada]]''.<ref name=\"imdb\"/>\n\nThe show's theme was written and composed by [[Jay Semko]] of [[The Northern Pikes]] (who recorded a version of the song with lyrics, played during the show's closing credits) working with [[Jack Lenz]] and John McCarthy.

RCW 139 was held annually in Toronto between 1996 and 1999, attracting approximately 300 fans from more than 10 countries in both 1998 and 1999. The convention featured games, discussion panels, a formal dinner, and guest panels. Numerous cast and crew members have attended, including [[David Marciano]] (1998), [[Paul Gross]] (1999), [[Gordon Pinsent]] (1998), Tom Melissis (1997, 1998, 1999), Tony Craig (1997), Catherine Bruhier (1998, 1999) and [[Jay Semko]] (1998, 1999). Draco (Diefenbaker) and his trainer, Gail Parker, were guests in both 1998 and 1999.\n\nAfter a nine-year hiatus, the convention was revived in 2008, with guest panels from [[David Marciano]], [[Jay Semko]], Tom Melissis, Catherine Bruhier, and Gail Parker with Cinder, Draco's sister and stunt-double. Another convention was held in August 2010, with [[Paul Gross]], [[Jay Semko]], Tom Melissis, [[Camilla Scott]], Tony Craig, Catherine Bruhier, and Ramona Milano.\n\nRCW 139: From a Million Miles was held from August 17\u201319, 2012 in Toronto. This event included tours and dining in the Distillery District of Toronto and the Patrician Grill, both of which were frequently used for location filming.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rcw139.org|title=RCW 139: From a Million Miles|accessdate=17 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nRCW 139: Thank You Kindly was held from August 15\u201317, 2014 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of ''Due South.'' Catherine Bruhier, Ramona Milano, Tom Melissis, and Tony Craig, along with guest star Lisa Jakub (\"Chicago Holiday\" [#1.07/1.08]), appeared on the cast panel; assistant directors Michael Bowman and Woody Sidarous, costume supervisor Alex Kavanagh, and prop master Craig Williams formed the crew panel.

In the \"astral mysticism\" of the classical world the human psyche was composed of the same material, thus accounting for the influence of the stars upon human affairs. In his commentaries on Plato's [[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]], [[Proclus]] wrote;\n\n<blockquote>Man is a little world (mikros cosmos). For, just like the Whole, he possesses both mind and reason, both a divine and a mortal body. He is also divided up according to the universe. It is for this reason, you know, that some are accustomed to say that his consciousness corresponds with the nature of the fixed stars, his reason in its contemplative aspect with Saturn and in its social aspect with Jupiter, (and) as to his irrational part, the passionate nature with Mars, the eloquent with Mercury, the appetitive with Venus, the sensitive with the Sun and the vegetative with the Moon.<ref>Quoted in; G.R.S.Mead, ''The Doctrine of the Subtle Body in Western Tradition'', Watkins 1919, page 84 (Slightly adapted).</ref></blockquote>\n\nSuch doctrines were commonplace in mystery-schools and [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] and [[gnostic]] sects throughout the Roman Empire and influenced the early Christian church.<ref>[[Frederick Copleston]], ''The History of Philosophy Vol 2'', IMAGE BOOKS 1993&ndash;1994.</ref> Paul's Second Epistle to the Corinthians contains a reference to the astral plane or [[astral projection]]:<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hankins|first1=James|title=Ficino, Avicenna and the Occult Powers of the Rational Soul|url=http://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/3223908}}</ref> \"I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven.

Scholars took up the Greek Neoplatonist accounts as well as similar material in [[Hindu]] and [[Zoroastrian]] texts.<ref>The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad: \"There are two states for man &ndash; the state in this world and the state in the next; there is also a third state, the state intermediate between these two, which can be likened to the dream [state]. While in the intermediate state a man experiences both the other states, that of this world and that in the next; and the manner whereof is as follows: when he dies he lives only in the subtle body, on which are left the impressions of his past deeds, and of those impressions is he aware, illumined as they are by the light of the Transcendent Self\"</ref> The expositions of [[Ibn Sina]] (Avicenna), the [[Brotherhood of Purity]] and others, when translated into Latin in the Norman era, were to have a profound effect upon European mediaeval alchemy and astrology. By the 14th century [[Dante]] was describing his own imaginary journey through the astral spheres of Paradise.<ref>[[Miguel As\u00edn Palacios]] ''La Escatolog\u00eda musulmana en la Divina Comedia [Muslim Eschatology in the Divine Comedy]'' (1919).

Once the telescope established that no spiritual heaven was visible around the solar system, the idea was superseded in mainstream science.{{citation needed|reason=Content unavailable|date=May 2016}}\n\n==The Astral Plane and Astral Experience==\n{{planes of existence}}\nAccording to occult teachings the astral plane can be visited consciously through [[astral projection]], [[meditation]] and [[mantra]], [[near death experience]], [[lucid dreaming]], or other means.  Individuals that are trained in the use of the astral vehicle can separate their consciousness in the astral vehicle from the physical body at will.<ref>J. H. Brennan, ''Astral Doorways'', Thoth Publications 1996 {{ISBN|978-1-870450-21-8}}; Robert Monroe, \"Journeys out of the Body,\"</ref> The first stage in development, according to [[Ramacharaka]], is \"mastery of the physical body and its care and attention\", which pertains not only to the physical body but also to its double in the astral. <ref name=\":0\" />In addition, one must spend time tuning the \"instinctive mind\".<ref name=\":0\" /> The first three subdivisions of the instinctive mind are passions, desires, and lusts. The second stage is the intellect, otherwise known as the sharpening of the mind. Someone operating largely out of the instinctive mind would \"have only a glimmering of intellect\", therefore those who are centered in the intellect would only have an inkling of the spiritual. Once both stages are completed the spiritual mind can be awakened. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn early [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophical]] literature the term \"astral\" may refer to the [[aether (classical element)|aether]]. Later theosophical authors such as [[Annie Besant]] and [[C. W. Leadbeater]] make the astral finer than the [[etheric plane]] but \"denser\" than the [[mental plane]].  In order to create a unified view of seven bodies and remove earlier [[Sanskrit]] terms, an [[etheric plane]] was introduced and the term \"astral body\" was used to replace the former [[kamarupa]] - sometimes termed the ''body of emotion, illusion or desire''.<ref name=\"G.R.S.Mead, 1919\" /> Some of those propounding such claims explain their belief that letting go of desires is spiritual progress by noting that, the more one let's go of earthly 'desire' feelings, the less tied down to the physical world, a world of illusion, and the more connected to the astral, where all is visible and known.<ref>Frank Lester, The Eternal Verities, 1962, Sedona, Az, pp. 31-35</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Max Heindel]]'s [[Rosicrucian]] writings, ''desire-stuff'' may be described as a type of force-matter, in incessant motion, responsive to the slightest ''feeling''. The desire world is also said to be the abode of the dead for some time subsequent to death.  It is also the home  of the [[archangels]].

In the \"astral mysticism\" of the classical world the human psyche was composed of the same material, thus accounting for the influence of the stars upon human affairs. In his commentaries on Plato's [[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]], [[Proclus]] wrote;\n\n<blockquote>Man is a little world (mikros cosmos). For, just like the Whole, he possesses both mind and reason, both a divine and a mortal body. He is also divided up according to the universe. It is for this reason, you know, that some are accustomed to say that his consciousness corresponds with the nature of the fixed stars, his reason in its contemplative aspect with Saturn and in its social aspect with Jupiter, (and) as to his irrational part, the passionate nature with Mars, the eloquent with Mercury, the appetitive with Venus, the sensitive with the Sun and the vegetative with the Moon.<ref>Quoted in; G.R.S.Mead, ''The Doctrine of the Subtle Body in Western Tradition'', Watkins 1919, page 84 (Slightly adapted).</ref></blockquote>\n\nSuch doctrines were commonplace in mystery-schools and [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] and [[gnostic]] sects throughout the Roman Empire and influenced the early Christian church.<ref>[[Frederick Copleston]], ''The History of Philosophy Vol 2'', IMAGE BOOKS 1993&ndash;1994.</ref> Paul's Second Epistle to the Corinthians contains a reference to the astral plane or [[astral projection]]:<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hankins|first1=James|title=Ficino, Avicenna and the Occult Powers of the Rational Soul|url=http://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/3223908}}</ref> \"I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven.

While in the intermediate state a man experiences both the other states, that of this world and that in the next; and the manner whereof is as follows: when he dies he lives only in the subtle body, on which are left the impressions of his past deeds, and of those impressions is he aware, illumined as they are by the light of the Transcendent Self\"</ref> The expositions of [[Ibn Sina]] (Avicenna), the [[Brotherhood of Purity]] and others, when translated into Latin in the Norman era, were to have a profound effect upon European mediaeval alchemy and astrology.

The second stage is the intellect, otherwise known as the sharpening of the mind.

In order to create a unified view of seven bodies and remove earlier [[Sanskrit]] terms, an [[etheric plane]] was introduced and the term \"astral body\" was used to replace the former [[kamarupa]] - sometimes termed the ''body of emotion, illusion or desire''.<ref name=\"G.R.S.Mead, 1919\" /> Some of those propounding such claims explain their belief that letting go of desires is spiritual progress by noting that, the more one let's go of earthly 'desire' feelings, the less tied down to the physical world, a world of illusion, and the more connected to the astral, where all is visible and known.<ref>Frank Lester, The Eternal Verities, 1962, Sedona, Az, pp. 31-35</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Max Heindel]]'s [[Rosicrucian]] writings, ''desire-stuff'' may be described as a type of force-matter, in incessant motion, responsive to the slightest ''feeling''. The desire world is also said to be the abode of the dead for some time subsequent to death.  It is also the home  of the [[archangels]].

{"title_page": "Naked objects", "text_new": "{{multiple issues|\n{{Inadequate lead|date=April 2020}}\n{{Confusing|date=April 2020}}\n}}\n\n'''Naked objects''' is an [[Architectural pattern (computer science)|architectural pattern]] used in [[software engineering]].\n\n==Definition==\n\nThe naked objects pattern is defined by three principles:\n\n{{ordered list | list_style_type=decimal | start=1\n|\nAll [[business logic]] should be encapsulated onto the [[business object (computer science)|domain objects]]. This principle is not unique to naked objects: it is a strong commitment to [[information hiding|encapsulation]].\n|\nThe [[user interface]] should be a direct representation of the domain objects, with all user actions consisting of creating, retrieving, or invoking [[method (computer science)|methods]] on domain objects. This principle is not unique to naked objects: it is an interpretation of an [[object-oriented user interface]] (OOUI). \n}}\n\nThe naked object pattern's innovative feature arises by combining the {{ordinal|1}} and {{ordinal|2}} principles into a {{ordinal|3}} principle:\n\n{{ordered list | list_style_type=decimal | start=3\n|\nThe user interface shall be entirely automatically created from the definitions of the domain objects. This may be done using several different technologies, including [[source code generation]]. To date{{when?|date=April 2018}}, implementations{{which?|date=April 2018}} of the naked objects pattern have favored the technology of [[Reflection (computer science)|reflection]].\n}}\n\nThe naked objects pattern was first described formally in Richard Pawson's PhD thesis<ref name=\"pawson\">{{cite thesis |degree=Ph.D. |last=Pawson |first=Richard |date=June 2004 |title=Naked objects |url=http://downloads.nakedobjects.net/resources/Pawson%20thesis.pdf |publisher=[[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]], [[University of Dublin]]}}</ref> which includes a thorough investigation of various antecedents and inspirations for the pattern including, for example, the [[Morphic (software)|Morphic]] user interface. \n\nNaked Objects is commonly contrasted with the [[model\u2013view\u2013controller]] pattern. However, the published version of Pawson's thesis (see References) contains a foreword by [[Trygve Reenskaug]], who first formulated the model\u2013view\u2013controller pattern, suggesting that naked objects is closer to the original intent of model\u2013view\u2013controller (MVC) than many of the subsequent interpretations and implementations.\n\n==Benefits==\n\nPawson's thesis claims four benefits for the pattern:\n\n#'''A faster development cycle''', because there are fewer layers to develop. In a more conventional design, the developer must define and implement three or more separate layers: the domain object layer, the presentation layer, and the task or process scripts that connect the two. (If the naked objects pattern is combined with [[object-relational mapping]] or an [[object database]], then it is possible to create ''all'' layers of the system from the domain object definitions alone;  however, this does not form part of the naked objects pattern ''per se''.) The thesis includes a case study comparing two different implementations of the same application: one based on a conventional '4-layer' implementation; the other using naked objects.\n#'''Greater agility''', referring to the ease with which an application may be altered to accommodate future changes in business requirements. In part this arises from the reduction in the number of developed layers that must be kept in synchronisation.  However the claim is also made that the enforced 1:1 correspondence between the user presentation and the domain model, forces higher-quality [[object model]]ling, which in turn improves the agility.\n#'''A more empowering style of user interface'''.  This benefit is really attributable to the resulting [[object-oriented user interface]] (OOUI), rather than to naked objects per se, although the argument is made that naked objects makes it much easier to conceive and to implement an OOUI.\n#'''Easier requirements analysis'''.  The argument here is that with the naked objects pattern, the domain objects form a common language between users and developers and that this common language facilitates the process of discussing requirements  -  because there are no other representations to discuss.  Combined with the faster development cycle, it becomes possible to prototype functional applications in real time.\n\n==Limitations==\n\nThe automatically generated [[object-oriented user interface]] is potentially suitable for [[sovereign application]]s but not for [[transient application]]s.{{ref?|date=January 2013}}\n\n==Software frameworks==\n\nThere are now several [[software framework]]s that implement the naked objects pattern:\n\n{{unordered list\n| [http://isis.apache.org/ Apache Isis] \n| [[BlueJ]]\n| [https://github.com/jmarine/doe/wiki/Domain-Object-Explorer Domain Object Explorer]\n| [http://www.codeplex.com/dotObjects dotObjects]\n| [http://entitiesframework.blogspot.com/ Entities]\n| [http://gengui.sourceforge.net/ gengui]\n| [http://www.jmatter.org/ JMatter]\n| [https://github.com/NakedObjectsGroup/NakedObjectsFramework/ Naked Objects Framework] \n| [https://github.com/subes/invesdwin-nowicket NoWicket]\n| [http://freshmeat.net/projects/sanssouci Sanssouci]\n| [http://www.tynamo.org/ Tynamo (successor of Trails)]\n}}\n\n==Practical experience==\n\nThe [[Department of Social Protection]] (DSP) (formerly known as the Department for Social and Family Affairs) in Ireland has built a suite of enterprise applications using the naked objects pattern. As part of its Service Delivery Modernisation (SDM) programme, the DSP designed a new enterprise architecture both to meet its planned new business requirements and to provide greater agility over the longer term. The naked objects pattern forms a key element of the SDM architecture.<ref name=\"sdm\">Department of Social and Family Affairs - Guide to the Functions & Records of the Department, [http://www.welfare.ie/EN/OperationalGuidelines/sect15/Pages/part5.aspx#5.13 DSFA website  -  Freedom Of Information]</ref> In November 2002, the DSP went live with a new application to replace its existing system for the administration of child benefit. This is believed to be the first operational application of the naked objects pattern, anywhere. The DSP's experience in building this first application, including the reactions of users to the radical user interface is documented extensively in Pawson's thesis,<ref name=\"pawson\"/> and more recently in a presentation at QCon London 2011.<ref name=\"qcon\">Case Study: Large-scale Pure OO at the Irish Government [http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Large-scale-Pure-OO-Irish-Government QCon London 2011]</ref>\n\nOne of the more striking aspects of the DSP experience was the way that the Naked Objects technique permitted re-use very actively.  Once a domain object, such as a Customer, had been defined for one 'application' it could be (has been) readily adapted with the minimum of tweaking and addition for use elsewhere.  This suggests that the approach could become a favourite in government circles, where re-use is seen as a powerful technique for breaking down siloed systems.  The UK 'Transformational Government' policy is particularly keen to see re-use become a standard requirement of new government systems, both consuming other governmental system components and making new ones available for others to use.

This principle is not unique to naked objects: it is a strong commitment to [[information hiding|encapsulation]].\n|\nThe [[user interface]] should be a direct representation of the domain objects, with all user actions consisting of creating, retrieving, or invoking [[method (computer science)|methods]] on domain objects. This principle is not unique to naked objects: it is an interpretation of an [[object-oriented user interface]] (OOUI). \n}}\n\nThe naked object pattern's innovative feature arises by combining the {{ordinal|1}} and {{ordinal|2}} principles into a {{ordinal|3}} principle:\n\n{{ordered list | list_style_type=decimal | start=3\n|\nThe user interface shall be entirely automatically created from the definitions of the domain objects. This may be done using several different technologies, including [[source code generation]]. To date{{when?|date=April 2018}}, implementations{{which?|date=April 2018}} of the naked objects pattern have favored the technology of [[Reflection (computer science)|reflection]].\n}}\n\nThe naked objects pattern was first described formally in Richard Pawson's PhD thesis<ref name=\"pawson\">{{cite thesis |degree=Ph.D. |last=Pawson |first=Richard |date=June 2004 |title=Naked objects |url=http://downloads.nakedobjects.net/resources/Pawson%20thesis.pdf |publisher=[[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]], [[University of Dublin]]}}</ref> which includes a thorough investigation of various antecedents and inspirations for the pattern including, for example, the [[Morphic (software)|Morphic]] user interface. \n\nNaked Objects is commonly contrasted with the [[model\u2013view\u2013controller]] pattern. However, the published version of Pawson's thesis (see References) contains a foreword by [[Trygve Reenskaug]], who first formulated the model\u2013view\u2013controller pattern, suggesting that naked objects is closer to the original intent of model\u2013view\u2013controller (MVC) than many of the subsequent interpretations and implementations.\n\n==Benefits==\n\nPawson's thesis claims four benefits for the pattern:\n\n#'''A faster development cycle''', because there are fewer layers to develop. In a more conventional design, the developer must define and implement three or more separate layers: the domain object layer, the presentation layer, and the task or process scripts that connect the two. (If the naked objects pattern is combined with [[object-relational mapping]] or an [[object database]], then it is possible to create ''all'' layers of the system from the domain object definitions alone;  however, this does not form part of the naked objects pattern ''per se''.) The thesis includes a case study comparing two different implementations of the same application: one based on a conventional '4-layer' implementation; the other using naked objects.\n#'''Greater agility''', referring to the ease with which an application may be altered to accommodate future changes in business requirements. In part this arises from the reduction in the number of developed layers that must be kept in synchronisation.  However the claim is also made that the enforced 1:1 correspondence between the user presentation and the domain model, forces higher-quality [[object model]]ling, which in turn improves the agility.\n#'''A more empowering style of user interface'''.  This benefit is really attributable to the resulting [[object-oriented user interface]] (OOUI), rather than to naked objects per se, although the argument is made that naked objects makes it much easier to conceive and to implement an OOUI.\n#'''Easier requirements analysis'''.  The argument here is that with the naked objects pattern, the domain objects form a common language between users and developers and that this common language facilitates the process of discussing requirements  -  because there are no other representations to discuss.  Combined with the faster development cycle, it becomes possible to prototype functional applications in real time.\n}}\n\n==Limitations==\n\nThe automatically generated [[object-oriented user interface]] is potentially suitable for [[sovereign application]]s but not for [[transient application]]s.{{ref?|date=January 2013}}\n\n==Software frameworks==\n\nThere are now several [[software framework]]s that implement the naked objects pattern:\n\n{{unordered list\n| [http://isis.apache.org/ Apache Isis] \n| [[BlueJ]]\n| [https://github.com/jmarine/doe/wiki/Domain-Object-Explorer Domain Object Explorer]\n| [http://www.codeplex.com/dotObjects dotObjects]\n| [http://entitiesframework.blogspot.com/ Entities]\n| [http://gengui.sourceforge.net/ gengui]\n| [http://www.jmatter.org/ JMatter]\n| [https://github.com/NakedObjectsGroup/NakedObjectsFramework/ Naked Objects Framework] \n| [https://github.com/subes/invesdwin-nowicket NoWicket]\n| [http://freshmeat.net/projects/sanssouci Sanssouci]\n| [http://www.tynamo.org/ Tynamo (successor of Trails)]\n}}\n\n==Practical experience==\n\nThe [[Department of Social Protection]] (DSP) (formerly known as the Department for Social and Family Affairs) in Ireland has built a suite of enterprise applications using the naked objects pattern. As part of its Service Delivery Modernisation (SDM) programme, the DSP designed a new enterprise architecture both to meet its planned new business requirements and to provide greater agility over the longer term. The naked objects pattern forms a key element of the SDM architecture.<ref name=\"sdm\">Department of Social and Family Affairs - Guide to the Functions & Records of the Department, [http://www.welfare.ie/EN/OperationalGuidelines/sect15/Pages/part5.aspx#5.13 DSFA website  -  Freedom Of Information]</ref> In November 2002, the DSP went live with a new application to replace its existing system for the administration of child benefit. This is believed to be the first operational application of the naked objects pattern, anywhere. The DSP's experience in building this first application, including the reactions of users to the radical user interface is documented extensively in Pawson's thesis,<ref name=\"pawson\"/> and more recently in a presentation at QCon London 2011.<ref name=\"qcon\">Case Study: Large-scale Pure OO at the Irish Government [http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Large-scale-Pure-OO-Irish-Government QCon London 2011]</ref>\n\nOne of the more striking aspects of the DSP experience was the way that the Naked Objects technique permitted re-use very actively.  Once a domain object, such as a Customer, had been defined for one 'application' it could be (has been) readily adapted with the minimum of tweaking and addition for use elsewhere.  This suggests that the approach could become a favourite in government circles, where re-use is seen as a powerful technique for breaking down siloed systems.  The UK 'Transformational Government' policy is particularly keen to see re-use become a standard requirement of new government systems, both consuming other governmental system components and making new ones available for others to use.
