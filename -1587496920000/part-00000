The introduction of these novel categories in the Jaina tradition, therefore, can hardly be explained without references to the legends surrounding the two popular figures of the early Vaishnava tradition, namely [[Balarama]] and Krishna of Mathura.<ref name = \"Doniger\"/>\n\nArchaeological remains found in the region of [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]] support the fact that the popularity of these two divine figures had reached its zenith in the [[Mauryan]] and the [[Shunga Empire|Shunga]] period and associated Bhagavata religion had become widespread throughout Mathura and Western India areas. This period coincides with the large migrations of Jainas from Magadha to [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]]. Baladeva is referred to by Jaina Puranas as Halabhrit, without any support from Brahminical texts. All the Vasudevas are modeled after the description of Krishna found in the [[Purana]]s. They are called blue-black (nila) in complexion and are designated by several names that are normally applied exclusively to Krishna e.g. Keshava, Madhava, Govinda, Vishnu and Narayana (which is used as synonym for the name Vasudeva).

This period coincides with the large migrations of Jainas from Magadha to [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]]. Baladeva is referred to by Jaina Puranas as Halabhrit, without any support from Brahminical texts. All the Vasudevas are modeled after the description of Krishna found in the [[Purana]]s. They are called blue-black (nila) in complexion and are designated by several names that are normally applied exclusively to Krishna e.g. Keshava, Madhava, Govinda, Vishnu and Narayana (which is used as synonym for the name Vasudeva).

Its books are designed to be quick reads and treat advanced topics in web design with a strong point of view.\n\n== Web Design Conference ==\nIn 2005, Zeldman and [[Eric A. Meyer]] founded An Event Apart, \"the design conference for people who make websites.\" An Event Apart is an \"intensely educational two-day learning session for passionate practitioners of standards-based web design\" followed by an optional day-long workshop on such topics as mobile web design, advanced accessible web design, HTML5, and CSS3. The conference currently takes place in seven cities annually. Cities and speakers vary. Speakers, in addition to offering informative content, must have made major contributions to web design or development in order to qualify to speak at the event.\n\n== Innovations ==\nZeldman and Happy Cog were early advocates of standards-based web design and many of their current and former employees have greatly contributed to various initiatives on the web, including:\n* The development of \"real type on the web\" via CSS and services including [[Typekit]].\n* Popularizing such ideas as [[CSS layout]], [[responsive design]], and style switching. The latter was an early 2000 innovation which paved the way for later third-party innovations including [[CSS Zen Garden]] and a web site known as Readability.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.readability.com|title=Readability}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*{{Cite book| publisher = Rockport Publishers| isbn = 978-1-59253-895-9| last1 = Apfelbaum| first1 = Sue| last2 = Cezzar| first2 = Juliette| title = Designing the Editorial Experience: A Primer for Print, Web, and Mobile| location = Beverly, MA| date = 2014| ref={{sfnRef|Apfelbaum and Cezzar}}}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Cederholm|first1=Dan|title=Web standards solutions: the markup and style handbook|date=2004|publisher=Apress|location=Berkeley, Calif.|isbn=1590593812|edition=1st|ref={{sfnRef|Cederholm}}|url=https://archive.org/details/webstandardssolu00cede}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Clarke|first1=Andy|title=Hardboiled web design|date=2010|publisher=Five Simple Steps|location=Penarth [Wales]|isbn=1907828001}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Clarke |first1=Andy |last2=Holzschlag|first2=Molly E.|title=Transcending CSS: the fine art of web design|url=https://archive.org/details/transcendingcssf0000clar |url-access=registration |date=2007|publisher=New Riders|location=Berkeley, Calif.|isbn=0321410971}}\n*{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1076/digc.13.4.193.8672| issn = 1462-6268| volume = 13| issue = 4| pages = 193\u2013211| last = Engholm| first = Ida| title = Digital Style History: The Development of Graphic Design on the Internet| journal = Digital Creativity| date = 2002-12-01| ref={{sfnRef|Engholm}}}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Kennedy|first1=Helen|title=Net Work: Ethics and Values in Web Design|date=December 15, 2011|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=0230231373|ref={{sfnRef|Kennedy}}}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Keith|first1=Jeremy|title=Bulletproof Ajax|date=2007|publisher=New Riders|location=Berkeley, Calif.|isbn=0321472667|edition=[Online Ed.].|url=https://archive.org/details/bulletproofajax0000keit}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Shea|first1=Dave|last2=Holzschlag|first2=Molly E.|title=The Zen of CSS design: visual enlightenment for the web|date=2005|publisher=New Riders/Peachpit Press|location=Berkeley, CA|isbn=9780321303479|url=https://archive.org/details/zenofcssdesignvi00shea}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Stocks|first1=Elliot Jay|last2=Whitaker|first2=Keir|title=Insites: the book|date=2012|publisher=Viewport Industries|isbn=0957390505}}\n\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.zeldman.com/ Jeffrey Zeldman Presents]\n* [http://www.zeldman.com/about/#articles List of Select Publications]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Zeldman, Jeffrey}}\n[[Category:1955 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:American male bloggers]]\n[[Category:American bloggers]]\n[[Category:American designers]]\n[[Category:American men podcasters]]\n[[Category:American podcasters]]\n[[Category:American publishers (people)]]\n[[Category:American technology writers]]\n[[Category:American graphic designers]]\n[[Category:Internet pioneers]]\n[[Category:Businesspeople from New York City]]\n[[Category:Web designers]]\n[[Category:Web developers]]\n[[Category:Indiana University alumni]]\n[[Category:University of Virginia alumni]]\n[[Category:21st-century American non-fiction writers]]\n", "name_user": "Rosso Robot", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eInnovations:+ Blue Beanie Day", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Zeldman"}
