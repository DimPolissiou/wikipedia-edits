It is part of the [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania]] [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. The population was 428 at the 2000 census.  Stoystown is located SSE of [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania|Johnstown]] and northeast of [[Somerset, Pennsylvania|Somerset]].\n\n==History==\nDaniel Stoy was one of the first settlers west of the mountains. From the records of Harmon Husband, we find that Stoy lived along the Forbes Road about 1762 near the Casper Stotler place in Shade Township, that he made his living by hunting, and that he was driven from his cabin home several times by the Indians, taking refuge at Fort Bedford. The records of Husband state that on one occasion Stoy shot an Indian intruder from his cabin door. With the construction of the Pennsylvania Road, Stoy decided to move to a place about ten miles farther west along the road where he received a warrant for more than three hundred acres of land. Here on this tract of land along the Pennsylvania Road, he founded the town of Stoystown in 1774. Stoy served as a volunteer in the Revolutionary War with the rank of corporal. It is thought that he also served in the French and Indian War, although the records are rather vague. Henry was born in 1747. Married Sally Stoy, daughter of Daniel M. Stoy, who sold lots and laid out the town of Stoystown about 1800, one of the oldest towns in Somerset Co., PA... Daniel M. Stoy served as captain in Gen. George Washington's army for 12 months. He was discharged at Long Island, NY., July 1778. Later he moved to what is now Somerset Co., PA. He was a Justice of the Peace. He served in the General Assembly in 1809-10 and 13. He died 1834. D.A.R. marker on grave. Daniel Stoy, born in England, May 3, 1738, died Jan 11, 1835, in Stoystown, Somerset Co., PA. He was married about 1759 to Sarah Higgins of Scotland, born April 4, 1737 died Oct 31, 1818. Soon after their marriage they came to America and located at Conchohockin, PA., where their six children were born, viz., (1) Sarah (Sally), the oldest daughter, married Henry Beaver; (2)Daniel married a Miss Shedrick; (3)Ned never married; (4) John married Elizabeth Pisel; (5) William; (6) Margaret, the youngest child, born at Conchohockin, Oct 15, 1780, died Dec. 6, 1868. She was 7 years old when her parents moved to what was then Bedford Co., now Somerset Co., PA. She married Abraham Spangler and they had 14 children. Henry Beaver moved his family from Stoystown, PA to Greensburg, Westmoreland Co., PA. They had one son that we know of, John F. Beaver, who read law at Greensburg, PA.

The borough is located within a 2{{frac|1|2}}-mile radius and provides services for a population of 927 residents. Stockertown is at the hub of five surrounding second-class townships, and until the Charles Chrin Interchange was built near [[Tatamy, PA|Tatamy]] in 2015, provided the closest access to [[Pennsylvania Route 33]] for many industrial parks in these townships.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mcall.com/news/local/easton/mc-route-33-new-interchange-20150620-story.html|title=New Route 33 interchange will drive change in Northampton County|accessdate=2015-08-20}}</ref>  Since 2006, [[Forks Township, PA|Forks Township]] has been contracted to provide fire services to the borough,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.forksfire.com/AboutUs/tabid/83/Default.aspx|title=About the Forks Township Fire Department|accessdate=2008-12-30}}</ref> and the borough maintains its own police department.

That petition was granted and, early in 1901, the Borough government was organized.\n\nIn 1906, a cement plant (which later became [[Hercules Cement]]) was constructed as ''The Nazareth Works of Atlantic Portland Cement Company''.  It acquired the name of Hercules Cement Company in 1916 after its holdings after Atlantic Portland Cement filed for bankruptcy.  It has changed owners many times through mergers, and as of 2008 is owned by [[Buzzi Unicem]].\n\nLiberty Hose Fire Company #1 formed in 1922, and the borough bought their first firetruck in 1925.  After [[World War II]], Liberty Hose opted to build a memorial in honor of the war's veterans.  The building became the borough's Memorial Hall.  In the late 1990s, Liberty Hose moved from its original building on [[State Route 2025 (Northampton County, Pennsylvania)|Main Street]] to a new facility along State Street.  This building is now the home to Stockertown's police offices and other emergency vehicles.  In 2006, Liberty Hose Fire Company was disbanded.\n\nThe freeway now known as [[Pennsylvania Route 33|Route 33]], which runs through Stockertown, began construction in 1959 from [[Wind Gap, Pennsylvania|Wind Gap]] to Saylorsburg.  Meetings were first held with residents of Stockertown in the mid 1960s, and the Stockertown portion of the highway was constructed in 1971, opening in 1972.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pahighways.com/state/PA1-50.html|title=Pennsylvania Highways: PA 1-50|accessdate=2008-10-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=LoPresti |first=Virginia |authorlink= |editor= |others= |title=History of the Borough of Stockertown to 1976 |url= |format= |date=May 1976 |publisher=Stockertown Borough Council |location=Stockertown, PA |pages=29\u201330}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1880= 143\n|1910= 426\n|1920= 432\n|1930= 602\n|1940= 729\n|1950= 757\n|1960= 777\n|1970= 753\n|1980= 661\n|1990= 641\n|2000= 687\n|2010= 927\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=923\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=February 23, 2020}}</ref>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref name=\"USDecennialCensus\">{{cite web|title=Census of Population and Housing|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|access-date=11 December 2013|df=}}</ref><ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|access-date=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref><ref name=CensusPopEst>{{cite web|title=Incorporated Places and Minor Civil Divisions Datasets: Subcounty Resident Population Estimates: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|work=Population Estimates|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|access-date=11 December 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611010502/http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|archive-date=June 11, 2013|df=}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2010, there were 927 people, up from 687 in 2000.

Pennsylvania|Northampton County]], [[Pennsylvania]], United States.  It is located in the [[Lehigh Valley]] region of the state.\n\nThe small borough contains large industries such as [[Hercules Cement]], Polymer Products, and [[Praxair]]. The borough is located within a 2{{frac|1|2}}-mile radius and provides services for a population of 927 residents. Stockertown is at the hub of five surrounding second-class townships, and until the Charles Chrin Interchange was built near [[Tatamy, PA|Tatamy]] in 2015, provided the closest access to [[Pennsylvania Route 33]] for many industrial parks in these townships.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mcall.com/news/local/easton/mc-route-33-new-interchange-20150620-story.html|title=New Route 33 interchange will drive change in Northampton County|accessdate=2015-08-20}}</ref>  Since 2006, [[Forks Township, PA|Forks Township]] has been contracted to provide fire services to the borough,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.forksfire.com/AboutUs/tabid/83/Default.aspx|title=About the Forks Township Fire Department|accessdate=2008-12-30}}</ref> and the borough maintains its own police department.

That petition was granted and, early in 1901, the Borough government was organized.\n\nIn 1906, a cement plant (which later became [[Hercules Cement]]) was constructed as ''The Nazareth Works of Atlantic Portland Cement Company''.  It acquired the name of Hercules Cement Company in 1916 after its holdings after Atlantic Portland Cement filed for bankruptcy.  It has changed owners many times through mergers, and as of 2008 is owned by [[Buzzi Unicem]].\n\nLiberty Hose Fire Company #1 formed in 1922, and the borough bought their first firetruck in 1925.  After [[World War II]], Liberty Hose opted to build a memorial in honor of the war's veterans.  The building became the borough's Memorial Hall.  In the late 1990s, Liberty Hose moved from its original building on [[State Route 2025 (Northampton County, Pennsylvania)|Main Street]] to a new facility along State Street.  This building is now the home to Stockertown's police offices and other emergency vehicles.  In 2006, Liberty Hose Fire Company was disbanded.\n\nThe freeway now known as [[Pennsylvania Route 33|Route 33]], which runs through Stockertown, began construction in 1959 from [[Wind Gap, Pennsylvania|Wind Gap]] to Saylorsburg.  Meetings were first held with residents of Stockertown in the mid 1960s, and the Stockertown portion of the highway was constructed in 1971, opening in 1972.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pahighways.com/state/PA1-50.html|title=Pennsylvania Highways: PA 1-50|accessdate=2008-10-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=LoPresti |first=Virginia |authorlink= |editor= |others= |title=History of the Borough of Stockertown to 1976 |url= |format= |date=May 1976 |publisher=Stockertown Borough Council |location=Stockertown, PA |pages=29\u201330}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1880= 143\n|1910= 426\n|1920= 432\n|1930= 602\n|1940= 729\n|1950= 757\n|1960= 777\n|1970= 753\n|1980= 661\n|1990= 641\n|2000= 687\n|2010= 927\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=923\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=February 23, 2020}}</ref>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref name=\"USDecennialCensus\">{{cite web|title=Census of Population and Housing|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|access-date=11 December 2013|df=}}</ref><ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|access-date=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref><ref name=CensusPopEst>{{cite web|title=Incorporated Places and Minor Civil Divisions Datasets: Subcounty Resident Population Estimates: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|work=Population Estimates|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|access-date=11 December 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611010502/http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|archive-date=June 11, 2013|df=}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2010, there were 927 people, up from 687 in 2000.

Pennsylvania|Lackawanna County]], [[Pennsylvania]], adjoining [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]].  Formerly, coal mining and silk manufacturing provided employment for the people of Throop, who numbered 2,204 in 1900 and 5,133 in 1910.  In 1940, 7,382 people lived in Throop, Pennsylvania.  The population was 4,088 at the 2010 census.\n\n==Geography==\nThroop is located at {{Coord|41|26|44|N|75|36|52|W|type:city}} (41.445536, -75.614494).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the borough has a total area of {{convert|5.0|sqmi|km2}}, all of it land.  Its border meets neighboring towns, including: Olyphant, Dickson City, Dunmore, and Scranton.\n\n==History and notable features==\nOn April 7, 1911, a fire at the Price-Pancoast Colliery killed 72 coal miners in what has been described as \"the most appalling mine disaster in the history of the northern anthracite coal fields\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://throopboro.com/site/|title=Throop Boro|website=throopboro.com}}</ref>\n\nThe borough contains a lead-contaminated parcel of land commonly known as the Marjol Battery site. Now owned by [[Gould Electronics]], the empty land was a former battery processing facility closed in April 1982. Since the late 1980s, the federal [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] and the state DEP have worked to clean up contamination in adjacent areas, but a final remedy for the site itself has remained on hold in recent years, as local officials and citizens fight with the government agencies and Gould over the best solution. In the meantime, the landowner has maintained a policy of basic containment and monitoring.\n\nThroop's most popular summertime event is its annual Cow Flop organized by the Throop Booster Club. It has been a tradition in Throop since the late 1980s.  The Flop serves as a fundraiser for the club and usually raises about $10,000 annually to benefit youth baseball and softball programs in the borough.  The Flop, formerly held on a Sunday in late June, is now a two-day (since 2007) event that features a parade, fireworks, music, food, and other entertainment.  The event requires more than 100 volunteers, mostly members of the Booster Club and parents of throop athletes, to produce.  The main event of the Cow Flop is the raffle involving 2,000 squares and a cow's pick as to where she will relieve herself.  Raffle tickets are $10 and the winner of the annual Flop raffle wins $5,000.<ref>[http://www.thetimes-tribune.com/articles/2008/06/29/top_local_stories/19813866.txt]{{dead link|date=June 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1900= 2204\n|1910= 5133\n|1920= 6672\n|1930= 8027\n|1940= 7382\n|1950= 5861\n|1960= 4732\n|1970= 4307\n|1980= 4166\n|1990= 4070\n|2000= 4010\n|2010= 4088\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=3923\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=October 22, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref name=\"USDecennialCensus\">{{cite web|title=Census of Population and Housing|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=11 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref><ref name=CensusPopEst>{{cite web|title=Incorporated Places and Minor Civil Divisions Datasets: Subcounty Resident Population Estimates: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|work=Population Estimates|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=11 December 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611010502/http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|archivedate=11 June 2013}}</ref>\n}}\n\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR8\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-05-14|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref> of 2010, there were 4,088 people, 1,778 households, and 1,122 families residing in the borough.

Pennsylvania|Lackawanna County]], [[Pennsylvania]], adjoining [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]].  Formerly, coal mining and silk manufacturing provided employment for the people of Throop, who numbered 2,204 in 1900 and 5,133 in 1910.  In 1940, 7,382 people lived in Throop, Pennsylvania.  The population was 4,088 at the 2010 census.\n\n==Geography==\nThroop is located at {{Coord|41|26|44|N|75|36|52|W|type:city}} (41.445536, -75.614494).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the borough has a total area of {{convert|5.0|sqmi|km2}}, all of it land.  Its border meets neighboring towns, including: Olyphant, Dickson City, Dunmore, and Scranton.\n\n==History and notable features==\nOn April 7, 1911, a fire at the Price-Pancoast Colliery killed 72 coal miners in what has been described as \"the most appalling mine disaster in the history of the northern anthracite coal fields\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://throopboro.com/site/|title=Throop Boro|website=throopboro.com}}</ref>\n\nThe borough contains a lead-contaminated parcel of land commonly known as the Marjol Battery site. Now owned by [[Gould Electronics]], the empty land was a former battery processing facility closed in April 1982. Since the late 1980s, the federal [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] and the state DEP have worked to clean up contamination in adjacent areas, but a final remedy for the site itself has remained on hold in recent years, as local officials and citizens fight with the government agencies and Gould over the best solution. In the meantime, the landowner has maintained a policy of basic containment and monitoring.\n\nThroop's most popular summertime event is its annual Cow Flop organized by the Throop Booster Club. It has been a tradition in Throop since the late 1980s.  The Flop serves as a fundraiser for the club and usually raises about $10,000 annually to benefit youth baseball and softball programs in the borough.  The Flop, formerly held on a Sunday in late June, is now a two-day (since 2007) event that features a parade, fireworks, music, food, and other entertainment.  The event requires more than 100 volunteers, mostly members of the Booster Club and parents of throop athletes, to produce.  The main event of the Cow Flop is the raffle involving 2,000 squares and a cow's pick as to where she will relieve herself.  Raffle tickets are $10 and the winner of the annual Flop raffle wins $5,000.<ref>[http://www.thetimes-tribune.com/articles/2008/06/29/top_local_stories/19813866.txt]{{deadlink|date=June 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1900= 2204\n|1910= 5133\n|1920= 6672\n|1930= 8027\n|1940= 7382\n|1950= 5861\n|1960= 4732\n|1970= 4307\n|1980= 4166\n|1990= 4070\n|2000= 4010\n|2010= 4088\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=3923\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=October 22, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref name=\"USDecennialCensus\">{{cite web|title=Census of Population and Housing|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=11 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref><ref name=CensusPopEst>{{cite web|title=Incorporated Places and Minor Civil Divisions Datasets: Subcounty Resident Population Estimates: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|work=Population Estimates|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=11 December 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611010502/http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|archivedate=11 June 2013}}</ref>\n}}\n\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR8\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-05-14|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref> of 2010, there were 4,088 people, 1,778 households, and 1,122 families residing in the borough.
