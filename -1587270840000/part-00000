It was filmed on March 25 and 26, 2020 and broadcast as a two-night event on April 4 and 5, marking the first time the event was broadcast over two nights as well as aired on [[Broadcast delay|tape delay]]. On PPV, the two productions were sold as individual shows, with both available as a [[Product bundling|package deal]].\n\nThe event was originally scheduled to take place solely on April 5, 2020, at [[Raymond James Stadium]] in [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], [[Florida]] and was to air live. In mid-March 2020, all WWE programming was relocated to the [[WWE Performance Center]] training facility in [[Orlando]] due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], with [[Behind closed doors (sport)|no audience]] and only essential staff present and air across two nights. The majority of its matches were pre-recorded at the Performance Center between March 25 and 26. Taking advantage of the format, two matches \u2014 a \"[[Buried Alive match|Boneyard match]]\" and a \"Firefly Fun House match\" \u2014 were filmed off-site in atypical, [[filmmaking|cinematic]] style.\n\nThe card comprised nineteen matches which were divided between the two nights, including one match on each night's Kickoff pre-show and a [[Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms#dark_match|dark match]] on the second night. In the main event for Part 1, [[The Undertaker]], returning to his \"American Bad Ass\" gimmick, defeated [[AJ Styles]] in a Boneyard match. In other prominent matches, [[Braun Strowman]] defeated [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]] to win the [[WWE Universal Championship|Universal Championship]], [[Becky Lynch]] defeated [[Shayna Baszler]] to retain the [[Raw Women's Championship]], and [[Kevin Owens]] defeated [[Seth Rollins]] in a [[No Disqualification match]]. In the main event for Part 2, [[Drew McIntyre]]  defeated [[Brock Lesnar]] to win the [[WWE Championship]], after which, McIntyre retained the title in an impromptu dark match against [[Big Show]] (which was shown on the April 6 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]''). In other prominent matches, [[Bray Wyatt|\"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt]] defeated [[John Cena]] in a Firefly Fun House match, [[Charlotte Flair]] defeated [[Rhea Ripley]] to win the [[NXT Women's Championship]] for a second time, which was the first time an NXT championship was defended at the event, [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] defeated [[Randy Orton]] in a [[Last Man Standing match]], which was Edge's first singles match since 2011, and [[Otis Dozovic|Otis]] defeated [[Dolph Ziggler]].\n\nWrestleMania 36 received mostly positive reactions from fans and critics. While it was noted that the event suffered from the absence of a live audience and a poor lead-up (partly due to a number of wrestlers being pulled from the event shortly before its filming, mostly in relation to the pandemic, including [[Roman Reigns]], [[The Miz]], [[Andrade (wrestler)|Andrade]], and [[Dana Brooke]], all of whom were slated to defend or challenge for championships), most felt that WWE exceeded expectations. The Boneyard and Firefly Fun House matches were singled out as highlights due to their uniqueness and over-the-top tone.\n\n==Production==\n===Background===\n[[WrestleMania]] is considered [[WWE]]'s flagship event, having first been held in [[WrestleMania I|1985]].

The climax saw Cesaro perform a U.F.O. on Gulak, followed by a pin to win the match.<ref name=\"preWM36Part1\"/>\n\n====Preliminary matches====\nThe actual pay-per-view portion of Part 1 opened with host Rob Gronkowski hyping WrestleMania, who was then joined by his friend [[Mojo Rawley]].<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn the first match, The Kabuki Warriors ([[Asuka (wrestler)|Asuka]] and [[Kairi Sane]]) defended the [[WWE Women's Tag Team Championship]] against [[Alexa Bliss]] and [[Nikki Cross]]. In the end, Cross performed The Purge on Sane followed by Bliss performing a Twisted Bliss to win and become the first two-time champions in the titles' history.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nNext, [[Elias (wrestler)|Elias]] faced [[Baron Corbin|King Corbin]]. In the end, as Corbin attempted a pin on Elias with his legs on the rope, the referee noticed it and voided the pin; Elias then performed a roll-up on a distracted Corbin, who was arguing with the referee, to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nAfter that, Becky Lynch defended the Raw Women's Championship against Shayna Baszler. In the closing moments, as Baszler applied the Kirifuda Clutch on Lynch, Lynch countered into a roll-up to retain the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn the fourth match, [[Sami Zayn]] (accompanied by Cesaro and [[Shinsuke Nakamura]]) defended the Intercontinental Championship against [[Daniel Bryan]] (accompanied by Drew Gulak). In the first half of the match, Zayn refused to face Bryan and continuously scurried away from him. Bryan would run after Zayn only for Cesaro and Nakamura to get in his way. This led to Gulak getting involved and temporarily taking out Cesaro and Nakamura. As Zayn wanted a countout victory, Bryan brought Zayn back into the ring and eventually started to perform his offensive attacks on him. In the end, Cesaro and Nakamura recovered and attacked Gulak. As Bryan attempted a slam on Zayn, Zayn performed a Helluva Kick in mid-air to retain the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nNext, the SmackDown Tag Team Championship was defended in a Triple Threat Ladder match. The match was originally scheduled as a tag team Triple Threat Ladder match in which The Miz and John Morrison were to defend the title against [[The New Day (professional wrestling)|The New Day]] ([[Big E (wrestler)|Big E]] and Kofi Kingston) and [[The Usos]] (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso), but due to The Miz becoming ill, the match was contested between Morrison, Jimmy, and Kingston, each representing their respective team. In the end, all three competitors, who were atop ladders, managed to unhook the gold hook with the titles still intact. After a scuffle, Jimmy and Kingston performed a headbutt on Morrison, who fell down atop a ladder wedged between the rope and a second ladder. As Morrison fell, he grasped the titles, unhooking them as he fell, thus Morrison retained the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nAfter that, Kevin Owens faced Seth Rollins. The match ended via a disqualification win for Owens, as Rollins attacked him with the ring bell. Owens then taunted Rollins to face him again in a [[No Disqualification match]], which was accepted. During the match, Owens attacked Rollins with the ring bell and performed a diving elbow drop off the WrestleMania sign. In the end, Owens performed a Stunner on Rollins to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn a small segment, [[WWE 24/7 Championship|24/7 Champion]] [[R-Truth]] joined Gronkowski and Rawley, who were standing atop a viewing podium.

As Strowman attempted a Running Powerslam on Goldberg, Goldberg countered and performed three Spears for a near fall. Goldberg then performed a fourth Spear on Strowman. As Goldberg attempted the Jackhammer, Strowman countered and performed four Running Powerslams on Goldberg to win the title for the first time, as well as his first world championship.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event of Part 1, The Undertaker faced AJ Styles in a Boneyard match, which was a [[Buried Alive match]] set at an undisclosed [[cemetery]] and warehouse in the Orlando area. A hearse arrived at the cemetery to The Undertaker's theme music, however, Styles emerged from the casket. The Undertaker then arrived riding a motorcycle (reminiscent of his [[The Undertaker#American Bad Ass (2000\u20132001)|\"American Bad Ass\" gimmick]]) to the tune of [[Metallica]]'s \"[[Now That We're Dead]]\". Halfway through the match, Styles' O.C. teammates Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson appeared in an attempt to assist Styles, but The Undertaker fought them off. The Undertaker then fought a group of druids before Styles gained the upper hand again. Styles attacked Undertaker with a spade which caused Undertaker to fall in the grave. As Styles was preparing to drop dirt on Undertaker to bury him and win, Undertaker appeared behind Styles and started to attack him. Undertaker and Styles fought all over the graveyard and atop the warehouse rooftop. Undertaker then fought Gallows and Anderson on the rooftop. He then threw Gallows off the rooftop, performed a Tombstone Piledriver on Anderson, and chokeslammed Styles off the rooftop. Undertaker then threw Styles into the grave, started the tractor, and dumped all the dirt in the grave to win the match. Following the match, as the camera panned on the grave, Styles' hand was sticking out from the dirt, while Undertaker then departed on his motorcycle, again to the Metallica song.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n===<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->Part 2<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->===\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+'''Other on-screen personnel \u2013 Part 2'''\n!|Role\n!|Name\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Hosts\n|[[Rob Gronkowski]]\n|-\n|[[Titus O'Neil]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|English Commentators\n|[[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Tom Phillips (wrestling)|Tom Phillips]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|[[Byron Saxton]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|Spanish commentator\n|[[Carlos Cabrera]]<ref name=\"Spanishannouncers\"/>\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Ring announcers\n|Greg Hamilton {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Mike Rome]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|rowspan=\"7\"|Referees\n|Danilo Anfibio\n|-\n|Shawn Bennett\n|-\n|[[John Cone]]\n|-\n|Darrick Moore\n|-\n|Eddie Orengo\n|-\n|[[Charles Robinson (referee)|Charles Robinson]]\n|-\n|[[Drake Younger|Drake Wuertz]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Interviewers\n|Charly Caruso\n|-\n|Kayla Braxton\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Pre-show panel\n|[[Corey Graves]]\n|-\n|[[Peter Rosenberg]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Pre-show correspondents\n|[[Renee Young]]\n|-\n|[[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]]\n|-\n|[[Christian (wrestler)|Christian]]\n|}\n\n====Pre-show====\nDuring the WrestleMania 36 Kickoff Part 2 pre-show, [[Liv Morgan]] faced [[Natalya Neidhart|Natalya]]. In the end, Morgan pinned Natalya with a roll-up to win the match.<ref name=\"preWM36Part2\"/>\n\n====Preliminary matches====\nThe actual pay-per-view portion of Part 2 opened with Rhea Ripley defending the NXT Women's Championship against Charlotte Flair. In the climax, After a back-and-forth match, Flair forced Ripley to tap out to the Figure-Eight Leglock to win the title for a second time \u2013 and the first time since [[NXT TakeOver (2014)|NXT TakeOver]] in 2014. Flair also became the first wrestler to win an NXT championship before and after NXT became one of WWE's three main brands.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nNext, Aleister Black faced [[Bobby Lashley]] (accompanied by [[Lana (wrestler)|Lana]]). In the end, as Lashley attempted a Spear on Black, Black performed a Black Mass on Lashley to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nAfter that, Otis faced Dolph Ziggler (accompanied by Sonya Deville). In the closing moments, as Otis attempted to perform the Caterpillar on Ziggler, Deville distracted Otis on the ring apron, which allowed Ziggler to attack Otis with a low blow from behind. Deville's tag team partner, Mandy Rose, came out and attacked Deville. With the referee distracted, Rose also performed a low blow on Ziggler. Otis then performed the Caterpillar on Ziggler to win the match. Following the match, Otis and Rose shared a kiss in the ring.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nIn the fourth match, Edge faced Randy Orton in a Last Man Standing match. As Edge waited for Orton to make his entrance, Orton \u2013 who had been disguised as a cameraman \u2013 attacked Edge from behind with an RKO. Orton then attacked Edge with a second RKO and a camera, but Edge rose to his feet. Edge and Orton then fought in the Performance Center's gym area, where Orton placed Edge's arms in a sling and proceeded to attack him. As Orton attempted to attack Edge with a weight, Edge performed a dropkick on him. The two then fought back to the ringside area, where Orton threw Edge into a barricade off a raised platform. After fighting all throughout the Performance Center, they eventually fought atop a production truck where Edge performed a spear on Orton and Orton performed an RKO on Edge. In the end, Edge applied a sleeper hold on Orton, who passed out on a chair. A conflicted Edge then performed the Conchairto on Orton. Edge won the match after Orton was unable to answer the referee's 10 count.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nNext, The Street Profits (Angelo Dawkins and Montez Ford) defended the Raw Tag Team Championship against Angel Garza and Austin Theory (with Zelina Vega). In the closing moments, Ford performed a Springboard Frogsplash on Theory, who was then pinned by Dawkins. After the match, Garza, Theory, and Vega attacked the Street Profits. NXT's [[Bianca Belair]] then ran out and attacked Vega, clearing the ring.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nIn a small segment, new 24/7 Champion Mojo Rawley ran away from multiple wrestlers into the Performance Center. They cornered Rawley near the podium host Rob Gronkowski was standing on. Gronkowski witnessed this and performed a dive on top of the wrestlers. Gronkowski then pinned Rawley to win the 24/7 Championship.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nAfter that, Bayley defended the SmackDown Women's Championship in a fatal five-way elimination match against Sasha Banks, Lacey Evans, Naomi, and Tamina. Tamina was the first eliminated after all the other wrestlers piled on top of her for the pin. Banks applied the Bank Statement on Naomi to eliminate her. As Bayley attempted a dropkick on Evans in the corner, Evans moved out of the way and Bayley attacked Banks instead. After Bayley tried apologizing, Bayley pushed Banks out of the way of an attack from Evans, who performed the Woman's Right on Banks to eliminate her. Bayley did not attempt to break up the pin to save Banks. In the end, as Evans was about to perform the Woman's Right on Bayley, Banks returned to the ring and performed a Backstabber on Evans. Bayley then performed a DDT on Evans to retain the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nThe penultimate match was the Firefly Fun House match between John Cena and \"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt. Cena came out for his match in the Performance Center, assuming his match was taking place in the ring. Wyatt was then shown in the Firefly Fun House, stating that Cena would actually be facing himself before exiting through the fun house's door. Cena was then teleported to the Firefly Fun House. After also going through the door, Cena was transported through a series of [[dream sequence]]s where Wyatt demonstrated his perceived personality flaws (such as being a bully who did not have to work for his achievements like Wyatt did), including his debut appearance on ''SmackDown'' (with Wyatt acting as [[Kurt Angle]], and Cena seemingly unable to say anything but \"[[History of WWE#Ruthless Aggression Era (2002-2008)|ruthless aggression]]\"), and a spoof of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event]]'' (where Wyatt introduced Cena as his tag team partner \"Johnny Largemeat\", who was tired out from repeatedly lifting weights). Appearing as his old [[The Wyatt Family|Wyatt Family]] self, Wyatt then reminisced about his loss to Cena at [[WrestleMania XXX]], and pledged to right his previous wrong. Back in a ring, Cena reversed out of an attempted Sister Abigail by Wyatt, and was (as in that previous match) coerced into using a chair against him. However, as he did so, Wyatt disappeared, and Cena was suddenly transported to ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|nWo Monday Nitro]]''\u2014with Cena acting as [[Hulk Hogan|\"Hollywood\" Hulk Hogan]] and Wyatt acting as [[Eric Bischoff]]. In the ring, Cena tackled Wyatt. After a fury of fists, Wyatt disappeared and was replaced by the Huskus the Pig Boy puppet. The Fiend then snuck up from behind and performed Sister Abigail and the Mandible Claw on Cena to win the match, with Wyatt's normal self counting the pin. Just before The Fiend performed Sister Abigail, the audio of Cena's promo from ''SmackDown'' was played, where Cena had stated that at WrestleMania, he would end the existence of the \"most over hyped, over valued, over privileged WWE Superstar\".<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbssports.com/wwe/news/wwe-wrestlemania-36-results-firefly-funhouse-boneyard-matches-lead-best-moments-from-surreal-2020-show/|title=WWE WrestleMania 36 results: Firefly FunHouse, Boneyard matches lead best moments from surreal 2020 show|website=CBSSports.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://africa.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/28997784/wwe-wrestlemania-36-live-results-recaps-analysis|title=WrestleMania 36: McIntyre stops Lesnar, Gronk wins 24/7 title|date=2020-04-05|website=ESPN.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event of Part 2, Brock Lesnar (accompanied by [[Paul Heyman]]) defended the WWE Championship against Drew McIntyre. McIntyre started off with a Claymore Kick on Lesnar for a nearfall. Lesnar performed three German suplexes and an F-5, but McIntyre kicked out at one. Lesnar then performed two more F-5's, both of which again resulted in nearfalls. As Lesnar went for a fourth F-5, McIntyre countered and performed three more Claymore Kicks on Lesnar to win the title, capturing his first world championship in WWE.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/> and becoming the first-ever British-born world champion in WWE history, as well as WWE's thirty-first [[Triple_Crown_(professional_wrestling)#WWE|Triple Crown]] champion. After the show went off the air, McIntyre was confronted by [[Big Show]], who McIntyre then faced in a title defense described by WWE as the \"hidden WrestleMania main event.\"<ref>{{cite tweet |author=WWE WrestleMania|user=WrestleMania|number=1247357532789768194|date=April 6, 2020 |title=Your hidden #WrestleMania main event has been unlocked. #WWERaw @WWETheBigShow @DMcIntyreWWE |access-date=April 7, 2020}}</ref> McIntyre performed a Claymore Kick on Big Show to retain the title.

While most agreed that WrestleMania 36 suffered from both a poor lead-up and the absence of a live audience, many felt that the event exceeded expectations, with both critics and fans largely praising the Boneyard and Firefly Fun House matches as the best of the event for their uniqueness and over-the-top tone (and in the case of the latter, its inventiveness and humor); the SmackDown Tag Team Championship match and Owens vs. Rollins were also singled out by most critics.<ref name=\"HollywoodReporterReview\">{{Cite web |last=Szalai |first=Georg |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/how-wwe-pulled-wrestlemania-36-fans-business-impact-1288659 |title=How WWE Pulled Off WrestleMania 36 Without Fans and What It Means for Its Business and Future |publisher=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=April 6, 2020 |accessdate=April 8, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"SlateReview\">{{Cite web |last=Bixenspan |first=David |url=https://slate.com/culture/2020/04/wrestlemania-36-no-fans-audience-coronavirus-undertaker-john-cena.html |title=WrestleMania Still Happened Last Weekend.

Club]]'' gave the event a B\u2013. While praising WWE for making the most out of its \"weirdest WrestleMania of all time\", particularly praising the Boneyard match, he did point out that most matches suffered from its poor lead-up and lack of live audience, stating notably that Becky Lynch and Shayna Baszler's match was \"a listless and too-short battle that, when you consider the response both performers tend to extract from crowds, might have shifted into another gear in a packed stadium.\" He also cited examples of \"shoddy storytelling\", noting that it \"[was] great that Braun Strowman beat the snot out of Goldberg, but it might have resonated more if the company hadn't just had the 53-year old Goldberg destroy The Fiend, a heretofore untouchable star, during a [[Super ShowDown (2020)| PPV in Saudi Arabia]]\u2014and, you know, done anything with Braun over the past few years.\"<ref name=\"AVCReview\">{{Cite web |last=Colbrun |first=Randall |url=https://tv.avclub.com/the-weirdest-wrestlemania-of-all-time-at-least-figured-1842699373 |title=The Weirdest Wrestlemania of All Time at Least Figured Out How to Use Its Legends |work=[[The A.

Others decided to play to a crowd that wasn't actually there.

It was filmed on March 25 and 26, 2020 and broadcast as a two-night event on April 4 and 5, marking the first time the event was broadcast over two nights as well as aired on [[Broadcast delay|tape delay]]. On PPV, the two productions were sold as individual shows, with both available as a [[Product bundling|package deal]].\n\nThe event was originally scheduled to take place solely on April 5, 2020, at [[Raymond James Stadium]] in [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], [[Florida]] and was to air live. In mid-March 2020, all WWE programming was relocated to the [[WWE Performance Center]] training facility in [[Orlando]] due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], with [[Behind closed doors (sport)|no audience]] and only essential staff present and air across two nights. The majority of its matches were pre-recorded at the Performance Center between March 25 and 26. Taking advantage of the format, two matches \u2014 a \"[[Buried Alive match|Boneyard match]]\" and a \"Firefly Fun House match\" \u2014 were filmed off-site in atypical, [[filmmaking|cinematic]] style.\n\nThe card comprised nineteen matches which were divided between the two nights, including one match on each night's Kickoff pre-show and a [[Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms#dark_match|dark match]] on the second night. In the main event for Part 1, [[The Undertaker]], returning to his \"American Bad Ass\" gimmick, defeated [[AJ Styles]] in a Boneyard match. In other prominent matches, [[Braun Strowman]] defeated [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]] to win the [[WWE Universal Championship|Universal Championship]], [[Becky Lynch]] defeated [[Shayna Baszler]] to retain the [[Raw Women's Championship]], and [[Kevin Owens]] defeated [[Seth Rollins]] in a [[No Disqualification match]]. In the main event for Part 2, [[Drew McIntyre]]  defeated [[Brock Lesnar]] to win the [[WWE Championship]], after which, McIntyre retained the title in an impromptu dark match against [[Big Show]] (which was shown on the April 6 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]''). In other prominent matches, [[Bray Wyatt|\"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt]] defeated [[John Cena]] in a Firefly Fun House match, [[Charlotte Flair]] defeated [[Rhea Ripley]] to win the [[NXT Women's Championship]] for a second time, which was the first time an NXT championship was defended at the event, [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] defeated [[Randy Orton]] in a [[Last Man Standing match]], which was Edge's first singles match since 2011, and [[Otis Dozovic|Otis]] defeated [[Dolph Ziggler]].\n\nWrestleMania 36 received mostly positive reactions from fans and critics. While it was noted that the event suffered from the absence of a live audience and a poor lead-up (partly due to a number of wrestlers being pulled from the event shortly before its filming, mostly in relation to the pandemic, including [[Roman Reigns]], [[The Miz]], [[Andrade (wrestler)|Andrade]], and [[Dana Brooke]], all of whom were slated to defend or challenge for championships), most felt that WWE exceeded expectations. The Boneyard and Firefly Fun House matches were singled out as highlights due to their uniqueness and over-the-top tone.\n\n==Production==\n===Background===\n[[WrestleMania]] is considered [[WWE]]'s flagship event, having first been held in [[WrestleMania I|1985]].

The climax saw Cesaro perform a U.F.O. on Gulak, followed by a pin to win the match.<ref name=\"preWM36Part1\"/>\n\n====Preliminary matches====\nThe actual pay-per-view portion of Part 1 opened with host Rob Gronkowski hyping WrestleMania, who was then joined by his friend [[Mojo Rawley]].<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn the first match, The Kabuki Warriors ([[Asuka (wrestler)|Asuka]] and [[Kairi Sane]]) defended the [[WWE Women's Tag Team Championship]] against [[Alexa Bliss]] and [[Nikki Cross]].

In the end, as Corbin attempted a pin on Elias with his legs on the rope, the referee noticed it and voided the pin; Elias then performed a roll-up on a distracted Corbin, who was arguing with the referee, to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nAfter that, Becky Lynch defended the Raw Women's Championship against Shayna Baszler. In the closing moments, as Baszler applied the Kirifuda Clutch on Lynch, Lynch countered into a roll-up to retain the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn the fourth match, [[Sami Zayn]] (accompanied by Cesaro and [[Shinsuke Nakamura]]) defended the Intercontinental Championship against [[Daniel Bryan]] (accompanied by Drew Gulak). In the first half of the match, Zayn refused to face Bryan and continuously scurried away from him. Bryan would run after Zayn only for Cesaro and Nakamura to get in his way. This led to Gulak getting involved and temporarily taking out Cesaro and Nakamura. As Zayn wanted a countout victory, Bryan brought Zayn back into the ring and eventually started to perform his offensive attacks on him. In the end, Cesaro and Nakamura recovered and attacked Gulak. As Bryan attempted a slam on Zayn, Zayn performed a Helluva Kick in mid-air to retain the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nNext, the SmackDown Tag Team Championship was defended in a Triple Threat Ladder match. The match was originally scheduled as a tag team Triple Threat Ladder match in which The Miz and John Morrison were to defend the title against [[The New Day (professional wrestling)|The New Day]] ([[Big E (wrestler)|Big E]] and Kofi Kingston) and [[The Usos]] (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso), but due to The Miz becoming ill, the match was contested between Morrison, Jimmy, and Kingston, each representing their respective team. In the end, all three competitors, who were atop ladders, managed to unhook the gold hook with the titles still intact. After a scuffle, Jimmy and Kingston performed a headbutt on Morrison, who fell down atop a ladder wedged between the rope and a second ladder. As Morrison fell, he grasped the titles, unhooking them as he fell, thus Morrison retained the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nAfter that, Kevin Owens faced Seth Rollins. The match ended via a disqualification win for Owens, as Rollins attacked him with the ring bell. Owens then taunted Rollins to face him again in a [[No Disqualification match]], which was accepted.

In the end, Owens performed a Stunner on Rollins to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn a small segment, [[WWE 24/7 Championship|24/7 Champion]] [[R-Truth]] joined Gronkowski and Rawley, who were standing atop a viewing podium.

A hearse arrived at the cemetery to The Undertaker's theme music, however, Styles emerged from the casket. The Undertaker then arrived riding a motorcycle (reminiscent of his [[The Undertaker#American Bad Ass (2000\u20132001)|\"American Bad Ass\" gimmick]]) to the tune of [[Metallica]]'s \"[[Now That We're Dead]]\". Halfway through the match, Styles' O.C. teammates Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson appeared in an attempt to assist Styles, but The Undertaker fought them off. The Undertaker then fought a group of druids before Styles gained the upper hand again. Styles attacked Undertaker with a spade which caused Undertaker to fall in the grave. As Styles was preparing to drop dirt on Undertaker to bury him and win, Undertaker appeared behind Styles and started to attack him. Undertaker and Styles fought all over the graveyard and atop the warehouse rooftop. Undertaker then fought Gallows and Anderson on the rooftop. He then threw Gallows off the rooftop, performed a Tombstone Piledriver on Anderson, and chokeslammed Styles off the rooftop. Undertaker then threw Styles into the grave, started the tractor, and dumped all the dirt in the grave to win the match. Following the match, as the camera panned on the grave, Styles' hand was sticking out from the dirt, while Undertaker then departed on his motorcycle, again to the Metallica song.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n===<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->Part 2<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->===\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+'''Other on-screen personnel \u2013 Part 2'''\n!|Role\n!|Name\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Hosts\n|[[Rob Gronkowski]]\n|-\n|[[Titus O'Neil]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|English Commentators\n|[[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Tom Phillips (wrestling)|Tom Phillips]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|[[Byron Saxton]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|Spanish commentator\n|[[Carlos Cabrera]]<ref name=\"Spanishannouncers\"/>\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Ring announcers\n|Greg Hamilton {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Mike Rome]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|rowspan=\"7\"|Referees\n|Danilo Anfibio\n|-\n|Shawn Bennett\n|-\n|[[John Cone]]\n|-\n|Darrick Moore\n|-\n|Eddie Orengo\n|-\n|[[Charles Robinson (referee)|Charles Robinson]]\n|-\n|[[Drake Younger|Drake Wuertz]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Interviewers\n|Charly Caruso\n|-\n|Kayla Braxton\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Pre-show panel\n|[[Corey Graves]]\n|-\n|[[Peter Rosenberg]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Pre-show correspondents\n|[[Renee Young]]\n|-\n|[[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]]\n|-\n|[[Christian (wrestler)|Christian]]\n|}\n\n====Pre-show====\nDuring the WrestleMania 36 Kickoff Part 2 pre-show, [[Liv Morgan]] faced [[Natalya Neidhart|Natalya]].

In the climax, After a back-and-forth match, Flair forced Ripley to tap out to the Figure-Eight Leglock to win the title for a second time \u2013 and the first time since [[NXT TakeOver (2014)|NXT TakeOver]] in 2014. Flair also became the first wrestler to win an NXT championship before and after NXT became one of WWE's three main brands.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nNext, Aleister Black faced [[Bobby Lashley]] (accompanied by [[Lana (wrestler)|Lana]]). In the end, as Lashley attempted a Spear on Black, Black performed a Black Mass on Lashley to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nAfter that, Otis faced Dolph Ziggler (accompanied by Sonya Deville). In the closing moments, as Otis attempted to perform the Caterpillar on Ziggler, Deville distracted Otis on the ring apron, which allowed Ziggler to attack Otis with a low blow from behind. Deville's tag team partner, Mandy Rose, came out and attacked Deville. With the referee distracted, Rose also performed a low blow on Ziggler. Otis then performed the Caterpillar on Ziggler to win the match. Following the match, Otis and Rose shared a kiss in the ring.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nIn the fourth match, Edge faced Randy Orton in a Last Man Standing match. As Edge waited for Orton to make his entrance, Orton \u2013 who had been disguised as a cameraman \u2013 attacked Edge from behind with an RKO. Orton then attacked Edge with a second RKO and a camera, but Edge rose to his feet. Edge and Orton then fought in the Performance Center's gym area, where Orton placed Edge's arms in a sling and proceeded to attack him. As Orton attempted to attack Edge with a weight, Edge performed a dropkick on him. The two then fought back to the ringside area, where Orton threw Edge into a barricade off a raised platform. After fighting all throughout the Performance Center, they eventually fought atop a production truck where Edge performed a spear on Orton and Orton performed an RKO on Edge. In the end, Edge applied a sleeper hold on Orton, who passed out on a chair. A conflicted Edge then performed the Conchairto on Orton. Edge won the match after Orton was unable to answer the referee's 10 count.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nNext, The Street Profits (Angelo Dawkins and Montez Ford) defended the Raw Tag Team Championship against Angel Garza and Austin Theory (with Zelina Vega). In the closing moments, Ford performed a Springboard Frogsplash on Theory, who was then pinned by Dawkins. After the match, Garza, Theory, and Vega attacked the Street Profits. NXT's [[Bianca Belair]] then ran out and attacked Vega, clearing the ring.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nIn a small segment, new 24/7 Champion Mojo Rawley ran away from multiple wrestlers into the Performance Center.

Tamina was the first eliminated after all the other wrestlers piled on top of her for the pin. Banks applied the Bank Statement on Naomi to eliminate her. As Bayley attempted a dropkick on Evans in the corner, Evans moved out of the way and Bayley attacked Banks instead. After Bayley tried apologizing, Bayley pushed Banks out of the way of an attack from Evans, who performed the Woman's Right on Banks to eliminate her. Bayley did not attempt to break up the pin to save Banks. In the end, as Evans was about to perform the Woman's Right on Bayley, Banks returned to the ring and performed a Backstabber on Evans. Bayley then performed a DDT on Evans to retain the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nThe penultimate match was the Firefly Fun House match between John Cena and \"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt. Cena came out for his match in the Performance Center, assuming his match was taking place in the ring. Wyatt was then shown in the Firefly Fun House, stating that Cena would actually be facing himself before exiting through the fun house's door. Cena was then teleported to the Firefly Fun House. After also going through the door, Cena was transported through a series of [[dream sequence]]s where Wyatt demonstrated his perceived personality flaws (such as being a bully who did not have to work for his achievements like Wyatt did), including his debut appearance on ''SmackDown'' (with Wyatt acting as [[Kurt Angle]], and Cena seemingly unable to say anything but \"[[History of WWE#Ruthless Aggression Era (2002-2008)|ruthless aggression]]\"), and a spoof of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event]]'' (where Wyatt introduced Cena as his tag team partner \"Johnny Largemeat\", who was tired out from repeatedly lifting weights). Appearing as his old [[The Wyatt Family|Wyatt Family]] self, Wyatt then reminisced about his loss to Cena at [[WrestleMania XXX]], and pledged to right his previous wrong. Back in a ring, Cena reversed out of an attempted Sister Abigail by Wyatt, and was (as in that previous match) coerced into using a chair against him. However, as he did so, Wyatt disappeared, and Cena was suddenly transported to ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|nWo Monday Nitro]]''\u2014with Cena acting as [[Hulk Hogan|\"Hollywood\" Hulk Hogan]] and Wyatt acting as [[Eric Bischoff]]. In the ring, Cena tackled Wyatt. After a fury of fists, Wyatt disappeared and was replaced by the Huskus the Pig Boy puppet. The Fiend then snuck up from behind and performed Sister Abigail and the Mandible Claw on Cena to win the match, with Wyatt's normal self counting the pin. Just before The Fiend performed Sister Abigail, the audio of Cena's promo from ''SmackDown'' was played, where Cena had stated that at WrestleMania, he would end the existence of the \"most over hyped, over valued, over privileged WWE Superstar\".<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbssports.com/wwe/news/wwe-wrestlemania-36-results-firefly-funhouse-boneyard-matches-lead-best-moments-from-surreal-2020-show/|title=WWE WrestleMania 36 results: Firefly FunHouse, Boneyard matches lead best moments from surreal 2020 show|website=CBSSports.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://africa.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/28997784/wwe-wrestlemania-36-live-results-recaps-analysis|title=WrestleMania 36: McIntyre stops Lesnar, Gronk wins 24/7 title|date=2020-04-05|website=ESPN.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event of Part 2, Brock Lesnar (accompanied by [[Paul Heyman]]) defended the WWE Championship against Drew McIntyre.

Lesnar then performed two more F-5's, both of which again resulted in nearfalls.

While most agreed that WrestleMania 36 suffered from both a poor lead-up and the absence of a live audience, many felt that the event exceeded expectations, with both critics and fans largely praising the Boneyard and Firefly Fun House matches as the best of the event for their uniqueness and over-the-top tone (and in the case of the latter, its inventiveness and humor); the SmackDown Tag Team Championship match and Owens vs. Rollins were also singled out by most critics.<ref name=\"HollywoodReporterReview\">{{Cite web |last=Szalai |first=Georg |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/how-wwe-pulled-wrestlemania-36-fans-business-impact-1288659 |title=How WWE Pulled Off WrestleMania 36 Without Fans and What It Means for Its Business and Future |publisher=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=April 6, 2020 |accessdate=April 8, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"SlateReview\">{{Cite web |last=Bixenspan |first=David |url=https://slate.com/culture/2020/04/wrestlemania-36-no-fans-audience-coronavirus-undertaker-john-cena.html |title=WrestleMania Still Happened Last Weekend.

While praising WWE for making the most out of its \"weirdest WrestleMania of all time\", particularly praising the Boneyard match, he did point out that most matches suffered from its poor lead-up and lack of live audience, stating notably that Becky Lynch and Shayna Baszler's match was \"a listless and too-short battle that, when you consider the response both performers tend to extract from crowds, might have shifted into another gear in a packed stadium.\" He also cited examples of \"shoddy storytelling\", noting that it \"[was] great that Braun Strowman beat the snot out of Goldberg, but it might have resonated more if the company hadn't just had the 53-year old Goldberg destroy The Fiend, a heretofore untouchable star, during a [[Super ShowDown (2020)| PPV in Saudi Arabia]]\u2014and, you know, done anything with Braun over the past few years.\"<ref name=\"AVCReview\">{{Cite web |last=Colbrun |first=Randall |url=https://tv.avclub.com/the-weirdest-wrestlemania-of-all-time-at-least-figured-1842699373 |title=The Weirdest Wrestlemania of All Time at Least Figured Out How to Use Its Legends |work=[[The A.

Others decided to play to a crowd that wasn't actually there. [...] the WWE style\u2014with its emphasis on overwrought capital\u2013P 'performance,' over-rehearsed matches, and flowery mannerisms\u2014looked more like a parody when staged in front of zero spectators. Still, expectations for this WrestleMania were low, albeit with some minor optimism over the show being divided up into two nights instead of the marathon one-night slogs of recent years.\" However, he stated that after two lackluster opening matches, the card from Lynch vs. Baszler onward was \"very physical matches [which] made the best of the setting, and with most of the matches fitting that bill, [Part 1] was really strong overall\", although he found Part 2 much weaker, stating that Edge vs. Randy Orton was \"glacially slow, and it appeared to somehow be edited out of an even longer match\", and that Lesnar vs. McIntyre felt \"more like a formality than anything cool, because it was so paint-by-numbers.\" ''Slate'' considered the Boneyard and Firefly Fun House matches to be the best matches.<ref name=\"SlateReview\"/>\n\n''[[Bleacher Report]]'' stated \"It's hard to judge this event. You have to take the good with the bad, maintain honest integrity with criticism, but also be forgiving and acknowledge that this was not how WrestleMania was supposed to be.\" They gave a positive review, although they ranked Elias vs. Corbin, Black vs. Lashley, and the SmackDown Women's title match as the low points of the event.<ref name=\"BleacherReview1\">{{Cite web |last=Mango |first=Anthony |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2883707-wwe-wrestlemania-36-results-reviewing-top-highlights-and-low-points-of-day-1 |title=WWE WrestleMania 36 Results: Reviewing Top Highlights and Low Points of Day 1 |publisher=[[Bleacher Report]] |date=April 5, 2020 |accessdate=April 8, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"BleacherReview2\">{{Cite web |last=Mango |first=Anthony |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2883709-wwe-wrestlemania-36-results-reviewing-top-highlights-and-low-points-of-day-2 |title=WWE WrestleMania 36 Results: Reviewing Top Highlights and Low Points of Day 2 |publisher=[[Bleacher Report]] |date=April 6, 2020 |accessdate=April 8, 2020}}</ref> Additionally, ''Bleacher Report'' gave the Boneyard match a 4.5 star ratings on a scale of 5, their highest rated match from both nights, while giving the Universal Championship match a 0.5 star, their lowest rated match from the event.<ref>{{cit web|url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2885202-wwe-wrestlemania-36-results-star-ratings-for-all-matches-from-full-show|title=WWE WrestleMania 36 Results: Star Ratings for All Matches from Full Show|author=Rill, Jake|date=April 6, 2020|accessdate=April 8, 2020|work=Bleacher Report}}</ref>\n\n''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' noted that the Boneyard and Firefly Fun House matches could set a precedent for WWE using more \"cinematic experiences\" in its programming to make up for the closed door tapings.<ref name=\"HollywoodReporterReview\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\n===Raw===\nThe following night's episode of ''Raw'' showed the \"hidden WrestleMania main event\", in which Drew McIntyre retained the WWE Championship over Big Show roughly 25 minutes after McIntyre had defeated Brock Lesnar to win the title.<ref name=\"Raw04062020\">{{cite web|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2020/04/06/4-6-wwe-raw-results-powells-live-review-of-the-night-after-wrestlemania-36-edition-featuring-new-wwe-champion-drew-mcintyre-whats-next-for-edge-seth-rollins-becky-lynch-and-shayna-baszler/|title=4/6 WWE Raw Results: Powell\u2019s live review of the night after WrestleMania 36 edition featuring new WWE Champion Drew McIntyre, what\u2019s next for Edge, Seth Rollins, Becky Lynch, and Shayna Baszler|date=April 6, 2020|last=Powell|first=Jason|work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net|accessdate=April 18, 2020}}</ref>\n\nRaw Women's Champion Becky Lynch praised Shayna Baszler in their WrestleMania match and stated that Baszler knew where to find her if she wanted to face off again.<ref name=\"Raw04062020\"/> The following week, Baszler won her qualifying match to compete in the women's [[Money in the Bank ladder match]].<ref name=\"Raw04132020\">{{cite web|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2020/04/13/4-13-wwe-raw-results-powells-live-review-of-drew-mcintyre-and-becky-lynch-appearances-money-in-the-bank-qualifying-matches-featuring-asuka-vs-ruby-riott-kairi-sane-vs-nia-jax-and-sarah-logan-v/|title=4/13 WWE Raw Results: Powell\u2019s live review of Drew McIntyre and Becky Lynch appearances, Money in the Bank qualifying matches featuring Asuka vs. Ruby Riott, Kairi Sane vs. Nia Jax, and Sarah Logan vs. Shayna Baszler|date=April 13, 2020|last=Powell|first=Jason|work=Pro Wresting Dot Net|accessdate=April 18, 2020}}</ref>\n\nRaw Tag Team Champions The Street Profits (Angelo Dawkins and Montez Ford) had a rematch with Austin Theory and Angel Garza (with Zelina Vega) where they again retained, though by disqualification thanks to Vega.

The song received positive reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]], and peaked at number 34 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Outside the United States, \"Like Toy Soldiers\" topped the charts in the United Kingdom and peaked within the top 10 of the charts in 12 countries, including Australia and New Zealand. The song samples \"[[Toy Soldiers (song)|Toy Soldiers]]\" by [[Martika]] and the opening music to the film \"[[The Hot Rock (film)|The Hot Rock]]\" by [[Quincy Jones]]\n\n==Content==\n\"Like Toy Soldiers\" tells the story of Eminem's attempts to calm a violent community of rappers. Eminem speaks openly about problems with ''[[The Source (magazine)|The Source]]'' magazine and its editor [[Benzino]], as well as the situation between [[50 Cent]] and [[Ja Rule]] and his label [[Murder Inc. Records|Murder Inc.]], which Eminem felt went far beyond the [[Jay Z]] vs. [[Nas]] feud.<ref name=\"songfacts.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=5606 |title=Like Toy Soldiers by Eminem Songfacts |publisher=Songfacts.com |date= |accessdate=April 2, 2014}}</ref> The song finishes as Eminem offers a truce to his enemies. In addition, this song also reveals that Eminem had tried to stop Ja Rule & 50 Cent's feud, but lost it when he heard Ja Rule making fun of his daughter on a track called \"Loose Change\" \u2013 (\"The Ja Shit, I tried to squash it, It was too late to stop it, There's a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it, I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it\"). In the song \"Loose Change\", Ja Rule says Eminem claims his ex-wife is \"a known slut\" and his mother \"a crackhead\", and then asks him \"so what's Hailie gonna be when she grows up?\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Reid |first=Shaheem |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1471038/ja-rule-calls-50-loose-change.jhtml |title=Ja Rule Calls 50 'Loose Change,' Disses 'Feminem' And Dr. Dre |publisher=MTV.com |date=April 4, 2003 |accessdate=April 2, 2014}}</ref> \"Like Toy Soldiers\" was later included on Eminem's [[compilation album]] ''[[Curtain Call: The Hits]]'' in 2005. Throughout his career, Eminem, at most, only alludes to [[Suge Knight]], completing a line in this song, \"my intentions were good, I went through my whole career without ever mentioning -.\" Styles P used the instrumental version in his song \"Soldiers Song\", in 2006.<ref name=\"songfacts.com\"/>\n\nAs a result of this song, Eminem refused to get himself involved in some of 50 Cent's later feuds, including [[Jadakiss]], [[Fat Joe]] (both of whom he collaborated with in 2005), and [[The Game (rapper)|The Game]].\n\n== Critical reception ==\n[[AllMusic]] highlighted the song.<ref>{{cite web|author=[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/encore-mw0001996708 |title=Encore - Eminem &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |website=AllMusic |date=November 12, 2004 |accessdate=April 2, 2014}}</ref> A positive overview came from J-23: \"\"Like Toy Soldiers\" is among his best work here, from his production (complete with Martika sample), to his gripping recount, assessment and conclusion of the Benzino and Murder Inc beefs.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|author=J-23 |url=http://hiphopdx.com/reviews/id.486/title.eminem-encore# |title=Eminem - Encore |magazine=[[HipHopDX]] |date=November 15, 2004 |accessdate=May 5, 2017}}</ref> [[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]] was also positive, calling it:\n<blockquote>a public hand-wringing over the feuds that Em and 50 Cent have been drawn into, the consequences of these battles, and-- most importantly-- the toll they've taken, both physically and emotionally. The martial beat is a bit heavy-handed, but it's counterbalanced by the pleasantly surprising chorus' sample of Martika's \"Toy Soldiers\", perhaps a nod to either Kanye's helium-vocaled samples or the 00s trend toward trance-pop covers of 80s hits.<ref>{{cite web|author=Scott Plagenhoef |url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2772-encore/ |title=Eminem: Encore &#124; Album Reviews |publisher=[[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]] |date=2004-11-11 |accessdate=2014-04-02}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n''[[NME]]'' wrote a favorable review:\n<blockquote>'Like Toy Soldiers\u2019 is a case in point. The best track of this album, and probably any album this year, it should be appalling. It interpolates (by which we mean \u2018steals\u2019) the chorus to a long-forgotten \u201980s power ballad by Martika, which would be a surefire route to disaster in anyone else\u2019s hands. Instead, with its martial drumbeat, unashamedly vast-scale soft rock dynamics and that similarly monolithic chorus, it is perhaps hip-hop\u2019s first genuine lighters-in-the-air stadium anthem. And yet it\u2019s probably the most personal track on the album...as Em tries to draw a line under the various beefs he and his cohorts have been embroiled in. \u201cEven though the battle was won/I feel like we lost it/I spent [so much energy] on it/Honestly I\u2019m exhausted\u201d, he admits.

It begins at the hospital where Eminem and other rappers are watching, in despair, the doctors trying to save [[D12]] member [[Bugz]] (played by fellow D12 member [[Proof (rapper)|Proof]]), who was killed in 1999. Eminem is then seen in a series of scenes rapping the song in a deserted alleyway, before the video goes through a series of scenes showing the various feuds mentioned in the song. They include seeing the news, rappers battling in studios, and street encounters. Near the end, Eminem stands shocked seeing the shooting of Bugz. It switches back to the hospital, where Bugz dies, and finishes at his funeral, which has a choir in which the black child and the white child from when Martika starts to sing.\n\nCameo appearances in the video include [[50 Cent]], [[Luis Resto (musician)|Luis Resto]], [[Dr. Dre]], [[Obie Trice]], and D12. Dead rappers including [[Tupac Shakur]], [[The Notorious B.I.G.]], [[Big L]], and [[Bugz]] are also shown in animation form at the end of the music video to show the fatal consequences of rap wars.\n\nIn a case of life imitating art, Proof himself was shot and killed on April 11, 2006, after an altercation broke out at a nightclub in Detroit, Michigan.  \"In the year after [Proof] died,\" Eminem said in an interview.  \"I would stare at the ceiling and think about that video (Like Toy Soldiers).

The song received positive reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]], and peaked at number 34 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Outside the United States, \"Like Toy Soldiers\" topped the charts in the United Kingdom and peaked within the top 10 of the charts in 12 countries, including Australia and New Zealand. The song samples \"[[Toy Soldiers (song)|Toy Soldiers]]\" by [[Martika]] and the opening music to the film \"[[The Hot Rock (film)|The Hot Rock]]\" by [[Quincy Jones]]\n\n==Content==\n\"Like Toy Soldiers\" tells the story of Eminem's attempts to calm a violent community of rappers. Eminem speaks openly about problems with ''[[The Source (magazine)|The Source]]'' magazine and its editor [[Benzino]], as well as the situation between [[50 Cent]] and [[Ja Rule]] and his label [[Murder Inc. Records|Murder Inc.]], which Eminem felt went far beyond the [[Jay Z]] vs. [[Nas]] feud.<ref name=\"songfacts.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=5606 |title=Like Toy Soldiers by Eminem Songfacts |publisher=Songfacts.com |date= |accessdate=April 2, 2014}}</ref> The song finishes as Eminem offers a truce to his enemies. In addition, this song also reveals that Eminem had tried to stop Ja Rule & 50 Cent's feud, but lost it when he heard Ja Rule making fun of his daughter on a track called \"Loose Change\" \u2013 (\"The Ja Shit, I tried to squash it, It was too late to stop it, There's a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it, I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it\"). In the song \"Loose Change\", Ja Rule says Eminem claims his ex-wife is \"a known slut\" and his mother \"a crackhead\", and then asks him \"so what's Hailie gonna be when she grows up?\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Reid |first=Shaheem |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1471038/ja-rule-calls-50-loose-change.jhtml |title=Ja Rule Calls 50 'Loose Change,' Disses 'Feminem' And Dr. Dre |publisher=MTV.com |date=April 4, 2003 |accessdate=April 2, 2014}}</ref> \"Like Toy Soldiers\" was later included on Eminem's [[compilation album]] ''[[Curtain Call: The Hits]]'' in 2005. Throughout his career, Eminem, at most, only alludes to [[Suge Knight]], completing a line in this song, \"my intentions were good, I went through my whole career without ever mentioning -.\" Styles P used the instrumental version in his song \"Soldiers Song\", in 2006.<ref name=\"songfacts.com\"/>\n\nAs a result of this song, Eminem refused to get himself involved in some of 50 Cent's later feuds, including [[Jadakiss]], [[Fat Joe]] (both of whom he collaborated with in 2005), and [[The Game (rapper)|The Game]].\n\n== Critical reception ==\n[[AllMusic]] highlighted the song.<ref>{{cite web|author=[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/encore-mw0001996708 |title=Encore - Eminem &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |website=AllMusic |date=November 12, 2004 |accessdate=April 2, 2014}}</ref> A positive overview came from J-23: \"\"Like Toy Soldiers\" is among his best work here, from his production (complete with Martika sample), to his gripping recount, assessment and conclusion of the Benzino and Murder Inc beefs.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|author=J-23 |url=http://hiphopdx.com/reviews/id.486/title.eminem-encore# |title=Eminem - Encore |magazine=[[HipHopDX]] |date=November 15, 2004 |accessdate=May 5, 2017}}</ref> [[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]] was also positive, calling it:\n<blockquote>a public hand-wringing over the feuds that Em and 50 Cent have been drawn into, the consequences of these battles, and-- most importantly-- the toll they've taken, both physically and emotionally. The martial beat is a bit heavy-handed, but it's counterbalanced by the pleasantly surprising chorus' sample of Martika's \"Toy Soldiers\", perhaps a nod to either Kanye's helium-vocaled samples or the 00s trend toward trance-pop covers of 80s hits.<ref>{{cite web|author=Scott Plagenhoef |url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2772-encore/ |title=Eminem: Encore &#124; Album Reviews |publisher=[[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]] |date=2004-11-11 |accessdate=2014-04-02}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n''[[NME]]'' wrote a favorable review:\n<blockquote>'Like Toy Soldiers\u2019 is a case in point. The best track of this album, and probably any album this year, it should be appalling. It interpolates (by which we mean \u2018steals\u2019) the chorus to a long-forgotten \u201980s power ballad by Martika, which would be a surefire route to disaster in anyone else\u2019s hands. Instead, with its martial drumbeat, unashamedly vast-scale soft rock dynamics and that similarly monolithic chorus, it is perhaps hip-hop\u2019s first genuine lighters-in-the-air stadium anthem. And yet it\u2019s probably the most personal track on the album...as Em tries to draw a line under the various beefs he and his cohorts have been embroiled in. \u201cEven though the battle was won/I feel like we lost it/I spent [so much energy] on it/Honestly I\u2019m exhausted\u201d, he admits.

It begins at the hospital where Eminem and other rappers are watching, in despair, the doctors trying to save [[D12]] member [[Bugz]] (played by fellow D12 member [[Proof (rapper)|Proof]]), who was killed in 1999. Eminem is then seen in a series of scenes rapping the song in a deserted alleyway, before the video goes through a series of scenes showing the various feuds mentioned in the song. They include seeing the news, rappers battling in studios, and street encounters. Near the end, Eminem stands shocked seeing the shooting of Bugz. It switches back to the hospital, where Bugz dies, and finishes at his funeral, which has a choir in which the black child and the white child from when Martika starts to sing.\n\nCameo appearances in the video include [[50 Cent]], [[Luis Resto (musician)|Luis Resto]], [[Dr. Dre]], [[Obie Trice]], and D12. Dead rappers including [[Tupac Shakur]], [[The Notorious B.I.G.]], [[Big L]], and [[Bugz]] are also shown in animation form at the end of the music video to show the fatal consequences of rap wars.\n\nIn a case of life imitating art, Proof himself was shot and killed on April 11, 2006, after an altercation broke out at a nightclub in Detroit, Michigan.  \"In the year after [Proof] died,\" Eminem said in an interview.  \"I would stare at the ceiling and think about that video (Like Toy Soldiers).

The term was developed by [[Merrill Singer]] in the mid-1990s.

Two or more diseases can be comorbid without interactions, or interaction occurs but it is beneficial, not deleterious.

During a randomized, double-blind clinical trial testing the efficacy of the prototype HIV vaccine called V520 there appeared to be an increased risk for HIV infection among the vaccinated participants. Notably, participants immune to the common cold virus [[adenovirus]] type 5 had a higher risk of HIV infection. The vaccine was created using a replication-defective version of Ad5 as a carrier, or delivery vector, for three synthetically produced HIV genes. On November 6, 2007, Merck & Co. announced that research had been stopped suspecting the higher rate of HIV infection among individuals in the vaccinated was because the vaccine lowered defenses against HIV.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n==Examples==\nVarious syndemics though not always labeled as such have been described in the literature, including the \n*SAVA syndemic (substance abuse, violence and AIDS,<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Substance Abuse, Violence, and HIV in Women: A Literature Review of the Syndemic |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51214609 |journal=Journal of Women's Health  |date=June 2011 |volume=20\u00b7|issue=7 |pages=991\u20131006  |doi=10.1089/jwh.2010.2328|pmid=21668380 |pmc=3130513|last1=Meyer |first1=J.

The drop in HIV virus levels may be due to a lack of target CD4+ T cells in which they replicate, or measles virus may stimulate the production of proteins suppressing HIV replication, including the \u03b2-chemokines, [[CD8+ cell noncytotoxic anti-HIV response]], and the cytokines [[Interleukin 10|IL-10]] and IL-16. median plasma levels of [[RANTES]], a chemokine that attracts immune system components like eosinophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes were higher in HIV-infected children with measles than in those without measles(Moss and co-workers).{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n*HIV suppression in [[tsutsugamuchi disease]] or scrub typhus, a mite-borne infection in Asia and Australia, but how this occurs is unclear.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\n===19th century Native American ===\nContact between Native Americans and Europeans during the [[Columbian Exchange]] led to lethal syndemics within the Native American population due to diseases introduced which the Native Americans had not encountered before and had not built-up immunity to.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nAn example of a syndemic from the 19th century can be found on the reservations on which Native Americans were confined with the closing of the U.S. frontier. It is estimated that in 1860 there were well over 10 million [[bison]] living on the American [[Great Plains|Plains]]. By the early 1880s, the last of the great herds of bison upon which [[Plains Indian]] peoples like the [[Sioux]] were dependent as a food source were gone.  At the same time, after the U.S. military's defeat at the [[Battle of the Little Bighorn]] in 1876, there was a concerted effort to beat the Sioux into total submission. Thus, in 1872, Secretary of the Interior [[Columbus Delano]] stated: \"as they become convinced that they can no longer rely upon the supply of game for their support, they will return to the more reliable source of subsistence [i.e., farming].\" As a result, they were forced to give up their struggle for an independent existence on their own lands and take up reservation life at the mercy of government authority.  Treaties that were signed with the Sioux in 1868 and 1876 stipulated that they would be provided with government annuities and provisions in payment for sections of their land and with the expectation among federal representatives that the Sioux would become farmers on individually held plots of land. The Sioux found themselves confined on a series of small reservations where they were treated as a conquered people. Moreover, the government reneged on its promises, food was insufficient and of low quality. [[Black Elk]], a noted Sioux folk healer, told his biographer: \"There was hunger among my people before I went across the big water [to Europe in 1886], because the Wasichus [whites] did not give us all the food they promised in the Black Hills treaty...  But it was worse when I came back [1889]. My people looked pitiful\u2026  We could not eat lies and there was nothing we could do.\"  Under extremely stressful conditions, with inadequate diets, and as victims of overt racism on the part of the registration agents appointed to oversee Indian reserves, the Sioux confronted infectious disease from contact with whites. knowledge about the epidemiology of the Sioux from this period is limited, [[James Mooney]], an anthropologist and representative of the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] sent to investigate a possible Sioux rebellion, described the health situation on the reservation in 1896: \"In 1888 their cattle had been diminished by disease.  In 1889, their crops were a failure ...  Thus followed epidemics of measles, grippe [influenza], and whooping cough [[Pertussis]], in rapid succession and with terrible fatal results\u2026\"  Similarly, the ''Handbook of American Indians'' notes, \"The least hopeful conditions in this respect prevail among the Dakota [Sioux] and other tribes of the colder northern regions, where pulmonary tuberculosis and scrofula are very common\u2026  Other more common diseases, are various forms of, bronchitis ...pneumonia, [[pleurisy]], and measles in the young. Whooping cough is also met with.\"  Indian children were removed to white boarding schools and diagnosed with a wide range of diseases, including tuberculosis, trachoma, measles, smallpox, whooping cough, influenza, and pneumonia.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe Sioux were victims of a syndemic of interacting infectious diseases including the [[1889\u20131890 flu pandemic]], inadequate diet, and stressful and extremely disheartening life conditions, including outright brutalization with events like the massacre at [[Wounded Knee Massacre|Wounded Knee]] in 1890 and the murder of their leader [[Sitting Bull]]. While the official mortality rate on the reservation was between one and two percent, the death rate was probably closer to 10 percent.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n===Influenza===\nThere were three influenza [[pandemics]] during the 20th century that caused widespread illness, mortality, social disruption, and significant economic losses.  These occurred in 1918, 1957, and 1968. In each case, mortality rates were determined primarily by five factors: the number of people who became infected, the virulence of the virus causing the pandemic, the speed of global spread, the underlying features and vulnerabilities of the most affected populations, and the effectiveness and timeliness of the prevention and treatment measures that were implemented.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe [[1957 pandemic]] was caused by the Asian influenza virus (known as the H2N2 strain), a novel influenza variety to which humans had not yet developed immunities. The death toll of the 1957 pandemic is estimated to have been around two million globally, with approximately 70,000 deaths in the United States.  A little over a decade later, the comparatively mild Hong Kong influenza pandemic erupted due to the spread of a virus strain (H3N2) that genetically was related to the more deadly form seen in 1957.  The pandemic was responsible for about one million deaths around the world, almost 34,000 of which were in the United States.  In both of these pandemics, death may not have been due only to the primary viral infection, but also to secondary bacterial infections among influenza patients; in short, they were caused by a viral/bacterial syndemic (but see Chatterjee 2007).\n\nThe worst of the 20th-century influenza pandemics was the [[1918 pandemic]], where between 20-40 percent of the world's population became ill between 40-100 million people died.  More people died of the so-called [[Spanish flu]] (caused by the [[H1N1]] viral strain) pandemic in the single year of 1918 than during all four-years of the [[Black Death]]. The pandemic had devastating effects as disease spread along trade and shipping routes and other corridors of human movement until it had circled the globe. In India, the mortality rate reached 50 per 1,000 population. Arriving during the closing phase of World War I, the pandemic impacted mobilized national armies. Half of U.S. soldiers who died in the \"Great War,\" for example, were victims of influenza. It is estimated that almost \u00be of a million Americans died during the pandemic. In part, the death toll during the pandemic was caused by viral pneumonia characterized by extensive bleeding in the lungs resulting in suffocation.  Many victims died within 48 hours of the appearance of the first symptom.  It was not uncommon for people who appeared to be quite healthy in the morning to have died by sunset. Among those who survived the first several days, however, many died of secondary bacterial pneumonia. It has been argued that countless numbers of those who expired quickly from the disease were co-infected with tuberculosis, which would explain the notable plummet in TB cases after 1918.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n===Climate change===\nAs a result of the floral changes produced by global warming, an escalation is occurring in global rates of allergies and [[asthma]]. Allergic diseases constitute the sixth leading cause of chronic illness in the United States, impacting  17 percent of the population.  Asthma affects about 8 percent of the U.S. population, with rising tendency, especially in low income, ethnic minority neighborhoods in cities. In 1980 asthma affected only about three percent of the U.S. population according to the U.S. CDC.  Asthma among children has been increasing at an even faster pace than among adults, with the percentage of children with asthma going up from 3.6 percent in 1980 to 9 percent in 2005. Among ethnic minority populations, like Puerto Ricans the rate of asthma is 125 percent higher than non-Hispanic white people and 80 percent higher than non-Hispanic black people. The asthma prevalence among American Indians, Alaska Natives and black people is 25 percent higher than in white people.\n\n===Air pollution===\nIncreases in asthma rates have occurred despite improvements in air quality produced by the passage and enforcement of clean air legislation, such as the U.S. Clean Air Act of 1963 and the Clean Air Act of 1990. existing legislation and regulation have not kept pace with changing climatic conditions and their health consequences.  Compounding the problem of air quality is the fact that air-borne pollens have been found to attach themselves to diesel particles from truck or other vehicular exhaust floating in the air, resulting in heightened rates of asthma in areas where busy roads bisect densely populated areas, most notably in poorer inner-city areas.\n\nFor every elevation of 10 \u03bcg/m3 in [[particulate matter]] concentration in the air a six percent increase in cardiopulmonary deaths occurs according to research by the American Cancer Society. Exhaust from the burning of diesel fuel is a complex mixture of vapors, gases, and fine particles, including over 40 known pollutants like nitrogen oxide and known or suspected carcinogenic substances such as benzene, arsenic, and formaldehyde. Exposure to [[diesel exhaust]] irritates the eyes, nose, throat and lungs, causing coughs, headaches, light-headedness and nausea, while causing people with allergies to be more susceptible allergy triggers like dust or pollen. Many particles in disease fuel are so tiny they are able to penetrate deep into the lungs when inhaled.  Importantly, diesel fuel particles appear to have even greater immunologic effects in the presence of environmental allergens than they do alone.  \"This immunologic evidence may help explain the epidemiologic studies indicating that children living along major trucking thoroughfares are at increased risk for asthmatic and allergic symptoms and are more likely to have respiratory dysfunction.\" according to Robert Pandya and co-workers.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe damaging effects of diesel fuel pollution go beyond a synergistic role in asthma development. Exposure to a combination of microscopic diesel fuel particles among people with high blood cholesterol (i.e., [[low-density lipoprotein]], LDL or \"bad cholesterol\") increases the risk for both heart attack and stroke above levels found among those exposed to only one of these health risks.  According to [[Andr\u00e9 Nel]], Chief of Nanomedicine at the [[David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA]], \"When you add one plus one, it normally totals two... But we found that adding diesel particles to cholesterol fats equals three. Their combination creates a dangerous synergy that wreaks cardiovascular havoc far beyond what's caused by the diesel or cholesterol alone.\"  Experimentation revealed that the two mechanisms worked in tandem to stimulate genes that promote cell inflammation, a primary risk for hardening and blockage of blood vessels ([[atherosclerosis]]) and, as narrowed arteries collect cholesterol deposits and trigger blood clots, for [[heart attacks]] and [[strokes]] as well.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n==Mathematical modelling==\nA [[mathematical model]] is a simplified representation using mathematical language to describe natural, mechanical or social system dynamics. Epidemiological modelers unite several types of information and analytic capacity, including: 1) mathematical equations and computational algorithms; 2) computer technology; 3) epidemiological knowledge about [[infectious disease dynamics]], including information about specific pathogens and disease [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]]; and 4) research data on social conditions and human behavior.  [[Mathematical modelling in epidemiology]] is now being applied to syndemics.\n\nFor example, modelling to quantify the syndemic effects of malaria and HIV in sub-Saharan Africa based on research in Kisumu, Kenya researchers found that 5% of HIV infections (or 8,500 cases of HIV since 1980) in Kisumu are the result of the higher HIV infectiousness of malaria-infected HIV patients.  Additionally, their model attributed 10% of adult malaria episodes (or almost one million excess malaria infections since 1980) to the greater susceptibility of HIV infected individuals to malaria.  Their model also suggests that HIV has contributed to the wider geographic spread of malaria in Africa, a process previously thought to be the consequence primarily of global warming.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Abu-Raddad Laith |author2=Patnaik P. |author3=Kublin J | year = 2006 | title = Dual Infection with HIV and Malaria Fuels the Spread of Both Diseases in sub-Saharan Africa | url = | journal = Science | volume = 314 | issue = 5805| pages = 1603\u20131606 | doi=10.1126/science.1132338 | pmid=17158329|bibcode=2006Sci...314.1603A }}</ref>  Modelling offers an enormously useful tool for anticipating future syndemics, including eco-syndemic, based on information about the spread of various diseases across the planet and the consequent co-infections and disease interactions that will result.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Herring D.

Unlike other life-table population models, PopMod is designed to not assume the statistical independence of the diseases of interest.  The PopMod has several intended purposes, including describing the time evolution of population health for standard demographic purposes (such as estimating healthy life expectancy in a population), and providing a standard measure of effectiveness for health interventions and cost-effectiveness analysis.  PopMod is used as one of the standard tools of the World Health Organization's ([[WHO]]) CHOICE (Choosing Interventions that are Cost-Effective) program, an initiative designed to provide national health policymakers in the WHO's 14 epidemiological sub-regions around the world with findings on a range of health intervention costs and effects.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Lauer Jeremy |author2=R\u00f6hrich Klaus |author3=Wirth Harald |author4=Charette Claude |author5=Gribble Steve |author6=Murray Christopher | year = 2003 | title = PopMod: a longitudinal population model with two interacting disease states | journal = Cost Effectiveness and Resource Allocation | volume = 1 | issue = 1| page = 6 | pmc=156025 | pmid=12773215|doi=10.1186/1478-7547-1-6 }}</ref>\n\nAlthough in Merrill Singer's conceptual work on syndemics the study of disease interaction is a central issue, most empirically based research studies have not used appropriate statistical models to do so.

There is a need to identify all of the ways, directly and indirectly, that diseases can interact and have, as a result, enhanced impact on human health. Third there is a need for the development of an '''eco-syndemic''' understanding of the ways in which [[global warming]] contributes to the spread of diseases and new disease interactions. \nThere is a need for a better understanding of how public health systems and communities can best respond to and limit the health consequences of syndemics. Systems are needed to monitor the emergence of syndemics and to allow early medical and public health responses to lessen their impact. Systematic ethno-epidemiological surveillance with populations subject to multiple social stressors must be one component of such a monitoring system.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Endemic (epidemiology)|Endemic]]\n* [[List of epidemics]]\n* [[List of human diseases associated with infectious pathogens]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading==\n\n===Books===\n* Marshall, Mac 2013 ''Drinking Smoke: The Tobacco Syndemic in Oceania.''

The term was developed by [[Merrill Singer]] in the mid-1990s. Syndemics develop under [[health disparity]], caused by [[poverty]], stress, or [[structural violence]] and are studied by [[Epidemiology|epidemiologists]] and [[Medical anthropology|medical anthropologists]] concerned with public health, [[community health]] and the effects of social conditions on health.\n\nThe syndemic approach departs from the biomedical approach to diseases to diagnostically isolate, study, and treat diseases as distinct entities separate from other diseases and [[Independence (probability theory)|independent]] of social contexts.\n\n==Definition==\nA syndemic is a [[synergistic]] epidemic.

The difference between \"comorbid\" and \"syndemic\" is per Mustanski et al. (2008:40){{full citation needed|date=March 2017}} \"comorbidity research tends to focus on the [[Nosology|nosological]] issues of boundaries and overlap of diagnoses, while syndemic research focuses on communities experiencing co-occurring epidemics that additively increase negative health consequences.\" It is possible for two afflictions to be comorbid, but not syndemic i.e., the disorders are not [[epidemic]] in the studied population, or their co-occurrence is not accompanied by worsened health. Two or more diseases can be comorbid without interactions, or interaction occurs but it is beneficial, not deleterious. ''Syndemic theory'' seeks to draw attention to and provide a framework for the analysis of adverse disease interactions, including their causes and consequences for human life and well-being.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n==Types of disease interaction==\nDiseases regularly interact and this interaction influences disease course, expression, severity, transmission, and diffusion. Interaction among diseases may be both indirect (changes caused by one disease that facilitate another through an intermediary) and direct (diseases act in direct tandem).\n\n* One disease can assist the [[Transmission (medicine)|physical transmission]] of the microbe causing another disease, for example, genital-tract ulceration caused by syphilis allowing sexual transmission of HIV.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n* One disease may enhance the [[virulence]] of another, as for example, [[herpes simplex virus]] co-infection exacerbates HIV infection with progression to AIDS,{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}  periodontal bacteria may enhance the virulence of herpesvirus,{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} HIV-infected individuals are more susceptible to [[tuberculosis]]; As of 2011, the cause was not fully understood.<ref>Diedrich, CR.

In coinfected cells, the retroviral DNA of the avian leukosis virus can integrate into the MDV genome, producing altered biological properties compared to those of the parental MDV. The frequency of gene reassortment among human pathogens is less clear than it is the among plant or animal species but of concern as animal diseases adapt to human hosts and as man new diseases comes into contact.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n* When one disease diminishes or eradicates another it is a counter-syndemic disease interaction.\n* The linkage also may not be clear, despite obvious syndemic interactions among diseases, as for example in [[type 2 diabetes]] mellitus and [[hepatitis C virus]] infection.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n==Iatrogenic==\nThe term [[iatrogenesis]] means \"brought forth by a healer\" and refers to [[adverse effect]]s on health caused by medical treatment. This is possible if medical treatment or medical research creates conditions that increase the likelihood that two or more diseases come together in a population. For example, if [[gene splicing]]  unites two pathogenic agents and the resulting novel organism infects a population. One study suggests the possibility of iatriogenic syndemics. During a randomized, double-blind clinical trial testing the efficacy of the prototype HIV vaccine called V520 there appeared to be an increased risk for HIV infection among the vaccinated participants. Notably, participants immune to the common cold virus [[adenovirus]] type 5 had a higher risk of HIV infection. The vaccine was created using a replication-defective version of Ad5 as a carrier, or delivery vector, for three synthetically produced HIV genes.

Several potential mechanisms could be responsible. Measles virus infection causes [[lymphopenia]], a reduction in the number of [[CD4+ T lymphocytes]] circulating in the blood. The low point occurs just prior to the onset of the characteristic skin rash. Within a month of this nadir, the number of lymphocytes return to normal levels. The drop in HIV virus levels may be due to a lack of target CD4+ T cells in which they replicate, or measles virus may stimulate the production of proteins suppressing HIV replication, including the \u03b2-chemokines, [[CD8+ cell noncytotoxic anti-HIV response]], and the cytokines [[Interleukin 10|IL-10]] and IL-16. median plasma levels of [[RANTES]], a chemokine that attracts immune system components like eosinophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes were higher in HIV-infected children with measles than in those without measles(Moss and co-workers).{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n*HIV suppression in [[tsutsugamuchi disease]] or scrub typhus, a mite-borne infection in Asia and Australia, but how this occurs is unclear.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\n===19th century Native American ===\nContact between Native Americans and Europeans during the [[Columbian Exchange]] led to lethal syndemics within the Native American population due to diseases introduced which the Native Americans had not encountered before and had not built-up immunity to.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nAn example of a syndemic from the 19th century can be found on the reservations on which Native Americans were confined with the closing of the U.S. frontier. It is estimated that in 1860 there were well over 10 million [[bison]] living on the American [[Great Plains|Plains]]. By the early 1880s, the last of the great herds of bison upon which [[Plains Indian]] peoples like the [[Sioux]] were dependent as a food source were gone.  At the same time, after the U.S. military's defeat at the [[Battle of the Little Bighorn]] in 1876, there was a concerted effort to beat the Sioux into total submission. Thus, in 1872, Secretary of the Interior [[Columbus Delano]] stated: \"as they become convinced that they can no longer rely upon the supply of game for their support, they will return to the more reliable source of subsistence [i.e., farming].\" As a result, they were forced to give up their struggle for an independent existence on their own lands and take up reservation life at the mercy of government authority.  Treaties that were signed with the Sioux in 1868 and 1876 stipulated that they would be provided with government annuities and provisions in payment for sections of their land and with the expectation among federal representatives that the Sioux would become farmers on individually held plots of land. The Sioux found themselves confined on a series of small reservations where they were treated as a conquered people. Moreover, the government reneged on its promises, food was insufficient and of low quality. [[Black Elk]], a noted Sioux folk healer, told his biographer: \"There was hunger among my people before I went across the big water [to Europe in 1886], because the Wasichus [whites] did not give us all the food they promised in the Black Hills treaty...  But it was worse when I came back [1889]. My people looked pitiful\u2026  We could not eat lies and there was nothing we could do.\"  Under extremely stressful conditions, with inadequate diets, and as victims of overt racism on the part of the registration agents appointed to oversee Indian reserves, the Sioux confronted infectious disease from contact with whites. knowledge about the epidemiology of the Sioux from this period is limited, [[James Mooney]], an anthropologist and representative of the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] sent to investigate a possible Sioux rebellion, described the health situation on the reservation in 1896: \"In 1888 their cattle had been diminished by disease.  In 1889, their crops were a failure ...  Thus followed epidemics of measles, grippe [influenza], and whooping cough [[Pertussis]], in rapid succession and with terrible fatal results\u2026\"  Similarly, the ''Handbook of American Indians'' notes, \"The least hopeful conditions in this respect prevail among the Dakota [Sioux] and other tribes of the colder northern regions, where pulmonary tuberculosis and scrofula are very common\u2026  Other more common diseases, are various forms of, bronchitis ...pneumonia, [[pleurisy]], and measles in the young. Whooping cough is also met with.\"  Indian children were removed to white boarding schools and diagnosed with a wide range of diseases, including tuberculosis, trachoma, measles, smallpox, whooping cough, influenza, and pneumonia.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe Sioux were victims of a syndemic of interacting infectious diseases including the [[1889\u20131890 flu pandemic]], inadequate diet, and stressful and extremely disheartening life conditions, including outright brutalization with events like the massacre at [[Wounded Knee Massacre|Wounded Knee]] in 1890 and the murder of their leader [[Sitting Bull]]. While the official mortality rate on the reservation was between one and two percent, the death rate was probably closer to 10 percent.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n===Influenza===\nThere were three influenza [[pandemics]] during the 20th century that caused widespread illness, mortality, social disruption, and significant economic losses.  These occurred in 1918, 1957, and 1968. In each case, mortality rates were determined primarily by five factors: the number of people who became infected, the virulence of the virus causing the pandemic, the speed of global spread, the underlying features and vulnerabilities of the most affected populations, and the effectiveness and timeliness of the prevention and treatment measures that were implemented.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe [[1957 pandemic]] was caused by the Asian influenza virus (known as the H2N2 strain), a novel influenza variety to which humans had not yet developed immunities. The death toll of the 1957 pandemic is estimated to have been around two million globally, with approximately 70,000 deaths in the United States.  A little over a decade later, the comparatively mild Hong Kong influenza pandemic erupted due to the spread of a virus strain (H3N2) that genetically was related to the more deadly form seen in 1957.  The pandemic was responsible for about one million deaths around the world, almost 34,000 of which were in the United States.  In both of these pandemics, death may not have been due only to the primary viral infection, but also to secondary bacterial infections among influenza patients; in short, they were caused by a viral/bacterial syndemic (but see Chatterjee 2007).\n\nThe worst of the 20th-century influenza pandemics was the [[1918 pandemic]], where between 20-40 percent of the world's population became ill between 40-100 million people died.  More people died of the so-called [[Spanish flu]] (caused by the [[H1N1]] viral strain) pandemic in the single year of 1918 than during all four-years of the [[Black Death]]. The pandemic had devastating effects as disease spread along trade and shipping routes and other corridors of human movement until it had circled the globe. In India, the mortality rate reached 50 per 1,000 population. Arriving during the closing phase of World War I, the pandemic impacted mobilized national armies. Half of U.S. soldiers who died in the \"Great War,\" for example, were victims of influenza. It is estimated that almost \u00be of a million Americans died during the pandemic. In part, the death toll during the pandemic was caused by viral pneumonia characterized by extensive bleeding in the lungs resulting in suffocation.  Many victims died within 48 hours of the appearance of the first symptom.  It was not uncommon for people who appeared to be quite healthy in the morning to have died by sunset. Among those who survived the first several days, however, many died of secondary bacterial pneumonia. It has been argued that countless numbers of those who expired quickly from the disease were co-infected with tuberculosis, which would explain the notable plummet in TB cases after 1918.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n===Climate change===\nAs a result of the floral changes produced by global warming, an escalation is occurring in global rates of allergies and [[asthma]]. Allergic diseases constitute the sixth leading cause of chronic illness in the United States, impacting  17 percent of the population.  Asthma affects about 8 percent of the U.S. population, with rising tendency, especially in low income, ethnic minority neighborhoods in cities. In 1980 asthma affected only about three percent of the U.S. population according to the U.S. CDC.  Asthma among children has been increasing at an even faster pace than among adults, with the percentage of children with asthma going up from 3.6 percent in 1980 to 9 percent in 2005. Among ethnic minority populations, like Puerto Ricans the rate of asthma is 125 percent higher than non-Hispanic white people and 80 percent higher than non-Hispanic black people. The asthma prevalence among American Indians, Alaska Natives and black people is 25 percent higher than in white people.\n\n===Air pollution===\nIncreases in asthma rates have occurred despite improvements in air quality produced by the passage and enforcement of clean air legislation, such as the U.S. Clean Air Act of 1963 and the Clean Air Act of 1990. existing legislation and regulation have not kept pace with changing climatic conditions and their health consequences.  Compounding the problem of air quality is the fact that air-borne pollens have been found to attach themselves to diesel particles from truck or other vehicular exhaust floating in the air, resulting in heightened rates of asthma in areas where busy roads bisect densely populated areas, most notably in poorer inner-city areas.\n\nFor every elevation of 10 \u03bcg/m3 in [[particulate matter]] concentration in the air a six percent increase in cardiopulmonary deaths occurs according to research by the American Cancer Society. Exhaust from the burning of diesel fuel is a complex mixture of vapors, gases, and fine particles, including over 40 known pollutants like nitrogen oxide and known or suspected carcinogenic substances such as benzene, arsenic, and formaldehyde. Exposure to [[diesel exhaust]] irritates the eyes, nose, throat and lungs, causing coughs, headaches, light-headedness and nausea, while causing people with allergies to be more susceptible allergy triggers like dust or pollen. Many particles in disease fuel are so tiny they are able to penetrate deep into the lungs when inhaled.  Importantly, diesel fuel particles appear to have even greater immunologic effects in the presence of environmental allergens than they do alone.  \"This immunologic evidence may help explain the epidemiologic studies indicating that children living along major trucking thoroughfares are at increased risk for asthmatic and allergic symptoms and are more likely to have respiratory dysfunction.\" according to Robert Pandya and co-workers.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe damaging effects of diesel fuel pollution go beyond a synergistic role in asthma development. Exposure to a combination of microscopic diesel fuel particles among people with high blood cholesterol (i.e., [[low-density lipoprotein]], LDL or \"bad cholesterol\") increases the risk for both heart attack and stroke above levels found among those exposed to only one of these health risks.  According to [[Andr\u00e9 Nel]], Chief of Nanomedicine at the [[David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA]], \"When you add one plus one, it normally totals two... But we found that adding diesel particles to cholesterol fats equals three. Their combination creates a dangerous synergy that wreaks cardiovascular havoc far beyond what's caused by the diesel or cholesterol alone.\"  Experimentation revealed that the two mechanisms worked in tandem to stimulate genes that promote cell inflammation, a primary risk for hardening and blockage of blood vessels ([[atherosclerosis]]) and, as narrowed arteries collect cholesterol deposits and trigger blood clots, for [[heart attacks]] and [[strokes]] as well.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n==Mathematical modelling==\nA [[mathematical model]] is a simplified representation using mathematical language to describe natural, mechanical or social system dynamics. Epidemiological modelers unite several types of information and analytic capacity, including: 1) mathematical equations and computational algorithms; 2) computer technology; 3) epidemiological knowledge about [[infectious disease dynamics]], including information about specific pathogens and disease [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]]; and 4) research data on social conditions and human behavior.  [[Mathematical modelling in epidemiology]] is now being applied to syndemics.\n\nFor example, modelling to quantify the syndemic effects of malaria and HIV in sub-Saharan Africa based on research in Kisumu, Kenya researchers found that 5% of HIV infections (or 8,500 cases of HIV since 1980) in Kisumu are the result of the higher HIV infectiousness of malaria-infected HIV patients.  Additionally, their model attributed 10% of adult malaria episodes (or almost one million excess malaria infections since 1980) to the greater susceptibility of HIV infected individuals to malaria.  Their model also suggests that HIV has contributed to the wider geographic spread of malaria in Africa, a process previously thought to be the consequence primarily of global warming.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Abu-Raddad Laith |author2=Patnaik P. |author3=Kublin J | year = 2006 | title = Dual Infection with HIV and Malaria Fuels the Spread of Both Diseases in sub-Saharan Africa | url = | journal = Science | volume = 314 | issue = 5805| pages = 1603\u20131606 | doi=10.1126/science.1132338 | pmid=17158329|bibcode=2006Sci...314.1603A }}</ref>  Modelling offers an enormously useful tool for anticipating future syndemics, including eco-syndemic, based on information about the spread of various diseases across the planet and the consequent co-infections and disease interactions that will result.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Herring D.

PopMod is used as one of the standard tools of the World Health Organization's ([[WHO]]) CHOICE (Choosing Interventions that are Cost-Effective) program, an initiative designed to provide national health policymakers in the WHO's 14 epidemiological sub-regions around the world with findings on a range of health intervention costs and effects.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Lauer Jeremy |author2=R\u00f6hrich Klaus |author3=Wirth Harald |author4=Charette Claude |author5=Gribble Steve |author6=Murray Christopher | year = 2003 | title = PopMod: a longitudinal population model with two interacting disease states | journal = Cost Effectiveness and Resource Allocation | volume = 1 | issue = 1| page = 6 | pmc=156025 | pmid=12773215|doi=10.1186/1478-7547-1-6 }}</ref>\n\nAlthough in Merrill Singer's conceptual work on syndemics the study of disease interaction is a central issue, most empirically based research studies have not used appropriate statistical models to do so.

There is a need to identify all of the ways, directly and indirectly, that diseases can interact and have, as a result, enhanced impact on human health. Third there is a need for the development of an '''eco-syndemic''' understanding of the ways in which [[global warming]] contributes to the spread of diseases and new disease interactions. \nThere is a need for a better understanding of how public health systems and communities can best respond to and limit the health consequences of syndemics. Systems are needed to monitor the emergence of syndemics and to allow early medical and public health responses to lessen their impact. Systematic ethno-epidemiological surveillance with populations subject to multiple social stressors must be one component of such a monitoring system.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Endemic (epidemiology)|Endemic]]\n* [[List of epidemics]]\n* [[List of human diseases associated with infectious pathogens]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading==\n\n===Books===\n* Marshall, Mac 2013 ''Drinking Smoke: The Tobacco Syndemic in Oceania.''
