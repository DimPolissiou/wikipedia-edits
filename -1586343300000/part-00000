{"title_page": "1919 Auckland Rugby League season", "text_new": "The 1919 season of the [[Auckland Rugby League]] was its 11th. It was the first season post [[World War I]] and unsurprisingly it saw a resurgence in playing numbers with 56 teams across the six grades. [[North Shore Albions]] who had previously dropped out of the senior competition again fielded a senior side. As did [[Otahuhu Leopards|Otahuhu]], who had dropped out during the 1917 season.  In addition a new club was formed, namely [[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]]. They were composed of old boys of the Marist Brothers\u2019 schools.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Marist Bros. Old Boys/New Club Formed\n| page =9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17144\n| date = 1919-04-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190425.2.120.2\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref> The senior club season commenced on the 3rd of May.\n\n[[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] won their third consecutive first grade title, while [[Newton Rangers]] won the Roope Rooster trophy.\n\nAt the end of the season J.B. Cooke stated in a meeting that next season the ball would be rolled into scrums and forwards would have to keep their feet on the ground while the halfback was putting the ball in. These changes were to \u201cbrighten the game\u201d.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Visit of English Team\n| page =4\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17253\n| date = 1919-09-01\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190901.2.9.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-20}}</ref>\n\nThe season was also summarised by the league as well. Forty-nine teams were entered across all grades. Sunnyside won the second grade, Manukau won the third grade, City won the fourth and fifty grades, while Ponsonby won the sixth grade. It was stated that the standard of play in the senior club competition was not as good as it would have been due to the fact that 19 of the best club players from Auckland were away for a large part of the season representing New Zealand in Australia.\n\n===Representative Season===\nThe Auckland representative team was only able to play one inter provincial fixture against Hawkes Bay after matches with Canterbury and Wellington were unable to be scheduled due to the busy New Zealand representative schedule. Likewise Ponsonby were unable to schedule a defense of the Thacker Shield for the same reason. An Auckland Junior team was however able to make a trip out to Napier to play Hawkes Bay and they were victorious by 12 points to 5. Auckland played a match in front of an enormous crowd at the Auckland Domain against the touring Australian side but did not fair any better than the New Zealand national side, going down by 32 points to 8.\n\n===Charitable Efforts and League Funds===\nDuring the war most of the revenue gained by Auckland Rugby League was donated to the war efforts meaning they could not make much progress financially towards developing the game and facilities. In 1919 they once again raised 75 pounds to distribute to local charities nominated by the mayor. They also put on a match at the end of the season to raise money for the St. John Ambulance Brigade. Due to the large crowds at some of the matches, including the match with Australia it was anticipated that the league would gain over 1,000 pounds to establish a fund for obtaining a playing ground. This would of course be [[Carlaw Park]].<ref>{{cite news \n| title =An Eventful Season/Record Gate Receipts\n| page =10\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17291\n| date = 1919-10-15\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19191015.2.116\n| accessdate = 2020-02-10}}</ref>\n\n===Eden Ramblers No More===\nAt the Auckland Rugby League meeting on April 30 it was announced that the Eden Ramblers club had been disbanded.

Shore and Maritime when in fact it was Newton who were supposed to be the opponent. As a result, Newton players did not arrive at the ground. Eventually Newton found enough substitutes but they still began the game 2-3 players short. In spite of this they still managed to win by 14 points to 9. Also the City team took the field with 6 juniors while Grafton had 2 juniors and played a man short. The chief issue was with the New Zealand team touring Australia at the time meaning many key players were absent from their club teams.\n\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 31 May\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Newton\n| score = 14-9\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Newton Defeats North Shore/Newton V North Shore\n| page =8\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17176\n| date = 1919-06-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190602.2.119.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-19}}</ref>| away = North Shore\n| try1 = A Isles, Keenan 2, [[George Isles]]\n| con1 =\n| pen1 = A Isles\n| try2 = Ernie Bailey\n| con2 = McAneny\n| pen2 = McAneny & 1 mark\n| stadium = Victoria Park 1\n| attendance = 2500\n| referee = A Ball\n}}\n \n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 31 May\n| time = 3:00\n| home = City\n| score = 25-2\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Grafton Outpointed by City/City V Grafton\n| page =8\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17176\n| date = 1919-06-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190602.2.119.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-19}}</ref>| away = Grafton\n| try1 = Hogan, H Wynn, Cole, Asher, [[Jim Clark (rugby league)|Jim Clark]] 2, G Reed\n| con1 = Asher 2\n| pen1 =\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 = W Ghent\n| stadium = Victoria Park 2\n| attendance = 2500\n| referee = [[William Wynyard (rugby league)|William Wynyard]]\n}}\n \n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 31 May\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Ponsonby\n| score = Postponed\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Newton Defeats North Shore\n| page =8\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17176\n| date = 1919-06-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190602.2.119.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-19}}</ref>| away = Marist\n| try1 =\n| con1 =\n| pen1 =\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 =\n| stadium =\n| attendance =\n| referee =\n}}\n\n===Round 5===\nIn the match at Devonport the Marist team was led from the field by their captain with the score at 9-0 to North Shore in protest at a refereeing decision.

\n===Round 10===\nRound 10 featured two rarities.

When matches were normally played at the same venue they all were played at the same time of 3pm on adjacent fields. In the 3rd match due to be played on the Domain the referee, F Thompson failed to turn up and after waiting for 40 minutes the decision was made to abandon the game. It was later revealed that he had been called away on an urgent business matter and had tried to contact the league but been unable to. The Auckland Rugby League accepted his explanation. The round was also significant for another reason. [[Craddock Dufty]] also debuted for Newton and kicked 2 conversions.

It was the first season post [[World War I]] and unsurprisingly it saw a resurgence in playing numbers with 56 teams across the six grades. [[North Shore Albions]] who had previously dropped out of the senior competition again fielded a senior side. As did [[Otahuhu Leopards|Otahuhu]], who had dropped out during the 1917 season.  In addition a new club was formed, namely [[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]]. They were composed of old boys of the Marist Brothers\u2019 schools.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Marist Bros. Old Boys/New Club Formed\n| page =9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17144\n| date = 1919-04-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190425.2.120.2\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref> The senior club season commenced on the 3rd of May.\n\n[[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] won their third consecutive first grade title, while [[Newton Rangers]] won the Roope Rooster trophy.\n\nAt the end of the season J.B. Cooke stated in a meeting that next season the ball would be rolled into scrums and forwards would have to keep their feet on the ground while the halfback was putting the ball in. These changes were to \u201cbrighten the game\u201d.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Visit of English Team\n| page =4\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17253\n| date = 1919-09-01\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190901.2.9.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-20}}</ref>\n\nThe season was also summarised by the league as well. Forty-nine teams were entered across all grades. Sunnyside won the second grade, Manukau won the third grade, City won the fourth and fifty grades, while Ponsonby won the sixth grade. It was stated that the standard of play in the senior club competition was not as good as it would have been due to the fact that 19 of the best club players from Auckland were away for a large part of the season representing New Zealand in Australia.\n\n===Representative Season===\nThe Auckland representative team was only able to play one inter provincial fixture against Hawkes Bay after matches with Canterbury and Wellington were unable to be scheduled due to the busy New Zealand representative schedule. Likewise Ponsonby were unable to schedule a defense of the Thacker Shield for the same reason. An Auckland Junior team was however able to make a trip out to Napier to play Hawkes Bay and they were victorious by 12 points to 5. Auckland played a match in front of an enormous crowd at the Auckland Domain against the touring Australian side but did not fair any better than the New Zealand national side, going down by 32 points to 8.\n\n===Charitable Efforts and League Funds===\nDuring the war most of the revenue gained by Auckland Rugby League was donated to the war efforts meaning they could not make much progress financially towards developing the game and facilities. In 1919 they once again raised 75 pounds to distribute to local charities nominated by the mayor. They also put on a match at the end of the season to raise money for the St. John Ambulance Brigade. Due to the large crowds at some of the matches, including the match with Australia it was anticipated that the league would gain over 1,000 pounds to establish a fund for obtaining a playing ground. This would of course be [[Carlaw Park]].<ref>{{cite news \n| title =An Eventful Season/Record Gate Receipts\n| page =10\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17291\n| date = 1919-10-15\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19191015.2.116\n| accessdate = 2020-02-10}}</ref>\n\n===Eden Ramblers No More===\nAt the Auckland Rugby League meeting on April 30 it was announced that the Eden Ramblers club had been disbanded.

In spite of this they still managed to win by 14 points to 9. Also the City team took the field with 6 juniors while Grafton had 2 juniors and played a man short.

When matches were normally played at the same venue they all were played at the same time of 3pm on adjacent fields. In the 3rd match due to be played on the Domain the referee, F Thompson failed to turn up and after waiting for 40 minutes the decision was made to abandon the game. It was later revealed that he had been called away on an urgent business matter and had tried to contact the league but been unable to. The Auckland Rugby League accepted his explanation. The round was also significant for another reason. [[Craddock Dufty]] also debuted for Newton and kicked 2 conversions. He was to go on to represent New Zealand 12 times along with touring with the New Zealand Maori side.\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 12 July\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Ponsonby\n| score = 3-3\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =A Tight Struggle/Maritime 3, Ponsonby 3\n| page =8\n| publisher =Auckland Star, Volume L, Issue 166\n| date = 1919-07-14\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19190714.2.96\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>\n| away = Maritime\n| try1 = A Cadman\n| con1 =\n| pen1 =\n| try2 = [[Bert Avery]]\n| con2 =\n| pen2 =\n| stadium = Auckland Domain 1\n| attendance =\n| referee = W Murray\n}}\n \n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 12 July\n| time = 1:30\n| home = Newton\n| score = 22-0\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Newton Vanquishes Shore\n| page =8\n| publisher =Auckland Star, Volume L, Issue 166\n| date = 1919-07-14\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19190714.2.96\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>\n| away = North Shore\n| try1 = Iles 3, McSweeney 2, Condon\n| con1 = [[Craddock Dufty]] 2\n| pen1 =\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 =\n| stadium = Auckland Domain\n| attendance =\n| referee =\n}}\n \n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 12 July\n| time = 3:00\n| home = City\n| score = Abandoned\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =A Tight Struggle/Maritime 3, Ponsonby 3/Newton Vanquishes Shore\n| page =8\n| publisher =Auckland Star, Volume L, Issue 166\n| date = 1919-07-14\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19190714.2.96\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>\n| away = Marist\n| try1 =\n| con1 =\n| pen1 =\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 =\n| stadium = Auckland Domain\n| attendance =\n| referee = F Thompson (did not arrive)\n}}\n\n===Round 4 Postponed Match===\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 20 July\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Ponsonby\n| score = 11-2\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Under League Rules/Ponsonby 11, Marist Old Boys 2/A Well Contested Game\n| page = 5\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17218\n| date = 1919-07-22\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190722.2.26\n| accessdate = 2020-02-12}}</ref>\n| away = Marist\n| try1 = E McGregor, A Cross, S Chatfield\n| con1 = Unknown x 1\n| pen1 =\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 = Unknown x 1\n| stadium = Victoria Park\n| attendance =\n| referee =\n}}\n\n==Roope Rooster Knockout Competition==\nThe round 1 match between [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] and [[Newton Rangers]] was abandoned towards the end with [[Newton Rangers|Newton]] leading by 12 points to 10 after [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] supporters encroached on the field in protest against the referee and refused to move back.

This was the first commercial PCS network in the United States. Although the current Sprint PCS service is [[CDMA2000|CDMA]], the original Washington-area network used [[GSM]]. Eventually, Sprint launched its new nationwide CDMA network, then in 1999 sold the decommissioned GSM infrastructure to Omnipoint which re-launched in May 2000.

Sprint Nextel was formed on August 13, 2005, when the deal was completed.\n\nSprint and Nextel faced opposition to the merger, mostly from regional affiliates that provided wireless services on behalf of the companies. These regional affiliates felt that the new company would be violating non-compete agreements that the former companies had made with the affiliates.\n\nOn September 1, 2005, Sprint Nextel combined plan offerings of its Sprint and Nextel brands to bring uniformity across the company's offerings.\n\nNextel has licensed its identity to [[NII Holdings, Inc.]], of which Sprint Nextel owned 18%. NII has used the Nextel brand to set up networks in many Latin American countries. Following Sprint's purchase of Nextel, Nextel sold all of its investment in NII Holdings.\n\nThe integration process was difficult due to disparate network technologies. Sprint tried to address this with the advent of [[PowerSource (phone brand)|PowerSource]] phones. These phones routed voice call and data services over Sprint's [[Personal Communications Service|PCS]] spectrum while maintaining DirectConnect services over 800&nbsp;MHz spectrum. However, this was not sufficient in coverage, due to the inability to roam on a non-PCS spectrum. Soon after the merger, top Nextel Executives began leaving the company immediately after the merger closed. Tim Donahue, the Nextel CEO, stayed on as executive chairman, but ceded decision-making authority to [[Gary D. Forsee]]. Tom Kelly, COO of Nextel, took an interim staff position as Chief Strategy Officer. Two years after the merger, only a few key Nextel executives remained, with many former Nextel middle- and upper-level managers having left, citing reasons including the unbridgeable cultural difference between the two companies.\n\nIn 2006, Sprint spun off its local telephone operations, including the former United Telephone companies and [[Centel]], as [[Embarq]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Sprint, CWA Reach Deal Over Embarq Spinoff |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB113983967845572443 |website=Wall Street Journal |accessdate=February 13, 2006}}</ref>\n\nSprint's acquisition of Nextel was a disaster from a fiscal standpoint in 2008, the company [[Write-off|wrote down]] $29.7&nbsp;billion of the $36&nbsp;billion sum it had paid for Nextel in 2005, wiping out 80 percent of the value of Nextel at the time it had been acquired.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gigaom.com/2008/02/28/sprint-writes-down-nextel-posts-295-billion-loss/|title=Sprint Writes Down Nextel, Posts $29.5 Billion Loss|last=Malik|first=Om|date=February 28, 2008|publisher=Gigaom|page=1|accessdate=July 9, 2011}}</ref> The write down reflected the depreciation in Nextel's [[Goodwill (accounting)|goodwill]] since the date of acquisition.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=awQZDoY8w00M&refer=home|title=Sprint Posts $29.5 Billion Loss on Nextel Writedown|last=Harrison|first=Crayton|date=February 28, 2008|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|accessdate=July 9, 2011 |archivedate=November 5, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105191249/https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=awQZDoY8w00M&refer=home}}</ref>\n\n====Affiliate acquisitions and settlements====\nPrior to their merger, Sprint and Nextel were dependent on a network of affiliated companies. Following the announcement of the merger agreement, some of these affiliates came forward with strong opposition to the Sprint-Nextel merger on the grounds that the merged company might violate existing agreements or significantly undercut earnings to these affiliates. In order for Sprint Nextel to allay some of this opposition, they initiated discussions of either acquiring some of these affiliates or renegotiating existing agreements. In several cases, the newly formed company was forced to acquire affiliated companies in exchange for their dropping their opposition to the merger. Forsee said that the company would likely have to acquire all of its remaining affiliates.\n\nIn 2005, Sprint Nextel acquired three of its ten wireless affiliates: US Unwired, acquired in August; Gulf Coast Wireless, acquired in October; and IWO Holdings, acquired in October. Alamosa PCS, which Sprint Nextel acquired on February 2, 2006, was the largest of its affiliate carriers. Other acquired affiliates include Ubiquitel, iPCS, Enterprise, and Northern.

SPG's branded products and services are sold via web and available at retailers nationwide, including [[Best Buy]], [[Walmart]], [[Target Corporation|Target]] and other independent dealers.\n\n==== Boost Mobile ====\n{{Main|Boost Mobile}}\nBoost Worldwide, Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of Sprint that provides nationwide, prepaid wireless voice, messaging and broadband data products and services to customers in the [[contiguous United States]] under the Boost Mobile brand. The services are provided as an MVNO hosted on the Sprint-owned [[Code-division multiple access|CDMA]], [[Evolution-Data Optimized|EVDO]], [[WiMAX]], [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]], and [[LTE Advanced]] networks.\n\n===Sprint Smart Velocity===\nSprint Velocity was Sprint Corporation's Connected Vehicle Platform, announced in 2012 in partnership with Chrysler.\n\n== Wireless wholesale operations and affiliates==\nSprint Corporation provides services using both its own spectrum and network equipment through affiliate agreements. Smaller affiliated companies operate their own network assets and retail operations but offer services to customers in their geographic region under the Sprint brand.\n\nIn the early stages of network build-out, the company relied significantly on network partners known as affiliates to rapidly expand its coverage. These affiliates would lease Sprint's PCS spectrum licenses in a specific geographic area, typically rural areas, and smaller cities, and provide wireless service using the Sprint brand. Sprint provided back-end support such as billing and telephone-based customer service, while the affiliates built and maintained the network, sold equipment to customers, and staffed the retail stores in their specific regions. Its customers could \"roam\" across Sprint-operated and affiliate-operated portions of the network without being aware of the distinction, and vice versa. Outwardly, efforts were made to make it appear as if the network was operated by a single entity under the Sprint name, though complex revenue-sharing agreements were in place which was very similar in nature to cross-carrier roaming tariffs. In later years, the relationship between Sprint and its affiliates grew contentious, particularly after Sprint's acquisition of Nextel. Various affiliates included Swiftel Communications in Brookings, South Dakota;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swiftel.net/|title=Swiftel.net - Quality, reliable & local phone + TV + Internet service is what we do.|publisher=|accessdate=August 6, 2015}}</ref> [[Shentel]] in northern Virginia, and parts of Pennsylvania, Maryland, and West Virginia.\n\n===Sprint Rural Alliance===\n\nSprint Rural Alliance (SRA) members (aka Sprint Partners) are carriers who use their own equipment and also sell their own service under their own name while using Sprint spectrum. Sprint is given access to the SRA network in return for allowing the use of Sprint spectrum. This allows Sprint to keep the spectrum license for the geographic area being served by the SRA member. Alaska DigiTel in [[Alaska]] is a current SRA Member. Former SRA Members include Alltel Wireless in [[Montana]]; This portion of the network was obtained by [[AT&T]] during the merger of [[Alltel]] and [[Verizon Wireless]], Pioneer Cellular in [[Kansas]] and [[Oklahoma]]; they ended their agreement with Sprint on March 1, 2012, and have since transitioned to an agreement with Verizon Wireless through the LTE in Rural America program, [[nTelos]]; operated in [[West Virginia]] and was bought out and merged with [[Shentel]] which is a Sprint Affiliate.\n\n===Mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs)===\n\nSprint Corporation provides wholesales capacity on its CDMA2000, EVDO, and LTE wireless networks to [[mobile virtual network operator]]s (MVNOs), which allows other wireless providers to utilize its networks to offer its services. Sprint's prepaid brands also operate using Sprint's networks, however, they are not MVNOs, but rather wholly owned prepaid subsidiaries of the company.\n\n====Bring Your Own Sprint Device====\n\nSprint Corporation allows certain Sprint MVNOs to accept and activate old Sprint-branded phones through its \"Bring Your Own Sprint Device\" program which was established for Sprint's initiative to further reduce the number of cell phones that are thrown away each year. The program is also beneficial to MVNOs customers who do not want to pay subsidized prices.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://newsroom.sprint.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=2525 |title=Sprint Gives MVNOs an Alternative to Phone Subsidies Through \"Bring Your Own Sprint Device\" Program &#124; Sprint Newsroom |publisher=Newsroom.sprint.com |accessdate=July 11, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522110417/http://newsroom.sprint.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=2525 |archive-date=May 22, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n====Custom Branded Device Program====\n\nSprint Corporation offers its MVNOs a program called the \"Custom Branded Device Program\", which gives MVNOs access to completely unbranded Android smartphones with no references to Sprint that the MVNO can then customize with its own branded apps and services through Sprint's Mobile ID and Mobile Zone products.

Sprint has an LTE roaming agreement with [[AT&T]] as well, which is typically limited to 3G speeds.  Several cases of Sprint phones simultaneously roaming on Verizon's CDMA network for voice and AT&T's LTE network for data have been observed in 2017.\n\nIn 2018 with the announcement of the Sprint and T-Mobile merger, Sprint gained access to roaming on T-Mobile's LTE network for 4 years.

Later in 1995, the company began to offer wireless service under the Sprint Spectrum brand in the [[Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area]]. This was the first commercial PCS network in the United States. Although the current Sprint PCS service is [[CDMA2000|CDMA]], the original Washington-area network used [[GSM]]. Eventually, Sprint launched its new nationwide CDMA network, then in 1999 sold the decommissioned GSM infrastructure to Omnipoint which re-launched in May 2000. Omnipoint was later acquired by VoiceStream Wireless, which eventually became part of [[T-Mobile USA]].\n\n===Partnerships and more consolidation===\nIn September 1996, Sprint announced a deal with [[RadioShack]], and in 1997, Sprint stores opened at RadioShack to offer communications services and products across the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/RadioShack-Sprint-Team-Up-Phone-outlets-to-2805441.php|title=RadioShack, Sprint Team Up / Phone outlets to open today inside retailer|last=Marshall|first=Jonathan|date=September 24, 1997|website=SFGate|access-date=April 26, 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn October 5, 1999, Sprint and [[MCI WorldCom]] announced a $129 billion merger agreement between the two companies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://money.cnn.com/1999/10/05/worldbiz/sprint_mci/|title=MCI buys Sprint for $129B - Oct. 5, 1999|website=money.cnn.com|access-date=April 26, 2019}}</ref> The deal would have been the largest corporate merger in history at the time.

Sprint Nextel was formed on August 13, 2005, when the deal was completed.\n\nSprint and Nextel faced opposition to the merger, mostly from regional affiliates that provided wireless services on behalf of the companies. These regional affiliates felt that the new company would be violating non-compete agreements that the former companies had made with the affiliates.\n\nOn September 1, 2005, Sprint Nextel combined plan offerings of its Sprint and Nextel brands to bring uniformity across the company's offerings.\n\nNextel has licensed its identity to [[NII Holdings, Inc.]], of which Sprint Nextel owned 18%. NII has used the Nextel brand to set up networks in many Latin American countries. Following Sprint's purchase of Nextel, Nextel sold all of its investment in NII Holdings.\n\nThe integration process was difficult due to disparate network technologies. Sprint tried to address this with the advent of [[PowerSource (phone brand)|PowerSource]] phones. These phones routed voice call and data services over Sprint's [[Personal Communications Service|PCS]] spectrum while maintaining DirectConnect services over 800&nbsp;MHz spectrum. However, this was not sufficient in coverage, due to the inability to roam on a non-PCS spectrum. Soon after the merger, top Nextel Executives began leaving the company immediately after the merger closed. Tim Donahue, the Nextel CEO, stayed on as executive chairman, but ceded decision-making authority to [[Gary D. Forsee]]. Tom Kelly, COO of Nextel, took an interim staff position as Chief Strategy Officer. Two years after the merger, only a few key Nextel executives remained, with many former Nextel middle- and upper-level managers having left, citing reasons including the unbridgeable cultural difference between the two companies.\n\nIn 2006, Sprint spun off its local telephone operations, including the former United Telephone companies and [[Centel]], as [[Embarq]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Sprint, CWA Reach Deal Over Embarq Spinoff |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB113983967845572443 |website=Wall Street Journal |accessdate=February 13, 2006}}</ref>\n\nSprint's acquisition of Nextel was a disaster from a fiscal standpoint in 2008, the company [[Write-off|wrote down]] $29.7&nbsp;billion of the $36&nbsp;billion sum it had paid for Nextel in 2005, wiping out 80 percent of the value of Nextel at the time it had been acquired.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gigaom.com/2008/02/28/sprint-writes-down-nextel-posts-295-billion-loss/|title=Sprint Writes Down Nextel, Posts $29.5 Billion Loss|last=Malik|first=Om|date=February 28, 2008|publisher=Gigaom|page=1|accessdate=July 9, 2011}}</ref> The write down reflected the depreciation in Nextel's [[Goodwill (accounting)|goodwill]] since the date of acquisition.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=awQZDoY8w00M&refer=home|title=Sprint Posts $29.5 Billion Loss on Nextel Writedown|last=Harrison|first=Crayton|date=February 28, 2008|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|accessdate=July 9, 2011 |archivedate=November 5, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105191249/https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=awQZDoY8w00M&refer=home}}</ref>\n\n====Affiliate acquisitions and settlements====\nPrior to their merger, Sprint and Nextel were dependent on a network of affiliated companies. Following the announcement of the merger agreement, some of these affiliates came forward with strong opposition to the Sprint-Nextel merger on the grounds that the merged company might violate existing agreements or significantly undercut earnings to these affiliates. In order for Sprint Nextel to allay some of this opposition, they initiated discussions of either acquiring some of these affiliates or renegotiating existing agreements. In several cases, the newly formed company was forced to acquire affiliated companies in exchange for their dropping their opposition to the merger. Forsee said that the company would likely have to acquire all of its remaining affiliates.\n\nIn 2005, Sprint Nextel acquired three of its ten wireless affiliates: US Unwired, acquired in August; Gulf Coast Wireless, acquired in October; and IWO Holdings, acquired in October. Alamosa PCS, which Sprint Nextel acquired on February 2, 2006, was the largest of its affiliate carriers. Other acquired affiliates include Ubiquitel, iPCS, Enterprise, and Northern.

Sprint is in the process of upgrading these services from a TDM network to an IP based network<ref>http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2016/db0824/DA-16-963A1.pdf</ref>\n\n==Wireless operations==\n[[File:Sprint store on TV Highway - Hillsboro, Oregon.JPG|thumb|This \"Sprint Store by ccComm\" located in [[Hillsboro, Oregon]] sells Sprint-branded wireless products and services exclusively.]]\n\n===Sprint branded services===\nSprint Corporation offers postpaid wireless voice and data services primarily under the Sprint brand.\n\n=== Sprint Prepaid Group ===\nThe Sprint Prepaid Group is a division of the company formed in May 2010 that is responsible for the operations of Sprint's pre-pay subsidiaries. SPG's branded products and services are sold via web and available at retailers nationwide, including [[Best Buy]], [[Walmart]], [[Target Corporation|Target]] and other independent dealers.\n\n==== Boost Mobile ====\n{{Main|Boost Mobile}}\nBoost Worldwide, Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of Sprint that provides nationwide, prepaid wireless voice, messaging and broadband data products and services to customers in the [[contiguous United States]] under the Boost Mobile brand. The services are provided as an MVNO hosted on the Sprint-owned [[Code-division multiple access|CDMA]], [[Evolution-Data Optimized|EVDO]], [[WiMAX]], [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]], and [[LTE Advanced]] networks.\n\n===Sprint Smart Velocity===\nSprint Velocity was Sprint Corporation's Connected Vehicle Platform, announced in 2012 in partnership with Chrysler.\n\n== Wireless wholesale operations and affiliates==\nSprint Corporation provides services using both its own spectrum and network equipment through affiliate agreements. Smaller affiliated companies operate their own network assets and retail operations but offer services to customers in their geographic region under the Sprint brand.\n\nIn the early stages of network build-out, the company relied significantly on network partners known as affiliates to rapidly expand its coverage. These affiliates would lease Sprint's PCS spectrum licenses in a specific geographic area, typically rural areas, and smaller cities, and provide wireless service using the Sprint brand. Sprint provided back-end support such as billing and telephone-based customer service, while the affiliates built and maintained the network, sold equipment to customers, and staffed the retail stores in their specific regions. Its customers could \"roam\" across Sprint-operated and affiliate-operated portions of the network without being aware of the distinction, and vice versa. Outwardly, efforts were made to make it appear as if the network was operated by a single entity under the Sprint name, though complex revenue-sharing agreements were in place which was very similar in nature to cross-carrier roaming tariffs. In later years, the relationship between Sprint and its affiliates grew contentious, particularly after Sprint's acquisition of Nextel. Various affiliates included Swiftel Communications in Brookings, South Dakota;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swiftel.net/|title=Swiftel.net - Quality, reliable & local phone + TV + Internet service is what we do.|publisher=|accessdate=August 6, 2015}}</ref> [[Shentel]] in northern Virginia, and parts of Pennsylvania, Maryland, and West Virginia.\n\n===Sprint Rural Alliance===\n\nSprint Rural Alliance (SRA) members (aka Sprint Partners) are carriers who use their own equipment and also sell their own service under their own name while using Sprint spectrum. Sprint is given access to the SRA network in return for allowing the use of Sprint spectrum. This allows Sprint to keep the spectrum license for the geographic area being served by the SRA member. Alaska DigiTel in [[Alaska]] is a current SRA Member. Former SRA Members include Alltel Wireless in [[Montana]]; This portion of the network was obtained by [[AT&T]] during the merger of [[Alltel]] and [[Verizon Wireless]], Pioneer Cellular in [[Kansas]] and [[Oklahoma]]; they ended their agreement with Sprint on March 1, 2012, and have since transitioned to an agreement with Verizon Wireless through the LTE in Rural America program, [[nTelos]]; operated in [[West Virginia]] and was bought out and merged with [[Shentel]] which is a Sprint Affiliate.\n\n===Mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs)===\n\nSprint Corporation provides wholesales capacity on its CDMA2000, EVDO, and LTE wireless networks to [[mobile virtual network operator]]s (MVNOs), which allows other wireless providers to utilize its networks to offer its services. Sprint's prepaid brands also operate using Sprint's networks, however, they are not MVNOs, but rather wholly owned prepaid subsidiaries of the company.\n\n====Bring Your Own Sprint Device====\n\nSprint Corporation allows certain Sprint MVNOs to accept and activate old Sprint-branded phones through its \"Bring Your Own Sprint Device\" program which was established for Sprint's initiative to further reduce the number of cell phones that are thrown away each year. The program is also beneficial to MVNOs customers who do not want to pay subsidized prices.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://newsroom.sprint.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=2525 |title=Sprint Gives MVNOs an Alternative to Phone Subsidies Through \"Bring Your Own Sprint Device\" Program &#124; Sprint Newsroom |publisher=Newsroom.sprint.com |accessdate=July 11, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522110417/http://newsroom.sprint.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=2525 |archive-date=May 22, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n====Custom Branded Device Program====\n\nSprint Corporation offers its MVNOs a program called the \"Custom Branded Device Program\", which gives MVNOs access to completely unbranded Android smartphones with no references to Sprint that the MVNO can then customize with its own branded apps and services through Sprint's Mobile ID and Mobile Zone products.

Sprint has an LTE roaming agreement with [[AT&T]] as well, which is typically limited to 3G speeds.  Several cases of Sprint phones simultaneously roaming on Verizon's CDMA network for voice and AT&T's LTE network for data have been observed in 2017.\n\nIn 2018 with the announcement of the Sprint and T-Mobile merger, Sprint gained access to roaming on T-Mobile's LTE network for 4 years.
