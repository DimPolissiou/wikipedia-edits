Born in [[Clifton, Bristol]], he graduated from the [[University of Paris]] in 1894, and travelled to the [[Transvaal Colony]] where, as a member of [[Milner's Kindergarten]], he became Director of Education. Ware next became editor of the [[The Morning Post|''Morning Post'']], being fired in 1911 after several controversies.\n\nWhen the [[First World War]] started in August 1914, Ware attempted to join the [[British Army]] but was rejected because he was too old. With the assistance of [[Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner|Lord Milner]], he obtained command of a mobile [[ambulance]] unit provided by the [[British Red Cross Society]]. In this role he began marking and recording the graves of those killed. Ware and his graves' registration organization were transferred to the [[British Army]] in 1915. This was to become the Imperial War Graves Commission. Ware ended the war as a major general, having been [[mentioned in despatches]] twice and continued to work with the commission. In [[World War II]], he was appointed director-general of Graves Registration and Enquiries. He fully retired in 1948, and died the following year.\n==Early life==\nWare was born in [[Clifton, Bristol]] on 17 June 1869,<ref name=\"Veterans Agency\">{{cite web|url=http://www.veterans-uk.info/remembrance/ware.html|title=Major General Sir Fabian Ware|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[Veterans Agency|Ministry of Defence Veterans Agency]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112162637/http://www.veterans-uk.info/remembrance/ware.html|archive-date=12 November 2014|accessdate=7 November 2015}}</ref> to Charles Ware, a chartered accountant, and his wife, Amy Carew, {{Nee}} Goulstone.<ref name= \"ODNB\">{{cite ODNB|title=Ware, Sir Fabian Arthur Goulstone|id=3674|ref=harv|date=2008|first=A.

That spring he began serving as an intermediary between the French and British governments over grave-related matters. The organization began handling requests at a headquarters in [[Lillers]], and the sections worked on grave maintenance. The organization was soon exempted from a ban on [[War photography|photography]] and a department of three photographers was created to photograph graves; by mid-August, six thousand graves had been photographed and eight hundred photographs sent to families. A further 18,173 graves had been registered. Around the same time Ware became unable to continue work with the Mobile Ambulance Unit, and began to solely focus on the commission. On 6 September Macready recommended transferring the organization completely to the Army; the transfer was completed by late October.{{Sfn|Crane|2013|p=|pp=50\u201352, 54\u201356, 59}}  \n\nIn his role in the commission, wares served as \"the sole [[intermediary]] between the British Army in the Field and the French Military and Civil Authorities in all matters relating to graves.\"{{Sfn|War Graves|1929|p=15}} Throughout 1915 and 1916, Ware led negotiations between France and Britain, resolving various issues, particularly that of [[land expropriation]]. Around June 1915, his efforts resulted in an 'expropriation bill' that began to be debated by the French government. Ware shepherded the bill through its passage, urging prominent figures such as the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]], the [[Adjutant-General to the Forces|Adjutant-General]], the [[King of the United Kingdom|King]], and the editor of the ''Times'' to support it.{{Sfn|Crane|2013|p=|pp=59, 64}} The law passed the French government on 29 December 1917.{{Sfn|Documents of the NYS Assembly|1918|p=548}} It gave Britain the ability to control their war graves in \"perpetuity of [[sepulture]]\"{{Sfn|Miles|2017|p=51}} and provided for the establishment of a British authority to manage the cemeteries.{{Sfn|Crane|2013|p=65}} \n\nWhen [[William Glynne Charles Gladstone]], a [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] and the grandson of former Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]], was [[killed in action]] near [[Laventie]] on 13 April 1915, his family attempted to have the body [[Exhumation|exhumed]] and returned to England.

For example, [[Lionel Earle]], a member of the International War Graves Committee, objected to the Army's practice of marking the graves of [[deserters]] with unmarked wooden crosses. As a result the custom was abolished. In 1916, efforts to neaten the cemeteries began. Ware invited [[Arthur William Hill]], then assistant director of the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]], to tour the cemeteries and advise upon further planting efforts in early 1915.{{Sfn|Crane|2013|p=|pp=88\u201389}} In the [[1917 New Year Honours]], Ware was awarded the [[Companion Order of St Michael and St George]].{{Sfn|The Edinburgh Gazette 26 January 1917}} \n\n=== Imperial War Graves Commission ===\n[[File:Canadian Corps - Canadian war graves.jpg|thumb|Canadian war graves near [[Ypres, Belgium]].

Born in [[Clifton, Bristol]], he graduated from the [[University of Paris]] in 1894, and travelled to the [[Transvaal Colony]] where, as a member of [[Milner's Kindergarten]], he became Director of Education. Ware next became editor of the [[The Morning Post|''Morning Post'']], being fired in 1911 after several controversies.\n\nWhen the [[First World War]] started in August 1914, Ware attempted to join the [[British Army]] but was rejected because he was too old. With the assistance of [[Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner|Lord Milner]], he obtained command of a mobile [[ambulance]] unit provided by the [[British Red Cross Society]]. In this role he began marking and recording the graves of those killed. Ware and his graves' registration organization were transferred to the [[British Army]] in 1915. This was to become the Imperial War Graves Commission. Ware ended the war as a major general, having been [[mentioned in despatches]] twice and continued to work with the commission. In [[World War II]], he was appointed director-general of Graves Registration and Enquiries. He fully retired in 1948, and died the following year.\n==Early life==\nWare was born in [[Clifton, Bristol]] on 17 June 1869,<ref name=\"Veterans Agency\">{{cite web|url=http://www.veterans-uk.info/remembrance/ware.html|title=Major General Sir Fabian Ware|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[Veterans Agency|Ministry of Defence Veterans Agency]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112162637/http://www.veterans-uk.info/remembrance/ware.html|archive-date=12 November 2014|accessdate=7 November 2015}}</ref> to Charles Ware, a chartered accountant, and his wife, Amy Carew, {{Nee}} Goulstone.<ref name= \"ODNB\">{{cite ODNB|title=Ware, Sir Fabian Arthur Goulstone|id=3674|ref=harv|date=2008|first=A.

He became the representative of the Education Committee of the Royal British Commission at the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Exposition Universelle]] of 1900 in [[Paris]]. After the exhibition, Ware worked as an inspector of schools for the [[Board of education|Board of Education]].{{Sfn|Crane|2013|p=17}} He then became a member of a group of young Britons later known as [[Viscount Milner]]'s [[Milner's Kindergarten|kindergarten]]{{Sfn|Stamp|2010|p=72}} and in October 1901 was appointed assistant director of education in the [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]].{{Sfn|Worsfold|1913|p=79}} On 5 July 1902, [[Edmund Beale Sargant]], director of education for the Transvaal, wrote a letter to the [[Council of Education, Witwatersrand]], requesting their cooperation in selecting a committee regarding technical education. A committee was then formed, with Ware as the chairman. It recommended the establishment of a technical institute.{{Sfn|South African School of Mines and Technology|1910|pp=1\u20134}} In late 1902, the report on a technical institute  reached the [[Lieutenant Governor]] of the Transvaal who in January 1903 created a second \"Technical Education Commission\" again with Ware as a member.

The commission represented a joint effort between the British Army and British Red Cross.{{Efn|Crane writes that \"in some ways the GRC remained a curious hybrid, semi-detached sort of unit - the Red Cross continued to supply men and vehicles, while Ware was given the local rank of major... and the army took on the costs of crosses, rations and fuel\" {{Sfn|Crane|2013|p=52}}|name=|group=}}{{Sfn|Crane|2013|pp=50\u201352}} On 22 May, he was made a temporary [[major]] in the British Army.{{Sfn|The London Gazette 21 May 1915}} On 9 September, the promotion was [[antedated]] to 22 February 1915.{{Sfn|The London Gazette 7 September 1915}} \n\nWare's work continued to expand: by May 1915, 4,300 graves had been registered. He was extensively involved in early organization of the commission, dividing it into two main parts and seven sections. That spring he began serving as an intermediary between the French and British governments over grave-related matters. The organization began handling requests at a headquarters in [[Lillers]], and the sections worked on grave maintenance. The organization was soon exempted from a ban on [[War photography|photography]] and a department of three photographers was created to photograph graves; by mid-August, six thousand graves had been photographed and eight hundred photographs sent to families. A further 18,173 graves had been registered. Around the same time Ware became unable to continue work with the Mobile Ambulance Unit, and began to solely focus on the commission. On 6 September Macready recommended transferring the organization completely to the Army; the transfer was completed by late October.{{Sfn|Crane|2013|p=|pp=50\u201352, 54\u201356, 59}}  \n\nIn his role in the commission, wares served as \"the sole [[intermediary]] between the British Army in the Field and the French Military and Civil Authorities in all matters relating to graves.\"{{Sfn|War Graves|1929|p=15}} Throughout 1915 and 1916, Ware led negotiations between France and Britain, resolving various issues, particularly that of [[land expropriation]]. Around June 1915, his efforts resulted in an 'expropriation bill' that began to be debated by the French government. Ware shepherded the bill through its passage, urging prominent figures such as the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]], the [[Adjutant-General to the Forces|Adjutant-General]], the [[King of the United Kingdom|King]], and the editor of the ''Times'' to support it.{{Sfn|Crane|2013|p=|pp=59, 64}} The law passed the French government on 29 December 1917.{{Sfn|NYS Assembly|1918|p=548}} It gave Britain the ability to control their war graves in \"perpetuity of [[sepulture]]\"{{Sfn|Miles|2017|p=51}} and provided for the establishment of a British authority to manage the cemeteries.{{Sfn|Crane|2013|p=65}} \n\nWhen [[William Glynne Charles Gladstone]], a [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] and the grandson of former Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]], was [[killed in action]] near [[Laventie]] on 13 April 1915, his family attempted to have the body [[Exhumation|exhumed]] and returned to England. Despite a ban on exhumations established by [[Joseph Joffre]], his family received special permission to take the body and bury it in [[Hawarden|Hawarden, Wales]].

For example, [[Lionel Earle]], a member of the International War Graves Committee, objected to the Army's practice of marking the graves of [[deserters]] with unmarked wooden crosses. As a result the custom was abolished. In 1916, efforts to neaten the cemeteries began.

He has the most difficult 18 descents to his credit. In mountains people are usually known for first ascent of high and difficult peaks but he is famous for first descents [[:fr:Sylvain Saudan|(see French Wikipedia)]]. In 1969 he skied [[Monte Rosa]], and [[Mount Hood]] in 1971. In 1970 he skied the W flank of the [[Eiger]]. He has climbed then skied back down the SW face of [[Denali]] (Mount McKinley), Alaska, the highest mountain in North America, in 1972; [[Mont Blanc]] in 1968, the highest mountain in the Alps; [[Kilimanjaro]], the highest mountain in Africa; [[Nun Kun|Nun]] peak in the [[Himalayas]] in 1976; and a number of other peaks in [[Nepal]] and the [[Karakoram]]. On his 50th birthday he skied down Japan's [[Mount Fuji]], without snow, on [[scree]]. Saudan's crowning achievement came in 1982 when, at age 46, he skied down Pakistan's {{convert|26470|ft|m|adj=on}}-high [[Gasherbrum I]], or Hidden Peak, in the [[Himalayas]]. It was, and possibly still is, the longest 50-degree ski descent ever accomplished and likely the first full descent of an '8,000 meter' mountain.\n\nIn order to safely ski these mountains he developed a new technique to \"jump turn\" on very steep inclines. Normal jump turns would have accelerated the skier and thrown him too far down the mountain so, using long ski poles, Saudan turned by planting a ski pole downhill and, keeping his weight on both skis and leaning back on his heels, he lifted the ski tips up and swivelled them in an arc into the turn. These turns, rhythmically swivelling the skis in arcs left and right, he christened the ''windscreen wiper'' turns.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/ski/interviews/graham-bell-interview-sylvain-saudan-skier-impossible/|title=Meet Sylvain Saudan, skier of the impossible|website=The Telegraph online}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/25/magazine/skiing-the-steeps.html|title=SKIING THE STEEPS|website=The New York Times online}}</ref>\n\nHe is an accomplished guide for [[heliskiing]], one of the first European guides, along with [[Hans Gmoser]], to exploit [[the Bugaboos]] in [[British Columbia]] in the 1970s, with waist deep powder snow (often 150,000 vertical feet per week or more).

Prior to the commencement of the season it was stated in the management committee meeting that 487 players in the Auckland district alone had committed to the war effort\n.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Big Entry of Teams\n| page =7\n| publisher =Auckland Star, Volume XLVII, Issue 107\n| date = 1916-05-04\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19160505.2.101\n| accessdate = 2019-12-09}}</ref> Teams were filled with older players and juniors. The [[Otahuhu Leopards|Otahuhu]] senior team as was noted at their committee meeting featured \u201conly three men eligible for military service..., and these were all registered and waiting to be called up. Of the remainder, six were married men with families, two were permanent force men, and four were under military age\u201d.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Otahuhu Club\n| page = 4\n| work = New Zealand Herald |volume=LIII |issue=16225\n| date = 1916-05-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19160510.2.9.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-14}}</ref> \n\nDespite this attendances were still good, with the mid season match between [[City Rovers]] and [[Grafton Athletic]] at [[Victoria Park, Auckland|Victoria Park]] attracting 3,000 spectators. While the Round 7 fixtures at [[Victoria Park, Auckland|Victoria Park]] drew the same number of spectators and 4,000 attending the round 8 matches.

It stated that the playing ranks had been severely depleted over the past season as over 600 players had joined the ranks of the military to fight in the first world war. There were 42 teams in total to compete across six grades (7 in the senior grade, 5 in second grade, 9 in third grade, 7 in the fourth grade, 8 in the fifth grade, and 6 in the sixth grade). Fourteen clubs were affiliated to the Auckland Rugby League with over 800 players in total. The Mangere, Remuera, and [[Northcote Tigers|Northcote]] clubs withdrew from the competition due to so many of their players going to war.\n\nSignificantly they secured the option of the Chinamen's gardens just off Stanley Street and this was to later be turned into [[Carlaw Park]].<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Auckland Rugby League/Past Season Reviewed\n| page =8\n| work = New Zealand Herald |volume=LIV |issue=16526\n| date = 1917-04-30\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19170430.2.71.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-14}}</ref>\n\nIt was suggested that the newly-formed Garrison Artillery Club enter a first grade team however as there were already 6 teams competing there was a fear that it would weaken the existing teams. [[Otahuhu Leopards|Otahuhu]] asked for [[Auckland Rugby League]] to request a special Saturday afternoon \u201ctrain to be run to bring players, spectators and the general public to [[Otahuhu]] or Saturday afternoons\u201d during the season.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Arrangements for Saturday\n| page =4\n| work = New Zealand Herald |volume=LIII\n| date = 1916-05-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19160510.2.9.1| accessdate = 2019-08-14}}</ref>\n\n{{s-start}}\n        {{s-bef|before=[[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|1915]]}}\n        {{s-ttl|title=8th [[Auckland Rugby League]] season\n        |years=1916}}\n        {{s-aft|after=[[1917 Auckland Rugby League season|1917]]}}\n        {{end}}\n\n==First Grade Championship==\nThirty matches were played during the season with the 20 being played at [[Victoria Park, Auckland|Victoria Park]].

It stated that the playing ranks had been severely depleted over the past season as over 600 players had joined the ranks of the military to fight in the first world war. There were 42 teams in total to compete across six grades (7 in the senior grade, 5 in second grade, 9 in third grade, 7 in the fourth grade, 8 in the fifth grade, and 6 in the sixth grade).
