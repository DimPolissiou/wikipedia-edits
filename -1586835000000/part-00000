Like all the other Arkansas regiments raised in the first wave of recruiting in 1861, they were taken into Confederate armies east of the Mississippi River, and only the few survivors made it back home after the war.  The 9th was present, across the river at Columbus Kentucky during the Battle of Belmont, Missouri and was subsequently retained at Bowling Green, Kentucky, for the defense of that post during the winter of 1861-1862. The regiment was assigned to General Bowen's Brigade, consisting of the 9th and [[10th Arkansas Infantry Regiment|10th Arkansas]], 5th Missouri and 10th Mississippi Infantry Regiments before they were moved to Kentucky.<ref name=\"Confederate Military History\">Harrell, Col.

After the losses of [[Fort Henry (site of the Battle of Fort Henry)|Fort Henry]] and [[Fort Donelson]] in February 1862, Confederate General [[Albert Sidney Johnston]] withdrew his forces into western Tennessee, northern Mississippi, and Alabama to reorganize. and then retreated through western Tennessee to Corinth, Mississippi. On March 29, 1862, the [[Army of Central Kentucky]] was merged into the [[Army of Mississippi]] in preparation for the Battle of Shiloh. Bowen's Brigade, including the 9th and 10th Arkansas Infantry Regiments, was then placed in General Brigadier General [[John C. Breckinridge]]'s Reserve Corps as part of the [[Army of Mississippi]]. It fought gallantly at Shiloh, charging repeatedly upon the \"Hornet's Nest\" where it lost Lieutenant Colonel Dunlop. It was through this regiment that General [[Albert Sidney Johnston]] rode from the rear to the front, with a tin cup he had appropriated earlier that morning, saying \"Men of Arkansas, the enemy is stubborn. I want you to show General Beauregard and General Bragg what you can do with your bayonets and toothpicks!\" The regiment went forward with a cheer and passed him at a run; in five minutes 130 men of their ranks were killed or wounded, but they did not falter. Lieutenant Duckworth was killed at the head of his company, and Captain Wallace was wounded. It closed up and disappeared into the thicket in front, followed by the whole Confederate line, and the enemy was silenced in twenty minutes. General Johnston, however, received a mortal wound while leading this charge, and shortly thereafter bled to death.

The 9th served in Brigadier General [[Abraham Buford]]'s brigade of Major General [[William W. Loring]]'s division of Lieutenant General [[John C.

Johnston had been gathering troops at Jackson, intending to relieve pressure on Lt. Gen. [[John C. Pemberton]]'s beleaguered garrison.

After the losses of [[Fort Henry (site of the Battle of Fort Henry)|Fort Henry]] and [[Fort Donelson]] in February 1862, Confederate General [[Albert Sidney Johnston]] withdrew his forces into western Tennessee, northern Mississippi, and Alabama to reorganize. and then retreated through western Tennessee to Corinth, Mississippi. On March 29, 1862, the [[Army of Central Kentucky]] was merged into the [[Army of Mississippi]] in preparation for the Battle of Shiloh. Bowen's Brigade, including the 9th and 10th Arkansas Infantry Regiments, was then placed in General Brigadier General [[John C. Breckinridge]]'s Reserve Corps as part of the [[Army of Mississippi]]. It fought gallantly at Shiloh, charging repeatedly upon the \"Hornet's Nest\" where it lost Lieutenant Colonel Dunlop. It was through this regiment that General [[Albert Sidney Johnston]] rode from the rear to the front, with a tin cup he had appropriated earlier that morning, saying \"Men of Arkansas, the enemy is stubborn. I want you to show General Beauregard and General Bragg what you can do with your bayonets and toothpicks!\" The regiment went forward with a cheer and passed him at a run; in five minutes 130 men of their ranks were killed or wounded, but they did not falter. Lieutenant Duckworth was killed at the head of his company, and Captain Wallace was wounded. It closed up and disappeared into the thicket in front, followed by the whole Confederate line, and the enemy was silenced in twenty minutes.

The flag is a second Confederate national flag pattern. According to its history, it was preserved by Color Bearer Degan Foley and given to Rev. J.M. Lucey of Pine Bluff, who donated it to the museum in 1896.\n\nThe [[Old State House]] at [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]] also contains a flag previously attributed to the Ninth. A variation of the first national flag with twelve stars, nine describing a circle and three within it. More recent research now indicates that this flag most likely belonged to the [[11th Arkansas Infantry Regiment]] and was found, along with the regiment's baggage in Fort Thompson after the unit evacuated [[Battle of Island No. 10|Island No. 10]]. The flag was returned to Arkansas by the State of Michigan in 1941.
