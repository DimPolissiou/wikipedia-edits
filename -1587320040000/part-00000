The formation may also have some potential for biogenic [[natural gas]].<ref name=Macauley>Macauley, G. 1984. Cretaceous oil shale potential in Saskatchewan. In: J.A.

The game was held on July 8, 1941, at [[Briggs Stadium]] in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], the home of the [[Detroit Tigers]] of the American League.\n\n==Result==\nThe American League defeated the National League, 7\u20135. With the NL leading 5\u20134, two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning, and [[Joe Gordon]] and [[Joe DiMaggio]] of the [[New York Yankees]] on base; [[Ted Williams]] of the [[Boston Red Sox]] hit a [[walk-off home run]] off of [[Claude Passeau]] of the [[Chicago Cubs]] to win it for the AL.<ref name=retro/>\n\nPrior to Williams' at-bat DiMaggio hit a potential game-ending double play groundball. However, [[Billy Herman]]\u2019s relay throw pulled first baseman [[Frank McCormick]] off the bag, thus extending the game and setting up William\u2019s at-bat.\n\nIn the end, the AL\u2019s dramatic 7-to-4 walk-off win overshadowed two home runs hit by Pittsburgh Pirates shortstop [[Arky Vaughan]], which had given the NL 3-to-2 and 5-to-2 leads in the seventh and eighth innings, respectively.\n\n\n[[File:Ted_Williams_&_Joe_DiMaggio_1941_MLB_All-Star_Game.jpg|thumb|center|[[Ted Williams]] (left) and [[Joe DiMaggio]] after the game]]\n\n==Summary==\n\nThe game began as a pitcher\u2019s duel between [[Bob Feller]] (Cleveland, AL) and [[Whit Wyatt]] (Brooklyn, NL), who pitched three and two scoreless innings, respectively. It wasn\u2019t until the fourth inning that either team put a runner in scoring position, when doubles by [[Cecil Travis]] (Washington) and [[Ted Williams]] off the second NL hurler, [[Paul Derringer]] (Cincinnati), put the AL ahead 1-0.\n\nIn the sixth inning the NL used a lead-off double by [[Bucky Waters]] (Cincinnati) to tie the game at 1-1 with the help of two sacrifices: a bunt by [[Stan Hack]] (Chicago Cubs) to move Waters to third and a sacrifice fly by [[Terry Moore]] (St. Louis Cardinals) to allow him to score.\n\nHowever, the AL quickly answered in the bottom half of the same inning when Cleveland shortstop [[Lou Boudreau]] (who had entered the game for [[Joe Cronin]]) singled home [[Joe DiMaggio]], who was one of two American Leaguers to reach base via a walk that frame, for a 2-to-1 AL lead.\n\nThe top halves of the seventh and eighth innings saw the heroics of [[Arky Vaughan]], who hit a two-run home run in each to also score two St. Louis Cardinals players: [[Enos Slaughter]], who had opened the seventh inning with a single, and [[Johnny Mize]], who had preceded Vaughan\u2019s round-tripper in the eighth with a one-out double.\n\nWith the score now 5-2 in favor of the National League the first pair of brothers to ever appear together in an All-Star Game cut into the NL lead, when [[Dominic DiMaggio]] - in his first plate appearance of the game - singled home Joe after his one-out double.<ref>http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/history/all_star_event.jsp?story=15</ref>\n\nIn the ninth inning, White Sox hurler [[Eddie Smith]], who had given up one of Vaughan\u2019s home runs, retired the NL in order in his second inning of work. One of the three NL hitters to step to the plate that half-inning was pitcher [[Claude Passeau]], who - with his team trailing 5-3 - was not pulled for a pinch hitter, and thus returned to the mound in the bottom of the ninth for his third inning of work.\n\nWith one out in the bottom of the ninth, three consecutive AL batters reached base, putting the tying and go-ahead runs on base and bringing [[Joe DiMaggio]] to the plate. The \u201cYankee Clipper\u201d then hit what some sources describe as a routine double-play groundball, which would have ended the ballgame. However, the relay throw from second to first by [[Billy Herman]] pulled first baseman [[Frank McCormick]] off the bag and extended the game.\n\nWith the NL still leading 5-4 (a run had scored on DiMaggio\u2019s groundout), the AL now had the tying run on third and the winning run on first. Not electing to walk [[Ted Williams]], which would have advanced the winning run to second base and brought [[Dominic DiMaggio]] to the plate, NL manager [[Bill McKechnie]], let [[Claude Passeau]] pitch to [[Ted Williams]]. With the count two balls and one strike Williams hit a three-run home run off the third deck of the right field stands of Detroit\u2019s [[Briggs Stadium]] for a 7-to-5 American League victory.\n\n==Context & Aftermath==\n\nThe 1941 All Star Game took place in the midst of [[Joe DiMaggio]]\u2019s astounding 56-game hitting streak (but did not count towards it, since the All Star Game is considered an exhibition game). DiMaggio had equaled the all-time record of 44 games, set by [[Willie Keeler]] in 1897, seven days prior to the All Star Game and broken it the day after that (July 1 and 2, respectively). <ref>https://www.baseball-almanac.com/feats/feats3.shtml</ref> The streak would end nine days after the All Star Game, when DiMaggio went hitless on July 17 against the Cleveland Indians.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/14/sports/ken-keltner-75-indians-infielder-who-helped-end-dimaggio-streak.html</ref>\n\n[[Ted Williams]], whose batting average was at .405 at the time of the All Star Game, would even slightly top that hitting pace for the rest of the season and end the 1941 campaign at .406, making him the last hitter to reach the .400 mark for a season.<ref>https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/gl.fcgi?id=willite01&t=b&year=1941</ref>\n\nThe 1941 baseball season, of which the All Star Game marked the halfway point, took place right before the United States would enter World War II. The juxtaposition of that memorable season taking place with the war looming is illustrated in the book Baseball in \u201941 by renowned sportswriter [[Robert Creamer]].<ref>https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/robert-w-creamer/baseball-in-41/</ref> Although the Major League season and the World Series would continue to be played during the war years, the All Star Game was cancelled in 1945 due to war-time travel restrictions.\n\nThe fact that [[Arky Vaughan]] was eventually denied the accolades of being the player of the game despite his two home runs can be seen as symbolic of his entire career: Despite arguably being the preeminent offensive shortstop of his time, hitting .300 or higher in 12 of his 14 Major League seasons,<ref>https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/v/vaughar01.shtml</ref> Vaughan wasn\u2019t inducted into the Hall of Fame until 1985 (posthumously, by the Veterans Committee, nearly four decades after his last major league appearance) and is not remembered as vividly as many of the other stars of this era.<ref>https://sabr.org/bioproj/person/4e00be9b</ref>\n\n\n==Rosters==\nPlayers in ''italics'' have since been inducted into the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame]].\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===National League===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 100%;

The game was held on July 8, 1941, at [[Briggs Stadium]] in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], the home of the [[Detroit Tigers]] of the American League.\n\n==Result==\nThe American League defeated the National League, 7\u20135. With the NL leading 5\u20134, two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning, and [[Joe Gordon]] and [[Joe DiMaggio]] of the [[New York Yankees]] on base; [[Ted Williams]] of the [[Boston Red Sox]] hit a [[walk-off home run]] off of [[Claude Passeau]] of the [[Chicago Cubs]] to win it for the AL.<ref name=retro/>\n\nPrior to Williams' at-bat DiMaggio hit a potential game-ending double play groundball. However, [[Billy Herman]]\u2019s relay throw pulled first baseman [[Frank McCormick]] off the bag, thus extending the game and setting up William\u2019s at-bat.\n\nIn the end, the AL\u2019s dramatic 7-to-4 walk-off win overshadowed two home runs hit by Pittsburgh Pirates shortstop [[Arky Vaughan]], which had given the NL 3-to-2 and 5-to-2 leads in the seventh and eighth innings, respectively.\n\n\n[[File:Ted_Williams_&_Joe_DiMaggio_1941_MLB_All-Star_Game.jpg|thumb|center|[[Ted Williams]] (left) and [[Joe DiMaggio]] after the game]]\n\n==Summary==\n\nThe game began as a pitcher\u2019s duel between [[Bob Feller]] (Cleveland, AL) and [[Whit Wyatt]] (Brooklyn, NL), who pitched three and two scoreless innings, respectively. It wasn\u2019t until the fourth inning that either team put a runner in scoring position, when doubles by [[Cecil Travis]] (Washington) and [[Ted Williams]] off the second NL hurler, [[Paul Derringer]] (Cincinnati), put the AL ahead 1-0.\n\nIn the sixth inning the NL used a lead-off double by [[Bucky Waters]] (Cincinnati) to tie the game at 1-1 with the help of two sacrifices: a bunt by [[Stan Hack]] (Chicago Cubs) to move Waters to third and a sacrifice fly by [[Terry Moore]] (St. Louis Cardinals) to allow him to score.\n\nHowever, the AL quickly answered in the bottom half of the same inning when Cleveland shortstop [[Lou Boudreau]] (who had entered the game for [[Joe Cronin]]) singled home [[Joe DiMaggio]], who was one of two American Leaguers to reach base via a walk that frame, for a 2-to-1 AL lead.\n\nThe top halves of the seventh and eighth innings saw the heroics of [[Arky Vaughan]], who hit a two-run home run in each to also score two St. Louis Cardinals players: [[Enos Slaughter]], who had opened the seventh inning with a single, and [[Johnny Mize]], who had preceded Vaughan\u2019s round-tripper in the eighth with a one-out double.\n\nWith the score now 5-2 in favor of the National League the first pair of brothers to ever appear together in an All-Star Game cut into the NL lead, when [[Dominic DiMaggio]] - in his first plate appearance of the game - singled home Joe after his one-out double.<ref>http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/history/all_star_event.jsp?story=15</ref>\n\nIn the ninth inning, White Sox hurler [[Eddie Smith]], who had given up one of Vaughan\u2019s home runs, retired the NL in order in his second inning of work. One of the three NL hitters to step to the plate that half-inning was pitcher [[Claude Passeau]], who - with his team trailing 5-3 - was not pulled for a pinch hitter, and thus returned to the mound in the bottom of the ninth for his third inning of work.\n\nWith one out in the bottom of the ninth, three consecutive AL batters reached base, putting the tying and go-ahead runs on base and bringing [[Joe DiMaggio]] to the plate. The \u201cYankee Clipper\u201d then hit what some sources describe as a routine double-play groundball, which would have ended the ballgame. However, the relay throw from second to first by [[Billy Herman]] pulled first baseman [[Frank McCormick]] off the bag and extended the game.\n\nWith the NL still leading 5-4 (a run had scored on DiMaggio\u2019s groundout), the AL now had the tying run on third and the winning run on first. Not electing to walk [[Ted Williams]], which would have advanced the winning run to second base and brought [[Dominic DiMaggio]] to the plate, NL manager [[Bill McKechnie]], let [[Claude Passeau]] pitch to [[Ted Williams]]. With the count two balls and one strike Williams hit a three-run homerun off the third deck of the right field stands of Detroit\u2019s [[Briggs Stadium]] for a 7-to-5 American League victory.\n\n\n==Context & Aftermath==\n\nThe 1941 All Star Game took place in the midst of [[Joe DiMaggio]]\u2019s astounding 56-game hitting streak (but did not count towards it, since the All Star Game is considered an exhibition game). DiMaggio had equaled the all-time record of 44 games, set by [[Willie Keeler]] in 1897, seven days prior to the All Star Game and broken it the day after that (July 1 and 2, respectively). <ref>https://www.baseball-almanac.com/feats/feats3.shtml</ref> The streak would end nine days after the All Star Game, when DiMaggio went hitless on July 17 against the Cleveland Indians.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/14/sports/ken-keltner-75-indians-infielder-who-helped-end-dimaggio-streak.html</ref>\n\n[[Ted Williams]], whose batting average was at .405 at the time of the All Star Game, would even slightly top that hitting pace for the rest of the season and end the 1941 campaign at .406, making him the last hitter to reach the .400 mark for a season.<ref>https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/gl.fcgi?id=willite01&t=b&year=1941</ref>\n\nThe 1941 baseball season, of which the All Star Game marked the halfway point, took place right before the United States would enter World War II. The juxtaposition of that memorable season taking place with the war looming is illustrated in the book Baseball in \u201941 by renowned sportswriter [[Robert Creamer]].<ref>https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/robert-w-creamer/baseball-in-41/</ref> Although the Major League season and the World Series would continue to be played during the war years, the All Star Game was cancelled in 1945 due to war-time travel restrictions.\n\nThe fact that [[Arky Vaughan]] was eventually denied the accolades of being the player of the game despite his two home runs can be seen as symbolic of his entire career: Despite arguably being the preeminent offensive shortstop of his time, hitting .300 or higher in 12 of his 14 Major League seasons,<ref>https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/v/vaughar01.shtml</ref> Vaughan wasn\u2019t inducted into the Hall of Fame until 1985 (posthumously, by the Veterans Committee, nearly four decades after his last major league appearance) and is not remembered as vividly as many of the other stars of this era.<ref>https://sabr.org/bioproj/person/4e00be9b</ref>\n\n\n==Rosters==\nPlayers in ''italics'' have since been inducted into the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame]].\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===National League===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 100%;
