He was the fifth king of the [[House of Plantagenet]]. Before his accession to the throne, he was commonly referred to as '''The Lord Edward'''.{{sfnm|1a1=Burt|1y=2013|1p=75|2a1=Carpenter|2y=1985|3a1=Lloyd|3y=1986|4a1=Powicke|4y=1947}} The first son of [[Henry III of England|Henry&nbsp;III]], Edward was involved from an early age in the political intrigues of his father's reign, which included an outright rebellion by the English [[baron]]s. In 1259, he briefly sided with a baronial reform movement, supporting the [[Provisions of Oxford]]. After reconciliation with his father, however, he remained loyal throughout the subsequent armed conflict, known as the [[Second Barons' War]]. After the [[Battle of Lewes]], Edward was hostage to the rebellious barons, but escaped after a few months and defeated the baronial leader [[Simon de Montfort]] at the [[Battle of Evesham]] in 1265. Within two years the rebellion was extinguished and, with England pacified, Edward joined the [[Ninth Crusade]] to the [[Holy Land]]. He was on his way home in 1272 when he was informed that his father had died. Making a slow return, he reached England in 1274 and was crowned at [[Westminster Abbey]].\n\nEdward spent much of his reign reforming royal administration and [[common law]]. Through an extensive legal inquiry, he investigated the tenure of various [[feudal]] liberties, while the law was reformed through a series of [[statute]]s regulating criminal and property law. Increasingly, however, Edward's attention was drawn towards military affairs. After suppressing a minor rebellion in Wales in 1276\u201377, Edward responded to a second rebellion in 1282\u201383 with [[Conquest of Wales by Edward I|a full-scale war of conquest]]. After a successful campaign, he subjected Wales to English rule, built a series of castles and towns in the countryside and settled them with [[English people]]. Next, his efforts were directed towards the [[Kingdom of Scotland]]. Initially invited to arbitrate [[Competitors for the Crown of Scotland|a succession dispute]], Edward claimed feudal [[suzerainty]] over Scotland. [[First Scottish War of Independence|The war]] that followed continued after Edward's death, even though the English seemed victorious at several points. Simultaneously, Edward found himself at [[Anglo-French War (1294\u20131303)|war with France]] (a [[Auld Alliance|Scottish ally]]) after King [[Philip IV of France]] had confiscated the [[Duchy of Gascony]], which until then had been held in [[personal union]] with the [[Kingdom of England]]. Although Edward recovered his duchy, this conflict relieved English military pressure against Scotland. At the same time there were problems at home. In the mid-1290s, extensive military campaigns required high levels of [[tax]]ation, and Edward met with both [[Laity|lay]] and ecclesiastical opposition. These crises were initially averted, but issues remained unsettled. When the King died in 1307, he left to his son [[Edward&nbsp;II]] an ongoing war with Scotland and many financial and political problems.\n\nEdward I was a tall man (6'2\") for his era, hence the nickname \"Longshanks\". He was temperamental, and this, along with his height, made him an intimidating man, and he often instilled fear in his contemporaries. Nevertheless, he held the respect of his subjects for the way he embodied the medieval ideal of kingship, as a soldier, an administrator and a man of faith. Modern historians are divided on their assessment of Edward: while some have praised him for his contribution to the law and administration, others have criticised him for his uncompromising attitude towards his nobility. Currently, Edward&nbsp;I is credited with many accomplishments during his reign, including restoring royal authority after the reign of Henry&nbsp;III, establishing [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] as a permanent institution and thereby also a functional system for raising taxes, and reforming the law through statutes. At the same time, he is also often criticised for other actions, such as his brutal conduct towards the Welsh and Scots, and issuing the [[Edict of Expulsion]] in 1290, by which the Jews were expelled from England. The Edict remained in effect for the rest of the [[Middle Ages]], and it was over 350 years until it was formally overturned under [[Oliver Cromwell]] in 1657.\n\n==Early years, 1239\u201363==\n\n===Childhood and marriage===\n[[File:Edward I and Eleanor.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Inside an initial letter are drawn two heads with necks, a male over a female.

He had already received Gascony as early as 1249, but [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester]], had been appointed as royal lieutenant the year before and, consequently, drew its income, so in practice Edward derived neither authority nor revenue from this province.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=7\u20138}}</ref> The grant he received in 1254 included most of Ireland, and much land in Wales and England, including the [[earldom of Chester]], but King Henry retained much control over the land in question, particularly in Ireland, so Edward's power was limited there as well, and the King derived most of the income from those lands.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=11\u201314}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1254 to 1257, Edward was under the influence of his mother's relatives, known as the Savoyards,<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|2007 |p=96}}</ref> the most notable of whom was [[Peter II of Savoy]], the Queen's uncle.<ref>{{Harvnb|Morris|2009|p=7}}</ref> After 1257, Edward increasingly fell in with the Poitevin or [[Lusignan]] faction&nbsp;\u2013 the half-brothers of his father Henry&nbsp;III&nbsp;\u2013 led by such men as [[William de Valence]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=22\u201323}}</ref>{{efn|Henry&nbsp;III's mother [[Isabella of Angoul\u00eame]] married [[Hugh X of Lusignan]] after the death of King [[John of England]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=21}}</ref>}} This association was significant, because the two groups of privileged foreigners were resented by the established English aristocracy, and they would be at the centre of the ensuing years' baronial reform movement.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|2007|p=95}}</ref> There were tales of unruly and violent conduct by Edward and his Lusignan kinsmen, which raised questions about Edward's personal qualities.

This ran contrary to his father's policy of mediation between the local factions.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=15\u201316}}</ref> In May 1258, a group of [[magnate]]s drew up a document for reform of the King's government&nbsp;\u2013 the so-called [[Provisions of Oxford]]&nbsp;\u2013 largely directed against the Lusignans. Edward stood by his political allies and strongly opposed the Provisions. The reform movement succeeded in limiting the Lusignan influence, however, and gradually Edward's attitude started to change. In March 1259, he entered into a formal alliance with one of the main reformers, [[Richard de Clare, 6th Earl of Gloucester]]. Then, on 15&nbsp;October 1259, he announced that he supported the barons' goals, and their leader, Simon de Montfort.<ref>{{Harvnb|Carpenter|1985}}</ref>\n\nThe motive behind Edward's change of heart could have been purely pragmatic; Montfort was in a good position to support his cause in Gascony.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=31\u201332}}</ref> When the King left for France in November, Edward's behaviour turned into pure insubordination. He made several appointments to advance the cause of the reformers, causing his father to believe that Edward was considering a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=32\u201333}}</ref> When the King returned from France, he initially refused to see his son, but through the mediation of the Earl of Cornwall and [[Boniface, Archbishop of Canterbury]], the two were eventually reconciled.<ref>{{Harvnb|Morris|2009|pp=44\u201345}}</ref> Edward was sent abroad, and in November 1260 he again united with the Lusignans, who had been exiled to France.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=34}}</ref>\n\nBack in England, early in 1262, Edward fell out with some of his former Lusignan allies over financial matters. The next year, King Henry sent him on a campaign in Wales against [[Llywelyn ap Gruffudd]], with only limited results.<ref>{{Harvnb|Powicke|1962|pp=171\u2013172}}</ref> Around the same time, Montfort, who had been out of the country since 1261, returned to England and reignited the baronial reform movement.<ref>{{Harvnb|Maddicott|1994|p=225}}</ref> It was at this pivotal moment, as the King seemed ready to resign to the barons' demands, that Edward began to take control of the situation. Whereas he had so far been unpredictable and equivocating, from this point on he remained firmly devoted to protecting his father's royal rights.<ref>{{Harvnb|Powicke|1962|pp=178}}</ref> He reunited with some of the men he had alienated the year before&nbsp;\u2013 among them his childhood friend, Henry of Almain, and [[John de Warenne, 6th Earl of Surrey]]&nbsp;\u2013 and retook [[Windsor Castle]] from the rebels.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=41}}</ref> Through the arbitration of King [[Louis&nbsp;IX of France]], an agreement was made between the two parties. This so-called [[Mise of Amiens]] was largely favourable to the royalist side, and laid the seeds for further conflict.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|2007|p=113}}</ref>\n\n==Civil war and crusades, 1264\u201373==\n\n===Second Barons' War===\n{{main|Second Barons' War}}\n\nThe years 1264\u20131267 saw the conflict known as the [[Second Barons' War]], in which baronial forces led by Simon de Montfort fought against those who remained loyal to the King. The first scene of battle was the city of [[Gloucester]], which Edward managed to retake from the enemy. When [[Robert de Ferrers, 6th Earl of Derby]], came to the assistance of the rebels, Edward negotiated a truce with the Earl, the terms of which Edward later broke. He then captured [[Northampton]] from [[Simon de Montfort the Younger]] before embarking on a retaliatory campaign against Derby's lands.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=42\u201343}}</ref> The baronial and royalist forces finally met at the [[Battle of Lewes]], on 14&nbsp;May 1264. Edward, commanding the right wing, performed well, and soon defeated the London contingent of Montfort's forces. Unwisely, however, he followed the scattered enemy in pursuit, and on his return found the rest of the royal army defeated.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sadler|2008|pp=55\u201369}}</ref> By the agreement known as the [[Mise of Lewes]], Edward and his cousin Henry of Almain were given up as hostages to Montfort.<ref>{{Harvnb|Maddicott|1983|pp=592\u2013599}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Montfort Evesham.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.35|alt=There are three sections.

As [[Duke of Aquitaine]], Edward was a [[vassal]] of the French king.]]\nEdward never again went on crusade after his return to England in 1274, but he maintained an intention to do so, and took the cross again in 1287.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=326\u2013328}}</ref> This intention guided much of his foreign policy, until at least 1291. To stage a European-wide crusade, it was essential to prevent conflict between the greater princes on the continent. A major obstacle to this was represented by the conflict between the French [[Capetian House of Anjou]] ruling southern Italy, and the [[Kingdom of Aragon]] in Spain. In 1282, the citizens of Palermo rose up against Charles of Anjou and turned for help to [[Peter III of Aragon]], in what has become known as the [[Sicilian Vespers]]. In the war that followed, Charles of Anjou's son, [[Charles of Salerno]], was taken prisoner by the Aragonese.<ref>{{Harvnb|Powicke|1962|pp=252\u2013253}}</ref> The French began planning an attack on Aragon, raising the prospect of a large-scale European war. To Edward, it was imperative that such a war be avoided, and in Paris in 1286 he brokered a truce between France and Aragon that helped secure Charles' release.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=323\u2013325}}</ref> As far as the crusades were concerned, however, Edward's efforts proved ineffective. A devastating blow to his plans came in 1291, when the Mamluks [[Siege of Acre (1291)|captured Acre]], the last Christian stronghold in the Holy Land.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=329}}</ref>\n\nAfter the fall of Acre, Edward's international role changed from that of a diplomat to an antagonist. He had long been deeply involved in the affairs of his own [[Duchy of Gascony]]. In 1278 he assigned an investigating commission to his trusted associates [[Otto de Grandson]] and the chancellor [[Robert Burnell]], which caused the replacement of the seneschal [[Luke de Tany]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=304}}</ref> In 1286, Edward visited the region himself and stayed for almost three years.<ref>{{Harvnb|Morris|2009|pp=204\u2013217}}</ref> The perennial problem, however, was the status of Gascony within the kingdom of France, and Edward's role as the French king's vassal. On his diplomatic mission in 1286, Edward had paid homage to the new king, [[Philip IV of France|Philip IV]], but in 1294 Philip declared Gascony forfeit when Edward refused to appear before him in Paris to discuss the recent conflict between English, Gascon, and French sailors that had resulted in several French ships being captured, along with the sacking of the French port of [[La Rochelle]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Morris|2009|pp=265\u2013270}}</ref>\n\nEleanor of Castile had died on 28&nbsp;November 1290. Uncommon for such marriages of the period, the couple loved each other.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} Moreover, like his father, Edward was very devoted to his wife and was faithful to her throughout their married lives&nbsp;\u2014 a rarity among monarchs of the time. He was deeply affected by her death. He displayed his grief by erecting twelve so-called [[Eleanor cross]]es, one at each place where her funeral cort\u00e8ge stopped for the night.<ref>{{Harvnb|Morris|2009|pp=230\u2013231}}</ref> As part of the peace accord between England and France in 1294, it was agreed that Edward should marry Philip IV's half-sister [[Margaret of France, Queen of England|Margaret]], but the marriage was delayed by the outbreak of war.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=395\u2013396}}</ref>\n\nEdward made alliances with the German king, the Counts of Flanders and Guelders, and the Burgundians, who would attack France from the north.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=387\u2013390}}</ref> However, the alliances proved volatile and Edward was facing trouble at home at the time, both in Wales and Scotland. It was not until August 1297 that he was finally able to sail for Flanders, at which time his allies there had already suffered defeat.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=392}}</ref> The support from Germany never materialised, and Edward was forced to seek peace.

Now he insisted that, if he were to settle the contest, he had to be fully recognised as Scotland's feudal overlord.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=361\u2013363}}</ref> The Scots were reluctant to make such a concession, and replied that since the country had no king, no one had the authority to make this decision.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barrow|1965|p=45}}</ref> This problem was circumvented when the competitors agreed that the realm would be handed over to Edward until a rightful heir had been found.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=365}}</ref> After a lengthy hearing, a decision was made in favour of John Balliol on 17&nbsp;November 1292.<ref name=Prestwich1997PP358/>{{efn|Even though the principle of [[primogeniture]] did not necessarily apply to descent through female heirs, there is little doubt that Balliol's claim was the strongest one.<ref name=Prestwich1997PP358>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=358, 367}}</ref>}}\n\nEven after Balliol's accession, Edward still continued to assert his authority over Scotland.

The initial resistance was not caused by the lay taxes, however, but by clerical subsidies. In 1294, Edward made a demand of a grant of one half of all clerical revenues. There was some resistance, but the King responded by threatening with [[outlaw]]ry, and the grant was eventually made.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=403\u2013404}}</ref> At the time, the [[Archbishop of Canterbury|archbishopric of Canterbury]] was vacant, since [[Robert Winchelsey]] was in Italy to receive consecration.<ref name=Powicke1962P671/>{{efn|Winchelsey's consecration was held up by the protracted [[1292\u20131294 papal election]].<ref name=Powicke1962P671>{{Harvnb|Powicke|1962|p=671}}</ref>}} Winchelsey returned in January 1295 and had to consent to another grant in November of that year.

This resistance focused on two things: the King's right to demand military service, and his right to levy taxes. At the Salisbury parliament of February 1297, [[Earl Marshal]] [[Roger Bigod, 5th Earl of Norfolk]], objected to a royal summons of military service. Bigod argued that the military obligation only extended to service alongside the King; if the King intended to sail to Flanders, he could not send his subjects to Gascony.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1972|p=251}}</ref> In July, Bigod and [[Humphrey de Bohun, 3rd Earl of Hereford]] and [[Constable of England]], drew up a series of complaints known as the [[Remonstrances]], in which objections to the extortionate level of taxation were voiced.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harriss|1975|p=61}}.</ref> Undeterred, Edward requested another lay subsidy.

He was the fifth king of the [[House of Plantagenet]]. Before his accession to the throne, he was commonly referred to as '''The Lord Edward'''.{{sfnm|1a1=Burt|1y=2013|1p=75|2a1=Carpenter|2y=1985|3a1=Lloyd|3y=1986|4a1=Powicke|4y=1947}} The first son of [[Henry III of England|Henry&nbsp;III]], Edward was involved from an early age in the political intrigues of his father's reign, which included an outright rebellion by the English [[baron]]s. In 1259, he briefly sided with a baronial reform movement, supporting the [[Provisions of Oxford]]. After reconciliation with his father, however, he remained loyal throughout the subsequent armed conflict, known as the [[Second Barons' War]]. After the [[Battle of Lewes]], Edward was hostage to the rebellious barons, but escaped after a few months and defeated the baronial leader [[Simon de Montfort]] at the [[Battle of Evesham]] in 1265. Within two years the rebellion was extinguished and, with England pacified, Edward joined the [[Ninth Crusade]] to the [[Holy Land]]. He was on his way home in 1272 when he was informed that his father had died. Making a slow return, he reached England in 1274 and was crowned at [[Westminster Abbey]].\n\nEdward spent much of his reign reforming royal administration and [[common law]]. Through an extensive legal inquiry, he investigated the tenure of various [[feudal]] liberties, while the law was reformed through a series of [[statute]]s regulating criminal and property law. Increasingly, however, Edward's attention was drawn towards military affairs. After suppressing a minor rebellion in Wales in 1276\u201377, Edward responded to a second rebellion in 1282\u201383 with [[Conquest of Wales by Edward I|a full-scale war of conquest]]. After a successful campaign, he subjected Wales to English rule, built a series of castles and towns in the countryside and settled them with [[English people]]. Next, his efforts were directed towards the [[Kingdom of Scotland]]. Initially invited to arbitrate [[Competitors for the Crown of Scotland|a succession dispute]], Edward claimed feudal [[suzerainty]] over Scotland. [[First Scottish War of Independence|The war]] that followed continued after Edward's death, even though the English seemed victorious at several points. Simultaneously, Edward found himself at [[Anglo-French War (1294\u20131303)|war with France]] (a [[Auld Alliance|Scottish ally]]) after King [[Philip IV of France]] had confiscated the [[Duchy of Gascony]], which until then had been held in [[personal union]] with the [[Kingdom of England]]. Although Edward recovered his duchy, this conflict relieved English military pressure against Scotland. At the same time there were problems at home. In the mid-1290s, extensive military campaigns required high levels of [[tax]]ation, and Edward met with both [[Laity|lay]] and ecclesiastical opposition. These crises were initially averted, but issues remained unsettled. When the King died in 1307, he left to his son [[Edward&nbsp;II]] an ongoing war with Scotland and many financial and political problems.\n\nEdward I was a tall man (6'2\") for his era, hence the nickname \"Longshanks\". He was temperamental, and this, along with his height, made him an intimidating man, and he often instilled fear in his contemporaries. Nevertheless, he held the respect of his subjects for the way he embodied the medieval ideal of kingship, as a soldier, an administrator and a man of faith. Modern historians are divided on their assessment of Edward: while some have praised him for his contribution to the law and administration, others have criticised him for his uncompromising attitude towards his nobility. Currently, Edward&nbsp;I is credited with many accomplishments during his reign, including restoring royal authority after the reign of Henry&nbsp;III, establishing [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] as a permanent institution and thereby also a functional system for raising taxes, and reforming the law through statutes. At the same time, he is also often criticised for other actions, such as his brutal conduct towards the Welsh and Scots, and issuing the [[Edict of Expulsion]] in 1290, by which the Jews were expelled from England. The Edict remained in effect for the rest of the [[Middle Ages]], and it was over 350 years until it was formally overturned under [[Oliver Cromwell]] in 1657.\n\n==Early years, 1239\u201363==\n\n===Childhood and marriage===\n[[File:Edward I and Eleanor.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Inside an initial letter are drawn two heads with necks, a male over a female.

The historian Michael Prestwich states that his \"long arms gave him an advantage as a swordsman, long thighs one as a horseman. In youth, his curly hair was blond; in maturity it darkened, and in old age it turned white.

He had already received Gascony as early as 1249, but [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester]], had been appointed as royal lieutenant the year before and, consequently, drew its income, so in practice Edward derived neither authority nor revenue from this province.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=7\u20138}}</ref> The grant he received in 1254 included most of Ireland, and much land in Wales and England, including the [[earldom of Chester]], but King Henry retained much control over the land in question, particularly in Ireland, so Edward's power was limited there as well, and the King derived most of the income from those lands.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=11\u201314}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1254 to 1257, Edward was under the influence of his mother's relatives, known as the Savoyards,<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|2007 |p=96}}</ref> the most notable of whom was [[Peter II of Savoy]], the Queen's uncle.<ref>{{Harvnb|Morris|2009|p=7}}</ref> After 1257, Edward increasingly fell in with the Poitevin or [[Lusignan]] faction&nbsp;\u2013 the half-brothers of his father Henry&nbsp;III&nbsp;\u2013 led by such men as [[William de Valence]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=22\u201323}}</ref>{{efn|Henry&nbsp;III's mother [[Isabella of Angoul\u00eame]] married [[Hugh X of Lusignan]] after the death of King [[John of England]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=21}}</ref>}} This association was significant, because the two groups of privileged foreigners were resented by the established English aristocracy, and they would be at the centre of the ensuing years' baronial reform movement.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|2007|p=95}}</ref> There were tales of unruly and violent conduct by Edward and his Lusignan kinsmen, which raised questions about Edward's personal qualities. The next years would be formative on his character.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=23}}</ref>\n\n===Early ambitions===\nEdward had shown independence in political matters as early as 1255, when he sided with the Soler family in Gascony, in the ongoing conflict between the Soler and Colomb families. This ran contrary to his father's policy of mediation between the local factions.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=15\u201316}}</ref> In May 1258, a group of [[magnate]]s drew up a document for reform of the King's government&nbsp;\u2013 the so-called [[Provisions of Oxford]]&nbsp;\u2013 largely directed against the Lusignans. Edward stood by his political allies and strongly opposed the Provisions. The reform movement succeeded in limiting the Lusignan influence, however, and gradually Edward's attitude started to change. In March 1259, he entered into a formal alliance with one of the main reformers, [[Richard de Clare, 6th Earl of Gloucester]]. Then, on 15&nbsp;October 1259, he announced that he supported the barons' goals, and their leader, Simon de Montfort.<ref>{{Harvnb|Carpenter|1985}}</ref>\n\nThe motive behind Edward's change of heart could have been purely pragmatic; Montfort was in a good position to support his cause in Gascony.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=31\u201332}}</ref> When the King left for France in November, Edward's behaviour turned into pure insubordination. He made several appointments to advance the cause of the reformers, causing his father to believe that Edward was considering a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=32\u201333}}</ref> When the King returned from France, he initially refused to see his son, but through the mediation of the Earl of Cornwall and [[Boniface, Archbishop of Canterbury]], the two were eventually reconciled.<ref>{{Harvnb|Morris|2009|pp=44\u201345}}</ref> Edward was sent abroad, and in November 1260 he again united with the Lusignans, who had been exiled to France.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=34}}</ref>\n\nBack in England, early in 1262, Edward fell out with some of his former Lusignan allies over financial matters. The next year, King Henry sent him on a campaign in Wales against [[Llywelyn ap Gruffudd]], with only limited results.<ref>{{Harvnb|Powicke|1962|pp=171\u2013172}}</ref> Around the same time, Montfort, who had been out of the country since 1261, returned to England and reignited the baronial reform movement.<ref>{{Harvnb|Maddicott|1994|p=225}}</ref> It was at this pivotal moment, as the King seemed ready to resign to the barons' demands, that Edward began to take control of the situation. Whereas he had so far been unpredictable and equivocating, from this point on he remained firmly devoted to protecting his father's royal rights.<ref>{{Harvnb|Powicke|1962|pp=178}}</ref> He reunited with some of the men he had alienated the year before&nbsp;\u2013 among them his childhood friend, Henry of Almain, and [[John de Warenne, 6th Earl of Surrey]]&nbsp;\u2013 and retook [[Windsor Castle]] from the rebels.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=41}}</ref> Through the arbitration of King [[Louis&nbsp;IX of France]], an agreement was made between the two parties. This so-called [[Mise of Amiens]] was largely favourable to the royalist side, and laid the seeds for further conflict.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|2007|p=113}}</ref>\n\n==Civil war and crusades, 1264\u201373==\n\n===Second Barons' War===\n{{main|Second Barons' War}}\n\nThe years 1264\u20131267 saw the conflict known as the [[Second Barons' War]], in which baronial forces led by Simon de Montfort fought against those who remained loyal to the King. The first scene of battle was the city of [[Gloucester]], which Edward managed to retake from the enemy. When [[Robert de Ferrers, 6th Earl of Derby]], came to the assistance of the rebels, Edward negotiated a truce with the Earl, the terms of which Edward later broke. He then captured [[Northampton]] from [[Simon de Montfort the Younger]] before embarking on a retaliatory campaign against Derby's lands.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=42\u201343}}</ref> The baronial and royalist forces finally met at the [[Battle of Lewes]], on 14&nbsp;May 1264. Edward, commanding the right wing, performed well, and soon defeated the London contingent of Montfort's forces.

To stage a European-wide crusade, it was essential to prevent conflict between the greater princes on the continent. A major obstacle to this was represented by the conflict between the French [[Capetian House of Anjou]] ruling southern Italy, and the [[Kingdom of Aragon]] in Spain. In 1282, the citizens of Palermo rose up against Charles of Anjou and turned for help to [[Peter III of Aragon]], in what has become known as the [[Sicilian Vespers]]. In the war that followed, Charles of Anjou's son, [[Charles of Salerno]], was taken prisoner by the Aragonese.<ref>{{Harvnb|Powicke|1962|pp=252\u2013253}}</ref> The French began planning an attack on Aragon, raising the prospect of a large-scale European war.

The initial resistance was not caused by the lay taxes, however, but by clerical subsidies. In 1294, Edward made a demand of a grant of one half of all clerical revenues. There was some resistance, but the King responded by threatening with [[outlaw]]ry, and the grant was eventually made.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=403\u2013404}}</ref> At the time, the [[Archbishop of Canterbury|archbishopric of Canterbury]] was vacant, since [[Robert Winchelsey]] was in Italy to receive consecration.<ref name=Powicke1962P671/>{{efn|Winchelsey's consecration was held up by the protracted [[1292\u20131294 papal election]].<ref name=Powicke1962P671>{{Harvnb|Powicke|1962|p=671}}</ref>}} Winchelsey returned in January 1295 and had to consent to another grant in November of that year.

This resistance focused on two things: the King's right to demand military service, and his right to levy taxes. At the Salisbury parliament of February 1297, [[Earl Marshal]] [[Roger Bigod, 5th Earl of Norfolk]], objected to a royal summons of military service. Bigod argued that the military obligation only extended to service alongside the King; if the King intended to sail to Flanders, he could not send his subjects to Gascony.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1972|p=251}}</ref> In July, Bigod and [[Humphrey de Bohun, 3rd Earl of Hereford]] and [[Constable of England]], drew up a series of complaints known as the [[Remonstrances]], in which objections to the extortionate level of taxation were voiced.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harriss|1975|p=61}}.</ref> Undeterred, Edward requested another lay subsidy.

It encompasses nearly half of Alaska's land area, {{convert|323,440|sqmi|km2}}, an area larger than any other U.S. state, and larger than the land area of the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|smallest 16 states]] combined. As of the [[2000 United States Census|2000 U.S. Census]], it had a population of 81,803, which was 13% of the population of the state.\n\n==Overview==\nUnique among the United States, Alaska is not entirely subdivided into organized [[county equivalents]]. To facilitate census-taking in the vast unorganized area, the [[United States Census Bureau]], in cooperation with the state, [[List_of_boroughs_and_census_areas_in_Alaska#Census_areas_in_the_Unorganized_Borough|divided the unorganized borough into 11 census areas]], beginning with the 1970 [[U.S. Census|Census]] and undergoing border or name adjustments most recently in 2007, 2008, 2013, 2015, and 2019<ref>https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/technical-documentation/county-changes.2010.html</ref>:\n\n*[[Aleutians West Census Area, Alaska|Aleutians West Census Area]]\n*[[Bethel Census Area, Alaska|Bethel Census Area]]\n*[[Dillingham Census Area, Alaska|Dillingham Census Area]]\n*[[Hoonah\u2013Angoon Census Area, Alaska|Hoonah\u2013Angoon Census Area]]\n*[[Kusilvak Census Area, Alaska|Kusilvak Census Area]]\n*[[Nome Census Area, Alaska|Nome Census Area]]\n*[[Prince of Wales \u2013 Hyder Census Area, Alaska|Prince of Wales \u2013 Hyder Census Area]] (including portions of the former [[Petersburg Borough, Alaska|Petersburg Census Area]])\n*[[Southeast Fairbanks Census Area, Alaska|Southeast Fairbanks Census Area]]\n*former [[Valdez\u2013Cordova Census Area, Alaska|Valdez\u2013Cordova Census Area]]\n**Split to form Chugach Census Area and Copper River Census Area, effective January 02, 2019.\n*[[Yukon\u2013Koyukuk Census Area, Alaska|Yukon\u2013Koyukuk Census Area]]\n\nThis vast area has no local government other than that of [[school districts]] and [[Municipal corporation|municipalities]] within its limits. Many of the villages do have [[Tribal sovereignty in the United States#Tribal governments today|tribal governments]], however. Except within some incorporated cities, all government services in the Unorganized Borough, including law enforcement, are provided by the state or by a tribal government. School districts in the Unorganized Borough are operated either by cities, in those limited instances when the city has chosen to undertake those powers, or through the general guidance of the [[Alaska Department of Education|state Department of Education]] under the auspices of Rural Education Attendance Areas.\n\n==History==\nDuring the 1950s, when the push for the [[territory of Alaska]] to become a state was at its height, any municipal government was extremely limited and scattered. Territory-wide, there were no more than a few dozen [[Municipal corporation|incorporated cities]], and a small handful of service districts, broken into [[public utility district]]s and [[independent school district]]s. The service districts were authorized by the territorial legislature in 1935 to allow unincorporated areas limited powers to provide services and to raise taxes for them.\n\nThe [[United States Congress]] had forbidden the territory from establishing counties.<ref>{{cite web|title=Governing Alaska: The Territory of Alaska|url=http://www.akhistorycourse.org/articles/article.php?artID=135|work=Alaska History and Cultural Studies|accessdate=22 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927002516/http://www.akhistorycourse.org/articles/article.php?artID=135|archive-date=September 27, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The delegates of the [[Constitutional convention (political meeting)|convention]] which wrote the [[Alaska Constitution]] had, in fact, debated the merits of establishing [[County (United States)|counties]], and had rejected the idea in favor of creating a system of boroughs, both organized and unorganized.\n\nThe intent of the framers of the constitution was to provide for maximum local [[self-government]] with a minimum of [[local government]] units and tax-levying jurisdictions. The minutes of the constitutional convention indicate that counties were not used as a form of local government for various reasons. The failure of some local economies to generate enough revenue to support separate counties was an important issue, as was the desire to use a model that would reflect the unique character of Alaska, provide for maximum local input, and avoid a body of county [[case law]] already in existence.\n\nInstead, Alaska adopted boroughs as a form of regional government. This regionalization tried to avoid having a number of independent, limited-purpose governments with confusing boundaries and inefficient governmental operations. The territorial service districts had amounted to this much{{clarify|date=April 2017}}, but were seen by many as an important foundation for the government to provide services without becoming all-powerful and unnecessarily intrusive, an argument which surfaced time and again during various attempts by the legislature to create organized boroughs out of portions of the unorganized borough.\n\nAlaska adopted the borough structure by statute in 1961, and envisioned boroughs to serve as an \"all-purpose\" form of local government, to avoid the perceived{{by whom|date=June 2013}} problems of county government in the [[Continental United States|lower 48 states]] as well as [[Hawaii]]. According to Article X of the Alaska Constitution, areas of the state unable to support borough government were to be served by several unorganized boroughs, which were to be mechanisms for the state to regionalize services; however, separate unorganized boroughs were never created. The entire state was defined as one vast unorganized borough by the Borough Act of 1961, and over the ensuing years, Alaska's organized boroughs were carved out of it.\n\nAlaska's first organized borough, and the only one incorporated immediately after passage of the 1961 legislation, was the [[Bristol Bay Borough]].

primary examples being [[North Slope Borough, Alaska|North Slope]], [[Northwest Arctic Borough, Alaska|Northwest Arctic]], and [[Denali Borough, Alaska|Denali]]) were incorporated to exploit a significant potential source of taxation, such as natural resource extraction and tourism.\n\nMany residents of the Unorganized Borough, particularly those in the larger communities which may be most susceptible to organized borough incorporation, have been vociferously opposed to such incorporation, and say the status quo suits them just fine. Many point out that they would already live in an organized borough if they desired that lifestyle and the level of government which comes with it.\n\nOn the other hand, many Alaskans residing in organized boroughs feel that they unfairly subsidize residents of the Unorganized Borough, especially for education. In 2003, the Alaska Division of Community Advocacy identified eight areas within the Unorganized Borough meeting standards for incorporation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.commerce.state.ak.us/dca/lbc/boroughstudy/study_materials.htm|title=Legislative Direct for Unorganized Borough Review|publisher=Alaska Department of Commerce|access-date=December 1, 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051201233151/http://www.commerce.state.ak.us/dca/lbc/boroughstudy/study_materials.htm|archive-date=December 1, 2005|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Bills have been introduced in the [[Alaska Legislature]] to compel these areas to incorporate, though {{As of|2009|lc=on}}, none have been signed into law.\n\n==Major communities==\n{{Div col}}\n*[[Bethel, Alaska|Bethel]] (the largest city in the Unorganized Borough)\n*[[Cordova, Alaska|Cordova]]\n*[[Craig, Alaska|Craig]]\n*[[Delta Junction, Alaska|Delta Junction]]\n*[[Deltana, Alaska|Deltana]]\n*[[Dillingham, Alaska|Dillingham]]\n*[[Edna Bay, Alaska|Edna Bay]]\n*[[Fort Yukon, Alaska|Fort Yukon]]\n*[[Hooper Bay, Alaska|Hooper Bay]]\n*[[Metlakatla, Alaska|Metlakatla]]\n*[[Nenana, Alaska|Nenana]]\n*[[Nome, Alaska|Nome]]\n*[[Tok, Alaska|Tok]]\n*[[Unalaska, Alaska|Unalaska]]\n*[[Valdez, Alaska|Valdez]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Portal|Alaska}}\n\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commonscat|Unorganized Borough, Alaska}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20051201233151/http://www.commerce.state.ak.us/dca/lbc/boroughstudy/study_materials.htm Legislative Directive for Unorganized Borough Review]\n*[https://www.commerce.alaska.gov/web/portals/4/pub/Model_Boro_RPT.pdf Map of proposed model borough boundaries] Alaska Department of Commerce, Community and Economic Development (1997)\n\n{{Alaska}}\n{{Unorganized Borough, Alaska}}\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Unorganized Borough, Alaska| ]]\n[[Category:Alaska boroughs]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date = December 2019}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=June 2013}}\n{{Infobox U.S. County\n|county  = Unorganized Borough\n|state = Alaska\n| ex image           = NENANA DEPOT.jpg\n| ex image size      = 300px\n| ex image cap       = [[Nenana Depot]]\n|seal =\n|founded year = \n|founded date = \n|founded title = \n|seat = ''None''\n|largest city wl = Bethel\n|city type = community\n|area_total_sq_mi =323,440\n|area_land_sq_mi  =\n|area_water_sq_mi =\n|area percentage = \n|census yr = 2000\n|pop = 81,803\n|density_sq_mi =\n|web = \n|district = \n|time zone = Alaska\n|named for = \n}}\n\nThe '''Unorganized Borough''' is made up of the portions of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Alaska]] which are not contained in any of its 19 organized [[List_of_boroughs_and_census_areas_in_Alaska|boroughs]]. It encompasses nearly half of Alaska's land area, {{convert|323,440|sqmi|km2}}, an area larger than any other U.S. state, and larger than the land area of the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|smallest 16 states]] combined. As of the [[2000 United States Census|2000 U.S. Census]], it had a population of 81,803, which was 13% of the population of the state.\n\n==Overview==\nUnique among the United States, Alaska is not entirely subdivided into organized [[county equivalents]]. To facilitate census-taking in the vast unorganized area, the [[United States Census Bureau]], in cooperation with the state, divided the unorganized borough into 11 [[census area]]s, beginning with the 1970 [[U.S. Census|Census]]. The [[Petersburg Borough, Alaska|Petersburg Census Area]] was made a borough in 2013, leaving 10 census areas in the Unorganized Borough:\n*[[Aleutians West Census Area, Alaska|Aleutians West Census Area]]\n*[[Bethel Census Area, Alaska|Bethel Census Area]]\n*[[Dillingham Census Area, Alaska|Dillingham Census Area]]\n*[[Hoonah\u2013Angoon Census Area, Alaska|Hoonah\u2013Angoon Census Area]]\n*[[Kusilvak Census Area, Alaska|Kusilvak Census Area]]\n*[[Nome Census Area, Alaska|Nome Census Area]]\n*[[Prince of Wales \u2013 Hyder Census Area, Alaska|Prince of Wales \u2013 Hyder Census Area]]\n*[[Southeast Fairbanks Census Area, Alaska|Southeast Fairbanks Census Area]]\n*[[Valdez\u2013Cordova Census Area, Alaska|Valdez\u2013Cordova Census Area]]\n**Split to form Chugach Census Area and Copper River Census Area, effective January 02, 2019.\n*[[Yukon\u2013Koyukuk Census Area, Alaska|Yukon\u2013Koyukuk Census Area]]\n\nThis vast area has no local government other than that of [[school districts]] and [[Municipal corporation|municipalities]] within its limits. Many of the villages do have [[Tribal sovereignty in the United States#Tribal governments today|tribal governments]], however. Except within some incorporated cities, all government services in the Unorganized Borough, including law enforcement, are provided by the state or by a tribal government. School districts in the Unorganized Borough are operated either by cities, in those limited instances when the city has chosen to undertake those powers, or through the general guidance of the [[Alaska Department of Education|state Department of Education]] under the auspices of Rural Education Attendance Areas.\n\n==History==\nDuring the 1950s, when the push for the [[territory of Alaska]] to become a state was at its height, any municipal government was extremely limited and scattered. Territory-wide, there were no more than a few dozen [[Municipal corporation|incorporated cities]], and a small handful of service districts, broken into [[public utility district]]s and [[independent school district]]s. The service districts were authorized by the territorial legislature in 1935 to allow unincorporated areas limited powers to provide services and to raise taxes for them.\n\nThe [[United States Congress]] had forbidden the territory from establishing counties.<ref>{{cite web|title=Governing Alaska: The Territory of Alaska|url=http://www.akhistorycourse.org/articles/article.php?artID=135|work=Alaska History and Cultural Studies|accessdate=22 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927002516/http://www.akhistorycourse.org/articles/article.php?artID=135|archive-date=September 27, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The delegates of the [[Constitutional convention (political meeting)|convention]] which wrote the [[Alaska Constitution]] had, in fact, debated the merits of establishing [[County (United States)|counties]], and had rejected the idea in favor of creating a system of boroughs, both organized and unorganized.\n\nThe intent of the framers of the constitution was to provide for maximum local [[self-government]] with a minimum of [[local government]] units and tax-levying jurisdictions. The minutes of the constitutional convention indicate that counties were not used as a form of local government for various reasons. The failure of some local economies to generate enough revenue to support separate counties was an important issue, as was the desire to use a model that would reflect the unique character of Alaska, provide for maximum local input, and avoid a body of county [[case law]] already in existence.\n\nInstead, Alaska adopted boroughs as a form of regional government. This regionalization tried to avoid having a number of independent, limited-purpose governments with confusing boundaries and inefficient governmental operations. The territorial service districts had amounted to this much{{clarify|date=April 2017}}, but were seen by many as an important foundation for the government to provide services without becoming all-powerful and unnecessarily intrusive, an argument which surfaced time and again during various attempts by the legislature to create organized boroughs out of portions of the unorganized borough.\n\nAlaska adopted the borough structure by statute in 1961, and envisioned boroughs to serve as an \"all-purpose\" form of local government, to avoid the perceived{{by whom|date=June 2013}} problems of county government in the [[Continental United States|lower 48 states]] as well as [[Hawaii]]. According to Article X of the Alaska Constitution, areas of the state unable to support borough government were to be served by several unorganized boroughs, which were to be mechanisms for the state to regionalize services; however, separate unorganized boroughs were never created. The entire state was defined as one vast unorganized borough by the Borough Act of 1961, and over the ensuing years, Alaska's organized boroughs were carved out of it.\n\nAlaska's first organized borough, and the only one incorporated immediately after passage of the 1961 legislation, was the [[Bristol Bay Borough]]. The pressure from residents of other areas of the state to form boroughs led to the Mandatory Borough Act of 1963, which called for all election districts in the state over a certain minimum population to incorporate as boroughs by January 1, 1964.\n\nA resolution of the State of Alaska's Local Boundary Commission introduced in January 2009 spells this out in greater detail:\n\n*''WHEREAS, the 1963 Alaska State Legislature passed, and [[William Allen Egan|Governor Egan]] signed into law, the \"Mandatory Borough Act\" (Chapter 52, SLA 1963), dictating that certain regions of Alaska - those encompassing [[Ketchikan]], [[Juneau]], [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]], [[Kodiak Island]], [[Kenai Peninsula]], [[Anchorage]], the [[Matanuska-Susitna Valley|Matanuska-Susitna valleys]], and [[Fairbanks]] - form organized boroughs by January 1, 1964.<ref>[http://www.ci.valdez.ak.us/clerk/documents/Rep2021709.pdf The document on Valdez municipal website]</ref>\n\nFurthermore, 21 Rural Education Attendance Areas were established by the Legislature in 1975.

primary examples being [[North Slope Borough, Alaska|North Slope]], [[Northwest Arctic Borough, Alaska|Northwest Arctic]], and [[Denali Borough, Alaska|Denali]]) were incorporated to exploit a significant potential source of taxation, such as natural resource extraction and tourism.\n\nMany residents of the Unorganized Borough, particularly those in the larger communities which may be most susceptible to organized borough incorporation, have been vociferously opposed to such incorporation, and say the status quo suits them just fine. Many point out that they would already live in an organized borough if they desired that lifestyle and the level of government which comes with it.\n\nOn the other hand, many Alaskans residing in organized boroughs feel that they unfairly subsidize residents of the Unorganized Borough, especially for education. In 2003, the Alaska Division of Community Advocacy identified eight areas within the Unorganized Borough meeting standards for incorporation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.commerce.state.ak.us/dca/lbc/boroughstudy/study_materials.htm|title=Legislative Direct for Unorganized Borough Review|publisher=Alaska Department of Commerce|access-date=December 1, 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051201233151/http://www.commerce.state.ak.us/dca/lbc/boroughstudy/study_materials.htm|archive-date=December 1, 2005|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Bills have been introduced in the [[Alaska Legislature]] to compel these areas to incorporate, though {{As of|2009|lc=on}}, none have been signed into law.\n\n==Major communities==\n{{Div col}}\n*[[Bethel, Alaska|Bethel]] (the largest city in the Unorganized Borough)\n*[[Cordova, Alaska|Cordova]]\n*[[Craig, Alaska|Craig]]\n*[[Delta Junction, Alaska|Delta Junction]]\n*[[Deltana, Alaska|Deltana]]\n*[[Dillingham, Alaska|Dillingham]]\n*[[Edna Bay, Alaska|Edna Bay]]\n*[[Fort Yukon, Alaska|Fort Yukon]]\n*[[Hooper Bay, Alaska|Hooper Bay]]\n*[[Metlakatla, Alaska|Metlakatla]]\n*[[Nenana, Alaska|Nenana]]\n*[[Nome, Alaska|Nome]]\n*[[Tok, Alaska|Tok]]\n*[[Unalaska, Alaska|Unalaska]]\n*[[Valdez, Alaska|Valdez]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Portal|Alaska}}\n\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commonscat|Unorganized Borough, Alaska}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20051201233151/http://www.commerce.state.ak.us/dca/lbc/boroughstudy/study_materials.htm Legislative Directive for Unorganized Borough Review]\n*[https://www.commerce.alaska.gov/web/portals/4/pub/Model_Boro_RPT.pdf Map of proposed model borough boundaries] Alaska Department of Commerce, Community and Economic Development (1997)\n\n{{Alaska}}\n{{Unorganized Borough, Alaska}}\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Unorganized Borough, Alaska| ]]\n[[Category:Alaska boroughs]]\n", "name_user": "Namangwari", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eOverview:note about changed names and borders of census areas", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unorganized_Borough,_Alaska"}
