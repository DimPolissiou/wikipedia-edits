Often it is called just thus: \"Basic Movement\" or \"Basic Step\". For some dances it is sufficient to know the basic step performed in different [[#Handhold|handhold]]s and [[#Dance position|dance positions]] to enjoy it socially.\n\n=== Basic step ===\n''Same as [[#Basic movement|Basic movement]].''\n=== Box step ===\n[[Box Step]] is a dance figure named so because the steps rest in the four corners of a square. It is used, e.g., in [[Glossary of partner dance terms#American Style|American Style]] ballroom dances: [[Rhumba|Rumba]] bronze-level [[Foxtrot (dance)|Foxtrot]]. The leader begins with the left foot and proceeds as follows.\n:''First half-box'': Forward-side-together\n:''Second half-box'': Backwards-side-together\nEvery step is with [[full weight transfer]]. during the second and fourth step it is advised the foot to travel along two sides of the box, rather than along its diagonal.\n\nRhythm varies. E.g., it is \"1-2-3,4-5-6\" in Waltz and \"Sqq, Sqq\" in Rumba.\n\n=== Chaines / Chain\u00e9 turns / Chaines turns ===\n\nSee [[Glossary of ballet terms#Cha\u00een\u00e9s]].\n\nFrench for 'chain', a series of quick turns on first position alternating flat or relev\u00e9 feet with progression along a straight line or circle. A Chain\u00e9 turn is when you stand on relev\u00e9 and turn.\n\n===Chasse===\n[[Chasse]] is a dance step with a triple step pattern used in many forms of dance. It is a gliding, flowing step with the feet essentially following a step together step pattern. Timing and length of steps vary from dance to dance.\n\n=== Closed change ===\n[[Closed and Open Changes|Closed Change]] is a basic step in the [[Waltz]]. The man steps forward on either foot whilst the lady steps backward on the opposing foot (e.g.: the man steps forward on his right foot whilst the lady steps back on her left). They will then step to the side on the other foot, and conclude the figure by closing the first foot beside the second (hence the name \"closed\" of the step). Each step takes up a full beat of the music.\n\n=== Cross-body lead ===\nCross-body lead is a common and useful move in [[Latin dance]]s such as [[Salsa (dance)|Salsa]], [[Mambo (dance)|Mambo]], [[Rhumba|Rumba]] and [[Cha-cha-cha (dance)|Cha-cha-cha]].  Basically, the man on counts 2 and 3 of his basic step (assuming dancing on 1) does a quarter-left turn (90\u00b0 counterclockwise) while still holding on to the woman.  On counts 4 and 5, he leads the woman forward across him, i.e., firmly leads her with his right hand on her back, so that she travels across and turns around and faces the opposite direction she was facing.  At the same time, the man does another quarter-left turn as necessary in order to follow the woman and face her.  At the end of the move, the dancers have their positions exchanged.\n\nThe cross-body lead can be done with single-hand or double hand hold, with or without a woman's underarm turn, or leading the woman to do a [[Glossary of dance moves#Free spin|free spin]].\n\n=== Dos-\u00e0-dos, Dosado ===\n\n[[Dosado]] is a circular movement where two people, who are initially facing each other, walk around each other without or almost without turning, i.e., facing in the same direction (same wall) all the time.\n\n===Enchufla===\nThis is a dance movement common in [[Salsa (dance)|salsa]], where the two dance partners facing each other change positions. The dance partners keep contact with one or two hands while stepping to  rotate concentrically over 180 degrees around the same point in opposite directions.\n\n=== Feather step===\nThe [[Feather (step)|Feather]] is a basic figure in [[Ballroom dance#International Style|International Style]] [[Foxtrot (dance)|Foxtrot]], in which the man makes three or four steps  basically forward, with the third one (right foot) done outside the lady.\n\n=== [[Floss (dance)]] ===\n\n=== Free spin ===\nIn [[lead and follow]] dance, a [[dance turn]] performed without partner contact.\n\n===Gancho===\n\"[[Gancho (dance move)|Gancho]]\" means \"hook\" in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and describes certain \"hooking actions\" in some dances of Latin American heritage, in [[Argentine Tango]] (leg action) and [[Salsa (dance)|Salsa]] (arm action and foot action) in particular.\n\n===Grapevine===\n\nStep on leg, working leg goes behind, stepping to the side then join.\n\n===Heel turn===\nA ballroom dance move, which is the turn on the heel of the [[support foot]] while the other foot is held close and parallel to the support one. At the end of the turn the weight is transferred from one foot to another.<ref name=am/>\n\n===Heel pull===\nA variant of the [[#Heel turn]], in which the feet are kept apart.<ref name=am/>\n\n=== Inside partner step ===\n\nA step taken forward into the space occupied by the partner, while the partner steps backwards. During this step feet [[Glossary of partner dance terms#Track of foot|tracks]] of both partners overlap. See also [[#Outside partner step]].\n\n=== Inside turn ===\n\nThe term is applied to an individual turn of a partner in the couple. Basically, it denotes a turn where the arm of the partner doing the turn begins by moving towards the \"inside\" of the couple (the line running from the center of one partner to the center of the other). The meaning is intuitively clear, but it may be performed in numerous ways and in different handholds, so that even accomplished dancers are confused. In dances such as swing and salsa, inside and outside turns most commonly refer to underarm turns done by the follower.  Since in these dances the follower's right arm is normally used to lead a turn (most commonly by the leader's left arm, but sometimes by the leader's right arm when a cross-hand or \"handshake\" position is used), an inside turn is normally a left (counter-clockwise) turn, while an outside turn is a right (clockwise) turn.  However, if the follower's left arm is used to initiate the turn, the intended direction of turning may be opposite. (Alternatively, the non-ambiguous terms \"left turn\" and \"right turn\" may be used.)\n\nSee [[Direction of movement (dance)|Direction of movement]] for more detail.\n\n==L-Z==\n\n=== Lock Step ===\nA [[Lock step (dance)|Lock step]] is an alternative variation of a [[chasse]] action which occurs when the moving foot swings to a stop across the track of the standing foot rather than closing next to it.  In the Latin dances the combination of the crossed position and the turnout of the feet means that the rear toe will be pointed at the heel of the other foot, while in the Standard dances the lack of turnout means the feet will be parallel.  In [[Glossary of partner dance terms#Standard|Standard]] the basic locking action is usually preceded and followed by a left [[side lead]].  The [[Glossary of partner dance terms#Latin|Latin]] lock step is often featured when [[Cha-cha-cha (dance)|Cha-cha]] is danced in [[Open position]] with a one-hand hold.\n\n===Moonwalk===\nThe [[Moonwalk (dance)|Moonwalk]] is a dance technique that presents the illusion of the dancer being pulled backwards while attempting to walk forward.\n\n===Natural turn===\n[[Natural and reverse turns|Natural turns]] and some other figures are those in which the dance couple rotates to the right (clockwise).\n\n=== Open turn ===\nA ballroom dance figure in which during the last step the moving foot passes the [[support foot]], rather than closes to it.<ref name=am>[[Alex Moore (dancer)|Moore, Alex]] (2002/1972). ''Ballroom Dancing'', section \"Definition of technical terms\". Taylor & Francis. 10th edition. {{ISBN|9780878301539}}.</ref>\n\n=== Outside partner step ===\n\nA step taken with the partner beside the [[Glossary of partner dance terms#Moving foot|moving foot]] (e.g., to the left of the left moving foot).  During this step [[Glossary of partner dance terms#Track of foot|feet tracks]] of both partners do not overlap.  See also [[#Inside partner step]].\n\n=== Outside turn ===\n''Cf. [[#Inside turn|Inside turn]].''\n\nThe term is applied to an individual turn of a partner in the couple. Basically, it denotes the lead/follow connection directed \"outside\" of the center of the spinning individual. Inside and Outside terminology can not be determined by relativity to partnership as such position alternates every 180 degrees of rotation. Connection points and application of active side are consistent only with regard to the axis of rotation and direction of spin.\n\nSee [[Direction of movement (dance)|Direction of movement]] for more detail.\n\nPirouette\n\nThis term usually refers to turning or spinning on one foot while touching the standing leg with the opposite leg in a bent position.\n\n===Reverse turn===\n[[Natural and reverse turns|Reverse turns]] and some other figures are those in which the dance couple rotates to the left (counterclockwise).\n\n=== Rond ===\n''See [[Ballet glossary#Rond de jambe]]''.\nA toe of the straight leg draws a semicircle on the floor. In ballroom dances the direction is usually from the front to back.\n\n===Telemark===\n{{main|Telemark (waltz)}}\n\n===Thunder clap===\nThe '''Thunder Clap''' is a form of [[dance]] that incorporates [[clapping]] in the air with a sliding motion.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} To perform this dance one must raise one hand and then with the second hand meet the first one half way making a clapping sound; that hand must then fully extend. This motion is repeated to the beat of the music.\n\n=== Time Step ===\n\n*In [[tap dancing]], the Time Step is a recognizable rhythmic tap combination. The term comes from the time of great tap dancers that used their distinctive Time Step to tell the band the desired tempo. Common tap time steps are classified as single, double and triple. The basic rhythm and tempo remain the same but the number of sounds that happen on the second and sixth count of an eight-count phrase denotes single (often a single step) double (usually a flap or slap-tap) or triple (commonly shuffle-step). While these are the universal time steps, dancers often choose to create their own time steps, following the pattern two bars repeated three times with a two bar [[break (music)|break]].\n*[[Time Steps (Cha-cha-cha)|Time Steps]] is a figure in [[#International Style|International Style]] Cha-cha-cha.\n*In various rhythmic ballroom/social dances, ''Time Step'' sometimes refers to steps in place that mark the characteristic rhythm of the dance, \"2-3-cha-cha-cha\" for Cha-cha-cha, \"1,2,3,4\" for [[Paso Doble]], \"1,2,3,...5,6,7,...\" for \"[[Salsa (dance)|Salsa]] on One\", etc..\n\n=== Walk ===\nThe [[Promenade (dance move)|Walk]] is probably the most basic dance move. It exists in almost every dance. Walks approximately correspond normal walking steps, taking into the account the basic technique of the dance in question. (For example, in [[Latin dance]] walks the toe hits the floor first, rather than the heel.)\n\nIn dance descriptions the term ''walk'' is usually applied when two or more steps are taken in the same direction. A single step, e.g., forward, is called just thus: 'step forward'.\n\nWalks can be done in various dance positions: in =\n'''Curved walks''' are done along a curve, rather than along a straight line.\n\nYou can also just move forwards with your feet\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{More citations needed|date=July 2009}}\n{{Dance}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Glossary Of Dance Moves}}\n[[Category:Dance moves| ]]\n[[Category:Glossaries of dance|Dance moves]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Wikipedia glossary}}\n== A-K ==\n\n=== Ball change ===\nThe turn of a foot that is in fifth position.
