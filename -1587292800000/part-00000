In the north, the plateau is connected to a neighbouring mountain range by a narrow promontory. In all other directions, the ridge descends steeply into slopes and steep cliffs.<ref>Klaus Schmidt: ''Sie bauten die ersten Tempel. Das r\u00e4tselhafte Heiligtum der Steinzeitj\u00e4ger. Die arch\u00e4ologische Entdeckung am G\u00f6bekli Tepe.'' Munich 2006, p. 102.</ref> On top of the ridge there is considerable evidence of human impact, in addition to the construction of the tell. Excavations have taken place at the southern slope of the tell, south and west of a [[mulberry]] that marks an Islamic pilgrimage,<ref>Klaus Schmidt: ''G\u00f6bekli Tepe. Eine Beschreibung der wichtigsten Befunde erstellt nach den Arbeiten der Grabungsteams der Jahre 1995\u20132007''. In: ''Erste Tempel - Fr\u00fche Siedlungen. 12000 Jahre Kunst und Kultur. Ausgrabungen und Forschungen zwischen Donau und Euphrat. Oldenburg 2009, p. 188.</ref> but archaeological finds come from the entire plateau. The team has also found many remains of tools.\n\n===Plateau===\n[[File:G\u00f6bekli Tepe surrounding area.JPG|thumb|left|G\u00f6bekli Tepe surrounding area]]\n[[File:G\u00f6bekli2012-20.jpg|thumb|left|Complex E]]\n[[File:Gobekli Tepe 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Pillar 2 from Enclosure A (Layer III) with [[low relief]]s of what are believed to be a [[bull]], [[fox]], and [[crane (bird)|crane]]]]\n\nThe plateau has been transformed by erosion and by [[quarry]]ing, which took place not only in the Neolithic, but also in classical times. There are four {{convert|10|m|ft|adj=mid|-long}} and {{convert|20|cm|in|adj=mid|-wide}} channels on the southern part of the plateau, interpreted as the remains of an ancient quarry from which rectangular blocks were taken. These possibly are related to a square building in the neighbourhood, of which only the foundation is preserved. Presumably this is the remains of a Roman [[watchtower]] that was part of the [[Limes Arabicus]], however, this is conjecture.<ref name=\"Schmitt 2006, p. 105\">Schmidt 2006, p. 105</ref>\n\nMost structures on the plateau seem to be the result of Neolithic quarrying, with the quarries being used as sources for the huge, monolithic architectural elements. Their profiles were pecked into the rock, with the detached blocks then levered out of the rock bank.<ref name=\"Schmitt 2006, p. 105\"/> Several quarries where round workpieces had been produced were identified. Their status as quarries was confirmed by the find of a 3-by-3&nbsp;metre piece at the southeastern slope of the plateau. Unequivocally Neolithic are three T-shaped pillars that had not yet been levered out of the bedrock. The largest of them lies on the northern plateau. It has a length of {{convert|7|m|0|abbr=on}} and its head has a width of {{convert|3|m|0|abbr=on}}. Its weight may be around 50 tons. The two other unfinished pillars lie on the southern Plateau.\n\n===Tell===\nAt the western edge of the hill, a lionlike figure was found. In this area, [[flint]] and limestone fragments occur more frequently. It was therefore suggested that this could have been some kind of sculpture workshop.<ref>Schmidt 2006, pp. 109\u2013111</ref> It is unclear, on the other hand, how to classify three [[phallus|phallic]] depictions from the surface of the southern plateau. They are near the quarries of classical times, making their dating difficult.<ref name=\"Schmidtp111\">Schmidt 2006, p. 111</ref>\n\nApart from the tell, there is an incised platform with two sockets that could have held pillars, and a surrounding flat bench. This platform corresponds to the complexes from Layer&nbsp;III at the tell. Continuing the naming pattern, it is called \"complex&nbsp;E\". Owing to its similarity to the cult-buildings at [[Neval\u0131 \u00c7ori]] it has also been called \"Temple of the Rock\". Its floor has been carefully hewn out of the bedrock and smoothed, reminiscent of the [[terrazzo]] floors of the younger complexes at G\u00f6bekli Tepe. Immediately northwest of this area are two cistern-like pits that is believed to be part of complex&nbsp;E. One of these pits has a table-high pin as well as a staircase with five steps.<ref>Schmidt 2006, p. 109</ref>\n\nAt the western [[escarpment]], a small cave has been discovered in which a small [[relief]] depicting a [[bovid]] was found. It is the only relief found in this cave.<ref name=\"Schmidtp111\" />\n\n===Layer III===\n{{multiple image\n| align    = right\n| direction =horizontal\n| header=Animal sculpture (ca. 9,000 BC)\n| total_width=400\n| image1   = GobeklitepeHeykel.jpg\n| image2   = Gobeklitepe_animal_sculpture,_circa_9000_BCE.jpg\n| footer=<center>Pillar 27 from Enclosure C (Layer III) with the sculpture of a predatory animal in high relief catching a prey in low relief.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Steadman |first1=Sharon R. |last2=McMahon |first2=Gregory |title=The Oxford Handbook of Ancient Anatolia: (10,000-323 BCE) |date=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press USA |isbn=9780195376142 |page=923 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TY3t4y_L5SQC&pg=PA923 |language=en}}</ref></center>\n}}\n\nAt this early stage of the site's history, circular compounds or ''[[Temenos|temene]]'' first appear. They range from 10 to 30 metres in diameter. Their most notable feature is the presence of T-shaped limestone pillars evenly set within thick interior walls composed of unworked stone. Four such circular structures have been unearthed so far. Geophysical surveys indicate that there are 16 more, enclosing up to eight pillars each, amounting to nearly 200 pillars in all. The slabs were transported from bedrock pits located approximately 100 metres (330&nbsp;ft) from the hilltop, with workers using flint points to cut through the limestone bedrock.<ref>Schmidt 2000b, pp. 52\u201353</ref>\n\n[[File:G\u00f6bekli Tepe Pillar.JPG|thumb|left|Pillar with the sculpture of a fox]]\n[[File:G\u00f6bekli2012-3.jpg|thumb|left|Monolith with possible bird figures.]]\n\nTwo taller pillars stand facing one another at the centre of each circle. Whether the circles were provided with a roof is uncertain. Stone benches designed for sitting are found in the interior.<ref>Mithen 2004, p. 65</ref> Many of the pillars are decorated with [[Abstract art|abstract]], enigmatic [[pictogram]]s and carved animal reliefs. The pictograms may represent commonly understood sacred symbols, as known from [[Neolithic]] [[cave paintings]] elsewhere. The reliefs depict mammals such as lions, bulls, boars, foxes, gazelles, and donkeys; snakes and other reptiles; [[arthropod]]s such as insects and arachnids; and birds, particularly vultures. At the time the edifice was constructed, the surrounding country was likely to have been forested and capable of sustaining this variety of wildlife, before millennia of human settlement and cultivation led to the near\u2013[[Dust Bowl]] conditions prevalent today.<ref name=\"Smithsonian\"/> Vultures also feature prominently in the iconography of [[\u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck]] and [[Jericho]].\n\nFew humanoid figures have appeared in the art at G\u00f6bekli Tepe. Some of the T-shaped pillars have human arms carved on their lower half, however, suggesting to site excavator Schmidt that they are intended to represent the bodies of stylized humans (or perhaps deities). Loincloths appear on the lower half of a few pillars. The horizontal stone slab on top is thought by Schmidt to symbolize shoulders, which suggests that the figures were left headless.<ref>Schmidt 2010, pp. 244, 246</ref> Whether they were intended to serve as surrogate worshippers, symbolize venerated ancestors, or represent supernatural, anthropomorphic beings is not known.\n\nSome of the floors in this, the oldest, layer are made of [[terrazzo]] (burnt lime); others are bedrock from which pedestals to hold the large pair of central pillars were carved in high relief.<ref>Schmidt, 2010, p. 251.</ref> Radiocarbon dating places the construction of these early circles in the range of 9600 to 8800 BCE. Carbon dating suggests that (for reasons unknown) the enclosures were backfilled during the Stone Age.\n\n===Layer II===\n[[File:\u015eanl\u0131urfa M\u00fczesi Neotilik \u00c7a\u011f totem.jpg|thumb|upright|A sort of [[totem pole]] from G\u00f6bekli Tepe, with portions of humanoid figures. Layer II, 8800\u20138000 BCE - [[\u015eanl\u0131urfa Museum|\u015eanl\u0131urfa (Urfa) Museum]]]]\n\nCreation of the circular enclosures in layer III later gave way to the construction of small rectangular rooms in layer II. Rectangular buildings make a more efficient use of space compared with circular structures. They often are associated with the emergence of the Neolithic,<ref>Flannery and Marcus, ''The Creation of Inequality'', p. 128</ref> but the T-shaped pillars, the main feature of the older enclosures, also are present here, indicating that the buildings of Layer II continued to serve the same function in the culture, presumably as sanctuaries.<ref>Schmidt 2010, pp. 239, 241.</ref> Layer II is assigned to [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic B]] (PPNB). The several adjoining rectangular, doorless and windowless rooms have floors of polished lime reminiscent of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] terrazzo floors. Carbon dating has yielded dates between 8800 and 8000 BCE.<ref>Schmidt 2009, p. 291</ref> Several T-pillars up to 1.5 meters tall occupy the center of the rooms. A pair decorated with fierce-looking lions is the rationale for the name \"lion pillar building\" by which their enclosure is known.<ref>Schmidt 1990, p. 198</ref>\n\nA stone pillar resembling totem pole designs was discovered at G\u00f6bekli Tepe, Layer II in 2010. It is 1.92 metres high, and is superficially reminiscent of the totem poles in North America. The pole features three figures, the uppermost depicting a predator, probably a bear, and below it a human-like shape. Because the statue is damaged, the interpretation is not entirely clear. Fragments of a similar pole also were discovered about 20 years ago in another Turkey site at [[Neval\u0131 \u00c7ori]]. Also, an older layer at Gobekli features some related sculptures portraying animals on human heads.<ref>[https://tepetelegrams.wordpress.com/2017/03/01/the-gobekli-tepe-totem-pole/ The G\u00f6bekli Tepe \u2018Totem Pole\u2019.] News & Notes from the G\u00f6bekli Tepe Research Staff - 2017-03-01</ref>\n\n===Layer I===\n\n[[File:UrfaMuseumG\u00f6bekli.jpg|thumb|Steles and sculptures from G\u00f6bekli Tepe in [[\u015eanl\u0131urfa Museum]].]]\n\n[[File:G\u00f6bekli2012-27.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of a wild boar, G\u00f6bekli Tepe, 9000 BCE]]\n\nLayer I is the uppermost part of the hill. It is the shallowest, but accounts for the longest stretch of time. It consists of loose sediments caused by erosion and the virtually-uninterrupted use of the hill for agricultural purposes since it ceased to operate as a ceremonial center.\n\nThe site was deliberately [[Earthworks (engineering)|backfilled]] sometime after 8000 BCE: the buildings were buried under debris, mostly flint gravel, stone tools, and animal bones.<ref>Schmidt 2010, p. 242</ref> In addition to [[Byblos]] points (weapon heads, such as arrowheads etc.) and numerous [[Nemrik]] points, [[Helwan]]-points, and [[Tell Aswad|Aswad]]-points dominate the backfill's lithic inventory.\n\n==Chronological context==\nAll statements about the site must be considered preliminary, as less than 5% of the site has been excavated, and Schmidt planned to leave much of it untouched to be explored by future generations when archaeological techniques will presumably have improved.<ref name=\"Smithsonian\"/> While the site formally belongs to the earliest Neolithic ([[Pre-Pottery Neolithic A|PPNA]]), to date no traces of domesticated plants or animals have been found. The inhabitants are presumed to have been [[hunters and gatherers]] who nevertheless lived in villages for at least part of the year.<ref>The Guardian report 23 April 2008</ref> So far, very little evidence for residential use has been found. Through the [[radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon]] method, the end of Layer III can be fixed at about 9000 BCE (see above), but it is hypothesized by some archaeologists{{by whom?|date=June 2018}} that the elevated location may have functioned as a spiritual center during 10,000 BCE or earlier, essentially, at the very end of the [[Pleistocene]].\n\nThe surviving structures, then, not only predate [[pottery]], [[metallurgy]], and the invention of writing or the wheel, but were built before the [[Neolithic Revolution]], that marks the beginning of [[agriculture]] and [[animal husbandry]], around 9000 BCE. The construction of G\u00f6bekli Tepe implies organization of an advanced order not hitherto associated with [[Paleolithic]], [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic A|PPNA]], or [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic B|PPNB]] societies, however. Archaeologists estimate that up to 500 persons were required to extract the heavy pillars from local [[quarry|quarries]] and move them {{convert|100|-|500|m|ft|-1|sp=us}} to the site.<ref>{{cite web| title= Which came first, monumental building projects or farming? |work=Archaeo News |date= 14 December 2008 | url= http://www.stonepages.com/news/archives/003061.html}}</ref> The pillars weigh {{convert|10|-|20|MT|lk=out|0}}, with one still in the quarry weighing 50 tons.<ref>{{cite book|last=Taracha|first=Piotr|title=Religions of second millennium Anatolia|year=2009|publisher=Eisenbrauns|isbn=978-3-447-05885-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xTE7o8aKI7IC&pg=PA12&dq=%22G%C3%B6bekli+Tepe%22+%2250+tons%22#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=12}}</ref>\n\nAround the beginning of the 8th millennium BCE G\u00f6bekli Tepe lost its importance. The advent of agriculture and animal husbandry brought new realities to human life in the area, and the \"Stone-age zoo\" (Schmidt's phrase applied particularly to Layer III, Enclosure D) apparently lost whatever significance it had had for the region's older, foraging communities. However, the complex was not simply abandoned and forgotten to be gradually destroyed by the elements. Instead, each enclosure was deliberately buried under as much as {{convert|300|to|500|m3|cuyd|-1|sp=us}} of refuse, creating a tell consisting mainly of small limestone fragments, stone vessels, and stone tools. Many animal, and even human, bones have been identified in the fill.<ref>Schmidt 2010, pp. 242\u2014243, 249.</ref> Why the enclosures were buried is unknown, but it preserved them for posterity.\n\n==Interpretation==\n[[File:Klaus Schmidt Monumento 2014 5.jpg|thumb|Klaus Schmidt, 2014 in Salzburg]]\nSchmidt's view was that G\u00f6bekli Tepe is a stone-age mountain sanctuary. [[Radiocarbon dating]] as well as comparative, stylistical analysis indicate that it is the oldest known temple yet discovered anywhere.<ref name=\"Smithsonian\"/><ref name=\"ArchMag\">{{cite web | url=http://www.archaeology.org/0811/abstracts/turkey.html| title=The World's First Temple| work= Archaeology magazine |date=Nov\u2013Dec 2008 | page=23}}</ref> Schmidt believed that what he called this \"cathedral on a hill\" was a pilgrimage destination attracting worshippers up to {{convert|150|km|abbr=on|-1}} distant. Butchered bones found in large numbers from local game such as deer, gazelle, pigs, and geese have been identified as refuse from food hunted and cooked or otherwise prepared for the congregants.<ref>Peters & Schmidt 2004, 207</ref>\n\nSchmidt considered G\u00f6bekli Tepe a central location for a [[Veneration of the dead|cult of the dead]] and that the carved animals are there to protect the dead. Though no tombs or graves have yet been found, Schmidt believed that graves remain to be discovered in niches located behind the walls of the sacred circles.<ref name=\"Smithsonian\"/>\n\nIn 2017, discovery of human crania with incisions was reported, interpreted as providing evidence for a new form of Neolithic skull cult.<ref>Julia Gresky, Juliane Haelm and Lee Clare, \"Modified human crania from G\u00f6bekli Tepe provide evidence for a new form of Neolithic skull cult\", ''Science Advances'', Vol. 3, no. 6, 28 Jun 2017. DOI:10.1126/sciadv.1700564 [http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/6/e1700564.full (full text)].</ref>\n\nSchmidt also interpreted the site in connection with the initial stages of the [[Neolithic]].<ref name=\"Smithsonian\" /> It is one of several sites in the vicinity of [[Karaca Da\u011f]], an area that [[genetics|geneticists]] suspect may have been the original source of at least some of our cultivated grains (see [[Einkorn]]). Recent DNA analysis of modern domesticated wheat compared with wild wheat has shown that its DNA is closest in sequence to wild wheat found on [[Karaca Da\u011f]] {{convert|30|km|-1|abbr=on}} away from the site, suggesting that this is where modern wheat was first domesticated.<ref>Heun et al., ''Site of Einkorn Wheat Domestication Identified by DNA Fingerprinting'', Science, 278 (1997) 1312\u201314.</ref>\n\nWith its mountains catching the rain and a calcareous, porous bedrock creating lots of springs, creeks, and rivers,<ref name=\":2\" /> the upper reaches of the Euphrates and Tigris was a refuge during the dry and cold [[Younger Dryas]] climatic event (10,800 \u2013 9,500 BCE){{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}.

He presumed [[shamanism|shamanic]] practices and suggested that the T-shaped pillars represent human forms, perhaps ancestors, whereas he saw a fully articulated belief in deities as not developing until later, in [[Mesopotamia]], that was associated with extensive [[temple]]s and palaces. This corresponds well with an ancient [[Sumer]]ian belief that agriculture, animal husbandry, and weaving were brought to humans from the sacred mountain [[Ekur]], which was inhabited by [[Annuna]] deities, very ancient deities without individual names. Schmidt identified this story as a primeval oriental myth that preserves a partial memory of the emerging Neolithic.<ref>Schmidt 2006, pp. 216\u2013221</ref> It is apparent that the animal and other images give no indication of organized violence, i.e. there are no depictions of hunting raids or wounded animals, and the pillar carvings generally ignore game on which the society depended, such as deer, in favour of formidable creatures such as lions, snakes, spiders, and scorpions.<ref name=\"Smithsonian\" /><ref>Schmidt 2006, pp. 193\u2013194; 218.</ref><ref>Peters & Schmidt 2004, p. 209</ref> Expanding on Schmidt's interpretation that round enclosures could represent sanctuaries, Gheorghiu's semiotic interpretation reads the G\u00f6bekli Tepe iconography as a cosmogonic map that would have related the local community to the surrounding landscape and the cosmos.<ref>Dragos Gheorghiu (2015); ''A river runs through it.

Scholars have been unable to interpret the pictograms, and do not know what meaning the animal reliefs had for visitors to the site; the variety of fauna depicted, from lions and boars to birds and insects, makes any single explanation problematic. As there is little or no evidence of habitation, and many of the animals pictured are predators, the stones may have been intended to [[Apotropaic magic|stave off evils]] through some form of magic representation. Alternatively, they could have served as [[totem]]s.<ref>Peters & Schmidt 2004: pp. 209\u2013212</ref> The assumption that the site was strictly cultic in purpose and not inhabited has been challenged as well by the suggestion that the structures served as large communal houses, \"similar in some ways to the large plank houses of the Northwest Coast of North America with their impressive house posts and totem poles.\"<ref>Banning 2011</ref> It is not known why every few decades the existing pillars were buried to be replaced by new stones as part of a smaller, concentric ring inside the older one.<ref>Mann, June 2011, p. 48</ref> Human burials may have occurred at the site. The reason the complex was carefully backfilled remains unexplained. Based on current evidence, it is difficult to deduce anything certain about the originating culture or the site's significance.\n\n==Conservation==\n[[File:G\u00f6bekli Tepe site (2).JPG|thumb|G\u00f6bekli Tepe]]\nFuture plans include construction of a museum and converting the environs into an archaeological park, in the hope that this will help preserve the site in the state in which it was discovered.<ref>K.

In the north, the plateau is connected to a neighbouring mountain range by a narrow promontory. In all other directions, the ridge descends steeply into slopes and steep cliffs.<ref>Klaus Schmidt: ''Sie bauten die ersten Tempel. Das r\u00e4tselhafte Heiligtum der Steinzeitj\u00e4ger. Die arch\u00e4ologische Entdeckung am G\u00f6bekli Tepe.'' Munich 2006, p. 102.</ref> On top of the ridge there is considerable evidence of human impact, in addition to the construction of the tell. Excavations have taken place at the southern slope of the tell, south and west of a [[mulberry]] that marks an Islamic pilgrimage,<ref>Klaus Schmidt: ''G\u00f6bekli Tepe. Eine Beschreibung der wichtigsten Befunde erstellt nach den Arbeiten der Grabungsteams der Jahre 1995\u20132007''. In: ''Erste Tempel - Fr\u00fche Siedlungen. 12000 Jahre Kunst und Kultur. Ausgrabungen und Forschungen zwischen Donau und Euphrat. Oldenburg 2009, p. 188.</ref> but archaeological finds come from the entire plateau. The team has also found many remains of tools.\n\n===Plateau===\n[[File:G\u00f6bekli Tepe surrounding area.JPG|thumb|left|G\u00f6bekli Tepe surrounding area]]\n[[File:G\u00f6bekli2012-20.jpg|thumb|left|Complex E]]\n[[File:Gobekli Tepe 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Pillar 2 from Enclosure A (Layer III) with [[low relief]]s of what are believed to be a [[bull]], [[fox]], and [[crane (bird)|crane]]]]\n\nThe plateau has been transformed by erosion and by [[quarry]]ing, which took place not only in the Neolithic, but also in classical times. There are four {{convert|10|m|ft|adj=mid|-long}} and {{convert|20|cm|in|adj=mid|-wide}} channels on the southern part of the plateau, interpreted as the remains of an ancient quarry from which rectangular blocks were taken. These possibly are related to a square building in the neighbourhood, of which only the foundation is preserved. Presumably this is the remains of a Roman [[watchtower]] that was part of the [[Limes Arabicus]], however, this is conjecture.<ref name=\"Schmitt 2006, p. 105\">Schmidt 2006, p. 105</ref>\n\nMost structures on the plateau seem to be the result of Neolithic quarrying, with the quarries being used as sources for the huge, monolithic architectural elements. Their profiles were pecked into the rock, with the detached blocks then levered out of the rock bank.<ref name=\"Schmitt 2006, p. 105\"/> Several quarries where round workpieces had been produced were identified. Their status as quarries was confirmed by the find of a 3-by-3&nbsp;metre piece at the southeastern slope of the plateau. Unequivocally Neolithic are three T-shaped pillars that had not yet been levered out of the bedrock. The largest of them lies on the northern plateau. It has a length of {{convert|7|m|0|abbr=on}} and its head has a width of {{convert|3|m|0|abbr=on}}. Its weight may be around 50 tons. The two other unfinished pillars lie on the southern Plateau.\n\n===Tell===\nAt the western edge of the hill, a lionlike figure was found. In this area, [[flint]] and limestone fragments occur more frequently. It was therefore suggested that this could have been some kind of sculpture workshop.<ref>Schmidt 2006, pp. 109\u2013111</ref> It is unclear, on the other hand, how to classify three [[phallus|phallic]] depictions from the surface of the southern plateau. They are near the quarries of classical times, making their dating difficult.<ref name=\"Schmidtp111\">Schmidt 2006, p. 111</ref>\n\nApart from the tell, there is an incised platform with two sockets that could have held pillars, and a surrounding flat bench. This platform corresponds to the complexes from Layer&nbsp;III at the tell. Continuing the naming pattern, it is called \"complex&nbsp;E\". Owing to its similarity to the cult-buildings at [[Neval\u0131 \u00c7ori]] it has also been called \"Temple of the Rock\". Its floor has been carefully hewn out of the bedrock and smoothed, reminiscent of the [[terrazzo]] floors of the younger complexes at G\u00f6bekli Tepe. Immediately northwest of this area are two cistern-like pits that is believed to be part of complex&nbsp;E. One of these pits has a table-high pin as well as a staircase with five steps.<ref>Schmidt 2006, p. 109</ref>\n\nAt the western [[escarpment]], a small cave has been discovered in which a small [[relief]] depicting a [[bovid]] was found. It is the only relief found in this cave.<ref name=\"Schmidtp111\" />\n\n===Layer III===\n{{multiple image\n| align    = right\n| direction =horizontal\n| header=Animal sculpture (ca. 9,000 BC)\n| total_width=400\n| image1   = GobeklitepeHeykel.jpg\n| image2   = Gobeklitepe_animal_sculpture,_circa_9000_BCE.jpg\n| footer=<center>Pillar 27 from Enclosure C (Layer III) with the sculpture of a predatory animal in high relief catching a prey in low relief.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Steadman |first1=Sharon R. |last2=McMahon |first2=Gregory |title=The Oxford Handbook of Ancient Anatolia: (10,000-323 BCE) |date=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press USA |isbn=9780195376142 |page=923 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TY3t4y_L5SQC&pg=PA923 |language=en}}</ref></center>\n}}\n\nAt this early stage of the site's history, circular compounds or ''[[Temenos|temene]]'' first appear. They range from 10 to 30 metres in diameter. Their most notable feature is the presence of T-shaped limestone pillars evenly set within thick interior walls composed of unworked stone. Four such circular structures have been unearthed so far. Geophysical surveys indicate that there are 16 more, enclosing up to eight pillars each, amounting to nearly 200 pillars in all. The slabs were transported from bedrock pits located approximately 100 metres (330&nbsp;ft) from the hilltop, with workers using flint points to cut through the limestone bedrock.<ref>Schmidt 2000b, pp. 52\u201353</ref>\n\n[[File:G\u00f6bekli Tepe Pillar.JPG|thumb|left|Pillar with the sculpture of a fox]]\n[[File:G\u00f6bekli2012-3.jpg|thumb|left|Monolith with possible bird figures.]]\n\nTwo taller pillars stand facing one another at the centre of each circle. Whether the circles were provided with a roof is uncertain. Stone benches designed for sitting are found in the interior.<ref>Mithen 2004, p. 65</ref> Many of the pillars are decorated with [[Abstract art|abstract]], enigmatic [[pictogram]]s and carved animal reliefs. The pictograms may represent commonly understood sacred symbols, as known from [[Neolithic]] [[cave paintings]] elsewhere. The reliefs depict mammals such as lions, bulls, boars, foxes, gazelles, and donkeys; snakes and other reptiles; [[arthropod]]s such as insects and arachnids; and birds, particularly vultures. At the time the edifice was constructed, the surrounding country was likely to have been forested and capable of sustaining this variety of wildlife, before millennia of human settlement and cultivation led to the near\u2013[[Dust Bowl]] conditions prevalent today.<ref name=\"Smithsonian\"/> Vultures also feature prominently in the iconography of [[\u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck]] and [[Jericho]].\n\nFew humanoid figures have appeared in the art at G\u00f6bekli Tepe. Some of the T-shaped pillars have human arms carved on their lower half, however, suggesting to site excavator Schmidt that they are intended to represent the bodies of stylized humans (or perhaps deities). Loincloths appear on the lower half of a few pillars. The horizontal stone slab on top is thought by Schmidt to symbolize shoulders, which suggests that the figures were left headless.<ref>Schmidt 2010, pp. 244, 246</ref> Whether they were intended to serve as surrogate worshippers, symbolize venerated ancestors, or represent supernatural, anthropomorphic beings is not known.\n\nSome of the floors in this, the oldest, layer are made of [[terrazzo]] (burnt lime); others are bedrock from which pedestals to hold the large pair of central pillars were carved in high relief.<ref>Schmidt, 2010, p. 251.</ref> Radiocarbon dating places the construction of these early circles in the range of 9600 to 8800 BCE. Carbon dating suggests that (for reasons unknown) the enclosures were backfilled during the Stone Age.\n\n===Layer II===\n[[File:\u015eanl\u0131urfa M\u00fczesi Neotilik \u00c7a\u011f totem.jpg|thumb|upright|A sort of [[totem pole]] from G\u00f6bekli Tepe, with portions of humanoid figures. Layer II, 8800\u20138000 BCE - [[\u015eanl\u0131urfa Museum|\u015eanl\u0131urfa (Urfa) Museum]]]]\n\nCreation of the circular enclosures in layer III later gave way to the construction of small rectangular rooms in layer II. Rectangular buildings make a more efficient use of space compared with circular structures. They often are associated with the emergence of the Neolithic,<ref>Flannery and Marcus, ''The Creation of Inequality'', p. 128</ref> but the T-shaped pillars, the main feature of the older enclosures, also are present here, indicating that the buildings of Layer II continued to serve the same function in the culture, presumably as sanctuaries.<ref>Schmidt 2010, pp. 239, 241.</ref> Layer II is assigned to [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic B]] (PPNB). The several adjoining rectangular, doorless and windowless rooms have floors of polished lime reminiscent of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] terrazzo floors. Carbon dating has yielded dates between 8800 and 8000 BCE.<ref>Schmidt 2009, p. 291</ref> Several T-pillars up to 1.5 meters tall occupy the center of the rooms. A pair decorated with fierce-looking lions is the rationale for the name \"lion pillar building\" by which their enclosure is known.<ref>Schmidt 1990, p. 198</ref>\n\nA stone pillar resembling totem pole designs was discovered at G\u00f6bekli Tepe, Layer II in 2010. It is 1.92 metres high, and is superficially reminiscent of the totem poles in North America. The pole features three figures, the uppermost depicting a predator, probably a bear, and below it a human-like shape. Because the statue is damaged, the interpretation is not entirely clear. Fragments of a similar pole also were discovered about 20 years ago in another Turkey site at [[Neval\u0131 \u00c7ori]]. Also, an older layer at Gobekli features some related sculptures portraying animals on human heads.<ref>[https://tepetelegrams.wordpress.com/2017/03/01/the-gobekli-tepe-totem-pole/ The G\u00f6bekli Tepe \u2018Totem Pole\u2019.] News & Notes from the G\u00f6bekli Tepe Research Staff - 2017-03-01</ref>\n\n===Layer I===\n\n[[File:UrfaMuseumG\u00f6bekli.jpg|thumb|Steles and sculptures from G\u00f6bekli Tepe in [[\u015eanl\u0131urfa Museum]].]]\n\n[[File:G\u00f6bekli2012-27.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of a wild boar, G\u00f6bekli Tepe, 9000 BCE]]\n\nLayer I is the uppermost part of the hill. It is the shallowest, but accounts for the longest stretch of time. It consists of loose sediments caused by erosion and the virtually-uninterrupted use of the hill for agricultural purposes since it ceased to operate as a ceremonial center.\n\nThe site was deliberately [[Earthworks (engineering)|backfilled]] sometime after 8000 BCE: the buildings were buried under debris, mostly flint gravel, stone tools, and animal bones.<ref>Schmidt 2010, p. 242</ref> In addition to [[Byblos]] points (weapon heads, such as arrowheads etc.) and numerous [[Nemrik]] points, [[Helwan]]-points, and [[Tell Aswad|Aswad]]-points dominate the backfill's lithic inventory.\n\n==Chronological context==\nAll statements about the site must be considered preliminary, as less than 5% of the site has been excavated, and Schmidt planned to leave much of it untouched to be explored by future generations when archaeological techniques will presumably have improved.<ref name=\"Smithsonian\"/> While the site formally belongs to the earliest Neolithic ([[Pre-Pottery Neolithic A|PPNA]]), to date no traces of domesticated plants or animals have been found. The inhabitants are presumed to have been [[hunters and gatherers]] who nevertheless lived in villages for at least part of the year.<ref>The Guardian report 23 April 2008</ref> So far, very little evidence for residential use has been found. Through the [[radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon]] method, the end of Layer III can be fixed at about 9000 BCE (see above), but it is hypothesized by some archaeologists{{by whom?|date=June 2018}} that the elevated location may have functioned as a spiritual center during 10,000 BCE or earlier, essentially, at the very end of the [[Pleistocene]].\n\nThe surviving structures, then, not only predate [[pottery]], [[metallurgy]], and the invention of writing or the wheel, but were built before the [[Neolithic Revolution]], that marks the beginning of [[agriculture]] and [[animal husbandry]], around 9000 BCE. The construction of G\u00f6bekli Tepe implies organization of an advanced order not hitherto associated with [[Paleolithic]], [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic A|PPNA]], or [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic B|PPNB]] societies, however. Archaeologists estimate that up to 500 persons were required to extract the heavy pillars from local [[quarry|quarries]] and move them {{convert|100|-|500|m|ft|-1|sp=us}} to the site.<ref>{{cite web| title= Which came first, monumental building projects or farming? |work=Archaeo News |date= 14 December 2008 | url= http://www.stonepages.com/news/archives/003061.html}}</ref> The pillars weigh {{convert|10|-|20|MT|lk=out|0}}, with one still in the quarry weighing 50 tons.<ref>{{cite book|last=Taracha|first=Piotr|title=Religions of second millennium Anatolia|year=2009|publisher=Eisenbrauns|isbn=978-3-447-05885-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xTE7o8aKI7IC&pg=PA12&dq=%22G%C3%B6bekli+Tepe%22+%2250+tons%22#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=12}}</ref>\n\nAround the beginning of the 8th millennium BCE G\u00f6bekli Tepe lost its importance. The advent of agriculture and animal husbandry brought new realities to human life in the area, and the \"Stone-age zoo\" (Schmidt's phrase applied particularly to Layer III, Enclosure D) apparently lost whatever significance it had had for the region's older, foraging communities. However, the complex was not simply abandoned and forgotten to be gradually destroyed by the elements. Instead, each enclosure was deliberately buried under as much as {{convert|300|to|500|m3|cuyd|-1|sp=us}} of refuse, creating a tell consisting mainly of small limestone fragments, stone vessels, and stone tools. Many animal, and even human, bones have been identified in the fill.<ref>Schmidt 2010, pp. 242\u2014243, 249.</ref> Why the enclosures were buried is unknown, but it preserved them for posterity.\n\n==Interpretation==\n[[File:Klaus Schmidt Monumento 2014 5.jpg|thumb|Klaus Schmidt, 2014 in Salzburg]]\nSchmidt's view was that G\u00f6bekli Tepe is a stone-age mountain sanctuary. [[Radiocarbon dating]] as well as comparative, stylistical analysis indicate that it is the oldest known temple yet discovered anywhere.<ref name=\"Smithsonian\"/><ref name=\"ArchMag\">{{cite web | url=http://www.archaeology.org/0811/abstracts/turkey.html| title=The World's First Temple| work= Archaeology magazine |date=Nov\u2013Dec 2008 | page=23}}</ref> Schmidt believed that what he called this \"cathedral on a hill\" was a pilgrimage destination attracting worshippers up to {{convert|150|km|abbr=on|-1}} distant. Butchered bones found in large numbers from local game such as deer, gazelle, pigs, and geese have been identified as refuse from food hunted and cooked or otherwise prepared for the congregants.<ref>Peters & Schmidt 2004, 207</ref>\n\nSchmidt considered G\u00f6bekli Tepe a central location for a [[Veneration of the dead|cult of the dead]] and that the carved animals are there to protect the dead. Though no tombs or graves have yet been found, Schmidt believed that graves remain to be discovered in niches located behind the walls of the sacred circles.<ref name=\"Smithsonian\"/>\n\nIn 2017, discovery of human crania with incisions was reported, interpreted as providing evidence for a new form of Neolithic skull cult.<ref>Julia Gresky, Juliane Haelm and Lee Clare, \"Modified human crania from G\u00f6bekli Tepe provide evidence for a new form of Neolithic skull cult\", ''Science Advances'', Vol. 3, no. 6, 28 Jun 2017. DOI:10.1126/sciadv.1700564 [http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/6/e1700564.full (full text)].</ref>\n\nSchmidt also interpreted the site in connection with the initial stages of the [[Neolithic]].<ref name=\"Smithsonian\" /> It is one of several sites in the vicinity of [[Karaca Da\u011f]], an area that [[genetics|geneticists]] suspect may have been the original source of at least some of our cultivated grains (see [[Einkorn]]). Recent DNA analysis of modern domesticated wheat compared with wild wheat has shown that its DNA is closest in sequence to wild wheat found on [[Karaca Da\u011f]] {{convert|30|km|-1|abbr=on}} away from the site, suggesting that this is where modern wheat was first domesticated.<ref>Heun et al., ''Site of Einkorn Wheat Domestication Identified by DNA Fingerprinting'', Science, 278 (1997) 1312\u201314.</ref>\n\nWith its mountains catching the rain and a calcareous, porous bedrock creating lots of springs, creeks, and rivers,<ref name=\":2\" /> the upper reaches of the Euphrates and Tigris was a refuge during the dry and cold [[Younger Dryas]] climatic event (10,800 \u2013 9,500 BCE){{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}. Speculation exists that conditions driven by population expansions locally could have led them to develop common rituals strengthened by monumental gathering places to reduce tensions and conflicts over resources,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tepetelegrams.wordpress.com/2017/06/01/cooperative-action-of-hunter-gatherers-in-the-early-neolithic-near-east-a-view-from-goebekli-tepe/|title=Cooperative Action of Hunter-Gatherers in the Early Neolithic Near East. A View from G\u00f6bekli Tepe|last=Oliver|first=Dietrich|date=June 1, 2017|website=|access-date=}}</ref> and probably, to mark territorial claims.\n\nSchmidt also engaged in speculation regarding the belief systems of the groups that created G\u00f6bekli Tepe, based on comparisons with other shrines and settlements. He presumed [[shamanism|shamanic]] practices and suggested that the T-shaped pillars represent human forms, perhaps ancestors, whereas he saw a fully articulated belief in deities as not developing until later, in [[Mesopotamia]], that was associated with extensive [[temple]]s and palaces. This corresponds well with an ancient [[Sumer]]ian belief that agriculture, animal husbandry, and weaving were brought to humans from the sacred mountain [[Ekur]], which was inhabited by [[Annuna]] deities, very ancient deities without individual names. Schmidt identified this story as a primeval oriental myth that preserves a partial memory of the emerging Neolithic.<ref>Schmidt 2006, pp. 216\u2013221</ref> It is apparent that the animal and other images give no indication of organized violence, i.e. there are no depictions of hunting raids or wounded animals, and the pillar carvings generally ignore game on which the society depended, such as deer, in favour of formidable creatures such as lions, snakes, spiders, and scorpions.<ref name=\"Smithsonian\" /><ref>Schmidt 2006, pp. 193\u2013194; 218.</ref><ref>Peters & Schmidt 2004, p. 209</ref> Expanding on Schmidt's interpretation that round enclosures could represent sanctuaries, Gheorghiu's semiotic interpretation reads the G\u00f6bekli Tepe iconography as a cosmogonic map that would have related the local community to the surrounding landscape and the cosmos.<ref>Dragos Gheorghiu (2015); ''A river runs through it.

Some researchers believe that the construction of G\u00f6bekli Tepe may have contributed to the later development of urban civilization, or, as excavator Klaus Schmidt put it, \"First came the temple, then the city.\"<ref>K. Schmidt 2000: \"Zuerst kam der Tempel, dann die Stadt.\"</ref>\n[[File:T-shaped-pillars-PPN.jpg|thumb|Sites with T-shaped pillars from the PPN]]\nIn addition to its large dimensions, the side-by-side existence of multiple pillar shrines makes the location unique.

It was excavated by the [[German Archaeological Institute]] and has been submerged by the [[Atat\u00fcrk Dam]] since 1992. Its T-shaped pillars are considerably smaller, and its rectangular ceremonial structure was located inside a village. The roughly contemporary architecture at [[Jericho]] is devoid of artistic merit or large-scale sculpture, and [[\u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck]], perhaps the most famous Anatolian Neolithic village, is 2,000 years later.\n\nAt present G\u00f6bekli Tepe appears to raise more questions for archaeology and prehistory than it answers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}} It remains unknown how a population large enough to construct, augment, and maintain such a substantial complex was mobilized and compensated or fed in the conditions of pre-sedentary society. Scholars have been unable to interpret the pictograms, and do not know what meaning the animal reliefs had for visitors to the site; the variety of fauna depicted, from lions and boars to birds and insects, makes any single explanation problematic. As there is little or no evidence of habitation, and many of the animals pictured are predators, the stones may have been intended to [[Apotropaic magic|stave off evils]] through some form of magic representation. Alternatively, they could have served as [[totem]]s.<ref>Peters & Schmidt 2004: pp. 209\u2013212</ref> The assumption that the site was strictly cultic in purpose and not inhabited has been challenged as well by the suggestion that the structures served as large communal houses, \"similar in some ways to the large plank houses of the Northwest Coast of North America with their impressive house posts and totem poles.\"<ref>Banning 2011</ref> It is not known why every few decades the existing pillars were buried to be replaced by new stones as part of a smaller, concentric ring inside the older one.<ref>Mann, June 2011, p. 48</ref> Human burials may have occurred at the site.

{"title_page": "Continuous game", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=March 2009}}\nA '''continuous game''' is a mathematical concept, used in [[game theory]], that generalizes the idea of an ordinary game like tic-tac-toe (noughts and crosses) or checkers (draughts). In other words, it extends the notion of a discrete game, where the players choose from a finite set of pure strategies. The continuous game concepts allows games to include more general sets of pure strategies, which may be [[uncountable|uncountably infinite]]. \n\nIn general, a game with uncountably infinite strategy sets will not necessarily have a [[Nash equilibrium]] solution. If, however, the strategy sets are required to be [[compact space|compact]] and the utility functions [[continuous function|continuous]], then a Nash equilibrium will be guaranteed; this is by Glicksberg's generalization of the [[Kakutani fixed point theorem]]. The class of continuous games is for this reason usually defined and studied as a subset of the larger class of infinite games (i.e. games with infinite strategy sets) in which the strategy sets are compact and the utility functions continuous.\n\n==Formal definition==\nDefine the ''n''-player continuous game <math> G = (P, \\mathbf{C}, \\mathbf{U}) </math> where\n\n::<math>P = {1, 2, 3,\\ldots, n}</math> is the set of <math>n\\, </math>  players,\n:: <math>\\mathbf{C}=  (C_1, C_2, \\ldots, C_n) </math> where each <math>C_i\\, </math> is a [[compact space|compact]] [[metric space|set, in a metric space,]] corresponding to the <math>i\\, </math> ''th'' player's set of pure strategies,\n:: <math>\\mathbf{U}=  (u_1, u_2, \\ldots, u_n) </math> where <math>u_i:\\mathbf{C}\\to \\R</math> is the utility function of player <math>i\\, </math>\n: We define <math>\\Delta_i\\, </math> to be the set of Borel [[probability measure]]s on <math>C_i\\, </math>, giving us the mixed strategy space of player ''i''.\n: Define the strategy profile <math>\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2, \\ldots, \\sigma_n)</math> where <math>\\sigma_i \\in \\Delta_i\\, </math>\nLet <math>\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{-i}</math> be a strategy profile of all players except for player <math>i</math>.  As with discrete games, we can define a [[best response]] [[1:1 correspondence|correspondence]] for player <math>i\\, </math>, <math>b_i\\ </math>.  <math>b_i\\, </math> is a relation from the set of all probability distributions over opponent player profiles to a set of player <math>i</math>'s strategies, such that each element of\n\n:<math>b_i(\\sigma_{-i})\\, </math>\nis a best response to <math>\\sigma_{-i}</math>.  Define\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{b}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) = b_1(\\sigma_{-1}) \\times b_2(\\sigma_{-2}) \\times \\cdots \\times b_n(\\sigma_{-n})</math>.\nA strategy profile <math>\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}*</math> is a [[Nash equilibrium]] if and only if\n<math>\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}* \\in \\mathbf{b}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}*)</math>\nThe existence of a Nash equilibrium for any continuous game with continuous utility functions can be proven using  [[Irving Glicksberg]]'s generalization of the [[Kakutani fixed point theorem]].<ref>I.L. Glicksberg. A further generalization of the Kakutani fixed point theorem, with application to Nash equilibrium points.

Denote elements of <math>C_X\\, </math> and <math>C_Y\\, </math> as <math>x\\, </math> and <math>y\\, </math> respectively.  Define the utility functions <math>H(x,y) = u_x(x,y) = -u_y(x,y)\\, </math> where\n\n:<math>H(x,y)=(x-y)^2\\, </math>.\n\nThe pure strategy best response relations are:\n\n:<math>b_X(y) =\n\\begin{cases}\n  1,  & \\mbox{if  }y \\in \\left [0,1/2 \\right ) \\\\\n  0\\text{ or }1, & \\mbox{if }y = 1/2 \\\\\n  0, & \\mbox{if  } y \\in \\left (1/2,1 \\right ]\n\n\\end{cases}</math>\n\n:<math>b_Y(x) = x\\, </math>\n\n<math>b_X(y)\\, </math>  and  <math>b_Y(x)\\, </math>  do not intersect, so there is\n\nno pure strategy Nash equilibrium.\nHowever, there should be a mixed strategy equilibrium.  To find it, express the expected value, <math> v = \\mathbb{E} [H(x,y)]</math> as a [[linear]] combination of the first and second [[moment (mathematics)|moments]] of the probability distributions of '''X''' and '''Y''':\n\n: <math> v = \\mu_{X2} - 2\\mu_{X1} \\mu_{Y1} + \\mu_{Y2}\\, </math>\n\n(where <math>\\mu_{XN} = \\mathbb{E} [x^N]</math> and similarly for ''Y'').\n\nThe constraints on <math>\\mu_{X1}\\, </math> and <math>\\mu_{X2}</math> (with similar constraints for ''y'',) are given by [[Hausdorff moment problem|Hausdorff]] as:\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\mu_{X1} \\ge \\mu_{X2} \\\\\n\\mu_{X1}^2 \\le \\mu_{X2}\n\\end{align}\n\\qquad\n\\begin{align}\n\\mu_{Y1} \\ge \\mu_{Y2} \\\\\n\\mu_{Y1}^2 \\le \\mu_{Y2}\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nEach pair of constraints defines a compact convex subset in the plane.  Since <math>v\\, </math> is linear, any extrema with respect to a player's first two moments will lie on the boundary of this subset.  Player i's equilibrium strategy will lie on\n\n: <math>\\mu_{i1} = \\mu_{i2} \\text{ or } \\mu_{i1}^2 = \\mu_{i2} </math>\n\nNote that the first equation only permits mixtures of 0 and 1 whereas the second equation only permits pure strategies.  Moreover, if the best response at a certain point to player i lies on <math>\\mu_{i1} = \\mu_{i2}\\, </math>, it will lie on the whole line, so that both 0 and 1 are a best response.  <math>b_Y(\\mu_{X1},\\mu_{X2})\\, </math> simply gives the pure strategy <math>y = \\mu_{X1}\\, </math>, so <math>b_Y\\, </math> will never give both 0 and 1.\nHowever <math>b_x\\, </math> gives both 0 and 1 when y = 1/2.\nA Nash equilibrium exists when:\n\n: <math> (\\mu_{X1}*, \\mu_{X2}*, \\mu_{Y1}*, \\mu_{Y2}*) = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2, 1/4)\\, </math>\n\nThis determines one unique equilibrium where Player X plays a random mixture of 0 for 1/2 of the time and 1 the other 1/2 of the time.  Player Y plays the pure strategy of 1/2.  The value of the game is 1/4.\n\n===Non-Separable Games===\n====A rational pay-off function====\nConsider a zero-sum 2-player game between players '''X''' and '''Y''', with <math>C_X = C_Y = \\left [0,1 \\right ] </math>.

In other words, it extends the notion of a discrete game, where the players choose from a finite set of pure strategies. The continuous game concepts allows games to include more general sets of pure strategies, which may be [[uncountable|uncountably infinite]]. \n\nIn general, a game with uncountably infinite strategy sets will not necessarily have a [[Nash equilibrium]] solution. If, however, the strategy sets are required to be [[compact space|compact]] and the utility functions [[continuous function|continuous]], then a Nash equilibrium will be guaranteed; this is by Glicksberg's generalization of the [[Kakutani fixed point theorem]]. The class of continuous games is for this reason usually defined and studied as a subset of the larger class of infinite games (i.e. games with infinite strategy sets) in which the strategy sets are compact and the utility functions continuous.\n\n==Formal definition==\nDefine the ''n''-player continuous game <math> G = (P, \\mathbf{C}, \\mathbf{U}) </math> where\n:: <math>P = {1, 2, 3,\\ldots, n}</math> is the set of <math>n\\, </math>  players,\n:: <math>\\mathbf{C}=  (C_1, C_2, \\ldots, C_n) </math> where each <math>C_i\\, </math> is a [[compact space|compact]] [[metric space]] corresponding to the <math>i\\, </math> ''th'' player's set of pure strategies,\n:: <math>\\mathbf{U}=  (u_1, u_2, \\ldots, u_n) </math> where <math>u_i:\\mathbf{C}\\to \\R</math> is the utility function of player <math>i\\, </math>\n: We define <math>\\Delta_i\\, </math> to be the set of Borel [[probability measure]]s on <math>C_i\\, </math>, giving us the mixed strategy space of player ''i''.\n: Define the strategy profile <math>\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2, \\ldots, \\sigma_n)</math> where <math>\\sigma_i \\in \\Delta_i\\, </math>\nLet <math>\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{-i}</math> be a strategy profile of all players except for player <math>i</math>.  As with discrete games, we can define a [[best response]] [[1:1 correspondence|correspondence]] for player <math>i\\, </math>, <math>b_i\\ </math>.  <math>b_i\\, </math> is a relation from the set of all probability distributions over opponent player profiles to a set of player <math>i</math>'s strategies, such that each element of\n\n:<math>b_i(\\sigma_{-i})\\, </math>\nis a best response to <math>\\sigma_{-i}</math>.  Define\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{b}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) = b_1(\\sigma_{-1}) \\times b_2(\\sigma_{-2}) \\times \\cdots \\times b_n(\\sigma_{-n})</math>.\nA strategy profile <math>\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}*</math> is a [[Nash equilibrium]] if and only if\n<math>\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}* \\in \\mathbf{b}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}*)</math>\nThe existence of a Nash equilibrium for any continuous game with continuous utility functions can be proven using  [[Irving Glicksberg]]'s generalization of the [[Kakutani fixed point theorem]].<ref>I.L. Glicksberg. A further generalization of the Kakutani fixed point theorem, with application to Nash equilibrium points.

Stein, A. Ozdaglar and P.A. Parrilo. \"Separable and Low-Rank Continuous Games\". ''International Journal of Game Theory'', 37(4):475\u2013504, December 2008. https://arxiv.org/abs/0707.3462</ref>\nWhereas an equilibrium strategy for a non-separable game may require an [[uncountable set|uncountably infinite]] [[Support (mathematics)|support]], a separable game is guaranteed to have at least one Nash equilibrium with finitely supported mixed strategies.\n\n==Examples==\n===Separable games===\n====A polynomial game====\nConsider a zero-sum 2-player game between players '''X''' and '''Y''', with <math>C_X = C_Y = \\left [0,1 \\right ] </math>.  Denote elements of <math>C_X\\, </math> and <math>C_Y\\, </math> as <math>x\\, </math> and <math>y\\, </math> respectively.  Define the utility functions <math>H(x,y) = u_x(x,y) = -u_y(x,y)\\, </math> where\n\n:<math>H(x,y)=(x-y)^2\\, </math>.\n\nThe pure strategy best response relations are:\n\n:<math>b_X(y) =\n\\begin{cases}\n  1,  & \\mbox{if  }y \\in \\left [0,1/2 \\right ) \\\\\n  0\\text{ or }1, & \\mbox{if }y = 1/2 \\\\\n  0, & \\mbox{if  } y \\in \\left (1/2,1 \\right ]\n\n\\end{cases}</math>\n\n:<math>b_Y(x) = x\\, </math>\n\n<math>b_X(y)\\, </math>  and  <math>b_Y(x)\\, </math>  do not intersect, so there is\n\nno pure strategy Nash equilibrium.\nHowever, there should be a mixed strategy equilibrium.  To find it, express the expected value, <math> v = \\mathbb{E} [H(x,y)]</math> as a [[linear]] combination of the first and second [[moment (mathematics)|moments]] of the probability distributions of '''X''' and '''Y''':\n\n: <math> v = \\mu_{X2} - 2\\mu_{X1} \\mu_{Y1} + \\mu_{Y2}\\, </math>\n\n(where <math>\\mu_{XN} = \\mathbb{E} [x^N]</math> and similarly for ''Y'').\n\nThe constraints on <math>\\mu_{X1}\\, </math> and <math>\\mu_{X2}</math> (with similar constraints for ''y'',) are given by [[Hausdorff moment problem|Hausdorff]] as:\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\mu_{X1} \\ge \\mu_{X2} \\\\\n\\mu_{X1}^2 \\le \\mu_{X2}\n\\end{align}\n\\qquad\n\\begin{align}\n\\mu_{Y1} \\ge \\mu_{Y2} \\\\\n\\mu_{Y1}^2 \\le \\mu_{Y2}\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nEach pair of constraints defines a compact convex subset in the plane.  Since <math>v\\, </math> is linear, any extrema with respect to a player's first two moments will lie on the boundary of this subset.  Player i's equilibrium strategy will lie on\n\n: <math>\\mu_{i1} = \\mu_{i2} \\text{ or } \\mu_{i1}^2 = \\mu_{i2} </math>\n\nNote that the first equation only permits mixtures of 0 and 1 whereas the second equation only permits pure strategies.  Moreover, if the best response at a certain point to player i lies on <math>\\mu_{i1} = \\mu_{i2}\\, </math>, it will lie on the whole line, so that both 0 and 1 are a best response.  <math>b_Y(\\mu_{X1},\\mu_{X2})\\, </math> simply gives the pure strategy <math>y = \\mu_{X1}\\, </math>, so <math>b_Y\\, </math> will never give both 0 and 1.\nHowever <math>b_x\\, </math> gives both 0 and 1 when y = 1/2.\nA Nash equilibrium exists when:\n\n: <math> (\\mu_{X1}*, \\mu_{X2}*, \\mu_{Y1}*, \\mu_{Y2}*) = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2, 1/4)\\, </math>\n\nThis determines one unique equilibrium where Player X plays a random mixture of 0 for 1/2 of the time and 1 the other 1/2 of the time.  Player Y plays the pure strategy of 1/2.  The value of the game is 1/4.\n\n===Non-Separable Games===\n====A rational pay-off function====\nConsider a zero-sum 2-player game between players '''X''' and '''Y''', with <math>C_X = C_Y = \\left [0,1 \\right ] </math>.

She was cast as Jan Brady on ''The Brady Bunch'' in 1969, and portrayed the role until the series' end in 1974. After, Plumb continued to work in television, portraying a teenage prostitute in the [[NBC]] television film ''[[Dawn: Portrait of a Teenage Runaway]]'' (1976), and as Elizabeth March in the 1978 miniseries ''[[Little Women (1978 film)|Little Women]]''.\n\nPlumb continued to reprise her role as Jan Brady on numerous reunion series and films, including ''[[The Brady Brides]]'' (1981) and ''[[A Very Brady Christmas]]'' (1988). She made her feature film debut with a minor role in ''[[I'm Gonna Git You Sucka]]'' (1988), and later appeared in [[Gregg Araki]]'s black comedy ''[[Nowhere (film)|Nowhere]]'' (1997). In 2010, Plumb made her New York stage debut in ''Miss Abigail's Guide to Dating, Mating and Marriage'', followed by stage productions of [[Nora Ephron]]'s ''[[Love, Loss, and What I Wore]]'', and ''[[Same Time, Next Year (play)|Same Time, Next Year]]''.

The following year, she appeared on ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'', ''[[The Big Valley]]'' and ''[[Lassie (1954 TV series)|Lassie]]''. (She was also cast as \"Bonnie Braids\" in a [[Dick Tracy#Live-action television pilot|TV pilot]] version of the comic strip [[Dick Tracy]], but does not actually appear in the program itself, only in the opening credits.) In 1968, she appeared on ''[[It Takes a Thief (1968 TV series)|It Takes a Thief]]'' and ''[[Family Affair]]''; in the latter, she played a terminally ill girl on the episode \"Christmas Came A Little Early\". In 1969, she appeared on an episode of ''[[Gunsmoke]]''.\n\nFrom 1969 to 1974, Plumb appeared as middle sister Jan Brady in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sitcom ''[[The Brady Bunch]]''. Her featured storylines included Jan's embarrassment over not having a boyfriend, concerns about her future appearance, being a middle child, and her insecurity over wearing glasses. Several episodes centered on Jan's jealousy of older sister [[Marcia Brady|Marcia]], resulting in the famous \"Marcia, Marcia, Marcia!\" line that has arguably become the quintessential quote of the series. Plumb also supplied the voice of Jan in the ABC Saturday morning cartoon ''[[The Brady Kids]]'' from 1972 to 1973. After ''The Brady Bunch'' was canceled in 1974, it went on to even greater success in syndicated reruns. The sitcom has never left the television airwaves and eventually spawned numerous [[Spin-off (media)|spin-offs]], reunion specials, feature films, and parodies.\n\nSeveral episodes of the sitcom featured the Brady kids singing and as a result, Plumb and the rest of the younger cast recorded several albums. Plumb would also provide a monologue for the [[Patrick Williams (composer)|Pat Williams]] Orchestra's 1974 recording of \"California Love Story\". The single was co-produced by Plumb's recording executive father, Neely Plumb.\n\n===1975\u20132000: Other projects and ''Brady Bunch'' reunions===\n[[File:Dawn Portrait of a Teenage Runaway Eve Plumb 1976.jpg|thumb|upright=.9|left|Plumb as the title character in ''[[Dawn: Portrait of a Teenage Runaway]]'', 1976]]\nAfter ''The Brady Bunch'' ended, Plumb's first notable role was that of a teenage prostitute in the NBC television movie ''[[Dawn: Portrait of a Teenage Runaway]]'' (1976). She also appeared in the sequel ''[[Alexander: The Other Side of Dawn]]'' (1977). Plumb starred as \"Beth\" in [[NBC]] productions of ''[[Little Women (1978 film)|Little Women]]'' (1978), both a television movie and a short-lived series. Plumb also made numerous guest-starring appearances in such series as ''[[Here's Lucy]]'', ''[[The Love Boat]]'', ''[[Fantasy Island]]'', ''[[Wonder Woman (TV series)|Wonder Woman]]'', ''[[One Day at a Time (1975 TV series)|One Day at a Time]]'', ''[[The Facts of Life (TV series)|The Facts of Life]]'', ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'', ''[[The Super Mario Bros.

Much was made of her absence, including accusations that she no longer wanted to be associated with the Bradys. Plumb has stated in interviews that she was willing to do the variety show's original special episode, but could not commit to a five-year option for additional shows. Her role would be filled by [[Geri Reischl]], who went on to be known among ''Brady Bunch'' fans as \"fake Jan\". The show lasted for only nine episodes.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nPlumb returned to the \"Jan\" role for the NBC TV movie ''[[The Brady Bunch#The Brady Girls Get Married / The Brady Brides|The Brady Girls Get Married]]'' (1981), which led to ''[[The Brady Bunch#The Brady Girls Get Married / The Brady Brides|The Brady Brides]]'', a short-lived sitcom in which she co-starred with [[Maureen McCormick]], who played Marcia Brady. She also appeared in the CBS television movie ''[[A Very Brady Christmas]]'' (1988) and its 1990 spin-off [[comedy-drama|dramedy]] series, ''[[The Bradys]]''.

Dither is routinely used in processing of both [[digital audio]] and [[digital video|video]] data, and is often one of the last stages of [[Audio mastering|mastering]] audio to a [[compact disc|CD]].\n\nA common use of dither is converting a [[greyscale]] image to black and white, such that the density of black dots in the new image approximates the average grey level in the original.\n\n== Etymology ==\n\n{{quote\n|\u2026[O]ne of the earliest [applications] of dither came in World War II. Airplane bombers used [[mechanical computers]] to perform navigation and bomb trajectory calculations. Curiously, these computers (boxes filled with hundreds of gears and cogs) performed more accurately when flying on board the aircraft, and less well on ground. Engineers realized that the vibration from the aircraft reduced the error from sticky moving parts. Instead of moving in short jerks, they moved more continuously. Small vibrating motors were built into the computers, and their vibration was called dither from the Middle English verb \"didderen,\" meaning \"to tremble.\" Today, when you tap a mechanical meter to increase its accuracy, you are applying dither, and modern dictionaries define dither as a highly nervous, confused, or agitated state. In minute quantities, dither successfully makes a digitization system a little more analog in the good sense of the word.\n|Ken Pohlmann, ''Principles of Digital Audio''<ref>{{cite book | title = Principles of Digital Audio | author = Ken C.

If that error is ''[[correlation|correlated]]'' to the signal, the result is potentially cyclical or predictable.

This process is called [[Quantization (sound processing)|quantization]]. Each coded value is a discrete step... if a signal is quantized without using dither, there will be quantization distortion related to the original input signal... In order to prevent this, the signal is \"dithered\", a process that mathematically removes the harmonics or other highly undesirable distortions entirely, and that replaces it with a constant, fixed noise level.<ref>Mastering Audio: The Art and the Science by [[Bob Katz]], pages 49\u201350, {{ISBN|978-0-240-80545-0}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe final version of audio that goes onto a [[compact disc]] contains only 16 bits per sample, but throughout the production process, a greater number of bits are typically used to represent the sample. In the end, the digital data must be reduced to 16 bits for pressing onto a CD and distributing.\n\nThere are multiple ways to do this. One can, for example, simply discard the excess bits \u2013 called ''truncation.'' One can also ''round'' the excess bits to the nearest value. Each of these methods, however, results in predictable and determinable errors in the result. Using dither replaces these errors with a constant, fixed noise level.\n\n=== Examples ===\n[[Image:Reducing amplitude resolution plot.png|frame]]\n{{listen\n| header = 6-bit truncation example audio samples\n| filename = 16bit sine.ogg\n| title = 16-bit sine wave\n| description =\n| format = [[Ogg]]\n| filename2 = 6bit sine truncated.ogg\n| title2 = truncated to 6 bits\n| description2 =\n| format2 = [[Ogg]]\n| filename3 =\n| title3 = dithered to 6 bits\n| description3 =\n| format3 = [[Ogg]]\n}}\n\nTake, for example, a [[waveform]] that consists of the following values:\n\n  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n\nIf the waveform is reduced by 20%, then the following are the new values:\n\n  0.8 1.6 2.4 3.2 4.0 4.8 5.6 6.4\n\nIf these values are truncated it results in the following data:\n\n  0 1 2 3 4 4 5 6\n\nIf these values are rounded instead it results in the following data:\n\n  1 2 2 3 4 5 6 6\n\nFor any original waveform, the process of reducing the waveform amplitude by 20% results in regular errors. Take for example a sine wave that, for some portion, matches the values above. Every time the sine wave's value hit 3.2, the truncated result would be off by 0.2, as in the sample data above. Every time the sine wave's value hit 4.0, there would be no error since the truncated result would be off by 0.0, also shown above. The magnitude of this error changes regularly and repeatedly throughout the sine wave's cycle. It is precisely this error which manifests itself as [[distortion]]. What the ear hears as distortion is the additional content at discrete frequencies created by the regular and repeated quantization error.\n\nA plausible solution would be to take the 2 digit number (say, 4.8) and round it one direction or the other. For example, it could be rounded to 5 one time and then 4 the next time. This would make the long-term average 4.5 instead of 4, so that over the long-term the value is closer to its actual value. This, on the other hand, still results in determinable (though more complicated) error. Every other time the value 4.8 comes up the result is an error of 0.2, and the other times it is \u22120.8. This still results in a repeating, quantifiable error.\n\nAnother plausible solution would be to take 4.8 and round it so that the first four times out of five it is rounded up to 5, and the fifth time it is rounded to 4. This would average out to exactly 4.8 over the long term. Unfortunately, however, it still results in repeatable and determinable errors, and those errors still manifest themselves as distortion to the ear.\n\nThis leads to the ''dither'' solution. Rather than predictably rounding up or down in a repeating pattern, it is possible to round up or down in a random pattern. If a series of random numbers between 0.0 and 0.9 (ex: 0.6, 0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, etc.) are calculated and added to the results of the equation, two times out of ten the result will truncate back to 4 (if 0.0 or 0.1 are added to 4.8) and eight times out of ten it will truncate to 5. Each given situation has a random 20% chance of rounding to 4 or 80% chance of rounding to 5. Over the long haul this will result in results that average to 4.8 and a quantization error that is random noise. This noise result is less offensive to the ear than the determinable distortion that would result otherwise.\n\n=== Usage ===\nDither is added before any quantization or re-quantization process, in order to de-correlate the quantization noise from the input signal and to prevent non-linear behavior (distortion). Quantization with lesser bit depth requires higher amounts of dither. The result of the process still yields distortion, but the distortion is of a random nature so the resulting noise is, effectively, de-correlated from the intended signal.\n\nIn a seminal papers published in the [[AES Journal]], Lipshitz and Vanderkooy pointed out that different noise types, with different [[probability density function]]s (PDFs) behave differently when used as dither signals,<ref name=vanderkooy87/> and suggested optimal levels of dither signal for audio. [[Gaussian noise]] requires a higher level of added noise for full elimination of distortion than noise with [[rectangular distribution|rectangular]] or [[triangular distribution]]. Triangular distributed noise also minimizes ''noise modulation''{{snd}}audible changes in the volume level of residual noise behind quiet music that draw attention to the noise.<ref name=lipshitzy91/>\n\nDither can be useful to break up periodic [[limit cycle]]s, which are a common problem in digital filters. Random noise is typically less objectionable than the harmonic tones produced by limit cycles.\n\n=== Different types ===\nRectangular probability density function (RPDF) dither noise has a [[Uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform distribution]]; any value in the specified range has the same [[probability]] of occurring.\n\nTriangular probability density function (TPDF) dither noise has a [[triangular distribution]]; values in the center of the range have a higher probability of occurring. Triangular distribution can be achieved by adding two independent RPDF sources.\n\nGaussian PDF has a [[normal distribution]]. The relationship of probabilities of results follows a bell-shaped, or [[Gaussian curve]], typical of dither generated by analog sources such as microphone preamplifiers. If the bit depth of a recording is sufficiently great, that [[preamplifier]] noise will be sufficient to dither the recording.\n\n[[Noise shaping]] is a filtering process that shapes the spectral energy of quantization error, typically to either de-emphasize frequencies to which the ear is most sensitive or separate the signal and noise bands completely. If dither is used, its final spectrum depends on whether it is added inside or outside the feedback loop of the noise shaper. If inside, the dither is treated as part of the error signal and shaped along with actual quantization error. If outside, the dither is treated as part of the original signal and linearises quantization without being shaped itself. In this case, the final noise floor is the sum of the flat dither spectrum and the shaped quantization noise. While real-world noise shaping usually includes in-loop dithering, it is also possible to use it without adding dither at all, in which case quantization error is evident at low signal levels.\n\nColored dither is sometimes mentioned as dither that has been filtered to be different from [[white noise]]. Noise shaping is one such application.\n\n==== Which types to use ====\nIf the signal being dithered is to undergo further processing, then it should be processed with a triangular-type dither that has an amplitude of two quantization steps so that the dither values computed range from, for example, \u22121 to +1, or 0 to 2.<ref name=vanderkooy87/> This is the lowest power ideal dither, in that it does not introduce noise modulation (which would manifest as a constant noise floor), and completely eliminates the harmonic distortion from quantization. If a ''colored'' dither is used instead at these intermediate processing stages, then frequency content may \"[[bleed (audio)|bleed]]\" into other frequency ranges that are more noticeable and become distractingly audible.\n\nIf the signal being dithered is to undergo no further processing \u2014 if it is being dithered to its final result for distribution \u2014 then a \"colored\" dither or noise shaping is appropriate. This can effectively lower the audible noise level, by putting most of that noise in a frequency range where it is less critical.<!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]-->\n\n== Digital photography and image processing ==\n[[Image:Dithering example red blue.svg|frame|left|An illustration of dithering. Red and blue are the only colors used but, as the red and blue squares are made smaller, the patch appears purple.]]\n\n[[Image:256colortestthing.png|thumb|right|256 color dithering with [[IrfanView]]]]\n'''Dithering''' is used in [[computer graphics]] to create the illusion of \"[[color]] depth\" in images with a limited [[palette (computing)|color palette]] - a technique also known as [[color quantization]]. In a dithered image, colors that are not available in the palette are approximated by a diffusion of colored [[pixel]]s from within the available palette. The human eye perceives the diffusion as a mixture of the colors within it (see [[color vision]]).  Dithered images, particularly those with relatively few colors, can often be distinguished by a characteristic graininess or speckled appearance.\n\nBy its nature, dithering introduces pattern into an image - the theory being that the image will be viewed from such a distance that the pattern is not discernible to the human eye.  Unfortunately this is not always the case, and often the patterning is visible - for example, with some images found on the web.  In these circumstances it has been shown that a [[Blue noise|blue-noise]] dither pattern is the least unsightly and distracting.<ref name=dithernoise>{{cite web\n|url = http://home.comcast.net/~ulichney/CV/papers/1994-freq-characterization.pdf\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140214164527/http://home.comcast.net/~ulichney/CV/papers/1993-void-cluster.pdf\n|archivedate=2014-02-14\n|url-status=live\n|title = Halftone Characterization in the Frequency Domain\n|accessdate = 2013-08-12\n|last = Ulichney\n|first = Robert A\n|year = 1994\n}}{{dl|date=March 2020}}</ref>  The error diffusion techniques were some of the first methods to generate blue-noise dithering patterns. However, other techniques such as [[ordered dithering]] can also generate blue-noise dithering without the tendency to degenerate into areas with artifacts.\n\n=== Examples ===\n[[Image:Color dithering on a towel.jpg|thumb|Color dithering on a towel]]\nReducing the color depth of an image can have significant visual side-effects. If the original image is a photograph, it is likely to have thousands, or even millions of distinct colors. The process of constraining the available colors to a specific ''color palette'' effectively throws away a certain amount of color information.\n\nA number of factors can affect the resulting quality of a color-reduced image. Perhaps most significant is the color palette that will be used in the reduced image. For example, an original image (''Figure 1'') may be reduced to the 216-color \"[[web-safe]]\" color palette. If the original pixel colors are simply translated into the closest available color from the palette, no dithering will occur (''Figure 2''). However, typically this approach will result in flat areas (contours) and a loss of detail, and may produce patches of color that are significantly different from the original. Shaded or gradient areas may appear as ''color bands'', which may be distracting. The application of dithering can help to minimize such visual artifacts, and usually results in a better representation of the original (''Figure 3''). Dithering helps to reduce [[color banding]] and flatness.\n\nOne of the problems associated with using a fixed color palette is that many of the needed colors may not be available in the palette, and many of the available colors may not be needed; a fixed palette containing mostly shades of green would not be well-suited for images that do not contain many shades of green, for instance. The use of an optimized color palette can be of benefit in such cases. An optimized color palette is one in which the available colors are chosen based on how frequently they are used in the original source image. If the image is reduced based on an optimized palette the result is often much closer to the original (''Figure 4'').\n\nThe number of colors available in the palette is also a contributing factor. If, for example, the palette is limited to only 16 colors then the resulting image could suffer from additional loss of detail, resulting in even more pronounced problems with flatness and color banding (''Figure 5''). Once again, dithering can help to minimize such artifacts (''Figure 6'').\n\n{{Gallery\n| lines = 6\n| width = 260\n|File:Dithering example undithered.png|Figure 1.

Here, the original has been reduced to a 256-color optimized palette with [[Floyd\u2013Steinberg dithering]] applied.

This image also uses the 16-color optimized palette, but the use of dithering helps to reduce banding.\n}}\n\n=== Applications ===\nMany different kinds of display hardware, including early computer [[graphics card|video adapters]] as well as many modern [[liquid crystal display|LCDs]] used in [[mobile phone]]s and inexpensive [[digital camera]]s, show a much smaller color range than more advanced displays. One common application of dithering is to more accurately display graphics containing a greater range of colors than the hardware is capable of showing. For example, dithering might be used in order to display a photographic image containing [[24-bit color|millions of colors]] on video hardware that is only capable of showing 256 colors at a time. The 256 available colors would be used to generate a dithered approximation of the original image. Without dithering, the colors in the original image might simply be \"rounded off\" to the closest available color, resulting in a new image that is a poor representation of the original. Dithering takes advantage of the human eye's tendency to \"mix\" two colors in close proximity to one another.\n\nSome LCDs may use [[temporal dithering]] to achieve a similar effect. By alternating each pixel's color value rapidly between two approximate colors in the panel's color space (also known as [[Frame Rate Control]]), a display panel which natively supports only 18-bit color (6 bits per channel) can represent a 24-bit \"true\" color image (8 bits per channel).<ref>{{cite web|title=6-Bit vs. 8-Bit... PVA/MVA vs. TN+Film \u2014 Are Things Changing?|website=TFT Central|url=http://www.tftcentral.co.uk/articles/6bit_8bit.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410205222/http://www.tftcentral.co.uk/articles/6bit_8bit.htm|archive-date=2008-04-10|access-date=2008-02-06}}</ref>\n\nDithering such as this, in which the computer's display hardware is the primary limitation on [[color depth]], is commonly employed in software such as [[web browser]]s. Since a web browser may be retrieving graphical elements from an external source, it may be necessary for the browser to perform dithering on images with too many colors for the available display. It was due to problems with dithering that a color palette known as the \"[[Web-safe color|web-safe color palette]]\" was identified, for use in choosing colors that would not be dithered on displays with only 256 colors available.\n\nBut even when the total number of available colors in the display hardware is high enough to \"properly\" render full color digital photographs (such as those using 15- and 16-bit RGB [[Highcolor|Hicolor]] 32,768/65,536 color modes), banding may still be evident to the eye, especially in large areas of smooth shade transitions (although the original image file has no banding at all). Dithering the 32 or 64 RGB levels will result in a pretty good \"pseudo [[24-bit color|truecolor]]\" display approximation, which the eye will not resolve as ''grainy''. Furthermore, images displayed on 24-bit RGB hardware (8 bits per RGB primary) can be dithered to simulate somewhat higher bit depth, and/or to minimize the loss of hues available after a [[gamma correction]]. High-end still image processing software commonly uses these techniques for improved display.\n\nAnother useful application of dithering is for situations in which the [[graphics file format|graphic file format]] is the limiting factor. In particular, the commonly used [[GIF]] format is restricted to the use of 256 or fewer colors in many graphics editing programs. Images in other file formats, such as [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], may also have such a restriction imposed on them for the sake of a reduction in file size. Images such as these have a fixed color palette defining all the colors that the image may use. For such situations, [[bitmap graphics editor|graphical editing software]] may be responsible for dithering images prior to saving them in such restrictive formats.\n\nDithering is analogous to the [[halftone]] technique used in [[printing]].  The recent widespread adoption of [[inkjet printer]]s and their ability to print isolated dots has increased the use of dithering in printing.  For this reason the term ''dithering'' is sometimes used interchangeably with the term ''halftoning'', particularly in association with [[digital printing]].\n\nA typical desktop inkjet printer can print just 16 colors (the combination of dot or no dot from cyan, magenta, yellow and black print heads). Some of these ink combinations are not useful though, because when the black ink is used it typically obscures any of the other colors.  To reproduce a large range of colors, dithering is used.  In densely printed areas, where the color is dark the dithering is not always visible because the dots of ink merge producing a more uniform print.  However, a close inspection of the light areas of a print where the dithering has placed dots much further apart reveals the tell-tale dots of dithering.\n\n=== Algorithms ===\nThere are several [[algorithm]]s designed to perform dithering. One of the earliest, and still one of the most popular, is the [[Floyd\u2013Steinberg dithering]] algorithm, which was developed in 1975. One of the strengths of this algorithm is that it minimizes visual artifacts through an [[Error diffusion|error-diffusion]] process; error-diffusion algorithms typically produce images that more closely represent the original than simpler dithering algorithms.<ref name=dhalf>{{cite web\n|url = http://www.efg2.com/Lab/Library/ImageProcessing/DHALF.TXT\n|title = Digital Halftoning\n|accessdate = 2007-09-10\n|last = Crocker\n|first = Lee Daniel\n|authorlink = Lee Daniel Crocker\n|author2 = Boulay, Paul\n|author3 = Morra, Mike\n|date = 20 June 1991\n|work = Computer Lab and Reference Library\n|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927122512/http://www.efg2.com/Lab/Library/ImageProcessing/DHALF.TXT\n|archive-date = 27 September 2007\n|url-status = dead\n}} ''Note: this article contains a minor mistake: \u201c(To fully reproduce our 256-level image, we would need to use an''\n'''8x8''' ''pattern.)\u201d The bold part should read \u201c16x16\u201d.''</ref>\n\nDithering methods include:\n* ''Thresholding'' (also average dithering<ref>{{cite web\n|url = http://www.visgraf.impa.br/Courses/ip00/proj/Dithering1/\n|title = Average Dithering\n|accessdate = 2007-09-10\n|last = Silva\n|first = Arist\u00f3fanes Correia |author2=Lucena, Paula Salgado |author3=Figuerola, Wilfredo Blanco\n|date = 13 December 2000\n|work = Image Based Artistic Dithering\n|publisher = Visgraf Lab\n}}</ref>): each pixel value is compared against a fixed threshold. This may be the simplest dithering algorithm there is, but it results in immense loss of detail and contouring.<ref name=dhalf />\n* ''Random dithering'' was the first attempt (at least as early as 1951) to remedy the drawbacks of thresholding. Each pixel value is compared against a random threshold, resulting in a staticky image. Although this method doesn't generate patterned artifacts, the noise tends to swamp the detail of the image. It is analogous to the practice of [[mezzotint]]ing.<ref name=dhalf />\n* ''Patterning'' dithers using a fixed pattern.  For each of the input values a fixed pattern is placed in the output image.  The biggest disadvantage of this technique is that the output image is larger (by a factor of the fixed pattern size) than the input pattern.<ref name=dhalf />\n* ''[[Ordered dithering]]'' dithers using a \"dither matrix\".  For every pixel in the image the value of the pattern at the corresponding location is used as a threshold. Neighboring pixels do not affect each other, making this form of dithering suitable for use in animations. Different patterns can generate completely different dithering effects.  Though simple to implement, this dithering algorithm is not easily changed to work with free-form, arbitrary palettes.\n** A ''[[halftone]] dithering'' matrix produces a look similar to that of halftone screening in newspapers. This is a form of clustered dithering, in that dots tend to cluster together. This can help hide the adverse effects of blurry pixels found on some older output devices.  The primary use for this method is in [[offset printing]] and [[laser printer]]s. In both these devices the ink or toner prefers to clump together and will not form the isolated dots generated by the other dithering methods. \n** A ''Bayer matrix''<ref name=dhalf /> produces a very distinctive cross-hatch pattern.\n** A matrix tuned for ''[[blue noise]]'', such as those generated by the \"void-and-cluster\" method,<ref name=voidcluster>{{cite web\n|url = http://cv.ulichney.com/papers/1993-void-cluster.pdf\n|title = The void-and-cluster method for dither array generation\n|accessdate = 2014-02-11\n|last = Ulichney\n|first = Robert A\n|year = 1993\n}}</ref> produces a look closer to that of an error diffusion dither method.  \n{|\n|-\n!(Original)\n!Threshold\n!Random\n|-\n|[[Image:Michelangelo's David - 63 grijswaarden.png]]\n|[[Image:Michelangelo's David - drempel.png]]\n|[[Image:Michelangelo's David - ruis.png]]\n|-\n!Halftone\n!Ordered (Bayer)\n!Ordered (void-and-cluster)\n|-\n|[[Image:Michelangelo's David - halftoon.png]]\n|[[Image:Michelangelo's David - Bayer.png]]\n|[[File:Michelangelo's David - Void-and-Cluster.png]]\n|}\n* ''[[Error diffusion|Error-diffusion]] dithering'' is a feedback process that diffuses the quantization error to neighboring pixels.\n**[[Floyd\u2013Steinberg dithering|Floyd\u2013Steinberg (FS) dithering]] only diffuses the error to neighboring pixels. This results in very fine-grained dithering.\n**[[Minimized average error dithering]] by Jarvis, Judice, and Ninke diffuses the error also to pixels one step further away. The dithering is coarser, but has fewer visual artifacts. However, it is slower than Floyd\u2013Steinberg dithering, because it distributes errors among 12 nearby pixels instead of 4 nearby pixels for Floyd\u2013Steinberg.\n**[[Stucki dithering]] is based on the above, but is slightly faster.

Three of Hitler's siblings\u2014Gustav, Ida, and Otto\u2014died in infancy.[16] Also living in the household were Alois's children from his second marriage: Alois Jr. (born 1882) and Angela (born 1883).[17] When Hitler was three, the family moved to Passau, Germany.[18] There he acquired the distinctive lower Bavarian dialect, rather than Austrian German, which marked his speech throughout his life.[19][20][21] The family returned to Austria and settled in Leonding in 1894, and in June 1895 Alois retired to Hafeld, near Lambach, where he farmed and kept bees. Hitler attended Volksschule (a state-owned primary school) in nearby Fischlham.[\n\n==In digital processing and waveform analysis==\nDither is utilized in many different fields where digital processing and analysis are used. These uses include systems using [[digital signal processing]], such as [[digital audio]], [[digital video]], [[digital photography]], [[seismology]], [[radar]] and [[weather forecasting]] systems.\n\n[[Quantization (signal processing)|Quantization]] yields error. If that error is ''[[correlation|correlated]]'' to the signal, the result is potentially cyclical or predictable.

This process is called [[Quantization (sound processing)|quantization]]. Each coded value is a discrete step... if a signal is quantized without using dither, there will be quantization distortion related to the original input signal... In order to prevent this, the signal is \"dithered\", a process that mathematically removes the harmonics or other highly undesirable distortions entirely, and that replaces it with a constant, fixed noise level.<ref>Mastering Audio: The Art and the Science by [[Bob Katz]], pages 49\u201350, {{ISBN|978-0-240-80545-0}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe final version of audio that goes onto a [[compact disc]] contains only 16 bits per sample, but throughout the production process, a greater number of bits are typically used to represent the sample. In the end, the digital data must be reduced to 16 bits for pressing onto a CD and distributing.\n\nThere are multiple ways to do this. One can, for example, simply discard the excess bits \u2013 called ''truncation.'' One can also ''round'' the excess bits to the nearest value. Each of these methods, however, results in predictable and determinable errors in the result. Using dither replaces these errors with a constant, fixed noise level.\n\n=== Examples ===\n[[Image:Reducing amplitude resolution plot.png|frame]]\n{{listen\n| header = 6-bit truncation example audio samples\n| filename = 16bit sine.ogg\n| title = 16-bit sine wave\n| description =\n| format = [[Ogg]]\n| filename2 = 6bit sine truncated.ogg\n| title2 = truncated to 6 bits\n| description2 =\n| format2 = [[Ogg]]\n| filename3 =\n| title3 = dithered to 6 bits\n| description3 =\n| format3 = [[Ogg]]\n}}\n\nTake, for example, a [[waveform]] that consists of the following values:\n\n  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n\nIf the waveform is reduced by 20%, then the following are the new values:\n\n  0.8 1.6 2.4 3.2 4.0 4.8 5.6 6.4\n\nIf these values are truncated it results in the following data:\n\n  0 1 2 3 4 4 5 6\n\nIf these values are rounded instead it results in the following data:\n\n  1 2 2 3 4 5 6 6\n\nFor any original waveform, the process of reducing the waveform amplitude by 20% results in regular errors. Take for example a sine wave that, for some portion, matches the values above. Every time the sine wave's value hit 3.2, the truncated result would be off by 0.2, as in the sample data above. Every time the sine wave's value hit 4.0, there would be no error since the truncated result would be off by 0.0, also shown above. The magnitude of this error changes regularly and repeatedly throughout the sine wave's cycle. It is precisely this error which manifests itself as [[distortion]]. What the ear hears as distortion is the additional content at discrete frequencies created by the regular and repeated quantization error.\n\nA plausible solution would be to take the 2 digit number (say, 4.8) and round it one direction or the other. For example, it could be rounded to 5 one time and then 4 the next time. This would make the long-term average 4.5 instead of 4, so that over the long-term the value is closer to its actual value. This, on the other hand, still results in determinable (though more complicated) error. Every other time the value 4.8 comes up the result is an error of 0.2, and the other times it is \u22120.8. This still results in a repeating, quantifiable error.\n\nAnother plausible solution would be to take 4.8 and round it so that the first four times out of five it is rounded up to 5, and the fifth time it is rounded to 4. This would average out to exactly 4.8 over the long term. Unfortunately, however, it still results in repeatable and determinable errors, and those errors still manifest themselves as distortion to the ear.\n\nThis leads to the ''dither'' solution. Rather than predictably rounding up or down in a repeating pattern, it is possible to round up or down in a random pattern. If a series of random numbers between 0.0 and 0.9 (ex: 0.6, 0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, etc.) are calculated and added to the results of the equation, two times out of ten the result will truncate back to 4 (if 0.0 or 0.1 are added to 4.8) and eight times out of ten it will truncate to 5. Each given situation has a random 20% chance of rounding to 4 or 80% chance of rounding to 5. Over the long haul this will result in results that average to 4.8 and a quantization error that is random noise. This noise result is less offensive to the ear than the determinable distortion that would result otherwise.\n\n=== Usage ===\nDither is added before any quantization or re-quantization process, in order to de-correlate the quantization noise from the input signal and to prevent non-linear behavior (distortion). Quantization with lesser bit depth requires higher amounts of dither. The result of the process still yields distortion, but the distortion is of a random nature so the resulting noise is, effectively, de-correlated from the intended signal.\n\nIn a seminal papers published in the [[AES Journal]], Lipshitz and Vanderkooy pointed out that different noise types, with different [[probability density function]]s (PDFs) behave differently when used as dither signals,<ref name=vanderkooy87/> and suggested optimal levels of dither signal for audio. [[Gaussian noise]] requires a higher level of added noise for full elimination of distortion than noise with [[rectangular distribution|rectangular]] or [[triangular distribution]]. Triangular distributed noise also minimizes ''noise modulation''{{snd}}audible changes in the volume level of residual noise behind quiet music that draw attention to the noise.<ref name=lipshitzy91/>\n\nDither can be useful to break up periodic [[limit cycle]]s, which are a common problem in digital filters. Random noise is typically less objectionable than the harmonic tones produced by limit cycles.\n\n=== Different types ===\nRectangular probability density function (RPDF) dither noise has a [[Uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform distribution]]; any value in the specified range has the same [[probability]] of occurring.\n\nTriangular probability density function (TPDF) dither noise has a [[triangular distribution]]; values in the center of the range have a higher probability of occurring. Triangular distribution can be achieved by adding two independent RPDF sources.\n\nGaussian PDF has a [[normal distribution]]. The relationship of probabilities of results follows a bell-shaped, or [[Gaussian curve]], typical of dither generated by analog sources such as microphone preamplifiers. If the bit depth of a recording is sufficiently great, that [[preamplifier]] noise will be sufficient to dither the recording.\n\n[[Noise shaping]] is a filtering process that shapes the spectral energy of quantization error, typically to either de-emphasize frequencies to which the ear is most sensitive or separate the signal and noise bands completely. If dither is used, its final spectrum depends on whether it is added inside or outside the feedback loop of the noise shaper. If inside, the dither is treated as part of the error signal and shaped along with actual quantization error. If outside, the dither is treated as part of the original signal and linearises quantization without being shaped itself. In this case, the final noise floor is the sum of the flat dither spectrum and the shaped quantization noise. While real-world noise shaping usually includes in-loop dithering, it is also possible to use it without adding dither at all, in which case quantization error is evident at low signal levels.\n\nColored dither is sometimes mentioned as dither that has been filtered to be different from [[white noise]]. Noise shaping is one such application.\n\n==== Which types to use ====\nIf the signal being dithered is to undergo further processing, then it should be processed with a triangular-type dither that has an amplitude of two quantization steps so that the dither values computed range from, for example, \u22121 to +1, or 0 to 2.<ref name=vanderkooy87/> This is the lowest power ideal dither, in that it does not introduce noise modulation (which would manifest as a constant noise floor), and completely eliminates the harmonic distortion from quantization. If a ''colored'' dither is used instead at these intermediate processing stages, then frequency content may \"[[bleed (audio)|bleed]]\" into other frequency ranges that are more noticeable and become distractingly audible.\n\nIf the signal being dithered is to undergo no further processing \u2014 if it is being dithered to its final result for distribution \u2014 then a \"colored\" dither or noise shaping is appropriate. This can effectively lower the audible noise level, by putting most of that noise in a frequency range where it is less critical.<!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]-->\n\n== Digital photography and image processing ==\n[[Image:Dithering example red blue.svg|frame|left|An illustration of dithering. Red and blue are the only colors used but, as the red and blue squares are made smaller, the patch appears purple.]]\n\n[[Image:256colortestthing.png|thumb|right|256 color dithering with [[IrfanView]]]]\n'''Dithering''' is used in [[computer graphics]] to create the illusion of \"[[color]] depth\" in images with a limited [[palette (computing)|color palette]] - a technique also known as [[color quantization]]. In a dithered image, colors that are not available in the palette are approximated by a diffusion of colored [[pixel]]s from within the available palette. The human eye perceives the diffusion as a mixture of the colors within it (see [[color vision]]).  Dithered images, particularly those with relatively few colors, can often be distinguished by a characteristic graininess or speckled appearance.\n\nBy its nature, dithering introduces pattern into an image - the theory being that the image will be viewed from such a distance that the pattern is not discernible to the human eye.  Unfortunately this is not always the case, and often the patterning is visible - for example, with some images found on the web.  In these circumstances it has been shown that a [[Blue noise|blue-noise]] dither pattern is the least unsightly and distracting.<ref name=dithernoise>{{cite web\n|url = http://home.comcast.net/~ulichney/CV/papers/1994-freq-characterization.pdf\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140214164527/http://home.comcast.net/~ulichney/CV/papers/1993-void-cluster.pdf\n|archivedate=2014-02-14\n|url-status=live\n|title = Halftone Characterization in the Frequency Domain\n|accessdate = 2013-08-12\n|last = Ulichney\n|first = Robert A\n|year = 1994\n}}{{dl|date=March 2020}}</ref>  The error diffusion techniques were some of the first methods to generate blue-noise dithering patterns. However, other techniques such as [[ordered dithering]] can also generate blue-noise dithering without the tendency to degenerate into areas with artifacts.\n\n=== Examples ===\n[[Image:Color dithering on a towel.jpg|thumb|Color dithering on a towel]]\nReducing the color depth of an image can have significant visual side-effects. If the original image is a photograph, it is likely to have thousands, or even millions of distinct colors. The process of constraining the available colors to a specific ''color palette'' effectively throws away a certain amount of color information.\n\nA number of factors can affect the resulting quality of a color-reduced image. Perhaps most significant is the color palette that will be used in the reduced image. For example, an original image (''Figure 1'') may be reduced to the 216-color \"[[web-safe]]\" color palette. If the original pixel colors are simply translated into the closest available color from the palette, no dithering will occur (''Figure 2''). However, typically this approach will result in flat areas (contours) and a loss of detail, and may produce patches of color that are significantly different from the original. Shaded or gradient areas may appear as ''color bands'', which may be distracting. The application of dithering can help to minimize such visual artifacts, and usually results in a better representation of the original (''Figure 3''). Dithering helps to reduce [[color banding]] and flatness.\n\nOne of the problems associated with using a fixed color palette is that many of the needed colors may not be available in the palette, and many of the available colors may not be needed; a fixed palette containing mostly shades of green would not be well-suited for images that do not contain many shades of green, for instance. The use of an optimized color palette can be of benefit in such cases. An optimized color palette is one in which the available colors are chosen based on how frequently they are used in the original source image. If the image is reduced based on an optimized palette the result is often much closer to the original (''Figure 4'').\n\nThe number of colors available in the palette is also a contributing factor. If, for example, the palette is limited to only 16 colors then the resulting image could suffer from additional loss of detail, resulting in even more pronounced problems with flatness and color banding (''Figure 5''). Once again, dithering can help to minimize such artifacts (''Figure 6'').\n\n{{Gallery\n| lines = 6\n| width = 260\n|File:Dithering example undithered.png|Figure 1.

Here, the original has been reduced to a 256-color optimized palette with [[Floyd\u2013Steinberg dithering]] applied.

This image also uses the 16-color optimized palette, but the use of dithering helps to reduce banding.\n}}\n\n=== Applications ===\nMany different kinds of display hardware, including early computer [[graphics card|video adapters]] as well as many modern [[liquid crystal display|LCDs]] used in [[mobile phone]]s and inexpensive [[digital camera]]s, show a much smaller color range than more advanced displays. One common application of dithering is to more accurately display graphics containing a greater range of colors than the hardware is capable of showing. For example, dithering might be used in order to display a photographic image containing [[24-bit color|millions of colors]] on video hardware that is only capable of showing 256 colors at a time. The 256 available colors would be used to generate a dithered approximation of the original image. Without dithering, the colors in the original image might simply be \"rounded off\" to the closest available color, resulting in a new image that is a poor representation of the original. Dithering takes advantage of the human eye's tendency to \"mix\" two colors in close proximity to one another.\n\nSome LCDs may use [[temporal dithering]] to achieve a similar effect. By alternating each pixel's color value rapidly between two approximate colors in the panel's color space (also known as [[Frame Rate Control]]), a display panel which natively supports only 18-bit color (6 bits per channel) can represent a 24-bit \"true\" color image (8 bits per channel).<ref>{{cite web|title=6-Bit vs. 8-Bit... PVA/MVA vs. TN+Film \u2014 Are Things Changing?|website=TFT Central|url=http://www.tftcentral.co.uk/articles/6bit_8bit.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410205222/http://www.tftcentral.co.uk/articles/6bit_8bit.htm|archive-date=2008-04-10|access-date=2008-02-06}}</ref>\n\nDithering such as this, in which the computer's display hardware is the primary limitation on [[color depth]], is commonly employed in software such as [[web browser]]s. Since a web browser may be retrieving graphical elements from an external source, it may be necessary for the browser to perform dithering on images with too many colors for the available display. It was due to problems with dithering that a color palette known as the \"[[Web-safe color|web-safe color palette]]\" was identified, for use in choosing colors that would not be dithered on displays with only 256 colors available.\n\nBut even when the total number of available colors in the display hardware is high enough to \"properly\" render full color digital photographs (such as those using 15- and 16-bit RGB [[Highcolor|Hicolor]] 32,768/65,536 color modes), banding may still be evident to the eye, especially in large areas of smooth shade transitions (although the original image file has no banding at all). Dithering the 32 or 64 RGB levels will result in a pretty good \"pseudo [[24-bit color|truecolor]]\" display approximation, which the eye will not resolve as ''grainy''. Furthermore, images displayed on 24-bit RGB hardware (8 bits per RGB primary) can be dithered to simulate somewhat higher bit depth, and/or to minimize the loss of hues available after a [[gamma correction]]. High-end still image processing software commonly uses these techniques for improved display.\n\nAnother useful application of dithering is for situations in which the [[graphics file format|graphic file format]] is the limiting factor. In particular, the commonly used [[GIF]] format is restricted to the use of 256 or fewer colors in many graphics editing programs. Images in other file formats, such as [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], may also have such a restriction imposed on them for the sake of a reduction in file size. Images such as these have a fixed color palette defining all the colors that the image may use. For such situations, [[bitmap graphics editor|graphical editing software]] may be responsible for dithering images prior to saving them in such restrictive formats.\n\nDithering is analogous to the [[halftone]] technique used in [[printing]].  The recent widespread adoption of [[inkjet printer]]s and their ability to print isolated dots has increased the use of dithering in printing.  For this reason the term ''dithering'' is sometimes used interchangeably with the term ''halftoning'', particularly in association with [[digital printing]].\n\nA typical desktop inkjet printer can print just 16 colors (the combination of dot or no dot from cyan, magenta, yellow and black print heads). Some of these ink combinations are not useful though, because when the black ink is used it typically obscures any of the other colors.  To reproduce a large range of colors, dithering is used.  In densely printed areas, where the color is dark the dithering is not always visible because the dots of ink merge producing a more uniform print.  However, a close inspection of the light areas of a print where the dithering has placed dots much further apart reveals the tell-tale dots of dithering.\n\n=== Algorithms ===\nThere are several [[algorithm]]s designed to perform dithering. One of the earliest, and still one of the most popular, is the [[Floyd\u2013Steinberg dithering]] algorithm, which was developed in 1975. One of the strengths of this algorithm is that it minimizes visual artifacts through an [[Error diffusion|error-diffusion]] process; error-diffusion algorithms typically produce images that more closely represent the original than simpler dithering algorithms.<ref name=dhalf>{{cite web\n|url = http://www.efg2.com/Lab/Library/ImageProcessing/DHALF.TXT\n|title = Digital Halftoning\n|accessdate = 2007-09-10\n|last = Crocker\n|first = Lee Daniel\n|authorlink = Lee Daniel Crocker\n|author2 = Boulay, Paul\n|author3 = Morra, Mike\n|date = 20 June 1991\n|work = Computer Lab and Reference Library\n|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927122512/http://www.efg2.com/Lab/Library/ImageProcessing/DHALF.TXT\n|archive-date = 27 September 2007\n|url-status = dead\n}} ''Note: this article contains a minor mistake: \u201c(To fully reproduce our 256-level image, we would need to use an''\n'''8x8''' ''pattern.)\u201d The bold part should read \u201c16x16\u201d.''</ref>\n\nDithering methods include:\n* ''Thresholding'' (also average dithering<ref>{{cite web\n|url = http://www.visgraf.impa.br/Courses/ip00/proj/Dithering1/\n|title = Average Dithering\n|accessdate = 2007-09-10\n|last = Silva\n|first = Arist\u00f3fanes Correia |author2=Lucena, Paula Salgado |author3=Figuerola, Wilfredo Blanco\n|date = 13 December 2000\n|work = Image Based Artistic Dithering\n|publisher = Visgraf Lab\n}}</ref>): each pixel value is compared against a fixed threshold. This may be the simplest dithering algorithm there is, but it results in immense loss of detail and contouring.<ref name=dhalf />\n* ''Random dithering'' was the first attempt (at least as early as 1951) to remedy the drawbacks of thresholding. Each pixel value is compared against a random threshold, resulting in a staticky image. Although this method doesn't generate patterned artifacts, the noise tends to swamp the detail of the image. It is analogous to the practice of [[mezzotint]]ing.<ref name=dhalf />\n* ''Patterning'' dithers using a fixed pattern.  For each of the input values a fixed pattern is placed in the output image.  The biggest disadvantage of this technique is that the output image is larger (by a factor of the fixed pattern size) than the input pattern.<ref name=dhalf />\n* ''[[Ordered dithering]]'' dithers using a \"dither matrix\".  For every pixel in the image the value of the pattern at the corresponding location is used as a threshold. Neighboring pixels do not affect each other, making this form of dithering suitable for use in animations. Different patterns can generate completely different dithering effects.  Though simple to implement, this dithering algorithm is not easily changed to work with free-form, arbitrary palettes.\n** A ''[[halftone]] dithering'' matrix produces a look similar to that of halftone screening in newspapers. This is a form of clustered dithering, in that dots tend to cluster together. This can help hide the adverse effects of blurry pixels found on some older output devices.  The primary use for this method is in [[offset printing]] and [[laser printer]]s. In both these devices the ink or toner prefers to clump together and will not form the isolated dots generated by the other dithering methods. \n** A ''Bayer matrix''<ref name=dhalf /> produces a very distinctive cross-hatch pattern.\n** A matrix tuned for ''[[blue noise]]'', such as those generated by the \"void-and-cluster\" method,<ref name=voidcluster>{{cite web\n|url = http://cv.ulichney.com/papers/1993-void-cluster.pdf\n|title = The void-and-cluster method for dither array generation\n|accessdate = 2014-02-11\n|last = Ulichney\n|first = Robert A\n|year = 1993\n}}</ref> produces a look closer to that of an error diffusion dither method.  \n{|\n|-\n!(Original)\n!Threshold\n!Random\n|-\n|[[Image:Michelangelo's David - 63 grijswaarden.png]]\n|[[Image:Michelangelo's David - drempel.png]]\n|[[Image:Michelangelo's David - ruis.png]]\n|-\n!Halftone\n!Ordered (Bayer)\n!Ordered (void-and-cluster)\n|-\n|[[Image:Michelangelo's David - halftoon.png]]\n|[[Image:Michelangelo's David - Bayer.png]]\n|[[File:Michelangelo's David - Void-and-Cluster.png]]\n|}\n* ''[[Error diffusion|Error-diffusion]] dithering'' is a feedback process that diffuses the quantization error to neighboring pixels.\n**[[Floyd\u2013Steinberg dithering|Floyd\u2013Steinberg (FS) dithering]] only diffuses the error to neighboring pixels. This results in very fine-grained dithering.\n**[[Minimized average error dithering]] by Jarvis, Judice, and Ninke diffuses the error also to pixels one step further away.
