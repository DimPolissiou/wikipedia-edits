Her maternal grandparents were [[William Cavendish (courtier)|Sir William Cavendish]] and his wife [[Bess of Hardwick|Elizabeth]], better known as \"Bess of Hardwick\".\n\nIn her final days as a prisoner in the [[Tower of London]], Arbella Seymour (her married name), refusing to eat, fell ill, and died on 25 September 1615. She was buried in [[Westminster Abbey]] on 29 September 1615. In the 19th century, during a search for the tomb of James VI and I, Arbella's lead coffin was found in the vault of Mary, Queen of Scots, placed directly on top of that of the Scots queen.<ref>{{cite book|last=Stanley|first=A.

It seems she enjoyed periodic visits to the [[Court (royal)|court]] and to London, including court visits during the summers of 1587 and 1588 and one that lasted from November 1591 to July 1592.<ref>David N.

She also notes he had hoped for an annuity of \u00a340 a year ({{Inflation|GBP|40|1589|r=-2|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}) from Arbella based on the fact that he had \"been so much damnified [i.e. that much out of pocket] by leaving the University\". This has led to speculation that Morley was the poet [[Christopher Marlowe]],<ref>Charles Nicholl, ''The Reckoning: The Murder of Christopher Marlowe'', 1992, pp.340\u2013342</ref> whose name was sometimes spelled that way.\n\n== Heiress to the English throne==\n{{details|Succession to Elizabeth I of England}}\nFor some time before 1592, Arbella was considered one of the natural candidates to succeed her first cousin twice removed, Queen Elizabeth I.<ref>Marshall, p.601</ref> However, between the end of 1592 and the spring of 1593, the influential Cecils \u2013 Elizabeth's Lord Treasurer, Lord Burghley, and his son, Secretary of State [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Sir Robert Cecil]] \u2013 turned their attention away from Arbella towards her cousin [[James VI of Scotland]], regarding him as a preferable successor.<ref>Handover, ''The Second Cecil'', 55-6; 297; Read, ''Lord Burghley'', 484</ref>\n\nSometimes she was invited to Elizabeth's court, but much of her time she spent away living with her grandmother.

When she was invited to participate by agreeing in writing to [[Philip III of Spain]], however, she immediately reported the invitation to the king.<ref>Gristwood, pp. 267\u2013269</ref>\n\n==Marriage negotiations==\nOwing to Arbella's status as a possible heir to the throne, there were discussions of appropriate marriages for her throughout her childhood. \n\nIn 1588, it was proposed to James VI of Scotland that [[Ludovic Stuart, 2nd Duke of Lennox]], should be married to Arbella, but nothing seems to have come of this suggestion either.<ref>Gristwood, p.109</ref> James VI was interested in this match but the Countess of Lennox's servant [[Thomas Fowler (courtier)|Thomas Fowler]] discouraged him.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 17.</ref> Other potential matches were the sons of  [[Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma]], who could claim the English throne as descendants of [[John of Gaunt]]. The idea was to secure toleration for English Catholics or even win Arbella for the Catholic faith. However, the eldest son, [[Ranuccio I Farnese, Duke of Parma|Ranuccio]], was already married, and the younger son, [[Odoardo Farnese (cardinal)|Odoardo]], was a Cardinal. The Pope was reportedly prepared to absolve Odoardo from his obligations but the resistance of Queen Elizabeth I to such a marriage stopped the plan probably even before Arbella could be approached.<ref name=AS /> \n\nIn the closing months of Elizabeth's reign, Arbella fell into trouble through reports that she intended to marry Edward Seymour, a member of the prominent Seymour family. This was reported to the Queen by the supposed groom's grandfather, [[Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford]]. Arbella denied having any intention of marrying without the Queen's permission. In 1604, [[Sigismund III Vasa]], [[List of Polish monarchs|King of Poland]], sent an ambassador to England to ask for Arbella to be his wife. This offer was rejected.<ref>Gristwood, p. 301\u2013302</ref>\n\n==Marriage to William, Lord Beauchamp==\n[[File:2ndDukeOfSomerset.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[William Seymour, 2nd Duke of Somerset|William, 2nd Duke of Somerset]].]]\n[[File:Houghton - STC 8469. Arabella Stuart warrant.jpg|thumb|Royal warrant for arrest of Arbella, Lady Beauchamp, and [[William Seymour, 2nd Duke of Somerset|Lord Beauchamp]], 1611]]\nOn 5 June 1610 Arbella danced in [[Samuel Daniel]]'s masque ''[[Tethys' Festival]]'', one of the festivities at the investiture of Prince Henry as [[Prince of Wales]]. She followed, in order of precedence, Anne of Denmark and Princess Elizabeth.<ref>''Memorials of Affairs of State from the papers of Ralph Winwood'', vol. 3 (London, 1725), p. 181: Roy Strong, ''Henry Prince of Wales'' (London, 1986), pp. 155-158.</ref>\n\nArbella, who was fourth in line to the English throne, was in trouble again in 1610 for planning to marry [[William Seymour, 2nd Duke of Somerset|William Seymour]], then known as Lord Beauchamp, who later succeeded as 2nd [[Duke of Somerset]]. Lord Beauchamp was sixth-in-line, grandson of [[Lady Katherine Grey]], a younger sister of [[Lady Jane Grey]] and a granddaughter of [[Mary Tudor, Queen of France|Mary Tudor]], younger sister of King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and Arbella's ancestor, Margaret Tudor. Under the circumstances, the King wondered whether the marriage was the prelude to an attempt to seize [[the Crown]] itself.\n\nAlthough the couple at first denied that any arrangement existed between them, they later married in secret on 22 June 1610 at [[Greenwich Palace]]. For marrying without his permission, King James imprisoned them: Arbella in Sir Thomas Perry's house in [[Lambeth]] and Lord Beauchamp in the [[Tower of London]]. The couple had some liberty within those buildings, and some of Arbella's letters to Beauchamp and to the King during this period survive.  When the King learned of her letters to Lord Beauchamp, however, he ordered Arbella's transfer to the custody of [[William James (bishop)|William James]], [[Bishop of Durham]]. Arbella claimed to be ill, so her departure for [[Durham, England|Durham]] was delayed.\n\nThe couple used that delay to plan their escape.  Arbella dressed as a man and escaped to Lee (in [[Kent]]), but Lord Beauchamp did not meet her there before their getaway ship was to sail for France.  Sara Jayne Steen records that Imogen, the virtuous, cross-dressed heroine of [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Cymbeline]]'' (1610\u20131611), has sometimes been read as a reference to Arbella<ref>Steen, 96</ref> but the warrant for the couple's arrest is dated 3 June 1611 and [[Simon Forman]] recorded seeing a production of that play 2 months earlier in April.\n\nBeauchamp did escape from the Tower, but by the time he reached Lee, Arbella was gone, so he caught the next ship to [[Flanders]]. Arbella's ship was overtaken by King James's men just before it reached [[Calais]], France. She was returned to England and imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]].  She never saw her husband again and died in the Tower on 25 September 1615 from illnesses exacerbated by her refusal to eat.\n\n==Literary legacy==\nOver one hundred letters written by Arbella have survived. In 1993, a collection of them was published, edited by Sara Jayne Steen, providing details of her activities and ideas. The English novelist and historical biographer [[Doris Leslie]] wrote 'Wreath for Arabella' in 1948. [[Emilia Lanier]]'s poem ''Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum'' is dedicated to Arbella. Lanier recalls a former personal friendship with Arbella that was unrequited; she addresses her as \"Great learned Ladie ... whom long I have known but not known so much as I desired\".\n\n[[Felicia Hemans]]' poem ''Arabella Stuart'' is about Arbella, imagining her thoughts as she died in prison. In 2005, [[Sarah Gristwood]] published ''Arbella: England's Lost Queen''.\n\n==Family tree==\n{{family tree/start|align=center}}\n{{familytree | Jim| | | | | | | | | | | |Hank|Jim=[[James III of Scotland]]|Hank=[[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]]}}\n{{familytree | |!| | | | |,|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|+|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|.| |}}\n{{familytree | Jim|v|Marge| | | | | | | |Henry| | | | | |Mary|Jim=[[James IV of Scotland]]|Henry=[[Henry VIII of England]]|Mary=[[Mary Tudor, Queen of France|Mary Tudor]]|Marge=[[Margaret Tudor]]}}\n{{familytree | | | |!| | |!| | | | | |,|-|-|-|+|-|-|-|.| | | |!| | | ||}}\n{{familytree | |Jim| | |Marge| |Mary| |Bess| |Ed| |Fran|Mary=[[Mary I of England]]|Bess=[[Elizabeth I of England]]|Ed=[[Edward VI]]|Fran=[[Frances Grey, Duchess of Suffolk|Frances Brandon]]|Jim=[[James V of Scotland]]|Marge=[[Margaret Douglas]]}}\n{{familytree | |!| | | |,|-|^|-|.| | | | | | | | | | | |,|-|^|-|.|}}\n{{familytree |Mary|v|Henry| |Charles| | | | | | | | | |Jane| |Kate|Jane=[[Lady Jane Grey|Jane Grey]]|Kate=[[Lady Katherine Grey|Katherine Grey]]|Mary=[[Mary, Queen of Scots]]|Henry=[[Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley|Henry Stuart]]|Charles=[[Charles Stuart, 1st Earl of Lennox|Charles Stuart]]}}\n{{familytree | | | |!| | | | | |!| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |!| |}}\n{{familytree | | | |!| | | | | |!| | | | | | | | | | | | | | |Ed|Jim=[[Christopher Storey of England 6th earl of The Chantry Arms]]|Ed=[[Edward Seymour, Viscount Beauchamp|Edward Seymour]]}}\n{{familytree | | | |!| | | | | |!| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |!|}}\n{{familytree | | |Jim| | | |Bella|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|Will|Will=[[William Seymour, 2nd Duke of Somerset|William Seymour]]|Bella=Arbella Stuart|Jim=[[James VI and I]]}}\n{{Family tree/end}}\n\n===Ancestry===\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

During the reign of [[King James VI and I]], she married [[William Seymour, 2nd Duke of Somerset]] in secret. King James imprisoned William Seymour and placed her under house arrest. When she and her husband tried to escape England, she was captured and imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]], where she died at age 39.<ref name=\"National Trust\">{{cite web |title=The Story of Lady Arbella Stuart |url=https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/hardwick-hall/features/the-story-of-lady-arbella-stuart |website=National Trust UK |publisher=National Trust UK |accessdate=29 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Descent==\nShe was the only child of [[Charles Stuart, 1st Earl of Lennox]] (of the third creation), by his marriage to [[Elizabeth Stuart, Countess of Lennox|Elizabeth Cavendish]]. She was a grandchild of [[Matthew Stewart, 4th Earl of Lennox]] (of the second creation) and [[Margaret Douglas|Lady Margaret Douglas]], the daughter and heiress of [[Archibald Douglas, 6th Earl of Angus]], and of [[Margaret Tudor]], daughter of King [[Henry VII of England]] and widow of King [[James IV of Scotland]]. Arbella was therefore a great-great-granddaughter of King Henry VII of England and was in line of succession to the English throne, although she did not herself aspire to it.<ref>Rosalind K. Marshall, ''Stuart , Lady Arabella (1575\u20131615)'', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/601, accessed 3 March 2008]</ref>\n\nHer paternal grandparents, the 4th [[Earl of Lennox]] and Margaret Douglas, had, of their eight children, two sons who survived childhood: Arbella's father Charles and his older brother [[Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley]], who became the second husband of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], and the father of Arbella's cousin [[James VI and I|James VI and I of Scotland, England and Ireland]]. Her maternal grandparents were [[William Cavendish (courtier)|Sir William Cavendish]] and his wife [[Bess of Hardwick|Elizabeth]], better known as \"Bess of Hardwick\".\n\nIn her final days as a prisoner in the [[Tower of London]], Arbella Seymour (her married name), refusing to eat, fell ill, and died on 25 September 1615. She was buried in [[Westminster Abbey]] on 29 September 1615. In the 19th century, during a search for the tomb of James VI and I, Arbella's lead coffin was found in the vault of Mary, Queen of Scots, placed directly on top of that of the Scots queen.<ref>{{cite book|last=Stanley|first=A.

She was raised by her mother Elizabeth Cavendish, Countess of Lennox, until 1582.<ref>Antonia Fraser, ''Mary, Queen of Scots'', p. 535</ref> The death of her mother left seven-year-old Arbella an orphan, whereupon she became the [[Ward (law)|ward]] of her grandmother Bess, rather than [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|Lord Burghley]], the Master of the [[Court of Wards and Liveries|Court of Wards]], as might have been expected.<ref>Sarah Gristwood, ''Arbella: England's Lost Queen'', Bantam, 2003, p.49</ref>\n\nDuring most of her childhood she lived in the [[protective isolation]] of [[Hardwick Hall]] in Derbyshire with her grandmother, who had married [[George Talbot, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury]] in 1568. It seems she enjoyed periodic visits to the [[Court (royal)|court]] and to London, including court visits during the summers of 1587 and 1588 and one that lasted from November 1591 to July 1592.<ref>David N. Durant, ''Arbella Stuart: A Rival to the Queen'', 1978, pp.41, 51, 61</ref>\n\nStarting in early 1589 or thereabouts \"one Morley ... attended on Arbell and read to her\", as reported in a dispatch from Bess of Hardwick to Lord Burghley, dated 21 September 1592.<ref name=AS>Blanche C. Hardy, [https://archive.org/stream/arbellastuartbio00harduoft/arbellastuartbio00harduoft_djvu.txt ''Arbella Stuart: A Biography''], Dutton, 1913, pp.64\u201367</ref> Bess recounts Morley's service to Arbella over \"the space of three years and a half\". She also notes he had hoped for an annuity of \u00a340 a year ({{Inflation|GBP|40|1589|r=-2|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}) from Arbella based on the fact that he had \"been so much damnified [i.e. that much out of pocket] by leaving the University\". This has led to speculation that Morley was the poet [[Christopher Marlowe]],<ref>Charles Nicholl, ''The Reckoning: The Murder of Christopher Marlowe'', 1992, pp.340\u2013342</ref> whose name was sometimes spelled that way.\n\n== Heiress to the English throne==\n{{details|Succession to Elizabeth I of England}}\nFor some time before 1592, Arbella was considered one of the natural candidates to succeed her first cousin twice removed, Queen Elizabeth I.<ref>Marshall, p.601</ref> However, between the end of 1592 and the spring of 1593, the influential Cecils \u2013 Elizabeth's Lord Treasurer, Lord Burghley, and his son, Secretary of State [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Sir Robert Cecil]] \u2013 turned their attention away from Arbella towards her cousin [[James VI of Scotland]], regarding him as a preferable successor.<ref>Handover, ''The Second Cecil'', 55-6; 297; Read, ''Lord Burghley'', 484</ref>\n\nSometimes she was invited to Elizabeth's court, but much of her time she spent away living with her grandmother. Continuing her education into her twenties, she studied several languages and could play the [[lute]], [[viol]] and [[virginals]].<ref>{{cite book | title=Bess of Hardwick, First Lady of Chatsworth | last=Lovell | first=Mary S. | authorlink=Mary S.

When she was invited to participate by agreeing in writing to [[Philip III of Spain]], however, she immediately reported the invitation to the king.<ref>Gristwood, pp. 267\u2013269</ref>\n\n==Marriage negotiations==\nOwing to Arbella's status as a possible heir to the throne, there were discussions of appropriate marriages for her throughout her childhood. \n\nIn 1588, it was proposed to James VI of Scotland that [[Ludovic Stuart, 2nd Duke of Lennox]], should be married to Arbella, but nothing seems to have come of this suggestion either.<ref>Gristwood, p.109</ref> James VI was interested in this match but the Countess of Lennox's servant [[Thomas Fowler (courtier)|Thomas Fowler]] discouraged him.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 17.</ref> Other potential matches were the sons of  [[Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma]], who could claim the English throne as descendants of [[John of Gaunt]]. The idea was to secure toleration for English Catholics or even win Arbella for the Catholic faith. However, the eldest son, [[Ranuccio I Farnese, Duke of Parma|Ranuccio]], was already married, and the younger son, [[Odoardo Farnese (cardinal)|Odoardo]], was a Cardinal. The Pope was reportedly prepared to absolve Odoardo from his obligations but the resistance of Queen Elizabeth I to such a marriage stopped the plan probably even before Arbella could be approached.<ref name=AS /> \n\nIn the closing months of Elizabeth's reign, Arbella fell into trouble through reports that she intended to marry Edward Seymour, a member of the prominent Seymour family. This was reported to the Queen by the supposed groom's grandfather, [[Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford]]. Arbella denied having any intention of marrying without the Queen's permission. In 1604, [[Sigismund III Vasa]], [[List of Polish monarchs|King of Poland]], sent an ambassador to England to ask for Arbella to be his wife. This offer was rejected.<ref>Gristwood, p. 301\u2013302</ref>\n\n==Marriage to William, Lord Beauchamp==\n[[File:2ndDukeOfSomerset.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[William Seymour, 2nd Duke of Somerset|William, 2nd Duke of Somerset]].]]\n[[File:Houghton - STC 8469. Arabella Stuart warrant.jpg|thumb|Royal warrant for arrest of Arbella, Lady Beauchamp, and [[William Seymour, 2nd Duke of Somerset|Lord Beauchamp]], 1611]]\nOn 5 June 1610 Arbella danced in [[Samuel Daniel]]'s masque ''[[Tethys' Festival]]'', one of the festivities at the investiture of Prince Henry as [[Prince of Wales]]. She followed, in order of precedence, Anne of Denmark and Princess Elizabeth.<ref>''Memorials of Affairs of State from the papers of Ralph Winwood'', vol. 3 (London, 1725), p. 181: Roy Strong, ''Henry Prince of Wales'' (London, 1986), pp. 155-158.</ref>\n\nArbella, who was fourth in line to the English throne, was in trouble again in 1610 for planning to marry [[William Seymour, 2nd Duke of Somerset|William Seymour]], then known as Lord Beauchamp, who later succeeded as 2nd [[Duke of Somerset]]. Lord Beauchamp was sixth-in-line, grandson of [[Lady Katherine Grey]], a younger sister of [[Lady Jane Grey]] and a granddaughter of [[Mary Tudor, Queen of France|Mary Tudor]], younger sister of King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and Arbella's ancestor, Margaret Tudor. Under the circumstances, the King wondered whether the marriage was the prelude to an attempt to seize [[the Crown]] itself.\n\nAlthough the couple at first denied that any arrangement existed between them, they later married in secret on 22 June 1610 at [[Greenwich Palace]]. For marrying without his permission, King James imprisoned them: Arbella in Sir Thomas Perry's house in [[Lambeth]] and Lord Beauchamp in the [[Tower of London]]. The couple had some liberty within those buildings, and some of Arbella's letters to Beauchamp and to the King during this period survive.  When the King learned of her letters to Lord Beauchamp, however, he ordered Arbella's transfer to the custody of [[William James (bishop)|William James]], [[Bishop of Durham]]. Arbella claimed to be ill, so her departure for [[Durham, England|Durham]] was delayed.\n\nThe couple used that delay to plan their escape.  Arbella dressed as a man and escaped to Lee (in [[Kent]]), but Lord Beauchamp did not meet her there before their getaway ship was to sail for France.  Sara Jayne Steen records that Imogen, the virtuous, cross-dressed heroine of [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Cymbeline]]'' (1610\u20131611), has sometimes been read as a reference to Arbella<ref>Steen, 96</ref> but the warrant for the couple's arrest is dated 3 June 1611 and [[Simon Forman]] recorded seeing a production of that play 2 months earlier in April.\n\nBeauchamp did escape from the Tower, but by the time he reached Lee, Arbella was gone, so he caught the next ship to [[Flanders]]. Arbella's ship was overtaken by King James's men just before it reached [[Calais]], France. She was returned to England and imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]].  She never saw her husband again and died in the Tower on 25 September 1615 from illnesses exacerbated by her refusal to eat.\n\n==Literary legacy==\nOver one hundred letters written by Arbella have survived. In 1993, a collection of them was published, edited by Sara Jayne Steen, providing details of her activities and ideas. The English novelist and historical biographer [[Doris Leslie]] wrote 'Wreath for Arabella' in 1948. [[Emilia Lanier]]'s poem ''Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum'' is dedicated to Arbella. Lanier recalls a former personal friendship with Arbella that was unrequited; she addresses her as \"Great learned Ladie ... whom long I have known but not known so much as I desired\".\n\n[[Felicia Hemans]]' poem ''Arabella Stuart'' is about Arbella, imagining her thoughts as she died in prison. In 2005, [[Sarah Gristwood]] published ''Arbella: England's Lost Queen''.\n\n==Family tree==\n{{family tree/start|align=center}}\n{{familytree | Jim| | | | | | | | | | | |Hank|Jim=[[James III of Scotland]]|Hank=[[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]]}}\n{{familytree | |!| | | | |,|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|+|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|.| |}}\n{{familytree | Jim|v|Marge| | | | | | | |Henry| | | | | |Mary|Jim=[[James IV of Scotland]]|Henry=[[Henry VIII of England]]|Mary=[[Mary Tudor, Queen of France|Mary Tudor]]|Marge=[[Margaret Tudor]]}}\n{{familytree | | | |!| | |!| | | | | |,|-|-|-|+|-|-|-|.| | | |!| | | ||}}\n{{familytree | |Jim| | |Marge| |Mary| |Bess| |Ed| |Fran|Mary=[[Mary I of England]]|Bess=[[Elizabeth I of England]]|Ed=[[Edward VI]]|Fran=[[Frances Grey, Duchess of Suffolk|Frances Brandon]]|Jim=[[James V of Scotland]]|Marge=[[Margaret Douglas]]}}\n{{familytree | |!| | | |,|-|^|-|.| | | | | | | | | | | |,|-|^|-|.|}}\n{{familytree |Mary|v|Henry| |Charles| | | | | | | | | |Jane| |Kate|Jane=[[Lady Jane Grey|Jane Grey]]|Kate=[[Lady Katherine Grey|Katherine Grey]]|Mary=[[Mary, Queen of Scots]]|Henry=[[Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley|Henry Stuart]]|Charles=[[Charles Stuart, 1st Earl of Lennox|Charles Stuart]]}}\n{{familytree | | | |!| | | | | |!| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |!| |}}\n{{familytree | | | |!| | | | | |!| | | | | | | | | | | | | | |Ed|Jim=[[Christopher Storey of England 6th earl of The Chantry Arms]]|Ed=[[Edward Seymour, Viscount Beauchamp|Edward Seymour]]}}\n{{familytree | | | |!| | | | | |!| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |!|}}\n{{familytree | | |Jim| | | |Bella|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|Will|Will=[[William Seymour, 2nd Duke of Somerset|William Seymour]]|Bella=Arbella Stuart|Jim=[[James VI and I]]}}\n{{Family tree/end}}\n\n===Ancestry===\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

The town of Titel has a population of 5,247, while the population of the municipality of Titel is 15,738. It is located in southeastern part of the geographical region of [[Ba\u010dka]], known as [[\u0160ajka\u0161ka]].\n\n==Name==\nIn [[Serbian language|Serbian]], the town is known as ''Titel'' (\u0422\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b), in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] as ''Titel'', in [[German language|German]] as ''Titel'' (and sometimes ''Theissh\u00fcgel''), and in [[Latin language|Latin]] as ''Titulium''.\n\n==History==\nThe [[Titel Plateau]] is an elevated region between the Danube and Tisza rivers, close to the confluence; about {{convert|16|x|7|km|mi|abbr=off}}; roughly {{convert|80|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=off}}. It has an ellipsoid form and is characterized by steep slopes at the margins. It has a substantial loess cover and is often called the Titel Loess Plateau; the [[loess]] on the plateau is considered to contain the most detailed terrestrial palaeoclimate records in Europe, with a thick and apparently continuous record extending to the middle and late Early Pleistocene.<ref>Belij,S. et al 2009.

Slavs are mentioned in the area in the late 7th and early 8th century, while Magyars (Hungarians) settled the Pannonian Plain in 896, already in the next century holding the Tisa-Danube confluence. Grand Prince [[\u00c1rp\u00e1d]] (r. 895\u2013907) is believed to have defeated the Bulgars ([[Salan]]) at Titel. Titel was an important strategical location, and was included in the B\u00e1cs County. [[Ladislaus I of Hungary]] (r. 1077\u201395) and his brother [[Lampert of Hungary|Lampert]] founded an [[Augustinian]] monastery here. On 17 October 1389 a Clement was inscribed at the [[Vienna University]], who in Titel taught reading and cantillation. \n\nIn the 1400s, Titel belonged to the Serbian despot [[\u0110ura\u0111 Brankovi\u0107]]. In 1439 [[Albert II of Germany|Albert II]]'s army awaited in Titel military aid from the county to help \u0110ura\u0111 Brankovi\u0107 defend [[Smederevo]], but the aid never arrived.<ref name=Republika-16>{{cite book|title=Republika|volume=10|issue=197|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zMBpAAAAMAAJ|year=1998|publisher=Udru\u017eenje za jugoslovensku demokratsku inicijativu|p=16}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1526, the town was part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. According to the first Ottoman census from 1546, the town had 87 houses, of which most were [[Serbs|Serb]], three were [[Croats|Croat]], one [[Magyars|Hungarian]], and one [[Vlachs|Vlach]]. The duke of the town was [[Vuk Radi\u0107]]. That census recorded that five of the citizens were [[immigrants]], meaning that others lived there before Ottomans conquered the town.\n\nIn the outset of the Ottoman rule, the town had one [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] and one Catholic church. In the first quarter of the 17th century, the town had three [[mosques]], two [[Khanqah|tekkes]] and three [[Madrassah|medrese]]s.\n\nFrom 1699, the town was part of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. It was included in the Habsburg [[Military Frontier]]. Between 1750 and 1763, the town was under civil administration (in the [[B\u00e1cs-Bodrog County|Batsch-Bodrog County]] of the Habsburg [[Kingdom of Hungary]]), until it was returned to the jurisdiction of the Military Frontier ([[\u0160ajka\u0161 Battalion]]). Between 1763 and 1873, it was the headquarters of the \u0160ajka\u0161 Battalion which, using small armed vessels on the Danube, defended the Austrian border from Turkish attack. However, as early as 1750, the riverboat patrols, manned by the \u0160ajka\u0161 regiments, had begun to operate at Titel.\n\nWhen the Military Frontier was abolished, the Serbs emigrated to Russia in massive numbers. At that time, Banat and the \u0160ajka\u0161 area slowly began to lose its distinctive Serbian character. Hungarians, Germans, Slovaks, Ruthenians and others began to move into the region. \n\nIn 1848 and 1849, Titel was part of [[Serbian Vojvodina]], a Serb autonomous region within the Habsburg Empire. Between 1849 and 1872, it was again part of the Military Frontier, and after 1872, it came under civil administration as a part of the [[B\u00e1cs-Bodrog County]] within the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary (part of [[Austria-Hungary]]).\n\nIn 1910 there were 5,792 inhabitants: 2,413 Serbs and 1,858 Hungarians. By religion, there were 2,353 Serbian Orthodox; 2,479 Roman Catholics; and 89 Jews. \n\nAfter 1918, the town became part of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] and subsequent [[Yugoslavia|South Slavic]] states. During the [[World War II]] [[Hungarian occupation of Ba\u010dka and Baranja|Hungarian occupation]], in a 1942 raid, 51 inhabitants of the town were murdered, of whom 45 were men, 1 child, and 5 old people. By nationality, victims included 49 [[Serbs]], and 1 [[Jews|Jew]].\n\n==Inhabited places==\nTitel municipality encompasses the town of Titel, and the following villages:\n\n*[[Vilovo, Serbia|Vilovo]]\n*[[Gardinovci]]\n*[[Lok, Vojvodina|Lok]]\n*[[Mo\u0161orin]]\n*[[\u0160ajka\u0161]]\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n| type = \n| percentages = pagr\n|2011|15738\n| source = \n}}\nAs of 2011 census, the municipality of Titel has a population of 15,738 inhabitants.\n\n===Ethnic groups===\n{{See also|Serbs in Vojvodina|Hungarians in Vojvodina|Romani people of Vojvodina|Serbian lands|List of Hungarian communities in Vojvodina}}\nThe total population of the Titel municipality was 15,738, including:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://webrzs.stat.gov.rs/WebSite/Public/ReportResultView.aspx?rptKey=indId%3d18020101IND01%26102%3d80454%2636%3d0%2623%3d0%26111%3d01%2c02%2c03%2c04%2c05%2c06%2c07%2c08%2c09%2c10%2c11%2c12%2c13%2c14%2c15%2c16%2c17%2c18%2c19%2c20%2c21%2c22%2c23%2c24%2c25%2c26%26sAreaId%3d18020101%26dType%3dIdentificatorAndName%26lType%3dEnglish|title=Population by ethnicity \u2013 Titel|publisher=Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia (SORS)|accessdate=23 February 2013}}</ref>\n* 13,615 [[Serbs]] (86.51%)\n* 822 [[Hungarian people|Hungarians]] (5.22%)\n* 264 [[Romani people|Romani]] (1.68%)\n* 1037 other and undeclared.\n\nAll settlements in the municipality have an ethnic Serb majority.\n\n==Economy==\nThe following table gives a preview of total number of employed people per their core activity (as of 2017):<ref name=\"stats18\">{{cite web|title=\u041e\u041f\u0428\u0422\u0418\u041d\u0415 \u0418 \u0420\u0415\u0413\u0418\u041e\u041d\u0418 \u0423 \u0420\u0415\u041f\u0423\u0411\u041b\u0418\u0426\u0418 \u0421\u0420\u0411\u0418\u0408\u0418, 2018.|url=http://publikacije.stat.gov.rs/G2018/Pdf/G201813045.pdf|website=stat.gov.rs|publisher=[[Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia]]|accessdate=17 March 2019|language=Serbian}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|- \n!

The town of Titel has a population of 5,247, while the population of the municipality of Titel is 15,738. It is located in southeastern part of the geographical region of [[Ba\u010dka]], known as [[\u0160ajka\u0161ka]].\n\n==Name==\nIn [[Serbian language|Serbian]], the town is known as ''Titel'' (\u0422\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b), in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] as ''Titel'', in [[German language|German]] as ''Titel'' (and sometimes ''Theissh\u00fcgel''), and in [[Latin language|Latin]] as ''Titulium''.\n\n==History==\nThe [[Titel Plateau]] is an elevated region between the Danube and Tisza rivers, close to the confluence; about {{convert|16|x|7|km|mi|abbr=off}}; roughly {{convert|80|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=off}}. It has an ellipsoid form and is characterized by steep slopes at the margins. It has a substantial loess cover and is often called the Titel Loess Plateau; the [[loess]] on the plateau is considered to contain the most detailed terrestrial palaeoclimate records in Europe, with a thick and apparently continuous record extending to the middle and late Early Pleistocene.<ref>Belij,S. et al 2009.

Slavs are mentioned in the area in the late 7th and early 8th century, while Magyars (Hungarians) settled the Pannonian Plain in 896, already in the next century holding the Tisa-Danube confluence. Grand Prince [[\u00c1rp\u00e1d]] (r. 895\u2013907) is believed to have defeated the Bulgars ([[Salan]]) at Titel. Titel was an important strategical location, and was included in the B\u00e1cs County. [[Ladislaus I of Hungary]] (r. 1077\u201395) and his brother [[Lampert of Hungary|Lampert]] founded an [[Augustinian]] monastery here. On 17 October 1389 a Clement was inscribed at the [[Vienna University]], who in Titel taught reading and cantillation. \n\nIn the 1400s, Titel belonged to the Serbian despot [[\u0110ura\u0111 Brankovi\u0107]]. In 1439 [[Albert II of Germany|Albert II]]'s army awaited in Titel military aid from the county to help \u0110ura\u0111 Brankovi\u0107 defend [[Smederevo]], but the aid never arrived.<ref name=Republika-16>{{cite book|title=Republika|volume=10|issue=197|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zMBpAAAAMAAJ|year=1998|publisher=Udru\u017eenje za jugoslovensku demokratsku inicijativu|p=16}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1526, the town was part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. According to the first Ottoman census from 1546, the town had 87 houses, of which most were [[Serbs|Serb]], three were [[Croats|Croat]], one [[Magyars|Hungarian]], and one [[Vlachs|Vlach]]. The duke of the town was [[Vuk Radi\u0107]]. That census recorded that five of the citizens were [[immigrants]], meaning that others lived there before Ottomans conquered the town.\n\nIn the outset of the Ottoman rule, the town had one [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] and one Catholic church. In the first quarter of the 17th century, the town had three [[mosques]], two [[Khanqah|tekkes]] and three [[Madrassah|medrese]]s.\n\nFrom 1699, the town was part of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. It was included in the Habsburg [[Military Frontier]]. Between 1750 and 1763, the town was under civil administration (in the [[B\u00e1cs-Bodrog County|Batsch-Bodrog County]] of the Habsburg [[Kingdom of Hungary]]), until it was returned to the jurisdiction of the Military Frontier ([[\u0160ajka\u0161 Battalion]]). Between 1763 and 1873, it was the headquarters of the \u0160ajka\u0161 Battalion which, using small armed vessels on the Danube, defended the Austrian border from Turkish attack. However, as early as 1750, the riverboat patrols, manned by the \u0160ajka\u0161 regiments, had begun to operate at Titel.\n\nWhen the Military Frontier was abolished, the Serbs emigrated to Russia in massive numbers. At that time, Banat and the \u0160ajka\u0161 area slowly began to lose its distinctive Serbian character. Hungarians, Germans, Slovaks, Ruthenians and others began to move into the region. \n\nIn 1848 and 1849, Titel was part of [[Serbian Vojvodina]], a Serb autonomous region within the Habsburg Empire. Between 1849 and 1872, it was again part of the Military Frontier, and after 1872, it came under civil administration as a part of the [[B\u00e1cs-Bodrog County]] within the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary (part of [[Austria-Hungary]]).\n\nIn 1910 there were 5,792 inhabitants: 2,413 Serbs and 1,858 Hungarians. By religion, there were 2,353 Serbian Orthodox; 2,479 Roman Catholics; and 89 Jews. \n\nAfter 1918, the town became part of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] and subsequent [[Yugoslavia|South Slavic]] states. During the [[World War II]] [[Hungarian occupation of Ba\u010dka and Baranja|Hungarian occupation]], in a 1942 raid, 51 inhabitants of the town were murdered, of whom 45 were men, 1 child, and 5 old people. By nationality, victims included 49 [[Serbs]], and 1 [[Jews|Jew]].\n\n==Inhabited places==\nTitel municipality encompasses the town of Titel, and the following villages:\n\n*[[Vilovo, Serbia|Vilovo]]\n*[[Gardinovci]]\n*[[Lok, Vojvodina|Lok]]\n*[[Mo\u0161orin]]\n*[[\u0160ajka\u0161]]\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n| type = \n| percentages = pagr\n|2011|15738\n| source = \n}}\nAs of 2011 census, the municipality of Titel has a population of 15,738 inhabitants.\n\n===Ethnic groups===\n{{See also|Serbs in Vojvodina|Hungarians in Vojvodina|Romani people of Vojvodina|Serbian lands|List of Hungarian communities in Vojvodina}}\nThe total population of the Titel municipality was 15,738, including:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://webrzs.stat.gov.rs/WebSite/Public/ReportResultView.aspx?rptKey=indId%3d18020101IND01%26102%3d80454%2636%3d0%2623%3d0%26111%3d01%2c02%2c03%2c04%2c05%2c06%2c07%2c08%2c09%2c10%2c11%2c12%2c13%2c14%2c15%2c16%2c17%2c18%2c19%2c20%2c21%2c22%2c23%2c24%2c25%2c26%26sAreaId%3d18020101%26dType%3dIdentificatorAndName%26lType%3dEnglish|title=Population by ethnicity \u2013 Titel|publisher=Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia (SORS)|accessdate=23 February 2013}}</ref>\n* 13,615 [[Serbs]] (86.51%)\n* 822 [[Hungarian people|Hungarians]] (5.22%)\n* 264 [[Romani people|Romani]] (1.68%)\n* 1037 other and undeclared.\n\nAll settlements in the municipality have an ethnic Serb majority.\n\n==Economy==\nThe following table gives a preview of total number of employed people per their core activity (as of 2017):<ref name=\"stats18\">{{cite web|title=\u041e\u041f\u0428\u0422\u0418\u041d\u0415 \u0418 \u0420\u0415\u0413\u0418\u041e\u041d\u0418 \u0423 \u0420\u0415\u041f\u0423\u0411\u041b\u0418\u0426\u0418 \u0421\u0420\u0411\u0418\u0408\u0418, 2018.|url=http://publikacije.stat.gov.rs/G2018/Pdf/G201813045.pdf|website=stat.gov.rs|publisher=[[Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia]]|accessdate=17 March 2019|language=Serbian}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|- \n!
