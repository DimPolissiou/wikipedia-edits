He grew up in [[Culver City, California]] and later, [[West Los Angeles]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nWhen he was 11 years old, his eldest half-brother, Bobby Lucas, died of a heroin overdose at the age of 27, thought to have been murdered by a disgruntled drug dealer who intentionally sold him an unusually potent batch of the drug. \n\nHe grew up believing that his biological father was a man named Harold \"Hal\" Beahm, who had left the family early on in his life. {{citation needed|date=July 2018}} When he was a teenager, one of his elder half-sisters, Faith Jr., revealed in an argument that his biological father was actually a [[Swedish people|Swedish]] sailor named William Bj\u00f6rklund. \n\nBeahm lived with his mother Faith Reynolds-Baker for much of his life, but their relationship was tumultuous. The accounts given of her in [[Brendan Mullen]] and [[Don Bolles (musician)|Don Bolles']] 2002 book ''Lexicon Devil: The Fast Times and Short Life of Darby Crash and the Germs'' portray her as having a mental illness, which caused her to behave erratically and be verbally abusive toward her son.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mullen|title=Lexicon Devil|pages=40\u201341}}</ref> \n\nFaith's third husband, Bob Baker, died suddenly of a heart attack at 39 in 1972; they had married in 1964 when a very young Beahm introduced the idea of them marrying after they began dating. She never married Beahm's biological father, and not long after Bob Baker's death, Beahm learned that his biological father, whom he never met, was also deceased. Bob Baker was a Korean War veteran.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} \n\nBeahm attended Innovative Program School, an alternative school within [[University High School (Los Angeles, California)|University High School]] in [[Los Angeles]], which Beahm dubbed \"Interplanetary School\". The IPS program combined elements of [[Erhard Seminars Training|''est'' large group awareness training]] and [[Scientology]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Mullen |first=Brendan |title=Annihilation Man; How Darby Crash lost control.

The two were accused of [[brainwashing]] the other students and causing them to behave subversively, which led to the dismissal of Beahm and Ruthenberg from the school in 1976.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mullen|title=Lexicon Devil|page=23}}</ref> Beahm said to a friend: \"Acid took two years of my life. I don't remember anything.\"\n\nAfter being threatened that police would be called if Beahm showed himself back on campus, he went to the school board to fight for his diploma.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} According to his mother, Beahm later enrolled at [[Santa Monica College]], where he took courses in dance, ballet, and tap. He also made and sold jewelry.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n== The Germs ==\n\nNot long after their dismissal from IPS, Beahm and Ruthenberg began trying to form a band, inspired by groups like [[The Runaways]] and [[The Stooges]]. Before they settled on the Germs as a band name, they called themselves \"Sophistifuck\" and the Revlon Spam Queens, but had to use a shorter name because they didn't have enough money to put this on a t-shirt.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZHP-r9-eqdAC&pg=PA391 Alternative rock] By Dave Thompson p. 391</ref> \n\nAfter putting out an ad requesting \"two untalented girls\" who couldn't play their instruments, the two friends were joined by the suitably inexperienced bassist Terri Ryan, soon to be rechristened [[Lorna Doom]], and drummer [[Belinda Carlisle]], dubbed Dottie Danger, who never played a show with the group due to an extended bout of [[mononucleosis]] and went on to fame and fortune as both lead vocalist of [[The Go-Go's]] and an even more successful solo artist. She was quickly replaced with Becky Barton (aka Donna Rhia), who played three gigs with the group and recorded with them on their debut single, 1977's \"[[Forming (song)|Forming]].\"\n\nWhen the Germs initially began playing out, the only member who was proficient with an instrument was Ruthenberg, who now called himself Pat Smear.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mullen|title=Lexicon Devil|page=46}}</ref> Beahm initially dubbed himself Bobby Pyn, as he is credited on the group's first recording, but soon jettisoned the moniker in favor of the more overtly menacing Darby Crash, a name which he had initially referred to in the lyrics of the song \"[[Lexicon Devil|Circle One]].\"  Beahm got the name \"Darby Crash\" from reading an obituary in the local newspaper that stated a man named Darby died in a car crash.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe Germs were captured famously in [[Penelope Spheeris]]' 1981 film ''[[The Decline of Western Civilization]]''. The film features a characteristically hectic and sloppy live show in which Crash, heavily intoxicated and under the influence of several drugs, calls to the audience for beer, stumbles and crawls on the stage and slurs lyrics while members of the audience write on him with permanent markers.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Decline of Western Civilization (1981)| url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B04E7DF1E38F936A35754C0A967948260|work=[[The New York Times]] |year=1981|author=Janet Maslin|accessdate=31 August 2013}}</ref> \n\nDuring an interview in the film, Crash also discusses taking drugs onstage to avoid feeling injuries from fan violence and \"creeps out there with grudges.\" The Germs were well known for their violent, chaotic performances, often exacerbated by Crash's drug abuse, which increased steadily over the group's brief lifespan. \n\nAll of this resulted in the band being banned from nearly every rock club in Los Angeles, which they nevertheless managed to avoid by playing under the alias G.I. (standing for \"Germs Incognito\"). By the point in which they were filmed for ''The Decline of Western Civilization'', in late 1979, director Spheeris had to rent a soundstage called Cherrywood Studios in California in order for them to play a show outside of the club circuit from which they had been largely blacklisted.\n\n== Later life and suicide ==\nPlagued by Crash's worsening heroin addiction, and live performances that now often ended prematurely due to violent conflict between audience members and the [[Los Angeles Police Department]], the Germs disintegrated in April 1980, their last show being April 26 at the Fleetwood in Redondo Beach. \n\nCrash traveled to [[United Kingdom|Britain]], where he became heavily enamored with the music of [[Adam and the Ants]], adopted an Adam Ant\u2013inspired new look that included a [[Mohawk hairstyle|mohawk]], and put on a considerable amount of weight (some of which he eventually lost). Upon his return to the U.S., Crash formed the very short-lived Darby Crash Band; [[Circle Jerks]] drummer [[Lucky Lehrer]] joined the ill-fated ensemble on the eve of their first live performance after Crash kicked out the drummer they'd rehearsed with during soundcheck and convinced [[Pat Smear]] to act as the group's guitarist. Smear described the band as \"like the Germs, but with worse players\".\n\nOn December 3, 1980, an over-sold [[Starwood (nightclub)|Starwood]] hosted a final live show of the reunited Germs, including drummer Don Bolles.<ref>Mullen, Lexicon Devil</ref> Crash committed [[suicide]] by intentional heroin overdose on December 7, 1980, in a house in the Mid-Wilshire section of [[Hollywood, California]].<ref>[https://archive.org/details/tombstonetourist00stan_0/page/306 The tombstone tourist: musicians] By Scott Stanton p. 306</ref> According to ''[[SPIN magazine]]'', apocryphal lore has Crash attempting to write \"Here Lies Darby Crash\" on the wall as he lay dying, but not finishing. In reality, he wrote a short note to Darby Crash Band bassist David \"Bosco\" Danford that stated \"My life, my leather, my love goes to Bosco.\"<ref name=\"Spin_17-5_p106\"/>\n\nHis death was largely overshadowed by that of [[John Lennon]], who was killed by [[Mark David Chapman]] in New York one day after Crash's suicide.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mullen|title=Lexicon Devil|page=265}}</ref> His female friend Casey Cola Hopkins was with him that night, at her mother's main house.

He grew up in [[Culver City, California]] and later, [[West Los Angeles]]. \n\nWhen he was 11 years old, his eldest half-brother, Bobby Lucas, died of a heroin overdose at the age of 27, thought to have been murdered by a disgruntled drug dealer who intentionally sold him an unusually potent batch of the drug. \n\nHe grew up believing that his biological father was a man named Harold \"Hal\" Beahm, who had left the family early on in his life. {{citation needed|date=July 2018}} When he was a teenager, one of his elder half-sisters, Faith Jr., revealed in an argument that his biological father was actually a [[Swedish people|Swedish]] sailor named William Bj\u00f6rklund. \n\nBeahm lived with his mother Faith Reynolds-Baker for much of his life, but their relationship was tumultuous. The accounts given of her in [[Brendan Mullen]] and [[Don Bolles (musician)|Don Bolles']] 2002 book ''Lexicon Devil: The Fast Times and Short Life of Darby Crash and the Germs'' portray her as having a mental illness, which caused her to behave erratically and be verbally abusive toward her son.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mullen|title=Lexicon Devil|pages=40\u201341}}</ref> \n\nFaith's third husband, Bob Baker, died suddenly of a heart attack at 39 in 1972; they had married in 1964 when a very young Beahm introduced the idea of them marrying after they began dating. She never married Beahm's biological father, and not long after Bob Baker's death, Beahm learned that his biological father, whom he never met, was also deceased. Bob Baker was a Korean War veteran.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} \n\nBeahm attended Innovative Program School, an alternative school within [[University High School (Los Angeles, California)|University High School]] in [[Los Angeles]], which Beahm dubbed \"Interplanetary School\". The IPS program combined elements of [[Erhard Seminars Training|''est'' large group awareness training]] and [[Scientology]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Mullen |first=Brendan |title=Annihilation Man; How Darby Crash lost control.

The two were accused of [[brainwashing]] the other students and causing them to behave subversively, which led to the dismissal of Beahm and Ruthenberg from the school in 1976.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mullen|title=Lexicon Devil|page=23}}</ref> Beahm said to a friend: \"Acid took two years of my life. I don't remember anything.\"\n\nAfter being threatened that police would be called if Beahm showed himself back on campus, he went to the school board to fight for his diploma.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} According to his mother, Beahm later enrolled at [[Santa Monica College]], where he took courses in dance, ballet, and tap. He also made and sold jewelry.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n== The Germs ==\n\nNot long after their dismissal from IPS, Beahm and Ruthenberg began trying to form a band, inspired by groups like [[The Runaways]] and [[The Stooges]]. Before they settled on the Germs as a band name, they called themselves \"Sophistifuck\" and the Revlon Spam Queens, but had to use a shorter name because they didn't have enough money to put this on a t-shirt.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZHP-r9-eqdAC&pg=PA391 Alternative rock] By Dave Thompson p. 391</ref> \n\nAfter putting out an ad requesting \"two untalented girls\" who couldn't play their instruments, the two friends were joined by the suitably inexperienced bassist Terri Ryan, soon to be rechristened [[Lorna Doom]], and drummer [[Belinda Carlisle]], dubbed Dottie Danger, who never played a show with the group due to an extended bout of [[mononucleosis]] and went on to fame and fortune as both lead vocalist of [[The Go-Go's]] and an even more successful solo artist. She was quickly replaced with Becky Barton (aka Donna Rhia), who played three gigs with the group and recorded with them on their debut single, 1977's \"[[Forming (song)|Forming]].\"\n\nWhen the Germs initially began playing out, the only member who was proficient with an instrument was Ruthenberg, who now called himself Pat Smear.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mullen|title=Lexicon Devil|page=46}}</ref> Beahm initially dubbed himself Bobby Pyn, as he is credited on the group's first recording, but soon jettisoned the moniker in favor of the more overtly menacing Darby Crash, a name which he had initially referred to in the lyrics of the song \"[[Lexicon Devil|Circle One]].\"  Beahm got the name \"Darby Crash\" from reading an obituary in the local newspaper that stated a man named Darby died in a car crash.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe Germs were captured famously in [[Penelope Spheeris]]' 1981 film ''[[The Decline of Western Civilization]]''. The film features a characteristically hectic and sloppy live show in which Crash, heavily intoxicated and under the influence of several drugs, calls to the audience for beer, stumbles and crawls on the stage and slurs lyrics while members of the audience write on him with permanent markers.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Decline of Western Civilization (1981)| url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B04E7DF1E38F936A35754C0A967948260|work=[[The New York Times]] |year=1981|author=Janet Maslin|accessdate=31 August 2013}}</ref> \n\nDuring an interview in the film, Crash also discusses taking drugs onstage to avoid feeling injuries from fan violence and \"creeps out there with grudges.\" The Germs were well known for their violent, chaotic performances, often exacerbated by Crash's drug abuse, which increased steadily over the group's brief lifespan. \n\nAll of this resulted in the band being banned from nearly every rock club in Los Angeles, which they nevertheless managed to avoid by playing under the alias G.I. (standing for \"Germs Incognito\"). By the point in which they were filmed for ''The Decline of Western Civilization'', in late 1979, director Spheeris had to rent a soundstage called Cherrywood Studios in California in order for them to play a show outside of the club circuit from which they had been largely blacklisted.\n\n== Later life and suicide ==\nPlagued by Crash's worsening heroin addiction, and live performances that now often ended prematurely due to violent conflict between audience members and the [[Los Angeles Police Department]], the Germs disintegrated in April 1980, their last show being April 26 at the Fleetwood in Redondo Beach. \n\nCrash traveled to [[United Kingdom|Britain]], where he became heavily enamored with the music of [[Adam and the Ants]], adopted an Adam Ant\u2013inspired new look that included a [[Mohawk hairstyle|mohawk]], and put on a considerable amount of weight (some of which he eventually lost). Upon his return to the U.S., Crash formed the very short-lived Darby Crash Band; [[Circle Jerks]] drummer [[Lucky Lehrer]] joined the ill-fated ensemble on the eve of their first live performance after Crash kicked out the drummer they'd rehearsed with during soundcheck and convinced [[Pat Smear]] to act as the group's guitarist. Smear described the band as \"like the Germs, but with worse players\".\n\nOn December 3, 1980, an over-sold [[Starwood (nightclub)|Starwood]] hosted a final live show of the reunited Germs, including drummer Don Bolles.<ref>Mullen, Lexicon Devil</ref> Crash committed [[suicide]] by intentional heroin overdose on December 7, 1980, in a house in the Mid-Wilshire section of [[Hollywood, California]].<ref>[https://archive.org/details/tombstonetourist00stan_0/page/306 The tombstone tourist: musicians] By Scott Stanton p. 306</ref> According to ''[[SPIN magazine]]'', apocryphal lore has Crash attempting to write \"Here Lies Darby Crash\" on the wall as he lay dying, but not finishing. In reality, he wrote a short note to Darby Crash Band bassist David \"Bosco\" Danford that stated \"My life, my leather, my love goes to Bosco.\"<ref name=\"Spin_17-5_p106\"/>\n\nHis death was largely overshadowed by that of [[John Lennon]], who was killed by [[Mark David Chapman]] in New York one day after Crash's suicide.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mullen|title=Lexicon Devil|page=265}}</ref> His female friend Casey Cola Hopkins was with him that night, at her mother's main house.

As a prince, the Bishop held an [[Imperial State|Imperial Estate]] and had seat and voice at the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]]. The Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge should not be confused with the Bishop's [[diocese of Li\u00e8ge]], which was larger.\n\nThe bishops of [[Li\u00e8ge]] acquired their status as a [[Prince-bishop]] between 980 and 985 when [[Notker of Li\u00e8ge|Bishop Notger]], who had been the bishop of Liege since 972, received secular control of the [[County of Huy]] from [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor]].\n\nThe Prince-Bishopric belonged from 1500 on to the [[Lower Rhenish\u2013Westphalian Circle]]. Its territory included most of the present Belgian provinces of [[Li\u00e8ge (province)|Li\u00e8ge]] and [[Limburg (Belgium)|Limburg]], and some exclaves in other parts of Belgium and the Netherlands.\n\nIt briefly became a republic (the [[Republic of Li\u00e8ge]]) from 1789 to 1791, before reverting to a Prince-Bishopric in 1791. The role of the Bishop as prince permanently ended when the state was annexed by France in 1795.  In 1815 the territories it had held became part of the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]], and in 1830 they were within the part of that kingdom which split off to become [[Belgium]].\n\nThe principality ruled by the bishops of Li\u00e8ge was never part of the [[Seventeen Provinces]] or the Spanish and Austrian [[Southern Netherlands]], but from the 16th century onwards its politics were strongly influenced by the [[duke of Burgundy|dukes of Burgundy]] and later the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburgs]].\n\nIn 1559 its 1,636 [[parish]]es were grouped into eight [[archdeacon]]ries, and twenty-eight councils, ''{{lang|fr|chr\u00e9tient\u00e9s}}'' ([[deanery|deaneries]]). The most important cities (''{{lang|fr|bonnes villes}}'') of the bishopric were: Li\u00e8ge, [[Beringen, Belgium|Beringen]], [[Bilzen]], [[Borgloon]], [[Bree, Belgium|Bree]], [[Ch\u00e2telet, Belgium|Ch\u00e2telet]], [[Ciney]], [[Couvin]], [[Dinant]], [[Fosses-la-Ville]], [[Hamont-Achel|Hamont]], [[Hasselt]], [[Herk-de-Stad]], [[Huy]], [[Maaseik]], [[Peer, Belgium|Peer]], [[Sint-Truiden]], [[Dilsen-Stokkem|Stokkem]], [[Thuin]], [[Tongeren]], [[Verviers]], [[Vis\u00e9]] and [[Waremme]].\n\nThe city of [[Maastricht]] fell under the [[condominium (international law)|joint jurisdiction]] of the Prince-Bishop of Li\u00e8ge and the [[Duchy of Brabant|Duke of Brabant]] (later the [[States-General of the Netherlands|States-General of the United Provinces]]). The second city of the prince-bishopric thus kept its ''{{lang|fr|[[status aparte]]}}'' throughout the ''{{lang|fr|ancien r\u00e9gime}}''.\n\n==Medieval prince-bishopric==\n[[File:Belgian Medieval Dioceses.png|thumb|right|This map shows the pre-1559 medieval [[Diocese of Li\u00e8ge]] (in green) which evolved from the ''{{lang|la|Civitas Tungrorum}}'' and probably had similar boundaries.]]\nThe large diocese of the medieval bishops was, until 1559, much larger than the princedom which was in their possession. However, the princely domain was gradually enlarged by donations and by acquisitions. In the 10th century, the bishops received [[secular]] power over the [[county of Huy]], which lay within of the [[diocese]]. Bishop [[Notker of Li\u00e8ge|Notger]] (972\u20131008) thus became a sovereign prince. This status was retained by his successors until the [[French Revolution]], and throughout that period of nearly eight centuries the Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge succeeded in maintaining a level of autonomy, though theoretically it was part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. This virtual independence was owed largely to the ability of its bishops, who on several occasions played an important part in international politics, being strategically positioned between [[France]] and [[Germany]], .\n\nThroughout the Middle Ages, the prince-bishopric was further expanded with the [[lords of Bouillon|lordship of Bouillon]] in 1096 (ceded to France in 1678), the acquisition of the [[county of Loon]] ({{lang-fr|Looz}}) in 1366 and the [[county of Horne]] in 1568.\n\nNotger, the founder of the principality, also rebuilt the cathedral of St Lambert, as well as the episcopal palace. He was also involved in other building activities in the city, which flourished under his rule (churches of St Paul, St. John the Evangelist, Sainte-Croix and St Denis). This bishop also strengthened the parochial organization of the city. He was one of the first church leaders to spread the observance of [[All Souls' Day]], which he authorized for his diocese. Under Notger's administration, following up on the work of Heraclius, educational institutions in Li\u00e8ge flourished. With these two bishops (and [[Wazo]]) \"The schools of Li\u00e8ge were, in fact, at that time one of the brightest literary foci of the period\". In the 11th century the city was indeed known as the ''Athens of the North''. \"Li\u00e8ge for more than a century occupied among the nations a position in regard to science which it has never recovered\". Subsequent bishops, Balderic of Looz (1008\u201318), [[Wolbodo]] (1018\u201321), Durandus (1021\u201325), Reginard (1025\u201338), Nitard (1038\u201342), the learned [[Wazo]], and Theoduin (1048\u201375), valiantly sustained the heritage of Notger. The schools formed many brilliant scholars, and gave the Catholic Church popes [[Pope Stephen IX|Stephen IX]] and [[Pope Nicholas II|Nicholas II]]. The diocese also supplied the [[University of Paris]] with a number of important doctors \u2014 [[William of Saint-Thierry]], [[Gerard of Li\u00e8ge]] and [[Godfrey of Fontaines]]. [[Alger of Li\u00e8ge]] (1055\u20131131) was an important intellectual of the period. He was first appointed deacon of [[St Bartholomew's Church, Li\u00e8ge|church of St Bartholomew]] and finally retired at the monastery of [[Cluny]].\n\nIn the reign of [[Henry of Verdun]] (1075\u201391) a tribunal was instituted (''{{lang|fr|tribunal de la paix}}'') to prevent war and enforce the [[Peace of God]]. [[Otbert of Li\u00e8ge|Otbert]] (1091\u20131119) increased the territory of the principality by purchasing the [[Lords of Bouillon|Lordship of Bouillon]]. He remained faithful to emperor [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]], who died as his guest. Henry of Namur (1119\u201321) was venerated as a martyr. During the administration of [[Alexander of Juliers]] (1128\u201334) the [[pope]], the [[Holy Roman Emperor|emperor]] and [[Bernard of Clairvaux|St Bernard]] visited Li\u00e8ge. The episcopate of [[Raoul of Zachringen]] was marked by the preaching of the reformer [[Lambert le B\u00e8gue]], who is credited with founding the [[b\u00e9guine]]s.\n\n[[Albert of Louvain]] was elected Bishop of Li\u00e8ge in 1191, but [[Emperor Henry VI]], on the pretext that the election was doubtful, gave the see to Lothair of Hochstadt. Albero's election was confirmed by the pope but in 1192, shortly after he took office, he was assassinated by three German knights at [[Reims]]. It is probable that the emperor was privy to this murder but Albero was canonized. In 1195, Albert de Cuyck (1195\u20131200) formally recognized the [[suffrage|political franchise]] of the people of Li\u00e8ge. During the 12th century, the cathedral [[chapter (religion)|chapter]], along with the bishop, assumed a more important role in the history of the principality.\n\nThe struggles between the upper and lower classes, in which the prince-bishops frequently intervened, developed through the 13th and 14th centuries, and culminate in the 15th century in the pillage and destruction of the episcopal city. In the reign of Robert of Thourotte (1240\u201346), [[Juliana of Li\u00e8ge|Saint Juliana]] \u2014 a nun of [[Cornillon Abbey]] \u2014 was led by certain visions to the project of having a feast established in honour of the [[Blessed Sacrament]]. After much hesitation, the bishop approved of her idea but death prevented the institution of the feast. The completion of the work was left to a former [[prior]] of the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] in Li\u00e8ge, [[Hugh of Saint-Cher]], who returned to the city as papal legate. In 1252 Hugh made the feast of the [[Blessed Sacrament]] an obligation throughout his diocese. John of Troyes, who, after having been archdeacon at Li\u00e8ge, was elected pope as [[Pope Urban IV|Urban IV]], encouraged the observance of the feast of [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]] in the whole Church. Another archdeacon of Li\u00e8ge became pope under the name [[Pope Gregory X|Gregory X]] and deposed the unworthy Henry of [[Gueldres]] (1247\u201374). The [[Peace of Fexhe]], signed in 1316 during the reign of [[Adolph II de la Marck (Bishop)|Adolph II de la Marck]] (1313\u201344), regulated the relations between the prince-bishop and his subjects. Nevertheless, internal discord continued and the episcopate of Arnold of [[County of Horne|Horne]] (1378\u201389) was marked by the triumph of the popular party. In 1366, the [[county of Loon]] was annexed to the bishopric.\n\n==Burgundian and Habsburg influence==\n[[File:Court concert at Li\u00e8ge.jpg|thumb|Prince-Bishop Johann Theodor of Bavaria at a court concert at Li\u00e8ge]]\n[[File:Het paleis van de prins-bisschoppen.jpg|thumb|The Archiepiscopal Palace at Li\u00e8ge]]\nUpon the death of [[Louis II of Flanders|Louis of Male]], [[count of Flanders]], in 1384, the Low Countries began their unification within the [[Burgundian Netherlands]]. Though the Principality was still nominally independent, the [[Duke of Burgundy|Dukes of Burgundy]] have had an increasing influence on its government.  [[Louis de Bourbon, Bishop of Li\u00e8ge|Louis of Bourbon]] (1456\u201382) was placed on the throne of Li\u00e8ge by the political machinations of [[Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy]]. The population resisted Burgundian rule leading to the [[Li\u00e8ge Wars]], the destruction of [[Dinant]] in 1466, and of Li\u00e8ge in 1468 by [[Charles the Bold]], marking the ending of democratic ascendancy in the Principality.\n\n[[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] completed the union of the [[Seventeen Provinces]] in the 1540s, and unofficially also controlled the principality.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chapter II: Habsburg Rule in the Netherlands |work=History of Holland |last=Edmundson |first=George |authorlink=George Edmundson |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1922 |url=http://www.authorama.com/history-of-holland-4.html |accessdate=9 June 2007 }}</ref> He nominated [[Erard de la Marck]] (1505\u201338) who brought a period of restoration. Erard was an enlightened protector of the arts. It was he who commenced the struggle against the [[Protestant Reformation|Protestant reformers]], which his successors carried forth, especially Gerard of Groesbeeck (1564\u201380). With the object of assisting in this struggle, [[Pope Paul IV|Paul IV]], by [[Papal bull|Bull]] (''{{lang|la|[[Super Universi]]}}'', 12 May 1559), created new bishoprics in the [[Low Countries]]. The new bishoprics were created largely at the expense of the diocese of Li\u00e8ge; many of its parishes were given to the dioceses of [[Diocese of Roermond|Roermond]], [[Diocese of Bois-le-Duc|'s-Hertogenbosch]], and [[Diocese of Namur|Namur]], or were added to the existing dioceses of [[Archbishopric of Mechelen-Brussels|Mechelen]] and [[Diocese of Antwerp|Antwerp]]. The number of deaneries in the diocese of Li\u00e8ge was reduced to 13.\n\nLi\u00e8ge formed the last link in the chain of Habsburg allies that made up the so-called [[Spanish Road]], a military corridor between Spanish-controlled [[Lombardy]] and the [[Spanish Netherlands]]. Completely encircled by Spanish territory, Li\u00e8ge was protected by treaties of neutrality which permitted the passage of Spanish troops through the prince-bishop's territory provided that they spent no more than two nights in one place. The importance of the prince-bishopric to Habsburg military logistics in the [[Eighty Years War]] prompted Spanish intervention foiling a Dutch invasion in 1595.<ref>{{Cite book |first=Geoffrey |last=Parker |title=The Army of Flanders and the Spanish Road, 1567\u20131659: The Logistics of Spanish Victory and Defeat in the Low Countries' Wars |location=London |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=1972 |page=61 }}</ref>\n\nMost of the bishops in the 17th century were foreigners, many of them holding several bishoprics at once. Their frequent absences gave free scope for those feuds of the [[Chiroux]] and the [[Grignoux]] to which [[Maximilian Henry of Bavaria]] ([[archbishop of Cologne]], 1650\u201388) put a stop by the Edict of 1681. In the middle of the 18th century the ideas of the French [[encyclopedist]]s began to be received at Li\u00e8ge; Bishop [[Fran\u00e7ois-Charles de Velbr\u00fcck|de Velbr\u00fcck]] (1772\u201384), encouraged their propagation and thus prepared the way for the {{lang|fr|[[Revolution Li\u00e9geoise]]}}. Partially connected with the French Revolution, a protest against the absolutist rule of prince bishop [[Cesar Constantijn Frans van Hoensbroeck]] developed into the 1789 Revolution in Li\u00e8ge. At the beginning of 1791, the revolution was crushed by troops on the orders of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nThe prince-bishopric was dissolved in 1795, when it was annexed by [[France]]. Its territory was divided over the d\u00e9partements [[Meuse-Inf\u00e9rieure]], [[Ourthe (d\u00e9partement)|Ourthe]], and [[Sambre-et-Meuse]].\n\n==Timeline==\n<timeline>\nDateFormat = yyyy\nImageSize

The Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge should not be confused with the Bishop's [[diocese of Li\u00e8ge]], which was larger.\n\nThe bishops of [[Li\u00e8ge]] acquired their status as a [[Prince-bishop]] between 980 and 985 when [[Notker of Li\u00e8ge|Bishop Notger]], who had been the bishop of Liege since 972, received secular control of the [[County of Huy]] from [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor]].\n\nThe Prince-Bishopric belonged from 1500 on to the [[Lower Rhenish\u2013Westphalian Circle]]. Its territory included most of the present Belgian provinces of [[Li\u00e8ge (province)|Li\u00e8ge]] and [[Limburg (Belgium)|Limburg]], and some exclaves in other parts of Belgium and the Netherlands.\n\nIt briefly became a republic (the [[Republic of Li\u00e8ge]]) from 1789 to 1791, before reverting to a Prince-Bishopric in 1791. The role of the Bishop as prince permanently ended when the state was annexed by France in 1795.  In 1815 the territories it had held became part of the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]], and in 1830 they were within the part of that kingdom which split off to become [[Belgium]].\n\nThe principality ruled by the bishops of Li\u00e8ge was never part of the [[Seventeen Provinces]] or the Spanish and Austrian [[Southern Netherlands]], but from the 16th century onwards its politics were strongly influenced by the [[duke of Burgundy|dukes of Burgundy]] and later the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburgs]].\n\nIn 1559 its 1,636 [[parish]]es were grouped into eight [[archdeacon]]ries, and twenty-eight councils, ''{{lang|fr|chr\u00e9tient\u00e9s}}'' ([[deanery|deaneries]]). The most important cities (''{{lang|fr|bonnes villes}}'') of the bishopric were: Li\u00e8ge, [[Beringen, Belgium|Beringen]], [[Bilzen]], [[Borgloon]], [[Bree, Belgium|Bree]], [[Ch\u00e2telet, Belgium|Ch\u00e2telet]], [[Ciney]], [[Couvin]], [[Dinant]], [[Fosses-la-Ville]], [[Hamont-Achel|Hamont]], [[Hasselt]], [[Herk-de-Stad]], [[Huy]], [[Maaseik]], [[Peer, Belgium|Peer]], [[Sint-Truiden]], [[Dilsen-Stokkem|Stokkem]], [[Thuin]], [[Tongeren]], [[Verviers]], [[Vis\u00e9]] and [[Waremme]].\n\nThe city of [[Maastricht]] fell under the [[condominium (international law)|joint jurisdiction]] of the Prince-Bishop of Li\u00e8ge and the [[Duchy of Brabant|Duke of Brabant]] (later the [[States-General of the Netherlands|States-General of the United Provinces]]). The second city of the prince-bishopric thus kept its ''{{lang|fr|[[status aparte]]}}'' throughout the ''{{lang|fr|ancien r\u00e9gime}}''.\n\n==Medieval prince-bishopric==\n[[File:Belgian Medieval Dioceses.png|thumb|right|This map shows the pre-1559 medieval [[Diocese of Li\u00e8ge]] (in green) which evolved from the ''{{lang|la|Civitas Tungrorum}}'' and probably had similar boundaries.]]\nThe large diocese of the medieval bishops was, until 1559, much larger than the princedom which was in their possession. However, the princely domain was gradually enlarged by donations and by acquisitions. In the 10th century, the bishops received [[secular]] power over the [[county of Huy]], which lay within of the [[diocese]]. Bishop [[Notker of Li\u00e8ge|Notger]] (972\u20131008) thus became a sovereign prince. This status was retained by his successors until the [[French Revolution]], and throughout that period of nearly eight centuries the Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge succeeded in maintaining a level of autonomy, though theoretically it was part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. This virtual independence was owed largely to the ability of its bishops, who on several occasions played an important part in international politics, being strategically positioned between [[France]] and [[Germany]], .\n\nThroughout the Middle Ages, the prince-bishopric was further expanded with the [[lords of Bouillon|lordship of Bouillon]] in 1096 (ceded to France in 1678), the acquisition of the [[county of Loon]] ({{lang-fr|Looz}}) in 1366 and the [[county of Horne]] in 1568.\n\nNotger, the founder of the principality, also rebuilt the cathedral of St Lambert, as well as the episcopal palace. He was also involved in other building activities in the city, which flourished under his rule (churches of St Paul, St. John the Evangelist, Sainte-Croix and St Denis). This bishop also strengthened the parochial organization of the city. He was one of the first church leaders to spread the observance of [[All Souls' Day]], which he authorized for his diocese. Under Notger's administration, following up on the work of Heraclius, educational institutions in Li\u00e8ge flourished. With these two bishops (and [[Wazo]]) \"The schools of Li\u00e8ge were, in fact, at that time one of the brightest literary foci of the period\". In the 11th century the city was indeed known as the ''Athens of the North''. \"Li\u00e8ge for more than a century occupied among the nations a position in regard to science which it has never recovered\". Subsequent bishops, Balderic of Looz (1008\u201318), [[Wolbodo]] (1018\u201321), Durandus (1021\u201325), Reginard (1025\u201338), Nitard (1038\u201342), the learned [[Wazo]], and Theoduin (1048\u201375), valiantly sustained the heritage of Notger. The schools formed many brilliant scholars, and gave the Catholic Church popes [[Pope Stephen IX|Stephen IX]] and [[Pope Nicholas II|Nicholas II]]. The diocese also supplied the [[University of Paris]] with a number of important doctors \u2014 [[William of Saint-Thierry]], [[Gerard of Li\u00e8ge]] and [[Godfrey of Fontaines]]. [[Alger of Li\u00e8ge]] (1055\u20131131) was an important intellectual of the period. He was first appointed deacon of [[St Bartholomew's Church, Li\u00e8ge|church of St Bartholomew]] and finally retired at the monastery of [[Cluny]].\n\nIn the reign of [[Henry of Verdun]] (1075\u201391) a tribunal was instituted (''{{lang|fr|tribunal de la paix}}'') to prevent war and enforce the [[Peace of God]]. [[Otbert of Li\u00e8ge|Otbert]] (1091\u20131119) increased the territory of the principality by purchasing the [[Lords of Bouillon|Lordship of Bouillon]]. He remained faithful to emperor [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]], who died as his guest. Henry of Namur (1119\u201321) was venerated as a martyr. During the administration of [[Alexander of Juliers]] (1128\u201334) the [[pope]], the [[Holy Roman Emperor|emperor]] and [[Bernard of Clairvaux|St Bernard]] visited Li\u00e8ge. The episcopate of [[Raoul of Zachringen]] was marked by the preaching of the reformer [[Lambert le B\u00e8gue]], who is credited with founding the [[b\u00e9guine]]s.\n\n[[Albert of Louvain]] was elected Bishop of Li\u00e8ge in 1191, but [[Emperor Henry VI]], on the pretext that the election was doubtful, gave the see to Lothair of Hochstadt. Albero's election was confirmed by the pope but in 1192, shortly after he took office, he was assassinated by three German knights at [[Reims]]. It is probable that the emperor was privy to this murder but Albero was canonized. In 1195, Albert de Cuyck (1195\u20131200) formally recognized the [[suffrage|political franchise]] of the people of Li\u00e8ge. During the 12th century, the cathedral [[chapter (religion)|chapter]], along with the bishop, assumed a more important role in the history of the principality.\n\nThe struggles between the upper and lower classes, in which the prince-bishops frequently intervened, developed through the 13th and 14th centuries, and culminate in the 15th century in the pillage and destruction of the episcopal city. In the reign of Robert of Thourotte (1240\u201346), [[Juliana of Li\u00e8ge|Saint Juliana]] \u2014 a nun of [[Cornillon Abbey]] \u2014 was led by certain visions to the project of having a feast established in honour of the [[Blessed Sacrament]]. After much hesitation, the bishop approved of her idea but death prevented the institution of the feast. The completion of the work was left to a former [[prior]] of the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] in Li\u00e8ge, [[Hugh of Saint-Cher]], who returned to the city as papal legate. In 1252 Hugh made the feast of the [[Blessed Sacrament]] an obligation throughout his diocese. John of Troyes, who, after having been archdeacon at Li\u00e8ge, was elected pope as [[Pope Urban IV|Urban IV]], encouraged the observance of the feast of [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]] in the whole Church. Another archdeacon of Li\u00e8ge became pope under the name [[Pope Gregory X|Gregory X]] and deposed the unworthy Henry of [[Gueldres]] (1247\u201374). The [[Peace of Fexhe]], signed in 1316 during the reign of [[Adolph II de la Marck (Bishop)|Adolph II de la Marck]] (1313\u201344), regulated the relations between the prince-bishop and his subjects. Nevertheless, internal discord continued and the episcopate of Arnold of [[County of Horne|Horne]] (1378\u201389) was marked by the triumph of the popular party. In 1366, the [[county of Loon]] was annexed to the bishopric.\n\n==Burgundian and Habsburg influence==\n[[File:Court concert at Li\u00e8ge.jpg|thumb|Prince-Bishop Johann Theodor of Bavaria at a court concert at Li\u00e8ge]]\n[[File:Het paleis van de prins-bisschoppen.jpg|thumb|The Archiepiscopal Palace at Li\u00e8ge]]\nUpon the death of [[Louis II of Flanders|Louis of Male]], [[count of Flanders]], in 1384, the Low Countries began their unification within the [[Burgundian Netherlands]]. Though the Principality was still nominally independent, the [[Duke of Burgundy|Dukes of Burgundy]] have had an increasing influence on its government.  [[Louis de Bourbon, Bishop of Li\u00e8ge|Louis of Bourbon]] (1456\u201382) was placed on the throne of Li\u00e8ge by the political machinations of [[Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy]]. The population resisted Burgundian rule leading to the [[Li\u00e8ge Wars]], the destruction of [[Dinant]] in 1466, and of Li\u00e8ge in 1468 by [[Charles the Bold]], marking the ending of democratic ascendancy in the Principality.\n\n[[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] completed the union of the [[Seventeen Provinces]] in the 1540s, and unofficially also controlled the principality.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chapter II: Habsburg Rule in the Netherlands |work=History of Holland |last=Edmundson |first=George |authorlink=George Edmundson |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1922 |url=http://www.authorama.com/history-of-holland-4.html |accessdate=9 June 2007 }}</ref> He nominated [[Erard de la Marck]] (1505\u201338) who brought a period of restoration. Erard was an enlightened protector of the arts. It was he who commenced the struggle against the [[Protestant Reformation|Protestant reformers]], which his successors carried forth, especially Gerard of Groesbeeck (1564\u201380). With the object of assisting in this struggle, [[Pope Paul IV|Paul IV]], by [[Papal bull|Bull]] (''{{lang|la|[[Super Universi]]}}'', 12 May 1559), created new bishoprics in the [[Low Countries]]. The new bishoprics were created largely at the expense of the diocese of Li\u00e8ge; many of its parishes were given to the dioceses of [[Diocese of Roermond|Roermond]], [[Diocese of Bois-le-Duc|'s-Hertogenbosch]], and [[Diocese of Namur|Namur]], or were added to the existing dioceses of [[Archbishopric of Mechelen-Brussels|Mechelen]] and [[Diocese of Antwerp|Antwerp]]. The number of deaneries in the diocese of Li\u00e8ge was reduced to 13.\n\nLi\u00e8ge formed the last link in the chain of Habsburg allies that made up the so-called [[Spanish Road]], a military corridor between Spanish-controlled [[Lombardy]] and the [[Spanish Netherlands]]. Completely encircled by Spanish territory, Li\u00e8ge was protected by treaties of neutrality which permitted the passage of Spanish troops through the prince-bishop's territory provided that they spent no more than two nights in one place. The importance of the prince-bishopric to Habsburg military logistics in the [[Eighty Years War]] prompted Spanish intervention foiling a Dutch invasion in 1595.<ref>{{Cite book |first=Geoffrey |last=Parker |title=The Army of Flanders and the Spanish Road, 1567\u20131659: The Logistics of Spanish Victory and Defeat in the Low Countries' Wars |location=London |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=1972 |page=61 }}</ref>\n\nMost of the bishops in the 17th century were foreigners, many of them holding several bishoprics at once. Their frequent absences gave free scope for those feuds of the [[Chiroux]] and the [[Grignoux]] to which [[Maximilian Henry of Bavaria]] ([[archbishop of Cologne]], 1650\u201388) put a stop by the Edict of 1681. In the middle of the 18th century the ideas of the French [[encyclopedist]]s began to be received at Li\u00e8ge; Bishop [[Fran\u00e7ois-Charles de Velbr\u00fcck|de Velbr\u00fcck]] (1772\u201384), encouraged their propagation and thus prepared the way for the {{lang|fr|[[Revolution Li\u00e9geoise]]}}. Partially connected with the French Revolution, a protest against the absolutist rule of prince bishop [[Cesar Constantijn Frans van Hoensbroeck]] developed into the 1789 Revolution in Li\u00e8ge. At the beginning of 1791, the revolution was crushed by troops on the orders of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nThe prince-bishopric was dissolved in 1795, when it was annexed by [[France]]. Its territory was divided over the d\u00e9partements [[Meuse-Inf\u00e9rieure]], [[Ourthe (d\u00e9partement)|Ourthe]], and [[Sambre-et-Meuse]].\n\n==Timeline==\n<timeline>\nDateFormat = yyyy\nImageSize  = width:820 height:auto barincrement:45\nPlotArea   = left:10 right:10 bottom:20 top:2\n\nColors     =\n  id:canvas      value:rgb(0.97,0.97,0.97)\n  id:grid1       value:gray(0.83)\n  id:grid2       value:gray(0.92)\n  id:Timeperiod  value:red\n  id:Timeperiod2 value:rgb(0.86,0.56,0.56)\n  id:gris        value:gray(0.7)\n  id:noir        value:black\n  id:guerre      value:red\n  id:blanc       value:white\n\nPeriod     = from:700 till:2010\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy\nScaleMajor = unit:year  increment:100 start:700 gridcolor:grid1\nScaleMinor = unit:year  increment:50  start:1050 gridcolor:grid2\nAlignBars  = justify\n\nBackgroundColors = canvas:canvas bars:canvas\n\nBarData=\n  bar:Timeperiod \n  barset:Timeperiod2\n\nPlotData=\n  width:20 fontsize:M textcolor:noir align:center\n\n  # Epochs\n  bar:Timeperiod color:Timeperiod shift:(0,0)\n  from:start till:end color:gris # Arri\u00e8re plan\n\n  from:720 till:985 text: \"Bishopric\" color:yellow shift:(0,-5)\n  from:985 till:1789 text: \"Prince-Bishopric\" color:Timeperiod2 shift:(0,-5)\n  from:1789 till:1795 color:red \n  from:1795 till:1815 color:blue\n  from:1815 till:1830 color:orange\n  from:1830 till:end  text: \"Belgium\" color:Timeperiod2 shift:(0,-5)\n\n  # Events\n  #alignement \u2192\n  width:25 fontsize:S textcolor:black anchor:from align:left color:noir\n  barset:Timeperiod2\n  from:705  till:705  text:\"705 ~[[Lambert of Maastricht|St Lambert]] killed in Li\u00e8ge\" shift:(2,3)\n  from:722  till:722  text:\"722 ~[[Saint Hubert|St Hubert]] transfers the seat of the ~Bishopric of Tongeren-Maastricht to Li\u00e8ge\" shift:(2,3)\n  from:747  till:747  text:\"ca 747 ~[[Charlemagne]] born close to Li\u00e8ge\" shift:(2,3)\n  #alignement \u2192\n  from:985  till:985  text:\"985 ~Creation of Principality\" shift:(2,3)\n  from:1366 till:1366 text:\"1366 ~[[County of Loon]] acquired\" shift:(2,3)\n  #alignement \u2190\n  from:1568 till:1568 text:\"1568 ~[[County of Horne]] acquired\" shift:(2,3)\n\n  barset:break\n  #alignement \u2190\n  width:25 fontsize:S textcolor:black anchor:from align:right color:noir\n\n  from:1789 till:1795 text:\"1789\u201395 ~[[Li\u00e8ge Revolution]]\" shift:(0,0) color:red\n  from:1795 till:1815 text:\"1795\u20131815 ~[[First French Empire|French government]]\" shift:(0,0) color:blue\n  from:1815 till:1830 text:\"1815\u201330 ~[[United Kingdom of the Netherlands|Dutch government]]\" shift:(0,0) color:orange\n  from:1830 till:1830 text:\"1830 ~[[Belgian Revolution]]\" shift:(0,0) color:red\n</timeline>\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallery\n|title=Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge\n|width=160 | height=170 | lines=4\n|align=center\n|footer=\n|File:St-Lambert-Li\u00e8ge.jpg|The martyrdom of [[Lambert of Maastricht|Saint Lambert]]\n|File:St martin01.jpg|The building of Saint Martin began 965 under the reign of Heraclius\n|File:Stavelot.Triptych.jpg|The [[Stavelot Triptych]] is an example of [[Mosan art]], [[The Morgan Library & Museum]], [[New York City]]\n|File:Pope Urban IV.jpg|Pope [[Urban IV]], [[archdeacon]] of Li\u00e8ge\n|File:Li\u00e8ge-palais-st-lambert.jpg|[[St. Lambert's Cathedral, Li\u00e8ge|St. Lambert's Cathedral]] and the palace of the Prince-Bishops (18th century)\n|File:Vermeyen-Marck.png|Portrait of [[Erard de la Marck]], by [[Jan Cornelisz Vermeyen]] (1500\u201359)\n|File:The Low Countries.png|The Prince-Bishopric enclaved in the Low Countries, 1556\u20131648\n|File:Brunnen der Drei Grazien L\u00fcttich, 2004.jpg|The ''perron'' of Li\u00e8ge stands as a symbol for the city rights acquired by the [[bourgeoisie|burghers]] from the prince-bishop\n|File:EUROPE LIEGE^ -JETON 1744-63^ a -
