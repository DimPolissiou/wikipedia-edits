The [[French East India Company]] constructed a fort on the site of Mah\u00e9 in 1724, in accordance with an accord concluded between Andr\u00e9 Mollandin and Raja Vazhunnavar of [[Vatakara]] three years earlier. In 1741, Mah\u00e9 de La Bourdonnais retook the town after a short period of occupation by the [[Maratha]]s.\n\nIn 1761 the British captured Mah\u00e9, and the settlement was handed over to the Rajah of Kadathanadu. The British restored Mah\u00e9 to the French as a part of the 1763 Treaty of Paris. In 1779, the Anglo-French war broke out, resulting in the French loss of Mah\u00e9.

In 1816 the British restored Mah\u00e9 to the French as a part of the 1814 Treaty of Paris, after the conclusion of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Mayyazhi remained under French jurisdiction as a small French colony, an enclave within [[British Raj|British India]], during the long span that began in 1816. After the [[Independence of India]] the area continued to be French-ruled until 13 June 1954, when a long anti-colonial struggle culminated in its joining the Indian Union (see [[Causes for liberation of French colonies in India]]).\n\nAfter the French left, Mah\u00e9 became a district of [[Puducherry]] Union Territory. The area of Mah\u00e9 begins from Mayyazhi puzha in the north to Azhiyoor at the south. Mah\u00e9 consists of Mah\u00e9 town and Naluthara, which includes four villages: Pandakkal, Pallur, Chalakara and Chembra. The ruler of [[Kingdom of Mysore]] from the 1760s, [[Hyder Ali]] (ca 1722\u20131782), gifted Naluthara to the French as a token of appreciation for the help they gave in opposing the British.\n\n===Liberation of Mah\u00e9===\nGandhians like [[I. K. Kumaran]] led the freedom struggle in Mahe after Indian independence in 1947. The Municipal office of the French administration was attacked{{by whom|date=December 2017}} on 21 October 1948 at 9:00 PM. The French national flag was removed and the Indian national flag hoisted on the Municipal Building (''Mairie'' in French). On 26 October, a French navy ship anchored in Mahe and the French regained control of Mahe. The ship left Mahe on 31 October. Communists tried to capture Cherukallayi enclave in April 1954. Two Indians were killed during the struggle{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}. The Indian flag was hoisted in the Naluthura enclave on 1 May.  The freedom fighters conducted an embargo on Mahe from June that year. On 14 July 1954, the Mahajanasabha organized a March into Mahe and Mahe was liberated on 16 July 1954.<ref>http://www.calicutnet.com/yourtown/mahe/history.htm</ref><ref>http://pib.nic.in/feature/feyr98/fe0898/f1808986.html</ref>\n[[File:Pondicherry pro-merger activism 1954.jpg|thumb|left|Freedom fighters in Mahe, 1954]]\n\n==Demographics==\n{{As of|2011}} India census,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.net/results/town.php?stad=A&state5=999|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040616075334/http://www.censusindia.net/results/town.php?stad=A&state5=999|archivedate=2004-06-16|title= Census of India 2001: Data from the 2001 Census, including cities, villages and towns  (Provisional)|accessdate=2008-11-01|publisher= Census Commission of India}}</ref> Mah\u00e9 had a population of 41,816, predominantly [[Malayali]]s.

Mayyazhi remained under French jurisdiction as a small French colony, an enclave within [[British Raj|British India]], during the long span that began in 1816. After the [[Independence of India]] the area continued to be French-ruled until 13 June 1954, when a long anti-colonial struggle culminated in its joining the Indian Union (see [[Causes for liberation of French colonies in India]]).\n\nAfter the French left, Mah\u00e9 became a district of [[Puducherry]] Union Territory. The area of Mah\u00e9 begins from Mayyazhi puzha in the north to Azhiyoor at the south. Mah\u00e9 consists of Mah\u00e9 town and Naluthara, which includes four villages: Pandakkal, Pallur, Chalakara and Chembra. The ruler of [[Kingdom of Mysore]] from the 1760s, [[Hyder Ali]] (ca 1722\u20131782), gifted Naluthara to the French as a token of appreciation for the help they gave in opposing the British.\n\n===Liberation of Mah\u00e9===\nGandhians like [[I. K. Kumaran]] led the freedom struggle in Mahe after Indian independence in 1947. The Municipal office of the French administration was attacked{{by whom|date=December 2017}} on 21 October 1948 at 9:00 PM. The French national flag was removed and the Indian national flag hoisted on the Municipal Building (''Mairie'' in French). On 26 October, a French navy ship anchored in Mahe and the French regained control of Mahe. The ship left Mahe on 31 October. Communists tried to capture Cherukallayi enclave in April 1954. Two Indians were killed during the struggle{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}. The Indian flag was hoisted in the Naluthura enclave on 1 May.  The freedom fighters conducted an embargo on Mahe from June that year. On 14 July 1954, the Mahajanasabha organized a March into Mahe and Mahe was liberated on 16 July 1954.<ref>http://www.calicutnet.com/yourtown/mahe/history.htm</ref><ref>http://pib.nic.in/feature/feyr98/fe0898/f1808986.html</ref>\n[[File:Pondicherry pro-merger activism 1954.jpg|thumb|left|Freedom fighters in Mahe, 1954]]\n\n==Demographics==\n{{As of|2011}} India census,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.net/results/town.php?stad=A&state5=999|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040616075334/http://www.censusindia.net/results/town.php?stad=A&state5=999|archivedate=2004-06-16|title= Census of India 2001: Data from the 2001 Census, including cities, villages and towns  (Provisional)|accessdate=2008-11-01|publisher= Census Commission of India}}</ref> Mah\u00e9 had a population of 41,816, predominantly [[Malayali]]s.

However, [[Toronto Community Housing Corporation|Toronto Community Housing]], the second largest public housing agency in North America, has a variety of buildings and communities ranging from individual houses to townhouse communities and mid-rise and high-rise apartments in both working-class and middle-class neighborhoods that house a significant number of low-income Canadians.\n\nFollowing the decentralisation of public housing to local municipalities, [[Social Housing Services Corporation]] (SHSC) was created in the [[Province of Ontario]] in 2002 to provide group services for social housing providers (public housing, [[non-profit housing]] and [[co-operative housing]]). It is a non-profit corporation which provides Ontario housing providers and service managers with bulk purchasing, insurance, investment and information services that add significant value to their operations.\n\nRecently,{{When|date=February 2020}} there has been a move toward the integration of public housing with market housing and other uses.

Moreover, public housing, along with the [[Federal-aid highway program|Federal Highway Program]], demolished the older, substandard housing of communities of color across the United States.\n\nHowever, the advent of makeshift tent communities during the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] caused concern in the Administration. Public housing in its earliest decades was usually much more working-class and middle-class and white than it was by the 1970s. Many Americans associate large, multi-story towers with public housing, but early projects were actually low-rise, though [[Le Corbusier]] [[city block|superblock]]s caught on before World War II.\n\nA unique US public housing initiative was the development of subsidized middle-class housing during the late [[New Deal]] (1940\u201342) under the auspices of the [[Mutual Ownership Defense Housing Division]] of the [[Federal Works Agency]] under the direction of [[Colonel Lawrence Westbrook]]. These eight projects were purchased by the residents after the Second World War and as of 2009 seven of the projects continue to operate as [[Housing cooperative|mutual housing corporations]] owned by their residents. These projects are among the very few definitive success stories in the history of the US public housing effort.\n\nPublic housing was only built with the blessing of the local government, and projects were almost never built on suburban [[greenfield land|greenfields]], but through regeneration of older neighborhoods. The destruction of [[tenement]]s and eviction of their low-income residents consistently created problems in nearby neighborhoods with \"soft\" real estate markets. Houses, apartments or other residential units are usually subsidized on a rent-geared-to-income (RGI) basis. Some communities have now embraced a mixed income, with both assisted and market rents, when allocating homes as they become available.\n\nThe federal [[Housing and Urban Development]] (HUD) department's 1993 [[HOPE VI]] program addressed concerns of distressed properties and blighted superblocks with revitalization and funding projects for the renewal of public housing to decrease its density and allow for tenants with mixed income levels.<ref name=\"$4billiongrants\">{{cite web |url= http://www.newurbannews.com/hopeVI.html|title= Hope VI funds new urban neighborhoods|accessdate=16 November 2011 |work=New Urban News |date= January 2002}}</ref><ref name=\"HUDpressrelease\">{{cite web|url= http://portal.hud.gov/portal/page/portal/HUD/press/press_releases_media_advisories/2010/HUDNo.10-112|title= HUDNo.10-112/U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)|accessdate= 16 November 2011|publisher= [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development|HUD]]|date= June 2010|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100714075225/http://portal.hud.gov/portal/page/portal/HUD/press/press_releases_media_advisories/2010/HUDNo.10-112|archivedate= 14 July 2010|df= dmy-all}}</ref> Projects continue to have a reputation for violence, drug use, and prostitution, especially in [[New Orleans]], New York City, [[Philadelphia]], Los Angeles, Chicago, and Washington, D.C. as well as others leading to the passage of a 1996 federal \"[[one strike you're out]]\" law, enabling the eviction of tenants convicted of crimes, especially drug-related, or merely as a result of being tried for some crimes.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/04/us/04cncfirststrike.html Application of First Strike Policy Is Questioned] By ANGELA CAPUTO, New York Times, 3 September 2011</ref>\n\nOther attempts to solve these problems include the 1974<ref>1974 Housing and Community Development Act</ref> [[Section 8 (housing)|Section 8]] Housing Program, which encourages the private sector to construct affordable homes, and subsidized public housing.

The residents were mainly working-class families with several children. The apartments had an average of five people per room, sometimes up to eight. The tiny apartments were equipped with running water, a pantry and an attic cupboard. Every apartment had its own toilet in the cellar. Electric lighting was installed in 1918.\n\nThe homes and lives of worker families in Helsinki from 1909 to 1985 are presented in a museum near the {{lang|fi|Linnanm\u00e4ki|italic=no}} amusement park.\n\n=== France ===\n{{Main|Public housing in France|HLM}}\n[[File:Paris13 HBM-rueJeanFautrier.jpg|thumb|Public housing of the {{lang|fr|rue Jean Fautrier}} in the [[13th arrondissement of Paris]].|alt=]]\n\nAfter [[World War II]], the population increased at a rate previously unknown, the rural exodus increased, while war damage had reduced the number of houses in many cities. Rental prices dramatically rose, and the government made a law in 1948 to block them, effectively ending the economic benefits of housing investment. Rents were gradually deregulated until debate in the 1980s led to the current rental law of 1989 theoretically balancing landlord and tenant relations. However, there was a major homelessness crisis in the winter of 1953\u20134 and the necessary laws were gradually mobilized producing high levels of construction almost continuously from the 1960s. Social landlords were a major source of expertise as well as construction actors with links to national and local bodies.<ref name=\"Jean-Marc St\u00e9b\u00e9 1998\">{{cite book |author=Jean-Marc St\u00e9b\u00e9 |date=1998 |title=Le logement social en France |trans-title=Social housing in France |location=Paris |publisher=[[Presses Universitaires de France]] }}</ref> The construction industry was at the time inadequate so political support was needed\n\nIt is incorrect to refer to French social housing as public housing.

The state had the funds and [[eminent domain|the legal means to acquire the land]] and could provide some advantages to the companies that then built its huge housing complexes of hundreds of apartments. Quality was also effectively regulated, resulting in decent or even top quality housing for the standard of the 1950s and 1960s. The construction of HLMs were subject to much political debate. Much smaller developments are now the norm. This housing is now generally referred to as {{lang|fr|l'habitat social}}, a slightly wider sphere than just housing.\n\nFrance still retains this system, a recent law making it an obligation for every town to have at least 20% HLM. Nowadays HLM represents roughly half of the rental market (46% in 2006).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/donnees_chiffrees.pdf |title=Quelques donn\u00e9es chiffr\u00e9es sur le parc locatif priv\u00e9 |trans-title=Some data on the private rental market |accessdate=22 November 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603095252/http://www.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/donnees_chiffrees.pdf |archivedate=3 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Social housing is not all for disadvantaged people who are just one of the target groups.

These housing estates ({{lang|de|Siedlungen}}), were made necessary by the dreadful living conditions of pre-war urban tenements.  The right to healthy housing was written into the 1919 [[Weimar Constitution]], but few homes were built until the economy stabilised in 1925.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nThe new German housing estates were low-rise, no more than five stories, and in suburban settings.  Residents were provided access to light, air, and sun.  The size, shape, orientation and architectural style of Germany's public housing were informed by the recent experience of the Viennese, the Dutch, the anti-urban [[Garden City Movement]] in Britain, the new industrialized mass-production and pre-fabrication building techniques, the novel use of steel and glass, and by the progressive-liberal policies of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]].{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nIn 1930 in the industrial city of {{lang|de|[[Dessau]]|italic=no}}, the {{lang|de|[[Laubengangh\u00e4user]]}} ('Houses with Balcony Access') were designed by [[Bauhaus]] director {{lang|de|[[Hannes Meyer]]|italic=no}} for a [[housing cooperative]] that wanted apartments it could let for no more than a quarter of the occupant's income.

[[Dublin Corporation]] and the former [[Dublin County Council]] provided the lion's share of Irish local authority housing, with [[County Longford]] having the largest ratio of local authority to private housing in the state. The government has promoted tenant purchase on favourable terms, and many former social housing areas are now completely or almost completely privately owned. Housing associations now play a significant role in social housing provision. As the Irish state's ability to borrow is diminished government policy favours an increased role for private financing of housing associations instead of capital grants for local authorities.\n\n=== Netherlands ===\n\nIn the [[Netherlands]], the rent for the cheaper rental homes is kept low through governmental oversight and regulation. These types of homes are known as {{lang|nl|sociale huurwoningen}}.\n\nIn practice this is accomplished by non-profit private housing foundations or associations ({{lang|nl|toegelaten instellingen}}). Due to frequent mergers the number of these organizations dropped to around 430 by 2009. They manage 2.4&nbsp;million dwellings. The majority of the low-rent apartments in the Netherlands are owned by such organisations. Since the policy changed in 1995 the social housing organizations have become financially independent, focusing on their role as social entrepreneurs. In most Dutch municipalities there came to exist a certain minimum capacity of social housing throughout the last decades. In many cities such as [[Amsterdam]], [[The Hague]], [[Rotterdam]] and [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] the percentage of social housing approaches or even passes 50 percent. The public (financial) supervision is done by the central fund for housing ({{lang|nl|Centraal Fonds Volkshuisvesting}}).\n\nThe Dutch housing policy is based on a concept of universal access to affordable housing for all and the prevention of segregation.\n\n=== Romania ===\n{{Main|Systematization (Romania)}}\n[[File:2017 Victory Square, Bucharest.jpg|thumb|Government built housing in [[Bucharest]], Romania.|alt=]]\n\nThe skyline of many Romanian cities became dominated by standardized apartment blocks under the former communist government's policy of tower bloc construction.

Unlike its counterparts in Great Britain, for instance, the Swedish Public Housing has never had any income restrictions.

Although not carrying out house-building nor acquisition projects in recent times, the policies lead to a ubiquitous presence of publicly-owned buildings throughout the cities of Sweden, including attractive urban areas, with a rather wide range of income among the tenants.\n\nPolicies carried out in the Swedish cities throughout the first decade of the 21st century have led to the tenants of public housing having bought the publicly owned buildings in which they live, which in turn has led to a significant decrease of publicly owned buildings in attractive urban areas, subsequently leading to an increased development of processes related to gentrification.\n\n=== Slovakia ===\n{{Further|Panel\u00e1k}}\n[[File:Sidlisko tahanovce 05.jpg|thumb|258x258px|[[S\u00eddlisko \u0164ahanovce]] in [[Ko\u0161ice]], [[Slovakia]].]]\n[[File:Towns14Slovakia323.JPG|thumb|240x240px|Central area of S\u00eddlisko II in [[Pre\u0161ov]], [[Slovakia]].|alt=]]\nForms of housing projects may vary in [[Slovakia]]. In Slovakia, [[s\u00eddlisko]] basically means housing project in English. During the [[Communist era of Czechoslovakia|communist era]] a construction of large [[Housing estate|housing estates]] was an important part of building plans in the former [[Czechoslovakia]] (now [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]]). The government wanted to provide large quantities of [[affordable housing]] and to slash costs by employing uniform designs over the whole country. They also sought to foster a \"collectivist nature\" in people. In Slovakian housing projects, there's usually a mix of [[Social class|social classes]], generally [[working class]] and somewhat [[middle class]]. These housing projects aren't necessarily bad, and actually remain as great homes to certain people. Unlike the [[United States]] or some other countries, in Slovakia, housing projects are usually and can be run by [[Housing cooperative|housing cooperatives]], [[Housing authority|authorities]], [[Municipality|municipalities]], self-governing non-profit organizations and/or through [[Public\u2013private partnership|public-private partnership]] and such. Or they are owned by a mixture of all of them or some of them. Slovakian housing projects basically work like [[subsidized housing]] or [[Section 8 (housing)|Section 8]] in the US, because it's usually based on rent controls by private landlords, and not by housing authorities and such. Most buildings in Slovakian housing estates are so called \"[[Panel\u00e1k|panel\u00e1ks]]\", a [[colloquial]] term in [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]] for a [[panel building]] constructed of pre-fabricated, [[pre-stressed concrete]], such as those extant in the former [[Czechoslovakia]] and elsewhere in the world. Also, it's good to mention that [[Slovaks]] don't really use terms like \"public housing\" or \"social housing\", they usually just say \"[[housing estate]]\" ([[s\u00eddlisko]]) in their language. Large housing estates of concrete panel buildings (panel\u00e1ks) now dominate the streets of [[Bratislava]], [[Ko\u0161ice]] and other towns.

Moreover, public housing, along with the [[Federal-aid highway program|Federal Highway Program]], demolished the older, substandard housing of communities of color across the United States.\n\nHowever, the advent of makeshift tent communities during the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] caused concern in the Administration. Public housing in its earliest decades was usually much more working-class and middle-class and white than it was by the 1970s. Many Americans associate large, multi-story towers with public housing, but early projects were actually low-rise, though [[Le Corbusier]] [[city block|superblock]]s caught on before World War II.\n\nA unique US public housing initiative was the development of subsidized middle-class housing during the late [[New Deal]] (1940\u201342) under the auspices of the [[Mutual Ownership Defense Housing Division]] of the [[Federal Works Agency]] under the direction of [[Colonel Lawrence Westbrook]]. These eight projects were purchased by the residents after the Second World War and as of 2009 seven of the projects continue to operate as [[Housing cooperative|mutual housing corporations]] owned by their residents. These projects are among the very few definitive success stories in the history of the US public housing effort.\n\nPublic housing was only built with the blessing of the local government, and projects were almost never built on suburban [[greenfield land|greenfields]], but through regeneration of older neighborhoods. The destruction of [[tenement]]s and eviction of their low-income residents consistently created problems in nearby neighborhoods with \"soft\" real estate markets. Houses, apartments or other residential units are usually subsidized on a rent-geared-to-income (RGI) basis. Some communities have now embraced a mixed income, with both assisted and market rents, when allocating homes as they become available.\n\nThe federal [[Housing and Urban Development]] (HUD) department's 1993 [[HOPE VI]] program addressed concerns of distressed properties and blighted superblocks with revitalization and funding projects for the renewal of public housing to decrease its density and allow for tenants with mixed income levels.<ref name=\"$4billiongrants\">{{cite web |url= http://www.newurbannews.com/hopeVI.html|title= Hope VI funds new urban neighborhoods|accessdate=16 November 2011 |work=New Urban News |date= January 2002}}</ref><ref name=\"HUDpressrelease\">{{cite web|url= http://portal.hud.gov/portal/page/portal/HUD/press/press_releases_media_advisories/2010/HUDNo.10-112|title= HUDNo.10-112/U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)|accessdate= 16 November 2011|publisher= [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development|HUD]]|date= June 2010|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100714075225/http://portal.hud.gov/portal/page/portal/HUD/press/press_releases_media_advisories/2010/HUDNo.10-112|archivedate= 14 July 2010|df= dmy-all}}</ref> Projects continue to have a reputation for violence, drug use, and prostitution, especially in [[New Orleans]], New York City, [[Philadelphia]], Los Angeles, Chicago, and Washington, D.C. as well as others leading to the passage of a 1996 federal \"[[one strike you're out]]\" law, enabling the eviction of tenants convicted of crimes, especially drug-related, or merely as a result of being tried for some crimes.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/04/us/04cncfirststrike.html Application of First Strike Policy Is Questioned] By ANGELA CAPUTO, New York Times, 3 September 2011</ref>\n\nOther attempts to solve these problems include the 1974<ref>1974 Housing and Community Development Act</ref> [[Section 8 (housing)|Section 8]] Housing Program, which encourages the private sector to construct affordable homes, and subsidized public housing.

By law, the municipalities have access to 25% of the rentals, usually reserving them for the poor, the unemployed, the disabled or mentally ill or any other group dependent on social benefits from the municipality. Over the years, these regulations have created many 'especially vulnerable residential areas' \u2013 so called \"ghettos\" \u2013 within the country. Danish public housing has never had any income restrictions, but in recent years new state regulations has made it mandatory for several of them to favor fully employed renters and disfavor unemployed or part-time employed people. This is a relatively new effort by the state to counter the ghettoisation, which is now an officially recognized problem countrywide.<ref name=FactSheet/><ref name=retsinformation/>\n\nAs in Sweden, state and municipal policies carried out throughout the first decade of the 21st century, has led to an increased privatization of public housing. In many areas, residents have been offered to buy their own flats, thereby effectively changing the status of the property.

The residents were mainly working-class families with several children. The apartments had an average of five people per room, sometimes up to eight. The tiny apartments were equipped with running water, a pantry and an attic cupboard. Every apartment had its own toilet in the cellar. Electric lighting was installed in 1918.\n\nThe homes and lives of worker families in Helsinki from 1909 to 1985 are presented in a museum near the {{lang|fi|Linnanm\u00e4ki|italic=no}} amusement park.\n\n=== France ===\n{{Main|Public housing in France|HLM}}\n[[File:Paris13 HBM-rueJeanFautrier.jpg|thumb|Public housing of the {{lang|fr|rue Jean Fautrier}} in the [[13th arrondissement of Paris]].|alt=]]\n\nAfter [[World War II]], the population increased at a rate previously unknown, the rural exodus increased, while war damage had reduced the number of houses in many cities. Rental prices dramatically rose, and the government made a law in 1948 to block them, effectively ending the economic benefits of housing investment. Rents were gradually deregulated until debate in the 1980s led to the current rental law of 1989 theoretically balancing landlord and tenant relations. However, there was a major homelessness crisis in the winter of 1953\u20134 and the necessary laws were gradually mobilized producing high levels of construction almost continuously from the 1960s. Social landlords were a major source of expertise as well as construction actors with links to national and local bodies.<ref name=\"Jean-Marc St\u00e9b\u00e9 1998\">{{cite book |author=Jean-Marc St\u00e9b\u00e9 |date=1998 |title=Le logement social en France |trans-title=Social housing in France |location=Paris |publisher=[[Presses Universitaires de France]] }}</ref> The construction industry was at the time inadequate so political support was needed\n\nIt is incorrect to refer to French social housing as public housing.

Public housing companies followed before World War I.<ref name=\"Jean-Marc St\u00e9b\u00e9 1998\"/> There are still different social housing movements, public, private and some cooperative.

The state had the funds and [[eminent domain|the legal means to acquire the land]] and could provide some advantages to the companies that then built its huge housing complexes of hundreds of apartments. Quality was also effectively regulated, resulting in decent or even top quality housing for the standard of the 1950s and 1960s. The construction of HLMs were subject to much political debate. Much smaller developments are now the norm. This housing is now generally referred to as {{lang|fr|l'habitat social}}, a slightly wider sphere than just housing.\n\nFrance still retains this system, a recent law making it an obligation for every town to have at least 20% HLM. Nowadays HLM represents roughly half of the rental market (46% in 2006).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/donnees_chiffrees.pdf |title=Quelques donn\u00e9es chiffr\u00e9es sur le parc locatif priv\u00e9 |trans-title=Some data on the private rental market |accessdate=22 November 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603095252/http://www.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/donnees_chiffrees.pdf |archivedate=3 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Social housing is not all for disadvantaged people who are just one of the target groups.

This has not had the hoped for results. It has also been sought to resolve the problem of access to the system by disadvantaged people by a new system where certain groups can apply to court to be housed if refused, the \"right to housing\".

These housing estates ({{lang|de|Siedlungen}}), were made necessary by the dreadful living conditions of pre-war urban tenements.  The right to healthy housing was written into the 1919 [[Weimar Constitution]], but few homes were built until the economy stabilised in 1925.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nThe new German housing estates were low-rise, no more than five stories, and in suburban settings.  Residents were provided access to light, air, and sun.  The size, shape, orientation and architectural style of Germany's public housing were informed by the recent experience of the Viennese, the Dutch, the anti-urban [[Garden City Movement]] in Britain, the new industrialized mass-production and pre-fabrication building techniques, the novel use of steel and glass, and by the progressive-liberal policies of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]].{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nIn 1930 in the industrial city of {{lang|de|[[Dessau]]|italic=no}}, the {{lang|de|[[Laubengangh\u00e4user]]}} ('Houses with Balcony Access') were designed by [[Bauhaus]] director {{lang|de|[[Hannes Meyer]]|italic=no}} for a [[housing cooperative]] that wanted apartments it could let for no more than a quarter of the occupant's income.

[[Dublin Corporation]] and the former [[Dublin County Council]] provided the lion's share of Irish local authority housing, with [[County Longford]] having the largest ratio of local authority to private housing in the state. The government has promoted tenant purchase on favourable terms, and many former social housing areas are now completely or almost completely privately owned. Housing associations now play a significant role in social housing provision. As the Irish state's ability to borrow is diminished government policy favours an increased role for private financing of housing associations instead of capital grants for local authorities.\n\n=== Netherlands ===\n\nIn the [[Netherlands]], the rent for the cheaper rental homes is kept low through governmental oversight and regulation. These types of homes are known as {{lang|nl|sociale huurwoningen}}.\n\nIn practice this is accomplished by non-profit private housing foundations or associations ({{lang|nl|toegelaten instellingen}}). Due to frequent mergers the number of these organizations dropped to around 430 by 2009. They manage 2.4&nbsp;million dwellings. The majority of the low-rent apartments in the Netherlands are owned by such organisations. Since the policy changed in 1995 the social housing organizations have become financially independent, focusing on their role as social entrepreneurs. In most Dutch municipalities there came to exist a certain minimum capacity of social housing throughout the last decades. In many cities such as [[Amsterdam]], [[The Hague]], [[Rotterdam]] and [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] the percentage of social housing approaches or even passes 50 percent. The public (financial) supervision is done by the central fund for housing ({{lang|nl|Centraal Fonds Volkshuisvesting}}).\n\nThe Dutch housing policy is based on a concept of universal access to affordable housing for all and the prevention of segregation.\n\n=== Romania ===\n{{Main|Systematization (Romania)}}\n[[File:2017 Victory Square, Bucharest.jpg|thumb|Government built housing in [[Bucharest]], Romania.|alt=]]\n\nThe skyline of many Romanian cities became dominated by standardized apartment blocks under the former communist government's policy of tower bloc construction.

Unlike its counterparts in Great Britain, for instance, the Swedish Public Housing has never had any income restrictions.

Although not carrying out house-building nor acquisition projects in recent times, the policies lead to a ubiquitous presence of publicly-owned buildings throughout the cities of Sweden, including attractive urban areas, with a rather wide range of income among the tenants.\n\nPolicies carried out in the Swedish cities throughout the first decade of the 21st century have led to the tenants of public housing having bought the publicly owned buildings in which they live, which in turn has led to a significant decrease of publicly owned buildings in attractive urban areas, subsequently leading to an increased development of processes related to gentrification.\n\n=== Slovakia ===\n{{Further|Panel\u00e1k}}\n[[File:Sidlisko tahanovce 05.jpg|thumb|258x258px|[[S\u00eddlisko \u0164ahanovce]] in [[Ko\u0161ice]], [[Slovakia]].]]\n[[File:Towns14Slovakia323.JPG|thumb|240x240px|Central area of S\u00eddlisko II in [[Pre\u0161ov]], [[Slovakia]].|alt=]]\nForms of housing projects may vary in [[Slovakia]]. In Slovakia, [[s\u00eddlisko]] basically means housing project in English. During the [[Communist era of Czechoslovakia|communist era]] a construction of large [[Housing estate|housing estates]] was an important part of building plans in the former [[Czechoslovakia]] (now [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]]). The government wanted to provide large quantities of [[affordable housing]] and to slash costs by employing uniform designs over the whole country. They also sought to foster a \"collectivist nature\" in people. In Slovakian housing projects, there's usually a mix of [[Social class|social classes]], generally [[working class]] and somewhat [[middle class]]. These housing projects aren't necessarily bad, and actually remain as great homes to certain people. Unlike the [[United States]] or some other countries, in Slovakia, housing projects are usually and can be run by [[Housing cooperative|housing cooperatives]], [[Housing authority|authorities]], [[Municipality|municipalities]], self-governing non-profit organizations and/or through [[Public\u2013private partnership|public-private partnership]] and such. Or they are owned by a mixture of all of them or some of them. Slovakian housing projects basically work like [[subsidized housing]] or [[Section 8 (housing)|Section 8]] in the US, because it's usually based on rent controls by private landlords, and not by housing authorities and such. Most buildings in Slovakian housing estates are so called \"[[Panel\u00e1k|panel\u00e1ks]]\", a [[colloquial]] term in [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]] for a [[panel building]] constructed of pre-fabricated, [[pre-stressed concrete]], such as those extant in the former [[Czechoslovakia]] and elsewhere in the world. Also, it's good to mention that [[Slovaks]] don't really use terms like \"public housing\" or \"social housing\", they usually just say \"[[housing estate]]\" ([[s\u00eddlisko]]) in their language. Large housing estates of concrete panel buildings (panel\u00e1ks) now dominate the streets of [[Bratislava]], [[Ko\u0161ice]] and other towns.

It also introduced the [[Decent Homes Standard|Decent Homes]] programme, a capital fund to bring social housing up to a modern physical standard.

{"title_page": "Colorado Silver Boom", "text_new": "[[File: Matchless Mine.JPG|thumb|300px|The Matchless Mine in Leadville, originally owned by [[Horace Tabor]], aka \"The Silver King\".]]\n\nThe '''Colorado Silver Boom''' was a dramatic expansionist period of [[silver]] [[mining]] activity in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Colorado]] in the late 19th century. The boom started in 1879 with the discovery of silver at [[Leadville, Colorado|Leadville]]. Over 82 million dollars worth of silver was mined during the period, making it the second great mineral boom in the state, and coming twenty years after the earlier and shorter [[Colorado Gold Rush]] of 1859.  The boom was largely the consequence of large-scale purchases of silver by the [[Federal government of the United States|United States Government]] authorized by [[United States Congress|Congress]] in 1878. The boom endured throughout the 1880s, resulting in an intense increase in both the population and wealth of Colorado, especially in the mountains.  It came to an end in 1893 in the wake of the collapse of silver prices caused by the repeal of [[Sherman Silver Purchase Act]].<ref name=Voynick>Voynick, S.M., 1992, Colorado Gold, Missoula: Mountain Press Publishing Company, {{ISBN|0878424555}}</ref>{{rp|61\u201362}}\n\nSilver had been discovered in Colorado in the 1860s, with early mining in [[Clear Creek Canyon]] at [[Georgetown, Colorado|Georgetown]] in 1864. In the early days, the mineral was overshadowed by gold, however, and the low price of mineral meant that most mines were not profitable enough to operate. In 1878, responding to pressure from western interests, the United States Congress passed the [[Bland\u2013Allison Act]] authorizing the free coinage of silver. The government demand raised the price of the metal to the point where many additional mines were profitable. The discovery of the Leadville district the following year resulted in a flood of new emigrant prospectors to many of the same mountain gullies that had been the site of the gold rush. The resulting opulence was most lavish in Leadville itself.  The repeal of the Sherman Act in 1893 conversely led to a collapse of silver prices, bringing out an end to the boom as well.\n\n[[File:Creede, Bachelor Loop mine.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Old mine in Creede, Colorado]]\n\nBeginning in 1889, [[Creede, Colorado]] was the site of another big silver boom.\nThe first discovery was made at the Alpha mine in 1869, but the silver could not be extracted at a profit from the complex ores. The great \u201cBoom Days\u201d started with the discovery of rich minerals in Willow Creek Canyon. The town leapt from a population of 600 in 1889 to more than 10,000 people in December 1891.

The boom also drove many extensions of the railway network in the mountains, including such lines as the [[Denver, South Park, and Pacific Railroad|Denver, South Park, and Pacific]], which built an early [[narrow-gauge railway|narrow-gauge]] line to Leadville. Likewise, the extension of the railroad network up the [[Roaring Fork River|Roaring Fork Valley]] to the previously failed mining town of [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]] in the late 1880s made the extraction of silver ore there economically feasible, and saved the town from near extinction.\n\nThe government purchases of silver were subsequently nearly doubled by the 1890 Sherman Silver Purchase Act, further extending the boom into the early 1890s.  The repeal of the actin 1893 resulted in a collapse of silver prices, bringing about an end to the boom. After 1893, many mining camps became [[ghost town]]s. The accompanying collapse in statewide economic activity was ameliorated somewhat by the simultaneous emergence of agriculture, previously derided as not feasible, as a large component of the state economy.\n\nThe working conditions inside the mines were often very dangerous.

The boom started in 1879 with the discovery of silver at [[Leadville, Colorado|Leadville]]. Over 82 million dollars worth of silver was mined during the period, making it the second great mineral boom in the state, and coming twenty years after the earlier and shorter [[Colorado Gold Rush]] of 1859.  The boom was largely the consequence of large-scale purchases of silver by the [[Federal government of the United States|United States Government]] authorized by [[United States Congress|Congress]] in 1878. The boom endured throughout the 1880s, resulting in an intense increase in both the population and wealth of Colorado, especially in the mountains.  It came to an end in 1893 in the wake of the collapse of silver prices caused by the repeal of [[Sherman Silver Purchase Act]].<ref name=Voynick>Voynick, S.M., 1992, Colorado Gold, Missoula: Mountain Press Publishing Company, {{ISBN|0878424555}}</ref>{{rp|61\u201362}}\n\nSilver had been discovered in Colorado in the 1860s, with early mining in [[Clear Creek Canyon]] at [[Georgetown, Colorado|Georgetown]] in 1864. In the early days, the mineral was overshadowed by gold, however, and the low price of mineral meant that most mines were not profitable enough to operate. In 1878, responding to pressure from western interests, the United States Congress passed the [[Bland\u2013Allison Act]] authorizing the free coinage of silver. The government demand raised the price of the metal to the point where many additional mines were profitable. The discovery of the Leadville district the following year resulted in a flood of new emigrant prospectors to many of the same mountain gullies that had been the site of the gold rush. The resulting opulence was most lavish in Leadville itself.  The repeal of the Sherman Act in 1893 conversely led to a collapse of silver prices, bringing out an end to the boom as well.\n\n[[File:Creede, Bachelor Loop mine.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Old mine in Creede, Colorado]]\n\nBeginning in 1889, [[Creede, Colorado]] was the site of another big silver boom.\nThe first discovery was made at the Alpha mine in 1869, but the silver could not be extracted at a profit from the complex ores. The great \u201cBoom Days\u201d started with the discovery of rich minerals in Willow Creek Canyon. The town leapt from a population of 600 in 1889 to more than 10,000 people in December 1891. The mines operated continuously until 1995.  Creede was the last silver boom town in Colorado in the 19th century.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Williams Jr.|first=Albert|title=Creede, A New Mining Camp|journal=The Engineering Magazine|volume=III|issue=3|pages=324\u2013339|publisher=McGraw Hill Publishing Co.|location=New York, NY|date=June 1892|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DkQAAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA325#|accessdate=May 16, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title=Congress and Silver|journal=The Illustrated American|volume=X|issue=108|pages=158|date=March 12, 1893|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JwvnAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA158#|accessdate=May 16, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title=Creede, the New Mining Town of Colorado|journal=Scientific American|volume=LXVI|issue=13|pages=196\u2013197|publisher=Munn & Co.|location=New York, NY|date=March 26, 1892|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FdIxAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA196#|accessdate=May 16, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Frank|title=History of the State of Colorado|publisher=The Blakely Printing Company|volume=IV|year=1895|location=Chicago, IL|pages=223\u2013225|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xZlQAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA223#|accessdate=May 16, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=Creede Is A Lively Town: Thousands Rush In For Sale Of Lands|newspaper=New York Times|date=February 27, 1892|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1892/02/27/106806911.pdf|accessdate=May 16, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title=Creede, the New Mining Town of Colorado|journal=Scientific American|volume=LXVI|issue=13|pages=196\u2013197|publisher=Munn & Company|location=New York, NY|date=March 26, 1892|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JoU9AQAAIAAJ&pg=PA196#|accessdate=May 17, 2012}}</ref>\n<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Creede|journal=The Colorado Magazine|volume=1|issue=2|pages=163\u2013172|publisher=The Colorado Publishing Co.|location=Denver, CO|date=May 1893|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=00NOAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA163#|accessdate=May 16, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|editor-last=Hall|editor-first= Henry|title=America's Successful Men of Affairs (entry for Nicholas C.

The boom also drove many extensions of the railway network in the mountains, including such lines as the [[Denver, South Park and Pacific Railroad|Denver, South Park and Pacific]], which built an early [[narrow-gauge railway|narrow-gauge]] line to Leadville. Likewise the extension of the railroad network up the [[Roaring Fork River|Roaring Fork Valley]] to the previously failed mining town of [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]] in the late 1880s made the extraction of silver ore there economically feasible, and saved the town from near extinction.\n\nThe government purchases of silver were subsequently nearly doubled by the 1890 Sherman Silver Purchase Act, further extending the boom into the early 1890s.  The repeal of the act in 1893 resulted in a collapse of silver prices, bringing about an end to the boom. After 1893, many mining camps became [[ghost town]]s. The accompanying collapse in statewide economic activity was ameliorated somewhat by the simultaneous emergence of agriculture, previously derided as not feasible, as a large component of the state economy.\n\nThe working conditions inside the mines were often very dangerous. [[Silicosis]]  which, at the time, was incurable, ruined miners' lungs quickly. Many other hazards existed. Apart from the lanterns or tallow candles the miners carried, the mines were otherwise completely dark. Miners at the time were also subject to the threat of tunnel collapse, flooding and the lack of oxygen in the deeper areas of the mines.

Some scholars objected to the participation of women, but Muhammad Ilyas slowly gained their support and the first ''jamaat'' of women was formed in Nizamuddin, Delhi.<ref name=womenbm/> Accompanied by a close male relative, (\u0645\u062d\u0631\u0645), that is husband, brother, father or son, women are encouraged to go out in jamaats and work among other women and family members while following the rules of modesty, seclusion and segregation. They observe strict rules of hijab by covering their faces and hands.<ref name=daily/><ref name=womenbm/> ''Jamaats'' of women sometimes participate in large annual meetings; otherwise, they commonly hold neighbourhood meetings. Since South Asian Islamic culture discourages women from going to the mosque and saintly shrines, these venues offer an opportunity for women to pray together and congregate religiously.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\nIn many modern Islamist movements, women have been relegated to a domestic role. Tablighi Jamaat tends to blur the boundaries of gender roles and both genders share a common behavioural model and their commitment to tabligh. The emphasis is on a common nature and responsibilities shared by both genders. Just as men redraw the gender roles when they wash and cook during the course of ''da'wa'' tours, women undertake the male responsibility of sustaining the household.<ref name=womenbm/> Women do not play any role in the higher echelons of the movement,<ref name=daily/> but their opinions are taken into due considerations. Women and the family members are being to told to learn Quran and follow 5 Amaals in every day life, Taleem of Ahadees, Quran recitation,6 Points muzakera, and mashwara for daily life work and fikr for the whole world as people from around the world will be coming and they are the one who has to learn before they teach.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\n==Controversies==\n[[File:Cot Goh.jpg|thumb|Mushawara after Bayan Subh at Tablighi Jamaat center in Cot Goh, [[Montasik]], [[Aceh Besar]], [[Aceh]]]]\n\n===Criticism===\nDue to the orthodox nature of Tablighi Jamaat, they have been criticised for being retrogressive. The women in the movement observe complete [[hijab]] for which the Tablighi Jamaat is accused of keeping women \"strictly subservient and second string\".<ref name=daily/>\n\nTablighi Jamaat has also been criticised within Islamic circles and the major opposition in the Indian subcontinent comes from the [[Barelvi]] movement. One of the main criticisms against them is that the men neglect and ignore their families, especially by going out on ''da'wa'' tours. Tablighi Jamaat participants, in response, argue that both genders should be equally engaged in Tabligh. They further say that women, like men, are also urged to carry the responsibility of Tabligh and that men should facilitate women's participation by providing childcare.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\nMany critics, especially those from [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] and [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]], criticise Tabligh Jamaat for their neutral political stance. They say that Islamist forces, during their conflicts with secular or non-Islamist opponents, could have been helped by Tablighi Jamaat followers. Specifically they criticise the Tabligh Jamaat's neutral position towards issues in South Asia such as the introduction of an [[Constitution of Pakistan of 1956|Islamic constitution in Pakistan]] (1950s), Islam vs Socialism (1969\u20131971), communal riots in India in the 1970s and 1980s, the Khatm-e-Nabuwwat Movement (1974), and [[Tehreek Nizam-e-Mustafa|Nizam-e-Mustafa Movement]] (1977).<ref name=AMFO1994:518>[[#AMFO1994|Ahmed, \"Islamic Fundamentalism in South Asia\", 1994]]: p.518</ref> The Tablighi Jamaat, in response, states that it is only by avoiding the political debates that the Tablighi Jamaat has been successful in reawakening the spiritual conscience of the followers. The apolitical stance also helped them operate in difficult times, such as during the governments of [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] (1960s) and [[Indira Gandhi]] (1975\u201377), when other sociopolitical Islamic groups faced restrictions.<ref name=AMFO1994:518/>\n\nThe difference of opinion regarding political participation also marks the fundamental difference between the Tablighi Jamaat and Islamist movements. While the Islamists believe that the acquisition of political power is the absolute requirement for the establishment of an Islamic society, the Tablighi Jamaat believes that merely the political power is not enough to ensure effective organisation of the Islamic social order.<ref name=AMFO1994:519>[[#AMFO1994|Ahmed, \"Islamic Fundamentalism in South Asia\", 1994]]: p.519</ref> The exclusive focus of the Tablighi Jamaat's attention is the individual, and members believe the reformation of society and institutions will only be effective through education and reform of individuals. They insist that nations and social systems exist by the virtue of the individuals who form them; therefore, the reform must begin at the grass-roots with individuals and not at the higher level of political structure.<ref name=AMFO1994:517>[[#AMFO1994|Ahmed, \"Islamic Fundamentalism in South Asia\", 1994]]: p.517</ref>\n\nTJ have also been accused of insufficient orthodoxy and association with [[Sufism|Sufis]].<ref name=FAttatj>{{cite web |title=Fadhaa'il A'maal & the truth about Tableegh Jaam'aat.

Some scholars objected to the participation of women, but Muhammad Ilyas slowly gained their support and the first ''jamaat'' of women was formed in Nizamuddin, Delhi.<ref name=womenbm/> Accompanied by a close male relative, (\u0645\u062d\u0631\u0645), that is husband, brother, father or son, women are encouraged to go out in jamaats and work among other women and family members while following the rules of modesty, seclusion and segregation. They observe strict rules of hijab by covering their faces and hands.<ref name=daily/><ref name=womenbm/> ''Jamaats'' of women sometimes participate in large annual meetings; otherwise, they commonly hold neighbourhood meetings. Since South Asian Islamic culture discourages women from going to the mosque and saintly shrines, these venues offer an opportunity for women to pray together and congregate religiously.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\nIn many modern Islamist movements, women have been relegated to a domestic role. Tablighi Jamaat tends to blur the boundaries of gender roles and both genders share a common behavioural model and their commitment to tabligh. The emphasis is on a common nature and responsibilities shared by both genders. Just as men redraw the gender roles when they wash and cook during the course of ''da'wa'' tours, women undertake the male responsibility of sustaining the household.<ref name=womenbm/> Women do not play any role in the higher echelons of the movement,<ref name=daily/> but their opinions are taken into due considerations. Women and the family members are being to told to learn Quran and follow 5 Amaals in every day life, Taleem of Ahadees, Quran recitation,6 Points muzakera, and mashwara for daily life work and fikr for the whole world as people from around the world will be coming and they are the one who has to learn before they teach.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\n==Controversies==\n[[File:Cot Goh.jpg|thumb|Mushawara after Bayan Subh at Tablighi Jamaat center in Cot Goh, [[Montasik]], [[Aceh Besar]], [[Aceh]]]]\n\n===Criticism===\nDue to the orthodox nature of Tablighi Jamaat, they have been criticised for being retrogressive. The women in the movement observe complete [[hijab]] for which the Tablighi Jamaat is accused of keeping women \"strictly subservient and second string\".<ref name=daily/>\n\nTablighi Jamaat has also been criticised within Islamic circles and the major opposition in the Indian subcontinent comes from the [[Barelvi]] movement. One of the main criticisms against them is that the men neglect and ignore their families, especially by going out on ''da'wa'' tours. Tablighi Jamaat participants, in response, argue that both genders should be equally engaged in Tabligh. They further say that women, like men, are also urged to carry the responsibility of Tabligh and that men should facilitate women's participation by providing childcare.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\nMany critics, especially those from [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] and [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]], criticise Tabligh Jamaat for their neutral political stance. They say that Islamist forces, during their conflicts with secular or non-Islamist opponents, could have been helped by Tablighi Jamaat followers. Specifically they criticise the Tabligh Jamaat's neutral position towards issues in South Asia such as the introduction of an [[Constitution of Pakistan of 1956|Islamic constitution in Pakistan]] (1950s), Islam vs Socialism (1969\u20131971), communal riots in India in the 1970s and 1980s, the Khatm-e-Nabuwwat Movement (1974), and [[Tehreek Nizam-e-Mustafa|Nizam-e-Mustafa Movement]] (1977).<ref name=AMFO1994:518>[[#AMFO1994|Ahmed, \"Islamic Fundamentalism in South Asia\", 1994]]: p.518</ref> The Tablighi Jamaat, in response, states that it is only by avoiding the political debates that the Tablighi Jamaat has been successful in reawakening the spiritual conscience of the followers. The apolitical stance also helped them operate in difficult times, such as during the governments of [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] (1960s) and [[Indira Gandhi]] (1975\u201377), when other sociopolitical Islamic groups faced restrictions.<ref name=AMFO1994:518/>\n\nThe difference of opinion regarding political participation also marks the fundamental difference between the Tablighi Jamaat and Islamist movements. While the Islamists believe that the acquisition of political power is the absolute requirement for the establishment of an Islamic society, the Tablighi Jamaat believes that merely the political power is not enough to ensure effective organisation of the Islamic social order.<ref name=AMFO1994:519>[[#AMFO1994|Ahmed, \"Islamic Fundamentalism in South Asia\", 1994]]: p.519</ref> The exclusive focus of the Tablighi Jamaat's attention is the individual, and members believe the reformation of society and institutions will only be effective through education and reform of individuals. They insist that nations and social systems exist by the virtue of the individuals who form them; therefore, the reform must begin at the grass-roots with individuals and not at the higher level of political structure.<ref name=AMFO1994:517>[[#AMFO1994|Ahmed, \"Islamic Fundamentalism in South Asia\", 1994]]: p.517</ref>\n\nTJ have also been accused of insufficient orthodoxy and association with [[Sufism|Sufis]].<ref name=FAttatj>{{cite web |title=Fadhaa'il A'maal & the truth about Tableegh Jaam'aat.
