They play an important role in [[Chinese poetry]] and in comparative studies of tonal development in the modern [[varieties of Chinese]], both in traditional Chinese and in Western [[linguistics]]. They correspond to the [[historical Chinese phonology|phonology]] of [[Middle Chinese]], and are named ''even'' or ''level'' ({{lang|zh|\u5e73}} ''p\u00edng''), ''rising'' ({{lang|zh|\u4e0a}} ''sh\u01ceng''), ''departing'' (or ''going''; {{lang|zh|\u53bb}} ''q\u00f9''), and ''entering'' or ''[[checked tone|checked]]'' ({{lang|zh|\u5165}} ''r\u00f9'').<ref name=Baxter>{{cite book |title=A Handbook of Old Chinese Phonology |authors=Baxter, William H. |year=1992 |publisher=Mouton de Gruyter |location=Berlin, New York |isbn=3-11-012324-X |page=33}}</ref> (The last three are collectively referred to as ''oblique'' {{lang|zh|\u4ec4}} (''z\u00e8''), an important concept in poetic [[tone pattern]]s.) Due to historic splits and mergers, none of the modern varieties of Chinese have the exact four tones of Middle Chinese, but they are noted in rhyming dictionaries.\n\n==Background==\nAccording to the usual modern analysis, [[Early Middle Chinese]] had three [[phonemic]] tones in most syllables, but no tonal distinctions in checked syllables ending in the [[stop consonant]]s /p/, /t/, /k/.  In most circumstances, every syllable had its own tone; hence a multisyllabic word typically had a tone assigned to each syllable. (In modern varieties, the situation is sometimes more complicated. Although each syllable typically still has its own ''underlying'' tone in most dialects, some syllables in the speech of some varieties may have their tone modified into other tones or neutralized entirely, by a process known as [[tone sandhi]]. Furthermore, many [[varieties of Chinese]] deleted Middle Chinese final consonants, but these contrasts may have [[Transphonologization|been preserved]], helping lead to [[tonogenesis]] of contemporary multitonal systems.)\n\nTraditional Chinese [[Varieties of Chinese|dialectology]] reckons syllables ending in a stop consonant as possessing a fourth tone, known technically as a ''[[checked tone]]''.  This tone is known in traditional Chinese linguistics as the ''entering'' ({{lang|zh|\u5165}} ''r\u00f9'') tone, a term commonly used in English as well.  The other three tones were termed the ''level'' (or ''even'') tone ({{lang|zh|\u5e73}} ''p\u00edng''), the ''rising'' ({{lang|zh|\u4e0a}} ''sh\u01ceng'') tone, and the ''departing'' (or ''going'') tone ({{lang|zh|\u53bb}} ''q\u00f9'').<ref name=Baxter/>  The practice of setting up the entering tone as a separate class reflects the fact that the actual pitch contour of checked syllables was quite distinct from the pitch contour of any of the [[sonorant]]-final syllables.  Indeed, implicit in the organisation of the classical [[rime table]]s is a different, but structurally equally valid, phonemic analysis, which takes all four tones as phonemic and demotes the difference between stop finals {{IPA|[p t k]}} and nasal finals {{IPA|[m n \u014b]}} to [[allophonic]], with stops occurring in entering syllables and nasals elsewhere.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The non-uniqueness of phonemic solutions of phonetic systems |author=Chao, Yuen-Ren |year=1934 |journal=Bulletin of the Institute for History and Philology (Academia Sinica) |volume=4 |pages=363\u2013397}}</ref>\n\nFrom the perspective of modern [[historical linguistics]], there is often value in treating the \"entering tone\" as a tone regardless of its phonemic status, because syllables possessing this \"tone\" typically develop differently from syllables possessing any of the other three \"tones\".  For clarity, these four \"tones\" are often referred to as ''tone classes'', with each word belonging to one of the four tone classes.  This reflects the fact that the lexical division of words into tone classes is based on tone, but not all tone classes necessarily have a distinct phonemic tone associated with them.  Some contemporary [[Varieties of Chinese|f\u0101ngy\u00e1n]] such as [[Taiwanese Hokkien#Tones|Taiwanese Hokkien]], [[Jin Chinese#Phonology|Jin]] and [[Penang Hokkien#Tones|Penang]] are said to \"preserve the entering tone\", which is used as a marker to differentiate them from other varieties and also genetically classify them via the [[comparative method]].\n\nThe four Early Middle Chinese (EMC) tones are nearly always presented in the order  ''level'' ({{lang|zh|\u5e73}} ''p\u00edng''), ''rising'' ({{lang|zh|\u4e0a}} ''sh\u01ceng''), ''departing'' ({{lang|zh|\u53bb}} ''q\u00f9''), ''entering'' ({{lang|zh|\u5165}} ''r\u00f9''), and correspondingly numbered 1 2 3 4 in modern discussions.  In [[Late Middle Chinese]] (LMC), each of the EMC tone classes split in two, depending on the nature of the initial consonant of the syllable in question.  Discussions of LMC and the various modern varieties will often number these split tone classes from 1 through 8, keeping the same ordering as before.  For example, LMC/modern tone classes 1 and 2 derive from EMC tone class 1; LMC/modern tone classes 3 and 4 derive from EMC tone class 2; etc.  The odd-numbered tone classes 1 3 5 7 are termed ''dark'' ({{lang|zh|\u9670}} ''y\u012bn''), whereas the even-numbered tone classes 2 4 6 8 are termed ''light'' ({{lang|zh|\u967d}} ''y\u00e1ng''). Hence, for example, LMC/modern tone class 5 is known in Chinese as the ''y\u012bn q\u00f9'' (\"dark departing\") tone, indicating that it is the ''y\u012bn'' variant of the EMC ''q\u00f9'' tone (EMC tone 3).  In order to clarify the relationship between the EMC and LMC tone classes, some authors notate the LMC tone classes as 1a 1b 2a 2b 3a 3b 4a 4b in place of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8, where ''a'' and ''b'' correspond directly to Chinese ''y\u012bn'' and ''y\u00e1ng'', respectively.\n\n==Names==\nIn Middle Chinese, each of the [[tone name]]s carries the tone it identifies: {{lang|zh|\u5e73}} level \ua701''{{IPA|biaj\u014b}}'', {{lang|zh|\u4e0a}} rising \ua703''{{IPA|d\u0291\u0268a\u014b}}'', {{lang|zh|\u53bb}} departing ''{{IPA|k\u02b0\u0268\u0259}}''\ua704, and {{lang|zh|\u5165}} entering ''{{IPA|\u0235ip}}''\ua707.<ref>[[Edwin G. Pulleyblank|Pulleyblank]]'s reconstructions</ref> However, in some modern Chinese varieties, this is no longer true. This loss of correspondence is most notable in the case of the entering tone, syllables checked in a stop consonant {{IPA|[p\u031a]}}, {{IPA|[t\u031a]}}, or {{IPA|[k\u031a]}} in Middle Chinese, which has been lost from most dialects of [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] and redistributed among the other tones. \n\nIn modern Chinese varieties, tones that derive from the four Middle Chinese tone classes may be split into two registers, ''dark'' ({{lang|zh|\u9670}} ''y\u012bn'') and ''light'' ({{lang|zh|\u967d}} ''y\u00e1ng'') depending on whether the Middle Chinese [[syllable onset|onset]] was voiceless or voiced, respectively. When all four tone-classes split, eight tones result: ''dark level'' ({{lang|zh|\u9670\u5e73}}), ''light level'' ({{lang|zh|\u967d\u5e73}}), ''dark rising'' ({{lang|zh|\u9670\u4e0a}}), ''light rising'' ({{lang|zh|\u967d\u4e0a}}), ''dark departing'' ({{lang|zh|\u9670\u53bb}}), ''light departing'' ({{lang|zh|\u967d\u53bb}}), ''dark entering'' ({{lang|zh|\u9670\u5165}}), and ''light entering'' ({{lang|zh|\u967d\u5165}}). Sometimes these have been termed ''upper'' and ''lower'' registers respectively, but that may be a misnomer, as in some dialects the dark registers may have the lower tone, and the light register the higher tone. \n\nChinese dictionaries mark the tones with diacritical marks at the four corners of a character:<ref>{{cite book\n| last    = Karlgren\n| first   = Bernhard\n| last2   =\n| first2  =\n| author-link  = Bernhard Karlgren\n| year     = 1974\n| origyear = 1923\n| title    = Analytic Dictionary of Chinese and Sino-Japanese\n| chapter  = Introduction I.

When ''yin'' and ''yang'' tones are distinguished, these are the diacritics for the ''yin'' (dark) tones; the ''yang'' (light) tones are indicated by underscoring the diacritic: {{lang|zh|\ua701\u5e73}} light level, {{lang|zh|\ua703\u4e0a}} light rising, {{lang|zh|\u53bb\ua705}} light departing, {{lang|zh|\u5165\ua707}} light entering. These diacritics are also sometimes used when the phonetic tone is unknown, as in the reconstructions of Middle Chinese at the beginning of this section. However, in this article, the circled numbers \u2460\u2461\u2462\u2463\u2464\u2465\u2466\u2467 will be used, as in the table below, with the odd numbers \u2460\u2462\u2464\u2466 indicating either 'dark' tones or tones that have not split, and even numbers \u2461\u2463\u2465\u2467 indicating 'light' tones. Thus, level tones are numbered \u2460\u2461, the rising tones \u2462\u2463, the departing tones \u2464\u2465, and the entering (checked) tones \u2466\u2467. \n\nIn [[Yue Chinese|Yue]] (incl. [[Cantonese]]) the dark entering tone further splits into ''high'' ({{lang|zh|\u9ad8\u9670\u5165}}) and ''low'' ({{lang|zh|\u4f4e\u9670\u5165}}) registers, depending on the length of the [[syllable nucleus|nucleus]], for a total of nine tone-classes. Some dialects have a complex tone splittings, and the terms ''dark'' and ''light'' are insufficient to cover the possibilities. \n\nThe number of tone-classes is based on Chinese tradition, and is as much [[register (phonology)|register]] as it is actual tone. The entering 'tones', for example, are distinct only because they are checked by a final stop consonant, not because they have a tone contour that contrasts with non-entering tones. In dialects such as [[Shanghainese]], tone classes are numbered even if they are not phonemically distinct.\n\n==Origin==\n{{see also|Tonogenesis}}\nThe tonal aspect of Chinese dialects that is so important today is believed by some linguists to have been absent from [[Old Chinese]], but rather came about in Early [[Middle Chinese]] after the loss of various [[Syllable#Medial_and_final|finals]].<ref name=\"Sagart\">{{cite web|last1=Sagart|first1=Laurent|title=The origin of Chinese tones|work=Proceedings of the Symposium/Cross-Linguistic Studies of Tonal Phenomena/Tonogenesis, Typology and Related Topics|url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/file/index/docid/96904/filename/TOKYO_tone_published.pdf|publisher=Institute for the Study of Languages and Cultures of Asia and Africa, Tokyo University of Foreign Studies|accessdate=1 December 2014}}</ref> (However, another popular view maintains that \"[[Old Chinese]]\" near the time 1000BC already had tones, though Proto-Chinese might not have tones.) The four tones of Middle Chinese, {{lang|zh|\u5e73}} ''p\u00edng'' \"level\", {{lang|zh|\u4e0a}} ''sh\u01ceng'' \"rising\", {{lang|zh|\u53bb}} ''q\u00f9'' \"departing\", and {{lang|zh|\u5165}} ''r\u00f9'' \"entering\", all evolved from different final losses from Old Chinese. The {{lang|zh|\u4e0a}}, or \"rising\" tone, arose from the loss of [[glottal stops]] at the end of words. Support for this can be seen in Buddhist transcriptions of the Han period, where the \"rising\" tone was often used to note Sanskrit short vowels, and also in loans of words with final {{IPA|[q]}} in the source language, which were borrowed into Chinese as ''shang'' tone. The glottal stop even survives in some Min and Hakka dialects, either as a phonetic glottal stop, a short creaky vowel, or [[denasalization]], which for example the final -ng of Old Chinese has changed to modern {{IPA|[\u0261]}} in ''shang''-tone words.<ref>Branner, David (1999). ''Problems in Comparative Chinese Dialectology: The Classification of Miin and Hakka.''\u2002De Gruyter Mouton</ref> This evolution of final glottal stop into a rising tone is similar to what happened in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], another tonal language.<ref>{{cite journal|first1=Tsu-Lin|last1=Mei|title=Tones and Prosody in Middle Chinese and The Origin of The Rising Tone|jstor=2718766|publisher=Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies|volume=30|year=1970|pages=86\u2013110}}</ref> The {{lang|zh|\u53bb}}, or \"departing\" tone, arose from the loss of [-s] at the end of words. Support for this theory is found when examining Chinese loans into neighbouring East Asian languages. For example, in Korean, the word for \"comb\", ''pis'', is a loan of the Chinese word ''b\u00ec'' {{lang|zh|\u7be6}}, which means that when the word \"comb\" was borrowed into Korean, there was still an [-s] sound at the end of the word that later disappeared from Chinese and gave rise to a departing {{lang|zh|\u53bb}} tone. The {{lang|zh|\u5165}}, or \"entering\" tone consisted of words ending in voiceless stops, [-p], [-t], and [-k]. Finally, the {{lang|zh|\u5e73}}, or \"level\" tone, arose from the lack of sound at the ends of words, where there was neither [-s], a glottal stop, nor [-p], [-t], or [-k].<ref name=\"Sagart\"/>\n\n==Distribution in modern Chinese==\nSample dialects and their realization of tone are given below. \n\nDifferent authors typically have different opinions as to the shapes of Chinese tones. Tones typically have a slight purely-phonetic drop at the end in citation form. It is therefore likely that a tone with a drop of one unit (54, say, or 21) is not distinct from a level tone (a 55 or 22); on the other hand, what one author hears as a significant drop (53 or 31) may be perceived by another as a smaller drop so it is often ambiguous whether a transcription like 54 or 21 is a level or contour tone. Similarly, a slight drop before a rise, such as a 214, may be from the speaker approaching the target tone and so may also not be distinctive (from 14).<ref>Matthew Chen, 2000.

They play an important role in [[Chinese poetry]] and in comparative studies of tonal development in the modern [[varieties of Chinese]], both in traditional Chinese and in Western [[linguistics]]. They correspond to the [[historical Chinese phonology|phonology]] of [[Middle Chinese]], and are named ''even'' or ''level'' ({{lang|zh|\u5e73}} ''p\u00edng''), ''rising'' ({{lang|zh|\u4e0a}} ''sh\u01ceng''), ''departing'' (or ''going''; {{lang|zh|\u53bb}} ''q\u00f9''), and ''entering'' or ''[[checked tone|checked]]'' ({{lang|zh|\u5165}} ''r\u00f9'').<ref name=Baxter>{{cite book |title=A Handbook of Old Chinese Phonology |authors=Baxter, William H. |year=1992 |publisher=Mouton de Gruyter |location=Berlin, New York |isbn=3-11-012324-X |page=33}}</ref> (The last three are collectively referred to as ''oblique'' {{lang|zh|\u4ec4}} (''z\u00e8''), an important concept in poetic [[tone pattern]]s.) Due to historic splits and mergers, none of the modern varieties of Chinese have the exact four tones of Middle Chinese, but they are noted in rhyming dictionaries.\n\n==Background==\nAccording to the usual modern analysis, [[Early Middle Chinese]] had three [[phonemic]] tones in most syllables, but no tonal distinctions in checked syllables ending in the [[stop consonant]]s /p/, /t/, /k/.  In most circumstances, every syllable had its own tone; hence a multisyllabic word typically had a tone assigned to each syllable. (In modern varieties, the situation is sometimes more complicated. Although each syllable typically still has its own ''underlying'' tone in most dialects, some syllables in the speech of some varieties may have their tone modified into other tones or neutralized entirely, by a process known as [[tone sandhi]]. Furthermore, many [[varieties of Chinese]] deleted Middle Chinese final consonants, but these contrasts may have [[Transphonologization|been preserved]], helping lead to [[tonogenesis]] of contemporary multitonal systems.)\n\nTraditional Chinese [[Varieties of Chinese|dialectology]] reckons syllables ending in a stop consonant as possessing a fourth tone, known technically as a ''[[checked tone]]''.  This tone is known in traditional Chinese linguistics as the ''entering'' ({{lang|zh|\u5165}} ''r\u00f9'') tone, a term commonly used in English as well.  The other three tones were termed the ''level'' (or ''even'') tone ({{lang|zh|\u5e73}} ''p\u00edng''), the ''rising'' ({{lang|zh|\u4e0a}} ''sh\u01ceng'') tone, and the ''departing'' (or ''going'') tone ({{lang|zh|\u53bb}} ''q\u00f9'').<ref name=Baxter/>  The practice of setting up the entering tone as a separate class reflects the fact that the actual pitch contour of checked syllables was quite distinct from the pitch contour of any of the [[sonorant]]-final syllables.  Indeed, implicit in the organisation of the classical [[rime table]]s is a different, but structurally equally valid, phonemic analysis, which takes all four tones as phonemic and demotes the difference between stop finals {{IPA|[p t k]}} and nasal finals {{IPA|[m n \u014b]}} to [[allophonic]], with stops occurring in entering syllables and nasals elsewhere.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The non-uniqueness of phonemic solutions of phonetic systems |author=Chao, Yuen-Ren |year=1934 |journal=Bulletin of the Institute for History and Philology (Academia Sinica) |volume=4 |pages=363\u2013397}}</ref>\n\nFrom the perspective of modern [[historical linguistics]], there is often value in treating the \"entering tone\" as a tone regardless of its phonemic status, because syllables possessing this \"tone\" typically develop differently from syllables possessing any of the other three \"tones\".  For clarity, these four \"tones\" are often referred to as ''tone classes'', with each word belonging to one of the four tone classes.  This reflects the fact that the lexical division of words into tone classes is based on tone, but not all tone classes necessarily have a distinct phonemic tone associated with them.  Some contemporary [[Varieties of Chinese|f\u0101ngy\u00e1n]] such as [[Taiwanese Hokkien#Tones|Taiwanese Hokkien]], [[Jin Chinese#Phonology|Jin]] and [[Penang Hokkien#Tones|Penang]] are said to \"preserve the entering tone\", which is used as a marker to differentiate them from other varieties and also genetically classify them via the [[comparative method]].\n\nThe four Early Middle Chinese (EMC) tones are nearly always presented in the order  ''level'' ({{lang|zh|\u5e73}} ''p\u00edng''), ''rising'' ({{lang|zh|\u4e0a}} ''sh\u01ceng''), ''departing'' ({{lang|zh|\u53bb}} ''q\u00f9''), ''entering'' ({{lang|zh|\u5165}} ''r\u00f9''), and correspondingly numbered 1 2 3 4 in modern discussions.  In [[Late Middle Chinese]] (LMC), each of the EMC tone classes split in two, depending on the nature of the initial consonant of the syllable in question.  Discussions of LMC and the various modern varieties will often number these split tone classes from 1 through 8, keeping the same ordering as before.  For example, LMC/modern tone classes 1 and 2 derive from EMC tone class 1; LMC/modern tone classes 3 and 4 derive from EMC tone class 2; etc.  The odd-numbered tone classes 1 3 5 7 are termed ''dark'' ({{lang|zh|\u9670}} ''y\u012bn''), whereas the even-numbered tone classes 2 4 6 8 are termed ''light'' ({{lang|zh|\u967d}} ''y\u00e1ng''). Hence, for example, LMC/modern tone class 5 is known in Chinese as the ''y\u012bn q\u00f9'' (\"dark departing\") tone, indicating that it is the ''y\u012bn'' variant of the EMC ''q\u00f9'' tone (EMC tone 3).  In order to clarify the relationship between the EMC and LMC tone classes, some authors notate the LMC tone classes as 1a 1b 2a 2b 3a 3b 4a 4b in place of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8, where ''a'' and ''b'' correspond directly to Chinese ''y\u012bn'' and ''y\u00e1ng'', respectively.\n\n==Names==\nIn Middle Chinese, each of the [[tone name]]s carries the tone it identifies: {{lang|zh|\u5e73}} level \ua701''{{IPA|biaj\u014b}}'', {{lang|zh|\u4e0a}} rising \ua703''{{IPA|d\u0291\u0268a\u014b}}'', {{lang|zh|\u53bb}} departing ''{{IPA|k\u02b0\u0268\u0259}}''\ua704, and {{lang|zh|\u5165}} entering ''{{IPA|\u0235ip}}''\ua707.<ref>[[Edwin G. Pulleyblank|Pulleyblank]]'s reconstructions</ref> However, in some modern Chinese varieties, this is no longer true. This loss of correspondence is most notable in the case of the entering tone, syllables checked in a stop consonant {{IPA|[p\u031a]}}, {{IPA|[t\u031a]}}, or {{IPA|[k\u031a]}} in Middle Chinese, which has been lost from most dialects of [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] and redistributed among the other tones. \n\nIn modern Chinese varieties, tones that derive from the four Middle Chinese tone classes may be split into two registers, ''dark'' ({{lang|zh|\u9670}} ''y\u012bn'') and ''light'' ({{lang|zh|\u967d}} ''y\u00e1ng'') depending on whether the Middle Chinese [[syllable onset|onset]] was voiceless or voiced, respectively. When all four tone-classes split, eight tones result: ''dark level'' ({{lang|zh|\u9670\u5e73}}), ''light level'' ({{lang|zh|\u967d\u5e73}}), ''dark rising'' ({{lang|zh|\u9670\u4e0a}}), ''light rising'' ({{lang|zh|\u967d\u4e0a}}), ''dark departing'' ({{lang|zh|\u9670\u53bb}}), ''light departing'' ({{lang|zh|\u967d\u53bb}}), ''dark entering'' ({{lang|zh|\u9670\u5165}}), and ''light entering'' ({{lang|zh|\u967d\u5165}}). Sometimes these have been termed ''upper'' and ''lower'' registers respectively, but that may be a misnomer, as in some dialects the dark registers may have the lower tone, and the light register the higher tone. \n\nChinese dictionaries mark the tones with diacritical marks at the four corners of a character:<ref>{{cite book\n| last    = Karlgren\n| first   = Bernhard\n| last2   =\n| first2  =\n| author-link  = Bernhard Karlgren\n| year     = 1974\n| origyear = 1923\n| title    = Analytic Dictionary of Chinese and Sino-Japanese\n| chapter  = Introduction I.

When ''yin'' and ''yang'' tones are distinguished, these are the diacritics for the ''yin'' (dark) tones; the ''yang'' (light) tones are indicated by underscoring the diacritic: {{lang|zh|\ua701\u5e73}} light level, {{lang|zh|\ua703\u4e0a}} light rising, {{lang|zh|\u53bb\ua705}} light departing, {{lang|zh|\u5165\ua707}} light entering. These diacritics are also sometimes used when the phonetic tone is unknown, as in the reconstructions of Middle Chinese at the beginning of this section. However, in this article, the circled numbers \u2460\u2461\u2462\u2463\u2464\u2465\u2466\u2467 will be used, as in the table below, with the odd numbers \u2460\u2462\u2464\u2466 indicating either 'dark' tones or tones that have not split, and even numbers \u2461\u2463\u2465\u2467 indicating 'light' tones. Thus, level tones are numbered \u2460\u2461, the rising tones \u2462\u2463, the departing tones \u2464\u2465, and the entering (checked) tones \u2466\u2467. \n\nIn [[Yue Chinese|Yue]] (incl. [[Cantonese]]) the dark entering tone further splits into ''high'' ({{lang|zh|\u9ad8\u9670\u5165}}) and ''low'' ({{lang|zh|\u4f4e\u9670\u5165}}) registers, depending on the length of the [[syllable nucleus|nucleus]], for a total of nine tone-classes. Some dialects have a complex tone splittings, and the terms ''dark'' and ''light'' are insufficient to cover the possibilities. \n\nThe number of tone-classes is based on Chinese tradition, and is as much [[register (phonology)|register]] as it is actual tone. The entering 'tones', for example, are distinct only because they are checked by a final stop consonant, not because they have a tone contour that contrasts with non-entering tones. In dialects such as [[Shanghainese]], tone classes are numbered even if they are not phonemically distinct.\n\n==Origin==\n{{see also|Tonogenesis}}\nThe tonal aspect of Chinese dialects that is so important today is believed by some linguists to have been absent from [[Old Chinese]], but rather came about in Early [[Middle Chinese]] after the loss of various [[Syllable#Medial_and_final|finals]].<ref name=\"Sagart\">{{cite web|last1=Sagart|first1=Laurent|title=The origin of Chinese tones|work=Proceedings of the Symposium/Cross-Linguistic Studies of Tonal Phenomena/Tonogenesis, Typology and Related Topics|url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/file/index/docid/96904/filename/TOKYO_tone_published.pdf|publisher=Institute for the Study of Languages and Cultures of Asia and Africa, Tokyo University of Foreign Studies|accessdate=1 December 2014}}</ref> (However, another popular view maintains that \"[[Old Chinese]]\" near the time 1000BC already had tones, though Proto-Chinese might not have tones.) The four tones of Middle Chinese, {{lang|zh|\u5e73}} ''p\u00edng'' \"level\", {{lang|zh|\u4e0a}} ''sh\u01ceng'' \"rising\", {{lang|zh|\u53bb}} ''q\u00f9'' \"departing\", and {{lang|zh|\u5165}} ''r\u00f9'' \"entering\", all evolved from different final losses from Old Chinese. The {{lang|zh|\u4e0a}}, or \"rising\" tone, arose from the loss of [[glottal stops]] at the end of words. Support for this can be seen in Buddhist transcriptions of the Han period, where the \"rising\" tone was often used to note Sanskrit short vowels, and also in loans of words with final {{IPA|[q]}} in the source language, which were borrowed into Chinese as ''shang'' tone. The glottal stop even survives in some Min and Hakka dialects, either as a phonetic glottal stop, a short creaky vowel, or [[denasalization]], which for example the final -ng of Old Chinese has changed to modern {{IPA|[\u0261]}} in ''shang''-tone words.<ref>Branner, David (1999). ''Problems in Comparative Chinese Dialectology: The Classification of Miin and Hakka.''\u2002De Gruyter Mouton</ref> This evolution of final glottal stop into a rising tone is similar to what happened in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], another tonal language.<ref>{{cite journal|first1=Tsu-Lin|last1=Mei|title=Tones and Prosody in Middle Chinese and The Origin of The Rising Tone|jstor=2718766|publisher=Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies|volume=30|year=1970|pages=86\u2013110}}</ref> The {{lang|zh|\u53bb}}, or \"departing\" tone, arose from the loss of [-s] at the end of words. Support for this theory is found when examining Chinese loans into neighbouring East Asian languages. For example, in Korean, the word for \"comb\", ''pis'', is a loan of the Chinese word ''b\u00ec'' {{lang|zh|\u7be6}}, which means that when the word \"comb\" was borrowed into Korean, there was still an [-s] sound at the end of the word that later disappeared from Chinese and gave rise to a departing {{lang|zh|\u53bb}} tone. The {{lang|zh|\u5165}}, or \"entering\" tone consisted of words ending in voiceless stops, [-p], [-t], and [-k]. Finally, the {{lang|zh|\u5e73}}, or \"level\" tone, arose from the lack of sound at the ends of words, where there was neither [-s], a glottal stop, nor [-p], [-t], or [-k].<ref name=\"Sagart\"/>\n\n==Distribution in modern Chinese==\nSample dialects and their realization of tone are given below. \n\nDifferent authors typically have different opinions as to the shapes of Chinese tones. Tones typically have a slight purely-phonetic drop at the end in citation form. It is therefore likely that a tone with a drop of one unit (54, say, or 21) is not distinct from a level tone (a 55 or 22); on the other hand, what one author hears as a significant drop (53 or 31) may be perceived by another as a smaller drop so it is often ambiguous whether a transcription like 54 or 21 is a level or contour tone. Similarly, a slight drop before a rise, such as a 214, may be from the speaker approaching the target tone and so may also not be distinctive (from 14).<ref>Matthew Chen, 2000.

He was an avid fan of [[superheroes]], and his mother would buy him stacks of comics from flea markets. He learned to draw from all those old comics.\n\nMcDaniel graduated from the Penn Hills Senior High School in Penn Hills, Pennsylvania. After graduation Scott wanted to be a surgeon, and attended Bucknell University in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, where his father's heart surgeon studied.\nHe was enrolled as a Pre-Med student until the day he walked into Inorganic Chemistry and saw a 4-foot-long Schr\u00f6dinger Wave equation scrawled on the chalk board. At that moment he knew Pre-Med was not for him.\n\nNext he became a chemistry major, and then a chemical engineering major. In freshman year at Bucknell he met [[Glenn Herdling]], a friendship that would last for quite some time.\n\nAfter graduating from Bucknell, Glenn took his double major (English and Psychology) and went on to work with [[Marvel Comics]]. Scott took his BS in electrical engineering and went to work with the Kearfott Division of the Singer Company.\n[[File:Nightwing100.jpg|thumb|160px|Cover to ''Nightwing'' #100 (2004). Art by Scott McDaniel.]]\nHe married his high school girlfriend and had a son Alex.\n\nHe worked as an electrical engineer during the day, and worked on his art in the evenings. His friend Glenn would take his art into [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] to get critiques by other editors and artists.\n\nAfter several years of that critiquing, McDaniel began to get small penciling jobs from Marvel.\n\nMcDaniel relocated to Pittsburgh (in the suburb Monroeville), and continued working as an electrical engineer with the Loftus Division of the [[Eichleay Engineers|Eichleay Corporation]].\nAbout a year later, McDaniel was getting more assignments from [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]].\nWhen the call came with an opportunity to work on Daredevil, he quit his engineering job and began his career as a comic book artist.\n\n===Art style===\nMcDaniel's work tends to feature bold, bright colors against stark black, with a greater than average attention to fight scenes.\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Expand section|date=May 2010}}\nInterior comics work includes:\n*''Daredevil'' #305-315, #317-327, #328 (Cover), #329-332, Annual #9-10\n*''[[Nightwing (comic book)|Nightwing]]'' (1996\u20132005):\n**Issues 1-40, 92, 95, 101-106, Wizard 1/2, 1,000,000, Secret Files & Origins #1, The Target\n*''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' #575-586, 588-607,(2000\u20132002)\n*''[[Detective Comics]]'' #691-692, 766, 887-870 (1995, 2002, 2010)\n*''[[Richard Dragon]]'' #1-12 (2004-2005)\n*''[[Robin (comic book)|Robin]]'' #139-147 (2005\u20132006)\n*''[[Green Arrow (comic book)|Green Arrow]]'' #60-75 (2006\u20132007)\n*''[[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]] Annual'' #1\n*''[[Static (DC Comics)|Static Shock]]'' #1-8 (2011)\n* ''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #225, Annual #9, 12 (1989, 1992)\n* ''Marvel Comics Presents'' #71, 74 (1991)\n* ''What If...?''

After graduation Scott wanted to be a surgeon, and attended Bucknell University in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, where his father's heart surgeon studied.\nHe was enrolled as a Pre-Med student until the day he walked into Inorganic Chemistry and saw a 4-foot-long Schr\u00f6dinger Wave equation scrawled on the chalk board. At that moment he knew Pre-Med was not for him.\n\nNext he became a chemistry major, and then a chemical engineering major. In freshman year at Bucknell he met [[Glenn Herdling]], a friendship that would last for quite some time.\n\nAfter graduating from Bucknell, Glenn took his double major (English and Psychology) and went on to work with [[Marvel Comics]]. Scott took his BS in electrical engineering and went to work with the Kearfott Division of the Singer Company.\n[[File:Nightwing100.jpg|thumb|160px|Cover to ''Nightwing'' #100 (2004). Art by Scott McDaniel.]]\nHe married his high school girlfriend and had a son Alex.\n\nHe worked as an electrical engineer during the day, and worked on his art in the evenings. His friend Glenn would take his art into [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] to get critiques by other editors and artists.\n\nAfter several years of that critiquing, McDaniel began to get small penciling jobs from Marvel.\n\nMcDaniel relocated to Pittsburgh (in the suburb Monroeville), and continued working as an electrical engineer with the Loftus Division of the [[Eichleay Engineers|Eichleay Corporation]].\nAbout a year later, McDaniel was getting more assignments from [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]].\nWhen the call came with an opportunity to work on Daredevil, he quit his engineering job and began his career as a comic book artist.\n\n===Art style===\nMcDaniel's work tends to feature bold, bright colors against stark black, with a greater than average attention to fight scenes.\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Expand section|date=May 2010}}\nInterior comics work includes:\n*''Daredevil #305-315, #317-327, #328 (Cover), #329-332, Annual #9-10\n*''[[Nightwing (comic book)|Nightwing]]'' (1996\u20132005):\n**Issues 1-40, 92, 95, 101-106, Wizard 1/2, 1,000,000, Secret Files & Origins #1, The Target\n*''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' #575-586, 588-607,(2000\u20132002)\n*''[[Detective Comics]]'' #691-692, 766, 887-870 (1995, 2002, 2010)\n*''[[Richard Dragon]]'' #1-12 (2004-2005)\n*''[[Robin (comic book)|Robin]]'' #139-147 (2005\u20132006)\n*''[[Green Arrow (comic book)|Green Arrow]]'' #60-75 (2006\u20132007)\n*''[[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]] Annual'' #1\n*''[[Static (DC Comics)|Static Shock]]'' #1-8 (2011)\n* ''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #225, Annual #9, 12 (1989, 1992)\n* ''Marvel Comics Presents'' #71, 74 (1991)\n* ''What If...?''
