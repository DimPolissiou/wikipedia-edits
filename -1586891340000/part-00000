Many elements of technology, such as [[electricity]] and ground vehicles, have survived the apocalypse but society now shuns guns, leading to a reliance on [[melee weapon]]ry and [[crossbow]]s.\n\nIn a territory known as the Badlands, encompassing several states located between the Rocky Mountains and Mississippi River,<ref>Map shown in S03E03</ref> a feudal society has developed to fill the power vacuum left by the war. Barons control land and monopolies over commodities like [[opium]] and fuel, trading amongst themselves to maintain the peace. Each baron is served by a massive workforce of slaves called cogs, as well as a prostitute class called dolls. A baron maintains power through a corps of young men and women called clippers: highly trained and loyal warriors, clippers are forbidden from marrying and having children lest their loyalties be divided. Each clipper force is captained by a regent.\n\nSeveral groups exist outside the strict hierarchy of the barons. Nomads are the most common, mostly lawless homicidal bandits who subsist on stealing from trade convoys between the baronies but some live in organized clans. The River King and his men control water trade in the Badlands and beyond, and is considered a neutral party in the barons' power struggles. An ascetic religious movement called the Totemists is also shown to exist on the fringes of society, living in isolated communities and practicing a form of [[idol worship]]. The Widow leads a revolutionary group of anti-feudal fighters from her late husband's barony; although nominally recognized as a baron by her peers, they do not respect her, and the contempt is mutual.\n\nLittle is known of the world beyond the Badlands, but it is implied that it is far less politically stable and environmentally sound than the Badlands. The mythical utopian city of Azra is believed to exist outside the Badlands but most dismiss it as a legend.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n===Main===\n* [[Daniel Wu]] as Sunny, regent (head clipper) to the Badlands' most powerful baron, Quinn.

This efficient AMC series is an homage to classic [[Samurai films]] and kinetic action fare churned out by Hong Kong maestros of furious fists, and if the TV drama had failed to meet the standards set by the sturdiest examples of those genres, it would have seemed superfluous at best. Fortunately, star [[Daniel Wu]] is more than up to the task of occupying the center of this streamlined story of vengeance, tyranny and roundhouse kicks.<ref>{{cite

civilization in ruins. Many elements of technology, such as [[electricity]] and ground vehicles, have survived the apocalypse but society now shuns guns, leading to a reliance on [[melee weapon]]ry and [[crossbow]]s.\n\nIn a territory known as the Badlands, encompassing several states located between the Rocky Mountains and Mississippi River,<ref>Map shown in S03E03</ref> a feudal society has developed to fill the power vacuum left by the war. Barons control land and monopolies over commodities like [[opium]] and fuel, trading amongst themselves to maintain the peace. Each baron is served by a massive workforce of slaves called cogs, as well as a prostitute class called dolls. A baron maintains power through a corps of young men and women called clippers: highly trained and loyal warriors, clippers are forbidden from marrying and having children lest their loyalties be divided. Each clipper force is captained by a regent.\n\nSeveral groups exist outside the strict hierarchy of the barons. Nomads are the most common, mostly lawless homicidal bandits who subsist on stealing from trade convoys between the baronies but some live in organized clans. The River King and his men control water trade in the Badlands and beyond, and is considered a neutral party in the barons' power struggles. An ascetic religious movement called the Totemists is also shown to exist on the fringes of society, living in isolated communities and practicing a form of [[idol worship]]. The Widow leads a revolutionary group of anti-feudal fighters from her late husband's barony; although nominally recognized as a baron by her peers, they do not respect her, and the contempt is mutual.\n\nLittle is known of the world beyond the Badlands, but it is implied that it is far less politically stable and environmentally sound than the Badlands. The mythical utopian city of Azra is believed to exist outside the Badlands but most dismiss it as a legend.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n===Main===\n* [[Daniel Wu]] as Sunny, regent (head clipper) to the Badlands' most powerful baron, Quinn.

This novel also has many metaphors and ties to the [[Holocaust]]. This book is very loyal to Robert Cormier's style as it is very short and haunting. It is also in his vein of younger boys discovering darker sides of life and it is left unclear whether the protagonist did the right thing or not.\nThe title originates from a line in Gustave Flaubert's Madame Bovary: \"Language is a cracked kettle on which we beat out tunes for bears to dance to, while all the time we long to move the stars to pity.\"\n\n==Plot summary==\nHenry's family moves to a new town to run away from the memories of their recently passed son, Eddie, who was hit by a car in which the driver instantly drove away, never to be seen.  Henry's father is traumatized by Eddie's death and becomes very quiet and no longer works, while Henry's mother works long hours as a waitress in order to support their family. Another problem Henry faces is that there is no stone to mark Eddie's grave. Henry also contributes to his family by working at a [[grocery store]] for a man named Mr. Hairston, a deceptive old man who makes rude comments about the townsfolk that would walk by his store,\n\nMr. Hairston is a perfectionist, which is why he insults many people, including his wife and beats his daughter, Doris, when she messes something up. He appears to have a special liking to Henry, occasionally giving him candy bars.\n\nEvery day, Henry watches a curious old man leave the crazy house near his apartment and disappear down the street. Henry is very curious about what the old man does but cannot follow him because he was on crutches, and still does not know how to use them.  The day after his leg is healed, Henry follows the crazy man one day to an [[art center]], where he meets him in person and learns his name is Mr. Levine and he is a [[Holocaust]] survivor who lost his family to the SS. He goes to the art center every day to carve out a model of his old hometown town to bring back all the people he had lost, including his wife and kids. Henry and Mr. Levine become very close despite not speaking the same language.\n\nHenry finds out that Mr. Levine is in the \"crazy house\" because the Holocaust had affected him mentally. He still tips his hat randomly, something the Nazis had made him do, as a joke, while was imprisoned. Mr. Levine also frightened very easily, even by Henry, thinking that he was going to beat him, even though he is only 11 because the Nazi guards had beaten him so often.\n\nOne day, Henry tells Mr. Hairston about Mr. Levine's village, who becomes strangely interested. Later, Henry asks Mr. Hairston if he can somehow find him a good gravestone to put over Eddie's grave, which he surprisingly agrees to buy for him, and shows him a sketch of the gravestone, of a bat and baseball, because of Eddie's love for the game. Later on, Henry peeks at the drawing of the grave to find that Mr. Hairston had drawn a large black X on it. Mr. Hairston one day tells Henry that he will be fired at the end of the week for no reason and that he no longer receives the gravestone from him. Henry returns home and finds that his father is being sent to the hospital, to be treated for depression.\n\nUnable to deal with the stress of losing the gravestone, his job, and father in the same day, Henry goes to the art center. He finds that Mr. Levine's village had been given first prize from the city for being the best work of art and was going to be put on display at the town hall.  Mr Levine invites Henry to the ceremony, practicing his English so he could ask Henry in person, instead of it being translated, like in every other conversation they had, and Henry accepts. Further, into the week, Mr. Hairston tells Henry that he will let him keep the job and the headstone at one condition he must destroy Mr. Levine's model village. He also says he had close relationships with Henry's principal and his mother's boss and threatens to have his mother fired and his school reputation collapse if he was not to do what Mr. Hairston wants. The reward, if Henry destroys the replica village, would be a raise of his mom's pay and get her a promotion, him keeping his job, and giving him the headstone. Henry tells no one of his situation, even his mother, to avoid stressing her out more and has to decide what to do on his own. Not knowing what he should do, he hides in the storage room at the art center and finds a mallet just in case he wants to destroy the village, as he is still unable to make up his mind. Henry falls asleep in the storage room and when he wakes up, he finds the art center deserted.  Henry then finds the mallet and brings it above his head ready to smash the village when he decides not to do it.\n\nJust then a rat startles him and he drops the tool on the village, destroying part of it. On his way home, Mr. Hairston waits for him at a closed furniture store in the rain and explains why he wanted the village destroyed: \"Because he is a Jew\" and to give the old man something to do. Henry then says that he does not want the rewards Mr. Hairston offers.  Mr. Hairston insists for Henry to take the rewards saying that they were as important to the deal as Henry smashing the village. This shows that Mr. Hairston had not wanted Henry to smash Mr. the village just because he was a Jew, but to make Henry lose his innocence.

This novel also has many metaphors and ties to the [[Holocaust]]. This book is very loyal to Robert Cormier's style as it is very short and haunting. It is also in his vein of younger boys discovering darker sides of life and it is left unclear whether the protagonist did the right thing or not.\nThe title originates from a line in Gustave Flaubert's Madame Bovary: \"Language is a cracked kettle on which we beat out tunes for bears to dance to, while all the time we long to move the stars to pity.\"\n\n==Plot summary==\nHenry's family moves to a new town to run away from the memories of their recently passed son, Eddie, who was hit by a car in which the driver instantly drove away, never to be seen.  Henry's father is traumatized by Eddie's death and becomes very quiet and no longer works, while Henry's mother works long hours as a waitress in order to support their family. Another problem Henry faces is that there is no stone to mark Eddie's grave. Henry also contributes to his family by working at a [[grocery store]] for a man named Mr. Hairston, a deceptive old man who makes rude comments about the townsfolk that would walk by his store,\n\nMr. Hairston is a perfectionist, which is why he insults many people, including his wife and beats his daughter, Doris, when she messes something up. He appears to have a special liking to Henry, occasionally giving him candy bars.\n\nEvery day, Henry watches a curious old man leave the crazy house near his apartment and disappear down the street. Henry is very curious about what the old man does but cannot follow him because he was on crutches, and still does not know how to use them.  The day after his leg is healed, Henry follows the crazy man one day to an [[art center]], where he meets him in person and learns his name is Mr. Levine and he is a [[Holocaust]] survivor who lost his family to the SS. He goes to the art center every day to carve out a model of his old hometown town to bring back all the people he had lost, including his wife and kids. Henry and Mr. Levine become very close despite not speaking the same language.\n\nHenry finds out that Mr. Levine is in the \"crazy house\" because the Holocaust had affected him mentally. He still tips his hat randomly, something the Nazis had made him do, as a joke, while was imprisoned. Mr. Levine also frightened very easily, even by Henry, thinking that he was going to beat him, even though he is only 11 because the Nazi guards had beaten him so often.\n\nOne day, Henry tells Mr. Hairston about Mr. Levine's village, who becomes strangely interested. Later, Henry asks Mr. Hairston if he can somehow find him a good gravestone to put over Eddie's grave, which he surprisingly agrees to buy for him, and shows him a sketch of the gravestone, of a bat and baseball, because of Eddie's love for the game. Later on, Henry peeks at the drawing of the grave to find that Mr. Hairston had drawn a large black X on it. Mr. Hairston one day tells Henry that he will be fired at the end of the week for no reason and that he no longer receives the gravestone from him. Henry returns home and finds that his father is being sent to the hospital, to be treated for depression.\n\nUnable to deal with the stress of losing the gravestone, his job, and father in the same day, Henry goes to the art center. He finds that Mr. Levine's village had been given first prize from the city for being the best work of art and was going to be put on display at the town hall.  Mr Levine invites Henry to the ceremony, practicing his English so he could ask Henry in person, instead of it being translated, like in every other conversation they had, and Henry accepts. Further, into the week, Mr. Hairston tells Henry that he will let him keep the job and the headstone at one condition he must destroy Mr. Levine's model village. He also says he had close relationships with Henry's principal and his mother's boss and threatens to have his mother fired and his school reputation collapse if he was not to do what Mr. Hairston wants. The reward, if Henry destroys the replica village, would be a raise of his mom's pay and get her a promotion, him keeping his job, and giving him the headstone. Henry tells no one of his situation, even his mother, to avoid stressing her out more and has to decide what to do on his own. Not knowing what he should do, he hides in the storage room at the art center and finds a mallet just in case he wants to destroy the village, as he is still unable to make up his mind. Henry falls asleep in the storage room and when he wakes up, he finds the art center deserted.  Henry then finds the mallet and brings it above his head ready to smash the village when he decides not to do it.\n\nJust then a rat startles him and he drops the tool on the village, destroying part of it. On his way home, Mr. Hairston waits for him at a closed furniture store in the rain and explains why he wanted the village destroyed: \"Because he is a Jew\" and to give the old man something to do. Henry then says that he does not want the rewards Mr. Hairston offers.  Mr. Hairston insists for Henry to take the rewards saying that they were as important to the deal as Henry smashing the village. This shows that Mr. Hairston had not wanted Henry to smash Mr. the village just because he was a Jew, but to make Henry lose his innocence. Mr. Hairston had been planning this since he hired Henry, which is proven in the quote, \"you must obey all orders, even if you do not like them\". Henry, now knowing why Mr. Hairston so desperately wants him to take the rewards, refuses and quits his job because of this, Henry keeps his innocence, even though he had destroyed the village.\n\nHenry later visits the art center, where Mr. Levine, unfazed by his village being destroyed, continues to work on the village. The ceremony date is changed. George, a man who works at the art center and translates for Henry and Mr. Levine, thinks it was just troublemakers who broke into the craft center to destroy everyone's art but had enough time to destroy only Mr. Levine's before they were scared off. Henry does not tell anyone that he was the one who really destroyed the village. Mr. Levine presents Henry with a carving of him, like the ones he made for all the people that had lived in his village.\n\nHenry later runs into Doris and tells her that she needs to stand up to him and not let him push her or her mother around anymore.\n\nA few weeks afterward, Henry and his family move back to Frenchtown their old town. Henry puts Eddie's old bat and ball on his grave as a replacement for the stone.\n\n==References==\nBook: Tunes For Bears To Dance To by Robert Cormier\n{{Portal|Children and Young Adult Literature}}\n\n{{Robert Cormier}}\n\n[[Category:1992 American novels]]\n[[Category:Novels by Robert Cormier]]\n[[Category:American young adult novels]]\n[[Category:Novels about the Holocaust]]\n", "name_user": "208.180.2.238", "label": "vandal", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eReferences)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunes_for_Bears_to_Dance_To"}

He received an education under a Mr Goldie, but his interest in learning was minimal and his attendance spasmodic.

This fact, together with details of the asset sale was advertised in a hand-bill, a rare copy of which is now in the National Library of Scotland.<ref>{{cite web|title=nls Catnach book liquidation 1801|url=http://www.nls.uk/collections/rarebooks/acquisitions/index.cfm?startRow=256&SORTBY=acqdate}}</ref>\n\nFather managed to restart the business and in 1807 he took on two apprentices, one being his son James, and another was a lad named Mark Smith,<ref  name=Hindley-CatnachMisc/> (see later); a few months afterwards John entered into partnership with [[William Davison (publisher)|William Davison]] to form Catnach and Davison. Unfortunately this partnership did not appear to work, as it lasted less than two years, after which it was dissolved.<ref name=AllansMisc/>\n\nJohn Catnach then moved to [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] in 1808, taking a small shop in Newgate Street in which to restart his business..\n\nHe made some unfortunate decisions, and the result of these plus his own irregular habits (and drinking) and the way he ran his business, caused him to get into debt, until eventually he became a bankrupt and as such ended up in a [[debtors' prison]]. He had managed to send his wife and family to London together with a small wooden printing press, some type etc. and other small items which they managed to secrete away.\n\nOnce in London in 1812, the family moved into lodgings in a court off [[Drury Lane]], where they were joined by John in 1812 on his release, but the accommodation was to prove temporary. Very shortly after, they were evicted and moved firstly to a small shop in [[Wardour Street]], [[Soho]] (while living in [[Charlotte Street]], [[Fitzroy Square]]), followed by another move to [[Chinatown, London#Gerrard Street|Gerard Street]], where, after falling down stairs on 29 August 1813, John Catnach was taken to [[St George's Hospital]], [[Hyde Park Corner]], where he died on 4 December 1813.\n\n==Family re-united ==\nJames Catnach who had been working in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], joined the family several weeks after his father\u2019s death, and shortly after this, the family again moved. It was from the little shop and parlour at 2 Monmouth Court, [[Seven Dials, London|Seven Dials]] that James Catnach set up his printing business c. 1813 using only his father\u2019s old wooden printing press. He was now supporting his mother and family and so had even more incentive to succeed, and so by very careful management he gradually built up a very solid yet lucrative business.\n\nHis main-stay was small histories, ballad poetry, broadsides, catch-pennies, and penny awfuls. And the customers who were connected with the catchpenny trade and who frequented his place of business were, in the main, vagrants, miscreants, and the underclasses of society.\n\nAfter the Napoleonic war, many printers cashed in on the public\u2019s demand for news and printed small penny papers, each with a topical story. In 1818 James Catnach printed an edition on a small sheet in which he suggested that certain local butchers in [[Drury Lane]] had received two human bodies which they intended to sell as pork. In the ensuing court case he eventually pleaded guilty and was sent to [[Clerkenwell Prison]] for 6 months, during which time his mother and sisters manned the presses.\n\nBusiness improved and c. 1820 James was running 3 presses, all working flat out. By the end of the 1830s James Catnach was at the height of his power, influence and wealth, never employing more than 4 and with only 6 presses, he had a phenomenal turnover, sometimes not even having time to count the number of copies coming of the presses.\n\n== Retirement and early death ==\nJames Catnach retired in 1838 to a property which he had bought in preparation for this event.\nIt consisted of the \"Lion Inn\", a disused public house and its grounds at Dancer\u2019s Hill, [[South Mimms]], near [[Chipping Barnet|Barnet]] in [[Middlesex]], leaving the business to his sister (now) Mrs. Anne (baptised Nancy) Ryle.\nHe never married and kept his [[Northumberland]] burr.\n\nHe did not long survive his retirement and was buried in [[Highgate Cemetery]], in one of the two plots that his sister had purchased earlier. The official number of the grave is 256, Square 29, over which is placed a flat stone, inscribed : \u2014\n\nIN MEMORY OF\n\nJAMES CATNACH,\n\nOf Dancer's Hill.\n\nDIED 1 February 1841,\n\nAged 49.\n\nHe left somewhere between \u00a33,000 and \u00a310,000 depending upon which story you want to believe.\n\n== Mark Smith ==\nWhen the two partners, John Catnach and [[William Davison (publisher)|William Davison]] dissolved the partnership, the indentures on son James Catnach and the lad Mark Smith became void, and they afterwards worked together as \"improvers\" in their trade with Mr Joseph Graham, a printer from Fenkle Street in Alnwick.\nMark Smith moved away to London and later, on learning that the family had arrived there, went to visit them at their lodgings in a court off [[Drury Lane]]. There he helped to set up the press in readiness for John Catnach's freeing from prison. He kept in touch, helped out the family by providing firstly utensils, later paying off the rent arrears and whilst John was in hospital, by working at night-time to finish off the jobs on his books.\nJames Catnach kept in touch with Mark and visited him in [[Alnwick]] on more than one occasion.\n\n== Works ==\nThese include:<br />\nOne class of literature which Jemmy Catnach made almost his own, was children's farthing and halfpenny books.
