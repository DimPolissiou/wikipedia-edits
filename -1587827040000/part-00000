The Allies promoted the alliance as a means to control [[Nazi Germany|German]], [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian]] aggression.\n\nAt the start of the war on 1 September 1939, the Allies consisted of [[French Third Republic|France]], [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] and the [[United Kingdom]], as well as their [[Dependent territory|dependent states]], such as [[British Raj|British India]].

''The Oxford Companion to World War II'' (2005), pp 29, 1176</ref>\n{{TOC limit|4}}\n\n==Origins and creation==\n{{Main|Causes of World War II|Grand Alliance (World War II)}}\n\nThe origins of the Allied powers stem from the [[Allies of World War I]] and cooperation of the victorious powers at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919]]. [[German Empire|Germany]] resented signing [[Treaty of Versailles]]. The new [[Weimar Republic]]'s legitimacy became shaken. However, the 1920s were peaceful.\n\nWith the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] and the ensuing [[Great Depression]], political unrest in Europe soared including the rise in support of [[Revanchism|revanchist]] nationalists in Germany who blamed the severity of the economic crisis on the Treaty of Versailles. By the early 1930s, the [[Nazi Party]] led by [[Adolf Hitler]] became the dominant revanchist movement in Germany and Hitler and the Nazis [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|gained power]] in 1933. The Nazi regime demanded the immediate cancellation of the Treaty of Versailles and made claims to German-populated Austria, and German-populated territories of Czechoslovakia. The likelihood of war was high, and the question was whether it could be avoided through strategies such as [[appeasement]].\n\nIn Asia, when [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|Japan seized Manchuria]] in 1931, the [[League of Nations]] condemned it for aggression against China. Japan responded by leaving the League of Nations in March 1933. After four quiet years, the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]] erupted in 1937 with Japanese forces invading China. The League of Nations condemned Japan's actions and initiated sanctions on Japan. The United States, in particular, was angered at Japan and sought to support China.\n\n{{multiple image\n | border = infobox\n | image_gap = 20\n | caption_align = center\n| align = right \n| direction = horizontal \n| header = \n| header_align = left/right/center \n| footer = \n| footer_align = left \n| image1 = Poland First To Fight.jpg \n| width1 = 150 \n| caption1 = British wartime poster supporting Poland after the [[Invasion of Poland|German invasion of the country]] ([[European theatre of World War II|European theater]]) \n| image2 = \"China-First to Fight - NARA - 513567.jpg \n| width2 = 150 \n| caption2 = American wartime poster promoting aid to China during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] ([[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific theater]])\n}}\nIn March 1939, [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Germany took over Czechoslovakia]], violating the [[Munich Agreement]] signed six months before, and demonstrating that the appeasement policy was a failure. Britain and France decided that Hitler had no intention to uphold diplomatic agreements and responded by preparing for war. On 31 March 1939, Britain formed the [[Anglo-Polish military alliance]] in an effort to avert a German attack on the country. Also, the French had a long-standing [[Franco-Polish alliance (1921)|alliance with Poland since 1921]]. The [[Soviet Union]] sought an alliance with the western powers, but Hitler ended the risk of a war with Stalin by signing the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|Nazi\u2013Soviet non-aggression pact]] in August 1939. The agreement secretly divided the independent nations of Eastern Europe between the two powers and assured adequate oil supplies for the German war machine. On 1 September 1939, [[Invasion of Poland|Germany invaded Poland]]; two days later Britain and France declared war on Germany. Then, on 17 September 1939, the [[Soviet invasion of Poland|Soviet Union invaded Poland]] from the east. A [[Polish government-in-exile]] was set up and it continued to be one of the Allies, a model followed by other occupied countries. After a quiet winter, Germany in April 1940 invaded and quickly defeated Denmark, Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands and France. Britain and its Empire stood alone against Hitler and Mussolini. In June 1941, Hitler broke the non-aggression agreement with Stalin and Germany invaded the Soviet Union. In December, Japan attacked the US and Britain. The main lines of World War II had formed.\n\n==Major affiliated state combatants==\n{{Main|Four Policemen|Diplomatic history of World War II}}\n\nDuring December 1941, U.S. President [[Franklin D.

Two West African and one East African division served in the [[Burma Campaign]].\n\n[[Southern Rhodesia]] was a self-governing colony, having received [[responsible government]] in 1923. It was not a sovereign dominion. It governed itself internally and controlled its own armed forces, but had no diplomatic autonomy, and, therefore, was officially at war as soon as Britain was at war. The Southern Rhodesian colonial government issued a symbolic declaration of war nevertheless on 3 September 1939, which made no difference diplomatically, but preceded the declarations of war made by all other British dominions and colonies.<ref>{{cite book|title=So Far And No Further!

[[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] was ruled as a royal colony in 1933\u201349, run by a governor appointed by London who made the decisions regarding Newfoundland.\n\n======In Asia======\n{{Further|India in World War II|Indian Army during World War II}}\n\n[[Presidencies and provinces of British India|British India]] included the areas and peoples covered by later [[India]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Pakistan]] and (until 1937) [[Myanmar|Burma/Myanmar]], which later became a separate colony.\n\n[[British Malaya]] covers the areas of [[Peninsular Malaysia]] and [[Singapore in the Straits Settlements|Singapore]], while [[British Borneo]] covers the area of [[Brunei]], including [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]] of Malaysia.\n\nTerritories controlled by the [[Colonial Office]], namely the [[Crown colony|Crown Colonies]], were controlled politically by the UK and therefore also entered hostilities with Britain's declaration of war. At the outbreak of World War II, the [[British Indian Army]] numbered 205,000 men. Later during World War II, the [[Indian Army during World War II|Indian Army]] became the largest all-volunteer force in history, rising to over 2.5 million men in size.\n\nIndian soldiers earned 30 [[Victoria Cross]]es during the Second World War. It suffered 87,000 military casualties (more than any Crown colony but fewer than the United Kingdom). The UK suffered 382,000 military casualties.\n\nProtectorates included: [[Sheikhdom of Kuwait|Kuwait]] was a protectorate of the United Kingdom formally established in 1899. The [[Trucial States]] were protectorates in the Persian Gulf.\n\n[[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] was a mandate dependency created in the peace agreements after [[World War I]] from former territory of the [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Mandatory Iraq|Iraq]].\n\n======In Europe======\n\nThe [[Cyprus Regiment]] was formed by the British Government during the Second World War and made part of the British Army structure. It was mostly [[Greek Cypriots|Greek Cypriot]] volunteers and Turkish speaking Cypriot inhabitants of Cyprus but also included other Commonwealth nationalities. On a brief visit to Cyprus in 1943, Winston Churchill praised the \"soldiers of the Cyprus Regiment who have served honourably on many fields from Libya to Dunkirk\". About 30,000 Cypriots served in the Cyprus Regiment. The regiment was involved in action from the very start and served at [[Dunkirk]], in the Greek Campaign ([[Battle of Greece]]) (about 600 soldiers were captured in [[Kalamata]] in 1941), North Africa ([[Operation Compass]]), France, the Middle East and Italy. Many soldiers were taken prisoner especially at the beginning of the war and were interned in various POW camps ([[Stalag]]) including Lamsdorf ([[Stalag VIII-B]]), Stalag IVC at Wistritz bei Teplitz and Stalag 4b near Most in the Czech Republic. The soldiers captured in Kalamata were transported by train to prisoner of war camps.\n\n===China===\n{{Main|Second Sino-Japanese War|l1 = Military history of China during World War II}}\n\nIn the 1920s the Soviet Union provided military assistance to the [[Kuomintang]], or the Nationalists and helped reorganize their party along [[Leninist]] lines: a unification of party, state, and army. In exchange the Nationalists agreed to let members of the [[Chinese Communist Party]] join the Nationalists on an individual basis. However, following the nominal unification of China at the end of the [[Northern Expedition]] in 1928, [[Generalissimo]] [[Chiang Kai-shek]] purged leftists from his party and fought against the revolting Chinese Communist Party, former [[warlord]]s, and other militarist factions. A fragmented China provided easy opportunities for Japan to gain territories piece by piece without engaging in [[total war]]. Following the 1931 [[Mukden Incident]], the puppet state of [[Manchukuo]] was established. Throughout the early to mid-1930s, Chiang's anti-communist and anti-militarist campaigns continued while he fought small, incessant conflicts against Japan, usually followed by unfavorable settlements and concessions after military defeats.\n\nIn 1936 Chiang was forced to cease his [[Nanjing decade|anti-communist military campaigns]] after [[Xian incident|his kidnap and release]] by [[Zhang Xueliang]], and reluctantly formed [[Second United Front (China)|a nominal alliance]] with the Communists, while the Communists agreed to fight under the nominal command of the Nationalists against the Japanese. Following the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]] of 7 July 1937, China and Japan became embroiled in a full-scale war. The Soviet Union, wishing to keep China in the fight against Japan, supplied China with military assistance until 1941, when it [[Soviet-Japanese Treaty (1941)|signed a non-aggression pact with Japan]]. Continuous clashes between the Communists and Nationalists behind enemy lines cumulated in [[New Fourth Army Incident|a major military conflict]] between these two former allies that effectively ended their cooperation against the Japanese, and China had been divided between the internationally recognized [[Nationalist Government|Nationalist China]] under the leadership of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and [[Communist-controlled China (1927\u201349)|Communist China]] under the leadership of [[Mao Zedong]] until the Japanese surrendered in 1945.\n\n====Factions====\n\n=====Nationalists=====\n{{Main|Nationalist Government}}\n[[File:Kmtarmy.JPG|thumb|upright|Soldiers of the [[National Revolutionary Army]] associated with Nationalist China, during the Second Sino-Japanese War]]\n\nPrior to the alliance of Germany and Italy to Japan, the Nationalist Government held close relations with both Germany and Italy. In the early 1930s, [[Sino-German cooperation]] existed between the Nationalist Government and Germany in military and industrial matters. Nazi Germany provided the largest proportion of Chinese arms imports and technical expertise. Relations between the Nationalist Government and Italy during the 1930s varied, however even after the Nationalist Government followed League of Nations sanctions against Italy for [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|its invasion]] of [[Ethiopian Empire|Ethiopia]], the international sanctions proved unsuccessful, and relations between the Fascist government in Italy and the Nationalist Government in China returned to normal shortly afterwards.<ref name=\"G.

The United States opposed Japan's invasion of China in 1937 that it considered an illegal violation of China's [[sovereignty]], and offered the Nationalist Government diplomatic, economic, and military assistance during its war against Japan. In particular, the United States sought to bring the Japanese war effort to a complete halt by imposing a full embargo on all trade between the United States to Japan, Japan was dependent on the United States for 80 percent of its [[petroleum]], resulting in an economic and military crisis for Japan that could not continue its war effort with China without access to petroleum.<ref>Euan Graham.

China fought the Japanese Empire before joining the Allies in the [[Pacific War]]. Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek thought Allied victory was assured with the entrance of the United States into the war, and he declared war on Germany and the other Axis nations. However, Allied aid remained low because the [[Burma Road]] was closed and the Allies suffered a series of military defeats against Japan early on in the campaign. General [[Sun Li-jen]] led the R.O.C. forces to the relief of 7,000 British forces trapped by the Japanese in the [[Battle of Yenangyaung]]. He then reconquered North Burma and re-established the land route to China by the [[Ledo Road]]. But the bulk of military aid did not arrive until the spring of 1945. More than 1.5 million Japanese troops were trapped in the China Theatre, troops that otherwise could have been deployed elsewhere if China had collapsed and made a separate peace.\n\n=====Communists=====\n{{Main|Communist-controlled China (1927\u201349)}}\n[[File:Ba lu bing gong chang.jpg|thumb|Soldiers of the [[People's Liberation Army|First Workers' and Peasants' Army]] associated with Communist China, during the Sino-Japanese War]]\n[[File:Hundred Regiments Offensive 1940.jpg|thumb|Victorious Chinese Communist soldiers holding the [[flag of the Republic of China]] during the [[Hundred Regiments Offensive]]]]\n\nCommunist China had been tacitly supported by the [[Soviet Union]] since the 1920s, though the Soviet Union diplomatically recognised the Republic of China, [[Joseph Stalin]] supported cooperation between the Nationalists and the Communists\u2014including pressuring the Nationalist Government to grant the Communists state and military positions in the government.<ref name=\"Frederic J.

During the ensuing fighting, Belgian forces fought alongside French and British forces against the invaders. While the British and French were struggling against [[Blitzkrieg|the fast German advance]] elsewhere on the front, the Belgian forces were pushed into a pocket to the north. Finally, on 28 May, the [[Leopold III of Belgium|King Leopold III]] surrendered himself and his military to the Germans, having decided the Allied cause was lost. The legal Belgian government was reformed as [[Belgian Government in Exile|a government in exile in London]]. Belgian troops and pilots continued to fight on the Allied side as the [[Free Belgian Forces]]. Belgium itself was occupied, but a sizeable [[Belgian Resistance|Resistance]] was formed and was loosely coordinated by the government in exile and other Allied powers.\n\nBritish and Canadian troops arrived in Belgium in September 1944 and the capital, [[Brussels]], was liberated on 6 September. Because of the [[Ardennes Offensive]], the country was only fully liberated in early 1945.\n\n====Colonies and dependencies====\n\nBelgium held the colony of the [[Belgian Congo]] and the League of Nations mandate of [[Ruanda-Urundi]]. The Belgian Congo was not occupied and remained loyal to the Allies as an important economic asset while its deposits of uranium were useful to the Allied efforts to develop the atomic bomb. Troops from the Belgian Congo participated in the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]] against the Italians. The colonial ''[[Force Publique]]'' also served in other theatres including Madagascar, the Middle-East, India and Burma within British units.\n\n===Brazil===\n{{Main|Brazilian Expeditionary Force}}Initially, [[Vargas Era|Brazil]] maintained a position of neutrality, trading with both the Allies and the [[Axis powers|Axis]], while Brazilian president [[Get\u00falio Vargas]]'s quasi-[[Fascist]] policies indicated a leaning toward the Axis powers. However, as the war progressed, trade with the Axis countries became almost impossible and the United States initiated forceful diplomatic and economic efforts to bring Brazil onto the Allied side.\n\nAt the beginning of 1942, Brazil permitted the United States to set up air bases on its territory, especially in [[Natal, Rio Grande do Norte|Natal]], strategically located at the easternmost corner of the [[South American]] continent, and on 28&nbsp;January the country severed diplomatic relations with Germany, Japan and Italy. After that, 36 Brazilian merchant ships were sunk by the German and Italian navies, which led the Brazilian government to declare war against Germany and Italy on 22&nbsp;August 1942.\n\nBrazil then sent a 25,700 strong [[Expeditionary warfare|Expeditionary Force]] to Europe that fought mainly on the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)#Allied advance into Northern Italy|Italian front]], from September 1944 to May 1945. Also, the [[Brazilian Navy]] and [[Brazilian Air Force|Air Force]] acted in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] from the middle of 1942 until the end of the war.

The Provisional Government also declared war against the [[Empire of Japan]] on 10 December 1941. The Provisional Government is also the first democratic government of [[Korea]].\n\nThe KLA participated in the battles ongoing in China with the [[Kuomintang]] forces.

The [[Office of Strategic Services]] of the United States also promised to assist the KLA with warplanes, submarines, and airborne troops during the operation. However, the plan failed due to the early surrender of Japan on 15 August 1945. The Provisional Government also faced heavy opposition from the [[United States Army Military Government in Korea]] after World War II. In addition, other governments in the [[Treaty of San Francisco]] did not recognize the Provisional Government as a member of the Allies.

[[German Empire|Germany]] resented signing [[Treaty of Versailles]]. The new [[Weimar Republic]]'s legitimacy became shaken. However, the 1920s were peaceful.\n\nWith the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] and the ensuing [[Great Depression]], political unrest in Europe soared including the rise in support of [[Revanchism|revanchist]] nationalists in Germany who blamed the severity of the economic crisis on the Treaty of Versailles. By the early 1930s, the [[Nazi Party]] led by [[Adolf Hitler]] became the dominant revanchist movement in Germany and Hitler and the Nazis [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|gained power]] in 1933. The Nazi regime demanded the immediate cancellation of the Treaty of Versailles and made claims to German-populated Austria, and German-populated territories of Czechoslovakia. The likelihood of war was high, and the question was whether it could be avoided through strategies such as [[appeasement]].\n\nIn Asia, when [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|Japan seized Manchuria]] in 1931, the [[League of Nations]] condemned it for aggression against China. Japan responded by leaving the League of Nations in March 1933. After four quiet years, the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]] erupted in 1937 with Japanese forces invading China. The League of Nations condemned Japan's actions and initiated sanctions on Japan. The United States, in particular, was angered at Japan and sought to support China.\n\n{{multiple image\n | border = infobox\n | image_gap = 20\n | caption_align = center\n| align = right \n| direction = horizontal \n| header = \n| header_align = left/right/center \n| footer = \n| footer_align = left \n| image1 = Poland First To Fight.jpg \n| width1 = 150 \n| caption1 = British wartime poster supporting Poland after the [[Invasion of Poland|German invasion of the country]] ([[European theatre of World War II|European theater]]) \n| image2 = \"China-First to Fight - NARA - 513567.jpg \n| width2 = 150 \n| caption2 = American wartime poster promoting aid to China during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] ([[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific theater]])\n}}\nIn March 1939, [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Germany took over Czechoslovakia]], violating the [[Munich Agreement]] signed six months before, and demonstrating that the appeasement policy was a failure. Britain and France decided that Hitler had no intention to uphold diplomatic agreements and responded by preparing for war. On 31 March 1939, Britain formed the [[Anglo-Polish military alliance]] in an effort to avert a German attack on the country. Also, the French had a long-standing [[Franco-Polish alliance (1921)|alliance with Poland since 1921]]. The [[Soviet Union]] sought an alliance with the western powers, but Hitler ended the risk of a war with Stalin by signing the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|Nazi\u2013Soviet non-aggression pact]] in August 1939. The agreement secretly divided the independent nations of Eastern Europe between the two powers and assured adequate oil supplies for the German war machine. On 1 September 1939, [[Invasion of Poland|Germany invaded Poland]]; two days later Britain and France declared war on Germany. Then, on 17 September 1939, the [[Soviet invasion of Poland|Soviet Union invaded Poland]] from the east. A [[Polish government-in-exile]] was set up and it continued to be one of the Allies, a model followed by other occupied countries. After a quiet winter, Germany in April 1940 invaded and quickly defeated Denmark, Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands and France. Britain and its Empire stood alone against Hitler and Mussolini. In June 1941, Hitler broke the non-aggression agreement with Stalin and Germany invaded the Soviet Union. In December, Japan attacked the US and Britain. The main lines of World War II had formed.\n\n==Major affiliated state combatants==\n{{Main|Four Policemen|Diplomatic history of World War II}}\n\nDuring December 1941, U.S. President [[Franklin D.

It was not a sovereign dominion. It governed itself internally and controlled its own armed forces, but had no diplomatic autonomy, and, therefore, was officially at war as soon as Britain was at war. The Southern Rhodesian colonial government issued a symbolic declaration of war nevertheless on 3 September 1939, which made no difference diplomatically, but preceded the declarations of war made by all other British dominions and colonies.<ref>{{cite book|title=So Far And No Further!

At the outbreak of World War II, the [[British Indian Army]] numbered 205,000 men. Later during World War II, the [[Indian Army during World War II|Indian Army]] became the largest all-volunteer force in history, rising to over 2.5 million men in size.\n\nIndian soldiers earned 30 [[Victoria Cross]]es during the Second World War. It suffered 87,000 military casualties (more than any Crown colony but fewer than the United Kingdom).

It was mostly [[Greek Cypriots|Greek Cypriot]] volunteers and Turkish speaking Cypriot inhabitants of Cyprus but also included other Commonwealth nationalities. On a brief visit to Cyprus in 1943, Winston Churchill praised the \"soldiers of the Cyprus Regiment who have served honourably on many fields from Libya to Dunkirk\". About 30,000 Cypriots served in the Cyprus Regiment. The regiment was involved in action from the very start and served at [[Dunkirk]], in the Greek Campaign ([[Battle of Greece]]) (about 600 soldiers were captured in [[Kalamata]] in 1941), North Africa ([[Operation Compass]]), France, the Middle East and Italy. Many soldiers were taken prisoner especially at the beginning of the war and were interned in various POW camps ([[Stalag]]) including Lamsdorf ([[Stalag VIII-B]]), Stalag IVC at Wistritz bei Teplitz and Stalag 4b near Most in the Czech Republic. The soldiers captured in Kalamata were transported by train to prisoner of war camps.\n\n===China===\n{{Main|Second Sino-Japanese War|l1 = Military history of China during World War II}}\n\nIn the 1920s the Soviet Union provided military assistance to the [[Kuomintang]], or the Nationalists and helped reorganize their party along [[Leninist]] lines: a unification of party, state, and army. In exchange the Nationalists agreed to let members of the [[Chinese Communist Party]] join the Nationalists on an individual basis. However, following the nominal unification of China at the end of the [[Northern Expedition]] in 1928, [[Generalissimo]] [[Chiang Kai-shek]] purged leftists from his party and fought against the revolting Chinese Communist Party, former [[warlord]]s, and other militarist factions. A fragmented China provided easy opportunities for Japan to gain territories piece by piece without engaging in [[total war]]. Following the 1931 [[Mukden Incident]], the puppet state of [[Manchukuo]] was established. Throughout the early to mid-1930s, Chiang's anti-communist and anti-militarist campaigns continued while he fought small, incessant conflicts against Japan, usually followed by unfavorable settlements and concessions after military defeats.\n\nIn 1936 Chiang was forced to cease his [[Nanjing decade|anti-communist military campaigns]] after [[Xian incident|his kidnap and release]] by [[Zhang Xueliang]], and reluctantly formed [[Second United Front (China)|a nominal alliance]] with the Communists, while the Communists agreed to fight under the nominal command of the Nationalists against the Japanese. Following the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]] of 7 July 1937, China and Japan became embroiled in a full-scale war. The Soviet Union, wishing to keep China in the fight against Japan, supplied China with military assistance until 1941, when it [[Soviet-Japanese Treaty (1941)|signed a non-aggression pact with Japan]]. Continuous clashes between the Communists and Nationalists behind enemy lines cumulated in [[New Fourth Army Incident|a major military conflict]] between these two former allies that effectively ended their cooperation against the Japanese, and China had been divided between the internationally recognized [[Nationalist Government|Nationalist China]] under the leadership of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and [[Communist-controlled China (1927\u201349)|Communist China]] under the leadership of [[Mao Zedong]] until the Japanese surrendered in 1945.\n\n====Factions====\n\n=====Nationalists=====\n{{Main|Nationalist Government}}\n[[File:Kmtarmy.JPG|thumb|upright|Soldiers of the [[National Revolutionary Army]] associated with Nationalist China, during the Second Sino-Japanese War]]\n\nPrior to the alliance of Germany and Italy to Japan, the Nationalist Government held close relations with both Germany and Italy. In the early 1930s, [[Sino-German cooperation]] existed between the Nationalist Government and Germany in military and industrial matters. Nazi Germany provided the largest proportion of Chinese arms imports and technical expertise. Relations between the Nationalist Government and Italy during the 1930s varied, however even after the Nationalist Government followed League of Nations sanctions against Italy for [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|its invasion]] of [[Ethiopian Empire|Ethiopia]], the international sanctions proved unsuccessful, and relations between the Fascist government in Italy and the Nationalist Government in China returned to normal shortly afterwards.<ref name=\"G.

The United States opposed Japan's invasion of China in 1937 that it considered an illegal violation of China's [[sovereignty]], and offered the Nationalist Government diplomatic, economic, and military assistance during its war against Japan. In particular, the United States sought to bring the Japanese war effort to a complete halt by imposing a full embargo on all trade between the United States to Japan, Japan was dependent on the United States for 80 percent of its [[petroleum]], resulting in an economic and military crisis for Japan that could not continue its war effort with China without access to petroleum.<ref>Euan Graham.

China fought the Japanese Empire before joining the Allies in the [[Pacific War]]. Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek thought Allied victory was assured with the entrance of the United States into the war, and he declared war on Germany and the other Axis nations. However, Allied aid remained low because the [[Burma Road]] was closed and the Allies suffered a series of military defeats against Japan early on in the campaign. General [[Sun Li-jen]] led the R.O.C. forces to the relief of 7,000 British forces trapped by the Japanese in the [[Battle of Yenangyaung]]. He then reconquered North Burma and re-established the land route to China by the [[Ledo Road]]. But the bulk of military aid did not arrive until the spring of 1945. More than 1.5 million Japanese troops were trapped in the China Theatre, troops that otherwise could have been deployed elsewhere if China had collapsed and made a separate peace.\n\n=====Communists=====\n{{Main|Communist-controlled China (1927\u201349)}}\n[[File:Ba lu bing gong chang.jpg|thumb|Soldiers of the [[People's Liberation Army|First Workers' and Peasants' Army]] associated with Communist China, during the Sino-Japanese War]]\n[[File:Hundred Regiments Offensive 1940.jpg|thumb|Victorious Chinese Communist soldiers holding the [[flag of the Republic of China]] during the [[Hundred Regiments Offensive]]]]\n\nCommunist China had been tacitly supported by the [[Soviet Union]] since the 1920s, though the Soviet Union diplomatically recognised the Republic of China, [[Joseph Stalin]] supported cooperation between the Nationalists and the Communists\u2014including pressuring the Nationalist Government to grant the Communists state and military positions in the government.<ref name=\"Frederic J.

Roosevelt]]. This was followed by Germany and Italy declaring war on the United States on 11&nbsp;December, bringing the country into the European theatre.\n\nThe US-led Allied forces in the Pacific theatre against Japanese forces from 1941 to 1945. From 1943 to 1945, the US-led and coordinated the Western Allies' war effort in Europe under the leadership of General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]].\n\nThe surprise attack on Pearl Harbor followed by Japan's swift attacks on Allied locations throughout the Pacific, resulted in major US losses in the first several months in the war, including losing control of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Philippines]], [[Guam]], [[Wake Island]] and several Aleutian islands including [[Attu Island|Attu]] and [[Kiska]] to Japanese forces. American naval forces attained some early successes against Japan. One was the bombing of Japanese industrial centres in the [[Doolittle Raid]]. Another was repelling a Japanese invasion of [[Port Moresby]] in [[New Guinea]] during the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]].<ref>Chris Henry. The Battle of the Coral Sea. London, England, UK: Compendium Publishing; Annapolis, Maryland, US: Naval Institute Press, 2003.

(275)</ref> However American forces managed to sink four of Japan's six large aircraft carriers that had initiated the attack on Pearl Harbor along with other attacks on Allied forces. Afterwards the US began an offensive against Japanese-captured positions. The [[Guadalcanal Campaign]] from 1942 to 1943 was a major contention point where Allied and Japanese forces struggled to gain control of [[Guadalcanal]].\n\n====Colonies and dependencies====\n\n=====In the Americas and the Pacific=====\n\nThe United States held multiple dependencies in the Americas, such as [[Territory of Alaska|Alaska]], the [[Panama Canal Zone]], [[Puerto Rico]], and the [[Virgin Islands of the United States|U.S. Virgin Islands]].\n\nIn the Pacific it held multiple island dependencies such as [[American Samoa]], [[Guam]], [[Territory of Hawaii|Hawaii]], [[Midway Islands]], [[Wake Island]] and others. These dependencies were directly involved in the Pacific campaign of the war.\n\n=====In Asia=====\n[[File:FortMcKinley.jpg|thumb|Philippine Scouts at [[Fort William McKinley]] firing a 37&nbsp;mm anti-tank gun in training]]\n\nThe [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]] was a sovereign protectorate referred to as an \"associated state\" of the United States.

During the ensuing fighting, Belgian forces fought alongside French and British forces against the invaders. While the British and French were struggling against [[Blitzkrieg|the fast German advance]] elsewhere on the front, the Belgian forces were pushed into a pocket to the north. Finally, on 28 May, the [[Leopold III of Belgium|King Leopold III]] surrendered himself and his military to the Germans, having decided the Allied cause was lost. The legal Belgian government was reformed as [[Belgian Government in Exile|a government in exile in London]]. Belgian troops and pilots continued to fight on the Allied side as the [[Free Belgian Forces]]. Belgium itself was occupied, but a sizeable [[Belgian Resistance|Resistance]] was formed and was loosely coordinated by the government in exile and other Allied powers.\n\nBritish and Canadian troops arrived in Belgium in September 1944 and the capital, [[Brussels]], was liberated on 6 September. Because of the [[Ardennes Offensive]], the country was only fully liberated in early 1945.\n\n====Colonies and dependencies====\n\nBelgium held the colony of the [[Belgian Congo]] and the League of Nations mandate of [[Ruanda-Urundi]]. The Belgian Congo was not occupied and remained loyal to the Allies as an important economic asset while its deposits of uranium were useful to the Allied efforts to develop the atomic bomb. Troops from the Belgian Congo participated in the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]] against the Italians. The colonial ''[[Force Publique]]'' also served in other theatres including Madagascar, the Middle-East, India and Burma within British units.\n\n===Brazil===\n{{Main|Brazilian Expeditionary Force}}Initially, [[Vargas Era|Brazil]] maintained a position of neutrality, trading with both the Allies and the [[Axis powers|Axis]], while Brazilian president [[Get\u00falio Vargas]]'s quasi-[[Fascist]] policies indicated a leaning toward the Axis powers. However, as the war progressed, trade with the Axis countries became almost impossible and the United States initiated forceful diplomatic and economic efforts to bring Brazil onto the Allied side.\n\nAt the beginning of 1942, Brazil permitted the United States to set up air bases on its territory, especially in [[Natal, Rio Grande do Norte|Natal]], strategically located at the easternmost corner of the [[South American]] continent, and on 28&nbsp;January the country severed diplomatic relations with Germany, Japan and Italy. After that, 36 Brazilian merchant ships were sunk by the German and Italian navies, which led the Brazilian government to declare war against Germany and Italy on 22&nbsp;August 1942.\n\nBrazil then sent a 25,700 strong [[Expeditionary warfare|Expeditionary Force]] to Europe that fought mainly on the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)#Allied advance into Northern Italy|Italian front]], from September 1944 to May 1945. Also, the [[Brazilian Navy]] and [[Brazilian Air Force|Air Force]] acted in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] from the middle of 1942 until the end of the war. Brazil was the only South American country to send troops to fight in the European theatre in the Second World War.\n\n===Canada===\n{{Main|Declaration of war by Canada#Germany|Military history of Canada during World War II}}\n\nCanada was a sovereign Dominion under the [[Monarchy of Canada|Canadian monarchy]], as per the Statute of Westminster 1931.

The Netherlands was liberated by Canadian, British, American and other allied forces during the campaigns of 1944 and 1945. The [[Royal Netherlands Motorized Infantry Brigade|Princess Irene Brigade]], formed from escapees from the German invasion, took part in several actions in 1944 in Arromanches and in 1945 in the Netherlands.

Great Britain, France and [[Polish Armed Forces in the West|Polish forces in exile]] supported Norwegian forces against the invaders but without a specific agreement. Norway's cabinet signed a military agreement with Britain on 28 May 1941. This agreement allowed all Norwegian forces in exile to operate under UK command.

The Provisional Government had governmental tasks and created important organizations for their independence movement, such as the [[Korean Liberation Army]] (KLA) on 17 September 1940. The Provisional Government also declared war against the [[Empire of Japan]] on 10 December 1941. The Provisional Government is also the first democratic government of [[Korea]].\n\nThe KLA participated in the battles ongoing in China with the [[Kuomintang]] forces. In 1943, KLA underground activists, co-operating with British forces in [[British Burma|Burma]] and [[British Raj|India]], initiated joint operations with British forces.\n\nThe KLA failed to initiate Operation Eagle, a plan to liberate the Korean Peninsula by first attacking the capital region ([[Seoul]] and [[Incheon]]), on 18 August 1945. The [[Office of Strategic Services]] of the United States also promised to assist the KLA with warplanes, submarines, and airborne troops during the operation. However, the plan failed due to the early surrender of Japan on 15 August 1945. The Provisional Government also faced heavy opposition from the [[United States Army Military Government in Korea]] after World War II. In addition, other governments in the [[Treaty of San Francisco]] did not recognize the Provisional Government as a member of the Allies. The government of the [[First Republic of Korea|Republic of Korea]] was established on 15 August 1948, under President [[Syngman Rhee]], and the Provisional Government was disbanded officially.\n\n==United Nations==\n\n===Declaration by United Nations===\n{{Main|Declaration by United Nations}}\n[[File:United Nations Fight for Freedom poster.jpg|thumb|upright|Wartime poster for the [[Declaration by United Nations|United Nations]], created in 1941 by the [[United States Office of War Information|U.S. Office of War Information]]]]\n\nThe alliance was formalised in the Declaration by United Nations on 1&nbsp;January 1942.

From left to right: [[Joe Thomas (actor)|Joe Thomas]], [[Simon Bird]], [[James Buckley (actor)|James Buckley]] and [[Blake Harrison]]]]\n\n===Main cast===\nThe four main characters are seen in every episode as well as the 2011 and 2014 films. They consist of:\n* '''[[Will McKenzie]]''' ([[Danny Arnold]]) is the programme's [[Protagonist|central character]], with his voiceover introducing and concluding each episode. In the first episode, he has been transferred from a [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|private school]], following his parents' [[divorce]], to Rudge Park Comprehensive, where he eventually befriends the others. He is an unconventional hero \u2013 although he is generally the most intelligent and logical of the group, he is prone to making bad choices and his [[sarcasm]] occasionally leads to him making offensive and shocking statements. Will is diligent, mild-mannered and eager to get into a good university. However, he is shown to be romantically awkward, and [[Pessimism|pessimistic]] about his chances, due to his awareness of his lack of any kind of good looks or [[Social graces|social grace]].\n* '''Simon Cooper''' ([[Joe Thomas (actor)|Richard Mills]]) is the most [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynical]] and hot-headed of the group, being prone to bouts of hysterical swearing at the slightest provocation \u2013 such as gentle goading, family rules, or even well-meaning advice \u2013 from his family or peers. However, he is also shown in several scenes to be the most trustworthy of the group, and he maintains a closer relationship with Will than any of the others. Simon considers himself to be the most romantic of the boys, his [[On-again, off-again relationship|on-off relationship]] with Carli propelling many of the plots.\n* '''Jay Cartwright''' ([[James Buckley (actor)|Zac McCallum]]) is the most immature and arrogant of the boys. He is also the most vulgar and harbours a generally [[Misogyny|misogynistic]] outlook. He is obsessed with sex, with almost all his comments being about the subject. He falsely claims to be the most sexually experienced of the group. He frequently tells wild and fictitious stories about his experiences (sexual or otherwise), and hands out highly ridiculous advice (such as claiming that inserting the [[testicles]] into the vagina during sex is something \"some girls like and some don't\"), which demonstrates that in reality he has very little understanding of the subject discussed, also substituting crude nicknames for the vagina. In fact, he is actually the least sexually experienced of the group, frequently relying on [[pornography]] to attain gratification, as he finds it difficult to engage with girls. In addition to his sexual stories, Jay compulsively lies about just about anything to make himself seem interesting, no matter how unbelievable.\n* '''Neil Sutherland''' ([[Andreas Hadjou]]) is known to be the dim-witted, gentle and gullible \"[[nice guy]]\" member of the group. He often fails to accept that he is responsible for the bad situations he causes, and fails to pick up on sarcasm, often taking comments seriously and consistently believes Jay's compulsive and blatant lies. Neil's simpler mind means he is often happy and positive and he displays less of the selfishness and obsession with sex as the others. He tends to be the most sexually experienced member of the group.\n\n===Recurring characters===\n* '''Carli D'Amato''' ([[Emily Head]]) is Simon's main love interest. She demonstrates a good deal of influence over her peers, including school bullies. She and Simon have been friends since the age of eight, and this likely accounts for Simon being able to approach a girl in such a different social circle. Generally, Carli is selfish and has little romantic interest in Simon but uses his obvious [[infatuation]] to her own advantage.\n* '''Charlotte Hinchcliffe''' ([[Emily Atack]]) is the most attractive and popular girl in the school. She is very confident and a year above the four boys. Unlike most of the popular girls, Charlotte is kind-hearted and genuinely likes Will and most other classmates. She mentions to Will that she has had \"eleven lovers already\", and is held in very high regard by the boys.\n* '''Mr Gilbert''' ([[Greg Davies]]) is an archetypal [[comprehensive school]] [[teacher]]. [[Misanthropy|Misanthropic]] and authoritarian, he has no interest in his work and treats his pupils with hatred. As head of sixth form, he answers to the headmaster of the school. Physically, he is very tall and stocky, which everyone finds intimidating, being described by Will as a \"lunatic giant\". He has a quick-wit and [[sardonicism]], which he uses to convey his disillusionment of his job and the children for whose care he is responsible. Will attempts to endear himself often with Mr Gilbert and is rebuffed. Mr Gilbert evidently wants a quiet life and rather than ensuring fairness between the children he merely ignores situations and moves on, often leaving things unresolved. He has an intense dislike for Will and Jay.\n* '''Mark Donovan''' ([[Henry Lloyd-Hughes]]) is Will's nemesis, often picking on him to fulfill his role as the [[Bullying|school bully]]. Like many bullies, Donovan displays the persona of being friendly and patient in front of parents or teachers. However, he occasionally reveals his sensitive side to Will, though threatens him with death if he speaks of it.\n* '''Polly McKenzie''' ([[Belinda Stewart-Wilson]]) is Will's Mum. She is very attractive and a principal object of Will's friends' desires, who often crudely mention how they would like to see her sexually. Neil has often asked Will if he can ask her out, with Will always saying no.\n* '''Pamela Cooper''' ([[Robin Weaver]]) is Simon's Mum.\n* '''Alan Cooper''' ([[Martin Trenaman]]) is Simon's loving and protective Dad, though he often embarrasses him when talking about his sexual adventures with his mother.\n* '''Terry Cartwright''' ([[David Schaal (actor)|David Schaal]]) is Jay's Dad. He regularly [[Child abuse|abuses]] Jay in front of his peers, and does not take him seriously regarding his sexual exploits. He is very similar to Jay in ways as they have a similar sense of sexual 'humour' as Jay gets multiple traits from him.\n* '''Kevin Sutherland''' ([[Alex Macqueen]]) is Neil's Dad. He is divorced and is often portrayed as a [[closeted]] gay man, which he always denies. The boys frequently make fun of Neil because of this.\n* '''Big John''' (John Seaward) is a fellow student. John is one of the new kids who start school on the same day as Will. He is often referred to as one of the freaks and is often seen as a social outcast whom the boys try to avoid.\n* '''Tara Brown''' ([[Hannah Tointon]]) is Simon's girlfriend for half of Series 3.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of The Inbetweeners episodes}}\n\nEpisodes of the first, second and third series can be viewed in Japan, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Australia, New Zealand, and the USA through [[Netflix]].

From left to right: [[Joe Thomas (actor)|Joe Thomas]], [[Simon Bird]], [[James Buckley (actor)|James Buckley]] and [[Blake Harrison]]]]\n\n===Main cast===\nThe four main characters are seen in every episode as well as the 2011 and 2014 films. They consist of:\n* '''[[Will McKenzie]]''' ([[Simon Bird]]) is the programme's [[Protagonist|central character]], with his voiceover introducing and concluding each episode. In the first episode, he has been transferred from a [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|private school]], following his parents' [[divorce]], to Rudge Park Comprehensive, where he eventually befriends the others. He is an unconventional hero \u2013 although he is generally the most intelligent and logical of the group, he is prone to making bad choices and his [[sarcasm]] occasionally leads to him making offensive and shocking statements. Will is diligent, mild-mannered and eager to get into a good university. However, he is shown to be romantically awkward, and [[Pessimism|pessimistic]] about his chances, due to his awareness of his lack of any kind of good looks or [[Social graces|social grace]].\n* '''Simon Cooper''' ([[Joe Thomas (actor)|Joe Thomas]]) is the most [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynical]] and hot-headed of the group, being prone to bouts of hysterical swearing at the slightest provocation \u2013 such as gentle goading, family rules, or even well-meaning advice \u2013 from his family or peers. However, he is also shown in several scenes to be the most trustworthy of the group, and he maintains a closer relationship with Will than any of the others. Simon considers himself to be the most romantic of the boys, his [[On-again, off-again relationship|on-off relationship]] with Carli propelling many of the plots.\n* '''Jay Cartwright''' ([[James Buckley (actor)|James Buckley]]) is the most immature and arrogant of the boys. He is also the most vulgar and harbours a generally [[Misogyny|misogynistic]] outlook. He is obsessed with sex, with almost all his comments being about the subject. He falsely claims to be the most sexually experienced of the group. He frequently tells wild and fictitious stories about his experiences (sexual or otherwise), and hands out highly ridiculous advice (such as claiming that inserting the [[testicles]] into the vagina during sex is something \"some girls like and some don't\"), which demonstrates that in reality he has very little understanding of the subject discussed, also substituting crude nicknames for the vagina. In fact, he is actually the least sexually experienced of the group, frequently relying on [[pornography]] to attain gratification, as he finds it difficult to engage with girls. In addition to his sexual stories, Jay compulsively lies about just about anything to make himself seem interesting, no matter how unbelievable.\n* '''Neil Sutherland''' ([[Blake Harrison]]) is known to be the dim-witted, gentle and gullible \"[[nice guy]]\" member of the group. He often fails to accept that he is responsible for the bad situations he causes, and fails to pick up on sarcasm, often taking comments seriously and consistently believes Jay's compulsive and blatant lies. Neil's simpler mind means he is often happy and positive and he displays less of the selfishness and obsession with sex as the others. He tends to be the most sexually experienced member of the group.\n\n===Recurring characters===\n* '''Carli D'Amato''' ([[Emily Head]]) is Simon's main love interest. She demonstrates a good deal of influence over her peers, including school bullies. She and Simon have been friends since the age of eight, and this likely accounts for Simon being able to approach a girl in such a different social circle. Generally, Carli is selfish and has little romantic interest in Simon but uses his obvious [[infatuation]] to her own advantage.\n* '''Charlotte Hinchcliffe''' ([[Emily Atack]]) is the most attractive and popular girl in the school. She is very confident and a year above the four boys. Unlike most of the popular girls, Charlotte is kind-hearted and genuinely likes Will and most other classmates. She mentions to Will that she has had \"eleven lovers already\", and is held in very high regard by the boys.\n* '''Mr Gilbert''' ([[Greg Davies]]) is an archetypal [[comprehensive school]] [[teacher]]. [[Misanthropy|Misanthropic]] and authoritarian, he has no interest in his work and treats his pupils with hatred. As head of sixth form, he answers to the headmaster of the school. Physically, he is very tall and stocky, which everyone finds intimidating, being described by Will as a \"lunatic giant\". He has a quick-wit and [[sardonicism]], which he uses to convey his disillusionment of his job and the children for whose care he is responsible. Will attempts to endear himself often with Mr Gilbert and is rebuffed. Mr Gilbert evidently wants a quiet life and rather than ensuring fairness between the children he merely ignores situations and moves on, often leaving things unresolved. He has an intense dislike for Will and Jay.\n* '''Mark Donovan''' ([[Henry Lloyd-Hughes]]) is Will's nemesis, often picking on him to fulfill his role as the [[Bullying|school bully]]. Like many bullies, Donovan displays the persona of being friendly and patient in front of parents or teachers. However, he occasionally reveals his sensitive side to Will, though threatens him with death if he speaks of it.\n* '''Polly McKenzie''' ([[Belinda Stewart-Wilson]]) is Will's Mum. She is very attractive and a principal object of Will's friends' desires, who often crudely mention how they would like to see her sexually. Neil has often asked Will if he can ask her out, with Will always saying no.\n* '''Pamela Cooper''' ([[Robin Weaver]]) is Simon's Mum.\n* '''Alan Cooper''' ([[Martin Trenaman]]) is Simon's loving and protective Dad, though he often embarrasses him when talking about his sexual adventures with his mother.\n* '''Terry Cartwright''' ([[David Schaal (actor)|David Schaal]]) is Jay's Dad. He regularly [[Child abuse|abuses]] Jay in front of his peers, and does not take him seriously regarding his sexual exploits. He is very similar to Jay in ways as they have a similar sense of sexual 'humour' as Jay gets multiple traits from him.\n* '''Kevin Sutherland''' ([[Alex Macqueen]]) is Neil's Dad. He is divorced and is often portrayed as a [[closeted]] gay man, which he always denies. The boys frequently make fun of Neil because of this.\n* '''Big John''' (John Seaward) is a fellow student. John is one of the new kids who start school on the same day as Will. He is often referred to as one of the freaks and is often seen as a social outcast whom the boys try to avoid.\n* '''Tara Brown''' ([[Hannah Tointon]]) is Simon's girlfriend for half of Series 3.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of The Inbetweeners episodes}}\n\nEpisodes of the first, second and third series can be viewed in Japan, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Australia, New Zealand, and the USA through [[Netflix]].

Binford]] for passing 2 cars under caution with less than 40 laps to go as well as blocking eventual winner [[Tom Sneva]] from getting by [[Al Unser|his father]] with less than 20 laps to go. The penalty dropped him from an original finish of 9th, to 10th. Despite being lauded for his performance as a rookie, Unser Jr. narrowly lost the rookie of the year award to [[Teo Fabi]].\n\nUnser continued racing on the [[American Championship Car Racing|CART circuit]], becoming one of the series' rising stars. He finished second in the CART championship point standings in [[1985 IndyCar season|1985]], losing to [[Al Unser|his father]] by just one point. He began competing in the [[International Race of Champions|IROC]] championship in 1986, winning that championship with two victories in four races. At the age of 24, Unser was the youngest IROC champion ever. Unser won the 1988 and 1986 IROC championships. Unser won the [[24 Hours of Daytona]], also at age 24 for the first time in 1986 and again in 1987.\n\nUnser continued to improve on the CART circuit, finishing fourth in the points standings in [[1986 IndyCar season|1986]], third in [[1987 IndyCar season|1987]], second in [[1988 IndyCar season|1988]] and finally winning the series for the first time in [[1990 IndyCar season|1990]]. In [[1989 Indianapolis 500|1989]], Unser was on the verge of winning his first Indianapolis 500, but while battling with [[Emerson Fittipaldi]] for the lead, the two touched wheels and Unser spun out, hitting the wall and ending his chances. This race is remembered for a remarkable show of sportsmanship, as Little Al climbed out of his wrecked racecar and gave Fittipaldi the \"thumbs up\" as he drove by Unser under caution. Unser would have [[1992 Indianapolis 500|his day at Indy in 1992]], however, defeating [[Scott Goodyear]] by 0.043 of a second, the closest finish in Indianapolis 500 history.\n\nDuring the off-season he drove in the [[1993 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|1993]] [[Daytona 500]] for [[Hendrick Motorsports]] finishing 36th in what would be his only [[NASCAR]] start. He ran well in [[1993 Daytona 500|the race]], running with the lead pack all day, until a late race crash with [[Kyle Petty]] and [[Bobby Hillin Jr.]] During an interview with [[Mike Joy]] after the accident, Joy asked him if he would be back. Unser said that he wanted to come back, but it would never happen. Unser also tested a [[Williams F1]] car but never competed in the series.\n\n===Penske years===\n[[Image:PenskePC23.jpg|thumb|right|[[Penske PC-23]] driven by Unser in 1994]]\n\nIn [[1994 IndyCar season|1994]], Unser again won [[1994 Indianapolis 500|at Indy]], this time with [[Penske Racing]]. His teammates were [[Emerson Fittipaldi]], the man whom he battled with five years before, and [[Paul Tracy]]. Unser turned in a dominant season-long performance, winning eight of 16 races on his way to his second CART championship, as well as being named [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s [[Wide World of Sports (U.S. TV series)|Wide World of Sports]] Athlete of the Year that year. In [[1995 IndyCar season|1995]] Unser, along with teammate Emerson Fittipaldi, failed to qualify at [[1995 Indianapolis 500|Indianapolis]], and he would later point to this as the trigger event for his descent into alcoholism and the breakup of his marriage. He would finish second to [[Jacques Villeneuve]] in CART championship points in 1995. He finished fourth in [[1996 IndyCar season|1996]], despite having a chance of winning the championship until the end of the season.\n\nUnser ranked 13th in [[1997 CART season|1997]], 11th in [[1998 CART season|1998]] and 21st in [[1999 CART Championship Series season|1999]], not helped by the fact that he had to sit out two races after breaking his leg in the season-opener at [[GAINSCO Auto Insurance Indy 300|Miami]] in a first-lap accident. Little Al's decline in performance coincided with the Penske team's struggles with the Penske chassis, and his teammates suffered similar results during this time.\n\nTeam Penske began abandoning the maligned in-house Penske chassis for customer Lola chassis during the 1999 season. Unser would eventually leave CART to join the budding [[Indy Racing League]] for the [[2000 in IRL|2000 campaign]].\n\nUnser won a total of 31 races during his 17 seasons in CART. His career win total including IRL stands at 34, which is currently the sixth-most all time in American open wheel racing (as of 2013). As a two-time Indy 500 and two-time overall points champion, Unser enjoyed a decorated career as one of the most dynamic and successful drivers in American auto racing.(9)\n\n===Indy Racing League===\nUnser would go on to win a total of three races in his IRL career, but after [[broken pelvis|breaking his pelvis]] in an [[all-terrain vehicle]] accident in October [[2003 IndyCar Series season|2003]], Unser had difficulty securing a ride for the [[2004 IndyCar Series season|2004 season]]. He finally signed with [[Patrick Racing]] three races into the season, but after a 22nd-place finish in [[Richmond International Raceway|Richmond]], Unser finally announced his retirement from racing on June 30, 2004. Unser continued to remain involved in racing, however, outside of a driving capacity.  He served as an adviser for Patrick Racing and worked as a mentor for his son, [[Alfred Unser]], who is currently working his way through the lower ranks in open-wheel racing.\n\n===Post-retirement racing and personal issues===\n[[Image:AlUnserJrPractice2007Indy500.jpg|thumb|right|Unser practicing for the [[2007 Indianapolis 500]]]]\n[[Image:AlUnserJrMay2007Cropped.jpg|thumb|right|Unser before the 2007 Indianapolis 500]]\n\nIn [[2006 IndyCar Series season|2006]] Unser announced that he would come back to racing again and he would run the [[2006 Indianapolis 500]], teamed with fellow former winner [[Buddy Lazier]] for [[Dreyer & Reinbold Racing]]. This came just days after [[Michael Andretti]] also came out of retirement to run the 500. Unser qualified 27th in the 33-car field, and consistently ran in the upper half until a crash ended his day.\n\nIn late August, Unser took part in an [[A1 Grand Prix]] test session at [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]].\n\nOn 25 January 2007, Unser was arrested and charged with [[driving under the influence]], misdemeanor hit and run, failure to render aid in an accident and failure to report an accident near [[Henderson, Nevada]], USA.\n\nOn 2 May 2007, it was announced that Unser would drive a car for racing legend [[A. J. Foyt]] in the [[2007 Indianapolis 500]], carrying the No. 50 on his car in recognition of A.J.'s 50 years at [[Indianapolis 500|the storied race]]. Unser qualified in the 25th starting position after being bumped from the lineup on the second day of qualifying.\n\nOn 18 May 2007, Unser spoke publicly for the first time about his battle with [[alcoholism]] when he joined forces with ''[[LIVE outside the Bottle]]'',<ref>[http://www.LiveOutsideTheBottle.com LiveOutsideTheBottle.com] {{Webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20071007221522/http://www.liveoutsidethebottle.com/ |date=2007-10-07 }}, Retrieved 2011-09-29</ref> a national educational campaign to help the public understand the need for addressing and treating alcoholism.\n\nDuring [[2009 Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach|the race weekend]] of the [[2009 Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach]], Unser confirmed that his [[American Championship Car Racing|IndyCar career]] was in fact over.<ref>Cain, Holly.

Charges stemmed from an incident where Unser reportedly drag raced his [[Chevrolet Suburban]] SUV at speeds of over 100&nbsp;mph. He was placed on indefinite suspension from his role with IndyCar.<ref>Contreras, Russell.

Unser dominated the race, but co-driver Ivan Bellarosa crashed the car out.\n\nIn 2014, once again at Long Beach he participated in the Pro/Celebrity race, finishing fifth, 6.115 seconds behind winner Brett Davern and four other celebrities, winning the Pro Division (30-second disadvantage assessed to professionals) for his ninth Long Beach victory overall, extending the \"King of the Beach\" nickname.  Later that year, Unser raced again at the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]], participating in the Indy Legends Charity Pro/Am race, during the Sportscar Vintage Racing Association's Brickyard Vintage Racing Invitational event. This two-driver race included an Indianapolis 500 veteran in each car.  Unser won the race, along with Peter Klutt, driving Klutt's 1969 [[Chevrolet Corvette (C3)|Chevrolet Corvette]].  In so doing, Unser became the second driver to win on both the oval and road course at the Speedway.\n\nIn 2015, Unser participated in several Goodguys AutoCross competitions while racing Speedway Motors' 1970 Camaro.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.speedwaymotors.com/featured/gcomp|title=G-Comp Team Speedway|last=|first=|date=|website=www.speedwaymotors.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref> He also raced in the [[Sports Car Club of America]] [[American Autocross|Solo]] National Championship, placing second in his class, and is entered again at Thunderhill for the 25 Hours.  Because of his age (over 50), Unser is eligible to drop down a level from professional class to an \"amateur\" class (Silver level) under the FIA driver rankings used for sportscar races, although the National Auto Sport Association does not use such ratings.\n\nOn May 20, 2019, just days before the [[2019 Indianapolis 500]], Unser Jr. was charged for DUI for a fourth time.<ref>Al Unser Jr., 2-time Indy 500 winner arrested on OWI count in Indiana, IndyStar.com, Retrieved from https://www.indystar.com/story/news/crime/2019/05/20/al-unser-jr-arrested-owi-dui-avon-indiana-indy-500/3738991002/</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nUnser married Shelley; the couple later divorced.<ref>{{cite web |title=Cody Unser: Never Say Never Again Essay |url=http://www.deepthrottle.com/Essays/cody_unser.shtml |publisher=Deep Throttle}}</ref> He has four children, Al Unser III, Cody Unser, Shannon Unser, and Joe Unser.<ref name=\"50PlusPrime\">{{Cite episode |title=50 Plus Prime |episode-link= |url= |access-date= |series=50 Plus Prime |series-link= |first= |last= |network= |station=[[WGBA]] |date=April 14, 2019 |season= |series-no= |number= |minutes= |time=2:56 |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}</ref> Cody lost the use of her legs on February 5, 1999 when she was 12 years old.<ref name=\"50PlusPrime\" /> She, along with her mother Shelley, founded the organization \"Cody Unser First Step Foundation\" at age 13 and she writes about the cause on ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]''.<ref name=\"CodyUnserUSNewsWorldReport\">{{cite news |title=Cody Unser / Contributor |url=https://www.usnews.com/topics/author/cody-unser |accessdate=April 14, 2019 |work=[[U.S. News & World Report]]}}</ref> Shelley Unser died on Wednesday, August 15, 2018.\n\n==Motorsports career results==\n\n===American Open Wheel racing results===\n([[Template:American Open Wheel driver results legend|key]]) (Races in '''bold''' indicate pole position)\n\n====PPG Indycar Series====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%\"\n|-\n!colspan=45| [[Champ Car|CART]] results\n|-\n!

He is the son of [[Al Unser]] and the nephew of [[Bobby Unser]], both [[Indianapolis 500]] winners themselves. The Unser family has won the Indy 500 a record nine times.\n\n===Early career===\nBy the age of 11, Al Junior was racing [[sprint car]]s. After high school, he was already in the [[World of Outlaws]] series of sprint car racing. He soon moved into road racing, winning the [[Super Vee]] title in 1981 and the [[Can-Am]] title in 1982.\n\n===Rising CART star===\nIn [[1982 IndyCar season|1982]], Unser made his debut on the [[Champ Car|CART]] circuit. He suffered personal tragedy when his sister Debbie was killed in a dune buggy accident, but this did not deter Unser; and [[1983 IndyCar season|a year later]], he competed in [[1983 Indianapolis 500|his first Indianapolis 500]], finishing 9th. However, hours after the race ended, Unser Jr. was issued a 2-lap penalty by chief steward [[Thomas W. Binford]] for passing 2 cars under caution with less than 40 laps to go as well as blocking eventual winner [[Tom Sneva]] from getting by [[Al Unser|his father]] with less than 20 laps to go. The penalty dropped him from an original finish of 9th, to 10th. Despite being lauded for his performance as a rookie, Unser Jr. narrowly lost the rookie of the year award to [[Teo Fabi]].\n\nUnser continued racing on the [[American Championship Car Racing|CART circuit]], becoming one of the series' rising stars. He finished second in the CART championship point standings in [[1985 IndyCar season|1985]], losing to [[Al Unser|his father]] by just one point. He began competing in the [[International Race of Champions|IROC]] championship in 1986, winning that championship with two victories in four races. At the age of 24, Unser was the youngest IROC champion ever. Unser won the 1988 and 1986 IROC championships. Unser won the [[24 Hours of Daytona]], also at age 24 for the first time in 1986 and again in 1987.\n\nUnser continued to improve on the CART circuit, finishing fourth in the points standings in [[1986 IndyCar season|1986]], third in [[1987 IndyCar season|1987]], second in [[1988 IndyCar season|1988]] and finally winning the series for the first time in [[1990 IndyCar season|1990]]. In [[1989 Indianapolis 500|1989]], Unser was on the verge of winning his first Indianapolis 500, but while battling with [[Emerson Fittipaldi]] for the lead, the two touched wheels and Unser spun out, hitting the wall and ending his chances. This race is remembered for a remarkable show of sportsmanship, as Little Al climbed out of his wrecked racecar and gave Fittipaldi the \"thumbs up\" as he drove by Unser under caution. Unser would have [[1992 Indianapolis 500|his day at Indy in 1992]], however, defeating [[Scott Goodyear]] by 0.043 of a second, the closest finish in Indianapolis 500 history.\n\nDuring the off-season he drove in the [[1993 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|1993]] [[Daytona 500]] for [[Hendrick Motorsports]] finishing 36th in what would be his only [[NASCAR]] start. He ran well in [[1993 Daytona 500|the race]], running with the lead pack all day, until a late race crash with [[Kyle Petty]] and [[Bobby Hillin Jr.]] During an interview with [[Mike Joy]] after the accident, Joy asked him if he would be back. Unser said that he wanted to come back, but it would never happen. Unser also tested a [[Williams F1]] car but never competed in the series.\n\n===Penske years===\n[[Image:PenskePC23.jpg|thumb|right|[[Penske PC-23]] driven by Unser in 1994]]\n\nIn [[1994 IndyCar season|1994]], Unser again won [[1994 Indianapolis 500|at Indy]], this time with [[Penske Racing]]. His teammates were [[Emerson Fittipaldi]], the man whom he battled with five years before, and [[Paul Tracy]]. Unser turned in a dominant season-long performance, winning eight of 16 races on his way to his second CART championship, as well as being named [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s [[Wide World of Sports (U.S. TV series)|Wide World of Sports]] Athlete of the Year that year. In [[1995 IndyCar season|1995]] Unser, along with teammate Emerson Fittipaldi, failed to qualify at [[1995 Indianapolis 500|Indianapolis]], and he would later point to this as the trigger event for his descent into alcoholism and the breakup of his marriage. He would finish second to [[Jacques Villeneuve]] in CART championship points in 1995. He finished fourth in [[1996 IndyCar season|1996]], despite having a chance of winning the championship until the end of the season.\n\nUnser ranked 13th in [[1997 CART season|1997]], 11th in [[1998 CART season|1998]] and 21st in [[1999 CART Championship Series season|1999]], not helped by the fact that he had to sit out two races after breaking his leg in the season-opener at [[GAINSCO Auto Insurance Indy 300|Miami]] in a first-lap accident. Little Al's decline in performance coincided with the Penske team's struggles with the Penske chassis, and his teammates suffered similar results during this time.\n\nTeam Penske began abandoning the maligned in-house Penske chassis for customer Lola chassis during the 1999 season. Unser would eventually leave CART to join the budding [[Indy Racing League]] for the [[2000 in IRL|2000 campaign]].\n\nUnser won a total of 31 races during his 17 seasons in CART. His career win total including IRL stands at 34, which is currently the sixth-most all time in American open wheel racing (as of 2013). As a two-time Indy 500 and two-time overall points champion, Unser enjoyed a decorated career as one of the most dynamic and successful drivers in American auto racing.(9)\n\n===Indy Racing League===\nUnser would go on to win a total of three races in his IRL career, but after [[broken pelvis|breaking his pelvis]] in an [[all-terrain vehicle]] accident in October [[2003 IndyCar Series season|2003]], Unser had difficulty securing a ride for the [[2004 IndyCar Series season|2004 season]]. He finally signed with [[Patrick Racing]] three races into the season, but after a 22nd-place finish in [[Richmond International Raceway|Richmond]], Unser finally announced his retirement from racing on June 30, 2004. Unser continued to remain involved in racing, however, outside of a driving capacity.  He served as an adviser for Patrick Racing and worked as a mentor for his son, [[Alfred Unser]], who is currently working his way through the lower ranks in open-wheel racing.\n\n===Post-retirement racing and personal issues===\n[[Image:AlUnserJrPractice2007Indy500.jpg|thumb|right|Unser practicing for the [[2007 Indianapolis 500]]]]\n[[Image:AlUnserJrMay2007Cropped.jpg|thumb|right|Unser before the 2007 Indianapolis 500]]\n\nIn [[2006 IndyCar Series season|2006]] Unser announced that he would come back to racing again and he would run the [[2006 Indianapolis 500]], teamed with fellow former winner [[Buddy Lazier]] for [[Dreyer & Reinbold Racing]]. This came just days after [[Michael Andretti]] also came out of retirement to run the 500. Unser qualified 27th in the 33-car field, and consistently ran in the upper half until a crash ended his day.\n\nIn late August, Unser took part in an [[A1 Grand Prix]] test session at [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]].\n\nOn 25 January 2007, Unser was arrested and charged with [[driving under the influence]], misdemeanor hit and run, failure to render aid in an accident and failure to report an accident near [[Henderson, Nevada]], USA.\n\nOn 2 May 2007, it was announced that Unser would drive a car for racing legend [[A. J. Foyt]] in the [[2007 Indianapolis 500]], carrying the No. 50 on his car in recognition of A.J.'s 50 years at [[Indianapolis 500|the storied race]]. Unser qualified in the 25th starting position after being bumped from the lineup on the second day of qualifying.\n\nOn 18 May 2007, Unser spoke publicly for the first time about his battle with [[alcoholism]] when he joined forces with ''[[LIVE outside the Bottle]]'',<ref>[http://www.LiveOutsideTheBottle.com LiveOutsideTheBottle.com] {{Webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20071007221522/http://www.liveoutsidethebottle.com/ |date=2007-10-07 }}, Retrieved 2011-09-29</ref> a national educational campaign to help the public understand the need for addressing and treating alcoholism.\n\nDuring [[2009 Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach|the race weekend]] of the [[2009 Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach]], Unser confirmed that his [[American Championship Car Racing|IndyCar career]] was in fact over.<ref>Cain, Holly.

Charges stemmed from an incident where Unser reportedly drag raced his [[Chevrolet Suburban]] SUV at speeds of over 100&nbsp;mph. He was placed on indefinite suspension from his role with IndyCar.<ref>Contreras, Russell. [https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jbi-hqFsVnZpgIWS2jVYH_PYRDCg?docId=0fb451a5f90147069d1fd4da508e6b8e Indy 500 winner Al Unser Jr. arrested for DWI], ''Associated Press'', September 29, 2011, Retrieved 2011-09-29</ref>\n\nIn 2013, Unser entered a sportscar race at [[Thunderhill Raceway Park]], the legendary 25 Hours of Thunderhill, racing with his son Al III as teammates.  Unser dominated the race, but co-driver Ivan Bellarosa crashed the car out.\n\nIn 2014, once again at Long Beach he participated in the Pro/Celebrity race, finishing fifth, 6.115 seconds behind winner Brett Davern and four other celebrities, winning the Pro Division (30-second disadvantage assessed to professionals) for his ninth Long Beach victory overall, extending the \"King of the Beach\" nickname.  Later that year, Unser raced again at the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]], participating in the Indy Legends Charity Pro/Am race, during the Sportscar Vintage Racing Association's Brickyard Vintage Racing Invitational event. This two-driver race included an Indianapolis 500 veteran in each car.  Unser won the race, along with Peter Klutt, driving Klutt's 1969 [[Chevrolet Corvette (C3)|Chevrolet Corvette]].  In so doing, Unser became the second driver to win on both the oval and road course at the Speedway.\n\nIn 2015, Unser participated in several Goodguys AutoCross competitions while racing Speedway Motors' 1970 Camaro.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.speedwaymotors.com/featured/gcomp|title=G-Comp Team Speedway|last=|first=|date=|website=www.speedwaymotors.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref> He also raced in the [[Sports Car Club of America]] [[American Autocross|Solo]] National Championship, placing second in his class, and is entered again at Thunderhill for the 25 Hours.  Because of his age (over 50), Unser is eligible to drop down a level from professional class to an \"amateur\" class (Silver level) under the FIA driver rankings used for sportscar races, although the National Auto Sport Association does not use such ratings.\n\nOn May 20, 2019, just days before the [[2019 Indianapolis 500]], Unser Jr. was charged for DUI for a fourth time.<ref>Al Unser Jr., 2-time Indy 500 winner arrested on OWI count in Indiana, IndyStar.com, Retrieved from https://www.indystar.com/story/news/crime/2019/05/20/al-unser-jr-arrested-owi-dui-avon-indiana-indy-500/3738991002/</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nUnser married Shelley; the couple later divorced.<ref>{{cite web |title=Cody Unser: Never Say Never Again Essay |url=http://www.deepthrottle.com/Essays/cody_unser.shtml |publisher=Deep Throttle}}</ref> He has four children, Al Unser III, Cody Unser, Shannon Unser, and Joe Unser.<ref name=\"50PlusPrime\">{{Cite episode |title=50 Plus Prime |episode-link= |url= |access-date= |series=50 Plus Prime |series-link= |first= |last= |network= |station=[[WGBA]] |date=April 14, 2019 |season= |series-no= |number= |minutes= |time=2:56 |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}</ref> Cody lost the use of her legs on February 5, 1999 when she was 12 years old.<ref name=\"50PlusPrime\" /> She, along with her mother Shelley, founded the organization \"Cody Unser First Step Foundation\" at age 13 and she writes about the cause on ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]''.<ref name=\"CodyUnserUSNewsWorldReport\">{{cite news |title=Cody Unser / Contributor |url=https://www.usnews.com/topics/author/cody-unser |accessdate=April 14, 2019 |work=[[U.S. News & World Report]]}}</ref> Shelley Unser died on Wednesday, August 15, 2018.\n\n==Motorsports career results==\n\n===American Open Wheel racing results===\n([[Template:American Open Wheel driver results legend|key]]) (Races in '''bold''' indicate pole position)\n\n====PPG Indycar Series====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%\"\n|-\n!colspan=45| [[Champ Car|CART]] results\n|-\n!
