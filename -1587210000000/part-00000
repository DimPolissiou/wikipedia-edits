Knaphus]], located on [[Temple Square]] in Salt Lake City, Utah]]\n\nThe '''Mormon handcart pioneers''' were participants in the [[human migration|migration]] of members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) to [[Salt Lake City, Utah|Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]], who used [[Cart|handcarts]] to transport their belongings.<ref name=\"Roberts\">{{citation |url= https://www.americanheritage.com/awful-march-saints |first= David |last= Roberts |title= The Awful March of the Saints |journal= American Heritage |date= Fall 2008}}</ref> The Mormon handcart movement began in 1856 and continued until 1860.\n\nMotivated to join their fellow church members in Utah, but lacking funds for full teams of [[ox|oxen]] or [[horse]]s, nearly 3,000 [[Mormon pioneers]] from [[England]], [[Wales]], [[Scotland]] and [[Scandinavia]] made the journey from [[Iowa]] or [[Nebraska]] to Utah in ten handcart companies. The trek was disastrous for two of the companies, which started their journey dangerously late and were caught by heavy snow and severe temperatures in central [[Wyoming]]. Despite a dramatic rescue effort, more than 210 of the 980 pioneers in these two companies died along the way. John Chislett, a survivor, wrote, \"Many a father pulled his cart, with his little children on it, until the day preceding his death.\"<ref>Hafen and Hafen (1981), p. 102.</ref>\n\nAlthough fewer than 10 percent of the 1846\u201368 [[Latter-day Saint]] emigrants made the journey west using handcarts, the handcart pioneers have become an important symbol in LDS culture, representing the faithfulness and sacrifice of the pioneer generation. They continue to be recognized and honored in events such as [[Pioneer Day (Utah)|Pioneer Day]], church pageants, and similar commemorations.\n\n==Background to the migration==\n{{details|Mormon pioneers}}\nThe [[Latter Day Saint movement|Latter Day Saints]] were first organized in 1830. Early members of the church often encountered hostility, primarily due to their practice of withdrawing from secular society and gathering in locales to practice their distinct religious beliefs. Their neighbors felt threatened by the church's rapid growth in numbers, its tendency to vote as a [[voting bloc|bloc]] and acquire political power, its claims of divine favor, and, later, the practice of [[plural marriage|polygamy]].<ref>O'Dea (1957), pp. 41\u201349, 72\u201375.</ref> Violence directed against the church and its members caused the body of the church to move from [[Ohio]] to [[Missouri]], then to [[Illinois]]. Despite the frequent moves, church members were unable to escape opposition, which culminated in the [[Missouri Executive Order 44|extermination order]] against all Mormons living in the state by Missouri Governor [[Lilburn Boggs]] in 1838 and the [[Death of Joseph Smith|death]] of their leader [[Joseph Smith]] in 1844. [[Brigham Young]] said that he had received divine direction to organize the church members and head beyond the western frontier of the United States.<ref>O'Dea (1957), pp. 1\u201385</ref><ref>Allen and Leonard (1976), pp. 103\u2013256.</ref>\n\n==Need for handcart companies==\nSoon after the first Mormon pioneers reached Utah in 1847, the church began encouraging its converts in the [[British Isles]] and elsewhere in Europe to [[Immigration to the United States|emigrate]] to Utah. From 1849 to 1855, about 16,000 European [[Latter-day Saints]] traveled to the United States by ship, through the eastern states by rail, and to Utah by ox and wagon. Although most of these emigrants paid their own expenses, the church established the [[Perpetual Emigration Fund]] to provide financial assistance for poor emigrants to trek west, which they would repay as they were able. Contributions to expand the fund were encouraged.<ref>Hafen and Hafen (1981), pp. 22\u201327.</ref>\n\nWhen contributions and loan repayments dropped off in 1855 after a poor harvest in Utah, Young decided to begin using handcarts because the church members who remained in Europe were mostly poor. Young also believed it would speed the journey.<ref>Hafen and Hafen (1981), pp. 28\u201331.</ref>\n\nYoung proposed the plan in a letter to [[Franklin D. Richards (Mormon apostle)|Franklin D. Richards]], [[Mission president|president]] of the European [[Mission (LDS Church)|Mission]], in September 1855. Young's letter was published in the ''[[Millennial Star]]'', the church's England-based periodical, on December 22, 1855, along with an editorial by Richards endorsing the project. The cost of the migration was expected to be reduced by one-third. The response was overwhelming \u2013 in 1856 the Perpetual Emigration Fund supported the travel of 2,012 European emigrants, compared with 1,161 the year before.<ref>Hafen and Hafen (1981), pp. 29\u201334, 46.</ref>\n\n==Outfitting==\nEmigrants departed from an English port (generally [[Liverpool]]) and travelled by ship to [[New York City|New York]] or [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], then by railroad to [[Iowa City, Iowa]], the western terminus of the rail line, where they would be outfitted with handcarts and other supplies.<ref>Hafen and Hafen (1981), pp. 40, 44, 91, 153, 157, 180.</ref>\n[[File:PlattCrossing.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Reenactment: Pioneers crossing the [[Platte River]], from PBS documentary ''Sweetwater Rescue'' ]]\n\nBuilt to Young's design, the handcarts resembled a large [[wheelbarrow]], with two wheels {{convert|5|ft|m|abbr=off|spell=in}} in diameter and a single axle {{convert|4+1/2|ft|m|spell=in}} wide, and weighing {{convert|60|lb|kg}}. Running along each side of the bed were seven-foot (2.1 m) pull shafts ending with a three-foot (0.9&nbsp;m) crossbar at the front. The crossbar allowed the carts to be pushed or pulled.

After crossing the [[Missouri River]], they paused for a few days at a [[Winter Quarters, Nebraska|Mormon outpost]] in [[Florence, Nebraska]] (now part of [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]]), for repairs, before beginning the remaining {{convert|1,030|mi|km|adj=on}} journey along the [[Mormon Trail]] to Salt Lake City.<ref>Kimball (1979).</ref>\n\nInitial problems with the carts occurred because the wood used to construct them was said to have been \"green timber\", with many more breakdowns than anticipated. When the first handcart company reached Winter Quarters, Edmund Ellsworth had a member of the company \"tin\" the wooden axles and also installed \"thick hoop iron skeins\" which enabled the handcart axles to turn more easily and resist breakage much better.<ref>{{cite web|title=Biography of Edmund Lovell Ellsworth|url=http://www.public.asu.edu/~ellswork/EdmundsBiography.htm|website=Arizona State University|accessdate=June 16, 2014}}</ref> This feature became a standard part of handcarts in following years, including frequent greasing to keep the wheels lubricated. With no method of communicating back up the trail, however, this needed set of fixes did not reach the fourth and fifth companies in time.\n\nThe companies made good time, and their trips were largely uneventful. The emigrant companies included many children and elderly individuals, and pushing and pulling handcarts was difficult work. Journals and recollections describe periods of illness and hunger. Like other companies traveling on the [[Emigrant Trail]], deaths occurred along the way. Hafen and Hafen's ''Handcarts to Zion'' lists 13 deaths from the first company, seven from the second, and fewer than seven from the third. Journal entries reflect the optimism of the handcart pioneers, even amid their hardships:\n\n{{quote|People made fun of us as we walked, pulling our handcarts, but the weather was fine and the roads were excellent and although I was sick and we were very tired at night, still we thought it was a glorious way to go to [[Zion (Mormonism)|Zion]].<ref>Emigrant Priscilla M.

The ship ''Thornton'', carrying the emigrants who became the Willie Company, did not leave England until May 4. The leader of the Latter-day Saints on the ''Thornton'' was [[James G. Willie]]. Another eleven days passed before the ''Horizon,'' departed, carrying the emigrants who later formed the Martin Company. The late departures may have been the result of difficulties in procuring ships in response to the unexpected demand, but the results would be tragic.<ref>Hafen and Hafen (1981), p. 91.</ref>\n\nWith slow communications in the era before the transatlantic telegraph, the church's agents in Iowa City were not expecting the additional emigrants and had to make frantic preparations for their arrival. Critical weeks were spent hastily assembling the carts and outfitting the companies. When the companies reached Florence, additional time was lost making repairs to the poorly built carts.<ref>Hafen and Hafen (1981), pp. 92\u201394.</ref> Emigrant John Chislett describes the problems with the carts:<ref>Hafen and Hafen (1981), pp. 99\u2013100.</ref>\n\n{{quote|The axles and boxes being of wood, and being ground out by the dust that found its way there in spite of our efforts to keep it out, together with the extra weight put on the carts, had the effect of breaking the axles at the shoulder. All kinds of expedients were resorted to as remedies for the growing evil, but with variable success. Some wrapped their axles with leather obtained from bootlegs; others with tin, obtained by sacrificing tin-plates, kettles, or buckets from their mess outfit. Besides these inconveniences, there was felt a great lack of a proper lubricator. Of anything suitable for this purpose we had none at all.}}\n\nPrior to the Willie Company departing Florence, the company met to debate the wisdom of such a late departure. Because the emigrants were unfamiliar with the trail and the climate, they deferred to the returning missionaries and church agents. One of the returning missionaries, [[Levi Savage Jr.|Levi Savage]], urged them to spend the winter in Nebraska. He argued that such a late departure with a company consisting of the elderly, women, and young children would lead to suffering, sickness, and even death. All of the other church [[Elder (Mormonism)|elders]] argued that the trip should go forward, expressing optimism that the company would be protected by [[miracle|divine intervention]]. Some members of the company, perhaps as many as 100, decided to spend the winter in Florence or in Iowa, but the majority, about 404 in number (including Savage) continued the journey west. The Willie Company left Florence on August 17 and the Martin Company on August 27. Two ox-wagon trains, led by captains W.B. Hodgett and John A. Hunt, followed the Martin Company.<ref>Hafen and Hafen (1981), pp. 96\u201397.</ref>\n\nNear [[Wood River, Nebraska|Wood River]], [[Nebraska]], a herd of [[American bison|bison]] caused the Willie Company's cattle to [[stampede]], and nearly 30 cattle were lost. Left without enough cattle to pull all of the wagons, each handcart was required to take on an additional {{convert|100|lb|kg}} of flour.<ref>Hafen and Hafen (1981), p. 100.</ref>\n\nIn early September, Franklin D. Richards, returning from Europe where he had served as the church's [[mission president]], passed the emigrant companies. Richards and the 12 returning missionaries who accompanied him, traveling in carriages and light wagons pulled by horses and mules, pressed on to Utah to obtain assistance for the emigrants.<ref>Hafen and Hafen (1981), pp. 97\u201398, 119.</ref><ref>Bartholomew and Arrington (1993), p. 5.</ref> The Loader family and Harrison family were with the Martin Company. Patience Loader Rozsa Archer (at the time of their journey the twenty-nine-year-old Patience Loader) later wrote in her autobiography (c.1887) of the struggle:<blockquote>[T]his was in the month of '''september [1856]''' and our dear father was beginning to get very weak and food was geting Short day by day his strength began to fail him Some days he was not able to pull the cart but had to walk[.]<ref>{{Cite book|last=Petree|first=Sandra Ailey|title=Recollections of Past Days the Autobiography of Patience Loader Rozsa Archer|publisher=Utah State University Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=Logan, Utah|pages=70}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Disaster and rescue===\nIn early October the two companies reached [[Fort Laramie National Historic Site|Fort Laramie]], Wyoming, where they expected to be restocked with provisions, but no provisions were pre-stocked for them. The companies cut back food rations, hoping that their supplies would last until help could be sent from Utah. To lighten their loads, the Martin Company cut the luggage allowance to {{convert|10|lb|kg}} per person, discarding clothing and blankets that soon would be desperately needed.<ref>Hafen and Hafen (1981), pp. 101, 108.</ref><ref>Bartholomew and Arrington (1993), pp. 3\u20134.</ref>\n\n[[File:Man3.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Dramatization of man pulling [[handcart]] through snow]]\nOn October 4, the Richards party reached Salt Lake City and conferred with Brigham Young and other church leaders. The next morning the church was meeting in a [[General Conference (LDS Church)|general conference]], where Young and the other speakers called on church members to provide wagons, [[mule]]s, supplies, and [[teamster]]s for a rescue mission. On the morning of October 7, the first rescue party left Salt Lake City with 16 wagon-loads of food and supplies, pulled by four-mule teams with 27 young men serving as teamsters and rescuers. The party elected George D. Grant as their captain. Throughout October more wagon trains were assembled, and by the end of the month 250 relief wagons were on the road.<ref>Hafen and Hafen (1981), pp. 119\u2013125.</ref><ref>Bartholomew and Arrington (1993), pp. 5\u201311.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the Willie and Martin companies were running out of food and encountering bitterly cold temperatures. On October 19, a blizzard struck the region, halting the two companies and the relief party. The Willie Company was along the [[Sweetwater River (Wyoming)|Sweetwater River]] approaching the [[Continental Divide]]. A scouting party sent ahead by the main rescue party found and greeted the emigrants, gave them a small amount of flour, encouraged them that rescue was near, and then rushed onward to try to locate the Martin Company.<ref>The various sources disagree regarding the identities of the members of first \"express team\" that found the Willie Company. Hafen and Hafen [1960] (1981), quoting emigrant John Chislett, name [[Joseph Angell Young|Joseph Young]] and Stephen Taylor. Jones (1890), a member of the rescue party, names Cyrus Wheelock and Stephen Taylor. Bartholomew and Arrington (1992) name Joseph Young, Abel Garr, and Cyrus Wheelock.</ref> The members of the Willie Company had just reached the end of their flour supplies. They began slaughtering the handful of broken-down cattle that still remained while their death toll mounted. On October 20, Captain Willie and Joseph Elder went ahead by mule through the snow to locate the supply train and inform them of the company's desperate situation. They arrived at the rescue party's campsite near [[South Pass (Wyoming)|South Pass]] that evening, and by the next evening the rescue party reached the Willie Company and provided them with food and assistance. Half of the rescue party remained to assist the Willie Company while the other half pressed forward to assist the Martin Company. The difficulties of the Willie Company were not yet over. On October 23, the second day after the main rescue party had arrived, the Willie Company faced the most difficult section of the trail\u2014the ascent up Rocky Ridge. The climb took place during a howling snowstorm through knee-deep snow. That night 13 emigrants died.<ref>Hafen and Hafen (1981), pp. 101\u2013107, 126</ref><ref>Bartholomew and Arrington (1993), pp. 11\u201318</ref><ref>Christy (1997), pp 37\u201339.</ref>\n\nOn October 19, the Martin Company was about {{convert|110|mi|km}} further east, making its last crossing of the [[North Platte River]] near present-day [[Casper, Wyoming]].<ref>Christy (1997).</ref> Shortly after completing the crossing, the blizzard struck. Many members of the company suffered from [[hypothermia]] or [[frostbite]] after wading through the frigid river. They set up camp at Red Bluffs, unable to continue forward through the snow. Meanwhile, the original scouting party continued eastward until it reached a small vacant fort at [[Devil's Gate (Wyoming)|Devil's Gate]], where they had been instructed to wait for the rest of the rescue party if they had not found the Martin Company. When the main rescue party rejoined them, another scouting party consisting of [[Joseph Angell Young|Joseph Young]], Abel Garr, and [[Daniel Webster Jones (Mormon)|Daniel Webster Jones]] was sent forward. The Martin company remained in their camp at Red Bluffs for nine days until the three scouts finally arrived on October 28. By the time the scouts arrived, 56 members of the company had died. The scouts urged the emigrants to begin moving again. During this interval, the party was providentially met by [[Ephraim Hanks]], bringing meat from a recently slaughtered buffalo, likely saving many lives as the nutritive value of the protein and fat in the meat was much higher than that of the exhausted flour supplies, etc. He also performed many blessings and helped in some amputations, etc. to stop the progression of the frostbite and gangrene that would have otherwise killed more members of the company. Three days later the main rescue party met the Martin Company and the Hodgett and Hunt wagon companies and helped them on to Devil's Gate.<ref>Hafen and Hafen (1981), pp. 108\u2013116, 126</ref><ref>Bartholomew and Arrington (1993), pp. 21\u201325</ref><ref>Christy (1997), pp. 39\u201347.</ref>\n\nGeorge D. Grant, who headed the rescue party, reported to Young:<ref>Hafen and Hafen (1981), p. 228</ref>\n\n{{quote|It is not of much use for me to attempt to give a description of the situation of these people, for this you will learn from [others]; but you can imagine between five and six hundred men, women and children, worn down by drawing hand carts through snow and mud; fainting by the wayside; falling, chilled by the cold; children crying, their limbs stiffened by cold, their feet bleeding and some of them bare to snow and frost. The sight is almost too much for the stoutest of us; but we go on doing all we can, not doubting nor despairing.}}\n\n[[File:MartinsCove.JPG|thumb|right|300px|[[Martin's Cove]], [[Wyoming]]]]\nAt Devil's Gate the rescue party unloaded the baggage carried in the wagons of the Hodgett and Hunt wagon companies that had been following the Martin Company so the wagons could be used to transport the weakest emigrants. A small group, led by Daniel Webster Jones, remained at Devil's Gate over the winter to protect the property. The severe weather forced the Martin Company to halt for another five days; the company moved into [[Martin's Cove]], a few miles west of Devil's Gate, as it was much more protected than the open plains just to the east. This is where the famous crossing of the Sweetwater River on November 4 occurred (see more information below). During this season, the River, though shallow &ndash; about {{convert|2|ft|m|abbr=off}} &ndash; was also {{convert|90|to|120|ft|m|abbr=off}} wide. The stream temperature was frigid and clogged with floating ice. Some of the men of the rescue party spent hours pulling the carts and carrying many of the emigrants across the river.<ref name=\"Orton 2006, pp. 10\u201314\">Orton (2006), pp. 10\u201314.</ref> However, many members of the company crossed the river themselves, some even pulling their own handcarts across.<ref name=\"Orton 2006, pp. 21\u201324\">Orton (2006), pp. 21\u201324.</ref><ref>Hafen and Hafen (1981), pp. 132\u2013134</ref><ref>Bartholomew and Arrington (1993), pp. 25\u201328.</ref>\n\nThe rescue parties escorted the emigrants from both companies to Utah through more snow and severe weather while their members continued to suffer death from disease and exposure. The Willie Company arrived in Salt Lake City on November 9; 68 members of the company had lost their lives.<ref>Hafen and Hafen (1981), pp. 127\u2013131</ref><ref>Bartholomew and Arrington (1993), pp. 17\u201319.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, a backup relief party of 77 teams and wagons was making its way east to provide additional assistance to the Martin Company. After passing Fort Bridger the leaders of the backup party concluded that the Martin Company must have wintered east of the Rockies, so they turned back. When word of the returning backup relief party was communicated to Young, he ordered the courier to return and tell them to turn back east and continue until they found the handcart company, but several days had been lost. On November 18, the backup party met the Martin Company with the greatly needed supplies. At last all the members of the handcart party were now able to ride in wagons. The 104 wagons carrying the Martin Company arrived in Salt Lake City on November 30; at least 145 members of the company had lost their lives. Many of the survivors had to have fingers, toes, or limbs amputated due to severe frostbite.<ref>Hafen & Hafen (1981), pp. 134\u2013138; Bartholomew and Arrington (1993), pp. 28\u201337.</ref>\n\nAfter the companies arrived in Utah, the residents generously opened their homes to the arriving emigrants, feeding and caring for them over the winter. The emigrants would eventually go on to Latter-day Saint settlements throughout Utah and the West.<ref>Hafen and Hafen (1981), pp. 138\u2013140</ref><ref>Bartholomew and Arrington (1993), pp. 39\u201342.</ref>\n\n===Sweetwater River crossing ===\nOne of the most persistent and popular stories regarding the Mormon pioneers was about three of the rescuers who helped the pioneers cross Sweetwater River.<ref name=Roberts2008>{{cite book\n | last=Roberts\n | first=David\n | title=Devil's Gate: Brigham Young and the Great Mormon Handcart Tragedy\n | year=2008\n | publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]\n | location=New York\n | isbn=978-1-4165-3988-9\n | url=https://archive.org/details/devilsgatebrigha00robe\n }}</ref>{{rp|242}}  The most popular telling, by Solomon Kimball, states:\n\n{{quote|Three eighteen-year-old boys belonging to the relief party came to the rescue; and to the astonishment of all who saw, carried nearly every member of that ill-fated handcart company across the snow-bound stream.

Orton believes Palmer was trying to emphasize Webster's character, rather than give a definitive statement on the faithfulness of all the members of the Willie Martin handcart company, and finds it unlikely that it was an exact quote. Orton also finds it unlikely that Webster knew all of the survivors, given that they spread throughout Utah after they arrived and didn't have a reunion until after Webster's death.

Never again would a handcart company depart Florence later than July 7. The construction of the handcarts was modified to strengthen them and reduce repairs. The handcarts would now be regularly greased. Arrangements were made to replenish supplies along the route.<ref>Hafen and Hafen (1981), pp. 143\u2013144.</ref>\n\nBy 1857 the Perpetual Emigration Fund was exhausted; almost all of the handcart emigrants that year and in subsequent years had to pay their own way. With the increased cost, the number of handcart emigrants dropped from nearly 2,000 in 1856 to about 480 in 1857.<ref>Hafen and Hafen (1981), pp. 148\u2013149, 193.</ref> Nevertheless, in 1857 two companies made the trek, both arriving in Salt Lake City by September 13. Perhaps the most notable incident was when a captain of the U.S. Army's [[Utah War|Utah Expedition]], on its way to Utah to enforce federal authority over Young and the Latter-day Saints, donated an ox to the hungry emigrants.<ref>Hafen and Hafen (1981), pp. 153\u2013164.</ref>\n\nWith the uncertainty caused by the [[Utah War]], the church called off all European emigration for 1858. In 1859 one handcart company crossed the plains. The emigrants were now able to travel by rail to [[Saint Joseph, Missouri]], after which they went by riverboat to Florence, where they were outfitted with handcarts and supplies. When the 1859 company reached Fort Laramie, they discovered their food was running dangerously short, so they cut back on rations. When they reached Devil's Gate the last flour was distributed. Emigrant Ebeneezer B. Beesley recalled an incident in which a group of rough [[mountain man|mountain men]] fed the hungry emigrants. One of the mountain men then asked a young woman from the company to stay with him, which the tired woman agreed to do. (William Atkin recalled another version of the story in which two young women married two mountain men.)<ref>Hafen and Hafen (1981), pp. 173\u2013174.</ref> The hunger worsened when expected supplies were not available when they reached the [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green River]]. Three days later wagons from Utah carrying provisions finally rescued the famished emigrants.<ref>Hafen and Hafen (1981), pp. 165\u2013178.</ref>\n\nThe last two handcart companies made the journey in 1860, again following the route through St. Joseph. Although the journey proved to be difficult for the emigrants, these companies had relatively uneventful trips and experienced little loss of life.<ref>Hafen and Hafen (1981), pp. 179\u2013190.</ref>\n\nThe outbreak of the [[American Civil War]] likely hastened the handcart system's demise by disrupting immigration from Europe and placing severe restrictions on rail travel from the East Coast. In any case, by the end of that conflict the church had implemented a new system of emigration in which wagon trains travelled east from Salt Lake City in the spring and returned with emigrants in the summer. The [[First Transcontinental Railroad|transcontinental railroad]] was being constructed, and the railroad terminus gradually moved westward, shortening the trip.<ref>Hafen and Hafen (1981), pp. 191\u2013192.</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Handcart company\n! scope=\"col\"| Captain \n! scope=\"col\"| Ship \n! scope=\"col\"| Arrived Iowa City \n! scope=\"col\"| Departed Iowa City \n! scope=\"col\"| Departed Florence \n! scope=\"col\"| Number of individuals\n! scope=\"col\"|  Number died en route \n! scope=\"col\"| Arrived Salt Lake City\n|-\n!

Arthur King Peters described the importance of this part of Mormon history in ''Seven Trails West'':<ref>Peters (1996), p. 145.</ref>\n\n{{quote|This heroic episode of Mormon history exemplifies many of the enduring qualities of nascent Mormonism itself: thorough organization, iron discipline, unswerving devotion to a cause, and limitless self-sacrifice. ... The true Mormon Trail was not on the prairie but in the spirit.}}\nWallace Stegner praised the examples of those of the handcart companies, particularly in comparison to other pioneer parties:<ref>Stegner (1956), p. 85.</ref>\n\n{{quote|Perhaps their suffering seems less dramatic because the handcart pioneers bore it meekly, praising God, instead of fighting for life with the ferocity of animals and eating their dead to keep their own life beating, as both the [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont|Fremont]] and [[Donner Party|Donner]] parties did. ... But if courage and endurance make a story, if humankindness and helpfulness and brotherly love in the midst of raw horror are worth recording, this half-forgotten episode of the Mormon migration is one of the great tales of the West and of America.}}\n\n===Reenactments===\n[[Historical reenactment|Reenactments]], in which a group dressed in 19th-century garb travels for one or more days pushing and pulling handcarts, have become a popular activity among LDS [[ward (LDS Church)|wards]], youth groups, and families.<ref>For example: {{citation |url= http://www.utsandiego.com/uniontrib/20060715/news_lz1c15trail.html |title= Trials of the trail |first= Sandi |last= Dolbee San |date= July 15, 2006 |newspaper= [[San Diego Union-Tribune]] |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131021190600/http://www.utsandiego.com/uniontrib/20060715/news_lz1c15trail.html |archivedate= October 21, 2013 }}; {{citation |url= http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/get_out/article_18f0a27c-2572-5773-8f97-f454a1b762b0.html |title= Gilbert Ward connects with ancestors by re-enacting Mormon trek |first= Lawn |last= Griffiths |date= November 12, 2005 |newspaper= [[East Valley Tribune]] }}; {{citation |url= http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/get_out/article_e89f4e4f-5829-5fa3-9433-ada7aff14002.html |title= Faith of the pioneers |first= Lawn |last= Griffiths |date= June 19, 2004 |newspaper= East Valley Tribune }}</ref>\n\nThe first known modern-era reenactment took place in 1966 from [[Henefer, Utah]], to the mouth of [[Emigration Canyon]] by young men from [[Phoenix, Arizona]], using handcarts between metal wheels repurposed from old farm wagons. In 1968, 44 girls from [[Long Beach, California]] reenacted that same stretch of the Mormon Trail with homemade handcarts. From the mid-1970s until the early 1990s, participation in handcart reenactments were offered at BYU in a program, spearheaded by Doug Cloward, that was a [[wilderness survival]] activity for [[BYU Division of Continuing Education#Conferences and workshops|youth conference]] participants. Beginning in 1977, similar treks were offered as part of [[Ricks College]]'s [[outdoor recreation]] program, on connected [[jeep trail]]s from [[Rexburg, Idaho]] and into [[Montana]].<ref>https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900015034/op-ed-ever-wondered-where-the-mormon-youth-trek-phenomenon-came-from.html</ref>\n\nThe reenactments have been lauded by LDS leaders; for example, [[M.

The trek was disastrous for two of the companies, which started their journey dangerously late and were caught by heavy snow and severe temperatures in central [[Wyoming]]. Despite a dramatic rescue effort, more than 210 of the 980 pioneers in these two companies died along the way. John Chislett, a survivor, wrote, \"Many a father pulled his cart, with his little children on it, until the day preceding his death.\"<ref>Hafen and Hafen (1981), p. 102.</ref>\n\nAlthough fewer than 10 percent of the 1846\u201368 [[Latter-day Saint]] emigrants made the journey west using handcarts, the handcart pioneers have become an important symbol in LDS culture, representing the faithfulness and sacrifice of the pioneer generation. They continue to be recognized and honored in events such as [[Pioneer Day (Utah)|Pioneer Day]], church pageants, and similar commemorations.\n\n==Background to the migration==\n{{details|Mormon pioneers}}\nThe [[Latter Day Saint movement|Latter Day Saints]] were first organized in 1830. Early members of the church often encountered hostility, primarily due to their practice of withdrawing from secular society and gathering in locales to practice their distinct religious beliefs. Their neighbors felt threatened by the church's rapid growth in numbers, its tendency to vote as a [[voting bloc|bloc]] and acquire political power, its claims of divine favor, and, later, the practice of [[plural marriage|polygamy]].<ref>O'Dea (1957), pp. 41\u201349, 72\u201375.</ref> Violence directed against the church and its members caused the body of the church to move from [[Ohio]] to [[Missouri]], then to [[Illinois]]. Despite the frequent moves, church members were unable to escape opposition, which culminated in the [[Missouri Executive Order 44|extermination order]] against all Mormons living in the state by Missouri Governor [[Lilburn Boggs]] in 1838 and the [[Death of Joseph Smith|death]] of their leader [[Joseph Smith]] in 1844. [[Brigham Young]] said that he had received divine direction to organize the church members and head beyond the western frontier of the United States.<ref>O'Dea (1957), pp. 1\u201385</ref><ref>Allen and Leonard (1976), pp. 103\u2013256.</ref>\n\n==Need for handcart companies==\nSoon after the first Mormon pioneers reached Utah in 1847, the church began encouraging its converts in the [[British Isles]] and elsewhere in Europe to [[Immigration to the United States|emigrate]] to Utah. From 1849 to 1855, about 16,000 European [[Latter-day Saints]] traveled to the United States by ship, through the eastern states by rail, and to Utah by ox and wagon. Although most of these emigrants paid their own expenses, the church established the [[Perpetual Emigration Fund]] to provide financial assistance for poor emigrants to trek west, which they would repay as they were able. Contributions to expand the fund were encouraged.<ref>Hafen and Hafen (1981), pp. 22\u201327.</ref>\n\nWhen contributions and loan repayments dropped off in 1855 after a poor harvest in Utah, Young decided to begin using handcarts because the church members who remained in Europe were mostly poor. Young also believed it would speed the journey.<ref>Hafen and Hafen (1981), pp. 28\u201331.</ref>\n\nYoung proposed the plan in a letter to [[Franklin D. Richards (Mormon apostle)|Franklin D. Richards]], [[Mission president|president]] of the European [[Mission (LDS Church)|Mission]], in September 1855. Young's letter was published in the ''[[Millennial Star]]'', the church's England-based periodical, on December 22, 1855, along with an editorial by Richards endorsing the project. The cost of the migration was expected to be reduced by one-third. The response was overwhelming \u2013 in 1856 the Perpetual Emigration Fund supported the travel of 2,012 European emigrants, compared with 1,161 the year before.<ref>Hafen and Hafen (1981), pp. 29\u201334, 46.</ref>\n\n==Outfitting==\nEmigrants departed from an English port (generally [[Liverpool]]) and travelled by ship to [[New York City|New York]] or [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], then by railroad to [[Iowa City, Iowa]], the western terminus of the rail line, where they would be outfitted with handcarts and other supplies.<ref>Hafen and Hafen (1981), pp. 40, 44, 91, 153, 157, 180.</ref>\n[[File:PlattCrossing.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Reenactment: Pioneers crossing the [[Platte River]], from PBS documentary ''Sweetwater Rescue'' ]]\n\nBuilt to Young's design, the handcarts resembled a large [[wheelbarrow]], with two wheels {{convert|5|ft|m|abbr=off|spell=in}} in diameter and a single axle {{convert|4+1/2|ft|m|spell=in}} wide, and weighing {{convert|60|lb|kg}}. Running along each side of the bed were seven-foot (2.1 m) pull shafts ending with a three-foot (0.9&nbsp;m) crossbar at the front. The crossbar allowed the carts to be pushed or pulled. Cargo was carried in a box about three feet by four feet (0.9&nbsp;m by 1.2&nbsp;m), with {{convert|8|in|m}} walls. The handcarts generally carried up to {{convert|250|lb|kg}} of supplies and luggage, though they were capable of handling loads as heavy as {{convert|500|lb|kg}}. Carts used in the first year's migration were made entirely of wood (\"Iowa hickory or oak\"); in later years a stronger design was substituted, which included metal elements.<ref>Hafen and Hafen (1981), pp. 53\u201355.</ref><ref>Dekker (2006), p. 45</ref><ref>{{citation|last=Pratt|first=Steve |title=1856\u201360, Handcarts: Construction Plans |work=Heritage Gateways |publisher=Utah State Office of Education and [[Utah System of Higher Education]] |origyear=1989 |year=2006 |url=http://heritage.uen.org/companies/Wcc558845eddb9.htm |accessdate=2013-06-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522184018/http://heritage.uen.org/companies/Wcc558845eddb9.htm |archivedate=2013-05-22 }}</ref>\n\nThe handcart companies were organized using the handcarts and sleeping tents as the primary units. Five people were assigned per handcart, with each individual limited to {{convert|17|lb|kg}} of clothing and bedding. Each round tent, supported by a center pole, housed 20 occupants and was supervised by a tent captain. Five tents were supervised by the captain of a hundred (or \"sub-captain\"). Provisions for each group of one hundred emigrants were carried in an ox wagon, and were distributed by the tent captains.<ref>Hafen and Hafen (1981), pp. 58\u201359, 157</ref><ref>Dekker (2006), p. 41.</ref>\n\n==1856: First three companies==\nThe first two ships departed England in late March and mid-April and sailed to Boston. The emigrants spent several weeks in Iowa City, where they constructed their handcarts and were outfitted with supplies before beginning their trek of about {{convert|1,300|mi|km}}.<ref>Hafen and Hafen (1981), pp. 43\u201358.</ref>\n\n[[File:Mormon Hand-Cart Train - History of Iowa.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Mormon handcart train in Iowa, 1903 illustration]]\nAbout 815 emigrants from the first two ships were organized into the first three handcart companies, headed by captains [[Edmund Ellsworth]], Daniel D. McArthur, and [[Edward Bunker (Mormon)|Edward Bunker]].<ref>Exact counts of the number of emigrants are not possible both because of incomplete records and because some emigrants dropped out along the way. For example, see Hafen and Hafen (1981), p. 199.</ref> The captains were [[Mormon missionary|missionaries]] returning to their homes in Utah and were familiar with the route. Most of the sub-captains were also returning missionaries.<ref>Hafen and Hafen (1981), pp. 53\u201359.</ref>\n\nAcross Iowa they followed an existing road about {{convert|275|mi|km}} to [[Council Bluffs, Iowa|Council Bluffs]], following a route that is close to current [[U.S. Route 6]]. After crossing the [[Missouri River]], they paused for a few days at a [[Winter Quarters, Nebraska|Mormon outpost]] in [[Florence, Nebraska]] (now part of [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]]), for repairs, before beginning the remaining {{convert|1,030|mi|km|adj=on}} journey along the [[Mormon Trail]] to Salt Lake City.<ref>Kimball (1979).</ref>\n\nInitial problems with the carts occurred because the wood used to construct them was said to have been \"green timber\", with many more breakdowns than anticipated. When the first handcart company reached Winter Quarters, Edmund Ellsworth had a member of the company \"tin\" the wooden axles and also installed \"thick hoop iron skeins\" which enabled the handcart axles to turn more easily and resist breakage much better.<ref>{{cite web|title=Biography of Edmund Lovell Ellsworth|url=http://www.public.asu.edu/~ellswork/EdmundsBiography.htm|website=Arizona State University|accessdate=June 16, 2014}}</ref> This feature became a standard part of handcarts in following years, including frequent greasing to keep the wheels lubricated. With no method of communicating back up the trail, however, this needed set of fixes did not reach the fourth and fifth companies in time.\n\nThe companies made good time, and their trips were largely uneventful. The emigrant companies included many children and elderly individuals, and pushing and pulling handcarts was difficult work. Journals and recollections describe periods of illness and hunger. Like other companies traveling on the [[Emigrant Trail]], deaths occurred along the way. Hafen and Hafen's ''Handcarts to Zion'' lists 13 deaths from the first company, seven from the second, and fewer than seven from the third. Journal entries reflect the optimism of the handcart pioneers, even amid their hardships:\n\n{{quote|People made fun of us as we walked, pulling our handcarts, but the weather was fine and the roads were excellent and although I was sick and we were very tired at night, still we thought it was a glorious way to go to [[Zion (Mormonism)|Zion]].<ref>Emigrant Priscilla M. Evans of the third company, as quoted by Hafen and Hafen (1981), pp. 82\u201383.</ref>}}\n\nThe first two companies arrived in Salt Lake City on September 26 and the third followed less than a week later. The first three companies were regarded as having demonstrated the feasibility of emigrating using handcarts.<ref>Hafen and Hafen (1981), pp. 59\u201379.</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

The ship ''Thornton'', carrying the emigrants who became the Willie Company, did not leave England until May 4. The leader of the Latter-day Saints on the ''Thornton'' was [[James G. Willie]]. Another eleven days passed before the ''Horizon,'' departed, carrying the emigrants who later formed the Martin Company. The late departures may have been the result of difficulties in procuring ships in response to the unexpected demand, but the results would be tragic.<ref>Hafen and Hafen (1981), p. 91.</ref>\n\nWith slow communications in the era before the transatlantic telegraph, the church's agents in Iowa City were not expecting the additional emigrants and had to make frantic preparations for their arrival. Critical weeks were spent hastily assembling the carts and outfitting the companies. When the companies reached Florence, additional time was lost making repairs to the poorly built carts.<ref>Hafen and Hafen (1981), pp. 92\u201394.</ref> Emigrant John Chislett describes the problems with the carts:<ref>Hafen and Hafen (1981), pp. 99\u2013100.</ref>\n\n{{quote|The axles and boxes being of wood, and being ground out by the dust that found its way there in spite of our efforts to keep it out, together with the extra weight put on the carts, had the effect of breaking the axles at the shoulder. All kinds of expedients were resorted to as remedies for the growing evil, but with variable success. Some wrapped their axles with leather obtained from bootlegs; others with tin, obtained by sacrificing tin-plates, kettles, or buckets from their mess outfit. Besides these inconveniences, there was felt a great lack of a proper lubricator. Of anything suitable for this purpose we had none at all.}}\n\nPrior to the Willie Company departing Florence, the company met to debate the wisdom of such a late departure. Because the emigrants were unfamiliar with the trail and the climate, they deferred to the returning missionaries and church agents. One of the returning missionaries, [[Levi Savage Jr.|Levi Savage]], urged them to spend the winter in Nebraska. He argued that such a late departure with a company consisting of the elderly, women, and young children would lead to suffering, sickness, and even death. All of the other church [[Elder (Mormonism)|elders]] argued that the trip should go forward, expressing optimism that the company would be protected by [[miracle|divine intervention]]. Some members of the company, perhaps as many as 100, decided to spend the winter in Florence or in Iowa, but the majority, about 404 in number (including Savage) continued the journey west. The Willie Company left Florence on August 17 and the Martin Company on August 27. Two ox-wagon trains, led by captains W.B. Hodgett and John A. Hunt, followed the Martin Company.<ref>Hafen and Hafen (1981), pp. 96\u201397.</ref>\n\nNear [[Wood River, Nebraska|Wood River]], [[Nebraska]], a herd of [[American bison|bison]] caused the Willie Company's cattle to [[stampede]], and nearly 30 cattle were lost. Left without enough cattle to pull all of the wagons, each handcart was required to take on an additional {{convert|100|lb|kg}} of flour.<ref>Hafen and Hafen (1981), p. 100.</ref>\n\nIn early September, Franklin D. Richards, returning from Europe where he had served as the church's [[mission president]], passed the emigrant companies. Richards and the 12 returning missionaries who accompanied him, traveling in carriages and light wagons pulled by horses and mules, pressed on to Utah to obtain assistance for the emigrants.<ref>Hafen and Hafen (1981), pp. 97\u201398, 119.</ref><ref>Bartholomew and Arrington (1993), p. 5.</ref> The Loader family and Harrison family were with the Martin Company. Patience Loader Rozsa Archer (at the time of their journey the twenty-nine-year-old Patience Loader) later wrote in her autobiography (c.1887) of the struggle:<blockquote>[T]his was in the month of '''september [1856]''' and our dear father was begining to get very weak and food was geting Short day by day his strength began to fail him Some days he was not able to pull the cart but had to walk[.]<ref>{{Cite book|last=Petree|first=Sandra Ailey|title=Recollections of Past Days the Autobiography of Patience Loader Rozsa Archer|publisher=Utah State University Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=Logan, Utah|pages=70}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Disaster and rescue===\nIn early October the two companies reached [[Fort Laramie National Historic Site|Fort Laramie]], Wyoming, where they expected to be restocked with provisions, but no provisions were pre-stocked for them. The companies cut back food rations, hoping that their supplies would last until help could be sent from Utah. To lighten their loads, the Martin Company cut the luggage allowance to {{convert|10|lb|kg}} per person, discarding clothing and blankets that soon would be desperately needed.<ref>Hafen and Hafen (1981), pp. 101, 108.</ref><ref>Bartholomew and Arrington (1993), pp. 3\u20134.</ref>\n\n[[File:Man3.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Dramatization of man pulling [[handcart]] through snow]]\nOn October 4, the Richards party reached Salt Lake City and conferred with Brigham Young and other church leaders. The next morning the church was meeting in a [[General Conference (LDS Church)|general conference]], where Young and the other speakers called on church members to provide wagons, [[mule]]s, supplies, and [[teamster]]s for a rescue mission. On the morning of October 7, the first rescue party left Salt Lake City with 16 wagon-loads of food and supplies, pulled by four-mule teams with 27 young men serving as teamsters and rescuers. The party elected George D. Grant as their captain. Throughout October more wagon trains were assembled, and by the end of the month 250 relief wagons were on the road.<ref>Hafen and Hafen (1981), pp. 119\u2013125.</ref><ref>Bartholomew and Arrington (1993), pp. 5\u201311.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the Willie and Martin companies were running out of food and encountering bitterly cold temperatures. On October 19, a blizzard struck the region, halting the two companies and the relief party. The Willie Company was along the [[Sweetwater River (Wyoming)|Sweetwater River]] approaching the [[Continental Divide]]. A scouting party sent ahead by the main rescue party found and greeted the emigrants, gave them a small amount of flour, encouraged them that rescue was near, and then rushed onward to try to locate the Martin Company.<ref>The various sources disagree regarding the identities of the members of first \"express team\" that found the Willie Company. Hafen and Hafen [1960] (1981), quoting emigrant John Chislett, name [[Joseph Angell Young|Joseph Young]] and Stephen Taylor. Jones (1890), a member of the rescue party, names Cyrus Wheelock and Stephen Taylor. Bartholomew and Arrington (1992) name Joseph Young, Abel Garr, and Cyrus Wheelock.</ref> The members of the Willie Company had just reached the end of their flour supplies. They began slaughtering the handful of broken-down cattle that still remained while their death toll mounted. On October 20, Captain Willie and Joseph Elder went ahead by mule through the snow to locate the supply train and inform them of the company's desperate situation. They arrived at the rescue party's campsite near [[South Pass (Wyoming)|South Pass]] that evening, and by the next evening the rescue party reached the Willie Company and provided them with food and assistance. Half of the rescue party remained to assist the Willie Company while the other half pressed forward to assist the Martin Company. The difficulties of the Willie Company were not yet over. On October 23, the second day after the main rescue party had arrived, the Willie Company faced the most difficult section of the trail\u2014the ascent up Rocky Ridge. The climb took place during a howling snowstorm through knee-deep snow. That night 13 emigrants died.<ref>Hafen and Hafen (1981), pp. 101\u2013107, 126</ref><ref>Bartholomew and Arrington (1993), pp. 11\u201318</ref><ref>Christy (1997), pp 37\u201339.</ref>\n\nOn October 19, the Martin Company was about {{convert|110|mi|km}} further east, making its last crossing of the [[North Platte River]] near present-day [[Casper, Wyoming]].<ref>Christy (1997).</ref> Shortly after completing the crossing, the blizzard struck. Many members of the company suffered from [[hypothermia]] or [[frostbite]] after wading through the frigid river. They set up camp at Red Bluffs, unable to continue forward through the snow. Meanwhile, the original scouting party continued eastward until it reached a small vacant fort at [[Devil's Gate (Wyoming)|Devil's Gate]], where they had been instructed to wait for the rest of the rescue party if they had not found the Martin Company. When the main rescue party rejoined them, another scouting party consisting of [[Joseph Angell Young|Joseph Young]], Abel Garr, and [[Daniel Webster Jones (Mormon)|Daniel Webster Jones]] was sent forward. The Martin company remained in their camp at Red Bluffs for nine days until the three scouts finally arrived on October 28. By the time the scouts arrived, 56 members of the company had died. The scouts urged the emigrants to begin moving again. During this interval, the party was providentially met by [[Ephraim Hanks]], bringing meat from a recently slaughtered buffalo, likely saving many lives as the nutritive value of the protein and fat in the meat was much higher than that of the exhausted flour supplies, etc. He also performed many blessings and helped in some amputations, etc. to stop the progression of the frostbite and gangrene that would have otherwise killed more members of the company. Three days later the main rescue party met the Martin Company and the Hodgett and Hunt wagon companies and helped them on to Devil's Gate.<ref>Hafen and Hafen (1981), pp. 108\u2013116, 126</ref><ref>Bartholomew and Arrington (1993), pp. 21\u201325</ref><ref>Christy (1997), pp. 39\u201347.</ref>\n\nGeorge D.

A small group, led by Daniel Webster Jones, remained at Devil's Gate over the winter to protect the property. The severe weather forced the Martin Company to halt for another five days; the company moved into [[Martin's Cove]], a few miles west of Devil's Gate, as it was much more protected than the open plains just to the east. This is where the famous crossing of the Sweetwater River on November 4 occurred (see more information below). During this season, the River, though shallow &ndash; about {{convert|2|ft|m|abbr=off}} &ndash; was also {{convert|90|to|120|ft|m|abbr=off}} wide. The stream temperature was frigid and clogged with floating ice. Some of the men of the rescue party spent hours pulling the carts and carrying many of the emigrants across the river.<ref name=\"Orton 2006, pp. 10\u201314\">Orton (2006), pp. 10\u201314.</ref> However, many members of the company crossed the river themselves, some even pulling their own handcarts across.<ref name=\"Orton 2006, pp. 21\u201324\">Orton (2006), pp. 21\u201324.</ref><ref>Hafen and Hafen (1981), pp. 132\u2013134</ref><ref>Bartholomew and Arrington (1993), pp. 25\u201328.</ref>\n\nThe rescue parties escorted the emigrants from both companies to Utah through more snow and severe weather while their members continued to suffer death from disease and exposure. The Willie Company arrived in Salt Lake City on November 9; 68 members of the company had lost their lives.<ref>Hafen and Hafen (1981), pp. 127\u2013131</ref><ref>Bartholomew and Arrington (1993), pp. 17\u201319.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, a backup relief party of 77 teams and wagons was making its way east to provide additional assistance to the Martin Company. After passing Fort Bridger the leaders of the backup party concluded that the Martin Company must have wintered east of the Rockies, so they turned back. When word of the returning backup relief party was communicated to Young, he ordered the courier to return and tell them to turn back east and continue until they found the handcart company, but several days had been lost. On November 18, the backup party met the Martin Company with the greatly needed supplies. At last all the members of the handcart party were now able to ride in wagons. The 104 wagons carrying the Martin Company arrived in Salt Lake City on November 30; at least 145 members of the company had lost their lives. Many of the survivors had to have fingers, toes, or limbs amputated due to severe frostbite.<ref>Hafen & Hafen (1981), pp. 134\u2013138; Bartholomew and Arrington (1993), pp. 28\u201337.</ref>\n\nAfter the companies arrived in Utah, the residents generously opened their homes to the arriving emigrants, feeding and caring for them over the winter.

The strain was so terrible, and the exposure so great, that in later years all the boys died from the effects of it.

Palmer said that he was paraphrasing Webster, and given the lapse of time and the casual nature of a Sunday School class, Orton believes it unlikely to be an exact quote. Orton believes Palmer was trying to emphasize Webster's character, rather than give a definitive statement on the faithfulness of all the members of the Willie Martin handcart company, and finds it unlikely that it was an exact quote. Orton also finds it unlikely that Webster knew all of the survivors, given that they spread throughout Utah after they arrived and didn't have a reunion until after Webster's death. Orton believes Webster was only referring to the pioneers in Cedar City, where the quote was given.<ref name=Orton2006 />\n\n===Responsibility for the tragedy===\nAmerican West historian, [[Wallace Stegner]], described the inadequate planning and improvident decisions leading to the tragedy when he wrote,<ref>Stegner (1992), p. 222.</ref>\n\n{{quote|In urging the method upon Europe's poor, Brigham and the priesthood would over-reach themselves; in shepherding them from Liverpool to the valley, the ordinarily reliable missionary and emigration organization would break down at several critical points; in accepting the assurances of their leaders and the wishful importunities of their own hope, the emigrants would commit themselves to greater sacrifices than even the Nauvoo refugees; and in rallying from compound fatal error to bring the survivors in, the priesthood and the people of Mormondom would show themselves at their compassionate and efficient best.}}\n\nAs early as November 2, 1856, while the Willie and Martin companies were still making their way to safety, Brigham Young responded to criticism of his own leadership by rebuking Franklin Richards and Daniel Spencer for allowing the companies to leave so late.<ref>Christy (1997), pp. 22\u201323</ref><ref>Stegner (1992), pp. 256\u2013258.</ref><ref> Richards was the highest ranking church official in the area at the time the companies left Florence, and Spencer was the church's agent in Iowa City.</ref> However, many authors argued that Young, as author of the plan, was responsible.

Never again would a handcart company depart Florence later than July 7. The construction of the handcarts was modified to strengthen them and reduce repairs. The handcarts would now be regularly greased. Arrangements were made to replenish supplies along the route.<ref>Hafen and Hafen (1981), pp. 143\u2013144.</ref>\n\nBy 1857 the Perpetual Emigration Fund was exhausted; almost all of the handcart emigrants that year and in subsequent years had to pay their own way. With the increased cost, the number of handcart emigrants dropped from nearly 2,000 in 1856 to about 480 in 1857.<ref>Hafen and Hafen (1981), pp. 148\u2013149, 193.</ref> Nevertheless, in 1857 two companies made the trek, both arriving in Salt Lake City by September 13. Perhaps the most notable incident was when a captain of the U.S. Army's [[Utah War|Utah Expedition]], on its way to Utah to enforce federal authority over Young and the Latter-day Saints, donated an ox to the hungry emigrants.<ref>Hafen and Hafen (1981), pp. 153\u2013164.</ref>\n\nWith the uncertainty caused by the [[Utah War]], the church called off all European emigration for 1858. In 1859 one handcart company crossed the plains. The emigrants were now able to travel by rail to [[Saint Joseph, Missouri]], after which they went by riverboat to Florence, where they were outfitted with handcarts and supplies. When the 1859 company reached Fort Laramie, they discovered their food was running dangerously short, so they cut back on rations. When they reached Devil's Gate the last flour was distributed. Emigrant Ebeneezer B. Beesley recalled an incident in which a group of rough [[mountain man|mountain men]] fed the hungry emigrants. One of the mountain men then asked a young woman from the company to stay with him, which the tired woman agreed to do. (William Atkin recalled another version of the story in which two young women married two mountain men.)<ref>Hafen and Hafen (1981), pp. 173\u2013174.</ref> The hunger worsened when expected supplies were not available when they reached the [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green River]]. Three days later wagons from Utah carrying provisions finally rescued the famished emigrants.<ref>Hafen and Hafen (1981), pp. 165\u2013178.</ref>\n\nThe last two handcart companies made the journey in 1860, again following the route through St. Joseph. Although the journey proved to be difficult for the emigrants, these companies had relatively uneventful trips and experienced little loss of life.<ref>Hafen and Hafen (1981), pp. 179\u2013190.</ref>\n\nThe outbreak of the [[American Civil War]] likely hastened the handcart system's demise by disrupting immigration from Europe and placing severe restrictions on rail travel from the East Coast. In any case, by the end of that conflict the church had implemented a new system of emigration in which wagon trains travelled east from Salt Lake City in the spring and returned with emigrants in the summer. The [[First Transcontinental Railroad|transcontinental railroad]] was being constructed, and the railroad terminus gradually moved westward, shortening the trip.<ref>Hafen and Hafen (1981), pp. 191\u2013192.</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Handcart company\n! scope=\"col\"| Captain \n! scope=\"col\"| Ship \n! scope=\"col\"| Arrived Iowa City \n! scope=\"col\"| Departed Iowa City \n! scope=\"col\"| Departed Florence \n! scope=\"col\"| Number of individuals\n! scope=\"col\"|  Number died en route \n! scope=\"col\"| Arrived Salt Lake City\n|-\n!

In 1968, 44 girls from [[Long Beach, California]] reenacted that same stretch of the Mormon Trail with homemade handcarts. From the mid-1970s until the early 1990s, participation in handcart reenactments were offered at BYU in a program, spearheaded by Doug Cloward, that was a [[wilderness survival]] activity for [[BYU Division of Continuing Education#Conferences and workshops|youth conference]] participants.

Front row: [[Ike Eisenmann]] and [[Jared Martin]] ]]\n'''''The Fantastic Journey''''' is an American [[science fiction]] television series that was originally aired on [[NBC]] from February 3 through June 16, 1977. Intended to run 13 episodes, as a [[mid-season replacement]], NBC cancelled the series in April, after the ninth episode aired. A tenth episode, already produced, was [[burning off|burned off]] two months later.\n\n== Premise ==\nThe series concerns a family and their associates who charter a boat out into the [[Caribbean]] for a scientific expedition.  After an encounter in the area of the [[Bermuda Triangle]] with an unnatural luminous green cloud accompanied by the eerie disembodied sound of [[ship's bells]], the group find themselves shipwrecked on a mysterious uncharted island from which they are unable to escape.\n[[File:Christina Hart Jared Martin The Fantastic Journey 1977.JPG|220px|thumb|[[Christina Hart]] as Gwenith, with Jared Martin as Varian, in \"An Act of Love\"]]\nThey encounter Varian ([[Jared Martin]]), initially disguised as an [[Arawak]] native, who is later revealed to be from the year 2230.  A 23rd-century pacifist, musician and healer, Varian explains to the travelers that, like he and many before them, they have been caught in a space/time continuum where people from the past, present, future and from other worlds are trapped, co-existing on the island in a series of \"Time Zones\".  The only way home can be found in a place called \"Evoland\", which lies \"far to the rising sun\".  (It was indicated in interviews of the time that Evoland was also the name of the island.) The only way to travel between Time Zones is via invisible gateways that instantaneously transport individuals or groups from one zone to another. In one episode, \"Beyond the Mountain\", the group also encounters a second cloud, which has much the same effect, but which also splits up the group.\n\nAfter the [[television pilot|initial pilot]] story, a steady group of travelers forms around Varian as ''de facto'' leader, and the series then follows this group as they travel across the many Time Zones of the island to find Evoland. On their way, they encounter people from different planets and times who are also trapped on the island and who have adapted to their plight in different ways. The pilot initially suggested the historical past would be explored; however, the producers of the show rapidly adopted a consistently futuristic tone during the series following pressure from the network. They also dropped three characters after the pilot, as they wanted a more exotic group of travelers, hence the arrival of Liana and Willoway. Liana disappears from the last two episodes when Katie Saylor fell ill.\n\n==Cast==\n* Varian ([[Jared Martin]]): \"A man from the 23rd century possessing awesome powers\", Varian generally uses a kind of crystalline \"tuning fork\" device called the Sonic Energizer through which he focuses his thoughts into what is described as a sonic manipulation of matter.  The device is completely useless in anyone else's hands, and seems capable of a huge variety of tasks, from opening doors to disrupting electrical systems to large scale acts of destruction, as well as its apparently intended function as a diagnostic and healing device. Following the departure of Professor Paul Jordan at the end of the pilot film, Varian takes over as ''de facto'' leader to the travelers and adopts a parental role over Paul's teenage son, Scott (most notable in episodes such as \"An Act of Love\" and \"Turnabout\").\n* Scott Jordan ([[Ike Eisenmann]]): \"The 13-year-old son of a famous scientist\", Scott has an excellent knowledge of Earth history and events, but is still young and has much to learn.\n* Dr. Fred Walters ([[Carl Franklin]]): \"A young doctor just out of medical school\" whose impulsive and rather hot-headed nature acts as a counterpoint to the calm, pacifistic Varian.  A friend of Scott's father and the only other member of the group from the same time period, the athletic black physician takes the role of protective \"older brother\" with the young teen.\n* Liana ([[Katie Saylor]]): \"Daughter of an [[Atlantis|Atlantean]] father and an [[extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial]] mother\", the beautiful blonde Liana possessed greater than human physical strength (due to her mother being from a [[planet]] with a higher [[gravity]] than [[Earth]]) and powerful [[psychic phenomenon|psychic]] abilities (presumably due to her mixed heritage) which allow her to, among other things, [[telepathic|telepathically]] communicate with animals. Saylor left the show after the episode \"Turnabout\" due to illness. In the next episode \"Riddles\" the reason for her not being present with the group was given that she opted to stay a few days at Coriel to help the inhabitants work out their new government and would catch up with the group later.\n* Dr. Jonathan Willoway ([[Roddy McDowall]]): \"Rebel scientist from the 1960s\" who has a mastery of computers, robotics and scientific knowledge which is quite useful to the group. He is something of a never entirely trustworthy [[black sheep]], basically a cooler version of Doctor Smith from ''[[Lost in Space]]'' without the congenital cowardice, who often tends to do things for his own mysterious reasons. Over the course of the episodes, however, the black-clad Willoway comes to care about Scott and his fellow travelers and becomes more integrated into the group, although Fred makes no secret about still not trusting him which leads to a bickering [[Mr. Spock|Spock]]/[[Leonard McCoy|McCoy]]-style relationship between the two.\n* Sil-El (The Felix Team<ref>http://www.cult.tv/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=210:fantastic-journey&catid=37:series-formats&Itemid=27</ref>): Liana's companion and pet, a \"[[Bicolor cat|tuxedo cat]]\" with which she can communicate telepathically and who sometimes scouts ahead for her, acting as an extra set of eyes and ears.\n\n==Production==\n[[D. C. Fontana]] recalled that once the show had been commissioned, she and the producers had a very short period of time to develop and produce the show before filming commenced. Additional scenes were filmed and inserted into the pilot which introduces the Atlanteans who are the focus of Episode 2, but this new material also quickly moves off-screen the characters Paul, Eve and Jill (who were originally intended to be regulars), as the network wanted a more diverse group of travelers. Also, a subplot involving the travelers finding a 1940s Air Force pilot held prisoner by 16th century pirates was removed from the first episode.\n\nThe show benefited from a larger than normal amount of location filming, with familiar sites such as the Hollywood Hills, Zuma Beach, the Bonaventure Hotel in LA and Griffith Park Observatory all appearing in various episodes. The character Willoway was created specifically with [[Roddy McDowall]] in mind. Fortunately the actor was interested and took the role when approached.\n\nAlthough airing in a time when the nation's interest in the [[Bermuda Triangle]], [[UFO]]s and fantasy was at a height, the show failed to last beyond the ten episodes, having been scheduled as a mid-season replacement (following the failure of another fantasy series, ''[[Gemini Man (TV series)|Gemini Man]]'') against ''[[The Waltons]]'' and ''[[Welcome Back, Kotter]]'', both very popular family shows.  NBC ordered 12 episodes to follow the revised pilot, but production ended early when it was apparent that the ratings were low. The show was either pre-empted or its time-slot changed several times during its short run. By its tenth episode, its ratings had dropped, and it was cancelled. The script for an unproduced eleventh episode, \"Romulus\", was once available on the Internet.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051129041526/http://www.snowcrest.net/fox/journey/index.html |title=The Fantastic Journey: The Internet 'Portal' |last=Vikki |first=Virtual |date=2003-04-06 |website= |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref> Within a few months of its abrupt ending, several of the production team would be producing the thematically similar ''[[Logan's Run (TV series)|Logan's Run]]'' for the Fall 1977 season.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Episode table\n |background=\n |overall=\n |title=\n |titleR=<ref name=\"WGAW\">From the Writers Guild of America, West catalog: {{cite web |url=https://apps.wga.org/coveredprojects/default.aspx |title=Signatory Project Confirmation [search: \"Fantastic Journey\"] |publisher=Writers Guild of America, West |date= |accessdate=March 10, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"U.S.C.O.\" />\n<!-- |director=\n |writer= -->\n |airdate=\n |airdateR=<ref name=\"U.S.C.O.\">From the United States Copyright Office catalog: {{cite web |url=http://cocatalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&PAGE=First |title=Public Catalog - Copyright Catalog (1978 to present) - Basic Search [search: \"Fantastic Journey\"] |publisher=United States Copyright Office |date= |accessdate=March 10, 2018}}</ref>\n |episodes=\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=1\n |Title=Atlantium\n |AltTitle=Pilot\", \"Vortex\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1977|2|3}}\n |ShortSummary=A party of scientists disappears into the Bermuda Triangle and becomes trapped on an island where past, present and future co-exist.

Front row: [[Ike Eisenmann]] and [[Jared Martin]] ]]\n'''''The Fantastic Journey''''' is an American [[science fiction]] television series that was originally aired on [[NBC]] from February 3 through June 16, 1977. Intended to run 13 episodes, as a [[mid-season replacement]], NBC cancelled the series in April, after the ninth episode aired. A tenth episode, already produced, was [[burning off|burned off]] two months later.\n\n== Premise ==\nThe series concerns a family and their associates who charter a boat out into the [[Caribbean]] for a scientific expedition.  After an encounter in the area of the [[Bermuda Triangle]] with an unnatural luminous green cloud accompanied by the eerie disembodied sound of [[ship's bells]], the group find themselves shipwrecked on a mysterious uncharted island from which they are unable to escape.\n[[File:Christina Hart Jared Martin The Fantastic Journey 1977.JPG|220px|thumb|[[Christina Hart]] as Gwenith, with Jared Martin as Varian, in \"An Act of Love\"]]\nThey encounter Varian ([[Jared Martin]]), initially disguised as an [[Arawak]] native, who is later revealed to be from the year 2230.  A 23rd-century pacifist, musician and healer, Varian explains to the travelers that, like he and many before them, they have been caught in a space/time continuum where people from the past, present, future and from other worlds are trapped, co-existing on the island in a series of \"Time Zones\".  The only way home can be found in a place called \"Evoland\", which lies \"far to the rising sun\".  (It was indicated in interviews of the time that Evoland was also the name of the island.) The only way to travel between Time Zones is via invisible gateways that instantaneously transport individuals or groups from one zone to another. In one episode \"Beyond The Mountain\" the group also encounters a second cloud, which has much the same effect, but which also splits up the group.\n\nAfter the [[television pilot|initial pilot]] story, a steady group of travelers forms around Varian as ''de facto'' leader, and the series then follows this group as they travel across the many Time Zones of the island to find Evoland. On their way, they encounter people from different planets and times who are also trapped on the island and who have adapted to their plight in different ways. The pilot initially suggested the historical past would be explored; however, the producers of the show rapidly adopted a consistently futuristic tone during the series following pressure from the network. They also dropped three characters after the pilot, as they wanted a more exotic group of travelers, hence the arrival of Liana and Willoway. Liana disappears from the last two episodes when Katie Saylor fell ill.\n\n==Cast==\n* Varian ([[Jared Martin]]): \"A man from the 23rd century possessing awesome powers\", Varian generally uses a kind of crystalline \"tuning fork\" device called the Sonic Energizer through which he focuses his thoughts into what is described as a sonic manipulation of matter.  The device is completely useless in anyone else's hands, and seems capable of a huge variety of tasks, from opening doors to disrupting electrical systems to large scale acts of destruction, as well as its apparently intended function as a diagnostic and healing device. Following the departure of Professor Paul Jordan at the end of the pilot film, Varian takes over as ''de facto'' leader to the travelers and adopts a parental role over Paul's teenage son, Scott (most notable in episodes such as \"An Act of Love\" and \"Turnabout\").\n* Scott Jordan ([[Ike Eisenmann]]): \"The 13-year-old son of a famous scientist\", Scott has an excellent knowledge of Earth history and events, but is still young and has much to learn.\n* Dr. Fred Walters ([[Carl Franklin]]): \"A young doctor just out of medical school\" whose impulsive and rather hot-headed nature acts as a counterpoint to the calm, pacifistic Varian.  A friend of Scott's father and the only other member of the group from the same time period, the athletic black physician takes the role of protective \"older brother\" with the young teen.\n* Liana ([[Katie Saylor]]): \"Daughter of an [[Atlantis|Atlantean]] father and an [[extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial]] mother\", the beautiful blonde Liana possessed greater than human physical strength (due to her mother being from a [[planet]] with a higher [[gravity]] than [[Earth]]) and powerful [[psychic phenomenon|psychic]] abilities (presumably due to her mixed heritage) which allow her to, among other things, [[telepathic|telepathically]] communicate with animals. Saylor left the show after the episode \"Turnabout\" due to illness. In the next episode \"Riddles\" the reason for her not being present with the group was given that she opted to stay a few days at Coriel to help the inhabitants work out their new government and would catch up with the group later.\n* Dr. Jonathan Willoway ([[Roddy McDowall]]): \"Rebel scientist from the 1960s\" who has a mastery of computers, robotics and scientific knowledge which is quite useful to the group. He is something of a never entirely trustworthy [[black sheep]], basically a cooler version of Doctor Smith from ''[[Lost in Space]]'' without the congenital cowardice, who often tends to do things for his own mysterious reasons. Over the course of the episodes, however, the black-clad Willoway comes to care about Scott and his fellow travelers and becomes more integrated into the group, although Fred makes no secret about still not trusting him which leads to a bickering [[Mr. Spock|Spock]]/[[Leonard McCoy|McCoy]]-style relationship between the two.\n* Sil-El (The Felix Team<ref>http://www.cult.tv/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=210:fantastic-journey&catid=37:series-formats&Itemid=27</ref>): Liana's companion and pet, a \"[[Bicolor cat|tuxedo cat]]\" with which she can communicate telepathically and who sometimes scouts ahead for her, acting as an extra set of eyes and ears.\n\n==Production==\n[[D. C. Fontana]] recalled that once the show had been commissioned, she and the producers had a very short period of time to develop and produce the show before filming commenced. Additional scenes were filmed and inserted into the pilot which introduces the Atlanteans who are the focus of Episode 2, but this new material also quickly moves off-screen the characters Paul, Eve and Jill (who were originally intended to be regulars), as the network wanted a more diverse group of travelers. Also, a subplot involving the travelers finding a 1940s Air Force pilot held prisoner by 16th century pirates was removed from the first episode.\n\nThe show benefited from a larger than normal amount of location filming, with familiar sites such as the Hollywood Hills, Zuma Beach, the Bonaventure Hotel in LA and Griffith Park Observatory all appearing in various episodes. The character Willoway was created specifically with [[Roddy McDowall]] in mind. Fortunately the actor was interested and took the role when approached.\n\nAlthough airing in a time when the nation's interest in the [[Bermuda Triangle]], [[UFO]]s and fantasy was at a height, the show failed to last beyond the ten episodes, having been scheduled as a mid-season replacement (following the failure of another fantasy series, ''[[Gemini Man (TV series)|Gemini Man]]'') against ''[[The Waltons]]'' and ''[[Welcome Back, Kotter]]'', both very popular family shows.

On March 25, 2006, a Wiki team was created by the \u2018Bangladesh Open Source Network\u2019 (BdOSN) to popularize Wikipedia throughout the country.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> The aim was to represent the country to the world through Wikipedia and build a complete encyclopedia in Bengali.\n\nAt that time, Bengali Wikipedia had only 500 articles. \u2018BdOSN wiki team\u2019 managed to spread the word through some newspapers and start a Bengali Wiki mailing list. Soon, many Bengali-speaking people from Bangladesh and abroad joined them in this dynamic project. As a result, by the end of the October, Bengali Wikipedia got to 10,000 articles.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Among the South Asian language Wikipedias, Bengali Wikipedia reached that milestone first, and many of these articles were illustrated with photos from the demonstrator of [[Bengali language movement|Bengali Language Movement]] Dr. Rafiqul Islam, who donated all his historical photographs taken during the language movement to [[Wikimedia Commons]].<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n{{Bengali Wikipedia article graph}}\nOne of the pioneer of the Bengali Wikipedia, Dr. Ragib Hasan said that {{quote|\u201cThe biggest challenge was writing something on internet in Bengali. The Bengali Unicode was not supported on most operating systems, only few websites on the internet supported Bengali Unicode, and users had difficulties configuring it. Moreover, the idea of writing something with Bengali Unicode was new. \u2026 in the beginning, the idea of a Wikipedia in Bengali was not actually workable.\u201d<ref name=\"auto1\"/>}}\n\nBetween 2009 and 2010, Bengali speakers from [[West Bengal]], India also started to contribute to Bengali Wikipedia.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> In the meantime, the [[Wikimedia Foundation]] started their operations and in October 3, 2011 a local chapter named [[Wikimedia Bangladesh]] was approved in Bangladesh<ref name=\"auto\"/> by the Foundation to promote educational content in Bengali.

It was officially standardized as the '''Tank, Combat, Full Tracked: 105-mm Gun, M60''' in March 1959.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page=165}} Although developed from the [[M48 Patton]], the M60 series was never ''officially'' classified as a member of the Patton tank family, but as a \"product-improved descendant\" of the Patton tank's design.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|pages= 6, 408 }} The United States fully committed to the [[Main Battle Tank]] doctrine in 1963 when the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] retired the last ([[M103 (heavy tank)|M103]]) heavy tank battalion. The M60 tank series became America's primary main battle tank during the [[Cold War]].{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 181 }} Over 15,000 M60s were built by Chrysler. Hull production ended in 1983, but 5,400 older models were converted to the M60A3 variant ending in 1990.<ref name=\"fas.org\" />\n\nIt reached operational capability with fielding to US Army units in Europe beginning in December 1960.<ref name=\"historyofwar.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/weapons_m60patton.html|title=M60 Patton Main Battle Tank (USA)|website=www.historyofwar.org}}</ref> The first combat usage of the M60 was with Israel during the 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]] where it saw service under the \"Magach 6\" designation, performing well in combat against comparable tanks such as the [[T-62]]. In 1982 the Israelis once again used the M60 during the [[1982 Lebanon War]], equipped with upgrades such as [[explosive reactive armor]] to defend against guided missiles that proved very effective at destroying tanks. The M60 also saw use in 1983 with [[United States invasion of Grenada|Operation Urgent Fury]], supporting US Marines in an amphibious assault into Grenada. M60s delivered to Iran also served in the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]]. The United States' largest deployment of M60s was in the 1991 [[Gulf War]], where the US Marines equipped with M60A1s effectively defeated Iraqi armored forces, including [[T-72|T-72M]] tanks. The United States readily retired the M60 after Operation Desert Storm, with the last units being retired from active service in 1997.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.militaryfactory.com/armor/detail.asp?armor_id=28|title=M60 (Patton) Main Battle Tank (MBT) - United States|website=www.militaryfactory.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-07}}</ref> M60-series vehicles continue in front-line service with a number of countries' militaries, though most of these have been highly modified and had their firepower, mobility and protection upgraded to increase their combat effectiveness on the modern battlefield.\n\nThe M60 underwent many updates over its service life. The interior layout, based on the design of the M48, provided ample room for updates and improvements, extending the vehicle's service life for over four decades. It was widely used by the US and its Cold War allies, especially those in [[NATO]], and remains in service throughout the world today, despite having been superseded by the [[M1 Abrams]] in the US military. The tank's hull also developed a wide variety of prototypical, utility and support vehicles such as armored recovery vehicles, bridge layers and combat engineering vehicles. As of 2015 [[Egypt]] is the largest operator with 1,716 upgraded M60A3s, [[Turkey]] is second with 866 upgraded units in service, and [[Saudi Arabia]] is third with over 650 units.\n\n==Development==\n===Impetus===\nThe United States entered a period of frenzied activity during the crisis atmosphere of the [[Korean War]], when America seemed to lag behind the Soviet Union in terms of tank quality and quantity.<ref name=\"benning.army.mil\">https://www.benning.army.mil/Armor/Historian/content/PDF/Armor%20Dev%20Cold%20War.pdf</ref> Testing and development cycles occurred simultaneously with production to ensure speedy delivery of new tanks. Such rapid production caused problems but the importance given to rapidly equipping combat units with new tanks precluded detailed testing and evaluation prior to quantity production.<ref name=\"benning.army.mil\"/>\n\nThe [[M47 Patton]] entered production in 1951 and was used by the United States Army and Marine Corps but ongoing technical and production problems kept it from serving in the Korean War. The [[M48 Patton]] tank entered US service in 1952 but its early designs were deemed unsatisfactory by Army Field Forces (AFF). The improvements to the M48 focused on improving the 90mm main gun and fire control systems while simultaneously exploring the development of silicas glass composite armor and autoloader systems. The tank continued further development through 1955 in conjunction with its simultaneous mass production. The course of its development during the mid 1950s was the source of widespread debate among Congressional Budget Oversight committees.\n\nThe [[T95 Medium Tank|T95 program]], which began in 1955 was intended to supersede the M48. It featured a host of innovative and experimental components such as its 90&nbsp;mm smoothbore T208 cannon rigidly affixed to its turret, experimental X-shaped engine design, composite armor and infrared rangefinder. The burden of developing them, however, slowed the overall program to a crawl. During the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, a Soviet [[T-54/T-55|T-54A]] medium tank was driven onto the grounds of the UK's embassy in Budapest by the Hungarians.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historynet.com/the-beast-of-budapest.htm |title=The Beast of Budapest |website=HistoryNet.com |date=19 July 2018 |access-date=1 June 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180921230135/http://www.historynet.com/the-beast-of-budapest.htm |archive-date=21 September 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> After a brief examination of this tank's armor by a British military attach\u00e9 it was concluded that the [[Ordnance QF 20-pounder|20-pounder (84mm L/66.7)]] was apparently incapable of defeating its frontal armor with HEAT or APC ammunition. Its 100mm main gun was a significant advancement over the weapon of the [[T-44]]. Also there were rumors of an even larger 115mm gun in the works. These events spurred the [[United Kingdom]] to develop a new tank gun in 1956, the [[Royal Ordnance L7]] to keep the [[Centurion (tank)|Centurion]] viable against this new Soviet tank design and the [[United States]] to develop the XM60 tank in 1957.<ref name=Halberstadt>{{Cite book |last=Halberstadt |first=Hans |title=Inside the Great Tanks |publisher=The Crowood Press |location=Wiltshire, England |year=1997 |pages=94\u201396 |isbn=1-86126-270-1 |oclc=40989477 |quote=The T-54/T-55 series is the hands down, all time most popular tank in history.}}</ref> This new tank design incorporated many Army Combat Vehicle (ARCOVE) committee improvements to the M48, chiefly the use of diesel engines to increase its operational range and the use of a more powerful main gun.\n\n===Choice of components===\n\n====M68 105 mm Main Gun====\nThe main gun was chosen after a comparative firing test of six different guns carried out on the Aberdeen Proving Grounds in 1958. The factors evaluated were accuracy, lethality of a hit, rate of fire and penetration performance.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|pages= 453\u2013454 }}\n\nAn M48A2C was fit with the 90&nbsp;mm M41 and tested with the new T300E53 HEAT round. A smoothbore version of the 90&nbsp;mm, the T208E9, was mounted on the T95E1 tank and tested the T320E62 APDS round. An American version of the British L7 105&nbsp;mm gun, under the name [[Royal Ordnance L7#United States|105&nbsp;mm T254E1]], was mounted on the T95E2 and tested with British APDS ammunition. Finally, two versions of the 120&nbsp;mm gun from the M103 were trialed, the existing M58 model and a lightened variant known as T123E6 which was mounted on the T95E4.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 155 }}\n\nThe T123E6 was preferred by the Ordnance Department because its ammunition, the same as that for the M58 gun, was already at an advanced state of development.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page=153 }} The ammunition was in two parts, shell and propellant bag, which required significant time to load. In the M103 this was addressed by adding a second loader, but a medium tank would not have the internal space needed for another crewmember and the firing rate would suffer as a result. In testing it demonstrated a maximum rate  of 4 rounds per minute vs. the T254's 7 rpm.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|pages= 453\u2013454 }}\n\nBased on these tests, the 105&nbsp;mm T254E1 was selected, modified to the T254E2 and standardized as the [[Royal Ordnance L7|Cannon, 105mm Gun, M68]]. It used a vertical sliding breechblock instead of the T254E1's horizontal breechblock. Until American-made barrels could be obtained with comparable accuracy, British X15/L52 barrels were to be used.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 155 }} US built XM24/L52 barrels (length 218.5 inches)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.williammaloney.com/Aviation/WatervlietArsenalMuseum/TankCannon/pages/09M68_105mmGun.htm|title=09 M68 105mm Gun|website=www.williammaloney.com|access-date=2019-05-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180121075334/http://www.williammaloney.com/Aviation/WatervlietArsenalMuseum/TankCannon/pages/09M68_105mmGun.htm|archive-date=2018-01-21|url-status=live}}</ref> fitted with an eccentric bore evacuator were used for the M60-series starting in June 1959 but retained interchangeability with the British X15/L52 barrel.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 152 }} All of the US guns and XM24 barrels were produced at the [[Watervliet Arsenal]], NY and the gun mounts (M116 for the M60 and M140 for the M60A1/A3) manufactured at the [[Rock Island Arsenal]], IL.<ref>https://www.gao.gov/assets/190/188401.pdf</ref> US M68 guns were fitted with an eccentric bore evacuator instead of a concentric model in order to provide more clearance over the rear deck.<ref name=\"Organizational Maintenance Manual--Tank 2306\">TM 9-2350-253-20-2 Organizational Maintenance Manual--Tank, Combat, Full Tracked: 105-mm Gun, M60A3 (2350-00-148-6548) and (2350-01-061-2306) TTS Turret.

It was in production from 1962 to 1983.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\">{{cite web |url=http://www.tanks-encyclopedia.com/coldwar/US/M60_Patton.php |title=105mm Gun Tank M60 |date=18 November 2014 |website=Tanks-encyclopedia.com |accessdate=12 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181018014014/http://www.tanks-encyclopedia.com/coldwar/US/M60_Patton.php |archive-date=18 October 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe M60-series went through a progressive turret design scheme during its production life with four different turrets being manufactured for the M60-series. The T95E5 turret used on the M60 was hemispherically shaped and bore a strong resemblance to the M48 Patton. The M60A1 was the first version to employ the newly designed T95E7 turret with a redesigned bustle increasing the number of rounds for the main gun to 63. The M60A2 featured a specially designed turret for the M162 gun/missile launcher that greatly reduced the frontal arc in comparison to the M60A1's T95E7 turret.  The M60A3's turret was similar to the A1's but with increased armor protection for the frontal arc and mantlet in an effort to provide additional protection of the turret's hydraulics system.\n\n====M19 Commander's Cupola====\nA redesigned full vision cupola was envisioned for the commander's station. It had 7 tiltable vision blocks arranged to give the commander a 360 degree field of view with overlapping vision between adjacent vision blocks. The front vision block could be replaced with a dual power M34 7x50 binocular day sight or an M19E1 IR periscope. A special feature was that the cupola body could be raised up to 3 1/2 inches providing the commander a direct field of vision while remaining under armor protection. Access was through a hatch cover on the roof and a .50 caliber M2HB machine gun was pedestal mounted on the forward part of the cupola. It could be aimed and fired with the cupola closed. Also there was an 11 inch long hydraulically operated port on the left side allowing spent cartridge cases to be ejected.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 156 }} After creating a full-sized mock up of this design using the [[T95 Medium Tank#Versions and modifications|T95E6 turret]], it was dropped in favor of a design based on the M1 cupola of the M48A2's turret. This T9 cupola provided the commander with more headroom than the T6 cupola of the T95 tank, carrying a new [[Receiver (firearms)|short receiver]] M85/T175 .50 caliber machine gun{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 156 }} and it was standardized as the Cupola, Tank Commander's Caliber .50 Machine Gun,<ref name=\"Direct Support 1975\" /> M19. The first M19 cupola (a modified T9) was ready on 27 October 1958. It has an M28C sight for the machine gun in the forward part of the cupola and eight vision blocks. The front vision block can be replaced by a M19E1 infrared periscope or an M36E1 passive periscope for night observation.<ref name=\"ReferenceE\">{{Cite web | url=http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/weapons_m60patton.html |title = M60 Patton Main Battle Tank (USA)}}</ref> Initial production of the cupola was problematic. The first 300 M60s produced were armed with a .50cal M2HB machine gun in a pedestal mount welded to the left side of the commander's cupola owing to production problems with the new M85 machine gun. Of these tanks, the first 45 manufactured were made without the cupola itself, also due to production problems.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Crismon, Fred W. U.S. Military Tracked Vehicles. Osceola, WI: Motorbooks International, 1992</ref> All of these early M60s eventually had the M19 cupola and M85 machine gun installed.\n\nCompared to a conventional pintle mount, the remote-controlled M85 machine gun was relatively ineffective in the anti-aircraft role for which it was designed. Removing the cupola lowered the vehicle's relatively high silhouette. The cupola's hatch also opened toward the rear of the vehicle and was dangerous to close if under small-arms fire owing to a lock-open mechanism that required the user to apply leverage to unlock it prior to closing. The commander was able to observe the battlefield using the binocular M34 vision block or M19E1 IR Periscope while remaining under armor protection with a 360 degree traverse independent of the turret,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.onwar.com/weapons/afv/data/usambtm60a3.htm |title=M60A3 Patton |website=onwar.com |access-date=2019-06-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180914203428/https://www.onwar.com/weapons/afv/data/usambtm60a3.htm |archive-date=2018-09-14 |url-status=live }}</ref> was stabilized in azimuth and elevation<ref name=\"50megs.com\">{{cite web|url=http://afvdb.50megs.com/usa/pics/m60.html|title=105mm Gun Tank M60|website=afvdb.50megs.com|access-date=2019-05-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190528154422/http://afvdb.50megs.com/usa/pics/m60.html|archive-date=2019-05-28|url-status=live}}</ref> and carried 600 rounds of ammunition.<ref name=\"onwar.com1\">{{cite web |url=https://www.onwar.com/weapons/afv/data/usambtm60.htm |title=M60 Patton |website=onwar.com |access-date=2019-04-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190426112135/https://www.onwar.com/weapons/afv/data/usambtm60.htm |archive-date=2019-04-26 |url-status=live }}</ref> All M60s in US service retained the M19 cupola until the tank was phased out of service. The few M60A3s in Army service as training vehicles had their commander's cupola removed as it was deemed unnecessary for training and to better mimic the profile of Soviet tanks. Some M48A5s were retrofitted with the M19 cupola to maintain training levels of National Guard units.\n\n====Main Battle Tank Designation====\nThe concept of the [[medium tank]] gradually evolved into the [[Main Battle Tank]] (MBT) in the 1960s. The MBT was to combine the firepower and protection sufficient for the assault role with the mobility to perform as a medium tank.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 149 }} The main battle tank thus took on the role the British had once called the \"universal tank\", exemplified by the [[Centurion (tank)|British Centurion]], filling almost all battlefield roles. Typical main battle tanks were as well armed as any other vehicle on the battlefield, highly mobile, and well armored. Yet they were cheap enough to be built in large numbers. The first generation consists of the medium tanks designed and produced directly after World War II that were later redefined as main battle tanks. These were exemplified by the [[M47 Patton|M47]] and [[M48 Patton]]s armed with  a 90mm main gun already in widespread US service. The original variant of the M60 series also fulfilled the definition of a late first generation MBT sometimes being referred to as an intermediate second generation design. The Soviet [[T-54/T-55|T-54 and T-55]] as well as the original configuration of the [[T-62|T-62A]] tank designs are also regarded as first generation MBTs. The second generation had enhanced night-fighting capabilities and in most cases NBC protection. Most western tanks of this generation were armed with the 105&nbsp;mm Royal Ordnance L7 tank gun or derivatives of it. Notable are the [[Chieftain (tank)|British Chieftain]] and [[Leopard 1|German Leopard 1]]. The United States fully committed to the main battle tank doctrine in 1963 when the Marine Corps deactivated its last [[M103 (heavy tank)|M103 Heavy Tank]] battalion.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1988|page= 327 }} The first American nomenclature-designated second generation MBT was the M60A1 version of the M60 series. The term MBT is used in strategic doctrine and the composition of force as determined by the United States Army. The M60 series tanks fulfilled the MBT role on a strategic and tactical level. It was never referred to as such in any official training or technical manuals. The first Soviet second generation main battle tank designs were the [[T-64]] and [[T-72]].<ref>\u0422\u0430\u043d\u043a \u0422-62. \u0420\u0443\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u043f\u043e \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0438 \u044d\u043a\u0441\u043f\u043b\u0443\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438. 1968</ref>\n\n===Production Versions===\n\n===XM60 Development===\nBy May 1957 it became clear that the [[T95 Medium Tank]] would not have a significant advantage over the [[M48A2]]. The X-shaped motor and electro-optical rangefinder were both discarded due to performance, and the accuracy of the smoothbore gun continued to be unsatisfactory. All this led to the closure of the T95 project on July 7, 1960. At the same time, work on the T95E7 turret was continued, which led to the creation of the fairly successful M60A1 turret.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 149 }} The course of the M48 Patton's tank production was the source of widespread Congressional debate. The [[Office of Management and Budget|Bureau of the Budget]] believed that the Army was not progressing with sufficient speed in its tank modernization program and recommended the immediate replacement of the M48A2. Correctly predicting that Congress would not approve the procurement of the M48A2 after the fiscal year 1959, the Deputy Chief of Staff, Logistics (DCSLOG) proposed a tank based on the M48A2 featuring improved firepower and the AVDS-1790 engine. Since the main gun had not yet been specified, four XM60 weapons systems were submitted in September 1957.\n\n[[File:XM60 120 big.png|thumb|left|Concept design #1 of the XM60 mounting the T123E6 main gun and British styled gun barrel, the newly designed full-vision cupola using the T95E6 turret as preferred by the Ordnance Department.]] \nThe first concept was armed with the 120mm gun T123E6 in the long nosed T95E6 turret. This was the design preferred by the Ordnance Department. It was fitted with a newly designed full-vision commander's cupola. A full sized mock-up of this turret was constructed before this concept was dropped, mainly due to its slow rate of fire. The second carried the 105mm rifled T254E2 main gun in the T95E5 type turret and the T9 cupola style of the M48A2. The T254 guns used British X15/L52 barrels with a concentric bore evacuator on the barrel.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 62 }} The Army Ordnance Technical Committee chose this design for production in August 1958. The third concept was to mount the 90mm T208 smooth-bore main gun and the T95E6 turret. It never progressed beyond design drawings. The fourth used the T95E1 turret and the T208 main gun. A mock-up was built using the new vision cupola. All of these conceptual designs were referred to as the XM60. A contract was awarded to Chrysler Engineering in September 1958 for the advanced production engineering (APE) of the XM60 concept #2.{{sfn|Lathrop|McDonald|2003|page= 47 }} The T95 hull was considered however its one-piece front casting was too difficult and expensive to produce in quantity. Some existing T95 hulls were re-fitted with the AVDS-1790 engine and used from 1960 to 1964 to develop the T118E1 prototyping of the [[M728 Combat Engineer Vehicle]].<ref>Tank Data, vol. 3. Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD: US Army Ordnance School, Jul 1968.</ref> Instead the decision was made to use modified M48A2 hulls. The hulls had 3 return rollers and 6 steel roadwheel pairs per side with no shock absorbers, using only bumper springs on the first and sixth roadwheel arms, along with a widened turret well and ring, and a flat wedge-shaped glacis. The T254E2 gun was chosen to be the main weapon of the tank in August 1958 being standardized as the M68 105mm gun. After a briefing on 11 December 1958, [[Maxwell D. Taylor|General Maxwell Taylor]] ordered the XM60 into production because of the improvements it offered in firepower, protection, and cruising range.{{sfn|Lathrop|McDonald|2003|page= 47 }}  Since the tank had not yet received its official designation these prototype hulls were briefly referred to as the M68 in December 1958 until they were officially named the M60 in March 1959.<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com3\" /> Fulfilling this requirement was an interim tank design that resulted in the M60-series,{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 152 }} which largely resembles the M48 it was based on, but has significant differences.\n\n===M60===\n[[File:M60 Pilot 1.jpg|thumb|M60 production pilot number 1 after completion by Chrysler on 2 July 1959.

Production pilot 2 was finished on 4 August and used to develop technical publications and an additional 47 tanks produced to complete the first low rate production buy. In August 1959, an engineering bid package was awarded for the second low rate production buy of M60s to be built at the Delaware Plant. Production pilot 3 was completed 2 September and went to the Detroit Arsenal Test Center for maintenance evaluations, it was then sent to Fort Knox for user trials. The fourth pilot was completed on 26 October  and was used as the master hull to verify production standards at the Detroit Tank Plant with a low-rate initial production total of 180 M60s built in 1959.<ref name=\"ReferenceE\"/> Subsequent production, starting with the October 1960 batch were built at the [[Detroit Arsenal (Warren, Michigan)|Detroit Arsenal Tank Plant]], in Warren Michigan. It reached operational capability with fielding to Army units in Europe beginning in December 1960.<ref name=\"historyofwar.org\"/> \n;Features\nThe original variant of the M60 series ultimately was produced as a quick fix engineering (QFE) upgrade of the M48 due to the Soviet Union's tank advancements of the late 1950s and the delays from developing the silicas armor and an improved turret design. The M60 mounted a 105&nbsp;mm M68 main gun with the [[bore evacuator]] mounted towards the middle of the tube carrying 57 rounds in the clamshell shaped turret style of the M48. Nine rounds were stowed in the left side of the turret bustle behind the loader.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://afvdb.50megs.com/usa/pics/m48patton.html |title=90mm Gun Tank M48 Patton 48 |website=afvdb.50megs.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190424102744/http://afvdb.50megs.com/usa/pics/m48patton.html |archive-date=2019-04-24 |url-status=live }}</ref> The remaining rounds were stored inside safe containers on the hull floor.<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com3\"/> A new short receiver coaxial machine gun was designed for the M60 tank. This was the 7.62mm M73/T197E2 which replaced the .30 caliber M37 used on the M48A2. It had 2,000 rounds of ammunition.<ref name=\"onwar.com1\"/> They had a reputation for jamming.

The ballistic computer is a mechanically driven unit that permits ammunition selection, range correction, and superelevation correction by the gunner. The ballistic drive receives the range input and, through the use of cams and gears, provides superelevation information to the superelevation actuator. The superelevation actuator adds sufficient hydraulic fluid to the elevating mechanism to correctly position the gun.<ref name=\"dtic.mil\"/>\n\nIn late 1962 a kit was fielded that allowed the use of the AN/VSS-1(V)1 IR searchlight. The searchlight has both infrared and visible light capabilities and was positioned over the gun. Along with an M32 IR periscope for the gunner, M19 IR periscope and M18 IR binoculars for the commander provided [[Night-vision device#Generation 1|first generation night vision]] capability to the M60 and M60A1 tanks. This kit was also compatible with the M48A5.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|pages= 166\u2013167 }}\n\nThe hull bottom had a strong boat-like appearance with a pronounced recess between the upper tracks and external suspension arms with cast aluminum roadwheels and return rollers along with a single shock absorber on the first roadwheel pair. Cast aluminum road wheels were used to save weight. The armor was improved, at 6 inches (155&nbsp;mm) on the front glacis and mantle of solid rolled homogeneous armor, while it was 4.3 inches (110&nbsp;mm) on the M48.  Power was provided by the AVDS-1790-2A engine, CD-850-5 cross drive transmission and the T97E2 track assembly as used on the M48A3.<ref>afvdb.50megs.com/usa/m48patton.html</ref> The drive sprocket is located at the rear of the hull. The vehicle also provides full NBC protection for the crew using the M13A1 protection system creating a positive atmospheric pressure in the crew compartment. The positive pressure keeps contaminated air out and forces the smoke produced from firing the main or coax guns out of the vehicle. Access between the driver's compartment and the turret fighting compartment was also restricted, requiring that the turret be traversed to the rear.\n\nThe M60 was deployed to [[West Germany]] to counter the threat presented from the [[T-54]]s and [[T-55]]s of the Soviet Union and [[Warsaw Pact]] as well as to South Korea but was never sent to [[Republic of Vietnam|South Vietnam]] mainly due to unfavorable terrain and the general lack of significant numbers of North Vietnamese armor.

In that time span numerous product improvement programs were put forward. As the major changes were incorporated into the production line, the vehicle model designations were changed. The first of which was Top Loading Air Cleaner (TLAC) in 1971. This reduced dirt and dust ingestion, which increased engine life as well as easier servicing of the engine.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 199 }} Early TLAC panels were made from aluminum and were vulnerable to damage from small arms fire.<ref name=\"dtic.mil\"/> Next came Add-On Stabilization (AOS) that was introduced in late 1972.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 199 }} This was an add-on kit made to fit with minimum modifications to the existing hydraulic gun control system. The add-on-stabilization system provides stabilization control for both gun elevation and turret traverse. It provides the gunner with the capability of aiming and target tracking and also improved surveillance of the battlefield terrain by the gunner while the tank is moving.<ref name=\"dtic.mil\"/> It may be used in any one of three modes of control: (1) power-with-stabilization-on, (2) power-with-stabilization-off, and (3) manual. In the power-with-stabilization-on mode, the gunner's aim on target is automatically retained while the vehicle is in motion. This mode provides a fire-on the-move capability. The power-with-stabilization-off option eliminates needless exercise of the stabilization system and provides a back up power mode. The manual back up system permits the crew to aim and fire the weapons should the electrical/hydraulical subsystems fail.<ref name=\"dtic.mil\"/> At a range of 2000 meters, hit probabilities of better than 70% from a moving M60A1 were obtained in Aberdeen<ref name=\"dtic.mil\"/> test results while without a stabilizer it was essentially zero. M60A1s with this upgrade were denoted as the M60A1(AOS). The T142 track was fielded in 1974 which had replaceable rubber pads, better end connecters and improved service life.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 200 }} M60A1(AOS)+ was the denotation for M60A1s equipped with the TLAC, AOS and the T142 track.<ref name=\"dtic.mil\"/>\n\nIntroduced in 1975 the Reliability Improved Selected Equipment (RISE) was a comprehensive upgrade of the M60A1 hull as well as integrating the previous TLAC and AOS upgrades. It included the upgraded [[Continental AV1790|AVDS-1790-2C RISE diesel engine]] and CD-850-6 transmission that featured several changes in order to improve service life and reliability. A new 650 ampere oil cooled alternator, a solid state regulator and new wiring harness with more accessible disconnectors was also incorporated into the hull's electrical system{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 200 }} as well as armored steel TLAC panels and the return to the use of steel roadwheels and return rollers. They were denoted as M60A1(RISE).<ref name=\"dtic.mil\"/> The 1977 fielding of the passive M32E1 sight for the gunner and M36E1 periscope for the commander as well as the M24E1 IR night vision block for the driver provided [[Night-vision device#Generation 2 (GEN II)|second generation night vision]] capabilities for M60A1 and RISE tanks. These new passive gunner's sight and commander's periscope provide recognition capability at longer ranges and at relatively low night light levels (1/2 moonlight). Under starlight conditions, they will provide recognition beyond 500 meters with the use of an IR searchlight.<ref name=\"dtic.mil\"/> During 1978 a kit for the mounting of the M240 as the coaxial machine gun was fielded.  The development of the M735 [[Armour-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot|APFSDS]] ammunition required a cam update to the gun's mechanical ballistic drive for accurate firing. M60A1s configured to this standard were denoted as M60A1(RISE)+.\n[[File:US Army M551 Sheridan German village.jpg|thumb|A US Army M60A1 RISE Passive tank maneuvers through a narrow German village street while participating in [[Exercise REFORGER|REFORGER]] 1982.]]\nThe M60A1(RISE) Passive featured the implementation of all previous updates plus Kevlar spall liners for the turret, AN/VVS-2 passive night vision block for the driver, a deep water fording kit, the capability to mount Explosive Reactive Armor (ERA){{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 202 }}{{sfn|Lathrop|McDonald|2003|page= 56 }} and the AVDS-1790-2D RISE engine with CD-850-6A transmission and a Vehicle Engine Exhaust Smoke System (VEESS) that visually obscured the area around the vehicle. The VEESS smokescreen system does not provide protection against infrared, thermal or laser detection. The two six-barreled, electronically fired M239 smoke grenade launchers, one on each side of the main gun and replacement of the coax machine gun with the M240C were implemented in late 1978. The smoke grenades contains a phosphors compound that masks the thermal signature of the vehicle to the enemy.  They were denoted as M60A1(RISE) Passive.<ref name=\"dtic.mil\"/>\n\nOver the period of M60A1 tank production several essential engineering changes were incorporated. Many of these miscellaneous changes are to improve the system safety, reliability, maintainability and increase mission performance. The M60A1 tank Hull/Turret PIP Update Kit includes those items that could not be readily identified with basic major product improvements and to incorporate essential engineering changes that had occurred during M60A1 tank production. The update program included engineering changes and minor product improvements which were not part of specific product improvements, but were required to upgrade early vintage M60A1 tanks up to the current M60A1(RISE) Passive production configuration.<ref name=\"dtic.mil\"/>\n\nThe M60A1 was in production from October 1962 until May 1980<ref name=\"historyofwar.org\"/> and was extensively used by the US Army and Marine Corps as well as being widely exported to foreign governments. A total of 7,948 M60A1s (all variants including E60A) were built.{{sfn|Lathrop|McDonald|2003|page= 327 }} Many of them were later converted to the A3 standard.\n\n===M60A2{{anchor|M60A2}}===\nDuring the early 1960s there was some debate regarding the future of main tank weaponry, largely focusing on conventional kinetic energy rounds versus missiles. In the early 1960s it was generally accepted that the maximum effective range of the M68 gun was between 1800 and 2000 meters. The XM-13 missile system had proven itself viable, obtaining over 90% first round accuracy up to 4000 meters. But the development of a main-battle tank variant was bogged down by having too many design proposals. In response, studies were made in August 1961 to retrofit existing M60 tanks with a weapon capable of firing both conventional HEAT (High-Explosive Anti-Tank) rounds and launching ATGMs (Anti-Tank Guided-Missiles).<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com4\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tanks-encyclopedia.com/coldwar/US/medium-tank-m60a2-starship/|title=152mm Gun/Launcher M60A2 'Starship'|date=7 July 2017|website=Tank Encyclopedia}}</ref> Three M60E1 tanks with T95 turrets were modified to permit the installation of the 152mm XM81 gun-launcher. Mounted on former M60 hulls, they were to provide test beds for the evaluation of the Shillelagh weapon system. Although this system was the preferred armament for the MBT-70, by late 1961 problems with the XM13 missile required that the program be reorganized. The missile was reclassified as an applied research project and it was obvious that there would be some delay before it would be available for service.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 627 }} On 10 January 1962, representatives from various ordnance organizations met at the Ordnance Tank-Automotive Center (OTAC) to review armament systems that might be suitable replacements, if the Shillelagh missile could not be developed in a timely manner. Time was particularly critical for the AR/AAV (the XM551 Sheridan) which required a decision on the armament by April 1962. The possible delay was not as serious for the MBT-70 since the program was limited to conceptual design and component development. The requirements also differed for the tank because of its ability to carry a much heavier weapon system. Several backup weapons were also under consideration and concept studies were prepared showing their application to the MBT-70 concepts. The 152mm gun-launcher XM81 also was considered without the missile depending only on the combustible case conventional ammunition. It was expected that the Shillelagh or some other missile then could be introduced at a later date. The 105mm gun M68 as standardized for the M60 tank was considered as an alternate armament system. It had the advantage of being immediately available and its ammunition was already in production. Of the several turrets drafted, one of the earliest was the driver-in-turret integrated fighting compartment. This design was further developed using the [[MBT-70]]. Another proposal was a more compact turret design of the T95E7.<ref>Hunnicutt, R.P. Patton: A History of the American Main Battle Tank, volume 1. Navato, CA: Presidio Press, 1984 pp.631-633</ref>\n\n;Development\n[[File:XM66 Type C design concept.png|thumb|Conceptual drawing of the XM66 with Type C turret]]\nDuring the development of the M60A2, three different turret types were considered, the Type A, Type B and Type C. The Type A turret would be constructed based on the T95E7 turret and then further modified and produced as the Type B standard. The Type C turret was essentially a larger [[M551 Sheridan]]-style turret. A mock-up of this turret was built, but the design was never seriously considered and soon abandoned. All of these conceptual variants were referred to as the XM66. On 10 January 1964, the Army reviewed all three variants and selected the Type A variant for further development. Initially two Type A turrets were built in 1964.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 138 }} The M60A1 hull was used starting in 1966 to develop the new compact turret design using the 152mm M162/XM81E13 rifled barrel main gun. These developmental tanks were designated as the M60A1E series.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 141 }}\n\nThe M60A1E1 referred to vehicles based on the modified T95E7 Type A turrets with M60 hulls used through 1965. The M60A1E1 variant was used to evaluate the M162/XM81E13 gun on different mounts and compatibility with the XM13 Guided Missile, Armor Defeating together with the XMTM51 training round. They used a modified M60A1/T95E7 turret. During the early testing of the M162/XM81E13 main gun it was noted that misfires and premature detonations of the M409 conventional case ammunition were caused by unburnt propellant in the bore and breech. This flaw was often catastrophic as it set off the projectile in the barrel as it was fired.<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.tanks-encyclopedia.com/coldwar/US/medium-tank-m60a2-starship/ |title=152mm Gun/Launcher M60A2 'Starship' |date=7 July 2017 |access-date=1 June 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190327085943/http://www.tanks-encyclopedia.com/coldwar/US/medium-tank-m60a2-starship/ |archive-date=27 March 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> To remedy this the guns were equipped with a traditional fume extractor on the barrel.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= }} The XM81E13 Gun/Launcher also experienced frequent faulty breaches, often not closing correctly during a missile firing, allowing the exhaust of the launching Shillelagh to vent hot noxious gasses into the crew compartment.<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com4\"/> [[File:M60A1E1 Tank.jpg|thumb|left|M60A1E2 tank prototype with Type B turret.]] As the M60A1 hull became available in 1966, it was decided to upgrade these prototype vehicles to the M60A1 standard. Vehicles using the M60A1 hull and chassis received the M60A1E2 designation, and were used to develop the Type B compact turret.<ref>Sabot Publications, M60A2 Main Battle Tank in Detail, Volume 1/</ref> The M60A1E2 finalized the turret design with the use of a compact turret which reduced exposed frontal area by 40% compared to the M60A1 and continued development of the M51 Missile Guidance System (M51MGS).<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com2\"/> These were later standardized as the M60A2. Initial plans called to retrofit the turret of every M60 with the new A2 turret, and use them in the mobile anti-armor role  alongside the M60A1 tanks. But the continual technical and reliability difficulties with the dual purpose gun caused this to be abandoned. The M60A1E3 variant was a prototype mounting the M68 105&nbsp;mm rifled gun to the turret of the M60A1E2. This was evaluated due to several earlier faults noted in the M60A1E1's main gun. Compared to the Shillelagh system, the use of the 105mm gun increased the overall tank weight by about 1700 pounds.<ref>Hunnicutt, R.P. Patton: A History of the American Main Battle Tank, volume 1. Navato, CA: Presidio Press, 1984 p.632</ref> The M60A1E4 was a conceptual variant that explored the use of various remote controlled weapons, including a 20mm gun as secondary armament. A mock-up of this design using the Type C turret was constructed.

It consisted of a large disk with a narrow channel in the center with each crew member in the turret having their own hatch. The gunner and loader were located to the right and left of the gun, respectively, and the commander was in a turret basket up and behind the main gun. As a result, each crew member was effectively isolated from one another with the gunner and loader separated by Shillelagh missiles in their storage position. The commander was in the rear compartment under a large redesigned cupola, which somewhat negated the low profile silhouette of the turret.<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com4\"/> The M162 gun was fully stabilized in both turret traverse and gun elevation using the same upgrade kit as the M60A1 AOS. This system could be used by the gunner to engage targets with unguided M409 rounds while the vehicle was in motion, but the tank had to remain stationary when firing and tracking an MGM-51 missile.<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com4\"/> The turret interior also received Kevlar spall liners. Four M226 smoke grenade launchers were mounted on each side of the turret bustle.<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com2\"/> Additionally  there was a mounting point to the left of the turret for an AN/VSS-1(V)1 Infrared Spotlight and M19E1 IR periscope providing [[Night-vision device#Generation 1|first generation night vision]] for night operations. A basket was fitted to the rear of the turret to stow the spotlight when not in use. Late production versions replaced the bore evacuator with the Closed-Bore Scavenger System (CBSS), a compressed air system that pushed the fumes and gasses out of the muzzle when the breach was opened.<ref name=\"auto5\"/> Initial production M60A2s used the M60A1 hull powered by an AVDS-1790-2A TLAC engine, CD-850-5 cross-drive transmission and the T97 track assembly.

After acquiring a target a small charge would propel the missile out of the barrel, the missile's solid-fueled sustainer rocket then ignited and launched the Shillelagh. For the time of flight of the missile, the gunner had to keep the cross-hairs pointed at the target. A direct infrared beam  missile tracker in the gunner's sight detected any deviation of the flight path from the line-of-sight to the target, and transmitted corrective commands to the missile via an infrared command link. The MGM-51A was stabilized by flip-out fins, and controlled by hot gas jet reaction controls.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.designation-systems.net/dusrm/m-51.html|title=Ford MGM-51 Shillelagh|website=www.designation-systems.net}}</ref> The gunner also employed an [[M73 Machine gun|M73]] (later replaced with a [[M240 machine gun|M240C]]) to the gun mantle's right with 2,000 rounds.<ref>Sabot Publications, M60A2 Main Battle Tank in Detail, Volume</ref> The commanders cupola was redesigned causing the [[M85 machine gun|M85]] to be mounted in the inverted position in order to provide access to its feed cover and mounted a single M34 periscope carrying 600 rounds.<ref name=\"auto5\">Sabot Publications, M60A2 Main Battle Tank in Detail, Volume 2</ref> The M60A2's combat load for the M162 main gun consisted of 33 M409 rounds and 13 [[MGM-51 Shillelagh]] missiles.<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com2\"/>\n\n;Flaws\nThis weapon system had several drawbacks. First the gunner had to keep the target in the crosshairs of the sight during the entire flight time of the missile.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://history.redstone.army.mil/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2019-06-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190109174232/https://history.redstone.army.mil/ |archive-date=2019-01-09 |url-status=live }}</ref> This meant that only one target could be tracked and engaged at a time. Furthermore, the M60A2 could not fire or track a missile while moving.<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com2\"/> Secondly was the high minimum range of about 730&nbsp;m (2,400&nbsp;ft). Until the missile reached this range it flew beneath the tracking system's infrared beam and could therefore not be guided by the infrared command link. Also minimum range was slightly above the maximum effective range of the M60A2's conventional unguided munition, this created a dangerous gap area that could not be adequately covered by fire known as a \"dead zone\". It was also discovered that structural cracks in the barrel occurred after several missile firings. This defect was traced to a flaw in the longitudinal key, which fitted into a keyway inside the gun barrel. It was determined that a less deep key would significantly extend the service life of the barrel. The Missile Control System was also very fragile owing to its dependence on vacuum tubes which often broke when firing the gun.  Finally a Shillelagh missile was considerably more expensive than the M409 round. The vehicle was one of the most technologically complex of its era, eventually garnering an unofficial nickname of \"Starship\".<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com2\"/> This also contributed to its failure, largely due to difficulties with maintenance, training, and complicated operation.\n\nThe M60A2 proved a disappointment, though its technical advancements would pave the way for future tanks. Its intended successor, the [[MBT-70]], was canceled in 1971 and its funding diverted into the [[History of the M1 Abrams#Development|conceptual development of the XM1 Abrams]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ground/mbt-70.htm |title = MBT-70 / Xm803}}</ref> The Shillelagh/M60A2 system was phased out from active units by 1981, and the turrets scrapped.

These were essentially M60s with minor modifications requested by approved foreign purchasers.  Some of the modifications included removal of the M19 cupola, different models of machine guns, electronics, fire control systems or radios, external armor plates, smoke launchers and power packs.<ref>https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a528585.pdf</ref> Israel purchased many of these tanks forming the basis for the [[Magach#Versions|Magach 6]] series.\n\nThis series included the following designations:\n*E60: modified M60 variant for non-US service\n*E60A: modified M60A1 variant for non-US service\n*E60B: modified M60A3 variant for non-US service\n\nThe M60A2 was never approved for foreign sales.\n\n===Foreign upgrades===\nA [[United States Congress|US Congressional Report]] in November 1993 stated that there were 5,522 serviceable M60A1 and M60A3 tanks in the US Army's inventory available for sale or transfer to US allies or foreign nations. Of these 111 were in [[South Korea|Korea]], 1,435 were in [[Europe]], and 3,976 located in the continental US (CONUS). The average age of these tanks was 16 years and an expected peacetime service life of 20 years. The average price was US$212,898 per tank without radios or machine guns and they were not overhauled. Tanks located in Korea were inspected and sold to [[Bahrain]] and [[Taiwan]]. Of the 1,435 tanks in Europe, 1,311 have been cascaded to other NATO countries under the terms of the [[Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe|Conventional Forces Europe Agreement]] (CFE), 18 reserved for non-combat use and 106 returned to CONUS. Egypt inspected 411 tanks at Fort Hood and 91 at Fort Knox and tentatively selected 299 of those. An additional inventory of tanks from the CONUS M60 fleet were available at the same unit price for other approved purchasers.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/land/docs/h931124-m60a3.htm |title=Taiwan \u2013 Congressional Record |website=Fas.org |accessdate=2018-11-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417061229/http://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/land/docs/h931124-m60a3.htm |archive-date=2016-04-17 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe United States chose not to pursue further upgrades to the M60 tank series after 1979 because of its near-term replacement by the Army with the production of the M1 Abrams starting in 1980. M60 series tanks were phased out of US service by 1997 and [[Opposing Force|OPFOR(S)]] training use in 2005. Together with the large number of M60MBTs still in foreign service and a large US Army surplus inventory, several upgrades for the tank were offered starting in 1985. There are three basic approaches to upgrade decisions for the M60MBT. Some countries, such as Taiwan and Jordan, have sought to modernize the M60 as a frontline main battle tank. Turkey is seeking a middle-ground, keeping it useful as it develops more modern designs. Other countries, such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Thailand are modernizing their M60 fleets for counterinsurgency-type operations. While the market for M60 modernization is somewhat limited, because the tank is generally operated by poorer countries or has been relegated to secondary tasks, other companies have come up with more advanced upgrade solutions. Additionally, several countries also funded their own design upgrades, notable examples are the [[Magach]], [[Sabra (tank)|Sabra]] and Phoenix variants. In 2005, M60 variants were in service with [[Military of Egypt|Egypt]], [[Military of Greece|Greece]], [[Israel Defense Forces|Israel]], [[Royal Jordanian Army|Jordan]], [[Turkish Army|Turkey]], [[Republic of China Army|Taiwan]] and some 20 other nations to varying degrees.\n\n====Super M60/AX====\n[[File:Super-m60.jpg|thumb|right|General Dynamics Super M60/AX prototype, 1985]]The Super M60/AX, also called ''Super 60'', was a comprehensive update package for the M60A1 and A3 tanks, first offered in 1985 by General Dynamics. The vehicle was developed as a private venture for the export market and was never evaluated for US military service. The upgrade offered to increase the protection, firepower and mobility for the M60A1 and A3 tanks.\n\nAlthough the US Army chose not to pursue the installation of a new power pack or suspension system in the M60 series, General Dynamics formed a co-operative private venture with Telledyne Continental to develop an upgrade. The new engine and suspension not only smoothen the off-road ride, but also allowed the M60/AX to handle well in spite of its considerable weight increase over the original M60A1. After initial tests, additional modifications were applied, featuring an armor upgrade intended to increase protection from shaped charged projectiles.<ref>http://www.military-today.com/tanks/super_m60.htm</ref> It was referred to as the Super 60 Program.\n\nThe tank upgrade is based on the M60A1 RISE hull and the T95E7 turret as used on the M60A1 and A3 variants of the M60 series. Mobility was increased by 20% with a new engine and transmission. It featured the AVCR-1790-1B engine coupled to a Renk RK-304 transmission with 4 forward and 4 reverse gears. The torsion bar suspension system of the M60 was replaced with the National Waterlift hydropneumatic suspension system (HSS).{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1988|pages=  }} Survivability was enhanced with a layer of Chobham spaced [[Vehicle armour#Appliqu\u00e9|applique armor]] built around the M60A1 turret, that noticeably changed its appearance. The hull armor is enhanced with a layer of laminated [[Vehicle armour#Steel|steel armor panels]] covering the frontal arc of the hull. A pair of steel track skirts were added as well as Kevlar spall liners for the fighting compartment. It has a crew of 4, the commander, loader and gunner are positioned in the turret and the driver in the front of the hull.\n[[File:Magach-7-latrun-2.jpg|left|thumb|Magach 7C in Yad la-Shiryon museum, Latrun.]]\nThe weapons of the M60/AX are similar to those of the M60A3, but different models were used. The main gun is the rifled 105&nbsp;mm/L55 M68A1E2 with a longer XM24 tube and a thermal sleeve, the same weapon used on the M1 and M1IP versions of the [[M1 Abrams]] MBT with 43 rounds.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tanknutdave.com/the-us-super-m60-tank-upgrade-package/|title=The US Super M60 Tank Upgrade Package}}</ref>  The 7.62&nbsp;mm M73 coaxial machine gun used on the M60A1 is replaced with a 7.62&nbsp;mm M240C, with the same number of rounds. The M19 cupola was replaced with a low silhouette model with a pop-up hatch for the commander and a 12.7&nbsp;mm [[M2 Browning|M2HB]] machine gun on a pintle mount with 600 rounds. The Fire Control System (FCS) is essentially the same as used on the M60A3TTS consisting of an M21E1 solid-state ballistic computer, Raytheon AN/VSG2 Tank Thermal Sight (TTS) for the gunner, a Raytheon AN/VVS2 flash-lamp pumped ruby-laser based range finder, accurate up to 5000 meters, an M10A2E3 electro-mechanical ballistic drive and solid-state analog data card bus.  The [[prototype]] built did not have an optical range finder but one could have been easily installed.\n\nAs one of the first upgrade packages offered for the M60 series, the M60/AX prototype demonstrated the potential for upgrading the M60A1/A3 and even the M48 series as well. Even though this update package offered M60 users an opportunity to dramatically increase the combat capabilities of their tank fleets, no country ever bought the update, and the program effectively ceased by the end of the [[Cold War]]. Only one [[prototype]] was built. The overall failure of the Super 60 Program was likely due to the lack of immediate necessity for such a vehicle.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.military-today.com/tanks/super_m60.htm |title=Super M60 Prototype Main Battle Tank |website=Military-today.com |access-date=2019-06-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190520231703/http://www.military-today.com/tanks/super_m60.htm |archive-date=2019-05-20 |url-status=live }}</ref> This design was also developed independently by Israel in their [[Magach#Versions|Magach 7]] series.\n\n====M60-2000 Main Battle Tank====\n{{main|M60-2000 Main Battle Tank}}\n[[File:M60-1220S.png|thumb|right|M60-120S]]\nThe [[General Dynamics Land Systems]] (GDLS) M60-2000 or 120S was an upgrade of the M60A1 tank. The development of the M60-2000 was primarily due to the large number of M60 Main Battle Tanks in service with many Middle Eastern nations unable to afford a sufficient force of more modern main battle tanks. The upgrade was marketed at those M60 users with the industrial capability to convert the tanks themselves. The M60-2000/120S was a GDLS supplied conversion kit that married the M1A1 turret of the [[M1 Abrams]] to the M60A1 RISE hull, offering many features of the M1A1 Abrams to existing M60 users at a reduced cost.\n\nIt was first referred to the M60-2000 Program and design work began in late 1999 by General Dynamics Land Systems as a private venture for the export market and was never evaluated for US military service. Later the M60 designation was dropped because of the extensive changes and to highlight this as a new vehicle to potential customers thus changing the name to the 120S Project. The M60-2000 was test-marketed during 2000 and a number of countries in NATO and the Middle East were briefed on the vehicle. Following customer feedback, detailed engineering work was carried out and in December GDLS decided to build a functional prototype.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ground/m60-2000.htm |title = M60-2000 / 120S Main Battle Tank}}</ref> In August 2001 the company rolled out the fully functional prototype of the 120S MBT at their Detroit, Michigan, facility. The prototype was shown at the IDEF Exhibition held in Turkey in October 2001.\n\nThe 120S was initially aimed at the Turkish Land Forces Command (TLFC) M60 upgrade requirement but this competition was subsequently won by [[Israel Military Industries|IMI Military Industries]] with their [[Sabra (tank)|Sabra II]] upgrade. The [[Egyptian Army]] was considering this offer until it was finally rejected in favor of a licensed contract to build M1s in Egypt.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.dsca.mil/major-arms-sales/egypt-co-production-m1a1-abrams-tank |title = Egypt - Co-production of M1A1 Abrams Tank &#124; the Official Home of the Defense Security Cooperation Agency}}</ref> Only one prototype was made.

Except for a small number in [[TRADOC]] service for the combat training of units in Europe, most M60s were placed in reserve. Some 1,400 were transferred to NATO allies from 1991 to 1993 under the [[Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe]] and some were sold, mainly to Middle Eastern countries.

It was officially standardized as the '''Tank, Combat, Full Tracked: 105-mm Gun, M60''' in March 1959.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page=165}} Although developed from the [[M48 Patton]], the M60 series was never ''officially'' classified as a member of the Patton tank family, but as a \"product-improved descendant\" of the Patton tank's design.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|pages= 6, 408 }} The United States fully committed to the [[Main Battle Tank]] doctrine in 1963 when the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] retired the last ([[M103 (heavy tank)|M103]]) heavy tank battalion. The M60 tank series became America's primary main battle tank during the [[Cold War]].{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 181 }} Over 15,000 M60s were built by Chrysler. Hull production ended in 1983, but 5,400 older models were converted to the M60A3 variant ending in 1990.<ref name=\"fas.org\" />\n\nIt reached operational capability with fielding to US Army units in Europe beginning in December 1960.<ref name=\"historyofwar.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/weapons_m60patton.html|title=M60 Patton Main Battle Tank (USA)|website=www.historyofwar.org}}</ref> The first combat usage of the M60 was with Israel during the 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]] where it saw service under the \"Magach 6\" designation, performing well in combat against comparable tanks such as the [[T-62]]. In 1982 the Israelis once again used the M60 during the [[1982 Lebanon War]], equipped with upgrades such as [[explosive reactive armor]] to defend against guided missiles that proved very effective at destroying tanks. The M60 also saw use in 1983 with [[United States invasion of Grenada|Operation Urgent Fury]], supporting US Marines in an amphibious assault into Grenada. M60s delivered to Iran also served in the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]]. The United States' largest deployment of M60s was in the 1991 [[Gulf War]], where the US Marines equipped with M60A1s effectively defeated Iraqi armored forces, including [[T-72|T-72M]] tanks. The United States readily retired the M60 after Operation Desert Storm, with the last units being retired from active service in 1997.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.militaryfactory.com/armor/detail.asp?armor_id=28|title=M60 (Patton) Main Battle Tank (MBT) - United States|website=www.militaryfactory.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-07}}</ref> M60-series vehicles continue in front-line service with a number of countries' militaries, though most of these have been highly modified and had their firepower, mobility and protection upgraded to increase their combat effectiveness on the modern battlefield.\n\nThe M60 underwent many updates over its service life. The interior layout, based on the design of the M48, provided ample room for updates and improvements, extending the vehicle's service life for over four decades. It was widely used by the US and its Cold War allies, especially those in [[NATO]], and remains in service throughout the world today, despite having been superseded by the [[M1 Abrams]] in the US military. The tank's hull also developed a wide variety of prototypical, utility and support vehicles such as armored recovery vehicles, bridge layers and combat engineering vehicles. As of 2015 [[Egypt]] is the largest operator with 1,716 upgraded M60A3s, [[Turkey]] is second with 866 upgraded units in service, and [[Saudi Arabia]] is third with over 650 units.\n\n==Development==\n===Impetus===\nThe United States entered a period of frenzied activity during the crisis atmosphere of the [[Korean War]], when America seemed to lag behind the Soviet Union in terms of tank quality and quantity.<ref name=\"benning.army.mil\">https://www.benning.army.mil/Armor/Historian/content/PDF/Armor%20Dev%20Cold%20War.pdf</ref> Testing and development cycles occurred simultaneously with production to ensure speedy delivery of new tanks. Such rapid production caused problems but the importance given to rapidly equipping combat units with new tanks precluded detailed testing and evaluation prior to quantity production.<ref name=\"benning.army.mil\"/>\n\nThe [[M47 Patton]] entered production in 1951 and was used by the United States Army and Marine Corps but ongoing technical and production problems kept it from serving in the Korean War. The [[M48 Patton]] tank entered US service in 1952 but its early designs were deemed unsatisfactory by Army Field Forces (AFF). The improvements to the M48 focused on improving the 90mm main gun and fire control systems while simultaneously exploring the development of silicas glass composite armor and autoloader systems. The tank continued further development through 1955 in conjunction with its simultaneous mass production. The course of its development during the mid 1950s was the source of widespread debate among Congressional Budget Oversight committees.\n\nThe [[T95 Medium Tank|T95 program]], which began in 1955 was intended to supersede the M48. It featured a host of innovative and experimental components such as its 90&nbsp;mm smoothbore T208 cannon rigidly affixed to its turret, experimental X-shaped engine design, composite armor and infrared rangefinder. The burden of developing them, however, slowed the overall program to a crawl. During the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, a Soviet [[T-54/T-55|T-54A]] medium tank was driven onto the grounds of the UK's embassy in Budapest by the Hungarians.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historynet.com/the-beast-of-budapest.htm |title=The Beast of Budapest |website=HistoryNet.com |date=19 July 2018 |access-date=1 June 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180921230135/http://www.historynet.com/the-beast-of-budapest.htm |archive-date=21 September 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> After a brief examination of this tank's armor by a British military attach\u00e9 it was concluded that the [[Ordnance QF 20-pounder|20-pounder (84mm L/66.7)]] was apparently incapable of defeating its frontal armor with HEAT or APC ammunition. Its 100mm main gun was a significant advancement over the weapon of the [[T-44]]. Also there were rumors of an even larger 115mm gun in the works. These events spurred the [[United Kingdom]] to develop a new tank gun in 1956, the [[Royal Ordnance L7]] to keep the [[Centurion (tank)|Centurion]] viable against this new Soviet tank design and the [[United States]] to develop the XM60 tank in 1957.<ref name=Halberstadt>{{Cite book |last=Halberstadt |first=Hans |title=Inside the Great Tanks |publisher=The Crowood Press |location=Wiltshire, England |year=1997 |pages=94\u201396 |isbn=1-86126-270-1 |oclc=40989477 |quote=The T-54/T-55 series is the hands down, all time most popular tank in history.}}</ref> This new tank design incorporated many Army Combat Vehicle (ARCOVE) committee improvements to the M48, chiefly the use of diesel engines to increase its operational range and the use of a more powerful main gun.\n\n===Choice of components===\n\n====M68 105 mm Main Gun====\nThe main gun was chosen after a comparative firing test of six different guns carried out on the Aberdeen Proving Grounds in 1958. The factors evaluated were accuracy, lethality of a hit, rate of fire and penetration performance.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|pages= 453\u2013454 }}\n\nAn M48A2C was fit with the 90&nbsp;mm M41 and tested with the new T300E53 HEAT round. A smoothbore version of the 90&nbsp;mm, the T208E9, was mounted on the T95E1 tank and tested the T320E62 APDS round. An American version of the British L7 105&nbsp;mm gun, under the name [[Royal Ordnance L7#United States|105&nbsp;mm T254E1]], was mounted on the T95E2 and tested with British APDS ammunition. Finally, two versions of the 120&nbsp;mm gun from the M103 were trialed, the existing M58 model and a lightened variant known as T123E6 which was mounted on the T95E4.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 155 }}\n\nThe T123E6 was preferred by the Ordnance Department because its ammunition, the same as that for the M58 gun, was already at an advanced state of development.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page=153 }} The ammunition was in two parts, shell and propellant bag, which required significant time to load. In the M103 this was addressed by adding a second loader, but a medium tank would not have the internal space needed for another crewmember and the firing rate would suffer as a result. In testing it demonstrated a maximum rate  of 4 rounds per minute vs. the T254's 7 rpm.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|pages= 453\u2013454 }}\n\nBased on these tests, the 105&nbsp;mm T254E1 was selected, modified to the T254E2 and standardized as the [[Royal Ordnance L7|Cannon, 105mm Gun, M68]]. It used a vertical sliding breechblock instead of the T254E1's horizontal breechblock. Until American-made barrels could be obtained with comparable accuracy, British X15/L52 barrels were to be used.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 155 }} US built XM24/L52 barrels (length 218.5 inches)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.williammaloney.com/Aviation/WatervlietArsenalMuseum/TankCannon/pages/09M68_105mmGun.htm|title=09 M68 105mm Gun|website=www.williammaloney.com|access-date=2019-05-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180121075334/http://www.williammaloney.com/Aviation/WatervlietArsenalMuseum/TankCannon/pages/09M68_105mmGun.htm|archive-date=2018-01-21|url-status=live}}</ref> fitted with an eccentric bore evacuator were used for the M60-series starting in June 1959 but retained interchangeability with the British X15/L52 barrel.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 152 }} All of the US guns and XM24 barrels were produced at the [[Watervliet Arsenal]], NY and the gun mounts (M116 for the M60 and M140 for the M60A1/A3) manufactured at the [[Rock Island Arsenal]], IL.<ref>https://www.gao.gov/assets/190/188401.pdf</ref> US M68 guns were fitted with an eccentric bore evacuator instead of a concentric model in order to provide more clearance over the rear deck.<ref name=\"Organizational Maintenance Manual--Tank 2306\">TM 9-2350-253-20-2 Organizational Maintenance Manual--Tank, Combat, Full Tracked: 105-mm Gun, M60A3 (2350-00-148-6548) and (2350-01-061-2306) TTS Turret.

The armor was improved, at 6 inches (155&nbsp;mm) on the front glacis and mantle of solid rolled homogeneous armor, while it was 4.3 inches (110&nbsp;mm) on the M48.

This hull model was used on the M60A1, M60A2 and M60A3 models of the M60-series as well as the M728A1 and M60A1 AVLB.

The T95E5 turret used on the M60 was hemispherically shaped and bore a strong resemblance to the M48 Patton. The M60A1 was the first version to employ the newly designed T95E7 turret with a redesigned bustle increasing the number of rounds for the main gun to 63. The M60A2 featured a specially designed turret for the M162 gun/missile launcher that greatly reduced the frontal arc in comparison to the M60A1's T95E7 turret.  The M60A3's turret was similar to the A1's but with increased armor protection for the frontal arc and mantlet in an effort to provide additional protection of the turret's hydraulics system.\n\n====M19 Commander's Cupola====\nA redesigned full vision cupola was envisioned for the commander's station. It had 7 tiltable vision blocks arranged to give the commander a 360 degree field of view with overlapping vision between adjacent vision blocks. The front vision block could be replaced with a dual power M34 7x50 binocular day sight or an M19E1 IR periscope. A special feature was that the cupola body could be raised up to 3 1/2 inches providing the commander a direct field of vision while remaining under armor protection. Access was through a hatch cover on the roof and a .50 caliber M2HB machine gun was pedestal mounted on the forward part of the cupola. It could be aimed and fired with the cupola closed. Also there was an 11 inch long hydraulically operated port on the left side allowing spent cartridge cases to be ejected.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 156 }} After creating a full-sized mock up of this design using the [[T95 Medium Tank#Versions and modifications|T95E6 turret]], it was dropped in favor of a design based on the M1 cupola of the M48A2's turret. This T9 cupola provided the commander with more headroom than the T6 cupola of the T95 tank, carrying a new [[Receiver (firearms)|short receiver]] M85/T175 .50 caliber machine gun{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 156 }} and it was standardized as the Cupola, Tank Commander's Caliber .50 Machine Gun,<ref name=\"Direct Support 1975\" /> M19. The first M19 cupola (a modified T9) was ready on 27 October 1958. It has an M28C sight for the machine gun in the forward part of the cupola and eight vision blocks. The front vision block can be replaced by a M19E1 infrared periscope or an M36E1 passive periscope for night observation.<ref name=\"ReferenceE\">{{Cite web | url=http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/weapons_m60patton.html |title = M60 Patton Main Battle Tank (USA)}}</ref> Initial production of the cupola was problematic. The first 300 M60s produced were armed with a .50cal M2HB machine gun in a pedestal mount welded to the left side of the commander's cupola owing to production problems with the new M85 machine gun. Of these tanks, the first 45 manufactured were made without the cupola itself, also due to production problems.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Crismon, Fred W. U.S. Military Tracked Vehicles. Osceola, WI: Motorbooks International, 1992</ref> All of these early M60s eventually had the M19 cupola and M85 machine gun installed.\n\nCompared to a conventional pintle mount, the remote-controlled M85 machine gun was relatively ineffective in the anti-aircraft role for which it was designed. Removing the cupola lowered the vehicle's relatively high silhouette. The cupola's hatch also opened toward the rear of the vehicle and was dangerous to close if under small-arms fire owing to a lock-open mechanism that required the user to apply leverage to unlock it prior to closing. The commander was able to observe the battlefield using the binocular M34 vision block or M19E1 IR Periscope while remaining under armor protection with a 360 degree traverse independent of the turret,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.onwar.com/weapons/afv/data/usambtm60a3.htm |title=M60A3 Patton |website=onwar.com |access-date=2019-06-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180914203428/https://www.onwar.com/weapons/afv/data/usambtm60a3.htm |archive-date=2018-09-14 |url-status=live }}</ref> was stabilized in azimuth and elevation<ref name=\"50megs.com\">{{cite web|url=http://afvdb.50megs.com/usa/pics/m60.html|title=105mm Gun Tank M60|website=afvdb.50megs.com|access-date=2019-05-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190528154422/http://afvdb.50megs.com/usa/pics/m60.html|archive-date=2019-05-28|url-status=live}}</ref> and carried 600 rounds of ammunition.<ref name=\"onwar.com1\">{{cite web |url=https://www.onwar.com/weapons/afv/data/usambtm60.htm |title=M60 Patton |website=onwar.com |access-date=2019-04-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190426112135/https://www.onwar.com/weapons/afv/data/usambtm60.htm |archive-date=2019-04-26 |url-status=live }}</ref> All M60s in US service retained the M19 cupola until the tank was phased out of service. The few M60A3s in Army service as training vehicles had their commander's cupola removed as it was deemed unnecessary for training and to better mimic the profile of Soviet tanks. Some M48A5s were retrofitted with the M19 cupola to maintain training levels of National Guard units.\n\n====Main Battle Tank Designation====\nThe concept of the [[medium tank]] gradually evolved into the [[Main Battle Tank]] (MBT) in the 1960s. The MBT was to combine the firepower and protection sufficient for the assault role with the mobility to perform as a medium tank.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 149 }} The main battle tank thus took on the role the British had once called the \"universal tank\", exemplified by the [[Centurion (tank)|British Centurion]], filling almost all battlefield roles. Typical main battle tanks were as well armed as any other vehicle on the battlefield, highly mobile, and well armored. Yet they were cheap enough to be built in large numbers. The first generation consists of the medium tanks designed and produced directly after World War II that were later redefined as main battle tanks. These were exemplified by the [[M47 Patton|M47]] and [[M48 Patton]]s armed with  a 90mm main gun already in widespread US service. The original variant of the M60 series also fulfilled the definition of a late first generation MBT sometimes being referred to as an intermediate second generation design. The Soviet [[T-54/T-55|T-54 and T-55]] as well as the original configuration of the [[T-62|T-62A]] tank designs are also regarded as first generation MBTs. The second generation had enhanced night-fighting capabilities and in most cases NBC protection. Most western tanks of this generation were armed with the 105&nbsp;mm Royal Ordnance L7 tank gun or derivatives of it. Notable are the [[Chieftain (tank)|British Chieftain]] and [[Leopard 1|German Leopard 1]]. The United States fully committed to the main battle tank doctrine in 1963 when the Marine Corps deactivated its last [[M103 (heavy tank)|M103 Heavy Tank]] battalion.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1988|page= 327 }} The first American nomenclature-designated second generation MBT was the M60A1 version of the M60 series. The term MBT is used in strategic doctrine and the composition of force as determined by the United States Army. The M60 series tanks fulfilled the MBT role on a strategic and tactical level. It was never referred to as such in any official training or technical manuals. The first Soviet second generation main battle tank designs were the [[T-64]] and [[T-72]].<ref>\u0422\u0430\u043d\u043a \u0422-62. \u0420\u0443\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u043f\u043e \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0438 \u044d\u043a\u0441\u043f\u043b\u0443\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438. 1968</ref>\n\n===Production Versions===\n\n===XM60 Development===\nBy May 1957 it became clear that the [[T95 Medium Tank]] would not have a significant advantage over the [[M48A2]]. The X-shaped motor and electro-optical rangefinder were both discarded due to performance, and the accuracy of the smoothbore gun continued to be unsatisfactory. All this led to the closure of the T95 project on July 7, 1960. At the same time, work on the T95E7 turret was continued, which led to the creation of the fairly successful M60A1 turret.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 149 }} The course of the M48 Patton's tank production was the source of widespread Congressional debate. The [[Office of Management and Budget|Bureau of the Budget]] believed that the Army was not progressing with sufficient speed in its tank modernization program and recommended the immediate replacement of the M48A2. Correctly predicting that Congress would not approve the procurement of the M48A2 after the fiscal year 1959, the Deputy Chief of Staff, Logistics (DCSLOG) proposed a tank based on the M48A2 featuring improved firepower and the AVDS-1790 engine. Since the main gun had not yet been specified, four XM60 weapons systems were submitted in September 1957.\n\n[[File:XM60 120 big.png|thumb|left|Concept design #1 of the XM60 mounting the T123E6 main gun and British styled gun barrel, the newly designed full-vision cupola using the T95E6 turret as preferred by the Ordnance Department.]] \nThe first concept was armed with the 120mm gun T123E6 in the long nosed T95E6 turret. This was the design preferred by the Ordnance Department. It was fitted with a newly designed full-vision commander's cupola. A full sized mock-up of this turret was constructed before this concept was dropped, mainly due to its slow rate of fire. The second carried the 105mm rifled T254E2 main gun in the T95E5 type turret and the T9 cupola style of the M48A2. The T254 guns used British X15/L52 barrels with a concentric bore evacuator on the barrel.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 62 }} The Army Ordnance Technical Committee chose this design for production in August 1958. The third concept was to mount the 90mm T208 smooth-bore main gun and the T95E6 turret. It never progressed beyond design drawings. The fourth used the T95E1 turret and the T208 main gun. A mock-up was built using the new vision cupola. All of these conceptual designs were referred to as the XM60. A contract was awarded to Chrysler Engineering in September 1958 for the advanced production engineering (APE) of the XM60 concept #2.{{sfn|Lathrop|McDonald|2003|page= 47 }} The T95 hull was considered however its one-piece front casting was too difficult and expensive to produce in quantity. Some existing T95 hulls were re-fitted with the AVDS-1790 engine and used from 1960 to 1964 to develop the T118E1 prototyping of the [[M728 Combat Engineer Vehicle]].<ref>Tank Data, vol. 3. Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD: US Army Ordnance School, Jul 1968.</ref> Instead the decision was made to use modified M48A2 hulls. The hulls had 3 return rollers and 6 steel roadwheel pairs per side with no shock absorbers, using only bumper springs on the first and sixth roadwheel arms, along with a widened turret well and ring, and a flat wedge-shaped glacis. The T254E2 gun was chosen to be the main weapon of the tank in August 1958 being standardized as the M68 105mm gun. After a briefing on 11 December 1958, [[Maxwell D. Taylor|General Maxwell Taylor]] ordered the XM60 into production because of the improvements it offered in firepower, protection, and cruising range.{{sfn|Lathrop|McDonald|2003|page= 47 }}  Since the tank had not yet received its official designation these prototype hulls were briefly referred to as the M68 in December 1958 until they were officially named the M60 in March 1959.<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com3\" /> Fulfilling this requirement was an interim tank design that resulted in the M60-series,{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 152 }} which largely resembles the M48 it was based on, but has significant differences.\n\n===M60===\n[[File:M60 Pilot 1.jpg|thumb|M60 production pilot number 1 after completion by Chrysler on 2 July 1959.

Production pilot 2 was finished on 4 August and used to develop technical publications and an additional 47 tanks produced to complete the first low rate production buy. In August 1959, an engineering bid package was awarded for the second low rate production buy of M60s to be built at the Delaware Plant. Production pilot 3 was completed 2 September and went to the Detroit Arsenal Test Center for maintenance evaluations, it was then sent to Fort Knox for user trials. The fourth pilot was completed on 26 October  and was used as the master hull to verify production standards at the Detroit Tank Plant with a low-rate initial production total of 180 M60s built in 1959.<ref name=\"ReferenceE\"/> Subsequent production, starting with the October 1960 batch were built at the [[Detroit Arsenal (Warren, Michigan)|Detroit Arsenal Tank Plant]], in Warren Michigan. It reached operational capability with fielding to Army units in Europe beginning in December 1960.<ref name=\"historyofwar.org\"/> \n;Features\nThe original variant of the M60 series ultimately was produced as a quick fix engineering (QFE) upgrade of the M48 due to the Soviet Union's tank advancements of the late 1950s and the delays from developing the silicas armor and an improved turret design. The M60 mounted a 105&nbsp;mm M68 main gun with the [[bore evacuator]] mounted towards the middle of the tube carrying 57 rounds in the clamshell shaped turret style of the M48. Nine rounds were stowed in the left side of the turret bustle behind the loader.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://afvdb.50megs.com/usa/pics/m48patton.html |title=90mm Gun Tank M48 Patton 48 |website=afvdb.50megs.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190424102744/http://afvdb.50megs.com/usa/pics/m48patton.html |archive-date=2019-04-24 |url-status=live }}</ref> The remaining rounds were stored inside safe containers on the hull floor.<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com3\"/> A new short receiver coaxial machine gun was designed for the M60 tank.

The ballistic computer is a mechanically driven unit that permits ammunition selection, range correction, and superelevation correction by the gunner.

The superelevation actuator adds sufficient hydraulic fluid to the elevating mechanism to correctly position the gun.<ref name=\"dtic.mil\"/>\n\nIn late 1962 a kit was fielded that allowed the use of the AN/VSS-1(V)1 IR searchlight. The searchlight has both infrared and visible light capabilities and was positioned over the gun. Along with an M32 IR periscope for the gunner, M19 IR periscope and M18 IR binoculars for the commander provided [[Night-vision device#Generation 1|first generation night vision]] capability to the M60 and M60A1 tanks. This kit was also compatible with the M48A5.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|pages= 166\u2013167 }}\n\nThe hull bottom had a strong boat-like appearance with a pronounced recess between the upper tracks and external suspension arms with cast aluminum roadwheels and return rollers along with a single shock absorber on the first roadwheel pair. Cast aluminum road wheels were used to save weight. The armor was improved, at 6 inches (155&nbsp;mm) on the front glacis and mantle of solid rolled homogeneous armor, while it was 4.3 inches (110&nbsp;mm) on the M48.  Power was provided by the AVDS-1790-2A engine, CD-850-5 cross drive transmission and the T97E2 track assembly as used on the M48A3.<ref>afvdb.50megs.com/usa/m48patton.html</ref> The drive sprocket is located at the rear of the hull. The vehicle also provides full NBC protection for the crew using the M13A1 protection system creating a positive atmospheric pressure in the crew compartment. The positive pressure keeps contaminated air out and forces the smoke produced from firing the main or coax guns out of the vehicle. Access between the driver's compartment and the turret fighting compartment was also restricted, requiring that the turret be traversed to the rear.\n\nThe M60 was deployed to [[West Germany]] to counter the threat presented from the [[T-54]]s and [[T-55]]s of the Soviet Union and [[Warsaw Pact]] as well as to South Korea but was never sent to [[Republic of Vietnam|South Vietnam]] mainly due to unfavorable terrain and the general lack of significant numbers of North Vietnamese armor.

It featured several design improvements  including an updated gun hydraulic configuration, a stabilization upgrade for the gun, a gun elevation kill switch for the loader, improved ballistic drive and other component refinements.<ref name=\"ReferenceI\"/>\n\n;Upgrades\nAs development of a new main battle tank stalled with problems and cost escalating quickly, the M60A1 was forced to serve longer than originally intended with production lasting almost 20 years. In that time span numerous product improvement programs were put forward. As the major changes were incorporated into the production line, the vehicle model designations were changed. The first of which was Top Loading Air Cleaner (TLAC) in 1971. This reduced dirt and dust ingestion, which increased engine life as well as easier servicing of the engine.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 199 }} Early TLAC panels were made from aluminum and were vulnerable to damage from small arms fire.<ref name=\"dtic.mil\"/> Next came Add-On Stabilization (AOS) that was introduced in late 1972.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 199 }} This was an add-on kit made to fit with minimum modifications to the existing hydraulic gun control system. The add-on-stabilization system provides stabilization control for both gun elevation and turret traverse. It provides the gunner with the capability of aiming and target tracking and also improved surveillance of the battlefield terrain by the gunner while the tank is moving.<ref name=\"dtic.mil\"/> It may be used in any one of three modes of control: (1) power-with-stabilization-on, (2) power-with-stabilization-off, and (3) manual. In the power-with-stabilization-on mode, the gunner's aim on target is automatically retained while the vehicle is in motion. This mode provides a fire-on the-move capability. The power-with-stabilization-off option eliminates needless exercise of the stabilization system and provides a back up power mode. The manual back up system permits the crew to aim and fire the weapons should the electrical/hydraulical subsystems fail.<ref name=\"dtic.mil\"/> At a range of 2000 meters, hit probabilities of better than 70% from a moving M60A1 were obtained in Aberdeen<ref name=\"dtic.mil\"/> test results while without a stabilizer it was essentially zero. M60A1s with this upgrade were denoted as the M60A1(AOS). The T142 track was fielded in 1974 which had replaceable rubber pads, better end connecters and improved service life.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 200 }} M60A1(AOS)+ was the denotation for M60A1s equipped with the TLAC, AOS and the T142 track.<ref name=\"dtic.mil\"/>\n\nIntroduced in 1975 the Reliability Improved Selected Equipment (RISE) was a comprehensive upgrade of the M60A1 hull as well as integrating the previous TLAC and AOS upgrades. It included the upgraded [[Continental AV1790|AVDS-1790-2C RISE diesel engine]] and CD-850-6 transmission that featured several changes in order to improve service life and reliability. A new 650 ampere oil cooled alternator, a solid state regulator and new wiring harness with more accessible disconnectors was also incorporated into the hull's electrical system{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 200 }} as well as armored steel TLAC panels and the return to the use of steel roadwheels and return rollers. They were denoted as M60A1(RISE).<ref name=\"dtic.mil\"/> The 1977 fielding of the passive M32E1 sight for the gunner and M36E1 periscope for the commander as well as the M24E1 IR night vision block for the driver provided [[Night-vision device#Generation 2 (GEN II)|second generation night vision]] capabilities for M60A1 and RISE tanks. These new passive gunner's sight and commander's periscope provide recognition capability at longer ranges and at relatively low night light levels (1/2 moonlight). Under starlight conditions, they will provide recognition beyond 500 meters with the use of an IR searchlight.<ref name=\"dtic.mil\"/> During 1978 a kit for the mounting of the M240 as the coaxial machine gun was fielded.  The development of the M735 [[Armour-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot|APFSDS]] ammunition required a cam update to the gun's mechanical ballistic drive for accurate firing. M60A1s configured to this standard were denoted as M60A1(RISE)+.\n[[File:US Army M551 Sheridan German village.jpg|thumb|A US Army M60A1 RISE Passive tank maneuvers through a narrow German village street while participating in [[Exercise REFORGER|REFORGER]] 1982.]]\nThe M60A1(RISE) Passive featured the implementation of all previous updates plus Kevlar spall liners for the turret, AN/VVS-2 passive night vision block for the driver, a deep water fording kit, the capability to mount Explosive Reactive Armor (ERA){{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 202 }}{{sfn|Lathrop|McDonald|2003|page= 56 }} and the AVDS-1790-2D RISE engine with CD-850-6A transmission and a Vehicle Engine Exhaust Smoke System (VEESS) that visually obscured the area around the vehicle. The VEESS smokescreen system does not provide protection against infrared, thermal or laser detection. The two six-barreled, electronically fired M239 smoke grenade launchers, one on each side of the main gun and replacement of the coax machine gun with the M240C were implemented in late 1978. The smoke grenades contains a phosphors compound that masks the thermal signature of the vehicle to the enemy.  They were denoted as M60A1(RISE) Passive.<ref name=\"dtic.mil\"/>\n\nOver the period of M60A1 tank production several essential engineering changes were incorporated. Many of these miscellaneous changes are to improve the system safety, reliability, maintainability and increase mission performance. The M60A1 tank Hull/Turret PIP Update Kit includes those items that could not be readily identified with basic major product improvements and to incorporate essential engineering changes that had occurred during M60A1 tank production. The update program included engineering changes and minor product improvements which were not part of specific product improvements, but were required to upgrade early vintage M60A1 tanks up to the current M60A1(RISE) Passive production configuration.<ref name=\"dtic.mil\"/>\n\nThe M60A1 was in production from October 1962 until May 1980<ref name=\"historyofwar.org\"/> and was extensively used by the US Army and Marine Corps as well as being widely exported to foreign governments. A total of 7,948 M60A1s (all variants including E60A) were built.{{sfn|Lathrop|McDonald|2003|page= 327 }} Many of them were later converted to the A3 standard.\n\n===M60A2{{anchor|M60A2}}===\nDuring the early 1960s there was some debate regarding the future of main tank weaponry, largely focusing on conventional kinetic energy rounds versus missiles. In the early 1960s it was generally accepted that the maximum effective range of the M68 gun was between 1800 and 2000 meters. The XM-13/MGM-51 missile system had proven itself viable, obtaining over 90% first round accuracy up to 4000 meters. But the development of a main-battle tank variant was bogged down by having too many design proposals. In response, studies were made in August 1961 to retrofit existing M60 tanks with a weapon capable of firing both conventional HEAT (High-Explosive Anti-Tank) rounds and launching ATGMs (Anti-Tank Guided-Missiles).<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com4\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tanks-encyclopedia.com/coldwar/US/medium-tank-m60a2-starship/|title=152mm Gun/Launcher M60A2 'Starship'|date=7 July 2017|website=Tank Encyclopedia}}</ref> Three M60E1 tanks with T95 turrets were modified to permit the installation of the 152mm XM81 gun-launcher. Mounted on former M60 hulls, they were to provide test beds for the evaluation of the Shillelagh weapon system. Although this system was the preferred armament for the MBT-70, by late 1961 problems with the XM13 missile required that the program be reorganized. The missile was reclassified as an applied research project and it was obvious that there would be some delay before it would be available for service.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 627 }} On 10 January 1962, representatives from various ordnance organizations met at the Ordnance Tank-Automotive Center (OTAC) to review armament systems that might be suitable replacements, if the Shillelagh missile could not be developed in a timely manner. Time was particularly critical for the AR/AAV (the XM551 Sheridan) which required a decision on the armament by April 1962. The possible delay was not as serious for the MBT-70 since the program was limited to conceptual design and component development. The requirements also differed for the tank because of its ability to carry a much heavier weapon system. Several backup weapons were also under consideration and concept studies were prepared showing their application to the MBT-70 concepts. The 152mm gun-launcher XM81 also was considered without the missile depending only on the combustible case conventional ammunition. It was expected that the Shillelagh or some other missile then could be introduced at a later date. The 105mm gun M68 as standardized for the M60 tank was considered as an alternate armament system. It had the advantage of being immediately available and its ammunition was already in production. Of the several turrets drafted, one of the earliest was the driver-in-turret integrated fighting compartment. This design was further developed using the [[MBT-70]]. Another proposal was a more compact turret design of the T95E7.<ref>Hunnicutt, R.P. Patton: A History of the American Main Battle Tank, volume 1. Navato, CA: Presidio Press, 1984 pp.631-633</ref>\n\n;Development\n[[File:XM66 Type C design concept.png|thumb|Conceptual drawing of the XM66 with Type C turret]]\nDuring the development of the M60A2, three different turret types were considered, the Type A, Type B and Type C. The Type A turret would be constructed based on the T95E7 turret and then further modified and produced as the Type B standard. The Type C turret was essentially a larger [[M551 Sheridan]]-style turret. A mock-up of this turret was built, but the design was never seriously considered and soon abandoned. All of these conceptual variants were referred to as the XM66. On 10 January 1964, the Army reviewed all three variants and selected the Type A variant for further development. Initially two Type A turrets were built in 1964.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 138 }} The M60A1 hull was used starting in 1966 to develop the new compact turret design using the 152mm M162/XM81E13 rifled barrel main gun. These developmental tanks were designated as the M60A1E series.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 141 }}\n\nThe M60A1E1 referred to vehicles based on the modified T95E7 Type A turrets with M60 hulls used through 1965. The M60A1E1 variant was used to evaluate the M162/XM81E13 gun on different mounts and compatibility with the XM13 Guided Missile, Armor Defeating together with the XMTM51 training round. They used a modified M60A1/T95E7 turret. During the early testing of the M162/XM81E13 main gun it was noted that misfires and premature detonations of the M409 conventional case ammunition were caused by unburnt propellant in the bore and breech. This flaw was often catastrophic as it set off the projectile in the barrel as it was fired.<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.tanks-encyclopedia.com/coldwar/US/medium-tank-m60a2-starship/ |title=152mm Gun/Launcher M60A2 'Starship' |date=7 July 2017 |access-date=1 June 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190327085943/http://www.tanks-encyclopedia.com/coldwar/US/medium-tank-m60a2-starship/ |archive-date=27 March 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> To remedy this the guns were equipped with a traditional fume extractor on the barrel.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= }} The XM81E13 Gun/Launcher also experienced frequent faulty breaches, often not closing correctly during a missile firing, allowing the exhaust of the launching Shillelagh to vent hot noxious gasses into the crew compartment.<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com4\"/> [[File:M60A1E1 Tank.jpg|thumb|left|M60A1E2 tank prototype with Type B turret.]] As the M60A1 hull became available in 1966, it was decided to upgrade these prototype vehicles to the M60A1 standard. Vehicles using the M60A1 hull and chassis received the M60A1E2 designation, and were used to develop the Type B compact turret.<ref>Sabot Publications, M60A2 Main Battle Tank in Detail, Volume 1/</ref> The M60A1E2 finalized the turret design with the use of a compact turret which reduced exposed frontal area by 40% compared to the M60A1 and continued development of the M51 Missile Guidance System (M51MGS).<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com2\"/> These were later standardized as the M60A2. Initial plans called to retrofit the turret of every M60 with the new A2 turret, and use them in the mobile anti-armor role  alongside the M60A1 tanks. But the continual technical and reliability difficulties with the dual purpose gun caused this to be abandoned. The M60A1E3 variant was a prototype mounting the M68 105&nbsp;mm rifled gun to the turret of the M60A1E2. This was evaluated due to several earlier faults noted in the M60A1E1's main gun. Compared to the Shillelagh system, the use of the 105mm gun increased the overall tank weight by about 1700 pounds.<ref>Hunnicutt, R.P. Patton: A History of the American Main Battle Tank, volume 1. Navato, CA: Presidio Press, 1984 p.632</ref> The M60A1E4 was a conceptual variant that explored the use of various remote controlled weapons, including a 20mm gun as secondary armament. A mock-up of this design using the Type C turret was constructed. All variants of this series underwent evaluations and trials at the [[Aberdeen Proving Grounds]].<ref name=\"auto3\"/> The M60A1E2 was finally accepted by the Army in 1970 and given the designation Tank, Combat, Full Tracked: 152-mm Gun/Launcher, M60A2.<ref name=\"sabot_m60a2\">{{cite book|title=M60A2 Main Battle Tank in Detail|volume=2|page=5|publisher=Sabot|location=St. Charles, MO|year=2016|isbn=978-0-9973774-3-9}}</ref> Initial orders were submitted by the Army in 1971 however production did not start until 1973 and continued until 1975.

It consisted of a large disk with a narrow channel in the center with each crew member in the turret having their own hatch. The gunner and loader were located to the right and left of the gun, respectively, and the commander was in a turret basket up and behind the main gun. As a result, each crew member was effectively isolated from one another with the gunner and loader separated by Shillelagh missiles in their storage position. The commander was in the rear compartment under a large redesigned cupola, which somewhat negated the low profile silhouette of the turret.<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com4\"/> The M162 gun was fully stabilized in both turret traverse and gun elevation using the same upgrade kit as the M60A1 AOS. This system could be used by the gunner to engage targets with unguided M409 rounds while the vehicle was in motion, but the tank had to remain stationary when firing and tracking an MGM-51 missile.<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com4\"/> The turret interior also received Kevlar spall liners. Four M226 smoke grenade launchers were mounted on each side of the turret bustle.<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com2\"/> Additionally  there was a mounting point to the left of the turret for an AN/VSS-1(V)1 Infrared Spotlight and M19E1 IR periscope providing [[Night-vision device#Generation 1|first generation night vision]] for night operations. A basket was fitted to the rear of the turret to stow the spotlight when not in use. Late production versions replaced the bore evacuator with the Closed-Bore Scavenger System (CBSS), a compressed air system that pushed the fumes and gasses out of the muzzle when the breach was opened.<ref name=\"auto5\"/> Initial production M60A2s used the M60A1 hull powered by an AVDS-1790-2A TLAC engine, CD-850-5 cross-drive transmission and the T97 track assembly.

After acquiring a target a small charge would propel the missile out of the barrel, the missile's solid-fueled sustainer rocket then ignited and launched the Shillelagh. For the time of flight of the missile, the gunner had to keep the cross-hairs pointed at the target. A direct infrared beam  missile tracker in the gunner's sight detected any deviation of the flight path from the line-of-sight to the target, and transmitted corrective commands to the missile via an infrared command link. The MGM-51A was stabilized by flip-out fins, and controlled by hot gas jet reaction controls.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.designation-systems.net/dusrm/m-51.html|title=Ford MGM-51 Shillelagh|website=www.designation-systems.net}}</ref> The gunner also employed an [[M73 Machine gun|M73]] (later replaced with a [[M240 machine gun|M240C]]) to the gun mantle's right with 2,000 rounds.<ref>Sabot Publications, M60A2 Main Battle Tank in Detail, Volume</ref> The commanders cupola was redesigned causing the [[M85 machine gun|M85]] to be mounted in the inverted position in order to provide access to its feed cover and mounted a single M34 periscope carrying 600 rounds.<ref name=\"auto5\">Sabot Publications, M60A2 Main Battle Tank in Detail, Volume 2</ref> The M60A2's combat load for the M162 main gun consisted of 33 M409 rounds and 13 [[MGM-51 Shillelagh]] missiles.<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com2\"/>\n\n;Flaws\nThis weapon system had several drawbacks.

Furthermore, the M60A2 could not fire or track a missile while moving.<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com2\"/> Secondly was the high minimum range of about 730&nbsp;m (2,400&nbsp;ft). Until the missile reached this range it flew beneath the tracking system's infrared beam and could therefore not be guided by the infrared command link. Also minimum range was slightly above the maximum effective range of the M60A2's conventional unguided munition, this created a dangerous gap area that could not be adequately covered by fire known as a \"dead zone\". It was also discovered that structural cracks in the barrel occurred after several missile firings. This defect was traced to a flaw in the longitudinal key, which fitted into a keyway inside the gun barrel. It was determined that a less deep key would significantly extend the service life of the barrel. The Missile Control System was also very fragile owing to its dependence on vacuum tubes which often broke when firing the gun.  Finally a Shillelagh missile was considerably more expensive than the M409 round. The vehicle was one of the most technologically complex of its era, eventually garnering an unofficial nickname of \"Starship\".<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com2\"/> This also contributed to its failure, largely due to difficulties with maintenance, training, and complicated operation.\n\nThe M60A2 proved a disappointment, though its technical advancements would pave the way for future tanks. Its intended successor, the [[MBT-70]], was canceled in 1971 and its funding diverted into the [[History of the M1 Abrams#Development|conceptual development of the XM1 Abrams]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ground/mbt-70.htm |title = MBT-70 / Xm803}}</ref> The Shillelagh/M60A2 system was phased out from active units by 1981, and the turrets scrapped.

These were essentially M60s with minor modifications requested by approved foreign purchasers.  Some of the modifications included removal of the M19 cupola, different models of machine guns, electronics, fire control systems or radios, external armor plates, smoke launchers and power packs.<ref>https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a528585.pdf</ref> Israel purchased many of these tanks forming the basis for the [[Magach#Versions|Magach 6]] series.\n\nThis series included the following designations:\n*E60: modified M60 variant for non-US service\n*E60A: modified M60A1 variant for non-US service\n*E60B: modified M60A3 variant for non-US service\n\nThe M60A2 was never approved for foreign sales.\n\n===Foreign upgrades===\nA [[United States Congress|US Congressional Report]] in November 1993 stated that there were 5,522 serviceable M60A1 and M60A3 tanks in the US Army's inventory available for sale or transfer to US allies or foreign nations. Of these 111 were in [[South Korea|Korea]], 1,435 were in [[Europe]], and 3,976 located in the continental US (CONUS). The average age of these tanks was 16 years and an expected peacetime service life of 20 years. The average price was US$212,898 per tank without radios or machine guns and they were not overhauled. Tanks located in Korea were inspected and sold to [[Bahrain]] and [[Taiwan]]. Of the 1,435 tanks in Europe, 1,311 have been cascaded to other NATO countries under the terms of the [[Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe|Conventional Forces Europe Agreement]] (CFE), 18 reserved for non-combat use and 106 returned to CONUS. Egypt inspected 411 tanks at Fort Hood and 91 at Fort Knox and tentatively selected 299 of those.

M60 series tanks were phased out of US service by 1997 and [[Opposing Force|OPFOR(S)]] training use in 2005. Together with the large number of M60MBTs still in foreign service and a large US Army surplus inventory, several upgrades for the tank were offered starting in 1985. There are three basic approaches to upgrade decisions for the M60MBT. Some countries, such as Taiwan and Jordan, have sought to modernize the M60 as a frontline main battle tank. Turkey is seeking a middle-ground, keeping it useful as it develops more modern designs. Other countries, such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Thailand are modernizing their M60 fleets for counterinsurgency-type operations. While the market for M60 modernization is somewhat limited, because the tank is generally operated by poorer countries or has been relegated to secondary tasks, other companies have come up with more advanced upgrade solutions. Additionally, several countries also funded their own design upgrades, notable examples are the [[Magach]], [[Sabra (tank)|Sabra]] and Phoenix variants. In 2005, M60 variants were in service with [[Military of Egypt|Egypt]], [[Military of Greece|Greece]], [[Israel Defense Forces|Israel]], [[Royal Jordanian Army|Jordan]], [[Turkish Army|Turkey]], [[Republic of China Army|Taiwan]] and some 20 other nations to varying degrees.\n\n====Super M60/AX====\n[[File:Super-m60.jpg|thumb|right|General Dynamics Super M60/AX prototype, 1985]]The Super M60/AX, also called ''Super 60'', was a comprehensive update package for the M60A1 and A3 tanks, first offered in 1985 by General Dynamics. The vehicle was developed as a private venture for the export market and was never evaluated for US military service. The upgrade offered to increase the protection, firepower and mobility for the M60A1 and A3 tanks.\n\nAlthough the US Army chose not to pursue the installation of a new power pack or suspension system in the M60 series, General Dynamics formed a co-operative private venture with Telledyne Continental to develop an upgrade. The new engine and suspension not only smoothen the off-road ride, but also allowed the M60/AX to handle well in spite of its considerable weight increase over the original M60A1. After initial tests, additional modifications were applied, featuring an armor upgrade intended to increase protection from shaped charged projectiles.<ref>http://www.military-today.com/tanks/super_m60.htm</ref> It was referred to as the Super 60 Program.\n\nThe tank upgrade is based on the M60A1 RISE hull and the T95E7 turret as used on the M60A1 and A3 variants of the M60 series. Mobility was increased by 20% with a new engine and transmission. It featured the AVCR-1790-1B engine coupled to a Renk RK-304 transmission with 4 forward and 4 reverse gears. The torsion bar suspension system of the M60 was replaced with the National Waterlift hydropneumatic suspension system (HSS).{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1988|pages=  }} Survivability was enhanced with a layer of Chobham spaced [[Vehicle armour#Appliqu\u00e9|applique armor]] built around the M60A1 turret, that noticeably changed its appearance. The hull armor is enhanced with a layer of laminated [[Vehicle armour#Steel|steel armor panels]] covering the frontal arc of the hull. A pair of steel track skirts were added as well as Kevlar spall liners for the fighting compartment. It has a crew of 4, the commander, loader and gunner are positioned in the turret and the driver in the front of the hull.\n[[File:Magach-7-latrun-2.jpg|left|thumb|Magach 7C in Yad la-Shiryon museum, Latrun.]]\nThe weapons of the M60/AX are similar to those of the M60A3, but different models were used. The main gun is the rifled 105&nbsp;mm/L55 M68A1E2 with a longer XM24 tube and a thermal sleeve, the same weapon used on the M1 and M1IP versions of the [[M1 Abrams]] MBT with 43 rounds.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tanknutdave.com/the-us-super-m60-tank-upgrade-package/|title=The US Super M60 Tank Upgrade Package}}</ref>  The 7.62&nbsp;mm M73 coaxial machine gun used on the M60A1 is replaced with a 7.62&nbsp;mm M240C, with the same number of rounds. The M19 cupola was replaced with a low silhouette model with a pop-up hatch for the commander and a 12.7&nbsp;mm [[M2 Browning|M2HB]] machine gun on a pintle mount with 600 rounds. The Fire Control System (FCS) is essentially the same as used on the M60A3TTS consisting of an M21E1 solid-state ballistic computer, Raytheon AN/VSG2 Tank Thermal Sight (TTS) for the gunner, a Raytheon AN/VVS2 flash-lamp pumped ruby-laser based range finder, accurate up to 5000 meters, an M10A2E3 electro-mechanical ballistic drive and solid-state analog data card bus.  The [[prototype]] built did not have an optical range finder but one could have been easily installed.\n\nAs one of the first upgrade packages offered for the M60 series, the M60/AX prototype demonstrated the potential for upgrading the M60A1/A3 and even the M48 series as well. Even though this update package offered M60 users an opportunity to dramatically increase the combat capabilities of their tank fleets, no country ever bought the update, and the program effectively ceased by the end of the [[Cold War]]. Only one [[prototype]] was built. The overall failure of the Super 60 Program was likely due to the lack of immediate necessity for such a vehicle.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.military-today.com/tanks/super_m60.htm |title=Super M60 Prototype Main Battle Tank |website=Military-today.com |access-date=2019-06-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190520231703/http://www.military-today.com/tanks/super_m60.htm |archive-date=2019-05-20 |url-status=live }}</ref> This design was also developed independently by Israel in their [[Magach#Versions|Magach 7]] series.\n\n====M60-2000 Main Battle Tank====\n{{main|M60-2000 Main Battle Tank}}\n[[File:M60-1220S.png|thumb|right|M60-120S]]\nThe [[General Dynamics Land Systems]] (GDLS) M60-2000 or 120S was an upgrade of the M60A1 tank. The development of the M60-2000 was primarily due to the large number of M60 Main Battle Tanks in service with many Middle Eastern nations unable to afford a sufficient force of more modern main battle tanks. The upgrade was marketed at those M60 users with the industrial capability to convert the tanks themselves. The M60-2000/120S was a GDLS supplied conversion kit that married the M1A1 turret of the [[M1 Abrams]] to the M60A1 RISE hull, offering many features of the M1A1 Abrams to existing M60 users at a reduced cost.\n\nIt was first referred to the M60-2000 Program and design work began in late 1999 by General Dynamics Land Systems as a private venture for the export market and was never evaluated for US military service. Later the M60 designation was dropped because of the extensive changes and to highlight this as a new vehicle to potential customers thus changing the name to the 120S Project. The M60-2000 was test-marketed during 2000 and a number of countries in NATO and the Middle East were briefed on the vehicle. Following customer feedback, detailed engineering work was carried out and in December GDLS decided to build a functional prototype.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ground/m60-2000.htm |title = M60-2000 / 120S Main Battle Tank}}</ref> In August 2001 the company rolled out the fully functional prototype of the 120S MBT at their Detroit, Michigan, facility. The prototype was shown at the IDEF Exhibition held in Turkey in October 2001.\n\nThe 120S was initially aimed at the Turkish Land Forces Command (TLFC) M60 upgrade requirement but this competition was subsequently won by [[Israel Military Industries|IMI Military Industries]] with their [[Sabra (tank)|Sabra II]] upgrade. The [[Egyptian Army]] was considering this offer until it was finally rejected in favor of a licensed contract to build M1s in Egypt.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.dsca.mil/major-arms-sales/egypt-co-production-m1a1-abrams-tank |title = Egypt - Co-production of M1A1 Abrams Tank &#124; the Official Home of the Defense Security Cooperation Agency}}</ref> Only one prototype was made.

An Office 365 Group can be organized in Outlook, SharePoint Online, Yammer, Microsoft Teams and other collaboration tools to diversify the native collaboration capabilities of these applications. For example, if a team collaborates in a Group in Yammer, its members automatically get a team calendar, a shared Outlook inbox, a SharePoint library, a SharePoint team site, a shared OneNote notebook and Planner.\n\n===Updates===\nThe Office 365 platform uses a [[rolling release]] model; updates to the online components of the service are provided once per quarter.

accessible to users with any level of expertise, the seamless integration of SkyDrive Pro into the Office 2013 desktop applications, and the service as a whole for being suitable in small business environments, while still offering \"powerful\" options for use in larger companies (such as [[Data loss prevention software|data loss protection]] and the ability to integrate with a local [[Active Directory]] instance). However, the service was severely criticized for how it handled its 2013 update for existing users, and its lack of integration with services such as [[Skype]] and [[Yammer]].<ref

accessible to users with any level of expertise, the seamless integration of SkyDrive Pro into the Office 2013 desktop applications, and the service as a whole for being suitable in small business environments, while still offering \"powerful\" options for use in larger companies (such as [[Data loss prevention software|data loss protection]] and the ability to integrate with a local [[Active Directory]] instance). However, the service was severely criticized for how it handled its 2013 update for existing users, and its lack of integration with services such as [[Skype]] and [[Yammer]].<ref name=techradar-365review/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin|colwidth=30em}}\n* {{cite web\n  |url = https://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2010/oct10/10-19Office365.mspx\n  |title = Microsoft Announces Office 365\n  |work = Microsoft News Center\n  |publisher = [[Microsoft Corporation]]\n  |date = October 19, 2010\n  |accessdate =October 25, 2010\n  |location = Redmond, WA\n  }}\n* {{cite web\n  |url = http://news.cnet.com/8301-13860_3-20020029-56.html\n  |title = Microsoft Office 365 bets on the cloud\n  |work = [[CNET News]]\n  |publisher = [[CBS Interactive]]\n  |date = October 19, 2010\n  |accessdate =October 25, 2010\n  |first = Ina\n  |last = Fried\n  }}\n* {{cite web\n  |url = http://www.cloudhypermarket.com/services/productivity/microsoft-office-365\n  |title = Microsoft unveils Microsoft Office 365\n  |work = Cloud Hypermarket\n  |publisher = Hypermarket Ventures Ltd.\n  |date = October 19, 2010\n  |accessdate =January 24, 2011\n  |first = Andrew\n  |last = Gradwell\n  }}\n* {{cite web\n  |url = http://www.infoworld.com/t/desktop-productivity/what-office-365-says-about-microsoft-736\n  |title = What Office 365 says about Microsoft\n  |work = [[InfoWorld]]\n  |publisher = Infoworld, Inc.\n  |date = October 25, 2010\n  |accessdate =October 25, 2010\n  |first = Eric\n  |last = Knor\n  }}\n* {{cite web\n  |url = http://www.infoworld.com/d/applications/microsoft-unveils-office-365-cloud-platform-146\n  |title = Microsoft unveils Office 365 cloud platform\n  |work = [[InfoWorld]]\n  |publisher = Infoworld, Inc.\n  |date = October 19, 2010\n  |accessdate =October 25, 2010\n  |first = Paul\n  |last = Krill\n  }}\n* {{cite web\n  |url = http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Cloud-Computing/Microsoft-Office-365-Profiled-at-Gartner-Conference-776455/\n  |title = Microsoft Office 365 Profiled at Gartner Conference\n  |work = [[eWeek]]\n  |publisher = Ziff Davis Enterprise Holdings Inc.\n  |date = October 20, 2010\n  |accessdate =October 25, 2010\n  |first = Nicholas\n  |last = Kolakowski\n  }}\n* {{cite web\n  |url = http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Windows/Office-365-Ozzie-Departure-Ballmer-Tablet-Talk-Marked-Microsoft-Week-224674/\n  |title = Office 365, Ozzie Departure, Ballmer Tablet Talk Marked Microsoft Week\n  |work = [[eWeek]]\n  |publisher = Ziff Davis Enterprise Holdings Inc.\n  |date = October 24, 2010\n  |accessdate =October 25, 2010\n  |first = Nicholas\n  |last = Kolakowski\n  }}\n* {{cite web\n  |url = http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9191783/Microsoft_launches_Office_365_makes_cloud_move?source=rss_news\n  |title = Microsoft launches Office 365, makes cloud move\n  |work = [[Computerworld]]\n  |publisher = Computerworld Inc.\n  |date = October 19, 2010\n  |accessdate =October 25, 2010\n  |first = Juan Carlos\n  |last = Perez\n  }}\n* {{cite web\n  |url = https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/19/microsoft-rolls-up-cloud-services-into-office-365-takes-aim-at-google-apps/\n  |title = Microsoft Rolls Up Cloud Services Into Office 365, Takes Aim At Google Apps\n  |work = [[TechCrunch]]\n  |date = October 19, 2010\n  |accessdate =October 25, 2010\n  |first = Jason\n  |last = Kincaid\n  }}\n* {{cite web\n  |url = https://www.zdnet.com/blog/igeneration/microsoft-admits-patriot-act-can-access-eu-based-cloud-data/11225\n  |title = Microsoft admits Patriot Act can access EU-based cloud data\n  |work = ZDNet\n  |date = June 28, 2011\n  |accessdate =August 15, 2011\n  |first = Zack\n  |last = Whittaker\n  }}\n* {{cite web\n  |url = http://www.netzwelt.de/news/87930-anleitung-eigene-domain-microsoft-office-365-konfigurieren.html\n  |title = Adding Domains in Microsoft Office 365\n  |work = Netzwelt\n  |date = August 17, 2011\n  |accessdate =September 12, 2011\n  |first = Markus\n  |last = Franz\n  }}\n* {{cite web\n  |url = http://onlinehelp.microsoft.com/office365-enterprises/ff652556.aspx \n  |title = Prepare for email migration or Exchange hybrid deployment in office 365\n  |work = Netzwelt\n  |date = August 17, 2011\n  |accessdate =September 12, 2011\n  |first = Markus\n  |last = Franz\n  }}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website}}\n\n{{Microsoft}}\n{{Microsoft Office}}\n\n[[Category:Microsoft cloud services]]\n[[Category:Microsoft Office|365]]\n[[Category:Office 365| ]]\n[[Category:Subscription services]]\n", "name_user": "103.244.172.197", "label": "vandal", "comment": "(xxx)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_365"}
