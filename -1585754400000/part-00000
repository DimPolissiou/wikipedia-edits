This insulin secretion subsides as glucose concentrations decrease and approach euglycemia (normal blood glucose level). It also decreases [[glucagon]] secretion in a glucose-dependent manner and delays [[gastric]] emptying. Unlike [[endogenous]] GLP-1, liraglutide is stable against [[metabolic]] degradation by [[peptidase]]s, with a [[Blood plasma|plasma]] half-life of 13 hours.<ref name=\"drugs.com\">https://www.drugs.com/nda/liraglutide_080530.html May 2008</ref><ref name= Goldstein/>\n\n==Pharmacokinetics==\nEndogenous GLP-1 has a [[Blood plasma|plasma]] [[half-life]] of 1.5\u20132 minutes due to degradation by the ubiquitous [[enzymes]], [[dipeptidyl peptidase-4]] (DPP4) and [[neutral endopeptidase]]s (NEP).  The half-life after intramuscular injection is approximately half an hour, so even administered this way, it has limited use as a therapeutic agent.  The metabolically active forms of GLP-1 are the [[endogenous]] GLP-1-(7-36)NH<sub>2</sub> and the more rare GLP-1-(7-37). The prolonged action of liraglutide is achieved by attaching a [[fatty acid]] molecule at one position of the GLP-1-(7-37) molecule, enabling it to both self-associate and bind to [[albumin]] within the [[subcutaneous tissue]] and bloodstream. The active GLP-1 is then released from albumin at a slow, consistent rate. Albumin binding also results in slower degradation and reduced [[renal]] elimination compared to that of GLP-1-(7-37).<ref name= Goldstein/>\n\n==Society and culture==\n\n===Brand names===\nLiraglutide is marketed under the brand name Victoza in the U.S., U.K. UAE, Kuwait, India, Iran, Canada, Europe and Japan.

The FDA and the EMA have not reached a final conclusion at this time regarding such a causal relationship.

This insulin secretion subsides as glucose concentrations decrease and approach euglycemia (normal blood glucose level). It also decreases [[glucagon]] secretion in a glucose-dependent manner and delays [[gastric]] emptying. Unlike [[endogenous]] GLP-1, liraglutide is stable against [[metabolic]] degradation by [[peptidase]]s, with a [[Blood plasma|plasma]] half-life of 13 hours.<ref name=\"drugs.com\">https://www.drugs.com/nda/liraglutide_080530.html May 2008</ref><ref name= Goldstein/>\n\n==Pharmacokinetics==\nEndogenous GLP-1 has a [[Blood plasma|plasma]] [[half-life]] of 1.5\u20132 minutes due to degradation by the ubiquitous [[enzymes]], [[dipeptidyl peptidase-4]] (DPP4) and [[neutral endopeptidase]]s (NEP).  The half-life after intramuscular injection is approximately half an hour, so even administered this way, it has limited use as a therapeutic agent.  The metabolically active forms of GLP-1 are the [[endogenous]] GLP-1-(7-36)NH<sub>2</sub> and the more rare GLP-1-(7-37). The prolonged action of liraglutide is achieved by attaching a [[fatty acid]] molecule at one position of the GLP-1-(7-37) molecule, enabling it to both self-associate and bind to [[albumin]] within the [[subcutaneous tissue]] and bloodstream. The active GLP-1 is then released from albumin at a slow, consistent rate. Albumin binding also results in slower degradation and reduced [[renal]] elimination compared to that of GLP-1-(7-37).<ref name= Goldstein/>\n\n==Society and culture==\n\n===Brand names===\nLiraglutide is marketed under the brand name Victoza in the U.S., U.K. UAE, Kuwait, India, Iran, Canada, Europe and Japan.

The next song, and first single, \"[[Definition (song)|Definition]]\", is a stern response to hip hop's fascination with death, and a dedication to slain emcees [[Tupac Shakur]] and [[The Notorious B.I.G.]]. As the chorus goes, \"One two three/[[Mos Def]] and [[Talib Kweli]]/We came to rock it on to the tip top/Best alliance in hip hop, Y-O/I said, one two three/It's kinda dangerous to be a MC/They shot 2Pac and Biggie/Too much violence in hip hop, Y-O\". The chorus is also a play on [[Boogie Down Productions]]' anti-gun song \"[[Stop the Violence]]\", as well as \"Remix For P Is Free\" from their album [[Criminal Minded]]. \"[[Children's Story]]\" is a re-imagined version of [[Slick Rick]]'s original, which features Mos Def cautioning overly materialistic pursuits.{{cn|date=April 2016}}\n\n\"Brown-Skin Lady\" is an affectionate tribute to brown-skinned women.

The album was released on September 29, 1998, to critical acclaim. The title is a reference to the [[Black Star Line]], a shipping line founded by [[Pan-Africanism|Pan-Africanist]] [[Marcus Garvey]]. The album deals with modern-day issues, philosophical ideas, and life in [[Brooklyn]], New York City as the two artists know it.<ref>{{cite web|last=Moon|first=Tom|title=1000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die|url=http://www.1000recordings.com/music/mos-def-talib-kweli-are-black-star/|publisher=Workman Publishing Company|accessdate=September 26, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111217034612/http://www.1000recordings.com/music/mos-def-talib-kweli-are-black-star/|archive-date=December 17, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nThe album's fruition came about from the chemistry between the two emcees.  Both planned to release their solo albums around the same time, but they postponed their individual projects and decided instead to collaborate on a full-length LP. The album's cover was designed by artist Brent Rollins.<ref>{{cite web |title=Inside The Album Art: Designer Brent Rollins Talks Freeway, Black Star, Spank Rock & More |url=https://www.complex.com/music/2010/02/inside-the-album-art-designer-brent-rollins-talks-freeway-black-star-spank-rock-more |website=complex.com |accessdate=7 March 2020 |date=19 Feb 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Music and lyrics ==\n[[File:Talib kweli-01-mika.jpg|left|thumb|Talib Kweli 1999]]\n\nThe late [[jazz]] musician [[Weldon Irvine]] played the keys on the album's opening song, \"Astronomy,\" which interprets the word \"black\" in a positive way, and contains similes such as \"Black, like my baby girl's hair\". The next song, and first single, \"[[Definition (song)|Definition]]\", is a stern response to hip hop's fascination with death, and a dedication to slain emcees [[Tupac Shakur]] and [[The Notorious B.I.G.]]. As the chorus goes, \"One two three/[[Mos Def]] and [[Talib Kweli]]/We came to rock it on to the tip top/Best alliance in hip hop, Y-O/I said, one two three/It's kinda dangerous to be a MC/They shot 2Pac and Biggie/Too much violence in hip hop, Y-O\". The chorus is also a play on [[Boogie Down Productions]]' anti-gun song \"[[Stop the Violence]]\", as well as \"Remix For P Is Free\" from their album [[Criminal Minded]]. \"[[Children's Story]]\" is a re-imagined version of [[Slick Rick]]'s original, which features Mos Def cautioning overly materialistic pursuits.{{cn|date=April 2016}}\n\n\"Brown-Skin Lady\" is an affectionate tribute to brown-skinned women. The song encourages black and brown women to be proud of their hair and complexion, and to not be influenced by Western beauty standards. Kweli rhymes, \"We're not dealin' with the European standard of beauty tonight/Turn off the TV and put the magazine away/Look in the mirror tell me what you see/I see the evidence of divine presence.\"{{cn|date=April 2016}}\n\n[[File:Mos def-11-mika.jpg|thumb|Mos Def 1999]]\n\"Thieves in the Night\" was inspired by author [[Toni Morrison]]'s novel ''[[The Bluest Eye]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Shields |first1=Michael |title=Twenty Years Later \u2014 Black Star\u2019s Mos Def & Talib Kweli Are Black Star |url=https://acrossthemargin.com/twenty-years-later-black-star/ |website=acrossthemargin.com |accessdate=7 March 2020 |date=27 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Temple |first1=Emily |title=11 Pop Songs for Literary People |url=https://lithub.com/11-pop-songs-for-literary-people/ |website=Literary Hub |accessdate=7 March 2020 |date=26 January 2018}}</ref> In the album's liner notes, Kweli explains that the paragraph \"struck me as one of the truest critiques of our society, and I read that in high school when I was 15 years old. I think it is especially true in the world of hip hop, because we get blinded by these illusions.\" The excerpt interpolated in the song is as follows: \"And fantasy it was, for we were not strong, only aggressive; we were not free, merely licensed; we were not compassionate, we were polite; not good but well-behaved. We courted death in order to call ourselves brave, and hid like thieves from life.\" And the version on the track: \"Not strong, only aggressive/Not free, we only licensed/Not compassionate, only polite (now who the nicest?)/Not good but well-behaved/Chasin' after death so we could call ourselves brave, still livin' like mental slaves/Hiding like thieves in the night from life/Illusions of oasis making you look twice.\"{{cn|date=April 2016}}\n\n== Critical reception ==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref>{{cite web |last=Kaufman |first=Jason |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/black-star-mw0000043603 |title=Black Star \u2013 Black Star / Mos Def / Talib Kweli |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=September 27, 2011}}</ref>\n| rev2 = ''[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]''\n| rev2Score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"Larkin\">{{cite book |title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Encyclopedia of Popular Music]] |last=Larkin |first=Colin |authorlink=Colin Larkin (writer) |publisher=[[Omnibus Press]] |edition=5th concise |year=2011 |isbn=0-85712-595-8}}</ref>\n| rev3 = ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''\n| rev3Score = A\u2212<ref>{{cite journal |last=Diehl |first=Matt |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,285374,00.html |title=Mos Def and Talib Kweli Are Black Star |journal=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |location=New York |date=October 23, 1998 |accessdate=September 27, 2011}}</ref>\n| rev4 = ''[[Muzik]]''\n| rev4Score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite journal |last=McPhail |first=Pete |title=Blackstar: Blackstar (Rawkus) |journal=[[Muzik]] |issue=42 |location=London |date=November 1998 |page=83}}</ref>\n| rev5 = ''[[NME]]''\n| rev5Score = 8/10<ref>{{cite journal |last=Crysell |first=Andy |url=http://www.nme.com:80/reviews/reviews/19980919115701reviews.html |title=Blackstar \u2013 Blackstar |journal=[[NME]] |location=London |date=October 19, 1998 |accessdate=January 17, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000817222724/http://www.nme.com/reviews/reviews/19980919115701reviews.html |archivedate=August 17, 2000 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n| rev6 = ''[[Rolling Stone]]''\n| rev6Score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref>{{cite journal |last=Powell |first=Kevin |authorlink=Kevin Powell |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/blackstar/albums/album/162843/review/5943898/black_star |title=Black Star: Black Star |journal=[[Rolling Stone]] |location=New York |date=October 7, 1998 |accessdate=April 9, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080401202339/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/blackstar/albums/album/162843/review/5943898/black_star |archivedate=April 1, 2008}}</ref>\n| rev7 = ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]''\n| rev7Score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite book |chapter=Mos Def |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lRgtYCC6OUwC&pg=PA562 |accessdate=September 27, 2011 |last=Relic |first=Peter |title=[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide|The New Rolling Stone Album Guide]] |year=2004 |publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]] |edition=4th |editor1-last=Brackett |editor1-first=Nathan |editor2-last=Hoard |editor2-first=Christian |isbn=0-7432-0169-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/newrollingstonea00brac/page/562 562] }}</ref>\n| rev8 = ''[[The Source]]''\n| rev8Score = 3.5/5<ref>{{cite journal |title=Black Star: Mos Def & Talib Kweli Are Black Star |journal=[[The Source]] |issue=110 |location=New York |date=November 1998 |page=198}}</ref>\n| rev9 = ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''\n| rev9Score = 10/10<ref name=\"Aaron\">{{cite journal |last=Aaron |first=Charles |authorlink=Charles Aaron |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xGaz0_gZPzIC&pg=PA80 |title=Mos Def |journal=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |volume=25 |issue=8 |location=New York |date=August 2009 |accessdate=April 9, 2016 |page=80}}</ref>\n| rev10 = ''[[The Village Voice]]''\n| rev10Score = A\u2212<ref name=\"VV\">{{cite news |last=Christgau |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Christgau |url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/cg/cgv1098-98.php |title=Consumer Guide |newspaper=[[The Village Voice]] |location=New York |date=November 3, 1998 |accessdate=September 27, 2011}}</ref>\n}}\n''Black Star'' was voted the 24th best album of 1998 in the [[Pazz & Jop]], a poll of American critics nationwide published annually by ''[[The Village Voice]]''.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/pnj/pjres98.php |title=The 1998 Pazz & Jop Critics Poll |newspaper=[[The Village Voice]] |location=New York |date=March 2, 1999 |accessdate=September 27, 2011}}</ref> [[Robert Christgau]], the poll's creator, wrote in a contemporary review that Mos Def and Talib Kweli \"devise a hip hop imaginary where hater players lose their girls-not-bitches to MCs so disinterested they give 'em right back.

[[Native American cultures in the United States|Numerous indigenous cultures]] formed, and many disappeared before 1500. The arrival of [[Christopher Columbus]] in the year 1492 started the [[European colonization of the Americas]]. Most colonies were formed after 1600, and the early records and writings of [[John Winthrop]] make the [[United States]] the first nation whose most distant origins are fully recorded.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A history of the American people|last=Johnson, Paul, 1928\u2013|date=1999|publisher=HarperPerennial|isbn=0060930349|edition= 1st HarperPerennial |location=New York, NY|pages=32|oclc=40984521|quote=These early diaries and letters, which are plentiful, and the fact that most important documents about the early American colonies have been preserved, mean that the United States is the first nation in human history whose most distant origins are fully recorded.}}</ref> By the 1760s, the [[Thirteen Colonies|thirteen British colonies]] contained 2.5 million people along the [[East Coast of the United States|Atlantic Coast]] east of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. After [[French and Indian Wars|defeating France]], the British government imposed a series of taxes, including the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act of 1765]], rejecting the colonists' constitutional argument that new taxes needed their approval. Resistance to these taxes, especially the [[Boston Tea Party]] in 1773, led to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] issuing [[Intolerable Acts|punitive laws]] designed to end self-government in Massachusetts.\n\nArmed conflict began in 1775. In 1776, in Philadelphia, the [[Second Continental Congress]] [[United States Declaration of Independence|declared the independence]] of the colonies as the United States. Led by General [[George Washington]], it won the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] with large support from France. The [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|peace treaty of 1783]] gave the land east of the Mississippi River (except Canada and Florida) to the new nation. The [[Articles of Confederation]] established a central government, but it was ineffectual at providing stability as it could not collect taxes and had no executive officer. A [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|convention]] in 1787 wrote [[Constitution of the United States|a new Constitution]] that was adopted in 1789. In 1791, a [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] was added to guarantee [[Natural rights and legal rights|inalienable rights]]. With Washington as the first president and [[Alexander Hamilton]] his chief adviser, a strong central government was created. [[Louisiana Purchase|Purchase]] of the [[Louisiana Territory]] from France in 1803 doubled the size of the United States. A second and final war with Britain was [[War of 1812|fought in 1812]], which solidified national pride.\n\nEncouraged by the notion of [[manifest destiny]], U.S. territory expanded [[American frontier|all the way]] to the [[West Coast of the United States|Pacific Coast]]. While the United States was large in terms of area, by 1790 [[Demography of the United States|its population]] was only 4 million. It grew rapidly, however, reaching 7.2 million in 1810, 32 million in 1860, 76 million in 1900, 132 million in 1940, and 321 million in 2015. Economic growth in terms of overall [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] was even greater. Compared to European powers, though, the nation's military strength was relatively limited in peacetime before 1940. [[American frontier|Westward expansion]] was driven by a quest for inexpensive land for [[yeoman]] farmers and slave owners. The expansion of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] was increasingly controversial and fueled political and constitutional battles, which were resolved by compromises. Slavery was abolished in all states [[Northern United States|north]] of the [[Mason\u2013Dixon line]] by 1804, but the [[Southern United States|South]] continued to profit from the institution, mostly from the [[Cotton production in the United States|production of cotton]]. [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] was [[1860 United States presidential election|elected president in 1860]] on a platform of halting the expansion of slavery.\n\nSeven Southern slave states rebelled and created the foundation of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. Its [[Battle of Fort Sumter|attack of Fort Sumter]] against the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union forces]] there in 1861 started the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Defeat of the Confederates in 1865 led to the impoverishment of the South and the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|abolition of slavery]]. In the [[Reconstruction era]] following the war, [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|legal and voting rights were extended]] to [[Freedman|freed slaves]]. The national government emerged much stronger, and because of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] in 1868, it gained explicit duty to protect individual rights. However, when white [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] regained their power in the South in 1877, often by [[paramilitary]] [[Voter suppression in the United States|suppression of voting]], they passed [[Jim Crow laws]] to maintain [[white supremacy]], as well as new [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchising]] [[State constitution (United States)|state constitutions]] that prevented most [[African Americans]] and many [[Poor White|poor whites]] from voting. This continued until the gains of the [[civil rights movement]] in the 1960s and the passage of federal legislation to enforce constitutional rights.\n\nThe United States became the world's leading industrial power at the turn of the 20th century, due to an outburst of entrepreneurship and industrialization in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] and [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] and the arrival of [[European emigration|millions of immigrant workers and farmers from Europe]]. The national railroad network was completed and large-scale mines and factories were established. Mass dissatisfaction with corruption, inefficiency, and traditional politics stimulated the [[Progressive Era|Progressive movement]], from the 1890s to 1920s. This era led to many reforms, including the Sixteenth to Nineteenth constitutional amendments, which brought the federal income tax, direct election of Senators, [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]], and [[Women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage]]. Initially neutral during [[World War I]], the United States [[American entry into World War I|declared war on Germany]] in 1917 and funded the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] victory the following year. Women obtained the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|right to vote]] in 1920, with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] obtaining citizenship and the right to vote in 1924.\n\nAfter [[Roaring Twenties|a prosperous decade]] in the 1920s, the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] marked the onset of the decade-long worldwide [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]]. Democratic President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] ended the Republican dominance of the [[White House]] and implemented his [[New Deal]] programs, which included relief for the unemployed, support for farmers, [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and a [[Minimum wage in the United States|minimum wage]]. The New Deal defined [[Modern liberalism in the United States|modern American liberalism]]. After the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]] in 1941, the United States entered [[World War II]] and financed the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] war effort and helped defeat [[Nazi Germany]] in the [[European theatre of World War II|European theater]]. Its involvement culminated in using newly-invented [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|nuclear weapons on two Japanese cities]] to defeat [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan]] in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theater]].\n\nThe United States and the [[Soviet Union]] emerged as rival superpowers in the [[aftermath of World War II]]. During the [[Cold War]], the two countries confronted each other indirectly in the [[arms race]], the [[Space Race]], [[proxy war]]s, and propaganda campaigns. The goal of the United States in this was to stop the spread of [[communism]]. In the 1960s, in large part due to the strength of the [[civil rights movement]], another wave of social reforms was enacted which enforced the constitutional rights of voting and freedom of movement to African Americans and other racial minorities. The Cold War ended when the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union was officially dissolved]] in 1991, leaving the United States as the world's only superpower.\n\nAfter the Cold War, the United States has been focusing on [[List of modern conflicts in the Middle East|modern conflicts in the Middle East]]. The beginning of the 21st century saw the [[September 11 attacks]] carried out by [[Al-Qaeda]] in 2001, which was later followed by wars in [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq War|Iraq]]. In 2007, the United States entered its [[Great Recession in the United States|worst economic crisis since the Great Depression]], which was followed by slower-than-usual rates of economic growth during the early 2010s. However, in the late 2010s and early 2020s, economic growth increased significantly.\n\n==Early America==\n{{Main|Prehistory of the United States|History of Native Americans in the United States|Pre-Columbian era}}\n{{See also|Native Americans in the United States}}\n[[File:Peopling of America through Beringia.png|thumb|200px|This map shows the approximate location of the ice-free corridor and specific Paleoindian sites ([[Clovis theory]]).]]\nIt is not definitively known how or when Native Americans first [[Settlement of the Americas|settled the Americas]] and the present-day United States. The prevailing theory proposes that people from [[Eurasia]] followed [[Game (hunting)|game]] across [[Beringia]], a [[land bridge]] that connected [[Siberia]] to present-day [[Alaska]] during the [[Last Glacial Period|Ice Age]], and then spread southward throughout the Americas. This migration may have begun as early as 30,000 years ago<ref>{{cite news |title=New Ideas About Human Migration From Asia To Americas |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/10/071025160653.htm |work=ScienceDaily |date=October 29, 2007 |accessdate=March 12, 2011}}</ref> and continued through to about 10,000 years ago, when the land bridge became submerged by the rising sea level caused by the melting glaciers.<ref>{{harvnb|Kennedy|Cohen|Bailey|2006|p=6}}</ref> These early inhabitants, called [[Paleo-Indians]], soon diversified into hundreds of culturally distinct nations and tribes.\n\nThis [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] era incorporates all [[archaeology of the Americas|periods]] in the [[history of the Americas]] before the appearance of European influences on the American continents, spanning from the [[Settlement of the Americas|original settlement]] in the [[Upper Paleolithic]] period to [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonization]] during the [[early modern period]]. While the term technically refers to the era before [[Christopher Columbus]]' voyage in 1492, in practice the term usually includes the history of [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|American indigenous cultures]] until they were conquered or significantly influenced by Europeans, even if this happened decades or centuries after Columbus's initial landing.\n\n===Paleo-Indians===\n[[File:North American cultural areas.png|thumb|200px|left|The [[Cultural area]]s of [[pre-Columbian North America]], according to [[Alfred Kroeber]].]]\nBy 10,000 BCE, humans were relatively well-established throughout [[North America]]. Originally, Paleo-Indian hunted Ice Age [[megafauna]] like [[mammoth]]s, but as they began to go extinct, people turned instead to [[bison]] as a food source. As time went on, foraging for berries and seeds became an important alternative to hunting. Paleo-Indians in central Mexico were the first in the Americas to farm, starting to plant corn, beans, and squash around 8,000 BCE. Eventually, the knowledge began to spread northward. By 3,000 BCE, corn was being grown in the valleys of [[Arizona]] and [[New Mexico]], followed by primitive [[irrigation]] systems and early villages of the [[Hohokam]].<ref name=\":6\"/><ref name=\"mark\">Chenault, Mark, Rick Ahlstrom, and Tom Motsinger, (1993) ''In the Shadow of South Mountain: The Pre-Classic Hohokam of 'La Ciudad de los Hornos{{'}}'', Part I and II.</ref>\n\nOne of the earliest cultures in the present-day United States was the [[Clovis culture]], who are primarily identified by the use of fluted [[spear]] points called the [[Clovis point]]. From 9,100 to 8,850 BCE, the culture ranged over much of North America and also appeared in South America. Artifacts from this culture were first excavated in 1932 near [[Clovis, New Mexico]]. The [[Folsom tradition|Folsom culture]] was similar, but is marked by the use of the [[Folsom point]].\n\nA later migration identified by linguists, anthropologists, and archeologists occurred around 8,000 BCE. This included [[Na-Dene languages|Na-Dene]]-speaking peoples, who reached the [[Pacific Northwest]] by 5,000 BCE.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 670070|title = Toward a Prehistory of the Na-Dene, with a General Comment on Population Movements among Nomadic Hunters|journal = American Anthropologist|volume = 71|issue = 5|pages = 857\u2013863|last1 = Dumond|first1 = D.

They are the earliest known people to have been [[Mound Builders|mound builders]], however, there are mounds in the United States that predate this culture. [[Watson Brake]] is an 11-mound complex in [[Louisiana]] that dates to 3,500 BCE, and nearby [[Poverty Point]], built by the [[Poverty Point culture]], is an earthwork complex that dates to 1,700 BCE. These mounds likely served a religious purpose.\n\nThe Adenans were absorbed into the [[Hopewell tradition]], a powerful people who traded tools and goods across a wide territory. They continued the Adena tradition of mound-building, with remnants of several thousand still in existence across the core of their former territory in southern [[Ohio]]. The Hopewell pioneered a trading system called the Hopewell Exchange System, which at its greatest extent ran from the present-day Southeast up to the Canadian side of [[Lake Ontario]].<ref name=\":8\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=1283|title=Hopewell|publisher=Ohio History Central}}</ref> By 500 CE, the Hopewellians had too disappeared, absorbed into the larger [[Mississippian culture]].\n\nThe Mississippians were a broad group of tribes. Their most important city was [[Cahokia]], near modern-day [[St. Louis|St. Louis, Missouri]]. At its peak in the 12th century, the city had an estimated population of 20,000, larger than the population of London at the time. The entire city was centered around a [[Monks Mound|mound]] that stood {{Convert|100|ft|m|abbr=}} tall. Cahokia, like many other cities and villages of the time, depended on hunting, foraging, trading, and agriculture, and developed a class system with slaves and human sacrifice that was influenced by societies to the south, like the [[Maya peoples|Mayans]].<ref name=\":6\"/>\n\nIn the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]], the [[Ancestral Puebloans|Anasazi]] began constructing stone and adobe pueblos around 900 BCE.<ref name=\"eb\">[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/22804/Ancestral-Pueblo-culture \"Ancestral Pueblo culture.\"] ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica.''

Many distinct cultural and political nations developed there, but they all shared certain beliefs traditions, and practices, such as the centrality of [[salmon]] as a resource and spiritual symbol. Permanent villages began to develop in this region as early as 1,000 BCE, and these communities celebrated by the gift-giving feast of the [[potlatch]]. These gatherings were usually organized to commemorate special events such as the raising of a [[Totem pole]] of the celebration of a new chief.\n\nIn present-day [[Upstate New York|upstate]] [[New York (state)|New York]], the [[Iroquois]] formed a [[Confederation|confederacy]] of tribal nations in the mid-15th&nbsp;century, consisting of the [[Oneida Indian Nation|Oneida]], [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]], [[Onondaga people|Onondaga]], [[Cayuga people|Cayuga]], and [[Seneca people|Seneca]].

In 1565, Spanish forces led by [[Pedro Men\u00e9ndez de Avil\u00e9s|Pedro Men\u00e9ndez]] destroyed the settlement and established the first European settlement in what would become the United States \u2014 [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]].\n\nAfter this, the French mostly remained in [[Quebec]] and [[Acadia]], but far-reaching trade relationships with Native Americans throughout the Great Lakes and Midwest spread their influence. French colonists in small villages along the Mississippi and [[Illinois River|Illinois]] rivers lived in farming communities that served as a grain source for Gulf Coast settlements. The French established plantations in Louisiana along with settling [[New Orleans]], [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] and [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]].\n\n=== British colonies ===\n{{Further|British colonization of the Americas}}\n[[File:Descriptionofnewengland 2 smith 64kb.ogg|thumb|Excerpt of a ''Description of New England'' by English explorer [[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith]], published in 1616.]]\n\n[[File:MayflowerHarbor.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The ''[[Mayflower]]'', which transported [[Pilgrim (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]] to the New World.

The first British colony in North America was established at [[Roanoke Colony|Roanoke]] by [[Walter Raleigh]] in 1585, but failed. It would be twenty years before another attempt.<ref name=\":6\"/>\n\nThe early British colonies were established by private groups seeking profit, and were marked by starvation, disease, and Native American attacks. Many immigrants were people seeking religious freedom or escaping political oppression, peasants displaced by the Industrial Revolution, or those simply seeking adventure and opportunity.\n\nIn some areas, Native Americans taught colonists how to plant and harvest the native crops. In others, they attacked the settlers. Virgin forests provided an ample supply of building material and firewood. Natural inlets and harbors lined the coast, providing easy ports for essential trade with Europe. Settlements remained close to the coast due to this as well as Native American resistance and the Appalachian Mountains that were found in the interior.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n==== The first settlement: Jamestown ====\n[[Image:Squantoteaching.png|thumb|200px|[[Squanto]] known for having been an early liaison between the native populations in Southern New England and the ''Mayflower'' settlers, who made their settlement at the site of Squanto's former summer village.]]\n\nThe first successful English colony, [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], was established by the [[London Company|Virginia Company]] in 1607 on the [[James River]] in [[Virginia]]. The colonists were preoccupied with the search for gold and were ill-equipped for life in the New World. Captain [[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith]] held the fledgling Jamestown together in the first year, and the colony descended into anarchy and nearly failed when he returned to England two years later. [[John Rolfe]] began experimenting with tobacco from the West Indies in 1612, and by 1614 the first shipment arrived in London. It became Virginia's chief source of revenue within a decade.\n\nIn 1624, after years of disease and Indian attacks, including the [[Powhatan attack of 1622]], [[James VI and I|King James I]] revoked the Virginia Company's charter and made Virginia a royal colony.\n\n==== New England ====\n[[File:Thanksgiving-Brownscombe.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Jennie Augusta Brownscombe]], ''The First Thanksgiving at Plymouth'', 1914, Pilgrim Hall Museum, Plymouth, Massachusetts]]\n\n[[New England]] was initially settled primarily by [[Puritans]] fleeing religious persecution. The [[Pilgrims (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]] sailed for Virginia on the Mayflower in 1620, but were knocked off course by a storm and landed at [[Plymouth Colony|Plymouth]], where they agreed to a social contract of rules in the [[Mayflower Compact]]. Like Jamestown, Plymouth suffered from disease and starvation, but local [[Wampanoag]] Indians taught the colonists how to farm maize.\n\nPlymouth was followed by the [[Puritans]] and [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] in 1630. They maintained a charter for self-government separate from England, and elected founder [[John Winthrop]] as the governor for most of its early years. [[Roger Williams]] opposed Winthrop's treatment of Native Americans and religious intolerance, and established the colony of [[Providence Plantations]], later [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]], on the basis of freedom of religion. Other colonists established settlements in the [[Connecticut River]] Valley, and on the coasts of present-day [[New Hampshire]] and [[Maine]]. Native American attacks continued, with the most significant occurring in the 1637 [[Pequot War]] and the 1675 [[King Philip's War]].\n\nNew England became a center of commerce and industry due to the poor, mountainous soil making agriculture difficult. Rivers were harnessed to power grain mills and sawmills, and the numerous harbors facilitated trade. Tight-knit villages developed around these industrial centers, and [[Boston]] became one of America's most important ports.\n\n==== Middle Colonies ====\n[[File:Indians_at_a_Hudson_Bay_Company_trading_post.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Indians trade 90-lb packs of furs at a Hudson's Bay Company trading post in the 19th century.]]\n\nIn the 1660s, the [[Middle Colonies]] of [[Province of New York|New York]], [[Province of New Jersey|New Jersey]], and [[History of Delaware|Delaware]] were established in the former Dutch New Netherland, and were characterized by a large degree of ethnic and religious diversity. At the same time, the [[Iroquois]] of New York, strengthened by years of fur trading with Europeans, formed the powerful Iroquois Confederacy.\n\nThe last colony in this region was [[Province of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]], established in 1681 by [[William Penn]] as a home for religious dissenters, including [[Quakers]], [[Methodism|Methodists]], and the [[Amish]].<ref name=\":9\" /> The capital of colony, [[Philadelphia]], became a dominant commercial center in a few short years, with busy docks and brick houses. While Quakers populated the city, [[German Americans|German]] immigrants began to flood into the Pennsylvanian hills and forests, while the [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scots-Irish]] pushed into the far western frontier.\n\n==== Southern Colonies ====\nThe extremely rural [[Southern Colonies]] contrasted greatly with the north. Outside of Virginia, the first British colony south of New England was [[Province of Maryland|Maryland]], established as a Catholic haven in 1632. The economy of these two colonies was built entirely on [[yeoman]] farmers and planters. The planters established themselves in the [[Tidewater (region)|Tidewater]] region of Virginia, establishing massive [[Plantations in the American South|plantations]] with slave labor, while the small-scale farmers made their way into political office.\n\nIn 1670, the [[Province of Carolina]] was established, and [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] became the region's great trading port. While Virginia's economy was based on tobacco, Carolina was much more diversified, exporting rice, indigo, and lumber as well. In 1712 the colony was split in half, creating [[Province of North Carolina|North]] and [[Province of South Carolina|South Carolina]]. The [[Province of Georgia|Georgia Colony]]&nbsp;\u2013 the last of the Thirteen Colonies&nbsp;\u2013 was established by [[James Oglethorpe]] in 1732 as a border to Spanish Florida and a reform colony for former prisoners and the poor.<ref name=\":9\">Richard Middleton and Anne Lombard ''Colonial America: A History to 1763'' (4th ed. 2011)</ref>\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\u201d>\n1622 massacre jamestown de Bry.jpg|The [[Indian massacre of 1622|Indian massacre of Jamestown settlers]] in 1622.

American [[Evangelicalism|Evangelicals]] affected by the Awakening added a new emphasis on divine outpourings of the Holy Spirit and conversions that implanted new believers with an intense love for God. Revivals encapsulated those hallmarks and carried the newly created evangelicalism into the early republic, setting the stage for the [[Second Great Awakening]] in the late 1790s.<ref>Thomas S. Kidd, ''The Great Awakening: The Roots of Evangelical Christianity in Colonial America'' (2009)</ref> In the early stages, evangelicals in the South, such as [[Methodism|Methodists]] and [[Baptists in the United States|Baptists]], preached for religious freedom and abolition of slavery; they converted many slaves and recognized some as preachers.\n\n==== Government ====\nEach of the 13 American colonies had a slightly different governmental structure. Typically, a colony was ruled by a governor appointed from London who controlled the executive administration and relied upon a locally elected legislature to vote on taxes and make laws. By the 18th century, the American colonies were growing very rapidly as a result of low death rates along with ample supplies of land and food. The colonies were richer than most parts of Britain, and attracted a steady flow of immigrants, especially teenagers who arrived as indentured servants.<ref name=\"Max Savelle 2005 185\u201390\">{{cite book |author=Max Savelle|title=Seeds of Liberty: The Genesis of the American Mind|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hIgl_HNozQsC&pg=PA185|origyear=1948|year=2005|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|pages=185\u201390|isbn=9781419107078}}</ref>\n\n==== Servitude and slavery ====\nOver half of all European immigrants to Colonial America arrived as [[Indentured servitude|indentured servants]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/nai_cilh/servitude.html|title=Indentured Servitude in Colonial America|last=Barker|first=Deanna|publisher=National Association for Interpretation, Cultural Interpretation and Living History Section|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091022161033/http://geocities.com/nai_cilh/servitude.html|archivedate=October 22, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Few could afford the cost of the journey to America, and so this form of unfree labor provided a means to immigrate. Typically, people would sign a contract agreeing to a set term of labor, usually four to seven years, and in return would receive transport to America and a piece of land at the end of their servitude. In some cases, ships' captains received rewards for the delivery of poor migrants, and so extravagant promises and kidnapping were common. The Virginia Company and the Massachusetts Bay Company also utilized indentured servant labor.<ref name=\":6\"/>\n\nThe first [[Slavery in the United States|African slaves]] were brought to Virginia from the British West Indies in 1619, just twelve years after the founding of Jamestown. Initially regarded as indentured servants who could buy their freedom, the institution of slavery began to harden and the involuntary servitude became lifelong as the demand for labor on tobacco and rice plantations grew in the 1660s. Slavery became identified with brown skin color, at the time seen as a \"[[black race]]\", and the children of slave women were born slaves (''[[partus sequitur ventrem]]''). By the 1770s African slaves comprised a fifth of the American population.\n\nThe question of independence from Britain did not arise as long as the colonies needed British military support against the French and Spanish powers. Those threats were gone by 1765. London, however, continued to regard the American colonies as existing for the benefit of the mother country in a policy known as [[mercantilism]].<ref name=\"Max Savelle 2005 185\u201390\" />\n\nColonial America was defined by a severe labor shortage that utilized forms of [[Unfree labour|unfree labor]], such as [[Slavery in the colonial United States|slavery]] and [[indentured servitude]].The British colonies were also marked by a policy of avoiding strict enforcement of parliamentary laws, known as [[salutary neglect]]. This permitted the development of an American spirit distinct from that of its European founders.<ref name=\"history of colonial2\">{{cite encyclopedia|last=Henretta|first=James A.|title=History of Colonial America|url=http://encarta.msn.com/text_1741502191___0/History_of_Colonial_America.html|encyclopedia=Encarta Online Encyclopedia|year=2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923141733/http://encarta.msn.com/text_1741502191___0/History_of_Colonial_America.html|archivedate=September 23, 2009|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Road to independence==\n[[File:Nouvelle-France map-en.svg|thumb|Map of the [[British colonization of the Americas|British]] and [[New France|French]] settlements in North America in 1750, before the [[French and Indian War]]]]\nAn upper-class emerged in South Carolina and Virginia, with wealth based on large plantations operated by slave labor. A unique class system operated in [[upstate New York]], where Dutch tenant farmers rented land from very wealthy Dutch proprietors, such as the [[Van Rensselaer (family)|Van Rensselaer family]]. The other colonies were more egalitarian, with Pennsylvania being representative. By the mid-18th century Pennsylvania was basically a middle-class colony with limited respect for its small upper-class. A writer in the ''Pennsylvania Journal'' in 1756 summed it up:\n<blockquote>The People of this Province are generally of the middling Sort, and at present pretty much upon a Level. They are chiefly industrious Farmers, Artificers or Men in Trade; they enjoy in are fond of Freedom, and the ''meanest among them'' thinks he has a right to Civility from the greatest.<ref>Clinton Rossiter, ''Seedtime of the Republic: the origin of the American tradition of political liberty'' (1953) p 106.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n===Political integration and autonomy===\n[[File:Benjamin Franklin - Join or Die.jpg|thumb|''[[Join, or Die]]'': This 1756 political cartoon by [[Benjamin Franklin]] urged the colonies to join together during the French and Indian War.]]\nThe [[French and Indian War]] (1754\u201363), part of the larger [[Seven Years' War]], was a watershed event in the political development of the colonies. The influence of the French and Native Americans, the main rivals of the [[The Crown|British Crown]] in the colonies and Canada, was significantly reduced and the territory of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] expanded into [[New France]], both in Canada and [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]]. The war effort also resulted in greater political integration of the colonies, as reflected in the [[Albany Congress]] and symbolized by [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s call for the colonies to \"[[Join, or Die]]\". Franklin was a man of many inventions&nbsp;\u2013 one of which was the concept of a United States of America, which emerged after 1765 and would be realized a decade later.<ref>{{cite book |author=H.W.

In the following years, strains developed in the relations between the colonists and the Crown. The [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]] passed the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act of 1765]], imposing a tax on the colonies, without going through the colonial legislatures. The issue was drawn: did Parliament have the right to tax Americans who were not represented in it? Crying \"[[No taxation without representation]]\", the colonists refused to pay the taxes as tensions escalated in the late 1760s and early 1770s.<ref>{{cite book |author=Edmund S.

Parliament quickly responded the next year with the [[Intolerable Acts]], stripping Massachusetts of its historic right of self-government and putting it under military rule, which sparked outrage and resistance in all thirteen colonies. [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] leaders from every colony convened the [[First Continental Congress]] to coordinate their resistance to the Intolerable Acts. The Congress called for a [[Continental Association|boycott of British trade]], published a [[Declaration and Resolves of the First Continental Congress|list of rights and grievances]], and [[Petition to the King|petitioned the king]] to rectify those grievances.<ref>{{cite book |author=Robert Allison|title=The Boston Tea Party|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D6x7Cmio5hoC|year=2007|publisher=Applewood Books|pages=47\u201363|isbn=9781933212111}}</ref> This appeal to the Crown had no effect, though, and so the [[Second Continental Congress]] was convened in 1775 to organize the defense of the colonies against the British Army.\n\nCommon people became insurgents against the British even though they were unfamiliar with the ideological rationales being offered. They held very strongly a sense of \"rights\" that they felt the British were deliberately violating&nbsp;\u2013 rights that stressed local autonomy, fair dealing, and government by consent. They were highly sensitive to the issue of tyranny, which they saw manifested by the arrival in Boston of the British Army to punish the Bostonians. This heightened their sense of violated rights, leading to rage and demands for revenge, and they had faith that God was on their side.<ref>Mark Edward Lender, review of ''American Insurgents, American Patriots: The Revolution of the People'' (2010) by T.

In the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775\u201383) the Americans captured the British invasion army at [[Battles of Saratoga|Saratoga in 1777]], secured the Northeast and encouraged the French to make a military alliance with the United States.

His biggest challenge was logistics,  since neither Congress nor the states had the funding to provide adequately for the equipment, munitions, clothing, paychecks, or even the food supply of the soldiers.\n\nAs a battlefield tactician, Washington was often outmaneuvered by his British counterparts. As a strategist, however, he had a better idea of how to win the war than they did. The British sent four invasion armies. Washington's strategy forced the first army out of Boston in 1776, and was responsible for the surrender of the second and third armies at Saratoga (1777) and Yorktown (1781). He limited the British control to New York City and a few places while keeping Patriot control of the great majority of the population.<ref name=\"NEH EDSITEMENT\">Lesson Plan on \"What Made George Washington a Good Military Leader?\" [http://edsitement.neh.gov/curriculum-unit/what-made-george-washington-good-military-leader NEH EDSITEMENT]</ref>\n\n=== Loyalists and Britain ===\n[[File:Declaration of Independence (1819), by John Trumbull.jpg|thumb|[[John Trumbull]]'s ''[[Declaration of Independence (Trumbull)|Declaration of Independence]]'' (1819)]]\nThe Loyalists, whom the British counted upon too heavily, comprised about 20% of the population but never were well organized.

With the migration of settlers to the Northwest, soon they became states.

A compromise gave the South Congressional apportionment out of proportion to its free population by allowing it to include three-fifths of the number of slaves in each state's total population. This provision increased the political power of southern representatives in Congress, especially as slavery was extended into the Deep South through removal of Native Americans and transportation of slaves by an extensive domestic trade.\n\nTo assuage the Anti-Federalists who feared a too-powerful national government, the nation adopted the [[United States Bill of Rights]] in 1791. Comprising the first ten amendments of the Constitution, it guaranteed individual liberties such as freedom of speech and religious practice, jury trials, and stated that citizens and states had reserved rights (which were not specified).<ref>Richard Labunski, ''James Madison and the Struggle for the Bill of Rights'' (2008)</ref>\n\n===President George Washington===\n\n[[File:Stuart-george-washington-constable-1797.jpg|thumb|left|[[George Washington]] legacy remains among the two or three greatest in American history, as Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army, hero of the Revolution, and the first President of the United States.]]\n[[File:Farewelladdresses 01 various 128kb.ogg|thumb|Reading of the [[George Washington's Farewell Address|Farewell address]] of President George Washington, 1796]]\n\n[[George Washington]]&nbsp;\u2013 a renowned hero of the [[American Revolutionary War]], commander-in-chief of the [[Continental Army]], and president of the [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]]&nbsp;\u2013 became the first President of the United States under the new [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] in 1789.

Inspired by revolutionary ideals of the equality of men and influenced by their lesser economic reliance on slavery, northern states abolished slavery.\n\nStates of the [[Upper South]] made [[manumission]] easier, resulting in an increase in the proportion of [[Free negro|free blacks]] in the Upper South (as a percentage of the total non-white population) from less than one percent in 1792 to more than 10 percent by 1810.

The former Jeffersonian (Democratic-Republican) party split into factions. They split over the choice of a successor to President [[James Monroe]], and the party faction that supported many of the old Jeffersonian principles, led by [[Andrew Jackson]] and [[Martin Van Buren]], became the Democratic Party. As Norton explains the transformation in 1828:\n<blockquote>Jacksonians believed the people's will had finally prevailed. Through a lavishly financed coalition of state parties, political leaders, and newspaper editors, a popular movement had elected the president. The Democrats became the nation's first well-organized national party, and tight party organization became the hallmark of nineteenth-century American politics.<ref>Mary Beth Norton et al., ''A People and a Nation, Volume I: to 1877'' (Houghton Mifflin, 2007) p 287</ref></blockquote>\n\nOpposing factions led by [[Henry Clay]] helped form the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]]. The Democratic Party had a small but decisive advantage over the Whigs until the 1850s, when the Whigs fell apart over the issue of slavery.\n\nBehind the platforms issued by state and national parties stood a widely shared political outlook that characterized the Democrats:\n\n[[File:Clay44b.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Horace Greeley]]'s ''New York Tribune''\u2014the leading Whig paper\u2014endorsed Clay for President and Fillmore for Governor, 1844.]]\n<blockquote>The Democrats represented a wide range of views but shared a fundamental commitment to the Jeffersonian concept of an agrarian society. They viewed the central government as the enemy of individual liberty. The 1824 \"corrupt bargain\" had strengthened their suspicion of Washington politics.&nbsp;... Jacksonians feared the concentration of economic and political power. They believed that government intervention in the economy benefited special-interest groups and created corporate monopolies that favored the rich. They sought to restore the independence of the individual (the \"common man,\" i.e. the artisan and the ordinary farmer) by ending federal support of banks and corporations and restricting the use of paper currency, which they distrusted. Their definition of the proper role of government tended to be negative, and Jackson's political power was largely expressed in negative acts. He exercised the veto more than all previous presidents combined. Jackson and his supporters also opposed reform as a movement. Reformers eager to turn their programs into legislation called for a more active government. But Democrats tended to oppose programs like educational reform mid the establishment of a public education system. They believed, for instance, that public schools restricted individual liberty by interfering with parental responsibility and undermined freedom of religion by replacing church schools. Nor did Jackson share reformers' humanitarian concerns. He had no sympathy for American Indians, initiating the removal of the Cherokees along the Trail of Tears.<ref>Mary Beth Norton et al., ''A People and a Nation, Volume I: to 1877'' (2007) pp 287\u201388</ref><ref>Robert Allen Rutland, ''The Democrats: From Jefferson to Clinton'' (U. of Missouri Press, 1995) ch 1\u20134</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe great majority of anti-slavery activists, such as Abraham Lincoln and Mr. Walters, rejected [[William_Lloyd_Garrison|Garrison's]] theology and held that slavery was an unfortunate social evil, not a sin.<ref>{{cite book |author=James Oakes|title=The Radical and the Republican: Frederick Douglass, Abraham Lincoln, and the Triumph of Antislavery Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rK0ThVhgcbAC&pg=PA57|year=2008|publisher=W.

Enormous popular attention in the media focuses on the \"Wild West\" of the second half of the 19th century.

Much larger numbers in the North were against the expansion of slavery, seeking to put it on the path to extinction so that America would be committed to free land (as in low-cost farms owned and cultivated by a family), free labor, and free speech (as opposed to censorship of abolitionist material in the South). Southern whites insisted that slavery was of economic, social, and cultural benefit to all whites (and even to the slaves themselves), and denounced all anti-slavery spokesmen as \"abolitionists\".<ref>Jeff Forret, ''Slavery in the United States'' (Facts on File, 2012)</ref> Justifications of slavery included economics, history, religion, legality, social good, and even humanitarianism, to further their arguments.

The [[Plantations in the American South|plantations]] were highly profitable, due to the heavy European demand for raw cotton. Most of the profits were invested in new lands and in purchasing more slaves (largely drawn from the declining [[tobacco]] regions).\n\n[[File:National-atlas-1970-1860.png|right|thumb|300px|The United States, immediately before the Civil War.

The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 required the states to cooperate with slave owners when attempting to recover escaped slaves, which outraged Northerners. Formerly, an escaped slave that reached a non-slave state was presumed to have attained sanctuary and freedom under the [[Missouri Compromise]]. The Supreme Court's 1857 decision in ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' ruled that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional; angry Republicans said this decision threatened to make slavery a national institution.\n\n=== Lincoln and secession ===\nAfter [[Abraham Lincoln]] won the [[1860 presidential election|1860 election]], seven Southern states [[Secession|seceded]] from the union and set up a new nation, the [[Confederate States of America]] (Confederacy), on February 8, 1861. It attacked [[Fort Sumter]], a U.S. Army fort in South Carolina, thus igniting the war. When Lincoln called for troops to suppress the Confederacy in April 1861, four more states seceded and joined the Confederacy. A few of the (northernmost) \"[[slave and free states|slave states]]\" did not secede and became known as the [[Border states (American Civil War)|border states]]; these were Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri.\n\nDuring the war, the northwestern portion of Virginia seceded from the Confederacy. and became the new Union state of [[West Virginia]].<ref>Kenneth Stampp, ''The Causes of the Civil War'' (2008)</ref> West Virginia is usually associated with the [[Border states (American Civil War)|border states]].\n\n===Civil War===\n{{Main|American Civil War}}\nThe Civil War began on April 12, 1861, when elements of 100,000 [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Confederate forces attacked a U.S. military installation]] at [[Fort Sumter]] in [[South Carolina]]. In response to the attack, on April 15, Lincoln called on the states to send detachments totaling 75,000 troops to recapture forts, protect the capital, and \"preserve the Union\", which in his view still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states. The two armies had their first major clash at the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] (Battle of Manassas), ending in a Union defeat, but, more importantly, proved to both the Union and Confederacy that the war would be much longer and bloodier than originally anticipated.<ref>Allen C. Guelzo, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=313dh9YAiE4C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false Fateful Lightning: A New History of the Civil War and Reconstruction]'' (2012) ch 3\u20134</ref>\n\n[[File:PinkertonLincolnMcClernand.jpg|thumb|upright|250px|Lincoln with [[Allan Pinkerton]] and Major General [[John Alexander McClernand]] at the [[Battle of Antietam]].]]\nThe war soon divided into two theaters: [[Eastern Theater of the American Civil War|Eastern]] and [[Western Theater of the American Civil War|Western]]. In the western theater, the Union was relatively successful, with major battles, such as [[Battle of Perryville|Perryville]] and [[Battle of Shiloh|Shiloh]] along with Union gunboat dominance of navigable rivers producing strategic Union victories and destroying major Confederate operations.<ref>Stephen E. Woodworth, ''Decision in the Heartland: The Civil War in the West'' (2011)</ref>\n\nWarfare in the Eastern theater began poorly for the Union as the Confederates won at Manassas Junction (Bull Run), just outside Washington. Major General [[George B. McClellan]] was put in charge of the Union armies. After reorganizing the new [[Army of the Potomac]], McClellan failed to capture the Confederate capital of [[Richmond, Virginia]] in his [[Peninsula Campaign]] and [[Seven Days Battle|retreated after attacks]] from newly appointed Confederate General [[Robert E. Lee]].<ref>Bruce Catton, ''The Army of the Potomac: Mr. Lincoln's Army'' (1962)</ref> Meanwhile, both sides concentrated in 1861\u201362 on raising and training new armies.  The main action was Union success in controlling the border states, with Confederates largely driven out of Maryland, West Virginia (a new state), Kentucky and Missouri. The autumn 1862 Confederate campaign into Maryland was designed to hurt Union morale and win European support. It ended with Confederate retreat at the [[Battle of Antietam]], and Lincoln's warning he would issue an Emancipation Proclamation in January 1863 if the states did not return. Making slavery a central war goal Energized Republicans in the North, as well as their enemies, the anti-war Copperhead Democrats. It ended the risk of British and French intervention.\n\nLee's smaller army won at the [[Battle of Fredericksburg]] late in 1862, causing yet another change in commanders. Lee won again at the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]] in May 1863, while losing his top aide, [[Stonewall Jackson]]. But Lee pushed too hard and ignored the Union threat in the west. Lee invaded Pennsylvania in search of supplies and to cause [[war-weariness]] in the North. In perhaps the [[turning point of the American Civil War|turning point of the war]], Lee's army was badly beaten at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]], July 1\u20133, 1863, and barely made it back to Virginia.<ref>On Lee's strategy in 1863 see James M. McPherson, \"To Conquer a Peace?\" ''Civil War Times'' (March/April 2007) 46#2 pp 26\u201333, online at EBSCO\n</ref>  On the homefront,  industrial expansion in the North expanded dramatically, using its extensive railroad service, and moving industrial workers into munitions factories.  Foreign trade increased, with the United States providing both food and cotton to Britain, And Britain sending in manufactured products and thousands of volunteers for the Union Army (plus a few to the Confederates).  The British operated blockade runners bringing in food, luxury items and munitions to the Confederacy, bringing out tobacco and cotton.  The Union blockade increasingly shut down Confederate ports, and by late 1864 the blockade runners were usually captured before they could make more than a handful of runs.\n\n[[File:Gettysburg by Britton.ogg|left|thumb|Modern recording of [[Gettysburg Address]] originally spoken by [[President of the United States|U.S President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]]]]\n[[File:Kurz and Allison - Battle of Franklin, November 30, 1864.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The [[Battle of Franklin]], November 30, 1864.]]\nIn the West, on July 4, 1863, Union forces under the command of General [[Ulysses S. Grant]] gained control of the Mississippi River at the [[Battle of Vicksburg]], thereby splitting the Confederacy. Lincoln made General Grant commander of all Union armies. Grant put General William Tecumseh Sherman in charge of the Western armies.  In 1864, Sherman marched south from Chattanooga to capture Atlanta, a decisive victory that ended war jitters among Republicans in the North who feared they might fail to reelect Lincoln in 1864.  Lincoln won a landslide. The last two years of the war were bloody for both sides, With Sherman marching almost unopposed through central and eastern Georgia, then moving up through South Carolina and North Carolina, burning cities, destroying plantations, ruining railroads and bridges, but avoiding civilian casualties.  Sherman demonstrated that the South lacked the long-term ability to resist a northern invasion.  Much of the heartland of the Confederacy was physically destroyed, and could no longer provide desperately needed food, horses, mules, wagons, boots or munitions to its combat armies.  In spring 1864 Grant, realizing that Lee was unable to replenish casualties, while Lincoln would provide replacements for Union losses,  launched a [[attrition warfare|war of attrition]] against Lee's [[Army of Northern Virginia]]. This war of attrition was divided into three main campaigns. The first of these, the [[Overland Campaign]] forced Lee to retreat into the city of Petersburg where Grant launched his second major offensive, the [[Richmond-Petersburg Campaign]] in which he [[Siege of Petersburg|besieged Petersburg]]. After a near ten-month siege, Petersburg surrendered. However, the [[Third Battle of Petersburg|defense of Fort Gregg]] allowed Lee to move his army out of Petersburg. Grant pursued and launched the final, [[Appomattox Campaign]] which resulted in Lee surrendering his Army of Northern Virginia numbering 28,000 on April 9, 1865, at [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox Court House]]. Other Confederate armies followed suit and the war ended with no postwar insurgency.\n\nThe American Civil War was the world's earliest [[industrial warfare|industrial war]]. Railroads, the telegraph, steamships, and mass-produced weapons were employed extensively. The mobilization of civilian factories, mines, shipyards, banks, transportation and food supplies all foreshadowed the impact of industrialization in [[World War I]]. It remains the deadliest war in American history, resulting in the deaths of about 750,000 soldiers and an undetermined number of [[civilian casualties]].<ref>A new way of calculating casualties by looking at the deviation of the death rate of men of fighting age from the norm through analysis of census data found that at least 627,000 and at most 888,000 people, but most likely 761,000 people, died through the war.

It broke down barriers of parochialism; it ended distrust of large-scale effort; it hardened and matured the whole people emotionally.  The adolescent land of the 1850s\u2026rose under the blows of battle to adult estate.  The nation of the post-Appomattox generation, though sadly hurt (especially in the South) by war losses, and deeply scarred psychologically (especially in the North) by war hatreds and greeds, had at last the power, resolution, and self-trust of manhood.<ref>Allan Nevins, \"Introduction\" in Paul Gates, ''Agriculture and the Civil War'' (1965) p. v.</ref>\n\n===Emancipation===\n{{See also|Military history of African Americans in the American Civil War|Emancipation Proclamation}}\n{{Emancipation Proclamation draft}}\n[[File:The Emancipation Proclamation - read by Winston Tharp for LibriVox's Short Nonfiction Collection Vol. 028 (2013).ogg|alt=Emancipation Proclamation |left|thumb|Modern reading of President [[Abraham Lincoln|Abraham Lincoln's]] [[Emancipation Proclamation]] of 1863 giving freedom to all [[African Americans]] who resided within the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] but not those within the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]].]]\nThe [[Emancipation Proclamation]] was an executive order issued by President [[Abraham Lincoln]] on January 1, 1863. In a single stroke it changed the legal status, as recognized by the U.S. government, of 3 million slaves in designated areas of the Confederacy from \"slave\" to \"free\". It had the practical effect that as soon as a slave escaped the control of the Confederate government, by running away or through advances of federal troops, the slave became legally and actually free. The owners were never compensated. Plantation owners, realizing that emancipation would destroy their economic system, sometimes moved their slaves as far as possible out of reach of the Union army. By June 1865, the Union Army controlled all of the Confederacy and liberated all of the designated slaves.<ref>Allen C.

President [[Andrew Johnson]], who sought easy terms for reunions with ex-rebels, was virtually powerless in the face of the Radical Republican Congress; he was impeached, but the Senate's attempt to remove him from office failed by one vote. Congress enfranchised black men and temporarily stripped many ex-Confederate leaders of the right to hold office. New Republican governments came to power based on a coalition of Freedmen made up of [[Carpetbaggers]] (new arrivals from the North), and [[Scalawags]] (native white Southerners). They were backed by the U.S. Army. Opponents said they were corrupt and violated the rights of whites.<ref name=\"George C. Rable 2007\">George C.

In response to Radical Reconstruction, the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK) emerged in 1867 as a white-supremacist organization opposed to black civil rights and Republican rule. President Ulysses Grant's vigorous enforcement of the [[Ku Klux Klan Act]] of 1870 shut down the Klan, and it disbanded. [[Paramilitary]]  groups, such as the [[White League]] and [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]] emerged about 1874 that worked openly to use intimidation and violence to suppress black voting to regain white political power in states across the South during the 1870s.

In every major city and state, and at the national level as well, and in education, medicine, and industry, the progressives called for the modernization and reform of decrepit institutions, the elimination of corruption in politics, and the introduction of efficiency as a criterion for change. Leading politicians from both parties, most notably [[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[Charles Evans Hughes]], and [[Robert M.

The movement reorganized after the Civil War, gaining experienced campaigners, many of whom had worked for prohibition in the [[Women's Christian Temperance Union]]. By the end of the 19th century a few western states had granted women full voting rights,<ref>Rebecca J.

Across the world, grateful nations gave women the right to vote. Furthermore, most of the Western states had already given the women the right to vote in state and national elections, and the representatives from those states, including the first woman [[Jeannette Rankin]] of Montana, demonstrated that woman suffrage was a success. The main resistance came from the south, where white leaders were worried about the threat of black women voting.

Roosevelt]] promised \"a [[New Deal]] for the American people\", coining the enduring label for his domestic policies. The result was a series of permanent reform programs including Relief for the unemployed, assistance for the elderly, jobs for young men, social security, unemployment insurance, public housing, bankruptcy insurance, farm subsidies, and regulation of financial securities. State governments added new programs as well, and introduced the sales tax to pay for them. Ideologically the revolution established [[modern liberalism in the United States]] and kept the Democrats in power in Washington almost continuously for Three decades thanks to the [[New Deal Coalition]] of ethnic Whites, Blacks, blue-collar workers, labor unions, and white Southerners.  It provided relief to the long-term unemployed through numerous programs, such as the [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA) and for young men, the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]]. Large scale spending projects designed to provide private sector construction jobs and rebuild the infrastructure were under the purview of the [[Public Works Administration]]. The Second New Deal was a turn to the left in 1935\u201336, building up labor unions through the [[Wagner Act]]. Unions became a powerful element of the merging [[New Deal Coalition]], which won reelection for Roosevelt in 1936, 1940, and 1944 by mobilizing union members, blue collar workers, relief recipients, big city machines, ethnic, and religious groups (especially Catholics and Jews) and the white South, along with blacks in the North (where they could vote). Roosevelt seriously weakened his second term by a failed effort to pack the Supreme Court, which had been a center of conservative resistance to his programs. Most of the relief programs were dropped after 1938 in the 1940s when the conservatives regained power in Congress through the [[Conservative Coalition]]. Of special importance is the [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security program]], begun in 1935. The economy basically recovered by 1936, but had a sharp, short recession in 1937\u201338; long-term unemployment, however, remained a problem until it was solved by wartime spending.<ref>David M.

[[Nazi Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]] militarized and threatened conquests, while Britain and France attempted [[appeasement]] to avert another war in Europe. U.S. legislation in the [[Neutrality Acts of 1930s|Neutrality Acts]] sought to avoid foreign conflicts; however, policy clashed with increasing anti-Nazi feelings following the German [[invasion of Poland]] in September 1939 that started World War II. Roosevelt positioned the U.S. as the \"[[Arsenal of Democracy]]\", pledging full-scale financial and munitions support for the Allies&nbsp;\u2013 but no military personnel.<ref>Conrad Black, ''Roosevelt: Champion of Freedom'' (2003) pp 648\u201382</ref> This was carried out through the [[Lend-Lease]] agreements.

Much of the focus in Washington was maximizing the economic output of the nation. The overall result was a dramatic increase in GDP, the export of vast quantities of supplies to the Allies and to American forces overseas, the end of unemployment, and a rise in civilian consumption even as 40% of the GDP went to the war effort. This was achieved by tens of millions of workers moving from low-productivity occupations to high-efficiency jobs, improvements in productivity through better technology and management, and the move into the active labor force of students, retired people, housewives, and the unemployed, and an increase in hours worked.\n\n[[File:Roosevelt Pearl Harbor.ogg|thumb|left|alt=Infamy speech|President Roosevelt's [[Infamy Speech]] in aftermath of [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor Attack]].

[[Native American cultures in the United States|Numerous indigenous cultures]] formed, and many disappeared before 1500. The arrival of [[Christopher Columbus]] in the year 1492 started the [[European colonization of the Americas]]. Most colonies were formed after 1600, and the early records and writings of [[John Winthrop]] make the [[United States]] the first nation whose most distant origins are fully recorded.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A history of the American people|last=Johnson, Paul, 1928\u2013|date=1999|publisher=HarperPerennial|isbn=0060930349|edition= 1st HarperPerennial |location=New York, NY|pages=32|oclc=40984521|quote=These early diaries and letters, which are plentiful, and the fact that most important documents about the early American colonies have been preserved, mean that the United States is the first nation in human history whose most distant origins are fully recorded.}}</ref> By the 1760s, the [[Thirteen Colonies|thirteen British colonies]] contained 2.5 million people along the [[East Coast of the United States|Atlantic Coast]] east of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. After [[French and Indian Wars|defeating France]], the British government imposed a series of taxes, including the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act of 1765]], rejecting the colonists' constitutional argument that new taxes needed their approval. Resistance to these taxes, especially the [[Boston Tea Party]] in 1773, led to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] issuing [[Intolerable Acts|punitive laws]] designed to end self-government in Massachusetts.\n\nArmed conflict began in 1775. In 1776, in Philadelphia, the [[Second Continental Congress]] [[United States Declaration of Independence|declared the independence]] of the colonies as the United States. Led by General [[George Washington]], it won the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] with large support from France. The [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|peace treaty of 1783]] gave the land east of the Mississippi River (except Canada and Florida) to the new nation. The [[Articles of Confederation]] established a central government, but it was ineffectual at providing stability as it could not collect taxes and had no executive officer. A [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|convention]] in 1787 wrote [[Constitution of the United States|a new Constitution]] that was adopted in 1789. In 1791, a [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] was added to guarantee [[Natural rights and legal rights|inalienable rights]]. With Washington as the first president and [[Alexander Hamilton]] his chief adviser, a strong central government was created. [[Louisiana Purchase|Purchase]] of the [[Louisiana Territory]] from France in 1803 doubled the size of the United States. A second and final war with Britain was [[War of 1812|fought in 1812]], which solidified national pride.\n\nEncouraged by the notion of [[manifest destiny]], U.S. territory expanded [[American frontier|all the way]] to the [[West Coast of the United States|Pacific Coast]]. While the United States was large in terms of area, by 1790 [[Demography of the United States|its population]] was only 4 million. It grew rapidly, however, reaching 7.2 million in 1810, 32 million in 1860, 76 million in 1900, 132 million in 1940, and 321 million in 2015. Economic growth in terms of overall [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] was even greater. Compared to European powers, though, the nation's military strength was relatively limited in peacetime before 1940. [[American frontier|Westward expansion]] was driven by a quest for inexpensive land for [[yeoman]] farmers and slave owners. The expansion of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] was increasingly controversial and fueled political and constitutional battles, which were resolved by compromises. Slavery was abolished in all states [[Northern United States|north]] of the [[Mason\u2013Dixon line]] by 1804, but the [[Southern United States|South]] continued to profit from the institution, mostly from the [[Cotton production in the United States|production of cotton]]. [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] was [[1860 United States presidential election|elected president in 1860]] on a platform of halting the expansion of slavery.\n\nSeven Southern slave states rebelled and created the foundation of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. Its [[Battle of Fort Sumter|attack of Fort Sumter]] against the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union forces]] there in 1861 started the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Defeat of the Confederates in 1865 led to the impoverishment of the South and the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|abolition of slavery]]. In the [[Reconstruction era]] following the war, [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|legal and voting rights were extended]] to [[Freedman|freed slaves]]. The national government emerged much stronger, and because of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] in 1868, it gained explicit duty to protect individual rights. However, when white [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] regained their power in the South in 1877, often by [[paramilitary]] [[Voter suppression in the United States|suppression of voting]], they passed [[Jim Crow laws]] to maintain [[white supremacy]], as well as new [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchising]] [[State constitution (United States)|state constitutions]] that prevented most [[African Americans]] and many [[Poor White|poor whites]] from voting. This continued until the gains of the [[civil rights movement]] in the 1960s and the passage of federal legislation to enforce constitutional rights.\n\nThe United States became the world's leading industrial power at the turn of the 20th century, due to an outburst of entrepreneurship and industrialization in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] and [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] and the arrival of [[European emigration|millions of immigrant workers and farmers from Europe]]. The national railroad network was completed and large-scale mines and factories were established. Mass dissatisfaction with corruption, inefficiency, and traditional politics stimulated the [[Progressive Era|Progressive movement]], from the 1890s to 1920s. This era led to many reforms, including the Sixteenth to Nineteenth constitutional amendments, which brought the federal income tax, direct election of Senators, [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]], and [[Women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage]]. Initially neutral during [[World War I]], the United States [[American entry into World War I|declared war on Germany]] in 1917 and funded the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] victory the following year. Women obtained the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|right to vote]] in 1920, with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] obtaining citizenship and the right to vote in 1924.\n\nAfter [[Roaring Twenties|a prosperous decade]] in the 1920s, the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] marked the onset of the decade-long worldwide [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]]. Democratic President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] ended the Republican dominance of the [[White House]] and implemented his [[New Deal]] programs, which included relief for the unemployed, support for farmers, [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and a [[Minimum wage in the United States|minimum wage]]. The New Deal defined [[Modern liberalism in the United States|modern American liberalism]]. After the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]] in 1941, the United States entered [[World War II]] and financed the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] war effort and helped defeat [[Nazi Germany]] in the [[European theatre of World War II|European theater]]. Its involvement culminated in using newly-invented [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|nuclear weapons on two Japanese cities]] to defeat [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan]] in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theater]].\n\nThe United States and the [[Soviet Union]] emerged as rival superpowers in the [[aftermath of World War II]]. During the [[Cold War]], the two countries confronted each other indirectly in the [[arms race]], the [[Space Race]], [[proxy war]]s, and propaganda campaigns. The goal of the United States in this was to stop the spread of [[communism]]. In the 1960s, in large part due to the strength of the [[civil rights movement]], another wave of social reforms was enacted which enforced the constitutional rights of voting and freedom of movement to African Americans and other racial minorities. The Cold War ended when the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union was officially dissolved]] in 1991, leaving the United States as the world's only superpower.\n\nAfter the Cold War, the United States has been focusing on [[List of modern conflicts in the Middle East|modern conflicts in the Middle East]]. The beginning of the 21st century saw the [[September 11 attacks]] carried out by [[Al-Qaeda]] in 2001, which was later followed by wars in [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq War|Iraq]]. In 2007, the United States entered its [[Great Recession in the United States|worst economic crisis since the Great Depression]], which was followed by slower-than-usual rates of economic growth during the early 2010s. However, in the late 2010s and early 2020s, economic growth increased significantly.\n\n==Early America==\n{{Main|Prehistory of the United States|History of Native Americans in the United States|Pre-Columbian era}}\n{{See also|Native Americans in the United States}}\n[[File:Peopling of America through Beringia.png|thumb|200px|This map shows the approximate location of the ice-free corridor and specific Paleoindian sites ([[Clovis theory]]).]]\nIt is not definitively known how or when Native Americans first [[Settlement of the Americas|settled the Americas]] and the present-day United States. The prevailing theory proposes that people from [[Eurasia]] followed [[Game (hunting)|game]] across [[Beringia]], a [[land bridge]] that connected [[Siberia]] to present-day [[Alaska]] during the [[Last Glacial Period|Ice Age]], and then spread southward throughout the Americas. This migration may have begun as early as 30,000 years ago<ref>{{cite news |title=New Ideas About Human Migration From Asia To Americas |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/10/071025160653.htm |work=ScienceDaily |date=October 29, 2007 |accessdate=March 12, 2011}}</ref> and continued through to about 10,000 years ago, when the land bridge became submerged by the rising sea level caused by the melting glaciers.<ref>{{harvnb|Kennedy|Cohen|Bailey|2006|p=6}}</ref> These early inhabitants, called [[Paleo-Indians]], soon diversified into hundreds of culturally distinct nations and tribes.\n\nThis [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] era incorporates all [[archaeology of the Americas|periods]] in the [[history of the Americas]] before the appearance of European influences on the American continents, spanning from the [[Settlement of the Americas|original settlement]] in the [[Upper Paleolithic]] period to [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonization]] during the [[early modern period]]. While the term technically refers to the era before [[Christopher Columbus]]' voyage in 1492, in practice the term usually includes the history of [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|American indigenous cultures]] until they were conquered or significantly influenced by Europeans, even if this happened decades or centuries after Columbus's initial landing.\n\n===Paleo-Indians===\n[[File:North American cultural areas.png|thumb|200px|left|The [[Cultural area]]s of [[pre-Columbian North America]], according to [[Alfred Kroeber]].]]\nBy 10,000 BCE, humans were relatively well-established throughout [[North America]]. Originally, Paleo-Indian hunted Ice Age [[megafauna]] like [[mammoth]]s, but as they began to go extinct, people turned instead to [[bison]] as a food source. As time went on, foraging for berries and seeds became an important alternative to hunting. Paleo-Indians in central Mexico were the first in the Americas to farm, starting to plant corn, beans, and squash around 8,000 BCE. Eventually, the knowledge began to spread northward. By 3,000 BCE, corn was being grown in the valleys of [[Arizona]] and [[New Mexico]], followed by primitive [[irrigation]] systems and early villages of the [[Hohokam]].<ref name=\":6\"/><ref name=\"mark\">Chenault, Mark, Rick Ahlstrom, and Tom Motsinger, (1993) ''In the Shadow of South Mountain: The Pre-Classic Hohokam of 'La Ciudad de los Hornos{{'}}'', Part I and II.</ref>\n\nOne of the earliest cultures in the present-day United States was the [[Clovis culture]], who are primarily identified by the use of fluted [[spear]] points called the [[Clovis point]]. From 9,100 to 8,850 BCE, the culture ranged over much of North America and also appeared in South America. Artifacts from this culture were first excavated in 1932 near [[Clovis, New Mexico]]. The [[Folsom tradition|Folsom culture]] was similar, but is marked by the use of the [[Folsom point]].\n\nA later migration identified by linguists, anthropologists, and archeologists occurred around 8,000 BCE. This included [[Na-Dene languages|Na-Dene]]-speaking peoples, who reached the [[Pacific Northwest]] by 5,000 BCE.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 670070|title = Toward a Prehistory of the Na-Dene, with a General Comment on Population Movements among Nomadic Hunters|journal = American Anthropologist|volume = 71|issue = 5|pages = 857\u2013863|last1 = Dumond|first1 = D.

They are the earliest known people to have been [[Mound Builders|mound builders]], however, there are mounds in the United States that predate this culture. [[Watson Brake]] is an 11-mound complex in [[Louisiana]] that dates to 3,500 BCE, and nearby [[Poverty Point]], built by the [[Poverty Point culture]], is an earthwork complex that dates to 1,700 BCE. These mounds likely served a religious purpose.\n\nThe Adenans were absorbed into the [[Hopewell tradition]], a powerful people who traded tools and goods across a wide territory. They continued the Adena tradition of mound-building, with remnants of several thousand still in existence across the core of their former territory in southern [[Ohio]]. The Hopewell pioneered a trading system called the Hopewell Exchange System, which at its greatest extent ran from the present-day Southeast up to the Canadian side of [[Lake Ontario]].<ref name=\":8\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=1283|title=Hopewell|publisher=Ohio History Central}}</ref> By 500 CE, the Hopewellians had too disappeared, absorbed into the larger [[Mississippian culture]].\n\nThe Mississippians were a broad group of tribes. Their most important city was [[Cahokia]], near modern-day [[St. Louis|St. Louis, Missouri]]. At its peak in the 12th century, the city had an estimated population of 20,000, larger than the population of London at the time. The entire city was centered around a [[Monks Mound|mound]] that stood {{Convert|100|ft|m|abbr=}} tall. Cahokia, like many other cities and villages of the time, depended on hunting, foraging, trading, and agriculture, and developed a class system with slaves and human sacrifice that was influenced by societies to the south, like the [[Maya peoples|Mayans]].<ref name=\":6\"/>\n\nIn the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]], the [[Ancestral Puebloans|Anasazi]] began constructing stone and adobe pueblos around 900 BCE.<ref name=\"eb\">[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/22804/Ancestral-Pueblo-culture \"Ancestral Pueblo culture.\"] ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica.''

Many distinct cultural and political nations developed there, but they all shared certain beliefs traditions, and practices, such as the centrality of [[salmon]] as a resource and spiritual symbol. Permanent villages began to develop in this region as early as 1,000 BCE, and these communities celebrated by the gift-giving feast of the [[potlatch]].

After the collapse of the first [[Charlesbourg-Royal|Quebec]] colony in the 1540s, French [[Huguenots]] settled at [[Fort Caroline]] near present-day [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]] in Florida. In 1565, Spanish forces led by [[Pedro Men\u00e9ndez de Avil\u00e9s|Pedro Men\u00e9ndez]] destroyed the settlement and established the first European settlement in what would become the United States \u2014 [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]].\n\nAfter this, the French mostly remained in [[Quebec]] and [[Acadia]], but far-reaching trade relationships with Native Americans throughout the Great Lakes and Midwest spread their influence. French colonists in small villages along the Mississippi and [[Illinois River|Illinois]] rivers lived in farming communities that served as a grain source for Gulf Coast settlements. The French established plantations in Louisiana along with settling [[New Orleans]], [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] and [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]].\n\n=== British colonies ===\n{{Further|British colonization of the Americas}}\n[[File:Descriptionofnewengland 2 smith 64kb.ogg|thumb|Excerpt of a ''Description of New England'' by English explorer [[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith]], published in 1616.]]\n\n[[File:MayflowerHarbor.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The ''[[Mayflower]]'', which transported [[Pilgrim (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]] to the New World.

The first British colony in North America was established at [[Roanoke Colony|Roanoke]] by [[Walter Raleigh]] in 1585, but failed. It would be twenty years before another attempt.<ref name=\":6\"/>\n\nThe early British colonies were established by private groups seeking profit, and were marked by starvation, disease, and Native American attacks. Many immigrants were people seeking religious freedom or escaping political oppression, peasants displaced by the Industrial Revolution, or those simply seeking adventure and opportunity.\n\nIn some areas, Native Americans taught colonists how to plant and harvest the native crops. In others, they attacked the settlers. Virgin forests provided an ample supply of building material and firewood. Natural inlets and harbors lined the coast, providing easy ports for essential trade with Europe. Settlements remained close to the coast due to this as well as Native American resistance and the Appalachian Mountains that were found in the interior.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n==== The first settlement: Jamestown ====\n[[Image:Squantoteaching.png|thumb|200px|[[Squanto]] known for having been an early liaison between the native populations in Southern New England and the ''Mayflower'' settlers, who made their settlement at the site of Squanto's former summer village.]]\n\nThe first successful English colony, [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], was established by the [[London Company|Virginia Company]] in 1607 on the [[James River]] in [[Virginia]]. The colonists were preoccupied with the search for gold and were ill-equipped for life in the New World. Captain [[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith]] held the fledgling Jamestown together in the first year, and the colony descended into anarchy and nearly failed when he returned to England two years later. [[John Rolfe]] began experimenting with tobacco from the West Indies in 1612, and by 1614 the first shipment arrived in London. It became Virginia's chief source of revenue within a decade.\n\nIn 1624, after years of disease and Indian attacks, including the [[Powhatan attack of 1622]], [[James VI and I|King James I]] revoked the Virginia Company's charter and made Virginia a royal colony.\n\n==== New England ====\n[[File:Thanksgiving-Brownscombe.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Jennie Augusta Brownscombe]], ''The First Thanksgiving at Plymouth'', 1914, Pilgrim Hall Museum, Plymouth, Massachusetts]]\n\n[[New England]] was initially settled primarily by [[Puritans]] fleeing religious persecution. The [[Pilgrims (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]] sailed for Virginia on the Mayflower in 1620, but were knocked off course by a storm and landed at [[Plymouth Colony|Plymouth]], where they agreed to a social contract of rules in the [[Mayflower Compact]]. Like Jamestown, Plymouth suffered from disease and starvation, but local [[Wampanoag]] Indians taught the colonists how to farm maize.\n\nPlymouth was followed by the [[Puritans]] and [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] in 1630. They maintained a charter for self-government separate from England, and elected founder [[John Winthrop]] as the governor for most of its early years. [[Roger Williams]] opposed Winthrop's treatment of Native Americans and religious intolerance, and established the colony of [[Providence Plantations]], later [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]], on the basis of freedom of religion. Other colonists established settlements in the [[Connecticut River]] Valley, and on the coasts of present-day [[New Hampshire]] and [[Maine]]. Native American attacks continued, with the most significant occurring in the 1637 [[Pequot War]] and the 1675 [[King Philip's War]].\n\nNew England became a center of commerce and industry due to the poor, mountainous soil making agriculture difficult. Rivers were harnessed to power grain mills and sawmills, and the numerous harbors facilitated trade. Tight-knit villages developed around these industrial centers, and [[Boston]] became one of America's most important ports.\n\n==== Middle Colonies ====\n[[File:Indians_at_a_Hudson_Bay_Company_trading_post.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Indians trade 90-lb packs of furs at a Hudson's Bay Company trading post in the 19th century.]]\n\nIn the 1660s, the [[Middle Colonies]] of [[Province of New York|New York]], [[Province of New Jersey|New Jersey]], and [[History of Delaware|Delaware]] were established in the former Dutch New Netherland, and were characterized by a large degree of ethnic and religious diversity. At the same time, the [[Iroquois]] of New York, strengthened by years of fur trading with Europeans, formed the powerful Iroquois Confederacy.\n\nThe last colony in this region was [[Province of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]], established in 1681 by [[William Penn]] as a home for religious dissenters, including [[Quakers]], [[Methodism|Methodists]], and the [[Amish]].<ref name=\":9\" /> The capital of colony, [[Philadelphia]], became a dominant commercial center in a few short years, with busy docks and brick houses. While Quakers populated the city, [[German Americans|German]] immigrants began to flood into the Pennsylvanian hills and forests, while the [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scots-Irish]] pushed into the far western frontier.\n\n==== Southern Colonies ====\nThe extremely rural [[Southern Colonies]] contrasted greatly with the north. Outside of Virginia, the first British colony south of New England was [[Province of Maryland|Maryland]], established as a Catholic haven in 1632. The economy of these two colonies was built entirely on [[yeoman]] farmers and planters. The planters established themselves in the [[Tidewater (region)|Tidewater]] region of Virginia, establishing massive [[Plantations in the American South|plantations]] with slave labor, while the small-scale farmers made their way into political office.\n\nIn 1670, the [[Province of Carolina]] was established, and [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] became the region's great trading port. While Virginia's economy was based on tobacco, Carolina was much more diversified, exporting rice, indigo, and lumber as well. In 1712 the colony was split in half, creating [[Province of North Carolina|North]] and [[Province of South Carolina|South Carolina]]. The [[Province of Georgia|Georgia Colony]]&nbsp;\u2013 the last of the Thirteen Colonies&nbsp;\u2013 was established by [[James Oglethorpe]] in 1732 as a border to Spanish Florida and a reform colony for former prisoners and the poor.<ref name=\":9\">Richard Middleton and Anne Lombard ''Colonial America: A History to 1763'' (4th ed. 2011)</ref>\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\u201d>\n1622 massacre jamestown de Bry.jpg|The [[Indian massacre of 1622|Indian massacre of Jamestown settlers]] in 1622.

American [[Evangelicalism|Evangelicals]] affected by the Awakening added a new emphasis on divine outpourings of the Holy Spirit and conversions that implanted new believers with an intense love for God. Revivals encapsulated those hallmarks and carried the newly created evangelicalism into the early republic, setting the stage for the [[Second Great Awakening]] in the late 1790s.<ref>Thomas S. Kidd, ''The Great Awakening: The Roots of Evangelical Christianity in Colonial America'' (2009)</ref> In the early stages, evangelicals in the South, such as [[Methodism|Methodists]] and [[Baptists in the United States|Baptists]], preached for religious freedom and abolition of slavery; they converted many slaves and recognized some as preachers.\n\n==== Government ====\nEach of the 13 American colonies had a slightly different governmental structure. Typically, a colony was ruled by a governor appointed from London who controlled the executive administration and relied upon a locally elected legislature to vote on taxes and make laws. By the 18th century, the American colonies were growing very rapidly as a result of low death rates along with ample supplies of land and food. The colonies were richer than most parts of Britain, and attracted a steady flow of immigrants, especially teenagers who arrived as indentured servants.<ref name=\"Max Savelle 2005 185\u201390\">{{cite book |author=Max Savelle|title=Seeds of Liberty: The Genesis of the American Mind|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hIgl_HNozQsC&pg=PA185|origyear=1948|year=2005|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|pages=185\u201390|isbn=9781419107078}}</ref>\n\n==== Servitude and slavery ====\nOver half of all European immigrants to Colonial America arrived as [[Indentured servitude|indentured servants]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/nai_cilh/servitude.html|title=Indentured Servitude in Colonial America|last=Barker|first=Deanna|publisher=National Association for Interpretation, Cultural Interpretation and Living History Section|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091022161033/http://geocities.com/nai_cilh/servitude.html|archivedate=October 22, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Few could afford the cost of the journey to America, and so this form of unfree labor provided a means to immigrate. Typically, people would sign a contract agreeing to a set term of labor, usually four to seven years, and in return would receive transport to America and a piece of land at the end of their servitude. In some cases, ships' captains received rewards for the delivery of poor migrants, and so extravagant promises and kidnapping were common. The Virginia Company and the Massachusetts Bay Company also utilized indentured servant labor.<ref name=\":6\"/>\n\nThe first [[Slavery in the United States|African slaves]] were brought to Virginia from the British West Indies in 1619, just twelve years after the founding of Jamestown. Initially regarded as indentured servants who could buy their freedom, the institution of slavery began to harden and the involuntary servitude became lifelong as the demand for labor on tobacco and rice plantations grew in the 1660s. Slavery became identified with brown skin color, at the time seen as a \"[[black race]]\", and the children of slave women were born slaves (''[[partus sequitur ventrem]]''). By the 1770s African slaves comprised a fifth of the American population.\n\nThe question of independence from Britain did not arise as long as the colonies needed British military support against the French and Spanish powers. Those threats were gone by 1765. London, however, continued to regard the American colonies as existing for the benefit of the mother country in a policy known as [[mercantilism]].<ref name=\"Max Savelle 2005 185\u201390\" />\n\nColonial America was defined by a severe labor shortage that utilized forms of [[Unfree labour|unfree labor]], such as [[Slavery in the colonial United States|slavery]] and [[indentured servitude]].The British colonies were also marked by a policy of avoiding strict enforcement of parliamentary laws, known as [[salutary neglect]]. This permitted the development of an American spirit distinct from that of its European founders.<ref name=\"history of colonial2\">{{cite encyclopedia|last=Henretta|first=James A.|title=History of Colonial America|url=http://encarta.msn.com/text_1741502191___0/History_of_Colonial_America.html|encyclopedia=Encarta Online Encyclopedia|year=2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923141733/http://encarta.msn.com/text_1741502191___0/History_of_Colonial_America.html|archivedate=September 23, 2009|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Road to independence==\n[[File:Nouvelle-France map-en.svg|thumb|Map of the [[British colonization of the Americas|British]] and [[New France|French]] settlements in North America in 1750, before the [[French and Indian War]]]]\nAn upper-class emerged in South Carolina and Virginia, with wealth based on large plantations operated by slave labor. A unique class system operated in [[upstate New York]], where Dutch tenant farmers rented land from very wealthy Dutch proprietors, such as the [[Van Rensselaer (family)|Van Rensselaer family]]. The other colonies were more egalitarian, with Pennsylvania being representative. By the mid-18th century Pennsylvania was basically a middle-class colony with limited respect for its small upper-class. A writer in the ''Pennsylvania Journal'' in 1756 summed it up:\n<blockquote>The People of this Province are generally of the middling Sort, and at present pretty much upon a Level. They are chiefly industrious Farmers, Artificers or Men in Trade; they enjoy in are fond of Freedom, and the ''meanest among them'' thinks he has a right to Civility from the greatest.<ref>Clinton Rossiter, ''Seedtime of the Republic: the origin of the American tradition of political liberty'' (1953) p 106.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n===Political integration and autonomy===\n[[File:Benjamin Franklin - Join or Die.jpg|thumb|''[[Join, or Die]]'': This 1756 political cartoon by [[Benjamin Franklin]] urged the colonies to join together during the French and Indian War.]]\nThe [[French and Indian War]] (1754\u201363), part of the larger [[Seven Years' War]], was a watershed event in the political development of the colonies. The influence of the French and Native Americans, the main rivals of the [[The Crown|British Crown]] in the colonies and Canada, was significantly reduced and the territory of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] expanded into [[New France]], both in Canada and [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]]. The war effort also resulted in greater political integration of the colonies, as reflected in the [[Albany Congress]] and symbolized by [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s call for the colonies to \"[[Join, or Die]]\". Franklin was a man of many inventions&nbsp;\u2013 one of which was the concept of a United States of America, which emerged after 1765 and would be realized a decade later.<ref>{{cite book |author=H.W.

In the following years, strains developed in the relations between the colonists and the Crown. The [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]] passed the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act of 1765]], imposing a tax on the colonies, without going through the colonial legislatures. The issue was drawn: did Parliament have the right to tax Americans who were not represented in it? Crying \"[[No taxation without representation]]\", the colonists refused to pay the taxes as tensions escalated in the late 1760s and early 1770s.<ref>{{cite book |author=Edmund S.

Parliament quickly responded the next year with the [[Intolerable Acts]], stripping Massachusetts of its historic right of self-government and putting it under military rule, which sparked outrage and resistance in all thirteen colonies. [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] leaders from every colony convened the [[First Continental Congress]] to coordinate their resistance to the Intolerable Acts. The Congress called for a [[Continental Association|boycott of British trade]], published a [[Declaration and Resolves of the First Continental Congress|list of rights and grievances]], and [[Petition to the King|petitioned the king]] to rectify those grievances.<ref>{{cite book |author=Robert Allison|title=The Boston Tea Party|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D6x7Cmio5hoC|year=2007|publisher=Applewood Books|pages=47\u201363|isbn=9781933212111}}</ref> This appeal to the Crown had no effect, though, and so the [[Second Continental Congress]] was convened in 1775 to organize the defense of the colonies against the British Army.\n\nCommon people became insurgents against the British even though they were unfamiliar with the ideological rationales being offered. They held very strongly a sense of \"rights\" that they felt the British were deliberately violating&nbsp;\u2013 rights that stressed local autonomy, fair dealing, and government by consent. They were highly sensitive to the issue of tyranny, which they saw manifested by the arrival in Boston of the British Army to punish the Bostonians. This heightened their sense of violated rights, leading to rage and demands for revenge, and they had faith that God was on their side.<ref>Mark Edward Lender, review of ''American Insurgents, American Patriots: The Revolution of the People'' (2010) by T.

His biggest challenge was logistics,  since neither Congress nor the states had the funding to provide adequately for the equipment, munitions, clothing, paychecks, or even the food supply of the soldiers.\n\nAs a battlefield tactician, Washington was often outmaneuvered by his British counterparts. As a strategist, however, he had a better idea of how to win the war than they did. The British sent four invasion armies. Washington's strategy forced the first army out of Boston in 1776, and was responsible for the surrender of the second and third armies at Saratoga (1777) and Yorktown (1781). He limited the British control to New York City and a few places while keeping Patriot control of the great majority of the population.<ref name=\"NEH EDSITEMENT\">Lesson Plan on \"What Made George Washington a Good Military Leader?\" [http://edsitement.neh.gov/curriculum-unit/what-made-george-washington-good-military-leader NEH EDSITEMENT]</ref>\n\n=== Loyalists and Britain ===\n[[File:Declaration of Independence (1819), by John Trumbull.jpg|thumb|[[John Trumbull]]'s ''[[Declaration of Independence (Trumbull)|Declaration of Independence]]'' (1819)]]\nThe Loyalists, whom the British counted upon too heavily, comprised about 20% of the population but never were well organized.

With the migration of settlers to the Northwest, soon they became states.

A compromise gave the South Congressional apportionment out of proportion to its free population by allowing it to include three-fifths of the number of slaves in each state's total population. This provision increased the political power of southern representatives in Congress, especially as slavery was extended into the Deep South through removal of Native Americans and transportation of slaves by an extensive domestic trade.\n\nTo assuage the Anti-Federalists who feared a too-powerful national government, the nation adopted the [[United States Bill of Rights]] in 1791. Comprising the first ten amendments of the Constitution, it guaranteed individual liberties such as freedom of speech and religious practice, jury trials, and stated that citizens and states had reserved rights (which were not specified).<ref>Richard Labunski, ''James Madison and the Struggle for the Bill of Rights'' (2008)</ref>\n\n===President George Washington===\n\n[[File:Stuart-george-washington-constable-1797.jpg|thumb|left|[[George Washington]] legacy remains among the two or three greatest in American history, as Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army, hero of the Revolution, and the first President of the United States.]]\n[[File:Farewelladdresses 01 various 128kb.ogg|thumb|Reading of the [[George Washington's Farewell Address|Farewell address]] of President George Washington, 1796]]\n\n[[George Washington]]&nbsp;\u2013 a renowned hero of the [[American Revolutionary War]], commander-in-chief of the [[Continental Army]], and president of the [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]]&nbsp;\u2013 became the first President of the United States under the new [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] in 1789.

Inspired by revolutionary ideals of the equality of men and influenced by their lesser economic reliance on slavery, northern states abolished slavery.\n\nStates of the [[Upper South]] made [[manumission]] easier, resulting in an increase in the proportion of [[Free negro|free blacks]] in the Upper South (as a percentage of the total non-white population) from less than one percent in 1792 to more than 10 percent by 1810.

The former Jeffersonian (Democratic-Republican) party split into factions. They split over the choice of a successor to President [[James Monroe]], and the party faction that supported many of the old Jeffersonian principles, led by [[Andrew Jackson]] and [[Martin Van Buren]], became the Democratic Party. As Norton explains the transformation in 1828:\n<blockquote>Jacksonians believed the people's will had finally prevailed. Through a lavishly financed coalition of state parties, political leaders, and newspaper editors, a popular movement had elected the president. The Democrats became the nation's first well-organized national party, and tight party organization became the hallmark of nineteenth-century American politics.<ref>Mary Beth Norton et al., ''A People and a Nation, Volume I: to 1877'' (Houghton Mifflin, 2007) p 287</ref></blockquote>\n\nOpposing factions led by [[Henry Clay]] helped form the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]]. The Democratic Party had a small but decisive advantage over the Whigs until the 1850s, when the Whigs fell apart over the issue of slavery.\n\nBehind the platforms issued by state and national parties stood a widely shared political outlook that characterized the Democrats:\n\n[[File:Clay44b.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Horace Greeley]]'s ''New York Tribune''\u2014the leading Whig paper\u2014endorsed Clay for President and Fillmore for Governor, 1844.]]\n<blockquote>The Democrats represented a wide range of views but shared a fundamental commitment to the Jeffersonian concept of an agrarian society. They viewed the central government as the enemy of individual liberty. The 1824 \"corrupt bargain\" had strengthened their suspicion of Washington politics.&nbsp;... Jacksonians feared the concentration of economic and political power. They believed that government intervention in the economy benefited special-interest groups and created corporate monopolies that favored the rich. They sought to restore the independence of the individual (the \"common man,\" i.e. the artisan and the ordinary farmer) by ending federal support of banks and corporations and restricting the use of paper currency, which they distrusted. Their definition of the proper role of government tended to be negative, and Jackson's political power was largely expressed in negative acts. He exercised the veto more than all previous presidents combined. Jackson and his supporters also opposed reform as a movement. Reformers eager to turn their programs into legislation called for a more active government. But Democrats tended to oppose programs like educational reform mid the establishment of a public education system. They believed, for instance, that public schools restricted individual liberty by interfering with parental responsibility and undermined freedom of religion by replacing church schools. Nor did Jackson share reformers' humanitarian concerns. He had no sympathy for American Indians, initiating the removal of the Cherokees along the Trail of Tears.<ref>Mary Beth Norton et al., ''A People and a Nation, Volume I: to 1877'' (2007) pp 287\u201388</ref><ref>Robert Allen Rutland, ''The Democrats: From Jefferson to Clinton'' (U. of Missouri Press, 1995) ch 1\u20134</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe great majority of anti-slavery activists, such as Abraham Lincoln and Mr. Walters, rejected [[William_Lloyd_Garrison|Garrison's]] theology and held that slavery was an unfortunate social evil, not a sin.<ref>{{cite book |author=James Oakes|title=The Radical and the Republican: Frederick Douglass, Abraham Lincoln, and the Triumph of Antislavery Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rK0ThVhgcbAC&pg=PA57|year=2008|publisher=W.

Enormous popular attention in the media focuses on the \"Wild West\" of the second half of the 19th century.

Much larger numbers in the North were against the expansion of slavery, seeking to put it on the path to extinction so that America would be committed to free land (as in low-cost farms owned and cultivated by a family), free labor, and free speech (as opposed to censorship of abolitionist material in the South). Southern whites insisted that slavery was of economic, social, and cultural benefit to all whites (and even to the slaves themselves), and denounced all anti-slavery spokesmen as \"abolitionists\".<ref>Jeff Forret, ''Slavery in the United States'' (Facts on File, 2012)</ref> Justifications of slavery included economics, history, religion, legality, social good, and even humanitarianism, to further their arguments.

The [[Plantations in the American South|plantations]] were highly profitable, due to the heavy European demand for raw cotton. Most of the profits were invested in new lands and in purchasing more slaves (largely drawn from the declining [[tobacco]] regions).\n\n[[File:National-atlas-1970-1860.png|right|thumb|300px|The United States, immediately before the Civil War.

The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 required the states to cooperate with slave owners when attempting to recover escaped slaves, which outraged Northerners. Formerly, an escaped slave that reached a non-slave state was presumed to have attained sanctuary and freedom under the [[Missouri Compromise]]. The Supreme Court's 1857 decision in ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' ruled that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional; angry Republicans said this decision threatened to make slavery a national institution.\n\n=== Lincoln and secession ===\nAfter [[Abraham Lincoln]] won the [[1860 presidential election|1860 election]], seven Southern states [[Secession|seceded]] from the union and set up a new nation, the [[Confederate States of America]] (Confederacy), on February 8, 1861. It attacked [[Fort Sumter]], a U.S. Army fort in South Carolina, thus igniting the war. When Lincoln called for troops to suppress the Confederacy in April 1861, four more states seceded and joined the Confederacy. A few of the (northernmost) \"[[slave and free states|slave states]]\" did not secede and became known as the [[Border states (American Civil War)|border states]]; these were Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri.\n\nDuring the war, the northwestern portion of Virginia seceded from the Confederacy. and became the new Union state of [[West Virginia]].<ref>Kenneth Stampp, ''The Causes of the Civil War'' (2008)</ref> West Virginia is usually associated with the [[Border states (American Civil War)|border states]].\n\n===Civil War===\n{{Main|American Civil War}}\nThe Civil War began on April 12, 1861, when elements of 100,000 [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Confederate forces attacked a U.S. military installation]] at [[Fort Sumter]] in [[South Carolina]]. In response to the attack, on April 15, Lincoln called on the states to send detachments totaling 75,000 troops to recapture forts, protect the capital, and \"preserve the Union\", which in his view still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states. The two armies had their first major clash at the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] (Battle of Manassas), ending in a Union defeat, but, more importantly, proved to both the Union and Confederacy that the war would be much longer and bloodier than originally anticipated.<ref>Allen C. Guelzo, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=313dh9YAiE4C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false Fateful Lightning: A New History of the Civil War and Reconstruction]'' (2012) ch 3\u20134</ref>\n\n[[File:PinkertonLincolnMcClernand.jpg|thumb|upright|250px|Lincoln with [[Allan Pinkerton]] and Major General [[John Alexander McClernand]] at the [[Battle of Antietam]].]]\nThe war soon divided into two theaters: [[Eastern Theater of the American Civil War|Eastern]] and [[Western Theater of the American Civil War|Western]]. In the western theater, the Union was relatively successful, with major battles, such as [[Battle of Perryville|Perryville]] and [[Battle of Shiloh|Shiloh]] along with Union gunboat dominance of navigable rivers producing strategic Union victories and destroying major Confederate operations.<ref>Stephen E. Woodworth, ''Decision in the Heartland: The Civil War in the West'' (2011)</ref>\n\nWarfare in the Eastern theater began poorly for the Union as the Confederates won at Manassas Junction (Bull Run), just outside Washington. Major General [[George B. McClellan]] was put in charge of the Union armies. After reorganizing the new [[Army of the Potomac]], McClellan failed to capture the Confederate capital of [[Richmond, Virginia]] in his [[Peninsula Campaign]] and [[Seven Days Battle|retreated after attacks]] from newly appointed Confederate General [[Robert E. Lee]].<ref>Bruce Catton, ''The Army of the Potomac: Mr. Lincoln's Army'' (1962)</ref> Meanwhile, both sides concentrated in 1861\u201362 on raising and training new armies.  The main action was Union success in controlling the border states, with Confederates largely driven out of Maryland, West Virginia (a new state), Kentucky and Missouri. The autumn 1862 Confederate campaign into Maryland was designed to hurt Union morale and win European support. It ended with Confederate retreat at the [[Battle of Antietam]], and Lincoln's warning he would issue an Emancipation Proclamation in January 1863 if the states did not return. Making slavery a central war goal Energized Republicans in the North, as well as their enemies, the anti-war Copperhead Democrats. It ended the risk of British and French intervention.\n\nLee's smaller army won at the [[Battle of Fredericksburg]] late in 1862, causing yet another change in commanders. Lee won again at the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]] in May 1863, while losing his top aide, [[Stonewall Jackson]]. But Lee pushed too hard and ignored the Union threat in the west. Lee invaded Pennsylvania in search of supplies and to cause [[war-weariness]] in the North. In perhaps the [[turning point of the American Civil War|turning point of the war]], Lee's army was badly beaten at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]], July 1\u20133, 1863, and barely made it back to Virginia.<ref>On Lee's strategy in 1863 see James M. McPherson, \"To Conquer a Peace?\" ''Civil War Times'' (March/April 2007) 46#2 pp 26\u201333, online at EBSCO\n</ref>  On the homefront,  industrial expansion in the North expanded dramatically, using its extensive railroad service, and moving industrial workers into munitions factories.  Foreign trade increased, with the United States providing both food and cotton to Britain, And Britain sending in manufactured products and thousands of volunteers for the Union Army (plus a few to the Confederates).  The British operated blockade runners bringing in food, luxury items and munitions to the Confederacy, bringing out tobacco and cotton.  The Union blockade increasingly shut down Confederate ports, and by late 1864 the blockade runners were usually captured before they could make more than a handful of runs.\n\n[[File:Gettysburg by Britton.ogg|left|thumb|Modern recording of [[Gettysburg Address]] originally spoken by [[President of the United States|U.S President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]]]]\n[[File:Kurz and Allison - Battle of Franklin, November 30, 1864.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The [[Battle of Franklin]], November 30, 1864.]]\nIn the West, on July 4, 1863, Union forces under the command of General [[Ulysses S. Grant]] gained control of the Mississippi River at the [[Battle of Vicksburg]], thereby splitting the Confederacy. Lincoln made General Grant commander of all Union armies. Grant put General William Tecumseh Sherman in charge of the Western armies.  In 1864, Sherman marched south from Chattanooga to capture Atlanta, a decisive victory that ended war jitters among Republicans in the North who feared they might fail to reelect Lincoln in 1864.  Lincoln won a landslide. The last two years of the war were bloody for both sides, With Sherman marching almost unopposed through central and eastern Georgia, then moving up through South Carolina and North Carolina, burning cities, destroying plantations, ruining railroads and bridges, but avoiding civilian casualties.  Sherman demonstrated that the South lacked the long-term ability to resist a northern invasion.  Much of the heartland of the Confederacy was physically destroyed, and could no longer provide desperately needed food, horses, mules, wagons, boots or munitions to its combat armies.  In spring 1864 Grant, realizing that Lee was unable to replenish casualties, while Lincoln would provide replacements for Union losses,  launched a [[attrition warfare|war of attrition]] against Lee's [[Army of Northern Virginia]]. This war of attrition was divided into three main campaigns. The first of these, the [[Overland Campaign]] forced Lee to retreat into the city of Petersburg where Grant launched his second major offensive, the [[Richmond-Petersburg Campaign]] in which he [[Siege of Petersburg|besieged Petersburg]]. After a near ten-month siege, Petersburg surrendered. However, the [[Third Battle of Petersburg|defense of Fort Gregg]] allowed Lee to move his army out of Petersburg. Grant pursued and launched the final, [[Appomattox Campaign]] which resulted in Lee surrendering his Army of Northern Virginia numbering 28,000 on April 9, 1865, at [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox Court House]]. Other Confederate armies followed suit and the war ended with no postwar insurgency.\n\nThe American Civil War was the world's earliest [[industrial warfare|industrial war]]. Railroads, the telegraph, steamships, and mass-produced weapons were employed extensively. The mobilization of civilian factories, mines, shipyards, banks, transportation and food supplies all foreshadowed the impact of industrialization in [[World War I]]. It remains the deadliest war in American history, resulting in the deaths of about 750,000 soldiers and an undetermined number of [[civilian casualties]].<ref>A new way of calculating casualties by looking at the deviation of the death rate of men of fighting age from the norm through analysis of census data found that at least 627,000 and at most 888,000 people, but most likely 761,000 people, died through the war.

It broke down barriers of parochialism; it ended distrust of large-scale effort; it hardened and matured the whole people emotionally.  The adolescent land of the 1850s\u2026rose under the blows of battle to adult estate.  The nation of the post-Appomattox generation, though sadly hurt (especially in the South) by war losses, and deeply scarred psychologically (especially in the North) by war hatreds and greeds, had at last the power, resolution, and self-trust of manhood.<ref>Allan Nevins, \"Introduction\" in Paul Gates, ''Agriculture and the Civil War'' (1965) p. v.</ref>\n\n===Emancipation===\n{{See also|Military history of African Americans in the American Civil War|Emancipation Proclamation}}\n{{Emancipation Proclamation draft}}\n[[File:The Emancipation Proclamation - read by Winston Tharp for LibriVox's Short Nonfiction Collection Vol. 028 (2013).ogg|alt=Emancipation Proclamation |left|thumb|Modern reading of President [[Abraham Lincoln|Abraham Lincoln's]] [[Emancipation Proclamation]] of 1863 giving freedom to all [[African Americans]] who resided within the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] but not those within the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]].]]\nThe [[Emancipation Proclamation]] was an executive order issued by President [[Abraham Lincoln]] on January 1, 1863. In a single stroke it changed the legal status, as recognized by the U.S. government, of 3 million slaves in designated areas of the Confederacy from \"slave\" to \"free\". It had the practical effect that as soon as a slave escaped the control of the Confederate government, by running away or through advances of federal troops, the slave became legally and actually free. The owners were never compensated. Plantation owners, realizing that emancipation would destroy their economic system, sometimes moved their slaves as far as possible out of reach of the Union army. By June 1865, the Union Army controlled all of the Confederacy and liberated all of the designated slaves.<ref>Allen C.

President [[Andrew Johnson]], who sought easy terms for reunions with ex-rebels, was virtually powerless in the face of the Radical Republican Congress; he was impeached, but the Senate's attempt to remove him from office failed by one vote. Congress enfranchised black men and temporarily stripped many ex-Confederate leaders of the right to hold office. New Republican governments came to power based on a coalition of Freedmen made up of [[Carpetbaggers]] (new arrivals from the North), and [[Scalawags]] (native white Southerners). They were backed by the U.S. Army. Opponents said they were corrupt and violated the rights of whites.<ref name=\"George C. Rable 2007\">George C.

In response to Radical Reconstruction, the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK) emerged in 1867 as a white-supremacist organization opposed to black civil rights and Republican rule. President Ulysses Grant's vigorous enforcement of the [[Ku Klux Klan Act]] of 1870 shut down the Klan, and it disbanded. [[Paramilitary]]  groups, such as the [[White League]] and [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]] emerged about 1874 that worked openly to use intimidation and violence to suppress black voting to regain white political power in states across the South during the 1870s.

In every major city and state, and at the national level as well, and in education, medicine, and industry, the progressives called for the modernization and reform of decrepit institutions, the elimination of corruption in politics, and the introduction of efficiency as a criterion for change. Leading politicians from both parties, most notably [[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[Charles Evans Hughes]], and [[Robert M.

The movement reorganized after the Civil War, gaining experienced campaigners, many of whom had worked for prohibition in the [[Women's Christian Temperance Union]]. By the end of the 19th century a few western states had granted women full voting rights,<ref>Rebecca J.

Across the world, grateful nations gave women the right to vote. Furthermore, most of the Western states had already given the women the right to vote in state and national elections, and the representatives from those states, including the first woman [[Jeannette Rankin]] of Montana, demonstrated that woman suffrage was a success. The main resistance came from the south, where white leaders were worried about the threat of black women voting.

Roosevelt]] promised \"a [[New Deal]] for the American people\", coining the enduring label for his domestic policies. The result was a series of permanent reform programs including Relief for the unemployed, assistance for the elderly, jobs for young men, social security, unemployment insurance, public housing, bankruptcy insurance, farm subsidies, and regulation of financial securities. State governments added new programs as well, and introduced the sales tax to pay for them. Ideologically the revolution established [[modern liberalism in the United States]] and kept the Democrats in power in Washington almost continuously for Three decades thanks to the [[New Deal Coalition]] of ethnic Whites, Blacks, blue-collar workers, labor unions, and white Southerners.  It provided relief to the long-term unemployed through numerous programs, such as the [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA) and for young men, the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]]. Large scale spending projects designed to provide private sector construction jobs and rebuild the infrastructure were under the purview of the [[Public Works Administration]]. The Second New Deal was a turn to the left in 1935\u201336, building up labor unions through the [[Wagner Act]]. Unions became a powerful element of the merging [[New Deal Coalition]], which won reelection for Roosevelt in 1936, 1940, and 1944 by mobilizing union members, blue collar workers, relief recipients, big city machines, ethnic, and religious groups (especially Catholics and Jews) and the white South, along with blacks in the North (where they could vote). Roosevelt seriously weakened his second term by a failed effort to pack the Supreme Court, which had been a center of conservative resistance to his programs. Most of the relief programs were dropped after 1938 in the 1940s when the conservatives regained power in Congress through the [[Conservative Coalition]]. Of special importance is the [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security program]], begun in 1935. The economy basically recovered by 1936, but had a sharp, short recession in 1937\u201338; long-term unemployment, however, remained a problem until it was solved by wartime spending.<ref>David M.

[[Nazi Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]] militarized and threatened conquests, while Britain and France attempted [[appeasement]] to avert another war in Europe. U.S. legislation in the [[Neutrality Acts of 1930s|Neutrality Acts]] sought to avoid foreign conflicts; however, policy clashed with increasing anti-Nazi feelings following the German [[invasion of Poland]] in September 1939 that started World War II. Roosevelt positioned the U.S. as the \"[[Arsenal of Democracy]]\", pledging full-scale financial and munitions support for the Allies&nbsp;\u2013 but no military personnel.<ref>Conrad Black, ''Roosevelt: Champion of Freedom'' (2003) pp 648\u201382</ref> This was carried out through the [[Lend-Lease]] agreements.

Much of the focus in Washington was maximizing the economic output of the nation. The overall result was a dramatic increase in GDP, the export of vast quantities of supplies to the Allies and to American forces overseas, the end of unemployment, and a rise in civilian consumption even as 40% of the GDP went to the war effort. This was achieved by tens of millions of workers moving from low-productivity occupations to high-efficiency jobs, improvements in productivity through better technology and management, and the move into the active labor force of students, retired people, housewives, and the unemployed, and an increase in hours worked.\n\n[[File:Roosevelt Pearl Harbor.ogg|thumb|left|alt=Infamy speech|President Roosevelt's [[Infamy Speech]] in aftermath of [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor Attack]].

This new bill ensures the \"fundamental right to make autonomous decisions about one's own reproductive health,\" specifically the right to choose whether to carry a pregnancy to term or to abort it, and denies a zygote, an embryo, or a fetus \"independent rights under the law\" of the State of Illinois. Pritzker encourages states that have passed restrictions on abortion to reconsider their positions and added that women from other states can seek refuge in his. Pritzker signed this bill at a time when the landmark Supreme Court decision ''[[Roe v.

Funding for grade schools will rise by nearly $379 million, more than the $29 million required by the new state funding for education formula passed the previous year. Funding for community colleges will increase by $14 million, for public universities by $53 million. Grants for low-income students will receive a $50-million bump.

However, because the capital plan relies on tax revenue on gambling and smoking, it will be a while before that money becomes available. For years, public institutions of higher learning in Illinois have struggled financially and have lobbied for increased funding without much success.

Pritzker encourages states that have passed restrictions on abortion to reconsider their positions and added that women from other states can seek refuge in his.

Funding for grade schools will rise by nearly $379 million, more than the $29 million required by the new state funding for education formula passed the previous year. Funding for community colleges will increase by $14 million, for public universities by $53 million. Grants for low-income students will receive a $50-million bump.

For years, public institutions of higher learning in Illinois have struggled financially and have lobbied for increased funding without much success.

The network is owned by [[Corus Entertainment]], which oversees all of the network's national news programming as well as local news on its 15 [[owned-and-operated station]]s.\n\nCorus also operates several [[talk radio]] stations under the \"Global News Radio\" brand. The same division also operates a news website under the same brand.\n\n==National programs==\nGlobal's lineup of national news and current affairs programming is as follows:\n\n* ''[[The Morning Show (Canadian TV series)|The Morning Show]]'': Weekdays 9:00&nbsp;a.m. ET/CT/MT/PT, 10:00&nbsp;a.m. AT\n* ''[[Global National]]'': Nightly 7:30&nbsp;p.m. NT, 6:30&nbsp;p.m. AT/ET, 5:30&nbsp;p.m. CT/MT/PT, 6:00&nbsp;p.m. Kelowna and Montreal\n* ''[[The West Block]]'': Sundays 10:00&nbsp;a.m. PT/MT, 11:00&nbsp;a.m. ET/CT, 12:00 Noon AT\n\nAlthough Global stations had always carried local news in various forms, the first tentative steps towards a national presence came in 1994 with the launch of ''[[First National (television show)|First National]]'' with [[Peter Kent]], an early-evening program focusing on national and international news but airing only in central Canada. After acquiring the [[Western International Communications]] (WIC) group of stations, Global cancelled ''First National'' in February 2001 and briefly aired the similar WIC newscast ''[[Canada Tonight]]'' in its place.\n\nIn September 2001, Global replaced ''Canada Tonight'' with a new network newscast, ''[[Global National]]'', anchored by [[Kevin Newman (Canadian journalist)|Kevin Newman]] until 2010 and [[Dawna Friesen]] since.  It aired from the network's new national news centre at [[CHAN-DT|CHAN-TV]]'s studio in [[Burnaby, British Columbia]]. The program initially aired only on weekdays. In February 2005, it launched a weekend edition anchored by [[Tara Nelson]] until 2008 and [[Robin Gill (journalist)|Robin Gill]] since.\n\nOriginally airing in different timeslots around the country, ''Global National'' moved to a standard 5:30&nbsp;p.m. (6:30&nbsp;p.m. Atlantic) start time nationwide in 2006. Since then, ''Global National'' has gained ground on longtime number-one ''[[CTV National News]]'', overtaking it on several occasions. A [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] version of the newscast, titled ''Global National Mandarin'', launched on January 23, 2012 with anchor Carol Wang, and is seen weeknights on [[Shaw Multicultural Channel]] in Vancouver and Calgary.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/890821/global-news-and-shaw-multicultural-channel-launch-global-national-mandarin-newscast|title=Global News and Shaw Multicultural Channel Launch Global National Mandarin Newscast|work=Global Television / Shaw Media press release|date=December 6, 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn January 7, 2013, the network extended its [[CIII-DT|Toronto owned-and-operated station's]] morning program (''[[The Morning Show (Canadian TV series)|The Morning Show]]'') by 30 minutes, with this additional half-hour airing across its other owned-and-operated stations;<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/1087965/global-news-takes-breakfast-to-new-heights-with-a-national-version-of-the-morning-show|title=Global News Takes Breakfast to New Heights With a National Version of the Morning Show|work=Global Television / Shaw Media press release|date=December 12, 2012|accessdate=December 16, 2012}}</ref> prior to this, Global did not air a national [[morning show]]. In addition, the network's owned-and-operated stations in select markets produce their own local morning shows (see [[#Local programs|below]]); stations which do not produce a local morning show either air the morning show from a larger market, or run daytime programming repeated from [[Shaw Media]]'s cable [[specialty channel]]s, such as ''Crash Test Mommy'' and ''The Mom Show''.\n\nGlobal launched its first investigative [[newsmagazine]] series on November 30, 2008.  The weekly program, titled ''[[16x9 - The Bigger Picture]]'', features a high-gloss, tabloid format, and is the network's first foray into the field long occupied by CTV's ''[[W-FIVE]]'' and CBC's ''[[The Fifth Estate (TV)|the fifth estate]]''. Global also formerly aired a weekly [[Documentary film|documentary]] series, ''[[Global Currents]]''.\n\nDuring the [[2011 Canadian federal election|2011 federal election]], Global News also produced a weekly series, ''Focus: Decision Canada'', covering news and issues in the election campaign. The show, hosted by weekend ''Global National'' anchor Carolyn Jarvis, was a nominee for Best Information Program or Series at the [[2011 Gemini Awards]].\n\n''[[The West Block]]'', a [[Sunday morning talk show|Sunday morning national political affairs show]], debuted on November 6, 2011.<ref name=star>[https://www.thestar.com/news/article/1051766 \"CTV\u2019s Question Period to face competition\"].

The long-dominant [[CHAN-DT|CHAN]] Vancouver (BCTV) had been an exception; its news operation was renamed ''BCTV News on Global'' when it became a Global owned-and-operated in 2001, and its individual newscast titles (e.g. ''News Hour'') were also retained.\n\nAs part of a network-wide branding overhaul, local newscast titles and timeslots were standardized effective February 6, 2006,<ref>[http://www.channelcanada.com/Article1216.html Global News Brings Enhanced National and Local News Package] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090928054053/http://www.channelcanada.com/Article1216.html |date=2009-09-28 }}, Global press release, February 1, 2006.

The only station that did not follow the BCTV model is [[CHBC-TV|CHBC]] Kelowna, which has kept its call sign as part of its news branding. As of 2011, [[CHBC-TV|CHBC]] Kelowna have rebranded their news operations as ''Global News Okanagan''. In April 2016, Global once again rebranded its news programs national-wide dropping the BCTV model.\n\n* ''[[Morning News (Canadian morning TV show)|Global News Morning]]'': weekday and weekend mornings (previously known as ''Morning News'')\n* ''[[News Hour (Canadian news program)|Global News at Noon]]'': weekdays and weekends at noon (previously known as ''Noon News Hour'')\n** Exceptions: ''Scene and Heard'' (non-news regional lifestyle show on [[CISA-TV|CISA]])\n* ''Global News at 5'': weekdays at 5:00 pm (previously known as ''Early News'')\n* ''[[News Hour (Canadian news program)|Global News at 5:30]]'': weekdays at 5:30 pm ([[CIII-DT|Toronto]] and [[CKMI-DT|Montreal]]<nowiki/>)\n* ''[[News Hour (Canadian news program)|Global News Hour at 6]]'': nightly at 6:00 pm (previously known as ''News Hour'') \n* ''Global News at 6:30'': weeknights at 6:30 pm ([[CHBC-DT|Okanagan]]) and ([[CKMI-DT|Montreal]])\n* ''[[News Hour (Canadian news program)|Global News at 10]]'' or ''[[News Hour (Canadian news program)|Global News at 11]]'': nightly at 10:00 pm ([[CKND-DT|Winnipeg]], [[CFRE-DT|Regina]], and [[CFSK-DT|Saskatoon]]) or 11:00 pm (previously known as ''News Hour Final'' or ''News Final'')\n* ''Focus'': Weekends (Regina/Saskatoon, Winnipeg, Toronto, Montreal, BC)\n\nOn October 4, 2007, Global's then-parent company [[Canwest]] announced it would be centralizing [[Television studio#Production control room|news production control room]] functions for all owned-and-operated stations (except [[CHBC-TV|CHBC]] [[Kelowna]]) at four broadcast centres - [[CHAN-DT|CHAN]] [[Vancouver]], [[CITV-DT|CITV]] [[Edmonton]], [[CICT-DT|CICT]] [[Calgary]], and [[CIII-DT|CIII]] [[Toronto]]. The company stated this would allow all of its stations to make a transition to high definition broadcasting, and create around 50 new jobs at the four stations. Approximately 250 positions were to be eliminated in the other stations, the majority of which were behind-the-scenes/technical positions.<ref>{{cite news |title=CanWest To Launch State-of-the-Art Broadcast Centres; Cuts Jobs |url=http://www.channelcanada.com/Article2018.html |accessdate=12 April 2019 |work=Channel Canada |date=4 October 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321225015/http://www.channelcanada.com/Article2018.html |archivedate=21 March 2012 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nA press release from the company has also stated that on-air talent (including weather anchors), reporters, producers, photographers, editors, and other news gathering positions will remain at the affected stations. Global Edmonton took over production of Global Maritimes' newscasts in mid-August 2008, and on September 4, 2008, took over production of all newscasts at [[CHCA-TV]] (the [[E! (Canadian TV system)|E!]] station in [[Red Deer, Alberta]]). Global Calgary began production of Global Lethbridge's newscasts in mid-September, and later in the year Global BC took over CHEK Victoria, Global Regina, Global Saskatoon, Global Winnipeg and Global Montreal. In August 2009, production for Global News Montreal moved from Vancouver to Edmonton. The stations whose controls were taken over began using [[virtual set]]s. In September 2009, CHBC's controls were moved to Calgary (master control) and Vancouver (production control), and the station launched its own virtual set in July 2010.\n\nOn May 31, 2011, Shaw Media announced that new weekday local morning shows would be launched on Global Toronto, [[CKND-DT|Global Winnipeg]], [[CFSK-DT|Global Saskatoon]], [[CFRE-DT|Global Regina]] and [[CIHF-DT|Global Maritimes]] in late 2011. Local Sunday morning newscasts were also announced for Global Edmonton and Global Calgary, which launched in September 2011. The increase in news programming is part of a benefits package that Shaw Media has promised to fulfill as a condition to purchasing the network.<ref name=\"PR110531\">[http://newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/May2011/31/c9068.html Global News redefines morning television in Toronto with The Morning Show featuring the return of Liza Fromer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110702093852/http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/May2011/31/c9068.html |date=2011-07-02 }}, Global press release, May 31, 2011.

The previously announced weekday morning newscasts on Global Montreal and Global Maritimes were also confirmed to launch in fall 2012 on dates yet to be determined (their launches were later postponed to early 2013). Local morning newscasts on Global BC, Global Edmonton and Global Calgary were also expanded, with the weekday morning newscasts on all three stations lengthened to four hours on August 27, and the Sunday morning news programs expanding to three hours starting September 2, 2012.  ''16:9'' was also moved from Saturdays to Friday nights, and Global News' website also received a redesign in early 2013 with compatibility for mobile devices in mind.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastermagazine.com/broadcasting/global-news-boosts-local-programming-across-the-country/1001418952/|title=Global News Boosts Local Programming Across the Country|publisher=Broadcaster Magazine|date=May 30, 2012|accessdate=April 3, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602051414/http://www.broadcastermagazine.com/broadcasting/global-news-boosts-local-programming-across-the-country/1001418952/|archivedate=June 2, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Centralization ===\nOn April 9, 2015, Shaw announced cutbacks of Global's local news operations and a subsequent re-organization. Under these changes, which began to take effect in August 2015, production of late night and weekend newscasts in markets outside of Calgary, Edmonton, Vancouver, and Toronto, are centralized out of Global's studios in Toronto. Anchors and meteorologists are provided by the centralized news operation, while local stories are presented by the station's reporters.<ref name=faguy-faking>{{cite web|last1=Faguy|first1=Steve|title=Another step in Global\u2019s faking of local news|url=http://blog.fagstein.com/2015/08/17/global-outsourced-news-review/|accessdate=9 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nLocal morning shows in these markets also switched to a hybrid local/national format with an eight-minute long national segment every half-hour. Local morning shows and evening newscasts otherwise continue to be produced locally. Troy Reeb, Global's senior vice president of news and station operations, explained that these changes would allow individual stations to devote more resources to the creation of local news content for television and digital platforms, and reduce redundancy in their coverage of national headlines. Reeb also explained that the changes were meant to allow staff reductions, whilst allowing the network to \"find innovative ways\" to distribute news content; at least 80 jobs were lost nationwide as part of the process.<ref name=global-2015changes>{{cite web|title=Global News announces significant changes to how news is produced|url=http://globalnews.ca/news/1930342/global-news-announces-significant-changes-to-how-news-is-produced/|website=Global News|accessdate=9 April 2015}}</ref><ref name=gazette-globalchanges>{{cite news|last1=Faguy|first1=Steve|title=Global TV cuts staff in Montreal, will anchor some local newscasts from Toronto|url=https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/television/global-tv-cuts-staff-in-montreal-will-anchor-some-local-newscasts-from-toronto|accessdate=26 April 2015|work=Montreal Gazette|date=April 21, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2015, Global announced that it had acquired Canadian rights to ''[[The Late Show with Stephen Colbert]]''. Late newscasts were kept at or shortened to 35 minutes in markets where ''The Late Show'' was to air in simulcast with [[CBS]] at 11:35&nbsp;p.m. for [[simsub]] purposes, including Halifax, Kelowna, Montreal, New Brunswick, Toronto, and Vancouver. Shaw had previously announced that it would extend its late newscasts in Halifax, Montreal, and New Brunswick to a full hour; to compensate for the change, Global Montreal instead introduced a half-hour noon newscast, and expanded its evening news to an hour. In markets with hour-long late newscasts, ''The Late Show'' is tape-delayed to air at the top of the hour instead.<ref name=gazette-mtlnews>{{cite news|last1=Faguy|first1=Steve|title=Global Montreal adding more local newscasts this fall|url=https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/television/global-montreal-adding-more-local-newscasts-this-fall|accessdate=5 June 2015|work=Montreal Gazette}}</ref><ref name=fagstein-lateshowchanges>{{cite web|title=Global Montreal planning a noon local newscast this fall (but why?)|url=http://blog.fagstein.com/2015/06/03/global-montreal-planning-a-noon-local-newscast/|website=Fagstein|accessdate=5 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nCentralization of news anchors has been partially reverted as of January 2019. 11pm newscasts east of Toronto are still anchored from Toronto, however Global Regina, Global Saskatoon, and Global Winnipeg no longer use Toronto anchors for their 10pm local newscasts. Global Regina and Global Saskatoon have since centralized their newscast production, with all of Global Saskatoon's newscasts, with the exception of ''Global News Morning'', being anchored out of Regina.

Similar to the proposed Global News 1 concept, users can select their region from a list of Global markets to receive local news and weather in the ticker on the side of the screen. The content of the newscasts are nationally produced using Global's multi-market anchors in [[CIII-DT|Toronto]] and Global BC1's anchors. If a local market is selected, the feed will be replaced with that market's local newscast at their scheduled airing times. Currently, feeds from [[Global BC|BC]], [[Global Edmonton|Edmonton]], [[Global Calgary|Calgary]], and [[Global Toronto|Toronto]] are available, with more to come. Unlike the other channels available for streaming on Global TV, the Global News channel does not require a sign-in by a [[Cable television|TV provider]] and can be accessed completely free of charge.<ref>https://globalnews.ca/news/6610229/global-tv-app/</ref>\n\n== Global News Radio ==\nIn 2017, Corus Radio began to re-brand [[news talk]] and [[all-news]] radio stations in major markets under the banner '''Global News Radio''' to create [[synergy|synergies]] with its television news programming.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.allaccess.com/net-news/archive/story/177034/chqt-inews-880-edmonton-rebrands-today-as-global-n|title=CHQT (iNews 880)/Edmonton Rebrands Today As Global News Radio 880 Edmonton|work=All Access|access-date=2018-05-30|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://cartt.ca/article/corus-rebrands-another-news-talk-station|title=Corus rebrands another news-talk station|work=Cartt.ca|access-date=2018-05-30|language=en}}</ref>\n\nCurrent stations operating under the branding include:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The network is owned by [[Corus Entertainment]], which oversees all of the network's national news programming as well as local news on its 15 [[owned-and-operated station]]s.\n\nCorus also operates several [[talk radio]] stations under the \"Global News Radio\" brand. The same division also operates a news website under the same brand.\n\n==National programs==\nGlobal's lineup of national news and current affairs programming is as follows:\n\n* ''[[The Morning Show (Canadian TV series)|The Morning Show]]'': Weekdays 9:00&nbsp;a.m. ET/CT/MT/PT, 10:00&nbsp;a.m. AT\n* ''[[Global National]]'': Nightly 7:30&nbsp;p.m. NT, 6:30&nbsp;p.m. AT/ET, 5:30&nbsp;p.m. CT/MT/PT, 6:00&nbsp;p.m. Kelowna and Montreal\n* ''[[The West Block]]'': Sundays 10:00&nbsp;a.m. PT/MT, 11:00&nbsp;a.m. ET/CT, 12:00 Noon AT\n\nAlthough Global stations had always carried local news in various forms, the first tentative steps towards a national presence came in 1994 with the launch of ''[[First National (television show)|First National]]'' with [[Peter Kent]], an early-evening program focusing on national and international news but airing only in central Canada. After acquiring the [[Western International Communications]] (WIC) group of stations, Global cancelled ''First National'' in February 2001 and briefly aired the similar WIC newscast ''[[Canada Tonight]]'' in its place.\n\nIn September 2001, Global replaced ''Canada Tonight'' with a new network newscast, ''[[Global National]]'', anchored by [[Kevin Newman (Canadian journalist)|Kevin Newman]] until 2010 and [[Dawna Friesen]] since.  It aired from the network's new national news centre at [[CHAN-DT|CHAN-TV]]'s studio in [[Burnaby, British Columbia]]. The program initially aired only on weekdays. In February 2005, it launched a weekend edition anchored by [[Tara Nelson]] until 2008 and [[Robin Gill (journalist)|Robin Gill]] since.\n\nOriginally airing in different timeslots around the country, ''Global National'' moved to a standard 5:30&nbsp;p.m. (6:30&nbsp;p.m. Atlantic) start time nationwide in 2006. Since then, ''Global National'' has gained ground on longtime number-one ''[[CTV National News]]'', overtaking it on several occasions. A [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] version of the newscast, titled ''Global National Mandarin'', launched on January 23, 2012 with anchor Carol Wang, and is seen weeknights on [[Shaw Multicultural Channel]] in Vancouver and Calgary.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/890821/global-news-and-shaw-multicultural-channel-launch-global-national-mandarin-newscast|title=Global News and Shaw Multicultural Channel Launch Global National Mandarin Newscast|work=Global Television / Shaw Media press release|date=December 6, 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn January 7, 2013, the network extended its [[CIII-DT|Toronto owned-and-operated station's]] morning program (''[[The Morning Show (Canadian TV series)|The Morning Show]]'') by 30 minutes, with this additional half-hour airing across its other owned-and-operated stations;<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/1087965/global-news-takes-breakfast-to-new-heights-with-a-national-version-of-the-morning-show|title=Global News Takes Breakfast to New Heights With a National Version of the Morning Show|work=Global Television / Shaw Media press release|date=December 12, 2012|accessdate=December 16, 2012}}</ref> prior to this, Global did not air a national [[morning show]]. In addition, the network's owned-and-operated stations in select markets produce their own local morning shows (see [[#Local programs|below]]); stations which do not produce a local morning show either air the morning show from a larger market, or run daytime programming repeated from [[Shaw Media]]'s cable [[specialty channel]]s, such as ''Crash Test Mommy'' and ''The Mom Show''.\n\nGlobal launched its first investigative [[newsmagazine]] series on November 30, 2008.  The weekly program, titled ''[[16x9 - The Bigger Picture]]'', features a high-gloss, tabloid format, and is the network's first foray into the field long occupied by CTV's ''[[W-FIVE]]'' and CBC's ''[[The Fifth Estate (TV)|the fifth estate]]''. Global also formerly aired a weekly [[Documentary film|documentary]] series, ''[[Global Currents]]''.\n\nDuring the [[2011 Canadian federal election|2011 federal election]], Global News also produced a weekly series, ''Focus: Decision Canada'', covering news and issues in the election campaign.

The long-dominant [[CHAN-DT|CHAN]] Vancouver (BCTV) had been an exception; its news operation was renamed ''BCTV News on Global'' when it became a Global owned-and-operated in 2001, and its individual newscast titles (e.g. ''News Hour'') were also retained.\n\nAs part of a network-wide branding overhaul, local newscast titles and timeslots were standardized effective February 6, 2006,<ref>[http://www.channelcanada.com/Article1216.html Global News Brings Enhanced National and Local News Package] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090928054053/http://www.channelcanada.com/Article1216.html |date=2009-09-28 }}, Global press release, February 1, 2006.

The only station that did not follow the BCTV model is [[CHBC-TV|CHBC]] Kelowna, which has kept its call sign as part of its news branding. As of 2011, [[CHBC-TV|CHBC]] Kelowna have rebranded their news operations as ''Global News Okanagan''.

The company stated this would allow all of its stations to make a transition to high definition broadcasting, and create around 50 new jobs at the four stations. Approximately 250 positions were to be eliminated in the other stations, the majority of which were behind-the-scenes/technical positions.<ref>{{cite news |title=CanWest To Launch State-of-the-Art Broadcast Centres; Cuts Jobs |url=http://www.channelcanada.com/Article2018.html |accessdate=12 April 2019 |work=Channel Canada |date=4 October 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321225015/http://www.channelcanada.com/Article2018.html |archivedate=21 March 2012 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nA press release from the company has also stated that on-air talent (including weather anchors), reporters, producers, photographers, editors, and other news gathering positions will remain at the affected stations. Global Edmonton took over production of Global Maritimes' newscasts in mid-August 2008, and on September 4, 2008, took over production of all newscasts at [[CHCA-TV]] (the [[E! (Canadian TV system)|E!]] station in [[Red Deer, Alberta]]). Global Calgary began production of Global Lethbridge's newscasts in mid-September, and later in the year Global BC took over CHEK Victoria, Global Regina, Global Saskatoon, Global Winnipeg and Global Montreal. In August 2009, production for Global News Montreal moved from Vancouver to Edmonton. The stations whose controls were taken over began using [[virtual set]]s. In September 2009, CHBC's controls were moved to Calgary (master control) and Vancouver (production control), and the station launched its own virtual set in July 2010.\n\nOn May 31, 2011, Shaw Media announced that new weekday local morning shows would be launched on Global Toronto, [[CKND-DT|Global Winnipeg]], [[CFSK-DT|Global Saskatoon]], [[CFRE-DT|Global Regina]] and [[CIHF-DT|Global Maritimes]] in late 2011. Local Sunday morning newscasts were also announced for Global Edmonton and Global Calgary, which launched in September 2011. The increase in news programming is part of a benefits package that Shaw Media has promised to fulfill as a condition to purchasing the network.<ref name=\"PR110531\">[http://newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/May2011/31/c9068.html Global News redefines morning television in Toronto with The Morning Show featuring the return of Liza Fromer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110702093852/http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/May2011/31/c9068.html |date=2011-07-02 }}, Global press release, May 31, 2011.

The previously announced weekday morning newscasts on Global Montreal and Global Maritimes were also confirmed to launch in fall 2012 on dates yet to be determined (their launches were later postponed to early 2013). Local morning newscasts on Global BC, Global Edmonton and Global Calgary were also expanded, with the weekday morning newscasts on all three stations lengthened to four hours on August 27, and the Sunday morning news programs expanding to three hours starting September 2, 2012.  ''16:9'' was also moved from Saturdays to Friday nights, and Global News' website also received a redesign in early 2013 with compatibility for mobile devices in mind.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastermagazine.com/broadcasting/global-news-boosts-local-programming-across-the-country/1001418952/|title=Global News Boosts Local Programming Across the Country|publisher=Broadcaster Magazine|date=May 30, 2012|accessdate=April 3, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602051414/http://www.broadcastermagazine.com/broadcasting/global-news-boosts-local-programming-across-the-country/1001418952/|archivedate=June 2, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Centralization ===\nOn April 9, 2015, Shaw announced cutbacks of Global's local news operations and a subsequent re-organization. Under these changes, which began to take effect in August 2015, production of late night and weekend newscasts in markets outside of Calgary, Edmonton, Vancouver, and Toronto, are centralized out of Global's studios in Toronto. Anchors and meteorologists are provided by the centralized news operation, while local stories are presented by the station's reporters.<ref name=faguy-faking>{{cite web|last1=Faguy|first1=Steve|title=Another step in Global\u2019s faking of local news|url=http://blog.fagstein.com/2015/08/17/global-outsourced-news-review/|accessdate=9 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nLocal morning shows in these markets also switched to a hybrid local/national format with an eight-minute long national segment every half-hour. Local morning shows and evening newscasts otherwise continue to be produced locally. Troy Reeb, Global's senior vice president of news and station operations, explained that these changes would allow individual stations to devote more resources to the creation of local news content for television and digital platforms, and reduce redundancy in their coverage of national headlines. Reeb also explained that the changes were meant to allow staff reductions, whilst allowing the network to \"find innovative ways\" to distribute news content; at least 80 jobs were lost nationwide as part of the process.<ref name=global-2015changes>{{cite web|title=Global News announces significant changes to how news is produced|url=http://globalnews.ca/news/1930342/global-news-announces-significant-changes-to-how-news-is-produced/|website=Global News|accessdate=9 April 2015}}</ref><ref name=gazette-globalchanges>{{cite news|last1=Faguy|first1=Steve|title=Global TV cuts staff in Montreal, will anchor some local newscasts from Toronto|url=https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/television/global-tv-cuts-staff-in-montreal-will-anchor-some-local-newscasts-from-toronto|accessdate=26 April 2015|work=Montreal Gazette|date=April 21, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2015, Global announced that it had acquired Canadian rights to ''[[The Late Show with Stephen Colbert]]''.

Shaw had previously announced that it would extend its late newscasts in Halifax, Montreal, and New Brunswick to a full hour; to compensate for the change, Global Montreal instead introduced a half-hour noon newscast, and expanded its evening news to an hour. In markets with hour-long late newscasts, ''The Late Show'' is tape-delayed to air at the top of the hour instead.<ref name=gazette-mtlnews>{{cite news|last1=Faguy|first1=Steve|title=Global Montreal adding more local newscasts this fall|url=https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/television/global-montreal-adding-more-local-newscasts-this-fall|accessdate=5 June 2015|work=Montreal Gazette}}</ref><ref name=fagstein-lateshowchanges>{{cite web|title=Global Montreal planning a noon local newscast this fall (but why?)|url=http://blog.fagstein.com/2015/06/03/global-montreal-planning-a-noon-local-newscast/|website=Fagstein|accessdate=5 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nCentralization of news anchors has been partially reverted as of January 2019. 11pm newscasts east of Toronto are still anchored from Toronto, however Global Regina, Global Saskatoon, and Global Winnipeg no longer use Toronto anchors for their 10pm local newscasts. Global Regina and Global Saskatoon have since centralized their newscast production, with all of Global Saskatoon's newscasts, with the exception of ''Global News Morning'', being anchored out of Regina.

The content of the newscasts are nationally produced using Global's multi-market anchors in [[CIII-DT|Toronto]] and Global BC1's anchors. If a local market is selected, the feed will be replaced with that market's local newscast at their scheduled airing times. Currently, feeds from [[Global BC|BC]], [[Global Edmonton|Edmonton]], [[Global Calgary|Calgary]], and [[Global Toronto|Toronto]] are available, with more to come.
