Henry acquired an increasing role in England's government due to the king's declining health, but disagreements between father and son led to political conflict between the two. After his father's death in 1413, Henry assumed control of the country and asserted the pending [[English claim to the French throne]].\n\nIn 1415, [[Hundred Years' War (1415\u201353)|Henry embarked on war with France]] in the ongoing Hundred Years' War (1337\u20131453) between the two nations. His military successes culminated in his famous victory at the [[Battle of Agincourt]] (1415) and saw him come close to conquering France. Taking advantage of political divisions within France, he conquered large portions of the kingdom, resulting in [[Normandy]]'s occupation by the English for the first time since 1345\u20131360. After months of negotiation with [[Charles VI of France]], the [[Treaty of Troyes]] (1420) recognised Henry V as regent and [[heir apparent]] to the French throne, and he was subsequently married to Charles's daughter, [[Catherine of Valois]]. Everything seemed to point to the formation of a [[Dual monarchy of England and France|union between the kingdoms]], [[Personal union|in the person]] of Henry. However, he died two years later and was succeeded by his only child, the infant [[King Henry VI]].\n\n==Early life==\nHenry was born in the tower above the gatehouse of [[Monmouth Castle]] in [[Wales]], and for that reason was sometimes called Henry of Monmouth.<ref>{{cite web |last=Allmand |date=23 September 2010 |first=C. |title=Henry V (1386\u20131422) |url=https://archive.is/klEKs |work=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] |type=online |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/12952 |ref=harv }}</ref> He was the son of Henry of Bolingbroke (later [[Henry IV of England]]) and [[Mary de Bohun]].

From January 1410, helped by his uncles Henry Beaufort and [[Thomas Beaufort]], legitimised sons of John of Gaunt, he had practical control of the government.<ref name=EB1911/> Both in foreign and domestic policy he differed from the king, who discharged his son from the council in November 1411. The quarrel of father and son was political only, though it is probable that the Beauforts had discussed the abdication of Henry IV. Their opponents certainly endeavoured to defame Prince Henry.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n===Supposed riotous youth===\nIt may be that the tradition of Henry's riotous youth, immortalised by [[Shakespeare]], is partly due to political enmity. Henry's record of involvement in war and politics, even in his youth, disproves this tradition. The most famous incident, his quarrel with the chief justice, has no contemporary authority and was first related by Sir [[Thomas Elyot]] in 1531.<ref name=EB1911/><ref name= \"Weis1998\">{{Cite book| last= Weis| first= Ren\u00e9| title= Henry IV, part 2| year= 1998| publisher= Oxford University Press | location = Oxford, England | isbn = 0-19-283143-7 | page =27|chapter=Introduction}}</ref>\n\nThe story of [[Falstaff]] originated in Henry's early friendship with Sir [[John Oldcastle]], a supporter of the [[Lollards]]. Shakespeare's Falstaff was originally named \"Oldcastle\", following his main source, ''[[The Famous Victories of Henry V]]''. His descendants objected and the name was changed (the character became a composite of several real persons, including Sir [[John Fastolf]]). That friendship, and the prince's political opposition to [[Thomas Arundel]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], perhaps encouraged Lollard hopes. If so, their disappointment may account for the statements of ecclesiastical writers like [[Thomas Walsingham]] that Henry on becoming king was suddenly changed into a new man.<ref>{{Cite book| last= Patterson| first= Annabel| editor1-last = Hamilton | editor1-first = Donna | editor2-last = Strier | editor2-first = Richard| title= Religion, literature, and politics in post-Reformation England, 1540\u20131688| year= 1996| publisher= Cambridge University Press| location= Cambridge, England| isbn= 0-521-47456-6| pages= 8\u201312| chapter= Sir John Oldcastle and Reformation histiography}}</ref><ref name=EB1911/>\n\n==Reign==\n===Accession===\nAfter Henry IV died on 20 March 1413, Henry V succeeded him and was crowned on 9 April 1413 at [[Westminster Abbey]].

A writer of the next generation was the first to allege that Henry was encouraged by [[ecclesiastical]] statesmen to enter into the French war as a means of diverting attention from home troubles. This story seems to have no foundation. Old commercial disputes and the support the French had lent to Owain Glynd\u0175r were used as an excuse for war, while the disordered state of France afforded no security for peace.<ref name=EB1911/> The French king, [[Charles VI of France|Charles VI]], was prone to mental illness; at times he thought he was made of glass, and [[Louis, Duke of Guyenne|his eldest surviving son]] was an unpromising prospect.

Despite his men-at-arms being exhausted, outnumbered and malnourished, Henry led his men into battle, decisively [[Battle of Agincourt|defeating the French]], who suffered severe losses. It is often argued that the French men-at-arms were bogged down in the muddy battlefield, soaked from the previous night of heavy rain, and that this hindered the French advance, allowing them to be sitting targets for the flanking English and Welsh archers. Most were simply hacked to death while completely stuck in the deep mud. Nevertheless, the victory is seen as Henry's greatest, ranking alongside the [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy]] (1346) and the [[Battle of Poitiers]] (1356) as the greatest English victories of the Hundred Years' War.\n\nDuring the battle,<ref>{{Cite book| last= Hibbert| first= Christopher| authorlink= Christopher Hibbert| title= Agincourt| year= 1964| publisher= Batsford| location= London| page= 114| chapter = During the battle| oclc = 460624273}}</ref> Henry ordered that the French prisoners taken during the battle be put to death, including some of the most illustrious who could have been used for ransom.  Cambridge historian Brett Tingley posits that Henry was concerned that the prisoners might turn on their captors when the English were busy repelling a third wave of enemy troops, thus jeopardising a hard-fought victory.\n\nThe victorious conclusion of Agincourt, from the English viewpoint, was only the first step in the campaign to recover the French possessions that he felt belonged to the English crown. Agincourt also held out the promise that Henry's pretensions to the French throne might be realised.\n\n=====Diplomacy and command of the sea=====\nCommand of the sea was secured by driving the [[Genoa|Genoese]] allies of the French out of the [[English Channel]].<ref name=EB1911/> While Henry was occupied with peace negotiations in 1416, a French and Genoese fleet surrounded the harbour at the English-garrisoned Harfleur. A French land force also besieged the town. To relieve Harfleur, Henry sent his brother, [[John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford|John of Lancaster]], [[Duke of Bedford]], who raised a fleet and set sail from [[Beachy Head]] on 14 August. The Franco-Genoese fleet was defeated the following day after a gruelling seven-hour battle and Harfleur was relieved. Diplomacy successfully detached [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Sigismund]] from France and the [[Treaty of Canterbury (1416)|Treaty of Canterbury]] in 1416 paved the way to end the [[Western Schism]] in the Church.\n\n=====1417\u201320 campaign=====\n[[File:Marriage of henry and Catherine.jpg|thumb|Late 15th-century depiction of Henry's marriage to [[Catherine of Valois]].

After [[Siege of Caen (1417)|taking Caen]], Lower [[Normandy]] was quickly conquered and [[Rouen]] was cut off from Paris and besieged. [[Siege of Rouen|This siege]] cast an even darker shadow on the reputation of the king than his order to slay the French prisoners at Agincourt. Rouen, starving and unable to support the women and children of the town, forced them out through the gates believing that Henry would allow them to pass through his army unmolested. However, Henry refused to allow this, and the expelled women and children died of starvation in the ditches surrounding the town. The French were paralysed by the [[Armagnac\u2013Burgundian Civil War|disputes]] between [[Burgundian (party)|Burgundians]] and [[Armagnac (party)|Armagnacs]].

From June to July 1420, Henry's army besieged and took the military fortress castle at Montereau-Fault-Yonne close to Paris. He besieged and captured [[Melun]] in November 1420, returning to England shortly thereafter. In 1428, Charles VII retook Montereau-Fault-Yonne, to once again see the English take it over within a short time. Finally, on 10 October 1437, Charles VII was victorious in regaining Montereau-Fault-Yonne.\n\n=====1421 campaign=====\nWhile he was in England, Henry's brother [[Thomas of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Clarence]], led the English forces in France. On 22 March 1421, Thomas led the English to a disastrous defeat at the [[Battle of Baug\u00e9]] against a Franco-Scottish army. The duke was killed in the battle. On 10 June, Henry sailed back to France to retrieve the situation. It would be his last military campaign. From July to August, Henry's forces besieged and captured [[Dreux]], thus relieving allied forces at [[Chartres]].

Henry acquired an increasing role in England's government due to the king's declining health, but disagreements between father and son led to political conflict between the two. After his father's death in 1413, Henry assumed control of the country and asserted the pending [[English claim to the French throne]].\n\nIn 1415, [[Hundred Years' War (1415\u201353)|Henry embarked on war with France]] in the ongoing Hundred Years' War (1337\u20131453) between the two nations. His military successes culminated in his famous victory at the [[Battle of Agincourt]] (1415) and saw him come close to conquering France. Taking advantage of political divisions within France, he conquered large portions of the kingdom, resulting in [[Normandy]]'s occupation by the English for the first time since 1345\u20131360. After months of negotiation with [[Charles VI of France]], the [[Treaty of Troyes]] (1420) recognised Henry V as regent and [[heir apparent]] to the French throne, and he was subsequently married to Charles's daughter, [[Catherine of Valois]]. Everything seemed to point to the formation of a [[Dual monarchy of England and France|union between the kingdoms]], [[Personal union|in the person]] of Henry. However, he died two years later and was succeeded by his only child, the infant [[King Henry VI]].\n\n==Early life==\nHenry was born in the tower above the gatehouse of [[Monmouth Castle]] in [[Wales]], and for that reason was sometimes called Henry of Monmouth.<ref>{{cite web |last=Allmand |date=23 September 2010 |first=C. |title=Henry V (1386\u20131422) |url=https://archive.is/klEKs |work=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] |type=online |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/12952 |ref=harv }}</ref> He was the son of Henry of Bolingbroke (later [[Henry IV of England]]) and [[Mary de Bohun]].

Their opponents certainly endeavoured to defame Prince Henry.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n===Supposed riotous youth===\nIt may be that the tradition of Henry's riotous youth, immortalised by [[Shakespeare]], is partly due to political enmity. Henry's record of involvement in war and politics, even in his youth, disproves this tradition. The most famous incident, his quarrel with the chief justice, has no contemporary authority and was first related by Sir [[Thomas Elyot]] in 1531.<ref name=EB1911/><ref name= \"Weis1998\">{{Cite book| last= Weis| first= Ren\u00e9| title= Henry IV, part 2| year= 1998| publisher= Oxford University Press | location = Oxford, England | isbn = 0-19-283143-7 | page =27|chapter=Introduction}}</ref>\n\nThe story of [[Falstaff]] originated in Henry's early friendship with Sir [[John Oldcastle]], a supporter of the [[Lollards]]. Shakespeare's Falstaff was originally named \"Oldcastle\", following his main source, ''[[The Famous Victories of Henry V]]''. His descendants objected and the name was changed (the character became a composite of several real persons, including Sir [[John Fastolf]]). That friendship, and the prince's political opposition to [[Thomas Arundel]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], perhaps encouraged Lollard hopes. If so, their disappointment may account for the statements of ecclesiastical writers like [[Thomas Walsingham]] that Henry on becoming king was suddenly changed into a new man.<ref>{{Cite book| last= Patterson| first= Annabel| editor1-last = Hamilton | editor1-first = Donna | editor2-last = Strier | editor2-first = Richard| title= Religion, literature, and politics in post-Reformation England, 1540\u20131688| year= 1996| publisher= Cambridge University Press| location= Cambridge, England| isbn= 0-521-47456-6| pages= 8\u201312| chapter= Sir John Oldcastle and Reformation histiography}}</ref><ref name=EB1911/>\n\n==Reign==\n===Accession===\nAfter Henry IV died on 20 March 1413, Henry V succeeded him and was crowned on 9 April 1413 at [[Westminster Abbey]].

A writer of the next generation was the first to allege that Henry was encouraged by [[ecclesiastical]] statesmen to enter into the French war as a means of diverting attention from home troubles. This story seems to have no foundation. Old commercial disputes and the support the French had lent to Owain Glynd\u0175r were used as an excuse for war, while the disordered state of France afforded no security for peace.<ref name=EB1911/> The French king, [[Charles VI of France|Charles VI]], was prone to mental illness; at times he thought he was made of glass, and [[Louis, Duke of Guyenne|his eldest surviving son]] was an unpromising prospect. However, it was [[English claims to the French throne|the old dynastic claim to the throne of France]], first pursued by [[Edward III of England]], that justified war with France in English opinion.\n\nFollowing the [[Battle of Agincourt]], [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]], then [[King of Hungary]] and later [[Holy Roman Emperor]], made a visit to Henry in hopes of making peace between England and France. His goal was to persuade Henry to modify his demands against the French. Henry lavishly entertained the emperor and even had him enrolled in the [[Order of the Garter]].

Despite his men-at-arms being exhausted, outnumbered and malnourished, Henry led his men into battle, decisively [[Battle of Agincourt|defeating the French]], who suffered severe losses. It is often argued that the French men-at-arms were bogged down in the muddy battlefield, soaked from the previous night of heavy rain, and that this hindered the French advance, allowing them to be sitting targets for the flanking English and Welsh archers. Most were simply hacked to death while completely stuck in the deep mud. Nevertheless, the victory is seen as Henry's greatest, ranking alongside the [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy]] (1346) and the [[Battle of Poitiers]] (1356) as the greatest English victories of the Hundred Years' War.\n\nDuring the battle,<ref>{{Cite book| last= Hibbert| first= Christopher| authorlink= Christopher Hibbert| title= Agincourt| year= 1964| publisher= Batsford| location= London| page= 114| chapter = During the battle| oclc = 460624273}}</ref> Henry ordered that the French prisoners taken during the battle be put to death, including some of the most illustrious who could have been used for ransom.  Cambridge historian Brett Tingley posits that Henry was concerned that the prisoners might turn on their captors when the English were busy repelling a third wave of enemy troops, thus jeopardising a hard-fought victory.\n\nThe victorious conclusion of Agincourt, from the English viewpoint, was only the first step in the campaign to recover the French possessions that he felt belonged to the English crown. Agincourt also held out the promise that Henry's pretensions to the French throne might be realised.\n\n=====Diplomacy and command of the sea=====\nCommand of the sea was secured by driving the [[Genoa|Genoese]] allies of the French out of the [[English Channel]].<ref name=EB1911/> While Henry was occupied with peace negotiations in 1416, a French and Genoese fleet surrounded the harbour at the English-garrisoned Harfleur. A French land force also besieged the town. To relieve Harfleur, Henry sent his brother, [[John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford|John of Lancaster]], [[Duke of Bedford]], who raised a fleet and set sail from [[Beachy Head]] on 14 August. The Franco-Genoese fleet was defeated the following day after a gruelling seven-hour battle and Harfleur was relieved. Diplomacy successfully detached [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Sigismund]] from France and the [[Treaty of Canterbury (1416)|Treaty of Canterbury]] in 1416 paved the way to end the [[Western Schism]] in the Church.\n\n=====1417\u201320 campaign=====\n[[File:Marriage of henry and Catherine.jpg|thumb|Late 15th-century depiction of Henry's marriage to [[Catherine of Valois]]. [[British Library]], London.]]\n\nWith those two potential enemies gone, and after two years of patient preparation following the Battle of Agincourt, Henry renewed the war on a larger scale in 1417. After [[Siege of Caen (1417)|taking Caen]], Lower [[Normandy]] was quickly conquered and [[Rouen]] was cut off from Paris and besieged. [[Siege of Rouen|This siege]] cast an even darker shadow on the reputation of the king than his order to slay the French prisoners at Agincourt. Rouen, starving and unable to support the women and children of the town, forced them out through the gates believing that Henry would allow them to pass through his army unmolested. However, Henry refused to allow this, and the expelled women and children died of starvation in the ditches surrounding the town. The French were paralysed by the [[Armagnac\u2013Burgundian Civil War|disputes]] between [[Burgundian (party)|Burgundians]] and [[Armagnac (party)|Armagnacs]]. Henry skilfully played them off one against the other without relaxing his warlike approach.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nIn January 1419, Rouen fell.<ref name=EB1911/> Those Norman French who had resisted were severely punished: [[Alain Blanchard]], who had hanged English prisoners from the walls of Rouen, was summarily executed; Robert de Livet, [[Rouen Cathedral|Canon of Rouen]], who had excommunicated the English king, was packed off to England and imprisoned for five years.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kingsford |date=1901 |first=C. |title=Henry V: The Typical Medi\u00e6val Hero |url=https://archive.org/details/henryvtypicalmed00kinguoft |publisher=GP Putnam's Sons |authorlink=Charles Lethbridge Kingsford |ref=harv }}</ref>\n\nBy August, the English were outside the walls of [[Paris]]. The intrigues of the French parties culminated in the [[assassination of John the Fearless]], [[Duke of Burgundy]], by the [[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]]'s partisans at [[Montereau-Fault-Yonne|Montereau]] on 10 September. [[Philip the Good]], the new duke, and the French court threw themselves into Henry's arms. After six months of negotiation, the [[Treaty of Troyes]] recognised Henry as the heir and regent of France (see [[English Kings of France]]),<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911 |last=Kingsford |first=C. |display=Henry V (1387\u20131422) |volume=13 |wstitle=Henry V. of England |authorlink=Charles Lethbridge Kingsford<!-- |editorlink=Hugh Chisholm--> |mode=cs2 |inline=1}}</ref> and on 2 June 1420 at [[Troyes Cathedral]], he married [[Catherine of Valois]], the French king's daughter. They had only one son, Henry, born on 6 December 1421 at [[Windsor Castle]]. From June to July 1420, Henry's army besieged and took the military fortress castle at Montereau-Fault-Yonne close to Paris. He besieged and captured [[Melun]] in November 1420, returning to England shortly thereafter. In 1428, Charles VII retook Montereau-Fault-Yonne, to once again see the English take it over within a short time. Finally, on 10 October 1437, Charles VII was victorious in regaining Montereau-Fault-Yonne.\n\n=====1421 campaign=====\nWhile he was in England, Henry's brother [[Thomas of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Clarence]], led the English forces in France. On 22 March 1421, Thomas led the English to a disastrous defeat at the [[Battle of Baug\u00e9]] against a Franco-Scottish army. The duke was killed in the battle. On 10 June, Henry sailed back to France to retrieve the situation. It would be his last military campaign. From July to August, Henry's forces besieged and captured [[Dreux]], thus relieving allied forces at [[Chartres]]. On 6 October, his forces [[Siege of Meaux|laid siege]] to [[Meaux]], capturing it on 11 May 1422.\n\n==Death==\nHenry V died suddenly on 31 August 1422, at the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Vincennes]].

BBC]</ref> supposedly contracted during the [[siege of Meaux]]. However, a severe and lethal contraction of dysentery would have probably incapacitated him long before the end of August. Another plausible cause of death is [[heatstroke]]; the last day he was active he had been riding in full armour in blistering heat.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Castor |first1=Helen |title=Joan of Arc |date=2015 |publisher=Faber & Faber |isbn=9780571284634}}</ref>  He was 35 years old and had reigned for nine years.\n\nShortly before his death, Henry V named his brother, [[John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford]], regent of France in the name of his son, [[Henry VI of England]], then only a few months old.

In these early experimental films Obayashi employed a number of [[avant-garde]] techniques that he would carry into his later mainstream work. Though these films tended to be of a personal nature, they received public viewership due to distribution by the [[Art Theatre Guild]].\n\nFollowing his departure from university, Obayashi continued to work on his experimental films. Dentsu, a TV commercial project in Japan looking for new talent, asked members of Film Independents if they would like to direct commercials; Obayashi was the only one from the group to accept the offer, and thus began earning a living as a director in the new field of television advertisements.<ref name=EIGAGOGO>{{cite web|url=http://eigagogo.free.fr/en/interview-nobuhiko-obayashi.php//|title=Interview with Nobuhiko Obayashi|last=Suzuki|first=Namiki|date=January 2010|work=EIGAGOGO|access-date=18 April 2020}}</ref> Obayashi's TV commercials had a visual appeal similar to that of his experimental works.

In these early experimental films Obayashi employed a number of [[avant-garde]] techniques that he would carry into his later mainstream work. Though these films tended to be of a personal nature, they received public viewership due to distribution by the [[Art Theatre Guild]].\n\nFollowing his departure from university, Obayashi continued to work on his experimental films. Dentsu, a TV commercial project in Japan looking for new talent, asked members of Film Independents if they would like to direct commercials; Obayashi was the only one from the group to accept the offer, and thus began earning a living as a director in the new field of television advertisements.<ref name=EIGAGOGO>{{cite web|url=http://eigagogo.free.fr/en/interview-nobuhiko-obayashi.php//|title=INTERVIEW WITH\nNOBUHIKO OBAYASHI|last=Suzuki|first=Namiki|date=January 2010|work=EIGAGOGO|access-date=18 April 2020}}</ref> Obayashi's TV commercials had a visual appeal similar to that of his experimental works.

{"title_page": "Revisionism (Ireland)", "text_new": "'''Revisionism''' in [[Irish historiography]] refers to a [[historical revisionist]] tendency and group of historians who are critical of the orthodox view of [[Irish history]] since the achievement of partial [[Irish Free State|Irish independence]], which comes from the perspective of [[Irish nationalism]]. For opponents, Revisionists are regarded as apologists for the [[British Empire]] in Ireland, proponents of a form of [[denialism]] and even in some cases advocates of [[neo-unionism]], while the Revisionists on the other hand see themselves as positing a progressive cosmopolitan narrative opposed to a \"narrowly [[sectarian]]\" viewpoint.\n\n==History==\nThe revisionist school of Irish history can be said to have originated in the 1930s when it was championed by [[Robert Dudley Edwards]], [[David Beers Quinn|D.

Higgins]] has criticised this calling it \"loose revisionism\" and \"tendentious\". He followed up: \u201cThis was of course a somewhat simplistic and ideological assumption, and contemporary historians are more interested in [[Northern Ireland civil rights movement|the human rights breaches]] and the political and social basis of conflict and exclusion as a source of violence in the Northern Ireland of the 1970s.\u201d<ref>[http://www.president.ie/en/media-library/speeches/speech-at-a-state-ceremonial-event-in-honour-of-patrick-pearse-and-the-iris President Michael D.

He is believed to have made a [[false confession]]. Twenty-three years old at the time of his death and known to be severely mentally disabled, Arridy was executed on January 6, 1939. \n\nMany people at the time and since believed that Arridy was innocent. A book was published about his case in 1995. A group known as Friends of Joe Arridy formed and in 2007 commissioned the first tombstone for his grave. They also supported preparation of a petition by David A. Martinez, Denver attorney, for a state pardon to clear Arridy's name. \n\nIn 2011 Arridy received a full and unconditional posthumous pardon by Colorado Governor [[Bill Ritter]] (72 years after his death). Ritter, the former District Attorney of Denver, pardoned Arridy based on questions about the man's guilt, and what appeared to be a coerced false confession.<ref name=coffman>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pardon-colorado-posthumous/colorado-governor-pardons-man-executed-for-murder-in-1939-idUSTRE70660W20110107|access-date=18 July 2019|last=Coffman| first=Keith|title= Colorado governor pardons man executed for murder in 1939|date=2 January 2011|agency=Reuters}}</ref><ref name=\"miamiherald\">{{cite news|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/01/07/2005435/disabled-man-executed-in-1939.html|title=Disabled man executed in 1939 pardoned in Colorado|last=|first=|date=|work=|publisher=Miami Herald|agency=Associated Press|via=|access-date=8 January 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"Governor pardons Joe Arridy\">{{cite news|url=http://www.chieftain.com/article_2fd30eb6-1aa0-11e0-b0d0-001cc4c002e0.html |title=Governor pardons Joe Arridy |last=Strescino |first=Peter |date=January 7, 2011 |work=Pueblo Chieftain |access-date=9 January 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110110051742/http://www.chieftain.com/article_2fd30eb6-1aa0-11e0-b0d0-001cc4c002e0.html |archivedate=January 10, 2011 }}</ref> This was the first time in Colorado that the governor had pardoned a convict after execution.\n\n==Early life==\nJoe Arridy was born in 1915 in [[Pueblo, Colorado]], to Henry and Mary Arridy, recent immigrants from [[Berosha]], [[Syria]], who were seeking work. They did not know English but Henry had learned that a major steel mill in Pueblo was hiring workers.<ref name=\"Arridy\"/> Arridy was late to start talking as a boy and never spoke in sentences of more than a few words. After he attended one year at elementary school, his principal told his parents to keep him at home, saying that he could not learn. After losing his job a few years later, his father appealed to friends to help him find a place for his son. Arridy was admitted at the age of ten to the State Home and Training School for Mental Defectives in [[Grand Junction, Colorado]], where he lived on and off until becoming a young adult. Both in his neighborhood and at the school, he was often mistreated and beaten by his peers. He left the school and hopped on freight railcars to leave the city, ending up at the age of 21 in the railyards of [[Cheyenne, Wyoming]], by late August 1936.<ref name=\"Begging Joe's pardon\" />\n\n==Attack on two Drain girls==\nAbout August 14, 1936, two girls of the Drain family were attacked while sleeping at home in [[Pueblo, Colorado]]. Both 15-year-old Dorothy and her 12-year-old sister Barbara Drain were bludgeoned by an intruder with what was believed to be a hatchet. Dorothy was also raped; she died from the hatchet attack. Barbara survived.<ref name=\"coffman\"/> \n\n==Arrest and conviction==\nOn August 26, 1936, Arridy was arrested for vagrancy in [[Cheyenne, Wyoming]], after being caught wandering around the railyards. The county sheriff, George Carroll, was aware of the widespread search for suspects in the Drain murder case. When Arridy revealed under questioning that he had traveled through Pueblo by way of a train after leaving [[Grand Junction, Colorado]], Carroll began to question him about the Drain case. Carroll said that Arridy confessed to him.<ref name=\"Sorry, Joe\"/>\n\nWhen Sheriff Carroll contacted the Pueblo police chief Arthur Grady about Arridy, he learned that they had already arrested a man considered to be the prime suspect: Frank Aguilar, a laborer from Mexico. Aguilar had worked for the father of the Drain girls and been fired shortly before the attack. An ax head was recovered from Aguilar's home.<ref name=\"Sorry, Joe\"/> But Sheriff Carroll claimed that Arridy told him several times he had \"been with a man named Frank\" at the crime scene.<ref name=\"Sorry, Joe\">{{cite news|url=http://www.csindy.com/colorado/sorry-joe/Content?oid=1138717|title=Sorry, Joe|date=June 7, 2007|work=Colorado Springs Independent|access-date=8 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710090256/http://www.csindy.com/colorado/sorry-joe/Content?oid=1138717|archive-date=2011-07-10|url-status=live}}</ref> \n\nFrank Aguilar later confessed to the crime and told police he had never seen or met Arridy. Aguilar was also convicted of the rape and murder of Dorothy Drain, and sentenced to death. He was executed in 1937.<ref name=\"coffman\"/><ref name=\"Happiest Man in death cell dies in chair\"/> \n\nAfter being transported to Pueblo, Arridy reportedly confessed again,<ref name=\"Youth confesses attacking girls\">{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=IMgxAAAAIBAJ&sjid=yOIFAAAAIBAJ&pg=2587,5102878&dq=dorothy+drain&hl=en|title=Youth confesses attacking girls|date=August 27, 1936|work=Reading Eagle|access-date=10 January 2011}}</ref> giving several versions of the murder in multiple confessions, with repeated errors of fact. (This often indicates a false confession.) At first he claimed a club was used in the murder. After authorities found an ax or hatchet had been used, Arridy later testified in interviews that he used an axe on the girl. This suggests that officers fed him this information, or provided it by leading questions. \n\nWhen the case was finally brought to trial, Arridy's lawyer tried to gain a plea of insanity to spare his defendant's life. Arridy was ruled to be sane, while acknowledged by three state psychiatrists to be so mentally limited as to be classified as an \"[[imbecile]]\", a medical term of the time. They said he had an [[IQ]] score of 46, and the mind of a six-year-old.<ref name=\"Sorry, Joe\"/> They noted he was \"incapable of distinguishing between right and wrong, and therefore, would be unable to perform any action with a criminal intent.\"<ref name=\"Begging Joe's pardon\">{{cite news|url=http://www.5280.com/magazine/2008/10/crime-begging-joes-pardon|title=Begging Joe's pardon|date=October 2008|publisher=5280|access-date=8 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110207103807/http://www.5280.com/magazine/2008/10/crime-begging-joes-pardon|archive-date=2011-02-07|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"Arridy\">{{cite web| url=http://www.friendsofjoearridy.com/Joe.html| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120731143412/http://friendsofjoearridy.com/Joe.html|archivedate= 2012-07-31  | quote=With the mind of a six-year-old, Joe went to the gas chamber, smiling |title=Arridy |last=Warden|first=Rob |access-date=9 January 2011}}</ref> \n\nArridy was convicted, largely because of his [[false confession]].<ref name=\"Sorry, Joe\"/> Studies since that time have shown that persons of limited mental capacity are more vulnerable to coercion during interrogation and have a higher frequency of making false confessions. There was no physical evidence against him. Barbara Drain, the surviving sister, had testified that Frank Aguilar had been present at the attack, but not Arridy. She could identify Aguilar because he had worked for her father.\n\n==Appeals==\nAttorney [[Gail L. Ireland]], who later was elected and served as Colorado Attorney General and Colorado Water Commissioner, became deeply involved as defense counsel in Arridy's case after his conviction and sentencing. While Ireland won delays of Arridy's execution, he was unable to gain overturning of his conviction or commutation of his sentence. He noted that Aguilar had said he acted alone, and medical experts had testified as to Arridy's mental limitations. Ireland said that Arridy could not even understand what execution meant. \"Believe me when I say that if he is gassed, it will take a long time for the state of Colorado to live down the disgrace,\" Ireland argued to the Colorado state Supreme Court.<ref name=\"Sorry, Joe\"/> Arridy received nine stays of execution as appeals and petitions on his behalf were mounted.<ref name=\"Happiest Man in death cell dies in chair\"/>\n\n==Execution==\nWhile held on [[death row]] during the appeals process, Arridy often played with a toy train,<ref name=\"Moore\">{{cite book |last1=Moore |first1=James |title=Murder by Numbers - Fascinating Figures Behind The World's Worst Crimes |publisher=History Press |location=2018 |isbn=9780750981453 |page=68}}</ref> given to him by prison warden Roy Best. The warden said that Arridy was \"the happiest prisoner on death row.\"<ref name=\"Happiest Man in death cell dies in chair\"/>  He was liked by both the prisoners and guards. Best became one of Arridy's supporters and joined the effort to save his life.<ref name=\"Sorry, Joe\"/> He said of Arridy before his execution: \"He probably didn't even know he was about to die, all he did was happily sit and play with a toy train I had given him.\"<ref name=\"Begging Joe's pardon\" /> \n\nFor his last meal, Arridy requested [[ice cream]].

In addition, the US Supreme Court ruled that it was unconstitutional to apply the death penalty to convicted persons who were mentally disabled. A group of supporters formed the non-profit Friends of Joe Arridy and worked to bring new recognition to the injustice of his case, in addition to commissioning a tombstone for his grave in 2007. \n\nAttorney David A. Martinez became involved and relied on Robert Perske's book about Arridy's case, as well as other materials compiled by the Friends, and his own research, to prepare a 400-page petition for pardon from Governor [[Bill Ritter]], a former district attorney in Denver. Based on the evidence and other reviews, Governor Ritter gave Arridy a full and unconditional pardon in 2011, clearing his name.<ref name=\"coffman\"/><ref name=\"miamiherald\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\n\n*Friends of Joe Arridy is a non-profit group formed by people who became interested in his case and wanted to clear his name.

He is believed to have made a [[false confession]]. Twenty-three years old at the time of his death and known to be severely mentally disabled, Arridy was executed on January 6, 1939. \n\nMany people at the time and since believed that Arridy was innocent. A book was published about his case in 1995. A group known as Friends of Joe Arridy formed and in 2007 commissioned the first tombstone for his grave. They also supported preparation of a petition by David A. Martinez, Denver attorney, for a state pardon to clear Arridy's name. \n\nIn 2011 Arridy received a full and unconditional posthumous pardon by Colorado Governor [[Bill Ritter]] (72 years after his death). Ritter, the former District Attorney of Denver, pardoned Arridy based on questions about the man's guilt, and what appeared to be a coerced false confession.<ref name=coffman>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pardon-colorado-posthumous/colorado-governor-pardons-man-executed-for-murder-in-1939-idUSTRE70660W20110107|access-date=18 July 2019|last=Coffman| first=Keith|title= Colorado governor pardons man executed for murder in 1939|date=2 January 2011|agency=Reuters}}</ref><ref name=\"miamiherald\">{{cite news|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/01/07/2005435/disabled-man-executed-in-1939.html|title=Disabled man executed in 1939 pardoned in Colorado|last=|first=|date=|work=|publisher=Miami Herald|agency=Associated Press|via=|access-date=8 January 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"Governor pardons Joe Arridy\">{{cite news|url=http://www.chieftain.com/article_2fd30eb6-1aa0-11e0-b0d0-001cc4c002e0.html |title=Governor pardons Joe Arridy |last=Strescino |first=Peter |date=January 7, 2011 |work=Pueblo Chieftain |access-date=9 January 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110110051742/http://www.chieftain.com/article_2fd30eb6-1aa0-11e0-b0d0-001cc4c002e0.html |archivedate=January 10, 2011 }}</ref> This was the first time in Colorado that the governor had pardoned a convict after execution.\n\n==Early life==\nJoe Arridy was born in 1915 in [[Pueblo, Colorado]], to Henry and Mary Arridy, recent immigrants from [[Berosha]], [[Syria]], who were seeking work. They did not know English but Henry had learned that a major steel mill in Pueblo was hiring workers.<ref name=\"Arridy\"/> Arridy was late to start talking as a boy and never spoke in sentences of more than a few words. After he attended one year at elementary school, his principal told his parents to keep him at home, saying that he could not learn. After losing his job a few years later, his father appealed to friends to help him find a place for his son. Arridy was admitted at the age of ten to the State Home and Training School for Mental Defectives in [[Grand Junction, Colorado]], where he lived on and off until becoming a young adult. Both in his neighborhood and at the school, he was often mistreated and beaten by his peers. He left the school and hopped on freight railcars to leave the city, ending up at the age of 21 in the railyards of [[Cheyenne, Wyoming]], by late August 1936.<ref name=\"Begging Joe's pardon\" />\n\n==Attack on two Drain girls==\nAbout August 14, 1936, two girls of the Drain family were attacked while sleeping at home in [[Pueblo, Colorado]]. Both 15-year-old Dorothy and her 12-year-old sister Barbara Drain were bludgeoned by an intruder with what was believed to be a hatchet. Dorothy was also raped; she died from the hatchet attack. Barbara survived.<ref name=\"coffman\"/> \n\n==Arrest and conviction==\nOn August 26, 1936, Arridy was arrested for vagrancy in [[Cheyenne, Wyoming]], after being caught wandering around the railyards. The county sheriff, George Carroll, was aware of the widespread search for suspects in the Drain murder case. When Arridy revealed under questioning that he had traveled through Pueblo by way of a train after leaving [[Grand Junction, Colorado]], Carroll began to question him about the Drain case. Carroll said that Arridy confessed to him.<ref name=\"Sorry, Joe\"/>\n\nWhen Sheriff Carroll contacted the Pueblo police chief Arthur Grady about Arridy, he learned that they had already arrested a man considered to be the prime suspect: Frank Aguilar, a laborer from Mexico. Aguilar had worked for the father of the Drain girls and been fired shortly before the attack. An ax head was recovered from Aguilar's home.<ref name=\"Sorry, Joe\"/> But Sheriff Carroll claimed that Arridy told him several times he had \"been with a man named Frank\" at the crime scene.<ref name=\"Sorry, Joe\">{{cite news|url=http://www.csindy.com/colorado/sorry-joe/Content?oid=1138717|title=Sorry, Joe|date=June 7, 2007|work=Colorado Springs Independent|access-date=8 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710090256/http://www.csindy.com/colorado/sorry-joe/Content?oid=1138717|archive-date=2011-07-10|url-status=live}}</ref> \n\nFrank Aguilar later confessed to the crime and told police he had never seen or met Arridy. Aguilar was also convicted of the rape and murder of Dorothy Drain, and sentenced to death. He was executed in 1937.<ref name=\"coffman\"/><ref name=\"Happiest Man in death cell dies in chair\"/> \n\nAfter being transported to Pueblo, Arridy reportedly confessed again,<ref name=\"Youth confesses attacking girls\">{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=IMgxAAAAIBAJ&sjid=yOIFAAAAIBAJ&pg=2587,5102878&dq=dorothy+drain&hl=en|title=Youth confesses attacking girls|date=August 27, 1936|work=Reading Eagle|access-date=10 January 2011}}</ref> giving several versions of the murder in multiple confessions, with repeated errors of fact. (This often indicates a false confession.) At first he claimed a club was used in the murder. After authorities found an ax or hatchet had been used, Arridy later testified in interviews that he used an axe on the girl. This suggests that officers fed him this information, or provided it by leading questions. \n\nWhen the case was finally brought to trial, Arridy's lawyer tried to gain a plea of insanity to spare his defendant's life. Arridy was ruled to be sane, while acknowledged by three state psychiatrists to be so mentally limited as to be classified as an \"[[imbecile]]\", a medical term of the time. They said he had an [[IQ]] score of 46, and the mind of a six-year-old.<ref name=\"Sorry, Joe\"/> They noted he was \"incapable of distinguishing between right and wrong, and therefore, would be unable to perform any action with a criminal intent.\"<ref name=\"Begging Joe's pardon\">{{cite news|url=http://www.5280.com/magazine/2008/10/crime-begging-joes-pardon|title=Begging Joe's pardon|date=October 2008|publisher=5280|access-date=8 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110207103807/http://www.5280.com/magazine/2008/10/crime-begging-joes-pardon|archive-date=2011-02-07|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"Arridy\">{{cite web| url=http://www.friendsofjoearridy.com/Joe.html| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120731143412/http://friendsofjoearridy.com/Joe.html|archivedate= 2012-07-31  | quote=With the mind of a six-year-old, Joe went to the gas chamber, smiling |title=Arridy |last=Warden|first=Rob |access-date=9 January 2011}}</ref> \n\nArridy was convicted, largely because of his [[false confession]].<ref name=\"Sorry, Joe\"/> Studies since that time have shown that persons of limited mental capacity are more vulnerable to coercion during interrogation and have a higher frequency of making false confessions. There was no physical evidence against him. Barbara Drain, the surviving sister, had testified that Frank Aguilar had been present at the attack, but not Arridy. She could identify Aguilar because he had worked for her father.\n\n==Appeals==\nAttorney [[Gail L. Ireland]], who later was elected and served as Colorado Attorney General and Colorado Water Commissioner, became deeply involved as defense counsel in Arridy's case after his conviction and sentencing. While Ireland won delays of Arridy's execution, he was unable to gain overturning of his conviction or commutation of his sentence. He noted that Aguilar had said he acted alone, and medical experts had testified as to Arridy's mental limitations. Ireland said that Arridy could not even understand what execution meant. \"Believe me when I say that if he is gassed, it will take a long time for the state of Colorado to live down the disgrace,\" Ireland argued to the Colorado state Supreme Court.<ref name=\"Sorry, Joe\"/> Arridy received nine stays of execution as appeals and petitions on his behalf were mounted.<ref name=\"Happiest Man in death cell dies in chair\"/>\n\n==Execution==\nWhile held on [[death row]] during the appeals process, Arridy often played with a toy train,<ref name=\"Moore\">{{cite book |last1=Moore |first1=James |title=Murder by Numbers - Fascinating Figures Behind The World's Worst Crimes |publisher=History Press |location=2018 |isbn=9780750981453 |page=68}}</ref> given to him by prison warden Roy Best. The warden said that Arridy was \"the happiest prisoner on death row.\"<ref name=\"Happiest Man in death cell dies in chair\"/>  He was liked by both the prisoners and guards. Best became one of Arridy's supporters and joined the effort to save his life.<ref name=\"Sorry, Joe\"/> He said of Arridy before his execution: \"He probably didn't even know he was about to die, all he did was happily sit and play with a toy train I had given him.\"<ref name=\"Begging Joe's pardon\" /> \n\nFor his last meal, Arridy requested [[ice cream]].

In addition, the US Supreme Court ruled that it was unconstitutional to apply the death penalty to convicted persons who were mentally disabled. A group of supporters formed the non-profit Friends of Joe Arridy and worked to bring new recognition to the injustice of his case, in addition to commissioning a tombstone for his grave in 2007. \n\nAttorney David A. Martinez became involved and relied on Robert Perske's book about Arridy's case, as well as other materials compiled by the Friends, and his own research, to prepare a 400-page petition for pardon from Governor [[Bill Ritter]], a former district attorney in Denver.

In 1872, during the reign of the [[Tongzhi Emperor]], the second Prince Gong peerage, unlike the earlier one, was granted [[Aisin Gioro#Iron-cap princes and their descendants|\"iron-cap\" status]].

people|Manchu]]-led [[Qing dynasty]] (1644\u20131912). It was passed down over two different family lines within the [[Aisin Gioro]] clan.\n\nThe first bearer of the Prince Gong title in the first family line was [[Changning (prince)|Changning]] (1657\u20131703), the fifth son of the [[Shunzhi Emperor]]. He was awarded the title in 1671 by his brother, the [[Kangxi Emperor]]. As the Prince Gong peerage was not awarded [[Aisin Gioro#Iron-cap princes and their descendants|\"iron-cap\" status]], this meant that each successive bearer of the title would normally start off with a title downgraded by one rank ''vis-\u00e0-vis'' that held by his predecessor. However, the title would generally not be downgraded to any lower than a [[Royal and noble ranks of the Qing dynasty#Male members|''feng'en fuguo gong'']] except under special circumstances. It was passed down over ten generations and held by ten persons.\n\nThe first bearer of the Prince Gong title in the second family line was [[Prince Gong|Yixin]] (1833\u20131898), the sixth son of the [[Daoguang Emperor]]. He was awarded the title in 1850 by his father. In 1872, during the reign of the [[Tongzhi Emperor]], the second Prince Gong peerage, unlike the earlier one, was granted [[Aisin Gioro#Iron-cap princes and their descendants|\"iron-cap\" status]].
