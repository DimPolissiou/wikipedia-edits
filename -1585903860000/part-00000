In 1875, he became a [[professor]] at the [[University of Hohenheim|Academy of Agriculture]] at [[Hohenheim]], [[W\u00fcrttemberg]]. He returned to Strasbourg as a professor of physics in 1876, and in 1879, he was appointed to the chair of physics at the [[University of Giessen]]. In 1888, he obtained the physics chair at the [[University of W\u00fcrzburg]], and in 1900 at the [[University of Munich]], by special request of the Bavarian government.\n\nR\u00f6ntgen had family in [[Iowa]] in the United States and planned to emigrate. He accepted an appointment at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City]] and bought transatlantic tickets, before the outbreak of [[World War I]] changed his plans. He remained in Munich for the rest of his career.\n\nDuring 1895, at his laboratory in the W\u00fcrzburg Physical Institute of the University of W\u00fcrzburg, R\u00f6ntgen was investigating the external effects from the various types of vacuum tube equipment \u2013 apparatuses from [[Heinrich Hertz]], [[Johann Hittorf]], [[William Crookes]], [[Nikola Tesla]] and [[Philipp von Lenard]] \u2014 when an [[electrical discharge]] is passed through them.<ref name=Nitske/><ref>{{Cite book\n | last = Agar\n | first = Jon\n | year = 2012\n | title = Science in the Twentieth Century and Beyond\n | publisher = Polity Press\n | location = Cambridge\n | page = 18\n | isbn = 978-0-7456-3469-2\n}}</ref> In early November, he was repeating an experiment with one of Lenard's tubes in which a thin aluminium window had been added to permit the cathode rays to exit the tube but a cardboard covering was added to protect the aluminium from damage by the strong electrostatic field that produces the cathode rays. He knew the cardboard covering prevented light from escaping, yet R\u00f6ntgen observed that the invisible [[cathode rays]] caused a [[fluorescent]] effect on a small cardboard screen painted with [[platinocyanide|barium platinocyanide]] when it was placed close to the [[aluminium]] window. It occurred to R\u00f6ntgen that the [[Crookes\u2013Hittorf tube]], which had a much thicker glass wall than the Lenard tube, might also cause this fluorescent effect.\n\nIn the late afternoon of 8 November 1895, R\u00f6ntgen was determined to test his idea. He carefully constructed a black cardboard covering similar to the one he had used on the Lenard tube. He covered the Crookes\u2013Hittorf tube with the cardboard and attached electrodes to a [[Ruhmkorff coil]] to generate an electrostatic charge. Before setting up the barium platinocyanide screen to test his idea, R\u00f6ntgen darkened the room to test the [[opacity (optics)|opacity]] of his cardboard cover. As he passed the Ruhmkorff coil charge through the tube, he determined that the cover was light-tight and turned to prepare the next step of the experiment. It was at this point that R\u00f6ntgen noticed a faint shimmering from a bench a few feet away from the tube. To be sure, he tried several more discharges and saw the same shimmering each time. Striking a match, he discovered the shimmering had come from the location of the barium platinocyanide screen he had been intending to use next.\n\nR\u00f6ntgen speculated that a new kind of ray might be responsible. 8 November was a Friday, so he took advantage of the weekend to repeat his experiments and made his first notes. In the following weeks, he ate and slept in his laboratory as he investigated many properties of the new rays he temporarily termed \"X-rays\", using the mathematical designation (\"X\") for something unknown. The new rays came to bear his name in many languages as \"R\u00f6ntgen rays\" (and the associated [[Radiography|X-ray radiograms]] as \"R\u00f6ntgenograms\").\n\nAt one point while he was investigating the ability of various materials to stop the rays, R\u00f6ntgen brought a small piece of lead into position while a discharge was occurring. R\u00f6ntgen thus saw the first radiographic image, his own flickering ghostly skeleton on the barium platinocyanide screen. He later reported that it was at this point that he determined to continue his experiments in secrecy, because he feared for his professional reputation if his observations were in error.\n\nAbout six weeks after his discovery, he took a picture \u2013 a ((radiograph)) \u2013 using X-rays of his wife Anna Bertha's hand. When she saw her skeleton she exclaimed \"I have seen my death!\"<ref name=\"Landwehr\">{{cite book|last=Landwehr |first=Gottfried |title=R\u00f6ntgen centennial: X-rays in Natural and Life Sciences|editor=Hasse, A|publisher=World Scientific|location=Singapore|year=1997|pages=7\u20138|isbn=981-02-3085-0}}</ref> He later made a better picture of his friend [[Albert von K\u00f6lliker]]'s hand at a public lecture.\n\nR\u00f6ntgen's original paper, \"On A New Kind of Rays\" (Ueber<!--[sic; see 'Talk:Gottlob Frege#Ueber']--> eine neue Art von Strahlen), was published on 28 December 1895. On 5 January 1896, an Austrian newspaper reported R\u00f6ntgen's discovery of a new type of radiation. R\u00f6ntgen was awarded an honorary [[Doctor of Medicine]] degree from the University of W\u00fcrzburg after his discovery.

In 1875, he became a [[professor]] at the [[University of Hohenheim|Academy of Agriculture]] at [[Hohenheim]], [[W\u00fcrttemberg]]. He returned to Strasbourg as a professor of physics in 1876, and in 1879, he was appointed to the chair of physics at the [[University of Giessen]]. In 1888, he obtained the physics chair at the [[University of W\u00fcrzburg]], and in 1900 at the [[University of Munich]], by special request of the Bavarian government.\n\nR\u00f6ntgen had family in [[Iowa]] in the United States and planned to emigrate. He accepted an appointment at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City]] and bought transatlantic tickets, before the outbreak of [[World War I]] changed his plans. He remained in Munich for the rest of his career.\n\nDuring 1895, at his laboratory in the W\u00fcrzburg Physical Institute of the University of W\u00fcrzburg, R\u00f6ntgen was investigating the external effects from the various types of vacuum tube equipment \u2013 apparatuses from [[Heinrich Hertz]], [[Johann Hittorf]], [[William Crookes]], [[Nikola Tesla]] and [[Philipp von Lenard]] \u2014 when an [[electrical discharge]] is passed through them.<ref name=Nitske/><ref>{{Cite book\n | last = Agar\n | first = Jon\n | year = 2012\n | title = Science in the Twentieth Century and Beyond\n | publisher = Polity Press\n | location = Cambridge\n | page = 18\n | isbn = 978-0-7456-3469-2\n}}</ref> In early November, he was repeating an experiment with one of Lenard's tubes in which a thin aluminium window had been added to permit the cathode rays to exit the tube but a cardboard covering was added to protect the aluminium from damage by the strong electrostatic field that produces the cathode rays. He knew the cardboard covering prevented light from escaping, yet R\u00f6ntgen observed that the invisible [[cathode rays]] caused a [[fluorescent]] effect on a small cardboard screen painted with [[platinocyanide|barium platinocyanide]] when it was placed close to the [[aluminium]] window. It occurred to R\u00f6ntgen that the [[Crookes\u2013Hittorf tube]], which had a much thicker glass wall than the Lenard tube, might also cause this fluorescent effect.\n\nIn the late afternoon of 8 November 1895, R\u00f6ntgen was determined to test his idea. He carefully constructed a black cardboard covering similar to the one he had used on the Lenard tube. He covered the Crookes\u2013Hittorf tube with the cardboard and attached electrodes to a [[Ruhmkorff coil]] to generate an electrostatic charge. Before setting up the barium platinocyanide screen to test his idea, R\u00f6ntgen darkened the room to test the [[opacity (optics)|opacity]] of his cardboard cover. As he passed the Ruhmkorff coil charge through the tube, he determined that the cover was light-tight and turned to prepare the next step of the experiment. It was at this point that R\u00f6ntgen noticed a faint shimmering from a bench a few feet away from the tube. To be sure, he tried several more discharges and saw the same shimmering each time. Striking a match, he discovered the shimmering had come from the location of the barium platinocyanide screen he had been intending to use next.\n\nR\u00f6ntgen speculated that a new kind of ray might be responsible. 8 November was a Friday, so he took advantage of the weekend to repeat his experiments and made his first notes. In the following weeks, he ate and slept in his laboratory as he investigated many properties of the new rays he temporarily termed \"X-rays\", using the mathematical designation (\"X\") for something unknown. The new rays came to bear his name in many languages as \"R\u00f6ntgen rays\" (and the associated [[Radiography|X-ray radiograms]] as \"R\u00f6ntgenograms\").\n\nAt one point while he was investigating the ability of various materials to stop the rays, R\u00f6ntgen brought a small piece of lead into position while a discharge was occurring. R\u00f6ntgen thus saw the first radiographic image, his own flickering ghostly skeleton on the barium platinocyanide screen. He later reported that it was at this point that he determined to continue his experiments in secrecy, because he feared for his professional reputation if his observations were in error.\n\nAbout six weeks after his discovery, he took a picture \u2013 a ((radiograph)) \u2013 using X-rays of his wife Anna Bertha's hand. When she saw her skeleton she exclaimed \"I have seen my death!\"<ref name=\"Landwehr\">{{cite book|last=Landwehr |first=Gottfried |title=R\u00f6ntgen centennial: X-rays in Natural and Life Sciences|editor=Hasse, A|publisher=World Scientific|location=Singapore|year=1997|pages=7\u20138|isbn=981-02-3085-0}}</ref> He later made a better picture of his friend [[Albert von K\u00f6lliker]]'s hand at a public lecture.\n\nR\u00f6ntgen's original paper, \"On A New Kind of Rays\" (Ueber<!--[sic; see 'Talk:Gottlob Frege#Ueber']--> eine neue Art von Strahlen), was published on 28 December 1895.

The airport is managed by PT. Angkasa Pura II, and takes up 528 ha. The airport serves as the main point of entry to West Kalimantan. The airport serves domestic flights to and from several cities and towns in Indonesia and some limited flights to [[Kuching]] and [[Kuala Lumpur]] in the neighboring [[Malaysia]]. The name of the airport is derived from Lieutenant Colonel Supadio, an [[Indonesian Air Force]] officer who served Pangkowilud II Banjarmasin, which oversees the Sungai Durian Airbase (the previous name of the airport). Lieutenant Colonel Supadio died in an airplane crash with Colonel (PNB) Nurtanio in Bandung in 1966. The airport area and runway is also shared with the '''Supadio Airbase''' a Type B airbase of the [[Indonesian Air Force|TNI-AU]] (Indonesian Air Force). It served as the homebase of the Skuadron Udara 1 of the Indonesian Air Force, which consists of a fleet of 18 [[BAE Hawk|Hawk 109/209]].\nThe airport previously suffered from overcapacity. A major renovation,  which involves the building of a larger and more spacious terminal between 2014 and 2017 dramatically increased the airport's capacity. After the renovation, the airport now has four jet bridges and is able to accommodate 3.8&nbsp;million passengers annually. The renovation included the widening and extension of the runway to 2,500-meters, building a new and higher [[Air traffic control]] tower and widening the airport's apron to accommodate more and larger aircraft.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Supadio Airport tower.jpg|thumb|Supadio Airport new [[Air traffic control]] tower]]\n[[File:Supadioairport1.jpg|thumb|Airport terminal interior]]\nThe airport was originally built in the 1940s and was previously named as Sei Durian Airport.\n \nAfter obtaining an agreement with the [[Pontianak Sultanate]], the Pontianak Sultanate decided to give up some land to be used the Dutch colonial government in building a airfield. The Dutch government began to carry out research around the Sei Durian area to decide where to build the airstrip. Finally, the Dutch decided to build the airstrips in Sei Durian due to the consideration of strategic factors of defense. At that time, the Dutch government was involved in [[World War II]] against the [[Empire of Japan]].\n \nUnfortunately, before the construction of the airstrip started, the Dutch colonial administration capitulated to the Japanese Government. During the Japanese occupation, the Japanese military government decided to proceed building the airstrip, considering its strategic importance. The Japanese stationed several of its military airplanes in Sei Durian over the course of the war. After the Japanese surrendered in 1945, the airstrip was briefly retaken by the Dutch colonial government, before finally taken over by the new Indonesian government. Over the course of the year, the Indonesian government developed the airport, resulting in its present state.\n\nAt the height of the [[Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation]], several aircraft of the [[Indonesian Air Force]] were stationed on Sei Durian Airport, owing to its proximity with Malaysia in subsequent developments, the history of the Sungai Durian Airbase has undergone many series of change processes, ranging from changes in status or air force base type or renaming changes. After hostility ceased, the airbase was upgraded from a Type C Airbase to a Type B Airbase. Currently, Supadio Airport houses the Skuadron Udara 1 of the [[Indonesian Air Force]], composing of a fleet of [[BAE Hawk|Hawk 109/209]].\n\nIn the 1980s, the airport was renamed Supadio Airport. In the 1970s, the first international flight to [[Kuching]] in neighbouring [[Sarawak]] started, operated by [[Merpati Nusantara Airlines]]. In the 1980s, flights to Singapore started, operated by [[Garuda Indonesia]]. In late-October 1989, [[Malaysia Airlines]] also started flight to [[Pontianak]] from [[Kuching]]. All of these international flights discontinued in 1998 due to the Asian Financial Crisis but the routes to Kuching however has been resumed in mid-1999, operated by 3 different airlines consecutively namely Batavia Air, Kalstar and Xpress Air which suspended services shortly after Wings Air operated the route. Together with Airasia, both airlines operate 14 weekly flights between Pontianak and Kuching. Between early to mid 2010s, there were also short-lived flights to [[Singapore]] (operated by Batavia Air) and [[Johor Bahru]] (by Xpress Air). Flight to [[Kuala Lumpur]] also commenced in late-March 2015, operated by [[AirAsia]].\n\n==Airlines and destinations==\n\n===Passenger===\n{{Airport-dest-list\n| [[AirAsia]] | [[Kuala Lumpur

The airport is managed by PT. Angkasa Pura II, and takes up 528 ha. The airport serves as the main point of entry to West Kalimantan. The airport serves domestic flights to and from several cities and towns in Indonesia and some limited flights to [[Kuching]] and [[Kuala Lumpur]] in the neighboring [[Malaysia]]. The name of the airport is derived from Lieutenant Colonel Supadio, an [[Indonesian Air Force]] officer who served Pangkowilud II Banjarmasin, which oversees the Sungai Durian Airbase (the previous name of the airport). Lieutenant Colonel Supadio died in an airplane crash with Colonel (PNB) Nurtanio in Bandung in 1966. The airport area and runway is also shared with the '''Supadio Airbase''' a Type B airbase of the [[Indonesian Air Force|TNI-AU]] (Indonesian Air Force). It served as the homebase of the Skuadron Udara 1 of the Indonesian Air Force, which consists of a fleet of 18 [[BAE Hawk|Hawk 109/209]].\nThe airport previously suffered from overcapacity. A major renovation,  which involves the building of a larger and more spacious terminal between 2014 and 2017 dramatically increased the airport's capacity. After the renovation, the airport now has four jet bridges and is able to accommodate 3.8&nbsp;million passengers annually. The renovation included the widening and extension of the runway to 2,500-meters, building a new and higher [[Air traffic control]] tower and widening the airport's apron to accommodate more and larger aircraft.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Supadio Airport tower.jpg|thumb|Supadio Airport new [[Air traffic control]] tower]]\n[[File:Supadioairport1.jpg|thumb|Airport terminal interior]]\nThe airport was originally built in the 1940s and was previously named as Sei Durian Airport.\n \nAfter obtaining an agreement with the [[Pontianak Sultanate]], the Pontianak Sultanate decided to give up some land to be used the Dutch colonial government in building a airfield. The Dutch government began to carry out research around the Sei Durian area to decide where to build the airstrip. Finally, the Dutch decided to build the airstrips in Sei Durian due to the consideration of strategic factors of defense. At that time, the Dutch government was involved in [[World War II]] against the [[Empire of Japan]].\n \nUnfortunately, before the construction of the airstrip started, the Dutch colonial administration capitulated to the Japanese Government. During the Japanese occupation, the Japanese military government decided to proceed building the airstrip, considering its strategic importance. The Japanese stationed several of its military airplanes in Sei Durian over the course of the war. After the Japanese surrendered in 1945, the airstrip was briefly retaken by the Dutch colonial government, before finally taken over by the new Indonesian government. Over the course of the year, the Indonesian government developed the airport, resulting in its present state.\n\nAt the height of the [[Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation]], several aircraft of the [[Indonesian Air Force]] were stationed on Sei Durian Airport, owing to its proximity with Malaysia in subsequent developments, the history of the Sungai Durian Airbase has undergone many series of change processes, ranging from changes in status or air force base type or renaming changes. After hostility ceased, the airbase was upgraded from a Type C Airbase to a Type B Airbase. Currently, Supadio Airport houses the Skuadron Udara 1 of the [[Indonesian Air Force]], composing of a fleet of [[BAE Hawk|Hawk 109/209]].\n\nIn the 1980s, the airport was renamed Supadio Airport. In the 1970s, the first international flight to [[Kuching]] in neighbouring [[Sarawak]] started, operated by [[Merpati Nusantara Airlines]]. In the 1980s, flights to Singapore started, operated by [[Garuda Indonesia]]. In late-October 1989, [[Malaysia Airlines]] also started flight to [[Pontianak]] from [[Kuching]]. All of these international flights discontinued in 1998 due to the Asian Financial Crisis but the routes to Kuching however has been resumed in mid-1999, operated by 3 different airlines consecutively namely Batavia Air, Kalstar and Xpress Air which suspended services shortly after Wings Air operated the route. Together with Airasia, both airlines operate 14 weekly flights between Pontianak and Kuching. Between early to mid 2010s, there were also short-lived flights to [[Singapore]] (operated by Batavia Air) and [[Johor Bahru]] (by Xpress Air). Flight to [[Kuala Lumpur]] also commenced in late-March 2015, operated by [[AirAsia]].\n\n==Airlines and destinations==\n\n===Passenger===\n{{Airport-dest-list\n| [[AirAsia]] | [[Kuala Lumpur
