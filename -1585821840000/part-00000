{"title_page": "Primer (firearms)", "text_new": "In [[firearm]]s and [[artillery]], the '''primer''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|p|r|a\u026a|m|\u0259r}}) is the chemical and/or device responsible for initiating the [[propellant]] [[combustion]] that will push the [[projectile]]s out of the [[gun barrel]].\n\nIn early, [[black powder]] guns such as [[muzzleloader]]s, the primer was essentially the same chemical as the main propellant (albeit usually in a finer-powdered form), but poured into an external [[flash pan]], where it could be ignited by an ignition source such as a [[slow match]] or a [[flintlock]]. This external powder was connected through a small opening at the rear of the gun barrel that led to the main charge within the barrel. As gunpowder will not burn when wet, this made it difficult (or even impossible) to fire these types of weapons in rainy or humid conditions.\n\nModern primers, by contrast, are more specialized and distinct from the main propellant they are designed to ignite.  They are of two types, those using [[shock sensitivity|shock-sensitive]] chemicals, and those reliant on chemicals ignited by an electric impulse. In [[small arms|smaller weapons]] the primer is usually of the first type and integrated into the base of a cartridge. Examples include [[handgun]] [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridges]], [[rifle]] [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]]s and [[shotgun]] [[Shotgun shell|shell]]s.  Larger [[artillery piece]]s in contrast typically use electric priming.  In artillery the primers are frequently a separate component, placed inside the barrel to the rear of the main propellant charge\u2014but there are other examples of guns, including for example some automatic weapons, designed to shoot cartridges with integral electric primers.\n\nUpon being struck with sufficient force generated by the [[firing pin]], or electrically ignited, primers react chemically to produce heat, which gets transferred to the main propellant charge and ignites it, and this, in turn, propels the projectile. Due to their small size, these primers themselves lack the power to shoot the projectile, but still have enough energy to drive a bullet partway into the barrel \u2014 a dangerous condition called a [[squib load]].\n\n==Priming methods==\nThe first step to firing a firearm of any sort is igniting the propellant. The earliest firearms were [[hand cannon]]s, which were simple closed tubes. There was a small aperture, the \"touchhole\", drilled in the closed end of the tube, leading to the main [[gun powder|powder]] charge. This hole was filled with finely ground powder, which was then ignited with a hot [[ember]] or [[torch]]. With the advent of hand-held firearms, this became an undesirable way of firing a gun. Holding a burning stick while trying to pour a charge of black powder carefully down a barrel is dangerous, and trying to hold the gun with one hand while simultaneously aiming at the target and looking for the touchhole makes it very difficult to fire accurately.\n\n==External priming==\n===Matchlock===\n{{Main|Matchlock}}\nThe first attempt to make the process of firing a small arm easier was the \"matchlock\". The matchlock incorporated a \"lock\" (so-called because of its resemblance to door locks of the day) that was actuated by a [[trigger (firearms)|trigger]], originally called a \"tricker.\"  The lock was a simple lever which pivoted when pulled and lowered the [[Match#History of the term match|match]] down to the touchhole. The match was a slow-burning [[Fuse (explosives)|fuse]] made of plant fibers that were soaked in a solution of [[nitrates]], [[charcoal]], and [[sulfur]], and dried. This \"slow-match\" was ignited before the [[gun]] was needed, and it would slowly burn, keeping a hot ember at the burning end. After the gun was loaded and the touchhole primed with powder, the burning tip of the match was positioned so that the lock would bring it into contact with the touchhole. To fire the gun, it was aimed and the trigger pulled. This brought the match down to the touchhole, igniting the powder. With careful attention, the slow-burning match could be kept burning for long periods of time, and the use of the lock mechanism made fairly accurate fire possible.\n\n===Wheel-lock===\n{{Main|Wheellock}}\nThe next revolution in ignition technology was the \"wheel-lock\". It used a spring-loaded, [[serration|serrated]] [[steel]] [[wheel]] which rubbed against a piece of [[iron pyrite]], similar to a modern [[lighter]]. A key was used to wind the wheel and put the spring under tension. Once tensioned, the wheel was held in place by a trigger. When the trigger was pulled, the serrated edge of the steel rubbed against the pyrite, generating [[Ember|sparks]]. These sparks were directed into a pan, called the \"[[flash pan]]\", filled with loose powder which led into the touchhole. The flashpan usually was protected by a spring-loaded cover that would slide out of the way when the trigger was pulled, exposing the powder to the sparks. The wheel-lock was a major [[innovation]] &mdash; since it did not rely on burning material as a source of [[heat]], it could be kept ready for extended periods of time. The covered flashpan also provided some ability to withstand bad weather. Wind, rain, and wet weather would render a matchlock useless, but a wheel-lock that was loaded and waterproofed with a bit of [[grease (lubricant)|grease]] around the flashpan could be fired under most conditions.\n\n===Flintlock===\n{{Main|Flintlock}}\nThe wheel-lock enjoyed only a brief period of popularity before being superseded by a simpler, more robust design. The \"flintlock\", like the wheel-lock, used a flashpan and a spark to ignite the powder. As the name implies, the flintlock used [[flint]] rather than iron pyrite. The flint was held in a spring-loaded arm, called the \"cock\" from the resemblance of its motion to a pecking chicken. The cock rotated through approximately a 90-degree arc and was held in the tensioned, or \"cocked\" position by a trigger. Usually, flintlocks could lock the cock in two positions. The \"half-cock\" position held the cock halfway back, and used a deep notch so that pulling the trigger would not release the cock. Half-cock was a safety position, used when loading, storing or carrying a loaded flintlock. The \"full-cock\" position held the cock all the way back and was the position from which the gun was fired. The L-shaped \"frizzen\" was the other half of the flintlock's ignition system. It served as both a flashpan cover and a steel striking surface for the flint. The frizzen was hinged and spring-loaded so that it would lock in the open or closed position. When closed, the striking surface was positioned so that the flint would strike at the proper angle to generate a spark. The striking flint would also open the [[frizzen]], exposing the flashpan to the spark. The flintlock mechanism was simpler and stronger than the wheel-lock, and the flint and steel provided a good, reliable source of ignition. The flintlock remained in military service for over 200 years, and flintlocks are still made today for historical re-enactments and muzzle-loading target competition, and for hunters who enjoy the additional challenge that the flintlock provides.\n\n===Caplock===\n{{Main|Percussion cap}}\n[[File:Percussion caps.jpg|thumb|right|Percussion caps]]\nThe next major leap in ignition technology was the invention of the chemical primer, or \"cap\", and the mechanism which used it, called the \"caplock\". Percussion ignition was invented by Scottish clergyman [[Reverend|Rev.]] [[Alexander John Forsyth]] in 1807 but needed further refinements before it was gradually accepted in the 1820s to 1830s. By the middle of the 19th century, the percussion or caplock system was well established. It was adopted by both sides in the [[American Civil War]], as it was simpler and more reliable than the flintlock. The main reason the caplock was so quickly adopted was its similarity to the flintlock and the ease of converting older arms to use percussion-cap ignition; usually, the same lock and barrel could be used with minor changes. The flashpan and frizzen were removed and replaced by a small, hollow horizontal cylinder (drum) screwed into the bored-out and tapped flash hole and carrying a \"nipple\" over which the cap could be fitted. A \"hammer\" which also had half-cock (for loading and applying the cap) and full-cock positions replaced the cock. When released by pulling the trigger, the hammer would strike the cap, crushing it against the nipple. The [[percussion cap]] was a thin metal cup that contained a small quantity of pressure-sensitive explosive, often [[Mercury(II) fulminate|mercury fulminate]]. When crushed, the explosive would detonate, sending a stream of hot [[gas]] down through a hole in the nipple and into the touchhole of the gun to ignite the powder charge. In the process of firing, the cap generally split open and would fall off when the hammer was moved to the half-cock position for loading. The caplock system worked well, and is still the preferred method of ignition for [[hunter]]s and recreational shooters who use [[Muzzleloader|muzzle-loading]] arms.\n\n=== Electric-fired ===\nA small number of [[Caseless ammunition|caseless]] cartridges use no primer at all, but the primary propellant is ignited using an externally provided electric charge, such as with the [[Voere VEC-91]] and the O'Dwyer VLe. This is not to be confused with an electrically ignited internal primer (see below).\n\n==Internal priming==<!-- This section is linked from [[Tubes and primers for ammunition]] -->\n[[File:Fired rimfire and centerfire casings.jpg|thumb|left|Fired rimfire and centerfire casings]]\nChemical primers, advanced [[metallurgy]] and [[manufacturing]] techniques all came together in the 19th century to create an entirely new class of firearm&nbsp;&mdash; the cartridge arm. Flintlock and caplock shooters had long carried their [[ammunition]] in [[paper cartridge]]s, which served to hold a measured charge of powder and a [[bullet]] in one convenient package; the paper also served to seal the bullet in the bore. Still, the source of ignition was handled separately from the cartridge. With the advent of chemical primers, it was not long before several systems were invented with many different ways of combining bullet, powder, and primer into a single package which could be loaded quickly from the [[breech-loading weapon|breech]] of the firearm. This greatly streamlined the reloading procedure and paved the way for semi- and fully automatic firearms.\n\nThis big leap forward came at a price. It introduced an extra component into each round \u2013 the cartridge case - which had to be removed before the gun could be reloaded. While a flintlock, for example, is immediately ready to be reloaded once it has been fired, adopting brass cartridge cases brought in the problems of extraction and ejection. The mechanism of a modern gun not only must load and fire the piece, but also must remove the spent case, which may require just as many moving parts. Many [[Firearm malfunction|malfunctions]] involve this process, either through failure to extract a case properly from the chamber or by allowing it to jam the action. Nineteenth-century inventors were reluctant to accept this added complication and experimented with a variety of [[paper cartridge|self-consuming cartridges]] before acknowledging that the advantages of brass cases far outweighed their one drawback.\n\nThe three systems of self-contained metallic cartridge ignition which have survived the test of time are the [[rimfire ammunition|rimfire]], the Berdan [[centerfire]] primer, and the Boxer centerfire primer.\n\n===Pinfire===\n{{Main|Pinfire}}\nA pinfire firearm cartridge is an obsolete type of brass cartridge in which the priming compound is ignited by striking a small pin which protrudes radially from just above the base of the cartridge. Invented by Casimir Lefaucheux in 1828 but not patented until 1835, it was one of the earliest practical designs of metallic cartridge. However, the protruding pin was vulnerable to damage, displacement and accidental ignition. Moreover, the pin had to be positioned carefully in a small notch when loading, making the pinfire's use in repeating or self-loading weapons impossible. The pinfire survives today only in a few very small blank cartridges designed as noisemakers and in novelty miniature guns.\n\n===Rimfire===\n{{Main|Rimfire ammunition}}\nRimfire cartridges use a thin [[brass]] case with a hollow bulge, or rim, around the back end. This rim is filled during manufacture with an impact-sensitive primer. In the wet state, the primer is stable; a pellet of wet primer is placed in the shell and simply spun out to the full extremes of the rim. (For more on the exact process and one set of chemical compounds that have been used successfully, see {{US patent|1880235}}, a 1932 Remington Arms patent by James E. Burns.)  In the dry state, the primer within the rim becomes impact-sensitive. When the rim is then crushed by the hammer or firing pin, the primer detonates and ignites the powder charge. Rimfire cartridges are single-use and normally cannot be reloaded. Also, since the rim must be thin enough to be easily crushed, the peak pressure possible in the case is limited by the strength of this thin rim. Rimfire cartridges originally were available in [[caliber]]s up to 1\" (100 caliber), however, all but the small .22 caliber rounds eventually died out. The [[.22 Long Rifle]], also fired in [[pistol]]s, is the most popular recreational caliber today because it is inexpensive, quiet, and has very low [[recoil]].\n\nWhile the rimfire priming method is limited due to the thin cases required, it has enjoyed a few resurgences recently. First was Winchester's .22 Magnum Rimfire, or [[.22 WMR]], in the 1950s, followed in 1970 by Remington's short-lived [[5 mm Remington Rimfire Magnum|5mm Rimfire]], based on Winchester's magnum case. In 2002 [[Hornady]] introduced a new .17 caliber cartridge based on the .22 WMR, the [[.17 HMR]]. The .17 HMR is essentially a .22 WMR cartridge necked down to accept a .17-caliber bullet and is used as a flat-shooting, light-duty [[varmint]] round. The .17 HMR was followed a year later by Hornady's .17 Mach 2, or [[.17 HM2]], which is based on a slightly lengthened and necked-down .22 Long Rifle cartridge. Both of the .17 caliber rimfires have had widespread support from firearms makers, and while the high-tech, high-velocity .17 caliber jacketed bullets make the [[.17 Rimfire]] cartridges quite a bit more expensive than the .22 caliber versions, they are excellent for shorter-range shooting and still far less expensive than comparable centerfire cartridges. In 2013, Winchester released the [[.17 Winchester Super Magnum]], which utilizes the larger case of the long-obsolete [[.25 Stevens]] allowing for velocities approaching 3000fps with a 20gr bullet and making it the world's fastest rimfire round.<ref>[http://www.outdoorlife.com/blogs/gun-shots/2013/01/worlds-fastest-rimfire John B.

The primer in turn ignites the main propellant, just as with a shock-sensitive or external electric type.  Among the advantages this brings is the ability, in an automatic weapon, to control the moment of cartridge ignition partially independently of the mechanical action of the gun.  Historically this flexibility was employed by the German Luftwaffe in WW II, in the unusually efficient [[synchronization gear]] that enabled machine guns and autocannon to be fired through the moving propellors of their fighter aircraft with a relatively small compromise in the guns' output of automatic fire.  This system was also used in the Etronic system developed and sold by Remington for some of its sporting rifles. It was sold as a firearm with a much faster lock time. It never became a popular sporting arms system and was discontinued by Remington as a result. Other countries such as the Soviet Union relied on cruder mechanical systems, which reduced the rate of fire of their guns more severely.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.quarryhs.co.uk/WW2guneffect.htm|title=WORLD WAR 2 FIGHTER GUN EFFECTIVENESS|author=|date=|website=www.quarryhs.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Lead(II) azide]]\n*[[Lead styphnate]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Citation |last=Siekman |first=Mark W. |last2=Anderson |first2=David A. |last3=Boyce |first3=Allan S. |title=Small-Arms Ammunition Production and Acquisition: Too Many Eggs in One Basket? |journal=Professional Bulletin of United States Army Sustainment |volume=42 |issue=5 |date=September\u2013October 2010|id=PB 700-10-05 |publisher=U.S. Army |url=http://www.almc.army.mil/alog/issues/SepOct10/spectrum_smallarms_ammo.html |doi= |ref=none}}.

In 1630, Van Drebbel ([[Cornelis Drebbel]]?) investigated fulminate of mercury and \"explosive gold\". In 1690, [[Johann von L\u00f6wenstern-Kunckel]]'s book ''Laboratorium Chymicum'' described how to make fulminate of mercury. In 1805, [[Alexander John Forsyth]] used potassium chlorate to make pellets, but these were not safe. \"The first ignition caps were invented in the early nineteenth century. In these caps the ignitable composition was enclosed in a casing of brass or copper. This invention cannot be traced with any certainty to any individual. The literature on the subject names several chemists including Bellot and Egg in 1815 [5]. The first application of mercury fulminate in ignition caps is attributed to Wright[6] in 1823.\"\n\n[[Category:Ammunition]]\n", "text_old": "In [[firearm]]s and [[artillery]], the '''primer''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|p|r|a\u026a|m|\u0259r}}) is the chemical and/or device responsible for initiating the [[propellant]] [[combustion]] that will push the [[projectile]]s out of the [[gun barrel]].   \n\nIn early, [[black powder]] guns such as [[muzzleloader]]s, the primer was essentially the same chemical as the main propellant (albeit usually in a finer-powdered form), but poured into an external [[flash pan]], where it could be ignited by an ignition source such as a [[slow match]] or a [[flintlock]]. This external powder was connected through a small opening at the rear of the gun barrel that led to the main charge within the barrel. As gunpowder will not burn when wet, this made it difficult (or even impossible) to fire these types of weapons in rainy or humid conditions.\n\nModern primers, by contrast, are more specialized and distinct from the main propellant they are designed to ignite.  They are of two types, those using [[shock sensitivity|shock-sensitive]] chemicals, and those reliant on chemicals ignited by an electric impulse. In [[small arms|smaller weapons]] the primer is usually of the first type and integrated into the base of a cartridge. Examples include [[handgun]] [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridges]], [[rifle]] [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]]s and [[shotgun]] [[Shotgun shell|shell]]s.  Larger [[artillery piece]]s in contrast typically use electric priming.  In artillery the primers are frequently a separate component, placed inside the barrel to the rear of the main propellant charge -- but there are other examples of guns, including for example some automatic weapons, designed to shoot cartridges with integral electric primers. \n\nUpon being struck with sufficient force generated by the [[firing pin]], or electrically ignited, primers react chemically to produce heat, which gets transferred to the main propellant charge and ignites it, and this, in turn, propels the projectile. Due to their small size, these primers themselves lack the power to shoot the projectile, but still have enough energy to drive a bullet partway into the barrel \u2014 a dangerous condition called a [[squib load]].\n\n==Priming methods==\nThe first step to firing a firearm of any sort is igniting the propellant. The earliest firearms were [[hand cannon]]s, which were simple closed tubes. There was a small aperture, the \"touchhole\", drilled in the closed end of the tube, leading to the main [[gun powder|powder]] charge. This hole was filled with finely ground powder, which was then ignited with a hot [[ember]] or [[torch]]. With the advent of hand-held firearms, this became an undesirable way of firing a gun. Holding a burning stick while trying to pour a charge of black powder carefully down a barrel is dangerous, and trying to hold the gun with one hand while simultaneously aiming at the target and looking for the touchhole makes it very difficult to fire accurately.\n\n==External priming==\n===Matchlock===\n{{Main|Matchlock}}\nThe first attempt to make the process of firing a small arm easier was the \"matchlock\". The matchlock incorporated a \"lock\" (so-called because of its resemblance to door locks of the day) that was actuated by a [[trigger (firearms)|trigger]], originally called a \"tricker.\"  The lock was a simple lever which pivoted when pulled and lowered the [[Match#History of the term match|match]] down to the touchhole. The match was a slow-burning [[Fuse (explosives)|fuse]] made of plant fibers that were soaked in a solution of [[nitrates]], [[charcoal]], and [[sulfur]], and dried. This \"slow-match\" was ignited before the [[gun]] was needed, and it would slowly burn, keeping a hot ember at the burning end. After the gun was loaded and the touchhole primed with powder, the burning tip of the match was positioned so that the lock would bring it into contact with the touchhole. To fire the gun, it was aimed and the trigger pulled. This brought the match down to the touchhole, igniting the powder. With careful attention, the slow-burning match could be kept burning for long periods of time, and the use of the lock mechanism made fairly accurate fire possible.\n\n===Wheel-lock===\n{{Main|Wheellock}}\nThe next revolution in ignition technology was the \"wheel-lock\". It used a spring-loaded, [[serration|serrated]] [[steel]] [[wheel]] which rubbed against a piece of [[iron pyrite]], similar to a modern [[lighter]]. A key was used to wind the wheel and put the spring under tension. Once tensioned, the wheel was held in place by a trigger. When the trigger was pulled, the serrated edge of the steel rubbed against the pyrite, generating [[Ember|sparks]]. These sparks were directed into a pan, called the \"[[flash pan]]\", filled with loose powder which led into the touchhole. The flashpan usually was protected by a spring-loaded cover that would slide out of the way when the trigger was pulled, exposing the powder to the sparks. The wheel-lock was a major [[innovation]] &mdash; since it did not rely on burning material as a source of [[heat]], it could be kept ready for extended periods of time. The covered flashpan also provided some ability to withstand bad weather. Wind, rain, and wet weather would render a matchlock useless, but a wheel-lock that was loaded and waterproofed with a bit of [[grease (lubricant)|grease]] around the flashpan could be fired under most conditions.\n\n===Flintlock===\n{{Main|Flintlock}}\nThe wheel-lock enjoyed only a brief period of popularity before being superseded by a simpler, more robust design. The \"flintlock\", like the wheel-lock, used a flashpan and a spark to ignite the powder. As the name implies, the flintlock used [[flint]] rather than iron pyrite. The flint was held in a spring-loaded arm, called the \"cock\" from the resemblance of its motion to a pecking chicken. The cock rotated through approximately a 90-degree arc and was held in the tensioned, or \"cocked\" position by a trigger. Usually, flintlocks could lock the cock in two positions. The \"half-cock\" position held the cock halfway back, and used a deep notch so that pulling the trigger would not release the cock. Half-cock was a safety position, used when loading, storing or carrying a loaded flintlock. The \"full-cock\" position held the cock all the way back and was the position from which the gun was fired. The L-shaped \"frizzen\" was the other half of the flintlock's ignition system. It served as both a flashpan cover and a steel striking surface for the flint. The frizzen was hinged and spring-loaded so that it would lock in the open or closed position. When closed, the striking surface was positioned so that the flint would strike at the proper angle to generate a spark. The striking flint would also open the [[frizzen]], exposing the flashpan to the spark. The flintlock mechanism was simpler and stronger than the wheel-lock, and the flint and steel provided a good, reliable source of ignition. The flintlock remained in military service for over 200 years, and flintlocks are still made today for historical re-enactments and muzzle-loading target competition, and for hunters who enjoy the additional challenge that the flintlock provides.\n\n===Caplock===\n{{Main|Percussion cap}}\n[[File:Percussion caps.jpg|thumb|right|Percussion caps]]\nThe next major leap in ignition technology was the invention of the chemical primer, or \"cap\", and the mechanism which used it, called the \"caplock\". Percussion ignition was invented by Scottish clergyman [[Reverend|Rev.]] [[Alexander John Forsyth]] in 1807 but needed further refinements before it was gradually accepted in the 1820s to 1830s. By the middle of the 19th century, the percussion or caplock system was well established. It was adopted by both sides in the [[American Civil War]], as it was simpler and more reliable than the flintlock. The main reason the caplock was so quickly adopted was its similarity to the flintlock and the ease of converting older arms to use percussion-cap ignition; usually, the same lock and barrel could be used with minor changes. The flashpan and frizzen were removed and replaced by a small, hollow horizontal cylinder (drum) screwed into the bored-out and tapped flash hole and carrying a \"nipple\" over which the cap could be fitted. A \"hammer\" which also had half-cock (for loading and applying the cap) and full-cock positions replaced the cock. When released by pulling the trigger, the hammer would strike the cap, crushing it against the nipple. The [[percussion cap]] was a thin metal cup that contained a small quantity of pressure-sensitive explosive, often [[Mercury(II) fulminate|mercury fulminate]]. When crushed, the explosive would detonate, sending a stream of hot [[gas]] down through a hole in the nipple and into the touchhole of the gun to ignite the powder charge. In the process of firing, the cap generally split open and would fall off when the hammer was moved to the half-cock position for loading. The caplock system worked well, and is still the preferred method of ignition for [[hunter]]s and recreational shooters who use [[Muzzleloader|muzzle-loading]] arms.\n\n=== Electric-fired ===\nA small number of [[Caseless ammunition|caseless]] cartridges use no primer at all, but the primary propellant is ignited using an externally provided electric charge, such as with the [[Voere VEC-91]] and the O'Dwyer VLe. This is not to be confused with an electrically ignited internal primer (see below).\n\n==Internal priming==<!-- This section is linked from [[Tubes and primers for ammunition]] -->\n[[File:Fired rimfire and centerfire casings.jpg|thumb|left|Fired rimfire and centerfire casings]]\nChemical primers, advanced [[metallurgy]] and [[manufacturing]] techniques all came together in the 19th century to create an entirely new class of firearm&nbsp;&mdash; the cartridge arm. Flintlock and caplock shooters had long carried their [[ammunition]] in [[paper cartridge]]s, which served to hold a measured charge of powder and a [[bullet]] in one convenient package; the paper also served to seal the bullet in the bore. Still, the source of ignition was handled separately from the cartridge. With the advent of chemical primers, it was not long before several systems were invented with many different ways of combining bullet, powder, and primer into a single package which could be loaded quickly from the [[breech-loading weapon|breech]] of the firearm. This greatly streamlined the reloading procedure and paved the way for semi- and fully automatic firearms.\n\nThis big leap forward came at a price. It introduced an extra component into each round \u2013 the cartridge case - which had to be removed before the gun could be reloaded. While a flintlock, for example, is immediately ready to be reloaded once it has been fired, adopting brass cartridge cases brought in the problems of extraction and ejection. The mechanism of a modern gun not only must load and fire the piece, but also must remove the spent case, which may require just as many moving parts. Many [[Firearm malfunction|malfunctions]] involve this process, either through failure to extract a case properly from the chamber or by allowing it to jam the action. Nineteenth-century inventors were reluctant to accept this added complication and experimented with a variety of [[paper cartridge|self-consuming cartridges]] before acknowledging that the advantages of brass cases far outweighed their one drawback.\n\nThe three systems of self-contained metallic cartridge ignition which have survived the test of time are the [[rimfire ammunition|rimfire]], the Berdan [[centerfire]] primer, and the Boxer centerfire primer.\n\n===Pinfire===\n{{Main|Pinfire}}\nA pinfire firearm cartridge is an obsolete type of brass cartridge in which the priming compound is ignited by striking a small pin which protrudes radially from just above the base of the cartridge. Invented by Casimir Lefaucheux in 1828 but not patented until 1835, it was one of the earliest practical designs of metallic cartridge. However, the protruding pin was vulnerable to damage, displacement and accidental ignition. Moreover, the pin had to be positioned carefully in a small notch when loading, making the pinfire's use in repeating or self-loading weapons impossible. The pinfire survives today only in a few very small blank cartridges designed as noisemakers and in novelty miniature guns.\n\n===Rimfire===\n{{Main|Rimfire ammunition}}\nRimfire cartridges use a thin [[brass]] case with a hollow bulge, or rim, around the back end. This rim is filled during manufacture with an impact-sensitive primer. In the wet state, the primer is stable; a pellet of wet primer is placed in the shell and simply spun out to the full extremes of the rim. (For more on the exact process and one set of chemical compounds that have been used successfully, see {{US patent|1880235}}, a 1932 Remington Arms patent by James E. Burns.)  In the dry state, the primer within the rim becomes impact-sensitive. When the rim is then crushed by the hammer or firing pin, the primer detonates and ignites the powder charge. Rimfire cartridges are single-use and normally cannot be reloaded. Also, since the rim must be thin enough to be easily crushed, the peak pressure possible in the case is limited by the strength of this thin rim. Rimfire cartridges originally were available in [[caliber]]s up to 1\" (100 caliber), however, all but the small .22 caliber rounds eventually died out. The [[.22 Long Rifle]], also fired in [[pistol]]s, is the most popular recreational caliber today because it is inexpensive, quiet, and has very low [[recoil]].\n\nWhile the rimfire priming method is limited due to the thin cases required, it has enjoyed a few resurgences recently. First was Winchester's .22 Magnum Rimfire, or [[.22 WMR]], in the 1950s, followed in 1970 by Remington's short-lived [[5 mm Remington Rimfire Magnum|5mm Rimfire]], based on Winchester's magnum case. In 2002 [[Hornady]] introduced a new .17 caliber cartridge based on the .22 WMR, the [[.17 HMR]]. The .17 HMR is essentially a .22 WMR cartridge necked down to accept a .17-caliber bullet and is used as a flat-shooting, light-duty [[varmint]] round. The .17 HMR was followed a year later by Hornady's .17 Mach 2, or [[.17 HM2]], which is based on a slightly lengthened and necked-down .22 Long Rifle cartridge. Both of the .17 caliber rimfires have had widespread support from firearms makers, and while the high-tech, high-velocity .17 caliber jacketed bullets make the [[.17 Rimfire]] cartridges quite a bit more expensive than the .22 caliber versions, they are excellent for shorter-range shooting and still far less expensive than comparable centerfire cartridges. In 2013, Winchester released the [[.17 Winchester Super Magnum]], which utilizes the larger case of the long-obsolete [[.25 Stevens]] allowing for velocities approaching 3000fps with a 20gr bullet and making it the world's fastest rimfire round.<ref>[http://www.outdoorlife.com/blogs/gun-shots/2013/01/worlds-fastest-rimfire John B.

It was employed extensively by [[Nazi Germany]] during [[World War II]], in all branches of the German military. \n\nEnigma has an electromechanical [[rotor machine|rotor mechanism]] that scrambles the 26 letters of the alphabet. In typical use, one person enters text on the Enigma's keyboard and another person writes down which of 26 lights above the keyboard lights up at each key press. If plain text is entered, the lit-up letters are the encoded [[ciphertext]]. Entering ciphertext transforms it back into readable plaintext. The rotor mechanism changes the electrical connections between the keys and the lights with each keypress. The security of the system depends on Enigma machine settings that were changed daily, based on secret key lists distributed in advance, and on other settings that change for each message. The receiving station has to know and use the exact settings employed by the transmitting station to successfully decrypt a message.\n\nAs used in practice, the Enigma encryption was broken from 1932 by [[cryptanalysis|cryptanalytic]] attacks from the [[Polish Cipher Bureau]], which passed its techniques to their French and British allies in 1939. Subsequently, a dedicated decryption centre was established by the United Kingdom at [[Bletchley Park]] as part of the [[Ultra]] program for the rest of the war. \n\nWhile Germany introduced a series of improvements to Enigma, and these hampered decryption efforts to varying degrees, they did not ultimately prevent Britain and its allies from exploiting Enigma-encoded messages as a major source of intelligence during the war. Many commentators say the flow of [[communications intelligence]] from Ultra's decryption of Enigma, [[Lorenz cipher|Lorenz]] and other ciphers shortened the war significantly and may even have altered its outcome.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Intelligence in Warfare|last=Keegan|first=John, Sir|publisher=Alfred A.

Japanese and Italian models were also in use. With its adoption (in slightly modified form) by the German Navy in 1926 and the German Army and Air Force soon after, the name ''Enigma'' became widely known in military circles. Pre-war German military planning emphasized fast, mobile forces and tactics, later known as [[blitzkrieg]], which depend on radio communication for command and coordination. Since adversaries would likely intercept radio signals, messages would have to be protected with secure encoding. Compact and easily portable, the Enigma machine filled that need.\n\n=== Breaking Enigma ===\n{{Main|Cryptanalysis of the Enigma}}\n\nAround December 1932, [[Marian Rejewski]], a Polish mathematician and [[Cryptanalysis|cryptanalyst]], while working at the [[Biuro Szyfr\u00f3w|Polish Cipher Bureau]], used the theory of permutations and flaws in the German military message encipherment procedures to break the message keys of the plugboard Enigma machine. Rejewski achieved this result without knowledge of the wiring of the machine, so the result did not allow the Poles to decrypt actual messages. The French spy [[Hans-Thilo Schmidt]] obtained access to German cipher materials that included the daily keys used in September and October 1932. Those keys included the plugboard settings. The French passed the material to the Poles, and Rejewski used some of that material and the message traffic in September and October to solve for the unknown rotor wiring. Consequently, the Polish mathematicians were able to build their own Enigma machines, which were called [[Polish Enigma double|Enigma doubles]]. Rejewski was aided by cryptanalysts [[Jerzy R\u00f3\u017cycki]] and [[Henryk Zygalski]], both of whom had been recruited with Rejewski from [[Adam Mickiewicz University in Pozna\u0144|Pozna\u0144 University]]. The Polish Cipher Bureau developed techniques to defeat the plugboard and find all components of the daily key, which enabled the Cipher Bureau to read the German Enigma messages starting from January 1933. Over time, the German cryptographic procedures improved, and the Cipher Bureau developed techniques and designed mechanical devices to continue reading the Enigma traffic. As part of that effort, the Poles exploited quirks of the rotors, compiled catalogues, built a [[cyclometer]] to help make a catalogue with 100,000 entries, made [[Zygalski sheets]] and built the electro-mechanical [[Bomba (cryptography)|cryptologic bomb]] to search for rotor settings. In 1938, the Germans added complexity to the Enigma machines that finally became too expensive for the Poles to counter. The Poles had six ''bomby'', but when the Germans added two more rotors, ten times as many ''bomby'' were needed, and the Poles did not have the resources.{{sfn|Kozaczuk|1984|p=63}}\n\nOn 26 and 27 July 1939,<ref>Ralph Erskine: ''The Poles Reveal their Secrets&nbsp;\u2013 Alastair Dennistons's Account of the July 1939 Meeting at Pyry''.

The demonstration represented a vital basis for the later British continuation and effort.\n\nIn September 1939, British Military Mission 4, which included [[Colin Gubbins]] and [[Vera Atkins]], went to Poland to evacuate code-breakers [[Gwido Langer]], [[Marian Rejewski]], [[Jerzy R\u00f3\u017cycki]] and [[Henryk Zygalski]] out of the country with their replica Enigma machines. The Poles were taken across the border into Atkins' native Romania, at the time a neutral country where some of them were interned. Atkins arranged for their release and onward travel to Western Europe to advise the French and British, who at the time were still unable to decrypt German messages.<ref>{{Citation |last= Stevenson |first= William |author-link= William Stevenson (Canadian writer) |title= Spymistress: The True Story of the Greatest Female Secret Agent of World War II |publisher= Arcade Publishing |isbn= 978-1611452310 }}</ref>\n\n[[Gordon Welchman]], who became head of [[Hut 6]] at Bletchley Park, has written: \"Hut 6 [[Ultra]] would never have gotten off the ground if we had not learned from the Poles, in the nick of time, the details both of the German military version of the commercial Enigma machine, and of the operating procedures that were in use.\"{{sfn|Welchman|1982|p=289}} \n\nDuring the war, British cryptologists decrypted a vast number of messages enciphered on Enigma.

Ultra also encompassed decrypts of the German [[Lorenz cipher|Lorenz SZ 40 and 42 machines]] that were used by the German High Command, and decrypts of [[C-36 (cipher machine)|Hagelin ciphers]] and other Italian ciphers and codes, as well as of Japanese ciphers and codes such as [[Type B Cipher Machine|Purple]] and [[Japanese naval codes#JN-25|JN-25]].</ref>\n\nThough Enigma had some cryptographic weaknesses, in practice it was German procedural flaws, operator mistakes, failure to systematically introduce changes in encipherment procedures, and Allied capture of key tables and hardware that, during the war, enabled Allied cryptologists to succeed and \"turned the tide\" in the Allies' favour.{{sfn|Kahn|1991}}{{sfn|Stripp|1993}}\n\n=== Etymology ===\nThe word ''[[:wikt:enigma|enigma]]'' is the Latin word for riddle, derived from the Ancient Greek word ''a\u00ednigma'' (\u03b1\u03af\u03bd\u03b9\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1) used in English, but not native German.\n\n== Design ==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2007-0705-502, Chiffriermaschine \"Enigma\".jpg|thumb|upright|Enigma in use, 1943]]\nLike other rotor machines, the Enigma machine is a combination of mechanical and electrical subsystems. The mechanical subsystem consists of a [[alphanumeric keyboard|keyboard]]; a set of rotating disks called ''rotors'' arranged adjacently along a [[axle|spindle]]; one of various stepping components to turn at least one rotor with each key press, and a series of lamps, one for each letter.\n\n=== Electrical pathway ===\n[[File:Enigma wiring kleur.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Enigma wiring diagram with arrows and the numbers 1 to 9 showing how current flows from key depression to a lamp being lit. The ''A'' key is encoded to the ''D'' lamp. D yields A, but A never yields A; this property was due to a patented feature unique to the Enigmas, and could be exploited by cryptanalysts in some situations.]]\nThe mechanical parts act by forming a varying [[electrical network|electrical circuit]]. When a key is pressed, one or more rotors rotate on the spindle. On the sides of the rotors are a series of electrical contacts that, after rotation, line up with contacts on the other rotors or fixed wiring on either end of the spindle. When the rotors are properly aligned, each key on the keyboard is connected to a unique electrical pathway through the series of contacts and internal wiring. Current, typically from a battery, flows through the pressed key, into the newly configured set of circuits and back out again, ultimately lighting one display [[Electric light|lamp]], which shows the output letter. For example, when encrypting a message starting ''ANX...'', the operator would first press the ''A'' key, and the ''Z'' lamp might light, so ''Z'' would be the first letter of the [[ciphertext]]. The operator would next press ''N'', and then ''X'' in the same fashion, and so on.\n\n[[File:Enigma-action.svg|thumb|upright|The scrambling action of Enigma's rotors is shown for two consecutive letters with the right-hand rotor moving one position between them.]]\nCurrent flowed from the battery (1) through a depressed bi-directional keyboard switch (2) to the plugboard (3). Next, it passed through the (unused in this instance, so shown closed) plug \"A\" (3) via the entry wheel (4), through the wiring of the three (Wehrmacht Enigma) or four (''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' M4 and ''Abwehr'' variants) installed rotors (5), and entered the reflector (6). The reflector returned the current, via an entirely different path, back through the rotors (5) and entry wheel (4), proceeding through plug \"S\" (7) connected with a cable (8) to plug \"D\", and another bi-directional switch (9) to light the appropriate lamp.<ref name=\"Rijmenants\">Rijmenants, Dirk; [http://users.telenet.be/d.rijmenants/en/enigmatech.htm Technical details of the Enigma machine] Cipher Machines & Cryptology</ref>\n\nThe repeated changes of electrical path through an Enigma scrambler implemented a [[polyalphabetic cipher|polyalphabetic substitution cipher]] that provided Enigma's security. The diagram on the right shows how the electrical pathway changed with each key depression, which caused rotation of at least the right-hand rotor. Current passed into the set of rotors, into and back out of the reflector, and out through the rotors again. The greyed-out lines are other possible paths within each rotor; these are hard-wired from one side of each rotor to the other. The letter ''A'' encrypts differently with consecutive key presses, first to ''G'', and then to ''C''. This is because the right-hand rotor has stepped, sending the signal on a completely different route. Eventually other rotors step with a key press.\n\n=== Rotors ===\n[[File:Enigma rotors with alphabet rings.jpg|thumb|Enigma rotor assembly. In the Wehrmacht Enigma, the three installed movable rotors are sandwiched between two fixed wheels: the entry wheel, on the right, and the reflector on the left.]]\n{{Main|Enigma rotor details}}\nThe rotors (alternatively ''wheels'' or ''drums'', ''Walzen'' in German) formed the heart of an Enigma machine. Each rotor was a disc approximately {{convert|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter made from [[Ebonite]] or [[Bakelite]] with 26 [[brass]], spring-loaded, [[electrical contact]] pins arranged in a circle on one face; the other side housing the corresponding number of circular plates [[electrical contacts]]. The pins and contacts represent the [[alphabet]]&nbsp;\u2014 typically the 26 letters A\u2013Z, as will be assumed for the rest of this description. When the rotors were mounted side-by-side on the spindle, the pins of one rotor rested against the plate contacts of the neighbouring rotor, forming an electrical connection. Inside the body of the rotor, 26 wires connected each pin on one side to a contact on the other in a complex pattern. Most of the rotors were identified by Roman numerals, and each issued copy of rotor I was wired identically to all others. The same was true for the special thin beta and gamma rotors used in the M4 naval variant.\n\n[[File:enigma-rotors.jpg|thumb|left|Three Enigma rotors and the shaft, on which they are placed when in use.]]\nBy itself, a rotor performs only a very simple type of [[encryption]], a simple [[substitution cipher]]. For example, the pin corresponding to the letter ''E'' might be wired to the contact for letter ''T'' on the opposite face, and so on. Enigma's security came from using several rotors in series (usually three or four) and the regular stepping movement of the rotors, thus implementing a polyalphabetic substitution cipher.\n\nWhen placed in an Enigma, each rotor can be set to one of 26 possible positions. When inserted, it can be turned by hand using the grooved finger-wheel, which protrudes from the internal Enigma cover when closed. So that the operator can know the rotor's position, each had an ''alphabet tyre'' (or letter ring) attached to the outside of the rotor disc, with 26 characters (typically letters); one of these could be seen through the window, thus indicating the rotational position of the rotor. In early models, the alphabet ring was fixed to the rotor disc. A later improvement was the ability to adjust the alphabet ring relative to the rotor disc. The position of the ring was known as the ''Ringstellung'' (\"ring setting\"), and was a part of the initial setting prior to an operating session. In modern terms it was a part of the [[initialization vector]].\n\n[[File:Enigma rotors and spindle showing contacts rachet and notch.jpg|thumb|left|Two Enigma rotors showing electrical contacts, stepping ratchet (on the left) and notch (on the right-hand rotor opposite '''D''').]]\nEach rotor contained one or more notches that controlled rotor stepping. In the military variants, the notches are located on the alphabet ring.\n\nThe Army and Air Force Enigmas were used with several rotors, initially three. On 15 December 1938, this changed to five, from which three were chosen for a given session. Rotors were marked with [[Roman numerals]] to distinguish them: I, II, III, IV and V, all with single notches located at different points on the alphabet ring. This variation was probably intended as a security measure, but ultimately allowed the Polish [[Clock (cryptography)|Clock Method]] and British [[Banburismus]] attacks.\n\nThe Naval version of the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' Enigma had always been issued with more rotors than the other services: At first six, then seven, and finally eight. The additional rotors were marked VI, VII and VIII, all with different wiring, and had two notches, resulting in more frequent turnover. The four-rotor Naval Enigma (M4) machine accommodated an extra rotor in the same space as the three-rotor version. This was accomplished by replacing the original reflector with a thinner one and by adding a thin fourth rotor. That fourth rotor was one of two types, ''Beta'' or ''Gamma'', and never stepped, but could be manually set to any of 26 positions. One of the 26 made the machine perform identically to the three-rotor machine.\n\n=== Stepping ===\nTo avoid merely implementing a simple (solvable) substitution cipher, every key press caused one or more rotors to step by one twenty-sixth of a full rotation, before the electrical connections were made. This changed the substitution alphabet used for encryption, ensuring that the cryptographic substitution was different at each new rotor position, producing a more formidable polyalphabetic substitution cipher. The stepping mechanism varied slightly from model to model. The right-hand rotor stepped once with each keystroke, and other rotors stepped less frequently.\n\n=== Turnover ===\n[[File:Enigma ratchet.png|thumb|The Enigma stepping motion seen from the side away from the operator. All three ratchet pawls (green) push in unison as a key is depressed. For the first rotor (1), which to the operator is the right-hand rotor, the ratchet (red) is always engaged, and steps with each keypress. Here, the middle rotor (2) is engaged, because the notch in the first rotor is aligned with the pawl; it will step (''turn over'') with the first rotor. The third rotor (3) is not engaged, because the notch in the second rotor is not aligned to the pawl, so it will not engage with the rachet.]]\nThe advancement of a rotor other than the left-hand one was called a ''turnover'' by the British. This was achieved by a [[Ratchet (device)|ratchet and pawl]] mechanism. Each rotor had a ratchet with 26 teeth and every time a key was pressed, the set of spring-loaded pawls moved forward in unison, trying to engage with a ratchet. The alphabet ring of the rotor to the right normally prevented this. As this ring rotated with its rotor, a notch machined into it would eventually align itself with the pawl, allowing it to engage with the ratchet, and advance the rotor on its left. The right-hand pawl, having no rotor and ring to its right, stepped its rotor with every key depression.<ref name=\"doublestepping\" /> For a single-notch rotor in the right-hand position, the middle rotor stepped once for every 26 steps of the right-hand rotor. Similarly for rotors two and three. For a two-notch rotor, the rotor to its left would turn over twice for each rotation.\n\nThe first five rotors to be introduced (I\u2013V) contained one notch each, while the additional naval rotors VI, VII and VIII each had two notches. The position of the notch on each rotor was determined by the letter ring which could be adjusted in relation to the core containing the interconnections. The points on the rings at which they caused the next wheel to move were as follows.<ref>{{cite web| last=Sale|first=Tony|authorlink=Tony Sale|title=Technical specifications of the Enigma rotors| work=Technical Specification of the Enigma|url=http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/enigma/rotorspec.htm|access-date=15 November 2009}}</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|+Position of turnover notches\n|-\n! style=\"width:130pt;\"| Rotor\n! style=\"width:130pt;\"| Turnover position(s)\n! style=\"width:130pt;\"| BP mnemonic\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| |I|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|R|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Royal\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| |II|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|F|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Flags\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| |III|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|W|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Wave\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| |IV|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|K|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Kings\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| |V|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|A|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Above\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|VI, VII and VIII|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|A and N|||\n|}\n\nThe design also included a feature known as ''double-stepping''. This occurred when each pawl aligned with both the ratchet of its rotor and the rotating notched ring of the neighbouring rotor. If a pawl engaged with a ratchet through alignment with a notch, as it moved forward it pushed against both the ratchet and the notch, advancing both rotors. In a three-rotor machine, double-stepping affected rotor two only. If in moving forward the ratchet of rotor three was engaged, rotor two would move again on the subsequent keystroke, resulting in two consecutive steps. Rotor two also pushes rotor one forward after 26 steps, but since rotor one moves forward with every keystroke anyway, there is no double-stepping.<ref name=\"doublestepping\">{{cite journal |first=David |last=Hamer |title=Enigma: Actions Involved in the 'Double-Stepping' of the Middle Rotor |journal=Cryptologia |volume=21 |issue=1 |date=January 1997 |pages=47\u201350 |url=http://www.eclipse.net/~dhamer/downloads/rotorpdf.zip |archivedate=19 July 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719081659/http://www.eclipse.net/~dhamer/downloads/rotorpdf.zip |format=zip |doi=10.1080/0161-119791885779}}</ref> This double-stepping caused the rotors to deviate from [[odometer]]-style regular motion.\n\n<!-- {|\n|-\n| ADM\n|-\n| ADN\n|-\n| ADO\n|-\n| ADP\n|-\n| ADQ\n|-\n| AER\n|-\n| AFS\n|-\n| AFT\n|-\n| AFU\n|} -->\nWith three wheels and only single notches in the first and second wheels, the machine had a period of 26\u00d725\u00d726&nbsp;= 16,900 (not 26\u00d726\u00d726, because of double-stepping).<ref name=\"doublestepping\" /> Historically, messages were limited to a few hundred letters, and so there was no chance of repeating any combined rotor position during a single session, denying cryptanalysts valuable clues.\n\nTo make room for the Naval fourth rotors, the reflector was made much thinner. The fourth rotor fitted into the space made available. No other changes were made, which eased the changeover. Since there were only three pawls, the fourth rotor never stepped, but could be manually set into one of 26 possible positions.\n\nA device that was designed, but not implemented before the war's end, was the ''L\u00fcckenf\u00fcllerwalze'' (gap-fill wheel) that implemented irregular stepping. It allowed field configuration of notches in all 26 positions. If the number of notches was a [[Coprime integers|relative prime]] of 26 and the number of notches were different for each wheel, the stepping would be more unpredictable. Like the Umkehrwalze-D it also allowed the internal wiring to be reconfigured.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cryptomuseum.com/crypto/enigma/lf/index.htm |title=L\u00fcckenf\u00fcllerwalze |publisher=Cryptomuseum.com |date= |access-date=17 July 2012}}</ref>{{Clear}}\n\n=== Entry wheel ===\nThe current entry wheel (''Eintrittswalze'' in German), or entry [[stator]], connects the [[plugboard]] to the rotor assembly. If the plugboard is not present, the entry wheel instead connects the keyboard and lampboard to the rotor assembly. While the exact wiring used is of comparatively little importance to security, it proved an obstacle to Rejewski's progress during his study of the rotor wirings. The commercial Enigma connects the keys in the order of their sequence on a [[QWERTZ]] keyboard: ''Q''&rarr;''A'', ''W''&rarr;''B'', ''E''&rarr;''C'' and so on. The military Enigma connects them in straight alphabetical order: ''A''&rarr;''A'', ''B''&rarr;''B'', ''C''&rarr;''C'', and so on. It took inspired guesswork for Rejewski to penetrate the modification.\n\n=== Reflector ===\n[[File:Enigma insides.agr.jpg|thumb|left|Internal mechanism of an Enigma machine showing the type B reflector and rotor stack.]]\nWith the exception of models ''A'' and ''B'', the last rotor came before a 'reflector' (German: ''Umkehrwalze'', meaning 'reversal rotor'), a patented feature unique to Enigma among the period's various rotor machines. The reflector connected outputs of the last rotor in pairs, redirecting current back through the rotors by a different route. The reflector ensured that Enigma would be [[Involution (mathematics)|self-reciprocal]]; thus, with two identically configured machines, a message could be encrypted on one and decrypted on the other, without the need for a bulky mechanism to switch between encryption and decryption modes. The reflector allowed a more compact design, but it also gave Enigma the property that no letter ever encrypted to itself. This was a severe cryptological flaw that was subsequently exploited by codebreakers.\n\nIn Model 'C', the reflector could be inserted in one of two different positions. In Model 'D', the reflector could be set in 26 possible positions, although it did not move during encryption. In the ''Abwehr'' Enigma, the reflector stepped during encryption in a manner similar to the other wheels.\n\nIn the German Army and Air Force Enigma, the reflector was fixed and did not rotate; there were four versions. The original version was marked 'A', and was replaced by ''Umkehrwalze B'' on 1 November 1937. A third version, ''Umkehrwalze C'' was used briefly in 1940, possibly by mistake, and was solved by [[Hut 6]].<ref name=\"ukwd-1\">Philip Marks, \"Umkehrwalze D: Enigma's Rewirable Reflector&nbsp;\u2014 Part I\", Cryptologia 25(2), April 2001, pp. 101\u2013141</ref> The fourth version, first observed on 2 January 1944, had a rewireable reflector, called ''Umkehrwalze D'', nick-named Uncle Dick by the British, allowing the Enigma operator to alter the connections as part of the key settings.{{Clear}}\n\n=== Plugboard ===\n[[File:Enigma-plugboard.jpg|right|thumb|The plugboard (''Steckerbrett'') was positioned at the front of the machine, below the keys. When in use during World War II, there were ten connections. In this photograph, just two pairs of letters have been swapped (A\u2194J and S\u2194O).]]\nThe plugboard (''Steckerbrett'' in German) permitted variable wiring that could be reconfigured by the operator (visible on the front panel of Figure 1; some of the patch cords can be seen in the lid). It was introduced on German Army versions in 1930, and was soon adopted by the ''[[Reichsmarine]]'' (German Navy). The plugboard contributed more cryptographic strength than an extra rotor. Enigma without a plugboard (known as ''unsteckered Enigma'') can be solved relatively straightforwardly using hand methods; these techniques are generally defeated by the plugboard, driving Allied cryptanalysts to develop special machines to solve it.\n\nA cable placed onto the plugboard connected letters in pairs; for example, ''E'' and ''Q'' might be a steckered pair. The effect was to swap those letters before and after the main rotor scrambling unit. For example, when an operator presses ''E'', the signal was diverted to ''Q'' before entering the rotors. Up to 13 steckered pairs might be used at one time, although only 10 were normally used.\n\nCurrent flowed from the keyboard through the plugboard, and proceeded to the entry-rotor or ''Eintrittswalze''. Each letter on the plugboard had two jacks. Inserting a plug disconnected the upper jack (from the keyboard) and the lower jack (to the entry-rotor) of that letter. The plug at the other end of the crosswired cable was inserted into another letter's jacks, thus switching the connections of the two letters.\n\n=== Accessories ===\n[[File:Enigma-printer-2.jpg|thumb|The ''Schreibmax'' was a printing unit which could be attached to the Enigma, removing the need for laboriously writing down the letters indicated on the light panel.]]\nOther features made various Enigma machines more secure or more convenient.<ref>{{cite web |last=Reuvers |first=Paul |title=Enigma accessories |year=2008 |url=http://www.jproc.ca/crypto/enigma_acc.html |access-date=22 July 2010}}</ref>\n\n==== ''Schreibmax'' ====\nSome M4 Enigmas used the ''Schreibmax'', a small [[Printer (computing)|printer]] that could print the 26 letters on a narrow paper ribbon. This eliminated the need for a second operator to read the lamps and transcribe the letters. The ''Schreibmax'' was placed on top of the Enigma machine and was connected to the lamp panel. To install the printer, the lamp cover and light bulbs had to be removed. It improved both convenience and operational security; the printer could be installed remotely such that the signal officer operating the machine no longer had to see the decrypted [[plaintext]].\n\n==== ''Fernleseger\u00e4t'' ====\nAnother accessory was the remote lamp panel ''Fernleseger\u00e4t''. For machines equipped with the extra panel, the wooden case of the Enigma was wider and could store the extra panel. A lamp panel version could be connected afterwards, but that required, as with the ''Schreibmax'', that the lamp panel and light bulbs be removed.<ref name=\"Rijmenants\" /> The remote panel made it possible for a person to read the decrypted plaintext without the operator seeing it.\n\n==== ''Uhr'' ====\n[[File:Enigma-uhr-box.jpg|right|thumb|upright|The Enigma Uhr attachment]]\nIn 1944, the ''Luftwaffe'' introduced a plugboard switch, called the ''Uhr'' (clock), a small box containing a switch with 40 positions. It replaced the standard plugs. After connecting the plugs, as determined in the daily key sheet, the operator turned the switch into one of the 40 positions, each producing a different combination of plug wiring. Most of these plug connections were, unlike the default plugs, not pair-wise.<ref name=\"Rijmenants\" /> In one switch position, the ''Uhr'' did not swap letters, but simply emulated the 13 stecker wires with plugs.\n\n=== Mathematical analysis ===\nThe Enigma transformation for each letter can be specified mathematically as a product of [[permutation]]s.{{sfn|Rejewski|1980}} Assuming a three-rotor German Army/Air Force Enigma, let {{mvar|P}} denote the plugboard transformation, {{mvar|U}} denote that of the reflector, and {{mvar|L}}, {{mvar|M}}, {{mvar|R}} denote those of the left, middle and right rotors respectively. Then the encryption {{mvar|E}} can be expressed as\n\n:<math>E=PRMLUL^{-1}M^{-1}R^{-1}P^{-1}.</math>\n\nAfter each key press, the rotors turn, changing the transformation. For example, if the right-hand rotor {{mvar|R}} is rotated {{mvar|n}} positions, the transformation becomes\n\n:<math>\\rho^nR\\rho^{-n},</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|\u03c1}} is the [[cyclic permutation]] mapping A to B, B to C, and so forth. Similarly, the middle and left-hand rotors can be represented as {{mvar|j}} and {{mvar|k}} rotations of {{mvar|M}} and {{mvar|L}}. The encryption transformation can then be described as\n\n:<math>E=P\\left(\\rho^n R\\rho^{-n}\\right)\\left(\\rho^j M\\rho^{-j}\\right)\\left(\\rho^{k}L\\rho^{-k}\\right)U\\left(\\rho^kL^{-1}\\rho^{-k}\\right)\\left(\\rho^j M^{-1}\\rho^{-j}\\right)\\left(\\rho^n R^{-1}\\rho^{-n}\\right)P^{-1}.</math>\n\nCombining three rotors from a set of five, each of the 3 rotor settings with 26 positions, and the plugboard with ten pairs of letters connected, the military Enigma has 158,962,555,217,826,360,000 different settings (nearly 159 [[Names of large numbers|quintillion]] or about 67 [[bit]]s).<ref>{{YouTube | id=G2_Q9FoD-oQ | title=158,962,555,217,826,360,000&nbsp;\u2014 Numberphile}}</ref>\n\nNote that (5x4x3) x (26^3) x [26! / (6! x 10! x 2^10)] = 158,962,555,217,826,360,000 \u2248 2<sup>67.1</sup>\n\n== Operation ==\n=== Basic operation ===\n[[File:Encrypting and decrypting using an enigma machine.webm|thumb|Enciphering and deciphering using an Enigma machine]]\nA German Enigma operator would be given a plaintext message to encrypt. After setting up his machine, he would type the message on the Enigma keyboard. For each letter pressed, one lamp lit indicating a different letter according to a [[Pseudorandomness|pseudo-random]] substitution determined by the electrical pathways inside the machine. The letter indicated by the lamp would be recorded, typically by a second operator, as the [[cyphertext]] letter. The action of pressing a key also moved one or more rotors so that the next key press used a different electrical pathway, and thus a different substitution would occur even if the same plaintext letter were entered again. For each key press there was rotation of at least the right hand rotor and less often the other two, resulting in a different [[Pseudorandomness|substitution alphabet]] being used for every letter in the message. This process continued until the message was completed. The cyphertext recorded by the second operator would then be transmitted, usually by radio in [[Morse code]], to an operator of another Enigma machine. This operator would type in the cyphertext and&nbsp;\u2014 as long as all the settings of the deciphering machine were identical to those of the enciphering machine&nbsp;\u2014 for every key press the reverse substitution would occur and the plaintext message would emerge.\n\n=== Details ===\n[[File:Kenngruppenheft.jpg|thumb|German Kenngruppenheft (a U-boat [[codebook]] with grouped key codes).]]\n[[File:Enigma keylist 3 rotor.jpg|thumb|Monthly key list number 649 for the German Air Force Enigma, including settings for the reconfigurable reflector (which only change once every eight days).]]\nIn use, the Enigma required a list of daily key settings and auxiliary documents. In German military practice, communications were divided into separate networks, each using different settings. These communication nets were termed ''keys'' at [[Bletchley Park]], and were assigned [[code name]]s, such as ''Red'', ''Chaffinch'', and ''Shark''. Each unit operating in a network was given the same settings list for its Enigma, valid for a period of time. The procedures for German Naval Enigma were more elaborate and more secure than those in other services and employed auxiliary [[codebook]]s. Navy codebooks were printed in red, water-soluble ink on pink paper so that they could easily be destroyed if they were endangered or if the vessel was sunk.\n\nAn Enigma machine's setting (its [[Key (cryptography)|cryptographic key]] in modern terms; ''Schl\u00fcssel'' in German) specified each operator-adjustable aspect of the machine:\n* Wheel order (''Walzenlage'') \u2013 the choice of rotors and the order in which they are fitted.\n* Ring settings (''Ringstellung'') \u2013 the position of each alphabet ring relative to its rotor wiring.\n* Plug connections (''Steckerverbindungen'') \u2013 the pairs of letters in the plugboard that are connected together.\n* In very late versions, the wiring of the reconfigurable reflector.\n* Starting position of the rotors (''Grundstellung'') \u2013 chosen by the operator, should be different for each message.\n\nFor a message to be correctly encrypted and decrypted, both sender and receiver had to configure their Enigma in the same way; rotor selection and order, ring positions, plugboard connections and starting rotor positions must be identical. Except for the starting positions, these settings were established beforehand, distributed in key lists and changed daily. For example, the settings for the 18th day of the month in the German Luftwaffe Enigma key list number 649 (see image) were as follows:\n* Wheel order: IV, II, V\n* Ring settings: 15, 23, 26\n* Plugboard connections: EJ OY IV AQ KW FX MT PS LU BD\n* Reconfigurable reflector wiring: IU AS DV GL FT OX EZ CH MR KN BQ PW\n* Indicator groups: lsa zbw vcj rxn\n\nEnigma was designed to be secure even if the rotor wiring was known to an opponent, although in practice considerable effort protected the wiring configuration. If the wiring is secret, the total number of possible configurations has been calculated to be around {{val|3e114}} (approximately 380 bits); with known wiring and other operational constraints, this is reduced to around {{val|e=23}} (76 bits).<ref name=\"engima_cryptographic_mathematics\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.nsa.gov/about/_files/cryptologic_heritage/publications/wwii/engima_cryptographic_mathematics.pdf|title=The Cryptographic Mathematics of Enigma|last=Miller|first=A.

A different initial rotor position was used for each message, a concept similar to an [[Initialization vector|initialisation vector]] in modern cryptography. The reason is that encrypting many messages with identical or near-identical settings (termed in cryptanalysis as being ''in [[Cryptanalysis#Depth|depth]]''), would enable an attack using a statistical procedure such as [[William F. Friedman|Friedman's]] [[Index of coincidence]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Friedman| first=W.F.|authorlink=William F.

Publ 22|publisher=Riverbank Laboratories|location=Geneva, Illinois, USA|oclc=55786052|year=1922}}</ref> The starting position for the rotors was transmitted just before the ciphertext, usually after having been enciphered. The exact method used was termed the ''indicator procedure''. Design weakness and operator sloppiness in these indicator procedures were two of the main weaknesses that made cracking Enigma possible.\n\n[[File:Enigma-rotor-windows.jpg|left|thumb|Figure 2. With the inner lid down, the Enigma was ready for use. The finger wheels of the rotors protruded through the lid, allowing the operator to set the rotors, and their current position, here ''RDKP'', was visible to the operator through a set of windows.]]\nOne of the earliest ''indicator procedures'' for the Enigma was cryptographically flawed and allowed Polish cryptanalysts to make the initial breaks into the plugboard Enigma. The procedure had the operator set his machine in accordance with the secret settings that all operators on the net shared. The settings included an initial position for the rotors (the ''Grundstellung''), say, ''AOH''. The operator turned his rotors until ''AOH'' was visible through the rotor windows. At that point, the operator chose his own arbitrary starting position for the message he would send. An operator might select ''EIN'', and that became the ''message setting'' for that encryption session. The operator then typed ''EIN'' into the machine twice, this producing the encrypted indicator, for example ''XHTLOA''. This was then transmitted, at which point the operator would turn the rotors to his message settings, ''EIN'' in this example, and then type the plaintext of the message.\n\nAt the receiving end, the operator set the machine to the initial settings (''AOH'') and typed in the first six letters of the message (''XHTLOA''). In this example, ''EINEIN'' emerged on the lamps, so the operator would learn the ''message setting'' that the sender used to encrypt this message. The receiving operator would set his rotors to ''EIN'', type in the rest of the ciphertext, and get the deciphered message.\n\nThis indicator scheme had two weaknesses. First, the use of a global initial position (''Grundstellung'') meant all message keys used the same polyalphabetic substitution. In later indicator procedures, the operator selected his initial position for encrypting the indicator and sent that initial position in the clear. The second problem was the repetition of the indicator, which was a serious security flaw. The message setting was encoded twice, resulting in a relation between first and fourth, second and fifth, and third and sixth character. These security flaws enabled the Polish Cipher Bureau to break into the pre-war Enigma system as early as 1932. The early indicator procedure was subsequently described by German cryptanalysts as the \"faulty indicator technique\".{{sfn|Huttenhain|Fricke|1945|pp=4,5}}\n\nDuring World War II, codebooks were only used each day to set up the rotors, their ring settings and the plugboard. For each message, the operator selected a random start position, let's say ''WZA'', and a random message key, perhaps ''SXT''. He moved the rotors to the ''WZA'' start position and encoded the message key ''SXT''. Assume the result was ''UHL''. He then set up the message key, ''SXT'', as the start position and encrypted the message. Next, he transmitted the start position, ''WZA'', the encoded message key, ''UHL'', and then the ciphertext. The receiver set up the start position according to the first trigram, ''WZA'', and decoded the second trigram, ''UHL'', to obtain the ''SXT'' message setting. Next, he used this ''SXT'' message setting as the start position to decrypt the message. This way, each ground setting was different and the new procedure avoided the security flaw of double encoded message settings.<ref>Rijmenants, Dirk; [http://users.telenet.be/d.rijmenants/en/enigmaproc.htm Enigma message procedures] Cipher Machines & Cryptology</ref>\n\nThis procedure was used by ''Wehrmacht'' and ''Luftwaffe'' only. The ''Kriegsmarine'' procedures on sending messages with the Enigma were far more complex and elaborate. Prior to encryption the message was encoded using the ''[[Kurzsignale|Kurzsignalheft]]'' code book. The ''Kurzsignalheft'' contained tables to convert sentences into four-letter groups. A great many choices were included, for example, logistic matters such as refuelling and rendezvous with supply ships, positions and grid lists, harbour names, countries, weapons, weather conditions, enemy positions and ships, date and time tables. Another codebook contained the ''[[Discriminant Book|Kenngruppen]]'' and ''Spruchschl\u00fcssel'': the key identification and message key.<ref>Rijmenants, Dirk; [http://users.telenet.be/d.rijmenants/en/kurzsignale.htm Kurzsignalen on German U-boats] Cipher Machines & Cryptology</ref>\n\n=== Additional details ===\nThe Army Enigma machine used only the 26 alphabet characters. Punctuation was replaced with rare character combinations. A space was omitted or replaced with an X. The X was generally used as full-stop.\n\nSome punctuation marks were different in other parts of the armed forces. The ''Wehrmacht'' replaced a comma with ZZ and the question mark with FRAGE or FRAQ.\n\nThe ''Kriegsmarine'' replaced the comma with Y and the question mark with UD. The combination CH, as in \"''Acht''\" (eight) or \"''Richtung''\" (direction), was replaced with Q (AQT, RIQTUNG). Two, three and four zeros were replaced with CENTA, MILLE and MYRIA.\n\nThe ''Wehrmacht'' and the ''Luftwaffe'' transmitted messages in groups of five characters.\n\nThe ''Kriegsmarine'', using the four rotor Enigma, had four-character groups. Frequently used names or words were varied as much as possible. Words like ''Minensuchboot'' (minesweeper) could be written as MINENSUCHBOOT, MINBOOT, MMMBOOT or MMM354. To make cryptanalysis harder, messages were limited to 250 characters.

For example, a given machine configuration that encoded A to L, B to U, C to S, ..., and Z to J could be represented compactly as\n\n LUSHQOXDMZNAIKFREPCYBWVGTJ\n\nand the encoding of a particular character by that configuration could be represented by highlighting the encoded character as in\n\n D > LUS(H)QOXDMZNAIKFREPCYBWVGTJ\n\nSince the operation of an Enigma machine encoding a message is a series of such configurations, each associated with a single character being encoded, a sequence of such representations can be used to represent the operation of the machine as it encodes a message. For example, the process of encoding the first sentence of the main body of the famous \"D\u00f6nitz message\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cryptomuseum.com/crypto/enigma/msg/p1030681.htm|title=Message from D\u00f6nitz&nbsp;\u2014 1 May 1945|access-date=27 November 2018}}</ref> to\n\n RBBF PMHP HGCZ XTDY GAHG UFXG EWKB LKGJ\n\ncan be represented as\n\n 0001 F > KGWNT(R)BLQPAHYDVJIFXEZOCSMU CDTK 25 15 16 26\n 0002 O > UORYTQSLWXZHNM(B)VFCGEAPIJDK CDTL 25 15 16 01\n 0003 L > HLNRSKJAMGF(B)ICUQPDEYOZXWTV CDTM 25 15 16 02\n 0004 G > KPTXIG(F)MESAUHYQBOVJCLRZDNW CDUN 25 15 17 03\n 0005 E > XDYB(P)WOSMUZRIQGENLHVJTFACK CDUO 25 15 17 04\n 0006 N > DLIAJUOVCEXBN(M)GQPWZYFHRKTS CDUP 25 15 17 05\n 0007 D > LUS(H)QOXDMZNAIKFREPCYBWVGTJ CDUQ 25 15 17 06\n 0008 E > JKGO(P)TCIHABRNMDEYLZFXWVUQS CDUR 25 15 17 07\n 0009 S > GCBUZRASYXVMLPQNOF(H)WDKTJIE CDUS 25 15 17 08\n 0010 I > XPJUOWIY(G)CVRTQEBNLZMDKFAHS CDUT 25 15 17 09\n 0011 S > DISAUYOMBPNTHKGJRQ(C)LEZXWFV CDUU 25 15 17 10\n 0012 T > FJLVQAKXNBGCPIRMEOY(Z)WDUHST CDUV 25 15 17 11\n 0013 S > KTJUQONPZCAMLGFHEW(X)BDYRSVI CDUW 25 15 17 12\n 0014 O > ZQXUVGFNWRLKPH(T)MBJYODEICSA CDUX 25 15 17 13\n 0015 F > XJWFR(D)ZSQBLKTVPOIEHMYNCAUG CDUY 25 15 17 14\n 0016 O > FSKTJARXPECNUL(Y)IZGBDMWVHOQ CDUZ 25 15 17 15\n 0017 R > CEAKBMRYUVDNFLTXW(G)ZOIJQPHS CDVA 25 15 18 16\n 0018 T > TLJRVQHGUCXBZYSWFDO(A)IEPKNM CDVB 25 15 18 17\n 0019 B > Y(H)LPGTEBKWICSVUDRQMFONJZAX CDVC 25 15 18 18\n 0020 E > KRUL(G)JEWNFADVIPOYBXZCMHSQT CDVD 25 15 18 19\n 0021 K > RCBPQMVZXY(U)OFSLDEANWKGTIJH CDVE 25 15 18 20\n 0022 A > (F)CBJQAWTVDYNXLUSEZPHOIGMKR CDVF 25 15 18 21\n 0023 N > VFTQSBPORUZWY(X)HGDIECJALNMK CDVG 25 15 18 22\n 0024 N > JSRHFENDUAZYQ(G)XTMCBPIWVOLK CDVH 25 15 18 23\n 0025 T > RCBUTXVZJINQPKWMLAY(E)DGOFSH CDVI 25 15 18 24\n 0026 Z > URFXNCMYLVPIGESKTBOQAJZDH(W) CDVJ 25 15 18 25\n 0027 U > JIOZFEWMBAUSHPCNRQLV(K)TGYXD CDVK 25 15 18 26\n 0028 G > ZGVRKO(B)XLNEIWJFUSDQYPCMHTA CDVL 25 15 18 01\n 0029 E > RMJV(L)YQZKCIEBONUGAWXPDSTFH CDVM 25 15 18 02\n 0030 B > G(K)QRFEANZPBMLHVJCDUXSOYTWI CDWN 25 15 19 03\n 0031 E > YMZT(G)VEKQOHPBSJLIUNDRFXWAC CDWO 25 15 19 04\n 0032 N > PDSBTIUQFNOVW(J)KAHZCEGLMYXR CDWP 25 15 19 05\n\nwhere the letters following each mapping are the letters that appear at the windows at that stage (the only state changes visible to the operator) and the numbers show the underlying physical position of each rotor.\n\nThe character mappings for a given configuration of the machine are in turn the result of a series of such mappings applied by each pass through a component of the machine: the encoding of a character resulting from the application of a given component's mapping serves as the input to the mapping of the subsequent component.

The earliest were commercial models dating from the early 1920s. Starting in the mid-1920s, the German military began to use Enigma, making a number of security-related changes. Various nations either adopted or adapted the design for their own cipher machines.\n\n{|style=\"margin: 1em auto 0 auto;\"\n|-\n| [[File:Enigmas.jpg|upright=2.0|thumb|A selection of seven Enigma machines and paraphernalia exhibited at the U.S. [[National Cryptologic Museum]].

Richard Ritter]] founded the firm of Scherbius & Ritter. They approached the [[Reichsmarine|German Navy]] and Foreign Office with their design, but neither agency was interested. Scherbius & Ritter then assigned the patent rights to Gewerkschaft Securitas, who founded the ''Chiffriermaschinen Aktien-Gesellschaft'' (Cipher Machines Stock Corporation) on 9 July 1923; Scherbius and Ritter were on the board of directors.\n\n==== Enigma A (1923) ====\nChiffriermaschinen AG began advertising a rotor machine, ''Enigma model A'', which was exhibited at the Congress of the [[Universal Postal Union|International Postal Union]] in 1924. The machine was heavy and bulky, incorporating a [[typewriter]]. It measured 65\u00d745\u00d738&nbsp;cm and weighed about {{convert|50|kg|lb}}.\n\n==== Enigma B (1924) ====\nIn 1924 Enigma ''model B'' was introduced, and was of a similar construction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.armyradio.com/publish/Articles/The_Enigma_Code_Breach/Pictures/enigma_type_b.jpg|title=image of Enigma Type B|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051021083422/http://www.armyradio.com/publish/Articles/The_Enigma_Code_Breach/Pictures/enigma_type_b.jpg|archivedate=21 October 2005|df=dmy-all}}</ref> While bearing the Enigma name, both models ''A'' and ''B'' were quite unlike later versions: They differed in physical size and shape, but also cryptographically, in that they lacked the reflector.\n\n==== Enigma C (1926) ====\nThe reflector, suggested by Scherbius' colleague [[Willi Korn]], was introduced in ''Enigma C'' (1926).\n\n''Model C'' was smaller and more portable than its predecessors. It lacked a typewriter, relying on the operator; hence the informal name of \"glowlamp Enigma\" to distinguish it from models ''A'' and ''B''.\n\n==== Enigma D (1927) ====\nThe ''Enigma C'' quickly gave way to ''Enigma D'' (1927). This version was widely used, with shipments to Sweden, the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Japan, Italy, Spain, United States and Poland. In 1927 [[Hugh Foss]] at the British [[Government Communications Headquarters|Government Code and Cypher School]] was able to show that commercial Enigma machines could be broken, provided suitable cribs were available.<ref>Bletchley Park Trust Museum display</ref>\n\n===== \"Navy Cipher D\" =====\nOther countries used Enigma machines. The [[Italian Navy]] adopted the commercial Enigma as \"Navy Cipher D\". The Spanish also used commercial Enigma machines during their [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]]. British codebreakers succeeded in breaking these machines, which lacked a plugboard.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=23}} Enigma machines were also used by diplomatic services.\n\n==== Enigma H (1929) ====\n[[File:Enigma-8-rotor.jpg|right|thumb|upright|A rare 8-rotor printing Enigma model H (1929).]]\nThere was also a large, eight-rotor printing model, the ''Enigma H'', called ''Enigma II'' by the ''[[Reichswehr]]''. In 1933 the Polish Cipher Bureau detected that it was in use for high-level military communication, but it was soon withdrawn, as it was unreliable and jammed frequently.{{sfn|Kozaczuk|1984|p=28}}\n\n==== Enigma K ====\nThe Swiss used a version of Enigma called ''Model K'' or ''Swiss K'' for military and diplomatic use, which was very similar to commercial [[#Enigma D (1927)|Enigma D]]. The machine's code was cracked by Poland, France, the United Kingdom and the United States; the latter code-named it INDIGO. An ''Enigma T'' model, code-named ''Tirpitz'', was used by Japan.\n\n==== Typex ====\nOnce the British figured out Enigma's principle of operation, they fixed the problem with it and created their own, the [[Typex]], which the Germans believed to be unsolvable.<ref>{{YouTube | id=V4V2bpZlqx8 | title=Flaw in the Enigma Code&nbsp;\u2014 Numberphile}}</ref>\n\n=== Military Enigma ===\n==== Funkschl\u00fcssel C ====\nThe Reichsmarine was the first military branch to adopt Enigma. This version, named ''Funkschl\u00fcssel C'' (\"Radio cipher C\"), had been put into production by 1925 and was introduced into service in 1926.{{sfn|Kahn|1991|pp=39\u201341, 299}}\n\nThe keyboard and lampboard contained 29 letters&nbsp;\u2014 A-Z, \u00c4, \u00d6 and \u00dc&nbsp;\u2014 that were arranged alphabetically, as opposed to the QWERTZUI ordering.{{sfn|Ulbricht|2005|p=4}} The rotors had 28 contacts, with the letter ''X'' wired to bypass the rotors unencrypted.{{sfn|Stripp|1993}} Three rotors were chosen from a set of five{{sfn|Kahn|1991|pp=40, 299}} and the reflector could be inserted in one of four different positions, denoted \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 and \u03b4.{{sfn|Bauer|2000|p=108}} The machine was revised slightly in July 1933.{{sfn|Stripp|1993|loc=plate 3}}\n\n==== Enigma G (1928\u20131930) ====\nBy 15 July 1928,{{sfn|Kahn|1991|pp=41, 299}} the German Army (''[[Reichswehr]]'') had introduced their own exclusive version of the Enigma machine, the ''Enigma G''.\n\nThe ''[[Abwehr]]'' used the ''Enigma G'' (the ''Abwehr'' Enigma). This Enigma variant was a four-wheel unsteckered machine with multiple notches on the rotors. This model was equipped with a counter that incremented upon each key press, and so is also known as the \"counter machine\" or the ''Z\u00e4hlwerk'' Enigma.\n\n==== Wehrmacht Enigma I (1930\u20131938) ====\nEnigma machine G was modified to the ''Enigma I'' by June 1930.{{sfn|Kruh|Deavours|2002|p=97}} Enigma I is also known as the ''Wehrmacht'', or \"Services\" Enigma, and was used extensively by German military services and other government organisations (such as the [[Deutsche Reichsbahn#Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (1924-1937)|railways]]{{sfn|Smith|2000|p= 73}}) before and during [[World War II]].\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-769-0229-10A, Frankreich, Guderian, \"Enigma\" cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Heinz Guderian]] in the [[Battle of France]], with an Enigma machine. Note one soldier is keying in text while another writes down the results,]]\nThe major difference between ''Enigma I'' (German Army version from 1930), and commercial Enigma models was the addition of a plugboard to swap pairs of letters, greatly increasing cryptographic strength.\n\nOther differences included the use of a fixed reflector and the relocation of the stepping notches from the rotor body to the movable letter rings. The machine measured {{convert|28|x|34|x|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} and weighed around {{convert|12|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Stripp\">Stripp, 1993</ref>\n\nIn August 1935, the Air Force introduced the Wehrmacht Enigma for their communications.{{sfn|Kruh|Deavours|2002|p=97}}\n\n==== M3 (1934) ====\nBy 1930, the Reichswehr had suggested that the Navy adopt their machine, citing the benefits of increased security (with the plugboard) and easier interservice communications.{{sfn|Kahn|1991|p=43}} The Reichsmarine eventually agreed and in 1934<ref>{{harvnb|Kahn|1991|p=43}} says August 1934. {{harvnb|Kruh|Deavours|2002|p=15}} say October 2004.</ref> brought into service the Navy version of the Army Enigma, designated ''Funkschl\u00fcssel'' ' or ''M3''.

In September, a man identifying himself as \"The Master\" sent a note demanding \u00a325,000 and threatening to destroy the machine if the ransom was not paid. In early October 2000, Bletchley Park officials announced that they would pay the ransom, but the stated deadline passed with no word from the blackmailer. Shortly afterward, the machine was sent anonymously to BBC journalist [[Jeremy Paxman]], missing three rotors.\n\nIn November 2000, an antiques dealer named Dennis Yates was arrested after telephoning ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' to arrange the return of the missing parts. The Enigma machine was returned to Bletchley Park after the incident.

The British [[Typex]] was originally derived from the Enigma patents; Typex even includes features from the patent descriptions that were omitted from the actual Enigma machine. The British paid no royalties for the use of the patents, to protect secrecy. The Typex implementation is not the same as that found in German or other Axis versions.\n\nA Japanese Enigma clone was codenamed GREEN by American cryptographers. Little used, it contained four rotors mounted vertically. In the United States, cryptologist [[William F. Friedman|William Friedman]] designed the [[M-325]], a machine logically similar, although not in construction.\n\nA unique rotor machine was constructed in 2002 by Netherlands-based Tatjana van Vark. This device makes use of 40-point rotors, allowing letters, numbers and some punctuation to be used; each rotor contains 509 parts.<ref>van Vark, Tatjana ''[http://www.tatjavanvark.nl/tvv1/pht10.html The coding machine]''</ref>\n\nMachines like the [[SIGABA]], [[NEMA (machine)|NEMA]], [[Typex]] and so forth, are deliberately not considered to be Enigma derivatives as their internal ciphering functions are not mathematically identical to the Enigma transform.\n\nSeveral software implementations exist, but not all exactly match Enigma behaviour. The most commonly used software derivative (that is not compliant with any hardware implementation of the Enigma) is at EnigmaCo.de. Many Java applet Enigmas only accept single letter entry, complicating use even if the applet is Enigma compliant. Technically, Enigma@home is the largest scale deployment of a software Enigma, but the decoding software does not implement encipherment making it a derivative (as all original machines could cipher and decipher).\n\nA user-friendly three-rotor simulator, where users can select rotors, use the plugboard and define new settings for the rotors and reflectors is available.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://w1tp.com/enigma/enigma_w.zip|title=3 rotor download}}</ref> The output appears in separate windows which can be independently made \"invisible\" to hide decryption.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://membres.multimania.fr/pc1/enigma/ |title=Enigma at Multimania |access-date=2 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402015246/http://membres.multimania.fr/pc1/enigma/ |archive-date=2 April 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Another includes an \"autotyping\" function which takes plaintext from a clipboard and converts it to cyphertext (or vice versa) at one of four speeds.

Turing was played by [[Derek Jacobi]], who also played Turing in a 1996 television adaptation of the play.\n* [[Robert Harris (novelist)|Robert Harris]]' novel ''[[Enigma (novel)|Enigma]]'' (1995) is set against the backdrop of World War II [[Bletchley Park]] and cryptologists working to read Naval Enigma in [[Hut 8]].\n* [[Neal Stephenson]]'s novel ''[[Cryptonomicon]]'' (1999) prominently features the Enigma machine and efforts to break it, and portrays the German U-boat command under [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]] using it in apparently deliberate ignorance of its penetration.\n* Enigma is featured in ''[[The Code Book]]'', a survey of the history of cryptography written by [[Simon Singh]] and published in 1999.\n* The Enigma machine is used as a key plot element in [[Century Rain]] by [[Alastair Reynolds]], set in an alternate Earth where technological research has stagnated and the Enigma is the highest level of encryption available both to civilians and military.\n\n; Films\n* ''[[Sekret Enigmy]]'' (1979; translation: ''The Enigma Secret''), is a Polish film dealing with Polish aspects of the subject.<ref>{{IMDb title|tt0079878}}</ref>\n* The plot of the film ''[[U-571 (film)|U-571]]'' (released in 2000) revolves around an attempt by American, rather than British, forces to seize an Enigma machine from a German U-boat.\n* The 2001 war comedy film ''[[All the Queen's Men]]'' featured a fictitious British plot to capture an Engima machine by infiltrating the Enigma factory with men disguised as women.\n* Harris' book, with substantial changes in plot, was adapted as the film ''[[Enigma (2001 film)|Enigma]]'' (2001), directed by [[Michael Apted]] and starring [[Kate Winslet]] and [[Dougray Scott]]. The film was criticised for historical inaccuracies, including neglect of the role of [[Poland]]'s ''[[Biuro Szyfr\u00f3w]]''. The film, like the book, makes a Pole the villain, who seeks to betray the secret of Enigma decryption.<ref>{{cite news |author=Laurence Peter|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8158782.stm |title=How Poles cracked Nazi Enigma secret |work=[[BBC News]]|date= 20 July 2009}}</ref>\n* The film ''[[The Imitation Game]]'' (2014) tells the story of [[Alan Turing]] and his attempts to crack the Enigma machine code during World War II.<ref name=ng />\n\n; Television\n* In the British television series ''[[The Bletchley Circle]]'', the [[Typex]] was used by the protagonists during the war, and in Season 2, Episode 4, they visit [[Bletchley Park]] to seek one out, in order to crack the code of the [[black market]] procurer and smuggler Marta, who used the Typex to encode her ledger.

It was employed extensively by [[Nazi Germany]] during [[World War II]], in all branches of the German military. \n\nEnigma has an electromechanical [[rotor machine|rotor mechanism]] that scrambles the 26 letters of the alphabet. In typical use, one person enters text on the Enigma's keyboard and another person writes down which of 26 lights above the keyboard lights up at each key press. If plain text is entered, the lit-up letters are the encoded [[ciphertext]]. Entering ciphertext transforms it back into readable plaintext. The rotor mechanism changes the electrical connections between the keys and the lights with each keypress. The security of the system depends on Enigma machine settings that were changed daily, based on secret key lists distributed in advance, and on other settings that change for each message. The receiving station has to know and use the exact settings employed by the transmitting station to successfully decrypt a message.\n\nAs used in practice, the Enigma encryption was broken from 1932 by [[cryptanalysis|cryptanalytic]] attacks from the [[Polish Cipher Bureau]], which passed its techniques to their French and British allies in 1939. Subsequently, a dedicated decryption centre was established by the United Kingdom at [[Bletchley Park]] as part of the [[Ultra]] program for the rest of the war. \n\nWhile Germany introduced a series of improvements to Enigma, and these hampered decryption efforts to varying degrees, they did not ultimately prevent Britain and its allies from exploiting Enigma-encoded messages as a major source of intelligence during the war. Many commentators say the flow of [[communications intelligence]] from Ultra's decryption of Enigma, [[Lorenz cipher|Lorenz]] and other ciphers shortened the war significantly and may even have altered its outcome.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Intelligence in Warfare|last=Keegan|first=John, Sir|publisher=Alfred A.

Japanese and Italian models were also in use. With its adoption (in slightly modified form) by the German Navy in 1926 and the German Army and Air Force soon after, the name ''Enigma'' became widely known in military circles. Pre-war German military planning emphasized fast, mobile forces and tactics, later known as [[blitzkrieg]], which depend on radio communication for command and coordination. Since adversaries would likely intercept radio signals, messages would have to be protected with secure encoding. Compact and easily portable, the Enigma machine filled that need.\n\n=== Breaking Enigma ===\n{{Main|Cryptanalysis of the Enigma}}\n\nAround December 1932, [[Marian Rejewski]], a Polish mathematician and [[Cryptanalysis|cryptanalyst]], while working at the [[Biuro Szyfr\u00f3w|Polish Cipher Bureau]], used the theory of permutations and flaws in the German military message encipherment procedures to break the message keys of the plugboard Enigma machine. Rejewski achieved this result without knowledge of the wiring of the machine, so the result did not allow the Poles to decrypt actual messages. The French spy [[Hans-Thilo Schmidt]] obtained access to German cipher materials that included the daily keys used in September and October 1932. Those keys included the plugboard settings. The French passed the material to the Poles, and Rejewski used some of that material and the message traffic in September and October to solve for the unknown rotor wiring. Consequently, the Polish mathematicians were able to build their own Enigma machines, which were called [[Polish Enigma double|Enigma doubles]]. Rejewski was aided by cryptanalysts [[Jerzy R\u00f3\u017cycki]] and [[Henryk Zygalski]], both of whom had been recruited with Rejewski from [[Adam Mickiewicz University in Pozna\u0144|Pozna\u0144 University]]. The Polish Cipher Bureau developed techniques to defeat the plugboard and find all components of the daily key, which enabled the Cipher Bureau to read the German Enigma messages starting from January 1933. Over time, the German cryptographic procedures improved, and the Cipher Bureau developed techniques and designed mechanical devices to continue reading the Enigma traffic. As part of that effort, the Poles exploited quirks of the rotors, compiled catalogues, built a [[cyclometer]] to help make a catalogue with 100,000 entries, made [[Zygalski sheets]] and built the electro-mechanical [[Bomba (cryptography)|cryptologic bomb]] to search for rotor settings. In 1938, the Germans added complexity to the Enigma machines that finally became too expensive for the Poles to counter. The Poles had six ''bomby'', but when the Germans added two more rotors, ten times as many ''bomby'' were needed, and the Poles did not have the resources.{{sfn|Kozaczuk|1984|p=63}}\n\nOn 26 and 27 July 1939,<ref>Ralph Erskine: ''The Poles Reveal their Secrets&nbsp;\u2013 Alastair Dennistons's Account of the July 1939 Meeting at Pyry''.

The demonstration represented a vital basis for the later British continuation and effort.\n\nIn September 1939, British Military Mission 4, which included [[Colin Gubbins]] and [[Vera Atkins]], went to Poland to evacuate code-breakers [[Gwido Langer]], [[Marian Rejewski]], [[Jerzy R\u00f3\u017cycki]] and [[Henryk Zygalski]] out of the country with their replica Enigma machines. The Poles were taken across the border into Atkins' native Romania, at the time a neutral country where some of them were interned. Atkins arranged for their release and onward travel to Western Europe to advise the French and British, who at the time were still unable to decrypt German messages.<ref>{{Citation |last= Stevenson |first= William |author-link= William Stevenson (Canadian writer) |title= Spymistress: The True Story of the Greatest Female Secret Agent of World War II |publisher= Arcade Publishing |isbn= 978-1611452310 }}</ref>\n\n[[Gordon Welchman]], who became head of [[Hut 6]] at Bletchley Park, has written: \"Hut 6 [[Ultra]] would never have gotten off the ground if we had not learned from the Poles, in the nick of time, the details both of the German military version of the commercial Enigma machine, and of the operating procedures that were in use.\"{{sfn|Welchman|1982|p=289}} \n\nDuring the war, British cryptologists decrypted a vast number of messages enciphered on Enigma. The intelligence gleaned from this source, codenamed \"[[Ultra]]\" by the British, was a substantial aid to the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] war effort.<ref>Much of the German cipher traffic was encrypted on the Enigma machine, and the term \"Ultra\" has often been used almost synonymously with \"[[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma|Enigma decrypts]]\". Ultra also encompassed decrypts of the German [[Lorenz cipher|Lorenz SZ 40 and 42 machines]] that were used by the German High Command, and decrypts of [[C-36 (cipher machine)|Hagelin ciphers]] and other Italian ciphers and codes, as well as of Japanese ciphers and codes such as [[Type B Cipher Machine|Purple]] and [[Japanese naval codes#JN-25|JN-25]].</ref>\n\nThough Enigma had some cryptographic weaknesses, in practice it was German procedural flaws, operator mistakes, failure to systematically introduce changes in encipherment procedures, and Allied capture of key tables and hardware that, during the war, enabled Allied cryptologists to succeed and \"turned the tide\" in the Allies' favour.{{sfn|Kahn|1991}}{{sfn|Stripp|1993}}\n\n=== Etymology ===\nThe word ''[[:wikt:enigma|enigma]]'' is the Latin word for riddle, derived from the Ancient Greek word ''a\u00ednigma'' (\u03b1\u03af\u03bd\u03b9\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1) used in English, but not native German.\n\n== Design ==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2007-0705-502, Chiffriermaschine \"Enigma\".jpg|thumb|upright|Enigma in use, 1943]]\nLike other rotor machines, the Enigma machine is a combination of mechanical and electrical subsystems. The mechanical subsystem consists of a [[alphanumeric keyboard|keyboard]]; a set of rotating disks called ''rotors'' arranged adjacently along a [[axle|spindle]]; one of various stepping components to turn at least one rotor with each key press, and a series of lamps, one for each letter.\n\n=== Electrical pathway ===\n[[File:Enigma wiring kleur.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Enigma wiring diagram with arrows and the numbers 1 to 9 showing how current flows from key depression to a lamp being lit. The ''A'' key is encoded to the ''D'' lamp. D yields A, but A never yields A; this property was due to a patented feature unique to the Enigmas, and could be exploited by cryptanalysts in some situations.]]\nThe mechanical parts act by forming a varying [[electrical network|electrical circuit]]. When a key is pressed, one or more rotors rotate on the spindle. On the sides of the rotors are a series of electrical contacts that, after rotation, line up with contacts on the other rotors or fixed wiring on either end of the spindle. When the rotors are properly aligned, each key on the keyboard is connected to a unique electrical pathway through the series of contacts and internal wiring. Current, typically from a battery, flows through the pressed key, into the newly configured set of circuits and back out again, ultimately lighting one display [[Electric light|lamp]], which shows the output letter. For example, when encrypting a message starting ''ANX...'', the operator would first press the ''A'' key, and the ''Z'' lamp might light, so ''Z'' would be the first letter of the [[ciphertext]]. The operator would next press ''N'', and then ''X'' in the same fashion, and so on.\n\n[[File:Enigma-action.svg|thumb|upright|The scrambling action of Enigma's rotors is shown for two consecutive letters with the right-hand rotor moving one position between them.]]\nCurrent flowed from the battery (1) through a depressed bi-directional keyboard switch (2) to the plugboard (3). Next, it passed through the (unused in this instance, so shown closed) plug \"A\" (3) via the entry wheel (4), through the wiring of the three (Wehrmacht Enigma) or four (''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' M4 and ''Abwehr'' variants) installed rotors (5), and entered the reflector (6). The reflector returned the current, via an entirely different path, back through the rotors (5) and entry wheel (4), proceeding through plug \"S\" (7) connected with a cable (8) to plug \"D\", and another bi-directional switch (9) to light the appropriate lamp.<ref name=\"Rijmenants\">Rijmenants, Dirk; [http://users.telenet.be/d.rijmenants/en/enigmatech.htm Technical details of the Enigma machine] Cipher Machines & Cryptology</ref>\n\nThe repeated changes of electrical path through an Enigma scrambler implemented a [[polyalphabetic cipher|polyalphabetic substitution cipher]] that provided Enigma's security. The diagram on the right shows how the electrical pathway changed with each key depression, which caused rotation of at least the right-hand rotor. Current passed into the set of rotors, into and back out of the reflector, and out through the rotors again. The greyed-out lines are other possible paths within each rotor; these are hard-wired from one side of each rotor to the other. The letter ''A'' encrypts differently with consecutive key presses, first to ''G'', and then to ''C''. This is because the right-hand rotor has stepped, sending the signal on a completely different route. Eventually other rotors step with a key press.\n\n=== Rotors ===\n[[File:Enigma rotors with alphabet rings.jpg|thumb|Enigma rotor assembly. In the Wehrmacht Enigma, the three installed movable rotors are sandwiched between two fixed wheels: the entry wheel, on the right, and the reflector on the left.]]\n{{Main|Enigma rotor details}}\nThe rotors (alternatively ''wheels'' or ''drums'', ''Walzen'' in German) formed the heart of an Enigma machine. Each rotor was a disc approximately {{convert|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter made from [[Ebonite]] or [[Bakelite]] with 26 [[brass]], spring-loaded, [[electrical contact]] pins arranged in a circle on one face; the other side housing the corresponding number of circular plates [[electrical contacts]]. The pins and contacts represent the [[alphabet]]&nbsp;\u2014 typically the 26 letters A\u2013Z, as will be assumed for the rest of this description. When the rotors were mounted side-by-side on the spindle, the pins of one rotor rested against the plate contacts of the neighbouring rotor, forming an electrical connection. Inside the body of the rotor, 26 wires connected each pin on one side to a contact on the other in a complex pattern. Most of the rotors were identified by Roman numerals, and each issued copy of rotor I was wired identically to all others. The same was true for the special thin beta and gamma rotors used in the M4 naval variant.\n\n[[File:enigma-rotors.jpg|thumb|left|Three Enigma rotors and the shaft, on which they are placed when in use.]]\nBy itself, a rotor performs only a very simple type of [[encryption]], a simple [[substitution cipher]]. For example, the pin corresponding to the letter ''E'' might be wired to the contact for letter ''T'' on the opposite face, and so on. Enigma's security came from using several rotors in series (usually three or four) and the regular stepping movement of the rotors, thus implementing a polyalphabetic substitution cipher.\n\nWhen placed in an Enigma, each rotor can be set to one of 26 possible positions. When inserted, it can be turned by hand using the grooved finger-wheel, which protrudes from the internal Enigma cover when closed. So that the operator can know the rotor's position, each had an ''alphabet tyre'' (or letter ring) attached to the outside of the rotor disc, with 26 characters (typically letters); one of these could be seen through the window, thus indicating the rotational position of the rotor. In early models, the alphabet ring was fixed to the rotor disc. A later improvement was the ability to adjust the alphabet ring relative to the rotor disc. The position of the ring was known as the ''Ringstellung'' (\"ring setting\"), and was a part of the initial setting prior to an operating session. In modern terms it was a part of the [[initialization vector]].\n\n[[File:Enigma rotors and spindle showing contacts rachet and notch.jpg|thumb|left|Two Enigma rotors showing electrical contacts, stepping ratchet (on the left) and notch (on the right-hand rotor opposite '''D''').]]\nEach rotor contained one or more notches that controlled rotor stepping. In the military variants, the notches are located on the alphabet ring.\n\nThe Army and Air Force Enigmas were used with several rotors, initially three. On 15 December 1938, this changed to five, from which three were chosen for a given session. Rotors were marked with [[Roman numerals]] to distinguish them: I, II, III, IV and V, all with single notches located at different points on the alphabet ring. This variation was probably intended as a security measure, but ultimately allowed the Polish [[Clock (cryptography)|Clock Method]] and British [[Banburismus]] attacks.\n\nThe Naval version of the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' Enigma had always been issued with more rotors than the other services: At first six, then seven, and finally eight. The additional rotors were marked VI, VII and VIII, all with different wiring, and had two notches, resulting in more frequent turnover. The four-rotor Naval Enigma (M4) machine accommodated an extra rotor in the same space as the three-rotor version. This was accomplished by replacing the original reflector with a thinner one and by adding a thin fourth rotor. That fourth rotor was one of two types, ''Beta'' or ''Gamma'', and never stepped, but could be manually set to any of 26 positions. One of the 26 made the machine perform identically to the three-rotor machine.\n\n=== Stepping ===\nTo avoid merely implementing a simple  ( solvable) substitution cipher, every key press caused one or more rotors to step by one twenty-sixth of a full rotation, before the electrical connections were made. This changed the substitution alphabet used for encryption, ensuring that the cryptographic substitution was different at each new rotor position, producing a more formidable polyalphabetic substitution cipher. The stepping mechanism varied slightly from model to model. The right-hand rotor stepped once with each keystroke, and other rotors stepped less frequently.\n\n=== Turnover ===\n[[File:Enigma ratchet.png|thumb|The Enigma stepping motion seen from the side away from the operator. All three ratchet pawls (green) push in unison as a key is depressed. For the first rotor (1), which to the operator is the right-hand rotor, the ratchet (red) is always engaged, and steps with each keypress. Here, the middle rotor (2) is engaged, because the notch in the first rotor is aligned with the pawl; it will step (''turn over'') with the first rotor. The third rotor (3) is not engaged, because the notch in the second rotor is not aligned to the pawl, so it will not engage with the rachet.]]\nThe advancement of a rotor other than the left-hand one was called a ''turnover'' by the British. This was achieved by a [[Ratchet (device)|ratchet and pawl]] mechanism. Each rotor had a ratchet with 26 teeth and every time a key was pressed, the set of spring-loaded pawls moved forward in unison, trying to engage with a ratchet. The alphabet ring of the rotor to the right normally prevented this. As this ring rotated with its rotor, a notch machined into it would eventually align itself with the pawl, allowing it to engage with the ratchet, and advance the rotor on its left. The right-hand pawl, having no rotor and ring to its right, stepped its rotor with every key depression.<ref name=\"doublestepping\" /> For a single-notch rotor in the right-hand position, the middle rotor stepped once for every 26 steps of the right-hand rotor. Similarly for rotors two and three. For a two-notch rotor, the rotor to its left would turn over twice for each rotation.\n\nThe first five rotors to be introduced (I\u2013V) contained one notch each, while the additional naval rotors VI, VII and VIII each had two notches. The position of the notch on each rotor was determined by the letter ring which could be adjusted in relation to the core containing the interconnections. The points on the rings at which they caused the next wheel to move were as follows.<ref>{{cite web| last=Sale|first=Tony|authorlink=Tony Sale|title=Technical specifications of the Enigma rotors| work=Technical Specification of the Enigma|url=http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/enigma/rotorspec.htm|access-date=15 November 2009}}</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|+Position of turnover notches\n|-\n! style=\"width:130pt;\"| Rotor\n! style=\"width:130pt;\"| Turnover position(s)\n! style=\"width:130pt;\"| BP mnemonic\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| |I|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|R|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Royal\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| |II|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|F|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Flags\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| |III|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|W|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Wave\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| |IV|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|K|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Kings\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| |V|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|A|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Above\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|VI, VII and VIII|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|A and N|||\n|}\n\nThe design also included a feature known as ''double-stepping''. This occurred when each pawl aligned with both the ratchet of its rotor and the rotating notched ring of the neighbouring rotor. If a pawl engaged with a ratchet through alignment with a notch, as it moved forward it pushed against both the ratchet and the notch, advancing both rotors. In a three-rotor machine, double-stepping affected rotor two only. If in moving forward the ratchet of rotor three was engaged, rotor two would move again on the subsequent keystroke, resulting in two consecutive steps. Rotor two also pushes rotor one forward after 26 steps, but since rotor one moves forward with every keystroke anyway, there is no double-stepping.<ref name=\"doublestepping\">{{cite journal |first=David |last=Hamer |title=Enigma: Actions Involved in the 'Double-Stepping' of the Middle Rotor |journal=Cryptologia |volume=21 |issue=1 |date=January 1997 |pages=47\u201350 |url=http://www.eclipse.net/~dhamer/downloads/rotorpdf.zip |archivedate=19 July 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719081659/http://www.eclipse.net/~dhamer/downloads/rotorpdf.zip |format=zip |doi=10.1080/0161-119791885779}}</ref> This double-stepping caused the rotors to deviate from [[odometer]]-style regular motion.\n\n<!-- {|\n|-\n| ADM\n|-\n| ADN\n|-\n| ADO\n|-\n| ADP\n|-\n| ADQ\n|-\n| AER\n|-\n| AFS\n|-\n| AFT\n|-\n| AFU\n|} -->\nWith three wheels and only single notches in the first and second wheels, the machine had a period of 26\u00d725\u00d726&nbsp;= 16,900 (not 26\u00d726\u00d726, because of double-stepping).<ref name=\"doublestepping\" /> Historically, messages were limited to a few hundred letters, and so there was no chance of repeating any combined rotor position during a single session, denying cryptanalysts valuable clues.\n\nTo make room for the Naval fourth rotors, the reflector was made much thinner. The fourth rotor fitted into the space made available. No other changes were made, which eased the changeover. Since there were only three pawls, the fourth rotor never stepped, but could be manually set into one of 26 possible positions.\n\nA device that was designed, but not implemented before the war's end, was the ''L\u00fcckenf\u00fcllerwalze'' (gap-fill wheel) that implemented irregular stepping. It allowed field configuration of notches in all 26 positions. If the number of notches was a [[Coprime integers|relative prime]] of 26 and the number of notches were different for each wheel, the stepping would be more unpredictable. Like the Umkehrwalze-D it also allowed the internal wiring to be reconfigured.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cryptomuseum.com/crypto/enigma/lf/index.htm |title=L\u00fcckenf\u00fcllerwalze |publisher=Cryptomuseum.com |date= |access-date=17 July 2012}}</ref>{{Clear}}\n\n=== Entry wheel ===\nThe current entry wheel (''Eintrittswalze'' in German), or entry [[stator]], connects the [[plugboard]] to the rotor assembly. If the plugboard is not present, the entry wheel instead connects the keyboard and lampboard to the rotor assembly. While the exact wiring used is of comparatively little importance to security, it proved an obstacle to Rejewski's progress during his study of the rotor wirings. The commercial Enigma connects the keys in the order of their sequence on a [[QWERTZ]] keyboard: ''Q''&rarr;''A'', ''W''&rarr;''B'', ''E''&rarr;''C'' and so on. The military Enigma connects them in straight alphabetical order: ''A''&rarr;''A'', ''B''&rarr;''B'', ''C''&rarr;''C'', and so on. It took inspired guesswork for Rejewski to penetrate the modification.\n\n=== Reflector ===\n[[File:Enigma insides.agr.jpg|thumb|left|Internal mechanism of an Enigma machine showing the type B reflector and rotor stack.]]\nWith the exception of models ''A'' and ''B'', the last rotor came before a 'reflector' (German: ''Umkehrwalze'', meaning 'reversal rotor'), a patented feature unique to Enigma among the period's various rotor machines. The reflector connected outputs of the last rotor in pairs, redirecting current back through the rotors by a different route. The reflector ensured that Enigma would be [[Involution (mathematics)|self-reciprocal]]; thus, with two identically configured machines, a message could be encrypted on one and decrypted on the other, without the need for a bulky mechanism to switch between encryption and decryption modes. The reflector allowed a more compact design, but it also gave Enigma the property that no letter ever encrypted to itself. This was a severe cryptological flaw that was subsequently exploited by codebreakers.\n\nIn Model 'C', the reflector could be inserted in one of two different positions. In Model 'D', the reflector could be set in 26 possible positions, although it did not move during encryption. In the ''Abwehr'' Enigma, the reflector stepped during encryption in a manner similar to the other wheels.\n\nIn the German Army and Air Force Enigma, the reflector was fixed and did not rotate; there were four versions. The original version was marked 'A', and was replaced by ''Umkehrwalze B'' on 1 November 1937. A third version, ''Umkehrwalze C'' was used briefly in 1940, possibly by mistake, and was solved by [[Hut 6]].<ref name=\"ukwd-1\">Philip Marks, \"Umkehrwalze D: Enigma's Rewirable Reflector&nbsp;\u2014 Part I\", Cryptologia 25(2), April 2001, pp. 101\u2013141</ref> The fourth version, first observed on 2 January 1944, had a rewireable reflector, called ''Umkehrwalze D'', nick-named Uncle Dick by the British, allowing the Enigma operator to alter the connections as part of the key settings.{{Clear}}\n\n=== Plugboard ===\n[[File:Enigma-plugboard.jpg|right|thumb|The plugboard (''Steckerbrett'') was positioned at the front of the machine, below the keys. When in use during World War II, there were ten connections. In this photograph, just two pairs of letters have been swapped (A\u2194J and S\u2194O).]]\nThe plugboard (''Steckerbrett'' in German) permitted variable wiring that could be reconfigured by the operator (visible on the front panel of Figure 1; some of the patch cords can be seen in the lid). It was introduced on German Army versions in 1930, and was soon adopted by the ''[[Reichsmarine]]'' (German Navy). The plugboard contributed more cryptographic strength than an extra rotor. Enigma without a plugboard (known as ''unsteckered Enigma'') can be solved relatively straightforwardly using hand methods; these techniques are generally defeated by the plugboard, driving Allied cryptanalysts to develop special machines to solve it.\n\nA cable placed onto the plugboard connected letters in pairs; for example, ''E'' and ''Q'' might be a steckered pair. The effect was to swap those letters before and after the main rotor scrambling unit. For example, when an operator presses ''E'', the signal was diverted to ''Q'' before entering the rotors. Up to 13 steckered pairs might be used at one time, although only 10 were normally used.\n\nCurrent flowed from the keyboard through the plugboard, and proceeded to the entry-rotor or ''Eintrittswalze''. Each letter on the plugboard had two jacks. Inserting a plug disconnected the upper jack (from the keyboard) and the lower jack (to the entry-rotor) of that letter. The plug at the other end of the crosswired cable was inserted into another letter's jacks, thus switching the connections of the two letters.\n\n=== Accessories ===\n[[File:Enigma-printer-2.jpg|thumb|The ''Schreibmax'' was a printing unit which could be attached to the Enigma, removing the need for laboriously writing down the letters indicated on the light panel.]]\nOther features made various Enigma machines more secure or more convenient.<ref>{{cite web |last=Reuvers |first=Paul |title=Enigma accessories |year=2008 |url=http://www.jproc.ca/crypto/enigma_acc.html |access-date=22 July 2010}}</ref>\n\n==== ''Schreibmax'' ====\nSome M4 Enigmas used the ''Schreibmax'', a small [[Printer (computing)|printer]] that could print the 26 letters on a narrow paper ribbon. This eliminated the need for a second operator to read the lamps and transcribe the letters. The ''Schreibmax'' was placed on top of the Enigma machine and was connected to the lamp panel. To install the printer, the lamp cover and light bulbs had to be removed. It improved both convenience and operational security; the printer could be installed remotely such that the signal officer operating the machine no longer had to see the decrypted [[plaintext]].\n\n==== ''Fernleseger\u00e4t'' ====\nAnother accessory was the remote lamp panel ''Fernleseger\u00e4t''. For machines equipped with the extra panel, the wooden case of the Enigma was wider and could store the extra panel. A lamp panel version could be connected afterwards, but that required, as with the ''Schreibmax'', that the lamp panel and light bulbs be removed.<ref name=\"Rijmenants\" /> The remote panel made it possible for a person to read the decrypted plaintext without the operator seeing it.\n\n==== ''Uhr'' ====\n[[File:Enigma-uhr-box.jpg|right|thumb|upright|The Enigma Uhr attachment]]\nIn 1944, the ''Luftwaffe'' introduced a plugboard switch, called the ''Uhr'' (clock), a small box containing a switch with 40 positions. It replaced the standard plugs. After connecting the plugs, as determined in the daily key sheet, the operator turned the switch into one of the 40 positions, each producing a different combination of plug wiring. Most of these plug connections were, unlike the default plugs, not pair-wise.<ref name=\"Rijmenants\" /> In one switch position, the ''Uhr'' did not swap letters, but simply emulated the 13 stecker wires with plugs.\n\n=== Mathematical analysis ===\nThe Enigma transformation for each letter can be specified mathematically as a product of [[permutation]]s.{{sfn|Rejewski|1980}} Assuming a three-rotor German Army/Air Force Enigma, let {{mvar|P}} denote the plugboard transformation, {{mvar|U}} denote that of the reflector, and {{mvar|L}}, {{mvar|M}}, {{mvar|R}} denote those of the left, middle and right rotors respectively. Then the encryption {{mvar|E}} can be expressed as\n\n:<math>E=PRMLUL^{-1}M^{-1}R^{-1}P^{-1}.</math>\n\nAfter each key press, the rotors turn, changing the transformation. For example, if the right-hand rotor {{mvar|R}} is rotated {{mvar|n}} positions, the transformation becomes\n\n:<math>\\rho^nR\\rho^{-n},</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|\u03c1}} is the [[cyclic permutation]] mapping A to B, B to C, and so forth. Similarly, the middle and left-hand rotors can be represented as {{mvar|j}} and {{mvar|k}} rotations of {{mvar|M}} and {{mvar|L}}. The encryption transformation can then be described as\n\n:<math>E=P\\left(\\rho^n R\\rho^{-n}\\right)\\left(\\rho^j M\\rho^{-j}\\right)\\left(\\rho^{k}L\\rho^{-k}\\right)U\\left(\\rho^kL^{-1}\\rho^{-k}\\right)\\left(\\rho^j M^{-1}\\rho^{-j}\\right)\\left(\\rho^n R^{-1}\\rho^{-n}\\right)P^{-1}.</math>\n\nCombining three rotors from a set of five, each of the 3 rotor settings with 26 positions, and the plugboard with ten pairs of letters connected, the military Enigma has 158,962,555,217,826,360,000 different settings (nearly 159 [[Names of large numbers|quintillion]] or about 67 [[bit]]s).<ref>{{YouTube | id=G2_Q9FoD-oQ | title=158,962,555,217,826,360,000&nbsp;\u2014 Numberphile}}</ref>\n\nNote that (5x4x3) x (26^3) x [26! / (6! x 10! x 2^10)] = 158,962,555,217,826,360,000 \u2248 2<sup>67.1</sup>\n\n== Operation ==\n=== Basic operation ===\n[[File:Encrypting and decrypting using an enigma machine.webm|thumb|Enciphering and deciphering using an Enigma machine]]\nA German Enigma operator would be given a plaintext message to encrypt. After setting up his machine, he would type the message on the Enigma keyboard. For each letter pressed, one lamp lit indicating a different letter according to a [[Pseudorandomness|pseudo-random]] substitution determined by the electrical pathways inside the machine. The letter indicated by the lamp would be recorded, typically by a second operator, as the [[cyphertext]] letter. The action of pressing a key also moved one or more rotors so that the next key press used a different electrical pathway, and thus a different substitution would occur even if the same plaintext letter were entered again. For each key press there was rotation of at least the right hand rotor and less often the other two, resulting in a different [[Pseudorandomness|substitution alphabet]] being used for every letter in the message. This process continued until the message was completed. The cyphertext recorded by the second operator would then be transmitted, usually by radio in [[Morse code]], to an operator of another Enigma machine. This operator would type in the cyphertext and&nbsp;\u2014 as long as all the settings of the deciphering machine were identical to those of the enciphering machine&nbsp;\u2014 for every key press the reverse substitution would occur and the plaintext message would emerge.\n\n=== Details ===\n[[File:Kenngruppenheft.jpg|thumb|German Kenngruppenheft (a U-boat [[codebook]] with grouped key codes).]]\n[[File:Enigma keylist 3 rotor.jpg|thumb|Monthly key list number 649 for the German Air Force Enigma, including settings for the reconfigurable reflector (which only change once every eight days).]]\nIn use, the Enigma required a list of daily key settings and auxiliary documents. In German military practice, communications were divided into separate networks, each using different settings. These communication nets were termed ''keys'' at [[Bletchley Park]], and were assigned [[code name]]s, such as ''Red'', ''Chaffinch'', and ''Shark''. Each unit operating in a network was given the same settings list for its Enigma, valid for a period of time. The procedures for German Naval Enigma were more elaborate and more secure than those in other services and employed auxiliary [[codebook]]s. Navy codebooks were printed in red, water-soluble ink on pink paper so that they could easily be destroyed if they were endangered or if the vessel was sunk.\n\nAn Enigma machine's setting (its [[Key (cryptography)|cryptographic key]] in modern terms; ''Schl\u00fcssel'' in German) specified each operator-adjustable aspect of the machine:\n* Wheel order (''Walzenlage'') \u2013 the choice of rotors and the order in which they are fitted.\n* Ring settings (''Ringstellung'') \u2013 the position of each alphabet ring relative to its rotor wiring.\n* Plug connections (''Steckerverbindungen'') \u2013 the pairs of letters in the plugboard that are connected together.\n* In very late versions, the wiring of the reconfigurable reflector.\n* Starting position of the rotors (''Grundstellung'') \u2013 chosen by the operator, should be different for each message.\n\nFor a message to be correctly encrypted and decrypted, both sender and receiver had to configure their Enigma in the same way; rotor selection and order, ring positions, plugboard connections and starting rotor positions must be identical. Except for the starting positions, these settings were established beforehand, distributed in key lists and changed daily. For example, the settings for the 18th day of the month in the German Luftwaffe Enigma key list number 649 (see image) were as follows:\n* Wheel order: IV, II, V\n* Ring settings: 15, 23, 26\n* Plugboard connections: EJ OY IV AQ KW FX MT PS LU BD\n* Reconfigurable reflector wiring: IU AS DV GL FT OX EZ CH MR KN BQ PW\n* Indicator groups: lsa zbw vcj rxn\n\nEnigma was designed to be secure even if the rotor wiring was known to an opponent, although in practice considerable effort protected the wiring configuration. If the wiring is secret, the total number of possible configurations has been calculated to be around {{val|3e114}} (approximately 380 bits); with known wiring and other operational constraints, this is reduced to around {{val|e=23}} (76 bits).<ref name=\"engima_cryptographic_mathematics\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.nsa.gov/about/_files/cryptologic_heritage/publications/wwii/engima_cryptographic_mathematics.pdf|title=The Cryptographic Mathematics of Enigma|last=Miller|first=A. Ray|publisher=National Security Agency|year=2001|ref=harv}}</ref> Users of Enigma were confident of its security, because of the large number of possibilities; it was not then feasible for an adversary to even begin to try a [[brute-force attack]].\n\n=== Indicator ===\n{{See also|Cryptanalysis#Indicator}}\nMost of the key was kept constant for a set time period, typically a day. A different initial rotor position was used for each message, a concept similar to an [[Initialization vector|initialisation vector]] in modern cryptography. The reason is that encrypting many messages with identical or near-identical settings (termed in cryptanalysis as being ''in [[Cryptanalysis#Depth|depth]]''), would enable an attack using a statistical procedure such as [[William F. Friedman|Friedman's]] [[Index of coincidence]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Friedman| first=W.F.|authorlink=William F.

Publ 22|publisher=Riverbank Laboratories|location=Geneva, Illinois, USA|oclc=55786052|year=1922}}</ref> The starting position for the rotors was transmitted just before the ciphertext, usually after having been enciphered. The exact method used was termed the ''indicator procedure''. Design weakness and operator sloppiness in these indicator procedures were two of the main weaknesses that made cracking Enigma possible.\n\n[[File:Enigma-rotor-windows.jpg|left|thumb|Figure 2. With the inner lid down, the Enigma was ready for use. The finger wheels of the rotors protruded through the lid, allowing the operator to set the rotors, and their current position, here ''RDKP'', was visible to the operator through a set of windows.]]\nOne of the earliest ''indicator procedures'' for the Enigma was cryptographically flawed and allowed Polish cryptanalysts to make the initial breaks into the plugboard Enigma. The procedure had the operator set his machine in accordance with the secret settings that all operators on the net shared. The settings included an initial position for the rotors (the ''Grundstellung''), say, ''AOH''. The operator turned his rotors until ''AOH'' was visible through the rotor windows. At that point, the operator chose his own arbitrary starting position for the message he would send. An operator might select ''EIN'', and that became the ''message setting'' for that encryption session. The operator then typed ''EIN'' into the machine twice, this producing the encrypted indicator, for example ''XHTLOA''. This was then transmitted, at which point the operator would turn the rotors to his message settings, ''EIN'' in this example, and then type the plaintext of the message.\n\nAt the receiving end, the operator set the machine to the initial settings (''AOH'') and typed in the first six letters of the message (''XHTLOA''). In this example, ''EINEIN'' emerged on the lamps, so the operator would learn the ''message setting'' that the sender used to encrypt this message. The receiving operator would set his rotors to ''EIN'', type in the rest of the ciphertext, and get the deciphered message.\n\nThis indicator scheme had two weaknesses. First, the use of a global initial position (''Grundstellung'') meant all message keys used the same polyalphabetic substitution. In later indicator procedures, the operator selected his initial position for encrypting the indicator and sent that initial position in the clear. The second problem was the repetition of the indicator, which was a serious security flaw. The message setting was encoded twice, resulting in a relation between first and fourth, second and fifth, and third and sixth character. These security flaws enabled the Polish Cipher Bureau to break into the pre-war Enigma system as early as 1932. The early indicator procedure was subsequently described by German cryptanalysts as the \"faulty indicator technique\".{{sfn|Huttenhain|Fricke|1945|pp=4,5}}\n\nDuring World War II, codebooks were only used each day to set up the rotors, their ring settings and the plugboard. For each message, the operator selected a random start position, let's say ''WZA'', and a random message key, perhaps ''SXT''. He moved the rotors to the ''WZA'' start position and encoded the message key ''SXT''. Assume the result was ''UHL''. He then set up the message key, ''SXT'', as the start position and encrypted the message. Next, he transmitted the start position, ''WZA'', the encoded message key, ''UHL'', and then the ciphertext. The receiver set up the start position according to the first trigram, ''WZA'', and decoded the second trigram, ''UHL'', to obtain the ''SXT'' message setting. Next, he used this ''SXT'' message setting as the start position to decrypt the message. This way, each ground setting was different and the new procedure avoided the security flaw of double encoded message settings.<ref>Rijmenants, Dirk; [http://users.telenet.be/d.rijmenants/en/enigmaproc.htm Enigma message procedures] Cipher Machines & Cryptology</ref>\n\nThis procedure was used by ''Wehrmacht'' and ''Luftwaffe'' only. The ''Kriegsmarine'' procedures on sending messages with the Enigma were far more complex and elaborate. Prior to encryption the message was encoded using the ''[[Kurzsignale|Kurzsignalheft]]'' code book. The ''Kurzsignalheft'' contained tables to convert sentences into four-letter groups. A great many choices were included, for example, logistic matters such as refuelling and rendezvous with supply ships, positions and grid lists, harbour names, countries, weapons, weather conditions, enemy positions and ships, date and time tables. Another codebook contained the ''[[Discriminant Book|Kenngruppen]]'' and ''Spruchschl\u00fcssel'': the key identification and message key.<ref>Rijmenants, Dirk; [http://users.telenet.be/d.rijmenants/en/kurzsignale.htm Kurzsignalen on German U-boats] Cipher Machines & Cryptology</ref>\n\n=== Additional details ===\nThe Army Enigma machine used only the 26 alphabet characters. Punctuation was replaced with rare character combinations. A space was omitted or replaced with an X. The X was generally used as full-stop.\n\nSome punctuation marks were different in other parts of the armed forces. The ''Wehrmacht'' replaced a comma with ZZ and the question mark with FRAGE or FRAQ.\n\nThe ''Kriegsmarine'' replaced the comma with Y and the question mark with UD. The combination CH, as in \"''Acht''\" (eight) or \"''Richtung''\" (direction), was replaced with Q (AQT, RIQTUNG). Two, three and four zeros were replaced with CENTA, MILLE and MYRIA.\n\nThe ''Wehrmacht'' and the ''Luftwaffe'' transmitted messages in groups of five characters.\n\nThe ''Kriegsmarine'', using the four rotor Enigma, had four-character groups. Frequently used names or words were varied as much as possible. Words like ''Minensuchboot'' (minesweeper) could be written as MINENSUCHBOOT, MINBOOT, MMMBOOT or MMM354. To make cryptanalysis harder, messages were limited to 250 characters. Longer messages were divided into several parts, each using a different message key.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/documents/egenproc/eniggnix.htm|title=The translated 1940 ''Enigma General Procedure''|publisher=codesandciphers.org.uk|access-date=16 October 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/documents/officer/officerx.htm|title=The translated 1940 ''Enigma Officer and Staff Procedure''|publisher=codesandciphers.org.uk|access-date=16 October 2006}}</ref>{{Clear}}\n\n=== Example encoding process ===\nThe character substitutions by the Enigma machine as a whole can be expressed as a string of letters with each position occupied by the character that will replace the character at the corresponding position in the alphabet. For example, a given machine configuration that encoded A to L, B to U, C to S, ..., and Z to J could be represented compactly as\n\n LUSHQOXDMZNAIKFREPCYBWVGTJ\n\nand the encoding of a particular character by that configuration could be represented by highlighting the encoded character as in\n\n D > LUS(H)QOXDMZNAIKFREPCYBWVGTJ\n\nSince the operation of an Enigma machine encoding a message is a series of such configurations, each associated with a single character being encoded, a sequence of such representations can be used to represent the operation of the machine as it encodes a message. For example, the process of encoding the first sentence of the main body of the famous \"D\u00f6nitz message\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cryptomuseum.com/crypto/enigma/msg/p1030681.htm|title=Message from D\u00f6nitz&nbsp;\u2014 1 May 1945|access-date=27 November 2018}}</ref> to\n\n RBBF PMHP HGCZ XTDY GAHG UFXG EWKB LKGJ\n\ncan be represented as\n\n 0001 F > KGWNT(R)BLQPAHYDVJIFXEZOCSMU CDTK 25 15 16 26\n 0002 O > UORYTQSLWXZHNM(B)VFCGEAPIJDK CDTL 25 15 16 01\n 0003 L > HLNRSKJAMGF(B)ICUQPDEYOZXWTV CDTM 25 15 16 02\n 0004 G > KPTXIG(F)MESAUHYQBOVJCLRZDNW CDUN 25 15 17 03\n 0005 E > XDYB(P)WOSMUZRIQGENLHVJTFACK CDUO 25 15 17 04\n 0006 N > DLIAJUOVCEXBN(M)GQPWZYFHRKTS CDUP 25 15 17 05\n 0007 D > LUS(H)QOXDMZNAIKFREPCYBWVGTJ CDUQ 25 15 17 06\n 0008 E > JKGO(P)TCIHABRNMDEYLZFXWVUQS CDUR 25 15 17 07\n 0009 S > GCBUZRASYXVMLPQNOF(H)WDKTJIE CDUS 25 15 17 08\n 0010 I > XPJUOWIY(G)CVRTQEBNLZMDKFAHS CDUT 25 15 17 09\n 0011 S > DISAUYOMBPNTHKGJRQ(C)LEZXWFV CDUU 25 15 17 10\n 0012 T > FJLVQAKXNBGCPIRMEOY(Z)WDUHST CDUV 25 15 17 11\n 0013 S > KTJUQONPZCAMLGFHEW(X)BDYRSVI CDUW 25 15 17 12\n 0014 O > ZQXUVGFNWRLKPH(T)MBJYODEICSA CDUX 25 15 17 13\n 0015 F > XJWFR(D)ZSQBLKTVPOIEHMYNCAUG CDUY 25 15 17 14\n 0016 O > FSKTJARXPECNUL(Y)IZGBDMWVHOQ CDUZ 25 15 17 15\n 0017 R > CEAKBMRYUVDNFLTXW(G)ZOIJQPHS CDVA 25 15 18 16\n 0018 T > TLJRVQHGUCXBZYSWFDO(A)IEPKNM CDVB 25 15 18 17\n 0019 B > Y(H)LPGTEBKWICSVUDRQMFONJZAX CDVC 25 15 18 18\n 0020 E > KRUL(G)JEWNFADVIPOYBXZCMHSQT CDVD 25 15 18 19\n 0021 K > RCBPQMVZXY(U)OFSLDEANWKGTIJH CDVE 25 15 18 20\n 0022 A > (F)CBJQAWTVDYNXLUSEZPHOIGMKR CDVF 25 15 18 21\n 0023 N > VFTQSBPORUZWY(X)HGDIECJALNMK CDVG 25 15 18 22\n 0024 N > JSRHFENDUAZYQ(G)XTMCBPIWVOLK CDVH 25 15 18 23\n 0025 T > RCBUTXVZJINQPKWMLAY(E)DGOFSH CDVI 25 15 18 24\n 0026 Z > URFXNCMYLVPIGESKTBOQAJZDH(W) CDVJ 25 15 18 25\n 0027 U > JIOZFEWMBAUSHPCNRQLV(K)TGYXD CDVK 25 15 18 26\n 0028 G > ZGVRKO(B)XLNEIWJFUSDQYPCMHTA CDVL 25 15 18 01\n 0029 E > RMJV(L)YQZKCIEBONUGAWXPDSTFH CDVM 25 15 18 02\n 0030 B > G(K)QRFEANZPBMLHVJCDUXSOYTWI CDWN 25 15 19 03\n 0031 E > YMZT(G)VEKQOHPBSJLIUNDRFXWAC CDWO 25 15 19 04\n 0032 N > PDSBTIUQFNOVW(J)KAHZCEGLMYXR CDWP 25 15 19 05\n\nwhere the letters following each mapping are the letters that appear at the windows at that stage (the only state changes visible to the operator) and the numbers show the underlying physical position of each rotor.\n\nThe character mappings for a given configuration of the machine are in turn the result of a series of such mappings applied by each pass through a component of the machine: the encoding of a character resulting from the application of a given component's mapping serves as the input to the mapping of the subsequent component.  For example, the 4th step in the encoding above can be expanded to show each of these stages using the same representation of mappings and highlighting for the encoded character:\n \n <nowiki>G > ABCDEF(G)HIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\n&nbsp;  P EFMQAB(G)UINKXCJORDPZTHWVLYS &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; AE.BF.CM.DQ.HU.JN.LX.PR.SZ.VW\n&nbsp;  1 OFRJVM(A)ZHQNBXPYKCULGSWETDI&nbsp; N&nbsp; 03&nbsp; VIII\n&nbsp;  2 (N)UKCHVSMDGTZQFYEWPIALOXRJB&nbsp; U&nbsp; 17&nbsp; VI\n&nbsp;  3 XJMIYVCARQOWH(L)NDSUFKGBEPZT&nbsp; D&nbsp; 15&nbsp; V\n&nbsp;  4 QUNGALXEPKZ(Y)RDSOFTVCMBIHWJ&nbsp; C&nbsp; 25&nbsp; \u03b2\n&nbsp;  R RDOBJNTKVEHMLFCWZAXGYIPS(U)Q &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; c\n&nbsp;  4 EVTNHQDXWZJFUCPIAMOR(B)SYGLK &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \u03b2\n&nbsp;  3 H(V)GPWSUMDBTNCOKXJIQZRFLAEY &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; V\n&nbsp;  2 TZDIPNJESYCUHAVRMXGKB(F)QWOL &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; VI\n&nbsp;  1 GLQYW(B)TIZDPSFKANJCUXREVMOH &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; VIII\n&nbsp;  P E(F)MQABGUINKXCJORDPZTHWVLYS &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; AE.BF.CM.DQ.HU.JN.LX.PR.SZ.VW\n F < KPTXIG(F)MESAUHYQBOVJCLRZDNW</nowiki>\n\nHere the encoding begins trivially with the first \"mapping\" representing the keyboard (which has no effect), followed by the plugboard, configured as AE.BF.CM.DQ.HU.JN.LX.PR.SZ.VW which has no effect on 'G', followed by the VIII rotor in the 03 position, which maps G to A, then the VI rotor in the 17 position, which maps A to N, ..., and finally the plugboard again, which maps B to F, producing the overall mapping indicated at the final step: G to F.\n\n== Models ==\nThe Enigma family included multiple designs. The earliest were commercial models dating from the early 1920s. Starting in the mid-1920s, the German military began to use Enigma, making a number of security-related changes.

It measured 65\u00d745\u00d738&nbsp;cm and weighed about {{convert|50|kg|lb}}.\n\n==== Enigma B (1924) ====\nIn 1924 Enigma ''model B'' was introduced, and was of a similar construction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.armyradio.com/publish/Articles/The_Enigma_Code_Breach/Pictures/enigma_type_b.jpg|title=image of Enigma Type B|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051021083422/http://www.armyradio.com/publish/Articles/The_Enigma_Code_Breach/Pictures/enigma_type_b.jpg|archivedate=21 October 2005|df=dmy-all}}</ref> While bearing the Enigma name, both models ''A'' and ''B'' were quite unlike later versions: They differed in physical size and shape, but also cryptographically, in that they lacked the reflector.\n\n==== Enigma C (1926) ====\nThe reflector, suggested by Scherbius' colleague [[Willi Korn]], was introduced in ''Enigma C'' (1926).\n\n''Model C'' was smaller and more portable than its predecessors. It lacked a typewriter, relying on the operator; hence the informal name of \"glowlamp Enigma\" to distinguish it from models ''A'' and ''B''.\n\n==== Enigma D (1927) ====\nThe ''Enigma C'' quickly gave way to ''Enigma D'' (1927). This version was widely used, with shipments to Sweden, the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Japan, Italy, Spain, United States and Poland. In 1927 [[Hugh Foss]] at the British [[Government Communications Headquarters|Government Code and Cypher School]] was able to show that commercial Enigma machines could be broken, provided suitable cribs were available.<ref>Bletchley Park Trust Museum display</ref>\n\n===== \"Navy Cipher D\" =====\nOther countries used Enigma machines. The [[Italian Navy]] adopted the commercial Enigma as \"Navy Cipher D\". The Spanish also used commercial Enigma machines during their [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]]. British codebreakers succeeded in breaking these machines, which lacked a plugboard.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=23}} Enigma machines were also used by diplomatic services.\n\n==== Enigma H (1929) ====\n[[File:Enigma-8-rotor.jpg|right|thumb|upright|A rare 8-rotor printing Enigma model H (1929).]]\nThere was also a large, eight-rotor printing model, the ''Enigma H'', called ''Enigma II'' by the ''[[Reichswehr]]''. In 1933 the Polish Cipher Bureau detected that it was in use for high-level military communication, but it was soon withdrawn, as it was unreliable and jammed frequently.{{sfn|Kozaczuk|1984|p=28}}\n\n==== Enigma K ====\nThe Swiss used a version of Enigma called ''Model K'' or ''Swiss K'' for military and diplomatic use, which was very similar to commercial [[#Enigma D (1927)|Enigma D]]. The machine's code was cracked by Poland, France, the United Kingdom and the United States; the latter code-named it INDIGO. An ''Enigma T'' model, code-named ''Tirpitz'', was used by Japan.\n\n==== Typex ====\nOnce the British figured out Enigma's principle of operation, they fixed the problem with it and created their own, the [[Typex]], which the Germans believed to be unsolvable.<ref>{{YouTube | id=V4V2bpZlqx8 | title=Flaw in the Enigma Code&nbsp;\u2014 Numberphile}}</ref>\n\n=== Military Enigma ===\n==== Funkschl\u00fcssel C ====\nThe Reichsmarine was the first military branch to adopt Enigma. This version, named ''Funkschl\u00fcssel C'' (\"Radio cipher C\"), had been put into production by 1925 and was introduced into service in 1926.{{sfn|Kahn|1991|pp=39\u201341, 299}}\n\nThe keyboard and lampboard contained 29 letters&nbsp;\u2014 A-Z, \u00c4, \u00d6 and \u00dc&nbsp;\u2014 that were arranged alphabetically, as opposed to the QWERTZUI ordering.{{sfn|Ulbricht|2005|p=4}} The rotors had 28 contacts, with the letter ''X'' wired to bypass the rotors unencrypted.{{sfn|Stripp|1993}} Three rotors were chosen from a set of five{{sfn|Kahn|1991|pp=40, 299}} and the reflector could be inserted in one of four different positions, denoted \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 and \u03b4.{{sfn|Bauer|2000|p=108}} The machine was revised slightly in July 1933.{{sfn|Stripp|1993|loc=plate 3}}\n\n==== Enigma G (1928\u20131930) ====\nBy 15 July 1928,{{sfn|Kahn|1991|pp=41, 299}} the German Army (''[[Reichswehr]]'') had introduced their own exclusive version of the Enigma machine, the ''Enigma G''.\n\nThe ''[[Abwehr]]'' used the ''Enigma G'' (the ''Abwehr'' Enigma). This Enigma variant was a four-wheel unsteckered machine with multiple notches on the rotors. This model was equipped with a counter that incremented upon each key press, and so is also known as the \"counter machine\" or the ''Z\u00e4hlwerk'' Enigma.\n\n==== Wehrmacht Enigma I (1930\u20131938) ====\nEnigma machine G was modified to the ''Enigma I'' by June 1930.{{sfn|Kruh|Deavours|2002|p=97}} Enigma I is also known as the ''Wehrmacht'', or \"Services\" Enigma, and was used extensively by German military services and other government organisations (such as the [[Deutsche Reichsbahn#Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (1924-1937)|railways]]{{sfn|Smith|2000|p= 73}}) before and during [[World War II]].\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-769-0229-10A, Frankreich, Guderian, \"Enigma\" cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Heinz Guderian]] in the [[Battle of France]], with an Enigma machine. Note one soldier is keying in text while another writes down the results,]]\nThe major difference between ''Enigma I'' (German Army version from 1930), and commercial Enigma models was the addition of a plugboard to swap pairs of letters, greatly increasing cryptographic strength.\n\nOther differences included the use of a fixed reflector and the relocation of the stepping notches from the rotor body to the movable letter rings. The machine measured {{convert|28|x|34|x|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} and weighed around {{convert|12|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Stripp\">Stripp, 1993</ref>\n\nIn August 1935, the Air Force introduced the Wehrmacht Enigma for their communications.{{sfn|Kruh|Deavours|2002|p=97}}\n\n==== M3 (1934) ====\nBy 1930, the Reichswehr had suggested that the Navy adopt their machine, citing the benefits of increased security (with the plugboard) and easier interservice communications.{{sfn|Kahn|1991|p=43}} The Reichsmarine eventually agreed and in 1934<ref>{{harvnb|Kahn|1991|p=43}} says August 1934. {{harvnb|Kruh|Deavours|2002|p=15}} say October 2004.</ref> brought into service the Navy version of the Army Enigma, designated ''Funkschl\u00fcssel'' ' or ''M3''.

In September, a man identifying himself as \"The Master\" sent a note demanding \u00a325,000 and threatening to destroy the machine if the ransom was not paid. In early October 2000, Bletchley Park officials announced that they would pay the ransom, but the stated deadline passed with no word from the blackmailer. Shortly afterward, the machine was sent anonymously to BBC journalist [[Jeremy Paxman]], missing three rotors.\n\nIn November 2000, an antiques dealer named Dennis Yates was arrested after telephoning ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' to arrange the return of the missing parts. The Enigma machine was returned to Bletchley Park after the incident. In October 2001, Yates was sentenced to ten months in prison and served three months.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1609168.stm|work=BBC News|title=Man jailed over Enigma machine|date=19 October 2001|access-date=2 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2008, the Spanish daily newspaper ''[[El Pa\u00eds]]'' reported that 28 Enigma machines had been discovered by chance in an attic of Army headquarters in Madrid.

The British [[Typex]] was originally derived from the Enigma patents; Typex even includes features from the patent descriptions that were omitted from the actual Enigma machine. The British paid no royalties for the use of the patents, to protect secrecy. The Typex implementation is not the same as that found in German or other Axis versions.\n\nA Japanese Enigma clone was codenamed GREEN by American cryptographers. Little used, it contained four rotors mounted vertically. In the United States, cryptologist [[William F. Friedman|William Friedman]] designed the [[M-325]], a machine logically similar, although not in construction.\n\nA unique rotor machine was constructed in 2002 by Netherlands-based Tatjana van Vark. This device makes use of 40-point rotors, allowing letters, numbers and some punctuation to be used; each rotor contains 509 parts.<ref>van Vark, Tatjana ''[http://www.tatjavanvark.nl/tvv1/pht10.html The coding machine]''</ref>\n\nMachines like the [[SIGABA]], [[NEMA (machine)|NEMA]], [[Typex]] and so forth, are deliberately not considered to be Enigma derivatives as their internal ciphering functions are not mathematically identical to the Enigma transform.\n\nSeveral software implementations exist, but not all exactly match Enigma behaviour. The most commonly used software derivative (that is not compliant with any hardware implementation of the Enigma) is at EnigmaCo.de. Many Java applet Enigmas only accept single letter entry, complicating use even if the applet is Enigma compliant. Technically, Enigma@home is the largest scale deployment of a software Enigma, but the decoding software does not implement encipherment making it a derivative (as all original machines could cipher and decipher).\n\nA user-friendly three-rotor simulator, where users can select rotors, use the plugboard and define new settings for the rotors and reflectors is available.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://w1tp.com/enigma/enigma_w.zip|title=3 rotor download}}</ref> The output appears in separate windows which can be independently made \"invisible\" to hide decryption.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://membres.multimania.fr/pc1/enigma/ |title=Enigma at Multimania |access-date=2 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402015246/http://membres.multimania.fr/pc1/enigma/ |archive-date=2 April 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Another includes an \"autotyping\" function which takes plaintext from a clipboard and converts it to cyphertext (or vice versa) at one of four speeds.

Turing was played by [[Derek Jacobi]], who also played Turing in a 1996 television adaptation of the play.\n* [[Robert Harris (novelist)|Robert Harris]]' novel ''[[Enigma (novel)|Enigma]]'' (1995) is set against the backdrop of World War II [[Bletchley Park]] and cryptologists working to read Naval Enigma in [[Hut 8]].\n* [[Neal Stephenson]]'s novel ''[[Cryptonomicon]]'' (1999) prominently features the Enigma machine and efforts to break it, and portrays the German U-boat command under [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]] using it in apparently deliberate ignorance of its penetration.\n* Enigma is featured in ''[[The Code Book]]'', a survey of the history of cryptography written by [[Simon Singh]] and published in 1999.\n* The Enigma machine is used as a key plot element in [[Century Rain]] by [[Alastair Reynolds]], set in an alternate Earth where technological research has stagnated and the Enigma is the highest level of encryption available both to civilians and military.\n\n; Films\n* ''[[Sekret Enigmy]]'' (1979; translation: ''The Enigma Secret''), is a Polish film dealing with Polish aspects of the subject.<ref>{{IMDb title|tt0079878}}</ref>\n* The plot of the film ''[[U-571 (film)|U-571]]'' (released in 2000) revolves around an attempt by American, rather than British, forces to seize an Enigma machine from a German U-boat.\n* The 2001 war comedy film ''[[All the Queen's Men]]'' featured a fictitious British plot to capture an Engima machine by infiltrating the Enigma factory with men disguised as women.\n* Harris' book, with substantial changes in plot, was adapted as the film ''[[Enigma (2001 film)|Enigma]]'' (2001), directed by [[Michael Apted]] and starring [[Kate Winslet]] and [[Dougray Scott]]. The film was criticised for historical inaccuracies, including neglect of the role of [[Poland]]'s ''[[Biuro Szyfr\u00f3w]]''. The film, like the book, makes a Pole the villain, who seeks to betray the secret of Enigma decryption.<ref>{{cite news |author=Laurence Peter|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8158782.stm |title=How Poles cracked Nazi Enigma secret |work=[[BBC News]]|date= 20 July 2009}}</ref>\n* The film ''[[The Imitation Game]]'' (2014) tells the story of [[Alan Turing]] and his attempts to crack the Enigma machine code during World War II.<ref name=ng />\n\n; Television\n* In the British television series ''[[The Bletchley Circle]]'', the [[Typex]] was used by the protagonists during the war, and in Season 2, Episode 4, they visit [[Bletchley Park]] to seek one out, in order to crack the code of the [[black market]] procurer and smuggler Marta, who used the Typex to encode her ledger. The Circle, forced to settle for using an Enigma, instead, successfully cracks the code.\n* In [[Elementary (TV series)|Elementary]] [[List of Elementary episodes#Season 5 (2016\u201317)|season 5, episode 23]] (\"Scrambled\"), a drug smuggling gang uses a four-rotor Enigma machine as part of their effort to encrypt their communications.\n*In [[Bones (TV series)|Bones]] [[Bones (season 8)|season 8, episode 12]] (\"The Corpse in the Canopy\"), [[Jack Hodgins (Bones)|Dr. Jack Hodgins]] uses an Enigma machine to send information to [[Seeley Booth]] at the FBI in order to prevent [[List of Bones characters#Christopher Pelant|Christopher Pelant]], a master hacker, from spying on their communications.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Ultra]]\n* [[Bletchley Park]]\n* [[Beaumanor Hall]], a stately home used during the Second World War for military intelligence\n* [[Joan Clarke]]\n* [[Erich Fellgiebel]]\n* [[Gisbert Hasenjaeger]]&nbsp;\u2014 responsible for Enigma security\n* [[Fritz Thiele]]\n* [[United States Naval Computing Machine Laboratory]]\n* [[Arlington Hall]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book|last=Bauer |first=F.

This [[cDNA|copied DNA]] is then inserted back into the genome at a new position. The reverse transcription step is catalyzed by a [[reverse transcriptase]], which is often encoded by the TE itself. The characteristics of retrotransposons are similar to [[retrovirus]]es, such as [[HIV]].\n\nRetrotransposons are commonly grouped into three main orders:\n* Retrotransposons, with [[long terminal repeat]]s (LTRs), which encode reverse transcriptase, similar to retroviruses\n* Retroposons, [[LINEs|long interspersed nuclear elements]] (LINEs, LINE-1s, or L1s), which encode reverse transcriptase but lack LTRs, and are transcribed by [[RNA polymerase II]]\n* [[Short interspersed nuclear element]]s (SINEs) do not encode reverse transcriptase and are transcribed by [[RNA polymerase III]]\n\n(Retroviruses can also be considered TEs. For example, after conversion of retroviral RNA into DNA inside a host cell, the newly produced retroviral DNA is integrated into the [[genome]] of the host cell. These integrated DNAs are termed ''[[provirus]]es''. The provirus is a specialized form of [[eukaryotic]] retrotransposon, which can produce RNA intermediates that may leave the host cell and infect other cells. The transposition cycle of retroviruses has similarities to that of [[prokaryotic]] TEs, suggesting a distant relationship between the two.)\n\n=== DNA transposons ===\n[[File:DNA Transposon.png|thumb|upright=1.4|'''A'''. Structure of DNA transposons (Mariner type). Two inverted tandem repeats (TIR) flank the transposase gene. Two short tandem site duplications (TSD) are present on both sides of the insert.<br />\n'''B'''.

The transpositions are catalyzed by several [[transposase]] enzymes. Some transposases non-specifically bind to any target site in DNA, whereas others bind to specific target sequences. The transposase makes a staggered cut at the target site producing [[sticky ends]], cuts out the DNA transposon and ligates it into the target site. A [[DNA polymerase]] fills in the resulting gaps from the sticky ends and [[DNA ligase]] closes the sugar-phosphate backbone. This results in target site duplication and the insertion sites of DNA transposons may be identified by short direct repeats (a staggered cut in the target DNA filled by DNA polymerase) followed by inverted repeats (which are important for the TE excision by transposase).\n\nCut-and-paste TEs may be duplicated if their transposition takes place during [[S phase]] of the [[cell cycle]], when a donor site has already been replicated but a target site has not yet been replicated.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Young |display-authors=et al |title=Review of techniques and methods in replication and hybridization of transposable elements in vitro |journal=Journal of Biomolecular Technology |date=2012 |volume=19 |issue=18 |pages=341\u2013357}}</ref> Such duplications at the target site can result in [[gene duplication]], which plays an important role in genomic [[evolution]].<ref name=\"Brock\">{{cite book |veditors=Madigan M, Martinko J |title=Brock Biolog of Microorganisms |edition=11th |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-13-144329-7}}</ref>{{rp|284}}\n\nNot all DNA transposons transpose through the cut-and-paste mechanism. In some cases, a [[replicative transposition]] is observed in which a transposon replicates itself to a new target site (e.g. [[helitron (biology)|helitron]]).\n\nClass II TEs comprise less than 2% of the human genome, making the rest Class I.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kazazian HH, Moran JV | title = The impact of L1 retrotransposons on the human genome | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 19\u201324 | date = May 1998 | pmid = 9590283 | doi = 10.1038/ng0598-19 }}</ref>\n\n=== Autonomous and non-autonomous ===\nTransposition can be classified as either \"autonomous\" or \"non-autonomous\" in both Class I and Class II TEs. Autonomous TEs can move by themselves, whereas non-autonomous TEs require the presence of another TE to move. This is often because dependent TEs lack transposase (for Class II) or reverse transcriptase (for Class I).\n\nActivator element (''Ac'') is an example of an autonomous TE, and dissociation elements (''Ds'') is an example of a non-autonomous TE. Without ''Ac,'' ''Ds'' is not able to transpose.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n* The first TEs were discovered in [[maize]] (''Zea mays'') by [[Barbara McClintock]] in 1948, for which she was later awarded a [[Nobel Prize]]. She noticed chromosomal [[Genetic insertion|insertions]], [[Genetic deletion|deletions]], and [[Chromosomal translocation|translocations]] caused by these elements. These changes in the genome could, for example, lead to a change in the color of corn kernels. About 85% of the maize genome consists of TEs.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Schnable PS, Ware D, Fulton RS, Stein JC, Wei F, Pasternak S, Liang C, Zhang J, Fulton L, Graves TA, Minx P, Reily AD, Courtney L, Kruchowski SS, Tomlinson C, Strong C, Delehaunty K, Fronick C, Courtney B, Rock SM, Belter E, Du F, Kim K, Abbott RM, Cotton M, Levy A, Marchetto P, Ochoa K, Jackson SM, Gillam B, Chen W, Yan L, Higginbotham J, Cardenas M, Waligorski J, Applebaum E, Phelps L, Falcone J, Kanchi K, Thane T, Scimone A, Thane N, Henke J, Wang T, Ruppert J, Shah N, Rotter K, Hodges J, Ingenthron E, Cordes M, Kohlberg S, Sgro J, Delgado B, Mead K, Chinwalla A, Leonard S, Crouse K, Collura K, Kudrna D, Currie J, He R, Angelova A, Rajasekar S, Mueller T, Lomeli R, Scara G, Ko A, Delaney K, Wissotski M, Lopez G, Campos D, Braidotti M, Ashley E, Golser W, Kim H, Lee S, Lin J, Dujmic Z, Kim W, Talag J, Zuccolo A, Fan C, Sebastian A, Kramer M, Spiegel L, Nascimento L, Zutavern T, Miller B, Ambroise C, Muller S, Spooner W, Narechania A, Ren L, Wei S, Kumari S, Faga B, Levy MJ, McMahan L, Van Buren P, Vaughn MW, Ying K, Yeh CT, Emrich SJ, Jia Y, Kalyanaraman A, Hsia AP, Barbazuk WB, Baucom RS, Brutnell TP, Carpita NC, Chaparro C, Chia JM, Deragon JM, Estill JC, Fu Y, Jeddeloh JA, Han Y, Lee H, Li P, Lisch DR, Liu S, Liu Z, Nagel DH, McCann MC, SanMiguel P, Myers AM, Nettleton D, Nguyen J, Penning BW, Ponnala L, Schneider KL, Schwartz DC, Sharma A, Soderlund C, Springer NM, Sun Q, Wang H, Waterman M, Westerman R, Wolfgruber TK, Yang L, Yu Y, Zhang L, Zhou S, Zhu Q, Bennetzen JL, Dawe RK, Jiang J, Jiang N, Presting GG, Wessler SR, Aluru S, Martienssen RA, Clifton SW, McCombie WR, Wing RA, Wilson RK | display-authors = 6 | title = The B73 maize genome: complexity, diversity, and dynamics | journal = Science | volume = 326 | issue = 5956 | pages = 1112\u20135 | date = November 2009 | pmid = 19965430 | doi = 10.1126/science.1178534 | bibcode = 2009Sci...326.1112S | url = https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1206&context=stat_las_pubs }}</ref> The [[Ac/Ds Activator/Dissociation Transposable Element|Ac/Ds]] system described by McClintock are Class II TEs.

[[Interspersed repeat]]s within genomes are created by transposition events accumulating over evolutionary time.

TEs may also have been co-opted by the [[Adaptive immune system|vertebrate immune system]] as a means of producing antibody diversity. The [[V(D)J recombination]] system operates by a mechanism similar to that of some TEs.\n\nTEs can contain many types of genes, including those conferring antibiotic resistance and ability to transpose to conjugative plasmids.

Likewise, the first TE to be molecularly isolated was from a plant ([[Antirrhinum|snapdragon]]). Appropriately, TEs have been an especially useful tool in plant molecular biology. Researchers use them as a means of mutagenesis. In this context, a TE jumps into a gene and produces a mutation. The presence of such a TE provides a straightforward means of identifying the mutant allele relative to chemical mutagenesis methods.\n\nSometimes the insertion of a TE into a gene can disrupt that gene's function in a reversible manner, in a process called [[insertional mutagenesis]]; transposase-mediated excision of the DNA transposon restores gene function. This produces plants in which neighboring cells have different [[genotype]]s. This feature allows researchers to distinguish between genes that must be present inside of a cell in order to function (cell-autonomous) and genes that produce observable effects in cells other than those where the gene is expressed.\n\nTEs are also a widely used tool for mutagenesis of most experimentally tractable organisms.

There are three groups of algorithms for the first step. One group is referred to as the [[k-mer]] approach, where a k-mer is a sequence of length k. In this approach, the genome is scanned for overrepresented k-mers; that is, k-mers that occur more often than is likely based on probability alone. The length k is determined by the type of transposon being searched for. The k-mer approach also allows mismatches, the number of which is determined by the analyst. Some k-mer approach programs use the k-mer as a base, and extend both ends of each repeated k-mer until there is no more similarity between them, indicating the ends of the repeats.<ref name=\"Wojciech Maka\u0142owski p. 337-359\"/> Another group of algorithms employs a method called sequence self-comparison. Sequence self-comparison programs use databases such as [[BLAST|AB-BLAST]] to conduct an initial [[sequence alignment]]. As these programs find groups of elements that partially overlap, they are useful for finding highly diverged transposons, or transposons with only a small region copied into other parts of the genome.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Saha S, Bridges S, Magbanua ZV, Peterson DG | title = Empirical comparison of ab initio repeat finding programs | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 36 | issue = 7 | pages = 2284\u201394 | date = April 2008 | pmid = 18287116 | pmc = 2367713 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkn064 }}</ref> Another group of algorithms follows the periodicity approach. These algorithms perform a [[Fourier transformation]] on the sequence data, identifying periodicities, regions that are repeated periodically, and are able to use peaks in the resultant spectrum to find candidate repetitive elements. This method works best for tandem repeats, but can be used for dispersed repeats as well. However, it is a slow process, making it an unlikely choice for genome scale analysis.<ref name=\"Wojciech Maka\u0142owski p. 337-359\"/>\n\nThe second step of ''de novo'' repeat identification involves building a consensus of each family of sequences. A [[consensus sequence]] is a sequence that is created based on the repeats that comprise a TE family. A base pair in a consensus is the one that occurred most often in the sequences being compared to make the consensus. For example, in a family of 50 repeats where 42 have a T base pair in the same position, the consensus sequence would have a T at this position as well, as the base pair is representative of the family as a whole at that particular position, and is most likely the base pair found in the family's ancestor at that position.<ref name=\"Wojciech Maka\u0142owski p. 337-359\"/> Once a consensus sequence has been made for each family, it is then possible to move on to further analysis, such as TE classification and genome masking in order to quantify the overall TE content of the genome.\n\n== Adaptive TEs ==\n\nTransposable elements have been recognized as good candidates for stimulating gene adaptation, through their ability to regulate the expression levels of nearby genes.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mari\u00f1o-Ram\u00edrez L, Lewis KC, Landsman D, Jordan IK | title = Transposable elements donate lineage-specific regulatory sequences to host genomes | journal = Cytogenetic and Genome Research | volume = 110 | issue = 1\u20134 | pages = 333\u201341 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16093685 | pmc = 1803082 | doi = 10.1159/000084965 | lastauthoramp = y }}</ref> Combined with their \"mobility\", transposable elements can be relocated adjacent to their targeted genes, and control the expression levels of the gene, dependent upon the circumstances.\n\nThe study conducted in 2008, \"High Rate of Recent Transposable Element\u2013Induced Adaptation in Drosophila melanogaster\", used ''D. melanogaster'' that had recently migrated from Africa to other parts of the world, as a basis for studying adaptations caused by transposable elements.

This [[cDNA|copied DNA]] is then inserted back into the genome at a new position. The reverse transcription step is catalyzed by a [[reverse transcriptase]], which is often encoded by the TE itself. The characteristics of retrotransposons are similar to [[retrovirus]]es, such as [[HIV]].\n\nRetrotransposons are commonly grouped into three main orders:\n* Retrotransposons, with [[long terminal repeat]]s (LTRs), which encode reverse transcriptase, similar to retroviruses\n* Retroposons, [[LINEs|long interspersed nuclear elements]] (LINEs, LINE-1s, or L1s), which encode reverse transcriptase but lack LTRs, and are transcribed by [[RNA polymerase II]]\n* [[Short interspersed nuclear element]]s (SINEs) do not encode reverse transcriptase and are transcribed by [[RNA polymerase III]]\n\n(Retroviruses can also be considered TEs. For example, after conversion of retroviral RNA into DNA inside a host cell, the newly produced retroviral DNA is integrated into the [[genome]] of the host cell. These integrated DNAs are termed ''[[provirus]]es''. The provirus is a specialized form of [[eukaryotic]] retrotransposon, which can produce RNA intermediates that may leave the host cell and infect other cells. The transposition cycle of retroviruses has similarities to that of [[prokaryotic]] TEs, suggesting a distant relationship between the two.)\n\n=== DNA transposons ===\n[[File:DNA Transposon.png|thumb|upright=1.4|'''A'''.

Two short tandem site duplications (TSD) are present on both sides of the insert.<br />\n'''B'''.

The transpositions are catalyzed by several [[transposase]] enzymes. Some transposases non-specifically bind to any target site in DNA, whereas others bind to specific target sequences. The transposase makes a staggered cut at the target site producing [[sticky ends]], cuts out the DNA transposon and ligates it into the target site. A [[DNA polymerase]] fills in the resulting gaps from the sticky ends and [[DNA ligase]] closes the sugar-phosphate backbone. This results in target site duplication and the insertion sites of DNA transposons may be identified by short direct repeats (a staggered cut in the target DNA filled by DNA polymerase) followed by inverted repeats (which are important for the TE excision by transposase).\n\nCut-and-paste TEs may be duplicated if their transposition takes place during [[S phase]] of the [[cell cycle]], when a donor site has already been replicated but a target site has not yet been replicated.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Young |display-authors=et al |title=Review of techniques and methods in replication and hybridization of transposable elements in vitro |journal=Journal of Biomolecular Technology |date=2012 |volume=19 |issue=18 |pages=341\u2013357}}</ref> Such duplications at the target site can result in [[gene duplication]], which plays an important role in genomic [[evolution]].<ref name=\"Brock\">{{cite book |veditors=Madigan M, Martinko J |title=Brock Biolog of Microorganisms |edition=11th |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-13-144329-7}}</ref>{{rp|284}}\n\nNot all DNA transposons transpose through the cut-and-paste mechanism. In some cases, a [[replicative transposition]] is observed in which a transposon replicates itself to a new target site (e.g. [[helitron (biology)|helitron]]).\n\nClass II TEs comprise less than 2% of the human genome, making the rest Class I.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kazazian HH, Moran JV | title = The impact of L1 retrotransposons on the human genome | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 19\u201324 | date = May 1998 | pmid = 9590283 | doi = 10.1038/ng0598-19 }}</ref>\n\n=== Autonomous and non-autonomous ===\nTransposition can be classified as either \"autonomous\" or \"non-autonomous\" in both Class I and Class II TEs. Autonomous TEs can move by themselves, whereas non-autonomous TEs require the presence of another TE to move. This is often because dependent TEs lack transposase (for Class II) or reverse transcriptase (for Class I).\n\nActivator element (''Ac'') is an example of an autonomous TE, and dissociation elements (''Ds'') is an example of a non-autonomous TE. Without ''Ac,'' ''Ds'' is not able to transpose.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n* The first TEs were discovered in [[maize]] (''Zea mays'') by [[Barbara McClintock]] in 1948, for which she was later awarded a [[Nobel Prize]]. She noticed chromosomal [[Genetic insertion|insertions]], [[Genetic deletion|deletions]], and [[Chromosomal translocation|translocations]] caused by these elements. These changes in the genome could, for example, lead to a change in the color of corn kernels.

[[Interspersed repeat]]s within genomes are created by transposition events accumulating over evolutionary time.

TEs may also have been co-opted by the [[Adaptive immune system|vertebrate immune system]] as a means of producing antibody diversity. The [[V(D)J recombination]] system operates by a mechanism similar to that of some TEs.\n\nTEs can contain many types of genes, including those conferring antibiotic resistance and ability to transpose to conjugative plasmids.

Likewise, the first TE to be molecularly isolated was from a plant ([[Antirrhinum|snapdragon]]). Appropriately, TEs have been an especially useful tool in plant molecular biology. Researchers use them as a means of mutagenesis. In this context, a TE jumps into a gene and produces a mutation. The presence of such a TE provides a straightforward means of identifying the mutant allele relative to chemical mutagenesis methods.\n\nSometimes the insertion of a TE into a gene can disrupt that gene's function in a reversible manner, in a process called [[insertional mutagenesis]]; transposase-mediated excision of the DNA transposon restores gene function. This produces plants in which neighboring cells have different [[genotype]]s. This feature allows researchers to distinguish between genes that must be present inside of a cell in order to function (cell-autonomous) and genes that produce observable effects in cells other than those where the gene is expressed.\n\nTEs are also a widely used tool for mutagenesis of most experimentally tractable organisms.

There are three groups of algorithms for the first step. One group is referred to as the [[k-mer]] approach, where a k-mer is a sequence of length k. In this approach, the genome is scanned for overrepresented k-mers; that is, k-mers that occur more often than is likely based on probability alone. The length k is determined by the type of transposon being searched for. The k-mer approach also allows mismatches, the number of which is determined by the analyst. Some k-mer approach programs use the k-mer as a base, and extend both ends of each repeated k-mer until there is no more similarity between them, indicating the ends of the repeats.<ref name=\"Wojciech Maka\u0142owski p. 337-359\"/> Another group of algorithms employs a method called sequence self-comparison. Sequence self-comparison programs use databases such as [[BLAST|AB-BLAST]] to conduct an initial [[sequence alignment]]. As these programs find groups of elements that partially overlap, they are useful for finding highly diverged transposons, or transposons with only a small region copied into other parts of the genome.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Saha S, Bridges S, Magbanua ZV, Peterson DG | title = Empirical comparison of ab initio repeat finding programs | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 36 | issue = 7 | pages = 2284\u201394 | date = April 2008 | pmid = 18287116 | pmc = 2367713 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkn064 }}</ref> Another group of algorithms follows the periodicity approach. These algorithms perform a [[Fourier transformation]] on the sequence data, identifying periodicities, regions that are repeated periodically, and are able to use peaks in the resultant spectrum to find candidate repetitive elements. This method works best for tandem repeats, but can be used for dispersed repeats as well. However, it is a slow process, making it an unlikely choice for genome scale analysis.<ref name=\"Wojciech Maka\u0142owski p. 337-359\"/>\n\nThe second step of ''de novo'' repeat identification involves building a consensus of each family of sequences. A [[consensus sequence]] is a sequence that is created based on the repeats that comprise a TE family. A base pair in a consensus is the one that occurred most often in the sequences being compared to make the consensus. For example, in a family of 50 repeats where 42 have a T base pair in the same position, the consensus sequence would have a T at this position as well, as the base pair is representative of the family as a whole at that particular position, and is most likely the base pair found in the family's ancestor at that position.<ref name=\"Wojciech Maka\u0142owski p. 337-359\"/> Once a consensus sequence has been made for each family, it is then possible to move on to further analysis, such as TE classification and genome masking in order to quantify the overall TE content of the genome.\n\n== Adaptive TEs ==\n\nTransposable elements have been recognized as good candidates for stimulating gene adaptation, through their ability to regulate the expression levels of nearby genes.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mari\u00f1o-Ram\u00edrez L, Lewis KC, Landsman D, Jordan IK | title = Transposable elements donate lineage-specific regulatory sequences to host genomes | journal = Cytogenetic and Genome Research | volume = 110 | issue = 1\u20134 | pages = 333\u201341 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16093685 | pmc = 1803082 | doi = 10.1159/000084965 | lastauthoramp = y }}</ref> Combined with their \"mobility\", transposable elements can be relocated adjacent to their targeted genes, and control the expression levels of the gene, dependent upon the circumstances.\n\nThe study conducted in 2008, \"High Rate of Recent Transposable Element\u2013Induced Adaptation in Drosophila melanogaster\", used ''D. melanogaster'' that had recently migrated from Africa to other parts of the world, as a basis for studying adaptations caused by transposable elements.

It shared the [[front-wheel drive]] [[GM A platform (FWD)|A platform]] with the similar [[Buick Century]], [[Pontiac 6000]] and [[Chevrolet Celebrity]]; both Oldsmobile and [[Chevrolet]] considered using the Celebrity name, which had originally been used on the [[Oldsmobile 88|Eighty Eight]] model in the 1960s.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Witzenburg |first=Gary |title=The Name Game |journal=Motor Trend |date=April 1984 |page=82}}</ref> Available body styles included a 2-door [[coupe]], 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]], and the '''Cutlass (Ciera) Cruiser''' [[station wagon]]. Based on the [[GM X platform (1980)|GM X-Body]], this platform served as the basis for the [[GM U platform|GM U-Body]] vans.\n\n==Development==\nThe 1980s was a time of great transition for General Motors. [[Roger Smith (executive)|CEO Roger B. Smith]] invested heavily in computerization, front wheel drive and advanced assembly processes. One of the first products to reach the marketplace under this program was the GM A-Body. The Cutlass Ciera, like its A-Body platform mates, benefited from GM's Computer Command Control system, MacPherson strut front suspension, body color urethane bumpers, flush mounted glass, front wheel drive and on many models, fuel injection. The Cutlass Ciera shared the [[Oldsmobile Cutlass|Cutlass]] nameplate with the smaller [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Calais|Cutlass Calais]] and the larger [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme|Cutlass Supreme]], often creating confusion among the buying public as all three were available concurrently during the late 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nInitially, the Cutlass Ciera and its platform mates were premium mid sized offerings, holding a higher market position than the X-Body, from which they were derived, and the [[GM N platform|N-Body]] Calais, which would follow for 1985. The Cutlass Ciera and Cruiser were intended as replacements for the venerable rear wheel drive G-Body Cutlass models, but strong sales kept the higher trim Cutlass Supreme in production until the 1988 model year, when it was replaced by the all new GM W-Body models. As such, these front wheel drive sedans carried the A-Body designation, previously reserved for their rear wheel drive showroom companions. In order to keep both lines in production, General Motors rechristened the rear wheel drive mid sized platform as the [[GM G platform|G-Body]] beginning with the 1982 model year. When the W-Body intermediates were introduced for 1988, Oldsmobile \"decontented\" its Cutlass Ciera by reducing the number of options and configurations available to the public. During the model years that followed, luxury and performance options such as FE3 suspension, Auto Calculator, bucket seats, leather seating areas, sunroofs, and full instrumentation were eliminated.  After 1990, special editions were dropped from the American market and by the end of 1991, the coupe was discontinued. Although slimmed down to just two trim levels and two body styles, sedan and wagon, the 1996 final run of Oldsmobile Cieras were still Oldsmobile's best selling product line.\n\n==Special editions==\nThe car enjoyed many factory specialty models including the Holiday Coupe, GT, ES, XC, and International Series models \u2013 the latter of which had a stock body kit.\n\n'''Holiday Coupe'''\n[[File:1985 Cutlass Ciera Holiday Coupe.jpg|thumb|1985 Cutlass Ciera Holiday coupe (RPO WJ5) in Pastel Beige with Saddle top and interior.]]\nFrom 1984 to March 1986, Oldsmobile offered a special edition Holiday Coupe package, option WJ5, on the Brougham coupe. This package included a unique landau vinyl roof (RPO C10), opera windows, special rooftop trim and painted pin stripes. The Holiday Coupe package required tinted glass and could not be ordered with standard pin stripes. It was discontinued part way through the 1986 model year, when Oldsmobile introduced the updated coupe roof line. All Holiday coupes were converted by the American Sunroof Company (ASC) outside of the factory. Oldsmobile would ship ASC Brougham coupes equipped with tinted glass to modify at their facility. These models have an ASC decal in the driver side door frame indicating the factory authorized conversion.\n\n'''ES'''\nThe ES (RPO W48) sedan was available from 1983\u20131985. These vehicles feature unique wheel covers, blacked out trim, F41 performance suspension, black sidewall tires, center console with bucket seats and a sport steering wheel. For 1985 only the ES sedan returned, as the coupe had been renamed GT.\n\n'''GT'''\nThe GT (RPO W45) was first offered as an option on the 1985 Ciera coupe.<ref>http://blog.consumerguide.com/cheap-wheels-1986-90-oldsmobile-cutlass-ciera-gtinternational-series-coupe/</ref> It featured blacked out trim, V6 engine, center console with bucket seats, fog lamps factory body kit, alloy wheels and performance suspension. For 1986, it was expanded to the four door sedan, replacing the ES. Following the 1987 model year, it was replaced by the International Series.\n\n'''International Series'''\nFrom 1988 to 1990, the International Series (RPO W45/W49) was the top performance trim available on the Ciera. It featured the 3.8 liter V6 for 1988 and the 3.3 liter V6 for 1989 and 1990. Available on coupe and sedan models, it featured a factory body kit, bucket seats with console, FE3 performance suspension, alloy wheels, full instrumentation, air conditioning JA2 heavy duty brakes, extra capacity cooling, and unique ornamentation.<ref>http://blog.consumerguide.com/cheap-wheels-1986-90-oldsmobile-cutlass-ciera-gtinternational-series-coupe/</ref>\n\n'''XC''' The XC was introduced as part of Oldsmobile's 90th Anniversary celebrations (XC being Roman Numeral or 90) and remained on the option sheet from 1988 to 1990.<ref>https://sites.google.com/view/cutlasscieraresourcecenter/home/1988</ref> It was available on coupe and sedan models. Sharing much of its sporty appearance with the International Series, the XC is distinguished by orange body side stripes in place of the typical black and chrome trim. Unlike the similar looking International Series, the XC package did not include a standard V6, 4 speed automatic, or other higher end features. These had to be ordered in addition to the XC package.\n\nOldsmobile never produced a factory convertible of this A-Body model for public sale, but many dealers did make them available via aftermarket conversions. Between 1983 and 1986, 814 Cutlass Ciera convertibles were made by [[Hess & Eisenhardt|Hess & Eisenhardt/Car Craft]].<ref>https://www.hemmings.com/blog/article/everyday-cutlass-ciera/</ref> These vehicles were Brougham coupes, modified with leather interior and chassis reinforcement to provide the needed structural rigidity that was lost by removing the roof.\n\n==1982\u20131988==\n[[File:Early Olds Cutlass Ciera.jpg|thumb|left|1982\u20131984 Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera sedan]]\nProduction began September 28, 1981 at [[Doraville Assembly]] in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] for the 1982 model year.<ref name='Wards82'>{{cite book |title=Ward's Automotive Yearbook 1982 |publisher=Ward's Communications |year=1982}}</ref>  In 1984, the Cutlass Cruiser [[station wagon]] model moved to the Cutlass Ciera's platform; previously, the nameplate used the [[rear wheel drive]] [[GM G platform (RWD)|G-body]]. The Cutlass Ciera came in three trim levels: the base, LS, and ''Brougham'' {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|b|r|o\u02d0|\u0259|m}}.\n\nThe standard engine was a 2.5 L four-cylinder Tech IV ([[Iron Duke engine|Pontiac Iron Duke]]) engine. All models also included standard bench seats and cloth interior.  Available on all models were a 3.0 L Buick V6 engine, or a 4.3 L Oldsmobile Diesel V6 engine. Brougham trim added a  plush interior with vinyl accents, leatherette interior door pulls, additional chrome trim and a reading lamp. The base coupe and sedan were initially dropped after 1982 due to poor sales, leaving LS and Brougham trim as the only available from 1983\u20131985, excluding special editions. During the model year, production ended at the [[Fremont Assembly|Fremont GM Assembly Plant]] due to that facility closing.\n\n1983 Added a new ES trim package for the coupe and sedan models. This would be the last year for the standard 13\" wheels.\n\nFor the 1984, the line added a new Cruiser wagon, replacing the former G-Body Cutlass Cruiser. A 3.8 liter Buick V6 and the Holiday Coupe package joined the option list<ref>https://sites.google.com/view/cutlasscieraresourcecenter/home/1984</ref> as did a 4 speed manual transmission for diesel models. This transmission was dropped in the fall of 1983 from the option list.\n\nFor 1985, the Cutlass Ciera received its first facelift with revised grille, headlamps, taillights and interiors. The GT coupe was added as a companion to the ES sedan. In spring 1985 the Oldsmobile designed 4.3-liter diesel was dropped due to poor sales. Canadian models added the 2.8 liter 2bbl V6 to this year.\n\nFor 1986, the Cutlass Ciera's grille had expanded ventilation sections than the similar 1985 model. The coupe received a new, more rounded roofline that was not initially shared with the other GM A-body models, but later migrated to the Buick Century coupe. These models are easily identifiable by their sweeping roofline and updated VIN identification, which replaced the \"27\" coupe designation used form 1982 until March 1986 with \"37\". 1986 also saw the addition of the 2.8 liter V6 in place of the previously offered Buick 3.0 liter V6 in the American market. The 2.8 liter engine had previously been offered in Canadian Ciera's with the 2-barrel carburetor.  In compliance with federal regulations, the 1986 Ciera was the first to have a high mount brake light as standard equipment. The Cutlass Ciera nameplate appeared on the rear fiberglass panel, just below the trunk lid.\n\n[[File:1985 Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera Brougham Convertible (H&E), front left at Hershey 2019.jpg|thumb|1985 Cutlass Ciera Convertible conversion by Hess & Eisenhardt]]\nFor 1987, the Cutlass Ciera was facelifted again with a new grille, updated steering wheel had the Oldsmobile logo moved from the right to the very center, and the 2.8 L ''LE2'' V6 engine was dropped in favor of the more powerful LB6 unit. In addition, Brougham and GT models received composite headlamps as standard equipment. The 2.5 liter Iron Duke 4 cylinder received minor updates, including a serpentine belt, which replaced the previous engine belt set up, for a boost of 6 horsepower, to 98.  Ciera's tail lamps were slightly revised, adding ribs to their lower quarter.\n\nFor 1988, the base Cutlass Ciera received composite headlamps, the new ''International Series'' models were introduced, and this would be the last year for the ''Brougham'', which was rechristened the Brougham SL on coupe models. The ''International Series'' included the emblem with the flags of various countries below the nameplate (see below for exemplar) and was available on coupe and sedan body styles. This model came equipped with a standard Buick 3.8 liter V6 engine, 4-speed automatic transmission, sporty exhaust system, front bucket seats, and power windows. Composite headlamps were made standard on all Cutlass Ciera models. Sedan models could have the new power sliding sunroof for the first time.<ref>https://sites.google.com/view/cutlasscieraresourcecenter/home/1988</ref>\n\n===Engines===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

Rear seat shoulder belts were added. Both coupe and sedan models received updated rear-end treatments. The older Buick 3.8 liter V6 was dropped in favor of GM's new [[GM 3300 engine|3300 V6]] engine. The Brougham trim level was eliminated, replaced by an upper level SL trim. A new XC wagon also joined the option sheet this year.<ref>https://sites.google.com/view/cutlasscieraresourcecenter/home/1989</ref>\n\nFor 1990, the front seat belts were moved from the B-pillars to the doors. This would also be the last year for the 'International Series' and 'XC'.\n\nThe changes for 1991 included a new instrument cluster with a trip odometer and an engine temperature gauge. 6 speaker sound systems were added as was a remote lock fob and improved body acoustics. This would be the last year for the coupe in the United States and Canada, but it would continue on in the Mexican market.\n\nFor 1992, the coupe was dropped, and the line-up included only sedans and wagons in 'S' or 'SL' designations. The wagon now had some internal competition in the form of the new [[Oldsmobile Silhouette]] minivan (itself based on the Cutlass Ciera's A-platform), offering buyers a choice of traditional station wagon or a multi-configurable minivan. Despite the all-new Olds Achieva and Delta 88 models for 1992, the Cutlass Ciera was still Oldsmobile's best-selling model line, with over 132,000 sedans and an additional 7,793 wagons produced this year.\n\nFor 1993, the 2.5 L Tech IV engine was replaced by the 2.2 L \"2200\" OHV engine with a 3-speed automatic transmission.\n\nIn 1994, the 'SL' designation was dropped. The 'Cutlass Ciera S', available in sedan or wagon form, featured a driver airbag as standard equipment, along with anti-lock brakes, adjustable steering column, electric rear-window defogger, automatic door locks, and delay wipers. The 3.1 liter, Chevrolet V6 engine with a 4-speed automatic transmission replaced the prior year's 3300 Buick V6. This engine was standard on the Cruiser wagon and optional on the sedan. The 2200 I-4 received minor updates, resulting in a 10-horsepower increase.\n\nFor 1995, the 'SL' designation returned in place of the 'S'. The 1995 Cutlass Ciera SL featured a new shift interlock system that required stepping on the brake pedal before moving the gear shift out of park.\n\nFor 1996, the final model year, the 'Cutlass' nomenclature was dropped and the car was now known simply as the 'Ciera SL', which continued to be available in 'Series I' or 'Series II' equipment levels. The chrome \"Oldsmobile\" badge above the driver's headlight was deleted. During this time, Oldsmobile attempted to revamp itself as a European-styled upscale make with new products such as the [[Oldsmobile Aurora|Aurora]], but the Cutlass Ciera's continued strong sales proved almost an embarrassment due to its dated design and perceived image as an \"[[old man's car]]\". On the other hand, because the tooling for the A-body platform had long since been monetized, GM was guaranteed a profit off each Cutlass Ciera and [[Buick Century]] sold. At the same time, GM was losing massive amounts of money on its other midsized platform, the [[GM W platform|W-platform]]. In addition, build quality and reliability of the cars was extremely good by this point.{{dubious|By what standard?|date=March 2018}} Production of the Ciera ended on August 30, 1996.<ref name='Wards97'>{{cite book |title=Ward's Automotive Yearbook 1997 |publisher=Ward's Communications |year=1997 |page=105}}</ref> It was replaced in the U.S. by the [[GM N platform|N-body]] 1997 [[Oldsmobile Cutlass]], also built at the [[Oklahoma City Assembly|Oklahoma City assembly plant]]. As a result, the 1996 Cruiser wagon was the final Oldsmobile station wagon model produced. Sales of this Ciera replacement peaked at 53,438 in 1998 and it was discontinued in 1999.\n\n===Engines===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n! Years!! Engine!! Power!!

In Mexico, local production allowed for unique models under the name Chevrolet Cutlass. These models featured the coupe body style and International model until discontinuation in 1996. These vehicles were also offered with 5 speed manual transmissions.\n\n==Awards==\nThe Cutlass Ciera consistently ranked among the highest rated vehicles by J.D. Power and Associates; it was ranked the \"Best in Price Class\" on July 30, 1992 and the \"Top-Ranked American-Made Car\" on May 28, 1992. It was also named \"Safe Car of the Year\" by Prevention Magazine on March 6, 1992.\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe Cutlass Ciera appeared repeatedly in the first season (1993) of the TV series [[The X-Files]], mostly as a rental vehicle driven by the main characters.<ref>https://www.imcdb.org/v042039.html</ref><ref>https://www.imcdb.org/v042040.html</ref><ref>https://www.imcdb.org/v007148.html</ref><ref>https://www.imcdb.org/vehicle_42046-Oldsmobile-Cutlass-Ciera-1993.html</ref>\nThe Cutlass Ciera is also featured prominently in the 1996 film [[Fargo (film)|Fargo]], which is partially set in an Oldsmobile dealership.

It shared the [[front-wheel drive]] [[GM A platform (FWD)|A platform]] with the similar [[Buick Century]], [[Pontiac 6000]] and [[Chevrolet Celebrity]]; both Oldsmobile and [[Chevrolet]] considered using the Celebrity name, which had originally been used on the [[Oldsmobile 88|Eighty Eight]] model in the 1960s.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Witzenburg |first=Gary |title=The Name Game |journal=Motor Trend |date=April 1984 |page=82}}</ref> Available body styles included a 2-door [[coupe]], 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]], and the '''Cutlass (Ciera) Cruiser''' [[station wagon]]. Based on the [[GM X platform (1980)|GM X-Body]], this platform served as the basis for the [[GM U platform|GM U-Body]] vans.\n\n==Development==\nThe 1980's was a time of great transition for General Motors. [[Roger Smith (executive)|CEO Roger B. Smith]] invested heavily in computerization, front wheel drive and advanced assembly processes. One of the first products to reach the marketplace under this program was the GM A-Body. The Cutlass Ciera, like its A-Body platform mates, benefited from GM's Computer Command Control system, MacPherson strut front suspension, body color urethane bumpers, flush mounted glass, front wheel drive and on many models, fuel injection. The Cutlass Ciera shared the [[Oldsmobile Cutlass|Cutlass]] nameplate with the smaller [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Calais|Cutlass Calais]] and the larger [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme|Cutlass Supreme]], often creating confusion among the buying public as all three were available concurrently during the late 1980s and early 1990s. \n\nInitially, the Cutlass Ciera and its platform mates were premium mid sized offerings, holding a higher market position than the X-Body, from which they were derived, and the [[GM N platform|N-Body]] Calais, which would follow for 1985. The Cutlass Ciera and Cruiser were intended as replacements for the venerable rear wheel drive G-Body Cutlass models, but strong sales kept the higher trim Cutlass Supreme in production until the 1988 model year, when it was replaced by the all new GM W-Body models. As such, these front wheel drive sedans carried the A-Body designation, previously reserved for their rear wheel drive showroom companions. In order to keep both lines in production, General Motors rechristened the rear wheel drive mid sized platform as the [[GM G platform|G-Body]] beginning with the 1982 model year. When the W-Body intermediates were introduced for 1988, Oldsmobile \"decontented\" its Cutlass Ciera by reducing the number of options and configurations available to the public. During the model years that followed, luxury and performance options such as FE3 suspension, Auto Calculator, bucket seats, leather seating areas, sunroofs, and full instrumentation were eliminated.  After 1990, special editions were dropped from the American market and by the end of 1991, the coupe was discontinued. Although slimmed down to just two trim levels and two body styles, sedan and wagon, the 1996 final run of Oldsmobile Cieras were still Oldsmobile's best selling product line.\n\n==Special editions==\nThe car enjoyed many factory specialty models including the Holiday Coupe, GT, ES, XC, and International Series models \u2013 the latter of which had a stock body kit. \n\n'''Holiday Coupe'''\n[[File:1985 Cutlass Ciera Holiday Coupe.jpg|thumb|1985 Cutlass Ciera Holiday coupe (RPO WJ5) in Pastel Beige with Saddle top and interior. ]]\nFrom 1984 to March 1986, Oldsmobile offered a special edition Holiday Coupe package, option WJ5, on the Brougham coupe. This package included a unique landau vinyl roof (RPO C10), opera windows, special rooftop trim and painted pin stripes. The Holiday Coupe package required tinted glass and could not be ordered with standard pin stripes. It was discontinued part way through the 1986 model year, when Oldsmobile introduced the updated coupe roof line. All Holiday coupes were converted by the American Sunroof Company (ASC) outside of the factory. Oldsmobile would ship ASC Brougham coupes equipped with tinted glass to modify at their facility. These models have an ASC decal in the driver side door frame indicating the factory authorized conversion. \n\n'''ES'''\nThe ES (RPO W48) sedan was available from 1983-1985. These vehicles feature unique wheel covers, blacked out trim, F41 performance suspension, black sidewall tires, center console with bucket seats and a sport steering wheel. For 1985 only the ES sedan returned, as the coupe had been renamed GT. \n\n'''GT'''\nThe GT (RPO W45) was first offered as an option on the 1985 Ciera coupe.<ref>http://blog.consumerguide.com/cheap-wheels-1986-90-oldsmobile-cutlass-ciera-gtinternational-series-coupe/</ref> It featured blacked out trim, V6 engine, center console with bucket seats, fog lamps factory body kit, alloy wheels and performance suspension. For 1986, it was expanded to the four door sedan, replacing the ES. Following the 1987 model year, it was replaced by the International Series.\n\n'''International Series'''\nFrom 1988 to 1990, the International Series (RPO W45/W49) was the top performance trim available on the Ciera. It featured the 3.8 liter V6 for 1988 and the 3.3 liter V6 for 1989 and 1990. Available on coupe and sedan models, it featured a factory body kit, bucket seats with console, FE3 performance suspension, alloy wheels, full instrumentation, air conditioning JA2 heavy duty brakes, extra capacity cooling, and unique ornamentation.<ref>http://blog.consumerguide.com/cheap-wheels-1986-90-oldsmobile-cutlass-ciera-gtinternational-series-coupe/</ref>\n\n'''XC''' The XC was introduced as part of Oldsmobile's 90th Anniversary celebrations (XC being Roman Numeral or 90) and remained on the option sheet from 1988 to 1990<ref>https://sites.google.com/view/cutlasscieraresourcecenter/home/1988</ref>. It was available on coupe and sedan models. Sharing much of its sporty appearance with the International Series, the XC is distinguished by orange body side stripes in place of the typical black and chrome trim. Unlike the similar looking International Series, the XC package did not include a standard V6, 4 speed automatic, or other higher end features. These had to be ordered in addition to the XC package. \n\nOldsmobile never produced a factory convertible of this A-Body model for public sale, but many dealers did make them available via aftermarket conversions. Between 1983 and 1986, 814 Cutlass Ciera convertibles were made by [[Hess & Eisenhardt|Hess & Eisenhardt/Car Craft]].<ref>https://www.hemmings.com/blog/article/everyday-cutlass-ciera/</ref> These vehicles were Brougham coupes, modified with leather interior and chassis reinforcement to provide the needed structural rigidity that was lost by removing the roof.\n\n==1982\u20131988==\n[[File:Early Olds Cutlass Ciera.jpg|thumb|left|1982\u20131984 Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera sedan]]\nProduction began September 28, 1981 at [[Doraville Assembly]] in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] for the 1982 model year.<ref name='Wards82'>{{cite book |title=Ward's Automotive Yearbook 1982 |publisher=Ward's Communications |year=1982}}</ref>  In 1984, the Cutlass Cruiser [[station wagon]] model moved to the Cutlass Ciera's platform; previously, the nameplate used the [[rear wheel drive]] [[GM G platform (RWD)|G-body]]. The Cutlass Ciera came in three trim levels: the base, LS, and ''Brougham'' {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|b|r|o\u02d0|\u0259|m}}.\n\nThe standard engine was a 2.5 L four-cylinder Tech IV ([[Iron Duke engine|Pontiac Iron Duke]]) engine. All models also included standard bench seats and cloth interior.  Available on all models were a 3.0 L Buick V6 engine, or a 4.3 L Oldsmobile Diesel V6 engine. Brougham trim added a  plush interior with vinyl accents, leatherette interior door pulls, additional chrome trim and a reading lamp. The base coupe and sedan were initially dropped after 1982 due to poor sales, leaving LS and Brougham trim as the only available from 1983-1985, excluding special editions. During the model year, production ended at the [[Fremont Assembly|Fremont GM Assembly Plant]] due to that facility closing. \n\n1983 Added a new ES trim package for the coupe and sedan models. This would be the last year for the standard 13\" wheels. \n\nFor the 1984, the line added a new Cruiser wagon, replacing the former G-Body Cutlass Cruiser. A 3.8 liter Buick V6 and the Holiday Coupe package joined the option list<ref>https://sites.google.com/view/cutlasscieraresourcecenter/home/1984</ref> as did a 4 speed manual transmission for diesel models. This transmission was dropped in the fall of 1983 from the option list. \n\nFor 1985, the Cutlass Ciera received its first facelift with revised grille, headlamps, taillights and interiors. The GT coupe was added as a companion to the ES sedan. In spring 1985 the Oldsmobile designed 4.3-liter diesel was dropped due to poor sales. Canadian models added the 2.8 liter 2bbl V6 to this year. \n\nFor 1986, the Cutlass Ciera's grille had expanded ventilation sections than the similar 1985 model. The coupe received a new, more rounded roofline that was not initially shared with the other GM A-body models, but later migrated to the Buick Century coupe. These models are easily identifiable by their sweeping roofline and updated VIN identification, which replaced the \"27\" coupe designation used form 1982 until March 1986 with \"37\". 1986 also saw the addition of the 2.8 liter V6 in place of the previously offered Buick 3.0 liter V6 in the American market. The 2.8 liter engine had previously been offered in Canadian Ciera's with the 2-barrel carburetor.  In compliance with federal regulations, the 1986 Ciera was the first to have a high mount brake light as standard equipment. The Cutlass Ciera nameplate appeared on the rear fiberglass panel, just below the trunk lid.\n\n[[File:1985 Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera Brougham Convertible (H&E), front left at Hershey 2019.jpg|thumb|1985 Cutlass Ciera Convertible conversion by Hess & Eisenhardt]]\nFor 1987, the Cutlass Ciera was facelifted again with a new grille, updated steering wheel had the Oldsmobile logo moved from the right to the very center, and the 2.8 L ''LE2'' V6 engine was dropped in favor of the more powerful LB6 unit. In addition, Brougham and GT models received composite headlamps as standard equipment. The 2.5 liter Iron Duke 4 cylinder received minor updates, including a serpentine belt, which replaced the previous engine belt set up, for a boost of 6 horsepower, to 98.  Ciera's tail lamps were slightly revised, adding ribs to their lower quarter.\n\nFor 1988, the base Cutlass Ciera received composite headlamps, the new ''International Series'' models were introduced, and this would be the last year for the ''Brougham'', which was rechristened the Brougham SL on coupe models. The ''International Series'' included the emblem with the flags of various countries below the nameplate (see below for exemplar) and was available on coupe and sedan body styles. This model came equipped with a standard Buick 3.8 liter V6 engine, 4-speed automatic transmission, sporty exhaust system, front bucket seats, and power windows. Composite headlamps were made standard on all Cutlass Ciera models. Sedan models could have the new power sliding sunroof for the first time.<ref>https://sites.google.com/view/cutlasscieraresourcecenter/home/1988</ref>\n\n\n===Engines===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

Rear seat shoulder belts were added. Both coupe and sedan models received updated rear-end treatments. The older Buick 3.8 liter V6 was dropped in favor of GM's new [[GM 3300 engine|3300 V6]] engine. The Brougham trim level was eliminated, replaced by an upper level SL trim. A new XC wagon also joined the option sheet this year.<ref>https://sites.google.com/view/cutlasscieraresourcecenter/home/1989</ref> \n\nFor 1990, the front seat belts were moved from the B-pillars to the doors. This would also be the last year for the 'International Series' and 'XC'. \n\nThe changes for 1991 included a new instrument cluster with a trip odometer and an engine temperature gauge. 6 speaker sound systems were added as was a remote lock fob and improved body acoustics. This would be the last year for the coupe in the United States and Canada, but it would continue on in the Mexican market. \n\nFor 1992, the coupe was dropped, and the line-up included only sedans and wagons in 'S' or 'SL' designations. The wagon now had some internal competition in the form of the new [[Oldsmobile Silhouette]] minivan (itself based on the Cutlass Ciera's A-platform), offering buyers a choice of traditional station wagon or a multi-configurable minivan. Despite the all-new Olds Achieva and Delta 88 models for 1992, the Cutlass Ciera was still Oldsmobile's best-selling model line, with over 132,000 sedans and an additional 7,793 wagons produced this year. \n\nFor 1993, the 2.5 L Tech IV engine was replaced by the 2.2 L \"2200\" OHV engine with a 3-speed automatic transmission. \n\nIn 1994, the 'SL' designation was dropped. The 'Cutlass Ciera S', available in sedan or wagon form, featured a driver airbag as standard equipment, along with anti-lock brakes, adjustable steering column, electric rear-window defogger, automatic door locks, and delay wipers. The 3.1 liter, Chevrolet V6 engine with a 4-speed automatic transmission replaced the prior year's 3300 Buick V6. This engine was standard on the Cruiser wagon and optional on the sedan. The 2200 I-4 received minor updates, resulting in a 10 horsepower increase.\n\nFor 1995, the 'SL' designation returned in place of the 'S'. The 1995 Cutlass Ciera SL featured a new shift interlock system that required stepping on the brake pedal before moving the gear shift out of park. \n\nFor 1996, the final model year, the 'Cutlass' nomenclature was dropped and the car was now known simply as the 'Ciera SL', which continued to be available in 'Series I' or 'Series II' equipment levels. The chrome \"Oldsmobile\" badge above the driver's headlight was deleted. During this time, Oldsmobile attempted to revamp itself as a European-styled upscale make with new products such as the [[Oldsmobile Aurora|Aurora]], but the Cutlass Ciera's continued strong sales proved almost an embarrassment due to its dated design and perceived image as an \"[[old man's car]]\". On the other hand, because the tooling for the A-body platform had long since been monetized, GM was guaranteed a profit off each Cutlass Ciera and [[Buick Century]] sold. At the same time, GM was losing massive amounts of money on its other midsized platform, the [[GM W platform|W-platform]]. In addition, build quality and reliability of the cars was extremely good by this point.{{dubious|By what standard?|date=March 2018}} Production of the Ciera ended on August 30, 1996.<ref name='Wards97'>{{cite book |title=Ward's Automotive Yearbook 1997 |publisher=Ward's Communications |year=1997 |page=105}}</ref> It was replaced in the U.S. by the [[GM N platform|N-body]] 1997 [[Oldsmobile Cutlass]], also built at the [[Oklahoma City Assembly|Oklahoma City assembly plant]]. As a result, the 1996 Cruiser wagon was the final Oldsmobile station wagon model produced. Sales of this Ciera replacement peaked at 53,438 in 1998 and it was discontinued in 1999.\n\n===Engines===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n! Years!! Engine!! Power!!

It was also named \"Safe Car of the Year\" by Prevention Magazine on March 6, 1992.\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe Cutlass Ciera appeared repeatedly in the first season (1993) of the TV series [[The X-Files]], mostly as a rental vehicle driven by the main characters.<ref>https://www.imcdb.org/v042039.html</ref><ref>https://www.imcdb.org/v042040.html</ref><ref>https://www.imcdb.org/v007148.html</ref><ref>https://www.imcdb.org/vehicle_42046-Oldsmobile-Cutlass-Ciera-1993.html</ref>\nThe Cutlass Ciera is also featured prominently in the 1996 film [[Fargo (film)|Fargo]], which is partially set in an Oldsmobile dealership.

As a salt, in water, cold, and free from air and light exposure, it is stable indefinitely.\"<ref name=\"tihkal\" />\n\nLSD has two [[Lability|labile]] protons at the tertiary stereogenic C5 and C8 positions, rendering these centres prone to [[epimerisation]]. The C8 proton is more labile due to the electron-withdrawing [[carboxamide]] attachment, but removal of the [[Chirality|chiral]] proton at the C5 position (which was once also an alpha proton of the parent molecule [[tryptophan]]) is assisted by the inductively withdrawing nitrogen and pi electron delocalisation with the [[indole]] ring.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\nLSD also has [[enamine]]-type reactivity because of the electron-donating effects of the indole ring. Because of this, [[chlorine]] destroys LSD molecules on contact; even though chlorinated tap water contains only a slight amount of chlorine, the small quantity of compound typical to an LSD solution will likely be eliminated when dissolved in tap water.<ref name=\"tihkal\" /> The [[covalent bond|double bond]] between the 8-position and the [[aromatic hydrocarbon|aromatic ring]], being conjugated with the indole ring, is susceptible to [[Nucleophile|nucleophilic]] attacks by water or [[alcohol]], especially in the presence of light. LSD often converts to \"lumi-LSD,\" which is inactive in human beings.<ref name=\"tihkal\" />\n\nA controlled study was undertaken to determine the stability of LSD in pooled urine samples.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Li Z, McNally AJ, Wang H, Salamone SJ | title = Stability study of LSD under various storage conditions | journal = Journal of Analytical Toxicology | volume = 22 | issue = 6 | pages = 520\u20135 | date = October 1998 | pmid = 9788528 | doi = 10.1093/jat/22.6.520 }}</ref>\nThe concentrations of LSD in urine samples were followed over time at various temperatures, in different types of storage containers, at various exposures to different wavelengths of light, and at varying pH values. These studies demonstrated no significant loss in LSD concentration at 25&nbsp;\u00b0C for up to four weeks. After four weeks of incubation, a 30% loss in LSD concentration at 37&nbsp;\u00b0C and up to a 40% at 45&nbsp;\u00b0C were observed. Urine fortified with LSD and stored in amber glass or nontransparent polyethylene containers showed no change in concentration under any light conditions. Stability of LSD in transparent containers under light was dependent on the distance between the light source and the samples, the wavelength of light, exposure time, and the intensity of light. After prolonged exposure to heat in alkaline pH conditions, 10 to 15% of the parent LSD epimerized to iso-LSD. Under acidic conditions, less than 5% of the LSD was converted to iso-LSD. It was also demonstrated that trace amounts of metal ions in buffer or urine could catalyze the decomposition of LSD and that this process can be avoided by the addition of [[EDTA]].\n\n===Detection===\nLSD may be quantified in urine as part of a [[Drug test|drug abuse testing program]], in plasma or serum to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized victims or in whole blood to assist in a forensic investigation of a traffic or other criminal violation or a case of sudden death. Both the parent drug and its major metabolite are unstable in biofluids when exposed to light, heat or alkaline conditions and therefore specimens are protected from light, stored at the lowest possible temperature and analyzed quickly to minimize losses.<ref>R.

The Psychedelic Shop helped to further popularize LSD in the Haight and to make the neighborhood the unofficial capital of the hippie counterculture in the United States.  Ron Thelin was also involved in organizing the Love Pageant rally, a protest held in Golden Gate park to protest California's newly adopted ban on LSD in October 1966.

Lambert and the Gorgettes, from the album ''Abbra Cadaver'', 1967}}\nA similar and connected nexus of LSD use in the creative arts developed around the same time in [[London]]. A key figure in this phenomenon in the UK was British academic [[Michael Hollingshead]], who first tried LSD in America in 1961 while he was the Executive Secretary for the Institute of British-American Cultural Exchange. After being given a large quantity of pure Sandoz LSD (which was still legal at the time) and experiencing his first \"trip,\" Hollingshead contacted [[Aldous Huxley]], who suggested that he get in touch with Harvard academic [[Timothy Leary]], and over the next few years, in concert with Leary and [[Richard Alpert]], Hollingshead played a major role in their famous LSD research at [[Millbrook, New York|Millbrook]] before moving to New York City, where he conducted his own LSD experiments. In 1965 Hollingshead returned to the UK and founded the World Psychedelic Center in [[Chelsea, London]].\n\n===Music and art===\n{{Main|LSD art}}\nIn both music and art, the influence of LSD was soon being more widely seen and heard thanks to the bands that participated in the Acid Tests and related events, including [[the Grateful Dead]], [[Jefferson Airplane]] and [[Big Brother and the Holding Company]], and through the inventive poster and album art of San Francisco-based artists like [[Rick Griffin]], [[Victor Moscoso]], [[Bonnie MacLean]], [[Stanley Mouse]] & [[Alton Kelley]], and [[Wes Wilson]], meant to evoke the visual experience of an LSD trip. LSD had a strong influence on the Grateful Dead and the culture of \"[[Deadhead]]s.\"<ref name=Jarnow/>\n\nAmong the many famous people in the UK that Michael Hollingshead is reputed to have introduced to LSD are artist and [[Hipgnosis]] founder [[Storm Thorgerson]], and musicians [[Donovan]], [[Keith Richards]], [[Paul McCartney]], [[John Lennon]], and [[George Harrison]]. Although establishment concern about the new drug led to it being declared an illegal drug by the Home Secretary in 1966, LSD was soon being used widely in the upper echelons of the British art and music scene, including members of [[the Beatles]], [[the Rolling Stones]], [[the Moody Blues]], the [[Small Faces]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Jimi Hendrix]] and others, and the products of these experiences were soon being both heard and seen by the public with singles like the Small Faces' \"[[Itchycoo Park]]\" and LPs like the Beatles' ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' and Cream's ''[[Disraeli Gears]]'', which featured music that showed the obvious influence of the musicians' recent psychedelic excursions, and which were packaged in elaborately-designed album covers that featured vividly-coloured psychedelic artwork by artists like [[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]], [[Martin Sharp]], [[Hapshash and the Coloured Coat]] ([[Nigel Waymouth]] and [[Michael English (illustrator)|Michael English]]) and art/music collective [[The Fool (design collective)|The Fool]].\n\nIn the 1960s, musicians from [[psychedelic music]] and [[psychedelic rock]] bands began to refer (at first indirectly, and later explicitly) to the drug and attempted to recreate or reflect the experience of taking LSD in their music. A number of features are often included in psychedelic music. Exotic instrumentation, with a particular fondness for the [[sitar]] and [[tabla]] are common.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Rubin R, Melnick JP | title = Immigration and American Popular Culture: an Introduction | location = New York, NY | publisher = New York University Press | date = 2007 | isbn = 978-0-8147-7552-3 | pages = 162\u20134 }}</ref> Electric guitars are used to create [[Audio feedback|feedback]], and are played through [[Wah-wah (music)|wah wah]] and [[Distortion (music)|fuzzbox]] effect pedals.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Prown P, Newquist HP, Eiche JF | title = Legends of Rock Guitar: the Essential Reference of Rock's Greatest Guitarists | location = London | publisher = Hal Leonard Corporation, 1997 | isbn = 0-7935-4042-9 | pages = 48 | year = 1997 }}</ref>  Elaborate studio effects are often used, such as [[backmasking|backwards tapes]], [[Panning (audio)|panning]], [[phasing]], long [[Music loop|delay loops]], and extreme [[reverb]].<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Borthwick S, Moy R | title = Popular Music Genres: an Introduction | location = Edinburgh | publisher = Edinburgh University Press | date = 2004 | isbn = 0-7486-1745-0 | pages = 52\u20134 }}</ref> In the 1960s there was a use of primitive electronic instruments such as early synthesizers and the [[theremin]].<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = DeRogatis J | title = Turn On Your Mind: Four Decades of Great Psychedelic Rock | location = Milwaukie | publisher = Hal Leonard | date = 2003 | isbn = 0-634-05548-8 |page=230}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | first1 = Richie | last1 = Unterberger | first2 = Samb | last2 = Hicks | first3 = Jennifer | last3 = Dempsey | name-list-format = vanc | title = Music USA: the rough guide | publisher = Rough Guides | date = 1999 | isbn = 1-85828-421-X | pages = [https://archive.org/details/musicusaroughgui0000unte/page/391 391] | url = https://archive.org/details/musicusaroughgui0000unte/page/391 }}</ref> Later forms of electronic psychedelia also employed repetitive computer-generated beats.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = St John G | title = Rave Culture and Religion | location = Abingdon | publisher = Routledge | date = 2004 | isbn = 0-415-31449-6 | pages = 52 }}</ref> Songs allegedly referring to LSD include [[John Prine]]'s \"Illegal Smile\" and the Beatles' song \"[[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds]],\" although the authors of the latter song repeatedly denied this claim.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sheff |first=David | name-list-format = vanc |year=2000 |authorlink=David Sheff |title=All We Are Saying: The Last Major Interview with John Lennon and Yoko Ono |publisher=St. Martin's Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-312-25464-3 |ref=harv |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/allwearesayingla00lenn }}</ref><ref name=\"life\">{{cite magazine |last=Thompson |first=Thomas | name-list-format = vanc |date=16 June 1967 |title=The New Far-Out Beatles |magazine=Life |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lVYEAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover&pg=101#v=onepage&q&f=false |location=Chicago|publisher=Time Inc. |pages = 101 |access-date=8 Dec 2016 }}</ref><ref name=\"itv\">{{cite interview |last=McCartney |first=Paul | name-list-format = vanc |subjectlink=Paul McCartney |work=[[ITV Evening News]] |publisher=[[Independent Television News]] |location=London |date=19 June 1967 |url=http://www.beatlesinterviews.org/db1967.0619.beatles.html |title=Interview with Paul McCartney |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161015170416/http://www.beatlesinterviews.org/db1967.0619.beatles.html |archive-date=October 15, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn modern times, LSD has had a prominent influence on artists such as [[Keith Haring]], [[electronic dance music]], and the [[jam band]] [[Phish]].\n\n===Legal status===\nThe [[United Nations]] [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]] (adopted in 1971) requires the signing parties to prohibit LSD.

By classifying LSD as a Schedule I substance, the DEA holds that LSD meets the following three criteria: it is deemed to have a high potential for abuse; it has no legitimate medical use in treatment; and there is a lack of accepted safety for its use under medical supervision. There are no documented deaths from chemical [[toxicity]]; most LSD deaths are a result of behavioral toxicity.<ref>{{EMedicine|article|1011615|LSD Toxicity}}</ref>\n\nThere can also be substantial discrepancies between the amount of chemical LSD that one possesses and the amount of possession with which one can be charged in the US. This is because LSD is almost always present in a medium (e.g. blotter or neutral liquid), and in some contexts, the amount that can be considered with respect to sentencing is the total mass of the drug and its medium. This discrepancy was the subject of 1995 [[United States Supreme Court]] case, ''Neal v. United States'', which determined that for finding minimum sentence lengths, the total medium weight is used, while for determining the severity of the offense, an estimation of the chemical mass is used.<ref>{{cite court| litigants=Neal v.

Twenty five kilograms of precursor [[ergotamine]] [[tartrate]] can produce 5\u20136&nbsp;kg of pure crystalline LSD; this corresponds to 100&nbsp;million doses.

It takes two to three days to produce 30 to 100 grams of pure compound. It is believed that LSD is not usually produced in large quantities, but rather in a series of small batches.

As a salt, in water, cold, and free from air and light exposure, it is stable indefinitely.\"<ref name=\"tihkal\" />\n\nLSD has two [[Lability|labile]] protons at the tertiary stereogenic C5 and C8 positions, rendering these centres prone to [[epimerisation]]. The C8 proton is more labile due to the electron-withdrawing [[carboxamide]] attachment, but removal of the [[Chirality|chiral]] proton at the C5 position (which was once also an alpha proton of the parent molecule [[tryptophan]]) is assisted by the inductively withdrawing nitrogen and pi electron delocalisation with the [[indole]] ring.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\nLSD also has [[enamine]]-type reactivity because of the electron-donating effects of the indole ring. Because of this, [[chlorine]] destroys LSD molecules on contact; even though chlorinated tap water contains only a slight amount of chlorine, the small quantity of compound typical to an LSD solution will likely be eliminated when dissolved in tap water.<ref name=\"tihkal\" /> The [[covalent bond|double bond]] between the 8-position and the [[aromatic hydrocarbon|aromatic ring]], being conjugated with the indole ring, is susceptible to [[Nucleophile|nucleophilic]] attacks by water or [[alcohol]], especially in the presence of light. LSD often converts to \"lumi-LSD,\" which is inactive in human beings.<ref name=\"tihkal\" />\n\nA controlled study was undertaken to determine the stability of LSD in pooled urine samples.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Li Z, McNally AJ, Wang H, Salamone SJ | title = Stability study of LSD under various storage conditions | journal = Journal of Analytical Toxicology | volume = 22 | issue = 6 | pages = 520\u20135 | date = October 1998 | pmid = 9788528 | doi = 10.1093/jat/22.6.520 }}</ref>\nThe concentrations of LSD in urine samples were followed over time at various temperatures, in different types of storage containers, at various exposures to different wavelengths of light, and at varying pH values. These studies demonstrated no significant loss in LSD concentration at 25&nbsp;\u00b0C for up to four weeks. After four weeks of incubation, a 30% loss in LSD concentration at 37&nbsp;\u00b0C and up to a 40% at 45&nbsp;\u00b0C were observed. Urine fortified with LSD and stored in amber glass or nontransparent polyethylene containers showed no change in concentration under any light conditions. Stability of LSD in transparent containers under light was dependent on the distance between the light source and the samples, the wavelength of light, exposure time, and the intensity of light. After prolonged exposure to heat in alkaline pH conditions, 10 to 15% of the parent LSD epimerized to iso-LSD. Under acidic conditions, less than 5% of the LSD was converted to iso-LSD. It was also demonstrated that trace amounts of metal ions in buffer or urine could catalyze the decomposition of LSD and that this process can be avoided by the addition of [[EDTA]].\n\n===Detection===\nLSD may be quantified in urine as part of a [[Drug test|drug abuse testing program]], in plasma or serum to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized victims or in whole blood to assist in a forensic investigation of a traffic or other criminal violation or a case of sudden death. Both the parent drug and its major metabolite are unstable in biofluids when exposed to light, heat or alkaline conditions and therefore specimens are protected from light, stored at the lowest possible temperature and analyzed quickly to minimize losses.<ref>R.

Lambert and the Gorgettes, from the album ''Abbra Cadaver'', 1967}}\nA similar and connected nexus of LSD use in the creative arts developed around the same time in [[London]]. A key figure in this phenomenon in the UK was British academic [[Michael Hollingshead]], who first tried LSD in America in 1961 while he was the Executive Secretary for the Institute of British-American Cultural Exchange. After being given a large quantity of pure Sandoz LSD (which was still legal at the time) and experiencing his first \"trip,\" Hollingshead contacted [[Aldous Huxley]], who suggested that he get in touch with Harvard academic [[Timothy Leary]], and over the next few years, in concert with Leary and [[Richard Alpert]], Hollingshead played a major role in their famous LSD research at [[Millbrook, New York|Millbrook]] before moving to New York City, where he conducted his own LSD experiments. In 1965 Hollingshead returned to the UK and founded the World Psychedelic Center in [[Chelsea, London]].\n\n===Music and art===\n{{Main|LSD art}}\nIn both music and art, the influence of LSD was soon being more widely seen and heard thanks to the bands that participated in the Acid Tests and related events, including [[the Grateful Dead]], [[Jefferson Airplane]] and [[Big Brother and the Holding Company]], and through the inventive poster and album art of San Francisco-based artists like [[Rick Griffin]], [[Victor Moscoso]], [[Bonnie MacLean]], [[Stanley Mouse]] & [[Alton Kelley]], and [[Wes Wilson]], meant to evoke the visual experience of an LSD trip. LSD had a strong influence on the Grateful Dead and the culture of \"[[Deadhead]]s.\"<ref name=Jarnow/>\n\nAmong the many famous people in the UK that Michael Hollingshead is reputed to have introduced to LSD are artist and [[Hipgnosis]] founder [[Storm Thorgerson]], and musicians [[Donovan]], [[Keith Richards]], [[Paul McCartney]], [[John Lennon]], and [[George Harrison]]. Although establishment concern about the new drug led to it being declared an illegal drug by the Home Secretary in 1966, LSD was soon being used widely in the upper echelons of the British art and music scene, including members of [[the Beatles]], [[the Rolling Stones]], [[the Moody Blues]], the [[Small Faces]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Jimi Hendrix]] and others, and the products of these experiences were soon being both heard and seen by the public with singles like the Small Faces' \"[[Itchycoo Park]]\" and LPs like the Beatles' ''[[Sgt.

There are no documented deaths from chemical [[toxicity]]; most LSD deaths are a result of behavioral toxicity.<ref>{{EMedicine|article|1011615|LSD Toxicity}}</ref>\n\nThere can also be substantial discrepancies between the amount of chemical LSD that one possesses and the amount of possession with which one can be charged in the US. This is because LSD is almost always present in a medium (e.g. blotter or neutral liquid), and in some contexts, the amount that can be considered with respect to sentencing is the total mass of the drug and its medium. This discrepancy was the subject of 1995 [[United States Supreme Court]] case, ''Neal v.
