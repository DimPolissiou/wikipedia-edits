GT cars were now [[Group 3 (racing)|Group 3]] and Prototypes were now [[Group 6 (racing)|Group 6]]. Two new classes for Sports Cars were [[Group 4 (racing)|Group 4]] and [[Group 5 (racing)|Group 5]] for \u2018Special Sports Cars\u2019 (Group 1 and 2 covered Touring Cars, [[Group 7 (racing)|Group 7]] led to the [[1966 Can-Am season|Can-Am series]], with Group 8 and 9 for single-seaters).<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.208\">Spurring 2010, p.208</ref>\n\nAs Group 7 were ineligible for FIA events, the [[Automobile Club de l'Ouest]] (ACO) opened its entry list to Group 3, 4 and 6. The FIA mandated minimum annual production runs of 500 cars for Group 3 (up from 100 previously<ref name=\"Clausager 1982, p.140\">Clausager 1982, p.140</ref><ref name=\"Moity 1974, p.102-4\">Moity 1974, p.102-4</ref>) and 50 for Group 4,<ref name=\"Moity 1974, p.102-4\"/>  which also had a maximum engine capacity of 5000cc. There were no engine limits on the GTs or Prototypes. As before, the Groups were split up in classes based on engine size, there was a sliding scale of a minimum weight based on the increasing engine size (from 450 to 1000&nbsp;kg for 500 to 7000cc) as was fuel-tank capacity (60 to 160 litres).<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.208\"/>\n\nAlong with the new Appendix J, after four years of focus on GT racing the FIA announced the International Manufacturer's Championship, for Group 6 Prototypes (2L / >2L), and the International Sports Car Championship for Group 4 (1.3L / 2L / 5L).<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.208\"/>\n\n==Entries==\n[[File:Ford GT40 Mark II at Goodwood Revival 2013 001.jpg|left|thumb|[[Ford GT40]] Mark II ]]\n[[File:Ferrari-330p3-2.jpg|left|thumb|[[Ferrari 330 P3]]]]\n[[File:Porsche 906 Tour Auto 2014 Circuit de Dijon Prenois 03.jpg|left|thumb|Porsche 906 Carrera]]\nWith the new regulations this year the ACO received a huge 103 entry requests.

This time six were built and prepared by [[Carroll Shelby International|Shelby American]]. Shelby ran three cars himself for Americans [[Dan Gurney]] and [[Jerry Grant]], Miles was now paired with New Zealander [[Denny Hulme]] after Ruby had been injured in a plane crash a month earlier.<ref name=\"Fox 1973, p.198\">Fox 1973, p.198</ref> The third car was the all-[[Kiwi (people)|Kiwi]] pairing of [[Bruce McLaren]] and [[Chris Amon]].

Each of the eight cars was painted in a colour from the [[Ford Mustang (first generation)|Mustang]] road-car range.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.210-3\">Spurring 2010, p.210-3</ref><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.10\">Clarke 1997, p.10: Road & Track Sept 1966</ref>\n\nFerrari's response to the Mk II was the new [[Ferrari P#330 P3|Ferrari 330 P3]]. Shorter and wider than the P2, it kept the same 4-litre engine but with fuel-injection now put out 420&nbsp;bhp.<ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.209\"/> The works team had a pair of closed-cockpit versions for [[John Surtees]]/[[Ludovico Scarfiotti]] and former winners [[Lorenzo Bandini]]/[[Jean Guichet]]. An open-cockpit variant was given to the [[North American Racing Team]] (NART) for [[Pedro Rodriguez (racing driver)|Pedro Rodriguez]]/[[Richie Ginther]]. But their race preparation had been limited by strike action in Italy.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.217-9\">Spurring 2010, p.217-9</ref><ref name=\"Fox 1973, p.201\"/><ref name=\"Laban 2001, p.150-1\">Laban 2001, p.150-1</ref>\n\nNART also entered a long-tailed P2, rebodied by [[Piero Drogo]] and driven by last year's winner [[Masten Gregory]] with [[Bob Bondurant]]. There were also P2/P3 hybrids for the [[Ecurie Francorchamps]] (Dumay/\"Beurlys\") and [[Scuderia Filipinetti]] ([[Willy Mairesse|Mairesse]]/[[Herbert M\u00fcller (racing driver)|M\u00fcller]]. Finally there was a P2 Spyder for Maranello Concessionaires ([[Richard Attwood|Attwood]]/[[David Piper (racing driver)|Piper]]).<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.217-9\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.9\">Clarke 1997, p.9: Road & Track Sept 1966</ref> Fighting on two fronts, the company also took on Porsche in the 2-litre class with its [[Dino 206 S]] with a pair from NART and another for Maranello. [[Nino Vaccarella]], race winner in [[1964 24 Hours of Le Mans|1964]], was furious when he found out he was \u2018demoted\u2019 to drive the Dino rather than the P3 and threatened to walk out, but did, in the end run the car.<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.24\">Clarke 1997, p.24: Motor Jun25 1966</ref><ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.235\">Armstrong 1966, p.235</ref>\n\nChevrolet was the other player in the over 2-litre class. Ex-Ferrari engineer [[Giotto Bizzarrini]] had fallen out with [[Renzo Rivolta]] and with his own company brought his new design, the P538, but still using the 5.3L Chevrolet engine. The other Chevy was in Texan [[Jim Hall (racing driver)|Jim Hall]]\u2019s [[Chaparral Cars#2|Chaparral 2D]]. The 5.3L small block put out 420&nbsp;bhp and had a semi-automatic transmission.<ref name=\"Laban 2001, p.150-1\"/><ref name=\"Moity 1974, p.102-4\"/> Driven by [[Phil Hill]] and [[Jo Bonnier]], they made a big impact winning the N\u00fcrburgring round just two weeks earlier.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.227\">Spurring 2010, p.227</ref>\n\nPorsche came with a new model \u2013 the [[Porsche 906|906]] designed by the team led by [[Ferdinand Pi\u00ebch]]. With the 2.0L flat-6 engine from the 911, it had recently been homologated for Group 4 with the requisite 50 cars.<ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.210\">Armstrong 1966, p.210</ref> It was race-proven too, after winning the [[Targa Florio]] the month before. However three ''langheck'' (long-tail) prototypes were also entered by the works team, driven by [[Hans Herrmann]]/[[Herbert Linge]], [[Jo Siffert]]/[[Colin Davis (racing driver)|Colin Davis]] and [[Udo Sch\u00fctz]]/[[Peter de Klerk]].<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.220-1\">Spurring 2010, p.220-1</ref>\n\nAlfa Romeo, and its works team [[Autodelta]], had withdrawn from racing for a year to prepare a new car for 1967.<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.6-7\"/> But this year, a significant new manufacturer entered the fray: [[Matra]] had bought out [[Automobiles Ren\u00e9 Bonnet]] in 1964, rebadging the [[Matra Djet|Djet]]. However it was a new design that was entered. The M620 had a 2-litre version of the BRM Formula 1 engine developing 245&nbsp;bhp that could match the Porsches in speed, making 275&nbsp;kp/h (170&nbsp;mph). The three cars were driven by up and coming young French single-seater drivers [[Jean-Pierre Beltoise]]/[[Johnny Servoz-Gavin]], [[Jean-Pierre Jaussaud]]/[[Henri Pescarolo]] and [[Jo Schlesser]] with Welshman [[Alan Rees (racing driver)|Alan Rees]].<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.222\">Spurring 2010, p.222</ref>\n\nRemarkably, given British dominance of the race barely a decade earlier, there were only three British cars in this year's race. Defending class-champions Austin-Healey had two works entries. The other was a [[Marcos Engineering]] kit-car based on a Mini Cooper 'S' chassis. Entered by Frenchman Hubert Giraud and driven by Jean-Louis Marnat and Claude Ballot-Lena, the team was able to get a works engine and gearbox from [[British Motor Corporation|BMC]]. The spectators laughed at the small car and its apparent resemblance to a flea.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.233\">Spurring 2010, p.233</ref> But the Mini Marcos would became the 'darling of the crowds' later on in the race.\n\nAlpine, after its poor showing in the previous year, returned with 6 cars. The new A210 had a 1.3L Gordini-Renault engine with a Porsche gearbox making it more durable if only a little faster at 245&nbsp;kp/h (150&nbsp;mph). This year a new customer team, the Ecurie Savin-Calberson was supported by Alpine, with former Index winner Roger Delageneste.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.224\">Spurring 2010, p.224</ref>\n\n[[Charles Deutsch]] (CD) brought his new aerodynamic SP66. The car was powered by a 1130cc Peugeot engine, marking the return of the French company last seen in the 1938 race.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.231\">Spurring 2010, p.231</ref> Another competitor in the small prototypes was [[ASA (automobile)|ASA]]. Originally a Ferrari design by [[Carlo Chiti]] and [[Giotto Bizzarrini]] before their famous [[History of Ferrari#1961 \u2013 The great walkout|walk-out from Ferrari]], it was sold to the new Italian company and uprated with a 1290cc engine giving 125&nbsp;bhp. Two cars were entered, one by ASA and one by NART.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.228\">Spurring 2010, p.228</ref>\n\nThe new Group 4 category started attracting interest as the earlier prototypes were meeting the homologation and production requirements. There were six GT40s entered by customer teams, with the 4.7L engine. [[Jochen Rindt]], the previous year's winner, had moved across from Ferrari to Ford, in the new Canadian Comstock Racing Team. They joined Ford France, Scuderia Filipinetti and new privateers Scuderia Bear and [[Superior Essex|Essex Wire]]. Joining Skip Scott, team owner of the Essex Wire team, was a 21-year old [[Jacky Ickx]] in his Le Mans debut.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.214-5\">Spurring 2010, p.214-5</ref><ref name=\"Clausager 1982, p.147\">Clausager 1982, p.147</ref>\n\nUp against them was [[Ed Hugus]]\u2019 modified Ferrari 275 GTB and the [[Ecurie Nationale Belge|Equipe Nationale Belge]] ran its 250 LM. Porsche also ran three regular 906s in the Sports category, two works entries as well as one for their Paris importer Toto Veuillet.\n\nWith Shelby now fully concentrated on the Ford program, the Cobra GTs were abandoned. There were only three GT entries: the Ferrari customer teams Ecurie Francorchamps and Maranello Concessionaires both entered a 275 GTB. The third was a quiet though significant entry: Jacques Dewes, ever the pioneering privateer, brought the first Porsche 911 to Le Mans. Production of what would become the ubiquitous Le Mans car had started in late 1964 and the new 911 S model had its \u2018boxer\u2019 6-cylinder engine tuned to 160&nbsp;bhp.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.223\">Spurring 2010, p.223</ref>\n\nFinally, in a subcompetition of its own, there was the tire race between [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]], [[Dunlop Tyres|Dunlop]], and [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]].<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.6-7\"/>\n\n==Practice==\nOnce again there was rain at the April testing weekend. And once again there was tragedy with a fatal accident. American Walt Hansgen's Ford hit water on the pit straight and aquaplaned. He aimed for the escape road at the end of the straight, not realising it was blocked by a sandbank, which he hit at about 190&nbsp;km/h (120&nbsp;mph). Taken with critical injuries to the American military hospital at [[Orl\u00e9ans]], he died five days later.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.210-3\"/><ref name=\"Fox 1973, p.198\"/><ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.235\"/>\n\nA notable absentee at the test weekend was the Ferrari works team.<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.6-7\"/><ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.235\"/> Chris Amon was fastest at the test weekend in the experimental [[Ford GT40#J-car|Ford J-car]] with a 3:34.4 lap.<ref name=\"Moity 1974, p.102-4\"/> But come race-week it was Gurney who put in the fastest qualifying lap of 3:30.6, a second faster than his stablemates Miles, Gardner and McLaren. Ginther was 5th in the fastest Ferrari with a 3:33.0, with Parkes and Bandini in 7th and 8th respectively. Phil Hill, in the Chaparral, broke up the Ford-Ferrari procession in 10th.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.235\">Spurring 2010, p.235</ref>\n\nJo Siffert put the quickest Porsche 22nd on the grid with 3:51.0, with Nino Vaccarella's Ferrari in 24th (3:53.5) and Jo Schlesser's Matra just behind it (3:53.5). Over the test weekend, Mauro Bianchi had surprised many in the 1-litre Alpine, going as fast as the 1959 Ferrari Testa Rossas.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.224\"/><ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.235\"/>\nThe quickest Alpine in practice was [[Pauli Toivonen|Toivonen]]/Jansson (4:20.1), well ahead of the best CD (Ogier/Laurent 4:27.5) and the Austin-Healey's (4:45.1) and ASAs (4:49.8).<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.235\"/>\n\nThere were also two significant dramas in practice. The biggest news was the walkout of Ferrari's lead driver [[John Surtees]]. He and team manager Eugenio Dragoni had decided that he, as the fastest Ferrari driver and driving with [[Mike Parkes]], would act as the hare to bait and break the Fords. He was also still recovering from a big accident the previous year and would hand over to Scarfiotti if he got overly tired. Yet during raceweek, with news that new FIAT chairman [[Gianni Agnelli]] would be at the race, Dragoni changed the plan, putting Scarfiotti (Agnelli's nephew) in first. Surtees was furious and stormed off to Maranello to argue his case with [[Enzo Ferrari]].<ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.235\"/> Not listened to, Surtees, Ferrari's [[1964 Formula One season|1964 F1 World Champion]], quit the team.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.217-9\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.9\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.24\"/>\n\nThe second incident was more serious \u2013 Dick Thompson in the Alan Mann Ford Mk II collided with Dick Holqvist who was going far slower in the Scuderia Bear Ford GT40 and pulled right in front of him at Maison Blanche.<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.9\"/> Holqvist spun off with heavy damage, while Thompson was able to get back to the pits. While repairing the damage, officials told the team that they were disqualified for Thompson leaving the scene of a major accident. Thompson was adamant he had advised pit officials, and in the hearing Ford's director of racing Leo Beebe threatened to withdraw all Fords. He was supported by [[Fritz Huschke von Hanstein|Huschke von Hanstein]] who was prepared to withdraw the Porsche team as well.<ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.235\"/> In the end, the car was reinstated though Thompson was banned. This still posed a problem for Ford as they were lacking spare drivers, with injuries with [[A.J. Foyt]], [[Jackie Stewart]] and [[Lloyd Ruby]].<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.9\"/> In the end Australian [[Brian Muir (racing driver)|Brian Muir]], who was in England was flown over to France.

McLaren was being delayed by his tyres going off, so the team quietly changed from Firestones to Goodyears.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.210-3\"/> After only 9 laps, Rindt's Ford blew its engine at the end of the Mulsanne straight, so there would be no consecutive win.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.214-5\"/> At the end of the first hour Fords were 1-2-3, with Gurney leading by 24 seconds from Graham Hill and Bucknum. Fourth, 20 seconds further back, was the first NART Ferrari, of Rodriguez. Meanwhile, Miles had been putting in extremely fast laps, breaking the lap record and getting back up to 5th place. Parkes was 6th ahead of Bonnier in the Chaparral who had already been lapped. Within another hour Miles and Hulme had taken the lead.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.208-9\">Spurring 2010, p.208-9</ref><ref name=\"Fox 1973, p.201\"/>\n\nAt 8pm, only the Miles and Gurney Fords and Rodiguez's Ferrari were on the lead lap (#64).<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.26\">Clarke 1997, p.26: Motor Jun25 1966</ref> At dusk it started to drizzle, reducing the power advantage of the big Fords, and allowing the Ferraris to keep in touch. The Fords were further delayed as a number chose to change brake pads early.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.208-9\"/> By then all three Dinos were out with mechanical issues, removing one threat to Porsche.<ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.235\"/> A major accident occurred when Jean-Claude Ogier's CD got loose on spilt oil at the Mulsanne kink and was hit hard side-on by Fran\u00e7ois Pasquier in the NART ASA. Both cars hit the wall and caught fire,  and Ogier was taken to the hospital with two broken arms.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.228\"/><ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.231\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.11\">Clarke 1997, p.11: Road & Track Sept 1966</ref>\n\n===Night===\nAfter 6 hours, heavy rain was pouring down. Ginther's NART Ferrari was leading from Parkes, chased by the Fords of Miles and Gurney on the same lap, McLaren a lap behind then Bandini and Andretti two laps back. But Andretti was soon sidelined with a blown headgasket, as was the Hill/Muir Ford which had broken its front suspension coming out of Arnage corner.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.210-3\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.12\">Clarke 1997, p.12: Road & Track Sept 1966</ref> As the rain eased, the Fords of Miles and Gurney retook the lead. Just before midnight Robert Buchet aquaplaned coming over the crest at the Dunlop Bridge and crashed the French Porsche.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.220-1\"/> The Chaparral had been running well initially, getting as high as 5th, until a broken alternator stopped them also just before midnight while running in 8th.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.227\"/>\n\nAnother heavy downpour at 12.30 contributed to a big accident in the Esses. Guichet had just spun his Ferrari in the rain and got away when Buchet arrived and crashed his Porsche. Then Schlesser's Matra ran into the CD of Georges Heligouin avoiding the accident. As the damage was being cleared, Scarfiotti crashed his P3 into the Matra and all four cars were wrecked, although only Scarfiotti was taken to hospital, with minor bruising.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.208-9\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.11\"/>\n\nDuring the night the Ferraris started to suffer from overheating. When the NART P3 retired from 4th with a broken gearbox at 3am, and the Filipinetti car of Mairesse/M\u00fcller from 5th an hour later, the Ferrari challenge was spent \u2013 there would be no privateer-saviours for the marque this year. At halfway the Ford Mk IIs held the top-4 places (Miles/Hulme, Gurney/Grant, McLaren/Amon, Bucknum/Hutcherson) with GT40s in 5-6-8: Essex, Filipinetti and Ford-France (Revson/Scott, Spoerry/Sutcliffe, Ligier/Grossman). Siffert/Davis were leading a train of Porsches in 7th and the nearest Ferrari was the Bandini/Guichet P3 limping in 12th. Ford told their cars to drop to 4-minute laps, but Gurney and Miles kept racing hard for the lead.<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.12\"/>\n\n===Morning===\nWhat could have been a procession was anything but for Ford. At 8 am, a pit-stop for the Filipinetti Ford running 5th spilled petrol on a rear tyre. On his out-lap Spoerry lost traction and spun at the Esses wrecking the car. The Ford-France and Essex cars had already retired with engine issues during the night.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.214-5\"/>\n\nAt 9am the Gurney/Grant car, which had been dicing for the lead with Miles & Hulme (against strict team orders), retired from 1st when the car blew a headgasket. That left Ford with only three Mk IIs left (albeit running 1-2-3) as all the GT40s had retired as well. Porsches now held the next five places and the two Ferrari GTs were 9th and 10th chased by the Alpines.\n\n===Finish and post-race===\nWith the field covered it was now that Leo Beebe, Ford racing director, contrived to stage a dead heat by having his two lead cars cross the line simultaneously.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/opinion/le-mans/look-back-1966-le-mans-24-hours|title=A look back at the 1966 Le Mans 24 Hours|date=2016-05-05|access-date=2016-09-02}}</ref> The ACO told him this would not be possible \u2014 given the staggered starting formation, the #2 car would have covered 20 metres further, and thus be the race winner.

Miles/Hulme were leading, followed by McLaren/Amon holding station on the same lap. The gold Bucknum/Hutcherson car was third, but twelve laps behind. Miles was told to ease off to allow McLaren to catch up with him. Just before 4pm, it started to drizzle again. As it turned out McLaren's #2 car crossed the finish line just ahead and was declared the winner. It was rumoured that Miles, upset about the team orders, lifted off to allow McLaren to finish a length ahead.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.210-3\"/><ref name=\"Fox 1973, p.202\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.13\">Clarke 1997, p.13: Road & Track Sept 1966</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.motorauthority.com/news/1104584_watch-the-story-of-the-controversy-behind-the-ford-gt40s-photo-finish-at-le-mans-in-1966|title=Watch the story of the controversy behind the Ford GT40's photo finish at Le Mans in 1966|access-date=2016-09-02}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailysportscar.com/2016/06/17/le-mans-1966-the-golden-mystery.html|title=Le Mans 1966: The Golden Mystery \u2013 dailysportscar.com|website=www.dailysportscar.com|access-date=2016-09-02}}</ref>\n\nAt their last pitstop, the 7th-placed Porsche of [[Peter Gregg (racing driver)|Peter Gregg]] and Sten Axelsson was stopped by engine problems. Gregg parked the car waiting for the last lap, but at 3.50pm he could not get it restarted and missed the formation finish. The other Porsches came in 4th to 7th led by Siffert/Davis, who also claimed the Index of Performance. The [[Rolf Stommelen|Stommelen]]/[[G\u00fcnter Klass|Klass]] car in 7th was the first, and only, Sports car to finish. Finally, the new 911 GT ran well and finished 14th starting a long record of success.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.220-1\"/>\n\nFour Alpines finished this year, 9-11-12-13, with that of Delageneste/Cheinisse from the Ecurie Savin-Calberson winning the Thermal Efficiency Index.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.224\"/> The final finisher was the little Mini Marcos. Formerly the object of laughter, it had become a crowd favourite running like clockwork. As car after car ran into trouble and dropped out, the little Marcos, by this time nicknamed 'la puce bleue' (the blue flea) wailed on. Despite finishing 26 laps behind the rest of the field.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.233\"/><ref name=\"Moity 1974, p.102-4\"/> the car eventually came home at an incredible 15th overall.\n\nIt had taken three attempts for Ford to win [[1965 Indianapolis 500|Indianapolis]] and the NASCAR Championship, and now it added the Le Mans 24 Hours. Chrysler had first entered in 1925, and after 41 years it was the first win for an American car.<ref name=\"Clausager 1982, p.147\"/> The official [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] press release, erroneously dated 7/5/1966, claims:  {{cquote|The McLaren-Amon and the Miles-Hulme cars were running within seconds of each other as the race neared its end, with the Bucknum-Hutcherson car hanging back as insurance. A decision was made in the Ford pits to have the cars finish side by side in what hopefully would be considered a dead heat. All three cars went over the finish in formation, but any chance for a dead heat disappeared when officials discovered a rule that in case of a tie, the car that had started further down the grid had travelled the farther distance. Since McLaren and Amon had started 60 feet behind Miles and Hulme, they were declared the winners. Both [[New Zealanders]] who now reside in England, it was the most important victory yet for the two youngsters. McLaren, who builds his own Formula and sports cars, is 28. Amon 22, is the youngest winner in the history of the event. It was a record shattering performance as the winning car covered more miles (3,009.3) at a faster speed (125.38 mph) than any previous entry. It demonstrated that production engines could compete with racing powerplants and that an American-built car could top Europe's best.<ref>[https://media.ford.com/content/dam/fordmedia/Europe/en/2016/06/Ford%201966%20Le%20Mans%20release.pdf]</ref>}} The Ford team's decision was a big disappointment for Ken Miles, who was aiming for the [[Endurance racing (motorsport)|'Endurance Racing]] Triple Crown'\u2014winning Daytona-Sebring-Le Mans\u2014as a reward for his investment in the GT40 development. \"I'm disappointed, of course, but what are you going to do about it.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/18408295/|title=20 Jun 1966, Page 11 - The Cumberland News at Newspapers.com|access-date=2016-07-02}}</ref> Beebe also later admitted he had been annoyed with Miles racing Gurney, disregarding team orders by potentially risking the cars\u2019 endurance.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.210-3\"/>  Two months later, Ken Miles was killed at [[Riverside International Raceway|Riverside]] while testing the next generation Ford GT40 J-Car, which became the MkIV that won Le Mans in 1967.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.210-3\"/><ref name=\"Fox 1973, p.202\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cobracountry.com/editorials/kenmiles/home.html|title=Ken Miles--an appreciation|website=www.cobracountry.com|access-date=2016-09-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303201829/http://www.cobracountry.com/editorials/kenmiles/home.html|archive-date=2016-03-03|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn a race of attrition it was fortunate the big teams brought such quantity \u2013 only 3 of the 13 Fords finished and only the two GTs finished from the 14 Ferraris entered. By contrast, 5 of the 7 Porsches finished (including their 911 in the GT class) as did four of the six Alpines, showing much better reliability. It was the first time that the 3000 miles/125&nbsp;mph mark had been exceeded.<ref name=\"Clausager 1982, p.147\"/>\n\nWith the bitter failure of Ferrari's 330 P3 mirroring the failure of the Ford prototypes the previous year (and with salt rubbed into the wound with Ford's formation finish), the \"Ford-Ferrari War\" moved into its climactic phase.  The Le Mans results boosted Ford over Ferrari for the [[1966 World Sportscar Championship#Manufacturers' Championship|1966 Manufacturers' Championship]].  Ford's answer to Ferrari's next weapon, the [[Ferrari P|330 P4]], was delayed by development problems, handing Ferrari a rematch with the Mk IIs that so dominated them at LeMans, at the 1967 [[Daytona 24 Hours]].  After a defective batch of transaxle shafts sank Ford's effort, Ferrari took a 1-2-3 finish with their new P4s and returned the favor of Ford's victory formation.  Ford's [[Ford GT40|Mark IV]] was ready in time for the [[12 Hours of Sebring]], where it won on its maiden outing.  Three more examples were produced and prepared for the Le Mans 24 Hours, while Ford's championship hopes rested on the older [[Ford GT40|GT40s]] and the new GT40-derived [[Mirage (race car)|Mirages]] to gain points in the intervening races.  After a disappointing showing at [[1000 km Monza|Monza]] a controversial denial of championship points from a Mirage win at the [[1000 km Spa|Spa]] event, Ford saw limited opportunity for taking the Manufacturers' title again and instead concentrated on a last hurrah at Le Mans, where the leading Mark IV, driven by Dan Gurney and A.J. Foyt, won handily.  Ferrari took the Manufacturers' title for 1967, edging up-and-coming Porsche by two points.\n\nThe Ford-Ferrari War was ended by new rules for 1968 that eliminated the P4s and Mark IVs from eligibility for the Sports Prototype class with a 3-litre engine capacity limit.  The GT40s met the production requirement and 5 litre limit for [[Homologation (motorsport)|homologation]] in the new [[Group 4 (racing)|Group 4]] class.  Ferrari found the production requirement for homologating the P4 under Group 4 daunting and withdrew from competition in the sport-racer classes.  Neither Ford nor Ferrari fielded a factory team for the Manufacturers' Championship that year; however, the [[John Wyer]] team running the Group 4 [[Ford GT40|GT40s]] brought home the title for Ford and in 1969 achieved wins with the GT40 at Sebring and Le Mans.  When Ferrari was able to enter a homologated car for 1970, the class they competed in was dominated by the [[Porsche 917]].\n\nSeveral cars of the original 24-hours race have survived and have been restored to their former glory. The crowd-pleasing Mini Marcos was club raced, rallied and hill climbed, road registered twice and repainted five times only to be stolen in the night of 30 October 1975 from beneath a flat in Paris. Three days earlier Marcos-boss Harold Dermott had made a deal to buy the car with the intention to restore it and put on museum display. Several people searched for the car ever since, but it was only found back in December 2016 in Portugal by Dutchman Jeroen Booij.\n\n== Legacy in popular culture ==\n=== ''Go Like Hell'' ===\nThe race became the subject of a 2009 book, detailing the race and the famous background rivalry between [[Enzo Ferrari]] and [[Henry Ford II]], by [[A.J.

I recall it was damp and we were running on intermediate Firestone tires and at 210\u2013220 mph [355 kmh] on the Mulsanne Straight, the tires were shedding tread. I took over from Bruce and he spoke to Firestone and they generously said we could switch to the Goodyears the other GT40s were running. Bruce said to me we had to drive the doors off the thing, so we did. There was a bit of history to that. We had both driven the first two 7.0-litre cars at Le Mans the previous year: Bruce with Ken Miles and myself with Phil Hill. We were warned to be careful with the gearbox as they were new and unproven, and both cars retired with gearbox failures. As a result, when I went to Daytona for the 24 hours, paired with Bruce, I suggested to Bruce that we set a fairly conservative pace for the race, and whilst we might be running out of the top three in the early stages, we might be the only one there at the end. We finished fifth. For Le Mans, we decided to set a pace for ourselves. This strategy fell apart when our tires started losing treads early in the race and we lost considerable time. When I was called in to change tires, I think Bruce's frustration had reached boiling point, he put his head through the car door and said 'Go like hell!'.\" At the finish: \"the idea was that the leading GT40s would cross the line together, but in practice, it wasn't possible to have a dead heat.

The following year, they won again. The year after that, they won a third time. And in 1969, a fourth.\n\nThat achievement was arguably the greatest in the company's history. It came after years of struggle, more than a few public failures, and enough burnt cash to refloat the ''Titanic. ''Ford's Sixties Le Mans program was famously the result of a dispute between Henry Ford II and Enzo Ferrari\u2013Ford had tried to purchase Ferrari (the company), only to have Enzo shut down the sale at the last minute. Ford the man vowed to get even, aiming his considerable resources at Ferrari's Le Mans record. The resulting warpath employed everyone from Bruce McLaren to Carroll Shelby and Indy 500 legend [[A. J. Foyt|A.J.

That first win made it onto the front pages of European newspapers, and it actually helped sell new cars. Ferrari never won Le Mans again, but Ford wouldn't go back until 2016. When [[2016 24 Hours of Le Mans|Dearborn won last year]], the world went less than nuts. But that makes sense: Both Le Mans and international motorsport are different now, tamer and less raw. So is the automobile itself. Racing is no longer a brutally dangerous pastime or the kind of thing that puts whole countries on the edge of their seats. And most of all, in 2016, there is no [[Henry Ford II|Henry the Deuce]], no world-altering grudge match, no Enzo, no Carroll.

GT cars were now [[Group 3 (racing)|Group 3]] and Prototypes were now [[Group 6 (racing)|Group 6]]. Two new classes for Sports Cars were [[Group 4 (racing)|Group 4]] and [[Group 5 (racing)|Group 5]] for \u2018Special Sports Cars\u2019 (Group 1 and 2 covered Touring Cars, [[Group 7 (racing)|Group 7]] led to the [[1966 Can-Am season|Can-Am series]], with Group 8 and 9 for single-seaters).<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.208\">Spurring 2010, p.208</ref>\n\nAs Group 7 were ineligible for FIA events, the [[Automobile Club de l'Ouest]] (ACO) opened its entry list to Group 3, 4 and 6. The FIA mandated minimum annual production runs of 500 cars for Group 3 (up from 100 previously<ref name=\"Clausager 1982, p.140\">Clausager 1982, p.140</ref><ref name=\"Moity 1974, p.102-4\">Moity 1974, p.102-4</ref>) and 50 for Group 4,<ref name=\"Moity 1974, p.102-4\"/>  which also had a maximum engine capacity of 5000cc. There were no engine limits on the GTs or Prototypes. As before, the Groups were split up in classes based on engine size, there was a sliding scale of a minimum weight based on the increasing engine size (from 450 to 1000&nbsp;kg for 500 to 7000cc) as was fuel-tank capacity (60 to 160 litres).<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.208\"/>\n\nAlong with the new Appendix J, after four years of focus on GT racing the FIA announced the International Manufacturer's Championship, for Group 6 Prototypes (2L / >2L), and the International Sports Car Championship for Group 4 (1.3L / 2L / 5L).<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.208\"/>\n\n==Entries==\n[[File:Ford GT40 Mark II at Goodwood Revival 2013 001.jpg|left|thumb|[[Ford GT40]] Mark II ]]\n[[File:Ferrari-330p3-2.jpg|left|thumb|[[Ferrari 330 P3]]]]\n[[File:Porsche 906 Tour Auto 2014 Circuit de Dijon Prenois 03.jpg|left|thumb|Porsche 906 Carrera]]\nWith the new regulations this year the ACO received a huge 103 entry requests.

Extensive work was done in the wind tunnel, and improving the brakes, handling and engine \u2013 not least improving the fuel economy.<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.6-7\">Clarke 1997, p.6-7: Autosport Jun17 1966</ref><ref name=\"Fox 1973, p.201\">Fox 1973, p.201</ref><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.18\">Clarke 1997, p.18: Road & Track Oct 1966</ref><ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.209\">Armstrong 1966, p.209</ref> The big 7-litre engine now put out 475&nbsp;bhp.<ref name=\"Moity 1974, p.102-4\"/> But the new year started with promise with [[Ken Miles]] and [[Lloyd Ruby]] winning both the inaugural [[24 Hours of Daytona]] and then [[12 Hours of Sebring]].<ref name=\"Fox 1973, p.201\"/> Copying Ferrari's tactic of overwhelming numbers, they put in fifteen Mark II entrants; eight were accepted by the ACO. This time six were built and prepared by [[Carroll Shelby International|Shelby American]]. Shelby ran three cars himself for Americans [[Dan Gurney]] and [[Jerry Grant]], Miles was now paired with New Zealander [[Denny Hulme]] after Ruby had been injured in a plane crash a month earlier.<ref name=\"Fox 1973, p.198\">Fox 1973, p.198</ref> The third car was the all-[[Kiwi (people)|Kiwi]] pairing of [[Bruce McLaren]] and [[Chris Amon]]. [[Holman Moody|Holman & Moody]], the successful Ford NASCAR race team was brought on board to race another trio \u2013 for [[Mark Donohue]]/[[Paul Hawkins (racing driver)|Paul Hawkins]], [[Ronnie Bucknum]]/[[Dick Hutcherson]], and [[Lucien Bianchi]]/[[Mario Andretti]].<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.15\">Clarke 1997, p.15: Road & Track Oct 1966</ref> One of the big improvements Holman & Moody brought with them was a quick-change brakepad system to save time in the pits.<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.21\">Clarke 1997, p.21: Road & Track Oct 1966</ref>\n\nThe British team [[Alan Mann Racing]] had two cars prepared by Ford Advanced Vehicles, for [[Graham Hill]]/[[Dick Thompson (racing driver)|Dick Thompson]] and [[John Whitmore (racing driver)|John Whitmore]]/[[Frank Gardner (racing driver)|Frank Gardner]]. Each of the eight cars was painted in a colour from the [[Ford Mustang (first generation)|Mustang]] road-car range.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.210-3\">Spurring 2010, p.210-3</ref><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.10\">Clarke 1997, p.10: Road & Track Sept 1966</ref>\n\nFerrari's response to the Mk II was the new [[Ferrari P#330 P3|Ferrari 330 P3]]. Shorter and wider than the P2, it kept the same 4-litre engine but with fuel-injection now put out 420&nbsp;bhp.<ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.209\"/> The works team had a pair of closed-cockpit versions for [[John Surtees]]/[[Ludovico Scarfiotti]] and former winners [[Lorenzo Bandini]]/[[Jean Guichet]]. An open-cockpit variant was given to the [[North American Racing Team]] (NART) for [[Pedro Rodriguez (racing driver)|Pedro Rodriguez]]/[[Richie Ginther]]. But their race preparation had been limited by strike action in Italy.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.217-9\">Spurring 2010, p.217-9</ref><ref name=\"Fox 1973, p.201\"/><ref name=\"Laban 2001, p.150-1\">Laban 2001, p.150-1</ref>\n\nNART also entered a long-tailed P2, rebodied by [[Piero Drogo]] and driven by last year's winner [[Masten Gregory]] with [[Bob Bondurant]]. There were also P2/P3 hybrids for the [[Ecurie Francorchamps]] (Dumay/\"Beurlys\") and [[Scuderia Filipinetti]] ([[Willy Mairesse|Mairesse]]/[[Herbert M\u00fcller (racing driver)|M\u00fcller]]. Finally there was a P2 Spyder for Maranello Concessionaires ([[Richard Attwood|Attwood]]/[[David Piper (racing driver)|Piper]]).<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.217-9\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.9\">Clarke 1997, p.9: Road & Track Sept 1966</ref> Fighting on two fronts, the company also took on Porsche in the 2-litre class with its [[Dino 206 S]] with a pair from NART and another for Maranello. [[Nino Vaccarella]], race winner in [[1964 24 Hours of Le Mans|1964]], was furious when he found out he was \u2018demoted\u2019 to drive the Dino rather than the P3 and threatened to walk out, but did, in the end run the car.<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.24\">Clarke 1997, p.24: Motor Jun25 1966</ref><ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.235\">Armstrong 1966, p.235</ref>\n\nChevrolet was the other player in the over 2-litre class. Ex-Ferrari engineer [[Giotto Bizzarrini]] had fallen out with [[Renzo Rivolta]] and with his own company brought his new design, the P538, but still using the 5.3L Chevrolet engine. The other Chevy was in Texan [[Jim Hall (racing driver)|Jim Hall]]\u2019s [[Chaparral Cars#2|Chaparral 2D]]. The 5.3L small block put out 420&nbsp;bhp and had a semi-automatic transmission.<ref name=\"Laban 2001, p.150-1\"/><ref name=\"Moity 1974, p.102-4\"/> Driven by [[Phil Hill]] and [[Jo Bonnier]], they made a big impact winning the N\u00fcrburgring round just two weeks earlier.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.227\">Spurring 2010, p.227</ref>\n\nPorsche came with a new model \u2013 the [[Porsche 906|906]] designed by the team led by [[Ferdinand Pi\u00ebch]]. With the 2.0L flat-6 engine from the 911, it had recently been homologated for Group 4 with the requisite 50 cars.<ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.210\">Armstrong 1966, p.210</ref> It was race-proven too, after winning the [[Targa Florio]] the month before. However three ''langheck'' (long-tail) prototypes were also entered by the works team, driven by [[Hans Herrmann]]/[[Herbert Linge]], [[Jo Siffert]]/[[Colin Davis (racing driver)|Colin Davis]] and [[Udo Sch\u00fctz]]/[[Peter de Klerk]].<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.220-1\">Spurring 2010, p.220-1</ref>\n\nAlfa Romeo, and its works team [[Autodelta]], had withdrawn from racing for a year to prepare a new car for 1967.<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.6-7\"/> But this year, a significant new manufacturer entered the fray: [[Matra]] had bought out [[Automobiles Ren\u00e9 Bonnet]] in 1964, rebadging the [[Matra Djet|Djet]]. However it was a new design that was entered. The M620 had a 2-litre version of the BRM Formula 1 engine developing 245&nbsp;bhp that could match the Porsches in speed, making 275&nbsp;kp/h (170&nbsp;mph). The three cars were driven by up and coming young French single-seater drivers [[Jean-Pierre Beltoise]]/[[Johnny Servoz-Gavin]], [[Jean-Pierre Jaussaud]]/[[Henri Pescarolo]] and [[Jo Schlesser]] with Welshman [[Alan Rees (racing driver)|Alan Rees]].<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.222\">Spurring 2010, p.222</ref>\n\nRemarkably, given British dominance of the race barely a decade earlier, there were only three British cars in this year's race. Defending class-champions Austin-Healey had two works entries. The other was a [[Marcos Engineering]] kit-car based on a Mini Cooper 'S' chassis. Entered by Frenchman Hubert Giraud and driven by Jean-Louis Marnat and Claude Ballot-Lena, the team was able to get a works engine and gearbox from [[British Motor Corporation|BMC]]. The spectators laughed at the small car and its apparent resemblance to a flea.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.233\">Spurring 2010, p.233</ref> But the Mini Marcos would became the 'darling of the crowds' later on in the race.\n\nAlpine, after its poor showing in the previous year, returned with 6 cars. The new A210 had a 1.3L Gordini-Renault engine with a Porsche gearbox making it more durable if only a little faster at 245&nbsp;kp/h (150&nbsp;mph). This year a new customer team, the Ecurie Savin-Calberson was supported by Alpine, with former Index winner Roger Delageneste.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.224\">Spurring 2010, p.224</ref>\n\n[[Charles Deutsch]] (CD) brought his new aerodynamic SP66. The car was powered by a 1130cc Peugeot engine, marking the return of the French company last seen in the 1938 race.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.231\">Spurring 2010, p.231</ref> Another competitor in the small prototypes was [[ASA (automobile)|ASA]]. Originally a Ferrari design by [[Carlo Chiti]] and [[Giotto Bizzarrini]] before their famous [[History of Ferrari#1961 \u2013 The great walkout|walk-out from Ferrari]], it was sold to the new Italian company and uprated with a 1290cc engine giving 125&nbsp;bhp. Two cars were entered, one by ASA and one by NART.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.228\">Spurring 2010, p.228</ref>\n\nThe new Group 4 category started attracting interest as the earlier prototypes were meeting the homologation and production requirements. There were six GT40s entered by customer teams, with the 4.7L engine. [[Jochen Rindt]], the previous year's winner, had moved across from Ferrari to Ford, in the new Canadian Comstock Racing Team. They joined Ford France, Scuderia Filipinetti and new privateers Scuderia Bear and [[Superior Essex|Essex Wire]]. Joining Skip Scott, team owner of the Essex Wire team, was a 21-year old [[Jacky Ickx]] in his Le Mans debut.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.214-5\">Spurring 2010, p.214-5</ref><ref name=\"Clausager 1982, p.147\">Clausager 1982, p.147</ref>\n\nUp against them was [[Ed Hugus]]\u2019 modified Ferrari 275 GTB and the [[Ecurie Nationale Belge|Equipe Nationale Belge]] ran its 250 LM. Porsche also ran three regular 906s in the Sports category, two works entries as well as one for their Paris importer Toto Veuillet.\n\nWith Shelby now fully concentrated on the Ford program, the Cobra GTs were abandoned. There were only three GT entries: the Ferrari customer teams Ecurie Francorchamps and Maranello Concessionaires both entered a 275 GTB. The third was a quiet though significant entry: Jacques Dewes, ever the pioneering privateer, brought the first Porsche 911 to Le Mans. Production of what would become the ubiquitous Le Mans car had started in late 1964 and the new 911 S model had its \u2018boxer\u2019 6-cylinder engine tuned to 160&nbsp;bhp.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.223\">Spurring 2010, p.223</ref>\n\nFinally, in a subcompetition of its own, there was the tire race between [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]], [[Dunlop Tyres|Dunlop]], and [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]].<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.6-7\"/>\n\n==Practice==\nOnce again there was rain at the April testing weekend. And once again there was tragedy with a fatal accident. American Walt Hansgen's Ford hit water on the pit straight and aquaplaned. He aimed for the escape road at the end of the straight, not realising it was blocked by a sandbank, which he hit at about 190&nbsp;km/h (120&nbsp;mph). Taken with critical injuries to the American military hospital at [[Orl\u00e9ans]], he died five days later.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.210-3\"/><ref name=\"Fox 1973, p.198\"/><ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.235\"/>\n\nA notable absentee at the test weekend was the Ferrari works team.<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.6-7\"/><ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.235\"/> Chris Amon was fastest at the test weekend in the experimental [[Ford GT40#J-car|Ford J-car]] with a 3:34.4 lap.<ref name=\"Moity 1974, p.102-4\"/> But come race-week it was Gurney who put in the fastest qualifying lap of 3:30.6, a second faster than his stablemates Miles, Gardner and McLaren. Ginther was 5th in the fastest Ferrari with a 3:33.0, with Parkes and Bandini in 7th and 8th respectively. Phil Hill, in the Chaparral, broke up the Ford-Ferrari procession in 10th.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.235\">Spurring 2010, p.235</ref>\n\nJo Siffert put the quickest Porsche 22nd on the grid with 3:51.0, with Nino Vaccarella's Ferrari in 24th (3:53.5) and Jo Schlesser's Matra just behind it (3:53.5). Over the test weekend, Mauro Bianchi had surprised many in the 1-litre Alpine, going as fast as the 1959 Ferrari Testa Rossas.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.224\"/><ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.235\"/>\nThe quickest Alpine in practice was [[Pauli Toivonen|Toivonen]]/Jansson (4:20.1), well ahead of the best CD (Ogier/Laurent 4:27.5) and the Austin-Healey's (4:45.1) and ASAs (4:49.8).<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.235\"/>\n\nThere were also two significant dramas in practice. The biggest news was the walkout of Ferrari's lead driver [[John Surtees]]. He and team manager Eugenio Dragoni had decided that he, as the fastest Ferrari driver and driving with [[Mike Parkes]], would act as the hare to bait and break the Fords. He was also still recovering from a big accident the previous year and would hand over to Scarfiotti if he got overly tired. Yet during raceweek, with news that new FIAT chairman [[Gianni Agnelli]] would be at the race, Dragoni changed the plan, putting Scarfiotti (Agnelli's nephew) in first. Surtees was furious and stormed off to Maranello to argue his case with [[Enzo Ferrari]].<ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.235\"/> Not listened to, Surtees, Ferrari's [[1964 Formula One season|1964 F1 World Champion]], quit the team.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.217-9\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.9\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.24\"/>\n\nThe second incident was more serious \u2013 Dick Thompson in the Alan Mann Ford Mk II collided with Dick Holqvist who was going far slower in the Scuderia Bear Ford GT40 and pulled right in front of him at Maison Blanche.<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.9\"/> Holqvist spun off with heavy damage, while Thompson was able to get back to the pits. While repairing the damage, officials told the team that they were disqualified for Thompson leaving the scene of a major accident. Thompson was adamant he had advised pit officials, and in the hearing Ford's director of racing Leo Beebe threatened to withdraw all Fords. He was supported by [[Fritz Huschke von Hanstein|Huschke von Hanstein]] who was prepared to withdraw the Porsche team as well.<ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.235\"/> In the end, the car was reinstated though Thompson was banned. This still posed a problem for Ford as they were lacking spare drivers, with injuries with [[A.J. Foyt]], [[Jackie Stewart]] and [[Lloyd Ruby]].<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.9\"/> In the end Australian [[Brian Muir (racing driver)|Brian Muir]], who was in England was flown over to France. He did his two laps, his first ever at Le Mans on raceday morning to qualify.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.214-5\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.10\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.24\"/>\n\n==Race==\n===Start===\nOn a cool and cloudy afternoon, it was [[Henry Ford II]] this year who was the honorary starter.<ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.235\"/> Last minute raindrops caused a flurry of tyre changes and some cars switched from Firestone to Goodyear or Dunlop.<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.10\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.24\"/> At the end of the first lap Ford's cars led \u2013 Hill ahead of Gurney then Bucknum, Parkes in the Ferrari, followed by Whitmore's Ford, the Chaparral, then the GT40s of Scott and Rindt.<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.10\"/> There had been instant excitement when Edgar Berney spun his Bizzarrini on the start-line amongst the crowd of departing cars.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.232\">Spurring 2010, p.232</ref><ref name=\"Clausager 1982, p.144\">Clausager 1982, p.144</ref><ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.235\"/> Miles had to pit after the first lap to fix his door after colliding with Whitmore's Ford at the start.<ref name=\"Fox 1973, p.201\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.10\"/> Also pitting on the first lap was Paul Hawkins whose Ford broke a halfshaft going down the [[Mulsanne Straight]] lurching him sideways at nearly 350&nbsp;km/h.<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.10\"/> The Holman & Moody crew took 70 minutes to repair it only for Mark Donohue to have the rear boot blow off down the Mulsanne and find the differential had been terminally damaged.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.210-3\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.10\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.25\">Clarke 1997, p.25: Motor Jun25 1966</ref>\n\nOn the third lap Gurney took the lead, which he held onto until the first pit-stops. McLaren was being delayed by his tyres going off, so the team quietly changed from Firestones to Goodyears.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.210-3\"/> After only 9 laps, Rindt's Ford blew its engine at the end of the Mulsanne straight, so there would be no consecutive win.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.214-5\"/> At the end of the first hour Fords were 1-2-3, with Gurney leading by 24 seconds from Graham Hill and Bucknum. Fourth, 20 seconds further back, was the first NART Ferrari, of Rodriguez. Meanwhile, Miles had been putting in extremely fast laps, breaking the lap record and getting back up to 5th place. Parkes was 6th ahead of Bonnier in the Chaparral who had already been lapped. Within another hour Miles and Hulme had taken the lead.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.208-9\">Spurring 2010, p.208-9</ref><ref name=\"Fox 1973, p.201\"/>\n\nAt 8pm, only the Miles and Gurney Fords and Rodiguez's Ferrari were on the lead lap (#64).<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.26\">Clarke 1997, p.26: Motor Jun25 1966</ref> At dusk it started to drizzle, reducing the power advantage of the big Fords, and allowing the Ferraris to keep in touch. The Fords were further delayed as a number chose to change brake pads early.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.208-9\"/> By then all three Dinos were out with mechanical issues, removing one threat to Porsche.<ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.235\"/> A major accident occurred when Jean-Claude Ogier's CD got loose on spilt oil at the Mulsanne kink and was hit hard side-on by Fran\u00e7ois Pasquier in the NART ASA. Both cars hit the wall and caught fire,  and Ogier was taken to the hospital with two broken arms.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.228\"/><ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.231\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.11\">Clarke 1997, p.11: Road & Track Sept 1966</ref>\n\n===Night===\nAfter 6 hours, heavy rain was pouring down. Ginther's NART Ferrari was leading from Parkes, chased by the Fords of Miles and Gurney on the same lap, McLaren a lap behind then Bandini and Andretti two laps back. But Andretti was soon sidelined with a blown headgasket, as was the Hill/Muir Ford which had broken its front suspension coming out of Arnage corner.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.210-3\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.12\">Clarke 1997, p.12: Road & Track Sept 1966</ref> As the rain eased, the Fords of Miles and Gurney retook the lead. Just before midnight Robert Buchet aquaplaned coming over the crest at the Dunlop Bridge and crashed the French Porsche.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.220-1\"/> The Chaparral had been running well initially, getting as high as 5th, until a broken alternator stopped them also just before midnight while running in 8th.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.227\"/>\n\nAnother heavy downpour at 12.30 contributed to a big accident in the Esses. Guichet had just spun his Ferrari in the rain and got away when Buchet arrived and crashed his Porsche. Then Schlesser's Matra ran into the CD of Georges Heligouin avoiding the accident. As the damage was being cleared, Scarfiotti crashed his P3 into the Matra and all four cars were wrecked, although only Scarfiotti was taken to hospital, with minor bruising.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.208-9\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.11\"/>\n\nDuring the night the Ferraris started to suffer from overheating. When the NART P3 retired from 4th with a broken gearbox at 3am, and the Filipinetti car of Mairesse/M\u00fcller from 5th an hour later, the Ferrari challenge was spent \u2013 there would be no privateer-saviours for the marque this year. At halfway the Ford Mk IIs held the top-4 places (Miles/Hulme, Gurney/Grant, McLaren/Amon, Bucknum/Hutcherson) with GT40s in 5-6-8: Essex, Filipinetti and Ford-France (Revson/Scott, Spoerry/Sutcliffe, Ligier/Grossman). Siffert/Davis were leading a train of Porsches in 7th and the nearest Ferrari was the Bandini/Guichet P3 limping in 12th. Ford told their cars to drop to 4-minute laps, but Gurney and Miles kept racing hard for the lead.<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.12\"/>\n\n===Morning===\nWhat could have been a procession was anything but for Ford. At 8 am, a pit-stop for the Filipinetti Ford running 5th spilled petrol on a rear tyre. On his out-lap Spoerry lost traction and spun at the Esses wrecking the car. The Ford-France and Essex cars had already retired with engine issues during the night.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.214-5\"/>\n\nAt 9am the Gurney/Grant car, which had been dicing for the lead with Miles & Hulme (against strict team orders), retired from 1st when the car blew a headgasket. That left Ford with only three Mk IIs left (albeit running 1-2-3) as all the GT40s had retired as well. Porsches now held the next five places and the two Ferrari GTs were 9th and 10th chased by the Alpines.\n\n===Finish and post-race===\nWith the field covered it was now that Leo Beebe, Ford racing director, contrived to stage a dead heat by having his two lead cars cross the line simultaneously.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/opinion/le-mans/look-back-1966-le-mans-24-hours|title=A look back at the 1966 Le Mans 24 Hours|date=2016-05-05|access-date=2016-09-02}}</ref> The ACO told him this would not be possible \u2014 given the staggered starting formation, the #2 car would have covered 20 metres further, and thus be the race winner. But Beebe pushed on with his plan anyway.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.208-9\"/><ref name=\"Fox 1973, p.202\">Fox 1973, p.202</ref>\n\nAt the last pit stop, the Mark IIs were still in front. Miles/Hulme were leading, followed by McLaren/Amon holding station on the same lap. The gold Bucknum/Hutcherson car was third, but twelve laps behind. Miles was told to ease off to allow McLaren to catch up with him. Just before 4pm, it started to drizzle again. As it turned out McLaren's #2 car crossed the finish line just ahead and was declared the winner. It was rumoured that Miles, upset about the team orders, lifted off to allow McLaren to finish a length ahead.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.210-3\"/><ref name=\"Fox 1973, p.202\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.13\">Clarke 1997, p.13: Road & Track Sept 1966</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.motorauthority.com/news/1104584_watch-the-story-of-the-controversy-behind-the-ford-gt40s-photo-finish-at-le-mans-in-1966|title=Watch the story of the controversy behind the Ford GT40's photo finish at Le Mans in 1966|access-date=2016-09-02}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailysportscar.com/2016/06/17/le-mans-1966-the-golden-mystery.html|title=Le Mans 1966: The Golden Mystery \u2013 dailysportscar.com|website=www.dailysportscar.com|access-date=2016-09-02}}</ref>\n\nAt their last pitstop, the 7th-placed Porsche of [[Peter Gregg (racing driver)|Peter Gregg]] and Sten Axelsson was stopped by engine problems. Gregg parked the car waiting for the last lap, but at 3.50pm he could not get it restarted and missed the formation finish. The other Porsches came in 4th to 7th led by Siffert/Davis, who also claimed the Index of Performance. The [[Rolf Stommelen|Stommelen]]/[[G\u00fcnter Klass|Klass]] car in 7th was the first, and only, Sports car to finish. Finally, the new 911 GT ran well and finished 14th starting a long record of success.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.220-1\"/>\n\nFour Alpines finished this year, 9-11-12-13, with that of Delageneste/Cheinisse from the Ecurie Savin-Calberson winning the Thermal Efficiency Index.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.224\"/> The final finisher was the little Mini Marcos. Formerly the object of laughter, it had become a crowd favourite running like clockwork. As car after car ran into trouble and dropped out, the little Marcos, by this time nicknamed 'la puce bleue' (the blue flea) wailed on. Despite finishing 26 laps behind the rest of the field.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.233\"/><ref name=\"Moity 1974, p.102-4\"/> the car eventually came home at an incredible 15th overall.\n\nIt had taken three attempts for Ford to win [[1965 Indianapolis 500|Indianapolis]] and the NASCAR Championship, and now it added the Le Mans 24 Hours. Chrysler had first entered in 1925, and after 41 years it was the first win for an American car.<ref name=\"Clausager 1982, p.147\"/> The official [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] press release, erroneously dated 7/5/1966, claims:  {{cquote|The McLaren-Amon and the Miles-Hulme cars were running within seconds of each other as the race neared its end, with the Bucknum-Hutcherson car hanging back as insurance. A decision was made in the Ford pits to have the cars finish side by side in what hopefully would be considered a dead heat. All three cars went over the finish in formation, but any chance for a dead heat disappeared when officials discovered a rule that in case of a tie, the car that had started further down the grid had travelled the farther distance. Since McLaren and Amon had started 60 feet behind Miles and Hulme, they were declared the winners. Both [[New Zealanders]] who now reside in England, it was the most important victory yet for the two youngsters. McLaren, who builds his own Formula and sports cars, is 28. Amon 22, is the youngest winner in the history of the event. It was a record shattering performance as the winning car covered more miles (3,009.3) at a faster speed (125.38 mph) than any previous entry. It demonstrated that production engines could compete with racing powerplants and that an American-built car could top Europe's best.<ref>[https://media.ford.com/content/dam/fordmedia/Europe/en/2016/06/Ford%201966%20Le%20Mans%20release.pdf]</ref>}} The Ford team's decision was a big disappointment for Ken Miles, who was aiming for the [[Endurance racing (motorsport)|'Endurance Racing]] Triple Crown'\u2014winning Daytona-Sebring-Le Mans\u2014as a reward for his investment in the GT40 development. \"I'm disappointed, of course, but what are you going to do about it.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/18408295/|title=20 Jun 1966, Page 11 - The Cumberland News at Newspapers.com|access-date=2016-07-02}}</ref> Beebe also later admitted he had been annoyed with Miles racing Gurney, disregarding team orders by potentially risking the cars\u2019 endurance.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.210-3\"/>  Two months later, Ken Miles was killed at [[Riverside International Raceway|Riverside]] while testing the next generation Ford GT40 J-Car, which became the MkIV that won Le Mans in 1967.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.210-3\"/><ref name=\"Fox 1973, p.202\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cobracountry.com/editorials/kenmiles/home.html|title=Ken Miles--an appreciation|website=www.cobracountry.com|access-date=2016-09-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303201829/http://www.cobracountry.com/editorials/kenmiles/home.html|archive-date=2016-03-03|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn a race of attrition it was fortunate the big teams brought such quantity \u2013 only 3 of the 13 Fords finished and only the two GTs finished from the 14 Ferraris entered. By contrast, 5 of the 7 Porsches finished (including their 911 in the GT class) as did four of the six Alpines, showing much better reliability. It was the first time that the 3000 miles/125&nbsp;mph mark had been exceeded.<ref name=\"Clausager 1982, p.147\"/>\n\nWith the bitter failure of Ferrari's 330 P3 mirroring the failure of the Ford prototypes the previous year (and with salt rubbed into the wound with Ford's formation finish), the \"Ford-Ferrari War\" moved into its climactic phase.  The Le Mans results boosted Ford over Ferrari for the [[1966 World Sportscar Championship#Manufacturers' Championship|1966 Manufacturers' Championship]].  Ford's answer to Ferrari's next weapon, the [[Ferrari P|330 P4]], was delayed by development problems, handing Ferrari a rematch with the Mk IIs that so dominated them at LeMans, at the 1967 [[Daytona 24 Hours]].  After a defective batch of transaxle shafts sank Ford's effort, Ferrari took a 1-2-3 finish with their new P4s and returned the favor of Ford's victory formation.  Ford's [[Ford GT40|Mark IV]] was ready in time for the [[12 Hours of Sebring]], where it won on its maiden outing.  Three more examples were produced and prepared for the Le Mans 24 Hours, while Ford's championship hopes rested on the older [[Ford GT40|GT40s]] and the new GT40-derived [[Mirage (race car)|Mirages]] to gain points in the intervening races.  After a disappointing showing at [[1000 km Monza|Monza]] a controversial denial of championship points from a Mirage win at the [[1000 km Spa|Spa]] event, Ford saw limited opportunity for taking the Manufacturers' title again and instead concentrated on a last hurrah at Le Mans, where the leading Mark IV, driven by Dan Gurney and A.J. Foyt, won handily.  Ferrari took the Manufacturers' title for 1967, edging up-and-coming Porsche by two points.\n\nThe Ford-Ferrari War was ended by new rules for 1968 that eliminated the P4s and Mark IVs from eligibility for the Sports Prototype class with a 3-litre engine capacity limit.  The GT40s met the production requirement and 5 litre limit for [[Homologation (motorsport)|homologation]] in the new [[Group 4 (racing)|Group 4]] class.  Ferrari found the production requirement for homologating the P4 under Group 4 daunting and withdrew from competition in the sport-racer classes.  Neither Ford nor Ferrari fielded a factory team for the Manufacturers' Championship that year; however, the [[John Wyer]] team running the Group 4 [[Ford GT40|GT40s]] brought home the title for Ford and in 1969 achieved wins with the GT40 at Sebring and Le Mans.  When Ferrari was able to enter a homologated car for 1970, the class they competed in was dominated by the [[Porsche 917]].\n\nSeveral cars of the original 24-hours race have survived and have been restored to their former glory. The crowd-pleasing Mini Marcos was club raced, rallied and hill climbed, road registered twice and repainted five times only to be stolen in the night of 30 October 1975 from beneath a flat in Paris. Three days earlier Marcos-boss Harold Dermott had made a deal to buy the car with the intention to restore it and put on museum display. Several people searched for the car ever since, but it was only found back in December 2016 in Portugal by Dutchman Jeroen Booij.\n\n== Legacy in popular culture ==\n=== ''Go Like Hell'' ===\nThe race became the subject of a 2009 book, detailing the race and the famous background rivalry between [[Enzo Ferrari]] and [[Henry Ford II]], by [[A.J.

I recall it was damp and we were running on intermediate Firestone tires and at 210\u2013220 mph [355 kmh] on the Mulsanne Straight, the tires were shedding tread. I took over from Bruce and he spoke to Firestone and they generously said we could switch to the Goodyears the other GT40s were running. Bruce said to me we had to drive the doors off the thing, so we did. There was a bit of history to that. We had both driven the first two 7.0-litre cars at Le Mans the previous year: Bruce with Ken Miles and myself with Phil Hill. We were warned to be careful with the gearbox as they were new and unproven, and both cars retired with gearbox failures. As a result, when I went to Daytona for the 24 hours, paired with Bruce, I suggested to Bruce that we set a fairly conservative pace for the race, and whilst we might be running out of the top three in the early stages, we might be the only one there at the end. We finished fifth. For Le Mans, we decided to set a pace for ourselves. This strategy fell apart when our tires started losing treads early in the race and we lost considerable time.

The following year, they won again. The year after that, they won a third time. And in 1969, a fourth.\n\nThat achievement was arguably the greatest in the company's history. It came after years of struggle, more than a few public failures, and enough burnt cash to refloat the ''Titanic. ''Ford's Sixties Le Mans program was famously the result of a dispute between Henry Ford II and Enzo Ferrari\u2013Ford had tried to purchase Ferrari (the company), only to have Enzo shut down the sale at the last minute. Ford the man vowed to get even, aiming his considerable resources at Ferrari's Le Mans record. The resulting warpath employed everyone from Bruce McLaren to Carroll Shelby and Indy 500 legend [[A. J. Foyt|A.J. Foyt]], putting the stops to Ferrari's unbroken, five-year winning streak at La Sarthe.\n\nCollectively, Ford's wins were one of countless bright moments in a golden decade for both motorsport and [[Popular culture|culture]] in general. That first win made it onto the front pages of European newspapers, and it actually helped sell new cars. Ferrari never won Le Mans again, but Ford wouldn't go back until 2016. When [[2016 24 Hours of Le Mans|Dearborn won last year]], the world went less than nuts. But that makes sense: Both Le Mans and international motorsport are different now, tamer and less raw. So is the automobile itself. Racing is no longer a brutally dangerous pastime or the kind of thing that puts whole countries on the edge of their seats. And most of all, in 2016, there is no [[Henry Ford II|Henry the Deuce]], no world-altering grudge match, no Enzo, no Carroll. The Ford-Ferrari war pivoted on how these men operated and thought, and they made that story what it was.\" Sam Smith, ''Adam Carolla's 'The 24 Hour War' Is a Car Movie by Car People That Isn't Just for Car People'', [[Road & Track|Road and Track]], Jan. 18, 2017.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/entertainment/a32330/film-review-adam-carollas-the-24-hour-war/|title=Adam Carolla's 'The 24 Hour War' Is a Car Movie by Car People That Isn't Just for Car People|date=2017-01-18|work=Road & Track|access-date=2017-04-01|language=en}}</ref>}}\n\n=== ''Ford v Ferrari'' ===\n{{Main|Ford v Ferrari}}\n''Ford v Ferrari'' (known as  ''Le Mans '66'' in the UK and other territories) is a sports drama film based on the rivalry between Ford and Ferrari for the dominance at Le Mans distributed by [[20th Century Fox]].

The lashkars were advancing along three axes - North of Wular lake, along the main Muzzafarabad-Baramula-Patan-Srinagar axis and from Gulmarg. Along the Gulmarg route, a lashkar of 700 raiders was known to be approaching Badgam but no contact had been made with it.<ref name=\"Rescue\">{{cite book |title=Operation Rescue:Military Operations in Jammu & Kashmir 1947-49|last=Sinha |first=Lt.

Alternatively, they could bypass the Patan defenses from the south and reach Srinagar unhindered.\n\nAt that moment, only a weak brigade of Indian troops, withdrawn from refugee protection duties in Punjab and hastily airlifted, stood between groups of tribal lashkars advancing towards Srinagar. Indian troops were deployed only at Srinagar airfield, [[Magam]] and [[Pattan]]. A detachment of Mahrajah's Bodyguard (State Forces cavalry) reconnoitred North of Wular Lake.<ref name=\"Slender\"/>{{rp|51\u201369}}\n\n==Patrol plan==\n[[Lionel Protip Sen|Brigadier L.P. Sen]], newly arrived commander of [[161st Indian Infantry Brigade|161 Infantry Brigade]] decided to send a strong fighting patrol to the hills overseeing Badgam village 5&nbsp;km west of it. The task of the patrol was to search the area in the vicinity of Badgam and the area between Badgam and Magam for signs of the infiltrating Pakistanis. The patrol was to comprise two companies of 4th Battalion, [[Kumaon Regiment]] (4 KUMAON) reinforced with a company of 1st Battalion, [[Kumaon Regiment]] (1 KUMAON). The 1 KUMAON company was tasked to patrol ahead of Badgam by bounds, and link up with 1st Battalion, [[Punjab Regiment (India)|Punjab Regiment]] (1 PUNJAB) at Magam after which it would return by road. If no contact was made, the 4 KUMAON companies would fall back one by one, vacating Badgam at 1400 hrs.<ref name=\"Slender\">{{cite book |title=Slender Was the Thread: Kashmir Confrontation 1947-48 |last=Sen |first=Maj Gen L.

The patrol proceeded as planned without incident till the time came for withdrawing from Badgam. Sharma was ordered to fall back one company at a time, one company at 1400 hrs and he along with his company at 1500 hrs. At 1430 hrs, movement of tribals was seen to the West and near Badgam village. Sharma correctly surmised the movement in Badgam village was meant to divert attention while the attack would come in from the west. The lashkar attacked from the West. Sharma's company was soon surrounded by the enemy from three sides and sustained heavy casualties from the ensuing mortar bombardment. Sharma realized the importance of holding onto his position as both the city of Srinagar and the airport would be vulnerable if it were lost. Under heavy fire and outnumbered seven to one,<ref name=\"Rescue\"/>{{rp|27}} he urged his company to fight bravely, often exposing himself to danger as he ran from post to post. Despite the forward two platoons falling, Sharma desperately clung to his position with the depth platoon.\n\nWhile he was busy fighting the enemy, a mortar shell exploded on the ammunition near him. His last message to Brigade HQ received a few moments before he was killed was:<ref name=\"Rescue\"/>{{rp|28}}\n<blockquote>\n\"The enemies is only 50 yards from us. We are hopelessly outnumbered.

It is thought to be the inspiration for [[Tulsidas]]\u2019 [[Ramcharitmanas]] in Awadhi. While the Valmiki Ramayana emphasizes Rama's human nature, the Adhyatam Ramayana tells the story from the perspective of his divinity. It is organized into seven Kandas, parallel to Valmiki's.\n*  '''Vasistha Ramayana''' (more commonly known as '''[[Yoga Vasistha]]''') is traditionally attributed to [[Valmiki]]. It is principally a dialogue between [[Vasistha]] and [[Rama]] in which Vasistha advances many of the principle tenets of [[Advaita Vedanta]]. It includes many anecdotes and illustrative stories, but does not recount Valmiki's story of Rama in detail.\n*  '''Laghu Yoga Vasishtha''', by Abhinanda of Kashmir, is an abbreviated version of the Yoga Vasistha.<ref>Leslie, Julia (2003).

In September 2006, the first issue of ''[[Ramayan 3392 A.D.]]'' was published by [[Virgin Comics]], featuring the Ramayana as re-envisioned by author [[Deepak Chopra]] and filmmaker [[Shekhar Kapur]].\n\nAuthor [[Ashok Banker]], authored an eight-volume imaginative retelling based on the Ramayana which found considerable success and was credited with ushering in a new wave of interest in the epic as well as other mythological retellings. Banker's version took considerable liberties with the original Sanskrit epic yet found critical acclaim. It is claimed to be the most popular retelling of the epic currently.\n\nMore recently, popular Indian lyricist, music director and singer, [[Ravindra Jain]] wrote the Hindi version of Ramayan named, Ravindra Ramayan ({{ISBN|978-9351862604}}) which was published after his death.

US animation artist [[Nina Paley]] retold the ''Ramayana'' from Sita's point of view (with a secondary story about Paley's own marriage) in the animated musical ''[[Sita Sings the Blues]]''.

It is thought to be the inspiration for [[Tulsidas]]\u2019 [[Ramcharitmanas]] in Awadhi. While the Valmiki Ramayana emphasizes Rama's human nature, the Adhyatam Ramayana tells the story from the perspective of his divinity. It is organized into seven Kandas, parallel to Valmiki's.\n*  '''Vasistha Ramayana''' (more commonly known as '''[[Yoga Vasistha]]''') is traditionally attributed to [[Valmiki]]. It is principally a dialogue between [[Vasistha]] and [[Rama]] in which Vasistha advances many of the principle tenets of [[Advaita Vedanta]]. It includes many anecdotes and illustrative stories, but does not recount Valmiki's story of Rama in detail.\n*  '''Laghu Yoga Vasishtha''', by Abhinanda of Kashmir, is an abbreviated version of the Yoga Vasistha.<ref>Leslie, Julia (2003).

Banker's version took considerable liberties with the original Sanskrit epic yet found critical acclaim. It is claimed to be the most popular retelling of the epic currently.\n\nMore recently, popular Indian lyricist, music director and singer, [[Ravindra Jain]] wrote the Hindi version of Ramayan named, Ravindra Ramayan ({{ISBN|978-9351862604}}) which was published after his death.

Coinciding with the general decline of the [[Viking Age]], the influx of [[Norsemen|Scandinavians]] to Rus' stopped, and Varangians were gradually assimilated by East Slavs by the late 11th century.\n\n==Etymology==\n[[Medieval Greek]] \u0392\u03ac\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 ''V\u00e1rangos'' and [[Old East Slavic]] \u0412\u0430\u0440\u044f\u0433\u044a ''Varjag\u016d'' ([[Old Church Slavonic]] \u0412\u0430\u0440\u0467\u0433\u044a ''Var\u0119g\u016d'') are derived from [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]] ''v\u00e6ringi'', originally  a compound of ''[[v\u00e1r]]'' 'pledge' or 'faith', and ''gengi'' 'companion', thus meaning 'sworn companion', 'confederate', extended to mean 'a foreigner who has taken service with a new lord by a treaty of fealty to him', or 'prot\u00e9g\u00e9'.<ref name=\"Harper\"/><ref>H.S.

This suggests that the term ''Rus{{'}}'' was used broadly to denote Scandinavians until it became too firmly associated with the now extensively Slavicised elite of Kievan Rus.

Initially the Rus founded Staraya Ladoga as the first node from the Baltic to the Caspian Sea and Black Sea. By the end of the 9th century Staraya Ladoga was replaced as the most important center by Novgorod. From these centers the Rus were able to send their goods as far as Baghdad. Baghdad was the political and cultural center of the Islamic world in the 9th and 10th centuries and the Rus merchants who went there to trade their goods for silver interacted with cultures and goods from the Islamic World, but also from China, India, and North Africa.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Batey|first1=Colleen E.|last2=Graham-Campbell|first2=James|title=Cultural Atlas of the Viking World|url=https://archive.org/details/culturalatlasofv00bate|url-access=registration|date=1994|publisher=Facts on File|location=New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/culturalatlasofv00bate/page/184 184]}}</ref>\n\nThe trade between the Rus and the lands south of the Black and Caspian seas made it possible for cultural interactions to take place between the Rus and the Islamic World.

The Rus' undertook the first large-scale expedition in 913; having arrived on 500 ships, they pillaged [[Gorgan]], in the territory of present-day [[Iran]], and the adjacent areas, taking slaves and goods. On their return, the northern raiders were attacked and defeated by [[Khazar]] Muslims in the [[Volga Delta]], and those who escaped were killed by the local tribes on the middle [[Volga]].\n\nDuring their next expedition in 943, the Rus' captured [[Barda, Azerbaijan|Barda]], the capital of [[Arran (Azerbaijan)|Arran]], in the modern-day Republic of [[Azerbaijan]]. The Rus' stayed there for several months, killing many inhabitants of the city and amassing substantial plunder. It was only an outbreak of [[dysentery]] among the Rus' that forced them to depart with their spoils. [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev|Sviatoslav]], prince of Kiev, commanded the next attack, which destroyed the Khazar state in 965. Sviatoslav's campaign established Rus' control over the north-south trade routes, helping to alter the demographics of the region. Raids continued through the time period with the last Scandinavian attempt to reestablish the route to the Caspian Sea led by [[Ingvar the Far-Travelled]] in 1041. While there, Varangians took part in the Georgian-Byzantine [[Battle of Sasireti]] in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] (1042).\n\n==Byzantine Empire==\n[[File:The body of Leo V is dragged to the Hippodrome through the Skyla Gate.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Varangian Guardsmen, an illumination from the 11th-century chronicle of [[John Skylitzes]].]]\n\nThe earliest [[Byzantine]] record of the Rus' may have been written prior to 842.

Contemporary Byzantine presence of the Rus' is mentioned in the [[Franks|Frankish]] [[Annals of St. Bertin]]. These relate that a delegation from the court of the [[Byzantine emperor]] visited Frankish [[King of the Franks|Emperor]] [[Louis the Pious]] at his court in [[Ingelheim]] in 839. In this delegation were two men who called themselves '''Rhos''' (''Rhos vocari dicebant''). Louis enquired about their origins and learnt that they were Swedes. Fearing that they were spies for their brothers, the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]], he incarcerated them.\n\nIn 860, the Rus' under [[Askold and Dir]] launched their [[Rus'-Byzantine War (860)|first attack on Constantinople]] from Kiev. The result of this attack is disputed, but the Varangians continued their efforts as they regularly sailed on their [[monoxyla]] down the Dnieper into the [[Black Sea]]. The Rus' [[Caspian expeditions of the Rus|raids into the Caspian Sea]] were recorded by Arab authors in the 870s and in 910, 912, 913, 943, and later. Although the Rus' had predominantly peaceful trading relations with the Byzantines, the rulers of Kiev launched the relatively successful [[Rus'-Byzantine War (907)|naval expedition of 907]] and the [[Rus'\u2013Byzantine War (941)|abortive campaign of 941]] against Constantinople, as well as the large-scale invasion of the [[Balkans]] by [[Sviatoslav I]] in 968\u2013971. \nIn 1043, Yaroslav sent his son Vladimir to attack Constantinople.

The Anglo-Saxons and other Germanic peoples shared with the Vikings a tradition of faithful, oath-bound service (to death if necessary), and after the Norman Conquest of England there were many fighting men, who had lost their lands and former masters, looking for a living elsewhere.\n\nThe Varangian Guard not only provided security for Byzantine emperors but participated in many wars involving Byzantium and often played a crucial role, since it was usually employed at critical moments of battle. By the late 13th century, Varangians were mostly ethnically assimilated by Byzantines, though the guard operated until at least the mid-14th century, and in 1400 there were still some people identifying themselves as \"Varangians\" in Constantinople.\n\n==In popular culture==\n* [[Rosemary Sutcliff]]'s 1976 historical novel [[Blood Feud (novel)|''Blood Feud'']] depicts Basil II's formation of the Varangian Guard from the point of view of a half-Saxon orphan who journeyed to Constantinople via the Dnieper trade route.\n* [[Henry Treece]]'s [[Viking Trilogy]] recounts the adventures of Harald Sigurdson, including service in the Varangian Guard.\n* Michael Ennis's ''Byzantium'' {{ISBN|978-0-330-31596-8}}, a fictionalised version of the life of [[Harald Hardrada]], features time in the Varangian Guard.\n* Also [[Poul Anderson]]'s ''The Last Viking'', another version of [[Harald Hardrada]]'s life, features his time in the Varangian Guard and his tragic love for a Greek woman of Constantinople. \n* Swedish writer [[Frans G. Bengtsson]]'s Viking saga ''[[The Long Ships]]'' (or ''Red Orm'') includes a section in which the main character's brother serves in the Varangians and gets involved in Byzantine court intrigues, with highly unpleasant results. \n* In ''[[The Bulpington of Blup]]'' (1933) by [[H.G. Wells]], the father of the protagonist maintains for years the fiction that he is at work on \"a History of the Varangians that was to outshine [[Charles Montagu Doughty|Doughty]]\".\n* The [[John Ringo]] ''[[Paladin of Shadows]]'' series features a fictional, long-forgotten enclave of the Varangian Guard in the mountains of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].\n* [[Turisas]]' second studio album ''[[The Varangian Way]]'' is a concept album that tells the story of a group of Scandinavians travelling the river routes of medieval Russia, through Ladoga, Novgorod and Kiev to the Byzantine Empire. Their third album, [[Stand Up and Fight (album)|''Stand Up and Fight'']], describes the history of the Varangian Guard's service to the Byzantine Empire.\n* Bearded axe-wielding [[Easterlings]] known as \"Variags\" appear in Tolkien's fantasy novel ''[[The Return of the King]]''.\n* In the PC game series ''[[Mount & Blade]]'', the name and location of the Vaegirs echos the Varangians. Their faction have a unique unit called a \"Vaegir Guard\".\n* In the video games ''[[Medieval: Total War]]'' and ''[[Medieval II: Total War]]'' the Varangian Guard is an axe-wielding elite infantry unit of the Byzantine Empire.\n* Track 5 of [[Amon Amarth]]'s seventh studio album ''[[Twilight of the Thunder God]]'' has the title \"Varyags of Miklagaard\".\n* Track 2 of [[Grand Magus]]'s eight studio album ''Sword Songs'' is titled \"Varangian\".\n* Varangian soldiers are a common enemy in the video game ''[[Assassin's Creed: Revelations]]''.\n* Russian writer [[Dmitry Bykov]]'s novel ''Living Souls'' (''\u0416\u0414'') involved a civil war between Varangians and [[Khazars]] over the control of Russia\n* Varangians in ''[[Dark Souls II]]'' were pirates pressed into service of the King of Drangleic.\n* In the [[Warhammer 40K]] universe, there is a chapter of [[Space Marines (Warhammer 40,000)|space marines]] known as the \"Space Wolves\" that also go by the \"Vaerangian Guard\" {{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n* In the PC game ''[[Crusader Kings II]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ckiiwiki.com/Mercenaries#Mercenaries|title=Mercenaries|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2015}}</ref> the Varangian Guard appear as a mercenary unit available exclusively to the Byzantine emperor.\n* ''The Walking Drum'' by [[Louis L'Amour]]{{clarify|date=February 2017|reason=What about it?}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ancient Germanic culture|Middle Ages}}\n{{commons category}}\n{{div col}}\n* For the Scandinavians who travelled westward, see [[Vikings]]\n* [[Byzantine army]]\n* [[Byzantine bureaucracy and aristocracy]]\n* [[Christianization of Kievan Rus']]\n* [[Komnenian army]]\n* [[Kylfings]]\n* [[Oeselians]]\n* [[Piraeus Lion]] (inscription made by Varangians)\n* [[Rulers of Kievan Rus']]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin|2}}\n'''Primary sources'''\n* [[Russian Primary Chronicle|Russian ''Primary Chronicle'']]\n* ''[[Strategikon of Kekaumenos]]'' by [[Kekaumenos]]\n* ''[[Alexiad]]'' by [[Anna Comnena|Anna Komnena]]\n* ''Deeds of John and Manuel Comnenus'' by [[John Kinnamos]]\n* ''Historia ecclesiastica'' by Ordericus Vitalis\n* ''Chronicon universale anonymi Laudunensis''\n* ''[[J\u00e1tvar\u00f0ar Saga]]''\n* ''[[Heimskringla]]''\n* ''[[Laxd\u0153la saga]]''\n\n'''Additional secondary sources'''\n* Buckler, Georgina.

Eventually most of them, both in Byzantium and in Eastern Europe, were converted from [[paganism]] to [[Orthodox Christianity]], culminating in the [[Christianization of Kievan Rus']] in 988.

The Varangians (''Varyags'', in [[Old East Slavic language|Old East Slavic]]) are first mentioned by the ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'' as having exacted tribute from the Slavic and Finnic tribes in 859. It was the time of rapid expansion of the Vikings in Northern Europe; England began to pay [[Danegeld]] in 859, and the [[Curonians]] of [[Grobin]] faced an invasion by the Swedes at about the same date.\n\nIt has been argued that the word ''Varangian'', in its many forms, does not appear in primary sources until the eleventh century (though it does appear frequently in later sources describing earlier periods). This suggests that the term ''Rus{{'}}'' was used broadly to denote Scandinavians until it became too firmly associated with the now extensively Slavicised elite of Kievan Rus. At that point, the new term ''Varangian'' was increasingly preferred to name Scandinavians, probably mostly from what is currently Sweden,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Forte|first1=Angelo|first2=Richard|last2=Oram|first3=Frederik|last3=Pedersen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_vEd859jvk0C&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&q=&f=false |title=Viking Empires|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year= 2005|ISBN= 0-521-82992-5|pages=13\u201314}}</ref> plying the river-routes between the Baltic and the Black/Caspian Seas.<ref>Marika M\u00e4gi, ''In <i>Austrvegr</i>: The Role of the Eastern Baltic in Viking Age Communication Across the Baltic Sea'', The Northern World, 84 (Leiden: Brill, 2018), p. 195, citing Alf Thulin, 'The Rus' of Nestor's Chronicle', ''Mediaeval Scandinavia'', 13 (2000), 70-96.</ref>\n\nDue largely to geographic considerations, it is often argued that most of the Varangians who traveled and settled in the lands of eastern Baltic, modern Russian Federation and lands to the south came from the area of modern [[Sweden]].\n\nThe Varangians left a number of [[varangian runestones|rune stones]] in their native [[Sweden]] that tell of their journeys to what is today Russia, Ukraine, Greece, and Belarus. Most of these rune stones can be seen today, and are a telling piece of historical evidence. The [[Varangian runestones]] tell of many notable Varangian expeditions, and even account for the fates of individual warriors and travelers.\n\n==Islamic world==\n{{Further|Volga trade route|Caspian expeditions of the Rus'}}\n[[File:Funeral of ruthenian noble by Siemiradzki.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|[[Ship burial]] of a [[Rus (people)|Rus]] chieftain as described by the [[Arab]] traveler [[Ahmad ibn Fadlan]] who visited [[Kievan Rus]] in the 10th century, painted by [[Henryk Siemiradzki]] (1883)]]\n\nThe Rus' initially appeared in Serkland in the 9th century, traveling as merchants along the Volga trade route, selling furs, honey, and slaves, as well as luxury goods such as amber, Frankish swords, and walrus ivory.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Batey|first1=Colleen E.|last2=Graham-Campbell|first2=James |author-link2=James Graham-Campbell|title=Cultural Atlas of the Viking World|url=https://archive.org/details/culturalatlasofv00bate|url-access=registration|date=1994|publisher=Facts on File|location=New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/culturalatlasofv00bate/page/194 194]}}</ref> These goods were mostly exchanged for Arabian silver coins, called dirhams.

Initially the Rus founded Staraya Ladoga as the first node from the Baltic to the Caspian Sea and Black Sea. By the end of the 9th century Staraya Ladoga was replaced as the most important center by Novgorod. From these centers the Rus were able to send their goods as far as Baghdad. Baghdad was the political and cultural center of the Islamic world in the 9th and 10th centuries and the Rus merchants who went there to trade their goods for silver interacted with cultures and goods from the Islamic World, but also from China, India, and North Africa.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Batey|first1=Colleen E.|last2=Graham-Campbell|first2=James|title=Cultural Atlas of the Viking World|url=https://archive.org/details/culturalatlasofv00bate|url-access=registration|date=1994|publisher=Facts on File|location=New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/culturalatlasofv00bate/page/184 184]}}</ref>\n\nThe trade between the Rus and the lands south of the Black and Caspian seas made it possible for cultural interactions to take place between the Rus and the Islamic World. The account written by Ibn Fadlan about his 921\u2013922 travels from Baghdad to the capital of the Bulghar kingdom gives details which can reveal the cultural interaction between the two groups. Ibn Fadlan gives a vivid description of the daily habits of the Rus, as well as the only known first-person account of the complicated ship-burning funeral ceremony. Certain details in his account, especially the dialogue of the ceremonies and his personal conversations with Rus individuals, show that the Rus and the Arabs were interested in and fairly knowledgeable about each other\u2019s cultures.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Montgomery|first1=James E.|title=Ibn Fadlan and the Rusiyyah|journal=Journal of Arabic and Islamic Studies|date=2000|volume=3}}</ref>\n\nThe geography of the Volga region and the relative lack of physical wealth available for stealing (compared to targets of Viking raids in the west) made raiding a less important aspect of the Rus/Varangian activities in the East.

The Rus' undertook the first large-scale expedition in 913; having arrived on 500 ships, they pillaged [[Gorgan]], in the territory of present-day [[Iran]], and the adjacent areas, taking slaves and goods. On their return, the northern raiders were attacked and defeated by [[Khazar]] Muslims in the [[Volga Delta]], and those who escaped were killed by the local tribes on the middle [[Volga]].\n\nDuring their next expedition in 943, the Rus' captured [[Barda, Azerbaijan|Barda]], the capital of [[Arran (Azerbaijan)|Arran]], in the modern-day Republic of [[Azerbaijan]]. The Rus' stayed there for several months, killing many inhabitants of the city and amassing substantial plunder. It was only an outbreak of [[dysentery]] among the Rus' that forced them to depart with their spoils. [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev|Sviatoslav]], prince of Kiev, commanded the next attack, which destroyed the Khazar state in 965. Sviatoslav's campaign established Rus' control over the north-south trade routes, helping to alter the demographics of the region. Raids continued through the time period with the last Scandinavian attempt to reestablish the route to the Caspian Sea led by [[Ingvar the Far-Travelled]] in 1041. While there, Varangians took part in the Georgian-Byzantine [[Battle of Sasireti]] in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] (1042).\n\n==Byzantine Empire==\n[[File:The body of Leo V is dragged to the Hippodrome through the Skyla Gate.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Varangian Guardsmen, an illumination from the 11th century chronicle of [[John Skylitzes]].]]\n\nThe earliest [[Byzantine]] record of the Rus' may have been written prior to 842. It is preserved in the Greek ''Life of St. George of Amastris'', which speaks of a raid that had extended into [[Paphlagonian expedition of the Rus|Paphlagonia]]. Contemporary Byzantine presence of the Rus' is mentioned in the [[Franks|Frankish]] [[Annals of St. Bertin]]. These relate that a delegation from the court of the [[Byzantine emperor]] visited Frankish [[King of the Franks|Emperor]] [[Louis the Pious]] at his court in [[Ingelheim]] in 839. In this delegation were two men who called themselves '''Rhos''' (''Rhos vocari dicebant''). Louis enquired about their origins and learnt that they were Swedes. Fearing that they were spies for their brothers, the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]], he incarcerated them.\n\nIn 860, the Rus' under [[Askold and Dir]] launched their [[Rus'-Byzantine War (860)|first attack on Constantinople]] from Kiev. The result of this attack is disputed, but the Varangians continued their efforts as they regularly sailed on their [[monoxyla]] down the Dnieper into the [[Black Sea]]. The Rus' [[Caspian expeditions of the Rus|raids into the Caspian Sea]] were recorded by Arab authors in the 870s and in 910, 912, 913, 943, and later. Although the Rus' had predominantly peaceful trading relations with the Byzantines, the rulers of Kiev launched the relatively successful [[Rus'-Byzantine War (907)|naval expedition of 907]] and the [[Rus'\u2013Byzantine War (941)|abortive campaign of 941]] against Constantinople, as well as the large-scale invasion of the [[Balkans]] by [[Sviatoslav I]] in 968\u2013971. \nIn 1043, Yaroslav sent his son Vladimir to attack Constantinople. The Byzantines destroyed the attacking vessels and defeated Vladimir<ref>T. D. Kendrick,  A History of the Vikings (Ch. Conversion of Russia), Courier Corporation, 2012</ref>\n\nThese raids were successful in forcing the Byzantines to re-arrange their trading arrangements; militarily, the Varangians were usually defeated by the superior Byzantine forces, especially in the sea due to Byzantine use of [[Greek fire]].\n\n===Varangian Guard===\n{{Main|Varangian Guard}}\n[[File:A Thracesian woman kills a Varangian.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Another illumination of a scene from the ''[[Skylitzes Chronicle]]'', depicting a [[Thracesian Theme|Thracesian]] woman killing a Varangian who tried to rape her, whereupon his comrades praised her and gave her his possessions.<ref>{{citation|editor-last=Wortley|editor-first=John|title=John Skylitzes: A Synopsis of Byzantine History, 811\u20131057|location=Cambridge, United Kingdom|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-521-76705-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vGE8Xq832A0C|page=372}}</ref>]]\n\nThe Varangian Guard  ([[Greek language|Greek]]: \u03a4\u03ac\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u0392\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03b3\u03b3\u03c9\u03bd, ''T\u00e1gma t\u014dn Var\u00e1ng\u014dn'') were a part of [[Byzantine Army]] and personal bodyguards of the [[Byzantine emperors]] from the 10th to the 14th centuries.

According to the late Swedish historian [[Alf Henrikson]] in his book ''Svensk Historia'' (''History of Sweden''), the [[Norsemen|Norse]] Varangian guardsmen were recognized by long hair, a red ruby set in the left ear and ornamented dragons sewn on their chainmail shirts.\n\nIn these years, [[Swedish people|Swedish]] men left to enlist in the Byzantine Varangian Guard in such numbers that a medieval Swedish law, [[V\u00e4stg\u00f6talagen]], from [[V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland]] declared no one could inherit while staying in \"Greece\"\u2014the then Scandinavian term for the [[Byzantine Empire]]\u2014to stop the emigration,<ref>Jansson 1980:22</ref> especially as two other European courts simultaneously also recruited Scandinavians:<ref name=\"Pritsak386\">Pritsak 1981:386</ref> [[Kievan Rus']] c. 980\u20131060 and [[London]] 1018\u20131066 (the [[\u00deingali\u00f0]]).<ref name=\"Pritsak386\"/> \n\nComposed primarily of Scandinavians for the first hundred years, the guard increasingly included [[Anglo-Saxons]] after the successful [[Norman Conquest]] of England. By the time of Emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos|Alexios Komnenos]] in the late 11th century, the Varangian Guard was largely recruited from Anglo-Saxons and \"others who had suffered at the hands of the Vikings and their cousins the Normans\". The Anglo-Saxons and other Germanic peoples shared with the Vikings a tradition of faithful, oath-bound service (to death if necessary), and after the Norman Conquest of England there were many fighting men, who had lost their lands and former masters, looking for a living elsewhere.\n\nThe Varangian Guard not only provided security for Byzantine emperors but participated in many wars involving Byzantium and often played a crucial role, since it was usually employed at critical moments of battle. By the late 13th century, Varangians were mostly ethnically assimilated by Byzantines, though the guard operated until at least the mid-14th century, and in 1400 there were still some people identifying themselves as \"Varangians\" in Constantinople.\n\n==In popular culture==\n* [[Rosemary Sutcliff]]'s 1976 historical novel [[Blood Feud (novel)|''Blood Feud'']] depicts Basil II's formation of the Varangian Guard from the point of view of a half-Saxon orphan who journeyed to Constantinople via the Dnieper trade route.\n* [[Henry Treece]]'s [[Viking Trilogy]] recounts the adventures of Harald Sigurdson, including service in the Varangian Guard.\n* Michael Ennis's ''Byzantium'' {{ISBN|978-0-330-31596-8}}, a fictionalised version of the life of [[Harald Hardrada]], features time in the Varangian Guard.\n* Also [[Poul Anderson]]'s ''The Last Viking'', another version of [[Harald Hardrada]]'s life, features his time in the Varangian Guard and his tragic love for a Greek woman of Constantinople. \n* Swedish writer [[Frans G.

Together they trick men out of money. Ziggy takes a liking to a con artist, Denny Reagan, and steals a soldier's watch that Denny admires. The watch's inscription, showing it is a gift from the boy's mother, gives Denny a guilty conscience, so Ziggy returns it to Mart Neilson, the soldier. He asks her on a date, which leads to marriage. Two days later, Neilson is shipped off to war. He is killed in action while Ziggy is pregnant with their child.\n\nZiggy is warned by Natalie after the birth of baby Martha that she is not fit for motherhood. Denny is now doing time in a penitentiary, so he is no help either. Ziggy likes to go out dancing every night, leaving Martha with an irresponsible young babysitter. While the babysitter sneaks out to be with her boyfriend, Martha tumbles out of her crib and is nearly strangled by the bedsheets. A landlady's testimony results in the baby being sent to a juvenile ward. Ziggy is given a suspended sentence for child neglect, but is forbidden from having contact with her child. Denny's mother tracks down Ziggy and encourages her to pray for salvation.\n\nBy the time Denny leaves prison, he is a reformed man. He tracks down Ziggy and finds that she has taken in an abandoned infant and is caring for it, having named him Denny. Together they appeal to the court for a second chance, then leave together with both children, united as a family.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[James Dunn (actor)|James Dunn]] as Denny Reagan\n* [[Mona Freeman]] as Ziggy Brennan\n* William Marshall as CPO Martin J.

Together they trick men out of money. Ziggy takes a liking to a con artist, Denny Reagan, and steals a soldier's watch that Denny admires. The watch's inscription, showing it is a gift from the boy's mother, gives Denny a guilty conscience, so Ziggy returns it to Mart Neilson, the soldier. He asks her on a date, which leads to marriage. Two days later, Neilson is shipped off to war. He is killed in action while Ziggy is pregnant with their child.\n\nZiggy is warned by Natalie after the birth of baby Martha that she is not fit for motherhood. Denny is now doing time in a penitentiary, so he is no help either. Ziggy likes to go out dancing every night, leaving Martha with an irresponsible young babysitter. While the babysitter sneaks out to be with her boyfriend, Martha tumbles out of her crib and is nearly strangled by the bedsheets. A landlady's testimony results in the baby being sent to a juvenile ward. Ziggy is given a suspended sentence for child neglect, but is forbidden from having contact with her child. Denny's mother tracks down Ziggy and encourages her to pray for salvation.\n\nBy the time Denny leaves prison, he is a reformed man. He tracks down Ziggy and finds that she has taken in an abandoned infant and is caring for it, having named him Denny. Together they appeal to the court for a second chance, then leave together with both children, united as a family.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[James Dunn (actor)|James Dunn]] as Denny Reagan\n* [[Mona Freeman]] as Ziggy Brennan\n* William Marshall as CPO Martin J.
