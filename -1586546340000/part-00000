It seems likely according to M. De M\u00e9ly, that already at the time when the circlet was brought to Paris the sixty or seventy thorns, which seem to have been afterwards distributed by St. Louis and his successors, had been separated from the band of rushes and were kept in a different [[reliquary]]. None of these now remain at Paris. Some small fragments of rush are also preserved ... at Arras and at Lyons. With regard to the origin and character of the thorns, both tradition and existing remains suggest that they must have come from the bush botanically known as ''Ziziphus spina-christi'', more popularly, the [[Christ's thorn jujube|jujube tree]]. This reaches the height of fifteen or twenty feet and is found growing in abundance by the wayside around Jerusalem. The crooked branches of this shrub are armed with thorns growing in pairs, a straight spine and a curved one commonly occurring together at each point. The relic preserved in the Capella della Spina at [[Pisa]], as well as that at [[Trier]], which though their early history is doubtful and obscure, are among the largest in size, afford a good illustration of this peculiarity.<ref name=thurston1908/></blockquote>\n\n==Third-class relics==\n[[File:Nuremberg Silver Medal Jesus by Valentin Maler ND, obverse.jpg|thumb|[[Nuremberg]] 16th-century silver medal of Jesus Christ with a crown of thorns by Valentin Maler.]]\n\nNot all of the reputed holy thorns are first-class relics, that is, relics of the original crown. M. de M\u00e9ly was able to enumerate more than 700. The statement in one medieval obituary that [[Peter de Averio]] gave to the [[cathedral of Angers]], \"''unam de spinis quae fuit apposita coronae spinae nostri Redemptoris''{{-\"}} (\"one of the spines which were attached to the thorny crown of our Redeemer\") (de M\u00e9ly, p.&nbsp;362) indicates that many of the thorns were [[relic]]s of the third class\u2014objects touched to a relic of the first class, in this case some part of the crown itself. (In Roman Catholic tradition, a relic of the first class is a part of the body of a saint or, in this case, any of the objects used in the Crucifixion that carried the blood of Christ; a relic of the second class is anything known to have been touched or used by a saint; a relic of the third class is a devotional object touched to a first-class relic and, usually, formally blessed as a sacramental.) Again, even in comparatively modern times, it is not always easy to trace the history of these objects of devotion, as first-class relics were often divided and any number of authentic third-class relics may exist.\n\n==Purported remnants==\n[[File:Solario, Andrea-Christ portant sa croix-1513-Nantes.jpg|thumb|''Christ Carrying the Cross'' by [[Andrea Solario]], 1513, portrays the crown of thorns]]\n[[File:Michelangelo Merisi, called Caravaggio - The Crowning with Thorns - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Caravaggio - ''[[The Crowning with Thorns (Caravaggio)|The Crowning with Thorns]]'', 1603]]\n\nThe [[Holy Thorn Reliquary]] in the [[British Museum]], containing a single thorn, was made in the 1390s for the French prince [[Jean, duc de Berry]], who is documented as receiving several thorns from Charles V and VI, his brother and nephew.<ref>Cherry, 22\u201323</ref>\n\nThe ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' (1908) reported two \"holy thorns\" were venerated, the one at St. Michael's church in Ghent, the other at [[Stonyhurst College]], both professing to be the thorn given by Mary Queen of Scots to Thomas Percy, Earl of Northumberland.<ref name=thurston1908>{{cite book |last1=Thurston |first1=Herbert |authorlink1=Herbert Thurston |title=The Catholic Encyclopedia |date=1908 |publisher=Appleton |location=New York |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04540b.htm |chapter=Crown of Thorns}}</ref>\n\nThe [https://web.archive.org/web/20010408045046/http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Olympus/9587/gazeteer.html  \"Gazetteer of Relics and Miraculous Images\"] lists the following, following Cruz 1984:\n*Belgium: Parochial Church of [[Wevelgem]]: a portion of the crown of thorns (since 1561)<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nieuwsblad.be/article/detail.aspx?articleid=GJKPOO8O|title=In de ban van de Heilige Doorn (Wevelgem)|last=Vandaele|first=Luc|date=20 March 2006|work=[[Het Nieuwsblad]]|language=Dutch|accessdate=4 February 2014}}</ref>\n*Belgium: [[Ghent]], St. Michael's Church: A thorn from the crown of thorns\n*Czech Republic: [[Prague]], [[St. Vitus Cathedral]]: A thorn of the crown of thorns, in the cross at the top of [[Crown of Saint Wenceslas]], part of the [[Bohemian Crown Jewels]]\n*France: [[Notre-Dame de Paris]]: The circlet of rushes of the crown of thorns, displayed the first Friday of each month and all Fridays in Lent (including Good Friday)\n*France: [[Sainte-Chapelle]]: A portion of the crown of thorns, brought to the site by Louis IX.\n*Germany: [[Cathedral of Trier]]: A thorn from the crown of thorns\n*Germany: [[Cologne]], [[Kolumba]]: A thorn from the crown of thorns, given by Louis IX to the Dominicans of [[Li\u00e8ge]], and a second thorn from the treasure of [[St. Kolumba, Cologne]]\n*Germany: [[Elchingen]]: Church of the former Benedictine Abbey [[Kloster Elchingen]]: a thorn brought to the church in 1650/51<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/neu-ulm/Der-Dorn-und-die-Bruderschaft-id16436761.html|title=Glaube: Der Dorn und die Bruderschaft|last=Deger|first=Manfred|date=24 August 2011|work=[[Augsburger Allgemeine]]|language=German|accessdate=4 February 2014}}</ref>\n*Italy: [[Rome]], [[Santa Croce in Gerusalemme]]: Two thorns from the crown of thorns.\n*Italy: [[Rome]], [[Santa Prassede]]: A small portion of the crown of thorns\n*Italy: [[Pisa]], [[Chiesa di Santa Chiara]]: A branch with thorns from the crown of thorns\n*Italy: [[Naples]], [[Santa Maria Incoronata, Naples|Santa Maria Incoronata]]: A fragment of the crown of thorns\n*Italy: [[Ariano Irpino]], Cathedral: Two Thorns from the crown of thorns\n*Spain: [[Oviedo]], Cathedral: Five thorns (formerly eight) from the crown of thorns\n*Spain: [[Barcelona]], Cathedral: A thorn from the crown of thorns\n*Spain: [[Seville]], Iglesia de la Anunciaci\u00f3n (Hermandad del Valle): A thorn from the crown of thorns\n*United Kingdom: British Museum: Holy Thorn Reliquary (see above), Salting Reliquary, each with a thorn\n*United Kingdom: [[Stanbrook Abbey]], [[Worcester]]: A thorn from the crown of thorns\n*United Kingdom: [[Stonyhurst College]], [[Lancashire]]: A thorn from the crown of thorns\n*United States: [[Saint Anthony's Chapel (Pittsburgh)|St. Anthony's Chapel]], Pittsburgh: A thorn from the crown of thorns \n*Ukraine: [[Odessa]], St. Prophet Elijah Monastery: A fragment of a thorn of the crown of thorns\n\n==Iconography==\nThe appearance of the crown of thorns in art, notably upon the head of Christ in representations of the Crucifixion or the subject ''[[Ecce Homo]]'', arises after the time of St. Louis and the building of the Sainte-Chapelle. The ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' reported that some archaeologists had professed to discover a figure of the crown of thorns in the circle which sometimes surrounds the [[chi-rho]] emblem on early Christian [[sarcophagus|sarcophagi]], but the compilers considered that it seemed to be quite as probable that this was only meant for a [[laurel wreath]].\n\nThe image of the crown of thorns is often used symbolically to contrast with earthly monarchical crowns. In the symbolism of [[Society of King Charles the Martyr|King Charles the Martyr]], the executed English King Charles I is depicted putting aside his earthly crown to take up the crown of thorns, as in [[William Marshall (illustrator)|William Marshall]]'s print [[Eikon Basilike]]. This contrast appears elsewhere in art, for example in Frank Dicksee's painting ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20081205072146/http://www.artmagick.com/archive/artists/dicksee/pic/10049.aspx The Two Crowns]''.\n\n[[Carnation]]s symbolize the [[Passion (Christianity)|passion]] as they represent the crown of thorns.\n\n==Photo gallery==\n<gallery>\nLate 19th Century Reliquary.JPG|Reliquary made in 1806, commissioned by [[Napoleon]], preserved at [[Notre-Dame de Paris|Notre-Dame Cathedral]].\nHolyCrown.JPG|A second reliquary from 1862, designed by [[Viollet-le-Duc]] preserved at [[Notre-Dame de Paris|Notre-Dame Cathedral]].\nDetail of Crown Reliquary.jpg|Detail of the 1862 reliquary.\nSteChapelle von N.JPG|The [[Sainte-Chapelle]], built to house the Passion Relics.\nSanta Monica Parish Churcjf3437 08.JPG|[[Mater Dolorosa]] and bust of crown of thorns ([[Santa Monica Parish Church (Minalin)|Santa Monica Parish Church]], [[Philippines]])\nEikon.png|[[William Marshall (illustrator)|William Marshall's]] print depicting [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] taking up the crown of thorns\n</gallery>\n==Criticism of the adoration of the crown of thorns==\nA critique of the adoration of the crown of thorns was set forth in 1543 by [[Jean Calvin]] in the work ''[[Treatise on Relics]]''.

Otherwise I know not how it could have attained to such a size. First, a third part of it is at Paris, in the Holy Chapel, and then at Rome there are three thorns in Santa Croce, and some portion also in St. Eustathius. At Sienna, I know not how many thorns, at Vineennes one, at Bourges five, at Besan~on, in the church of St. John, three, and as many at Koningsberg. At the church of St. Salvator, in Spain, are several, but how many I know not; at Compostella, in the church of St. Jago, two; in Vivarais, three; also at Toulouse, Mascon, Charrox in Poicton, St. Clair, Sanflor, San Maximinin Provence, in the monastery of Selles, and also in the church of St. Martin at Noyon, each place having a single thorn. But if diligent search were made, the number might be increased fourfold. It is most evident that there must here be falsehood and imposition. How will the truth be ascertained? It ought, moreover, to be observed, that in the ancient Church it was never known what had become of that crown. Hence it is easy to conclude, that the first twig of that now shown grew many years after our Saviour's death.<ref>[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/An_Admonition_showing,_the_Advantages_which_Christendom_might_derive_from_an_Inventory_of_Relics An Admonition showing, the Advantages which Christendom might derive from an Inventory of Relics  (1844) by John Calvin, translated by Henry Beveridge]</ref></blockquote>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Relics associated with Jesus]]\n**'' [[Arma Christi]]''\n** [[Holy Sponge]]\n** [[Lance of Longinus]]\n** [[Titulus Crucis]]\n** [[True Cross]]\n* [[Crown (headgear)|Crown]]\n* [[Euphorbia milii]]\n* [[Jesus, King of the Jews]]\n* [[Life of Jesus in the New Testament]]\n* [[Man of Sorrows]]\n* [[Paliurus spina-christi]]\n* [[Radiant crown]]\n* [[Solar symbol]]\n* [[Sorrowful Mysteries]]\n* [[Ziziphus spina-christi]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Cherry, John (2010).

It seems likely according to M. De M\u00e9ly, that already at the time when the circlet was brought to Paris the sixty or seventy thorns, which seem to have been afterwards distributed by St. Louis and his successors, had been separated from the band of rushes and were kept in a different [[reliquary]]. None of these now remain at Paris. Some small fragments of rush are also preserved ... at Arras and at Lyons. With regard to the origin and character of the thorns, both tradition and existing remains suggest that they must have come from the bush botanically known as ''Ziziphus spina-christi'', more popularly, the [[Christ's thorn jujube|jujube tree]]. This reaches the height of fifteen or twenty feet and is found growing in abundance by the wayside around Jerusalem. The crooked branches of this shrub are armed with thorns growing in pairs, a straight spine and a curved one commonly occurring together at each point. The relic preserved in the Capella della Spina at [[Pisa]], as well as that at [[Trier]], which though their early history is doubtful and obscure, are among the largest in size, afford a good illustration of this peculiarity.<ref name=thurston1908/></blockquote>\n\n==Third-class relics==\n[[File:Nuremberg Silver Medal Jesus by Valentin Maler ND, obverse.jpg|thumb|[[Nuremberg]] 16th-century silver medal of Jesus Christ with a crown of thorns by Valentin Maler.]]\n\nNot all of the reputed holy thorns are first-class relics, that is, relics of the original crown. M. de M\u00e9ly was able to enumerate more than 700. The statement in one medieval obituary that [[Peter de Averio]] gave to the [[cathedral of Angers]], \"''unam de spinis quae fuit apposita coronae spinae nostri Redemptoris''{{-\"}} (\"one of the spines which were attached to the thorny crown of our Redeemer\") (de M\u00e9ly, p.&nbsp;362) indicates that many of the thorns were [[relic]]s of the third class\u2014objects touched to a relic of the first class, in this case some part of the crown itself. (In Roman Catholic tradition, a relic of the first class is a part of the body of a saint or, in this case, any of the objects used in the Crucifixion that carried the blood of Christ; a relic of the second class is anything known to have been touched or used by a saint; a relic of the third class is a devotional object touched to a first-class relic and, usually, formally blessed as a sacramental.) Again, even in comparatively modern times, it is not always easy to trace the history of these objects of devotion, as first-class relics were often divided and any number of authentic third-class relics may exist.\n\n==Purported remnants==\n[[File:Solario, Andrea-Christ portant sa croix-1513-Nantes.jpg|thumb|''Christ Carrying the Cross'' by [[Andrea Solario]], 1513, portrays the crown of thorns]]\n[[File:Michelangelo Merisi, called Caravaggio - The Crowning with Thorns - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Caravaggio - ''[[The Crowning with Thorns (Caravaggio)|The Crowning with Thorns]]'', 1603]]\n\nThe [[Holy Thorn Reliquary]] in the [[British Museum]], containing a single thorn, was made in the 1390s for the French prince [[Jean, duc de Berry]], who is documented as receiving several thorns from Charles V and VI, his brother and nephew.<ref>Cherry, 22\u201323</ref>\n\nThe ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' (1908) reported two \"holy thorns\" were venerated, the one at St. Michael's church in Ghent, the other at [[Stonyhurst College]], both professing to be the thorn given by Mary Queen of Scots to Thomas Percy, Earl of Northumberland.<ref name=thurston1908>{{cite book |last1=Thurston |first1=Herbert |authorlink1=Herbert Thurston |title=The Catholic Encyclopedia |date=1908 |publisher=Appleton |location=New York |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04540b.htm |chapter=Crown of Thorns}}</ref>\n\nThe [https://web.archive.org/web/20010408045046/http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Olympus/9587/gazeteer.html  \"Gazetteer of Relics and Miraculous Images\"] lists the following, following Cruz 1984:\n*Belgium: Parochial Church of [[Wevelgem]]: a portion of the crown of thorns (since 1561)<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nieuwsblad.be/article/detail.aspx?articleid=GJKPOO8O|title=In de ban van de Heilige Doorn (Wevelgem)|last=Vandaele|first=Luc|date=20 March 2006|work=[[Het Nieuwsblad]]|language=Dutch|accessdate=4 February 2014}}</ref>\n*Belgium: [[Ghent]], St. Michael's Church: A thorn from the crown of thorns\n*Czech Republic: [[Prague]], [[St. Vitus Cathedral]]: A thorn of the crown of thorns, in the cross at the top of [[Crown of Saint Wenceslas]], part of the [[Bohemian Crown Jewels]]\n*France: [[Notre-Dame de Paris]]: The circlet of rushes of the crown of thorns, displayed the first Friday of each month and all Fridays in Lent (including Good Friday)\n*France: [[Sainte-Chapelle]]: A portion of the crown of thorns, brought to the site by Louis IX.\n*Germany: [[Cathedral of Trier]]: A thorn from the crown of thorns\n*Germany: [[Cologne]], [[Kolumba]]: A thorn from the crown of thorns, given by Louis IX to the Dominicans of [[Li\u00e8ge]], and a second thorn from the treasure of [[St. Kolumba, Cologne]]\n*Germany: [[Elchingen]]: Church of the former Benedictine Abbey [[Kloster Elchingen]]: a thorn brought to the church in 1650/51<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/neu-ulm/Der-Dorn-und-die-Bruderschaft-id16436761.html|title=Glaube: Der Dorn und die Bruderschaft|last=Deger|first=Manfred|date=24 August 2011|work=[[Augsburger Allgemeine]]|language=German|accessdate=4 February 2014}}</ref>\n*Italy: [[Rome]], [[Santa Croce in Gerusalemme]]: Two thorns from the crown of thorns.\n*Italy: [[Rome]], [[Santa Prassede]]: A small portion of the crown of thorns\n*Italy: [[Pisa]], [[Chiesa di Santa Chiara]]: A branch with thorns from the crown of thorns\n*Italy: [[Naples]], [[Santa Maria Incoronata, Naples|Santa Maria Incoronata]]: A fragment of the crown of thorns\n*Italy: [[Ariano Irpino]], Cathedral: Two Thorns from the crown of thorns\n*Spain: [[Oviedo]], Cathedral: Five thorns (formerly eight) from the crown of thorns\n*Spain: [[Barcelona]], Cathedral: A thorn from the crown of thorns\n*Spain: [[Seville]], Iglesia de la Anunciaci\u00f3n (Hermandad del Valle): A thorn from the crown of thorns\n*United Kingdom: British Museum: Holy Thorn Reliquary (see above), Salting Reliquary, each with a thorn\n*United Kingdom: [[Stanbrook Abbey]], [[Worcester]]: A thorn from the crown of thorns\n*United Kingdom: [[Stonyhurst College]], [[Lancashire]]: A thorn from the crown of thorns\n*United States of America: [[Saint Anthony's Chapel (Pittsburgh)|St. Anthony's Chapel]], Pittsburgh: A thorn from the crown of thorns \n*Ukraine: [[Odessa]], St. Prophet Elijah Monastery: A fragment of a thorn of the crown of thorns\n\n==Iconography==\nThe appearance of the crown of thorns in art, notably upon the head of Christ in representations of the Crucifixion or the subject ''[[Ecce Homo]]'', arises after the time of St. Louis and the building of the Sainte-Chapelle. The ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' reported that some archaeologists had professed to discover a figure of the crown of thorns in the circle which sometimes surrounds the [[chi-rho]] emblem on early Christian [[sarcophagus|sarcophagi]], but the compilers considered that it seemed to be quite as probable that this was only meant for a [[laurel wreath]].\n\nThe image of the crown of thorns is often used symbolically to contrast with earthly monarchical crowns. In the symbolism of [[Society of King Charles the Martyr|King Charles the Martyr]], the executed English King Charles I is depicted putting aside his earthly crown to take up the crown of thorns, as in [[William Marshall (illustrator)|William Marshall]]'s print [[Eikon Basilike]]. This contrast appears elsewhere in art, for example in Frank Dicksee's painting ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20081205072146/http://www.artmagick.com/archive/artists/dicksee/pic/10049.aspx The Two Crowns]''.\n\n[[Carnation]]s symbolize the [[Passion (Christianity)|passion]] as they represent the crown of thorns.\n\n==Photo gallery==\n<gallery>\nLate 19th Century Reliquary.JPG|Reliquary made in 1806, commissioned by [[Napoleon]], preserved at [[Notre-Dame de Paris|Notre-Dame Cathedral]].\nHolyCrown.JPG|A second reliquary from 1862, designed by [[Viollet-le-Duc]] preserved at [[Notre-Dame de Paris|Notre-Dame Cathedral]].\nDetail of Crown Reliquary.jpg|Detail of the 1862 reliquary.\nSteChapelle von N.JPG|The [[Sainte-Chapelle]], built to house the Passion Relics.\nSanta Monica Parish Churcjf3437 08.JPG|[[Mater Dolorosa]] and bust of crown of thorns ([[Santa Monica Parish Church (Minalin)|Santa Monica Parish Church]], [[Philippines]])\nEikon.png|[[William Marshall (illustrator)|William Marshall's]] print depicting [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] taking up the crown of thorns\n</gallery>\n==Criticism of the adoration of the crown of thorns==\nA critique of the adoration of the crown of thorns was set forth in 1543 by [[Jean Calvin]] in the work ''[[Treatise on Relics]]''. He described numerous parts of the crown of thorns known to him, located in different cities.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mullett |first1=Michael |title=John Calvin |date=19 May 2011 |publisher=Routledge |location=Abingdon, England |isbn=9780415476980 |page=105}}</ref> Based on a large number of parts of the crown of thorns, Calvin wrote:\n\n<blockquote>In regard to the Crown of thorns, it would seem that its twigs had been planted that they might grow again. Otherwise I know not how it could have attained to such a size. First, a third part of it is at Paris, in the Holy Chapel, and then at Rome there are three thorns in Santa Croce, and some portion also in St. Eustathius. At Sienna, I know not how many thorns, at Vineennes one, at Bourges five, at Besan~on, in the church of St. John, three, and as many at Koningsberg. At the church of St. Salvator, in Spain, are several, but how many I know not; at Compostella, in the church of St. Jago, two; in Vivarais, three; also at Toulouse, Mascon, Charrox in Poicton, St. Clair, Sanflor, San Maximinin Provence, in the monastery of Selles, and also in the church of St. Martin at Noyon, each place having a single thorn. But if diligent search were made, the number might be increased fourfold. It is most evident that there must here be falsehood and imposition. How will the truth be ascertained? It ought, moreover, to be observed, that in the ancient Church it was never known what had become of that crown. Hence it is easy to conclude, that the first twig of that now shown grew many years after our Saviour's death.<ref>[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/An_Admonition_showing,_the_Advantages_which_Christendom_might_derive_from_an_Inventory_of_Relics An Admonition showing, the Advantages which Christendom might derive from an Inventory of Relics  (1844) by John Calvin, translated by Henry Beveridge]</ref></blockquote>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Relics associated with Jesus]]\n**'' [[Arma Christi]]''\n** [[Holy Sponge]]\n** [[Lance of Longinus]]\n** [[Titulus Crucis]]\n** [[True Cross]]\n* [[Crown (headgear)|Crown]]\n* [[Euphorbia milii]]\n* [[Jesus, King of the Jews]]\n* [[Life of Jesus in the New Testament]]\n* [[Man of Sorrows]]\n* [[Paliurus spina-christi]]\n* [[Radiant crown]]\n* [[Solar symbol]]\n* [[Sorrowful Mysteries]]\n* [[Ziziphus spina-christi]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Cherry, John (2010).

He and [[Jordan Peele]] were cast against each other, but both ended up being picked after demonstrating great comedic chemistry. Key played many characters on the show. One of his most famous characters is \"Coach Hines\", a high school sports coach who frequently disrupts and threatens students and faculty members. On the penultimate episode of ''Mad TV'', Hines revealed that he is the long-lost heir to the Heinz Ketchup company and only became a Catholic school coach to help delinquent teenagers like Yamanashi ([[Bobby Lee]]). During seasons 9 and 10, Key appeared as \"Dr. Funkenstein\" in blaxploitation parodies, with Peele playing the monster. Key also portrayed various guests on ''Real **********ing Talk'' like the strong African Rollo Johnson and blind victim Stevie Wonder Washington. He often goes \"backstage\" as Eugene Struthers, an ecstatic water-or-flower delivery man who accosts celebrities.

There is also \"Jovan Muskatelle\", a shirtless man with a jheri curl and a shower cap.
