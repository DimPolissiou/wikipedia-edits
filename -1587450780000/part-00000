Commonly known as ''Gr\u00e1inne Mhaol'' (anglicised as '''Granuaile''') in [[Irish folklore]], she is a well-known historical figure in 16th-century [[Early Modern Ireland 1536-1691|Irish history]]. Her name was rendered in contemporary English documents in various ways, including Gr\u00e1inne O'Maly, Graney O'Mally, Granny ni Maille, Grany O'Mally, Grayn Ny Mayle, Grane ne Male, Grainy O'Maly, and Granee O'Maillie.

Above all else, she emerges as a woman who broke the mould and thereby played a unique role in history.\"''<ref> Granuaile: Grace O'Malley: Grace O'Malley - Ireland's Pirate Queen, by Anne Chambers; Foreword; Gill & Macmillan Ltd, 2006; {{ISBN|0717151743}}, 9780717151745</ref>\n\nUpon her father's death she took over active leadership of the lordship by land and sea, despite having a brother, D\u00f3nal an Ph\u00edopa \u00d3 Mh\u00e1ille. Marriage to D\u00f3nal an Chogaidh (D\u00f3nal \"the warlike\") \u00d3 Flaithbheartaigh brought her greater wealth and influence, reportedly owning as much as 1,000 head of cattle and horses. In 1593, when her sons Tiob\u00f3id a B\u00farc (Tibbot Bourke) and Murchadh \u00d3 Flaithbheartaigh (Murrough O'Flaherty), and her half-brother D\u00f3nal an Ph\u00edopa (\"D\u00f3nal of the Pipes\"), were taken captive by the English governor of [[Connacht]], [[Richard Bingham (soldier)|Sir Richard Bingham]], O'Malley sailed to England to petition for their release. She formally presented her request to Queen [[Elizabeth I]] at her court in [[Greenwich Palace]].\n\n==Early life==\nN\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille was born in Ireland around 1530, when [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] was [[King of England]] and held the title [[Lord of Ireland]]. Under the policies of the [[English government]] at the time, the semi-autonomous Irish princes and lords were left mostly to their own devices. However, this was to change over the course of O'Malley's life as the [[Tudor conquest of Ireland]] gathered pace.\n\nEoghan Dubhdara \u00d3 M\u00e1ille, her father,<ref name=\"Chambers 2003 20\">{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p=20}}</ref> and his family were based in [[Clew Bay]], [[County Mayo]]. He was lord of the [[O'Malley (surname)|\u00d3 M\u00e1ille dynasty]] and ruler of Umall, descended from [[Maille mac Conall]]. The U\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille (O'Malleys) were one of the seafaring families of Connacht, and they built a row of castles facing the sea to protect their territory. They controlled most of what is now the barony of [[Murrisk]]<ref name=\"Chambers 2003 20\"/> in south-west County Mayo and recognised as their nominal overlords the [[Mac William \u00cdochtar|Mac Uilliam \u00cdochtair]] branch of the Bourkes, who controlled much of what is now County Mayo. The Bourkes (De Burca) were originally [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] but by N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille's lifetime completely [[Gaelicisation|Gaelicised]]. Her mother, Margaret or Maeve, was also a N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille. Although she was the only child of Dubhdara and his wife, O'Malley had a half-brother called D\u00f3nal na P\u00edopa, the son of her father.<ref>{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p=21}}</ref> Although typically during this period sons would inherit, O'Malley \"was considered to be the legal retainer of the family land and seafaring activities\".<ref>[http://publications.ut-capitole.fr/22130/1/Granuaile.pdf O'Connell ]</ref>\n\nWith shore castles like [[Carrickkildavnet Castle|Carrickkildavnet]], the U\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille taxed all those who fished off their coasts, which included fishermen from as far away as England. The head of the family (see [[Chiefs of the Name]]) was known simply by his surname as \u00d3 M\u00e1ille (anglicised as The O'Malley). Local folklore had it that N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille, as a young girl, wished to go on a trading expedition to Spain with her father. Upon being told she could not because her long hair would catch in the ship's ropes, she cut off most of her hair to embarrass her father into taking her. This earned her the nickname \"Gr\u00e1inne Mhaol\" ({{IPA-ga|\u02c8\u0261\u02e0\u027e\u02e0\u0251\u02d0n\u02b2\u0259 w\u0268\u02d0l\u02e0}}; from ''maol'' meaning bald or having cropped hair), usually anglicised as Granuaile ({{IPAc-en|\u02cc|\u0261|r|\u0254\u02d0|nj|\u0259|\u02c8|w|e\u026a|l}}).<ref>as used to name the ships ILV ''Granuaile'' of the [[Commissioners of Irish Lights]]</ref> The nickname may also come from \"Gr\u00e1inne Umhaill\" (\"Gr\u00e1inne of Umhall\", Umhall being a historical district of west [[Connacht]] dominated by the U\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille).<ref>{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p= 57}}</ref>\n\nAs a child she most likely lived at her family's residence of Belclare and [[Clare Island]],<ref name=\"chambers39\"/> but she may have been fostered to another family, for [[fosterage]] was traditional among [[Irish people|Irish]] nobility at the time. She was probably formally educated, since she is believed to have spoken in [[Latin]] with Queen [[Elizabeth I]] in 1593.<ref name=\"Chambers, Anne 2003\">{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p=36}}</ref>\n\n==Marriage to O'Flaherty==\n[[File:Clare Island.jpg|thumb|250px|Clare Island, associated with Gr\u00e1inne O'Malley]]\nN\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille was married in 1546 to [[\u00d3 Flaithbertaigh|D\u00f3nal an Chogaidh \u00d3 Flaithbheartaigh]], ''[[t\u00e1naiste]]'' or heir to the \u00d3 Flaithbheartaigh ([[O'Flaherty]]) title, which would have been a good political match for the daughter of the \u00d3 M\u00e1ille chieftain. As \u00d3 Flaithbheartaigh ''t\u00e1naiste'', D\u00f3nal an Chogaidh had expectations of one day ruling [[Iar Connacht]], the area roughly equivalent to modern [[Connemara]].<ref>{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p=42}}</ref>\n\nShe bore three children during her marriage to D\u00f3nal an Chogaidh:\n* Eoghan (Owen):<ref name=\"chambers44\">{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p=44}}</ref> The eldest child, known to be kind and forgiving. [[Richard Bingham (soldier)|Sir Richard Bingham]] tricked him; Owen was murdered as a result, and Bingham and his troops took over his castle.\n* M\u00e9adhbh (Maeve):<ref name=\"chambers44\"/> Said to be much like her mother, she married Ricard Deamhan an Chorr\u00e1in a B\u00farc, 'the Devil's Hook', with whom she had several children. N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille and a B\u00farc were supposedly very close, more than once saving her from death.\n* Murchadh (Murrough):<ref name=\"chambers44\"/> Murrough was said to take after his father, for he enjoyed warfare. He often beat his sister Maeve, and refused to listen to his mother because of her gender. Many sources report that he betrayed his family and joined forces with Sir Richard Bingham after the murder of Owen. When O'Malley heard of this she swore she would never speak to Murrough again for the rest of her life, though she would often insult him. After D\u00f3nal an Chogaidh's death, O'Malley left Iar Connacht and returned to \u00d3 Mh\u00e1ille territory, taking with her many O'Flaherty followers.<ref>{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p=45}}</ref>\n\nIn 1565, D\u00f3nal was killed in an ambush while hunting in the hills surrounding [[Lough Corrib]]; this was, undoubtedly, part of D\u00f3nal's wider struggle with the Joyces for control of [[Castlekirk|Hen's Castle]] on the lough. Gr\u00e1inne returned to her own lands and established her principal residence on Clare Island (now called [[Granuaile's Castle]]). She allegedly took a shipwrecked sailor as her lover. The affair only lasted briefly as he was killed by the MacMahons of Ballyvoy. Seeking vengeance, Gr\u00e1inne attacked the MacMahon castle of Doona in [[Blacksod Bay]] and killed her lover's murderers on Cahir Island. Her attack on Doona Castle earned her the nickname 'Dark Lady of Doona'.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dib.cambridge.org/viewReadPage.do?articleId=a6886&searchClicked=clicked&quickadvsearch=yes |title=Dictionary of Irish Biography - Cambridge University Press |website=dib.cambridge.org |access-date=2017-03-08}}</ref>\n\n==Marriage to Burke==\n[[File:Carrickahowley (Rockfleet) Castle County Mayo.JPG|thumb|right|[[Rockfleet Castle]]]]\nBy 1566, N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille had married a second time, this time to [[Risde\u00e1rd an Iarainn Bourke|Risde\u00e1rd an Iarainn (\"Iron Richard\") Bourke]], his nickname deriving from his ironworks at [[Burrishoole]], the place of his principal castle and residence.<ref>{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p=63}}</ref> [[Tibbot ne Long Bourke, 1st Viscount Mayo|The 1st Viscount Mayo]] was a child of this marriage. \n\nStill not satisfied with her revenge, N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille then sailed for Ballycroy and attacked the garrison at Doona Castle, overpowering the defenders and taking the castle for herself.<ref name=\"chambers55-56\">{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|pp=55\u201356}}</ref> Her attack against the MacMahons was not the first time she interrupted someone at their prayers. Legend tells of another lord who stole property from her and fled to a church for sanctuary. She was determined to wait out the thief, maintaining that he could starve or surrender. The thief dug a tunnel and escaped, however, and the hermit who took care of the church broke his vow of silence to scold her for attempting to harm someone who had sought sanctuary. Her reply is not recorded.<ref>{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p=56}}</ref>\n\nMore than twenty years after her death, an English [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]] recalled her ability as a leader of fighting men, noting the fame she still had among the [[Irish people]].<ref>{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p=53}}</ref><ref>Calendar of State Papers Relating to Ireland (James I) 1623, no. 997. (London 1860\u20131912)</ref>\n\n==Autonomous status==\nIn 1576, Grace engaged in the [[surrender and regrant]] process with the Lord Deputy Sir [[Henry Sidney]] in respect of her lands. Because Rockfleet was over a week's march from Dublin, and as she was so often at sea, control by the Crown was very weak.\n\nIn 1593, in his letter to protesting N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille's claims against him, Sir Richard Bingham claimed that she was ''\"nurse to all rebellions in the province for this forty years\"''.<ref name=\"chambers52\">{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p=52}}</ref><ref>Lambeth Palace Library MS 601, p. 111</ref> Bingham was Lord President of Connacht, tasked with controlling local lords who had, until then, been mostly autonomous.\n\nN\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille had every reason, and used every opportunity, to limit the power of the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] over her part of the country. An expedition from [[Galway]] led by Sheriff [[William \u00d3ge Martyn]] attacked [[Granuaile's Castle|her castle at Clare Island]] in March 1579. However, they were put to flight and barely escaped.\n\n==Meeting with Elizabeth==\n{{More footnotes|date=August 2008}}\n[[File:The meeting of Grace O'Malley and Queen Elizabeth I.jpg|thumb|250px|The meeting of Grace O'Malley and Queen Elizabeth&nbsp;I (a later illustration from ''Anthologia Hibernica'', vol. 11, 1793)]]\nIn the later 16th century, English power steadily increased in Ireland and N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille's power was steadily encroached upon. Finally in 1593, when her family (her two sons Tibbot Burke and Murrough O'Flaherty, and her half-brother D\u00f3nal na P\u00edopa) were taken captive by the English governor of Connacht, Sir Richard Bingham, N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille sailed to England to petition Queen Elizabeth I for their release. Elizabeth I famously sent N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille a list of questions, which were answered and returned to Elizabeth. N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille then met with the Queen at [[Greenwich Palace]], wearing a fine gown, the two of them were surrounded by guards and the members of Elizabeth's royal Court. \n\nN\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille refused to bow before Elizabeth because she didn't recognise her as the \"Queen of Ireland.\" It's also rumoured that she had a dagger concealed about her person, which guards found upon searching her. Elizabeth's courtiers were said to be very upset and worried, but N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille informed the Queen that she carried it for her own safety. Elizabeth accepted this and seemed untroubled.\n\nSome also reported that N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille had sneezed and was given a lace-edged handkerchief from a noblewoman. She apparently blew her nose into it and then threw the cloth into a nearby fireplace, much to the shock of the court. N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille informed everyone that in Ireland, a used handkerchief was considered dirty and was properly destroyed.\n\nTheir discussion was carried out in Latin, as N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille spoke no English and Queen Elizabeth I spoke no Irish.<ref name=\"Chambers, Anne 2003\" /> After much talk, the two women came to an agreement. Included in the stipulations for each party were that: Elizabeth was to remove Bingham from his position in Ireland, and N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille was to stop supporting the Irish lords' rebellions.\n\nThe meeting seemed to have done some good, for Richard Bingham was removed from service. However, several of N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille's other demands (including the return of the cattle and land that Bingham had stolen from her) remained unmet, and within a rather short period of time Queen Elizabeth I sent Bingham back into Ireland. Upon Bingham's return, N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille realised that the meeting with Elizabeth had been useless, and went back to supporting Irish insurgents during the ''[[Nine Years War (Ireland)|Nine Years' War]].''\n\nShe most likely died at [[Rockfleet Castle]] around 1603. The same year as Elizabeth's death, though the year and place of N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille's death are disputed. Her family's usual burial place was in [[Clare Island Abbey]].\n\n==Biographical sources==\nO'Malley's biography has been written by Irish historian and novelist [[Anne Chambers (author)|Anne Chambers]], who has described O'Malley as:\n<blockquote>\"a fearless leader, by land and by sea, a political pragmatist and politician, a ruthless plunderer, a mercenary, a rebel, a shrewd and able negotiator, the protective matriarch of her family and tribe, a genuine inheritor of the Mother Goddess and Warrior Queen attributes of her remote ancestors. Above all else, she emerges as a woman who broke the mould and thereby played a unique role in history.\"<ref> Granuaile: Grace O'Malley: Grace O'Malley - Ireland's Pirate Queen, by Anne Chambers; Foreword; Gill & Macmillan Ltd, 2006; {{ISBN|0717151743}}, 9780717151745</ref></blockquote>\n\nDocumentary evidence for N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille's life comes mostly from English sources, as she is not mentioned in the Irish annals.

Commonly known as ''Gr\u00e1inne Mhaol'' (anglicised as '''Granuaile''') in [[Irish folklore]], she is a well-known historical figure in 16th-century [[Early Modern Ireland 1536-1691|Irish history]]. Her name was rendered in contemporary English documents in various ways, including Gr\u00e1inne O'Maly, Graney O'Mally, Granny ni Maille, Grany O'Mally, Grayn Ny Mayle, Grane ne Male, Grainy O'Maly, and Granee O'Maillie.

Above all else, she emerges as a woman who broke the mould and thereby played a unique role in history.\"''<ref> Granuaile: Grace O'Malley: Grace O'Malley - Ireland's Pirate Queen, by Anne Chambers; Foreword; Gill & Macmillan Ltd, 2006; {{ISBN|0717151743}}, 9780717151745</ref>\n\nUpon her father's death she took over active leadership of the lordship by land and sea, despite having a brother, D\u00f3nal an Ph\u00edopa \u00d3 Mh\u00e1ille. Marriage to D\u00f3nal an Chogaidh (D\u00f3nal \"the warlike\") \u00d3 Flaithbheartaigh brought her greater wealth and influence, reportedly owning as much as 1,000 head of cattle and horses. In 1593, when her sons Tiob\u00f3id a B\u00farc (Tibbot Bourke) and Murchadh \u00d3 Flaithbheartaigh (Murrough O'Flaherty), and her half-brother D\u00f3nal an Ph\u00edopa (\"D\u00f3nal of the Pipes\"), were taken captive by the English governor of [[Connacht]], [[Richard Bingham (soldier)|Sir Richard Bingham]], O'Malley sailed to England to petition for their release. She formally presented her request to Queen [[Elizabeth I]] at her court in [[Greenwich Palace]].\n\n==Early life==\nN\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille was born in Ireland around 1530, when [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] was [[King of England]] and held the title [[Lord of Ireland]]. Under the policies of the [[English government]] at the time, the semi-autonomous Irish princes and lords were left mostly to their own devices. However, this was to change over the course of O'Malley's life as the [[Tudor conquest of Ireland]] gathered pace.\n\nEoghan Dubhdara \u00d3 M\u00e1ille, her father,<ref name=\"Chambers 2003 20\">{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p=20}}</ref> and his family were based in [[Clew Bay]], [[County Mayo]]. He was lord of the [[O'Malley (surname)|\u00d3 M\u00e1ille dynasty]] and ruler of Umall, descended from [[Maille mac Conall]]. The U\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille (O'Malleys) were one of the seafaring families of Connacht, and they built a row of castles facing the sea to protect their territory. They controlled most of what is now the barony of [[Murrisk]]<ref name=\"Chambers 2003 20\"/> in south-west County Mayo and recognised as their nominal overlords the [[Mac William \u00cdochtar|Mac Uilliam \u00cdochtair]] branch of the Bourkes, who controlled much of what is now County Mayo. The Bourkes (De Burca) were originally [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] but by N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille's lifetime completely [[Gaelicisation|Gaelicised]]. Her mother, Margaret or Maeve, was also a N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille. Although she was the only child of Dubhdara and his wife, O'Malley had a half-brother called D\u00f3nal na P\u00edopa, the son of her father.<ref>{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p=21}}</ref> Although typically during this period sons would inherit, O'Malley \"was considered to be the legal retainer of the family land and seafaring activities\".<ref>[http://publications.ut-capitole.fr/22130/1/Granuaile.pdf O'Connell ]</ref>\n\nWith shore castles like [[Carrickkildavnet Castle|Carrickkildavnet]], the U\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille taxed all those who fished off their coasts, which included fishermen from as far away as England. The head of the family (see [[Chiefs of the Name]]) was known simply by his surname as \u00d3 M\u00e1ille (anglicised as The O'Malley). Local folklore had it that N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille, as a young girl, wished to go on a trading expedition to Spain with her father. Upon being told she could not because her long hair would catch in the ship's ropes, she cut off most of her hair to embarrass her father into taking her. This earned her the nickname \"Gr\u00e1inne Mhaol\" ({{IPA-ga|\u02c8\u0261\u02e0\u027e\u02e0\u0251\u02d0n\u02b2\u0259 w\u0268\u02d0l\u02e0}}; from ''maol'' meaning bald or having cropped hair), usually anglicised as Granuaile ({{IPAc-en|\u02cc|\u0261|r|\u0254\u02d0|nj|\u0259|\u02c8|w|e\u026a|l}}).<ref>as used to name the ships ILV ''Granuaile'' of the [[Commissioners of Irish Lights]]</ref> The nickname may also come from \"Gr\u00e1inne Umhaill\" (\"Gr\u00e1inne of Umhall\", Umhall being a historical district of west [[Connacht]] dominated by the U\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille).<ref>{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p= 57}}</ref>\n\nAs a child she most likely lived at her family's residence of Belclare and [[Clare Island]],<ref name=\"chambers39\"/> but she may have been fostered to another family, for [[fosterage]] was traditional among [[Irish people|Irish]] nobility at the time. She was probably formally educated, since she is believed to have spoken in [[Latin]] with Queen [[Elizabeth I]] in 1593.<ref name=\"Chambers, Anne 2003\">{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p=36}}</ref>\n\n==Marriage to O'Flaherty==\n[[File:Clare Island.jpg|thumb|250px|Clare Island, associated with Gr\u00e1inne O'Malley]]\nN\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille was married in 1546 to [[\u00d3 Flaithbertaigh|D\u00f3nal an Chogaidh \u00d3 Flaithbheartaigh]], ''[[t\u00e1naiste]]'' or heir to the \u00d3 Flaithbheartaigh ([[O'Flaherty]]) title, which would have been a good political match for the daughter of the \u00d3 M\u00e1ille chieftain. As \u00d3 Flaithbheartaigh ''t\u00e1naiste'', D\u00f3nal an Chogaidh had expectations of one day ruling [[Iar Connacht]], the area roughly equivalent to modern [[Connemara]].<ref>{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p=42}}</ref>\n\nShe bore three children during her marriage to D\u00f3nal an Chogaidh:\n* Eoghan (Owen):<ref name=\"chambers44\">{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p=44}}</ref> The eldest child, known to be kind and forgiving. [[Richard Bingham (soldier)|Sir Richard Bingham]] tricked him; Owen was murdered as a result, and Bingham and his troops took over his castle.\n* M\u00e9adhbh (Maeve):<ref name=\"chambers44\"/> Said to be much like her mother, she married Ricard Deamhan an Chorr\u00e1in a B\u00farc, 'the Devil's Hook', with whom she had several children. N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille and a B\u00farc were supposedly very close, more than once saving her from death.\n* Murchadh (Murrough):<ref name=\"chambers44\"/> Murrough was said to take after his father, for he enjoyed warfare. He often beat his sister Maeve, and refused to listen to his mother because of her gender. Many sources report that he betrayed his family and joined forces with Sir Richard Bingham after the murder of Owen. When O'Malley heard of this she swore she would never speak to Murrough again for the rest of her life, though she would often insult him. After D\u00f3nal an Chogaidh's death, O'Malley left Iar Connacht and returned to \u00d3 Mh\u00e1ille territory, taking with her many O'Flaherty followers.<ref>{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p=45}}</ref>\n\nIn 1565, D\u00f3nal was killed in an ambush while hunting in the hills surrounding [[Lough Corrib]]; this was, undoubtedly, part of D\u00f3nal's wider struggle with the Joyces for control of [[Castlekirk|Hen's Castle]] on the lough. Gr\u00e1inne returned to her own lands and established her principal residence on Clare Island (now called [[Granuaile's Castle]]). She allegedly took a shipwrecked sailor as her lover. The affair only lasted briefly as he was killed by the MacMahons of Ballyvoy. Seeking vengeance, Gr\u00e1inne attacked the MacMahon castle of Doona in [[Blacksod Bay]] and killed her lover's murderers on Cahir Island. Her attack on Doona Castle earned her the nickname 'Dark Lady of Doona'.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dib.cambridge.org/viewReadPage.do?articleId=a6886&searchClicked=clicked&quickadvsearch=yes |title=Dictionary of Irish Biography - Cambridge University Press |website=dib.cambridge.org |access-date=2017-03-08}}</ref>\n\n==Marriage to Burke==\n[[File:Carrickahowley (Rockfleet) Castle County Mayo.JPG|thumb|right|[[Rockfleet Castle]]]]\nBy 1566, N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille had married a second time, this time to [[Risde\u00e1rd an Iarainn Bourke|Risde\u00e1rd an Iarainn (\"Iron Richard\") Bourke]], his nickname deriving from his ironworks at [[Burrishoole]], the place of his principal castle and residence.<ref>{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p=63}}</ref> [[Tibbot ne Long Bourke, 1st Viscount Mayo|The 1st Viscount Mayo]] was a child of this marriage. \n\nStill not satisfied with her revenge, N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille then sailed for Ballycroy and attacked the garrison at Doona Castle, overpowering the defenders and taking the castle for herself.<ref name=\"chambers55-56\">{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|pp=55\u201356}}</ref> Her attack against the MacMahons was not the first time she interrupted someone at their prayers. Legend tells of another lord who stole property from her and fled to a church for sanctuary. She was determined to wait out the thief, maintaining that he could starve or surrender. The thief dug a tunnel and escaped, however, and the hermit who took care of the church broke his vow of silence to scold her for attempting to harm someone who had sought sanctuary. Her reply is not recorded.<ref>{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p=56}}</ref>\n\nMore than twenty years after her death, an English [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]] recalled her ability as a leader of fighting men, noting the fame she still had among the [[Irish people]].<ref>{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p=53}}</ref><ref>Calendar of State Papers Relating to Ireland (James I) 1623, no. 997. (London 1860\u20131912)</ref>\n\n==Autonomous status==\nIn 1576 Grace engaged in the [[surrender and regrant]] process with the Lord Deputy Sir [[Henry Sidney]] in respect of her lands. Given that Rockfleet was over a week's march from Dublin, and as she was so often at sea, control by the Crown was in practical terms almost non-existent.\n\nIn 1593, in his letter to protesting N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille's claims against him, Sir Richard Bingham claimed that she was ''\"nurse to all rebellions in the province for this forty years\"''.<ref name=\"chambers52\">{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p=52}}</ref><ref>Lambeth Palace Library MS 601, p. 111</ref> Bingham was Lord President of Connacht, with the task of controlling local lords who had, until then, been mostly autonomous.\n\nN\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille had every reason, and used every opportunity, to limit the power of the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] over her part of the country. An expedition from [[Galway]] led by Sheriff [[William \u00d3ge Martyn]] attacked [[Granuaile's Castle|her castle at Clare Island]] in March 1579. However, they were put to flight and barely escaped.\n\n==Meeting with Elizabeth==\n{{More footnotes|date=August 2008}}\n[[File:The meeting of Grace O'Malley and Queen Elizabeth I.jpg|thumb|250px|The meeting of Grace O'Malley and Queen Elizabeth&nbsp;I (a later illustration from ''Anthologia Hibernica'', vol. 11, 1793)]]\nIn the later 16th century, English power steadily increased in Ireland and N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille's power was steadily encroached upon. Finally in 1593, when her family (her two sons Tibbot Burke and Murrough O'Flaherty, and her half-brother D\u00f3nal na P\u00edopa) were taken captive by the English governor of Connacht, Sir Richard Bingham, N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille sailed to England to petition Queen Elizabeth I for their release. Elizabeth I famously sent N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille a list of questions, which were answered and returned to Elizabeth. N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille then met with the Queen at [[Greenwich Palace]], wearing a fine gown, the two of them were surrounded by guards and the members of Elizabeth's royal Court. \n\nN\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille refused to bow before Elizabeth because she didn't recognise her as the \"Queen of Ireland.\" It's also rumoured that she had a dagger concealed about her person, which guards found upon searching her. Elizabeth's courtiers were said to be very upset and worried, but N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille informed the Queen that she carried it for her own safety. Elizabeth accepted this and seemed untroubled.\n\nSome also reported that N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille had sneezed and was given a lace-edged handkerchief from a noblewoman. She apparently blew her nose into it and then threw the cloth into a nearby fireplace, much to the shock of the court. N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille informed everyone that in Ireland, a used handkerchief was considered dirty and was properly destroyed.\n\nTheir discussion was carried out in Latin, as N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille spoke no English and Queen Elizabeth I spoke no Irish.<ref name=\"Chambers, Anne 2003\" /> After much talk, the two women came to an agreement. Included in the stipulations for each party were that: Elizabeth was to remove Bingham from his position in Ireland, and N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille was to stop supporting the Irish lords' rebellions.\n\nThe meeting seemed to have done some good, for Richard Bingham was removed from service. However, several of N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille's other demands (including the return of the cattle and land that Bingham had stolen from her) remained unmet, and within a rather short period of time Queen Elizabeth I sent Bingham back into Ireland. Upon Bingham's return, N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille realised that the meeting with Elizabeth had been useless, and went back to supporting Irish insurgents during the ''[[Nine Years War (Ireland)|Nine Years' War]].''\n\nShe most likely died at [[Rockfleet Castle]] around 1603. The same year as Elizabeth's death, though the year and place of N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille's death are disputed. Her family's usual burial place was in [[Clare Island Abbey]].\n\n==Biographical sources==\nO'Malley's biography has been written by Irish historian and novelist [[Anne Chambers (author)|Anne Chambers]], who has described O'Malley as:\n<blockquote>\"a fearless leader, by land and by sea, a political pragmatist and politician, a ruthless plunderer, a mercenary, a rebel, a shrewd and able negotiator, the protective matriarch of her family and tribe, a genuine inheritor of the Mother Goddess and Warrior Queen attributes of her remote ancestors. Above all else, she emerges as a woman who broke the mould and thereby played a unique role in history.\"<ref> Granuaile: Grace O'Malley: Grace O'Malley - Ireland's Pirate Queen, by Anne Chambers; Foreword; Gill & Macmillan Ltd, 2006; {{ISBN|0717151743}}, 9780717151745</ref></blockquote>\n\nDocumentary evidence for N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille's life comes mostly from English sources, as she is not mentioned in the Irish annals. The O'Malley family \"book\", a collection of eulogistic bardic poetry and other material of the sort kept by aristocratic Gaelic households of the period, has not survived. There are no contemporary images of her. An important source of information is the eighteen \"Articles of Interrogatory\", questions put to her in writing on behalf of Elizabeth I.<ref>See the supplement to Chambers, 2003.</ref> She is also mentioned in the English State Papers and in other documents of the kind, an example being a letter sent by the Lord Deputy, [[Sir Henry Sidney]], to his son [[Phillip Sidney|Phillip]] in 1577: \"There came to mee a most famous femynyne sea captain called Grace Imallye, and offred her service unto me, wheresoever I woulde command her, with three gallyes and two hundred fightinge men&nbsp;...\"<ref>Lambeth Palace Library, ms. no 601, p. 10, cited in Chambers 2003, p. 85</ref>\n\nLocal traditions concerning her were collected by Irish scholar [[John O'Donovan (scholar)|John O'Donovan]] in the 1830s and 1840s on behalf of the [[Ordnance Survey Memoirs of Ireland|Ordnance Survey of Ireland]]. In a letter of 1838 he describes her as being \"most vividly remembered by tradition and people were living in the last generation who conversed with people who knew her personally\".\n\n<blockquote>Charles Cormick of Erris, now 74 years and six weeks old, saw and conversed with Elizabeth O'Donnell of Newtown within the Mullet, who died about 65 years ago who had seen and intimately known a Mr Walsh who remembered Gr\u00e1inne. Walsh died at the age of 107 and his father was the same age as Gr\u00e1inne.<ref>Gaisford St Lawrence Papers, cited in Chambers 2003, p. 73</ref></blockquote>\n\nA story is recorded of N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille chiding her son T\u00edobo\u00edd in the course of an attack on Kinturk Castle, when she thought he was shirking the battle: \"''An ag iarraidh dul i bhfolach ar mo th\u00f3in at\u00e1 t\u00fa, an \u00e1it a dt\u00e1inig t\u00fa as?''\" (\"Are you trying to hide in my arse, the place that you came out of?\").<ref name=\"Ordnance Survey Letters 2003\">Ordnance Survey Letters, Mayo, vol. II, cited in Chambers 2003, spelling modernised.</ref> She is also recorded as saying, with regard to her followers, \"''go mb'fhearr l\u00e9i l\u00e1n loinge de chlann Chonraoi agus de chlann Mhic an Fhail\u00ed n\u00e1 l\u00e1n loinge d'\u00f3r''\" (that she would rather have a shipload of Conroys and MacAnallys than a shipload of gold).<ref name=\"Ordnance Survey Letters 2003\"/>\n\n==Westport House==\n[[Westport House]] in County Mayo, Ireland, was the seat of the Browne dynasty, [[Marquess of Sligo|Marquesses of Sligo]], direct descendants of Gr\u00e1inne N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille. The current house was built close to the site of Cahernamart (''Cathair na Mart'' - \"fort of the slaughtered cows\"), an O'Malley fort. The original house was built by Colonel John Browne, a Jacobite, who was at the [[Siege of Limerick (1650\u201351)]], and his wife Maude Bourke. Maude Bourke was N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille's great-great granddaughter.\n\nThere is a bronze statue of O'Malley by the artist Michael Cooper \u2013 the brother-in-law of [[Jeremy Browne, 11th Marquess of Sligo|the 11th Marquess of Sligo]] \u2013 in the grounds of Westport House.<ref>'Westport House A Brief History' Westport House 2008</ref> Westport House also contains a comprehensive exhibition on the life of O'Malley compiled by author [[Anne Chambers (author)|Anne Chambers]], a leading authority on Granuaile.\n\n==Cultural impact==\nO'Malley's life has inspired many musicians, novelists, and playwrights to create works based on her life and adventures and she has been used as a [[National personification|personification]] of Ireland:<ref>{{cite book |first=James |last=Hardiman |author-link=James Hardiman |title=Irish Minstrelsy; or Bardic Remains of Ireland, Volume 2 |year=1831 |page=[https://archive.org/details/irishminstrelsy00hardgoog/page/n154 140] |url=https://archive.org/details/irishminstrelsy00hardgoog}}\n<blockquote>Her name has been frequently used by our Bards, to designate Ireland.

It was largely built in its present form in the late 13th century by Laurence de Ludlow, on the earlier castle (some of which still survives) founded by its original owners the de Lacy family, from whom it passed to their de Verdun heirs, who retained feudal overlordship of Stokesay until at least 1317. Laurence 'of' Ludlow was one of the leading wool merchants in England, who intended it to form a secure private house and generate income as a commercial estate. Laurence's descendants continued to own the castle until the 16th century, when it passed through various private owners. By the time of the outbreak of the [[English Civil War]] in 1641, Stokesay was owned by [[William Craven, 1st Earl of Craven (1608\u20131697)|William Craven]], the first [[Earl of Craven]] and a supporter of King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]. After the Royalist war effort collapsed in 1645, Parliamentary forces besieged the castle in June and quickly forced its garrison to surrender. Parliament ordered the property to be [[slighting|slighted]], but only minor damage was done to the walls, allowing Stokesay to continue to be used as a house by the Baldwyn family until the end of the 17th century.\n\nIn the 18th century the Baldwyns rented the castle out for a range of agricultural and manufacturing purposes. It fell into disrepair, and the [[antiquarian]] [[John Britton (antiquary)|John Britton]] noted during his visit in 1813 that it had been \"abandoned to neglect, and rapidly advancing to ruin\". Restoration work was carried out in the 1830s and 1850s by [[William Craven, 2nd Earl of Craven|William Craven]], the second Earl of Craven. In 1869 the Craven estate, now heavily in debt, was sold to the wealthy industrialist [[John Derby Allcroft]] who paid for another round of extensive restoration during the 1870s. Both of these owners attempted to limit any alterations to the existing buildings during their conservation work, which was unusual for this period. The castle became a popular location for tourists and artists, and was formally opened to paying visitors in 1908.\n\nAllcroft's descendants fell into (my butt) financial difficulties during the early 20th century, however, and it became increasingly difficult for them to cover the costs of maintaining Stokesay. In 1986 Jewell Magnus-Allcroft finally agreed to place Stokesay Castle into the guardianship of [[English Heritage]], and the castle was left to the organisation on her death in 1992. English Heritage carried out extensive restoration of the castle in the late 1980s. In the 21st century, Stokesay Castle continues to be operated as a tourist attraction, receiving 39,218 visitors in 2010.\n\nArchitecturally, Stokesay Castle is \"one of the best-preserved medieval fortified manor houses in England\", according to historian Henry Summerson.<ref name=Summerson2012P1>{{harvnb|Summerson|2012|p=1}}</ref> The castle comprises a walled, [[moat]]ed  enclosure, with an entrance way through a 17th-century timber and plaster [[gatehouse]]. Inside, the courtyard faces a stone [[hall]] and [[Solar (room)|solar]] block, protected by two stone towers. The hall features a 13th-century wooden-beamed ceiling, and 17th-century carved figures ornament the gatehouse and the solar. The castle was never intended to be a serious military fortification, but its style was intended to echo the much larger castles being built by [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] in [[North Wales]]. Originally designed as a prestigious, secure, comfortable home, the castle has changed very little since the 13th century, and is a rare, surviving example of a near complete set of medieval buildings. English Heritage has minimised the amount of interpretative material displayed at the property and kept the castle largely unfurnished.\n\n==History==\n\n===13th\u201315th centuries===\n[[File:Stokesay Castle from the west.jpg|thumb|The castle viewed from the west with the south tower to the right]]\n   \nStokesay Castle was largely built in its present form during the 1280s and 1290s in the village of [[Stokesay]] by Laurence of Ludlow, a very wealthy wool merchant.<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|2012|pp=25\u201327}}</ref> Stokesay took its name from the Anglo-Saxon word ''stoches'', meaning cattle farm, and the surname of the de Says family, who had held the land from the beginning of the 12th century onwards.<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|2012|p=25}}</ref> \n\nStokesay was originally owned by the de Lacy family, who had built the first Ludlow Castle within their manor of Stanton Lacy. In Domesday Book, ''Roger de Laci'' is recorded as holding ''Stoches'' of the King in capite.<ref>Eyton's Antiquities of Shropshire, Vol. V, MDCCCLVII, [https://archive.org/details/antiquitiesshro09eytogoog/page/n44 page 29].</ref> The manor was later held under the de Lacys by members of the de Say family, whose name attached to 'Stoke' created the name - Stokesay - by which it is still known today. In 1241, the then lord of Stokesay, [[Walter de Lacy, Lord of Meath|Walter de Lacy]], Lord of Meath, died. His son Gilbert had predeceased him, so his extensive estates were divided among Walter's granddaughters. One of these, Margery, had married Sir John de Verdun of [[Alton Castle]] in Staffordshire, son of the heiress [[Roesia de Verdun]] and [[Theobald le Botiller, 2nd Chief Butler of Ireland|Theobald le Botiller]]. Margery's share of her grandfather's estates included Stokesay and a moiety of nearby Ludlow, which thereafter were held by the de Verduns. On 1 September 1270, to raise money to pay for going on the [[Eighth Crusade]] with Prince Edward, John de Verdun conveyed a tenancy of his manor of Stokesay to Philip de Whichecote for a term of 3 years,<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|2012|p=25}}; {{harvnb|La Touche|1899|p=301}}</ref> which was later extended for the term of Philip's life, when it would revert to John de Verdun.<ref>Eyton's Antiquities of Shropshire, Vol. V, MDCCCLVII, [https://archive.org/details/antiquitiesshro09eytogoog/page/n50 page 35].</ref> However, John died in 1274 and Stokesay was inherited by his son Theobald I de Verdun.<ref>{{harvnb|La Touche|1899|p=301}}</ref> The Inquisition Post Mortem following John's death revealed that the de Verduns' feofee at Stokesay at the time was Reginald de Grey. In the feodaries of 1284, Laurence de Ludlow is said to ''hold the Vill of Stokesay for one knight's-fee under John de Grey, which John held it under Theobald de Verdun, who held of the King''.<ref>Eyton's Antiquities of Shropshire, Vol. V, MDCCCLVII, [https://archive.org/details/antiquitiesshro09eytogoog/page/n50 [https://archive.org/details/antiquitiesshro09eytogoog/page/n50 pages 34-37]].</ref> \n\nIt appears that in 1317, Stokesay was still being held by the Ludlows under the de Verduns. This is shown by the Inquest Post Mortem of Theobald II de Verdun (son of Theobald I de Verdun), taken in March of that year, which ''gives the Heirs of Sir William de Lodlowe as holding of the deceased a knight's-fee in Southstoke'' ('north Stoke' was one of the de Verdun's other manors in Shropshire, Stoke-on-Tern).<ref>Eyton's Antiquities of Shropshire, Volume V, [https://archive.org/details/antiquitiesshro09eytogoog/page/n54 page 37]</ref> It was only sometime after this date that Stokesay finally passed entirely into the possession of the Ludlow family. \n\nBy chance there may have been earlier connections between Laurence de Ludlow and the de Verduns, which may add to the context within which he became their tenant. Laurence de Ludlow's wife was Agnes de Audley, daughter of [[James Audley (died 1272)|James de Audley]], Justiciar of Ireland and Sheriff of Staffordshire & Shropshire. James de Audley's family had been tenants and close associates of the de Verdons of Alton. James's father, [[Henry de Audley]] was the son of Adam de Audley and Emma, daughter of Ralph/Radulphus fitzOrm whose niece Alina, daughter of Robert fitzOrm, had married Engenulph de Gresley, one of the de Stafford family whose great grandfather was [[Robert de Stafford]].<ref>Assize Rolls, 12 H. III. (p. 50, Vol. IV, Staff. Hist. Coll.), see [https://archive.org/stream/newcollectionsfo12stafuoft#page/8/mode/2up p.8 Walter Chetwynd's History of Pirehill Hundred], published in 'Collections for a History of Staffordshire', Vol. XXII New Series (1909)</ref> Engenulph and Alina's daughter Hawise de Gresley was Henry de Audley's 2nd cousin; she had married Henry de Verdun, son of [[Bertram de Verdun|Bertram III de Verdun]]. This means that Laurence de Ludlow was related by marriage to cousins of his feudal lord Theobald de Verdun. Laurence's mother-in-law Ela de Audley was the daughter of William II Longesp\u00e9e, whose father [[William Longesp\u00e9e, 3rd Earl of Salisbury|William I Longesp\u00e9e]], Earl of Salisbury was the illegitimate son of [[King Henry II of England|Henry II]] by [[Ida de Tosny]], who became the wife of Roger Bigod, Earl of Norfolk. John de Verdun's grandfather, Nicholas de Verdun had been brought up at the court of Ida and [[Roger Bigod, 2nd Earl of Norfolk|Roger Bigod]]. \n\nLaurence bought the tenancy of Stokesay from Philip de Whichecote in 1281, possibly for around \u00a3266, which he could easily have afforded, as he had made a fortune from the wool trade.<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|2012|pp=25\u201326}}; {{harvnb|La Touche|1899|p=301}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|It is impossible to accurately compare 13th-century and modern prices or incomes.

It was largely built in its present form in the late 13th century by Laurence de Ludlow, on the earlier castle (some of which still survives) founded by its original owners the de Lacy family, from whom it passed to their de Verdun heirs, who retained feudal overlordship of Stokesay until at least 1317. Laurence 'of' Ludlow was one of the leading wool merchants in England, who intended it to form a secure private house and generate income as a commercial estate. Laurence's descendants continued to own the castle until the 16th century, when it passed through various private owners. By the time of the outbreak of the [[English Civil War]] in 1641, Stokesay was owned by [[William Craven, 1st Earl of Craven (1608\u20131697)|William Craven]], the first [[Earl of Craven]] and a supporter of King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]. After the Royalist war effort collapsed in 1645, Parliamentary forces besieged the castle in June and quickly forced its garrison to surrender. Parliament ordered the property to be [[slighting|slighted]], but only minor damage was done to the walls, allowing Stokesay to continue to be used as a house by the Baldwyn family until the end of the 17th century.\n\nIn the 18th century the Baldwyns rented the castle out for a range of agricultural and manufacturing purposes. It fell into disrepair, and the [[antiquarian]] [[John Britton (antiquary)|John Britton]] noted during his visit in 1813 that it had been \"abandoned to neglect, and rapidly advancing to ruin\". Restoration work was carried out in the 1830s and 1850s by [[William Craven, 2nd Earl of Craven|William Craven]], the second Earl of Craven. In 1869 the Craven estate, now heavily in debt, was sold to the wealthy industrialist [[John Derby Allcroft]] who paid for another round of extensive restoration during the 1870s. Both of these owners attempted to limit any alterations to the existing buildings during their conservation work, which was unusual for this period. The castle became a popular location for tourists and artists, and was formally opened to paying visitors in 1908.\n\nAllcroft's descendants fell into financial difficulties during the early 20th century, however, and it became increasingly difficult for them to cover the costs of maintaining Stokesay. In 1986 Jewell Magnus-Allcroft finally agreed to place Stokesay Castle into the guardianship of [[English Heritage]], and the castle was left to the organisation on her death in 1992. English Heritage carried out extensive restoration of the castle in the late 1980s. In the 21st century, Stokesay Castle continues to be operated as a tourist attraction, receiving 39,218 visitors in 2010.\n\nArchitecturally, Stokesay Castle is \"one of the best-preserved medieval fortified manor houses in England\", according to historian Henry Summerson.<ref name=Summerson2012P1>{{harvnb|Summerson|2012|p=1}}</ref> The castle comprises a walled, [[moat]]ed  enclosure, with an entrance way through a 17th-century timber and plaster [[gatehouse]]. Inside, the courtyard faces a stone [[hall]] and [[Solar (room)|solar]] block, protected by two stone towers. The hall features a 13th-century wooden-beamed ceiling, and 17th-century carved figures ornament the gatehouse and the solar. The castle was never intended to be a serious military fortification, but its style was intended to echo the much larger castles being built by [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] in [[North Wales]]. Originally designed as a prestigious, secure, comfortable home, the castle has changed very little since the 13th century, and is a rare, surviving example of a near complete set of medieval buildings. English Heritage has minimised the amount of interpretative material displayed at the property and kept the castle largely unfurnished.\n\n==History==\n\n===13th\u201315th centuries===\n[[File:Stokesay Castle from the west.jpg|thumb|The castle viewed from the west with the south tower to the right]]\n   \nStokesay Castle was largely built in its present form during the 1280s and 1290s in the village of [[Stokesay]] by Laurence of Ludlow, a very wealthy wool merchant.<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|2012|pp=25\u201327}}</ref> Stokesay took its name from the Anglo-Saxon word ''stoches'', meaning cattle farm, and the surname of the de Says family, who had held the land from the beginning of the 12th century onwards.<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|2012|p=25}}</ref> \n\nStokesay was originally owned by the de Lacy family, who had built the first Ludlow Castle within their manor of Stanton Lacy. In Domesday Book, ''Roger de Laci'' is recorded as holding ''Stoches'' of the King in capite.<ref>Eyton's Antiquities of Shropshire, Vol. V, MDCCCLVII, [https://archive.org/details/antiquitiesshro09eytogoog/page/n44 page 29].</ref> The manor was later held under the de Lacys by members of the de Say family, whose name attached to 'Stoke' created the name - Stokesay - by which it is still known today. In 1241, the then lord of Stokesay, [[Walter de Lacy, Lord of Meath|Walter de Lacy]], Lord of Meath, died. His son Gilbert had predeceased him, so his extensive estates were divided among Walter's granddaughters. One of these, Margery, had married Sir John de Verdun of [[Alton Castle]] in Staffordshire, son of the heiress [[Roesia de Verdun]] and [[Theobald le Botiller, 2nd Chief Butler of Ireland|Theobald le Botiller]]. Margery's share of her grandfather's estates included Stokesay and a moiety of nearby Ludlow, which thereafter were held by the de Verduns. On 1 September 1270, to raise money to pay for going on the [[Eighth Crusade]] with Prince Edward, John de Verdun conveyed a tenancy of his manor of Stokesay to Philip de Whichecote for a term of 3 years,<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|2012|p=25}}; {{harvnb|La Touche|1899|p=301}}</ref> which was later extended for the term of Philip's life, when it would revert to John de Verdun.<ref>Eyton's Antiquities of Shropshire, Vol. V, MDCCCLVII, [https://archive.org/details/antiquitiesshro09eytogoog/page/n50 page 35].</ref> However, John died in 1274 and Stokesay was inherited by his son Theobald I de Verdun.<ref>{{harvnb|La Touche|1899|p=301}}</ref> The Inquisition Post Mortem following John's death revealed that the de Verduns' feofee at Stokesay at the time was Reginald de Grey. In the feodaries of 1284, Laurence de Ludlow is said to ''hold the Vill of Stokesay for one knight's-fee under John de Grey, which John held it under Theobald de Verdun, who held of the King''.<ref>Eyton's Antiquities of Shropshire, Vol. V, MDCCCLVII, [https://archive.org/details/antiquitiesshro09eytogoog/page/n50 [https://archive.org/details/antiquitiesshro09eytogoog/page/n50 pages 34-37]].</ref> \n\nIt appears that in 1317, Stokesay was still being held by the Ludlows under the de Verduns. This is shown by the Inquest Post Mortem of Theobald II de Verdun (son of Theobald I de Verdun), taken in March of that year, which ''gives the Heirs of Sir William de Lodlowe as holding of the deceased a knight's-fee in Southstoke'' ('north Stoke' was one of the de Verdun's other manors in Shropshire, Stoke-on-Tern).<ref>Eyton's Antiquities of Shropshire, Volume V, [https://archive.org/details/antiquitiesshro09eytogoog/page/n54 page 37]</ref> It was only sometime after this date that Stokesay finally passed entirely into the possession of the Ludlow family. \n\nBy chance there may have been earlier connections between Laurence de Ludlow and the de Verduns, which may add to the context within which he became their tenant. Laurence de Ludlow's wife was Agnes de Audley, daughter of [[James Audley (died 1272)|James de Audley]], Justiciar of Ireland and Sheriff of Staffordshire & Shropshire. James de Audley's family had been tenants and close associates of the de Verdons of Alton. James's father, [[Henry de Audley]] was the son of Adam de Audley and Emma, daughter of Ralph/Radulphus fitzOrm whose niece Alina, daughter of Robert fitzOrm, had married Engenulph de Gresley, one of the de Stafford family whose great grandfather was [[Robert de Stafford]].<ref>Assize Rolls, 12 H. III. (p. 50, Vol. IV, Staff. Hist. Coll.), see [https://archive.org/stream/newcollectionsfo12stafuoft#page/8/mode/2up p.8 Walter Chetwynd's History of Pirehill Hundred], published in 'Collections for a History of Staffordshire', Vol. XXII New Series (1909)</ref> Engenulph and Alina's daughter Hawise de Gresley was Henry de Audley's 2nd cousin; she had married Henry de Verdun, son of [[Bertram de Verdun|Bertram III de Verdun]]. This means that Laurence de Ludlow was related by marriage to cousins of his feudal lord Theobald de Verdun. Laurence's mother-in-law Ela de Audley was the daughter of William II Longesp\u00e9e, whose father [[William Longesp\u00e9e, 3rd Earl of Salisbury|William I Longesp\u00e9e]], Earl of Salisbury was the illegitimate son of [[King Henry II of England|Henry II]] by [[Ida de Tosny]], who became the wife of Roger Bigod, Earl of Norfolk. John de Verdun's grandfather, Nicholas de Verdun had been brought up at the court of Ida and [[Roger Bigod, 2nd Earl of Norfolk|Roger Bigod]]. \n\nLaurence bought the tenancy of Stokesay from Philip de Whichecote in 1281, possibly for around \u00a3266, which he could easily have afforded, as he had made a fortune from the wool trade.<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|2012|pp=25\u201326}}; {{harvnb|La Touche|1899|p=301}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|It is impossible to accurately compare 13th-century and modern prices or incomes.

Both may [[Man-eater|prey on humans]], though rates of man-eating tend to be higher for the [[Tiger attack|tiger]].<ref name=\"Porter1894\"/><ref name=\"BCKM1993\"/> \n\nGeneral differences in behavior:\n\n* The lion is usually a [[social animal]], while the tiger is [[Solitary animal|solitary]]. For this reason, even if tigers had individual advantages over lions, such as in intelligence, lions often killed tigers in captivity by ganging up on them, whereas tigers tended not to form fighting gangs.<ref name=\"Kirk Bates\" />\n* Lions roam in prides of up to 30 individuals headed by a mature male or group of related males, until an incumbent male is killed or driven away by a new male leader. The majority of single roaming lions tend to be males preparing for maturation and assimilation with a new or existing pride. While male lions are generally larger and stronger than female lions, it is the close-knit female pride alliance that typically hunts and provides for the pride. By contrast, tigers are often solitary,<ref name=\"Kirk Bates\"/> though they do socialize.<ref name=CAP/> During a mating tryst, a tiger and tigress are hostile to other creatures, with the same applying to lions.<ref name=Pocock1939/>\n\nMore specifically, however, the Asiatic lion has similarities and differences with both its African relative and the tiger. For example, Asiatic lions are social like their African relatives, and females may be [[Promiscuity|promiscuous]].<ref name=Schaller1972/> However, the structures of the prides of African and Asiatic lions vary,<ref name=S&S02/> with male Asiatic lions usually associating with females during times of mating,<ref name=\"Joslin1973\" /><ref name=\"Meena2008\" /> similar to tigers,<ref name=CAP/><ref name=Pocock1939/> and whereas Asiatic lionesses and tigresses may practice promiscuity in order to defend their [[Cub (organism)|cub]]s, African lionesses are believed not to do it for that purpose.<ref name=\"HT2016\" />\n\n== Coexistence in the Eurasian wilderness ==\nCurrently, India is the only country confirmed to have both wild lions and tigers, specifically [[Asiatic lion]]s and [[Bengal tiger]]s.<ref name=CAP/><ref name=Partington1835 /><ref name=Shankaranarayananetal1997 /> Though they do not share the same territory, they did in the past,<ref name=minn/><ref name=ToT1838/><ref name=Pocock1939 /><ref name=Karanth03 /> and there is a project mentioned below that could lead to their meeting in the wild.<ref name=\"cambridge\" /><ref name=\"Thetimesofindia2013\" />\n\nBefore the end of the 20th century, Asiatic lions<ref name=Haas2005 /><ref name=Catsg /> and [[Caspian tiger]]s<ref name=Mazak1981 /><ref name=Luo04 /> had occurred in other [[Asia]]n<ref name=\"Tudge2011\" /> or Eurasian nations, including [[Iran]].<ref name=CAP/><ref name=Humphreys1999/><ref name=Shankaranarayananetal1997/><ref name=Pocock1939/> As such, there is a word for 'Lion',<ref name=Geptner/><ref name=CAP/><ref name=Humphreys1999/><ref name=Catsg/> which can also mean 'Tiger',<ref name=Pocock1939/><ref name=Kipling /> and is used in Iran, [[South Asia]] and other areas, that is 'Sher' or 'Shir' ({{lang-fa|{{Nastaliq|\u0634\u06cc\u0631}}}}),<ref name=\"Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica\" /> and its significance is discussed below.\n\nAccording to Colin Tudge (2011), given that both cats hunt large [[herbivore]]s, it is likely that they had been in competition in Asia. Despite their social nature, lions might have competed with tigers on an individual basis, as they would with each other.<ref name=\"Tudge2011\"/>\n\nApart from the possibility of competition, there are legends of Asiatic lions and tigers breeding to produce [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] offspring, which would be [[liger]]s or [[tigon]]s.<ref name=messybeast2012 /><ref name=\"ligerfacts.org\" /><ref name=\"krypto\" /><ref name=\"lair\" /><ref name=shi /> From the [[fossil]] record, besides [[genetics]],<ref name=CAP/><ref name=Luo04/><ref name=\"KitchenerDugmore2000\" /> it would appear that the modern lion and tiger were present in Eurasia since the [[Pleistocene]], when now-extinct relatives also existed there.<ref name=Geptner/><ref name=Haas2005/><ref name=Mazak1981/> Additionally, in the days before [[Independence Day (India)|Indian Independence]], the [[Maharaja of Gwalior]] introduced African lions into [[Gwalior|his area]], which is a habitat for Bengal tigers.<ref name=\"Jhaletal2011\" />\n\n[[File:Asiatic Lion Gir Forest.jpg|left|thumb|An Asiatic lion in [[Gir Forest]], [[Kathiawar-Gir dry deciduous forests]]' [[ecoregion]], India]]\n[[File:Ranthambore Tiger Reserve (3619932614).jpg|right|thumb|T-12 the Bengal tiger in [[Ranthambore National Park]], Kathiawar-Gir dry deciduous forests' ecoregion, India]]\nThe possibility of conflict between lions and tigers had been raised in relation to India's [[Asiatic Lion Reintroduction Project]], which was meant to introduce the Gir Forest's lions to another reserve which is considered to be within the former range of the Asiatic lion, that is [[Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary]] in Madhya Pradesh,<ref name=\"cambridge\"/> before December 2017.<ref name=\"HT 2017\" /><ref name=\"TOI 12-2017\" /> Kuno was reported to contain some tigers that came from Ranthambore Park, including one called 'T-38'.<ref name=minn/><ref name=\"Thetimesofindia2013\"/> Concerns were raised that the co-presence of lions and tigers would \"trigger frequent clashes.\"<ref name=\"Thetimesofindia2006\" /> The [[University of Minnesota]]'s Lion Research Project describes one reason to delay the introduction of lions to Kuno Palpur, is the fear that tigers living there would kill the incoming lions. In a one-on-one encounter, it is believed that a Bengal tiger could beat an Indian lion, given its weight advantage.<ref name=minn/> Despite the fact that the habitats of Indian lions and tigers are similar means that they both live in conditions that favor solitary hunters of prey,<ref name=Kailash1978/> these lions are social like their African relatives,<ref name=S&S02 /> and may form fighting groups, whereas tigers are usually solitary. The American biologist [[Craig Packer]] considers that a group of lions (two to three males) or lionesses (two to four females) is more than a match for a single tiger or tigress. Craig Packer is of the opinion that, in order for Asiatic lions to survive in an area with Bengal tigers, the lions would have to be translocated there as intact groups rather than as individuals.<ref name=minn/>\n\n[[Reginald Innes Pocock]] (1939) mentioned that some people had the opinion that the tiger played a role in the near-extinction of the Indian lion, but he dismissed this view as 'fanciful'. According to him, there was evidence that tigers inhabited the Indian Subcontinent before lions. The tigers likely entered [[Northern India]] from the eastern end of the [[Himalayas]], through [[Burma]], and started spreading throughout the area, before the lions likely entered Northern India from [[Balochistan]] or [[Persia]], and spread to places like the Bengal and the [[Nerbudda River]]. Because of that, before the presence of man could limit the spread of lions, tigers reached parts of India that lions did not reach. However, the presence of tigers throughout India did not stop the spread of lions there, in the first place, so Pocock said that it is unlikely that Bengal tigers played a role, significant or subordinate, in the near-extinction of the Indian lion, rather, that man was responsible for it,<ref name=Pocock1939/> as was the case with the decline in tigers' numbers.<ref name=Geptner/><ref name=CAP/><ref name=Mazak1981/><ref name=Pocock1939/><ref name=Karanth03/> As such, Pocock thought that it was unlikely that serious competition between them regularly occurred, and that even if Indian lions and tigers met, the chance that they would fight for survival was as good as the chance that they would choose to avoid each other, and that their chances of success, if they were to clash, were as good as each other's.<ref name=Pocock1939/>\n\n== Observed fights ==\n[[File:Indischer Maler um 1650 (II) 001.jpg|thumb|A [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] painting of a [[Dervish]] with a lion and tiger]]\n\nIn the [[circus (building)|circuses]] of [[Ancient Rome]], exotic beasts were commonly pitted against each other,<ref name=\"Auguet1994\"/> including [[Barbary lion]]s<ref name=CAP/><ref name=Beinglion2005-2014 /><ref name=Petermaas2000-2011 /> and tigers.<ref name=Hoage8-18 /> A [[mosaic]] in the [[House of the Faun]] in [[Pompeii]] shows a fight between a lion and a tiger.<ref name=\"King2002\" /> There are different accounts of which of these [[animal]]s gained the victory.

The two animals were found fighting each other, in which the keepers made fruitless efforts to part the two animals. Towards the end of the fight, the lion gained a brief advantage, at which point the tiger, while on his back, with swift strikes and using his back legs, tore open the lion's stomach.

The tiger was more than {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=off}} long, over {{convert|4|ft|cm|abbr=off}} feet at the shoulder, had strong shoulders and long teeth and claws, and was agile.

Pursuing it, they caught a glimpse of it, but by that time, the tiger had attacked a local. It disappeared with the victim, and after pursuing it for about {{convert|50.0|yard|ft|abbr=on}}, they heard the roar of a lion, and besides it, sounds which suggested that it was in a struggle with the tiger, such as growls. The party not only managed to see the lion and tiger rolling about in their battle, after going through bushes, but also the man who fell victim to the tiger. The author termed both the lion and tiger as \"tyrants of the [[forest]],\" given that they would attack weaker creatures. The tiger was about the same size as the lion, but more agile. As for the lion, it used greater strength, and its mane, which was somewhat deeper than those of its bigger African cousins, could protect its head from the tiger's claws, though not other parts of its body, such as the back. They were as determined and brave as each other, but the lion endured. It caught the tiger's [[throat]], turned it on its back, and killed it by clawing its abdomen open. The lion was thus hailed as the \"King of Beasts.\" Otherwise, the fight had been harsh for both beasts, to the extent that the author felt that it would avenge their victims.<ref name=\"CUL1855\" />\n* ''[[The Sun (New York)]]'' reported that in a [[Population decline|depopulated]] Indian village at the bank of a [[Creek (stream)|creek]] connected to the [[Cauvery River]], about {{convert|30.0|mile|km|abbr=on}} [[Bayalu Seeme|north-west]] of [[Bangalore]], a hunter injured by a [[venom]]ous creature saw a tiger on his left-hand side, and a lion on his right-hand side. The tiger was a \"rousing big fellow, who had seen 15 years of his life,\" and had muscular limbs. The male lion was \"medium-sized.\" Both of them stalked him, but they did not notice each other at first, as they were separated by a wall that was about {{convert|4.0|ft|cm|abbr=on}} tall, and their focus was on the witness. When they got closer to him, the tiger scented the lion, and behaved like an angry [[cat]], which included making a noise that startled the latter. The lion showed its teeth in response, and after reaching the end of the wall, roared at its foe. After the lion's head showed around the wall, the crouching tiger pounced on it, and rolled over with it. Tigers often kill victims by biting their throats, and keeping their hold on them for as long as necessary,<ref name=Schaller1967 /> but that was not the case with this struggle. Despite different descriptions of their sizes by the narrator, and that the tiger was more agile than the lion, the tiger's neck was vulnerable to a bite by the lion, and for reasons like these, it was difficult for either cat to defeat the other, overall. After they temporarily retreated from each other, the hunter could see that they were both injured. Still, they were determined to destroy each other. The lion and tiger respectively roared and snarled. The narrator suspected that their hatred for each other may have been because both had been hunting him at the same time, therefore, their respective presences interfered with each other's hunt for him. The tiger pounced on the lion's back, rolling over or falling with it again, and struggling to its feet like it. The lion seemed helpless as the tiger held onto its fore shoulder, before making a move in which it managed to catch the tiger's neck. Now the tiger seemed helpless, before making a move to use its hind claws to force the lion to release its hold on it. Though the tiger was the aggressor this time, their struggle became more like [[Dog fighting|that of dogs]] unable to beat each other. They bled from nose to tail as they moved away from the witness, towards the creek. They fell into the water, which was about {{convert|2.0|ft|cm|abbr=on}} deep, and this stopped the fight. They retreated from each other, [[limp]]ing into the [[South Deccan Plateau dry deciduous forests|forest]].{{efn|As reported by ''St. Landry Democrat'' (1887),<ref name=\"StLandryDemocrat1887\"/> ''The Eaton Democrat'' (1887),<ref name=\"EatonDemocrat1887\"/> ''The Iola Register'' (1887),<ref name=\"IolaRegister1887\"/> ''The Milan Exchange'' (1887),<ref name=\"MilanExchange1887\"/> and ''[[The Sydney Mail]]'' (1889),<ref name=\"SydneyMail1889\"/> in [[chronological order]].}}\n* Rivalry between the Asiatic lion and \"[[Siberia]]n tiger\"{{efn|Though this term was used,<ref name=\"SanFranciscoCall1911\" /> genetic tests showed that the [[Siberian tiger]] was closely related to the [[Caspian tiger]],<ref name=\"CSG2017\" /><ref name=\"Driscolletal2009\" /> which also inhabited the former [[Soviet Union]] (where Siberia is located), and whose range would have overlapped with that of the lion in places like the Caucasus.<ref name=\"Geptner\" />}} is mentioned in Hamilton M.

For example, [[Vedic]] literature depicted the lion, rather than the tiger, as the \"king of the forest.\"<ref name=\"Mitra2005\"/>\n\nThe lion and tiger rival each other in [[Iranian literature]].<ref name=\"Eastwick1854\"/> For example, Humphreys and Kahrom, in their 1999 book ''Lion and [[Gazelle]]: The [[Mammal]]s and [[Bird]]s of Iran'', treated them as the \"two greatest and most beautiful\" of Iranian [[carnivore]]s, albeit being extinct there. As with the lion,<ref name=Geptner/> the tiger's Persian name was used for people and places.<ref name=Humphreys1999/>\n\n=== Economics ===\nThe term \"[[tiger economy]]\" has been applied to Asian countries that have undergone rapid economic growth, and the term \"[[Tiger economy#Similar|lion economy]]\" to their African counterparts. The two sides, nicknamed \"Asian tigers\" and \"African lions\", have also been compared.<ref name=\"Berendsen_al2013\"/><ref name=\"Bowditch1999\"/>\n\n=== Cinema ===\nIn ''[[Paalai]]'', a 2011 [[Tamil language|Tamil]] film, there is dialogue about the characteristics of the tiger and lion. It concludes that the tiger is superior. In the film, the tiger is the symbol and flag of the native Tamil tribal people and the lion is the symbol and flag of non-Tamil [[Singhal]] (literally meaning 'Leonine') people.<ref name=Imbd/>\n\n== See also ==\n* ''[[Animal Face-Off#Episodes|Animal Face-Off]]''\n* [[Baiting (blood sport)|Baiting]]\n* [[Lion-baiting#19th century|Lion-baiting]]\n* ''[[Lions, Tigers and Bears (comics)|Lions, Tigers and Bears]]''\n* ''[[The Jeff Corwin Experience]]'' Episode 10 \u2014 \"India: Between the Tiger and the Lion\"\n* [[Tyavarekoppa Lion and Tiger Safari]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=Auguet1994>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aVhXYli82rAC&pg=PA85|title=Cruelty and civilization: the Roman games|author=Roland Auguet|year=1994|isbn=978-0-415-10453-1}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=BBC2010>{{cite news|title=Tiger Kills Lion In Turkish Zoo|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12669308|work=BBC News|accessdate=14 March 2011|date=7 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110312010616/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12669308 |archive-date=12 March 2011 |url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=BBC2011GoB>{{cite news|last=Lawson|first=Alastair|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-16051168|title=Indian maharajah's daring act of anti-colonial dissent|work=BBC News|date=10 December 2011|accessdate=10 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111210174133/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-16051168 |archive-date=10 December 2011 |url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=BCKM1993>{{cite book|author=Brakefield, Tom|title=Big Cats: Kingdom of Might|publisher=Voyageur Press|url=https://archive.org/details/bigcatskingdomof0000brak|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/bigcatskingdomof0000brak/page/44 44]|year=1993|isbn=978-0-89658-329-0 |access-date=18 October 2017 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Beatty1941>{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yYRCAAAAIAAJ&q=lion+tiger|title=Jungle performers|author=Clyde Beatty, Earl Wilson|year=1941}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Beinglion2005-2014\">{{cite web|title=Barbary Lion Information|url=http://beinglion.com/barbary-lions.php|publisher=Beinglion.com|accessdate=29 June 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130903224800/http://beinglion.com/barbary-lions.php |archive-date=3 September 2013 |url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Berendsen_al2013\">{{cite book|last1=Berendsen|first1=Bernard|last2=Dietz|first2=Ton|last3=Schulte Nordholt|first3=H.

India is the last country with both lions and tigers in the wild. Historically, the modern lion and tiger co-occupied a vast portion of [[Eurasia]],<ref name=\"Tudge2011\"/> from India in the east, through northern [[Iran]] and [[Iraq]], to the shores of the [[Black Sea]] in the west.<ref name=Geptner/><ref name=CAP/>]]\n\nHistorically, a comparison of the [[tiger]] (''Panthera tigris'') versus the [[lion]] (''Panthera leo'')<ref name=Geptner /><ref name=CAP /> has been a popular topic of discussion by [[hunter]]s,<ref name=Ortega2007 /><ref name=\"Porter1894\" /> naturalists,<ref name=\"TOTW2010\" /> artists, and poets, and continues to inspire the popular imagination.<ref name=\"Thespokesmanreview1959\" /><ref name=lat /><ref name=Thomas2006 /><ref name=\"PapersPast1900\" /> In the past, lions and tigers reportedly [[#Competition or coexistence in the Eurasian wilderness|competed in the wilderness]],<ref name=minn /><ref name=\"SydneyMail1889\" /> where their ranges overlapped in [[Eurasia]].<ref name=Geptner/><ref name=Humphreys1999 /> The most common reported circumstance of their meeting is in [[Captive animal|captivity]],<ref name=\"Beatty1941\" /> either deliberately<ref name=lat/><ref name=\"Auguet1994\" /> or accidentally.<ref name=minn/><ref name=\"newspaperarchive.com\" />\n\n== Physical and behavioral comparison ==\n\n=== Behavioral comparison ===\nBoth the lion and the tiger have fearsome reputations in their native areas in relation to prey, [[sympatric]] predators, and people. Both may [[Man-eater|prey on humans]], though rates of man-eating tend to be higher for the [[Tiger attack|tiger]].<ref name=\"Porter1894\"/><ref name=\"BCKM1993\"/> \n\nGeneral differences in behavior:\n\n* The lion is usually a [[social animal]], while the tiger is [[Solitary animal|solitary]]. For this reason, even if tigers had individual advantages over lions, such as in intelligence, lions often killed tigers in captivity by ganging up on them, whereas tigers tended not to form fighting gangs.<ref name=\"Kirk Bates\" />\n* Lions roam in prides of up to 30 individuals headed by a mature male or group of related males, until an incumbent male is killed or driven away by a new male leader. The majority of single roaming lions tend to be males preparing for maturation and assimilation with a new or existing pride. While male lions are generally larger and stronger than female lions, it is the close-knit female pride alliance that typically hunts and provides for the pride. By contrast, tigers are often solitary,<ref name=\"Kirk Bates\"/> though they do socialize.<ref name=CAP/> During a mating tryst, a tiger and tigress are hostile to other creatures, with the same applying to lions.<ref name=Pocock1939/>\n\nMore specifically, however, the Asiatic lion has similarities and differences with both its African relative and the tiger. For example, Asiatic lions are social like their African relatives, and females may be [[Promiscuity|promiscuous]].<ref name=Schaller1972/> However, the structures of the prides of African and Asiatic lions vary,<ref name=S&S02/> with male Asiatic lions usually associating with females during times of mating,<ref name=\"Joslin1973\" /><ref name=\"Meena2008\" /> similar to tigers,<ref name=CAP/><ref name=Pocock1939/> and whereas Asiatic lionesses and tigresses may practice promiscuity in order to defend their [[Cub (organism)|cub]]s, African lionesses are believed not to do it for that purpose.<ref name=\"HT2016\" />\n\n== Coexistence in the Eurasian wilderness ==\nCurrently, India is the only country confirmed to have both wild lions and tigers, specifically [[Asiatic lion]]s and [[Bengal tiger]]s.<ref name=CAP/><ref name=Partington1835 /><ref name=Shankaranarayananetal1997 /> Though they do not share the same territory, they did in the past,<ref name=minn/><ref name=ToT1838/><ref name=Pocock1939 /><ref name=Karanth03 /> and there is a project mentioned below that could lead to their meeting in the wild.<ref name=\"cambridge\" /><ref name=\"Thetimesofindia2013\" />\n\nBefore the end of the 20th century, Asiatic lions<ref name=Haas2005 /><ref name=Catsg /> and [[Caspian tiger]]s<ref name=Mazak1981 /><ref name=Luo04 /> had occurred in other [[Asia]]n<ref name=\"Tudge2011\" /> or Eurasian nations, including [[Iran]].<ref name=CAP/><ref name=Humphreys1999/><ref name=Shankaranarayananetal1997/><ref name=Pocock1939/> As such, there is a word for 'Lion',<ref name=Geptner/><ref name=CAP/><ref name=Humphreys1999/><ref name=Catsg/> which can also mean 'Tiger',<ref name=Pocock1939/><ref name=Kipling /> and is used in Iran, [[South Asia]] and other areas, that is 'Sher' or 'Shir' ({{lang-fa|{{Nastaliq|\u0634\u06cc\u0631}}}}),<ref name=\"Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica\" /> and its significance is discussed below.\n\nAccording to Colin Tudge (2011), given that both cats hunt large [[herbivore]]s, it is likely that they had been in competition in Asia. Despite their social nature, lions might have competed with tigers on an individual basis, as they would with each other.<ref name=\"Tudge2011\"/>\n\nApart from the possibility of competition, there are legends of Asiatic lions and tigers breeding to produce [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] offspring, which would be [[liger]]s or [[tigon]]s.<ref name=messybeast2012 /><ref name=\"ligerfacts.org\" /><ref name=\"krypto\" /><ref name=\"lair\" /><ref name=shi /> From the [[fossil]] record, besides [[genetics]],<ref name=CAP/><ref name=Luo04/><ref name=\"KitchenerDugmore2000\" /> it would appear that the modern lion and tiger were present in Eurasia since the [[Pleistocene]], when now-extinct relatives also existed there.<ref name=Geptner/><ref name=Haas2005/><ref name=Mazak1981/> Additionally, in the days before [[Independence Day (India)|Indian Independence]], the [[Maharaja of Gwalior]] introduced African lions into [[Gwalior|his area]], which is a habitat for Bengal tigers.<ref name=\"Jhaletal2011\" />\n\n[[File:Asiatic Lion Gir Forest.jpg|left|thumb|An Asiatic lion in [[Gir Forest]], [[Kathiawar-Gir dry deciduous forests]]' [[ecoregion]], India]]\n[[File:Ranthambore Tiger Reserve (3619932614).jpg|right|thumb|T-12 the Bengal tiger in [[Ranthambore National Park]], Kathiawar-Gir dry deciduous forests' ecoregion, India]]\nThe possibility of conflict between lions and tigers had been raised in relation to India's [[Asiatic Lion Reintroduction Project]], which was meant to introduce the Gir Forest's lions to another reserve which is considered to be within the former range of the Asiatic lion, that is [[Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary]] in Madhya Pradesh,<ref name=\"cambridge\"/> before December 2017.<ref name=\"HT 2017\" /><ref name=\"TOI 12-2017\" /> Kuno was reported to contain some tigers that came from Ranthambore Park, including one called 'T-38'.<ref name=minn/><ref name=\"Thetimesofindia2013\"/> Concerns were raised that the co-presence of lions and tigers would \"trigger frequent clashes.\"<ref name=\"Thetimesofindia2006\" /> The [[University of Minnesota]]'s Lion Research Project describes one reason to delay the introduction of lions to Kuno Palpur, is the fear that tigers living there would kill the incoming lions. In a one-on-one encounter, it is believed that a Bengal tiger could beat an Indian lion, given its weight advantage.<ref name=minn/> Despite the fact that the habitats of Indian lions and tigers are similar means that they both live in conditions that favor solitary hunters of prey,<ref name=Kailash1978/> these lions are social like their African relatives,<ref name=S&S02 /> and may form fighting groups, whereas tigers are usually solitary. The American biologist [[Craig Packer]] considers that a group of lions (two to three males) or lionesses (two to four females) is more than a match for a single tiger or tigress. Craig Packer is of the opinion that, in order for Asiatic lions to survive in an area with Bengal tigers, the lions would have to be translocated there as intact groups rather than as individuals.<ref name=minn/>\n\n[[Reginald Innes Pocock]] (1939) mentioned that some people had the opinion that the tiger played a role in the near-extinction of the Indian lion, but he dismissed this view as 'fanciful'. According to him, there was evidence that tigers inhabited the Indian Subcontinent before lions. The tigers likely entered [[Northern India]] from the eastern end of the [[Himalayas]], through [[Burma]], and started spreading throughout the area, before the lions likely entered Northern India from [[Balochistan]] or [[Persia]], and spread to places like the Bengal and the [[Nerbudda River]]. Because of that, before the presence of man could limit the spread of lions, tigers reached parts of India that lions did not reach. However, the presence of tigers throughout India did not stop the spread of lions there, in the first place, so Pocock said that it is unlikely that Bengal tigers played a role, significant or subordinate, in the near-extinction of the Indian lion, rather, that man was responsible for it,<ref name=Pocock1939/> as was the case with the decline in tigers' numbers.<ref name=Geptner/><ref name=CAP/><ref name=Mazak1981/><ref name=Pocock1939/><ref name=Karanth03/> As such, Pocock thought that it was unlikely that serious competition between them regularly occurred, and that even if Indian lions and tigers met, the chance that they would fight for survival was as good as the chance that they would choose to avoid each other, and that their chances of success, if they were to clash, were as good as each other's.<ref name=Pocock1939/>\n\n== Observed fights ==\n[[File:Indischer Maler um 1650 (II) 001.jpg|thumb|A [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] painting of a [[Dervish]] with a lion and tiger]]\n\nIn the [[circus (building)|circuses]] of [[Ancient Rome]], exotic beasts were commonly pitted against each other,<ref name=\"Auguet1994\"/> including [[Barbary lion]]s<ref name=CAP/><ref name=Beinglion2005-2014 /><ref name=Petermaas2000-2011 /> and tigers.<ref name=Hoage8-18 /> A [[mosaic]] in the [[House of the Faun]] in [[Pompeii]] shows a fight between a lion and a tiger.<ref name=\"King2002\" /> There are different accounts of which of these [[animal]]s gained the victory.

Pursuing it, they caught a glimpse of it, but by that time, the tiger had attacked a local. It disappeared with the victim, and after pursuing it for about {{convert|50.0|yard|ft|abbr=on}}, they heard the roar of a lion, and besides it, sounds which suggested that it was in a struggle with the tiger, such as growls. The party not only managed to see the lion and tiger rolling about in their battle, after going through bushes, but also the man who fell victim to the tiger. The author termed both the lion and tiger as \"tyrants of the [[forest]],\" given that they would attack weaker creatures. The tiger was about the same size as the lion, but more agile. As for the lion, it used greater strength, and its mane, which was somewhat deeper than those of its bigger African cousins, could protect its head from the tiger's claws, though not other parts of its body, such as the back. They were as determined and brave as each other, but the lion endured. It caught the tiger's [[throat]], turned it on its back, and killed it by clawing its abdomen open. The lion was thus hailed as the \"King of Beasts.\" Otherwise, the fight had been harsh for both beasts, to the extent that the author felt that it would avenge their victims.<ref name=\"CUL1855\" />\n* ''[[The Sun (New York)]]'' reported that in a [[Population decline|depopulated]] Indian village at the bank of a [[Creek (stream)|creek]] connected to the [[Cauvery River]], about {{convert|30.0|mile|km|abbr=on}} [[Bayalu Seeme|north-west]] of [[Bangalore]], a hunter injured by a [[venom]]ous creature saw a tiger on his left-hand side, and a lion on his right-hand side. The tiger was a \"rousing big fellow, who had seen 15 years of his life,\" and had muscular limbs. The male lion was \"medium-sized.\" Both of them stalked him, but they did not notice each other at first, as they were separated by a wall that was about {{convert|4.0|ft|cm|abbr=on}} tall, and their focus was on the witness. When they got closer to him, the tiger scented the lion, and behaved like an angry [[cat]], which included making a noise that startled the latter. The lion showed its teeth in response, and after reaching the end of the wall, roared at its foe. After the lion's head showed around the wall, the crouching tiger pounced on it, and rolled over with it. Tigers often kill victims by biting their throats, and keeping their hold on them for as long as necessary,<ref name=Schaller1967 /> but that was not the case with this struggle. Despite different descriptions of their sizes by the narrator, and that the tiger was more agile than the lion, the tiger's neck was vulnerable to a bite by the lion, and for reasons like these, it was difficult for either cat to defeat the other, overall. After they temporarily retreated from each other, the hunter could see that they were both injured. Still, they were determined to destroy each other. The lion and tiger respectively roared and snarled. The narrator suspected that their hatred for each other may have been because both had been hunting him at the same time, therefore, their respective presences interfered with each other's hunt for him. The tiger pounced on the lion's back, rolling over or falling with it again, and struggling to its feet like it. The lion seemed helpless as the tiger held onto its fore shoulder, before making a move in which it managed to catch the tiger's neck. Now the tiger seemed helpless, before making a move to use its hind claws to force the lion to release its hold on it. Though the tiger was the aggressor this time, their struggle became more like [[Dog fighting|that of dogs]] unable to beat each other. They bled from nose to tail as they moved away from the witness, towards the creek. They fell into the water, which was about {{convert|2.0|ft|cm|abbr=on}} deep, and this stopped the fight.

If a tiger and a lion had a fight, which one would win? Well, I've seen tigers crunch up a full-grown [[leopard tortoise]] like it was nothing. And lions try, but they just don't get it right. If there's a fight, the tiger will win, every time.\"<ref name=\"Country Life\" />\n* The animal rescue organisation [[Big Cat Rescue]] of [[Tampa, Florida]] answered, \"While it would depend on the size, age, and aggressiveness of the specific animals involved, generally tigers have a significant advantage.\"<ref name=\"Big Cat Rescue\" />\n* The conservation charity [[Save China's Tigers]] stated \"Recent research indicates that the tiger is indeed stronger than the lion in terms of physical strength. Lions hunt in prides, so it would be in a group and the tiger as a solitary creature so it would be on its own. A tiger is generally physically larger than a lion. Most experts would favor a Siberian and [[Bengal tiger]] over an [[African lion]].\"<ref name=\"Save China's Tigers\" />\n* [[John Smith Clarke]], a [[United Kingdom|British]] lion tamer, said, in a lecture on the fight between a tiger and a lion given to the Glasgow Zoological Society, while showing the actual fight on the screen, \"in 100 cases out of 100, the tiger would always beat the lion. It was far more agile, it was not so clumsy in its movements, it was equally strong, it was equally armed, but it fought in a different way. The tiger very often fought rolling on its back and held the lion in its grip until it defeated him.\"<ref name=GlasgowHerald1937 />\n* Craig Saffoe, a [[biologist]] and the curator of great cats at the [[National Zoological Park (United States)|National Zoological Park]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], said that the outcome of a given fight totally depended on the individuals, with their fighting style, physiology and history, but that he would bet on the tiger winning. He also reckoned that the big cats ranked, from higher to lower, with tigers, jaguars and lions on top, and then [[cougar]]s, [[snow leopard]]s, leopards, and [[cheetahs]]. At the same time, he said that the most interesting \"match-up would be a good size Bengal tiger and a good-size male jaguar,\" because they had roughly the same speed, temperament, strength and size and strength, in his opinion.<ref name=\"HuffPost Saffoe 14-2012\">{{cite news |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/lion-tiger-cat-win-interspecies-fight_n_1676801 |title=Lion vs. Tiger: Which Cat Would Win Interspecies Fight? |newspaper=The [[HuffPost]] |date=7 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Favoring the lion ===\n* Clyde Beatty, the animal trainer and performer who owned several tigers, lions, hyenas, and other exotic animals, believed that in nine out of 10 times, \"a full-grown lion would whip a full-grown tiger\".<ref name=\"Popular Mechanics\"/>\n* Dave Hoover, the animal trainer for Clyde Beatty-Cole Brothers Circus, mentions that he lost many tigers to male lions: \"I have to keep the male lions from killing each other.

The continuity of glaciers, inferred from oriented [[glacial striation]]s and deposits called [[tillite]]s, suggested the existence of the supercontinent of [[Gondwana]], which became a central element of the concept of continental drift. Striations indicated glacial flow away from the equator and toward the poles, based on continents' current positions and orientations, and supported the idea that the southern continents had previously been in dramatically different locations that were contiguous with one another.<ref name=wegb />\n\n== See also ==\n* {{annotated link|Geological history of Earth}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|27em}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite book |last=Frankel |first=Henry R.|date=2012 |title=The Continental Drift Controversy |volume=Volume I: ''Wegener and the Early Debate'' |publisher=Cambridge |ref=Frankel }}\n*{{Citation\n |first= Homer Eugene\n |last= Le Grand\n |year= 1988\n |title= Drifting Continents and Shifting Theories\n |publisher= Cambridge University\n |isbn= 978-0-521-31105-2\n |ref= none\n |url-access= registration\n |url= https://archive.org/details/driftingcontinen00legr\n }}.\n*{{Citation\n |first= Naomi |last= Oreskes\n |year= 1999\n |title= The Rejection of Continental Drift\n |publisher= Oxford University Press\n |isbn=  978-0-19-511732-5\n |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=EEQdk9GRfkoC&pg=PA14\n |ref= none\n}} (pb: {{ISBNT | 0-19-511733-6 }}).\n*{{Citation\n |first1        = Naomi\n |last1         = Oreskes\n |chapter       = Continental Drift\n |editor1-first = Ted\n |editor1-last  = Munn\n |editor2-first = Michael C.\n |editor2-last  = MacCracken\n |editor3-first = John S.\n |editor3-last  = Perry\n |date          = 2002\n |title         = Encyclopedia of Global Environmental Change\n |volume        = Vol. 1\n |pages         = 321\u2013325\n |publisher     = John Wiley & Sons\n |place         = Chichester, West Sussex\n |isbn          = 978-0-471-97796-4\n |oclc          = 633880622\n |chapter-url   = http://historyweb.ucsd.edu/oreskes/Papers/Continentaldrift2002.pdf\n |url-status       = dead\n |archiveurl    = https://web.archive.org/web/20120204234030/http://historyweb.ucsd.edu/oreskes/Papers/Continentaldrift2002.pdf\n |archivedate   = 4 February 2012\n |df            = dmy-all\n}} <!-- CAUTION: catalogs are inconsistent.
