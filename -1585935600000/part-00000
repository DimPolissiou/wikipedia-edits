On June 20, 1863, at the height of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Wetzel was one of fifty Virginia counties admitted to the Union as the state of West Virginia.\n\nLater that year, West Virginia's counties were divided into [[civil township]]s, with the intention of encouraging local government.  This proved impractical in the heavily rural state, and in 1872 the townships were converted into [[minor civil division|magisterial districts]].<ref>Otis K. Rice & Stephen W. Brown, ''West Virginia: A History'', 2nd ed., University Press of Kentucky, Lexington (1993), p. 240.</ref>  Wetzel County was divided into six districts: Center,{{efn-lr|Initially spelled \"Centre\".}} Church, Grant, Green, Magnolia, and Proctor.  A seventh district, Clay, was formed in the 1880s.  New Martinsville, the [[county seat]], was in Magnolia District.  Except for minor adjustments, the seven historic magisterial districts remained largely unchanged for a century, until the 1980s, when they were consolidated into three new districts: District 1, District 2, and District 3.<ref>[[United States Census Bureau]], [[United States Census|U.S. Decennial Census]], Tables of Minor Civil Divisions in West Virginia, 1870\u20132010.</ref>\n\n{{expand section|date=December 2013}}\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|361|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|358|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|3.3|sqmi}} (0.9%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=http://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/maps-data/data/gazetteer/counties_list_54.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=July 31, 2015|date=August 22, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files}}</ref>\n\n===Major highways===\n* {{jct|state=WV|US|250}}\n* {{jct|state=WV|WV|2}}\n* {{jct|state=WV|WV|7}}\n* {{jct|state=WV|WV|20}}\n* {{jct|state=WV|WV|69}}\n* {{jct|state=WV|WV|180}}\n\n===Adjacent counties===\n* [[Marshall County, West Virginia|Marshall County]] (north)\n* [[Greene County, Pennsylvania]] (northeast)\n* [[Monongalia County, West Virginia|Monongalia County]] (east)\n* [[Marion County, West Virginia|Marion County]] (east)\n* [[Harrison County, West Virginia|Harrison County]] (southeast)\n* [[Doddridge County, West Virginia|Doddridge County]] (south)\n* [[Tyler County, West Virginia|Tyler County]] (southwest)\n* [[Monroe County, Ohio]] (west)\n\n===National protected area===\n* [[Ohio River Islands National Wildlife Refuge]] (part)\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1850= 4284\n|1860= 6703\n|1870= 8595\n|1880= 13896\n|1890= 16841\n|1900= 22880\n|1910= 23855\n|1920= 23069\n|1930= 22334\n|1940= 22342\n|1950= 20154\n|1960= 19347\n|1970= 20314\n|1980= 21874\n|1990= 19258\n|2000= 17693\n|2010= 16583\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=15270\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=May 29, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=U.S. Decennial Census|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=January 16, 2014}}</ref><br />1790\u20131960<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu|title=Historical Census Browser|publisher=University of Virginia Library|accessdate=January 16, 2014}}</ref> 1900\u20131990<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/cencounts/wv190090.txt|title=Population of Counties by Decennial Census: 1900 to 1990|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=January 16, 2014}}</ref><br />1990\u20132000<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/cen2000/briefs/phc-t4/tables/tab02.pdf|title=Census 2000 PHC-T-4.

A number of robberies and murders were accounted to this gang. They were known to be located near the head of Doolin Run near Tarpan Ridge. The home they occupied was found to have an escape tunnel that had been used to escape capture on several occasions. A local group of citizens known as the \"Redmen\" ultimately cornered the gang at this home and a number of the members were killed. A detailed description exists in the Wetzel County History written approximately in 1900.\n\nThe oldest oil well location known is of one drilled on Long Run near Doolin Run which reached oil at a depth about 360&nbsp;ft.\n\nWetzel County has a long history in the Oil and Gas producing industry. During the Oil boom of the 19th century it is reported that the Proctor Creek watershed had 12 saloons and numerous livery/hotels to accommodate the hundreds of logging and oil field workers.\n\n==Communities==\n\n===Cities===\n* [[New Martinsville, West Virginia|New Martinsville]] (county seat)\n* [[Paden City, West Virginia|Paden City]] (part)\n\n===Towns===\n* [[Hundred, West Virginia|Hundred]]\n* [[Pine Grove, Wetzel County, West Virginia|Pine Grove]]\n* [[Smithfield, West Virginia|Smithfield]]\n\n===Magisterial districts===\n====Current====\n* District 1\n* District 2\n* District 3\n\n====Historic====\n* Center\n* Church\n* Clay\n* Grant\n* Green\n* Magnolia\n* Proctor\n\n===Census-designated places===\n* [[Jacksonburg, West Virginia|Jacksonburg]]\n* [[Littleton, West Virginia|Littleton]]\n* [[Reader, West Virginia|Reader]]\n\n===Unincorporated communities===\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Bebee, West Virginia|Bebee]]\n* [[Big Run, Wetzel County, West Virginia|Big Run]]\n* [[Burton, West Virginia|Burton]]\n* [[Coburn, West Virginia|Coburn]]\n* [[Earnshaw, West Virginia|Earnshaw]]\n* [[Folsom, West Virginia|Folsom]]\n* [[Hastings, West Virginia|Hastings]]\n* [[Knob Fork, West Virginia|Knob Fork]]\n* [[Maud, West Virginia|Maud]]\n* [[Porters Falls, West Virginia|Porters Falls]]\n* [[Proctor, West Virginia|Proctor]]\n* [[Rockport, Wetzel County, West Virginia|Rockport]]\n* [[Silver Hill, Wetzel County, West Virginia|Silver Hill]]\n* [[Wheat, West Virginia|Wheat]]\n* [[Wileyville, West Virginia|Wileyville]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cecil H.

On June 20, 1863, at the height of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Wetzel was one of fifty Virginia counties admitted to the Union as the state of West Virginia.\n\nLater that year, West Virginia's counties were divided into [[civil township]]s, with the intention of encouraging local government.  This proved impractical in the heavily rural state, and in 1872 the townships were converted into [[minor civil division|magisterial districts]].<ref>Otis K. Rice & Stephen W. Brown, ''West Virginia: A History'', 2nd ed., University Press of Kentucky, Lexington (1993), p. 240.</ref>  Wetzel County was divided into six districts: Center,{{efn-lr|Initially spelled \"Centre\".}} Church, Grant, Green, Magnolia, and Proctor.  A seventh district, Clay, was formed in the 1880s.  New Martinsville, the [[county seat]], was in Magnolia District.  Except for minor adjustments, the seven historic magisterial districts remained largely unchanged for a century, until the 1980s, when they were consolidated into three new districts: District 1, District 2, and District 3.<ref>[[United States Census Bureau]], [[United States Census|U.S. Decennial Census]], Tables of Minor Civil Divisions in West Virginia, 1870\u20132010.</ref>\n\n{{expand section|date=December 2013}}\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|361|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|358|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|3.3|sqmi}} (0.9%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=http://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/maps-data/data/gazetteer/counties_list_54.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=July 31, 2015|date=August 22, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files}}</ref>\n\n===Major highways===\n*{{jct|state=WV|US|250}}\n*{{jct|state=WV|WV|2}}\n*{{jct|state=WV|WV|7}}\n*{{jct|state=WV|WV|20}}\n*{{jct|state=WV|WV|69}}\n*{{jct|state=WV|WV|180}}\n\n===Adjacent counties===\n*[[Marshall County, West Virginia|Marshall County]] (north)\n*[[Greene County, Pennsylvania]] (northeast)\n*[[Monongalia County, West Virginia|Monongalia County]] (east)\n*[[Marion County, West Virginia|Marion County]] (east)\n*[[Harrison County, West Virginia|Harrison County]] (southeast)\n*[[Doddridge County, West Virginia|Doddridge County]] (south)\n*[[Tyler County, West Virginia|Tyler County]] (southwest)\n*[[Monroe County, Ohio]] (west)\n\n===National protected area===\n*[[Ohio River Islands National Wildlife Refuge]] (part)\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1850= 4284\n|1860= 6703\n|1870= 8595\n|1880= 13896\n|1890= 16841\n|1900= 22880\n|1910= 23855\n|1920= 23069\n|1930= 22334\n|1940= 22342\n|1950= 20154\n|1960= 19347\n|1970= 20314\n|1980= 21874\n|1990= 19258\n|2000= 17693\n|2010= 16583\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=15270\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=May 29, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=U.S. Decennial Census|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=January 16, 2014}}</ref><br />1790\u20131960<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu|title=Historical Census Browser|publisher=University of Virginia Library|accessdate=January 16, 2014}}</ref> 1900\u20131990<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/cencounts/wv190090.txt|title=Population of Counties by Decennial Census: 1900 to 1990|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=January 16, 2014}}</ref><br />1990\u20132000<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/cen2000/briefs/phc-t4/tables/tab02.pdf|title=Census 2000 PHC-T-4.

A number of robberies and murders were accounted to this gang. They were known to be located near the head of Doolin Run near Tarpan Ridge. The home they occupied was found to have an escape tunnel that had been used to escape capture on several occasions. A local group of citizens known as the \"Redmen\" ultimately cornered the gang at this home and a number of the members were killed. A detailed description exists in the Wetzel County History written approximately in 1900.\n\nThe oldest oil well location known is of one drilled on Long Run near Doolin Run which reached oil at a depth about 360&nbsp;ft.\n\nWetzel County has a long history in the Oil and Gas producing industry. During the Oil boom of the 19th century it is reported that the Proctor Creek watershed had 12 saloons and numerous livery/hotels to accommodate the hundreds of logging and oil field workers.\n\n==Communities==\n\n===Cities===\n*[[New Martinsville, West Virginia|New Martinsville]] (county seat)\n*[[Paden City, West Virginia|Paden City]] (part)\n\n===Towns===\n*[[Hundred, West Virginia|Hundred]]\n*[[Pine Grove, Wetzel County, West Virginia|Pine Grove]]\n*[[Smithfield, West Virginia|Smithfield]]\n\n===Magisterial districts===\n====Current====\n*District 1\n*District 2\n*District 3\n\n====Historic====\n*Center\n*Church\n*Clay\n*Grant\n*Green\n*Magnolia\n*Proctor\n\n===Census-designated places===\n*[[Jacksonburg, West Virginia|Jacksonburg]]\n*[[Littleton, West Virginia|Littleton]]\n*[[Reader, West Virginia|Reader]]\n\n===Unincorporated communities===\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Bebee, West Virginia|Bebee]]\n*[[Big Run, Wetzel County, West Virginia|Big Run]]\n*[[Burton, West Virginia|Burton]]\n*[[Coburn, West Virginia|Coburn]]\n*[[Earnshaw, West Virginia|Earnshaw]]\n*[[Folsom, West Virginia|Folsom]]\n*[[Hastings, West Virginia|Hastings]]\n*[[Knob Fork, West Virginia|Knob Fork]]\n*[[Maud, West Virginia|Maud]]\n*[[Porters Falls, West Virginia|Porters Falls]]\n*[[Proctor, West Virginia|Proctor]]\n*[[Rockport, Wetzel County, West Virginia|Rockport]]\n*[[Silver Hill, Wetzel County, West Virginia|Silver Hill]]\n*[[Wheat, West Virginia|Wheat]]\n*[[Wileyville, West Virginia|Wileyville]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cecil H.

It is a remake of his own [[Telugu language|Telugu]] film ''[[Arjun Reddy]]'' (2017). Jointly produced by Cine1 Studios and [[T-Series (company)|T-Series]], the film stars [[Shahid Kapoor]] and [[Kiara Advani]]. Kapoor plays Kabir Singh, a surgeon who spirals into self-destruction when his girlfriend, Preeti leaves him.\n\n[[Principal photography]] began in October 2018 and ended in March 2019. The film was theatrically released in India on 21 June 2019 and received mixed reviews, with criticism directed at it for glamorising [[misogyny]] and [[toxic masculinity]], though Kapoor's performance was praised. It grossed over {{INR}}379 crore, becoming the second [[List of Bollywood films of 2019#Box office collection|highest grossing Bollywood]] film of 2019.<ref name=\"bwww\" />\n\n== Plot ==\nKabir Rajdheer Singh is a house surgeon at Delhi Institute of Medical Sciences. Despite being a brilliant student, he has severe [[anger management]] problems that earn the wrath of the college dean. Kabir's aggressive nature also earns him a reputation among his juniors as a [[Workplace bullying in academia|college bully]]. After having a brawl with Amit, one of the team members from another college alongside his friend Kamal against other members of the opposing team who ridiculed them during an inter-college [[Association football|football]] match, the dean asks Kabir to either apologise or leave the college. Kabir initially chooses to leave but stays back after meeting and falling in love with first-year student Preeti Sikka.\n\nKabir and his friend Shiva enter a third-year classroom and announce that Kabir is in love with Preeti, asserting that she is exclusive to him. Initially afraid, Preeti starts adjusting herself to Kabir's overbearing attitude. She eventually reciprocates his feelings, and they develop an intimate relationship. Kabir graduates with an [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery|MBBS]] degree and leaves for [[Mussoorie]] to pursue a postgraduate degree in [[Orthopedic surgery]]. Over the course of three years, Kabir and Preeti's relationship becomes stronger. Months later, Kabir visits Preeti's house, where her father, Harpal, sees them kissing and throws Kabir out.\n\nHarpal opposes Preeti and Kabir's relationship since he dislikes Kabir's personality. Kabir demands that Preeti must decide within six hours; otherwise, he will end their relationship. By the time she manages to visit Kabir's house, he is drunk, injects [[morphine]] into himself, and becomes unconscious for two days, missing his elder brother Karan's wedding in the process. Preeti is then forcibly married to another man named Jatinder from her caste. Kabir learns about the marriage from Shiva and goes to her house in protest. He is assaulted and gets arrested for making a scene. Kabir's father, Rajdheer, ostracises him from the family home for damaging his reputation.\n\nWith Shiva's help, Kabir finds a rented apartment and joins a private hospital as a surgeon. To cope with his emotions, he starts taking drugs, attempts [[One-night stand|one-night stands]], buys a pet dog and names it after Preeti, and drinks alcohol; all of which are unsuccessful. Within months, he becomes a successful surgeon and a [[high-functioning alcoholic]] feared by the hospital's staff members, one reason being his high surgery count. Kabir's self-destructive behaviour and refusal to move on worries Shiva and Kamal. He persuades one of his patients, Jia Sharma, a leading film star, to have a no-strings relationship with him, which he ends when she falls in love with him. Karan arrives at Kabir's flat and unsuccessfully persuades him to return home.\n\nOn a day off, Kabir unwillingly agrees to perform a life-saving surgical operation. During the surgery, he collapses with [[dehydration]]. The hospital staff examine his blood samples, which show traces of alcohol and [[cocaine]]. The hospital chief files a case against Kabir, who accepts the truth on the grounds of violating his professional ethics during an in-house court hearing, despite Shiva and Karan making arrangements to bail him out. Kabir's medical licence is cancelled for five years, and he is evicted from the flat. The next morning, Shiva manages to reach Kabir to convey his grandmother Sadhna Kaur's death; he meets with his father, and they reconcile. Kabir quits his self-destructive habits soon after.\n\nWhile leaving for a vacation, Kabir meets a pregnant Preeti sitting in a park. She initially refuses to listen or talk to Kabir, but Shiva tells her why Kabir could not accept her earlier. Convinced, Preeti reveals that she left Jatinder three days after their marriage and continued to work in a clinic. She tells Kabir that he is the child's father, and they reunite. The pair marries, and Harpal apologises for misunderstanding their love for each other. The film ends off with the couple on the beach with their baby, after having their wedding photos taken along with Kabir's family.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Shahid Kapoor and Kiara Advani.jpg|thumb|upright=1|alt=Shahid Kapoor and Kiara Advani are posing for the camera|[[Shahid Kapoor]] and [[Kiara Advani]] at a promotional event for the film]]\n{{cast listing|\n*[[Shahid Kapoor]] as Dr Kabir Rajdheer Singh\n* [[Kiara Advani]] as Dr Preeti Kabir Singh / Preeti Sikka<ref name=\":0\" />\n* Soham Majumdar as Dr Shiva<ref name=\"bollywoodhungama\" />\n* [[Arjan Bajwa]] as Karan Rajdheer Singh\n* [[Nikita Dutta]] as Jia Sharma<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-nikita-dutta-her-experience-working-shahid-kapoor-kabir-singh-portraying-jia-sharma-456650 |title=Exclusive: Nikita Dutta on her experience of working with Shahid Kapoor in Kabir Singh & portraying Jia Sharma |last=Darade |first=Pooja |date=19 June 2019 |website=Pinkvilla |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20190619084220/https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-nikita-dutta-her-experience-working-shahid-kapoor-kabir-singh-portraying-jia-sharma-456650 |archive-date=19 June 2019 |access-date=19 June 2019}}</ref>\n* [[Kamini Kaushal]] as Sadhna Kaur \"Dadi\"<ref name=\"bollywoodhungama\" />\n* [[Suresh Oberoi]] as Rajdheer Singh\n* [[Adil Hussain]] as Vijay K.

[[Santhana Krishnan Ravichandran]] was selected as the cinematographer, and Aarif Sheikh as editor.<ref name=\"bollywoodhungama\" /> Vanga was confident that the remake would be even more hard hitting than the original: \"When I made ''Arjun Reddy'', I wasn't sure where to draw the line in terms of representation of certain things. I don't think I'd have to restrict myself when it comes to the Hindi version. I believe I'll have more freedom in Bollywood.\"<ref name=\"ShahidConfirmed\" /> The film's title ''Kabir Singh'' was announced on 25 October 2018.<ref name=\"TitleRevealed\" />\n\n=== Writing ===\nLike the Telugu original, ''Kabir Singh'' too begins with a voiceover from the hero's paternal grandmother, but this time she is reciting a Kabir Doha. There are also geographical changes; the remake is set primarily in Delhi and Mumbai. Instead of caste conflict as in ''Arjun Reddy'', the heroine's father takes offence to Kabir's smoking and not being a [[turban]]-wearing [[Sikhs|Sikh]]. For the remake, Vanga said he deployed less English than the original. \"I've also tried to retain the colloquial quality in the Hindi dialogue.\" About the name Kabir Singh, he said, \"There's a lot of melancholy in the name Kabir and a poetic side too.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/leisure/story/20190617-crazy-in-love-1543900-2019-06-07 |title=Crazy in love |last=Singh |first=Suhani |date=7 June 2019 |website=[[India Today]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190607162330/https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/leisure/story/20190617-crazy-in-love-1543900-2019-06-07 |archive-date=7 June 2019 |access-date=7 June 2019}}</ref> Vanga explained his reasons for choosing this as the film's title: \"When we started work on the Hindi script, it was a very exciting journey.

It is a remake of his own [[Telugu language|Telugu]] film ''[[Arjun Reddy]]'' (2017). Jointly produced by Cine1 Studios and [[T-Series (company)|T-Series]], the film stars [[Shahid Kapoor]] and [[Kiara Advani]]. Kapoor plays Kabir Singh, a surgeon who spirals into self-destruction when his girlfriend, Preeti leaves him.\n\n[[Principal photography]] began in October 2018 and ended in March 2019. The film was theatrically released in India on 21 June 2019 and received mixed reviews, with criticism directed at it for glamorising [[misogyny]] and [[toxic masculinity]], though Kapoor's performance was praised. It grossed over {{INR}}379 crore, becoming the second [[List of Bollywood films of 2019#Box office collection|highest grossing Bollywood]] film of 2019.<ref name=\"bwww\" />\n\n== Plot ==\nKabir Rajdheer Singh is a house surgeon at Delhi Institute of Medical Sciences. Despite being a brilliant student, he has severe [[anger management]] problems that earn the wrath of the college dean. Kabir's aggressive nature also earns him a reputation among his juniors as a [[Workplace bullying in academia|college bully]]. After having a brawl with Amit, one of the team members from another college alongside his friend Kamal against other members of the opposing team who ridiculed them during an inter-college [[Association football|football]] match, the dean asks Kabir to either apologise or leave the college. Kabir initially chooses to leave but stays back after meeting and falling in love with first-year student Preeti Sikka.\n\nKabir and his friend Shiva enter a third-year classroom and announce that Kabir is in love with Preeti, asserting that she is exclusive to him. Initially afraid, Preeti starts adjusting herself to Kabir's overbearing attitude. She eventually reciprocates his feelings, and they develop an intimate relationship. Kabir graduates with an [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery|MBBS]] degree and leaves for [[Mussoorie]] to pursue a postgraduate degree in [[Orthopedic surgery]]. Over the course of three years, Kabir and Preeti's relationship becomes stronger. Months later, Kabir visits Preeti's house, where her father, Harpal, sees them kissing and throws Kabir out.\n\nHarpal opposes Preeti and Kabir's relationship since he dislikes Kabir's personality. Kabir demands that Preeti must decide within six hours; otherwise, he will end their relationship. By the time she manages to visit Kabir's house, he is drunk, injects [[morphine]] into himself, and becomes unconscious for two days, missing his elder brother Karan's wedding in the process. Preeti is then forcibly married to another man named Jatinder from her caste. Kabir learns about the marriage from Shiva and goes to her house in protest. He is assaulted and gets arrested for making a scene. Kabir's father, Rajdheer, ostracises him from the family home for damaging his reputation.\n\nWith Shiva's help, Kabir finds a rented apartment and joins a private hospital as a surgeon. To cope with his emotions, he starts taking drugs, attempts [[One-night stand|one-night stands]], buys a pet dog and names it after Preeti, and drinks alcohol; all of which are unsuccessful. Within months, he becomes a successful surgeon and a [[high-functioning alcoholic]] feared by the hospital's staff members, one reason being his high surgery count. Kabir's self-destructive behaviour and refusal to move on worries Shiva and Kamal. He persuades one of his patients, Jia Sharma, a leading film star, to have a no-strings relationship with him, which he ends when she falls in love with him. Karan arrives at Kabir's flat and unsuccessfully persuades him to return home.\n\nOn a day off, Kabir unwillingly agrees to perform a life-saving surgical operation. During the surgery, he collapses with [[dehydration]]. The hospital staff examine his blood samples, which show traces of alcohol and [[cocaine]]. The hospital chief files a case against Kabir, who accepts the truth on the grounds of violating his professional ethics during an in-house court hearing, despite Shiva and Karan making arrangements to bail him out. Kabir's medical licence is cancelled for five years, and he is evicted from the flat. The next morning, Shiva manages to reach Kabir to convey his grandmother Sadhna Kaur's death; he meets with his father, and they reconcile. Kabir quits his self-destructive habits soon after.\n\nWhile leaving for a vacation, Kabir meets a pregnant Preeti sitting in a park. She initially refuses to listen or talk to Kabir, but Shiva tells her why Kabir could not accept her earlier. Convinced, Preeti reveals that she left Jatinder three days after their marriage and continued to work in a clinic. She tells Kabir that he is the child's father, and they reunite. The pair marries, and Harpal apologises for misunderstanding their love for each other. The film ends off with the couple on the beach with their baby, after having their wedding photos taken along with Kabir's family.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Shahid Kapoor and Kiara Advani.jpg|thumb|upright=1|alt=Shahid Kapoor and Kiara Advani are posing for the camera|[[Shahid Kapoor]] and [[Kiara Advani]] at a promotional event for the film]]\n{{cast listing|\n*[[Shahid Kapoor]] as Dr Kabir Rajdheer Singh\n* [[Kiara Advani]] as Dr Preeti Kabir Singh / Preeti Sikka<ref name=\":0\" />\n* Soham Majumdar as Dr Shiva<ref name=\"bollywoodhungama\" />\n* [[Arjan Bajwa]] as Karan Rajdheer Singh\n* [[Nikita Dutta]] as Jia Sharma<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-nikita-dutta-her-experience-working-shahid-kapoor-kabir-singh-portraying-jia-sharma-456650 |title=Exclusive: Nikita Dutta on her experience of working with Shahid Kapoor in Kabir Singh & portraying Jia Sharma |last=Darade |first=Pooja |date=19 June 2019 |website=Pinkvilla |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20190619084220/https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-nikita-dutta-her-experience-working-shahid-kapoor-kabir-singh-portraying-jia-sharma-456650 |archive-date=19 June 2019 |access-date=19 June 2019}}</ref>\n* [[Kamini Kaushal]] as Sadhna Kaur \"Dadi\"<ref name=\"bollywoodhungama\" />\n* [[Suresh Oberoi]] as Rajdheer Singh\n* [[Adil Hussain]] as Vijay K.

When it did not work out, he approached [[Shahid Kapoor]]. However, producers Murad Khetani and Ashwin Varde of Cine1 Studios, who acquired the remake rights for Hindi, wanted [[Arjun Kapoor]] to play the male lead. Disappointed, Vanga said, \"I've come to know that the remake rights of ''Arjun Reddy'' have been sold and it would star Arjun Kapoor. I am caught in a dilemma, as I've already locked Shahid for the role. It's a very embarrassing situation for me. I don't know how I'll face Shahid.\"<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.deccanchronicle.com/entertainment/bollywood/250118/wont-redirect-arjun-reddy-with-arjun-kapoor.html |title=Wanted Ranveer, approached Shahid, unsure about directing Arjun: Arjun Reddy director |last=Jha |first=Subhash K. |date=25 January 2018 |work=[[Deccan Chronicle]] |access-date=30 October 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180513154033/https://deccanchronicle.com/entertainment/bollywood/250118/wont-redirect-arjun-reddy-with-arjun-kapoor.html |archive-date=13 May 2018 |author-link=Subhash K.

[[Santhana Krishnan Ravichandran]] was selected as the cinematographer, and Aarif Sheikh as editor.<ref name=\"bollywoodhungama\" /> Vanga was confident that the remake would be even more hard hitting than the original: \"When I made ''Arjun Reddy'', I wasn't sure where to draw the line in terms of representation of certain things. I don't think I'd have to restrict myself when it comes to the Hindi version. I believe I'll have more freedom in Bollywood.\"<ref name=\"ShahidConfirmed\" /> The film's title ''Kabir Singh'' was announced on 25 October 2018.<ref name=\"TitleRevealed\" />\n\n=== Writing ===\nLike the Telugu original, ''Kabir Singh'' too begins with a voiceover from the hero's paternal grandmother, but this time she is reciting a Kabir Doha. There are also geographical changes; the remake is set primarily in Delhi and Mumbai. Instead of caste conflict as in ''Arjun Reddy'', the heroine's father takes offence to Kabir's smoking and not being a [[turban]]-wearing [[Sikhs|Sikh]]. For the remake, Vanga said he deployed less English than the original. \"I've also tried to retain the colloquial quality in the Hindi dialogue.\" About the name Kabir Singh, he said, \"There's a lot of melancholy in the name Kabir and a poetic side too.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/leisure/story/20190617-crazy-in-love-1543900-2019-06-07 |title=Crazy in love |last=Singh |first=Suhani |date=7 June 2019 |website=[[India Today]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190607162330/https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/leisure/story/20190617-crazy-in-love-1543900-2019-06-07 |archive-date=7 June 2019 |access-date=7 June 2019}}</ref> Vanga explained his reasons for choosing this as the film's title: \"When we started work on the Hindi script, it was a very exciting journey.

Carollo, a frequent critic of the manager, also theorized that Gonzalez used his position to fast-track his permit through necessary approvals across multiple city departments.\n\nSuarez filed a veto on December 23, 2019. In his veto message, Suarez argued that it was improper for the commission, which raised the accusations, to empower a direct subordinate of the commission, the auditor, to launch an investigation. Suarez said the auditor cannot be truly independent because the commission controls the auditor's budget and staffing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article238671943.html|title=Miami Mayor Issues Veto to Investigation of Manager|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nCity attorney Victoria Mendez issued an opinion on December 24, 2019, saying Mayor Francis Suarez lacked the power to veto a recent commission vote.

Greenblatt-Janollari started producing shows in the 1998-1999 season with 3 comedy series for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and [[CBS]]. While funded by Fox, G-JS was presented as an \"independent mini-studio\".<ref name=cccmptvi/> With [[Fox Entertainment Group]] holding a 20% stake in New Regency Production's parent corporation, Fox Studios formed a joint venture, [[Regency Television]], by 2000, managed by [[Gail Berman]].<ref name=cccmptvi/><ref name=dl/> Another production unit formed was Fox Television Studios Productions (FTSP) under Lisa Berger. Early output by the individual units, or \"pods\" were FTSP's ''[[Son of the Beach]]'' for FX, ''[[The Hughleys]]'' by G-JS and Regency had ''[[Malcolm in the Middle]]''.<ref name=dl/>\n\nThe pod model faded into five divisions: alternative, scripted, international, Fox World and Regency TV. The alternative division was responsible for ''[[Talkshow with Spike Feresten]]'' and ''[[The Wanda Sykes Show]]'', along with [[E!]]'s ''[[The Girls Next Door]]'' franchise. The scripted division produced ''[[The Shield]]'', along with a number of television films and miniseries.<ref name=dl/>\n\nFox World division had acquired rights to \"The Coach\" in early 2002 from France\u2019s TF1 and its Quai Sud production entity. In mid-2002, Fox Alternative Productions was formed by Fox TV Studios and headed by David Martin with its first show to be \"The Coach\".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Schneider |first1=Michael |last2=Schneider |first2=Michael |title=Fox to stage real \u2018Coach\u2019 |url=https://variety.com/2002/tv/news/fox-to-stage-real-coach-1117870351/ |accessdate=July 12, 2019 |work=Variety |date=July 29, 2002 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nAfter a while, the only division operating was the scripted unit. Next FTVS attempted international co-productions of direct-to-series broadcast series. The company had a hit with ''[[Burn Notice]]'' on USA Network. In August 2010, Dave Madden was appointed to head the unit, where he evenly increased its production slates until he was appointed as president of entertainment for Fox Broadcasting in August 2014.<ref name=dl/>\n\n===Fox 21===\n'''Fox 21''' was formed in 2004 by [[20th Century Fox Television]] executives [[Dana Walden]] and Gary Newman to develop and back smaller-budgeted but unique and daring shows.
