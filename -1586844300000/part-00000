Prabhakar Vardhana was the first king of the Vardhana dynasty with his capital at [[Thanesar|Thaneswar]].\nAfter Prabhakar Vardhana's death in 605, his eldest son, Rajya Vardhana, ascended the throne.

The [[Kuomintang]] (KMT, Chinese Nationalist Party), its officers and approximately 2 million [[Republic of China Armed Forces|troops]] took part in the retreat; in addition to many civilians and refugees, fleeing from the advances of the [[Communist Party of China|Communist]] [[People's Liberation Army]].\n\nTroops mostly fled to Taiwan from provinces in southern China, including [[Sichuan|Sichuan Province]], where the [[last stand]] of the [[Republic of China Army|Republic of China's main army]] took place. The flight to Taiwan took place over four months after [[Mao Zedong]] had proclaimed the founding of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] in Beijing on {{Format date|1949|October|1}}.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite news |last=Han |first=Cheung |title=Taiwan in Time: The great retreat |url = http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2016/12/04/2003660529/1 |newspaper = Taipei Times }}</ref> \n\nAfter the retreat, the Republic of China leadership, led by ''Generalissimo'' and President [[Chiang Kai-shek]] planned to make the retreat only temporary, hoping to regroup, fortify and reconquer the mainland.<ref name=\":3\" />  This plan, which never came into fruition, was known as \"[[Project National Glory]]\", and made the national priority of the Republic of China on Taiwan.  Once it became apparent that such a plan could not be realized, Taiwan's national focus shifted to the [[modernization]] and [[economic development]] of Taiwan, even as the ROC continues to claim sovereignty over regions under PRC control.\n\n== Background ==\nThe Chinese Civil War between [[Chiang Kai-shek]]\u2019s KMT forces and Mao Zedong's [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP) entered its final stage in 1945, following the [[surrender of Japan]]. Both sides sought to control and unify China. While Chiang heavily relied on assistance from the United States, Mao relied on support from the Soviet Union as well as the rural population of China.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite web |last1=Zh\u00e0nzh\u0113ng |first1=Jief\u00e0ng |title=Civil War 1945-1949 |url = https://csuepress.columbusstate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1170&amp=&context=bibliography_faculty&amp=&sei-redir=1&referer=https%253A%252F%252Fscholar.google.com%252Fscholar%253Fhl%253Den%2526as_sdt%253D0%25252C5%2526q%253Dchinese%252Bcivil%252Bwar%2526btnG%253D#search=%22chinese%20civil%20war%22 }}</ref>\n\nThe bloody conflict between the KMT and the CCP began when both parties were attempting to subdue [[Warlord Era|Chinese warlords]] in northern China ({{Dash year|1926|1928|notrunc=on}}) and continued though the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese occupation]] ({{Dash year|1932|1945|notrunc=on}}). The need to eliminate the warlords was seen as necessary by both Mao Zedong and Chiang Kai-shek, but for different reasons. For Mao, their elimination would end the [[Feudalism in China|feudal system in China]], encouraging and preparing the country for [[Socialism (Marxism)|socialism]] and [[communism]]. For Chiang, the warlords were a great threat to the [[central government]]. This basic dissimilarity in motivation continued throughout the years of fighting against Japanese occupation in China, in spite of a common enemy.\n\nMao's Communist forces mobilized the peasantry in rural China against the Japanese, and at the time of the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender in 1945]] the Chinese Communist Party had built an army of nearly a million soldiers. The pressure Mao's forces placed on the Japanese benefitted the Soviet Union, and thus the CCP forces were supplied by the Soviets. The ideological unity of the CCP, and the experience acquired in fighting the Japanese, prepared it for the next battles against the Kuomintang. Though Chiang's forces were well equipped by the US, they lacked effective leadership, political unity and experience.  \n\nIn January 1949, Chiang Kai-shek stepped down as leader of the KMT and was replaced by his vice-president, [[Li Zongren]]. Li and Mao entered into negotiations for peace, but Nationalist hardliners rejected Mao's demands. \n\nThe Communist military capability was a deciding factor in resolving the impasse, and when Li sought an additional delay in mid-April 1949, the Chinese Red Army crossed the [[Yangtze]] (Chang) River. Chiang fled to the [[Geography of Taiwan|island of Formosa]] (Taiwan), where approximately 300,000 soldiers had already been [[Airlift|airlifted]]. \n\n== Relocation of forces and people ==\nOver the course of 4 months beginning in August 1948, the ROC leaders relocated the [[Republic of China Air Force]] to Taiwan,  taking over 80 flights and 3 ships.<ref name=\":3\" /> {{Interlanguage link|Chen Chin-chang|zh|\u9673\u9326\u660c|WD=}} writes in his book on the subject that an average of 50 or 60 planes flew daily between Taiwan and China transporting fuel and ammunition between August 1948 and December 1949.\n\nChiang also sent the [[Republic of China Navy|26 naval vessels]] of the Nationalist army to Taiwan. The final Communist assault against Nationalist forces began on {{Format date|1949|April|20}} and continued until the end of summer.  By August, the People's Liberation Army dominated almost all of mainland China; the Nationalists held only Taiwan and the [[Pescadores Islands]], [[Guangdong|Guangdong Province]], and a few regions in [[Western China|China's far west]].<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nInstitute of History and Philology director [[Fu Ssu-nien]] spearheaded a rush to persuade scholars to flee to Taiwan, as well as bringing books and documents.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Smuggling of treasures from the mainland ==\n[[File:Taiwan's treasure from Qing Dynasty.jpg|thumb|[[Meat-shaped Stone|Artifact]] from the Qing Dynasty, which resembles a piece of stewed pork (The Big Papie)]]\n{{Anchor|Gold and treasures taken from mainland China}}In 1948, Chiang Kai-shek began planning the KMT retreat to Taiwan with a plan to take gold and treasure from the mainland. The amount of gold that was moved differs according to sources, but it is usually estimated as between three million to five million [[tael]]s (approximately 113.6-115.2 tons; one tael is 37.2 grams). Other than gold, KMT brought old relics, which are now kept in the [[National Palace Museum]] in Taipei, Taiwan. Some scholars say the movement of gold and treasure was one of a number of protective measures against the Japanese invasion and occupation, similar to how European governments transferred gold to other locations during World War II. \n\nThere are different opinions on treasures that are at Taiwan's national palace museum. Some in China view the relocation as looting. Others believe these treasures have been accidentally protected, and might have been lost forever due to the [[Four Olds]] campaign during the [[Cultural Revolution]]. Others believe that Taiwan is still part of Chinese sovereign territory so the relocation is not an issue.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/06/17/national/museums-display-taiwans-treasures/|title=Museums to display Taiwan's treasures|last=Shu-Ling|first=Ko|date=2014-06-17|work=The Japan Times Online|access-date=2018-07-15|issn=0447-5763}}</ref>\n\nThe National Palace Museum claims that in 1948 when China was going through its Civil War, executive director [[Chu Chia-hua]] and others ([[Wang Shijie]], [[Fu Ssu-nien]], Xu Hong-Bao (Chinese:\u5f90\u6d2a\u5b9d), Li Ji (Chinese:\u674e\u6d4e), and [[Han Lih-wu]]) discussed shipping [[Masterpiece|masterpieces]] to Taiwan for the artifacts' safety.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npm.gov.tw/en/Article.aspx?sNo=03001502|title=Brief Chronology|last=Museum|first=National Palace|date=2017-05-17|website=National Palace Museum|access-date=2018-07-15}}</ref>   \n\nChiang Kai-shek's mission to take gold from China was held secretly because, according to Dr. [[Wu Sing-yung|Wu Sing-yung (Chinese:\u5434\u5174\u955b, Wu Xing-yong)]], the entire mission was operated by Chiang himself.

Chiang's ground forces aimed to return to the mainland, but had no long-term success. Thus Mao Zedong's Communist forces were left in control of all of China except [[Hainan Island]], [[Tibet]], and Taiwan.\n\nAs a whole, the Civil War had an immense impact on the [[Chinese people]].

The office was built by the [[Republic of China Armed Forces]] together with the [[Ministry of National Defense (Republic of China)|Ministry of National Defense]] in the town of [[Sanxia District|Sanxia]], [[Taipei County]] (now a district in [[New Taipei City]]).  Army [[Lieutenant General]] Zhu Yuancong took the role of governor and officially launched the project to compose a prudent plan of operations to recover the lost territories in mainland China. At the same time, the establishment of {{Clarify span|Project Juguan|Is this the same as Project Guoguan?|date=December 2018}} came to light whereby military members began to work out a possible alliance with American troops to attack mainland China.\n\n'''April 1964:'''  During this year, Chiang Kai-shek arranged an ensemble of air-raid shelters and five military offices at [[Cihu Mausoleum#Lake and residence|Lake Cihu]] ({{Lang-zh|c=|s=|t=\u6148\u6e56}}), which served as a secret command centre. Following the establishment of Project National Glory, several sub-plans were put into place, such as the frontal area of the enemy, rear area special warfare, [[surprise attack]], take advantage of the counterattack, and assistance against tyranny. \n\nHowever, the [[United States Armed Forces]] and the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]], together with the [[United States Department of State|State Department]], strongly opposed Project National Glory; rejecting the KMT plan to retake mainland China. Thus, every week American troops checked the inventory of [[Republic of China Marine Corps]] [[Amphibious vehicle|amphibious landing vehicles]] used by ROC and ordered American military advisory group members to fly over the Project National Glory camp on scouting missions. These flyovers infuriated Chiang Kai-Shek.\n\n'''June 17, 1965:'''  Chiang Kai-shek visited the [[Republic of China Military Academy]] to convene with all mid level and higher officers to devise and launch the counterattack.\n\n'''June 24, 1965:'''  A multitude of soldiers{{How many|date=November 2018}} died during a training drill to feign a Communist attack on major naval bases in southern Taiwan near [[Zuoying District]]. The deaths that occurred during the happening were the first but not the last in Project National Glory.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n'''August 6, 1965:'''  A [[People's Liberation Army Navy]] [[torpedo boat]] ambushed and sunk 200 soldiers as the ''Zhangjiang'' naval warship carried out assignment Tsunami Number 1, in an attempt to transport [[special forces]] to the vicinity of the Eastern mainland Chinese coastal island of [[Dongshan Island|Dongshan]] to carry out an [[Intelligence gathering network|intelligence gathering]] operation.\n\n'''November 1965:'''  Chiang Kai-shek ordered two other naval vessels, the ''CNS Shan Hai'' and the ''CNS Lin Huai'' to pick up injured soldiers from Taiwan's offshore islands of [[Magong]] and [[Wuqiu, Kinmen|Wuqiu]]. Nonetheless, the vessels were attacked by 12 PRC ships, the Lin Huai sunk, and roughly 90 soldiers and sailors were [[killed in action]]. Surprised by the heavy loss of life in the naval battle at Magong, Chiang gave up all hope for Project National Glory.\n\nAfter several unsuccessful feigned invasions between August 1971 and June 1973, in the lead up to the main landings, the 1973 coup which witnessed [[Nie Rongzhen]]'s rise to power in Beijing{{clarify|date=January 2019}} drove Chiang to call off all further false attacks and commence full landing operations. Having said this, according to Gen Huang Chih-chung, who was an army colonel at the time and part of the planning process, Chiang Kai-shek never completely gave up the desire to recapture China; \"even when he died (in 1975), he was still hoping the international situation would change and that the Communists would be wiped out one day.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Failure and shift of focus to modernization ===\nThe failure of Chiang's Project National Glory changed the course of Chinese and Taiwanese history, forever altering [[Cross-Strait relations|China-Taiwan relations]]. For example, the Taiwanese \u201cshifted the focus to modernizing and defending Taiwan instead of preparing Taiwan to take back China,\u201d stated Andrew Yang, a political scientist specializing in Taiwan-China relations at the Taipei-based Council of Advanced Policy Studies.<ref name=\":1\" /> Chiang Kai-shek's son [[Chiang Ching-kuo]], who later succeeded him as president, focused on maintaining peace between the mainland and Taiwan. Today, political relations between Taiwan and China have changed; \"I hope it will develop peacefully...

(1950)]]\nIn late 1949, having been almost destroyed by the Chinese Communists, the Kuomintang relocated to Taiwan and reinvented itself. Not only did the KMT leadership build a new party, but it built a new polity on Taiwan that created economic prosperity. From August 1950 to October 1952, more than four hundred working meetings were held almost four times a week to discuss how to build a new political party and implement Nationalist government policies. On August 5, 1950, Chiang chose the Central Reform Committee (CRC) to serve as the party's core leadership for planning and acting. The CRC members were on average young with an average age of 47 and all had [[Academic degree|college degrees]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.policyarchive.org/handle/10207/11838|title=Breaking with the Past: The Kuomintang Central Reform Committee on Taiwan, 1950-52 - PolicyArchive|website=www.policyarchive.org|access-date=2018-07-16}}</ref>\n\nThe new CRC had six goals. \n\n# Make the KMT a [[revolutionary]] democratic party.\n# Recruit peasants, workers, youth, intellectuals, and capitalists.\n# Adhere to [[democratic centralism]].\n# Establish the [[work team]] as the basic organizational unit.\n# Maintain high standards of leadership and obey the party's decisions,\n# Adopt Dr. [[Sun Yat-sen]]\u2019s [[Three Principles of the People]] as the KMT's ideology.\n\nAll CRC members took an oath to fulfill the party's ultimate goals which is to get rid of the Communists and recover the Chinese mainland.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=CIA memorandum ollenhauer meeting 23 October 1952 October 21 1952 secret nara|last=|first=|date=|doi = 10.1163/9789004287648.useo_b03301}}</ref>\n\n=== Expanding the Party's social foundation ===\nHaving organized a cohesive, loyal party, Chiang Kai-shek wanted to extend its influence deep into Taiwan's society in order to broaden its social base. One way to do that was to select new members from different socioeconomic groups. Various party branch members were ordered to recruit new members, especially students and teachers. New members had to show loyalty to the KMT party, understand what the party represented, obey party principles, and perform services for the party. In return, the CRC promised to pay attention to society's needs, which helped the CRC define a clear political purpose. Party policy also targeted ways to improve ordinary people's [[living conditions]]. Having new party branches made up of people of similar social status was a strategy that improved relations with workers, business leaders, farmers, intellectuals.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Moss|first=R. Maurice|title=Employment Opportunities and Working Conditions as Factors in Youth Development|journal=Social Service Review|volume=25|issue=4|pages=497\u2013500|doi=10.1086/638528|issn=0037-7961|year=1951}}</ref> With the new party branches promoting the various groups of people, the KMT was able slowly to extend its control and influence into Taiwan's villages. By October 1952, KMT membership had reached nearly 282,000, compared to the 50,000 members who had fled to Taiwan. More significant, more than half the party members were Taiwanese. By the late 1960s, this number had risen to nearly one million.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Marie|first=Laurence|date=2001-01-01|title=R de r\u00e9el|journal=Labyrinthe|issue=8|pages=123\u2013126|doi=10.4000/labyrinthe.872|issn=1288-6289}}</ref> \n\nCRC made its work teams responsible for enforcing party policies and informing members how to behave. They also prevented [[Communist Party of China|communist]] infiltration, and recruited new party members after investigating their backgrounds, in order to hold regular meetings to discuss party strategy. The new party, then, behaved very differently from the way it had before 1949, with its work teams having new managerial and training responsibilities. According to the KMT's new rules, all party members had to join a work team and attend its meetings so that the party leadership could discover who was loyal and active. According to one report, in the summer of 1952, the KMT's Taiwan provincial party headquarters had at least thirty thousand work-team units in the field, each unit having at least nine members who worked in various state agencies, areas of Taiwan, and occupations.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Current Publications Received|journal=The Social Studies|volume=43|issue=1|pages=47\u201348|doi=10.1080/00220973.1938.11017690|issn=0037-7996|year = 1952}}</ref> Gradually, the party expanded its influence in society and in the state.\n\n=== Local political reforms ===\nAn important KMT tactic was to promote limited, local-level political reforms to enhance the party's authority with the Taiwanese people. To legitimize the Republic of China (ROC) as the central government for all China, Taiwan's Nationalist government needed [[elected representatives]] for all China. Thus, in 1947 more than one thousand mainlanders in [[Nanking]] were [[Elections in the Republic of China|elected]] by the Chinese people as members of the [[National Assembly (Republic of China)|National Assembly]], [[Legislative Yuan]], and the [[Control Yuan]]. After coming to Taiwan, those representatives were permitted to hold their seats until the next ROC election could be held on the mainland, thus legitimizing the ROC's control of Taiwan.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wachman|first=Alan M.|title=Taiwan: A Political History.

Chiang Kai-shek believed that, in this authoritarian polity, local elections could promote [[Democracy in China|Taiwan's eventual democracy]]. People did not believe that the KMT would ever not interfere with such elections. However, having so many local elections in a year, many voters became convinced that the KMT wanted to advance [[Pluralist democracy|political pluralism]]. Party leaders tried to broaden their influence, while only slowly allowing opposing politicians to compete, by giving political lessons to teach voters how democracy should work. \n\nIn January 1951, the first elections for county and city council were held. In April, other elections followed for county and municipal offices. In December 1951, the [[Taiwan Provincial Consultative Council|Taiwan Provisional Provincial Assembly]] was organized. Its members were appointed by county and municipal assemblies.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kron, Jr, N F|date=1980-07-01|title=Development regulation changes local elected leaders can make to promote energy conservation|doi=10.2172/5865360|osti=5865360|url=https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5865360}}</ref> Through [[Martial law in Taiwan|martial law]] and the control of local election rules, the KMT won most of those local elections but claimed that [[free elections]] had been held. Chiang believed that enough [[liberty]] had been granted. Therefore, party leaders continued to emphasize that martial law was still necessary.\n\n== Views on the legality of the KMT takeover of Taiwan ==\nThere are opposing views on the legality of the KMT takeover of Taiwan. At the time of the retreat to Taiwan, the KMT maintained that they were a [[government in exile]]. The Chinese Communist government maintains to this day that the Republic of China on Taiwan is a renegade province that must eventually return to rule by the mainland. Thalia and Julian forever\n\nAccording to an article published in 1955 on the legal status of Taiwan, \"It has been charged that Chiang Kai-shek has no claim to the island because he is 'merely a fugitive quartering his army' there and besides, his is a government in exile.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Phillips|first=Claude S.|title=The International Legal Status of Formosa|journal=The Western Political Quarterly|volume=10|issue=2|pages=276\u2013289|doi=10.2307/443689|jstor=443689|year=1957|url=https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/68790/2/10.1177_106591295701000203.pdf}}</ref> Moreover, the [[Treaty of San Francisco]], which was officially signed by 48 nations on 8 September 1951, did not specify to whom Japan was ceding [[Geography of Taiwan|Taiwan]] and [[Pescadores]].  \n\nAccording to Professor Gene Hsiao, \"since the San Francisco Peace Treaty and the separate KMT treaty with Japan did not specify to whom Japan was ceding Taiwan and the Pescadores, the implication of the U.S. position was that legally, and insofar as the signatories of those two treaties were concerned, Taiwan became an 'ownerless' island and the KMT, by its own assent to the American policy, a foreign government-in-exile.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://homepage.usask.ca/~llr130/ctir1/ctir1.pdf|title=Let Taiwan be Taiwan|last=Marc J.

The need to eliminate the warlords was seen as necessary by both Mao Zedong and Chiang Kai-shek, but for different reasons. For Mao, their elimination would end the [[Feudalism in China|feudal system in China]], encouraging and preparing the country for [[Socialism (Marxism)|socialism]] and [[communism]]. For Chiang, the warlords were a great threat to the [[central government]]. This basic dissimilarity in motivation continued throughout the years of fighting against Japanese occupation in China, in spite of a common enemy.\n\nMao's Communist forces mobilized the peasantry in rural China against the Japanese, and at the time of the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender in 1945]] the Chinese Communist Party had built an army of nearly a million soldiers. The pressure Mao's forces placed on the Japanese benefitted the Soviet Union, and thus the CCP forces were supplied by the Soviets. The ideological unity of the CCP, and the experience acquired in fighting the Japanese, prepared it for the next battles against the Kuomintang. Though Chiang's forces were well equipped by the US, they lacked effective leadership, political unity and experience.  \n\nIn January 1949, Chiang Kai-shek stepped down as leader of the KMT and was replaced by his vice-president, [[Li Zongren]]. Li and Mao entered into negotiations for peace, but Nationalist hardliners rejected Mao's demands. \n\nThe Communist military capability was a deciding factor in resolving the impasse, and when Li sought an additional delay in mid-April 1949, the Chinese Red Army crossed the [[Yangtze]] (Chang) River. Chiang fled to the [[Geography of Taiwan|island of Formosa]] (Taiwan), where approximately 300,000 soldiers had already been [[Airlift|airlifted]]. \n\n== Relocation of forces and people ==\nOver the course of 4 months beginning in August 1948, the ROC leaders relocated the [[Republic of China Air Force]] to Taiwan,  taking over 80 flights and 3 ships.<ref name=\":3\" /> {{Interlanguage link|Chen Chin-chang|zh|\u9673\u9326\u660c|WD=}} writes in his book on the subject that an average of 50 or 60 planes flew daily between Taiwan and China transporting fuel and ammunition between August 1948 and December 1949.\n\nChiang also sent the [[Republic of China Navy|26 naval vessels]] of the Nationalist army to Taiwan.

The amount of gold that was moved differs according to sources, but it is usually estimated as between three million to five million [[tael]]s (approximately 113.6-115.2 tons; one tael is 37.2 grams). Other than gold, KMT brought old relics, which are now kept in the [[National Palace Museum]] in Taipei, Taiwan. Some scholars say the movement of gold and treasure was one of a number of protective measures against the Japanese invasion and occupation, similar to how European governments transferred gold to other locations during World War II. \n\nThere are different opinions on treasures that are at Taiwan's national palace museum. Some in China view the relocation as looting.

Thus, Chiang Kai-shek saw a [[Crisis-opportunity|crisis-opportunity]] to launch an attack to reclaim [[mainland China]].\n\nAt this time, the U.S. was fighting the [[Vietnam War]]. For Project National Glory to be successful Chiang Kai-shek knew he needed US military assistance.  Thus he offered to help the Americans fight the Vietnam War in exchange for U.S. support conducive to take back his lost territory. The U.S. opposed and refused Chiang's suggestions.{{Cn|date=December 2018}}  This did not stop him. Rather, Chiang went ahead with the preparations and continued to further his plan to take back their lost territory.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/chinese-rev|title=The Chinese Revolution of 1949|website=history.state.gov|access-date=2018-11-23}}</ref>\n\nIn 1965, Chiang's plans to strike were completed. His generals and admirals planned possible dates to deploy while soldiers and field officers prepared for battle, according to the government archives.\n\n=== Chronology ===\n'''April 1, 1961:'''  The year witnessed the advent of the Project National Glory. The office was built by the [[Republic of China Armed Forces]] together with the [[Ministry of National Defense (Republic of China)|Ministry of National Defense]] in the town of [[Sanxia District|Sanxia]], [[Taipei County]] (now a district in [[New Taipei City]]).  Army [[Lieutenant General]] Zhu Yuancong took the role of governor and officially launched the project to compose a prudent plan of operations to recover the lost territories in mainland China. At the same time, the establishment of {{Clarify span|Project Juguan|Is this the same as Project Guoguan?|date=December 2018}} came to light whereby military members began to work out a possible alliance with American troops to attack mainland China.\n\n'''April 1964:'''  During this year, Chiang Kai-shek arranged an ensemble of air-raid shelters and five military offices at [[Cihu Mausoleum#Lake and residence|Lake Cihu]] ({{Lang-zh|c=|s=|t=\u6148\u6e56}}), which served as a secret command centre. Following the establishment of Project National Glory, several sub-plans were put into place, such as the frontal area of the enemy, rear area special warfare, [[surprise attack]], take advantage of the counterattack, and assistance against tyranny. \n\nHowever, the [[United States Armed Forces]] and the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]], together with the [[United States Department of State|State Department]], strongly opposed Project National Glory; rejecting the KMT plan to retake mainland China. Thus, every week American troops checked the inventory of [[Republic of China Marine Corps]] [[Amphibious vehicle|amphibious landing vehicles]] used by ROC and ordered American military advisory group members to fly over the Project National Glory camp on scouting missions. These flyovers infuriated Chiang Kai-Shek.\n\n'''June 17, 1965:'''  Chiang Kai-shek visited the [[Republic of China Military Academy]] to convene with all mid level and higher officers to devise and launch the counterattack.\n\n'''June 24, 1965:'''  A multitude of soldiers{{How many|date=November 2018}} died during a training drill to feign a Communist attack on major naval bases in southern Taiwan near [[Zuoying District]]. The deaths that occurred during the happening were the first but not the last in Project National Glory.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n'''August 6, 1965:'''  A [[People's Liberation Army Navy]] [[torpedo boat]] ambushed and sunk 200 soldiers as the ''Zhangjiang'' naval warship carried out assignment Tsunami Number 1, in an attempt to transport [[special forces]] to the vicinity of the Eastern mainland Chinese coastal island of [[Dongshan Island|Dongshan]] to carry out an [[Intelligence gathering network|intelligence gathering]] operation.\n\n'''November 1965:'''  Chiang Kai-shek ordered two other naval vessels, the ''CNS Shan Hai'' and the ''CNS Lin Huai'' to pick up injured soldiers from Taiwan's offshore islands of [[Magong]] and [[Wuqiu, Kinmen|Wuqiu]]. Nonetheless, the vessels were attacked by 12 PRC ships, the Lin Huai sunk, and roughly 90 soldiers and sailors were [[killed in action]]. Surprised by the heavy loss of life in the naval battle at Magong, Chiang gave up all hope for Project National Glory.\n\nAfter several unsuccessful feigned invasions between August 1971 and June 1973, in the lead up to the main landings, the 1973 coup which witnessed [[Nie Rongzhen]]'s rise to power in Beijing{{clarify|date=January 2019}} drove Chiang to call off all further false attacks and commence full landing operations. Having said this, according to Gen Huang Chih-chung, who was an army colonel at the time and part of the planning process, Chiang Kai-shek never completely gave up the desire to recapture China; \"even when he died (in 1975), he was still hoping the international situation would change and that the Communists would be wiped out one day.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Failure and shift of focus to modernization ===\nThe failure of Chiang's Project National Glory changed the course of Chinese and Taiwanese history, forever altering [[Cross-Strait relations|China-Taiwan relations]]. For example, the Taiwanese \u201cshifted the focus to modernizing and defending Taiwan instead of preparing Taiwan to take back China,\u201d stated Andrew Yang, a political scientist specializing in Taiwan-China relations at the Taipei-based Council of Advanced Policy Studies.<ref name=\":1\" /> Chiang Kai-shek's son [[Chiang Ching-kuo]], who later succeeded him as president, focused on maintaining peace between the mainland and Taiwan. Today, political relations between Taiwan and China have changed; \"I hope it will develop peacefully... There's no need for war.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Reform of the Kuomintang ==\nAfter being expelled from the mainland, Chiang Kai-shek and other KMT leaders realized they must reform the party.[[File:Emblem of the Kuomintang.svg|alt=Founded October 24, 1919; 99 years ago|thumb|Party flag and emblem of the [[Kuomintang]]; based on the [[Blue Sky with a White Sun]], which also appears in the [[Flag of the Republic of China]].]]\n=== Reinventing a new political party ===\n[[File:Crc meeting.jpg|thumb|262x262px|In August 1950, the KMT held its first Central reform Committee meeting to launch the party's reforms. (1950)]]\nIn late 1949, having been almost destroyed by the Chinese Communists, the Kuomintang relocated to Taiwan and reinvented itself. Not only did the KMT leadership build a new party, but it built a new polity on Taiwan that created economic prosperity. From August 1950 to October 1952, more than four hundred working meetings were held almost four times a week to discuss how to build a new political party and implement Nationalist government policies. On August 5, 1950, Chiang chose the Central Reform Committee (CRC) to serve as the party's core leadership for planning and acting. The CRC members were on average young with an average age of 47 and all had [[Academic degree|college degrees]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.policyarchive.org/handle/10207/11838|title=Breaking with the Past: The Kuomintang Central Reform Committee on Taiwan, 1950-52 - PolicyArchive|website=www.policyarchive.org|access-date=2018-07-16}}</ref>\n\nThe new CRC had six goals. \n\n# Make the KMT a [[revolutionary]] democratic party.\n# Recruit peasants, workers, youth, intellectuals, and capitalists.\n# Adhere to [[democratic centralism]].\n# Establish the [[work team]] as the basic organizational unit.\n# Maintain high standards of leadership and obey the party's decisions,\n# Adopt Dr. [[Sun Yat-sen]]\u2019s [[Three Principles of the People]] as the KMT's ideology.\n\nAll CRC members took an oath to fulfill the party's ultimate goals which is to get rid of the Communists and recover the Chinese mainland.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=CIA memorandum ollenhauer meeting 23 October 1952 October 21 1952 secret nara|last=|first=|date=|doi = 10.1163/9789004287648.useo_b03301}}</ref>\n\n=== Expanding the Party's social foundation ===\nHaving organized a cohesive, loyal party, Chiang Kai-shek wanted to extend its influence deep into Taiwan's society in order to broaden its social base. One way to do that was to select new members from different socioeconomic groups. Various party branch members were ordered to recruit new members, especially students and teachers. New members had to show loyalty to the KMT party, understand what the party represented, obey party principles, and perform services for the party. In return, the CRC promised to pay attention to society's needs, which helped the CRC define a clear political purpose. Party policy also targeted ways to improve ordinary people's [[living conditions]]. Having new party branches made up of people of similar social status was a strategy that improved relations with workers, business leaders, farmers, intellectuals.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Moss|first=R. Maurice|title=Employment Opportunities and Working Conditions as Factors in Youth Development|journal=Social Service Review|volume=25|issue=4|pages=497\u2013500|doi=10.1086/638528|issn=0037-7961|year=1951}}</ref> With the new party branches promoting the various groups of people, the KMT was able slowly to extend its control and influence into Taiwan's villages. By October 1952, KMT membership had reached nearly 282,000, compared to the 50,000 members who had fled to Taiwan. More significant, more than half the party members were Taiwanese. By the late 1960s, this number had risen to nearly one million.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Marie|first=Laurence|date=2001-01-01|title=R de r\u00e9el|journal=Labyrinthe|issue=8|pages=123\u2013126|doi=10.4000/labyrinthe.872|issn=1288-6289}}</ref> \n\nCRC made its work teams responsible for enforcing party policies and informing members how to behave. They also prevented [[Communist Party of China|communist]] infiltration, and recruited new party members after investigating their backgrounds, in order to hold regular meetings to discuss party strategy. The new party, then, behaved very differently from the way it had before 1949, with its work teams having new managerial and training responsibilities. According to the KMT's new rules, all party members had to join a work team and attend its meetings so that the party leadership could discover who was loyal and active. According to one report, in the summer of 1952, the KMT's Taiwan provincial party headquarters had at least thirty thousand work-team units in the field, each unit having at least nine members who worked in various state agencies, areas of Taiwan, and occupations.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Current Publications Received|journal=The Social Studies|volume=43|issue=1|pages=47\u201348|doi=10.1080/00220973.1938.11017690|issn=0037-7996|year = 1952}}</ref> Gradually, the party expanded its influence in society and in the state.\n\n=== Local political reforms ===\nAn important KMT tactic was to promote limited, local-level political reforms to enhance the party's authority with the Taiwanese people. To legitimize the Republic of China (ROC) as the central government for all China, Taiwan's Nationalist government needed [[elected representatives]] for all China. Thus, in 1947 more than one thousand mainlanders in [[Nanking]] were [[Elections in the Republic of China|elected]] by the Chinese people as members of the [[National Assembly (Republic of China)|National Assembly]], [[Legislative Yuan]], and the [[Control Yuan]]. After coming to Taiwan, those representatives were permitted to hold their seats until the next ROC election could be held on the mainland, thus legitimizing the ROC's control of Taiwan.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wachman|first=Alan M.|title=Taiwan: A Political History. By Denny Roy. Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 2003. xiii, 255 pp. $18.95 (paper).|journal=The Journal of Asian Studies|volume=63|issue=1|pages=166\u2013167|doi=10.1017/s0021911804000324|issn=0021-9118|year=2004}}</ref> \n\nIn this new political environment, the reformed KMT and the ROC government were able to propose their new power. Chiang Kai-shek believed that, in this authoritarian polity, local elections could promote [[Democracy in China|Taiwan's eventual democracy]]. People did not believe that the KMT would ever not interfere with such elections. However, having so many local elections in a year, many voters became convinced that the KMT wanted to advance [[Pluralist democracy|political pluralism]]. Party leaders tried to broaden their influence, while only slowly allowing opposing politicians to compete, by giving political lessons to teach voters how democracy should work. \n\nIn January 1951, the first elections for county and city council were held. In April, other elections followed for county and municipal offices. In December 1951, the [[Taiwan Provincial Consultative Council|Taiwan Provisional Provincial Assembly]] was organized. Its members were appointed by county and municipal assemblies.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kron, Jr, N F|date=1980-07-01|title=Development regulation changes local elected leaders can make to promote energy conservation|doi=10.2172/5865360|osti=5865360|url=https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5865360}}</ref> Through [[Martial law in Taiwan|martial law]] and the control of local election rules, the KMT won most of those local elections but claimed that [[free elections]] had been held. Chiang believed that enough [[liberty]] had been granted. Therefore, party leaders continued to emphasize that martial law was still necessary.\n\n== Views on the legality of the KMT takeover of Taiwan ==\nThere are opposing views on the legality of the KMT takeover of Taiwan. At the time of the retreat to Taiwan, the KMT maintained that they were a [[government in exile]]. The Chinese Communist government maintains to this day that the Republic of China on Taiwan is a renegade province that must eventually return to rule by the mainland.\n\nAccording to an article published in 1955 on the legal status of Taiwan, \"It has been charged that Chiang Kai-shek has no claim to the island because he is 'merely a fugitive quartering his army' there and besides, his is a government in exile.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Phillips|first=Claude S.|title=The International Legal Status of Formosa|journal=The Western Political Quarterly|volume=10|issue=2|pages=276\u2013289|doi=10.2307/443689|jstor=443689|year=1957|url=https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/68790/2/10.1177_106591295701000203.pdf}}</ref> Moreover, the [[Treaty of San Francisco]], which was officially signed by 48 nations on 8 September 1951, did not specify to whom Japan was ceding [[Geography of Taiwan|Taiwan]] and [[Pescadores]].  \n\nAccording to Professor Gene Hsiao, \"since the San Francisco Peace Treaty and the separate KMT treaty with Japan did not specify to whom Japan was ceding Taiwan and the Pescadores, the implication of the U.S. position was that legally, and insofar as the signatories of those two treaties were concerned, Taiwan became an 'ownerless' island and the KMT, by its own assent to the American policy, a foreign government-in-exile.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://homepage.usask.ca/~llr130/ctir1/ctir1.pdf|title=Let Taiwan be Taiwan|last=Marc J.

Crosley had the {{convert|11000|ft2|m2|adj=on}}, [[Mediterranean Revival architecture|Mediterranean Revival]]-style home built in 1929 for his wife, Gwendolyn, on {{convert|45|acre|hectare|adj=on}} of land along [[Sarasota Bay]] that was platted in 1925 for a failed subdivision. New York architect [[George Albree Freeman Jr.]] designed the home; [[Ivo A. de Minicis]], a [[Tampa, Florida]], architect, drafted the plans; and [[Paul W. Bergmann]], a Sarasota contractor, reportedly built the two-and-a-half story, cast stone and stucco home in 135 days. Gwendolyn Crosley died at Seagate in 1939. After allowing the [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]] to use the home for airmen who were training at a nearby airbase during [[World War II]], Crosley sold the property in 1947. [[Freeman Horton]] and his wife, Mabel, bought it the following year. (Freeman Horton was a civil engineer who proposed the construction of the original [[Sunshine Skyway Bridge]] across [[Tampa Bay]].) The Horton family lived on the estate from 1948 to 1977. The [[Campeau Corporation|Campeau Corporation of America]] acquired the property in the early 1980s, intending to develop it into condominium units and use the residence serving as the development's clubhouse, but its plans failed. The Crosley home and {{convert|45|acre|hectare}} of adjacent property were formally added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on January 21, 1983.\n\n[[Friends of Seagate Inc.]], a local, nonprofit preservation group led efforts to preserve the historic property and its remaining undeveloped land in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The Manatee County, Florida, government purchased acquired the home and {{convert|16.5|acre|hectare}} of the property in 1991 for $1.6 million; the University of South Florida purchased the estate's remaining {{convert|28.4|acre|hectare}} for $2 million for future expansion. The present-day Crosley home and {{convert|16.5|acre|hectare}} of land are operated as an event rental property. The university's {{convert|28.4|acre|hectare|adj=on}} tract of land that was part of the former Seagate estate, included in the national register nomination, is the present-day site of the [[University of South Florida Sarasota-Manatee]] campus.\n\n==History==\n===Property location===\nArchaeological studies made at the site in late 1980s/early 1990s suggest that the [[Calusa]] inhabited the area during the archaic period. Nearby fresh water access is documented in early plats that may have been constant, since adjacent middens attest to a long period of occupation.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Allan Horton, a longtime resident of Manatee County and a former resident of the Seagate estate,<ref>{{cite web| author=Allan Horton and Puneet Sandhu| title =Allan Horton recounts his lifelong experiences sailing and writing | work = Sarasota County Water Atlas Oral History Project (Transcript of Interview with Allan Horton) | publisher = New College of Florida | date = Fall 2010 | url =http://www.sarasota.wateratlas.usf.edu/upload/documents/TranscriptHorton.pdf | accessdate =May 14, 2018}}</ref> described a distinctive structure on the property  as a compacted, raised earthen platform that was elevated evenly at {{convert|18|in|cm}} to {{convert|24|in|cm}}, with a perfectly circular diameter of {{convert|32|ft|m}}.<!--the circumference was just greater than {{convert|100|ft|m}}--> The structure reportedly resembled the ancient dancing or ceremonial platform that archaeologists had discovered elsewhere in the state. An entrance sign for a drive-in theater, the landmark that Horton used to locate the structure, was demolished on an adjacent parcel, making the potentially ancient structure's location difficult to find. Also, a path for electrical service poles that traversed the area had disturbed an area with mounds nearby, possibly destroying the structure in the process.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nThe site of the Seagate property was once part of [[Hillsborough County, Florida]], which was established in 1834,{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} following the United States' acquisition of the Florida territory from [[Spain]] in 1821.<ref>{{cite book |author=James A.

Seagate bears a property address and a postal designation of Sarasota; however, when Hillsborough County was subdivided to establish additional counties, governmental oversight for the area went to [[Manatee County, Florida]], which was subsequently subdivided to create more counties, including [[Sarasota County, Florida]], in 1921. The arbitrary line chosen to delineate Manatee County from Sarasota County was drawn at the southern boundary of Seagate and everything to the north remained within Manatee County. Sarasota addresses remain from that line to the creek.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n===Development in 1929===\n[[Image:1940s advertisement 83d40m w Crosley image .png|thumb|150px|Powel Crosley, Jr. in 1940s advertisement\u2013''Sarasota History Center'']]\n\nIn 1929 a wealthy [[industrialist]] named [[Powel Crosley Jr.]] purchased a {{convert|63|acre|hectare|adj=on}} parcel of bay-front property and had a built a winter retreat along [[Sarasota Bay]] for his wife, Gwendolyn B.

Crosley had the {{convert|11000|ft2|m2|adj=on}}, [[Mediterranean Revival architecture|Mediterranean Revival]]-style home built in 1929 for his wife, Gwendolyn, on {{convert|45|acre|hectare|adj=on}} of land along [[Sarasota Bay]] that was platted in 1925 for a failed subdivision. New York architect [[George Albree Freeman Jr.]] designed the home; [[Ivo A. de Minicis]], a [[Tampa, Florida]], architect, drafted the plans; and [[Paul W. Bergmann]], a Sarasota contractor, reportedly built the two-and-a-half story, cast stone and stucco home in 135 days. Gwendolyn Crosley died at Seagate in 1939. After allowing the [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]] to use the home for airmen who were training at a nearby airbase during [[World War II]], Crosley sold the property in 1947. [[Freeman Horton]] and his wife, Mabel, bought it the following year. (Freeman Horton was a civil engineer who proposed the construction of the original [[Sunshine Skyway Bridge]] across [[Tampa Bay]].) The Horton family lived on the estate from 1948 to 1977. The [[Campeau Corporation|Campeau Corporation of America]] acquired the property in the early 1980s, intending to develop it into condominium units and use the residence serving as the development's clubhouse, but its plans failed. The Crosley home and {{convert|45|acre|hectare}} of adjacent property were formally added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on January 21, 1983.\n\n[[Friends of Seagate Inc.]], a local, nonprofit preservation group led efforts to preserve the historic property and its remaining undeveloped land in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The Manatee County, Florida, government purchased acquired the home and {{convert|16.5|acre|hectare}} of the property in 1991 for $1.6 million; the University of South Florida purchased the estate's remaining {{convert|28.4|acre|hectare}} for $2 million for future expansion. The present-day Crosley home and {{convert|16.5|acre|hectare}} of land are operated as an event rental property. The university's {{convert|28.4|acre|hectare|adj=on}} tract of land that was part of the former Seagate estate, included in the national register nomination, is the present-day site of the [[University of South Florida Sarasota-Manatee]] campus.\n\n==History==\n===Property location===\nArchaeological studies made at the site in late 1980s/early 1990s suggest that the [[Calusa]] inhabited the area during the archaic period.

An entrance sign for a drive-in theater, the landmark that Horton used to locate the structure, was demolished on an adjacent parcel, making the potentially ancient structure's location difficult to find. Also, a path for electrical service poles that traversed the area had disturbed an area with mounds nearby, possibly destroying the structure in the process.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nThe site of the Seagate property was once part of [[Hillsborough County, Florida]], which was established in 1834,{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} following the United States' acquisition of the Florida territory from [[Spain]] in 1821.<ref>{{cite book |author=James A.

Seagate bears a property address and a postal designation of Sarasota; however, when Hillsborough County was subdivided to establish additional counties, governmental oversight for the area went to [[Manatee County, Florida]], which was subsequently subdivided to create more counties, including [[Sarasota County, Florida]], in 1921. The arbitrary line chosen to delineate Manatee County from Sarasota County was drawn at the southern boundary of Seagate and everything to the north remained within Manatee County. Sarasota addresses remain from that line to the creek.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n===Development in 1929===\n[[Image:1940s advertisement 83d40m w Crosley image .png|thumb|150px|Powel Crosley, Jr. in 1940s advertisement\u2013''Sarasota History Center'']]\n\nIn 1929 a wealthy [[industrialist]] named [[Powel Crosley Jr.]] purchased a {{convert|63|acre|hectare|adj=on}} parcel of bay-front property and had a built a winter retreat along [[Sarasota Bay]] for his wife, Gwendolyn B.

The university's history dates back to the emergence of dental schools in Russia in the [[19th century in Russia|19th century]].\n\n= History =\n== Establishment ==\nThe history of Moscow State University of Medicine and Dentistry (MSUMD) dates back to the 19th century, when the first dental school was opened in [[Moscow]] by I.M. Kovarsky. Later, when the [[Soviet-Russia|Soviets came to power in Russia]], it was turned into the House of Soviet Dentistry, and was called upon to tackle a tremendous task of organizing dental health services for the population. The main purpose of MSUMD has always been to train highly qualified medical professionals. Several prominent Russian health care figures who had played a prominent role in establishing the university made a point of including dentistry in the curriculum of the medical school, including [[N.A. Semashko]], [[P.G. Dauge]], [[M.\u0412. Yankovsky]] and [[A.I. Yevdokimov]].\n\n== Early Soviet years==\n\nIn February 1920, when the Kovarsky dental school went under the jurisdiction of Narkomzdrav ([[People's Commissariat of Health|the People's Commissariat of Health]]), the Kovarsky school was transformed into a dental research center by the decision of Narkomzdrav's dental health division in order to bring together all dental care units that existed at the time in different parts of Moscow \u2014 a demonstration dispensary, a chemical laboratory, and the Kovarsky institution itself. The center was named the House of Soviet Dentistry (HSD) and among its main purposes were the retraining of former dentists into oral care consultants, and the preparation of secondary dental personnel, such as dental mechanics, filling and prosthetic specialists, and chair side assistants. \n\nFirst renamed in December, 1920, the HSD's official opening took place two years later in April 1922, when again it was given a different name. This time it was the State Institute of Dentistry (SID), which was to be headed by M.\u0412. Yankovsky, who directed his staff in an in-depth study of Dentistry and [[Odontology]] before anything else; the two major problems to be solved were [[tooth decay]] and [[periodontal disease]]. Among those who joined efforts in the study of these problems were scientists such as professors Ya.S. Utshtem, M.S. Nemenov, M.\u041e. Kovarsky, N.M.  Vilnik, and A.I. Yevdokimov, who replaced M.\u0412. Yankovsky at the post after his death in January 1923. A.I. Yevdokimov made large contributions of his own in the SID's development and that earned him the titles of [[Honored Scientist of the Russian Federation]], a corresponding member of the Academy of Medical Sciences of the USSR and of [[Hero of Socialist Labor]]. Another new name, that of the State Institute of Stomatology and Odontology (SISO) was given in April 1927 by decree of the [[Sovnarkom]] (the Soviet government). The SISO was to continue the job of training dentists through a specially organized refresher course for dental professionals and a dental specialization course for general medicine faculties. This helped to streamline the public dental health care as well as carry on with scientific research in the fields of dental and oral pathology and therapy, [[maxillofacial surgery]], [[orthodontics]], and [[prosthodontics]].\n\nIn 1932, the SISO was renamed yet again, this time to the State Research Institute of Stomatology and Odontology (SRISO) and from then on it was concerned mostly with scientific research problems. There were no educational departments in it at the time, those having been replaced by newly formed divisions for pathological [[physiology]], morphology, [[surgery]] and social dentistry instead, to which a steel prosthetics laboratory was added. Another, central, laboratory for prosthetics research was set up a year later in 1933 to manufacture steel dentures on a large scale.\n\n== Years as Moscow Stomatological Institute ==\n\nThe Moscow Stomatological Institute (MSI) as a higher dental school was established under the Narkomzdrav's order dated June 9, 1935, as a subdivision within the SRISO's framework. Both institutions were housed in one building, sharing administration, finances and facilities. Thus, the MSI became the only institution in the Russian Soviet Federal Socialist Republic (RSFSR) that was to conduct scientific research in dentistry, translate the results obtained into everyday dental care practices and train dental professionals as well. Since 1935 a whole number of departments were being added to the institute those of normal anatomy, biology, general chemistry, histology, embryology, and, finally, in 1937 the departments of oral therapy, oral surgery and prosthodontics.\n\nIn line with the resolution of the RSFSR Narkomzdrav of September 1, 1939, the SRISO and MSI were united to become the Moscow State Stomatology Institute (MSSI) with associate professor D. S. Dyshlis as Director. That year witnessed the first batch of 79 graduates trained by the new institution. By the time World War II broke out, the Moscow State Stomatology Institute included 25 departments involved in the studies of dental caries, [[periodontitis]], oral mucous membrane lesions, and maxillofacial injuries.\n\nIn the first days of the war, the MSSI's 1941 graduates were called up to serve in the Red Army or Navy. Among the graduates were V.I. Zausaev who operated on an open heart in a field hospital and who later became a professor and a department head, G.M. Ivaschenko who joined the Army as Chief Dentist, A.I. Doimkov and V.F. Rudko who also gained professorship after the war. To provide the front with dentists, the MSSI put up a special crash course in October, 1941. The MSSI's director, associate professor D.S. Dyshlis, was sent to Izhevsk to make all the necessary arrangements for evacuating the institute to that town, but then the idea was given up. Instead, the MSSI premises in Dolgorukovskaya Street were used to lay out a 50-bed maxillofacial hospital staffed with the institute's polyclinical personnel and the Dentistry department undergraduates. Because of this, over 85% of soldiers with maxillofacial wounds were able to return to the front unscathed. On October 1, 1943, the Moscow State Stomatology Institute opened its doors to students again and about a year later, in February, 1944, A.I.  Yevdokimov was appointed its director.\n\n== After [[World War II]] and [[Khrushchev Thaw]] ==\n\nAfter the war the training of dental care professionals became vital again. So on October 15, 1949, by decision of the USSR Council of Ministers, former dental schools were reorganized into general medicine and dentistry institutes with a 5-year course of studies. The Moscow State Stomatology Institute was again renamed to become the Moscow Medical Stomatology Institute (MMSI), which became famous as the country's research and consulting center on all dentistry-related issues.\n\nIn 1950, associate professor G.N. Beletskiy, a prominent public health worker, was appointed as MMSI director Under his leadership, a student enrollment to the institution went up significantly, the existing clinical medicine facilities were enlarged and new teaching hospitals went under construction, the standards of training research and teaching staff also having much improved. Moreover, two more faculties were launched, part-time and correspondence ones.\n\nFrom 1964 to 1965, the institute was headed by Prof A.I. Doimkov. For many years professor he acted as Chief Dentist of the USSR Ministry of Health administration division No 4 that was in charge of providing dental services to members of the Soviet government and top officials from other countries.\n\nFrom 1965 to 1968, the post of Rector of the MMSI was held by Professor S.I. Babichev, head of the institute's Surgical Disease department. It was he who initiated the idea of incorporating a General Medicine Faculty into the MMSI. On the basis of the Eye Disease department led by Prof S.N. Fyodorov an ophthalmologic research laboratory was created in 1967. The research staff under Prof S.N. Fyodorv looked into a wide range of scientific and practical problems of eye disorders and that, having eventually crowned with success, allowed him to turn the laboratory into what is now known internationally as the Microsurgery of the Eye scientific research institute.\n\n== [[Brezhnev era|Brezhnev years]] and [[Perestroika]] ==\n\nDuring the period of time from 1968 to 1974 when the institute was headed by Prof A.Z. Belousov, the proposal of setting up a general medicine faculty won his support and was realized in 1968. The emergence of the new faculty that was to cater for the need in medical professionals by the city of Moscow and its surroundings called for employment of more teaching staff for a number of the existing departments (those of Foreign Languages, Anatomy, Physiology, Biology, Histology, Physics and General Chemistry, Microbiology and Pharmacology and others) as well as for putting up new courses and departments. These were launched a year later, staffed with qualified specialists and office workers that helped improve the work of the Faculty's administration and dean's offices. That same year, the MMSI opened an advanced training faculty for medical professionals with departments for dental and general practitioners which was followed by opening in 1975 of a faculty for advanced training of teaching staff.\n\nFrom 1974 to 1982, Professor \u041a.M. Lakin, corresponding member of the [[USSR Academy of Medical Sciences]], headed the institution. He proved very successful with his studies of thromboembolic and hemorrhagic disease prevention and treatment, the results of which have been widely applied in medical practice. Working in this field he virtually laid the foundation of the hemostasis pharmacology school. His time at the MMSI is marked by putting into operation a Clinical Dentistry Center in Moscow in 1976. It was designed to cater for 2 000 out-patients and 50 in-patients a day and housed a number of the Institute's dental teaching hospital departments.\n\n== In modern Russia ==\n\nThe decades that followed (1982 to 2002) saw Professor Ye.I. Sokolov as the Rector. As head of the Internal Disease department, he became known for his research into the problems of ischemic heart disease, correction of hemostasis disturbances, and clinical psychophysiology, which brought him success and were immediately put to medical use. Under Professor Ye.I. Sokolov's leadership, the Dentistry faculty premises were greatly enlarged and new departments added to both Dentistry and General Medicine faculties, as well as output of graduates increased. In 1986 \u0430 part-time faculty for dental students was opened, in 1995 - that for post-graduate students, and, in 1998, a secondary medical education faculty was launched to train dental mechanics. Two more to come were a refresher course for dental specialists and the Clinical Psychology faculty, in 1999 and 2001 respectively. Towards the end of the decade, another change of name was in store for the Institution, this time by the orders of the Ministries for General and Vocational Education and that for Public Health of the Russian Federation (RF) dated June 10, 1999. These granted the MMSI a university status with a full name from then on of Moscow State University of Medicine and Dentistry (MSUMD) under the RF Ministry of Public Health.\n\n= Rector of the University =\n\nDuring the five years after Professor Ye.I. Sokolov's resignation in 2002 the University was led by Professor N.D. Yushchuk, a RAS and RAMS academician, RF Honored Scientist, government prize winner, head of the University's Infectious Disease and Epidemiology department. The department's staff is known to take an active part in the work of the Moscow and All-Russia scientific societies of infectionists, microbiologists, epidemiologists and parasitologists, many being members on those societies' boards. This helped to spread new ideas within the country's medical community. The rector paid great attention to the introduction of latest techniques of teaching and assessment of higher school and post-graduate students into the university's practice taking due account of latest pedagogy and medical psychology techniques. Professor N.D. Yuschuk was an active participant in the development of a new effective test control system aimed at better assessment of students' progress. The system was first tried at the time of state assessment of MSMDU students upon graduation and later approved for use by other medical colleges in Russia. It was under Prof N.D. Yuschuk that a scheme was developed, and is now successfully used, for a continuous medical education when a higher medical is to be followed by postgraduate courses (internship, residency, specialization, retraining, and refresher). As to the university's new educational facilities that sprang into being in 2002, they include the faculty of Health Economics and Management (2004), the Moscow Region faculty (2005), and that of Penitentiary Medicine (2006).\n\nOn May 15, 2007, Professor O.O. Yanushevich, head of the MSMDU Periodontology and Geriatric Dentistry department, was elected rector in a ballot by a university staff meeting that was also unanimous in voting for the former rector, academician N.D. Yuschuk, as the University President.\n\nHimself a graduate of the MSUMD, the Rector elected worked for a number of years at the University's Hospital Oral Therapy Department. Today, he has over 50 scientific papers on topical periodontal problems to his credit.\n\n= Notable faculty =\n* Oleg Yanushevich, DDM - rector of MSUMD, professor, honored doctor of Russia.\n* [[Anatoly Sharpenak]] (1895 - 1969) - scholar and biochemist, Professor.

Among the graduates were V.I. Zausaev who operated on an open heart in a field hospital and who later became a professor and a department head, G.M. Ivaschenko who joined the Army as Chief Dentist, A.I. Doimkov and V.F. Rudko who also gained professorship after the war. To provide the front with dentists, the MSSI put up a special crash course in October, 1941. The MSSI's director, associate professor D.S. Dyshlis, was sent to Izhevsk to make all the necessary arrangements for evacuating the institute to that town, but then the idea was given up. Instead, the MSSI premises in Dolgorukovskaya Street were used to lay out a 50-bed maxillofacial hospital staffed with the institute's polyclinical personnel and the Dentistry department undergraduates. Because of this, over 85% of soldiers with maxillofacial wounds were able to return to the front unscathed. On October 1, 1943, the Moscow State Stomatology Institute opened its doors to students again and about a year later, in February, 1944, A.I.  Yevdokimov was appointed its director.\n\n== After [[World War II]] and [[Khrushchev Thaw]] ==\n\nAfter the war the training of dental care professionals became vital again. So on October 15, 1949, by decision of the USSR Council of Ministers, former dental schools were reorganized into general medicine and dentistry institutes with a 5-year course of studies. The Moscow State Stomatology Institute was again renamed to become the Moscow Medical Stomatology Institute (MMSI), which became famous as the country's research and consulting center on all dentistry-related issues.\n\nIn 1950, associate professor G.N. Beletskiy, a prominent public health worker, was appointed as MMSI director Under his leadership, a student enrollment to the institution went up significantly, the existing clinical medicine facilities were enlarged and new teaching hospitals went under construction, the standards of training research and teaching staff also having much improved. Moreover, two more faculties were launched, part-time and correspondence ones.\n\nFrom 1964 to 1965, the institute was headed by Prof A.I. Doimkov. For many years professor he acted as Chief Dentist of the USSR Ministry of Health administration division No 4 that was in charge of providing dental services to members of the Soviet government and top officials from other countries.\n\nFrom 1965 to 1968, the post of Rector of the MMSI was held by Professor S.I. Babichev, head of the institute's Surgical Disease department. It was he who initiated the idea of incorporating a General Medicine Faculty into the MMSI. On the basis of the Eye Disease department led by Prof S.N. Fyodorov an ophthalmologic research laboratory was created in 1967. The research staff under Prof S.N. Fyodorv looked into a wide range of scientific and practical problems of eye disorders and that, having eventually crowned with success, allowed him to turn the laboratory into what is now known internationally as the Microsurgery of the Eye scientific research institute.\n\n== [[Brezhnev era|Brezhnev years]] and [[Perestroika]] ==\n\nDuring the period of time from 1968 to 1974 when the institute was headed by Prof A.Z. Belousov, the proposal of setting up a general medicine faculty won his support and was realized in 1968. The emergence of the new faculty that was to cater for the need in medical professionals by the city of Moscow and its surroundings called for employment of more teaching staff for a number of the existing departments (those of Foreign Languages, Anatomy, Physiology, Biology, Histology, Physics and General Chemistry, Microbiology and Pharmacology and others) as well as for putting up new courses and departments. These were launched a year later, staffed with qualified specialists and office workers that helped improve the work of the Faculty's administration and dean's offices. That same year, the MMSI opened an advanced training faculty for medical professionals with departments for dental and general practitioners which was followed by opening in 1975 of a faculty for advanced training of teaching staff.\n\nFrom 1974 to 1982, Professor \u041a.M. Lakin, corresponding member of the [[USSR Academy of Medical Sciences]], headed the institution. He proved very successful with his studies of thromboembolic and hemorrhagic disease prevention and treatment, the results of which have been widely applied in medical practice. Working in this field he virtually laid the foundation of the hemostasis pharmacology school. His time at the MMSI is marked by putting into operation a Clinical Dentistry Center in Moscow in 1976. It was designed to cater for 2 000 out-patients and 50 in-patients a day and housed a number of the Institute's dental teaching hospital departments.\n\n== In modern Russia ==\n\nThe decades that followed (1982 to 2002) saw Professor Ye.I. Sokolov as the Rector. As head of the Internal Disease department, he became known for his research into the problems of ischemic heart disease, correction of hemostasis disturbances, and clinical psychophysiology, which brought him success and were immediately put to medical use. Under Professor Ye.I. Sokolov's leadership, the Dentistry faculty premises were greatly enlarged and new departments added to both Dentistry and General Medicine faculties, as well as output of graduates increased. In 1986 \u0430 part-time faculty for dental students was opened, in 1995 - that for post-graduate students, and, in 1998, a secondary medical education faculty was launched to train dental mechanics. Two more to come were a refresher course for dental specialists and the Clinical Psychology faculty, in 1999 and 2001 respectively. Towards the end of the decade, another change of name was in store for the Institution, this time by the orders of the Ministries for General and Vocational Education and that for Public Health of the Russian Federation (RF) dated June 10, 1999. These granted the MMSI a university status with a full name from then on of Moscow State University of Medicine and Dentistry (MSUMD) under the RF Ministry of Public Health.\n\n== Rector of the University ==\n\nDuring the five years after Professor Ye.I. Sokolov's resignation in 2002 the University was led by Professor N.D. Yushchuk, a RAS and RAMS academician, RF Honored Scientist, government prize winner, head of the University's Infectious Disease and Epidemiology department. The department's staff is known to take an active part in the work of the Moscow and All-Russia scientific societies of infectionists, microbiologists, epidemiologists and parasitologists, many being members on those societies' boards. This helped to spread new ideas within the country's medical community. The rector paid great attention to the introduction of latest techniques of teaching and assessment of higher school and post-graduate students into the university's practice taking due account of latest pedagogy and medical psychology techniques. Professor N.D. Yuschuk was an active participant in the development of a new effective test control system aimed at better assessment of students' progress. The system was first tried at the time of state assessment of MSMDU students upon graduation and later approved for use by other medical colleges in Russia. It was under Prof N.D. Yuschuk that a scheme was developed, and is now successfully used, for a continuous medical education when a higher medical is to be followed by postgraduate courses (internship, residency, specialization, retraining, and refresher). As to the university's new educational facilities that sprang into being in 2002, they include the faculty of Health Economics and Management (2004), the Moscow Region faculty (2005), and that of Penitentiary Medicine (2006).\n\nOn May 15, 2007, Professor O.O. Yanushevich, head of the MSMDU Periodontology and Geriatric Dentistry department, was elected rector in a ballot by a university staff meeting that was also unanimous in voting for the former rector, academician N.D. Yuschuk, as the University President.\n\nHimself a graduate of the MSUMD, the Rector elected worked for a number of years at the University's Hospital Oral Therapy Department. Today, he has over 50 scientific papers on topical periodontal problems to his credit.\n\n==Notable faculty==\n* Oleg Yanushevich, DDM - rector of MSUMD, professor, honored doctor of Russia.\n* [[Anatoly Sharpenak]] (1895 - 1969) - scholar and biochemist, Professor.
