It is a [[film adaptation]] of the 1975 novel ''[[Bid Time Return]]'' by [[Richard Matheson]], who also wrote the screenplay. The film stars [[Christopher Reeve]], [[Jane Seymour (actress)|Jane Seymour]], and [[Christopher Plummer]].\n\nReeve plays Richard Collier, a playwright who becomes obsessed with a photograph of a young woman at the [[Grand Hotel (Mackinac Island)|Grand Hotel]]. Through self-[[hypnosis]], he wishes himself back in time to the year 1912 to find love with actress Elise McKenna (portrayed by Seymour), but comes into conflict with Elise's manager, William Fawcett Robinson (portrayed by Plummer), who fears that romance will derail her career and resolves to stop him.\n\nThe film is known for its musical [[Film score|score]] composed by [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]]. The 18th variation of [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]]'s ''[[Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini]]'' also appears several times.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1972, [[college]] theatre student Richard Collier celebrates the debut of his new play. During the celebration, an elderly woman places a [[pocket watch]] in his hand and pleads, \"Come back to me.\" Richard does not recognize the woman, who returns to her own residence and dies in her sleep that same night.\n\nEight years later, Richard is a successful [[playwright]] living in [[Chicago]]. While struggling with [[writer's block]], he decides to take a break from writing and travels to the [[Grand Hotel (Mackinac Island)|Grand Hotel]] on [[Mackinac Island]]. While exploring the hotel's hall of history, he becomes enthralled with a vintage photograph of Elise McKenna, a beautiful and famous early-20th century stage actress. Upon further research, he discovers she is the same woman who gave him the pocket watch. Richard visits Laura Roberts, Elise\u2019s former housekeeper and companion. While there, he discovers a [[music box]] that plays the 18th variation of [[Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini]], his favorite musical piece. Among Elise's personal effects is a book on [[time travel]] written by his old college professor, Dr. Gerard Finney. Richard becomes obsessed with traveling back to 1912 and meeting Elise, whom he has fallen in love with.\n\nRichard seeks out Professor Finney, who believes he briefly time traveled through the power of self-suggestion. Finney warns Richard that such a process would leave one very weak physically, perhaps dangerously so. Richard is determined to try. Dressed in an early 20th-century suit, he removes all modern objects from his hotel room and attempts to will himself to 1912 using [[tape recorder|tape-recorded]] suggestions. The attempt fails because he lacks real conviction, but after finding a hotel guest book from 1912 containing his signature, Richard realizes he will eventually succeed.\n\nRichard [[Hypnosis|hypnotizes]] himself again, this allowing his absolute faith in his eventual success to serve as the engine that transports him back to 1912. Richard finds Elise walking by the lake. Upon meeting him she asks, \"Is it you?\" Her manager, William Fawcett Robinson, abruptly intervenes and sends Richard away. Although Elise is initially uninterested, Richard pursues her until she agrees to accompany him on a stroll the next morning. During a boat ride, Richard hums the theme from the 18th variation of opus 43, a tune Elise has never heard before as it has yet to be written. Richard asks what Elise meant by, \"Is it you?\" She reveals that Robinson has predicted she will meet a man who will change her life, and that she should be afraid. Richard shows Elise the pocket watch she will give him in 1972. \n\nRichard attends Elise's play where she gives an impromptu monologue dedicated to him. During the intermission, Elise poses formally for a photograph but seeing Richard, breaks into a radiant smile. It is the same image Richard saw 68 years later. Afterward, Richard receives an urgent message from Robinson requesting a meeting. Robinson wants Richard to leave Elise, saying it is for her own good. When Richard says he loves her, Robinson has him bound and locked inside the stables. Robinson then tells Elise that Richard has left, though she does not believe him and professes her love for Richard.\n\nRichard wakes the next morning and frees himself. The acting troupe has already left for [[Denver]], though Elise has returned to the hotel to find him. They go to her room and make love. They agree to marry and Elise promises to buy Richard a new suit, as his is about a decade out of style. Inside one of the suit pockets, Richard discovers a [[penny]] with a 1979 mint date. This modern item breaks the hypnotic suggestion, pulling Richard into the present as Elise screams in terror.\n\nRichard awakens back in 1980. His attempts to return to 1912 are unsuccessful. After wandering the hotel grounds despondently, he returns to his room and, physically weakened by the time travel and brokenhearted, dies in despair. His spirit is drawn into the [[Heaven|afterlife]], where he is reunited with Elise.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Cast and order per opening and closing tombstone credits -->\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n!

He is astonished by Richard's having cut himself shaving with a [[straight razor]].\n\nA then-unknown [[William H. Macy]] has a bit role as a critic in the 1972 scene before Elise hands the watch to Richard. \n\n[[George Wendt]] is credited as a student during this same scene, but his appearance was omitted from the final cut of the film. \n\nRichard Matheson's daughter, Ali, is similarly credited as a student.\n\nMany [[Mackinac Island]] residents were cast as extras.\n\n==Production notes==\n[[File:Grand Hotel 2008.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The Grand Hotel where the film was shot]]\n* The movie was filmed on location at the [[Grand Hotel (Mackinac Island)|Grand Hotel]], as well as the [[Mission Point (Mackinac Island)#Film Studio-Fine Arts building|Mission Point Fine Arts building]] of the former [[Mackinac College]] (now [[Mission Point Resort]]), both located on [[Mackinac Island, Michigan]]. Additional scenes were filmed in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]].\n* Bringing cars onto the island for use in the film required special permission from the [[Mackinac Island, Michigan|City of Mackinac Island]]. Motorized vehicles, other than emergency vehicles and snowmobiles in the winter, are prohibited on the Island. With very few exceptions, transportation is limited to horse and buggy or bicycle.\n* Director Jeannot Szwarc had a slight problem directing the scenes between Plummer and Reeve in that whenever he said \"Chris,\" both men would respond with \"Yes?\" Szwarc resolved this by addressing Plummer as \"Mr. Plummer\" and addressing Reeve as \"[[Bigfoot]]\".\n* The final scene between Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour before Reeve's character is thrown back into his own time was difficult for Reeve to shoot as he had just learned that his girlfriend and companion, Gae Exton, was pregnant with his first son Matthew. For much of that day his attention was understandably elsewhere. Reeve says on the bonus material of the 2000 DVD, \"The day we shot the picnic scene on the floor I found out, and the world found out, that I was about to be a father for the first time.\"\n* In the film, Reeve's character consults with a Dr. Finney (played by [[George Voskovec]]), a time travel theorist. This is a deliberate nod to author [[Jack Finney]], whose novel ''[[Time and Again (Finney novel)|Time and Again]]'', published five years before the 1975 [[Richard Matheson]] novel ''[[Bid Time Return]],'' on which this film is based, features an almost identical theory on the mechanics of time travel.\n* Elise McKenna was a fictional actress. Collier is filmed in the library searching and looking through an old theater album, which has photos of historic stage actresses. The three little girls are [[Blanche Ring]] and her sisters. A child holding a doll is actress [[Rose Stahl]]. A faded picture of a woman in [[nun's habit]] is [[Ethel Barrymore]] in a 1928 play, ''The Kingdom of God''. (Barrymore's head is left out of the frame as she would be readily recognizable by alert fans of old films.)<ref>Blum, Daniel. ''Great Stars of the American Stage'', c.1952. All of these photos are in Blum's book.</ref>\n* Elise McKenna's character was loosely based upon the life of theatre actress [[Maude Adams]], who was born Maude Ewing Adams Kiskadden in [[Salt Lake City]], Utah on November 11, 1872. She died in [[Tannersville, New York]] on July 17, 1953. Her manager, [[Charles Frohman]] (the basis for the William Fawcett Robinson character) was very protective of her. He died on the [[RMS Lusitania|RMS ''Lusitania'']] on May 7, 1915 when it was torpedoed by a German submarine during [[World War I]].<ref>{{Citation |last=Robbins |first=Phyllis |title=Maude Adams: An Intimate Portrait |publisher=G.P. Putnam's Sons |location=New York |year=1956 }}.</ref> \nAt two points in the movie Christopher Reeve is seen listening to the radio.  The first time is during a sequence in which Reeve is driving northbound on Lake Shore Drive in Chicago.   The second time is when Reeve returns to the present and turns on the radio in his room at the Grand Hotel in Mackinac.  In both instances the radio announcer is Reese Rickards;  A long time fixture at Chicago AM radio station [[WYLL#WJJD|WJJD]].   While the movie portrays the radio station as having a jazz format, Rickards plays an actual jingle from WJJD which was at the time, a country station.\n\n==Differences from the novel==\nIn the novel, Richard travels from 1971 to 1896 rather than from 1980 to 1912. The setting is the [[Hotel del Coronado]] in California, rather than the [[Grand Hotel (Mackinac Island)|Grand Hotel]] in Michigan. The book has Richard knowing that he is dying of a [[brain tumor]], and it ultimately raises the possibility that the whole time-traveling experience was merely a series of [[hallucination]]s brought on by the tumor. \n\nThe scene where the old woman hands Richard a pocket watch (which he had given to her in the past) does not appear in the book. Thus, the [[ontological paradox]] generated by this event (that the watch was never made, but simply exists eternally between 1912 and 1980) is absent. In the book, there are two [[psychic]]s, not William Fawcett Robinson, who anticipate Richard's appearance, and Richard's death is brought about by his tumor, not by heartbreak.\n\nAlso, in the film Elise witnesses Richard's return to his own time, while in the book she is asleep and does not.\n\n==Reception==\nAlthough the film was well received during its previews, it was derided by critics upon release and underperformed at the box office. In 2009, in an interview with [[WGN America]], Jane Seymour stated that, \"It was just a little movie... ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'' came out the same week and it was a $4 million budget, so Universal didn't really support it.

[[Jeannot Szwarc]]. It is a [[film adaptation]] of the 1975 novel ''[[Bid Time Return]]'' by [[Richard Matheson]], who also wrote the screenplay. The film stars [[Christopher Reeve]], [[Jane Seymour (actress)|Jane Seymour]], and [[Christopher Plummer]].\n\nReeve plays Richard Collier, a playwright who becomes obsessed with a photograph of a young woman at the [[Grand Hotel (Mackinac Island)|Grand Hotel]]. Through self-[[hypnosis]], he wishes himself back in time to the year 1912 to find love with actress Elise McKenna (portrayed by Seymour), but comes into conflict with Elise's manager, William Fawcett Robinson (portrayed by Plummer), who fears that romance will derail her career and resolves to stop him.\n\nThe film is known for its musical [[Film score|score]] composed by [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]]. The 18th variation of [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]]'s ''[[Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini]]'' also appears several times.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1972, [[college]] theatre student Richard Collier celebrates the debut of his new play. During the celebration, an elderly woman places a [[pocket watch]] in his hand and pleads, \"Come back to me.\" Richard does not recognize the woman, who returns to her own residence and dies in her sleep that same night.\n\nEight years later, Richard is a successful [[playwright]] living in [[Chicago]]. While struggling with [[writer's block]], he decides to take a break from writing and travels to the [[Grand Hotel (Mackinac Island)|Grand Hotel]] on [[Mackinac Island]]. While exploring the hotel's hall of history, he becomes enthralled with a vintage photograph of Elise McKenna, a beautiful and famous early-20th century stage actress. Upon further research, he discovers she is the same woman who gave him the pocket watch. Richard visits Laura Roberts, Elise\u2019s former housekeeper and companion. While there, he discovers a [[music box]] that plays the 18th variation of [[Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini]], his favorite musical piece. Among Elise's personal effects is a book on [[time travel]] written by his old college professor, Dr. Gerard Finney. Richard becomes obsessed with traveling back to 1912 and meeting Elise, whom he has fallen in love with.\n\nRichard seeks out Professor Finney, who believes he briefly time traveled through the power of self-suggestion. Finney warns Richard that such a process would leave one very weak physically, perhaps dangerously so. Richard is determined to try. Dressed in an early 20th-century suit, he removes all modern objects from his hotel room and attempts to will himself to 1912 using [[tape recorder|tape-recorded]] suggestions. The attempt fails because he lacks real conviction, but after finding a hotel guest book from 1912 containing his signature, Richard realizes he will eventually succeed.\n\nRichard [[Hypnosis|hypnotizes]] himself again, this allowing his absolute faith in his eventual success to serve as the engine that transports him back to 1912. Richard finds Elise walking by the lake. Upon meeting him she asks, \"Is it you?\" Her manager, William Fawcett Robinson, abruptly intervenes and sends Richard away. Although Elise is initially uninterested, Richard pursues her until she agrees to accompany him on a stroll the next morning. During a boat ride, Richard hums the theme from the 18th variation of opus 43, a tune Elise has never heard before as it has yet to be written. Richard asks what Elise meant by, \"Is it you?\" She reveals that Robinson has predicted she will meet a man who will change her life, and that she should be afraid. Richard shows Elise the pocket watch she will give him in 1972. \n\nRichard attends Elise's play where she gives an impromptu monologue dedicated to him. During the intermission, Elise poses formally for a photograph but seeing Richard, breaks into a radiant smile. It is the same image Richard saw 68 years later. Afterward, Richard receives an urgent message from Robinson requesting a meeting. Robinson wants Richard to leave Elise, saying it is for her own good. When Richard says he loves her, Robinson has him bound and locked inside the stables. Robinson then tells Elise that Richard has left, though she does not believe him and professes her love for Richard.\n\nRichard wakes the next morning and frees himself. The acting troupe has already left for [[Denver]], though Elise has returned to the hotel to find him. They go to her room and make love. They agree to marry and Elise promises to buy Richard a new suit, as his is about a decade out of style. Inside one of the suit pockets, Richard discovers a [[penny]] with a 1979 mint date. This modern item breaks the hypnotic suggestion, pulling Richard into the present as Elise screams in terror.\n\nRichard awakens back in 1980. His attempts to return to 1912 are unsuccessful. After wandering the hotel grounds despondently, he returns to his room and, physically weakened by the time travel and brokenhearted, dies in despair. His spirit is drawn into the [[Heaven|afterlife]], where he is reunited with Elise.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Cast and order per opening and closing tombstone credits -->\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n!

He is astonished by Richard's having cut himself shaving with a [[straight razor]].\n\nA then-unknown [[William H. Macy]] has a bit role as a critic in the 1972 scene before Elise hands the watch to Richard. \n\n[[George Wendt]] is credited as a student during this same scene, but his appearance was omitted from the final cut of the film. \n\nRichard Matheson's daughter, Ali, is similarly credited as a student.\n\nMany [[Mackinac Island]] residents were cast as extras.\n\n==Production notes==\n[[File:Grand Hotel 2008.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The Grand Hotel where the film was shot]]\n* The movie was filmed on location at the [[Grand Hotel (Mackinac Island)|Grand Hotel]], as well as the [[Mission Point (Mackinac Island)#Film Studio-Fine Arts building|Mission Point Fine Arts building]] of the former [[Mackinac College]] (now [[Mission Point Resort]]), both located on [[Mackinac Island, Michigan]]. Additional scenes were filmed in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]].\n* Bringing cars onto the island for use in the film required special permission from the [[Mackinac Island, Michigan|City of Mackinac Island]]. Motorized vehicles, other than emergency vehicles and snowmobiles in the winter, are prohibited on the Island. With very few exceptions, transportation is limited to horse and buggy or bicycle.\n* Director Jeannot Szwarc had a slight problem directing the scenes between Plummer and Reeve in that whenever he said \"Chris,\" both men would respond with \"Yes?\" Szwarc resolved this by addressing Plummer as \"Mr. Plummer\" and addressing Reeve as \"[[Bigfoot]]\".\n* The final scene between Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour before Reeve's character is thrown back into his own time was difficult for Reeve to shoot as he had just learned that his girlfriend and companion, Gae Exton, was pregnant with his first son Matthew. For much of that day his attention was understandably elsewhere. Reeve says on the bonus material of the 2000 DVD, \"The day we shot the picnic scene on the floor I found out, and the world found out, that I was about to be a father for the first time.\"\n* In the film, Reeve's character consults with a Dr. Finney (played by [[George Voskovec]]), a time travel theorist. This is a deliberate nod to author [[Jack Finney]], whose novel ''[[Time and Again (Finney novel)|Time and Again]]'', published five years before the 1975 [[Richard Matheson]] novel ''[[Bid Time Return]],'' on which this film is based, features an almost identical theory on the mechanics of time travel.\n* Elise McKenna was a fictional actress. Collier is filmed in the library searching and looking through an old theater album, which has photos of historic stage actresses. The three little girls are [[Blanche Ring]] and her sisters. A child holding a doll is actress [[Rose Stahl]]. A faded picture of a woman in [[nun's habit]] is [[Ethel Barrymore]] in a 1928 play, ''The Kingdom of God''. (Barrymore's head is left out of the frame as she would be readily recognizable by alert fans of old films.)<ref>Blum, Daniel. ''Great Stars of the American Stage'', c.1952. All of these photos are in Blum's book.</ref>\n* Elise McKenna's character was loosely based upon the life of theatre actress [[Maude Adams]], who was born Maude Ewing Adams Kiskadden in [[Salt Lake City]], Utah on November 11, 1872. She died in [[Tannersville, New York]] on July 17, 1953. Her manager, [[Charles Frohman]] (the basis for the William Fawcett Robinson character) was very protective of her. He died on the [[RMS Lusitania|RMS ''Lusitania'']] on May 7, 1915 when it was torpedoed by a German submarine during [[World War I]].<ref>{{Citation |last=Robbins |first=Phyllis |title=Maude Adams: An Intimate Portrait |publisher=G.P. Putnam's Sons |location=New York |year=1956 }}.</ref> \nAt two points in the movie Christopher Reeve is seen listening to the radio.  The first time is during a sequence in which Reeve is driving northbound on Lake Shore Drive in Chicago.   The second time is when Reeve returns to the present and turns on the radio in his room at the Grand Hotel in Mackinac.  In both instances the radio announcer is Reese Rickards;  A long time fixture at Chicago AM radio station [[WYLL#WJJD|WJJD]].   While the movie portrays the radio station as having a jazz format, Rickards plays an actual jingle from WJJD which was at the time, a country station.\n\n==Differences from the novel==\nIn the novel, Richard travels from 1971 to 1896 rather than from 1980 to 1912. The setting is the [[Hotel del Coronado]] in California, rather than the [[Grand Hotel (Mackinac Island)|Grand Hotel]] in Michigan. The book has Richard knowing that he is dying of a [[brain tumor]], and it ultimately raises the possibility that the whole time-traveling experience was merely a series of [[hallucination]]s brought on by the tumor. \n\nThe scene where the old woman hands Richard a pocket watch (which he had given to her in the past) does not appear in the book. Thus, the [[ontological paradox]] generated by this event (that the watch was never made, but simply exists eternally between 1912 and 1980) is absent. In the book, there are two [[psychic]]s, not William Fawcett Robinson, who anticipate Richard's appearance, and Richard's death is brought about by his tumor, not by heartbreak.\n\nAlso, in the film Elise witnesses Richard's return to his own time, while in the book she is asleep and does not.\n\n==Reception==\nAlthough the film was well received during its previews, it was derided by critics upon release and underperformed at the box office. In 2009, in an interview with [[WGN America]], Jane Seymour stated that, \"It was just a little movie... ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'' came out the same week and it was a $4 million budget, so Universal didn't really support it. There was also an actors' [[Strike action|strike]], so Chris [Reeve] and I weren't allowed to publicize it.

He is best known for developing the musical concept Fourth World, which describes a \"unified primitive/futurist sound\" combining elements of various [[world music|world ethnic]] traditions with modern [[electronic music|electronic]] techniques.<ref name=\"ankeny\" /> The concept was first articulated on ''[[Fourth World, Vol. 1: Possible Musics]]'', his 1980 collaboration with [[Brian Eno]]. He has also worked with artists such as the [[Theatre of Eternal Music]], [[Talking Heads]], [[Farafina]], [[Peter Gabriel]], [[Ani DiFranco]], [[Techno Animal]], and [[Ry Cooder]].<ref name=\"ankeny\" />\n\n==Life and career==\nBorn in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], United States,<ref name=\"ankeny\" /> Hassell received his [[master's degree]] from the [[Eastman School of Music]] in [[Rochester, New York]]. During this time he became involved in European [[Serialism|serial music]], especially the work of [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], and so after finishing his studies at Eastman, he enrolled in the Cologne Course for New Music (founded and directed by Stockhausen) for two years. Hassell returned to the U.S. in 1967, where he met [[Terry Riley]] in [[Buffalo, New York]] and performed on the first recording of Riley's seminal work ''[[In C]]'' in 1968. He pursued his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[musicology]] in Buffalo and performed in [[La Monte Young]]'s \"Dream House\" (a.k.a. [[Theatre of Eternal Music]]) in [[New York City]].\n\nOn his return to Buffalo in the early 1970s, Hassell was introduced to the music of Indian [[Pandit Pran Nath]], a specialist in the [[Kirana gharana|Kiranic]] style of singing. Hassell, Young, [[Marian Zazeela]], and Riley went together to India to study with Nath. His work with Nath awoke his appetite for traditional musics of the world, and on the album ''Vernal Equinox'', he used his trumpet (treated with various electronic effects) to imitate the vocal techniques to which Nath had exposed him. He stated:\n\n:\"From 1973 up until then I was totally immersed in playing raga on the trumpet. I wanted the physical dexterity to be able to come into a room and be able to do something that nobody else in the world could do. My aim was to make a music that was vertically integrated in such a way that at any cross-sectional moment you were not able to pick a single element out as being from a particular country or genre of music.\"<ref name=\"prendergast\">{{cite web |first=Mark J. |last=Prendergast |title=Sound on Sound |url=http://www.jonhassell.com/soundon.html |work=Jonhassell.com |accessdate=11 August 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn 1980, he collaborated with [[Brian Eno]] on the album ''[[Fourth World, Vol. 1: Possible Musics]]'' and appeared on the Eno-produced Talking Heads album ''Remain in Light''. Hassell's 1981 release, ''[[Dream Theory in Malaya]]'', led to a performance at the first [[World of Music, Arts and Dance]] (WOMAD) Festival, organized by [[Peter Gabriel]]. He performed and co-wrote tracks on [[David Sylvian]]'s first solo album ''[[Brilliant Trees]]'', and its instrumental follow-up ''Words with the Shaman''. In the late 1980s, Hassell contributed to Gabriel's ''[[Passion: Music for The Last Temptation of Christ]]'', the soundtrack album for [[Martin Scorsese]]'s film, ''[[The Last Temptation of Christ (film)|The Last Temptation of Christ]]''. Hassell and Pete Scaturro composed the electronic theme music for the television show ''[[The Practice]]''.\nIn 1989, Hassell contributed to the [[Tears for Fears]] album ''[[The Seeds of Love]]''.\n\n==Style==\n\nHassell coined the term \"Fourth World\" to describe his work on \"a unified primitive/futuristic sound combining features of world ethnic styles with advanced electronic techniques.\"<ref name=\"ankeny\" /> He uses extensive [[audio signal processing|electronic processing]] of his trumpet playing.<ref name=\"ankeny\" /> In addition to nonwestern traditional musics, critics have noted the influence of [[Miles Davis]] on Hassell's style, particularly Davis' use of electronics, [[Musical modes|modal]] [[harmony]], and understated lyricism.<ref>{{Cite web | first=Mark | last=Gilbert | title=Jon Hassell | url=http://www.grovemusic.com | work=Grove Music Online | editor=L.

He is best known for developing the musical concept Fourth World, which describes a \"unified primitive/futurist sound\" combining elements of various [[world music|world ethnic]] traditions with modern [[electronic music|electronic]] techniques.<ref name=\"ankeny\" /> The concept was first articulated on ''[[Fourth World, Vol. 1: Possible Musics]]'', his 1980 collaboration with [[Brian Eno]]. He has also worked with artists such as the [[Theatre of Eternal Music]], [[Talking Heads]], [[Farafina]], [[Peter Gabriel]], [[Ani DiFranco]], [[Techno Animal]], and [[Ry Cooder]].<ref name=\"ankeny\" />\n\n==Life and career==\nBorn in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], United States,<ref name=\"ankeny\" /> Hassell received his [[master's degree]] from the [[Eastman School of Music]] in [[Rochester, New York]]. During this time he became involved in European [[Serialism|serial music]], especially the work of [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], and so after finishing his studies at Eastman, he enrolled in the Cologne Course for New Music (founded and directed by Stockhausen) for two years. Hassell returned to the U.S. in 1967, where he met [[Terry Riley]] in [[Buffalo, New York]] and performed on the first recording of Riley's seminal work ''[[In C]]'' in 1968. He pursued his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[musicology]] in Buffalo and performed in [[La Monte Young]]'s \"Dream House\" (a.k.a. [[Theatre of Eternal Music]]) in [[New York City]].\n\nOn his return to Buffalo in the early 1970s, Hassell was introduced to the music of Indian [[Pandit Pran Nath]], a specialist in the [[Kirana gharana|Kiranic]] style of singing. Hassell, Young, [[Marian Zazeela]], and Riley went together to India to study with Nath. His work with Nath awoke his appetite for traditional musics of the world, and on the album ''Vernal Equinox'', he used his trumpet (treated with various electronic effects) to imitate the vocal techniques to which Nath had exposed him. He stated:\n\n:\"From 1973 up until then I was totally immersed in playing raga on the trumpet. I wanted the physical dexterity to be able to come into a room and be able to do something that nobody else in the world could do. My aim was to make a music that was vertically integrated in such a way that at any cross-sectional moment you were not able to pick a single element out as being from a particular country or genre of music.\"<ref name=\"prendergast\">{{cite web |first=Mark J. |last=Prendergast |title=Sound on Sound |url=http://www.jonhassell.com/soundon.html |work=Jonhassell.com |accessdate=11 August 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn 1980, he collaborated with [[Brian Eno]] on the album ''[[Fourth World, Vol. 1: Possible Musics]]'' and appeared on the Eno-produced Talking Heads album ''Remain in Light''. Hassell's 1981 release, ''[[Dream Theory in Malaya]]'', led to a performance at the first [[World of Music, Arts and Dance]] (WOMAD) Festival, organized by [[Peter Gabriel]]. He performed and co-wrote tracks on [[David Sylvian]]'s first solo album ''[[Brilliant Trees]]'', and its instrumental follow-up ''Words with the Shaman''. In the late 1980s, Hassell contributed to Gabriel's ''[[Passion: Music for The Last Temptation of Christ]]'', the soundtrack album for [[Martin Scorsese]]'s film, ''[[The Last Temptation of Christ (film)|The Last Temptation of Christ]]''. Hassell and Pete Scaturro composed the electronic theme music for the television show ''[[The Practice]]''.\nIn 1989, Hassell contributed to the [[Tears for Fears]] album ''[[The Seeds of Love]]''.\n\n==Style==\n\nHassell coined the term \"Fourth World\" to describe his work on \"a unified primitive/futuristic sound combining features of world ethnic styles with advanced electronic techniques.\"<ref name=\"ankeny\" /> He uses extensive [[audio signal processing|electronic processing]] of his trumpet playing.<ref name=\"ankeny\" /> In addition to nonwestern traditional musics, critics have noted the influence of [[Miles Davis]] on Hassell's style, particularly Davis' use of electronics, [[Musical modes|modal]] [[harmony]], and understated lyricism.<ref>{{Cite web | first=Mark | last=Gilbert | title=Jon Hassell | url=http://www.grovemusic.com | work=Grove Music Online | editor=L.

V-ATPases are multiprotein complexes composed of two functional domains, a V<small>0</small> domain, and a V<small>1</small> domain. The V<small>1</small> domain catalyzes the [[hydrolysis]] of ATP in order to power the pumping of protons through the V<small>0</small> channel, which spans the lipid bilayer of endosomal compartments.<ref name=\"Guillard, Mailys 1792\">Guillard, Mailys, et al. \"Vacuolar H+-ATPase meets glycosylation in patients with cutis laxa.\" Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA)-Molecular Basis of Disease 1792.9 (2009): 903-914.</ref> Vacuolar ATPases are also localized within the plasma membrane of both renal cells and osteoclasts.<ref name=\"Guillard, Mailys 1792\"/> In osteoclasts, V-ATPases are required for pumping protons onto the bone surface. The protons are then used for [[bone resorption]]. In renal cells, V-ATPases are used to pump protons into the urine. This facilitates bicarbonate reabsorption into the blood. The ''ATP6V0A2'' gene encodes the a2 [[isoform]] of the a-subunit (present in the V<small>0</small> domain).<ref name=\"Guillard, Mailys 1792\"/> The a2 subunit anchors the V-ATPase to the membrane, and it is also directly involved with proton transport.<ref name=\"doi.org\">Morava, E., Guillard, M., Lefeber, D. J., & Wevers, R. A. (2009). Autosomal recessive cutis laxa syndrome revisited. European journal of human genetics: EJHG, 17(9), 1099\u20131110. https://doi.org/10.1038/ejhg.2009.22</ref> ATP6V0A2 is encoded by the ''ATP6V0A2'' gene. The ATP6V0A2 pump is found in virtually all cells and is thought to play an important role in the process of vesicular fusion in the secretory pathway, including the secretion of [[extracellular matrix]] components.<ref name=\"Guillard, Mailys 1792\"/>\n\n=== The Function of the Golgi Apparatus in Protein Maturation ===\nThe most important subcellular structure in the context of wrinkly skin syndrome (WSS), is the [[Golgi apparatus]]. The Golgi apparatus is an important part of the endomembrane system because it processes proteins and lipids prior to their delivery to the plasma membrane and/or secretion into the extracellular environment. The Golgi is organized into a polarized series of membrane-bound stacks, called cisternae, through which proteins are trafficked in sequence once they leave the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] (ER), where the proteins and lipids are synthesized. Proteins destined for secretion or delivery to the plasma membrane arrive first at the cis-Golgi, before being trafficked through the medial and trans-Golgi.<ref name=\"Udono, Miyako 2015\">Udono, Miyako, et al. \"Impaired ATP6V0A2 expression contributes to Golgi dispersion and glycosylation changes in senescent cells.\" Scientific Reports 5 (2015): 17342.</ref> In the Golgi, proteins undergo extensive [[post-translational modifications]] (PTMs). In the context of WSS, the most significant  PTM events are the [[glycosylation]] of proteins comprising the extracellular matrix (ECM) of epidermal cells. The two types of glycosylation events in the Golgi are [[N-linked glycosylation]] and [[O-linked glycosylation]].<ref name=\"Rosnoblet, C. 2013\">Rosnoblet, C., Peanne, R., Legrand, D. et al. Glycosylation disorders of membrane trafficking. Glycoconj J 30, 23\u201331 (2013). https://doi.org/10.1007/s10719-012-9389-y</ref> Glycosylation of proteins destined for secretion occurs through the forward movement of proteins throughout the Golgi apparatus.

V-ATPases are multiprotein complexes composed of two functional domains, a V<small>0</small> domain, and a V<small>1</small> domain. The V<small>1</small> domain catalyzes the [[hydrolysis]] of ATP in order to power the pumping of protons through the V<small>0</small> channel, which spans the lipid bilayer of endosomal compartments.<ref name=\"Guillard, Mailys 1792\">Guillard, Mailys, et al. \"Vacuolar H+-ATPase meets glycosylation in patients with cutis laxa.\" Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA)-Molecular Basis of Disease 1792.9 (2009): 903-914.</ref> Vacuolar ATPases are also localized within the plasma membrane of both renal cells and osteoclasts.<ref name=\"Guillard, Mailys 1792\"/> In osteoclasts, V-ATPases are required for pumping protons onto the bone surface. The protons are then used for [[bone resorption]]. In renal cells, V-ATPases are used to pump protons into the urine. This facilitates bicarbonate reabsorption into the blood. The ''ATP6V0A2'' gene encodes the a2 [[isoform]] of the a-subunit (present in the V<small>0</small> domain).<ref name=\"Guillard, Mailys 1792\"/> The a2 subunit anchors the V-ATPase to the membrane, and it is also directly involved with proton transport.<ref name=\"doi.org\">Morava, E., Guillard, M., Lefeber, D.

The ATP6V0A2 pump is found in virtually all cells and is thought to play an important role in the process of vesicular fusion in the secretory pathway, including the secretion of [[extracellular matrix]] components.<ref name=\"Guillard, Mailys 1792\"/>\n\n=== The Function of the Golgi Apparatus in Protein Maturation ===\nThe most important subcellular structure in the context of wrinkly skin syndrome (WSS), is the [[Golgi apparatus]]. The Golgi apparatus is an important part of the endomembrane system because it processes proteins and lipids prior to their delivery to the plasma membrane and/or secretion into the extracellular environment. The Golgi is organized into a polarized series of membrane-bound stacks, called cisternae, through which proteins are trafficked in sequence once they leave the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] (ER), where the proteins and lipids are synthesized. Proteins destined for secretion or delivery to the plasma membrane arrive first at the cis-Golgi, before being trafficked through the medial and trans-Golgi.<ref name=\"Udono, Miyako 2015\">Udono, Miyako, et al. \"Impaired ATP6V0A2 expression contributes to Golgi dispersion and glycosylation changes in senescent cells.\" Scientific Reports 5 (2015): 17342.</ref> In the Golgi, proteins undergo extensive [[post-translational modifications]] (PTMs). In the context of WSS, the most significant  PTM events are the [[glycosylation]] of proteins comprising the extracellular matrix (ECM) of epidermal cells. The two types of glycosylation events in the Golgi are [[N-linked glycosylation]] and [[O-linked glycosylation]].<ref name=\"Rosnoblet, C. 2013\">Rosnoblet, C., Peanne, R., Legrand, D. et al.

This formalized protocol included a provision that henceforth [[academic procession]]s would place visiting dignitaries and other officials in the order of their institution's founding dates. The following year, Penn's ''The Alumni Register'' magazine, published by the General Alumni Society, began a campaign to retroactively revise the University's founding date to 1740, to become older than Princeton, which had been chartered in 1746. Three years later in 1899, Penn's board of trustees acceded to this alumni initiative and officially changed its founding date from 1749 to 1740, affecting its rank in academic processions as well as the informal bragging rights that come with the age-based hierarchy in academia generally.

Other American universities that began as a colonial-era, early version of secondary schools such as [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]] (founded as \"King William's School\" in 1696) and the [[University of Delaware]] (founded as \"the Free Academy\" in 1743) choose to march based upon the date they became institutions of higher learning.  Penn History Professor Edgar Potts Cheyney was a member of the Penn class of 1883 who played a leading role in the 1896-1899 alumni campaign to change the university's formal founding date.  According to Cheyney's later history of the event, the university did indeed consider its founding date to be 1749 for almost a century. However, it was changed with good reason, and primarily due to a publication about the university issued by the [[United States Secretary of Education|U.S. Commissioner of Education]] written by Francis Newton Thorpe, a fellow alumnus, and colleague in the Penn history department. The year 1740 is the date of the establishment of the first educational trust that the University had taken upon itself. Cheyney states further that \"it might be considered a lawyer's date; it is a familiar legal practice in considering the date of any institution to seek out the oldest trust it administers\". He also points out that Harvard's founding date is also the year in which the [[Massachusetts General Court]] (state legislature) resolved to establish a fund in a year's time for a \"School or College\". As well, Princeton claims its founding date as 1746, the date of its first charter. However, the exact words of the charter are unknown, the number and names of the trustees in the charter are unknown, and no known original is extant. Except for Columbia University, the majority of the American Colonial Colleges do not have clear-cut dates of foundation <ref>Edgar Potts Cheyney, \"History of the University of Pennsylvania: 1740-1940\", Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1940: pp. 45-52.</ref>}}  The university also considers itself as the [[first university in the United States]] with both undergraduate and graduate studies.\n\n[[File:Benjamin Franklin statue in front of College Hall.JPG|thumb|right|This statue of [[Benjamin Franklin]] donated by Justus C.

At the first meeting of the 24 members of the Board of Trustees (November 13, 1749), the issue of where to locate the school was a prime concern. Although a lot across Sixth Street from the old Pennsylvania State House (later renamed and famously known since 1776 as \"[[Independence Hall (United States)|Independence Hall]]\"), was offered without cost by [[James Logan (statesman)|James Logan]], its owner, the Trustees realized that the building erected in 1740, which was still vacant, would be an even better site. The original sponsors of the dormant building still owed considerable construction debts and asked Franklin's group to assume their debts and, accordingly, their inactive trusts. On February 1, 1750, the new board took over the building and trusts of the old board. On August 13, 1751, the \"Academy of Philadelphia\", using the great hall at 4th and Arch Streets, took in its first secondary students.

Unlike CDD programs, \"dual degree\" students fulfill requirements of both programs independently without the involvement of another program. Specialized dual-degree programs include Liberal Studies and Technology as well as an Artificial Intelligence: Computer and Cognitive Science Program. Both programs award a degree from the College of Arts and Sciences and a degree from the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Also, the [[Vagelos Scholars Program in Molecular Life Sciences]] allows its students to either double major in the sciences or submatriculate and earn both a B.A. and an M.S. in four years. The most recent Vagelos Integrated Program in Energy Research (VIPER) was first offered for the class of 2016. A joint program of Penn's School of Arts and Sciences and the School of Engineering and Applied Science, VIPER leads to dual Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science in Engineering degrees by combining majors from each school.\n\nFor graduate programs, Penn offers many formalized [[double degree]] graduate degrees such as a joint J.D./MBA and maintains a list of interdisciplinary institutions, such as the Institute for Medicine and Engineering, the Joseph H. Lauder Institute for Management and International Studies, and the Institute for Research in Cognitive Science.\n\n===Academic medical center and biomedical research complex===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2020}}\n{{multiple image\n|footer=\n|align=left\n|image1=Hamilton Walk at the Perelman School of Medicine.jpg\n|width1={{#expr: (150 * 1331/881) round 0}}\n|alt1=Hamilton Walk and the John Morgan Building at the Perelman School of Medicine\n|caption1=[[Perelman School of Medicine]]\n|image2=PennDentalSchool.jpg\n|width2={{#expr: (150 * 2039/1138) round 0}}\n|alt2=University of Pennsylvania Dental School\n|caption2=[[University of Pennsylvania School of Dental Medicine]]\n}}\nIn 2018, the University's Nursing school was ranked number one by [[Quacquarelli Symonds]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thedp.com/article/2018/03/penn-upenn-nursing-ranking-top-qs-world-global-ivy-satisfaction-league-philadelphia|title=Penn Nursing ranked top in the world, but receives mediocre score for 'employer reputation'|last=Chin|first=Zachary|website=www.thedp.com|language=en-us|access-date=2020-02-25}}</ref> That year, Quacquarelli Symonds also ranked Penn's school of Veterinary Medicine sixth.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2018/feb/28/qs-world-university-rankings-2018-veterinary-science|title=QS world university rankings 2018: veterinary science|date=2018-02-28|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-02-25|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\nIn 2019, the Perelman School of Medicine was named the third best medical school for research in U.S. News & World Report's 2020 ranking.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thedp.com/article/2019/03/perelman-school-of-medicine-ranking-us-news-third-place-penn|title=Perelman School of Medicine ranked third place for research in U.S. News report|last=Hachenburg|first=Carmina|website=www.thedp.com|language=en-us|access-date=2020-02-25}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the size of Penn's biomedical research organization adds a very capital intensive component to the university's operations and introduces revenue instability due to changing government regulations, reduced federal funding for research, and [[Medicare and Medicaid]] program changes. This is a primary reason highlighted in bond rating agencies' views on Penn's overall financial rating, which ranks one notch below its academic peers. Penn has worked to address these issues by pooling its schools (as well as several hospitals and clinical practices) into the [[University of Pennsylvania Health System]], thereby pooling resources for greater efficiencies and research impact.\n\n===Admissions selectivity===\nThe ''[[Princeton Review]]'' ranks Penn as the 6th most selective school in the United States.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.mycollegeplanning.com/images/pdfs/The%20Ten%20Toughest%20Schools%20to%20Get%20Into%5B1%5D.pdf|title=The Ten Toughest Schools to Get Into|publisher=My College Planning LLC|accessdate=July 31, 2011|archivedate=April 26, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426041205/http://www.mycollegeplanning.com/images/pdfs/The%20Ten%20Toughest%20Schools%20to%20Get%20Into%5B1%5D.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref> For the Class of 2024, entering in the fall of 2020,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thedp.com/article/2019/03/penn-acceptance-ivy-league-regular-decision-admissions-class-2023|title=Penn admits a record-low 7.44 percent of applicants to the Class of 2023|last=Diebold|first=Gillian|website=www.thedp.com|access-date=2019-03-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190328223429/https://www.thedp.com/article/2019/03/penn-acceptance-ivy-league-regular-decision-admissions-class-2023|archive-date=March 28, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> the University received 42,205 applications and admitted 8.07 percent of the applicants.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thedp.com/article/2020/03/penn-acceptance-ivy-league-regular-decision-admissions-class-2024|title=Penn admits 8.07% of applicants to the Class of 2024, a slight uptick from last year|last=Singh|first=Pia|website=www.thedp.com|language=en-us|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> ''[[The Atlantic]]'' also ranked Penn among the 10 most selective schools in the country.

In 1894, 1895, 1897 and 1904, Penn was generally regarded as the national champion of collegiate football.<ref name=\"Fight song\" /> The achievements of two of Penn's outstanding players from that era\u2014[[John Heisman]] and [[John Outland]]\u2014are remembered each year with the presentation of the [[Heisman Trophy]] to the most outstanding college football player of the year, and the [[Outland Trophy]] to the most outstanding college football [[Lineman (gridiron football)|interior lineman]] of the year.\n\nAlso, each year the [[Bednarik Award]] is given to college football's best defensive player. [[Chuck Bednarik]] (Class of 1949) was a three-time [[All-America]]n [[Center (American football)|center]]/[[linebacker]] who starred on the 1947 team and is generally regarded as Penn's all-time finest. In addition to Bednarik, the 1947 squad boasted four-time All-American [[Offensive tackle|tackle]] [[George Savitsky]] and three-time All-American [[Halfback (American football)|halfback]] [[Skip Minisi]]. All three standouts were subsequently elected to the [[College Football Hall of Fame]], as was their coach, [[George Munger (American football)|George Munger]] (a star running back at Penn in the early 1930s). Bednarik went on to play for 12 years with the [[Philadelphia Eagles]], becoming the [[National Football League|NFL's]] last 60-minute man. He was elected to the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in 1969. During his presidency of the institution from 1948 to 1953, [[Harold Stassen]] attempted to recultivate Penn's heyday of big-time [[college football]], but the effort lacked support and was short-lived.\n\n[[ESPN]]'s ''[[College GameDay (football)|College GameDay]]'' traveled to Penn to highlight the [[Harvard University|Harvard]]-Penn game on November 17, 2002, the first time the popular college football show had visited an Ivy League campus.\n\n===Basketball===\n[[File:The Palestra.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Palestra]], \"Cathedral of Basketball\"]]\n{{Main|Penn Quakers men's basketball}}\nPenn [[basketball]] is steeped in tradition. Penn made its only (and the Ivy League's second) [[Final Four]] appearance in 1979, where the Quakers lost to [[Magic Johnson]]-led [[Michigan State Spartans|Michigan State]] in Salt Lake City. (Dartmouth twice finished second in the tournament in the 1940s, but that was before the beginning of formal League play.) Penn's team is also a member of the [[Philadelphia Big 5]], along with [[La Salle University|La Salle]], [[Saint Joseph's University|Saint Joseph's]], [[Temple University|Temple]] and [[Villanova University|Villanova]]. In 2007, the men's team won its third consecutive Ivy League title and then lost in the first round of the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]] to [[Texas A&M Aggies|Texas A&M]].\n\n===Facilities===\n[[Franklin Field]] is where the Quakers play football, [[field hockey]], [[lacrosse]], [[sprint football]] and track and field (and formerly soccer). It is the oldest stadium still operating for football games and was the first stadium to sport two tiers. It hosted the first commercially televised football game, was once the home field of the Philadelphia Eagles, and was the site of 18 [[Army\u2013Navy Game|Army\u2013Navy]] games between 1899 and 1935.<ref>Didinger, Ray; Lyons, Robert S. (2005). ''The Eagles Encyclopedia''. Philadelphia: Temple University Press. p.&nbsp;205. {{ISBN|1-59213-449-1}}. Retrieved 2009-01-08</ref>\n\nToday it is also used by Penn students for recreation such as [[intramural sports|intramural]] and club sports, including [[Touch football (American)|touch football]] and cricket. Franklin Field hosts the annual collegiate track and field event \"the [[Penn Relays]].\"\n\nPenn's home court, the [[Palestra]], is an arena used for men's and women's basketball teams, volleyball teams, [[wrestling]] team and [[Philadelphia Big 5|Philadelphia Big Five basketball]], as well as high school sporting events. The Palestra has hosted more NCAA Tournament basketball games than any other facility. Penn baseball plays its home games at [[Meiklejohn Stadium]].\n\nThe [[1980 Olympic boycott|Olympic Boycott Games]] of 1980 was held at the University of Pennsylvania in response to Moscow's hosting of the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] following the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|Soviet incursion in Afghanistan]]. Twenty-nine of the boycotting nations participated in the Boycott Games.\n\n==Notable people==\n{{Main|List of University of Pennsylvania people}}\n{{See also|List of Nobel laureates affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania}}<!-- NOTICE * * * NOTICE * * * NOTICE * * * * * * * * * * * *NOTICE * * * NOTICE * * * NOTICE\nOnly people who already have a Wikipedia article may appear here as notable people.

The College of Philadelphia (later Penn), [[Princeton University|College of New Jersey (later Princeton University)]] and [[Columbia University|King's College (later Columbia College, now Columbia University)]] all originated within a few years of each other. After initially designating 1750 as its founding date, Penn later considered 1749 to be its founding date for more than a century, including alumni observing a centennial celebration in 1849. In 1895, several elite universities in the United States convened in New York City as the \"Intercollegiate Commission\" at the invitation of [[John James McCook (lawyer)|John J. McCook]], a [[Union Army]] officer during the [[American Civil War]] and member of Princeton's board of trustees who chaired its Committee on Academic Dress. The primary purpose of the conference was to standardize American academic regalia, which was accomplished through the adoption of the [[Academic regalia in the United States|Intercollegiate Code on Academic Costume]]. This formalized protocol included a provision that henceforth [[academic procession]]s would place visiting dignitaries and other officials in the order of their institution's founding dates. The following year, Penn's ''The Alumni Register'' magazine, published by the General Alumni Society, began a campaign to retroactively revise the University's founding date to 1740, to become older than Princeton, which had been chartered in 1746. Three years later in 1899, Penn's board of trustees acceded to this alumni initiative and officially changed its founding date from 1749 to 1740, affecting its rank in academic processions as well as the informal bragging rights that come with the age-based hierarchy in academia generally.

Other American universities that began as a colonial-era, early version of secondary schools such as [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]] (founded as \"King William's School\" in 1696) and the [[University of Delaware]] (founded as \"the Free Academy\" in 1743) choose to march based upon the date they became institutions of higher learning.  Penn History Professor Edgar Potts Cheyney was a member of the Penn class of 1883 who played a leading role in the 1896-1899 alumni campaign to change the university's formal founding date.  According to Cheyney's later history of the event, the university did indeed consider its founding date to be 1749 for almost a century. However, it was changed with good reason, and primarily due to a publication about the university issued by the [[United States Secretary of Education|U.S. Commissioner of Education]] written by Francis Newton Thorpe, a fellow alumnus, and colleague in the Penn history department. The year 1740 is the date of the establishment of the first educational trust that the University had taken upon itself. Cheyney states further that \"it might be considered a lawyer's date; it is a familiar legal practice in considering the date of any institution to seek out the oldest trust it administers\". He also points out that Harvard's founding date is also the year in which the [[Massachusetts General Court]] (state legislature) resolved to establish a fund in a year's time for a \"School or College\". As well, Princeton claims its founding date as 1746, the date of its first charter. However, the exact words of the charter are unknown, the number and names of the trustees in the charter are unknown, and no known original is extant. Except for Columbia University, the majority of the American Colonial Colleges do not have clear-cut dates of foundation <ref>Edgar Potts Cheyney, \"History of the University of Pennsylvania: 1740-1940\", Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1940: pp. 45-52.</ref>}}  The university also considers itself as the [[first university in the United States]] with both undergraduate and graduate studies.\n\n[[File:Benjamin Franklin statue in front of College Hall.JPG|thumb|right|This statue of [[Benjamin Franklin]] donated by Justus C.

At the first meeting of the 24 members of the Board of Trustees (November 13, 1749), the issue of where to locate the school was a prime concern. Although a lot across Sixth Street from the old Pennsylvania State House (later renamed and famously known since 1776 as \"[[Independence Hall (United States)|Independence Hall]]\"), was offered without cost by [[James Logan (statesman)|James Logan]], its owner, the Trustees realized that the building erected in 1740, which was still vacant, would be an even better site. The original sponsors of the dormant building still owed considerable construction debts and asked Franklin's group to assume their debts and, accordingly, their inactive trusts. On February 1, 1750, the new board took over the building and trusts of the old board.

Other schools with undergraduate programs include the [[University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing|School of Nursing]] and the [[University of Pennsylvania School of Engineering and Applied Science|School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS)]].\n\nPenn has a strong focus on interdisciplinary learning and research. It offers double degree programs, unique majors, and academic flexibility.

Unlike CDD programs, \"dual degree\" students fulfill requirements of both programs independently without the involvement of another program. Specialized dual-degree programs include Liberal Studies and Technology as well as an Artificial Intelligence: Computer and Cognitive Science Program. Both programs award a degree from the College of Arts and Sciences and a degree from the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Also, the [[Vagelos Scholars Program in Molecular Life Sciences]] allows its students to either double major in the sciences or submatriculate and earn both a B.A. and an M.S. in four years. The most recent Vagelos Integrated Program in Energy Research (VIPER) was first offered for the class of 2016. A joint program of Penn's School of Arts and Sciences and the School of Engineering and Applied Science, VIPER leads to dual Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science in Engineering degrees by combining majors from each school.\n\nFor graduate programs, Penn offers many formalized [[double degree]] graduate degrees such as a joint J.D./MBA and maintains a list of interdisciplinary institutions, such as the Institute for Medicine and Engineering, the Joseph H.

Following the First World War, cricket began to experience a serious decline as baseball became the preferred sport of the warmer months, but to this day the University still fields a cricket team.\n\n===Football===\n{{Main|Penn Quakers football}}\n[[File:FranklinFieldPenn.jpg|thumb|right|[[Franklin Field]], home to football, field hockey, lacrosse and track and field]]\nPenn first fielded a [[American football|football]] team against [[Princeton University|Princeton]] at the [[Germantown Cricket Club]] in Philadelphia on November 11, 1876.<ref name=\"Fight song\">[[Rottenberg, Dan]] (1985) \"Fight On, Pennsylvania\" Trustees of University of Pennsylvania pg. 25, 28, 33, 34.</ref>\n\nPenn football made many contributions to the sport in its early days. During the 1890s, Penn's famed coach and alumnus [[George Washington Woodruff]] introduced the quarterback kick, a forerunner of the [[forward pass]], as well as the [[Placekicker|place-kick]] from scrimmage and the delayed pass. In 1894, 1895, 1897 and 1904, Penn was generally regarded as the national champion of collegiate football.<ref name=\"Fight song\" /> The achievements of two of Penn's outstanding players from that era\u2014[[John Heisman]] and [[John Outland]]\u2014are remembered each year with the presentation of the [[Heisman Trophy]] to the most outstanding college football player of the year, and the [[Outland Trophy]] to the most outstanding college football [[Lineman (gridiron football)|interior lineman]] of the year.\n\nAlso, each year the [[Bednarik Award]] is given to college football's best defensive player. [[Chuck Bednarik]] (Class of 1949) was a three-time [[All-America]]n [[Center (American football)|center]]/[[linebacker]] who starred on the 1947 team and is generally regarded as Penn's all-time finest. In addition to Bednarik, the 1947 squad boasted four-time All-American [[Offensive tackle|tackle]] [[George Savitsky]] and three-time All-American [[Halfback (American football)|halfback]] [[Skip Minisi]]. All three standouts were subsequently elected to the [[College Football Hall of Fame]], as was their coach, [[George Munger (American football)|George Munger]] (a star running back at Penn in the early 1930s). Bednarik went on to play for 12 years with the [[Philadelphia Eagles]], becoming the [[National Football League|NFL's]] last 60-minute man. He was elected to the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in 1969. During his presidency of the institution from 1948 to 1953, [[Harold Stassen]] attempted to recultivate Penn's heyday of big-time [[college football]], but the effort lacked support and was short-lived.\n\n[[ESPN]]'s ''[[College GameDay (football)|College GameDay]]'' traveled to Penn to highlight the [[Harvard University|Harvard]]-Penn game on November 17, 2002, the first time the popular college football show had visited an Ivy League campus.\n\n===Basketball===\n[[File:The Palestra.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Palestra]], \"Cathedral of Basketball\"]]\n{{Main|Penn Quakers men's basketball}}\nPenn [[basketball]] is steeped in tradition. Penn made its only (and the Ivy League's second) [[Final Four]] appearance in 1979, where the Quakers lost to [[Magic Johnson]]-led [[Michigan State Spartans|Michigan State]] in Salt Lake City. (Dartmouth twice finished second in the tournament in the 1940s, but that was before the beginning of formal League play.) Penn's team is also a member of the [[Philadelphia Big 5]], along with [[La Salle University|La Salle]], [[Saint Joseph's University|Saint Joseph's]], [[Temple University|Temple]] and [[Villanova University|Villanova]]. In 2007, the men's team won its third consecutive Ivy League title and then lost in the first round of the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]] to [[Texas A&M Aggies|Texas A&M]].\n\n===Facilities===\n[[Franklin Field]] is where the Quakers play football, [[field hockey]], [[lacrosse]], [[sprint football]] and track and field (and formerly soccer). It is the oldest stadium still operating for football games and was the first stadium to sport two tiers. It hosted the first commercially televised football game, was once the home field of the Philadelphia Eagles, and was the site of 18 [[Army\u2013Navy Game|Army\u2013Navy]] games between 1899 and 1935.<ref>Didinger, Ray; Lyons, Robert S.

It was released on 13 December 2006 and came in both a [[Single (music)|single]] and a limited [[Extended play|EP]] version. \n\nThe song does not feature In Flames' iconic [[melodic death metal]] sound, instead having a more traditional [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] sound, influenced by bands like [[Iron Maiden]] and [[Black Sabbath]].  \n\n== Release ==\nThe CD single release only contains the title track itself and its video version.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/de/In-Flames-Come-Clarity/release/4473475|title=In Flames - Come Clarity|last=|first=|date=|website=Discogs|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref> A limited edition [[Phonograph record|vinyl]] version was also released (officially as an EP), and features \"Come Clarity\" as well as the song \"Only for the Weak\", taken from the 2000 album ''[[Clayman]]''.

After 20 seconds, the submarine descended under the surface again, with her bows at an angle of 50 degrees, and several more depth charges were dropped, bringing up oil and bubbles. The next day, the wreck, which had been located by sweeps, was plastered with depth charges in order to break it up to confirm that the submarine had being sunk.
