Both songs incorporated electronic elements, yet retained the [[hard rock]] elements of the band's previous material; one reviewer called the two singles \"balls-out, full-energy chargers\" and wrote off the Pumpkins' previous remarks that the upcoming album would \"rock\" less.<ref name=\"pfork\" /> However, the new album material Corgan was writing consisted mainly of simple acoustic songs.<ref name=\"corgan a\"/> Corgan, [[James Iha]], [[D'arcy Wretzky]], and [[Matt Walker (drummer)|Matt Walker]] spent a few days in the studio in February 1997 laying down demos mostly as live takes, and the band hoped to quickly record an entire album in such a manner.<ref name=\"corgan a\"/> Corgan, hoping to maintain the band's [[progressive rock]]-inspired experimentation, soon had second thoughts about this approach and began envisioning a hybrid of [[folk rock]] and electronica that was at once \"ancient\" and \"futuristic\".<ref name=\"corgan a\"/>\n\n== Recording ==\nThe Smashing Pumpkins started demoing in February 1997 and recorded 30 songs for the album which, at one point, looked set to be a double album.

I remember Kenny saying, 'I feel like I'm tripping on LSD' because he kept hearing things that were not in time, and it drove him crazy,\" said Corgan in the ''Adore'' reissue liner notes. Performing with Garson was also challenging because, according to Corgan, \"he made a decision 40 years ago that he would live in the intuitive flow of what he was feeling, so he literally cannot play the same thing twice. So we'd have gigs where he'd have that same magic as on ''[[Aladdin Sane]]'' and the next night he'd come and play the extreme opposite style\u2014like [[honkytonk]].

I remember Kenny saying, 'I feel like I'm tripping on LSD' because he kept hearing things that were not in time, and it drove him crazy,\" said Corgan in the ''Adore'' reissue liner notes. Performing with Garson was also challenging because, according to Corgan, \"he made a decision 40 years ago that he would live in the intuitive flow of what he was feeling, so he literally cannot play the same thing twice. So we'd have gigs where he'd have that same magic as on ''[[Aladdin Sane]]'' and the next night he'd come and play the extreme opposite style\u2014like [[honkytonk]].

Their numbers began to grow under the supervision of the [[Dominican order|Dominican]]s, which also helped create a more uniform format for the Rosary. An important Apostolic Constitution on the Rosary Confraternity was issued by [[Pope Leo XIII]] in 1898.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13188b.htm Thurston, Herbert. \"Confraternity of the Holy Rosary.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 13. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 22 Dec. 2014]</ref>\n\nThe approval of the \"Confraternity of the Scapular\" for every diocese helped the spread of that devotion, reaching its culmination in 1726 via the extension of the [[Feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel]] (July 16) to the universal Church.<ref>Lea, Henry Charles.

''Catholic Revival in the Age of the Baroque'', 2001, Cambridge Univ Press {{ISBN|0-521-78044-6}} page 145</ref>\n\n===Marian apparitions===\nIn the 19th century, the reported [[Marian apparition]]s of [[Our Lady of Lourdes]] gathered significant attention, and provided momentum for the spread of the Rosary. The spread of the devotion to both the Rosary and the Scapular was influenced by [[Marian apparition]]s of [[Our Lady of F\u00e1tima]] reported by three Portuguese children in 1917.<ref>[http://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/tsfatima.htm de Marchi, John. ''The True Story of Fatima'', Catechetical Guild Educational Society, St. Paul, Minnesota, 1952]</ref> The Fatima messages placed a strong emphasis on the Rosary and in them the Virgin Mary reportedly identified herself as ''The Lady of the Rosary''.<ref>Bunson, Matthew. ''Encyclopedia of Catholic History'', OSV Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-1-59276-026-8}} p. 348</ref> The visions and messages also encouraged the wearing of the Brown Scapular. In the final F\u00e1tima appearance on October 13, 1917 the Virgin Mary had a brown [[scapular]] in one hand and a [[rosary]] in the other.<ref>Santos, Lucia. ''Fatima in Lucia's Own Words'', Ravengate Press, 1976, {{ISBN|0-911218-10-6}}</ref>\n\n===Associations===\nThe 20th century witnessed the development of a number of Marian organizations. The [[Blue Army of Our Lady of Fatima]] was formed in 1946 in the United States and through \"Scapular Magazine\" helped enroll one million Americans to pray the Rosary based on the F\u00e1tima messages regarding the [[Consecration of Russia]]. The Blue Army eventually reached a larger audience of several million members.<ref>Stravinskas, Peter.

But in his analysis the re-Christianisation was not possible without Mary. So Leo XIII promoted Marian devotion via ten encyclicals on the Rosary and instituted the Catholic custom of daily rosary prayer during the month of October.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/leo_xiii/encyclicals/documents/hf_l-xiii_enc_01091883_supremi-apostolatus-officio_en.html Vatican website: ''Supremi apostolatus officio'']</ref><ref>[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/leo_xiii/encyclicals/documents/hf_l-xiii_enc_22091891_octobri-mense_en.html Vatican website: ''Octobri mense'']</ref>In 1883 he also created the Feast of ''Queen of the Holy Rosary''.<ref>Remigius Baumer, 1988, ''Marienlexikon'', St. Ottilien, pp.41</ref>\n\n[[Pope John Paul II]] stated that: \"Scapular is essentially a habit which evokes the protection of the Blessed Virgin Mary in this life and in the passage to the fullness of eternal glory.\"<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/audiences/2001/documents/hf_jp-ii_aud_20010912_en.html  Vatican website, General Audiences]</ref> [[Pope John Paul II]] further stated that he received his own first [[Brown Scapular of Mount Carmel]] at age ten when his Marian devotion was taking shape and he continued to wear it into his papacy.

St. [[Alphonsus Liguori]] of the [[Redemptorists]] and St. [[John Bosco]] of the [[Salesians]] had a very special devotion to [[Our Lady of Mount Carmel]], and were both buried wearing their Brown Scapulars. St. John Bosco's Brown Scapular was later exhumed in very good condition and is kept as a relic at the [[Basilica of Our Lady Help of Christians, Turin]].<ref>Joan Carroll Cruz, 1984, ''Relics'', OSV Press {{ISBN|978-0-87973-701-6}} page 162</ref>\n\nSaint [[Claude de la Colombi\u00e8re]], the confessor of Saint [[Margaret-Marie Alacoque]], had a strong devotion to the [[Brown Scapular]] and considered it one of the most favorite and effective Marian devotions. He also stated that: \"If a person wants to die in his sins, he will die in his sins, but he will not die wearing the Brown Scapular\".<ref>Claude de la Colombi\u00e8re, 1997, ''Spiritual Direction of St. Claude de la Columbiere'', Ignatius Press {{ISBN|978-0-89870-682-6}}</ref> \n\nSt. [[Louis de Montfort]] is widely known for his promotion of the Rosary.

[[Pope Pius XII]] said of the Brown Scapular: \"Let it be your sign of consecration to the [[Immaculate Heart of Mary]]\".<ref>Robert Fox, 2004, ''Prayer Book for Young Catholics'', OSV Press {{ISBN|978-1-59276-098-5}} page 135</ref> And in his encyclical [[Ingruentium Malorum]] on the Rosary Pius XII stated: \"And truly, from the frequent meditation on the Mysteries, the soul little by little and imperceptibly draws and absorbs the virtues they contain, and is wondrously enkindled with a longing for things immortal, and becomes strongly and easily impelled to follow the path which Christ Himself and His Mother have followed.\"<ref>[[Pope Pius XII]] Rosary encyclical [[Ingruentium Malorum]] on the Vatican website [https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_15091951_ingruentium-malorum_en.html]</ref>\n\nAlthough [[Pope John Paul II]] is best known for his devotion to the Rosary, he stated that he viewed the Scapular as a \"habit\" to orient one's Christian life: \"The sign of the Scapular points to an effective synthesis of Marian spirituality, which nourishes the devotion of believers and makes them sensitive to the Virgin Mother's loving presence in their lives... devotion to her cannot be limited to prayers and tributes in her honor on certain occasions, but must become a \"habit\", that is, a permanent orientation of one's own Christian conduct.\"<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/speeches/2001/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_20010326_ordine-carmelo_en.html John Paul II Scapular Message at the Vatican website]</ref>\n\nThe wearing of a Scapular has been viewed as ''constant meditation'' by Bishop Leo De Goesbriand: \"Wherever I am, whatever I am doing, Mary never sees me without seeing upon my body an evidence of my devotion to her.\"<ref>L.

Although he died in 1928, he is considered the founder of the school. The school's first [[Head teacher|headmaster]] was [[Arthur Foot|Arthur E.

He was the fourth British headmaster in Doon's history and a member of [[Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference]], [[UK]].\n\nThe school houses roughly 500 pupils aged 12 to 18, and admission is based on a competitive entrance examination, a group discussion and an interview with the headmaster. Every year in January and April, the school admits pupils aged 13 in Grade 7 (known as D-form) and aged 14 in Grade 8 (C-form) respectively. Boys take the [[IGCSE]] exam in Grade 10, and for the final two years can choose between [[Indian School Certificate]] or [[International Baccalaureate]] curriculum. Doon remains a boys-only school despite continued pressure from political leaders, including former [[President of India|President]] [[Pratibha Patil]], to become [[Mixed-sex education|coeducational]]. [[Old boy network|Old boys]] of the school are known as 'Doscos'. \n\nDoon has been consistently ranked the best all-boys residential school in [[India]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dailypioneer.com/2019/state-editions/17-schools-from-u---khand-secure-top-10-positions-in-ewisr.html|title=17 schools from U\u2019khand secure Top 10 positions in EWISR|first=The|last=Pioneer|website=The Pioneer}}</ref> Although the school has often been cited as 'Eton of India' by media outlets such as the [[BBC]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02c3zgq|title=BBC World Service - Witness, India's Eton|website=BBC}}</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]'',<ref>{{cite news|author=STEVEN R.

Although he died in 1928, he is considered the founder of the school. The school's first [[Head teacher|headmaster]] was [[Arthur Foot|Arthur E.

He was the fourth British headmaster in Doon's history and a member of [[Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference]], [[UK]].\n\nDoon houses roughly 500 pupils aged 13 to 18, and admission is based on a competitive entrance examination, a group discussion and an interview with the headmaster. Every year in January and April, the school admits pupils aged 13 in Grade 7 (known as D-form) and aged 14 in Grade 8 (C-form) respectively. Boys take the [[IGCSE]] exam in Grade 10, and for the final two years can choose between [[Indian School Certificate]] or [[International Baccalaureate]] curriculum. Doon remains a boys-only school despite continued pressure from political leaders, including former [[President of India|President]] [[Pratibha Patil]], to become [[Mixed-sex education|coeducational]]. [[Old boy network|Old boys]] of the school are known as 'Doscos'. \n\nDoon has been consistently ranked the best all-boys residential school in [[India]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dailypioneer.com/2019/state-editions/17-schools-from-u---khand-secure-top-10-positions-in-ewisr.html|title=17 schools from U\u2019khand secure Top 10 positions in EWISR|first=The|last=Pioneer|website=The Pioneer}}</ref> Although the school has often been cited as 'Eton of India' by media outlets such as the [[BBC]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02c3zgq|title=BBC World Service - Witness, India's Eton|website=BBC}}</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]'',<ref>{{cite news|author=STEVEN R.

To solve this problem, Sir Joseph Bhore, then Railway Minister of [[Freeman Freeman-Thomas, 1st Marquess of Willingdon|Lord Willingdon's]] Council, became IPSS chairman and, with [[Akbar Hydari|Sir Akbar Hydari]] as secretary, worked to obtain the former estate of the [[Forest Research Institute (India)|Forest Research Institute]] in [[Dehra Dun]] on favourable terms.

ATTAC representatives attend the meetings of the [[G8]] with the goal of influencing policymakers' decisions. Attac spokesmen recently criticised [[Germany]] for what it called the criminalisation of anti-G8 groups.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/EFC22DAF-E4DF-4E86-A850-0D3E2F67E81C.htm |title=German police raid G8 opponents |accessdate=2007-05-10| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070512012829/http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/EFC22DAF-E4DF-4E86-A850-0D3E2F67E81C.htm| archivedate= 12 May 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nAt the founding, ATTAC had specific statutory objectives based on the promotion of the Tobin tax. For example, ATTAC [[Luxembourg]] specifies in article 1 of its statutes that it \n<blockquote>\"aims to produce and communicate information, and to promote and carry out activities of all kinds for the recapture, by the citizens, of the power that the financial sector has on all aspects of political, economic, social and cultural life throughout the world. Such means include the taxation of transactions in foreign exchange markets (Tobin tax).\"<ref name=LLUX>[http://www.etat.lu/memorial/2000/C/Pdf/c0470047.pdf#Page=42 ''Luxembourg Official Journal'', p. 42, ATTAC Statutes (Translated from French)]</ref></blockquote>\n\nATTAC refutes claims that it is an [[anti-globalisation movement]], but it criticises the [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal ideology]] that it sees as dominating economic globalisation. It supports those globalisation policies that their representatives characterise as [[Sustainable development|sustainable]] and [[Social justice|socially just]].<ref name=Moberg /> One of ATTAC's slogans is \"The World is not for sale\", denouncing the \"[[Merchandization|merchandisation]]\" of society. Another slogan is \"Another world is possible\", pointing to an alternative globalisation in which people and not profit is in focus.\n\n===James Tobin opposing ATTAC===\nAttac was founded to promote the [[Tobin tax]] by the [[Keynesian]] economist [[James Tobin]]. Tobin has said that Attac has misused his name. He says he has nothing in common with their goals and supports [[free trade]] \u2014 \"everything that these movements are attacking. They're misusing my name.\" <ref name=spiegel>[http://www.econ.yale.edu/news/tobin/jt_01-09-02_ds_misusing-name.htm \"They Are Misusing My Name\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928082207/http://www.econ.yale.edu/news/tobin/jt_01-09-02_ds_misusing-name.htm |date=September 28, 2011 }}, an interview with James Tobin, ''Der Spiegel'', 03 September 2001</ref>\n\n==Organisational history==\nIn December 1997, [[Ignacio Ramonet]] wrote in ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'' an editorial<ref name=\"Disarming the markets\"/> in which he advocated the establishment of the [[Tobin tax]] and the creation of an organisation to pressure governments around the world to introduce the tax.  ATTAC was created on June 3, 1998, during a constitutive assembly in [[France]].  While it was founded in France it now exists in over forty countries around the world.<ref>[http://www.attac.org/about/map ATTAC chapters around the world]</ref>  In France, politicians from the left  are members of the association. {{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}  In Luxembourg, [[Francois Bausch]] of the left Green party is the founding politician in the association's initial member list.<ref name=LLUX />\n\nATTAC functions on a principle of [[decentralisation]]: local associations organise meetings, conferences, and compose documents that become counter-arguments to the perceived neoliberal discourse. ATTAC aims to formalise the possibility of an alternative to the neoliberal society that is currently required of globalisation. ATTAC aspires to be a movement of popular education.\n\n==Views on Attac and its members in different countries==\n\n=== Finland ===\nCommunist [[Juhani Lohikoski]], previously a chairman of [[Communist Youth League]] and [[Socialist League (Finland)|Socialist League]], served as the chairman of Finnish Attac for two terms (2002 - 2004). [[Yrj\u00f6 Hakanen]], chairman of the [[Communist Party of Finland (1997)|Communist Party of Finland]], was a member of the board and a member of the founding committee. In March 2002 [[Aimo Kairamo]], the long-time chief editor of the party organ of the Social Democrat Party, resigned from Attac and recommended the same decision for other social democrats because of the left-wing minority communists' leading positions. Soon also the social democrat foreign minister [[Erkki Tuomioja]] considered to follow Kairamo's example.<ref>[http://www.mtv3.fi/uutiset/arkisto.shtml/arkistot/kotimaa/2002/04/107087 Tuomioja eroaa Attacista?] MTV3.fi, 03.04.2002</ref>\n\n=== Sweden ===\nResearcher Malin Gawell covers the birth and development of Attac Sweden in her doctoral thesis on activist entrepreneurship. She suggests that Attac in Sweden was formed by people seeking a new way of organising with flat hierarchy, and with the strongly sensed need of making a change as the driving force.<ref>[http://su.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:189996/FULLTEXT01 Gawell, Malin (2006). Activist entrepreneurship: attac'ing norms and articulating disclosive stories. Diss. Stockholm : Stockholms universitet, 2007]</ref>\n<br />\nFrom another perspective, [[Sydsvenskan]] newspaper suggested that the downturn of memberships in Swedish Attac after the hype in the beginning of 2001 may be due to its views on trade policies.<ref name=syds191>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071006032639/http://sydsvenskan.se/opinion/huvudledare/article57740.ece Det goda livet], [[Sydsvenskan]], p\u00e4\u00e4kirjoitus 19.1.2004</ref>\n\n==Issues and activities==\nThe main issues covered by ATTAC today are:{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n* Control of financial markets (e.g., Tobin tax)\n* \"Fair\" instead of \"free\" trade, via democratic control of the [[World Trade Organization]] and international financial institutions such the [[International Monetary Fund]], [[Worldbank]], [[European Union]], [[North American Free Trade Agreement]], [[Free Trade Area of the Americas]], and [[G8]].\n* Defense of public goods - air, water, information\n* Defense of public social services - like those relevant to health, social services, and [[social security]].  For example, it is against the [[privatisation]] of [[pension]]s and of the [[health care system]].  ATTAC has also taken a position on genetically modified organisms.  ATTAC also opposes [[General Agreement on Trade in Services]].\n* The struggle to end tax evasion ([[corporate haven|tax havens]]) as practiced by transnational corporations and rich individuals\n* Sustainable globalisation\n* Cancellation of the [[debt of Developing Countries]].\n* ATTAC campaigned against the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe]].\n* ATTAC is involved in fighting against [[climate change]], for [[environmental justice]] and, especially, in supporting [[Alternatiba, Village of Alternatives]].\n\nIn France, ATTAC associates with many other [[left-wing]] causes.\n\n==Nestl\u00e9gate==\nIn the year 2008 Attac [[Switzerland]] was hit by a scandal which was later called Nestl\u00e9gate by the local media. Between the years 2003 and 2005, the Swiss multinational food and beverage company [[Nestl\u00e9]], engaged the external Security company [[Securitas AG]], to spy on the Swiss Attac branch.

ATTAC representatives attend the meetings of the [[G8]] with the goal of influencing policymakers' decisions. Attac spokesmen recently criticised [[Germany]] for what it called the criminalisation of anti-G8 groups.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/EFC22DAF-E4DF-4E86-A850-0D3E2F67E81C.htm |title=German police raid G8 opponents |accessdate=2007-05-10| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070512012829/http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/EFC22DAF-E4DF-4E86-A850-0D3E2F67E81C.htm| archivedate= 12 May 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nAt the founding, ATTAC had specific statutory objectives based on the promotion of the Tobin tax. For example, ATTAC [[Luxembourg]] specifies in article 1 of its statutes that it \n<blockquote>\"aims to produce and communicate information, and to promote and carry out activities of all kinds for the recapture, by the citizens, of the power that the financial sector has on all aspects of political, economic, social and cultural life throughout the world. Such means include the taxation of transactions in foreign exchange markets (Tobin tax).\"<ref name=LLUX>[http://www.etat.lu/memorial/2000/C/Pdf/c0470047.pdf#Page=42 ''Luxembourg Official Journal'', p. 42, ATTAC Statutes (Translated from French)]</ref></blockquote>\n\nATTAC refutes claims that it is an [[anti-globalisation movement]], but it criticises the [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal ideology]] that it sees as dominating economic globalisation. It supports those globalisation policies that their representatives characterise as [[Sustainable development|sustainable]] and [[Social justice|socially just]].<ref name=Moberg /> One of ATTAC's slogans is \"The World is not for sale\", denouncing the \"[[Merchandization|merchandisation]]\" of society. Another slogan is \"Another world is possible\", pointing to an alternative globalisation in which people and not profit is in focus.\n\n===James Tobin opposing ATTAC===\nAttac was founded to promote the [[Tobin tax]] by the [[Keynesian]] economist [[James Tobin]]. Tobin has said that Attac has misused his name. He says he has nothing in common with their goals and supports [[free trade]] \u2014 \"everything that these movements are attacking. They're misusing my name.\" <ref name=spiegel>[http://www.econ.yale.edu/news/tobin/jt_01-09-02_ds_misusing-name.htm \"They Are Misusing My Name\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928082207/http://www.econ.yale.edu/news/tobin/jt_01-09-02_ds_misusing-name.htm |date=September 28, 2011 }}, an interview with James Tobin, ''Der Spiegel'', 03 September 2001</ref>\n\n==Organisational history==\nIn December 1997, [[Ignacio Ramonet]] wrote in ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'' an editorial<ref name=\"Disarming the markets\"/> in which he advocated the establishment of the [[Tobin tax]] and the creation of an organisation to pressure governments around the world to introduce the tax.  ATTAC was created on June 3, 1998, during a constitutive assembly in [[France]].  While it was founded in France it now exists in over forty countries around the world.<ref>[http://www.attac.org/about/map ATTAC chapters around the world]</ref>  In France, politicians from the left  are members of the association. {{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}  In Luxembourg, [[Francois Bausch]] of the left Green party is the founding politician in the association's initial member list.<ref name=LLUX />\n\nATTAC functions on a principle of [[decentralisation]]: local associations organise meetings, conferences, and compose documents that become counter-arguments to the perceived neoliberal discourse. ATTAC aims to formalise the possibility of an alternative to the neoliberal society that is currently required of globalisation. ATTAC aspires to be a movement of popular education.\n\n==Views on Attac and its members in different countries==\n\n=== Finland ===\nCommunist [[Juhani Lohikoski]], previously a chairman of [[Communist Youth League]] and [[Socialist League (Finland)|Socialist League]], served as the chairman of Finnish Attac for two terms (2002 - 2004). [[Yrj\u00f6 Hakanen]], chairman of the [[Communist Party of Finland (1997)|Communist Party of Finland]], was a member of the board and a member of the founding committee. In March 2002 [[Aimo Kairamo]], the long-time chief editor of the party organ of the Social Democrat Party, resigned from Attac and recommended the same decision for other social democrats because of the left-wing minority communists' leading positions. Soon also the social democrat foreign minister [[Erkki Tuomioja]] considered to follow Kairamo's example.<ref>[http://www.mtv3.fi/uutiset/arkisto.shtml/arkistot/kotimaa/2002/04/107087 Tuomioja eroaa Attacista?] MTV3.fi, 03.04.2002</ref>\n\n=== Sweden ===\nResearcher Malin Gawell covers the birth and development of Attac Sweden in her doctoral thesis on activist entrepreneurship. She suggests that Attac in Sweden was formed by people seeking a new way of organising with flat hierarchy, and with the strongly sensed need of making a change as the driving force.<ref>[http://su.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:189996/FULLTEXT01 Gawell, Malin (2006). Activist entrepreneurship: attac'ing norms and articulating disclosive stories. Diss. Stockholm : Stockholms universitet, 2007]</ref>\n<br />\nFrom another perspective, [[Sydsvenskan]] newspaper suggested that the downturn of memberships in Swedish Attac after the hype in the beginning of 2001 may be due to its views on trade policies.<ref name=syds191>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071006032639/http://sydsvenskan.se/opinion/huvudledare/article57740.ece Det goda livet], [[Sydsvenskan]], p\u00e4\u00e4kirjoitus 19.1.2004</ref>\n\n==Issues and activities==\nThe main issues covered by ATTAC today are:{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n* Control of financial markets (e.g., Tobin tax)\n* \"Fair\" instead of \"free\" trade, via democratic control of the [[World Trade Organization]] and international financial institutions such the [[International Monetary Fund]], [[Worldbank]], [[European Union]], [[North American Free Trade Agreement]], [[Free Trade Area of the Americas]], and [[G8]].\n* Defense of public goods - air, water, information\n* Defense of public social services - like those relevant to health, social services, and [[social security]].  For example, it is against the [[privatisation]] of [[pension]]s and of the [[health care system]].  ATTAC has also taken a position on genetically modified organisms.  ATTAC also opposes [[General Agreement on Trade in Services]].\n* The struggle to end tax evasion ([[corporate haven|tax havens]]) as practiced by transnational corporations and rich individuals\n* Sustainable globalisation\n* Cancellation of the [[debt of Developing Countries]].\n* ATTAC campaigned against the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe]].\n* ATTAC is involved in fighting against [[climate change]], for [[environmental justice]] and, especially, in supporting [[Alternatiba, Village of Alternatives]].\n\nIn France, ATTAC associates with many other [[left-wing]] causes.\n\n==Nestl\u00e9gate==\nIn the year 2008 Attac [[Switzerland]] was hit by a scandal which was later called Nestl\u00e9gate by the local media. Between the years 2003 and 2005, the Swiss multinational food and beverage company [[Nestl\u00e9]], engaged the external Security company [[Securitas AG]], to spy on the Swiss Attac branch. Nestl\u00e9 started the monitoring, when Attac Switzerland decided to work on a critical book about Nestl\u00e9.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Klawitter|first1=Nils|title=Spitzel-Aff\u00e4re um Nestl\u00e9|url=http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/unternehmen/spitzel-affaere-um-nestle-das-war-klassisches-profiling-a-811608.html|accessdate=6 April 2015|publisher=Spiegel.de|date=2012-01-30}}</ref>\n\nDue to Nestl\u00e9gate, Attac Switzerland filed a lawsuit against Nestl\u00e9 which was decided in favour of Attac in January 2013, as the personal rights of the observed were violated.
