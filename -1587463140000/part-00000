Buck had moved to the Seattle area in 1992; the other principals were longtime fixtures of the Seattle music scene.  The four musicians had numerous personal and professional connections: both the Posies and McCaughey's [[Young Fresh Fellows|The Young Fresh Fellows]] had recorded at [[Conrad Uno]]'s Egg Studios and released albums on Uno's [[PopLlama|PopLlama Records]] label.  The Young Fresh Fellows and The Posies were fixtures of Seattle's [[Crocodile Cafe]], owned and managed by Buck's then-girlfriend (later wife) Stephanie Dorgan.  The Young Fresh Fellows were the opening band at a [[Kevn Kinney]] gig at the Croc On July 4, 1992; Buck backed Kinney along with R.E.M.'s [[Mike Mills]] and [[Bill Berry]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Scanlon|first1=Tom|title=R.E.M.'s Peter Buck: talking about the passion|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20020709&slug=buck09|website=Seattle Times|accessdate=21 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=1992/93/94 Concert Chronology|url=http://remtimeline.com/1992.html|website=R.E.M. Timeline|accessdate=21 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe band's name is a nod to classic-rock quintets such as [[The Count Five]], [[MC5]] and [[The Dave Clark Five]] and part of a trend of intentionally-misnamed groups such as [[Ben Folds Five]] and [[Pizzicato Five]] which had fewer than five members.  The use of a [[negative number]] in the band name is typical of the self-deprecating humor pervasive in the then grunge-saturated Seattle music scene.\n\nThe song titles of the group's earliest output\u2014among them, \"Loser So Supreme,\" \"Drunkard's Lullaby,\" and \"Brotherhood Of Pain\"\u2014are indicative of the downbeat nature of the band's initial output.  Themes of [[alcoholism]], [[death]], and [[self-hatred]] are recurrent in each subsequent Minus 5 release.  \"McCaughey realized he had a dumptruck-load of songs that the Young Fresh Fellows would either never get around to, or would wisely choose not to,\" read one press release. \"[Buck, Stringfellow and Auer] were quick to volunteer to help Scott capture his 'Let The Bad Times Roll' vision.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://billions.com/theminus5|title=The Minus 5|website=Billions.com|accessdate=21 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Hello Recording Club EP ===\nThe band assembled at Uno's Egg Studio in summer 1993 and recorded their debut EP for the [[Hello CD of the Month Club]], a subscription-only mail order club run by [[John Flansburgh]] of [[They Might Be Giants]].  For this EP the band were supplemented by [[NRBQ]] members Tom Ardolino and Terry Adams and Young Fresh Fellows bassist Jim Sangster.  McCaughey's darkly humorous lyrics and [[minor key]] compositions meshed seamlessly with Buck's bright guitar hooks.  The band's aesthetic is defined by opener \"Loser So Supreme,\" which pairs the chiming mandolin licks Buck popularized on \"[[Losing My Religion]]\" with downbeat observations like \"No one can reveal what has always been revealed/No one can invent a world that already exists.\"  Auer and Stringfellow, known more for their power-pop inflected [[Vocal harmony|vocal harmonies]] and [[guitar solo]]s, added [[Cacophony|cacophonous]] textures on piano, keyboards and guitar.\n\nFor this release only the band's name was stylized as 'The Minus Five'; all subsequent releases have used a numeral.  The EP was sent to subscribers as the December 1993/January 1994 release.<ref>{{cite book|last1=The Minus Five|title=The Minus Five|date=Dec 1993|publisher=Hello Recording Club}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Minus Five: The Minus Five|url=https://www.discogs.com/Minus-Five-The-The-Minus-Five/release/1056080|website=Discogs.com|accessdate=21 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Live debut and 1994 recording sessions ===\nThe Minus 5 made their live debut at the Crocodile Cafe on November 9, 1993 on a bill supporting jangly indie heroes The Silos.  As Auer and Stringfellow were in Europe touring behind the Posies' [[Frosting On The Beater]], the Minus 5 performed as a duo with backing from The Silos' [[Walter Salas-Humara]], [[Tom Freund]] and Manuel Versoza for the last three songs.  The set included lively covers of Johnny Cash's \"I Still Miss Someone\" and Neil Young's \"Barstool Blues\" as well as four freshly-written McCaughey compositions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://remtimeline.com/1992.html|title=1992/93/94 Concert Chronology|website=R.E.M. Timeline|accessdate=21 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nAt the time, it was widely assumed that the Minus 5 was a one-off proposition that might not record again, and certainly never tour due to the primary obligations of the principal musicians.  However, McCaughey continued to record at various Seattle studios including Egg, Down In The Hole and Private Radio throughout 1994. [[NRBQ]]'s Ardolino and Adams contributed to two more cuts; [[The Walkabouts]]' Carla Torgerson and Chris Eckman added cello and guitar; legendary Seattle street performer Richard Peterson played various horns.  McCaughey also recorded Young Fresh Fellows' ''Temptation On A Saturday'' EP during this period using some of the same musicians.\n\nDue to recording duties on R.E.M.'s [[Monster (R.E.M. album)|''Monster'']], Buck was away from Seattle for much of 1994, returning only briefly for the birth of his twin daughters.  When mixing on R.E.M.'s album was complete, Buck turned his attention to McCaughey's new songs.  The Minus 5 played their second show at the Crocodile Cafe on September 15, 1994, just a week before ''Monster''<nowiki/>'s release.  For this gig McCaughey, Buck and Stringfellow were joined by The Model Rockets' John Ramberg.\n\nBy fall 1994, McCaughey was caught up in the promotional blitz behind ''Monster'', making his live debut with R.E.M. on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' November 12, 1994.  McCaughey was subsequently recruited to join R.E.M. on their worldwide tour which kicked off in January 1995.\n\nThe Minus 5's cover of Johnny Cash's \"I Still Miss Someone\" was released on a 1994 German compilation titled ''Love Is My Only Crime \u2013 Part Two''.  The CD also featured rare or previously unreleased songs from The Young Fresh Fellows and future McCaughey collaborator [[Steve Wynn (musician)|Steve Wynn]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Various-Love-Is-My-Only-Crime-Part-Two/release/1435046|title=Various \u2013 Love Is My Only Crime \u2013 Part Two|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2017-11-24}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Old Liquidator'' ===\nIn April 1995, R.E.M. drummer [[Bill Berry]] suffered a [[brain aneurysm]], causing more than two months of planned tour dates to be abruptly cancelled.  In the unexpected downtime, McCaughey and Buck put the finishing touches on what would become the Minus 5's debut LP\u2014at the time titled ''Last Call, Corporal.''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Minus-5-Last-Call-Corporal/release/6197409|title=The Minus 5 \u2013 Last Call, Corporal|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2017-11-22}}</ref>\n\nThe finished product, hastily retitled ''[[Old Liquidator]]'', was at first a hard-to-find, low-key release on German indie label Glitterhouse.  Though pressed in modest numbers and at first only available in the U.S. as an import, the cache of being an 'R.E.M. side project' in 1995 was an irresistible lure to thirsty collectors.  It wasn't long before Minneapolis distributor [[East Side Digital Records|East Side Digital]] released the album in the U.S. as well.\n\n''Old Liquidator'' is haunted by the unexpected Christmas 1994 death of McCaughey's friend Jimmy Silva, who had collaborated with Young Fresh Fellows, Stringfellow, Uno and members of [[The Smithereens]].  \"Worse,\" the second track on the album, was co-written with Silva.  Other cuts such as \"Story\" are influenced by the surrealist imagery of mid-60s Bob Dylan, invoking fictional misadventures of figures including [[Franz Kafka]].\n\nAnother inspiration is [[Nick Lowe]], whose obscure 1979 B-side \"Basing Street\" is smothered here in the squealing distortion Buck patented on \"[[Country Feedback]].\"  Elsewhere, Buck's exotic bouzouki and dulcimer textures proved welcome departures from ''Monster''<nowiki/>'s fuzzed-out glam riffs. [[The Byrds]]-influenced [[Rickenbacker]] jangle of single \"Emperor Of The Bathroom\" is unmistakably Buck.  Auer and Stringfellow are more tangible on this album, harmonizing amiably on opener \"Winter Goes Away\" and closing singalong \"When It Comes My Way.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Old Liquidator|last=The Minus 5|publisher=East Side Digital Records|year=1995|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n''Old Liquidator'' begins The Minus 5's custom of numbering their releases, including singles, in [[Chronology|chronological order.]]  On the back cover, the subtitle \"The Minus 5 No. 2 Record\" is prominently displayed above the musicians' names.\n\nA CD single for \"[[The Emperor of the Bathroom|The Emperor Of The Bathroom]]\" was released in fall 1995 with alternate versions of three album cuts, a country-fried outtake called \"Heartache For Sale\" and a cover of the Fantastic Baggys' \"This Little Woody.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Emperor Of The Bathroom|last=The Minus 5|publisher=East Side Digital Records|year=1995|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nWhen the ''Monster'' tour resumed in summer 1995, R.E.M. began recording what would later become the [[New Adventures in Hi-Fi|''New Adventures In Hi-Fi'']] album using recordings of new songs made in concert, at soundchecks, in dressing rooms and even on the tour bus.  McCaughey, again called along for the ride, contributed significantly to these recordings playing piano, organ, synths and autoharp.\n\nBetween R.E.M. gigs on June 1, 1995, The Minus 5 played their first show outside of Seattle at the [[Lounge Ax]] in Chicago.  Without Auer and Stringfellow, Buck and McCaughey were supported by [[Wilco]] frontman [[Jeff Tweedy]], R.E.M. bassist [[Mike Mills]], and Mark Greenberg.  New songs \"Moonshine Girl\" and \"Wouldn't Want To Care\" were debuted alongside Johnny Cash, Nick Lowe, Gram Parsons and Porter Wagoner covers.\n\nDuring another tour hiatus, The Minus 5 played gigs at the Tractor Tavern and Crocodile Cafe in Seattle at the end of August 1995.  New song \"Bullfight\" was debuted at these shows, which featured [[The Young Fresh Fellows|Young Fresh Fellows]] and [[Fastbacks]] guitarist [[Kurt Bloch]] in addition to McCaughey, Buck and Auer.\n\nIn December 1995, The Minus 5 played two nights at the Crocodile Cafe in support of Kevn Kinney, supplemented by [[Screaming Trees]]' [[Barrett Martin]] on upright bass.  The Minus 5 and Kevn Kinney also played at the Aladdin Theater in Portland as The Barrett Martin Quartet.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://remtimeline.com/1995.html|title=1995 Concert Chronology|website=R.E.M. Timeline|access-date=2017-11-22}}</ref>\n\n=== Hollywood Records deal and ''The Lonesome Death of Buck McCoy'' ===\nThe modest success of ''Old Liquidator'' and continued cultural cache of R.E.M. brought The Minus 5 a great deal of attention in 1996.  Not only were the group signed to [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]-affiliated [[Hollywood Records]], but the label agreed to finance a follow-up record and even reissue some of McCaughey's back catalog.  Moreover, McCaughey was given his own label imprint, Malt Records, with distribution through Hollywood.\n\nThough the bulk of recording for ''New Adventures In Hi-Fi'' had taken place on the road, Buck was occupied through early 1996 with recording and mixing the new [[R.E.M.]] album.  Nonetheless, McCaughey and Buck continued to record in piecemeal sessions with [[Avast! Recording Company|Avast!]] engineer Kevin Suggs, Conrad Uno, [[John Keane (record producer)|John Keane]], and Water Music's Rob Grenoble.  In late summer, The Minus 5 played [[KISW]]'s Pain In The Grass concert in support of [[The Posies]], who were busy touring behind their 1996 release ''[[Amazing Disgrace]]''.  New songs \"Cross Every Line\" and \"Empty Room\" were premiered by a lineup including McCaughey, Buck, Auer, Stringfellow and John Ramberg.\n\n''New Adventures In Hi-Fi'' was released September 10, 1996.  With no tour planned to promote the album, Buck was free to explore other musical pursuits.  In early fall 1996, Buck embarked on two new musical collaborations: the instrumental supergroup [[Tuatara (band)|Tuatara]] with Barrett Martin, and a collaborative album with [[American Music Club]]'s [[Mark Eitzel]].  Martin joined the Minus 5 for a Crocodile Cafe gig on October 7, 1996 where new songs \"Hate Me More\" and \"Dear Employer (The Reason I Quit\") were debuted. McCaughey's then-wife [[Christy McWilson]] also joined the group for this show.  The following week, Tuatara made their live debut at the Croc.\n\nIn December 1996, Buck booked a week with engineer Ed Brooks at Ironwood in Seattle to record Eitzel's [[West (Mark Eitzel album)|''West'']] album.  McCaughey, Martin, and [[Pearl Jam]]'s [[Mike McCready]] were all on hand for the sessions.  At the end of the sessions, The Minus 5 opened for Eitzel at the Crocodile Cafe.  Martin and Eitzel both joined The Minus 5 for several songs and McCaughey premiered new song \"Boeing Spacearium.\"  The second Minus 5 full-length, dubbed ''[[The Lonesome Death of Buck McCoy]]'', was completed at Ironwood shortly thereafter.\n\n''The Lonesome Death of Buck McCoy'', cobbled together from McCaughey's many 1996 sessions, featured an impressive roster of guests including [[Guided by Voices]]' [[Robert Pollard]], [[The Presidents of the United States of America (band)|The Presidents of the United States of America]], McWilson, Barrett Martin and Mike McCready.  Unlike previous releases, each song was credited equally to McCaughey and Buck.  In the liner notes each player was assigned a \"role\" as in a rock opera, with McCaughey himself playing \"Buck McCoy\" and others assuming roles like \"Admiral Boot,\" \"The Constable\" and \"Ancient Roomer.\"  In reference to the creative process of the album, the liner notes provide a synopsis:  \"Little Buck McCoy wakes up born in the middle of a wheatfield. He decides to carry on alone, despite his many acquaintances, until dying years later.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Lonesome Death of Buck McCoy|last=The Minus 5|publisher=Hollywood Records|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nThe songs did not actually constitute a narrative or refer to these characters at all.  Critics took note of the haphazard nature of the proceedings, which included Small Faces pastiche \"Popsycle Shoppe\" and a cover of [[John Lennon]]'s harrowing \"My Mummy's Dead.\" [[No Depression (magazine)|No Depression]] called the album \"Surprisingly bitter froth...Most of the record's 12 songs quake with the severely compressed intimacy and hazy chamber-ballad tension of recent R.E.M. (no surprise) and John Lennon.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nodepression.com/album-review/minus-5-lonesome-death-buck-mccoy|title=Minus 5 \u2013 The Lonesome Death Of Buck McCoy|date=1997-06-30|work=No Depression|access-date=2017-11-24}}</ref>  Hollywood Records did not release a single to promote the album.\n\n=== The Magnificent Seven vs. The United States tour ===\nIn early 1997, R.E.M. began the process of writing demos for a new album both in [[Athens, Georgia|Athens]] in February and Buck's Hawaiian residence in April.  The three albums Buck had contributed to in 1996 were all released within weeks of one another. Tuatara's [[Breaking the Ethers|''Breaking The Ethers'']] was released March 1, 1997, followed by Eitzel's [[West (Mark Eitzel album)|''West'']] and ''[[The Lonesome Death of Buck McCoy]]'' on the same day: May 5, 1997.  A U.S. tour was assembled that would allow Buck to tour both coasts with all three acts, under the title ''The Magnificent Seven vs. The United States.''  The Magnificent Seven referred to McCaughey, Stringfellow, Eitzel, Martin and the three remaining members of Tuatara\u2014though counting Buck there were actually eight.  American Music Club bassist Dan Pearson later joined the tour to augment Eitzel's sets.  For this tour The Minus 5 consisted of Buck, McCaughey, Stringfellow, Martin, and Tuatara's [[Justin Harwood]].\n\nThe tour kicked off May 1, 1997 with two hometown gigs at the Crocodile.  Each show featured Tuatara and Eitzel performing two sets each, with a short Minus 5 set between and occasionally McCaughey performing solo.  The 22-date tour continued for two months, with many media appearances along the way.  Buck and Eitzel performed on [[KNBR-FM|KFOG]] in San Francisco, [[Late Night with Conan O'Brien|Late Night With Conan O'Brien]] and then on [[WBCN (FM)|WBCN]] radio in Boston.  All three groups played [[Morning Becomes Eclectic]] on [[KCRW]] in Santa Monica and [[Vin Scelsa|Idiot's Delight]] on [[WNEW-FM|WNEW]] in New York.  Near the end of the tour all three groups played a free in-store at New York record mecca [[Other Music]].\n\nThe East Coast leg of the tour was peppered with surprise guests: [[Pearl Jam]]'s [[Mike McCready]] and [[John Wesley Harding (singer)|John Wesley Harding]] showed up in New York, [[Mike Mills]] joined The Minus 5 in Philadelphia and Atlanta, and [[Michael Stipe]] joined his R.E.M. bandmates for a four-song encore in Atlanta.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://remtimeline.com/1996.html|title=1996/97/98 Concert Chronology|website=R.E.M. Timeline|access-date=2017-11-24}}</ref>\n\nReaction to the tour was mixed.  None of the three records sold particularly well, and the critics' approval was tepid:  \"A three-hour marathon that was simply too much to absorb,\" Sara Scribner wrote in the [[Los Angeles Times]]. \"The Minus 5, despite some catchy, jangling tunes from its new album...never got its footing.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997-05-16/entertainment/ca-59194_1_peter-buck|title=Peter Buck Splinters Into a Three-Band Musical Circus Act|last=SCRIBNER|first=SARA|date=1997-05-16|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-11-24|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}</ref> [[Geoffrey Himes]] wrote in [[The Washington Post]]: \"Genuinely amusing when the tunes were bouncy and catchy, but the slow numbers didn't have the humor or melody to justify the dreary pacing.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1997/05/31/the-magnificent-seven-buck-stops-here/eb0f4433-1f6c-4e83-9073-5bd24c0e5f8a/|title=THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN: BUCK STOPS HERE|last=Himes|first=Geoffrey|date=1997-05-31|work=Washington Post|access-date=2017-11-24|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1997, Buck recorded some tracks with [[Robyn Hitchcock]] for his album [[Jewels for Sophia|Jewels For Sophia]] in Seattle.  After the session, McCaughey joined Hitchcock and Buck for a Crocodile Cafe gig under the name \"Popscyle Shoppe Incident: Viva Sea Tac II.\" [[Tim Keegan]] and Kurt Bloch joined in the set, and Young Fresh Fellows were the opening act.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://remtimeline.com/1996.html|title=1996/97/98 Concert Chronology|website=R.E.M. Timeline|access-date=2017-11-24}}</ref>\n\n=== Hollywood Records deluxe reissues ===\nIn August 1997, Hollywood Records reissued ''[[Old Liquidator]]'' and, curiously, McCaughey's 1989 solo album ''[[My Chartreuse Opinion]]'' in deluxe editions with bonus tracks.  ''My Chartreuse Opinion'', a Conrad Uno-recorded affair which featured cameos from Jimmy Silva and Christy McWilson, was now credited to \"The Minus 5 of Scott McCaughey.\"  The reissue actually featured fewer bonus tracks than the now out-of-print original release, which featured four unrelated Silva recordings at the end.  Nonetheless, it was a great way of drawing attention to McCaughey's back catalog and much easier to find than the initial release.  ''Old Liquidator'' was also expanded, adding two songs from the Hello Recording Club EP, \"Heartache For Sale\" from the \"Emperor of the Bathroom\" single, and two short instrumentals.<ref>{{Cite book|title=My Chartreuse Opinion|last=The Minus 5|publisher=Hollywood Records|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Old Liquidator|last=The Minus 5|publisher=Hollywood Records|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nThese would prove to be The Minus 5's final releases on Hollywood.  Just weeks before the release of ''The Lonesome Death of Buck McCoy'', longtime Hollywood Records president Bob Pfeifer resigned.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1997-04-17/news/9704180160_1_calif-based-disney-pfeifer-musician-and-talent-scout|title=Head of struggling Disney music unit quits: Walt Disney...|work=Chicago Tribune|access-date=2017-11-26|language=en}}</ref>  Under a reorganization plan, Disney acquired established indie [[Mammoth Records]] for $25 million in an attempt to diversify its roster.  Mammoth founder [[Jay Faires]] was now charged with breaking The Minus 5 to a larger audience, but industry watchers such as [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'s Adam Sandler questioned why Disney didn't focus on \"pop music, which is a better fit with its TV and film programming, rather than indie-inspired repertoire.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/1997/music/news/disney-inks-mammoth-deal-1116676444/|title=Disney inks Mammoth deal|last=Sandler|first=Adam|date=1997-07-22|work=Variety|access-date=2017-11-26|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== McCaughey joins R.E.M. and Tuatara in the studio ===\nWhile R.E.M. was in Georgia recording demos for what would become [[Up (R.E.M. album)|''Up'']], The Minus 5 played its first two shows without Buck: at Chicago's Lounge Ax on August 16, 1997 the band consisted of McCaughey, Stringfellow, [[Jason Finn (musician)|Jason Finn]] and [[Dharma Bums (band)|Dharma Bums]]' Jim Talstra.  The raucous gig was by far the band's longest to date: an 11-song McCaughey solo set followed by a 22-song Minus 5 powerhouse that included unreleased songs, several nuggets from ''My Chartreuse Opinion'' and covers of John Lennon and [[The Modern Lovers]].  The following week, McCaughey played a gig with John Wesley Harding at the Croc in Seattle which included a handful of Minus 5 tunes and as-yet-unreleased Young Fresh Fellows songs.\n\nIn October 1997, Bill Berry announced he was leaving R.E.M.  Having completed more than eight months of writing and recording demos for ''Up'', R.E.M. made the decision to continue as a three-piece.  As the recording process continued in 1998, McCaughey became an important contributor in the studio, usually on keyboards.  Ken Stringfellow and Barrett Martin were also recruited for some of these sessions.  McCaughey was also roped into Tuatara in 1998, contributing three tracks to sophomore album ''[[Trading with the Enemy|Trading With The Enemy]]''.\n\nNear the end of 1997, The Minus 5 played the two-night Crocodile Cafe's An Evenings In Edenbrook Forest event, with a lineup that included McCaughey, Buck, Martin and John Ramberg.  A special double CD compilation was given away at the shows which included The Minus 5's cover of The Modern Lovers' \"Government Center\" and rare or unreleased cuts from Young Fresh Fellows, The Lowe Beats (McCaughey's Nick Lowe cover band), The Model Rockets, Fastbacks and others.  The CD was the inaugural release of Book Records, a new label McCaughey started for extremely limited or tour-only releases.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Various-An-Evenings-In-Edenbrook-Forest/release/5072737|title=Various \u2013 An Evenings In Edenbrook Forest|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2017-11-24}}</ref>\n\nIn 1999, the group accepted an invitation to participate in a [[tribute album]] to [[Moby Grape]] co-founder [[Skip Spence]], who was terminally ill with cancer, for the purpose of raising funds to assist with medical expenses.<ref>See ''[[More Oar: A Tribute to the Skip Spence Album]]''.</ref>\n\nSince McCaughey had made The Minus 5 his primary musical outlet, new material from The Young Fresh Fellows had slowed to a trickle.  In 1994 and 1995 the group had released three singles and an EP.  Nonetheless, McCaughey often recorded new songs with the Fellows and by summer 1999, had enough to release as an album.  ''A Tribute To Music'' was released on Spanish indie label Rock and Roll Inc. and never released in the U.S.  Though most of the tracks were originals, the Fellows made an unremarkable pass at R.E.M.'s rocker \"Circus Envy\" on the LP.  Considered a minor release by both fans and critics, ''A Tribute To Music'' left many wondering if McCaughey was saving his best tunes for his other band.  \"There's a tossed-off feeling to the record,\" Bart Bealmear wrote for [[AllMusic]]. \"[Most of the songs] are missing the group's unique mix of humor, energy, spirit, and melody.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/a-tribute-to-music-mw0000949235|title=A Tribute to Music \u2013 The Young Fresh Fellows|website=AllMusic|access-date=2017-11-27}}</ref>\n\n=== ''In Rock'' ===\nOn January 9, 2000 The Minus 5 played a secret show at Lounge Ax in Chicago, opening for Wilco (billed as \"Summer Teeth\") for 300 lucky fans.  This was a farewell gig as the beloved [[Lincoln Park, Chicago|Lincoln Park]] venue would shut its doors just one week later.  For this gig the Minus 5 was just McCaughey fronting Wilco, with frontman Jeff Tweedy playing bass.  The group raced through a handful of brand-new, unrehearsed songs alongside covers of influences as diverse as Mott The Hoople, Johnny Cash and Neutral Milk Hotel.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nodepression.com/live-review/last-days-lounge-ax-lounge-ax-chicago-il|title=Last Days At Lounge Ax \u2013 Lounge Ax (Chicago, IL)|date=2000-02-29|work=No Depression|access-date=2017-11-27}}</ref>\n\nA few weeks later (January 20) a more conventional Minus 5 lineup (McCaughey, Buck, Ramberg, Chris Ballew and R.E.M. session drummer [[Bill Rieflin]]) premiered eight of these new songs at the Crocodile Cafe back in Seattle.  John Wesley Harding and Kurt Block sat in on a few numbers.\n\nIn early February McCaughey and Stringfellow joined R.E.M. in Georgia to record instrumental demos for the [[Reveal (R.E.M. album)|''Reveal'']] album.  On February 25, McCaughey, Buck, Ramberg and Rieflin played another Minus 5 gig at the Crocodile, premiering new tracks \"Over The Sea\" and \"Beyond The Sea\" alongside more recent compositions.\n\nOn March 13, 2000 McCaughey assembled a skeleton crew of himself, Buck, Ramberg and R.E.M. session drummer [[Bill Rieflin]] at Jupiter Studios in Seattle and recorded ten of his latest compositions in one day.  The session included spirited takes on the [[Nightcrawlers (band)|Nightcrawlers]]' [[Power pop|power-pop]] anthem \"[[The Little Black Egg]]\", an ode to the demise of the Lounge Ax (\"The Night Chicago Died (The Death of The Minus 5)\") and even a tribute to [[Dr. Evil]], the villain in the [[Austin Powers (film series)|''Austin Powers'']] film series.\n\nOn April 25, 2000 The Minus 5 played another Croc show with a lineup of McCaughey, Buck, Stringfellow, Ramberg and Barrett Martin.  John Wesley Harding, [[Sean Nelson]] and [[The Long Winters]]' [[John Roderick (musician)|John Roderick]] sat in on the set, which included [[Bee Gees]], [[Paul McCartney and Wings|Wings]] and [[The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]] covers.  The Minus 5 returned to the Croc on June 8 with McCaughey, Buck, Ramberg, Rieflin and John Wesley Harding playing a set which included some improvised one-off songs, [[Faces (band)|Faces]] and [[Paul McCartney]] covers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://remtimeline.com/2000.html|title=2000/01 Concert Chronology|website=R.E.M. Timeline|access-date=2017-11-27}}</ref>\n\nDespite a rigorous recording schedule for R.E.M. with sessions in Georgia and [[Dublin|Dublin, Ireland]], Buck was nonetheless available for Minus 5 gigs on July 7 at Tractor Tavern at September 2 at Bumbershoot Festival at [[Memorial Stadium (Seattle)|Memorial Stadium]].  The Minus 5 were a last-minute replacement for a band that dropped out of the fest and for this show consisted of McCaughey, Buck, Ramberg, John Wesley Harding, Robert Lloyd (of Harding's band) and members of the [[The Walkabouts|Walkabouts]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.universaltrendsetter.org/Gigography.htm|title=Gigography|website=UniversalTrendsetter.org|access-date=2017-11-27}}</ref>\n\nMcCaughey pressed 1,000 copies of the March session as a surprise album, titled ''[[In Rock (The Minus 5 album)|In Rock]]''. Because it was made as a limited-edition, tour-only CD McCaughey released it on his Book label.  The CD was only available at Minus 5 shows at first, though it was later sold through the R.E.M. fanclub.  The CD was sold for the first time at an October 14, 2000 Crocodile Cafe show with McCaughey, Buck, Stringfellow, Ramberg and Rieflin.  A [[The Sonics|Sonics]] cover band (The New Original Sonic Sound) featuring members of [[Mudhoney]], Tuatara, and [[Gas Huffer]] with McCaughey on keyboards also played.\n\nIn October 2000 McCaughey and Stringfellow returned to Georgia to record with R.E.M.  During the sessions, McCaughey, Stringfellow and Mike Mills joined local group [[The Possibilities]] for a loose set that included [[Neil Young]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Chris Bell (American musician)|Chris Bell]], [[Joni Mitchell]] and [[Gram Parsons]] covers.  The Minus 5's cover of the band's \"You Don't Mean It\" would be released as a radio single just a few months later.\n\nThe Minus 5 closed out an eventful year with a Croc set on December 8, 2000 with the lineup of McCaughey, Buck, Ramberg, and Rieflin with guests John Wesley Harding, Sean Nelson, Britt Speakman, Carla Tongerson and Peter Blackstock.  A number of new songs were debuted at this show including \"A Thousand Years Away\" and \"You Don't Mean It.\"\n\n=== ''Let the War Against Music Begin'' ===\nIn 2001, the Minus Five and the [[Young Fresh Fellows]], another McCaughey project, released a split double album, ''Let the War Against Music Begin/Because We Hate You''; the \"Let the War Against Music Begin\" half was the Minus 5 submission.\n\nAfter a change of guard at [[Hollywood Records]], the Minus 5 found themselves releasing music via independent channels, with the Return to Sender label releasing a collection of outtakes from ''Let the War Against Music Begin'' called ''I Don't Know Who I Am'' before McCaughey signed the band to the [[Yep Roc]] label for his collaboration with [[Wilco]], ''Down With Wilco''. Yep Roc later issued an EP dominated by ''Down With Wilco'' outtakes, ''At the Organ'', and reissued ''In Rock'', a collection of tunes McCaughey recorded in a single day in 2000.\n\nIn 2002, the band contributed a track, \"Girl I Never Met\" to Rami Jaffee, Pete Yorn, and Marc Dauer's Trampoline Records release: Trampoline Records Volume I.\n\nThe band's seventh album, self-titled (but known as ''The Gun Album''), was released early 2006, and features, along the regular line-up, guest appearances by [[Wilco]], [[Kelly Hogan]] and [[The Decemberists]]' singer/songwriter [[Colin Meloy]], among others.\n\nBuck and McCaughey went on to play in [[The Baseball Project]] together in 2008.\n[[File:Peter Buck & Scott McCaughey.jpg|alt=Buck and McCaughey playing guitar|thumb|Buck and McCaughey playing with The Baseball Project/The Minus 5/Steve Wynn IV in 2009]]\nThe Minus 5 appeared on [[John Wesley Harding (singer)|John Wesley Harding]]'s 2009 release, ''[[Who Was Changed and Who Was Dead]]'' and released ''[[Killingsworth (album)|Killingsworth]]'' later that year.\n\nIn 2012 recorded a version of the 1976 hit single by the [[Sutherland Brothers]] and Quiver \"[[Arms of Mary]]\" for a fund raising CD titled \"Super Hits Of The Seventies\" for radio station [[WFMU]].  The band played at [[SXSW]] in 2013.\n\nIn January 2017 The Minus 5 joined [[Alejandro Escovedo]] for a short tour.  For each concert [[Scott McCaughey]], [[Kurt Bloch]], [[Peter Buck]], and [[John Moen]] played one set as the Minus Five, and then a second set backing Escovedo, sometimes with [[Kelly Hogan]], too.  All of them had also performed on Escovedo's 2016 album ''[[Burn Something Beautiful]]'', for which Escovedo, McCaughey, and Buck co-wrote the songs.<ref name=\"BurnBeautiful\">{{citation \n  | author = Escovedo, Alejandro\n  | title = ''Burn Something Beautiful''\n  | publisher = [[Fantasy Records]] and [[Concord Music Group]]\n  | date = 2016\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite news\n  | url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/kot/ct-alejandro-escovedopeter-buck-ott-1118-20161114-column.html\n  | work=[[Chicago Tribune]]\n  | title=Alejandro Escovedo: Rock bottom, then rebirth\n  | author=Kot, Greg\n  | date=November 16, 2016\n  | accessdate=February 26, 2017| author-link=Greg Kot\n }}</ref><ref>{{cite news\n  | url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/ct-alejandro-escovedo-city-winery-review-ent-0128-20170127-story.html\n  | work=Chicago Tribune\n  | title=Alejandro Escovedo brings energy, rawness to City Winery set\n  | author=Gendron, Bob\n  | date=January 27, 2017 \n  | accessdate=February 26, 2017\n}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Singles & EPs===\n*''The Minus Five \u2013 A Hello selection Dec.'93 \u2013 Jan.'94.''

Buck had moved to the Seattle area in 1992; the other principals were longtime fixtures of the Seattle music scene.  The four musicians had numerous personal and professional connections: both the Posies and McCaughey's [[Young Fresh Fellows|The Young Fresh Fellows]] had recorded at [[Conrad Uno]]'s Egg Studios and released albums on Uno's [[PopLlama|PopLlama Records]] label.  The Young Fresh Fellows and The Posies were fixtures of Seattle's [[Crocodile Cafe]], owned and managed by Buck's then-girlfriend (later wife) Stephanie Dorgan.  The Young Fresh Fellows were the opening band at a [[Kevn Kinney]] gig at the Croc On July 4, 1992; Buck backed Kinney along with R.E.M.'s [[Mike Mills]] and [[Bill Berry]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Scanlon|first1=Tom|title=R.E.M.'s Peter Buck: talking about the passion|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20020709&slug=buck09|website=Seattle Times|accessdate=21 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=1992/93/94 Concert Chronology|url=http://remtimeline.com/1992.html|website=R.E.M. Timeline|accessdate=21 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe band's name is a nod to classic-rock quintets such as [[The Count Five]], [[MC5]] and [[The Dave Clark Five]] and part of a trend of intentionally-misnamed groups such as [[Ben Folds Five]] and [[Pizzicato Five]] which had fewer than five members.  The use of a [[negative number]] in the band name is typical of the self-deprecating humor pervasive in the then grunge-saturated Seattle music scene.\n\nThe song titles of the group's earliest output\u2014among them, \"Loser So Supreme,\" \"Drunkard's Lullaby,\" and \"Brotherhood Of Pain\"\u2014are indicative of the downbeat nature of the band's initial output.  Themes of [[alcoholism]], [[death]], and [[self-hatred]] are recurrent in each subsequent Minus 5 release.  \"McCaughey realized he had a dumptruck-load of songs that the Young Fresh Fellows would either never get around to, or would wisely choose not to,\" read one press release. \"[Buck, Stringfellow and Auer] were quick to volunteer to help Scott capture his 'Let The Bad Times Roll' vision.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://billions.com/theminus5|title=The Minus 5|website=Billions.com|accessdate=21 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Hello Recording Club EP ===\nThe band assembled at Uno's Egg Studio in summer 1993 and recorded their debut EP for the [[Hello CD of the Month Club]], a subscription-only mail order club run by [[John Flansburgh]] of [[They Might Be Giants]].  For this EP the band were supplemented by [[NRBQ]] members Tom Ardolino and Terry Adams and Young Fresh Fellows bassist Jim Sangster.  McCaughey's darkly humorous lyrics and [[minor key]] compositions meshed seamlessly with Buck's bright guitar hooks.  The band's aesthetic is defined by opener \"Loser So Supreme,\" which pairs the chiming mandolin licks Buck popularized on \"[[Losing My Religion]]\" with downbeat observations like \"No one can reveal what has always been revealed/No one can invent a world that already exists.\"  Auer and Stringfellow, known more for their power-pop inflected [[Vocal harmony|vocal harmonies]] and [[guitar solo]]s, added [[Cacophony|cacophonous]] textures on piano, keyboards and guitar.\n\nFor this release only the band's name was stylized as 'The Minus Five'; all subsequent releases have used a numeral.  The EP was sent to subscribers as the December 1993/January 1994 release.<ref>{{cite book|last1=The Minus Five|title=The Minus Five|date=Dec 1993|publisher=Hello Recording Club}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Minus Five: The Minus Five|url=https://www.discogs.com/Minus-Five-The-The-Minus-Five/release/1056080|website=Discogs.com|accessdate=21 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Live debut and 1994 recording sessions ===\nThe Minus 5 made their live debut at the Crocodile Cafe on November 9, 1993 on a bill supporting jangly indie heroes The Silos.  As Auer and Stringfellow were in Europe touring behind the Posies' [[Frosting On The Beater]], the Minus 5 performed as a duo with backing from The Silos' [[Walter Salas-Humara]], [[Tom Freund]] and Manuel Versoza for the last three songs.  The set included lively covers of Johnny Cash's \"I Still Miss Someone\" and Neil Young's \"Barstool Blues\" as well as four freshly-written McCaughey compositions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://remtimeline.com/1992.html|title=1992/93/94 Concert Chronology|website=R.E.M. Timeline|accessdate=21 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nAt the time, it was widely assumed that the Minus 5 was a one-off proposition that might not record again, and certainly never tour due to the primary obligations of the principal musicians.  However, McCaughey continued to record at various Seattle studios including Egg, Down In The Hole and Private Radio throughout 1994. [[NRBQ]]'s Ardolino and Adams contributed to two more cuts; [[The Walkabouts]]' Carla Torgerson and Chris Eckman added cello and guitar; legendary Seattle street performer Richard Peterson played various horns.  McCaughey also recorded Young Fresh Fellows' ''Temptation On A Saturday'' EP during this period using some of the same musicians.\n\nDue to recording duties on R.E.M.'s [[Monster (R.E.M. album)|''Monster'']], Buck was away from Seattle for much of 1994, returning only briefly for the birth of his twin daughters.  When mixing on R.E.M.'s album was complete, Buck turned his attention to McCaughey's new songs.  The Minus 5 played their second show at the Crocodile Cafe on September 15, 1994, just a week before ''Monster''<nowiki/>'s release.  For this gig McCaughey, Buck and Stringfellow were joined by The Model Rockets' John Ramberg.\n\nBy fall 1994, McCaughey was caught up in the promotional blitz behind ''Monster'', making his live debut with R.E.M. on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' November 12, 1994.  McCaughey was subsequently recruited to join R.E.M. on their worldwide tour which kicked off in January 1995.\n\nThe Minus 5's cover of Johnny Cash's \"I Still Miss Someone\" was released on a 1994 German compilation titled ''Love Is My Only Crime \u2013 Part Two''.  The CD also featured rare or previously unreleased songs from The Young Fresh Fellows and future McCaughey collaborator [[Steve Wynn (musician)|Steve Wynn]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Various-Love-Is-My-Only-Crime-Part-Two/release/1435046|title=Various \u2013 Love Is My Only Crime \u2013 Part Two|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2017-11-24}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Old Liquidator'' ===\nIn April 1995, R.E.M. drummer [[Bill Berry]] suffered a [[brain aneurysm]], causing more than two months of planned tour dates to be abruptly cancelled.  In the unexpected downtime, McCaughey and Buck put the finishing touches on what would become the Minus 5's debut LP\u2014at the time titled ''Last Call, Corporal.''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Minus-5-Last-Call-Corporal/release/6197409|title=The Minus 5 \u2013 Last Call, Corporal|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2017-11-22}}</ref>\n\nThe finished product, hastily retitled ''[[Old Liquidator]]'', was at first a hard-to-find, low-key release on German indie label Glitterhouse.  Though pressed in modest numbers and at first only available in the U.S. as an import, the cache of being an 'R.E.M. side project' in 1995 was an irresistible lure to thirsty collectors.  It wasn't long before Minneapolis distributor [[East Side Digital Records|East Side Digital]] released the album in the U.S. as well.\n\n''Old Liquidator'' is haunted by the unexpected Christmas 1994 death of McCaughey's friend Jimmy Silva, who had collaborated with Young Fresh Fellows, Stringfellow, Uno and members of [[The Smithereens]].  \"Worse,\" the second track on the album, was co-written with Silva.  Other cuts such as \"Story\" are influenced by the surrealist imagery of mid-60s Bob Dylan, invoking fictional misadventures of figures including [[Franz Kafka]].\n\nAnother inspiration is [[Nick Lowe]], whose obscure 1979 B-side \"Basing Street\" is smothered here in the squealing distortion Buck patented on \"[[Country Feedback]].\"  Elsewhere, Buck's exotic bouzouki and dulcimer textures proved welcome departures from ''Monster''<nowiki/>'s fuzzed-out glam riffs. [[The Byrds]]-influenced [[Rickenbacker]] jangle of single \"Emperor Of The Bathroom\" is unmistakably Buck.  Auer and Stringfellow are more tangible on this album, harmonizing amiably on opener \"Winter Goes Away\" and closing singalong \"When It Comes My Way.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Old Liquidator|last=The Minus 5|publisher=East Side Digital Records|year=1995|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n''Old Liquidator'' begins The Minus 5's custom of numbering their releases, including singles, in [[Chronology|chronological order.]]  On the back cover, the subtitle \"The Minus 5 No. 2 Record\" is prominently displayed above the musicians' names.\n\nA CD single for \"[[The Emperor of the Bathroom|The Emperor Of The Bathroom]]\" was released in fall 1995 with alternate versions of three album cuts, a country-fried outtake called \"Heartache For Sale\" and a cover of the Fantastic Baggys' \"This Little Woody.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Emperor Of The Bathroom|last=The Minus 5|publisher=East Side Digital Records|year=1995|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nWhen the ''Monster'' tour resumed in summer 1995, R.E.M. began recording what would later become the [[New Adventures in Hi-Fi|''New Adventures In Hi-Fi'']] album using recordings of new songs made in concert, at soundchecks, in dressing rooms and even on the tour bus.  McCaughey, again called along for the ride, contributed significantly to these recordings playing piano, organ, synths and autoharp.\n\nBetween R.E.M. gigs on June 1, 1995, The Minus 5 played their first show outside of Seattle at the [[Lounge Ax]] in Chicago.  Without Auer and Stringfellow, Buck and McCaughey were supported by [[Wilco]] frontman [[Jeff Tweedy]], R.E.M. bassist [[Mike Mills]], and Mark Greenberg.  New songs \"Moonshine Girl\" and \"Wouldn't Want To Care\" were debuted alongside Johnny Cash, Nick Lowe, Gram Parsons and Porter Wagoner covers.\n\nDuring another tour hiatus, The Minus 5 played gigs at the Tractor Tavern and Crocodile Cafe in Seattle at the end of August 1995.  New song \"Bullfight\" was debuted at these shows, which featured [[The Young Fresh Fellows|Young Fresh Fellows]] and [[Fastbacks]] guitarist [[Kurt Bloch]] in addition to McCaughey, Buck and Auer.\n\nIn December 1995, The Minus 5 played two nights at the Crocodile Cafe in support of Kevn Kinney, supplemented by [[Screaming Trees]]' [[Barrett Martin]] on upright bass.  The Minus 5 and Kevn Kinney also played at the Aladdin Theater in Portland as The Barrett Martin Quartet.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://remtimeline.com/1995.html|title=1995 Concert Chronology|website=R.E.M. Timeline|access-date=2017-11-22}}</ref>\n\n=== Hollywood Records deal and ''The Lonesome Death of Buck McCoy'' ===\nThe modest success of ''Old Liquidator'' and continued cultural cache of R.E.M. brought The Minus 5 a great deal of attention in 1996.  Not only were the group signed to [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]-affiliated [[Hollywood Records]], but the label agreed to finance a follow-up record and even reissue some of McCaughey's back catalog.  Moreover, McCaughey was given his own label imprint, Malt Records, with distribution through Hollywood.\n\nThough the bulk of recording for ''New Adventures In Hi-Fi'' had taken place on the road, Buck was occupied through early 1996 with recording and mixing the new [[R.E.M.]] album.  Nonetheless, McCaughey and Buck continued to record in piecemeal sessions with [[Avast! Recording Company|Avast!]] engineer Kevin Suggs, Conrad Uno, [[John Keane (record producer)|John Keane]], and Water Music's Rob Grenoble.  In late summer, The Minus 5 played [[KISW]]'s Pain In The Grass concert in support of [[The Posies]], who were busy touring behind their 1996 release ''[[Amazing Disgrace]]''.  New songs \"Cross Every Line\" and \"Empty Room\" were premiered by a lineup including McCaughey, Buck, Auer, Stringfellow and John Ramberg.\n\n''New Adventures In Hi-Fi'' was released September 10, 1996.  With no tour planned to promote the album, Buck was free to explore other musical pursuits.  In early fall 1996, Buck embarked on two new musical collaborations: the instrumental supergroup [[Tuatara (band)|Tuatara]] with Barrett Martin, and a collaborative album with [[American Music Club]]'s [[Mark Eitzel]].  Martin joined the Minus 5 for a Crocodile Cafe gig on October 7, 1996 where new songs \"Hate Me More\" and \"Dear Employer (The Reason I Quit\") were debuted. McCaughey's then-wife [[Christy McWilson]] also joined the group for this show.  The following week, Tuatara made their live debut at the Croc.\n\nIn December 1996, Buck booked a week with engineer Ed Brooks at Ironwood in Seattle to record Eitzel's [[West (Mark Eitzel album)|''West'']] album.  McCaughey, Martin, and [[Pearl Jam]]'s [[Mike McCready]] were all on hand for the sessions.  At the end of the sessions, The Minus 5 opened for Eitzel at the Crocodile Cafe.  Martin and Eitzel both joined The Minus 5 for several songs and McCaughey premiered new song \"Boeing Spacearium.\"  The second Minus 5 full-length, dubbed ''[[The Lonesome Death of Buck McCoy]]'', was completed at Ironwood shortly thereafter.\n\n''The Lonesome Death of Buck McCoy'', cobbled together from McCaughey's many 1996 sessions, featured an impressive roster of guests including [[Guided by Voices]]' [[Robert Pollard]], [[The Presidents of the United States of America (band)|The Presidents of the United States of America]], McWilson, Barrett Martin and Mike McCready.  Unlike previous releases, each song was credited equally to McCaughey and Buck.  In the liner notes each player was assigned a \"role\" as in a rock opera, with McCaughey himself playing \"Buck McCoy\" and others assuming roles like \"Admiral Boot,\" \"The Constable\" and \"Ancient Roomer.\"  In reference to the creative process of the album, the liner notes provide a synopsis:  \"Little Buck McCoy wakes up born in the middle of a wheatfield. He decides to carry on alone, despite his many acquaintances, until dying years later.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Lonesome Death of Buck McCoy|last=The Minus 5|publisher=Hollywood Records|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nThe songs did not actually constitute a narrative or refer to these characters at all.  Critics took note of the haphazard nature of the proceedings, which included Small Faces pastiche \"Popsycle Shoppe\" and a cover of [[John Lennon]]'s harrowing \"My Mummy's Dead.\" [[No Depression (magazine)|No Depression]] called the album \"Surprisingly bitter froth...Most of the record's 12 songs quake with the severely compressed intimacy and hazy chamber-ballad tension of recent R.E.M. (no surprise) and John Lennon.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nodepression.com/album-review/minus-5-lonesome-death-buck-mccoy|title=Minus 5 \u2013 The Lonesome Death Of Buck McCoy|date=1997-06-30|work=No Depression|access-date=2017-11-24}}</ref>  Hollywood Records did not release a single to promote the album.\n\n=== The Magnificent Seven vs. The United States tour ===\nIn early 1997, R.E.M. began the process of writing demos for a new album both in [[Athens, Georgia|Athens]] in February and Buck's Hawaiian residence in April.  The three albums Buck had contributed to in 1996 were all released within weeks of one another. Tuatara's [[Breaking the Ethers|''Breaking The Ethers'']] was released March 1, 1997, followed by Eitzel's [[West (Mark Eitzel album)|''West'']] and ''[[The Lonesome Death of Buck McCoy]]'' on the same day: May 5, 1997.  A U.S. tour was assembled that would allow Buck to tour both coasts with all three acts, under the title ''The Magnificent Seven vs. The United States.''  The Magnificent Seven referred to McCaughey, Stringfellow, Eitzel, Martin and the three remaining members of Tuatara\u2014though counting Buck there were actually eight.  American Music Club bassist Dan Pearson later joined the tour to augment Eitzel's sets.  For this tour The Minus 5 consisted of Buck, McCaughey, Stringfellow, Martin, and Tuatara's [[Justin Harwood]].\n\nThe tour kicked off May 1, 1997 with two hometown gigs at the Crocodile.  Each show featured Tuatara and Eitzel performing two sets each, with a short Minus 5 set between and occasionally McCaughey performing solo.  The 22-date tour continued for two months, with many media appearances along the way.  Buck and Eitzel performed on [[KNBR-FM|KFOG]] in San Francisco, [[Late Night with Conan O'Brien|Late Night With Conan O'Brien]] and then on [[WBCN (FM)|WBCN]] radio in Boston.  All three groups played [[Morning Becomes Eclectic]] on [[KCRW]] in Santa Monica and [[Vin Scelsa|Idiot's Delight]] on [[WNEW-FM|WNEW]] in New York.  Near the end of the tour all three groups played a free in-store at New York record mecca [[Other Music]].\n\nThe East Coast leg of the tour was peppered with surprise guests: [[Pearl Jam]]'s [[Mike McCready]] and [[John Wesley Harding (singer)|John Wesley Harding]] showed up in New York, [[Mike Mills]] joined The Minus 5 in Philadelphia and Atlanta, and [[Michael Stipe]] joined his R.E.M. bandmates for a four-song encore in Atlanta.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://remtimeline.com/1996.html|title=1996/97/98 Concert Chronology|website=R.E.M. Timeline|access-date=2017-11-24}}</ref>\n\nReaction to the tour was mixed.  None of the three records sold particularly well, and the critics' approval was tepid:  \"A three-hour marathon that was simply too much to absorb,\" Sara Scribner wrote in the [[Los Angeles Times]]. \"The Minus 5, despite some catchy, jangling tunes from its new album...never got its footing.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997-05-16/entertainment/ca-59194_1_peter-buck|title=Peter Buck Splinters Into a Three-Band Musical Circus Act|last=SCRIBNER|first=SARA|date=1997-05-16|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-11-24|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}</ref> [[Geoffrey Himes]] wrote in [[The Washington Post]]: \"Genuinely amusing when the tunes were bouncy and catchy, but the slow numbers didn't have the humor or melody to justify the dreary pacing.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1997/05/31/the-magnificent-seven-buck-stops-here/eb0f4433-1f6c-4e83-9073-5bd24c0e5f8a/|title=THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN: BUCK STOPS HERE|last=Himes|first=Geoffrey|date=1997-05-31|work=Washington Post|access-date=2017-11-24|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1997, Buck recorded some tracks with [[Robyn Hitchcock]] for his album [[Jewels for Sophia|Jewels For Sophia]] in Seattle.  After the session, McCaughey joined Hitchcock and Buck for a Crocodile Cafe gig under the name \"Popscyle Shoppe Incident: Viva Sea Tac II.\" [[Tim Keegan]] and Kurt Bloch joined in the set, and Young Fresh Fellows were the opening act.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://remtimeline.com/1996.html|title=1996/97/98 Concert Chronology|website=R.E.M. Timeline|access-date=2017-11-24}}</ref>\n\n=== Hollywood Records deluxe reissues ===\nIn August 1997, Hollywood Records reissued ''[[Old Liquidator]]'' and, curiously, McCaughey's 1989 solo album ''[[My Chartreuse Opinion]]'' in deluxe editions with bonus tracks.  ''My Chartreuse Opinion'', a Conrad Uno-recorded affair which featured cameos from Jimmy Silva and Christy McWilson, was now credited to \"The Minus 5 of Scott McCaughey.\"  The reissue actually featured fewer bonus tracks than the now out-of-print original release, which featured four unrelated Silva recordings at the end.  Nonetheless, it was a great way of drawing attention to McCaughey's back catalog and much easier to find than the initial release.  ''Old Liquidator'' was also expanded, adding two songs from the Hello Recording Club EP, \"Heartache For Sale\" from the \"Emperor of the Bathroom\" single, and two short instrumentals.<ref>{{Cite book|title=My Chartreuse Opinion|last=The Minus 5|publisher=Hollywood Records|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Old Liquidator|last=The Minus 5|publisher=Hollywood Records|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nThese would prove to be The Minus 5's final releases on Hollywood.  Just weeks before the release of ''The Lonesome Death of Buck McCoy'', longtime Hollywood Records president Bob Pfeifer resigned.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1997-04-17/news/9704180160_1_calif-based-disney-pfeifer-musician-and-talent-scout|title=Head of struggling Disney music unit quits: Walt Disney...|work=Chicago Tribune|access-date=2017-11-26|language=en}}</ref>  Under a reorganization plan, Disney acquired established indie [[Mammoth Records]] for $25 million in an attempt to diversify its roster.  Mammoth founder [[Jay Faires]] was now charged with breaking The Minus 5 to a larger audience, but industry watchers such as [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'s Adam Sandler questioned why Disney didn't focus on \"pop music, which is a better fit with its TV and film programming, rather than indie-inspired repertoire.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/1997/music/news/disney-inks-mammoth-deal-1116676444/|title=Disney inks Mammoth deal|last=Sandler|first=Adam|date=1997-07-22|work=Variety|access-date=2017-11-26|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== McCaughey joins R.E.M. and Tuatara in the studio ===\nWhile R.E.M. was in Georgia recording demos for what would become [[Up (R.E.M. album)|''Up'']], The Minus 5 played its first two shows without Buck: at Chicago's Lounge Ax on August 16, 1997 the band consisted of McCaughey, Stringfellow, [[Jason Finn (musician)|Jason Finn]] and [[Dharma Bums (band)|Dharma Bums]]' Jim Talstra.  The raucous gig was by far the band's longest to date: an 11-song McCaughey solo set followed by a 22-song Minus 5 powerhouse that included unreleased songs, several nuggets from ''My Chartreuse Opinion'' and covers of John Lennon and [[The Modern Lovers]].  The following week, McCaughey played a gig with John Wesley Harding at the Croc in Seattle which included a handful of Minus 5 tunes and as-yet-unreleased Young Fresh Fellows songs.\n\nIn October 1997, Bill Berry announced he was leaving R.E.M.  Having completed more than eight months of writing and recording demos for ''Up'', R.E.M. made the decision to continue as a three-piece.  As the recording process continued in 1998, McCaughey became an important contributor in the studio, usually on keyboards.  Ken Stringfellow and Barrett Martin were also recruited for some of these sessions.  McCaughey was also roped into Tuatara in 1998, contributing three tracks to sophomore album ''[[Trading with the Enemy|Trading With The Enemy]]''.\n\nNear the end of 1997, The Minus 5 played the two-night Crocodile Cafe's An Evenings In Edenbrook Forest event, with a lineup that included McCaughey, Buck, Martin and John Ramberg.  A special double CD compilation was given away at the shows which included The Minus 5's cover of The Modern Lovers' \"Government Center\" and rare or unreleased cuts from Young Fresh Fellows, The Lowe Beats (McCaughey's Nick Lowe cover band), The Model Rockets, Fastbacks and others.  The CD was the inaugural release of Book Records, a new label McCaughey started for extremely limited or tour-only releases.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Various-An-Evenings-In-Edenbrook-Forest/release/5072737|title=Various \u2013 An Evenings In Edenbrook Forest|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2017-11-24}}</ref>\n\nIn 1999, the group accepted an invitation to participate in a [[tribute album]] to [[Moby Grape]] co-founder [[Skip Spence]], who was terminally ill with cancer, for the purpose of raising funds to assist with medical expenses.<ref>See ''[[More Oar: A Tribute to the Skip Spence Album]]''.</ref>\n\nSince McCaughey had made The Minus 5 his primary musical outlet, new material from The Young Fresh Fellows had slowed to a trickle.  In 1994 and 1995 the group had released three singles and an EP.  Nonetheless, McCaughey often recorded new songs with the Fellows and by summer 1999, had enough to release as an album.  ''A Tribute To Music'' was released on Spanish indie label Rock and Roll Inc. and never released in the U.S.  Though most of the tracks were originals, the Fellows made an unremarkable pass at R.E.M.'s rocker \"Circus Envy\" on the LP.  Considered a minor release by both fans and critics, ''A Tribute To Music'' left many wondering if McCaughey was saving his best tunes for his other band.  \"There's a tossed-off feeling to the record,\" Bart Bealmear wrote for [[AllMusic]]. \"[Most of the songs] are missing the group's unique mix of humor, energy, spirit, and melody.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/a-tribute-to-music-mw0000949235|title=A Tribute to Music \u2013 The Young Fresh Fellows|website=AllMusic|access-date=2017-11-27}}</ref>\n\n=== ''In Rock'' ===\nOn January 9, 2000 The Minus 5 played a secret show at Lounge Ax in Chicago, opening for Wilco (billed as \"Summer Teeth\") for 300 lucky fans.  This was a farewell gig as the beloved [[Lincoln Park, Chicago|Lincoln Park]] venue would shut its doors just one week later.  For this gig the Minus 5 was just McCaughey fronting Wilco, with frontman Jeff Tweedy playing bass.  The group raced through a handful of brand-new, unrehearsed songs alongside covers of influences as diverse as Mott The Hoople, Johnny Cash and Neutral Milk Hotel.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nodepression.com/live-review/last-days-lounge-ax-lounge-ax-chicago-il|title=Last Days At Lounge Ax \u2013 Lounge Ax (Chicago, IL)|date=2000-02-29|work=No Depression|access-date=2017-11-27}}</ref>\n\nA few weeks later (January 20) a more conventional Minus 5 lineup (McCaughey, Buck, Ramberg, Chris Ballew and R.E.M. session drummer [[Bill Rieflin]]) premiered eight of these new songs at the Crocodile Cafe back in Seattle.  John Wesley Harding and Kurt Block sat in on a few numbers.\n\nIn early February McCaughey and Stringfellow joined R.E.M. in Georgia to record instrumental demos for the [[Reveal (R.E.M. album)|''Reveal'']] album.  On February 25, McCaughey, Buck, Ramberg and Rieflin played another Minus 5 gig at the Crocodile, premiering new tracks \"Over The Sea\" and \"Beyond The Sea\" alongside more recent compositions.\n\nOn March 13, 2000 McCaughey assembled a skeleton crew of himself, Buck, Ramberg and R.E.M. session drummer [[Bill Rieflin]] at Jupiter Studios in Seattle and recorded ten of his latest compositions in one day.  The session included spirited takes on the [[Nightcrawlers (band)|Nightcrawlers]]' [[Power pop|power-pop]] anthem \"[[The Little Black Egg]]\", an ode to the demise of the Lounge Ax (\"The Night Chicago Died (The Death of The Minus 5)\") and even a tribute to [[Dr. Evil]], the villain in the [[Austin Powers (film series)|''Austin Powers'']] film series.\n\nOn April 25, 2000 The Minus 5 played another Croc show with a lineup of McCaughey, Buck, Stringfellow, Ramberg and Barrett Martin.  John Wesley Harding, [[Sean Nelson]] and [[The Long Winters]]' [[John Roderick (musician)|John Roderick]] sat in on the set, which included [[Bee Gees]], [[Paul McCartney and Wings|Wings]] and [[The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]] covers.  The Minus 5 returned to the Croc on June 8 with McCaughey, Buck, Ramberg, Rieflin and John Wesley Harding playing a set which included some improvised one-off songs, [[Faces (band)|Faces]] and [[Paul McCartney]] covers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://remtimeline.com/2000.html|title=2000/01 Concert Chronology|website=R.E.M. Timeline|access-date=2017-11-27}}</ref>\n\nDespite a rigorous recording schedule for R.E.M. with sessions in Georgia and [[Dublin|Dublin, Ireland]], Buck was nonetheless available for Minus 5 gigs on July 7 at Tractor Tavern at September 2 at Bumbershoot Festival at [[Memorial Stadium (Seattle)|Memorial Stadium]].  The Minus 5 were a last-minute replacement for a band that dropped out of the fest and for this show consisted of McCaughey, Buck, Ramberg, John Wesley Harding, Robert Lloyd (of Harding's band) and members of the [[The Walkabouts|Walkabouts]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.universaltrendsetter.org/Gigography.htm|title=Gigography|website=UniversalTrendsetter.org|access-date=2017-11-27}}</ref>\n\nMcCaughey pressed 1,000 copies of the March session as a surprise album, titled ''[[In Rock (The Minus 5 album)|In Rock]]''. Because it was made as a limited-edition, tour-only CD McCaughey released it on his Book label.  The CD was only available at Minus 5 shows at first, though it was later sold through the R.E.M. fanclub.  The CD was sold for the first time at an October 14, 2000 Crocodile Cafe show with McCaughey, Buck, Stringfellow, Ramberg and Rieflin.  A [[The Sonics|Sonics]] cover band (The New Original Sonic Sound) featuring members of [[Mudhoney]], Tuatara, and [[Gas Huffer]] with McCaughey on keyboards also played.\n\nIn October 2000 McCaughey and Stringfellow returned to Georgia to record with R.E.M.  During the sessions, McCaughey, Stringfellow and Mike Mills joined local group [[The Possibilities]] for a loose set that included [[Neil Young]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Chris Bell (American musician)|Chris Bell]], [[Joni Mitchell]] and [[Gram Parsons]] covers.  The Minus 5's cover of the band's \"You Don't Mean It\" would be released as a radio single just a few months later.\n\nThe Minus 5 closed out an eventful year with a Croc set on December 8, 2000 with the lineup of McCaughey, Buck, Ramberg, and Rieflin with guests John Wesley Harding, Sean Nelson, Britt Speakman, Carla Tongerson and Peter Blackstock.  A number of new songs were debuted at this show including \"A Thousand Years Away\" and \"You Don't Mean It.\"\n\n=== ''Let the War Against Music Begin'' ===\nIn 2001, the Minus Five and the [[Young Fresh Fellows]], another McCaughey project, released a split double album, ''Let the War Against Music Begin/Because We Hate You''; the \"Let the War Against Music Begin\" half was the Minus 5 submission.\n\nAfter a change of guard at [[Hollywood Records]], the Minus 5 found themselves releasing music via independent channels, with the Return to Sender label releasing a collection of outtakes from ''Let the War Against Music Begin'' called ''I Don't Know Who I Am'' before McCaughey signed the band to the [[Yep Roc]] label for his collaboration with [[Wilco]], ''Down With Wilco''. Yep Roc later issued an EP dominated by ''Down With Wilco'' outtakes, ''At the Organ'', and reissued ''In Rock'', a collection of tunes McCaughey recorded in a single day in 2000.\n\nIn 2002, the band contributed a track, \"Girl I Never Met\" to Rami Jaffee, Pete Yorn, and Marc Dauer's Trampoline Records release: Trampoline Records Volume I.\n\nThe band's seventh album, self-titled (but known as ''The Gun Album''), was released early 2006, and features, along the regular line-up, guest appearances by [[Wilco]], [[Kelly Hogan]] and [[The Decemberists]]' singer/songwriter [[Colin Meloy]], among others.\n\nBuck and McCaughey went on to play in [[The Baseball Project]] together in 2008.\n[[File:Peter Buck & Scott McCaughey.jpg|alt=Buck and McCaughey playing guitar|thumb|Buck and McCaughey playing with The Baseball Project/The Minus 5/Steve Wynn IV in 2009]]\nThe Minus 5 appeared on [[John Wesley Harding (singer)|John Wesley Harding]]'s 2009 release, ''[[Who Was Changed and Who Was Dead]]'' and released ''[[Killingsworth (album)|Killingsworth]]'' later that year.\n\nIn 2012 recorded a version of the 1976 hit single by the [[Sutherland Brothers]] and Quiver \"[[Arms of Mary]]\" for a fund raising CD titled \"Super Hits Of The Seventies\" for radio station [[WFMU]].  The band played at [[SXSW]] in 2013.\n\nIn January 2017 The Minus 5 joined [[Alejandro Escovedo]] for a short tour.  For each concert [[Scott McCaughey]], [[Kurt Bloch]], [[Peter Buck]], and [[John Moen]] played one set as the Minus Five, and then a second set backing Escovedo, sometimes with [[Kelly Hogan]], too.  All of them had also performed on Escovedo's 2016 album ''[[Burn Something Beautiful]]'', for which Escovedo, McCaughey, and Buck co-wrote the songs.<ref name=\"BurnBeautiful\">{{citation \n  | author = Escovedo, Alejandro\n  | title = ''Burn Something Beautiful''\n  | publisher = [[Fantasy Records]] and [[Concord Music Group]]\n  | date = 2016\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite news\n  | url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/kot/ct-alejandro-escovedopeter-buck-ott-1118-20161114-column.html\n  | work=[[Chicago Tribune]]\n  | title=Alejandro Escovedo: Rock bottom, then rebirth\n  | author=Kot, Greg\n  | date=November 16, 2016\n  | accessdate=February 26, 2017| author-link=Greg Kot\n }}</ref><ref>{{cite news\n  | url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/ct-alejandro-escovedo-city-winery-review-ent-0128-20170127-story.html\n  | work=Chicago Tribune\n  | title=Alejandro Escovedo brings energy, rawness to City Winery set\n  | author=Gendron, Bob\n  | date=January 27, 2017 \n  | accessdate=February 26, 2017\n}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Singles & EPs===\n*''The Minus Five \u2013 A Hello selection Dec.'93 \u2013 Jan.'94.''

It consisted of 28 episodes, giving the series a total of 49 episodes thus far. [[Caroline Sunshine]] was added to the main cast this season.\n\n==Production and release==\nOn March 16, 2011, the series was picked up for its second season. A few months later, it was announced that the series would begin with a one-hour special episode and that it would be aired later that fall. Production for the season filmed from July 2011 to March 2012. The second season officially premiered on September 18, 2011, but the one-hour special episode did not premiere as planned due to episodes being shown out of order. [[Disney Channel]] ordered the season to have 26 episodes, but it actually had 28 episodes. On August 17, 2012, the series concluded with a 90-minute special episode called \"Shake It Up: Made In Japan.\" Showrunner and executive producer [[Chris Thompson (TV producer)|Chris Thompson]] had left before the second season, so executive producer [[Rob Lotterstein]] took Thompson's place as showrunner and Jeff Strauss joined Lotterstein as executive producers. [[Eileen Conn]] remained in her role as co-executive producer, but became executive producer with Lotterstein and Strauss in the season finale. David Holden replaced John D. Beck, Ron Hart, Ron Zimmerman, and Howard J. Morris as consulting producer.\n\n==Synopsis==\nCeCe and Rocky discover issues in their friendship. Throughout the season, they're usually arguing and things start to get out of hand on ''Shake It Up, Chicago''. Other things include Rocky and CeCe trying to step up their game by getting even more famous beyond their gigs on the show. The show starts to fall apart all throughout the season.

The next day, Rocky still doesn't believe CeCe's project will work, but when both of their projects are tested, Rocky's doesn't work and CeCe's is successful. Rocky apologizes to CeCe and shows her that some discoveries happen by accident. Meanwhile, Flynn is mad at Ty for ignoring him at Crusty's, so he fires Ty as his babysitter and replaces him with Gunther. Gunther and Ty then compete to see who is the better babysitter. When they find out Flynn tricked them into doing his essay for him, they retaliate by writing his essay with false information.<ref>[http://www.thefutoncritic.com/listings/20111229disney18/ ROCKY FINDS A NEW PARTNER IN A NEW EPISODE OF \"SHAKE IT UP,\" SUNDAY, JANUARY 22 ON DISNEY CHANNEL]</ref>\n\n''Guest star'': [[Joel Brooks]] as Mr. Polk\n\n''Songs Featured'': \"The Night Is Young\" by Wild Thingz\n\n''Note'': This is the second episode where Gunther appears without Tinka.\n\n''Absent'': Adam Irigoyen as Deuce Martinez, Caroline Sunshine as Tinka Hessenheffer \n |LineColor= FFD522\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Shake It Up (season 2)\n |EpisodeNumber= 36\n |EpisodeNumber2= 15\n |Title= Judge It Up\n |DirectedBy= Ellen Gittelsohn\n |WrittenBy= Eileen Conn\n |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|2012|3|11}}\n |ProdCode= 214\n |Aux4= 3.3 <ref>[http://www.thefutoncritic.com/ratings/2012/03/13/sundays-cable-ratings-walking-dead-still-unstoppable-for-amc-542412/cable_20120311/ Ratings \u2013 Sunday's Cable Ratings: \"Walking Dead\" Still Unstoppable for AMC | TheFutonCritic.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n |ShortSummary = When Gunther and Tinka refuse to pay Rocky and CeCe their money for performing at Klaus's party, the girls take their case to \"Teen Court\". Gunther and Tinka claim Rocky and CeCe didn't perform well and they ruined Klaus's party. Gunther and Tinka also claim that they ate all the cake and yelled at Klaus. However, Rocky and CeCe think Gunther and Tinka ruined the party because they were so harsh to Klaus. Rocky and CeCe also claim that Tinka smashed the cake in Klaus's face. As soon as Judge Marsha is about to close the case, Deuce comes running in with a surveillance video from Crusty's. The video shows that all of them ruined Klaus's party, after smacking his birthday cake out of his hand by an accident. Later, Gunther and Tinka pay back the money to Rocky and CeCe as they promised, but with a slight catch: this time, they pay them back with pennies. Meanwhile, after finding out Flynn doesn't know how to ride a bike, Henry wants to teach him. Flynn is reluctant at first, but then, he sees how useful it is, and he wants to ride a bike.

The agent books them on an American adaptation of the Japanese game show ''Let's Get Weird'', where the girls believe they have been booked to be background dancers on the set of the show. However, the parts the agent had actually booked them for was the roles of the \"Weirdettes\", two female models who are the subject of the consequences of a contestant's incorrect answers. To make matters worse, the contestant competing in the taping of the show they are booked for is none other than Flynn, who auditioned for the show after bribing the girls' agent (who tipped him off about the gig) in order to get back at CeCe for constantly neglecting him in favor of hanging out with Rocky. The game show turns out to be a lot more twisted than it seems, as the girls are forced to suffer comical, yet disgusting punishments for Flynn intentionally answering the questions incorrectly. However, after CeCe finally apologizes for not spending time with him, Flynn has a change of heart and attempts to answer the final question correctly to win the grand prize for all three of them. Unfortunately, Flynn's final answer is incorrect, and as a result the girls are forced to be humiliated by having soggy gunk puked on them by two people in bird costumes. Meanwhile, Ty likes Gloria, a foreign exchange student who only speaks Spanish. Due to the language diversities, Ty asks Deuce to accompany him on the date as a translator. In the end, the girls get back at their lousy agent by hiring one of the costumed birds from the show to puke on him.\n\n''Guest stars'': Denyse Tontz as Gloria, [[David Shatraw]] as Host, Jerry Sroka as Agent\n\n''Absent'': Kenton Duty as Gunther Hessenheffer, Caroline Sunshine as Tinka Hessenheffer \n |LineColor= FFD522\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Shake It Up (season 2)\n |EpisodeNumber= 39\n |EpisodeNumber2= 18\n |Title= Whodunit Up?\n |DirectedBy= Joel Zwick\n |WrittenBy= [[Darin Henry]]\n |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|2012|4|15}}\n |ProdCode= 221<ref name=\"catalog\"/>\n |Aux4= 3.7<ref>[http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/04/17/cable-top-25-pawn-stars-swamp-people-and-legend-of-korra-top-cable-viewership-for-week-ending-april-15-2012/129415/ Cable Top 25: \u2018Pawn Stars\u2019, \u2018Swamp People\u2019 and \u2018Legend of Korra\u2019 Top Cable Viewership For Week Ending April 15, 2012 \u2013 Ratings | TVbytheNumbers<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n |ShortSummary = When a phantom threatens to shut down \"Shake It Up Chicago,\" CeCe, Rocky, Gunther, and Tinka try to unmask the culprit.

Back in the US, every state's show competed and Shake It Up, Chicago wins. They fly on a private jet to Japan, but CeCe takes Rocky to a hypnotist, Shelly, so Rocky can get over her fear of flying. While Rocky is still hypnotized, CeCe suggests that Shelly makes Rocky a fun and better person, which CeCe has to rub Rocky's shoulder and tell her to \"get on board, Rocky,\" which helps CeCe take advantage of her. Rocky, CeCe, Gunther, Tinka, Ty, Flynn, Gary, Georgia are all aboard the plane and Henry goes as well, which he brings his android, Andy. Ty also keeps in contact with Deuce through his tablet, in which Deuce acts like he is actually in Japan. As everyone arrives in Tokyo, Gunther and Tinka lose their luggage but buy new clothes. The four dancers go to the studios to be put in the game, and Mr. Watanabe's grandchildren make an app for the game before its released because of Rocky's suggestion to disobey Mr. Watanabe's order to not make it. After he finds out, Rocky tries to talk to him, but she makes him feel like he's wrong and then he ends up cancelling the game. Gary makes Mr. Watanabe put the game project back on, but on the circumstance, Rocky and CeCe are fired from Shake It Up Chicago. Later, everyone is kicked out of the suite and has to find their way back home. Later, Rocky answers CeCe's phone when Shelly calls, finding that CeCe has been taking advantage of her and they end their friendship. Meanwhile, Tinka is being deported back to the old country after hitting a security guard accidentally, but Rocky and CeCe convince the security guards to send Gunther and Tinka back to the US together. Afterwards, the app that the Watanabe grandchildren uploaded contained a virus that could go global and stop all computers, but Henry, who did not upload the app, attempts to fix it, but can't get past the firewall.

It consisted of 28 episodes, giving the series a total of 49 episodes thus far. [[Caroline Sunshine]] was added to the main cast this season.\n\n==Production and release==\nOn March 16, 2011, the series was picked up for its second season. A few months later, it was announced that the series would begin with a one-hour special episode and that it would be aired later that fall. Production for the season filmed from July 2011 to March 2012. The second season officially premiered on September 18, 2011, but the one-hour special episode did not premiere as planned due to episodes being shown out of order.

On August 17, 2012, the series concluded with a 90-minute special episode called \"Shake It Up: Made In Japan.\" Showrunner and executive producer [[Chris Thompson (TV producer)|Chris Thompson]] had left before the second season, so executive producer [[Rob Lotterstein]] took Thompson's place as showrunner and Jeff Strauss joined Lotterstein as executive producers.

Beck, Ron Hart, Ron Zimmerman, and Howard J. Morris as consulting producer.\n\n==Synopsis==\nCeCe and Rocky discover issues in their friendship. Throughout the season, they're usually arguing and things start to get out of hand on ''Shake It Up, Chicago''. Other things include Rocky and CeCe trying to step up their game by getting even more famous beyond their gigs on the show. The show starts to fall apart all throughout the season. In the meantime, Flynn becomes more interested in outdoor activities, like biking (which he doesn't know how to do as mentioned in \"Judge It Up\") and camping activities. Ty tries to begin his rapping career, but things go awry when he fails to have \"the proper rapping skills.\" Deuce gets a job at his uncle's restaurant \"Crusty's\" and develops relationship issues with Dina. Gunther and Tinka try to join in with the rest of the gang as they are usually bonding with the characters on certain events.\n\n==Opening sequence==\nThe opening theme starts with Rocky and CeCe dancing on the wing of an airplane (as shown in \"Shake It Up, Up, and Away\") doing a dance routine, then showing various clips of the cast members (some clips from season 1 are also included), starting off with [[Zendaya]] and [[Bella Thorne]], then going in order with [[Davis Cleveland]], [[Roshon Fegan]], [[Adam Irigoyen]], and [[Kenton Duty]]. [[Caroline Sunshine]] is now added to the opening credits with a few clips shown of her character.

At \"Good Morning, Chicago\", Rocky delivers some balloons to CeCe and the two share a hug. Rocky helps CeCe with some last minute touches before she performs, and they are both locked in the dressing room by the Hessenheffers. Meanwhile, Deuce and Flynn help Ty improve his rap skills.

Back at \"Good Morning, Chicago\", right as the Hessenheffers are about to perform, the host interrupts their dance with breaking news, which takes up the rest of the time, so Gunther and Tinka never get to dance.\n\n''Guest stars'': [[R.

Rocky tries to make it up to her by offering to do the whole project by herself and put CeCe's name on it, but CeCe would rather they do her project herself and is upset that Rocky underestimates her when it comes to school. The next day, Rocky still doesn't believe CeCe's project will work, but when both of their projects are tested, Rocky's doesn't work and CeCe's is successful.

The agent books them on an American adaptation of the Japanese game show ''Let's Get Weird'', where the girls believe they have been booked to be background dancers on the set of the show. However, the parts the agent had actually booked them for was the roles of the \"Weirdettes\", two female models who are the subject of the consequences of a contestant's incorrect answers. To make matters worse, the contestant competing in the taping of the show they are booked for is none other than Flynn, who auditioned for the show after bribing the girls' agent (who tipped him off about the gig) in order to get back at CeCe for constantly neglecting him in favor of hanging out with Rocky. The game show turns out to be a lot more twisted than it seems, as the girls are forced to suffer comical, yet disgusting punishments for Flynn intentionally answering the questions incorrectly. However, after CeCe finally apologizes for not spending time with him, Flynn has a change of heart and attempts to answer the final question correctly to win the grand prize for all three of them. Unfortunately, Flynn's final answer is incorrect, and as a result the girls are forced to be humiliated by having soggy gunk puked on them by two people in bird costumes. Meanwhile, Ty likes Gloria, a foreign exchange student who only speaks Spanish. Due to the language diversities, Ty asks Deuce to accompany him on the date as a translator. In the end, the girls get back at their lousy agent by hiring one of the costumed birds from the show to puke on him.\n\n''Guest stars'': Denyse Tontz as Gloria, [[David Shatraw]] as Host, Jerry Sroka as Agent\n\n''Absent'': Kenton Duty as Gunther Hessenheffer, Caroline Sunshine as Tinka Hessenheffer \n |LineColor= FFD522\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Shake It Up (season 2)\n |EpisodeNumber= 39\n |EpisodeNumber2= 18\n |Title= Whodunit Up?\n |DirectedBy= Joel Zwick\n |WrittenBy= [[Darin Henry]]\n |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|2012|4|15}}\n |ProdCode= 221<ref name=\"catalog\"/>\n |Aux4= 3.7<ref>[http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/04/17/cable-top-25-pawn-stars-swamp-people-and-legend-of-korra-top-cable-viewership-for-week-ending-april-15-2012/129415/ Cable Top 25: \u2018Pawn Stars\u2019, \u2018Swamp People\u2019 and \u2018Legend of Korra\u2019 Top Cable Viewership For Week Ending April 15, 2012 \u2013 Ratings | TVbytheNumbers<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n |ShortSummary = When a phantom threatens to shut down \"Shake It Up Chicago,\" CeCe, Rocky, Gunther, and Tinka try to unmask the culprit.

Back in the US, every state's show competed and Shake It Up, Chicago wins. They fly on a private jet to Japan, but CeCe takes Rocky to a hypnotist, Shelly, so Rocky can get over her fear of flying. While Rocky is still hypnotized, CeCe suggests that Shelly makes Rocky a fun and better person, which CeCe has to rub Rocky's shoulder and tell her to \"get on board, Rocky,\" which helps CeCe take advantage of her. Rocky, CeCe, Gunther, Tinka, Ty, Flynn, Gary, Georgia are all aboard the plane and Henry goes as well, which he brings his android, Andy. Ty also keeps in contact with Deuce through his tablet, in which Deuce acts like he is actually in Japan. As everyone arrives in Tokyo, Gunther and Tinka lose their luggage but buy new clothes. The four dancers go to the studios to be put in the game, and Mr. Watanabe's grandchildren make an app for the game before its released because of Rocky's suggestion to disobey Mr. Watanabe's order to not make it. After he finds out, Rocky tries to talk to him, but she makes him feel like he's wrong and then he ends up cancelling the game. Gary makes Mr. Watanabe put the game project back on, but on the circumstance, Rocky and CeCe are fired from Shake It Up Chicago. Later, everyone is kicked out of the suite and has to find their way back home. Later, Rocky answers CeCe's phone when Shelly calls, finding that CeCe has been taking advantage of her and they end their friendship. Meanwhile, Tinka is being deported back to the old country after hitting a security guard accidentally, but Rocky and CeCe convince the security guards to send Gunther and Tinka back to the US together. Afterwards, the app that the Watanabe grandchildren uploaded contained a virus that could go global and stop all computers, but Henry, who did not upload the app, attempts to fix it, but can't get past the firewall. They infiltrate Watanabe Global and hack the mainframe, but gets caught by Mr. Watanabe, and Andy gets damaged in the ventilation shaft. In the ending, Rocky and CeCe tries to get Mr. Watanabe to give them everything back and in the end, they perform 'Made in Japan'. At the very end, the ending credits come on with Deuce talking through the tablet, realizing that everyone left.\n\n''Guest stars'': [[Keone Young]] as Mr. Watanabe, [[R.

The Pacific Crest Trail skirts the densely forested lower west side of the peak.\n\nThe Sawtooth Berry Fields is located north of Sawtooth Mountain, around Surprise Lakes and the Sawtooth Trailhead for the Pacific Crest Trail.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cascade Volcanoes]]\n* [[List of volcanoes in the United States of America]]\n* [[Indian Heaven Wilderness]]\n* [[Indian Heaven]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20101109152420/http://www.fs.fed.us/gpnf/recreation/wilderness/wilderness-indian-heaven.shtml Gifford Pinchot National Forest - Indian Heaven Wilderness]\n* [http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Volcanoes/Washington/IndianHeaven/description_indian_heaven.html USGS - Indian Heaven Volcanic Field]\n* [http://www.summitpost.org/sawtooth-mountain/154653 SummitPost: Sawtooth Mountain]\n*[http://www.fs.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsinternet/!ut/p/c5/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3gDfxMDT8MwRydLA1cj72BTJw8jAwgAykeaxcN4jhYG_h4eYX5hPgYweSJ0G-AAjoR0h4Nci992sAm4zffzyM9N1S_IDY0wyDJRBABZRw4s/dl3/d3/L2dJQSEvUUt3QS9ZQnZ3LzZfME80MEkxVkFCOTBFMktTNURLMjAwMDAwMDA!/?ss=110603&navtype=BROWSEBYSUBJECT&navid=110000000000000&pnavid=null&position=BROWSEBYSUBJECT&recid=79410&groupid=107413&ttype=generalinfo&pname=Overview/Background Indian Heaven Wilderness Overview/Background]\n* [http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_MEDIA/stelprdb5160883.pdf Printable Indian Heaven Wilderness Trail Vicinity Map (PDF 85 K, Adobe Acrobat)]\n\n[[Category:Cascade Range]]\n[[Category:Shield volcanoes of the United States]]\n[[Category:Subduction volcanoes]]\n[[Category:Cascade Volcanoes]]\n[[Category:Volcanoes of Skamania County, Washington]]\n[[Category:Volcanoes of Washington (state)]]\n[[Category:Polygenetic volcanoes]]\n[[Category:Pleistocene volcanoes]]\n[[Category:Gifford Pinchot National Forest]]\n[[Category:Cinder cones of the United States]]\n", "name_user": "Writhing", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sawtooth_Mountain"}

He was the son of Wentworth Smyth, a Jacobite who had fought in the risings of [[Jacobite rising of 1715|1715]] and [[Jacobite rising of 1745|1745]] and was killed in the Highlands at some time after the birth of his son. According to Stuart\u2019s later account, in 1744 his father was sixty-six and married Maria Julia Dalziel, a girl of fifteen, who died three years later. He reported that his mother was a grand-daughter of [[James Crofts (British Army officer)|General James Crofts]], a natural son of the [[James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth|Duke of Monmouth]], and that his father was Monmouth\u2019s natural son by Lady Henrietta Maria Wentworth, a daughter of [[Thomas Wentworth, 5th Baron Wentworth]], and grand-daughter of [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Cleveland]]. Henrietta Maria had died in 1686, not long after Monmouth's execution, and her son Wentworth was adopted by a Colonel Smyth, an [[aide-de-camp]] of Monmouth, becoming his heir.<ref name=dnb>[[Edward Irving Carlyle]], \u201cStuart, John Ferdinand Smyth\u201d, in ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]] 1885-1900'', Vol. 55</ref>\n\nJohn Ferdinand Smyth studied medicine at the  University of Edinburgh.

The [[American Revolutionary War|War of Independence]] broke out, and on 15 October 1775, as a loyalist to the Crown, Smyth quitted Virginia and joined the [[British Army]].

Impoverished, he took a job as a barrack-master and wrote his book ''A Tour in the United States of America'', which was published by [[George Robinson (1737\u20131801)|George Robinson]] in 1786.

London.JPG|thumb|Stained glass in Guildhall, London, showing Henry fitz Ailwin]]\n\n==Origins==\nOf English rather than [[Normans|Norman]] descent, fitz Ailwin's family had been active in the commercial and civic life of London for generations. His grandfather Leofstan (died about 1115) was probably the [[portreeve]] of London, who in 1108 was involved in the foundation of [[Holy Trinity Priory, Aldgate]]. The house of his father Ailwin (died 1164/5) was where the [[husting]] court of London met and his uncle Robert was an official of the weavers' [[guild]] in 1130.<ref name = Keene/>\n\n==Career==\nLittle is known of his business interests, which probably centred on making, finishing, and selling cloth. In politics, he was an [[alderman]] by 1168 and became one of the most influential men in the city.<ref name = Keene/> Under King [[Richard I of England|Richard I]] and his brother King [[John, King of England|John]], the royal need to raise finance from London businessmen resulted in the grant of greater autonomy to the city, which previously had been governed by a [[portreeve]], an officer of the crown.<ref>Charles Knight, ''The Popular History of England'' (1856) Bradbury and Evans</ref> Instead, the office of mayor emerged, with fitz Ailwin first named as such in 1194. \n\nIn 1193 he was one of the those entrusted with the money collected for the King's ransom and in 1208 negotiated for the use of ground outside the walls as a city burial ground.<ref name = Keene/> After the [[Early_fires_of_London#The_Great_Fire_of_1212|great fire of 1212]], he and other city officials issued a code governing new building that expressly emphasised fire prevention and safety.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=35968 | title=London Nuisance, 1301-1431: A Calendar| location=London | publisher= London Record Society | year= 1973 | accessdate= 2018-05-11}}</ref> FitzAilwin promulgated the law known as the [[Assize of Building]] forms the basis of the modern law of trespass.

H.T.Riley, ''Munimenta Gildhallae Londoniensis'', i, (1859), pp.319-32</ref> Since the devastating fire of Stephen's reign had gutted all London, FitzAilwin was decided that some efforts should be made to bring in Regulations to build houses in stone.  The [[Assize of Nuisance]] was described by Bracton in his Notes as being applicable to property freeholders, so the damage had to be seen to be believed.<ref>Bracton, ''De legibus et consuetudinibus Angliae'', ed.

He contributed to the foundation of [[St. Mary Spital|St Mary Spital]] and at [[Watton-at-Stone]] was remembered as the founder of a chapel.  He died on 19 September 1212 and was buried in Holy Trinity Priory, where his tomb could still be seen in the sixteenth century. There was also a memorial to him in the church of [[St Mary Bothaw]].<ref name = Keene/>\n\n==Landholdings==\nIn 1165 he and his brother Alan inherited their father's lands, probably those at Watton-at-Stone in [[Hertfordshire]],\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://watton-pc.org.uk/history/ | title=History of Watton-atte-Stone| accessdate=2018-05-11 }}</ref> which became his country home. He also had properties at [[Edmonton, London|Edmonton]] in [[Middlesex]], in [[Surrey]], and beside the [[Thames]] in [[Kent]]. In London, his business headquarters were on what was then called Candlewick Street, now [[Cannon Street]], and he also owned many premises in the eastern half of the city.<ref name = Keene/>\n\n==Family==\nHis widow was named Margaret and was probably the mother of his four sons: Peter, Alan, Thomas and Richard. Peter, the eldest, married Isabel, daughter of Bartholomew de Chesney, of [[Addington, Surrey]], and died in 1211 before his father.

Between the years 1521-1522 the town suffered different epidemics (cholera, measles, smallpox, and plague). As a result, the native inhabitants abandoned the area. After this event, the new Nochixtl\u00e1n was founded in 1527 by Francisco Orozco, who was assissted by fifty Mixtecs who survived these diseases. All of them were intellectuals, who also did commerce activity. For this reason the town became known as \"the traders' town\". There is a myth that in 997 [[Quetzalc\u00f3atl]], arrived to the municipality. He was a Mixtec God who disseminates the culture, science and art in this region. In 1997 was the 1,000 anniversary of this event. That is why people expect something to happen. On the same year (1997) Mexico achieved 75 years of public education. Its promoter was Nochixtl\u00e1n Abraham's son.  Nochixtl\u00e1n Abraham Castellanos Coronado, who was a professor, writer, and philosopher, helped to develop the cultural values of this culture.<ref name=\"encmuc\"/>\n\n==Economic Activity==\nAsunci\u00f3n Nochixtl\u00e1n has two principal economic sectors - Agriculture forms part of one of these sectors. With the corn, bean and wheat harvest, agriculture is practiced at a family level. The other principal sector is ranching. Asunci\u00f3n Nochixtl\u00e1n is a municipality that forms part of the bovine ranching production. In terms of commerce, Asunci\u00f3n Nochixtl\u00e1n trades crafts. It also has grocery stores, drugstores, furniture stores and hardware stores. The facilities that Asunci\u00f3n Nochixtl\u00e1n offers are: hotel service, guest house and motels. According to [[INEGI]] in 2000, the active economic population of this municipality is 5,037 persons, but only 5,022 have a job. Of these people, the primary sector (agriculture, ranching, fishing and hunting) has 27%. The secondary sector forms part with a 25% and the third sector (commerce, tourism and services) is leading the economic activity with 48% of the active population.<ref name=\"encmuc\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[2016 conflict in Nochixtl\u00e1n]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Nochixtl\u00e1n District, Oaxaca}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Asuncion Nochixtlan}}\n[[Category:Municipalities of Oaxaca]]\n[[Category:Populated places in Oaxaca]]\n[[Category:909 establishments]]\n[[Category:10th-century establishments in North America]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox settlement\n<!--See the Table at Infobox Settlement for all fields and descriptions of usage-->\n<!-- Basic info  ---------------->\n|name          =  Asunci\u00f3n Nochixtl\u00e1n\n|settlement_type        =[[Municipalities of Mexico|Municipality]] and town\n|other_name             =\n|native_name            =  <!-- for cities whose native name is not in English -->\n|nickname               = \n|motto                  =\n<!-- images and maps  ----------->\n|image_skyline          =\n|imagesize              =\n|image_caption          =\n|image_flag             = \n|flag_size              =\n|image_seal             = \n|seal_size              =\n|image_shield           =Escudo asuncion nochixtlan.gif\n|shield_size            =\n|image_blank_emblem     =\n|blank_emblem_type      =\n|blank_emblem_size      =\n|image_map              =\n|mapsize                = \n|map_caption            = Location of the municipality in Oaxaca\n|pushpin_map            = Mexico<!-- the name of a location map as per http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Location_map -->\n|pushpin_label_position =above\n|pushpin_mapsize        =\n|pushpin_map_caption    =Location in Mexico\n<!-- Location ------------------>\n|subdivision_type       = Country\n|subdivision_name       = {{flag|Mexico}}\n|subdivision_type1      = [[Administrative divisions of Mexico|State]]\n|subdivision_name1      = [[Oaxaca]]\n|subdivision_type2      = \n|subdivision_name2      =\n<!-- Politics ----------------->\n|government_footnotes   =\n|government_type        =\n|leader_title           =\n|leader_name            =\n|established_title      = <!-- Settled -->\n|established_date       = \n<!-- Area    --------------------->\n|area_magnitude         = \n|unit_pref                = \n|area_footnotes           =\n|area_total_km2           =820.35\n<!-- ALL fields dealing with a measurements are subject to automatic unit conversion-->\n|area_land_km2            = <!--See table @ Template:Infobox Settlement for details on automatic unit conversion-->\n|area_water_km2           =\n|area_total_sq_mi         =\n|area_land_sq_mi          =\n|area_water_sq_mi         =\n|area_water_percent       =\n|area_urban_km2           =\n|area_urban_sq_mi         =\n|area_metro_km2           =\n|area_metro_sq_mi         =\n|area_blank1_title        =\n|area_blank1_km2          =\n|area_blank1_sq_mi        =\n<!-- Population   ----------------------->\n|population_as_of               =2005\n|population_footnotes           =\n|population_note                =\n|population_total               =14676\n|population_density_km2         =\n|population_density_sq_mi       =\n|population_metro               =\n|population_density_metro_km2   =\n|population_density_metro_sq_mi =\n|population_urban               =\n|population_density_urban_km2   =\n|population_density_urban_sq_mi =\n<!-- General information  --------------->\n|timezone               = [[North American Central Time Zone|Central Standard Time]]\n|utc_offset             = -6 \n|timezone_DST           = [[North American Central Time Zone|Central Daylight Time]]\n|utc_offset_DST         = -5\n|coordinates            = {{coord|17|27|N|97|13|W|region:MX|display=inline,title}}\n|elevation_footnotes    =  <!--for references: use  tags-->\n|elevation_m            = \n|elevation_ft           =\n<!-- Area/postal codes & others -------->\n|postal_code_type       =  <!-- enter ZIP code, Postcode, Post code, Postal code... -->\n|postal_code            =\n|area_code              =\n|blank_name             =\n|blank_info             =\n|blank1_name            =\n|blank1_info            =\n|website                = \n|footnotes              =\n}}\n\n''' Asunci\u00f3n Nochixtl\u00e1n ''' is a town and [[Municipalities of Mexico State|municipality]] in [[Oaxaca]] in south-western [[Mexico]].

Between the years 1521-1522 the town suffered different epidemics (cholera, measles, smallpox, and plague). As a result, the native inhabitants abandoned the area. After this event, the new Nochixtl\u00e1n was founded in 1527 by Francisco Orozco, who was assissted by fifty Mixtecs who survived these diseases. All of them were intellectuals, who also did commerce activity.<ref></ref> For this reason the town became known as \"the traders' town\". There is a myth that in 997 [[Quetzalc\u00f3atl]], arrived to the municipality. He was a Mixtec God who disseminates the culture, science and art in this region. In 1997 was the 1,000 anniversary of this event. That is why people expect something to happen. On the same year (1997) Mexico achieved 75 years of public education. Its promoter was Nochixtl\u00e1n Abraham's son.  Nochixtl\u00e1n Abraham Castellanos Coronado, who was a professor, writer, and philosopher, helped to develop the cultural values of this culture.<ref name=\"encmuc\"/>\n\n==Economic Activity==\nAsunci\u00f3n Nochixtl\u00e1n has two principal economic sectors - Agriculture forms part of one of these sectors. With the corn, bean and wheat harvest, agriculture is practiced at a family level. The other principal sector is ranching. Asunci\u00f3n Nochixtl\u00e1n is a municipality that forms part of the bovine ranching production. In terms of commerce, Asunci\u00f3n Nochixtl\u00e1n trades crafts. It also has grocery stores, drugstores, furniture stores and hardware stores. The facilities that Asunci\u00f3n Nochixtl\u00e1n offers are: hotel service, guest house and motels. According to [[INEGI]] in 2000, the active economic population of this municipality is 5,037 persons, but only 5,022 have a job. Of these people, the primary sector (agriculture, ranching, fishing and hunting) has 27%. The secondary sector forms part with a 25% and the third sector (commerce, tourism and services) is leading the economic activity with 48% of the active population.<ref name=\"encmuc\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[2016 conflict in Nochixtl\u00e1n]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Nochixtl\u00e1n District, Oaxaca}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Asuncion Nochixtlan}}\n[[Category:Municipalities of Oaxaca]]\n[[Category:Populated places in Oaxaca]]\n[[Category:909 establishments]]\n[[Category:10th-century establishments in North America]]\n", "name_user": "Mikeyjbax", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asunci%C3%B3n_Nochixtl%C3%A1n"}
