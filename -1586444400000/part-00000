The house is revealed to be the home of real monsters in the likes of [[Universal monsters]] and are set to eat the kids. However, in the midst of a chase, the kids accidentally bump a [[pipe organ]], releasing a [[Ghost|phasm]] named Flabber (Billy Forester). He proves to be friendly, and in return for releasing him, offers to grant them one wish. They wish to become their comic book heroes, the Big Bad Beetleborgs. However, this also brings the Beetleborgs' sworn enemies to life: the Magnavores, led by the evil Vexor, who would summon monsters from the comic books to battle the Beetleborgs. Roland's mom and dad run the comic book shop along with his grandmother Nano. \n\nIn a 6-parter, Vexor created his own Beetleborg, Shadowborg, which was a match for the Beetleborgs and briefly took their powers. They had to call a temporary Beetleborg (White Blaster Beetleborg) Josh Baldwin (Warren Berkow), and after Shadowborg was destroyed, Josh lost his powers. The Beetleborgs would meet the Beetleborgs comic creator, Art Fortunes, during this six-part story in order for him to create the White Blaster Beetleborg and the Mega Blue Beetleborg.\n\nIn the penultimate episode of the first season, the Magnavores steal a picture of a new villain named Nukus from Art Fortunes' office. They bring him to life to enlist his help in destroying the Beetleborgs. Nukus assists them by planning devastating attacks on the city and creating Borgslayer, a hybrid of all the Magnavore monsters. Unbeknownst to the Magnavores, Nukus was actually plotting to get rid of them. Nukus tells Van and Trip (who were fleeing Charterville during Borgslayer's attack to their father's country estate) how to defeat Borgslayer, and orders them to take the information to the Beetleborgs. They succeed in destroying Borgslayer, causing the Magnavores to be swept back into the comics. The Big Bad Beetleborgs are here for good!\n\n===Season 2===\nAt the start of Season 2, Nukus has challenged the Beetleborgs. Despite Art's warning that Nukus is too powerful, they face him anyway. Nukus quickly wipes them out, destroying their Beetleborgs armor, weapons, and powers in one fell swoop.\n\nThese events lead directly into the second season ''Beetleborgs Metallix''. Nukus discovers that his creator is actually Art's incarcerated brother Les Fortunes. Nukus busts Les out of prison and uses some of Les' drawings to summon his own group of villains called the Crustaceans. Les now serves Nukus by creating new monsters for him to use. In response to the rise of the Crustaceans, Art creates new powers, armor, vehicles, and weapons, which Flabber then brings to life again for the kids, who rechristen themselves as Beetleborgs Metallix, hence the title. \n\nThe battle between the Beetleborgs and the Crustaceans would later escalate after the Fortunes brothers unburied a time capsule containing the Lost Comic; a story both brothers worked on when they were children. Said story featured the Astral Sword that could summon and control the all-mighty Roboborg, if one manages to gather the eight Astral Coins. Nukus summons his own evil team of Borgs from the Lost Comic called the Mantrons, while the Beetleborgs are reinforced by the Astral Borgs. After a many battles, the Beetleborgs finally get their hands on the Astral Sword and all eight coins, using it to summon Roboborg, who, soonafter, demonstrates his powers by sending the Mantrons back to the Lost Comic.\n\nTo fight Roboborg, the Crustaceans eventually created their own giant robot named Boron, while Nukus and Vilor gain upgraded Mega forms. As a response to Nukus' and Vilor's new Mega forms, the Beetleborgs were given an upgrade by Roboborg who fused their Metallix powers with their original powers creating the Mega Spectra Beetleborgs. Vilor's \"mega\" form did not last long and he quietly returned to his original look without explanation. However, Mega Nukus retained his upgraded look.\n\nThe series concluded with the Beetleborgs gaining the enemy Boron as an ally, stripping Nukus of his greatest weapon during the fight against Repgillian. Les Fortunes makes the decision to return willingly to Charterville Prison, disabling Nukus' ability to create new monsters out of illustrations. With no known way of returning the Crustaceans to the comic world, the Beetleborgs were left with an unresolved final battle with what was left of their foes.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Beetleborgs===\n* '''Andrew \"Drew\" McCormick''' (portrayed by Wesley Barker) \u2013 The Blue Stinger Beetleborg, and later the Chromium Gold Beetleborg in the second season, is the leader of the Beetleborgs. He was granted the ability of [[Psychokinesis|telekinesis]] by Flabber, which he activated by pointing at an object and nodding his head. Drew received an upgrade, Mega Blue Beetleborg, after he used the energy axis that powered Shadowborg on his original armor. After Roboborg arrived, Drew received a new upgrade, Mega Spectra Chromium Gold Beetleborg, after Nukus and Vilor went Mega themselves. His armor was modeled after a [[Japanese rhinoceros beetle]].\n* '''Roland Williams''' (portrayed by Herbie Baez) \u2013 The Green Hunter Beetleborg, and later the Titanium Silver Beetleborg in the second season, his family owns a local [[comic book]] shop named Zoom Comics, where he, Jo, and Drew usually hang out. He was granted the ability of [[speed|super speed]] by Flabber, which he activated by snapping his fingers. After Roboborg arrived, Roland received an upgrade, Mega Spectra Titanium Silver Beetleborg, after Nukus and Vilor went Mega themselves. His armor was modeled after a [[stag beetle]].\n* '''Josephine \"Jo\" McCormick''' (portrayed by Shannon Chandler in episodes 1\u201339, Brittany Konarzewski in 39\u201388) \u2013 The Red Striker Beetleborg, and later the Platinum Purple Beetleborg in the second season, Drew's little sister, she was granted the ability of [[superhuman strength|super strength]] by Flabber, which she activated by cracking her knuckles. After Roboborg arrived, Jo received an upgrade, Mega Spectra Platinum Purple Beetleborg, after Nukus and Vilor went Mega themselves. Her Red Striker armor was modeled after a female Japanese rhinoceros beetle, and her Platinum Purple armor after a [[Coccinellidae|ladybug]]. Jo is often shown wearing a baseball cap backwards. A unique casting change occurred and instead of an official departure removing the character Jo from the cast, when Shannon Chandler left the series, her character remained. Halfway through Season 1, Wolfgang (while playing with a magic book) accidentally cast a spell that caused Jo to change in appearance. Brittany Konarzewski took over Chandler's role in the guise of actually being the original Jo with a new look and voice. To counteract this, Flabber used his magic to make her look and sound the way she always had, but it didn't work on anyone who actually watched the spell being cast. So the viewers, Flabber, Drew, Roland, and Jo herself could still see Jo in her new appearance, but the Hilhurst monsters as well as their family and friends saw her as she looked before. According to Flabber, the spell would eventually wear off (this didn't happen during the series).\n* '''Josh Baldwin''' (portrayed by Warren Berkow) \u2013 The White Blaster Beetleborg, granted the ability of [[invisibility]] by Flabber, which he activated by dusting his hands. He was on the team for a very short period of time. The White Blaster Beetleborg was created after Shadowborg, an evil clone of the Beetleborgs, stole their powers. He succeeded in getting their powers back. However, it was soon discovered that the White Blaster and Shadowborg were linked in a fashion of [[yin and yang]] (mainly because the White Blaster powers were created solely to battle Shadowborg), meaning if one was destroyed, the other would lose his power forever (it could be assumed that it didn't really bother him, seeing as he felt he couldn't handle a superhero life). Josh and Drew were rivals to fall for Heather. Josh accompanied the Beetleborgs in the final battle against Shadowborg, where he transformed for the final time. Shadowborg was defeated by Drew (in his Mega Blue Beetleborg form) and due to the link, Josh lost his powers at which point Josh returned to a normal life. Josh has suggested to Art Fortunes that he should include the White Blaster Beetleborg in his later comics alongside the Mega Blue Beetleborg form. Although he said that if the others ever needed him again, he'd be there (but this was the last we saw of him). It was slightly hinted that Jo had a crush on him. His armour was modeled after a [[Hercules beetle]].\n\n===Hillhurst Inhabitants===\nAn old mansion outside of Charterville had fallen into disrepair since the passing of Old Man Hillhurst and became home to some rather goofy monsters. With the exception of Flabber, all the monsters attempt to eat any humans who trespass in their home. As a running gag, they never learn their lesson about trying to go after the Beetleborgs who always manage to outwit or clobber them. Wolfgang and Little Ghoul later move in throughout the series.\n\n* '''Flabber''' (portrayed by Billy Forester) \u2013 As described above, Flabber is a [[Ghost|phantasm]] (phasm) who was trapped inside a [[pipe organ]], and was freed by the kids. Out of gratitude he granted their wish to become their comic book heroes, the Big Bad Beetleborgs. This event also unintentionally released the Magnavores. Flabber was released by playing 3 notes on the organ. (He later revealed that playing those same 3 notes, then playing them in reverse would re-entrap him inside the organ). He acts as an advisor and best friend, and offers needed magic to the kids when fighting the Magnavores, and later the Crustaceans, though his magic does not always work the way he may hope for it to work. He is the head of the Hillhurst Mansion and is usually the one to keep the house monsters in check. The producers of the show said that he was based on [[Elvis Presley]].\n* '''Mums''' (voiced by [[Michael Sorich]] in the pilot episode, performed by Blake Torney in later episodes) \u2013 Mums is a 5,000-year-old Egyptian [[Mummy (undead)|mummy]] that used to be a prince, but he can unwrap his bandages to reveal a \"[[Death (personification)|Grim Reaper]]\"-like form under his bandages (which only occurred once) and is considered more scary.{{efn|Mums' brief Reaper form is a recycled version of Shinigamian from ''Juukou B-Fighter''.}} He has 703 brothers and sisters. In \"Curse of the Mums' Tomb,\" two archaeologists came to return Mums to the crypt in which they found him in order to get rid of a curse placed on them upon waking him. He would need a \"magical beetle\", but using a Beetleborg would cause loss of their powers. In the same episode, Mums mentions that he was mummified alive after he was caught kissing [[Cleopatra]] in public. His mother also has a family heirloom that can turn others (such as Fangula) into monsters by shouting \"[[Eureka (word)|Eureka]]!\"\n* '''Frankenbeans''' (performed by David Fletcher) \u2013 Frankenbeans (called \"Frankie\" for short) is a strange, lumbering [[Frankenstein's monster]]-type monster. He was once kidnapped by the Magnavores on Halloween, and held for ransom in exchange for the Beetleborgs' Beetle Bonders. He allows Wolfie to stay in a dog house kept in his room. He has little ability to speak, often roaring or saying toddler-like sentences; in short, he's the more stupid of the monsters. He actually has no brain (literally), something that often causes a lot of jokes involving him (but a benefit in one episode, as it made him immune to the attack of the \"Brain-Sucker\" monster created by Nukus). His creator Dr. Baron von Frankenbeans showed up in a few episodes.\n* '''Count Fangula''' (portrayed by Joe Hackett) \u2013 Loosely modeled after [[Count Dracula]], Count Fangula is a [[vampire]] (albeit one of questionable aptitude in the [[Black magic|Dark Arts]]). He seems to be the only one to understand what Wolfie may be saying. He mentioned in Wolfie's introductory episode that they were roommates \"in the old country.\" He once succeeded into getting two victims in Van and Trip, temporarily turning them into vampires that were turned back to normal by kisses from Jo. If his victims quota is too low, a high ranking vampire will come to evaluate him like his boss Vlad did in \"Fangula's Last Bite.\" He's also known to have an ex-wife who he's very afraid of.\n* '''The Pipettes''' (portrayed by Traci Bellusci) \u2013 A multicolor spirit-like trio of ladies who live in the pipe organ. They look identical except for the colors. The Pipettes act as Flabber's back-up singers. They were dropped halfway through the first series.\n* '''Ghoulum''' (performed by Dan Letlow) \u2013 A living stone [[statue]] monster that resides in Hillhurst Mansion who often had little to say or do other than what statues do best, stand in place. While not the most active monster of Hillhurst Mansion on rare occasions, he would join in on the other monsters' mischief. In one episode, he was accidentally exposed to a \"Bad Potion\" turning him evil and causing him to grow to giant-size and fall under Noxic's control.\n* '''Wolfgang \"Wolfie\" Smith''' (performed by Frank Tahoe, voiced by [[Michael Sorich]] in the first appearance, [[Scott Page-Pagter]] in later appearances) \u2013 Wolfie is a [[werewolf]] and is treated more like a family dog than a monster at Hillhurst. His voice sounds similar to [[Scooby-Doo (character)|Scooby-Doo]]. Only Fangula can translate what Wolfie is saying most of the time since Fangula was once Wolfie's roommate. Probably the bravest and most cunning of the Hillhurst Monsters because he's the only one of the group who tangled with the bad guys at least once. Wolfie was once responsible for using a spellbook to accidentally change Jo's appearance which got him in trouble with Flabber. He bargained with the Beetleborgs to be let on a mission with them in exchange for the final Astralborg coin he was ransoming.\n* '''Little Ghoul''' (portrayed by Lina Godouse) \u2013 A [[Jawa (Star Wars)|Jawa]]-like [[ghoul]] who was the latest addition to the Hillhurst group in season two. She lives in the basement and rarely comes out. As the niece of the [[Death (personification)|Grim Reaper]], Little Ghoul is a grim reaper-in-training who loves collecting. She also has a short temper, which scares the other monsters even more than her true appearance under her hood. She has little to no respect for anyone. She does however have a great deal of respect for the Astralborgs. In one episode, she possessed a head that originally belonged to the [[Headless Horseman (Legend of Sleepy Hollow)|Headless Horseman]]. In another episode, Little Ghoul became attached to a monster she named Emily after it bloomed from the Seed of Evil which Horribelle had given her during her brief obsession with gardening.\n\n===Allies===\n* '''\"Nano\" Williams''' (portrayed by Vivian Smallwood) \u2013 Roland's grandmother, Aaron's mother, and Abbie's mother-in-law. Nano is one hip granny and a trained [[martial artist]]. When she's not running Zoom Comics or practicing her moves, she's often seen riding her motorcycle. Nano often helps out the kids when they're in a jam. If nothing else, she enjoys teasing her son Aaron.\n* '''Aaron Williams''' (portrayed by Kim Delgado) \u2013 Roland's father, Abbie's husband and Nano's son. He ran Zoom Comics full-time and is often embarrassed by his mother's antics. Aaron was soon called away on business halfway through Season One, leaving the shop in the hands of his wife Abbie.\n* '''Abbie Williams''' (portrayed by Channe Nolen) \u2013 Roland's mother and Nano's daughter-in-law. She primarily works as a [[real estate]] agent. When her husband, Aaron, gone on business, she assumed running Zoom Comics. She and her mother in-law don't see eye to eye but she didn't really know how to run a comic book shop. With a little help from Flabber's magic, Abbie's heart opened up and rekindled fond childhood memories of a comic she once loved reading. She ran the shop for the remainder of the series.\n* '''Heather''' (portrayed by Elizabeth Z. Lund) \u2013 Drew's crush. No matter what, Drew could never tell Heather what he really felt. She would sometimes help out at the comic shop, and she also enjoyed reading them. During the Shadowborg saga, she developed a crush on Josh.\n* '''Trip and Van''' (portrayed by Todd Hurst and Patrick Seaborn) \u2013 These brothers constantly pestered the kids daily lives by flaunting their wealth and self-acclaimed superiority. Trip was the smarter of the two whereas Van was a bit slow. They often came up with get-rich-quick schemes, ways to humiliate the kids, or simply to cause trouble where they would often dragging Dudley into their schemes. They were the one's who dared Jo, Roland, and Drew to enter Hillhurst, which led to them becoming Beetleborgs. During the Borgslayer fiascom they left town to go live at their father's country estate. Before they left town, Nukus forced them to return to town to tell the Beetleborgs how to defeat Borgslayer in order to get rid of the Magnavores. The two of them were dropped after Season One and are only mentioned once in Season Two.\n** '''Dudley''' (portrayed by Dudley Davis) \u2013 Dudley is the [[chauffeur]] who works for Trip and Van's parents. He would be unwittingly dragged into Trip and Van's schemes. Like Trip and Van, Dudley isn't seen again after Season One.\n* '''Dr. Baron von Frankenbeans''' (portrayed by Don Altman) \u2013 A [[mad scientist]] who is based on [[Victor Frankenstein]] and is the creator of Frankenbeans. He treated the monsters like servants. Whenever he announced his full name, he would be spotlighted by moonlight as lightning would flash and a wolf would howl outside (even if it was daylight). He first appeared to visit his son and do medical treatment on the monsters. Dr. Frankenbeans even helped the Beetleborgs by giving them a suggestion on how to defeat Cyber-Serpent by opening fire on him while he's standing over his comic. In \"Operation Frankenbeans,\" Dr. Frankenbeans returned where he implanted a new brain into Frankenbeans. While it made Frankenbeans smart, it also made him not see Dr. Frankenbeans as his father. This lasted until Frankenbeans fell down the stairs, hit his head, and go back to his original intellect. In \"Bride of Frankenbeans,\" Dr. Frankenbeans returned where he had assembled a mate for Frankenbeans (who was based off the [[Bride of Frankenstein (character)|Bride of Frankenstein]]). Even though the Beetleborgs stopped Crimson Creep from crashing the wedding, Frankenbeans' relationship with the \"bride\" was short and she was deactivated and dismantled. In \"Son of Frankenbeans,\" Dr. Frankenbeans returned where he had created a \"son\" for Frankenbeans. In \"Experiment of Evil,\" Dr. Frankenbeans created the \"Monster Mother: Root of all Evil\" for the Hillhurst monster who wanted to end the danger posed to their home. He claims that in order to defeat evil, one must be eviler.\n* '''Arthur \"Art\" Fortunes''' (portrayed by Rigg Kennedy) \u2013 Creator of the Beetleborgs comics who shows up time and time again with new ways to help the kids. He often collaborates with Flabber's magic to bring new arsenal to the kids. Art Fortunes has a brother named Les Fortunes where they had a sibling rivalry. When they were young, Art and Les had a brief collaboration on the \"Lost Comic\" where Art created the Astralborgs and Les created the Mantrons. A running gag is that the Hillhurst monsters focus on trying to eat him instead of the kids when they're out fighting the villains.\n* '''Karato''' (voiced by [[Richard Epcar]]) and '''Silver Ray''' \u2013 Two other comic book superheroes that the kids are fans of. When the Magnavores released an army of monsters while trying to kidnap Art Fortunes from a comic book convention, the Beetleborgs were afraid of being unable to beat them all by themselves. Flabber agreed to use his magic on just that one occasion to summon other superheroes from the comics to help. In B-Fighter, Karato was one of the other Metal Hero protagonists [[Tokusou Robo Janperson|Janperson]] while Silver Ray was his rival-turned ally Gun Gibson, and Goldex was the main villain Bill Goldy (used by the villains as a pawn after being revived), but was absorbed into Borgslayer. The B-Fighters also teamed up with the [[Blue SWAT]] team, but they weren't adapted into Beetleborgs.\n* '''Astralborgs''' \u2013 Four heroes of the Lost Comic that were created by Art Fortunes and Les Fortunes. When the Beetleborgs acquired their coins, they are able to summon the Astralborgs to help them fight Nukus' forces.\n** '''Dragonborg''' (voiced by [[Doug Stone (voice actor)|Doug Stone]] impersonating [[Sean Connery]]) \u2013 Modeled after a [[dragonfly]], Dragonborg is the leader of the Astralborgs. His astral laser comes with a powerful sting.\n** '''Fireborg''' (voiced by Gene Holliday) \u2013 An Astralborg that is modeled after a [[firefly]]. He can shoot balls of fire from his fingertips.\n** '''Lightingborg''' (voiced by [[Richard Epcar]]) \u2013 An Astralborg who is modeled after a [[cicada]]. He can shoot electrical currents from the blades of his two swords or the antennae on his helmet.\n** '''Ladyborg''' (voiced by [[Barbara Goodson]]) \u2013 An Astralborg who is modeled after a [[butterfly]]. Her large cannon opens up like a flower to fire a powerful beam.\n\n===Villains===\n* '''Magnavores''' (2\u201353) \u2013 The first set of villains the Beetleborgs faced, who originated from the Beetleborgs comic series. They were released due to Flabber granting the kids' wish which unintentionally released them. While in Charterville, the Magnavores use the old Charterville cemetery as their lair. By the end of Season One, the Magnavores were sent back into the comics as a side effect of Borgslayer's destruction.\n** '''Vexor''' (first performed by Rick Tane and later by Kisu, voiced by Joey Pal) \u2013 The leader of the Magnavores. He loses patience with his Magnavores' incompetence and does not appear in every episode. He appeared to have been destroyed by the combined efforts of all three Beetleborgs stabbing their Beetle Battlers into his body and pulling him to the ground, after Drew battled with and destroyed Shadowborg, but quickly revived himself, sprouting a new body and face and even managed to grow giant. In his following appearance, he somehow switched back to his old self/appearance.\n** '''Typhus''' (performed by Kyle Jordan, voiced by Dave \"Foots\" Footman) \u2013 A [[Chimera (mythology)|Chimera]]/composite-like humanoid monster, prefers brawn over brain and his [[whale]]-like flattop is an extra mouth with which he eats food or other objects. In battle, he sometimes wields a sword-like weapon that latches to his arm or his mouth. This weapon can also blast lasers when latched to his extra mouth. On one occasion, he emitted bees from his extra mouth. He was temporarily turned into Mega Typhus.\n** '''Noxic''' (performed by Lee Whey, voiced by [[Derek Stephen Prince|David Umansky]]) \u2013 An [[Android (robot)|android]] with coils for hair who wears a white labcoat-like jacket. He can control machinery and other objects by removing his head and attaching it to them. In a dream of his, Noxic took control of a bulldozer with his head and tried to destroy the Beetleborgs. He later used this same technique to take control of Ghoulum, when he went bad from the \"Bad Potion.\" He has an unseen wicked friend from the comic books as well named Dr. Cackle who created the Bad Potion. Noxic prefers to eat donuts all day long instead of doing Vexor's bidding. He has an older brother named Super Noxic though technically Noxic was created first. In battle, he sometimes wields an umbrella-like weapon.\n** '''Jara''' (performed by Balinda English in U.S. Footage, voiced by Rajia Baroudi) - A female humanoid clad in red attire and a white mask. She speaks with a Russian accent. Despite her face being remade 3-dimensional, she cannot consume food or smile in the real world because the mouth on her mask could never open (she emphasizes this by saying that she has no mouth). She was bitten by Wolfgang in one episode and became a werewolf and enamored with Wolfgang. By the end of the episode, Jara was returned to her normal form by a rubber arrow shot by Flabber which contained antidote and retained none of her affection for Wolfgang. In battle, she sometimes wields a whip that when cracked releases destructive energy.\n** '''Shadowborg''' (voiced by [[Bob Papenbrook]]) (26\u201331) \u2013 A black evil Beetleborg created by Vexor from ionic DNA and insectite material stolen from the Blue Stinger Beetleborg. Not only is Shadowborg created from the basic materials as Blue Stinger, but he is enhanced with some of the powers of the other Beetleborgs. Shadowborg can run faster than the Green Hunter, jump higher than Red Striker, and remain underwater for 51 minutes. Shadowborg's architectural armor is modeled after a [[Longhorn beetle|longicorn beetle]]. With his Shadow Claw, Shadowborg can cut through any substance known to the planet. He was finally destroyed by the Blue Stinger Beetleborg in his Mega Blue Form.\n** '''Scabs''' (3\u201353) \u2013 Yellow-black creatures who are the [[Infantry|foot soldiers]] of the Magnavores. Unlike in most Saban adaptations, these grunt soldiers were barely used.\n** '''Magnavore Jet Fighters''' (3\u201353)- Air-borne, wasp-resembling machine jets. Summoned to attack the Beetleborgs on several occasions.\n* '''\"Crustaceans\"''' (52\u201388) \u2013 Villains created by Les Fortunes, the second set of villains the Beetleborgs faced. After the Magnavores were defeated, the \"Crustaceans\" used the old Charterville cemetery as their lair.\n** '''Nukus''' (performed and voiced by Christopher Cho) (52\u201381) \u2013 A creation of Les Fortunes, Nukus is the [[Triceratops]]-based ''Overlord of the 2nd Dimension''. His drawing was hidden away in Art Fortune's vault until the Magnavores took the picture and Vexor brought him to life. Nukus quickly set a plan to dispose the Magnavores and take over as the new villain which involved combining the energies of the monsters he brought out into Borgslayer. When Borgslayer was destroyed, the Magnavores returned to the comics and Nukus went to confront the Beetleborgs. Nukus had an advantage over the Beetleborgs as he destroyed both the paper he came out of. Nukus also destroyed the Beetleborgs' original armor, weapons, and powers. When he raided Hillhurst, Nukus turned Flabber into ice and discovered Art Fortunes with another picture of Nukus which was actually drawn by his brother Les. With this knowledge, Nukus broke Les out of prison, brought Horribelle, Vilor, and the Dregs to life, and used Les' skills to create deadly monsters that could be brought to life with the use of his sword where he would say the name of Les' creation and quote \"Arise\" where the drawing came to life. He later gained a mega form called '''Mega Nukus''' (81\u201388) from touching Les Fortunes' transmographier device which he destroyed soon after to ensure no one else received an upgrade from it.\n** '''Horribelle''' (performed and voiced by Claudine Barros) (54\u201388) \u2013 [[Second-in-command]] of the Crustaceans, an [[insect]]-based sword-toting fighter and Nukus' right-hand woman upon being brought to life by Nukus from Les' drawing of her. Like Nukus, she can summon a face-mask in battle. She also wields two swords that resemble mantis arms. Horribelle once rebelled against the Crustaceans by having Les Fortunes create the Astral Axe, so she could control its powers out of a scorn for not receiving a mega form like the main male villains.\n** '''Vilor''' (performed by Kyle Jordan, voiced by Dave \"Foots\" Footman) (54\u201388) \u2013 Third-in-command of the Crustaceans, a [[fish]]-based and trident-toting fighter. He was created by Les in prison and brought to life by Nukus. Vilor briefly gains a second form called '''Super Vilor''' in \"Wolfie's Wild Ride\" in which while the Mantrons takeover fighting, he makes Les Fortunes a deal: a new form in exchange for a new drawing table. Vilor manages to persuade Nukus to make this upgrade happen. When defeated Super Vilor returned to where the drawing was made, he falls on Les Fortunes' new drawing table as regular Vilor. Later, Vilor got a brief mega form called '''Mega Vilor''' (81) after touching Les Fortunes' transmographier device prior to its destruction. Though he somehow reverted to his normal state.\n** '''Lester \"Les\" Fortunes''' (portrayed by Marshal Hilton) (54\u201388) \u2013 The [[black sheep]] in the Fortunes family and Art's older brother who has the same artistic talents as his brother. When they were young, Les and Art had a brief collaboration on the \"Lost Comic\" where Art created the Astralborgs and Les created the Mantrons. Les was responsible for drawing the picture of Nukus which the Magnavores brought to life. He was in prison when Nukus recruited him to his cause. Despite creating Horribelle, Vilor, the Dregs, and all the Crustacean monsters and their arsenal, Les never gets any respect or credit for it. After Repgillian's destruction, Les and Nukus decided to finally part ways after Les decided to go back to jail for some peace and quiet. He remarked that the Crustaceans were going to miss him while stating that he created them and he can erase them. As he left, Horribelle remarked she never really did like him.\n** '''Mantrons''' (75\u201382) \u2013 Evil counterparts of the Astralborgs. Created by Les Fortunes as a child to rival Art Fortunes' Astralborgs in their only collaboration the Lost Comic. They were there to aid Nukus in his plans to get Roboborg who ultimately made it to the good hands of the Beetleborgs. In \"Roboborg\" (part 8 of the Lost Comic saga), the Mantrons were finally sent back to the Lost Comic for good by the combined attacks of the Beetleborgs, Astralborgs, and Roboborg.\n*** '''Scorpix''' (voiced by [[Bob Papenbrook]]) \u2013 Modeled after a [[scorpion]], Scorpix is the leader of the Mantrons.\n*** '''Centipix''' (voiced by Lee Hondo Woodford) \u2013 A Mantron that is modeled after a [[centipede]].\n*** '''Mantix''' (voiced by [[Ezra Weisz|Ethan Murray]]) \u2013 A Mantron that is modeled after a [[mantis]].\n*** '''Hornix''' (voiced by [[Neil Kaplan|Bob Johnson]]) \u2013 A Mantron that is modeled after a [[hornet]].\n** '''Dregs''' (55\u201388) \u2013 Assorted monsters used as foot soldiers that were created by Les Fortunes when he was in jail and brought to life by Nukus. Dregs came in two groups. One group was based on land animals and wore brown slacks and black boots (consisting of the [[Pteranodon|Ptera]] Dreg, the [[Spider]] Dreg, and the [[Stegoceras|Stego]] Dreg). The other based on sea creatures and wore blue spandex pants and white boots (consisting of the [[Fish]] Dreg, [[Jellyfish]] Dreg, [[Squid]] Dreg).\n** '''Worm Tanks''' (55\u201388) \u2013 Giant worm like vehicles summoned to attack the Beetleborgs on several occasions.\n** '''Crustacean Jet Fighters''' (56\u201388) \u2013 Air-borne machines based on the design of the Worm Tank summoned to attack the Beetleborgs on several occasions.\n\n====Monsters====\n{{main|List of Beetleborgs monsters}}\n\n==Arsenal==\n\n===Big Bad Beetleborgs===\n* '''Beetle Bonders''' \u2013 The Beetleborgs' transformation devices.

One spell gives all three the power to change into somewhat larger versions of their respective insects (about the size of their fists), then revert to human. By saying \"Bug out!\", they change into bugs. To become human again, they say \"Bug back!\" The trio are able to use this ability in either human or Beetleborg form, and will never lose it. When in insect mode, their colors are the same as those on their new Metallix armor.\n* '''Data Bonders''' \u2013 The Beetleborgs' transformation devices.

Housed in the Beetle Battle Base, minus Gargantis. The Beetle Battle Base and the A.V.'s were destroyed by the Magnavore Jet Fighters' missiles at the end of the first season.\n** '''Gargantis Mega Cannon''' \u2013 Combination of the Beetleborgs A.V.'s and Gargantis. It is their most powerful weapon of all.\n*** '''Blue Stinger A.V.''' \u2013 Blue Stinger Beetleborg's A.V.\n*** '''Green Hunter A.V.''' \u2013 Green Hunter Beetleborg's A.V.\n*** '''Red Striker A.V.''' \u2013 Red Striker Beetleborg's air-borne A.V.\n*** '''Gargantis the Attack Mobile Carrier''' \u2013 Most powerful attack vehicle the Beetleborgs had, it can open its back so the smaller A.V.s can ride atop of it for the Gargantis Mega Cannon. Gargantis was destroyed by the powerful Borgslayer at the end of the first season.\n* '''Battle Vehicles''' \u2013 The B.V.'s are the Beetleborgs' heavy artillery to use when the city is attacked by Crustacean Jet Fighters & Worm Tanks. Housed in the Beetle Battle Station.\n** '''Chromium Gold B.V.''' \u2013 Chromium Gold Beetleborg's B.V.\n** '''Titanium Silver B.V.''' \u2013 Titanium Silver Beetleborg's B.V.\n** '''Platinum Purple B.V.''' \u2013 Platinum Purple Beetleborg's air-borne B.V.\n\n===Battleborgs===\n* '''Roboborg''' (voiced by [[Michael Sorich]]) \u2013 Arrived on Earth when all eight of the Astral Coins were reunited with the Astral Sword. Roboborg is summoned when the Chromium Gold Beetleborg holds the Astral Sword in the air and shouts \"Roboborg!\" He wields a weapon called Robo Sword with which he can perform the ''Robo Cyclone''.\n* '''Boron''' (voiced by Y.I. Otta) \u2013 Les Fortunes created the Astral Axe (the evil counterpart to the Astral Sword) and, with it, Roboborg's evil counterpart Boron. Used by Mega Nukus to summon Boron simply by shouting out \"Boron, Arise!\" He wields an unnamed weapon similar to that of Roboborg's Robo Sword. In the battle against Repgillian, the Beetleborgs tricked the Crustaceans into giving up the Astral Axe so it could fall into the hands of Titanium Silver Beetleborg. In the possession of the Beetleborgs, Boron then switched to the side of good and helped Roboborg destroy Repgillian.\n\n==Production==\nIt was not uncommon to see cardboard cut-outs and wall decorations of the Beetleborgs characters on the walls of Zoom Comics where the three kids worked. Other decorations used included the costume heads of King Sphinx of ''[[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers]]'' and the original head from the monster costume Kappa from ''[[Ninja Sentai Kakuranger]]'' (the monster was used as \"Parrot Top\" in ''MMPR'') whose body was used to create the costume Malavex. Toys from the Bandai Beetleborgs toyline could also be seen in various displays. Including the Special Edition Deluxe Shadowborg figure, in an episode which preceded Shadowborg's character ever appearing on the show.\n\nLike other adaptations, some of the original source footage was altered for ''Beetleborgs''. The Input Magnums, the original B-Fighter's guns, looked very realistic due to the black-and-silver coloring. In ''Beetleborgs'', the gun's colors were changed to bright red and purple, and all Japanese footage of the Input Magnum's keypad being used was replaced with American footage using the red and purple gun. However, the colors of the guns changed from time to time due to the blending in of the B-Fighter footage. Similarly, the American version of the toy was done in red and purple colors instead of the Input Magnum's black and silver coloring. In ''Metallix'', the Input Cardgun colors remained unchanged (grey and black), but the toy line changed the weapons to a white-and-blue color scheme. More violent scenes from ''B-Fighter'' were either covered up with large, ''Batman''-esque sound effects or were cut out through comic-book-panel transitions.\n\nThe episode \"Convention Dimension\" had The Beetleborgs attending the comic convention. Among costumes worn at the convention were: Spider-Man, The Tick and Guido Anchovy. At that time Saban owned airing rights to ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'', ''[[The Tick (1994 TV series)|The Tick]]'' and ''[[Samurai Pizza Cats]]''. In Episode 54, Saban featured in \"Gravesoul Owns.\"\n\n''Big Bad Beetleborgs'' and ''Beetleborgs Metallix'' ultimately ended because the Saban crew were left with no more ''[[Juukou B-Fighter]]'' and ''[[B-Fighter Kabuto]]'' footage to adapt. Their predecessor ''[[VR Troopers]]'' also ended for the same reason.\n\n===Music===\nThe show's theme music was performed by Jeremy Sweet and series star Billy Forester. A newer version of the song was made for the ''Beetleborgs Metallix'' episodes. The background score, composed by [[Inon Zur]], had several cues which were also used on Saban's concurrent ''[[Power Rangers Turbo]]''. Currently, ''Beetleborgs'' has never had any official soundtrack releases.\n\n===Reuse of Monsters===\nVarious monster suits from both Beetleborgs seasons were re-used along with un-used ''[[Juukou B-Fighter]]'' and ''[[B-Fighter Kabuto]]'' monsters as enemy monsters in the Power Rangers series:\n\n* In ''[[Power Rangers in Space]]'', Terror Bear, Triplesaurus Rex, a Stego Dreg, Count Fangula's Bat Monster form, and unused B-Fighter Kabuto monster Baeria (who was repainted and referred to as \"Aunt Ant\" by Darkonda) were seen at the Onyx Tavern in \"Flashes of Darkonda.\" In \"Invasion of the Body Switcher,\" the monsters Body Switcher transformed into included Rocket Man, Cataclaws, LottaMuggs, Unctuous, and Firecat. In \"A Date with Danger,\" Mole Monster was used as Destructoid where the monster suit was given a different hair style. In the two-part episode \"Countdown to Destruction,\" Aqualungs, Cataclazmic, Crimson Creep, Furocious, Kombat Knat, LottaMuggs, Porkasaurus, Torch Mouth, Triplesaurus Rex, Ultra Vulture, and Unctuous were each seen with each army. Unused B-Fighter monsters Isogilala, Kapparapa, and Pineappler also appeared in the episode.\n* In [[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]] and Saban Entertainment's ''[[Men in White (1998 film)|Men in White]]'', the costumes for Kombat Knat and Furocious were used as two of the aliens that work for Glaxxon.\n* In ''[[Power Rangers Lost Galaxy]]'', a Stego Dreg, Cataclaws, and Ultra Vulture were seen at the Onyx Tavern. Cataclaws and Furocious were seen at the auction of the Pink Quasar Saber there. Unused B-Fighter Kabuto monster Tokasuzura also appeared as Rojomon.\n* Some of the monsters costumes from Beetleborgs appeared in ''[[Mystic Knights of Tir Na Nog]]'' with some of them in repainted form. Among these costumes are Scorpix, Shellator, Emily the Seed of Evil, Count Fangula's Bat Monster form, and 2 monsters from B-Fighter Kabuto that were unused in this series (the ant monster Baeria and the porcupine/stingray monster Arajibiray). The costumes for Shellator, Count Fangula's Bat Monster form, and B-Fighter monsters Baeria and Arajibiray were used to portray the Spectres of the Banshee Woods in \"The Mystic Knight of Forest.\" The costume for Emily the Seed of Evil was repainted and used for an unnamed spikey warrior in \"Ivar's Revenge.\"\n* In ''[[Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue]]'', Emily the Seed of Evil, Hagfish of Gar, and Torch Mouth were seen in the Shadow World in \"The Fate of Lightspeed\" Pt. 2.\n* Five Beetleborgs suits were re-used in the ''[[Power Rangers Wild Force]]'' episode ''[[Forever Red]]'' as remnants of the [[Machine Empire]] who would plan to reactivate Serpentera. Shadowborg's suit was used for General Venjix, Ladyborg's suit was used for Tezzla, Green Hunter Borg's suit was used for Gerrok, Dragonborg's suit was used for Steelon with the dragonfly wings on the head not being seen, and Automon has the head of Fireborg and the body of Lightningborg.\n* In ''[[Power Rangers S.P.D.]]''. Mucant appeared at Piggy's diner in \"Shadow\" Pt. 1. El Scorpio was re-used in the episode \"S.W.A.T.\" Part 1 as the holographic sea scorpion monster that Sergent Silverback used as a way to train the Rangers to use S.W.A.T. Mode.\n\n===On location===\nThe show was filmed in a number of locations.\n\n* Much of the show was filmed in [[Santa Paula, California]], a small rural town in [[Ventura County]].\n\n==''Power Rangers Turbo vs. Beetleborgs Metallix''==\nIn 1997, [[Acclaim Comics]] published a one-shot entitled ''Power Rangers Turbo vs. Beetleborgs Metallix'' featuring the Beetleborgs battling the [[Power Rangers Turbo|Turbo Rangers]] before teaming with them against Divatox and Nukus.\n\n==Release history==\nAfter ending a two-season run on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network, the series was rerun on [[UPN Kids]] from 1998 to 1999.

The house is revealed to be the home of real monsters in the likes of [[Universal monsters]] and are set to eat the kids. However, in the midst of a chase, the kids accidentally bump a [[pipe organ]], releasing a [[Ghost|phasm]] named Flabber (Billy Forester). He proves to be friendly, and in return for releasing him, offers to grant them one wish. They wish to become their comic book heroes, the Big Bad Beetleborgs. However, this also brings the Beetleborgs' sworn enemies to life: the Magnavores, led by the evil Vexor, who would summon monsters from the comic books to battle the Beetleborgs. Roland's mom and dad run the comic book shop along with his grandmother Nano. \n\nIn a 6-parter, Vexor created his own Beetleborg, Shadowborg, which was a match for the Beetleborgs and briefly took their powers. They had to call a temporary Beetleborg (White Blaster Beetleborg) Josh Baldwin (Warren Berkow), and after Shadowborg was destroyed, Josh lost his powers. The Beetleborgs would meet the Beetleborgs comic creator, Art Fortunes, during this six-part story in order for him to create the White Blaster Beetleborg and the Mega Blue Beetleborg.\n\nIn the penultimate episode of the first season, the Magnavores steal a picture of a new villain named Nukus from Art Fortunes' office. They bring him to life to enlist his help in destroying the Beetleborgs. Nukus assists them by planning devastating attacks on the city and creating Borgslayer, a hybrid of all the Magnavore monsters. Unbeknownst to the Magnavores, Nukus was actually plotting to get rid of them. Nukus tells Van and Trip (who were fleeing Charterville during Borgslayer's attack to their father's country estate) how to defeat Borgslayer, and orders them to take the information to the Beetleborgs. They succeed in destroying Borgslayer, causing the Magnavores to be swept back into the comics.\n\n===Season 2===\nAt the start of Season 2, Nukus has challenged the Beetleborgs. Despite Art's warning that Nukus is too powerful, they face him anyway. Nukus quickly wipes them out, destroying their Beetleborgs armor, weapons, and powers in one fell swoop.\n\nThese events lead directly into the second season ''Beetleborgs Metallix''. Nukus discovers that his creator is actually Art's incarcerated brother Les Fortunes. Nukus busts Les out of prison and uses some of Les' drawings to summon his own group of villains called the Crustaceans. Les now serves Nukus by creating new monsters for him to use. In response to the rise of the Crustaceans, Art creates new powers, armor, vehicles, and weapons, which Flabber then brings to life again for the kids, who rechristen themselves as Beetleborgs Metallix, hence the title. \n\nThe battle between the Beetleborgs and the Crustaceans would later escalate after the Fortunes brothers unburied a time capsule containing the Lost Comic; a story both brothers worked on when they were children. Said story featured the Astral Sword that could summon and control the all-mighty Roboborg, if one manages to gather the eight Astral Coins. Nukus summons his own evil team of Borgs from the Lost Comic called the Mantrons, while the Beetleborgs are reinforced by the Astral Borgs. After a many battles, the Beetleborgs finally get their hands on the Astral Sword and all eight coins, using it to summon Roboborg, who, soonafter, demonstrates his powers by sending the Mantrons back to the Lost Comic.\n\nTo fight Roboborg, the Crustaceans eventually created their own giant robot named Boron, while Nukus and Vilor gain upgraded Mega forms. As a response to Nukus' and Vilor's new Mega forms, the Beetleborgs were given an upgrade by Roboborg who fused their Metallix powers with their original powers creating the Mega Spectra Beetleborgs. Vilor's \"mega\" form did not last long and he quietly returned to his original look without explanation. However, Mega Nukus retained his upgraded look.\n\nThe series concluded with the Beetleborgs gaining the enemy Boron as an ally, stripping Nukus of his greatest weapon during the fight against Repgillian. Les Fortunes makes the decision to return willingly to Charterville Prison, disabling Nukus' ability to create new monsters out of illustrations. With no known way of returning the Crustaceans to the comic world, the Beetleborgs were left with an unresolved final battle with what was left of their foes.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Beetleborgs===\n* '''Andrew \"Drew\" McCormick''' (portrayed by Wesley Barker) \u2013 The Blue Stinger Beetleborg, and later the Chromium Gold Beetleborg in the second season, is the leader of the Beetleborgs. He was granted the ability of [[Psychokinesis|telekinesis]] by Flabber, which he activated by pointing at an object and nodding his head. Drew received an upgrade, Mega Blue Beetleborg, after he used the energy axis that powered Shadowborg on his original armor. After Roboborg arrived, Drew received a new upgrade, Mega Spectra Chromium Gold Beetleborg, after Nukus and Vilor went Mega themselves. His armor was modeled after a [[Japanese rhinoceros beetle]].\n* '''Roland Williams''' (portrayed by Herbie Baez) \u2013 The Green Hunter Beetleborg, and later the Titanium Silver Beetleborg in the second season, his family owns a local [[comic book]] shop named Zoom Comics, where he, Jo, and Drew usually hang out. He was granted the ability of [[speed|super speed]] by Flabber, which he activated by snapping his fingers. After Roboborg arrived, Roland received an upgrade, Mega Spectra Titanium Silver Beetleborg, after Nukus and Vilor went Mega themselves. His armor was modeled after a [[stag beetle]].\n* '''Josephine \"Jo\" McCormick''' (portrayed by Shannon Chandler in episodes 1\u201339, Brittany Konarzewski in 39\u201388) \u2013 The Red Striker Beetleborg, and later the Platinum Purple Beetleborg in the second season, Drew's little sister, she was granted the ability of [[superhuman strength|super strength]] by Flabber, which she activated by cracking her knuckles. After Roboborg arrived, Jo received an upgrade, Mega Spectra Platinum Purple Beetleborg, after Nukus and Vilor went Mega themselves. Her Red Striker armor was modeled after a female Japanese rhinoceros beetle, and her Platinum Purple armor after a [[Coccinellidae|ladybug]]. Jo is often shown wearing a baseball cap backwards. A unique casting change occurred and instead of an official departure removing the character Jo from the cast, when Shannon Chandler left the series, her character remained. Halfway through Season 1, Wolfgang (while playing with a magic book) accidentally cast a spell that caused Jo to change in appearance. Brittany Konarzewski took over Chandler's role in the guise of actually being the original Jo with a new look and voice. To counteract this, Flabber used his magic to make her look and sound the way she always had, but it didn't work on anyone who actually watched the spell being cast. So the viewers, Flabber, Drew, Roland, and Jo herself could still see Jo in her new appearance, but the Hilhurst monsters as well as their family and friends saw her as she looked before. According to Flabber, the spell would eventually wear off (this didn't happen during the series).\n* '''Josh Baldwin''' (portrayed by Warren Berkow) \u2013 The White Blaster Beetleborg, granted the ability of [[invisibility]] by Flabber, which he activated by dusting his hands. He was on the team for a very short period of time. The White Blaster Beetleborg was created after Shadowborg, an evil clone of the Beetleborgs, stole their powers. He succeeded in getting their powers back. However, it was soon discovered that the White Blaster and Shadowborg were linked in a fashion of [[yin and yang]] (mainly because the White Blaster powers were created solely to battle Shadowborg), meaning if one was destroyed, the other would lose his power forever (it could be assumed that it didn't really bother him, seeing as he felt he couldn't handle a superhero life). Josh and Drew were rivals to fall for Heather. Josh accompanied the Beetleborgs in the final battle against Shadowborg, where he transformed for the final time. Shadowborg was defeated by Drew (in his Mega Blue Beetleborg form) and due to the link, Josh lost his powers at which point Josh returned to a normal life. Josh has suggested to Art Fortunes that he should include the White Blaster Beetleborg in his later comics alongside the Mega Blue Beetleborg form. Although he said that if the others ever needed him again, he'd be there (but this was the last we saw of him). It was slightly hinted that Jo had a crush on him. His armour was modeled after a [[Hercules beetle]].\n\n===Hillhurst Inhabitants===\nAn old mansion outside of Charterville had fallen into disrepair since the passing of Old Man Hillhurst and became home to some rather goofy monsters. With the exception of Flabber, all the monsters attempt to eat any humans who trespass in their home. As a running gag, they never learn their lesson about trying to go after the Beetleborgs who always manage to outwit or clobber them. Wolfgang and Little Ghoul later move in throughout the series.\n\n* '''Flabber''' (portrayed by Billy Forester) \u2013 As described above, Flabber is a [[Ghost|phantasm]] (phasm) who was trapped inside a [[pipe organ]], and was freed by the kids. Out of gratitude he granted their wish to become their comic book heroes, the Big Bad Beetleborgs. This event also unintentionally released the Magnavores. Flabber was released by playing 3 notes on the organ. (He later revealed that playing those same 3 notes, then playing them in reverse would re-entrap him inside the organ). He acts as an advisor and best friend, and offers needed magic to the kids when fighting the Magnavores, and later the Crustaceans, though his magic does not always work the way he may hope for it to work. He is the head of the Hillhurst Mansion and is usually the one to keep the house monsters in check. The producers of the show said that he was based on [[Elvis Presley]].\n* '''Mums''' (voiced by [[Michael Sorich]] in the pilot episode, performed by Blake Torney in later episodes) \u2013 Mums is a 5,000-year-old Egyptian [[Mummy (undead)|mummy]] that used to be a prince, but he can unwrap his bandages to reveal a \"[[Death (personification)|Grim Reaper]]\"-like form under his bandages (which only occurred once) and is considered more scary.{{efn|Mums' brief Reaper form is a recycled version of Shinigamian from ''Juukou B-Fighter''.}} He has 703 brothers and sisters. In \"Curse of the Mums' Tomb,\" two archaeologists came to return Mums to the crypt in which they found him in order to get rid of a curse placed on them upon waking him. He would need a \"magical beetle\", but using a Beetleborg would cause loss of their powers. In the same episode, Mums mentions that he was mummified alive after he was caught kissing [[Cleopatra]] in public. His mother also has a family heirloom that can turn others (such as Fangula) into monsters by shouting \"[[Eureka (word)|Eureka]]!\"\n* '''Frankenbeans''' (performed by David Fletcher) \u2013 Frankenbeans (called \"Frankie\" for short) is a strange, lumbering [[Frankenstein's monster]]-type monster. He was once kidnapped by the Magnavores on Halloween, and held for ransom in exchange for the Beetleborgs' Beetle Bonders. He allows Wolfie to stay in a dog house kept in his room. He has little ability to speak, often roaring or saying toddler-like sentences; in short, he's the more stupid of the monsters. He actually has no brain (literally), something that often causes a lot of jokes involving him (but a benefit in one episode, as it made him immune to the attack of the \"Brain-Sucker\" monster created by Nukus). His creator Dr. Baron von Frankenbeans showed up in a few episodes.\n* '''Count Fangula''' (portrayed by Joe Hackett) \u2013 Loosely modeled after [[Count Dracula]], Count Fangula is a [[vampire]] (albeit one of questionable aptitude in the [[Black magic|Dark Arts]]). He seems to be the only one to understand what Wolfie may be saying. He mentioned in Wolfie's introductory episode that they were roommates \"in the old country.\" He once succeeded into getting two victims in Van and Trip, temporarily turning them into vampires that were turned back to normal by kisses from Jo. If his victims quota is too low, a high ranking vampire will come to evaluate him like his boss Vlad did in \"Fangula's Last Bite.\" He's also known to have an ex-wife who he's very afraid of.\n* '''The Pipettes''' (portrayed by Traci Bellusci) \u2013 A multicolor spirit-like trio of ladies who live in the pipe organ. They look identical except for the colors. The Pipettes act as Flabber's back-up singers. They were dropped halfway through the first series.\n* '''Ghoulum''' (performed by Dan Letlow) \u2013 A living stone [[statue]] monster that resides in Hillhurst Mansion who often had little to say or do other than what statues do best, stand in place. While not the most active monster of Hillhurst Mansion on rare occasions, he would join in on the other monsters' mischief. In one episode, he was accidentally exposed to a \"Bad Potion\" turning him evil and causing him to grow to giant-size and fall under Noxic's control.\n* '''Wolfgang \"Wolfie\" Smith''' (performed by Frank Tahoe, voiced by [[Michael Sorich]] in the first appearance, [[Scott Page-Pagter]] in later appearances) \u2013 Wolfie is a [[werewolf]] and is treated more like a family dog than a monster at Hillhurst. His voice sounds similar to [[Scooby-Doo (character)|Scooby-Doo]]. Only Fangula can translate what Wolfie is saying most of the time since Fangula was once Wolfie's roommate. Probably the bravest and most cunning of the Hillhurst Monsters because he's the only one of the group who tangled with the bad guys at least once. Wolfie was once responsible for using a spellbook to accidentally change Jo's appearance which got him in trouble with Flabber. He bargained with the Beetleborgs to be let on a mission with them in exchange for the final Astralborg coin he was ransoming.\n* '''Little Ghoul''' (portrayed by Lina Godouse) \u2013 A [[Jawa (Star Wars)|Jawa]]-like [[ghoul]] who was the latest addition to the Hillhurst group in season two. She lives in the basement and rarely comes out. As the niece of the [[Death (personification)|Grim Reaper]], Little Ghoul is a grim reaper-in-training who loves collecting. She also has a short temper, which scares the other monsters even more than her true appearance under her hood. She has little to no respect for anyone. She does however have a great deal of respect for the Astralborgs. In one episode, she possessed a head that originally belonged to the [[Headless Horseman (Legend of Sleepy Hollow)|Headless Horseman]]. In another episode, Little Ghoul became attached to a monster she named Emily after it bloomed from the Seed of Evil which Horribelle had given her during her brief obsession with gardening.\n\n===Allies===\n* '''\"Nano\" Williams''' (portrayed by Vivian Smallwood) \u2013 Roland's grandmother, Aaron's mother, and Abbie's mother-in-law. Nano is one hip granny and a trained [[martial artist]]. When she's not running Zoom Comics or practicing her moves, she's often seen riding her motorcycle. Nano often helps out the kids when they're in a jam. If nothing else, she enjoys teasing her son Aaron.\n* '''Aaron Williams''' (portrayed by Kim Delgado) \u2013 Roland's father, Abbie's husband and Nano's son. He ran Zoom Comics full-time and is often embarrassed by his mother's antics. Aaron was soon called away on business halfway through Season One, leaving the shop in the hands of his wife Abbie.\n* '''Abbie Williams''' (portrayed by Channe Nolen) \u2013 Roland's mother and Nano's daughter-in-law. She primarily works as a [[real estate]] agent. When her husband, Aaron, gone on business, she assumed running Zoom Comics. She and her mother in-law don't see eye to eye but she didn't really know how to run a comic book shop. With a little help from Flabber's magic, Abbie's heart opened up and rekindled fond childhood memories of a comic she once loved reading. She ran the shop for the remainder of the series.\n* '''Heather''' (portrayed by Elizabeth Z. Lund) \u2013 Drew's crush. No matter what, Drew could never tell Heather what he really felt. She would sometimes help out at the comic shop, and she also enjoyed reading them. During the Shadowborg saga, she developed a crush on Josh.\n* '''Trip and Van''' (portrayed by Todd Hurst and Patrick Seaborn) \u2013 These brothers constantly pestered the kids daily lives by flaunting their wealth and self-acclaimed superiority. Trip was the smarter of the two whereas Van was a bit slow. They often came up with get-rich-quick schemes, ways to humiliate the kids, or simply to cause trouble where they would often dragging Dudley into their schemes. They were the one's who dared Jo, Roland, and Drew to enter Hillhurst, which led to them becoming Beetleborgs. During the Borgslayer fiascom they left town to go live at their father's country estate. Before they left town, Nukus forced them to return to town to tell the Beetleborgs how to defeat Borgslayer in order to get rid of the Magnavores. The two of them were dropped after Season One and are only mentioned once in Season Two.\n** '''Dudley''' (portrayed by Dudley Davis) \u2013 Dudley is the [[chauffeur]] who works for Trip and Van's parents. He would be unwittingly dragged into Trip and Van's schemes. Like Trip and Van, Dudley isn't seen again after Season One.\n* '''Dr. Baron von Frankenbeans''' (portrayed by Don Altman) \u2013 A [[mad scientist]] who is based on [[Victor Frankenstein]] and is the creator of Frankenbeans. He treated the monsters like servants. Whenever he announced his full name, he would be spotlighted by moonlight as lightning would flash and a wolf would howl outside (even if it was daylight). He first appeared to visit his son and do medical treatment on the monsters. Dr. Frankenbeans even helped the Beetleborgs by giving them a suggestion on how to defeat Cyber-Serpent by opening fire on him while he's standing over his comic. In \"Operation Frankenbeans,\" Dr. Frankenbeans returned where he implanted a new brain into Frankenbeans. While it made Frankenbeans smart, it also made him not see Dr. Frankenbeans as his father. This lasted until Frankenbeans fell down the stairs, hit his head, and go back to his original intellect. In \"Bride of Frankenbeans,\" Dr. Frankenbeans returned where he had assembled a mate for Frankenbeans (who was based off the [[Bride of Frankenstein (character)|Bride of Frankenstein]]). Even though the Beetleborgs stopped Crimson Creep from crashing the wedding, Frankenbeans' relationship with the \"bride\" was short and she was deactivated and dismantled. In \"Son of Frankenbeans,\" Dr. Frankenbeans returned where he had created a \"son\" for Frankenbeans. In \"Experiment of Evil,\" Dr. Frankenbeans created the \"Monster Mother: Root of all Evil\" for the Hillhurst monster who wanted to end the danger posed to their home. He claims that in order to defeat evil, one must be eviler.\n* '''Arthur \"Art\" Fortunes''' (portrayed by Rigg Kennedy) \u2013 Creator of the Beetleborgs comics who shows up time and time again with new ways to help the kids. He often collaborates with Flabber's magic to bring new arsenal to the kids. Art Fortunes has a brother named Les Fortunes where they had a sibling rivalry. When they were young, Art and Les had a brief collaboration on the \"Lost Comic\" where Art created the Astralborgs and Les created the Mantrons. A running gag is that the Hillhurst monsters focus on trying to eat him instead of the kids when they're out fighting the villains.\n* '''Karato''' (voiced by [[Richard Epcar]]) and '''Silver Ray''' \u2013 Two other comic book superheroes that the kids are fans of. When the Magnavores released an army of monsters while trying to kidnap Art Fortunes from a comic book convention, the Beetleborgs were afraid of being unable to beat them all by themselves. Flabber agreed to use his magic on just that one occasion to summon other superheroes from the comics to help. In B-Fighter, Karato was one of the other Metal Hero protagonists [[Tokusou Robo Janperson|Janperson]] while Silver Ray was his rival-turned ally Gun Gibson, and Goldex was the main villain Bill Goldy (used by the villains as a pawn after being revived), but was absorbed into Borgslayer. The B-Fighters also teamed up with the [[Blue SWAT]] team, but they weren't adapted into Beetleborgs.\n* '''Astralborgs''' \u2013 Four heroes of the Lost Comic that were created by Art Fortunes and Les Fortunes. When the Beetleborgs acquired their coins, they are able to summon the Astralborgs to help them fight Nukus' forces.\n** '''Dragonborg''' (voiced by [[Doug Stone (voice actor)|Doug Stone]] impersonating [[Sean Connery]]) \u2013 Modeled after a [[dragonfly]], Dragonborg is the leader of the Astralborgs. His astral laser comes with a powerful sting.\n** '''Fireborg''' (voiced by Gene Holliday) \u2013 An Astralborg that is modeled after a [[firefly]]. He can shoot balls of fire from his fingertips.\n** '''Lightingborg''' (voiced by [[Richard Epcar]]) \u2013 An Astralborg who is modeled after a [[cicada]]. He can shoot electrical currents from the blades of his two swords or the antennae on his helmet.\n** '''Ladyborg''' (voiced by [[Barbara Goodson]]) \u2013 An Astralborg who is modeled after a [[butterfly]]. Her large cannon opens up like a flower to fire a powerful beam.\n\n===Villains===\n* '''Magnavores''' (2\u201353) \u2013 The first set of villains the Beetleborgs faced, who originated from the Beetleborgs comic series. They were released due to Flabber granting the kids' wish which unintentionally released them. While in Charterville, the Magnavores use the old Charterville cemetery as their lair. By the end of Season One, the Magnavores were sent back into the comics as a side effect of Borgslayer's destruction.\n** '''Vexor''' (first performed by Rick Tane and later by Kisu, voiced by Joey Pal) \u2013 The leader of the Magnavores. He loses patience with his Magnavores' incompetence and does not appear in every episode. He appeared to have been destroyed by the combined efforts of all three Beetleborgs stabbing their Beetle Battlers into his body and pulling him to the ground, after Drew battled with and destroyed Shadowborg, but quickly revived himself, sprouting a new body and face and even managed to grow giant. In his following appearance, he somehow switched back to his old self/appearance.\n** '''Typhus''' (performed by Kyle Jordan, voiced by Dave \"Foots\" Footman) \u2013 A [[Chimera (mythology)|Chimera]]/composite-like humanoid monster, prefers brawn over brain and his [[whale]]-like flattop is an extra mouth with which he eats food or other objects. In battle, he sometimes wields a sword-like weapon that latches to his arm or his mouth. This weapon can also blast lasers when latched to his extra mouth. On one occasion, he emitted bees from his extra mouth. He was temporarily turned into Mega Typhus.\n** '''Noxic''' (performed by Lee Whey, voiced by [[Derek Stephen Prince|David Umansky]]) \u2013 An [[Android (robot)|android]] with coils for hair who wears a white labcoat-like jacket. He can control machinery and other objects by removing his head and attaching it to them. In a dream of his, Noxic took control of a bulldozer with his head and tried to destroy the Beetleborgs. He later used this same technique to take control of Ghoulum, when he went bad from the \"Bad Potion.\" He has an unseen wicked friend from the comic books as well named Dr. Cackle who created the Bad Potion. Noxic prefers to eat donuts all day long instead of doing Vexor's bidding. He has an older brother named Super Noxic though technically Noxic was created first. In battle, he sometimes wields an umbrella-like weapon.\n** '''Jara''' (performed by Balinda English in U.S. Footage, voiced by Rajia Baroudi) - A female humanoid clad in red attire and a white mask. She speaks with a Russian accent. Despite her face being remade 3-dimensional, she cannot consume food or smile in the real world because the mouth on her mask could never open (she emphasizes this by saying that she has no mouth). She was bitten by Wolfgang in one episode and became a werewolf and enamored with Wolfgang. By the end of the episode, Jara was returned to her normal form by a rubber arrow shot by Flabber which contained antidote and retained none of her affection for Wolfgang. In battle, she sometimes wields a whip that when cracked releases destructive energy.\n** '''Shadowborg''' (voiced by [[Bob Papenbrook]]) (26\u201331) \u2013 A black evil Beetleborg created by Vexor from ionic DNA and insectite material stolen from the Blue Stinger Beetleborg. Not only is Shadowborg created from the basic materials as Blue Stinger, but he is enhanced with some of the powers of the other Beetleborgs. Shadowborg can run faster than the Green Hunter, jump higher than Red Striker, and remain underwater for 51 minutes. Shadowborg's architectural armor is modeled after a [[Longhorn beetle|longicorn beetle]]. With his Shadow Claw, Shadowborg can cut through any substance known to the planet. He was finally destroyed by the Blue Stinger Beetleborg in his Mega Blue Form.\n** '''Scabs''' (3\u201353) \u2013 Yellow-black creatures who are the [[Infantry|foot soldiers]] of the Magnavores. Unlike in most Saban adaptations, these grunt soldiers were barely used.\n** '''Magnavore Jet Fighters''' (3\u201353)- Air-borne, wasp-resembling machine jets. Summoned to attack the Beetleborgs on several occasions.\n* '''\"Crustaceans\"''' (52\u201388) \u2013 Villains created by Les Fortunes, the second set of villains the Beetleborgs faced. After the Magnavores were defeated, the \"Crustaceans\" used the old Charterville cemetery as their lair.\n** '''Nukus''' (performed and voiced by Christopher Cho) (52\u201381) \u2013 A creation of Les Fortunes, Nukus is the [[Triceratops]]-based ''Overlord of the 2nd Dimension''. His drawing was hidden away in Art Fortune's vault until the Magnavores took the picture and Vexor brought him to life. Nukus quickly set a plan to dispose the Magnavores and take over as the new villain which involved combining the energies of the monsters he brought out into Borgslayer. When Borgslayer was destroyed, the Magnavores returned to the comics and Nukus went to confront the Beetleborgs. Nukus had an advantage over the Beetleborgs as he destroyed both the paper he came out of. Nukus also destroyed the Beetleborgs' original armor, weapons, and powers. When he raided Hillhurst, Nukus turned Flabber into ice and discovered Art Fortunes with another picture of Nukus which was actually drawn by his brother Les. With this knowledge, Nukus broke Les out of prison, brought Horribelle, Vilor, and the Dregs to life, and used Les' skills to create deadly monsters that could be brought to life with the use of his sword where he would say the name of Les' creation and quote \"Arise\" where the drawing came to life. He later gained a mega form called '''Mega Nukus''' (81\u201388) from touching Les Fortunes' transmographier device which he destroyed soon after to ensure no one else received an upgrade from it.\n** '''Horribelle''' (performed and voiced by Claudine Barros) (54\u201388) \u2013 [[Second-in-command]] of the Crustaceans, an [[insect]]-based sword-toting fighter and Nukus' right-hand woman upon being brought to life by Nukus from Les' drawing of her. Like Nukus, she can summon a face-mask in battle. She also wields two swords that resemble mantis arms. Horribelle once rebelled against the Crustaceans by having Les Fortunes create the Astral Axe, so she could control its powers out of a scorn for not receiving a mega form like the main male villains.\n** '''Vilor''' (performed by Kyle Jordan, voiced by Dave \"Foots\" Footman) (54\u201388) \u2013 Third-in-command of the Crustaceans, a [[fish]]-based and trident-toting fighter. He was created by Les in prison and brought to life by Nukus. Vilor briefly gains a second form called '''Super Vilor''' in \"Wolfie's Wild Ride\" in which while the Mantrons takeover fighting, he makes Les Fortunes a deal: a new form in exchange for a new drawing table. Vilor manages to persuade Nukus to make this upgrade happen. When defeated Super Vilor returned to where the drawing was made, he falls on Les Fortunes' new drawing table as regular Vilor. Later, Vilor got a brief mega form called '''Mega Vilor''' (81) after touching Les Fortunes' transmographier device prior to its destruction. Though he somehow reverted to his normal state.\n** '''Lester \"Les\" Fortunes''' (portrayed by Marshal Hilton) (54\u201388) \u2013 The [[black sheep]] in the Fortunes family and Art's older brother who has the same artistic talents as his brother. When they were young, Les and Art had a brief collaboration on the \"Lost Comic\" where Art created the Astralborgs and Les created the Mantrons. Les was responsible for drawing the picture of Nukus which the Magnavores brought to life. He was in prison when Nukus recruited him to his cause. Despite creating Horribelle, Vilor, the Dregs, and all the Crustacean monsters and their arsenal, Les never gets any respect or credit for it. After Repgillian's destruction, Les and Nukus decided to finally part ways after Les decided to go back to jail for some peace and quiet. He remarked that the Crustaceans were going to miss him while stating that he created them and he can erase them. As he left, Horribelle remarked she never really did like him.\n** '''Mantrons''' (75\u201382) \u2013 Evil counterparts of the Astralborgs. Created by Les Fortunes as a child to rival Art Fortunes' Astralborgs in their only collaboration the Lost Comic. They were there to aid Nukus in his plans to get Roboborg who ultimately made it to the good hands of the Beetleborgs. In \"Roboborg\" (part 8 of the Lost Comic saga), the Mantrons were finally sent back to the Lost Comic for good by the combined attacks of the Beetleborgs, Astralborgs, and Roboborg.\n*** '''Scorpix''' (voiced by [[Bob Papenbrook]]) \u2013 Modeled after a [[scorpion]], Scorpix is the leader of the Mantrons.\n*** '''Centipix''' (voiced by Lee Hondo Woodford) \u2013 A Mantron that is modeled after a [[centipede]].\n*** '''Mantix''' (voiced by [[Ezra Weisz|Ethan Murray]]) \u2013 A Mantron that is modeled after a [[mantis]].\n*** '''Hornix''' (voiced by [[Neil Kaplan|Bob Johnson]]) \u2013 A Mantron that is modeled after a [[hornet]].\n** '''Dregs''' (55\u201388) \u2013 Assorted monsters used as foot soldiers that were created by Les Fortunes when he was in jail and brought to life by Nukus. Dregs came in two groups. One group was based on land animals and wore brown slacks and black boots (consisting of the [[Pteranodon|Ptera]] Dreg, the [[Spider]] Dreg, and the [[Stegoceras|Stego]] Dreg). The other based on sea creatures and wore blue spandex pants and white boots (consisting of the [[Fish]] Dreg, [[Jellyfish]] Dreg, [[Squid]] Dreg).\n** '''Worm Tanks''' (55\u201388) \u2013 Giant worm like vehicles summoned to attack the Beetleborgs on several occasions.\n** '''Crustacean Jet Fighters''' (56\u201388) \u2013 Air-borne machines based on the design of the Worm Tank summoned to attack the Beetleborgs on several occasions.\n\n====Monsters====\n{{main|List of Beetleborgs monsters}}\n\n==Arsenal==\n\n===Big Bad Beetleborgs===\n* '''Beetle Bonders''' \u2013 The Beetleborgs' transformation devices. Once summoned, the kids transformed into the Beetleborgs with a cry of \"Beetle Blast!\" To change back, the kids say \"Back Blast!\"\n* '''Sonic Laser Saber'''\n** '''Sonic Lasers''' \u2013 The Beetleborgs' fire-arms, complete with a 12-button numbered keypad to type in codes for attacks.\n** '''Pulsabers''' \u2013 Small swords used by the Beetleborgs.

Utilizing dual pistol and shotgun modes, this weapon also helps transform Blue Stinger Beetleborg into the Mega Blue Beetleborg.\n\n===Beetleborgs Metallix===\n* '''\"Bug Out\"''' \u2013 In the first episode of Metallix (or the last episode of Big Bad BeetleBorgs), Drew and his teammates use Flabber's book of spells (or Phasm Handbook) to try to change him back to normal after Nukus turns him to ice. One spell gives all three the power to change into somewhat larger versions of their respective insects (about the size of their fists), then revert to human. By saying \"Bug out!\", they change into bugs. To become human again, they say \"Bug back!\" The trio are able to use this ability in either human or Beetleborg form, and will never lose it. When in insect mode, their colors are the same as those on their new Metallix armor.\n* '''Data Bonders''' \u2013 The Beetleborgs' transformation devices. Unlike the Beetle Bonders, the kids had to insert Input Cards into the Data Bonders after they were summoned. The kids transformed into the Metallix Beetleborgs with a cry of \"Beetle Blast!\". To change back, the kids say \"Back Blast!\" The Data Bonders and their Input Cards could also be used to summon their Sector Cycles (in both regular and Mega Spectra modes).\n* '''Metallix Battlers''' \u2013 The Beetleborgs' main weapons of their own design;\n** '''Metallix Lancer''' \u2013 The Chromium Gold Beetleborg's weapon.\n** '''Metallix Grappler''' \u2013 The Titanium Silver Beetleborg's weapon.

Housed in the Beetle Battle Base, minus Gargantis. The Beetle Battle Base and the A.V.'s were destroyed by the Magnavore Jet Fighters' missiles at the end of the first season.\n** '''Gargantis Mega Cannon''' \u2013 Combination of the Beetleborgs A.V.'s and Gargantis. It is their most powerful weapon of all.\n*** '''Blue Stinger A.V.''' \u2013 Blue Stinger Beetleborg's A.V.\n*** '''Green Hunter A.V.''' \u2013 Green Hunter Beetleborg's A.V.\n*** '''Red Striker A.V.''' \u2013 Red Striker Beetleborg's air-borne A.V.\n*** '''Gargantis the Attack Mobile Carrier''' \u2013 Most powerful attack vehicle the Beetleborgs had, it can open its back so the smaller A.V.s can ride atop of it for the Gargantis Mega Cannon.

Roboborg is summoned when the Chromium Gold Beetleborg holds the Astral Sword in the air and shouts \"Roboborg!\" He wields a weapon called Robo Sword with which he can perform the ''Robo Cyclone''.\n* '''Boron''' (voiced by Y.I. Otta) \u2013 Les Fortunes created the Astral Axe (the evil counterpart to the Astral Sword) and, with it, Roboborg's evil counterpart Boron. Used by Mega Nukus to summon Boron simply by shouting out \"Boron, Arise!\" He wields an unnamed weapon similar to that of Roboborg's Robo Sword. In the battle against Repgillian, the Beetleborgs tricked the Crustaceans into giving up the Astral Axe so it could fall into the hands of Titanium Silver Beetleborg. In the possession of the Beetleborgs, Boron then switched to the side of good and helped Roboborg destroy Repgillian.\n\n==Production==\nIt was not uncommon to see cardboard cut-outs and wall decorations of the Beetleborgs characters on the walls of Zoom Comics where the three kids worked. Other decorations used included the costume heads of King Sphinx of ''[[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers]]'' and the original head from the monster costume Kappa from ''[[Ninja Sentai Kakuranger]]'' (the monster was used as \"Parrot Top\" in ''MMPR'') whose body was used to create the costume Malavex. Toys from the Bandai Beetleborgs toyline could also be seen in various displays. Including the Special Edition Deluxe Shadowborg figure, in an episode which preceded Shadowborg's character ever appearing on the show.\n\nLike other adaptations, some of the original source footage was altered for ''Beetleborgs''. The Input Magnums, the original B-Fighter's guns, looked very realistic due to the black-and-silver coloring. In ''Beetleborgs'', the gun's colors were changed to bright red and purple, and all Japanese footage of the Input Magnum's keypad being used was replaced with American footage using the red and purple gun. However, the colors of the guns changed from time to time due to the blending in of the B-Fighter footage. Similarly, the American version of the toy was done in red and purple colors instead of the Input Magnum's black and silver coloring. In ''Metallix'', the Input Cardgun colors remained unchanged (grey and black), but the toy line changed the weapons to a white-and-blue color scheme. More violent scenes from ''B-Fighter'' were either covered up with large, ''Batman''-esque sound effects or were cut out through comic-book-panel transitions.\n\nThe episode \"Convention Dimension\" had The Beetleborgs attending the comic convention. Among costumes worn at the convention were: Spider-Man, The Tick and Guido Anchovy. At that time Saban owned airing rights to ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'', ''[[The Tick (1994 TV series)|The Tick]]'' and ''[[Samurai Pizza Cats]]''. In Episode 54, Saban featured in \"Gravesoul Owns.\"\n\n''Big Bad Beetleborgs'' and ''Beetleborgs Metallix'' ultimately ended because the Saban crew were left with no more ''[[Juukou B-Fighter]]'' and ''[[B-Fighter Kabuto]]'' footage to adapt. Their predecessor ''[[VR Troopers]]'' also ended for the same reason.\n\n===Music===\nThe show's theme music was performed by Jeremy Sweet and series star Billy Forester. A newer version of the song was made for the ''Beetleborgs Metallix'' episodes. The background score, composed by [[Inon Zur]], had several cues which were also used on Saban's concurrent ''[[Power Rangers Turbo]]''. Currently, ''Beetleborgs'' has never had any official soundtrack releases.\n\n===Reuse of Monsters===\nVarious monster suits from both Beetleborgs seasons were re-used along with un-used ''[[Juukou B-Fighter]]'' and ''[[B-Fighter Kabuto]]'' monsters as enemy monsters in the Power Rangers series:\n\n* In ''[[Power Rangers in Space]]'', Terror Bear, Triplesaurus Rex, a Stego Dreg, Count Fangula's Bat Monster form, and unused B-Fighter Kabuto monster Baeria (who was repainted and referred to as \"Aunt Ant\" by Darkonda) were seen at the Onyx Tavern in \"Flashes of Darkonda.\" In \"Invasion of the Body Switcher,\" the monsters Body Switcher transformed into included Rocket Man, Cataclaws, LottaMuggs, Unctuous, and Firecat. In \"A Date with Danger,\" Mole Monster was used as Destructoid where the monster suit was given a different hair style. In the two-part episode \"Countdown to Destruction,\" Aqualungs, Cataclazmic, Crimson Creep, Furocious, Kombat Knat, LottaMuggs, Porkasaurus, Torch Mouth, Triplesaurus Rex, Ultra Vulture, and Unctuous were each seen with each army. Unused B-Fighter monsters Isogilala, Kapparapa, and Pineappler also appeared in the episode.\n* In [[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]] and Saban Entertainment's ''[[Men in White (1998 film)|Men in White]]'', the costumes for Kombat Knat and Furocious were used as two of the aliens that work for Glaxxon.\n* In ''[[Power Rangers Lost Galaxy]]'', a Stego Dreg, Cataclaws, and Ultra Vulture were seen at the Onyx Tavern. Cataclaws and Furocious were seen at the auction of the Pink Quasar Saber there. Unused B-Fighter Kabuto monster Tokasuzura also appeared as Rojomon.\n* Some of the monsters costumes from Beetleborgs appeared in ''[[Mystic Knights of Tir Na Nog]]'' with some of them in repainted form. Among these costumes are Scorpix, Shellator, Emily the Seed of Evil, Count Fangula's Bat Monster form, and 2 monsters from B-Fighter Kabuto that were unused in this series (the ant monster Baeria and the porcupine/stingray monster Arajibiray). The costumes for Shellator, Count Fangula's Bat Monster form, and B-Fighter monsters Baeria and Arajibiray were used to portray the Spectres of the Banshee Woods in \"The Mystic Knight of Forest.\" The costume for Emily the Seed of Evil was repainted and used for an unnamed spikey warrior in \"Ivar's Revenge.\"\n* In ''[[Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue]]'', Emily the Seed of Evil, Hagfish of Gar, and Torch Mouth were seen in the Shadow World in \"The Fate of Lightspeed\" Pt. 2.\n* Five Beetleborgs suits were re-used in the ''[[Power Rangers Wild Force]]'' episode ''[[Forever Red]]'' as remnants of the [[Machine Empire]] who would plan to reactivate Serpentera. Shadowborg's suit was used for General Venjix, Ladyborg's suit was used for Tezzla, Green Hunter Borg's suit was used for Gerrok, Dragonborg's suit was used for Steelon with the dragonfly wings on the head not being seen, and Automon has the head of Fireborg and the body of Lightningborg.\n* In ''[[Power Rangers S.P.D.]]''. Mucant appeared at Piggy's diner in \"Shadow\" Pt. 1. El Scorpio was re-used in the episode \"S.W.A.T.\" Part 1 as the holographic sea scorpion monster that Sergent Silverback used as a way to train the Rangers to use S.W.A.T. Mode.\n\n===On location===\nThe show was filmed in a number of locations.\n\n* Much of the show was filmed in [[Santa Paula, California]], a small rural town in [[Ventura County]].\n\n==''Power Rangers Turbo vs. Beetleborgs Metallix''==\nIn 1997, [[Acclaim Comics]] published a one-shot entitled ''Power Rangers Turbo vs. Beetleborgs Metallix'' featuring the Beetleborgs battling the [[Power Rangers Turbo|Turbo Rangers]] before teaming with them against Divatox and Nukus.\n\n==Release history==\nAfter ending a two-season run on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network, the series was rerun on [[UPN Kids]] from 1998 to 1999. In Australia, ''Big Bad Beetleborgs'' began airing on [[Network Ten]]'s [[Cheez TV]] morning block during February 1998.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ebroadcast.com.au/TV/mag/news/AustralianNews/ItsToonTime.html|title=Australian News - It's Toon Time|website=www.ebroadcast.com.au}}</ref> In Europe, the series aired on the international version of [[Fox Kids Europe|Fox Kids]], which was later rebranded as [[Jetix]].  On May 7, 2010, as part of the sale of the ''[[Power Rangers]]'' franchise, the copyright for Beetleborgs was transferred from [[Disney-ABC Domestic Television|BVS Entertainment]] to [[Saban Capital Group]].\n\nOn June 15, 2011. all episodes of ''Big Bad Beetleborgs'' and ''Beetleborgs Metallix'' were made available on [[Netflix]].\n\nThere have been 3 VHS releases in the US and Australia: ''The Curse of Shadow Borg'', ''The Vampire Files'', and ''Metallix \u2013 The Movie''.

The castle has been recently renovated and is under new ownership. The building is open to the public.\n\n==Architecture==\nThe [[Queen Anne style architecture in the United States|Queen Anne style]] house was designed by C. A. Gombert of [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]].  The $72,000 building costs included seven baths (one with a thirteen-head shower), an elevator, a third-floor ballroom, and a hot tub on the roof (added later). The castle's exterior was constructed of [[Lake Superior]] [[sandstone]] and [[brick]], and the interior wood included [[mahogany]], bird's eye [[maple]], quartered [[oak]], [[birch]], and [[American sycamore]]. The castle was built with 25 rooms in all and exemplified the most expensive tastes of the time.\n\n==History==\nThe history of the home began with Frank Henderson. Mr. Henderson was one of early Kalamazoo's most successful businessmen. He was the owner and president of [[Henderson-Ames Company]]. Henderson-Ames made uniform regalia for secret societies, fraternal organizations, and the military. Mr. Henderson's wife, Mary, had inherited a plot of undeveloped land on the western edge of Kalamazoo before the company's large success and Mr. Henderson dreamt of a grand suburb on this land. Allowing that dream to come to fruition, in 1888, he enlisted the help of surveyors, engineers, and landscape architects to plot the land and create Kalamazoo's first \"natural site plan\". In 1890, Mr. Henderson was ready to build his home in his new residential district.\n\nThe Henderson's had a grand housewarming party in 1895 at the completion of the castle's construction. Mr. Henderson died in 1899, however, his wife remained at the castle until she died in 1907. The castle was inherited by the Henderson children and it wasn't until 1919 that it was sold out of the family. Ten parties have owned Henderson Castle. Bertrand Hopper, President and Treasurer of Kalamazoo Stationery Company was the first.\n\nIn the 1920s, Hopper converted the brick stable on the property to a four car garage; it has since been transformed into a separate residence. After being vacant for several years, [[William Stuifbergen]] purchased the house in 1945, and divided it into several apartments. He and his family resided in one of the units.\n\nIn 1957, the house was deeded to the First National Bank, as trustee. The castle was considered for the Art Institute, but became the property of the renowned liberal arts school, [[Kalamazoo College]], where the campus lies just a block to the south of the castle's grounds.\n\nIn 1975, Dr. Jess Walker bought the house and began a restoration process that continued under Frederick Royce, who purchased the property in 1981. He then was a guest star on [[House Hunters International]], and sold the castle and moved to [[Buenos Aires, Argentina]] in 2005.\n\nLaura and Peter Livingstone-McNelis obtained the home in 2005, and maintained it as open to the public (running the bed and breakfast Royce had started). It was purchased in 2010 by Robert Jackson and sold to Francois Moyet, a Master French chef, who has continued the operation of the bed and breakfast since he purchased it in 2011. He has also started a fine French dining restaurant inside the home, as well as a spa, named \"Mary Henderson's Spa\".\n\nAlso of interest, the castle was the setting for a science fiction movie filmed in Kalamazoo.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.hendersoncastle.com/ Henderson Castle Homepage] \n** Ownership and sale information from \"Henderson Castle - Kalamazoo's Legacy\" published in May 2013.

It was formed from the [[nationalisation]] of the [[Big Four (British railway companies)|\"Big Four\" British railway companies]] and lasted until the gradual [[privatisation of British Rail]], in stages between 1994 and 1997.

After the grouping of 1923 under the [[Railways Act 1921]], there were four large railway companies, each dominating its own geographic area: the [[Great Western Railway]] (GWR), the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]] (LMS), the [[London and North Eastern Railway]] (LNER) and the [[Southern Railway (UK)|Southern Railway]] (SR).

The Executive itself had been abolished in 1953 by the Conservative government, and control of BR transferred to the parent Commission.

BR's design panel set up a working party led by [[Milner Gray (designer)|Milner Gray]] of the [[Design Research Unit]]. They drew up [[British Rail Corporate Identity Manual|a Corporate Identity Manual]] which established a coherent brand and design standard for the whole organisation, specifying [[Rail Blue]] and pearl grey as the standard colour scheme for all rolling stock; [[Rail Alphabet]] as the standard corporate typeface, designed by [[Jock Kinneir]] and [[Margaret Calvert]]; and introducing the now-iconic Corporate Identity Symbol of the \"Double Arrow\" logo. Designed by Gerald Barney (also of the DRU), this arrow device was formed of two interlocked arrows across two parallel lines, symbolising a double track railway. It was likened to a bolt of [[lightning]] or [[barbed wire]], and also acquired a nickname: \"the arrow of indecision\". A mirror image of the double arrow was used on the [[port side]] of BR-owned [[Sealink]] ferry funnels.  The new BR corporate identity and Double Arrow were rolled out in 1965, and the brand name of the organisation was truncated to \"British Rail\".{{sfn|Jackson|2013}}{{sfn|Height|Cresswell|1979}}\n\n=== Post-1960s ===\n\nThe uniformity of BR branding continued until the process of [[sectorisation]] was introduced in the 1980s. Certain BR operations such as [[InterCity (British Rail)|Inter-City]], [[Network SouthEast]], [[Regional Railways]] or [[Railfreight]] began to adopt their own identities, introducing logos and colour schemes which were essentially variants of the British Rail brand. Eventually, as sectorisation developed into a prelude to privatisation, the unified British Rail brand disappeared, with the notable exception of the Double Arrow symbol, which has survived to this day and serves as a [[generic trademark]] to denote railway services across Great Britain.{{sfn|Jackson|2013}} The BR Corporate Identity Manual is noted as a piece of British [[design history]] and there are plans for it to be re-published.<ref>{{cite news |title=Is the British Rail logo a design icon? |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-35144496 |work=BBC News |accessdate=20 December 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151220132046/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-35144496 |archivedate=20 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Finances ==\n\nDespite its nationalisation in 1947 \"as one of the 'commanding heights' of the economy\",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rail.co.uk/british-railway-history/british-railways/ |title=History of Railways in Britain |work=Rail.co.uk |accessdate=27 November 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151207124639/http://www.rail.co.uk/british-railway-history/british-railways/ |archive-date=7 December 2015 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> according to some sources British Rail was not profitable for most (if not all)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rail.co.uk/british-railway-history/ |title=History of the British Railway |work=Rail.co.uk |accessdate=27 November 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151128090614/http://www.rail.co.uk/british-railway-history/ |archive-date=28 November 2015 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> of its history.<ref>{{cite book |title=British Railways 1948\u201373: A Business History |first=T.

Services to France, Belgium, and the Netherlands were run by Sealink UK as part of the Sealink consortium which also used ferries owned by French national railways ([[SNCF]]), the Belgian Maritime Transport Authority [[Regie voor Maritiem Transport]]/Regie des transports maritimes (RMT/RTM) and the Dutch [[Stoomvaart Maatschappij Zeeland]] (Zeeland Steamship Company).\n\nHistorically, the shipping services were exclusively an extension of the railways across the [[English Channel]] and the [[Irish Sea]] in order to provide through, integrated services to Europe and Ireland. As international travel became more popular in the late 1960s and before air travel became generally affordable, the responsibility for shipping services was taken away from the British Rail Regions and in 1969 centralised in a new division \u2013 British Rail Shipping and International Services Division.\n\nWith the advent of car ferry services, the old passenger-only ferries were gradually replaced by [[roll-on/roll-off]] ships, catering for motorists and rail passengers as well as road freight. However, given that there was now competition in the form of other ferry companies offering crossings to motorists, it became necessary to market the services in a normal business fashion (as opposed to the previous almost monopolistic situation). Thus, with the other partners mentioned above, the brand name Sealink was introduced for the consortium.<ref>Sealink title for BR and alliped shipping services ''[[Railway Gazette International|Railway Gazette]]'' 21 November 1969 page 843</ref>\n\nIn the late 1960s, as demand for international rail travel declined and the shipping business became almost exclusively dependent on passenger and freight vehicle traffic, the ferry business was [[incorporation (business)|incorporated]] as Sealink UK Limited on 1 January 1979,<ref name=company1402237>[http://data.companieshouse.gov.uk/doc/company/01402237 Companies House extract company no 1402237] Stena Line Limited formerly Stena Sealink Line Limited formerly Sealink Stena Line Limited formerly Sealink UK Limited</ref><ref>Sealink UK Limited formed ''[[The Railway Magazine]]'' issue 935 March 1979 page 111</ref> a wholly owned subsidiary of the [[British Railways Board]], but still part of the Sealink consortium.

Originally, there were to have been eight APT-P sets running, with minimal differences between them and the main fleet. However, financial constraints lead to only three being authorised, after two years of discussion by the British Railways Board. The cost was split equally between the Board and the [[Department for Transport|Ministry of Transport]]. After these delays, considerable pressure grew to put the APT-P into revenue-service before they were fully ready. This inevitably lead to high-profile failures as a result of technical problems.<ref name=\"APTP\"/>\n\nThese failures led to the trains being withdrawn from service while the problems were ironed out. However, by this time, managerial and political support had evaporated. Consequently, phase 3, the introduction of the Squadron fleet (APT-S), did not occur, and the project was ended in 1982.\n\nAlthough the APT never properly entered service, the experience gained enabled the construction of other [[High-speed rail|high-speed trains]]. The APT powercar technology was imported without the tilt into the design of the [[British Rail Class 91|Class 91]] locomotives, and the tilting technology was incorporated into [[Ferrovie dello Stato|Italian State Railway]]'s [[Pendolino]] trains, which first entered service in 1987.\n\n=== InterCity 125 ===\n{{Main|InterCity 125}}\n[[File:Intercity 125 original logo.svg|thumb|InterCity logo 1978\u20131985]]\n[[File:Intercity 125 2169045.jpg|thumb|left|An InterCity 125 about to depart [[Manchester Piccadilly railway station|Manchester Piccadilly]] in 1986]]\n\nThe '''InterCity 125''' (originally '''Inter-City 125''',<ref name=bbc1976>\"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/4/newsid_2486000/2486817.stm New train speeds into service]\".

Initially, an express blue (followed by [[Great Western Railway|GWR]]-style [[Brunswick green]] in 1952) was used on passenger locomotives, and [[London and North Western Railway|LNWR]]-style lined black for mixed-traffic locomotives, but later green was more widely adopted.<ref>Brian Haresnape ''Railway Liveries.

The Executive attempted to introduce a modern, curved logo which could also serve as the standard for station signage totems. Due to its similarity to a [[hot dog]], it became known as the \"flying sausage\". BR eventually adopted the common branding of the BTC as its first corporate logo, an [[Art Deco]]-style motif of a [[Lion (heraldry)|lion]] astride a spoked wheel, designed for the BTC by [[Cecil Thomas (sculptor)|Cecil Thomas]]; on the bar overlaid across the wheel, the BTC's name was replaced with the words \"British Railways\". This logo, nicknamed the \"Cycling Lion\", was applied from 1948 to 1956 to the sides of locomotives, while the sausage logo was adopted for station signs across Great Britain, each coloured according to the appropriate BR region.{{sfn|Jackson|2013}}\n\nIn 1956, the BTC was granted a [[Achievement (heraldry)|heraldic achievement]] by the [[College of Arms]] and the [[Lord Lyon]], and then BTC chairman [[Brian Robertson, 1st Baron Robertson of Oakridge|Brian Robertson]] wanted a grander logo for the railways. BR's second corporate logo (1956\u20131965), designed in consultation with [[Charles Franklyn]], adapted the original, depicting a rampant lion emerging from a [[Crown (heraldry)|heraldic crown]] and holding a spoked wheel, all enclosed in a roundel with the \"British Railways\" name displayed across a bar on either side. This emblem soon acquired the nickname of the \"Ferret and Dartboard\". A variant of the logo with the name in a circle was also used on locomotives.{{sfn|Jackson|2013}}\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Drewry No.2589, BR No.12589 (12748818505).jpg|The \"Cycling Lion\" logo on BR locomotive No.12589\nFile:Evening Star in Swindons STEAM museum ...

BR's design panel set up a working party led by [[Milner Gray (designer)|Milner Gray]] of the [[Design Research Unit]]. They drew up [[British Rail Corporate Identity Manual|a Corporate Identity Manual]] which established a coherent brand and design standard for the whole organisation, specifying [[Rail Blue]] and pearl grey as the standard colour scheme for all rolling stock; [[Rail Alphabet]] as the standard corporate typeface, designed by [[Jock Kinneir]] and [[Margaret Calvert]]; and introducing the now-iconic Corporate Identity Symbol of the \"Double Arrow\" logo. Designed by Gerald Barney (also of the DRU), this arrow device was formed of two interlocked arrows across two parallel lines, symbolising a double track railway. It was likened to a bolt of [[lightning]] or [[barbed wire]], and also acquired a nickname: \"the arrow of indecision\". A mirror image of the double arrow was used on the [[port side]] of BR-owned [[Sealink]] ferry funnels.  The new BR corporate identity and Double Arrow were rolled out in 1965, and the brand name of the organisation was truncated to \"British Rail\".{{sfn|Jackson|2013}}{{sfn|Height|Cresswell|1979}}\n\n=== Post-1960s ===\n\nThe uniformity of BR branding continued until the process of [[sectorisation]] was introduced in the 1980s. Certain BR operations such as [[InterCity (British Rail)|Inter-City]], [[Network SouthEast]], [[Regional Railways]] or [[Railfreight]] began to adopt their own identities, introducing logos and colour schemes which were essentially variants of the British Rail brand. Eventually, as sectorisation developed into a prelude to privatisation, the unified British Rail brand disappeared, with the notable exception of the Double Arrow symbol, which has survived to this day and serves as a [[generic trademark]] to denote railway services across Great Britain.{{sfn|Jackson|2013}} The BR Corporate Identity Manual is noted as a piece of British [[design history]] and there are plans for it to be re-published.<ref>{{cite news |title=Is the British Rail logo a design icon? |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-35144496 |work=BBC News |accessdate=20 December 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151220132046/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-35144496 |archivedate=20 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Finances ==\n\nDespite its nationalisation in 1947 \"as one of the 'commanding heights' of the economy\",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rail.co.uk/british-railway-history/british-railways/ |title=History of Railways in Britain |work=Rail.co.uk |accessdate=27 November 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151207124639/http://www.rail.co.uk/british-railway-history/british-railways/ |archive-date=7 December 2015 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> according to some sources British Rail was not profitable for most (if not all)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rail.co.uk/british-railway-history/ |title=History of the British Railway |work=Rail.co.uk |accessdate=27 November 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151128090614/http://www.rail.co.uk/british-railway-history/ |archive-date=28 November 2015 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> of its history.<ref>{{cite book |title=British Railways 1948\u201373: A Business History |first=T.

Although built as a working railway, in 1948 the line was principally a [[tourist attraction]]. British Rail operated the line using steam locomotives, long after the withdrawal of standard-gauge steam. The line's three steam locomotives were the only ones to receive [[TOPS]] serial numbers and be painted in BR Rail Blue livery with the double arrow logo. The Vale of Rheidol Railway was privatised in 1989 and continues to operate as a private heritage railway.\n\nOther preserved lines, or [[heritage railways]], have reopened  lines previously closed by British Rail.

Many ships were acquired on nationalisation, and others were built for operation by British Railways or its later subsidiary, [[Sealink]]. Those ships capable of carrying rail vehicles were classed under TOPS as [[British Rail Class 99|Class 99]].\n\n=== Sealink ===\n{{Main|Sealink}}\n[[File:Larne harbour (1984) - geograph.org.uk - 1158519.jpg|thumb|[[Sealink]] MV ''St David'' berthed in [[Larne]], [[Northern Ireland]]]]\nSealink was originally the brand name for the ferry services of British Rail in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Services to France, Belgium, and the Netherlands were run by Sealink UK as part of the Sealink consortium which also used ferries owned by French national railways ([[SNCF]]), the Belgian Maritime Transport Authority [[Regie voor Maritiem Transport]]/Regie des transports maritimes (RMT/RTM) and the Dutch [[Stoomvaart Maatschappij Zeeland]] (Zeeland Steamship Company).\n\nHistorically, the shipping services were exclusively an extension of the railways across the [[English Channel]] and the [[Irish Sea]] in order to provide through, integrated services to Europe and Ireland. As international travel became more popular in the late 1960s and before air travel became generally affordable, the responsibility for shipping services was taken away from the British Rail Regions and in 1969 centralised in a new division \u2013 British Rail Shipping and International Services Division.\n\nWith the advent of car ferry services, the old passenger-only ferries were gradually replaced by [[roll-on/roll-off]] ships, catering for motorists and rail passengers as well as road freight. However, given that there was now competition in the form of other ferry companies offering crossings to motorists, it became necessary to market the services in a normal business fashion (as opposed to the previous almost monopolistic situation). Thus, with the other partners mentioned above, the brand name Sealink was introduced for the consortium.<ref>Sealink title for BR and alliped shipping services ''[[Railway Gazette International|Railway Gazette]]'' 21 November 1969 page 843</ref>\n\nIn the late 1960s, as demand for international rail travel declined and the shipping business became almost exclusively dependent on passenger and freight vehicle traffic, the ferry business was [[incorporation (business)|incorporated]] as Sealink UK Limited on 1 January 1979,<ref name=company1402237>[http://data.companieshouse.gov.uk/doc/company/01402237 Companies House extract company no 1402237] Stena Line Limited formerly Stena Sealink Line Limited formerly Sealink Stena Line Limited formerly Sealink UK Limited</ref><ref>Sealink UK Limited formed ''[[The Railway Magazine]]'' issue 935 March 1979 page 111</ref> a wholly owned subsidiary of the [[British Railways Board]], but still part of the Sealink consortium.

Phase 1, the development of an experimental APT ([[British Rail APT-E|APT-E]]), was completed. This used a [[gas turbine-electric locomotive]], the only [[multiple unit]] so powered that was used by British Rail. It was formed of two [[power car]]s (numbers PC1 and PC2), initially with nothing between them and later, two trailer cars (TC1 and TC2).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.old-dalby.com/apt-e.htm |title=E Train |work=The Old Dalby Test Track |access-date=26 November 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829065627/http://www.old-dalby.com/apt-e.htm |archive-date=29 August 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref> The cars were made of aluminium to reduce the weight of the unit and were articulated.

The train drivers' union, [[Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen|ASLEF]], black-listed the train due to its use of a single driver.

This triggered a one-day strike by ASLEF that cost BR more than the research budget for the entire year.<ref name=\"APTP\">{{cite web |url=http://www.apt-p.com/APTWithHindsight.htm|title= APT \u2013 With Hindsight|accessdate=26 November 2006|author=Alan Wickens|work=Prototype Advanced Passenger Train (APT-P.com)}}</ref>\n\nPhase 2, the introduction of three prototype trains (APT-P) into revenue service on the [[Glasgow Central railway station|Glasgow]] \u2013 [[Euston railway station|London Euston]] route, did occur. Originally, there were to have been eight APT-P sets running, with minimal differences between them and the main fleet. However, financial constraints lead to only three being authorised, after two years of discussion by the British Railways Board. The cost was split equally between the Board and the [[Department for Transport|Ministry of Transport]]. After these delays, considerable pressure grew to put the APT-P into revenue-service before they were fully ready. This inevitably lead to high-profile failures as a result of technical problems.<ref name=\"APTP\"/>\n\nThese failures led to the trains being withdrawn from service while the problems were ironed out. However, by this time, managerial and political support had evaporated. Consequently, phase 3, the introduction of the Squadron fleet (APT-S), did not occur, and the project was ended in 1982.\n\nAlthough the APT never properly entered service, the experience gained enabled the construction of other [[High-speed rail|high-speed trains]]. The APT powercar technology was imported without the tilt into the design of the [[British Rail Class 91|Class 91]] locomotives, and the tilting technology was incorporated into [[Ferrovie dello Stato|Italian State Railway]]'s [[Pendolino]] trains, which first entered service in 1987.\n\n=== InterCity 125 ===\n{{Main|InterCity 125}}\n[[File:Intercity 125 original logo.svg|thumb|InterCity logo 1978\u20131985]]\n[[File:Intercity 125 2169045.jpg|thumb|left|An InterCity 125 about to depart [[Manchester Piccadilly railway station|Manchester Piccadilly]] in 1986]]\n\n\nThe '''InterCity 125''' (originally '''Inter-City 125''',<ref name=bbc1976>\"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/4/newsid_2486000/2486817.stm New train speeds into service]\".

The Telecomms infrastructure and [[British Rail Telecommunications]] was sold to [[Racal]], which in turn was sold to [[Global Crossing]] and merged with [[Thales Group]]. The rolling stock was transferred to three private [[rolling stock company|rolling stock companies]] (ROSCOs). Passenger services were divided into 25 operating companies, which were let on a franchise basis for a set period, whilst goods services were sold off completely.

{"title_page": "English exonyms", "text_new": "{{more citations needed|date=December 2013}}\nAn '''English exonym''' is a name in the [[English language]] for a place (a [[toponym]]), or occasionally other terms, which does not follow the local usage (the [[endonym]]). [[Exonyms and endonyms]] are features of all languages and other languages may have their own exonym for the English endonym, for example ''Llundain'' is the [[Welsh exonym]] for the English endonym \"London\".\n\nAn English exonym is typically a [[place name]] given by an English-speaking linguistic community to a topographic feature situated in a territory where English has no status. [[British English]] traditionally uses the term \"[[conventional name]]\", but the more internationally accepted term is \"exonym\".<ref>Manual for the National Standardization of Geographical Names - Page 129 United Nations Group of Experts on Geographical Names, United Nations. Statistical Division - 2006 \"An exonym is a name given by a linguistic community\u2014a group of people who communicate with each other with relative ease in a common language\u2014in its own language to a topographic feature situated in a territory where this language has no official status, for example, a foreign country. The English traditionally use the form \"[[conventional name]]\", but here we will use the internationally accepted term \u201cexonym\u201d.\"</ref>\n{{quotation|\"For a toponym to be defined as an exonym, there must exist a minimum degree of difference between it and the corresponding endonym. ... [[Chkalovsk, Russia|\u010ckalovsk]] is not an exonym of the Russian city \u0427\u043a\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a but simply the endonym written in a different script. The omission of diacritical marks usually does not turn an endonym into an exonym: Sao Paulo (for [[S\u00e3o Paulo]]); Malaga (for [[M\u00e1laga]]) or [[Amman]] (for 'Amm\u0101n) are not considered exonyms. However, in certain languages, diacritics enable names that are otherwise identical to be distinguished; in such cases, the omission of these diacritics could be regarded as generating exonyms. Thus, in Slovakia, [[Ve\u013ek\u00e9 Rovn\u00e9|Rovn\u00e9]] and [[Lednick\u00e9 Rovne|Rovne]] are different places, as are [[Nedo\u017eery-Brezany|Brezany]] and [[Bre\u017eany]]. This is the reason for the broad definition of the term \"exonym\" in the Glossary.\" \u2013 United Nations ''Manual for the National Standardization of Geographical Names'' 2006}}\n\nA less common form of exonym is usage for names and titles.

Sometimes the name ''Pukchos\u014fn (North Joseon)'' is used by South Koreans to distinguish North Korea from themselves, but North Koreans generally dislike being referred to as North Korea since they consider all Koreans as being citizens of the same divided country and since the North Korean government considers itself as being the sole legitimate government for the whole of Korea.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! colspan=\"3\" |{{Flag|North Korea}} ''Chos\u01d2n (\uc870\uc120)''\n|-\n!English name\n!North Korean place\n!Notes\n|-\n|''Diamond Mountain''\n|K\u01d4mgang san (\uae08\uac15\uc0b0)\n|English now uses rough translation [[Mount Kumgang]]\n|-\n|[[Tumen River]]\n|Duman gang (\ub450\ub9cc\uac15)\n|[[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] endonym\n|-\n|[[Yalu River]]\n|Amnok gang (\uc555\ub85d\uac15)\n|[[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] endonym\n|}\n\n=== North Macedonia ===\nDue to a naming dispute with Greece, the country changed its name from Macedonia to North Macedonia in 2019.\n\n=== Palestine ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! colspan=\"4\" |{{Flag|Palestine}} ''Filas\u1e6d\u012bn (\u0641\u0644\u0633\u0637\u064a\u0646\u200e)''\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |English name\n! colspan=\"2\" |Palestinian place\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Notes\n|-\n!Name\n!Language\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |[[Bethlehem]]\n|Beyt La\u1e25m\n|[[Levantine Arabic]]\n|\n|-\n|Bayta La\u1e25m (\u0628\u064a\u062a \u0644\u062d\u0645)\n|[[Modern Standard Arabic|Standard Arabic]]\n|\n|-\n|Bet Le\u1e25em (\u05d1\u05b5\u05bc\u05d9\u05ea \u05dc\u05b6\u05d7\u05b6\u05dd)\n|[[Modern Hebrew]]\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Hebron]]\n|Al-\u1e34al\u012bl (\u0627\u0644\u062e\u0644\u064a\u0644)\n|[[Modern Standard Arabic|Standard Arabic]]\n|\n|-\n|\u1e24evron (\u05d7\u05b6\u05d1\u05b0\u05e8\u05d5\u05b9\u05df)\n|[[Modern Hebrew]]\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Jericho]]\n|Ar\u012b\u1e25\u0101 (\u0623\u0631\u064a\u062d\u0627)\n|[[Modern Standard Arabic|Standard Arabic]]\n|\n|-\n|Yeri\u1e25o (\u05d9\u05b0\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u05d7\u05d5\u05b9 )\n|[[Modern Hebrew]]\n|\n|-\n|[[Jerusalem]]\n|Al-Quds (\u0627\u0644\u0642\u064f\u062f\u0633)\n|[[Modern Standard Arabic|Standard Arabic]]\n|\n|}\n\n===Poland===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! colspan=\"4\" |{{Flag|Poland}} ''Polska''\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |English name\n! colspan=\"2\" |Polish place\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Notes\n|-\n!Name\n!Language\n|-\n|''Auschwitz''\n|[[O\u015bwi\u0119cim]]\n|[[Polish language|Polish]]\n|Dated, [[German language|German]] name\n|-\n|[[Carpathian Mountains]]\n|Karpaty\n|[[Polish language|Polish]]\n|\n|-\n|''Cracow''\n|[[Krak\u00f3w]]\n|[[Polish language|Polish]]\n|Obsolete\n|-\n|''Danzig''\n|[[Gda\u0144sk]]\n|[[Polish language|Polish]]\n|Dated, [[German language|German]] name\n|-\n|[[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]\n|Galicja\n|[[Polish language|Polish]]\n|\n|-\n|''Giant Mountains''\n|[[Krkono\u0161e|Karkonosze]]\n|[[Polish language|Polish]]\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Kashubia]]\n|Kasz\u00ebb\u00eb\n|[[Kashubians|Kashubian]]\n|\n|-\n|Kaszuby\n|[[Polish language|Polish]]\n|\n|-\n|[[Kuyavia]]\n|Kujawy\n|[[Polish language|Polish]]\n|\n|-\n|[[Mazovia]]\n|Mazowsze\n|[[Polish language|Polish]]\n|\n|-\n|[[Masuria|Mazuria]]\n|Mazury\n|[[Polish language|Polish]]\n|\n|-\n|[[Oder]] river\n|Odra\n|[[Polish language|Polish]]\n|\n|-\n|[[Pomerania]]\n|Pomorze\n|[[Polish language|Polish]]\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Silesia]]\n|\u015al\u0105sk\n|[[Polish language|Polish]]\n|\n|-\n|\u015al\u014dnsk\n|[[Silesian language|Silesian]]\n|\n|-\n|[[Vistula]] river\n|Wis\u0142a\n|[[Polish language|Polish]]\n|\n|-\n|[[Warsaw]]\n|Warszawa\n|[[Polish language|Polish]]\n|\n|}\n\n===Portugal===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! colspan=\"3\" |{{Flag|Portugal}}\n|-\n!English name\n!Portuguese place\n!Notes\n|-\n|[[Azores]]\n|A\u00e7ores\n|[[Spanish language|Spanish]] name\n|-\n|''Braganza''\n|[[Bragan\u00e7a, Portugal|Bragan\u00e7a]]\n|Dated, [[Spanish language|Spanish]] name\n|-\n|[[Lisbon]]\n|Lisboa\n|\n|-\n|''Oporto''\n|[[Porto]]\n|Obsolete\n|-\n|[[Tagus]] river\n|Tejo\n|[[Latin]] name\n|}\n\n===Romania===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! colspan=\"3\" |{{Flag|Romania}} ''Rom\u00e2nia''\n|-\n!English name\n!Romanian place\n!Notes\n|-\n|[[Bucharest]]\n|Bucure\u0219ti\n|\n|-\n|[[Carpathian Mountains]]\n|Carpa\u021bi\n|\n|-\n|[[Danube]] river\n|Dun\u01cerea\n|\n|-\n|''Jassy''\n|[[Ia\u0219i]]<ref>Robert D.

[[Exonyms and endonyms]] are features of all languages and other languages may have their own exonym for the English endonym, for example ''Llundain'' is the [[Welsh exonym]] for the English endonym \"London\".\n\nAn English exonym is typically a [[place name]] given by an English-speaking linguistic community to a topographic feature situated in a territory where English has no status. [[British English]] traditionally uses the term \"[[conventional name]]\", but the more internationally accepted term is \"exonym\".<ref>Manual for the National Standardization of Geographical Names - Page 129 United Nations Group of Experts on Geographical Names, United Nations. Statistical Division - 2006 \"An exonym is a name given by a linguistic community\u2014a group of people who communicate with each other with relative ease in a common language\u2014in its own language to a topographic feature situated in a territory where this language has no official status, for example, a foreign country. The English traditionally use the form \"[[conventional name]]\", but here we will use the internationally accepted term \u201cexonym\u201d.\"</ref>\n{{quotation|\"For a toponym to be defined as an exonym, there must exist a minimum degree of difference between it and the corresponding endonym. ... [[Chkalovsk, Russia|\u010ckalovsk]] is not an exonym of the Russian city \u0427\u043a\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a but simply the endonym written in a different script. The omission of diacritical marks usually does not turn an endonym into an exonym: Sao Paulo (for [[S\u00e3o Paulo]]); Malaga (for [[M\u00e1laga]]) or [[Amman]] (for 'Amm\u0101n) are not considered exonyms. However, in certain languages, diacritics enable names that are otherwise identical to be distinguished; in such cases, the omission of these diacritics could be regarded as generating exonyms. Thus, in Slovakia, [[Ve\u013ek\u00e9 Rovn\u00e9|Rovn\u00e9]] and [[Lednick\u00e9 Rovne|Rovne]] are different places, as are [[Nedo\u017eery-Brezany|Brezany]] and [[Bre\u017eany]]. This is the reason for the broad definition of the term \"exonym\" in the Glossary.\" \u2013 United Nations ''Manual for the National Standardization of Geographical Names'' 2006}}\n\nA less common form of exonym is usage for names and titles. [[list of English translated personal names|Personal exonyms]] are typically limited to [[regnal name]]s such as popes ([[John Paul II]]) and monarchs ([[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]); less commonly very well known non-modern authors ([[John Calvin]], for French ''Jean Calvin'') are referred to by exonyms.\n\n[[Romanization]], or [[transcription (linguistics)|transcription]] of a non-Latin alphabet endonym into a Latin alphabet, is not generally regarded as creating exonyms; ''\"The application of any scientifically sound romanization system to a non-Roman endonym merely re-creates that original endonym in another legitimate form\"'' (P\u00e4ll, 2002).<ref>Peeter P\u00e4ll, Estonia, \"Do Romanization Systems Create Exonyms?\" UN Group of Experts on Geographical Names, Working Group on Romanization Systems (2002)</ref><ref>Exonyms and the International Standardisation of Geographical Names Peter Jordan, Milan Oro\u017een Adami\u010d, Paul Woodman - 2007- Page 16 \"2.2.11 This brings us on to the question of romanization. Does the application of a romanization system turn an endonym into an exonym? In his GeoNames 2000 paper Do Romanization Systems Create Exonyms?, Peeter P\u00e4ll argued convincingly..\"</ref> However old romanization systems may leave a legacy of \"familiar\" spellings, as in the case of, for example, [[romanization of Burmese]].<ref>M. B. Hooker ''Laws of South-East Asia: The pre-modern texts 1986 - Page 23 \"Place names such as Rangoon, Mandalay, Pegu and Moulmein have been left in the English form which is familiar to the non-Burmese reader.

The list includes countries with limited recognition, autonomous territories of sovereign countries, and fully sovereign countries.\n\nCountry names are listed in their short form, and do not include names spelled identically in English. Near-identical names in pronunciation or spelling are included, but countries named with non-proper nouns (like [[Central African Republic]] or [[United Arab Emirates]]) are not.\n\nThe languages listed are official languages and/ or prominent local languages, except if the name for the associated country is spelled the same as in English.

{"title_page": "Koi-Koi", "text_new": "{{multiple issues|\n{{one source|date=January 2015}}\n{{citations|date=January 2015}}\n}}\n{{Italic title|reason=[[:Category:Japanese words and phrases]]}}\n[[Image:Koi-Koi Setup.jpg|thumb|The game in its initial set-up.]]\n\n{{nihongo|'''''Koi-Koi'''''|\u3053\u3044\u3053\u3044|lead=yes}} is a popular card game in Japan played with [[Hanafuda]] cards. The phrase \"koi-koi\" means \"come on\" in Japanese which is said when the player wants to continue the hand.  \n\nThe object of the game is to form special card combinations called \"yaku\" from cards accumulated in a point pile. Players can gain cards in their point piles by matching cards in their hands, or drawn from the draw pile, with cards on the table. Once a yaku has been made, a player can stop to cash in points, or keep going (referred to as \"koi-koi\", hence the name of the game) to form additional yaku for more points. The point values assigned to individual cards have no effect on the score, but they are helpful to judge their value in forming yaku.\n\n==Deal==\nAn initial dealer (called the \"oya\", or \"parent\"), is decided upon when the game starts. This can be done with any method ([[rock-paper-scissors]], dice roll) the players agree upon. A hanafuda-specific method involves random card draw: each player draws a single card; the player who draws a card from the earliest month is the oya. If both players draw a card from the same month, the player with the higher value card becomes the oya.\n\nTo deal, the oya deals eight cards to their opponent (face down),then to the table (face up), and then to themselves (face down), though this is normally done with two or four cards at a time. The rest of the cards are set aside as a draw pile, and then the game begins starting with the oya.\n\n==Play==\nOn a player's turn, they may match by suit (such as month or flower) any one card in their hand with one on the table and take both into their point pile. If they cannot match a card from their hand, they must discard a card face up to the table. After matching or discarding a card, they then draw one card from the draw pile and place it face up on the playing area. If this card matches any card now on the table, they must match that card and take both for their point pile; otherwise, it becomes part of the table. In the event that the drawn card matches more than one card on the table, the player gets the choice as to which card to match and therefore keep in addition to the drawn card.\n\nAfter a player's turn ends, if they made at least one yaku that turn, that player must then make a choice. They may end the hand and add the value of their yaku to their point total, or they can choose to continue playing (calling \"koi-koi\") in an effort to gain more points. In some versions, a player may only call koi-koi once per hand; in others, a player may call koi-koi on multiple yaku-forming turns. Calling koi-koi leaves the player vulnerable, as if their opponent is able to form a yaku before the caller forms another, the opponent gains double their score and the caller earns nothing. If a player has yaku totaling 7 or more points when the hand ends, that player earns twice that value. If a player hits 7 or more points ''and'' their opponent had called koi-koi, he gets both doubling bonuses for a total of four times their score.\n\nThe player with the most points at the end of the hand becomes the new oya, and a new hand is dealt. Should both players ever run out of cards to play without having formed a yaku on the last play, no points are awarded to either player, and the next hand begins with the same oya. Generally, play continues for 12 hands, but the players can decide to play for a different number of rounds before the game starts.\n\nSome groups, when gambling, will require the player whose score was multiplied to pay a proportionately larger amount of the winnings (i.e. a player who continued play twice would pay twice as much as the other player, since their score would have been doubled).\n\n===Special cards===\n\nThe Sake Cup is unique in that, though technically classified as a 10-point card, it counts as both a 10-point card and a 1-point card at the same time. Some rules allow the Sake Cup to count as a 10-point card and two 1-point cards at the same time.\n\nAdditionally, November's 1-point card, the Lightning, is sometimes used as a [[Wild card (poker)|wild card]] that can match any card in some games.\n\n===Yaku listing===\nIf certain combinations of cards are won during play, extra points apply.  Sometimes, players will be paired across the table when this rule is used (in multi-player Koi-Koi) to increase the chance of getting combos.  Below is a list of special combinations with example point values. Different rulesets give different point values and some do not include the ''tsukimi-zake'' and ''hanami-zake'' yaku.\n\nSome yaku can be considered extensions of others. For example, one may qualify for both Akatan and Tanzaku by having the Akatan combination as well as two additional five-point cards. In these cases, players are awarded points for both Akatan and Tanzaku (unless players decide only the single highest-scoring yaku counts).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! width=\"10%\" | Points\n! width=\"30%\" | Combo Name\n! width=\"60%\" | Card Combo\n|-\n| 6\n| ''Sank\u014d'' ({{lang|ja|\u4e09\u5149}}) \"three brights\"\n| Any three 20-point cards excluding the Rainman (Willow's 20-point card).\n|-\n| 8\n| ''Shik\u014d'' ({{lang|ja|\u56db\u5149}}) \"four brights\"\n| The four 20-point cards which exclude the Rainman (Willow's 20-point card).\n|-\n| 7\n| ''Ame-Shik\u014d'' ({{lang|ja|\u96e8\u56db\u5149}}) \"rain four brights\"\n| Any four 20-point cards including the [[Ono no Michikaze|Rainman]] (Willow's 20-point card).\n|-\n| 15\n| ''Gok\u014d'' ({{lang|ja|\u4e94\u5149}}) \"five brights\"\n| All five 20-point cards.\n|-\n| 5\n| ''Inoshikach\u014d'' ({{lang|ja|\u732a\u9e7f\u8776}}) \"boar deer butterfly\"\n| The Boar, the Deer, and the Butterfly (the 10-point cards from Clover, Maple, and Peony, respectively).
