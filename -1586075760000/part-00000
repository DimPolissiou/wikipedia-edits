In 1926 he became Brigadier General at age 33, the youngest General in all Europe,<ref>Television documentary from CC&C Ideacom Production, ''Apocalypse Never-Ending War 1918\u20131926'', part 2, aired at Danish DR K at 22.October 2018</ref> and two years later he became director of the [[General Military Academy]] in Zaragoza.{{sfn|Preston|1994|p=25}} \n\nAs a [[Conservatism|conservative]] and a [[Monarchism|monarchist]], Franco regretted the abolition of the [[Restoration (Spain)|monarchy]] and the establishment of the [[Second Spanish Republic|Second Republic]] in 1931. He was devastated by the closing of his beloved Academy, but nevertheless continued his service in the [[Spanish Republican Army|Republican Army]]. For a time he was even left without posting, but his career improved after the right-wing [[Confederaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola de Derechas Aut\u00f3nomas|CEDA]] and [[Radical Republican Party|PRR]] won the [[1933 Spanish general election|1933 election]]. In 1934 Franco led the brutal suppression of the [[Asturian miners' strike of 1934|uprising]] in [[Asturias]], sharpening the antagonism between [[Left-wing politics|Left]] and [[Right-wing politics|Right]] in the country. In 1935 he became [[Chief of Staff of the Army (Spain)|Chief of Army Staff]], but when the leftist [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]] won the [[1936 Spanish general election|1936 election]] Franco was once again marginalized, being relieved of his position and relegated to the [[Canary Islands]]. When [[Jos\u00e9 Calvo Sotelo|Calvo Sotelo]], leader of the opposition, was murdered that summer it triggered [[Spanish coup of July 1936|a military coup]] which had been plotted since the election in February. Franco had initially kept his distance from the plot, but joined in the last minute with complete resolution. The coup failed and precipitated the [[Spanish Civil War]]. \n\nFranco took control of the [[Army of Africa (Spain)|Army of Africa]], which was air-lifted to Spain. With the death of the other leading generals, Franco became [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|his faction's]] only leader and was appointed [[Generalissimo]] and [[List of heads of state of Spain#Francoist Spain (1936\u20131975)|Head of State]] in the autumn of 1936. By a [[Unification Decree (Spain, 1937)|Unification Decree]] in 1937 Franco merged all [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist parties]] into a [[one-party state|single party]], the [[FET y de las JONS]]. In 1939 the Nationalists had won the war, which had claimed almost half a million lives. The victory extended [[Francoist Spain|Franco's dictatorship]] over all of Spain, and it was followed by a period of [[White Terror (Spain)#Postwar|repression of political opponents and dissenters]].

He nurtured a [[cult of personality]] and the ''[[Movimiento Nacional]]'' became the only channel of participation in Spanish public life.

After the war, Spain was shunned and [[Pariah state|isolated]] by many other countries for nearly a decade. \n\nBy the 1950s the nature of Franco's regime changed from being openly [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] and severely repressive to an authoritarian system with limited [[Pluralism (political theory)|pluralism]].<ref>[[#Payne2000|Payne (2000)]], p. 645</ref> During the [[Cold War]] Franco became one of the world's foremost anti-Communist figures and his regime was assisted by [[First World|the West]], particularly the [[United States]].<ref name=\"Rubottom, R 1984\"/> Spain had suffered chronic economic depression in the late 1940s and early 1950s, but by abandoning [[autarky]] and pursuing economic liberalization Franco presided over the \"[[Spanish miracle]]\".

The introduction of the [[Organic Law of the State|Organic Law in 1966]] limited and clearly defined Franco's powers and officially created the office of [[Prime Minister of Spain|Prime Minister]]. In 1973, beset with old age, sickness, and wishing to partially relinquish the burden of governing Spain, Franco resigned as Prime Minister and was succeeded by Carrero Blanco. However, Franco remained as Head of State and Commander-in-Chief. Franco died in 1975 at the age of 82 and was buried in the [[Valle de los Ca\u00eddos]]. Through the power to appoint a king, granted to him by the 1947 [[Law of Succession to the Headship of the State]], he restored the monarchy before his death, appointing [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos]] as his successor and [[Monarchy of Spain|King of Spain]]. Juan Carlos led the [[Spanish transition to democracy]].\n\nFranco remains a controversial figure in Spanish history and the nature of his dictatorship changed over time. His reign was marked by both brutal repression, with thousands killed, and economic prosperity, which greatly improved the quality of life in Spain. His dictatorial style proved very adaptable, which could introduce social and economic reform, and the only consistent points in Franco's long rule were above all [[authoritarianism]], [[Spanish nationalism]], [[National Catholicism]], [[Anti-Masonry|anti-Freemasonry]], and [[anti-Communism]].\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:Padres-de-Franco.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.65|His parents with Francisco in arms, on the day of his baptism on 17 December 1892]]\nFranco was born at 12:30 on 4 December 1892 in the Calle Frutos Saavedra in [[Ferrol, Spain|El Ferrol]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]].<ref name=\"Preston, p. 1\">[[#Preston|Preston]], p. 1</ref> He was baptised thirteen days later at the military church of San Francisco, with the baptismal name Francisco Paulino Hermenegildo Te\u00f3dulo;<ref name=\"Preston, p. 1\"/> Francisco for his paternal grandfather, Paulino for his godfather, Hermenegildo for his maternal grandmother and godmother, and Te\u00f3dulo for the [[Calendar of saints|saint day]] of his birth.\n\nFranco was born into a seafaring family.

May, ''Francisco Franco: The Jewish Connection'' is somewhat fanciful\".<ref name=\"ancest\"/> Furthermore, \"a significant portion of the Spanish and Portuguese populations have some remote Jewish ancestry; if this were true of Franco he would simply be in the position of millions of other Spaniards.\"<ref name=\"ancest\">[[#Payne2000|Payne (2000)]], p. 68</ref>}} After relocating to [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], the family was strongly involved in the [[Spanish Navy]], and over the span of two centuries produced naval officers for six uninterrupted generations, down to Franco's father Nicol\u00e1s Franco y Salgado Ara\u00fajo (22 November 1855 \u2013 22 February 1942).\n\nHis mother was Mar\u00eda del Pilar Bahamonde y Pardo de Andrade (15 October 1865 \u2013 28 February 1934) from an upper middle-class [[Roman Catholic]] family. Her father, Landislao Bahamonde Ortega, was the commissar of naval equipment at the Port. Franco's parents married in 1890 in the Church of San Francisco in el Ferrol.<ref>[[#Preston|Preston]], p. 3</ref> The young Franco spent much of his childhood with his two brothers, [[Nicol\u00e1s Franco (politician)|Nicol\u00e1s]] (Ferrol, 1891\u20131977) and [[Ram\u00f3n Franco|Ram\u00f3n]], and his two sisters, Mar\u00eda del Pilar (Ferrol, 1894 \u2013 Madrid, 1989), and Mar\u00eda de la Paz (Ferrol, 1899 \u2013 Ferrol, 1903). The latter died in infancy. His brother Nicol\u00e1s was later a [[Spanish Navy|naval]] [[officer (armed forces)|officer]] and diplomat who in time married Mar\u00eda Isabel Pascual del Pobil y Ravello, and was seen as intelligent, the best student of all the siblings and also the most conventional of the brothers.{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|p=8}} Ram\u00f3n was an internationally renown pioneer [[aviator]], a [[Freemason]] with originally [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] political leanings and was generally the most audacious and rebellious brother, both socially and politically. He was also the second sibling to die, killed in an air accident on a military mission in 1938.{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|pp=8-9}} Mar\u00eda del Pilar was known for being lively and highly social; she married Alonso Jar\u00e1iz y Jer\u00e9z and had ten children, five after she was 45 years old; several of her sons would go on to have careers in the military, while two of her daughters would marry officers.{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|p=7}}\n\nFranco's father was an officer of the naval supply system who reached the rank of ''Intendente General'' (equivalent to Vice Admiral). He was an unconventional man, a well read free-thinker, agnostic and somewhat of a libertine. Franco's mother, by contrast, was loving, pious and self-sacrificing, obedient to her husband and never speaking ill of him despite suffering at his hand. When Franco was fourteen, his father moved away to Madrid after receiving a reassignment there and he would ultimately abandon his family, marrying another woman. While Franco did not suffer any great abuse at his father's hand, he would never overcome his antipathy for his father and largely ignored him for the rest of his life; years after becoming dictator, Franco wrote a brief novel ''Raza'' under the pseudonym Jaime de Andrade, whose protagonist is believed by Stanley Payne to represent the idealised man Franco wished his father had been. Conversely, Franco strongly identified with his mother (who always wore widow's black once she realised her husband had abandoned her) and learned from her moderation, austerity, self-control, family solidarity and respect for Catholicism, though he would also inherit his father's harshness, coldness and implacability.{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|pp=5-8}}\n\n== Military career ==\n=== Rif War and advancement through the ranks ===\nFrancisco was to follow his father into the Navy, but as a result of the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] the country lost much of its navy as well as most of its colonies. Not needing any more officers, the Naval Academy admitted no new entrants from 1906 to 1913. To his father's chagrin, Francisco decided to try the [[Spanish Army]]. In 1907, he entered the Infantry Academy in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]. At the age of fourteen, Franco was one of the youngest members of his class, with most boys being between sixteen and eighteen. He was quite short and was bullied for his small size. His grades were average, though his good memory meant he seldom struggled in mental tests but his small stature was a hindrance in physical tests. He would graduate in July 1910 as second lieutenant, coming 251 out of 312, though this may have been less to do with his grades than his small size, young age and reduced physical presence; Stanley Payne observes that by the time Civil War began, Franco had already become a major general and would soon be a generalissimo, while none of his higher-ranking fellow cadets had managed to get beyond the rank of lieutenant-colonel.{{Sfn|Jensen|2005|pp=13\u201314}}{{Sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|pp=12\u201315}} At 19, Franco was promoted to the rank of first lieutenant in June 1912.{{Sfn|Jensen|2005|p=28}}<ref>{{Cite book|title=Franco : a concise biography|last=Ashford.|first=Hodges, Gabrielle|date=2002|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-0312282851|edition=1st U.S.|location=New York|oclc=49386039|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/francoconcisebio0000hodg}}</ref> Two years later, he obtained a commission to Morocco. Spanish efforts to occupy their new African [[protectorate]] provoked the [[Second Melillan campaign]] in 1909 with native Moroccans, the first of a period of [[Riffians|Riffian]] rebellions. Their tactics resulted in heavy losses among Spanish [[officer (armed forces)|military officers]], and also provided an opportunity to earn promotion through merit. It was said that officers would receive either ''la caja o la faja'' (a coffin or a general's sash). Franco quickly gained a reputation as a good officer. [[File:Francisco y Ram\u00f3n Franco 1925.jpg|thumb|left|Francisco and his brother Ram\u00f3n in [[Spanish protectorate in Morocco|North Africa]], 1925]] In 1913, Franco transferred into the newly formed [[regulares]]: Moroccan colonial troops with Spanish officers, who acted as [[shock troops]]. This transfer into a perilous role may have been decided because Franco failed to win the hand of his first love, [[Sof\u00eda Subir\u00e1n]]. (The letters between the two were found and she was questioned by journalists.)\n\nIn 1916, aged 23 and already a captain, he was shot by enemy machine gun fire. He was badly wounded in the abdomen, specifically the liver, in a skirmish at ''El Biutz''. The physicians of the battle later concluded that his intestines were spared because he inhaled the moment he was shot. In 2008, it was alleged by historian Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Zavala that this injury had left Franco with only [[monorchism|one tesitcle]]. Zavala cites Ana Puigvert, whose father Antonio Puigvert, was Franco's physician.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/mundo/cultura_sociedad/2009/05/090518_1559_franco_lp |title=Franco, \"hombre de un s\u00f3lo test\u00edculo\" BBC News Mundo| access-date=27 January 2020}}</ref>.\n\nAt that time, abdominal wounds in Africa were normally fatal. His improbable survival marked him permanently in the eyes of the native troops as a man blessed with ''[[Barakah|baraka]]'' (in Islam, the beneficent force from God ). He was recommended for promotion to major and to receive Spain's highest honour for gallantry, the coveted ''[[Laureate Cross of Saint Ferdinand|Cruz Laureada de San Fernando]]''. Both proposals were denied citing the twenty three years old Franco's young age as the reason for denial. Instead received the prestigious ''Cross of Maria Cristina, First Class''.<ref>[[#Preston|Preston]]</ref>\n\nWith that he was promoted to major at the end of February 1917 at age 24. This made him the youngest major in the Spanish army. From 1917 to 1920, he served in Spain. In 1920, Lieutenant Colonel [[Jos\u00e9 Mill\u00e1n Astray]], a [[wikt:histrionic|histrionic]] but charismatic officer, founded the [[Spanish Foreign Legion]], on similar lines to the [[French Foreign Legion]]. Franco became the Legion's second-in-command and returned to Africa. In the [[Rif War]], on 24 July 1921, the poorly commanded and overextended Spanish Army suffered [[Battle of Annual|a crushing defeat]] at [[Annual (Morocco)|Annual]] from the [[The Republic of the Rif|Republic of the Rif]] led by the [[Muhammad Ibn 'Abd al-Karim al-Khattabi|Abd el-Krim]] brothers. The Legion and supporting units relieved the Spanish enclave of [[Melilla]] after a three-day forced march led by Franco. In 1923, by now a [[lieutenant colonel]], he was made commander of the Legion.\n\nOn 22 October 1923, Franco married [[Carmen Polo|Mar\u00eda del Carmen Polo y Mart\u00ednez-Vald\u00e8s]] (11 June 1900 \u2013 6 February 1988).<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://sites.jmu.edu/spanishcivilwar/carmenpolo/ | title=Carmen Polo: La Esposa de Francisco Franco \u2013 la Guerra Civil Espa\u00f1ola | access-date=30 December 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171231051755/https://sites.jmu.edu/spanishcivilwar/carmenpolo/ | archive-date=31 December 2017 | url-status=dead }}</ref> Three years later on 14 September 1926, the couple had a daughter, [[Carmen Franco y Polo|Mar\u00eda del Carmen]].

Promoted to [[colonel]], Franco led the first wave of troops ashore at [[Al Hoceima]] ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Alhucemas'') in 1925. This landing in the heartland of Abd el-Krim's tribe, combined with the French invasion from the south, spelled the beginning of the end for the short-lived [[Republic of the Rif]]. Franco's recognition eventually caught up with him and he was promoted to brigadier general on 3 February 1926. This made him the youngest general in Spain, and perhaps, along with [[Major-General]] [[Joseph Sweeney (Irish politician)|Joe Sweeney]] of the [[Irish Army]], one of the youngest generals in Europe. In 1928 Franco was appointed director of the newly created General Military Academy of Zaragoza, a new college for all army [[cadet]]s, replacing the former separate institutions for young men seeking to become officers in infantry, cavalry, artillery, and other branches of the army. Franco was removed as Director of the Zaragoza Military Academy in 1931; about 95% of his former Zaragoza cadets later came to side with him in the Civil War.\n\n=== During the Second Spanish Republic ===\nThe municipal elections of April 12, 1931 were largely seen as plebiscite on the monarchy. The Republican-Socialist alliance failed to win the majority of the municipality cities in Spain but had a landslide victory in all large cities and in almost all provincial capitals.{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|p=66}} The monarchists and the army deserted Alfonso XIII and the King decided to leave the country into exile, giving way to the [[Second Spanish Republic]]. Although Franco believed that the majority of the Spanish people still supported the crown, and although he regretted the end of the monarchy, he did not object, nor did he challenge the legitimacy of the republic.{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|p=68}} But the closing of the Academy in June by War Minister [[Manuel Aza\u00f1a]] was a major setback for Franco and provoked his first clash with the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republic]].

The conspiracy suggested that Jews, Freemasons, Communists, and other leftists alike sought the destruction of Christian Europe, with Spain the principal target.<ref>Preston, Paul (2010) \"The Theorists of Extermination\", essay in ''Unearthing Franco's Legacy'', pp. 42, 45.

Franco avoided involvement in [[Jos\u00e9 Sanjurjo]]'s attempted coup that year, and even wrote a hostile letter to Sanjurjo expressing his anger over the attempt. As a result of Aza\u00f1a's military reform, in January 1933 Franco was relegated from first to 24th in the list of brigadiers. The same year, on 17 February he was given the military command of the [[Balearic Islands]]. The post was above his rank, but Franco was still angered that he was purposely stuck in positions he disliked. It was quite common for conservative officers to be moved or demoted, however.\n\nThe elections held in October 1933 resulted in a centre-right majority. The political party with the most votes was the Confederaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ol de Derechas Aut\u00f3nomas (\"CEDA\"), but president [[Niceto Alcal\u00e1-Zamora|Alcal\u00e1-Zamora]] declined to invite the leader of the CEDA, Gil Robles, to form a government. Instead he invited the [[Radical Republican Party]]'s [[Alejandro Lerroux]] to do so. Despite receiving the most votes, CEDA was denied cabinet positions for nearly a year.{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|pp=84-85}} After a year of intense pressure, CEDA, the largest party in the congress, was finally successful in forcing the acceptance of three ministries. However the entrance of CEDA in the government, despite being normal in a parliamentary democracy, was not well accepted by the left.  The Socialists triggered an insurrection that they had been preparing for nine months.{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|p=88}} A general strike was called by the UGT and the PSOE in the name of the ''Alianza Obrera''.

After various postponements, 18 July was fixed as the date of the uprising.

Despite the [[Non-Intervention Agreement]] of August 1936, the war was marked by [[Foreign involvement in the Spanish Civil War|foreign intervention]] on behalf of both sides, leading to international repercussions. The nationalist side was supported by [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]], which sent the ''[[Corpo Truppe Volontarie]]'', and later by [[Nazi Germany]], which assisted with the [[Condor Legion]]. They were opposed by the [[Soviet Union]] and communists, socialists and anarchists within Spain. The [[United Kingdom]] and [[French Third Republic|France]] strictly adhered to the arms embargo,{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} provoking dissensions within the [[Popular Front (France)|French Popular Front]] coalition which was led by [[L\u00e9on Blum]], but the Republican side was nonetheless supported by the Soviet Union and volunteers who fought in the [[International Brigades]] (see for example [[Ken Loach]]'s ''[[Land and Freedom]]'').\n\nBecause [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Joseph Stalin]] used the war as a testing ground for modern warfare, some historians, such as [[Ernst Nolte]], have considered the Spanish Civil War, along with World War II, to be part of a [[European Civil War]] which lasted from 1936 to 1945 and was mainly characterised as a [[left-wing politics|left]]/[[right-wing politics|right]] ideological conflict. This interpretation has not been accepted by most historians, who consider the Spanish Civil War and the Second World War to be two distinct conflicts. Among other things, they point to the political heterogeneity on both sides (''See [[Spanish Civil War#Other factions|Spanish Civil War: other factions]]'') and criticise a monolithic interpretation, which overlooks the local nuances of [[History of Spain|Spanish history]].\n\n=== The first months ===\nFollowing 18 July 1936 ''[[pronunciamiento]]'', Franco assumed the leadership of the 30,000 soldiers of the [[Spanish Army of Africa]]. The first days of the insurgency were marked with a serious need to secure control over the [[Spanish Morocco|Spanish Moroccan Protectorate]]. On one side, Franco had to win the support of the natives and their (nominal) authorities, and, on the other, had to ensure his control over the army. His method was the summary execution of some 200 senior officers loyal to the Republic (one of them his own cousin). His loyal bodyguard was shot by Manuel Blanco.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.memoriahistocheeserica.org/alojados/periquete/paginas/noticias1.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170129081724/http://memoriahistocheeserica.org/alojados/periquete/paginas/noticias1.html | url-status = dead | archive-date = 29 January 2017 | title = La Memoria de los Nuestros | language = Spanish | accessdate = 21 July 2006}}</ref> Franco's first problem was how to move his troops to the [[Iberian Peninsula]], since most units of the Navy had remained in control of the Republic and were blocking the [[Strait of Gibraltar]]. He requested help from [[Benito Mussolini]], who responded with an unconditional offer of arms and planes; in Germany [[Wilhelm Canaris]], the head of the ''[[Abwehr]]'' military intelligence, persuaded Hitler to support the Nationalists. From 20 July onward Franco was able, with a small group of 22 mainly German [[Junkers Ju 52]] aircraft, to initiate an [[Airbridge (logistics)|air bridge]] to [[Seville]], where his troops helped to ensure the rebel control of the city. Through representatives, he started to negotiate with the United Kingdom, Germany, and Italy for more military support, and above all for more aircraft. Negotiations were successful with the last two on 25 July and aircraft began to arrive in [[Tetouan]] on 2 August. On 5 August Franco was able to break the blockade with the newly arrived air support, successfully deploying a ship convoy with some 2,000 soldiers.\n\nIn early August, the situation in western [[Andalusia]] was stable enough to allow him to organise a column (some 15,000 men at its height), under the command of then Lieutenant-Colonel [[Juan Yag\u00fce]], which would march through [[Extremadura]] towards Madrid. On 11 August [[Battle of M\u00e9rida|M\u00e9rida was taken]], and on 15 August [[Battle of Badajoz (1936)|Badajoz]], thus joining both nationalist-controlled areas. Additionally, Mussolini ordered a voluntary army, the ''[[Corpo Truppe Volontarie]]'' (CTV) of some 12,000 Italians of fully motorised units to Seville and Hitler added to them a professional squadron from the [[Luftwaffe]] (2JG/88) with about 24 planes. All these planes had the Nationalist Spanish insignia painted on them, but were flown by Italian and German nationals. The backbone of Franco's aviation in those days were the Italian [[SM.79]] and [[SM.81]] bombers, the biplane Fiat [[CR.32]] fighter and the German [[Junkers Ju 52]] cargo-bomber and the [[Heinkel He 51]] biplane fighter.\n\nOn 21 September, with the head of the column at the town of [[Maqueda]] (some 80&nbsp;km away from Madrid), Franco ordered a detour to free the [[Siege of the Alc\u00e1zar|besieged garrison at the Alc\u00e1zar]] of [[Toledo (Spain)|Toledo]], which was achieved on 27 September. This controversial decision gave the [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]] time to strengthen its defenses in Madrid and hold the city that year, but with Soviet support.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Maxim Litvinov: A Biography|last=Holroyd-Doveton|first=John|publisher=Woodland Publications|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=380}}</ref> Kennan alleges that, once Stalin had decided to assist the Spanish Republicans, the operation was put in place with remarkable speed and energy. The first load of arms and tanks arrives as early as 26 September and was secretly unloaded at night. Advisers accompanied the armaments.

A more likely motive was Stalin's instinct for self-preservation, because the Spanish Civil War had aroused a spirit of heroism in support of freedom more in line with Trotskyism and such ideas might be exported to the Soviet Union. Further proof of this is what Modin stated that Stalin decided to attack the extreme Left, particularly Trotskyites and militants of the POUM before liquidating Franco.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Maxim Litvinov: A Biography|last=Holroyd-Doveton|first=John|publisher=Woodland Publications|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=384}}</ref> Those who had served in Spain were tainted in Stalin's view and were singled out for harshness in the purges and were virtually all eliminated. The defector Orlov, who worked for the NKVD in Spain, confirms that he was told by a General, whom Orlov did not want to name, that when the General returned to Moscow to seek further instructions, he was told that the Politburo had adopted a new line towards Spain. Until then, the policy of the Politburo was to assist Republican Spain by supplying armaments, Soviet pilots and tanks in order to bring about a speedy victory over Franco; but now the Politburo had revised its strategy. Stalin had come to the conclusion that \"It would be more advantageous to the Soviet Union if neither of the warring camps gained proponderant strength, and if the war in Spain dragged on as long as possible and thus tied up Hitler for a long time.\" The Soviet General who informed Orlov of this was shocked by the Machiavellian calculation of the Politburo which, in its desire to obtain time, wanted the Spanish people to bleed as long as possible.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Secret History of Stalin's Crimes|last=Orlov|first=Aleksandr|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=1953 Edition p. 238; 1954 Edition p. 244}}</ref>\n\n=== Rise to power ===\nThe designated leader of the uprising, General [[Jos\u00e9 Sanjurjo]], died on 20 July 1936, in a plane crash.

The Spanish Army of Morocco itself was split into two columns, one commanded by General [[Juan Yag\u00fce]] and the other commanded by Colonel [[Jos\u00e9 Enrique Varela|Jos\u00e9 Varela]].\n\nFrom 24 July a coordinating ''[[Military junta|junta]]'' was established, based at [[Burgos]]. Nominally led by Cabanellas, as the most senior general,<ref>[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p. 282: \"to pacify, rather than to dignify, him.\"</ref> it initially included Mola, three other generals, and two colonels; Franco was later added in early August.<ref>[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p. 282</ref> On 21 September it was decided that Franco was to be commander-in-chief (this unified command was opposed only by Cabanellas),<ref>[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p. 421</ref> and, after some discussion, with no more than a lukewarm agreement from Queipo de Llano and from Mola, also head of government.<ref>[[#Thomas|Thomas]], pp. 423\u2013424</ref> He was, doubtlessly, helped to this primacy by the fact that, in late July, Hitler had decided that all of Germany's aid to the nationalists would go to Franco.<ref>[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p. 356</ref>\n\nMola had been somewhat discredited as the main planner of the attempted coup that had now degenerated into a civil war, and was strongly identified with the [[Carlism|Carlist]] monarchists and not at all with the [[Falange]], a party with Fascist leanings and connections (\"phalanx\", a far-right Spanish political party founded by [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera]]), nor did he have good relations with Germany; Queipo de Llano and Cabanellas had both previously rebelled against the dictatorship of [[General]] [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]] and were therefore discredited in some nationalist circles; and Falangist leader Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera was in prison in [[Alicante]] (he would be executed a few months later) and the desire to keep a place open for him prevented any other Falangist leader from emerging as a possible head of state.

Franco: A personal and political biography. University of Wisconsin Pres, 2014, p.193</ref> After the [[Siege of Madrid|failed assault on Madrid]] in November 1936, Franco settled on a piecemeal approach to winning the war, rather than bold maneuvering. As with his decision to [[Siege of the Alc\u00e1zar|relieve the garrison]] at Toledo, this approach has been subject of some debate; some of his decisions, such as in June 1938 when he preferred to head for [[Valencia (autonomous community)|Valencia]] instead of [[Catalonia]], remain particularly controversial from a military viewpoint. Valencia, Castellon and Alicante saw the last Republican troops defeated by Franco.\n\nAlthough both Germany and Italy provided military support to Franco, the degree of influence of both powers on his direction of the war seems to have been very limited. Nevertheless, the Italian troops, despite [[Battle of Guadalajara|not being always effective]], were present in most of the large operations in large numbers, while the German aircraft helped the Nationalist air force dominate the skies for most of the war.\n\nFranco's direction of the German and Italian forces was limited, particularly in the direction of the [[Condor Legion]], but he was by default their supreme commander, and they rarely made decisions on their own. For reasons of prestige it was decided to continue assisting Franco until the end of the war, and Italian and German troops paraded on the day of the final victory in Madrid.<ref name=jackson/>\n\nThe Nationalist victory could be accounted for by various factors:<ref>Payne, Stanley G., and Jes\u00fas Palacios.

Historian James S. Corum states:\n:As an ardent Nazi, [Ambassador Wilhelm] Faupel disliked Catholicism as well as the Spanish upper classes, and encouraged the working-class extremist members of the Falange to build a fascist party. Faupel devoted long audiences with Franco to convincing him of the necessity of remolding the Falange in the image of the Nazi Party. Faupel's interference in internal Spanish politics ran counter to Franco's policy of building a nationalist coalition of businessmen, monarchists and conservative Catholics, as well as Falangists.<ref>James S.

Whealey provides more detail:\n:Whereas Franco's crusade was a counterrevolution, the arrogant Faupel associated the Falange with the \"revolutionary\" doctrines of National Socialism. He sought to provide Spain's poor with an alternative to \"Jewish internationalist Marxist-Leninism.\"....

Unlike some other fascist movements, the Falangists had developed an official program in 1934, the \"Twenty-Seven Points\".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Payne|first=Stanley G.|year=1961|title=Falange: A History of Spanish Fascism|publisher=Stanford University Press|url=https://archive.org/details/falangehistoryof00payn|url-access=registration|pages=[https://archive.org/details/falangehistoryof00payn/page/68 68]\u201369|isbn=9780804700580}}</ref> In 1937, Franco assumed as the tentative doctrine of his regime 26 out of the original 27 points.<ref>[[#Payne1999|Payne (1999)]], p. 269</ref> Franco made himself ''jefe nacional'' (National Chief) of the new FET (''Falange Espa\u00f1ola Tradicionalista''; Traditionalist Spanish Phalanx) with a secretary, Junta Political and National Council to be named subsequently by himself.

Franco's brother-in-law [[Ram\u00f3n Serrano S\u00fa\u00f1er]], who was his main political advisor, was able to turn the various parties under Franco against each other to absorb a series of political confrontations against Franco himself. Franco expelled the original leading members of both the Carlists ([[Manuel Fal Cond\u00e9]]) and the Falangists ([[Manuel Hedilla]]) to secure his political future. Franco also appeased the Carlists by exploiting the Republicans' [[anti-clericalism]] in his propaganda, in particular concerning the \"[[Martyrs of the Spanish Civil War|Martyrs of the war]]\". While the Republican forces presented the war as a struggle to defend the Republic against Fascism, Franco depicted himself as the defender of \"Catholic Spain\" against \"atheist communism.\"\n\n=== The end of the Civil War ===\nBy early 1939 only Madrid (see [[History of Madrid]]) and a few other areas remained under control of the government forces. On 27 February [[Neville Chamberlain|Chamberlain's Britain]] and [[\u00c9douard Daladier|Daladier's France]] officially recognised the Franco regime. On 28 March 1939, with the help of pro-Franco forces inside the city (the \"[[fifth column]]\" General Mola had mentioned in propaganda broadcasts in 1936), Madrid fell to the Nationalists. The next day, [[Valencia]], which had held out under the guns of the Nationalists for close to two years, also surrendered. Victory was proclaimed on 1 April 1939, when the last of the Republican forces surrendered. On the same day, Franco placed his sword upon the altar of a church and in a vow, promised that he would never again take up his sword unless Spain itself was threatened with invasion.\n\nAlthough Germany had recognised the Franco Government, Franco's policy towards Germany was extremely cautious until spectacular German victories at the beginning of the Second World War. An early indication that Franco was going to keep his distance from Germany soon proved true'''.'''<ref name=\":0\" /> A rumoured state visit by Franco to Germany did not take place and a further rumour of a visit by Goering to Spain, after he had enjoyed a cruise in the Western Mediterranean, again did not materialise.

For the first four years after taking Madrid, he ruled almost exclusively by decree. The \"Law of the Head of State,\" passed in August 1939, \"permanently confided\" all governing power to Franco; he was not required to even consult the cabinet for most legislation or decrees.<ref>[[#Payne (1987)|Payne(1987)]], p. 231-234.</ref> According to Payne, Franco possessed far more day-to-day power than Hitler or Stalin possessed at the respective heights of their power.

It was elected in accordance with corporatist principles, and had little real power. Notably, it had no control over government spending, and the government was not responsible to it; ministers were appointed and dismissed by Franco alone.\n\nOn 26 July 1947 Franco proclaimed Spain a monarchy, but did not designate a monarch. This gesture was largely done to appease the monarchists in the ''[[Movimiento Nacional]]'' ([[Carlism|Carlists]] and [[Legitimism|Alfonsists]]). Franco left the throne vacant until 1969, proclaiming himself as a ''de facto'' [[regent]] for life. At the same time, Franco appropriated many of the privileges of a king. He wore the uniform of a [[Captain General]] (a rank traditionally reserved for the King) and resided in [[Royal Palace of El Pardo|El Pardo Palace]]. In addition he began walking under a [[baldachin|canopy]], and his portrait appeared on most [[Spanish coins]] and postage stamps. He also added \"[[by the grace of God]]\", a phrase usually part of the styles of monarchs, to his style.\n\nFranco initially sought support from various groups. His administration marginalised fascist ideologues in favor of [[technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocrats]], many of whom were linked with [[Opus Dei]], who promoted economic modernisation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/estoc.html#es0034 |title=The Franco Years: Policies, Programs, and Growing Popular Unrest |work=A Country Study: Spain |publisher=Library of Congress Country Studies}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Franco eisenhower 1959 madrid.jpg|thumb|left|Franco with U.S. President [[Dwight D.

Estimation is difficult and controversial, [[#The end of the Civil War|but the total number of people who were killed during this period probably lies somewhere between 15,000 and 50,000]].\n\nBy the start of the 1950s Franco's state had become less violent, but during his entire rule, non-government trade unions and all political opponents across the [[political spectrum]], from [[Communism|communist]] and [[Anarchism|anarchist]] organisations to [[liberal democracy|liberal democrats]] and [[Catalan nationalism|Catalan]] or [[Basque nationalism|Basque]] separatists, were either suppressed or tightly controlled with all means, up to and including violent police repression. The ''[[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo]]'' (CNT) and the ''[[Uni\u00f3n General de Trabajadores]]'' (UGT) trade unions were outlawed, and replaced in 1940 by the corporatist ''[[Sindicato Vertical]]''. The [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] and the ''[[Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya]]'' (ERC) were banned in 1939, while the [[Communist Party of Spain]] (PCE) went underground. The [[Basque Nationalist Party]] (PNV) went into exile, and in 1959 the [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] armed group was created to wage a [[low-intensity warfare|low-intensity war]] against Franco.\n\nFranco's Spanish nationalism promoted a unitary national identity by repressing Spain's cultural diversity. [[Bullfighting]] and [[flamenco]]<ref>Roman, Mar (27 October 2007).

Franco's view of Spanish tradition was somewhat artificial and arbitrary: while some regional traditions were suppressed, [[Flamenco]], an [[Andalusia]]n tradition, was considered part of a larger, national identity. All cultural activities were subject to censorship, and many, such as the [[Sardana]], the national dance of [[Catalonia]], were plainly forbidden (often in an erratic manner). This cultural policy was relaxed over time, most notably during the late 1960s and early 1970s.\n\nFranco also used [[Language policies of Francoist Spain|language politics]] in an attempt to establish national homogeneity. He promoted the use of [[Castilian Spanish]] and suppressed other languages such as [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Galician language|Galician]], and [[Basque language|Basque]]. The legal usage of languages other than Castilian was forbidden. All government, notarial, legal and commercial documents were to be drawn up exclusively in Castilian and any documents written in other languages were deemed null and void. The usage of any other language was forbidden in schools, in advertising, and on road and shop signs. For unofficial use, citizens continued to speak these languages. This was the situation throughout the 1940s and to a lesser extent during the 1950s, but after 1960 the non-Castilian Spanish languages were freely spoken and written, and they reached bookshops and stages, although they never received official status.\n\nOn the other hand, the [[Catholic Church]] was upheld as the [[established church]] of the Spanish State, and it regained many of the traditional privileges which it had lost under the Republic. Civil servants had to be Catholic, and some official jobs even required a \"good behavior\" statement by a priest. Civil marriages which had taken place in Republican Spain were declared null and void unless they had been confirmed by the Catholic Church. [[Divorce]] was forbidden, along with [[Birth control|contraceptives]], and [[abortion]].{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nMost country towns and rural areas were patrolled by pairs of ''[[Guardia Civil (Spain)|Guardia Civil]]'', a military police force for civilians, which functioned as Franco's chief means of social control. Larger cities and capitals were mostly under the jurisdiction of the [[Policia Armada]], or the ''[[grises]]'' (\"greys\", due to the colour of their uniforms) as they were called.\n\nStudent revolts at universities in the late 1960s and early 1970s were violently repressed by the heavily armed ''Polic\u00eda Armada'' (Armed Police). Plain-clothed secret police worked inside Spanish universities.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe enforcement by public authorities of traditional [[Catholic values]] was a stated intent of the regime, mainly by using a law (the ''Ley de Vagos y Maleantes'', Vagrancy Act) enacted by [[Manuel Aza\u00f1a|Aza\u00f1a]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://search.boe.es/g/es/bases_datos/tifs.php?coleccion=gazeta&anyo=1933&nbo=217&lim=A&pub=BOE&pco=874&pfi=877 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012090326/http://search.boe.es/g/es/bases_datos/tifs.php?coleccion=gazeta&anyo=1933&nbo=217&lim=A&pub=BOE&pco=874&pfi=877 |archivedate=12 October 2007 |title=Gazeta hist\u00f3rica: Referencia: P\u00e1ginas TIFF |publisher=Bolet\u00edn Oficial del Estado |url-status=dead |df=mdy}}</ref> The remaining nomads of Spain ([[Romani people in Spain|Gitanos]] and [[Merchero]]s like [[Eleuterio S\u00e1nchez|El Lute]]) were especially affected.

Official propaganda confined the role of women to family care and motherhood. Immediately after the civil war most progressive laws passed by the Republic aimed at equality between the sexes were nullified. Women could not become judges, or testify in a trial. They could not become university professors. Their affairs and economic lives had to be managed by their fathers and husbands. Until the 1970s a woman could not have a bank account without a [[co-sign]] by her father or husband.<ref>Tremlett, Giles (2006). ''Ghosts of Spain''. Faber and Faber Ltd.

During the [[Algerian War]] (1954\u201362), Madrid became the base of the ''[[Organisation arm\u00e9e secr\u00e8te]]'' (OAS), a right-wing French Army group which sought to preserve [[French rule in Algeria|French Algeria]]. Despite this, Franco was forced to make some concessions. When [[French Morocco]] became independent in 1956, he surrendered [[Spanish Morocco]] to [[Mohammed V of Morocco|Mohammed V]], retaining only a few enclaves (the ''[[Plazas de soberan\u00eda]]''). The year after, Mohammed V invaded [[Spanish Sahara]] during the [[Ifni War]] (known as the \"Forgotten War\" in Spain). Only in 1975, with the [[Green March]], did Morocco take control of all of the former Spanish territories in the Sahara.\n\nIn 1968, under pressure from the [[United Nations]],<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Campos|first1=Alicia|title=The Decolonization of Equatorial Guinea: The Relevance of the International Factor|journal=The Journal of African History|date=2003|volume=44|issue=1|pages=95\u2013116|doi=10.1017/s0021853702008319}}</ref> Franco granted Spain's colony of [[Equatorial Guinea]] its independence, and the next year it ceded the [[exclave]] of [[Ifni]] to [[Morocco]]. Under Franco, Spain also pursued a campaign to force a negotiation on the [[British overseas territory]] of [[Gibraltar]], and [[Disputed status of Gibraltar|closed its border with that territory]] in 1969. The border would not be fully reopened until 1985.\n\n=== Economic policy ===\n{{See also|Economic history of Spain#The Franco Era, 1939-75|l1=Economic history of Spain: Economy under Franco}}\nThe Civil War ravaged the Spanish economy.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Collier|first1=Paul|title=On the economic consequences of civil war|journal=Oxford Economic Papers |volume=51|date=1999|pages=168\u2013183|doi=10.1093/oep/51.1.168|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5808497fa94e6896ad350d122c578ef431528b7e}}</ref> Infrastructure had been damaged, workers killed, and daily business severely hampered. For more than a decade after Franco's victory, the devastated economy recovered very slowly. Franco initially pursued a policy of [[autarky]], cutting off almost all international trade. The policy had devastating effects, and the economy stagnated. Only black marketeers could enjoy an evident affluence.\n\n[[File:Spanish peseta coin with Franco 1963.gif|thumb|left|1963 [[Spanish peseta]] coin with an image of Franco and lettering reading: \"Francisco Franco, Leader of Spain, by the grace of God\"]]\nOn the brink of bankruptcy, a combination of pressure from the [[United States]], the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], managed to convince the regime to adopt a free market economy. Many of the old guard in charge of the economy were replaced by \"technocrata\", despite some initial opposition from Franco. From the mid-1950s there was modest acceleration in economic activity after some minor reforms and a relaxation of controls. But the growth proved too much for the economy, with shortages and inflation breaking out towards the end of the 1950s.\n\nWhen Franco replaced his ideological ministers with the apolitical technocrats, the regime implemented several development policies that included deep economic reforms. After a recession, growth took off from 1959, creating an economic boom that lasted until 1974, and became known as the \"[[Spanish Miracle]]\".\n\nConcurrent with the absence of social reforms, and the economic power shift, a tide of mass emigration commenced to other European countries, and to a lesser extent, to South America. Emigration helped the regime in two ways. The country got rid of populations it would not have been able to keep in employment, and the emigrants supplied the country with much needed monetary remittances.\n\nDuring the 1960s, the wealthy classes of Francoist Spain experienced further increases in wealth, particularly those who remained politically faithful, while a burgeoning middle class became visible as the \"economic miracle\" progressed. International firms established factories in Spain where salaries were low, company taxes very low, strikes forbidden and workers' health or state protections almost unheard of. State-owned firms like the car manufacturer [[SEAT]], truck builder [[Pegaso]] and oil refiner INH, massively expanded production. Furthermore, Spain was virtually a new mass market. Spain became the second-fastest growing economy in the world between 1959 and 1973, just behind Japan. By the time of Franco's death in 1975, Spain still lagged behind most of Western Europe but the gap between its per capita GDP and that of the leading Western European countries had narrowed greatly, and the country had developed a large industrialised economy.\n\n=== Regions ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}\n[[File:Visita de Francisco Franco a la localidad de Tolosa (5 de 21) - Fondo Car-Kutxa Fototeka.jpg|thumb|Franco's visit to [[Tolosa, Spain|Tolosa]] in 1948]]\nFranco was reluctant to enact any form of administrative and legislative decentralisation and kept a fully centralised government with a similar administrative structure to that established by the [[House of Bourbon]] and General [[Miguel Primo de Rivera y Orbaneja]]. Such structures were based on the model of the French centralised state. The main drawback of this kind of management was that government attention and initiatives were irregular, and often depended more on the goodwill of regional government representatives than on regional needs. Thus, inequalities in schooling, health care and transport facilities among regions were patent: classically affluent regions like Madrid, Catalonia, or the Basque Country fared much better than Extremadura, Galicia or Andalusia. Some regions, like Extremadura or La Mancha did not have a university.\n\nThe Basque Country and Catalonia were among the regions that offered the strongest resistance to Franco in the Civil War{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}. Franco dissolved the autonomy granted by the [[Second Spanish Republic]] to these two regions and to [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]. Franco abolished the centuries-old{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}} fiscal privileges and autonomy (the ''[[fueros]]'') of two of the three Basque provinces: [[Guipuzcoa]] and [[Biscay]], but kept them for [[\u00c1lava]] which had sided with the nationalists in the civil war.\n\nFranco also decided to preserve [[Navarre]]'s centuries old fiscal privileges and autonomy, the so-called [[Fueros of Navarre]]. Navarre, the northern half of which was Basque-speaking, was one of Franco's areas of greatest support during the civil war. The regional privileges for \u00c1lava and Navarre were kept because they had participated in the initial ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' against the Republican government on 18 July 1936.\n\nFranco abolished the official statute and recognition of the [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Galician language|Galician]], and [[Catalan language]]s that the [[Second Spanish Republic]] had granted for the first time in the history of Spain. He returned to Castilian as the only official language of the state and education. The Franco era saw the popularisation of the compulsory national educational system and the development of modern mass media, both controlled by the state and both using the Castilian language, which significantly reduced the number of speakers of Basque, Catalan and Galician, as happened during the second half of the 20th century with other European minority languages which were not officially protected, such as [[Scottish Gaelic]] or French [[Breton language|Breton]]. By the 1970s the majority of the population in urban areas could not speak the [[minority language]] or, as in some Catalan towns, their social use had been abandoned, leaving them limited to family use.\n\nBecause of the already fragile situation of the Basque language before the Civil War, it became the most endangered language in Spain{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}. By the 1970s Basque lacked a sufficient number of new speakers to assure its future, and moved closer to extinction. It is now recognised that the Basque language would have disappeared in a few more decades if the same linguistic policies had been preserved. This was the main reason that drove the Francoist provincial government of [[\u00c1lava]] to create a network of Basque medium schools ([[Ikastola]]) in 1973 which were state-financed.\n\n== Succession ==\n[[File:In Madrid is herdacht dat Franco 30 jaar geleden de burgeroorlog ( 1936 1939 ) w, Bestanddeelnr 922-4913 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Franco with Prince Juan Carlos in 1969]]\nFranco decided to name a monarch to succeed his regency but the simmering tensions between the [[Carlists]] and the Alfonsoists continued. In a bid to avoid a repeat of the [[Carlist Wars]], he offered the throne to the [[Habsburg]] Archduke [[Otto von Habsburg]]; by doing so he believed that he could eliminate the question of a [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] succession entirely since the Habsburg family which had ruled the [[Habsburg Spain]] during its golden age had an alternate claim to the Spanish throne before the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]. Archduke Otto declined, stating that he would be seen as a [[Germans|German]] ruling Spain and could never forget his [[Austrians|Austrian]] identity. In 1969 Franco nominated as his heir-apparent Prince [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos de Borb\u00f3n]], who had been educated by him in Spain, with the new title of Prince of Spain. This designation came as a surprise to the [[Carlism|Carlist]] pretender to the throne, as well as to Juan Carlos's father, [[Juan de Borb\u00f3n|Don Juan, the Count of Barcelona]], who had a superior claim to the throne, but whom Franco feared to be too liberal.\n\nHowever, when Juan Carlos asked Franco if he could sit in on cabinet meetings, Franco would not permit him saying; \"You would do things differently.\"<ref>Conversation between David Brightly (Ambassador to Spain 1994\u20131998) and John Holroyd-Doveton</ref> Due to the spread of democracy excluding the Soviet block in Europe since the Second World War, Juan Carlos could or would not have been a dictator in the way Franco had been.\n\nBy 1973 Franco had surrendered the function of prime minister (''Presidente del Gobierno''), remaining only as head of state and commander in chief of the military.\n\nAs his final years progressed, tensions within the various factions of the ''Movimiento'' would consume Spanish political life, as varying groups jockeyed for position in an effort to win control of the country's future. The [[assassination]] of prime minister [[Luis Carrero Blanco]] in the [[Assassination of Luis Carrero Blanco|20 December 1973 bombing]] by [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] eventually gave an edge to the liberalizing faction.\n\n== Death and funeral ==\n[[File:Carlos Arias Navarro and Franco 1975.jpg|right|thumb|[[Carlos Arias Navarro]] and Franco at his residence in October 1975, around one week before he fell into an irreversible coma]]\nOn 19 July 1974, the aged Franco fell ill from various health problems, and Juan Carlos took over as acting head of state. Franco soon recovered and on 2 September he resumed his duties as head of state. A year later he fell ill again, afflicted with further health issues, including a long battle with [[Parkinson's disease]].

But due to the navy being crippled by the [[Spanish-American War]] Franco instead joined the [[Spanish Army]] as a cadet in the [[Toledo Infantry Academy]] in 1907, graduating in 1910. He would then go on to serve in [[Spanish protectorate in Morocco|Morocco]], rapidly advancing through the ranks for bravery in combat and an assiduous attention to detail in logistics. In 1926 he became Brigadier General at age 33, the youngest General in all Europe,<ref>Television documentary from CC&C Ideacom Production, ''Apocalypse Never-Ending War 1918\u20131926'', part 2, aired at Danish DR K at 22.October 2018</ref> and two years later he became director of the [[General Military Academy]] in Zaragoza.{{sfn|Preston|1994|p=25}} \n\nAs a [[Conservatism|conservative]] and a [[Monarchism|monarchist]], Franco regretted the abolition of the [[Restoration (Spain)|monarchy]] and the establishment of the [[Second Spanish Republic|Second Republic]] in 1931. He was devastated by the closing of his beloved Academy, but nevertheless continued his service in the [[Spanish Republican Army|Republican Army]]. For a time he was even left without posting, but his career improved after the right-wing [[Confederaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola de Derechas Aut\u00f3nomas|CEDA]] and [[Radical Republican Party|PRR]] won the [[1933 Spanish general election|1933 election]]. In 1934 Franco led the brutal suppression of the [[Asturian miners' strike of 1934|uprising]] in [[Asturias]], sharpening the antagonism between [[Left-wing politics|Left]] and [[Right-wing politics|Right]] in the country. In 1935 he became [[Chief of Staff of the Army (Spain)|Chief of Army Staff]], but when the leftist [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]] won the [[1936 Spanish general election|1936 election]] Franco was once again marginalized, being relieved of his position and relegated to the [[Canary Islands]]. When [[Jos\u00e9 Calvo Sotelo|Calvo Sotelo]], leader of the opposition, was murdered that summer it triggered [[Spanish coup of July 1936|a military coup]] which had been plotted since the election in February. Franco had initially kept his distance from the plot, but joined in the last minute with complete resolution. The coup failed and precipitated the [[Spanish Civil War]]. \n\nFranco took control of the [[Army of Africa (Spain)|Army of Africa]], which was air-lifted to Spain. With the death of the other leading generals, Franco became [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|his faction's]] only leader and was appointed [[Generalissimo]] and [[List of heads of state of Spain#Francoist Spain (1936\u20131975)|Head of State]] in the autumn of 1936. By a [[Unification Decree (Spain, 1937)|Unification Decree]] in 1937 Franco merged all [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist parties]] into a [[one-party state|single party]], the [[FET y de las JONS]]. In 1939 the Nationalists had won the war, which had claimed almost half a million lives. The victory extended [[Francoist Spain|Franco's dictatorship]] over all of Spain, and it was followed by a period of [[White Terror (Spain)#Postwar|repression of political opponents and dissenters]].

He nurtured a [[cult of personality]] and the ''[[Movimiento Nacional]]'' became the only channel of participation in Spanish public life. During [[World War II]] he espoused [[neutral country|neutrality]] as [[Spain during World War II|Spain's official wartime policy]], but supported the [[Axis powers|Axis]]&nbsp;\u2014 whose members [[Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] had supported him during the Civil War&nbsp;\u2014 in various ways. After the war, Spain was shunned and [[Pariah state|isolated]] by many other countries for nearly a decade. \n\nBy the 1950s the nature of Franco's regime changed from being openly [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] and severely repressive to an authoritarian system with limited [[Pluralism (political theory)|pluralism]].<ref>[[#Payne2000|Payne (2000)]], p. 645</ref> During the [[Cold War]] Franco became one of the world's foremost anti-Communist figures and his regime was assisted by [[First World|the West]], particularly the [[United States]].<ref name=\"Rubottom, R 1984\"/> Spain had suffered chronic economic depression in the late 1940s and early 1950s, but by abandoning [[autarky]] and pursuing economic liberalization Franco presided over the \"[[Spanish miracle]]\".

The introduction of the [[Organic Law of the State|Organic Law in 1966]] limited and clearly defined Franco's powers and officially created the office of [[Prime Minister of Spain|Prime Minister]]. In 1973, beset with old age, sickness, and wishing to partially relinquish the burden of governing Spain, Franco resigned as Prime Minister and was succeeded by Carrero Blanco. However, Franco remained as Head of State and Commander-in-Chief. Franco died in 1975 at the age of 82 and was buried in the [[Valle de los Ca\u00eddos]]. Through the power to appoint a king, granted to him by the 1947 [[Law of Succession to the Headship of the State]], he restored the monarchy before his death, appointing [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos]] as his successor and [[Monarchy of Spain|King of Spain]]. Juan Carlos led the [[Spanish transition to democracy]].\n\nFranco remains a controversial figure in Spanish history and the nature of his dictatorship changed over time. His reign was marked by both brutal repression, with thousands killed, and economic prosperity, which greatly improved the quality of life in Spain. His dictatorial style proved very adaptable, which could introduce social and economic reform, and the only consistent points in Franco's long rule were above all [[authoritarianism]], [[Spanish nationalism]], [[National Catholicism]], [[Anti-Masonry|anti-Freemasonry]], and [[anti-Communism]].\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:Padres-de-Franco.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.65|His parents with Francisco in arms, on the day of his baptism on 17 December 1892]]\nFranco was born at 12:30 on 4 December 1892 in the Calle Frutos Saavedra in [[Ferrol, Spain|El Ferrol]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]].<ref name=\"Preston, p. 1\">[[#Preston|Preston]], p. 1</ref> He was baptised thirteen days later at the military church of San Francisco, with the baptismal name Francisco Paulino Hermenegildo Te\u00f3dulo;<ref name=\"Preston, p. 1\"/> Francisco for his paternal grandfather, Paulino for his godfather, Hermenegildo for his maternal grandmother and godmother, and Te\u00f3dulo for the [[Calendar of saints|saint day]] of his birth.\n\nFranco was born into a seafaring family.

Her father, Landislao Bahamonde Ortega, was the commissar of naval equipment at the Port. Franco's parents married in 1890 in the Church of San Francisco in el Ferrol.<ref>[[#Preston|Preston]], p. 3</ref> The young Franco spent much of his childhood with his two brothers, [[Nicol\u00e1s Franco (politician)|Nicol\u00e1s]] (Ferrol, 1891\u20131977) and [[Ram\u00f3n Franco|Ram\u00f3n]], and his two sisters, Mar\u00eda del Pilar (Ferrol, 1894 \u2013 Madrid, 1989), and Mar\u00eda de la Paz (Ferrol, 1899 \u2013 Ferrol, 1903). The latter died in infancy. His brother Nicol\u00e1s was later a [[Spanish Navy|naval]] [[officer (armed forces)|officer]] and diplomat who in time married Mar\u00eda Isabel Pascual del Pobil y Ravello, and was seen as intelligent, the best student of all the siblings and also the most conventional of the brothers.{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|p=8}} Ram\u00f3n was an internationally renown pioneer [[aviator]], a [[Freemason]] with originally [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] political leanings and was generally the most audacious and rebellious brother, both socially and politically. He was also the second sibling to die, killed in an air accident on a military mission in 1938.{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|pp=8-9}} Mar\u00eda del Pilar was known for being lively and highly social; she married Alonso Jar\u00e1iz y Jer\u00e9z and had ten children, five after she was 45 years old; several of her sons would go on to have careers in the military, while two of her daughters would marry officers.{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|p=7}}\n\nFranco's father was an officer of the naval supply system who reached the rank of ''Intendente General'' (equivalent to Vice Admiral). He was an unconventional man, a well read free-thinker, agnostic and somewhat of a libertine. Franco's mother, by contrast, was loving, pious and self-sacrificing, obedient to her husband and never speaking ill of him despite suffering at his hand. When Franco was fourteen, his father moved away to Madrid after receiving a reassignment there and he would ultimately abandon his family, marrying another woman. While Franco did not suffer any great abuse at his father's hand, he would never overcome his antipathy for his father and largely ignored him for the rest of his life; years after becoming dictator, Franco wrote a brief novel ''Raza'' under the pseudonym Jaime de Andrade, whose protagonist is believed by Stanley Payne to represent the idealised man Franco wished his father had been. Conversely, Franco strongly identified with his mother (who always wore widow's black once she realised her husband had abandoned her) and learned from her moderation, austerity, self-control, family solidarity and respect for Catholicism, though he would also inherit his father's harshness, coldness and implacability.{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|pp=5-8}}\n\n== Military career ==\n=== Rif War and advancement through the ranks ===\nFrancisco was to follow his father into the Navy, but as a result of the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] the country lost much of its navy as well as most of its colonies. Not needing any more officers, the Naval Academy admitted no new entrants from 1906 to 1913. To his father's chagrin, Francisco decided to try the [[Spanish Army]]. In 1907, he entered the Infantry Academy in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]. At the age of fourteen, Franco was one of the youngest members of his class, with most boys being between sixteen and eighteen. He was quite short and was bullied for his small size. His grades were average, though his good memory meant he seldom struggled in mental tests but his small stature was a hindrance in physical tests. He would graduate in July 1910 as second lieutenant, coming 251 out of 312, though this may have been less to do with his grades than his small size, young age and reduced physical presence; Stanley Payne observes that by the time Civil War began, Franco had already become a major general and would soon be a generalissimo, while none of his higher-ranking fellow cadets had managed to get beyond the rank of lieutenant-colonel.{{Sfn|Jensen|2005|pp=13\u201314}}{{Sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|pp=12\u201315}} At 19, Franco was promoted to the rank of first lieutenant in June 1912.{{Sfn|Jensen|2005|p=28}}<ref>{{Cite book|title=Franco : a concise biography|last=Ashford.|first=Hodges, Gabrielle|date=2002|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-0312282851|edition=1st U.S.|location=New York|oclc=49386039|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/francoconcisebio0000hodg}}</ref> Two years later, he obtained a commission to Morocco. Spanish efforts to occupy their new African [[protectorate]] provoked the [[Second Melillan campaign]] in 1909 with native Moroccans, the first of a period of [[Riffians|Riffian]] rebellions. Their tactics resulted in heavy losses among Spanish [[officer (armed forces)|military officers]], and also provided an opportunity to earn promotion through merit. It was said that officers would receive either ''la caja o la faja'' (a coffin or a general's sash). Franco quickly gained a reputation as a good officer. [[File:Francisco y Ram\u00f3n Franco 1925.jpg|thumb|left|Francisco and his brother Ram\u00f3n in [[Spanish protectorate in Morocco|North Africa]], 1925]] In 1913, Franco transferred into the newly formed [[regulares]]: Moroccan colonial troops with Spanish officers, who acted as [[shock troops]]. This transfer into a perilous role may have been decided because Franco failed to win the hand of his first love, [[Sof\u00eda Subir\u00e1n]]. (The letters between the two were found and she was questioned by journalists.)\n\nIn 1916, aged 23 and already a captain, he was shot by enemy machine gun fire. He was badly wounded in the abdomen, specifically the liver, in a skirmish at ''El Biutz''. The physicians of the battle later concluded that his intestines were spared because he inhaled the moment he was shot. In 2008, it was alleged by historian Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Zavala that this injury had left Franco with only [[monorchism|one tesitcle]]. Zavala cites Ana Puigvert, whose father Antonio Puigvert, was Franco's physician.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/mundo/cultura_sociedad/2009/05/090518_1559_franco_lp |title=Franco, \"hombre de un s\u00f3lo test\u00edculo\" BBC News Mundo| access-date=27 January 2020}}</ref>.\n\nAt that time, abdominal wounds in Africa were normally fatal. His improbable survival marked him permanently in the eyes of the native troops as a man blessed with ''[[Barakah|baraka]]'' (in Islam, the beneficent force from God ). He was recommended for promotion to major and to receive Spain's highest honour for gallantry, the coveted ''[[Laureate Cross of Saint Ferdinand|Cruz Laureada de San Fernando]]''. Both proposals were denied citing the twenty three years old Franco's young age as the reason for denial. Instead received the prestigious ''Cross of Maria Cristina, First Class''.<ref>[[#Preston|Preston]]</ref>\n\nWith that he was promoted to major at the end of February 1917 at age 24. This made him the youngest major in the Spanish army. From 1917 to 1920, he served in Spain. In 1920, Lieutenant Colonel [[Jos\u00e9 Mill\u00e1n Astray]], a [[wikt:histrionic|histrionic]] but charismatic officer, founded the [[Spanish Foreign Legion]], on similar lines to the [[French Foreign Legion]]. Franco became the Legion's second-in-command and returned to Africa. In the [[Rif War]], on 24 July 1921, the poorly commanded and overextended Spanish Army suffered [[Battle of Annual|a crushing defeat]] at [[Annual (Morocco)|Annual]] from the [[The Republic of the Rif|Republic of the Rif]] led by the [[Muhammad Ibn 'Abd al-Karim al-Khattabi|Abd el-Krim]] brothers. The Legion and supporting units relieved the Spanish enclave of [[Melilla]] after a three-day forced march led by Franco. In 1923, by now a [[lieutenant colonel]], he was made commander of the Legion.\n\nOn 22 October 1923, Franco married [[Carmen Polo|Mar\u00eda del Carmen Polo y Mart\u00ednez-Vald\u00e8s]] (11 June 1900 \u2013 6 February 1988).<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://sites.jmu.edu/spanishcivilwar/carmenpolo/ | title=Carmen Polo: La Esposa de Francisco Franco \u2013 la Guerra Civil Espa\u00f1ola | access-date=30 December 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171231051755/https://sites.jmu.edu/spanishcivilwar/carmenpolo/ | archive-date=31 December 2017 | url-status=dead }}</ref> Three years later on 14 September 1926, the couple had a daughter, [[Carmen Franco y Polo|Mar\u00eda del Carmen]].

Promoted to [[colonel]], Franco led the first wave of troops ashore at [[Al Hoceima]] ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Alhucemas'') in 1925. This landing in the heartland of Abd el-Krim's tribe, combined with the French invasion from the south, spelled the beginning of the end for the short-lived [[Republic of the Rif]]. Franco's recognition eventually caught up with him and he was promoted to brigadier general on 3 February 1926. This made him the youngest general in Spain, and perhaps, along with [[Major-General]] [[Joseph Sweeney (Irish politician)|Joe Sweeney]] of the [[Irish Army]], one of the youngest generals in Europe. In 1928 Franco was appointed director of the newly created General Military Academy of Zaragoza, a new college for all army [[cadet]]s, replacing the former separate institutions for young men seeking to become officers in infantry, cavalry, artillery, and other branches of the army. Franco was removed as Director of the Zaragoza Military Academy in 1931; about 95% of his former Zaragoza cadets later came to side with him in the Civil War.\n\n=== During the Second Spanish Republic ===\nThe municipal elections of April 12, 1931 were largely seen as plebiscite on the monarchy. The Republican-Socialist alliance failed to win the majority of the municipality cities in Spain but had a landslide victory in all large cities and in almost all provincial capitals.{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|p=66}} The monarchists and the army deserted Alfonso XIII and the King decided to leave the country into exile, giving way to the [[Second Spanish Republic]]. Although Franco believed that the majority of the Spanish people still supported the crown, and although he regretted the end of the monarchy, he did not object, nor did he challenge the legitimacy of the republic.{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|p=68}} But the closing of the Academy in June by War Minister [[Manuel Aza\u00f1a]] was a major setback for Franco and provoked his first clash with the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republic]].

The conspiracy suggested that Jews, Freemasons, Communists, and other leftists alike sought the destruction of Christian Europe, with Spain the principal target.<ref>Preston, Paul (2010) \"The Theorists of Extermination\", essay in ''Unearthing Franco's Legacy'', pp. 42, 45.

Franco avoided involvement in [[Jos\u00e9 Sanjurjo]]'s attempted coup that year, and even wrote a hostile letter to Sanjurjo expressing his anger over the attempt. As a result of Aza\u00f1a's military reform, in January 1933 Franco was relegated from first to 24th in the list of brigadiers. The same year, on 17 February he was given the military command of the [[Balearic Islands]]. The post was above his rank, but Franco was still angered that he was purposely stuck in positions he disliked. It was quite common for conservative officers to be moved or demoted, however.\n\nThe elections held in October 1933 resulted in a centre-right majority. The political party with the most votes was the Confederaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ol de Derechas Aut\u00f3nomas (\"CEDA\"), but president [[Niceto Alcal\u00e1-Zamora|Alcal\u00e1-Zamora]] declined to invite the leader of the CEDA, Gil Robles, to form a government. Instead he invited the [[Radical Republican Party]]'s [[Alejandro Lerroux]] to do so. Despite receiving the most votes, CEDA was denied cabinet positions for nearly a year.{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|pp=84-85}} After a year of intense pressure, CEDA, the largest party in the congress, was finally successful in forcing the acceptance of three ministries.

After various postponements, 18 July was fixed as the date of the uprising.

Despite the [[Non-Intervention Agreement]] of August 1936, the war was marked by [[Foreign involvement in the Spanish Civil War|foreign intervention]] on behalf of both sides, leading to international repercussions. The nationalist side was supported by [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]], which sent the ''[[Corpo Truppe Volontarie]]'', and later by [[Nazi Germany]], which assisted with the [[Condor Legion]]. They were opposed by the [[Soviet Union]] and communists, socialists and anarchists within Spain. The [[United Kingdom]] and [[French Third Republic|France]] strictly adhered to the arms embargo,{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} provoking dissensions within the [[Popular Front (France)|French Popular Front]] coalition which was led by [[L\u00e9on Blum]], but the Republican side was nonetheless supported by the Soviet Union and volunteers who fought in the [[International Brigades]] (see for example [[Ken Loach]]'s ''[[Land and Freedom]]'').\n\nBecause [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Joseph Stalin]] used the war as a testing ground for modern warfare, some historians, such as [[Ernst Nolte]], have considered the Spanish Civil War, along with World War II, to be part of a [[European Civil War]] which lasted from 1936 to 1945 and was mainly characterised as a [[left-wing politics|left]]/[[right-wing politics|right]] ideological conflict. This interpretation has not been accepted by most historians, who consider the Spanish Civil War and the Second World War to be two distinct conflicts. Among other things, they point to the political heterogeneity on both sides (''See [[Spanish Civil War#Other factions|Spanish Civil War: other factions]]'') and criticise a monolithic interpretation, which overlooks the local nuances of [[History of Spain|Spanish history]].\n\n=== The first months ===\nFollowing 18 July 1936 ''[[pronunciamiento]]'', Franco assumed the leadership of the 30,000 soldiers of the [[Spanish Army of Africa]]. The first days of the insurgency were marked with a serious need to secure control over the [[Spanish Morocco|Spanish Moroccan Protectorate]]. On one side, Franco had to win the support of the natives and their (nominal) authorities, and, on the other, had to ensure his control over the army. His method was the summary execution of some 200 senior officers loyal to the Republic (one of them his own cousin). His loyal bodyguard was shot by Manuel Blanco.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.memoriahistocheeserica.org/alojados/periquete/paginas/noticias1.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170129081724/http://memoriahistocheeserica.org/alojados/periquete/paginas/noticias1.html | url-status = dead | archive-date = 29 January 2017 | title = La Memoria de los Nuestros | language = Spanish | accessdate = 21 July 2006}}</ref> Franco's first problem was how to move his troops to the [[Iberian Peninsula]], since most units of the Navy had remained in control of the Republic and were blocking the [[Strait of Gibraltar]]. He requested help from [[Benito Mussolini]], who responded with an unconditional offer of arms and planes; in Germany [[Wilhelm Canaris]], the head of the ''[[Abwehr]]'' military intelligence, persuaded Hitler to support the Nationalists. From 20 July onward Franco was able, with a small group of 22 mainly German [[Junkers Ju 52]] aircraft, to initiate an [[Airbridge (logistics)|air bridge]] to [[Seville]], where his troops helped to ensure the rebel control of the city. Through representatives, he started to negotiate with the United Kingdom, Germany, and Italy for more military support, and above all for more aircraft. Negotiations were successful with the last two on 25 July and aircraft began to arrive in [[Tetouan]] on 2 August. On 5 August Franco was able to break the blockade with the newly arrived air support, successfully deploying a ship convoy with some 2,000 soldiers.\n\nIn early August, the situation in western [[Andalusia]] was stable enough to allow him to organise a column (some 15,000 men at its height), under the command of then Lieutenant-Colonel [[Juan Yag\u00fce]], which would march through [[Extremadura]] towards Madrid. On 11 August [[Battle of M\u00e9rida|M\u00e9rida was taken]], and on 15 August [[Battle of Badajoz (1936)|Badajoz]], thus joining both nationalist-controlled areas. Additionally, Mussolini ordered a voluntary army, the ''[[Corpo Truppe Volontarie]]'' (CTV) of some 12,000 Italians of fully motorised units to Seville and Hitler added to them a professional squadron from the [[Luftwaffe]] (2JG/88) with about 24 planes. All these planes had the Nationalist Spanish insignia painted on them, but were flown by Italian and German nationals. The backbone of Franco's aviation in those days were the Italian [[SM.79]] and [[SM.81]] bombers, the biplane Fiat [[CR.32]] fighter and the German [[Junkers Ju 52]] cargo-bomber and the [[Heinkel He 51]] biplane fighter.\n\nOn 21 September, with the head of the column at the town of [[Maqueda]] (some 80&nbsp;km away from Madrid), Franco ordered a detour to free the [[Siege of the Alc\u00e1zar|besieged garrison at the Alc\u00e1zar]] of [[Toledo (Spain)|Toledo]], which was achieved on 27 September. This controversial decision gave the [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]] time to strengthen its defenses in Madrid and hold the city that year, but with Soviet support.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Maxim Litvinov: A Biography|last=Holroyd-Doveton|first=John|publisher=Woodland Publications|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=380}}</ref> Kennan alleges that, once Stalin had decided to assist the Spanish Republicans, the operation was put in place with remarkable speed and energy. The first load of arms and tanks arrives as early as 26 September and was secretly unloaded at night. Advisers accompanied the armaments.

A more likely motive was Stalin's instinct for self-preservation, because the Spanish Civil War had aroused a spirit of heroism in support of freedom more in line with Trotskyism and such ideas might be exported to the Soviet Union. Further proof of this is what Modin stated that Stalin decided to attack the extreme Left, particularly Trotskyites and militants of the POUM before liquidating Franco.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Maxim Litvinov: A Biography|last=Holroyd-Doveton|first=John|publisher=Woodland Publications|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=384}}</ref> Those who had served in Spain were tainted in Stalin's view and were singled out for harshness in the purges and were virtually all eliminated. The defector Orlov, who worked for the NKVD in Spain, confirms that he was told by a General, whom Orlov did not want to name, that when the General returned to Moscow to seek further instructions, he was told that the Politburo had adopted a new line towards Spain. Until then, the policy of the Politburo was to assist Republican Spain by supplying armaments, Soviet pilots and tanks in order to bring about a speedy victory over Franco; but now the Politburo had revised its strategy. Stalin had come to the conclusion that \"It would be more advantageous to the Soviet Union if neither of the warring camps gained proponderant strength, and if the war in Spain dragged on as long as possible and thus tied up Hitler for a long time.\" The Soviet General who informed Orlov of this was shocked by the Machiavellian calculation of the Politburo which, in its desire to obtain time, wanted the Spanish people to bleed as long as possible.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Secret History of Stalin's Crimes|last=Orlov|first=Aleksandr|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=1953 Edition p. 238; 1954 Edition p. 244}}</ref>\n\n=== Rise to power ===\nThe designated leader of the uprising, General [[Jos\u00e9 Sanjurjo]], died on 20 July 1936, in a plane crash.

The Spanish Army of Morocco itself was split into two columns, one commanded by General [[Juan Yag\u00fce]] and the other commanded by Colonel [[Jos\u00e9 Enrique Varela|Jos\u00e9 Varela]].\n\nFrom 24 July a coordinating ''[[Military junta|junta]]'' was established, based at [[Burgos]]. Nominally led by Cabanellas, as the most senior general,<ref>[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p. 282: \"to pacify, rather than to dignify, him.\"</ref> it initially included Mola, three other generals, and two colonels; Franco was later added in early August.<ref>[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p. 282</ref> On 21 September it was decided that Franco was to be commander-in-chief (this unified command was opposed only by Cabanellas),<ref>[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p. 421</ref> and, after some discussion, with no more than a lukewarm agreement from Queipo de Llano and from Mola, also head of government.<ref>[[#Thomas|Thomas]], pp. 423\u2013424</ref> He was, doubtlessly, helped to this primacy by the fact that, in late July, Hitler had decided that all of Germany's aid to the nationalists would go to Franco.<ref>[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p. 356</ref>\n\nMola had been somewhat discredited as the main planner of the attempted coup that had now degenerated into a civil war, and was strongly identified with the [[Carlism|Carlist]] monarchists and not at all with the [[Falange]], a party with Fascist leanings and connections (\"phalanx\", a far-right Spanish political party founded by [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera]]), nor did he have good relations with Germany; Queipo de Llano and Cabanellas had both previously rebelled against the dictatorship of [[General]] [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]] and were therefore discredited in some nationalist circles; and Falangist leader Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera was in prison in [[Alicante]] (he would be executed a few months later) and the desire to keep a place open for him prevented any other Falangist leader from emerging as a possible head of state.

Franco himself was not a strategic genius but he was very effective at organisation, administration, logistics and diplomacy.<ref>Payne, Stanley G., and Jes\u00fas Palacios. Franco: A personal and political biography. University of Wisconsin Pres, 2014, p.193</ref> After the [[Siege of Madrid|failed assault on Madrid]] in November 1936, Franco settled on a piecemeal approach to winning the war, rather than bold maneuvering. As with his decision to [[Siege of the Alc\u00e1zar|relieve the garrison]] at Toledo, this approach has been subject of some debate; some of his decisions, such as in June 1938 when he preferred to head for [[Valencia (autonomous community)|Valencia]] instead of [[Catalonia]], remain particularly controversial from a military viewpoint. Valencia, Castellon and Alicante saw the last Republican troops defeated by Franco.\n\nAlthough both Germany and Italy provided military support to Franco, the degree of influence of both powers on his direction of the war seems to have been very limited. Nevertheless, the Italian troops, despite [[Battle of Guadalajara|not being always effective]], were present in most of the large operations in large numbers, while the German aircraft helped the Nationalist air force dominate the skies for most of the war.\n\nFranco's direction of the German and Italian forces was limited, particularly in the direction of the [[Condor Legion]], but he was by default their supreme commander, and they rarely made decisions on their own. For reasons of prestige it was decided to continue assisting Franco until the end of the war, and Italian and German troops paraded on the day of the final victory in Madrid.<ref name=jackson/>\n\nThe Nationalist victory could be accounted for by various factors:<ref>Payne, Stanley G., and Jes\u00fas Palacios.

Historian James S. Corum states:\n:As an ardent Nazi, [Ambassador Wilhelm] Faupel disliked Catholicism as well as the Spanish upper classes, and encouraged the working-class extremist members of the Falange to build a fascist party. Faupel devoted long audiences with Franco to convincing him of the necessity of remolding the Falange in the image of the Nazi Party. Faupel's interference in internal Spanish politics ran counter to Franco's policy of building a nationalist coalition of businessmen, monarchists and conservative Catholics, as well as Falangists.<ref>James S. Corum, \"The Luftwaffe and the coalition air war in Spain, 1936\u20131939,\" ''Journal of Strategic Studies,'' (1995) 18:1, 68\u201390 quotation at p. 75.</ref>\nHistorian Robert H. Whealey provides more detail:\n:Whereas Franco's crusade was a counterrevolution, the arrogant Faupel associated the Falange with the \"revolutionary\" doctrines of National Socialism. He sought to provide Spain's poor with an alternative to \"Jewish internationalist Marxist-Leninism.\".... The old fashioned Alfonsists and Carlists who surrounded Franco viewed the Falangists as classless troublemakers.<ref>{{cite book|author=Robert H.

Unlike some other fascist movements, the Falangists had developed an official program in 1934, the \"Twenty-Seven Points\".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Payne|first=Stanley G.|year=1961|title=Falange: A History of Spanish Fascism|publisher=Stanford University Press|url=https://archive.org/details/falangehistoryof00payn|url-access=registration|pages=[https://archive.org/details/falangehistoryof00payn/page/68 68]\u201369|isbn=9780804700580}}</ref> In 1937, Franco assumed as the tentative doctrine of his regime 26 out of the original 27 points.<ref>[[#Payne1999|Payne (1999)]], p. 269</ref> Franco made himself ''jefe nacional'' (National Chief) of the new FET (''Falange Espa\u00f1ola Tradicionalista''; Traditionalist Spanish Phalanx) with a secretary, Junta Political and National Council to be named subsequently by himself. Five days later (24 April) the raised-arm salute of the Falange was made the official salute of the Nationalist regime.<ref>[[#Payne1987|Payne (1987)]], p. 172</ref> In 1939 the personalist style heavily predominated, with ritualistic invocations of \"Franco, Franco, Franco.\"<ref>[[#Payne1987|Payne (1987)]], p. 234</ref> The Falangists' hymn, ''[[Cara al Sol]]'', became the semi-national anthem of Franco's not-yet-established regime.\n\nThis new political formation appeased the pro-German Falangists while tempering them with the anti-German Carlists. Franco's brother-in-law [[Ram\u00f3n Serrano S\u00fa\u00f1er]], who was his main political advisor, was able to turn the various parties under Franco against each other to absorb a series of political confrontations against Franco himself. Franco expelled the original leading members of both the Carlists ([[Manuel Fal Cond\u00e9]]) and the Falangists ([[Manuel Hedilla]]) to secure his political future. Franco also appeased the Carlists by exploiting the Republicans' [[anti-clericalism]] in his propaganda, in particular concerning the \"[[Martyrs of the Spanish Civil War|Martyrs of the war]]\". While the Republican forces presented the war as a struggle to defend the Republic against Fascism, Franco depicted himself as the defender of \"Catholic Spain\" against \"atheist communism.\"\n\n=== The end of the Civil War ===\nBy early 1939 only Madrid (see [[History of Madrid]]) and a few other areas remained under control of the government forces. On 27 February [[Neville Chamberlain|Chamberlain's Britain]] and [[\u00c9douard Daladier|Daladier's France]] officially recognised the Franco regime. On 28 March 1939, with the help of pro-Franco forces inside the city (the \"[[fifth column]]\" General Mola had mentioned in propaganda broadcasts in 1936), Madrid fell to the Nationalists.

For the first four years after taking Madrid, he ruled almost exclusively by decree. The \"Law of the Head of State,\" passed in August 1939, \"permanently confided\" all governing power to Franco; he was not required to even consult the cabinet for most legislation or decrees.<ref>[[#Payne (1987)|Payne(1987)]], p. 231-234.</ref> According to Payne, Franco possessed far more day-to-day power than Hitler or Stalin possessed at the respective heights of their power.

It was elected in accordance with corporatist principles, and had little real power. Notably, it had no control over government spending, and the government was not responsible to it; ministers were appointed and dismissed by Franco alone.\n\nOn 26 July 1947 Franco proclaimed Spain a monarchy, but did not designate a monarch. This gesture was largely done to appease the monarchists in the ''[[Movimiento Nacional]]'' ([[Carlism|Carlists]] and [[Legitimism|Alfonsists]]). Franco left the throne vacant until 1969, proclaiming himself as a ''de facto'' [[regent]] for life. At the same time, Franco appropriated many of the privileges of a king. He wore the uniform of a [[Captain General]] (a rank traditionally reserved for the King) and resided in [[Royal Palace of El Pardo|El Pardo Palace]]. In addition he began walking under a [[baldachin|canopy]], and his portrait appeared on most [[Spanish coins]] and postage stamps. He also added \"[[by the grace of God]]\", a phrase usually part of the styles of monarchs, to his style.\n\nFranco initially sought support from various groups. His administration marginalised fascist ideologues in favor of [[technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocrats]], many of whom were linked with [[Opus Dei]], who promoted economic modernisation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/estoc.html#es0034 |title=The Franco Years: Policies, Programs, and Growing Popular Unrest |work=A Country Study: Spain |publisher=Library of Congress Country Studies}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Franco eisenhower 1959 madrid.jpg|thumb|left|Franco with U.S. President [[Dwight D.

Estimation is difficult and controversial, [[#The end of the Civil War|but the total number of people who were killed during this period probably lies somewhere between 15,000 and 50,000]].\n\nBy the start of the 1950s Franco's state had become less violent, but during his entire rule, non-government trade unions and all political opponents across the [[political spectrum]], from [[Communism|communist]] and [[Anarchism|anarchist]] organisations to [[liberal democracy|liberal democrats]] and [[Catalan nationalism|Catalan]] or [[Basque nationalism|Basque]] separatists, were either suppressed or tightly controlled with all means, up to and including violent police repression. The ''[[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo]]'' (CNT) and the ''[[Uni\u00f3n General de Trabajadores]]'' (UGT) trade unions were outlawed, and replaced in 1940 by the corporatist ''[[Sindicato Vertical]]''. The [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] and the ''[[Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya]]'' (ERC) were banned in 1939, while the [[Communist Party of Spain]] (PCE) went underground. The [[Basque Nationalist Party]] (PNV) went into exile, and in 1959 the [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] armed group was created to wage a [[low-intensity warfare|low-intensity war]] against Franco.\n\nFranco's Spanish nationalism promoted a unitary national identity by repressing Spain's cultural diversity. [[Bullfighting]] and [[flamenco]]<ref>Roman, Mar (27 October 2007). [https://web.archive.org/web/20170129082010/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20071027/flamenco-for-foreigners/ \"Spain frets over future of flamenco.\"] Associated Press.</ref> were promoted as national traditions while those traditions not considered \"Spanish\" were suppressed. Franco's view of Spanish tradition was somewhat artificial and arbitrary: while some regional traditions were suppressed, [[Flamenco]], an [[Andalusia]]n tradition, was considered part of a larger, national identity. All cultural activities were subject to censorship, and many, such as the [[Sardana]], the national dance of [[Catalonia]], were plainly forbidden (often in an erratic manner). This cultural policy was relaxed over time, most notably during the late 1960s and early 1970s.\n\nFranco also used [[Language policies of Francoist Spain|language politics]] in an attempt to establish national homogeneity. He promoted the use of [[Castilian Spanish]] and suppressed other languages such as [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Galician language|Galician]], and [[Basque language|Basque]]. The legal usage of languages other than Castilian was forbidden. All government, notarial, legal and commercial documents were to be drawn up exclusively in Castilian and any documents written in other languages were deemed null and void. The usage of any other language was forbidden in schools, in advertising, and on road and shop signs. For unofficial use, citizens continued to speak these languages. This was the situation throughout the 1940s and to a lesser extent during the 1950s, but after 1960 the non-Castilian Spanish languages were freely spoken and written, and they reached bookshops and stages, although they never received official status.\n\nOn the other hand, the [[Catholic Church]] was upheld as the [[established church]] of the Spanish State, and it regained many of the traditional privileges which it had lost under the Republic. Civil servants had to be Catholic, and some official jobs even required a \"good behavior\" statement by a priest. Civil marriages which had taken place in Republican Spain were declared null and void unless they had been confirmed by the Catholic Church. [[Divorce]] was forbidden, along with [[Birth control|contraceptives]], and [[abortion]].{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nMost country towns and rural areas were patrolled by pairs of ''[[Guardia Civil (Spain)|Guardia Civil]]'', a military police force for civilians, which functioned as Franco's chief means of social control. Larger cities and capitals were mostly under the jurisdiction of the [[Policia Armada]], or the ''[[grises]]'' (\"greys\", due to the colour of their uniforms) as they were called.\n\nStudent revolts at universities in the late 1960s and early 1970s were violently repressed by the heavily armed ''Polic\u00eda Armada'' (Armed Police). Plain-clothed secret police worked inside Spanish universities.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe enforcement by public authorities of traditional [[Catholic values]] was a stated intent of the regime, mainly by using a law (the ''Ley de Vagos y Maleantes'', Vagrancy Act) enacted by [[Manuel Aza\u00f1a|Aza\u00f1a]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://search.boe.es/g/es/bases_datos/tifs.php?coleccion=gazeta&anyo=1933&nbo=217&lim=A&pub=BOE&pco=874&pfi=877 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012090326/http://search.boe.es/g/es/bases_datos/tifs.php?coleccion=gazeta&anyo=1933&nbo=217&lim=A&pub=BOE&pco=874&pfi=877 |archivedate=12 October 2007 |title=Gazeta hist\u00f3rica: Referencia: P\u00e1ginas TIFF |publisher=Bolet\u00edn Oficial del Estado |url-status=dead |df=mdy}}</ref> The remaining nomads of Spain ([[Romani people in Spain|Gitanos]] and [[Merchero]]s like [[Eleuterio S\u00e1nchez|El Lute]]) were especially affected.

Official propaganda confined the role of women to family care and motherhood. Immediately after the civil war most progressive laws passed by the Republic aimed at equality between the sexes were nullified. Women could not become judges, or testify in a trial. They could not become university professors. Their affairs and economic lives had to be managed by their fathers and husbands. Until the 1970s a woman could not have a bank account without a [[co-sign]] by her father or husband.<ref>Tremlett, Giles (2006). ''Ghosts of Spain''. Faber and Faber Ltd. London. {{ISBN|0802716741}}. p. 211.</ref> In the 1960s and 1970s these restrictions were somewhat relaxed.\n\n=== The Spanish colonial empire and decolonisation ===\n{{Further|Spanish Empire}}\nSpain attempted to retain control of its colonial empire throughout Franco's rule. During the [[Algerian War]] (1954\u201362), Madrid became the base of the ''[[Organisation arm\u00e9e secr\u00e8te]]'' (OAS), a right-wing French Army group which sought to preserve [[French rule in Algeria|French Algeria]]. Despite this, Franco was forced to make some concessions. When [[French Morocco]] became independent in 1956, he surrendered [[Spanish Morocco]] to [[Mohammed V of Morocco|Mohammed V]], retaining only a few enclaves (the ''[[Plazas de soberan\u00eda]]''). The year after, Mohammed V invaded [[Spanish Sahara]] during the [[Ifni War]] (known as the \"Forgotten War\" in Spain). Only in 1975, with the [[Green March]], did Morocco take control of all of the former Spanish territories in the Sahara.\n\nIn 1968, under pressure from the [[United Nations]],<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Campos|first1=Alicia|title=The Decolonization of Equatorial Guinea: The Relevance of the International Factor|journal=The Journal of African History|date=2003|volume=44|issue=1|pages=95\u2013116|doi=10.1017/s0021853702008319}}</ref> Franco granted Spain's colony of [[Equatorial Guinea]] its independence, and the next year it ceded the [[exclave]] of [[Ifni]] to [[Morocco]]. Under Franco, Spain also pursued a campaign to force a negotiation on the [[British overseas territory]] of [[Gibraltar]], and [[Disputed status of Gibraltar|closed its border with that territory]] in 1969. The border would not be fully reopened until 1985.\n\n=== Economic policy ===\n{{See also|Economic history of Spain#The Franco Era, 1939-75|l1=Economic history of Spain: Economy under Franco}}\nThe Civil War ravaged the Spanish economy.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Collier|first1=Paul|title=On the economic consequences of civil war|journal=Oxford Economic Papers |volume=51|date=1999|pages=168\u2013183|doi=10.1093/oep/51.1.168|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5808497fa94e6896ad350d122c578ef431528b7e}}</ref> Infrastructure had been damaged, workers killed, and daily business severely hampered. For more than a decade after Franco's victory, the devastated economy recovered very slowly. Franco initially pursued a policy of [[autarky]], cutting off almost all international trade. The policy had devastating effects, and the economy stagnated. Only black marketeers could enjoy an evident affluence.\n\n[[File:Spanish peseta coin with Franco 1963.gif|thumb|left|1963 [[Spanish peseta]] coin with an image of Franco and lettering reading: \"Francisco Franco, Leader of Spain, by the grace of God\"]]\nOn the brink of bankruptcy, a combination of pressure from the [[United States]], the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], managed to convince the regime to adopt a free market economy. Many of the old guard in charge of the economy were replaced by \"technocrata\", despite some initial opposition from Franco. From the mid-1950s there was modest acceleration in economic activity after some minor reforms and a relaxation of controls. But the growth proved too much for the economy, with shortages and inflation breaking out towards the end of the 1950s.\n\nWhen Franco replaced his ideological ministers with the apolitical technocrats, the regime implemented several development policies that included deep economic reforms. After a recession, growth took off from 1959, creating an economic boom that lasted until 1974, and became known as the \"[[Spanish Miracle]]\".\n\nConcurrent with the absence of social reforms, and the economic power shift, a tide of mass emigration commenced to other European countries, and to a lesser extent, to South America. Emigration helped the regime in two ways. The country got rid of populations it would not have been able to keep in employment, and the emigrants supplied the country with much needed monetary remittances.\n\nDuring the 1960s, the wealthy classes of Francoist Spain experienced further increases in wealth, particularly those who remained politically faithful, while a burgeoning middle class became visible as the \"economic miracle\" progressed. International firms established factories in Spain where salaries were low, company taxes very low, strikes forbidden and workers' health or state protections almost unheard of. State-owned firms like the car manufacturer [[SEAT]], truck builder [[Pegaso]] and oil refiner INH, massively expanded production. Furthermore, Spain was virtually a new mass market. Spain became the second-fastest growing economy in the world between 1959 and 1973, just behind Japan. By the time of Franco's death in 1975, Spain still lagged behind most of Western Europe but the gap between its per capita GDP and that of the leading Western European countries had narrowed greatly, and the country had developed a large industrialised economy.\n\n=== Regions ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}\n[[File:Visita de Francisco Franco a la localidad de Tolosa (5 de 21) - Fondo Car-Kutxa Fototeka.jpg|thumb|Franco's visit to [[Tolosa, Spain|Tolosa]] in 1948]]\nFranco was reluctant to enact any form of administrative and legislative decentralisation and kept a fully centralised government with a similar administrative structure to that established by the [[House of Bourbon]] and General [[Miguel Primo de Rivera y Orbaneja]]. Such structures were based on the model of the French centralised state. The main drawback of this kind of management was that government attention and initiatives were irregular, and often depended more on the goodwill of regional government representatives than on regional needs. Thus, inequalities in schooling, health care and transport facilities among regions were patent: classically affluent regions like Madrid, Catalonia, or the Basque Country fared much better than Extremadura, Galicia or Andalusia. Some regions, like Extremadura or La Mancha did not have a university.\n\nThe Basque Country and Catalonia were among the regions that offered the strongest resistance to Franco in the Civil War{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}. Franco dissolved the autonomy granted by the [[Second Spanish Republic]] to these two regions and to [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]. Franco abolished the centuries-old{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}} fiscal privileges and autonomy (the ''[[fueros]]'') of two of the three Basque provinces: [[Guipuzcoa]] and [[Biscay]], but kept them for [[\u00c1lava]] which had sided with the nationalists in the civil war.\n\nFranco also decided to preserve [[Navarre]]'s centuries old fiscal privileges and autonomy, the so-called [[Fueros of Navarre]]. Navarre, the northern half of which was Basque-speaking, was one of Franco's areas of greatest support during the civil war. The regional privileges for \u00c1lava and Navarre were kept because they had participated in the initial ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' against the Republican government on 18 July 1936.\n\nFranco abolished the official statute and recognition of the [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Galician language|Galician]], and [[Catalan language]]s that the [[Second Spanish Republic]] had granted for the first time in the history of Spain. He returned to Castilian as the only official language of the state and education. The Franco era saw the popularisation of the compulsory national educational system and the development of modern mass media, both controlled by the state and both using the Castilian language, which significantly reduced the number of speakers of Basque, Catalan and Galician, as happened during the second half of the 20th century with other European minority languages which were not officially protected, such as [[Scottish Gaelic]] or French [[Breton language|Breton]]. By the 1970s the majority of the population in urban areas could not speak the [[minority language]] or, as in some Catalan towns, their social use had been abandoned, leaving them limited to family use.\n\nBecause of the already fragile situation of the Basque language before the Civil War, it became the most endangered language in Spain{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}. By the 1970s Basque lacked a sufficient number of new speakers to assure its future, and moved closer to extinction. It is now recognised that the Basque language would have disappeared in a few more decades if the same linguistic policies had been preserved. This was the main reason that drove the Francoist provincial government of [[\u00c1lava]] to create a network of Basque medium schools ([[Ikastola]]) in 1973 which were state-financed.\n\n== Succession ==\n[[File:In Madrid is herdacht dat Franco 30 jaar geleden de burgeroorlog ( 1936 1939 ) w, Bestanddeelnr 922-4913 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Franco with Prince Juan Carlos in 1969]]\nFranco decided to name a monarch to succeed his regency but the simmering tensions between the [[Carlists]] and the Alfonsoists continued. In a bid to avoid a repeat of the [[Carlist Wars]], he offered the throne to the [[Habsburg]] Archduke [[Otto von Habsburg]]; by doing so he believed that he could eliminate the question of a [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] succession entirely since the Habsburg family which had ruled the [[Habsburg Spain]] during its golden age had an alternate claim to the Spanish throne before the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]. Archduke Otto declined, stating that he would be seen as a [[Germans|German]] ruling Spain and could never forget his [[Austrians|Austrian]] identity. In 1969 Franco nominated as his heir-apparent Prince [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos de Borb\u00f3n]], who had been educated by him in Spain, with the new title of Prince of Spain. This designation came as a surprise to the [[Carlism|Carlist]] pretender to the throne, as well as to Juan Carlos's father, [[Juan de Borb\u00f3n|Don Juan, the Count of Barcelona]], who had a superior claim to the throne, but whom Franco feared to be too liberal.\n\nHowever, when Juan Carlos asked Franco if he could sit in on cabinet meetings, Franco would not permit him saying; \"You would do things differently.\"<ref>Conversation between David Brightly (Ambassador to Spain 1994\u20131998) and John Holroyd-Doveton</ref> Due to the spread of democracy excluding the Soviet block in Europe since the Second World War, Juan Carlos could or would not have been a dictator in the way Franco had been.\n\nBy 1973 Franco had surrendered the function of prime minister (''Presidente del Gobierno''), remaining only as head of state and commander in chief of the military.\n\nAs his final years progressed, tensions within the various factions of the ''Movimiento'' would consume Spanish political life, as varying groups jockeyed for position in an effort to win control of the country's future. The [[assassination]] of prime minister [[Luis Carrero Blanco]] in the [[Assassination of Luis Carrero Blanco|20 December 1973 bombing]] by [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] eventually gave an edge to the liberalizing faction.\n\n== Death and funeral ==\n[[File:Carlos Arias Navarro and Franco 1975.jpg|right|thumb|[[Carlos Arias Navarro]] and Franco at his residence in October 1975, around one week before he fell into an irreversible coma]]\nOn 19 July 1974, the aged Franco fell ill from various health problems, and Juan Carlos took over as acting head of state. Franco soon recovered and on 2 September he resumed his duties as head of state. A year later he fell ill again, afflicted with further health issues, including a long battle with [[Parkinson's disease]].

(Fenaroli Partimento No. 1, Book 1, Gj1301)]]\n[[File:Fenaroli Partimento Fugue 8, Book 5, Gj1418.jpg|thumb|right|500px| A partimenti fugue for more advanced students. As students progressed, partimenti became unfigured.(Fenaroli Partimento Fugue 8, Book 5, Gj1418)]]\n\nA '''Partimento''' (from the [[Italian language|Italian]]: partimento, plural partimenti) is a sketch (often a bass line), written out on a single staff, whose main purpose is to be a guide for the improvisation (\"realization\") of a composition at the keyboard.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=14}}\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Durante.jpg|thumb|Francesco Durante]]\n[[File:Leonardo Leo.jpg|thumb|Leonardo Leo]]\n\n=== Beginnings ===\nThe Partimenti evolved in the late 17th century in educational milieus in Bologna, Rome, and Naples. Many important Italian composers emerged from the musical institutions in Naples, Bologna, and Milano, such as [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]], [[Domenico Cimarosa]], [[Vincenzo Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti]], [[Gaspare Spontini]] and [[Gioachino Rossini]].\n\n=== Golden Age ===\nThe golden age of partimento was presided over by [[Francesco Durante|Francesco Durante]] and [[Leonardo Leo|Leonardo Leo]], the 2nd generation of Neapolitan masters.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=67}}\n\n=== Influence on Paris Conservatory ===\n\n=== Decline and Disappearance ===\n\n=== Revival ===\nThe rediscovery of the partimento tradition in modern research since around 2000 has enabled new ways of looking at the musical education and composing practice in the 18th and 19th centuries. Today, partimento studies provide an important impetus for a more integrative approach to learning counterpoint, harmony, and improvisation.\n\n== Pedagogical Characteristics ==\nPartimenti were typically used as exercises to train conventional models of [[voice leading]], [[harmony]], and musical form, such as the so-called [[Rule of the octave|Rule of the Octave]] (the harmonized scale), [[Cadence (music)|cadences]] and [[Sequence (music)|sequences]] (the movimenti, or moti del basso). The beginners\u2019 partimenti treatises usually present rules, which are then followed by exercises of increasing difficulty, presenting [[figured bass]]  as well as [[unfigured bass]] lines, and culminating in the advanced exercises of imitative partimenti and partimento [[fugue|fugues]].\n\n=== Harmony vs Counterpoint ===\nThere is no strict separation between [[counterpoint]] and harmony in the Partimento tradition.\n\n== Consonance and Dissonance ==\nMusic is composed of consonances and dissonances.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=2}}\n\n=== Consonances ===\nThe four consonances are the 3rd, 5th, 6th and 8th. The 5th and 8th are perfect consonances because one cannot make distinctions between them by expanding them with a sharp or diminishing them with a flat. The 3rd and 6th are considered imperfect consonances because one can make distinctions between them.\n\n=== Dissonances ===\nThe four dissonances are the 2nd, 4th, 7th and 9th. These cannot be used unless prepared by a preceding consonance and subsequently resolved to one of the aforementioned consonances.\n\n== Cadences ==\nThere are three cadences: Simple, Compound and Double. They are made with the scale degrees in the bass, \u2460 and \u2464.\n\n=== Simple Cadence ===\nA simple cadence is when one gives the bass the simple consonances required by both \u2460 and \u2464. That is, the \u2460 takes the 3rd and 5th, and the \u2464 takes the major 3rd and 5th.\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n    {\n      \\new PianoStaff <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n

(Fenaroli Partimento Fugue 8, Book 5, Gj1418)]]\n\nA '''Partimento''' (from the [[Italian language|Italian]]: partimento, plural partimenti) is a sketch (often a bass line), written out on a single staff, whose main purpose is to be a guide for the improvisation (\"realization\") of a composition at the keyboard.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=14}}\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Durante.jpg|thumb|Francesco Durante]]\n[[File:Leonardo Leo.jpg|thumb|Leonardo Leo]]\n\n=== Beginnings ===\nThe Partimenti evolved in the late 17th century in educational milieus in Bologna, Rome, and Naples. Many important Italian composers emerged from the musical institutions in Naples, Bologna, and Milano, such as [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]], [[Domenico Cimarosa]], [[Vincenzo Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti]], [[Gaspare Spontini]] and [[Gioachino Rossini]].\n\n=== Golden Age ===\nThe golden age of partimento was presided over by [[Francesco Durante|Francesco Durante]] and [[Leonardo Leo|Leonardo Leo]], the 2nd generation of Neapolitan masters.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=67}}\n\n=== Influence on Paris Conservatory ===\n\n=== Decline and Disappearance ===\n\n=== Revival ===\nThe rediscovery of the partimento tradition in modern research since around 2000 has enabled new ways of looking at the musical education and composing practice in the 18th and 19th centuries. Today, partimento studies provide an important impetus for a more integrative approach to learning counterpoint, harmony, and improvisation.\n\n== Pedagogical Characteristics ==\nPartimenti were typically used as exercises to train conventional models of [[voice leading]], [[harmony]], and musical form, such as the so-called [[Rule of the octave|Rule of the Octave]] (the harmonized scale), [[Cadence (music)|cadences]] and [[Sequence (music)|sequences]] (the movimenti, or moti del basso). The beginners\u2019 partimenti treatises usually present rules, which are then followed by exercises of increasing difficulty, presenting [[figured bass]]  as well as [[unfigured bass]] lines, and culminating in the advanced exercises of imitative partimenti and partimento [[fugue|fugues]].\n\n=== Harmony vs Counterpoint ===\nThere is no strict separation between [[counterpoint]] and harmony in the Partimento tradition.\n\n== Consonance and Dissonance ==\nMusic is composed of consonances and dissonances.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=2}}\n\n=== Consonances ===\nThe four consonances are the 3rd, 5th, 6th and 8th. The 5th and 8th are perfect consonances because one cannot make distinctions between them by expanding them with a sharp or diminishing them with a flat. The 3rd and 6th are considered imperfect consonances because one can make distinctions between them.\n\n=== Dissonances ===\nThe four dissonances are the 2nd, 4th, 7th and 9th. These cannot be used unless prepared by a preceding consonance and subsequently resolved to one of the aforementioned consonances.\n\n== Cadences ==\nThere are three cadences: Simple, Compound and Double. They are made with the scale degrees in the bass, \u2460 and \u2464.\n\n=== Simple Cadence ===\nA simple cadence is when one gives the bass the simple consonances required by both \u2460 and \u2464. That is, the \u2460 takes the 3rd and 5th, and the \u2464 takes the major 3rd and 5th.\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n    {\n      \\new PianoStaff <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n
