It is located {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} north of [[Seattle]] and is one of the main cities in the [[Seattle metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] and [[Puget Sound region]]. Everett is the [[List of cities and towns in Washington|seventh-largest]] city in Washington state and had a total population of 103,019 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The city is located at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]] along [[Port Gardner Bay]], an inlet of [[Possession Sound]] (itself part of [[Puget Sound]]).\n\nAmerican settlement on the Everett peninsula began in the 1860s, with several [[sawmill]]s built to serve the area's growing timber industry. Everett was [[plat]]ted by a group of investors seeking to build an industrial city and named for the son of co-founder Charles L. Colby. The city was [[municipal incorporation|incorporated]] in 1893, shortly after the arrival of the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]], and prospered as a major industrial center. Everett's economy transitioned away from lumber and towards aviation after [[World War II]], with the construction of [[Boeing]]'s [[Boeing Everett Factory|aircraft assembly plant]] at [[Paine Field]] in 1967. Boeing remains the city's largest employer, alongside the [[U.S. Navy]], which has operated [[Naval Station Everett]] since 1992. Everett received an [[All-America City Award]] in 2002.\n\nEverett remains a major employment center for Snohomish County, but has also become a [[bedroom community]] for Seattle in recent decades. It is connected to Seattle by [[Interstate 5 in Washington|Interstate 5]] and various public transit services at [[Everett Station]], including the [[Sounder commuter rail|Sounder commuter train]], [[Amtrak]], and commuter buses.\n\n==History==\n[[File:everettwaterfront.jpg|thumb| [[Weyerhaeuser]] Lumber Mill, Everett Waterfront, c. early 1900s]]\n\nThe [[Port Gardner]] peninsula was originally inhabited by local [[Coast Salish]] tribes who arrived in the region 10,000 years [[before present]] and settled near modern-day Everett approximately 2,000 years [[before present]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}} The [[Snohomish people]] lived around local waterways in the [[Possession Sound]] estuary and had a fortified winter village at Hibulb (also called Hebolb) at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}}<ref>{{cite news |last=Whitely |first=Peyton |date=March 16, 2005 |title=Aerial photos show 2 very different cities |page=H8 |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/aerial-photos-show-2-very-different-cities/ |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The first Europeans in the area were explorers from the 1792 [[Vancouver Expedition]], landing on a beach on the modern Everett waterfront on June 4 and claiming the land for [[England]] on the birthday of King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]].<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Federal Writers' Project]] |year=1941 |title=The WPA Guide to Washington: The Evergreen State |pages=186\u2013200 |series=[[American Guide Series]] |publisher=[[Works Progress Administration]] |oclc=881468746 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=07PpCAAAQBAJ |via=Google Books |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> [[Puget Sound]] was further explored and charted ny the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in 1824 and the [[United States Exploring Expedition]] under [[Charles Wilkes]] in 1841, ahead of a larger American presence in the area.{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=4}}<ref name=\"HistoryLink\">{{cite web |last=Oakley |first=Janet |date=July 26, 2005 |title=Everett \u2014 Thumbnail History |url=https://www.historylink.org/file/7397 |work=[[HistoryLink]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Snohomish and other Coast Salish tribes signed the [[Treaty of Point Elliott]] in 1855, which relinquished their lands to the [[Washington Territory|territorial government]] and established the nearby [[Tulalip Indian Reservation]], where they would be relocated.<ref name=\"Herald-125th\">{{cite news |last=Muhlstein |first=Julie |date=May 9, 2018 |title=City of Everett to celebrate 125th birthday with big party |url=https://www.heraldnet.com/news/city-of-everett-celebrates-125-years-and-counting/ |work=[[The Everett Herald]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The first permanent American settler to arrive on the peninsula was Dennis Brigham, a carpenter from [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], who claimed a {{convert|160|acre|km2|1|adj=on}} [[Homestead Acts|homestead]] and built a cabin for himself.

Hill]], and turn it into a \"[[Pittsburgh]] of the West\".{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=12}}<ref name=\"Times-HewittColby93\">{{cite news |last=Dilgard |first=David |date=April 22, 1993 |title=Odd couple of Hewitt and Colby hatched ambitious plan for Everett |page=F5 |url=https://archive.seattletimes.com/archive/?date=19930422&slug=1697251 |work=The Seattle Times |accessdate=April 3, 2020}}</ref> On August 22, 1890, the [[plat]] for a {{convert|50|acre|m2|adj=on}} townsite on the peninsula was filed by the [[Rucker Brothers]], who had moved north from Tacoma and had more modest plans for the area.{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=12}}\n\nBy September, Colby had secured $800,000 in funding from oil magnate [[John D. Rockefeller]] and his railroad associate [[Colgate Hoyt]] to begin acquiring land while avoiding property speculators.{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=12}} The Hewitt\u2013Colby syndicate decided to use a name without an identifiable location, naming their planned city after [[Everett Colby]], the fifteen-year-old son of investor Charles L. Colby, who had displayed a \"prodigious appetite\" at a group dinner.<ref name=\"Times-HewittColby93\"/> The Everett Land Company was incorporated in [[Pierce County, Washington|Pierce County]] on November 19, 1890, and acquired {{convert|434.15|acre|sqkm}} of property from the Rucker Brothers a week later.{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=15}} The Rucker plat was withdrawn after an agreement was reached with Hewitt promising certain industrial developments under the \"Remarkable Document\", which was also used to acquire property from other landowners in the area.{{sfnp|Cameron|LeWarne|May|O'Donnell|2005|p=103}}\n\nEverett gained its first businesses in early 1891, as the new settlement attracted land speculators and commitments to build lumber mills and other industrial enterprises.{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=16}} The Everett Land Company bought much of the Ruckers' land, taking them in as junior partners. Everett was officially incorporated on May 4, 1893, the year the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]] came to the town. Both Hewitt and the Ruckers had speculated that [[James J. Hill]] would make the town the terminus of his railroad. However Hill continued the railroad along the shore of [[Puget Sound]] to [[Seattle]]. Although it succeeded in building the city, the Everett Land Company was a failure for its investors. The outside investors withdrew, and the Company's holdings were transferred to a new company controlled by Hill. The Ruckers, who helped broker the deal, stayed in Everett and became leading citizens of the young city.\n\nRailroads and mines played a part in Everett's future. The mining community of [[Monte Cristo, Washington|Monte Cristo]] depended on a railway for supplies. It was hoped that the railroad would cross the mountains and bring in traffic. For a while ore was smelted in Everett, then sawmilling and port activity commenced. A dozen steam riverboats were built in Everett for the [[Klondike Gold Rush|Yukon gold rush]].\n\nSeveral survivors of the [[Bellingham riots]] settled in Everett for two months, until they were beaten and forcefully evicted by a mob on November 5, 1907. Everett also was the site of the [[Everett Massacre]] of 1916 in which a posse led by local Sheriff Donald McRae shot and killed five [[Industrial Workers of the World]] members. The IWW members on the [[Verona (steamship)|steamer ''Verona'']] travelled from Seattle to support strikers in Everett and sought to land, but McRae and his posse of deputized civilians blocked the harbor. Shooting broke out and at least five IWW members were killed, along with two in the posse who were deemed to have been killed by friendly fire.\n\nEverett streets are named after each of the three founders. Adjacent streets Colby Avenue and Hoyt Avenue run north and south and are intersected by Hewitt Avenue running east and west just south of the [[BNSF Railway]] tracks cutting across Everett. There are several other streets named for their associates such as Bond Street named for Judge [[Hiram Bond]], President of the Everett & Monte Cristo Railroad. Parallel to Colby and Hoyt are avenues named for other investors, [[John D. Rockefeller]], railroad executive [[Thomas Fletcher Oakes|T.F. Oakes]], shipbuilder [[Alexander McDougall (1845-1923)|Alexander McDougall]], and McDougall's associate [[Charles W. Wetmore]].\n\nDuring the [[Great Depression]], the [[Works Progress Administration]] was tasked with construction of several public works projects in the Everett area, including a new county airport that later became [[Paine Field]]. The airport was appropriated for military use during [[World War II]], but was later turned over to county ownership.<ref name=\"HistoryLink\"/> The [[Boeing Company]] selected a {{convert|780|acre|ha|adj=mid}} plot of land north of the airport in June 1966 to build a [[Boeing Everett Factory|new airplane factory]] for its [[Boeing 747]] passenger jetliner, which would become the world's first \"jumbo jet\".

It is located {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} north of [[Seattle]] and is one of the main cities in the [[Seattle metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] and [[Puget Sound region]]. Everett is the [[List of cities and towns in Washington|seventh-largest]] city in Washington state and had a total population of 103,019 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The city is located at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]] along [[Port Gardner Bay]], an inlet of [[Possession Sound]] (itself part of [[Puget Sound]]).\n\nAmerican settlement on the Everett peninsula began in the 1860s, with several [[sawmill]]s built to serve the area's growing timber industry. Everett was [[plat]]ted by a group of investors seeking to build an industrial city and named for the son of co-founder Charles L. Colby. The city was [[municipal incorporation|incorporated]] in 1893, shortly after the arrival of the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]], and prospered as a major industrial center. Everett's economy transitioned away from lumber and towards aviation after [[World War II]], with the construction of [[Boeing]]'s [[Boeing Everett Factory|aircraft assembly plant]] at [[Paine Field]] in 1967. Boeing remains the city's largest employer, alongside the [[U.S. Navy]], which has operated [[Naval Station Everett]] since 1992. Everett received an [[All-America City Award]] in 2002.\n\nEverett remains a major employment center for Snohomish County, but has also become a [[bedroom community]] for Seattle in recent decades. It is connected to Seattle by [[Interstate 5 in Washington|Interstate 5]] and various public transit services at [[Everett Station]], including the [[Sounder commuter rail|Sounder commuter train]], [[Amtrak]], and commuter buses.\n\n==History==\n[[File:everettwaterfront.jpg|thumb| [[Weyerhaeuser]] Lumber Mill, Everett Waterfront, c. early 1900s]]\n\nThe [[Port Gardner]] peninsula was originally inhabited by local [[Coast Salish]] tribes who arrived in the region 10,000 years [[before present]] and settled near modern-day Everett approximately 2,000 years [[before present]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}} The [[Snohomish people]] lived around local waterways in the [[Possession Sound]] estuary and had a fortified winter village at Hibulb (also called Hebolb) at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}}<ref>{{cite news |last=Whitely |first=Peyton |date=March 16, 2005 |title=Aerial photos show 2 very different cities |page=H8 |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/aerial-photos-show-2-very-different-cities/ |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The first Europeans in the area were explorers from the 1792 [[Vancouver Expedition]], landing on a beach on the modern Everett waterfront on June 4 and claiming the land for [[England]] on the birthday of King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]].<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Federal Writers' Project]] |year=1941 |title=The WPA Guide to Washington: The Evergreen State |pages=186\u2013200 |series=[[American Guide Series]] |publisher=[[Works Progress Administration]] |oclc=881468746 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=07PpCAAAQBAJ |via=Google Books |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> [[Puget Sound]] was further explored and charted ny the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in 1824 and the [[United States Exploring Expedition]] under [[Charles Wilkes]] in 1841, ahead of a larger American presence in the area.{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=4}}<ref name=\"HistoryLink\">{{cite web |last=Oakley |first=Janet |date=July 26, 2005 |title=Everett \u2014 Thumbnail History |url=https://www.historylink.org/file/7397 |work=[[HistoryLink]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Snohomish and other Coast Salish tribes signed the [[Treaty of Point Elliott]] in 1855, which relinquished their lands to the [[Washington Territory|territorial government]] and established the nearby [[Tulalip Indian Reservation]], where they would be relocated.<ref name=\"Herald-125th\">{{cite news |last=Muhlstein |first=Julie |date=May 9, 2018 |title=City of Everett to celebrate 125th birthday with big party |url=https://www.heraldnet.com/news/city-of-everett-celebrates-125-years-and-counting/ |work=[[The Everett Herald]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The first permanent American settler to arrive on the peninsula was Dennis Brigham, a carpenter from [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], who claimed a {{convert|160|acre|km2|1|adj=on}} [[Homestead Acts|homestead]] and built a cabin for himself. He was joined by several other families on their own homesteads, which included the establishment of a general store and a [[sawmill]] that quickly went out of business.<ref name=\"HistoryLink\"/> Over the next several years a handful of loggers moved to the area, but plans for a settlement were not conceived until 1890.{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=7}}\n\nDuring an Alaskan cruise via the [[Inside Passage]] aboard the steamship ''[[Queen of the Pacific]]'' in July 1890, plans were drawn up for an industrial city on Port Gardner Bay by lumberman [[Henry Hewitt Jr.]] and railroad executive [[Charles L. Colby]]. Hewitt and Colby had previously met in [[Wisconsin]], where they operated lumber and maritime businesses, respectively, and in [[Tacoma, Washington]], from which the voyage began. The pair sought to build an industrial center at a site they speculated would be the first ocean port for [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]], to be constructed by [[James J. Hill]], and turn it into a \"[[Pittsburgh]] of the West\".{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=12}}<ref name=\"Times-HewittColby93\">{{cite news |last=Dilgard |first=David |date=April 22, 1993 |title=Odd couple of Hewitt and Colby hatched ambitious plan for Everett |page=F5 |url=https://archive.seattletimes.com/archive/?date=19930422&slug=1697251 |work=The Seattle Times |accessdate=April 3, 2020}}</ref> On August 22, 1890, the [[plat]] for a {{convert|50|acre|m2|adj=on}} townsite on the peninsula was filed by the [[Rucker Brothers]], who had moved north from Tacoma and had more modest plans for the area.{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=12}}\n\nBy September, Colby had secured $800,000 in funding from oil magnate [[John D. Rockefeller]] and his railroad associate [[Colgate Hoyt]] to begin acquiring land while avoiding property speculators.{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=12}} The Hewitt\u2013Colby syndicate decided to use a name without an identifiable location, naming their planned city after [[Everett Colby]], the fifteen-year-old son of investor Charles L. Colby, who had displayed a \"prodigious appetite\" at a group dinner.<ref name=\"Times-HewittColby93\"/> The Everett Land Company was incorporated in [[Pierce County, Washington|Pierce County]] on November 19, 1890, and acquired {{convert|434.15|acre|sqkm}} of property from the Rucker Brothers a week later.{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=15}} The Rucker plat was withdrawn after an agreement was reached with Hewitt promising certain industrial developments under the \"Remarkable Document\", which was also used to acquire property from other landowners in the area.{{sfnp|Cameron|LeWarne|May|O'Donnell|2005|p=103}}\n\nThe Company bought much of the Ruckers' land, taking them in as junior partners. Everett was officially incorporated on May 4, 1893, the year the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]] came to the town. Both Hewitt and the Ruckers had speculated that [[James J. Hill]] would make the town the terminus of his railroad. However Hill continued the railroad along the shore of [[Puget Sound]] to [[Seattle]]. Although it succeeded in building the city, the Everett Land Company was a failure for its investors. The outside investors withdrew, and the Company's holdings were transferred to a new company controlled by Hill. The Ruckers, who helped broker the deal, stayed in Everett and became leading citizens of the young city.\n\nRailroads and mines played a part in Everett's future. The mining community of [[Monte Cristo, Washington|Monte Cristo]] depended on a railway for supplies. It was hoped that the railroad would cross the mountains and bring in traffic. For a while ore was smelted in Everett, then sawmilling and port activity commenced. A dozen steam riverboats were built in Everett for the [[Klondike Gold Rush|Yukon gold rush]].\n\nSeveral survivors of the [[Bellingham riots]] settled in Everett for two months, until they were beaten and forcefully evicted by a mob on November 5, 1907. Everett also was the site of the [[Everett Massacre]] of 1916 in which a posse led by local Sheriff Donald McRae shot and killed five [[Industrial Workers of the World]] members. The IWW members on the [[Verona (steamship)|steamer ''Verona'']] travelled from Seattle to support strikers in Everett and sought to land, but McRae and his posse of deputized civilians blocked the harbor. Shooting broke out and at least five IWW members were killed, along with two in the posse who were deemed to have been killed by friendly fire.\n\nEverett streets are named after each of the three founders. Adjacent streets Colby Avenue and Hoyt Avenue run north and south and are intersected by Hewitt Avenue running east and west just south of the [[BNSF Railway]] tracks cutting across Everett. There are several other streets named for their associates such as Bond Street named for Judge [[Hiram Bond]], President of the Everett & Monte Cristo Railroad. Parallel to Colby and Hoyt are avenues named for other investors, [[John D. Rockefeller]], railroad executive [[Thomas Fletcher Oakes|T.F. Oakes]], shipbuilder [[Alexander McDougall (1845-1923)|Alexander McDougall]], and McDougall's associate [[Charles W.

The ACB was established in 1970 and was once part of the '''Office of Film and Literature Classification''' ('''OFLC'''), which was dissolved in 2006. The Department of Communications and the Arts now provides administrative support to the ACB and decisions made by the ACB may be reviewed by the [[Australian Classification Review Board]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.classification.gov.au/About/Pages/Review-Board.aspx|title=Review Board {{!}} Australian Classification|website=www.classification.gov.au|access-date=2016-04-30}}</ref> The ACB now operates under the ''Commonwealth Classification Act 1995''.\n\nThe ACB does not directly censor material by ordering cuts or changes. However, it is able to effectively censor media by refusing classification and making the media illegal for hire, exhibition and importation to Australia. \n\nThe classification system has several levels of \"restricted\" categories, prohibiting sale, exhibition or use of some materials to those who are under a prescribed age. In 2005, video and computer games became subject to the same classification ratings and restrictions as films (with the exception of the R18+ and X18+ ratings), in response to confusion by parents.<ref>{{Cite news|edition=1 \u2013 State |page=11 |title=Games get film ratings |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=6 July 2005 |url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,10117,15534581-421,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050609030406/http://www.news.com.au/story/0%2C10117%2C15534581-421%2C00.html |archivedate=9 June 2005 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Despite a line in the ''National Classification Code'' stating that \"adults should be able to read, hear and see what they want\", the adult R18+ classification was not applied to video games in Australia until 1 January 2013.<ref>[http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/F2013C00006 The Classification Code; May 2005]</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe Australian Classification Board was created in 1970 to classify or rate all films (and later in 1994, [[video games]]) that came into Australia. In the early years of the system, beginning in November 1971, there were four ratings:\n\n*''G'' for \"general exhibition\", carried over from the previous ratings system\n*''NRC'' for \"not recommended for children under 12\" (previously ''X, A'' or ''not suitable for children.'' This later became ''PG'' for \"parental guidance\")\n*''M'' for \"mature audiences\" (later became ''M 15+'' from the late 1980s until 2005)\n*''R'' for \"restricted exhibition\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uLIpAAAAIBAJ&sjid=JuUDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4106,478776&dq=fritz+the+cat&hl=en|title=Censorship Classifications|date=1 July 1973|accessdate=18 September 2010|work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|page=87}}</ref> (previously ''SOA'' or ''suitable only for adults''.  This later became ''R 18+'' in the late 1980s)\n\nThe ''MA 15+'' rating was introduced in 1993, to flag content that was too strong for the ''M'' classification, but not so much so that the content should be restricted only to persons over the age of 18.<ref>Cole, R., Driscoll, C., & Grealy, L. (2018). Classifying adulthood: A history of governing minority in media classi\ufb01cation. In Youth, Technology, Governance, Experience (p. 74). Routledge.</ref>\n\nThe Office of Film and Literature Classification (OFLC) was reorganised in 1994, and oversaw the ACB. In 2005 the OFLC was dissolved and supervision of the ACB transferred to the [[Attorney-General's Department (Australia)|Attorney-General's Department]].\n\nThe current colour-coded classification markings for films and computer games were introduced in May 2005.<ref>[http://www.classification.gov.au/About/AnnualReports/Documents/673.pdf Annual Report 2004\u20132005]</ref>\n\nIn August 2014, the ACB introduced amendments to allow for the automated classification process employed by the [[International Age Rating Coalition]]. This new process reduces the costs of video game developers as they seek to obtain ratings for their products that are distributed digitally online.<ref>http://au.ign.com/articles/2014/09/01/getting-digitally-distributed-games-classified-in-australia-to-be-cost-free</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nThe board operates on a procedure that primarily involves [[decision-making]]. The members must communicate their views clearly and appreciate the views of others. Board members would be exposed to a wide range of material, including content that is confronting and offensive. Every film and computer game has to be classified before it can be legally made available to the public. Some [[publications]] also need to be classified. Failure to give classification (especially for unclassified material that is likely to be classified RC) is an implicit [[ban (law)|ban]] (except for exempt films, games, and publications). It is an offence \"to display, demonstrate, sell, hire, publicly exhibit or advertise a film or computer game\" without having it classified. Some films and documentaries (such as [[current affairs (news format)|current affairs]] and those created for business, scientific and [[Video lesson|education]] purposes) are exempt from classification unless, if classified, they would be ''M'' or above.<ref>http://www.artslaw.com.au/info-sheets/info-sheet/classification-and-censorship/</ref>\n\nThere are legal age restrictions for the ratings of ''MA 15+'' and ''R 18+''. ''X 18+'' is a special restriction rating for adult content. The other classification categories (''G'', ''PG'' and ''M'') are merely recommendations and they are not submitted to legal age restrictions. ''RC'' (banned) material cannot be sold, hired or distributed to any persons. A film or video game's context is crucial in determining whether a classifiable element is justified by the story-line or themes.\n\nThe ACB decides what consumer advice accompanies each classification. They indicate the elements in films and computer games which caused the classification and help consumers make choices about what they read, view or play. There are six classifiable elements for films: ''themes'' (rape, suicide, racism, etc.), ''violence'' (the level of violence and how threatening it is in its context), ''sex'' (intercourse and references to sex), ''language'' (the level of coarse language), ''drug use'' (the use of, and references to, drugs) and ''nudity'' (the explicitness of nudity). Consumer advice appears with the classification symbol on products, packaging and in advertisements. Consumer advice is not given if the element in question would be acceptable at a lower classification.<ref>http://www.classification.gov.au/Public/Resources/Pages/Parents.aspx</ref>\n\nThe ACB also classifies material submitted by the police, the [[Australian Customs and Border Protection Service]] and the [[Australian Communications and Media Authority]]. The board does not classify live performances, audio CDs and television shows. Television is regulated by the Australian Communications and Media Authority.<ref>{{Cite news | page= 7 | last = Canna | first = Xavier La | title = New classifications pave way for R-rated games |work=The Age |location=Australia | accessdate = 2012-08-05 | date = 6 June 2005 | url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/New-classifications-pave-way-for-Rrated-games/2005/06/05/1117910187614.html }}</ref> Film classification also normally applies to Internet streaming services. In January 2019, for the first time, [[Netflix]] was given the go-ahead to self-regulate film and television classification on its streaming platform, allowing the company to rank content between ''G'' and ''R18+''.<ref>[https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/netflix-gets-approval-to-classify-own-shows-after-two-year-trial-20190120-p50sim.html Netflix gets approval to classify own shows after two-year trial]</ref>\n\n== Film and video game classifications ==\n<!-- PLEASE STOP COMPARING THE RATINGS TO OTHER COUNTRIES' RATING SYSTEMS.-->\n<!-- PLEASE DO NOT LIST THE \"MA15+\" RATING AS \"UNRESTRICTED\".

It is, however, legal to possess ''RC'' films and games for people over 18 (except in [[Western Australia]] and certain parts of the Northern Territory) unless they contain illegal content (such as [[child pornography]]). The content is very high in impact.\n** Films and games that exceed the ''X 18+'' and ''R 18+'' ratings (respectively) are refused classification by the ACB. Content that may be refused classification includes, but is not limited to:\n*** Detailed instruction or promotion in matters of crime or violence.\n*** The promotion or provision of instruction in paedophile activity.\n*** Descriptions or depictions of child sexual abuse or any other exploitative or offensive descriptions or depictions involving a person who is, or appears to be, a child under 18 years.\n*** Gratuitous, exploitative or offensive depictions of:\n****  violence with a very high degree of impact or which are excessively frequent, prolonged or detailed;\n**** ( cruelty or real violence which are very detailed or which have an extremely high impact;\n****  sexual violence.\n*** Depictions of practices such as bestiality, necrophilia or other practices that are considered revolting or abhorrent. \n*** Gratuitous, exploitative or offensive depictions of:\n****  activity accompanied by fetishes or practices that are offensive or abhorrent;\n****  incest fantasies or other fantasies that are offensive or abhorrent.\n\n[[File:Check the Classification Australia.jpg|150px]] \n* ''Check the classification (CTC)'' \u2013 The content has been assessed and approved for advertising unclassified films and computer games. \"This film has advertising approval.

They have content, such as nudity or explicit sexual content, that could offend some sections of the adult community. The ''restricted'' categories are subject to various restrictions in different states; for example, one or both categories may only be sold in adults-only premises in certain states. For this reason, some adult magazines are published in two editions in Australia, or just one edited edition which can be sold anywhere with a warning, as ''unrestricted mature''.\n\n==Controversies==\n\n===Film===\n{{See also|List of films banned in Australia}}\n\n*[[Pasolini]]'s ''[[Sal\u00f2, or the 120 Days of Sodom]]'' has twice been banned in Australia.

The film was banned in 1997, and was released after two failed attempts in September 2010, when the ''ACB'' classified an uncut version of ''Sal\u00f2'' R18+, mainly due to extra material providing greater context.\n*In 1992, Island World Communications Ltd and [[Manga Entertainment]] Australia Ltd had ''[[Urotsukidoji]]: Legend of the Overfiend'' submitted to the ''OFLC''. It was the first animated feature to be banned in Australia and the feature was banned outright, similar to ''[[Violence Jack]]''. ''Urotsukidoji'' was then censored to meet the OFLC's standards. The Australian version is the most censored in the [[western world]]. Many fans of [[anime]] imported uncensored versions of ''Urotsukidoji: Legend of the Overfiend'' from the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. The rest of the ''Urotsukidoji'' series was censored in Australia, with many still importing or downloading the American versions.\n*''[[Ninja Scroll]]'' was originally released in 1994 in Australia by ''Manga Entertainment Ltd''.

The ACB was established in 1970 and was once part of the '''Office of Film and Literature Classification''' ('''OFLC'''), which was dissolved in 2006. The Department of Communications and the Arts now provides administrative support to the ACB and decisions made by the ACB may be reviewed by the [[Australian Classification Review Board]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.classification.gov.au/About/Pages/Review-Board.aspx|title=Review Board {{!}} Australian Classification|website=www.classification.gov.au|access-date=2016-04-30}}</ref> The ACB now operates under the ''Commonwealth Classification Act 1995''.\n\nThe ACB does not directly censor material by ordering cuts or changes. However, it is able to effectively censor media by refusing classification and making the media illegal for hire, exhibition and importation to Australia. \n\nThe classification system has several levels of \"restricted\" categories, prohibiting sale, exhibition or use of some materials to those who are under a prescribed age. In 2005, video and computer games became subject to the same classification ratings and restrictions as films (with the exception of the R18+ and X18+ ratings), in response to confusion by parents.<ref>{{Cite news|edition=1 \u2013 State |page=11 |title=Games get film ratings |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=6 July 2005 |url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,10117,15534581-421,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050609030406/http://www.news.com.au/story/0%2C10117%2C15534581-421%2C00.html |archivedate=9 June 2005 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Despite a line in the ''National Classification Code'' stating that \"adults should be able to read, hear and see what they want\", the adult R18+ classification was not applied to video games in Australia until 1 January 2013.<ref>[http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/F2013C00006 The Classification Code; May 2005]</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe Australian Classification Board was created in 1970 to classify or rate all films (and later in 1994, [[video games]]) that came into Australia. In the early years of the system, beginning in November 1971, there were four ratings:\n\n*''G'' for \"general exhibition\", carried over from the previous ratings system\n*''NRC'' for \"not recommended for children under 12\" (previously ''X, A'' or ''not suitable for children.'' This later became ''PG'' for \"parental guidance\")\n*''M'' for \"mature audiences\" (later became ''M 15+'' from the late 1980s until 2005)\n*''R'' for \"restricted exhibition\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uLIpAAAAIBAJ&sjid=JuUDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4106,478776&dq=fritz+the+cat&hl=en|title=Censorship Classifications|date=1 July 1973|accessdate=18 September 2010|work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|page=87}}</ref> (previously ''SOA'' or ''suitable only for adults''.  This later became ''R 18+'' in the late 1980s)\n\nThe ''MA 15+'' rating was introduced in 1993, to flag content that was too strong for the ''M'' classification, but not so much so that the content should be restricted only to persons over the age of 18.<ref>Cole, R., Driscoll, C., & Grealy, L. (2018). Classifying adulthood: A history of governing minority in media classi\ufb01cation. In Youth, Technology, Governance, Experience (pp. 74). Routledge.</ref>\n\nThe Office of Film and Literature Classification (OFLC) was reorganised in 1994, and oversaw the ACB. In 2005 the OFLC was dissolved and supervision of the ACB transferred to the [[Attorney-General's Department (Australia)|Attorney-General's Department]].\n\nThe current colour-coded classification markings for films and computer games were introduced in May 2005.<ref>[http://www.classification.gov.au/About/AnnualReports/Documents/673.pdf Annual Report 2004\u20132005]</ref>\n\nIn August 2014, the ACB introduced amendments to allow for the automated classification process employed by the [[International Age Rating Coalition]]. This new process reduces the costs of video game developers as they seek to obtain ratings for their products that are distributed digitally online.<ref>http://au.ign.com/articles/2014/09/01/getting-digitally-distributed-games-classified-in-australia-to-be-cost-free</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nThe board operates on a procedure that primarily involves [[decision-making]]. The members must communicate their views clearly and appreciate the views of others. Board members would be exposed to a wide range of material, including content that is confronting and offensive. Every film and computer game has to be classified before it can be legally made available to the public. Some [[publications]] also need to be classified. Failure to give classification (especially for unclassified material that is likely to be classified RC) is an implicit [[ban (law)|ban]] (except for exempt films, games, and publications). It is an offence \"to display, demonstrate, sell, hire, publicly exhibit or advertise a film or computer game\" without having it classified. Some films and documentaries (such as [[current affairs (news format)|current affairs]] and those created for business, scientific and [[Video lesson|education]] purposes) are exempt from classification unless, if classified, they would be ''M'' or above.<ref>http://www.artslaw.com.au/info-sheets/info-sheet/classification-and-censorship/</ref>\n\nThere are legal age restrictions for the ratings of ''MA 15+'' and ''R 18+''. ''X 18+'' is a special restriction rating for adult content. The other classification categories (''G'', ''PG'' and ''M'') are merely recommendations and they are not submitted to legal age restrictions. ''RC'' (banned) material cannot be sold, hired or distributed to any persons. A film or video game's context is crucial in determining whether a classifiable element is justified by the story-line or themes.\n\nThe ACB decides what consumer advice accompanies each classification. They indicate the elements in films and computer games which caused the classification and help consumers make choices about what they read, view or play. There are six classifiable elements for films: ''themes'' (rape, suicide, racism, etc.), ''violence'' (the level of violence and how threatening it is in its context), ''sex'' (intercourse and references to sex), ''language'' (the level of coarse language), ''drug use'' (the use of, and references to, drugs) and ''nudity'' (the explicitness of nudity). Consumer advice appears with the classification symbol on products, packaging and in advertisements. Consumer advice is not given if the element in question would be acceptable at a lower classification.<ref>http://www.classification.gov.au/Public/Resources/Pages/Parents.aspx</ref>\n\nThe ACB also classifies material submitted by the police, the [[Australian Customs and Border Protection Service]] and the [[Australian Communications and Media Authority]]. The board does not classify live performances, audio CDs and television shows. Television is regulated by the Australian Communications and Media Authority.<ref>{{Cite news | page= 7 | last = Canna | first = Xavier La | title = New classifications pave way for R-rated games |work=The Age |location=Australia | accessdate = 2012-08-05 | date = 6 June 2005 | url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/New-classifications-pave-way-for-Rrated-games/2005/06/05/1117910187614.html }}</ref> Film classification also normally applies to Internet streaming services.

Content that may be refused classification includes, but is not limited to:\n*** Detailed instruction or promotion in matters of crime or violence.\n*** The promotion or provision of instruction in paedophile activity.\n*** Descriptions or depictions of child sexual abuse or any other exploitative or offensive descriptions or depictions involving a person who is, or appears to be, a child under 18 years.\n*** Gratuitous, exploitative or offensive depictions of:\n****  violence with a very high degree of impact or which are excessively frequent, prolonged or detailed;\n**** ( cruelty or real violence which are very detailed or which have an extremely high impact;\n****  sexual violence.\n*** Depictions of practices such as bestiality, necrophilia or other practices that are considered revolting or abhorrent. \n*** Gratuitous, exploitative or offensive depictions of:\n****  activity accompanied by fetishes or practices that are offensive or abhorrent;\n****  incest fantasies or other fantasies that are offensive or abhorrent.\n\n[[File:Check the Classification Australia.jpg|150px]] \n* ''Check the classification (CTC)'' \u2013 The content has been assessed and approved for advertising unclassified films and computer games. \"This film has advertising approval.

It is uncommon for these ratings to appear on books, even those dealing with adult themes, except in the most controversial cases.\n\n[[File:OFCL Australia Lit Rating- U.png|Unrestricted]] or [[File:OFCL Australia Lit Rating - UM.png|Unrestricted M (mature)]]\n*''Unrestricted''{{spaced ndash}}These publications are unrestricted, although they may not be recommended for readers under 15 years.\n\n[[File:OFCL Australia Lit Rating - R1.png|Category 1 restricted]]\n*''Category 1 restricted''{{Spaced ndash}}These publications are not available to persons under 18 years.

They have content, such as nudity or explicit sexual content, that could offend some sections of the adult community. The ''restricted'' categories are subject to various restrictions in different states; for example, one or both categories may only be sold in adults-only premises in certain states. For this reason, some adult magazines are published in two editions in Australia, or just one edited edition which can be sold anywhere with a warning, as ''unrestricted mature''.\n\n==Controversies==\n\n===Film===\n{{See also|List of films banned in Australia}}\n\n*[[Pasolini]]'s ''[[Sal\u00f2, or the 120 Days of Sodom]]'' has twice been banned in Australia.

The film was banned in 1997, and was released after two failed attempts in September 2010, when the ''ACB'' classified an uncut version of ''Sal\u00f2'' R18+, mainly due to extra material providing greater context.\n*In 1992, Island World Communications Ltd and [[Manga Entertainment]] Australia Ltd had ''[[Urotsukidoji]]: Legend of the Overfiend'' submitted to the ''OFLC''. It was the first animated feature to be banned in Australia and the feature was banned outright, similar to ''[[Violence Jack]]''. ''Urotsukidoji'' was then censored to meet the OFLC's standards. The Australian version is the most censored in the [[western world]]. Many fans of [[anime]] imported uncensored versions of ''Urotsukidoji: Legend of the Overfiend'' from the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. The rest of the ''Urotsukidoji'' series was censored in Australia, with many still importing or downloading the American versions.\n*''[[Ninja Scroll]]'' was originally released in 1994 in Australia by ''Manga Entertainment Ltd''. It originally had the MA15+ rating on the VHS originally, but this was overturned in 1997 when [[Phillip Ruddock]] had the anime reviewed after an uncut screening of the movie on [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]]. A few months later it was given the R18+ rating and was uncut, then edited again, eventually using the [[BBFC]] cut of it.

The MA15+ rating was re-instated after a modified version was released worldwide by [[Rockstar Games]], removing the content files for the sex scenes.\n*''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'' also prompted editing in the Australian ([[PAL]]) version, as Rockstar was worried it might get a RC rating.

During this period, a [[Roundhead|Parliamentary]] garrison frustrated two attempts to capture the city by [[Cavalier|Royalists]] under [[Ralph Hopton, 1st Baron Hopton|Sir Ralph Hopton]].\n\nAlthough much of the [[West Country]] was strongly Royalist, the ports of [[Exeter]] and [[Plymouth]] were controlled by Parliament, hindering the import of vital military supplies. From October 1642 to January 1643, the Royalists made several efforts to take one of them.\n\nIn the early stages of the war, neither side was equipped or trained for siege warfare, relying on surprise or treachery. When Hopton arrived at Exeter on 18 November, he found it occupied, and withdrew. In late December, he made a more serious attempt, before retreating on 4 January.\n\nFollowing a series of victories in summer 1643, the Royalists captured Exeter on 6 September; it remained in their possession until April 1646.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Ralph Hopton, 1st Baron Hopton of Stratton from NPG.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Royalist commander in the west, [[Ralph Hopton, 1st Baron Hopton|Sir Ralph Hopton]]]]\nWhen the war began in August 1642, [[Roundhead|Parliamentary]] forces secured most of southern England, including the ports of [[Southampton]] and [[Dover]], as well as the bulk of the [[Royal Navy]]. After [[Siege of Portsmouth|capturing Portsmouth]] in September, they controlled every major port from [[Plymouth]] to [[Siege of Hull (1642)|Hull]], hampering Royalist efforts to import arms and men from Europe.{{sfn|Wedgwood|1958|pp=119\u2013120}}\n\nBy the end of September, most of [[Devon]] was held by Parliament, while Royalists under [[Ralph Hopton, 1st Baron Hopton|Sir Ralph Hopton]] secured [[Cornwall]]. In the early stages of the war, most soldiers on both sides were poorly trained and equipped [[Trained bands|militia]]. An exception was Plymouth, where the garrison was commanded by Colonel William Ruthven, and a contingent of experienced Scots mercenaries; their ship stopped to pick up supplies returning from Ireland in early October, and the Parliamentary town council hired them to defend the city.{{sfn|Barratt|2005|pp=35\u201338}}\n\nRuthven easily repulsed attempts to take Plymouth, and in early November Hopton crossed the [[River Tamar]], heading for [[Exeter]], although his troops refused to leave Cornwall until paid in advance. Royalist sympathisers told him it was largely undefended, although the town itself was controlled by supporters of Parliament.{{sfn|Royle|2004|p=235}} Its capture meant control of a vital port on the southern coast, an important export point for Devon wool, and whose position on the [[River Exe]] gave access to internal waterways, vital for transporting bulk supplies.

During this period, a [[Roundhead|Parliamentary]] garrison frustrated two attempts to capture the city by [[Cavalier|Royalists]] under [[Ralph Hopton, 1st Baron Hopton|Sir Ralph Hopton]].\n\nAlthough much of the [[West Country]] was strongly Royalist, the ports of [[Exeter]] and [[Plymouth]] were controlled by Parliament, hindering the import of vital military supplies. From October 1642 to January 1643, the Royalists made several efforts to take one of them.\n\nIn the early stages of the war, neither side was equipped or trained for siege warfare, relying on surprise or treachery. When Hopton arrived at Exeter on 18 November, he found it occupied, and withdrew. In late December, he made a more serious attempt, before retreating on 4 January.\n\nFollowing a series of victories in summer 1643, the Royalists captured Exeter on 6 September; it remained in their possession until April 1646.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Ralph Hopton, 1st Baron Hopton of Stratton from NPG.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Royalist commander in the west, [[Ralph Hopton, 1st Baron Hopton|Sir Ralph Hopton]]]]\nWhen the war began in August 1642, [[Roundhead|Parliamentary]] forces secured most of southern England, including the ports of [[Southampton]] and [[Dover]], as well as the bulk of the [[Royal Navy]]. After [[Siege of Portsmouth|capturing Portsmouth]] in September, they controlled every major port from [[Plymouth]] to [[Siege of Hull (1642)|Hull]], hampering Royalist efforts to import arms and men from Europe.{{sfn|Wedgwood|1958|pp=119-120}}\n\nBy the end of September, most of [[Devon]] was held by Parliament, while Royalists under [[Ralph Hopton, 1st Baron Hopton|Sir Ralph Hopton]] secured [[Cornwall]]. In the early stages of the war, most soldiers on both sides were poorly trained and equipped [[Trained bands|militia]]. An exception was Plymouth, where the garrison was commanded by Colonel William Ruthven, and a contingent of experienced Scots mercenaries; their ship stopped to pick up supplies returning from Ireland in early October, and the Parliamentary town council hired them to defend the city.{{sfn|Barratt|2005|pp=35-38}}\n\nRuthven easily repulsed attempts to take Plymouth, and in early November Hopton crossed the [[River Tamar]], heading for [[Exeter]], although his troops refused to leave Cornwall until paid in advance. Royalist sympathisers told him it was largely undefended, although the town itself was controlled by supporters of Parliament.{{sfn|Royle|2004|p=235}} Its capture meant control of a vital port on the southern coast, an important export point for Devon wool, and whose position on the [[River Exe]] gave access to internal waterways, vital for transporting bulk supplies. It would also provide a base for Royalist [[privateers]].\n\nBy the time Hopton arrived at Exeter on 18 November, it had been occupied by a small force of Parliamentary cavalry under Captain Alexander Pym. After a brief exchange of artillery fire, the Royalists retreated to [[Tavistock]], and made another attempt on Plymouth.{{sfn|Barratt|2005|p=40}}\n\n==Siege==\n{{Location map many|West Country|caption = Western England, 1642 to 1646|relief=yes|border = black| width = 300| float = right\n|label =  BraddockDown|pos=left|lat_deg= 50|lat_min= 26|lon_deg = -4 |lon_min = -34\n|label2 = Exeter|pos2=right|lat2_deg= 50|lat2_min= 43|lon2_deg = -3 |lon2_min = -32\n|label3 = Bridestowe |pos3= top|lat3_deg=50|lat3_min = 44|lon3_deg = -4|lon3_min = 0\n|label4 = Wells|pos4= top|lat4_deg=51|lat4_min = 13|lon4_deg = -2|lon4_min = -39\n|label5 = Barnstaple|pos5=left|lat5_deg=51|lat5_min =05 |lon5_deg = -4 |lon5_min = -3\n|label6 = Sherborne|pos6=bottom|lat6_deg=50|lat6_min =57 |lon6_deg = -2 |lon6_min = -31\n|label7 = |pos7=left|lat7_deg=50|lat7_min = 28 |lon7_deg = -4 |lon7_min = -43\n|label8 = Launceston|pos8=left|lat8_deg=50|lat8_min = 38 |lon8_deg = -4 |lon8_min = -22\n|label9 = Roundway Down|pos9=top|lat9_deg=51|lat9_min = 21 |lon9_deg = -2 |lon9_min = 00\n|label10 = Minehead|pos10=left|lat10_deg=51|lat10_min = 12 |lon10_deg = -3 |lon10_min = -29\n|label12 = Stratton|pos12=left|lat12_deg=50|lat12_min = 50 |lon12_deg = -4 |lon12_min = -31\n|label13 = Plymouth|pos13=right|lat13_deg=50|lat13_min = 22 |lon13_deg = -4 |lon13_min = -9\n|label11 = Torrington|pos11=left|lat11_deg=50|lat11_min = 57 |lon11_deg = -4 |lon11_min = -8\n|label14 = Langport|pos14=left|lat14_deg=51|lat14_min = 03 |lon14_deg = -2 |lon14_min = -48\n|label15 = Truro|pos15=bottom|lat15_deg=50|lat15_min = 16 |lon15_deg = -5 |lon15_min = -03\n}}\nOnce again assured of local support, on 24 December Hopton attacked Exeter again, this time capturing [[Topsham]] and [[Powderham]] to the south, in order to prevent supplies being shipped in via the River Exe.

Administrative division of [[Russian Empire]] remained unchanged up to the end of [[World War I]]. When the war came to its end, in 1918 Lithuania was restored as an independent state.\n\nOn December 17, 1918, a circular No.1 was issued \"On Municipalities in Lithuania\" that declared that the entire area of Lithuania would be divided into the regions - apskritys (county sometimes translated into English as a provinces or counties). There were 10 apskritys in Lithuania.\n\nIn 1937 Siauliai county's overall territory was 6042&nbsp;km\u00b2 and 210 thousands people lived there. It was the largest apskritis in Lithuania.\n\nIn 1940 the [[Soviet Union]] occupied Lithuania and reformed the administrative system. The county system remained until 1950 when the counties were abolished and entire area was divided into smaller units - districts, or [[raion|rajonas]] in Lithuanian.\n\nOnly in 1994 - four years after the restoration of Lithuania's independence in 1990 - the apskritys were created again. However, the interwar apskritys should not be mixed with current apskritys, as their purpose, sizes, and number are all different, see [[administrative division of Lithuania]].

However, its role was only advisory in nature.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_Overview.aspx?fn=2752|title=Reserve Bank of India - Function Wise Monetary|website=www.rbi.org.in|access-date=2019-09-17}}</ref>\n\nThe setting up of a committee to decide on Monetary Policy was first proposed by the [[Urjit Patel]] Committee. The Committee suggested a five-member MPC - three members from the RBI and two nominated by the Government. The Government initially proposed a seven-member committee<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/finance/no-veto-power-for-rbi-governor-in-deciding-interest-rates-says-draft-code-115072400057_1.html|title=No veto power for RBI governor in deciding interest rates, says draft code|last=Reporter|first=B.

Subsequent negotiations led to the current composition of the committee, with the external members having a four-year term.{{fact|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe Reserve Bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Department (MPD) assists the MPC in formulating the monetary policy. Views of key stakeholders in the economy, and analytical work of the Reserve Bank contribute to the process for arriving at the decision on the policy repo rate. The Financial Markets Operations Department (FMOD) operationalises the monetary policy, mainly through day-to-day liquidity management operations. The Financial Markets Committee (FMC) meets daily to review the liquidity conditions so as to ensure that the operating target of monetary policy (weighted average lending rate) is kept close to the policy repo rate. Monetary Policy Committee came into force on 27 June 2016.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=https://pib.gov.in/newsite/printrelease.aspx?relid=146546|title=Government initiates process to constitute Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) under the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934|date=27 June 2016|work=Press Bureau of India|access-date=1 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nSuggestions for setting up a Monetary policy committee is not new and goes back to 2002 when YV Reddy committee proposed to establish a MPC, then Tarapore committee in 2006, Percy Mistry committee in 2007, Raghuram Rajan committee in 2009 and then Urjit Patel Committee in 2013.{{fact|date=August 2019}}\n\n== Composition ==\nThe composition of the current and first monetary policy committee is as follows:<ref name=\":0\" />\n# Governor of the Reserve Bank of India \u2013 Chairperson, ''ex officio -'' [[Shaktikanta Das]]\n# Deputy Governor of the Bank in charge of monetary policy \u2014 [[Michael Patra|Michael Debrata Patra]]<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.livemint.com/news/india/newly-appointed-deputy-governor-to-look-after-rbi-s-monetary-policy-division-11579097609165.html|title=Newly appointed deputy governor to look after RBI's monetary policy division|date=2020-01-15|website=[[Livemint]]|publisher=Vivek Khanna|language=en|publication-place=[[Mumbai]]|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-16|agency=[[Press Trust of India]]}}</ref>\n# Executive director of the Bank in charge of monetary policy \u2014 [[Janak Raj]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/rbi-appoints-ed-janak-raj-as-member-of-mpc/articleshow/73741480.cms|title=RBI appoints ED Janak Raj as member of MPC|date=2020-01-29|work=[[The Economic Times]]|access-date=2020-04-03|url-status=live|agency=[[Press Trust of India]]|publication-place=[[Mumbai]]|issn=0013-0389|oclc=61311680}}</ref>\n# Shri Chetan Ghate, Professor, Indian Statistical Institute (ISI) \u2013 Member;\n# Professor Pami Dua, Director, Delhi School of Economics \u2013 Member;\n# Dr. Ravindra H.
