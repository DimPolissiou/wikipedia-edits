It was fought on the extreme southern flank of the [[Battle of the Oder\u2013Neisse#Spremberg-Torgau Offensive|Spremberg-Torgau Offensive]], seeing days of pitched street fighting between forces of the [[Polish Second Army]] under elements of the Soviet [[52nd Army (Soviet Union)|52nd Army]] and [[5th Guards Army (Soviet Union)|5th Guards Army]]{{Ref label|a|a|none}} on one side and elements of German [[Army Group Center]] in the form of the remnants of the [[4th Panzer Army|4th Panzer]] and [[17th Army (Wehrmacht)|17th]] armies on the other.\n\nThe battle took place during [[Ivan Konev]]'s [[1st Ukrainian Front]]'s push toward Berlin, which was part of the larger Soviet [[Battle of Berlin|Berlin Offensive]]. The battle was fought in the town of [[Bautzen]] ({{lang-pl|Budziszyn}}) and the rural areas to the northeast situated primarily along the Bautzen\u2013[[Niesky]] line. Major combat began on 21 April 1945 and continued until 26 April although isolated engagements continued to take place until 30 April. The Polish Second Army under [[Karol \u015awierczewski]] suffered heavy losses, but, with the aid of Soviet reinforcements, prevented the German forces from breaking through to their rear. \n\nAfter the battle both sides claimed victory and modern views as to who won the battle remain contradictory. Because the war was almost over and the battle had no strategic impact on the ongoing Battle of Berlin, German historiography has focused more on its tactical aspects. The German operation successfully recaptured Bautzen and its surroundings, which were held until the end of the war.\n\n==Background==\nIn the last months of World War II, the Polish Second Army, under General Karol \u015awierczewski, took part in the Soviet drive on Berlin.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-122\"/> Part of Marshal Ivan Konev's 1st Ukrainian Front, the Poles operated in the centre of the front, flanked on the right by the 5th Guards Army and on the left by the [[7th Mechanized Corps (Soviet Union)|7th Mechanized Corps]].<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-123\"/> Opposing these forces was the [[4th Panzer Army]] under General [[Fritz-Hubert Gr\u00e4ser]], of Field Marshal [[Ferdinand Sch\u00f6rner]]'s [[Army Group Center]].<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-122\"/>\n\nOn 17 April, the Polish Second Army breached German defenses on the rivers [[Wei\u00dfer Sch\u00f6ps|Weisser Sch\u00f6ps]]<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-123\"/> and [[Neisse]]. Their pursuit of retreating German forces toward [[Dresden]] threatened to cut off additional forces in the [[Muskau Park|Muskauer Forst]] region.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-128\"/><ref name=\"Komornicki1967-130\"/> On 18 and 19 April elements of the Second Army (the 8th Infantry Division and [[1st Armoured Corps (Poland)|1st Armored Corps]]) engaged the Germans in the south and pushed them back while the remaining units (5th, 7th, 9th and 10th infantry divisions) drove on to Dresden, gaining bridgeheads on the River [[Spree]] north of Bautzen and destroying German forces in the Muskauer Forst.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-130\"/> The following day Soviet units of the 7th Mechanized Corps captured parts of Bautzen and secured the line south of [[Niesky]], taking [[Wei\u00dfenberg]] and trapping several German formations.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-131\"/><ref name=Ahlfen207208/>\n\n\u015awierczewski decided to prioritize the taking of Dresden over securing his southern flank, deviating from the plan he was given by Konev.<ref name=zw/> Meanwhile, Sch\u00f6rner was concentrating his units (the \"G\u00f6rlitz Group\") in the [[G\u00f6rlitz]] (Zgorzelec) and [[Reichenbach (Oberlausitz)|Reichenbach]] region, and planned to launch a counteroffensive at the southern flank of the Polish Army. His aim was to stop the 1st Front's advance and break through to Berlin to relieve the trapped [[9th Army (Wehrmacht)|9th Army]].<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-130\"/><ref name=\"Bahm2001\"/><ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/> The Germans were pinning their hopes on the idea that the Soviets might be fended off long enough for the city to be surrendered to the Western Allies.<ref name=\"Bahm2001\"/> The concentration of Sch\u00f6rner's units went unnoticed by Soviet and Polish reconnaissance.<ref name=zw/>\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===Opposing forces===\nGerman forces were composed of elements of the 4th Panzer Army and commanded by the headquarters for the ''Grossdeutschland'' and 57th Armored Corps.  For the battle, the Germans had two armored divisions (the [[20th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|20th]] and ''[[Fallschirm-Panzer Division 1 Hermann G\u00f6ring|Hermann G\u00f6ring]]''), two mechanized divisions (the ''[[Panzergrenadier Division Brandenburg|Brandenburg]]'' and ''[[Fallschirm-Panzergrenadier Division 2 Hermann G\u00f6ring|Hermann G\u00f6ring 2]]''), an infantry division (the [[17th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|17th]]) as well as an infantry division battle group (the remnants of the 545th Volksgrenadier Division).   This force counted some 50,000 soldiers, 300 tanks, and 600 guns.<ref name=Grzelak272/> The supply train of the [[10th SS Panzer Division Frundsberg|10th SS Panzer Division]] was also present near Bautzen.<ref name=LexikonWehrmacht/>{{Ref label|b|b|none}}\n\nThe Polish Second Army consisted of five infantry divisions: ([[Polish 5th Infantry Division|5th]], [[Polish 7th Infantry Division|7th]], [[Polish 8th Infantry Division|8th]], [[Polish 9th Infantry Division|9th]] and [[Polish 10th Infantry Division|10th]], the 1st Armored Corps, and smaller units), about 84,000\u201390,000 men, and 500 tanks.<ref name=zw/><ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/> Many of them were new recruits inexperienced in combat, incorporated from the recently retaken Polish territories.<ref name=zw/> The quality of the officer corps has also been questioned.<ref name=zw/> One of the major problems facing the People's Army was lack of a qualified cadre; a 1944 estimate showed that the army had one officer for each 1,200 soldiers.<ref name=\"Michta1990\"/> Many of the officers in the Polish Army were Soviet officers of Polish descent.<ref name=\"MaslovGlantz1998-182\"/>\n\nOverall, the German units were less numerous than the Polish forces, their equipment worn and supplies inferior. Polish sources describe the Germans as more experienced, however the German sources accentuate their mixed structure of experienced soldiers and inexperienced recruits of ''[[Hitlerjugend]]'' and ''[[Volkssturm]]'' units.<ref name=Eberhardt/><ref name=zw/>\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:Battle of Berlin 1945-a.png|thumb|Berlin operation|alt=Berlin operation]]\n[[File:Battle of Berlin 1945-b.png|thumb|Berlin operation|alt=Berlin operation]]\n[[File:Battle of Bautzen 1945-a.png|thumb|Map of the Battle of Bautzen (1)|alt=Map of the Battle of Bautzen (1)]]\n[[File:Battle of Bautzen 1945-b.png|thumb|Map of the Battle of Bautzen (2)|alt=Map of the Battle of Bautzen (2)]]\n\n===Drive on Dresden===\nOn 21 April, a gap had formed between the Polish infantry units (8th and 9th infantry divisions) and the 1st Armored Corps pushing towards Dresden, and the Polish units which were securing the Muskauer Forst region.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-131\"/> The 7th and 10th infantry divisions were engaged near Neisse and the 5th Infantry Division and the 16th Tank Brigade were in transit in between those two groups.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-131\"/> The Polish units were stretched over a line of {{convert|50|km|sp=us}}.<ref name=zw/> The Germans took the opportunity to push into this gap.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-131\"/> The battle started on 21 April.<ref name=\"zw\"/> In the west, the 20th Panzer Division started its drive on Bautzen, while in the east the 17th Infantry Division  advanced on Niesky and Wei\u00dfenberg, freeing trapped German troops on its way.<ref name=Ahlfen208/> The Germans drove between the Polish Second Army and the [[52nd Army (Soviet Union)|Soviet 52nd Army]] around Bautzen, some {{convert|40|km|sp=us}} north-east of Dresden and {{convert|25|km|sp=us}} west of G\u00f6rlitz, sweeping the Soviet units of the [[48th Rifle Corps]], and driving towards [[Spremberg]].<ref name=zw/><ref name=\"Komornicki1967-131\"/><ref name=\"Bahm2001\"/><ref name=\"Erickson1999\"/><ref name=\"Erickson1999\"/> Major General [[M.

The main body of the German force was located in the forested region around Lohsa.<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/> The Germans continued their push toward [[K\u00f6nigswartha]] and [[Hoyerswerda]].<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/>\n\n===Polish retreat===\nEventually, \u015awierczewski halted his force's advance on Dresden, and ordered it to pull back and secure the breach.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-134\"/><ref name=\"Komornicki1967-132\"/> On 22 April he ordered the 1st Armored Corps to change direction, retreat from Dresden and support the centre. The 8th Infantry Division was also recalled; however, the 9th remained near Dresden. For a while \u015awierczewski was out of communication with his superiors, including Marshal Konev.<ref name=\"Erickson1999\"/> Konev also sent his chief of staff, General [[Ivan Yefimovich Petrov]], and his chief of operations, General [[Vladimir Ivanovich Kostylev]], to look at the situation.<ref name=\"Bahm2001\"/><ref name=\"Erickson1999\"/> Petrov managed to re-establish communications, and left Kostylev in charge.<ref name=\"Bahm2001\"/> \u015awierczewski was briefly relieved of his command for incompetence.<ref name=\"zw\"/> To stabilize the situation, Konev ordered eight divisions from the Ukrainian Front to reinforce the Polish positions.<ref name=zw/> The [[14th Guards Rifle Division|Soviet 14th]] and [[95th Guards Rifle Division|95th Guards Rifle Divisions]], as well as the [[4th Guards Kantemirovskaya Tank Division|4th Guards Tank Corps]], were ordered to attack toward [[Kamenz]], K\u00f6nigswartha and [[Sdier]] to stop the Germans from advancing further north.<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\" /> The [[2nd Air Army]] was also assigned to this theater.<ref name=\"Erickson1999\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, the German advance to the southeast of Bautzen was successful. The Soviet [[294th Rifle Division]] was encircled at Wei\u00dfenberg by the ''Brandenburg'' Division.<ref name=Ahlfen208/> In its subsequent breakout on 24 April, large parts of the 294th Division were destroyed. At the same time at Bautzen the 20th Panzer Division was able to make contact with the trapped units in the town from the south. Bronikowski then lost no time and immediately ordered an attack into Bautzen. Coordinating with the trapped troops, he was able to break into the town. A hastily assembled Polish counterattack was not successful and most of Bautzen was then recaptured after several days of bloody [[house-to-house fighting|house-to-house combat]]. Several remaining pockets of resistance in the town were cleared during the next days.<ref name=Ahlfen208209/><ref name=B199942-46/> Outside the town the German advance stalled, as their troops were running low on fuel supplies.<ref name=Eberhardt/><ref name=zw/><ref name=\"Bahm2001\"/><ref name=\"Erickson1999\"/><ref name=\"Komornicki1967-134\"/> The recapture of Bautzen was one of the last successful German tactical victories on the Eastern Front.<ref name=\"WilliamsonAndrew2003\"/>\n\nBy 25 April, Polish units were able to stabilize a defense on the line Kamenz\u2013[[Kuckau]]\u2013north Bautzen\u2013Spree\u2013[[Spreewiese]]\u2013[[Kreba-Neudorf|Heideanger]].<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/><ref name=\"Komornicki1967-134\"/> On that day, [[Hitler]] congratulated Sch\u00f6rner on his \"victory\".<ref name=\"Mcateer2009\"/> The Polish 7th and 10th infantry divisions were ordered to advance toward Sdier-Heideanger.<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/> The 7th and 10th Polish infantry divisions slowly advanced, with the 10th reaching north of [[Uhyst|Spreefurt]].<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/><ref name=\"Komornicki1967-134\"/> With the Soviet units on their right flank they also secured a road to K\u00f6nigswartha.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-134\"/>\n\nThe 9th Division found itself alone at the spearhead of the abandoned Polish push towards Dresden. It received orders to retreat on 26 April.<ref name=as/> Attempting to withdraw quickly and to form back with the main forces, it was intercepted by the Germans and sustained heavy losses.<ref name=zw/> The units were moving with insufficient security, on the assumption that the line of retreat was safe; at the same time the Germans captured Polish orders with details of their planned withdrawal routes.<ref name=zw/> Coordination between the units was also lacking.<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/> 26th Infantry Regiment from the 9th Division took very heavy casualties (75 percent) in the \"valley of death\" around [[Panschwitz-Kuckau]] and [[Crostwitz]].<ref name=zw/> A Polish [[military hospital]] convoy from the same division was ambushed near [[Horka, Saxony|Horka]], with [[War crimes of the Wehrmacht|most of its personnel and wounded executed]] (about 300 casualties). There was only one survivor, chaplain Jan Rdzanek.<ref name=zw/><ref name=\"GrzelakSta\u0144czyk1993\"/> The division commander, Colonel [[Aleksander \u0141aski]], was taken captive.<ref name=zw/><ref name=zw/> As a result of these losses, the 9th Division ceased to be an effective force; the remaining personnel were merged into the Soviet [[19th Guards Rifle Division]].<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/>\n\nAccording to some sources, 26 April marks the end of this battle, although less severe and isolated clashes in that region continued until 30 April.<ref name=zw/> Other sources note that heavy fighting still took place on 27 April, and that the German advance was only completely halted by 28 April.<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/> By the end of the month, the Polish Second Army and the Soviet forces had repelled the German attack, forming a line toward Kamenz\u2013[[Dobersch\u00fctz]]\u2013[[Dauban]], and was preparing to launch an offensive toward [[Prague]].<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-134\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Pomnik \u017co\u0142nierzy polskich Crostwitz.jpg|thumb|upright|Monument to Polish soldiers in [[Crostwitz]]]]\nBoth sides suffered heavy casualties.<ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/><ref name=\"Komornicki1967-134\"/> The Polish casualties were particularly severe.<ref name=zw/> In a relatively short time the Polish Second Army lost more than 22 percent of its personnel and 57 percent of its tanks and armored vehicles (about 200 total).<ref name=zw/><ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/> Official estimates claimed about 18,000 casualties (including almost 5,000 dead).<ref name=zw/> Some other estimates give the Polish casualties as up to 25,000.<ref name=zw/> According to Polish historian [[Zbigniew Wawer]], this was the most bloody battle that the [[Polish Army]] had been involved in since the [[battle of Bzura]] in 1939.<ref name=zw/>\n\nGerman casualties were significant, but less than the Polish and Soviet ones; contemporary Polish sources estimated German losses at 6,500 personnel, which is now seen as an inflated estimate.<ref name=zw/> The German forces failed in their objective of breaking through the 1st Ukrainian Front and coming to the aid of Berlin.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-134\"/><ref name=\"Komornicki1967-138\"/> They managed, however, to inflict very serious casualties on the local Polish and Soviet units and stopped the Polish drive on Dresden (it was still in German hands at the time of the German capitulation on May 9).<ref name=zw/> The successful recapture of Bautzen, Wei\u00dfenberg and surroundings is called one of the last successful German armored counterattacks of the war. Bautzen and surroundings stayed in German hands until [[German Instrument of Surrender|Germany's capitulation]].

It was fought on the extreme southern flank of the [[Battle of the Oder\u2013Neisse#Spremberg-Torgau Offensive|Spremberg-Torgau Offensive]], seeing days of pitched street fighting between forces of the [[Polish Second Army]] under elements of the Soviet [[52nd Army (Soviet Union)|52nd Army]] and [[5th Guards Army (Soviet Union)|5th Guards Army]]{{Ref label|a|a|none}} on one side and elements of German [[Army Group Center]] in the form of the remnants of the [[4th Panzer Army|4th Panzer]] and [[17th Army (Wehrmacht)|17th]] armies on the other.\n\nThe battle took place during [[Ivan Konev]]'s [[1st Ukrainian Front]]'s push toward Berlin, which was part of the larger Soviet [[Battle of Berlin|Berlin Offensive]]. The battle was fought in the town of [[Bautzen]] ({{lang-pl|Budziszyn}}) and the rural areas to the northeast situated primarily along the Bautzen\u2013[[Niesky]] line. Major combat began on 21 April 1945 and continued until 26 April although isolated engagements continued to take place until 30 April. The Polish Second Army under [[Karol \u015awierczewski]] suffered heavy losses, but, with the aid of Soviet reinforcements, prevented the German forces from breaking through to their rear. \n\nAfter the battle both sides claimed victory and modern views as to who won the battle remain contradictory. Because the war was almost over and the battle had no strategic impact on the ongoing Battle of Berlin, German historiography has focused more on its tactical aspects. The German operation successfully recaptured Bautzen and its surroundings, which were held until the end of the war.\n\n==Background==\nIn the last months of World War II, the Polish Second Army, under General Karol \u015awierczewski, took part in the Soviet drive on Berlin.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-122\"/> Part of Marshal Ivan Konev's 1st Ukrainian Front, the Poles operated in the centre of the front, flanked on the right by the 5th Guards Army and on the left by the [[7th Mechanized Corps (Soviet Union)|7th Mechanized Corps]].<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-123\"/> Opposing these forces was the [[4th Panzer Army]] under General [[Fritz-Hubert Gr\u00e4ser]], of Field Marshal [[Ferdinand Sch\u00f6rner]]'s [[Army Group Center]].<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-122\"/>\n\nOn 17 April, the Polish Second Army breached German defenses on the rivers [[Wei\u00dfer Sch\u00f6ps|Weisser Sch\u00f6ps]]<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-123\"/> and [[Neisse]]. Their pursuit of retreating German forces toward [[Dresden]] threatened to cut off additional forces in the [[Muskau Park|Muskauer Forst]] region.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-128\"/><ref name=\"Komornicki1967-130\"/> On 18 and 19 April elements of the Second Army (the 8th Infantry Division and [[1st Armoured Corps (Poland)|1st Armored Corps]]) engaged the Germans in the south and pushed them back while the remaining units (5th, 7th, 9th and 10th infantry divisions) drove on to Dresden, gaining bridgeheads on the River [[Spree]] north of Bautzen and destroying German forces in the Muskauer Forst.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-130\"/> The following day Soviet units of the 7th Mechanized Corps captured parts of Bautzen and secured the line south of [[Niesky]], taking [[Wei\u00dfenberg]] and trapping several German formations.<ref name=\"Komornicki1967-131\"/><ref name=Ahlfen207208/>\n\n\u015awierczewski decided to prioritize the taking of Dresden over securing his southern flank, deviating from the plan he was given by Konev.<ref name=zw/> Meanwhile, Sch\u00f6rner was concentrating his units (the \"G\u00f6rlitz Group\") in the [[G\u00f6rlitz]] (Zgorzelec) and [[Reichenbach (Oberlausitz)|Reichenbach]] region, and planned to launch a counteroffensive at the southern flank of the Polish Army.

For the battle, the Germans had two armored divisions (the [[20th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|20th]] and ''[[Fallschirm-Panzer Division 1 Hermann G\u00f6ring|Hermann G\u00f6ring]]''), two mechanized divisions (the ''[[Panzergrenadier Division Brandenburg|Brandenburg]]'' and ''[[Fallschirm-Panzergrenadier Division 2 Hermann G\u00f6ring|Hermann G\u00f6ring 2]]''), an infantry division (the [[17th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|17th]]) as well as an infantry division battle group (the remnants of the 545th Volksgrenadier Division).   This force counted some 50,000 soldiers, 300 tanks, and 600 guns.<ref name=Grzelak272/> The supply train of the [[10th SS Panzer Division Frundsberg|10th SS Panzer Division]] was also present near Bautzen.<ref name=LexikonWehrmacht/>{{Ref label|b|b|none}}\n\nThe Polish Second Army consisted of five infantry divisions: ([[Polish 5th Infantry Division|5th]], [[Polish 7th Infantry Division|7th]], [[Polish 8th Infantry Division|8th]], [[Polish 9th Infantry Division|9th]] and [[Polish 10th Infantry Division|10th]], the 1st Armored Corps, and smaller units), about 84,000\u201390,000 men, and 500 tanks.<ref name=zw/><ref name=\"KomorowskiHistorycznych2009\"/> Many of them were new recruits inexperienced in combat, incorporated from the recently retaken Polish territories.<ref name=zw/> The quality of the officer corps has also been questioned.<ref name=zw/> One of the major problems facing the People's Army was lack of a qualified cadre; a 1944 estimate showed that the army had one officer for each 1,200 soldiers.<ref name=\"Michta1990\"/> Many of the officers in the Polish Army were Soviet officers of Polish descent.<ref name=\"MaslovGlantz1998-182\"/>\n\nOverall, the German units were less numerous than the Polish forces, their equipment worn and supplies inferior.

While Peru felt that the matter was already decided in the [[Ecuadorian-Peruvian War]] of 1941, Ecuador did not agree with the [[Rio de Janeiro Protocol]]. Later in 1998 the Guarantors of the Rio Protocol ruled that the border of the undelimited zone was indeed the line of the Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor, as Peru had been claiming since the 1940s. \n\nIn the aftermath of the incident, both sides increased their military presence along the [[Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor]] area and Cenepa Valley, starting an escalating spiral of tension and provocation that finally resulted in another military confrontation in 1995, the [[Cenepa War]].\n\nWhile the name ''Paquisha War'' is widely used by the international community and Ecuador, in Spanish this incident is also known as the '''Falso Paquisha War''' (''Conflicto del Falso Paquisha'') in Peru and, occasionally, as the '''Paquisha Incident''' or the '''Upper Comaina Conflict''' (''conflicto del Alto Comaina'').\n\n==Historical background==\n''For details on the history of the border dispute between Ecuador and Peru, please see [[History of the Ecuadorian-Peruvian territorial dispute]].''\n\n===The Paquisha or \"Fake Paquisha\" Incident===\nThe dispute revolved around the existence of three Ecuadorian military outposts, called Paquisha, Mayaico, and Machinaza, located in the valley of the Comaina River, beyond the eastern slopes of the [[Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor|Condor range]] (in Spanish, ''Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor''). While these posts were located in the as yet non-demarcated zone of the Ecuadorian-Peruvian border, the establishment of these posts was considered by the Peruvian Government as a violation of a ''[[status quo]]'' line arranged between the military leaders of both countries in the course of several meetings at the end of the 1970s. During these agreements both sides would have agreed not to establish any new military posts in the disputed areas,<ref>Mena, 1981</ref> which would have meant for Ecuador not to establish any military presence to the east of the ridgeline of the Condor Range.\n\nThe Ecuadorian possession of these posts was denounced by Peruvian representatives at the foreign ministers' meeting of the [[Organization of American States|OAS]], on February 2, 1981. During this meeting, the Peruvian Foreign Minister, [[Javier Arias Stella]], called the three Ecuadorian military outposts ''falsos'' (\"fakes\"), despite Ecuadorian sovereignty.\n\nEcuadorians indicated that these detachments corresponded to the \"Paquisha\" base established in Ecuadorian territory. But, after measuring the coordinates, it was found that they did not correspond to the aforementioned Paquisha accepted in the [[Rio Protocol|Protocol of Rio de Janeiro]] but, as the Peruvian president [[Fernando Bela\u00fande Terry|Fernando Bela\u00fande]] described it, to a \"False Paquisha\", a name he gave to distinguish it easily from the first Paquisha that was legal according to the Rio protocol of 1942<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306200426/https://www.mindef.gob.pe/vercontenido.php?archivo=menu%2Fhistoricos%2Fefem-nacional%2Fefeme-enero3.htm&retorno=si|title=Operations of the False Paquisha|last=|first=|website=Ministry of Defense of Peru|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>.\n\nThe Ecuadorian Foreign Minister, [[Alfonso Barrera Valderde]], responded to this allegation stating that when Ecuador responded to the attacks on January 22, it always specified that the attacks were being made against the ''destacamentos'' (military outposts) of Paquisha, Mayaicu, and Machinaza, not against the similarly named Ecuadorian towns.<ref>Mena Villamar, Claudio.

The FAE flew 179 combat missions with [[A-37 Dragonfly|A-37B]] and [[Mirage F-1]] aircraft to counter the FAP attacks. On January 28, 1981 there was a dogfight between 2 A-37Bs of the FAE and FAP.\n\nOn January 30, 1981, [[Peruvian Army|Peruvian troops]] recover the \"PV-22\" (False Paquisha), the next day they recover the \"PV-3\", and on February 1, 1981, they recover the \"PV-4\" (New ) or \"false Mayaico\".\n\nBy that day, the conflict was apparently over but then Peruvians discovered that more troops from Ecuador had settled in 3 other military posts and 3 points on the northeastern border of the Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor and were the \"PV El Mirador\" posts, \"PV-4-A\" and \"PV-4-B\" (Old).\n\nOn February 19, 1981, Peruvians recovered the \"PV Jim\u00e9nez Banda 2\" (False Machinaza) and the next day, on February 20, 1981, the \"PV-4-A\" and \"PV-4-B\" (Old ).\n\nOn February 21, 1981, the [[Peruvian Air Force|Aviation of the Peruvian Army]] destroyed the last military installations of the [[Ecuadorian Army|Army of Ecuador]] that were still in the Peruvian territory.\n\nThe Peruvian operation was a success, the outpost of ''Falso Paquisha'', that was occupied by the Ecuadorians, was taken on February 5, 1981 by Peruvian troops. The conflict, which occurred in a then non-demarcated area of the common border between Ecuador and Peru, ceased with the Ecuadorians being expelled from the slopes and driven back to the summit of the ''Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor''.\n\nThe [[Organization of American States]] (OAS), had to intervene through the Sorrosa-Du Bois Act, setting the location coordinates allowed for border troops, ratifying the condition of the mentioned mountain range as a natural boundary between the two countries.\n\nAccording to a Peruvian journalistic information, which shows a photo that shows the capture of a powerful machine gun multiple guns with 4 guns of 50 mm. of caliber in \u201cFalse Paquisha\u201d, the installation of this type of armament represented the symbol of the gravity of the premeditated Ecuadorian invasion in Peruvian territory, through the Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tierra-inca.com/album/photos/view.php?dep=1&id=2364|title=Conflict with Ecuador, False Paquisha|last=|first=|date=|website=Inca Land|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>.

Levoyer proposed a new plan which placed all personnel, weapons, supplies, etc., in twenty-four hours in the front and ready to fulfill the mission of defense.\n\nThe Peruvian armed forces were surprised by the rapid deployment of Ecuadorian forces, so, thinking that Levoyer and his men might invade the north of Peru, they organized anti-tank defense lines, trenches, and other defenses.\n\nFortunately, events did not lead to general war. The widespread confrontation was avoided probably because of the direct talks between top military Commanders of the two countries, and the military Delegates of Chile, Argentina, Brazil and USA. The talks took place in the border line near the Pacific Ocean, in the towns of Huaquillas (Ecuador, Province of El Oro) and Aguas Verdes (Peru, Department of Tumbes). The result was the Sorrosa-Du Bois Act.\n\nThe cycle of direct face to face talks included Levoyer who was called by the Peruvians the leader of the \"hard line\". While they ran, Levoyer staged exercises both to encourage his men and to undermine the morale of their Peruvian opponents who had to get used to the daily six o'clock in the morning start of the exercises, which included artillery and other displays of force.\n\n===Aftermath===\nBorder violence remained constant until the resolution of the [[History of the Ecuadorian-Peruvian territorial dispute#Resolution and arbitration|Ecuadorian-Peruvian territorial dispute]] in 1998 through the [[Brasilia Presidential Act]]. Violence occurred most of the time around January, which coincides with the month that the [[Rio Protocol]] was signed. Despite several proposals to complete demarcation of the border, no agreement was possible at that time.\n\nSeveral military bases were built up and down the Cordillera by both countries, and the region was militarized. The Peruvian bases were serviced by helicopter, while on the Ecuadorian side, gravel roads were constructed to several military border posts.\n\nSome sources claim that the Ecuadorian resistance to the full implementation of the border demarcation during the 1970s and 1980s was almost entirely due to domestic political struggles.\n\nAccording to the USIP, after this war, Ecuador's Foreign Ministry conducted a national opinion survey that reportedly confirmed the popularity of nullification of the Rio Protocol and Ecuador's right to sovereign access to the [[Amazon river]]. Thus, in 1983, the Ecuadorian congress reaffirmed its position on the nullity of the [[Rio Protocol]].\n\nIn the \"''Paquisha book, the whole truth''\" of the Ecuadorian writer Claudio Mena said the author argues that Ecuadorian President [[Jaime Rold\u00f3s Aguilera]] had planned to inaugurate on February 12 those surveillance posts that [[Ecuador]] had installed in the territory of [[Peru]] to show the world that this territory was \" Ecuadorian soil<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://archive.is/IFXjg|title=Paquisha or the False Story|last=Mena Villamar|first=Claudio|work=Diary Hoy, Ecuador|access-date=}}</ref> \"\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*''[http://www.caretas.com.pe/1349/rio-cenepa/cenepa.html Interview with Peruvian President Fernando Belaunder Terry, Falso Paquisha Incident]'' Caretas\n*''[http://www.acig.org/artman/publish/article_164.shtml Detailed information about the military actions in the Paquisha Incident]''\n*''[http://ecuador.nativeweb.org/border/border1.html The 1995 Peruvian-Ecuadorian border conflict]\n\n{{Ecuador topics}}\n\n[[Category:Ecuadorian\u2013Peruvian wars]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1981]]\n[[Category:1981 in Ecuador]]\n[[Category:History of Ecuador]]\n[[Category:1981 in Peru]]\n[[Category:History of Peru]]\n[[Category:Territorial disputes of Peru]]\n[[Category:Territorial disputes of Ecuador]]\n[[Category:Ecuador\u2013Peru border]]\n[[Category:January 1981 events in South America]]\n[[Category:February 1981 events in South America]]\n", "text_old": "{{More footnotes|date=July 2017}}\n{{Infobox military conflict\n| conflict    = Paquisha War\n| partof      = the [[History of the Ecuadorian-Peruvian territorial dispute|Ecuadorian-Peruvian conflicts]]\n| image       = Ecuador-Peru-Frontera.svg\n| image_size  = 280\n| caption     = Ecuador\u2013Peru border\n| date        = {{start and end dates|1981|01|22|1981|02|05|df=y}}\n| place       = Condor mountain range\n| result      = Peruvian Victory <ref>{{cite web|title=Conflicto del Alto Comaina, Ecured Cuba|url=https://www.ecured.cu/Conflicto_del_Alto_Comaina|accessdate=18 February 2013|language=Spanish}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=\u2018False Paquisha\u2019: 37 years after a military feat, Expreso Diary|url=https://www.expreso.com.pe/actualidad/falso-paquisha-a-37-anos-de-una-proeza-militar/|accessdate=29 January 2018|language=Spanish}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The other victory: How we achieve peace with Ecuador|url=https://revistaideele.com/ideele/content/la-otra-victoria-c%C3%B3mo-logramos-la-paz-con-el-ecuador|accessdate=7 March 2017|language=Spanish}}</ref>\n| combatant1  = {{flag|Peru}}\n| combatant2  = {{flag|Ecuador}}\n| commander1  = {{ubl|[[Fernando Bela\u00fande Terry]]|[[Rafael Hoyos Rubio]]}}\n| commander2  = [[Jaime Rold\u00f3s Aguilera]]\n| strength1   = unknown\n| strength2   = 53 men<ref>{{cite web|title=Paquisha, 35 a\u00f1os de este importante nombre en la historia del Ecuador|url=https://www.eluniverso.com/noticias/2016/01/21/nota/5359180/paquisha-nombre-historia-ecuador|accessdate=8 January 2018|language=Spanish}}</ref>\n| casualties1 = 17 killed\n| casualties2 = {{ubl|16 killed|30 wounded}}\n| campaignbox = {{Campaignbox Ecuadorian-Peruvian}}\n}}\n\nThe '''Paquisha War''' ({{Lang-es|guerra de Paquisha}}) was a military clash that took place between January and February 1981 between [[Ecuador]] and [[Peru]] over the control of three watchposts.

The result was the Sorrosa-Du Bois Act.\n\nThe cycle of direct face to face talks included Levoyer who was called by the Peruvians the leader of the \"hard line\". While they ran, Levoyer staged exercises both to encourage his men and to undermine the morale of their Peruvian opponents who had to get used to the daily six o'clock in the morning start of the exercises, which included artillery and other displays of force.\n\n===Aftermath===\nBorder violence remained constant until the resolution of the [[History of the Ecuadorian-Peruvian territorial dispute#Resolution and arbitration|Ecuadorian-Peruvian territorial dispute]] in 1998 through the [[Brasilia Presidential Act]]. Violence occurred most of the time around January, which coincides with the month that the [[Rio Protocol]] was signed. Despite several proposals to complete demarcation of the border, no agreement was possible at that time.\n\nSeveral military bases were built up and down the Cordillera by both countries, and the region was militarized. The Peruvian bases were serviced by helicopter, while on the Ecuadorian side, gravel roads were constructed to several military border posts.\n\nSome sources claim that the Ecuadorian resistance to the full implementation of the border demarcation during the 1970s and 1980s was almost entirely due to domestic political struggles.\n\nAccording to the USIP, after this war, Ecuador's Foreign Ministry conducted a national opinion survey that reportedly confirmed the popularity of nullification of the Rio Protocol and Ecuador's right to sovereign access to the [[Amazon river]]. Thus, in 1983, the Ecuadorian congress reaffirmed its position on the nullity of the [[Rio Protocol]].\n\nIn the \"''Paquisha book, the whole truth''\" of the Ecuadorian writer Claudio Mena said the author argues that Ecuadorian President [[Jaime Rold\u00f3s Aguilera]] had planned to inaugurate on February 12 those surveillance posts that [[Ecuador]] had installed in the territory of [[Peru]] to show the world that this territory was \" Ecuadorian soil<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://archive.is/IFXjg|title=Paquisha or the False Story|last=Mena Villamar|first=Claudio|work=Diary Hoy, Ecuador|access-date=}}</ref> \"\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*''[http://www.caretas.com.pe/1349/rio-cenepa/cenepa.html Interview with Peruvian President Fernando Belaunder Terry, Falso Paquisha Incident]'' Caretas\n*''[http://www.acig.org/artman/publish/article_164.shtml Detailed information about the military actions in the Paquisha Incident]''\n*''[http://ecuador.nativeweb.org/border/border1.html The 1995 Peruvian-Ecuadorian border conflict]\n\n{{Ecuador topics}}\n\n[[Category:Ecuadorian\u2013Peruvian wars]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1981]]\n[[Category:1981 in Ecuador]]\n[[Category:History of Ecuador]]\n[[Category:1981 in Peru]]\n[[Category:History of Peru]]\n[[Category:Territorial disputes of Peru]]\n[[Category:Territorial disputes of Ecuador]]\n[[Category:Ecuador\u2013Peru border]]\n[[Category:January 1981 events in South America]]\n[[Category:February 1981 events in South America]]\n", "name_user": "Valdemar7070", "label": "safe", "comment": "bibliographic source added", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paquisha_War"}

The engineer, William Rockefeller, later admitted that before reaching the curve he had gone into a \"daze\", a sort of [[highway hypnosis]].\n\nThe leader of the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB) team investigating said it was likely that the accident would have been prevented had [[positive train control]] (PTC) been installed per a prior federal mandate requiring its installation by 2015. Due to a number of other recent accidents involving Metro-North trains and tracks, the [[Federal Railroad Administration]] (FRA) demanded improved safety measures, which Metro-North began implementing within a week of the accident.\n\nIn late 2014, almost a year after the accident, the NTSB released its final report on the accident. After reiterating its earlier conclusion that PTC would have prevented the accident entirely, it found the most direct cause was Rockefeller's inattention as the train entered the curve. There were other contributing factors. A medical examination following the accident diagnosed [[sleep apnea]], which had hampered his ability to fully adjust his sleep patterns to the morning shift which he had begun working two weeks earlier. The report faulted both Metro-North for not screening its employees in sensitive positions for [[sleep disorder]]s, and the FRA for not requiring railroads to do such screening.<ref name=\"NTSB brief\" />\n\n=={{anchor|Train}}Background==\n\nThe train involved in the accident was the second southbound [[Hudson Line (Metro-North)|Hudson Line]] train of the day, leaving [[Poughkeepsie (Metro-North station)|Poughkeepsie]], the line's northern terminus, at its scheduled departure time of 5:54&nbsp;a.m. [[Eastern Standard Time (North America)|EST]].<ref name=\"current Metro-North schedule\">[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]], {{cite web|url= http://web.mta.info/mnr/html/planning/schedules/pdf/NOV172013HUD-SS.pdf |title=Hudson Line weekend schedule|publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]|date= November 17, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216041718/http://www.mta.info/mnr/html/planning/schedules/pdf/NOV172013HUD-SS.pdf|archivedate=December 16, 2013|accessdate=April 13, 2020}}</ref> It was powered by a [[GE Genesis|GE P32AC-DM]] [[dual-mode locomotive|locomotive]],<ref name=\"Rockefeller interview transcript\">{{cite web|title=Transcript of Interview 8808 Engineer|url=http://dms.ntsb.gov/public%2F55500-55999%2F55841%2F551511.pdf|publisher=[[National Transportation Safety Board]]|page=48|date=December 3, 2013|accessdate=October 31, 2014}}</ref> capable of running on either diesel fuel or electricity from a [[third rail]].

After a [[2008 Chatsworth train collision|2008 wreck]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], the FRA mandated all American railroads implement PTC by 2015. Many resisted, complaining about the cost of the technology. Among those railroads were both MTA commuter railroads, Metro-North and the [[Long Island Rail Road]], which have sought to have that deadline extended until 2018. In the wake of the Spuyten Duyvil derailment, U.S. Rep. [[Sean Patrick Maloney]], a resident of [[Cold Spring, New York|Cold Spring]] whose neighbor James Lovell was one of those killed, introduced legislation to make low-interest loans and guarantees available so that commuter railroads like Metro-North could implement PTC.<ref name=\"FRA letter story\" /> Eventually other congressmembers from the lower Hudson Valley joined as cosponsors.<ref name=\"Journal News Deep Dive story\">{{cite news|last=Juva-Brown|first=Theresa|title=Bronx derailment: Grants program pushed for Metro-North|url=http://www.lohud.com/article/20131215/NEWS/312150049/Bronx-derailment-Grants-program-pushed-Metro-North-|newspaper=[[The Journal News]]|date=December 15, 2013|accessdate=December 18, 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Metro-North crew installing speed restriction sign.jpg|thumb|left|Metro-North crews install speed-restriction sign on a stretch of the [[New Haven Line]] two weeks after the Spuyten Duyvil accident|alt=Four men in reflectorized orange vests and neon green helmets standing next to a set of four railroad tracks installing a signpost next to the track.

Instead they pointed to doubts about the technology's efficacy for large commuter rail networks. On a radio talk show following the crash, New York Governor [[Andrew Cuomo]] conceded that PTC is \"controversial ... [some people say] it's not what it's cracked up to be.\" The MTA itself said it was \"untested and unproven for commuter railroads [of our] size and complexity.\"<ref name=\"NYT alerter story\" />\n\nSeveral days later ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that the train had a device known as an [[cab signalling#Cab signalling in the United States|alerter]]. It sounds an alarm when the train exceeds speed limits for 25 seconds and shuts it down after an additional 15 seconds if no action is taken by the engineer. It might have been able to prevent the accident; however it was in the locomotive, at the rear of the train, not the cab where Rockefeller was located.<ref name=\"NYT alerter story\" />\n\nWhile Metro-North used it only to prevent collisions, rail safety experts said it could easily be configured to force trains to slow down at curves such as Spuyten Duyvil, since it relied on signals sent through the rails themselves. It was also preferable to the traditional [[dead man's switch]] the cab was equipped with, which requires constant action and attention from the engineer. The MTA said it was considering doing so at 30 sites on the Metro-North and LIRR networks.<ref name=\"NYT alerter story\" /> On December 6, the FRA issued an emergency order requiring Metro-North to have two qualified crew members in the cab at any point where the speed limit drops by more than {{convert|20|mph}} until it installs that technology in cabs and at those sites.<ref name=\"FRA mandate story\" /> The next day Metro-North announced it was upgrading the signals at the Spuyten Duyvil curve and several others in the system; it would also lower the speed limit going into the curve so that it would be a less-than-20-mph drop and thus the extra engineer would not be necessary.<ref name=\"MTA changes story\">{{cite news|title=Safety Upgrades Coming to Metro-North Derailment Site: MTA|url=http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Safety-Upgrades-MTA-Metro-North-Train-Derailment-Bronx-Spuyten-Duyvil-Curve-234987791.html|newspaper=[[WNBC-TV]]|date=December 8, 2013|accessdate=December 8, 2013}}</ref> U.S. Senators [[Richard Blumenthal]] of Connecticut and [[Charles Schumer]] of New York called on Metro-North to install cameras to monitor both the track and the engineers.<ref name=\"Senators call for cameras\">{{cite news|last=Castillo|first=Alfonso A.|title=Senators call for train cameras to monitor engineer, track|url=http://www.newsday.com/long-island/senators-call-for-train-cameras-to-monitor-engineer-track-1.6564959|newspaper=[[Newsday]]|date=December 8, 2013|accessdate=December 9, 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn December 12, the FRA went further. It ordered \"Operation Deep Dive,\"<ref name=\"Journal News Deep Dive story\" /> a full safety review of Metro-North, in which every aspect of its corporate culture would be evaluated by a panel of rail safety experts.

The engineer, William Rockefeller, later admitted that before reaching the curve he had gone into a \"daze\", a sort of [[highway hypnosis]].\n\nThe leader of the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB) team investigating said it was likely that the accident would have been prevented had [[positive train control]] (PTC) been installed per a prior federal mandate requiring its installation by 2015. Due to a number of other recent accidents involving Metro-North trains and tracks, the [[Federal Railroad Administration]] (FRA) demanded improved safety measures, which Metro-North began implementing within a week of the accident.\n\nIn late 2014, almost a year after the accident, the NTSB released its final report on the accident. After reiterating its earlier conclusion that PTC would have prevented the accident entirely, it found the most direct cause was Rockefeller's inattention as the train entered the curve. There were other contributing factors. A medical examination following the accident diagnosed [[sleep apnea]], which had hampered his ability to fully adjust his sleep patterns to the morning shift which he had begun working two weeks earlier. The report faulted both Metro-North for not screening its employees in sensitive positions for [[sleep disorder]]s, and the FRA for not requiring railroads to do such screening.<ref name=\"NTSB brief\" />\n\n=={{anchor|Train}}Background==\n\nThe train involved in the accident was the second southbound [[Hudson Line (Metro-North)|Hudson Line]] train of the day, leaving [[Poughkeepsie (Metro-North station)|Poughkeepsie]], the line's northern terminus, at its scheduled departure time of 5:54&nbsp;a.m. [[Eastern Standard Time (North America)|EST]].<ref name=\"current Metro-North schedule\">[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]], {{cite web|url= http://web.mta.info/mnr/html/planning/schedules/pdf/NOV172013HUD-SS.pdf |title=Hudson Line weekend schedule|publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]|date= November 17, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216041718/http://www.mta.info/mnr/html/planning/schedules/pdf/NOV172013HUD-SS.pdf|archivedate=December 16, 2013|accessdate=April 13, 2020}}</ref> It was powered by a [[GE Genesis|GE P32AC-DM]] [[dual-mode locomotive|locomotive]],<ref name=\"Rockefeller interview transcript\">{{cite web|title=Transcript of Interview 8808 Engineer|url=http://dms.ntsb.gov/public%2F55500-55999%2F55841%2F551511.pdf|publisher=[[National Transportation Safety Board]]|page=48|date=December 3, 2013|accessdate=October 31, 2014}}</ref> capable of running on either diesel fuel or electricity from a [[third rail]].

After a [[2008 Chatsworth train collision|2008 wreck]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], the FRA mandated all American railroads implement PTC by 2015. Many resisted, complaining about the cost of the technology. Among those railroads were both MTA commuter railroads, Metro-North and the [[Long Island Rail Road]], which have sought to have that deadline extended until 2018. In the wake of the Spuyten Duyvil derailment, U.S. Rep. [[Sean Patrick Maloney]], a resident of [[Cold Spring, New York|Cold Spring]] whose neighbor James Lovell was one of those killed, introduced legislation to make low-interest loans and guarantees available so that commuter railroads like Metro-North could implement PTC.<ref name=\"FRA letter story\" /> Eventually other congressmembers from the lower Hudson Valley joined as cosponsors.<ref name=\"Journal News Deep Dive story\">{{cite news|last=Juva-Brown|first=Theresa|title=Bronx derailment: Grants program pushed for Metro-North|url=http://www.lohud.com/article/20131215/NEWS/312150049/Bronx-derailment-Grants-program-pushed-Metro-North-|newspaper=[[The Journal News]]|date=December 15, 2013|accessdate=December 18, 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Metro-North crew installing speed restriction sign.jpg|thumb|left|Metro-North crews install speed-restriction sign on a stretch of the [[New Haven Line]] two weeks after the Spuyten Duyvil accident|alt=Four men in reflectorized orange vests and neon green helmets standing next to a set of four railroad tracks installing a signpost next to the track.

Instead they pointed to doubts about the technology's efficacy for large commuter rail networks. On a radio talk show following the crash, New York Governor [[Andrew Cuomo]] conceded that PTC is \"controversial ... [some people say] it's not what it's cracked up to be.\" The MTA itself said it was \"untested and unproven for commuter railroads [of our] size and complexity.\"<ref name=\"NYT alerter story\" />\n\nSeveral days later ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that the train had a device known as an [[cab signalling#Cab signalling in the United States|alerter]]. It sounds an alarm when the train exceeds speed limits for 25 seconds and shuts it down after an additional 15 seconds if no action is taken by the engineer. It might have been able to prevent the accident; however it was in the locomotive, at the rear of the train, not the cab where Rockefeller was located.<ref name=\"NYT alerter story\" />\n\nWhile Metro-North used it only to prevent collisions, rail safety experts said it could easily be configured to force trains to slow down at curves such as Spuyten Duyvil, since it relied on signals sent through the rails themselves. It was also preferable to the traditional [[dead man's switch]] the cab was equipped with, which requires constant action and attention from the engineer. The MTA said it was considering doing so at 30 sites on the Metro-North and LIRR networks.<ref name=\"NYT alerter story\" /> On December 6, the FRA issued an emergency order requiring Metro-North to have two qualified crew members in the cab at any point where the speed limit drops by more than {{convert|20|mph}} until it installs that technology in cabs and at those sites.<ref name=\"FRA mandate story\" /> The next day Metro-North announced it was upgrading the signals at the Spuyten Duyvil curve and several others in the system; it would also lower the speed limit going into the curve so that it would be a less-than-20-mph drop and thus the extra engineer would not be necessary.<ref name=\"MTA changes story\">{{cite news|title=Safety Upgrades Coming to Metro-North Derailment Site: MTA|url=http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Safety-Upgrades-MTA-Metro-North-Train-Derailment-Bronx-Spuyten-Duyvil-Curve-234987791.html|newspaper=[[WNBC-TV]]|date=December 8, 2013|accessdate=December 8, 2013}}</ref> U.S. Senators [[Richard Blumenthal]] of Connecticut and [[Charles Schumer]] of New York called on Metro-North to install cameras to monitor both the track and the engineers.<ref name=\"Senators call for cameras\">{{cite news|last=Castillo|first=Alfonso A.|title=Senators call for train cameras to monitor engineer, track|url=http://www.newsday.com/long-island/senators-call-for-train-cameras-to-monitor-engineer-track-1.6564959|newspaper=[[Newsday]]|date=December 8, 2013|accessdate=December 9, 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn December 12, the FRA went further.

{"title_page": "Noilly Prat", "text_new": "{{short description|Brand of French vermouth, now owned by Martini & Rossi}}\n[[Image:Vermouth.jpg|thumb|150px|right|A pre-2009 bottle of Noilly Prat]]\n'''Noilly Prat''' ({{IPA-fr|nwa.ji p\u0281at}}) is a [[brand]] of [[vermouth]] from France, owned by the Italian company [[Martini & Rossi]]. \"White\" Noilly Prat is the archetype of dry, straw-coloured French vermouth. Noilly Prat now makes Red and Ambre vermouths as well, introduced in the 1960s and 1980s, but they are less widely known. Noilly Prat Dry is 18% alcohol by volume. The Noilly Prat company is based in [[Marseillan, H\u00e9rault|Marseillan]], in the [[H\u00e9rault]] ''d\u00e9partement'' of southern [[France]], and is a subsidiary of [[Bacardi-Martini]]. Joseph Noilly, a herbalist, developed the first formula in 1813.\n\n==History==\nIt has long been known that leaving [[wine]] in a barrel alters its characteristics. Wine that was transported long distances in barrels and exposed to the weather became darker in colour and fuller-flavoured. It was to mimic this natural process that Joseph Noilly, in 1813, designed a process that made France's first vermouth. In 1855, his son Louis Noilly and son-in-law Claudius Prat set up the company that became Noilly Prat, moving the business to Marseillan where it remains to this day. The brand was acquired by its Italian competitor [[Martini & Rossi]] in 1971, which was merged into the [[Bacardi-Martini]] family of brands in 1992.\n\n==Manufacturing process==\n[[File:Noilly Prat Wine Barrels.JPG|thumb|right|Barrels for maturing the wine]]\nThe process used today is virtually unchanged since the 1850s. Noilly Prat is made exclusively from white grape varieties grown in the Marseillan area, principally ''[[Piquepoul|Picpoul de Pinet]]'' and ''[[Clairette blanche|Clairette]]''. These produce light, fruity wines which are matured in massive Canadian oak casks inside the original storerooms. The wine stays in these casks for 8 months, maturing and absorbing the flavour of the wood, before being transferred to smaller oak barrels which are taken outside and left for a year. Here they are exposed to the sun, wind, and low winter temperatures, while the wine is slowly changing. The result is a wine that is dry, full-bodied and amber coloured, similar to [[Madeira wine|Madeira]] or [[Sherry]]. During the year outside, 6 to 8% of the volume is lost to evaporation, the \"[[Angel's share|angels' share]]\".\n\nBrought back inside and left to rest for a few months, the wines are then blended together into oak casks. A small quantity of ''[[Mistelle]]'' (grape juice and alcohol) is added to the wines in order to soften them, along with a dash of fruit essence to accentuate their flavour.\n\nIn the oak casks, a process of ''[[maceration (wine)|maceration]]'', supposedly unique to Noilly Prat, takes place over a period of three weeks. A blend of some twenty herbs and spices is added by hand every day. The exact mix of herbs and spices that goes into Noilly Prat is a closely guarded secret, but includes [[camomile]], bitter [[Orange (fruit)|orange]] peel, [[nutmeg]], [[centaury]] (Yellow Gentian), [[coriander]], and [[cloves]]. After a further six weeks, the finished product is ready for bottling and is shipped in tankers to [[Beaucaire, Gard]], where it is bottled by [[Martini & Rossi]].\n\n==Variants==\nThe vast bulk of Noilly Prat wine is the Original French Dry vermouth. It is enjoyed as a chilled aperitif and in Martini Cocktails. However, three special variants have been made:\n\n*Red Noilly Prat is made in the same way, but with the addition of 30 flavourings, which produce the rich red colour. It is not sold in France, except from the Noilly Prat shop in Marseillan, being produced for export, principally to the USA.\n*Ambre Noilly Prat is available for purchase from the Noilly Prat shop in Marseillan and specialised stores.\n*(Colourless) Extra Dry Noilly Prat is a less complex wine formulated for the American extra-dry martini cocktail. Extra Dry is only shipped to North America, where it was available from 1979 until 2009. It returned late in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gray|first=Blake|title=Noilly Prat brings back US-only dry vermouth formula|url=http://blog.wblakegray.com/2012/06/noilly-prat-brings-back-us-only-formula.html}}</ref> It has supplanted the French Dry, which is now unavailable in much of the United States.{{cn|date=February 2017}}\n\n==Cocktails==\nNoilly Prat is often used in cocktails, the most common and well-known of which is probably the [[Martini (cocktail)|Martini]], consisting of one part Noilly Prat to one or more parts [[gin]] or [[vodka]], with a dash of [[orange bitters]], twist of lemon, or olive garnish. Over the years, the American preference for \"extra dry\" martinis led to the switch from gin to vodka, and to drastically reducing the flavour and quantity of the vermouth employed. However, in 2009, the extra-dry Noilly recipe exported to the USA was replaced by the original dry formula used worldwide. The change in recipe was accompanied by a change in the bottle's design.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123154573030469717\n | title = Don't Shoot the Messenger: Bad News for Martini Drinkers\n | first = Eric | last = Felten\n | work = [[Wall Street Journal]] | date = 10 January 2009\n}}</ref> Some recipes substituted a vermouth from Dolin instead of Noilly Prat for making martinis,<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://coudal.com/perfect.php\n | title = Perfect\n | first = Jim | last = Coudal\n}}</ref> which is said to be \"every bit as good as, although not by any means identical to, the old Noilly\".<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://coudal.com/archives/2010/12/perfect_remixed.php\n | title = Perfect Remixed\n | first = Jim | last = Coudal\n | date = 22 December 2010\n}}</ref>\n\nThe Algonquin cocktail, named after the [[Algonquin Hotel]], is composed of [[rye whiskey]], Noilly Prat and [[pineapple]] juice.<ref>{{cite news\n | last =Rose\n | first =Anthony\n | title =101 cocktails that shook the world #17: The Algonquin\n | work=The Independent\n |location = London\n | url =http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20050514/ai_n14627112\n | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20080505234032/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20050514/ai_n14627112\n | url-status =dead\n | archivedate =5 May 2008\n | accessdate =16 September 2007 }}</ref>\n\n==Cooking with Noilly Prat==\nNoilly Prat is widely used in cooking, and extensively used for sauces, especially to accompany fish.

Maul's tattoos are described as the markings of a warrior.{{efn|Earlier sources identified his body art as Sith markings.}} Talzin instructs [[Savage Opress]] to find his long-lost brother.\n\nIn the fourth season, Maul is revealed to be alive, having survived his presumed death at Obi-Wan's hands. Having ended up on a junkyard planet via a dumpster craft, Maul has suffered from amnesia since Obi-Wan defeated him. Savage finds Maul and brings him to the devastated Dathomir, where Talzin restores Maul's mind and gives him robotic legs.

Needing followers, they travel to [[Florrum]] and manage to convince [[Weequay]] pirate Jiro and his crew to join them and betray their leader [[Hondo Ohnaka]]. Maul's pirates attack Hondo's loyal forces, and Maul once again duels Obi-Wan while Savage fights and kills Jedi Master [[Adi Gallia]]. Obi-Wan draws the two brothers away from the pirates, engaging them in a duel. Obi-Wan, though outnumbered, cuts off Savage's arm. While Maul and Savage are in the process of retreating, Hondo's crew open fire at them and shoot off one of Maul's robotic legs. Maul's ship is blasted by a missile as it attempts to take flight, but Maul and Savage manage to escape using one of the emergency pods. After several days, they are found floating in dead space and close to death by the [[Mandalorian]] Death Watch warriors, led by [[Pre Vizsla]]. They are taken back to Vizsla's settlement, and Maul's damaged cybernetic legs are replaced with a new prosthetic that resembles a more humanoid form, while Savage is fitted with a mechanical arm. Maul offers Vizsla the chance to reclaim [[Mandalore]] by recruiting Black Sun, the Pyke Syndicate, and [[Jabba the Hutt]]'s minions to create the criminal syndicate named the Shadow Collective.\n\nFrom there, Maul engineers Vizsla's rise to power: he orders his henchmen to attack Mandalore so the Death Watch can arrest them and appear as heroes to the denizens who have long lived under Duchess [[Satine Kryze]]'s [[pacifist]] rule. Vizsla betrays Maul, imprisoning him and Savage. Easily breaking free, Maul challenges Vizsla to a duel to take over Death Watch and Mandalore; he succeeds in killing Vizsla and claims his former co-conspirator's [[darksaber (fictional weapon)|darksaber]]. He wins the loyalty of most Death Watch members, but Bo Katan retreats along with those loyal to their previous leader. Maul then puts disgraced former prime minister Almec, whom Satine had imprisoned for corruption, in power as a puppet leader, solidifying his control over Mandalore. Maul anticipates Satine's contacting the Jedi Council as part of his plan to get Obi-Wan to Mandalore. Once Obi-Wan arrives, Maul captures him and murders Satine in front of him, hoping to make the Jedi suffer as much as he once did. Obi-Wan is later freed by Katan's Death Watch faction.\n\nMaul senses Darth Sidious arriving on Mandalore. Although impressed with his former apprentice's survival, Sidious declares Maul a rival and uses the Force to push and choke him and Savage. He then engages them both in lightsaber combat, fatally injuring Savage. After Savage dies from his wounds, Sidious reminds Maul of the [[Star Wars: Darth Bane: Rule of Two|Rule of Two]], and tells him that he has been replaced. Enraged, Maul pulls out both his lightsaber and darksaber and proceeds to fight Sidious on equal ground, but Sidious ultimately defeats him. Maul pleads for mercy, but Sidious ignores him and tortures him with blasts of Force lightning. Sidious reveals that he has no intention of killing Maul, remarking that he has other uses for his former apprentice.\n\nMaul will return in season 7 in which he duels [[Ahsoka Tano]] during the Siege of Mandalore. He will be portrayed by Ray Park using [[motion capture]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/how-ray-park-and-the-mandalorian-are-upping-the-action-1834038997/amp|title=How Ray Park and The Mandalorian Are Upping the Action in Star Wars: The Clone Wars|last=Lussier|first=Germain|date=April 15, 2019|work=io9|accessdate=April 15, 2019}}</ref>\n\n====''Rebels''====\nAn older Maul appears in the season 2 finale of ''[[Star Wars Rebels]],''<ref name=\"Rebels\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/03/24/darth-maul-returns-star-wars-rebels|title='Star Wars: Rebels' resurrects a familiar old foe|website=Ew.com|accessdate=10 November 2017}}</ref> which takes place between ''Revenge of the Sith'' and ''[[A New Hope]]''. Tracked by an [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Imperial]] Inquisitor named the Eighth Brother, Maul is stranded on the ancient Sith world of [[Malachor]], where he is discovered among the ruins by series protagonist [[Ezra Bridger]]. Introducing himself as \"Old Master\" and seeking revenge against Sidious, Maul leads Ezra into an ancient Sith temple, where they discover a holocron that Maul claims can give them the knowledge needed to defeat the Sith. After recovering it, the two find Ezra's master [[Kanan Jarrus]] and former Jedi [[Ahsoka Tano]] locked in battle with the Eighth Brother. They also find the Inquisitors known as the Fifth Brother and the Seventh Sister, who have been pursuing the rebels for some time. Maul\u2014having cast aside the title of Darth\u2014reveals a new lightsaber disguised as a walking stick and joins the Jedi in battling their enemies, including Darth Vader.\n\nAfter the Inquisitors retreat, Maul wins the Jedi's trust by denouncing the Sith, and tells them that he cannot defeat Vader on his own. Working together, he and the Jedi ascend towards the top of the temple and successfully kill all three Inquisitors. Then, Maul reveals his intention to take Ezra as his apprentice, having already tricked him into activating the temple. After blinding Kanan, Maul briefly duels Ahsoka before facing Kanan again, only to be knocked off the temple's edge. However, he survives the fall and escapes Malachor in the Eighth Brother's [[TIE fighter]].\n\nMonths later, Maul takes the ''[[Ghost (Star Wars)|Ghost]]''{{'}}s crew hostage and threatens to kill them unless Kanan and Ezra bring both the Sith and Jedi holocrons to him. Maul takes the crew to a remote base in the Outer Rim where he awaits Kanan and Ezra's arrival. Then, the holocrons are hazardously united allowing Ezra and Maul to see visions of their desires: Ezra sees images of a way to destroy the Sith, images including \"twin suns\", while Maul sees a vision of his own. Kanan begs Ezra to look away before he sees too much of the dark side, while Maul tells him to ignore Kanan and keep looking. Ezra heeds his master's words and breaks off the connection, which causes a great explosion. Maul escapes in the confusion, uttering, \"He lives.\"\n\nMaul reappears after finding the rebels' secret base. He tells Ezra that because the connection was severed, they got bits and pieces of each other's visions. After the holocrons were destroyed, Maul discovered another way to get the information he needed. He travels to Dathomir with Ezra, and recreates a Nightsister spell to temporarily meld his and Ezra's minds. After this is completed, Ezra and Maul realize that they are both looking for Obi-Wan Kenobi.\n\nIn the episode \"Twin Suns\", Maul is shown lost on Tatooine. He decides to use Ezra to lure Obi-Wan out of hiding. His plan is ultimately successful as he tracks Ezra through the desert and the latter is rescued by Obi-Wan. Maul then comes face to face with his nemesis who ushered Ezra away. During their confrontation, Maul deduces that Obi-Wan is not only hiding, but is protecting [[Luke Skywalker|someone]]. Obi-Wan realizes Maul has to die and ignites his lightsaber. In a swift duel, Obi-Wan fatally wounds Maul. As he lies dying in Obi-Wan's arms, Maul asks if the person he is protecting is the [[Chosen One (Star Wars)|Chosen One]], and Obi-Wan (implying Luke as Anakin has since become Vader) replies that he is. Maul declares that this \"Chosen One\" will avenge them and dies.\n\n===Comics===\n{{Expand section|date=June 2019}}\n\n====''Darth Maul''====\nIn 2017, [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] released ''Star Wars: Darth Maul'' a 5-issue prequel series centered on Darth Maul before the events of ''The Phantom Menace''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Juba |first=Joe |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2016/11/14/darth-maul-to-star-in-new-comic-book.aspx |title=Darth Maul To Star In New Star Wars Comic Book - News |publisher=www.GameInformer.com |date=2016-11-14 |accessdate=2016-12-19}}</ref>\n\n====''Darth Maul: Son of Dathomir''====\n[[Dark Horse Comics]] produced ''[[Darth Maul: Son of Dathomir]]'' based on the scripts and storyboards of an unproduced 4-episode story arc intended for ''The Clone Wars'' Season 7.

Prime Minister Almec arranges Maul's escape and the latter then heads back to Zanbar to command the Death Watch army. However, he is followed by [[General Grievous]] and his droids, who battle with Maul and the Mandalorians. While they put up a fierce fight, Maul and his minions are ultimately overwhelmed by the droids. During the battle, Maul tears through the droid ranks and attacks Grievous, but is overpowered and forced to retreat. Afterwards, Maul confers with Mother Talzin (revealed to be his biological mother) and plots to draw out Sidious by capturing Dooku and Grievous. The scheme works, and Talzin is able to restore herself to her physical form, but she sacrifices herself to save Maul. Although Maul escapes with a company of loyal Mandalorians, the Shadow Collective has disintegrated due to the conflict with Sidious, as the Hutts, Pykes, and Black Sun have all abandoned Maul.\n\n===Novels===\n====''Ahsoka''====\nIn flashbacks during the novel ''[[Star Wars: Ahsoka]]'', it is revealed that during the final days of the Clone Wars, Maul and his forces were besieged on Mandalore by an army of clone troopers led by Ahsoka Tano and [[Captain Rex]].{{efn|Anakin and Obi-Wan were dispatched to Mandalore with Ahsoka, but were immediately called back to Coruscant to rescue Chancellor [[Palpatine]], thus leading into the opening sequence of ''Revenge of the Sith''.}} During the siege, Maul confronts and duels Ahsoka, and though he proves to be the stronger fighter, the former Jedi outwits him and traps him in a ray shield.

The series is set in the shortly before the Battle of Naboo in ''Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace''.  The story follows Maul in his mission to destroy the leadership of the well-feared crime syndicate Black Sun. Maul spends his time serving under Darth Sidious, killing countlessly. His main target in the series is the leader of Black Sun, some time before [[Prince Xizor]] takes command of it.\n\nSeveral sources depict Maul returning from the dead in several different forms. The story \"Resurrection\" from [[Star Wars Tales 9|''Star Wars Tales'' #9]] depicts a cult creating a duplicate of Maul as a replacement for Darth Vader, only for Vader to kill him. The story ''Phantom Menaces'' in [[Star Wars Tales 17|''Star Wars Tales'' #17]] (set after ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'') depicts Luke Skywalker visiting Maul's home planet of [[Iridonia]] in an ambassadorial capacity, where he faces a \"solid state hologram\" of Maul projected from Maul's salvaged brain as part of a scientist's attempt to recreate Maul as Iridonia's \"champion\". Luke recognizes the disruption that Maul's existence is causing in the Force, and shuts down the life-support systems keeping the brain alive.\n\nIn 2005, Dark Horse Comics published ''[[Star Wars: Visionaries]]'', a compilation of non-canonical short comics made by the creators of ''Revenge of the Sith''. One story, \"Old Wounds\", depicts Maul with longer horns on his head, having survived his bisection at Obi-Wan's hands, with his missing bottom half replaced with [[cybernetic]] legs, similar to those of General Grievous (and his eventual revival in ''The Clone Wars''). He follows Obi-Wan throughout the galaxy, finally tracking him down on Tatooine a few years after the events of ''Revenge of the Sith''. Maul taunts Obi-Wan, saying that after he kills him, he will take a toddler-aged Luke Skywalker to his master, Emperor Palpatine. Maul plans to kill Vader and resume his rightful place at Palpatine's side. He ignites his new double-bladed lightsaber and engages Obi-Wan in a duel, but Obi-Wan again bests him in combat, cutting off his opponent's horns. Maul is killed by a blaster bolt to the head from [[Owen Lars]]. Obi-Wan thanks Owen, and says he will take Maul's body into the desert and burn it.\n\n====Novels====\nIn early 2012, a [[young adult fiction|young adult]] novel entitled ''Star Wars: The Wrath of Darth Maul'' was released by [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic]]. Maul is also featured prominently in comic series starting in this period, ''The Clone Wars: The Sith Hunters'' and ''Darth Maul: Death Sentence''. Set around the various episodes of ''The Clone Wars'' that featured Maul, the two books detail his and Savage Opress' journey across the galaxy as they seek vengeance on the Jedi.\n\nIn the 2012 novel ''[[Star Wars: Darth Plagueis|Darth Plagueis]]'', the titular Sith lord sends his apprentice, Darth Sidious, to the Force-rich world of Dathomir. A Dathomiri witch, or Nightsister, senses Sidious' power in the Force and approaches him. Assuming he is a Jedi, she begs him to take her [[Zabrak (Star Wars)|Zabrak]] infant son. She realizes that Sidious is not a Jedi, and explains how she is trying to save her son from a Nightsister named Talzin, who killed Maul's father. It is implied that Maul has a twin brother and that Talzin is only aware of one child. Sidious realizes the infant is strong in the Force, and would become a threat if found by the Jedi. Concealing the existence of his own master, Sidious raises Maul to believe that he is a Sith apprentice, but he actually intends him to be an expendable minion rather than an heir. Maul himself acknowledges his shortcomings, such as his limited understanding of politics, even as he tries to become a true Sith.\n\n=====''Darth Maul: Shadow Hunter''=====\n'''''Darth Maul: Shadow Hunter''''' is a novel by [[Michael Reaves]] released on February 1, 2001. It is a prequel novel occurring about six months before the events of ''The Phantom Menace''. The cover art was by David Stevenson. [[Del Rey Books|Del Rey]] aired a TV commercial for the novel in 1999.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} As portrayed in the novel, Maul was raised by Sidious for as long as he can remember. Sidious then trains Maul as a Sith, marking his body with Sith tattoos. Maul initially goes on several missions of [[terrorism|terror]] for his master, killing politicians, crime bosses, merchants and warlords.\n\nSidious meets secretly with his [[Neimoidian]] contacts in the Trade Federation to finalize details in the plan to blockade Naboo. One member of the delegation is missing; suspecting betrayal, Sidious orders Maul to hunt down the traitor. Maul completes this task, but learns that the traitor had recorded proof of the Sith's manipulation of the Naboo blockade on a holocron to sell for profit. A [[suicide terrorism|suicidal]] attack by a Trade Federation-hired [[bounty hunter]] interferes with Maul's plan and the holocron is purchased by a [[Corellia]]n con man named Lorn Pavan.\nPavan realizes the nature of the information and seeks to take it to the [[Jedi Temple]]. Maul, for his part, is ordered by Sidious to retrieve the holocron and kill Pavan and anyone else who might have the information.  Meanwhile, a Jedi Padawan named Darsha Assant is faced with the Jedi trials to become a full-fledged Jedi Knight, and tries to save a member of Black Sun (which Maul had crippled in ''Saboteur'').\n\nPavan attempts to do business with a Hutt crime lord in one of the lower levels in Coruscant, but Maul arrives and kills the Hutt. Pavan escapes into the caverns where they meet Darsha and her master. The Jedi begin escorting Pavan and his droid to the temple but Maul soon attacks them. Darsha's master is slain while attempting to buy time for the others. Pavan and Darsha escape various dangers of Coruscant's subterranean levels before finding themselves in another battle.  Darsha, realizing that she cannot defeat Maul, draws out their duel long enough for Pavan's droid to repair a carbonite-freezing unit and seal Pavan and the droid inside it.  Darsha plunges her lightsaber into a pile of volatile gas canisters, killing her and causing an explosion that Maul barely escapes.  Upon surveying the scene, Maul feels no trace of Pavan in the Force, not realizing that the [[Carbonite (Star Wars)|carbonite]] [[hibernation]] has made his lifeforce undetectable.\n\nAn automatic timer frees Pavan from hibernation and he goes after Maul on his own.  Pavan follows Maul to a Republic space station and sneaks up on Maul, stunning him momentarily before he awakens, severes Pavan's right hand, and pursues him through the station's service tubes.\nPavan barely makes it into a public area where Maul cannot follow, and unwittingly gives the holocron to Senator Palpatine of Naboo, not realizing that Palpatine is Maul's Sith Master. After recovering, Pavan starts to leave his quarters, only to be confronted by Maul, who kills him as a worthy opponent.\n\n=====''Darth Maul: Saboteur''=====\n'''''Darth Maul: Saboteur''''' is a short story by [[James Luceno]].

While [[Anakin Skywalker]] ([[Jake Lloyd]]) gets on board, Qui-Gon engages Maul in a lightsaber duel, but the Jedi master escapes. Eventually, Maul fights Qui-Gon and [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] ([[Ewan McGregor]]) simultaneously. Maul duels Qui-Gon and eventually kills him.

Maul commands her to meet with him on [[Dathomir]] and tells her that they will work more closely from now on, igniting his lightsaber.\n\n===Animated series===\n==== ''The Clone Wars'' ====\nDarth Maul's origins are elaborated upon in the third season of the animated series ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'', which takes place between ''[[Attack of the Clones]]'' and ''[[Revenge of the Sith]]''.\nMaul is explained to have been a warrior of the Nightbrother clan on the planet [[Dathomir]] inhabited by the dominant Nightsister [[witchcraft]] society led by [[Mother Talzin]]. Maul's tattoos are described as the markings of a warrior.{{efn|Earlier sources identified his body art as Sith markings.}} Talzin instructs [[Savage Opress]] to find his long-lost brother.\n\nIn the fourth season, Maul is revealed to be alive, having survived his presumed death at Obi-Wan's hands. Having ended up on a junkyard planet via a dumpster craft, Maul has suffered from amnesia since Obi-Wan defeated him. Savage finds Maul and brings him to the devastated Dathomir, where Talzin restores Maul's mind and gives him robotic legs.

Needing followers, they travel to [[Florrum]] and manage to convince [[Weequay]] pirate Jiro and his crew to join them and betray their leader [[Hondo Ohnaka]]. Maul's pirates attack Hondo's loyal forces, and Maul once again duels Obi-Wan while Savage fights and kills Jedi Master [[Adi Gallia]]. Obi-Wan draws the two brothers away from the pirates, engaging them in a duel. Obi-Wan, though outnumbered, cuts off Savage's arm. While Maul and Savage are in the process of retreating, Hondo's crew open fire at them and shoot off one of Maul's robotic legs. Maul's ship is blasted by a missile as it attempts to take flight, but Maul and Savage manage to escape using one of the emergency pods. After several days, they are found floating in dead space and close to death by the [[Mandalorian]] Death Watch warriors, led by [[Pre Vizsla]]. They are taken back to Vizsla's settlement, and Maul's damaged cybernetic legs are replaced with a new prosthetic that resembles a more humanoid form, while Savage is fitted with a mechanical arm. Maul offers Vizsla the chance to reclaim [[Mandalore]] by recruiting Black Sun, the Pyke Syndicate, and [[Jabba the Hutt]]'s minions to create the criminal syndicate named the Shadow Collective.\n\nFrom there, Maul engineers Vizsla's rise to power: he orders his henchmen to attack Mandalore so the Death Watch can arrest them and appear as heroes to the denizens who have long lived under Duchess [[Satine Kryze]]'s [[pacifist]] rule. Vizsla betrays Maul, imprisoning him and Savage. Easily breaking free, Maul challenges Vizsla to a duel to take over Death Watch and Mandalore; he succeeds in killing Vizsla and claims his former co-conspirator's [[darksaber (fictional weapon)|darksaber]]. He wins the loyalty of most Death Watch members, but Bo Katan retreats along with those loyal to their previous leader. Maul then puts disgraced former prime minister Almec, whom Satine had imprisoned for corruption, in power as a puppet leader, solidifying his control over Mandalore. Maul anticipates Satine's contacting the Jedi Council as part of his plan to get Obi-Wan to Mandalore. Once Obi-Wan arrives, Maul captures him and murders Satine in front of him, hoping to make the Jedi suffer as much as he once did. Obi-Wan is later freed by Katan's Death Watch faction.\n\nMaul senses Darth Sidious arriving on Mandalore. Although impressed with his former apprentice's survival, Sidious declares Maul a rival and uses the Force to push and choke him and Savage. He then engages them both in lightsaber combat, fatally injuring Savage. After Savage dies from his wounds, Sidious reminds Maul of the [[Star Wars: Darth Bane: Rule of Two|Rule of Two]], and tells him that he has been replaced. Enraged, Maul pulls out both his lightsaber and darksaber and proceeds to fight Sidious on equal ground, but Sidious ultimately defeats him. Maul pleads for mercy, but Sidious ignores him and tortures him with blasts of Force lightning. Sidious reveals that he has no intention of killing Maul, remarking that he has other uses for his former apprentice.\n\nMaul will return in season 7 in which he duels [[Ahsoka Tano]] during the Siege of Mandalore. He will be portrayed by Ray Park using [[motion capture]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/how-ray-park-and-the-mandalorian-are-upping-the-action-1834038997/amp|title=How Ray Park and The Mandalorian Are Upping the Action in Star Wars: The Clone Wars|last=Lussier|first=Germain|date=April 15, 2019|work=io9|accessdate=April 15, 2019}}</ref>\n\n====''Rebels''====\nAn older Maul appears in the season 2 finale of ''[[Star Wars Rebels]],''<ref name=\"Rebels\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/03/24/darth-maul-returns-star-wars-rebels|title='Star Wars: Rebels' resurrects a familiar old foe|website=Ew.com|accessdate=10 November 2017}}</ref> which takes place between ''Revenge of the Sith'' and ''[[A New Hope]]''. Tracked by an [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Imperial]] Inquisitor named the Eighth Brother, Maul is stranded on the ancient Sith world of [[Malachor]], where he is discovered among the ruins by series protagonist [[Ezra Bridger]]. Introducing himself as \"Old Master\" and seeking revenge against Sidious, Maul leads Ezra into an ancient Sith temple, where they discover a holocron that Maul claims can give them the knowledge needed to defeat the Sith. After recovering it, the two find Ezra's master [[Kanan Jarrus]] and former Jedi [[Ahsoka Tano]] locked in battle with the Eighth Brother. They also find the Inquisitors known as the Fifth Brother and the Seventh Sister, who have been pursuing the rebels for some time. Maul\u2014having cast aside the title of Darth\u2014reveals a new lightsaber disguised as a walking stick and joins the Jedi in battling their enemies, including Darth Vader.\n\nAfter the Inquisitors retreat, Maul wins the Jedi's trust by denouncing the Sith, and tells them that he cannot defeat Vader on his own. Working together, he and the Jedi ascend towards the top of the temple and successfully kill all three Inquisitors. Then, Maul reveals his intention to take Ezra as his apprentice, having already tricked him into activating the temple. After blinding Kanan, Maul briefly duels Ahsoka before facing Kanan again, only to be knocked off the temple's edge. However, he survives the fall and escapes Malachor in the Eighth Brother's [[TIE fighter]].\n\nMonths later, Maul takes the ''[[Ghost (Star Wars)|Ghost]]''{{'}}s crew hostage and threatens to kill them unless Kanan and Ezra bring both the Sith and Jedi holocrons to him. Maul takes the crew to a remote base in the Outer Rim where he awaits Kanan and Ezra's arrival. Then, the holocrons are hazardously united allowing Ezra and Maul to see visions of their desires: Ezra sees images of a way to destroy the Sith, images including \"twin suns\", while Maul sees a vision of his own. Kanan begs Ezra to look away before he sees too much of the dark side, while Maul tells him to ignore Kanan and keep looking. Ezra heeds his master's words and breaks off the connection, which causes a great explosion. Maul escapes in the confusion, uttering, \"He lives.\"\n\nMaul reappears after finding the rebels' secret base. He tells Ezra that because the connection was severed, they got bits and pieces of each other's visions. After the holocrons were destroyed, Maul discovered another way to get the information he needed. He travels to Dathomir with Ezra, and recreates a Nightsister spell to temporarily meld his and Ezra's minds. After this is completed, Ezra and Maul realize that they are both looking for Obi-Wan Kenobi.\n\nIn the episode \"Twin Suns\", Maul is shown lost on Tatooine. He decides to use Ezra to lure Obi-Wan out of hiding. His plan is ultimately successful as he tracks Ezra through the desert and the latter is rescued by Obi-Wan. Maul then comes face to face with his nemesis who ushered Ezra away. During their confrontation, Maul deduces that Obi-Wan is not only hiding, but is protecting [[Luke Skywalker|someone]]. Obi-Wan realizes Maul has to die and ignites his lightsaber. In a swift duel, Obi-Wan fatally wounds Maul. As he lies dying in Obi-Wan's arms, Maul asks if the person he is protecting is the [[Chosen One (Star Wars)|Chosen One]], and Obi-Wan (implying Luke as Anakin has since become Vader) replies that he is. Maul declares that this \"Chosen One\" will avenge them and dies.\n\n===Comics===\n{{Expand section|date=June 2019}}\n\n====''Darth Maul''====\nIn 2017, [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] released ''Star Wars: Darth Maul'' a 5-issue prequel series centered on Darth Maul before the events of ''The Phantom Menace''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Juba |first=Joe |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2016/11/14/darth-maul-to-star-in-new-comic-book.aspx |title=Darth Maul To Star In New Star Wars Comic Book - News |publisher=www.GameInformer.com |date=2016-11-14 |accessdate=2016-12-19}}</ref>\n\n====''Darth Maul: Son of Dathomir''====\n[[Dark Horse Comics]] produced ''[[Darth Maul: Son of Dathomir]]'' based on the scripts and storyboards of an unproduced 4-episode story arc intended for ''The Clone Wars'' Season 7. After killing Savage Opress, Darth Sidious takes Maul to a Separatist prison, where [[Count Dooku]] tortures him for information about the Shadow Collective. Prime Minister Almec arranges Maul's escape and the latter then heads back to Zanbar to command the Death Watch army. However, he is followed by [[General Grievous]] and his droids, who battle with Maul and the Mandalorians. While they put up a fierce fight, Maul and his minions are ultimately overwhelmed by the droids. During the battle, Maul tears through the droid ranks and attacks Grievous, but is overpowered and forced to retreat. Afterwards, Maul confers with Mother Talzin (revealed to be his biological mother) and plots to draw out Sidious by capturing Dooku and Grievous. The scheme works, and Talzin is able to restore herself to her physical form, but she sacrifices herself to save Maul. Although Maul escapes with a company of loyal Mandalorians, the Shadow Collective has disintegrated due to the conflict with Sidious, as the Hutts, Pykes, and Black Sun have all abandoned Maul.\n\n===Novels===\n====''Ahsoka''====\nIn flashbacks during the novel ''[[Star Wars: Ahsoka]]'', it is revealed that during the final days of the Clone Wars, Maul and his forces were besieged on Mandalore by an army of clone troopers led by Ahsoka Tano and [[Captain Rex]].{{efn|Anakin and Obi-Wan were dispatched to Mandalore with Ahsoka, but were immediately called back to Coruscant to rescue Chancellor [[Palpatine]], thus leading into the opening sequence of ''Revenge of the Sith''.}} During the siege, Maul confronts and duels Ahsoka, and though he proves to be the stronger fighter, the former Jedi outwits him and traps him in a ray shield. However, before Maul can be taken into official custody, [[Order 66 (Star Wars)|Order 66]] is enacted and the clone troopers following Ahsoka turn on her, with the exception of Rex. With Rex's life in peril, Ahsoka abandons the chance of killing Maul, allowing the former Sith to escape once again.

The series is set in the shortly before the Battle of Naboo in ''Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace''.  The story follows Maul in his mission to destroy the leadership of the well-feared crime syndicate Black Sun. Maul spends his time serving under Darth Sidious, killing countlessly. His main target in the series is the leader of Black Sun, some time before [[Prince Xizor]] takes command of it.\n\nSeveral sources depict Maul returning from the dead in several different forms. The story \"Resurrection\" from [[Star Wars Tales 9|''Star Wars Tales'' #9]] depicts a cult creating a duplicate of Maul as a replacement for Darth Vader, only for Vader to kill him. The story ''Phantom Menaces'' in [[Star Wars Tales 17|''Star Wars Tales'' #17]] (set after ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'') depicts Luke Skywalker visiting Maul's home planet of [[Iridonia]] in an ambassadorial capacity, where he faces a \"solid state hologram\" of Maul projected from Maul's salvaged brain as part of a scientist's attempt to recreate Maul as Iridonia's \"champion\". Luke recognizes the disruption that Maul's existence is causing in the Force, and shuts down the life-support systems keeping the brain alive.\n\nIn 2005, Dark Horse Comics published ''[[Star Wars: Visionaries]]'', a compilation of non-canonical short comics made by the creators of ''Revenge of the Sith''. One story, \"Old Wounds\", depicts Maul with longer horns on his head, having survived his bisection at Obi-Wan's hands, with his missing bottom half replaced with [[cybernetic]] legs, similar to those of General Grievous (and his eventual revival in ''The Clone Wars''). He follows Obi-Wan throughout the galaxy, finally tracking him down on Tatooine a few years after the events of ''Revenge of the Sith''. Maul taunts Obi-Wan, saying that after he kills him, he will take a toddler-aged Luke Skywalker to his master, Emperor Palpatine. Maul plans to kill Vader and resume his rightful place at Palpatine's side. He ignites his new double-bladed lightsaber and engages Obi-Wan in a duel, but Obi-Wan again bests him in combat, cutting off his opponent's horns. Maul is killed by a blaster bolt to the head from [[Owen Lars]]. Obi-Wan thanks Owen, and says he will take Maul's body into the desert and burn it.\n\n====Novels====\nIn early 2012, a [[young adult fiction|young adult]] novel entitled ''Star Wars: The Wrath of Darth Maul'' was released by [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic]]. Maul is also featured prominently in comic series starting in this period, ''The Clone Wars: The Sith Hunters'' and ''Darth Maul: Death Sentence''. Set around the various episodes of ''The Clone Wars'' that featured Maul, the two books detail his and Savage Opress' journey across the galaxy as they seek vengeance on the Jedi.\n\nIn the 2012 novel ''[[Star Wars: Darth Plagueis|Darth Plagueis]]'', the titular Sith lord sends his apprentice, Darth Sidious, to the Force-rich world of Dathomir. A Dathomiri witch, or Nightsister, senses Sidious' power in the Force and approaches him. Assuming he is a Jedi, she begs him to take her [[Zabrak (Star Wars)|Zabrak]] infant son. She realizes that Sidious is not a Jedi, and explains how she is trying to save her son from a Nightsister named Talzin, who killed Maul's father. It is implied that Maul has a twin brother and that Talzin is only aware of one child. Sidious realizes the infant is strong in the Force, and would become a threat if found by the Jedi. Concealing the existence of his own master, Sidious raises Maul to believe that he is a Sith apprentice, but he actually intends him to be an expendable minion rather than an heir. Maul himself acknowledges his shortcomings, such as his limited understanding of politics, even as he tries to become a true Sith.\n\n=====''Darth Maul: Shadow Hunter''=====\n'''''Darth Maul: Shadow Hunter''''' is a novel by [[Michael Reaves]] released on February 1, 2001. It is a prequel novel occurring about six months before the events of ''The Phantom Menace''. The cover art was by David Stevenson. [[Del Rey Books|Del Rey]] aired a TV commercial for the novel in 1999.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} As portrayed in the novel, Maul was raised by Sidious for as long as he can remember. Sidious then trains Maul as a Sith, marking his body with Sith tattoos. Maul initially goes on several missions of [[terrorism|terror]] for his master, killing politicians, crime bosses, merchants and warlords.\n\nSidious meets secretly with his [[Neimoidian]] contacts in the Trade Federation to finalize details in the plan to blockade Naboo. One member of the delegation is missing; suspecting betrayal, Sidious orders Maul to hunt down the traitor. Maul completes this task, but learns that the traitor had recorded proof of the Sith's manipulation of the Naboo blockade on a holocron to sell for profit. A [[suicide terrorism|suicidal]] attack by a Trade Federation-hired [[bounty hunter]] interferes with Maul's plan and the holocron is purchased by a [[Corellia]]n con man named Lorn Pavan.\nPavan realizes the nature of the information and seeks to take it to the [[Jedi Temple]]. Maul, for his part, is ordered by Sidious to retrieve the holocron and kill Pavan and anyone else who might have the information.  Meanwhile, a Jedi Padawan named Darsha Assant is faced with the Jedi trials to become a full-fledged Jedi Knight, and tries to save a member of Black Sun (which Maul had crippled in ''Saboteur'').\n\nPavan attempts to do business with a Hutt crime lord in one of the lower levels in Coruscant, but Maul arrives and kills the Hutt. Pavan escapes into the caverns where they meet Darsha and her master. The Jedi begin escorting Pavan and his droid to the temple but Maul soon attacks them. Darsha's master is slain while attempting to buy time for the others. Pavan and Darsha escape various dangers of Coruscant's subterranean levels before finding themselves in another battle.  Darsha, realizing that she cannot defeat Maul, draws out their duel long enough for Pavan's droid to repair a carbonite-freezing unit and seal Pavan and the droid inside it.  Darsha plunges her lightsaber into a pile of volatile gas canisters, killing her and causing an explosion that Maul barely escapes.  Upon surveying the scene, Maul feels no trace of Pavan in the Force, not realizing that the [[Carbonite (Star Wars)|carbonite]] [[hibernation]] has made his lifeforce undetectable.\n\nAn automatic timer frees Pavan from hibernation and he goes after Maul on his own.  Pavan follows Maul to a Republic space station and sneaks up on Maul, stunning him momentarily before he awakens, severes Pavan's right hand, and pursues him through the station's service tubes.\nPavan barely makes it into a public area where Maul cannot follow, and unwittingly gives the holocron to Senator Palpatine of Naboo, not realizing that Palpatine is Maul's Sith Master. After recovering, Pavan starts to leave his quarters, only to be confronted by Maul, who kills him as a worthy opponent.\n\n=====''Darth Maul: Saboteur''=====\n'''''Darth Maul: Saboteur''''' is a short story by [[James Luceno]]. It was released in [[ebook]] form, with a length equivalent to about 55 printed pages, on February 1, 2001.\nIt was also published in the back of the paperback edition of Michael Reaves' ''Darth Maul: Shadow Hunter''.\n\nThe story is about Darth Maul and takes place roughly a year before ''The Phantom Menace''.

He is widely considered one of the most important and influential [[20th-century classical music|composers of the 20th century]].\n\nStravinsky's compositional career was notable for its stylistic diversity. He first achieved international fame with three ballets commissioned by the [[impresario]] [[Serge Diaghilev]] and first performed in Paris by Diaghilev's [[Ballets Russes]]: ''[[The Firebird]]'' (1910), ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]'' (1911), and ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' (1913). The latter transformed the way in which subsequent composers thought about rhythmic structure and was largely responsible for Stravinsky's enduring reputation as a musical revolutionary who pushed the boundaries of musical design. His \"Russian phase\", which continued with works such as ''[[Renard (Stravinsky)|Renard]]'', ''[[L'Histoire du soldat]]'' and ''[[Les Noces]]'', was followed in the 1920s by a period in which he turned to [[Neoclassicism (music)|neoclassicism]]. The works from this period tended to make use of traditional musical forms ([[concerto grosso]], [[fugue]] and [[symphony]]) and drew from earlier styles, especially those of the 18th century. In the 1950s, Stravinsky adopted [[serialism|serial]] procedures. His compositions of this period shared traits with examples of his earlier output: rhythmic energy, the construction of extended melodic ideas out of a few two- or three-note [[Cell (music)|cells]] and clarity of [[Musical form|form]], and of [[instrumentation (music)|instrumentation]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life, 1882\u20131901===\nStravinsky was born on 17 June 1882 in the town of [[Lomonosov, Russia|Oranienbaum]] on the southern coast of the [[Gulf of Finland]], situated 25 miles west of [[Saint Petersburg]].{{sfn|Greene|1985|p=1101}}{{sfn|White|1979|p=4}} His father, [[Fyodor Stravinsky|Fyodor Ignatievich Stravinsky]] (1843\u20131902), was an established [[Bass (voice type)|bass]] opera singer in the [[National Opera of Ukraine|Kyiv Opera]] and the [[Mariinsky Theatre]] in Saint Petersburg and his mother, Anna Kirillovna Stravinskaya (''n\u00e9e'' Kholodovskaya; 1854\u20131939), a native of [[Kiev]], was one of four daughters of a high-ranking official in the Kiev Ministry of Estates.

Rimsky-Korsakov, arguably the leading Russian composer at this time, suggested to Stravinsky that he should not enter the [[Saint Petersburg Conservatory]] but continue private lessons in theory.{{sfn|White|1979|p=8}}\n\nBy the time of his father's death from cancer in 1902, Stravinsky was spending more time studying music than law.{{sfn|Palmer|1982}} His decision to pursue music full time was helped when the university was closed for two months in 1905 in the aftermath of [[Bloody Sunday (1905)|Bloody Sunday]], which prevented him from taking his final law exams.

In February of that year, both were performed in Saint Petersburg at a concert that marked a turning point in Stravinsky's career. In the audience was [[Serge Diaghilev]], a Russian impresario and owner of the [[Ballets Russes]] who was struck with Stravinsky's compositions. He wished to stage a mix of Russian opera and ballet for the 1910 season in Paris, among them a new ballet from fresh talent that was based on the Russian fairytale of the [[Firebird (Slavic folklore)|Firebird]].{{sfn|White|1979|p=15}} After [[Anatoly Liadov]] was given the task of composing the score, he informed Diaghilev that he needed about one year to complete it.{{sfn|White|1979|p=16}} Diaghilev then asked the 28-year-old Stravinsky, who had provided satisfactory orchestrations for him for the previous season at short notice and agreed to compose a full score.{{sfn|White|1979|p=15}} At 50 minutes in length, ''[[The Firebird]]'' was revised by Stravinsky for concert performance in 1911, 1919, and 1945.\n\n''The Firebird'' premiered at the [[Palais Garnier|Opera de Paris]] on 25 June 1910 to widespread critical acclaim and Stravinsky became an overnight sensation.{{sfn|Walsh|2000|pp=142\u201343}}{{sfn|Walsh|2000|p=140}}{{sfn|Whiting|2005|p=30}} As his wife was expecting their third child, the Stravinskys spent the summer in [[La Baule-Escoublac|La Baule]] in western France.

The result was ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]'', based the Russian folk tale featuring the [[Petrushka|titular character]], a puppet, who falls in love with another, a ballerina. Though it failed to capture the immediate reception that ''The Firebird'' had following its premiere at [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet]] in June 1911, the production continued Stravinsky's success.\n\nIt was Stravinsky's third ballet for Diaghilev, ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'', that caused a sensation among critics, fellow composers, and concertgoers. Based on an original idea, the production features a series of primitive rituals celebrating the advent of spring, after which a young girl is chosen as a sacrificial victim and dances herself to death. Stravinsky's score contained many novel features for its time, including experiments in tonality, metre, rhythm, stress and dissonance. The radical nature of the music and choreography caused a near-riot at its premiere at the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]] on 29 May 1913.\n\nShortly after the premiere, Stravinsky contracted [[typhoid]] from eating bad oysters and he was confined to a Paris nursing home. He left in July 1913 and returned to Ustilug.{{sfn|V.

Stravinsky and Craft|1978|pp=111\u201314}} On 15 January 1914, Stravinsky and Nosenko had their fourth child, Marie Mil\u00e8ne (or Maria Milena). After her delivery, Nosenko was discovered to have [[tuberculosis]] and was confined to a [[sanatorium]] in [[Leysin]] in the Alps. Stravinsky took up residence nearby, where he completed ''The Nightingale''.{{sfn|Walsh|2000|p=224}}{{sfn|V.

This is where notes are subtracted or added to a motif without regard to the consequent changes in metre. A similar technique can be found as early as the 16th century, for example in the music of [[Cipriano de Rore]], [[Orlande de Lassus|Orlandus Lassus]], [[Carlo Gesualdo]] and [[Giovanni de Macque]], music with which Stravinsky exhibited considerable familiarity.{{sfn|Stravinsky and Craft|1960|pp=116\u201317}}\n\nThe ''Rite of Spring'' is notable for its relentless use of [[ostinato|ostinati]], for example in the eighth-note ostinato on strings accented by eight [[French horn|horns]] in the section \"Augurs of Spring (Dances of the Young Girls)\". The work also contains passages where several ostinati clash against one another. Stravinsky was noted for his distinctive use of rhythm, especially in the ''Rite of Spring'' (1913).{{sfn|Simon|2007}} According to the composer [[Philip Glass]], \"the idea of pushing the rhythms across the bar lines [...] led the way [...].

Practically the whole lot are already on the shelf, and they will remain there until a few jaded neurotics once more feel a desire to eat ashes and fill their belly with the east wind.<ref>\"Occasional Notes\", ''[[The Musical Times and Singing-Class Circular]]'' 64, no. 968 (1 October 1923): 712\u201315, quotation on 713.</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:RIAN archive 597702 Composer Igor Stravinsky and cellist Mstislav Rostropovich.jpg|thumb|upright|Stravinsky with [[Mstislav Rostropovich]] in Moscow in September 1962]]\nIn 1935, the American composer [[Marc Blitzstein]] compared Stravinsky to [[Jacopo Peri]] and [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach|C.P.E. Bach]], conceding that, \"there is no denying the greatness of Stravinsky. It is just that he is not great enough.\"{{sfn|Blitzstein|1935|p=330}} Blitzstein's [[Marxism|Marxist]] position was that Stravinsky's wish to \"divorce music from other streams of life\", which is \"symptomatic of an escape from reality\", resulted in a \"loss of stamina\", naming specifically ''[[Apollo (ballet)|Apollo]]'', the [[Capriccio for Piano and Orchestra|Capriccio]], and ''[[Le baiser de la f\u00e9e|Le Baiser de la f\u00e9e]]''.{{sfn|Blitzstein|1935|pp=346\u201347}}\n\nThe composer [[Constant Lambert]] described pieces such as ''[[L'Histoire du soldat]]'' as containing \"essentially cold-blooded abstraction\".{{sfn|Lambert|1936|p=94}} Lambert continued, \"melodic fragments in {{lang|fr|Histoire du Soldat}} are completely meaningless themselves. They are merely successions of notes that can conveniently be divided into groups of three, five, and seven and set against other mathematical groups\" and he described the cadenza for solo drums as \"musical purity ... achieved by a species of musical castration\". He compared Stravinsky's choice of \"the drabbest and least significant phrases\" to [[Gertrude Stein]]'s 'Everyday they were gay there, they were regularly gay there everyday' (\"Helen Furr and Georgine Skeene\", 1922), \"whose effect would be equally appreciated by someone with no knowledge of English whatsoever\".{{sfn|Lambert|1936|pp=101\u201305}}\n\nIn his 1949 book ''Philosophy of Modern Music'', [[Theodor W. Adorno]] described Stravinsky as an acrobat and spoke of [[Disorganized schizophrenia|hebephrenic]] and psychotic traits in several of Stravinsky's works. Contrary to a common misconception, Adorno didn't believe the hebephrenic and psychotic imitations that the music was supposed to contain were its main fault, as he pointed out in a postscript that he added later to his book. Adorno's criticism of Stravinsky is more concerned with the \"transition to positivity\" Adorno found in his neoclassical works.{{sfn|Adorno|2006|p=167}} Part of the composer's error, in Adorno's view, was his neoclassicism,{{sfn|Adorno|1973|pp=206\u201309}} but of greater importance was his music's \"pseudomorphism of painting\", playing off {{lang|fr|le temps espace}} (time-space) rather than {{lang|fr|le temps dur\u00e9e}} (time-duration) of [[Henri Bergson]].{{sfn|Adorno|1973|pp=191\u201393}} According to Adorno, \"one trick characterizes all of Stravinsky's formal endeavors: the effort of his music to portray time as in a circus tableau and to present time complexes as though they were spatial. This trick, however, soon exhausts itself.\"{{sfn|Adorno|1973|p=195}} Adorno maintained that the \"rhythmic procedures closely resemble the schema of catatonic conditions. In certain schizophrenics, the process by which the motor apparatus becomes independent leads to infinite repetition of gestures or words, following the decay of the ego.\"{{sfn|Adorno|1973|p=178}}\n\nStravinsky's reputation in Russia and the USSR rose and fell. Performances of his music were banned from around 1933 until 1962, the year [[Nikita Khrushchev]] invited him to the USSR for an official state visit. In 1972, an official proclamation by the Soviet Minister of Culture, [[Yekaterina Furtseva]], ordered Soviet musicians to \"study and admire\" Stravinsky's music and she made hostility toward it a potential offence.{{specify |reason=what type of offence? |date=November 2017}}{{sfn|Karlinsky|1985|p=282}}<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/tempo/article/books/9671C20C4B0030BEAAFA07BDCD28BE84|title=Books -|journal=Tempo|issue=118|pages=39\u201340|accessdate=25 November 2017|via=Cambridge Core|doi=10.1017/S004029820002845X|year=1976}}</ref>\n<!--During his lifetime, Stravinsky was often criticized for the apparently abrupt changes in style from one work to another.

He is widely considered one of the most important and influential [[20th-century classical music|composers of the 20th century]].\n\nStravinsky's compositional career was notable for its stylistic diversity. He first achieved international fame with three ballets commissioned by the [[impresario]] [[Serge Diaghilev]] and first performed in Paris by Diaghilev's [[Ballets Russes]]: ''[[The Firebird]]'' (1910), ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]'' (1911), and ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' (1913). The latter transformed the way in which subsequent composers thought about rhythmic structure and was largely responsible for Stravinsky's enduring reputation as a musical revolutionary who pushed the boundaries of musical design. His \"Russian phase\", which continued with works such as ''[[Renard (Stravinsky)|Renard]]'', ''[[L'Histoire du soldat]]'' and ''[[Les Noces]]'', was followed in the 1920s by a period in which he turned to [[Neoclassicism (music)|neoclassicism]]. The works from this period tended to make use of traditional musical forms ([[concerto grosso]], [[fugue]] and [[symphony]]) and drew from earlier styles, especially those of the 18th century. In the 1950s, Stravinsky adopted [[serialism|serial]] procedures.

In February of that year, both were performed in Saint Petersburg at a concert that marked a turning point in Stravinsky's career. In the audience was [[Serge Diaghilev]], a Russian impresario and owner of the [[Ballets Russes]] who was struck with Stravinsky's compositions. He wished to stage a mix of Russian opera and ballet for the 1910 season in Paris, among them a new ballet from fresh talent that was based on the Russian fairytale of the [[Firebird (Slavic folklore)|Firebird]].{{sfn|White|1979|p=15}} After [[Anatoly Liadov]] was given the task of composing the score, he informed Diaghilev that he needed about one year to complete it.{{sfn|White|1979|p=16}} Diaghilev then asked the 28-year-old Stravinsky, who had provided satisfactory orchestrations for him for the previous season at short notice and agreed to compose a full score.{{sfn|White|1979|p=15}} At 50 minutes in length, ''[[The Firebird]]'' was revised by Stravinsky for concert performance in 1911, 1919, and 1945.\n\n''The Firebird'' premiered at the [[Palais Garnier|Opera de Paris]] on 25 June 1910 to widespread critical acclaim and Stravinsky became an overnight sensation.{{sfn|Walsh|2000|pp=142\u201343}}{{sfn|Walsh|2000|p=140}}{{sfn|Whiting|2005|p=30}} As his wife was expecting their third child, the Stravinskys spent the summer in [[La Baule-Escoublac|La Baule]] in western France.

The result was ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]'', based the Russian folk tale featuring the [[Petrushka|titular character]], a puppet, who falls in love with another, a ballerina. Though it failed to capture the immediate reception that ''The Firebird'' had following its premiere at [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet]] in June 1911, the production continued Stravinsky's success.\n\nIt was Stravinsky's third ballet for Diaghilev, ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'', that caused a sensation among critics, fellow composers, and concertgoers. Based on an original idea, the production features a series of primitive rituals celebrating the advent of spring, after which a young girl is chosen as a sacrificial victim and dances herself to death. Stravinsky's score contained many novel features for its time, including experiments in tonality, metre, rhythm, stress and dissonance. The radical nature of the music and choreography caused a near-riot at its premiere at the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]] on 29 May 1913.\n\nShortly after the premiere, Stravinsky contracted [[typhoid]] from eating bad oysters and he was confined to a Paris nursing home.

The ''[[Concerto in D (Stravinsky)|Concerto in D]]'' premiered in 1947.{{sfn|Walsh|2006|p=185, 190}} In January 1946, Stravinsky conducted the premiere of his ''[[Symphony in Three Movements]]'' at [[Carnegie Hall]] in New York City. It marked his first piece that was premiered in the US.{{sfn|Walsh|2006|p=188}} In 1947, Stravinsky was inspired to write his English-language opera ''[[The Rake's Progress]]'' from visiting an exhibition of the [[A Rake's Progress|same-titled series of paintings]] by cartoonist [[William Hogarth]] in Chicago. Hogarth's drawings, which told the story of a London man who lost his money and became a drunk, was an idea Stravinsky found attractive as an opera. American poet [[W. H.

It was his final performance as conductor in his lifetime.{{sfn|Walsh|2006|p=529}} While backstage at the venue, Stravinsky informed to Craft that he believed to have suffered from a stroke.{{sfn|Walsh|2006|p=528}} In August 1967, Stravinsky was hospitalised in Hollywood for bleeding stomach ulcers and thrombosis which required a blood transfusion. In his diary, Craft wrote that he spoon fed the ailing composer and held his hand: \"He says the warmth diminishes the pain.\"{{sfn|White|1979|p=154}}\n\nBy 1968, Stravinsky had recovered enough to resume touring across the US with him in the audience while Craft took to the conductor's post for the majority of the concerts.{{sfn|White|1979|p=155}} In May 1968, Stravinsky completed the piano arrangement of two songs by Austrian composer [[Hugo Wolf]] for a small orchestra.{{sfn|White|1979|p=155}} In October Stravinsky, Vera, and Craft travelled to Zurich, Switzerland to sort business matters with Stravinsky's family.

His successful career as a pianist and conductor took him to many of the world's major cities, including Paris, Venice, Berlin, London, [[Amsterdam]] and New York and he was known for his polite, courteous and helpful manner. Stravinsky was reputed to have been a philanderer and was rumoured to have had affairs with high-profile partners, such as [[Coco Chanel]]. He never referred to it himself, but Chanel spoke about the alleged affair at length to her biographer [[Paul Morand]] in 1946; the conversation was published thirty years later.{{sfn|Morand|1976|pp=121\u201324}} The accuracy of Chanel's claims has been disputed by both Stravinsky's widow, Vera, and by Craft.{{sfn|Davis|2006|p=439}} Chanel's fashion house avers there is no evidence that any affair between Chanel and Stravinsky ever occurred.<ref>[http://www.expatica.com/ch/news/swiss-news/Fact_or_fiction-Chanel_Stravinsky-affair-curtains-Cannes--_52910.html Fact-or-fiction Chanel-Stravinsky affair curtains Cannes].

Baptized at birth, he later rebelled against the Church and abandoned it by the time he was fourteen or fifteen years old.{{sfn|Stravinsky and Craft|1969|p=198}} Throughout the rise of his career he was estranged from Christianity and it was not until he reached his early forties that he experienced a spiritual crisis. After befriending a Russian Orthodox priest, Father Nicholas, after his move to [[Nice]] in 1924, he reconnected with his faith. He rejoined the Russian Orthodox Church and afterwards remained a committed Christian.{{sfn|Stravinsky and Craft|1960|p=51}} Robert Craft noted that Stravinsky prayed daily, before and after composing, and also prayed when facing difficulty.{{sfn|Stravinsky and Craft|1966|pp=172\u201375}} Towards the end of his life, he was no longer able to attend church services. In his late seventies, Stravinsky said:<blockquote>I cannot now evaluate the events that, at the end of those thirty years, made me discover the necessity of religious belief. I was not reasoned into my disposition. Though I admire the structured thought of theology ([[St Anselm|Anselm]]'s proof in the ''[[Fides quaerens intellectum|Fides Quaerens Intellectum]]'', for instance) it is to religion no more than counterpoint exercises are to music. I do not believe in bridges of reason or, indeed, in any form of extrapolation in religious matters. ...

In 1923, [[Erik Satie]] wrote an article about Igor Stravinsky in ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''.{{sfn|Satie|1923}} Satie had met Stravinsky for the first time in 1910. In the published article, Satie argued that measuring the \"greatness\" of an artist by comparing him to other artists, as if speaking about some \"truth\", is illusory and that every piece of music should be judged on its own merits and not by comparing it to the standards of other composers. That was exactly what [[Jean Cocteau]] did when he commented deprecatingly on Stravinsky in his 1918 book, {{lang|fr|Le Coq et l'Arlequin}}.{{sfn|Volta|1989|loc=first pages of chapter on contemporaries}}{{Page needed|date=May 2010}}\n\nAccording to ''[[The Musical Times]]'' in 1923:\n<blockquote>All the signs indicate a strong reaction against the nightmare of noise and eccentricity that was one of the legacies of the war....

Bach]], conceding that, \"there is no denying the greatness of Stravinsky. It is just that he is not great enough.\"{{sfn|Blitzstein|1935|p=330}} Blitzstein's [[Marxism|Marxist]] position was that Stravinsky's wish to \"divorce music from other streams of life\", which is \"symptomatic of an escape from reality\", resulted in a \"loss of stamina\", naming specifically ''[[Apollo (ballet)|Apollo]]'', the [[Capriccio for Piano and Orchestra|Capriccio]], and ''[[Le baiser de la f\u00e9e|Le Baiser de la f\u00e9e]]''.{{sfn|Blitzstein|1935|pp=346\u201347}}\n\nThe composer [[Constant Lambert]] described pieces such as ''[[L'Histoire du soldat]]'' as containing \"essentially cold-blooded abstraction\".{{sfn|Lambert|1936|p=94}} Lambert continued, \"melodic fragments in {{lang|fr|Histoire du Soldat}} are completely meaningless themselves. They are merely successions of notes that can conveniently be divided into groups of three, five, and seven and set against other mathematical groups\" and he described the cadenza for solo drums as \"musical purity ... achieved by a species of musical castration\". He compared Stravinsky's choice of \"the drabbest and least significant phrases\" to [[Gertrude Stein]]'s 'Everyday they were gay there, they were regularly gay there everyday' (\"Helen Furr and Georgine Skeene\", 1922), \"whose effect would be equally appreciated by someone with no knowledge of English whatsoever\".{{sfn|Lambert|1936|pp=101\u201305}}\n\nIn his 1949 book ''Philosophy of Modern Music'', [[Theodor W. Adorno]] described Stravinsky as an acrobat and spoke of [[Disorganized schizophrenia|hebephrenic]] and psychotic traits in several of Stravinsky's works. Contrary to a common misconception, Adorno didn't believe the hebephrenic and psychotic imitations that the music was supposed to contain were its main fault, as he pointed out in a postscript that he added later to his book. Adorno's criticism of Stravinsky is more concerned with the \"transition to positivity\" Adorno found in his neoclassical works.{{sfn|Adorno|2006|p=167}} Part of the composer's error, in Adorno's view, was his neoclassicism,{{sfn|Adorno|1973|pp=206\u201309}} but of greater importance was his music's \"pseudomorphism of painting\", playing off {{lang|fr|le temps espace}} (time-space) rather than {{lang|fr|le temps dur\u00e9e}} (time-duration) of [[Henri Bergson]].{{sfn|Adorno|1973|pp=191\u201393}} According to Adorno, \"one trick characterizes all of Stravinsky's formal endeavors: the effort of his music to portray time as in a circus tableau and to present time complexes as though they were spatial. This trick, however, soon exhausts itself.\"{{sfn|Adorno|1973|p=195}} Adorno maintained that the \"rhythmic procedures closely resemble the schema of catatonic conditions. In certain schizophrenics, the process by which the motor apparatus becomes independent leads to infinite repetition of gestures or words, following the decay of the ego.\"{{sfn|Adorno|1973|p=178}}\n\nStravinsky's reputation in Russia and the USSR rose and fell. Performances of his music were banned from around 1933 until 1962, the year [[Nikita Khrushchev]] invited him to the USSR for an official state visit. In 1972, an official proclamation by the Soviet Minister of Culture, [[Yekaterina Furtseva]], ordered Soviet musicians to \"study and admire\" Stravinsky's music and she made hostility toward it a potential offence.{{specify |reason=what type of offence? |date=November 2017}}{{sfn|Karlinsky|1985|p=282}}<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/tempo/article/books/9671C20C4B0030BEAAFA07BDCD28BE84|title=Books -|journal=Tempo|issue=118|pages=39\u201340|accessdate=25 November 2017|via=Cambridge Core|doi=10.1017/S004029820002845X|year=1976}}</ref>\n<!--During his lifetime, Stravinsky was often criticized for the apparently abrupt changes in style from one work to another.
