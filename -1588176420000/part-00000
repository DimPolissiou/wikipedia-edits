According to the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, it has a population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people.{{PH census|current}}\n\n\"Hermosa\" means \"beautiful\" in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. It has a total land area of {{convert|{{PH wikidata|area}}|km2}}.{{PSGC detail|nscb}}\n\nHermosa is home to the [[Roosevelt Protected Landscape]]. It is accessible via the [[Bataan Provincial Expressway]], off Exit 10.\n\n==Etymology==\nAccording to legend, a group of Spaniards first came to this place, surprised and amazed they exclaimed, ''Que Hermosa! Que Hermosa!'', when they saw some pretty maidens with long, black hair washing clothes and bathing in the brook. The boys who accompanied their sisters repeated what they heard from the Spaniards and upon returning home they repeated again and again what the Spaniards exclaimed. When the next group of Spaniards visited the place, they asked for its name. The folks didn't understand Spanish but answered \"Hermosa, Hermosa\". And that was how Hermosa got its name.\n\nAnother version was that \"Llana Hermosa\", meaning beautiful plain of white flowers was the original name of this town. When the province was created, the town was formally named Hermosa, a name that fits the place not only due to the plain's white flowers but more so to the beautiful maidens and places that abound the town.\n\n==History==\nHistorically, the town was established in 1756 by Dominican priests. At that time, it was known as Llana Hermosa and composed of Mabuco and Mabuyan. It was then still part of [[Pampanga]], like the rest of Bataan. It became an independent missionary center in 1756 with Saint Peter de Verona as its patron saint.\n\nThe town of Hermosa was very peaceful and progressive before [[World War II]]. When the war broke out, their quiet routine was disturbed. During the [[Bataan Death March]], civilians of Hermosa risked the ire of the [[Japanese Imperial Army|Japanese]] by secretly passing food to Filipino and American soldiers.\n\n==Geography==\nHermosa is south of [[Dinalupihan, Bataan|Dinalupihan]] and borders the province of the [[Pampanga]] to the northeast, with [[Manila Bay]] to the east.\n\nAccording to the [[Philippine Statistics Authority]], the {{PH wikidata|settlement_text}} has a land area of {{convert|{{PH wikidata|area}}|km2}}{{PSGC detail|area}} constituting {{percentage|{{PH wikidata|area}}|{{PH wikidata|area|Q13739}}|2|pad=yes}} of the {{convert|{{PH wikidata|area|Q13739}}|km2|2|adj=mid|-}} total area of Bataan.\n\n===Climate===\n{{Weather box\n| location     = Hermosa, Bataan\n| width        = auto\n| metric first = Yes\n| single line  = Yes\n| Jan high C = 31\n| Jan low C  = 19\n| Feb high C = 32\n| Feb low C  = 19\n| Mar high C = 34\n| Mar low C  = 20\n| Apr high C = 35\n| Apr low C  = 23\n| May high C = 33\n| May low C  = 25\n| Jun high C = 31\n| Jun low C  = 25\n| Jul high C = 29\n| Jul low C  = 24\n| Aug high C = 29\n| Aug low C  = 25\n| Sep high C = 29\n| Sep low C  = 25\n| Oct high C = 29\n| Oct low C  = 24\n| Nov high C = 30\n| Nov low C  = 23\n| Dec high C = 31\n| Dec low C  = 20\n| Jan precipitation mm = 7\n| Feb precipitation mm = 8\n| Mar precipitation mm = 14\n| Apr precipitation mm = 26\n| May precipitation mm = 127\n| Jun precipitation mm = 210\n| Jul precipitation mm = 263\n| Aug precipitation mm = 272\n| Sep precipitation mm = 218\n| Oct precipitation mm = 114\n| Nov precipitation mm = 46\n| Dec precipitation mm = 21\n| Jan rain days        = 4.0\n| Feb rain days        = 4.0\n| Mar rain days        = 6.9\n| Apr rain days        = 11.2\n| May rain days        = 21.0\n| Jun rain days        = 24.5\n| Jul rain days        = 27.4\n| Aug rain days        = 26.9\n| Sep rain days        = 25.9\n| Oct rain days        = 21.9\n| Nov rain days        = 13.4\n| Dec rain days        = 6.3\n| source 1 = Meteoblue <ref name=\"met_norms\">\n{{cite web \n| url = https://www.meteoblue.com/en/weather/historyclimate/climatemodelled/hermosa_philippines_1711829\n| title =  Hermosa: Average Temperatures and Rainfall\n| publisher = Meteoblue\n| accessdate = 26 April 2020 }}</ref>\n| date = 26 April 2020  \n}}\n\n===Barangays===\nHermosa is politically subdivided into 23 [[barangay]]s.{{PSGC detail|nscb}}\n\n{{PH brgy table lite|top}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|030805001| A.

It has a total land area of {{convert|{{PH wikidata|area}}|km2}}.{{PSGC detail|nscb}}\n\nHermosa is home to the [[Roosevelt Protected Landscape]]. It is accessible via the [[Bataan Provincial Expressway]], off Exit 10.\n\n==Etymology==\nAccording to legend, a group of Spaniards first came to this place, surprised and amazed they exclaimed, ''Que Hermosa! Que Hermosa!'', when they saw some pretty maidens with long, black hair washing clothes and bathing in the brook. The boys who accompanied their sisters repeated what they heard from the Spaniards and upon returning home they repeated again and again what the Spaniards exclaimed. When the next group of Spaniards visited the place, they asked for its name. The folks didn't understand Spanish but answered \"Hermosa, Hermosa\". And that was how Hermosa got its name.\n\nAnother version was that \"Llana Hermosa\", meaning beautiful plain of white flowers was the original name of this town. When the province was created, the town was formally named Hermosa, a name that fits the place not only due to the plain's white flowers but more so to the beautiful maidens and places that abound the town.\n\n==History==\nHistorically, the town was established in 1756 by Dominican priests. At that time, it was known as Llana Hermosa and composed of Mabuco and Mabuyan. It was then still part of [[Pampanga]], like the rest of Bataan. It became an independent missionary center in 1756 with Saint Peter de Verona as its patron saint.\n\nThe town of Hermosa was very peaceful and progressive before [[World War II]]. When the war broke out, their quiet routine was disturbed. During the [[Bataan Death March]], civilians of Hermosa risked the ire of the [[Japanese Imperial Army|Japanese]] by secretly passing food to Filipino and American soldiers.\n\n==Geography==\nHermosa is south of [[Dinalupihan, Bataan|Dinalupihan]] and borders the province of the [[Pampanga]] to the northeast, with [[Manila Bay]] to the east.\n\nAccording to the [[Philippine Statistics Authority]], the {{PH wikidata|settlement_text}} has a land area of {{convert|{{PH wikidata|area}}|km2}}{{PSGC detail|area}} constituting {{percentage|{{PH wikidata|area}}|{{PH wikidata|area|Q13739}}|2|pad=yes}} of the {{convert|{{PH wikidata|area|Q13739}}|km2|2|adj=mid|-}} total area of Bataan.\n\n==Climate==\n{{Weather box\n| location     = Hermosa, Bataan\n| width        = auto\n| metric first = Yes\n| single line  = Yes\n| Jan high C = 31\n| Jan low C  = 19\n| Feb high C = 32\n| Feb low C  = 19\n| Mar high C = 34\n| Mar low C  = 20\n| Apr high C = 35\n| Apr low C  = 23\n| May high C = 33\n| May low C  = 25\n| Jun high C = 31\n| Jun low C  = 25\n| Jul high C = 29\n| Jul low C  = 24\n| Aug high C = 29\n| Aug low C  = 25\n| Sep high C = 29\n| Sep low C  = 25\n| Oct high C = 29\n| Oct low C  = 24\n| Nov high C = 30\n| Nov low C  = 23\n| Dec high C = 31\n| Dec low C  = 20\n| Jan precipitation mm = 7\n| Feb precipitation mm = 8\n| Mar precipitation mm = 14\n| Apr precipitation mm = 26\n| May precipitation mm = 127\n| Jun precipitation mm = 210\n| Jul precipitation mm = 263\n| Aug precipitation mm = 272\n| Sep precipitation mm = 218\n| Oct precipitation mm = 114\n| Nov precipitation mm = 46\n| Dec precipitation mm = 21\n| Jan rain days        = 4.0\n| Feb rain days        = 4.0\n| Mar rain days        = 6.9\n| Apr rain days        = 11.2\n| May rain days        = 21.0\n| Jun rain days        = 24.5\n| Jul rain days        = 27.4\n| Aug rain days        = 26.9\n| Sep rain days        = 25.9\n| Oct rain days        = 21.9\n| Nov rain days        = 13.4\n| Dec rain days        = 6.3\n| source 1 = Meteoblue <ref name=\"met_norms\">\n{{cite web \n| url = https://www.meteoblue.com/en/weather/historyclimate/climatemodelled/hermosa_philippines_1711829\n| title =  Hermosa: Average Temperatures and Rainfall\n| publisher = Meteoblue\n| accessdate = 26 April 2020 }}</ref>\n| date = 26 April 2020  \n}}\n\n==Barangays==\nHermosa is politically subdivided into 23 [[barangay]]s.{{PSGC detail|nscb}}\n\n{{PH brgy table lite|top}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|030805001| A.

He was known as an author of books that draw upon African mythology, traditional [[Bantu mythology|Zulu folklore]], [[Reptilian humanoid|extraterrestrial]] encounters and his own personal encounters.

His father was a builder and a [[Christians|Christian]] and his mother was a young Zulu girl. Caught between [[Catholic]] missionaries on one hand, and a stubborn old Zulu warrior, Credo Mutwa's maternal grandfather, his parents had no choice but to separate. Credo was born out of wedlock, which caused a great scandal in the village and his mother was thrown out by her father. Later he was taken in by one of his aunts.<ref>[http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_credo_mutwa04.htm Credo Mutwa biography.]</ref>\n\nHe was subsequently raised by his father's brother and was taken to the South Coast of [[Natal Province|Natal]] (present day [[KwaZulu-Natal]]), near the northern bank of the [[Mkomazi River]]. He did not attend school until he was 14 years old. In 1935 his father found a building job in the old [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]] province and the whole family relocated to where he was building.\n\nAfter falling severely ill, he was taken back to KwaZulu-Natal by his uncle. Where modern medicine had failed, his grandfather, a man whom his father despised as a heathen and demon worshipper, helped him back to health. At this point, Credo began to question many of the things about his people the [[Missionary|missionaries]] would have them believe. \"Were we Africans really a race of primitives who possessed no knowledge at all before the white man came to Africa?\" he asked himself. His grandfather instilled in him the belief that his illness was a sacred calling that he was to become a [[sangoma]], a healer. He underwent ''thwasa'' (sangoma training and initiation) with his grandfather and mother's sister, a young [[sangoma]] named Mynah.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mutwa|first=Credo|year=1996|title=Zulu Shaman|publisher=Destiny Books|isbn=0-89281-129-3}}</ref>\n\n==Kwa-Khaya Lendaba cultural village==\n\n[[File:Credo_Mutwa_Cultural_Village_Soweto.jpg|thumb|right|An entrance marked by sculptural portrait of King [[Gungunhana|Ngungunyane]] on the left and King [[Shaka]] on the right.[[Traditional healers of South Africa#Thwasa and initiation|Initiation]] area of the Kwa-Khaya Lendaba Cultural village in [[Soweto]]]]In 1974, Credo obtained a piece of land on the [[Harry Frederick Oppenheimer|Oppenheimer]] gardens in [[Soweto]] in order to create an African cultural village to preserve cultural heritage and his own teachings.<ref>{{cite web|title=Credo Mutwa Cultural Village and Oppenheimer Tower|url=http://www.heritagecollection.co.za/detail/items/credo-mutwa-cultural-village-and-Oppenheimer-Tower.html|publisher=Moja Heritage Collection|accessdate=5 September 2014}}</ref> He created traditional dwellings imaginatively representing  building patterns from across Africa, while human and mythological figures brought to life African folk-lore, beliefs and traditions as seen through his artistic vision.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.joburg.org.za:443/media_/MediaStatements/Pages/2018%20Press%20Releases/City-saddened-by-the-burning-of-the-Xhosa-hut-at-the-Credo-Mutwa-Village.aspx|title=City saddened by the burning of the Xhosa hut at the Credo Mutwa Village|website=www.joburg.org.za|language=en-ZA|access-date=2019-06-19}}</ref> At the time, as the locals were steeped in Christianity, they were suspicious of the cultural village.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://m.news24.com/Archives/City-Press/The-rich-heritage-of-Credo-Mutwa-20150429|title=The rich heritage of Credo Mutwa|date=2012-07-20|website=News24|access-date=2019-06-19}}</ref>\n\nCredo believed that the [[Soweto uprising|great unrest]] in Johannesburg and the popularisation of [[South African Communist Party|communism]] in the black struggle drew Africans away from their traditional roots.

He was known as an author of books that draw upon African mythology, traditional [[Bantu mythology|Zulu folklore]], [[Reptilian humanoid|extraterrestrial]] encounters and his own personal encounters. His last work was a graphic novel called the ''Tree of Life Trilogy'' based on his writings of his most famous book, ''Indaba my Children''.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Tree of life Trilogy|url=http://vusamazulu.com/|accessdate=5 September 2014}}</ref> In 2018 he was honoured with an USIBA award presented by the South African Department of Arts and Culture, for his work in Indigenous Wisdom.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iol.co.za/the-star/news/creatives-honoured-at-inaugural-usiba-awards-15327267|title=Creatives honoured at inaugural USIBA awards {{!}} The Star|website=www.iol.co.za|language=en|access-date=2019-06-19}}</ref>\n\nCredo called himself a ''sanusi'' (common spelling ''isanuse'') which is a type of Zulu diviner or sangoma.

His father was a builder and a [[Christians|Christian]] and his mother was a young Zulu girl. Caught between [[Catholic]] missionaries on one hand, and a stubborn old Zulu warrior, Credo Mutwa's maternal grandfather, his parents had no choice but to separate. Credo was born out of wedlock, which caused a great scandal in the village and his mother was thrown out by her father. Later he was taken in by one of his aunts.<ref>[http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_credo_mutwa04.htm Credo Mutwa biography.]</ref>\n\nHe was subsequently raised by his father's brother and was taken to the South Coast of [[Natal Province|Natal]] (present day [[KwaZulu-Natal]]), near the northern bank of the [[Mkomazi River]]. He did not attend school until he was 14 years old. In 1935 his father found a building job in the old [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]] province and the whole family relocated to where he was building.\n\nAfter falling severely ill, he was taken back to KwaZulu-Natal by his uncle. Where modern medicine had failed, his grandfather, a man whom his father despised as a heathen and demon worshipper, helped him back to health. At this point, Credo began to question many of the things about his people the [[Missionary|missionaries]] would have them believe. \"Were we Africans really a race of primitives who possessed no knowledge at all before the white man came to Africa?\" he asked himself. His grandfather instilled in him the belief that his illness was a sacred calling that he was to become a [[sangoma]], a healer. He underwent ''thwasa'' (sangoma training and initiation) with his grandfather and mother's sister, a young [[sangoma]] named Mynah.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mutwa|first=Credo|year=1996|title=Zulu Shaman|publisher=Destiny Books|isbn=0-89281-129-3}}</ref>\n\n==Kwa-Khaya Lendaba cultural village==\n\n[[File:Credo_Mutwa_Cultural_Village_Soweto.jpg|thumb|right|An entrance marked by sculptural portrait of King [[Gungunhana|Ngungunyane]] on the left and King [[Shaka]] on the right.[[Traditional healers of South Africa#Thwasa and initiation|Initiation]] area of the Kwa-Khaya Lendaba Cultural village in [[Soweto]]]]In 1974, Credo obtained a piece of land on the [[Harry Frederick Oppenheimer|Oppenheimer]] gardens in [[Soweto]] in order to create an African cultural village to preserve cultural heritage and his own teachings.<ref>{{cite web|title=Credo Mutwa Cultural Village and Oppenheimer Tower|url=http://www.heritagecollection.co.za/detail/items/credo-mutwa-cultural-village-and-Oppenheimer-Tower.html|publisher=Moja Heritage Collection|accessdate=5 September 2014}}</ref> He created traditional dwellings imaginatively representing  building patterns from across Africa, while human and mythological figures brought to life African folk-lore, beliefs and traditions as seen through his artistic vision.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.joburg.org.za:443/media_/MediaStatements/Pages/2018%20Press%20Releases/City-saddened-by-the-burning-of-the-Xhosa-hut-at-the-Credo-Mutwa-Village.aspx|title=City saddened by the burning of the Xhosa hut at the Credo Mutwa Village|website=www.joburg.org.za|language=en-ZA|access-date=2019-06-19}}</ref> At the time, as the locals were steeped in Christianity, they were suspicious of the cultural village.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://m.news24.com/Archives/City-Press/The-rich-heritage-of-Credo-Mutwa-20150429|title=The rich heritage of Credo Mutwa|date=2012-07-20|website=News24|access-date=2019-06-19}}</ref>\n\nCredo believed that the [[Soweto uprising|great unrest]] in Johannesburg and the popularisation of [[South African Communist Party|communism]] in the black struggle drew Africans away from their traditional roots.

He couldn't satisfy them all sexually, and so they went out and satisfied themselves elsewhere, which led to them all contracting incurable [[sexually transmitted infections]]. The sores on King Khandakhulu's penis resemble the [[Red ribbon|AIDS ribbon]]. These sculptures were created in 1979, three years before scientists uncovered the human immunodeficiency virus.<ref Name=\"CP\"/> Claims of his other predictions include the destruction of World Trade Centres in the [[September 11 attacks]], [[Chris Hani]]'s assassination, and the ousting of president [[Thabo Mbeki]], among others.<ref Name=\"CP\"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Mbeki's Darkest Hour: sangoma predicted his ouster in 1999|url=http://www.newzimbabwe.com/pages/zuma27.18898.html|date=13 November 2009|publisher=New Zimbabwe.com|accessdate=6 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Views on HIV/AIDS==\nMutwa was an active and vocal advocate in the use of [[traditional African medicine]]s for the treatment of [[HIV/AIDS]], [[cancer]] and [[tuberculosis]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Medicinal plant fights Aids|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1683259.stm|date=30 November 2001|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=3 September 2014}}</ref> He created a trust called the Vulinda Trust in 1999 to preserve traditional knowledge and to promote the use of these traditional medicines.

This process adds an element of sculpture to origami, which is otherwise purely geometric. Wet-folding is used very often by professional folders for non-geometric origami, such as animals.

Wet-folding allows for increased rigidity and structure due to a process called ''[[sizing]]''. Sizing is a water-soluble adhesive, usually [[methylcellulose]] or [[methyl acetate]], that may be added during the manufacture of t he paper. As the paper dries, the chemical bonds of the fibers of the paper tighten together which results in a crisper and stronger arms sheet. In order to moisten the paper, an artist typically wipes the sheet with a dampened cloth. The amount of moisture added to the paper is crucial, because too little will cause the arse to dry quickly and spring back into its original position before the folding is complete, while too much will either fray the edges of the paper or will cause the paper to split at high-stress points.\n\n== Notes and references ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9]]\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Wet-folding origami}}\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTB_n-hR6VY Mini-documentary about Joisel] at [[YouTube]]\n* [http://www.giladorigami.com/Articles_Wetfolding.html An illustrated introduction to wet-folding]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wet-Folding}}\n[[Category:Origami]]\n\n\n{{sculpture-stub}}\n", "text_old": "[[Image:Wet-folding bull.jpg|thumb|<center>Wet-folded bull</center>]]\n'''Wet-folding''' is an [[origami]] technique developed by [[Akira Yoshizawa]] that employs water to dampen the [[paper]] so that it can be manipulated more easily.

The amount of moisture added to the paper is crucial, because too little will cause the paper to dry quickly and spring back into its original position before the folding is complete, while too much will either fray the edges of the paper or will cause the paper to split at high-stress points.\n\n== Notes and references ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9]]\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Wet-folding origami}}\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTB_n-hR6VY Mini-documentary about Joisel] at [[YouTube]]\n* [http://www.giladorigami.com/Articles_Wetfolding.html An illustrated introduction to wet-folding]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wet-Folding}}\n[[Category:Origami]]\n\n\n{{sculpture-stub}}\n", "name_user": "122.150.66.241", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet-folding"}

Some concepts of [[Gehenna]] in [[Judaism]] are similar to that of purgatory. The word \"purgatory\" has come to refer also to a wide range of historical and modern conceptions of postmortem suffering short of everlasting damnation<ref name=EB/> and is used, in a non-specific sense, to mean any place or condition of [[suffering]] or torment, especially one that is temporary.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reverso.net/english-definitions/purgatory |title=purgatory definition - English definition dictionary - Reverso |publisher=dictionary.reverso.net}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Catholic Church]] holds that \"all who die in God's grace and friendship but still imperfectly purified\" undergo the process of purification which the Church calls purgatory, \"so as to achieve the holiness necessary to enter the joy of [[Heaven in Christianity|heaven]]\". It has formulated this doctrine by reference to biblical verses that speak of purifying fire ([[1 Corinthians 3]]:1, {{bibleverse|1 Corinthians|3:15}} and {{bibleverse|1 Peter|1:7}}) and to the mention by Jesus of forgiveness in the age to come ({{bibleverse|Matthew|12:32}}). It bases its teaching also on the practice of praying for the dead in use within the Church ever since the Church began, mentioned  just once in the [[Bible]], in [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Maccabees+12%3A43-46&version=DRA 2 Macc 12:46].<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P2N.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, \"The Final Purification, or Purgatory\"]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/COUNCILS/TRENT25.HTM#1|title=Pius IV Council of Trent-25 |publisher=www.ewtn.com}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Jacques Le Goff]], the conception of purgatory as a physical place came into existence in [[Western Europe]] towards the end of the twelfth century.<ref>LeGoff, Jacques.

Some have explicitly rejected the notions of punishment by fire in a particular place that are prominent in the popular picture of purgatory. The representatives of the [[Orthodox Church]] at the [[Council of Florence]] argued against these notions, while declaring that they do hold that there is a cleansing after death of the souls of the saved and that these are assisted by the prayers of the living: \"If souls depart from this life in faith and charity but marked with some defilements, whether unrepented minor ones or major ones repented of but without having yet borne the fruits of repentance, we believe that within reason they are purified of those faults, but not by some purifying fire and particular punishments in some place.\"<ref>[https://archive.org/details/patrologiaorient15pariuoft/page/40 \"First Speech by Mark, Archbishop of Ephesus, on Purifying Fire\" in ''Patrologia Orientalis'', vol. 15, pp. 40\u201341]</ref> The definition of purgatory adopted by that council excluded the two notions with which the Orthodox disagreed and mentioned only the two points that, they said, were part of their faith also. Accordingly, the agreement, known as the [[Union of Brest]], that formalized the admission of the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]] into the full [[communion (Christian)|communion]] of the Roman Catholic Church stated: \"We shall not debate about purgatory, but we entrust ourselves to the teaching of the Holy Church\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1595brest.html|title=Treaty of Brest, Article 5|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n====Fire====\nFire has an important place in the popular image of purgatory and has been the object of speculation by theologians, speculation to which the article on purgatory in the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' relates the warning by the Council of Trent against \"difficult and subtle questions which tend not to edification.\"<ref name=\"Catholic Encyclopedia on Purgatory\">{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12575a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Purgatory|website=www.newadvent.org}}</ref>\n\nFire has never been included in the Catholic Church's defined doctrine on purgatory, but speculation about it is traditional. \"The tradition of the Church, by reference to certain texts of Scripture, speaks of a cleansing fire.\"<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P2N.HTM#$1BW Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1031]</ref> In this regard the ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' references in particular two New Testament passages: \"If anyone's work is burned up, he will suffer loss, though he himself will be saved, but only as through fire\"<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Corinthians|3:15|ESV}}</ref> and \"so that the tested genuineness of your faith\u2014more precious than gold that perishes though it is tested by fire\u2014may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ\".<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Peter|1:7|ESV}}</ref> Catholic theologians have also cited verses such as \"I will put this third into the fire, and refine them as one refines silver, and test them as gold is tested.

Catherine asserts that God is so pure and holy that a soul stained by sin cannot be in the presence of the divine majesty. We too feel how distant we are, how full we are of so many things that we cannot see God. The soul is aware of the immense love and perfect justice of God and consequently suffers for having failed to respond in a correct and perfect way to this love; and love for God itself becomes a flame, love itself cleanses it from the residue of sin.\"<ref>[http://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/audiences/2011/documents/hf_ben-xvi_aud_20110112.html Pope Benedict XVI, General Audience of 12 January 2011]</ref>\n\nIn his 2007 encyclical ''Spe salvi'', Pope Benedict XVI, referring to the words of [[Paul the Apostle]] in {{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|3:12\u201315|ESV}} about a fire that both burns and saves, spoke of the opinion that \"the fire which both burns and saves is Christ himself, the Judge and Saviour. The encounter with him is the decisive act of judgement. Before his gaze all falsehood melts away. This encounter with him, as it burns us, transforms and frees us, allowing us to become truly ourselves. All that we build during our lives can prove to be mere straw, pure bluster, and it collapses. Yet in the pain of this encounter, when the impurity and sickness of our lives become evident to us, there lies salvation. His gaze, the touch of his heart heals us through an undeniably painful transformation 'as through fire'. But it is a blessed pain, in which the holy power of his love sears through us like a flame, enabling us to become totally ourselves and thus totally of God. In this way the inter-relation between justice and grace also becomes clear: the way we live our lives is not immaterial, but our defilement does not stain us for ever if we have at least continued to reach out towards Christ, towards truth and towards love. Indeed, it has already been burned away through Christ's Passion. At the moment of judgement we experience and we absorb the overwhelming power of his love over all the evil in the world and in ourselves. The pain of love becomes our salvation and our joy. It is clear that we cannot calculate the 'duration' of this transforming burning in terms of the chronological measurements of this world. The transforming 'moment' of this encounter eludes earthly time-reckoning \u2014 it is the heart's time, it is the time of 'passage' to communion with God in the Body of Christ.\"<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/encyclicals/documents/hf_ben-xvi_enc_20071130_spe-salvi_en.html Encyclical ''Spe salvi''], 46\u201347].</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Peter Paul Rubens 172.jpg | Purgatory, by [[Peter Paul Rubens]]\nFile:Concepcion Santa Cruz 09.jpg | Altar in [[Iglesia de la Concepci\u00f3n (Santa Cruz de Tenerife)|Iglesia de la Concepci\u00f3n]], [[Santa Cruz de Tenerife]]\nFile:Folio 113v - Purgatory.jpg | A fiery purgatory in the ''[[Tr\u00e8s riches heures du Duc de Berry]]''\nFile:V.Carmen de Beniajan-general.jpg | [[Our Lady of Mount Carmel]] and purgatory, [[Beniaj\u00e1n]], [[Spain]]\nFile:LadyOfMtCarmelWithSufferingSouls.jpg | [[Our Lady of Mount Carmel]] and purgatory, [[North End, Boston]]\nFile:Auhausen St. Maria 473gf.JPG | Detail of altar in Lutheran church in [[Auhausen]], [[Bavaria]]\nFile:AMR Kirche - Altar 3.jpg | Our Lady, St Monica and souls in purgatory, [[Rattenberg]], [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]]\nFile:Kientzheim StFelix 30.JPG | Our Lady of Passau in St Felix Church, [[Kientzheim]], [[Alsace]]\nFile:Heidelberg cpg 144 Els\u00e4ssische Legenda Aurea 338r St. Patricks Fegefeuer.jpg | Purgatory, 1419 drawing by unknown artist from [[Strasbourg]]\nFile:Michel-Serre-Vierge \u00e0 l'enfant et le purgatoire.jpg | Painting by [[Michel Serre]] in the Saint Cannat Church, [[Marseilles]]\nFile:Wimpfen-stadtkirche-predell.jpg |Altar predella in the town church of [[Bad Wimpfen]], [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]]\nFile:Mantlach - Velburg NM 002.JPG | Request for prayer for the souls in purgatory\nFile:Catedral de San Juan Bautista de Puerto Rico - DSC06866.JPG | Stained-glass window in [[Puerto Rico]] Cathedral\nFile:Cristobal Rojas 46a.JPG | Purgatory by Venezuelan painter [[Crist\u00f3bal Rojas (artist)|Crist\u00f3bal Rojas]] (1890)\nFile:St.Ulrich am Pillersee - Deckenfresko 1a.jpg | Ceiling of St Ulrich Church in [[Pillersee]], [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]], Austria\nFile:Andrea Vaccaro - The Virgin intercedes for the Souls in Purgatory.jpg |Our Lady Interceding for the Souls in Purgatory, by [[Andrea Vaccaro]]\nFile:Stephan Lochner Souls in Purgatory.jpg | Miniature by [[Stefan Lochner]] showing souls in purgatory\nFile:\u00c1nimas Benditas.jpg | [[Azulejo]] of souls in purgatory, [[Seville]], [[Spain]]\n</gallery>\n\n==== Popular notion of purgatory as a place ====\n[[File:William Frederick Wakeman Lough Derg.png|thumb|The island of St Patrick's Purgatory]]\nIn his ''La naissance du Purgatoire'' (''The Birth of Purgatory''), [[Jacques Le Goff]] attributes the origin of the idea of a third other-world domain, similar to heaven and hell, called Purgatory, to Paris intellectuals and [[Cistercians|Cistercian monks]] at some point in the last three decades of the twelfth century, possibly as early as 1170\u22121180.

Above the mountain St Patrick introduces the prayers of the faithful that can help attenuate the sufferings of the souls undergoing purification. In each opening, sinners are tormented by demons and by fire. Each of the seven deadly sins \u2013 avarice, envy, sloth, pride, anger, lust, and gluttony \u2013 has its own region of purgatory and its own appropriate tortures. \n\n[[File:Dante03.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Dante gazes at purgatory (shown as a mountain) in this 16th-century painting.]]\nLe Goff dedicates the final chapter of his book to the ''Purgatorio'', the second book in [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s fourteenth-century ''[[The Divine Comedy|La divina commedia]]'' (''The Divine Comedy''). In an interview Le Goff declared: \"Dante's ''Purgatorio'' represents the sublime conclusion of the slow development of Purgatory that took place in the course of the Middle Ages. The power of Dante's poetry made a decisive contribution to fixing in the public imagination this 'third place', whose birth was on the whole quite recent.\"<ref>[https://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2005/09/27/invenzione-del-purgatorio.html Fabio Gambaro, \"L'invenzione del purgatorio\" in ''La Repubblica'', 27 September 2005]</ref>\n\nDante pictures purgatory as an island at the [[antipodes]] of Jerusalem, pushed up, in an otherwise empty sea, by the displacement caused by the fall of Satan, which left him fixed at the central point of the globe of the Earth. The cone-shaped island has seven terraces on which souls are cleansed from the [[seven deadly sins]] or capital vices as they ascend. Additional spurs at the base hold those for whom beginning the ascent is delayed because in life they were excommunicates, indolent or late repenters. At the summit is the [[Garden of Eden|earthly paradise]], from where the souls, cleansed of evil tendencies and made perfect, are taken to heaven.\n\nThe Catholic Church has not included in its teaching this idea of purgatory as a place, any more than it has sealed with its authority the idea of a [[Limbo]], which also has been postulated by some theologians.\n\nOn 4 August 1999, [[Pope John Paul II]], speaking of purgatory, said: \"The term does not indicate a place, but a condition of existence.

Its place is decided forever by its Creator and judge. The Orthodox Church does not believe in purgatory (a place of purging), that is, the inter-mediate state after death in which the souls of the saved (those who have not received temporal punishment for their sins) are purified of all taint preparatory to entering into Heaven, where every soul is perfect and fit to see God. Also, the Orthodox Church does not believe in indulgences as remissions from purgatorial punishment. Both purgatory and indulgences are inter-corelated theories, unwitnessed in the Bible or in the Ancient Church, and when they were enforced and applied they brought about evil practices at the expense of the prevailing Truths of the Church. If Almighty God in His merciful loving-kindness changes the dreadful situation of the sinner, it is unknown to the Church of Christ. The Church lived for fifteen hundred years without such a theory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goarch.org/ourfaith/ourfaith7076|title=Death, the Threshold to Eternal Life - Liturgy & Worship - Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America|website=www.goarch.org}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nEastern Orthodox teaching is that, while all undergo an [[particular judgment|individual judgment]] immediately after death, neither the just nor the wicked attain the final state of bliss or punishment before the Last Day,<ref>John Meyondorff, ''Byzantine Theology'' (London: Mowbrays, 1974) pp. 220\u2013221. \"At death man's body goes to the earth from which it was taken, and the soul, being immortal, goes to God, who gave it.

He lists some \"biblical hints of purgatory\" (Mal 3:2; 2 Mac 12:41-43; Mat 12:32; 1 Cor 3:12) that helped give rise to the doctrine,<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=kFqzG3UPz3EC&pg=PA11&lpg=PA11&dq=Walls+%22biblical+hints%22+purgatory&source=bl&ots=hYH-KGdHDg&sig=ACfU3U2Me8KNiiI3IahGk31kghLn1dEnKQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjSr_qq_qniAhUYThUIHZkSBo0Q6AEwEnoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=Walls%20%22biblical%20hints%22%20purgatory&f=false Jerry L.

Rather his basic argument is that, in a phrase he often uses, it \"makes sense.\"<ref>For example, Walls,  2012, p. 71</ref> For Walls, purgatory has a [[logic]], as in the title of his book. He documents the \"contrast between the satisfaction and sanctification models\" of purgatory. In the satisfaction model, \"the punishment of purgatory\" is to satisfy God's justice. In the sanctification model, Wall writes: \"Purgatory might be pictured ... as a regimen to regain one\u2019s spiritual health and get back into moral shape.\"<ref>Walls, 2012, pp. 76, 90.</ref> In Catholic theology Walls finds that the doctrine of purgatory has \"swung\" between the \"poles of satisfaction and sanctification\" sometimes \"combining both elements somewhere in the middle\". He believes the sanctification model \"can be affirmed by Protestants without in any way contradicting their theology\" and that they may find that it \"makes better sense of how the remains of sin are purged\" than an instantaneous cleansing at the moment of death.<ref>Walls 2012, p. 90</ref>\n\nWhile purgatory was disputed by the Reformers, some early patristic theologians of the Eastern Church taught and believed in \"[[apocatastasis]]\", the belief that all creation would be restored to its original perfect condition after a remedial purgatorial reformation. [[Clement of Alexandria]] was one of the early church theologians who taught this view. Protestants have always contended that there are no second chances. However, for Lutherans a similar doctrine of what may happen to the unevangelized is expressed in the book titled ''What about those who never heard''.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=FE9YWMQo_94C&dq=What+about+those+who+never+heard&source=gbs_navlinks_s Gabriel Fackre, Ronald H.

This place, called \"the spirit world,\" includes \"paradise\" for the righteous and \"prison\" for those who do not know God. Spirits in paradise serve as missionaries to the spirits in prison, who can still accept salvation. In this sense, spirit prison can be conceptualized as a type of purgatory. In addition to hearing the message from the missionary spirits, the spirits in prison can also accept posthumous baptism and other posthumous ordinances performed by living church members in temples on Earth. This is frequently referred to as \"baptism for the dead\" and \"temple work.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christiandataresources.com/mormonbeliefs2.htm|title=What Do Mormons Believe (The God Makers)?|website=www.christiandataresources.com}}</ref> Members of the Church believe that during the three days following Christ's crucifixion, he preached his gospel to inhabitants of spirit prison.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://eom.byu.edu/index.php/Spirit_Prison|title=Spirit Prison - The Encyclopedia of Mormonism|website=eom.byu.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-05-17}}</ref>\n\n==Judaism==\nIn [[Judaism]], [[Gehenna]] is a place of purification where, according to some traditions, most sinners spend up to a year before release.\n\nThe view of purgatory can be found in the teaching of the Shammaites: \"In the last judgment day there shall be three classes of souls: the righteous shall at once be written down for the life everlasting; the wicked, for Gehenna; but those whose virtues and sins counterbalance one another shall go down to Gehenna and float up and down until they rise purified; for of them it is said: 'I will bring the third part into the fire and refine them as silver is refined, and try them as gold is tried' [Zech. xiii. 9.]; also, 'He [the Lord] bringeth down to Sheol and bringeth up again'\" (I Sam. ii. 6). The Hillelites seem to have had no purgatory; for they said: \"He who is 'plenteous in mercy' [Ex. xxxiv. 6.] inclines the balance toward mercy, and consequently the intermediates do not descend into Gehenna\" (Tosef., Sanh. xiii. 3; R. H. 16b; Bacher, \"Ag. Tan.\" i. 18). Still they also speak of an intermediate state.\n\nRegarding the time which purgatory lasts, the accepted opinion of R. Akiba is twelve months; according to R. Johanan b. Nuri, it is only forty-nine days. Both opinions are based upon Isa. lxvi. 23\u201324: \"From one new moon to another and from one Sabbath to another shall all flesh come to worship before Me, and they shall go forth and look upon the carcasses of the men that have transgressed against Me; for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched\"; the former interpreting the words \"from one new moon to another\" to signify all the months of a year; the latter interpreting the words \"from one Sabbath to another,\" in accordance with Lev. xxiii. 15\u201316, to signify seven weeks. During the twelve months, declares the baraita (Tosef., Sanh. xiii. 4\u20135; R.

To Le Goff's analysis of the Medieval origins of the doctrine, Thiel adds that : \"The birth of purgatory negotiated the eschatological anxiety of the laity. ...In a manner similar to the ascetic\u2019s lifelong lengthening of the temporal field of competition with the martyr, belief in purgatory lengthened the layperson\u2019s temporal field of competition with the ascetic.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Thiel|first=John E.|date=2008|title=Time, Judgment, and Competitive Spirituality: A Reading of the Development of the Doctrine of Purgatory|url=http://cdn.theologicalstudies.net/69/69.4/69.4.1.pdf|journal=Theological Studies|volume=69|pages=741-785|via=}}</ref>\n\n==== Role in relation to sin ====\n\nAccording to the doctrine of the [[Catholic Church]], those who die in God's grace and friendship imperfectly purified, although they are assured of their eternal salvation, undergo a purification after death, so as to achieve the holiness necessary to enter the [[beatific vision|joy of God]].<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P2R.HTM CCC 1054]</ref>\n\nUnless \"redeemed by repentance and God's forgiveness\", [[mortal sin]], whose object is grave matter and is also committed with full knowledge and deliberate consent, \"causes exclusion from Christ's kingdom and the eternal death of hell, for our freedom has the power to make choices for ever, with no turning back.\"<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P6C.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1855\u22121861]</ref> Such sin \"makes us incapable of eternal life, the privation of which is called the 'eternal punishment' of sin\".<ref name=CCC1472>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P4G.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1472]</ref>\n\n[[Venial sin]], while not depriving the sinner of friendship with God or the eternal happiness of heaven,<ref name=\"CCC 1863\">{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P6C.HTM|title=CCC 1863}}</ref> \"weakens charity, manifests a disordered affection for created goods, and impedes the soul's progress in the exercise of the virtues and the practice of the moral good; it merits temporal punishment\",<ref name=\"CCC 1863\"/> for \"every sin, even venial, entails an unhealthy attachment to creatures, which must be purified either here on earth, or after death in the state called Purgatory.

[[Paul J. Griffiths]] notes: \"Recent Catholic thought on purgatory typically preserves the essentials of the basic doctrine while also offering second-hand speculative interpretations of these elements\".<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N1XYXMTe1jYC&pg=PA436&dq=Griffiths+purgatory+second-order&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi42pv2wNHfAhWyQxUIHZV2A14Q6AEILjAB#v=onepage&q=Griffiths%20purgatory%20second-order&f=false |author=Paul J.

Walls |title=The Oxford Handbook of Eschatology |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2010 |p=436}}</ref> Thus [[Joseph Ratzinger]] wrote: \"Purgatory is not, as [[Tertullian]] thought, some kind of supra-worldly concentration camp where man is forced to undergo punishment in a more or less arbitrary fashion. Rather it is the inwardly necessary process of transformation in which a person becomes capable of Christ, capable of God, and thus capable of unity with the whole communion of saints\".<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=AfomsX5KtYkC&pg=PA230&dq=supra-worldly+concentration#v=onepage&q=supra-worldly%20concentration&f=false |author=Joseph Ratzinger |title=Eschatology: Death and Eternal Life |publisher=CUA Press |year=2007 |p=230|isbn=9780813215167 }}</ref>\n\nThe speculations and popular imaginings that, especially in late medieval times, were common in the Western or [[Latin Church]] have not necessarily found acceptance in the [[eastern Catholic Churches]], of which there are 23 in [[full communion]] with the Pope. Some have explicitly rejected the notions of punishment by fire in a particular place that are prominent in the popular picture of purgatory. The representatives of the [[Orthodox Church]] at the [[Council of Florence]] argued against these notions, while declaring that they do hold that there is a cleansing after death of the souls of the saved and that these are assisted by the prayers of the living: \"If souls depart from this life in faith and charity but marked with some defilements, whether unrepented minor ones or major ones repented of but without having yet borne the fruits of repentance, we believe that within reason they are purified of those faults, but not by some purifying fire and particular punishments in some place.\"<ref>[https://archive.org/details/patrologiaorient15pariuoft/page/40 \"First Speech by Mark, Archbishop of Ephesus, on Purifying Fire\" in ''Patrologia Orientalis'', vol. 15, pp. 40\u201341]</ref> The definition of purgatory adopted by that council excluded the two notions with which the Orthodox disagreed and mentioned only the two points that, they said, were part of their faith also. Accordingly, the agreement, known as the [[Union of Brest]], that formalized the admission of the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]] into the full [[communion (Christian)|communion]] of the Roman Catholic Church stated: \"We shall not debate about purgatory, but we entrust ourselves to the teaching of the Holy Church\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1595brest.html|title=Treaty of Brest, Article 5|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n====Fire====\nFire has an important place in the popular image of purgatory and has been the object of speculation by theologians, speculation to which the article on purgatory in the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' relates the warning by the Council of Trent against \"difficult and subtle questions which tend not to edification.\"<ref name=\"Catholic Encyclopedia on Purgatory\">{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12575a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Purgatory|website=www.newadvent.org}}</ref>\n\nFire has never been included in the Catholic Church's defined doctrine on purgatory, but speculation about it is traditional. \"The tradition of the Church, by reference to certain texts of Scripture, speaks of a cleansing fire.\"<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P2N.HTM#$1BW Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1031]</ref> In this regard the ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' references in particular two New Testament passages: \"If anyone's work is burned up, he will suffer loss, though he himself will be saved, but only as through fire\"<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Corinthians|3:15|ESV}}</ref> and \"so that the tested genuineness of your faith\u2014more precious than gold that perishes though it is tested by fire\u2014may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ\".<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Peter|1:7|ESV}}</ref> Catholic theologians have also cited verses such as \"I will put this third into the fire, and refine them as one refines silver, and test them as gold is tested.

But again do you want to be left behind in the fire on account of the ''hay'', the ''wood'', the ''stubble'', and to receive nothing due you for the ''gold'' and the ''silver'' and ''precious stone''?

Thus the ''[[Summa Theologica]]'' of [[Thomas Aquinas]] considered it probable that purgatory was situated close to hell, so that the same fire that tormented the damned cleansed the just souls in purgatory.<ref>[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/aquinas/summa.AP2_Q1_A2.html ''Summa Theologica'', appendix 2, article 2: \"Whether it is the same place where souls are cleansed, and the damned punished?\"]</ref>\n\nIdeas about the supposed fire of purgatory have changed with time: in the early 20th century the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' reported that, while in the past most theologians had held that the fire of purgatory was in some sense a material fire, though of a nature different from ordinary fire, the view of what then seemed to be the majority of theologians was that the term was to be understood metaphorically.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm#VI|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Hell|website=www.newadvent.org}}</ref>\n\n[[Pope Benedict XVI]] recommended to theologians the presentation of purgatory by Saint [[Catherine of Genoa]], for whom purgatory is not an external but an inner fire: \"The Saint speaks of the soul's journey of purification on the way to full communion with God, starting from her own experience of profound sorrow for the sins committed, in comparison with God's infinite love. [...] 'The soul', Catherine says, 'presents itself to God still bound to the desires and suffering that derive from sin and this makes it impossible for it to enjoy the [[beatific vision]] of God'. Catherine asserts that God is so pure and holy that a soul stained by sin cannot be in the presence of the divine majesty. We too feel how distant we are, how full we are of so many things that we cannot see God. The soul is aware of the immense love and perfect justice of God and consequently suffers for having failed to respond in a correct and perfect way to this love; and love for God itself becomes a flame, love itself cleanses it from the residue of sin.\"<ref>[http://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/audiences/2011/documents/hf_ben-xvi_aud_20110112.html Pope Benedict XVI, General Audience of 12 January 2011]</ref>\n\nIn his 2007 encyclical ''Spe salvi'', Pope Benedict XVI, referring to the words of [[Paul the Apostle]] in {{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|3:12\u201315|ESV}} about a fire that both burns and saves, spoke of the opinion that \"the fire which both burns and saves is Christ himself, the Judge and Saviour. The encounter with him is the decisive act of judgement. Before his gaze all falsehood melts away. This encounter with him, as it burns us, transforms and frees us, allowing us to become truly ourselves. All that we build during our lives can prove to be mere straw, pure bluster, and it collapses. Yet in the pain of this encounter, when the impurity and sickness of our lives become evident to us, there lies salvation. His gaze, the touch of his heart heals us through an undeniably painful transformation 'as through fire'. But it is a blessed pain, in which the holy power of his love sears through us like a flame, enabling us to become totally ourselves and thus totally of God. In this way the inter-relation between justice and grace also becomes clear: the way we live our lives is not immaterial, but our defilement does not stain us for ever if we have at least continued to reach out towards Christ, towards truth and towards love. Indeed, it has already been burned away through Christ's Passion. At the moment of judgement we experience and we absorb the overwhelming power of his love over all the evil in the world and in ourselves. The pain of love becomes our salvation and our joy. It is clear that we cannot calculate the 'duration' of this transforming burning in terms of the chronological measurements of this world. The transforming 'moment' of this encounter eludes earthly time-reckoning \u2014 it is the heart's time, it is the time of 'passage' to communion with God in the Body of Christ.\"<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/encyclicals/documents/hf_ben-xvi_enc_20071130_spe-salvi_en.html Encyclical ''Spe salvi''], 46\u201347].</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Peter Paul Rubens 172.jpg | Purgatory, by [[Peter Paul Rubens]]\nFile:Concepcion Santa Cruz 09.jpg | Altar in [[Iglesia de la Concepci\u00f3n (Santa Cruz de Tenerife)|Iglesia de la Concepci\u00f3n]], [[Santa Cruz de Tenerife]]\nFile:Folio 113v - Purgatory.jpg | A fiery purgatory in the ''[[Tr\u00e8s riches heures du Duc de Berry]]''\nFile:V.Carmen de Beniajan-general.jpg | [[Our Lady of Mount Carmel]] and purgatory, [[Beniaj\u00e1n]], [[Spain]]\nFile:LadyOfMtCarmelWithSufferingSouls.jpg | [[Our Lady of Mount Carmel]] and purgatory, [[North End, Boston]]\nFile:Auhausen St. Maria 473gf.JPG | Detail of altar in Lutheran church in [[Auhausen]], [[Bavaria]]\nFile:AMR Kirche - Altar 3.jpg | Our Lady, St Monica and souls in purgatory, [[Rattenberg]], [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]]\nFile:Kientzheim StFelix 30.JPG | Our Lady of Passau in St Felix Church, [[Kientzheim]], [[Alsace]]\nFile:Heidelberg cpg 144 Els\u00e4ssische Legenda Aurea 338r St. Patricks Fegefeuer.jpg | Purgatory, 1419 drawing by unknown artist from [[Strasbourg]]\nFile:Michel-Serre-Vierge \u00e0 l'enfant et le purgatoire.jpg | Painting by [[Michel Serre]] in the Saint Cannat Church, [[Marseilles]]\nFile:Wimpfen-stadtkirche-predell.jpg |Altar predella in the town church of [[Bad Wimpfen]], [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]]\nFile:Mantlach - Velburg NM 002.JPG | Request for prayer for the souls in purgatory\nFile:Catedral de San Juan Bautista de Puerto Rico - DSC06866.JPG | Stained-glass window in [[Puerto Rico]] Cathedral\nFile:Cristobal Rojas 46a.JPG | Purgatory by Venezuelan painter [[Crist\u00f3bal Rojas (artist)|Crist\u00f3bal Rojas]] (1890)\nFile:St.Ulrich am Pillersee - Deckenfresko 1a.jpg | Ceiling of St Ulrich Church in [[Pillersee]], [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]], Austria\nFile:Andrea Vaccaro - The Virgin intercedes for the Souls in Purgatory.jpg |Our Lady Interceding for the Souls in Purgatory, by [[Andrea Vaccaro]]\nFile:Stephan Lochner Souls in Purgatory.jpg | Miniature by [[Stefan Lochner]] showing souls in purgatory\nFile:\u00c1nimas Benditas.jpg | [[Azulejo]] of souls in purgatory, [[Seville]], [[Spain]]\n</gallery>\n\n==== Popular notion of purgatory as a place ====\n[[File:William Frederick Wakeman Lough Derg.png|thumb|The island of St Patrick's Purgatory]]\nIn his ''La naissance du Purgatoire'' (''The Birth of Purgatory''), [[Jacques Le Goff]] attributes the origin of the idea of a third other-world domain, similar to heaven and hell, called Purgatory, to Paris intellectuals and [[Cistercians|Cistercian monks]] at some point in the last three decades of the twelfth century, possibly as early as 1170\u22121180. Previously, the [[Latin]] adjective ''purgatorius'', as in ''purgatorius ignis'' (cleansing fire) existed, but only then did the noun ''purgatorium'' appear, used as the name of a place called Purgatory.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=4dzynjFfX7kC&dq=Goff+birth+purgatory&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwirwrjM89HfAhVjtnEKHTUNBMoQ6AEIKDAA Jacques Le Goff, ''The Birth of Purgatory'' (University of Chicago Press 1986), pp. 167\u2212168]</ref>\n\nThe change happened at about the same time as the composition of the book ''[[Tractatus de Purgatorio Sancti Patricii]]'', an account by an English Cistercian of a penitent knight's visit to the land of purgatory reached through a cave in the island known as Station Island or [[St Patrick's Purgatory]] in the lake of [[Lough Derg (Donegal)|Lough Derg]], [[County Donegal]], [[Ireland]].

The painter was likely Jacopo di Mino del Pellicciaio, and the date of the fresco is around 1345. Purgatory is shown as a rocky hill filled with separate openings into its hollow center. Above the mountain St Patrick introduces the prayers of the faithful that can help attenuate the sufferings of the souls undergoing purification. In each opening, sinners are tormented by demons and by fire. Each of the seven deadly sins \u2013 avarice, envy, sloth, pride, anger, lust, and gluttony \u2013 has its own region of purgatory and its own appropriate tortures. \n\n[[File:Dante03.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Dante gazes at purgatory (shown as a mountain) in this 16th-century painting.]]\nLe Goff dedicates the final chapter of his book to the ''Purgatorio'', the second book in [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s fourteenth-century ''[[The Divine Comedy|La divina commedia]]'' (''The Divine Comedy''). In an interview Le Goff declared: \"Dante's ''Purgatorio'' represents the sublime conclusion of the slow development of Purgatory that took place in the course of the Middle Ages. The power of Dante's poetry made a decisive contribution to fixing in the public imagination this 'third place', whose birth was on the whole quite recent.\"<ref>[https://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2005/09/27/invenzione-del-purgatorio.html Fabio Gambaro, \"L'invenzione del purgatorio\" in ''La Repubblica'', 27 September 2005]</ref>\n\nDante pictures purgatory as an island at the [[antipodes]] of Jerusalem, pushed up, in an otherwise empty sea, by the displacement caused by the fall of Satan, which left him fixed at the central point of the globe of the Earth. The cone-shaped island has seven terraces on which souls are cleansed from the [[seven deadly sins]] or capital vices as they ascend. Additional spurs at the base hold those for whom beginning the ascent is delayed because in life they were excommunicates, indolent or late repenters. At the summit is the [[Garden of Eden|earthly paradise]], from where the souls, cleansed of evil tendencies and made perfect, are taken to heaven.\n\nThe Catholic Church has not included in its teaching this idea of purgatory as a place, any more than it has sealed with its authority the idea of a [[Limbo]], which also has been postulated by some theologians.\n\nOn 4 August 1999, [[Pope John Paul II]], speaking of purgatory, said: \"The term does not indicate a place, but a condition of existence. Those who, after death, exist in a state of purification, are already in the love of Christ who removes from them the remnants of imperfection as \"a condition of existence\".<ref name=\"Audience of 4 August 1999\"/>\n\nSimilarly in 2011, [[Pope Benedict XVI]], speaking of Saint [[Catherine of Genoa]] (1447\u20131510) in relation to purgatory, said that \"In her day it was depicted mainly using images linked to space: a certain space was conceived of in which purgatory was supposed to be located.

According to the [[Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America]]:\n\n<blockquote>The moral progress of the soul, either for better or for worse, ends at the very moment of the separation of the body and soul; at that very moment the definite destiny of the soul in the everlasting life is decided. ...There is no way of repentance, no way of escape, no reincarnation and no help from the outside world. Its place is decided forever by its Creator and judge. The Orthodox Church does not believe in purgatory (a place of purging), that is, the inter-mediate state after death in which the souls of the saved (those who have not received temporal punishment for their sins) are purified of all taint preparatory to entering into Heaven, where every soul is perfect and fit to see God. Also, the Orthodox Church does not believe in indulgences as remissions from purgatorial punishment. Both purgatory and indulgences are inter-corelated theories, unwitnessed in the Bible or in the Ancient Church, and when they were enforced and applied they brought about evil practices at the expense of the prevailing Truths of the Church. If Almighty God in His merciful loving-kindness changes the dreadful situation of the sinner, it is unknown to the Church of Christ. The Church lived for fifteen hundred years without such a theory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goarch.org/ourfaith/ourfaith7076|title=Death, the Threshold to Eternal Life - Liturgy & Worship - Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America|website=www.goarch.org}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nEastern Orthodox teaching is that, while all undergo an [[particular judgment|individual judgment]] immediately after death, neither the just nor the wicked attain the final state of bliss or punishment before the Last Day,<ref>John Meyondorff, ''Byzantine Theology'' (London: Mowbrays, 1974) pp. 220\u2013221. \"At death man's body goes to the earth from which it was taken, and the soul, being immortal, goes to God, who gave it.

The general Protestant view is that the Bible, from which Protestants exclude [[deuterocanonical books]] such as [[2 Maccabees]], contains no overt, explicit discussion of purgatory and therefore it should be rejected as an unbiblical belief.<ref>Robert L.

Rather his basic argument is that, in a phrase he often uses, it \"makes sense.\"<ref>For example, Walls,  2012, p. 71</ref> For Walls, purgatory has a [[logic]], as in the title of his book. He documents the \"contrast between the satisfaction and sanctification models\" of purgatory. In the satisfaction model, \"the punishment of purgatory\" is to satisfy God's justice. In the sanctification model, Wall writes: \"Purgatory might be pictured ... as a regimen to regain one\u2019s spiritual health and get back into moral shape.\"<ref>Walls, 2012, pp. 76, 90.</ref> In Catholic theology Walls finds that the doctrine of purgatory has \"swung\" between the \"poles of satisfaction and sanctification\" sometimes \"combining both elements somewhere in the middle\". He believes the sanctification model \"can be affirmed by Protestants without in any way contradicting their theology\" and that they may find that it \"makes better sense of how the remains of sin are purged\" than an instantaneous cleansing at the moment of death.<ref>Walls 2012, p. 90</ref>\n\nWhile purgatory was disputed by the Reformers, some early patristic theologians of the Eastern Church taught and believed in \"[[apocatastasis]]\", the belief that all creation would be restored to its original perfect condition after a remedial purgatorial reformation.

This place, called \"the spirit world,\" includes \"paradise\" for the righteous and \"prison\" for those who do not know God. Spirits in paradise serve as missionaries to the spirits in prison, who can still accept salvation. In this sense, spirit prison can be conceptualized as a type of purgatory. In addition to hearing the message from the missionary spirits, the spirits in prison can also accept posthumous baptism and other posthumous ordinances performed by living church members in temples on Earth. This is frequently referred to as \"baptism for the dead\" and \"temple work.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christiandataresources.com/mormonbeliefs2.htm|title=What Do Mormons Believe (The God Makers)?|website=www.christiandataresources.com}}</ref> Members of the Church believe that during the three days following Christ's crucifixion, he preached his gospel to inhabitants of spirit prison.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://eom.byu.edu/index.php/Spirit_Prison|title=Spirit Prison - The Encyclopedia of Mormonism|website=eom.byu.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-05-17}}</ref>\n\n==Judaism==\nIn [[Judaism]], [[Gehenna]] is a place of purification where, according to some traditions, most sinners spend up to a year before release.\n\nThe view of purgatory can be found in the teaching of the Shammaites: \"In the last judgment day there shall be three classes of souls: the righteous shall at once be written down for the life everlasting; the wicked, for Gehenna; but those whose virtues and sins counterbalance one another shall go down to Gehenna and float up and down until they rise purified; for of them it is said: 'I will bring the third part into the fire and refine them as silver is refined, and try them as gold is tried' [Zech. xiii. 9.]; also, 'He [the Lord] bringeth down to Sheol and bringeth up again'\" (I Sam. ii. 6). The Hillelites seem to have had no purgatory; for they said: \"He who is 'plenteous in mercy' [Ex. xxxiv. 6.] inclines the balance toward mercy, and consequently the intermediates do not descend into Gehenna\" (Tosef., Sanh. xiii. 3; R. H. 16b; Bacher, \"Ag. Tan.\" i. 18). Still they also speak of an intermediate state.\n\nRegarding the time which purgatory lasts, the accepted opinion of R. Akiba is twelve months; according to R. Johanan b. Nuri, it is only forty-nine days. Both opinions are based upon Isa. lxvi. 23\u201324: \"From one new moon to another and from one Sabbath to another shall all flesh come to worship before Me, and they shall go forth and look upon the carcasses of the men that have transgressed against Me; for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched\"; the former interpreting the words \"from one new moon to another\" to signify all the months of a year; the latter interpreting the words \"from one Sabbath to another,\" in accordance with Lev. xxiii. 15\u201316, to signify seven weeks. During the twelve months, declares the baraita (Tosef., Sanh. xiii. 4\u20135; R. H. 16b), the souls of the wicked are judged, and after these twelve months are over they are consumed and transformed into ashes under the feet of the righteous (according to Mal. iii. 21 [A. V. iv. 3]), whereas the great seducers and blasphemers are to undergo eternal tortures in Gehenna without cessation (according to Isa. lxvi. 24).\n\nThe righteous, however, and, according to some, also the sinners among the people of Israel for whom Abraham intercedes because they bear the Abrahamic sign of the covenant are not harmed by the fire of Gehenna even when they are required to pass through the intermediate state of purgatory ('Er. 19b; \u1e24ag. 27a).<ref>\"There are three categories of men; the wholly pious and the arch-sinners are not purified, but only those between these two classes\" ([http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=115&letter=G Jewish Encyclopedia: Gehenna])</ref>\n\n[[Maimonides]] declares, in [[Jewish principles of faith#Maimonides' 13 principles of faith|his 13 principles of faith]], that the descriptions of Gehenna, as a place of punishment in rabbinic literature, were pedagocically motivated inventions to encourage respect of the [[Torah]] commandements by mankind, which had been regarded as immature.<ref name=\"perek-helek-d\">Maimonides\u2019 Introduction to Perek Helek, publ. and transl. by [[Maimonides Heritage Center]], p. 3\u20134.</ref> Instead of being sent to Gehenna, the souls of the wicked would actually get annihilated.<ref name=\"perek-helek-c\">Maimonides\u2019 Introduction to Perek Helek, publ. and transl. by [[Maimonides Heritage Center]], p. 22-23.</ref>\n\n== Islam ==\n{{main article|Barzakh}}\nIslam has a concept similar to that of purgatory in Christianity.

Soon, Holy Roman Imperial forces joined the battle and conquered the members of the [[Schmalkaldic League]], oppressing and exiling many German Lutherans as they enforced the terms of the [[Augsburg Interim]]. Religious freedom in some areas was secured for Lutherans through the [[Peace of Passau]] in 1552, and under the legal principle of ''[[Cuius regio, eius religio]]'' (the religion of the ruler was to dictate the religion of those ruled) and the [[Declaratio Ferdinandei]] (limited religious tolerance) clauses of the [[Peace of Augsburg]] in 1555.<ref>Fuerbringer, L., ''[https://archive.org/details/concordiacyclope009499mbp Concordia Cyclopedia]'' [[Concordia Publishing House]]. 1927. p. 425</ref>\n[[File:Toleranzbethaus Fresach, copy Hundskirche in der Kreuzen.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|alt=|A Hundskirche replica]]\n\nReligious disputes between the [[Crypto-Calvinism|Crypto-Calvinists]], [[Philippists]], [[Sacramentarians]], [[Ubiquitarians]] and [[Gnesio-Lutherans]] raged within Lutheranism during the middle of the 16th century. This finally ended with the resolution of the issues in the ''[[Formula of Concord]]''. Large numbers of politically and religiously influential leaders met together, debated, and resolved these topics on the basis of Scripture, resulting in the Formula, which over 8,000 leaders signed. The ''[[Book of Concord]]'' replaced earlier, incomplete [[Body of Doctrine|collections of doctrine]], unifying all German Lutherans with identical doctrine and beginning the period of Lutheran Orthodoxy.\n\nIn lands where Catholicism was the state religion, Lutheranism was officially illegal, although enforcement varied. Until the end of the [[Counter-Reformation#Politics|Counter-Reformation]], some Lutherans worshipped secretly, such as at the Hundskirke (which translates as dog church or dog altar). It is a triangle-shaped [[Mass rock|Communion rock]] in a ditch between crosses in [[Paternion]], Austria. The crowned serpent is possibly an allusion to [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor]], while the dog possibly refers to [[Peter Canisius]]. Another figure interpreted as a snail carrying a church tower is possibly a metaphor for the Protestant church. Also on the rock is the number 1599 and a phrase translating as \"thus gets in the world.\"<ref>This photograph is of a replica of the original Hundskirche stone.

[[Lutheran scholasticism]] developed gradually especially for the purpose of arguing with the [[Jesuits]], and it was finally established by [[Johann Gerhard]].

After a century of vitality, the Pietist theologians [[Philipp Jakob Spener]] and [[August Hermann Francke]] warned that orthodoxy had degenerated into meaningless intellectualism and [[Formalism (philosophy)#Religion|formalism]], while orthodox theologians found the emotional and subjective focuses of Pietism to be vulnerable to Rationalist propaganda.<ref name=CC426>Fuerbringer, L., ''[https://archive.org/details/concordiacyclope009499mbp Concordia Cyclopedia]'' Concordia Publishing House. 1927. p. 426</ref> In 1688, the Finnish [[Radical Pietism|Radical Pietist]] [[Lars Ulstadius]] ran down the main aisle of [[Turku Cathedral]] naked while screaming that the disgrace of Finnish clergymen would be revealed, like his current disgrace.\n\nThe last famous orthodox Lutheran theologian before the rationalist ''Aufkl\u00e4rung'', or ''Enlightenment'', was [[David Hollatz (dogmatician)|David Hollatz]].

As Lutherans and Orthodox we affirm that the teachings of the ecumenical councils are authoritative for our churches....The Seventh Ecumenical Council, the Second Council of Nicaea in 787, which rejected iconoclasm and restored the veneration of icons in the churches, was not part of the tradition received by the Reformation. Lutherans, however, rejected the iconoclasm of the 16th century, and affirmed the distinction between adoration due to the Triune God alone and all other forms of veneration (CA 21). Through historical research this council has become better known.  Nevertheless it does not have the same significance for Lutherans as it does for the Orthodox. Yet, Lutherans and Orthodox are in agreement that the Second Council of Nicaea confirms the christological teaching of the earlier councils and in setting forth the role of images (icons) in the lives of the faithful reaffirms the reality of the incarnation of the eternal Word of God, when it states: \"The more frequently, Christ, Mary, the mother of God, and the saints are seen, the more are those who see them drawn to remember and long for those who serve as models, and to pay these icons the tribute of salutation and respectful veneration. Certainly this is not the full adoration in accordance with our faith, which is properly paid only to the divine nature, but it resembles that given to the figure of the honored and life-giving cross, and also to the holy books of the gospels and to other sacred objects\" (Definition of the Second Council of Nicaea).}}</ref><ref name=\"Kelly2009\">{{cite book|title=Ecumenical Council|publisher=Titi Tudorancea Encyclopedia|year=1991\u20132016|url=https://www.tititudorancea.net/z/ecumenical_council.htm|quote=The Lutheran World Federation, in ecumenical dialogues with the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople has affirmed all of the first seven councils as ecumenical and authoritative.}}</ref> The ''[[Augsburg Confession]]'' teaches that \"the faith as confessed by Luther and his followers is nothing new, but the true catholic faith, and that their churches represent the true catholic or universal church\".<ref name=\"Ludwig2016\">{{cite magazine|title=Luther's Catholic Reformation|last=Ludwig|first=Alan|date=12 September 2016|magazine=The Lutheran Witness|language=English|quote=When the Lutherans presented the ''Augsburg Confession'' before Emperor Charles V in 1530, they carefully showed that each article of faith and practice was true first of all to Holy Scripture, and then also to the teaching of the church fathers and the councils and even the canon law of the Church of Rome. They boldly claim, \"This is about the Sum of our Doctrine, in which, as can be seen, there is nothing that varies from the Scriptures, or from the Church Catholic, or from the Church of Rome as known from its writers\" (AC XXI Conclusion 1).

Lutherans believe that the actual body and blood of Jesus Christ are present in, with and under the bread and the wine. This belief is called [[Real Presence]] or [[sacramental union]] and is different from [[consubstantiation]] and [[transubstantiation]]. Additionally Lutherans reject the idea that communion is a mere symbol or [[Memorialism|memorial]]. They confess in the ''[[Apology of the Augsburg Confession]]'':\n<blockquote>[W]e do not abolish the Mass but religiously keep and defend it. Among us the Mass is celebrated every Lord's Day and on other [[s:Augsburg Confession#Article XV: Of Ecclesiastical Usages.|festivals]], when the Sacrament is made available to those who wish to partake of it, after they have been examined and absolved. We also keep traditional liturgical forms, such as the order of readings, prayers, vestments, and other similar things.<ref>''Apology of the Augsburg Confession'', Article XXIV.1</ref></blockquote>Besides the Holy Communion (Divine Service), congregations also hold offices, which are worship services without communion. They may include [[Matins in Lutheranism|Matins]], [[Vespers in Lutheranism|Vespers]], [[Compline]], and [[Easter Vigil#Lutheran churches|Easter Vigil]].

These services were in a variety of styles, depending on the preferences of the congregation. Often they were held alongside a traditional service in order to cater to those who preferred [[contemporary worship music]]. Today, few but some Lutheran congregations have contemporary worship as their sole form of worship.

As part of [[denazification]] the Reich Church was formally done away with in 1945, and certain clergy were removed from their positions. However, the merger between the Lutheran, United, and Reformed state churches was retained under the name [[Evangelical Church in Germany]] (EKD). In 1948 the Lutheran church bodies within the EKD founded the [[United Evangelical Lutheran Church of Germany]] (VELKD), but it has since been reduced from being an independent legal entity to an administrative unit within the EKD.\n\nPresently, Lutherans are divided over how to interact with other Christian denominations.

[[North Dakota District (LCMS)|North Dakota District of The Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod]], 1968.</ref> before pastors can share each other's pulpits, and before communicants commune at each other's altars, a practice termed [[closed communion|closed (or close) communion]].

These organizations together account for the great majority of Lutheran denominations. The [[Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod|LCMS]] and the [[Lutheran Church\u2013Canada]] are members of the ILC. The [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod|WELS]] and [[Evangelical Lutheran Synod|ELS]] are members of the CELC. Many Lutheran churches are not affiliated with the LWF, the ILC or the CELC: The congregations of the [[Church of the Lutheran Confession]] (CLC) are affiliated with their mission organizations in Canada, India, Nepal, Myanmar, and many African nations; and those affiliated with the [[Church of the Lutheran Brethren]] are especially active doing mission work in Africa and East Asia.\n\nThe Lutheran World Federation-aligned churches do not believe that one church is singularly true in its teachings. According to this belief, Lutheranism is a reform movement rather than a movement into doctrinal correctness. As part of this, in 1999 the LWF and the Roman Catholic Church jointly issued a statement, the ''[[Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification]]'', that stated that the LWF and the Catholics both agreed about certain basics of Justification and lifted certain Catholic [[anathema]]s formerly applying to the LWF member churches.{{Citation needed span|The LCMS has participated in most of the [[Lutheran-Roman Catholic dialogue|official dialogues with the Roman Catholic Church]] since shortly after the [[Second Vatican Council]], though not the one which produced the ''Joint Declaration'' and to which they were not invited.

As of 2019, the Forum is not a full communion organization. Similar in this structure is the [[International Lutheran Council]], where issues of communion are left to the individual denominations. Not all ILC churches have declared church-fellowship with each other. In contrast, mutual church-fellowship is part of the CELC member churches, and unlike in the LWF, this is not contradicted by individual statements from any particular member church body.\n\n[[File:L\u00e6stardianer.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|L\u00e6stadian lay preacher from [[Finnmark]], Norway, 1898|alt=]]\n\n[[Laestadianism|Laestadians]] within certain European state churches maintain close ties to other Laestadians, often called Apostolic Lutherans.

The occasional ordination of a bishop by a priest was not necessarily considered an invalid ordination in the Middle Ages, so the alleged break in the line of succession in the other Nordic Churches would have been considered a violation of canon law rather than an invalid ordination at the time.

Eastern Orthodox Laestadians are known as [[:ru:\u0423\u0448\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0439\u0437\u0435\u0442|Ushkovayzet]] (article is in Russian).<ref>[http://uralistica.com/profiles/blogs/karelskoe-religioznoe Karelian religious movement Uskhovayzet]</ref>\n\n====Eastern Europe and Asian Russia====\n[[File:Spb 06-2012 Nevsky various 06.jpg|thumb|[[Lutheran Church of Saint Peter and Saint Paul]] in St. Petersburg]]\nAlthough historically Pietism had a significant influence on the understanding of the ministry among Lutherans in the Russian Empire,{{efn|See [[:ru:\u0412\u044e\u0441\u0442,_\u042d\u0434\u0443\u0430\u0440\u0434|Edward Wust]] and [[:ru:\u0412\u044e\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0437\u043c|Wustism]] in the Russian Wikipedia for more on this.}} today nearly all Russian and Ukrainian Lutherans are influenced by Eastern Orthodox polity. In their culture, giving a high degree of respect and authority to their bishops is necessary for their faith to be seen as legitimate and not sectarian.<ref>[https://www.sonntagsblatt.de/artikel/kirche/ihre-gemeinde-ist-annulliert Kirche weltweit Ukraine: \"Ihre Gemeinde ist annulliert\"] 18.09.2016 by Von Helmut Frank]</ref> In Russia, lines of succession between bishops and the canonical authority between their present-day hierarchy is also carefully maintained in order to legitimize the existing Lutheran churches as present day successors of the former Lutheran Church of the Russian Empire originally authorized by Catherine the Great. This allows for the post-Soviet repatriation of Lutheran church buildings to local congregations on the basis of this historical connection.<ref>[https://logia.org/pdf-back-issues/15-1pdf-lutheranism-in-asia A New \"Old\" Lutheran Church in Asian Russia] by Alexei Streltsov, in Logia, Epiphany 2006: Volume 15, Number 1</ref>\n\n====Germany====\nIn Germany, several dynamics encouraged Lutherans to maintain a different form of polity. First, due to de facto practice during the [[Nuremberg Religious Peace]] the subsequent legal principal of [[Cuius regio, eius religio]] in the 1555 Peace of Augsburg, German states were officially either Catholic or \"Evangelical\" (that is, Lutheran under the ''Augsburg Confession''). In some areas both Catholic and Lutheran churches were permitted to co-exist. Because German speaking Catholic areas were nearby Catholic leaning Christians were able to emigrate and there was less of an issue with Catholics choosing to live as [[crypto-papist]]s in Lutheran areas. Although Reformed leaning Christians were not allowed to have churches, Melancthon wrote ''[[Augsburg Confession Variata]]'' which some used to claim legal protection as \"Evangelical\" churches. Many chose to live as [[crypto-Calvinists]] either with or without the protection offered by the ''Variata'', but this did not make their influence go away, and as a result the Protestant church in Germany as of 2017 was only about ~40% Lutheran, with most of the rest being United Protestant, a combination of Lutheran and Reformed beliefs and practices.<ref name=EKD18>[https://www.ekd.de/ekd_de/ds_doc/Gezaehlt_zahlen_und_fakten_2019.pdf Zahlen und Fakte zum kirchlichen Leben 2019] Evangelische Kirche in Deutschland</ref>\n\n[[File:KirchenordnungSHA.jpg|thumb|left|[[Schw\u00e4bisch Hall]] Church Order, 1543|alt=]]\nIn terms of polity, over 17th and 18th centuries the carefully negotiated and highly prescriptive [[Church Order (Lutheran)|church orders]] of the Reformation era gave way to a joint cooperation between state control and a Reformed-style blend of consistorial and presbyterian type synodical governance. Just as negotiations over the details in the church orders involved the laity, so did the new synodical governance. Synodical governance had already been practiced in the Reformed Netherlands prior to its adoption by Lutherans. During the formation of the modern German state, ideas about the nature of authority and the best design for governments and organizations came from the philosophies [[Political philosophy of Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Elements of the Philosophy of Right|Hegel]], further modifying the polity. When the monarchy and the sovereign governance of the church was ended in 1918, the synods took over the governance of the state churches.\n\n====Western Hemisphere and Australia====\n[[File:Ministerium Hymnal.jpg|thumb|right|The Pennsylvania Ministerium published this 1803 hymnal.<ref>This website has [https://hymnary.org/hymnal/HELC1865 text and midi files] for the 1865 Pennsylvania Ministerium hymnal.</ref>]]\nDuring the period of the emigration, Lutherans took their existing ideas about polity with them across the ocean,<ref>Abdel Ross Wentz (1954), ''A Basic History of Lutheranism in America'', Philadelphia, Pa., p. 41</ref><ref>Clifton E. Olmstead (1960), ''History of Religion in the United States'', Englewood Cliffs, N.J., pp. 6, 140</ref> though with the exception of the early Swedish Lutherans immigrants of the New Sweden colony who accepted the rule of the Anglican bishops and became part of the established church, they now had to fund churches on their own. This increased the congregationalist dynamic in the blended consistorial and presbyterian type synodical governance. The first organized church body of Lutherans in America was the [[Pennsylvania Ministerium]], which used Reformed style synodical governance over the 18th and 19th centuries. Their contribution to the development of polity was that smaller synods could in turn form a larger body, also with synodical governance, but without losing their lower level of governance. As a result, the smaller synods gained unprecedented flexibility to join, leave, merge, or stay separate, all without the hand of the state as had been the case in Europe.\n\nDuring their 19th century persecution, Old Lutheran believers were left in a bind. Resistance to authority was disobedient, but upholding the true doctrine and right practice was also disobedient. Fortunately the doctrine of the [[lesser magistrate]] could be employed, whereby clergy could legitimately resist the state and even leave. illegal free churches were set up in Germany and mass emigration occurred. For decades the new churches were mostly dependent on the free churches to send them new ministerial candidates for ordination. These new church bodies also employed synodical governance, but tended to exclude Hegelianism in their constitutions due to its incompatibility with the doctrine of the lesser magistrates. In contrast to Hegelianism where authority flows in from all levels, Kantianism presents authority flowing only from the top down, hence the need for a lesser magistrate to become the new top magistrate.\n\n[[File:Lighthouse Lutheran Church in Freedom.jpg|thumb|Lighthouse Lutheran Church, an LCMC congregation in [[Freedom, Pennsylvania]]|alt=]]\nOver the 20th and 20th century, some Lutheran bodies have adopted a more congregationalist approach, such as the [[Protest'ant Conference]] and the [[Lutheran Congregations in Mission for Christ]], or LCMC. The LCMC formed due to a church split after the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America signed an [[Called to Common Mission|agreement]] with the Episcopalians to start ordaining all of their new bishops into the Episcopalian Apostolic succession. In other words, this meant that new ELCA bishops, at least at first, would be jointly ordained by Anglican bishops as well as Lutheran bishops so that the more strict Episcopalians would recognize their sacraments as valid. This was offensive to some in the ELCA at the time because of the implications this had on the [[Theology of Martin Luther#Universal priesthood of the baptized|priesthood of all believers]] and the nature of ordination.\n\nToday, some churches allow dual-rostering.<ref>For example, the single Lutheran church on the island of Guam is a member of the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod and the Lutheran Congregations in Mission for Christ. See [http://www.lutheranchurchofguam.org/blog/?page_id=890 Lutheran Church of Guam History]</ref> Situations like this one where a church or church body belongs to multiple larger organizations that do not have ties are termed \"triangular fellowship.\" Another variant are independent Lutheran churches, although for some independent churches the clergy are members of a larger denomination. In other cases, a congregation may belong to a synod, but the pastor may be unaffiliated.<ref>For example, [http://www.trinitynewhaven.com Trinity New Haven, MO] is a member congregation of the Missouri Synod even though their pastor is independent. This congregation was expelled from the Missouri Synod for a while over this, but they challenged it and got back in.</ref> In the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America,<ref>Due to influence from former Missourians joining the ELCA in the [[American Evangelical Lutheran Church]]</ref> the Wisconsin Synod, the Evangelical Lutheran Synod, the Church of the Lutheran Confession, and the Missouri Synod, teachers at parochial schools are considered to be clergy, with the latter defending this before the [[Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church & School v.

Soon, Holy Roman Imperial forces joined the battle and conquered the members of the [[Schmalkaldic League]], oppressing and exiling many German Lutherans as they enforced the terms of the [[Augsburg Interim]]. Religious freedom in some areas was secured for Lutherans through the [[Peace of Passau]] in 1552, and under the legal principle of ''[[Cuius regio, eius religio]]'' (the religion of the ruler was to dictate the religion of those ruled) and the [[Declaratio Ferdinandei]] (limited religious tolerance) clauses of the [[Peace of Augsburg]] in 1555.<ref>Fuerbringer, L., ''[https://archive.org/details/concordiacyclope009499mbp Concordia Cyclopedia]'' [[Concordia Publishing House]]. 1927. p. 425</ref>\n[[File:Toleranzbethaus Fresach, copy Hundskirche in der Kreuzen.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|alt=|A Hundskirche replica]]\n\nReligious disputes between the [[Crypto-Calvinism|Crypto-Calvinists]], [[Philippists]], [[Sacramentarians]], [[Ubiquitarians]] and [[Gnesio-Lutherans]] raged within Lutheranism during the middle of the 16th century. This finally ended with the resolution of the issues in the ''[[Formula of Concord]]''. Large numbers of politically and religiously influential leaders met together, debated, and resolved these topics on the basis of Scripture, resulting in the Formula, which over 8,000 leaders signed. The ''[[Book of Concord]]'' replaced earlier, incomplete [[Body of Doctrine|collections of doctrine]], unifying all German Lutherans with identical doctrine and beginning the period of Lutheran Orthodoxy.\n\nIn lands where Catholicism was the state religion, Lutheranism was officially illegal, although enforcement varied. Until the end of the [[Counter-Reformation#Politics|Counter-Reformation]], some Lutherans worshipped secretly, such as at the Hundskirke (which translates as dog church or dog altar). It is a triangle-shaped [[Mass rock|Communion rock]] in a ditch between crosses in [[Paternion]], Austria. The crowned serpent is possibly an allusion to [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor]], while the dog possibly refers to [[Peter Canisius]]. Another figure interpreted as a snail carrying a church tower is possibly a metaphor for the Protestant church.

As Lutherans and Orthodox we affirm that the teachings of the ecumenical councils are authoritative for our churches....The Seventh Ecumenical Council, the Second Council of Nicaea in 787, which rejected iconoclasm and restored the veneration of icons in the churches, was not part of the tradition received by the Reformation. Lutherans, however, rejected the iconoclasm of the 16th century, and affirmed the distinction between adoration due to the Triune God alone and all other forms of veneration (CA 21). Through historical research this council has become better known.  Nevertheless it does not have the same significance for Lutherans as it does for the Orthodox. Yet, Lutherans and Orthodox are in agreement that the Second Council of Nicaea confirms the christological teaching of the earlier councils and in setting forth the role of images (icons) in the lives of the faithful reaffirms the reality of the incarnation of the eternal Word of God, when it states: \"The more frequently, Christ, Mary, the mother of God, and the saints are seen, the more are those who see them drawn to remember and long for those who serve as models, and to pay these icons the tribute of salutation and respectful veneration. Certainly this is not the full adoration in accordance with our faith, which is properly paid only to the divine nature, but it resembles that given to the figure of the honored and life-giving cross, and also to the holy books of the gospels and to other sacred objects\" (Definition of the Second Council of Nicaea).}}</ref><ref name=\"Kelly2009\">{{cite book|title=Ecumenical Council|publisher=Titi Tudorancea Encyclopedia|year=1991\u20132016|url=https://www.tititudorancea.net/z/ecumenical_council.htm|quote=The Lutheran World Federation, in ecumenical dialogues with the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople has affirmed all of the first seven councils as ecumenical and authoritative.}}</ref> The ''[[Augsburg Confession]]'' teaches that \"the faith as confessed by Luther and his followers is nothing new, but the true catholic faith, and that their churches represent the true catholic or universal church\".<ref name=\"Ludwig2016\">{{cite magazine|title=Luther's Catholic Reformation|last=Ludwig|first=Alan|date=12 September 2016|magazine=The Lutheran Witness|language=English|quote=When the Lutherans presented the ''Augsburg Confession'' before Emperor Charles V in 1530, they carefully showed that each article of faith and practice was true first of all to Holy Scripture, and then also to the teaching of the church fathers and the councils and even the canon law of the Church of Rome.

Martin Luther was a great fan of music, and this is why it forms a large part of Lutheran services; in particular, Luther admired the composers [[Josquin des Prez]] and [[Ludwig Senfl]] and wanted singing in the church to move away from the ''ars perfecta'' (Catholic Sacred Music of the late Renaissance) and towards singing as a ''[[Gemeinschaft]]'' (community).<ref>Taruskin, Richard.

Lutherans believe that the actual body and blood of Jesus Christ are present in, with and under the bread and the wine. This belief is called [[Real Presence]] or [[sacramental union]] and is different from [[consubstantiation]] and [[transubstantiation]]. Additionally Lutherans reject the idea that communion is a mere symbol or [[Memorialism|memorial]]. They confess in the ''[[Apology of the Augsburg Confession]]'':\n<blockquote>[W]e do not abolish the Mass but religiously keep and defend it. Among us the Mass is celebrated every Lord's Day and on other [[s:Augsburg Confession#Article XV: Of Ecclesiastical Usages.|festivals]], when the Sacrament is made available to those who wish to partake of it, after they have been examined and absolved. We also keep traditional liturgical forms, such as the order of readings, prayers, vestments, and other similar things.<ref>''Apology of the Augsburg Confession'', Article XXIV.1</ref></blockquote>Besides the Holy Communion (Divine Service), congregations also hold offices, which are worship services without communion. They may include [[Matins in Lutheranism|Matins]], [[Vespers in Lutheranism|Vespers]], [[Compline]], and [[Easter Vigil#Lutheran churches|Easter Vigil]].

Often they were held alongside a traditional service in order to cater to those who preferred [[contemporary worship music]]. Today, few but some Lutheran congregations have contemporary worship as their sole form of worship.

Prior to this time, the two Lutheran church bodies in Australia ([[History of the Lutheran Church of Australia#Merge of UELCA and ELCA into the Lutheran Church of Australia|which merged in 1966]]) used a bewildering variety of hymnals, usually in the German language.

They condemned the Philippist position for [[indifferentism]], describing it as a \"unionistic compromise\" of precious Reformation theology. Instead, they held that genuine unity between Christians and real theological peace was only possible with an honest agreement about every subject of doctrinal controversy.<ref>Klug, Eugene F. and Stahlke, Otto F.

As part of [[denazification]] the Reich Church was formally done away with in 1945, and certain clergy were removed from their positions. However, the merger between the Lutheran, United, and Reformed state churches was retained under the name [[Evangelical Church in Germany]] (EKD). In 1948 the Lutheran church bodies within the EKD founded the [[United Evangelical Lutheran Church of Germany]] (VELKD), but it has since been reduced from being an independent legal entity to an administrative unit within the EKD.\n\nPresently, Lutherans are divided over how to interact with other Christian denominations. Some Lutherans assert that everyone must share the \"whole counsel of God\" (Acts 20:27) in complete unity (1 Cor. 1:10)<ref>For a historical example, see Robert Preus, ''To Join or Not To Join''.

These organizations together account for the great majority of Lutheran denominations. The [[Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod|LCMS]] and the [[Lutheran Church\u2013Canada]] are members of the ILC. The [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod|WELS]] and [[Evangelical Lutheran Synod|ELS]] are members of the CELC. Many Lutheran churches are not affiliated with the LWF, the ILC or the CELC: The congregations of the [[Church of the Lutheran Confession]] (CLC) are affiliated with their mission organizations in Canada, India, Nepal, Myanmar, and many African nations; and those affiliated with the [[Church of the Lutheran Brethren]] are especially active doing mission work in Africa and East Asia.\n\nThe Lutheran World Federation-aligned churches do not believe that one church is singularly true in its teachings. According to this belief, Lutheranism is a reform movement rather than a movement into doctrinal correctness. As part of this, in 1999 the LWF and the Roman Catholic Church jointly issued a statement, the ''[[Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification]]'', that stated that the LWF and the Catholics both agreed about certain basics of Justification and lifted certain Catholic [[anathema]]s formerly applying to the LWF member churches.{{Citation needed span|The LCMS has participated in most of the [[Lutheran-Roman Catholic dialogue|official dialogues with the Roman Catholic Church]] since shortly after the [[Second Vatican Council]], though not the one which produced the ''Joint Declaration'' and to which they were not invited.

As of 2019, the Forum is not a full communion organization. Similar in this structure is the [[International Lutheran Council]], where issues of communion are left to the individual denominations. Not all ILC churches have declared church-fellowship with each other. In contrast, mutual church-fellowship is part of the CELC member churches, and unlike in the LWF, this is not contradicted by individual statements from any particular member church body.\n\n[[File:L\u00e6stardianer.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|L\u00e6stadian lay preacher from [[Finnmark]], Norway, 1898|alt=]]\n\n[[Laestadianism|Laestadians]] within certain European state churches maintain close ties to other Laestadians, often called Apostolic Lutherans.

Although [[:s:Augsburg Confession#Article XIV: Of Ecclesiastical Order.|Article XIV]] of the ''Augsburg Confession'' mandates that one must be \"properly called\" to preach or administer the Sacraments, some Lutherans have a broad view of on what constitutes this and thus allow lay preaching or students still studying to be pastors someday to consecrate the Lord's Supper.<ref>For some opinions and historical discussion from someone who takes a broader view, see [https://essays.wls.wels.net/bitstream/handle/123456789/3205/MaaskeCall.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y What is a call?: or, When is a call a call, and who makes it such?] By Alfred H. Maaske</ref> Despite considerable diversity, Lutheran polity trends in a geographically predictable manner in Europe, with episcopal governance to the north and east but blended and consistorial-presbyterian type synodical governance in Germany.\n\n====Scandinavia====\n[[File:\u00c4rkebiskopsvigning.jpg|thumb|left|[[Nathan S\u00f6derblom]] is ordained as archbishop of the Church of Sweden, 1914.

Recently, the Swedish succession was introduced into all of the Porvoo Communion churches, all of which have an episcopal polity. Although the Lutheran churches did not require this or change their doctrine, this was important in order for more strictly high church Anglican individuals to feel comfortable recognizing their sacraments as valid. The occasional ordination of a bishop by a priest was not necessarily considered an invalid ordination in the Middle Ages, so the alleged break in the line of succession in the other Nordic Churches would have been considered a violation of canon law rather than an invalid ordination at the time.  Moreover, there are no consistent records detailing pre-Reformation ordinations prior to the 12th century.<ref>''Das kirchliche Amt in apostolischer Nachfolge''.

However, others are [[S\u00e1mi people#Religion|Orthodox in religion]]. Some Apostolic Lutherans consider their movement as part of an [[Laestadianism#\"Unbroken line of living Christianity\"|unbroken line down from the Apostles]]. In areas where Apostolic Lutherans have their own bishops apart from other Lutheran church organizations, the bishops wield more practical authority than Lutheran clergy typically do. In Russia, Laestadians of Lutheran background cooperate with the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Ingria|Ingrian]] church, but since Laestadianism is an interdenominational movement, some are Eastern Orthodox. Eastern Orthodox Laestadians are known as [[:ru:\u0423\u0448\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0439\u0437\u0435\u0442|Ushkovayzet]] (article is in Russian).<ref>[http://uralistica.com/profiles/blogs/karelskoe-religioznoe Karelian religious movement Uskhovayzet]</ref>\n\n====Eastern Europe and Asian Russia====\n[[File:Spb 06-2012 Nevsky various 06.jpg|thumb|[[Lutheran Church of Saint Peter and Saint Paul]] in St. Petersburg]]\nAlthough historically Pietism had a significant influence on the understanding of the ministry among Lutherans in the Russian Empire,{{efn|See [[:ru:\u0412\u044e\u0441\u0442,_\u042d\u0434\u0443\u0430\u0440\u0434|Edward Wust]] and [[:ru:\u0412\u044e\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0437\u043c|Wustism]] in the Russian Wikipedia for more on this.}} today nearly all Russian and Ukrainian Lutherans are influenced by Eastern Orthodox polity.

This allows for the post-Soviet repatriation of Lutheran church buildings to local congregations on the basis of this historical connection.<ref>[https://logia.org/pdf-back-issues/15-1pdf-lutheranism-in-asia A New \"Old\" Lutheran Church in Asian Russia] by Alexei Streltsov, in Logia, Epiphany 2006: Volume 15, Number 1</ref>\n\n====Germany====\nIn Germany, several dynamics encouraged Lutherans to maintain a different form of polity. First, due to de facto practice during the [[Nuremberg Religious Peace]] the subsequent legal principal of [[Cuius regio, eius religio]] in the 1555 Peace of Augsburg, German states were officially either Catholic or \"Evangelical\" (that is, Lutheran under the ''Augsburg Confession''). In some areas both Catholic and Lutheran churches were permitted to co-exist. Because German speaking Catholic areas were nearby Catholic leaning Christians were able to emigrate and there was less of an issue with Catholics choosing to live as [[crypto-papist]]s in Lutheran areas. Although Reformed leaning Christians were not allowed to have churches, Melancthon wrote ''[[Augsburg Confession Variata]]'' which some used to claim legal protection as \"Evangelical\" churches. Many chose to live as [[crypto-Calvinists]] either with or without the protection offered by the ''Variata'', but this did not make their influence go away, and as a result the Protestant church in Germany as of 2017 was only about ~40% Lutheran, with most of the rest being United Protestant, a combination of Lutheran and Reformed beliefs and practices.<ref name=EKD18>[https://www.ekd.de/ekd_de/ds_doc/Gezaehlt_zahlen_und_fakten_2019.pdf Zahlen und Fakte zum kirchlichen Leben 2019] Evangelische Kirche in Deutschland</ref>\n\n[[File:KirchenordnungSHA.jpg|thumb|left|[[Schw\u00e4bisch Hall]] Church Order, 1543|alt=]]\nIn terms of polity, over 17th and 18th centuries the carefully negotiated and highly prescriptive [[Church Order (Lutheran)|church orders]] of the Reformation era gave way to a joint cooperation between state control and a Reformed-style blend of consistorial and presbyterian type synodical governance. Just as negotiations over the details in the church orders involved the laity, so did the new synodical governance. Synodical governance had already been practiced in the Reformed Netherlands prior to its adoption by Lutherans. During the formation of the modern German state, ideas about the nature of authority and the best design for governments and organizations came from the philosophies [[Political philosophy of Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Elements of the Philosophy of Right|Hegel]], further modifying the polity. When the monarchy and the sovereign governance of the church was ended in 1918, the synods took over the governance of the state churches.\n\n====Western Hemisphere and Australia====\n[[File:Ministerium Hymnal.jpg|thumb|right|The Pennsylvania Ministerium published this 1803 hymnal.<ref>This website has [https://hymnary.org/hymnal/HELC1865 text and midi files] for the 1865 Pennsylvania Ministerium hymnal.</ref>]]\nDuring the period of the emigration, Lutherans took their existing ideas about polity with them across the ocean,<ref>Abdel Ross Wentz (1954), ''A Basic History of Lutheranism in America'', Philadelphia, Pa., p. 41</ref><ref>Clifton E. Olmstead (1960), ''History of Religion in the United States'', Englewood Cliffs, N.J., pp. 6, 140</ref> though with the exception of the early Swedish Lutherans immigrants of the New Sweden colony who accepted the rule of the Anglican bishops and became part of the established church, they now had to fund churches on their own. This increased the congregationalist dynamic in the blended consistorial and presbyterian type synodical governance. The first organized church body of Lutherans in America was the [[Pennsylvania Ministerium]], which used Reformed style synodical governance over the 18th and 19th centuries. Their contribution to the development of polity was that smaller synods could in turn form a larger body, also with synodical governance, but without losing their lower level of governance. As a result, the smaller synods gained unprecedented flexibility to join, leave, merge, or stay separate, all without the hand of the state as had been the case in Europe.\n\nDuring their 19th century persecution, Old Lutheran believers were left in a bind. Resistance to authority was disobedient, but upholding the true doctrine and right practice was also disobedient. Fortunately the doctrine of the [[lesser magistrate]] could be employed, whereby clergy could legitimately resist the state and even leave. illegal free churches were set up in Germany and mass emigration occurred. For decades the new churches were mostly dependent on the free churches to send them new ministerial candidates for ordination. These new church bodies also employed synodical governance, but tended to exclude Hegelianism in their constitutions due to its incompatibility with the doctrine of the lesser magistrates. In contrast to Hegelianism where authority flows in from all levels, Kantianism presents authority flowing only from the top down, hence the need for a lesser magistrate to become the new top magistrate.\n\n[[File:Lighthouse Lutheran Church in Freedom.jpg|thumb|Lighthouse Lutheran Church, an LCMC congregation in [[Freedom, Pennsylvania]]|alt=]]\nOver the 20th and 20th century, some Lutheran bodies have adopted a more congregationalist approach, such as the [[Protest'ant Conference]] and the [[Lutheran Congregations in Mission for Christ]], or LCMC. The LCMC formed due to a church split after the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America signed an [[Called to Common Mission|agreement]] with the Episcopalians to start ordaining all of their new bishops into the Episcopalian Apostolic succession. In other words, this meant that new ELCA bishops, at least at first, would be jointly ordained by Anglican bishops as well as Lutheran bishops so that the more strict Episcopalians would recognize their sacraments as valid. This was offensive to some in the ELCA at the time because of the implications this had on the [[Theology of Martin Luther#Universal priesthood of the baptized|priesthood of all believers]] and the nature of ordination.\n\nToday, some churches allow dual-rostering.<ref>For example, the single Lutheran church on the island of Guam is a member of the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod and the Lutheran Congregations in Mission for Christ. See [http://www.lutheranchurchofguam.org/blog/?page_id=890 Lutheran Church of Guam History]</ref> Situations like this one where a church or church body belongs to multiple larger organizations that do not have ties are termed \"triangular fellowship.\" Another variant are independent Lutheran churches, although for some independent churches the clergy are members of a larger denomination. In other cases, a congregation may belong to a synod, but the pastor may be unaffiliated.<ref>For example, [http://www.trinitynewhaven.com Trinity New Haven, MO] is a member congregation of the Missouri Synod even though their pastor is independent. This congregation was expelled from the Missouri Synod for a while over this, but they challenged it and got back in.</ref> In the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America,<ref>Due to influence from former Missourians joining the ELCA in the [[American Evangelical Lutheran Church]]</ref> the Wisconsin Synod, the Evangelical Lutheran Synod, the Church of the Lutheran Confession, and the Missouri Synod, teachers at parochial schools are considered to be clergy, with the latter defending this before the [[Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church & School v.

Variations on this basic formula describe the magnetic force on a current-carrying wire (sometimes called [[#Force on a current-carrying wire|Laplace force]]), the [[electromotive force]] in a wire loop moving through a magnetic field (an aspect of [[Faraday's law of induction]]), and the force on a charged particle which might be traveling near the [[speed of light]] ([[special relativity|relativistic]] form of the Lorentz force).\n\nHistorians suggest that the law is implicit in a paper by [[James Clerk Maxwell]], published in 1865.<ref name=Huray/> [[Hendrik Lorentz]] arrived in a complete derivation in 1895,<ref name=Dahl/> identifying the contribution of the electric force a few years after [[Oliver Heaviside]] correctly identified the contribution of the magnetic force.<ref name=Nahin/>\n\n==Equation==\n\n===Charged particle===\n\n[[File:Lorentz force particle.svg|200px|thumb|Lorentz force '''F''' on a [[charged particle]] (of charge ''q'') in motion (instantaneous velocity '''v''').

Therefore, explicitly, the Lorentz force can be written as:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{F}\\left(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{\\dot{r}},t,q\\right) = q\\left[\\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{r},t) + \\mathbf{\\dot{r}} \\times \\mathbf{B}(\\mathbf{r},t)\\right]</math>\n\nin which '''r''' is the position vector of the charged particle, ''t'' is time, and the overdot is a time derivative.\n\nA positively charged particle will be accelerated in the ''same'' linear orientation as the '''E''' field, but will curve perpendicularly to both the instantaneous velocity vector '''v''' and the '''B''' field according to the [[right-hand rule]] (in detail, if the fingers of the right hand are extended to point in the direction of '''v''' and are then curled to point in the direction of '''B''', then the extended thumb will point in the direction of '''F''').\n\nThe term ''q'''''E''' is called the '''electric force''', while the term ''q''('''v''' <big>\u00d7</big> '''B''') is called the '''magnetic force'''.<ref name=Griffiths1>See Griffiths, page 204.</ref> According to some definitions, the term \"Lorentz force\" refers specifically to the formula for the magnetic force,<ref name=Griffiths2>For example, see the [http://ilorentz.org/history/lorentz/lorentz.html website of the Lorentz Institute] or Griffiths.</ref> with the ''total'' electromagnetic force (including the electric force) given some other (nonstandard) name. This article will ''not'' follow this nomenclature: In what follows, the term \"Lorentz force\" will refer to the expression for the total force.\n\nThe magnetic force component of the Lorentz force manifests itself as the force that acts on a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field. In that context, it is also called the [[#Force on a current-carrying wire|Laplace force]].\n\nThe Lorentz force is a force exerted by the electromagnetic field on the charged particle, that is, it is the rate at which linear momentum is transferred from the electromagnetic field to the particle. Associated with it is the power which is the rate at which energy is transferred from the electromagnetic field to the particle. That power is\n:<math>\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{F} = q \\, \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{E}</math>.\nNotice that the magnetic field does not contribute to the power because the magnetic force is always perpendicular to the velocity of the particle.\n\n===Continuous charge distribution===\n\n[[File:Lorentz force continuum.svg|200px|thumb|Lorentz force (per unit 3-volume) '''f''' on a continuous [[charge distribution]] ([[charge density]] \u03c1) in motion. The 3-[[current density]] '''J''' corresponds to the motion of the charge element ''dq'' in [[volume element]] ''dV'' and varies throughout the continuum.]]\n\nFor a continuous [[charge distribution]] in motion, the Lorentz force equation becomes:\n\n:<math>\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{F} = \\mathrm{d}q\\left(\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}\\right)\\,\\!</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{F}</math> is the force on a small piece of the charge distribution with charge <math>\\mathrm{d}q</math>. If both sides of this equation are divided by the volume of this small piece of the charge distribution <math>\\mathrm{d}V</math>, the result is:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{f} = \\rho\\left(\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}\\right)\\,\\!</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mathbf{f}</math> is the ''force density'' (force per unit volume) and <math>\\rho</math> is the [[charge density]] (charge per unit volume). Next, the [[current density]] corresponding to the motion of the charge continuum is\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{J} = \\rho \\mathbf{v} \\,\\!</math>\n\nso the continuous analogue to the equation is<ref name=\"Electrodynamics 1999\">{{cite book|last=Griffiths|first=David J.|title=Introduction to electrodynamics|year=1999|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-13-805326-0|edition=3rd|others=reprint. with corr.|url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontoel00grif_0}}</ref>\n\n{{Equation box 1\n|indent =:\n|equation = <math>\\mathbf{f} = \\rho \\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{J} \\times \\mathbf{B}\\,\\!</math>\n|cellpadding= 6\n|border\n|border colour = #0073CF\n|background colour=#F5FFFA}}\n\nThe total force is the [[volume integral]] over the charge distribution:\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{F} = \\iiint \\!

Rather than the amount of charge and its velocity in electric and magnetic fields, this equation relates the [[energy flux]] (flow of ''energy'' per unit time per unit distance) in the fields to the force exerted on a charge distribution. See [[Covariant formulation of classical electromagnetism#Charge continuum|Covariant formulation of classical electromagnetism]] for more details.\n\nThe density of power associated with the Lorentz force in a material medium is\n:<math>\\mathbf{J} \\cdot \\mathbf{E}</math>.\n\nIf we separate the total charge and total current into their free and bound parts, we get that the density of the Lorentz force is\n:<math>\\mathbf{f} = (\\rho_f - \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf P) \\mathbf{E} + (\\mathbf{J}_f + \\nabla\\times\\mathbf{M} + \\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{P}}{\\partial t}) \\times \\mathbf{B}</math>.\n\nwhere: <math>\\rho_f</math> is the density of free charge; <math>\\mathbf{P}</math> is the [[polarization density]]; <math>\\mathbf{J}_f</math> is the density of free current; and <math>\\mathbf{M}</math> is the [[magnetization]] density. In this way, the Lorentz force can explain the torque applied to a permanent magnet by the magnetic field.

(A) No disturbing force (B) With an electric field, E (C) With an independent force, F (e.g. gravity) (D) In an inhomogeneous magnetic field, grad H]]\nIn many cases of practical interest, the motion in a [[magnetic field]] of an [[electric charge|electrically charged]] particle (such as an [[electron]] or [[ion]] in a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]) can be treated as the [[Quantum superposition|superposition]] of a relatively fast circular motion around a point called the '''guiding center''' and a relatively slow '''drift''' of this point. The drift speeds may differ for various species depending on their charge states, masses, or temperatures, possibly resulting in electric currents or chemical separation.\n\n==Significance of the Lorentz force==\n\nWhile the modern Maxwell's equations describe how electrically charged particles and currents or moving charged particles give rise to electric and magnetic fields, the Lorentz force law completes that picture by describing the force acting on a moving point charge ''q'' in the presence of electromagnetic fields.<ref name=Jackson2>See Jackson, page 2. The book lists the four modern Maxwell's equations, and then states, \"Also essential for consideration of charged particle motion is the Lorentz force equation, '''F''' = ''q'' ('''E'''+ '''v <big>\u00d7</big> B'''), which gives the force acting on a point charge ''q'' in the presence of electromagnetic fields.\"</ref><ref name=Griffiths50>See Griffiths, page 326, which states that Maxwell's equations, \"together with the [Lorentz] force law...summarize the entire theoretical content of classical electrodynamics\".</ref> The Lorentz force law describes the effect of '''E''' and '''B''' upon a point charge, but such electromagnetic forces are not the entire picture. Charged particles are possibly coupled to other forces, notably gravity and nuclear forces. Thus, Maxwell's equations do not stand separate from other physical laws, but are coupled to them via the charge and current densities. The response of a point charge to the Lorentz law is one aspect; the generation of '''E''' and '''B''' by currents and charges is another.\n\nIn real materials the Lorentz force is inadequate to describe the collective behavior of charged particles, both in principle and as a matter of computation. The charged particles in a material medium not only respond to the '''E''' and '''B''' fields but also generate these fields. Complex transport equations must be solved to determine the time and spatial response of charges, for example, the [[Boltzmann equation]] or the [[Fokker\u2013Planck equation]] or the [[Navier\u2013Stokes equations]]. For example, see [[magnetohydrodynamics]], [[fluid dynamics]], [[electrohydrodynamics]], [[superconductivity]], [[stellar evolution]]. An entire physical apparatus for dealing with these matters has developed. See for example, [[Green\u2013Kubo relations]] and [[Green's function (many-body theory)]].\n\n==Lorentz force law as the definition of E and B==\n\nIn many textbook treatments of classical electromagnetism, the Lorentz force Law is used as the ''definition'' of the electric and magnetic fields '''E''' and '''B'''.<ref name=Jackson20>See, for example, Jackson, pp. 777\u20138.</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Gravitation|author1=J.A.

The fields are defined everywhere in space and time with respect to what force a test charge would receive regardless of whether a charge is present to experience the force.\n\nAs a definition of '''E''' and '''B''', the Lorentz force is only a definition in principle because a real particle (as opposed to the hypothetical \"test charge\" of infinitesimally-small mass and charge) would generate its own finite '''E''' and '''B''' fields, which would alter the electromagnetic force that it experiences. In addition, if the charge experiences acceleration, as if forced into a curved trajectory by some external agency, it emits radiation that causes braking of its motion. See for example [[Bremsstrahlung]] and [[synchrotron light]]. These effects occur through both a direct effect (called the [[Abraham\u2013Lorentz force|radiation reaction force]]) and indirectly (by affecting the motion of nearby charges and currents). Moreover, net force must include [[gravity]], [[Electroweak interaction|electroweak]], and any other forces aside from electromagnetic force.\n\n==Force on a current-carrying wire==\n[[File:Regla mano derecha Laplace.svg|right|thumb|250px|Right-hand rule for a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field ''B'']]\nWhen a wire carrying an electric current is placed in a magnetic field, each of the moving charges, which comprise the current, experiences the Lorentz force, and together they can create a macroscopic force on the wire (sometimes called the '''Laplace force'''). By combining the Lorentz force law above with the definition of electric current, the following equation results, in the case of a straight, stationary wire:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.physicsexperiment.co.uk/content/bil.html|title=Physics Experiments|website=www.physicsexperiment.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-08-14}}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{F} = I \\boldsymbol{\\ell} \\times \\mathbf{B}</math>\n\nwhere '''\u2113''' is a vector whose magnitude is the length of wire, and whose direction is along the wire, aligned with the direction of [[conventional current]] charge flow ''I''.\n\nIf the wire is not straight but curved, the force on it can be computed by applying this formula to each [[infinitesimal]] segment of wire ''d'''''\u2113''', then adding up all these forces by [[integration (calculus)|integration]]. Formally, the net force on a stationary, rigid wire carrying a steady current ''I'' is\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{F} = I\\int \\mathrm{d}\\boldsymbol{\\ell}\\times \\mathbf{B}</math>\n\nThis is the net force. In addition, there will usually be [[torque]], plus other effects if the wire is not perfectly rigid.\n\nOne application of this is [[Amp\u00e8re's force law]], which describes how two current-carrying wires can attract or repel each other, since each experiences a Lorentz force from the other's magnetic field. For more information, see the article: [[Amp\u00e8re's force law]].\n\n==EMF==\n\nThe magnetic force ({{nowrap|''q'''''v''' \u00d7 '''B'''}}) component of the Lorentz force is responsible for ''motional'' [[electromotive force]] (or ''motional EMF''), the phenomenon underlying many electrical generators. When a conductor is moved through a magnetic field, the magnetic field exerts opposite forces on electrons and nuclei in the wire, and this creates the EMF. The term \"motional EMF\" is applied to this phenomenon, since the EMF is due to the ''motion'' of the wire.\n\nIn other electrical generators, the magnets move, while the conductors do not. In this case, the EMF is due to the electric force (''q'''''E''') term in the Lorentz Force equation. The electric field in question is created by the changing magnetic field, resulting in an ''induced'' EMF, as described by the [[Electromagnetic induction#Maxwell\u2013Faraday equation|Maxwell\u2013Faraday equation]] (one of the four modern [[Maxwell's equations]]).<ref name=Griffiths302>See Griffiths, pages 301\u20133.</ref>\n\nBoth of these EMFs, despite their apparently distinct origins, are described by the same equation, namely, the EMF is the rate of change of [[magnetic flux]] through the wire. (This is Faraday's law of induction, see [[Lorentz force#Lorentz force and Faraday.27s law of induction|below]].) Einstein's [[special theory of relativity]] was partially motivated by the desire to better understand this link between the two effects.<ref name=Griffiths302/> In fact, the electric and magnetic fields are different facets of the same electromagnetic field, and in moving from one inertial frame to another, the [[solenoidal vector field]] portion of the ''E''-field can change in whole or in part to a ''B''-field or ''vice versa''.<ref name=Chow>\n{{cite book\n|author=Tai L.

However, there are cases where Faraday's law is either inadequate or difficult to use, and application of the underlying Lorentz force law is necessary. See [[Faraday paradox#Inapplicability of Faraday's law|inapplicability of Faraday's law]].\n\nIf the magnetic field is fixed in time and the conducting loop moves through the field, the magnetic flux \u03a6<sub>''B''</sub> linking the loop can change in several ways. For example, if the '''B'''-field varies with position, and the loop moves to a location with different '''B'''-field, \u03a6<sub>''B''</sub> will change.

This article will ''not'' follow this nomenclature: In what follows, the term \"Lorentz force\" will refer to the expression for the total force.\n\nThe magnetic force component of the Lorentz force manifests itself as the force that acts on a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field. In that context, it is also called the [[#Force on a current-carrying wire|Laplace force]].\n\nThe Lorentz force is a force exerted by the electromagnetic field on the charged particle, that is, it is the rate at which linear momentum is transferred from the electromagnetic field to the particle.

That power is\n:<math>\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{F} = q \\, \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{E}</math>.\nNotice that the magnetic field does not contribute to the power because the magnetic force is always perpendicular to the velocity of the particle.\n\n===Continuous charge distribution===\n\n[[File:Lorentz force continuum.svg|200px|thumb|Lorentz force (per unit 3-volume) '''f''' on a continuous [[charge distribution]] ([[charge density]] \u03c1) in motion.

The drift speeds may differ for various species depending on their charge states, masses, or temperatures, possibly resulting in electric currents or chemical separation.\n\n==Significance of the Lorentz force==\n\nWhile the modern Maxwell's equations describe how electrically charged particles and currents or moving charged particles give rise to electric and magnetic fields, the Lorentz force law completes that picture by describing the force acting on a moving point charge ''q'' in the presence of electromagnetic fields.<ref name=Jackson2>See Jackson, page 2. The book lists the four modern Maxwell's equations, and then states, \"Also essential for consideration of charged particle motion is the Lorentz force equation, '''F''' = ''q'' ('''E'''+ '''v <big>\u00d7</big> B'''), which gives the force acting on a point charge ''q'' in the presence of electromagnetic fields.\"</ref><ref name=Griffiths50>See Griffiths, page 326, which states that Maxwell's equations, \"together with the [Lorentz] force law...summarize the entire theoretical content of classical electrodynamics\".</ref> The Lorentz force law describes the effect of '''E''' and '''B''' upon a point charge, but such electromagnetic forces are not the entire picture. Charged particles are possibly coupled to other forces, notably gravity and nuclear forces. Thus, Maxwell's equations do not stand separate from other physical laws, but are coupled to them via the charge and current densities. The response of a point charge to the Lorentz law is one aspect; the generation of '''E''' and '''B''' by currents and charges is another.\n\nIn real materials the Lorentz force is inadequate to describe the collective behavior of charged particles, both in principle and as a matter of computation. The charged particles in a material medium not only respond to the '''E''' and '''B''' fields but also generate these fields. Complex transport equations must be solved to determine the time and spatial response of charges, for example, the [[Boltzmann equation]] or the [[Fokker\u2013Planck equation]] or the [[Navier\u2013Stokes equations]]. For example, see [[magnetohydrodynamics]], [[fluid dynamics]], [[electrohydrodynamics]], [[superconductivity]], [[stellar evolution]]. An entire physical apparatus for dealing with these matters has developed. See for example, [[Green\u2013Kubo relations]] and [[Green's function (many-body theory)]].\n\n==Lorentz force law as the definition of E and B==\n\nIn many textbook treatments of classical electromagnetism, the Lorentz force Law is used as the ''definition'' of the electric and magnetic fields '''E''' and '''B'''.<ref name=Jackson20>See, for example, Jackson, pp. 777\u20138.</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Gravitation|author1=J.A.

The fields are defined everywhere in space and time with respect to what force a test charge would receive regardless of whether a charge is present to experience the force.\n\nAs a definition of '''E''' and '''B''', the Lorentz force is only a definition in principle because a real particle (as opposed to the hypothetical \"test charge\" of infinitesimally-small mass and charge) would generate its own finite '''E''' and '''B''' fields, which would alter the electromagnetic force that it experiences. In addition, if the charge experiences acceleration, as if forced into a curved trajectory by some external agency, it emits radiation that causes braking of its motion. See for example [[Bremsstrahlung]] and [[synchrotron light]]. These effects occur through both a direct effect (called the [[Abraham\u2013Lorentz force|radiation reaction force]]) and indirectly (by affecting the motion of nearby charges and currents). Moreover, net force must include [[gravity]], [[Electroweak interaction|electroweak]], and any other forces aside from electromagnetic force.\n\n==Force on a current-carrying wire==\n[[File:Regla mano derecha Laplace.svg|right|thumb|250px|Right-hand rule for a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field ''B'']]\nWhen a wire carrying an electric current is placed in a magnetic field, each of the moving charges, which comprise the current, experiences the Lorentz force, and together they can create a macroscopic force on the wire (sometimes called the '''Laplace force'''). By combining the Lorentz force law above with the definition of electric current, the following equation results, in the case of a straight, stationary wire:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.physicsexperiment.co.uk/content/bil.html|title=Physics Experiments|website=www.physicsexperiment.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-08-14}}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{F} = I \\boldsymbol{\\ell} \\times \\mathbf{B}</math>\n\nwhere '''\u2113''' is a vector whose magnitude is the length of wire, and whose direction is along the wire, aligned with the direction of [[conventional current]] charge flow ''I''.\n\nIf the wire is not straight but curved, the force on it can be computed by applying this formula to each [[infinitesimal]] segment of wire ''d'''''\u2113''', then adding up all these forces by [[integration (calculus)|integration]]. Formally, the net force on a stationary, rigid wire carrying a steady current ''I'' is\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{F} = I\\int \\mathrm{d}\\boldsymbol{\\ell}\\times \\mathbf{B}</math>\n\nThis is the net force. In addition, there will usually be [[torque]], plus other effects if the wire is not perfectly rigid.\n\nOne application of this is [[Amp\u00e8re's force law]], which describes how two current-carrying wires can attract or repel each other, since each experiences a Lorentz force from the other's magnetic field. For more information, see the article: [[Amp\u00e8re's force law]].\n\n==EMF==\n\nThe magnetic force ({{nowrap|''q'''''v''' \u00d7 '''B'''}}) component of the Lorentz force is responsible for ''motional'' [[electromotive force]] (or ''motional EMF''), the phenomenon underlying many electrical generators. When a conductor is moved through a magnetic field, the magnetic field exerts opposite forces on electrons and nuclei in the wire, and this creates the EMF. The term \"motional EMF\" is applied to this phenomenon, since the EMF is due to the ''motion'' of the wire.\n\nIn other electrical generators, the magnets move, while the conductors do not. In this case, the EMF is due to the electric force (''q'''''E''') term in the Lorentz Force equation. The electric field in question is created by the changing magnetic field, resulting in an ''induced'' EMF, as described by the [[Electromagnetic induction#Maxwell\u2013Faraday equation|Maxwell\u2013Faraday equation]] (one of the four modern [[Maxwell's equations]]).<ref name=Griffiths302>See Griffiths, pages 301\u20133.</ref>\n\nBoth of these EMFs, despite their apparently distinct origins, are described by the same equation, namely, the EMF is the rate of change of [[magnetic flux]] through the wire.

However, there are cases where Faraday's law is either inadequate or difficult to use, and application of the underlying Lorentz force law is necessary. See [[Faraday paradox#Inapplicability of Faraday's law|inapplicability of Faraday's law]].\n\nIf the magnetic field is fixed in time and the conducting loop moves through the field, the magnetic flux \u03a6<sub>''B''</sub> linking the loop can change in several ways. For example, if the '''B'''-field varies with position, and the loop moves to a location with different '''B'''-field, \u03a6<sub>''B''</sub> will change. Alternatively, if the loop changes orientation with respect to the '''B'''-field, the {{nowrap|'''B''' &sdot; d'''A'''}} differential element will change because of the different angle between '''B''' and d'''A''', also changing \u03a6<sub>''B''</sub>. As a third example, if a portion of the circuit is swept through a uniform, time-independent '''B'''-field, and another portion of the circuit is held stationary, the flux linking the entire closed circuit can change due to the shift in relative position of the circuit's component parts with time (surface \u2202\u03a3(''t'') time-dependent). In all three cases, Faraday's law of induction then predicts the EMF generated by the change in \u03a6<sub>''B''</sub>.\n\nNote that the Maxwell Faraday's equation implies that the Electric Field '''E''' is non conservative when the Magnetic Field '''B''' varies in time, and is not expressible as the gradient of a [[scalar field]], and not subject to the [[gradient theorem]] since its rotational is not zero.<ref name=\"Landau\"/><ref>{{cite book\n|author=M N O Sadiku\n|title=Elements of electromagnetics\n|year= 2007\n|page =391\n|edition=Fourth\n|publisher=Oxford University Press\n|location=NY/Oxford\n|isbn=978-0-19-530048-2\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w2ITHQAACAAJ&dq=ISBN0-19-530048-3}}</ref>\n\n==Lorentz force in terms of potentials==\n\n{{see also|Mathematical descriptions of the electromagnetic field|Maxwell's equations|Helmholtz decomposition}}\n\nThe '''E''' and '''B''' fields can be replaced by the [[magnetic vector potential]] '''A''' and ([[Scalar (mathematics)|scalar]]) [[electrostatic potential]] ''\u03d5''  by\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{E} = - \\nabla \\phi - \\frac { \\partial \\mathbf{A} } { \\partial t }</math>\n:<math>\\mathbf{B} = \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A}</math>\n\nwhere \u2207 is the gradient, \u2207\u22c5 is the divergence, \u2207\u00d7 is the [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]].\n\nThe force becomes\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{F} = q\\left[-\\nabla \\phi- \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{A}}{\\partial t}+\\mathbf{v}\\times(\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{A})\\right].</math>\n\nUsing an [[Triple product#Vector triple product|identity for the triple product]] this can be rewritten as,\n\n<math>\\mathbf{F} = q\\left[-\\nabla \\phi- \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{A}}{\\partial t}+\\nabla\\left(\\mathbf{v}\\cdot \\mathbf{A} \\right)-\\left(\\mathbf{v}\\cdot \\nabla\\right)\\mathbf{A}\\right],</math>\n\n(Notice that the coordinates and the velocity components should be treated as independent variables, so the del operator acts only on <math>\\mathbf{A}</math>, not on <math>\\mathbf{v}</math>; thus, there is no need of using [[Vector calculus identities#Special notations|Feynman's subscript notation]] in the equation above).

Upon a space time split like one can obtain the velocity, and fields as above yielding the usual expression.\n\n===Lorentz force in general relativity===\nIn the [[general theory of relativity]] the equation of motion for a particle with mass <math>m</math> and charge <math>e</math>, moving in a space with metric tensor <math>g_{ab}</math> and electromagnetic field <math>F_{ab}</math>, is given as\n:<math>\nm\\frac{du_c}{ds}-m\\frac{1}{2}g_{ab,c}u^au^b=eF_{cb}u^b \\;,\n</math>\nwhere <math>u^a= dx^a/ds</math> (<math>dx^a</math> is taken along the trajectory), <math>g_{ab,c}= \\partial g_{ab}/\\partial x^c</math>, and <math>ds^2=g_{ab}dx^adx^b</math>.\n\nThe equation can also be written as\n:<math>\nm\\frac{du_c}{ds}-m\\Gamma_{abc}u^au^b=eF_{cb}u^b \\;,\n</math>\nwhere <math>\\Gamma_{abc}</math> is the [[Levi-Civita connection#Christoffel symbols|Christoffel symbol]] (of the torsion-free metric connection in general relativity), or as\n:<math>\nm\\frac{Du_c}{ds}=eF_{cb}u^b \\;,\n</math>\nwhere <math>D</math> is the [[covariant differential]] in general relativity (metric, torsion-free).\n\n==Applications==\nThe Lorentz force occurs in many devices, including:\n*[[Cyclotron]]s and other circular path [[particle accelerator]]s\n*[[Mass spectrometer]]s\n*Velocity Filters\n*[[Magnetron]]s\n*[[Lorentz force velocimetry]]\n\nIn its manifestation as the Laplace force on an electric current in a conductor, this force occurs in many devices including:\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Electric motor]]s\n*[[Railgun]]s\n*[[Linear motor]]s\n*[[Loudspeaker]]s\n*[[Magnetoplasmadynamic thruster]]s\n*[[Electrical generator]]s\n*[[Homopolar generator]]s\n*[[Linear alternator]]s\n{{colend}}\n\n==See also==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Hall effect]]\n* [[Electromagnetism]]\n* [[Gravitomagnetism]]\n* [[Amp\u00e8re's force law]]\n* [[Hendrik Lorentz]]\n* [[Maxwell's equations]]\n* [[Formulation of Maxwell's equations in special relativity]]\n* [[Moving magnet and conductor problem]]\n* [[Abraham\u2013Lorentz force]]\n* [[Larmor formula]]\n* [[Cyclotron radiation]]\n* [[Magnetoresistance]]\n* [[Scalar potential]]\n* [[Helmholtz decomposition]]\n* [[Guiding center]]\n* [[Field line]]\n* [[Coulomb's law]]\n* [[Electromagnetic buoyancy]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n\nThe numbered references refer in part to the list immediately below.\n\n*{{Cite book |first1 = Richard Phillips |last1 = Feynman |author-link = Richard Feynman |first2 = Robert B. |last2 = Leighton  |first3 = Matthew L. |last3 = Sands |title = The Feynman lectures on physics (3 vol.) |publisher = Pearson / Addison-Wesley | year= 2006 |isbn = 0-8053-9047-2 }}: volume 2.\n*{{Cite book |first = David J. |last = Griffiths |title = Introduction to electrodynamics |edition = 3rd |place = Upper Saddle River, [NJ.] |publisher = Prentice-Hall |year = 1999 |isbn = 0-13-805326-X |url = https://archive.org/details/introductiontoel00grif_0 }}\n*{{Cite book |first = John David |last = Jackson  |title = Classical electrodynamics |edition = 3rd\n |location = New York, [NY.] |publisher = Wiley | year = 1999 |isbn = 0-471-30932-X }}\n\n*{{Cite book |first1 = Raymond A. |last1 = Serway |first2 = John W., Jr. |last2 = Jewett |title = Physics for scientists and engineers, with modern physics |place = Belmont, [CA.]  |publisher = Thomson Brooks/Cole |year = 2004 |isbn = 0-534-40846-X }}\n*{{Cite book |first = Mark A. |last = Srednicki |title= Quantum field theory |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5OepxIG42B4C&pg=PA315&dq=isbn=9780521864497 |place = Cambridge, [England] ; New York [NY.] |publisher = Cambridge University Press | year=2007  |isbn = 978-0-521-86449-7 }}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons|Lorentz force}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20150713153934/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxMMqNrm598 Lorentz force (demonstration)]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090226225302/http://www.nadn.navy.mil/Users/physics/tank/Public/FaradaysLaw.pdf Faraday's law: Tankersley and Mosca]\n*[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/HBASE/hframe.html Notes from Physics and Astronomy HyperPhysics at Georgia State University]; see also [http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/HBASE/hframe.html home page]\n* [http://chair.pa.msu.edu/applets/Lorentz/a.htm Interactive Java applet on the magnetic deflection of a particle beam in a homogeneous magnetic field] by Wolfgang Bauer\n* [http://ilorentz.org/history/wallformulas/images/pages/page_5.html The Lorentz force formula on a wall directly opposite Lorentz's home in downtown Leiden]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Concepts in physics]]\n[[Category:Electromagnetism]]\n[[Category:Maxwell's equations]]\n[[Category:Hendrik Lorentz]]\n", "name_user": "Physicist137", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eLorentz force and analytical mechanics", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_force"}
