It was released on November 22, 2010, by [[Def Jam Recordings]] and [[Roc-A-Fella Records]]. It follows a period of public and legal controversy for West, who retreated to a self-imposed exile in Hawaii in 2009 and recorded in a communal environment involving numerous contributing musicians and producers. Recorded mainly at Honolulu's Avex Recording Studio, additional sessions took place at Glenwood Place Studios in Burbank, California, and at [[Electric Lady Studios]] and Platinum Sound Recording Studios in New York City.\n\nThe album was produced primarily by West, along with a variety of high-profile producers such as [[Mike Dean (record producer)|Mike Dean]], [[No I.D.]], [[Jeff Bhasker]], [[RZA]], [[Symbolyc One|S1]], [[Bink (record producer)|Bink]], and [[DJ Frank E]]. Music journalists have noted the album features a [[Maximalism|maximalist]] aesthetic and opulent production quality with elements of West's previous works, including [[soul music|soul]], [[baroque pop|baroque]], [[electro (music)|electro]], and symphonic styles, as well as [[progressive rock]] influences. Thematically, ''My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy'' explores West's status as a celebrity, [[Media culture|consumer culture]], [[Race (human categorization)|race]], and the idealism of the [[American Dream]]. Guest vocalists on the album include [[Bon Iver]], [[Jay-Z]], [[Pusha T]], [[Rick Ross]], [[Kid Cudi]], [[Nicki Minaj]], [[John Legend]], and [[Raekwon]], as well as uncredited additional vocals by [[Alicia Keys]], [[Drake (musician)|Drake]], [[Elly Jackson]], [[Elton John]], [[Fergie (singer)|Fergie]] and [[The-Dream]].\n\nPrior to the album's release, West debuted \"[[Runaway (Kanye West song)|Runaway]]\" in live performance at the [[2010 MTV Video Music Awards]]. To help market the album, West released free songs through his [[GOOD Fridays]] weekly free music release series and four singles: \"[[Power (Kanye West song)|Power]]\", \"Runaway\", \"[[Monster (Kanye West song)|Monster]]\" and \"[[All of the Lights]]\", which were all top 40 hits on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. West also released a [[Musical film|musical]] [[short film]], ''[[Runaway (2010 film)|Runaway]]'' (2010), set to music from the album. In its first week of release, ''My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy'' debuted at number one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and sold 496,000 copies, eventually reaching two million for a [[RIAA certification|double platinum]] certification by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). Following the release, West performed headlining sets at several large festivals, including [[South by Southwest|SXSW]] 2011, [[Lollapalooza]], ''[[Austin City Limits]]'', and [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella 2011]]. West also performed at [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]].\n\n''My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy'' was an immediate and widespread critical success, and was named the best album of 2010 in many publications' year-end lists, including the annual [[Pazz & Jop]] poll of American critics nationwide. The album also won [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Album|Best Rap Album]] at the [[54th Annual Grammy Awards|54th Grammy Awards]] but was not nominated for [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]], which was viewed as a \"snub\" by several media outlets.

In the years following its release, the album has widely been considered West's best album, and has since been ranked in several professionally curated lists as the best album of the 2010s and one of the greatest albums of all time by publications including ''[[NME]]'' and ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.

It was released on November 22, 2010, by [[Def Jam Recordings]] and [[Roc-A-Fella Records]]. It follows a period of public and legal controversy for West, who retreated to a self-imposed exile in Hawaii in 2009 and recorded in a communal environment involving numerous contributing musicians and producers. Recorded mainly at Honolulu's Avex Recording Studio, additional sessions took place at Glenwood Place Studios in Burbank, California, and at [[Electric Lady Studios]] and Platinum Sound Recording Studios in New York City.\n\nThe album was produced primarily by West, along with a variety of high-profile producers such as [[Mike Dean (record producer)|Mike Dean]], [[No I.D.]], [[Jeff Bhasker]], [[RZA]], [[Symbolyc One|S1]], [[Bink (record producer)|Bink]], and [[DJ Frank E]]. Music journalists have noted the album features a [[Maximalism|maximalist]] aesthetic and opulent production quality with elements of West's previous works, including [[soul music|soul]], [[baroque pop|baroque]], [[electro (music)|electro]], and symphonic styles, as well as [[progressive rock]] influences. Thematically, ''My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy'' explores West's status as a celebrity, [[Media culture|consumer culture]], [[Race (human categorization)|race]], and the idealism of the [[American Dream]]. Guest vocalists on the album include [[Bon Iver]], [[Jay-Z]], [[Pusha T]], [[Rick Ross]], [[Kid Cudi]], [[Nicki Minaj]], [[John Legend]], and [[Raekwon]], as well as uncredited additional vocals by [[Alicia Keys]], [[Drake (rapper)|Drake]], [[Elly Jackson]], [[Elton John]], [[Fergie (singer)|Fergie]] and [[The-Dream]].\n\nPrior to the album's release, West debuted \"[[Runaway (Kanye West song)|Runaway]]\" in live performance at the [[2010 MTV Video Music Awards]]. To help market the album, West released free songs through his [[GOOD Fridays]] weekly free music release series and four singles: \"[[Power (Kanye West song)|Power]]\", \"Runaway\", \"[[Monster (Kanye West song)|Monster]]\" and \"[[All of the Lights]]\", which were all top 40 hits on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. West also released a [[Musical film|musical]] [[short film]], ''[[Runaway (2010 film)|Runaway]]'' (2010), set to music from the album. In its first week of release, ''My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy'' debuted at number one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and sold 496,000 copies, eventually reaching two million for a [[RIAA certification|double platinum]] certification by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). Following the release, West performed headlining sets at several large festivals, including [[South by Southwest|SXSW]] 2011, [[Lollapalooza]], ''[[Austin City Limits]]'', and [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella 2011]]. West also performed at [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]].\n\n''My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy'' was an immediate and widespread critical success, and was named the best album of 2010 in many publications' year-end lists, including the annual [[Pazz & Jop]] poll of American critics nationwide. The album also won [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Album|Best Rap Album]] at the [[54th Annual Grammy Awards|54th Grammy Awards]] but was not nominated for [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]], which was viewed as a \"snub\" by several media outlets. The album's [[Hit song|hit single]] \"All of the Lights\" won [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Song|Best Rap Song]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Performance|Best Rap/Sung Collaboration]]. In the years following its release, the album has widely been considered West's best album, and has since been ranked in several professionally curated lists as the best album of the 2010s and one of the greatest albums of all time by publications including ''[[NME]]'' and ''[[Rolling Stone]]''. [[George Condo]]'s accompanying artwork \u2014 illustrating West straddled by an armless winged female (a [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]]) \u2014 has been ranked among the greatest album covers.\n\n== Background ==\nThe album was conceived during West's self-imposed exile in [[Oahu|Oahu, Hawaii]], following a period of legal and public image controversy.<ref name=\"Bever\">Callahan-Bever, Noah (November 2010).
