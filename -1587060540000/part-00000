The conspiracy - motivated by the Christian daimy\u014d [[Arima Harunobu]]'s desire to retake [[Arima clan|Arima]] lands in [[Hizen]] that were lost in the [[Sengoku period|Sengoku]] wars - did much to shake the confidence that the Tokugawa regime placed on its Christian subjects, and was attributed as one of the reasons the Tokugawa eventually took an anti-Christian stance, which culminated in the persecution of Christians throughout the country.\n\n==Background==\nIn 1543, during the wars of the [[Sengoku period]], the Portuguese made landing on Japan for the first time, and soon spread Christianity throughout Japan from [[Kyushu]]. Regional ''[[daimy\u014d]]'', or feudal lords, were eager to trade with the Portuguese for their European [[arquebus]], while the Portuguese saw the Japanese as potential converts to the Christian religion, preferring to trade with those who converted. Trade and religion thus tied, many ''daimyo'' became Christian, such that at the eve of unification of Japan by [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] in 1600, as many as 14 ''daimyo'' at the time were baptised.{{sfn|Costa|2003|p=56}} Even when some of those Christian ''daimyo'' supported Ieyasu at the decisive [[Battle of Sekigahara]], many other Christian ''daimyo'' rallied around the heir of [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]. In any case, the question remained for the unifier of Japan where the Christian lords' loyalties ultimately lay.\n\n[[Arima Harunobu]], the daimyo of [[Shimabara Domain|Hinoe Domain]], became one of the most important supporters of the Church in post-Sekigahara Japan as Tokugawa Ieyasu became ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'' and purged his enemies, like the influential Christian lord [[Konishi Yukinaga]]. In the first decade of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], Arima Harunobu was able to keep his fief and was given the right to send [[red seal ships]] to trade overseas. In one of these voyages in 1608, the crew of a red seal ship belonging to Harunobu became involved in a deadly quarrel in [[Portuguese Macau]] after coming back from Cambodia to fetch a cargo of [[agarwood]] for Ieyasu, resulting in 50 Arima samurai being killed under the orders of the [[Captain-major]] [[Andr\u00e9 Pessoa]].{{sfn|Boxer|1948|p=53}} The same captain-major came to Nagasaki on the ''[[Nossa Senhora da Gra\u00e7a incident|Nossa Senhora da Gra\u00e7a]]'' to trade in 1609, and Arima Harunobu took this opportunity to seek permission from Tokugawa Ieyasu to seek revenge for his dead men. Ieyasu acceded - although the Portuguese controlled much of the [[Nanban trade]], Ieyasu sought to decouple the close relationship between that trade and Christianity. Arima Harunobu thereupon took a flotilla of 1,200 men to attack Pessoa in Nagasaki, and after a three-day engagement, the ''Nossa Senhora da Gra\u00e7a'' sank in an explosion bringing Pessoa down with it on January 6, 1610. However, this victory for Harunobu soon led to his downfall.\n\n==Intrigues==\nFor Arima's part in sinking the ''Nossa Senhora da Gra\u00e7a'', Ieyasu not only rewarded Arima Harunobu with a prized sword, but also presented his granddaughter Kunihime (\u56fd\u59eb) as wife for Harunobu's son [[Arima Naozumi|Naozumi]]. This proved to be problematic for the Arima, as Naozumi had followed Christianity like his father and had married a Christian girl. Naozumi eventually repudiated his legitimate wife in favour of Kunihime, showing that, rather than standing by his faith and family, Naozumi opted to not risk offending Ieyasu.{{sfn|Pacheco|1971|p=78}}\n\nHarunobu apparently felt that his efforts during the ''Nossa Senhora da Gra\u00e7a'' incident warranted further rewards \u2014 namely the return of the territories [[Isahaya]] and K\u014djiro (\u795e\u4ee3) in [[Hizen Province]] that the Arima lost during the [[Sengoku period]].{{sfn|Ribeiro|2006|p=59}} To this end, Harunobu bribed Okamoto Daihachi (\u5ca1\u672c\u5927\u516b, [[baptismal name]] Paulo), a Christian aide to the ''[[r\u014dj\u016b]]'' [[Honda Masazumi]], who advised Ieyasu on affairs concerning the redistribution of fiefs. However, Okamoto took the money and did not follow through; instead, he strung Harunobu on by forging documents promising to reward Arima with the territories, then claiming that the reward had been revoked due to the interference of the [[Nagasaki bugyo|Governor of Nagasaki]] [[Hasegawa Fujihiro]].{{sfn|Murdoch|Yamagata|1903|p=488}} Harunobu, after seeking further assistance from a Jesuit priest on this matter to no avail,{{sfn|Boxer|1951|p=315}} brought the issue directly to Ieyasu in 1612, bringing Okamoto's scam to light.{{sfn|Murdoch|Yamagata|1903|p=488}} At this juncture, Naozumi turned against his father and told Ieyasu of Harunobu's underhanded dealings with Okamoto.{{sfn|Pacheco|1971|p=79}}{{sfn|Boxer|1951|p=315}}\n\nThat the investiture of fiefs, a matter that defines the feudal relations of the Tokugawa shogunate, could be bought and sold was deeply troubling to Tokugawa Ieyasu.{{sfn|Elisonas|1991|p=366}} He sentenced Okamoto Daihachi to [[death by burning]] for forging sh\u014dgunal documents, but not before Daihachi had a chance to reveal that Arima Harunobu had conspired to kill Hasegawa Fujihiro. As the important port city of Nagasaki was governed directly by a shogunate-appointed officer (rather than through a daimy\u014d), this conspiracy was seen as an affront to Tokugawa rule.{{sfn|Elisonas|1991|p=3367}} For this and his bribery, Harunobu was exiled to [[Kai Province]] in late 1612, and was ordered to commit suicide by ''[[seppuku]]'' the next year. However, Harunobu refused to kill himself on grounds of his faith, and instead had his head cut off.{{sfn|Pacheco|1971|p=78}} Naozumi was allowed to inherit his father's fief for his part in denouncing Harunobu.{{sfn|Boxer|1951|p=315}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe fact that the perpetrators of this episode of bribery, conspiracy, forgery, and attempted murder were both Christians was not lost on Ieyasu. The retired sh\u014dgun was further incensed to hear that Christian followers had gathered at Okamoto's execution to offer prayers and sing hymns, cementing in his mind that the creed encouraged insubordination against the shogunate.{{sfn|Murdoch|Yamagata|1903|p=498}} Ieyasu later referenced this incident along with other executions of Christian criminals in 1614:\n\n{{quote|If they see a condemned fellow, they run to him with joy, bow to him, and do him reverence. This they say is the essence of their belief. If this is not an evil law, what is it? They truly are the enemies of the Gods and of Buddha.{{sfn|Boxer|1951|p=318}}}}\n\nIn the same year as the Daihachi incident was uncovered, Ieyasu evicted the Christian servants of his household and forbade his vassals from following Christianity or risk having their revenues withheld. On January 27, 1614, the prohibition was extended to everyone regardless of class or origin, including all missionaries without exception.{{sfn|Boxer|1951|p=317}} This order was unevenly followed by Ieyasu's vassals, as domains that were predominantly Christian or sufficiently far from the central did not interfere with their Christian subjects up to 1623.{{sfn|Murdoch|Yamagata|1903|p=498}} However, in [[Shimabara Domain]] (formerly the Hinoe Domain), Arima Naozumi [[apostatized]] and pursued a campaign of persecution of Christians, killing even his two half-brothers, aged 8 and 6.{{sfn|Boxer|1951|p=315}} He was transferred to [[Nobeoka, Miyazaki|Nobeoka]] in [[Hy\u016bga Province]] in mid-1614, leaving behind a restive Christian population that would instigate the [[Shimabara Rebellion]].{{sfn|Elisonas|1991|p=367}}\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*{{cite book|last = Boxer| first = C.

Thus the cows were born. Similarly, everything that exists in pairs, was created.

The universe became an expanse of water, and in that Vishnu was born in the golden egg. He created Brahma with four faces. Brahma then created the devas, asuras, pitris and manushas. He also created the rakshasas, yakshas, and gandharvas. Other creatures came from the various parts of his body (e.g. snakes from his hair, sheep from his chest, goats from his mouth, cows from his stomach, others from his feet). His body hair became herbs. The four varnas came from his body parts and the four Vedas from his mouths. He created several sons from his mind: Daksha, Daksha's wife, Manu Svaymbhuva, his wife Shatarupta and the rishi Kashypa.

A variety of myths exist regarding the specifics of the process, but in general the Hindu view of the cosmos is as eternal and cyclic. The later puranic view also asserts that the universe is created, destroyed, and re-created in an eternally repetitive series of cycles. In Hindu cosmology, a universe endures for about 4,320,000,000 years (one [[day of Brahma]], the creator or ''kalpa'')<ref>A survey of Hinduism, [[Klaus K. Klostermaier]], 2007, pp. 495-496</ref> and is then destroyed by fire or water elements. At this point, Brahma rests for one night, just as long as the day.

His body hair became herbs. The four varnas came from his body parts and the four Vedas from his mouths.

The later puranic view also asserts that the universe is created, destroyed, and re-created in an eternally repetitive series of cycles.

For his new decade debut, Wayne takes a 'throw everything at the wall and see what sticks' approach, only hitting the target about half the time. Wayne is at his best when he dives into a beat and shows off his technical skill. He still has endless punchlines to punctuate his effortless flow. He still has clear vision and awareness of his place in the hip-hop game. However, Wayne is not a great editor, and thus listening to ''Funeral'' can become exhausting about halfway through. While listeners may be fatigued, however, Wayne is far from it. ''Funeral'' isn't an ending point or a period at the end of a successful career. It's an ellipsis, a thought to be continued next time Weezy graces the studio\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2020/02/album-review-lil-wayne-funeral/|title=Album Review: Lil Wayne's Funeral Celebrates a Life That's Far from Over|date=February 3, 2020|website=Consequence of Sound|accessdate=February 5, 2020}}</ref> Jacob Carey of ''[[Exclaim!]]'' criticized the length of the album, stating: \"While ''Funeral'' isn't necessarily a flop, the album would have ranked higher in Lil Wayne's discography had he cut the tracklist in half and opted for quality over quantity. Overall, ''Funeral'' lacks replay value compared to the multiple 'best of the year' albums that Wayne has proven capable of creating.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://exclaim.ca/music/article/lil_wayne-funeral|title=Lil Wayne Funeral|website=exclaim.ca|accessdate=February 5, 2020}}</ref>\n\n''[[NME]]'''s Thomas Hobbs found the album inconsistent, writing: \"The problem with ''Funeral'' is that there's no real thread holding the music together. For every exhilarating left turn ('Mama Mia' was made to open up the mosh pits), there's a soulless radio anthem such as 'Clap For Em' \u2013 and that's before we even mention the unspeakable [[Adam Levine]] duet 'Trust Nobody'. At nearly 80 minutes long, ''Funeral'' is obviously bloated and an attempt to play into streaming politics, and it's a real shame that the ambitious druggy swirl of some of the earlier material is replaced with more formulaic songwriting\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/reviews/lil-wayne-funeral-review-the-big-kid-2604385|title=Lil Wayne \u2013 'Funeral' review|date=February 2, 2020|website=NME||accessdate=February 5, 2020}}</ref> \n\nDanny Schwartz of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' gave the album a negative review, saying \"''Funeral'' is wildly uneven, a landscape of pronounced highs and lows. In truth, it peaks early, on 'Mahogany'.\" Schwartz called \"Trust Nobody\" the worst song on the album, labeling it a \"sunk by a banal and out-of-place Adam Levine hook, while noting that \"Get Out Of My Head\" is \"soured by the great rap pedant [[XXXTentacion]]\" and called \"Sights and Silencers\" a \"surprisingly limp [[The-Dream]] ballad that he should have just given to [[Jeremih]]\". Schwartz concluded: \"''Funeral'' is pockmarked with [[Dud|duds]] [...]  Lil Wayne's previous album, ''[[Tha Carter V]]'', was also overlong, but it was at least anchored by a gentle familial undercurrent. Aside from a few moments, like 'Bastard (Satan's Kid)' which touches on Wayne's father's neglectful parenting, ''Funeral'' is emotionally adrift. As Wayne heads into a new decade\u2014his fourth as a professional rapper\u2014it's hard to [know] where his head is at, where he's coming from, or where he's going\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/lil-wayne-funeral-946939/|title=Lil Wayne Displays Moments of Genius on the Wildly Uneven 'Funeral'|last=Schwartz|first=Danny|date=February 3, 2020|website=Rolling Stone|accessdate=February 5, 2020}}</ref>\n\nConversely, [[Pitchfork (website)|''Pitchfork'']]'s Sheldon Pearce gave an overall positive review, saying \"Weezy is back in the booth and cruising, experimenting with an array of styles and a dizzying maze of wordplay\".<ref name=\"Pitchfork\" /> Furthermore, writing for [[The Guardian|''The Guardian'']], Kitty Empire gave the album a positive review, saying \"Wayne's unheralded 13th studio album proves that the 37-year-old's flow can still be fearsome, even if his edit function remains iffy\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/09/lil-wayne-funeral-review|title=Lil Wayne: Funeral review \u2013 fearsome and full of life|last=Empire|first=Kitty|date=February 9, 2020|website=The Guardian|accessdate=February 13, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Commercial performance==\n''Funeral'' debuted atop the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] dated February 15, 2020, with 139,000 [[album-equivalent unit]]s, of which 38,000 were pure album sales.

For his new decade debut, Wayne takes a 'throw everything at the wall and see what sticks' approach, only hitting the target about half the time. Wayne is at his best when he dives into a beat and shows off his technical skill. He still has endless punchlines to punctuate his effortless flow. He still has clear vision and awareness of his place in the hip-hop game. However, Wayne is not a great editor, and thus listening to ''Funeral'' can become exhausting about halfway through. While listeners may be fatigued, however, Wayne is far from it. ''Funeral'' isn't an ending point or a period at the end of a successful career. It's an ellipsis, a thought to be continued next time Weezy graces the studio\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2020/02/album-review-lil-wayne-funeral/|title=Album Review: Lil Wayne's Funeral Celebrates a Life That's Far from Over|date=February 3, 2020|website=Consequence of Sound|accessdate=February 5, 2020}}</ref> Jacob Carey of ''[[Exclaim!]]'' criticized the length of the album, stating: \"While ''Funeral'' isn't necessarily a flop, the album would have ranked higher in Lil Wayne's discography had he cut the tracklist in half and opted for quality over quantity. Overall, ''Funeral'' lacks replay value compared to the multiple 'best of the year' albums that Wayne has proven capable of creating.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://exclaim.ca/music/article/lil_wayne-funeral|title=Lil Wayne Funeral|website=exclaim.ca|accessdate=February 5, 2020}}</ref>\n\n''[[NME]]'''s Thomas Hobbs found the album inconsistent, writing: \"The problem with ''Funeral'' is that there's no real thread holding the music together. For every exhilarating left turn ('Mama Mia' was made to open up the mosh pits), there's a soulless radio anthem such as 'Clap For Em' \u2013 and that's before we even mention the unspeakable [[Adam Levine]] duet 'Trust Nobody'. At nearly 80 minutes long, ''Funeral'' is obviously bloated and an attempt to play into streaming politics, and it's a real shame that the ambitious druggy swirl of some of the earlier material is replaced with more formulaic songwriting\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/reviews/lil-wayne-funeral-review-the-big-kid-2604385|title=Lil Wayne \u2013 'Funeral' review|date=February 2, 2020|website=NME||accessdate=February 5, 2020}}</ref> \n\nDanny Schwartz of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' gave the album a negative review, saying \"''Funeral'' is wildly uneven, a landscape of pronounced highs and lows. In truth, it peaks early, on 'Mahogany'.\" Schwartz called \"Trust Nobody\" the worst song on the album, labeling it a \"sunk by a banal and out-of-place Adam Levine hook, while noting that \"Get Out Of My Head\" is \"soured by the great rap pedant [[XXXTentacion]]\" and called \"Sights and Silencers\" a \"surprisingly limp [[The-Dream]] ballad that he should have just given to [[Jeremih]]\". Schwartz concluded: \"''Funeral'' is pockmarked with [[Dud|duds]] [...]  Lil Wayne's previous album, ''[[Tha Carter V]]'', was also overlong, but it was at least anchored by a gentle familial undercurrent. Aside from a few moments, like 'Bastard (Satan's Kid)' which touches on Wayne's father's neglectful parenting, ''Funeral'' is emotionally adrift. As Wayne heads into a new decade\u2014his fourth as a professional rapper\u2014it's hard to [know] where his head is at, where he's coming from, or where he's going\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/lil-wayne-funeral-946939/|title=Lil Wayne Displays Moments of Genius on the Wildly Uneven 'Funeral'|last=Schwartz|first=Danny|date=February 3, 2020|website=Rolling Stone|accessdate=February 5, 2020}}</ref>\n\nConversely, [[Pitchfork (website)|''Pitchfork'']]'s Sheldon Pearce gave an overall positive review, saying \"Weezy is back in the booth and cruising, experimenting with an array of styles and a dizzying maze of wordplay\".<ref name=\"Pitchfork\" /> Furthermore, writing for [[The Guardian|''The Guardian'']], Kitty Empire gave the album a positive review, saying \"Wayne's unheralded 13th studio album proves that the 37-year-old's flow can still be fearsome, even if his edit function remains iffy\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/09/lil-wayne-funeral-review|title=Lil Wayne: Funeral review \u2013 fearsome and full of life|last=Empire|first=Kitty|date=February 9, 2020|website=The Guardian|accessdate=February 13, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Commercial performance==\n''Funeral'' debuted atop the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] dated February 15, 2020, with 139,000 [[album-equivalent unit]]s, of which 38,000 were pure album sales.
