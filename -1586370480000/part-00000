The Moon was near its northernmost [[ecliptic coordinate system|ecliptic latitude]], so the southern [[lunar craters|craters]] are especially prominent.]]\n\n\nThe '''full moon''' is the [[lunar phase]] when the [[Moon]] appears fully illuminated from [[Earth]]'s perspective. This occurs when Earth is located between the [[Sun]] and the Moon (more exactly, when the [[ecliptic coordinate system|ecliptic longitudes]] of the Sun and Moon [[opposition (astronomy)|differ by 180\u00b0]]).<ref>[P.&nbsp;Kenneth Seidelmann (ed.), [https://archive.org/details/131123ExplanatorySupplementAstronomicalAlmanac/page/n253 \"Phases of the Moon\"], ''Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac: A Revision to the Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Ephemeris and the American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac'', (Mill Valley: University Science Books, 1992), p.&nbsp;478.</ref> This means that the lunar hemisphere facing Earth \u2013 the [[near side of the Moon|near side]] \u2013 is completely sunlit and appears as a circular disk. The full moon occurs roughly once a [[month]].\n\nThe time interval between a full (or new) moon and the next repetition of the same phase, a [[Lunar month#Synodic month|synodic month]], averages about 29.53 days. Therefore, in those [[lunar calendar]]s in which each month begins on the day of the new moon, the full moon falls on either the 14th or 15th day of the [[lunar month]]. Because a calendar month consists of a [[Natural number|whole number]] of days, a month in a lunar calendar may be either 29 or 30 days long.\n\n==Characteristics==\nA full moon is often thought of as an event of a full night's duration. This is somewhat misleading because [[lunar phase|its phase]] seen from Earth continuously waxes or wanes (though much too slowly to notice in real time with the [[naked eye]]). By definition, its maximum illumination occurs at the moment waxing stops. For any given location, about half of these maximum full moons may be visible, while the other half occurs during the day, when the full moon is below the horizon.\n\nMany [[almanac]]s list full moons not only by date, but also by their exact time, usually in [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC). Typical monthly [[calendar]]s that include lunar phases may be offset by one day when prepared for a different [[time zone]].\n\nThe full moon is generally a suboptimal time for [[astronomical observation]] of the Moon because shadows vanish. It is a poor time for other observations because the bright [[moonlight|sunlight reflected]] by the Moon, amplified by the [[opposition surge]], then [[skyglow|outshines]] many stars.\n\nOn 12 December 2008, the full moon was [[perigee|closer]] to the Earth than it had been at any time in the previous 15 years. This was referred to in popular media as a [[supermoon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2008/09dec_fullmoon.htm|title=Biggest Full Moon of the Year|last=Phillips|first=Tony|work=Science@NASA|date=9 December 2008|accessdate=4 March 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309230240/http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2008/09dec_fullmoon.htm|archive-date=9 March 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOn 19 March 2011, there was another full \"supermoon\", closer to the Earth than at any time in the previous 18 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2011/16mar_supermoon/|title=Super Full Moon|last=Phillips|first=Tony|work=Science@NASA|date=16 March 2011|accessdate=13 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507035348/https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2011/16mar_supermoon/|archive-date=7 May 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOn 14 November 2016, there was another full \"supermoon\"; this time it was closer to the Earth than at any time in the previous 68 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/news-articles/2016-ends-with-3-supermoons|title=Super Full Moon|last=Phillips|first=Tony|work=Science@NASA|date=14 October 2016|accessdate=13 November 2016}}{{Dead link|date=December 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n=== Formula ===\nThe date and approximate time of a specific full moon (assuming a circular orbit) can be calculated from the following equation:<ref>{{Cite book| first = Jean | last = Meeus | date= 1998 | title = Astronomical Algorithms | edition = 2nd |isbn = 0-943396-61-1| chapter = Phases of the Moon | pages = 349\u2013354 | publisher = Willmann-Bell | location = Richmond, Virginia}}</ref>\n:<math> d = 20.362000+ 29.530588861 \\times N + 102.026 \\times 10^{-12} \\times N^2</math>\nwhere ''d'' is the number of days since 1 January 2000 00:00:00 in the [[Terrestrial Time]] scale used in astronomical [[Ephemeris|ephemerides]]; for [[Universal Time]] (UT) add the following approximate correction to ''d'':\n: <math>-0.000739 - (235 \\times 10^{-12})\\times N^2</math> days\nwhere ''N'' is the number of full moons since the first full moon of 2000.

A lunar eclipse does not occur every month because the Moon's orbit is [[orbital inclination|inclined]] 5.14\u00b0 with respect to the [[ecliptic]] plane of Earth; thus, the Moon usually passes north or south of Earth's shadow, which is mostly restricted to this [[plane of reference]]. Lunar eclipses happen only when the full moon occurs around either [[orbital node|node of its orbit]] (ascending or descending). Therefore, a lunar eclipse occurs about every six months, and often two weeks before or after a [[solar eclipse]], which occurs during a [[new moon]] around the opposite node.\n\n==In folklore and tradition==\n{{See also|List of lunar deities|Lunar effect}}\n[[File:Moon and red blue haze.jpg|thumb|A full moon rising, seen through the [[Belt of Venus]]]]\nFull moons are traditionally associated with [[insomnia]] (inability to sleep), [[insanity]] (hence the terms ''lunacy'' and ''lunatic'') and various \"magical phenomena\" such as lycanthropy. Psychologists, however, have found that there is no strong evidence for effects on human behavior around the time of a full moon.<ref>{{cite web|title=Full Moon Effect On Behavior Minimal, Studies Say|date=6 February 2004|work=National Geographic News|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/12/1218_021218_moon.html}}</ref> They find that studies are generally not consistent, with some showing a positive effect and others showing a negative effect. In one instance, the 23 December 2000 issue of the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' published two studies on dog bite admission to hospitals in England and Australia. The study of the [[Bradford Royal Infirmary]] found that dog bites were twice as common during a full moon, whereas the study conducted by the public hospitals in Australia found that they were less likely.\n\n===Full moon names===\nHistorically, month names are names of moons ([[lunation]]s, not necessarily full moons) in [[lunisolar calendar]]s. Since the introduction of the solar [[Julian calendar]] in the Roman Empire, and later the [[Gregorian calendar]] worldwide, people no longer perceive month names as \"moon\" names. The traditional [[Germanic calendar#Month names|Old English month names]] were equated with the names of the Julian calendar from an early time (soon after [[Christianization of Anglo-Saxon England|Christianization]], according to the testimony of [[Bede]] around AD 700).\n\nSome full moons have developed new names in modern times, such as \"[[blue moon]]\", as well as \"harvest moon\" and \"hunter's moon\" for the full moons of autumn.\n\n[[Lunar eclipse]]s occur only at a full moon and often cause a reddish hue on the [[near side of the Moon]].

The term \"blue moon\" used in this sense may date to as early as the 16th century, but it became well-known in the United States due to the ''Farmers' Almanac'' (published since 1818).<ref>\nThe saying \"once in a blue moon\" meaning \"very rarely\" is recorded since the 1820s.\nThe term \"blue moon\" is recorded in 1528, in the couplet ''O churche men are wyly foxes [...] Yf they say the mone is blewe / We must beleve that it is true / Admittynge their interpretacion.'' ([[Thomas Wolsey]], ''Rede me and be nott wrothe, for I say no thynge but trothe'' ed. 1871 [https://archive.org/stream/redemeandbenottw00roywuoft#page/n121/mode/2up p. 114]); it isn't clear however if this refers to intercalation.</ref>\n\nAccording to the ''Farmers' Almanac'', a \"blue moon\" is the third full moon in any period between either solstice and equinox, or between equinox and solstice, (calculated using the [[mean tropical year]]), which contains four full moons.<ref>Farmers' Almanac, \"What is a blue moon?\", 24 August 2009, available at [http://farmersalmanac.com/astronomy/2009/08/24/what-is-a-blue-moon] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180124181408/https://www.farmersalmanac.com/astronomy/2009/08/24/what-is-a-blue-moon/ |date=2018-01-24 }}.</ref> These seasons are equal in length, unlike the astronomical ones, which vary in length depending on the Earth's speed in its elliptical orbit round the Sun. To compare, in 1983 the equal length seasons began at 1:48 am on 23 March, 9:15 am on 22 June, 4:42 pm on 21 September and 12:10 am on 22 December, while the astronomical seasons began at 4:39 am on 21 March, 11:09 pm on 21 June, 2:42 pm on 23 September and 10:30 am on 22 December (all times GMT). Due to a misinterpretation of this definition in the March 1946 ''[[Sky & Telescope]]'' magazine, \"blue moon\" has also been used in the sense of \"the second full moon in any month which contains two full moons (this usage has been noted as \"erroneous\" by ''Sky & Telescope'' in 1999).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/objects/moon/3304131.html |title=''Sky and Telescope'' \"What's a blue moon?\" |access-date=2009-10-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327035511/http://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/objects/moon/3304131.html |archive-date=2014-03-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref> According to either definition, \"blue moons\" occur with the average frequency of intercalary months, seven times in 19 years, the ''Farmers' Almanac'' system of \"full moon names\" effectively defining a lunisolar calendar.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Solar System}}\n* [[Lunar eclipse]]\n* [[Lunar phase]]\n* [[Month]]\n* [[Near side of the Moon]]\n* [[New moon]]\n* [[Orbit of the Moon]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Full moon}}\n* [http://stardate.org/nightsky/moon/ Moon phase calculator]\n* {{youtube|n2MtEsrcTTs|Neil Young \u2013 Harvest Moon}}\n\n{{The Moon}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Full Moon}}\n[[Category:Full moon| ]]\n[[Category:Phases of the Moon]]\n[[Category:Observational astronomy]]\n", "text_old": "{{Other uses|Full moon (disambiguation)|Harvest moon (disambiguation)|Hunter's moon (disambiguation)}}\n{{redirect|Strawberry Moon| the jazz album by Grover Washington Jr.|Strawberry Moon (album)}}\n{{short description|Lunar phase: completely illuminated disc}}\n[[File:Supermoon Nov-14-2016-minneapolis.jpg|thumb|The [[supermoon]] of 14 November 2016 was {{convert|356511|km|mi|abbr=on}} away<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sivertimes.com/super-moon-exceptional-brightest-moon-in-the-sky-of-normandy-monday-november-14/1872 |title=\"SUPER MOON\" EXCEPTIONAL.

The Moon was near its northernmost [[ecliptic coordinate system|ecliptic latitude]], so the southern [[lunar craters|craters]] are especially prominent.]]\n\n\nThe '''full moon''' is the [[lunar phase]] when the [[Moon]] appears fully illuminated from [[Earth]]'s perspective. This occurs when Earth is located between the [[Sun]] and the Moon (more exactly, when the [[ecliptic coordinate system|ecliptic longitudes]] of the Sun and Moon [[opposition (astronomy)|differ by 180\u00b0]]).<ref>[P.&nbsp;Kenneth Seidelmann (ed.), [https://archive.org/details/131123ExplanatorySupplementAstronomicalAlmanac/page/n253 \"Phases of the Moon\"], ''Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac: A Revision to the Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Ephemeris and the American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac'', (Mill Valley: University Science Books, 1992), p.&nbsp;478.</ref> This means that the lunar hemisphere facing Earth \u2013 the [[near side of the Moon|near side]] \u2013 is completely sunlit and appears as a circular disk. The full moon occurs roughly once a [[month]].\n\nThe time interval between a full (or new) moon and the next repetition of the same phase, a [[Lunar month#Synodic month|synodic month]], averages about 29.53 days. Therefore, in those [[lunar calendar]]s in which each month begins on the day of the new moon, the full moon falls on either the 14th or 15th day of the [[lunar month]]. Because a calendar month consists of a [[Natural number|whole number]] of days, a month in a lunar calendar may be either 29 or 30 days long.\n\n==Characteristics==\nA full moon is often thought of as an event of a full night's duration. This is somewhat misleading because [[lunar phase|its phase]] seen from Earth continuously waxes or wanes (though much too slowly to notice in real time with the [[naked eye]]). By definition, its maximum illumination occurs at the moment waxing stops. For any given location, about half of these maximum full moons may be visible, while the other half occurs during the day, when the full moon is below the horizon.\n\nMany [[almanac]]s list full moons not only by date, but also by their exact time, usually in [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC). Typical monthly [[calendar]]s that include lunar phases may be offset by one day when prepared for a different [[time zone]].\n\nThe full moon is generally a suboptimal time for [[astronomical observation]] of the Moon because shadows vanish. It is a poor time for other observations because the bright [[moonlight|sunlight reflected]] by the Moon, amplified by the [[opposition surge]], then [[skyglow|outshines]] many stars.\n\nOn 12 December 2008, the full moon was [[perigee|closer]] to the Earth than it had been at any time in the previous 15 years. This was referred to in popular media as a [[supermoon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2008/09dec_fullmoon.htm|title=Biggest Full Moon of the Year|last=Phillips|first=Tony|work=Science@NASA|date=9 December 2008|accessdate=4 March 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309230240/http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2008/09dec_fullmoon.htm|archive-date=9 March 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOn 19 March 2011, there was another full \"supermoon\", closer to the Earth than at any time in the previous 18 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2011/16mar_supermoon/|title=Super Full Moon|last=Phillips|first=Tony|work=Science@NASA|date=16 March 2011|accessdate=13 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507035348/https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2011/16mar_supermoon/|archive-date=7 May 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOn 14 November 2016, there was another full \"supermoon\"; this time it was closer to the Earth than at any time in the previous 68 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/news-articles/2016-ends-with-3-supermoons|title=Super Full Moon|last=Phillips|first=Tony|work=Science@NASA|date=14 October 2016|accessdate=13 November 2016}}{{Dead link|date=December 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n=== Formula ===\nThe date and approximate time of a specific full moon (assuming a circular orbit) can be calculated from the following equation:<ref>{{Cite book| first = Jean | last = Meeus | date= 1998 | title = Astronomical Algorithms | edition = 2nd |isbn = 0-943396-61-1| chapter = Phases of the Moon | pages = 349\u2013354 | publisher = Willmann-Bell | location = Richmond, Virginia}}</ref>\n:<math> d = 20.362000+ 29.530588861 \\times N + 102.026 \\times 10^{-12} \\times N^2</math>\nwhere ''d'' is the number of days since 1 January 2000 00:00:00 in the [[Terrestrial Time]] scale used in astronomical [[Ephemeris|ephemerides]]; for [[Universal Time]] (UT) add the following approximate correction to ''d'':\n: <math>-0.000739 - (235 \\times 10^{-12})\\times N^2</math> days\nwhere ''N'' is the number of full moons since the first full moon of 2000.

A lunar eclipse does not occur every month because the Moon's orbit is [[orbital inclination|inclined]] 5.14\u00b0 with respect to the [[ecliptic]] plane of Earth; thus, the Moon usually passes north or south of Earth's shadow, which is mostly restricted to this [[plane of reference]]. Lunar eclipses happen only when the full moon occurs around either [[orbital node|node of its orbit]] (ascending or descending). Therefore, a lunar eclipse occurs about every six months, and often two weeks before or after a [[solar eclipse]], which occurs during a [[new moon]] around the opposite node.\n\n==In folklore and tradition==\n{{See also|List of lunar deities|Lunar effect}}\n[[File:Moon and red blue haze.jpg|thumb|A full moon rising, seen through the [[Belt of Venus]]]]\nFull moons are traditionally associated with [[insomnia]] (inability to sleep), [[insanity]] (hence the terms ''lunacy'' and ''lunatic'') and various \"magical phenomena\" such as lycanthropy. Psychologists, however, have found that there is no strong evidence for effects on human behavior around the time of a full moon.<ref>{{cite web|title=Full Moon Effect On Behavior Minimal, Studies Say|date=6 February 2004|work=National Geographic News|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/12/1218_021218_moon.html}}</ref> They find that studies are generally not consistent, with some showing a positive effect and others showing a negative effect.

The study of the [[Bradford Royal Infirmary]] found that dog bites were twice as common during a full moon, whereas the study conducted by the public hospitals in Australia found that they were less likely.\n\n===Full moon names===\nHistorically, month names are names of moons ([[lunation]]s, not necessarily full moons) in [[lunisolar calendar]]s. Since the introduction of the solar [[Julian calendar]] in the Roman Empire, and later the [[Gregorian calendar]] worldwide, people no longer perceive month names as \"moon\" names. The traditional [[Germanic calendar#Month names|Old English month names]] were equated with the names of the Julian calendar from an early time (soon after [[Christianization of Anglo-Saxon England|Christianization]], according to the testimony of [[Bede]] around AD 700).\n\nSome full moons have developed new names in modern times, such as \"[[blue moon]]\", as well as \"harvest moon\" and \"hunter's moon\" for the full moons of autumn.\n\n[[Lunar eclipse]]s occur only at a full moon and often cause a reddish hue on the [[near side of the Moon]].

A small horizontal [[libration]] is visible comparing their appearances. By the 19-year [[metonic cycle]] the full moon will repeat on Christmas day in 2034, 2053, 2072, and 2091.<ref>[http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/weather/ct-wea-1221-asktom-20151220-column.html Ask Tom: How unusual is a full moon on Christmas Day?]</ref>]]\n{{Main|Lunar calendar}}\nMost pre-modern calendars the world over were [[lunisolar]], combining the solar year with the lunation by means of [[intercalary month]]s.<ref>see e.g., {{Cite book | first = Bonnie | last = Blackburn | display-authors = etal | date = 1999 | title = The Oxford Companion to the Year | isbn = 0-19-214231-3 | publisher = Oxford University Press | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00blac }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book| first = Edward M. | last = Reingold |display-authors=etal | date= 2001 | title = Calendrical Calculations: The Millennium Edition |title-link= Calendrical Calculations | isbn = 0-521-77752-6 | publisher = Cambridge University Press}}</ref>\nThe Julian calendar abandoned this method in favour of a purely solar reckoning while conversely the 7th-century [[Islamic calendar]] opted for a purely lunar one.\n\nA continuing lunisolar calendar is the [[Hebrew calendar]]. Evidence of this is noted in the dates of [[Passover]] and [[Easter]] in Judaism and Christianity, respectively. Passover falls on the full moon on 15 Nisan of the Hebrew calendar. The date of the Jewish [[Rosh Hashana]] and [[Sukkot]] festivals along with all other [[Jewish holidays]] are dependent on the dates of the new moons.<ref>[[Leviticus]] 23:4-7, 33-35.</ref>\n\n===Intercalary months===\n{{main|Intercalary month}}\nIn lunisolar calendars, an intercalary month occurs seven times in the 19 years of the [[Metonic cycle]], or on average every 2.7 years (19/7). In the [[Hebrew Calendar]] this is noted with a periodic extra month of [[Adar]] in the early spring.\n\n==== Blue moon====\n{{further|Blue moon}}\nIn the modern system of \"traditional\" full moon names tied to the [[solstice]] and [[equinox]] points, a supernumerary full moon in such a period is called a blue moon. The term \"blue moon\" used in this sense may date to as early as the 16th century, but it became well-known in the United States due to the ''Farmers' Almanac'' (published since 1818).<ref>\nThe saying \"once in a blue moon\" meaning \"very rarely\" is recorded since the 1820s.\nThe term \"blue moon\" is recorded in 1528, in the couplet ''O churche men are wyly foxes [...] Yf they say the mone is blewe / We must beleve that it is true / Admittynge their interpretacion.'' ([[Thomas Wolsey]], ''Rede me and be nott wrothe, for I say no thynge but trothe'' ed. 1871 [https://archive.org/stream/redemeandbenottw00roywuoft#page/n121/mode/2up p. 114]); it isn't clear however if this refers to intercalation.</ref>\n\nAccording to the ''Farmers' Almanac'', a \"blue moon\" is the third full moon in any period between either solstice and equinox, or between equinox and solstice, (calculated using the [[mean tropical year]]), which contains four full moons.<ref>Farmers' Almanac, \"What is a blue moon?\", 24 August 2009, available at [http://farmersalmanac.com/astronomy/2009/08/24/what-is-a-blue-moon] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180124181408/https://www.farmersalmanac.com/astronomy/2009/08/24/what-is-a-blue-moon/ |date=2018-01-24 }}.</ref> These seasons are equal in length, unlike the astronomical ones, which vary in length depending on the Earth's speed in its elliptical orbit round the Sun. To compare, in 1983 the equal length seasons began at 1:48 am on 23 March, 9:15 am on 22 June, 4:42 pm on 21 September and 12:10 am on 22 December, while the astronomical seasons began at 4:39 am on 21 March, 11:09 pm on 21 June, 2:42 pm on 23 September and 10:30 am on 22 December (all times GMT). Due to a misinterpretation of this definition in the March 1946 ''[[Sky & Telescope]]'' magazine, \"blue moon\" has also been used in the sense of \"the second full moon in any month which contains two full moons (this usage has been noted as \"erroneous\" by ''Sky & Telescope'' in 1999).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/objects/moon/3304131.html |title=''Sky and Telescope'' \"What's a blue moon?\" |access-date=2009-10-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327035511/http://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/objects/moon/3304131.html |archive-date=2014-03-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref> According to either definition, \"blue moons\" occur with the average frequency of intercalary months, seven times in 19 years, the ''Farmers' Almanac'' system of \"full moon names\" effectively defining a lunisolar calendar.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Solar System}}\n* [[Lunar eclipse]]\n* [[Lunar phase]]\n* [[Month]]\n* [[Near side of the Moon]]\n* [[New moon]]\n* [[Orbit of the Moon]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Full moon}}\n* [http://stardate.org/nightsky/moon/ Moon phase calculator]\n* {{youtube|n2MtEsrcTTs|Neil Young - Harvest Moon}}\n\n{{The Moon}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Full Moon}}\n[[Category:Full moon| ]]\n[[Category:Phases of the Moon]]\n[[Category:Observational astronomy]]\n", "name_user": "Srich32977", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixed typo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_moon"}

However, Ravaisson developed his doctrine as what he called \u2018spiritualist realism\u2019 and \u2018spiritualist positivism\u2019, and - according to Ravaisson scholar [[Mark Sinclair (philosopher)|Mark Sinclair]] - can be thought of as founding 'the school of contingency'.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-9-10\">\"Sinclair (2019), pp. 9-10</ref> His most well known and influential successor was [[Henri Bergson]], with whom the tradition can be seen to end during the 1930s;<ref name=\"SinclairBI-1\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 1</ref> although the 'lineage' of this 'philosophy of life' can be seen to return in the late twentieth century with [[Gilles Deleuze]].<ref name=\"GroszHT-219\">\"Grosz (2013), p. 219</ref> Ravaisson never worked in the French state university system, in his late 20s declining a position at the University of Rennes.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-7\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 7</ref> In 1838 he was employed as the principle private secretary to the Minister of Public Instruction, going on to secure high-ranking positions such as Inspector General of Libraries, and then the Curator of Classical Antiquities at the [[Louvre]].<ref name=\"SinclairBI-8\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 8</ref> Later in his life he was appointed as the President of the Jury of the Aggregation of philosophy in France, 'a position of considerable influence'.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-9\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 9</ref> Ravaisson, was not only a philosopher, classicist, archivist, and educational administrator, but also a painter exhibiting under the name Lach\u00e9.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-8\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 8</ref> \n\n==Biography==\n\n[[File:Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau - Portrait of Jean-Gaspard-F\u00e9lix Larcher Ravaisson-Mollien.JPG|thumb|left|alt=A portrait of F\u00e9lix Ravaisson by Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau.|F\u00e9lix Ravaisson by Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau (1846)]]\n\nRavaisson was born at [[Namur]]. After a successful course of study at the [[Coll\u00e8ge-lyc\u00e9e Jacques-Decour|Coll\u00e8ge Rollin]], he went to [[University of Munich|Munich]] in autumn 1839, where he attended the lectures of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], and took his degree in philosophy in 1836. In the following year he published the first volume of his famous work ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d'Aristote'' (\"Essay on the Metaphysics of Aristotle\"), to which in 1846 he added a supplementary volume. This work not only criticizes and comments on the theories of [[Aristotle]] and the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]]s, but also develops from them a modern philosophical system.\n\nIn 1838 he received his doctorate, his thesis entitled \"De l'habitude\" (\"On Habit\"), which was to become a classic text (a metaphysical 'poem' on nature in general apprehended through an intuitive analysis of acquired habit as a particular manifestation of its essential being, much admired by Bergson and Heidegger), and became professor of philosophy at [[Rennes]]. From 1840 he was inspector-general of public libraries, and in 1860 became inspector-general in the department of higher education. He was also a member of the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences Morales et Politiques|Academy of Moral and Political Sciences]], and curator of the Department of Antiquities at the [[Louvre]] (from 1870). He died in [[Paris]].\n\nIn philosophy, he was one of the school of [[Victor Cousin]], with whom he was at issue in many important points. The act of consciousness, according to him, is the basis of all knowledge. Acts of consciousness are manifestations of will, which is the motive and creative power of the intellectual life. The idea of God is a cumulative intuition given by all the various faculties of the mind, in its observation of harmony in nature and in man. This theory had considerable influence on speculative philosophy in France during the later years of the 19th century.\n\n==Bibliography==\n\nRavaisson's 'complete' 'three major' philosophical works are: ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d\u2019Aristote'' [Vol. 1 & Vol. 2] (1837 and 1846); ''De l\u2019habitude'' (''On Habit'', 1838); and ''Rapport sur la philosophie en France au XIXeme si\u00e8cle'' (1867).<ref name=\"SinclairBI-6\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 6</ref><ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-4-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), pp. 4-5</ref> Ravaisson also produced a number of other 'noteworthy essays' such as \"La Philosophie contemporaine\" (\"Contemporary Philosophy\", 1840); \"La Philosophie de Pascale\" (\"Pascal\u2019s Philosophy\", 1887), and \"M\u00e9taphysique et Morale\" (\"Metaphysics and Morals\", 1893).<ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), p. 5</ref> Upon his death he also 'left unfinished fragments of a major work, which were published posthumously', first as \"Testament philosophique\" in ''Revue de m\u00e9taphysique et de morale'' (\"Philosophical Testament\", 1901), then later in extended form as ''Testament philosophique'' (''Philosophical Testament'', 1933).<ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), p. 5</ref><ref name=\"SinclairI-vii\">\"Sinclair (2016), p. vii</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border:none\"\n|-\n!

However, Ravaisson developed his doctrine as what he called \u2018spiritualist realism\u2019 and \u2018spiritualist positivism\u2019, and - according to Ravaisson scholar [[Mark Sinclair (philosopher)|Mark Sinclair]] - can be thought of as founding 'the school of contingency'.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-9-10\">\"Sinclair (2019), pp. 9-10</ref> His most well known and influential successor was [[Henri Bergson]], with whom the tradition can be seen to end during the 1930s;<ref name=\"SinclairBI-1\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 1</ref> although the 'lineage' of this 'philosophy of life' can be seen to return in the late twentieth century with [[Gilles Deleuze]].<ref name=\"GroszHT-219\">\"Grosz (2013), p. 219</ref> Ravaisson never worked in the French state university system, in his late 20s declining a position at the University of Rennes.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-7\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 7</ref> In 1838 he was employed as the principle private secretary to the Minister of Public Instruction, going on to secure high-ranking positions such as Inspector General of Libraries, and then the Curator of Classical Antiquities at the [[Louvre]].<ref name=\"SinclairBI-8\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 8</ref> Later in his life he was appointed as the President of the Jury of the Aggregation of philosophy in France, 'a position of considerable influence'.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-9\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 9</ref> Ravaisson, was not only a philosopher, classicist, archivist, and educational administrator, but also a painter exhibiting under the name Lach\u00e9.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-8\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 8</ref> \n\n==Biography==\n\n[[File:Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau - Portrait of Jean-Gaspard-F\u00e9lix Larcher Ravaisson-Mollien.JPG|thumb|left|alt=A portrait of F\u00e9lix Ravaisson by Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau.|F\u00e9lix Ravaisson by Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau (1846)]]\n\nRavaisson was born at [[Namur]]. After a successful course of study at the [[Coll\u00e8ge-lyc\u00e9e Jacques-Decour|Coll\u00e8ge Rollin]], he went to [[University of Munich|Munich]] in autumn 1839, where he attended the lectures of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], and took his degree in philosophy in 1836. In the following year he published the first volume of his famous work ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d'Aristote'' (\"Essay on the Metaphysics of Aristotle\"), to which in 1846 he added a supplementary volume. This work not only criticizes and comments on the theories of [[Aristotle]] and the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]]s, but also develops from them a modern philosophical system.\n\nIn 1838 he received his doctorate, his thesis entitled \"De l'habitude\" (\"On Habit\"), which was to become a classic text (a metaphysical 'poem' on nature in general apprehended through an intuitive analysis of acquired habit as a particular manifestation of its essential being, much admired by Bergson and Heidegger), and became professor of philosophy at [[Rennes]]. From 1840 he was inspector-general of public libraries, and in 1860 became inspector-general in the department of higher education. He was also a member of the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences Morales et Politiques|Academy of Moral and Political Sciences]], and curator of the Department of Antiquities at the [[Louvre]] (from 1870). He died in [[Paris]].\n\nIn philosophy, he was one of the school of [[Victor Cousin]], with whom he was at issue in many important points. The act of consciousness, according to him, is the basis of all knowledge. Acts of consciousness are manifestations of will, which is the motive and creative power of the intellectual life. The idea of God is a cumulative intuition given by all the various faculties of the mind, in its observation of harmony in nature and in man. This theory had considerable influence on speculative philosophy in France during the later years of the 19th century.\n\n==Bibliography==\n\nRavaisson's 'complete' 'three major' philosophical works are: ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d\u2019Aristote'' [Vol. 1 & Vol. 2] (1837 and 1846); ''De l\u2019habitude'' (''On Habit'', 1838); and ''Rapport sur la philosophie en France au XIXeme si\u00e8cle'' (1867).<ref name=\"SinclairBI-6\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 6</ref><ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-4-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), pp. 4-5</ref> Ravaisson also produced a number of other 'noteworthy essays' such as \"La Philosophie contemporaine\" (\"Contemporary Philosophy\", 1840); \"La Philosophie de Pascale\" (\"Pascal\u2019s Philosophy\", 1887), and \"M\u00e9taphysique et Morale\" (\"Metaphysics and Morals\", 1893).<ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), p. 5</ref> Upon his death he also 'left unfinished fragments of a major work, which were published posthumously', first as \"Testament philosophique\" in ''Revue de m\u00e9taphysique et de morale'' (\"Philosophical Testament\", 1901), then later in extended form as ''Testament philosophique'' (''Philosophical Testament'', 1933).<ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), p. 5</ref><ref name=\"SinclairI-vii\">\"Sinclair (2016), p. vii</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border:none\"\n|-\n!

An arts administrator often directs the hiring and training of personnel, devises their schedules and task assignments. Those employed by non-profit (or not-for profit in Canada) organizations are in charge of organizing fund-raising events and enlisting financial supporters. Additionally, arts administrators are expected to conduct grant research, apply for grants and disburse acquired funding so that programming can continue.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://study.com/articles/Arts_Administrator_Job_Description_Duties_and_Career_Outlook.html|title=Arts Administrator: Job Description, Duties and Career Outlook|last=|first=|date=|website=study.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n\nAn arts administrator employed by a small organization can be responsible for [[marketing|marketing events]], event booking, and managing project budges.

Focal Press. p. 84.</ref> External changes may be cultural, social, demographic, economic, political, legal, or technological.  Internal changes may be related to the audience, membership, Board of Directors, personnel, facilities, growth, or financial operations. Another change that must be taken into consideration is the growing need for technology-based marketing programs (i.e.: social media) in order for the organization to change with the times and bring younger visitor and member pools into the organization.\n\nAlthough a good arts administrator constantly monitors and manages change, they must also remain aware of the overall direction and mood of the organization while helping people do their day-to-day jobs.<ref>^ Byrnes, William, J, (2009). \"Management and the Arts\". Focal Press. p. 87.</ref>  Arts organizations, as part of the economic system, experience the effects of expansion and contractions in the local, regional, national, and world economies.<ref>^ Byrnes, William, J, (2009). \"Management and the Arts\". Focal Press. p. 93.</ref> Many arts organizations struggle in difficult economic times. Increasingly, the AAAE ([[Association of Arts Administration Educators]]) membership has become more interested and proactive in responding to key issues in the arts and in offering help to arts organizations on management, policy, governance, fund development, and financial issues. As a result of this new commitment, research in the program is growing in both amount and quality.\n\n== Government Funding, Granting Bodies and US Foundations ==\nEach country has their own models and agencies to fund the arts. In Canada the arts are funded by the Canadian government through the Department of Canadian Heritage. Each province has a ministry that funds arts and culture. Depending on the governmental party in power, the amount of funds available for the arts and culture vary. In Ontario, the Ministry that funds the arts is the Ministry of Heritage, Sport, Tourism and Culture Industries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ontario.ca/page/ministry-heritage-sport-tourism-culture-industries|title=Ministry of Heritage, Sport, Tourism and Cultural Industries|last=|first=|date=|website=Ontario.ca|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-05-06}}</ref> \n\nIn Canada there are federal, provincial and municipal granting bodies that fund the arts.

Some academic units offer certificate programs for practitioners seeking continuing education or professional development education. While programs in arts administration draw on many elements of related administration fields, such as [[business administration]], they also include specialized courses on administering [[non-profit]] arts and cultural organizations.\n\nArts administration programs award a range of credentials, including certificates and diplomas, bachelor's degrees, and master's degrees. These programs usually blend curriculum elements from existing administration programs such as [[public administration]], business administration, arts law, and [[management]]. At some institutions arts administration may be a concentration within the school's [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA) program. The MA in Arts Administration program at [[Columbia University]] is the only program that ties together curriculum elements from public and private management/administration, law, business, and finance at an [[Ivy league]] university.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tc.columbia.edu/artsadmin/|title=Arts Administration@Teachers College, Columbia University}}</ref>  Many arts administration programs include a practicum in which the student volunteers or works in an arts or cultural organization to gain practical experience.\n\nAt some universities, similar programs are called arts management (e.g. American University)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.american.edu/cas/arts-management/|title=Arts Management Degree Programs & Information {{!}} American University, Washington, DC|website=www.american.edu|accessdate=2015-04-05}}</ref>, performing arts management (e.g. DePaul University's Undergraduate music program)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://music.depaul.edu/academics/undergraduate-majors/performing-arts-management-bm/Pages/default.aspx|title=Performing Arts Management {{!}} School of Music {{!}} DePaul University|website=www.depaul.edu|accessdate=2018-06-25}}</ref>, or arts leadership (e.g. DePaul University's Graduate program, [[University of Southern California]]'s Master of Science in Arts Leadership program).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://theatre.depaul.edu/conservatory/graduate/arts-leadership/Pages/default.aspx|title=Graduate Degree in Arts Leadership {{!}} Conservatory {{!}} DePaul Theatre {{!}} DePaul University|website=theatre.depaul.edu|accessdate=2015-04-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://music.usc.edu/departments/arts-leadership/master-of-science-arts-leadership/|title=Arts Leadership {{!}} USC Thornton School of Music|website=music.usc.edu|access-date=2019-09-25}}</ref>  \n\nUniversities such as American, Wisconsin and Indiana, among many others, offer programs to students in all arts disciplines, while others are more specialized towards a particular discipline (DePaul's undergraduate and graduate theatre programs are theatre oriented, while its undergraduate music program is music oriented).  The master's degree at some schools is an [[MBA]], while other universities offer [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]], MA, and MPA degrees, largely depending on where the program is housed.  For example, at American University, the program is part of the Department of Performing Arts, whereas at Indiana University it is part of the School of Public and Environmental Affairs.  Another program differentiator of note is that the MFA is considered a terminal degree in the field, allowing graduates to apply to teach at the university level as a full-time professor.\n\nThough curricula may be similar, the atmosphere of programs may differ.  Variances between programs may often revolve around the centrality of arts versus the centrality of business skills in the curriculum.  Other programs, such as Ohio State, Indiana, and (increasingly) American, are strongly rooted in cultural policy.  Another program differentiator is the amount of time spent \"in the field,\" applying academic principles to existing arts organizations through practicum or internship experiences.  [http://www.seattleu.edu/artsci/mfa/ Seattle University's] [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] in Arts Leadership degree program requires that students spend time each quarter working with a local arts organization through a practicum.  They believe this emphasis on real-world interaction helps reinforce classwork and helps build a network of arts professionals that serves as a resource upon graduation. At George Mason University, MA in Arts Management at the College of Visual & Performing Arts (Arlington, VA) [http://artsmanagement.gmu.edu], one of the largest enrolled programs in the USA, no less than 252 hours of internship are required in at least two different arts organizations. At this institution, the faculty are required to be both academically and experientially qualified, with many being current senior arts managers at some of the Washington, DC's area most prominent visual & performing arts centers.\n\nMost programs require two years in residence, though [http://www.drexel.com/online-degrees/business-degrees/arts-administration/index.aspx Drexel University], [http://universitycollege.du.edu/mals/degree/masters/arts-development-and-program-management-online/degreeid/423 University of Denver], and [[Goucher College]] offer online options with limited residency.

An arts administrator often directs the hiring and training of personnel, devises their schedules and task assignments. Those employed by non-profit (or not-for profit in Canada) organizations are in charge of organizing fund-raising events and enlisting financial supporters. Additionally, arts administrators are expected to conduct grant research, apply for grants and disburse acquired funding so that programming can continue.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://study.com/articles/Arts_Administrator_Job_Description_Duties_and_Career_Outlook.html|title=Arts Administrator: Job Description, Duties and Career Outlook|last=|first=|date=|website=study.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n\nAn arts administrator employed by a small organization can be responsible for [[marketing|marketing events]], event booking, and managing project budges.

Focal Press. p. 84.</ref> External changes may be cultural, social, demographic, economic, political, legal, or technological.  Internal changes may be related to the audience, membership, Board of Directors, personnel, facilities, growth, or financial operations. Another change that must be taken into consideration is the growing need for technology-based marketing programs (i.e.: social media) in order for the organization to change with the times and bring younger visitor and member pools into the organization.\n\nAlthough a good arts administrator constantly monitors and manages change, they must also remain aware of the overall direction and mood of the organization while helping people do their day-to-day jobs.<ref>^ Byrnes, William, J, (2009). \"Management and the Arts\".

Increasingly, the AAAE ([[Association of Arts Administration Educators]]) membership has become more interested and proactive in responding to key issues in the arts and in offering help to arts organizations on management, policy, governance, fund development, and financial issues. As a result of this new commitment, research in the program is growing in both amount and quality.\n\n== Government Funding and Granting Bodies ==\nEach country has their own models and agencies to fund the arts. In Canada the arts are funded by the Canadian government through the Department of Canadian Heritage. Each province has a ministry that funds arts and culture. Depending on the governmental party in power, the amount of funds available for the arts and culture vary. In Ontario, the Ministry that funds the arts is the Ministry of Heritage, Sport, Tourism and Culture Industries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ontario.ca/page/ministry-heritage-sport-tourism-culture-industries|title=Ministry of Heritage, Sport, Tourism and Cultural Industries|last=|first=|date=|website=Ontario.ca|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-05-06}}</ref> \n\nIn Canada there are federal, provincial and municipal granting bodies that fund the arts.

Some academic units offer certificate programs for practitioners seeking continuing education or professional development education. While programs in arts administration draw on many elements of related administration fields, such as [[business administration]], they also include specialized courses on administering [[non-profit]] arts and cultural organizations.\n\nArts administration programs award a range of credentials, including certificates and diplomas, bachelor's degrees, and master's degrees. These programs usually blend curriculum elements from existing administration programs such as [[public administration]], business administration, arts law, and [[management]]. At some institutions arts administration may be a concentration within the school's [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA) program. The MA in Arts Administration program at [[Columbia University]] is the only program that ties together curriculum elements from public and private management/administration, law, business, and finance at an [[Ivy league]] university.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tc.columbia.edu/artsadmin/|title=Arts Administration@Teachers College, Columbia University}}</ref>  Many arts administration programs include a practicum in which the student volunteers or works in an arts or cultural organization to gain practical experience.\n\nAt some universities, similar programs are called arts management (e.g. American University)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.american.edu/cas/arts-management/|title=Arts Management Degree Programs & Information {{!}} American University, Washington, DC|website=www.american.edu|accessdate=2015-04-05}}</ref>, performing arts management (e.g. DePaul University's Undergraduate music program)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://music.depaul.edu/academics/undergraduate-majors/performing-arts-management-bm/Pages/default.aspx|title=Performing Arts Management {{!}} School of Music {{!}} DePaul University|website=www.depaul.edu|accessdate=2018-06-25}}</ref>, or arts leadership (e.g. DePaul University's Graduate program, [[University of Southern California]]'s Master of Science in Arts Leadership program).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://theatre.depaul.edu/conservatory/graduate/arts-leadership/Pages/default.aspx|title=Graduate Degree in Arts Leadership {{!}} Conservatory {{!}} DePaul Theatre {{!}} DePaul University|website=theatre.depaul.edu|accessdate=2015-04-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://music.usc.edu/departments/arts-leadership/master-of-science-arts-leadership/|title=Arts Leadership {{!}} USC Thornton School of Music|website=music.usc.edu|access-date=2019-09-25}}</ref>  \n\nUniversities such as American, Wisconsin and Indiana, among many others, offer programs to students in all arts disciplines, while others are more specialized towards a particular discipline (DePaul's undergraduate and graduate theatre programs are theatre oriented, while its undergraduate music program is music oriented).  The master's degree at some schools is an [[MBA]], while other universities offer [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]], MA, and MPA degrees, largely depending on where the program is housed.  For example, at American University, the program is part of the Department of Performing Arts, whereas at Indiana University it is part of the School of Public and Environmental Affairs.  Another program differentiator of note is that the MFA is considered a terminal degree in the field, allowing graduates to apply to teach at the university level as a full-time professor.\n\nThough curricula may be similar, the atmosphere of programs may differ.  Variances between programs may often revolve around the centrality of arts versus the centrality of business skills in the curriculum.  Other programs, such as Ohio State, Indiana, and (increasingly) American, are strongly rooted in cultural policy.  Another program differentiator is the amount of time spent \"in the field,\" applying academic principles to existing arts organizations through practicum or internship experiences.  [http://www.seattleu.edu/artsci/mfa/ Seattle University's] [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] in Arts Leadership degree program requires that students spend time each quarter working with a local arts organization through a practicum.  They believe this emphasis on real-world interaction helps reinforce classwork and helps build a network of arts professionals that serves as a resource upon graduation. At George Mason University, MA in Arts Management at the College of Visual & Performing Arts (Arlington, VA) [http://artsmanagement.gmu.edu], one of the largest enrolled programs in the USA, no less than 252 hours of internship are required in at least two different arts organizations.

Symptoms and signs of agranulocytosis include infectious lesions of the throat, the gastrointestinal tract, and skin with an overall feeling of illness and fever. A decrease in blood platelets (thrombocytopenia) also may occur. Since platelets are important for the clotting of blood, thrombocytopenia may lead to problems with excessive bleeding. Side effects are suspected and the drug is sometimes discontinued if the patient complains of recurrent episodes of sore throat.\n\nAnother life-threatening side effect is sudden, severe, [[fulminant liver failure]] resulting in death or the need for a liver transplantation, which occurs in up to 1 in 10,000 people taking propylthiouracil.

This is one of the essential steps in the formation of [[thyroxine]] (T4).<ref>Boron, WF & Boulpaep, EL. 2005. ''Medical Physiology, Updated Edition.'' Elsevier Saunders, Philadelphia, PA</ref>\n\nPTU does not inhibit the action of the [[sodium-dependent iodide transporter]] located on follicular cells' basolateral membranes. Inhibition of this step requires competitive inhibitors, such as [[perchlorate]] and [[thiocyanate]].\n\n=== T3/T4 target tissues ===\nPTU also acts by inhibiting the enzyme 5'-deiodinase ([[tetraiodothyronine 5' deiodinase]]), which converts T<sub>4</sub> to the more active form T<sub>3</sub>. (This is in contrast to [[methimazole]], which shares propylthiouracil's central mechanism, but not its peripheral one.)\n\nIt is important to recognize that these enzymes only work on the conjugated tyrosine molecules of T3 and T4: a completely different enzyme family is responsible for the deiodinase activity of iodized single tyrosine molecules within the thyroid follicular cells. For information on that enzyme family, see [[Iodotyrosine deiodinase]].\n\n==Pharmacokinetics==\nThe administration is oral, with peak serum concentrations occurring in one hour, and actively concentrated to the thyroid gland. Depending on several patient variables, however, euthyroid status may not be achieved until 2\u20134 months after treatment initiation. Of note, the drug is approximately 70% protein-bound and significantly ionized at normal physiologic pH, while the antithyroid agent [[methimazole]] is substantially less protein bound. However, both are equally transferred across the placenta.<ref name=\"ESCPG\">{{cite journal | url=http://jcem.endojournals.org/cgi/content/full/92/8_suppl/s1?maxtoshow=&hits=10&RESULTFORMAT=&author1=abalovich&searchid=1&FIRSTINDEX=0&sortspec=relevance&resourcetype=HWCIT#SEC6 | pmid=17948378 | volume=92 | issue=8 Suppl | title=Management of thyroid dysfunction during pregnancy and postpartum: an Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline | date=August 2007 | journal=J.

Symptoms and signs of agranulocytosis include infectious lesions of the throat, the gastrointestinal tract, and skin with an overall feeling of illness and fever. A decrease in blood platelets (thrombocytopenia) also may occur. Since platelets are important for the clotting of blood, thrombocytopenia may lead to problems with excessive bleeding. Side effects are suspected and the drug is sometimes discontinued if the patient complains of recurrent episodes of sore throat.\n\nAnother life-threatening side effect is sudden, severe, [[fulminant liver failure]] resulting in death or the need for a liver transplantation, which occurs in up to 1 in 10,000 people taking propylthiouracil.

This is one of the essential steps in the formation of [[thyroxine]] (T4).<ref>Boron, WF & Boulpaep, EL. 2005. ''Medical Physiology, Updated Edition.'' Elsevier Saunders, Philadelphia, PA</ref>\n\nPTU does not inhibit the action of the [[sodium-dependent iodide transporter]] located on follicular cells' basolateral membranes. Inhibition of this step requires competitive inhibitors, such as [[perchlorate]] and [[thiocyanate]].\n\n=== T3/T4 target tissues ===\nPTU also acts by inhibiting the enzyme 5'-deiodinase ([[tetraiodothyronine 5' deiodinase]]), which converts T<sub>4</sub> to the more active form T<sub>3</sub>. (This is in contrast to [[methimazole]], which shares propylthiouracil's central mechanism, but not its peripheral one.)\n\nIt is important to recognize that these enzymes only work on the conjugated tyrosine molecules of T3 and T4: a completely different enzyme family is responsible for the deiodinase activity of iodized single tyrosine molecules within the thyroid follicular cells. For information on that enzyme family, see [[Iodotyrosine deiodinase]].\n\n==Pharmacokinetics==\nThe administration is oral, with peak serum concentrations occurring in one hour, and actively concentrated to the thyroid gland. Depending on several patient variables, however, euthyroid status may not be achieved until 2\u20134 months after treatment initiation. Of note, the drug is approximately 70% protein-bound and significantly ionized at normal physiologic pH, while the antithyroid agent [[methimazole]] is substantially less protein bound. However, both are equally transferred across the placenta.<ref name=\"ESCPG\">{{cite journal | url=http://jcem.endojournals.org/cgi/content/full/92/8_suppl/s1?maxtoshow=&hits=10&RESULTFORMAT=&author1=abalovich&searchid=1&FIRSTINDEX=0&sortspec=relevance&resourcetype=HWCIT#SEC6 | pmid=17948378 | volume=92 | issue=8 Suppl | title=Management of thyroid dysfunction during pregnancy and postpartum: an Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline | date=August 2007 | journal=J.
