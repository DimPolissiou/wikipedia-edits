The stories told of a wealthy woman whose body was of normal human appearance, but whose face was that of a pig.\n\nIn the earliest forms of the story, the woman's pig-like appearance was the result of [[witchcraft]]. Following her wedding day, the pig-faced woman's new husband was granted the choice of having her appear beautiful to him but pig-like to others, or pig-like to him and beautiful to others. When her husband told her that the choice was hers, the enchantment was broken and her pig-like appearance vanished. These stories became particularly popular in England, and later in [[Ireland]].\n\nThe magical elements gradually vanished from the story, and the existence of pig-faced women began to be treated as fact. The story became particularly widespread in [[Dublin]] in the early 19th century, where it became widely believed that reclusive 18th-century philanthropist [[Griselda Steevens]] had kept herself hidden from view because she had the face of a pig. In late 1814 and early 1815, rumour swept London that a pig-faced woman was living in [[Marylebone]]. Her existence was widely reported as fact, and numerous alleged portraits of her were published. With belief in pig-faced women commonplace, unscrupulous showmen exhibited living \"pig-faced women\" at fairs. These were not genuine women, but shaven bears dressed in women's clothing.\n\nBelief in pig-faced women declined, and the last significant work to treat their existence as genuine was published in 1924. Today, the legend is almost forgotten.\n\n==Standard elements==\nWhile stories of pig-faced women vary in detail, they have the same basic form. A pregnant noblewoman would be approached by a beggar accompanied by her children, and would dismiss the beggar, and in so doing would in some way compare the beggar's children to pigs. The beggar would curse the pregnant noblewoman, and come the birth of the child it would be a girl, healthy and perfectly formed in every respect other than having the face of a pig.{{sfn|Chambers|1864|p=255}}\n\nThe child would grow up healthy, but with some of the behaviours of a pig. She would eat from a silver trough, and speak only in grunts or with a grunting sound to her speech. The only child of her parents, she would stand to inherit a large fortune, but her parents would be concerned about what would become of her after their death. They would thus make arrangements either to find a man willing to marry her, or to use their fortune to endow a hospital on condition that the hospital take care of her for the remainder of her life.{{sfn|Chambers|1864|p=255}}\n\nAlthough originating roughly simultaneously in Holland, England, and France, it was only in England, and later in Ireland, that the legend became well known and widely believed.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=86}} In 1861 [[Charles Dickens]] remarked on the longevity of the belief in pig-faced women in England, commenting that \"In every age, I suppose, there has been a pig-faced lady\".{{sfn|Dickens|1861|p=333}}\n\n==Origins==\nWhile earlier stories of humans with the appearance of animals are common, prior to the 17th century there are no recorded European stories of humans with the faces of pigs.{{sfn|Chambers|1864|p=255}}{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=87}} (An 1829 paper in the ''[[Quarterly Journal of Science, Literature, and the Arts]]'' claims that the legend was circulating in Paris in 1595 but offers no detail or corroborating evidence.{{sfn|Wadd|1829|p=38}}) The earliest versions of the story of the pig-faced woman appear to have originated roughly simultaneously in England, Holland and France, and to have become prevalent in England in late 1639.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=86}} A 1904 paper in ''Volkskunde'' magazine by Dutch historian and antiquarian [[:nl:Gerrit Jacob Boekenoogen|Gerrit Jacob Boekenoogen]] traces the earliest forms of the legend as appearing in 1638 or 1639.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=86}}\n\nThe earliest surviving version of the legend is a Dutch [[old master print|print]] about an Amsterdam woman named Jacamijntjen Jacobs. In 1621 Jacobs, while pregnant, was approached one day by a female beggar accompanied by three children, who pleaded that her children were starving. Jacobs told the beggar \"Take away your filthy pigs, I will not give you anything\". The woman replied \"Are these my children pigs? May God then give you such pigs as I have here!\" Jacobs' daughter was born with the head and face of a pig, and at the time of publication in 1638\u201339 the daughter, by then in her teens, supposedly ate from a trough and spoke in a grunting voice.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|pp=86\u201387}}\n\n[[Jan Bondeson|Bondeson]] (2006) speculates that the pig-faced woman myth originated as a fusion of two earlier stories. The mediaeval Dutch legend of [[Margaret of Holland, Countess of Henneberg|Margaret of Henneberg]] tells of a wealthy noblewoman who turned away a beggar with twins, and was herself punished by giving birth to 365 children. In a similar French folk tale, the noblewoman in question described the beggar's children as \"piglets\", and gave birth to a litter of nine piglets.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=87}}\n\nThe other significant theory about the origin of the legend, proposed by [[Robert Chambers (publisher born 1802)|Robert Chambers]] in 1864, is that a genuine child was born in the early 17th century with facial deformities resembling a pig's face and a speech impediment causing her to grunt.{{sfn|Chambers|1864|p=255}} The science of [[teratology]] (the study of birth defects and physiological abnormalities) was then in its infancy, and the theory of [[maternal impression]] (that the thoughts of a pregnant woman could influence the future appearance of her children) was widely accepted. It is possible that the birth of a genuinely deformed child led to the story of the beggar as a possible explanation for her appearance, with other elements of the story being later additions or distortions by publishers.{{sfn|Chambers|1864|p=255}} Chambers speculates that the original child may have had a similar appearance to [[Julia Pastrana]], a woman with [[hypertrichosis]] and distorted (although not pig-like) facial features,{{sfn|Chambers|1864|p=255}} who was widely exhibited in Europe and North America until her death in 1860, and then, embalmed, until the 1970s.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=45}} However, while a 1952 [[stillbirth]] with a face resembling a pig is documented, there has never been a reliably documented case of a human with deformities of this kind surviving outside the womb, while all versions of the pig-faced woman legend describe her as a healthy adult.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=88}}\n\n===Tannakin Skinker===\n[[File:A Monstrous Shape, or a Shapelesse Monster.png|right|thumb|upright|Tannakin Skinker, from ''A Monstrous Shape, or a Shapelesse Monster'', 1640|alt=Woman with a pig's head, carrying a fan]]\nThe first recorded reference in England to the legend of the pig-faced woman is the fable of Tannakin Skinker, a 17th-century variation on the traditional [[loathly lady]] story, in particular on ''[[The Wife of Bath's Tale]]'' and ''[[The Marriage of Sir Gawain]]''.{{sfn|Rollins|1922|p=449}} The Skinker story is generally considered the basis for later English stories of pig-faced women.{{sfn|Wilson|1830|p=18}} Between 4 and 11 December 1639, five ballads about Skinker were published in London,{{#tag:ref|''The Woman Monster'', ''A Maiden Monster'', ''A Strange Relation of a Female Monster'', ''A New Ballad of the Swines-faced Gentlewoman'' and ''A Wonder of These Times''.{{sfn|Rollins|1922|p=449}}|group=note}} all of which are now lost.{{sfn|Rollins|1922|p=449}} (A 1640 ballad, ''A Monstrous Shape: or, A Shapelesse Monster, a Description of a female creature born in Holland compleat in every part, save only a head like a swine, who hath travelled in many parts and is now to be seen in London, shees loving, courteous and effeminate and nere as yet could find a loving mate'', is preserved in [[Samuel Pepys]]'s extensive collection of ballads.{{sfn|Rollins|1922|p=451}}) The earliest surviving record of the Tannakin Skinker story is that given in ''A Certaine Relation of the Hog-faced Gentlewoman called Mistris Tannakin Skinker'', a 1640 [[chapbook]].{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=69}}\n\n====''A Certaine Relation of the Hog-faced Gentlewoman called Mistris Tannakin Skinker''====\n''A Certaine Relation'' claims that Tannakin Skinker was born to Joachim and Parnel Skinker in 1618 in \"Wirkham, a neuter towne betweene the Emperour and the Hollander, scituate on the river Rhyne\".{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=161}}{{#tag:ref|\"The Emperour\" refers to the [[Holy Roman Empire]], roughly modern Germany. No town called \"Wirkham\" exists on or near the Rhine.

At Tannakin's birth her body and limbs were correctly proportioned, but her face had a pig's snout, \"not only a stain and blemish, but a deformed uglinesse, making all the rest loathsome, contemptible and odious to all that lookt upon her in her infancie.\" The midwife who had delivered the baby was sworn to secrecy, and the Skinkers raised her in a private room. She ate from a silver trough, \"to which she stooped and ate, just like a Swine doth in his swilling tub\".<ref name=\"A Certaine Relation\">{{cite book|title=A Certaine Relation of the Hog-faced Gentlewoman called Mistris Tannakin Skinker|year=1640|publisher=F.

The dowry, a huge sum for the time, prompted a large number of would-be husbands. A Scottish captain arrived, having spent the greater part of a month's pay on a new suit, and was taken by Tannakin's figure and deportment. On lifting the veil to view her face, however, \"hee would stay no other conference, but ran away without further answer, saying; they must pardon him, for hee could indure no Porke.\" An English sow-man (pig farmer) assured the family that his familiarity with pigs meant he would accept Tannakin's appearance, but after meeting her he left the building, saying that \"so long as I have known Rumford, I never saw such a Hogsnout\".<ref name=\"A Certaine Relation\" />{{#tag:ref|Bondeson (2006) interprets the original \"sow-man\" as \"sowce-man\", from \"sowce\", an archaic English term for pickled pig's ears and trotters.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=71}}|group=note}}\n\nSeveral further would-be suitors visited the Skinkers, but all were repulsed by Tannakin's face and she remained unmarried.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=72}} Despairing of finding a suitable husband in Wirkham, the Skinker family moved to London, and took up residence in either [[Blackfriars, London|Blackfriars]] or [[Covent Garden]]. (The anonymous author of ''A Certaine Relation'' says that the family did not wish to divulge their address, to discourage curiosity-seekers from gathering.) Many who met her were taken by her elegant dress and excellent demeanour.<ref name=\"A Certaine Relation\" />\n\nEventually, the Skinkers found a man in London willing to marry Tannakin. On the day of the wedding, and despite all efforts to improve her appearance, her face was as pig-like as ever. With the wedding service concluded, the newly-wed couple retired to the bedroom. When they lay in bed together for the first time, Tannakin reached for her husband's arm, saying that she would release him from his vows provided that he would look at her in the face. He turned to look at her, and saw \"a sweet young Lady of incomparable beauty and feature, the like to whom to his imagination he never had in his whole life time beheld\". He reached to kiss her, but she refused, saying:{{quote|Sir, I am indeed no other than I now seeme unto you; and of these two things I give you free choice, whether I shall appeare to you thus as you now see me, young, faire, and lovely in your bed, and all the daytime, and abroad, of my former deformity: or thus beautifull in the day, to the sight of your friends, but in your armes every night of my former Age and Uglinesse: of these two things I give you free choice of, which till you have resolv'd me, there can be no other familiarity betwixt in: therefore without pause give me a speedy answer.<ref name=\"A Certaine Relation\" />}}\n\n[[File:Tannakin Skinker & suitor.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.2|Tannakin Skinker and a suitor, from ''A Certaine Relation'', 1640|alt=A man bows before an elegantly dressed woman with a pig's head. The man says \"God save you sweet mistress\"; the woman replies \"Ough\".]]\nTorn between the choice of a wife who would appear beautiful to him but hideous to all his friends, or hideous to him but beautiful to all his friends, he could not reach a decision but instead said to her \"into you owne hands and choyse I give the full power and soveraignty to make election of which you best please.\" On hearing this, Tannakin turned to him and said:{{quote|Now Sir, you have given me that which all women most desire, my Will, and Soveraignty; and know I, was by a wicked and sorcerous step-dame inchanted, never to returne to my pristine shape, till I was first married, and after had received such power from my Husband \u00b7 And now from henceforth I shall be the same to you night and day, of that youth and lively-hood which you now see mee; till Time and Age breed new alteration, even to the last period of my life.<ref name=\"A Certaine Relation\" />}}\n\n====Public reaction====\nThe fable of Tannakin Skinker was popular in England, and the idea of the pig-faced woman soon entered popular culture, to the extent that by 1654, it was recorded that one of the signs at [[Bartholomew Fair]] was \"the Signe of the Hoggs-fac'd Gentlewoman\".{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=73}} By the 1670s, [[s:The Long-Nos'd Lass|''The Long-Nos'd Lass'']] was a popular song, relating in detail how a tailor and a miller courted a woman whose \"visage was perfectly just like a Sow\" in the hope of securing her dowry (given as \u00a317,000, not the \u00a340,000 of ''A Certaine Relation''). On seeing her face each turned and fled. ''The Long-Nos'd Lass'' does not contain the magical elements of ''A Certaine Relation'', nor end in the wedding and the transformation of the pig-faced woman, the traditional ending of stories in the genre. Instead, the pig-faced woman remains unmarried, and the ballad ends:{{quote|Both Tinkers and Tanners and Glovers also<br>Came to her, the Money encouraged them so<br>Nay, thousands came to her then every day,<br>Each striving to carry this Beauty away<br>But when they beheld this most ordinary stuff.<br>The sight of her Visage did give them enuff;<br>Yet if she be Marry'd while here she does live,<br>A perfect account of the Wedding I'le give.}}\n\n==18th century==\n{{Quote box|width=31em|salign=right|quote=This Monster was a Gentlewoman of a good family and fortune, very tall and well-proportioned, of a very fine fair white skin, black hair on her head and eyebrows, but her face perfectly shaped like that of a hog or sow, except that it was not hairy; when she went abroad she covered her face with a large black velvet mask: she had a grunting voise like that of a hog, very disagreeable, but spoke very distinctly: she lived in St. Andrew's Parish in Holborn, London.{{sfn|Burton|1837|p=211}}|source=''A Woman with a Hog's Face'', James Paris du Plessis}}\nIn the 18th century, stories of pig-faced women began to be reported as fact in England.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=74}} [[James Paris du Plessis]], former servant to Samuel Pepys, told in his ''Short History of Human Prodigious & Monstrous Births'' (compiled 1731\u201333) of a pig-faced woman living in [[Holborn]] in central London, which was widely reprinted.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|pp=74\u201375}} An 1850 article in ''[[Chambers's Edinburgh Journal]]'' carried the recollections of \"a venerable and clear-headed old lady of ninety\", in which she recounted that her mother was well acquainted with a pig-faced woman, of Scottish birth but living in London, and would regularly visit her home in [[Sloane Street]].{{sfn|Chambers|1850|p=107}} In 1800, ''The Pig-faced Lady'', as \"sung at [[Astley's Amphitheatre|Astley's Theatre]],&nbsp;&c.\", was published in London by John Pitts,{{sfn|Rollins|1922|p=450}} and an 1815 editorial in ''[[The Times]]'' recounted reports of a pig-faced woman living in London as having circulated in 1764 and in the 1780s.<ref name=\"Times editorial 16 Feb 1815\">{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Editorial |section=News |day_of_week=Thursday |date=16 February 1815 |page_number=3 |url=http://infotrac.galegroup.com/itw/infomark/855/583/121724022w16/purl=rc1_TTDA_0_CS51264592&dyn=44!lnk_3+401+LTOA+CS51264592?sw_aep=wes_ttda |issue=9446 |column=G }} (subscription required)</ref>\n\n===Daughter of a Jewish convert===\nA variant form of the legend, and the only one in which the pig-faced woman is not connected with a great fortune,{{sfn|Chambers|1864|p=255}} told of a Christian man who converted to Judaism.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=91}} In this version, the first child born to him after his conversion was a girl with the face of a pig.{{sfn|Chambers|1864|p=255}} Some years later, the father realised that his daughter's appearance was a divine punishment, and re-converted to Christianity along with his pig-faced daughter. At the moment of the daughter's baptism, the holy water washed her pig-like features away, revealing a normal human face.{{sfn|Chambers|1864|p=255}} The story was alleged to be represented by a sculpture in \"one of the grand old cathedrals of Belgium\", but no evidence for such a sculpture has been found.{{sfn|Chambers|1864|p=255}}\n\n===Griselda Steevens===\n[[Griselda Steevens]] (1653 \u2013 18 March 1746), sometimes written as \"Grizel Steevens\", was the twin sister of Dr&nbsp;Richard Steevens (1653\u20131710), a Dublin physician.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=81}} Dr&nbsp;Steevens died in 1710, bequeathing an estate with an income of \u00a3606 (about \u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|606|1710|r=-3}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}) per year to Griselda.{{sfn|Townsend|1860|p=17}}{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} A clause in Dr&nbsp;Steevens' will stipulated that on Griselda's death, the income was to be used to provide a hospital for the poor of Dublin.{{sfn|Townsend|1860|p=17}}\n\n[[File:Dr Steevens' Hospital.JPG|right|thumb|Dr Steevens' Hospital|alt=Large yellow three-storey building with tall narrow windows]]\nAlthough the terms of Dr&nbsp;Steevens' will were that work on the hospital would not begin until after Griselda Steevens' death, she decided to begin work on the hospital in 1720.{{sfn|Townsend|1860|p=17}} Reserving only \u00a3120 per year for her own use, she used the remaining funds to buy a plot of land near [[Kilmainham]] and to build the new hospital, with the sole condition being that she be granted a suite of apartments in the building. As a youth Griselda had suffered a disorder of the eyes, and since then had worn a veil while in sunlight. Shy and reclusive, while conducting her charitable works in the Dublin slums she would remain in her carriage while servants gave out [[alms]] to the poor.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=82}} By 1723 a sufficient portion of the new [[Dr Steevens' Hospital]] was completed to accommodate 40 patients, in addition to Griselda's apartments.{{sfn|Chambers|1850|p=107}} The remainder of the hospital, with space for 200 patients,{{sfn|Chambers|1850|p=107}} opened in 1733.{{sfn|Townsend|1860|p=17}} Griselda lived in the hospital from 1723 until her death.{{sfn|Townsend|1860|p=17}}\n\nAt some point, it became a common belief in Dublin that Griselda Steevens had a pig's face.

Robert Chambers and [[Irish Georgian Society]] founder [[Desmond Guinness]] claim that the rumour was current in her lifetime,{{sfn|Chambers|1850|p=106}}{{sfn|Guinness|1967|p=32}} but Thomas Kirkpatrick, author of ''History of Dr Steevens' Hospital Dublin'', says that \"There is absolutely no evidence of this story in contemporary records, nor indeed does it appear to have been connected with the good lady until the nineteenth century&nbsp;[...] It is not quite certain when this story first gained circulation. Croker-King, who wrote a history of the hospital in 1785, makes no mention of it, nor is there any suggestion of it in the newspaper accounts of the death of Madam Steevens, or the published account of the hospital in the eighteenth century.\"{{sfn|\u00d3 S\u00failleabh\u00e1in|1971|p=253}}\n\nThe rumour was that Griselda Steevens' reclusiveness and always being veiled were owing to her having been born with a pig's head.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=82}} Chambers (1864) speculates that her unusual name may have contributed to the legend, and notes the common belief that she was named \"Grisly\" on account of her appearance when born.{{sfn|Chambers|1864|p=257}} It was claimed that while pregnant with Richard and Griselda, Steevens' mother had said \"take away your litter of pigs!\" to a woman beggar asking for money to feed her children, and Griselda had then been born with the head and face of a pig.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|pp=81\u201382}} Dismayed by the popular belief that she had a pig's head, Griselda took to sitting on an open balcony to allow the public to see her face.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=82}} This failed to stem the spread of the rumour, and she commissioned a portrait of herself to be hung in the main hall of the hospital.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=83}} The portrait failed to have the desired effect; many of the public chose instead to believe a portrait in a pub neighbouring the hospital, which showed Steevens with a pig's head; the pub also displayed a silver trough alleged to have belonged to her.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=83}} She eventually withdrew from public view completely before her death on 18 March 1746.{{sfn|Townsend|1860|p=17}}{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=83}}\n\nSurgeon and historian [[William Wilde]] recollected that as a medical student at Dr Steevens' Hospital in 1832 he was shown a silver trough, alleged to have belonged to Griselda Steevens, and accounts suggest that in the early 19th&nbsp;century a plaster cast of a human face with a pig's snout was on display at the hospital.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=83}} Although the hospital authorities later forbade the display of alleged Steevens memorabilia on pain of dismissal,{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=83}} in the later half of the 19th&nbsp;century the belief that Steevens had a pig's face remained common.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=84}} In the 1860s, a Dublin woman recollected that in her youth a large silver punchbowl, embossed with a family crest of a boar's head, was shown to visitors and was claimed to have been the Pig-faced Lady's trough.{{sfn|Chambers|1864|p=257}}\n\n==The Pig-faced Lady of Manchester Square==\nIn late 1814 and early 1815, a rumour swept London that a pig-faced woman was living in [[Marylebone]], an inner-city area of central London.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=75}} Said to be the daughter of an unspecified noblewoman, she was supposedly young, wealthy and living in fashionable [[Manchester Square]].{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=75}} In some reports she was described as the daughter of a noblewoman from [[Grosvenor Square]].{{sfn|Gronow|1864|p=256}} It was claimed that she would occasionally venture out of the house in a carriage, hidden by a heavy veil; several letters to the London newspapers reported sightings of a snout protruding from a window, or a veiled, silhouetted pig's head in a passing carriage.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=75}}\n\n{{Quote box|width=31em|salign=right|quote=For the attention of GENTLEMEN and LADIES.&nbsp;\u2013 A young Gentlewoman having heard of an advertisement for a person to undertake the care of a Lady who is heavily afflicted in the face, whose friends have offered a handsome income yearly, and a premium for residing with her 7 years, would do all in her power to render her life most comfortable, and undeniable character can be obtained, from a respectable circle of friends: an answer to this advertisement is requested, as the advertiser will keep herself disengaged.

It was revived with but slight effect about 30 years since; and now comes forth again in its pristine vigour. On the original invention of the pig-faced woman, about the year 1764, a man offered himself to make her an ivory trough to feed out of; which can only be considered as a feeble type of the silver cradle actually presented in our day.

Unlike the pig-faced woman reports in London, the woman's address was given. Large crowds gathered in the street outside, and a large number of letters were delivered to the address.{{sfn|Wilson|1830|p=21}}\n\nShe was eventually revealed as a hoax. A young man, his advances rebuffed by a woman, had started the story as a means of revenge. It was reported that the stream of visitors wishing to meet the Pig-faced Lady became so annoying, the young woman in question was forced to move house.{{sfn|Wilson|1830|p=21}}\n\n==Fair exhibits in the 19th century==\nIn the wake of the Pig-faced Lady scare of 1814\u201315, exhibits on the subject of pig-faced women became popular at fairs. William Wilde records that a print of ''The Wonderful Mrs Atkinson'' was a popular exhibit at an early 19th&nbsp;century Irish fair,{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|pp=84\u201385}} while larger fairs included exhibits of pig-faced women moulded in [[papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9]] or wax.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=84}} There is some evidence that a living pig-faced woman was exhibited at Bartholomew Fair in 1828, and possibly also in previous years.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=85}} (The pig-faced woman exhibited in Wakefield in 1828\u201329, recalled by George Lloyd in 1861, may have been the same one shown at Bartholomew Fair in 1828.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=85}}) At an 1843 fair in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], \"Madam Steevens, the Wonderful Pig-faced Lady\" was exhibited, and would grunt to give replies to questions from the audience.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=85}}\n\n[[File:Black bear large.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Bears stand and sit with postures similar to humans'.|alt=Bear standing on its hind legs]]\nThe pig-faced women exhibited at fairs were not genuine. Showmen would drug a bear into a stupor by feeding it large amounts of strong beer, and then shave it.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=85}} Once shaved, the drunken bear would be fitted with padded artificial breasts, and dressed in women's clothing and a wig. Shoes would be attached to the bear's hind paws, and stuffed gloves to the front paws. The bear would then be placed in a chair with a hole in the back, and securely tied to the chair.{{sfn|Chambers|1864|p=257}}\n\nOnce the bear was dressed and in the chair, the audience would be allowed into the tent. The showman would tell the audience that the Pig-faced Lady could not speak, but would answer questions put to her, with one grunt for \"yes\" and two for \"no\".{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=85}} The audience would ask her questions, and a member of the crew would poke the bear with a stick to make it grunt in reply.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|pp=85\u201386}} The Pig-faced Lady would then eat a meal of [[gruel]], beer and apples, served in a silver trough.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=85}} The display of \"pig-faced ladies\" became extremely popular, to the extent that by 1861 Charles Dickens remarked that \"no fair was complete without one\".{{sfn|Dickens|1861|p=333}} Exhibitions of this type were particularly popular in Dublin; an exhibition in Plymouth in the 1880s was less successful, and a disbelieving mob pulled the wig and hat from a \"Pig-faced Lady\" in her tent and proceeded to attack the showmen. The fate of the bear is not recorded.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=86}}\n\n==''Uncle Silas''==\nThe legend of the pig-faced woman was revived once more in 1865, in [[Sheridan Le Fanu]]'s novel ''[[Uncle Silas]]''.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=89}} ''Uncle Silas'' tells the story of Maud Ruthyn, a wealthy heiress in her late teens who lives in a secluded house, whom a number of scheming men aim to marry to secure her money.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=90}} The book includes a \"[[Barzaz Breiz|Bretagne ballad]]\" about the pig-faced woman, sung to Maud by her scheming governess Madame de la Rougierre as Rougierre leads her to a secret meeting with her cousin Dudley, who also has designs on her fortune.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=90}} (No other record of the \"Bretagne ballad\" exists, and it was almost certainly written by Le Fanu himself.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=90}}){{Quote|This lady was neither pig nor maid,<br>And so she was not of human mould;<br>Not of the living nor the dead.<br>Her left hand and foot were warm to touch;<br>Her right as cold as a corpse's flesh!<br>And she would sing like a funeral bell, with a ding-dong tune.<br>The pigs were afraid, and viewed her aloof;<br>And women feared her and stood afar.<br>She could do without sleep for a year and a day;<br>She could sleep like a corpse, for a month and more.<br>No one knew how this lady fed&nbsp;\u2013<br>On acorns or on flesh.<br>Some say that she's one of the swine-possessed,<br>That swam over the sea of Gennesaret.<br>A mongrel body and demon soul.<br>Some say she's the wife of the Wandering Jew,<br>And broke the law for the sake of pork;<br>And a swinish face for a token doth bear,<br>That her shame is now, and her punishment coming.{{sfn|Le Fanu|1864|p=72}}}}\nWhile Maud is described in the book as an attractive young woman, not a deformed monster, ''Uncle Silas'' is carefully written and plotted, and it is almost certain that Le Fanu explicitly intended a comparison between Maud's situation and the legend of the wealthy woman living in isolation and desired only for her money.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=90}} Le Fanu spent his entire life in Dublin and was editor and proprietor of the ''[[Dublin University Magazine]]'', and would certainly have been familiar with the legends of the pig-faced woman, and in particular the case of Griselda Steevens.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=90}}\n\n==Decline of the legend==\nThe 1814\u201315 Pig-faced Lady craze in London and the subsequent hoax in Paris were the last occasions in which the mainstream press reported the existence of pig-faced women as fact.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=89}} By the 1860s the fad for exhibiting \"pig-faced women\" at fairs was losing popularity,{{sfn|Dickens|1861|p=333}} although they continued to be exhibited until at least the 1880s.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=86}} Today the legend is almost forgotten.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=89}}\n\nWhile Dr Steevens' Hospital still exists, albeit now as the head office of the [[Health Service Executive]] ({{lang|ie|Feidhmeannacht na Seirbh\u00edse Sl\u00e1inte}}) rather than as a working hospital, the display of Pig-faced Lady memorabilia at the hospital had ceased by the mid-19th&nbsp;century.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=84}} The portrait commissioned by Griselda Steevens to refute the rumours about her appearance still hangs in the hospital's main hall.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=83}}\n\nThe last significant work to treat the existence of pig-faced women as fact was ''Ghosts, Helpful and Harmful'' by [[Ghost hunting|ghost hunter]] and supernatural researcher [[Elliott O'Donnell]], published in 1924.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=89}} O'Donnell alleged that the ghost of a pig-faced lady haunted a house in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]].{{sfn|O'Donnell|1924|p=229}} O'Donnell claimed that the ghost was a \"Vice Elemental, the most harmful of all the denizens of the Spirit World\".{{sfn|O'Donnell|1924|p=239}} He describes how a clergyman, \"The Rev.&nbsp;Mr&nbsp;H.\" and his family, who resided in the house, were tempted by the ghost.

The stories told of a wealthy woman whose body was of normal human appearance, but whose face was that of a pig.\n\nIn the earliest forms of the story, the woman's pig-like appearance was the result of [[witchcraft]]. Following her wedding day, the pig-faced woman's new husband was granted the choice of having her appear beautiful to him but pig-like to others, or pig-like to him and beautiful to others. When her husband told her that the choice was hers, the enchantment was broken and her pig-like appearance vanished. These stories became particularly popular in England, and later in [[Ireland]].\n\nThe magical elements gradually vanished from the story, and the existence of pig-faced women began to be treated as fact. The story became particularly widespread in [[Dublin]] in the early 19th century, where it became widely believed that reclusive 18th-century philanthropist [[Griselda Steevens]] had kept herself hidden from view because she had the face of a pig. In late 1814 and early 1815, rumour swept London that a pig-faced woman was living in [[Marylebone]]. Her existence was widely reported as fact, and numerous alleged portraits of her were published. With belief in pig-faced women commonplace, unscrupulous showmen exhibited living \"pig-faced women\" at fairs. These were not genuine women, but shaven bears dressed in women's clothing.\n\nBelief in pig-faced women declined, and the last significant work to treat their existence as genuine was published in 1924. Today, the legend is almost forgotten.\n\n==Standard elements==\nWhile stories of pig-faced women vary in detail, they have the same basic form. A pregnant noblewoman would be approached by a beggar accompanied by her children, and would dismiss the beggar, and in so doing would in some way compare the beggar's children to pigs. The beggar would curse the pregnant noblewoman, and come the birth of the child it would be a girl, healthy and perfectly formed in every respect other than having the face of a pig.{{sfn|Chambers|1864|p=255}}\n\nThe child would grow up healthy, but with some of the behaviours of a pig. She would eat from a silver trough, and speak only in grunts or with a grunting sound to her speech. The only child of her parents, she would stand to inherit a large fortune, but her parents would be concerned about what would become of her after their death. They would thus make arrangements either to find a man willing to marry her, or to use their fortune to endow a hospital on condition that the hospital take care of her for the remainder of her life.{{sfn|Chambers|1864|p=255}}\n\nAlthough originating roughly simultaneously in Holland, England, and France, it was only in England, and later in Ireland, that the legend became well known and widely believed.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=86}} In 1861 [[Charles Dickens]] remarked on the longevity of the belief in pig-faced women in England, commenting that \"In every age, I suppose, there has been a pig-faced lady\".{{sfn|Dickens|1861|p=333}}\n\n==Origins==\nWhile earlier stories of humans with the appearance of animals are common, prior to the 17th century there are no recorded European stories of humans with the faces of pigs.{{sfn|Chambers|1864|p=255}}{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=87}} (An 1829 paper in the ''[[Quarterly Journal of Science, Literature, and the Arts]]'' claims that the legend was circulating in Paris in 1595 but offers no detail or corroborating evidence.{{sfn|Wadd|1829|p=38}}) The earliest versions of the story of the pig-faced woman appear to have originated roughly simultaneously in England, Holland and France, and to have become prevalent in England in late 1639.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=86}} A 1904 paper in ''Volkskunde'' magazine by Dutch historian and antiquarian [[:nl:Gerrit Jacob Boekenoogen|Gerrit Jacob Boekenoogen]] traces the earliest forms of the legend as appearing in 1638 or 1639.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=86}}\n\nThe earliest surviving version of the legend is a Dutch [[old master print|print]] about an Amsterdam woman named Jacamijntjen Jacobs. In 1621 Jacobs, while pregnant, was approached one day by a female beggar accompanied by three children, who pleaded that her children were starving. Jacobs told the beggar \"Take away your filthy pigs, I will not give you anything\". The woman replied \"Are these my children pigs? May God then give you such pigs as I have here!\" Jacobs' daughter was born with the head and face of a pig, and at the time of publication in 1638\u201339 the daughter, by then in her teens, supposedly ate from a trough and spoke in a grunting voice.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|pp=86\u201387}}\n\n[[Jan Bondeson|Bondeson]] (2006) speculates that the pig-faced woman myth originated as a fusion of two earlier stories. The mediaeval Dutch legend of [[Margaret of Holland, Countess of Henneberg|Margaret of Henneberg]] tells of a wealthy noblewoman who turned away a beggar with twins, and was herself punished by giving birth to 365 children. In a similar French folk tale, the noblewoman in question described the beggar's children as \"piglets\", and gave birth to a litter of nine piglets.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=87}}\n\nThe other significant theory about the origin of the legend, proposed by [[Robert Chambers (publisher born 1802)|Robert Chambers]] in 1864, is that a genuine child was born in the early 17th century with facial deformities resembling a pig's face and a speech impediment causing her to grunt.{{sfn|Chambers|1864|p=255}} The science of [[teratology]] (the study of birth defects and physiological abnormalities) was then in its infancy, and the theory of [[maternal impression]] (that the thoughts of a pregnant woman could influence the future appearance of her children) was widely accepted. It is possible that the birth of a genuinely deformed child led to the story of the beggar as a possible explanation for her appearance, with other elements of the story being later additions or distortions by publishers.{{sfn|Chambers|1864|p=255}} Chambers speculates that the original child may have had a similar appearance to [[Julia Pastrana]], a woman with [[hypertrichosis]] and distorted (although not pig-like) facial features,{{sfn|Chambers|1864|p=255}} who was widely exhibited in Europe and North America until her death in 1860, and then, embalmed, until the 1970s.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=45}} However, while a 1952 [[stillbirth]] with a face resembling a pig is documented, there has never been a reliably documented case of a human with deformities of this kind surviving outside the womb, while all versions of the pig-faced woman legend describe her as a healthy adult.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=88}}\n\n===Tannakin Skinker===\n[[File:A Monstrous Shape, or a Shapelesse Monster.png|right|thumb|upright|Tannakin Skinker, from ''A Monstrous Shape, or a Shapelesse Monster'', 1640|alt=Woman with a pig's head, carrying a fan]]\nThe first recorded reference in England to the legend of the pig-faced woman is the fable of Tannakin Skinker, a 17th-century variation on the traditional [[loathly lady]] story, in particular on ''[[The Wife of Bath's Tale]]'' and ''[[The Marriage of Sir Gawain]]''.{{sfn|Rollins|1922|p=449}} The Skinker story is generally considered the basis for later English stories of pig-faced women.{{sfn|Wilson|1830|p=18}} Between 4 and 11 December 1639, five ballads about Skinker were published in London,{{#tag:ref|''The Woman Monster'', ''A Maiden Monster'', ''A Strange Relation of a Female Monster'', ''A New Ballad of the Swines-faced Gentlewoman'' and ''A Wonder of These Times''.{{sfn|Rollins|1922|p=449}}|group=note}} all of which are now lost.{{sfn|Rollins|1922|p=449}} (A 1640 ballad, ''A Monstrous Shape: or, A Shapelesse Monster, a Description of a female creature born in Holland compleat in every part, save only a head like a swine, who hath travelled in many parts and is now to be seen in London, shees loving, courteous and effeminate and nere as yet could find a loving mate'', is preserved in [[Samuel Pepys]]'s extensive collection of ballads.{{sfn|Rollins|1922|p=451}}) The earliest surviving record of the Tannakin Skinker story is that given in ''A Certaine Relation of the Hog-faced Gentlewoman called Mistris Tannakin Skinker'', a 1640 [[chapbook]].{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=69}}\n\n====''A Certaine Relation of the Hog-faced Gentlewoman called Mistris Tannakin Skinker''====\n''A Certaine Relation'' claims that Tannakin Skinker was born to Joachim and Parnel Skinker in 1618 in \"Wirkham, a neuter towne betweene the Emperour and the Hollander, scituate on the river Rhyne\".{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=161}}{{#tag:ref|\"The Emperour\" refers to the [[Holy Roman Empire]], roughly modern Germany.

The dowry, a huge sum for the time, prompted a large number of would-be husbands. A Scottish captain arrived, having spent the greater part of a month's pay on a new suit, and was taken by Tannakin's figure and deportment. On lifting the veil to view her face, however, \"hee would stay no other conference, but ran away without further answer, saying; they must pardon him, for hee could indure no Porke.\" An English sow-man (pig farmer) assured the family that his familiarity with pigs meant he would accept Tannakin's appearance, but after meeting her he left the building, saying that \"so long as I have known Rumford, I never saw such a Hogsnout\".<ref name=\"A Certaine Relation\" />{{#tag:ref|Bondeson (2006) interprets the original \"sow-man\" as \"sowce-man\", from \"sowce\", an archaic English term for pickled pig's ears and trotters.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=71}}|group=note}}\n\nSeveral further would-be suitors visited the Skinkers, but all were repulsed by Tannakin's face and she remained unmarried.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=72}} Despairing of finding a suitable husband in Wirkham, the Skinker family moved to London, and took up residence in either [[Blackfriars, London|Blackfriars]] or [[Covent Garden]]. (The anonymous author of ''A Certaine Relation'' says that the family did not wish to divulge their address, to discourage curiosity-seekers from gathering.) Many who met her were taken by her elegant dress and excellent demeanour.<ref name=\"A Certaine Relation\" />\n\nEventually, the Skinkers found a man in London willing to marry Tannakin. On the day of the wedding, and despite all efforts to improve her appearance, her face was as pig-like as ever. With the wedding service concluded, the newly-wed couple retired to the bedroom. When they lay in bed together for the first time, Tannakin reached for her husband's arm, saying that she would release him from his vows provided that he would look at her in the face. He turned to look at her, and saw \"a sweet young Lady of incomparable beauty and feature, the like to whom to his imagination he never had in his whole life time beheld\". He reached to kiss her, but she refused, saying:{{quote|Sir, I am indeed no other than I now seeme unto you; and of these two things I give you free choice, whether I shall appeare to you thus as you now see me, young, faire, and lovely in your bed, and all the daytime, and abroad, of my former deformity: or thus beautifull in the day, to the sight of your friends, but in your armes every night of my former Age and Uglinesse: of these two things I give you free choice of, which till you have resolv'd me, there can be no other familiarity betwixt in: therefore without pause give me a speedy answer.<ref name=\"A Certaine Relation\" />}}\n\n[[File:Tannakin Skinker & suitor.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.2|Tannakin Skinker and a suitor, from ''A Certaine Relation'', 1640|alt=A man bows before an elegantly dressed woman with a pig's head. The man says \"God save you sweet mistress\"; the woman replies \"Ough\".]]\nTorn between the choice of a wife who would appear beautiful to him but hideous to all his friends, or hideous to him but beautiful to all his friends, he could not reach a decision but instead said to her \"into you owne hands and choyse I give the full power and soveraignty to make election of which you best please.\" On hearing this, Tannakin turned to him and said:{{quote|Now Sir, you have given me that which all women most desire, my Will, and Soveraignty; and know I, was by a wicked and sorcerous step-dame inchanted, never to returne to my pristine shape, till I was first married, and after had received such power from my Husband \u00b7 And now from henceforth I shall be the same to you night and day, of that youth and lively-hood which you now see mee; till Time and Age breed new alteration, even to the last period of my life.<ref name=\"A Certaine Relation\" />}}\n\n====Public reaction====\nThe fable of Tannakin Skinker was popular in England, and the idea of the pig-faced woman soon entered popular culture, to the extent that by 1654, it was recorded that one of the signs at [[Bartholomew Fair]] was \"the Signe of the Hoggs-fac'd Gentlewoman\".{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=73}} By the 1670s, [[s:The Long-Nos'd Lass|''The Long-Nos'd Lass'']] was a popular song, relating in detail how a tailor and a miller courted a woman whose \"visage was perfectly just like a Sow\" in the hope of securing her dowry (given as \u00a317,000, not the \u00a340,000 of ''A Certaine Relation''). On seeing her face each turned and fled. ''The Long-Nos'd Lass'' does not contain the magical elements of ''A Certaine Relation'', nor end in the wedding and the transformation of the pig-faced woman, the traditional ending of stories in the genre. Instead, the pig-faced woman remains unmarried, and the ballad ends:{{quote|Both Tinkers and Tanners and Glovers also<br>Came to her, the Money encouraged them so<br>Nay, thousands came to her then every day,<br>Each striving to carry this Beauty away<br>But when they beheld this most ordinary stuff.<br>The sight of her Visage did give them enuff;<br>Yet if she be Marry'd while here she does live,<br>A perfect account of the Wedding I'le give.}}\n\n==18th century==\n{{Quote box|width=31em|salign=right|quote=This Monster was a Gentlewoman of a good family and fortune, very tall and well-proportioned, of a very fine fair white skin, black hair on her head and eyebrows, but her face perfectly shaped like that of a hog or sow, except that it was not hairy; when she went abroad she covered her face with a large black velvet mask: she had a grunting voise like that of a hog, very disagreeable, but spoke very distinctly: she lived in St. Andrew's Parish in Holborn, London.{{sfn|Burton|1837|p=211}}|source=''A Woman with a Hog's Face'', James Paris du Plessis}}\nIn the 18th century, stories of pig-faced women began to be reported as fact in England.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=74}} [[James Paris du Plessis]], former servant to Samuel Pepys, told in his ''Short History of Human Prodigious & Monstrous Births'' (compiled 1731\u201333) of a pig-faced woman living in [[Holborn]] in central London, which was widely reprinted.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|pp=74\u201375}} An 1850 article in ''[[Chambers's Edinburgh Journal]]'' carried the recollections of \"a venerable and clear-headed old lady of ninety\", in which she recounted that her mother was well acquainted with a pig-faced woman, of Scottish birth but living in London, and would regularly visit her home in [[Sloane Street]].{{sfn|Chambers|1850|p=107}} In 1800, ''The Pig-faced Lady'', as \"sung at [[Astley's Amphitheatre|Astley's Theatre]],&nbsp;&c.\", was published in London by John Pitts,{{sfn|Rollins|1922|p=450}} and an 1815 editorial in ''[[The Times]]'' recounted reports of a pig-faced woman living in London as having circulated in 1764 and in the 1780s.<ref name=\"Times editorial 16 Feb 1815\">{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Editorial |section=News |day_of_week=Thursday |date=16 February 1815 |page_number=3 |url=http://infotrac.galegroup.com/itw/infomark/855/583/121724022w16/purl=rc1_TTDA_0_CS51264592&dyn=44!lnk_3+401+LTOA+CS51264592?sw_aep=wes_ttda |issue=9446 |column=G }} (subscription required)</ref>\n\n===Daughter of a Jewish convert===\nA variant form of the legend, and the only one in which the pig-faced woman is not connected with a great fortune,{{sfn|Chambers|1864|p=255}} told of a Christian man who converted to Judaism.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=91}} In this version, the first child born to him after his conversion was a girl with the face of a pig.{{sfn|Chambers|1864|p=255}} Some years later, the father realised that his daughter's appearance was a divine punishment, and re-converted to Christianity along with his pig-faced daughter.

As a youth Griselda had suffered a disorder of the eyes, and since then had worn a veil while in sunlight.

Croker-King, who wrote a history of the hospital in 1785, makes no mention of it, nor is there any suggestion of it in the newspaper accounts of the death of Madam Steevens, or the published account of the hospital in the eighteenth century.\"{{sfn|\u00d3 S\u00failleabh\u00e1in|1971|p=253}}\n\nThe rumour was that Griselda Steevens' reclusiveness and always being veiled were owing to her having been born with a pig's head.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=82}} Chambers (1864) speculates that her unusual name may have contributed to the legend, and notes the common belief that she was named \"Grisly\" on account of her appearance when born.{{sfn|Chambers|1864|p=257}} It was claimed that while pregnant with Richard and Griselda, Steevens' mother had said \"take away your litter of pigs!\" to a woman beggar asking for money to feed her children, and Griselda had then been born with the head and face of a pig.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|pp=81\u201382}} Dismayed by the popular belief that she had a pig's head, Griselda took to sitting on an open balcony to allow the public to see her face.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=82}} This failed to stem the spread of the rumour, and she commissioned a portrait of herself to be hung in the main hall of the hospital.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=83}} The portrait failed to have the desired effect; many of the public chose instead to believe a portrait in a pub neighbouring the hospital, which showed Steevens with a pig's head; the pub also displayed a silver trough alleged to have belonged to her.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=83}} She eventually withdrew from public view completely before her death on 18 March 1746.{{sfn|Townsend|1860|p=17}}{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=83}}\n\nSurgeon and historian [[William Wilde]] recollected that as a medical student at Dr Steevens' Hospital in 1832 he was shown a silver trough, alleged to have belonged to Griselda Steevens, and accounts suggest that in the early 19th&nbsp;century a plaster cast of a human face with a pig's snout was on display at the hospital.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=83}} Although the hospital authorities later forbade the display of alleged Steevens memorabilia on pain of dismissal,{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=83}} in the later half of the 19th&nbsp;century the belief that Steevens had a pig's face remained common.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=84}} In the 1860s, a Dublin woman recollected that in her youth a large silver punchbowl, embossed with a family crest of a boar's head, was shown to visitors and was claimed to have been the Pig-faced Lady's trough.{{sfn|Chambers|1864|p=257}}\n\n==The Pig-faced Lady of Manchester Square==\nIn late 1814 and early 1815, a rumour swept London that a pig-faced woman was living in [[Marylebone]], an inner-city area of central London.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=75}} Said to be the daughter of an unspecified noblewoman, she was supposedly young, wealthy and living in fashionable [[Manchester Square]].{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=75}} In some reports she was described as the daughter of a noblewoman from [[Grosvenor Square]].{{sfn|Gronow|1864|p=256}} It was claimed that she would occasionally venture out of the house in a carriage, hidden by a heavy veil; several letters to the London newspapers reported sightings of a snout protruding from a window, or a veiled, silhouetted pig's head in a passing carriage.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=75}}\n\n{{Quote box|width=31em|salign=right|quote=For the attention of GENTLEMEN and LADIES.&nbsp;\u2013 A young Gentlewoman having heard of an advertisement for a person to undertake the care of a Lady who is heavily afflicted in the face, whose friends have offered a handsome income yearly, and a premium for residing with her 7 years, would do all in her power to render her life most comfortable, and undeniable character can be obtained, from a respectable circle of friends: an answer to this advertisement is requested, as the advertiser will keep herself disengaged.

William Wilde records that a print of ''The Wonderful Mrs Atkinson'' was a popular exhibit at an early 19th&nbsp;century Irish fair,{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|pp=84\u201385}} while larger fairs included exhibits of pig-faced women moulded in [[papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9]] or wax.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=84}} There is some evidence that a living pig-faced woman was exhibited at Bartholomew Fair in 1828, and possibly also in previous years.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=85}} (The pig-faced woman exhibited in Wakefield in 1828\u201329, recalled by George Lloyd in 1861, may have been the same one shown at Bartholomew Fair in 1828.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=85}}) At an 1843 fair in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], \"Madam Steevens, the Wonderful Pig-faced Lady\" was exhibited, and would grunt to give replies to questions from the audience.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=85}}\n\n[[File:Black bear large.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Bears stand and sit with postures similar to humans'.|alt=Bear standing on its hind legs]]\nThe pig-faced women exhibited at fairs were not genuine. Showmen would drug a bear into a stupor by feeding it large amounts of strong beer, and then shave it.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=85}} Once shaved, the drunken bear would be fitted with padded artificial breasts, and dressed in women's clothing and a wig. Shoes would be attached to the bear's hind paws, and stuffed gloves to the front paws. The bear would then be placed in a chair with a hole in the back, and securely tied to the chair.{{sfn|Chambers|1864|p=257}}\n\nOnce the bear was dressed and in the chair, the audience would be allowed into the tent. The showman would tell the audience that the Pig-faced Lady could not speak, but would answer questions put to her, with one grunt for \"yes\" and two for \"no\".{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=85}} The audience would ask her questions, and a member of the crew would poke the bear with a stick to make it grunt in reply.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|pp=85\u201386}} The Pig-faced Lady would then eat a meal of [[gruel]], beer and apples, served in a silver trough.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=85}} The display of \"pig-faced ladies\" became extremely popular, to the extent that by 1861 Charles Dickens remarked that \"no fair was complete without one\".{{sfn|Dickens|1861|p=333}} Exhibitions of this type were particularly popular in Dublin; an exhibition in Plymouth in the 1880s was less successful, and a disbelieving mob pulled the wig and hat from a \"Pig-faced Lady\" in her tent and proceeded to attack the showmen. The fate of the bear is not recorded.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=86}}\n\n==''Uncle Silas''==\nThe legend of the pig-faced woman was revived once more in 1865, in [[Sheridan Le Fanu]]'s novel ''[[Uncle Silas]]''.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=89}} ''Uncle Silas'' tells the story of Maud Ruthyn, a wealthy heiress in her late teens who lives in a secluded house, whom a number of scheming men aim to marry to secure her money.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=90}} The book includes a \"[[Barzaz Breiz|Bretagne ballad]]\" about the pig-faced woman, sung to Maud by her scheming governess Madame de la Rougierre as Rougierre leads her to a secret meeting with her cousin Dudley, who also has designs on her fortune.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=90}} (No other record of the \"Bretagne ballad\" exists, and it was almost certainly written by Le Fanu himself.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=90}}){{Quote|This lady was neither pig nor maid,<br>And so she was not of human mould;<br>Not of the living nor the dead.<br>Her left hand and foot were warm to touch;<br>Her right as cold as a corpse's flesh!<br>And she would sing like a funeral bell, with a ding-dong tune.<br>The pigs were afraid, and viewed her aloof;<br>And women feared her and stood afar.<br>She could do without sleep for a year and a day;<br>She could sleep like a corpse, for a month and more.<br>No one knew how this lady fed&nbsp;\u2013<br>On acorns or on flesh.<br>Some say that she's one of the swine-possessed,<br>That swam over the sea of Gennesaret.<br>A mongrel body and demon soul.<br>Some say she's the wife of the Wandering Jew,<br>And broke the law for the sake of pork;<br>And a swinish face for a token doth bear,<br>That her shame is now, and her punishment coming.{{sfn|Le Fanu|1864|p=72}}}}\nWhile Maud is described in the book as an attractive young woman, not a deformed monster, ''Uncle Silas'' is carefully written and plotted, and it is almost certain that Le Fanu explicitly intended a comparison between Maud's situation and the legend of the wealthy woman living in isolation and desired only for her money.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=90}} Le Fanu spent his entire life in Dublin and was editor and proprietor of the ''[[Dublin University Magazine]]'', and would certainly have been familiar with the legends of the pig-faced woman, and in particular the case of Griselda Steevens.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=90}}\n\n==Decline of the legend==\nThe 1814\u201315 Pig-faced Lady craze in London and the subsequent hoax in Paris were the last occasions in which the mainstream press reported the existence of pig-faced women as fact.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=89}} By the 1860s the fad for exhibiting \"pig-faced women\" at fairs was losing popularity,{{sfn|Dickens|1861|p=333}} although they continued to be exhibited until at least the 1880s.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=86}} Today the legend is almost forgotten.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=89}}\n\nWhile Dr Steevens' Hospital still exists, albeit now as the head office of the [[Health Service Executive]] ({{lang|ie|Feidhmeannacht na Seirbh\u00edse Sl\u00e1inte}}) rather than as a working hospital, the display of Pig-faced Lady memorabilia at the hospital had ceased by the mid-19th&nbsp;century.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=84}} The portrait commissioned by Griselda Steevens to refute the rumours about her appearance still hangs in the hospital's main hall.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=83}}\n\nThe last significant work to treat the existence of pig-faced women as fact was ''Ghosts, Helpful and Harmful'' by [[Ghost hunting|ghost hunter]] and supernatural researcher [[Elliott O'Donnell]], published in 1924.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=89}} O'Donnell alleged that the ghost of a pig-faced lady haunted a house in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]].{{sfn|O'Donnell|1924|p=229}} O'Donnell claimed that the ghost was a \"Vice Elemental, the most harmful of all the denizens of the Spirit World\".{{sfn|O'Donnell|1924|p=239}} He describes how a clergyman, \"The Rev.&nbsp;Mr&nbsp;H.\" and his family, who resided in the house, were tempted by the ghost. The ghost, keeping her face concealed, led \"The Rev.&nbsp;Mr&nbsp;H.\" into drunkenness,{{sfn|O'Donnell|1924|p=234}} and his children into cruelty towards animals,{{sfn|O'Donnell|1924|p=237}} until they themselves behaved like pigs.{{sfn|O'Donnell|1924|p=236}} She then revealed her face to the shocked family, who moved out of the house immediately.{{sfn|O'Donnell|1924|p=239}}{{quote|The body, beautifully formed, and gleaming like polished ivory in the moonbeams, resembled that of a woman, but the face was the face of some very grotesque and repulsive animal. In the place of human cheeks were huge collops of white, unwholesome fat; the nose was snoutlike, the mouth a great slit, full of hideous crooked tusks; and whilst the whole conformity of the features suggested the face of a distorted and horrible-looking pig, the animal, in contrast to the human, was made all the more poignant by the hair&nbsp;\u2013 unmistakably a woman's&nbsp;\u2013 which fell in a bright mass of rippling gold around the neck and shoulders. The children were still staring at it, in speechless horror, when their father opened the door of his room; and as he did so, the figure slowly faded away and vanished.{{sfn|O'Donnell|1924|pp=238\u2013239}}}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cultural references to pigs]]\n* [[Learned pig]]\n* [[Varahi]], a Hindu goddess with a woman's body and a pig's head\n* [[Vajrav\u0101r\u0101h\u012b]], a Buddhist deity who prominently displays a sow's head above her right ear\n* ''[[Penelope (2006 film)|Penelope]]'', a 2006 film about a woman with a pig's snout\n* \"[[Eye of the Beholder (1960 Twilight Zone episode)|Eye of the Beholder]]\", a ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|Twilight Zone]]'' episode featuring a reversal of this trope, with a normal-faced human woman among pig-faced people\n* \"[[The Bris]]\", a [[Seinfeld]] episode that involves a pig-faced man\n\n==Notes and references==\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n\n===References===\n{{Reflist|colwidth=24em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book|last=Bondeson|first=Jan|title=The Pig-Faced Lady of Manchester Square & Other Medical Marvels|year=2006|publisher=Tempus Publishing|location=Stroud|isbn=0-7524-3662-7|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Burton|first=William Evans|authorlink=William Evans Burton|date=September 1837|title=Scissibles|journal=Burton's Gentleman's Magazine|location=Philadelphia|volume=1|issue=3|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Chambers|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Chambers (publisher born 1802)|date=17 August 1850|title='Modern Myths' \u2013 The Pig-Faced Lady|journal=Chambers's Edinburgh Journal|publisher=William Chambers|location=Edinburgh|issue=346|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Chambers|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Chambers (publisher born 1802)|title=The Book of Days|volume=2|year=1864|publisher=W. & R.

The event, sponsored by a shady corporation, brings together people from high schools all over South Korea on a regional and then, national level in order to select three representatives for the World Tournament. As a prize, the winner gets his wish fulfilled by the hosting corporation, no question asked.\n\nThis intrigues Mo-Ri, and as he continues through the tournament, he meets many competitors each with a different way of fighting. Martial arts aside, participants fight by using \"Borrowed Power\" (or \"Charyeok\"in Korean), a mystical energy granted by supernatural entities (gods, demons, mythical creatures....), hence the name Borrowed Power. During the opening rounds, he comes across two other martial arts prodigies: [[Full contact karate|Full-Contact Karate]] expert Han Dae-Wi and [[Korean swordsmanship|epeeist]] master Yu Mi-Ra. These two would befriend Jin Mo-Ri after their fights with him, and will become teamed together after the preliminary rounds. As the tournaments preliminary rounds finish, and teams assemble, plans for many different people within the organization, and those pitted against them begin to make their moves to achieve their goals. \n\n=== Arcs<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://namu.wiki/w/%EA%B0%93%20%EC%98%A4%EB%B8%8C%20%ED%95%98%EC%9D%B4%EC%8A%A4%EC%BF%A8|title=Namuwiki|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> ===\n'''Arc 1: Round with Gods / (Episode 1 to 41)''' The start of the \"God of High School\" competition.\n\n'''Arc 2: National Tournament / (Episode 42 to 112)''' Depicts the battles between participants in the mid- and late national stages.\n\n'''Arc 2.5: Jin Tae-jin Story/ (Episode 113 to 118)''' Centers on Jin Tae-Jin's past during an infiltration mission in North Korea and how he adopted Mo-Ri.\n\n'''Arc 3: Adventure / (Episode 119-172)''' \n\n'''Arc 4: World Championships / (Episode 173 to 216)''' The arc feature a consolation match and introduces the character of Hui Mo-Ri.\n\n'''Arc 5: Ragnarok / (Episode 217 to 307)''' Unfolds the finals of the world tournament.

Later in the series, after the mystical \"Borrowed Power\" is introduced Mo-Ri is labeled as a Genuine Fighter meaning he uses martial arts to fight rather than borrowing power from other beings. However, the reason Mo-Ri is so powerful is due to his true identity of the mythical [[Sun Wukong]], inspired by the Ancient Chinese Novel [[Journey to the West]] much like [[Goku]] from the [[Dragon Ball]] [[manga]] series.\n\n'''Han Dae-Wi:''' a 17-year-old martial artist from Seoul, South Korea who practices [[Kyokushin]] [[Karate]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-god-of-high-school/ep-6/viewer?title_no=66&episode_no=6|title=The God of High School - Ep. 6|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref> He was taught the fighting style by the creator of the art himself [[Mas Oyama]]. Dae-Wi starts off the series as a hard-working young man who works to pay off his best friend's hospital bill due to terminal cancer. After being invited to the GOH tournament, Dae-Wi participates to cure his friend of the disease. His Borrowed Power is that of a [[Xiezhi|Haetae]], a mythical creature with the ability to control water as a defensive tool or a weapon as well as augmenting attacks.\n\n'''Yu Mi-Ra:''' a 17-year-old swordswoman from Seoul, South Korea and the 25th master of a fictitious sword style called the Moonlight Sword, (Korean: \uc6d4\uac15\ub3c4)<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-god-of-high-school/ep-6/viewer?title_no=66&episode_no=6|title=The God of High School - Ep. 6|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref> which emphasizes strong yet fluid attacks. She initially joins the GOH Tournament in order to fulfill her wish of finding a suitable husband to carry on the school bloodline. Mira's borrowed power is of an Ancient Chinese general named [[L\u00fc Bu]], which is loosely based on the historical figure of the same name. This power gives her several abilities such as enhanced strength and the ability to summon a red horse.\n\n=== GOH competitors ===\n'''Park Il-Pyo:''' a 18-year-old boy competing in the God of High School tournament. He is introduced as a cold and calculating fighter who uses a fictional version of the traditional Korean martial art of [[Taekkyeon|Taekkyon]] (\ud0dc\uaef8) called Ssamsu-Taekkyon (Korean: \uc308\uc218\ud0dd\uacac).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-god-of-high-school/ep-58/viewer?title_no=66&episode_no=58|title=The God of High School - Ep. 58|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref> He competes alongside his cousin and fellow Taekkyon practitioner '''Park Seung-Ah''' in order to cure their relative Park Seung-Min who was crippled by Taek Jae-Kal. Il-Pyo later acts as an ally to Jin Mo-Ri and helps him through many hardships in the series. His Charyok is [[Kumiho]], the nine-tail fox of Eastern Asian folklore.\n\n'''Baek Seung-Cheol:''' a 18-year-old participant in the God of High School tournament who uses a metal [[baseball bat]] as a weapon. Seung-Cheol is of genius-level intellect and peak physical conditioning capable of predicting an opponent's movements and suddenly changing the direction of his swing. This makes his fighting style unorthodox and unpredictable for those he is fighting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-god-of-high-school/ep-17/viewer?title_no=66&episode_no=17|title=The God of High School - Ep. 17|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref> Later on in the series, Seung-Cheol gains the favor of the Oxen King and she becomes his borrowed power giving him increased strength, speed, and durability. The character of the Oxen King is a combination of characters from Journey to the West: Bull King and his wife [[Princess Iron Fan]].\n\n'''Taek Jae-Kal:''' main antagonist of the first and second arcs. Sold off as a baby by his mother to become the heir of the chairman of a large company, he grew up with a <nowiki>''</nowiki>Might is right<nowiki>''</nowiki> philosophy. Dubbed a monster by his opponents and team mates alike, Jae-Kal has an arrogant personality and extremely violent style of fighting, viewing everyone around him as insignificant trash. The exception being the guardian of Ssamsu-Taekkyon, Park Il-Pyo, his mortal enemy who was the only person to defeat him years prior to the GOH tournament. Jae-Kal's Charyeok is characterized by \"Greed\", allowing him to absorb other fighter's powers.  \n\n=== THE SIX ===\nAlso known as \"human cultural assets\" (cor: \uc778\uac04\ubb38\ud654\uc7ac) THE SIX are a group of people who are the highest level masters of their own fighting styles. They would gather every ten years to fight among themselves to get the title of \"special human cultural asset\" (aka the \"best fighter\"). \n\n'''Park Mu-Bong/Jin:''' main antagonist of the manhwa. Member of the Six and [[National Assembly (South Korea)|National Assembly of Korea]], he is the figure in charge of the God of High School tournament in South Korea. In the series, he acts as a mastermind by laying out plans to achieve his goal of obtaining power. His borrowed power is called \"Longinus' Hand\" which manifests as two yellow crosses appearing on each of Mu-Jin's hands. The name Longinus' Hand is loosely based on [[Longinus]] the Roman soldier said to have pierced the side of [[Jesus]] during the [[Crucifixion]], hence the crosses on the character's hands. Longinus' Hand allows him control over gravity and as a defensive shield.\n\n=== Others ===\n'''Jin Tae-Jin:''' the adoptive grandfather of series protagonist Jin Mo-Ri, and the man who taught Mo-Ri his specialty of Re-Taekwondo. Probably the strongest martial artist of the series, Tae-Jin is the creator and only master of the fictional Renewal Taekwondo. Also known as the <nowiki>''</nowiki>God of combat<nowiki>''</nowiki>, Tae-Jin defeated <nowiki>''</nowiki>The Six<nowiki>''</nowiki> without even resorting to borrowed power. As the captain of an elite group of soldiers sent on a mission to infiltrate [[North Korea]], he found an infant Mo-Ri encased within a transparent green shell and guarded by a giant bipedal ape-like humanoid. Being the only survivor of the mission, Tae-Jin returned home and raised Mo-Ri as his own family.\n\n== Fighting techniques ==\n\n'''Charyeok:''' (kor:\ucc28\ub825; hanja:\u501f\u529b; lit. \"''Borrowed Power''\"),Within the God of High School webtoon, humans are capable of making contracts with gods and other divine beings to borrow a piece of their power to enhance themselves physically and gain supernatural powers. Each divine or otherworldly lending different powers to their contractors or descendants, one example within the comic is Thor who gives his contractor Anna the ability to fly, superhuman strength, and speed. A select few individuals are allowed to make a \"Direct Contract\" with their divine being, lending the human more power and sometimes an item originally used by said figure.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://godofhighschool.fandom.com/wiki/Charyeok|title=GOH fandom/Charyeok|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n'''Martial Arts:''' (kor: \ubb34\ud22c; hanja \u6b66\u95d8; lit. \"''Mutu''\"), Martial arts are codified systems of human combat practices for self-defence, competition, health and physical fitness, entertainment, as well as for mental, physical and spiritual development...Unlike the Charyeok, which borrows the capacities of a supernatural entity, martial arts rely entirely on the physical, mental and technical skills of their user. The Manhwa gives prominence to martial arts, some of which are inspired by real-life styles.\n\n'''National Treasures''' are items from human history endowed with tremendous power. There are different types of National Treasures and, as such, they each have a different appearance. Some of the treasures are even capable of changing their forms. These weapons range from swords to bats, knives, guns, even rocket launchers. National treasures can be given by gods the Power Borrower commune or made by artisans. All national treasures have the ability to chose its owner and grant him with a multitude of other abilities such as Teleportation, Levitation, Attack Enhancement, Charyeok Amplification....they each have a will of their own and chooses a master who is most worthy of them. \n\n== Setting ==\nIn GOH, the action takes place and involves the inhabitants of three different realms<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://godofhighschool.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Locations|title=GOH fandom/ information about locations|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>:\n\n'''The Human Realm:''' mainly populated by humans and identical to our known world.

It is populated by various mythical creatures, spirits, and monsters who are collectively known as Demons. In the hierarchy of worlds, it is higher than the Human Realm but lower than the Heavenly Realm. Nearly one thousand years ago, the Sage Realm and the Heavenly Realm had a war, which the Sage Realm lost.\n\n'''The''' '''Heavenly Realm''' (kor: \uc2e0\uacc4; hanja: \u795e\u754c,  lit. \"''Divine World''\").

The event, sponsored by a shady corporation, brings together people from high schools all over South Korea on a regional and then, national level in order to select three representatives for the World Tournament. As a prize, the winner gets his wish fulfilled by the hosting corporation, no question asked.\n\nThis intrigues Mo-Ri, and as he continues through the tournament, he meets many competitors each with a different way of fighting. Martial arts aside, participants fight by using \"Borrowed Power\" (or \"Charyeok\"in Korean), a mystical energy granted by supernatural entities (gods, demons, mythical creatures....), hence the name Borrowed Power. During the opening rounds, he comes across two other martial arts prodigies: [[Full contact karate|Full-Contact Karate]] expert Han Dae-Wi and [[Korean swordsmanship|epeeist]] master Yu Mi-Ra. These two would befriend Jin Mo-Ri after their fights with him, and will become teamed together after the preliminary rounds. As the tournaments preliminary rounds finish, and teams assemble, plans for many different people within the organization, and those pitted against them begin to make their moves to achieve their goals. \n\n=== Arcs<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://namu.wiki/w/%EA%B0%93%20%EC%98%A4%EB%B8%8C%20%ED%95%98%EC%9D%B4%EC%8A%A4%EC%BF%A8|title=Namuwiki|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> ===\n'''Arc 1: Round with Gods / (Episode 1 to 41)''' The start of the \"God of High School\" competition.\n\n'''Arc 2: National Tournament / (Episode 42 to 112)''' Depicts the battles between participants in the mid- and late national stages.\n\n'''Arc 2.5: Jin Tae-jin Story/ (Episode 113 to 118)''' Centers on Jin Tae-Jin's past during an infiltration mission in North Korea and how he adopted Mo-Ri.\n\n'''Arc 3: Adventure / (Episode 119-172)''' \n\n'''Arc 4: World Championships / (Episode 173 to 216)''' The arc feature a consolation match and introduces the character of Hui Mo-Ri.\n\n'''Arc 5: Ragnarok / (Episode 217 to 307)''' Unfolds the finals of the world tournament.

Later in the series, after the mystical \"Borrowed Power\" is introduced Mo-Ri is labeled as a Genuine Fighter meaning he uses martial arts to fight rather than borrowing power from other beings. However, the reason Mo-Ri is so powerful is due to his true identity of the mythical [[Sun Wukong]], inspired by the Ancient Chinese Novel [[Journey to the West]] much like [[Goku]] from the [[Dragon Ball]] [[manga]] series.\n\n'''Han Dae-Wi:''' a 17-year-old martial artist from Seoul, South Korea who practices [[Kyokushin]] [[Karate]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-god-of-high-school/ep-6/viewer?title_no=66&episode_no=6|title=The God of High School - Ep. 6|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref> He was taught the fighting style by the creator of the art himself [[Mas Oyama]]. Dae-Wi starts off the series as a hard-working young man who works to pay off his best friend's hospital bill due to terminal cancer. After being invited to the GOH tournament, Dae-Wi participates to cure his friend of the disease. His Borrowed Power is that of a [[Xiezhi|Haetae]], a mythical creature with the ability to control water as a defensive tool or a weapon as well as augmenting attacks.\n\n'''Yu Mi-Ra:''' a 17-year-old swordswoman from Seoul, South Korea and the 25th master of a fictitious sword style called the Moonlight Sword, (Korean: \uc6d4\uac15\ub3c4)<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-god-of-high-school/ep-6/viewer?title_no=66&episode_no=6|title=The God of High School - Ep. 6|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref> which emphasizes strong yet fluid attacks. She initially joins the GOH Tournament in order to fulfill her wish of finding a suitable husband to carry on the school bloodline. Mira's borrowed power is of an Ancient Chinese general named [[L\u00fc Bu]], which is loosely based on the historical figure of the same name. This power gives her several abilities such as enhanced strength and the ability to summon a red horse.\n\n=== GOH competitors ===\n'''Park Il-Pyo:''' a 18-year-old boy competing in the God of High School tournament. He is introduced as a cold and calculating fighter who uses a fictional version of the traditional Korean martial art of [[Taekkyeon|Taekkyon]] (\ud0dc\uaef8) called Ssamsu-Taekkyon (Korean: \uc308\uc218\ud0dd\uacac).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-god-of-high-school/ep-58/viewer?title_no=66&episode_no=58|title=The God of High School - Ep. 58|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref> He competes alongside his cousin and fellow Taekkyon practitioner '''Park Seung-Ah''' in order to cure their relative Park Seung-Min who was crippled by Taek Jae-Kal. Il-Pyo later acts as an ally to Jin Mo-Ri and helps him through many hardships in the series. His Charyok is [[Kumiho]], the nine-tail fox of Eastern Asian folklore.\n\n'''Baek Seung-Cheol:''' a 18-year-old participant in the God of High School tournament who uses a metal [[baseball bat]] as a weapon. Seung-Cheol is of genius-level intellect and peak physical conditioning capable of predicting an opponent's movements and suddenly changing the direction of his swing. This makes his fighting style unorthodox and unpredictable for those he is fighting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-god-of-high-school/ep-17/viewer?title_no=66&episode_no=17|title=The God of High School - Ep. 17|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref> Later on in the series, Seung-Cheol gains the favor of the Oxen King and she becomes his borrowed power giving him increased strength, speed, and durability. The character of the Oxen King is a combination of characters from Journey to the West: Bull King and his wife [[Princess Iron Fan]].\n\n'''Taek Jae-Kal:''' main antagonist of the first and second arcs. Sold off as a baby by his mother to become the heir of the chairman of a large company, he grew up with a <nowiki>''</nowiki>Might is right<nowiki>''</nowiki> philosophy. Dubbed a monster by his opponents and team mates alike, Jae-Kal has an arrogant personality and extremely violent style of fighting, viewing everyone around him as insignificant trash. The exception being the guardian of Ssamsu-Taekkyon, Park Il-Pyo, his mortal enemy who was the only person to defeat him years prior to the GOH tournament. Jae-Kal's Charyeok is characterized by \"Greed\", allowing him to absorb other fighter's powers.  \n\n=== THE SIX ===\nAlso known as \"human cultural assets\" (cor: \uc778\uac04\ubb38\ud654\uc7ac) THE SIX are a group of people who are the highest level masters of their own fighting styles. They would gather every ten years to fight among themselves to get the title of \"special human cultural asset\" (aka the \"best fighter\"). \n\n'''Park Mu-Bong/Jin:''' main antagonist of the manhwa. Member of the Six and [[National Assembly (South Korea)|National Assembly of Korea]], he is the figure in charge of the God of High School tournament in South Korea. In the series, he acts as a mastermind by laying out plans to achieve his goal of obtaining power. His borrowed power is called \"Longinus' Hand\" which manifests as two yellow crosses appearing on each of Mu-Jin's hands. The name Longinus' Hand is loosely based on [[Longinus]] the Roman soldier said to have pierced the side of [[Jesus]] during the [[Crucifixion]], hence the crosses on the character's hands. Longinus' Hand allows him control over gravity and as a defensive shield.\n\n=== Others ===\n'''Jin Tae-Jin:''' the adoptive grandfather of series protagonist Jin Mo-Ri, and the man who taught Mo-Ri his specialty of Re-Taekwondo. Probably the strongest martial artist of the series, Tae-Jin is the creator and only master of the fictional Renewal Taekwondo. Also known as the <nowiki>''</nowiki>God of combat<nowiki>''</nowiki>, Tae-Jin defeated <nowiki>''</nowiki>The Six<nowiki>''</nowiki> without even resorting to borrowed power. As the captain of an elite group of soldiers sent on a mission to infiltrate [[North Korea]], he found an infant Mo-Ri encased within a transparent green shell and guarded by a giant bipedal ape-like humanoid. Being the only survivor of the mission, Tae-Jin returned home and raised Mo-Ri as his own family.\n\n== Fighting techniques ==\n\n'''Charyeok:''' (kor:\ucc28\ub825; hanja:\u501f\u529b; lit. \"''Borrowed Power''\"),Within the God of High School webtoon, humans are capable of making contracts with gods and other divine beings to borrow a piece of their power to enhance themselves physically and gain supernatural powers. Each divine or otherworldly lending different powers to their contractors or descendants, one example within the comic is Thor who gives his contractor Anna the ability to fly, superhuman strength, and speed. A select few individuals are allowed to make a \"Direct Contract\" with their divine being, lending the human more power and sometimes an item originally used by said figure.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://godofhighschool.fandom.com/wiki/Charyeok|title=GOH fandom/Charyeok|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n'''Martial Arts:''' (kor: \ubb34\ud22c; hanja \u6b66\u95d8; lit. \"''Mutu''\"), Martial arts are codified systems of human combat practices for self-defence, competition, health and physical fitness, entertainment, as well as for mental, physical and spiritual development...Unlike the Charyeok, which borrows the capacities of a supernatural entity, martial arts rely entirely on the physical, mental and technical skills of their user. The Manhwa gives prominence to martial arts, some of which are inspired by real-life styles.\n\n'''National Treasures''' are items from human history endowed with tremendous power. There are different types of National Treasures and, as such, they each have a different appearance. Some of the treasures are even capable of changing their forms. These weapons range from swords to bats, knives, guns, even rocket launchers. National treasures can be given by gods the Power Borrower commune or made by artisans. All national treasures have the ability to chose its owner and grant him with a multitude of other abilities such as Teleportation, Levitation, Attack Enhancement, Charyeok Amplification....they each have a will of their own and chooses a master who is most worthy of them. \n\n== Setting ==\nIn GOH, the action takes place and involves the inhabitants of three different realms<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://godofhighschool.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Locations|title=GOH fandom/ information about locations|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>:\n\n'''The Human Realm:''' mainly populated by humans and identical to our known world.

It is populated by various mythical creatures, spirits, and monsters who are collectively known as Demons. In the hierarchy of worlds, it is higher than the Human Realm but lower than the Heavenly Realm. Nearly one thousand years ago, the Sage Realm and the Heavenly Realm had a war, which the Sage Realm lost.\n\n'''The''' '''Heavenly Realm''' (kor: \uc2e0\uacc4; hanja: \u795e\u754c,  lit. \"''Divine World''\").

He was enrolled at a naval school, but quit his studies to go to New York, where he mingled with the [[Bonapartist]]s in exile.

In 1828, King [[Charles X of France|Charles X]] commissioned him to paint a depiction of Ensign {{ill|Hippolyte Bisson|fr}} who, the year before, had blown up his ship rather than surrender it to pirates. Shortly after, Gudin went with his friend, [[Abel Aubert Dupetit Thouars]], to participate in the [[French conquest of Algeria|Algerian Expedition]], where he made numerous sketches. \n\nUpon his return, he was named a \"Peintre de la Marine\" at the court of Louis Philippe. Over the next few years, he made painting trips to Italy, Switzerland and Russia.

In 1828, King [[Charles X of France|Charles X]] commissioned him to paint a depiction of Ensign {{ill|Hippolyte Bisson|fr}} who, the year before, had blown up his ship rather than surrender it to pirates. Shortly after, Gudin went with his friend, [[Abel Aubert Dupetit Thouars]], to participate in the [[French conquest of Algeria|Algerian Expedition]], where he made numerous sketches. \n\nUpon his return, he was named a \"Peintre de la Marine\" at the court of Louis Philippe. Over the next few years, he made painting trips to Italy, Switzerland and Russia. He was then created a Baron by the King and commissioned to produce ninety paintings on French naval history for the [[Palace of Versailles]], a monumental task that apparently undermined his health.\n\nHe was named an officer in the [[Legion of Honor]] in 1841<ref name=\"LH\"/>.

Becoming pregnant disqualified her from a residency in pediatrics, so she took one in psychiatry. After suffering two miscarriages, she had a son, [[Ken Ross (photographer)|Kenneth]], and a daughter, Barbara, in the early 1960s.<ref>[http://www.deathreference.com/Ke-Ma/K-bler-Ross-Elisabeth.html K\u00fcbler-Ross, Elisabeth<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Her husband requested a divorce in 1979.\n\n==Academic career==\nK\u00fcbler-Ross moved to New York in 1958 to work and continued her studies.\n\nShe began her psychiatric residency in the [[Manhattan Psychiatric Center|Manhattan State Hospital]] in the early 1960's, she began her career working to create treatment for those who were schizophrenic along with those faced with the title \"hopeless patient\". These treatment programs would work to restore the patient's sense of dignity and self-respect. Elisabeth also intended to reduce the medications that kept these patients overly sedated, and found ways to help them relate to the outside world<ref name=\":1\" />  During her time at the hospital, she realized how appalling the treatments of the imminently dying patients were. This realization made her strive to make a difference in the lives of these individuals.\n\nIn 1962, she accepted a position at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]] School of Medicine. There, Elisabeth was a junior faculty member and gave her first interview of a young terminally ill woman in front of a roomful of medical students. Her intentions were not to be an example of pathology, but K\u00fcbler-Ross wanted to depict a human being who desired to be understood as she was coping with her illness and how it has impacted her life. <ref name=\":1\" /> She states to her students,<blockquote>\"Now you are reacting like human beings instead of scientists. Maybe now you'll not only know how a dying patient feels but you will also be able to treat them with compassion the same compassion that you would want for yourself\"<ref name=\":1\" /></blockquote>K\u00fcbler-Ross completed her training in psychiatry in 1963, and then moved to Chicago in 1965. She sometimes questioned the practices of traditional [[psychiatry]] that she observed. She also undertook 39 months of classical [[psychoanalysis]] training in Chicago. She became an instructor at the [[University of Chicago]]'s [[Pritzker School of Medicine]] where she began to conduct a regular weekly educational seminar that consisted of live interviews with terminally ill patients. She had her students participate in these despite a large amount of resistance from the medical staff.<ref name=\":1\" />.\n\nA Life magazine ran an article on K\u00fcbler-Ross in November 1969, bringing public awareness to her work outside of the medical community. The response was enormous and influenced K\u00fcbler-Ross\u2019s decision to focus on her career on working with the terminally ill and their families. The intense scrutiny her work received also had an impact on her career path. K\u00fcbler-Ross stopped teaching at the university to work privately on what she called the \u201cgreatest mystery in science\u201d\u2014death.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.biography.com/scientist/elisabeth-kubler-ross}}</ref>\n\n==Healing Center==\nK\u00fcbler-Ross encouraged the [[hospice care]] movement, believing that [[euthanasia]] prevents people from completing their 'unfinished business'{{citation needed|reason=No reference provided|date=November 2014}}.\n\nIn 1977 she persuaded her husband to buy forty acres of land in [[Escondido, California]], near San Diego, where she founded \"[[Shanti Nilaya]]\" (Home of Peace). She intended it as a healing center for the dying and their families. She was also a co-founder of the [[American Holistic Medical Association]].\n\nIn the late 1970s, she became interested in [[out-of-body experiences]], [[mediumship]], [[spiritualism]], and other ways of attempting to contact the dead. This led to a scandal connected to the Shanti Nilaya Healing Center, in which she was duped by [[Jay Barham]], founder of the Church of the Facet of the Divinity. Claiming he could [[channeling (mediumistic)|channel]] the spirits of the departed and summon ethereal \"entities\", he encouraged church members to engage in sexual relations with the \"spirits\". He may have hired several women to play the parts of female spirits for this purpose.<ref>[http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20074920,00.html Sex, Visitors from the Grave, Psychic Healing: Kubler-Ross Is a Public Storm Center Again] by Karen G.

This was inspired by the aid-project of British doctor [[Cicely Saunders]]. Elisabeth attempted to do this in 1985 in Virginia, but local residents feared the possibility of infection and blocked the necessary re-zoning. In 1994, she lost her house and possessions to an arson fire that is suspected to have been set by opponents of her AIDS work.<ref>[http://www.kinofenster.de/filmeundthemen/neuimkino/archiv_neuimkino/elisabeth_kueblerross_dem_tod_ins_gesicht_sehen_film/ Kinofenster.de] {{in lang|de}}</ref>\n\nShe conducted many workshops on [[AIDS]] in different parts of the world. In 1990, she moved the Healing Center to her own farm in [[Head Waters, Virginia]], to reduce her extensive traveling.\n\n==Death==\nK\u00fcbler-Ross suffered a series of strokes in 1995 which left her partially paralyzed on her left side, in the meantime Shanti Nilaya Healing Center closed.

She went to the university of Zurich to study medicine and graduated in 1957.\n\nDuring World War II she worked with refugees, in [[Z\u00fcrich]], and following the war, did relief work in Poland. She would later visit [[Majdanek concentration camp|Maidanek]] death camp which sparked her interest in the power of compassion and resilience of the human spirit.

Becoming pregnant disqualified her from a residency in pediatrics, so she took one in psychiatry. After suffering two miscarriages, she had a son, [[Ken Ross (photographer)|Kenneth]], and a daughter, Barbara, in the early 1960s.<ref>[http://www.deathreference.com/Ke-Ma/K-bler-Ross-Elisabeth.html K\u00fcbler-Ross, Elisabeth<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Her husband requested a divorce in 1979.\n\n==Academic career==\nK\u00fcbler-Ross moved to New York in 1958 to work and continued her studies.\n\nShe began her psychiatric residency in the [[Manhattan Psychiatric Center|Manhattan State Hospital]] in the early 1960's, she began her career working to create treatment for those who were schizophrenic along with those faced with the title \"hopeless patient\". These treatment programs would work to restore the patient's sense of dignity and self-respect. Elisabeth also intended to reduce the medications that kept these patients overly sedated, and found ways to help them relate to the outside world<ref name=\":1\" />  During her time at the hospital, she realized how appalling the treatments of the imminently dying patients were. This realization made her strive to make a difference in the lives of these individuals.\n\nIn 1962, she accepted a position at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]] School of Medicine. There, Elisabeth was a junior faculty member and gave her first interview of a young terminally ill woman in front of a roomful of medical students. Her intentions were not to be an example of pathology, but K\u00fcbler-Ross wanted to depict a human being who desired to be understood as she was coping with her illness and how it has impacted her life. <ref name=\":1\" /> She states to her students,<blockquote>\"Now you are reacting like human beings instead of scientists. Maybe now you'll not only know how a dying patient feels but you will also be able to treat them with compassion the same compassion that you would want for yourself\"<ref name=\":1\" /></blockquote>K\u00fcbler-Ross completed her training in psychiatry in 1963, and then moved to Chicago in 1965. She sometimes questioned the practices of traditional [[psychiatry]] that she observed. She also undertook 39 months of classical [[psychoanalysis]] training in Chicago. She became an instructor at the [[University of Chicago]]'s [[Pritzker School of Medicine]] where she began to conduct a regular weekly educational seminar that consisted of live interviews with terminally ill patients. She had her students participate in these despite a large amount of resistance from the medical staff.<ref name=\":1\" />.\n\nA Life magazine ran an article on K\u00fcbler-Ross in November 1969, bringing public awareness to her work outside of the medical community. The response was enormous and influenced K\u00fcbler-Ross\u2019s decision to focus on her career on working with the terminally ill and their families. The intense scrutiny her work received also had an impact on her career path. K\u00fcbler-Ross stopped teaching at the university to work privately on what she called the \u201cgreatest mystery in science\u201d\u2014death.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.biography.com/scientist/elisabeth-kubler-ross}}</ref>\n\n==Healing Center==\nK\u00fcbler-Ross encouraged the [[hospice care]] movement, believing that [[euthanasia]] prevents people from completing their 'unfinished business'{{citation needed|reason=No reference provided|date=November 2014}}.\n\nIn 1977 she persuaded her husband to buy forty acres of land in [[Escondido, California]], near San Diego, where she founded \"[[Shanti Nilaya]]\" (Home of Peace). She intended it as a healing center for the dying and their families. She was also a co-founder of the [[American Holistic Medical Association]].\n\nIn the late 1970s, she became interested in [[out-of-body experiences]], [[mediumship]], [[spiritualism]], and other ways of attempting to contact the dead. This led to a scandal connected to the Shanti Nilaya Healing Center, in which she was duped by [[Jay Barham]], founder of the Church of the Facet of the Divinity. Claiming he could [[channeling (mediumistic)|channel]] the spirits of the departed and summon ethereal \"entities\", he encouraged church members to engage in sexual relations with the \"spirits\". He may have hired several women to play the parts of female spirits for this purpose.<ref>[http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20074920,00.html Sex, Visitors from the Grave, Psychic Healing: Kubler-Ross Is a Public Storm Center Again] by Karen G.

This was inspired by the aid-project of British doctor [[Cicely Saunders]]. Elisabeth attempted to do this in 1985 in Virginia, but local residents feared the possibility of infection and blocked the necessary re-zoning. In 1994, she lost her house and possessions to an arson fire that is suspected to have been set by opponents of her AIDS work.<ref>[http://www.kinofenster.de/filmeundthemen/neuimkino/archiv_neuimkino/elisabeth_kueblerross_dem_tod_ins_gesicht_sehen_film/ Kinofenster.de] {{in lang|de}}</ref>\n\nShe conducted many workshops on [[AIDS]] in different parts of the world. In 1990, she moved the Healing Center to her own farm in [[Head Waters, Virginia]], to reduce her extensive traveling.\n\n==Death==\nK\u00fcbler-Ross suffered a series of strokes in 1995 which left her partially paralyzed on her left side, in the meantime Shanti Nilaya Healing Center closed. She found herself living in a wheelchair, slowly waiting for death to come, and wished to be able to determine her time of death.<ref>Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, On life After Death, Foreword by Caroline Myss p.vii.

Gifts are not exclusive to romantic relationships; women exchange gifts most frequently between one another and will occasionally give male co-workers chocolate, although this latter exchange is often referred to as an obligation gift.

It ranks Britain's 100 private companies with the fastest-growing sales over the last three years. It is published in [[The Sunday Times]] each December, with a conference and awards event typically held in May<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/sunday-times-virgin-atlantic-fast-track-100-awards-qtqtr63nf|title=Sunday Times Virgin Atlantic Fast Track 100 awards|date=19 May 2019|work=The Sunday Times|access-date=16 April 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>, and alumni dinners during the year. The list is researched and produced by Fast Track, an Oxford-based research and networking events business<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fasttrack.co.uk/about-us/|title=Fast Track Ltd|website=Fast Track|access-date=16 April 2020}}</ref>. Sir Richard Brandon and the [[Virgin Group]] have supported the Fast Track 100 league table since Hamish Stevenson founded Fast Track in 1996.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/entrepreneurs-are-lifeblood-uk-business|title=Entrepreneurs are the lifeblood of UK business|date=2018-12-17|website=Virgin|language=en|access-date=2019-02-02}}</ref>\n\n== Limitations ==\nThe Fast Track 100 is generally promoted as the definitive guide to the fastest growing privately held companies in the UK. [[Richard Branson]] is quoted as saying ''\"Fast Track has become the definitive barometer of growth companies\"'' However a number of limitations exists which mean that the list may not contain information on many fast growing companies.  Most important of these is the reliance on historical data.  Because Fast Track only deals in publicly available information generally from published accounts, the league table refers to data that is sometimes as much as 10 months out of date.\n\nOn the other hand, this method ensures objectivity and has led to the early identification of a number of household names, including [[Carphone Warehouse]], [[British Home Stores]] and [[Travelex]].\n\n== Entry criteria ==\nFor entry to the 2013 Fast Track 100 companies were required to be:\n\n* Unquoted\n* Registered in the UK\n* Non-subsidiary, independent\n* 10 or more employees\n* Annualised sales of at least \u00a3250,000 in 2009/10\n* Annualised sales of at least \u00a35m in 2012/13\n* An increase in sales from penultimate to latest year, and a forecast of further sales growth\n* Not a technology company\n\n== Other Fast Track lists ==\nFast Track 100 is one of seven business lists of private companies produced by Fast Track and published in the Sunday Times:\n* Fast Track 100 - Fastest growth in sales\n* [[Tech Track 100]] - Fastest growth in sales for 'tech' companies\n* International Track 200 - Fastest growth in overseas sales\n* [[Profit Track 100]] - Fastest growth in profits\n* [[Top Track 100]]- Biggest private companies based on sales\n* [[Top Track 250]] - Leading mid-market private companies\n\n== 2018 Fast Track 100 list ==\n<br />\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+2018 Top 20 Rankings\n!Ranking\n!Company name\n!Business Activity\n!Sales growth (% per annum over 3 years)\n|-\n|1\n|Midwinter Solutions\n|Clinical trials supplier\n|233.29%\n|-\n|2\n|[[Crep Protect]]\n|Footwear accessories developer\n|190.74%\n|-\n|3\n|Revolution Beauty\n|Beauty products retailer\n|152.92%\n|-\n|4\n|Missoma\n|Online jewellery brand\n|148.26%\n|-\n|5\n|Mission Mars\n|Bar and restaurant operator\n|147.37%\n|-\n|6\n|Warner Edwards\n|Gin distiller\n|142.58%\n|-\n|7\n|One Retail Group\n|Consumer products retailer\n|141.53%\n|-\n|8\n|AerFin\n|Aircraft and spares services\n|140.68%\n|-\n|9\n|[[A.F.C.

It ranks Britain's 100 private companies with the fastest-growing sales over the last three years. It is published in [[The Sunday Times]] each December, with a conference and awards event typically held in May<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/sunday-times-virgin-atlantic-fast-track-100-awards-qtqtr63nf|title=Sunday Times Virgin Atlantic Fast Track 100 awards|date=19 May 2019|work=The Sunday Times|access-date=16 April 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>, and alumni dinners during the year. The list is researched and produced by Fast Track, an Oxford-based research and networking events business. Sir Richard Brandon and the [[Virgin Group]] have supported the Fast Track 100 league table since Hamish Stevenson founded Fast Track in 1996.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/entrepreneurs-are-lifeblood-uk-business|title=Entrepreneurs are the lifeblood of UK business|date=2018-12-17|website=Virgin|language=en|access-date=2019-02-02}}</ref>\n\n== Limitations ==\nThe Fast Track 100 is generally promoted as the definitive guide to the fastest growing privately held companies in the UK. [[Richard Branson]] is quoted as saying ''\"Fast Track has become the definitive barometer of growth companies\"'' However a number of limitations exists which mean that the list may not contain information on many fast growing companies.  Most important of these is the reliance on historical data.  Because Fast Track only deals in publicly available information generally from published accounts, the league table refers to data that is sometimes as much as 10 months out of date.\n\nOn the other hand, this method ensures objectivity and has led to the early identification of a number of household names, including [[Carphone Warehouse]], [[British Home Stores]] and [[Travelex]].\n\n== Entry criteria ==\nFor entry to the 2013 Fast Track 100 companies were required to be:\n\n* Unquoted\n* Registered in the UK\n* Non-subsidiary, independent\n* 10 or more employees\n* Annualised sales of at least \u00a3250,000 in 2009/10\n* Annualised sales of at least \u00a35m in 2012/13\n* An increase in sales from penultimate to latest year, and a forecast of further sales growth\n* Not a technology company\n\n== Other Fast Track lists ==\nFast Track 100 is one of seven business lists of private companies produced by Fast Track and published in the Sunday Times:\n* Fast Track 100 - Fastest growth in sales\n* [[Tech Track 100]] - Fastest growth in sales for 'tech' companies\n* International Track 200 - Fastest growth in overseas sales\n* [[Profit Track 100]] - Fastest growth in profits\n* [[Top Track 100]]- Biggest private companies based on sales\n* [[Top Track 250]] - Leading mid-market private companies\n\n== 2018 Fast Track 100 list ==\n<br />\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+2018 Top 20 Rankings\n!Ranking\n!Company name\n!Business Activity\n!Sales growth (% per annum over 3 years)\n|-\n|1\n|Midwinter Solutions\n|Clinical trials supplier\n|233.29%\n|-\n|2\n|[[Crep Protect]]\n|Footwear accessories developer\n|190.74%\n|-\n|3\n|Revolution Beauty\n|Beauty products retailer\n|152.92%\n|-\n|4\n|Missoma\n|Online jewellery brand\n|148.26%\n|-\n|5\n|Mission Mars\n|Bar and restaurant operator\n|147.37%\n|-\n|6\n|Warner Edwards\n|Gin distiller\n|142.58%\n|-\n|7\n|One Retail Group\n|Consumer products retailer\n|141.53%\n|-\n|8\n|AerFin\n|Aircraft and spares services\n|140.68%\n|-\n|9\n|[[A.F.C.
