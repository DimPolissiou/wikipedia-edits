In Michigan, it is a [[Michigan State Trunkline Highway System|state trunkline highway]] that enters the state south of [[New Buffalo, Michigan|New Buffalo]] and runs eastward through several metropolitan areas in the southern section of the state. The highway serves [[Benton Harbor, Michigan|Benton Harbor]]\u2013[[St. Joseph, Michigan|St. Joseph]] near [[Lake Michigan]] before turning inland toward [[Kalamazoo, Michigan|Kalamazoo]] and [[Battle Creek, Michigan|Battle Creek]] on the west side of the peninsula. Heading farther east, I-94 passes through rural areas in the middle of the southern Lower Peninsula, crossing [[Interstate 69 in Michigan|I-69]] in the process. I-94 then runs through [[Jackson, Michigan|Jackson]], [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]], and portions of [[Metro Detroit]], connecting Michigan's largest city to its [[Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport|main airport]]. Past the east side of [[Detroit]], the Interstate angles northeasterly through farmlands in [[The Thumb]] to [[Port Huron, Michigan|Port Huron]], where the designation terminates on the [[Blue Water Bridge]] at the [[Canada\u2013United States border|Canadian border]].\n\nThe first segment of what later became I-94 within the state, the Willow Run Expressway, was built near [[Ypsilanti, Michigan|Ypsilanti]] and [[Belleville, Michigan|Belleville]] in 1941, with an easterly extension to Detroit in 1945. This expressway was initially numbered '''M-112'''. In the mid-1950s, state and federal officials planned an Interstate to replace the original route of [[U.S. Route 12 in Michigan|U.S. Highway&nbsp;12]] (US&nbsp;12). By 1960, the length of I-94 was completed from Detroit to New Buffalo. Two years later, the US&nbsp;12 designation was dropped from the freeway. Subsequent extensions in the 1960s completed most of the rest of the route, including the remaining sections between Detroit and Port Huron which superseded the routing of [[U.S. Route 25 in Michigan|US&nbsp;25]]. The last segment opened to the public in 1972 when Indiana completed its connection across the state line. Since completion, I-94 has remained relatively unchanged; a few interchanges have been rebuilt, a second span was constructed for the Blue Water Bridge, and in 1987, [[Northwest Airlines Flight 255|a plane crashed]] on the freeway during takeoff from the airport in Detroit. The routing of I-94 is notable for containing the [[Ford\u2013Lodge interchange|first full freeway-to-freeway interchange in the United States]], connecting to the Lodge Freeway ([[M-10 (Michigan highway)|M-10]]), and for comprising the first complete border-to-border toll-free freeway in a state in the United States. The highway has one auxiliary route, [[Interstate 194 (Michigan)|I-194]], which serves downtown Battle Creek, and eight [[business route]]s. Various segments have been dedicated to multiple people and places.\n\n==Route description==\nThe entire length of I-94 is listed on the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]],<ref name=NHS-MI>{{cite map |author = Michigan Department of Transportation |date = April 23, 2006 |title = National Highway System, Michigan |scale = Scale not given |location = Lansing |publisher = Michigan Department of Transportation |url = http://www.michigan.gov/documents/MDOT_NHS_Statewide_150626_7.pdf |format = PDF |access-date = October 7, 2008 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080820003118/http://www.michigan.gov/documents/MDOT_NHS_Statewide_150626_7.pdf |archive-date = August 20, 2008 }}</ref> a network of roadways important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.<ref name=NHS>{{cite web |first1 = Stefan |last1 = Natzke |first2 = Mike |last2 = Neathery |first3 = Kevin |last3 = Adderly |last-author-amp = yes |url = http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/national_highway_system/ |title = What is the National Highway System? |work = National Highway System |publisher = [[Federal Highway Administration]] |date = June 20, 2012 |access-date = July 1, 2012 |archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/6AqyL2SJA?url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/national_highway_system/ |archive-date = September 21, 2012 |url-status = live }}</ref> The freeway carried 168,200&nbsp;vehicles [[annual average daily traffic|on average]] between [[Interstate 75 in Michigan|I-75]] and Chene Street in [[Detroit]], which is the peak traffic count in 2015, and it carried 12,554&nbsp;vehicles immediately west of the [[Blue Water Bridge]] in [[Port Huron, Michigan|Port Huron]], the lowest traffic count in 2015.<ref name=TMIS>{{cite web |author = Bureau of Transportation Planning |year = 2015 |url = http://mdotnetpublic.state.mi.us/tmispublic/ |title = Traffic Monitoring Information System |publisher = Michigan Department of Transportation |access-date = December 14, 2016 }}</ref> As the state trunkline highway closest to the lake shore in these areas, I-94 carries the [[Lake Michigan Circle Tour]] south of [[Benton Harbor, Michigan|Benton Harbor]]\u2013[[St. Joseph, Michigan|St. Joseph]] and the [[Lake Huron Circle Tour]] in the Port Huron area.<ref name=MDOT13/> Sections through the Detroit area are named the Detroit Industrial and Edsel Ford freeways.

There was some initial support to name it after [[Roy Chapin]], the late president of the [[Hudson Motor Car Company]] and a former [[United States Secretary of Commerce]] under President [[Herbert Hoover]]. On April 23, 1946, the [[Detroit Common Council]] voted instead to name the highway after [[Edsel Ford]], the son of [[Henry Ford]] and president of the [[Ford Motor Company]] from 1918 until his death in 1943.<ref name=barnett81>{{harvp|Barnett|2004|p=81|ps=.}}</ref>\n\nTwo other original sections of I-94's predecessor highways in the Detroit area were given early names.

During his tenure in Congress, he procured federal funds for the construction of I-94 through his district. The first attempt to name the highway after him failed in 1991, but the honor was included in a budget bill passed in 1997. The section of I-94 was dedicated on October 16, 1998, after donors privately raised nearly $10,000 (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US-GDP|10000|1998}}}} in {{inflation-year|US-GDP}}{{inflation-fn|last-author-amp =yes|US-GDP}}) to pay for the highway signs.<ref name=barnett117>{{harvp|Barnett|2004|p=117|ps=.}}</ref>\n\nA segment of I-94 in [[Battle Creek, Michigan|Battle Creek]] between the exits for [[Interstate 94 Business (Battle Creek, Michigan)|Business Loop I-94]] (BL I-94) and [[Interstate 194 (Michigan)|I-194]] was named the 94th Combat Infantry Division Memorial Highway by the Michigan Legislature in 2002. The name honors the US Army's [[94th Infantry Division (United States)|94th Infantry Division]], which was activated at nearby [[Fort Custer Training Center|Fort Custer]] in 1942 and served with distinction in the European theater of World War II. Because the unit originated in Battle Creek, and its number matched that of the freeway, the Legislature added the designation by passing Public Act&nbsp;305 of 2002.

In Michigan, it is a [[Michigan State Trunkline Highway System|state trunkline highway]] that enters the state south of [[New Buffalo, Michigan|New Buffalo]] and runs eastward through several metropolitan areas in the southern section of the state. The highway serves [[Benton Harbor, Michigan|Benton Harbor]]\u2013[[St. Joseph, Michigan|St. Joseph]] near [[Lake Michigan]] before turning inland toward [[Kalamazoo, Michigan|Kalamazoo]] and [[Battle Creek, Michigan|Battle Creek]] on the west side of the peninsula. Heading farther east, I-94 passes through rural areas in the middle of the southern Lower Peninsula, crossing [[Interstate 69 in Michigan|I-69]] in the process. I-94 then runs through [[Jackson, Michigan|Jackson]], [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]], and portions of [[Metro Detroit]], connecting Michigan's largest city to its [[Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport|main airport]]. Past the east side of [[Detroit]], the Interstate angles northeasterly through farmlands in [[The Thumb]] to [[Port Huron, Michigan|Port Huron]], where the designation terminates on the [[Blue Water Bridge]] at the [[Canada\u2013United States border|Canadian border]].\n\nThe first segment of what later became I-94 within the state, the Willow Run Expressway, was built near [[Ypsilanti, Michigan|Ypsilanti]] and [[Belleville, Michigan|Belleville]] in 1941, with an easterly extension to Detroit in 1945. This expressway was initially numbered '''M-112'''. In the mid-1950s, state and federal officials planned an Interstate to replace the original route of [[U.S. Route 12 in Michigan|U.S. Highway&nbsp;12]] (US&nbsp;12). By 1960, the length of I-94 was completed from Detroit to New Buffalo. Two years later, the US&nbsp;12 designation was dropped from the freeway. Subsequent extensions in the 1960s completed most of the rest of the route, including the remaining sections between Detroit and Port Huron which superseded the routing of [[U.S. Route 25 in Michigan|US&nbsp;25]]. The last segment opened to the public in 1972 when Indiana completed its connection across the state line. Since completion, I-94 has remained relatively unchanged; a few interchanges have been rebuilt, a second span was constructed for the Blue Water Bridge, and in 1987, [[Northwest Airlines Flight 255|a plane crashed]] on the freeway during takeoff from the airport in Detroit. The routing of I-94 is notable for containing the [[Ford\u2013Lodge interchange|first full freeway-to-freeway interchange in the United States]], connecting to the Lodge Freeway ([[M-10 (Michigan highway)|M-10]]), and for comprising the first complete border-to-border toll-free freeway in a state in the United States. The highway has one auxiliary route, [[Interstate 194 (Michigan)|I-194]], which serves downtown Battle Creek, and eight [[business route]]s. Various segments have been dedicated to multiple people and places.\n\n==Route description==\nThe entire length of I-94 is listed on the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]],<ref name=NHS-MI>{{cite map |author = Michigan Department of Transportation |date = April 23, 2006 |title = National Highway System, Michigan |scale = Scale not given |location = Lansing |publisher = Michigan Department of Transportation |url = http://www.michigan.gov/documents/MDOT_NHS_Statewide_150626_7.pdf |format = PDF |access-date = October 7, 2008 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080820003118/http://www.michigan.gov/documents/MDOT_NHS_Statewide_150626_7.pdf |archive-date = August 20, 2008 }}</ref> a network of roadways important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.<ref name=NHS>{{cite web |first1 = Stefan |last1 = Natzke |first2 = Mike |last2 = Neathery |first3 = Kevin |last3 = Adderly |last-author-amp = yes |url = http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/national_highway_system/ |title = What is the National Highway System? |work = National Highway System |publisher = [[Federal Highway Administration]] |date = June 20, 2012 |access-date = July 1, 2012 |archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/6AqyL2SJA?url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/national_highway_system/ |archive-date = September 21, 2012 |url-status = live }}</ref> The freeway carried 168,200&nbsp;vehicles [[annual average daily traffic|on average]] between [[Interstate 75 in Michigan|I-75]] and Chene Street in [[Detroit]], which is the peak traffic count in 2015, and it carried 12,554&nbsp;vehicles immediately west of the [[Blue Water Bridge]] in [[Port Huron, Michigan|Port Huron]], the lowest traffic count in 2015.<ref name=TMIS>{{cite web |author = Bureau of Transportation Planning |year = 2015 |url = http://mdotnetpublic.state.mi.us/tmispublic/ |title = Traffic Monitoring Information System |publisher = Michigan Department of Transportation |access-date = December 14, 2016 }}</ref> As the state trunkline highway closest to the lake shore in these areas, I-94 carries the [[Lake Michigan Circle Tour]] south of [[Benton Harbor, Michigan|Benton Harbor]]\u2013[[St. Joseph, Michigan|St. Joseph]] and the [[Lake Huron Circle Tour]] in the Port Huron area.<ref name=MDOT13/> Sections through the Detroit area are named the Detroit Industrial and Edsel Ford freeways.

There was some initial support to name it after [[Roy Chapin]], the late president of the [[Hudson Motor Car Company]] and a former [[United States Secretary of Commerce]] under President [[Herbert Hoover]]. On April 23, 1946, the [[Detroit Common Council]] voted instead to name the highway after [[Edsel Ford]], the son of [[Henry Ford]] and president of the [[Ford Motor Company]] from 1918 until his death in 1943.<ref name=barnett81>{{harvp|Barnett|2004|p=81|ps=.}}</ref>\n\nTwo other original sections of I-94's predecessor highways in the Detroit area were given early names. The westernmost of these is the Willow Run Expressway, named for the [[Willow Run]] complex. The plants at Willow Run produced [[B-24 Liberator]] bombers for Ford Motor Company during World War II.<ref name=barnett240>{{harvp|Barnett|2004|pp=240\u201341|ps=.}}</ref> The second, the Detroit Industrial Expressway, continued the route of the Willow Run Expressway eastward into Detroit. Both highways were built to move workers from Detroit to the industrial plants at Willow Run during the war and were later incorporated into I-94 in the 1950s as part of a Detroit\u2013Chicago highway.<ref name=barnett67>{{harvp|Barnett|2004|pp=67\u201368|ps=.}}</ref>\n\nThe section of I-94 northeast of Detroit was named after former Congressman [[James G. O'Hara]] by the [[Michigan Legislature]]. O'Hara was a World War II veteran who served in the [[United States House]] from 1959 until 1977. During his tenure in Congress, he procured federal funds for the construction of I-94 through his district. The first attempt to name the highway after him failed in 1991, but the honor was included in a budget bill passed in 1997. The section of I-94 was dedicated on October 16, 1998, after donors privately raised nearly $10,000 (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US-GDP|10000|1998}}}} in {{inflation-year|US-GDP}}{{inflation-fn|last-author-amp =yes|US-GDP}}) to pay for the highway signs.<ref name=barnett117>{{harvp|Barnett|2004|p=117|ps=.}}</ref>\n\nA segment of I-94 in [[Battle Creek, Michigan|Battle Creek]] between the exits for [[Interstate 94 Business (Battle Creek, Michigan)|Business Loop I-94]] (BL I-94) and [[Interstate 194 (Michigan)|I-194]] was named the 94th Combat Infantry Division Memorial Highway by the Michigan Legislature in 2002. The name honors the US Army's [[94th Infantry Division (United States)|94th Infantry Division]], which was activated at nearby [[Fort Custer Training Center|Fort Custer]] in 1942 and served with distinction in the European theater of World War II. Because the unit originated in Battle Creek, and its number matched that of the freeway, the Legislature added the designation by passing Public Act&nbsp;305 of 2002. The name was dedicated in ceremonies at a rest stop along the section of I-94 on September 28, 2002.<ref name=barnett163>{{harvp|Barnett|2004|pp=163\u20134|ps=.}}</ref>\n\nAnother piece of I-94 in Calhoun County was designated in 2004 as part of the Underground Railroad Memorial Highway.{{#tag:ref|The other highway so designated is a section of [[U.S. Route 131|US&nbsp;131]].<ref name=barnett215/>|group=lower-alpha}} Starting in 1990, the [[National Park Service]] started working to identify routes of the [[Underground Railroad]]. The Battle Creek area was active in the railroad during the Civil War, and the section of I-94 between exits 98 and 110 east of Battle Creek was included in the memorial designation.<ref name=barnett215>{{harvp|Barnett|2004|pp=215\u201316|ps=.}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2012, after a resolution passed by the [[Michigan Legislature]] was signed by Gov. [[Rick Snyder]], a portion of I-94 in [[Taylor, Michigan|Taylor]] between Inkster and Pelham roads was named the Auxiliary Lt.
