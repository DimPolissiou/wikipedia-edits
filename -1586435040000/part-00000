Career averages are based on a player's entire career and do not make any allowance for match conditions or the strength of the opposition, whereas the ratings are weighted towards recent form and account for match conditions and the quality of the opponent using statistical algorithms.<ref>{{cite web|title=About ICC Cricket Rankings|url=http://www.icc-cricket.com/player-rankings/about}}</ref>\n\nInitially the rankings were for [[Test cricket]] only, but separate [[One Day International]] rankings were introduced in 1998. Both sets of rankings have now been calculated back to the start of those forms of the game. The rankings include the top 10 Test, ODI and T20I batsmen, bowlers and all-rounders based on the rating of each player.\n\n==Rankings calculations==\nThe player rankings are a weighted average of all a player's performances, with recent matches weighted most heavily (so the overall effect of a good or bad performance decline over time). Each match performance is given a rating out of 1000, based on a set of pre-determined criteria, and these figures averaged.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.relianceiccrankings.com/about.php|title=ICC Player Rankings|website=www.relianceiccrankings.com|access-date=20 December 2018}}</ref> This means that the maximum possible overall rating is 1000, and a player gaining a rating of 900 is seen as an exceptional achievement.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.relianceiccrankings.com/faq.php|title=ICC Player Rankings|website=www.relianceiccrankings.com|access-date=20 December 2018}}</ref> Separate lists are maintained for batting and bowling and an all-rounder rating is also published, which is obtained by multiplying a player's batting and bowling rating together and dividing by 1000.\n\nFor batting, the performance rating is based on a combination of runs scored, the rating of the opposition bowlers, match result and comparison to the overall scores in the match.\nA bowler gains points based on wickets taken, runs conceded and match result, with more points gained for dismissing highly rated batsmen.\nA damping-factor is applied to a player's rating at the start of their career, so they do not get a full rating for their performances until they have played about 20 Tests.\n\n\n== Current rankings ==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n \n===Test rankings===\n \n==== Top 10 Test batsmen ====\n{{ICC Top 10 Test Batsmen}}\n \n==== Top 10 Test bowlers ====\n{{ICC Top 10 Test Bowlers}}\n \n==== ICC Top 10 Test all-rounders ====\n{{ICC Top 10 Test All-rounders}}\n \n{{Col-3}}\n \n===ODI rankings===\n==== Top 10 ODI batsmen ====\n{{ICC Top 10 ODI Batsmen}}\nBrandon Moses\n\n==== Top 10 ODI bowlers ====\n{{ICC Top 10 ODI Bowlers}}\n \n==== Top 10 ODI all-rounders====\n{{ICC Top 10 ODI All-rounders}}\n \n{{Col-3}}\n \n===T20I rankings===\n \n==== Top 10 T20I batsmen ====\n{{ICC Top 10 T20I Batsmen}}\n \n==== Top 10 T20I bowlers ====\n{{ICC Top 10 T20I Bowlers}}\n \n==== Top 10 T20I all-rounders ====\n{{ICC Top 10 T20I All-rounders}}\n \n{{col-end}}\n\n== Historical rankings ==\n\n=== Historical Test cricket rankings ===\n\n====Year end top ranked players in Test cricket====\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!

Career averages are based on a player's entire career and do not make any allowance for match conditions or the strength of the opposition, whereas the ratings are weighted towards recent form and account for match conditions and the quality of the opponent using statistical algorithms.<ref>{{cite web|title=About ICC Cricket Rankings|url=http://www.icc-cricket.com/player-rankings/about}}</ref>\n\nInitially the rankings were for [[Test cricket]] only, but separate [[One Day International]] rankings were introduced in 1998. Both sets of rankings have now been calculated back to the start of those forms of the game. The rankings include the top 10 Test, ODI and T20I batsmen, bowlers and all-rounders based on the rating of each player.\n\n==Rankings calculations==\nThe player rankings are a weighted average of all a player's performances, with recent matches weighted most heavily (so the overall effect of a good or bad performance decline over time). Each match performance is given a rating out of 1000, based on a set of pre-determined criteria, and these figures averaged.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.relianceiccrankings.com/about.php|title=ICC Player Rankings|website=www.relianceiccrankings.com|access-date=20 December 2018}}</ref> This means that the maximum possible overall rating is 1000, and a player gaining a rating of 900 is seen as an exceptional achievement.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.relianceiccrankings.com/faq.php|title=ICC Player Rankings|website=www.relianceiccrankings.com|access-date=20 December 2018}}</ref> Separate lists are maintained for batting and bowling and an all-rounder rating is also published, which is obtained by multiplying a player's batting and bowling rating together and dividing by 1000.\n\nFor batting, the performance rating is based on a combination of runs scored, the rating of the opposition bowlers, match result and comparison to the overall scores in the match.\nA bowler gains points based on wickets taken, runs conceded and match result, with more points gained for dismissing highly rated batsmen.\nA damping-factor is applied to a player's rating at the start of their career, so they do not get a full rating for their performances until they have played about 20 Tests.\n\n\n== Current rankings ==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n \n===Test rankings===\n \n==== Top 10 Test batsmen ====\n{{ICC Top 10 Test Batsmen}}\n \n==== Top 10 Test bowlers ====\n{{ICC Top 10 Test Bowlers}}\n \n==== ICC Top 10 Test all-rounders ====\n{{ICC Top 10 Test All-rounders}}\n \n{{Col-3}}\n \n===ODI rankings===\n==== Top 10 ODI batsmen ====\n{{ICC Top 10 ODI Batsmen}}\n\n==== Top 10 ODI bowlers ====\n{{ICC Top 10 ODI Bowlers}}\n \n==== Top 10 ODI all-rounders====\n{{ICC Top 10 ODI All-rounders}}\n \n{{Col-3}}\n \n===T20I rankings===\n \n==== Top 10 T20I batsmen ====\n{{ICC Top 10 T20I Batsmen}}\n \n==== Top 10 T20I bowlers ====\n{{ICC Top 10 T20I Bowlers}}\n \n==== Top 10 T20I all-rounders ====\n{{ICC Top 10 T20I All-rounders}}\n \n{{col-end}}\n\n== Historical rankings ==\n\n=== Historical Test cricket rankings ===\n\n====Year end top ranked players in Test cricket====\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!
