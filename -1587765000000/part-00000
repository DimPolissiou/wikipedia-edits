{"title_page": "Deformation theory", "text_new": "{{Short description|branch of mathematics}}\n\nIn [[mathematics]], '''deformation theory''' is the study of ''infinitesimal conditions'' associated with varying a solution ''P'' of a problem to slightly different solutions ''P''<sub>\u03b5</sub>, where \u03b5 is a small number, or vector of small quantities. The infinitesimal conditions are therefore the result of applying the approach of [[differential calculus]] to solving a problem with [[Constraint (mathematics)|constraint]]s. One might  think, in analogy, of a structure that is not completely rigid, and that deforms slightly to accommodate forces applied from the outside; this explains the name.\n\nSome characteristic phenomena are: the derivation of first-order equations by treating the \u03b5 quantities as having negligible squares; the possibility of ''isolated solutions'', in that varying a solution may not be possible, ''or'' does not bring anything new; and the question of whether the infinitesimal constraints actually 'integrate', so that their solution does provide small variations. In some form these considerations have a history of centuries in mathematics, but also in [[physics]] and [[engineering]]. For example, in the [[geometry of numbers]] a class of results called ''isolation theorems'' was recognised, with the topological interpretation of an ''open orbit'' (of a [[Group action (mathematics)|group action]]) around a given solution. [[Perturbation theory]] also looks at deformations, in general of [[Operator (mathematics)|operator]]s.\n\n==Deformations of complex manifolds==\nThe most salient deformation theory in mathematics has been that of [[complex manifold]]s and [[algebraic varieties]]. This was put on a firm basis by foundational work of [[Kunihiko Kodaira]] and [[Donald C. Spencer]], after deformation techniques had received a great deal of more tentative application in the [[Italian school of algebraic geometry]]. One expects, intuitively, that deformation theory of the first order should equate the [[Zariski tangent space]] with a [[moduli space]]. The phenomena turn out to be rather subtle, though, in the general case.\n\nIn the case of [[Riemann surface]]s, one can explain that the complex structure on the [[Riemann sphere]] is isolated (no moduli). For genus 1, an [[elliptic curve]] has a one-parameter family of complex structures, as shown in [[elliptic function]] theory. The general Kodaira\u2013Spencer theory identifies as the key to the deformation theory the [[sheaf cohomology]] group\n\n: <math> H^1(\\Theta) \\, </math>\n\nwhere \u0398 is (the sheaf of [[Germ (mathematics)|germs]] of sections of) the holomorphic [[tangent bundle]]. There is an obstruction in the ''H''<sup>2</sup> of the same sheaf; which is always zero in case of a curve, for general reasons of dimension. In the case of genus 0 the ''H''<sup>1</sup> vanishes, also. For genus 1 the dimension is the [[Hodge number]] ''h''<sup>1,0</sup> which is therefore 1.  It is known that all curves of genus one have equations of form ''y''<sup>2</sup> = ''x''<sup>3</sup> + ''ax'' + ''b''.  These obviously depend on two parameters, a and b, whereas the isomorphism classes of such curves have only one parameter.  Hence there must be an equation relating those a and b which describe isomorphic elliptic curves.  It turns out that curves for which ''b''<sup>2</sup>''a''<sup>\u22123</sup> has the same value, describe isomorphic curves.  I.e. varying a and b is one way to deform the structure of the curve ''y''<sup>2</sup> = ''x''<sup>3</sup> + ''ax'' + ''b'', but not all variations of ''a,b'' actually change the isomorphism class of the curve.\n\nOne can go further with the case of genus ''g'' > 1, using [[Serre duality]] to relate the  ''H''<sup>1</sup> to\n\n: <math> H^0(\\Omega^{[2]}) </math>\n\nwhere \u03a9 is the holomorphic [[cotangent bundle]] and the notation \u03a9<sup>[2]</sup> means the ''tensor square'' (''not'' the second [[exterior power]]). In other words, deformations are regulated by holomorphic [[quadratic differential]]s on a Riemann surface, again something known classically. The dimension of the moduli space, called [[Teichm\u00fcller space]] in this case, is computed as 3''g'' &minus; 3, by the [[Riemann\u2013Roch theorem]].\n\nThese examples are the beginning of a theory applying to holomorphic families of complex manifolds, of any dimension. Further developments included: the extension by Spencer of the techniques to other structures of [[differential geometry]]; the assimilation of the Kodaira\u2013Spencer theory into the abstract algebraic geometry of [[Grothendieck]], with a consequent substantive clarification of earlier work; and deformation theory of other structures, such as algebras.\n\n== Deformations and flat maps ==\nThe most general form of a deformation is a flat map <math>f:X \\to S</math> of complex-analytic spaces, schemes, or germs of functions on a space. Grothendieck<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Palamodov|first=|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-61263-3_3|title=Deformations of Complex Spaces|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> was the first to find this far-reaching generalization for deformations and developed the theory in that context. The general idea is there should exist a '''universal family''' <math>\\mathfrak{X} \\to B</math> such that any deformation can be found as a ''unique'' pullback square<blockquote><math>\\begin{matrix}\nX & \\to & \\mathfrak{X} \\\\\n\\downarrow & & \\downarrow \\\\\nS & \\to & B\n\\end{matrix}</math></blockquote>In many cases, this universal family is either a [[Hilbert scheme]] or [[Quot scheme]], or a quotient of one of them. For example, in the construction of the [[Moduli of curves]], it is constructed as a quotient of the smooth curves in the Hilbert scheme. If the pullback square is not unique, then the family is only '''versal'''.\n\n== Deformations of germs of analytic algebras ==\nOne of the useful and readily computatable areas of deformation theory comes from the deformation theory of germs of complex spaces, such as [[Stein manifold|stein manifolds]], [[Complex manifold|complex manifolds]], or [[Complex analytic variety|complex analytic varieties]]<ref name=\":0\" />. Note that this theory can be '''globalized''' to complex manifolds and complex analytic spaces by considering the sheaves of germs of holomorphic functions, tangent spaces, etc. Such algebras are of the form<blockquote><math>A \\cong \\frac{\\mathbb{C}\\{z_1,\\ldots, z_n\\}}{I}</math> </blockquote>where <math>\\mathbb{C}\\{z_1,\\ldots,z_n \\}</math> is the ring of convergent power-series and <math>I</math> is an ideal. For example, many authors study the germs of functions of a singularity, such as the algebra<blockquote><math>A \\cong \\frac{\\mathbb{C}\\{z_1,\\ldots,z_n\\}}{(y^2 - x^n)}</math></blockquote>representing a plane-curve singularity. A '''germ of analytic algebras''' is then an object in the opposite category of such algebras. Then, a '''deformation''' of a germ of analytic algebras <math>X_0</math> is given by a flat map of germs of analytic algebras <math>f:X \\to S</math> where <math>S</math> has a distinguished point <math>0</math> such that the <math>X_0</math> fits into the pullback square<blockquote><math>\\begin{matrix}\nX_0 & \\to & X \\\\\n\\downarrow & & \\downarrow \\\\\n* & \\xrightarrow[0]{} & S\n\\end{matrix}</math></blockquote>These deformations have an equivalence relation given by commutative squares<blockquote><math>\\begin{matrix}\nX'& \\to & X \\\\\n\\downarrow & & \\downarrow \\\\\nS' & \\to & S\n\\end{matrix}</math></blockquote>where the horizontal arrows are isomorphisms. For example, there is a deformation of the plane curve singularity given by the opposite diagram of the commutative diagram of analytic algebras<blockquote><math>\\begin{matrix}\n\\frac{\\mathbb {C} \\{x,y\\}}{(y^{2}-x^{n})} & \\leftarrow & \\frac{\\mathbb {C} \\{x,y, s\\}}{(y^{2}-x^{n} + s)} \\\\\n\\uparrow & & \\uparrow \\\\\n\\mathbb{C} & \\leftarrow & \\mathbb{C}\\{s\\}\n\\end{matrix}</math></blockquote>In fact, Milnor studied such deformations, where a singularity is deformed by a constant, hence the fiber over a non-zero <math>s</math> is called the '''Milnor fiber'''.\n\n=== Cohomological Interpretation of deformations ===\nIt should be clear there could be many deformations of a single germ of analytic functions. Because of this, there are some book-keeping devices required to organize all of this information. These organizational devices are constructed using tangent cohomology<ref name=\":0\" />. This is formed by using the [[Koszul\u2013Tate resolution]], and potentially modifying it by adding additional generators for non-regular algebras <math>A</math>. In the case of analytic algebras these resolutions are called the '''Tjurina resolution''' for the mathematician who first studied such objects. This is a graded-commutative differential graded algebra <math>(R_\\bullet, s)</math> such that <math>R_0 \\to A</math> is a surjective map of analytic algebras, and this map fits into an exact sequence<blockquote><math>\\cdots \\xrightarrow{s} R_{-2} \\xrightarrow{s} R_{-1} \\xrightarrow{s} R_0 \\xrightarrow{p} A \\to 0</math></blockquote>Then, by taking the differential graded module of derivations <math>(\\text{Der}(R_\\bullet), d)</math>, its cohomology forms the '''tangent cohomology''' of the germ of analytic algebras <math>A</math>. These cohomology groups are denoted <math>T^k(A)</math>. The <math>T^1(A)</math> contains information about all of the deformations of <math>A</math> and can be readily computed using the exact sequence<blockquote><math>0 \\to T^0(A) \\to \\text{Der}(R_0) \\xrightarrow{d} \\text{Hom}_{R_0}(I,A) \\to T^1(A) \\to 0</math></blockquote>If <math>A</math> is isomorphic to the algebra<blockquote><math>\\frac{\\mathbb{C}\\{z_1,\\ldots,z_n\\}}{(f_1,\\ldots, f_m)}</math></blockquote>then its deformations are equal to<blockquote><math>T^1(A) \\cong \\frac{A^m}{df \\cdot A^n}</math></blockquote>were <math>df</math> is the jacobian matrix of <math>f = (f_1,\\ldots, f_m): \\mathbb{C}^n \\to \\mathbb{C}^m</math>. For example, the deformations of a hypersurface given by <math>f</math> has the deformations<blockquote><math>T^1(A) \\cong \\frac{A^n}{\\left( \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z_1}, \\ldots, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z_n} \\right)}</math></blockquote>For the singularity <math>y^2 - x^3</math> this is the module<blockquote><math>\\frac{A^2}{(y, x^2)}</math></blockquote>hence the only deformations are given by adding constants or linear factors, so a general deformation of <math>y^2 - x^3</math> is <math>y^2 - x^3 + a_1 + a_2x </math> where <math>a_i</math> are constants. \n\n==Functorial description==\nAnother method for formalizing deformation theory is using functors on the category <math>\\text{Art}_k</math> of local Artin algebras over a field. A '''pre-deformation functor''' is defined as a functor\n:<math>F: \\text{Art}_k \\to \\text{Sets}</math>\nsuch that <math>F(k)</math> is a point. The idea is that we want to study the infinitesimal structure of some [[moduli space]] around a point where lying above that point is the space of interest. It is typically the case that it is easier to describe the functor for a moduli problem instead of finding an actual space. For example, if we want to consider the moduli-space of hypersurfaces of degree <math>d</math> in <math>\\mathbb{P}^n</math>, then we could consider the functor\n:<math>F: \\text{Sch} \\to \\text{Sets}</math>\nwhere\n:<math>\nF(S) = \\left\\{\n\\begin{matrix}\nX \\\\\n\\downarrow \\\\\nS\n\\end{matrix}\n: \\text{ each fiber is a degree } d \\text{ hypersurface in }\\mathbb{P}^n\\right\\}\n</math>\n\nAlthough in general, it is more convenient/required to work with functors of [[groupoid|groupoids]] instead of sets. This is true for moduli of curves.\n\n===Technical remarks about infinitesimals===\nInfinitesimals have long been in use by mathematicians for non-rigorous arguments in calculus. The idea is that if we consider polynomials <math>F(x,\\varepsilon)</math> with an infinitesimal <math>\\varepsilon</math>, then only the first order terms really matter; that is, we can consider\n:<math> F(x,\\varepsilon) \\equiv f(x) + \\varepsilon g(x) + O(\\varepsilon^2)</math>\nA simple application of this is that we can find the derivatives of [[monomial|monomials]] using infinitesimals:\n:<math> (x+\\varepsilon)^3 = x^3 + 3x^2\\varepsilon + O(\\varepsilon^2)</math>\nthe <math>\\varepsilon</math> term contains the derivative of the monomial, demonstrating its use in calculus. We could also interpret this equation as the first two terms of the Taylor expansion of the monomial. Infinitesimals can be made rigorous using nilpotent elements in local artin algebras. In the ring <math>k[y]/(y^2)</math> we see that arguments with infinitesimals can work. This motivates the notation <math>k[\\varepsilon] = k[y]/(y^2)</math>, which is called the [[Ring of dual numbers]]. \n\nMoreover, if we want to consider higher-order terms of a taylor approximation then we could consider the artin algebras <math>k[y]/(y^k)</math>. For our monomial, suppose we want to write out the second order expansion, then\n:<math>(x+\\varepsilon)^3 = x^3 + 3x^2\\varepsilon + 3x\\varepsilon^2 + \\varepsilon^3</math>\nRecall that a Taylor expansion (at zero) can be written out as\n:<math>f(x) = f(0) + \\frac{f^{(1)}(x)}{1!} + \\frac{f^{(2)}(x)}{2!} + \\frac{f^{(3)}(x)}{3!} + \\cdots </math>\nhence the previous two equations show that the second derivative of <math>x^3</math> is <math>6x</math>.\n\nIn general, since we want to consider arbitrary order Taylor expansions in any number of variables, we will consider the category of all local artin algebras over a field.\n\n===Motivation===\nTo motivative the definition of a pre-deformation functor, consider the projective hypersurface over a field\n:<math>\n\\begin{matrix}\n\\operatorname{Proj}\\left( \\dfrac{\\mathbb{C}[x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3]}{(x_0^4 + x_1^4 + x_2^4 + x_3^4)} \\right) \\\\\n\\downarrow \\\\\n\\operatorname{Spec}(k)\n\\end{matrix}\n</math>\nIf we want to consider an infinitesimal deformation of this space, then we could write down a Cartesian square\n:<math>\n\\begin{matrix}\n\\operatorname{Proj}\\left( \\dfrac{\\mathbb{C}[x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3]}{(x_0^4 + x_1^4 + x_2^4 + x_3^4)} \\right) & \\to & \\operatorname{Proj}\\left( \\dfrac{ \\mathbb{C}[x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3][\\varepsilon]}{(x_0^4 + x_1^4 + x_2^4 + x_3^4 + \\varepsilon  x_0^{a_0} x_1^{a_1} x_2^{a_2} x_3^{a_3}) } \\right) \\\\\n\\downarrow & & \\downarrow\\\\\n\\operatorname{Spec}(k) & \\to & \\operatorname{Spec}(k[\\varepsilon])\n\\end{matrix}\n</math>\nwhere <math>a_0 + a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 4</math>. Then, the space on the right hand corner is one example of an infinitesimal deformation: the extra scheme theoretic structure of the nilpotent elements in <math>\\operatorname{Spec}(k[\\varepsilon])</math> (which is topologically a point) allows us to organize this infinitesimal data. Since we want to consider all possible expansions, we will let our predeformation functor be defined on objects as\n:<math>\nF(A) = \\left\\{\n\\begin{matrix}\n\\operatorname{Proj}\\left( \\dfrac{\\mathbb{C}[x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3]}{(x_0^4 + x_1^4 + x_2^4 + x_3^4)} \\right) & \\to & \\mathfrak{X} \\\\\n\\downarrow & & \\downarrow \\\\\n\\operatorname{Spec}(k) & \\to & \\operatorname{Spec}(A)\n\\end{matrix}\n\\right\\}\n</math>\nwhere <math>A</math> is a local Artin <math>k</math>-algebra.\n\n===Smooth pre-deformation functors===\nA pre-deformation functor is called '''smooth''' if for any surjection <math>A' \\to A</math> such that the square of any element in the kernel is zero, there is a surjection\n:<math>F(A') \\to F(A)</math>\nThis is motivated by the following question: given a deformation\n:<math>\n\\begin{matrix}\nX & \\to & \\mathfrak{X} \\\\\n\\downarrow & & \\downarrow \\\\\n\\operatorname{Spec}(k) & \\to & \\operatorname{Spec}(A)\n\\end{matrix}\n</math>\ndoes there exist an extension of this cartesian diagram to the cartesian diagrams\n:<math>\n\\begin{matrix}\nX & \\to & \\mathfrak{X} & \\to & \\mathfrak{X}' \\\\\n\\downarrow & & \\downarrow & & \\downarrow \\\\\n\\operatorname{Spec}(k) & \\to & \\operatorname{Spec}(A) & \\to & \\operatorname{Spec}(A')\n\\end{matrix}\n</math>\nthe name smooth comes from the lifting criterion of a smooth morphism of schemes.\n\n===Tangent space===\nRecall that the tangent space of a scheme <math>X</math> can be described as the <math>\\operatorname{Hom}</math>-set\n:<math>TX := \\operatorname{Hom}_{\\text{Sch}/k}(\\operatorname{Spec}(k[\\varepsilon]),X)</math>\n\nwhere the source is the ring of [[Dual number#Dual numbers over an arbitrary ring|dual numbers]]. Since we are considering the tangent space of a point of some moduli space, we can define the tangent space of our (pre)-deformation functor as\n:<math>T_F := F(k[\\varepsilon])</math>\n\n== Applications of deformation theory ==\n\n=== Dimension of moduli of curves ===\nOne of the first properties of the [[moduli of algebraic curves]] <math>\\mathcal{M}_g</math> can be deduced using elementary deformation theory. Its dimension can be computed as<blockquote><math>\\dim(\\mathcal{M}_g) = \\dim H^1(C,T_C)</math></blockquote>for an arbitrary smooth curve of genus <math>g</math> because the deformation space is the tangent space of the moduli space. Using [[Serre duality]] the tangent space is isomorphic to<blockquote><math>\\begin{align}\nH^1(C,T_C) &\\cong H^0(C,T_C^* \\otimes \\omega_C)^\\vee \\\\\n&\\cong H^0(C,\\omega_C^{\\otimes 2})^\\vee\n\\end{align}</math></blockquote>Hence the [[Riemann\u2013Roch theorem]] gives<blockquote><math>\\begin{align}\nh^0(C,\\omega_C^{\\otimes 2}) - h^1(C,\\omega_C^{\\otimes 2}) &= 2(2g - 2) - g - 1 \\\\\n &= 3g - 3\n\\end{align}</math></blockquote>For curves of genus <math>g \\geq 2</math> the <math>h^1(C,\\omega_C^{\\otimes 2}) = 0</math> because<blockquote><math>h^1(C,\\omega_C^{\\otimes 2}) = h^0(C, (\\omega_C^{\\otimes 2})^{\\vee}\\otimes \\omega_C)\n</math></blockquote>the degree is<blockquote><math>\\begin{align}\n\\text{deg}((\\omega_C^{\\otimes 2})^\\vee \\otimes \\omega_C) &= 4 - 4g + 2g - 2  \\\\\n&= 2 - 2g\n\\end{align}</math></blockquote>and <math>h^0(L) = 0</math> for line bundles of negative degree. Therefore the dimension of the moduli space is <math>3g - 3</math>.\n\n=== Bend-and-break ===\nDeformation theory was famously applied in [[birational geometry]] by [[Shigefumi Mori]] to study the existence of [[rational curve]]s on [[algebraic variety|varieties]].<ref>{{cite book| first=Olivier|last = Debarre | author-link = Olivier Debarre|  title = Higher-Dimensional Algebraic Geometry|year = 2001 | publisher= Springer| chapter = 3. Bend-and-Break Lemmas | series = Universitext}}</ref> For a [[Fano variety]] of positive dimension Mori showed that there is a rational curve passing through every point. The method of the proof later became known as '''Mori's bend-and-break'''. The rough idea is to start with some curve ''C'' through a chosen point and keep deforming it until it breaks into several [[irreducible component|components]]. Replacing ''C'' by one of the components has the effect of decreasing either the   [[genus of a curve|genus]] or the [[degree of an algebraic variety|degree]] of ''C''. So after several repetitions of the procedure, eventually we'll obtain a curve of genus 0, i.e. a rational curve. The existence and the properties of deformations of ''C'' require arguments from deformation theory and a reduction to [[positive characteristic]].\n\n===Arithmetic deformations===\nOne of the major applications of deformation theory is in arithmetic. It can be used to answer the following question: if we have a variety <math>X/\\mathbb{F}_p</math>, what are the possible extensions <math>\\mathfrak{X}/\\mathbb{Z}_p</math>? If our variety is a curve, then the vanishing <math>H^2</math> implies that every deformation induces a variety over <math>\\mathbb{Z}_p</math>; that is, if we have a smooth curve\n:<math>\n\\begin{matrix}\nX \\\\\n\\downarrow \\\\\n\\operatorname{Spec}(\\mathbb{F}_p)\n\\end{matrix}\n</math>\nand a deformation\n:<math>\n\\begin{matrix}\nX & \\to & \\mathfrak{X}_2 \\\\\n\\downarrow & & \\downarrow \\\\\n\\operatorname{Spec}(\\mathbb{F}_p) & \\to & \\operatorname{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z}/(p^2))\n\\end{matrix}\n</math>\nthen we can always extend it to a diagram of the form\n:<math>\n\\begin{matrix}\nX & \\to & \\mathfrak{X}_2 & \\to & \\mathfrak{X}_3 & \\to \\cdots \\\\\n\\downarrow & & \\downarrow & & \\downarrow &  \\\\\n\\operatorname{Spec}(\\mathbb{F}_p) & \\to & \\operatorname{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z}/(p^2)) & \\to & \\operatorname{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z}/(p^3)) & \\to \\cdots\n\\end{matrix}\n</math>\n\nThis implies that we can construct a [[formal scheme]] <math>\\mathfrak{X} = \\operatorname{Spet}(\\mathfrak{X}_\\bullet)</math> giving a curve over <math>\\mathbb{Z}_p</math>.\n=== Deformations of abelian schemes ===\n\nThe [[Serre\u2013Tate theorem]] asserts, roughly speaking, that the deformations of [[abelian variety|abelian scheme]] ''A'' is controlled by deformations of the [[p-divisible group|''p''-divisible group]] <math>A[p^\\infty]</math> consisting of its ''p''-power torsion points.\n\n=== Galois deformations ===\nAnother application of deformation theory is with Galois deformations. It allows us to answer the question: If we have a Galois representation\n:<math>G \\to \\operatorname{GL}_n(\\mathbb{F}_p)</math>\nhow can we extend it to a representation\n:<math>G \\to \\operatorname{GL}_n(\\mathbb{Z}_p) \\text{?}</math>\n\n==Relationship to string theory==\nThe so-called [[Deligne conjecture]] arising in the context of algebras (and [[Hochschild cohomology]]) stimulated much interest in deformation theory in relation to [[string theory]] (roughly speaking, to formalise the idea that a string theory can be regarded as a deformation of a point-particle theory). This is now accepted as proved, after some hitches with early announcements. [[Maxim Kontsevich]] is among those who have offered a generally accepted proof of this.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Kodaira\u2013Spencer map]]\n*[[Dual number]]\n*[[Exalcomm]]\n* [[Cotangent complex]]\n* [[Gromov\u2013Witten invariant]]\n* [[Moduli of algebraic curves]]\n* [[Degeneration (algebraic geometry)]]\n\n==References==\n===Pedagogical===\n*Palamodov, V.

The infinitesimal conditions are therefore the result of applying the approach of [[differential calculus]] to solving a problem with [[Constraint (mathematics)|constraint]]s. One might  think, in analogy, of a structure that is not completely rigid, and that deforms slightly to accommodate forces applied from the outside; this explains the name.\n\nSome characteristic phenomena are: the derivation of first-order equations by treating the \u03b5 quantities as having negligible squares; the possibility of ''isolated solutions'', in that varying a solution may not be possible, ''or'' does not bring anything new; and the question of whether the infinitesimal constraints actually 'integrate', so that their solution does provide small variations. In some form these considerations have a history of centuries in mathematics, but also in [[physics]] and [[engineering]]. For example, in the [[geometry of numbers]] a class of results called ''isolation theorems'' was recognised, with the topological interpretation of an ''open orbit'' (of a [[Group action (mathematics)|group action]]) around a given solution. [[Perturbation theory]] also looks at deformations, in general of [[Operator (mathematics)|operator]]s.\n\n==Deformations of complex manifolds==\nThe most salient deformation theory in mathematics has been that of [[complex manifold]]s and [[algebraic varieties]]. This was put on a firm basis by foundational work of [[Kunihiko Kodaira]] and [[Donald C. Spencer]], after deformation techniques had received a great deal of more tentative application in the [[Italian school of algebraic geometry]]. One expects, intuitively, that deformation theory of the first order should equate the [[Zariski tangent space]] with a [[moduli space]]. The phenomena turn out to be rather subtle, though, in the general case.\n\nIn the case of [[Riemann surface]]s, one can explain that the complex structure on the [[Riemann sphere]] is isolated (no moduli). For genus 1, an [[elliptic curve]] has a one-parameter family of complex structures, as shown in [[elliptic function]] theory. The general Kodaira\u2013Spencer theory identifies as the key to the deformation theory the [[sheaf cohomology]] group\n\n: <math> H^1(\\Theta) \\, </math>\n\nwhere \u0398 is (the sheaf of [[Germ (mathematics)|germs]] of sections of) the holomorphic [[tangent bundle]]. There is an obstruction in the ''H''<sup>2</sup> of the same sheaf; which is always zero in case of a curve, for general reasons of dimension. In the case of genus 0 the ''H''<sup>1</sup> vanishes, also. For genus 1 the dimension is the [[Hodge number]] ''h''<sup>1,0</sup> which is therefore 1.  It is known that all curves of genus one have equations of form ''y''<sup>2</sup> = ''x''<sup>3</sup> + ''ax'' + ''b''.  These obviously depend on two parameters, a and b, whereas the isomorphism classes of such curves have only one parameter.  Hence there must be an equation relating those a and b which describe isomorphic elliptic curves.  It turns out that curves for which ''b''<sup>2</sup>''a''<sup>\u22123</sup> has the same value, describe isomorphic curves.  I.e. varying a and b is one way to deform the structure of the curve ''y''<sup>2</sup> = ''x''<sup>3</sup> + ''ax'' + ''b'', but not all variations of ''a,b'' actually change the isomorphism class of the curve.\n\nOne can go further with the case of genus ''g'' > 1, using [[Serre duality]] to relate the  ''H''<sup>1</sup> to\n\n: <math> H^0(\\Omega^{[2]}) </math>\n\nwhere \u03a9 is the holomorphic [[cotangent bundle]] and the notation \u03a9<sup>[2]</sup> means the ''tensor square'' (''not'' the second [[exterior power]]). In other words, deformations are regulated by holomorphic [[quadratic differential]]s on a Riemann surface, again something known classically. The dimension of the moduli space, called [[Teichm\u00fcller space]] in this case, is computed as 3''g'' &minus; 3, by the [[Riemann\u2013Roch theorem]].\n\nThese examples are the beginning of a theory applying to holomorphic families of complex manifolds, of any dimension. Further developments included: the extension by Spencer of the techniques to other structures of [[differential geometry]]; the assimilation of the Kodaira\u2013Spencer theory into the abstract algebraic geometry of [[Grothendieck]], with a consequent substantive clarification of earlier work; and deformation theory of other structures, such as algebras.\n\n== Deformations and flat maps ==\nThe most general form of a deformation is a flat map <math>f:X \\to S</math> of complex-analytic spaces, schemes, or germs of functions on a space. Grothendieck<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Palamodov|first=|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-61263-3_3|title=Deformations of Complex Spaces|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> was the first to find this far-reaching generalization for deformations and developed the theory in that context. The general idea is there should exist a '''universal family''' <math>\\mathfrak{X} \\to B</math> such that any deformation can be found as a ''unique'' pullback square<blockquote><math>\\begin{matrix}\nX & \\to & \\mathfrak{X} \\\\\n\\downarrow & & \\downarrow \\\\\nS & \\to & B\n\\end{matrix}</math></blockquote>In many cases, this universal family is either a [[Hilbert scheme]] or [[Quot scheme]], or a quotient of one of them. For example, in the construction of the [[Moduli of curves]], it is constructed as a quotient of the smooth curves in the Hilbert scheme. If the pullback square is not unique, then the family is only '''versal'''.\n\n== Deformations of germs of analytic algebras ==\nOne of the useful and readily computatable areas of deformation theory comes from the deformation theory of germs of complex spaces, such as [[Stein manifold|stein manifolds]], [[Complex manifold|complex manifolds]], or [[Complex analytic variety|complex analytic varieties]]<ref name=\":0\" />. Note that this theory can be '''globalized''' to complex manifolds and complex analytic spaces by considering the sheaves of germs of holomorphic functions, tangent spaces, etc. Such algebras are of the form<blockquote><math>A \\cong \\frac{\\mathbb{C}\\{z_1,\\ldots, z_n\\}}{I}</math> </blockquote>where <math>\\mathbb{C}\\{z_1,\\ldots,z_n \\}</math> is the ring of convergent power-series and <math>I</math> is an ideal. For example, many authors study the germs of functions of a singularity, such as the algebra<blockquote><math>A \\cong \\frac{\\mathbb{C}\\{z_1,\\ldots,z_n\\}}{(y^2 - x^n)}</math></blockquote>representing a plane-curve singularity. A '''germ of analytic algebras''' is then an object in the opposite category of such algebras. Then, a '''deformation''' of a germ of analytic algebras <math>X_0</math> is given by a flat map of germs of analytic algebras <math>f:X \\to S</math> where <math>S</math> has a distinguished point <math>0</math> such that the <math>X_0</math> fits into the pullback square<blockquote><math>\\begin{matrix}\nX_0 & \\to & X \\\\\n\\downarrow & & \\downarrow \\\\\n* & \\xrightarrow[0]{} & S\n\\end{matrix}</math></blockquote>These deformations have an equivalence relation given by commutative squares<blockquote><math>\\begin{matrix}\nX'& \\to & X \\\\\n\\downarrow & & \\downarrow \\\\\nS' & \\to & S\n\\end{matrix}</math></blockquote>where the horizontal arrows are isomorphisms. For example, there is a deformation of the plane curve singularity given by the opposite diagram of the commutative diagram of analytic algebras<blockquote><math>\\begin{matrix}\n\\frac{\\mathbb {C} \\{x,y\\}}{(y^{2}-x^{n})} & \\leftarrow & \\frac{\\mathbb {C} \\{x,y, s\\}}{(y^{2}-x^{n} + s)} \\\\\n\\uparrow & & \\uparrow \\\\\n\\mathbb{C} & \\leftarrow & \\mathbb{C}\\{s\\}\n\\end{matrix}</math></blockquote>In fact, Milnor studied such deformations, where a singularity is deformed by a constant, hence the fiber over a non-zero <math>s</math> is called the '''Milnor fiber'''.\n\n=== Cohomological Interpretation of deformations ===\nIt should be clear there could be many deformations of a single germ of analytic functions. Because of this, there are some book-keeping devices required to organize all of this information. These organizational devices are constructed using tangent cohomology<ref name=\":0\" />. This is formed by using the [[Koszul\u2013Tate resolution]], and potentially modifying it by adding additional generators for non-regular algebras <math>A</math>. In the case of analytic algebras these resolutions are called the '''Tjurina resolution''' for the mathematician who first studied such objects. This is a graded-commutative differential graded algebra <math>(R_\\bullet, s)</math> such that <math>R_0 \\to A</math> is a surjective map of analytic algebras, and this map fits into an exact sequence<blockquote><math>\\cdots \\xrightarrow{s} R_{-2} \\xrightarrow{s} R_{-1} \\xrightarrow{s} R_0 \\xrightarrow{p} A \\to 0</math></blockquote>Then, by taking the differential graded module of derivations <math>(\\text{Der}(R_\\bullet), d)</math>, its cohomology forms the '''tangent cohomology''' of the germ of analytic algebras <math>A</math>. These cohomology groups are denoted <math>T^k(A)</math>. The <math>T^1(A)</math> contains information about all of the deformations of <math>A</math> and can be readily computed using the exact sequence<blockquote><math>0 \\to T^0(A) \\to \\text{Der}(R_0) \\xrightarrow{d} \\text{Hom}_{R_0}(I,A) \\to T^1(A) \\to 0</math></blockquote>If <math>A</math> is isomorphic to the algebra<blockquote><math>\\frac{\\mathbb{C}\\{z_1,\\ldots,z_n\\}}{(f_1,\\ldots, f_m)}</math></blockquote>then its deformations are equal to<blockquote><math>T^1(A) \\cong \\frac{A^m}{df \\cdot A^n}</math></blockquote>were <math>df</math> is the jacobian matrix of <math>f = (f_1,\\ldots, f_m): \\mathbb{C}^n \\to \\mathbb{C}^m</math>. For example, the deformations of a hypersurface given by <math>f</math> has the deformations<blockquote><math>T^1(A) \\cong \\frac{A^n}{\\left( \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z_1}, \\ldots, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z_n} \\right)}</math></blockquote>For the singularity <math>y^2 - x^3</math> this is the module<blockquote><math>\\frac{A^2}{(y, x^2)}</math></blockquote>hence the only deformations are given by adding constants or linear factors, so a general deformation of <math>y^2 - x^3</math> is <math>y^2 - x^3 + a_1 + a_2x </math> where <math>a_i</math> are constants. \n\n==Functorial description==\nAnother method for formalizing deformation theory is using functors on the category <math>\\text{Art}_k</math> of local Artin algebras over a field. A '''pre-deformation functor''' is defined as a functor\n:<math>F: \\text{Art}_k \\to \\text{Sets}</math>\nsuch that <math>F(k)</math> is a point. The idea is that we want to study the infinitesimal structure of some [[moduli space]] around a point where lying above that point is the space of interest. It is typically the case that it is easier to describe the functor for a moduli problem instead of finding an actual space. For example, if we want to consider the moduli-space of hypersurfaces of degree <math>d</math> in <math>\\mathbb{P}^n</math>, then we could consider the functor\n:<math>F: \\text{Sch} \\to \\text{Sets}</math>\nwhere\n:<math>\nF(S) = \\left\\{\n\\begin{matrix}\nX \\\\\n\\downarrow \\\\\nS\n\\end{matrix}\n: \\text{ each fiber is a degree } d \\text{ hypersurface in }\\mathbb{P}^n\\right\\}\n</math>\n\nAlthough in general, it is more convenient/required to work with functors of [[groupoid|groupoids]] instead of sets. This is true for moduli of curves.\n\n===Technical remarks about infinitesimals===\nInfinitesimals have long been in use by mathematicians for non-rigorous arguments in calculus. The idea is that if we consider polynomials <math>F(x,\\varepsilon)</math> with an infinitesimal <math>\\varepsilon</math>, then only the first order terms really matter; that is, we can consider\n:<math> F(x,\\varepsilon) \\equiv f(x) + \\varepsilon g(x) + O(\\varepsilon^2)</math>\nA simple application of this is that we can find the derivatives of [[monomial|monomials]] using infinitesimals:\n:<math> (x+\\varepsilon)^3 = x^3 + 3x^2\\varepsilon + O(\\varepsilon^2)</math>\nthe <math>\\varepsilon</math> term contains the derivative of the monomial, demonstrating its use in calculus. We could also interpret this equation as the first two terms of the Taylor expansion of the monomial. Infinitesimals can be made rigorous using nilpotent elements in local artin algebras. In the ring <math>k[y]/(y^2)</math> we see that arguments with infinitesimals can work. This motivates the notation <math>k[\\varepsilon] = k[y]/(y^2)</math>, which is called the [[Ring of dual numbers]]. \n\nMoreover, if we want to consider higher-order terms of a taylor approximation then we could consider the artin algebras <math>k[y]/(y^k)</math>. For our monomial, suppose we want to write out the second order expansion, then\n:<math>(x+\\varepsilon)^3 = x^3 + 3x^2\\varepsilon + 3x\\varepsilon^2 + \\varepsilon^3</math>\nRecall that a Taylor expansion (at zero) can be written out as\n:<math>f(x) = f(0) + \\frac{f^{(1)}(x)}{1!} + \\frac{f^{(2)}(x)}{2!} + \\frac{f^{(3)}(x)}{3!} + \\cdots </math>\nhence the previous two equations show that the second derivative of <math>x^3</math> is <math>6x</math>.\n\nIn general, since we want to consider arbitrary order Taylor expansions in any number of variables, we will consider the category of all local artin algebras over a field.\n\n===Motivation===\nTo motivative the definition of a pre-deformation functor, consider the projective hypersurface over a field\n:<math>\n\\begin{matrix}\n\\operatorname{Proj}\\left( \\dfrac{\\mathbb{C}[x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3]}{(x_0^4 + x_1^4 + x_2^4 + x_3^4)} \\right) \\\\\n\\downarrow \\\\\n\\operatorname{Spec}(k)\n\\end{matrix}\n</math>\nIf we want to consider an infinitesimal deformation of this space, then we could write down a Cartesian square\n:<math>\n\\begin{matrix}\n\\operatorname{Proj}\\left( \\dfrac{\\mathbb{C}[x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3]}{(x_0^4 + x_1^4 + x_2^4 + x_3^4)} \\right) & \\to & \\operatorname{Proj}\\left( \\dfrac{ \\mathbb{C}[x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3][\\varepsilon]}{(x_0^4 + x_1^4 + x_2^4 + x_3^4 + \\varepsilon  x_0^{a_0} x_1^{a_1} x_2^{a_2} x_3^{a_3}) } \\right) \\\\\n\\downarrow & & \\downarrow\\\\\n\\operatorname{Spec}(k) & \\to & \\operatorname{Spec}(k[\\varepsilon])\n\\end{matrix}\n</math>\nwhere <math>a_0 + a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 4</math>. Then, the space on the right hand corner is one example of an infinitesimal deformation: the extra scheme theoretic structure of the nilpotent elements in <math>\\operatorname{Spec}(k[\\varepsilon])</math> (which is topologically a point) allows us to organize this infinitesimal data. Since we want to consider all possible expansions, we will let our predeformation functor be defined on objects as\n:<math>\nF(A) = \\left\\{\n\\begin{matrix}\n\\operatorname{Proj}\\left( \\dfrac{\\mathbb{C}[x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3]}{(x_0^4 + x_1^4 + x_2^4 + x_3^4)} \\right) & \\to & \\mathfrak{X} \\\\\n\\downarrow & & \\downarrow \\\\\n\\operatorname{Spec}(k) & \\to & \\operatorname{Spec}(A)\n\\end{matrix}\n\\right\\}\n</math>\nwhere <math>A</math> is a local Artin <math>k</math>-algebra.\n\n===Smooth pre-deformation functors===\nA pre-deformation functor is called '''smooth''' if for any surjection <math>A' \\to A</math> such that the square of any element in the kernel is zero, there is a surjection\n:<math>F(A') \\to F(A)</math>\nThis is motivated by the following question: given a deformation\n:<math>\n\\begin{matrix}\nX & \\to & \\mathfrak{X} \\\\\n\\downarrow & & \\downarrow \\\\\n\\operatorname{Spec}(k) & \\to & \\operatorname{Spec}(A)\n\\end{matrix}\n</math>\ndoes there exist an extension of this cartesian diagram to the cartesian diagrams\n:<math>\n\\begin{matrix}\nX & \\to & \\mathfrak{X} & \\to & \\mathfrak{X}' \\\\\n\\downarrow & & \\downarrow & & \\downarrow \\\\\n\\operatorname{Spec}(k) & \\to & \\operatorname{Spec}(A) & \\to & \\operatorname{Spec}(A')\n\\end{matrix}\n</math>\nthe name smooth comes from the lifting criterion of a smooth morphism of schemes.\n\n===Tangent space===\nRecall that the tangent space of a scheme <math>X</math> can be described as the <math>\\operatorname{Hom}</math>-set\n:<math>TX := \\operatorname{Hom}_{\\text{Sch}/k}(\\operatorname{Spec}(k[\\varepsilon]),X)</math>\n\nwhere the source is the ring of [[Dual number#Dual numbers over an arbitrary ring|dual numbers]]. Since we are considering the tangent space of a point of some moduli space, we can define the tangent space of our (pre)-deformation functor as\n:<math>T_F := F(k[\\varepsilon])</math>\n\n== Applications of deformation theory ==\n\n=== Dimension of moduli of curves ===\nOne of the first properties of the [[moduli of algebraic curves]] <math>\\mathcal{M}_g</math> can be deduced using elementary deformation theory. Its dimension can be computed as<blockquote><math>\\dim(\\mathcal{M}_g) = \\dim H^1(C,T_C)</math></blockquote>for an arbitrary smooth curve of genus <math>g</math> because the deformation space is the tangent space of the moduli space. Using [[Serre duality]] the tangent space is isomorphic to<blockquote><math>\\begin{align}\nH^1(C,T_C) &\\cong H^0(C,T_C^* \\otimes \\omega_C)^\\vee \\\\\n&\\cong H^0(C,\\omega_C^{\\otimes 2})^\\vee\n\\end{align}</math></blockquote>Hence the [[Riemann\u2013Roch theorem]] gives<blockquote><math>\\begin{align}\nh^0(C,\\omega_C^{\\otimes 2}) - h^1(C,\\omega_C^{\\otimes 2}) &= 2(2g - 2) - g - 1 \\\\\n &= 3g - 3\n\\end{align}</math></blockquote>For curves of genus <math>g \\geq 2</math> the <math>h^1(C,\\omega_C^{\\otimes 2}) = 0</math> because<blockquote><math>h^1(C,\\omega_C^{\\otimes 2}) = h^0(C, (\\omega_C^{\\otimes 2})^{\\vee}\\otimes \\omega_C)\n</math></blockquote>the degree is<blockquote><math>\\begin{align}\n\\text{deg}((\\omega_C^{\\otimes 2})^\\vee \\otimes \\omega_C) &= 4 - 4g + 2g - 2  \\\\\n&= 2 - 2g\n\\end{align}</math></blockquote>and <math>h^0(L) = 0</math> for line bundles of negative degree. Therefore the dimension of the moduli space is <math>3g - 3</math>.\n\n=== Bend-and-break ===\nDeformation theory was famously applied in [[birational geometry]] by [[Shigefumi Mori]] to study the existence of [[rational curve]]s on [[algebraic variety|varieties]].<ref>{{cite book| first=Olivier|last = Debarre | author-link = Olivier Debarre|  title = Higher-Dimensional Algebraic Geometry|year = 2001 | publisher= Springer| chapter = 3. Bend-and-Break Lemmas | series = Universitext}}</ref> For a [[Fano variety]] of positive dimension Mori showed that there is a rational curve passing through every point. The method of the proof later became known as '''Mori's bend-and-break'''. The rough idea is to start with some curve ''C'' through a chosen point and keep deforming it until it breaks into several [[irreducible component|components]]. Replacing ''C'' by one of the components has the effect of decreasing either the   [[genus of a curve|genus]] or the [[degree of an algebraic variety|degree]] of ''C''. So after several repetitions of the procedure, eventually we'll obtain a curve of genus 0, i.e. a rational curve. The existence and the properties of deformations of ''C'' require arguments from deformation theory and a reduction to [[positive characteristic]].\n\n===Arithmetic deformations===\nOne of the major applications of deformation theory is in arithmetic. It can be used to answer the following question: if we have a variety <math>X/\\mathbb{F}_p</math>, what are the possible extensions <math>\\mathfrak{X}/\\mathbb{Z}_p</math>? If our variety is a curve, then the vanishing <math>H^2</math> implies that every deformation induces a variety over <math>\\mathbb{Z}_p</math>; that is, if we have a smooth curve\n:<math>\n\\begin{matrix}\nX \\\\\n\\downarrow \\\\\n\\operatorname{Spec}(\\mathbb{F}_p)\n\\end{matrix}\n</math>\nand a deformation\n:<math>\n\\begin{matrix}\nX & \\to & \\mathfrak{X}_2 \\\\\n\\downarrow & & \\downarrow \\\\\n\\operatorname{Spec}(\\mathbb{F}_p) & \\to & \\operatorname{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z}/(p^2))\n\\end{matrix}\n</math>\nthen we can always extend it to a diagram of the form\n:<math>\n\\begin{matrix}\nX & \\to & \\mathfrak{X}_2 & \\to & \\mathfrak{X}_3 & \\to \\cdots \\\\\n\\downarrow & & \\downarrow & & \\downarrow &  \\\\\n\\operatorname{Spec}(\\mathbb{F}_p) & \\to & \\operatorname{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z}/(p^2)) & \\to & \\operatorname{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z}/(p^3)) & \\to \\cdots\n\\end{matrix}\n</math>\n\nThis implies that we can construct a [[formal scheme]] <math>\\mathfrak{X} = \\operatorname{Spet}(\\mathfrak{X}_\\bullet)</math> giving a curve over <math>\\mathbb{Z}_p</math>.\n=== Deformations of abelian schemes ===\n\nThe [[Serre\u2013Tate theorem]] asserts, roughly speaking, that the deformations of [[abelian variety|abelian scheme]] ''A'' is controlled by deformations of the [[p-divisible group|''p''-divisible group]] <math>A[p^\\infty]</math> consisting of its ''p''-power torsion points.\n\n=== Galois deformations ===\nAnother application of deformation theory is with Galois deformations. It allows us to answer the question: If we have a Galois representation\n:<math>G \\to \\operatorname{GL}_n(\\mathbb{F}_p)</math>\nhow can we extend it to a representation\n:<math>G \\to \\operatorname{GL}_n(\\mathbb{Z}_p) \\text{?}</math>\n\n==Relationship to string theory==\nThe so-called [[Deligne conjecture]] arising in the context of algebras (and [[Hochschild cohomology]]) stimulated much interest in deformation theory in relation to [[string theory]] (roughly speaking, to formalise the idea that a string theory can be regarded as a deformation of a point-particle theory). This is now accepted as proved, after some hitches with early announcements. [[Maxim Kontsevich]] is among those who have offered a generally accepted proof of this.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Dual number]]\n*[[Exalcomm]]\n* [[Cotangent complex]]\n* [[Gromov\u2013Witten invariant]]\n* [[Moduli of algebraic curves]]\n* [[Degeneration (algebraic geometry)]]\n\n==References==\n===Pedagogical===\n*Palamodov, V.

F45 is one of the fastest-growing fitness franchises, with over 1,750 studios in 45+ countries across Australia/Oceania, North America, South America, Asia, Europe and Africa. It was founded in Sydney, Australia in 2012. \n\n== About ==\nThe 'F' in F45 stands for functional training, and the '45' stands for the length in minutes of each group training session. F45's workout database contains thousands of exercises and 36 unique workouts that change on a daily basis, which ensures members rarely take the same class twice. \n\nIntegrated technology is a key aspect of the systematic aesthetic. On-screen F45TV workout demonstrations, curated F45FM playlists, and F45 LionHeart heart rate tracking are consistent across all studios and fuel F45's in-studio workouts.\n\nThe motivation and encouragement in F45's group training facilities create a pulsing, upbeat environment where goals are met and exceeded. Communities promoting fitness, good health and growth are forged in studios around the world and are the source of F45's strength as an international brand.\n\nThe fusion of interval, strength and cardiovascular training is designed to get members the best results possible. Aside from in-studio training, F45 also runs a 45-day Challenge multiple times throughout the year. The [https://f45challenge.com/ F45 Challenge] gives members access to a personalized nutrition program to achieve their goals with daily meal plans, tracking, and community support.\n\n== Corporate History ==\nF45 was founded in Sydney, Australia in 2012 by Rob Deutsch. Deutsch identified a gap in the fitness market\u2014there was no affordable gym that provided both personal and group training. He set out to create a community-based gym that combined the best of both worlds.\n\nDeutsch opened the first studio in Paddington, Sydney and shortly after, partnered with Adam Gilchrist to further develop franchise operations. In 2013, the pair sold their first franchise, which generated a lot of traction in Sydney. In 2015, they told their first off-shore franchise in New Zealand and hit a milestone of 250 franchises.

It was founded in Sydney, Australia in 2012. \n\n== About ==\nThe 'F' in F45 stands for functional training, and the '45' stands for the length in minutes of each group training session. F45's workout database contains thousands of exercises and 36 unique workouts that change on a daily basis, which ensures members rarely take the same class twice. \n\nIntegrated technology is a key aspect of the systematic aesthetic. On-screen F45TV workout demonstrations, curated F45FM playlists, and F45 LionHeart heart rate tracking are consistent across all studios and fuel F45's in-studio workouts.\n\nThe motivation and encouragement in F45's group training facilities create a pulsing, upbeat environment where goals are met and exceeded. Communities promoting fitness, good health and growth are forged in studios around the world and are the source of F45's strength as an international brand.\n\nThe fusion of interval, strength and cardiovascular training is designed to get members the best results possible. Aside from in-studio training, F45 also runs a 45-day Challenge multiple times throughout the year. The [https://f45challenge.com/ F45 Challenge] gives members access to a personalized nutrition program to achieve their goals with daily meal plans, tracking, and community support.\n\n== Corporate History ==\nF45 was founded in Sydney, Australia in 2012 by Rob Deutsch. Deutsch identified a gap in the fitness market\u2014there was no affordable gym that combined both personal and group training community-driven gym that incorporated both personal and group training. He set out to create something that combined the best of both worlds, while also building a community.\n\nDeutsch opened the first studio in Paddington, Sydney and shortly after, partnered with Adam Gilchrist to further develop franchise operations.

This makes it impossible to obtain exact figures from primary sources. The best that can be done is to estimate based on secondary sources, such as UN investigations, newspaper articles, government reports, and figures from [[NGO]]s.<ref name=\"NRC\"/> Modern slavery persists for many of the same reasons older variations did: it is an economically beneficial practice despite the ethical concerns. The problem has been able to escalate in recent years due to the ''disposability'' of slaves and the fact that the cost of slaves has dropped significantly.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://thecnnfreedomproject.blogs.cnn.com/2011/03/07/cost-of-slaves-falls-to-historic-low/|title=Cost of slaves falls to historic low|last=|first=|date=7 March 2011|work=CNN Freedom Project|access-date=24 October 2019|publisher=[[CNN]]}}</ref>\n\n== Causes ==\nSince slavery has been officially abolished, enslavement no longer revolves around legal ownership, but around illegal control. Two fundamental changes are the move away from the forward purchase of slave labour, and the existence of slaves as an employment category. While the statistics suggest that the 'market' for exploitative labour is booming, the notion that humans are purposefully sold and bought from an existing pool is outdated. While such basic transactions do still occur, in contemporary cases people become trapped in slavery-like conditions in various ways.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=3humDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Addressing Modern Slavery (Sydney: UNSW Press, 2019)|access-date=2020-02-01}}</ref> \n\nModern slavery is often seen as a by-product of [[poverty]]. Countries that lack education, economic freedom, the rule of law, [[Anarchy|anarchy]] and poor societal structure can create an environment that fosters the acceptance and propagation of slavery. Slavery is most prevalent in impoverished countries and those with vulnerable minority communities, though it also exists in developed countries. Tens of thousands toil in slave-like conditions in industries such as mining, farming, and factories, producing goods for domestic consumption or export to more prosperous nations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cfr.org/interactives/modern-slavery|title=Modern Slavery: Its Root Causes and the Human Toll|website=Council on Foreign Relations|access-date=2019-05-13}}</ref> \n\nIn the older form of slavery, slave-owners spent more on getting slaves. It was more difficult for them to be disposed of. The cost of keeping them healthy was considered a better investment than getting another slave to replace them. In modern slavery people are easier to get at a lower price so replacing them when exploiters run into problems becomes easier. Slaves are then used in areas where they could easily be hidden while also creating a profit for the exploiter. Slaves are more attractive for unpleasant work, and less for pleasant work. \n\nModern slavery can be quite profitable<ref>Siddarth Kara, Sex Trafficking: Inside the Business of Modern Slavery (New York: Columbia University Press, 2010).</ref> and corrupt governments tacitly allow it, despite it being outlawed by international treaties such as [[Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery]] and local laws.

In chattel slavery, the enslaved person is considered the [[personal property]] (chattel) of someone else, and can usually be bought and sold. It stems historically either from conquest, where a conquered person is enslaved, as in the [[Slavery in ancient Rome|Roman Empire]] or [[Slavery in the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Empire]], or from slave raiding, as in the [[Atlantic slave trade]] or [[Arab slave trade]]. In the 21st Century, almost every country has legally abolished chattel slavery, but the number of people currently enslaved around the world is far greater than the number of slaves during the historical Atlantic slave trade.\n\nSince the [[Libyan Civil War (2014\u2013present)|2014 Civil War]] in [[Libya]], and the subsequent breakdown of law and order, there have been reports of enslaved migrants being sold in public, open slave markets in the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/10/libya-public-slave-auctions-un-migration|title=Migrants from west Africa being 'sold in Libyan slave markets'|first=Emma|last=Graham-Harrison|date=10 April 2017|website=the Guardian}}</ref>\n\n[[Mauritania]] has a [[Slavery in Mauritania|long history with slavery]]. Chattel slavery was formally made illegal in the country but the laws against it have gone largely unenforced. It is estimated that around 90,000 people (over 2% of Mauritania's population) are slaves.

This makes it impossible to obtain exact figures from primary sources. The best that can be done is to estimate based on secondary sources, such as UN investigations, newspaper articles, government reports, and figures from [[NGO]]s.<ref name=\"NRC\"/> Modern slavery persists for many of the same reasons older variations did: it is an economically beneficial practice despite the ethical concerns. The problem has been able to escalate in recent years due to the ''disposability'' of slaves and the fact that the cost of slaves has dropped significantly.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://thecnnfreedomproject.blogs.cnn.com/2011/03/07/cost-of-slaves-falls-to-historic-low/|title=Cost of slaves falls to historic low|last=|first=|date=7 March 2011|work=CNN Freedom Project|access-date=24 October 2019|publisher=[[CNN]]}}</ref>\n\n== Causes ==\nSince slavery has been officially abolished, enslavement no longer revolves around legal ownership, but around illegal control. Two fundamental changes are the move away from the forward purchase of slave labour, and the existence of slaves as an employment category. While the statistics suggest that the 'market' for exploitative labour is booming, the notion that humans are purposefully sold and bought from an existing pool is outdated. While such basic transactions do still occur, in contemporary cases people become trapped in slavery-like conditions in various ways.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=3humDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Addressing Modern Slavery (Sydney: UNSW Press, 2019)|access-date=2020-02-01}}</ref> \n\nModern slavery is often seen as a by-product of [[poverty]]. Countries that lack education, economic freedom, the rule of law, [[Anarchy|anarchy]] and poor societal structure can create an environment that fosters the acceptance and propagation of slavery. Slavery is most prevalent in impoverished countries and those with vulnerable minority communities, though it also exists in developed countries. Tens of thousands toil in slave-like conditions in industries such as mining, farming, and factories, producing goods for domestic consumption or export to more prosperous nations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cfr.org/interactives/modern-slavery|title=Modern Slavery: Its Root Causes and the Human Toll|website=Council on Foreign Relations|access-date=2019-05-13}}</ref> \n\nIn the older form of slavery, slave-owners spent more on getting slaves. It was more difficult for them to be disposed of. The cost of keeping them healthy was considered a better investment than getting another slave to replace them. In modern slavery people are easier to get at a lower price so replacing them when exploiters run into problems becomes easier. Slaves are then used in areas where they could easily be hidden while also creating a profit for the exploiter. Slaves are more attractive for unpleasant work, and less for pleasant work. \n\nModern slavery can be quite profitable<ref>Siddarth Kara, Sex Trafficking: Inside the Business of Modern Slavery (New York: Columbia University Press, 2010).</ref> and corrupt governments tacitly allow it, despite it being outlawed by international treaties such as [[Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery]] and local laws.

In chattel slavery, the enslaved person is considered the [[personal property]] (chattel) of someone else, and can usually be bought and sold. It stems historically either from conquest, where a conquered person is enslaved, as in the [[Slavery in ancient Rome|Roman Empire]] or [[Slavery in the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Empire]], or from slave raiding, as in the [[Atlantic slave trade]] or [[Arab slave trade]]. In the 21st Century, almost every country has legally abolished chattel slavery, but the number of people currently enslaved around the world is far greater than the number of slaves during the historical Atlantic slave trade.\n\nSince the [[Libyan Civil War (2014\u2013present)|2014 Civil War]] in [[Libya]], and the subsequent breakdown of law and order, there have been reports of enslaved migrants being sold in public, open slave markets in the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/10/libya-public-slave-auctions-un-migration|title=Migrants from west Africa being 'sold in Libyan slave markets'|first=Emma|last=Graham-Harrison|date=10 April 2017|website=the Guardian}}</ref>\n\n[[Mauritania]] has a [[Slavery in Mauritania|long history with slavery]]. Chattel slavery was formally made illegal in the country but the laws against it have gone largely unenforced.

The standard [[Floating-point arithmetic#IEEE 754 design rationale|addressed many problems]] found in the diverse floating-point implementations that made them difficult to use reliably and [[Software portability|portably]]. Many hardware [[floating-point unit]]s use the IEEE 754 standard.\n\nThe standard defines:\n* ''arithmetic formats:'' sets of [[Binary code|binary]] and [[decimal]] floating-point data, which consist of finite numbers (including [[signed zero]]s and [[subnormal number]]s), [[infinity|infinities]], and special \"not a number\" values ([[NaN]]s)\n* ''interchange formats:'' encodings (bit strings) that may be used to exchange floating-point data in an efficient and compact form\n* ''rounding rules:'' properties to be satisfied when rounding numbers during arithmetic and conversions\n* ''operations:'' arithmetic and other operations (such as [[trigonometric functions]]) on arithmetic formats\n* ''exception handling:'' indications of exceptional conditions (such as [[division by zero]], overflow, ''etc.'')\n\n[[IEEE 754-2008 revision|IEEE 754-2008]], published in August 2008, includes nearly all of the original [[IEEE 754-1985]] standard, plus the [[IEEE 854-1987|IEEE 854-1987 Standard for Radix-Independent Floating-Point Arithmetic]].  {{anchor|2019}}The current version, IEEE 754-2019, was published in July 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://standards.ieee.org/content/ieee-standards/en/standard/754-2019.html|title=IEEE 754-2019 - IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic|website=standards.ieee.org|accessdate=23 July 2019}}</ref> It is a minor revision of the previous version, incorporating mainly clarifications, defect fixes and new recommended operations.\n\n==Standard development==\nThe first standard for floating-point arithmetic, [[IEEE 754-1985]], was published in 1985. It covered only binary floating-point arithmetic.\n\nA new version, [[IEEE 754-2008 revision|IEEE 754-2008]], was published in August 2008, following a seven-year revision process, chaired by Dan Zuras and edited by [[Mike Cowlishaw]].

The binary formats in the original standard are included in this new standard along with three new basic formats, one binary and two decimal.  To conform to the current standard, an implementation must implement at least one of the basic formats as both an arithmetic format and an interchange format.\n\nThe international standard '''ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559:2011''' (with content identical to IEEE 754-2008) has been approved for adoption through [[ISO/IEC JTC1|JTC1]]/SC 25 under the ISO/IEEE PSDO Agreement<ref>{{cite web|url=http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/754/email/msg04167.html|title=FW: ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559 (IEEE Std 754-2008)|website=grouper.ieee.org|accessdate=4 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027190846/http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/754/email/msg04167.html|archive-date=2017-10-27}}</ref> and published.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=57469|title=ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559:2011 - Information technology -- Microprocessor Systems -- Floating-Point arithmetic|website=www.iso.org|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe current version, IEEE 754-2019 published in July 2019, is derived from and replaces IEEE 754-2008, following a revision process started in September 2015, chaired by David G.

A format may also include how the set is encoded.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a72.1.27}}.</ref>\n\nA floating-point format is specified by:\n* a base (also called ''radix'') ''b'', which is either 2 (binary) or 10 (decimal) in IEEE 754;\n* a precision ''p'';\n* an exponent range from ''emin'' to ''emax'', with ''emin'' = 1 \u2212 ''emax'' for all IEEE 754 formats.\n\nA format comprises:\n* Finite numbers, which can be described by three integers: ''s''&nbsp;= a ''sign'' (zero or one), ''c''&nbsp;= a ''[[significand]]'' (or ''coefficient'') having no more than ''p'' digits when written in base ''b'' (i.e., an integer in the range through 0 to ''b''<sup>''p''</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1), and ''q''&nbsp;= an ''exponent'' such that ''emin'' \u2264 ''q''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''p''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 \u2264 ''emax''. The numerical value of such a finite number is {{nowrap|(\u22121)<sup>''s''</sup> \u00d7 ''c'' \u00d7 ''b''<sup>''q''</sup>}}.<ref group=\"lower-alpha\">For example, if the base is 10, the sign is 1 (indicating negative), the significand is 12345, and the exponent is \u22123, then the value of the number is {{nowrap|(\u22121)<sup>1</sup> \u00d7 12345 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22123</sup>}} = {{nowrap|\u22121 \u00d7 12345 \u00d7 0.001}} = \u221212.345.</ref> Moreover, there are two zero values, called [[signed zero]]s: the sign bit specifies whether a zero is +0 (positive zero) or \u22120 (negative zero).\n* Two infinities: +\u221e and \u2212\u221e.\n* Two kinds of [[NaN]] (not-a-number): a quiet NaN (qNaN) and a signaling NaN (sNaN).\n\nFor example, if ''b'' = 10, ''p'' = 7, and ''emax'' = 96, then ''emin'' = \u221295, the significand satisfies 0 \u2264 ''c'' \u2264 {{val|9999999}}, and the exponent satisfies \u2212101 \u2264 ''q'' \u2264 90. Consequently, the smallest non-zero positive number that can be represented is 1\u00d710<sup>\u2212101</sup>, and the largest is 9999999\u00d710<sup>90</sup> (9.999999\u00d710<sup>96</sup>), so the full range of numbers is \u22129.999999\u00d710<sup>96</sup> through 9.999999\u00d710<sup>96</sup>. The numbers \u2212''b''<sup>1\u2212''emax''</sup> and ''b''<sup>1\u2212''emax''</sup> (here, \u22121\u00d710<sup>\u221295</sup> and 1\u00d710<sup>\u221295</sup>) are the smallest (in magnitude) ''normal numbers''; non-zero numbers between these smallest numbers are called [[subnormal number]]s.\n\n=== Representation and encoding in memory ===\nSome numbers may have several possible exponential format representations. For instance, if ''b''\u00a0=\u00a010, and ''p''\u00a0=\u00a07, then \u221212.345 can be represented by \u221212345\u00d710<sup>\u22123</sup>, \u2212123450\u00d710<sup>\u22124</sup>, and \u22121234500\u00d710<sup>\u22125</sup>. However, for most operations, such as arithmetic operations, the result (value) does not depend on the representation of the inputs.\n\nFor the decimal formats, any representation is valid, and the set of these representations is called a ''cohort''. When a result can have several representations, the standard specifies which member of the cohort is chosen.\n\nFor the binary formats, the representation is made unique by choosing the smallest representable exponent allowing the value to be represented exactly. Further, the exponent is not represented directly, but a bias is added so that the smallest representable exponent is represented as 1, with 0 used for subnormal numbers. For numbers with an exponent in the normal range (the exponent field being not all ones or all zeros), the leading bit of the significand will always be 1. Consequently, a leading 1 can be implied rather than explicitly present in the memory encoding, and under the standard the explicitly represented part of the significand will lie between 0 and 1. This rule is called ''leading bit convention'', ''implicit bit convention'', or ''hidden bit convention''. This rule allows the binary format to have an extra bit of precision. The leading bit convention cannot be used for the subnormal numbers as they have an exponent outside the normal exponent range and scale by the smallest represented exponent as used for the smallest normal numbers.\n\nDue to the possibility of multiple encodings (at least in formats called ''interchange formats''), a NaN may carry other information: a sign bit (which has no meaning, but may be used by some operations) and a ''payload'', which is intended for diagnostic information indicating the source of the NaN (but the payload may have other uses, such as ''NaN-boxing''<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/SpiderMonkey/Internals |title=SpiderMonkey Internals |website=developer.mozilla.org |accessdate=11 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last1=Klemens |first1=Ben |title=21st Century C: C Tips from the New School |date=September 2014 |publisher=O'Reilly Media, Incorporated |page=160 |url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=ASuiBAAAQBAJ |accessdate=11 March 2018|isbn=9781491904442 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://github.com/zuiderkwast/nanbox |title=zuiderkwast/nanbox: NaN-boxing in C |website=[[GitHub]] |accessdate=11 March 2018}}</ref>).\n\n=== Basic and interchange formats ===\n\nThe standard defines five basic formats that are named for their numeric base and the number of bits used in their interchange encoding. There are three binary floating-point basic formats (encoded with 32, 64 or 128 bits) and two decimal floating-point basic formats (encoded with 64 or 128 bits). The [[binary32]] and [[binary64]] formats are the ''single'' and ''double'' formats of [[IEEE 754-1985]] respectively. A conforming implementation must fully implement at least one of the basic formats.\n\nThe standard also defines ''[[#Interchange formats|interchange formats]]'', which generalize these basic formats.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a73.6}}.</ref> For the binary formats, the leading bit convention is required.

For example, the smallest positive number that can be represented in binary64 is 2<sup>\u22121074</sup>; contributions to the \u22121074 figure include the E&nbsp;min value \u22121022 and all but one of the 53 significand bits (2<sup>\u22121022&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;(53&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1)</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2<sup>\u22121074</sup>).\n\nDecimal digits is ''digits'' \u00d7 log<sub>10</sub> ''base''. This gives an approximate precision in number of decimal digits.\n\nDecimal E max is ''Emax'' \u00d7 log<sub>10</sub> ''base''. This gives an approximate value of the maximum decimal exponent.\n\nThe binary32 (single) and binary64 (double) formats are two of the most common formats used today. The figure below shows the absolute precision for both formats over a range of values. This figure can be used to select an appropriate format given the expected value of a number and the required precision.\n\n[[File:IEEE754.svg|thumb|none|frame|550px|Precision of binary32 and binary64 in the range 10<sup>\u221212</sup> to 10<sup>12</sup>]]\n\n\nAn example of a layout for [[Single-precision floating-point format|32-bit floating point]] is\n[[File:Float example.svg|none]]\n \nand the [[Double-precision floating-point format|64 bit layout is similar]].\n\n=== Extended and extendable precision formats ===\nThe standard specifies optional [[Extended precision|extended]] and extendable precision formats, which provide greater precision than the basic formats.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a73.7}}.</ref> An extended precision format extends a basic format by using more precision and more exponent range. An extendable precision format allows the user to specify the precision and exponent range. An implementation may use whatever internal representation it chooses for such formats; all that needs to be defined are its parameters (''b'', ''p'', and ''emax''). These parameters uniquely describe the set of finite numbers (combinations of sign, significand, and exponent for the given radix) that it can represent.\n\nThe standard recommends that language standards provide a method of specifying ''p'' and ''emax'' for each supported base ''b''.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a73.7}} states: \"Language standards should define mechanisms supporting extendable precision for each supported radix.\"</ref><!-- extendable recommendation does not apply to \"implementations\". --> The standard recommends that language standards and implementations support an extended format which has a greater precision than the largest basic format supported for each radix ''b''.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a73.7}} states: \"Language standards or implementations should support an extended precision format that extends the widest basic format that is supported in that radix.\"</ref> For an extended format with a precision between two basic formats the exponent range must be as great as that of the next wider basic format. So for instance a 64-bit extended precision binary number must have an 'emax' of at least 16383. The [[x87]] [[Extended precision#x86 extended precision format|80-bit extended format]] meets this requirement.\n\n=== Interchange formats ===\nInterchange formats are intended for the exchange of floating-point data using a bit string of fixed length for a given format. \n\n====Binary====\nFor the exchange of binary floating-point numbers, interchange formats of length 16 bits, 32 bits, 64 bits, and any multiple of 32 bits \u2265 128<ref group=\"lower-alpha\">Contrary to decimal, there is no binary interchange format of 96-bit length. Such a format is still allowed as a non-interchange format, though.</ref> are defined.  The 16-bit format is intended for the exchange or storage of small numbers (e.g., for graphics).\n\nThe encoding scheme for these binary interchange formats is the same as that of IEEE 754-1985: a sign bit, followed by ''w'' exponent bits that describe the exponent offset by a ''[[Exponent bias|bias]]'', and ''p''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 bits that describe the significand.  The width of the exponent field for a ''k''-bit format is computed as ''w''&nbsp;=&nbsp;round(4&nbsp;log<sub>2</sub>(''k''))&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;13.  The existing 64- and 128-bit formats follow this rule, but the 16- and 32-bit formats have more exponent bits (5 and 8 respectively) than this formula would provide (3 and 7 respectively).\n\nAs with IEEE 754-1985, the biased-exponent field is filled with all 1 bits to indicate either infinity (trailing significand field = 0) or a NaN (trailing significand field \u2260 0).  For NaNs, quiet NaNs and signaling NaNs are distinguished by using the most significant bit of the trailing significand field exclusively,{{efn|The standard recommends 0 for signaling NaNs, 1 for quiet NaNs, so that a signaling NaNs can be quieted by changing only this bit to 1, while the reverse could yield the encoding of an infinity.}} and the payload is carried in the remaining bits.\n\n====Decimal====\nFor the exchange of decimal floating-point numbers, interchange formats of any multiple of 32 bits are defined. As with binary interchange, the encoding scheme for the decimal interchange formats encodes the sign, exponent, and significand. Two different bit-level encodings are defined, and interchange is complicated by the fact that some external indicator of the encoding in use may be required.\n\nThe two options allow the significand to be encoded as a compressed sequence of decimal digits using [[densely packed decimal]] or, alternatively, as a [[Binary integer decimal|binary integer]].  The former is more convenient for direct hardware implementation of the standard, while the latter is more suited to software emulation on a binary computer.  In either case, the set of numbers (combinations of sign, significand, and exponent) that may be encoded is identical, and [[Floating point#Special values|special values]] (\u00b1zero with the minimum exponent, \u00b1infinity, quiet NaNs, and signaling NaNs) have identical encodings.\n\n== Rounding rules ==\nThe standard defines five rounding rules.  The first two rules round to a nearest value; the others are called ''[[directed rounding]]s'':\n\n=== Roundings to nearest ===\n* '''[[Rounding#Round half to even|Round to nearest, ties to even]]'''&nbsp;\u2013 rounds to the nearest value; if the number falls midway, it is rounded to the nearest value with an even least significant digit; this is the default for binary floating point and the recommended default for decimal.\n* '''[[Rounding#Round half away from zero|Round to nearest, ties away from zero]]'''&nbsp;\u2013 rounds to the nearest value; if the number falls midway, it is rounded to the nearest value above (for positive numbers) or below (for negative numbers); this is intended as an option for decimal floating point.\n\n=== Directed roundings ===\n* '''Round toward 0'''&nbsp;\u2013 directed rounding towards zero (also known as ''truncation'').\n* '''Round toward +\u221e'''&nbsp;\u2013 directed rounding towards positive infinity (also known as ''rounding up'' or ''ceiling'').\n* '''Round toward \u2212\u221e'''&nbsp;\u2013 directed rounding towards negative infinity (also known as ''rounding down'' or ''floor'').\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Example of rounding to integers using the IEEE 754 rules\n!rowspan=2| Mode ||colspan=4| Example value\n|-\n! +11.5\n! +12.5\n! \u221211.5\n! \u221212.5\n|-\n| to nearest, ties to even\n| +12.0\n| +12.0\n| \u221212.0\n| \u221212.0\n|-\n| to nearest, ties away from zero\n| +12.0\n| +13.0\n| \u221212.0\n| \u221213.0\n|-\n| toward 0\n| +11.0\n| +12.0\n| \u221211.0\n| \u221212.0\n|-\n| toward +\u221e\n| +12.0\n| +13.0\n| \u221211.0\n| \u221212.0\n|-\n| toward \u2212\u221e\n| +11.0\n| +12.0\n| \u221212.0\n| \u221213.0\n|}\n\nUnless specified otherwise, the floating-point result of an operation is determined by applying the rounding function on the infinitely precise (mathematical) result. The operation is said to be ''correctly rounded''.  This requirement is called ''correct rounding''.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2019|loc=\u00a72.1}}</ref>\n\n== Required operations ==\n\nRequired operations for a supported arithmetic format (including the basic formats) include:\n\n* Arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide, square root, [[Multiply\u2013accumulate operation|fused multiply\u2013add]], remainder)<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.3.1}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.4.1}}</ref>\n* Conversions (between formats, to and from strings, ''etc.'')<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.4.2}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.4.3}}</ref>\n* Scaling and (for decimal) quantizing<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.3.2}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.3.3}}</ref>\n* Copying and manipulating the sign (abs, negate, ''etc.'')<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.5.1}}</ref>\n* Comparisons and total ordering<ref name=total-ordering>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.10}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.11}}</ref>\n* Classification and testing for NaNs, ''etc.''<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.7.2}}</ref>\n* Testing and setting flags<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.7.4}}</ref>\n* Miscellaneous operations.\n\n=== Comparison predicates ===\n\nThe standard provides comparison predicates to compare one floating-point datum to another in the supported arithmetic format.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2019|loc=\u00a75.11}}</ref> Any comparison with a NaN is treated as unordered. \u22120 and +0 compare as equal.\n\n=== Total-ordering predicate ===\n\nThe standard provides a predicate ''totalOrder'', which defines a [[total order]]ing on canonical members of the supported arithmetic format.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2019|loc=\u00a75.10}}</ref> The predicate agrees with the comparison predicates when one floating-point number is less than the other. The ''totalOrder'' predicate does not impose a total ordering on all encodings in a format. In particular, it does not distinguish among different encodings of the same floating-point representation, as when one or both encodings are non-canonical.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2019|loc=\u00a75.10}}</ref> IEEE 754-2019 incorporates clarifications of ''totalOrder''.\n\n== Exception handling ==\nThe standard defines five exceptions, each of which returns a default value and has a corresponding status flag that (except in certain cases of underflow) is raised when the exception occurs.  No other exception handling is required, but additional non-default alternatives are recommended (see below).\n\nThe five possible exceptions are:\n* Invalid operation: mathematically undefined, ''e.g.'', the square root of a negative number. By default, returns qNaN.\n* Division by zero: an operation on finite operands gives an exact infinite result, ''e.g.'', 1/0 or log(0). By default, returns \u00b1infinity.\n* Overflow: a result is too large to be represented correctly (''i.e.'', its exponent with an unbounded exponent range would be larger than ''emax''). By default, returns \u00b1infinity for the round-to-nearest modes (and follows the rounding rules for the directed rounding modes).\n* Underflow: a result is very small (outside the normal range) and is inexact. By default, returns a [[Denormal number|subnormal]] or zero (following the rounding rules).\n* Inexact: the exact (''i.e.'', unrounded) result is not representable exactly. By default, returns the correctly rounded result.\n\nThese are the same five exceptions as were defined in IEEE 754-1985, but the ''division by zero'' exception has been extended to operations other than the division.\n\nFor decimal floating point, there are additional exceptions along with the above:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://docs.python.org/library/decimal.html#signals|title=9.4. decimal \u2014 Decimal fixed point and floating point arithmetic \u2014 Python 3.6.5 documentation|website=docs.python.org|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://speleotrove.com/decimal/daexcep.html|title=Decimal Arithmetic - Exceptional conditions|website=speleotrove.com|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref>\n* Clamped: a result's exponent is too large for the destination format. By default, trailing zeros will be added to the coefficient to reduce the exponent to the largest usable value. If this is not possible (because this would cause the number of digits needed to be more than the destination format) then overflow occurs.\n* Rounded: a result's coefficient requires more digits than the destination format provides. The inexact is signaled if any non-zero digits are discarded.\n\nAdditionally, operations like quantize when either operand is infinite, or when the result does not fit the destination format, will also signal invalid operation exception.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=&sect;7.2(h)}}</ref>\n\n== Recommendations ==\n\n=== Alternate exception handling ===\nThe standard recommends optional exception handling in various forms, including presubstitution of user-defined default values, and traps (exceptions that change the flow of control in some way) and other exception handling models which interrupt the flow, such as try/catch.  The traps and other exception mechanisms remain optional, as they were in IEEE 754-1985.\n\n=== Recommended operations ===\nClause 9 in the standard recommends additional mathematical operations<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2019|loc=\u00a79.2}}</ref> that language standards should define.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=Clause 9}}.</ref>  These are all optional (not required in order to conform to the standard).\n\nRecommended arithmetic operations, which must round correctly:<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2019|loc=\u00a79.2}}.</ref>\n* [[e\u02e3|<math>e^x</math>]], <math>2^x</math>, <math>10^x</math>\n* [[e\u02e3\u22121|<math>e^x - 1</math>]], <math>2^x - 1</math>, <math>10^x - 1</math>\n* [[Natural logarithm|<math>\\ln x</math>]], [[Binary logarithm|<math>\\log_{2} x</math>]], [[Common logarithm|<math>\\log_{10} x</math>]]\n* [[ln(1+x)|<math>\\ln (1 + x)</math>]], <math>\\log_{2} (1 + x)</math>, <math>\\log_{10} (1 + x)</math>\n* [[Hypot|<math>\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}</math>]]\n* [[Square root|<math>\\sqrt{x}</math>]]\n* <math>(1 + x)^n</math>\n* [[nth root|<math>x^{\\frac{1}{n}}</math>]]\n* [[Exponentiation#Integer exponents|<math>x^n</math>]], [[Exponentiation|<math>x^y</math>]]\n* [[sin (trigonometry)|<math>\\sin x</math>]], [[cos (trigonometry)|<math>\\cos x</math>]], [[tan (trigonometry)|<math>\\tan x</math>]]\n* [[arcsin (trigonometry)|<math>\\arcsin x</math>]], [[arccos (trigonometry)|<math>\\arccos x</math>]], [[arctan (trigonometry)|<math>\\arctan x</math>]], [[atan2|<math>\\operatorname{atan2}(y, x)</math>]]\n* <math>\\operatorname{sinPi} x = \\sin \\pi x</math>, <math>\\operatorname{cosPi} x = \\cos \\pi x</math>, <math>\\operatorname{tanPi} x = \\tan \\pi x</math> (see also: [[Multiples of \u03c0]])\n* <math>\\operatorname{asinPi} x = \\frac{\\arcsin x}{\\pi}</math>, <math>\\operatorname{acosPi} x = \\frac{\\arccos x}{\\pi}</math>, <math>\\operatorname{atanPi} x = \\frac{\\arctan x}{\\pi}</math>, <math>\\operatorname{atan2Pi} (y, x) = \\frac{\\operatorname{atan2}(y, x)}{\\pi}</math> (see also: [[Multiples of \u03c0]])\n* [[sinh (mathematical function)|<math>\\sinh x</math>]], [[cosh (mathematical function)|<math>\\cosh x</math>]], [[tanh (mathematical function)|<math>\\tanh x</math>]]\n* [[arsinh|<math>\\operatorname{arsinh} x</math>]], [[arcosh|<math>\\operatorname{arcosh} x</math>]], [[artanh|<math>\\operatorname{artanh} x</math>]]\n\nThe {{math|asinPi}}, {{math|acosPi}} and {{math|tanPi}} functions were not part of the IEEE 754-2008 standard because the feeling was that they were less necessary.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/754/email/msg03842.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170706053605/http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/754/email/msg03842.html |archive-date=2017-07-06 |title=Re: Missing functions tanPi, asinPi and acosPi |website=grouper.ieee.org |access-date=4 April 2018}}</ref> The first two were at least mentioned in a paragraph, but this was regarded as an error<ref name=IEEE754-errata/> until they were added in the 2019 revision.\n\nThe operations also include setting and accessing dynamic mode rounding direction,<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a79.3}}.</ref> and implementation-defined vector reduction operations such as sum, scaled product, and [[dot product]], whose accuracy is unspecified by the standard.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a79.4}}.</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Augmented arithmetic operation}}\nAs of 2019, ''augmented arithmetic operations''<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2019|loc=\u00a79.5}}.</ref> for the binary formats are also recommended.

By contrast, the previous [[IEEE 754-1985|1985]] version of the standard left aspects of the language interface unspecified, which led to inconsistent behavior between compilers, or different optimization levels in a single compiler.\n\nProgramming languages should allow a user to specify a minimum precision for intermediate calculations of expressions for each radix. This is referred to as \"preferredWidth\" in the standard, and it should be possible to set this on a per block basis. Intermediate calculations within expressions should be calculated, and any temporaries saved, using the maximum of the width of the operands and the preferred width, if set. Thus, for instance, a compiler targeting [[x87]] floating-point hardware should have a means of specifying that intermediate calculations must use the [[Extended precision#IEEE 754 extended precision formats|double-extended format]]. The stored value of a variable must always be used when evaluating subsequent expressions, rather than any precursor from before rounding and assigning to the variable.\n\n=== Reproducibility ===\nThe IEEE 754-1985 allowed many variations in implementations (such as the encoding of some values and the detection of certain exceptions). IEEE 754-2008 has strengthened up many of these, but a few variations still remain (especially for binary formats).  The reproducibility clause recommends that language standards should provide a means to write reproducible programs (i.e., programs that will produce the same result in all implementations of a language) and describes what needs to be done to achieve reproducible results.\n\n== Character representation ==\nThe standard requires operations to convert between basic formats and ''external character sequence'' formats.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.12}}.</ref> Conversions to and from a decimal character format are required for all formats. Conversion to an external character sequence must be such that conversion back using rounding to even will recover the original number. There is no requirement to preserve the payload of a quiet NaN or signaling NaN, and conversion from the external character sequence may turn a signaling NaN into a quiet NaN.\n\nThe original binary value will be preserved by converting to decimal and back again using:<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.12.2}}.</ref>\n* 5 decimal digits for binary16,\n* 9 decimal digits for binary32,\n* 17 decimal digits for binary64,\n* 36 decimal digits for binary128.\n\nFor other binary formats, the required number of decimal digits is\n\n: <math>1 + \\lceil p\\log_{10}(2)\\rceil,</math>\n\nwhere ''p'' is the number of significant bits in the binary format, e.g. 237 bits for binary256.\n\n(Note: as an implementation limit, correct rounding is only guaranteed for the number of decimal digits above plus 3 for the largest supported binary format. For instance, if binary32 is the largest supported binary format, then a conversion from a decimal external sequence with 12 decimal digits is guaranteed to be correctly rounded when converted to binary32; but conversion of a sequence of 13 decimal digits is not; however, the standard recommends that implementations impose no such limit.)\n\nWhen using a decimal floating-point format, the decimal representation will be preserved using:\n* 7 decimal digits for decimal32,\n* 16 decimal digits for decimal64,\n* 34 decimal digits for decimal128.\n\nAlgorithms, with code, for correctly rounded conversion from binary to decimal and decimal to binary are discussed by Gay,<ref>{{Cite journal |first=David M. |last=Gay |title=Correctly rounded binary-decimal and decimal-binary conversions |series=Numerical Analysis Manuscript |id=90-10 |publisher=AT&T Laboratories |location=Murry Hill, NJ, USA |date=November 30, 1990 |url=http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.31.4049 |doi= |ref=harv }}</ref> and for testing{{snd}} by Paxson and Kahan.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=A Program for Testing IEEE Decimal\u2013Binary Conversion |publisher= |series=Manuscript |first1=Vern |last1=Paxson |first2=William |last2=Kahan |author2-link=William Kahan |date=May 22, 1991 |doi= |ref=harv |citeseerx = 10.1.1.144.5889}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Binade]]\n* [[Coprocessor]]\n* [[C99#IEEE.C2.A0754 floating point support|C99]] for code examples demonstrating  access and use of IEEE 754 features.\n* [[Floating-point arithmetic#IEEE 754: floating point in modern computers|Floating-point arithmetic]], for history, design rationale and example usage of IEEE 754 features.\n* [[Fixed-point arithmetic]], for an alternative approach at computation with rational numbers (especially beneficial when the mantissa range is known, fixed, or bound at compile time).\n* [[IBM System z9]], the first CPU to implement IEEE 754-2008 decimal arithmetic (using hardware microcode).\n* [[IBM z10 (microprocessor)|IBM z10]], [[IBM z196]], [[IBM zEC12 (microprocessor)|IBM zEC12]], and [[IBM z13 (microprocessor)|IBM z13]], CPUs that implement IEEE 754-2008  decimal arithmetic fully in hardware.\n* [[ISO/IEC 10967]], language-independent arithmetic (LIA).\n* [[Minifloat]], low-precision binary floating-point formats following IEEE 754 principles.\n* [[POWER6]], [[POWER7]], and [[POWER8]] CPUs that implement IEEE 754-2008 decimal arithmetic fully in hardware.\n* [[strictfp]], a keyword in the [[Java (programming language)|Java programming language]] that restricts arithmetic to IEEE 754 single and double precision to ensure reproducibility across common hardware platforms.\n* [[Rounding#Table-maker's dilemma|The table-maker's dilemma]] for more about the correct rounding of functions.\n* [[Standard Apple Numerics Environment]]\n* [[Tapered floating point]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=\"lower-alpha\"}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Standards ===\n* {{Cite book |title=IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic |journal=IEEE STD 754-2008 |pages=1\u201370 |author=IEEE Computer Society |date=August 29, 2008 |publisher=IEEE |id=IEEE Std 754-2008 |doi=10.1109/IEEESTD.2008.4610935 |ref=CITEREFIEEE_7542008 |isbn=978-0-7381-5753-5 }}\n* {{Cite book |title=IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic |journal=IEEE STD 754-2019 |pages=1\u201384 |author=IEEE Computer Society |date=July 22, 2019 |publisher=IEEE |id=IEEE Std 754-2019 |doi=10.1109/IEEESTD.2019.8766229  |isbn=978-1-5044-5924-2 }}\n* {{Cite book |title=ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559:2011 \u2014 Information technology \u2014 Microprocessor Systems \u2014 Floating-Point arithmetic |url=https://www.iso.org/standard/57469.html |publisher=Iso.org |pages=1\u201358 |date=June 2011}}\n\n=== Secondary references ===\n* [http://speleotrove.com/decimal Decimal floating-point] arithmetic, FAQs, bibliography, and links\n* [http://www.cygnus-software.com/papers/comparingfloats/comparingfloats.htm Comparing binary floats]\n* [http://babbage.cs.qc.cuny.edu/IEEE-754.old/References.xhtml IEEE 754 Reference Material]\n* [http://speleotrove.com/decimal/854mins.html IEEE 854-1987]&nbsp;\u2013 History and minutes\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20171230124220/http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/754/reading.html Supplementary readings for IEEE 754].

The standard [[Floating-point arithmetic#IEEE 754 design rationale|addressed many problems]] found in the diverse floating-point implementations that made them difficult to use reliably and [[Software portability|portably]]. Many hardware [[floating-point unit]]s use the IEEE 754 standard.\n\nThe standard defines:\n* ''arithmetic formats:'' sets of [[Binary code|binary]] and [[decimal]] floating-point data, which consist of finite numbers (including [[signed zero]]s and [[subnormal number]]s), [[infinity|infinities]], and special \"not a number\" values ([[NaN]]s)\n* ''interchange formats:'' encodings (bit strings) that may be used to exchange floating-point data in an efficient and compact form\n* ''rounding rules:'' properties to be satisfied when rounding numbers during arithmetic and conversions\n* ''operations:'' arithmetic and other operations (such as [[trigonometric functions]]) on arithmetic formats\n* ''exception handling:'' indications of exceptional conditions (such as [[division by zero]], overflow, ''etc.'')\n\n[[IEEE 754-2008 revision|IEEE 754-2008]], published in August 2008, includes nearly all of the original [[IEEE 754-1985]] standard, plus the [[IEEE 854-1987|IEEE 854-1987 Standard for Radix-Independent Floating-Point Arithmetic]].  {{anchor|2019}}The current version, IEEE 754-2019, was published in July 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://standards.ieee.org/content/ieee-standards/en/standard/754-2019.html|title=IEEE 754-2019 - IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic|website=standards.ieee.org|accessdate=23 July 2019}}</ref> It is a minor revision of the previous version, incorporating mainly clarifications, defect fixes and new recommended operations.\n\n==Standard development==\nThe first standard for floating-point arithmetic, [[IEEE 754-1985]], was published in 1985.

The binary formats in the original standard are included in this new standard along with three new basic formats, one binary and two decimal.  To conform to the current standard, an implementation must implement at least one of the basic formats as both an arithmetic format and an interchange format.\n\nThe international standard '''ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559:2011''' (with content identical to IEEE 754-2008) has been approved for adoption through [[ISO/IEC JTC1|JTC1]]/SC 25 under the ISO/IEEE PSDO Agreement<ref>{{cite web|url=http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/754/email/msg04167.html|title=FW: ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559 (IEEE Std 754-2008)|website=grouper.ieee.org|accessdate=4 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027190846/http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/754/email/msg04167.html|archive-date=2017-10-27}}</ref> and published.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=57469|title=ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559:2011 - Information technology -- Microprocessor Systems -- Floating-Point arithmetic|website=www.iso.org|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe current version, IEEE 754-2019 published in July 2019, is derived from and replaces IEEE 754-2008, following a revision process started in September 2015, chaired by David G.

A format may also include how the set is encoded.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a72.1.27}}.</ref>\n\nA floating-point format is specified by:\n* a base (also called ''radix'') ''b'', which is either 2 (binary) or 10 (decimal) in IEEE 754;\n* a precision ''p'';\n* an exponent range from ''emin'' to ''emax'', with ''emin'' = 1 \u2212 ''emax'' for all IEEE 754 formats.\n\nA format comprises:\n* Finite numbers, which can be described by three integers: ''s''&nbsp;= a ''sign'' (zero or one), ''c''&nbsp;= a ''[[significand]]'' (or ''coefficient'') having no more than ''p'' digits when written in base ''b'' (i.e., an integer in the range through 0 to ''b''<sup>''p''</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1), and ''q''&nbsp;= an ''exponent'' such that ''emin'' \u2264 ''q''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''p''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 \u2264 ''emax''. The numerical value of such a finite number is {{nowrap|(\u22121)<sup>''s''</sup> \u00d7 ''c'' \u00d7 ''b''<sup>''q''</sup>}}.<ref group=\"lower-alpha\">For example, if the base is 10, the sign is 1 (indicating negative), the significand is 12345, and the exponent is \u22123, then the value of the number is {{nowrap|(\u22121)<sup>1</sup> \u00d7 12345 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22123</sup>}} = {{nowrap|\u22121 \u00d7 12345 \u00d7 0.001}} = \u221212.345.</ref> Moreover, there are two zero values, called [[signed zero]]s: the sign bit specifies whether a zero is +0 (positive zero) or \u22120 (negative zero).\n* Two infinities: +\u221e and \u2212\u221e.\n* Two kinds of [[NaN]] (not-a-number): a quiet NaN (qNaN) and a signaling NaN (sNaN).\n\nFor example, if ''b'' = 10, ''p'' = 7, and ''emax'' = 96, then ''emin'' = \u221295, the significand satisfies 0 \u2264 ''c'' \u2264 {{val|9999999}}, and the exponent satisfies \u2212101 \u2264 ''q'' \u2264 90. Consequently, the smallest non-zero positive number that can be represented is 1\u00d710<sup>\u2212101</sup>, and the largest is 9999999\u00d710<sup>90</sup> (9.999999\u00d710<sup>96</sup>), so the full range of numbers is \u22129.999999\u00d710<sup>96</sup> through 9.999999\u00d710<sup>96</sup>. The numbers \u2212''b''<sup>1\u2212''emax''</sup> and ''b''<sup>1\u2212''emax''</sup> (here, \u22121\u00d710<sup>\u221295</sup> and 1\u00d710<sup>\u221295</sup>) are the smallest (in magnitude) ''normal numbers''; non-zero numbers between these smallest numbers are called [[subnormal number]]s.\n\n=== Representation and encoding in memory ===\nSome numbers may have several possible exponential format representations. For instance, if ''b''\u00a0=\u00a010, and ''p''\u00a0=\u00a07, then \u221212.345 can be represented by \u221212345\u00d710<sup>\u22123</sup>, \u2212123450\u00d710<sup>\u22124</sup>, and \u22121234500\u00d710<sup>\u22125</sup>. However, for most operations, such as arithmetic operations, the result (value) does not depend on the representation of the inputs.\n\nFor the decimal formats, any representation is valid, and the set of these representations is called a ''cohort''. When a result can have several representations, the standard specifies which member of the cohort is chosen.\n\nFor the binary formats, the representation is made unique by choosing the smallest representable exponent allowing the value to be represented exactly. Further, the exponent is not represented directly, but a bias is added so that the smallest representable exponent is represented as 1, with 0 used for subnormal numbers. For numbers with an exponent in the normal range (the exponent field being not all ones or all zeros), the leading bit of the significand will always be 1. Consequently, a leading 1 can be implied rather than explicitly present in the memory encoding, and under the standard the explicitly represented part of the significand will lie between 0 and 1. This rule is called ''leading bit convention'', ''implicit bit convention'', or ''hidden bit convention''. This rule allows the binary format to have an extra bit of precision. The leading bit convention cannot be used for the subnormal numbers as they have an exponent outside the normal exponent range and scale by the smallest represented exponent as used for the smallest normal numbers.\n\nDue to the possibility of multiple encodings (at least in formats called ''interchange formats''), a NaN may carry other information: a sign bit (which has no meaning, but may be used by some operations) and a ''payload'', which is intended for diagnostic information indicating the source of the NaN (but the payload may have other uses, such as ''NaN-boxing''<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/SpiderMonkey/Internals |title=SpiderMonkey Internals |website=developer.mozilla.org |accessdate=11 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last1=Klemens |first1=Ben |title=21st Century C: C Tips from the New School |date=September 2014 |publisher=O'Reilly Media, Incorporated |page=160 |url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=ASuiBAAAQBAJ |accessdate=11 March 2018|isbn=9781491904442 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://github.com/zuiderkwast/nanbox |title=zuiderkwast/nanbox: NaN-boxing in C |website=[[GitHub]] |accessdate=11 March 2018}}</ref>).\n\n=== Basic and interchange formats ===\n\nThe standard defines five basic formats that are named for their numeric base and the number of bits used in their interchange encoding. There are three binary floating-point basic formats (encoded with 32, 64 or 128 bits) and two decimal floating-point basic formats (encoded with 64 or 128 bits). The [[binary32]] and [[binary64]] formats are the ''single'' and ''double'' formats of [[IEEE 754-1985]] respectively. A conforming implementation must fully implement at least one of the basic formats.\n\nThe standard also defines ''[[#Interchange formats|interchange formats]]'', which generalize these basic formats.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a73.6}}.</ref> For the binary formats, the leading bit convention is required. The following table summarizes the smallest interchange formats (including the basic ones).\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! Name                                                   !! Common name        !!

For example, the smallest positive number that can be represented in binary64 is 2<sup>\u22121074</sup>; contributions to the \u22121074 figure include the E&nbsp;min value \u22121022 and all but one of the 53 significand bits (2<sup>\u22121022&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;(53&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1)</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2<sup>\u22121074</sup>).\n\nDecimal digits is ''digits'' \u00d7 log<sub>10</sub> ''base''. This gives an approximate precision in number of decimal digits.\n\nDecimal E max is ''Emax'' \u00d7 log<sub>10</sub> ''base''. This gives an approximate value of the maximum decimal exponent.\n\nThe binary32 (single) and binary64 (double) formats are two of the most common formats used today. The figure below shows the absolute precision for both formats over a range of values. This figure can be used to select an appropriate format given the expected value of a number and the required precision.\n\n[[File:IEEE754.svg|thumb|none|frame|550px|Precision of binary32 and binary64 in the range 10<sup>\u221212</sup> to 10<sup>12</sup>]]\n\n\nAn example of a layout for [[Single-precision floating-point format|32-bit floating point]] is\n[[File:Float example.svg|none]]\n \nand the [[Double-precision floating-point format|64 bit layout is similar]].\n\n=== Extended and extendable precision formats ===\nThe standard specifies optional [[Extended precision|extended]] and extendable precision formats, which provide greater precision than the basic formats.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a73.7}}.</ref> An extended precision format extends a basic format by using more precision and more exponent range. An extendable precision format allows the user to specify the precision and exponent range. An implementation may use whatever internal representation it chooses for such formats; all that needs to be defined are its parameters (''b'', ''p'', and ''emax''). These parameters uniquely describe the set of finite numbers (combinations of sign, significand, and exponent for the given radix) that it can represent.\n\nThe standard recommends that language standards provide a method of specifying ''p'' and ''emax'' for each supported base ''b''.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a73.7}} states: \"Language standards should define mechanisms supporting extendable precision for each supported radix.\"</ref><!-- extendable recommendation does not apply to \"implementations\". --> The standard recommends that language standards and implementations support an extended format which has a greater precision than the largest basic format supported for each radix ''b''.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a73.7}} states: \"Language standards or implementations should support an extended precision format that extends the widest basic format that is supported in that radix.\"</ref> For an extended format with a precision between two basic formats the exponent range must be as great as that of the next wider basic format. So for instance a 64-bit extended precision binary number must have an 'emax' of at least 16383. The [[x87]] [[Extended precision#x86 extended precision format|80-bit extended format]] meets this requirement.\n\n=== Interchange formats ===\nInterchange formats are intended for the exchange of floating-point data using a bit string of fixed length for a given format. \n\n====Binary====\nFor the exchange of binary floating-point numbers, interchange formats of length 16 bits, 32 bits, 64 bits, and any multiple of 32 bits \u2265 128<ref group=\"lower-alpha\">Contrary to decimal, there is no binary interchange format of 96-bit length. Such a format is still allowed as a non-interchange format, though.</ref> are defined.  The 16-bit format is intended for the exchange or storage of small numbers (e.g., for graphics).\n\nThe encoding scheme for these binary interchange formats is the same as that of IEEE 754-1985: a sign bit, followed by ''w'' exponent bits that describe the exponent offset by a ''[[Exponent bias|bias]]'', and ''p''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 bits that describe the significand.  The width of the exponent field for a ''k''-bit format is computed as ''w''&nbsp;=&nbsp;round(4&nbsp;log<sub>2</sub>(''k''))&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;13.  The existing 64- and 128-bit formats follow this rule, but the 16- and 32-bit formats have more exponent bits (5 and 8 respectively) than this formula would provide (3 and 7 respectively).\n\nAs with IEEE 754-1985, the biased-exponent field is filled with all 1 bits to indicate either infinity (trailing significand field = 0) or a NaN (trailing significand field \u2260 0).  For NaNs, quiet NaNs and signaling NaNs are distinguished by using the most significant bit of the trailing significand field exclusively,{{efn|The standard recommends 0 for signaling NaNs, 1 for quiet NaNs, so that a signaling NaNs can be quieted by changing only this bit to 1, while the reverse could yield the encoding of an infinity.}} and the payload is carried in the remaining bits.\n\n====Decimal====\nFor the exchange of decimal floating-point numbers, interchange formats of any multiple of 32 bits are defined. As with binary interchange, the encoding scheme for the decimal interchange formats encodes the sign, exponent, and significand. Two different bit-level encodings are defined, and interchange is complicated by the fact that some external indicator of the encoding in use may be required.\n\nThe two options allow the significand to be encoded as a compressed sequence of decimal digits using [[densely packed decimal]] or, alternatively, as a binary integer.  The former is more convenient for direct hardware implementation of the standard, while the latter is more suited to software emulation on a binary computer.  In either case, the set of numbers (combinations of sign, significand, and exponent) that may be encoded is identical, and [[Floating point#Special values|special values]] (\u00b1zero with the minimum exponent, \u00b1infinity, quiet NaNs, and signaling NaNs) have identical encodings.\n\n== Rounding rules ==\nThe standard defines five rounding rules.  The first two rules round to a nearest value; the others are called ''[[directed rounding]]s'':\n\n=== Roundings to nearest ===\n* '''[[Rounding#Round half to even|Round to nearest, ties to even]]'''&nbsp;\u2013 rounds to the nearest value; if the number falls midway, it is rounded to the nearest value with an even least significant digit; this is the default for binary floating point and the recommended default for decimal.\n* '''[[Rounding#Round half away from zero|Round to nearest, ties away from zero]]'''&nbsp;\u2013 rounds to the nearest value; if the number falls midway, it is rounded to the nearest value above (for positive numbers) or below (for negative numbers); this is intended as an option for decimal floating point.\n\n=== Directed roundings ===\n* '''Round toward 0'''&nbsp;\u2013 directed rounding towards zero (also known as ''truncation'').\n* '''Round toward +\u221e'''&nbsp;\u2013 directed rounding towards positive infinity (also known as ''rounding up'' or ''ceiling'').\n* '''Round toward \u2212\u221e'''&nbsp;\u2013 directed rounding towards negative infinity (also known as ''rounding down'' or ''floor'').\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Example of rounding to integers using the IEEE 754 rules\n!rowspan=2| Mode ||colspan=4| Example value\n|-\n! +11.5\n! +12.5\n! \u221211.5\n! \u221212.5\n|-\n| to nearest, ties to even\n| +12.0\n| +12.0\n| \u221212.0\n| \u221212.0\n|-\n| to nearest, ties away from zero\n| +12.0\n| +13.0\n| \u221212.0\n| \u221213.0\n|-\n| toward 0\n| +11.0\n| +12.0\n| \u221211.0\n| \u221212.0\n|-\n| toward +\u221e\n| +12.0\n| +13.0\n| \u221211.0\n| \u221212.0\n|-\n| toward \u2212\u221e\n| +11.0\n| +12.0\n| \u221212.0\n| \u221213.0\n|}\n\nUnless specified otherwise, the floating-point result of an operation is determined by applying the rounding function on the infinitely precise (mathematical) result. The operation is said to be ''correctly rounded''.  This requirement is called ''correct rounding''.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2019|loc=\u00a72.1}}</ref>\n\n== Required operations ==\n\nRequired operations for a supported arithmetic format (including the basic formats) include:\n\n* Arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide, square root, [[Multiply\u2013accumulate operation|fused multiply\u2013add]], remainder)<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.3.1}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.4.1}}</ref>\n* Conversions (between formats, to and from strings, ''etc.'')<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.4.2}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.4.3}}</ref>\n* Scaling and (for decimal) quantizing<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.3.2}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.3.3}}</ref>\n* Copying and manipulating the sign (abs, negate, ''etc.'')<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.5.1}}</ref>\n* Comparisons and total ordering<ref name=total-ordering>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.10}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.11}}</ref>\n* Classification and testing for NaNs, ''etc.''<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.7.2}}</ref>\n* Testing and setting flags<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.7.4}}</ref>\n* Miscellaneous operations.\n\n=== Comparison predicates ===\n\nThe standard provides comparison predicates to compare one floating-point datum to another in the supported arithmetic format.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2019|loc=\u00a75.11}}</ref> Any comparison with a NaN is treated as unordered. \u22120 and +0 compare as equal.\n\n=== Total-ordering predicate ===\n\nThe standard provides a predicate ''totalOrder'', which defines a [[total order]]ing on canonical members of the supported arithmetic format.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2019|loc=\u00a75.10}}</ref> The predicate agrees with the comparison predicates when one floating-point number is less than the other. The ''totalOrder'' predicate does not impose a total ordering on all encodings in a format. In particular, it does not distinguish among different encodings of the same floating-point representation, as when one or both encodings are non-canonical.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2019|loc=\u00a75.10}}</ref> IEEE 754-2019 incorporates clarifications of ''totalOrder''.\n\n== Exception handling ==\nThe standard defines five exceptions, each of which returns a default value and has a corresponding status flag that (except in certain cases of underflow) is raised when the exception occurs.  No other exception handling is required, but additional non-default alternatives are recommended (see below).\n\nThe five possible exceptions are:\n* Invalid operation: mathematically undefined, ''e.g.'', the square root of a negative number. By default, returns qNaN.\n* Division by zero: an operation on finite operands gives an exact infinite result, ''e.g.'', 1/0 or log(0). By default, returns \u00b1infinity.\n* Overflow: a result is too large to be represented correctly (''i.e.'', its exponent with an unbounded exponent range would be larger than ''emax''). By default, returns \u00b1infinity for the round-to-nearest modes (and follows the rounding rules for the directed rounding modes).\n* Underflow: a result is very small (outside the normal range) and is inexact. By default, returns a [[Denormal number|subnormal]] or zero (following the rounding rules).\n* Inexact: the exact (''i.e.'', unrounded) result is not representable exactly. By default, returns the correctly rounded result.\n\nThese are the same five exceptions as were defined in IEEE 754-1985, but the ''division by zero'' exception has been extended to operations other than the division.\n\nFor decimal floating point, there are additional exceptions along with the above:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://docs.python.org/library/decimal.html#signals|title=9.4. decimal \u2014 Decimal fixed point and floating point arithmetic \u2014 Python 3.6.5 documentation|website=docs.python.org|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://speleotrove.com/decimal/daexcep.html|title=Decimal Arithmetic - Exceptional conditions|website=speleotrove.com|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref>\n* Clamped: a result's exponent is too large for the destination format. By default, trailing zeros will be added to the coefficient to reduce the exponent to the largest usable value. If this is not possible (because this would cause the number of digits needed to be more than the destination format) then overflow occurs.\n* Rounded: a result's coefficient requires more digits than the destination format provides. The inexact is signaled if any non-zero digits are discarded.\n\nAdditionally, operations like quantize when either operand is infinite, or when the result does not fit the destination format, will also signal invalid operation exception.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=&sect;7.2(h)}}</ref>\n\n== Recommendations ==\n\n=== Alternate exception handling ===\nThe standard recommends optional exception handling in various forms, including presubstitution of user-defined default values, and traps (exceptions that change the flow of control in some way) and other exception handling models which interrupt the flow, such as try/catch.  The traps and other exception mechanisms remain optional, as they were in IEEE 754-1985.\n\n=== Recommended operations ===\nClause 9 in the standard recommends additional mathematical operations<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2019|loc=\u00a79.2}}</ref> that language standards should define.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=Clause 9}}.</ref>  These are all optional (not required in order to conform to the standard).\n\nRecommended arithmetic operations, which must round correctly:<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2019|loc=\u00a79.2}}.</ref>\n* [[e\u02e3|<math>e^x</math>]], <math>2^x</math>, <math>10^x</math>\n* [[e\u02e3\u22121|<math>e^x - 1</math>]], <math>2^x - 1</math>, <math>10^x - 1</math>\n* [[Natural logarithm|<math>\\ln x</math>]], [[Binary logarithm|<math>\\log_{2} x</math>]], [[Common logarithm|<math>\\log_{10} x</math>]]\n* [[ln(1+x)|<math>\\ln (1 + x)</math>]], <math>\\log_{2} (1 + x)</math>, <math>\\log_{10} (1 + x)</math>\n* [[Hypot|<math>\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}</math>]]\n* [[Square root|<math>\\sqrt{x}</math>]]\n* <math>(1 + x)^n</math>\n* [[nth root|<math>x^{\\frac{1}{n}}</math>]]\n* [[Exponentiation#Integer exponents|<math>x^n</math>]], [[Exponentiation|<math>x^y</math>]]\n* [[sin (trigonometry)|<math>\\sin x</math>]], [[cos (trigonometry)|<math>\\cos x</math>]], [[tan (trigonometry)|<math>\\tan x</math>]]\n* [[arcsin (trigonometry)|<math>\\arcsin x</math>]], [[arccos (trigonometry)|<math>\\arccos x</math>]], [[arctan (trigonometry)|<math>\\arctan x</math>]], [[atan2|<math>\\operatorname{atan2}(y, x)</math>]]\n* <math>\\operatorname{sinPi} x = \\sin \\pi x</math>, <math>\\operatorname{cosPi} x = \\cos \\pi x</math>, <math>\\operatorname{tanPi} x = \\tan \\pi x</math> (see also: [[Multiples of \u03c0]])\n* <math>\\operatorname{asinPi} x = \\frac{\\arcsin x}{\\pi}</math>, <math>\\operatorname{acosPi} x = \\frac{\\arccos x}{\\pi}</math>, <math>\\operatorname{atanPi} x = \\frac{\\arctan x}{\\pi}</math>, <math>\\operatorname{atan2Pi} (y, x) = \\frac{\\operatorname{atan2}(y, x)}{\\pi}</math> (see also: [[Multiples of \u03c0]])\n* [[sinh (mathematical function)|<math>\\sinh x</math>]], [[cosh (mathematical function)|<math>\\cosh x</math>]], [[tanh (mathematical function)|<math>\\tanh x</math>]]\n* [[arsinh|<math>\\operatorname{arsinh} x</math>]], [[arcosh|<math>\\operatorname{arcosh} x</math>]], [[artanh|<math>\\operatorname{artanh} x</math>]]\n\nThe {{math|asinPi}}, {{math|acosPi}} and {{math|tanPi}} functions were not part of the IEEE 754-2008 standard because the feeling was that they were less necessary.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/754/email/msg03842.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170706053605/http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/754/email/msg03842.html |archive-date=2017-07-06 |title=Re: Missing functions tanPi, asinPi and acosPi |website=grouper.ieee.org |access-date=4 April 2018}}</ref> The first two were at least mentioned in a paragraph, but this was regarded as an error<ref name=IEEE754-errata/> until they were added in the 2019 revision.\n\nThe operations also include setting and accessing dynamic mode rounding direction,<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a79.3}}.</ref> and implementation-defined vector reduction operations such as sum, scaled product, and [[dot product]], whose accuracy is unspecified by the standard.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a79.4}}.</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Augmented arithmetic operation}}\nAs of 2019, ''augmented arithmetic operations''<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2019|loc=\u00a79.5}}.</ref> for the binary formats are also recommended.

By contrast, the previous [[IEEE 754-1985|1985]] version of the standard left aspects of the language interface unspecified, which led to inconsistent behavior between compilers, or different optimization levels in a single compiler.\n\nProgramming languages should allow a user to specify a minimum precision for intermediate calculations of expressions for each radix. This is referred to as \"preferredWidth\" in the standard, and it should be possible to set this on a per block basis. Intermediate calculations within expressions should be calculated, and any temporaries saved, using the maximum of the width of the operands and the preferred width, if set. Thus, for instance, a compiler targeting [[x87]] floating-point hardware should have a means of specifying that intermediate calculations must use the [[Extended precision#IEEE 754 extended precision formats|double-extended format]]. The stored value of a variable must always be used when evaluating subsequent expressions, rather than any precursor from before rounding and assigning to the variable.\n\n=== Reproducibility ===\nThe IEEE 754-1985 allowed many variations in implementations (such as the encoding of some values and the detection of certain exceptions). IEEE 754-2008 has strengthened up many of these, but a few variations still remain (especially for binary formats).  The reproducibility clause recommends that language standards should provide a means to write reproducible programs (i.e., programs that will produce the same result in all implementations of a language) and describes what needs to be done to achieve reproducible results.\n\n== Character representation ==\nThe standard requires operations to convert between basic formats and ''external character sequence'' formats.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.12}}.</ref> Conversions to and from a decimal character format are required for all formats. Conversion to an external character sequence must be such that conversion back using rounding to even will recover the original number. There is no requirement to preserve the payload of a quiet NaN or signaling NaN, and conversion from the external character sequence may turn a signaling NaN into a quiet NaN.\n\nThe original binary value will be preserved by converting to decimal and back again using:<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.12.2}}.</ref>\n* 5 decimal digits for binary16,\n* 9 decimal digits for binary32,\n* 17 decimal digits for binary64,\n* 36 decimal digits for binary128.\n\nFor other binary formats, the required number of decimal digits is\n\n: <math>1 + \\lceil p\\log_{10}(2)\\rceil,</math>\n\nwhere ''p'' is the number of significant bits in the binary format, e.g. 237 bits for binary256.\n\n(Note: as an implementation limit, correct rounding is only guaranteed for the number of decimal digits above plus 3 for the largest supported binary format. For instance, if binary32 is the largest supported binary format, then a conversion from a decimal external sequence with 12 decimal digits is guaranteed to be correctly rounded when converted to binary32; but conversion of a sequence of 13 decimal digits is not; however, the standard recommends that implementations impose no such limit.)\n\nWhen using a decimal floating-point format, the decimal representation will be preserved using:\n* 7 decimal digits for decimal32,\n* 16 decimal digits for decimal64,\n* 34 decimal digits for decimal128.\n\nAlgorithms, with code, for correctly rounded conversion from binary to decimal and decimal to binary are discussed by Gay,<ref>{{Cite journal |first=David M. |last=Gay |title=Correctly rounded binary-decimal and decimal-binary conversions |series=Numerical Analysis Manuscript |id=90-10 |publisher=AT&T Laboratories |location=Murry Hill, NJ, USA |date=November 30, 1990 |url=http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.31.4049 |doi= |ref=harv }}</ref> and for testing{{snd}} by Paxson and Kahan.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=A Program for Testing IEEE Decimal\u2013Binary Conversion |publisher= |series=Manuscript |first1=Vern |last1=Paxson |first2=William |last2=Kahan |author2-link=William Kahan |date=May 22, 1991 |doi= |ref=harv |citeseerx = 10.1.1.144.5889}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Binade]]\n* [[Coprocessor]]\n* [[C99#IEEE.C2.A0754 floating point support|C99]] for code examples demonstrating  access and use of IEEE 754 features.\n* [[Floating-point arithmetic#IEEE 754: floating point in modern computers|Floating-point arithmetic]], for history, design rationale and example usage of IEEE 754 features.\n* [[Fixed-point arithmetic]], for an alternative approach at computation with rational numbers (especially beneficial when the mantissa range is known, fixed, or bound at compile time).\n* [[IBM System z9]], the first CPU to implement IEEE 754-2008 decimal arithmetic (using hardware microcode).\n* [[IBM z10 (microprocessor)|IBM z10]], [[IBM z196]], [[IBM zEC12 (microprocessor)|IBM zEC12]], and [[IBM z13 (microprocessor)|IBM z13]], CPUs that implement IEEE 754-2008  decimal arithmetic fully in hardware.\n* [[ISO/IEC 10967]], language-independent arithmetic (LIA).\n* [[Minifloat]], low-precision binary floating-point formats following IEEE 754 principles.\n* [[POWER6]], [[POWER7]], and [[POWER8]] CPUs that implement IEEE 754-2008 decimal arithmetic fully in hardware.\n* [[strictfp]], a keyword in the [[Java (programming language)|Java programming language]] that restricts arithmetic to IEEE 754 single and double precision to ensure reproducibility across common hardware platforms.\n* [[Rounding#Table-maker's dilemma|The table-maker's dilemma]] for more about the correct rounding of functions.\n* [[Standard Apple Numerics Environment]]\n* [[Tapered floating point]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=\"lower-alpha\"}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Standards ===\n* {{Cite book |title=IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic |journal=IEEE STD 754-2008 |pages=1\u201370 |author=IEEE Computer Society |date=August 29, 2008 |publisher=IEEE |id=IEEE Std 754-2008 |doi=10.1109/IEEESTD.2008.4610935 |ref=CITEREFIEEE_7542008 |isbn=978-0-7381-5753-5 }}\n* {{Cite book |title=IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic |journal=IEEE STD 754-2019 |pages=1\u201384 |author=IEEE Computer Society |date=July 22, 2019 |publisher=IEEE |id=IEEE Std 754-2019 |doi=10.1109/IEEESTD.2019.8766229  |isbn=978-1-5044-5924-2 }}\n* {{Cite book |title=ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559:2011 \u2014 Information technology \u2014 Microprocessor Systems \u2014 Floating-Point arithmetic |url=https://www.iso.org/standard/57469.html |publisher=Iso.org |pages=1\u201358 |date=June 2011}}\n\n=== Secondary references ===\n* [http://speleotrove.com/decimal Decimal floating-point] arithmetic, FAQs, bibliography, and links\n* [http://www.cygnus-software.com/papers/comparingfloats/comparingfloats.htm Comparing binary floats]\n* [http://babbage.cs.qc.cuny.edu/IEEE-754.old/References.xhtml IEEE 754 Reference Material]\n* [http://speleotrove.com/decimal/854mins.html IEEE 854-1987]&nbsp;\u2013 History and minutes\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20171230124220/http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/754/reading.html Supplementary readings for IEEE 754].
