The former was [[Subduction|subducted]] beneath the latter, deeper into the earth. As the water-saturated sediments of the oceanic African plate were pushed to hotter depths inside the planet, the water boiled off and lowered the melting point of the [[upper mantle (Earth)|upper mantle]] enough to partially melt the rocks. Because magma is less dense than the solid rock around it, it was pushed upward. Finding a weak spot at the Earth's surface, it broke through, thus forming the volcano.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe volcano is one of several which form the [[Campanian volcanic arc]]. Others include [[Campi Flegrei]], a large [[caldera]] a few kilometers to the north west, [[Mount Epomeo]], {{convert|20|km}} to the west on the island of [[Ischia]], and several undersea volcanoes to the south. The arc forms the southern end of a larger chain of volcanoes produced by the [[subduction]] process described above, which extends northwest along the length of Italy as far as [[Monte Amiata]] in Southern [[Tuscany]]. Vesuvius is the only one to have erupted within recent history, although some of the others have erupted within the last few hundred years. Many are either extinct or have not erupted for tens of thousands of years.\n\n==Eruptions==\n{{Decade Volcanoes Map}}\n[[File:Procession des reliques de Saint Janvier en 1822.jpg|thumb|Procession of [[Januarius|Saint Januarius]] during an eruption of Vesuvius in 1822]]\nMount Vesuvius has erupted many times. The eruption in AD 79 was preceded by numerous others in prehistory, including at least three significantly larger ones, including the [[Avellino eruption]] around 1800 BC which engulfed several Bronze Age settlements. Since AD 79, the volcano has also erupted repeatedly, in 172, 203, 222, possibly in 303, 379, 472, 512, 536, 685, 787, around 860, around 900, 968, 991, 999, 1006, 1037, 1049, around 1073, 1139, 1150, and there may have been eruptions in 1270, 1347, and 1500.<ref name = \"global volcanism\"/>\nThe volcano erupted again in 1631, six times in the 18th century (including 1779 and 1794), eight times in the 19th century (notably in 1872), and in 1906, 1929 and 1944. There have been no eruptions since 1944, and none of the eruptions after AD 79 were as large or destructive as the Pompeian one.\n\nThe eruptions vary greatly in severity but are characterized by explosive outbursts of the kind dubbed [[Plinian Eruption|Plinian]] after [[Pliny the Younger]], a Roman writer who published a detailed description of the 79 AD eruption, including his uncle's death.<ref>Pliny the Younger, ''Letters'' [http://www.bartleby.com/9/4/1065.html 6.16].</ref> On occasion, eruptions from Vesuvius have been so large that the whole of southern Europe has been blanketed by ash; in 472 and 1631, Vesuvian ash fell on [[Constantinople]] ([[Istanbul]]), over {{convert|1200|km}} away.

The black cloud represents the general distribution of ash, pumice and cinders. Modern coast lines are shown.]]\nReconstructions of the eruption and its effects vary considerably in the details but have the same overall features. The eruption lasted two days. The morning of the first day was perceived as normal by the only eyewitness to leave a surviving document, Pliny the Younger. In the middle of the day an explosion threw up a high-altitude column from which ash and pumice began to fall, blanketing the area. Rescues and escapes occurred during this time. At some time in the night or early the next day [[pyroclastic surge]]s in the close vicinity of the volcano began. Lights were seen on the peak interpreted as fires. People as far away as Misenum fled for their lives. The flows were rapid-moving, dense and very hot, knocking down wholly or partly all structures in their path, incinerating or suffocating all population remaining there and altering the landscape, including the coastline. These were accompanied by additional light tremors and a mild [[tsunami]] in the Bay of Naples. By late afternoon of the second day, the eruption was over, leaving only haze in the atmosphere through which the sun shone weakly.\n\nThe latest scientific studies of the ash produced by Vesuvius reveals a multi-phase eruption.<ref>{{harvnb|Sigurdsson|2002}}</ref> The initial major explosion produced a column of ash and pumice ranging between {{convert|15|and|30|km|ft}} high, which rained on Pompeii to the southeast but not on Herculaneum upwind. The chief energy supporting the column came from the escape of steam superheated by the magma, created from seawater seeping over time into the deep faults of the region, that came into interaction with magma and heat.\n\nSubsequently, the cloud collapsed as the gases expanded and lost their capability to support their solid contents, releasing it as a pyroclastic surge, which first reached Herculaneum but not Pompeii. Additional blasts reinstituted the column. The eruption alternated between Plinian and Pel\u00e9an six times. Surges 3 and 4 are believed by the authors to have buried Pompeii.<ref>{{harvnb|Sigurdsson|2002|pp=42\u201343}}</ref> Surges are identified in the deposits by dune and cross-bedding formations, which are not produced by fallout.\n\nAnother study used the magnetic characteristics of over 200 samples of roof-tile and plaster fragments collected around Pompeii to estimate equilibrium temperature of the pyroclastic flow.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=5}}</ref> The magnetic study revealed that on the first day of the eruption a fall of white pumice containing clastic fragments of up to {{convert|3|cm|in}} fell for several hours.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=3}}</ref> It heated the roof tiles up to {{convert|140|C}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=12}}</ref> This period would have been the last opportunity to escape.\n\nThe collapse of the Plinian columns on the second day caused pyroclastic density currents (PDCs) that devastated Herculaneum and Pompeii.

This cloud and a request by a messenger for an evacuation by sea prompted the elder Pliny to order rescue operations in which he sailed away to participate. His nephew attempted to resume a normal life, but that night a tremor awoke him and his mother, prompting them to abandon the house for the courtyard. Further tremors near dawn caused the population to abandon the village and caused disastrous [[tsunami|wave action]] in the [[Bay of Naples]].\n\nThe early light was obscured by a black cloud through which shone flashes, which Pliny likens to [[Lightning#Sheet lightning|sheet lightning]], but more extensive. The cloud obscured Point Misenum near at hand and the island of Capraia ([[Capri]]) across the bay. Fearing for their lives, the population began to call to each other and move back from the coast along the road. A rain of ash fell, causing Pliny to shake it off periodically to avoid being buried. Later that same day the pumice and ash stopped falling and the sun shone weakly through the cloud, encouraging Pliny and his mother to return to their home and wait for news of Pliny the Elder.\n\nPliny's uncle Pliny the Elder was in command of the [[Roman Navy|Roman fleet]] at Misenum, and had meanwhile decided to investigate the phenomenon at close hand in a light vessel. As the ship was preparing to leave the area, a messenger came from his friend Rectina (wife of Tascius<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faculty.cua.edu/pennington/pompeii/PlinyLetters.htm|title=Pliny Letter 6.16|access-date=May 11, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150511070405/http://faculty.cua.edu/pennington/pompeii/PlinyLetters.htm|archive-date=May 11, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>) living on the coast near the foot of the volcano explaining that her party could only get away by sea and asking for rescue. Pliny ordered the immediate launching of the fleet galleys to the evacuation of the coast. He continued in his light ship to the rescue of Rectina's party.\n\nHe set off across the bay but in the shallows on the other side encountered thick showers of hot cinders, lumps of pumice and pieces of rock. Advised by the helmsman to turn back, he stated \"Fortune favors the brave\" and ordered him to continue on to [[Stabiae]] (about 4.5 kilometers from Pompeii).\n\nPliny the Elder and his party saw flames coming from several parts of the crater. After staying overnight, the party was driven from the building by an accumulation of material, presumably tephra, which threatened to block all egress. They woke Pliny, who had been napping and emitting loud snoring. They elected to take to the fields with pillows tied to their heads to protect them from the raining debris. They approached the beach again but the wind prevented the ships from leaving. Pliny sat down on a sail that had been spread for him and could not rise even with assistance when his friends departed. Though Pliny the Elder died, his friends ultimately escaped by land.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://volcanology.geol.ucsb.edu/pliny.htm |authors=Richard V.

However, Stabiae was 16&nbsp;km from the vent (roughly where the modern town of [[Castellammare di Stabia]] is situated) and his companions were apparently unaffected by the volcanic gases, and so it is more likely that the corpulent Pliny died from some other cause, such as a stroke or heart attack.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/history/lecture19/lec19.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120718082232/http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/history/lecture19/lec19.html |archivedate=July 18, 2012 |title=Lecture 19: Greek, Carthaginian and Roman Agricultural Writers |work=History of Horticulture |year=2002 |first=Jules |last=Janick |publisher=Purdue University |accessdate=May 15, 2010 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> His body was found with no apparent injuries on the next day, after dispersal of the plume.\n{{further|Pliny the Elder}}\n\n====Casualties====\n[[File:Pompeii&Vesuvius.JPG|thumb|Pompeii, with Vesuvius towering above]]\n\nAlong with Pliny the Elder, the only other noble casualties of the eruption to be known by name were Agrippa (a son of the Herodian Jewish princess [[Drusilla (daughter of Agrippa I)|Drusilla]] and the procurator [[Antonius Felix]]) and his wife.<ref>{{cite book|first=Flavius|last=Josephus|authorlink=Josephus|title=Jewish Antiquities |section= xx.7.2|year=94<!-- 94 AD is the real date -->    |title-link=Jewish Antiquities}} Also known to have been mentioned in a section now lost.</ref>\n\nBy 2003, around 1,044&nbsp;casts made from impressions of bodies in the ash deposits had been recovered in and around Pompeii, with the scattered bones of another 100.<ref name=\"Episodes\">{{cite journal |journal= Episodes |volume= 26 |date= September 2003 |url= http://vulcan.fis.uniroma3.it/lavori/episodes.pdf |title= The eruption of Vesuvius of 79 AD and its impact on human environment in Pompei |first1= Lisetta |last1= Giacomelli |first2= Annamaria |last2= Perrotta |first3= Roberto |last3= Scandone |first4= Claudio |last4= Scarpati |issue= 3 |pages= 235\u2013238 |accessdate= May 12, 2010 |ref= harv |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110117200703/http://vulcan.fis.uniroma3.it/lavori/episodes.pdf |archive-date= January 17, 2011 |url-status=dead |df= mdy-all |doi= 10.18814/epiiugs/2003/v26i3/014 }}</ref> The remains of about 332 bodies have been found at Herculaneum (300 in arched vaults discovered in 1980).<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fieldmuseum.org/pompeii/herculaneum_2.asp | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090318012551/http://www.fieldmuseum.org/pompeii/herculaneum_2.asp | archivedate = March 18, 2009 | title = Pompeii, Stories from an eruption: Herculaneum | year=2007|publisher = The Field Museum of Natural History |location=Chicago | work = Soprintendenza archeologica di Pompei| accessdate = May 12, 2010}}</ref> What percentage these numbers are of the total dead or the percentage of the dead to the total number at risk remain completely unknown.\n\nThirty-eight percent of the 1,044 were found in the ash fall deposits, the majority inside buildings. These are thought to have been killed mainly by roof collapses, with the smaller number of victims found outside of buildings probably being killed by falling roof slates or by larger rocks thrown out by the volcano. The remaining 62% of remains found at Pompeii were in the pyroclastic surge deposits,<ref name=\"Episodes\" /> and thus were probably killed by them \u2013 probably from a combination of suffocation through ash inhalation and blast and debris thrown around. In contrast to the victims found at Herculaneum, examination of cloth, frescoes and skeletons show that it is unlikely that high temperatures were a significant cause. Herculaneum, which was much closer to the crater, was saved from tephra falls by the wind direction, but was buried under {{convert |23|m}} of material deposited by pyroclastic surges. It is likely that most, or all, of the known victims in this town were killed by the surges.\n\nPeople caught on the former seashore by the first surge died of thermal shock. The rest were concentrated in arched chambers at a density of as high as 3 persons per square metre. As only {{convert|85|m|ft}} of the coast have been excavated, casualties may be waiting to be excavated.\n\n===Later eruptions from the 3rd to the 19th centuries===\n[[File:Dankaerts-Historis-9322.tif|thumb|Eruption of 16 December 1631.

Torrents of [[lahar]] were also created, adding to the devastation.

Sub-Plinian eruptions producing about {{convert|0.1|km3}}, such as those of 472 and 1631, have been more frequent with a few hundred years between them. From the 1631 eruption until 1944, there was a comparatively small eruption every few years, emitting 0.001\u20130.01&nbsp;km\u00b3 of magma.

The effect is to increase the concentration of dissolved gases (mostly [[sulfur dioxide]] and [[carbon dioxide]]) in the remaining liquid magma, making the subsequent eruption more violent. As gas-rich magma approaches the surface during an [[eruption]], the huge drop in [[internal pressure]] caused by the reduction in weight of the overlying rock (which drops to zero at the surface) causes the gases to come out of solution, the volume of gas increasing explosively from nothing to perhaps many times that of the accompanying magma. Additionally, the removal of the higher melting point material will raise the concentration of [[felsic]] components such as [[silicate]]s potentially making the magma more [[viscous]], adding to the explosive nature of the eruption.\n\n[[File:Naplesbay01.jpg|thumb|left|The area around the volcano is now densely populated.]]\nThe government emergency plan for an eruption therefore assumes that the worst case will be an eruption of similar size and type to the 1631 [[Volcanic Explosivity Index|VEI]] 4<ref>{{cite web | url= http://vulcan.fis.uniroma3.it/vesuvio/VESUVIO_1631-1944.html | title= Activity of Vesuvio between 1631 and 1799 | work= Esplora i Vulcani Italiani | date= 1996\u20132009 | author= Giacomelli, L. | author2= Scandone, R. | publisher= Dipartimento di Fisica E.

The former was [[Subduction|subducted]] beneath the latter, deeper into the earth. As the water-saturated sediments of the oceanic African plate were pushed to hotter depths inside the planet, the water boiled off and lowered the melting point of the [[upper mantle (Earth)|upper mantle]] enough to partially melt the rocks. Because magma is less dense than the solid rock around it, it was pushed upward. Finding a weak spot at the Earth's surface, it broke through, thus forming the volcano.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe volcano is one of several which form the [[Campanian volcanic arc]]. Others include [[Campi Flegrei]], a large [[caldera]] a few kilometers to the north west, [[Mount Epomeo]], {{convert|20|km}} to the west on the island of [[Ischia]], and several undersea volcanoes to the south. The arc forms the southern end of a larger chain of volcanoes produced by the [[subduction]] process described above, which extends northwest along the length of Italy as far as [[Monte Amiata]] in Southern [[Tuscany]]. Vesuvius is the only one to have erupted within recent history, although some of the others have erupted within the last few hundred years. Many are either extinct or have not erupted for tens of thousands of years.\n\n==Eruptions==\n{{Decade Volcanoes Map}}\n[[File:Procession des reliques de Saint Janvier en 1822.jpg|thumb|Procession of [[Januarius|Saint Januarius]] during an eruption of Vesuvius in 1822]]\nMount Vesuvius has erupted many times.

There have been no eruptions since 1944, and none of the eruptions after AD 79 were as large or destructive as the Pompeian one.\n\nThe eruptions vary greatly in severity but are characterized by explosive outbursts of the kind dubbed [[Plinian Eruption|Plinian]] after [[Pliny the Younger]], a Roman writer who published a detailed description of the 79 AD eruption, including his uncle's death.<ref>Pliny the Younger, ''Letters'' [http://www.bartleby.com/9/4/1065.html 6.16].</ref> On occasion, eruptions from Vesuvius have been so large that the whole of southern Europe has been blanketed by ash; in 472 and 1631, Vesuvian ash fell on [[Constantinople]] ([[Istanbul]]), over {{convert|1200|km}} away.

The black cloud represents the general distribution of ash, pumice and cinders. Modern coast lines are shown.]]\nReconstructions of the eruption and its effects vary considerably in the details but have the same overall features. The eruption lasted two days. The morning of the first day was perceived as normal by the only eyewitness to leave a surviving document, Pliny the Younger. In the middle of the day an explosion threw up a high-altitude column from which ash and pumice began to fall, blanketing the area. Rescues and escapes occurred during this time. At some time in the night or early the next day [[pyroclastic surge]]s in the close vicinity of the volcano began. Lights were seen on the peak interpreted as fires. People as far away as Misenum fled for their lives. The flows were rapid-moving, dense and very hot, knocking down wholly or partly all structures in their path, incinerating or suffocating all population remaining there and altering the landscape, including the coastline. These were accompanied by additional light tremors and a mild [[tsunami]] in the Bay of Naples. By late afternoon of the second day, the eruption was over, leaving only haze in the atmosphere through which the sun shone weakly.\n\nThe latest scientific studies of the ash produced by Vesuvius reveals a multi-phase eruption.<ref>{{harvnb|Sigurdsson|2002}}</ref> The initial major explosion produced a column of ash and pumice ranging between {{convert|15|and|30|km|ft}} high, which rained on Pompeii to the southeast but not on Herculaneum upwind. The chief energy supporting the column came from the escape of steam superheated by the magma, created from seawater seeping over time into the deep faults of the region, that came into interaction with magma and heat.\n\nSubsequently, the cloud collapsed as the gases expanded and lost their capability to support their solid contents, releasing it as a pyroclastic surge, which first reached Herculaneum but not Pompeii. Additional blasts reinstituted the column. The eruption alternated between Plinian and Pel\u00e9an six times.

This cloud and a request by a messenger for an evacuation by sea prompted the elder Pliny to order rescue operations in which he sailed away to participate. His nephew attempted to resume a normal life, but that night a tremor awoke him and his mother, prompting them to abandon the house for the courtyard. Further tremors near dawn caused the population to abandon the village and caused disastrous [[tsunami|wave action]] in the [[Bay of Naples]].\n\nThe early light was obscured by a black cloud through which shone flashes, which Pliny likens to [[Lightning#Sheet lightning|sheet lightning]], but more extensive. The cloud obscured Point Misenum near at hand and the island of Capraia ([[Capri]]) across the bay. Fearing for their lives, the population began to call to each other and move back from the coast along the road. A rain of ash fell, causing Pliny to shake it off periodically to avoid being buried. Later that same day the pumice and ash stopped falling and the sun shone weakly through the cloud, encouraging Pliny and his mother to return to their home and wait for news of Pliny the Elder.\n\nPliny's uncle Pliny the Elder was in command of the [[Roman Navy|Roman fleet]] at Misenum, and had meanwhile decided to investigate the phenomenon at close hand in a light vessel. As the ship was preparing to leave the area, a messenger came from his friend Rectina (wife of Tascius<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faculty.cua.edu/pennington/pompeii/PlinyLetters.htm|title=Pliny Letter 6.16|access-date=May 11, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150511070405/http://faculty.cua.edu/pennington/pompeii/PlinyLetters.htm|archive-date=May 11, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>) living on the coast near the foot of the volcano explaining that her party could only get away by sea and asking for rescue. Pliny ordered the immediate launching of the fleet galleys to the evacuation of the coast. He continued in his light ship to the rescue of Rectina's party.\n\nHe set off across the bay but in the shallows on the other side encountered thick showers of hot cinders, lumps of pumice and pieces of rock. Advised by the helmsman to turn back, he stated \"Fortune favors the brave\" and ordered him to continue on to [[Stabiae]] (about 4.5 kilometers from Pompeii).\n\nPliny the Elder and his party saw flames coming from several parts of the crater. After staying overnight, the party was driven from the building by an accumulation of material, presumably tephra, which threatened to block all egress. They woke Pliny, who had been napping and emitting loud snoring. They elected to take to the fields with pillows tied to their heads to protect them from the raining debris. They approached the beach again but the wind prevented the ships from leaving. Pliny sat down on a sail that had been spread for him and could not rise even with assistance when his friends departed.

Herculaneum, which was much closer to the crater, was saved from tephra falls by the wind direction, but was buried under {{convert |23|m}} of material deposited by pyroclastic surges.

As gas-rich magma approaches the surface during an [[eruption]], the huge drop in [[internal pressure]] caused by the reduction in weight of the overlying rock (which drops to zero at the surface) causes the gases to come out of solution, the volume of gas increasing explosively from nothing to perhaps many times that of the accompanying magma. Additionally, the removal of the higher melting point material will raise the concentration of [[felsic]] components such as [[silicate]]s potentially making the magma more [[viscous]], adding to the explosive nature of the eruption.\n\n[[File:Naplesbay01.jpg|thumb|left|The area around the volcano is now densely populated.]]\nThe government emergency plan for an eruption therefore assumes that the worst case will be an eruption of similar size and type to the 1631 [[Volcanic Explosivity Index|VEI]] 4<ref>{{cite web | url= http://vulcan.fis.uniroma3.it/vesuvio/VESUVIO_1631-1944.html | title= Activity of Vesuvio between 1631 and 1799 | work= Esplora i Vulcani Italiani | date= 1996\u20132009 | author= Giacomelli, L. | author2= Scandone, R. | publisher= Dipartimento di Fisica E.

Her frustration is compounded by the fact that her crush, senior Jake Ryan, has no idea how she feels.\n\nAt school, she reveals her feelings about Jake in a \"sex quiz\" she tries to give her friend Randi which, unbeknownst to Sam, Jake intercepts.  Meanwhile, Jake asks his friend Rock about Sam, having noticed her looking at him in their independent study class. Rock dismisses her as an immature child, but Jake says he is frustrated by his girlfriend Caroline's partying ways.\n\nOn the [[school bus|bus]] ride home, [[geek]]y [[Ninth grade#United States|freshman]] Ted, who has a crush on Sam, repeatedly flirts with her only to have Sam reject him.\n\nAt home, Sam's day gets worse when she discovers she must sleep on the sofa because her grandparents and a [[Student exchange program|foreign exchange]] student named [[Long Duk Dong]] are all staying at the house for the wedding. Her grandparents also have forgotten her birthday and make Sam take Dong with her to a dance at school that night.\n\nAt the dance, Sam pines after Jake as he slow dances with Caroline while it doesn't take long for Dong to attract the large-breasted [[Jock (stereotype)|jock]], Marlene. Ted embarrasses Sam by dancing with her after bragging to his geek friends, Bryce and Cliff, that they are dating. When Sam runs away, the geeks bet Ted a dozen floppy disks that he can't get physical with Sam. Ted accepts, but Bryce and Cliff demand Sam's underpants as proof of his success. Jake, having seen Ted and Sam dance, asks Ted about Sam.\n\nTed finds Sam in the auto shop where she opens up to him about her family forgetting her birthday and her feelings for Jake. Ted tells her Jake asked about her and Sam excitedly asks if she should talk to Jake or wait for him to come to her. Ted, despite his feelings for Sam, encourages her to approach Jake. Before she leaves, Ted tells her about his bet and asks to borrow her [[panties]]. Later, in the boys bathroom, Bryce, Cliff, and Ted charge the other geeks one [[dollar]] to see Sam's underwear.\n\nAt Jake's house, Caroline and her friends have started a wild party.  Jake, angry with Caroline, retreats to his bedroom and tries calling Sam, but her grandparents yell at him for waking them up and tell him Sam isn't interested.  After the party ends, Jake is furious at the damage left behind. He finds Ted hiding under a glass coffee table after he angered some jocks by knocking over their beer can pyramid. Ted gives Jake Sam's underwear and tells him Sam is interested in him. Jake says he is tired of his relationship with Caroline and offers to let Ted drive a drunken Caroline home in his father's [[Rolls-Royce Corniche|Rolls Royce]].\n\nThe next morning, Sam's mother apologizes to Sam for forgetting her birthday and everyone heads to the church for the wedding. Jake arrives at Sam's house where a hungover Dong miscommunicates that Sam is at church getting married. In the church parking lot, Jake finds Caroline and Ted making out in the back of his dad's banged-up Rolls. Jake and Caroline agree to break up, but remain friends. Jake then drives to the church just in time to meet an incredulous Sam after her sister's wedding.\n\nThat night at Jake's house, Jake gives Sam her underwear and a birthday cake with 16 candles on it.  He tells her to make a wish, but she says her wish already came true. The two kiss as the film fades to black.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Molly Ringwald]] as Samantha \"Sam\" Baker\n* [[Michael Schoeffling]] as Jake Ryan\n* [[Anthony Michael Hall]] as Ted, a.k.a. \"Farmer Ted\"\n* [[Paul Dooley]] as Jim Baker\n* [[Carlin Glynn]] as Brenda Baker\n* [[Jim Carrey]] as Mike Baker\n* [[Haviland Morris]] as Caroline Mulford\n* [[Blanche Baker]] as Ginny Baker\n* [[Gedde Watanabe]] as [[Long Duk Dong]]\n* [[Edward Andrews]] as Grandpa Howard Baker\n* [[Billie Bird]] as Grandma Dorothy Baker\n* [[Carole Cook]] as Grandma Helen\n* [[Max Showalter]] as Grandpa Fred\n* [[Liane Curtis]] as Randy\n* [[John Travolta]] as Bryce\n* Darren Harris as Cliff (Wease)\n* Deborah Pollack as Marlene, a.k.a. \"Lumberjack\"\n* [[Joan Cusack]] as Geek Girl\n* [[Dustin Hoffman]] as Rudy Ryszczyk\n* [[Jami Gertz]] as Robin\n* [[Les Tremayne]] as Reverend\n* [[Zelda Rubinstein]] as Organist\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] had asked his agent for headshots of young actresses, and among those he received were those of Molly Ringwald and [[Ally Sheedy]].

Her frustration is compounded by the fact that her crush, senior Jake Ryan, has no idea how she feels.\n\nAt school, she reveals her feelings about Jake in a \"sex quiz\" she tries to give her friend Randi which, unbeknownst to Sam, Jake intercepts.  Meanwhile, Jake asks his friend Rock about Sam, having noticed her looking at him in their independent study class. Rock dismisses her as an immature child, but Jake says he is frustrated by his girlfriend Caroline's partying ways.\n\nOn the [[school bus|bus]] ride home, [[geek]]y [[Ninth grade#United States|freshman]] Ted, who has a crush on Sam, repeatedly flirts with her only to have Sam reject him.\n\nAt home, Sam's day gets worse when she discovers she must sleep on the sofa because her grandparents and a [[Student exchange program|foreign exchange]] student named [[Long Duk Dong]] are all staying at the house for the wedding. Her grandparents also have forgotten her birthday and make Sam take Dong with her to a dance at school that night.\n\nAt the dance, Sam pines after Jake as he slow dances with Caroline while it doesn't take long for Dong to attract the large-breasted [[Jock (stereotype)|jock]], Marlene. Ted embarrasses Sam by dancing with her after bragging to his geek friends, Bryce and Cliff, that they are dating. When Sam runs away, the geeks bet Ted a dozen floppy disks that he can't get physical with Sam. Ted accepts, but Bryce and Cliff demand Sam's underpants as proof of his success. Jake, having seen Ted and Sam dance, asks Ted about Sam.\n\nTed finds Sam in the auto shop where she opens up to him about her family forgetting her birthday and her feelings for Jake. Ted tells her Jake asked about her and Sam excitedly asks if she should talk to Jake or wait for him to come to her. Ted, despite his feelings for Sam, encourages her to approach Jake. Before she leaves, Ted tells her about his bet and asks to borrow her [[panties]]. Later, in the boys bathroom, Bryce, Cliff, and Ted charge the other geeks one [[dollar]] to see Sam's underwear.\n\nAt Jake's house, Caroline and her friends have started a wild party.  Jake, angry with Caroline, retreats to his bedroom and tries calling Sam, but her grandparents yell at him for waking them up and tell him Sam isn't interested.  After the party ends, Jake is furious at the damage left behind. He finds Ted hiding under a glass coffee table after he angered some jocks by knocking over their beer can pyramid. Ted gives Jake Sam's underwear and tells him Sam is interested in him. Jake says he is tired of his relationship with Caroline and offers to let Ted drive a drunken Caroline home in his father's [[Rolls-Royce Corniche|Rolls Royce]].\n\nThe next morning, Sam's mother apologizes to Sam for forgetting her birthday and everyone heads to the church for the wedding. Jake arrives at Sam's house where a hungover Dong miscommunicates that Sam is at church getting married. In the church parking lot, Jake finds Caroline and Ted making out in the back of his dad's banged-up Rolls. Jake and Caroline agree to break up, but remain friends. Jake then drives to the church just in time to meet an incredulous Sam after her sister's wedding.\n\nThat night at Jake's house, Jake gives Sam her underwear and a birthday cake with 16 candles on it.  He tells her to make a wish, but she says her wish already came true.

Streaming applications and podcasting services provide a convenient, integrated way to manage a personal consumption queue across many podcast sources and playback devices.\n\nA podcast series usually features one or more recurring hosts engaged in a discussion about a particular topic or current event. Discussion and content within a podcast can range from carefully scripted to totally improvised. Podcasts combine elaborate and artistic sound production with thematic concerns ranging from scientific research to [[Slice of life|slice-of-life]] [[journalism]]. Many podcast series provide an associated website with links and show notes, guest biographies, transcripts, additional resources, commentary, and even a community forum dedicated to discussing the show's content.\n\nThe cost to the consumer is low. While many podcasts are free to download, others are underwritten by corporations or sponsored, with the inclusion of commercial advertisements. In other cases, a podcast could also be a business venture supported by some combination of a paid subscription model, advertising or product delivered after sale.\n\nPeople are motivated to create a podcast for a number of reasons. The podcast producer, who is often the podcast host as well, may wish to express a personal passion, increase professional visibility, enter into a social network of influencers or influential ideas, cultivate a community of like-minded viewership, or put forward pedagogical or ideological ideas (possibly under philanthropic support). \n\nBecause podcast content is often free or, at the very least, affordable for the average podcast consumer, podcasting is often classified as a [[Disruptive innovation|disruptive]] [[Media (communication)|medium]], which is adverse to the maintenance of traditional [[Revenue model|revenue models]].

Streaming applications and podcasting services provide a convenient, integrated way to manage a personal consumption queue across many podcast sources and playback devices.\n\nA podcast series usually features one or more recurring hosts engaged in a discussion about a particular topic or current event. Discussion and content within a podcast can range from carefully scripted to totally improvised. Podcasts combine elaborate and artistic sound production with thematic concerns ranging from scientific research to [[Slice of life|slice-of-life]] [[journalism]]. Many podcast series provide an associated website with links and show notes, guest biographies, transcripts, additional resources, commentary, and even a community forum dedicated to discussing the show's content.\n\nThe cost to the consumer is low. While many podcasts are free to download, others are underwritten by corporations or sponsored, with the inclusion of commercial advertisements. In other cases, a podcast could also be a business venture supported by some combination of a paid subscription model, advertising or product delivered after sale.\n\nPeople are motivated to create a podcast for a number of reasons. The podcast producer, who is often the podcast host as well, may wish to express a personal passion, increase professional visibility, enter into a social network of influencers or influential ideas, cultivate a community of like-minded viewership, or put forward pedagogical or ideological ideas (possibly under philanthropic support). \n\nBecause podcast content is often free or, at the very least, affordable for the average podcast consumer, podcasting is often classified as a [[Disruptive innovation|disruptive]] [[Media (communication)|medium]], which is adverse to the maintenance of traditional [[Revenue model|revenue models]].

Like a traditional [[novel]], a podcast novel is a work of literary fiction; however it is recorded into episodes that are delivered online over a period of time. The episodes may be delivered automatically via [[RSS]] or through a website, blog, or other syndication method. Episodes can be released on a regular schedule, e.g., once a week, or irregularly as each episode is completed. In the same manner as audiobooks, podcast novels may be elaborately narrated with sound effects and separate voice actors for each character, similar to a [[Radio drama|radio play]], or they may have a single narrator and few or no sound effects.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1872381,00.html |title=Podcasting Your Novel: Publishing's Next Wave? |last=Florin |first=Hector |date=January 31, 2009 |journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}</ref>\n\nSome podcast novelists give away a free podcast version of their book as a form of promotion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Take-my-book-It-s-free-3288454.php |title=Take my book.

A community podcast can also allow members of the community (related to the podcast topic) to contribute to the podcast in many different ways. This method was first used for a series of podcasts hosted by the Regional Educational Technology Center at [[Fordham University]] in 2005.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} [[Anders Gronstedt]] explores how businesses like [[IBM]] and [[Dell EMC|EMC]] use podcasts as an employee training and communication channel.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Gronstedt |first=Anders |date=June 2007 |title=Employees Get an Earful |url=https://hbr.org/2007/06/employees-get-an-earful |journal=[[Harvard Business Review]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Gronstedt |first=Anders |date=May 3, 2007 |title=Basics of Podcasting |url=http://gronstedtgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Infoline_Gronstedt_Basics_of_Podcasting.pdf |publisher=[[Association for Talent Development|ASTD]] |isbn=978-1-56286-488-0 |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}</ref>\n\nAs of early 2019, the podcasting industry still generated little overall revenue,<ref name=\"Smith2019\">{{cite news |author1=Gerry Smith |title=Everybody Makes Podcasts.

It is overseen by a board of directors composed of Christians from both Uganda and U.S. The university is non-denominational with no denomination oversight. Historically, it was founded by missionaries associate with the [[Churches of Christ]] and [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)|Christian Churches]] in the United States to provide a high-quality university education to a remote and underserved area in East Africa. Faculty and students participate in a mentoring program and a university environment that encompass spiritual, intellectual, interpersonal, and social-cultural dimensions of human development within a diverse student body.\n\n==Location==\n\nLIU opened in January 2012 on a leased campus near the center of [[Mbale]], Uganda, by road it is approximately 250 kilometres (160&nbsp;mi) northeast of [[Kampala]], the [[capital city|capital]] and largest city in that country.[1] Its coordinates are: 1\u00b005'03.0\"N, 34\u00b010'45.0\"E (Latitude: 1.084167; Longitude: 34.179167). [2] LIU plans to occupy this leased campus until Phase 1 of the construction of the permanent campus is completed in June 2019, after which it will serve as an extension campus for evening courses and professional development programs.\n\nThe new fifty-acre campus is located just outside Mbale municipality on the main road that goes west toward Kampala. A campus master plan has been developed for the eventual construction of a campus that will serve 4,000 students. The coordinates of the permanent university campus entrance are: 1\u00b004'26.0\"N, 34\u00b006'54.0\"E (Latitude: 1.0793922; Longitude: 34.109314).\n\n==History==\nPlanning for LivingStone International University began as early as 2006. The LivingStone International University Strategic Plan 2009-2014 was completed December 19, 2007 and submitted to the Uganda National Council for Higher Education (NCHE) with the goal of being chartered as a fully accredited university by the Uganda government. The first step in this process was accomplished December 19, 2008 when the NCHE issued to LIU a Letter of Interim Authority. This allowed LIU to begin buying property, prepare curricula, hire faculty and staff and set up banking and other business tasks. LIU received its Provisional License from the NCHE in March, 2011. This prepared the way for the first student intake in January, 2012. Currently LIU is working under the guidance of the NCHE toward qualifying for a full university charter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unche.or.ug/institutions/private-universities/page/3|title=Private Universities: LivingStone International University|first=.|last=UNCHE|publisher=Uganda National Council for Higher Education (UNCHE)|date=2011|accessdate=9 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621064601/http://www.unche.or.ug/institutions/private-universities/page/3|archive-date=21 June 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOn January 16, 2012 the inaugural class of LivingStone International University began with thirty-four students. With the second intake in September 2012, the student body grew to over fifty. In 2018 its enrollment reached almost 300. As of March 2019 over $5 million has been invested into the development of LIU, the acquisition of the land, the construction of Phase 1 of the new campus, the addition of programs and schools, scholarships and operating funds for operational expenses.\n\n==Academics==\nLIU offers both bachelors and diploma programmes in five schools.

It is overseen by a board of directors composed of Christians from both Uganda and U.S. The university is non-denominational with no denomination oversight. Historically, it was founded by missionaries associate with the [[Churches of Christ]] and [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)|Christian Churches]] in the United States to provide a high-quality university education to a remote and underserved area in East Africa. Faculty and students participate in a mentoring program and a university environment that encompass spiritual, intellectual, interpersonal, and social-cultural dimensions of human development within a diverse student body.\n\n==Location==\n\nLIU opened in January 2012 on a leased campus near the center of [[Mbale]], Uganda, by road it is approximately 250 kilometres (160&nbsp;mi) northeast of [[Kampala]], the [[capital city|capital]] and largest city in that country.[1] Its coordinates are: 1\u00b005'03.0\"N, 34\u00b010'45.0\"E (Latitude: 1.084167; Longitude: 34.179167). [2] LIU plans to occupy this leased campus until Phase 1 of the construction of the permanent campus is completed in June 2019, after which it will serve as an extension campus for evening courses and professional development programs.\n\nThe new fifty-acre campus is located just outside Mbale municipality on the main road that goes west toward Kampala. A campus master plan has been developed for the eventual construction of a campus that will serve 4,000 students. The coordinates of the permanent university campus entrance are: 1\u00b004'26.0\"N, 34\u00b006'54.0\"E (Latitude: 1.0793922; Longitude: 34.109314).\n\n==History==\nPlanning for LivingStone International University began as early as 2006. The LivingStone International University Strategic Plan 2009-2014 was completed December 19, 2007 and submitted to the Uganda National Council for Higher Education (NCHE) with the goal of being chartered as a fully accredited university by the Uganda government. The first step in this process was accomplished December 19, 2008 when the NCHE issued to LIU a Letter of Interim Authority. This allowed LIU to begin buying property, prepare curricula, hire faculty and staff and set up banking and other business tasks. LIU received its Provisional License from the NCHE in March, 2011. This prepared the way for the first student intake in January, 2012. Currently LIU is working under the guidance of the NCHE toward qualifying for a full university charter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unche.or.ug/institutions/private-universities/page/3|title=Private Universities: LivingStone International University|first=.|last=UNCHE|publisher=Uganda National Council for Higher Education (UNCHE)|date=2011|accessdate=9 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621064601/http://www.unche.or.ug/institutions/private-universities/page/3|archive-date=21 June 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOn January 16, 2012 the inaugural class of LivingStone International University began with thirty-four students. With the second intake in September 2012, the student body grew to over fifty. In 2018 its enrollment reached almost 300. As of March 2019 over $5 million has been invested into the development of LIU, the acquisition of the land, the construction of Phase 1 of the new campus, the addition of programs and schools, scholarships and operating funds for operational expenses.\n\n==Academics==\nLIU offers both bachelors and diploma programmes in five schools. The five schools are: School of Business; School of Christian Ministry; School of Education; School of Computing and Information Technology; and School of Media Technology. Additional relevant future programs are planned for the near future. The university also offers a certificate course in Networking program  [Cisco] Which takes six(6) to nine(9)month.\n\n===Innovation and technology===\nEach student at LIU is issued an electronic tablet or laptop as a medium for accessing textbooks as well as receiving other instructional materials and assignments from lecturers.<ref>{{cite web|last=Muzafalu Katamba|first=and Amina Muhammed|url=http://www.observer.ug/index.php/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=15862&Itemid=106|title= Livingstone International University Takes To Hitech Learning|date=13 November 2011|accessdate=11 July 2014|publisher=[[The Observer (Uganda)]]}}</ref> There is currently a 1:5 computer-to-student ratio to provide technologically enhanced campus for the modern world that requires technological knowledge in the job market.

The HCPE were founded with the idea of combining the subjects of physical exercises and military training so that the graduates would be able to teach these subjects in gymnasiums. In 1938, HCPE were closed and their function was taken over by the Department of Physical Education established at [[Vytautas Magnus University]].\n\nIn 1945, the Lithuanian State Institute of Physical Education was founded as an independent institution. It was located in the former palace of Physical Education Base and has got the main stadium with couple of football pitches, sports hall, tennis and basketball courts. In the first year, 100 students were enrolled at the Institute. \nIn 1999, the Institute was renamed the Lithuanian Academy of Physical Education ({{lang-lt|Lietuvos k\u016bno kult\u016bros akademija}} or LKKA) by a resolution of the Parliament of Lithuania ([[Seimas]]).\n\nSince its foundation, the University has prepared about 16,000 physical education teachers, a variety of highly qualified sports coaches, physical therapy specialists, tourism and sports managers and etc. Many famous scientists, coaches and the world-famous public figures were graduated from the University.

It is in the [[swashbuckler]] genre, which has heroic, chivalrous swordsmen who fight for justice.\n\nSet between 1625 and 1628, it recounts the adventures of a young man named d'Artagnan (a character based on [[Charles de Batz-Castelmore d'Artagnan]]<!-- EDITOR'S NOTE: The \"D\" in \"d'Artagnan\" is capitalized only when at the start of a sentence-->) after he leaves home to travel to Paris, hoping  to join the [[Musketeers of the Guard]]. Although d'Artagnan is not able to join this elite corps immediately, he is befriended by the three most formidable musketeers of the age \u2013 [[Athos (fictional character)|Athos]], [[Porthos]] and [[Aramis]], \"the three inseparables\" \u2013 and becomes involved in affairs of state and at court.\n\n''The Three Musketeers'' is primarily a historical and adventure novel. However, Dumas frequently portrays various injustices, abuses, and absurdities of the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]], giving the novel an additional political significance at the time of its publication, a time when the debate in France between [[Republicanism|republican]]s and [[Monarchism|monarchists]] was still fierce. The story was first serialised from March to July 1844, during the [[July Monarchy]], four years before the [[French Revolution of 1848]] violently established the [[French Second Republic|Second Republic]].\n\nThe story of d'Artagnan is continued in ''[[Twenty Years After]]'' and ''[[The Vicomte of Bragelonne: Ten Years Later]]''.\n\n==Origin==\n[[File:Mousceteor.jpg|thumb|A [[Musketeers of the Guard|Musketeer of the Guard]] c. 1660.]]\nDumas presents his novel as one of a series of recovered manuscripts, turning the origins of his romance into a little drama of its own. In the Preface, he tells of  being inspired by a scene in ''M\u00e9moires de Monsieur d'Artagnan'' (1700), a historical novel by [[Gatien de Courtilz de Sandras]], printed by Pierre Rouge in Amsterdam, which Dumas discovered during his research for his history of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]].<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/13951 |title=Les Trois Mousquetaires by Alexandre Dumas \u2013 Free Ebook : Author's Preface |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date= 2004 |accessdate=2014-02-26}}</ref> According to Dumas, the incident where d'Artagnan tells of  his first visit to M. de Tr\u00e9ville, captain of the Musketeers, and how,  in the antechamber, he encountered  three young [[B\u00e9arn]]ese with the names Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, made such an impression on him that he continued to investigate. That much is true \u2013 the rest is fiction: He finally found the names of the three musketeers in a manuscript titled ''M\u00e9moire de M. le comte de la F\u00e8re, etc.'' Dumas \u201crequested permission\u201d to reprint the manuscript; permission was granted:\n<blockquote>Now, this is the first part of this precious manuscript which we offer to our readers, restoring it to the title which belongs to it, and entering into an engagement that if (of which we have no doubt) this first part should obtain the success it merits, we will publish the second immediately.\n\nIn the meanwhile, since godfathers are second fathers, as it were, we beg the reader to lay to our account, and not to that of the Comte de la F\u00e8re, the pleasure or the ennui he may experience.\n\nThis being understood, let us proceed with our story.<ref name='ws3muskap'>{{cite book | last = Dumas | first = Alexandre | authorlink = Alexandre Dumas | title = The Three Musketeers, Author's Preface | url = http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Three_Musketeers/Author%27s_Preface }}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n''The Three Musketeers'' was written in collaboration with [[Auguste Maquet]], who also worked with Dumas on its sequels (''[[Twenty Years After]]'' and ''[[The Vicomte of Bragelonne: Ten Years Later]]''), as well as ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]].'' Maquet would suggest plot outlines after doing historical research; Dumas then expanded the plot, removing some characters, including new ones, and imbuing the story with his unmistakable style.\n\n''The Three Musketeers'' was first published in [[Serial (literature)|serial]] form in the newspaper ''[[Le Si\u00e8cle]]'' between March and July 1844.\n\n==Plot summary==\nIn 1625 France, d'Artagnan (a poor young nobleman) leaves his family in [[Gascony]] and travels to Paris to join the [[Musketeers of the Guard]]. At a house in [[Meung-sur-Loire]], an older man derides d'Artagnan's horse. Insulted, d'Artagnan demands a duel. But the older man's companions instead beat d'Artagnan unconscious with a cooking pot and a metal tong that breaks his sword. His letter of introduction to [[M. de Tr\u00e9ville|Monsieur de Tr\u00e9ville]], the commander of the Musketeers, is also stolen. D'Artagnan resolves to avenge himself upon the older man, who is later revealed to be the [[Comte de Rochefort]], an agent of [[Cardinal Richelieu]], who is passing orders from the Cardinal to his spy, Lady de Winter, usually called [[Milady de Winter]] or simply \"Milady\".\n\nIn Paris, d'Artagnan visits Monsieur de Tr\u00e9ville at the headquarters of the Musketeers, but without the letter, Tr\u00e9ville politely refuses his application. He does, however, write a letter of introduction to an academy for young gentlemen which may prepare his visitor for recruitment at a later time. From Tr\u00e9ville's window, d'Artagnan sees Rochefort passing in the street below and rushes out of the building to confront him, but in doing so he offends three Musketeers, [[Athos (fictional character)|Athos]], [[Porthos]], and [[Aramis]], who each demand satisfaction; d'Artagnan must fight a duel with all of them that afternoon. \n\nAs d'Artagnan prepares himself for the first duel, he realizes that Athos's [[Dueling#Offense and satisfaction|seconds]] are Porthos and Aramis, who are astonished that the young Gascon intends to duel them all. As d'Artagnan and Athos begin, [[Cardinal Richelieu]]'s guards appear and attempt to arrest d'Artagnan and the three Musketeers for illegal dueling. Although they are outnumbered four to five, the four men win the battle.  D'Artagnan seriously wounds Jussac, one of the Cardinal's officers and a renowned fighter. After learning of this, King [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]] appoints d'Artagnan to Des Essart's company of the King's Guards and gives him forty [[pistole]]s.\n\n[[File:Vinkhuijzen Gardes du cardinal 02.jpg|thumb|Depiction of the Cardinal's musketeers, the great rivals of the King's musketeers.]]\n\nD'Artagnan hires a servant named Planchet, finds lodgings, and reports to Monsieur des Essart, whose company is a less prestigious regiment in which he will have to serve for two years before being considered for the Musketeers. Shortly after, his landlord speaks to him about the kidnapping of his wife, Constance Bonacieux. When she is presently released, d'Artagnan falls in [[love at first sight]] with her. She works for [[Anne of Austria|Queen Anne of France]], who is secretly conducting an affair with the English [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]]. The King, Louis XIII, gave the Queen a gift of diamond studs, but she gives them to her lover as a keepsake. Cardinal Richelieu, who wants war between France and England, plans to expose the tryst and persuades the King to demand the Queen wear the diamonds to a soir\u00e9e that the Cardinal is sponsoring. \n\nConstance tries to send her husband to London to fetch the diamonds from Buckingham, but the man is instead manipulated by Richelieu and thus does not go, so d'Artagnan and his friends intercede. En route to England, the Cardinal's henchmen repeatedly attack them and only d'Artagnan and Planchet reach London. Before arriving, d'Artagnan is compelled to assault, and nearly to kill, the Comte de Wardes, a friend of the Cardinal, cousin of Rochefort and Milady's lover. Although Milady stole two of the diamond studs, the Duke of Buckingham provides replacements while delaying the thief's return to Paris. D'Artagnan is thus able to return a complete set of jewels to Queen Anne just in time to save her honour. In gratitude, she gives him a beautiful ring.\n\nShortly afterwards, d'Artagnan begins an affair with Madame Bonacieux. Arriving for an assignation, he sees signs of a struggle and discovers that Rochefort and M. Bonacieux, acting under the orders of the Cardinal, have assaulted and imprisoned her. D'Artagnan and his friends, now recovered from their injuries, return to Paris. D'Artagnan meets [[Milady de Winter]] officially, and recognizes her as one of the Cardinal's agents, but becomes infatuated with her until her maid reveals that Milady is indifferent toward him. Entering her quarters in the dark, he pretends to be the Comte de Wardes and trysts with her. He finds a ''[[fleur-de-lis]]'' branded on Milady's shoulder, marking her as a felon. Discovering his identity, Milady attempts to kill him but d'Artagnan eludes her. He is ordered to the [[Siege of La Rochelle]].\n\nHe is informed that the Queen has rescued Constance from prison. In an inn, the musketeers overhear the Cardinal asking Milady to murder the Duke of Buckingham, a supporter of the Protestant rebels at La Rochelle who has sent troops to assist them. Richelieu gives her a letter that excuses her actions as under orders from the Cardinal himself, but Athos takes it. The next morning, Athos bets that he, d'Artagnan, Porthos, and Aramis, and their servants can hold the recaptured St. Gervais bastion against the rebels for an hour, for the purpose of discussing their next course of action. They resist for an hour and a half before retreating, killing 22 Rochellese in total; d'Artagnan is made a Musketeer as a result of this feat. \n\nThey warn Lord de Winter and the Duke of Buckingham. Milady is imprisoned on arrival in England, but she seduces her guard, Felton (a fictionalization of the real [[John Felton (assassin)|John Felton]]), and persuades him to allow her escape and to kill Buckingham himself. On her return to France, Milady hides in a convent where Constance is also staying. The na\u00efve Constance clings to Milady, who sees a chance for revenge on d'Artagnan, and fatally poisons Constance before d'Artagnan can rescue her. The Musketeers arrest Milady before she reaches Cardinal Richelieu. They bring an official executioner, put her on trial and sentence her to death. \n\nAfter her execution, the four friends return to the Siege of La Rochelle. The Comte de Rochefort arrests d'Artagnan and takes him to the Cardinal. When questioned about Milady's execution, d'Artagnan presents her letter of pardon as his own. Impressed with d'Artagnan's wilfulness and secretly glad to be rid of Milady, the Cardinal destroys the letter and writes a new order, giving the bearer a promotion to lieutenant in the Tr\u00e9ville company of Musketeers, leaving the name blank. D'Artagnan offers the letter to Athos, Porthos, and Aramis in turn but each refuses it; Athos because it is below him, Porthos because he is retiring to marry his wealthy mistress, and Aramis because he is joining the priesthood. D'Artagnan, though heartbroken and full of regrets, finally receives the promotion he had coveted.\n\n== Characters==\n\n;Musketeers\n \n*[[Athos (character)|Athos]] \u2013 Comte de la F\u00e8re: he has never recovered from his marriage to Milady and seeks solace in wine.  He becomes a [[father figure]] to d'Artagnan.\n*[[Aramis]] \u2013 Ren\u00e9 d'Herblay, a handsome young man who hesitates between his religious calling and his fondness for women and scheming. \n*[[Porthos]] \u2013  M. du Vallon: a [[dandy]], fond of fashionable clothes and keen to make a fortune for himself.  The least cerebral of the quartet, he compensates with his homeric strength of body and character.  \n*[[Charles de Batz de Castelmore d'Artagnan#Portrayals in fiction|D'Artagnan]] \u2013  Charles de Batz de Castelmore d'Artagnan: a young, foolhardy, brave and clever man seeking to become a musketeer in France. \n;Musketeers' servants\n*Planchet \u2013 a young man from [[Picardy]], he is seen by Porthos on the [[Pont de la Tournelle]] spitting into the river below. Porthos takes this as a sign of good character and hires him on the spot to serve d'Artagnan. He turns out to be a brave, intelligent and loyal servant.\n*Grimaud \u2013 a [[Breton people|Breton]]. Athos is a strict master, and only permits his servant to speak in emergencies; he mostly communicates through sign language.\n*Mousqueton \u2013 originally a [[Normandy|Norman]] named Boniface; Porthos, however, changes his name to one that sounds better. He is a would-be dandy, just as vain as his master. In lieu of pay, he is clothed and lodged in a manner superior to that usual for servants, dressing grandly in his master's old clothes.\n*Bazin \u2013 from the province of [[Berry (province)|Berry]], Bazin is a pious man who waits for the day his master (Aramis) will join the church, as he has always dreamed of serving a priest.\n\n;Others\n*[[Milady de Winter]] \u2013 a beautiful and evil spy of the Cardinal, she is also Athos's ex-wife. D'Artagnan impersonates a rival to spend a night with her, attracting her deadly hatred.\n*[[Comte de Rochefort|Rochefort]] is a more conventional agent of the Cardinal.  Following their duel on the road to Paris, d'Artagnan swears to have his revenge.  He loses several opportunities, but their paths finally cross again towards the end of the novel.\n*Constance Bonacieux \u2013 the Queen's seamstress and confidante.  After d'Artagnan rescues her from the Cardinal's guard, he immediately falls in love with her. She appreciates his protection, but the relationship is never consummated.\n*Monsieur Bonacieux \u2013 Constance's husband.  He initially enlists d'Artagnan's help to rescue his wife from the Cardinal's guards, but when he himself is arrested, he and the Cardinal discover they have an understanding.  Richelieu turns Monsieur Bonacieux against his wife, and he goes on to play a role in her abduction.\n*Kitty \u2013 a servant of Milady de Winter.  She dislikes her mistress and adores d'Artagnan.\n*Lord Winter \u2013 brother of Milady's second husband, who died of a mysterious disease (apparently poisoned by Milady). He imprisoned Milady upon her arrival in England and decided to send her overseas in exile. Later, he took part in Milady's trial.\n\n;Historical characters\n*King [[Louis XIII of France]]: presented by Dumas as a fairly weak monarch often manipulated by his chief minister.\n*Queen [[Anne of Austria]] \u2013 the unhappy Queen of France.\n* [[Cardinal Richelieu]]: Armand Jean du Plessis, the King's chief minister, who plots against the Queen in resentment at having his advances rebuffed.  Dumas describes him as being \"36 or 37\" though in 1625 Richelieu was 40.  \n*[[M. de Tr\u00e9ville]] \u2013 captain of The Musketeers, and something of a mentor to d'Artagnan, though he has only a minor role.\n*[[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham]] - a handsome and charismatic man used to getting his way: he thinks nothing of starting a war between England and France for his personal convenience.  His courtship of Anne of Austria gets her in trouble.\n*[[John Felton (assassin)|John Felton]] \u2013 a puritan officer assigned to guard Milady and warned about her ways, he is nonetheless seduced and fooled by her in a matter of days and assassinates Buckingham at her request.\n\n==Editions==\n''Les Trois Mousquetaires'' was translated into three English versions by 1846. One of these, by William Barrow (1817\u20131877), is still in print and fairly faithful to the original, available in the Oxford World's Classics 1999 edition. To conform to 19th-century English standards, all of the explicit and many of the implicit references to sexuality were removed, adversely affecting the readability of several scenes, such as the scenes between d'Artagnan and Milady.\n\nOne recent English translation is by [[Richard Pevear]] (2006), who, though applauding Barrow's work, states that most of the modern translations available today are \"textbook examples of bad translation practices\" which \"give their readers an extremely distorted notion of Dumas' writing\".<ref>Dumas, Alexandre ''The Three Musketeers'', Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition, \"A Note on the Translation\", page xxi</ref>\n\n==Adaptations==\n\n===Film===\n{{Main|The Three Musketeers in film}}\n\n*''The Three Musketeers'', a 1948 adaptation starring [[Van Heflin]], [[Lana Turner]], [[June Allyson]], [[Angela Lansbury]], and [[Gene Kelly]] <ref>{{cite_web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040876/|accessdate=4 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n*''The Three Musketeers'', a 1993 Disney adaptation starring [[Charlie Sheen]], [[Kiefer Sutherland]], [[Oliver Platt]] and [[Chris O'Donnell]].<ref>{{cite_web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040876/|title=The Three Musketeers|accessdate=4 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Television===\nThe novel has been adapted also for television in live-action and animation.\n\n====Live-action====\nThe BBC has adapted the novel on three occasions.\n*''The Three Musketeers'', a 1954 BBC adaptation in six 30-minute episodes, starring [[Laurence Payne]], [[Roger Delgado]], [[Paul Whitsun-Jones]] and Paul Hansard\n*''The Three Musketeers'', a 1966 BBC adaptation in ten 25-minute episodes, directed by [[Peter Hammond (actor)|Peter Hammond]] and starring [[Jeremy Brett]], [[Jeremy Young]], and [[Brian Blessed]]\n* ''[[The Musketeers]]'', a 2014 series by [[Adrian Hodges]], is the newest BBC adaptation<ref>{{cite web|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2012/08/01/one-for-all-bbc-announces-new-show-the-musketeers/|title=One for all: BBC announces new show 'The Musketeers'|last=Strecker|first=Erin|date=1 August 2012|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=1 August 2012}}</ref> starring [[Tom Burke (actor)|Tom Burke]], [[Santiago Cabrera]], [[Howard Charles]] and [[Luke Pasqualino]] as the titular musketeers.\n\nThe ''[[Young Blades]]'' is an American/Canadian television series that aired on [[Ion Television|PAX]] on 2005.

A sequel, ''The Return of Dogtanian'', was released in 1989 by [[BRB Internacional]], [[Thames Television]] and [[Wang Film Productions]]. Set 10 years after of the original, it's loosely based on the novel ''[[The Vicomte de Bragelonne]]''. A key difference between the two ''Dogtanian'' adaptions and Dumas' novel is that the character traits of [[Athos (fictional character)|Athos]] and [[Porthos]] were interchanged, making Athos the extrovert and Porthos the secretive noble of the group.\n\nIn 1989, Gakken produced a new anime adaptation called ''[[The Three Musketeers Anime]]'', this time with human characters, which features several departures from the original.\n\n''[[The Three Musketeers (cartoon)|The Three Musketeers]]'' was a series of animated shorts produced by [[Hanna-Barbera]]'s as part of ''[[The Banana Splits]] Comedy-Adventure Hour'' and ''The Banana Splits & Friends'' show.\n\n''[[Albert the Fifth Musketeer]]'' is a 1994 French animated series featuring a new musketeer, the titular Albert.\n\n''[[Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers]]'', a direct-to-video animated movie produced by [[Walt Disney Pictures]] and the Australian office of [[DisneyToon Studios]], directed by [[Donovan Cook]], and released on August 17, 2004.\n\nA Barbie adaption of the tale by the name of ''[[Barbie and the Three Musketeers]]'' was made in 2009.\n\n===Stage===\nThe first stage production was in Dumas' own lifetime as the opera ''Les Trois Mousquetaires'' with a [[libretto]] by Dumas himself and music by [[Albert Visetti]].\n\n''[[The Three Musketeers (musical)|The Three Musketeers]]'' is a musical with a book by [[William Anthony McGuire]], lyrics by Clifford Grey and [[P.

''[[The Three Mouseketeers]]'' was the title of two series produced by [[DC Comics]]; [[The Three Mouseketeers#Golden Age version|the first series]] was a loose parody of ''The Three Musketeers''.\n\nIn 1939, American author [[Tiffany Thayer]] published a book titled ''Three Musketeers'' (Thayer, 1939).  This is a re-telling of the story in Thayer's words, true to the original plot but told in a different order and with different points of view and emphasis from the original. The [[Khaavren Romances]] by [[Steven Brust]] are fantasy (or science-fiction) novels heavily influenced by  ''The Three Musketeers'' and its sequels; the characters and social background are closer to Dumas's than the plots.\n\n[[Sarah Hoyt]] wrote a series of [[Historical whodunnit|Historical Murder mysteries]] with the Musketeers as the protagonists. (Hoyt wrote the novels under the name Sarah d'Almeida.)\n\n[[Tansy Rayner Roberts]] wrote ''Musketeer Space'', a [[space opera]] retelling of the original book in which almost all characters have a different gender, as a weekly serialized novel from 2014\u20132016.\n\n==In popular culture==\n\n'''Literature'''\n\nIn the book ''[[The Assault]]'', The Three Musketeers is quoted in the Prologue as the protagonist had the story read to him by Mr. Beumer, a lawyer who later becomes senile and in morbidity.\n\n'''Film and television'''\n\nIn the movie ''[[The Man in the Iron Mask (1998 film)|The Man in the Iron Mask]]'' the aging musketeers\ncome out of retirement and reunite to save France from the spoiled, cruel young king Louis XIV (played by [[Leonardo DiCaprio]]). The movie features [[Jeremy Irons]] as Aramis, [[John Malkovich]] as Athos, [[Gerard Depardieu]] as Porthos, and [[Gabriel Byrne]] as D\u2019Artagnon.\n\nIn ''[[Slumdog Millionaire]]'' Jamal Malik's final question was to correctly identify the name of the third musketeer- which was Aramis. Jamal did so and won twenty million rupees.\n\nIn the movie [[Django Unchained]] one of the slaves, owned by Calvin Candie, [[Leonardo Dicaprio]], is named D'Artangonn.\n\n\n'''Video Games'''\n\nIn ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Black and White]]'', the Pok\u00e9mon [[Terrakion]], [[Cobalion]], and [[List of generation V Pok\u00e9mon|Virizion]] are based on the Three Musketeers. Cobalion represents Athos, Terrakion represents Porthos, and Verizion represents Aramis.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lavacutcontent.com/ken-sugimori-nintendo-dream-2/|title=Ken Sugimori Reveals More Gen 5 Lost Pokemon Designs|date=2019-05-31|website=Lava Cut Content|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-23}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n{{Wikisource|The Three Musketeers|''The Three Musketeers''}}\n{{Gutenberg|no=1257|name=The Three Musketeers}}.

It is in the [[swashbuckler]] genre, which has heroic, chivalrous swordsmen who fight for justice.\n\nSet between 1625 and 1628, it recounts the adventures of a young man named d'Artagnan (a character based on [[Charles de Batz-Castelmore d'Artagnan]]<!-- EDITOR'S NOTE: The \"D\" in \"d'Artagnan\" is capitalized only when at the start of a sentence-->) after he leaves home to travel to Paris, hoping  to join the [[Musketeers of the Guard]]. Although d'Artagnan is not able to join this elite corps immediately, he is befriended by the three most formidable musketeers of the age \u2013 [[Athos (fictional character)|Athos]], [[Porthos]] and [[Aramis]], \"the three inseparables\" \u2013 and becomes involved in affairs of state and at court.\n\n''The Three Musketeers'' is primarily a historical and adventure novel. However, Dumas frequently portrays various injustices, abuses, and absurdities of the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]], giving the novel an additional political significance at the time of its publication, a time when the debate in France between [[Republicanism|republican]]s and [[Monarchism|monarchists]] was still fierce. The story was first serialised from March to July 1844, during the [[July Monarchy]], four years before the [[French Revolution of 1848]] violently established the [[French Second Republic|Second Republic]].\n\nThe story of d'Artagnan is continued in ''[[Twenty Years After]]'' and ''[[The Vicomte of Bragelonne: Ten Years Later]]''.\n\n==Origin==\n[[File:Mousceteor.jpg|thumb|A [[Musketeers of the Guard|Musketeer of the Guard]] c. 1660.]]\nDumas presents his novel as one of a series of recovered manuscripts, turning the origins of his romance into a little drama of its own. In the Preface, he tells of  being inspired by a scene in ''M\u00e9moires de Monsieur d'Artagnan'' (1700), a historical novel by [[Gatien de Courtilz de Sandras]], printed by Pierre Rouge in Amsterdam, which Dumas discovered during his research for his history of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]].<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/13951 |title=Les Trois Mousquetaires by Alexandre Dumas \u2013 Free Ebook : Author's Preface |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date= 2004 |accessdate=2014-02-26}}</ref> According to Dumas, the incident where d'Artagnan tells of  his first visit to M. de Tr\u00e9ville, captain of the Musketeers, and how,  in the antechamber, he encountered  three young [[B\u00e9arn]]ese with the names Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, made such an impression on him that he continued to investigate. That much is true \u2013 the rest is fiction: He finally found the names of the three musketeers in a manuscript titled ''M\u00e9moire de M. le comte de la F\u00e8re, etc.'' Dumas \u201crequested permission\u201d to reprint the manuscript; permission was granted:\n<blockquote>Now, this is the first part of this precious manuscript which we offer to our readers, restoring it to the title which belongs to it, and entering into an engagement that if (of which we have no doubt) this first part should obtain the success it merits, we will publish the second immediately.\n\nIn the meanwhile, since godfathers are second fathers, as it were, we beg the reader to lay to our account, and not to that of the Comte de la F\u00e8re, the pleasure or the ennui he may experience.\n\nThis being understood, let us proceed with our story.<ref name='ws3muskap'>{{cite book | last = Dumas | first = Alexandre | authorlink = Alexandre Dumas | title = The Three Musketeers, Author's Preface | url = http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Three_Musketeers/Author%27s_Preface }}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n''The Three Musketeers'' was written in collaboration with [[Auguste Maquet]], who also worked with Dumas on its sequels (''[[Twenty Years After]]'' and ''[[The Vicomte of Bragelonne: Ten Years Later]]''), as well as ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]].'' Maquet would suggest plot outlines after doing historical research; Dumas then expanded the plot, removing some characters, including new ones, and imbuing the story with his unmistakable style.\n\n''The Three Musketeers'' was first published in [[Serial (literature)|serial]] form in the newspaper ''[[Le Si\u00e8cle]]'' between March and July 1844.\n\n==Plot summary==\nIn 1625 France, d'Artagnan (a poor young nobleman) leaves his family in [[Gascony]] and travels to Paris to join the [[Musketeers of the Guard]]. At a house in [[Meung-sur-Loire]], an older man derides d'Artagnan's horse. Insulted, d'Artagnan demands a duel. But the older man's companions instead beat d'Artagnan unconscious with a cooking pot and a metal tong that breaks his sword. His letter of introduction to [[M. de Tr\u00e9ville|Monsieur de Tr\u00e9ville]], the commander of the Musketeers, is also stolen. D'Artagnan resolves to avenge himself upon the older man, who is later revealed to be the [[Comte de Rochefort]], an agent of [[Cardinal Richelieu]], who is passing orders from the Cardinal to his spy, Lady de Winter, usually called [[Milady de Winter]] or simply \"Milady\".\n\nIn Paris, d'Artagnan visits Monsieur de Tr\u00e9ville at the headquarters of the Musketeers, but without the letter, Tr\u00e9ville politely refuses his application. He does, however, write a letter of introduction to an academy for young gentlemen which may prepare his visitor for recruitment at a later time. From Tr\u00e9ville's window, d'Artagnan sees Rochefort passing in the street below and rushes out of the building to confront him, but in doing so he offends three Musketeers, [[Athos (fictional character)|Athos]], [[Porthos]], and [[Aramis]], who each demand satisfaction; d'Artagnan must fight a duel with all of them that afternoon. \n\nAs d'Artagnan prepares himself for the first duel, he realizes that Athos's [[Dueling#Offense and satisfaction|seconds]] are Porthos and Aramis, who are astonished that the young Gascon intends to duel them all. As d'Artagnan and Athos begin, [[Cardinal Richelieu]]'s guards appear and attempt to arrest d'Artagnan and the three Musketeers for illegal dueling. Although they are outnumbered four to five, the four men win the battle.  D'Artagnan seriously wounds Jussac, one of the Cardinal's officers and a renowned fighter. After learning of this, King [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]] appoints d'Artagnan to Des Essart's company of the King's Guards and gives him forty [[pistole]]s.\n\n[[File:Vinkhuijzen Gardes du cardinal 02.jpg|thumb|Depiction of the Cardinal's musketeers, the great rivals of the King's musketeers.]]\n\nD'Artagnan hires a servant named Planchet, finds lodgings, and reports to Monsieur des Essart, whose company is a less prestigious regiment in which he will have to serve for two years before being considered for the Musketeers. Shortly after, his landlord speaks to him about the kidnapping of his wife, Constance Bonacieux. When she is presently released, d'Artagnan falls in [[love at first sight]] with her. She works for [[Anne of Austria|Queen Anne of France]], who is secretly conducting an affair with the English [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]]. The King, Louis XIII, gave the Queen a gift of diamond studs, but she gives them to her lover as a keepsake. Cardinal Richelieu, who wants war between France and England, plans to expose the tryst and persuades the King to demand the Queen wear the diamonds to a soir\u00e9e that the Cardinal is sponsoring. \n\nConstance tries to send her husband to London to fetch the diamonds from Buckingham, but the man is instead manipulated by Richelieu and thus does not go, so d'Artagnan and his friends intercede. En route to England, the Cardinal's henchmen repeatedly attack them and only d'Artagnan and Planchet reach London. Before arriving, d'Artagnan is compelled to assault, and nearly to kill, the Comte de Wardes, a friend of the Cardinal, cousin of Rochefort and Milady's lover. Although Milady stole two of the diamond studs, the Duke of Buckingham provides replacements while delaying the thief's return to Paris. D'Artagnan is thus able to return a complete set of jewels to Queen Anne just in time to save her honour. In gratitude, she gives him a beautiful ring.\n\nShortly afterwards, d'Artagnan begins an affair with Madame Bonacieux. Arriving for an assignation, he sees signs of a struggle and discovers that Rochefort and M. Bonacieux, acting under the orders of the Cardinal, have assaulted and imprisoned her. D'Artagnan and his friends, now recovered from their injuries, return to Paris. D'Artagnan meets [[Milady de Winter]] officially, and recognizes her as one of the Cardinal's agents, but becomes infatuated with her until her maid reveals that Milady is indifferent toward him. Entering her quarters in the dark, he pretends to be the Comte de Wardes and trysts with her. He finds a ''[[fleur-de-lis]]'' branded on Milady's shoulder, marking her as a felon. Discovering his identity, Milady attempts to kill him but d'Artagnan eludes her. He is ordered to the [[Siege of La Rochelle]].\n\nHe is informed that the Queen has rescued Constance from prison. In an inn, the musketeers overhear the Cardinal asking Milady to murder the Duke of Buckingham, a supporter of the Protestant rebels at La Rochelle who has sent troops to assist them. Richelieu gives her a letter that excuses her actions as under orders from the Cardinal himself, but Athos takes it. The next morning, Athos bets that he, d'Artagnan, Porthos, and Aramis, and their servants can hold the recaptured St. Gervais bastion against the rebels for an hour, for the purpose of discussing their next course of action. They resist for an hour and a half before retreating, killing 22 Rochellese in total; d'Artagnan is made a Musketeer as a result of this feat. \n\nThey warn Lord de Winter and the Duke of Buckingham. Milady is imprisoned on arrival in England, but she seduces her guard, Felton (a fictionalization of the real [[John Felton (assassin)|John Felton]]), and persuades him to allow her escape and to kill Buckingham himself. On her return to France, Milady hides in a convent where Constance is also staying. The na\u00efve Constance clings to Milady, who sees a chance for revenge on d'Artagnan, and fatally poisons Constance before d'Artagnan can rescue her. The Musketeers arrest Milady before she reaches Cardinal Richelieu. They bring an official executioner, put her on trial and sentence her to death. \n\nAfter her execution, the four friends return to the Siege of La Rochelle. The Comte de Rochefort arrests d'Artagnan and takes him to the Cardinal. When questioned about Milady's execution, d'Artagnan presents her letter of pardon as his own. Impressed with d'Artagnan's wilfulness and secretly glad to be rid of Milady, the Cardinal destroys the letter and writes a new order, giving the bearer a promotion to lieutenant in the Tr\u00e9ville company of Musketeers, leaving the name blank. D'Artagnan offers the letter to Athos, Porthos, and Aramis in turn but each refuses it; Athos because it is below him, Porthos because he is retiring to marry his wealthy mistress, and Aramis because he is joining the priesthood. D'Artagnan, though heartbroken and full of regrets, finally receives the promotion he had coveted.\n\n== Characters==\n\n;Musketeers\n \n*[[Athos (character)|Athos]] \u2013 Comte de la F\u00e8re: he has never recovered from his marriage to Milady and seeks solace in wine.

Athos is a strict master, and only permits his servant to speak in emergencies; he mostly communicates through sign language.\n*Mousqueton \u2013 originally a [[Normandy|Norman]] named Boniface; Porthos, however, changes his name to one that sounds better. He is a would-be dandy, just as vain as his master. In lieu of pay, he is clothed and lodged in a manner superior to that usual for servants, dressing grandly in his master's old clothes.\n*Bazin \u2013 from the province of [[Berry (province)|Berry]], Bazin is a pious man who waits for the day his master (Aramis) will join the church, as he has always dreamed of serving a priest.\n\n;Others\n*[[Milady de Winter]] \u2013 a beautiful and evil spy of the Cardinal, she is also Athos's ex-wife.

She dislikes her mistress and adores d'Artagnan.\n*Lord Winter - brother of Milady's second husband, who died of a mysterious disease (apparently poisoned by Milady).

Dumas describes him as being \"36 or 37\" though in 1625 Richelieu was 40.  \n*[[M. de Tr\u00e9ville]] \u2013 captain of The Musketeers, and something of a mentor to d'Artagnan, though he has only a minor role.\n*[[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham]] - a handsome and charismatic man used to getting his way: he thinks nothing of starting a war between England and France for his personal convenience.  His courtship of Anne of Austria gets her in trouble.\n*[[John Felton (assassin)|John Felton]] \u2013 a puritan officer assigned to guard Milady and warned about her ways, he is nonetheless seduced and fooled by her in a matter of days and assassinates Buckingham at her request.\n\n==Editions==\n''Les Trois Mousquetaires'' was translated into three English versions by 1846. One of these, by William Barrow (1817\u20131877), is still in print and fairly faithful to the original, available in the Oxford World's Classics 1999 edition. To conform to 19th-century English standards, all of the explicit and many of the implicit references to sexuality were removed, adversely affecting the readability of several scenes, such as the scenes between d'Artagnan and Milady.\n\nOne recent English translation is by [[Richard Pevear]] (2006), who, though applauding Barrow's work, states that most of the modern translations available today are \"textbook examples of bad translation practices\" which \"give their readers an extremely distorted notion of Dumas' writing\".<ref>Dumas, Alexandre ''The Three Musketeers'', Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition, \"A Note on the Translation\", page xxi</ref>\n\n==Adaptations==\n\n===Film===\n{{Main|The Three Musketeers in film}}\n\n*''The Three Musketeers'', a 1948 adaptation starring [[Van Heflin]], [[Lana Turner]], [[June Allyson]], [[Angela Lansbury]], and [[Gene Kelly]] <ref>{{cite_web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040876/|accessdate=4 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n*''The Three Musketeers'', a 1993 Disney adaptation starring [[Charlie Sheen]], [[Kiefer Sutherland]], [[Oliver Platt]] and [[Chris O'Donnell]].<ref>{{cite_web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040876/|title=The Three Musketeers|accessdate=4 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Television===\nThe novel has been adapted also for television in live-action and animation.\n\n====Live-action====\nThe BBC has adapted the novel on three occasions.\n*''The Three Musketeers'', a 1954 BBC adaptation in six 30-minute episodes, starring [[Laurence Payne]], [[Roger Delgado]], [[Paul Whitsun-Jones]] and Paul Hansard\n*''The Three Musketeers'', a 1966 BBC adaptation in ten 25-minute episodes, directed by [[Peter Hammond (actor)|Peter Hammond]] and starring [[Jeremy Brett]], [[Jeremy Young]], and [[Brian Blessed]]\n* ''[[The Musketeers]]'', a 2014 series by [[Adrian Hodges]], is the newest BBC adaptation<ref>{{cite web|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2012/08/01/one-for-all-bbc-announces-new-show-the-musketeers/|title=One for all: BBC announces new show 'The Musketeers'|last=Strecker|first=Erin|date=1 August 2012|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=1 August 2012}}</ref> starring [[Tom Burke (actor)|Tom Burke]], [[Santiago Cabrera]], [[Howard Charles]] and [[Luke Pasqualino]] as the titular musketeers.\n\nThe ''[[Young Blades]]'' is an American/Canadian television series that aired on [[Ion Television|PAX]] on 2005. It's a sequel to the novels, centered on the son of d'Artagnan, played by [[Tobias Mehler]].\n\n====Animation====\n[[Walt Disney Productions]] produced a [[Silly Symphony]] cartoon called, ''[[Three Blind Mouseketeers]]'', which is loosely based on the novel in 1936, in which the characters are depicted as anthropomorphic animals.\n\n''[[Dogtanian and the Three Muskehounds]]'' is a 1981 Spanish\u2013Japanese [[anime]] adaptation, where the characters are [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] dogs. A sequel, ''The Return of Dogtanian'', was released in 1989 by [[BRB Internacional]], [[Thames Television]] and [[Wang Film Productions]]. Set 10 years after of the original, it's loosely based on the novel ''[[The Vicomte de Bragelonne]]''.

''[[The Three Mouseketeers]]'' was the title of two series produced by [[DC Comics]]; [[The Three Mouseketeers#Golden Age version|the first series]] was a loose parody of ''The Three Musketeers''.\n\nIn 1939, American author [[Tiffany Thayer]] published a book titled ''Three Musketeers'' (Thayer, 1939).  This is a re-telling of the story in Thayer's words, true to the original plot but told in a different order and with different points of view and emphasis from the original. The [[Khaavren Romances]] by [[Steven Brust]] are fantasy (or science-fiction) novels heavily influenced by  ''The Three Musketeers'' and its sequels; the characters and social background are closer to Dumas's than the plots.\n\n[[Sarah Hoyt]] wrote a series of [[Historical whodunnit|Historical Murder mysteries]] with the Musketeers as the protagonists. (Hoyt wrote the novels under the name Sarah d'Almeida.)\n\n[[Tansy Rayner Roberts]] wrote ''Musketeer Space'', a [[space opera]] retelling of the original book in which almost all characters have a different gender, as a weekly serialized novel from 2014\u20132016.\n\n==In popular culture==\n\n'''Literature'''\n\nIn the book ''[[The Assault]]'', The Three Musketeers is quoted in the Prologue as the protagonist had the story read to him by Mr. Beumer, a lawyer who later becomes senile and in morbidity.\n\n'''Film and television'''\n\nIn the movie ''[[The Man in the Iron Mask (1998 film)|The Man in the Iron Mask]]'' the aging musketeers\ncome out of retirement and reunite to save France from the spoiled, cruel young king Louis XIV (played by [[Leonardo DiCaprio]]).

As the presence and expression zinc transporter gene families are highly prevalent in hyperaccumulators, the capacity to accumulate a wide range of heavy metals is likely due to an inability of the zinc transporters to discriminate against certain metal ions. The response of the plants to hyperaccumulation of any metal also supports this theory as it has been observed that AhHMHA3 is expressed in hyperaccumulating individuals.

Salt. \"Functional activity and role of cation-efflux family members in Ni hyperaccumulation in Thlaspi goesingense.\" Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 98.17 (2001): 9995-10000</ref> It has been observed in hyperaccumulating species, that these genes, specifically ZNT1 and ZNT2 alleles are chronically overexpressed.<ref name=\"Assun\u00e7\u00e3o, A.

L., et al. \"Elevated expression of metal transporter genes in three accessions of the metal hyperaccumulator Thlaspi caerulescens.\" Plant, Cell & Environment 24.2 (2001): 217-226.</ref>\n\nWhile the exact mechanism by which these genes facilitate hyperaccumulation is not yet characterized, expression patterns correlate heavily with individual hyperaccumulation capacity and metal exposure, suggesting these gene families play a regulatory role.  As the presence and expression zinc transporter gene families are highly prevalent in hyperaccumulators, the capacity to accumulate a wide range of heavy metals is likely due to an inability of the zinc transporters to discriminate against certain metal ions. The response of the plants to hyperaccumulation of any metal also supports this theory as it has been observed that AhHMHA3 is expressed in hyperaccumulating individuals. AhHMHA3 has been identified to be expressed in response to and aid of Zn detoxification.<ref name=\"C. Pagliano, 2006 pp. 70\"/> In another study, using metallophytic and non-metallophytic ''Arabidopsis'' populations, back crosses indicated [[pleiotropy]] between Cd and Zn tolerances.<ref name=\"Bert, V. 2003\">Bert, V., Meerts, P., Saumitou-Laprade, P. et al. Plant and Soil (2003) 249: 9. doi:10.1023/A:1022580325301</ref>  This response suggests that plants are unable to detect specific metals, and that hyperaccumulation is likely a result of an overexpressed Zn transportation system.<ref name=\"Pollard, A.

In one hypothesis, \"the elemental defense hypothesis\", provided by Poschenrieder, it is suggested that the expression of these genes assist in [[antiherbivory]] or pathogen defenses by making tissues toxic to organisms attempting to feed on that plant.<ref name=\"Poschenrieder C. 2006\"/> Another hypothesis, \"the joint hypothesis\", provided by Boyd, suggests that expression of these genes assists in systemic defense.<ref name=\"Boyd R.
