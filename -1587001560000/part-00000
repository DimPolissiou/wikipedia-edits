It offers a four-year professional degree program that leads to the PharmD, the highest level of professional education in pharmacy, which is approved by the [[Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education]] as the sole entry level degree for the profession. Besides the professional degree, the College also offers programs leading to six master's degrees and four doctorate degrees, covering a spectrum of research areas within the pharmaceutical sciences.\n\n== History ==\nEstablished in 1859, the UIC College of Pharmacy stands as the oldest academic unit of the [[University of Illinois]], borne out of pharmaceutical education efforts begun in Chicago in 1840. That winter, John T. Temple delivered a public course of lectures in chemistry. By 1843, the series was supplemented by regular courses in chemistry at [[Rush Medical College]]. At the time, most academic institutions had little to offer pharmacists and chemists other than lecture courses. In 1852, the first railroad entered Chicago from the East, increasing the flow of goods, including medicines, through Chicago. Also in 1852, the [[American Pharmaceutical Association]] (now known as the [[American Pharmacists Association]]) formed to advance pharmaceutical knowledge and elevate the professional character of apothecaries and druggists throughout the United States. APhA founders felt this could not be accomplished without first developing a formalized education system. In 1853, APhA issued a letter inquiring into the state of pharmacy as it existed in the various sections of the country. A correspondent member was appointed for Illinois, resulting in a rapid series of advances in professional pharmacy.\n\n[[File:Chicago College of Pharmacy U of I.jpg|thumb|The Chicago College of Pharmacy was founded in 1859 and became part of the University of Illinois in the later part of the century.]]At the sixth annual meeting of [[American Pharmacists Association|APhA]], four Chicago druggists were elected to membership in the society. Upon returning to Chicago, two of those men, Edwin Gale and James D. Paine, began a movement for a formal school of pharmacy. Along with S.S. Bliss, J.H. Read, E.H. Sargent and F. Scammon, all prominent druggists, collaborated to form an organization that would become the College's foundation. Incidentally, the group also served as the first organized society of druggists in the state.\n\nShortly thereafter, a formal movement towards establishing a school of pharmacy was begun, and the Chicago College of Pharmacy was born. On Sept. 12, 1859, the charter signed by the original founders of the institution was notarized, officially establishing Illinois' first school of pharmacy and the sixth school of pharmacy in the nation. Scammon was elected chairman and Sargent was appointed to the College's board of trustees. Its first complete course was delivered in the winter of 1859, and 1861 marked its first graduating class of two students.\n\nOn Sunday, Oct. 8, 1871, at 9:40&nbsp;p.m., a fire alarm was sounded in a Chicago pharmacy, the alert of the [[Great Chicago Fire]]. Lasting two days, the fire's wrath ravaged through 34 city blocks and destroyed nearly 20,000 buildings, including the Chicago College of Pharmacy. Corresponding College Secretary and alumnus Albert Ebert began rallying support from colleagues around the world to help rebuild the College and restock its bookshelves and laboratories. Its reopening heralded a class of 37 students in the fall semester of 1872.\n\nThe years that followed were crucial for both the College and the pharmacy profession. Concerns surrounding the safety and ethics of pharmacy practice emerged. Nationwide efforts sprang forth to develop laws regulating the profession. By 1880, the College had been instrumental in forming the Illinois Pharmaceutical Association (now known as the Illinois Pharmacists Association). A year later, the Pharmacy Law of 1881 was passed, mandating education requirements for the practice of pharmacy in Illinois and assigning supervision of the professional to state agencies. Candidates were required to pass an examination given by the State Board of Health. The law also required pharmacists to pay a $2 annual licensing fee.\n\nIn 1895, state legislature amended the original charter for the University of Illinois, allowing the location of professional departments of law, medicine, dentistry and pharmacy outside of [[Champaign County, Illinois|Champaign County]]. On Dec. 10, 1895, the proposal to acquire the Chicago College of Pharmacy came before the university board of trustees. On May 1, 1896, the College formally united with the University of Illinois, creating the University of Illinois School of Pharmacy.\n\n== Reputation ==\n[[File:UICCollegeOfPharmacyWoodStreet.jpg|thumb|UIC College of Pharmacy at 833 South Wood Street in Chicago, Illinois, photographed in 2010.]]\nThe UIC College of Pharmacy is a unit with the University of Illinois.  The College is considered among the top colleges of pharmacy for scholarship, curriculum, and the quality of faculty and students. ''[[U.S. News and World Report]]'' ranks UIC as the sixth best<ref>[http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-health-schools/pharmacy-rankings \"Best Graduate Schools\"], ''U.S. News & World Report'', 2016.</ref> among colleges of pharmacy in the United States.\n\nAs of FY2010, the College of Pharmacy ranked third in overall federal funding for research, e.g., [[National Institutes of Health]], of 122 U.S. colleges of pharmacy.<ref>[http://www.aacp.org/resources/research/institutionalresearch/Pages/NIH.aspx \"American Association of College of Pharmacy\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101104232922/http://www.aacp.org/resources/research/institutionalresearch/Pages/NIH.aspx |date=2010-11-04 }}, American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy, 2010.</ref> College of Pharmacy-sponsored research programs reached $30 million in fiscal year 2010 (funding doubled in 5 years).\n\n== Rockford Campus ==\n[[File:Twilight 4849 re1.jpg|thumb|The UIC College of Pharmacy at Rockford is housed in the University of Illinois Health Sciences Center.]]\nIn fall 2010, the UIC College of Pharmacy opened the doors of its first regional campus in Rockford. Housed in a newly constructed addition to the existing University of Illinois College of Medicine at Rockford building, the University of Illinois College of Pharmacy at Rockford offers a new program designed to specifically prepare pharmacists for practice within the rural areas that comprise the majority of Illinois: The Rural Pharmacy Education Program (RPHarm).<ref>[http://www.uic.edu/pharmacy/rockford/Rural_Pharmacy_Progr.php \"UIC College of Pharmacy Rural Pharmacy Education Program\"], University of Illinois at Chicago, 2010.</ref> This program recruits students from rural, medically underserved regions of the state and educates them in aspects of rural health and pharmacy. RPharm students will train inter-professionally with medical students during their four years at Rockford in order to develop collaborative practices applicable in these rural areas.\n\n== Academic programs ==\nThe US Department of Education and the [[Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education]] is responsible for accreditation of the College of Pharmacy. ACPE is the national agency for the accreditation of professional degree programs in pharmacy and providers of continuing pharmacy education. ACPE was established in 1932 for the accreditation of pre-service education, and in 1975 its scope of activity was broadened to include accreditation of providers of continuing pharmacy education.\n\n=== Academics ===\nThe College of Pharmacy offers post-PharmD PG1 and PGY2 residencies in a wide variety of areas in addition to research fellowship opportunities.\n\nThe Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) program is designed for students who want to become licensed, practicing pharmacists. The UIC program is highly competitive, and admits around 160 new students each year. The program take four years to complete. There are specific undergraduate courses that must be completed to qualify for admission to pharmacy school.\n\nThe College of Pharmacy offers PhD programs in biopharmaceutical sciences, medicinal chemistry, pharmacognosy and pharmacy administration. In 2011, the college awarded 162 professional degrees, 15 doctorate degrees and 16 master's degrees.<ref>[http://www.uic.edu/pharmacy/education/graduate_program.php \"UIC College of Pharmacy Graduate Programs\"], University of Illinois at Chicago, 2011.</ref>\n\nThe Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) degree is the highest level of professional education in pharmacy and has been approved by the [[Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education]] (ACPE) as the sole entry level degree for the profession.\n\nThe college has four PhD programs, covering a spectrum of research areas within the pharmaceutical sciences. Three of these programs have specialization tracks, reflecting additional specialization within the overall degree program, the research interests of the faculty and future employment opportunities. The graduate programs generally line up with the academic departments in the college.\n\nThe college offers two stand-alone MS degrees: [[Forensic science]] and [[forensic toxicology]].\n\n===Doctor of Philosophy Programs===\nBiopharmaceutical sciences: Research in the biopharmaceutical sciences involves pharmaceutics (drug delivery), pharmacodynamics (drug action), pharmacokinetics (absorption and distribution properties) and pharmacogenomics. Specific research programs include: Lipid and polymer-based drug delivery systems, targeted drug delivery, pharmacokinetic membrane transport and absorption, behavioral pharmacology, cardiovascular pharmacology, neuropharmacology, environmental toxicology, cancer chemotherapy.\n\nPharmacy (pharmacy administration): Pharmacy administration is a dynamic field that applies approaches from management science, economics, and the social sciences to issues in health care that relate to pharmacy, pharmacists, and pharmaceuticals. Specific research programs include: patient outcomes, health care and pharmaceutical policy, comparative health care systems, consumer medication use safety, pharmacoeconomics and management, rational drug use and distribution, socioeconomic and cultural issues related to drug use.\n\nMedicinal Chemistry: Research in [[medicinal chemistry]] involves design, synthesis, structure elucidation, and analysis of synthetic compounds possessing biological (potential drug) activity. Specific research programs include: Synthetic chemistry directed toward neurodegenerative and oncologic diseases, computational approaches to drug design, chemical toxicology and biological mechanisms, synthetic development of enzyme inhibitors and low molecular weight catalysts, natural product structure elucidation.\n\nPharmacognosy: Research in [[pharmacognosy]] involves the isolation, structure elucidation and bioassay of plant and other natural product compounds having potential applications as treatments or preventives. Specific research programs include: chemotherapeutic and chemopreventive properties of natural products, structure elucidation of bioactive natural products and their mechanism of action, development of methods for the analysis of botanical dietary supplements, use of traditional medicines by indigenous groups.\n\n===Combined Degree Programs===\nPharmD/PhD: Students enrolled in this program can pursue the PharmD simultaneously with any of the PhD degree offerings. The joint program is highly competitive and designed for select students who have interests in both the clinical aspects of pharmacy and research in the pharmaceutical sciences. With judicious selection and timing of courses, joint program participants can earn both degrees in less overall time than would be required to complete the degrees separately.\n\nPharmD/MS in health informatics: This joint degree program integrates pharmacy science and clinical practice with health informatics, the goal being identification, collection, processing and management of information to support pharmacy practice, administration, education and research. It promotes the expansion of pharmacy knowledge and leadership and is an important new dimension of pharmacy practice. Students in this joint program learn to identify the social issues that inhibit the effective use of information technology in health care and to apply creative solutions that address these issues.\n\nPharmD/MS in clinical and translational science: Graduates of the MS-CTS program train to learn skills which will allow them to direct a broad range of clinical studies, including the translation of scientific knowledge into clinical practice, and will be able to interact with all of the complementary disciplines with which clinical investigators need to collaborate.\n\n===Master of Science Degree Programs===\nMaster of science degrees are offered in biopharmaceutical sciences, medicinal chemistry, pharmacognosy and pharmacy administration.\nThe college also offers two stand-alone M.S. degrees: forensic science and forensic toxicology.\n\n===Online Degrees===\nThe Department of Pharmacy Systems, Outcomes and Policy offers two online degrees. The certificate of Pharmacoepidemiology taught in coordination with the UIC School of Public Health,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pharmacy.uic.edu/departments/pharmacy-systems-outcomes-policy/pharmacoepidemiology-certificate|title=Pharmacoepidemiology Certificate {{!}} College of Pharmacy {{!}} University of Illinois at Chicago|website=pharmacy.uic.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-05-18}}</ref> and the master's degree in Comparative Effectiveness Research.\n\n== Admissions ==\nAlthough not required, nearly 70 percent of applicants to the PharmD program hold a bachelor's degree prior to admission. To earn the PharmD, students complete a minimum of six years of study: The first two years of prepharmacy coursework can be accomplished at any accredited college or university, the final four years of professional education are completed at the UIC College of Pharmacy. High school students may seek admission to the College of Pharmacy through UIC's Guaranteed Professional Program Admissions initiative; these students are required to successfully complete their prepharmacy coursework at UIC prior to entry into the College of Pharmacy.\n\nEach graduate (MS/PhD) program has its own admissions requirements and handles its own admissions process. Applicants must apply for admission to a specific program.\nMany graduate programs only admit candidates in the fall semester of each year.\n\nThe college offers a PharmD/PhD program, in which the professional doctor of pharmacy degree can be earned simultaneously with any of the PhDs offered. Through judicious selection and timing of courses, both degrees can be completed in less overall time than would be required to complete the programs separately.\nSome graduate programs permit applications to the master of science degree, usually from students who have the intention of continuing on to the PhD. The department of biopharmaceutical sciences does not admit to the MS.\n\n== Research ==\nUIC College of Pharmacy researchers are internationally recognized leaders in alternative, complementary and traditional medicine; biotechnology and biodefense; cancer biology and therapeutics; drug discovery, development and delivery; infectious diseases; natural products; neuroscience; patient safety; pharmacoeconomics; genomics and pharmacogenomics.\n\nIn the National Institutes of Health's (NIH) fiscal year 2016, the college's total reportable research funding was $18.5M. This places the college in 5th place nationwide for overall research dollars. For The following fiscal year, the college reported $21.15M in awards to the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy.\n\n== Departments ==\n\nMore than 80 research and clinical faculty conduct research and provide training to more than 160 graduate students and postdoctoral trainees, as well as 650 professional students. Departments in the College of Pharmacy are organized around four major areas of the pharmaceutical sciences: \n* Biopharmaceutical Sciences\n* Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacognosy\n* Pharmacy Practice\n* Pharmacy Systems, Outcomes and Policy\n\n== Centers and institutes ==\nIn addition to its major departmental divisions, the college is home to several specialized research centers and institutes:\n\n* Center for Pharmaceutical Biotechnology\n* Center for Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomic Research\n* Drug Information Group\n* Institute for Tuberculosis Research\n* Pharmacogenomics Laboratory\n* Program for Collaborative Research in the Pharmaceutical Sciences\n* International Cooperative Biodiversity Group\n* UIC/NIH Center for Botanical Dietary Supplements Research\n* World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Traditional Medicine\n\n== Clinical programs ==\nIn addition to educational activities, the College provides highly regarded clinical and distributive services to patients at the University of Illinois Medical Center at Chicago. The college's service function, coupled with its educational programs, provides UIC pharmacy students with maximum exposure to contemporary pharmacy practice. Inpatient, outpatient and satellite pharmacies in community health centers engage UIC pharmacy students in many unique experiences throughout their academic career.\n\nAcademic institutions, research facilities and even governments seek out the expertise and opportunities for collaboration with the College. The works of pharmacy students, fellows and faculty members continue to influence and help advance the practice of pharmacy in worldwide locations such as Greece, Hong Kong, Iraq, Peru and Thailand. Meanwhile, international research collaborations, presentations and publications continuously add momentum to global drug discovery efforts.\n\n== Community outreach ==\nGuided by its mission to serve the pharmaceutical care needs of society through education, patient care, research and public service, the college interacts with Chicago-area communities through numerous patient-oriented service commitments. Each year, faculty members conduct numerous community outreach initiatives, many of which occur in areas where residents do not speak English as a first language. Pharmacy students participate in a variety of civic and charitable outreach projects, including helping to administer immunizations in the UIC community and consulting with patients to identify the best choices in Medicare drug benefits.\n\nLocated in the Illinois Medical District, the world's largest concentration of advanced health care facilities, the College provides educational and collaborative opportunities at nearby District member institutions, including Cook County Hospital, the West Side Veterans Administration Hospital and Rush St. Luke's Presbyterian Medical Center.\n\nMuch like the multi-cultural population of Chicago, ethnic and racial majorities are nonexistent among UIC pharmacy students. The College reflects the diverse composition of its host city as well as the UIC patients it serves.\n\n== Urban Health Program ==\nThe UIC Urban Health Program was established in 1978 by the Illinois Board of Higher Education to respond to the disparity in the quality and access of health care in underserved minority populations in Chicago's inner city. The Urban Health Program's overall purpose is to expand opportunities for health professions education for underrepresented groups and to improve the quality of health care services for medically underserved urban populations. The UHP effort was designed to increase enrollment and graduation of underrepresented minorities\u2014Blacks, Latinos, and Native Americans\u2014who are interested in pursuing a health professions education. The intent is to recruit from urban communities with the hope that the majority of the students would return to these communities to practice.\n\nUrban Health Program components include student recruitment, student retention, financial aid, academic and personal advising, and academic enrichment programs for grades four through 12. UHP encompasses the six health sciences colleges (pharmacy, applied health sciences, dentistry, medicine, nursing, and the School of Public Health), the Graduate College and the Early Outreach program.\n\n== Urban Pipeline Program ==\nThrough its investigation of the issue of low representation of underrepresented minority students in pharmacy school, the College concluded that this disparity was due to a lack of exposure among minority elementary and high school students to the profession.<ref name=Framework>Clara Awe and Jerry Bauman, \"Theoretical and Conceptual Framework Model for Success,\" PubMed Central, 2010</ref> To address these issues, the College and the Chicago Public Schools Department of College and Career Preparation partnered with industry leaders to offer a comprehensive pharmacy program for high school students with the goal to cultivate the next generation of URM pharmacists.<ref>[http://www.uic.edu/pharmacy/depts/Urban_Health_Programs/Goals_and_Objectives.php \" UIC College of Pharmacy Urban Pipeline Program Goals and Objectives\"], University of Illinois at Chicago, 2011.</ref>\n\nThe Urban Pipeline Program is an eight-week, comprehensive, academic, experiential, mentoring and professional- and social-development summer enrichment program.<ref>[http://www.uic.edu/pharmacy/depts/Urban_Health_Programs/Pathways_to_Pharmacy_Program/Pathways_to_Pharmacy.php \" UIC College of Pharmacy Urban Pipeline Program\"], University of Illinois at Chicago, 2011.</ref> Guiding the program is the \"Theoretical and Conceptual Framework Model for Success\"<ref name=Framework/> that was developed by drawing from the literature on higher education student success and further informed by the Educational Policy Institute's Pathways to College Network Framework.\n\n== Notable alumni ==\n*[[Arthur A.

''[[U.S. News and World Report]]'' ranks UIC as the sixth best<ref>[http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-health-schools/pharmacy-rankings \"Best Graduate Schools\"], ''U.S. News & World Report'', 2016.</ref> among colleges of pharmacy in the United States.\n\nAs of FY2010, the College of Pharmacy ranked third in overall federal funding for research, e.g., [[National Institutes of Health]], of 122 U.S. colleges of pharmacy.<ref>[http://www.aacp.org/resources/research/institutionalresearch/Pages/NIH.aspx \"American Association of College of Pharmacy\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101104232922/http://www.aacp.org/resources/research/institutionalresearch/Pages/NIH.aspx |date=2010-11-04 }}, American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy, 2010.</ref> College of Pharmacy-sponsored research programs reached $30 million in fiscal year 2010 (funding doubled in 5 years).\n\n== Rockford Campus ==\n[[File:Twilight 4849 re1.jpg|thumb|The UIC College of Pharmacy at Rockford is housed in the University of Illinois Health Sciences Center.]]\nIn fall 2010, the UIC College of Pharmacy opened the doors of its first regional campus in Rockford. Housed in a newly constructed addition to the existing University of Illinois College of Medicine at Rockford building, the University of Illinois College of Pharmacy at Rockford offers a new program designed to specifically prepare pharmacists for practice within the rural areas that comprise the majority of Illinois: The Rural Pharmacy Education Program (RPHarm).<ref>[http://www.uic.edu/pharmacy/rockford/Rural_Pharmacy_Progr.php \"UIC College of Pharmacy Rural Pharmacy Education Program\"], University of Illinois at Chicago, 2010.</ref> This program recruits students from rural, medically underserved regions of the state and educates them in aspects of rural health and pharmacy. RPharm students will train inter-professionally with medical students during their four years at Rockford in order to develop collaborative practices applicable in these rural areas.\n\n== Academic programs ==\nThe US Department of Education and the [[Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education]] is responsible for accreditation of the College of Pharmacy. ACPE is the national agency for the accreditation of professional degree programs in pharmacy and providers of continuing pharmacy education. ACPE was established in 1932 for the accreditation of pre-service education, and in 1975 its scope of activity was broadened to include accreditation of providers of continuing pharmacy education.\n\n=== Academics ===\nThe College of Pharmacy offers post-PharmD PG1 and PGY2 residencies in a wide variety of areas in addition to research fellowship opportunities.\n\nThe Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) program is designed for students who want to become licensed, practicing pharmacists. The UIC program is highly competitive, and admits around 160 new students each year. The program take four years to complete. There are specific undergraduate courses that must be completed to qualify for admission to pharmacy school.\n\nThe College of Pharmacy offers PhD programs in biopharmaceutical sciences, medicinal chemistry, pharmacognosy and pharmacy administration. In 2011, the college awarded 162 professional degrees, 15 doctorate degrees and 16 master's degrees.<ref>[http://www.uic.edu/pharmacy/education/graduate_program.php \"UIC College of Pharmacy Graduate Programs\"], University of Illinois at Chicago, 2011.</ref>\n\nThe Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) degree is the highest level of professional education in pharmacy and has been approved by the [[Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education]] (ACPE) as the sole entry level degree for the profession.\n\nThe college has four PhD programs, covering a spectrum of research areas within the pharmaceutical sciences. Three of these programs have specialization tracks, reflecting additional specialization within the overall degree program, the research interests of the faculty and future employment opportunities. The graduate programs generally line up with the academic departments in the college.\n\nThe college offers two stand-alone MS degrees: [[Forensic science]] and [[forensic toxicology]].\n\n===Doctor of Philosophy Programs===\nBiopharmaceutical sciences: Research in the biopharmaceutical sciences involves pharmaceutics (drug delivery), pharmacodynamics (drug action), pharmacokinetics (absorption and distribution properties) and pharmacogenomics. Specific research programs include: Lipid and polymer-based drug delivery systems, targeted drug delivery, pharmacokinetic membrane transport and absorption, behavioral pharmacology, cardiovascular pharmacology, neuropharmacology, environmental toxicology, cancer chemotherapy.\n\nPharmacy (pharmacy administration): Pharmacy administration is a dynamic field that applies approaches from management science, economics, and the social sciences to issues in health care that relate to pharmacy, pharmacists, and pharmaceuticals. Specific research programs include: patient outcomes, health care and pharmaceutical policy, comparative health care systems, consumer medication use safety, pharmacoeconomics and management, rational drug use and distribution, socioeconomic and cultural issues related to drug use.\n\nMedicinal Chemistry: Research in [[medicinal chemistry]] involves design, synthesis, structure elucidation, and analysis of synthetic compounds possessing biological (potential drug) activity. Specific research programs include: Synthetic chemistry directed toward neurodegenerative and oncologic diseases, computational approaches to drug design, chemical toxicology and biological mechanisms, synthetic development of enzyme inhibitors and low molecular weight catalysts, natural product structure elucidation.\n\nPharmacognosy: Research in [[pharmacognosy]] involves the isolation, structure elucidation and bioassay of plant and other natural product compounds having potential applications as treatments or preventives. Specific research programs include: chemotherapeutic and chemopreventive properties of natural products, structure elucidation of bioactive natural products and their mechanism of action, development of methods for the analysis of botanical dietary supplements, use of traditional medicines by indigenous groups.\n\n===Combined Degree Programs===\nPharmD/PhD: Students enrolled in this program can pursue the PharmD simultaneously with any of the PhD degree offerings. The joint program is highly competitive and designed for select students who have interests in both the clinical aspects of pharmacy and research in the pharmaceutical sciences. With judicious selection and timing of courses, joint program participants can earn both degrees in less overall time than would be required to complete the degrees separately.\n\nPharmD/MS in health informatics: This joint degree program integrates pharmacy science and clinical practice with health informatics, the goal being identification, collection, processing and management of information to support pharmacy practice, administration, education and research. It promotes the expansion of pharmacy knowledge and leadership and is an important new dimension of pharmacy practice. Students in this joint program learn to identify the social issues that inhibit the effective use of information technology in health care and to apply creative solutions that address these issues.\n\nPharmD/MS in clinical and translational science: Graduates of the MS-CTS program train to learn skills which will allow them to direct a broad range of clinical studies, including the translation of scientific knowledge into clinical practice, and will be able to interact with all of the complementary disciplines with which clinical investigators need to collaborate.\n\n===Master of Science Degree Programs===\nMaster of science degrees are offered in biopharmaceutical sciences, medicinal chemistry, pharmacognosy and pharmacy administration.\nThe college also offers two stand-alone M.S. degrees: forensic science and forensic toxicology.\n\n===Online Degrees===\nThe Department of Pharmacy Systems, Outcomes and Policy offers two online degrees. The certificate of Pharmacoepidemiology taught in coordination with the UIC School of Public Health,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pharmacy.uic.edu/departments/pharmacy-systems-outcomes-policy/pharmacoepidemiology-certificate|title=Pharmacoepidemiology Certificate {{!}} College of Pharmacy {{!}} University of Illinois at Chicago|website=pharmacy.uic.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-05-18}}</ref> and the master's degree in Comparative Effectiveness Research.\n\n== Admissions ==\nAlthough not required, nearly 70 percent of applicants to the PharmD program hold a bachelor's degree prior to admission. To earn the PharmD, students complete a minimum of six years of study: The first two years of prepharmacy coursework can be accomplished at any accredited college or university, the final four years of professional education are completed at the UIC College of Pharmacy. High school students may seek admission to the College of Pharmacy through UIC's Guaranteed Professional Program Admissions initiative; these students are required to successfully complete their prepharmacy coursework at UIC prior to entry into the College of Pharmacy.\n\nEach graduate (MS/PhD) program has its own admissions requirements and handles its own admissions process. Applicants must apply for admission to a specific program.\nMany graduate programs only admit candidates in the fall semester of each year.\n\nThe college offers a PharmD/PhD program, in which the professional doctor of pharmacy degree can be earned simultaneously with any of the PhDs offered. Through judicious selection and timing of courses, both degrees can be completed in less overall time than would be required to complete the programs separately.\nSome graduate programs permit applications to the master of science degree, usually from students who have the intention of continuing on to the PhD. The department of biopharmaceutical sciences does not admit to the MS.\n\n== Research ==\nUIC College of Pharmacy researchers are internationally recognized leaders in alternative, complementary and traditional medicine; biotechnology and biodefense; cancer biology and therapeutics; drug discovery, development and delivery; infectious diseases; natural products; neuroscience; patient safety; pharmacoeconomics; genomics and pharmacogenomics.\n\nIn the National Institutes of Health's (NIH) fiscal year 2016, the college's total reportable research funding was $18.5M. This places the college in 5th place nationwide for overall research dollars. For The following fiscal year, the college reported $21.15M in awards to the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy.\n\n== Departments ==\n\nMore than 80 research and clinical faculty conduct research and provide training to more than 160 graduate students and postdoctoral trainees, as well as 650 professional students. Departments in the College of Pharmacy are organized around four major areas of the pharmaceutical sciences: \n* Biopharmaceutical Sciences\n* Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacognosy\n* Pharmacy Practice\n* Pharmacy Systems, Outcomes and Policy\n\n== Centers and institutes ==\nIn addition to its major departmental divisions, the college is home to several specialized research centers and institutes:\n\n* Center for Pharmaceutical Biotechnology\n* Center for Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomic Research\n* Drug Information Group\n* Institute for Tuberculosis Research\n* Pharmacogenomics Laboratory\n* Program for Collaborative Research in the Pharmaceutical Sciences\n* International Cooperative Biodiversity Group\n* UIC/NIH Center for Botanical Dietary Supplements Research\n* World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Traditional Medicine\n\n== Clinical programs ==\nIn addition to educational activities, the College provides highly regarded clinical and distributive services to patients at the University of Illinois Medical Center at Chicago. The college's service function, coupled with its educational programs, provides UIC pharmacy students with maximum exposure to contemporary pharmacy practice. Inpatient, outpatient and satellite pharmacies in community health centers engage UIC pharmacy students in many unique experiences throughout their academic career.\n\nAcademic institutions, research facilities and even governments seek out the expertise and opportunities for collaboration with the College. The works of pharmacy students, fellows and faculty members continue to influence and help advance the practice of pharmacy in worldwide locations such as Greece, Hong Kong, Iraq, Peru and Thailand. Meanwhile, international research collaborations, presentations and publications continuously add momentum to global drug discovery efforts.\n\n== Community outreach ==\nGuided by its mission to serve the pharmaceutical care needs of society through education, patient care, research and public service, the college interacts with Chicago-area communities through numerous patient-oriented service commitments. Each year, faculty members conduct numerous community outreach initiatives, many of which occur in areas where residents do not speak English as a first language. Pharmacy students participate in a variety of civic and charitable outreach projects, including helping to administer immunizations in the UIC community and consulting with patients to identify the best choices in Medicare drug benefits.\n\nLocated in the Illinois Medical District, the world's largest concentration of advanced health care facilities, the College provides educational and collaborative opportunities at nearby District member institutions, including Cook County Hospital, the West Side Veterans Administration Hospital and Rush St. Luke's Presbyterian Medical Center.\n\nMuch like the multi-cultural population of Chicago, ethnic and racial majorities are nonexistent among UIC pharmacy students. The College reflects the diverse composition of its host city as well as the UIC patients it serves.\n\n== Urban Health Program ==\nThe UIC Urban Health Program was established in 1978 by the Illinois Board of Higher Education to respond to the disparity in the quality and access of health care in underserved minority populations in Chicago's inner city. The Urban Health Program's overall purpose is to expand opportunities for health professions education for underrepresented groups and to improve the quality of health care services for medically underserved urban populations. The UHP effort was designed to increase enrollment and graduation of underrepresented minorities\u2014Blacks, Latinos, and Native Americans\u2014who are interested in pursuing a health professions education. The intent is to recruit from urban communities with the hope that the majority of the students would return to these communities to practice.\n\nUrban Health Program components include student recruitment, student retention, financial aid, academic and personal advising, and academic enrichment programs for grades four through 12. UHP encompasses the six health sciences colleges (pharmacy, applied health sciences, dentistry, medicine, nursing, and the School of Public Health), the Graduate College and the Early Outreach program.\n\n== Urban Pipeline Program ==\nThrough its investigation of the issue of low representation of underrepresented minority students in pharmacy school, the College concluded that this disparity was due to a lack of exposure among minority elementary and high school students to the profession.<ref name=Framework>Clara Awe and Jerry Bauman, \"Theoretical and Conceptual Framework Model for Success,\" PubMed Central, 2010</ref> To address these issues, the College and the Chicago Public Schools Department of College and Career Preparation partnered with industry leaders to offer a comprehensive pharmacy program for high school students with the goal to cultivate the next generation of URM pharmacists.<ref>[http://www.uic.edu/pharmacy/depts/Urban_Health_Programs/Goals_and_Objectives.php \" UIC College of Pharmacy Urban Pipeline Program Goals and Objectives\"], University of Illinois at Chicago, 2011.</ref>\n\nThe Urban Pipeline Program is an eight-week, comprehensive, academic, experiential, mentoring and professional- and social-development summer enrichment program.<ref>[http://www.uic.edu/pharmacy/depts/Urban_Health_Programs/Pathways_to_Pharmacy_Program/Pathways_to_Pharmacy.php \" UIC College of Pharmacy Urban Pipeline Program\"], University of Illinois at Chicago, 2011.</ref> Guiding the program is the \"Theoretical and Conceptual Framework Model for Success\"<ref name=Framework/> that was developed by drawing from the literature on higher education student success and further informed by the Educational Policy Institute's Pathways to College Network Framework.\n\n== Notable alumni ==\n*[[Arthur A.

They can often be eroded by [[urban rural fringe]] uses and sometimes, development 'jumps' over the green belt area, resulting in the creation of \"satellite towns\" which, although separated from the city by green belt, function more like suburbs than independent communities.\n\n==History==\nThe [[Old Testament]] outlines a proposal for a green belt around the [[Levite]] towns in the [[Land of Israel]].<ref>Numbers 35:1\u20135</ref> Moses [[Maimonides]] expounded that the greenbelt plan from the Old Testament referred to all towns in ancient Israel.<ref>Mishna Torah, Zeraim, Shmittah & Yovel 13:4\u20135</ref> In the 7th century, [[Muhammad]] established a green belt around [[Medina]].

Green belt policy was then pioneered in the [[United Kingdom]] confronted with ongoing [[rural flight]]. Various proposals were put forward from 1890 onwards but the first to garner widespread support was put forward by the [[London Society]] in its \"Development Plan of Greater London\" 1919. Alongside the [[Campaign to Protect Rural England|CPRE]] they lobbied for a continuous belt (of up to two miles wide) to prevent urban sprawl, beyond which new development could occur.\n\nThere are fourteen green belt areas in the UK covering 16,716&nbsp;km\u00b2 or 13% of England, and 164&nbsp;km\u00b2 of [[Scotland]]; for a detailed discussion of these, see [[Green belt (United Kingdom)|Green belt (UK)]].

In a protracted housing shortage, reduction of the Green Belt is one of the possible solutions.  All such solutions may be resisted however by private [[landlords]] who profit from a scarcity of housing, for example by lobbying to restrain new housing across the city. The stated motivation and benefits of the green belt might be well-intentioned (public health, social gardening and agriculture, environment), but inadequately realised relative to other solutions.\n\nInherently partial critics include [[Mark Pennington]] and the economics-heavy think tanks such as the [[Institute of Economic Affairs]]<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">[http://www.iea.org.uk/publications/research/liberating-the-land-the-case-for-private-land-use-planning Liberating the Land: The Case for Private Land-Use Planning | Institute of Economic Affairs].

Such studies focus on widely inherent limitations of Green Belts.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>  In most examples only a small fraction of the population uses the green belt for leisure purposes.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> The IEA study claims that a green belt is not strongly causally linked to clean air and water.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> Rather, they view the ultimate result of the decision to green-belt a city as one to prevent housing demand within the zone to be met with supply,<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> thus exacerbating high housing prices and stifling competitive forces in general. <!-- This paragraph could be a lot clearer and shorter without so much marxist baggage --><!--I completely agree. I have just kept that in for balance with the positives highlighted in the more informative article on peri-urban agriculture, with a mention of farming and gardening which was completely left out somehow-->\n\n===Increasing urban sprawl===\nAnother area of criticism comes from the fact that, since a greenbelt does not extend indefinitely outside a city, it spurs the growth of areas much further away from the city core than if it had not existed, thereby actually ''increasing'' [[urban sprawl]].<ref>How Much Open Space is Enough?\" St. Paul Pioneer Press (MN) \u2013 April 22, 2007 \u2013 A1 MAIN</ref> Examples commonly cited are the [[Ottawa]] suburbs of [[Kanata, Ontario|Kanata]] and [[Orl\u00e9ans, Ontario|Orleans]], both of which are outside the city's greenbelt, and are currently undergoing explosive growth (see [[Greenbelt (Ottawa)]]). This leads to other problems, as residents of these areas have a longer commute to work places in the city and worse access to [[public transport]]. It also means people have to commute through the green belt, an area not designed to cope with high levels of transportation. Not only is the merit of a green belt subverted, but the green belt may heighten the problem and make the city unsustainable.\n\nThere are many examples whereby the actual effect of green belts is to act as a land reserve for future freeways and other highways. Examples include sections of the 407 highway north of Toronto and the Hunt Club Rd./Richmond Rd. south of Ottawa. Whether they are originally planned as such, or the result of a newer administration taking advantage of land that was left available by its predecessors is debatable.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n{{main|Green belt (United Kingdom)}}\nGreen belts were established in England from 1955 to simply prevent the physical growth of large built-up areas; to prevent neighboring cities and towns from merging.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the City|last=Caves|first=R. W.|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=318}}</ref>  In the UK, greenbelt around the major conurbations has been criticized as one of the main protectionist bars to building housing, the others being other planning restrictions (Local Plans and [[restrictive covenant]]s) and developers' [[land banking]]. Local Plans and land banking are to be relaxed for home building in the 2015-2030 period by law and the green belt will be reduced by some local authorities as each local authority must now consider it among the available shortlisted options in drawing development plans to meet higher housing targets. Critics argue that the greenbelts defeat their stated objective of saving the countryside and open spaces. Such criticism falls short when considering the other, broader benefits such as [[peri-urban agriculture]] which includes gardening and carries many benefits, especially to the retired. It also ignores the strategic aims of the [[Attlee Ministry]] in 1946, just as in France, of shifting capital away from the capital city (addressing regional disparity) and avoiding intra-urban gridlock.  The restrictions of the Green Belt were particularly in the 1940s-1980s mitigated with planned, government-supported, new towns under the [[New Towns Act 1946]] and [[New Towns Act 1981]]. These saw establishment beyond the greenbelts of new homes, [[infrastructure]], businesses and other facilities.  Without large scale sustainable development, [[infill development]] sees urban green space lost. A chronic housing shortage with inadequate new settlements and/or extension of those outside of the green belt and/or no green belt reduction has seen many brownfield sites, often well-suited to industry and commerce, lost in existing conurbations.<ref>''Political Barriers To Housebuilding In Britain: A Critical Case Study Of Protectionism & Its Industrial-Commercial Effects'', Industrial Systems Research/ Google Books, revised electronic edition 2013.

Similar concepts are '''[[greenway (landscape)|greenways]]''' or '''green wedges''' which have a linear character and may run through an urban area instead of around it. In essence, a green belt is an invisible line designating a border around a certain area, preventing development of the area and allowing wildlife to return and be established.\n\n==Purposes==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}\nIn those countries which have them, the stated objectives of green belt policy are to:\n* Protect natural or semi-[[natural environment]]s;\n* Improve [[air quality]] within [[urban area|urban]] areas;\n* Ensure that urban dwellers have access to countryside, with consequent educational and recreational opportunities; and\n* Protect the unique character of [[rural]] communities that might otherwise be absorbed by expanding [[suburbs]].\n\nThe green belt has many benefits for people:\n* Walking, camping, and biking areas close to the cities and towns.\n* Contiguous [[habitat]] network for wild [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s and [[wildlife]].\n* Cleaner air and water\n* Better land use of areas within the bordering cities.\n\nThe effectiveness of green belts differs depending on location and country. They can often be eroded by [[urban rural fringe]] uses and sometimes, development 'jumps' over the green belt area, resulting in the creation of \"satellite towns\" which, although separated from the city by green belt, function more like suburbs than independent communities.\n\n==History==\nThe [[Old Testament]] outlines a proposal for a green belt around the [[Levite]] towns in the [[Land of Israel]].<ref>Numbers 35:1\u20135</ref> Moses [[Maimonides]] expounded that the greenbelt plan from the Old Testament referred to all towns in ancient Israel.<ref>Mishna Torah, Zeraim, Shmittah & Yovel 13:4\u20135</ref> In the 7th century, [[Muhammad]] established a green belt around [[Medina]].

Green belt policy was then pioneered in the [[United Kingdom]] confronted with ongoing [[rural flight]]. Various proposals were put forward from 1890 onwards but the first to garner widespread support was put forward by the [[London Society]] in its \"Development Plan of Greater London\" 1919. Alongside the [[Campaign to Protect Rural England|CPRE]] they lobbied for a continuous belt (of up to two miles wide) to prevent urban sprawl, beyond which new development could occur.\n\nThere are fourteen green belt areas in the UK covering 16,716&nbsp;km\u00b2 or 13% of England, and 164&nbsp;km\u00b2 of [[Scotland]]; for a detailed discussion of these, see [[Green belt (United Kingdom)|Green belt (UK)]].

In a protracted housing shortage, reduction of the Green Belt is one of the possible solutions.  All such solutions may be resisted however by private [[landlords]] who profit from a scarcity of housing, for example by lobbying to restrain new housing across the city. The stated motivation and benefits of the green belt might be well-intentioned (public health, social gardening and agriculture, environment), but inadequately realised relative to other solutions.\n\nInherently partial critics include [[Mark Pennington]] and the economics-heavy think tanks such as the [[Institute of Economic Affairs]]<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">[http://www.iea.org.uk/publications/research/liberating-the-land-the-case-for-private-land-use-planning Liberating the Land: The Case for Private Land-Use Planning | Institute of Economic Affairs].

Such studies focus on widely inherent limitations of Green Belts.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>  In most examples only a small fraction of the population uses the green belt for leisure purposes.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> The IEA study claims that a green belt is not strongly causally linked to clean air and water.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> Rather, they view the ultimate result of the decision to green-belt a city as one to prevent housing demand within the zone to be met with supply,<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> thus exacerbating high housing prices and stifling competitive forces in general. <!-- This paragraph could be a lot clearer and shorter without so much marxist baggage --><!--I completely agree. I have just kept that in for balance with the positives highlighted in the more informative article on peri-urban agriculture, with a mention of farming and gardening which was completely left out somehow-->\n\n===Increasing urban sprawl===\nAnother area of criticism comes from the fact that, since a greenbelt does not extend indefinitely outside a city, it spurs the growth of areas much further away from the city core than if it had not existed, thereby actually ''increasing'' [[urban sprawl]].<ref>How Much Open Space is Enough?\" St. Paul Pioneer Press (MN) \u2013 April 22, 2007 \u2013 A1 MAIN</ref> Examples commonly cited are the [[Ottawa]] suburbs of [[Kanata, Ontario|Kanata]] and [[Orl\u00e9ans, Ontario|Orleans]], both of which are outside the city's greenbelt, and are currently undergoing explosive growth (see [[Greenbelt (Ottawa)]]). This leads to other problems, as residents of these areas have a longer commute to work places in the city and worse access to [[public transport]]. It also means people have to commute through the green belt, an area not designed to cope with high levels of transportation. Not only is the merit of a green belt subverted, but the green belt may heighten the problem and make the city unsustainable.\n\nThere are many examples whereby the actual effect of green belts is to act as a land reserve for future freeways and other highways. Examples include sections of the 407 highway north of Toronto and the Hunt Club Rd./Richmond Rd. south of Ottawa. Whether they are originally planned as such, or the result of a newer administration taking advantage of land that was left available by its predecessors is debatable.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n{{main|Green belt (United Kingdom)}}\nGreen belts were established in England from 1955 to simply prevent the physical growth of large built-up areas; to prevent neighboring cities and towns from merging.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the City|last=Caves|first=R. W.|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=318}}</ref>  In the UK, greenbelt around the major conurbations has been criticized as one of the main protectionist bars to building housing, the others being other planning restrictions (Local Plans and [[restrictive covenant]]s) and developers' [[land banking]]. Local Plans and land banking are to be relaxed for home building in the 2015-2030 period by law and the green belt will be reduced by some local authorities as each local authority must now consider it among the available shortlisted options in drawing development plans to meet higher housing targets. Critics argue that the greenbelts defeat their stated objective of saving the countryside and open spaces. Such criticism falls short when considering the other, broader benefits such as [[peri-urban agriculture]] which includes gardening and carries many benefits, especially to the retired. It also ignores the strategic aims of the [[Attlee Ministry]] in 1946, just as in France, of shifting capital away from the capital city (addressing regional disparity) and avoiding intra-urban gridlock.  The restrictions of the Green Belt were particularly in the 1940s-1980s mitigated with planned, government-supported, new towns under the [[New Towns Act 1946]] and [[New Towns Act 1981]]. These saw establishment beyond the greenbelts of new homes, [[infrastructure]], businesses and other facilities.  Without large scale sustainable development, [[infill development]] sees urban green space lost. A chronic housing shortage with inadequate new settlements and/or extension of those outside of the green belt and/or no green belt reduction has seen many brownfield sites, often well-suited to industry and commerce, lost in existing conurbations.<ref>''Political Barriers To Housebuilding In Britain: A Critical Case Study Of Protectionism & Its Industrial-Commercial Effects'', Industrial Systems Research/ Google Books, revised electronic edition 2013.

The son of a New York stockbroker, he initially worked in his father's firm but was more interested in theater. He landed jobs as an extra in [[short films]] produced by [[Paramount Pictures]] in its Long Island studio, and also performed with several stock theater companies, culminating with playing the male lead in ''[[Sweet Adeline (musical)|Sweet Adeline]]'' on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. This performance attracted the attention of film studio executives, and in 1931, [[Fox Film]] signed him to a Hollywood contract. \n\nHis screen debut in the 1931 film ''[[Bad Girl (1931 film)|Bad Girl]]'' made him an overnight box-office star and he was cast as the lead in a succession of romantic drama and comedy films. In 1934, he co-starred with [[Shirley Temple]] in her first three films. In 1935, at the height of his popularity, he broke his studio contract two years before it expired and became a free agent. With musicals on the wane in the late 1930s, he was cast in a series of [[B movie]]s and began struggling with alcoholism in his personal life. In 1945, having not worked in film for five years, he was selected by director [[Elia Kazan]] for the role of Johnny Nolan, the dreamy alcoholic father in ''[[A Tree Grows in Brooklyn (1945 film)|A Tree Grows in Brooklyn]]'' (1945), which earned him the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]]. \n\nThe Oscar did not advance his film career, however, and while he still found roles in Broadway productions, in 1949 he became a [[character actor]] on television. He had a regular role in the hit sitcom ''[[It's a Great Life (TV series)|It's a Great Life]]''  from 1954 to 1956, and guest-starred in dozens of episodes of popular television series from the 1950s through mid-1960s.

The son of a New York stockbroker, he initially worked in his father's firm but was more interested in theater. He landed jobs as an extra in [[short films]] produced by [[Paramount Pictures]] in its Long Island studio, and also performed with several stock theater companies, culminating with playing the male lead in ''[[Sweet Adeline (musical)|Sweet Adeline]]'' on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. This performance attracted the attention of film studio executives, and in 1931, [[Fox Film]] signed him to a Hollywood contract. \n\nHis screen debut in the 1931 film ''[[Bad Girl (1931 film)|Bad Girl]]'' made him an overnight box-office star and he was cast as the lead in a succession of romantic drama and comedy films. In 1934, he co-starred with [[Shirley Temple]] in her first three films. In 1935, at the height of his popularity, he broke his studio contract two years before it expired and became a free agent. With musicals on the wane in the late 1930s, he was cast in a series of [[B movie]]s and began struggling with alcoholism in his personal life. In 1945, having not worked in film for five years, he was selected by director [[Elia Kazan]] for the role of Johnny Nolan, the dreamy alcoholic father in ''[[A Tree Grows in Brooklyn (1945 film)|A Tree Grows in Brooklyn]]'' (1945), which earned him the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]]. \n\nThe Oscar did not advance his film career, however, and while he still found roles in Broadway productions, in 1949 he became a [[character actor]] on television. He had a regular role in the hit sitcom ''[[It's a Great Life (TV series)|It's a Great Life]]''  from 1954 to 1956, and guest-starred in dozens of episodes of popular television series from the 1950s through mid-1960s.
