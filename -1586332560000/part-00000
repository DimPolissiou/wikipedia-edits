He was famous for his wide-brimmed maroon hat which he wore in preference to a helmet against even the fastest bowlers. Richardson captained the West Indies in 24 Tests between 1991 when he took over from [[Viv Richards]] and 1995, winning 11, losing 6, and the rest ending in draws.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2mRjVQ9C9YwC&pg=PA96&lpg=PA96&dq=%22Richie+Richardson%22&source=bl&ots=g_RKZHHM8K&sig=tpxfkGn5NsH3E1XlpfXu0OjzEd0&hl=en&sa=X&ei=yaQnUODqCejJ0QWUroHwDw&ved=0CDoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Richardson&f=false |title=The Development of West Indies Cricket, Vol. 2: The Age of Nationalism |author=[[Hilary Beckles]] |year=1998 |page=201}}</ref>\n\n==Early days==\nRichardson was born in [[Five Islands, Antigua and Barbuda | Five Islands Village]], [[Antigua]]. He began his career with the [[Leeward Islands cricket team|Leewards Islands]] in 1982 as an opener. \n\n==International career==\nAfter his second season he was called up by the West Indies to tour India in the 1983\u201384 season. Richardson joined a successful West Indies Test team captained by [[Clive Lloyd]] batting in the middle order. His first tour started inauspiciously when Richardson lost his luggage and was left with few clothes. Veteran fast bowler [[Andy Roberts (cricketer)|Andy Roberts]] felt that Richardson was not getting enough practice as in the nets even bowlers were given a chance to bat ahead of him and by the time Richardson had an opportunity the main bowlers had finished. Roberts went out of his way to bowl at Richardson during the tour to make sure he had some preparation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/576267.html|title='If I write a book, a lot of people will get hurt'| publisher= ESPN Cricinfo| date=9 August 2012| accessdate= 11 August 2012}}</ref> \n\nOn 24 November 1983, Richardson debuted in the fourth match of the six-Test series, at which point the West Indies had a 2\u20130 lead, replacing [[Gus Logie]] who had bagged a pair in the previous Test. In his first innings Richardson too failed to score a run when was the victim of a poor umpiring decision. He was given out [[leg before wicket]] off the bowling oof off-spinner [[Shivlal Yadav]] though he had hit the ball. He was more successful in the second innings, making 26 before he was bowled, and the match ended in a draw.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/77221.html|title=Richie Richardson: My First Test | publisher= ESPN Cricinfo| date=9 October 1988| accessdate= 11 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n===1985 World Championship of Cricket=== \nAustralia hosted the [[World Championship of Cricket]] in February and March 1985 to commemorate the founding of Victoria. During the group stages the West Indies faced [[Sri Lankan national cricket team|Sri Lanka]] at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] on a pitch with uneven bounce. Though the West Indies won the match, a delivery from [[Ashantha de Mel]] reared and hit Richardson in the face; with [[Larry Gomes]], he was one of two West Indian batsmen to retire hurt during the game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/266958.html|title=The coach who caught Sachin, and a much-travelled man| author=Steven Lynch| publisher= ESPN Cricinfo| date=5 November 2006| accessdate= 12 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Captaincy===\nLate in 1991, West Indies captain [[Viv Richards]] informed the [[West Indies Cricket Board]] of his intention to relinquish the Test captaincy and retire after the [[1992 Cricket World Cup|1992 World Cup]].

[[cricket]]er and a former [[captain (cricket)|captain]] of the West Indian cricket team.\n\nHe was a flamboyant batsman and superb player of [[fast bowling]]. He was famous for his wide-brimmed maroon hat which he wore in preference to a helmet against even the fastest bowlers. Richardson captained the West Indies in 24 Tests between 1991 when he took over from [[Viv Richards]] and 1995, winning 11, losing 6, and the rest ending in draws.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2mRjVQ9C9YwC&pg=PA96&lpg=PA96&dq=%22Richie+Richardson%22&source=bl&ots=g_RKZHHM8K&sig=tpxfkGn5NsH3E1XlpfXu0OjzEd0&hl=en&sa=X&ei=yaQnUODqCejJ0QWUroHwDw&ved=0CDoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Richardson&f=false |title=The Development of West Indies Cricket, Vol. 2: The Age of Nationalism |author=[[Hilary Beckles]] |year=1998 |page=201}}</ref>\n\n==Early days==\nRichardson was born in [[Five Islands, Antigua and Barbuda | Five Islands Village]], [[Antigua]]. He began his career with the [[Leeward Islands cricket team|Leewards Islands]] in 1982 as an opener. \n\n==International career==\nAfter his second season he was called up by the West Indies to tour India in the 1983\u201384 season. Richardson joined a successful West Indies Test team captained by [[Clive Lloyd]] batting in the middle order. His first tour started inauspiciously when Richardson lost his luggage and was left with few clothes. Veteran fast bowler [[Andy Roberts (cricketer)|Andy Roberts]] felt that Richardson was not getting enough practice as in the nets even bowlers were given a chance to bat ahead of him and by the time Richardson had an opportunity the main bowlers had finished. Roberts went out of his way to bowl at Richardson during the tour to make sure he had some preparation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/576267.html|title='If I write a book, a lot of people will get hurt'| publisher= ESPN Cricinfo| date=9 August 2012| accessdate= 11 August 2012}}</ref> \n\nOn 24 November 1983, Richardson debuted in the fourth match of the six-Test series, at which point the West Indies had a 2\u20130 lead, replacing [[Gus Logie]] who had bagged a pair in the previous Test. In his first innings Richardson too failed to score a run when was the victim of a poor umpiring decision. He was given out [[leg before wicket]] off the bowling oof off-spinner [[Shivlal Yadav]] though he had hit the ball. He was more successful in the second innings, making 26 before he was bowled, and the match ended in a draw.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/77221.html|title=Richie Richardson: My First Test | publisher= ESPN Cricinfo| date=9 October 1988| accessdate= 11 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n===1985 World Championship of Cricket=== \nAustralia hosted the [[World Championship of Cricket]] in February and March 1985 to commemorate the founding of Victoria.

Its name is allegedly based on [[scorpion]]s that once lived there, now represented in its flag. Its Catholic parish seat has traditionally been [[Mysl\u00edv]]. Surnames of the village reaching back to the 17th century include Liska, Popule, Cihla, Ciz, and Ticha.\n\n== Genealogy and Immigration to America ==\nSo far, about 88 people born in Nehodiv have been identified as immigrating to America, sorted and profiled on [[FamilySearch]], a high ratio given a population averaging around 300. The earliest [[Immigration|immigrant]] from the village was probably Josefa Zelena (1835-1892) with her husband from Mysliv, Jan Rada, and children who settled in [[Baltimore]] in 1869. She was followed by Josef Kle\u010dka (1852-1926) who arrived in 1870. There he married Marie Hrani\u010dkov\u00e1 (1851-1913) from [[Kv\u00e1\u0161\u0148ovice]]. Josef returned multiple times to visit his mother and siblings, perhaps encouraging other villagers to follow him.\n\nOther early immigrants include V\u00e1clav Kon\u010dal (1843-1925) who brought his wife Marie V\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 (1844-1906) to [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]] around the same year.

Its name is allegedly based on [[scorpion]]s that once lived there, now represented in its flag. Its Catholic parish seat has traditionally been [[Mysl\u00edv]]. Surnames of the village reaching back to the 17th century include Liska, Popule, Cihla, Ciz, and Ticha.\n\n== Genealogy and Immigration to America ==\nSo far, about 88 people born in Nehodiv have been identified as immigrating to America, sorted and profiled on [[FamilySearch]], a high ratio given a population averaging around 300. The earliest [[Immigration|immigrant]] from the village was probably Josefa Zelena (1835-1892) with her husband from Mysliv, Jan Rada, and children who settled in [[Baltimore]] in 1869. She was followed by Josef Kle\u010dka (1852-1926) who arrived in 1870. There he married Marie Hrani\u010dkov\u00e1 (1851-1913) from [[Kv\u00e1\u0161\u0148ovice]]. Josef returned multiple times to visit his mother and siblings, perhaps encouraging other villagers to follow him.\n\nOther early immigrants include V\u00e1clav Kon\u010dal (1843-1925) who brought his wife Marie V\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 (1844-1906) to [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]] around the same year. Never having biological children, the couple adopted V\u00e1clav's brother son V\u00e1clav and Marie's sister's daughter Josefa.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:M93F-QVF|title=United States Census, 1900|last=Konchal|first=|date=|website=FamilySearch|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nA significant number of the immigrants share a [[Genetic testing|DNA]] and blood relation via children of the couple Krystof Sramek (1700-1767) and Katerina Hithova (1705-1760) from Klikarov, Vojovice, and [[Lou\u017en\u00e1|Louzna]] in the 18th century.\n\n* Katerina Sramkova (1727-1798) is the ancestor of the Kotesovec's and the Popule's.\n*Dorota Sramkova (1730-1796) is the ancestor of the Protova's, Blazek's, and Vojtech Zeleny (specifically).\n*Ondrej Sramek (1743-) is the great grandfather of the Poustkova sisters.

The film brought Almod\u00f3var to widespread international attention: it was nominated for the [[61st Academy Awards|1988]] [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]],<ref name=\"Oscars1989\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1989 |title=The 61st Academy Awards (1989) Nominees and Winners |accessdate=20 August 2015 |work=oscars.org}}</ref> and won five [[Goya Awards]] including Best Film and Best Actress in a Leading Role for Maura. It was released on 11 November 1988. \n\nThe actual Spanish title refers to an ''{{lang|es|ataque de nervios}}'', which is not actually well translated as \"[[nervous breakdown]]\" (''{{lang|es|crisis nerviosa}}''). ''{{lang|es|Ataques de nervios}}'' are culture-bound psychological phenomena during which the individual, most often female, displays dramatic outpouring of negative emotions, bodily gestures, occasional falling to the ground, and fainting, often in response to receiving disturbing news or witnessing or participating in an upsetting event. Historically, this condition has been associated with [[hysteria]] and more recently in the scientific literature with [[post-traumatic stress]] and [[panic attack]]s.<ref>Schechter DS, Marshall RD, Salman E, Goetz D, Davies SO, Liebowitz MR (2000).

In the film, TV actress Pepa Marcos is depressed and taking [[sleeping pill]]s because her boyfriend Iv\u00e1n has just left her. Both she and Iv\u00e1n work as [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|voice-over actors who dub]] foreign films, notably ''[[Johnny Guitar]]'' with [[Joan Crawford]] and [[Sterling Hayden]]. The voice he uses to sweet-talk her (and many other women) is the same one he uses in his work. He is about to leave on a trip and has asked Pepa to pack his things in a suitcase that he will pick up later.\n\nPepa returns home later to find her answering machine filled with frantic messages from her friend, Candela. In anger, she rips out the phone and throws it through the window onto the balcony. Candela arrives, still overwhelmed, but before she can explain her situation, Carlos, Iv\u00e1n's son with previous lover Luc\u00eda, arrives with his snobbish fianc\u00e9e, Marisa. It turns out they are apartment-hunting, and by coincidence have chosen Pepa's penthouse to look at. Carlos and Pepa figure out each other's relationship to Iv\u00e1n; Pepa wants to know where Iv\u00e1n is because she has to tell him something, but Carlos doesn't know where his father is. Candela unsuccessfully attempts to kill herself by jumping off the balcony.\n\nMeanwhile, Marisa has become bored and decides to drink some [[gazpacho]] she finds in the fridge, not realizing that it has been spiked with sleeping pills. Candela finally gets to explain her situation: a while ago she had a love affair with an Arab who later came to visit her, bringing some friends with him. It turns out that they are a Shiite terrorist cell and Candela was unknowingly harboring them in her home. When the terrorists left, Candela fled to Pepa's place for help. Candela fears that the police think she is involved and will come for her. Pepa sets out to see a lawyer Carlos has recommended to help Candela, and ends up catching the same cab with the same Mambo-loving driver.\n\nHowever, Paulina, the lawyer she visits, is acting strangely. Pepa sees that Paulina has tickets to Stockholm. Iv\u00e1n calls the office at one point, and Paulina seems to know Pepa, and is very rude to her. Meanwhile, Candela reveals to Carlos that the Shiites plan to hijack a flight to [[Stockholm]] that evening and divert it to [[Beirut]], where the Shiite terrorists have a friend who was captured by the authorities. After Carlos fixes the broken phone, he quickly calls the police, but hangs up before (he believes) they can trace the call, then surprisingly kisses Candela. Pepa returns and Luc\u00eda calls, announcing she is coming over to confront her about Iv\u00e1n. Carlos reveals that Luc\u00eda has been in a mental hospital since Iv\u00e1n left her and has only now been released. Pepa, now sick of Iv\u00e1n and no longer wanting to see him, heads back down with Iv\u00e1n's suitcase; she throws it out, just barely missing Iv\u00e1n, who has arrived with Paulina on their way to the airport. He leaves Pepa a message.\n\nPepa returns to her apartment and hears the song from the opening, \"Soy Infeliz\", which Carlos is playing. Enraged, Pepa yanks off the [[Gramophone record|record]] and throws it out of the window, and it ends up hitting Paulina. Pepa then hears Iv\u00e1n's message and once again rips out the phone and throws the answering machine back out of the window; it lands on Paulina's car. Back in the apartment, Luc\u00eda arrives, along with the phone repairman and the police, who have traced Carlos' earlier call. Candela starts to panic, but Carlos comes up with an idea: to serve everyone the spiked gazpacho. The policemen and repairman are knocked out, Carlos and Candela make out on the sofa and also fall asleep, and Luc\u00eda grabs the policemen's guns and aims them at Pepa, who figures out that Paulina is the other woman Iv\u00e1n is going to Stockholm with, and that their flight is the one that the terrorists are planning to hijack. Luc\u00eda reveals that she is still insane and only faked sanity when she heard Iv\u00e1n's voice dubbed on a foreign film. She throws the gazpacho into Pepa's face and rushes to the airport to kill Iv\u00e1n; she sees a motorcyclist and forces him to act as her driver.\n\nPepa chases her and is joined by her neighbour Ana, who happens to be the motorcyclist's stood-up girlfriend. They quickly hail a cab (driven by the Mambo taxi driver again) and a mad chase ensues to the airport, with Luc\u00eda firing the gun at them. Luc\u00eda arrives at the airport, sees that Iv\u00e1n and Paulina are about to pass security, and aims her gun at them. Pepa arrives just in time and thwarts the murder attempt by rolling a luggage cart at Luc\u00eda. Iv\u00e1n runs over to Pepa, who is now mentally and physically exhausted after two days of trying to chase down her lover. Iv\u00e1n offers to finally speak with her about whatever she has been trying to speak to him about, and for a moment, it seems he might even leave Paulina to take her back. But Pepa refuses, saying, \"There was still time last night, this morning, even today at noon. But now it's too late\". Having saved his life, she leaves the airport, and Iv\u00e1n, for good.\n\nPepa returns to her home, which is a mess with a burnt bedroom, broken windows, a telephone ripped from the wall, spilled gazpacho on the floor, her menagerie of chickens and geese running around loose, and several unconscious visitors all overdosed on sleeping pills. Pepa sits on her balcony where Marisa has just woken up. The two women chat, sharing a moment of tranquility at the end of a hectic 48 hours, and Pepa finally reveals what her big news for Iv\u00e1n was: she's pregnant.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Carmen Maura]] as Pepa Marcos\n* [[Antonio Banderas]] as Carlos\n* [[Julieta Serrano]] as Luc\u00eda\n* [[Rossy de Palma]] as Marisa\n* [[Mar\u00eda Barranco]] as Candela\n* [[Fernando Guill\u00e9n (actor)|Fernando Guill\u00e9n]] as Iv\u00e1n\n* [[Kiti M\u00e1nver]] as Paulina Morales\n* Guillermo Montesinos as taxi driver\n* [[Chus Lampreave]] as Portera [[Jehovah's Witnesses|Testiga de Jehov\u00e1]]\n* [[Loles Le\u00f3n]] as Secretaria\n}}\n\n==Reception==\nReview aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 89% out of 27 professional critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 7.7/10.<ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/women_on_the_verge_of_a_nervous_breakdown/ Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown].

The film brought Almod\u00f3var to widespread international attention: it was nominated for the [[61st Academy Awards|1988]] [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]],<ref name=\"Oscars1989\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1989 |title=The 61st Academy Awards (1989) Nominees and Winners |accessdate=20 August 2015 |work=oscars.org}}</ref> and won five [[Goya Awards]] including Best Film and Best Actress in a Leading Role for Maura. It was released on 11 November 1988. \n\nThe actual Spanish title refers to an ''{{lang|es|ataque de nervios}}'', which is not actually well translated as \"[[nervous breakdown]]\" (''{{lang|es|crisis nerviosa}}''). ''{{lang|es|Ataques de nervios}}'' are culture-bound psychological phenomena during which the individual, most often female, displays dramatic outpouring of negative emotions, bodily gestures, occasional falling to the ground, and fainting, often in response to receiving disturbing news or witnessing or participating in an upsetting event. Historically, this condition has been associated with [[hysteria]] and more recently in the scientific literature with [[post-traumatic stress]] and [[panic attack]]s.<ref>Schechter DS, Marshall RD, Salman E, Goetz D, Davies SO, Liebowitz MR (2000).

In the film, TV actress Pepa Marcos ([[Carmen Maura]]) is depressed and taking [[sleeping pill]]s because her boyfriend Iv\u00e1n ([[Fernando Guill\u00e9n (actor)|Fernando Guill\u00e9n]]) has just left her. Both she and Iv\u00e1n work as [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|voice-over actors who dub]] foreign films, notably ''[[Johnny Guitar]]'' with [[Joan Crawford]] and [[Sterling Hayden]]. The voice he uses to sweet-talk her (and many other women) is the same one he uses in his work. He is about to leave on a trip and has asked Pepa to pack his things in a suitcase that he will pick up later.\n\nPepa returns home later to find her answering machine filled with frantic messages from her friend, Candela ([[Mar\u00eda Barranco]]). In anger, she rips out the phone and throws it through the window onto the balcony. Candela arrives, still overwhelmed, but before she can explain her situation, Carlos ([[Antonio Banderas]]), Iv\u00e1n's son with previous lover Luc\u00eda ([[Julieta Serrano]]), arrives with his snobbish fianc\u00e9e, Marisa ([[Rossy de Palma]]). It turns out they are apartment-hunting, and by coincidence have chosen Pepa's penthouse to look at. Carlos and Pepa figure out each other's relationship to Iv\u00e1n; Pepa wants to know where Iv\u00e1n is because she has to tell him something, but Carlos doesn't know where his father is. Candela unsuccessfully attempts to kill herself by jumping off the balcony.\n\nMeanwhile, Marisa has become bored and decides to drink some [[gazpacho]] she finds in the fridge, not realizing that it has been spiked with sleeping pills. Candela finally gets to explain her situation: a while ago she had a love affair with an Arab who later came to visit her, bringing some friends with him. It turns out that they are a Shiite terrorist cell and Candela was unknowingly harboring them in her home. When the terrorists left, Candela fled to Pepa's place for help. Candela fears that the police think she is involved and will come for her. Pepa sets out to see a lawyer Carlos has recommended to help Candela, and ends up catching the same cab with the same Mambo-loving driver.\n\nHowever, Paulina, the lawyer she visits, is acting strangely. Pepa sees that Paulina has tickets to Stockholm. Iv\u00e1n calls the office at one point, and Paulina seems to know Pepa, and is very rude to her. Meanwhile, Candela reveals to Carlos that the Shiites plan to hijack a flight to [[Stockholm]] that evening and divert it to [[Beirut]], where the Shiite terrorists have a friend who was captured by the authorities. After Carlos fixes the broken phone, he quickly calls the police, but hangs up before (he believes) they can trace the call, then surprisingly kisses Candela. Pepa returns and Luc\u00eda calls, announcing she is coming over to confront her about Iv\u00e1n. Carlos reveals that Luc\u00eda has been in a mental hospital since Iv\u00e1n left her and has only now been released. Pepa, now sick of Iv\u00e1n and no longer wanting to see him, heads back down with Iv\u00e1n's suitcase; she throws it out, just barely missing Iv\u00e1n, who has arrived with Paulina ([[Kiti M\u00e1nver]]) on their way to the airport. He leaves Pepa a message.\n\nPepa returns to her apartment and hears the song from the opening, \"Soy Infeliz\", which Carlos is playing. Enraged, Pepa yanks off the [[Gramophone record|record]] and throws it out of the window, and it ends up hitting Paulina. Pepa then hears Iv\u00e1n's message and once again rips out the phone and throws the answering machine back out of the window; it lands on Paulina's car. Back in the apartment, Luc\u00eda arrives, along with the phone repairman and the police, who have traced Carlos' earlier call. Candela starts to panic, but Carlos comes up with an idea: to serve everyone the spiked gazpacho. The policemen and repairman are knocked out, Carlos and Candela make out on the sofa and also fall asleep, and Luc\u00eda grabs the policemen's guns and aims them at Pepa, who figures out that Paulina is the other woman Iv\u00e1n is going to Stockholm with, and that their flight is the one that the terrorists are planning to hijack. Luc\u00eda reveals that she is still insane and only faked sanity when she heard Iv\u00e1n's voice dubbed on a foreign film. She throws the gazpacho into Pepa's face and rushes to the airport to kill Iv\u00e1n; she sees a motorcyclist and forces him to act as her driver.\n\nPepa chases her and is joined by her neighbour Ana, who happens to be the motorcyclist's stood-up girlfriend. They quickly hail a cab (driven by the Mambo taxi driver again) and a mad chase ensues to the airport, with Luc\u00eda firing the gun at them. Luc\u00eda arrives at the airport, sees that Iv\u00e1n and Paulina are about to pass security, and aims her gun at them. Pepa arrives just in time and thwarts the murder attempt by rolling a luggage cart at Luc\u00eda. Iv\u00e1n runs over to Pepa, who is now mentally and physically exhausted after two days of trying to chase down her lover. Iv\u00e1n offers to finally speak with her about whatever she has been trying to speak to him about, and for a moment, it seems he might even leave Paulina to take her back. But Pepa refuses, saying, \"There was still time last night, this morning, even today at noon. But now it's too late\". Having saved his life, she leaves the airport, and Iv\u00e1n, for good.\n\nPepa returns to her home, which is a mess with a burnt bedroom, broken windows, a telephone ripped from the wall, spilled gazpacho on the floor, her menagerie of chickens and geese running around loose, and several unconscious visitors all overdosed on sleeping pills. Pepa sits on her balcony where Marisa has just woken up. The two women chat, sharing a moment of tranquility at the end of a hectic 48 hours, and Pepa finally reveals what her big news for Iv\u00e1n was: she's pregnant.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Carmen Maura]] as Pepa Marcos\n* [[Antonio Banderas]] as Carlos\n* [[Julieta Serrano]] as Luc\u00eda\n* [[Rossy de Palma]] as Marisa\n* [[Mar\u00eda Barranco]] as Candela\n* [[Fernando Guill\u00e9n (actor)|Fernando Guill\u00e9n]] as Iv\u00e1n\n* [[Kiti M\u00e1nver]] as Paulina Morales\n* Guillermo Montesinos as taxi driver\n* [[Chus Lampreave]] as Portera [[Jehovah's Witnesses|Testiga de Jehov\u00e1]]\n* [[Loles Le\u00f3n]] as Secretaria\n}}\n\n==Reception==\nReview aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 89% out of 27 professional critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 7.7/10.<ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/women_on_the_verge_of_a_nervous_breakdown/ Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown].

There was a demonstration of the car by W Motors in 2013 in Dubai, in which they claim to have recorded the car's performance.\n\n==Movie Version==\nA Lykan HyperSport was featured in the [[Furious 7]] movie.
