According to the 2016 Census, 53,504 people live in the city, with a wider metropolitan population of 82,963.\n\nToday, Waterford is known for [[Waterford Crystal]], a legacy of the city's former glass making industry. Glass, or crystal, was manufactured in the city from 1783 until early 2009, when the factory there was shut down after the receivership of Waterford Wedgwood plc. The Waterford Crystal visitor centre in the Viking Quarter, under new owners, opened in June 2010, after the intervention of Waterford City Council and Waterford Chamber of Commerce, and resumed production.

The Irish name is ''Port L\u00e1irge'', meaning \"L\u00e1rag's port\".<ref name=McEneaney>''Discover Waterford'', by Eamon McEneaney (2001). ({{ISBN|0-86278-656-8}})</ref>\n\n[[Viking]] raiders first established a settlement near Waterford in 853. It and all the other [[longphort]]s were vacated in 902, the Vikings having been driven out by the native Irish. The Vikings re-established themselves in Ireland at Waterford in 914, led at first by [[Ottir Iarla]] (Jarl Ottar) until 917, and after that by [[Ragnall ua \u00cdmair]] and the [[U\u00ed \u00cdmair]] dynasty, and built what would be Ireland's first city. Among the most prominent [[rulers of Waterford]] was [[Ivar of Waterford]].\n\nIn 1167, [[Diarmait Mac Murchada]], the deposed [[Kings of Leinster|King of Leinster]], failed in an attempt to take Waterford. He returned in 1170 with [[Cambro-Norman]] mercenaries under [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke]] (known as Strongbow); together they besieged and took the city after a desperate defence. In furtherance of the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]], King [[Henry II of England]] landed at Waterford in 1171. Waterford and then [[Dublin]] were declared royal cities, with Dublin also declared capital of Ireland.\n\nThroughout the medieval period, Waterford was Ireland's second city after Dublin. In the 15th century Waterford repelled two pretenders to the English throne: [[Lambert Simnel]] and [[Perkin Warbeck]]. As a result, King [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] gave the city its motto: ''Urbs Intacta Manet Waterfordia (Waterford remains the untaken city)''.\n\nAfter the Protestant Reformation, Waterford remained a [[Catholic]] city and participated in the [[Confederate Ireland|confederation of Kilkenny]] \u2013 an independent Catholic government from 1642 to 1649. This was ended abruptly by [[Oliver Cromwell]], who [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland|brought the country back under English rule]]; his son-in-law [[Henry Ireton]] finally took Waterford in 1650 after a [[Siege of Waterford|major siege]].<ref name=\"NewHistory\" /> \nIn 1690, during the [[Williamite War]], the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] [[Irish Army (Kingdom of Ireland)|Irish Army]] was [[Capture of Waterford|forced to surrender Waterford]] in the wake of the [[Battle of the Boyne]].\n\nThe 18th century was a period of huge prosperity for Waterford. Most of the city's best architecture appeared during this time. A permanent military presence was established in the city with the completion of the [[Waterford Barracks|Cavalry Barracks]] at the end of the 18th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://waterfordvikingtriangle.com/assets/A3-Heritage-walk-map.pdf|title=Heritage Walk map|accessdate=7 December 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208180034/http://waterfordvikingtriangle.com/assets/A3-Heritage-walk-map.pdf|archivedate=8 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 19th century, Waterford City was deemed vulnerable and the British government erected three [[Martello tower]]s on the Hook Peninsula to reinforce the existing Fort at [[Duncannon]]. During the 19th century, great industries such as glass making and ship building thrived in the city.\n\nThe city was represented in the [[Palace of Westminster|Parliament]] of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] from 1891 to 1918 by [[John Redmond]] [[Member of Parliament (UK)|MP]], leader (from January 1900) of the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]]. Redmond, then leader of the [[Charles Stuart Parnell|pro-Parnell]] faction of the party, defeated [[David Sheehy]] in 1891. In 1911, Br. Jerome Foley, Br. Dunstan Drumm and Br. Leopold Loughran left Waterford for [[Malvern, Victoria|Malvern, Australia]]. Here, they founded [[De La Salle College Malvern|a Catholic college]] which is still in existence today.<ref>Steve Stefanopolous, ''St. Joseph's Malvern'', 2003. Held by the De La Salle College Malvern Archives</ref> In July 1922, Waterford was the scene of fighting between [[Irish Free State]] and [[Irish Republican]] troops during the [[Irish Civil War]].\n\n===References in Annals of Inisfallen===\nSee [[Annals of Inisfallen]] (AI)\n* ''AI926.2 The fleet of Port L\u00e1irge [came] over land, and they settled on [[Lough Gur|Loch Gair]].''\n* ''AI927.2 A slaughter of the foreigners of Port L\u00e1irge [was inflicted] at Cell Mo-Chell\u00f3c by the men of [[Munster|Mumu]] and by the foreigners of [[Limerick|Luimnech]].''\n* ''AI984.2 A great naval expedition(?) by the sons of [[Ivar of Limerick|Aralt]] to Port L\u00e1irge, and they and the [[Brian Boru|son of Cenn\u00e9tig]] exchanged hostages there as a guarantee of both together providing a hosting to attack [[Dublin|\u00c1th Cliath]].

The authority came into operation on 1 June 2014. Prior to this the city had its own local council, [[Waterford City Council]]. The new Council is the result of a merger of Waterford City Council and [[Waterford County Council]]. The Council has 32 representatives (councillors) who are elected from five electoral areas. The city itself forms three of the electoral areas \u2013 which when combined form the Metropolitan District of Waterford \u2013 and returns a total of 18 councillors to Waterford City and County Council. Residents in these areas are restricted to voting for candidates located in their ward for [[local elections]]. The office of the [[List of rulers of Waterford|Mayor of Waterford]] was established in 1377. A mayor is then elected by the councillors from the two electoral areas of the Metropolitan District of Waterford every year, and there is no limit to the number of terms an individual may serve. Mary O'Halloran who was mayor during 2007\u20132008 was the first woman to hold the post. The current mayor is Adam Wyse.\n\nFor the purposes of [[Elections in the Republic of Ireland|elections]] to [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]], the city is part of the [[Waterford (D\u00e1il constituency)|Waterford constituency]], which includes the county of Waterford except for those parts of the county near [[Clonmel]] that lie in [[Tipperary South (D\u00e1il constituency)|Tipperary South]].<ref name=\"ea-2009\">{{cite web |title=Electoral (Amendment) Act 2009: Schedule |url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2009/en/act/pub/0004/sched.html |work=[[Irish Statute Book|Irish Statute Book database]] |accessdate=29 September 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125044921/http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2009/en/act/pub/0004/sched.html |archivedate=25 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The constituency elects four deputies to D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann.

To this day, it remains Waterford's most recognisable landmark. It is believed to be the first building in Ireland to use mortar. The [[River Suir]], which flows through Waterford City, has provided a basis for the city's long maritime history. The place downriver from Waterford where the [[River Nore|Nore]] and the [[River Barrow|Barrow]] join the [[River Suir]] is known in Irish as ''Cumar na dTr\u00ed Uisce'' (\"The confluence of the three waters\"). Waterford Port has been one of Ireland's major ports for over a millennium. In the 19th century, shipbuilding was a major industry. The owners of the Neptune Shipyard, the [[Malcomson family]], built and operated the largest fleet of iron steamers in the world between the mid-1850s and the late 1860s, including five trans-Atlantic passenger liners.<ref name=McEneaney />\n\nToday, Waterford is known for [[Waterford Crystal]], a legacy of the city's former glass making industry.

This is the part of the city surrounded by the original 10th century fortifications, which is triangular in shape with its apex at Reginald's Tower. Though this was once the site of a thriving Viking city, the city centre has shifted to the west over the years, and it is now a quiet and tranquil area, dominated by narrow streets, medieval architecture, and civic spaces. Over the past decade, a number of restaurants have opened in High Street and Henrietta Street, taking advantage of the charming character of the area. Much of Waterford's impressive architecture is to be found in the 'Viking Triangle'.\n\nIn the 15th century, the city was enlarged with the building of an outer wall on the west side. Today Waterford retains more of its city walls than any other city in Ireland with the exception of [[Derry]], whose walls were built much later. Tours of Waterford's city walls are conducted daily.\n\nThe Quay, once termed by historian [[Mark Girouard]] 'the noblest quay in Europe', is a mile long from Grattan Quay to Adelphi Quay, though Adelphi Quay is now a residential area. It is still a major focal point for Waterford, commercially and socially, and the face that Waterford presents to those travelling into the city from the north. Near Reginald's Tower is the [[William Vincent Wallace]] Plaza, a monument and amenity built around the time of the millennium that commemorates the Waterford born composer.\n\nJohn Roberts Square is a pedestrianised area that is one of the main focal points of Waterford's modern day commercial centre. It was named after the city's most celebrated architect, John Roberts, and was formed from the junction of Barronstrand Street, Broad Street and George's Street. It is often referred to locally as Red Square, due to the red paving that was used when the area was first pedestrianised. A short distance to the east of John Roberts Square is Arundel Square, another square with a fine commercial tradition, which the City Square shopping centre opens onto.\n\nBallybricken, in the west, just outside the city walls, is thought to have been Waterford's Irishtown, a type of settlement that often formed outside Irish cities to house the Vikings and Irish that had been expelled during the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]]. Ballybricken is an inner city neighbourhood with a long tradition, centred around Ballybricken hill, which was a large, open market-square. Today it has been converted into a green, civic space, but the Bull Post, where livestock was once bought and sold, still stands as a remnant of the hill's past.\n\n[[File:Waterfordcathedral.jpg|thumb|Cathedral of the Most Holy Trinity on Barronstrand Street]]\n\nThe Mall is a fine Georgian thoroughfare, built by the Wide Streets Commission to extend the city southwards. It contains some of the city's finest Georgian architecture. The [[People's Park (Waterford)|People's Park]], Waterford's largest and finest park, is located nearby.\n\nFerrybank, in [[County Waterford]], is Waterford's only suburb north of the river. It contains a village centre of its own.\n\nIn April 2003 an important site combining a 5th-century [[Iron Age]] and 9th century [[Viking]] settlement was discovered at [[Woodstown]] near the city, which appears to have been a Viking town that predates all such settlements in Ireland.<ref>[http://www.vikingwaterford.com/ 9th Century Settlement found at Woodstown] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218104315/http://vikingwaterford.com/ |date=18 December 2014 }} \u2013 vikingwaterford.com</ref>\n\n[[Waterford Crystal]] is manufactured in Waterford but in early 2009 the company moved it operations to continental Europe. A new Waterford Crystal visitor centre opened on 22 June 2010.\n\nWaterford's oldest public house (pub) can be found just outside the old 'Viking Triangle'. T & H Doolan's, of 31/32 George's Street, has been officially active and open to the public for over three hundred years. The official record of licences dates back to the 18th century but the premises is believed to be closer to five hundred years in age. A main element of the structure includes one of the original city walls, almost 1,000 years old, which can be viewed in the lounge area of the building.\n{{-}}\n\n==Economy==\nWaterford is the main city of Ireland's [[South-East Region, Ireland|South-East Region]]. Historically Waterford was an important trading port which brought much prosperity to the city throughout the city's eventful history. Throughout its history Waterford Crystal provided employment to thousands in the city and surrounding areas.\n\nWaterford Port is Ireland's closest deep-water port to mainland Europe, handling approximately 12% of Ireland's external trade by value.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.waterfordcity.ie/documents/reports/WCDB%20Strategy%202002-2012.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812205744/http://www.waterfordcity.ie/documents/reports/WCDB%20Strategy%202002-2012.pdf |archivedate=12 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Waterford's most famous export, [[Waterford Crystal]], is an internationally known and highly sought after product that was manufactured in the city from 1783 to 2009 and again from 2010 to the present day.

[[Kilmeadan]], about 5&nbsp;km from the city, was home to a very successful [[co-operative]]. The farmers of the area benefited from the sale of their produce (mostly [[butter]] and [[milk]]) to the co-op. In 1964, all of the co-ops in Waterford amalgamated to become Waterford Co-op. This led to the construction of a [[cheese]] factory on a greenfield site opposite the general store, and Kilmeadan cheese was to become one of the most recognised and successful [[Cheddar cheese|Cheddar]] brands in the world, winning gold and bronze medals in the World Cheese Awards in London in 2005.\n\nWaterford is the site of a number of multinational companies including [[GlaxoSmithKline]], Bausch & Lomb, Nypro Healthcare, [[Sanofi]], West Pharmaceuticals, Hasbro, Teva Pharmaceuticals and Honeywell International.\n\nThe Irish economic recession from 2008 onwards has had a major negative impact on Waterford's economy. A number of multinational companies have closed, including Waterford Crystal (which subsequently reopened) and Talk Talk, which has led to a high level of unemployment. Until 2013 the [[hedge fund]] office of the [[Citibank]] resided here.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/citi-bank-waterford-job-losses-910614-May2013|title=50 jobs lost as Citi Bank announce Waterford office closure|first=Christina|last=Finn|website=Thejournal.ie|accessdate=1 October 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171002022108/http://www.thejournal.ie/citi-bank-waterford-job-losses-910614-May2013/|archivedate=2 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nWaterford Co-op and Avonmore Co-op have merged to form Glanbia plc.<ref>{{Cite book|title=21st Century Business Revised Edition|last=Murphy|first=William|publisher=CJ Fallon|year=2014|isbn=978-0-7144-1923-7|location=Ground Floor \u2013 Block B, Liffey Valley Office Campus, Dublin 22|pages=437|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n==Transport==\n{{Main|Transport in Waterford}}\n\nThe [[M9 motorway (Ireland)|M9 motorway]], which was completed on 9 September 2010, connects the city to [[Dublin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishmotorwayinfo.com/inex/roads/m9/m9.html|title=M9 Motorway|author=Irish Motorway Info|work=irishmotorwayinfo.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721075015/http://www.irishmotorwayinfo.com/inex/roads/m9/m9.html|archivedate=21 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The [[N24 road (Ireland)|N24]] road connects the city to [[Limerick]] city.

The Irish name is ''Port L\u00e1irge'', meaning \"L\u00e1rag's port\".<ref name=McEneaney>''Discover Waterford'', by Eamon McEneaney (2001). ({{ISBN|0-86278-656-8}})</ref>\n\n[[Viking]] raiders first established a settlement near Waterford in 853. It and all the other [[longphort]]s were vacated in 902, the Vikings having been driven out by the native Irish. The Vikings re-established themselves in Ireland at Waterford in 914, led at first by [[Ottir Iarla]] (Jarl Ottar) until 917, and after that by [[Ragnall ua \u00cdmair]] and the [[U\u00ed \u00cdmair]] dynasty, and built what would be Ireland's first city. Among the most prominent [[rulers of Waterford]] was [[Ivar of Waterford]].\n\nIn 1167, [[Diarmait Mac Murchada]], the deposed [[Kings of Leinster|King of Leinster]], failed in an attempt to take Waterford. He returned in 1170 with [[Cambro-Norman]] mercenaries under [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke]] (known as Strongbow); together they besieged and took the city after a desperate defence. In furtherance of the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]], King [[Henry II of England]] landed at Waterford in 1171. Waterford and then [[Dublin]] were declared royal cities, with Dublin also declared capital of Ireland.\n\nThroughout the medieval period, Waterford was Ireland's second city after Dublin. In the 15th century Waterford repelled two pretenders to the English throne: [[Lambert Simnel]] and [[Perkin Warbeck]]. As a result, King [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] gave the city its motto: ''Urbs Intacta Manet Waterfordia (Waterford remains the untaken city)''.\n\nAfter the Protestant Reformation, Waterford remained a [[Catholic]] city and participated in the [[Confederate Ireland|confederation of Kilkenny]] \u2013 an independent Catholic government from 1642 to 1649. This was ended abruptly by [[Oliver Cromwell]], who [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland|brought the country back under English rule]]; his son-in-law [[Henry Ireton]] finally took Waterford in 1650 after a [[Siege of Waterford|major siege]].<ref name=\"NewHistory\" /> \nIn 1690, during the [[Williamite War]], the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] [[Irish Army (Kingdom of Ireland)|Irish Army]] was [[Capture of Waterford|forced to surrender Waterford]] in the wake of the [[Battle of the Boyne]].\n\nThe 18th century was a period of huge prosperity for Waterford. Most of the city's best architecture appeared during this time. A permanent military presence was established in the city with the completion of the [[Waterford Barracks|Cavalry Barracks]] at the end of the 18th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://waterfordvikingtriangle.com/assets/A3-Heritage-walk-map.pdf|title=Heritage Walk map|accessdate=7 December 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208180034/http://waterfordvikingtriangle.com/assets/A3-Heritage-walk-map.pdf|archivedate=8 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 19th century, Waterford City was deemed vulnerable and the British government erected three [[Martello tower]]s on the Hook Peninsula to reinforce the existing Fort at [[Duncannon]]. During the 19th century, great industries such as glass making and ship building thrived in the city.\n\nThe city was represented in the [[Palace of Westminster|Parliament]] of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] from 1891 to 1918 by [[John Redmond]] [[Member of Parliament (UK)|MP]], leader (from January 1900) of the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]]. Redmond, then leader of the [[Charles Stuart Parnell|pro-Parnell]] faction of the party, defeated [[David Sheehy]] in 1891. In 1911, Br. Jerome Foley, Br. Dunstan Drumm and Br. Leopold Loughran left Waterford for [[Malvern, Victoria|Malvern, Australia]]. Here, they founded [[De La Salle College Malvern|a Catholic college]] which is still in existence today.<ref>Steve Stefanopolous, ''St. Joseph's Malvern'', 2003.

The authority came into operation on 1 June 2014. Prior to this the city had its own local council, [[Waterford City Council]]. The new Council is the result of a merger of Waterford City Council and [[Waterford County Council]]. The Council has 32 representatives (councillors) who are elected from five electoral areas. The city itself forms three of the electoral areas \u2013 which when combined form the Metropolitan District of Waterford \u2013 and returns a total of 18 councillors to Waterford City and County Council. Residents in these areas are restricted to voting for candidates located in their ward for [[local elections]]. The office of the [[List of rulers of Waterford|Mayor of Waterford]] was established in 1377. A mayor is then elected by the councillors from the two electoral areas of the Metropolitan District of Waterford every year, and there is no limit to the number of terms an individual may serve. Mary O'Halloran who was mayor during 2007\u20132008 was the first woman to hold the post. The current mayor is Adam Wyse.\n\nFor the purposes of [[Elections in the Republic of Ireland|elections]] to [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]], the city is part of the [[Waterford (D\u00e1il constituency)|Waterford constituency]], which includes the county of Waterford except for those parts of the county near [[Clonmel]] that lie in [[Tipperary South (D\u00e1il constituency)|Tipperary South]].<ref name=\"ea-2009\">{{cite web |title=Electoral (Amendment) Act 2009: Schedule |url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2009/en/act/pub/0004/sched.html |work=[[Irish Statute Book|Irish Statute Book database]] |accessdate=29 September 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125044921/http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2009/en/act/pub/0004/sched.html |archivedate=25 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The constituency elects four deputies to D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann.

To this day, it remains Waterford's most recognisable landmark. It is believed to be the first building in Ireland to use mortar.

The place downriver from Waterford where the [[River Nore|Nore]] and the [[River Barrow|Barrow]] join the [[River Suir]] is known in Irish as ''Cumar na dTr\u00ed Uisce'' (\"The confluence of the three waters\"). Waterford Port has been one of Ireland's major ports for over a millennium. In the 19th century, shipbuilding was a major industry. The owners of the Neptune Shipyard, the [[Malcomson family]], built and operated the largest fleet of iron steamers in the world between the mid-1850s and the late 1860s, including five trans-Atlantic passenger liners.<ref name=McEneaney />\n\nToday, Waterford is known for [[Waterford Crystal]], a legacy of the city's former glass making industry.

This is the part of the city surrounded by the original 10th century fortifications, which is triangular in shape with its apex at Reginald's Tower. Though this was once the site of a thriving Viking city, the city centre has shifted to the west over the years, and it is now a quiet and tranquil area, dominated by narrow streets, medieval architecture, and civic spaces. Over the past decade, a number of restaurants have opened in High Street and Henrietta Street, taking advantage of the charming character of the area. Much of Waterford's impressive architecture is to be found in the 'Viking Triangle'.\n\nIn the 15th century, the city was enlarged with the building of an outer wall on the west side. Today Waterford retains more of its city walls than any other city in Ireland with the exception of [[Derry]], whose walls were built much later. Tours of Waterford's city walls are conducted daily.\n\nThe Quay, once termed by historian [[Mark Girouard]] 'the noblest quay in Europe', is a mile long from Grattan Quay to Adelphi Quay, though Adelphi Quay is now a residential area. It is still a major focal point for Waterford, commercially and socially, and the face that Waterford presents to those travelling into the city from the north. Near Reginald's Tower is the [[William Vincent Wallace]] Plaza, a monument and amenity built around the time of the millennium that commemorates the Waterford born composer.\n\nJohn Roberts Square is a pedestrianised area that is one of the main focal points of Waterford's modern day commercial centre. It was named after the city's most celebrated architect, John Roberts, and was formed from the junction of Barronstrand Street, Broad Street and George's Street. It is often referred to locally as Red Square, due to the red paving that was used when the area was first pedestrianised. A short distance to the east of John Roberts Square is Arundel Square, another square with a fine commercial tradition, which the City Square shopping centre opens onto.\n\nBallybricken, in the west, just outside the city walls, is thought to have been Waterford's Irishtown, a type of settlement that often formed outside Irish cities to house the Vikings and Irish that had been expelled during the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]]. Ballybricken is an inner city neighbourhood with a long tradition, centred around Ballybricken hill, which was a large, open market-square. Today it has been converted into a green, civic space, but the Bull Post, where livestock was once bought and sold, still stands as a remnant of the hill's past.\n\n[[File:Waterfordcathedral.jpg|thumb|Cathedral of the Most Holy Trinity on Barronstrand Street]]\n\nThe Mall is a fine Georgian thoroughfare, built by the Wide Streets Commission to extend the city southwards. It contains some of the city's finest Georgian architecture. The [[People's Park (Waterford)|People's Park]], Waterford's largest and finest park, is located nearby.\n\nFerrybank, in [[County Waterford]], is Waterford's only suburb north of the river. It contains a village centre of its own.\n\nIn April 2003 an important site combining a 5th-century [[Iron Age]] and 9th century [[Viking]] settlement was discovered at [[Woodstown]] near the city, which appears to have been a Viking town that predates all such settlements in Ireland.<ref>[http://www.vikingwaterford.com/ 9th Century Settlement found at Woodstown] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218104315/http://vikingwaterford.com/ |date=18 December 2014 }} \u2013 vikingwaterford.com</ref>\n\n[[Waterford Crystal]] is manufactured in Waterford but in early 2009 the company moved it operations to continental Europe. A new Waterford Crystal visitor centre opened on 22 June 2010.\n\nWaterford's oldest public house (pub) can be found just outside the old 'Viking Triangle'. T & H Doolan's, of 31/32 George's Street, has been officially active and open to the public for over three hundred years. The official record of licences dates back to the 18th century but the premises is believed to be closer to five hundred years in age. A main element of the structure includes one of the original city walls, almost 1,000 years old, which can be viewed in the lounge area of the building.\n{{-}}\n\n==Economy==\nWaterford is the main city of Ireland's [[South-East Region, Ireland|South-East Region]]. Historically Waterford was an important trading port which brought much prosperity to the city throughout the city's eventful history. Throughout its history Waterford Crystal provided employment to thousands in the city and surrounding areas.\n\nWaterford Port is Ireland's closest deep-water port to mainland Europe, handling approximately 12% of Ireland's external trade by value.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.waterfordcity.ie/documents/reports/WCDB%20Strategy%202002-2012.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812205744/http://www.waterfordcity.ie/documents/reports/WCDB%20Strategy%202002-2012.pdf |archivedate=12 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Waterford's most famous export, [[Waterford Crystal]], is an internationally known and highly sought after product that was manufactured in the city from 1783 to 2009 and again from 2010 to the present day. Places where Waterford Crystal can be seen include New York City, where Waterford Crystal made the 2,668 crystals for the famous New Year's Eve Ball that is dropped each year in [[Times Square]]; [[Westminster Abbey]]; [[Windsor Castle]]; and the [[Kennedy Center]], [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]<ref>Beeson, Trevor (2002).

[[Kilmeadan]], about 5&nbsp;km from the city, was home to a very successful [[co-operative]]. The farmers of the area benefited from the sale of their produce (mostly [[butter]] and [[milk]]) to the co-op. In 1964, all of the co-ops in Waterford amalgamated to become Waterford Co-op. This led to the construction of a [[cheese]] factory on a greenfield site opposite the general store, and Kilmeadan cheese was to become one of the most recognised and successful [[Cheddar cheese|Cheddar]] brands in the world, winning gold and bronze medals in the World Cheese Awards in London in 2005.\n\nWaterford is the site of a number of multinational companies including [[GlaxoSmithKline]], Bausch & Lomb, Nypro Healthcare, [[Sanofi]], West Pharmaceuticals, Hasbro, Teva Pharmaceuticals and Honeywell International.\n\nThe Irish economic recession from 2008 onwards has had a major negative impact on Waterford's economy. A number of multinational companies have closed, including Waterford Crystal (which subsequently reopened) and Talk Talk, which has led to a high level of unemployment. Until 2013 the [[hedge fund]] office of the [[Citibank]] resided here.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/citi-bank-waterford-job-losses-910614-May2013|title=50 jobs lost as Citi Bank announce Waterford office closure|first=Christina|last=Finn|website=Thejournal.ie|accessdate=1 October 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171002022108/http://www.thejournal.ie/citi-bank-waterford-job-losses-910614-May2013/|archivedate=2 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nWaterford Co-op and Avonmore Co-op have merged to form Glanbia plc.<ref>{{Cite book|title=21st Century Business Revised Edition|last=Murphy|first=William|publisher=CJ Fallon|year=2014|isbn=978-0-7144-1923-7|location=Ground Floor \u2013 Block B, Liffey Valley Office Campus, Dublin 22|pages=437|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n==Transport==\n{{Main|Transport in Waterford}}\n\nThe [[M9 motorway (Ireland)|M9 motorway]], which was completed on 9 September 2010, connects the city to [[Dublin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishmotorwayinfo.com/inex/roads/m9/m9.html|title=M9 Motorway|author=Irish Motorway Info|work=irishmotorwayinfo.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721075015/http://www.irishmotorwayinfo.com/inex/roads/m9/m9.html|archivedate=21 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The [[N24 road (Ireland)|N24]] road connects the city to [[Limerick]] city.

Soon, he was drawn into a controversy between two rival schools of Assam Vaishnavism. His erudite exposition of scriptural lore in the various issues of the Banhi under the pseudonym of Babananda Pathak, in defence of the values represented by the teachings of Sankardeva still makes fruitful reading.\n\nWhile studying MA examination in [[English language|English]], he obtained his doctorate for his thesis \u2013 Assamese : Its Formation and Development in 1935. The publication of the thesis in 1941 was a god-send for the Assamese people who had been frantically struggling to establish the identity and provenance of their mother tongue. Kakati had to work far from the great centres of learning, in a place where even Leonard Bloomfields\u2019 Language (1833) could not be made available.

[[Buck Rodgers]] was hired as manager before the 1985 season and guided the Expos to a .500 or better record five times in six years, with the highlight coming in 1987, when they won 91 games.

The lordship was created as a [[Papal fief]] following the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]] in 1169\u20131171. As the lord of Ireland was also the king of [[Kingdom of England|England]], he was represented locally by a [[chief governor of Ireland|governor]], variously known as justiciar, lieutenant, or Lord Deputy.\n\nThe kings of England claimed lordship over the whole island, but in reality the king's rule only ever extended to parts of the island. The rest of the island\u2014known as [[Gaelic Ireland]]\u2014remained under the control of various [[Gaels|Gaelic]] Irish kingdoms or [[chiefdom]]s, who were often at war with the Anglo-Normans.\n\nThe area under English rule and law grew and shrank over time, and reached its greatest extent in the late 13th and early 14th centuries. The lordship then went into decline, brought on by its [[Bruce campaign in Ireland|invasion by Scotland]] in 1315\u201318, the [[Great Famine of 1315\u201317]], and the [[Black Death]] of the 1340s. The fluid political situation and English [[Feudalism|feudal]] system allowed a great deal of autonomy for the [[Normans in Ireland|Anglo-Norman lords in Ireland]], who carved out earldoms for themselves and had almost as much authority as some of the native Gaelic kings. Some Anglo-Normans became [[Gaelicisation|Gaelicised]] and rebelled against the English administration. The English attempted to curb this by passing the [[Statutes of Kilkenny]] (1366), which forbade English settlers from taking up Irish law, language, custom and dress. The period ended with the creation of the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] in 1542.\n\n==History==\n\n===Arrival of the Normans in Ireland===\nThe authority of the Lordship of Ireland's government was seldom extended throughout the island of Ireland at any time during its existence but was restricted to [[the Pale]] around [[Dublin]], and some provincial towns, including [[Cork (city)|Cork]], [[Limerick]], [[Waterford]], [[Wexford]] and their hinterlands. It owed its origins to the decision of a Leinster dynast, Diarmait Mac Murchada ([[Diarmuid MacMorrough]]), to bring in a Norman knight based in Wales, [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke]] (alias 'Strongbow'), to aid him in his battle to regain his throne, after being overthrown by a confederation led by the new [[High King of Ireland|Irish High King]] (the previous incumbent had protected MacMurrough). [[Henry II of England]] invaded Ireland to control Strongbow, who he feared was becoming a threat to the stability of his own kingdom on its western fringes (there had been earlier fears that Saxon refugees might use either Ireland or Flanders as a base for a counter-offensive after 1066); much of the later [[Plantagenet]] consolidation of [[South Wales]] was in furtherance of holding open routes to Ireland.\n\n===Henry Plantagenet and ''[[Laudabiliter]]''===\n\nFrom 1155 Henry claimed that [[Pope Adrian IV]] had given him authorisation to reform the Irish church by assuming control of Ireland. Religious practices and ecclesiastical organisation in Ireland had evolved divergently from those in areas of Europe influenced more directly by the [[Holy See]], although many of these differences had been eliminated or greatly lessened by the time the bull was issued in 1155.<ref>{{citation | first = Austin Lane | last =  Poole | title = From Domesday book to Magna Carta, 1087\u20131216 | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1993 | page = 303}}.</ref> Further, the former [[Celtic Christianity|Irish church]] had never sent its dues (\"[[tithe]]s\") to Rome. Henry's primary motivation for invading Ireland in 1171 was to control Strongbow and other Norman lords. In the process he accepted the [[fealty]] of the [[Gaels|Gaelic]] kings at Dublin in November 1171 and summoned the [[Synod of Cashel]] in 1172, this bringing the Irish Church into conformity with English and European norms.\n\nIn 1175 the [[Treaty of Windsor (1175)|Treaty of Windsor]] was agreed by Henry and [[Ruaidr\u00ed Ua Conchobair]], [[High King of Ireland]].<ref>{{citation|title=Early Medieval Ireland, 400-1200|author=Aibhm O Croinin|publisher=Routledge|location=London|year=2013|page=6|quote=1175: Treaty of Windsor between Ruaidri Ua Conchobhair, high-king, and Henry II. 1183: Ruaidri Ua Conchobhair deposed.}}</ref>\n\nThe popes asserted the right to grant sovereignty over islands to different monarchs on the basis of the [[Donation of Constantine]] (now known to be a forgery). Doubts were cast by eminent scholars on ''[[Laudabiliter]]'' itself in the 19th century, but it was confirmed by the letters of [[Pope Alexander III]]. The Papal power to grant also fell within the remit of ''[[Dictatus papae]]'' (1075\u20131087).  While ''Laudabiliter'' had referred to the \"kingdom\" of Ireland, the Papacy was ambiguous about continuing to describe it as a kingdom as early as 1185.\n\n===John Lackland as Lord of Ireland===\n{{main|John's first expedition to Ireland}}\nHaving captured a small part of Ireland on the east coast, Henry used the land to solve a dispute dividing his family.  For he had divided his territories between his sons, with the youngest being nicknamed ''Johan sanz Terre'' (in English, \"[[John, King of England|John Lackland]]\") as he was left without lands to rule.  At the [[Oxford]] parliament in May 1177, Henry replaced [[William FitzAldelm]] and granted John his Irish lands, so becoming Lord of Ireland (''Dominus Hiberniae'') in 1177 when he was 10 years old, with the territory being known in English as the Lordship of Ireland.\n\nHenry had wanted John to be crowned King of Ireland on his first visit in 1185, but [[Pope Lucius III]] specifically refused permission, citing the dubious nature of a claim  supposedly provided by Pope Adrian IV years earlier.<ref>{{citation | last = McLoughlin | first =William | title = \nPope Adrian IV, a Friend of Ireland | publisher = Browne and Nolan | place = Cork, IE | year = 1906 | page = 100}}. </ref>  \"Dominus\" was the usual title of a king who had not yet been crowned, suggesting that it was Henry's intention. Lucius then died while John was in Ireland, and Henry obtained consent from [[Pope Urban III]] and ordered a crown of gold and [[peacock]] feathers for John. In late 1185 the crown was ready, but John's visit had by then proved a complete failure, so Henry cancelled the coronation.<ref name = \"Warren\">{{citation | last = Warren | first = WL | title = King John | publisher = Eyre & Spottiswoode | place = London, ENG, UK | year = 1960 | page = 35}}.</ref>\n\nFollowing the deaths of John's older brothers he became King of England in 1199, and so the Lordship of Ireland, instead of being a separate country ruled by a junior Norman prince, came under the direct rule of the [[Angevin Empire|Angevin]] crown. In the legal terminology of John's successors, the \"lordship of Ireland\" referred to the [[sovereignty]] vested in [[the Crown]] of England; the corresponding territory was referred to as the \"land of Ireland\".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lydon|first=James|date=May 1995|title=Ireland and the English Crown, 1171-1541|journal=Irish Historical Studies|publisher=Cambridge University Press |jstor=30006815|volume=29|issue=115|pages=281\u2013294 : 282|doi=10.1017/S0021121400011834}}</ref>\n\n===Perennial struggle with Gaeldom===\n{{main|History of Ireland 1169\u20131536}}\n[[File:Ireland 1450.png|thumb|right|The Pale (grey) in 1450]]\n{{History of Ireland}}\nThe Lordship thrived in the 13th century during the [[Medieval Warm Period]], a time of warm climate and better harvests. The [[feudal system]] was introduced, and the [[Parliament of Ireland]] first sat in 1297. Some counties were created by [[shiring]], while walled towns and castles became a feature of the landscape. But little of this engagement with mainstream European life was of benefit to those the Normans called the \"mere Irish\". \"Mere\" derived from the Latin ''merus'', meaning \"pure\". Environmental decay and deforestation continued unabated throughout this period, being greatly exacerbated by the English newcomers and an increase in population.\n\nThe Norman \u00e9lite and churchmen spoke Norman French and Latin. Many poorer settlers spoke English, Welsh, and Flemish. The Gaelic areas spoke Irish dialects. The [[Yola language]] of [[County Wexford]] was a survivor of the early English dialects. The [[Kildare Poems]] of c. 1350 are a rare example of humorous local culture written in Middle English. \n\nThe Lordship suffered invasion from Scotland by [[Edward Bruce]] in 1315\u20131318, which destroyed much of the economy and coincided with the [[Great Famine of 1315\u20131317|great famine of 1315\u20131317]]. The [[earldom of Ulster]] ended in 1333, and the [[Black Death]] of 1348\u20131350 impacted more on the town-dwelling Normans than on the remaining [[Gaels|Gaelic]] clans. The Norman and English colonists exhibited a tendency to adopt much of the native culture and language, becoming \"Gaelicized\" or in the words of some \"[[More Irish than the Irish themselves]]\". In 1366 the [[Statute of Kilkenny]] tried to keep aspects of Gaelic culture out of the Norman-controlled areas albeit in vain.  As the Norman lordships became increasingly Gaelicized and made alliances with native chiefs, whose power steadily increased, crown control slowly eroded. Additionally, the [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenet]] government increasingly alienated the Irish chiefs and people on whom they often relied for their military strength. It had been a common practice for the Norman lordships as well as government forces to recruit the native Irish who were allied to them or living in English controlled areas (i.e. [[County Meath|Meath]], [[Leinster]], [[Kingdom of Ossory|Ossory]], [[Munster]] and [[Connacht]]). This was easy to do as the native Irish had no great sense of national identity at that time and were prone to [[mercenarism]] and shifting alliances. But the Irish chiefs became increasingly alienated by the oppressive measures of the English government and began openly rebelling against the crown. Some of the more notable among those clans who had formerly cooperated with the English but became increasingly alienated until turning openly anti-Norman and a thorn in the side of the Dublin administration were the O'Connor Falys, the [[MacMurrough-Kavanagh dynasty]], the [[Byrne]]s and the O'Mores of Leix. These clans were able to successfully defend their territories against English attack for a very long time through the use of asymmetrical guerrilla warfare and devastating raids into the lands held by the colonists. Additionally, the power of native chiefs who had never come under English domination such as the O'Neills and the O'Donnells increased steadily until these became once again major power players on the scene of Irish politics. Historians refer to a Gaelic revival or resurgence as occurring between 1350 and 1500, by which time the area ruled for the Crown \u2013 \"[[the Pale]]\" \u2013 had shrunk to a small area around Dublin.\n\nBetween 1500 and 1542 a mixed situation arose. Most clans remained loyal to the Crown most of the time, at least in theory, but using a Gaelic-style system of alliances based on mutual favours, centered on the [[Lord Deputy]] who was usually the current [[Earl of Kildare]]. The [[Battle of Knockdoe]] in 1504 saw such a coalition army fight the Burkes in Galway. However, a rebellion by the 9th Earl's heir [[Silken Thomas]] in 1535 led on to a less sympathetic system of rule by mainly English-born administrators. The end of this rebellion and Henry VIII's seizure of the Irish monasteries around 1540 led on to his plan to create a new kingdom based on the existing parliament.\n\n===Transformation into a Kingdom===\nEnglish monarchs continued to use the title \"Lord of Ireland\" to refer to their position of conquered lands on the island of Ireland. The title was changed by the [[Crown of Ireland Act 1542|Crown of Ireland Act]] passed by the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] in 1542 when, on [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s demand, he was granted a new title, [[King of Ireland]], with the state renamed the [[Kingdom of Ireland]].

The lordship was created as a [[Papal fief]] following the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]] in 1169\u20131171. As the lord of Ireland was also the king of [[Kingdom of England|England]], he was represented locally by a [[chief governor of Ireland|governor]], variously known as justiciar, lieutenant, or Lord Deputy.\n\nThe kings of England claimed lordship over the whole island, but in reality the king's rule only ever extended to parts of the island. The rest of the island\u2014known as [[Gaelic Ireland]]\u2014remained under the control of various [[Gaels|Gaelic]] Irish kingdoms or [[chiefdom]]s, who were often at war with the Anglo-Normans.\n\nThe area under English rule and law grew and shrank over time, and reached its greatest extent in the late 13th and early 14th centuries. The lordship then went into decline, brought on by its [[Bruce campaign in Ireland|invasion by Scotland]] in 1315\u201318, the [[Great Famine of 1315\u201317]], and the [[Black Death]] of the 1340s. The fluid political situation and English [[Feudalism|feudal]] system allowed a great deal of autonomy for the [[Normans in Ireland|Anglo-Norman lords in Ireland]], who carved out earldoms for themselves and had almost as much authority as some of the native Gaelic kings. Some Anglo-Normans became [[Gaelicisation|Gaelicised]] and rebelled against the English administration. The English attempted to curb this by passing the [[Statutes of Kilkenny]] (1366), which forbade English settlers from taking up Irish law, language, custom and dress. The period ended with the creation of the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] in 1542.\n\n==History==\n\n===Arrival of the Normans in Ireland===\nThe authority of the Lordship of Ireland's government was seldom extended throughout the island of Ireland at any time during its existence but was restricted to [[the Pale]] around [[Dublin]], and some provincial towns, including [[Cork (city)|Cork]], [[Limerick]], [[Waterford]], [[Wexford]] and their hinterlands. It owed its origins to the decision of a Leinster dynast, Diarmait Mac Murchada ([[Diarmuid MacMorrough]]), to bring in a Norman knight based in Wales, [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke]] (alias 'Strongbow'), to aid him in his battle to regain his throne, after being overthrown by a confederation led by the new [[High King of Ireland|Irish High King]] (the previous incumbent had protected MacMurrough). [[Henry II of England]] invaded Ireland to control Strongbow, who he feared was becoming a threat to the stability of his own kingdom on its western fringes (there had been earlier fears that Saxon refugees might use either Ireland or Flanders as a base for a counter-offensive after 1066); much of the later [[Plantagenet]] consolidation of [[South Wales]] was in furtherance of holding open routes to Ireland.\n\n===Henry Plantagenet and ''[[Laudabiliter]]''===\n\nFrom 1155 Henry claimed that [[Pope Adrian IV]] had given him authorisation to reform the Irish church by assuming control of Ireland. Religious practices and ecclesiastical organisation in Ireland had evolved divergently from those in areas of Europe influenced more directly by the [[Holy See]], although many of these differences had been eliminated or greatly lessened by the time the bull was issued in 1155.<ref>{{citation | first = Austin Lane | last =  Poole | title = From Domesday book to Magna Carta, 1087\u20131216 | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1993 | page = 303}}.</ref> Further, the former [[Celtic Christianity|Irish church]] had never sent its dues (\"[[tithe]]s\") to Rome. Henry's primary motivation for invading Ireland 1171 was to control Strongbow and other Norman lords. In the process he accepted the [[fealty]] of the [[Gaels|Gaelic]] kings at Dublin in November 1171, and he summoned the [[Synod of Cashel]] in 1172, which brought the Irish Church into conformity with English and European norms.\n\nIn 1175 the [[Treaty of Windsor (1175)|Treaty of Windsor]] was agreed by Henry and [[Ruaidr\u00ed Ua Conchobair]], [[High King of Ireland]].<ref>{{citation|title=Early Medieval Ireland, 400-1200|author=Aibhm O Croinin|publisher=Routledge|location=London|year=2013|page=6|quote=1175: Treaty of Windsor between Ruaidri Ua Conchobhair, high-king, and Henry II. 1183: Ruaidri Ua Conchobhair deposed.}}</ref>\n\nThe popes asserted the right to grant sovereignty over islands to different monarchs on the basis of the [[Donation of Constantine]] (now known to be a forgery). Doubts were cast by eminent scholars on ''[[Laudabiliter]]'' itself in the 19th century, but it was confirmed by the letters of [[Pope Alexander III]]. The Papal power to grant also fell within the remit of ''[[Dictatus papae]]'' (1075\u20131087).  While ''Laudabiliter'' had referred to the \"kingdom\" of Ireland, the Papacy was ambiguous about continuing to describe it as a kingdom as early as 1185.\n\n===John Lackland as Lord of Ireland===\n{{main|John's first expedition to Ireland}}\nHaving captured a small part of Ireland on the east coast, Henry used the land to solve a dispute dividing his family.  For he had divided his territories between his sons, with the youngest being nicknamed ''Johan sanz Terre'' (in English, \"[[John, King of England|John Lackland]]\") as he was left without lands to rule.  At the [[Oxford]] parliament in May 1177, Henry replaced [[William FitzAldelm]] and granted John his Irish lands, so becoming Lord of Ireland (''Dominus Hiberniae'') in 1177 when he was 10 years old, with the territory being known in English as the Lordship of Ireland.\n\nHenry had wanted John to be crowned King of Ireland on his first visit in 1185, but [[Pope Lucius III]] specifically refused permission, citing the dubious nature of a claim  supposedly provided by Pope Adrian IV years earlier.<ref>{{citation | last = McLoughlin | first =William | title = \nPope Adrian IV, a Friend of Ireland | publisher = Browne and Nolan | place = Cork, IE | year = 1906 | page = 100}}. </ref>  \"Dominus\" was the usual title of a king who had not yet been crowned, suggesting that it was Henry's intention. Lucius then died while John was in Ireland, and Henry obtained consent from [[Pope Urban III]] and ordered a crown of gold and [[peacock]] feathers for John. In late 1185 the crown was ready, but John's visit had by then proved a complete failure, so Henry cancelled the coronation.<ref name = \"Warren\">{{citation | last = Warren | first = WL | title = King John | publisher = Eyre & Spottiswoode | place = London, ENG, UK | year = 1960 | page = 35}}.</ref>\n\nFollowing the deaths of John's older brothers he became King of England in 1199, and so the Lordship of Ireland, instead of being a separate country ruled by a junior Norman prince, came under the direct rule of the [[Angevin Empire|Angevin]] crown. In the legal terminology of John's successors, the \"lordship of Ireland\" referred to the [[sovereignty]] vested in [[the Crown]] of England; the corresponding territory was referred to as the \"land of Ireland\".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lydon|first=James|date=May 1995|title=Ireland and the English Crown, 1171-1541|journal=Irish Historical Studies|publisher=Cambridge University Press |jstor=30006815|volume=29|issue=115|pages=281\u2013294 : 282|doi=10.1017/S0021121400011834}}</ref>\n\n===Perennial struggle with Gaeldom===\n{{main|History of Ireland 1169\u20131536}}\n[[File:Ireland 1450.png|thumb|right|The Pale (grey) in 1450]]\n{{History of Ireland}}\nThe Lordship thrived in the 13th century during the [[Medieval Warm Period]], a time of warm climate and better harvests. The [[feudal system]] was introduced, and the [[Parliament of Ireland]] first sat in 1297. Some counties were created by [[shiring]], while walled towns and castles became a feature of the landscape. But little of this engagement with mainstream European life was of benefit to those the Normans called the \"mere Irish\". \"Mere\" derived from the Latin ''merus'', meaning \"pure\". Environmental decay and deforestation continued unabated throughout this period, being greatly exacerbated by the English newcomers and an increase in population.\n\nThe Norman \u00e9lite and churchmen spoke Norman French and Latin. Many poorer settlers spoke English, Welsh, and Flemish. The Gaelic areas spoke Irish dialects. The [[Yola language]] of [[County Wexford]] was a survivor of the early English dialects. The [[Kildare Poems]] of c. 1350 are a rare example of humorous local culture written in Middle English. \n\nThe Lordship suffered invasion from Scotland by [[Edward Bruce]] in 1315\u20131318, which destroyed much of the economy and coincided with the [[Great Famine of 1315\u20131317|great famine of 1315\u20131317]]. The [[earldom of Ulster]] ended in 1333, and the [[Black Death]] of 1348\u20131350 impacted more on the town-dwelling Normans than on the remaining [[Gaels|Gaelic]] clans. The Norman and English colonists exhibited a tendency to adopt much of the native culture and language, becoming \"Gaelicized\" or in the words of some \"[[More Irish than the Irish themselves]]\". In 1366 the [[Statute of Kilkenny]] tried to keep aspects of Gaelic culture out of the Norman-controlled areas albeit in vain.  As the Norman lordships became increasingly Gaelicized and made alliances with native chiefs, whose power steadily increased, crown control slowly eroded. Additionally, the [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenet]] government increasingly alienated the Irish chiefs and people on whom they often relied for their military strength. It had been a common practice for the Norman lordships as well as government forces to recruit the native Irish who were allied to them or living in English controlled areas (i.e. [[County Meath|Meath]], [[Leinster]], [[Kingdom of Ossory|Ossory]], [[Munster]] and [[Connacht]]). This was easy to do as the native Irish had no great sense of national identity at that time and were prone to [[mercenarism]] and shifting alliances. But the Irish chiefs became increasingly alienated by the oppressive measures of the English government and began openly rebelling against the crown. Some of the more notable among those clans who had formerly cooperated with the English but became increasingly alienated until turning openly anti-Norman and a thorn in the side of the Dublin administration were the O'Connor Falys, the [[MacMurrough-Kavanagh dynasty]], the [[Byrne]]s and the O'Mores of Leix. These clans were able to successfully defend their territories against English attack for a very long time through the use of asymmetrical guerrilla warfare and devastating raids into the lands held by the colonists. Additionally, the power of native chiefs who had never come under English domination such as the O'Neills and the O'Donnells increased steadily until these became once again major power players on the scene of Irish politics. Historians refer to a Gaelic revival or resurgence as occurring between 1350 and 1500, by which time the area ruled for the Crown \u2013 \"[[the Pale]]\" \u2013 had shrunk to a small area around Dublin.\n\nBetween 1500 and 1542 a mixed situation arose. Most clans remained loyal to the Crown most of the time, at least in theory, but using a Gaelic-style system of alliances based on mutual favours, centered on the [[Lord Deputy]] who was usually the current [[Earl of Kildare]]. The [[Battle of Knockdoe]] in 1504 saw such a coalition army fight the Burkes in Galway. However, a rebellion by the 9th Earl's heir [[Silken Thomas]] in 1535 led on to a less sympathetic system of rule by mainly English-born administrators. The end of this rebellion and Henry VIII's seizure of the Irish monasteries around 1540 led on to his plan to create a new kingdom based on the existing parliament.\n\n===Transformation into a Kingdom===\nEnglish monarchs continued to use the title \"Lord of Ireland\" to refer to their position of conquered lands on the island of Ireland. The title was changed by the [[Crown of Ireland Act 1542|Crown of Ireland Act]] passed by the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] in 1542 when, on [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s demand, he was granted a new title, [[King of Ireland]], with the state renamed the [[Kingdom of Ireland]]. Henry VIII changed his title because the Lordship of Ireland had been granted to the Norman monarchy by the Papacy; Henry had been excommunicated by the Catholic Church and worried that his title could be withdrawn by the [[Holy See]]. Henry VIII also wanted Ireland to be become a full kingdom to encourage a greater sense of loyalty amongst his Irish subjects, some of whom took part in his policy of [[surrender and regrant]]. To provide for greater security, a [[Royal Irish Army]] was established.\n\n==Parliament==\nThe government was based in Dublin, but the members of Parliament could be summoned to meet anywhere:\n{{colbegin}}\n*1310 [[Kilkenny]]\n*1320 Dublin\n*1324 Dublin\n*1327 Dublin\n*1328 Kilkenny\n*1329 Dublin\n*1330 Kilkenny\n*1331 Kilkenny\n*1331 Dublin\n*1341 Dublin\n*1346 Kilkenny\n*1350 Kilkenny\n*1351 Kilkenny\n*1351 Dublin\n*1353 Dublin\n*1357 Kilkenny\n*1359 Kilkenny\n*1359 Waterford\n*1360 Kilkenny\n*1366 Kilkenny\n*1369 Dublin\n{{colend}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[History of Ireland]]\n**[[History of Ireland 1169\u20131536]]\n*[[Monarchy of Ireland#Lords of Ireland 1177\u20131542|List of Lords of Ireland]]\n*[[Ireland King of Arms]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* {{citation | first = Norman | last = Davies | title = The Isles: A History | publisher = Palgrave-Macmillan | year = 1999 | isbn = 0-333-76370-X}}.\n* {{citation | first = Robin | last = Frame | title = English Lordship in Ireland 1318\u20131361 | publisher = Clarendon Press | year = 1982 | isbn = 0-19-822673-X}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.historyireland.com/volume-23/free-gaelic-people-in-english-ireland-c-1250-c-1327/ Free Gaelic people in English Ireland, c. 1250\u2013c. 1327] at [[History Ireland]]\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-bef|before = [[Gaelic Ireland]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title  = Lordship of Ireland}}\n{{s-aft|after  = [[Kingdom of Ireland]]}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{Irish states since 1171}}\n{{Ireland topics}}\n\n{{coord|53|20|N|6|15|W|type:country_source:kolossus-ptwiki|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lordship Of Ireland}}\n[[Category:States and territories established in 1171]]\n[[Category:Medieval Ireland]]\n[[Category:Lordship of Ireland| ]]\n[[Category:Former monarchies of Europe|Ireland (1171-1541)]]\n[[Category:Former countries in Ireland]]\n[[Category:1171 establishments in Europe]]\n[[Category:1542 disestablishments in Europe]]\n", "name_user": "Piggs mcginty", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHenry Plantagenet and Laudabiliter", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lordship_of_Ireland"}
