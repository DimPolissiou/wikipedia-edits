Thomas Dawes, Esq.,\" 1809, Boston Athenaeum Library, Tracts B438, B1213.</ref>\n\nOld South Meeting House was almost destroyed in the [[Great Boston Fire of 1872]], saved by the timely arrival of a fire engine from Portsmouth, New Hampshire, but the fire caused the city's residential districts to shift toward the Back Bay, away from the church.  The congregation then built a new church building (the \"New\" [[Old South Church]] at [[Copley Square]]) which remains its home to this day. The Old South congregation returns to Old South Meeting House for services in its ancestral home once a year, on the Sunday before [[Thanksgiving]].\n\n[[File:2017 Old South Meeting House steeple 3.jpg|thumb|200px|The steeple (2017)]]\n\n====Ministers====\n* Thomas Thacher (1620\u20131678), minister 1670\u20131678<ref>WorldCat.

Renowned for the protest meetings held here before the American Revolution when the building was termed a ''[[mouth-house]],'' this [[National Historic Landmark]] has long served as a platform for the free expression of ideas. Today, the Old South Meeting House is open daily as a museum and continues to provide a place for people to meet, discuss and act on important issues of the day. The stories of the men and women who are part of Old South's vital heritage reveal why the Old South Meeting House occupies an enduring place in the history of the United States.\n\nThe museum and historic site is located at the intersection of [[Washington Street (Boston)|Washington]] and [[Milk Street, Boston|Milk Street]]s and can be visited for a nominal sum. It is located near the [[State Street (MBTA station)|State Street]], [[Downtown Crossing (MBTA station)|Downtown Crossing]] and [[Park Street station (MBTA)|Park Street]] [[MBTA]] (subway) stations.\n\nThe Old South Meeting House is claimed to be the second oldest establishment existent in the United States. It is currently under consideration for local landmark status by the [[Boston Landmarks Commission]].<ref>https://www.cityofboston.gov/images_documents/PETSTATS_June2016_tcm3-53570.pdf</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=packed heights=\"140px\">\nImage:JosephSewall OldSouth Boston.png|Joseph Sewall, minister ca.1713\u20131769\nImage:ThomasPrince ca1750 byJosephBadger AmericanAntiquarianSociety.png|[[Thomas Prince]], minister ca.1718\u20131758; portrait by [[Joseph Badger]] (courtesy [[American Antiquarian Society]])\nFile:Old South Meeting House American Revolution interior in Boston MA.jpg|Old South Meeting House when the British Army used it for horse riding\nImage:1808 CongressSt Boston 3 copy.png|View of Old South from [[Congress Street (Boston)|Congress Street]] in 1808 (conjectural illustration)\nImage:1835 OldSouth BostonBewickCo Boyton Boston map detail.png|1835\nImage:JacobManning OldSouth Boston.png|Jacob Manning, minister ca.1857\u20131872\nImage:Milk Street, from Robert N.
