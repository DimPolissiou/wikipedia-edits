In ancient times the Greek bread was barley bread: [[Solon]] declared that wheaten bread might only be baked for feast days. By the 5th century BC bread could be purchased in Athens from a baker's shop, and in Rome, Greek bakers appeared in the 2nd century BC, as Hellenized Asia Minor was added to Roman dominion as the [[Asia (Roman province)|province of Asia]];<ref>Toussaint-Samat 2009, p.204 gives a date of 168 for \"a considerable influx of craftsmen bakers (''pistores'') of Greek origin into Rome\".</ref> the foreign bakers of bread were permitted to form a ''[[Collegium (ancient Rome)|collegium]]''.  In the ''[[Deipnosophistae]]'', the author [[Athenaeus]] (c.A.D.170 \u2013 c. 230) describes some of the bread, cakes, and pastries available in the Classical world.<ref>[[Chrysippus of Tyana]] gives a list of thirty kinds, without commentary (Toussaint-Samat 2009, p. 202).</ref> Among the breads mentioned are griddle cakes, honey-and-oil bread, mushroom-shaped loaves covered in poppy seeds, and the military specialty of rolls baked on a spit.  The type and quality of flours used to produce bread could also vary, as noted by [[Diphilus]] when he declared \"bread made of wheat, as compared with that made of [[barley]], is more nourishing, more digestible, and in every way superior.\" In order of merit, the bread made from refined [thoroughly sieved] flour comes first, after that bread from ordinary wheat, and then the unbolted, made of flour that has not been sifted.\"<ref>Tannahill p. 91</ref> The essentiality of bread in the diet was reflected in the name for the rest of the meal: ''\u00f3pson'', \"condiment\", i.e. bread's accompaniment, whatever it might be.<ref>Changes in diet are reflected in the modern significance of ''opson'' as fish (Toussaint-Samat 2009, p. 202); in Italy the ''[[contorni]]'' are now the accompaniment to meat rather than bread.</ref>\n\n==Middle Ages==\n[[File:Peasants breaking bread.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2<!--fmt for low img-->|Peasants sharing bread, from the ''Livre du roi Modus et de la reine Ratio'', France, 14th century.

In the standard table setting of the day the [[Trencher (tableware)|trencher]], a piece of [[staling|stale bread]] roughly 6&nbsp;inches by 4&nbsp;inches (15&nbsp;cm by 10&nbsp;cm), was served as an absorbent plate.  At the completion of a meal the trencher could then be eaten, given to the poor, or fed to the dogs. It was not until the 15th century that trenchers made of wood started to replace the bread variety.<ref>Tannahill p. 227</ref>\n\n==To the 19th century==\n\nUp to the 19th century, bread sold in Europe was often adulterated with hazardous materials, including [[chalk]], [[sawdust]], [[alum]], [[plaster]], [[clay]] and [[ammonium carbonate]]. This gradually came to an end with government action, such as the 1860 and 1899 Food Adulteration Acts in Britain.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Coley |first=Noel |date=1 March 2005 |title=The fight against food adulteration |url=https://eic.rsc.org/feature/the-fight-against-food-adulteration/2020253.article |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=46\u201349 |url-status=live |magazine=[[Education in Chemistry]] |publisher=[[Royal Society of Chemistry]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180614144230/https://eic.rsc.org/feature/the-fight-against-food-adulteration/2020253.article |archive-date=14 June 2018 |access-date=14 June 2018}}</ref> America had a more difficult time ending these processes of adulteration however, as various states had varying policies regarding bread making. <ref> MS., City Clerk's Office, Record Book, 1814-1820, pp. 3, 5. </ref>\n\nIn the late 19th century, the British empire encouraged a noticeable increase in import of bread from the colonies. This was regarded as British bread despite its origins, and institutes such as the Imperial Economic Committee encouraged the consumption and trade of foods such as bread from across the empire as they viewed it as cementing Britain's position in its colonies further. Advancements in refrigeration technology and techniques also encouraged an increase in the import of bread, as it could be preserved much longer than before and could be transported over longer distances. Bread was transported and stored using refrigeration more than most other foods, particularly in North America, as it was a staple food in most diets, more so than other staple foods like meat. <ref> The Trade Marks Journal. </ref>\n\n==Industrialization==\n\nBread-baking was industrialised at the start of the 20th century. [[Otto Frederick Rohwedder]] developed a prototype [[sliced bread|bread-slicing]] machine in 1912, and a practical machine that both sliced and wrapped bread in 1928.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chillicothecity.org/bread/breadnews1.html#070708|title=Sliced Bread Turns 80 Years Old|date=July 7, 2008|work=Chillicothe Constitution-Tribune|accessdate=July 6, 2011}}</ref><ref>It occupies a section in [[Sigfried Giedion]], [1948] 1969.

In ancient times the Greek bread was barley bread: [[Solon]] declared that wheaten bread might only be baked for feast days. By the 5th century BC bread could be purchased in Athens from a baker's shop, and in Rome, Greek bakers appeared in the 2nd century BC, as Hellenized Asia Minor was added to Roman dominion as the [[Asia (Roman province)|province of Asia]];<ref>Toussaint-Samat 2009, p.204 gives a date of 168 for \"a considerable influx of craftsmen bakers (''pistores'') of Greek origin into Rome\".</ref> the foreign bakers of bread were permitted to form a ''[[Collegium (ancient Rome)|collegium]]''.  In the ''[[Deipnosophistae]]'', the author [[Athenaeus]] (c.A.D.170 \u2013 c. 230) describes some of the bread, cakes, and pastries available in the Classical world.<ref>[[Chrysippus of Tyana]] gives a list of thirty kinds, without commentary (Toussaint-Samat 2009, p. 202).</ref> Among the breads mentioned are griddle cakes, honey-and-oil bread, mushroom-shaped loaves covered in poppy seeds, and the military specialty of rolls baked on a spit.  The type and quality of flours used to produce bread could also vary, as noted by [[Diphilus]] when he declared \"bread made of wheat, as compared with that made of [[barley]], is more nourishing, more digestible, and in every way superior.\" In order of merit, the bread made from refined [thoroughly sieved] flour comes first, after that bread from ordinary wheat, and then the unbolted, made of flour that has not been sifted.\"<ref>Tannahill p. 91</ref> The essentiality of bread in the diet was reflected in the name for the rest of the meal: ''\u00f3pson'', \"condiment\", i.e. bread's accompaniment, whatever it might be.<ref>Changes in diet are reflected in the modern significance of ''opson'' as fish (Toussaint-Samat 2009, p. 202); in Italy the ''[[contorni]]'' are now the accompaniment to meat rather than bread.</ref>\n\n==Middle Ages==\n[[File:Peasants breaking bread.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2<!--fmt for low img-->|Peasants sharing bread, from the ''Livre du roi Modus et de la reine Ratio'', France, 14th century. ([[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France|Biblioth\u00e8que nationale]])]]\n\nIn [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]], bread served not only as a [[staple food]] but also as part of the [[Tableware|table service]].  In the standard table setting of the day the [[Trencher (tableware)|trencher]], a piece of [[staling|stale bread]] roughly 6&nbsp;inches by 4&nbsp;inches (15&nbsp;cm by 10&nbsp;cm), was served as an absorbent plate.  At the completion of a meal the trencher could then be eaten, given to the poor, or fed to the dogs. It was not until the 15th century that trenchers made of wood started to replace the bread variety.<ref>Tannahill p. 227</ref>\n\n==To the 19th century==\n\nUp to the 19th century, bread sold in Europe was often adulterated with hazardous materials, including [[chalk]], [[sawdust]], [[alum]], [[plaster]], [[clay]] and [[ammonium carbonate]]. This gradually came to an end with government action, such as the 1860 and 1899 Food Adulteration Acts in Britain.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Coley |first=Noel |date=1 March 2005 |title=The fight against food adulteration |url=https://eic.rsc.org/feature/the-fight-against-food-adulteration/2020253.article |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=46\u201349 |url-status=live |magazine=[[Education in Chemistry]] |publisher=[[Royal Society of Chemistry]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180614144230/https://eic.rsc.org/feature/the-fight-against-food-adulteration/2020253.article |archive-date=14 June 2018 |access-date=14 June 2018}}</ref> America had a more difficult time ending these processes of adulteration however, as various states had varying policies regarding bread making. <ref> MS., City Clerk's Office, Record Book, 1814-1820, pp. 3, 5. </ref>\n\nIn the late 19th century, the British empire encouraged a noticeable increase in import of bread from the colonies. This was regarded as British bread despite its origins, and institutes such as the Imperial Economic Committee encouraged the consumption and trade of foods such as bread from across the empire as they viewed it as cementing Britain's position in its colonies further. Advancements in refrigeration technology and techniques also encouraged an increase in the import of bread, as it could be preserved much longer than before and could be transported over longer distances. Bread was transported and stored using refrigeration more than most other foods, particularly in North America, as it was a staple food in most diets, more so than other staple foods like meat. <ref> The Trade Marks Journal. </ref>\n\n==Industrialization==\n\nBread-baking was industrialised at the start of the 20th century. [[Otto Frederick Rohwedder]] developed a prototype [[sliced bread|bread-slicing]] machine in 1912, and a practical machine that both sliced and wrapped bread in 1928.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chillicothecity.org/bread/breadnews1.html#070708|title=Sliced Bread Turns 80 Years Old|date=July 7, 2008|work=Chillicothe Constitution-Tribune|accessdate=July 6, 2011}}</ref><ref>It occupies a section in [[Sigfried Giedion]], [1948] 1969.

However, in most western societies, the connotations reversed in the late 20th century, with whole-grain bread becoming preferred as having superior nutritional value while Chorleywood bread became associated with lower-class ignorance of nutrition.<ref>Christianne L.H.

Dough that does not require fermentation because of chemical additives is called \"quick bread\" by commercial bakers. Common additives include reducing agents such as [[Cysteine|L-cysteine]] or [[sodium metabisulfite]], and oxidants such as [[potassium bromate]] or [[ascorbic acid]];<ref>{{cite book |last=Pyler |first=Ernst John |title=Our Daily Bread |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_EaPQAAACAAJ |year=1958 |publisher=Siebel |page=703}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Elkassabany |first=M. |last2=Hoseney |first2=R.C. |last3=Seib |first3=P.A. |year=1980 |title=Ascorbic Acid as an Oxidant in Wheat Flour Dough.

The film was a critical and commercial  failure. A manga adaptation of the film, also from Tezuka and [[Hisashi Sakaguchi]], was released later that same year in [[October]] exclusively in [[COM (manga magazine)]], and was recently reprinted back in late 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2018-11-17/osamu-tezuka-erotic-cleopatra-manga-gets-limited-edition-reprint/.139389|title=Osamu Tezuka's Erotic Cleopatra Manga Gets Limited Edition Reprint|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn the far future, three humans\u2014Jiro, Harvey, and Mary\u2014discover that an alien race called the Pasateli intends to conquer humankind by the mysterious \"Cleopatra plan\". Through the use of a time machine, the three transport their minds into the bodies of members of the historical Cleopatra's court to discover and stop the plan. Harvey, however, vows to use the opportunity to secure the title of the greatest lover who ever lived by having sex with Cleopatra.\n\nIn the middle of the Roman conquest of Egypt, a group of Egyptians secretly plot a rebellion to overthrow [[Julius Caesar]]. The group plans to send Cleopatra to first seduce and then murder Caesar. The Romans discover the group and attack them. Cleopatra escapes, along with her handmaidens Libya and Apollodoria. Cleopatra goes to an ancient wizard, who magically grants her an irresistibly seductive body for her mission.\n\nIt is at this point that the Jiro, Harvey, and Mary arrive: Mary is now Libya, Harvey finds himself in the body of the wizard's pet leopard Rupa, thwarting his plans to seduce Cleopatra and Jiro finds himself in the body of Ionius, a Greek man captured and enslaved by the Romans. Ionius frees himself and the other slaves by using his knowledge of future technology to make modern hand grenades. They accompany Cleopatra to meet Caesar, who is so overcome by her beauty that he makes her queen of Egypt. Caesar recaptures Ionius and, amused by his fighting skills, orders him to fight in the gladiatorial arena. He gives Ionius a gun to ensure his victory. Ionius proves so popular with the Roman public that Caesar's own popularity soars, leading his senators to conspire to murder both him and Ionius and end their influence.\n\nLibya and Apollodoria insist that Cleopatra must murder Caesar; Cleopatra, however, has had a change of heart and keeps putting off the assassination in favor of sex. They accompany Caesar back to Rome, just in time for him to be assassinated by his own senators. Caesar's adopted son, Augustus Caesar\u2014soon to be called Octavian\u2014takes command. Cleopatra tries to continue the plan by seducing Octavian, only to find that he is homosexual and impervious to her charms. Caesar's right-hand man, Marcus Antonius or known as Anthony, fall in love and have sex with Cleopatra. Octavian, however, is attracted to Ionius and spares his life.\n\nFinally, During the Battle of Actium where Octavian's fleet, defeats the Anthony-Egyptian fleet, Anthony loses the battle and kills himself, Octavian goes to Cleopatra trying to persuade her to surrender and taken into custody by the Romans. Disappointed by the rejection after Anthony's death, Cleopatra commits suicide by using the venomous bite of an asp.\n\nThe time travelers return to the future and report that the Cleopatra plan is a scheme by the Pasateli to assume the form of beautiful human women to seduce and destroy Earth's most powerful male leaders. The Pasateli have already taken their human forms and are poised to strike when this information arrives, but Earth is able to root them out and save the world in time.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Chinatsu Nakayama]] as [[Cleopatra]]\n*[[Hajime Hana]] as [[Julius Caesar]]\n*[[Osami Nabe]] as [[Marcus Antonius]]\n*[[Jitsuko Yoshimura]] as Mary/Libya\n*[[Tsubame Yanagiya]] as Harvey/Rupa\n*[[Nobuo Tsukamoto]] as Jiro/Ionius\n*[[Kazuko Imai]] as [[Calpurnia (wife of Caesar)|Calpurnia]]\n*[[Susumu Abe]] as Cabagonis\n*[[Nachi Nozawa]] as [[Octavian]]\n*[[Kotoe Hatsui]] as Apollodoria\n*[[Yoshir\u014d Kat\u014d]] as Chief Tarabahha\n\n==Release and Home Video==\nIn 1972, [[Mushi Productions]], who made the film, accepted a deal with [[Xanadu Productions Inc.]], a small distributor,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?companies=co0118493|title=With Xanadu Productions Inc.
