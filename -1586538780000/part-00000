On June 28, 2013, Jack City was forced to reduce its Free TV broadcast to 18 hours a day on BEAM in compliance with the National Telecommunications Commission's guidelines. However, it still continues to air as a cable channel 24 hours a day.\n\nOn July 16, 2014, the day that [[Metro Manila]] was crippled by [[Typhoon Rammasun|\"Typhoon Glenda (Rammasun)\"]], the station became inactive. It was later found out that the transmitter located in Palos Verdes in [[Antipolo|Antipolo City]], [[Rizal]] received a total damage to some of its facilities done by the said typhoon. As a result, the station shuts down temporarily for another maintenance, and continued its telecast on cable networks. Somehow it resumed telecast on August 10, 2014 at 9:00 PM, but still under observation.\n\n====Digital television broadcast====\nOn September 1, 2014, Jack City ceased its affiliation status on BEAM Channel 31 and its provincial affiliates, as BEAM prepares its ISDB-T digital television. However, Jack City continues to broadcast on pay TV networks until March 21, 2015, when the channel was rebranded as [[CT (TV channel)|CT]] a day later on March 22, 2015.\n\nAt the same day, it began using blocktime programs from [[O Shopping]] (of [[ABS-CBN Corporation]] and [[CJ Group]] of Korea) and several programs from [[Trinity Broadcasting Network|TBN Asia]] (including The 700 Club Asia and Praise the Lord) along with religious programming produced by the Essential Broadcasting Network under the leadership of Bro. Greg Durante of Greg Durante Ministries.\n\nOn November 15, 2014, the channel is carried over [[SkyCable]], [[Destiny Cable]] and other Pay TV subscribers (per compliance with NTC's \"must-carry\" basis), displacing Jack City to a different cable channel assignment, which is only available for subscribers residing in Metro Manila and neighboring provinces. This also makes BEAM available to cable viewers 24 hours a day once again when it took effect four months later, on March 12, 2015.\n\nOn March 1, 2015, TV Shop Philippines (also known as revival of Value Vision) began airing on this channel in the afternoon, followed by selected Tagalog-dubbed telenovelas carried from the [[Telenovela Channel]] on nighttime.\n\nOn March 9, 2015, the channel also added Shop Japan to its programming during morning hours; [[Shop TV]] began its infomercial service on February 22, 2016 (Shop TV, ironically, is owned by BEAM's former blocktime partner Solar Entertainment), but would end transmission with BEAM after December 31, 2018.\n\nBy March 1, 2016, all of BEAM's programs were split into digital television streams. O Shopping, TBN, TV Shop and Shop Japan were relocated as their respective digital subchannel of its own; while BEAM became an affiliate of Shop TV in its analog signal, allowing it to cover most of BEAM's airtime (Tagalog-dubbed telenovelas remained on the analog channel during primetime).\n\nIn May 2016, BEAM added the live video streaming service of ''[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]'' and [[Trans-Radio Broadcasting Corporation]]'s [[DZIQ|Radyo Inquirer 990]] as its new subchannel affiliate, coinciding with the [[2016 Philippine general election|2016 Philippine elections]].<ref>[http://radyo.inquirer.net/30405/the-election-coverage-with-inquirer-990-tv The Election Coverage with Inquirer 990 TV]. Retrieved May 12, 2016.</ref> Within the same month, Bacolod City-based travel and lifestyle cable channel Island Living (broadcasting its programs through provincial cable operators including some affiliates of [[SkyCable]] from Visayas and Mindanao) became BEAM's new subchannel, followed by the replacement of TBN Asia with Taiwan-based Christian pay TV channel GOOD TV (which is in fact aired as a former blocktime program from Light Network (now [[ZOE Broadcasting Network|Light TV]]) and as a standalone channel on [[Destiny Cable]] and [[Cignal]]). GOOD TV PH, however, was replaced by infomercial service EZShop weeks later. Its channel space on digital television remains vacant since July 2016, with GCTV returned a few months later.\n\nThe channel split of BEAM was finally completed in August 2016 when telenovelas were removed from the network's main/analog feed. Since then, constant changes occur on its digital subchannels from time to time.\n\nOn January 4, 2020, BEAM's digital transmission was changed frequency from UHF channel 32 to 50.\n\n==Programming==\n{{main|List of programs broadcast by BEAM TV}}\n\n==Digital television==\n===Digital channels===\n<!-- PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE INFORMATION BEYOND THIS AREA.-->\nDWKC-TV currently operates on UHF Channel 50 <!---Don't Edit this!

However, it still continues to air as a cable channel 24 hours a day.\n\nOn July 16, 2014, the day that [[Metro Manila]] was crippled by [[Typhoon Rammasun|\"Typhoon Glenda (Rammasun)\"]], the station became inactive. It was later found out that the transmitter located in Palos Verdes in [[Antipolo|Antipolo City]], [[Rizal]] received a total damage to some of its facilities done by the said typhoon. As a result, the station shuts down temporarily for another maintenance, and continued its telecast on cable networks. Somehow it resumed telecast on August 10, 2014 at 9:00 PM, but still under observation.\n\n====Digital television broadcast====\nOn September 1, 2014, Jack City ceased its affiliation status on BEAM Channel 31 and its provincial affiliates, as BEAM prepares its ISDB-T digital television. However, Jack City continues to broadcast on pay TV networks until March 21, 2015, when the channel was rebranded as [[CT (TV channel)|CT]] a day later on March 22, 2015.\n\nAt the same day, it began using blocktime programs from [[O Shopping]] (of [[ABS-CBN Corporation]] and [[CJ Group]] of Korea) and several programs from [[Trinity Broadcasting Network|TBN Asia]] (including The 700 Club Asia and Praise the Lord) along with religious programming produced by the Essential Broadcasting Network under the leadership of Bro. Greg Durante of Greg Durante Ministries.\n\nOn November 15, 2014, the channel is carried over [[SkyCable]], [[Destiny Cable]] and other Pay TV subscribers (per compliance with NTC's \"must-carry\" basis), displacing Jack City to a different cable channel assignment, which is only available for subscribers residing in Metro Manila and neighboring provinces. This also makes BEAM available to cable viewers 24 hours a day once again when it took effect four months later, on March 12, 2015.\n\nOn March 1, 2015, TV Shop Philippines (also known as revival of Value Vision) began airing on this channel in the afternoon, followed by selected Tagalog-dubbed telenovelas carried from the [[Telenovela Channel]] on nighttime.\n\nOn March 9, 2015, the channel also added Shop Japan to its programming during morning hours; [[Shop TV]] began its infomercial service on February 22, 2016 (Shop TV, ironically, is owned by BEAM's former blocktime partner Solar Entertainment), but would end transmission with BEAM after December 31, 2018.\n\nBy March 1, 2016, all of BEAM's programs were split into digital television streams. O Shopping, TBN, TV Shop and Shop Japan were relocated as their respective digital subchannel of its own; while BEAM became an affiliate of Shop TV in its analog signal, allowing it to cover most of BEAM's airtime (Tagalog-dubbed telenovelas remained on the analog channel during primetime).\n\nIn May 2016, BEAM added the live video streaming service of ''[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]'' and [[Trans-Radio Broadcasting Corporation]]'s [[DZIQ|Radyo Inquirer 990]] as its new subchannel affiliate, coinciding with the [[2016 Philippine general election|2016 Philippine elections]].<ref>[http://radyo.inquirer.net/30405/the-election-coverage-with-inquirer-990-tv The Election Coverage with Inquirer 990 TV]. Retrieved May 12, 2016.</ref> Within the same month, Bacolod City-based travel and lifestyle cable channel Island Living (broadcasting its programs through provincial cable operators including some affiliates of [[SkyCable]] from Visayas and Mindanao) became BEAM's new subchannel, followed by the replacement of TBN Asia with Taiwan-based Christian pay TV channel GOOD TV (which is in fact aired as a former blocktime program from Light Network (now [[ZOE Broadcasting Network|Light TV]]) and as a standalone channel on [[Destiny Cable]] and [[Cignal]]). GOOD TV PH, however, was replaced by infomercial service EZShop weeks later. Its channel space on digital television remains vacant since July 2016, with GCTV returned a few months later.\n\nThe channel split of BEAM was finally completed in August 2016 when telenovelas were removed from the network's main/analog feed. Since then, constant changes occur on its digital subchannels from time to time.\n\nOn January 4, 2020, BEAM's digital transmission was changed frequency from UHF channel 32 to 50.\n\n==Programming==\n{{main|List of programs broadcast by BEAM TV}}\n\n==Digital television==\n===Digital channels===\n<!-- PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE INFORMATION BEYOND THIS AREA.-->\nDWKC-TV currently operates on UHF Channel 50 <!---Don't Edit this!

The film stars Gervais as the first human with the ability to lie in a world where people can only tell the truth. The cast includes [[Jennifer Garner]], [[Jonah Hill]], [[Louis C.K.]], [[Rob Lowe]], and [[Tina Fey]].  The film was released in the United States on October 2, 2009.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film is set in an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternative reality]] in which lying does not exist.\n\nMark Bellison is a [[screenwriter]], in a film industry limited to historical readings because there is no fiction. One night he has a date with the beautiful and [[wealth]]y Anna McDoogles. She tells Mark she is not attracted to him, because of his looks and failing financial situation, but is going out with him as a favor to his best friend, Greg Kleinschmidt.\n\nThe next day, Mark is fired from his job because of the lack of interest in his films (which are set in the lackluster [[14th century]]), and his landlord threatens to evict him for not paying his rent. Crestfallen, he goes to the bank to close his account. The teller informs him that the computers are down and asks him how much money he has in his account. Mark then has an [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]] that enables him to tell the world's first lie, which is that he has $800 \u2014 the amount he owed his landlord \u2014 in his account. He then lies in a variety of other circumstances, initially for personal gain; he prevents a police officer from arresting Greg for [[Driving under the influence|drunk driving]], [[Breaking the bank|breaks the bank]] at a [[casino]], and writes a [[screenplay]] about the world being invaded by aliens in the 14th century that ends with the claim that everyone's memories were erased. He becomes wealthy from the film's success. Mark soon realises that lying can also be used to help others, such as stopping his [[Major depressive disorder|depressive]] neighbour Frank Fawcett from committing [[suicide]]. Soon after, Mark convinces Anna to go out with him again. She congratulates Mark for his financial success and admits that he would be a good husband and father, but she is still not attracted to him due to how his genetics/appearance would not be a good factor in how she wants her child to be/look like.\n\nMark then gets a call that his mother, Martha, has had a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and rushes to the hospital. There, the doctor tells him that Martha is going to die. She is scared of death, believing that it will bring an [[Eternal oblivion|eternity of nothingness]]. Mark, through tears, tells her that death instead brings a joyful [[afterlife]], introducing the concept of a [[Heaven]] to her, and she dies happy. Mark soon receives worldwide attention as the news of his supposed information about death spreads. After encouragement from Anna, he tells the world, through \"ten rules\" (mirroring the [[Ten Commandments]]), that he talks to a \"Man In The Sky\" who controls everything and promises great rewards in the good place after death, as long as you do no more than three \"[[sin|bad things]]\".\n\nSome time later, Anna and Mark are together in a park and Anna asks him, if they marry, if his now being rich and famous would make their children more physically attractive. Mark wants to lie, but does not because of his love for Anna, and says \"No\". Meanwhile, Mark's rival, Brad Kessler, pursues Anna romantically, motivated by his jealousy at Mark's success. Though Brad's selfish and cruel manner makes Anna uncomfortable, she continues dating him and they become engaged. Before the wedding, Greg appears and convinces Mark that he has not missed his chance with Anna. Mark reluctantly attends Anna and Brad's wedding, where he objects to the marriage. The officiant, however, informs him that only the Man in the Sky can stop the wedding. Brad and Anna both ask Mark to ask the Man in the Sky what Anna should do, but Mark refuses to say anything and leaves, wanting Anna to choose for herself. Anna walks out and Mark confesses his ability to lie. Anna struggles to understand the concept and asks why he did not lie to convince her to marry him; Mark states that it \"wouldn't count\". Anna confesses that she loves him.\n\nSome time later, Anna and Mark are shown happily married with a son, who appears by his actions to have inherited his father's ability to lie.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Ricky Gervais]] as Mark Bellison\n* [[Jennifer Garner]] as Anna McDoogles\n* [[Rob Lowe]] as Brad Kessler\n* [[Louis C.K.]] as Greg Kleinschmidt\n* [[Jonah Hill]] as Frank Fawcett\n* [[Christopher Guest]] as Nathan Goldfrappe\n* [[Tina Fey]] as Shelley Bailey\n* [[Roz Ryan]] as Nurse Barbara\n* [[Jeffrey Tambor]] as Anthony James\n* [[Jimmi Simpson]] as Bob Scott\n* [[Fionnula Flanagan]] as Martha Bellison\n* [[Shaun Williamson]] as Richard Bellison\n* [[Bobby Moynihan]] as Bellison's Assistant\n* [[Dreama Walker]] as Receptionist\n* [[Ashlie Atkinson]] as Bank Teller\n* [[Martin Starr]] as Waiter\n* [[Donald Foley]] as Yelling Man\n* [[John Hodgman]] as Wedding Overseer\n* [[Nate Corddry]] as News Reporter\n* [[Stephanie March]] as Blonde Woman on the Street\n* [[Matthew Robinson (director)|Matthew Robinson]] as Person #4\n* [[Jason Bateman]] as Doctor (cameo)\n* [[Stephen Merchant]] as Man at the Door (cameo)\n* [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]] as Jim The Bartender (cameo)\n* [[Edward Norton]] as Traffic Cop (cameo)\n* [[Karl Pilkington]] as Cave Man (cameo)\n* [[Eric Andre]] as Mansion Man (cameo)\n* [[Donna Sorbello]] as Anna's mother\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development ===\n[[Matthew Robinson (director)|Matthew Robinson]]\u2019s script which was titled ''This Side of Truth'' at the time, was included in 2007 official [[Black List (survey)|Black List]] of the \u201cmost liked\u201d un-produced scripts in Hollywood.<ref name=BlackList>{{cite web |title=2007 Black List |url=https://ed1055efa47d74815ce0-826e8a392aaf48b70eb85d8703df9872.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/2007_black_list.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=The Black List, LLC |quote=10th rank with 10 mentions |accessdate=2018-01-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180107120223/https://ed1055efa47d74815ce0-826e8a392aaf48b70eb85d8703df9872.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/2007_black_list.pdf |archivedate=2018-01-07 }}</ref> Robinson and producer [[Lynda Obst]] sent Ricky Gervais the script out of the blue in the hopes that it would spark his interest. Gervais loved it and eventually flew Robinson to London to retool the script and make the movie. Robinson\u2019s original idea for a feature film grew from a skit he wrote about two people on a date who do not have the ability to lie. He later expanded on the idea for more skits with the same premise and then adapted them it into a full film script.<ref>[http://www.ifc.com/2015/05/15-things-you-probably-didnt-know-about-the-invention-of-lying 15 THINGS WE BET YOU DIDN\u2019T KNOW ABOUT THE INVENTION OF LYING]</ref>\n\nProduction of the film originally used the title ''This Side of the Truth''.<ref name=\"week63\">{{cite web| url=http://rickygervais.com/thissideofthetruthb.php| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321202626/http://www.rickygervais.com/thissideofthetruthb.php| archive-date=2012-03-21| title=Week sixty-three \u2014 April 2009| accessdate=2009-05-08| work=Ricky Gervais...

The film stars Gervais as the first human with the ability to lie in a world where people can only tell the truth. The cast includes [[Jennifer Garner]], [[Jonah Hill]], [[Louis C.K.]], [[Rob Lowe]], and [[Tina Fey]].  The film was released in the United States on October 2, 2009.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film is set in an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternative reality]] in which lying does not exist.\n\nMark Bellison is a [[screenwriter]], in a film industry limited to historical readings because there is no fiction. One night he has a date with the beautiful and [[wealth]]y Anna McDoogles. She tells Mark she is not attracted to him, because of his looks and failing financial situation, but is going out with him as a favor to his best friend, Greg Kleinschmidt.\n\nThe next day, Mark is fired from his job because of the lack of interest in his films (which are set in the lackluster [[14th century]]), and his landlord threatens to evict him for not paying his rent. Crestfallen, he goes to the bank to close his account. The teller informs him that the computers are down and asks him how much money he has in his account. Mark then has an [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]] that enables him to tell the world's first lie, which is that he has $800 \u2014 the amount he owed his landlord \u2014 in his account. He then lies in a variety of other circumstances, initially for personal gain; he prevents a police officer from arresting Greg for [[Driving under the influence|drunk driving]], [[Breaking the bank|breaks the bank]] at a [[casino]], and writes a [[screenplay]] about the world being invaded by aliens in the 14th century that ends with the claim that everyone's memories were erased. He becomes wealthy from the film's success. Mark soon realises that lying can also be used to help others, such as stopping his [[Major depressive disorder|depressive]] neighbour Frank Fawcett from committing [[suicide]]. Soon after, Mark convinces Anna to go out with him again. She congratulates Mark for his financial success and admits that he would be a good husband and father, but she is still not attracted to him due to how his genetics/appearance would not be a good factor in how she wants her child to be/look like.\n\nMark then gets a call that his mother, Martha, has had a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and rushes to the hospital. There, the doctor tells him that Martha is going to die. She is scared of death, believing that it will bring an [[Eternal oblivion|eternity of nothingness]]. Mark, through tears, tells her that death instead brings a joyful [[afterlife]], introducing the concept of a [[Heaven]] to her, and she dies happy. Mark soon receives worldwide attention as the news of his supposed information about death spreads. After encouragement from Anna, he tells the world, through \"ten rules\" (mirroring the [[Ten Commandments]]), that he talks to a \"Man In The Sky\" who controls everything and promises great rewards in the good place after death, as long as you do no more than three \"[[sin|bad things]]\".\n\nSome time later, Anna and Mark are together in a park and Anna asks him, if they marry, if his now being rich and famous would make their children more physically attractive. Mark wants to lie, but does not because of his love for Anna, and says \"No\". Meanwhile, Mark's rival, Brad Kessler, pursues Anna romantically, motivated by his jealousy at Mark's success. Though Brad's selfish and cruel manner makes Anna uncomfortable, she continues dating him and they become engaged. Before the wedding, Greg appears and convinces Mark that he has not missed his chance with Anna. Mark reluctantly attends Anna and Brad's wedding, where he objects to the marriage. The officiant, however, informs him that only the Man in the Sky can stop the wedding. Brad and Anna both ask Mark to ask the Man in the Sky what Anna should do, but Mark refuses to say anything and leaves, wanting Anna to choose for herself. Anna walks out and Mark confesses his ability to lie. Anna struggles to understand the concept and asks why he did not lie to convince her to marry him; Mark states that it \"wouldn't count\". Anna confesses that she loves him.\n\nSome time later, Anna and Mark are shown happily married with a son, who appears by his actions to have inherited his father's ability to lie.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Ricky Gervais]] as Mark Bellison\n* [[Jennifer Garner]] as Anna McDoogles\n* [[Rob Lowe]] as Brad Kessler\n* [[Louis C.K.]] as Greg Kleinschmidt\n* [[Jonah Hill]] as Frank Fawcett\n* [[Christopher Guest]] as Nathan Goldfrappe\n* [[Tina Fey]] as Shelley Bailey\n* [[Roz Ryan]] as Nurse Barbara\n* [[Jeffrey Tambor]] as Anthony James\n* [[Jimmi Simpson]] as Bob Scott\n* [[Fionnula Flanagan]] as Martha Bellison\n* [[Shaun Williamson]] as Richard Bellison\n* [[Bobby Moynihan]] as Bellison's Assistant\n* [[Dreama Walker]] as Receptionist\n* [[Ashlie Atkinson]] as Bank Teller\n* [[Martin Starr]] as Waiter\n* [[Donald Foley]] as Yelling Man\n* [[John Hodgman]] as Wedding Overseer\n* [[Nate Corddry]] as News Reporter\n* [[Stephanie March]] as Blonde Woman on the Street\n* [[Matthew Robinson (director)|Matthew Robinson]] as Person #4\n* [[Jason Bateman]] as Doctor (cameo)\n* [[Stephen Merchant]] as Man at the Door (cameo)\n* [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]] as Jim The Bartender (cameo)\n* [[Edward Norton]] as Traffic Cop (cameo)\n* [[Karl Pilkington]] as Cave Man (cameo)\n* [[Eric Andre]] as Mansion Man (cameo)\n* [[Donna Sorbello]] as Anna's mother\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development ===\n[[Matthew Robinson (director)|Matthew Robinson]]\u2019s script which was titled ''This Side of Truth'' at the time, was included in 2007 official [[Black List (survey)|Black List]] of the \u201cmost liked\u201d un-produced scripts in Hollywood.<ref name=BlackList>{{cite web |title=2007 Black List |url=https://ed1055efa47d74815ce0-826e8a392aaf48b70eb85d8703df9872.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/2007_black_list.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=The Black List, LLC |quote=10th rank with 10 mentions |accessdate=2018-01-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180107120223/https://ed1055efa47d74815ce0-826e8a392aaf48b70eb85d8703df9872.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/2007_black_list.pdf |archivedate=2018-01-07 }}</ref> Robinson and producer [[Lynda Obst]] sent Ricky Gervais the script out of the blue in the hopes that it would spark his interest. Gervais loved it and eventually flew Robinson to London to retool the script and make the movie. Robinson\u2019s original idea for a feature film grew from a skit he wrote about two people on a date who do not have the ability to lie. He later expanded on the idea for more skits with the same premise and then adapted them it into a full film script.<ref>[http://www.ifc.com/2015/05/15-things-you-probably-didnt-know-about-the-invention-of-lying 15 THINGS WE BET YOU DIDN\u2019T KNOW ABOUT THE INVENTION OF LYING]</ref>\n\nProduction of the film originally used the title ''This Side of the Truth''.<ref name=\"week63\">{{cite web| url=http://rickygervais.com/thissideofthetruthb.php| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321202626/http://www.rickygervais.com/thissideofthetruthb.php| archive-date=2012-03-21| title=Week sixty-three \u2014 April 2009| accessdate=2009-05-08| work=Ricky Gervais...

After the show, they were offered several slots as support acts for more established bands all over the world.\n\nIn May 1994, they released their debut [[Extended play|EP]], ''Beware, Poisonous!'' on their own Oxyfactory Records label. The EP was soon reissued by Helen of Oi! Records in October of that year, which led to a full-length album deal.\nWhile recording ''Fuck The Nineties\u2014Here\u2019s Our Noize'', bassist Filzlaus left the band, and was eventually replaced by a friend, Arne. Helen of Oi! Records originally released the album on vinyl in May 1995, and re-released it on CD in the United States in February 1996.\n\nFollowing the release of ''Fuck The Nineties\u2014Here\u2019s Our Noize'', which received great underground reviews, Oxymoron began to tour across Germany as well as in Europe. The band released a split EP with English band Braindance, entitled ''Mohican Melodies'' in September 1995.\nOxymoron released the ''Crisis Identity'' EP in March 1996 on Arne's short-lived Rough Beat Records label, and the band appeared on Helen Of Oi!\u2019s ''Streetpunk Worldwide'' compilation EP in the same year. They also embarked on their first US tour, along the east coast with Braindance and [[The Casualties]]. Also in 1996, Oxymoron made the jump to the German Knock-Out Records label, which released the band's second full-length, ''The Pack Is Back'', in April 1997. The release was followed by more touring in Europe, as well as a three-week summer tour in Japan with The Discocks. Oxymoron established themselves well in the American and German punk scene as an anti-racist streetpunk band.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\nIn 1998, several tours were cancelled, Sucker had to be hospitalized for nerve damage, and Arne decided to leave the band just weeks before they were to head back into the studio. They released a split with [[Dropkick Murphys]] titled ''Irish Stout vs. German Lager''. Chrissy, who temporarily had been a second guitarist and had played bass on the first US tour, stepped in on bass. March 1999 saw the release of the mini-album, ''Westworld'', and was followed by more touring of Europe as well as a seven-week coast-to-coast US tour with Dropkick Murphys and [[The Ducky Boys]]. Chrissy left the band after the tour and was quickly replaced by Morpheus.\n\nIn October 2000, Oxymoron released a compilation album, ''Best Before 2000'', which included all previous 7\u201d singles, along with tracks from previous compilations. November 2001 marked the release of the ''Savage Output'' EP, which included three tracks from their upcoming full-length along and one unreleased track. Their third full-length album, ''Feed The Breed'' was also released in November 2001, and was followed by a six-week coast-to-coast US tour, as well as a European/German tour. \n\nMartin, decided to leave the band, which led to Chrissy stepping in on guitar. They eventually found a replacement guitarist, but he left in the middle of the 2002 US tour. The band's driver, Davey, filled the void for the remainder of the tour, and also on the following European tour.\n\n===Hiatus===\nWhile not announcing an official breakup, Oxymoron has been on an indefinite hiatus since 2002, when Oxymoron announced:  \"In the near future you won't hear much from us. Oxymoron will have a break for a while! We'll let you know what's going on here, but first of all we definitely [need to] take some time off with the band.\" In 2005 they reported that \"the band is still on ice.\" 2006 saw the release of somewhat new material in the ''Noize Overdose'' split EP with Bonecrusher. The EP contained previously unreleased tracks, along with live footage from a 1999 Hamburg, Germany concert. 2006 also marked the release of the first album of Sucker's solo project, Bad Co.

After the show, they were offered several slots as support acts for more established bands all over the world.\n\nIn May 1994, they released their debut [[Extended play|EP]], ''Beware, Poisonous!'' on their own Oxyfactory Records label. The EP was soon reissued by Helen of Oi! Records in October of that year, which led to a full-length album deal.\nWhile recording ''Fuck The Nineties\u2014Here\u2019s Our Noize'', bassist Filzlaus left the band, and was eventually replaced by a friend, Arne. Helen of Oi! Records originally released the album on vinyl in May 1995, and re-released it on CD in the United States in February 1996.\n\nFollowing the release of ''Fuck The Nineties\u2014Here\u2019s Our Noize'', which received great underground reviews, Oxymoron began to tour across Germany as well as in Europe.
