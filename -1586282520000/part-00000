The couple persistently worked hard for their money to ensure that their children had the upbringing and opportunities they themselves had missed out on. Hann and Bich were thrifty and by 2004 were financially stable enough to purchase a \"large\" house with a two-car garage on a residential street in [[Markham, Ontario|Markham]], a town with a large Asian population.<ref name=LauImmigrantDream/> Bich drove a [[Lexus ES 300]] and Hann drove a [[Mercedes-Benz C-Class (W203)]]. They had accumulated [[Canadian dollar|CAD$]]200,000 in savings.<ref name=Revenge/>\n\nJennifer's parents set many goals for their children and had extremely high expectations of them. Jennifer was made to take piano lessons at the age of four, as well as [[figure skating]] classes where she trained most days during the week. She had hopes of becoming an Olympic figure skating champion until she tore a ligament in her knee. Jennifer attended [[Mary Ward Catholic Secondary School]] where she played the [[flute]] in the school band.<ref name=Revenge/> According to her high school friend Karen K. Ho, Hann was seen as \"the classic tiger dad,\" and Bich was \"his reluctant accomplice.\" The Pans picked Jennifer up when classes ended each day and monitored her extracurricular activities very closely. They never permitted her to date boys while attending high school, or to attend high school dances or [[prom]]s out of fear that these activities would distract her from her academic commitments. Jennifer was not permitted to attend any parties while her parents believed that she was attending university. At the age of 22, \"she had never gone to a club, been drunk, visited a friend's cottage or gone on vacation without her family.\"<ref name=Revenge/> Jennifer and her friends reportedly regarded this upbringing as restrictive and greatly oppressive.<ref name=Revenge/>\n\nDespite her parents' high expectations and that Jennifer had received good grades in lower school, throughout high school her grades were somewhat average (in the 70% range) except for music. Multiple times, she forged [[report card]]s using false templates to show her parents that she had received straight As when she had not. When Jennifer failed calculus class in her senior year of high school, [[Ryerson University]] rescinded her early admission. As she could not bear to be perceived as a failure, she began to lie to those she knew, including her parents, and pretended she was attending university. Instead, she sat in caf\u00e9s, taught as a piano instructor and worked in a restaurant to earn money.

Hann and Bich soon became suspicious when they realized she did not have a hospital ID badge or uniform. On one occasion, Bich followed her daughter to \"work\" and quickly discovered her deception. In a state of shock, Hann wanted to throw Jennifer out of the house, but her mother persuaded him to allow her to stay. As she had not completed high school due to failing [[calculus]], she eventually began working to finish high school completely and was later encouraged by her parents to apply to university. She was, however, forbidden to contact Wong or to go anywhere except to her piano-teaching job. Nevertheless, she and Wong spoke clandestinely during this period.<ref name=Revenge/>\n\nBy the time that Jennifer was 24, Wong had grown weary of trying to pursue a relationship with her. As Jennifer was so daunted and restricted by her parents that she lived at home and only met him in secret, Wong began to date another young woman whom he soon fell in love with.<ref name=Revenge/> Pan quickly invented a new story and told Wong that a man had entered her house, showing what appeared to be a police badge. She then told him that several men had rushed in and [[gang-rape]]d her. After this, she insisted that a bullet was mailed to her, telling Wong that it was sent from his new girlfriend.<ref name=Revenge/>\n\n==Murder==\nIn Spring 2010, Pan was in contact with Andrew Montemayor, a high school friend who, she claims, had boasted in their high school years about robbing people at knife point, an assertion denied by Montemayor. Montemayor introduced her to Ricardo Duncan, a \"[[Goth subculture|goth]] kid\" whom Pan gave $1,500 to kill her father in the parking lot at his workplace. Duncan says that she once gave him $200 for a night out, but that he returned it, and that he rebuffed her when she asked him to kill her parents.<ref name=Revenge/>\n\nPan and Wong were back in contact at this time and according to the police, came up with a plan to hire a professional [[hitman]] for $10,000 to kill her parents, calculating that she would then inherit $500,000.

The couple persistently worked hard for their money to ensure that their children had the upbringing and opportunities they themselves had missed out on. Hann and Bich were thrifty and by 2004 were financially stable enough to purchase a \"large\" house with a two-car garage on a residential street in [[Markham, Ontario|Markham]], a town with a large Asian population.<ref name=LauImmigrantDream/> Bich drove a [[Lexus ES 300]] and Hann drove a [[Mercedes-Benz C-Class (W203)]]. They had accumulated [[Canadian dollar|CAD$]]200,000 in savings.<ref name=Revenge/>\n\nJennifer's parents set many goals for their children and had extremely high expectations of them. Jennifer was made to take piano lessons at the age of four, as well as [[figure skating]] classes where she trained most days during the week. She had hopes of becoming an Olympic figure skating champion until she tore a ligament in her knee. Jennifer attended [[Mary Ward Catholic Secondary School]] where she played the [[flute]] in the school band.<ref name=Revenge/> According to her high school friend Karen K. Ho, Hann was seen as \"the classic tiger dad,\" and Bich was \"his reluctant accomplice.\" The Pans picked Jennifer up when classes ended each day and monitored her extracurricular activities very closely. They never permitted her to date boys while attending high school, or to attend high school dances or [[prom]]s out of fear that these activities would distract her from her academic commitments. Jennifer was not permitted to attend any parties while her parents believed that she was attending university. At the age of 22, \"she had never gone to a club, been drunk, visited a friend's cottage or gone on vacation without her family.\"<ref name=Revenge/> Jennifer and her friends reportedly regarded this upbringing as restrictive and greatly oppressive.<ref name=Revenge/>\n\nDespite her parents' high expectations and that Jennifer had received good grades in lower school, throughout high school her grades were somewhat average (in the 70% range) except for music. Multiple times, she forged [[report card]]s using false templates to show her parents that she had received straight As when she had not. When Jennifer failed calculus class in her senior year of high school, [[Ryerson University]] rescinded her early admission. As she could not bear to be perceived as a failure, she began to lie to those she knew, including her parents, and pretended she was attending university. Instead, she sat in caf\u00e9s, taught as a piano instructor and worked in a restaurant to earn money. In order to maintain the charade, Jennifer told her parents she had won scholarships, later falsely claiming that she had accepted an offer into the pharmacology program at the [[University of Toronto]]. She went to the extent of purchasing second-hand textbooks and watching videos related to pharmacology in order to create notebooks full of purported class notes that she could show her parents. Jennifer also requested permission from her parents to stay near the campus with a friend throughout the week.<ref name=Revenge/>\n\nShe was actually staying with her boyfriend,<ref name=Revenge/> Daniel Chi-Kwong Wong,{{#tag:ref|''Daniel Chi-Kwong Wong'': {{zh|first=t,j|t=\u9ec3\u5fd7\u5149|s=\u9ec4\u5fd7\u5149|j=wong4 zi3 gwong1|p=Hu\u00e1ng Zh\u00ecgu\u0101ng|labels=no}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.singtao.ca/toronto/2014-05-10/city1399706077d5044769.html|title=\u7537\u53cb\u7206\u6f58\u5973\u66fe\u906d5\u6f22\u6027\u4fb5 \u8072\u7a31\u6536\u8b66\u544a\u77ed\u8a0a \u77e2\u53e3\u5426\u8a8d\u6d89\u6848|work=[[Sing Tao Daily]]|date=2014-05-10|accessdate=2018-09-18}}</ref>|group=note}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/4th-arrest-in-markham-home-invasion-homicide-1.1038532|agency=[[The Canadian Press]]|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]|title=4th arrest in Markham home invasion homicide|date=2011-04-26|accessdate=2018-09-18}}</ref> a high school sweetheart whom her parents knew nothing about.<ref name=Revenge/><ref name=\"BrownChineseCubs\">{{cite news|last1=Brown|first1=Vanessa|title=When Chinese cubs turn on their Tiger Parents|url=http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/true-stories/when-chinese-cubs-turn-on-their-tiger-parents/news-story/36ad884522b2d22ba1e2f88faa5d72ab|accessdate=9 January 2017|work=News.com.au|date=11 December 2016}}</ref><ref>Grimaldi, {{ISBN|1459735269}}, 9781459735262, [[Google Books]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=zomGCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT31 PT 31]: \"[...]commenting on the fact that he was only half Chinese. \"[...]you're [part] Filipino.\"\"</ref> He was of mixed Chinese and Filipino ancestry,<ref name=\"BrownChineseCubs\">{{cite news|last1=Brown|first1=Vanessa|title=When Chinese cubs turn on their Tiger Parents|url=http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/true-stories/when-chinese-cubs-turn-on-their-tiger-parents/news-story/36ad884522b2d22ba1e2f88faa5d72ab|accessdate=9 January 2017|work=News.com.au|date=11 December 2016}}</ref><ref>Grimaldi, {{ISBN|1459735269}}, 9781459735262, [[Google Books]] [https://books.google.es/books?id=zomGCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT31 PT 31]: \"[...]commenting on the fact that he was only half Chinese. \"[...]you're [part] Filipino.\"\"</ref> resided in [[Ajax, Ontario|Ajax]],<ref name=GillisWendyFifth>{{cite news|author=Gillis, Wendy|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/crime/2011/05/04/fifth_suspect_arrested_in_deadly_markham_home_invasion.html|title=Fifth suspect arrested in deadly Markham home invasion |newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|date=May 4, 2011|accessdate=September 18, 2018}}</ref> and worked at a [[Boston Pizza]] restaurant.<ref name=GrimaldiPT90>Grimaldi, {{ISBN|1459735269}}, 9781459735262, [https://books.google.cz/books?id=zomGCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT90 PT 90]. \"Daniel Wong is arrested at work in front of his colleagues at Boston Pizza on April 26, 2011.\"</ref> Wong, once a student at Mary Ward, transferred to [[Cardinal Carter Academy]] in North York, Toronto due to low grades<!--\"he was falling behind\"-->, and later studied at [[York University]].<ref name=Revenge/> He was an active marijuana dealer.<ref name=Revenge/><!--\"he had been charged with trafficking after cops found half a pound of weed in his car.\"--><ref name=Dimannoastonishing>{{cite news|last=Dimanno|first=Rosie|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/crime/2014/09/15/the_fantastic_testimony_of_jennifer_pan.html|title=The astonishing testimony of Jennifer Pan|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|date=September 15, 2014|accessdate=September 25, 2018|quote=Seven years until Wong \u2014 Pan says he was the one who put her in touch with \u201cHomeboy,\u201d a man he knew through his marijuana dealing}}</ref>\n\n==Adult life==\nWhile pretending to complete her degree at the University of Toronto, Pan told her parents that she had started working as a volunteer at Toronto's [[The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto|Hospital for Sick Children]], known as Sick Kids. Hann and Bich soon became suspicious when they realized she did not have a hospital ID badge or uniform. On one occasion, Bich followed her daughter to \"work\" and quickly discovered her deception. In a state of shock, Hann wanted to throw Jennifer out of the house, but her mother persuaded him to allow her to stay. As she had not completed high school due to failing [[calculus]], she eventually began working to finish high school completely and was later encouraged by her parents to apply to university. She was, however, forbidden to contact Wong or to go anywhere except to her piano-teaching job. Nevertheless, she and Wong spoke clandestinely during this period.<ref name=Revenge/>\n\nBy the time that Jennifer was 24, Wong had grown weary of trying to pursue a relationship with her. As Jennifer was so daunted and restricted by her parents that she lived at home and only met him in secret, Wong began to date another young woman whom he soon fell in love with.<ref name=Revenge/> Pan quickly invented a new story and told Wong that a man had entered her house, showing what appeared to be a police badge. She then told him that several men had rushed in and [[gang-rape]]d her. After this, she insisted that a bullet was mailed to her, telling Wong that it was sent from his new girlfriend.<ref name=Revenge/>\n\n==Murder==\nIn Spring 2010, Pan was in contact with Andrew Montemayor, a high school friend who, she claims, had boasted in their high school years about robbing people at knife point, an assertion denied by Montemayor. Montemayor introduced her to Ricardo Duncan, a \"[[Goth subculture|goth]] kid\" whom Pan gave $1,500 to kill her father in the parking lot at his workplace. Duncan says that she once gave him $200 for a night out, but that he returned it, and that he rebuffed her when she asked him to kill her parents.<ref name=Revenge/>\n\nPan and Wong were back in contact at this time and according to the police, came up with a plan to hire a professional [[hitman]] for $10,000 to kill her parents, calculating that she would then inherit $500,000.

The series is notable for its [[Nonlinear gameplay|open-ended]] gameplay and extensive use of the [[video game console]]'s internal clock and calendar to simulate [[Real time (media)|real passage of time]].\n\nSince its [[Animal Crossing (video game)|initial release]] in 2001, five ''Animal Crossing'' games have been released worldwide, one each for the [[Nintendo 64]]/[[iQue Player]] (enhanced and reissued for the [[GameCube]]), [[Nintendo DS]], [[Wii]], [[Nintendo 3DS]] and [[Nintendo Switch]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.techradar.com/news/animal-crossing-on-nintendo-switch|title=Animal Crossing on Nintendo Switch: release date, news and features|last=Hood|first=Vic|last2=Gaming|first2=Nick Pino 2019-06-18T17:06:19Z|website=TechRadar|language=en|access-date=2019-07-24}}</ref> The series has been both critically and commercially successful and has sold over 30 million units worldwide. Three spin-off games have also been released: ''[[Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer]]'' for [[Nintendo 3DS]], ''[[Animal Crossing: Amiibo Festival]]'' for [[Wii U]], and ''[[Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp]]'' for mobile devices.\n\n== Common elements ==\n\n=== Characters ===\nWhile the series features various villagers for each title, certain prominent characters return in each series installment. [[Tom Nook]] is a [[Japanese raccoon dog|tanuki]] character who functions as both a shop owner and real estate broker, giving the player a loan for their house and allowing them to pay it back with no interest. He is one of the only residents of the town to follow a [[Capitalism|capitalist]] ethos. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/tom-nook-needs-to-get-with-the-times-1829149177|title=Tom Nook Needs To Get With The Times|last=Jackson|first=Gita|website=Kotaku|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-18}}</ref> [[Mr. Resetti]] is a mole character who appears from underground whenever players shut off the game without saving, berating them for circumventing one of the game's systems.

This was seen by some fans as tacit support for [[music piracy]], although Nintendo denied that it was intended as [[social commentary]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/19/technology/social-commentary-or-just-a-dogs-opinion.html|title=Social Commentary, or Just a Dog's Opinion?|last=Jr|first=Tom Zeller|date=2005-12-19|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-08-18|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n===Gameplay===\nIn the ''Animal Crossing'' games, the player assumes the role of a human child, aged between 9-13, who moves into a rural village populated with anthropomorphic animals and lives there indefinitely. Gameplay is [[Nonlinear gameplay|open-ended]]: players have no defined objectives, but are instead encouraged to spend their time in the village performing any number of activities, which include collecting items, planting plants or other items, and socializing with the village's residents. ''Animal Crossing'' games are played in [[Real time (media)|real time]], utilizing the [[video game console]]'s internal clock and calendar. Thus, passage of time in the game world reflects that in reality, as well as the current season and time of day. Some in-game events, such as holidays or the growth of a tree, occur at certain times or require some duration of time to have passed.<ref name=\"IGN_GC_preview\"/>\n\nOne notable feature of the ''Animal Crossing'' series is the high level of customization available, some of which affects the outcome of the game.<ref name=\"IGN_GC_review\" /> The [[player character]] is both named and gendered by the real life player at the start of the game, and their appearance can be modified by buying or designing custom clothes and accessories or changing the hairstyle (introduced in ''[[Animal Crossing: Wild World|Wild World]]''). The player's house can also be furnished, decorated, and later expanded: the player can purchase and collect furniture and place it anywhere in the house, as well as change both the wallpaper and floor designs. While its terrain, building locations, and initial residents are randomly generated when the game is first begun (except in ''Animal Crossing: New Leaf'', in which the player decides between four given towns, and ''Animal Crossing: New Horizons'', in which the player similarly decides between four given islands), the village's name and anthem, as well as some of the residents' catchphrases, are also determined by the player.<ref name=\"IGN_GC_review\"/>\n\nCollecting items is a major facet of ''Animal Crossing'': the player can explore the village and gather objects, including fruit from trees, seashells, and discarded items. Nearly all objects can be sold for Bells, the in-game currency. Players collect objects to obtain more Bells, which can then be used to buy furniture and clothing, purchase home expansions, invest in stocks, and play games. A number of specialized tools are available for other activities such as fishing and insect collecting. Special items, such as fossils and paintings, may be donated to the village museum. The player can choose to socialize with the other animal residents by engaging in conversation, sending and receiving letters, bartering, or playing hide-and-seek. Residents may move in or out of the village depending on the player's actions.\n\nAll installments of ''Animal Crossing'' allow some form of communication between players, both offline and [[Online game|online]]. A single village can house up to four human players, though only one can be exploring the village at any given time.<ref name=\"IGN_GC_preview\">{{cite web| title=Animal Crossing Preview |last=Schneider |first=Peer |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2002/05/30/animal-crossing |date=May 30, 2002 |publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=February 13, 2017}}</ref> The players can interact via written messages through the village post office or bulletin board.

Gameplay is [[Nonlinear gameplay|open-ended]]: players have no defined objectives, but are instead encouraged to spend their time in the village performing any number of activities, which include collecting items, planting plants or other items, and socializing with the village's residents. ''Animal Crossing'' games are played in [[Real time (media)|real time]], utilizing the [[video game console]]'s internal clock and calendar. Thus, passage of time in the game world reflects that in reality, as well as the current season and time of day. Some in-game events, such as holidays or the growth of a tree, occur at certain times or require some duration of time to have passed.<ref name=\"IGN_GC_preview\"/>\n\nOne notable feature of the ''Animal Crossing'' series is the high level of customization available, some of which affects the outcome of the game.<ref name=\"IGN_GC_review\" /> The [[player character]] is both named and gendered by the real life player at the start of the game, and their appearance can be modified by buying or designing custom clothes and accessories or changing the hairstyle (introduced in ''[[Animal Crossing: Wild World|Wild World]]''). The player's house can also be furnished, decorated, and later expanded: the player can purchase and collect furniture and place it anywhere in the house, as well as change both the wallpaper and floor designs. While its terrain, building locations, and initial residents are randomly generated when the game is first begun (except in ''Animal Crossing: New Leaf'', in which the player decides between four given towns, and ''Animal Crossing: New Horizons'', in which the player similarly decides between four given islands), the village's name and anthem, as well as some of the residents' catchphrases, are also determined by the player.<ref name=\"IGN_GC_review\"/>\n\nCollecting items is a major facet of ''Animal Crossing'': the player can explore the village and gather objects, including fruit from trees, seashells, and discarded items. Nearly all objects can be sold for Bells, the in-game currency. Players collect objects to obtain more Bells, which can then be used to buy furniture and clothing, purchase home expansions, invest in stocks, and play games. A number of specialized tools are available for other activities such as fishing and insect collecting. Special items, such as fossils and paintings, may be donated to the village museum.

It is designed for the Linux [[operating system]].  Its original version is produced by [[Heroine Virtual]], there is one active variant produced by the open source community. It is [[free software]] distributed under the [[GNU General Public License]].  Cinelerra also includes a video [[compositing]] engine, allowing the user to perform advanced compositing operations such as [[Keying (graphics)|keying]] and [[Matte (filmmaking)|mattes]], in addition to a title generator, numerous video and audio effects, and many other professional features.\n\nCinelerra was first released August 12, 2002, and was based in part on Broadcast 2000, which was withdrawn by Heroine Virtual in September 2001 <ref>{{citation | url = http://slashdot.org/articles/01/09/10/2016257.shtml | title = Broadcast 2000 Removed From Public Access | publisher = Slashdot | date = 2011-09-10}}{{better source| date= June 2011}}</ref> and archived later.<ref>{{citation | url = https://sourceforge.net/projects/heroines/files/Backups/bcast%20history/ | title = Broadcast 2000 archive}}</ref>\nCinelerra became the first 64-Bit media production application when it was re-written to conform to the [[AMD Opteron]] in June 2003 and was presented at [[SIGGRAPH]] 2004 in San Diego.  This version was subsequently released by Adam Williams of Heroine Warrior, the principal developer of the original Cinelerra. Since then many releases have appeared, both of the original and variants thereof. For a short overview of variants that had more than one release, see the table below.

It is [[Display resolution|resolution]] and [[frame rate]]-independent, meaning that it can support video of any speed and size; this is valid for the HV variant, the GG variant allows up to 8K video. In addition, the GG variant can produce DVDs and Blu-rays.\n\n==Cinelerra interface==\n[[File:Screenshotcin3.png|thumb|400px|border|Cinelerra 2.1 being used to edit footage in a video project]]\nCinelerra's interface is similar to that of other [[Non-linear editing system]]s, such as [[Adobe Premiere Pro]], [[Final Cut Pro]], and [[Avid Media Composer]].  However, because it includes a compositing engine, it may also be likened to compositing software such as [[Adobe After Effects]], Smoke on Linux or [[Shake (software)|Shake]].  The user is by default presented with four windows (clockwise from lower left in picture at right):\n# The ''timeline'', which gives the user a time-based view of all video and audio tracks in the project, as well as [[Keyframing|keyframe]] data for e.g. camera movement, effects, or opacity;\n# the ''viewer'', which gives the user a method of \"scrubbing\" (manually moving the playhead forwards or backwards to locate a specific cue or word) through footage;\n# the ''compositor'', which presents the user with a view of the final project as it would look when rendered. The compositor is interactive in that it allows the user to adjust the positions of video objects; it also updates in response to user input.\n# the ''resource window'', which presents the user with a view of all audio and video resources in the project, as well as available audio and video effects and transitions; and\n\nCinelerra uses its own widget toolkit Guicast (the Cinelerra GUI library), not conforming to the [[human interface guidelines]] of major Linux desktops such as [[GNOME]] and [[KDE]]. This has the advantage that it looks and works the same no matter which distribution or desktop is used, and removes being dependent on a changing version of the desktop (for instance GNOME 2 / GNOME 3].\n\n==Cinelerra usage and awards==\nCinelerra has gained ground among some Linux enthusiasts looking for a native video editing system.  Professional use was mostly promoted by Linux Media Arts, which sold an integrated hardware and software package for video production that includes Cinelerra. However, the company does not seem to be active in the Cinelerra field anymore.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nAt the [[National Association of Broadcasters]]' 2004 Electronic Media Show, Cinelerra received Bob Turner's \"Making the Cut\" award, given to \"the best and most exciting post-production products seen at the convention\".<ref>{{citation|publisher = Primedia Business |url = http://enews.penton.com/enews/videosystems/bob_turners_the_cut/2004_april_28_making_cut_awards/display#cinelerra |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120722020312/http://enews.penton.com/enews/videosystems/bob_turners_the_cut/2004_april_28_making_cut_awards/display#cinelerra |url-status = dead |archive-date = 2012-07-22 | newspaper = eNews | title = The Making The Cut Awards}}.</ref>\n\nIn December 2018 Libre Graphics World included Cinelerra in its comparison of the sustainability of video editors for Linux <ref>{{cite web |last1=Prokoudine |first1=Alexandre |title=The quest for sustainable free/libre non-linear video editors |url=http://libregraphicsworld.org/blog/entry/the-quest-for-sustainable-free-libre-non-linear-video-editors |website=Libre Graphics World |accessdate=2019-09-02}}</ref>\n\n==Cinelerra.org==\nThe project of Michael Collins was following commercial interests (2014 - 2016), aiming at offering professional support to its users. It was organized to merge all existing Cinelerra projects while also providing additional fixes and enhancements. Since early 2015, Cinelerra.org had an open [[Git (software)|Git]] repository on [[Google Code]] for analysis and for input. It released a studio centric version 5.0 of Cinelerra. The goal of Cinelerra.org was to develop a more professional value to the product as of 2016.\n\nAt the present time, Cinelerra.org supports Cinelerra-HV work. Its website links in the download section to both the HV and GG versions.\n\n==Cinelerra-HV==\nHeroine Virtual, the producer of the original Cinelerra, generates a new release of Cinelerra annually, available as source code and a binary for Ubuntu.  Any bugs and usability issues found and resolved by the community that are submitted to Heroine Virtual often result in no immediate response, and it is not until a new release that there is any indication that Heroine Virtual has incorporated these changes. Although it is open source, the source is only made available as complete download for each release. Intermediate access to source files is not possible.\n\nTo distinguish between all different variants of the software, the releases made by Heroine Virtual are also called Cinelerra-HV.<ref>{{citation | url = http://cinelerra-cv.org/about.php | title = About Cinelerra}}.</ref>\n\nA notable feature is that the HV version supports unlimited video sizes, so can be used for very large astronomical images.\n\n==Cinelerra-CV | Cinelerra-CVE==\n\n{{Infobox software\n | name                      = Cinelerra-CV\n | logo                      = [[File:Cinelerra-CV.svg|85px]]\n | developer                 = Cinelerra-CV Community\n | latest_release_version    = 2.3\n | latest_release_date       = {{Start date and age|2015|08|13}}\n | operating_system          = [[Linux]]\n | programming language      = [[C++]]\n | genre                     = [[Video editing software]]\n | license                   = [[GNU General Public License]]\n | website                   = {{URL|https://cinelerra-cv.org}}\n}}\n\nBecause of both the latency in development and the distribution-specific nature of the original Cinelerra from HeroineVirtual, a group of free and open-source software developers created their own version of Cinelerra referred to as Cinelerra-CV (where CV stands for ''community version'').\n\nCinelerra-CV allows the community to contribute to an open repository where changes to the code are accessible to everyone. Mailing lists and an [[IRC]] channel exist where more experienced users and developers can provide support to less experienced users, and developers can hold technical discussions.  Cinelerra-CV is also packaged for a wider range of distributions. It also has a different [[compiler|compilation]] system: system libraries are used extensively, and the [[autoconf]]/[[automake]] tools are used to configure the compilation system.\n\nAlthough Cinelerra-CV may technically be called a [[Fork (software development)|fork]], the relationship between Heroine Virtual and Cinelerra-CV is rather friendly. Heroine Virtual at times contributes to discussions on the mailing lists, and incorporates many of the changes made in the repository.  Heroine Virtual posted the following message on their website describing the relationship:\n\n{{cquote|What you'll find here is the heroinewarrior version of Cinelerra. This is the version that supports what we need to do at Heroine Virtual Ltd. and is the same tree that was started in 1997.  As time passes and new students come and go from the GNU/Linux scene, new forks of Cinelerra emerge that are more suited to the community but not what Heroine Virtual Ltd. needs. Today you'll probably find the cinelerra-cv.org fork more useful.\n\nThey allow certain parts of our fork into their fork while contributing anything they want while we allow certain parts of their fork into our fork while contributing anything we want\".<ref name= \"cinelerra-cv-fork\">{{cite web| publisher = Heroine Warrior | title = Cinelerra-CV fork | url = http://heroinewarrior.com/cinelerra.php3 | accessdate = 2019-01-30}}</ref>}}\n\nUp until Cinelerra 2.1 the versioning of Cinelerra-CV followed that of Heroine Virtual. After Heroine Virtual produced a release, Cinelerra-CV examined the changes introduced by the new version and merged them into their version.  ''CV'' was appended to the end of the version number to indicate the community version. (For example, after the 2.1 merger the CV version was labeled ''2.1CV''.)\nStarting with release 2.2, Cinelerra-CV uses its own versioning scheme, but still merges code from Cinelerra-HV.<ref name= \"cinelerracv-news-archive\">{{cite web | publisher = Cinelerra-CV community | title = Cinelerra-CV news archive | url = https://cinelerra-cv.org/archive/oldnews.php | accessdate = 2019-01-31 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160222190844/http://cinelerra-cv.org/archive/oldnews.php | archive-date = 2016-02-22 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the 26th June 2019, the official web pages were taken offline and the URL redirects to the website for Cinelerra-GG. However, the then CV source code is available at [https://github.com/ratopi/CinelerraCV], the last source update there is from 2018.\n\nThe main Cinelerra-CV developer Einar R\u00fcnkaru works on Cinelerra-CVE, a fork of Cinelerra-CV. \nIt has its own Github page: [https://github.com/vanakala/cinelerra-cve], which shows frequent updates.\n\n==Lumiera rewrite==\n\nIn the beginning of April 2008, the Cinelerra community announced a complete rewrite of the current community version, named as Lumiera{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}. It was born as a rewrite of the Cinelerra codebase called Cinelerra3 but soon was separated into an independent project with its own name. \nThere is no usable application as of March 2019. The project remains in a pre-alpha status of development with a yearly development news update [https://lumiera.org/project/news/news.html Lumiera news]. It has build instructions,<ref>{{citation | url = http://lumiera.org/download.html | title = Build and install Lumiera}}.</ref> and there is a binary Debian/Ubuntu build of the development preview available.<ref>{{citation | url = http://lumiera.org/debian/ | title = Lumiera Debian Depot}}.</ref>\n\nLumiera's native interface is written in [[GTK+]], although other interfaces will be possible.\n\n==Cinelerra-GG Infinity==\n{{Infobox software\n | name                      = Cinelerra-GG Infinity\n | caption                   = Cinelerra-GG Infinity\n | developer                 = Cinelerra-GG community\n | released                  = {{Start date and age|2016|03|31}}\n | latest_release_version    = 2020-03\n | latest_release_date       = {{Start date and age|2020|03|31}}\n | operating_system          = [[Linux]], [[FreeBSD]]\n | programming language      = [[C++]]\n | genre                     = [[Video editing software]]\n | license                   = [[GNU General Public License]], external plug-ins may differ\n | website                   = {{URL|https://cinelerra-gg.org}}\n}}\n\nA separate branch of Cinelerra, Cinelerra-GG (Cin-GG) has integrated the code of Cinelerra-HV from the beginning. Its development has taken place first within the site of cinelerra.org (''Cinelerra 4.6-mod, Cinelerra 5.0''), then within the site of cinelerra-cv.org (''Cinelerra 5.0''), and since March 2016 as a separate branch  within cinelerra-cv.org (''Cinelerra 5.1'') with monthly releases (see [[Cinelerra#Overview|above]]). To avoid confusion between the three branches, this 5.1 branch received the name '-GG' in December 2016, as proposed by the main Cinelerra-CV developer Einar R\u00fcnkaru<ref>{{citation | url = https://lists.cinelerra-cv.org/pipermail/cinelerra/2016q4/005512.html | title = Cinelerra 5.1 branch renamed to GG}}</ref> . In 2016, Cinelerra-GG has integrated the code of Cinelerra-CV, but unlike the CV variant, it reduces reliance on system libraries by including them (like ffmpeg), so it is less dependent on the system's versions of those.\n\nSince December 2018 it has its own website and was renamed from Cinelerra-GG 5.1 to Cinelerra-GG Infinity. Cinelerra-GG is entirely gratis (no costs) and open source (mostly GNU General Public License).\n\nCinelerra-GG is determined to get as close as possible to what can be expected from professional level video editing software (NLE) for the Linux platform.\n\nIt has many features. They include support for recent versions of [[ffmpeg]], Ultra HD up to 8K, two interfaces for audio plug-ins (LADSPA, and LV2 such as Calf Studio Gear), multiple denoisers and motion stabilizers, multi-camera editing, the use of proxies to lighten the workload of a computer, smart folders media filtering, 10-bit color space (10bit + H.265 requires special build), advance trim, live preview of resources, nested clips, shared tracks, group edits, rendering pre-configuration options for YouTube and the ability to save workspace layouts. It supports over 400 video/picture formats for decoding, and over 150 for encoding, including Apple ProRes, AV1, and WEBP. It has a \u00a8Sketcher\" plug-in for free-hand drawing, supports creating HD Blu-ray, and DVDs, and some OpenCV plugins like FindObj. There is support for using a GPU for video decoding and encoding.\n\nIt supports jog-wheels ShuttlePRO V.2 and ShuttleXpress from Contour Design.\n\nLike the other Cinelerra versions (except Lumiera) Cinelerra-GG uses its own GUI. It has 11 GUI themes to cater to user preferences.\n\nThe GG version is under active development, with a stable release at the end of every month. It is supplied as a multi user program pre-packaged for 8 different Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Debian, Arch, OpenSuse, Slackware, Fedora, Centos, Mint), and FreeBSD. When the applicable repository is added to a distribution's update manager, the monthly updates will appear automatically. In addition, there are single-user builds for the 8 Linux distributions plus Gentoo, as tar files. All builds are available in 64 bit, for Debian 9, Slackware and Ubuntu 14 there are also 32 bit single user builds. The source code is available as (manual) monthly download or from the git. As a proof-of-concept, since the 2020-01 release there is a Windows version with limited functionality; for details see the manual's chapter 1.\n\nIn addition to the GG version's monthly releases, it is also available in two Linux variants dedicated to multimedia : [https://www.bandshed.net/avlinux/ AVLinux] and [https://gitlab.com/giuseppetorre/bodhilinuxmedia Bodhi Linux Media].\n\nCinelerra-GG communicates with it users and developers through three platforms: its [https://www.cinelerra-gg.org/forum/ forum] (user oriented), a [https://www.cinelerra-gg.org/bugtracker/my_view_page.php bug tracker] (feature requests, bugs, roadmap), and a [https://lists.cinelerra-gg.org/mailman/listinfo/cin mailing list] (developers discussions). Each monthly release has a significant number of changes resulting from discussions and exchanges of information on these platforms.\n\nCinelerra-GG has an extensive, actively maintained [https://cinelerra-gg.org/download/CinelerraGG_manual.pdf manual], which is also accessible from within the Cinelerra-GG program. The manual is helpful for both beginners (e.g. Quickstart section) and professionals.\n\nThe differences between the GG and other Cinelerra versions can be found in [https://cinelerra-gg.org/download/differences.pdf].\n\n==History of Cinelerra==\nEvents from the original creator Heroine Virtual have been indicated with HV in front of the release number.

It is [[Display resolution|resolution]] and [[frame rate]]-independent, meaning that it can support video of any speed and size; this is valid for the HV variant, the GG variant allows up to 8K video. In addition, the GG variant can produce DVDs and Blu-rays.\n\n==Cinelerra interface==\n[[File:Screenshotcin3.png|thumb|400px|border|Cinelerra 2.1 being used to edit footage in a video project]]\nCinelerra's interface is similar to that of other [[Non-linear editing system]]s, such as [[Adobe Premiere Pro]], [[Final Cut Pro]], and [[Avid Media Composer]].  However, because it includes a compositing engine, it may also be likened to compositing software such as [[Adobe After Effects]], Smoke on Linux or [[Shake (software)|Shake]].  The user is by default presented with four windows (clockwise from lower left in picture at right):\n# The ''timeline'', which gives the user a time-based view of all video and audio tracks in the project, as well as [[Keyframing|keyframe]] data for e.g. camera movement, effects, or opacity;\n# the ''viewer'', which gives the user a method of \"scrubbing\" (manually moving the playhead forwards or backwards to locate a specific cue or word) through footage;\n# the ''compositor'', which presents the user with a view of the final project as it would look when rendered. The compositor is interactive in that it allows the user to adjust the positions of video objects; it also updates in response to user input.\n# the ''resource window'', which presents the user with a view of all audio and video resources in the project, as well as available audio and video effects and transitions; and\n\nCinelerra uses its own widget toolkit Guicast (the Cinelerra GUI library), not conforming to the [[human interface guidelines]] of major Linux desktops such as [[GNOME]] and [[KDE]]. This has the advantage that it looks and works the same no matter which distribution or desktop is used, and removes being dependent on a changing version of the desktop (for instance GNOME 2 / GNOME 3].\n\n==Cinelerra usage and awards==\nCinelerra has gained ground among some Linux enthusiasts looking for a native video editing system.  Professional use was mostly promoted by Linux Media Arts, which sold an integrated hardware and software package for video production that includes Cinelerra. However, the company does not seem to be active in the Cinelerra field anymore.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nAt the [[National Association of Broadcasters]]' 2004 Electronic Media Show, Cinelerra received Bob Turner's \"Making the Cut\" award, given to \"the best and most exciting post-production products seen at the convention\".<ref>{{citation|publisher = Primedia Business |url = http://enews.penton.com/enews/videosystems/bob_turners_the_cut/2004_april_28_making_cut_awards/display#cinelerra |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120722020312/http://enews.penton.com/enews/videosystems/bob_turners_the_cut/2004_april_28_making_cut_awards/display#cinelerra |url-status = dead |archive-date = 2012-07-22 | newspaper = eNews | title = The Making The Cut Awards}}.</ref>\n\nIn December 2018 Libre Graphics World included Cinelerra in its comparison of the sustainability of video editors for Linux <ref>{{cite web |last1=Prokoudine |first1=Alexandre |title=The quest for sustainable free/libre non-linear video editors |url=http://libregraphicsworld.org/blog/entry/the-quest-for-sustainable-free-libre-non-linear-video-editors |website=Libre Graphics World |accessdate=2019-09-02}}</ref>\n\n==Cinelerra.org==\nThe project of Michael Collins was following commercial interests (2014 - 2016), aiming at offering professional support to its users. It was organized to merge all existing Cinelerra projects while also providing additional fixes and enhancements. Since early 2015, Cinelerra.org had an open [[Git (software)|Git]] repository on [[Google Code]] for analysis and for input. It released a studio centric version 5.0 of Cinelerra. The goal of Cinelerra.org was to develop a more professional value to the product as of 2016.\n\nAt the present time, Cinelerra.org supports Cinelerra-HV work. Its website links in the download section to both the HV and GG versions.\n\n==Cinelerra-HV==\nHeroine Virtual, the producer of the original Cinelerra, generates a new release of Cinelerra annually, available as source code and a binary for Ubuntu.  Any bugs and usability issues found and resolved by the community that are submitted to Heroine Virtual often result in no immediate response, and it is not until a new release that there is any indication that Heroine Virtual has incorporated these changes. Although it is open source , the source is only made available as complete download for each release. Intermediate access to source files is not possible.\n\nTo distinguish between all different variants of the software, the releases made by Heroine Virtual are also called Cinelerra-HV.<ref>{{citation | url = http://cinelerra-cv.org/about.php | title = About Cinelerra}}.</ref>\n\nA notable feature is that the HV version supports unlimited video sizes, so can be used for very large astronomical images.\n\n==Cinelerra-CV | Cinelerra-CVE==\n\n{{Infobox software\n | name                      = Cinelerra-CV\n | logo                      = [[File:Cinelerra-CV.svg|85px]]\n | developer                 = Cinelerra-CV Community\n | latest_release_version    = 2.3\n | latest_release_date       = {{Start date and age|2015|08|13}}\n | operating_system          = [[Linux]]\n | programming language      = [[C++]]\n | genre                     = [[Video editing software]]\n | license                   = [[GNU General Public License]]\n | website                   = {{URL|https://cinelerra-cv.org}}\n}}\n\nBecause of both the latency in development and the distribution-specific nature of the original Cinelerra from HeroineVirtual, a group of free and open-source software developers created their own version of Cinelerra referred to as Cinelerra-CV (where CV stands for ''community version'').\n\nCinelerra-CV allows the community to contribute to an open repository where changes to the code are accessible to everyone. Mailing lists and an [[IRC]] channel exist where more experienced users and developers can provide support to less experienced users, and developers can hold technical discussions.  Cinelerra-CV is also packaged for a wider range of distributions. It also has a different [[compiler|compilation]] system: system libraries are used extensively, and the [[autoconf]]/[[automake]] tools are used to configure the compilation system.\n\nAlthough Cinelerra-CV may technically be called a [[Fork (software development)|fork]], the relationship between Heroine Virtual and Cinelerra-CV is rather friendly. Heroine Virtual at times contributes to discussions on the mailing lists, and incorporates many of the changes made in the repository.  Heroine Virtual posted the following message on their website describing the relationship:\n\n{{cquote|What you'll find here is the heroinewarrior version of Cinelerra. This is the version that supports what we need to do at Heroine Virtual Ltd. and is the same tree that was started in 1997.  As time passes and new students come and go from the GNU/Linux scene, new forks of Cinelerra emerge that are more suited to the community but not what Heroine Virtual Ltd. needs. Today you'll probably find the cinelerra-cv.org fork more useful.\n\nThey allow certain parts of our fork into their fork while contributing anything they want while we allow certain parts of their fork into our fork while contributing anything we want\".<ref name= \"cinelerra-cv-fork\">{{cite web| publisher = Heroine Warrior | title = Cinelerra-CV fork | url = http://heroinewarrior.com/cinelerra.php3 | accessdate = 2019-01-30}}</ref>}}\n\nUp until Cinelerra 2.1 the versioning of Cinelerra-CV followed that of Heroine Virtual. After Heroine Virtual produced a release, Cinelerra-CV examined the changes introduced by the new version and merged them into their version.  ''CV'' was appended to the end of the version number to indicate the community version. (For example, after the 2.1 merger the CV version was labeled ''2.1CV''.)\nStarting with release 2.2, Cinelerra-CV uses its own versioning scheme, but still merges code from Cinelerra-HV.<ref name= \"cinelerracv-news-archive\">{{cite web | publisher = Cinelerra-CV community | title = Cinelerra-CV news archive | url = https://cinelerra-cv.org/archive/oldnews.php | accessdate = 2019-01-31 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160222190844/http://cinelerra-cv.org/archive/oldnews.php | archive-date = 2016-02-22 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the 26th June 2019, the official web pages were taken offline and the URL redirects to the website for Cinelerra-GG. However, the then CV source code is available at [https://github.com/ratopi/CinelerraCV], the last source update there is from 2018.\n\nThe main Cinelerra-CV developer Einar R\u00fcnkaru works on Cinelerra-CVE, a fork of Cinelerra-CV. \nIt has its own Github page: [https://github.com/vanakala/cinelerra-cve], which shows frequent updates.\n\n==Lumiera rewrite==\n\nIn the beginning of April 2008, the Cinelerra community announced a complete rewrite of the current community version, named as Lumiera{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}. It was born as a rewrite of the Cinelerra codebase called Cinelerra3 but soon was separated into an independent project with its own name. \nThere is no usable application as of March 2019. The project remains in a pre-alpha status of development with a yearly development news update [https://lumiera.org/project/news/news.html Lumiera news]. It has build instructions,<ref>{{citation | url = http://lumiera.org/download.html | title = Build and install Lumiera}}.</ref> and there is a binary Debian/Ubuntu build of the development preview available.<ref>{{citation | url = http://lumiera.org/debian/ | title = Lumiera Debian Depot}}.</ref>\n\nLumiera\u2019s native interface is written in [[GTK+]], although other interfaces will be possible.\n\n==Cinelerra-GG Infinity==\n{{Infobox software\n | name                      = Cinelerra-GG Infinity\n | caption                   = Cinelerra-GG Infinity\n | developer                 = Cinelerra-GG community\n | released                  = {{Start date and age|2016|03|31}}\n | latest_release_version    = 2020-03\n | latest_release_date       = {{Start date and age|2020|03|31}}\n | operating_system          = [[Linux]], [[FreeBSD]]\n | programming language      = [[C++]]\n | genre                     = [[Video editing software]]\n | license                   = [[GNU General Public License]], external plug-ins may differ\n | website                   = {{URL|https://cinelerra-gg.org}}\n}}\n\nA separate branch of Cinelerra, Cinelerra-GG (Cin-GG) has integrated the code of Cinelerra-HV from the beginning. Its development has taken place first within the site of cinelerra.org (''Cinelerra 4.6-mod, Cinelerra 5.0''), then within the site of cinelerra-cv.org (''Cinelerra 5.0''), and since March 2016 as a separate branch  within cinelerra-cv.org (''Cinelerra 5.1'') with monthly releases (see [[Cinelerra#Overview|above]]). To avoid confusion between the three branches, this 5.1 branch received the name '-GG' in December 2016, as proposed by the main Cinelerra-CV developer Einar R\u00fcnkaru<ref>{{citation | url = https://lists.cinelerra-cv.org/pipermail/cinelerra/2016q4/005512.html | title = Cinelerra 5.1 branch renamed to GG}}</ref> . In 2016, Cinelerra-GG has integrated the code of Cinelerra-CV, but unlike the CV variant, it reduces reliance on system libraries by including them (like ffmpeg), so it is less dependent on the system's versions of those.\n\nSince December 2018 it has its own website and was renamed from Cinelerra-GG 5.1 to Cinelerra-GG Infinity. Cinelerra-GG is entirely gratis (no costs) and open source (mostly GNU General Public License).\n\nCinelerra-GG is determined to get as close as possible to what can be expected from professional level video editing software (NLE) for the Linux platform.\n\nIt has many features. They include support for recent versions of [[ffmpeg]], Ultra HD up to 8K, two interfaces for audio plug-ins (LADSPA, and LV2 such as Calf Studio Gear), multiple denoisers and motion stabilizers, multi-camera editing, the use of proxies to lighten the workload of a computer, smart folders media filtering, 10-bit color space (10bit + H.265 requires special build), advance trim, live preview of resources, nested clips, shared tracks, group edits, rendering pre-configuration options for YouTube and the ability to save workspace layouts. It supports over 400 video/picture formats for decoding, and over 150 for encoding, including Apple ProRes, AV1, and WEBP. It has a \u00a8Sketcher\" plug-in for free-hand drawing, supports creating HD Blu-ray, and DVDs, and some OpenCV plugins like FindObj. There is support for using a GPU for video decoding and encoding.\n\nIt supports jog-wheels ShuttlePRO V.2 and ShuttleXpress from Contour Design.\n\nLike the other Cinelerra versions (except Lumiera) Cinelerra-GG uses its own GUI. It has 11 GUI themes to cater to user preferences.\n\nThe GG version is under active development, with a stable release at the end of every month. It is supplied as a multi user program pre-packaged for 8 different Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Debian, Arch, OpenSuse, Slackware, Fedora, Centos, Mint), and FreeBSD. When the applicable repository is added to a distribution\u00b4s update manager, the monthly updates will appear automatically. In addition, there are single-user builds for the 8 Linux distributions plus Gentoo, as tar files. All builds are available in 64 bit, for Debian 9, Slackware and Ubuntu 14 there are also 32 bit single user builds. The source code is available as (manual) monthly download or from the git. As a proof-of-concept, since the 2020-01 release there is a Windows version with limited functionality; for details see the manual's chapter 1.\n\nIn addition to the GG version\u00b4s monthly releases, it is also available in two Linux variants dedicated to multimedia : [https://www.bandshed.net/avlinux/ AVLinux] and [https://gitlab.com/giuseppetorre/bodhilinuxmedia Bodhi Linux Media].\n\nCinelerra-GG communicates with it users and developers through three platforms: its [https://www.cinelerra-gg.org/forum/ forum] (user oriented), a [https://www.cinelerra-gg.org/bugtracker/my_view_page.php bug tracker] (feature requests, bugs, roadmap), and a [https://lists.cinelerra-gg.org/mailman/listinfo/cin mailing list] (developers discussions). Each monthly release has a significant number of changes resulting from discussions and exchanges of information on these platforms.\n\nCinelerra-GG has an extensive, actively maintained [https://cinelerra-gg.org/download/CinelerraGG_manual.pdf manual], which is also accessible from within the Cinelerra-GG program. The manual is helpful for both beginners (e.g. Quickstart section) and professionals.\n\nThe differences between the GG and other Cinelerra versions can be found in [https://cinelerra-gg.org/download/differences.pdf].\n\n==History of Cinelerra==\nEvents from the original creator Heroine Virtual have been indicated with HV in front of the release number.
