The motion picture was directed by the [[Farrelly brothers]] and filmed in and around [[Charlotte]] as well as [[Sterling, Massachusetts|Sterling]] and [[Princeton, Massachusetts]] at [[Mount Wachusett|Wachusett Mountain]].{{cn|date=May 2017}} The supporting cast features [[Jason Alexander]], [[Tony Robbins]] (as himself), and [[Laura Kightlinger]]. The film's score was composed by William Goodrum, [[Ivy (band)|Ivy]] and [[Cliff Eidelman]].\n\n== Plot ==\nHal Larson ([[Jack Black]]) is a superficial man whose fixation on the physical beauty of women gets in the way of seeing their inner beauty. Hal and his equally shallow friend, Mauricio ([[Jason Alexander]]), spend their nights obnoxiously hitting on beautiful, sexy women at nightclubs and mostly they end up getting rejected. Hal's work life is steady, but he is dismayed after being passed over for a long-sought promotion. His love life is non-existent, as seen when he tries to ask Jill ([[Susan Ward]]), his attractive neighbor, out for a date. Jill is not interested as she finds Hal too shallow.\n\nHal becomes trapped in an elevator with life coach [[Tony Robbins]]. While waiting for the elevator to be fixed, Robbins sympathizes with Hal's disappointment but tries to figure out his ideas about women. He [[hypnosis|hypnotizes]] Hal into only seeing a person's inner beauty. Hal does not realize he's been hypnotized and later meets Rosemary ([[Gwyneth Paltrow]]), daughter of the president of the company where he is employed. Rosemary is [[morbidly obese]], but Hal sees a slender and beautiful [[trophy wife|trophy blonde]].  He is immediately smitten by her. Used to being overlooked due to her appearance, Rosemary initially interprets Hal's interest as mockery, but begins to realize his feelings for her are sincere. They begin to date, which includes a bike ride with Hal's friend Walt ([[Rene Kirby]]), who has [[spina bifida]].\n\nMauricio, worried about Hal's new taste in women, convinces Robbins to give him the trigger phrase to undo the hypnosis, which is \"Shallow Hal wants a gal\". While on a date in a restaurant, Rosemary tells Hal she's been asked by the Peace Corps to go on a 14-month mission in [[Kiribati]]. Mauricio phones Hal and says the trigger phrase, breaking Hal's hypnosis. Mauricio confesses to Hal the truth about Robbins' [[hypnotherapy]], but Hal does not believe it until he runs into a woman who initially appeared beautiful to him but whom Hal now sees in her true, physically unattractive state.\n\nHal begins to avoid Rosemary, who becomes depressed without him around. Distraught that he was not seeing the \"real\" Rosemary, Hal accepts a dinner invitation from Jill. The two dine together and Jill tells Hal that she has observed him overcoming his shallow nature and is interested in dating him now.\n\nHal realizes his true feelings for Rosemary who has, coincidentally, arrived at the same restaurant with her family and sees Hal and Jill sitting together. Assuming the worst, Rosemary leaves in tears. Not recognizing Rosemary, Hal walks right by her on his way to a payphone to call her and reassure her of his feelings. Confused and distraught, Rosemary calls Hal a \"psycho\" over the phone and effectively breaks up with him.\n\nFive days later, Steve informs Hal that Rosemary\u2019s [[Peace Corps]] partner, Ralph, wants to be in a relationship with her again. Hal attempts to find Rosemary, but instead encounters a young patient named Cadence at the hospital where Rosemary volunteers. Previously, due to Robbins' hypnosis, Hal saw Cadence as a perfect little girl; he now sees that there are severe burns all over Cadence's face. Inspired by Cadence, Hal changes his views on the physical appearances of people in general.\n\nHal, during his search for Rosemary, finds that Mauricio had his own reason for stopping Hal's hypnosis: He has an inoperable [[vestigial tail]], which has prevented him from ever getting close to a woman. Mauricio confesses he was envious of Hal's happiness and is afraid to start a relationship with a woman. Hal convinces Mauricio to accept his abnormality, with confidence.\n\nHal makes up with Mauricio and decides to reconcile with Rosemary. He heads to the Peace Corps recruiting office and confronts Ralph, believing he and Rosemary got back together. Ralph informs Hal that he and Rosemary are not together and that Rosemary's parents are throwing her a farewell party (and Ralph wasn't invited). Hal, Mauricio, Ralph and Ralph's friend Li\u2019iBoy arrive at the home of Rosemary's parents. Rosemary initially rebuffs Hal's presence, but then accepts his apology when Hal professes his love for her. Rosemary informs Hal she is still leaving on her Peace Corps mission. Hal says he is coming, too, having just been sworn into the Peace Corps by Li\u2019iBoy.\n\nHal and Rosemary reconcile, cheered by the crowd as they kiss. He tries to carry her bridal-style to the car, but finds he cannot lift her. Moved by his gesture and effort, she triumphantly carries him instead. As they drive off, Mauricio meets a woman who loves dogs and the two walk off together as he wags his \"tail\".\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Jack Black]] as Hal Larson\n* [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] as Rosemary \"Rose\" Shanahan\n* [[Jason Alexander]] as Mauricio Wilson\n* [[Joe Viterelli]] as Steve Shanahan\n* [[Jill Christine Fitzgerald]] as Mrs. Shanahan\n* [[Tony Robbins]] as Himself\n* [[Bruce McGill]] as Reverend Larson\n* [[Molly Shannon]] as Mrs. Mary Larson (uncredited)\n* [[Sasha Neulinger]] as young Hal\n* [[Susan Ward]] as Jill\n* [[Rene Kirby]] as Walt\n* [[Kyle Gass]] as Artie\n* [[Laura Kightlinger]] as Jen\n* [[Brooke Burns]] as Katrina\n* [[Sayed Badreya]] as Dr. Sayed\n* [[Nan Martin]] as Nurse Peeler\n* [[Zen Gesner]] as Ralph\n* [[Ron Darling]] as attractive Li'iBoy\n* [[Joshua Shintani]] as overweight Li'iBoy\n* [[Sascha Knopf]] as attractive Tanya\n* [[Nan Martin]] as unattractive Tanya\n* [[Mary Wigmore]] as attractive Tiffany\n* [[Rob Moran]] as unattractive Tiffany\n* [[Michael Corrente]] as homeless man #2\n* [[Leslie DeAntonio]] as Helga the maid\n* Manon von Gerkan as Lindy\n* [[Brianna Gardner]] as Cadence\n* [[Kulman P.

''Shallow Hal'' was a more emotional movie and the producers spent a lot of time trying to ensure it would not be portrayed as a mere \"fat joke\" type of movie, but one that has a strong message associated with it.\n\n[[Gwyneth Paltrow]] played both roles, slim and fat Rosemary (except for a couple of close-up shots of fat Rosemary below the neck, which were played by her body double Ivy Snitzer), and had to wear a specially designed 25-pound [[fatsuit]] and encapsulating prosthetic make-up. She has since admitted that she did not enjoy partaking in production of the movie, in particular dreading having to wear the fat suit and makeup. The prosthetic make-up effects and body suits for Rosemary, Rosemary's mother, and all of the secondary characters were designed and created by [[Tony Gardner (designer)|Tony Gardner]] and his company [[Alterian, Inc.]]\n\n==Reception==\n{{anchor|Box office}}\n===Box office===\nIn its opening weekend at the U.S. box office, ''Shallow Hal'' grossed $22.5 million, opening at #2 behind ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]''.

The motion picture was directed by the [[Farrelly brothers]] and filmed in and around [[Charlotte]] as well as [[Sterling, Massachusetts|Sterling]] and [[Princeton, Massachusetts]] at [[Mount Wachusett|Wachusett Mountain]].{{cn|date=May 2017}} The supporting cast features [[Jason Alexander]], [[Tony Robbins]] (as himself), and [[Laura Kightlinger]]. The film's score was composed by William Goodrum, [[Ivy (band)|Ivy]] and [[Cliff Eidelman]].\n\n== Plot ==\nHal Larson ([[Jack Black]]) is a superficial man whose fixation on the physical beauty of women gets in the way of seeing their inner beauty. Hal and his equally shallow friend, Mauricio ([[Jason Alexander]]), spend their nights obnoxiously hitting on beautiful, sexy women at nightclubs and mostly they end up getting rejected. Hal's work life is steady, but he is dismayed after being passed over for a long-sought promotion. His love life is non-existent, as seen when he tries to ask Jill ([[Susan Ward]]), his attractive neighbor, out for a date. Jill is not interested as she finds Hal too shallow.\n\nHal becomes trapped in an elevator with life coach [[Tony Robbins]]. While waiting for the elevator to be fixed, Robbins sympathizes with Hal's disappointment but tries to figure out his ideas about women. He [[hypnosis|hypnotizes]] Hal into only seeing a person's inner beauty. Hal does not realize he's been hypnotized and later meets Rosemary ([[Gwyneth Paltrow]]), daughter of the president of the company where he is employed. Rosemary is [[morbidly obese]], but Hal sees a slender and beautiful [[trophy wife|trophy blonde]].  He is immediately smitten by her. Used to being overlooked due to her appearance, Rosemary initially interprets Hal's interest as mockery, but begins to realize his feelings for her are sincere. They begin to date, which includes a bike ride with Hal's friend Walt ([[Rene Kirby]]), who has [[spina bifida]].\n\nMauricio, worried about Hal's new taste in women, convinces Robbins to give him the trigger phrase to undo the hypnosis, which is \"Shallow Hal wants a gal\". While on a date in a restaurant, Rosemary tells Hal she's been asked by the Peace Corps to go on a 14-month mission in [[Kiribati]]. Mauricio phones Hal and says the trigger phrase, breaking Hal's hypnosis. Mauricio confesses to Hal the truth about Robbins' [[hypnotherapy]], but Hal does not believe it until he runs into a woman who initially appeared beautiful to him but whom Hal now sees in her true, physically unattractive state.\n\nHal begins to avoid Rosemary, who becomes depressed without him around. Distraught that he was not seeing the \"real\" Rosemary, Hal accepts a dinner invitation from Jill. The two dine together and Jill tells Hal that she has observed him overcoming his shallow nature and is interested in dating him now.\n\nHal realizes his true feelings for Rosemary who has, coincidentally, arrived at the same restaurant with her family and sees Hal and Jill sitting together. Assuming the worst, Rosemary leaves in tears. Not recognizing Rosemary, Hal walks right by her on his way to a payphone to call her and reassure her of his feelings. Confused and distraught, Rosemary calls Hal a \"psycho\" over the phone and effectively breaks up with him.\n\nFive days later, Steve informs Hal that Rosemary\u2019s [[Peace Corps]] partner, Ralph, wants to be in a relationship with her again. Hal attempts to find Rosemary, but instead encounters a young patient named Cadence at the hospital where Rosemary volunteers. Previously, due to Robbins' hypnosis, Hal saw Cadence as a perfect little girl; he now sees that there are severe burns all over Cadence's face. Inspired by Cadence, Hal changes his views on the physical appearances of people in general.\n\nHal, during his search for Rosemary, finds that Mauricio had his own reason for stopping Hal's hypnosis: He has an inoperable [[vestigial tail]], which has prevented him from ever getting close to a woman. Mauricio confesses he was envious of Hal's happiness and is afraid to start a relationship with a woman. Hal convinces Mauricio to accept his abnormality, with confidence.\n\nHal makes up with Mauricio and decides to reconcile with Rosemary. He heads to the Peace Corps recruiting office and confronts Ralph, believing he and Rosemary got back together. Ralph informs Hal that he and Rosemary are not together and that Rosemary's parents are throwing her a farewell party (and Ralph wasn't invited). Hal, Mauricio, Ralph and Ralph's friend Li\u2019iBoy arrive at the home of Rosemary's parents. Rosemary initially rebuffs Hal's presence, but then accepts his apology when Hal professes his love for her. Rosemary informs Hal she is still leaving on her Peace Corps mission. Hal says he is coming, too, having just been sworn into the Peace Corps by Li\u2019iBoy.\n\nHal and Rosemary reconcile, cheered by the crowd as they kiss. He tries to carry her bridal-style to the car, but finds he cannot lift her. Moved by his gesture and effort, she triumphantly carries him instead. As they drive off, Mauricio meets a woman who loves dogs and the two walk off together as he wags his \"tail\".\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Jack Black]] as Hal Larson\n* [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] as Rosemary \"Rose\" Shanahan\n* [[Jason Alexander]] as Mauricio Wilson\n* [[Joe Viterelli]] as Steve Shanahan\n* [[Jill Christine Fitzgerald]] as Mrs. Shanahan\n* [[Tony Robbins]] as Himself\n* [[Bruce McGill]] as Reverend Larson\n* [[Molly Shannon]] as Mrs. Mary Larson (uncredited)\n* [[Sasha Neulinger]] as young Hal\n* [[Susan Ward]] as Jill\n* [[Rene Kirby]] as Walt\n* [[Kyle Gass]] as Artie\n* [[Laura Kightlinger]] as Jen\n* [[Brooke Burns]] as Katrina\n* [[Sayed Badreya]] as Dr. Sayed\n* [[Nan Martin]] as Nurse Peeler\n* [[Zen Gesner]] as Ralph\n* [[Ron Darling]] as attractive Li'iBoy\n* [[Joshua Shintani]] as overweight Li'iBoy\n* [[Sascha Knopf]] as attractive Tanya\n* [[Nan Martin]] as unattractive Tanya\n* [[Mary Wigmore]] as attractive Tiffany\n* [[Rob Moran]] as unattractive Tiffany\n* [[Michael Corrente]] as homeless man #2\n* [[Leslie DeAntonio]] as Helga the maid\n* Manon von Gerkan as Lindy\n* [[Brianna Gardner]] as Cadence\n* [[Kulman P.

''Shallow Hal'' was a more emotional movie and the producers spent a lot of time trying to ensure it would not be portrayed as a mere \"fat joke\" type of movie, but one that has a strong message associated with it.\n\n[[Gwyneth Paltrow]] played both roles, slim and fat Rosemary (except for a couple of close-up shots of fat Rosemary below the neck, which were played by her body double Ivy Snitzer), and had to wear a specially designed 25-pound [[fatsuit]] and encapsulating prosthetic make-up. She has since admitted that she did not enjoy partaking in production of the movie, in particular dreading having to wear the fat suit and makeup. The prosthetic make-up effects and body suits for Rosemary, Rosemary's mother, and all of the secondary characters were designed and created by [[Tony Gardner (designer)|Tony Gardner]] and his company [[Alterian, Inc.]]\n\n==Reception==\n{{anchor|Box office}}\n===Box office===\nIn its opening weekend at the U.S. box office, ''Shallow Hal'' grossed $22.5 million, opening at #2 behind ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]''.

Outgoing and sociable Walt aspires to be a [[Hollywood]] actor, however, whereas shy, introverted Bob prefers the quiet life. They run Quikee Burger, a diner in [[Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts|Oak Bluffs]] on [[Martha's Vineyard]], that guarantees free meals to customers whose orders are not completed in three minutes, a testament to how skilled and in sync Bob and Walt are with each other. Though Walt is comfortable socializing with women, Bob is the shyer of the two, and carries on a long-distance relationship with a pen pal named May Fong whom he has never met in person, and who is unaware that they are conjoined twins.\n\nWalt gets a role in a local play. Bob stays as much as possible in the background, as he has a tendency to get [[stage fright]]. Following the play's success, Walt decides to follow his dream to Hollywood and persuades his hesitant brother to go along for the ride.\nThey rent an apartment in California and become friends with fellow aspiring actress April Mercedes. When she expresses curiosity about their conjoinment, Walt explains that they share a [[liver]] that is mostly Bob's, and that because surgical separation entails risk to Walt, Bob would not consent to the surgery, even though Walt favored it. It is also the reason why Walt appears somewhat older than Bob. (Greg Kinnear is seven years older than Matt Damon in real life.)\n\nWalt's efforts to find acting work in Hollywood are fraught with difficulty, and his agent, Morty O'Reilly, is little help, offering at one point to get him a job in a pornographic film. [[Cher]] is upset that she has ended up starring in a prime-time TV show called ''Honey and the Beaze''. She wants out of the deal, so she decides to hire Walt as her co-star (since her contract states she can choose anyone she wants), certain the show will get cancelled. The producers, realizing Cher's scheme, foil it by going forward with the production, compensating for Bob's presence by keeping him out of the camera frame and employing [[Chroma key|bluescreen]] effects. The show is a surprise hit and Walt becomes famous.\n\nWalt arranges for May Fong to come to California. Although he did this without Bob's consent, Bob and May Fong develop a romantic relationship, though the twins' attempt to keep their conjoined nature a secret proves challenging, especially since Walt must accompany the new couple everywhere, sometimes using creative solutions like disguising himself as a giant teddy bear.

Outgoing and sociable Walt aspires to be a [[Hollywood]] actor, however, whereas shy, introverted Bob prefers the quiet life. They run Quikee Burger, a diner in [[Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts|Oak Bluffs]] on [[Martha's Vineyard]], that guarantees free meals to customers whose orders are not completed in three minutes, a testament to how skilled and in sync Bob and Walt are with each other. Though Walt is comfortable socializing with women, Bob is the shyer of the two, and carries on a long-distance relationship with a pen pal named May Fong whom he has never met in person, and who is unaware that they are conjoined twins.\n\nWalt gets a role in a local play. Bob stays as much as possible in the background, as he has a tendency to get [[stage fright]]. Following the play's success, Walt decides to follow his dream to Hollywood and persuades his hesitant brother to go along for the ride.\nThey rent an apartment in California and become friends with fellow aspiring actress April Mercedes. When she expresses curiosity about their conjoinment, Walt explains that they share a [[liver]] that is mostly Bob's, and that because surgical separation entails risk to Walt, Bob would not consent to the surgery, even though Walt favored it. It is also the reason why Walt appears somewhat older than Bob. (Greg Kinnear is seven years older than Matt Damon in real life.)\n\nWalt's efforts to find acting work in Hollywood are fraught with difficulty, and his agent, Morty O'Reilly, is little help, offering at one point to get him a job in a pornographic film. [[Cher]] is upset that she has ended up starring in a prime-time TV show called ''Honey and the Beaze''. She wants out of the deal, so she decides to hire Walt as her co-star (since her contract states she can choose anyone she wants), certain the show will get cancelled. The producers, realizing Cher's scheme, foil it by going forward with the production, compensating for Bob's presence by keeping him out of the camera frame and employing [[Chroma key|bluescreen]] effects. The show is a surprise hit and Walt becomes famous.\n\nWalt arranges for May Fong to come to California. Although he did this without Bob's consent, Bob and May Fong develop a romantic relationship, though the twins' attempt to keep their conjoined nature a secret proves challenging, especially since Walt must accompany the new couple everywhere, sometimes using creative solutions like disguising himself as a giant teddy bear. Eventually however, when May discovers the twins in bed, she concludes that they are a homosexual couple rather than brothers. Although Bob shows May that they are indeed conjoined twins, May is nonetheless in even greater shock at the deception, and flees.\n\nMorty informs the twins that word has leaked about Walt and Bob being conjoined. Rather than hide this, the twins decide to embrace it, and they both become huge celebrities, making commercials and appearing on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]''. While Walt enjoys this success, he knows that Bob is unhappy because he misses May. Resolving that Bob needs to be independent from him in order to be happy, Walt demands they be surgically separated.  When Bob refuses, Walt, determined to convince him, begins acting wild and crazy until Bob can no longer take it. Walt starts to make a fool of himself by getting drunk and accidentally snatching a woman's purse. They eventually end up spending the night in jail for drunk driving; even though Walt was drinking, Bob is the one who suffers the hangover since their shared liver is mostly his. When they are released the following morning, they get into a fight and Bob decides to go with the operation.\n\nOn the night before the surgery, May shows up and apologizes to Bob for running out the way she did.
