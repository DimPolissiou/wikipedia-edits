Sitka also receives circulation of the ''[[Capital City Weekly]]'' \u2014 a weekly regional newspaper based out of Juneau.\n\nAlaska's first newspaper following the Alaska purchase, the ''Sitka Times'', was published by Barney O. Ragan on September 19, 1868. Only four issues were published that year, as Ragan cited a lack of resources available at the time. The paper resumed publishing the following year as the ''Alaska Times''. In 1870, it moved to [[Seattle]], where the year following it was renamed the ''Seattle Times'' (not to be confused with [[Seattle Times|the modern-day newspaper of the same name]]).<ref>{{cite book |title=Guide to Alaska Newspapers on Microfilm |url=http://www.library.state.ak.us/hist/hist_docs/newspapers/by_place.pdf |format=PDF |year=1998 |publisher=[[Alaska State Library]] |location=Juneau |pages=324, 332 |access-date=2011-10-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128014232/http://www.library.state.ak.us/hist/hist_docs/newspapers/by_place.pdf |archive-date=2007-11-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Radio===\nSitka has three radio stations, public radio station [[KCAW]] (Raven Radio), and commercial radio stations [[KIFW]], and [[KSBZ]].\n\n===Television===\n[[KTNL-TV]] (CBS) broadcasts out of Sitka on Channel 13 (Cable 6) serving Southeast Alaska.

Vehicles are usually brought to Sitka via the [[Alaska Marine Highway]] ferry system. However, a vehicle is not an absolute necessity in Sitka, as there are only {{convert|14|mi|abbr=off}} of road from one end of the island to another. Most everything is within walking distance from the downtown area which is where the majority of employers are situated. Public transportation is also available.\n\nBy air, [[Sitka Rocky Gutierrez Airport]] offers scheduled passenger jet service operated year-round by [[Alaska Airlines]] and seasonally by [[Delta Connection]] as well as commuter, charter, and bush air service provided by Harris Aircraft Services.  Harris Air provides scheduled service to several smaller communities in the southeast as well as to Juneau.\n\nDelays in fall and winter due to Sitka's weather are frequent. The airport is located on Japonski Island, which is connected to Baranof Island by the [[John O'Connell Bridge|O'Connell Bridge]]. The O'Connell Bridge, completed in 1972, was the first vehicular [[cable-stayed bridge]] in the United States. The [[Sitka Seaplane Base]] is [[seaplane]] landing area situated in the [[Sitka Channel]], adjacent to the airport.\n\nFerry travel back and forth to Juneau, Ketchikan and other towns in Southeast Alaska is provided through the [[Alaska Marine Highway System]]. The ferry terminal is located {{convert|7|mi|km}} north of downtown and a ferry ticket costs about $49 per person each way to Juneau (as of July 2013). Vehicles, pets and bicycles can also be taken on the ferry for an additional charge.\n\nSitka's location on the outer coast of the Alaska Panhandle is removed from routes run through [[Chatham Strait]]. This, in addition to the tides of [[Peril Strait]]s that allow mainline vessels through only at slack tide combine to result in no designated service by a vessel and minimal service overall. However, the AMHS is often the mode of transportation of choice when the schedule proves convenient because of its much cheaper cost.\n\nAlaska Marine Lines, a barge and freight company, has the ability to move cars to other communities connected to the mainland by road systems.\n\nA three-way partnership of non-profits (Center for Community, [[Sitka Tribe of Alaska]], and Southeast Senior Services) offers public bus transit, funded by the [[Federal Transit Administration]] and the [[Alaska Department of Transportation]]. All buses are fully accessible, with service from 6:30&nbsp;a.m. to 7:30&nbsp;p.m., Monday through Friday.\n\nIn 2008, the [[League of American Bicyclists]] awarded Sitka the bronze level in bicycle friendliness making Sitka the first [[League of American Bicyclists#Bicycle Friendly Communities|bicycle-friendly community]] in Alaska.

Sitka is the only Alaska community to have both a Bicycle Friendly Community and a Walk Friendly Communities designation.\n\n===Healthcare===\nThere are two hospitals in Sitka:\n* Sitka Community Hospital is in the downtown area and offers a full range of health care services including general medical care, surgery, 24/7 emergency room, laboratory, radiology, rehabilitative services, outpatient clinic, home health, infusion therapy, visiting specialists and long-term care.\n* Edgecumbe Hospital is across Sitka Harbor on [[Japonski Island]] about half a mile from [[Sitka Rocky Gutierrez Airport]]. The facility is part of the Southeast Alaska Regional Health Consortium, or SEARHC, a non-profit tribal health consortium of 18 Native communities. The hospital serves as a regional referral center for people throughout Southeast Alaska, and also provides primary outpatient care. Numerous specialty clinics are offered at the hospital that are not available in the smaller communities such as neurology, orthopedic, dermatology, ophthalmology and denture clinics.\n\n==Notable people==\n\n*[[Dale DeArmond]], printmaker and book illustrator\n*[[Annie Furuhjelm]], Finnish journalist and legislator\n*[[Sheldon Jackson]], [[Presbyterian Church in the United States|Presbyterian]] [[missionary]] in Alaska in late 19th century\n*[[Scott McAdams]], 2010 Democratic U.S. Senate Candidate\n*[[Richard Nelson (author)|Richard Nelson]], cultural anthropologist, writer, and activist\n*[[Teri Rofkar]], Tlingit weaver\n*[[John Straley]], award-winning author\n\n==Twin towns \u2013 sister cities==\n{{Further|List of twin towns and sister cities in the United States}}\nSitka has the following sister city:<ref>[http://www.gov.state.ak.us/trade/2005/sister_states.php Alaska sister cities index] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205045516/http://www.gov.state.ak.us/trade/2005/sister_states.php |date=February 5, 2012 }}</ref>\n* {{flagdeco|JPN}} [[Nemuro, Hokkaid\u014d|Nemuro]], [[Hokkaido]], Japan <ref>https://asiamattersforamerica.org/asia/data/sister-partnerships</ref>\n\n==Attractions==\n[[File:The Pioneer House Sitka.jpg|thumb|The [[Sitka Pioneer Home|Pioneer Home]], one of Sitka's many historic structures, in May 2002]]\nSitka's attractions include:\n\n* [[Alaska Raptor Center]]\n* [[Castle Hill (Sitka, Alaska)|Baranof Castle Hill]]\n* [[Sheet'k\u00e1 Kw\u00e1an Naa Kah\u00eddi]]\n* [[Russian Bishop's House]]\n* [[Saint Lazaria National Wildlife Refuge]]\n* [[St. Michael's Cathedral (Sitka, Alaska)|St. Michael's Cathedral]]\n* [[Sheldon Jackson Museum]]\n* [[Sitka Fine Arts Camp]]\n* [[Isabel Miller Museum|Sitka Historical Museum]]\n* [[Sitka Jazz Festival]]\n* [[Sitka Lutheran Church]]\n* [[Sitka National Historical Park]]\n* [[Sitka Pioneer Home]]\n* [[Sitka Summer Music Festival]]\n* [[Swan Lake (Alaska)|Swan Lake]]\n* [[Tongass National Forest]]\n\nThe flora and fauna of Sitka and its surrounding area are popular.

As a comparison, this is almost four times the size of the state of [[Rhode Island]].\n\nSitka displaced Juneau, Alaska as the largest incorporated city by area in the United States upon the 2000 incorporation with {{convert|2874|sqmi|km2}} of incorporated area.

Only 5.1 days per year see highs at or above {{convert|70|\u00b0F|0}}; conversely, there are only 10 days with the high not exceeding freezing.<ref name = NCDC/>The winters are extremely mild compared to inland areas of similar and much more southerly parallels due to the intense maritime moderation. The relatively mild nights ensure that four months stay above the {{convert|50|F|C}} isotherm that normally separates inland areas from being boreal in nature. Overall, the climate is like that of [[Fort William, Highland|Fort William]] in [[Scotland]]. Due to the mild winter nights, [[plant hardiness]] is low for the latitude.\n\nThe highest temperature ever recorded was {{convert|88|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|1}} on July 30, 1976.

Vehicles are usually brought to Sitka via the [[Alaska Marine Highway]] ferry system. However, a vehicle is not an absolute necessity in Sitka, as there are only {{convert|14|mi|abbr=off}} of road from one end of the island to another. Most everything is within walking distance from the downtown area which is where the majority of employers are situated. Public transportation is also available.\n\nBy air, [[Sitka Rocky Gutierrez Airport]] offers scheduled passenger jet service operated year-round by [[Alaska Airlines]] and seasonally by [[Delta Connection]] as well as commuter, charter, and bush air service provided by Harris Aircraft Services.  Harris Air provides scheduled service to several smaller communities in the southeast as well as to Juneau.\n\nDelays in fall and winter due to Sitka's weather are frequent. The airport is located on Japonski Island, which is connected to Baranof Island by the [[John O'Connell Bridge|O'Connell Bridge]]. The O'Connell Bridge, completed in 1972, was the first vehicular [[cable-stayed bridge]] in the United States. The [[Sitka Seaplane Base]] is [[seaplane]] landing area situated in the [[Sitka Channel]], adjacent to the airport.\n\nFerry travel back and forth to Juneau, Ketchikan and other towns in Southeast Alaska is provided through the [[Alaska Marine Highway System]]. The ferry terminal is located {{convert|7|mi|km}} north of downtown and a ferry ticket costs about $49 per person each way to Juneau (as of July 2013). Vehicles, pets and bicycles can also be taken on the ferry for an additional charge.\n\nSitka's location on the outer coast of the Alaska Panhandle is removed from routes run through [[Chatham Strait]]. This, in addition to the tides of [[Peril Strait]]s that allow mainline vessels through only at slack tide combine to result in no designated service by a vessel and minimal service overall. However, the AMHS is often the mode of transportation of choice when the schedule proves convenient because of its much cheaper cost.\n\nAlaska Marine Lines, a barge and freight company, has the ability to move cars to other communities connected to the mainland by road systems.\n\nA three-way partnership of non-profits (Center for Community, [[Sitka Tribe of Alaska]], and Southeast Senior Services) offers public bus transit, funded by the [[Federal Transit Administration]] and the [[Alaska Department of Transportation]]. All buses are fully accessible, with service from 6:30&nbsp;a.m. to 7:30&nbsp;p.m., Monday through Friday.\n\nIn 2008, the [[League of American Bicyclists]] awarded Sitka the bronze level in bicycle friendliness making Sitka the first [[League of American Bicyclists#Bicycle Friendly Communities|bicycle-friendly community]] in Alaska.

Sitka is the only Alaska community to have both a Bicycle Friendly Community and a Walk Friendly Communities designation.\n\n===Healthcare===\nThere are two hospitals in Sitka:\n* Sitka Community Hospital is in the downtown area and offers a full range of health care services including general medical care, surgery, 24/7 emergency room, laboratory, radiology, rehabilitative services, outpatient clinic, home health, infusion therapy, visiting specialists and long-term care.\n* Edgecumbe Hospital is across Sitka Harbor on [[Japonski Island]] about half a mile from [[Sitka Rocky Gutierrez Airport]]. The facility is part of the Southeast Alaska Regional Health Consortium, or SEARHC, a non-profit tribal health consortium of 18 Native communities. The hospital serves as a regional referral center for people throughout Southeast Alaska, and also provides primary outpatient care. Numerous specialty clinics are offered at the hospital that are not available in the smaller communities such as neurology, orthopedic, dermatology, ophthalmology and denture clinics.\n\n==Notable people==\n\n*[[Dale DeArmond]], printmaker and book illustrator\n*[[Annie Furuhjelm]], Finnish journalist and legislator\n*[[Sheldon Jackson]], [[Presbyterian Church in the United States|Presbyterian]] [[missionary]] in Alaska in late 19th century\n*[[Scott McAdams]], 2010 Democratic U.S. Senate Candidate\n*[[Richard Nelson (author)|Richard Nelson]], cultural anthropologist, writer, and activist\n*[[Teri Rofkar]], Tlingit weaver\n*[[John Straley]], award-winning author\n\n==Twin towns \u2013 sister cities==\n{{Further|List of twin towns and sister cities in the United States}}\nSitka has the following sister city:<ref>[http://www.gov.state.ak.us/trade/2005/sister_states.php Alaska sister cities index] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205045516/http://www.gov.state.ak.us/trade/2005/sister_states.php |date=February 5, 2012 }}</ref>\n* {{flagdeco|JPN}} [[Nemuro, Hokkaid\u014d|Nemuro]], [[Hokkaido]], Japan <ref>https://asiamattersforamerica.org/asia/data/sister-partnerships</ref>\n\n==Attractions==\n[[File:The Pioneer House Sitka.jpg|thumb|The [[Sitka Pioneer Home|Pioneer Home]], one of Sitka's many historic structures, in May 2002]]\nSitka's attractions include:\n\n* [[Alaska Raptor Center]]\n* [[Castle Hill (Sitka, Alaska)|Baranof Castle Hill]]\n* [[Sheet'k\u00e1 Kw\u00e1an Naa Kah\u00eddi]]\n* [[Russian Bishop's House]]\n* [[Saint Lazaria National Wildlife Refuge]]\n* [[St. Michael's Cathedral (Sitka, Alaska)|St. Michael's Cathedral]]\n* [[Sheldon Jackson Museum]]\n* [[Sitka Fine Arts Camp]]\n* [[Isabel Miller Museum|Sitka Historical Museum]]\n* [[Sitka Jazz Festival]]\n* [[Sitka Lutheran Church]]\n* [[Sitka National Historical Park]]\n* [[Sitka Pioneer Home]]\n* [[Sitka Summer Music Festival]]\n* [[Swan Lake (Alaska)|Swan Lake]]\n* [[Tongass National Forest]]\n\nThe flora and fauna of Sitka and its surrounding area are popular.

Few people undertake this peak; those interested should consult with one who has summited previously.\n* Kayaking is a popular activity and small guided day excursions are offered locally.\n* There are a number of maintained trails in the Sitka area, many of which are accessible from Sitka's road system.\n\n==In popular culture==\n* [[Louis L'Amour]] penned ''Sitka'', his fictional account of the events surrounding the United States' purchase of the Alaska Territory from the Russians for $7.2 million in 1867.\n* Novelist [[James Michener]] lived at Sitka's [[Sheldon Jackson College]] while doing research for his epic work, [[Alaska (novel)|''Alaska'']].\n* The [[1952 film]] ''[[The World in His Arms]]'' has Russian Sitka as one of its settings.\n* Sitka is the opening setting in [[Ivan Doig]]'s 1982 historical fiction, ''The Sea Runners''.\n* Sitka is mentioned in Chapter 53 of [[James Clavell]]'s 1993 historical fiction about Japan, ''[[Gai-Jin (novel)|Gai-Jin]]''.\n* Mystery author [[John Straley]] described Sitka as \"...an island town where people feel crowded by the land and spread out on the sea.\"\n* Part of the action in the novel ''[[C\u00e9sar Cascabel]]'' by [[Jules Verne]] takes place in Sitka in May\u2013June 1867, during the transfer of ownership to the United States.\n* A fictionalized Sitka, with a population in the millions and the host of a fictional 1977 [[World's Fair]], is the setting of the alternate history detective story ''[[The Yiddish Policemen's Union]]'', by [[Michael Chabon]].\n* Sitka is featured in the episode \"Z-9000\" from Argentine TV series Los Simuladores as the place where its antagonist,Lorenzo, is sent to keep him away from his wife which he used to assault,under the pretext that a clone of him is trying to kill him. \n* Sitka is a setting used in the 2009 feature ''[[The Proposal (2009 film)|The Proposal]]'', although the scenes were filmed in [[Rockport, Massachusetts]].\n* Sitka was featured in a 2012 episode of the Travel Channel's popular series ''[[Bizarre Foods]]'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.travelchannel.com/video/diving-for-dinner-in-alaska |title=Diving for Dinner in Alaska |publisher=Travel Channel |access-date=2013-07-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130731040215/http://www.travelchannel.com/video/diving-for-dinner-in-alaska |archive-date=2013-07-31 |url-status=live }}</ref> starring [[Andrew Zimmern]].

Since the population explosion dictates that childbearing be kept to a minimum, parents-and-children will be only one of many \"families\": couples, age groups, working groups, mixed communes, blood-related clans, class groups, creative groups. Single women will have the right to stay single without ridicule, without the attitudes now betrayed by \"spinster\" and \"bachelor.\" Lesbians or homosexuals will no longer be denied legally binding marriages, complete with mutual-support agreements and inheritance rights.

Since the population explosion dictates that childbearing be kept to a minimum, parents-and-children will be only one of many \"families\": couples, age groups, working groups, mixed communes, blood-related clans, class groups, creative groups. Single women will have the right to stay single without ridicule, without the attitudes now betrayed by \"spinster\" and \"bachelor.\" Lesbians or homosexuals will no longer be denied legally binding marriages, complete with mutual-support agreements and inheritance rights.
