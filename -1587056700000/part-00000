Before the Late Triassic, the area now occupied by the Gulf of Mexico consisted of dry land, which included continental crust that now underlies [[Yucat\u00e1n]], within the middle of the large supercontinent of [[Pangea]]. This land lay south of a continuous mountain range that extended from north-central Mexico, through the [[Marathon Uplift]] in West [[Texas]] and the [[Ouachita Mountains]] of [[Oklahoma]], and to [[Alabama]] where it linked directly to the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. It was created by the collision of continental plates that formed Pangea. As interpreted by Roy Van Arsdale and Randel T. Cox, this mountain range was breached in Late [[Cretaceous]] times by the formation of the [[Mississippi Embayment]].<ref name=\"VanArsdale(2009)\">Van Arsdale, R. B.

First, there was a Late Triassic-Early [[Jurassic]] phase of rifting during which [[rift valley]]s formed and filled with continental [[red beds]]. Second, as rifting progressed through Early and Middle Jurassic time, continental crust was stretched and thinned. This thinning created a broad zone of transitional crust, which displays modest and uneven thinning with block faulting, and a broad zone of uniformly thinned transitional crust, which is half the typical {{convert|40|km|adj=on|lk=on|sp=us}} thickness of normal continental crust. It was at this time that rifting first created a connection to the Pacific Ocean across central Mexico and later eastward to the Atlantic Ocean. This flooded the opening basin to create the Gulf of Mexico as an enclosed marginal sea. While the Gulf of Mexico was a restricted basin, the subsiding transitional crust was blanketed by the widespread deposition of [[Louann Salt]] and associated [[anhydrite]] [[evaporite]]s. During the Late Jurassic, continued rifting widened the Gulf of Mexico and progressed to the point that [[sea-floor spreading]] and formation of [[oceanic crust]] occurred. At this point, sufficient circulation with the Atlantic Ocean was established that the deposition of Louann Salt ceased.<ref name=\"Salvador(1991)\"/><ref name=\"SternOther(2010)\"/><ref name=\"Buffler(1991)\">Buffler, R.

Initially, the combination of crustal stretching and cooling caused about {{convert|5|\u2013|7|km|abbr=on}} of tectonic subsidence of the central thin transitional and oceanic crust. Because subsidence occurred faster than sediment could fill it, the Gulf of Mexico expanded and deepened.<ref name=\"Salvador(1991)\"/><ref name=\"Galloway(2008)\"/><ref name=\"SawyerOther(1991)\">Sawyer, D.

Instead, Columbus sailed into the Caribbean around Cuba and [[Hispaniola]]. The first European exploration of the Gulf of Mexico was by [[Amerigo Vespucci]] in 1497. He followed the coastal land mass of [[Central America]] before returning to the Atlantic Ocean via the Straits of Florida between [[Florida]] and Cuba. In his letters, Vespucci described this trip, and once [[Juan de la Cosa]] returned to Spain, a [[Map of Juan de la Cosa|famous world map]], depicting Cuba as an island, was produced.\n\nIn 1506, [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] took part in the conquest of Hispaniola and Cuba, receiving a large estate of land and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indian]] slaves for his effort. In 1510, he accompanied [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez de Cu\u00e9llar]], an aide of the governor of Hispaniola, in his expedition to conquer Cuba. In 1518 Vel\u00e1zquez put him in command of an expedition to explore and secure the interior of Mexico for colonization.\n\nIn 1517, [[Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba (discoverer of Yucat\u00e1n)|Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba]] discovered the [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]]. This was the first [[European ethnic groups|European]] encounter with [[Mesoamerican civilizations|an advanced civilization]] in the [[Americas]], with solidly built buildings and a complex social organization which they recognized as being comparable to those of the [[Old World]]; they also had reason to expect that this new land would have [[gold]]. All of this encouraged two further expeditions, the first in 1518 under the command of [[Juan de Grijalva]], and the second in 1519 under the command of Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s, which led to the Spanish exploration, military invasion, and ultimately settlement and colonization known as the [[Conquest of Mexico]]. Hern\u00e1ndez did not live to see the continuation of his work: he died in 1517, the year of his expedition, as the result of the injuries and the extreme thirst suffered during the voyage, and disappointed in the knowledge that [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]] had given precedence to Grijalva as the captain of the next expedition to Yucat\u00e1n.\n\nIn 1523, [[\u00c1ngel de Villafa\u00f1e]] sailed toward [[Mexico City]] but was shipwrecked en route along the coast of [[Padre Island]], Texas, in 1554. When word of the disaster reached Mexico City, the viceroy requested a rescue fleet and immediately sent Villafa\u00f1e marching overland to find the treasure-laden vessels. Villafa\u00f1e traveled to P\u00e1nuco and hired a ship to transport him to the site, which had already been visited from that community. He arrived in time to greet Garc\u00eda de Escalante Alvarado (a nephew of Pedro de Alvarado), commander of the salvage operation, when Alvarado arrived by sea on July 22, 1554. The team labored until September 12 to salvage the Padre Island treasure. This loss, in combination with other ship disasters around the Gulf of Mexico, gave rise to a plan for establishing a settlement on the northern Gulf Coast to protect shipping and more quickly rescue castaways. As a result, the expedition of [[Trist\u00e1n de Luna y Arellano]] was sent and landed at [[Pensacola Bay]] on August 15, 1559.\n\nOn December 11, 1526, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] granted [[P\u00e1nfilo de Narv\u00e1ez]] a license to claim what is now the Gulf Coast of the United States, known as the [[Narv\u00e1ez expedition]]. The contract gave him one year to gather an army, leave Spain, be large enough to found at least two towns of 100 people each, and garrison two more fortresses anywhere along the coast. On April 7, 1528, they spotted land north of what is now [[Tampa Bay]]. They turned south and traveled for two days looking for a great harbor the master pilot Miruelo knew of. Sometime during these two days, one of the five remaining ships was lost on the rugged coast, but nothing else is known of it.\n\nIn 1697, [[Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville]] sailed for France and was chosen by the Minister of Marine to lead an expedition to rediscover the mouth of the [[Mississippi River]] and to colonize [[Louisiana]] which the English coveted. Iberville's fleet sailed from Brest on October 24, 1698. On January 25, 1699, Iberville reached Santa Rosa Island in front of [[Pensacola]] founded by the Spanish; he sailed from there to [[Mobile Bay]] and explored Massacre Island, later renamed [[Dauphin Island]]. He cast anchor between [[Cat Island (Mississippi)|Cat Island]] and [[Ship Island]]; and on February 13, 1699, he went to the mainland, Biloxi, with his brother [[Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville]].<ref name=\"Kevin_Knight\">{{cite web |year=2009 |url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07614b.htm|title = Pierre Le Moyne, Sieur d'Iberville|publisher = newadvent.org| accessdate = May 8, 2009 | last=Kevin Knight |quote=}}</ref> On May 1, 1699, he completed a fort on the north-east side of the Bay of Biloxi, a little to the rear of what is now [[Ocean Springs, Mississippi]].

The shipwreck, whose real identity remains a mystery, lay forgotten at the bottom of the sea until it was discovered in 2002 by an oilfield inspection crew working for the Okeanos Gas Gathering Company (OGGC). In May 2007, an expedition, led by Texas A&M University and funded by OGGC under an agreement with the Minerals Management Service (now [[BOEM]]), was launched to undertake the deepest scientific archaeological excavation ever attempted at that time to study the site on the seafloor and recover artifacts for eventual public display in the [[Louisiana State Museum]].

The Mexican portion of the Gulf coastline spans 1,743 miles (2,805&nbsp;km). On its southeast quadrant the Gulf is bordered by Cuba. It supports major American, Mexican and Cuban fishing industries. The outer margins of the wide continental shelves of Yucat\u00e1n and Florida receive cooler, [[nutrient]]-enriched waters from the deep by a process known as [[upwelling]], which stimulates plankton growth in the [[euphotic zone]].

Other circulation features include the anticyclonic [[gyre]]s which are shed by the Loop Current and travel westward where they eventually dissipate, and a permanent cyclonic gyre in the Bay of Campeche. The Bay of Campeche in Mexico constitutes a major arm of the Gulf of Mexico.  Additionally, the gulf's shoreline is fringed by numerous bays and smaller inlets. A number of rivers empty into the gulf, most notably the Mississippi River and Rio Grande in the northern gulf, and the [[Grijalva River|Grijalva]] and [[Usumacinta River|Usumacinta]] rivers in the southern gulf. The land that forms the gulf's coast, including many long, narrow barrier islands, is almost uniformly low-lying and is characterized by marshes and swamps as well as stretches of sandy beach.\n\nThe Gulf of Mexico is an excellent example of a [[passive margin]]. The [[continental shelf]] is quite wide at most points along the coast, most notably at the Florida and Yucat\u00e1n Peninsulas. The shelf is exploited for its [[petroleum|oil]] by means of offshore drilling rigs, most of which are situated in the western gulf and in the Bay of Campeche. Another important commercial activity is fishing; major catches include [[Lutjanus campechanus|red snapper]], [[amberjack]], [[tilefish]], [[swordfish]], and various [[grouper]], as well as [[shrimp]] and [[crabs]].  [[Oysters]] are also harvested on a large scale from many of the bays and sounds. Other important industries along the coast include shipping, petrochemical processing and storage, military use, paper manufacture, and tourism.\n\nThe gulf's warm water temperature can feed powerful Atlantic [[hurricane]]s causing extensive human death and other destruction as happened with [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005. In the Atlantic, a hurricane will draw up cool water from the depths and making it less likely that further hurricanes will follow in its wake (warm water being one of the preconditions necessary for their formation). However, the Gulf is shallower; when a hurricane passes over the water temperature may drop but it soon rebounds and becomes capable of supporting another tropical storm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/NewImages/images.php3?img_id=17038 |title=Warm Waters Provide Fuel for Potential Storms |publisher=[[NASA Earth Observatory]] |accessdate=May 5, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001040517/http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/NewImages/images.php3?img_id=17038 |archivedate=October 1, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nThe Gulf is considered [[aseismic]]; however, mild tremors have been recorded throughout history (usually 5.0 or less on the [[Richter magnitude scale]]).

Before the Late Triassic, the area now occupied by the Gulf of Mexico consisted of dry land, which included continental crust that now underlies [[Yucat\u00e1n]], within the middle of the large supercontinent of [[Pangea]]. This land lay south of a continuous mountain range that extended from north-central Mexico, through the [[Marathon Uplift]] in West [[Texas]] and the [[Ouachita Mountains]] of [[Oklahoma]], and to [[Alabama]] where it linked directly to the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. It was created by the collision of continental plates that formed Pangea. As interpreted by Roy Van Arsdale and Randel T.

First, there was a Late Triassic-Early [[Jurassic]] phase of rifting during which [[rift valley]]s formed and filled with continental [[red beds]]. Second, as rifting progressed through Early and Middle Jurassic time, continental crust was stretched and thinned. This thinning created a broad zone of transitional crust, which displays modest and uneven thinning with block faulting, and a broad zone of uniformly thinned transitional crust, which is half the typical {{convert|40|km|adj=on|lk=on|sp=us}} thickness of normal continental crust. It was at this time that rifting first created a connection to the Pacific Ocean across central Mexico and later eastward to the Atlantic Ocean. This flooded the opening basin to create the Gulf of Mexico as an enclosed marginal sea. While the Gulf of Mexico was a restricted basin, the subsiding transitional crust was blanketed by the widespread deposition of [[Louann Salt]] and associated [[anhydrite]] [[evaporite]]s. During the Late Jurassic, continued rifting widened the Gulf of Mexico and progressed to the point that [[sea-floor spreading]] and formation of [[oceanic crust]] occurred. At this point, sufficient circulation with the Atlantic Ocean was established that the deposition of Louann Salt ceased.<ref name=\"Salvador(1991)\"/><ref name=\"SternOther(2010)\"/><ref name=\"Buffler(1991)\">Buffler, R.

Instead, Columbus sailed into the Caribbean around Cuba and [[Hispaniola]]. The first European exploration of the Gulf of Mexico was by [[Amerigo Vespucci]] in 1497. He followed the coastal land mass of [[Central America]] before returning to the Atlantic Ocean via the Straits of Florida between [[Florida]] and Cuba. In his letters, Vespucci described this trip, and once [[Juan de la Cosa]] returned to Spain, a [[Map of Juan de la Cosa|famous world map]], depicting Cuba as an island, was produced.\n\nIn 1506, [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] took part in the conquest of Hispaniola and Cuba, receiving a large estate of land and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indian]] slaves for his effort. In 1510, he accompanied [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez de Cu\u00e9llar]], an aide of the governor of Hispaniola, in his expedition to conquer Cuba. In 1518 Vel\u00e1zquez put him in command of an expedition to explore and secure the interior of Mexico for colonization.\n\nIn 1517, [[Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba (discoverer of Yucat\u00e1n)|Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba]] discovered the [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]]. This was the first [[European ethnic groups|European]] encounter with [[Mesoamerican civilizations|an advanced civilization]] in the [[Americas]], with solidly built buildings and a complex social organization which they recognized as being comparable to those of the [[Old World]]; they also had reason to expect that this new land would have [[gold]]. All of this encouraged two further expeditions, the first in 1518 under the command of [[Juan de Grijalva]], and the second in 1519 under the command of Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s, which led to the Spanish exploration, military invasion, and ultimately settlement and colonization known as the [[Conquest of Mexico]]. Hern\u00e1ndez did not live to see the continuation of his work: he died in 1517, the year of his expedition, as the result of the injuries and the extreme thirst suffered during the voyage, and disappointed in the knowledge that [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]] had given precedence to Grijalva as the captain of the next expedition to Yucat\u00e1n.\n\nIn 1523, [[\u00c1ngel de Villafa\u00f1e]] sailed toward [[Mexico City]] but was shipwrecked en route along the coast of [[Padre Island]], Texas, in 1554. When word of the disaster reached Mexico City, the viceroy requested a rescue fleet and immediately sent Villafa\u00f1e marching overland to find the treasure-laden vessels. Villafa\u00f1e traveled to P\u00e1nuco and hired a ship to transport him to the site, which had already been visited from that community. He arrived in time to greet Garc\u00eda de Escalante Alvarado (a nephew of Pedro de Alvarado), commander of the salvage operation, when Alvarado arrived by sea on July 22, 1554. The team labored until September 12 to salvage the Padre Island treasure. This loss, in combination with other ship disasters around the Gulf of Mexico, gave rise to a plan for establishing a settlement on the northern Gulf Coast to protect shipping and more quickly rescue castaways. As a result, the expedition of [[Trist\u00e1n de Luna y Arellano]] was sent and landed at [[Pensacola Bay]] on August 15, 1559.\n\nOn December 11, 1526, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] granted [[P\u00e1nfilo de Narv\u00e1ez]] a license to claim what is now the Gulf Coast of the United States, known as the [[Narv\u00e1ez expedition]]. The contract gave him one year to gather an army, leave Spain, be large enough to found at least two towns of 100 people each, and garrison two more fortresses anywhere along the coast. On April 7, 1528, they spotted land north of what is now [[Tampa Bay]]. They turned south and traveled for two days looking for a great harbor the master pilot Miruelo knew of. Sometime during these two days, one of the five remaining ships was lost on the rugged coast, but nothing else is known of it.\n\nIn 1697, [[Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville]] sailed for France and was chosen by the Minister of Marine to lead an expedition to rediscover the mouth of the [[Mississippi River]] and to colonize [[Louisiana]] which the English coveted. Iberville's fleet sailed from Brest on October 24, 1698. On January 25, 1699, Iberville reached Santa Rosa Island in front of [[Pensacola]] founded by the Spanish; he sailed from there to [[Mobile Bay]] and explored Massacre Island, later renamed [[Dauphin Island]]. He cast anchor between [[Cat Island (Mississippi)|Cat Island]] and [[Ship Island]]; and on February 13, 1699, he went to the mainland, Biloxi, with his brother [[Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville]].<ref name=\"Kevin_Knight\">{{cite web |year=2009 |url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07614b.htm|title = Pierre Le Moyne, Sieur d'Iberville|publisher = newadvent.org| accessdate = May 8, 2009 | last=Kevin Knight |quote=}}</ref> On May 1, 1699, he completed a fort on the north-east side of the Bay of Biloxi, a little to the rear of what is now [[Ocean Springs, Mississippi]].

The shipwreck, whose real identity remains a mystery, lay forgotten at the bottom of the sea until it was discovered in 2002 by an oilfield inspection crew working for the Okeanos Gas Gathering Company (OGGC). In May 2007, an expedition, led by Texas A&M University and funded by OGGC under an agreement with the Minerals Management Service (now [[BOEM]]), was launched to undertake the deepest scientific archaeological excavation ever attempted at that time to study the site on the seafloor and recover artifacts for eventual public display in the [[Louisiana State Museum]].

The Mexican portion of the Gulf coastline spans 1,743 miles (2,805&nbsp;km). On its southeast quadrant the Gulf is bordered by Cuba. It supports major American, Mexican and Cuban fishing industries. The outer margins of the wide continental shelves of Yucat\u00e1n and Florida receive cooler, [[nutrient]]-enriched waters from the deep by a process known as [[upwelling]], which stimulates plankton growth in the [[euphotic zone]].

Other circulation features include the anticyclonic [[gyre]]s which are shed by the Loop Current and travel westward where they eventually dissipate, and a permanent cyclonic gyre in the Bay of Campeche. The Bay of Campeche in Mexico constitutes a major arm of the Gulf of Mexico.  Additionally, the gulf's shoreline is fringed by numerous bays and smaller inlets. A number of rivers empty into the gulf, most notably the Mississippi River and Rio Grande in the northern gulf, and the [[Grijalva River|Grijalva]] and [[Usumacinta River|Usumacinta]] rivers in the southern gulf. The land that forms the gulf's coast, including many long, narrow barrier islands, is almost uniformly low-lying and is characterized by marshes and swamps as well as stretches of sandy beach.\n\nThe Gulf of Mexico is an excellent example of a [[passive margin]]. The [[continental shelf]] is quite wide at most points along the coast, most notably at the Florida and Yucat\u00e1n Peninsulas. The shelf is exploited for its [[petroleum|oil]] by means of offshore drilling rigs, most of which are situated in the western gulf and in the Bay of Campeche. Another important commercial activity is fishing; major catches include [[Lutjanus campechanus|red snapper]], [[amberjack]], [[tilefish]], [[swordfish]], and various [[grouper]], as well as [[shrimp]] and [[crabs]].  [[Oysters]] are also harvested on a large scale from many of the bays and sounds. Other important industries along the coast include shipping, petrochemical processing and storage, military use, paper manufacture, and tourism.\n\nThe gulf's warm water temperature can feed powerful Atlantic [[hurricane]]s causing extensive human death and other destruction as happened with [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005. In the Atlantic, a hurricane will draw up cool water from the depths and making it less likely that further hurricanes will follow in its wake (warm water being one of the preconditions necessary for their formation). However, the Gulf is shallower; when a hurricane passes over the water temperature may drop but it soon rebounds and becomes capable of supporting another tropical storm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/NewImages/images.php3?img_id=17038 |title=Warm Waters Provide Fuel for Potential Storms |publisher=[[NASA Earth Observatory]] |accessdate=May 5, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001040517/http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/NewImages/images.php3?img_id=17038 |archivedate=October 1, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nThe Gulf is considered [[aseismic]]; however, mild tremors have been recorded throughout history (usually 5.0 or less on the [[Richter magnitude scale]]).

However he became corrupted by its power and a terrible war broke out. The land was devastated by the now fearless warlord Chi You. A young, wise and courageous man, Huang Di (Yellow Emperor) led his people against Chi You with the help of the Supreme Goddess. He wielded the power of the Dragon and eventually won the war. The Supreme Goddess sealed Huang Di's ultimate weapon, a gem called the Dragons Soul, in Loulan in far western China. Now the Qin Emperor seeks the Demon Robot which is the last of 81 bronze giants created by Chi You.\n\n===Story===\nIn a remote border town, the rebel Shaoyu and his troops are observing the actions of the Qin army. A mischievous young boy, Tianming is entrusted with a metallic ball by his Uncle Lu, machinery expert. However, he is under observation by the Qin and is attacked by the Yin Yang Priestesses of Birth and Dearth, accompanied by Gongshu Chou and his miniature machinery lizards. Tianming escapes and is saved from the Qin soldiers by Ge Nie and his sword Rainbow Abyss. Wei Zhuang and his Quicksand Group arrive to seize the metallic ball, but Ne Gie enables Tianming to escape. Tianming then encounters Shaoyu and they fight over the metallic ball which transforms into the tiny metal-eating dragon Pi Xiu. While trying to catch Pi Xiu, its owner, the mysterious Xiao Li arrives. She wears a necklace containing a blue gem called the Tears of a Goddess. All three are captured by Qin troops although Pi Xiu escapes. Pi Xiu frees the boys, and Xiao Li rescues them on a flying machinery dragon, but it crashes in the desert. Pursued through the desert by a Qin General and the Quicksand Group, the three are saved by Ne Gie. They accidentally find the secret entrance to Loulan through underground rivers in the desert.\n\nIn Loulan, the High Priestess says Pi Xiu contains the gem called the Dragon's Soul. She denounces Xiao Li as a descendant of the treacherous Lord Chi and she is imprisoned with the boys and Ge Nie. The Quicksand Group arrive and seize the powerful Chi You sword while Gongshu Chou gets the Dragons Soul gem which gives him control over the Demon Robot. Meanwhile Tianming, Shaoyu and Xiao Li escape and climb inside the robot to stop it. Ne Gie manages to defeat Wei Zhuang and takes the sword.

However he became corrupted by its power and a terrible war broke out. The land was devastated by the now fearless warlord Chi You. A young, wise and courageous man, Huang Di (Yellow Emperor) led his people against Chi You with the help of the Supreme Goddess. He wielded the power of the Dragon and eventually won the war. The Supreme Goddess sealed Huang Di's ultimate weapon, a gem called the Dragons Soul, in Loulan in far western China. Now the Qin Emperor seeks the Demon Robot which is the last of 81 bronze giants created by Chi You.\n\n===Story===\nIn a remote border town, the rebel Shaoyu and his troops are observing the actions of the Qin army. A mischievous young boy, Tianming is entrusted with a metallic ball by his Uncle Lu, machinery expert. However, he is under observation by the Qin and is attacked by the Yin Yang Priestesses of Birth and Dearth, accompanied by Gongshu Chou and his miniature machinery lizards. Tianming escapes and is saved from the Qin soldiers by Ge Nie and his sword Rainbow Abyss. Wei Zhuang and his Quicksand Group arrive to seize the metallic ball, but Ne Gie enables Tianming to escape. Tianming then encounters Shaoyu and they fight over the metallic ball which transforms into the tiny metal-eating dragon Pi Xiu. While trying to catch Pi Xiu, its owner, the mysterious Xiao Li arrives. She wears a necklace containing a blue gem called the Tears of a Goddess. All three are captured by Qin troops although Pi Xiu escapes. Pi Xiu frees the boys, and Xiao Li rescues them on a flying machinery dragon, but it crashes in the desert. Pursued through the desert by a Qin General and the Quicksand Group, the three are saved by Ne Gie. They accidentally find the secret entrance to Loulan through underground rivers in the desert.\n\nIn Loulan, the High Priestess says Pi Xiu contains the gem called the Dragon's Soul. She denounces Xiao Li as a descendant of the treacherous Lord Chi and she is imprisoned with the boys and Ge Nie. The Quicksand Group arrive and seize the powerful Chi You sword while Gongshu Chou gets the Dragons Soul gem which gives him control over the Demon Robot. Meanwhile Tianming, Shaoyu and Xiao Li escape and climb inside the robot to stop it. Ne Gie manages to defeat Wei Zhuang and takes the sword. With the help of Pi Xiu, Xiao Li uses the sword to immobilize the robot and save Loulan. Finally, Ne Gie reveals to Tianming that the boy's father asked Ne Gie to protect him. As Xiao Li' body slowly fades away, the Priestess realizes that she was the physical embodiment of the Tears of the Princess.\n\n==Voice cast==\n\nFor detailed descriptions of the characters, see the [[List_of_The_Legend_of_Qin_characters | List of The Legend of Qin characters]].\n{|class=\"wikitable\" width=\"57%\"\n|- style=\"background:cornflowerblue; color:white\" align=center\n|style=\"width:3%\"|'''Voice Actor'''||style=\"width:7%\"|'''Character\n'''\n|-\n|\u51af\u9a8f\u9a85/[[Feng Junhua]]||\u8346\u5929\u660e/[[Jing Tianming]]\n|-\n|\u6c88\u8fbe\u5a01/[[Shen Dawei]]||\u9879\u5c11\u7fbd(\u9879\u7fbd)/[[Xiang ShaoYu|Xiang Shaoyu]]([[Xiang Yu]])\n|-\n|\u5b63\u51a0\u9716/[[Ji Guanlin]]||\u5c0f\u9ece/Xiao Li\n|-\n|\u5468\u4f76/[[Zhou Ji (Voice actor)|Zhou Ji]]||\u8c94\u8c85/[[Pixiu]]\n|-\n|\u5218\u94a6/[[Liu Qin]]||\u76d6\u8042/[[Ge Nie]]\n|-\n|\u5f20\u5609\u8bd1/[[Zhang Jiayi]]||\u536b\u5e84/[[Wei Zhuang (Qin's Moon)|Wei Zhuang]]\n|-\n|\u5434\u78ca/[[Wu Lei (Voice actor)|Wu Lei]]||\u9b54\u5316\u536b\u5e84/Possessed Wei Zhuang\n|-\n|/||\u767d\u51e4/White Phoenix\n|-\n|/||\u8d64\u7ec3/Crimson Lotus\n|-\n|\u9ec4\u83ba[[Huang Ying (Voice actor)|Huang Ying]]||\u5927\u53f8\u547d/Priestess of Death\n|-\n|/||\u5c11\u53f8\u547d/Priestess of Birth\n|-\n|\u738b\u8096\u5175/[[Wang Xiaobing]]||\u516c\u8f93\u4ec7/Gongshu Chou\n|-\n|\u7a0b\u7389\u73e0/[[Cheng Yuzhu]]||\u5415\u8001\u4f2f/Uncle L\u00fc\n|-\n|\u5b5f\u7965\u9f99/[[Meng Xianglong]]||\u6c34\u679c\u5c06\u519b/General Fruit\n|-\n|\u6e38\u519b/[[You Jun]]||\u79e6\u56fd\u526f\u5c06/Qin Vice General\n|-\n|\u72c4\u83f2\u83f2/[[Di Feifei]]||\u5927\u796d\u53f8/Loulan High Priestess\n|-\n|\u8d75\u4e7e\u666f/[[Zhao Qianjing]]||\u697c\u5170\u6b66\u58eb/Loulan soldier\n|-\n|\u949f\u6709\u9053/[[Zhong Youdao]]||\u65c1\u767d/Narrator\n|-\n|}\n\n==Reception==\nThe film earned {{CNY|59.984 million}} in China.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.cbooo.cn/m/594619|title= \u79e6\u65f6\u660e\u67083D\u7535\u5f71\u9f99\u817e\u4e07\u91cc\uff082014\uff09|accessdate= October 12, 2015|work= cbooo.cn|language= Chinese}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Legend Of Qin, The}}\n[[Category:2014 films]]\n[[Category:2010s fantasy adventure films]]\n[[Category:2014 animated films]]\n[[Category:Animated adventure films]]\n[[Category:Chinese animated fantasy films]]\n[[Category:Chinese films]]\n[[Category:Films based on television series]]\n[[Category:Wuxia films]]\n[[Category:2014 martial arts films]]\n[[Category:Chinese fantasy adventure films]]\n\n\n{{2010s-animated-film-stub}}\n{{2010s-China-film-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Reesorville", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eStory", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Qin_(film)"}

It was the second single from their fifth album ''[[Who's Next]]'' and was originally written by [[Pete Townshend]] for his ''[[Lifehouse (rock opera)|Lifehouse]]'' project.<ref>{{cite web |title = Behind Blue Eyes : The Who |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/196775/review/6067884|work=Rolling Stone |accessdate=16 June 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4433223.stm |title=The Streets lead Ivor nominations |work=BBC News |accessdate=16 June 2008 |date=11 April 2005}}</ref> The song is one of The Who's best-known recordings and has been covered by many artists.\n\n==Background==\n\"Behind Blue Eyes\" originated after a Who concert in [[Denver]] on 9 June 1970.<ref name=linernotes>{{cite web|last1=Cady|first1=Brian|title='Who's Next' liner notes|url=http://www.thewho.net/linernotes/WhosNext.htm|website=The Hypertext Who}}</ref> Following the performance, Townshend became tempted by a female [[groupie]], but he instead went back to his room alone, possibly as a result of the teachings of his spiritual leader, [[Meher Baba]].<ref name=bynumbers /> Upon reaching his room, he began writing a prayer, the first words being \"When my fist clenches, crack it open...\" These words later appeared as lyrics in the \"climactic rocking section\" of \"Behind Blue Eyes.\"<ref name=bynumbers />\n\nWhen \"Behind Blue Eyes\" was to be released as part of the aborted ''Lifehouse'' project, the song was sung from the point of view of the main villain, Jumbo. The lyrics are a first-person lament from Jumbo, who is always angry and full of angst because of all the pressure and temptation that surrounds him, and the song was intended to be his \"theme song\" had the project been successful. Pete Townshend said of the song's lyrics:\n\n{{quote|\"Behind Blue Eyes\" really is off the wall because that was a song sung by the villain of the piece [Jumbo], the fact that he felt in the original story that he was forced into a position of being a villain whereas he felt he was a good guy.<ref name=bynumbers>{{cite book|last1=Grantley|first1=Steve|last2=Parker|first2=Alan|title=The Who by Numbers: The Story of the Who Through Their Music|publisher=Helter Skelter}}</ref>|}}\n\nThe version of \"Behind Blue Eyes\" released on ''[[Who's Next]]'' in 1971 was the second version the band recorded; the first was recorded at the Record Plant in New York on 18 March 1971 and features [[Al Kooper]] on [[Hammond organ]].<ref>Who's Next \u2013 1995 Remastered Edition CD Booklet Page 23</ref> The original version was released as a bonus track on the 1995 CD reissue of ''[[Who's Next]]''.\n\n\"Behind Blue Eyes\" was initially considered for a UK single release, but Townshend claimed that the song was \"too much out of character\" for the British singles market.<ref name=bynumbers /> However, the song did eventually see a single release in France, Belgium, the United States and the Netherlands. Backed with \"[[My Wife]]\" in the US and \"[[Going Mobile]]\" in Europe, the song reached #34 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and #24 on ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]''.<ref name=linernotes />\n\nPete Townshend has also recorded two solo versions of the song. The original [[Demo (music)|demo]] of the song was featured on the ''[[Scoop (album)|Scoop]]'' album. The demo along with a newer recording of the song featuring an orchestral backing was featured in ''[[The Lifehouse Chronicles]]''.\n\n==Composition==\nThe song starts with a solo voice singing over an [[arpeggio|arpeggiated]] acoustic guitar in the key of [[E minor]], and a bass guitar and ethereal harmonies are added. Eventually, the song breaks out into a full-scale [[rock anthem]], with a second theme being introduced near the end, before a brief reprise of the quieter first theme. Songs written in alternating sections were a feature of Townshend's writing of the period, going back at least to ''[[Tommy (rock opera)|Tommy]]'', where the technique was used in \"[[Christmas (song)|Christmas]]\" and \"[[Go to the Mirror!]]\". The guitar riff at the end of the rock anthem section is also used after the [[bridge (music)|bridge]] during the song \"[[Won't Get Fooled Again]]\", perhaps serving as a link between the two songs when both were intended to be parts of a single rock opera.<!-- About songs written in alternating sections being a trademark, and comparisons to other works. -->\n\n==Chart performance==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!align=\"left\"|Chart (1971)\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Peak<br />position\n|-\n{{singlechart|Billboardhot100|34|artist=The Who|song=Behind Blue Eyes|artistid=184814|accessdate=2010-10-25|date=2003-12-6}}\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|US [[Cashbox (magazine)|''Cashbox'']]<ref name=linernotes />\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|24\n|}\n\n== Personnel ==\n*[[Roger Daltrey]] \u2013 lead vocals\n*[[Pete Townshend]] \u2013 acoustic and electric guitar, backing vocals\n*[[John Entwistle]] \u2013 bass, backing vocals\n*[[Keith Moon]] \u2013 drums\n\n==In other media==\nA cover was used in the FX television series, ''[[Legion (TV series)|Legion]]'', in season 2, episode 11.

The song is followed by a hidden track titled \"All That Easy\", after a few seconds of silence, making the total length 5:58. However, the hidden track is not featured in the single release.\n\nAlthough the cover received mixed reviews and reached only number 71 on the US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]], it was more successful worldwide. It reached number one in Sweden in February 2004, becoming the band's only number-one single there, and charted within the top three in Austria, Denmark, Germany and Norway. Elsewhere in Europe, it became a top-twenty hit in Belgium, France, the Netherlands and Switzerland while peaking at number 18 on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. In [[Australasia]], it reached number four in Australia and number five in New Zealand.\n\n===Critical reception===\nLimp Bizkit guitarist [[Wes Borland]], who was not in the band at the time of recording and releasing this cover, made the following comments about the song and video: \"This is probably the worst cover ever, and the video is awful. It's just really embarrasing, and it's so unbelievably self-indulgent. Someone must have really worked out hard to be able to take their shirt off and have Halle Berry make out with them.\"{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} It was also criticized by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine readers, who named it the second-worst cover song of all time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/rolling-stone-readers-choose-the-worst-cover-songs-of-all-time-12882/10-william-shatner-lucy-in-the-sky-with-diamonds-155039/|title=Rolling Stone Readers Choose the Worst Cover Songs of All Time|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=18 August 2011}}</ref>.

It contains scenes from the motion picture ''[[Gothika]]'', in which Berry stars. It depicts Berry and Limp Bizkit's vocalist [[Fred Durst]] in a relationship similar to the storyline of the film.

It was the second single from their fifth album ''[[Who's Next]]'' and was originally written by [[Pete Townshend]] for his ''[[Lifehouse (rock opera)|Lifehouse]]'' project.<ref>{{cite web |title = Behind Blue Eyes : The Who |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/196775/review/6067884|work=Rolling Stone |accessdate=16 June 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4433223.stm |title=The Streets lead Ivor nominations |work=BBC News |accessdate=16 June 2008 |date=11 April 2005}}</ref> The song is one of The Who's best-known recordings and has been covered by many artists.\n\n==Background==\n\"Behind Blue Eyes\" originated after a Who concert in [[Denver]] on 9 June 1970.<ref name=linernotes>{{cite web|last1=Cady|first1=Brian|title='Who's Next' liner notes|url=http://www.thewho.net/linernotes/WhosNext.htm|website=The Hypertext Who}}</ref> Following the performance, Townshend became tempted by a female [[groupie]], but he instead went back to his room alone, possibly as a result of the teachings of his spiritual leader, [[Meher Baba]].<ref name=bynumbers /> Upon reaching his room, he began writing a prayer, the first words being \"When my fist clenches, crack it open...\" These words later appeared as lyrics in the \"climactic rocking section\" of \"Behind Blue Eyes.\"<ref name=bynumbers />\n\nWhen \"Behind Blue Eyes\" was to be released as part of the aborted ''Lifehouse'' project, the song was sung from the point of view of the main villain, Jumbo. The lyrics are a first-person lament from Jumbo, who is always angry and full of angst because of all the pressure and temptation that surrounds him, and the song was intended to be his \"theme song\" had the project been successful. Pete Townshend said of the song's lyrics:\n\n{{quote|\"Behind Blue Eyes\" really is off the wall because that was a song sung by the villain of the piece [Jumbo], the fact that he felt in the original story that he was forced into a position of being a villain whereas he felt he was a good guy.<ref name=bynumbers>{{cite book|last1=Grantley|first1=Steve|last2=Parker|first2=Alan|title=The Who by Numbers: The Story of the Who Through Their Music|publisher=Helter Skelter}}</ref>|}}\n\nThe version of \"Behind Blue Eyes\" released on ''[[Who's Next]]'' in 1971 was the second version the band recorded; the first was recorded at the Record Plant in New York on 18 March 1971 and features [[Al Kooper]] on [[Hammond organ]].<ref>Who's Next \u2013 1995 Remastered Edition CD Booklet Page 23</ref> The original version was released as a bonus track on the 1995 CD reissue of ''[[Who's Next]]''.\n\n\"Behind Blue Eyes\" was initially considered for a UK single release, but Townshend claimed that the song was \"too much out of character\" for the British singles market.<ref name=bynumbers /> However, the song did eventually see a single release in France, Belgium, the United States and the Netherlands. Backed with \"[[My Wife]]\" in the US and \"[[Going Mobile]]\" in Europe, the song reached #34 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and #24 on ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]''.<ref name=linernotes />\n\nPete Townshend has also recorded two solo versions of the song. The original [[Demo (music)|demo]] of the song was featured on the ''[[Scoop (album)|Scoop]]'' album. The demo along with a newer recording of the song featuring an orchestral backing was featured in ''[[The Lifehouse Chronicles]]''.\n\n==Composition==\nThe song starts with a solo voice singing over an [[arpeggio|arpeggiated]] acoustic guitar in the key of [[E minor]], and a bass guitar and ethereal harmonies are added. Eventually, the song breaks out into a full-scale [[rock anthem]], with a second theme being introduced near the end, before a brief reprise of the quieter first theme. Songs written in alternating sections were a feature of Townshend's writing of the period, going back at least to ''[[Tommy (rock opera)|Tommy]]'', where the technique was used in \"[[Christmas (song)|Christmas]]\" and \"[[Go to the Mirror!]]\". The guitar riff at the end of the rock anthem section is also used after the [[bridge (music)|bridge]] during the song \"[[Won't Get Fooled Again]]\", perhaps serving as a link between the two songs when both were intended to be parts of a single rock opera.<!-- About songs written in alternating sections being a trademark, and comparisons to other works. -->\n\n==Chart performance==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!align=\"left\"|Chart (1971)\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Peak<br />position\n|-\n{{singlechart|Billboardhot100|34|artist=The Who|song=Behind Blue Eyes|artistid=184814|accessdate=2010-10-25|date=2003-12-6}}\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|US [[Cashbox (magazine)|''Cashbox'']]<ref name=linernotes />\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|24\n|}\n\n== Personnel ==\n*[[Roger Daltrey]] \u2013 lead vocals\n*[[Pete Townshend]] \u2013 acoustic and electric guitar, backing vocals\n*[[John Entwistle]] \u2013 bass, backing vocals\n*[[Keith Moon]] \u2013 drums\n\n==In other media==\nA cover was used in the FX television series, ''[[Legion (TV series)|Legion]]'', in season 2, episode 11.

The song is followed by a hidden track titled \"All That Easy\", after a few seconds of silence, making the total length 5:58. However, the hidden track is not featured in the single release.\n\nAlthough the cover received mixed reviews and reached only number 71 on the US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]], it was more successful worldwide. It reached number one in Sweden in February 2004, becoming the band's only number-one single there, and charted within the top three in Austria, Denmark, Germany and Norway. Elsewhere in Europe, it became a top-twenty hit in Belgium, France, the Netherlands and Switzerland while peaking at number 18 on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. In [[Australasia]], it reached number four in Australia and number five in New Zealand.\n\n===Critical reception===\nLimp Bizkit guitarist [[Wes Borland]], who was not in the band at the time of recording and releasing this cover, made the following comments about the song and video: \"This is probably the worst cover ever, and the video is awful. It's just really embarrasing, and it's so unbelievably self-indulgent. Someone must have really worked out hard to be able to take their shirt off and have Halle Berry make out with them.\"{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} It was also criticized by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine readers, who named it the second-worst cover song of all time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/rolling-stone-readers-choose-the-worst-cover-songs-of-all-time-12882/10-william-shatner-lucy-in-the-sky-with-diamonds-155039/|title=Rolling Stone Readers Choose the Worst Cover Songs of All Time|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=18 August 2011}}</ref>.

It contains scenes from the motion picture ''[[Gothika]]'', in which Berry stars. It depicts Berry and Limp Bizkit's vocalist [[Fred Durst]] in a relationship similar to the storyline of the film.

The Spanish built a [[Spanish Formosa|settlement in the north]] for a brief period but were driven out by the Dutch in 1642.\n\nIn 1662, [[Koxinga]], a loyalist of the [[Ming dynasty]] who had lost control of mainland China in 1644, defeated the Dutch and established a [[Kingdom of Tungning|base of operations]] on the island. His forces were defeated by the [[Qing dynasty]] in 1683, and parts of Taiwan became increasingly [[Taiwan under Qing rule|integrated into the Qing empire]]. Following the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] in 1895, the Qing [[1895 Japanese Conquest of Taiwan|ceded the island]], along with [[Penghu]], to the [[Empire of Japan]]. Taiwan produced rice and sugar to be exported to the Empire of Japan, and also served as a base for the [[South-East Asian theatre of World War II|Japanese invasion of Southeast Asia]] and [[Pacific War|the Pacific]] during World War II. [[Education in the Empire of Japan|Japanese imperial education]] was implemented in [[Taiwan]] and many Taiwanese also fought for Japan during the war.\n\nIn 1945, following the end of [[World War II]], the [[nationalist government]] of the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] (ROC), led by the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT), took control of Taiwan. In 1949, after losing control of [[mainland China]] in the [[Chinese Civil War]], the ROC government under the KMT [[Chinese Nationalist Party retreat to Taiwan|withdrew to Taiwan]] and [[Chiang Kai-shek]] declared [[martial law]]. The KMT ruled Taiwan (along with the Islands of Kinmen, [[Wuqiu, Kinmen|Wuqiu]] and the Matsu on the opposite side of the [[Taiwan Strait]]) as a [[single-party state]] for forty years, until democratic reforms in the 1980s, which led to the first-ever [[1996 Republic of China presidential election|direct presidential election]] in 1996.

The first punitive expedition was against the villages of Baccloan and Mattauw, north of [[Fort Provintia|Saccam]] near Tayowan. The Mattauw campaign had been easier than expected and the tribe submitted after having their village razed by fire. The campaign also served as a threat to other villages from Tirossen (modern [[Chiayi]]) to Lonkjiaow ([[Hengchun]]). The [[Lamey Island Massacre|1636 punitive attack]] on [[Lamay Island]] in response to the killing of the shipwrecked crews of the ''Beverwijck'' and the ''Golden Lion'' ended ten years later with the entire aboriginal population of 1100 removed from the island including 327 Lamayans killed in a cave, having been trapped there by the Dutch and suffocated in the fumes and smoke pumped into the cave by the Dutch and their allied aborigines from Saccam, Soulang and Pangsoya.{{sfnp|Blusse|Everts|2000}} The men were forced into slavery in [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] ([[Java]]) and the women and children became servants and wives for the Dutch officers.

Other parts of the deer were sold to Han traders for meat and medical use. The Dutch paid aborigines for the deer brought to them and tried to manage the deer stocks to keep up with demand. The Dutch also employed Han to farm [[sugarcane]] and rice for export. Some of these rice and sugarcane products reached as far as the markets of [[Persia]].

In response to raids by Zheng Jing and in an effort to starve out the forces in Taiwan, the Qing decreed to relocate all of the southern coastal towns and ports that had been the targets of raids by the Zheng fleet and thus provided supplies for the resistance. This measure largely backfired, and between 1662 and 1664, six major waves of immigration occurred from these coastal towns to Taiwan, spurred by the severe hardships incurred from the Qing relocation policy. In a move to take advantage of this Qing misstep, Zheng Jing promoted immigration to Taiwan by promising free eastern land cultivation and ownership for peasants in exchange for [[compulsory military service]] by all males in case the island was in danger of a Qing invasion.\n\n== Qing rule ==\n{{Main|Taiwan under Qing rule}}\n[[File:\u9e7f\u6e2f\u9f8d\u5c71\u5bfa\u5c71\u9580.jpg|thumb|right|Main gate of [[Lukang Longshan Temple]], built in 1786]]\n\n===Initial immigration restriction===\nIn 1683, following a naval engagement with Admiral [[Shi Lang]], one of Koxinga's father's trusted friends, Koxinga's grandson [[Zheng Keshuang]], surrendered to the [[Qing dynasty]].\n\nThere has been much confusion about Taiwan's association with the rumored \"Island of Dogs,\" \"Island of Women,\" etc., which were thought, by Han literati, to lie beyond the seas. Taiwan was officially regarded by the [[Kangxi Emperor]] as \"a ball of mud beyond the pale of civilization\" and did not appear on any map of the imperial domain until 1683.{{sfnp|Teng|2004|pp=34\u201359}} The act of presenting a map to the emperor was equal to presenting the lands of the empire. It took several more years before the Qing court would recognize Taiwan as part of the Qing realm. Prior to the Qing dynasty, China was conceived as a land [[Four Seas|bound by mountains, rivers and seas]]. The idea of an island as a part of China was unfathomable to the Han prior to the Qing frontier expansion effort of the 17th century.{{sfnp|Teng|2004|pp=34\u201349, 177\u2013179}}\n\nDespite the expense of the military and diplomatic campaign that brought Taiwan into the imperial realm, the general sentiment in [[Beijing]] was ambivalent. The point of the campaign had been to destroy the Zheng-family regime, not to conquer the island.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} The Kangxi Emperor expressed the sentiment that Taiwan was \"the size of a pellet; taking it is no gain; not taking it is no loss\" (\u5f48\u4e38\u4e4b\u5730\u3002\u5f97\u4e4b\u7121\u6240\u52a0\uff0c\u4e0d\u5f97\u7121\u6240\u640d).

The Koxinga reign had continued the tax systems of the Dutch, established schools and religious temples.\n\nFrom 1683, the [[Qing dynasty]] ruled the island as [[Taiwan Prefecture]] and in 1875 divided the island into two prefectures, north and south. In 1887, the island was declared as a separate [[Taiwan Province#Qing Dynasty|Fokien-Taiwan Province]].\n\nThe Qing authorities tried to limit immigration to Taiwan and barred families from traveling to Taiwan to ensure the immigrants would return to their families and ancestral graves. [[Illegal immigration]] continued, but many of the men had few prospects in war-weary Fujian and thus married locally, resulting in the idiom \"has [[Names of China#Tang|Tangshan]]{{efn|1=Tangshan means \"Chinese\".}} father, no Tangshan mother\" ({{zh|t=\u6709\u5510\u5c71\u516c\uff0c\u7121\u5510\u5c71\u5abd|poj=\u016a Tn\u0302g-soa\u207f kong, b\u00f4 Tn\u0302g-soa\u207f m\u00e1}}).<ref>{{holodict|60161}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Tai |first=Pao-tsun |title=The Concise History of Taiwan |edition=Chinese-English bilingual |year=2007 |publisher=Taiwan Historica |location=Nantou City |isbn=9789860109504 |page=52}}</ref> The Qing tried to protect aboriginal land claims, but also sought to turn them into tax paying subjects. Chinese and tax paying aborigines were barred from entering the wilderness which covered most of the island for the fear of raising the ire of the non taxpaying, highland aborigines and inciting [[rebellion]]. A border was constructed along the western plain, built using pits and mounds of earth, called \"earth cows\", to discourage [[squatting]].\n\n===Early Han settlers===\nFrom 1683 to around 1760, the Qing government limited immigration to Taiwan. Such restriction was relaxed following the 1760s and by 1811 there were more than two million Chinese immigrants on Taiwan. In 1875 [[Taipeh Prefecture]] was established, under the jurisdiction of Fujian Province. Also, there had been various conflicts between Chinese immigrants. Most conflicts were between Han from Fujian and Han from [[Guangdong]], between people from different areas of Fujian, between Han and [[Hakka people|Hakka]] settlers, or simply between people of different surnames engaged in clan feuds. Because of the strong provincial loyalties held by these immigrants, the Qing government felt Taiwan was somewhat difficult to govern. Taiwan was also plagued by foreign invasions.{{By whom|date=December 2018}}\n\nGiven the strategic and commercial value of Taiwan, there were British suggestions in 1840 and 1841 to seize the island.<ref name=\"Tsai2014\">{{cite book|author=Shih-Shan Henry Tsai|title=Maritime Taiwan: Historical Encounters with the East and the West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vUbfBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA66|date=2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-46517-1|pages=66\u201367}}</ref><ref name=\"Gordon2009\">{{cite book|author=Leonard H.

The brig ''Ann'' also became shipwrecked in March 1842. Most of the crew were Indian [[lascar]]s. Survivors from both ships were transferred by authorities to the capital [[Tainan]]. The Taiwan Qing commanders, Ta-hung-ah and Yao Ying, filed a disingenuous report to the emperor, claiming to have defended against an attack from the Keelung fort. In October 1841, [[HMS Nimrod (1828)|HMS ''Nimrod'']] sailed to Keelung to search for the ''Nerbudda'' survivors, but after Captain Joseph Pearse found out that they were sent south for imprisonment, he ordered the bombardment of the harbour and destroyed 27 sets of cannon before returning to Hong Kong. Most of the survivors\u2014over 130 from the ''Nerbudda'' and 54 from the ''Ann''\u2014were [[Nerbudda incident|executed in Tainan]] in August 1842.<ref name=\"Tsai2014\" />\n\nThe Aboriginals often slaughtered the shipwrecked crews of Western ships. In 1867 the entire American crew of the ''Rover'' were massacred by aboriginals in the [[Rover incident|''Rover'' incident]]. When the Americans launched the punitive [[Formosa Expedition]] in retaliation, the aboriginals defeated the Americans and forced them to retreat, killing an American marine while suffering no casualties themselves.\n\nDuring the [[Sino-French War]], the French attempted an invasion of Taiwan during the [[Keelung Campaign]] in 1884. [[Liu Mingchuan]], who was leading the defense of Taiwan, recruited Aboriginals to serve alongside the Chinese soldiers in fighting against the French. The French were defeated at the [[Battle of Tamsui]] and the Qing forces pinned the French down at Keelung in an eight-month-long campaign before the French withdrew. Because of these incursions, the Qing government began constructing a series of coastal defenses and in 1885, work commenced to make Taiwan a province, with Liu Mingchuan serving as the first governor. He divided Taiwan into eleven counties and tried to improve relations with the aborigines. He also developed a railway from [[Taipei]] to [[Hsinchu]], established a mine in Keelung, and built an arsenal to improve Taiwan's defensive capability against foreigners.\n\nFollowing a shipwreck of a [[Ryukyu Kingdom|Ryukyuan]] vessel on the southeastern tip of Taiwan in winter of 1871, in which the heads of 54 crew members were taken by the aboriginal Taiwanese [[Paiwan people]] in the [[Mudan incident (1871)|Mudan incident]], the Japanese sought to use this incident as a pretext to have the Qing formally acknowledge Japanese sovereignty over the [[Ryukyu Islands]] as Japanese territory and to test reactions to potential expansion into Taiwan. According to records from Japanese documents, {{Interlanguage link multi|Mao Changxi|zh|3=\u6bdb\u6636\u7199}} and {{Interlanguage link multi|Dong Xun|zh|3=\u8463\u6042}}, the [[Qing]] ministers at [[Zongli Yamen]] who handled the complaints from Japanese envoy {{Interlanguage link multi|Yanagihara Sakimitsu|ja|3=\u67f3\u539f\u524d\u5149}}, replied first that they had heard only of a massacre of Ryukyuans, not of Japanese, and quickly noted that Ryukyu was under [[List of tributaries of Imperial China|Chinese suzerainty]], and therefore this issue was not Japan's business. In addition, the governor-general of the Qing province [[Fujian]] had rescued the survivors of the massacre and returned them safely to Ryukyu. The Qing authorities explained that there were two kinds of aborigines on Taiwan: those governed by the Qing, and those unnaturalized \"raw barbarians&nbsp;... beyond the reach of Qing government and customs.\" They indirectly hinted that foreigners traveling in those areas settled by indigenous people must exercise caution.\n\nAfter the Yanagihara-Yamen interview, the Japanese took their explanation to mean that the Qing government had not opposed Japan's claims to sovereignty over the Ryukyu Islands, disclaimed any jurisdiction over Aboriginal Taiwanese, and had indeed consented to Japan's expedition to Taiwan.{{sfnp|Leung|1983|p=270}} The Qing dynasty made it clear to the Japanese that Taiwan was definitely within Qing jurisdiction, even though part of that island's aboriginal population was not yet under the influence of Chinese culture. The Qing also pointed to similar cases all over the world where an aboriginal population within a national boundary was not completely [[Subjugated mentality|subjugated]] by the [[dominant culture]] of that country.\n\nThe Japanese nevertheless launched [[Taiwan Expedition of 1874|an expedition]] to Mutan village with a force of 3600 soldiers in 1874. The number of killed [[Paiwan people|Paiwan]] was about thirty, and that for the Japanese was six. Eventually, the Japanese withdrew after being paid a massive [[indemnity]] by the Qing. This incident caused the Qing to re-think the importance of Taiwan in their maritime defense strategy and greater importance was placed on gaining control over the wilderness regions.\n\nOn the eve of the [[First Sino-Japanese War]], about 45 percent of the island was administered under direct Qing administration while the remaining was lightly populated by [[Taiwanese aborigines|Aborigines]].{{sfnp|Morris|2002|pp=5\u20136}} In a population of around 2.5 million, about 2.3 million were [[Han Chinese]] and the remaining two hundred thousand were classified as members of various indigenous tribes.\n\n===End of Qing Rule===\n[[Image:1896 map of Taiwan.png|thumb|250px|1896 map of Formosa, revised by Rev.

Some were goaded by [[Chinese nationalism]], while others contained nascent Taiwanese self-determination.{{sfnp|Zhang|1998|p=514}} Rebellions were often caused by a combination of the effects of unequal colonial policies on local elites and extant [[Millenarianism|millenarian]] beliefs of the local Taiwanese and plains Aborigines. Aboriginal resistance to the heavy-handed Japanese policies of acculturation and pacification lasted up until the early 1930s.{{sfnp|Katz|2005}} The last major Aboriginal rebellion, the [[Musha Incident|Musha (Wushe) Uprising]] in late 1930 by the [[Atayal people]] angry over their treatment while laboring in the burdensome job of [[camphor]] extraction, launched the last headhunting party in which over 150 Japanese officials were killed and beheaded during the opening ceremonies of a school.

Some felt that the safety of personal life and property was of utmost importance and went along with the Japanese colonial authorities. The second group of Taiwanese were eager to become imperial subjects, believing that such action would lead to equal status with Japanese nationals. The third group was influenced by [[Taiwan independence]] and tried to get rid of the Japanese colonials to establish a native Taiwanese rule. The fourth group on the other hand were influenced by [[Chinese nationalism]] and fought for the return of Taiwan to Chinese rule. From 1897 onwards, this last group staged many rebellions, the most famous one being led by {{Interlanguage link multi|Luo Fuxing|zh|3=\u7f85\u798f\u661f}}, who was arrested and executed along with two hundred of his comrades in 1913.

The [[Bank of Taiwan]] was established in 1899 to encourage Japanese [[private sector]]s, including [[Mitsubishi]] and the [[Mitsui|Mitsui Group]], to invest in Taiwan. In 1900, the third [[Governor-General of Taiwan]] passed a budget which initiated the building of [[Rail transport in Taiwan|Taiwan's railroad system]] from Kirun ([[Keelung]]) to Takao ([[Kaohsiung]]). By 1905 the island had electric power supplied by water power in [[Sun-Moon Lake]], and in subsequent years Taiwan was considered the second-most developed region of East Asia (after Japan). By 1905, Taiwan was financially self-sufficient and had been weaned off of subsidies from Japan's central government.\n\nUnder the governor [[Shimpei Goto]]'s rule, many major public works projects were completed. The [[Rail transport in Taiwan|Taiwan rail system]] connecting the south and the north and the modernizations of Kirun ([[Keelung]]) and Takao ([[Kaohsiung]]) ports were completed to facilitate transport and shipping of raw material and agricultural products.{{sfnp|Takekoshi|1907}} Exports increased by fourfold. 55% of agricultural land was covered by dam-supported [[irrigation]] systems. Food production had increased fourfold and [[Sugarcane|sugar cane]] production had increased 15-fold between 1895 and 1925 and Taiwan became a major foodbasket serving Japan's industrial economy. A health care system was widely established and [[infectious diseases]] were almost completely eradicated.

He expressed his admiration about the efficiency of Japanese government in developing Taiwan, and commented on how lucky the Taiwanese were to live under such effective administration. Somewhat ironically, Chen Yi would later become the ROC's first Chief Executive of Taiwan, who would be infamous for the corruption that occurred under his watch.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nThe later period of Japanese rule saw a local elite educated and organized. During the 1930s several home rule groups were created at a time when others around the world sought to end colonialism. In 1935, the Taiwanese elected their first group of local legislators. By March 1945, the Japanese legislative branch hastily modified election laws to allow Taiwanese representation in the [[Japanese Diet]].{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:Takasago Volunteer Corps.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Takasago Volunteers]] were a unit of the Japanese Army recruited from Taiwanese aboriginal tribes.]]\nAs Japan embarked on [[Japanese invasion of China|full-scale war in China]] in 1937, it expanded Taiwan's industrial capacity to manufacture war material. By 1939, industrial production had exceeded agricultural production in Taiwan. At the same time, the \"[[K\u014dminka movement (Taiwan)|''k\u014dminka'']]\" imperialization project was put under way to instill the \"Japanese Spirit\" in Taiwanese residents, and ensure the Taiwanese would remain loyal subjects of the Japanese Emperor ready to make sacrifices during wartime. Measures including Japanese-language education, the option of adopting Japanese names, and the worship of Japanese religion were instituted. In 1943, 94% of the children received 6-year compulsory education. From 1937 to 1945, 126,750 Taiwanese joined and served in the [[Imperial Japanese Army|military of the Japanese Empire]], while a further 80,433 were conscripted between 1942 and 1945. Of the sum total, 30,304, or 15%, died in [[Japan in World War II|Japan's war in Asia]].\n\nThe [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] operated heavily out of Taiwan. The \"[[The Japanese Navy Taiwan and South Pacific Mandate political project|South Strike Group]]\" was based out of the [[Taihoku Imperial University]] (now National Taiwan University) in Taiwan. Many of the Japanese forces participating in the [[Aerial Battle of Taiwan-Okinawa]] were based in Taiwan. Important Japanese military bases and industrial centers throughout Taiwan, like [[Takao, Taiwan|Takao]] (now Kaohsiung), were targets of heavy American bombing.\n\nIn 1942, after the United States entered the war against Japan and on the side of China, the Chinese government under the [[KMT]] renounced all treaties signed with Japan before that date and made Taiwan's return to China (as with [[Manchuria]], ruled as the Japanese [[Puppet States of WWII|wartime puppet state]] of \"[[Manchukuo]]\") one of the wartime objectives. In the [[1943 Cairo Declaration|Cairo Declaration]] of 1943, the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]] declared the return of [[Taiwan (island)|Taiwan]] (including the [[Pescadores]]) to the Republic of China as one of several Allied demands. In 1945, Japan unconditionally surrendered with signing of the [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender|instrument of surrender]] and ended its rule in Taiwan as the territory was put under the administrative control of the Republic of China government in 1945 by the [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration]].<ref name=\"unhcr.org\">{{cite web |url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,,,TWN,,4954ce6323,0.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728144641/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,,,TWN,,4954ce6323,0.html |archivedate=2011-07-28 }} UNHCR</ref><ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2013/06/09/2003564336\n|title=CIA report shows Taiwan concerns\n|work=Taipei Times |date=9 Jun 2013 |page=1 |last=Lowther |first=William\n|quote=[Quoting from a declassified CIA report on Taiwan written in March 1949] From the legal standpoint, Taiwan is not part of the Republic of China.

Anti-[[Mainland Chinese|mainlander]] violence flared on February 28, 1947, prompted by an incident in which a cigarette seller was injured and a passerby was indiscriminately shot dead by Nationalist authorities.{{sfnp|Kerr|1966|pp=254\u2013255}} During the ensuing crackdown by the KMT administration in what became known as the [[February 28 Incident]], tens of thousands of people were killed or arrested, and the incident became a [[taboo]] topic of discussion for the entire [[martial law]] era.\n\nFrom the 1930s onward the [[Chinese Civil War]] was underway in mainland China between [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s ROC government and the [[Communist Party of China]] led by [[Mao Zedong]]. When the Communists gained complete control of Mainland China in 1949, two million refugees, predominantly from the Nationalist government, military, and business community, [[Chinese Nationalist Party retreat to Taiwan|fled to Taiwan]]. On October 1, 1949 the [[People's Republic of China]] (P.R.C.) was founded in mainland China by the victorious communists; several months before, Chiang Kai-shek had established a provisional ROC capital in [[Taipei]] and moved his government there from [[Nanjing]]. Under Nationalist rule, the mainlanders dominated the government and civil services.{{sfnp|Gates|1981}}\n\n{{See also|Chinese Nationalist Party retreat to Taiwan}}\n\n===Economic development===\n[[Image:Taiwan-1M-Yuan.jpg|thumb|80px|The [[Chinese Civil War]] led to severe inflation. Currency was issued in denominations of 1 million [[Old Taiwan dollar]]s.]]\nIn the immediate aftermath of World War II, post-war economic conditions compounded with the then-ongoing [[Chinese Civil War]] caused severe [[inflation]] across mainland China and in Taiwan, made worse by disastrous currency reforms and corruption. This gave way to the reconstruction process and new reforms.\n\nThe KMT took control of Taiwan's monopolies that had been owned by the Japanese prior to World War II. They nationalized approximately 17% of Taiwan's [[GNP]] and voided Japanese bond certificates held by Taiwanese investors.{{sfnp|Singh|2010|p=50}} These real estate holdings as well as American aid such as the [[China Aid Act]] and the [[Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction]] helped to ensure that Taiwan would recover quickly from war. The Kuomintang government also moved the entire [[official gold reserves|gold reserve]] from the Chinese mainland to Taiwan,{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} and used this reserve to back the newly issued [[New Taiwan dollar]] to stabilize the new currency and put a stop to [[hyperinflation]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Shih-hui|date=2005|title=The Currency Conversion in Postwar Taiwan: Gold Standard from 1949 to 1950|journal=The Kyoto Economic Review|volume=74|issue=2 (157)|pages=191\u2013203|jstor=43213319|issn=1349-6786}}</ref>\n\nThe KMT authorities implemented a far-reaching and highly successful [[land reform]] program on Taiwan during the 1950s. The [[375 Rent Reduction Act]] alleviated tax burden on peasants and another act redistributed land among small farmers and compensated large landowners with commodities certificates and stock in state-owned industries. Although this left some large landowners impoverished, others turned their compensation into capital and started commercial and industrial enterprises. These entrepreneurs were to become Taiwan's first [[Industrial capitalism|industrial capitalists]]. Together with businessmen who fled from mainland China, they once again revived Taiwan's prosperity previously ceased along with Japanese withdrawal and managed Taiwan's transition from an agricultural to a commercial, industrial economy.\n\nFrom 1950 to 1965, Taiwan received a total of $1.5 billion in economic aid and $2.4 billion in military aid from the United States. In 1965 all American aid ceased when Taiwan had established a solid financial base.{{sfnp|Chan|1997}} Having accomplished that, [[President of the Republic of China|ROC president]] [[Chiang Ching-kuo]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://taiwanpedia.culture.tw/en/content?ID=3933 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-07-19 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130419042325/http://taiwanpedia.culture.tw/en/content?ID=3933 |archive-date=2013-04-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref> (the son of [[Chiang Kai-shek]]) started state projects such as the [[Ten Major Construction Projects]] that provided the infrastructure for building a strong export-driven economy. Taiwan has developed steadily into a major international trading power with more than $218 billion in two-way trade and one of the highest [[foreign exchange reserves]] in the world. Tremendous prosperity on the island was accompanied by economic and social stability. Taiwan's phenomenal economic development earned it a spot as one of the [[Four Asian Tigers]].\n\n=== Democratic reforms ===\nUntil the early 1970s, the Republic of China was recognized as the sole legitimate government of China by the United Nations and most Western nations; who refused to recognize the [[People's Republic of China]] on account of the [[Cold War]]. The KMT ruled Taiwan under [[martial law]] until the late 1980s, with the stated goal of being vigilant against Communist infiltration and preparing to retake mainland China. Therefore, political dissent was not tolerated.\n\nThe late 1970s and early 1980s were a turbulent time for Chinese people born in Taiwan, as many of the people who had originally been oppressed and left behind by economic changes became members of the Taiwan's new middle class. Free enterprise had allowed native Taiwanese to gain a powerful bargaining chip in their demands for respect for their basic human rights. The [[Kaohsiung Incident]] would be a major turning point for democracy in Taiwan.\n\nTaiwan also faced setbacks in the international sphere. In 1971, the ROC government walked out of the United Nations shortly before it recognized the PRC government in Beijing as the legitimate holder of China's seat in the United Nations. The ROC had been offered dual representation,{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} but Chiang Kai-shek demanded to retain a seat on the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]], which was not acceptable to the PRC.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} Chiang expressed his decision in his famous \"[[the sky is not big enough for two suns]]\" speech.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018|reason=Text of this speech should be linked}} In October 1971, [[China and the United Nations|Resolution 2758]] was passed by the UN General Assembly and \"the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek\" (and thus the ROC) were expelled from the UN and replaced as \"China\" by the PRC. In 1979, the United States switched recognition from Taipei to Beijing.\n\nChiang Kai-shek died in April 1975, and was succeeded to the presidency by [[Yen Chia-kan]] while his son [[Chiang Ching-kuo]] succeeded to the leadership of the Kuomintang (opting to take the title \"Chairman\" rather than the elder Chiang's title of \"Director-General\"). Formerly the head of the feared [[secret police]], Chiang Ching-kuo recognized gaining foreign support to securing the ROC's future security required reform. His administration saw a gradual loosening of political controls, a transition towards democracy, and moves toward [[Taiwanization]] of the regime.{{sfnp|Hu|2005|pp=26\u201327}} Opponents of the Nationalists were no longer forbidden to hold meetings or publish papers. Though opposition political parties were still illegal, when the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] was established as the first opposition party in 1986, President Chiang decided against dissolving the group or persecuting its leaders. Its candidates officially ran in elections as independents in the [[Tangwai movement]]. In the following year, Chiang ended martial law and allowed family visits to [[mainland China]].{{sfnp|Hu|2005|pp=32\u201343}} Chiang selected [[Lee Teng-hui]], a Taiwan born technocrat to be his vice president; the first in the line of succession to the presidency. The move followed other reforms giving more power to native born citizens and calmed anti-KMT sentiments.{{sfnp|Hu|2005|pp=33\u201334}}\n\nAfter Chiang Ching-kuo died in 1988, his successor, President [[Lee Teng-hui]], continued to democratize the government. Lee transferred more government authority to Taiwanese born citizens, and Taiwan underwent a process of [[Taiwanization]]. In this localization process, local culture and history was promoted over a pan-China viewpoint. Lee's reforms included printing banknotes from the Central Bank instead of the usual Provincial Bank of Taiwan. He also largely suspended the operation of the [[Taiwan Provincial Government]]. In 1991 the [[Legislative Yuan]] and [[National Assembly (Republic of China)|National Assembly]] elected in 1947 were forced to resign. These groups were originally created to represent mainland China constituencies. The restrictions on the use of [[Languages of Taiwan|Taiwanese languages]] in the broadcast media and in schools were also lifted.\n\nHowever, Lee failed to crack down on the massive corruption that pervaded the government and many KMT loyalists felt that Lee betrayed the ROC by taking reforms too far, while those in the opposition felt he did not take reforms far enough.\n\n===Democratic period===\nLee ran as the incumbent in Taiwan's first direct [[1996 Republic of China presidential election|presidential election in 1996]] against DPP candidate and former dissident, Peng Min-ming. This election prompted the PRC to conduct a series of missile tests in the [[Taiwan Strait]] to intimidate the Taiwanese electorate so that electorates would vote for other pro-unification candidates, [[Chen Li-an]] and [[Lin Yang-kang]]. The aggressive tactic prompted U.S. President [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] to invoke the [[Taiwan Relations Act]] and dispatch two aircraft carrier battle groups into the region off Taiwan's southern coast to monitor the situation, and PRC's missile tests were forced to end earlier than planned. This incident is known as the [[Third Taiwan Strait Crisis|1996 Taiwan Straits Crisis]].{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nOne of Lee's final acts as president was to declare on German radio that the ROC and the PRC have a [[Special state-to-state relations|special state to state relationship]]. Lee's statement was met with the PRC's People's Army conducting military drills in Fujian and a frightening island-wide [[Power outage|blackout]] in Taiwan, causing many to fear an attack or cyberattack.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe [[2000 ROC presidential election|2000 presidential election]] marked the end of the Kuomintang (KMT) rule. DPP candidate [[Chen Shui-bian]] won a three-way race that saw the [[Pan-Blue]] vote split by independent [[James Soong]] (formerly of the Kuomintang) and Kuomintang candidate [[Lien Chan]]. Chen garnered 39% of the vote.<ref>Asia Society, \"Opposition Wins Taiwan Election,\" (2000)</ref> After the election, Soong formed the [[People First Party (Republic of China)|People First Party]] (PFP).{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n[[2004 Taiwan presidential election|In 2004]], President Chen was re-elected to a second four-year term after an assassination attempt which occurred the day before the election. Two shots were fired, with one bullet grazing the President's belly after penetrating the windshield of a jeep and several layers of clothing and the other bullet penetrated the windshield and hitting the vice president's knee cast. (She was wearing a knee cast due to an earlier injury.) Police investigators have said that the most likely suspect is believed to have been [[Chen Yi-hsiung]], who was later found dead.<ref>Reuters, \"Taiwan election shooting suspect dead,\" (2005)</ref> Their injuries were not life-threatening, but the incident is believed by Pan-Blue to have gained them enough sympathy to influence the result.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nThat incident might also have given president Chen the ability to declare a state of emergency and martial law, which allegedly prevented the police and military, which were strongly Pan-Blue,{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} from voting. Lien refused to concede, alleging voting irregularities. Kuomintang and PFP supporters held mass protests throughout the following weeks. Subsequently, Kuomintang and PFP took the case to the court. The [[High Court of Taiwan|High Court]] ordered a recount and found no evidence to support the accusation made by Kuomintang and PFP. The Court decided that the election result was legitimate and valid.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nDuring the [[2004 Taiwan legislative election|legislative elections]] held on December 8, 2004, the Kuomintang-PFP dominated Pan-Blue alliance gained a slim majority in the elections which resulted in President Chen resigning as DPP chairman. The cabinet of Premier [[Yu Shyi-kun]] resigned, and [[Frank Hsieh]] assumed premiership on January 25, 2005.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn a move that some{{Who|date=December 2018}} saw as a reaction to Chen's re-election, the People's Republic of China enacted a proposed [[National Unification Promotion Law of the People's Republic of China (proposed)|anti-secession law]] that allows the [[use of force]] on Taiwan and the Republic of China government if it formally declares independence. However, this law was met with overwhelming protest from nearly all political parties and public figures of the Republic of China and disapproval from the western countries. Negotiations in January in [[Macau]] between the aviation authorities from both the Republic of China and People's Republic of China resulted in direct [[Cross-Strait charter|cross-strait charter flights]] between mainland China and Taiwan during the [[Chinese New Year|Chinese Lunar New Year]] Period.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn a twist of events, President Chen and PFP Chairman Soong held a summit and the independence-leaning president indicated that eventual [[Chinese unification|reunification with mainland China]] would be an option. Against the anti-secession law proposed by the People's Republic of China, President Chen held a video conference with the [[European Parliament]] in [[Brussels]] urging the [[European Union]] not to lift the arms embargo on the People's Republic of China.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nDomestic politics during the Chen administration were largely a political stalemate as the Kuomintang and PFP together held a pan-Blue majority in the legislature. Among the many items that made little progress due to the political stalemate were a stalled arms procurement bill, which would have advanced defense capabilities of the Republic of China through the purchase of weaponry, such as sub-hunting [[P-3 Orion]]s, from the US government, and banking reform legislation, which would have helped in the consolidation of the many banks in the Republic of China, none of which hold even 10% shares of the local market. The [[president of the Republic of China]], unlike the president of the United States, does not wield [[veto power]], providing him with little to no leverage in negotiating with an opposition legislature, regardless of how slim the majority.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe constitution was [[Additional Articles of the Constitution of the Republic of China|further amended]] in 2005, creating a two-vote electoral system, with [[single member plurality]] seats and [[proportional representation|proportional representative]] seats, and abolishing the National Assembly, transferring most of its former powers to the [[Legislative Yuan]], and leaving further amendment voting to public referendums. The issue of formally declaring the [[Taiwan independence|independence of Taiwan]] is also a constant constitutional question. Arms purchases from the United States are still a controversial political question, with the [[Pan-Green Coalition]] camp favoring the purchase, and the [[Pan-Blue Coalition]] opposing it.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\nRecent allegations about [[political corruption|corruption]] inside the [[First Family]] had led to three [[Recall election|recall motions]] votes in the [[Legislative Yuan]] aimed at ousting President [[Chen Shui-bian]]. All of them had failed since the Pan-Blue Coalition lacked the [[two-thirds majority]] required to complete the process and the [[political parties]] voted according to political lines. The [[First Lady]], [[Wu Shu-chen]] was prosecuted for corruption, namely illegally using state funds for personal reasons.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe president faced similar accusations as his wife, but was protected from prosecution by presidential [[Legal immunity|immunity]]. He had promised to resign if his wife was found guilty. However, after his wife fainted in the preparation hearing, she had sought and obtained absence of leave from the Court 16 times citing health concerns before President Chen Shui-bian's term was complete.<ref>[http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/national%20news/2008/09/18/175153/Former-first.htm Former first lady Wu to appear in court], ''China Post''</ref>\n\nIn December 2006, municipal and mayoral elections were held in [[Taipei]] and [[Kaohsiung]]. The [[KMT]] retained a clear majority in the capital, while the [[Democratic Progressive Party|DPP]] and the KMT obtained very close results in the southern city of [[Kaohsiung]]. [[Huang Chun-ying]] lost to [[Chen Chu]] by a margin of 0.14 percent; 378,303 votes to 379,417 votes, making [[Chen Chu]] the first female mayor of a [[Special municipality (Taiwan)|special municipality]] in the Republic of China. In 2007, the ROC applied for membership in the United Nations under the name \"Taiwan\", and was rejected by the General Assembly.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn 2007, President Chen proposed a policy of [[Four Wants and One Without]], which in substance states that Taiwan wants independence; Taiwan wants the rectification of its name; Taiwan wants a new constitution; Taiwan wants development; and Taiwanese politics is without [[Left\u2013right political spectrum|the question of left or right]], but only the question of [[Chinese unification|unification]] or [[Taiwan independence movement|independence]]. The reception of this proposed policy in Taiwanese general public was unclear. It, however, was met with a cold reception by both the PRC and the United States. The PRC Foreign Minister emphasised that the [[Anti-Secession Law]] was not a piece of [[Unenforceable|unenforceable legislation]], while the US Department of State spokesman Sean McCormack described Chen's policy as \"unhelpful\".<ref>{{cite web | title=US Says Taiwanese President's Independence Remarks 'Unhelpful'|date=2007-03-05 | publisher=Voice of America | url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/taiwan/2007/taiwan-070305-voa02.htm}}</ref>\n\nThe KMT also retained control of the legislature in the [[2008 Republic of China legislative election|Legislative Yuan elections in January 2008]].

The Spanish built a [[Spanish Formosa|settlement in the north]] for a brief period but were driven out by the Dutch in 1642.\n\nIn 1662, [[Koxinga]], a loyalist of the [[Ming dynasty]] who had lost control of mainland China in 1644, defeated the Dutch and established a [[Kingdom of Tungning|base of operations]] on the island. His forces were defeated by the [[Qing dynasty]] in 1683, and parts of Taiwan became increasingly [[Taiwan under Qing rule|integrated into the Qing empire]]. Following the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] in 1895, the Qing [[1895 Japanese Conquest of Taiwan|ceded the island]], along with [[Penghu]], to the [[Empire of Japan]]. Taiwan produced rice and sugar to be exported to the Empire of Japan, and also served as a base for the [[South-East Asian theatre of World War II|Japanese invasion of Southeast Asia]] and [[Pacific War|the Pacific]] during World War II. [[Education in the Empire of Japan|Japanese imperial education]] was implemented in [[Taiwan]] and many Taiwanese also fought for Japan during the war.\n\nIn 1945, following the end of [[World War II]], the [[nationalist government]] of the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] (ROC), led by the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT), took control of Taiwan. In 1949, after losing control of [[mainland China]] in the [[Chinese Civil War]], the ROC government under the KMT [[Chinese Nationalist Party retreat to Taiwan|withdrew to Taiwan]] and [[Chiang Kai-shek]] declared [[martial law]]. The KMT ruled Taiwan (along with the Islands of Kinmen, [[Wuqiu, Kinmen|Wuqiu]] and the Matsu on the opposite side of the [[Taiwan Strait]]) as a [[single-party state]] for forty years, until democratic reforms in the 1980s, which led to the first-ever [[1996 Republic of China presidential election|direct presidential election]] in 1996. During the post-war period, Taiwan experienced rapid industrialization and economic growth known as the \"[[Taiwan Miracle]]\", and was known as one of the \"[[Four Asian Tigers]]\".\n\n==From prehistory until the 16th century==\n{{Main|Prehistory of Taiwan}}\n{{location map+|Taiwan|caption=Taiwan, with early sites, and the {{convert|abbr=on|130|km|mi|adj=mid|-wide|0}} Taiwan Strait|AlternativeMap=Taiwan relief location map.png|width=200|float=right|places=\n  {{location map~|Taiwan|lat_deg=26.338889|lon_deg=120.22|position=bottom|label_size=75|mark=Brown pog.svg|label=Liang Island}}\n  {{location map~|Taiwan|lat_deg=23.02|lon_deg=120.42|position=left|label_size=75|mark=Brown pog.svg|label=Zuojhen}}\n  {{location map~|Taiwan|lat_deg=23.32|lon_deg=121.45|position=bottom|label_size=75|mark=Brown pog.svg|label=Changbin}}\n  {{location map~|Taiwan|lat_deg=21.9|lon_deg=120.85|position=right|label_size=75|mark=Brown pog.svg|label=Eluanbi}}\n  {{location map~|Taiwan|lat_deg=25.15|lon_deg=121.4|position=top|label_size=75|mark=Orange pog.svg|label=Dapenkeng}}\n}}\nIn the [[Late Pleistocene]], sea levels were about 140 m lower than in the present day, exposing the floor of the shallow [[Taiwan Strait]] as a land bridge that was crossed by mainland fauna.{{sfnp|Chang|1989}} The oldest evidence of human presence on Taiwan consists of three cranial fragments and a molar tooth found at Chouqu and Gangzilin, in [[Zuojhen District]], Tainan.

This measure largely backfired, and between 1662 and 1664, six major waves of immigration occurred from these coastal towns to Taiwan, spurred by the severe hardships incurred from the Qing relocation policy.

The point of the campaign had been to destroy the Zheng-family regime, not to conquer the island.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} The Kangxi Emperor expressed the sentiment that Taiwan was \"the size of a pellet; taking it is no gain; not taking it is no loss\" (\u5f48\u4e38\u4e4b\u5730\u3002\u5f97\u4e4b\u7121\u6240\u52a0\uff0c\u4e0d\u5f97\u7121\u6240\u640d).

In 1887, the island was declared as a separate [[Taiwan Province#Qing Dynasty|Fokien-Taiwan Province]].\n\nThe Qing authorities tried to limit immigration to Taiwan and barred families from traveling to Taiwan to ensure the immigrants would return to their families and ancestral graves.

A border was constructed along the western plain, built using pits and mounds of earth, called \"earth cows\", to discourage [[squatting]].\n\n===Early Han settlers===\nFrom 1683 to around 1760, the Qing government limited immigration to Taiwan. Such restriction was relaxed following the 1760s and by 1811 there were more than two million Chinese immigrants on Taiwan. In 1875 [[Taipeh Prefecture]] was established, under the jurisdiction of Fujian Province. Also, there had been various conflicts between Chinese immigrants. Most conflicts were between Han from Fujian and Han from [[Guangdong]], between people from different areas of Fujian, between Han and [[Hakka people|Hakka]] settlers, or simply between people of different surnames engaged in clan feuds. Because of the strong provincial loyalties held by these immigrants, the Qing government felt Taiwan was somewhat difficult to govern. Taiwan was also plagued by foreign invasions.{{By whom|date=December 2018}}\n\nGiven the strategic and commercial value of Taiwan, there were British suggestions in 1840 and 1841 to seize the island.<ref name=\"Tsai2014\">{{cite book|author=Shih-Shan Henry Tsai|title=Maritime Taiwan: Historical Encounters with the East and the West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vUbfBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA66|date=2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-46517-1|pages=66\u201367}}</ref><ref name=\"Gordon2009\">{{cite book|author=Leonard H.

The brig ''Ann'' also became shipwrecked in March 1842. Most of the crew were Indian [[lascar]]s. Survivors from both ships were transferred by authorities to the capital [[Tainan]]. The Taiwan Qing commanders, Ta-hung-ah and Yao Ying, filed a disingenuous report to the emperor, claiming to have defended against an attack from the Keelung fort. In October 1841, [[HMS Nimrod (1828)|HMS ''Nimrod'']] sailed to Keelung to search for the ''Nerbudda'' survivors, but after Captain Joseph Pearse found out that they were sent south for imprisonment, he ordered the bombardment of the harbour and destroyed 27 sets of cannon before returning to Hong Kong.

In 1867 the entire American crew of the ''Rover'' were massacred by aboriginals in the [[Rover incident|''Rover'' incident]]. When the Americans launched the punitive [[Formosa Expedition]] in retaliation, the aboriginals defeated the Americans and forced them to retreat, killing an American marine while suffering no casualties themselves.\n\nDuring the [[Sino-French War]], the French attempted an invasion of Taiwan during the [[Keelung Campaign]] in 1884. [[Liu Mingchuan]], who was leading the defense of Taiwan, recruited Aboriginals to serve alongside the Chinese soldiers in fighting against the French. The French were defeated at the [[Battle of Tamsui]] and the Qing forces pinned the French down at Keelung in an eight-month-long campaign before the French withdrew. Because of these incursions, the Qing government began constructing a series of coastal defenses and in 1885, work commenced to make Taiwan a province, with Liu Mingchuan serving as the first governor. He divided Taiwan into eleven counties and tried to improve relations with the aborigines. He also developed a railway from [[Taipei]] to [[Hsinchu]], established a mine in Keelung, and built an arsenal to improve Taiwan's defensive capability against foreigners.\n\nFollowing a shipwreck of a [[Ryukyu Kingdom|Ryukyuan]] vessel on the southeastern tip of Taiwan in winter of 1871, in which the heads of 54 crew members were taken by the aboriginal Taiwanese [[Paiwan people]] in the [[Mudan incident (1871)|Mudan incident]], the Japanese sought to use this incident as a pretext to have the Qing formally acknowledge Japanese sovereignty over the [[Ryukyu Islands]] as Japanese territory and to test reactions to potential expansion into Taiwan. According to records from Japanese documents, {{Interlanguage link multi|Mao Changxi|zh|3=\u6bdb\u6636\u7199}} and {{Interlanguage link multi|Dong Xun|zh|3=\u8463\u6042}}, the [[Qing]] ministers at [[Zongli Yamen]] who handled the complaints from Japanese envoy {{Interlanguage link multi|Yanagihara Sakimitsu|ja|3=\u67f3\u539f\u524d\u5149}}, replied first that they had heard only of a massacre of Ryukyuans, not of Japanese, and quickly noted that Ryukyu was under [[List of tributaries of Imperial China|Chinese suzerainty]], and therefore this issue was not Japan's business. In addition, the governor-general of the Qing province [[Fujian]] had rescued the survivors of the massacre and returned them safely to Ryukyu. The Qing authorities explained that there were two kinds of aborigines on Taiwan: those governed by the Qing, and those unnaturalized \"raw barbarians&nbsp;... beyond the reach of Qing government and customs.\" They indirectly hinted that foreigners traveling in those areas settled by indigenous people must exercise caution.\n\nAfter the Yanagihara-Yamen interview, the Japanese took their explanation to mean that the Qing government had not opposed Japan's claims to sovereignty over the Ryukyu Islands, disclaimed any jurisdiction over Aboriginal Taiwanese, and had indeed consented to Japan's expedition to Taiwan.{{sfnp|Leung|1983|p=270}} The Qing dynasty made it clear to the Japanese that Taiwan was definitely within Qing jurisdiction, even though part of that island's aboriginal population was not yet under the influence of Chinese culture. The Qing also pointed to similar cases all over the world where an aboriginal population within a national boundary was not completely [[Subjugated mentality|subjugated]] by the [[dominant culture]] of that country.\n\nThe Japanese nevertheless launched [[Taiwan Expedition of 1874|an expedition]] to Mutan village with a force of 3600 soldiers in 1874. The number of killed [[Paiwan people|Paiwan]] was about thirty, and that for the Japanese was six. Eventually, the Japanese withdrew after being paid a massive [[indemnity]] by the Qing. This incident caused the Qing to re-think the importance of Taiwan in their maritime defense strategy and greater importance was placed on gaining control over the wilderness regions.\n\nOn the eve of the [[First Sino-Japanese War]], about 45 percent of the island was administered under direct Qing administration while the remaining was lightly populated by [[Taiwanese aborigines|Aborigines]].{{sfnp|Morris|2002|pp=5\u20136}} In a population of around 2.5 million, about 2.3 million were [[Han Chinese]] and the remaining two hundred thousand were classified as members of various indigenous tribes.\n\n===End of Qing Rule===\n[[Image:1896 map of Taiwan.png|thumb|250px|1896 map of Formosa, revised by Rev.

To the west, [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592\u20131598)|Japan invaded Korea]] in that time period, with the eventual conquest of China contemplated.

The [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] was signed on April 17, 1895, ceding Taiwan and [[Penghu|the Penghu Islands]] to Japan, which would rule the island for 50 years until its defeat in World War II.\n[[File:Soldiers of the Japanese expedition in Taiwan.jpg|thumb|left|Soldiers of the 1874 expedition in Taiwan]]\nAfter receiving sovereignty of Taiwan, the Japanese feared military [[1895 Japanese Conquest of Taiwan|resistance]] from Taiwanese who followed the establishment by the local elite of the short-lived [[Republic of Formosa]]. Taiwan's elite hoped that by declaring themselves a republic the world would not stand by and allow a [[sovereign state]] to be invaded by the Japanese, and therefore allied with the Qing. The plan quickly turned to chaos as standard Green troops{{Clarify|reason=|date=December 2018}} and [[Yue people|ethnic Yue]] soldiers took to looting and pillaging Taiwan. Given the choice between chaos at the hands of Chinese or submission to the Japanese, the Taipei elite sent [[Koo Hsien-jung]] to [[Keelung]] to invite the advancing Japanese forces to proceed to Taipei and restore order.{{sfnp|Morris|2002|pp=4\u201318}}\n[[File:Map of Taiwan 1901.jpg|thumb|right|1901 map with red line marking approximate boundary separating territory under actual Japanese administration from \"Savage District\"]]\nArmed resistance was sporadic, yet at times fierce, but was largely crushed by 1902, although relatively minor rebellions occurred in subsequent years, including the [[Ta-pa-ni Incident|Ta-pa-ni incident]] of 1915 in [[Tainan County]].{{sfnp|Katz|2005}} [[Nonviolent resistance|Nonviolent means of resistance]] began to take place of armed rebellions and the most prominent organization was the [[Taiwanese Cultural Association]], founded in 1921. Taiwanese resistance was caused by several different factors (e.g., the [[Taish\u014d Democracy]]). Some were goaded by [[Chinese nationalism]], while others contained nascent Taiwanese self-determination.{{sfnp|Zhang|1998|p=514}} Rebellions were often caused by a combination of the effects of unequal colonial policies on local elites and extant [[Millenarianism|millenarian]] beliefs of the local Taiwanese and plains Aborigines. Aboriginal resistance to the heavy-handed Japanese policies of acculturation and pacification lasted up until the early 1930s.{{sfnp|Katz|2005}} The last major Aboriginal rebellion, the [[Musha Incident|Musha (Wushe) Uprising]] in late 1930 by the [[Atayal people]] angry over their treatment while laboring in the burdensome job of [[camphor]] extraction, launched the last headhunting party in which over 150 Japanese officials were killed and beheaded during the opening ceremonies of a school. The uprising, led by [[Mona Rudao]], was crushed by 2,000\u20133,000 Japanese troops and Aboriginal auxiliaries with the help of [[poison gas]].{{sfnp|Ching|2001|pp=137\u2013140}}\n\n[[Japanese colonial empire|Japanese colonization]] of the island fell under three stages.

Some felt that the safety of personal life and property was of utmost importance and went along with the Japanese colonial authorities. The second group of Taiwanese were eager to become imperial subjects, believing that such action would lead to equal status with Japanese nationals. The third group was influenced by [[Taiwan independence]] and tried to get rid of the Japanese colonials to establish a native Taiwanese rule. The fourth group on the other hand were influenced by [[Chinese nationalism]] and fought for the return of Taiwan to Chinese rule. From 1897 onwards, this last group staged many rebellions, the most famous one being led by {{Interlanguage link multi|Luo Fuxing|zh|3=\u7f85\u798f\u661f}}, who was arrested and executed along with two hundred of his comrades in 1913.

The [[Bank of Taiwan]] was established in 1899 to encourage Japanese [[private sector]]s, including [[Mitsubishi]] and the [[Mitsui|Mitsui Group]], to invest in Taiwan. In 1900, the third [[Governor-General of Taiwan]] passed a budget which initiated the building of [[Rail transport in Taiwan|Taiwan's railroad system]] from Kirun ([[Keelung]]) to Takao ([[Kaohsiung]]). By 1905 the island had electric power supplied by water power in [[Sun-Moon Lake]], and in subsequent years Taiwan was considered the second-most developed region of East Asia (after Japan). By 1905, Taiwan was financially self-sufficient and had been weaned off of subsidies from Japan's central government.\n\nUnder the governor [[Shimpei Goto]]'s rule, many major public works projects were completed. The [[Rail transport in Taiwan|Taiwan rail system]] connecting the south and the north and the modernizations of Kirun ([[Keelung]]) and Takao ([[Kaohsiung]]) ports were completed to facilitate transport and shipping of raw material and agricultural products.{{sfnp|Takekoshi|1907}} Exports increased by fourfold. 55% of agricultural land was covered by dam-supported [[irrigation]] systems. Food production had increased fourfold and [[Sugarcane|sugar cane]] production had increased 15-fold between 1895 and 1925 and Taiwan became a major foodbasket serving Japan's industrial economy. A health care system was widely established and [[infectious diseases]] were almost completely eradicated. The average lifespan for a Taiwanese resident would become 60 years by 1945.{{sfnp|Kerr|1966}}\n\n[[File:Chiayi City Historical Relic Museum 20060121.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kagi Shrine]], one of many Shinto shrines built in Taiwan.]]\nIn October 1935, the Governor-General of Taiwan held an \"[[The Taiwan Exposition: In Commemoration of the First Forty Years of Colonial Rule|Exposition to Commemorate the 40th Anniversary of the Beginning of Administration in Taiwan]]\", which served as a showcase for the achievements of Taiwan's modernization process under Japanese rule. This attracted worldwide attention, including the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]]'s [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) regime which sent the Japanese-educated [[Chen Yi (Kuomintang)|Chen Yi]] to attend the affair. He expressed his admiration about the efficiency of Japanese government in developing Taiwan, and commented on how lucky the Taiwanese were to live under such effective administration. Somewhat ironically, Chen Yi would later become the ROC's first Chief Executive of Taiwan, who would be infamous for the corruption that occurred under his watch.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nThe later period of Japanese rule saw a local elite educated and organized. During the 1930s several home rule groups were created at a time when others around the world sought to end colonialism. In 1935, the Taiwanese elected their first group of local legislators. By March 1945, the Japanese legislative branch hastily modified election laws to allow Taiwanese representation in the [[Japanese Diet]].{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:Takasago Volunteer Corps.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Takasago Volunteers]] were a unit of the Japanese Army recruited from Taiwanese aboriginal tribes.]]\nAs Japan embarked on [[Japanese invasion of China|full-scale war in China]] in 1937, it expanded Taiwan's industrial capacity to manufacture war material. By 1939, industrial production had exceeded agricultural production in Taiwan. At the same time, the \"[[K\u014dminka movement (Taiwan)|''k\u014dminka'']]\" imperialization project was put under way to instill the \"Japanese Spirit\" in Taiwanese residents, and ensure the Taiwanese would remain loyal subjects of the Japanese Emperor ready to make sacrifices during wartime. Measures including Japanese-language education, the option of adopting Japanese names, and the worship of Japanese religion were instituted. In 1943, 94% of the children received 6-year compulsory education. From 1937 to 1945, 126,750 Taiwanese joined and served in the [[Imperial Japanese Army|military of the Japanese Empire]], while a further 80,433 were conscripted between 1942 and 1945. Of the sum total, 30,304, or 15%, died in [[Japan in World War II|Japan's war in Asia]].\n\nThe [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] operated heavily out of Taiwan. The \"[[The Japanese Navy Taiwan and South Pacific Mandate political project|South Strike Group]]\" was based out of the [[Taihoku Imperial University]] (now National Taiwan University) in Taiwan. Many of the Japanese forces participating in the [[Aerial Battle of Taiwan-Okinawa]] were based in Taiwan. Important Japanese military bases and industrial centers throughout Taiwan, like [[Takao, Taiwan|Takao]] (now Kaohsiung), were targets of heavy American bombing.\n\nIn 1942, after the United States entered the war against Japan and on the side of China, the Chinese government under the [[KMT]] renounced all treaties signed with Japan before that date and made Taiwan's return to China (as with [[Manchuria]], ruled as the Japanese [[Puppet States of WWII|wartime puppet state]] of \"[[Manchukuo]]\") one of the wartime objectives. In the [[1943 Cairo Declaration|Cairo Declaration]] of 1943, the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]] declared the return of [[Taiwan (island)|Taiwan]] (including the [[Pescadores]]) to the Republic of China as one of several Allied demands. In 1945, Japan unconditionally surrendered with signing of the [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender|instrument of surrender]] and ended its rule in Taiwan as the territory was put under the administrative control of the Republic of China government in 1945 by the [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration]].<ref name=\"unhcr.org\">{{cite web |url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,,,TWN,,4954ce6323,0.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728144641/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,,,TWN,,4954ce6323,0.html |archivedate=2011-07-28 }} UNHCR</ref><ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2013/06/09/2003564336\n|title=CIA report shows Taiwan concerns\n|work=Taipei Times |date=9 Jun 2013 |page=1 |last=Lowther |first=William\n|quote=[Quoting from a declassified CIA report on Taiwan written in March 1949] From the legal standpoint, Taiwan is not part of the Republic of China.

The [[375 Rent Reduction Act]] alleviated tax burden on peasants and another act redistributed land among small farmers and compensated large landowners with commodities certificates and stock in state-owned industries.

Taiwan has developed steadily into a major international trading power with more than $218 billion in two-way trade and one of the highest [[foreign exchange reserves]] in the world. Tremendous prosperity on the island was accompanied by economic and social stability. Taiwan's phenomenal economic development earned it a spot as one of the [[Four Asian Tigers]].\n\n=== Democratic reforms ===\nUntil the early 1970s, the Republic of China was recognized as the sole legitimate government of China by the United Nations and most Western nations; who refused to recognize the [[People's Republic of China]] on account of the [[Cold War]]. The KMT ruled Taiwan under [[martial law]] until the late 1980s, with the stated goal of being vigilant against Communist infiltration and preparing to retake mainland China. Therefore, political dissent was not tolerated.\n\nThe late 1970s and early 1980s were a turbulent time for Chinese people born in Taiwan, as many of the people who had originally been oppressed and left behind by economic changes became members of the Taiwan's new middle class. Free enterprise had allowed native Taiwanese to gain a powerful bargaining chip in their demands for respect for their basic human rights. The [[Kaohsiung Incident]] would be a major turning point for democracy in Taiwan.\n\nTaiwan also faced setbacks in the international sphere. In 1971, the ROC government walked out of the United Nations shortly before it recognized the PRC government in Beijing as the legitimate holder of China's seat in the United Nations. The ROC had been offered dual representation,{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} but Chiang Kai-shek demanded to retain a seat on the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]], which was not acceptable to the PRC.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} Chiang expressed his decision in his famous \"[[the sky is not big enough for two suns]]\" speech.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018|reason=Text of this speech should be linked}} In October 1971, [[China and the United Nations|Resolution 2758]] was passed by the UN General Assembly and \"the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek\" (and thus the ROC) were expelled from the UN and replaced as \"China\" by the PRC. In 1979, the United States switched recognition from Taipei to Beijing.\n\nChiang Kai-shek died in April 1975, and was succeeded to the presidency by [[Yen Chia-kan]] while his son [[Chiang Ching-kuo]] succeeded to the leadership of the Kuomintang (opting to take the title \"Chairman\" rather than the elder Chiang's title of \"Director-General\"). Formerly the head of the feared [[secret police]], Chiang Ching-kuo recognized gaining foreign support to securing the ROC's future security required reform. His administration saw a gradual loosening of political controls, a transition towards democracy, and moves toward [[Taiwanization]] of the regime.{{sfnp|Hu|2005|pp=26\u201327}} Opponents of the Nationalists were no longer forbidden to hold meetings or publish papers. Though opposition political parties were still illegal, when the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] was established as the first opposition party in 1986, President Chiang decided against dissolving the group or persecuting its leaders. Its candidates officially ran in elections as independents in the [[Tangwai movement]]. In the following year, Chiang ended martial law and allowed family visits to [[mainland China]].{{sfnp|Hu|2005|pp=32\u201343}} Chiang selected [[Lee Teng-hui]], a Taiwan born technocrat to be his vice president; the first in the line of succession to the presidency. The move followed other reforms giving more power to native born citizens and calmed anti-KMT sentiments.{{sfnp|Hu|2005|pp=33\u201334}}\n\nAfter Chiang Ching-kuo died in 1988, his successor, President [[Lee Teng-hui]], continued to democratize the government. Lee transferred more government authority to Taiwanese born citizens, and Taiwan underwent a process of [[Taiwanization]]. In this localization process, local culture and history was promoted over a pan-China viewpoint. Lee's reforms included printing banknotes from the Central Bank instead of the usual Provincial Bank of Taiwan. He also largely suspended the operation of the [[Taiwan Provincial Government]]. In 1991 the [[Legislative Yuan]] and [[National Assembly (Republic of China)|National Assembly]] elected in 1947 were forced to resign. These groups were originally created to represent mainland China constituencies. The restrictions on the use of [[Languages of Taiwan|Taiwanese languages]] in the broadcast media and in schools were also lifted.\n\nHowever, Lee failed to crack down on the massive corruption that pervaded the government and many KMT loyalists felt that Lee betrayed the ROC by taking reforms too far, while those in the opposition felt he did not take reforms far enough.\n\n===Democratic period===\nLee ran as the incumbent in Taiwan's first direct [[1996 Republic of China presidential election|presidential election in 1996]] against DPP candidate and former dissident, Peng Min-ming. This election prompted the PRC to conduct a series of missile tests in the [[Taiwan Strait]] to intimidate the Taiwanese electorate so that electorates would vote for other pro-unification candidates, [[Chen Li-an]] and [[Lin Yang-kang]]. The aggressive tactic prompted U.S. President [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] to invoke the [[Taiwan Relations Act]] and dispatch two aircraft carrier battle groups into the region off Taiwan's southern coast to monitor the situation, and PRC's missile tests were forced to end earlier than planned. This incident is known as the [[Third Taiwan Strait Crisis|1996 Taiwan Straits Crisis]].{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nOne of Lee's final acts as president was to declare on German radio that the ROC and the PRC have a [[Special state-to-state relations|special state to state relationship]]. Lee's statement was met with the PRC's People's Army conducting military drills in Fujian and a frightening island-wide [[Power outage|blackout]] in Taiwan, causing many to fear an attack or cyberattack.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe [[2000 ROC presidential election|2000 presidential election]] marked the end of the Kuomintang (KMT) rule. DPP candidate [[Chen Shui-bian]] won a three-way race that saw the [[Pan-Blue]] vote split by independent [[James Soong]] (formerly of the Kuomintang) and Kuomintang candidate [[Lien Chan]]. Chen garnered 39% of the vote.<ref>Asia Society, \"Opposition Wins Taiwan Election,\" (2000)</ref> After the election, Soong formed the [[People First Party (Republic of China)|People First Party]] (PFP).{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n[[2004 Taiwan presidential election|In 2004]], President Chen was re-elected to a second four-year term after an assassination attempt which occurred the day before the election. Two shots were fired, with one bullet grazing the President's belly after penetrating the windshield of a jeep and several layers of clothing and the other bullet penetrated the windshield and hitting the vice president's knee cast. (She was wearing a knee cast due to an earlier injury.) Police investigators have said that the most likely suspect is believed to have been [[Chen Yi-hsiung]], who was later found dead.<ref>Reuters, \"Taiwan election shooting suspect dead,\" (2005)</ref> Their injuries were not life-threatening, but the incident is believed by Pan-Blue to have gained them enough sympathy to influence the result.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nThat incident might also have given president Chen the ability to declare a state of emergency and martial law, which allegedly prevented the police and military, which were strongly Pan-Blue,{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} from voting. Lien refused to concede, alleging voting irregularities. Kuomintang and PFP supporters held mass protests throughout the following weeks. Subsequently, Kuomintang and PFP took the case to the court. The [[High Court of Taiwan|High Court]] ordered a recount and found no evidence to support the accusation made by Kuomintang and PFP. The Court decided that the election result was legitimate and valid.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nDuring the [[2004 Taiwan legislative election|legislative elections]] held on December 8, 2004, the Kuomintang-PFP dominated Pan-Blue alliance gained a slim majority in the elections which resulted in President Chen resigning as DPP chairman. The cabinet of Premier [[Yu Shyi-kun]] resigned, and [[Frank Hsieh]] assumed premiership on January 25, 2005.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn a move that some{{Who|date=December 2018}} saw as a reaction to Chen's re-election, the People's Republic of China enacted a proposed [[National Unification Promotion Law of the People's Republic of China (proposed)|anti-secession law]] that allows the [[use of force]] on Taiwan and the Republic of China government if it formally declares independence. However, this law was met with overwhelming protest from nearly all political parties and public figures of the Republic of China and disapproval from the western countries. Negotiations in January in [[Macau]] between the aviation authorities from both the Republic of China and People's Republic of China resulted in direct [[Cross-Strait charter|cross-strait charter flights]] between mainland China and Taiwan during the [[Chinese New Year|Chinese Lunar New Year]] Period.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn a twist of events, President Chen and PFP Chairman Soong held a summit and the independence-leaning president indicated that eventual [[Chinese unification|reunification with mainland China]] would be an option. Against the anti-secession law proposed by the People's Republic of China, President Chen held a video conference with the [[European Parliament]] in [[Brussels]] urging the [[European Union]] not to lift the arms embargo on the People's Republic of China.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nDomestic politics during the Chen administration were largely a political stalemate as the Kuomintang and PFP together held a pan-Blue majority in the legislature. Among the many items that made little progress due to the political stalemate were a stalled arms procurement bill, which would have advanced defense capabilities of the Republic of China through the purchase of weaponry, such as sub-hunting [[P-3 Orion]]s, from the US government, and banking reform legislation, which would have helped in the consolidation of the many banks in the Republic of China, none of which hold even 10% shares of the local market. The [[president of the Republic of China]], unlike the president of the United States, does not wield [[veto power]], providing him with little to no leverage in negotiating with an opposition legislature, regardless of how slim the majority.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe constitution was [[Additional Articles of the Constitution of the Republic of China|further amended]] in 2005, creating a two-vote electoral system, with [[single member plurality]] seats and [[proportional representation|proportional representative]] seats, and abolishing the National Assembly, transferring most of its former powers to the [[Legislative Yuan]], and leaving further amendment voting to public referendums. The issue of formally declaring the [[Taiwan independence|independence of Taiwan]] is also a constant constitutional question. Arms purchases from the United States are still a controversial political question, with the [[Pan-Green Coalition]] camp favoring the purchase, and the [[Pan-Blue Coalition]] opposing it.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\nRecent allegations about [[political corruption|corruption]] inside the [[First Family]] had led to three [[Recall election|recall motions]] votes in the [[Legislative Yuan]] aimed at ousting President [[Chen Shui-bian]]. All of them had failed since the Pan-Blue Coalition lacked the [[two-thirds majority]] required to complete the process and the [[political parties]] voted according to political lines. The [[First Lady]], [[Wu Shu-chen]] was prosecuted for corruption, namely illegally using state funds for personal reasons.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe president faced similar accusations as his wife, but was protected from prosecution by presidential [[Legal immunity|immunity]]. He had promised to resign if his wife was found guilty. However, after his wife fainted in the preparation hearing, she had sought and obtained absence of leave from the Court 16 times citing health concerns before President Chen Shui-bian's term was complete.<ref>[http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/national%20news/2008/09/18/175153/Former-first.htm Former first lady Wu to appear in court], ''China Post''</ref>\n\nIn December 2006, municipal and mayoral elections were held in [[Taipei]] and [[Kaohsiung]]. The [[KMT]] retained a clear majority in the capital, while the [[Democratic Progressive Party|DPP]] and the KMT obtained very close results in the southern city of [[Kaohsiung]]. [[Huang Chun-ying]] lost to [[Chen Chu]] by a margin of 0.14 percent; 378,303 votes to 379,417 votes, making [[Chen Chu]] the first female mayor of a [[Special municipality (Taiwan)|special municipality]] in the Republic of China. In 2007, the ROC applied for membership in the United Nations under the name \"Taiwan\", and was rejected by the General Assembly.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn 2007, President Chen proposed a policy of [[Four Wants and One Without]], which in substance states that Taiwan wants independence; Taiwan wants the rectification of its name; Taiwan wants a new constitution; Taiwan wants development; and Taiwanese politics is without [[Left\u2013right political spectrum|the question of left or right]], but only the question of [[Chinese unification|unification]] or [[Taiwan independence movement|independence]]. The reception of this proposed policy in Taiwanese general public was unclear. It, however, was met with a cold reception by both the PRC and the United States. The PRC Foreign Minister emphasised that the [[Anti-Secession Law]] was not a piece of [[Unenforceable|unenforceable legislation]], while the US Department of State spokesman Sean McCormack described Chen's policy as \"unhelpful\".<ref>{{cite web | title=US Says Taiwanese President's Independence Remarks 'Unhelpful'|date=2007-03-05 | publisher=Voice of America | url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/taiwan/2007/taiwan-070305-voa02.htm}}</ref>\n\nThe KMT also retained control of the legislature in the [[2008 Republic of China legislative election|Legislative Yuan elections in January 2008]]. In the [[2008 Republic of China presidential election|presidential election in May 2008]], KMT candidate [[Ma Ying-jeou]] ran on a platform supporting friendlier relations with mainland China and economic reforms, and defeated DPP candidate [[Frank Hsieh]] with 58.48% of the vote.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nOn the same day President Chen left office, losing presidential immunity, the Supreme Prosecutor's Office announced that they were launching an inquiry into corruption charges regarding Chen.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7409956.stm Taiwan ex-leader faces graft case]</ref> Later in 2008, members of his administration, including [[Chiou I-jen]], a former National Security Council secretary-general, and Yeh Sheng-mao, former director-general of the Ministry of Justice's Investigation Bureau, were arrested on [[Chen Shui-bian corruption charges|corruption charges]].

In the end, the government agreed to put on hold the ratification of an agreement with China which they had pushed through without proper debate. This event had far reaching consequences, and changed the mood of the electorate. In the [[2016 Republic of China general election|combined elections in January 2016]] the opposition candidate for President, [[Tsai Ing-wen]], of the DPP won with 56% of the vote, and the opposition DPP was catapulted into an outright majority in the parliament.

This article concerns itself with the properties that hold specifically because of the existence of kernels and cokernels.\n\nAlthough kernels and cokernels are special kinds of [[Equalizer (mathematics)|equalisers]] and [[coequaliser]]s, a pre-abelian category actually has ''all'' equalisers and coequalisers.\nWe simply construct the equaliser of two morphisms ''f'' and ''g'' as the kernel of their difference ''g''&thinsp;\u2212&thinsp;''f''{{space|hair}}; similarly, their coequaliser is the cokernel of their difference.\n(The alternative term \"difference kernel\" for binary equalisers derives from this fact.)\nSince pre-abelian categories have all finite [[Product (category theory)|products]] and [[coproduct]]s (the biproducts) and all binary equalisers and coequalisers (as just described), then by a general theorem of [[category theory]], they have all finite [[Limit (category theory)|limits]] and [[colimit]]s.\nThat is, pre-abelian categories are [[Finitely complete category|finitely complete]].\n\nThe existence of both kernels and cokernels gives a notion of [[Image (category theory)|image]] and [[coimage]].\nWe can define these as\n:im&nbsp;''f''&nbsp;:= ker&thinsp;coker&nbsp;''f'';\n:coim&nbsp;''f''&nbsp;:= coker&thinsp;ker&nbsp;''f''.\nThat is, the image is the kernel of the cokernel, and the coimage is the cokernel of the kernel.\n\nNote that this notion of image may not correspond to the usual notion of image, or [[Range (function)|range]], of a [[Function (mathematics)|functions]], even assuming that the morphisms in the category ''are'' functions.\nFor example, in the category of topological abelian groups, the image of a morphism actually corresponds to the inclusion of the ''[[Closure (topology)|closure]]'' of the range of the function.\nFor this reason, people will often distinguish the meanings of the two terms in this context, using \"image\" for the abstract categorical concept and \"range\" for the elementary set-theoretic concept.\n\nIn many common situations, such as the category of [[Set (mathematics)|sets]], where images and coimages exist, their objects are [[isomorphic]].\nPut more precisely, we have a factorisation of ''f'':&nbsp;''A''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''B'' as\n:''A''&nbsp;\u2192 ''C''&nbsp;\u2192 ''I''&nbsp;\u2192 ''B'',\nwhere the morphism on the left is the coimage, the morphism on the right is the image, and the morphism in the middle (called the ''parallel'' of ''f'') is an isomorphism.\n\nIn a pre-abelian category, ''this is not necessarily true''.\nThe factorisation shown above does always exist, but the parallel might not be an isomorphism.\nIn fact, the parallel of ''f'' is an isomorphism for every morphism ''f'' [[if and only if]] the pre-abelian category is an [[abelian category]].\nAn example of a non-abelian, pre-abelian category is, once again, the category of topological abelian groups.\nAs remarked, the image is the inclusion of the ''closure'' of the range; however, the coimage is a quotient map onto the range itself.\nThus, the parallel is the inclusion of the range into its closure, which is not an isomorphism unless the range was already [[closed set|closed]].\n\n== Exact functors ==\n\nRecall that all finite [[limit (category theory)|limits]] and [[colimit]]s exist in a pre-abelian category.\nIn general [[category theory]], a functor is called ''[[exact functor|left exact]]'' if it preserves all finite limits and ''[[exact functor|right exact]]'' if it preserves all finite colimits. (A functor is simply ''exact'' if it's both left exact and right exact.)\n\nIn a pre-abelian category, exact functors can be described in particularly simple terms.\nFirst, recall that an [[additive functor]] is a functor ''F'':&nbsp;'''C'''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;'''D''' between [[preadditive categories]] that acts as a [[group homomorphism]] on each [[hom-set]].\nThen it turns out that a functor between pre-abelian categories is left exact [[if and only if]] it is additive and preserves all kernels, and it's right exact if and only if it's additive and preserves all cokernels.\n\nNote that an exact functor, because it preserves both kernels and cokernels, preserves all images and coimages.\nExact functors are most useful in the study of [[abelian categories]], where they can be applied to [[exact sequence]]s.\n\n== Maximal exact structure ==\n\nOn every pre-abelian category <math>\\mathcal A</math> there exists an [[Exact category|exact structure]] <math>\\mathcal{E}_{\\text{max}}</math> that is maximal in the sense that it contains every other exact structure.

No sovereign [[duchy]] currently exists, but [[Luxembourg]] is a surviving example of a sovereign grand duchy. Historically there have been sovereign principalities with many styles of ruler, such as [[Countship]], [[Margraviate]] and even [[Lordship]], especially within the [[Holy Roman Empire]].\n\nWhile the preceding definition would seem to fit a [[princely state]] perfectly, the European historical tradition is to reserve that word for native monarchies in colonial countries, and to apply \"principality\" to the Western monarchies.\n\n==European==\n===Development===\nThough principalities existed in antiquity, even before the height of the [[Roman Empire]], the principality as it is known today developed in the [[Middle Ages]] between 750 and 1450 when [[feudalism]] was the primary [[economic]] and social system in much of Europe. Feudalism increased the power of local princes within a king's lands. As princes continued to gain more power over time, the authority of the king was diminished in many places. This led to political fragmentation as the king's lands were broken into mini-states ruled by princes and dukes who wielded absolute power over their small territories. This was especially prevalent in [[Europe]], and particularly with the [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire]].\n\nDuring the [[Late Middle Ages]] from 1200 to 1500, principalities were often at war with each other as royal houses asserted sovereignty over smaller principalities. These wars caused a great deal of instability and economies were destroyed. Episodes of [[bubonic plague]] also reduced the power of principalities to survive independently. Eventually, agricultural progress and development of new trade goods and services boosted commerce between principalities. Many of these states became wealthy, expanded their territories and improved the services provided to their citizens. Princes and dukes developed their lands, established new ports and chartered large thriving cities. Some used their new-found wealth to build palaces and other institutions now associated with sovereign states.\n\n===Consolidation===\n[[File:Johann Josef I von Liechtenstein.jpg|thumb|Prince [[Johann I Joseph, Prince of Liechtenstein|Johann I Josef]], last prince of [[Liechtenstein]] prior to the end of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]]]\nWhile some principalities prospered in their independence, less successful states were swallowed by stronger royal houses. Europe saw consolidation of small principalities into larger [[monarchy|kingdoms]] and [[empire]]s. This had already happened in [[Kingdom of England|England]] in the first millennium, and this trend subsequently led to the creation of such states as [[France]], [[Portugal]], and [[Spain]]. Another form of consolidation was orchestrated in [[Italy]] during the Renaissance by the [[Medici]] family. A banking family from [[Florence]], the Medici took control of governments in various [[Italy|Italian]] regions and even assumed the [[papacy]]. They then appointed family members as princes and assured their protection. [[Prussia]] also later expanded by acquiring the territories of many other states.\n\nHowever, in the 17th to 19th centuries, especially within the Holy Roman Empire, the reverse was also occurring: many new small sovereign states arose as a result of transfers of land for various reasons.\n\nNotable principalities existed until the early 20th century in various regions of [[Germany]] and [[Italy]].\n\n===Nationalism===\n[[Nationalism]], the belief that the nation-state is the best vehicle to realise the aspirations of a people, became popular in the late 19th century. A characteristic of nationalism is an identity with a larger region such as an area sharing a common language and culture. With this development, principalities fell out of favour. As a compromise, many principalities united with neighbouring regions and adopted constitutional forms of government, with the monarch acting as a mere figurehead while administration was left in the hands of elected parliaments. The trend in the 19th and 20th centuries was the abolition of various forms of monarchy and the creation of republican governments led by popularly elected presidents.\n\n===Ecclesiastical principalities===\nSeveral principalities where genealogical inheritance is replaced by succession in a religious office have existed in the [[Roman Catholic Church]], in each case consisting of a feudal polity (often a former secular principality in the broad sense) held ''ex officio'' \u2014 the closest possible equivalent to hereditary succession \u2014 by a [[Prince of the church]], styled more precisely according to his ecclesiastical rank, such as [[Prince-bishop]], [[Prince-abbot]] or, especially as a form of crusader state, [[Grand Master (order)|Grand Master]].\n\nSome of these instances were merely religious offices without sovereign power over any territory, while others, such as [[Prince-bishop of Salzburg|Salzburg]] and [[Prince-bishop of Durham|Durham]], shared some of the characteristics of secular princes.\n\nFrom this system of principalities, in 1910, it was born in the region of Calcedonia, in modern turkey, under intense persecution and genocide, the Sovereign Ecclesiastical Monarchy of the Sacred Catholic Church of the East of the Chaldeans, ruled by Major Archbishop-Catholicos, the Sovereign Monarch, with its current headquarters in Brazil.\n\n==Asia==\nPrior to the European colonialism, [[South Asia]] and [[South East Asia]] were under the influence of [[Indosphere]] of [[greater India]], where numerous [[Indianized kingdom|Indianized principalities]] and empires flourished for several centuries in Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines, Cambodia and Vietnam. The influence of Indian culture into these areas was given the term ''indianization''.

[[Indian honorifics]] also influenced the [[Malay styles and titles|Malay]], [[Thai royal and noble titles|Thai]], [[Filipino styles and honorifics|Filipino]] and [[Indonesian names#Honorifics|Indonesian]] honorifics.<ref name=tit1>Krishna Chandra Sagar, 2002, An Era of Peace, Page 52.</ref>\n\nIn the colonial context, the term [[princely states]] was used, especially for those that came under the sway of a European colonising power: for example the [[British India]]n and neighbouring or associated (e.g., Arabian) princely states were ruled by monarchs called Princes by the British, regardless of the native styles, which could be equivalent to royal or even imperial rank in the [[indigenous peoples|Indigenous]] cultures.\n\n==Other principalities==\n===Other===\nPrincipalities have also existed in ancient and modern civilizations of [[Africa]], [[Pre-Columbian America]] and [[Oceania]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n===Micronational principalities===\nSeveral [[micronation]]s, which ''de facto'' have few characteristics of sovereign states and are not recognized as such, more or less seriously claim the status of sovereign principalities. Examples are [[Principality of Sealand|Sealand]], a former military fort in the [[North Sea]]; [[Principality of Seborga|Seborga]], internationally considered a small town in [[Italy]]; and [[Principality of Hutt River|Hutt River]] and [[Principality of Wy]] in [[Mosman]], internationally considered to be in [[Australia]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Grand prince]]\n*[[Victory title]]\n*[[Emirate]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*[http://www.worldstatesmen.org/ WorldStatesmen]\n\n{{Terms for types of administrative territorial entities}}\n\n[[Category:Constitutional state types]]\n[[Category:Forms of government]]\n[[Category:Monarchy]]\n[[Category:Principalities| ]]\n[[Category:Types of country subdivisions]]\n", "name_user": "2804:7f3:8280:6789:9c7f:4c6a:2519:380f", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eEcclesiastical principalities)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principality"}
