Vilarinho da Castanheira also shows evidence of the areas importance as a graveyard and burial site: bodies were buried here, surrounded by large rock monuments and objects of the local religion.<ref name=CMHistoria/> In Cach\u00e3o da Rapa, in the shadow of the [[Douro]] river, there are similar paintings of dark red and blues, that include anthropomorphic stylized human beings. The discovery of archeological artifacts, namely [[lithic flake]]s of [[quartz]], fragments of metamorphic [[schist]] implements, rounded pebbles and [[machete]]s, support the belief that indigenous peoples used the space. There are also [[Stone tool|lithic]] remnants scattered throughout the municipality with many symbols (arcs, circles or semi-circles).<ref name=CMHistoria/> In the [[Chalcolithic]] and [[Iron Age]], settlements were common in the region of Carrazed de Ansi\u00e3es: places such as Castro, Lapa, Serro and Castelo Fontoura, indicate the exists of organized settlement during these periods.<ref name=CMHistoria/>\n\nThe Romans also reorganized the territory; in the Roman villa in ''Quinta da Senhora da Ribeira'' (in Tralhariz), there were discovered vestiges of the construction of a sumptuous residence, completed with polychromatic tile, colonnaded interiors and carved relief.<ref name=CMHistoria/> During this era Ansi\u00e3es was a Roman city, designated ''Aquas Quintianas''. The town had three altars dedicated to the local protector ''Tutelae Tiriensi'', the other to ''Bandu Vordeaeco'' (to the cult of [[Lusitania]] in Seixo de Ansi\u00e3es) and lastly to [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] ''Optimum M\u00e1ximo'' ({{lang-en|Supreme God}}) in Pombal.<ref name=CMHistoria/> There are also visible remains of the Roman roads, including a variant of the Roman road that connect Braga and Chave, over many Roman era bridges, such as Ponte das Olgas (Pereiros) and Ponte do Torno (Amedo). The Roman era reached its end with barbarian invasions, the [[Suebi]] controlling the territory with their administrative seat in ''Pagus Auneco'', which ultimately led to the growing influence of the walled settlement of Ansi\u00e3es.<ref name=CMHistoria/>\n\nThe [[Berber people|Berber]] settlers vacilited considerable with Moorish influence after 711. Taking advantage of the ancient territories, Pagus gave way to Valiato de Alf\u00e2ndica.<ref name=CMHistoria/> There are several local toponymic names from this period, including Reimoira, Mourinha, Pala da Moura and Mour\u00e3ozinho. It was the arrival of the Moors that drove many Christians, who did not wish to be ruled by Muslim tribes, to take refuge in [[Asturias]], pushing there, for the [[Reconquista]] of Christian Iberia.<ref name=CMHistoria/> It was at this time that the town of Ansi\u00e3es began to take on a strategic role. The town was a walled outpost that defended Christian territory, and for that role [[Ferdinand I of Le\u00f3n and Castile]] issued a [[foral]] in the 11th century (1055/1065) in order to fix the frontier. This foral, which pre-dated the Portuguese Kingdom, was the first to be issued for lands that today pertain to Portugal.<ref name=CMHistoria/>\n\nAnsi\u00e3es importance maintained itself, successively, resulting in various confirmations: by [[Afonso Henriques]], [[Sancho I of Portugal|Sancho I]], [[Afonso II of Portugal|Afonso II]] and a final foral, promulgated in 1510 by [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]].<ref name=CMHistoria/> In addition to administrative and strategic roles, Ansi\u00e3es controlled aspects of the regional economy; Ansi\u00e3es, due its location and access to communication channels (relics of its Roman history), which rapidly transformed it into a \"dry port\" that served commercial interests in the area.<ref name=CMHistoria/> Because of this, on 16 April 1277, it received a ''Market Charter'' ({{lang-pt|Carta de Feira|links=no}}), signed by King [[Afonso III of Portugal|Afonso III]], that stipulated the towns right to have a monthly fair, at the end of every month, which lasted a day. It also guaranteed that those who attended the fair were secure (either coming or going to the event) three days before and after the fair. These privileges were granted by the monarchy in order to promote internal commerce, interpersonal relations, and enrich the kingdom's coffers. For this reason, the King suspended debts of those that attended the fairs, as well as imposing fines for those who swindled participants.\n\nAnsi\u00e3es was encircled by a double-wall: the interior wall protected the administrative and military facilities, while the outer wall secured the local populous. There were four main gates. Of these, the Gate of S\u00e3o Francisco (to the northeast), which served as the entranceway for horsemen and carts, while the Gate of S\u00e3o Salvador linked the areas within the walls.\n\nDuring this epoch, the principal settlements were Ansi\u00e3es, Vilarinho da Castanheira and Linhares, that included the ecclesiastical parishes of S\u00e3o Salvador, S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o, Santa Maria and S\u00e3o Miguel.<ref name=CMHistoria/> On 23 May 1320, a Bull by Pope John XXII, conceded to King [[Denis of Portugal]] a three-year war subsidy, from a [[tithe]] of ecclesiastical rents within his Kingdom, knowing that the parishes were taxed in large increments.<ref name=CMHistoria/>\n\nAnsi\u00e3es was also highlighted during the [[1383\u201385 Crisis|Portuguese Interregnum]], after the death of King [[Ferdinand I of Portugal|Ferdinand]], when its population positioned themselves on the side of [[John I of Portugal|John I]], the [[House of Aviz|Master of Aviz]], while Vilarinho da Castanheira supported the other pretender [[Beatrice of Portugal|Beatrice]].<ref name=CMHistoria/> Local support was resolved with the Battle of Valdrange (1384), when Vasco Pires Sampaio's forces triumph over the pretenders subjects, and squarely aligned the region with John.<ref name=CMHistoria/> When the new monarch assumed the throne, John travelled to the places where supporters had sworn allegiance to his Order, arriving on 23 October 1396 in Linhares, where he signed a regal proclamation.<ref name=CMHistoria/>\n\nDiogo de Sampaio, [[donatorio]] of Ansi\u00e3es, later accompanied with 14 [[squire]]s and many infantrymen, supported King [[Afonso V of Portugal|Afonso V]] in the [[Battle of Toro]] (1476), when he reclaimed the throne of Castile, and which resulted in Sampaio being honoured with the title of ''[[Alcalde|Alcaide-mor]]'' of Ansi\u00e3es. This loyalty, which resulted in the motto ''Anci\u00e3es leal ao Reyno de Portugal'' (''Ansi\u00e3es Loyal to the Kingdom of Portugal''), also resulted in local unflinching support of [[Sebastian of Portugal|Sebastian]] on his conquest of North Africa; many local residents joined the King at the [[Battle of Alc\u00e1cer Quibir]] (1578).<ref name=CMHistoria/> This episode was the origin of Ansi\u00e3es' slow demographic decline, in addition to the eventual loss of autonomy: the people of Ansi\u00e3es also supported [[Ant\u00f3nio, Prior of Crato]] against [[Philip II of Spain]]' [[Iberian Union]], which disadvantaged it economically and socially.<ref name=CMHistoria/>\n\nDuring the War of Spanish Succession (1704\u201315), Portugal joined the English, Dutch and Austrian Empires against [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], which included many men from the farms and villages of Ansi\u00e3es. This was one of the last autonomic interventions of its residents, since in 1734 its administrative sovereignty was suppressed by its amalgamation with Carrazeda, its toponymy the only vestige of the municipal history.<ref name=CMHistoria/>\n\nThe Liberal Revolution of 1820, resulted in appeals from liberalist forces of [[Peter IV of Portugal|Peter IV]] in Porto, arriving to swear allegiance to the 1822 Constitution years later.\n\nOn 7 October 1910, during a meeting in the municipal hall: ''\"[The President] congratulates the Government, the troops and the people of Lisbon for the victory achieved in the Implantation of Portuguese Republic and sends votes that she has a future in peace and order.\"''<ref name=CMHistoria/>\n\nWith the First World War, the municipality lost many lives during Portuguese participation, which included the loss of life in Infantry Regiment 30, stationed in [[Mozambique]].\n\nThe military coup on 28 May 1926, which ushered in the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] dictatorship was the impetus for the creation of the ''Comiss\u00e3o da Alian\u00e7a Republicana Socialista'' (''Commission for Republican Socialist Alliance'') in which was established in Carrazeda de Ansi\u00e3es.\n \nIn 1974, once again, the municipal authorities joined together (9 May), to declare: ''\"...unanimously, make it expressed in meeting notes, today, its support for the [[Movimento das For\u00e7as Armadas]] and manifest their entire confidence in the acts of the ''[[National Salvation Junta|Junta de Salva\u00e7\u00e3o Nacional]]'', with entire concordance in the program presented.\"''<ref name=CMHistoria/>\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Physical geography===\n[[File:Douro wine grapes ripe for the harvest.jpg|235px|left|thumb|Grapes ripening on the vine, emblematic of the wine region of the Douro]]The municipality of Carrazeda de Ansi\u00e3es is situated on the right margin of the [[Douro River]], and left margin of its tributary, the Tua River.

Vilarinho da Castanheira also shows evidence of the areas importance as a graveyard and burial site: bodies were buried here, surrounded by large rock monuments and objects of the local religion.<ref name=CMHistoria/> In Cach\u00e3o da Rapa, in the shadow of the [[Douro]] river, there are similar paintings of dark red and blues, that include anthropomorphic stylized human beings. The discovery of archeological artifacts, namely [[lithic flake]]s of [[quartz]], fragments of metamorphic [[schist]] implements, rounded pebbles and [[machete]]s, support the belief that indigenous peoples used the space. There are also [[Stone tool|lithic]] remnants scattered throughout the municipality with many symbols (arcs, circles or semi-circles).<ref name=CMHistoria/> In the [[Chalcolithic]] and [[Iron Age]], settlements were common in the region of Carrazed de Ansi\u00e3es: places such as Castro, Lapa, Serro and Castelo Fontoura, indicate the exists of organized settlement during these periods.<ref name=CMHistoria/>\n\nThe Romans also reorganized the territory; in the Roman villa in ''Quinta da Senhora da Ribeira'' (in Tralhariz), there were discovered vestiges of the construction of a sumptuous residence, completed with polychromatic tile, colonnaded interiors and carved relief.<ref name=CMHistoria/> During this era Ansi\u00e3es was a Roman city, designated ''Aquas Quintianas''. The town had three altars dedicated to the local protector ''Tutelae Tiriensi'', the other to ''Bandu Vordeaeco'' (to the cult of [[Lusitania]] in Seixo de Ansi\u00e3es) and lastly to [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] ''Optimum M\u00e1ximo'' ({{lang-en|Supreme God}}) in Pombal.<ref name=CMHistoria/> There are also visible remains of the Roman roads, including a variant of the Roman road that connect Braga and Chave, over many Roman era bridges, such as Ponte das Olgas (Pereiros) and Ponte do Torno (Amedo). The Roman era reached its end with barbarian invasions, the [[Suebi]] controlling the territory with their administrative seat in ''Pagus Auneco'', which ultimately led to the growing influence of the walled settlement of Ansi\u00e3es.<ref name=CMHistoria/>\n\nThe [[Berber people|Berber]] settlers vacilited considerable with Moorish influence after 711. Taking advantage of the ancient territories, Pagus gave way to Valiato de Alf\u00e2ndica.<ref name=CMHistoria/> There are several local toponymic names from this period, including Reimoira, Mourinha, Pala da Moura and Mour\u00e3ozinho. It was the arrival of the Moors that drove many Christians, who did not wish to be ruled by Muslim tribes, to take refuge in [[Asturias]], pushing there, for the [[Reconquista]] of Christian Iberia.<ref name=CMHistoria/> It was at this time that the town of Ansi\u00e3es began to take on a strategic role. The town was a walled outpost that defended Christian territory, and for that role [[Ferdinand I of Le\u00f3n and Castile]] issued a [[foral]] in the 11th century (1055/1065) in order to fix the frontier. This foral, which pre-dated the Portuguese Kingdom, was the first to be issued for lands that today pertain to Portugal.<ref name=CMHistoria/>\n\nAnsi\u00e3es importance maintained itself, successively, resulting in various confirmations: by [[Afonso Henriques]], [[Sancho I of Portugal|Sancho I]], [[Afonso II of Portugal|Afonso II]] and a final foral, promulgated in 1510 by [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]].<ref name=CMHistoria/> In addition to administrative and strategic roles, Ansi\u00e3es controlled aspects of the regional economy; Ansi\u00e3es, due its location and access to communication channels (relics of its Roman history), which rapidly transformed it into a \"dry port\" that served commercial interests in the area.<ref name=CMHistoria/> Because of this, on 16 April 1277, it received a ''Market Charter'' ({{lang-pt|Carta de Feira|links=no}}), signed by King [[Afonso III of Portugal|Afonso III]], that stipulated the towns right to have a monthly fair, at the end of every month, which lasted a day. It also guaranteed that those who attended the fair were secure (either coming or going to the event) three days before and after the fair. These privileges were granted by the monarchy in order to promote internal commerce, interpersonal relations, and enrich the kingdom's coffers. For this reason, the King suspended debts of those that attended the fairs, as well as imposing fines for those who swindled participants.\n\nAnsi\u00e3es was encircled by a double-wall: the interior wall protected the administrative and military facilities, while the outer wall secured the local populous. There were four main gates. Of these, the Gate of S\u00e3o Francisco (to the northeast), which served as the entranceway for horsemen and carts, while the Gate of S\u00e3o Salvador linked the areas within the walls.\n\nDuring this epoch, the principal settlements were Ansi\u00e3es, Vilarinho da Castanheira and Linhares, that included the ecclesiastical parishes of S\u00e3o Salvador, S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o, Santa Maria and S\u00e3o Miguel.<ref name=CMHistoria/> On 23 May 1320, a Bull by Pope John XXII, conceded to King [[Denis of Portugal]] a three-year war subsidy, from a [[tithe]] of ecclesiastical rents within his Kingdom, knowing that the parishes were taxed in large increments.<ref name=CMHistoria/>\n\nAnsi\u00e3es was also highlighted during the [[1383\u201385 Crisis|Portuguese Interregnum]], after the death of King [[Ferdinand I of Portugal|Ferdinand]], when its population positioned themselves on the side of [[John I of Portugal|John I]], the [[House of Aviz|Master of Aviz]], while Vilarinho da Castanheira supported the other pretender [[Beatrice of Portugal|Beatrice]].<ref name=CMHistoria/> Local support was resolved with the Battle of Valdrange (1384), when Vasco Pires Sampaio's forces triumph over the pretenders subjects, and squarely aligned the region with John.<ref name=CMHistoria/> When the new monarch assumed the throne, John travelled to the places where supporters had sworn allegiance to his Order, arriving on 23 October 1396 in Linhares, where he signed a regal proclamation.<ref name=CMHistoria/>\n\nDiogo de Sampaio, [[donatorio]] of Ansi\u00e3es, later accompanied with 14 [[squire]]s and many infantrymen, supported King [[Afonso V of Portugal|Afonso V]] in the [[Battle of Toro]] (1476), when he reclaimed the throne of Castile, and which resulted in Sampaio being honoured with the title of ''[[Alcalde|Alcaide-mor]]'' of Ansi\u00e3es. This loyalty, which resulted in the motto ''Anci\u00e3es leal ao Reyno de Portugal'' (''Ansi\u00e3es Loyal to the Kingdom of Portugal''), also resulted in local unflinching support of [[Sebastian of Portugal|Sebastian]] on his conquest of North Africa; many local residents joined the King at the [[Battle of Alc\u00e1cer Quibir]] (1578).<ref name=CMHistoria/> This episode was the origin of Ansi\u00e3es' slow demographic decline, in addition to the eventual loss of autonomy: the people of Ansi\u00e3es also supported [[Ant\u00f3nio, Prior of Crato]] against [[Philip II of Spain]]' [[Iberian Union]], which disadvantaged it economically and socially.<ref name=CMHistoria/>\n\nDuring the War of Spanish Succession (1704\u201315), Portugal joined the English, Dutch and Austrian Empires against [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], which included many men from the farms and villages of Ansi\u00e3es. This was one of the last autonomic interventions of its residents, since in 1734 its administrative sovereignty was suppressed by its amalgamation with Carrazeda, its toponymy the only vestige of the municipal history.<ref name=CMHistoria/>\n\nThe Liberal Revolution of 1820, resulted in appeals from liberalist forces of [[Peter IV of Portugal|Peter IV]] in Porto, arriving to swear allegiance to the 1822 Constitution years later.\n\nOn 7 October 1910, during a meeting in the municipal hall: ''\"[The President] congratulates the Government, the troops and the people of Lisbon for the victory achieved in the Implantation of Portuguese Republic and sends votes that she has a future in peace and order.\"''<ref name=CMHistoria/>\n\nWith the First World War, the municipality lost many lives during Portuguese participation, which included the loss of life in Infantry Regiment 30, stationed in [[Mozambique]].\n\nThe military coup on 28 May 1926, which ushered in the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] dictatorship was the impetus for the creation of the ''Comiss\u00e3o da Alian\u00e7a Republicana Socialista'' (''Commission for Republican Socialist Alliance'') in which was established in Carrazeda de Ansi\u00e3es.\n \nIn 1974, once again, the municipal authorities joined together (9 May), to declare: ''\"...unanimously, make it expressed in meeting notes, today, its support for the [[Movimento das For\u00e7as Armadas]] and manifest their entire confidence in the acts of the ''[[National Salvation Junta|Junta de Salva\u00e7\u00e3o Nacional]]'', with entire concordance in the program presented.\"''<ref name=CMHistoria/>\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Physical geography===\n[[File:Douro wine grapes ripe for the harvest.jpg|235px|left|thumb|Grapes ripening on the vine, emblematic of the wine region of the Douro]]The municipality of Carrazeda de Ansi\u00e3es is situated on the right margin of the [[Douro River]], and left margin of its tributary, the Tua River.

They appear in groups from every corner of the village running and shouting excitedly, frightening the people and \u201crobbing\u201d all the wineries.\n\nThe main target of these masquerade groups are single young girls, who make them climb to the top of walls and verandas.\n\nScholars associate the ''Careto'' tradition with memories of magical practices related to agrarian fertility cults.<ref name=\"Careto's Tradition\">{{cite web|last=Carvalho Pereira|first=Jos\u00e9 Paulo|title=Careto's Tradition|url=http://www.azibo.org/eng/caretosorigemeng.html|work=Careto's Tradition|publisher=www.azibo.org|accessdate=2012-02-01|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529040327/http://www.azibo.org/eng/caretosorigemeng.html|archivedate=2010-05-29}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20100529040327/http://www.azibo.org/eng/caretosorigemeng.html Careto's Tradition] Article by Jos\u00e9 Paulo Carvalho Pereira in azibo.org, February 2006\n*[https://archive.is/20121215030633/http://louisville.edu/anthropology/portuguese-studies-program/portuguese-studies-photo-gallery/miscellaneous/caretos%20de%20podence.jpeg/view University of Louisville Department of Anthropology]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060224210017/http://www.bragancanet.pt/arte/podence.html Carnival of Podence] (in Portuguese)\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20160209233935/http://caretosdepodence.no.sapo.pt/ Endless energy of the Caretos] (in Portuguese)\n{{commons category|Carnival of Podence}}\n\n[[Category:Carnivals in Portugal]]\n[[Category:Celtic culture]]\n[[Category:Cultural festivals in Portugal]]\n[[Category:Fertility]]\n[[Category:Macedo de Cavaleiros]]\n[[Category:Paganism in Europe]]\n[[Category:Portuguese traditions]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Careto"}

Seward is an adaptation of [[John Seward]] from [[Bram Stoker]]'s [[Dracula (novel)|Dracula]], and claims to be a descendant of Joan Clayton, the character LuPone portrayed in the second season. Also in 2016, she began appearing in ''[[Steven Universe]]'' as the voice of Yellow Diamond.<ref>{{cite tweet|user=ianjq|author=ian jq|number=685238374509101056|date=7 January 2016|title=Yellow Diamond is voiced by VERY special guest: star of stage and screen, the one and only Patti Lupone! #StevenUniverse}}</ref> In 2019, LuPone played a role in [[Pose (TV series)|Pose]], appearing in second season of the series.\n\n==Stance on distractions from audience members==\nLuPone opposes recording, photographs, and other electronic distractions in live theatre. \"Where's the elegance?\" she asked in a blog post on her official site. \"I mean, I'm glad they show up because God knows it's a dying art form and I guess I'm glad they're all comfortable, sleeping, eating and drinking, things they should be doing at home and in a restaurant. But it's just not done in the theater or shouldn't be.\" LuPone has been the subject of some controversy due to the bluntness of her statements regarding this matter.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.pattilupone.net/ramblings52.html | title = Ramblings From the Road |publisher=Pattilupone.net |date=2006-01-24 |accessdate=2010-03-29}}</ref>\n\nA related incident occurred at the second to last performance of ''Gypsy'' on January 10, 2009. LuPone, irritated by flash photography, stopped in the middle of \"Rose's Turn\" and loudly demanded that the interloper be removed from the theatre. After he was removed, LuPone restarted her number.

They can't concentrate on the stage if, in their peripheral vision, they're seeing texting, they're seeing cameras, they're listening to phone calls.

They cannot put them down.

I am so defeated by this issue that I seriously question whether I want to work on stage anymore.
