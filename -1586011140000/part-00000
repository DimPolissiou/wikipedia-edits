The corps was raised during the expansion of the [[Volunteer Force|Volunteer movement]] in the 1850s and then served with the [[Territorial Force]] during [[World War I]]. It converted to an anti-aircraft role just prior to [[World War II]], and continued to serve until it was amalgamated in 1950.\n\n== Volunteer Force ==\nThe enthusiasm for the Volunteer movement following an invasion scare in 1859 saw the creation of many Rifle Volunteer Corps (RVCs) composed of part-time soldiers eager to supplement the Regular [[British Army]] in time of need.<ref>Beckett.</ref><ref>Westlake, ''Rifle Volunteers''.</ref> One of these new corps was the 1st Northumberland RVC (also known as the Northumberland Rifles) formed in [[North Shields]] and [[Tynemouth]] on 16 August 1859 by coal-owner Edward Potter of [[Cramlington]]. It took some moral courage to appear in the street in Volunteer uniform: members of the 1st Northumberland RVC were sneered at as 'noodles'. However, the movement continued to grow: in February 1860 the 1st absorbed the 2nd Northumberland RVC of three companies, also formed at Tynemouth on 4 January that year. In August 1861 it split to form the 1st (Tynemouth), 8th (three companies at [[Walker-on-Tyne]]) and 9th (Cramlington) Northumberland RVCs, which were all placed in the '''2nd Administrative Battalion of Northumberland Rifle Volunteers'''. The 1st disbanded in October 1862 and the 9th in December 1864, but the '''8th (Walker) Northumberland RVC''' thrived. The HQ of the 2nd Admin Battalion moved to Walker after the disbandment of the 1st; it was disbanded in 1865 and the 8th continued as an independent corps with James Anderson, a former [[Ensign_(rank)#United_Kingdom|ensign]] in the [[30th Foot]], as [[Lieutenant colonel (United Kingdom)|lieutenant-colonel]] in command.

When German forces crossed into [[Belgium]], the [[United Kingdom]] declared war on [[Germany]] and later the rest of the [[Central Powers]].

The large majority of the Northumbrian Division accepted. On 15 August the [[War Office]] (WO) issued instructions to separate those men who had signed up for Home Service only, and form these into reserve units. On 31 August, the formation of a reserve or 2nd Line unit was authorised for each 1st Line unit where 60 per cent or more of the men had volunteered for Overseas Service. The titles of these 2nd Line units would be the same as the original, but distinguished by a '2/' prefix.

The corps was raised during the expansion of the [[Volunteer Force|Volunteer movement]] in the 1850s and then served with the [[Territorial Force]] during [[World War I]]. It converted to an anti-aircraft role just prior to [[World War II]], and continued to serve until it was amalgamated in 1950.\n\n== Volunteer Force ==\nThe enthusiasm for the Volunteer movement following an invasion scare in 1859 saw the creation of many Rifle Volunteer Corps (RVCs) composed of part-time soldiers eager to supplement the Regular [[British Army]] in time of need.<ref>Beckett.</ref><ref>Westlake, ''Rifle Volunteers''.</ref> One of these new corps was the 1st Northumberland RVC (also known as the Northumberland Rifles) formed in [[North Shields]] and [[Tynemouth]] on 16 August 1859 by coal-owner Edward Potter of [[Cramlington]]. It took some moral courage to appear in the street in Volunteer uniform: members of the 1st Northumberland RVC were sneered at as 'noodles'. However, the movement continued to grow: in February 1860 the 1st absorbed the 2nd Northumberland RVC of three companies, also formed at Tynemouth on 4 January that year. In August 1861 it split to form the 1st (Tynemouth), 8th (three companies at [[Walker-on-Tyne]]) and 9th (Cramlington) Northumberland RVCs, which were all placed in the '''2nd Administrative Battalion of Northumberland Rifle Volunteers'''. The 1st disbanded in October 1862 and the 9th in December 1864, but the '''8th (Walker) Northumberland RVC''' thrived. The HQ of the 2nd Admin Battalion moved to Walker after the disbandment of the 1st; it was disbanded in 1865 and the 8th continued as an independent corps with James Anderson, a former [[Ensign_(rank)#United_Kingdom|ensign]] in the [[30th Foot]], as [[Lieutenant colonel (United Kingdom)|lieutenant-colonel]] in command.

When German forces crossed into [[Belgium]], the [[United Kingdom]] declared war on [[Germany]] and later the rest of the [[Central Powers]]. At the time the units of the Northumbrian Division were at their annual training camp in [[North Wales]]. On 3 August they were ordered to return to their respective headquarters, where at 17.00 next day they received orders to [[Mobilization|mobilise]]. The units went to their war stations along the coast, where there were numerous alerts. In October the division became part of [[Central Force]] in Home Defence and manned the [[Tyne]] Defences.<ref name = Becke50/><ref name=\":52\"/><ref>Wyrall, p.4.</ref>\n\nOn the outbreak of war, TF units were invited to volunteer for Overseas Service. The large majority of the Northumbrian Division accepted. On 15 August the [[War Office]] (WO) issued instructions to separate those men who had signed up for Home Service only, and form these into reserve units. On 31 August, the formation of a reserve or 2nd Line unit was authorised for each 1st Line unit where 60 per cent or more of the men had volunteered for Overseas Service. The titles of these 2nd Line units would be the same as the original, but distinguished by a '2/' prefix.

On 1 January 1947 most of these regiments were reconstituted and many new regiments were formed as part of the reformed and re-organised TA, with new numbers according to the renumbering plan for the complete re-designation of all RA units, both regular and territorial.  In accordance with this, the light anti-aircraft (LAA) regiments were assigned numbers between 512 and 588. The 5th Btn was reformed as '''588th (Royal Northumberland Fusiliers) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery''', and followed the new standard RA organisation, which consisted of RHQ, P, Q, and R Batteries, all of which were based in Walker on Tyne. The regiment provided the LAA component of the TA's [[50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division]].<ref name=\":02\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":4\" /><ref name = FarnM/><ref name=\":6\">Litchfield, pp. 5-6.</ref><ref>Frederick, Volume II, p. 1024.</ref><ref>[http://www.orbat.info/history/historical/uk/ta47.html  Watson, ''TA 1947''.]</ref><ref>Litchfield, Appendix 5.</ref><ref name = 45on>[http://british-army-units1945on.co.uk/territorial-army-royal-artillery/564-591-regiments.html 564\u2013591 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on.]</ref>\n\nOn 1 September 1950 the regiment was converted back to infantry and simultaneously merged with the 4th Btn to form the '''4th/5th Battalion, The Royal Northumberland Fusiliers'''.

Further he is assisted by an army of [[shaitan|demons]]. Nevertheless, the most reliable supporters will be the Jews, to whom he will be the incarnation of God.

The relation between the two is obscure. In one tradition, it is known that Jesus circumambulating the [[Kaaba]], the Dajjal following him, depicting the Dajjal as an evil shadowy ''Doppelganger'' of the real Jesus. At the end, the Dajjal will be killed by Jesus.
