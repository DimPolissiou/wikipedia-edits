The album debuted at number 8 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. As of January 2008, the album has sold 440,000 copies in the United States.\n\n== Singles ==\nThe album's first single, \"[[We Takin' Over]]\" was released on April 1, 2007.

Steve 'Flash' Juon of ''RapReviews'' praised the album for showcasing great lyricism and production from some of the best rappers and producers working at the time but found Khaled's repeated trademark phrases annoying, concluding with: \"Other than that though this album is good - hell it's even summer banger ride in your Jeep with it 'til October good.

The members of the other branches added frequently to their surname the name of the place where they chose to live and where a castle was available for their residence. The first of such cases were the Visconti of [[Massino Visconti|Massino]], the Visconti of [[Invorio]] and the Visconti of [[Oleggio Castello]].<ref>{{harvp|Filippini|2014|pages=62\u201363}}</ref> In these localities the castle ([[Visconti Castle (Massino)|Massino]]), its remains ([[Visconti Castle (Invorio)|Invorio]]) or a later reconstruction of the initial building ([[Dal Pozzo Castle|Oleggio Castello]]) are still today visible.\n\n==Lords and Dukes of Milan==\nThe Visconti ruled Milan until the early [[Renaissance]], first as Lords, then, from 1395, with the mighty [[Gian Galeazzo Visconti|Gian Galeazzo]] who endeavored to unify Northern Italy and [[Tuscany]], as [[Duchy of Milan|Dukes]]. Visconti rule in Milan ended with the death of [[Filippo Maria Visconti]] in 1447. He was succeeded by a [[Ambrosian Republic|short-lived republic]] and then by his son-in-law [[Francesco I Sforza]], who established the reign of the [[House of Sforza]].<ref name=\"harvp|Hale|1981|p=338\u2013341, 352\">{{harvp|Hale|1981|p=338\u2013341, 352}}</ref><ref name=\"harvp|Williams|1998|p=33\u201335\">{{harvp|Williams|1998|p=33\u201335}}</ref>\n\n===Rise to the lordship===\nWith the death of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] in 1250 and the ceasing of the war of the [[Lombard League]] against him, which itself was a reason for the Milanese [[Medieval commune|commune]] to be united in its defence, a period of conflicts between rivaling factions began inside the city. The [[Della Torre]] family progressively acquired power in Milan after 1240, when Pagano Della Torre assumed the leadership of the Credenza di Sant'Ambrogio, a political party with a popular base. This allowed them to have a role in the tax collection of the commune (estimo), which was essential to finance the war against Frederick II while affecting the great landowners. In 1247 Pagano was succeeded by his nephew [[Martino della Torre|Martino Della Torre]]. To underline the preeminence of his position, the new role of Senior of the Credenza (Anziano della Credenza) was created. In this position the Della Torre began to be confronted with the Milanese noble families organized in their own political party, the Societas Capitaneorum et Valvassorum, having the Visconti among the most prominent figures. After a period of unrest between the opposite parties, in 1258 the so-called Sant'Ambrogio Peace was signed among the parties, strengthening the position of La Credenza and La Motta (a second political party with popular tendencies).<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=33\u201345}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Menant|2005|page=67}}</ref>\n\nThe peace was undermined by new events in favour of the Della Torre. At the end of 1259, [[Oberto Pallavicino]], a former partisan of Frederick II who got closer to the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelph]] positions of the Della Torre, was appointed by the Milanese commune for five years in the role of General Captain of the People. Pallavicino's position in Milan was greatly enhanced by the victory he obtained in the [[Battle of Cassano (1259)|Battle of Cassano]] on 16 September 1259, against [[Ezzelino III da Romano|Ezzelino da Romano]], formerly his ally on the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Ghibelline]] side in the war against Milan, the Lombard League and the Papacy. In Ezzelino the noble expelled from Milan during the clashes preceding the Sant'Ambrogio Peace placed their hopes to get back in the city to their old power. In 1264, when Pallavicino left his office (preparing another change of alliance), Martino Della Torre remained the sole ruler of Milan and de facto its Lord.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=45\u201351}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Menant|2005|pages=111\u2013112}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Jones|1997|pages=520\u2013521}}</ref> A decisive event in the confrontation between the Della Torre and the Visconti factions was the appointment of [[Ottone Visconti]] to archbishop of Milan in 1262. Ottone was preferred by [[Urban IV|Pope Urban IV]] to [[Raimondo della Torre|Raimondo]], another candidate member of the Della Torre family. Prevented from assuming his office and forced by the opposite faction to remain outside the city, Ottone tried to settle in Arona, at the border of the Milanese archdiocese. At the end of 1263, Della Torre forces with the support of Oberto Pallavicino dislodged him from Arona. Ottone sought refuge in central Italy near the pope. The Della Torre party under the guidance of Filippo Della Torre, brother of Martino and his successor after 1263, took advantage also of the favour of [[Charles I of Anjou|Charles of Anjou]]. Milan forged an alliance with him and with other northern Italian cities (Guelph League) to fight the [[Hohenstaufen]] rule in southern Italy. Francesco Della Torre led the Milanese expedition in southern Italy, which ended in 1266 with the allied victory against [[Manfred, King of Sicily|Manfred of Sicily]] in the [[Battle of Benevento]]. Charles of Anjou became the new [[List of monarchs of Sicily|King of Sicily]], having also an indirect rule (exercised through the Della Torre) on Milan.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=56\u201362}}</ref>\n\nTrying to take advantage from the favourable moment, in 1266 the Della Torre made an attempt to advocate their cause against the Visconti in a [[Consistory court|consistory]] held by [[Pope Clement IV]] in [[Viterbo]] and attended by the archbishop Ottone. Despite the presence of a delegate of Charles of Anjou the decision of the pope was in favour of Ottone. An attempt was then made by the Pope to appease the Milanese factions by means of an oath of allegiance demanded to the Milanese population. Part of it was the acceptance of Ottone as archbishop. The events however were changed again by new circumstances in favour of the Della Torre. At the end of 1266 in Germany was taken the decision to support [[Conradin]], the last member of the Hohenstaufen dynasty, in an attempt to recover the domains in southern Italy lost after the defeat of Benevento and the death of Manfred of Sicily. This reinstated again the Della Torre in their position of leaders of the Guelph League. Moreover, in 1268, Clement IV died, initiating a period of papal vacancy that left without practical consequences the dispositions in favour of Ottone.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=64\u201367}}</ref>\n\nAfter the definitive end of the Hohenstaufen threat (Conradin was defeated and executed in Naples in 1268), the confrontation between the two Milanese factions assumed more and more a military connotation. A leading figure on the Visconti side was Simone Orelli da Locarno, whose military ability became legendary during the wars against Fredrick II. Notwithstanding this, being in favour of the Visconti, he was arrested in 1263 and jailed in Milan. In 1276 he was freed in the context of a compromise between the two factions about [[Como]] and after his promise of not acting against the Della Torre. He joined altogether the Visconti army assuming the role of General Captain. The Visconti forces took progressively advantage in the area of Lake Maggiore. In 1276 [[Teobaldo Visconti (1230-1276)|Tebaldo Visconti]], nephew of Ottone, was captured with other leading figures of the Visconti forces. Brought to [[Gallarate]], they were executed by beheading. The Visconti eventually defeated the Della Torre army in the decisive [[Battle of Desio]] on 27 January 1277, opening the way for Ottone to enter in Milan. [[Napoleone della Torre|Napoleone]], son of Pagano, was arrested with other Della Torre family members. He died in jail few months later. These events are generally considered to mark the foundation of the Visconti lordship on Milan.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=67\u201371}}</ref><ref name=\"Jones 619\">{{harvp|Jones|1997|page=619}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ingresso di Ottone Visconti a Milano.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|January 21st 1277, after the victory obtained against the [[Della Torre]] in [[Battle of Desio|Desio]], the archbishop [[Ottone Visconti]] enters in Milan (14th century [[fresco]] in the [[Rocca Borromeo di Angera]])]]\n\nOttone initially granted power in Milan to Simone Orelli, appointing him [[Capitano del popolo|Captain of the People]].

Ottone died in 1295, leaving Matteo Lord of Milan. In 1302, the Della Torre took again the power, forcing Matteo to leave the city. After an intervention of [[Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VII]], appeasing the dispute between the two families, the lordship of the Visconti on Milan was definitely restored in 1311.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=87\u2013100, 109\u2013124}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Menant|2005|pages=117\u2013118}}</ref><ref name=\"Jones 619\"/>\n\n===Rulers and their families===\n====Matteo, Galeazzo, Azzone, Luchino and Giovanni (1311\u20131354)====\nThe reconciliation agreement with the Della Torre, reached in the December 1310 on the initiative of Henry VII, was attended by Matteo, his brother Uberto and their cousin [[Lodrisio Visconti|Ludovico]], also known as Lodrisio.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=109\u2013114}}</ref> In the following years Matteo acted alone as Lord of Milan and after him the authority on the city and on a growing territory in northern and central Italy was assumed by seven members of his offspring along four generations. Matteo ruled for about eleven years, providing to his family the legal basis for the hereditary lordship on Milan and extending the territory under Milanese influence against the traditional opponents of the Visconti: the Della Torre and [[Counts and dukes of Anjou|Anjou]] dynasties allied with the Papacy. After being accused of [[necromancy]] and [[heresy]], he was convicted by the Church. Looking for a reconciliation, he transferred the power to his eldest son [[Galeazzo I Visconti|Galeazzo]] and left Milan for the [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] monastery of [[Crescenzago]], where he died in 1322.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=125\u2013131, 142\u2013146, 152}}</ref>\n\nAfter Matteo's death, Galeazzo associated his brothers Marco, [[Luchino Visconti (died 1349)|Luchino]], [[Stefano Visconti|Stefano]], and [[Giovanni Visconti (archbishop of Milan)|Giovanni]] (a cleric) in the controls of the inherited domains. He died five years later, succeeded by his son [[Azzone Visconti|Azzone]], who ruled between 1329 and 1339. [[Stefano Visconti|Stefano]], married to Valentina Doria from [[Genoa]], died in 1327 under unclear circumstances. He left three children: [[Matteo II Visconti|Matteo]] (Matteo II), [[Bernab\u00f2 Visconti|Bernab\u00f2]] and [[Galeazzo II Visconti|Galeazzo]] (Galeazzo II). Marco felt in disgrace and was killed by hitmen in 1329. The deaths of two brothers restricted the future successions to Luchino, Giovanni (since 1342 archbishop of Milan) and the three sons of Stefano.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=152\u2013154, 163\u2013164, 173\u2013174}}</ref>\n\nDuring Azzone's rule, Lodrisio (the cousin of Matteo who in 1310 attended the reconciliation with the Della Torre) raised against him trying to revert the line of succession in favour of his own family. He obtained the support of the Della Scala family of [[Verona]], but in 1339, in the [[Battle of Parabiago]], he was defeated by an army led by Azzone and backed by his uncles Luchino and Giovanni. When Azzone died, in 1339, the young age of his sons motivated the transfer of the power to his uncle Luchino, who ruled until his death in 1349. During this period the three sons of Stefano were suspected of a conspiracy against him. The archbishop Giovanni sent them away from Milan, saving them from the possible violent reaction of Luchino.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=189\u2013190, 191\u2013192, 207\u2013210}}</ref>\n\nAfter the death of Luchino, the power was transferred to Giovanni. Under his rule the territorial expansion continued (to Genoa and [[Bologna]]) as a result of his diplomacy. Part of his initiatives were the marriages of the sons of Stefano to members of the nearby noble dynasties of northern Italy: in 1340 Matteo II to [[Egidiola Gonzaga]], in 1350 Bernab\u00f2 to [[Beatrice Regina della Scala|Regina Della Scala]] and Galeazzo II to [[Bianca of Savoy]].<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=208, 210\u2013213}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Bueno de Mesquita|1941|pages=6\u20137}}</ref> In 1353 [[Petrarch]] accepted an invitation of Giovanni and moved to Milan, where he lived until 1361.

Their sons Marco and Carlo married respectively Elisabeth of Bavaria and Beatrice of Armagnac. [[Caterina Visconti|Caterina]], another daughter of Bernab\u00f2, married in 1380 her cousin Gian Galeazzo, widow of Isabelle of Valois, who died in 1373 in Pavia while giving birth to her fourth child.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=292\u2013293, 283\u2013284, 333\u2013334}}</ref>\n\nWhen Galeazzo II died in 1378, his son Gian Galeazzo was the only heir of his half of the Visconti territories. Bernab\u00f2, being 28 years older than his nephew, tended to assume a leading role towards him. The two Visconti had different personalities and ruling styles: instinctive, bad tempered and establisher of a terror regime Bernab\u00f2; circumspect and relatively mild to his subjects Gian Galeazzo. In the following years the relationship between the two Visconti progressively deteriorated.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=284\u2013285}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Bueno de Mesquita|1941|pages=13\u201314}}</ref>\n\nFew months after the death of his wife and counselor, Bernab\u00f2 was deposed by his nephew in a coup, probably prepared for years and kept secret. On 5 May 1385, accompanied by his generals ([[Jacopo dal Verme]], Antonio Porro and Guglielmo Bevilacqua) and with a heavy armed escort, Gian Galeazzo moved from Pavia for an apparent pilgrimage journey to Santa Maria del Monte di Velate near [[Varese]]. The following day, passing by Milan, he arranged to meet Bernab\u00f2 for what was expected to be a familiar greeting. Bernab\u00f2, unprotected, was intercepted and arrested. The coup led also to the arrest of two sons of Bernab\u00f2, who were accompanying him.\n\n[[File:L'arresto di Bernab\u00f2 Visconti da parte degli uomini di Gian Galeazzo Visconti.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|May 6th 1385, [[Bernab\u00f2 Visconti]] is arrested by the men of his nephew [[Gian Galeazzo Visconti]] (19th century engrave)]]\n\nThe people living in the domains of Bernab\u00f2, firstly the Milanese, promptly submitted to Gian Galeazzo, an attitude widely attributed to their desire to abandon the ruthless regime under which they had been living. Incarcerated in his own [[Trezzo sull'Adda Castle|castle at Trezzo sull'Adda]], Bernab\u00f2 died few months later after being submitted a poisoned meal.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=289\u2013302}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Bueno de Mesquita|1941|pages=31\u201334}}</ref>\n\n====Gian Galeazzo, sole ruler and Duke of Milan (1385\u20131402)====\nThe death of Bernab\u00f2 left Gian Galeazzo the sole ruler of the Visconti territories. The sons of Bernab\u00f2 arrested with him (Ludovico and Rodolfo) spent the rest of their life in jail; the two still free (Carlo and Mastino) lived far from Milan and never posed a threat to Gian Galeazzo. Only the Della Scala in Verona, the family of their mother, continued to support them, but they ended their life in exile, in [[Bavaria]] and in [[Venice]], after having reached some agreement with their cousin. The younger and unmarried daughters of Bernab\u00f2 (Anglesia, Lucia, Elisabetta) continued their life in Pavia under the care of their sister Caterina, the second wife of Gian Galeazzo, until their wedding.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=333\u2013334, 338}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Bueno de Mesquita|1941|pages=144, 171}}</ref>\n\nFor his court, Gian Galeazzo preferred Pavia to Milan. There he continued to develop the renowned library of the castle and to support the [[University of Pavia|local university]]. The relationship between Gian Galeazzo and the French royal family, interrupted by the death of his first wife Isabelle, was revived by their daughter [[Valentina Visconti|Valentina]], who married in 1389 [[Louis I, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], brother of [[Charles VI of France|Charles VI, King of France]]. The three sons of Gian Galeazzo and Isabelle died before reaching adulthood.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=325\u2013326, 368\u2013371}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Bueno de Mesquita|1941|pages=63\u201368, 79\u201380, 105}}</ref>\n\nGian Galeazzo and Caterina had two sons: [[Gian Maria Visconti|Giovanni Maria]] in 1388 and [[Filippo Maria Visconti|Filippo Maria]] in 1392. In 1395 Gian Galeazzo obtained from the Emperor [[Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia]], for the price of 100,000 florins, the title of Duke of Milan. During the years of his rule, the Visconti domains reached the greatest territorial extension in northern and central Italy. Of all the domains of the previous years only Genoa, ruled by the archbishop Giovanni, remained excluded. After a short disease, the [[Plague (disease)|plague]] or the [[gout]], Gian Galeazzo died on 3 September 1402.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=3119\u20133323, 379\u2013380}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Bueno de Mesquita|1941|pages=173\u2013175, 297\u2013298}}</ref>\n\n====Giovanni Maria and Filippo Maria (1402\u20131447)====\nThe difficulties posed to the Visconti court by the unexpected death of Gian Galeazzo is revealed by the secrecy under which the news of his end was kept. The funeral was held a couple of months after his death. The two sons, being only 12 and 10 years old, remained under the care of their mother Caterina. A Council of Regency with a leading role of [[Facino Cane]], one of the generals of Gian Galeazzo, was set up, but contrasts soon emerged inside it. In 1404 Giovanni Maria formally assumed power. Ruling under the influence of Facino Cane, he forced his mother to leave Milan for [[Monza]]. There, she ended in the hands of two of the illegitimate sons of Bernab\u00f2, who probably caused her death.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=382\u2013395}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Bueno de Mesquita|1941|pages=298\u2013301}}</ref>\n\nWith Giovanni Maria a period of political crisis began. The policy of Facino Cane, who for himself obtained the title of Count of [[Biandrate]], favoured the local powers and led to the fragmentation of the territorial unity. Peripheral regions were lost to nearby powers. This situation ended in 1412 with the death of Facino Cane. Few months later a conspiracy against Giovanni Maria ended his reign and life. In the same year, his brother Filippo Maria married the widow of Facino Cane, the 42-year-old [[Beatrice Lascaris di Tenda|Beatrice of Tenda]], taking advantage of a testamentary disposition in favour of any Visconti that would have married her. The marriage ended with the accusation of adultery to Beatrice, her incarceration and the sentence to death, carried out in the [[Visconti Castle (Binasco)|Binasco castle]] in 1418.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=397\u2013414, 415\u2013416}}</ref>\n\nIn 1428 Filippo Maria secondly married [[Marie of Savoy, Duchess of Milan|Mary of Savoy]], but they never had sons. In 1425 his mistress [[Agnese del Maino|Agnese Del Maino]] gave birth to an illegitimate daughter, [[Bianca Maria Visconti|Bianca Maria]]. Considered by his father his only heir, she grew up with her mother in the [[Visconti Castle (Abbiategrasso)|Abbiategrasso]] and [[Visconti Castle (Cusago)|Cusago]] castles.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=452\u2013453, 457}}</ref> In 1432 Bianca Maria was betrothed to [[Francesco I Sforza|Francesco Sforza]], a condottiero of Filippo Maria. In 1441 she married him, granting him the succession of the Duchy of Milan. A sign of their marriage is visible today in the twin churches of [[Santa Maria Incoronata, Milan|Santa Maria Incoronata]] in Milan.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=457, 484\u2013486}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Facciata Santa Maria Incoronata.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|The twin fa\u00e7ades of [[Santa Maria Incoronata, Milan|Santa Maria Incoronata]] in Milan reveals the addition of a second church, erected by [[Bianca Maria Visconti]] as a sign of the indissolubility of her marriage to [[Francesco I Sforza|Francesco Sforza]], builder of the original church]]\n\n====The heirs of Bianca Maria and Valentina, dukes of Milan (1450\u20131535) ====\nAfter the death of Filippo Maria in 1447 and the short-lived [[Golden Ambrosian Republic|Ambrosian Republic]], in 1450 Francesco Sforza became the new Duke of Milan.

After his death and the short rule of [[Maximilian Sforza]] (1512\u20131515), the Duchy was inherited by his son [[Francis I of France|Francis I]]. After France was defeated by an Imperial-Spanish army in the [[Battle of Pavia]] in 1525, the rule on Milan was assumed again by a Sforza, [[Francesco II Sforza|Francesco II]]. His death and a [[Italian War of 1536\u201338|new war]] led the Duchy of Milan in the hands of [[Philip II of Spain]], bringing to an end the line of succession initiated by Ottone and Matteo Visconti.\n\n===Political developments and territorial hegemony of Milan===\nUnder the rule of the Visconti, the government of the city of Milan underwent profound transformations while its territorial hegemony greatly extended, to suffer a crisis after the death of Gian Galeazzo.\n\nThe lordship of Ottone and Matteo brought to an end the confrontation between noble and popular parties, which had assumed growing violent forms in Milan during the 13th century. The new power of the Visconti relied initially on the combined roles of Archbishop (Ottone) and Captain of the People, along with the authority deriving from the title of Imperial Vicar (Matteo). After Matteo, the rule in the city assumed hereditary nature inside his family, making unnecessary any formal recognition by the communal institutions. The first Visconti claimed an absolute power (''plenitudo potestatis'') comparable to the one preserved to pope and emperor,<ref>{{harvp|Black|2009|pages=38\u201356}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Gamberini|2014|pages=21\u201323}}</ref> culminating with Bernab\u00f2, who openly considered their authorities irrelevant in his dominions.<ref>{{harvp|Black|2009|pages=52\u201353}}</ref> The political change in Milan was part of the general decline of the Commune and the subsequent rise of the [[Signoria]] that affected northern and central Italy along the 13th and 14th centuries.<ref>{{harvp|Jones|1997|pages=152\u2013650}}</ref>\n\nThe annexation of the properties of the Milanese church, which included fortifications like the [[Rocca Borromeo di Angera|Angera]] and Arona castles guarding the Lake Maggiore, was the first step taken by Matteo Visconti to consolidate his power in the territory of the Milanese diocese. This originated a conflict with the Papacy that lasted along the following decades.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|page=132}}</ref><ref name=\"harvp|Gamberini|2014|page=24\">{{harvp|Gamberini|2014|page=24}}</ref> The expansion of the Visconti rule outside the Milanese diocese took advantage of the traditional importance of Milan in northern Italy, reinforced by the leading role played in the Lombard League during the wars against the Hohenstaufen emperors.<ref>{{harvp|Gamberini|2014|pages=19\u201320}}</ref> After the destructions inflicted by Frederick Barbarossa in 1162, in few years the Milanese reconstructed their city and defeated the emperor at [[Battle of Legnano|Legnano]] in 1176, forcing him to the [[Peace of Constance]], which granted autonomy also to the cities allied to Milan.

Regimes in favour of the Visconti were installed in [[Como]], [[Novara]] and Pavia. During this first expansion phase, the Visconti continued to face the opposition of the Guelph League: the Papacy, the Anjou house (sovereigns in southern Italy) and the Della Torre family.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=132\u2013168}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Gamberini|2014|pages=28\u201329}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Visconti XIV century.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|The Visconti dominions around the middle of the 14th century]]\n\nAfter a crisis suffered during the years of Galeazzo I, the expansion continued under the lordship of Azzone with the military support of his uncle Luchino. In 1334 [[Cremona]] surrendered to Azzone. In 1337 Luchino entered in [[Brescia]], allowing Azzone to become Lord of the city. In 1339 Azzone and Luchino defeated in the battle of Parabiago an army formed by their cousin Lodrisio Visconti and the Della Scala family, lords of Verona. In 1341, under the lordship of Luchino, a reconciliation with the Church was reached. In 1346 Luchino took [[Parma]] and in 1347 he extended the western border of the Visconti dominions along a stretch of land until [[Mondov\u00ec]] and [[Cuneo]], at the foot of the [[Western Alps]].<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=191\u2013205}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Black|2009|pages=38\u201342}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Gamberini|2014|page=39}}</ref>\n\nAfter the death of Luchino, the archbishop Giovanni further extended the territories under Milanese control. In 1350 he obtained Bologna from the [[Pepoli|Pepoli family]] and in 1353 he accepted the lordship of Genoa. Through the marriages of his nephews (Matteo II, Bernab\u00f2 and Galeazzo II), he linked dynastically the Visconti to the families ruling the territories to the west and east of the Visconti dominions: the Gonzaga, the Della Scala and the [[House of Savoy|Savoy]]. The acquisition of Bologna, a city belonging to the territory of the [[Papal States]], reopened the conflict with the pope. In 1352, negotiation with the papal envoy, the abbot [[Pope Urban V|Guillaume de Grimoard]] (later Pope Urban V), led to an agreement that allowed Giovanni to continue to rule on Bologna as papal vicar.<ref>{{harvp|Bueno de Mesquita|1941|pages=6\u20137}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Black|2009|pages=42\u201343}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=207\u2013234}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Gamberini|2014|page=30}}</ref>\n\nThe death of the archbishop Giovanni in 1354 and the transfer of power to Bernab\u00f2 and Galeazzo II were followed by a reaction in Genoa and Bologna. In 1356 Genoa regained its independence. In Bologna, the rebellion of Giovanni Visconti di Oleggio, a former prot\u00e9g\u00e9e of the Archbishop Giovanni and his lieutenant in the city, opened the way to the intervention of the [[Gil \u00c1lvarez Carrillo de Albornoz|Cardinal Albornoz]], who in 1360 brought back the city within the Papal States. Bernab\u00f2, ruler of the eastern portion of the Visconti dominions, tried repeatedly to recover Bologna. This, among other disputes with the Church, cost him a sentence of excommunication by [[Pope Innocent VI]]. After his defeat in the Battle of San Ruffillo in 1361, Bernab\u00f2 finally came to term with the loss of Bologna.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=239\u2013240, 248\u2013253}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Black|2009|pages=51\u201352}}</ref> Bernab\u00f2 and Galeazzo II engaged bitter clashes also with the imperial authority. After the [[List of rulers of Montferrat|marquess of Monferrato]] was appointed imperial vicar in Pavia by [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]], the relationship between the emperor and the Visconti deteriorated. In November 1356, in the Battle of [[Casorate Primo|Casorate]], Visconti forces under the command of Lodrisio Visconti (now reconciled with his cousins) defeated an imperial army and captured its commander, [[Marquard of Randeck]]. In 1359, Pavia definitely surrendered to Galeazzo II.<ref>{{harvp|Bueno de Mesquita|1941|pages=7\u20138}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=241\u2013244}}</ref> His decision to erect a vast [[Visconti Castle (Pavia)|castle in Pavia]] and to establish there his court was a sign of the ambition of the Visconti to extend their dominions to the area of the ancient Lombard Kingdom.\n\nIn the 1370s, Bernab\u00f2 and Galeazzo II emerged without severe consequences from manifold simultaneous attacks. The two brothers were deprived by the emperor of their vicariate and condemned by the Pope Gregory XI as heretics. They subsequently suffered military incursions from the eastern border (by the count of Savoy) and from Bologna (by Papal-Florentine forces), which ended without significant impacts. A peace with the pope and a reconciliation with the count of Savoy  followed, while [[Florence]] turned against the pope in a [[War of the Eight Saints|new war]].<ref>{{harvp|Bueno de Mesquita|1941|pages=8\u20139}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Black|2009|pages=52\u201354}}</ref> The years of Bernab\u00f2 and Galeazzo II were marked also by the extension of their matrimonial policies.

The members of the other branches added frequently to their surname the name of the place where they chose to live and where a castle was available for their residence. The first of such cases were the Visconti of [[Massino Visconti|Massino]], the Visconti of [[Invorio]] and the Visconti of [[Oleggio Castello]].<ref>{{harvp|Filippini|2014|pages=62\u201363}}</ref> In these localities the castle ([[Visconti Castle (Massino)|Massino]]), its remains ([[Visconti Castle (Invorio)|Invorio]]) or a later reconstruction of the initial building ([[Dal Pozzo Castle|Oleggio Castello]]) are still today visible.\n\n==Lords and Dukes of Milan==\nThe Visconti ruled Milan until the early [[Renaissance]], first as Lords, then, from 1395, with the mighty [[Gian Galeazzo Visconti|Gian Galeazzo]] who endeavored to unify Northern Italy and [[Tuscany]], as [[Duchy of Milan|Dukes]]. Visconti rule in Milan ended with the death of [[Filippo Maria Visconti]] in 1447. He was succeeded by a [[Ambrosian Republic|short-lived republic]] and then by his son-in-law [[Francesco I Sforza]], who established the reign of the [[House of Sforza]].<ref name=\"harvp|Hale|1981|p=338\u2013341, 352\">{{harvp|Hale|1981|p=338\u2013341, 352}}</ref><ref name=\"harvp|Williams|1998|p=33\u201335\">{{harvp|Williams|1998|p=33\u201335}}</ref>\n\n===Rise to the lordship===\nWith the death of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] in 1250 and the ceasing of the war of the [[Lombard League]] against him, which itself was a reason for the Milanese [[Medieval commune|commune]] to be united in its defence, a period of conflicts between rivaling factions began inside the city. The [[Della Torre]] family progressively acquired power in Milan after 1240, when Pagano Della Torre assumed the leadership of the Credenza di Sant'Ambrogio, a political party with a popular base. This allowed them to have a role in the tax collection of the commune (estimo), which was essential to finance the war against Frederick II while affecting the great landowners. In 1247 Pagano was succeeded by his nephew [[Martino della Torre|Martino Della Torre]]. To underline the preeminence of his position, the new role of Senior of the Credenza (Anziano della Credenza) was created. In this position the Della Torre began to be confronted with the Milanese noble families organized in their own political party, the Societas Capitaneorum et Valvassorum, having the Visconti among the most prominent figures. After a period of unrest between the opposite parties, in 1258 the so-called Sant'Ambrogio Peace was signed among the parties, strengthening the position of La Credenza and La Motta (a second political party with popular tendencies).<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=33\u201345}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Menant|2005|page=67}}</ref>\n\nThe peace was undermined by new events in favour of the Della Torre. At the end of 1259, [[Oberto Pallavicino]], a former partisan of Frederick II who got closer to the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelph]] positions of the Della Torre, was appointed by the Milanese commune for five years in the role of General Captain of the People. Pallavicino's position in Milan was greatly enhanced by the victory he obtained in the [[Battle of Cassano (1259)|Battle of Cassano]] on 16 September 1259, against [[Ezzelino III da Romano|Ezzelino da Romano]], formerly his ally on the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Ghibelline]] side in the war against Milan, the Lombard League and the Papacy. In Ezzelino the noble expelled from Milan during the clashes preceding the Sant'Ambrogio Peace placed their hopes to get back in the city to their old power. In 1264, when Pallavicino left his office (preparing another change of alliance), Martino Della Torre remained the sole ruler of Milan and de facto its Lord.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=45\u201351}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Menant|2005|pages=111\u2013112}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Jones|1997|pages=520\u2013521}}</ref> A decisive event in the confrontation between the Della Torre and the Visconti factions was the appointment of [[Ottone Visconti]] to archbishop of Milan in 1262. Ottone was preferred by [[Urban IV|Pope Urban IV]] to [[Raimondo della Torre|Raimondo]], another candidate member of the Della Torre family. Prevented from assuming his office and forced by the opposite faction to remain outside the city, Ottone tried to settle in Arona, at the border of the Milanese archdiocese. At the end of 1263, Della Torre forces with the support of Oberto Pallavicino dislodged him from Arona. Ottone sought refuge in central Italy near the pope. The Della Torre party under the guidance of Filippo Della Torre, brother of Martino and his successor after 1263, took advantage also of the favour of [[Charles I of Anjou|Charles of Anjou]]. Milan forged an alliance with him and with other northern Italian cities (Guelph League) to fight the [[Hohenstaufen]] rule in southern Italy. Francesco Della Torre led the Milanese expedition in southern Italy, which ended in 1266 with the allied victory against [[Manfred, King of Sicily|Manfred of Sicily]] in the [[Battle of Benevento]]. Charles of Anjou became the new [[List of monarchs of Sicily|King of Sicily]], having also an indirect rule (exercised through the Della Torre) on Milan.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=56\u201362}}</ref>\n\nTrying to take advantage from the favourable moment, in 1266 the Della Torre made an attempt to advocate their cause against the Visconti in a [[Consistory court|consistory]] held by [[Pope Clement IV]] in [[Viterbo]] and attended by the archbishop Ottone. Despite the presence of a delegate of Charles of Anjou the decision of the pope was in favour of Ottone. An attempt was then made by the Pope to appease the Milanese factions by means of an oath of allegiance demanded to the Milanese population. Part of it was the acceptance of Ottone as archbishop. The events however were changed again by new circumstances in favour of the Della Torre. At the end of 1266 in Germany was taken the decision to support [[Conradin]], the last member of the Hohenstaufen dynasty, in an attempt to recover the domains in southern Italy lost after the defeat of Benevento and the death of Manfred of Sicily. This reinstated again the Della Torre in their position of leaders of the Guelph League. Moreover, in 1268, Clement IV died, initiating a period of papal vacancy that left without practical consequences the dispositions in favour of Ottone.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=64\u201367}}</ref>\n\nAfter the definitive end of the Hohenstaufen threat (Conradin was defeated and executed in Naples in 1268), the confrontation between the two Milanese factions assumed more and more a military connotation. A leading figure on the Visconti side was Simone Orelli da Locarno, whose military ability became legendary during the wars against Fredrick II. Notwithstanding this, being in favour of the Visconti, he was arrested in 1263 and jailed in Milan. In 1276 he was freed in the context of a compromise between the two factions about [[Como]] and after his promise of not acting against the Della Torre. He joined altogether the Visconti army assuming the role of General Captain. The Visconti forces took progressively advantage in the area of Lake Maggiore. In 1276 [[Teobaldo Visconti (1230-1276)|Tebaldo Visconti]], nephew of Ottone, was captured with other leading figures of the Visconti forces. Brought to [[Gallarate]], they were executed by beheading. The Visconti eventually defeated the Della Torre army in the decisive [[Battle of Desio]] on 27 January 1277, opening the way for Ottone to enter in Milan. [[Napoleone della Torre|Napoleone]], son of Pagano, was arrested with other Della Torre family members. He died in jail few months later. These events are generally considered to mark the foundation of the Visconti lordship on Milan.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=67\u201371}}</ref><ref name=\"Jones 619\">{{harvp|Jones|1997|page=619}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ingresso di Ottone Visconti a Milano.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|January 21st 1277, after the victory obtained against the [[Della Torre]] in [[Battle of Desio|Desio]], the archbishop [[Ottone Visconti]] enters in Milan (14th century [[fresco]] in the [[Rocca Borromeo di Angera]])]]\n\nOttone initially granted power in Milan to Simone Orelli, appointing him [[Capitano del popolo|Captain of the People]]. In 1287, he transferred this role to his grandnephew [[Matteo I Visconti|Matteo Visconti]] (the son of Tebaldo executed in 1277), who one year later obtained also the title of [[Imperial vicar]] from the emperor [[Rudolf I of Germany|Rudolf of Habsburg]]. Ottone died in 1295, leaving Matteo Lord of Milan. In 1302, the Della Torre took again the power, forcing Matteo to leave the city. After an intervention of [[Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VII]], appeasing the dispute between the two families, the lordship of the Visconti on Milan was definitely restored in 1311.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=87\u2013100, 109\u2013124}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Menant|2005|pages=117\u2013118}}</ref><ref name=\"Jones 619\"/>\n\n===Rulers and their families===\n====Matteo, Galeazzo, Azzone, Luchino and Giovanni (1311\u20131354)====\nThe reconciliation agreement with the Della Torre, reached in the December 1310 on the initiative of Henry VII, was attended by Matteo, his brother Uberto and their cousin [[Lodrisio Visconti|Ludovico]], also known as Lodrisio.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=109\u2013114}}</ref> In the following years Matteo acted alone as Lord of Milan and after him the authority on the city and on a growing territory in northern and central Italy was assumed by seven members of his offspring along four generations. Matteo ruled for about eleven years, providing to his family the legal basis for the hereditary lordship on Milan and extending the territory under Milanese influence against the traditional opponents of the Visconti: the Della Torre and [[Counts and dukes of Anjou|Anjou]] dynasties allied with the Papacy. After being accused of [[necromancy]] and [[heresy]], he was convicted by the Church. Looking for a reconciliation, he transferred the power to his eldest son [[Galeazzo I Visconti|Galeazzo]] and left Milan for the [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] monastery of [[Crescenzago]], where he died in 1322.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=125\u2013131, 142\u2013146, 152}}</ref>\n\nAfter Matteo's death, Galeazzo associated his brothers Marco, [[Luchino Visconti (died 1349)|Luchino]], [[Stefano Visconti|Stefano]], and [[Giovanni Visconti (archbishop of Milan)|Giovanni]] (a cleric) in the controls of the inherited domains. He died five years later, succeeded by his son [[Azzone Visconti|Azzone]], who ruled between 1329 and 1339. [[Stefano Visconti|Stefano]], married to Valentina Doria from [[Genoa]], died in 1327 under unclear circumstances. He left three children: [[Matteo II Visconti|Matteo]] (Matteo II), [[Bernab\u00f2 Visconti|Bernab\u00f2]] and [[Galeazzo II Visconti|Galeazzo]] (Galeazzo II). Marco felt in disgrace and was killed by hitmen in 1329. The deaths of two brothers restricted the future successions to Luchino, Giovanni (since 1342 archbishop of Milan) and the three sons of Stefano.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=152\u2013154, 163\u2013164, 173\u2013174}}</ref>\n\nDuring Azzone's rule, Lodrisio (the cousin of Matteo who in 1310 attended the reconciliation with the Della Torre) raised against him trying to revert the line of succession in favour of his own family. He obtained the support of the Della Scala family of [[Verona]], but in 1339, in the [[Battle of Parabiago]], he was defeated by an army led by Azzone and backed by his uncles Luchino and Giovanni. When Azzone died, in 1339, the young age of his sons motivated the transfer of the power to his uncle Luchino, who ruled until his death in 1349. During this period the three sons of Stefano were suspected of a conspiracy against him. The archbishop Giovanni sent them away from Milan, saving them from the possible violent reaction of Luchino.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=189\u2013190, 191\u2013192, 207\u2013210}}</ref>\n\nAfter the death of Luchino, the power was transferred to Giovanni. Under his rule the territorial expansion continued (to Genoa and [[Bologna]]) as a result of his diplomacy.

Their sons Marco and Carlo married respectively Elisabeth of Bavaria and Beatrice of Armagnac. [[Caterina Visconti|Caterina]], another daughter of Bernab\u00f2, married in 1380 her cousin Gian Galeazzo, widow of Isabelle of Valois, who died in 1373 in Pavia while giving birth to her fourth child.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=292\u2013293, 283\u2013284, 333\u2013334}}</ref>\n\nWhen Galeazzo II died in 1378, his son Gian Galeazzo was the only heir of his half of the Visconti territories. Bernab\u00f2, being 28 years older than his nephew, tended to assume a leading role towards him. The two Visconti had different personalities and ruling styles: instinctive, bad tempered and establisher of a terror regime Bernab\u00f2; circumspect and relatively mild to his subjects Gian Galeazzo. In the following years the relationship between the two Visconti progressively deteriorated.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=284\u2013285}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Bueno de Mesquita|1941|pages=13\u201314}}</ref>\n\nFew months after the death of his wife and counselor, Bernab\u00f2 was deposed by his nephew in a coup, probably prepared for years and kept secret. On 5 May 1385, accompanied by his generals ([[Jacopo dal Verme]], Antonio Porro and Guglielmo Bevilacqua) and with a heavy armed escort, Gian Galeazzo moved from Pavia for an apparent pilgrimage journey to Santa Maria del Monte di Velate near [[Varese]]. The following day, passing by Milan, he arranged to meet Bernab\u00f2 for what was expected to be a familiar greeting. Bernab\u00f2, unprotected, was intercepted and arrested. The coup led also to the arrest of two sons of Bernab\u00f2, who were accompanying him.\n\n[[File:L'arresto di Bernab\u00f2 Visconti da parte degli uomini di Gian Galeazzo Visconti.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|May 6th 1385, [[Bernab\u00f2 Visconti]] is arrested by the men of his nephew [[Gian Galeazzo Visconti]] (19th century engrave)]]\n\nThe people living in the domains of Bernab\u00f2, firstly the Milanese, promptly submitted to Gian Galeazzo, an attitude widely attributed to their desire to abandon the ruthless regime under which they had been living. Incarcerated in his own [[Trezzo sull'Adda Castle|castle at Trezzo sull'Adda]], Bernab\u00f2 died few months later after being submitted a poisoned meal.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=289\u2013302}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Bueno de Mesquita|1941|pages=31\u201334}}</ref>\n\n====Gian Galeazzo, sole ruler and Duke of Milan (1385\u20131402)====\nThe death of Bernab\u00f2 left Gian Galeazzo the sole ruler of the Visconti territories. The sons of Bernab\u00f2 arrested with him (Ludovico and Rodolfo) spent the rest of their life in jail; the two still free (Carlo and Mastino) lived far from Milan and never posed a threat to Gian Galeazzo. Only the Della Scala in Verona, the family of their mother, continued to support them, but they ended their life in exile, in [[Bavaria]] and in [[Venice]], after having reached some agreement with their cousin. The younger and unmarried daughters of Bernab\u00f2 (Anglesia, Lucia, Elisabetta) continued their life in Pavia under the care of their sister Caterina, the second wife of Gian Galeazzo, until their wedding.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=333\u2013334, 338}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Bueno de Mesquita|1941|pages=144, 171}}</ref>\n\nFor his court, Gian Galeazzo preferred Pavia to Milan. There he continued to develop the renowned library of the castle and to support the [[University of Pavia|local university]]. The relationship between Gian Galeazzo and the French royal family, interrupted by the death of his first wife Isabelle, was revived by their daughter [[Valentina Visconti|Valentina]], who married in 1389 [[Louis I, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], brother of [[Charles VI of France|Charles VI, King of France]]. The three sons of Gian Galeazzo and Isabelle died before reaching adulthood.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=325\u2013326, 368\u2013371}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Bueno de Mesquita|1941|pages=63\u201368, 79\u201380, 105}}</ref>\n\nGian Galeazzo and Caterina had two sons: [[Gian Maria Visconti|Giovanni Maria]] in 1388 and [[Filippo Maria Visconti|Filippo Maria]] in 1392. In 1395 Gian Galeazzo obtained from the Emperor [[Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia]], for the price of 100,000 florins, the title of Duke of Milan. During the years of his rule, the Visconti domains reached the greatest territorial extension in northern and central Italy. Of all the domains of the previous years only Genoa, ruled by the archbishop Giovanni, remained excluded. After a short disease, the [[Plague (disease)|plague]] or the [[gout]], Gian Galeazzo died on 3 September 1402.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=3119\u20133323, 379\u2013380}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Bueno de Mesquita|1941|pages=173\u2013175, 297\u2013298}}</ref>\n\n====Giovanni Maria and Filippo Maria (1402\u20131447)====\nThe difficulties posed to the Visconti court by the unexpected death of Gian Galeazzo is revealed by the secrecy under which the news of his end was kept. The funeral was held a couple of months after his death. The two sons, being only 12 and 10 years old, remained under the care of their mother Caterina. A Council of Regency with a leading role of [[Facino Cane]], one of the generals of Gian Galeazzo, was set up, but contrasts soon emerged inside it. In 1404 Giovanni Maria formally assumed power. Ruling under the influence of Facino Cane, he forced his mother to leave Milan for [[Monza]]. There, she ended in the hands of two of the illegitimate sons of Bernab\u00f2, who probably caused her death.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=382\u2013395}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Bueno de Mesquita|1941|pages=298\u2013301}}</ref>\n\nWith Giovanni Maria a period of political crisis began. The policy of Facino Cane, who for himself obtained the title of Count of [[Biandrate]], favoured the local powers and led to the fragmentation of the territorial unity. Peripheral regions were lost to nearby powers. This situation ended in 1412 with the death of Facino Cane. Few months later a conspiracy against Giovanni Maria ended his reign and life. In the same year, his brother Filippo Maria married the widow of Facino Cane, the 42-year-old [[Beatrice Lascaris di Tenda|Beatrice of Tenda]], taking advantage of a testamentary disposition in favour of any Visconti that would have married her. The marriage ended with the accusation of adultery to Beatrice, her incarceration and the sentence to death, carried out in the [[Visconti Castle (Binasco)|Binasco castle]] in 1418.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=397\u2013414, 415\u2013416}}</ref>\n\nIn 1428 Filippo Maria secondly married [[Marie of Savoy, Duchess of Milan|Mary of Savoy]], but they never had sons. In 1425 his mistress [[Agnese del Maino|Agnese Del Maino]] gave birth to an illegitimate daughter, [[Bianca Maria Visconti|Bianca Maria]]. Considered by his father his only heir, she grew up with her mother in the [[Visconti Castle (Abbiategrasso)|Abbiategrasso]] and [[Visconti Castle (Cusago)|Cusago]] castles.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=452\u2013453, 457}}</ref> In 1432 Bianca Maria was betrothed to [[Francesco I Sforza|Francesco Sforza]], a condottiero of Filippo Maria. In 1441 she married him, granting him the succession of the Duchy of Milan. A sign of their marriage is visible today in the twin churches of [[Santa Maria Incoronata, Milan|Santa Maria Incoronata]] in Milan.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=457, 484\u2013486}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Facciata Santa Maria Incoronata.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|The twin fa\u00e7ades of [[Santa Maria Incoronata, Milan|Santa Maria Incoronata]] in Milan reveals the addition of a second church, erected by [[Bianca Maria Visconti]] as a sign of the indissolubility of her marriage to [[Francesco I Sforza|Francesco Sforza]], builder of the original church]]\n\n====The heirs of Bianca Maria and Valentina, dukes of Milan (1450\u20131535) ====\nAfter the death of Filippo Maria in 1447 and the short-lived [[Golden Ambrosian Republic|Ambrosian Republic]], in 1450 Francesco Sforza became the new Duke of Milan.

After his death and the short rule of [[Maximilian Sforza]] (1512\u20131515), the Duchy was inherited by his son [[Francis I of France|Francis I]]. After France was defeated by an Imperial-Spanish army in the [[Battle of Pavia]] in 1525, the rule on Milan was assumed again by a Sforza, [[Francesco II Sforza|Francesco II]]. His death and a [[Italian War of 1536\u201338|new war]] led the Duchy of Milan in the hands of [[Philip II of Spain]], bringing to an end the line of succession initiated by Ottone and Matteo Visconti.\n\n===Political developments and territorial hegemony of Milan===\nUnder the rule of the Visconti, the government of the city of Milan underwent profound transformations while its territorial hegemony greatly extended, to suffer a crisis after the death of Gian Galeazzo.\n\nThe lordship of Ottone and Matteo brought to an end the confrontation between noble and popular parties, which had assumed growing violent forms in Milan during the 13th century. The new power of the Visconti relied initially on the combined roles of Archbishop (Ottone) and Captain of the People, along with the authority deriving from the title of Imperial Vicar (Matteo). After Matteo, the rule in the city assumed hereditary nature inside his family, making unnecessary any formal recognition by the communal institutions. The first Visconti claimed an absolute power (''plenitudo potestatis'') comparable to the one preserved to pope and emperor,<ref>{{harvp|Black|2009|pages=38\u201356}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Gamberini|2014|pages=21\u201323}}</ref> culminating with Bernab\u00f2, who openly considered their authorities irrelevant in his dominions.<ref>{{harvp|Black|2009|pages=52\u201353}}</ref> The political change in Milan was part of the general decline of the Commune and the subsequent rise of the [[Signoria]] that affected northern and central Italy along the 13th and 14th centuries.<ref>{{harvp|Jones|1997|pages=152\u2013650}}</ref>\n\nThe annexation of the properties of the Milanese church, which included fortifications like the [[Rocca Borromeo di Angera|Angera]] and Arona castles guarding the Lake Maggiore, was the first step taken by Matteo Visconti to consolidate his power in the territory of the Milanese diocese. This originated a conflict with the Papacy that lasted along the following decades.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|page=132}}</ref><ref name=\"harvp|Gamberini|2014|page=24\">{{harvp|Gamberini|2014|page=24}}</ref> The expansion of the Visconti rule outside the Milanese diocese took advantage of the traditional importance of Milan in northern Italy, reinforced by the leading role played in the Lombard League during the wars against the Hohenstaufen emperors.<ref>{{harvp|Gamberini|2014|pages=19\u201320}}</ref> After the destructions inflicted by Frederick Barbarossa in 1162, in few years the Milanese reconstructed their city and defeated the emperor at [[Battle of Legnano|Legnano]] in 1176, forcing him to the [[Peace of Constance]], which granted autonomy also to the cities allied to Milan.

Regimes in favour of the Visconti were installed in [[Como]], [[Novara]] and Pavia. During this first expansion phase, the Visconti continued to face the opposition of the Guelph League: the Papacy, the Anjou house (sovereigns in southern Italy) and the Della Torre family.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=132\u2013168}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Gamberini|2014|pages=28\u201329}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Visconti XIV century.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|The Visconti dominions around the middle of the 14th century]]\n\nAfter a crisis suffered during the years of Galeazzo I, the expansion continued under the lordship of Azzone with the military support of his uncle Luchino. In 1334 [[Cremona]] surrendered to Azzone. In 1337 Luchino entered in [[Brescia]], allowing Azzone to become Lord of the city. In 1339 Azzone and Luchino defeated in the battle of Parabiago an army formed by their cousin Lodrisio Visconti and the Della Scala family, lords of Verona. In 1341, under the lordship of Luchino, a reconciliation with the Church was reached. In 1346 Luchino took [[Parma]] and in 1347 he extended the western border of the Visconti dominions along a stretch of land until [[Mondov\u00ec]] and [[Cuneo]], at the foot of the [[Western Alps]].<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=191\u2013205}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Black|2009|pages=38\u201342}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Gamberini|2014|page=39}}</ref>\n\nAfter the death of Luchino, the archbishop Giovanni further extended the territories under Milanese control. In 1350 he obtained Bologna from the [[Pepoli|Pepoli family]] and in 1353 he accepted the lordship of Genoa. Through the marriages of his nephews (Matteo II, Bernab\u00f2 and Galeazzo II), he linked dynastically the Visconti to the families ruling the territories to the west and east of the Visconti dominions: the Gonzaga, the Della Scala and the [[House of Savoy|Savoy]]. The acquisition of Bologna, a city belonging to the territory of the [[Papal States]], reopened the conflict with the pope. In 1352, negotiation with the papal envoy, the abbot [[Pope Urban V|Guillaume de Grimoard]] (later Pope Urban V), led to an agreement that allowed Giovanni to continue to rule on Bologna as papal vicar.<ref>{{harvp|Bueno de Mesquita|1941|pages=6\u20137}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Black|2009|pages=42\u201343}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=207\u2013234}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Gamberini|2014|page=30}}</ref>\n\nThe death of the archbishop Giovanni in 1354 and the transfer of power to Bernab\u00f2 and Galeazzo II were followed by a reaction in Genoa and Bologna. In 1356 Genoa regained its independence. In Bologna, the rebellion of Giovanni Visconti di Oleggio, a former prot\u00e9g\u00e9e of the Archbishop Giovanni and his lieutenant in the city, opened the way to the intervention of the [[Gil \u00c1lvarez Carrillo de Albornoz|Cardinal Albornoz]], who in 1360 brought back the city within the Papal States. Bernab\u00f2, ruler of the eastern portion of the Visconti dominions, tried repeatedly to recover Bologna. This, among other disputes with the Church, cost him a sentence of excommunication by [[Pope Innocent VI]]. After his defeat in the Battle of San Ruffillo in 1361, Bernab\u00f2 finally came to term with the loss of Bologna.<ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=239\u2013240, 248\u2013253}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Black|2009|pages=51\u201352}}</ref> Bernab\u00f2 and Galeazzo II engaged bitter clashes also with the imperial authority. After the [[List of rulers of Montferrat|marquess of Monferrato]] was appointed imperial vicar in Pavia by [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]], the relationship between the emperor and the Visconti deteriorated. In November 1356, in the Battle of [[Casorate Primo|Casorate]], Visconti forces under the command of Lodrisio Visconti (now reconciled with his cousins) defeated an imperial army and captured its commander, [[Marquard of Randeck]]. In 1359, Pavia definitely surrendered to Galeazzo II.<ref>{{harvp|Bueno de Mesquita|1941|pages=7\u20138}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Cognasso|2014|pages=241\u2013244}}</ref> His decision to erect a vast [[Visconti Castle (Pavia)|castle in Pavia]] and to establish there his court was a sign of the ambition of the Visconti to extend their dominions to the area of the ancient Lombard Kingdom.\n\nIn the 1370s, Bernab\u00f2 and Galeazzo II emerged without severe consequences from manifold simultaneous attacks. The two brothers were deprived by the emperor of their vicariate and condemned by the Pope Gregory XI as heretics. They subsequently suffered military incursions from the eastern border (by the count of Savoy) and from Bologna (by Papal-Florentine forces), which ended without significant impacts. A peace with the pope and a reconciliation with the count of Savoy  followed, while [[Florence]] turned against the pope in a [[War of the Eight Saints|new war]].<ref>{{harvp|Bueno de Mesquita|1941|pages=8\u20139}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Black|2009|pages=52\u201354}}</ref> The years of Bernab\u00f2 and Galeazzo II were marked also by the extension of their matrimonial policies.
