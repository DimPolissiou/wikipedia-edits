Two formulas, one for paregoric and another for a similar medication, taken from an 1870 publication, are, for Paregoric: \"''Best opium 1/2 dr., dissolve it in about 2 tablespoons of boiling water; then add benzoic acid 1/2 dr.; oil of anise 1/2 a fluid dr.; clarified honey 1 oz.; camphor gum 1 scruple; alcohol, 76 percent, 11 fluid ozs.; distilled water 4-1/2 fluid ozs.; macerate, (keep warm,) for two weeks.  Dose--For children, 5 to 20 drops, adults, 1 to 2 teaspoons''.\"  The other, for [[Dr Bateman's Pectoral Drops]]\", is: \"''Opium in powder, catechu in powder, camphor gum, red saunders, rasped, of each 1/2 oz.; oil of anise 1 dr.; dilute alcohol, (alcohol of 76 percent, and water in equal proportions,) 1 gal.

Federal law dictated that no more than two (2) ounces of paregoric be dispensed by any pharmacy to the same purchaser within a 48-hour period. Purchasers were also required to sign a register or logbook, and pharmacies were technically required to request identification from any purchaser not personally known to the pharmacist. Some states further limited the sale of paregoric, or banned over-the-counter sales entirely.

They were available [[Over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] without a prescription in many states until the early 1990s, at which time the FDA banned the sale of anti-diarrheal drugs containing kaolin and pectin; also, Donnagel-PG contained tincture of belladonna, which became prescription-only on January 1.  1993. Paregoric is currently{{When|date=April 2015}} listed in the [[United States Pharmacopeia]]. Manufacture of the drug was discontinued for several months beginning in late 2011; however, production and distribution resumed in 2012, so the drug is still available in the United States by prescription. Thus, it is unclear as to whether the lapse in manufacture actually resulted in a shortage of the drug at any time, since prescription drugs are often still available for many months after manufacture has been discontinued. In France, paregoric was available without prescription until 1986; nowadays,{{When|date=April 2015}} it is used to wean infants born to opiate-addicted women.\n\n==Paregoric, U.S.P. formula==\nThe principal active ingredient in Paregoric is powdered opium.

Dick.  5th edition.  New York: Dick & Fitzgerald, Publishers, 1890, page 416.  The Dictionary lists a number of formulas for other opium-based tinctures and compounds, such as: Ammoniated Tincture of Opium, Squibb's Compound Tincture of Opium, Dover's Tincture, McMunn's Elixir of Opium, Murphy's Carminative, Oil of Opium, Battley's Sedative Solution of Opium, and Eisenmann's Opiated Wine of Colchicum.</ref>  A slightly different formula is given in the 1926 pharmacoepia.<ref>The 1926 formula is 4&nbsp;g each of powdered opium, benzoic acid, and camphor; and 5&nbsp; of oil of anise, prepared as a tincture by \"macerating the ingredients in a mixture of 40 cc of glycerin and 950 cc of diluted alcohol, completing the preparation with diluted alcohol.\"  Source: ''The Pharmacoepia of the United States of America'', 10th Decennial revision (U.S.P.

For example, in the United Kingdom the formula for Paregoric, B.P. is tincture of opium 5&nbsp;ml, benzoic acid 500&nbsp;mg, camphor 300&nbsp;mg, anise oil 0.3&nbsp;ml, alcohol (60%) to 100&nbsp;ml, and contains about 1/30th grain of anhydrous morphine in 60 [[minim (unit)|minims]],<ref name=\"TheExtra\" /> which is 25% stronger than Paregoric, U.S.P.\n\n==Dosage==\nParegoric is sometimes confused with [[Laudanum]], because their chemical names are similar: Camphorated Tincture of Opium (Paregoric) vs. Tincture of Opium (Laudanum).  However, Laudanum contains 10 milligrams of morphine per milliliter, 25 times more than Paregoric.

In particular, \"the difference between a minim and a drop should be borne in mind when figuring doses.

Similarly, at a cost of $36 per pint, \"Opium Concentrated, for U.S.P.

Federal law dictated that no more than two (2) ounces of paregoric be dispensed by any pharmacy to the same purchaser within a 48-hour period. Purchasers were also required to sign a register or logbook, and pharmacies were technically required to request identification from any purchaser not personally known to the pharmacist. Some states further limited the sale of paregoric, or banned over-the-counter sales entirely. For example, Michigan law allowed over-the-counter (non-prescription) sale of paregoric until April 1964, but still allowed OTC sales of certain exempt cough medication preparations that contain 60&nbsp;mg of codeine per fluid ounce.\"<ref name=\"unodc\" /> Even where legally permissible by law, OTC sale of paregoric was subject to the discretion of individual pharmacists.\n\nIn 1970, paregoric was classified as a [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedule III controlled substances|Schedule III]] drug under the [[Controlled Substances Act]] (DEA #9809);<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/schedules/orangebook/c_cs_alpha.pdf|title=DEA #9809 is for an \"opium combination product 25 mg/du\" (that is, 25 mg per dosage unit) under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, which includes Paregoric; see www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov, visited July 12, 2010.|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417085659/http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/schedules/orangebook/c_cs_alpha.pdf|archivedate=April 17, 2016}}</ref> however, drugs that contained a mixture of kaolin, pectin, and paregoric (e.g., Donnagel-PG, Parepectolin, and their generic equivalents) were classified as [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedule V controlled substances|Schedule V]] drugs. They were available [[Over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] without a prescription in many states until the early 1990s, at which time the FDA banned the sale of anti-diarrheal drugs containing kaolin and pectin; also, Donnagel-PG contained tincture of belladonna, which became prescription-only on January 1.  1993. Paregoric is currently{{When|date=April 2015}} listed in the [[United States Pharmacopeia]]. Manufacture of the drug was discontinued for several months beginning in late 2011; however, production and distribution resumed in 2012, so the drug is still available in the United States by prescription. Thus, it is unclear as to whether the lapse in manufacture actually resulted in a shortage of the drug at any time, since prescription drugs are often still available for many months after manufacture has been discontinued. In France, paregoric was available without prescription until 1986; nowadays,{{When|date=April 2015}} it is used to wean infants born to opiate-addicted women.\n\n==Paregoric, U.S.P. formula==\nThe principal active ingredient in Paregoric is powdered opium. In the United States the formula for Paregoric, U.S.P. is tincture of [[opium]] 40&nbsp;ml, [[anise oil]] 4&nbsp;ml, [[benzoic acid]] 4&nbsp;g, [[camphor]] 4&nbsp;g, [[glycerin]] 40&nbsp;ml, alcohol 450&nbsp;ml, purified water 450&nbsp;ml, diluted alcohol<ref>Diluted alcohol is a mixture of equal portions of purified water and 190 proof alcohol (95% alcohol by volume).</ref> to 1000&nbsp;ml, and contains the equivalent of 0.4&nbsp;mg/ml of [[anhydrous]] [[morphine]]; one ounce of paregoric contains 129.6&nbsp;mg (2 grains) of powdered opium, or the equivalent of 13&nbsp;mg of anhydrous morphine.<ref name=\"TheExtra\">''The Extra Pharmacoepia Martindale'', Vol. 1, 24th Edition.

For example, one formula for \"Camphorated Tincture of Opium (Paregoric Elixir)\" attributed to the ''United States Pharmacoepia of 1863'' is: \"Macerate 1 drachm each powdered opium and benzoic acid, 1 fluid drachm of anise, 2 ounces clarified honey, and 2 scruples camphor, in 2 pints diluted alcohol for 7 days, and filter through paper.\"<ref>''Encyclopedia of Practical Receipts and Processes'', by William B. Dick.  5th edition.  New York: Dick & Fitzgerald, Publishers, 1890, page 416.  The Dictionary lists a number of formulas for other opium-based tinctures and compounds, such as: Ammoniated Tincture of Opium, Squibb's Compound Tincture of Opium, Dover's Tincture, McMunn's Elixir of Opium, Murphy's Carminative, Oil of Opium, Battley's Sedative Solution of Opium, and Eisenmann's Opiated Wine of Colchicum.</ref>  A slightly different formula is given in the 1926 pharmacoepia.<ref>The 1926 formula is 4&nbsp;g each of powdered opium, benzoic acid, and camphor; and 5&nbsp; of oil of anise, prepared as a tincture by \"macerating the ingredients in a mixture of 40 cc of glycerin and 950 cc of diluted alcohol, completing the preparation with diluted alcohol.\"  Source: ''The Pharmacoepia of the United States of America'', 10th Decennial revision (U.S.P. X), official from January 1, 1926.  Philadelphia: J. B. Lippincott Company, 1925, page 401.</ref>\n\nThe current formula for Paregoric, U.S.P. should not be assumed to be universal.  For example, in the United Kingdom the formula for Paregoric, B.P. is tincture of opium 5&nbsp;ml, benzoic acid 500&nbsp;mg, camphor 300&nbsp;mg, anise oil 0.3&nbsp;ml, alcohol (60%) to 100&nbsp;ml, and contains about 1/30th grain of anhydrous morphine in 60 [[minim (unit)|minims]],<ref name=\"TheExtra\" /> which is 25% stronger than Paregoric, U.S.P.\n\n==Dosage==\nParegoric is sometimes confused with [[Laudanum]], because their chemical names are similar: Camphorated Tincture of Opium (Paregoric) vs. Tincture of Opium (Laudanum).  However, Laudanum contains 10 milligrams of morphine per milliliter, 25 times more than Paregoric. Confusion between the two drugs has led to overdose and death in patients.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wharton |first=Francis |date=1855 |title= A Treatise on the Law of Homicide: To Which is Appended A Series of Leading Cases on Homicide, Now Out of Print, or Existing Only as Manuscript|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CYQsAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA144&dq=Paregoric#v=onepage&q&f=false |location= |publisher=Philadelphia: Kay & Brother, 17 & 19 South Fifth Street, East Side |page=144 |isbn= |author-link= |quote=\"Upon an indictment for the manslaughter of a child, it appeared that the child being ill, the mother sent to a chemist for a pennyworth of paregoric; the chemist's apprentice delivered a phial, with a paregoric label on it, but with laudanum in it; and the mother, supposing it to be a paregoric, gave the child six or seven drops, which killed it.

Care and caution should always be taken in administering doses of Tincture of Opium, such as the use of a dosage syringe or other suitable measurement device, and by pharmacists in preparing Paregoric from Laudanum, and to note that the dosages noted here refer to Apothecaries weight and fluid measure.  In particular, \"the difference between a minim and a drop should be borne in mind when figuring doses.  A minim is always a sixtieth part of a fluid drachm regardless of the character of the substance, while a drop varies from a forty-fifth to a two-hundred-and-fiftieth part, according to the surface tension of the fluid.\"<ref>''The Art of Compounding'', by Wilbur S.

These go as far as to include a [[Cannibalism|cannibalistic]] taste for human infants and [[Dwarfism|midgets]], whom he gluttonously calls, \"The ''other'', [[Pork. The Other White Meat|other white meat]]\". In ''[[Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me]]'', he boasts that he once ate a baby, and tries to refuse Dr. Evil's money for his services in exchange for getting to eat [[Mini-Me]]. He also has the same Scottish accent as [[Shrek (character)|Shrek]] (also voiced by Myers), whose movie was released in 2001, two years after ''The Spy Who Shagged Me'' (and a year before ''Goldmember'' in 2002).\n\n==Appearances==\n===''Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me''===\nFat Bastard had stolen Austin's [[Mojo (African-American culture)|mojo]] in 1969, as he is a guard in the facility, and has knocked out the other guards using bagpipes that spray gas, leaving Austin [[Erectile dysfunction|impotent]] in 1999.

After tearfully telling Austin and Foxxy that he's happy as a sumo wrestler, he farts. Austin asks him if he soiled himself. Fat bastard replies \"maybe\" and laughs. He then jokes about how it sounded wet and tries to smell it. he is disgusted by how it smells, stating it smells like ''Carrots in throw up''.\n\nBy the end of ''[[Austin Powers in Goldmember]]'', he has lost his excessive weight, crediting it to the [[Jared Fogle|Subway diet]], even citing [[Jared Fogle]] as a hero. However, he points out that he still has a lot of excess skin, further noting the resemblance of his neck to a [[vagina]]. On the film [[audio commentary]], Mike Myers says that Fat Bastard probably will not stay thin (as \"Thin Bastard\", as he called him) and would most likely return to his overweight state.\n\n===Popular culture and DirecTV commercial===\n* Beginning in June 2006, this character was in a [[DirecTV]] commercial with [[Mini-Me]]. The plot was that he was talking about how Mini-Me was looking good to eat, like in the movies (see above). Mini-Me thinks that he is crazy. He also uses two of his lines from the movie. His famous line in this commercial is \"Come on, get in my belly!\"\n* On an episode of [[Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue]] titled \"In the Freeze Zone\", the monster Freezard references Fat Bastard by saying \"Get in my Belly!\".

Fat Bastard then says he did the [[Zone diet]], stating that \"carbs are the enemy,\" though the Zone Diet promotes equal amounts of carbs and protein and Fat Bastard probably meant the [[Atkins diet]], which emphasizes low carbs. After tearfully telling Austin and Foxxy that he's happy as a sumo wrestler, he farts. Austin asks him if he soiled himself. Fat bastard replies \"maybe\" and laughs. He then jokes about how it sounded wet and tries to smell it. he is disgusted by how it smells, stating it smells like ''Carrots in throw up''.\n\nBy the end of ''[[Austin Powers in Goldmember]]'', he has lost his excessive weight, crediting it to the [[Jared Fogle|Subway diet]], even citing [[Jared Fogle]] as a hero. However, he points out that he still has a lot of excess skin, further noting the resemblance of his neck to a [[vagina]]. On the film [[audio commentary]], Mike Myers says that Fat Bastard probably will not stay thin (as \"Thin Bastard\", as he called him) and would most likely return to his overweight state.\n\n===Popular culture and DirecTV commercial===\n* Beginning in June 2006, this character was in a [[DirecTV]] commercial with [[Mini-Me]]. The plot was that he was talking about how Mini-Me was looking good to eat, like in the movies (see above). Mini-Me thinks that he is crazy. He also uses two of his lines from the movie. His famous line in this commercial is \"Come on, get in my belly!\"\n* On an episode of [[Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue]] titled \"In the Freeze Zone\", the monster Freezard references Fat Bastard by saying \"Get in my Belly!\". One of the show's stars, [[Michael Chaturantabut]], would make a cameo appearance in [[Austin Powers in Goldmember]], as a gunman at the pool area.\n* On an episode of [[WWE SmackDown|WWF SmackDown!]] (aired Thursday, April 13, 2000), Professional wrestler, [[Big Show (wrestler)|The Big Show]] dresses as Fat Bastard and reveals what's under the kilt, much to [[Kurt Angle]]'s disgusted chagrin. Commentator [[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]] suggested it was a thong.\n\n{{quote\n| text   = I like to be funny, I like to entertain. But I'm in the body of a monstrous killer. So, doesn't quite compute.\n| sign   = The Big Show\n| source = The Best of SmackDown: 10th Anniversary, commenting on the matter\n}}\n\n==Censorship==\nIn reviews for the movie in the newspapers, film critic [[Roger Ebert]] referred to him as ''\"We can't even say his name!\"'', while others called him ''\"Obese Illegitimate Child\"''.\n\nThe mass retail [[action figure]]s sold of the character had the name \"Fat Man\" on the box, even though the patch on his blazer clearly displayed \"FB\". Specialty stores such as [[comic book]] shops had figures in packaging which referred to him as \"Fat Bastard\", however.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote|Austin Powers (film series)|Fat Bastard}}\n\n{{Austin Powers movies}}\n\n[[Category:Austin Powers characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional British Army personnel]]\n[[Category:Fictional cannibals]]\n[[Category:Film characters introduced in 1999]]\n[[Category:Fictional henchmen]]\n[[Category:Fictional Scottish people]]\n[[Category:Fictional sumo wrestlers]]\n[[Category:Male film villains]]\n", "name_user": "2604:2000:1241:8c6:f01b:6662:20b3:c8eb", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat_Bastard"}

The Caracu accounts for less than 5% of Brazilian beef cattle; the [[Nelore]] breed is by far the predominant breed in Brazil.\n\n==Origin==\nThe Caracu breed is from cattle imported from the Iberian peninsula and possibly with some influence from African cattle from the Moorish occupation of the area. The first entry of such animals occurred in 1534 in S\u00e3o Vicente-SP where for several centuries faced all kinds of difficulties in feeding and parasites. This natural pressure evolved into the Criollo such as the yellow Caracu.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://procreare.com.br/a-raca-caracu/|title=A Ra\u00e7a Caracu|accessdate=31 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n==The Caracu in Brazil==\n\nThe arrival of zebu from India in the 19th and 20th century almost led to its extinction. The Caracu is the most suitable European race to tropical conditions found in Brazil. With more than four centuries of selection, Caracu today brings important qualities and increasingly sought after in the beef cattle segment, mainly for industrial crossing.\n\nThe rusticity acquired over the years has resulted in a small food requirements, greater resistance to pests, and increased the longevity of cows. The Caracu is considered the most suitable Taurine breed for the tropical conditions found in Brazil.\n\nSince 1980 the Caracu has been upgraded via the most modern selection techniques for  genetic improvement, led by the Brazilian Association of Caracu Breeders (ABCC). Major industry initiatives such as the Animal Science Institute of Sertaozinho (IZ), Embrapa - Beef Cattle (Campo Grande / MS) and the Agronomic Institute of Paran\u00e1 (IAPAR), carry out studies and research related to the breed. In less than 30 years Caracu presented an accelerated evolution of performance in many ways, always keeping intact its rustic features.\n\n==Characteristics==\n\nThe Caracu of European origin (Bos Taurus) is extraordinary in its adaptation to tropical and sub-tropical climate. The Natural Selection for almost 5 centuries in Brazil resulted in anatomical and physiological changes that provided the following characteristics:\n\n    Short hair suitable for the Brazilian climate\n    Resistance to heat, and climatic and environmental adversities\n    Resistance to endo- and ectoparasites\n    Good locomotion\n    Strong legs and hoof resistant to both hard floors and wet conditions\n    Ability to digest coarse fibers\n    Calving ease\n    Great adaptability to the severest environment\n    High foreskin ideal for Brazilian pastures\n\n==Fertility==\n\nFemales have high fertility rates, good body structure, easy calving, good production of quality milk and good conformation. The excellent maternal ability is a characteristic sought for in crossbreeding makes the breed one of the most recommended for use in crossbreeding.\n\nFemales can be bred in 14-15 months old. Cows can be kept breeding until 16-17 years with some up to 21 years old. Average per cow are from 11 to 13 births.\n\nIn addition, the race of females present:\n\n    Fertility more than 80%\n    F1 females have 10% more fertility and 20% more weight at weaning;\n    Calving ease, with calves being born with an average of 32 kg.\n    Females have their first breeding service at 15 months\n    First calving between 24 and 28 months. \n\n==Weight==\n\nUnder exclusively pasture regime, the average weight of cows is around 550-650 kg with some reaching up to 750 kg. The Bulls weigh around 1,000 kg. and up to 1200 kg. At two years old heifers reach about 400 kg., with some weigh up to 500 kg. Calves at one year old reach an average of 300 kg. due to good maternal ability of cows.\n\nIn relation to meat quality, the Caracu have meat tenderness and desirable juiciness. Caracu crosses maintain the advantages with heterosis. Even compared to 5/8 synthetic races, the bull maintain strength through heterosis - 100% in the half-blood calves.\n\n==Milk==\n\nThe Caracu selected for dairy production provide around 2,100 kilos per lactation (including heifers in 1st lactation) on pasture with little supplementation. Milk fat content is around 5%.\n\n==Behavior==\n\nThe Caracu is a gentle and docile cattle, which facilitates the management of the herd in the field. The Caracu herd moves around in the pasture. It spreads, decreasing the intensity of trampling, allowing a better use and longevity of the pasture. In cold regions, cattle penetrates the woods, consuming leaves and protecting itself from the cold. In the Brazilian cerrado in the period of food shortages (drought), it complements its diet with a variety of native shrubs.\n\n==Crossbreeding==\n\nThe breed is currently used for crosses, mainly on zebu cows in the areas of extensive production. Being a Bos Taurus (European) it breeds a mestizo with a high degree of heterosis with Zebu cattle (Bos indicus). The results have been encouraging as competing on equal terms with specialized breeds in quality and productivity of its mestizos. It takes advantage especially in areas where the system is pasture based.\n\nBulls give good results in crossbreeding the field, and the Caracu is one of the few European races that perform well in natural breeding in the tropics.\n\nAnother fact that demonstrates its multifunctionality is that it can be used at rotation crossbreeding with F1 females (1/2 blood) from other breeds, maintaining the good heterosis. The Caracu has been widely used in the formation of suitable cattle composite breeds.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of breeds of cattle]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.gadocaracu.com.br/racacaracu.htm#2 Caracu] {{in lang|en}}\n* [http://www.abccaracu.com.br/ Association official site] {{in lang|pt}}\n{{Commons category|Caracu}}\n\n{{Cattle breeds of Brazil}}\n[[Category:Beef cattle breeds]]\n[[Category:Cattle breeds originating in Brazil]]\n[[Category:Cattle breeds]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Boi caracu no pasto.JPG|300px|right|thumb|]]\n'''Caracu''' is a [[Brazil]]ian dual purpose (beef and dairy) cattle breed known for its adaptability, hardiness and excellent maternal ability.\n.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dspace.uevora.pt/rdpc/handle/10174/3874|title=Reposit\u00f3rio Digital de Publica\u00e7\u00f5es Cient\u00edficas: Behavioral aspects of Caracu and Red Angus cattle breeds in a pasture with shade and water immersion|publisher=Dspace.uevora.pt|accessdate=13 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecattlesite.com/breeds/beef/72/caracu|title=The Cattle Site - Breeds - Caracu|work=The Cattle Site|accessdate=13 December 2014}}</ref> Like the [[Mocho Nacional]], the Caracu is a tropical European breed created in Brazil and its origin is of the race [[Minhota cattle|Minhota]].<ref>Aristeu Mendes Peixoto, Francisco Ferraz de Toledo.

{"title_page": "Saltwater aquaponics", "text_new": "'''Saltwater aquaponics''' (also known as '''marine aquaponics''') is a combination of plant cultivation and [[Fish farming|fish rearing]] (also called aquaculture), systems with similarities to standard [[aquaponics]], except that it uses saltwater instead of the more commonly used freshwater. In some instances, this may be diluted saltwater. The concept is being researched as a sustainable way to eliminate the stresses that are put on local environments by conventional fish farming practices who expel wastewater into the coastal zones, all while creating complementary crops. \n\nThe practice is a careful balance between the ideal salinity conditions for the aquatic species and the maximum allowable salinity levels for the crops that filter the water and create their own yields.\n\n=== History of the Practice and Current State of Direction ===\nCurrently, many conventional fish farming practices take place in the coastal zones with open circulation. This places an enormous load of urine and soluble nitrogen (that the feed and waste from fish release) at high concentrations into the ecological region. This can have many environmentally deleterious effects. In response to this, alternative aquaculture developments are quickly arising- Namely, recirculating aquaculture systems. By creating a closed system, fish farming has given locational freedom to the practice allowing for more inland developments.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.3390/w8120598|title=The Development of Sustainable Saltwater-Based Food Production Systems: A Review of Established and Novel Concepts|journal=Water|volume=8|issue=12|pages=598|year=2016|last1=Gunning|first1=Daryl|last2=Maguire|first2=Julie|last3=Burnell|first3=Gavin|doi-access=free}}</ref>{{pred}}\n\nIn countries like Japan, saltwater species are much more popular than freshwater fish which has spurred much of the desire for saltwater aquaponics systems.<ref name=\"Takeuchi 2017\">Takeuchi, Toshio. Application of Recirculating Aquaculture Systems in Japan. Springer, 2017.</ref>\n\nThe mainstream system for fish cultivation has also been mono-aquaculture (only one kind of fish/organism). With this method, oxygen consumption by the cultured fish increases, and the load of carbon dioxide becomes heavier. In addition, nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphates from feces or remaining fish feed, dissolve in the seawater, making it [[eutrophic]]. This causes [[Red tide|red tides]], fish pathologies, and oxygen deficiency in seawater, resulting in the mass mortality of fish, auto-pollution, etc.<ref name=\"Takeuchi 2017\"/>\n\nIn response poly-eco-aquaculture looks to create symbiosis by establishing seaweeds throughout the year to create an artificial sea forest around the cultured fish cages. The seaweed takes up nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphate from fish feces and remaining feed and gives off oxygen. The seaweed also inhibits pathogenic bacteria and red tide organisms. Grown seaweeds will then be fed to fish and urchins. \n\nOther organisms which can be produced in these systems include sea cucumber which can be grown in symbiosis with abalone in aquaculture net cages as well. Feces generated by the abalone are fed to sea cucumber. Scallops can also be cultured because they eat organic suspended substances, such as the remaining feed and fish feces. \n\nEnvironmentally sound poly-eco-aquaculture enables the preservation of aquatic environments to be compatible with that of sustainable aquaculture. With this method, healthy fish can be cultured in purified water while productively recycling seaweed to feed the fish.<ref name=\"Takeuchi 2017\"/>\n\n== Parts ==\n\n=== Plants ===\nEdible [[Halophyte|halophytes]] that can be grown in hydroponic systems include [[Tetragonia tetragonoides|New Zealand spinach]], [[Mesembryanthemum crystallinum|common ice plant]], common [[glasswort]], [[barley]], [[rice]], and [[Swiss Chard|swiss chard]].

In some instances, this may be diluted saltwater. The concept is being researched as a sustainable way to eliminate the stresses that are put on local environments by conventional fish farming practices who expel wastewater into the coastal zones, all while creating complementary crops. \n\nThe practice is a careful balance between the ideal salinity conditions for the aquatic species and the maximum allowable salinity levels for the crops that filter the water and create their own yields.\n\n=== History of the Practice and Current State of Direction ===\nCurrently, many conventional fish farming practices take place in the coastal zones with open circulation. This places an enormous load of urine and soluble nitrogen (that the feed and waste from fish release) at high concentrations into the ecological region. This can have many environmentally deleterious effects. In response to this, alternative aquaculture developments are quickly arising- Namely, recirculating aquaculture systems. By creating a closed system, fish farming has given locational freedom to the practice allowing for more inland developments.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.3390/w8120598|title=The Development of Sustainable Saltwater-Based Food Production Systems: A Review of Established and Novel Concepts|journal=Water|volume=8|issue=12|pages=598|year=2016|last1=Gunning|first1=Daryl|last2=Maguire|first2=Julie|last3=Burnell|first3=Gavin|doi-access=free}}</ref>{{pred}}\n\nIn countries like Japan, saltwater species are much more popular than freshwater fish which has spurred much of the desire for saltwater aquaponics systems.<ref name=\"Takeuchi 2017\">Takeuchi, Toshio.

Different portions of the display are darkened/activated at different times to provide animation.\n\nThe mirror has minor tilt adjustment and can be pushed up against the unit for protection and storage.

Some games allow for a special lens to be used with this particular R-Zone and simply provide the user with a non-animated color background. Game movement on screen is black. The screen is considerably larger than the other R-Zone models;<ref name=EGM89/> because of this, and the fact that the user is not required to look at a mirror at a precise angle to see the gameplay, other people can also see gameplay. The unit changed the layout again and requires 4 D batteries to run. In this model the [[D-pad]] was swapped out for four directional buttons (up, down, left, and right).\n* \"X.P.G. Xtreme Pocket Game\" (1997) is a completely handheld version of the console.<ref name=\"vintage\" /> It lacks a headset, and instead projects the display onto a mirrored surface directly above the game controller area on the unit. This version also uses AAA batteries.\n* The R-Zone DataZone was released in late 1996. It is another handheld version of the console, but includes a [[Personal digital assistant|data organizer]].<ref name=EGM89/> It no longer projects the image through a mirror but rather just flat displays it with a backlight. It uses one watch battery to store data and 2 AAA batteries to run the game portion.\n\n==Reception==\nAt the time of its release, David Jones of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' called the R-Zone \"a waste of time and money\" and wrote that its screen \"is hard to see and the controls are very awkward. That's not all \u2013 if you keep the head band on for, say, five minutes, you'll have two deep lines on your fore-head and a headache\". Jones noted the failure of the R-Zone's extra head-band padding \u2013 which was designed to prevent pain \u2013 and concluded, \"The R-Zone should be dumped into the trash can where it belongs\".<ref name=nov28/> ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' remarked that while the display takes time to get used to and is not \"even in the same league as the Virtual Boy's immersive experience,\" the R-Zone is much less expensive and, unlike the Virtual Boy, is functionally portable.<ref name=EGM77/>\n\nIn 2008, Mikel Reparaz of [[GamesRadar+]] included the R-Zone on a list of the 10 worst game consoles released up to that time. Reparaz considered the R-Zone to be a poor version of Nintendo's Virtual Boy and stated that it was essentially \"just a gimmicky version of the same awful, clicky-beepy [[LCD games]] that Tiger had been dumping on the market since the '80s.\"<ref name=Radar>{{cite news|last=Reparaz|first=Mikel|title=The 10 worst consoles ever|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/the-10-worst-consoles-ever/5/|accessdate=November 25, 2017|work=GamesRadar+|date=February 23, 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, [[Motherboard (website)|Motherboard]] called the R-Zone, \"Perhaps the most infamous product ever associated with Tiger\", stating that the console's games \"were glorified versions\" of Tiger's LCD games.

The buttons on the bottom are labeled \"ON\", \"START\", \"SELECT\", \"SOUND\", \"PAUSE\", and \"OFF\". The functions of these face buttons are universal and do not vary from game-to-game. The \"ON\" button simply turns on the console but is largely un-used as inserting a game [[ROM cartridge|cartridge]] automatically turns the unit on. The \"START\" button is required to begin all games. The \"SOUND\" button toggles the audio on and off. The \"PAUSE\" button allows for any game to be paused. The \"OFF\" button turns the console off.\n\nThe R-Zone also features a [[D-pad|directional pad]], allowing four directions of movement in its games.\n\n[[File:Tiger-RZone-XPG-FL.jpg|thumb|The R-Zone X.P.G. (Xtreme Pocket Game) model]]\nThe R-Zone game cartridges are transparent in the center. This allows light to pass through and reflect off a specialized mirror to the gamer's eyes. The LCD in each cartridge operates identically to Tiger's earlier handheld LCD game units. All of the graphics were pre-drawn and permanently set into the LCD itself. Different portions of the display are darkened/activated at different times to provide animation.\n\nThe mirror has minor tilt adjustment and can be pushed up against the unit for protection and storage. The games only display a dark red color.\n\nThe bottom side of the console shows two ports (one on the left side, the other on the right). Each port is accessible with a screwdriver and holds the batteries.\n\nA single speaker allows for mono audio output.\n\n==Variations==\nA few variations of the R-Zone were produced:\n\n[[File:Tiger-RZone-SuperScreen-Closed-FL.jpg|thumb|The R-Zone SuperScreen model, which used lighted rear-projection.]]\n\n*The R-Zone Headgear was released in late 1995 and is largely different from later units in that the game cartridge is inserted into a device that is strapped onto the user's head.<ref name=\"EGM77\">{{cite magazine|last=|first=|date=December 1995|title=In the Zone: A Miniature Virtual-Reality System for $30|url=https://retrocdn.net/images/8/80/EGM_US_077.pdf|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|publisher=Sendai Publishing|issue=77|page=26|pages=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> The user flips down a transparent lens that was designed to reflect the game images into the user's right eye.

The controller requires 4 [[AAA battery|AAA batteries]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.museo8bits.es/fotos/main.php?g2_itemId=898|title=PIC_0928_R-Zone|last=|first=|date=|work=museo8bits.es|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180117131759/http://www.museo8bits.es/fotos/main.php?g2_itemId=898|archive-date=January 17, 2018|access-date=}}</ref> and sports a cartridge storage slot (for keeping an additional game protected and available), volume adjustment dial, and brightness adjustment dial. The console was priced $29.99 at launch and included a [[pack-in game]].<ref name=EGM77/>\n*The R-Zone Super Screen was released in late 1996 and initially cost $29.99.<ref name=\"EGM89\">{{cite magazine|last=|first=|date=December 1996|title=Tidbits...|url=https://retrocdn.net/images/9/9e/EGM_US_089.pdf|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|issue=89|page=24|pages=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> It allowed R-Zone games to have color for the first time. Some games allow for a special lens to be used with this particular R-Zone and simply provide the user with a non-animated color background. Game movement on screen is black. The screen is considerably larger than the other R-Zone models;<ref name=EGM89/> because of this, and the fact that the user is not required to look at a mirror at a precise angle to see the gameplay, other people can also see gameplay. The unit changed the layout again and requires 4 D batteries to run. In this model the [[D-pad]] was swapped out for four directional buttons (up, down, left, and right).\n* \"X.P.G. Xtreme Pocket Game\" (1997) is a completely handheld version of the console.<ref name=\"vintage\" /> It lacks a headset, and instead projects the display onto a mirrored surface directly above the game controller area on the unit. This version also uses AAA batteries.\n* The R-Zone DataZone was released in late 1996. It is another handheld version of the console, but includes a [[Personal digital assistant|data organizer]].<ref name=EGM89/> It no longer projects the image through a mirror but rather just flat displays it with a backlight. It uses one watch battery to store data and 2 AAA batteries to run the game portion.\n\n==Reception==\nAt the time of its release, David Jones of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' called the R-Zone \"a waste of time and money\" and wrote that its screen \"is hard to see and the controls are very awkward. That's not all \u2013 if you keep the head band on for, say, five minutes, you'll have two deep lines on your fore-head and a headache\". Jones noted the failure of the R-Zone's extra head-band padding \u2013 which was designed to prevent pain \u2013 and concluded, \"The R-Zone should be dumped into the trash can where it belongs\".<ref name=nov28/> ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' remarked that while the display takes time to get used to and is not \"even in the same league as the Virtual Boy's immersive experience,\" the R-Zone is much less expensive and, unlike the Virtual Boy, is functionally portable.<ref name=EGM77/>\n\nIn 2008, Mikel Reparaz of [[GamesRadar+]] included the R-Zone on a list of the 10 worst game consoles released up to that time. Reparaz considered the R-Zone to be a poor version of Nintendo's Virtual Boy and stated that it was essentially \"just a gimmicky version of the same awful, clicky-beepy [[LCD games]] that Tiger had been dumping on the market since the '80s.\"<ref name=Radar>{{cite news|last=Reparaz|first=Mikel|title=The 10 worst consoles ever|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/the-10-worst-consoles-ever/5/|accessdate=November 25, 2017|work=GamesRadar+|date=February 23, 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, [[Motherboard (website)|Motherboard]] called the R-Zone, \"Perhaps the most infamous product ever associated with Tiger\", stating that the console's games \"were glorified versions\" of Tiger's LCD games. Motherboard stated that the R-Zone was similar to the Virtual Boy in some ways, but considered the R-Zone to be \"much, much worse\".<ref name=mother>{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Ernie|title=Tiger Electronics Took on the Game Boy with Devices as Powerful as Calculators|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/wnxp5x/tiger-electronics-took-on-the-game-boy-with-devices-as-powerful-as-calculators|accessdate=November 25, 2017|work=Motherboard|date=August 25, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|R-Zone}}\n*[http://www.retrojunk.com/details_commercial/104/ R Zone Head Gear commercial](link goes to commercial on retrojunk.com)\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20180902183816/http://museo8bits.com/ficha.php?nombre=rzone El Museo de los 8 Bits] with a list of games\n*[http://www.miniarcade.com/tiger/rzone.htm miniarcade.com]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09so0ghPYG4 Video Review by YouTube user Ashens]\n*[http://old-organizers.com/MorePicts/MP427.htm Info and pictures of the R Zone DataZone game console and organizer]\n{{Handheld game consoles}}\n\n[[Category:1990s toys]]\n[[Category:Fifth-generation video game consoles]]\n[[Category:Handheld game consoles]]\n[[Category:Products introduced in 1995]]\n", "name_user": "2600:8803:3400:8f9:1cd4:8530:ec2b:e2bd", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-Zone"}
