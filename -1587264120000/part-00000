The conflict killed about 250,000 people<ref>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13729504</ref> and eventually led to the involvement of the [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS) and of the [[United Nations]]. The peace did not last long, and in 1999 the [[Second Liberian Civil War]] broke out.\n\n[[Samuel Doe]] had led a rebellion that overthrew the elected government in 1980, and in [[Liberian general election, 1985|1985 held elections]] that were widely considered fraudulent. There had been one unsuccessful coup by a former military leader. In December 1989, former government minister [[Charles Taylor (Liberia)|Charles Taylor]] moved into the country from neighboring [[Ivory Coast]] to start an uprising meant to topple the Doe government.\n\nTaylor's forces, the [[National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] (NPFL) battled with [[Prince Johnson]]'s rebel group, the [[Independent National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] (INPFL) \u2013 a faction of NPFL \u2013 for control in Monrovia. In 1990, Johnson seized the capital of [[Monrovia]] and executed Doe brutally.\n\nPeace negotiations and foreign involvement led to a ceasefire in 1995 that was broken the next year before a final peace agreement and new national elections were held in 1997. Taylor was elected [[President of Liberia]] in July 1997.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger - Samuel K. Doe.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Samuel Doe]] with then-Secretary of Defense of the United States [[Caspar W. Weinberger]] outside of the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] in 1982.]]\n\n=== Samuel Doe takes power in coup (1980) ===\n[[Samuel Doe]] had taken power in a popular rebellion in 1980 against the Liberian Government, becoming the first Liberian President of non [[Americo-Liberian people|Americo-Liberian]] descent. Doe established a military regime called the [[People's Representative]] and enjoyed Liberian ethnic groups who were denied power since the founding of the country in 1847\n\nAny hope that Doe would improve the way Liberia was run was put aside as he quickly clamped down on opposition, fueled by his paranoia of a counter-coup attempt against him. As promised, Doe held [[Liberian general election, 1985|elections in 1985]] and won the presidency by just enough of a margin to avoid a runoff. However, international monitors condemned this election as fraudulent.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/1985/1025/olib.html|title=Fraud charged in Liberia's first one-man, one-vote election|date=1985-10-25|work=Christian Science Monitor|access-date=2017-10-17|issn=0882-7729}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n=== Coup attempt by Thomas Johnson (November 1985) ===\n[[Thomas Johnson (general)|Thomas Johnson]], the former Commanding General of the Armed Forces of Liberia whom Doe had demoted and forced to flee the country, attempted to overthrow Doe's regime from neighbouring [[Sierra Leone]]. The coup attempt failed and Johnson was killed and allegedly eaten.<ref name=Dickovick>{{cite book |title=The World Today Series: Africa 2012 |last=Dickovick |first=J.

''Daily Star'' 1985-11-18: 5.</ref>\n\n=== Mistreatment of the Gio and Mano ethnic groups (1985) ===\nThe Gio and Mano ethnic groups were persecuted against because they were charged with treason against the state. Thus, they were seen as inferiors to the President's own tribe, the Krahn. The mistreatment of the Gio and Mano increased the tensions in Liberia, which had already been rising due to Doe's preferential treatment of his own group.\n\n=== Charles Taylor builds insurgent forces (1985-1989) ===\n[[Charles Taylor (Liberia)|Charles Taylor]], who had left Doe's government after being accused of embezzlement, assembled a group of rebels in [[C\u00f4te d'Ivoire]] (mostly ethnic Gios and Manos who felt persecuted by Doe) who later became known as the [[National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] (NPFL). They invaded Nimba County on 24 December 1989. The Liberian Army retaliated against the whole population of the region, attacking unarmed civilians and burning villages. Many left as refugees for [[Guinea]] and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, but opposition to Doe was inflamed. [[Prince Johnson]], an NPFL fighter, split to form his own [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] force soon after crossing the border, based on the [[Gio Tribe|Gio tribe]] and named [[Independent National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] (INPFL).\n\n==First Liberian Civil War (1989-1997)==\n\n=== Charles Taylor's force attacks (1989) ===\n[[Charles Taylor (Liberia)|Charles Taylor]] organized and trained indigenous northerners in [[Ivory Coast]]. During Doe's regime Taylor had served in the Liberian Government's General Services Agency, acting  'as its ''de facto'' director'.<ref>Stephen Ellis, ''The Mask of Anarchy'', Hurst & Company, London, 2001, p.57, 67-68</ref> He fled to the United States in 1983 amid what Stephan Ellis describes as the 'increasingly menacing atmosphere in Monrovia' shortly before [[Thomas Quiwonkpa]], Doe's chief lieutenant, fled into exile himself. Doe requested Taylor's extradition for embezzling $900,000 of Liberian government funds. Taylor was thus arrested in the United States and after sixteen months broke out of a Massachusetts jail in circumstances that are still unclear.\n\n=== Krahn vs Gio and Mano ethnic groups ===\nThe NPFL initially encountered plenty of support within Nimba County, which had endured the majority of Samuel Doe's wrath after the 1985 attempted coup. Taylor and his force of 100 rebels reentered Liberia in 1989, on Christmas Eve, thousands of Gio and Mano joined them. Doe responded by sending two AFL battalions, including the 1st Infantry Battalion,<ref>HRW, Flight from Terror, May 1990</ref> to Nimba in December 1989-January 1990,<ref>Charles Hartung, 'Peacekeeping in Liberia: ECOMOG and the Struggle for Order,' Liberian Studies Journal, Volume XXX, No.2, 2005</ref> apparently under then-Colonel Hezekiah Bowen.<ref>Mark Huband, The Liberian Civil War, p.115, 118-119</ref>\n\nThe AFL acted in a very brutal and scorched-earth fashion, which quickly alienated the local people. The rebel invasion soon pitted [[Krahn people|ethnic Krahn]] sympathetic to the Doe regime against those victimized by it, the [[Gio Tribe|Gio]] and the Mano. Thousands of civilians were massacred on both sides. Hundreds of thousands fled their homes. The [[Monrovia Church massacre]] was carried out by approximately 30 ethnic Krahn government soldiers, killing 600 civilians in St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Monrovia, on 29 July 1990, the worst single atrocity of the First Liberian Civil War.<ref name=\"Bbcnews\" >{{cite news |date=12 February 2018|title=Liberian church massacre survivors seek US justice|trans-title=|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-42996851|language= |work=[[BBC News]]|location= |access-date=14 December 2018 }}</ref><ref name=\"Nytimes\" >{{cite news |date=31 July 1990|title=Liberia Troops Accused Of Massacre in Church|trans-title=|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/31/world/liberia-troops-accused-of-massacre-in-church.html|language= |work=[[The New York Times]]|location= |access-date=14 December 2018 }}</ref>\n\nBy May 1990 the AFL had been forced back to [[Gbarnga]], still under the control of Bowen's troops, but they lost the town to a NPFL assault on 28 May.<ref>Hubard, p.115</ref> By June 1990, Taylor's forces were laying siege to Monrovia.  In July 1990, [[Prince Yormie Johnson]] split from Taylor and formed the Independent National Patriotic Front (INPFL). The INPFL and NPFL continued their siege on Monrovia, which the AFL defended. Johnson quickly took control of parts of Monrovia prompting evacuation of foreign nationals and diplomats by the US Navy in August.\n\n=== ECOWAS intervention force (August 1990) ===\nIn August 1990, the 16-member [[ECOWAS|Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)]] agreed to deploy a joint military intervention force, the Economic Community Monitoring Group ([[ECOMOG]]), and place it under Nigerian leadership. The mission later included troops from non-ECOWAS countries, including Uganda and Tanzania. ECOMOG's objectives were to impose a cease-fire; help Liberians establish an interim government until elections could be held; stop the killing of innocent civilians; and ensure the safe evacuation of foreign nationals.\n\nECOMOG also sought to prevent the conflict from spreading into neighboring states, which share a complex history of state, economic, and ethno-linguistic social relations with Liberia. The [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS) attempted to persuade Doe to resign and go into exile, but despite his weak position&nbsp;\u2013 besieged in his mansion&nbsp;\u2013 he refused. [[ECOMOG]], an ECOWAS intervention force, arrived at the Freeport of Monrovia on August 24, 1990, landing from Nigerian and Ghanaian vessels.<ref>Adebajo, 2002, p.75</ref>\n\n=== Capture and killing of Samuel Doe (September 1990) ===\n[[File:Independent National Patriotic Front of Liberia in Monrovia 1990.png|thumb|300px|[[Independent National Patriotic Front of Liberia|INPFL]] militiamen in 1990 after taking control of much of [[Monrovia]].]]\n\nOn 9 September 1990, Doe visited the barely established, newly arrived ECOMOG headquarters in the Free Port of Maher. Stephen Ellis says,<ref>''The Mask of Anarchy'', by Stephen Ellis, 2001, p.1-9</ref> his motive was to lay a complaint that the ECOMOG commander had not paid a courtesy call to Doe, the Head of State, however, the exact circumstances that led to Doe's visit to the Free Port are still unclear. Doe had been under pressure to accept exile outside of Liberia. However, after Doe arrived, a large rebel force led by Prince Johnson's INPFL arrived at the headquarters and then attacked Doe's party. Doe was captured and taken to the INPFL's Caldwell base. He was brutally tortured before being killed and dismembered. His torture and execution was videotaped by his captors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.c-r.org/our-work/accord/liberia/chronology.php#1990 |title=Liberia: Chronology |accessdate=2007-02-26 |last=Armon |first=Jeremy |author2=Andy Carl |year=1996 |work=Conciliation Resources |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308142809/http://www.c-r.org/our-work/accord/liberia/chronology.php#1990 |archive-date=8 March 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=MASK>{{cite book|last=Ellis|first=Stephen|title=The Mask of Anarchy: The Destruction of Liberia and the Religious Dimension of African Civil War|origyear=1999|year=2007|publisher=Hurst & Company|location=London, UK|isbn=1850654174|pages=1\u201316}}</ref>\n\nJohnson's INPFL and Taylor's NPFL continued to struggle for control of Monrovia in the months that followed.  With military discipline absent and bloodshed throughout the capital region, members of ECOWAS created the Economic Community Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) to restore order. The force comprised some 4,000 troops from [[Nigeria]], [[Ghana]], [[Sierra Leone]], the [[Gambia]] and [[Guinea]]. ECOMOG succeeded in bringing Taylor and Johnson to agree to its intervention, but Taylor's forces engaged it in the port area of Monrovia.\n\n=== Peace making attempts (1990) ===\nA series of peacemaking conferences in regional capitals followed. There were meetings in Bamako in November 1990, Lome in January 1991, and Yamoussoukro in June\u2013October 1991. But the first seven peace conferences, including the Yamoussoukro I-IV processes failed. In November 1990, ECOWAS invited the principal Liberian players to meet in [[Banjul]], Gambia to form a government of national unity. The negotiated settlement established the Interim Government of National Unity (IGNU), led by [[Amos Sawyer|Dr. Amos Sawyer]], leader of the LPP. Bishop Ronald Diggs of the Liberian Council of Churches became vice president. However, Taylor's NPFL refused to attend the conference. Within days, hostilities resumed.  ECOMOG was reinforced in order to protect the interim government. Sawyer was able to establish his authority over most of Monrovia, but the rest of Liberia was in the hands of various factions of the NPFL or of local gangs.\n\n===ULIMO===\nThe [[United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy]] (ULIMO) was formed in June 1991 by supporters of the late [[President of Liberia|President]] [[Samuel K. Doe]] and former [[Armed Forces of Liberia]] (AFL) fighters who had taken refuge in [[Guinea]] and [[Sierra Leone]]. It was led by Raleigh Seekie, a deputy [[Minister of Finance]] in the Doe government.\n\nAfter fighting alongside the Sierra Leonean army against the [[Revolutionary United Front]] (RUF), ULIMO forces entered western Liberia in September 1991. The group scored significant gains in areas held by another rebel group&nbsp;\u2013 the [[National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] (NPFL), notably around the diamond mining areas of [[Lofa County|Lofa]] and [[Bomi County|Bomi]] [[Counties of Liberia|counties]].\n\nFrom its outset, ULIMO was beset with internal divisions and the group effectively broke into two separate militias in 1994: [[United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy-Johnson faction|ULIMO-J]], an ethnic [[Krahn]] faction led by General [[Roosevelt Johnson]] and [[United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy-Kromah faction|ULIMO-K]], a [[Mandinka people|Mandingo]]-based faction led by [[Alhaji G.V. Kromah]].\n\nThe group was alleged to have committed serious violations of [[human rights]], both before and after its breakup.\n\n=== Attack on Monrovia (1992) ===\nPeace was still far off as both Taylor and Johnson claimed power.  ECOMOG declared an Interim Government of National Unity (IGNU) with [[Amos Sawyer]] as their president, with the broad support of Johnson.  Taylor launched an assault on Monrovia on October 15, 1992, named 'Operation Octopus.'<ref>See Ellis, Mask of Anarchy, 98-99.</ref> which  may have been led by Burkina Faso soldiers.<ref>Herbert Howe, Ambiguous Order, 2005, 143.</ref> The resulting siege lasted two months.\n\nBy late December, ECOMOG had pushed the NPFL back beyond Monrovia's suburbs.\n\n===UNOMIL===\n{{main article|UNOMIL}}\nIn 1993, ECOWAS brokered a peace agreement in [[Cotonou]], Benin. Following this, on September 22, 1993, the United Nations (U.N.) Security Council established the UN Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL), to support ECOMOG in implementing this peace agreement. UNOMIL was deployed in early 1994 with 368 military observers and associated civilian personnel to monitor implementation of the Cotonou Peace Agreement, prior to elections originally planned for February/March 1994.\n\nRenewed armed hostilities broke out in May 1994 and continued, becoming especially intense in July and August. ECOMOG, and later UNOMIL, members were captured and held hostage by some factions. By mid-1994, the humanitarian situation had become disastrous, with 1.8 million Liberians in need of humanitarian assistance. Conditions continued to deteriorate, but humanitarian agencies were unable to reach many in need due to hostilities and general insecurity.\n\nFactional leaders agreed in September 1994 to the Akosombo Agreement, a supplement to the Cotonou agreement, named after the Ghanaian town where it was signed. The security situation in Liberia remained poor. In October 1994, in the face of ECOMOG funding shortfalls and a lack of will by the Liberian combatants to honor agreements to end the war, the UN Security Council reduced to about 90 the number of UNOMIL observers. It extended UNOMIL's mandate and subsequently extended it several times until September 1997.\n\nIn December 1994, the factions and other parties signed the Accra Agreement, a supplement to the Akosombo Agreement. Disagreements ensued and fighting continued.\n\n===Ceasefire (1995)===\nIn August 1995, the main factions signed an agreement largely brokered by Ghanaian President [[Jerry Rawlings]]. At a conference sponsored by ECOWAS, the United Nations and the United States, the European Union, and the [[Organization of African Unity]], Charles Taylor agreed to a cease-fire.\n\nAt the beginning of September 1995, Liberia's three principal warlords&nbsp;\u2013 Taylor, [[George Boley]] and [[Alhaji Kromah]]&nbsp;\u2013 made theatrical entrances into Monrovia. A ruling council of six members under civilian [[Wilton G. S. Sankawulo]] and with the three factional heads Taylor, Kromah and Boley, took control of the country preparatory to elections that were originally scheduled for 1996.\n\n=== Fighting in Monrovia (1996) ===\n[[File:National Patriotic Liberation Front fighters in Monrovia 1996.png|thumb|300px|[[National Patriotic Front of Liberia|NPFL]] fighters search for [[United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy|ULIMO]] militants in [[Monrovia]].]]\n\nHeavy fighting broke out again in April 1996. This led to the evacuation of most international [[non-governmental organization]]s and the destruction of much of Monrovia.\n\nIn August 1996, these battles were ended by the [[Abuja]] Accord in Nigeria, agreeing to [[disarmament]] and [[demobilization]] by 1997 and [[Liberia elections, 1997|elections]] in July of that year. 3 September 1996, Sankawulo is followed by [[Ruth Perry]] as chairwoman of the ruling council, who served until 2 August 1997.\n\n=== 1997 Elections ===\n{{Main|1997 Liberian general election}}\nSimultaneous elections for the [[Liberia elections, 1997#Presidential election results|presidency]] and [[Liberia elections, 1997#Legislative election results|national assembly]] were finally held in July 1997.\nIn a climate hardly conducive to free movement and security of persons, Taylor and his [[National Patriotic Party]] won an overwhelming victory against 12 other candidates.  Assisted by widespread intimidation, Taylor took 75 per cent of the presidential poll (no other candidate won more than 10 per cent) while the NPP won a similar proportion of seats in both parliamentary chambers. 2 August 1997, Ruth Perry handed power to elected president Charles Taylor.\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{See also|1998 Monrovia clashes}}\n\nIn 1997, the Liberian people elected Charles Taylor as the President after he entered the capital city, [[Monrovia]], by force. Liberians had voted for Taylor in the hope that he would end the bloodshed.  The bloodshed did slow considerably, but it did not end. Violent events flared up regularly after the putative end of the war. Taylor, furthermore, was accused of backing guerrillas in neighboring countries and funneling diamond money into arms purchases for the rebel armies he supported, and into luxuries for himself. The implicit unrest manifested during the late 1990s is emblematic in the sharp national economic decline and the prevalent sale of diamonds and timber in exchange for small arms.\n\nAfter Taylor's victory, Liberia was peaceful enough so that refugees began to return. But other leaders were forced to leave the country, and some ULIMO forces reformed as the [[Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy]] (LURD). LURD began fighting in [[Lofa County]] with the aim of destabilizing the government and gaining control of the local [[diamond]] fields, leading to the [[Second Liberian Civil War]].\n\n===Impact===\nThe Liberian civil war was one of Africa's bloodiest. From 1989-1996, it claimed the lives of more than 200,000 Liberians and further displaced a million others into refugee camps in neighboring countries. [[Child soldier]]s were used throughout the war.\n\nThe civil war claimed the lives of one out of every 17 people in the country, uprooted most of the rest, and destroyed a once-viable economic infrastructure.  The strife also spread to Liberia's neighbors. It helped slow democratization in West Africa at the beginning of the 1990s and destabilized a region that already was one of the world's most unsteady.\n\n==Second Liberian Civil War==\nThe [[Second Liberian Civil War]] began in 1999 and ended in October 2003, when [[ECOWAS]] intervened to stop the [[Siege of Monrovia|rebel siege]] on Monrovia and exiled Charles Taylor to Nigeria until he was arrested in 2006 and taken to [[The Hague]] for his trial. By the conclusion of the final war, more than 250,000 people had been killed and nearly 1 million displaced. Half that number remain to be repatriated in 2005, at the election of Liberia's first democratic President since the initial 1980 ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' of Samuel Doe.\n\nFormer president [[Ellen Johnson Sirleaf]], who initially was a strong supporter of Charles Taylor, was inaugurated in January 2006 and the National Transitional Government of Liberia terminated its power.\n\nCharles Taylor was sentenced to a trial in 2003, after being accused of rape and acts of sexual violence, promoting child soldiers, and an illegal ownership of weapons. He denied these accusations but was eventually testified against by his victims. He was then sentenced to 50 years in prison.\n\n== Lists ==\n\n===Armed groups that participated in the war===\n*[[Armed Forces of Liberia]] (AFL)\n*[[Liberia Peace Council]] (LPC)\n*[[Lofa Defense Force]] (LDF)\n*[[National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] (NPFL)\n**[[Independent National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] (INPFL)\n**[[National Patriotic Front of Liberia-Central Revolutionary Council]] (NPFL-CRC)\n*[[United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy]] (ULIMO)\n**[[United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy-Johnson faction]] (ULIMO-J)\n**[[United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy-Kromah faction]] (ULIMO-K)\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2017}}\n=== Peace agreements ===\nPeace agreements signed included the:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=94&value=#|title=Uppsala Conflict Data Program}}</ref> \n*Banjul III Agreement (1990-10-24)\n*Bamako Ceasefire Agreement (1990-11-28)\n*Banjul IV Agreement (1990-12-21)\n*Lom\u00e9 Agreement (1991-02-13)\n*Yamoussoukro IV Peace Agreement (1991-10-30)\n*Geneva Agreement 1992 (1992-04-07)\n*Cotonou Peace Agreement (1993-07-25)\n*Akosombo Peace Agreement (1994-09-12)\n*Accra Agreements/Akosombo clarification agreement (1994-12-21)\n*Abuja Peace Agreement (1995-08-19)\n\n==See also==\n*[[Second Liberian Civil War]]\n\n'''General:'''\n*[[History of Liberia]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Gerdes, Felix: Civil War and State Formation: The Political Economy of War and Peace in Liberia, Frankfurt/New York: Campus Verlag & University of Chicago Press, 2013\n*Hoffman, Danny. \"The City as Barracks: Freetown, Monrovia, and the Organization of Violence in Postcolonial African Cities.\" Cultural Anthropology.

The conflict killed about 250,000 people<ref>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13729504</ref> and eventually led to the involvement of the [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS) and of the [[United Nations]]. The peace did not last long, and in 1999 the [[Second Liberian Civil War]] broke out.\n\n[[Samuel Doe]] had led a rebellion that overthrew the elected government in 1980, and in [[Liberian general election, 1985|1985 held elections]] that were widely considered fraudulent. There had been one unsuccessful coup by a former military leader. In December 1989, former government minister [[Charles Taylor (Liberia)|Charles Taylor]] moved into the country from neighboring [[Ivory Coast]] to start an uprising meant to topple the Doe government.\n\nTaylor's forces, the [[National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] (NPFL) battled with [[Prince Johnson]]'s rebel group, the [[Independent National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] (INPFL) \u2013 a faction of NPFL \u2013 for control in Monrovia. In 1990, Johnson seized the capital of [[Monrovia]] and executed Doe brutally.\n\nPeace negotiations and foreign involvement led to a ceasefire in 1995 that was broken the next year before a final peace agreement and new national elections were held in 1997. Taylor was elected [[President of Liberia]] in July 1997.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger - Samuel K. Doe.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Samuel Doe]] with then-Secretary of Defense of the United States [[Caspar W. Weinberger]] outside of the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] in 1982.]]\n\n=== Samuel Doe takes power in coup (1980) ===\n[[Samuel Doe]] had taken power in a popular rebellion in 1980 against the Liberian Government, becoming the first Liberian President of non [[Americo-Liberian people|Americo-Liberian]] descent. Doe established a military regime called the [[People's Representative]] and enjoyed Liberian ethnic groups who were denied power since the founding of the country in 1847\n\nAny hope that Doe would improve the way Liberia was run was put aside as he quickly clamped down on opposition, fueled by his paranoia of a counter-coup attempt against him. As promised, Doe held [[Liberian general election, 1985|elections in 1985]] and won the presidency by just enough of a margin to avoid a runoff. However, international monitors condemned this election as fraudulent.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/1985/1025/olib.html|title=Fraud charged in Liberia's first one-man, one-vote election|date=1985-10-25|work=Christian Science Monitor|access-date=2017-10-17|issn=0882-7729}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n=== Coup attempt by Thomas Johnson (November 1985) ===\n[[Thomas Johnson]], the former Commanding General of the Armed Forces of Liberia whom Doe had demoted and forced to flee the country, attempted to overthrow Doe's regime from neighbouring [[Sierra Leone]].

''Daily Star'' 1985-11-18: 5.</ref>\n\n=== Mistreatment of the Gio and Mano ethnic groups (1985) ===\nThe Gio and Mano ethnic groups were persecuted against because they were charged with treason against the state. Thus, they were seen as inferiors to the President's own tribe, the Krahn. The mistreatment of the Gio and Mano increased the tensions in Liberia, which had already been rising due to Doe's preferential treatment of his own group.\n\n=== Charles Taylor builds insurgent forces (1985-1989) ===\n[[Charles Taylor (Liberia)|Charles Taylor]], who had left Doe's government after being accused of embezzlement, assembled a group of rebels in [[C\u00f4te d'Ivoire]] (mostly ethnic Gios and Manos who felt persecuted by Doe) who later became known as the [[National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] (NPFL). They invaded Nimba County on 24 December 1989. The Liberian Army retaliated against the whole population of the region, attacking unarmed civilians and burning villages. Many left as refugees for [[Guinea]] and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, but opposition to Doe was inflamed. [[Prince Johnson]], an NPFL fighter, split to form his own [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] force soon after crossing the border, based on the [[Gio Tribe|Gio tribe]] and named [[Independent National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] (INPFL).\n\n==First Liberian Civil War (1989-1997)==\n\n=== Charles Taylor's force attacks (1989) ===\n[[Charles Taylor (Liberia)|Charles Taylor]] organized and trained indigenous northerners in [[Ivory Coast]]. During Doe's regime Taylor had served in the Liberian Government's General Services Agency, acting  'as its ''de facto'' director'.<ref>Stephen Ellis, ''The Mask of Anarchy'', Hurst & Company, London, 2001, p.57, 67-68</ref> He fled to the United States in 1983 amid what Stephan Ellis describes as the 'increasingly menacing atmosphere in Monrovia' shortly before [[Thomas Quiwonkpa]], Doe's chief lieutenant, fled into exile himself. Doe requested Taylor's extradition for embezzling $900,000 of Liberian government funds. Taylor was thus arrested in the United States and after sixteen months broke out of a Massachusetts jail in circumstances that are still unclear.\n\n=== Krahn vs Gio and Mano ethnic groups ===\nThe NPFL initially encountered plenty of support within Nimba County, which had endured the majority of Samuel Doe's wrath after the 1985 attempted coup. Taylor and his force of 100 rebels reentered Liberia in 1989, on Christmas Eve, thousands of Gio and Mano joined them. Doe responded by sending two AFL battalions, including the 1st Infantry Battalion,<ref>HRW, Flight from Terror, May 1990</ref> to Nimba in December 1989-January 1990,<ref>Charles Hartung, 'Peacekeeping in Liberia: ECOMOG and the Struggle for Order,' Liberian Studies Journal, Volume XXX, No.2, 2005</ref> apparently under then-Colonel Hezekiah Bowen.<ref>Mark Huband, The Liberian Civil War, p.115, 118-119</ref>\n\nThe AFL acted in a very brutal and scorched-earth fashion, which quickly alienated the local people. The rebel invasion soon pitted [[Krahn people|ethnic Krahn]] sympathetic to the Doe regime against those victimized by it, the [[Gio Tribe|Gio]] and the Mano. Thousands of civilians were massacred on both sides. Hundreds of thousands fled their homes. The [[Monrovia Church massacre]] was carried out by approximately 30 ethnic Krahn government soldiers, killing 600 civilians in St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Monrovia, on 29 July 1990, the worst single atrocity of the First Liberian Civil War.<ref name=\"Bbcnews\" >{{cite news |date=12 February 2018|title=Liberian church massacre survivors seek US justice|trans-title=|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-42996851|language= |work=[[BBC News]]|location= |access-date=14 December 2018 }}</ref><ref name=\"Nytimes\" >{{cite news |date=31 July 1990|title=Liberia Troops Accused Of Massacre in Church|trans-title=|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/31/world/liberia-troops-accused-of-massacre-in-church.html|language= |work=[[The New York Times]]|location= |access-date=14 December 2018 }}</ref>\n\nBy May 1990 the AFL had been forced back to [[Gbarnga]], still under the control of Bowen's troops, but they lost the town to a NPFL assault on 28 May.<ref>Hubard, p.115</ref> By June 1990, Taylor's forces were laying siege to Monrovia.  In July 1990, [[Prince Yormie Johnson]] split from Taylor and formed the Independent National Patriotic Front (INPFL). The INPFL and NPFL continued their siege on Monrovia, which the AFL defended. Johnson quickly took control of parts of Monrovia prompting evacuation of foreign nationals and diplomats by the US Navy in August.\n\n=== ECOWAS intervention force (August 1990) ===\nIn August 1990, the 16-member [[ECOWAS|Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)]] agreed to deploy a joint military intervention force, the Economic Community Monitoring Group ([[ECOMOG]]), and place it under Nigerian leadership. The mission later included troops from non-ECOWAS countries, including Uganda and Tanzania. ECOMOG's objectives were to impose a cease-fire; help Liberians establish an interim government until elections could be held; stop the killing of innocent civilians; and ensure the safe evacuation of foreign nationals.\n\nECOMOG also sought to prevent the conflict from spreading into neighboring states, which share a complex history of state, economic, and ethno-linguistic social relations with Liberia. The [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS) attempted to persuade Doe to resign and go into exile, but despite his weak position&nbsp;\u2013 besieged in his mansion&nbsp;\u2013 he refused. [[ECOMOG]], an ECOWAS intervention force, arrived at the Freeport of Monrovia on August 24, 1990, landing from Nigerian and Ghanaian vessels.<ref>Adebajo, 2002, p.75</ref>\n\n=== Capture and killing of Samuel Doe (September 1990) ===\n[[File:Independent National Patriotic Front of Liberia in Monrovia 1990.png|thumb|300px|[[Independent National Patriotic Front of Liberia|INPFL]] militiamen in 1990 after taking control of much of [[Monrovia]].]]\n\nOn 9 September 1990, Doe visited the barely established, newly arrived ECOMOG headquarters in the Free Port of Maher. Stephen Ellis says,<ref>''The Mask of Anarchy'', by Stephen Ellis, 2001, p.1-9</ref> his motive was to lay a complaint that the ECOMOG commander had not paid a courtesy call to Doe, the Head of State, however, the exact circumstances that led to Doe's visit to the Free Port are still unclear. Doe had been under pressure to accept exile outside of Liberia. However, after Doe arrived, a large rebel force led by Prince Johnson's INPFL arrived at the headquarters and then attacked Doe's party. Doe was captured and taken to the INPFL's Caldwell base. He was brutally tortured before being killed and dismembered. His torture and execution was videotaped by his captors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.c-r.org/our-work/accord/liberia/chronology.php#1990 |title=Liberia: Chronology |accessdate=2007-02-26 |last=Armon |first=Jeremy |author2=Andy Carl |year=1996 |work=Conciliation Resources |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308142809/http://www.c-r.org/our-work/accord/liberia/chronology.php#1990 |archive-date=8 March 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=MASK>{{cite book|last=Ellis|first=Stephen|title=The Mask of Anarchy: The Destruction of Liberia and the Religious Dimension of African Civil War|origyear=1999|year=2007|publisher=Hurst & Company|location=London, UK|isbn=1850654174|pages=1\u201316}}</ref>\n\nJohnson's INPFL and Taylor's NPFL continued to struggle for control of Monrovia in the months that followed.  With military discipline absent and bloodshed throughout the capital region, members of ECOWAS created the Economic Community Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) to restore order. The force comprised some 4,000 troops from [[Nigeria]], [[Ghana]], [[Sierra Leone]], the [[Gambia]] and [[Guinea]]. ECOMOG succeeded in bringing Taylor and Johnson to agree to its intervention, but Taylor's forces engaged it in the port area of Monrovia.\n\n=== Peace making attempts (1990) ===\nA series of peacemaking conferences in regional capitals followed. There were meetings in Bamako in November 1990, Lome in January 1991, and Yamoussoukro in June\u2013October 1991. But the first seven peace conferences, including the Yamoussoukro I-IV processes failed. In November 1990, ECOWAS invited the principal Liberian players to meet in [[Banjul]], Gambia to form a government of national unity. The negotiated settlement established the Interim Government of National Unity (IGNU), led by [[Amos Sawyer|Dr. Amos Sawyer]], leader of the LPP. Bishop Ronald Diggs of the Liberian Council of Churches became vice president. However, Taylor's NPFL refused to attend the conference. Within days, hostilities resumed.  ECOMOG was reinforced in order to protect the interim government. Sawyer was able to establish his authority over most of Monrovia, but the rest of Liberia was in the hands of various factions of the NPFL or of local gangs.\n\n===ULIMO===\nThe [[United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy]] (ULIMO) was formed in June 1991 by supporters of the late [[President of Liberia|President]] [[Samuel K. Doe]] and former [[Armed Forces of Liberia]] (AFL) fighters who had taken refuge in [[Guinea]] and [[Sierra Leone]]. It was led by Raleigh Seekie, a deputy [[Minister of Finance]] in the Doe government.\n\nAfter fighting alongside the Sierra Leonean army against the [[Revolutionary United Front]] (RUF), ULIMO forces entered western Liberia in September 1991. The group scored significant gains in areas held by another rebel group&nbsp;\u2013 the [[National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] (NPFL), notably around the diamond mining areas of [[Lofa County|Lofa]] and [[Bomi County|Bomi]] [[Counties of Liberia|counties]].\n\nFrom its outset, ULIMO was beset with internal divisions and the group effectively broke into two separate militias in 1994: [[United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy-Johnson faction|ULIMO-J]], an ethnic [[Krahn]] faction led by General [[Roosevelt Johnson]] and [[United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy-Kromah faction|ULIMO-K]], a [[Mandinka people|Mandingo]]-based faction led by [[Alhaji G.V. Kromah]].\n\nThe group was alleged to have committed serious violations of [[human rights]], both before and after its breakup.\n\n=== Attack on Monrovia (1992) ===\nPeace was still far off as both Taylor and Johnson claimed power.  ECOMOG declared an Interim Government of National Unity (IGNU) with [[Amos Sawyer]] as their president, with the broad support of Johnson.  Taylor launched an assault on Monrovia on October 15, 1992, named 'Operation Octopus.'<ref>See Ellis, Mask of Anarchy, 98-99.</ref> which  may have been led by Burkina Faso soldiers.<ref>Herbert Howe, Ambiguous Order, 2005, 143.</ref> The resulting siege lasted two months.\n\nBy late December, ECOMOG had pushed the NPFL back beyond Monrovia's suburbs.\n\n===UNOMIL===\n{{main article|UNOMIL}}\nIn 1993, ECOWAS brokered a peace agreement in [[Cotonou]], Benin. Following this, on September 22, 1993, the United Nations (U.N.) Security Council established the UN Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL), to support ECOMOG in implementing this peace agreement. UNOMIL was deployed in early 1994 with 368 military observers and associated civilian personnel to monitor implementation of the Cotonou Peace Agreement, prior to elections originally planned for February/March 1994.\n\nRenewed armed hostilities broke out in May 1994 and continued, becoming especially intense in July and August. ECOMOG, and later UNOMIL, members were captured and held hostage by some factions. By mid-1994, the humanitarian situation had become disastrous, with 1.8 million Liberians in need of humanitarian assistance. Conditions continued to deteriorate, but humanitarian agencies were unable to reach many in need due to hostilities and general insecurity.\n\nFactional leaders agreed in September 1994 to the Akosombo Agreement, a supplement to the Cotonou agreement, named after the Ghanaian town where it was signed. The security situation in Liberia remained poor. In October 1994, in the face of ECOMOG funding shortfalls and a lack of will by the Liberian combatants to honor agreements to end the war, the UN Security Council reduced to about 90 the number of UNOMIL observers. It extended UNOMIL's mandate and subsequently extended it several times until September 1997.\n\nIn December 1994, the factions and other parties signed the Accra Agreement, a supplement to the Akosombo Agreement. Disagreements ensued and fighting continued.\n\n===Ceasefire (1995)===\nIn August 1995, the main factions signed an agreement largely brokered by Ghanaian President [[Jerry Rawlings]]. At a conference sponsored by ECOWAS, the United Nations and the United States, the European Union, and the [[Organization of African Unity]], Charles Taylor agreed to a cease-fire.\n\nAt the beginning of September 1995, Liberia's three principal warlords&nbsp;\u2013 Taylor, [[George Boley]] and [[Alhaji Kromah]]&nbsp;\u2013 made theatrical entrances into Monrovia. A ruling council of six members under civilian [[Wilton G. S. Sankawulo]] and with the three factional heads Taylor, Kromah and Boley, took control of the country preparatory to elections that were originally scheduled for 1996.\n\n=== Fighting in Monrovia (1996) ===\n[[File:National Patriotic Liberation Front fighters in Monrovia 1996.png|thumb|300px|[[National Patriotic Front of Liberia|NPFL]] fighters search for [[United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy|ULIMO]] militants in [[Monrovia]].]]\n\nHeavy fighting broke out again in April 1996. This led to the evacuation of most international [[non-governmental organization]]s and the destruction of much of Monrovia.\n\nIn August 1996, these battles were ended by the [[Abuja]] Accord in Nigeria, agreeing to [[disarmament]] and [[demobilization]] by 1997 and [[Liberia elections, 1997|elections]] in July of that year. 3 September 1996, Sankawulo is followed by [[Ruth Perry]] as chairwoman of the ruling council, who served until 2 August 1997.\n\n=== 1997 Elections ===\n{{Main|1997 Liberian general election}}\nSimultaneous elections for the [[Liberia elections, 1997#Presidential election results|presidency]] and [[Liberia elections, 1997#Legislative election results|national assembly]] were finally held in July 1997.\nIn a climate hardly conducive to free movement and security of persons, Taylor and his [[National Patriotic Party]] won an overwhelming victory against 12 other candidates.  Assisted by widespread intimidation, Taylor took 75 per cent of the presidential poll (no other candidate won more than 10 per cent) while the NPP won a similar proportion of seats in both parliamentary chambers. 2 August 1997, Ruth Perry handed power to elected president Charles Taylor.\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{See also|1998 Monrovia clashes}}\n\nIn 1997, the Liberian people elected Charles Taylor as the President after he entered the capital city, [[Monrovia]], by force. Liberians had voted for Taylor in the hope that he would end the bloodshed.  The bloodshed did slow considerably, but it did not end. Violent events flared up regularly after the putative end of the war. Taylor, furthermore, was accused of backing guerrillas in neighboring countries and funneling diamond money into arms purchases for the rebel armies he supported, and into luxuries for himself. The implicit unrest manifested during the late 1990s is emblematic in the sharp national economic decline and the prevalent sale of diamonds and timber in exchange for small arms.\n\nAfter Taylor's victory, Liberia was peaceful enough so that refugees began to return. But other leaders were forced to leave the country, and some ULIMO forces reformed as the [[Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy]] (LURD). LURD began fighting in [[Lofa County]] with the aim of destabilizing the government and gaining control of the local [[diamond]] fields, leading to the [[Second Liberian Civil War]].\n\n===Impact===\nThe Liberian civil war was one of Africa's bloodiest. From 1989-1996, it claimed the lives of more than 200,000 Liberians and further displaced a million others into refugee camps in neighboring countries. [[Child soldier]]s were used throughout the war.\n\nThe civil war claimed the lives of one out of every 17 people in the country, uprooted most of the rest, and destroyed a once-viable economic infrastructure.  The strife also spread to Liberia's neighbors. It helped slow democratization in West Africa at the beginning of the 1990s and destabilized a region that already was one of the world's most unsteady.\n\n==Second Liberian Civil War==\nThe [[Second Liberian Civil War]] began in 1999 and ended in October 2003, when [[ECOWAS]] intervened to stop the [[Siege of Monrovia|rebel siege]] on Monrovia and exiled Charles Taylor to Nigeria until he was arrested in 2006 and taken to [[The Hague]] for his trial. By the conclusion of the final war, more than 250,000 people had been killed and nearly 1 million displaced. Half that number remain to be repatriated in 2005, at the election of Liberia's first democratic President since the initial 1980 ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' of Samuel Doe.\n\nFormer president [[Ellen Johnson Sirleaf]], who initially was a strong supporter of Charles Taylor, was inaugurated in January 2006 and the National Transitional Government of Liberia terminated its power.\n\nCharles Taylor was sentenced to a trial in 2003, after being accused of rape and acts of sexual violence, promoting child soldiers, and an illegal ownership of weapons. He denied these accusations but was eventually testified against by his victims. He was then sentenced to 50 years in prison.\n\n== Lists ==\n\n===Armed groups that participated in the war===\n*[[Armed Forces of Liberia]] (AFL)\n*[[Liberia Peace Council]] (LPC)\n*[[Lofa Defense Force]] (LDF)\n*[[National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] (NPFL)\n**[[Independent National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] (INPFL)\n**[[National Patriotic Front of Liberia-Central Revolutionary Council]] (NPFL-CRC)\n*[[United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy]] (ULIMO)\n**[[United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy-Johnson faction]] (ULIMO-J)\n**[[United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy-Kromah faction]] (ULIMO-K)\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2017}}\n=== Peace agreements ===\nPeace agreements signed included the:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=94&value=#|title=Uppsala Conflict Data Program}}</ref> \n*Banjul III Agreement (1990-10-24)\n*Bamako Ceasefire Agreement (1990-11-28)\n*Banjul IV Agreement (1990-12-21)\n*Lom\u00e9 Agreement (1991-02-13)\n*Yamoussoukro IV Peace Agreement (1991-10-30)\n*Geneva Agreement 1992 (1992-04-07)\n*Cotonou Peace Agreement (1993-07-25)\n*Akosombo Peace Agreement (1994-09-12)\n*Accra Agreements/Akosombo clarification agreement (1994-12-21)\n*Abuja Peace Agreement (1995-08-19)\n\n==See also==\n*[[Second Liberian Civil War]]\n\n'''General:'''\n*[[History of Liberia]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Gerdes, Felix: Civil War and State Formation: The Political Economy of War and Peace in Liberia, Frankfurt/New York: Campus Verlag & University of Chicago Press, 2013\n*Hoffman, Danny. \"The City as Barracks: Freetown, Monrovia, and the Organization of Violence in Postcolonial African Cities.\" Cultural Anthropology.

Nicknamed \"The Hick from French Lick\", Bird is widely regarded as one of the greatest basketball players of all time.\n\n[[NBA Draft|Drafted]] into the NBA by the [[Boston Celtics]] with the sixth overall pick in the [[1978 NBA draft]], Bird started at [[small forward]] and [[Power forward (basketball)|power forward]] for the Celtics for 13 seasons. Bird was a 12-time [[NBA All-Star]] and received the [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award]] three consecutive times ([[1983\u201384 NBA season|1984]]\u2013[[1985\u201386 NBA season|1986]]). He played his entire professional career for Boston, winning three [[NBA championship]]s and two [[NBA Finals MVP]] awards. Bird was also a member of the gold-medal-winning [[1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team]] known as \"The Dream Team\". He was voted to the [[NBA's 50th Anniversary All-Time Team]] in 1996, was inducted into the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]] in 1998, and was inducted into the Hall of Fame again in 2010 as a member of \"The Dream Team\". He was rated the greatest NBA small forward of all time by Fox Sports in 2016.<ref>[https://www.foxsports.com/nba/gallery/top-10-small-forwards-in-nba-history-061814 Fox Sports: Top 10 small forwards in NBA history].  www.foxsports.com, 20 October 2016.

The first regular season game between the Celtics and the Lakers in the 1987\u201388 season proved to be a classic with [[Magic Johnson]] banking in an off balance shot from near the three-point line at the buzzer for a 115\u2013114 Lakers win at [[Boston Garden]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/fc/pgl.cgi?player=birdla01&year=1988|title=Celtics-Lakers Box Score|website=Basketball Reference}}</ref> The historical rift between the teams, which faced each other several times in championship series of the 1960s, fueled fan interest in the rivalry. Not since [[Bill Russell]] squared off against [[Wilt Chamberlain]] had professional basketball enjoyed such a marquee matchup. The apparent contrast between the two players and their respective teams seemed scripted for television: Bird, the introverted small-town hero with the blue-collar work ethic, fit perfectly with the throwback, hard-nosed style of the Celtics, while the stylish, gregarious Johnson ran the Lakers' fast-paced [[Showtime (basketball)|Showtime offense]] amidst the bright lights and celebrities of Los Angeles. A 1980s [[Converse (shoe company)|Converse]] commercial for its \"Weapon\" line of basketball shoes (endorsed by both Bird and Johnson) reflected the perceived dichotomy between the two players. In the commercial, Bird is practicing alone on a rural basketball court (in reality the court was one Bird had had made on the property in French Lick that he had purchased for his mother), when Johnson pulls up in a sleek [[limousine]] and challenges him to a one-on-one match.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nDespite the intensity of their rivalry, Bird and Johnson became friends off the court. Their friendship blossomed when the two players worked together to film the Converse commercial, which depicted them as archenemies. Johnson appeared at Bird's retirement ceremony on February 4, 1993 and emotionally described Bird as a \"friend forever\".{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\n===Late career (1988\u20131992)===\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=March 2019}}\nThe 1987-1988 season was the highest-scoring season of Bird's career. In Game 7 of the 1988 Eastern Conference semifinals against the [[Atlanta Hawks]], Bird shot 9 of 10 from the floor in the fourth quarter, scoring 20 points in that quarter and lifting the Celtics to a series-clinching victory over Atlanta. Bird finished with 34 points. His effort helped to overcome a 47-point performance by Atlanta's [[Dominique Wilkins]]. Wilkins remarked, \"The basket was like a well. I couldn't miss. He couldn't miss. And it went down to the last shot of the game. Who was going to make the last shot? That's the greatest game I've ever played in or seen played.\" The Celtics failed to reach the NBA Finals for the first time in five years, losing to the Pistons in six games during the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nBird's [[1988\u201389 NBA season|1988\u201389 season]] season ended after six games when he had bone spurs surgically removed from both of his heels. He returned to the Celtics in 1989, but debilitating back problems and an aging Celtic roster prevented him from regaining his mid-1980s form. Nonetheless, during the final years of his career, Bird maintained his status as one of the premier players in the game. In his final three seasons with the Celtics, Bird averaged over 20 points, 9 rebounds and 7 assists per game, shot better than 45% from the field, and led the Celtics to playoff appearances.\n\nAfter leading the Celtics to a 29\u20135 start to the [[1990\u201391 NBA season|1990\u201391 season]], Bird missed 22 games due to a compressed nerve root in his back, a condition that would eventually lead to his retirement.

In Game 5 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Pistons, with five seconds remaining in the fourth quarter and Boston trailing the Pistons 107\u2013106, Bird stole an inbound pass. Falling out of bounds, Bird turned and passed the ball to teammate [[Dennis Johnson]], who converted a game-winning 2-point layup with less than a second left. The dramatic play saved the series for the Celtics. When they reached the NBA Finals, the Celtics\u2014hampered by devastating injuries\u2014lost to a dominant Lakers team which had won 65 games during the season. The Celtics ended up losing to the Lakers in six games, with Bird averaging 24.2 points on .445 shooting, 10 rebounds and 5.5 assists per game in the championship series.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_1987_finals.html |title=1987 NBA Finals Composite Box Score|website=Basketball Reference|access-date=December 31, 2015}}</ref> The Celtics would fall short in 1988 losing to the [[1987\u201388 Detroit Pistons season|Detroit Pistons]] in 6 games in the Eastern Conference Finals as the Pistons made up from the heartbreak the previous season. Between them, Bird and Johnson captured eight NBA championships during the 1980s, with Magic getting five and Bird three. During the 1980s, either Boston or Los Angeles appeared in every NBA Finals.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nba.com/history/season-recap-index|title=NBA Season Recaps: 1946-2018 |work=NBA|access-date=November 24, 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the 1980s, contests between the Celtics and the Lakers\u2014both during the regular season and in the Finals\u2014attracted enormous television audiences. The first regular season game between the Celtics and the Lakers in the 1987\u201388 season proved to be a classic with [[Magic Johnson]] banking in an off balance shot from near the three-point line at the buzzer for a 115\u2013114 Lakers win at [[Boston Garden]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/fc/pgl.cgi?player=birdla01&year=1988|title=Celtics-Lakers Box Score|website=Basketball Reference}}</ref> The historical rift between the teams, which faced each other several times in championship series of the 1960s, fueled fan interest in the rivalry. Not since [[Bill Russell]] squared off against [[Wilt Chamberlain]] had professional basketball enjoyed such a marquee matchup. The apparent contrast between the two players and their respective teams seemed scripted for television: Bird, the introverted small-town hero with the blue-collar work ethic, fit perfectly with the throwback, hard-nosed style of the Celtics, while the stylish, gregarious Johnson ran the Lakers' fast-paced [[Showtime (basketball)|Showtime offense]] amidst the bright lights and celebrities of Los Angeles. A 1980s [[Converse (shoe company)|Converse]] commercial for its \"Weapon\" line of basketball shoes (endorsed by both Bird and Johnson) reflected the perceived dichotomy between the two players. In the commercial, Bird is practicing alone on a rural basketball court (in reality the court was one Bird had had made on the property in French Lick that he had purchased for his mother), when Johnson pulls up in a sleek [[limousine]] and challenges him to a one-on-one match.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nDespite the intensity of their rivalry, Bird and Johnson became friends off the court. Their friendship blossomed when the two players worked together to film the Converse commercial, which depicted them as archenemies. Johnson appeared at Bird's retirement ceremony on February 4, 1993 and emotionally described Bird as a \"friend forever\".{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\n===Late career (1988\u20131992)===\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=March 2019}}\nThe 1987-1988 season was the highest-scoring season of Bird's career. In Game 7 of the 1988 Eastern Conference semifinals against the [[Atlanta Hawks]], Bird shot 9 of 10 from the floor in the fourth quarter, scoring 20 points in that quarter and lifting the Celtics to a series-clinching victory over Atlanta. Bird finished with 34 points. His effort helped to overcome a 47-point performance by Atlanta's [[Dominique Wilkins]]. Wilkins remarked, \"The basket was like a well. I couldn't miss. He couldn't miss. And it went down to the last shot of the game. Who was going to make the last shot? That's the greatest game I've ever played in or seen played.\" The Celtics failed to reach the NBA Finals for the first time in five years, losing to the Pistons in six games during the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nBird's [[1988\u201389 NBA season|1988\u201389 season]] season ended after six games when he had bone spurs surgically removed from both of his heels. He returned to the Celtics in 1989, but debilitating back problems and an aging Celtic roster prevented him from regaining his mid-1980s form. Nonetheless, during the final years of his career, Bird maintained his status as one of the premier players in the game. In his final three seasons with the Celtics, Bird averaged over 20 points, 9 rebounds and 7 assists per game, shot better than 45% from the field, and led the Celtics to playoff appearances.\n\nAfter leading the Celtics to a 29\u20135 start to the [[1990\u201391 NBA season|1990\u201391 season]], Bird missed 22 games due to a compressed nerve root in his back, a condition that would eventually lead to his retirement. He had off-season surgery to remove a disc from his back, but his back problems continued and he missed 37 games during the [[1991\u201392 NBA season|1991\u201392 season]]. During the 1992 [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]] semi-finals against the [[1991\u201392 Cleveland Cavaliers season|Cleveland Cavaliers]], Bird missed four of the seven games due to recurring back problems.\n\nOn August 18, 1992, Bird announced his retirement. Following Bird's departure, the Celtics promptly retired his jersey number 33.\n\n==International play==\nIn the summer of 1992, Bird joined [[Magic Johnson]], [[Michael Jordan]] and other NBA stars to play for the United States [[United States men's national basketball team|basketball team]] in that year's [[1992 Summer Olympics|Olympics]] in [[Barcelona]], Spain.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2011/writers/best_team_i_ever_covered/07/10/mccallum.dream.team/index.html |title=Dream Team a star-studded sight to behold for gazers on, off court |work=Sports Illustrated |date=July 20, 2011 |access-date=June 28, 2013 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427135245/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2011/writers/best_team_i_ever_covered/07/10/mccallum.dream.team/index.html |archivedate=April 27, 2014}}</ref> It was the first time in the United States' Olympic history that the country sent professional basketball players to compete.

The show features a [[quiz]] competition in which contestants are presented with [[general knowledge]] clues in the form of answers, and must phrase their responses in the form of questions. The original daytime version debuted on [[NBC]] on March 30, 1964, and aired until January 3, 1975. A weekly nighttime [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] edition aired from September 1974 to September 1975, and a revival, ''The All-New Jeopardy!'', ran on NBC from October 1978 to March 1979. The current version, a daily syndicated show produced by [[Sony Pictures Television]], premiered on September 10, 1984.\n\nBoth NBC versions and the weekly syndicated version were hosted by [[Art Fleming]]. [[Don Pardo]] served as announcer until 1975, and [[John Harlan (announcer)|John Harlan]] announced for the 1978\u20131979 season. Since its inception, the daily syndicated version has featured [[Alex Trebek]] as host and [[Johnny Gilbert]] as announcer.\n\nWith over 8,000 episodes aired,<ref name=\"Jeopardy 8000\">{{cite web|url=https://abc7chicago.com/entertainment/james-holzhauer-reaches-new-jeopardy-winnings-milestone/5315851/|title='Jeopardy!'

The contestants compete in a quiz game comprising three rounds: Jeopardy!, Double Jeopardy!, and Final Jeopardy!{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} The material for the clues covers a wide variety of topics, including history and current events, the sciences, the arts, popular culture, literature, and languages.{{Sfn|Eisenberg|1993}} Category titles often feature puns, wordplay, or shared themes, and the host will regularly remind contestants of topics or place emphasis on category themes before the start of the round.\n\nAll clues in the show are presented as \"answers\", and responses must be phrased in the form of a question.{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} For example, if a contestant were to select \"Presidents for $200\", the resulting clue could be \"This 'Father of Our Country' didn't really chop down a cherry tree\", to which the correct response would be \"Who is/was [[George Washington]]?\" (Contestants are free to phrase the response in the form of any question; the traditional phrasing of \"who is/are\" for people or \"what is/are\" for things or words is almost always used.) When the correct response is the name of a person, the [[surname]] is sufficient except in categories where the host explicitly states the full name is required or the surname is not sufficiently unambiguous. \n\n===First two rounds===\n[[File:Jeopardy game board.png|thumb|255px|left|The layout of the ''Jeopardy!'' game board since November 26, 2001, showing the dollar values used in the first round. Categories at the top of the board vary between each round and episode.]]\n\nThe Jeopardy! and Double Jeopardy! rounds each feature six categories, each of which contains five clues, which are ostensibly valued by difficulty.{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} The dollar values of the clues increased over time. On the original ''Jeopardy!'' series, clue values in the first round ranged from $10 to $50.{{Sfn|Harris|2006|p=13}} On ''The All-New Jeopardy!'', they ranged from $25\u2013$125. In the two pilots that led to the current series, the first kept the $25\u2013$125 values for the Jeopardy! round, while the second doubled these to $50\u2013$250. The current series' first round originally ranged from $100\u2013$500 (doubled again from the second pilot),{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} and was doubled to $200\u2013$1,000 on November 26, 2001.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Show No. 3966 (Harold Skinner vs. Geoffrey Zimmermann vs. Kristin Lawhead)|series=Jeopardy!|network=Syndicated|airdate=November 26, 2001}}</ref>\n\nThe Jeopardy! round begins when the returning champion selects any position on the game board. The underlying clue is revealed and read aloud by the host, after which any contestant may ring-in using a [[lock-out device|hand-held signaling device]]. The first contestant to ring-in successfully is prompted to provide a response to the clue. If the contestant responds correctly, the clue's dollar value is added to the contestant's score, and they may select a new clue from the board. An incorrect response, or a failure to respond within five seconds, deducts the clue's value from the contestant's score and allows the other contestants the opportunity to ring in and respond. If the response is not technically incorrect but otherwise judged to be too vague to be deemed the correct response, the contestant is given additional time to provide a more specific response.{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} Whenever none of the contestants ring in and respond correctly, the host gives the correct response and the \"last correct questioner\" chooses the next clue.<ref name=\"Gameplay rules\">{{Cite book|title=Jeopardy! DVD Home Game System Instruction Booklet|year=2007|publisher=[[MGA Entertainment]]}}</ref>\n\nContestants are encouraged to select the clues in order from lowest to highest value, as the show's writers write the clues in each category to flow from one to the next, as is the case with game shows that ask questions in a linear string. Contestants are not required to do so unless the category requires clues to be taken in order; the \"Forrest Bounce\", a strategy in which contestants randomly pick clues to confuse opponents, has been used successfully by [[Arthur Chu]] and the strategy's namesake [[Chuck Forrest]], despite Trebek noting that the strategy not only annoys him but staffers as well since it also disrupts the rhythm that develops when revealing the clues and increases the potential for error.<ref>{{cite web|first=David|last=Marchese|url=https://www.vulture.com/2018/11/alex-trebek-jeopardy-in-conversation.html|title=In Conversation: Alex Trebek|work=Vulture.com|date=November 12, 2018|accessdate=November 13, 2018|quote=What bothers me is when contestants jump all over the board even after the Daily Doubles have been dealt with. Why are they doing that? They\u2019re doing themselves a disservice. When the show's writers construct categories they do it so that there's a flow in terms of difficulty, and if you jump to the bottom of the category you may get a clue that would be easier to understand if you\u2019d begun at the top of the category and saw how the clues worked.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181113001332/https://www.vulture.com/2018/11/alex-trebek-jeopardy-in-conversation.html|archive-date=November 13, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Another unorthodox strategy is to sweep through the highest values on the board first; if successful, this has several advantages: the player will have more money to wager on Daily Doubles, and other players will have to answer more questions correctly to earn the same amount of money. [[James Holzhauer]], whose April\u2013June 2019 winning streak included the ten highest single-day money totals in the show's history, regularly used this strategy, in conjunction with the Forrest Bounce and aggressive Daily Double wagering.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.today.com/popculture/jeopardy-winner-james-holzhauer-sets-sights-new-record-t152397|title=A Las Vegas pro gambler is rewriting the 'Jeopardy!' record book \u2014 here's how|first=Scott|last=Stump|work=[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]|date=April 18, 2019|accessdate=April 20, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190420122141/https://www.today.com/popculture/jeopardy-winner-james-holzhauer-sets-sights-new-record-t152397|archive-date=April 20, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nFrom the premiere of the original ''Jeopardy!'' until the end of the first season of the current syndicated series, contestants were allowed to ring in as soon as the clue was revealed. Since September 1985, contestants are required to wait until the clue is read before ringing in. To accommodate the rule change, lights were added to the game board (unseen by home viewers) to signify when it is permissible for contestants to signal;{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|pp=59\u201360}} attempting to signal before the light goes on locks the contestant out for half of a second.{{Sfn|Richmond|2004|p=41}} The change was made to allow the home audience to play along with the show more easily and to keep an extremely fast contestant from potentially dominating the game. In pre-1985 episodes, a buzzer would sound when a contestant signaled; according to Trebek, the buzzer was eliminated because it was \"distracting to the viewers\" and sometimes presented a problem when contestants rang in while Trebek was still reading the clue.{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|pp=59\u201360}} Contestants who are visually impaired or blind are given a card with the category names printed in [[Braille]] before each round begins, and an audible tone is played after the clue has been read aloud. The second round, Double Jeopardy!, features six new categories of clues. Clue values are doubled from the Jeopardy! round.{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} The contestant with the least amount of money at the end of the Jeopardy! round makes the first selection in the Double Jeopardy! round;<ref name=\"Gameplay rules\"/> if there is a tie, the tied contestant standing at the leftmost lectern (from the host's perspective) selects first.\n\nA \"Daily Double\" is hidden behind one clue in the Jeopardy! round, and two in Double Jeopardy!{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} The name and inspiration were taken from a [[horse racing]] [[Daily double|term]].{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|pp=2\u20133}} Daily Double clues with a sound or video component are known as \"Audio Daily Doubles\" and \"Video Daily Doubles\" respectively. Before the clue is revealed, the contestant who selects the Daily Double must declare a wager, from a minimum of $5 to a maximum of his/her entire score (known as a \"true Daily Double\") or the highest clue value available in the round, whichever is greater.<ref name=\"Gameplay rules\"/><ref name=\"5-rules\">{{cite web|title=5 Rules Every Jeopardy!

Not answering the Daily Double also deducts the wager. Whether or not the contestant responds correctly, he or she chooses the next clue.<ref name=\"Gameplay rules\"/> Daily Doubles are usually hidden behind higher-valued questions, and almost never on the top row (only eight of the over 11,000 Daily Doubles since November 2001, 0.07%, have been in that location).<ref>{{cite web|title=Where are Daily Doubles located?|work=FiveThirtyEight|url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/roeder-jeopardy-3.png?w=1150|accessdate=May 20, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190424161628/https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/roeder-jeopardy-3.png?w=1150|archive-date=April 24, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nDuring the Jeopardy! round, except in response to the Daily Double clue, contestants are not penalized for forgetting to phrase their response in the form of a question, although the host will remind contestants to watch their phrasing in future responses. In the Double Jeopardy! round and in the Daily Double in the Jeopardy! round, the phrasing rule is followed more strictly, with a response not phrased in the form of a question counting as wrong if it is not re-phrased before the host or judges make a ruling.<ref name=\"5-rules\" />\n\nIf it is determined that a previous response was wrongly ruled to be correct or incorrect during the taping of an episode, the scores are adjusted at the first available opportunity (typically after the Jeopardy!, Double Jeopardy! rounds, the first break, or a Daily Double break). If it occurs after taping of an episode is completed, the affected contestant(s) are invited back to compete on a future show, complying with federal quiz show regulations.{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|p=64}}\n\nContestants who finish Double Jeopardy! with $0 or a negative score are automatically eliminated from the game at that point and awarded the third-place prize.

At the end of the Double Jeopardy! round, the host announces the Final Jeopardy! category and a commercial break follows. During the break, partitions are placed between the contestant lecterns, and each contestant makes a final wager; they may wager any amount of their earnings, but may not wager certain numbers with connotations that are deemed inappropriate ([[69 (sex position)|69]], [[Number of the Beast|666]], and [[Fourteen Words|1488]] are among the forbidden wagers, though [[Triskadekaphobia|13]], [[420 (cannabis culture)|420]], and [[September 11 attacks|911]] are allowed).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/jeopardy-players-cant-wagers-nodding-144821770.html |title='Jeopardy' players aren't allowed to make wagers referencing sex, Nazis, or Satan |access-date=May 1, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190501121047/https://news.yahoo.com/jeopardy-players-cant-wagers-nodding-144821770.html |archive-date=May 1, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Contestants write their wagers using a [[light pen]] on an electronic display on their lectern.{{Sfn|Dutta|1999|p=xxix}} After the break, the Final Jeopardy! clue is revealed and read by the host. The contestants have 30 seconds to write their responses on the electronic display, while the show's iconic [[Jeopardy!#Theme music|\"Think!\" music]] plays in the background. In the event that either the display or the pen malfunctions, contestants can use an [[index card]] and a marker to manually write their response and wager. Visually impaired or blind contestants use a [[Braille]] keyboard to type in a wager and response.\n\nIn the rare occurrences where there is only one contestant remaining, that contestant automatically wins unless (s)he wagers his or her entire score (which has never been attempted in such a situation) and loses. Otherwise, contestants' responses are revealed in order of their pre-Final Jeopardy! scores from lowest to highest. Players who are tied after Double Jeopardy! have their responses revealed from right to left from the viewer's perspective. As soon as the first correct response is revealed the host confirms it to be so, usually including some brief context, otherwise, the host only reveals the correct response with context after all responses are revealed to be incorrect. A correct response adds the amount of the contestant's wager to his/her score, while a miss, failure to respond, insufficiently specific response or failure to phrase the response as a question (even if correct) deducts it.<ref name=\"Gameplay rules\"/> Misspelling is not penalized so long as the spelling does not affect the pronunciation of the word.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://jeremiahstanghini.com/2013/08/05/the-official-final-jeopardy-spelling-rules/ |title=The Official Final Jeopardy Spelling Rules [UPDATED] |date=August 5, 2013 |accessdate=October 31, 2019 |first=Jeremiah |last=Stanghini}}</ref>\n\nThe contestant with the highest score at the end of the round is that day's winner. If there is a tie for second place, consolation prizes are awarded based on the scores going into the Final Jeopardy! round. If all three contestants finish with $0, no one returns as champion for the next show, and based on scores going into the Final Jeopardy! round, the two contestants who were first and second will receive the second-place prize, and the contestant in third will receive the third-place prize.\n\nThe strategy for wagering in Final Jeopardy! has been studied. If the leader's score is more than twice the second place contestant's score, the leader can guarantee victory by making a sufficiently small wager.<ref name=\"gilbert-hatcher\">{{cite journal|last1=Gilbert|first1=George T.|last2=Hatcher|first2=Rhonda L.|title=Wagering in Final Jeopardy!|journal=Mathematics Magazine|date=October 1, 1994|volume=67|issue=4|pages=268|doi=10.2307/2690846|jstor=2690846}}</ref>{{rp|269}} Otherwise, according to ''Jeopardy!''

The show pays for travel for returning champions and players invited back because of errors who must make multiple trips to Los Angeles. If a tournament travels (does not stay in Los Angeles) on the second week, the show pays for travel.{{Sfn|Jennings|2006|p=122}}\n\nDuring Art Fleming's hosting run, all three contestants received their winnings in cash (contestants who finished with a negative score were not required to pay) and parting gifts, usually an encyclopedia set. This was changed at the start of Trebek's hosting run to avoid the problem of contestants who would stop participating in the game, or avoid wagering in Final Jeopardy!, rather than risk losing the money they had already won; this also allowed the show to increase the clue values since only one contestant's score would have to be paid instead of three.{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|p=57}} From 1984 to 2002, non-winning contestants on the Trebek version received vacation packages and merchandise, which were donated by manufacturers as promotional consideration. Since 2004, a presenting sponsor has provided cash prizes to the losing contestants ({{as of|2019}}, [[GEICO]] serves as the presenting sponsor of the consolation prizes, except for the Tournaments, which are sponsored by [[Consumer Cellular]]).{{Sfn|Mogel|2004|p=148}}\n\n===Returning champions===\nThe winner of each episode returns to compete against two new contestants on the next episode.

In all situations with three new contestants (most notably, unseeded tournaments in the first round), the draw will also determine who will take the champion's position and select first to start the game. (The player scoring the highest in the preceding round will be given the chance to select first in the semi-final and finals.)\n\n===Variations for tournament play===\nTournaments generally run for 10 consecutive episodes and feature 15 contestants. The first five episodes, the quarter-finals, feature three new contestants each day. Other than in the Tournament of Champions, the quarter-finals are unseeded and contestants participate in a random draw to determine playing order and lectern positions over the course of the five games. The Tournament of Champions is seeded based on total winnings in regular games to determine playing order and lectern positions, with the top five players occupying the champion's lectern for the quarter-final games.\n\nThe winners of the five quarter-final games and the four highest-scoring non-winners (\"wild cards\"), advance to the semi-finals, which run for three days. The semi-finals are seeded with the quarter-final winners being seeded 1\u20135 based on their quarter-final scores and the wild cards being seeded 6\u20139. The winners of the quarter-final games with the three highest scores occupy the champion's lectern for the semi-finals. The winners of the three semi-final games advance to play in a two-game final match, in which the scores from both games are combined to determine the overall standings. This format has been used since the first Tournament of Champions in 1985 and was devised by Trebek himself.{{Sfn|Eisenberg|1993|p=75}}\n\nTo prevent later contestants from playing to beat the earlier wild card scores instead of playing to win, contestants are \"completely isolated from the studio until it is their time to compete\".{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|p=174}}\n\nIf there is a tie for the final wild-card position, the non-winner that advances will be based on the same regulations as two contestants who tie for second; the tie-breaker is the contestant's score after the Double Jeopardy! round, and if further tied, the score after the Jeopardy! round determines the contestant who advances as the wild card.\n\nIf two or more contestants tie for the highest score (greater than zero) at the end of the match (first round, semi-final game, or end of a two-game final), the standard tiebreaker is used. However, if two or more contestants tie for the highest score at the end of the first game of a two-game final, no tiebreaker is played.\n\nIf none of the contestants in a quarter-final or semi-final game end with a positive score, no contestant automatically qualifies from that game, and an additional wild card contestant advances instead.<ref name=\"Teen Tournament Semifinal\">{{Cite episode|title=Teen Tournament Semi-final Game 2 (Tori Amos vs. Joe Vertnik vs. Kelton Ellis)|series=Jeopardy!|network=Syndicated|date=February 7, 2013}}</ref> This occurred in the quarter-finals of the 1991 Seniors Tournament and the semi-finals of the 2013 Teen Tournament.<ref name=\"Teen Tournament Semifinal\"/>\n\nIn the finals, contestants who finish Double Jeopardy! with a $0 or negative score on either day do not play Final Jeopardy! that day. Their score for that leg is recorded as $0.\n\n==Conception and development==\nIn a 1964 [[Associated Press]] profile released shortly before the original ''Jeopardy!'' series premiered, [[Merv Griffin]] offered the following account of how he created the quiz show:\n{{quote|My wife Julann just came up with the idea one day when we were in a plane bringing us back to [[New York City]] from [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]].

The show features a [[quiz]] competition in which contestants are presented with [[general knowledge]] clues in the form of answers, and must phrase their responses in the form of questions. The original daytime version debuted on [[NBC]] on March 30, 1964, and aired until January 3, 1975. A weekly nighttime [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] edition aired from September 1974 to September 1975, and a revival, ''The All-New Jeopardy!'', ran on NBC from October 1978 to March 1979. The current version, a daily syndicated show produced by [[Sony Pictures Television]], premiered on September 10, 1984.\n\nBoth NBC versions and the weekly syndicated version were hosted by [[Art Fleming]]. [[Don Pardo]] served as announcer until 1975, and [[John Harlan (announcer)|John Harlan]] announced for the 1978\u20131979 season. Since its inception, the daily syndicated version has featured [[Alex Trebek]] as host and [[Johnny Gilbert]] as announcer.\n\nWith over 8,000 episodes aired,<ref name=\"Jeopardy 8000\">{{cite web|url=https://abc7chicago.com/entertainment/james-holzhauer-reaches-new-jeopardy-winnings-milestone/5315851/|title='Jeopardy!'

The contestants compete in a quiz game comprising three rounds: Jeopardy!, Double Jeopardy!, and Final Jeopardy!{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} The material for the clues covers a wide variety of topics, including history and current events, the sciences, the arts, popular culture, literature, and languages.{{Sfn|Eisenberg|1993}} Category titles often feature puns, wordplay, or shared themes, and the host will regularly remind contestants of topics or place emphasis on category themes before the start of the round.\n\nAll clues in the show are presented as \"answers\", and responses must be phrased in the form of a question.{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} For example, if a contestant were to select \"Presidents for $200\", the resulting clue could be \"This 'Father of Our Country' didn't really chop down a cherry tree\", to which the correct response would be \"Who is/was [[George Washington]]?\" (Contestants are free to phrase the response in the form of any question; the traditional phrasing of \"who is/are\" for people or \"what is/are\" for things or words is almost always used.) When the correct response is the name of a person, the [[surname]] is sufficient except in categories where the host explicitly states the full name is required or the surname is not sufficiently unambiguous. \n\n===First two rounds===\n[[File:Jeopardy game board.png|thumb|255px|left|The layout of the ''Jeopardy!'' game board since November 26, 2001, showing the dollar values used in the first round. Categories at the top of the board vary between each round and episode.]]\n\nThe Jeopardy! and Double Jeopardy! rounds each feature six categories, each of which contains five clues, which are ostensibly valued by difficulty.{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} The dollar values of the clues increased over time. On the original ''Jeopardy!'' series, clue values in the first round ranged from $10 to $50.{{Sfn|Harris|2006|p=13}} On ''The All-New Jeopardy!'', they ranged from $25\u2013$125. In the two pilots that led to the current series, the first kept the $25\u2013$125 values for the Jeopardy! round, while the second doubled these to $50\u2013$250. The current series' first round originally ranged from $100\u2013$500 (doubled again from the second pilot),{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} and was doubled to $200\u2013$1,000 on November 26, 2001.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Show No. 3966 (Harold Skinner vs. Geoffrey Zimmermann vs. Kristin Lawhead)|series=Jeopardy!|network=Syndicated|airdate=November 26, 2001}}</ref>\n\nThe Jeopardy! round begins when the returning champion selects any position on the game board. The underlying clue is revealed and read aloud by the host, after which any contestant may ring-in using a [[lock-out device|hand-held signaling device]]. The first contestant to ring-in successfully is prompted to provide a response to the clue. If the contestant responds correctly, the clue's dollar value is added to the contestant's score, and they may select a new clue from the board. An incorrect response, or a failure to respond within five seconds, deducts the clue's value from the contestant's score and allows the other contestants the opportunity to ring in and respond. If the response is not technically incorrect but otherwise judged to be too vague to be deemed the correct response, the contestant is given additional time to provide a more specific response.{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} Whenever none of the contestants ring in and respond correctly, the host gives the correct response and the \"last correct questioner\" chooses the next clue.<ref name=\"Gameplay rules\">{{Cite book|title=Jeopardy! DVD Home Game System Instruction Booklet|year=2007|publisher=[[MGA Entertainment]]}}</ref>\n\nContestants are encouraged to select the clues in order from lowest to highest value, as the show's writers write the clues in each category to flow from one to the next, as is the case with game shows that ask questions in a linear string. Contestants are not required to do so unless the category requires clues to be taken in order; the \"Forrest Bounce\", a strategy in which contestants randomly pick clues to confuse opponents, has been used successfully by [[Arthur Chu]] and the strategy's namesake [[Chuck Forrest]], despite Trebek noting that the strategy not only annoys him but staffers as well since it also disrupts the rhythm that develops when revealing the clues and increases the potential for error.<ref>{{cite web|first=David|last=Marchese|url=https://www.vulture.com/2018/11/alex-trebek-jeopardy-in-conversation.html|title=In Conversation: Alex Trebek|work=Vulture.com|date=November 12, 2018|accessdate=November 13, 2018|quote=What bothers me is when contestants jump all over the board even after the Daily Doubles have been dealt with. Why are they doing that? They\u2019re doing themselves a disservice. When the show's writers construct categories they do it so that there's a flow in terms of difficulty, and if you jump to the bottom of the category you may get a clue that would be easier to understand if you\u2019d begun at the top of the category and saw how the clues worked.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181113001332/https://www.vulture.com/2018/11/alex-trebek-jeopardy-in-conversation.html|archive-date=November 13, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Another unorthodox strategy is to sweep through the highest values on the board first; if successful, this has several advantages: the player will have more money to wager on Daily Doubles, and other players will have to answer more questions correctly to earn the same amount of money. [[James Holzhauer]], whose April\u2013June 2019 winning streak included the ten highest single-day money totals in the show's history, regularly used this strategy, in conjunction with the Forrest Bounce and aggressive Daily Double wagering.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.today.com/popculture/jeopardy-winner-james-holzhauer-sets-sights-new-record-t152397|title=A Las Vegas pro gambler is rewriting the 'Jeopardy!' record book \u2014 here's how|first=Scott|last=Stump|work=[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]|date=April 18, 2019|accessdate=April 20, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190420122141/https://www.today.com/popculture/jeopardy-winner-james-holzhauer-sets-sights-new-record-t152397|archive-date=April 20, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nFrom the premiere of the original ''Jeopardy!'' until the end of the first season of the current syndicated series, contestants were allowed to ring in as soon as the clue was revealed. Since September 1985, contestants are required to wait until the clue is read before ringing in. To accommodate the rule change, lights were added to the game board (unseen by home viewers) to signify when it is permissible for contestants to signal;{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|pp=59\u201360}} attempting to signal before the light goes on locks the contestant out for half of a second.{{Sfn|Richmond|2004|p=41}} The change was made to allow the home audience to play along with the show more easily and to keep an extremely fast contestant from potentially dominating the game. In pre-1985 episodes, a buzzer would sound when a contestant signaled; according to Trebek, the buzzer was eliminated because it was \"distracting to the viewers\" and sometimes presented a problem when contestants rang in while Trebek was still reading the clue.{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|pp=59\u201360}} Contestants who are visually impaired or blind are given a card with the category names printed in [[Braille]] before each round begins, and an audible tone is played after the clue has been read aloud. The second round, Double Jeopardy!, features six new categories of clues. Clue values are doubled from the Jeopardy! round.{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} The contestant with the least amount of money at the end of the Jeopardy! round makes the first selection in the Double Jeopardy! round;<ref name=\"Gameplay rules\"/> if there is a tie, the tied contestant standing at the leftmost lectern (from the host's perspective) selects first.\n\nA \"Daily Double\" is hidden behind one clue in the Jeopardy! round, and two in Double Jeopardy!{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} The name and inspiration were taken from a [[horse racing]] [[Daily double|term]].{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|pp=2\u20133}} Daily Double clues with a sound or video component are known as \"Audio Daily Doubles\" and \"Video Daily Doubles\" respectively. Before the clue is revealed, the contestant who selects the Daily Double must declare a wager, from a minimum of $5 to a maximum of his/her entire score (known as a \"true Daily Double\") or the highest clue value available in the round, whichever is greater.<ref name=\"Gameplay rules\"/><ref name=\"5-rules\">{{cite web|title=5 Rules Every Jeopardy!

Not answering the Daily Double also deducts the wager. Whether or not the contestant responds correctly, he or she chooses the next clue.<ref name=\"Gameplay rules\"/> Daily Doubles are usually hidden behind higher-valued questions, and almost never on the top row (only eight of the over 11,000 Daily Doubles since November 2001, 0.07%, have been in that location).<ref>{{cite web|title=Where are Daily Doubles located?|work=FiveThirtyEight|url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/roeder-jeopardy-3.png?w=1150|accessdate=May 20, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190424161628/https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/roeder-jeopardy-3.png?w=1150|archive-date=April 24, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nDuring the Jeopardy! round, except in response to the Daily Double clue, contestants are not penalized for forgetting to phrase their response in the form of a question, although the host will remind contestants to watch their phrasing in future responses. In the Double Jeopardy! round and in the Daily Double in the Jeopardy! round, the phrasing rule is followed more strictly, with a response not phrased in the form of a question counting as wrong if it is not re-phrased before the host or judges make a ruling.<ref name=\"5-rules\" />\n\nIf it is determined that a previous response was wrongly ruled to be correct or incorrect during the taping of an episode, the scores are adjusted at the first available opportunity (typically after the Jeopardy!, Double Jeopardy! rounds, the first break, or a Daily Double break). If it occurs after taping of an episode is completed, the affected contestant(s) are invited back to compete on a future show, complying with federal quiz show regulations.{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|p=64}}\n\nContestants who finish Double Jeopardy! with $0 or a negative score are automatically eliminated from the game at that point and awarded the third-place prize. On at least one episode hosted by Art Fleming, all three contestants finished Double Jeopardy! with $0 or less, and as a result, no Final Jeopardy! round was played.{{Sfn|Fabe|1979}} This rule is still in place for the Trebek version, although staff has suggested that it is not set in stone and that executive producer [[Harry Friedman]] may decide to display the clue for home viewers' play if such a situation were ever to occur.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jeopardy.com/jbuzz/features/four-rare-jeopardy-scenarios |title=Breaking Down Four Rare ''Jeopardy!''

During the break, partitions are placed between the contestant lecterns, and each contestant makes a final wager; they may wager any amount of their earnings, but may not wager certain numbers with connotations that are deemed inappropriate ([[69 (sex position)|69]], [[Number of the Beast|666]], and [[Fourteen Words|1488]] are among the forbidden wagers, though [[Triskadekaphobia|13]], [[420 (cannabis culture)|420]], and [[September 11 attacks|911]] are allowed).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/jeopardy-players-cant-wagers-nodding-144821770.html |title='Jeopardy' players aren't allowed to make wagers referencing sex, Nazis, or Satan |access-date=May 1, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190501121047/https://news.yahoo.com/jeopardy-players-cant-wagers-nodding-144821770.html |archive-date=May 1, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Contestants write their wagers using a [[light pen]] on an electronic display on their lectern.{{Sfn|Dutta|1999|p=xxix}} After the break, the Final Jeopardy! clue is revealed and read by the host. The contestants have 30 seconds to write their responses on the electronic display, while the show's iconic [[Jeopardy!#Theme music|\"Think!\" music]] plays in the background. In the event that either the display or the pen malfunctions, contestants can use an [[index card]] and a marker to manually write their response and wager. Visually impaired or blind contestants use a [[Braille]] keyboard to type in a wager and response.\n\nIn the rare occurrences where there is only one contestant remaining, that contestant automatically wins unless (s)he wagers his or her entire score (which has never been attempted in such a situation) and loses. Otherwise, contestants' responses are revealed in order of their pre-Final Jeopardy! scores from lowest to highest. Players who are tied after Double Jeopardy! have their responses revealed from right to left from the viewer's perspective. As soon as the first correct response is revealed the host confirms it to be so, usually including some brief context, otherwise, the host only reveals the correct response with context after all responses are revealed to be incorrect. A correct response adds the amount of the contestant's wager to his/her score, while a miss, failure to respond, insufficiently specific response or failure to phrase the response as a question (even if correct) deducts it.<ref name=\"Gameplay rules\"/> Misspelling is not penalized so long as the spelling does not affect the pronunciation of the word.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://jeremiahstanghini.com/2013/08/05/the-official-final-jeopardy-spelling-rules/ |title=The Official Final Jeopardy Spelling Rules [UPDATED] |date=August 5, 2013 |accessdate=October 31, 2019 |first=Jeremiah |last=Stanghini}}</ref>\n\nThe contestant with the highest score at the end of the round is that day's winner. If there is a tie for second place, consolation prizes are awarded based on the scores going into the Final Jeopardy! round. If all three contestants finish with $0, no one returns as champion for the next show, and based on scores going into the Final Jeopardy! round, the two contestants who were first and second will receive the second-place prize, and the contestant in third will receive the third-place prize.\n\nThe strategy for wagering in Final Jeopardy! has been studied. If the leader's score is more than twice the second place contestant's score, the leader can guarantee victory by making a sufficiently small wager.<ref name=\"gilbert-hatcher\">{{cite journal|last1=Gilbert|first1=George T.|last2=Hatcher|first2=Rhonda L.|title=Wagering in Final Jeopardy!|journal=Mathematics Magazine|date=October 1, 1994|volume=67|issue=4|pages=268|doi=10.2307/2690846|jstor=2690846}}</ref>{{rp|269}} Otherwise, according to ''Jeopardy!''

In the case of a tie, all tying top scorers were paid their winnings.{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} Non-winners receive consolation prizes instead of their winnings in the game. Since May 16, 2002, consolation prizes have been $2,000 for the second-place contestant(s) and $1,000 for the third-place contestant.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Show No. 4089 (Ronnie O'Rourke vs. Ben Tritle vs. Allison Owens)|series=Jeopardy!|network=Syndicated|date=May 16, 2002}}</ref> Since the show does not generally provide travel or lodging for contestants, cash consolation prizes offset these costs. The show pays for travel for returning champions and players invited back because of errors who must make multiple trips to Los Angeles. If a tournament travels (does not stay in Los Angeles) on the second week, the show pays for travel.{{Sfn|Jennings|2006|p=122}}\n\nDuring Art Fleming's hosting run, all three contestants received their winnings in cash (contestants who finished with a negative score were not required to pay) and parting gifts, usually an encyclopedia set. This was changed at the start of Trebek's hosting run to avoid the problem of contestants who would stop participating in the game, or avoid wagering in Final Jeopardy!, rather than risk losing the money they had already won; this also allowed the show to increase the clue values since only one contestant's score would have to be paid instead of three.{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|p=57}} From 1984 to 2002, non-winning contestants on the Trebek version received vacation packages and merchandise, which were donated by manufacturers as promotional consideration. Since 2004, a presenting sponsor has provided cash prizes to the losing contestants ({{as of|2019}}, [[GEICO]] serves as the presenting sponsor of the consolation prizes, except for the Tournaments, which are sponsored by [[Consumer Cellular]]).{{Sfn|Mogel|2004|p=148}}\n\n===Returning champions===\nThe winner of each episode returns to compete against two new contestants on the next episode. Originally, a contestant who won five consecutive days retired undefeated and was guaranteed a spot in the Tournament of Champions; the five-day limit was eliminated at the beginning of season 20 on September 8, 2003.<ref>{{Cite press release|title=''Jeopardy!''

In all situations with three new contestants (most notably, unseeded tournaments in the first round), the draw will also determine who will take the champion's position and select first to start the game. (The player scoring the highest in the preceding round will be given the chance to select first in the semi-final and finals.)\n\n===Variations for tournament play===\nTournaments generally run for 10 consecutive episodes and feature 15 contestants. The first five episodes, the quarter-finals, feature three new contestants each day. Other than in the Tournament of Champions, the quarter-finals are unseeded and contestants participate in a random draw to determine playing order and lectern positions over the course of the five games. The Tournament of Champions is seeded based on total winnings in regular games to determine playing order and lectern positions, with the top five players occupying the champion's lectern for the quarter-final games.\n\nThe winners of the five quarter-final games and the four highest-scoring non-winners (\"wild cards\"), advance to the semi-finals, which run for three days. The semi-finals are seeded with the quarter-final winners being seeded 1\u20135 based on their quarter-final scores and the wild cards being seeded 6\u20139. The winners of the quarter-final games with the three highest scores occupy the champion's lectern for the semi-finals. The winners of the three semi-final games advance to play in a two-game final match, in which the scores from both games are combined to determine the overall standings. This format has been used since the first Tournament of Champions in 1985 and was devised by Trebek himself.{{Sfn|Eisenberg|1993|p=75}}\n\nTo prevent later contestants from playing to beat the earlier wild card scores instead of playing to win, contestants are \"completely isolated from the studio until it is their time to compete\".{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|p=174}}\n\nIf there is a tie for the final wild-card position, the non-winner that advances will be based on the same regulations as two contestants who tie for second; the tie-breaker is the contestant's score after the Double Jeopardy! round, and if further tied, the score after the Jeopardy! round determines the contestant who advances as the wild card.\n\nIf two or more contestants tie for the highest score (greater than zero) at the end of the match (first round, semi-final game, or end of a two-game final), the standard tiebreaker is used. However, if two or more contestants tie for the highest score at the end of the first game of a two-game final, no tiebreaker is played.\n\nIf none of the contestants in a quarter-final or semi-final game end with a positive score, no contestant automatically qualifies from that game, and an additional wild card contestant advances instead.<ref name=\"Teen Tournament Semifinal\">{{Cite episode|title=Teen Tournament Semi-final Game 2 (Tori Amos vs. Joe Vertnik vs. Kelton Ellis)|series=Jeopardy!|network=Syndicated|date=February 7, 2013}}</ref> This occurred in the quarter-finals of the 1991 Seniors Tournament and the semi-finals of the 2013 Teen Tournament.<ref name=\"Teen Tournament Semifinal\"/>\n\nIn the finals, contestants who finish Double Jeopardy! with a $0 or negative score on either day do not play Final Jeopardy! that day. Their score for that leg is recorded as $0.\n\n==Conception and development==\nIn a 1964 [[Associated Press]] profile released shortly before the original ''Jeopardy!'' series premiered, [[Merv Griffin]] offered the following account of how he created the quiz show:\n{{quote|My wife Julann just came up with the idea one day when we were in a plane bringing us back to [[New York City]] from [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]]. I was mulling over game show ideas, when she noted that there had not been a successful 'question and answer' game on the air since the [[1950s quiz show scandals|quiz show scandals]]. Why not do a switch, and give the answers to the contestant and let them come up with the question? She fired a couple of answers to me: \"5,280\"{{emdash}}and the question of course was 'How many feet in a mile?'. Another was '79 Wistful Vista'; that was [[Fibber McGee and Molly|Fibber and Mollie McGee's]] address.
