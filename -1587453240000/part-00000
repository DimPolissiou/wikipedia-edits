Produced on a shoestring budget, the film was a surprise hit, beating ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'' at the [[Yau Ma Tei]] cinema where it was first released.

State television channels and major internet sites were prohibited from broadcasting the [[35th Hong Kong Film Awards]] live as the film was nominated for [[Hong Kong Film Award for Best Film|Best Film]], which it eventually won.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film comprises five short stories set in the year 2025.\n\n===''Extras''===\nPrior to an [[International Labour Day]] celebration, government officials concoct a [[false flag]] assassination plot to foment public support for legislation of the [[Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23|National Security Law]]. They hire two petty gangsters to execute the plot: Hairy (Zerisawa Courtney Wu), a middle-aged low-level [[Triad (organized crime)|triad]] member, and Peter (Peter Chan), an immigrant from India. While the two argue over who should fire the gun, the director of the [[Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region|Liaison Office]] decides that the leaders of both the TMD and the Fortune Parties are to get shot with real bullets, so as to instigate greater panic in the territory. Misbelieving they will get paid and flee to India afterwards, both Hairy and Peter attempt the assassination but are killed instantly on scene by the police. Later, the government identifies the perpetrators as terrorists and restates the significance of the upcoming legislation.\n\nDirector Kwok Zune stated that the triad-like behaviour of the officials was inspired by real-world pro-establishment groups in Hong Kong, who were accused of beating and sexually assaulting pro-democratic protesters during the [[2014 Hong Kong protests]].<ref name=scmp1/>\n\n===''Season of the End''===\nWong Ching (herself) and Lau Ho-chi (himself) attempt to preserve objects from homes destroyed by [[bulldozer]]s. The last specimen Lau wants to create is his own body.\n\n===''Dialect''===\nAs the government enacts laws limiting operating areas of non-[[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]]-speaking [[Hong Kong taxi|taxi]] drivers, a Cantonese-speaking driver (Leung Kin-ping) finds himself marginalised as he fails to pass the national Mandarin proficiency test. The driver's wife instructs him to stop using Cantonese with their son, Kongson, so that the boy will do better at his Mandarin [[medium of instruction]] school. A series of vignettes further illustrate the increasing dominance of Mandarin and Leung's struggle adjusting. He is unable to make himself understood by his Mandarin GPS unit and is ridiculed by a passenger for it. Two Mandarin-speaking fares opt to take another cab when they realise he cannot speak the language. One of his passengers, an office lady ([[Catherine Chau]]), is fired from her job for failing to clearly explain something to a client in Mandarin.\n\nThe film alludes to a 2003 real-world proposal by the [[Transport Department]] that failed, as well as a regulation introduced in [[Wuhan]].<ref name=scmp1/> In [[Mainland China]], Mandarin (a.k.a. Putonghua) is promoted as a national language, and legislation such as the [[Guangdong National Language Regulations]] restricts the use of Cantonese and all other varieties of Chinese. The name ''Dialect'' comes from the fact that the Mainland government refers to Cantonese as a [[dialect]] despite the fact that it is [[mutually unintelligible]] with Mandarin.<ref name=cnn1/> The short was directed by Jevons Au Man-kit, a graduate of the [[The Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts|Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts]], who said that the taxi driver's plight was influenced by his own struggles to write scripts in Mandarin in an increasingly Mainland-oriented Hong Kong film sector.<ref name=scmp1/>\n\n===''Self-immolator''===\n[[File:HK British Consulate Justice Drive 1.JPG|thumb|The British Consulate-General, location of the eponymous self-immolation]]\nAu-yeung Kin-fung (Ng Siu-hin), a young hardline supporter for [[Hong Kong independence]], becomes the first to be convicted under the National Security Law and dies during a [[hunger strike]] in prison. An unknown person commits [[self-immolation]] in front of the [[British Consulate-General, Hong Kong|British Consulate-General]] in [[Admiralty, Hong Kong|Admiralty]]. This escalates public concerns about Hong Kong's undecided future beyond 2047. Au-yeung's friend Karen (Tanzela Qoser) is initially feared to be the self-immolator but is later revealed to have been kidnapped by secret police. Au-yeung's allies, led by Marco ([[Neo Yau Hawk-Sau|Neo Yau]]), break into and set fire to the [[Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region|Central Government Liaison Office]] in [[Sai Wan]], while a group of Christians gather and pray outside the British Consulate-General to urge the Britons to uphold the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]] co-signed with the Beijing authorities. The Communist Party labels the demand for independence a diplomatic affair, thereby justifying the deployment of the [[People's Liberation Army]] in the city. The protests in Sai Wan and Admiralty are crushed violently. As a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] reveals, after witnessing Au-yeung being severely beaten by police, an old woman was moved to commit self-immolation outside the British Consulate-General. The film ends on a prolonged shot of her umbrella burning, alluding to the [[Umbrella Movement]].\n\nThe storytelling is intertwined with interviews with commentators analysing ongoing events and providing background information such as Hong Kong's removal from the [[United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories|UN decolonisation list]] in 1972 at China's behest.\n\nDirected by Chow Kwun-wai, ''Self-immolator'' alludes to the common practice of self-immolation in Mainland China as a form of protest, particularly [[List of political self-immolations|among Tibetans]].<ref name=cnn1/> Chow stated that while the plot of this piece may seem extreme, \"In 2004, people would also find it hard to believe that [the police can drag a protester into a dark corner and beat him up]\", alluding to the [[beating of Ken Tsang]] and other incidents of police brutality during the [[2014 Hong Kong protests]].<ref name=scmp1>{{cite news|last1=Yau|first1=Elaine|title=Ten Years: Hong Kong film that beat Star Wars at the box office, and the directors behind it|url=http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/film-tv/article/1895992/ten-years-hong-kong-film-beat-star-wars-box-office-and-directors|work=South China Morning Post|date=29 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n===''Local Egg''===\nSam ([[Liu Kai-chi]]), a grocery store keeper, is told about the closure of the last chicken farm in Hong Kong. He then visits his egg supplier, farm owner Cheung who recalls the government's actions to gradually kill off [[Agriculture and aquaculture in Hong Kong|the industry]] despite the fact that he has been meeting their demands. Sam's store is frequently checked by Youth Guards, members of a [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]]-like uniform group, since his use of \"local eggs\" on his label is on the censor list. He doubts why \"local eggs\" must be relabeled \"Hong Kong eggs\" when they refer to the same thing. Sam finds his son Ming among a squad of Youth Guards [[Egging|throwing eggs]] at a bookstore, but Ming assures his father that he has kept his teaching in mind and has not participated in the vandalism; instead, he often leaks the censor lists and actions to bookstore keepers so that they can remain safe and preserve the books. Relaxed at his son's critical thinking, Sam reminds a bookstore keeper not to get used to such suppressive acts.<ref name=ejinsight1/>\n\n===Epilogue===\n''Ten Years'' ends with a quote from the [[Book of Amos]]: {{cquote|It is an evil time. Seek good, and not evil, that you may live.|source={{Bibleverse|Amos|5:13b-14a|NIV}}}} and \"Already too late\" fading out and replaced by \"Not too late\".\n\n==Production==\nThe independent film was conceived by Ng Ka-leung, a graduate of the [[Hong Kong Polytechnic University]]. Ng said that the idea predated the [[Umbrella Movement]], and was inspired by ongoing political, educational and housing problems. He explained in late 2015:\n\n{{Quote|text=I had the idea for ''Ten Years'' early last year. I had been feeling dejected for years about the lack of future for Hong Kong. The [[Moral and national education|national education controversy]] showed that the next generation are at risk of ideological indoctrination.

It offers a vision of the semi-autonomous territory in the year 2025, with human rights and freedoms gradually diminishing as the [[Government of China|Chinese government]] exerts increasing influence there. Produced on a shoestring budget, the film was a surprise hit, beating ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'' at the [[Yau Ma Tei]] cinema where it was first released. It has since been released on Netflix as of February 2019.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://coconuts.co/hongkong/lifestyle/dystopian-hong-kong-smash-hit-ten-years-now-available-netflix/ |website=Coconuts Hong Kong |accessdate=7 July 2019|title=Dystopian Hong Kong smash hit 'Ten Years' now available on Netflix &#124; Coconuts Hong Kong |date=2019-02-11 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/GoldenSceneHK/photos/a.10151175333701805/10155700164086805/?type=3&theater|title = Golden Scene Co. LTD. - Film}}</ref>\n\nDue to the film's sensitive political themes, mainland Chinese authorities [[Censorship in China|censored]] reports mentioning ''Ten Years'' except in terms of condemnation. State television channels and major internet sites were prohibited from broadcasting the [[35th Hong Kong Film Awards]] live as the film was nominated for [[Hong Kong Film Award for Best Film|Best Film]], which it eventually won.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film comprises five short stories set in the year 2025.\n\n===''Extras''===\nPrior to an [[International Labour Day]] celebration, government officials concoct a [[false flag]] assassination plot to foment public support for legislation of the [[Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23|National Security Law]]. They hire two petty gangsters to execute the plot: Hairy (Zerisawa Courtney Wu), a middle-aged low-level [[Triad (organized crime)|triad]] member, and Peter (Peter Chan), an immigrant from India. While the two argue over who should fire the gun, the director of the [[Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region|Liaison Office]] decides that the leaders of both the TMD and the Fortune Parties are to get shot with real bullets, so as to instigate greater panic in the territory. Misbelieving they will get paid and flee to India afterwards, both Hairy and Peter attempt the assassination but are killed instantly on scene by the police. Later, the government identifies the perpetrators as terrorists and restates the significance of the upcoming legislation.\n\nDirector Kwok Zune stated that the triad-like behaviour of the officials was inspired by real-world pro-establishment groups in Hong Kong, who were accused of beating and sexually assaulting pro-democratic protesters during the [[2014 Hong Kong protests]].<ref name=scmp1/>\n\n===''Season of the End''===\nWong Ching (herself) and Lau Ho-chi (himself) attempt to preserve objects from homes destroyed by [[bulldozer]]s. The last specimen Lau wants to create is his own body.\n\n===''Dialect''===\nAs the government enacts laws limiting operating areas of non-[[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]]-speaking [[Hong Kong taxi|taxi]] drivers, a Cantonese-speaking driver (Leung Kin-ping) finds himself marginalised as he fails to pass the national Mandarin proficiency test. The driver's wife instructs him to stop using Cantonese with their son, Kongson, so that the boy will do better at his Mandarin [[medium of instruction]] school. A series of vignettes further illustrate the increasing dominance of Mandarin and Leung's struggle adjusting. He is unable to make himself understood by his Mandarin GPS unit and is ridiculed by a passenger for it. Two Mandarin-speaking fares opt to take another cab when they realise he cannot speak the language. One of his passengers, an office lady ([[Catherine Chau]]), is fired from her job for failing to clearly explain something to a client in Mandarin.\n\nThe film alludes to a 2003 real-world proposal by the [[Transport Department]] that failed, as well as a regulation introduced in [[Wuhan]].<ref name=scmp1/> In [[Mainland China]], Mandarin (a.k.a. Putonghua) is promoted as a national language, and legislation such as the [[Guangdong National Language Regulations]] restricts the use of Cantonese and all other varieties of Chinese. The name ''Dialect'' comes from the fact that the Mainland government refers to Cantonese as a [[dialect]] despite the fact that it is [[mutually unintelligible]] with Mandarin.<ref name=cnn1/> The short was directed by Jevons Au Man-kit, a graduate of the [[The Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts|Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts]], who said that the taxi driver's plight was influenced by his own struggles to write scripts in Mandarin in an increasingly Mainland-oriented Hong Kong film sector.<ref name=scmp1/>\n\n===''Self-immolator''===\n[[File:HK British Consulate Justice Drive 1.JPG|thumb|The British Consulate-General, location of the eponymous self-immolation]]\nAu-yeung Kin-fung (Ng Siu-hin), a young hardline supporter for [[Hong Kong independence]], becomes the first to be convicted under the National Security Law and dies during a [[hunger strike]] in prison. An unknown person commits [[self-immolation]] in front of the [[British Consulate-General, Hong Kong|British Consulate-General]] in [[Admiralty, Hong Kong|Admiralty]]. This escalates public concerns about Hong Kong's undecided future beyond 2047. Au-yeung's friend Karen (Tanzela Qoser) is initially feared to be the self-immolator but is later revealed to have been kidnapped by secret police. Au-yeung's allies, led by Marco ([[Neo Yau Hawk-Sau|Neo Yau]]), break into and set fire to the [[Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region|Central Government Liaison Office]] in [[Sai Wan]], while a group of Christians gather and pray outside the British Consulate-General to urge the Britons to uphold the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]] co-signed with the Beijing authorities. The Communist Party labels the demand for independence a diplomatic affair, thereby justifying the deployment of the [[People's Liberation Army]] in the city. The protests in Sai Wan and Admiralty are crushed violently. As a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] reveals, after witnessing Au-yeung being severely beaten by police, an old woman was moved to commit self-immolation outside the British Consulate-General. The film ends on a prolonged shot of her umbrella burning, alluding to the [[Umbrella Movement]].\n\nThe storytelling is intertwined with interviews with commentators analysing ongoing events and providing background information such as Hong Kong's removal from the [[United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories|UN decolonisation list]] in 1972 at China's behest.\n\nDirected by Chow Kwun-wai, ''Self-immolator'' alludes to the common practice of self-immolation in Mainland China as a form of protest, particularly [[List of political self-immolations|among Tibetans]].<ref name=cnn1/> Chow stated that while the plot of this piece may seem extreme, \"In 2004, people would also find it hard to believe that [the police can drag a protester into a dark corner and beat him up]\", alluding to the [[beating of Ken Tsang]] and other incidents of police brutality during the [[2014 Hong Kong protests]].<ref name=scmp1>{{cite news|last1=Yau|first1=Elaine|title=Ten Years: Hong Kong film that beat Star Wars at the box office, and the directors behind it|url=http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/film-tv/article/1895992/ten-years-hong-kong-film-beat-star-wars-box-office-and-directors|work=South China Morning Post|date=29 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n===''Local Egg''===\nSam ([[Liu Kai-chi]]), a grocery store keeper, is told about the closure of the last chicken farm in Hong Kong. He then visits his egg supplier, farm owner Cheung who recalls the government's actions to gradually kill off [[Agriculture and aquaculture in Hong Kong|the industry]] despite the fact that he has been meeting their demands. Sam's store is frequently checked by Youth Guards, members of a [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]]-like uniform group, since his use of \"local eggs\" on his label is on the censor list. He doubts why \"local eggs\" must be relabeled \"Hong Kong eggs\" when they refer to the same thing. Sam finds his son Ming among a squad of Youth Guards [[Egging|throwing eggs]] at a bookstore, but Ming assures his father that he has kept his teaching in mind and has not participated in the vandalism; instead, he often leaks the censor lists and actions to bookstore keepers so that they can remain safe and preserve the books. Relaxed at his son's critical thinking, Sam reminds a bookstore keeper not to get used to such suppressive acts.<ref name=ejinsight1/>\n\n===Epilogue===\n''Ten Years'' ends with a quote from the [[Book of Amos]]: {{cquote|It is an evil time. Seek good, and not evil, that you may live.|source={{Bibleverse|Amos|5:13b-14a|NIV}}}} and \"Already too late\" fading out and replaced by \"Not too late\".\n\n==Production==\nThe independent film was conceived by Ng Ka-leung, a graduate of the [[Hong Kong Polytechnic University]]. Ng said that the idea predated the [[Umbrella Movement]], and was inspired by ongoing political, educational and housing problems. He explained in late 2015:\n\n{{Quote|text=I had the idea for ''Ten Years'' early last year. I had been feeling dejected for years about the lack of future for Hong Kong. The [[Moral and national education|national education controversy]] showed that the next generation are at risk of ideological indoctrination.
