However, the extent of its actual independence from the Kingdom of Ani is uncertain: it was always in the possession of the relatives of the rulers of Ani, and, after Ani's capture by the [[Byzantine Empire]] in 1045, the Bagratuni title \"King of Kings\" held by the ruler of Ani was transferred to the ruler of Kars. In 1064, just after the capture of Ani by [[Alp Arslan]] (leader of the [[Seljuk Turks]]), the Armenian king of Kars, Gagik-Abas, paid homage to the victorious Turks so that they would not lay siege to his city. In 1065 Gagik-Abas ceded his kingdom to the Byzantine Empire, but soon after Kars was taken by the Seljuk Turks.<ref name=\"SAE\"/>\n\nThe Seljuks quickly relinquished direct control over Kars and it became a small emirate whose territory corresponded closely to that of Vanand, and which bordered the similarly created but larger Shaddadid emirate centered at Ani. The Kars emirate was a vassal of the [[Saltukids]] in Erzurum, whose forces were effective in opposing [[Kingdom of Georgia|Georgian]] attempts at seizing Kars. Thus, it was only in 1206 that Zakare of the [[Zakarids-Mkhargrzeli]] succeeded in capturing Kars, joining it to their fiefdom of Ani.<ref>{{harvnb|Lordkipanidze|Hewitt|1987|p=135}}.</ref> It was conquered in 1242 by the [[Mongols]]; was regained by Georgian Kingdom during the reign of [[George V of Georgia|George V the Brilliant]] (1314\u20131346), it remained part of the Kingdom before its disintegration, which then passed into the hands of [[Samtskhe-Saatabago|Georgian Atabegs]] belonging to the [[Jaqeli|House of Jaqeli]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} In 1387 the city surrendered to [[Timur]] (Tamerlane) and its fortifications were damaged.

On June 7, 1945, Soviet Foreign Minister [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] told the Turkish ambassador to Moscow [[Selim Sarper]] that the regions should be returned to the [[Soviet Union]], on behalf of the Georgian and Armenian republics.  Turkey found itself in a difficult position: it wanted good relations with the Soviet Union, but at the same time they refused to give up the territories. Turkey itself was in no condition to fight a war with the Soviet Union, which had emerged as a superpower after the second world war. By the autumn of 1945, Soviet troops in the Caucasus were ordered to prepare for a possible invasion of Turkey. Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] objected to these territorial claims, while [[President of the United States|President]] [[Harry Truman]] initially felt that the matter should not concern other parties. With the onset of the [[Cold War]], however, the United States came to see Turkey as a useful ally against Soviet expansion and began to support it financially and militarily. By 1948 the Soviet Union dropped its claims to Kars and the other regions.<ref>Krikorian, Robert O.

Summers are generally brief and warm with cool nights. The average high temperature in August is {{convert|26|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|lk=on|abbr=on}}. Winters are very cold. The average low January temperature is {{convert|-16|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|lk=on|abbr=on}}. However, temperatures can plummet to {{convert|-35|C|1}} during the winter months. It snows a lot in winter, staying for an average of four months in the city. Due to its geographic location of the city in the province, it has a slightly milder climate compared to the surrounding region. Some hills and peaks in the province, especially around the [[Sar\u0131kam\u0131\u015f]] region, are [[subarctic]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Dfc'') due to the higher elevation of the region.

Its walls date back to the [[Bagratuni Dynasty|Bagratuni]] Armenian period (there is surviving masonry on the north side of the castle) but it probably took on its present form during the thirteenth century when Kars was ruled by the [[Zak'arid]] dynasty.\n\nThe walls bear crosses in several places, including a  [[khachkar]] with a building inscription in Armenian on the easternmost tower, so the much repeated statement that Kars castle was built by [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Sultan]] [[Murad III]] during the war with [[Persian Empire|Persia]], at the close of the sixteenth century, is inaccurate. However, Murad probably did reconstruct much of the city walls (they are similar to those that the Ottoman army constructed at [[Ardahan]]). During the eighteenth century at the [[Battle of Kars (1745)]] a crushing defeat was inflicted upon the Ottoman army by the Persian conqueror, Nader Shah, not far from the city of Kars.\n\nBy the nineteenth century the citadel had lost most of its defensive purpose and a series of outer fortresses and defensive works were constructed to encircle Kars &ndash; this new defensive system proved particularly notable during the [[Siege of Kars]] in 1855.\n\n=== Other historical structures ===\n[[File:20110419 Tas Kopru bridge Kars Turkey Panorama.jpg|thumb|left|\"Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc\" (Stone Bridge 1725) over the Kars river.]]\n[[File:Kars Church Of The Apostles 2009.JPG|thumb|right|The Armenian [[Cathedral of Kars|Church of the Apostles]] housed a museum in the 1960s\u201370s and was converted to a mosque in 1993.<ref>{{cite news|title=Buras\u0131 cami oldu, burada ayin olmaz|url=http://www.milliyet.com.tr/d/t.aspx?ID=879898|newspaper=Milliyet|date=2008-06-24|language=Turkish|quote=Vak\u0131flar Genel M\u00fcd\u00fcrl\u00fc\u011f\u00fc, 1993 y\u0131l\u0131nda kiliseyi Diyanet \u0130\u015fleri Ba\u015fkanl\u0131\u011f\u0131'na devretti.

Built in the 930s, it has a [[tetraconch]] plan (a square with four semicircular apses) surmounted by a spherical dome on a cylindrical drum. On the exterior, the drum of contains [[bas-relief]] depictions of twelve figures, usually interpreted as representing the Twelve Apostles. The dome has a conical roof. The church was converted to a mosque in 1579, and then converted into a Russian Orthodox church in the 1880s. The Russian people constructed porches in front of the church's 3 entrances, and an elaborate belltower (now demolished) next to the church. The church was used as a warehouse from the 1930s, and it housed a small museum from 1963 until the late 1970s.

However, the extent of its actual independence from the Kingdom of Ani is uncertain: it was always in the possession of the relatives of the rulers of Ani, and, after Ani's capture by the [[Byzantine Empire]] in 1045, the Bagratuni title \"King of Kings\" held by the ruler of Ani was transferred to the ruler of Kars. In 1064, just after the capture of Ani by [[Alp Arslan]] (leader of the [[Seljuk Turks]]), the Armenian king of Kars, Gagik-Abas, paid homage to the victorious Turks so that they would not lay siege to his city. In 1065 Gagik-Abas ceded his kingdom to the Byzantine Empire, but soon after Kars was taken by the Seljuk Turks.<ref name=\"SAE\"/>\n\nThe Seljuks quickly relinquished direct control over Kars and it became a small emirate whose territory corresponded closely to that of Vanand, and which bordered the similarly created but larger Shaddadid emirate centered at Ani. The Kars emirate was a vassal of the [[Saltukids]] in Erzurum, whose forces were effective in opposing [[Kingdom of Georgia|Georgian]] attempts at seizing Kars. Thus, it was only in 1206 that Zakare of the [[Zakarids-Mkhargrzeli]] succeeded in capturing Kars, joining it to their fiefdom of Ani.<ref>{{harvnb|Lordkipanidze|Hewitt|1987|p=135}}.</ref> It was conquered in 1242 by the [[Mongols]]; was regained by Georgian Kingdom during the reign of [[George V of Georgia|George V the Brilliant]] (1314\u20131346), it remained part of the Kingdom before its disintegration, which then passed into the hands of [[Samtskhe-Saatabago|Georgian Atabegs]] belonging to the [[Jaqeli|House of Jaqeli]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} In 1387 the city surrendered to [[Timur]] (Tamerlane) and its fortifications were damaged.

On June 7, 1945, Soviet Foreign Minister [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] told the Turkish ambassador to Moscow [[Selim Sarper]] that the regions should be returned to the [[Soviet Union]], on behalf of the Georgian and Armenian republics.  Turkey found itself in a difficult position: it wanted good relations with the Soviet Union, but at the same time they refused to give up the territories. Turkey itself was in no condition to fight a war with the Soviet Union, which had emerged as a superpower after the second world war. By the autumn of 1945, Soviet troops in the Caucasus were ordered to prepare for a possible invasion of Turkey. Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] objected to these territorial claims, while [[President of the United States|President]] [[Harry Truman]] initially felt that the matter should not concern other parties. With the onset of the [[Cold War]], however, the United States came to see Turkey as a useful ally against Soviet expansion and began to support it financially and militarily. By 1948 the Soviet Union dropped its claims to Kars and the other regions.<ref>Krikorian, Robert O.

Summers are generally brief and warm with cool nights. The average high temperature in August is {{convert|26|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|lk=on|abbr=on}}. Winters are very cold. The average low January temperature is {{convert|-16|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|lk=on|abbr=on}}. However, temperatures can plummet to {{convert|-35|C|1}} during the winter months. It snows a lot in winter, staying for an average of four months in the city. Due to its geographic location of the city in the province, it has a slightly milder climate compared to the surrounding region. Some hills and peaks in the province, especially around the [[Sar\u0131kam\u0131\u015f]] region, are [[subarctic]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Dfc'') due to the higher elevation of the region.

This line was originally laid when Kars was within the Russian Empire and connected the city to nearby [[Gyumri|Alexandropol]] and [[Tiflis]], with a wartime, narrow-gauge extension running to Erzurum. Turkey's border crossings with Armenia, including the rail link, the [[Kars-Gyumri-Tbilisi railway]], have regrettably been closed since April 1993.

Its walls date back to the [[Bagratuni Dynasty|Bagratuni]] Armenian period (there is surviving masonry on the north side of the castle) but it probably took on its present form during the thirteenth century when Kars was ruled by the [[Zak'arid]] dynasty.\n\nThe walls bear crosses in several places, including a  [[khachkar]] with a building inscription in Armenian on the easternmost tower, so the much repeated statement that Kars castle was built by [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Sultan]] [[Murad III]] during the war with [[Persian Empire|Persia]], at the close of the sixteenth century, is inaccurate. However, Murad probably did reconstruct much of the city walls (they are similar to those that the Ottoman army constructed at [[Ardahan]]). During the eighteenth century at the [[Battle of Kars (1745)]] a crushing defeat was inflicted upon the Ottoman army by the Persian conqueror, Nader Shah, not far from the city of Kars.\n\nBy the nineteenth century the citadel had lost most of its defensive purpose and a series of outer fortresses and defensive works were constructed to encircle Kars &ndash; this new defensive system proved particularly notable during the [[Siege of Kars]] in 1855.\n\n=== Other historical structures ===\n[[File:20110419 Tas Kopru bridge Kars Turkey Panorama.jpg|thumb|left|\"Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc\" (Stone Bridge 1725) over the Kars river.]]\n[[File:Kars Church Of The Apostles 2009.JPG|thumb|right|The Armenian [[Cathedral of Kars|Church of the Apostles]] housed a museum in the 1960s\u201370s and was converted to a mosque in 1993.<ref>{{cite news|title=Buras\u0131 cami oldu, burada ayin olmaz|url=http://www.milliyet.com.tr/d/t.aspx?ID=879898|newspaper=Milliyet|date=2008-06-24|language=Turkish|quote=Vak\u0131flar Genel M\u00fcd\u00fcrl\u00fc\u011f\u00fc, 1993 y\u0131l\u0131nda kiliseyi Diyanet \u0130\u015fleri Ba\u015fkanl\u0131\u011f\u0131'na devretti.

Built in the 930s, it has a [[tetraconch]] plan (a square with four semicircular apses) surmounted by a spherical dome on a cylindrical drum. On the exterior, the drum of contains [[bas-relief]] depictions of twelve figures, usually interpreted as representing the Twelve Apostles. The dome has a conical roof. The church was converted to a mosque in 1579, and then converted into a Russian Orthodox church in the 1880s. The Russian people constructed porches in front of the church's 3 entrances, and an elaborate belltower (now demolished) next to the church. The church was used as a warehouse from the 1930s, and it housed a small museum from 1963 until the late 1970s. Then the building was left to itself for about two decades, until it was converted into a mosque in 1993. In the same district of Kars are two other ruined Armenian churches. A Russian church from the 1900s was converted to a mosque in the 1980s after serving as a school gymnasium.<ref>\"[http://www.virtualani.org/karscathedral/index.htm THE CATHEDRAL OF KARS: Holy Apostles Church (Surb Arak'elots)].\" VirtualANI.

Throughout [[history of Christianity|its long history]], the [[Christian Church|Church]] has been a major source of social services like schooling and medical care; inspiration for [[Western art|art]], [[Western culture|culture]] and [[Western philosophy|philosophy]]; and influential player in politics and religion. In various ways it has sought to affect Western attitudes to [[vice]] and [[virtue]] in diverse fields. Festivals like [[Easter]] and [[Christmas]] are marked as public holidays; the [[Gregorian Calendar]] has been adopted internationally as the [[civil calendar]]; and the calendar itself is measured from the date of [[Jesus]]'s birth.\n\nThe cultural influence of the Church has been vast.

The teachings of Jesus, such as the [[Parable of the Good Samaritan]], are among the important sources for modern notions of Human Rights and the welfare measures commonly provided by governments in the West. Long held Christian teachings on sexuality and marriage and family life have also been both influential and, in recent times, controversial.

The church forbade its members to do so.  Greco-Roman society saw no value in an unmarried woman, and therefore it was illegal for a widow to go more than two years without remarrying. Christianity did not force widows to marry and supported them financially. Pagan widows lost all control of their husband's estate when they remarried, but the church allowed widows to maintain their husband's estate.  Christians did not believe in cohabitation. If a Christian man wanted to live with a woman, the church required marriage, and this gave women legal rights and far greater security.  Finally, the pagan double standard of allowing married men to have extramarital sex and mistresses was forbidden. Jesus' teachings on divorce and Paul's advocacy of monogamy began the process of elevating the status of women so that Christian women tended to enjoy greater security and equality than did women in surrounding cultures.<ref name=\"Tim Keller\">{{cite book| last=Keller| first=Tim| title=The Reason for God Belief in an age of skepticism| year=2008| publisher=Penguin Books| location=New York| isbn=978-0-52595-049-3| page=[https://archive.org/details/reasonforgodbeli00kell_0/page/249 249]| url=https://archive.org/details/reasonforgodbeli00kell_0/page/249}}</ref>\n\n====Children====\nIn the ancient world infanticide was not legal but was rarely prosecuted.  A broad distinction was popularly made between infanticide and infant exposure which was practiced on a gigantic scale with impunity. Many exposed children died, but many were taken by speculators who raised them to be slaves or prostitutes. <!-- Is this appropriate here? --> It is not possible to ascertain, with any degree of accuracy, what diminution of infanticide resulted from legal efforts against it in the Roman empire.  \"It may, however, be safely asserted that the publicity of the trade in exposed children became impossible under the influence of Christianity, and that the sense of the seriousness of the crime was very considerably increased.\"<ref name=\"W. E. H. Lecky\"/>{{rp|31,32}}\n\n====Constantine====\n[[Emperor Constantine]]'s [[Edict of Milan]] in 313 AD ended the state sponsored persecution of Christians in the East and his own conversion to Christianity was a significant turning point in history.<ref>Religion in the Roman Empire, Wiley-Blackwell, by James B. Rives, page 196</ref> In 312, Constantine offered civic toleration to Christians, and through his reign instigated laws and policies in keeping with Christian principles \u2013 making Sunday the Sabbath \"day of rest\" for Roman society (though initially this was only for urban dwellers) and embarking on a church building program. In AD 325, Constantine conferred the [[First Council of Nicaea]] to gain consensus and unity within Christianity, with a view to establishing it as the religion of the Empire. The population and wealth of the Roman Empire had been shifting east, and around the year 330, Constantine established the city of [[Constantinople]] as a new imperial city which would be the capital of the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]]. The Eastern Patriarch in Constantinople now came to rival the Pope in Rome and Rome itself was [[Sack of Rome (410)|sacked by the Visigoths]] in 410 and the [[Sack of Rome (455)|Vandals in 455]]. Although cultural continuity and interchange would continue between these Eastern and Western Roman Empires, the [[history of Christianity]] and Western culture took divergent routes, with a final [[East\u2013West Schism|Great Schism]] separating [[Roman Catholicism|Roman]] and [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern]] Christianity in 1054 AD.\n\n[[File:Anthonis van Dyck 005.jpg|thumb|upright|''Saint Ambrose and Emperor Theodosius'', [[Anthony van Dyck]].]]\n[[File:Gregorythegreat.jpg|thumb|upright|Pope [[Gregory the Great]] (''c'' 540\u2013604) who established medieval themes in the Church, in a painting by [[Carlo Saraceni]], c. 1610, Rome.]]\n\nThe remarkable transformation of Christianity from peripheral sect, to major force within the Empire is illustrated by the influence held by [[St Ambrose]], the [[Bishop of Milan]]. A [[Doctor of the Church]] and one of the most influential ecclesiastical figures of the 4th century, Ambrose became a player in Imperial politics, courted for his influence by competing contenders for the Imperial throne. When the Emperor [[Theodosius I]] ordered the [[Massacre of Thessaloniki|punitive massacre of thousands of the citizens]] of [[Thessaloniki]], Ambrose admonished him publicly, refused him the Eucharist and called on him to perform a public penance, a call to which the Christian Emperor submitted.<ref>[[Wikisource:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/St. Ambrose]]</ref><ref name=\"Randall D.

In 391 Theodosius sought to block the restoration of the pagan [[Altar of Victory]] to the Roman Senate and then fought against [[Eugenius]], who courted pagan support for his own bid for the imperial throne. Thus, the ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' lauds Theodosius as:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14577d.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Theodosius I|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|[O]ne of the sovereigns by universal consent called Great.

A trained Roman lawyer and administrator, and a monk, he represents the shift from the classical to the medieval outlook and was a father of many of the structures of the later Roman Catholic Church. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, he looked upon Church and State as co-operating to form a united whole, which acted in two distinct spheres, ecclesiastical and secular, but by the time of his death, the papacy was the great power in Italy:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06780a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: St. Gregory the Great|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|[ [[Pope Gregory the Great]] ] made himself in Italy a power stronger than emperor or exarch, and established a political influence which dominated the peninsula for centuries.

Pope's were powerful enough to challenge the authority of kings. The [[Investiture Controversy]] was perhaps the most significant conflict between [[Church and state in medieval Europe]]. A series of Popes challenged the authority of monarchies over control of appointments, or [[investiture]]s, of church officials. The Court of [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], based in Sicily, saw tension and rivalry with the Papacy over control of Northern Italy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06255a.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Frederick Ii |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1 September 1909 |accessdate=16 July 2011}}</ref> The [[Avignon Papacy|Papacy had its court at Avignon]] from 1305\u201378<ref name=Morris>Morris, Colin, ''The papal monarchy: the Western church from 1050 to 1250 '', (Oxford University Press, 2001), 271.</ref> This arose from the conflict between the Italian Papacy and the French crown.\n\n\"The Popes in the fourteenth to the mid-fifteenth century turned their interest to the arts and humanities rather than to pressing moral and spiritual issues.

[[Martin Luther]] separated the religious and the worldly realms in principle ([[doctrine of the two kingdoms]]).<ref>Heinrich Bornkamm, ''Toleranz. In der Geschichte des Christentums'' in ''Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart'', 3. Auflage, Band VI (1962), col. 937</ref> The believers were obliged to use reason to govern the worldly sphere in an orderly and peaceful way. Luther's doctrine of the [[priesthood of all believers]] upgraded the role of laymen in the church considerably. The members of a congregation had the right to elect a minister and, if necessary, to vote for his dismissal (Treatise ''On the right and authority of a Christian assembly or congregation to judge all doctrines and to call, install and dismiss teachers, as testified in Scripture''; 1523).<ref>Original German title: ''Dass eine christliche Versammlung oder Gemeine Recht und Macht habe, alle Lehre zu beurteilen und Lehrer zu berufen, ein- und abzusetzen: Grund und Ursach aus der Schrift''</ref> Calvin strengthened this basically democratic approach by including elected laymen ([[church elder]]s, [[presbyter]]s) in his representative church government.<ref>Clifton E. Olmstead, ''History of Religion in the United States'', pp. 4\u201310</ref> The [[Huguenots]] added regional [[synod]]s and a national synod, whose members were elected by the congregations, to Calvin's system of church self-government. This system was taken over by the other Reformed churches.<ref>Karl Heussi, ''Kompendium der Kirchengeschichte'', 11. Auflage, p. 325</ref>\n\nPolitically, [[John Calvin]] favoured a mixture of aristocracy and democracy. He appreciated the advantages of democracy: \"It is an invaluable gift, if God allows a people to freely elect its own authorities and overlords.\"<ref>Quoted in Jan Weerda, ''Calvin'', in ''Evangelisches Soziallexikon'', 3. Auflage (1958), Stuttgart (Germany), col. 210</ref> Calvin also thought that earthly rulers lose their divine right and must be put down when they rise up against God. To further protect the rights of ordinary people, Calvin suggested separating political powers in a system of checks and balances ([[separation of powers]]). 16th-century Calvinists and Lutherans developed a theory of resistance called the [[Lesser magistrate|doctrine of the lesser magistrate]] which was later employed in the U.S. Declaration of Independence. Thus early Protestants resisted political [[Absolute monarchy|absolutism]] and paved the way for the rise of modern democracy.<ref>Clifton E. Olmstead, ''History of Religion in the United States'', p. 10</ref> Besides England, the Netherlands were, under Calvinist leadership, the freest country in Europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. It granted asylum to philosophers like [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]], [[Baruch Spinoza]] and [[Pierre Bayle]]. [[Hugo Grotius]] was able to teach his natural-law theory and a relatively liberal interpretation of the Bible.<ref>Karl Heussi, ''Kompendium der Kirchengeschichte'', S. 396\u2013397</ref>\n\nConsistent with Calvin's political ideas, Protestants created both the English and the American democracies. In 17th-century England, the most important persons and events in this process were the [[English Civil War]], [[Oliver Cromwell]], [[John Milton]], [[John Locke]], the [[Glorious Revolution]], the [[English Bill of Rights]], and the [[Act of Settlement 1701|Act of Settlement]].<ref>Cf.

By the end of the Medieval period, enslavement of Christians had been mitigated somewhat with the spread of [[serfdom]] within Europe, though outright slavery existed in European colonies in other parts of the world. Several popes issued papal bulls condemning mistreatment of enslaved Native Americans; these were largely ignored.

The ancient texts of the Bible have deeply influenced Western art, literature and culture. For centuries following the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, small monastic communities were practically the only outposts of literacy in Western Europe. In time, the Cathedral schools developed into Europe's earliest universities and the church has established thousands of primary, secondary and tertiary institutions throughout the world in the centuries since. The Church and clergymen have also sought at different times to censor texts and scholars. Thus different schools of opinion exist as to the role and influence of the Church in relation to western letters and learning.\n\nOne view, first propounded by [[The Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment philosophers]], asserts that the Church's doctrines are entirely superstitious and have hindered the progress of civilization. [[Communist states]] have made similar arguments in their education in order to inculcate a negative view of Catholicism (and religion in general) in their citizens. The most famous incidents cited by such critics are the Church's condemnations of the teachings of [[Copernicus]], [[Galileo Galilei]] and [[Johannes Kepler]].\n[[File:Active Christians in Science.jpg|thumb|200px|Set of pictures for a number of notable scientists self-identified as Christians: [[Isaac Newton]], [[Robert Boyle]], [[Francis Bacon]] and [[Johannes Kepler]].]]\nIn opposition to this view, some historians of science, including non-Catholics such as [[J.L.

Nevertheless, the most famous case of a scientist being tried for heresy arose in this field of science: the [[trial of Galileo]].\n\nThe Church's interest in astronomy began with purely practical concerns, when in the 16th century Pope Gregory XIII required astronomers to correct for the fact that the [[Julian calendar]] had fallen out of sync with the sky. Since the [[Spring equinox (Northern Hemisphere)|Spring equinox]] was tied to the celebration of Easter, the Church considered that this steady movement in the date of the equinox was undesirable. The resulting [[Gregorian calendar]] is the internationally accepted [[civil calendar]] used throughout the world today and is an important contribution of the Catholic Church to Western Civilisation.<ref>[http://www.usno.navy.mil/USNO/astronomical-applications/astronomical-information-center/calendars Introduction to Calendars].

Yet the church establishment at that time held to theories devised in pre-Christian Greece by [[Ptolemy]] and [[Aristotle]], which said that the sky revolved around the earth. When Galileo began to assert that the earth in fact revolved around the sun, he therefore found himself challenging the Church establishment at a time where the Church hierarchy also held temporal power and was engaged in the ongoing political challenge of the rise of Protestantism. After discussions with [[Pope Urban VIII]] (a man who had written admiringly of Galileo before taking papal office), Galileo believed he could avoid censure by presenting his arguments in dialogue form \u2013 but the Pope took offence when he discovered that some of his own words were being spoken by a character in the book who was a simpleton and Galileo was called for a trial before the Inquisition.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">[[Jacob Bronowski]]; ''The Ascent of Man''; Angus & Robertson, 1973 {{ISBN|0-563-17064-6}}</ref>\n\nIn this most famous example cited by critics of the Catholic Church's \"posture towards science\", [[Galileo Galilei]] [[Galileo affair|was denounced]] in 1633 for his work on the [[heliocentric]] model of the solar system, previously proposed by the Polish clergyman and intellectual Nicolaus Copernicus. Copernicus's work had been [[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium#Reception|suppressed de facto]] by the Church, but Catholic authorities were generally tolerant of discussion of the hypothesis as long as it was portrayed only as a useful mathematical fiction, and not descriptive of reality. Galileo, by contrast, argued from his unprecedented observations of the solar system that the heliocentric system was not merely an abstract model for calculating planetary motions, but actually corresponded to physical reality \u2013 that is, he insisted the planets really do orbit the Sun. After years of telescopic observation, consultations with the Popes, and verbal and written discussions with astronomers and clerics, a trial was convened by the [[Roman Inquisition|Tribunal of the Roman and Universal Inquisition]]. Galileo was found \"vehemently suspect of heresy\" (not \"guilty of heresy,\" as is frequently misreported), placed under [[house arrest]], and all of his works, including any future writings, were banned.<ref>{{anchor|_note-publication-ban}}[[#Reference-Drake-1978|Drake (1978, p.367)]], [[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|Sharratt (1994, p.184)]], [[#Reference-Favaro-1890|Favaro]] [http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=16&VOLPAG=209 (1905, 16:209,] [http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=16&VOLPAG=230 230)]{{in lang|it}}.

For about 100 years, there was no authoritative pronouncement on the subject, though many hostile comments were made by local church figures. In contrast with many Protestant objections, Catholic issues with evolutionary theory have had little to do with maintaining the literalism of the account in the [[Book of Genesis]], and have always been concerned with the question of how man came to have a soul. Modern [[Creationism]] has had little Catholic support. In the 1950s, the Church's position was one of neutrality; by the late 20th century its position evolved to one of general acceptance in recent years. However, the church insists that the human soul was immediately infused by God, and the reality of a single ancestor (commonly called [[monogenism]]) for the human race.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}\n\n{{As of|2008|alt=Today}}, the Church's official position is a fairly non-specific example of ''[[theistic evolution]]'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.catholic.com/library/adam_eve_and_evolution.asp |title=Adam, Eve, and Evolution |accessdate=10 October 2007 |author=Catholic Answers (Imprimatur Robert H.

Much criticism of this position has been on the grounds that the doctrine hinders scientific research; even some conservatives, taking a [[utilitarian]] position, [[Stem cell controversy#Viewpoints|have pointed out]] that most embryos from which stem cells are harvested are \"leftover\" from [[in vitro fertilization]], and would soon be discarded whether used for such research or not.  The Church, by contrast, has consistently upheld its ideal of the dignity of each individual human life, and argues that it is as wrong to destroy an embryo as it would be to kill an adult human being; and that therefore advances in medicine can and must come without the destruction of human embryos, for example by using adult or umbilical stem cells in place of embryonic stem cells.\n\n== Art, architecture, literature, and music ==\n{{Main|Art in Roman Catholicism|List of Roman Catholic Church musicians}}\n[[File:God2-Sistine Chapel.png|thumb|300px|''The [[Creation of Adam]]'' by [[Michelangelo]] from the ceiling of the [[Sistine Chapel]].]]\n[[File:Benozzo Gozzoli 004a.jpg|thumb|upright|200px|[[Saint Thomas Aquinas]] was one of the great scholars of the Medieval period.]]\n[[File:G.

From 1100, he wrote, monumental abbeys and cathedrals were constructed and decorated with sculptures, hangings, mosaics and works belonging one of the greatest epochs of art and providing stark contrast to the monotonous and cramped conditions of ordinary living during the period. [[Abbot Suger]] of the [[Basilica of St Denis|Abbey of St. Denis]] is considered an influential early patron of Gothic architecture and believed that love of beauty brought people closer to God: \"The dull mind rises to truth through that which is material\". Clarke calls this \"the intellectual background of all the sublime works of art of the next century and in fact has remained the basis of our belief of the value of art until today\".<ref name=\"Civilisation, BBC 1969\"/>\n\nLater, during [[The Renaissance]] and [[Counter-Reformation]], Catholic artists produced many of the unsurpassed masterpieces of [[Western art]] \u2013 often inspired by Biblical themes: from Michelangelo's ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]'' and ''[[Piet\u00e0]]'' sculptures, to Da Vinci's ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo da Vinci)|Last Supper]]'' and Raphael's various ''Madonna'' paintings. Referring to a \"great outburst of creative energy such as took place in Rome between 1620 and 1660\", Kenneth Clarke wrote:<ref name=\"Civilisation, BBC 1969\"/>\n\n<blockquote>[W]ith a single exception, the great artists of the time were all sincere, conforming Christians. [[Guercino]] spent much of his mornings in prayer; [[Bernini]] frequently went into retreats and practised the [[Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola|Spiritual Exercises]] of [[Ignatius of Loyola|Saint Ignatius]]; [[Rubens]] attended Mass every morning before beginning work. The exception was [[Caravaggio]], who was like the hero of a modern play, except that he happened to paint very well.\n\nThis conformism was not based on fear of the Inquisition, but on the perfectly simple belief that the faith which had inspired the great saints of the preceding generation was something by which a man should regulate his life.</blockquote>\n\nIn music, Catholic monks developed the first forms of modern Western musical notation in order to standardize liturgy throughout the worldwide Church,<ref name=\"Hall100\">Hall, p. 100.</ref> and an enormous body of religious music has been composed for it through the ages. This led directly to the emergence and development of European classical music, and its many derivatives. The [[Baroque]] style, which encompassed music, art, and architecture, was particularly encouraged by the post-Reformation Catholic Church as such forms offered a means of religious expression that was stirring and emotional, intended to stimulate religious fervor.<ref name=\"Murray45\">Murray, p. 45.</ref>\n\nThe list of Catholic composers and Catholic sacred music which have a prominent place in Western culture is extensive, but includes [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s ''[[Ode to Joy]]''; [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s ''[[Ave Verum Corpus]]''; [[Franz Schubert]]'s ''[[Ave Maria]]'', [[C\u00e9sar Franck]]'s ''[[Panis angelicus]]'', and [[Antonio Vivaldi]]'s ''[[Gloria (Vivaldi)|Gloria]]''.\n\nSimilarly, the list of Catholic authors and literary works is vast. With a literary tradition spanning two millennia, the Bible and [[Papal Encyclicals]] have been constants of the Catholic canon but countless other historical works may be listed as noteworthy in terms of their influence on Western society. From late Antiquity, [[St Augustine]]'s book [[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]], which outlines his sinful youth and conversion to Christianity, is widely considered to be the first autobiography ever written in the canon of [[Western Literature]]. Augustine profoundly influenced the coming medieval worldview.<ref name=\"Wilken 2003 291\"/> The [[Summa Theologica]], written 1265\u20131274, is the best-known work of [[Thomas Aquinas]] (c.1225\u20131274), and although unfinished, \"one of the classics of the history of philosophy and one of the most influential works of Western literature.\"<ref>Ross, James F., \"Thomas Aquinas, ''Summa theologiae'' (ca. 1273), Christian Wisdom Explained Philosophically\", in ''The Classics of Western Philosophy: A Reader's Guide'', (eds.)

It presents the reasoning for almost all points of Christian theology in the West. The epic poetry of the Italian [[Dante]] and his ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' of the late [[Middle Ages]] is also considered immensely influential. The English statesman and philosopher, [[Thomas More]], wrote the seminal work [[Utopia (book)|Utopia]] in 1516.

Prominent painters with Protestant background were, for example, [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]], [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Lucas Cranach]], [[Rembrandt]], and [[Vincent van Gogh]].

The church forbade its members to do so.  Greco-Roman society saw no value in an unmarried woman, and therefore it was illegal for a widow to go more than two years without remarrying. Christianity did not force widows to marry and supported them financially. Pagan widows lost all control of their husband's estate when they remarried, but the church allowed widows to maintain their husband's estate.  Christians did not believe in cohabitation. If a Christian man wanted to live with a woman, the church required marriage, and this gave women legal rights and far greater security.  Finally, the pagan double standard of allowing married men to have extramarital sex and mistresses was forbidden. Jesus' teachings on divorce and Paul's advocacy of monogamy began the process of elevating the status of women so that Christian women tended to enjoy greater security and equality than did women in surrounding cultures.<ref name=\"Tim Keller\">{{cite book| last=Keller| first=Tim| title=The Reason for God Belief in an age of skepticism| year=2008| publisher=Penguin Books| location=New York| isbn=978-0-52595-049-3| page=[https://archive.org/details/reasonforgodbeli00kell_0/page/249 249]| url=https://archive.org/details/reasonforgodbeli00kell_0/page/249}}</ref>\n\n====Children====\nIn the ancient world infanticide was not legal but was rarely prosecuted.  A broad distinction was popularly made between infanticide and infant exposure which was practiced on a gigantic scale with impunity. Many exposed children died, but many were taken by speculators who raised them to be slaves or prostitutes. <!-- Is this appropriate here? --> It is not possible to ascertain, with any degree of accuracy, what diminution of infanticide resulted from legal efforts against it in the Roman empire.  \"It may, however, be safely asserted that the publicity of the trade in exposed children became impossible under the influence of Christianity, and that the sense of the seriousness of the crime was very considerably increased.\"<ref name=\"W. E. H. Lecky\"/>{{rp|31,32}}\n\n====Constantine====\n[[Emperor Constantine]]'s [[Edict of Milan]] in 313 AD ended the state sponsored persecution of Christians in the East and his own conversion to Christianity was a significant turning point in history.<ref>Religion in the Roman Empire, Wiley-Blackwell, by James B. Rives, page 196</ref> In 312, Constantine offered civic toleration to Christians, and through his reign instigated laws and policies in keeping with Christian principles \u2013 making Sunday the Sabbath \"day of rest\" for Roman society (though initially this was only for urban dwellers) and embarking on a church building program. In AD 325, Constantine conferred the [[First Council of Nicaea]] to gain consensus and unity within Christianity, with a view to establishing it as the religion of the Empire. The population and wealth of the Roman Empire had been shifting east, and around the year 330, Constantine established the city of [[Constantinople]] as a new imperial city which would be the capital of the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]]. The Eastern Patriarch in Constantinople now came to rival the Pope in Rome and Rome itself was [[Sack of Rome (410)|sacked by the Visigoths]] in 410 and the [[Sack of Rome (455)|Vandals in 455]]. Although cultural continuity and interchange would continue between these Eastern and Western Roman Empires, the [[history of Christianity]] and Western culture took divergent routes, with a final [[East\u2013West Schism|Great Schism]] separating [[Roman Catholicism|Roman]] and [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern]] Christianity in 1054 AD.\n\n[[File:Anthonis van Dyck 005.jpg|thumb|upright|''Saint Ambrose and Emperor Theodosius'', [[Anthony van Dyck]].]]\n[[File:Gregorythegreat.jpg|thumb|upright|Pope [[Gregory the Great]] (''c'' 540\u2013604) who established medieval themes in the Church, in a painting by [[Carlo Saraceni]], c. 1610, Rome.]]\n\nThe remarkable transformation of Christianity from peripheral sect, to major force within the Empire is illustrated by the influence held by [[St Ambrose]], the [[Bishop of Milan]]. A [[Doctor of the Church]] and one of the most influential ecclesiastical figures of the 4th century, Ambrose became a player in Imperial politics, courted for his influence by competing contenders for the Imperial throne. When the Emperor [[Theodosius I]] ordered the [[Massacre of Thessaloniki|punitive massacre of thousands of the citizens]] of [[Thessaloniki]], Ambrose admonished him publicly, refused him the Eucharist and called on him to perform a public penance, a call to which the Christian Emperor submitted.<ref>[[Wikisource:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/St. Ambrose]]</ref><ref name=\"Randall D.

In 391 Theodosius sought to block the restoration of the pagan [[Altar of Victory]] to the Roman Senate and then fought against [[Eugenius]], who courted pagan support for his own bid for the imperial throne. Thus, the ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' lauds Theodosius as:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14577d.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Theodosius I|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|[O]ne of the sovereigns by universal consent called Great.

A trained Roman lawyer and administrator, and a monk, he represents the shift from the classical to the medieval outlook and was a father of many of the structures of the later Roman Catholic Church. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, he looked upon Church and State as co-operating to form a united whole, which acted in two distinct spheres, ecclesiastical and secular, but by the time of his death, the papacy was the great power in Italy:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06780a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: St. Gregory the Great|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|[ [[Pope Gregory the Great]] ] made himself in Italy a power stronger than emperor or exarch, and established a political influence which dominated the peninsula for centuries.

Pope's were powerful enough to challenge the authority of kings. The [[Investiture Controversy]] was perhaps the most significant conflict between [[Church and state in medieval Europe]]. A series of Popes challenged the authority of monarchies over control of appointments, or [[investiture]]s, of church officials. The Court of [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], based in Sicily, saw tension and rivalry with the Papacy over control of Northern Italy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06255a.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Frederick Ii |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1 September 1909 |accessdate=16 July 2011}}</ref> The [[Avignon Papacy|Papacy had its court at Avignon]] from 1305\u201378<ref name=Morris>Morris, Colin, ''The papal monarchy: the Western church from 1050 to 1250 '', (Oxford University Press, 2001), 271.</ref> This arose from the conflict between the Italian Papacy and the French crown.\n\n\"The Popes in the fourteenth to the mid-fifteenth century turned their interest to the arts and humanities rather than to pressing moral and spiritual issues.  Moreover, they were vitally concerned with the trappings of political power. They plunged into Italian politics...ruling as secular princes in their papal lands.

The [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and [[Franciscan]] Orders were founded, which emphasized poverty and spirituality.\n\n===Crusade===\nIn 1095, [[Pope Urban II]] called for a [[Crusades|Crusade]] to re-take the [[Holy Land]] from [[Muslim]] rule.\n \n\"After Mohammad's death in 632, a series of caliphs (successors) waged energetic [[jihad]] against neighboring people's.

By the eighth century, Muslim armies had conquered all of Christian North Africa and Spain and were moving into France. In 732, at the Battle of Tours, Charles Martel defeated Muslim invaders and sent them back into Spain. By the eleventh century, the Seljuk Turks had conquered Asia Minor (modern Turkey), which had been Christian since the time of St. Paul. The holdings of the old Roman Empire, known to modern historians as the Byzantine Empire, were reduced to little more than Greece. In desperation, the emperor in Constantinople sent word to the Christians of western Europe asking them to aid their brothers and sisters in the East.\"<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.catholicity.com/commentary/madden/03463.html |title = Thomas Madden: The Real History of the Crusades}}</ref><ref name=\"Thomas F.

[[Martin Luther]] separated the religious and the worldly realms in principle ([[doctrine of the two kingdoms]]).<ref>Heinrich Bornkamm, ''Toleranz. In der Geschichte des Christentums'' in ''Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart'', 3. Auflage, Band VI (1962), col. 937</ref> The believers were obliged to use reason to govern the worldly sphere in an orderly and peaceful way. Luther's doctrine of the [[priesthood of all believers]] upgraded the role of laymen in the church considerably. The members of a congregation had the right to elect a minister and, if necessary, to vote for his dismissal (Treatise ''On the right and authority of a Christian assembly or congregation to judge all doctrines and to call, install and dismiss teachers, as testified in Scripture''; 1523).<ref>Original German title: ''Dass eine christliche Versammlung oder Gemeine Recht und Macht habe, alle Lehre zu beurteilen und Lehrer zu berufen, ein- und abzusetzen: Grund und Ursach aus der Schrift''</ref> Calvin strengthened this basically democratic approach by including elected laymen ([[church elder]]s, [[presbyter]]s) in his representative church government.<ref>Clifton E. Olmstead, ''History of Religion in the United States'', pp. 4\u201310</ref> The [[Huguenots]] added regional [[synod]]s and a national synod, whose members were elected by the congregations, to Calvin's system of church self-government. This system was taken over by the other Reformed churches.<ref>Karl Heussi, ''Kompendium der Kirchengeschichte'', 11. Auflage, p. 325</ref>\n\nPolitically, [[John Calvin]] favoured a mixture of aristocracy and democracy. He appreciated the advantages of democracy: \"It is an invaluable gift, if God allows a people to freely elect its own authorities and overlords.\"<ref>Quoted in Jan Weerda, ''Calvin'', in ''Evangelisches Soziallexikon'', 3. Auflage (1958), Stuttgart (Germany), col. 210</ref> Calvin also thought that earthly rulers lose their divine right and must be put down when they rise up against God. To further protect the rights of ordinary people, Calvin suggested separating political powers in a system of checks and balances ([[separation of powers]]). 16th-century Calvinists and Lutherans developed a theory of resistance called the [[Lesser magistrate|doctrine of the lesser magistrate]] which was later employed in the U.S. Declaration of Independence. Thus early Protestants resisted political [[Absolute monarchy|absolutism]] and paved the way for the rise of modern democracy.<ref>Clifton E. Olmstead, ''History of Religion in the United States'', p. 10</ref> Besides England, the Netherlands were, under Calvinist leadership, the freest country in Europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. It granted asylum to philosophers like [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]], [[Baruch Spinoza]] and [[Pierre Bayle]]. [[Hugo Grotius]] was able to teach his natural-law theory and a relatively liberal interpretation of the Bible.<ref>Karl Heussi, ''Kompendium der Kirchengeschichte'', S. 396\u2013397</ref>\n\nConsistent with Calvin's political ideas, Protestants created both the English and the American democracies. In 17th-century England, the most important persons and events in this process were the [[English Civil War]], [[Oliver Cromwell]], [[John Milton]], [[John Locke]], the [[Glorious Revolution]], the [[English Bill of Rights]], and the [[Act of Settlement 1701|Act of Settlement]].<ref>Cf.

By the end of the Medieval period, enslavement of Christians had been mitigated somewhat with the spread of [[serfdom]] within Europe, though outright slavery existed in European colonies in other parts of the world. Several popes issued papal bulls condemning mistreatment of enslaved Native Americans; these were largely ignored.

The ancient texts of the Bible have deeply influenced Western art, literature and culture. For centuries following the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, small monastic communities were practically the only outposts of literacy in Western Europe. In time, the Cathedral schools developed into Europe's earliest universities and the church has established thousands of primary, secondary and tertiary institutions throughout the world in the centuries since. The Church and clergymen have also sought at different times to censor texts and scholars. Thus different schools of opinion exist as to the role and influence of the Church in relation to western letters and learning.\n\nOne view, first propounded by [[The Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment philosophers]], asserts that the Church's doctrines are entirely superstitious and have hindered the progress of civilization. [[Communist states]] have made similar arguments in their education in order to inculcate a negative view of Catholicism (and religion in general) in their citizens. The most famous incidents cited by such critics are the Church's condemnations of the teachings of [[Copernicus]], [[Galileo Galilei]] and [[Johannes Kepler]].\n[[File:Active Christians in Science.jpg|thumb|200px|Set of pictures for a number of notable scientists self-identified as Christians: [[Isaac Newton]], [[Robert Boyle]], [[Francis Bacon]] and [[Johannes Kepler]].]]\nIn opposition to this view, some historians of science, including non-Catholics such as [[J.L.

Monks sought refuge at the far fringes of the known world: like Cornwall, Ireland, or the Hebrides.

Nevertheless, the most famous case of a scientist being tried for heresy arose in this field of science: the [[trial of Galileo]].\n\nThe Church's interest in astronomy began with purely practical concerns, when in the 16th century Pope Gregory XIII required astronomers to correct for the fact that the [[Julian calendar]] had fallen out of sync with the sky. Since the [[Spring equinox (Northern Hemisphere)|Spring equinox]] was tied to the celebration of Easter, the Church considered that this steady movement in the date of the equinox was undesirable. The resulting [[Gregorian calendar]] is the internationally accepted [[civil calendar]] used throughout the world today and is an important contribution of the Catholic Church to Western Civilisation.<ref>[http://www.usno.navy.mil/USNO/astronomical-applications/astronomical-information-center/calendars Introduction to Calendars].

Yet the church establishment at that time held to theories devised in pre-Christian Greece by [[Ptolemy]] and [[Aristotle]], which said that the sky revolved around the earth. When Galileo began to assert that the earth in fact revolved around the sun, he therefore found himself challenging the Church establishment at a time where the Church hierarchy also held temporal power and was engaged in the ongoing political challenge of the rise of Protestantism. After discussions with [[Pope Urban VIII]] (a man who had written admiringly of Galileo before taking papal office), Galileo believed he could avoid censure by presenting his arguments in dialogue form \u2013 but the Pope took offence when he discovered that some of his own words were being spoken by a character in the book who was a simpleton and Galileo was called for a trial before the Inquisition.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">[[Jacob Bronowski]]; ''The Ascent of Man''; Angus & Robertson, 1973 {{ISBN|0-563-17064-6}}</ref>\n\nIn this most famous example cited by critics of the Catholic Church's \"posture towards science\", [[Galileo Galilei]] [[Galileo affair|was denounced]] in 1633 for his work on the [[heliocentric]] model of the solar system, previously proposed by the Polish clergyman and intellectual Nicolaus Copernicus. Copernicus's work had been [[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium#Reception|suppressed de facto]] by the Church, but Catholic authorities were generally tolerant of discussion of the hypothesis as long as it was portrayed only as a useful mathematical fiction, and not descriptive of reality. Galileo, by contrast, argued from his unprecedented observations of the solar system that the heliocentric system was not merely an abstract model for calculating planetary motions, but actually corresponded to physical reality \u2013 that is, he insisted the planets really do orbit the Sun. After years of telescopic observation, consultations with the Popes, and verbal and written discussions with astronomers and clerics, a trial was convened by the [[Roman Inquisition|Tribunal of the Roman and Universal Inquisition]]. Galileo was found \"vehemently suspect of heresy\" (not \"guilty of heresy,\" as is frequently misreported), placed under [[house arrest]], and all of his works, including any future writings, were banned.<ref>{{anchor|_note-publication-ban}}[[#Reference-Drake-1978|Drake (1978, p.367)]], [[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|Sharratt (1994, p.184)]], [[#Reference-Favaro-1890|Favaro]] [http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=16&VOLPAG=209 (1905, 16:209,] [http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=16&VOLPAG=230 230)]{{in lang|it}}.

For about 100 years, there was no authoritative pronouncement on the subject, though many hostile comments were made by local church figures. In contrast with many Protestant objections, Catholic issues with evolutionary theory have had little to do with maintaining the literalism of the account in the [[Book of Genesis]], and have always been concerned with the question of how man came to have a soul. Modern [[Creationism]] has had little Catholic support. In the 1950s, the Church's position was one of neutrality; by the late 20th century its position evolved to one of general acceptance in recent years. However, the church insists that the human soul was immediately infused by God, and the reality of a single ancestor (commonly called [[monogenism]]) for the human race.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}\n\n{{As of|2008|alt=Today}}, the Church's official position is a fairly non-specific example of ''[[theistic evolution]]'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.catholic.com/library/adam_eve_and_evolution.asp |title=Adam, Eve, and Evolution |accessdate=10 October 2007 |author=Catholic Answers (Imprimatur Robert H.

The Church, by contrast, has consistently upheld its ideal of the dignity of each individual human life, and argues that it is as wrong to destroy an embryo as it would be to kill an adult human being; and that therefore advances in medicine can and must come without the destruction of human embryos, for example by using adult or umbilical stem cells in place of embryonic stem cells.\n\n== Art, architecture, literature, and music ==\n{{Main|Art in Roman Catholicism|List of Roman Catholic Church musicians}}\n[[File:God2-Sistine Chapel.png|thumb|300px|''The [[Creation of Adam]]'' by [[Michelangelo]] from the ceiling of the [[Sistine Chapel]].]]\n[[File:Benozzo Gozzoli 004a.jpg|thumb|upright|200px|[[Saint Thomas Aquinas]] was one of the great scholars of the Medieval period.]]\n[[File:G.

From 1100, he wrote, monumental abbeys and cathedrals were constructed and decorated with sculptures, hangings, mosaics and works belonging one of the greatest epochs of art and providing stark contrast to the monotonous and cramped conditions of ordinary living during the period. [[Abbot Suger]] of the [[Basilica of St Denis|Abbey of St. Denis]] is considered an influential early patron of Gothic architecture and believed that love of beauty brought people closer to God: \"The dull mind rises to truth through that which is material\". Clarke calls this \"the intellectual background of all the sublime works of art of the next century and in fact has remained the basis of our belief of the value of art until today\".<ref name=\"Civilisation, BBC 1969\"/>\n\nLater, during [[The Renaissance]] and [[Counter-Reformation]], Catholic artists produced many of the unsurpassed masterpieces of [[Western art]] \u2013 often inspired by Biblical themes: from Michelangelo's ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]'' and ''[[Piet\u00e0]]'' sculptures, to Da Vinci's ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo da Vinci)|Last Supper]]'' and Raphael's various ''Madonna'' paintings. Referring to a \"great outburst of creative energy such as took place in Rome between 1620 and 1660\", Kenneth Clarke wrote:<ref name=\"Civilisation, BBC 1969\"/>\n\n<blockquote>[W]ith a single exception, the great artists of the time were all sincere, conforming Christians. [[Guercino]] spent much of his mornings in prayer; [[Bernini]] frequently went into retreats and practised the [[Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola|Spiritual Exercises]] of [[Ignatius of Loyola|Saint Ignatius]]; [[Rubens]] attended Mass every morning before beginning work. The exception was [[Caravaggio]], who was like the hero of a modern play, except that he happened to paint very well.\n\nThis conformism was not based on fear of the Inquisition, but on the perfectly simple belief that the faith which had inspired the great saints of the preceding generation was something by which a man should regulate his life.</blockquote>\n\nIn music, Catholic monks developed the first forms of modern Western musical notation in order to standardize liturgy throughout the worldwide Church,<ref name=\"Hall100\">Hall, p. 100.</ref> and an enormous body of religious music has been composed for it through the ages. This led directly to the emergence and development of European classical music, and its many derivatives. The [[Baroque]] style, which encompassed music, art, and architecture, was particularly encouraged by the post-Reformation Catholic Church as such forms offered a means of religious expression that was stirring and emotional, intended to stimulate religious fervor.<ref name=\"Murray45\">Murray, p. 45.</ref>\n\nThe list of Catholic composers and Catholic sacred music which have a prominent place in Western culture is extensive, but includes [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s ''[[Ode to Joy]]''; [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s ''[[Ave Verum Corpus]]''; [[Franz Schubert]]'s ''[[Ave Maria]]'', [[C\u00e9sar Franck]]'s ''[[Panis angelicus]]'', and [[Antonio Vivaldi]]'s ''[[Gloria (Vivaldi)|Gloria]]''.\n\nSimilarly, the list of Catholic authors and literary works is vast. With a literary tradition spanning two millennia, the Bible and [[Papal Encyclicals]] have been constants of the Catholic canon but countless other historical works may be listed as noteworthy in terms of their influence on Western society. From late Antiquity, [[St Augustine]]'s book [[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]], which outlines his sinful youth and conversion to Christianity, is widely considered to be the first autobiography ever written in the canon of [[Western Literature]]. Augustine profoundly influenced the coming medieval worldview.<ref name=\"Wilken 2003 291\"/> The [[Summa Theologica]], written 1265\u20131274, is the best-known work of [[Thomas Aquinas]] (c.1225\u20131274), and although unfinished, \"one of the classics of the history of philosophy and one of the most influential works of Western literature.\"<ref>Ross, James F., \"Thomas Aquinas, ''Summa theologiae'' (ca. 1273), Christian Wisdom Explained Philosophically\", in ''The Classics of Western Philosophy: A Reader's Guide'', (eds.)

It presents the reasoning for almost all points of Christian theology in the West. The epic poetry of the Italian [[Dante]] and his ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' of the late [[Middle Ages]] is also considered immensely influential. The English statesman and philosopher, [[Thomas More]], wrote the seminal work [[Utopia (book)|Utopia]] in 1516.

Musicians like [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz]], [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], [[George Frederick Handel]], [[Henry Purcell]], [[Johannes Brahms]], and [[Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy]] composed great works of music. Prominent painters with Protestant background were, for example, [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]], [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Lucas Cranach]], [[Rembrandt]], and [[Vincent van Gogh]]. World literature was enriched by the works of [[Edmund Spenser]], [[John Milton]], [[John Bunyan]], [[John Donne]], [[John Dryden]], [[Daniel Defoe]], [[William Wordsworth]], [[Jonathan Swift]], [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]], [[Friedrich Schiller]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[Matthew Arnold]], [[Conrad Ferdinand Meyer]], [[Theodor Fontane]], [[Washington Irving]], [[Robert Browning]], [[Emily Dickinson]], [[Emily Bront\u00eb]], [[Charles Dickens]], [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], [[Thomas Stearns Eliot]], [[John Galsworthy]], [[Thomas Mann]], [[William Faulkner]], [[John Updike]], and many others.\n\n==Economic development==\n[[Francisco de Vitoria]], a disciple of [[Thomas Aquinas]] and a Catholic thinker who studied the issue regarding the human rights of colonized natives, is recognized by the United Nations as a father of international law, and now also by historians of economics and democracy as a leading light for the West's democracy and rapid economic development.<ref>{{cite web |title=A Philosophical and Historical Analysis of Modern Democracy, Equality, and Freedom Under the Influence of Christianity |url=http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/politics/pg0010.html |last=de Torre |first=Fr.

In the alternative media they were referred to as the ''Vancouver 5'', but in the mainstream press they were dubbed the ''[[Squamish 5]]''.  The group, composed of ecologists and feminists, were responsible for a number of actions, including the 14 October 1982 bombing of the [[Litton Industries]] plant in [[Ontario]] which made guidance systems for [[cruise missile]]s. The Litton bombing hurt several plant workers and three police officers were also injured. While Gerry was not part of the Litton bombing, he supported it, and did take part in other actions, as well as planning to rob a Brinks truck to fund future actions. He was arrested on 20 January 1983, along with the four other members of Direct Action. Many benefits were arranged for the group by people such as [[Jello Biafra]] and [[Joey Shithead]] of [[D.O.A.

With the line up of Wimpy Roy, Mike Graham, Ron Allan, and Randy Bowman, the Subhumans recorded the album ''[[No Wishes, No Prayers]]'' for [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]]'s [[SST Records]]. Ron Allan and Randy Bowman later went on to join the Vancouver band The Scramblers and Brian Goble went on to join D.O.A. on bass and occasional lead vocals.\n\nTheir songs have been covered by many other bands, including D.O.A., [[NoMeansNo]], [[MDC (band)|MDC]], [[Overkill (band)|Overkill]], [[Jingo de Lunch]], and Vancouver [[all-women band]] [[Cub (band)|Cub]], and they are highly regarded within the punk community.\n\nIn 2005, the Subhumans reunited with the following lineup:  [[Gerry Hannah]] on bass, [[Jon Card]] (ex-[[Personality Crisis (band)|Personality Crisis]], [[SNFU]] and [[D.O.A.

(2003) ''The Great Indie Discography'', Canongate, {{ISBN|1-84195-335-0}}, p. 157</ref>\n\nKnown by [[pejorative]], [[punk rock]] nicknames, original members were known simply as \"Useless\" ([[Gerry Hannah]]), \"Dimwit\" (Ken Montgomery), \"Wimpy\" ([[Brian Roy Goble]]) and \"Normal\" (Mike Graham).\n\n==History==\nDimwit quit the band shortly after their first 7\" was released to join the Pointed Sticks and was replaced by Koichi Imagawa, also known as Jim Imagawa, on drums.<ref name=\"Strong\" />\n\nIn 1981, Hannah left the band and gradually became involved with a small group of underground activists calling themselves ''Direct Action''. In the alternative media they were referred to as the ''Vancouver 5'', but in the mainstream press they were dubbed the ''[[Squamish 5]]''.  The group, composed of ecologists and feminists, were responsible for a number of actions, including the 14 October 1982 bombing of the [[Litton Industries]] plant in [[Ontario]] which made guidance systems for [[cruise missile]]s. The Litton bombing hurt several plant workers and three police officers were also injured. While Gerry was not part of the Litton bombing, he supported it, and did take part in other actions, as well as planning to rob a Brinks truck to fund future actions. He was arrested on 20 January 1983, along with the four other members of Direct Action. Many benefits were arranged for the group by people such as [[Jello Biafra]] and [[Joey Shithead]] of [[D.O.A. (band)|D.O.A.]] to pay lawyers fees but, in the end, Hannah pleaded guilty to avoid years in prison. He received a 10-year sentence and was released after serving 5 years.<ref name=\"Strong\" /><ref name=\"soleil\">{{citation | last = Bussi\u00e8res | first = Ian| title = D\u00e9neigeur le jour, punk rocker la nuit | newspaper = [[Le Soleil (Quebec)|Le Soleil]] | date = 18 September 2010 | url = http://www.cyberpresse.ca/le-soleil/arts-et-spectacles/sur-scene/201009/17/01-4316803-deneigeur-le-jour-punk-rocker-la-nuit.php}}</ref> During his time in prison, he began writing a column for the [[fanzine]] [[Maximum RocknRoll]] which helped maintain his connection to the punk scene. A number of years after his release he was the subject of a documentary film made by B.C. filmmaker Glen Sanford, called ''Useless''.\n\nAfter Hannah left the band, the Subhumans re-formed with Ron Allan on bass.<ref name=\"Strong\" /> After Imagawa left the band, Dimwit was briefly back with the Subhumans before Randy Bowman joined in his place. With the line up of Wimpy Roy, Mike Graham, Ron Allan, and Randy Bowman, the Subhumans recorded the album ''[[No Wishes, No Prayers]]'' for [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]]'s [[SST Records]]. Ron Allan and Randy Bowman later went on to join the Vancouver band The Scramblers and Brian Goble went on to join D.O.A. on bass and occasional lead vocals.\n\nTheir songs have been covered by many other bands, including D.O.A., [[NoMeansNo]], [[MDC (band)|MDC]], [[Overkill (band)|Overkill]], [[Jingo de Lunch]], and Vancouver [[all-women band]] [[Cub (band)|Cub]], and they are highly regarded within the punk community.\n\nIn 2005, the Subhumans reunited with the following lineup:  [[Gerry Hannah]] on bass, [[Jon Card]] (ex-[[Personality Crisis (band)|Personality Crisis]], [[SNFU]] and [[D.O.A. (band)|D.O.A.]]) on drums, [[Wimpy Roy]] on vocals and Mike Graham on guitar.<ref name=\"soleil\"/> They signed to [[Alternative Tentacles]] and [[G7 Welcoming Committee Records]]. A new album, ''New Dark Age Parade'', was released in September 2006.  ''Death Was Too Kind'', a compilation of the band's early singles and EPs, was released in 2008. In 2010, the band released the album ''Same Thoughts, Different Day'', a re-recorded version of ''Incorrect Thoughts'', after legal issues prevented the band from reissuing the original album.\n\nThe Subhumans were featured in the 2010 documentary film ''Bloodied but Unbowed'', directed by  Susanne Tabata.<ref name=vc>[http://www.vancourier.com/entertainment/vancouver-punk-rock-doc-now-with-jello-1.387593 \"Vancouver punk rock doc... now with Jello\"].
