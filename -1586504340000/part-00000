It was built in 1730 by [[Baron Clinton|Hugh Fortescue, 14th Baron Clinton]] (1696\u20131751), who was later created in 1751 1st [[Earl Fortescue|Baron Fortescue]] and 1st [[Baron Clinton|Earl of Clinton]], the son of Hugh Fortescue (died 1719), [[lord of the manor]] of Filleigh, Weare Giffard, etc., whose family is earliest recorded as residing in the 12th century at the manor of [[Whympston, Modbury|Whympston]] in the parish of [[Modbury]] in South Devon. The [[Earl Fortescue|Fortescue family]] became major land owners, influential in British and [[Westcountry|West Country]] history. Castle Hill is a rare example in Devon of an 18th-century [[country house|country mansion]] \"on the grand scale\".<ref>Cherry, p.247</ref>\n\nThe house was substantially reconstructed following a disastrous fire in 1934. It was designated a Grade II* [[listed building]] in 1967. The park and gardens are Grade I listed in the [[National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens]].<ref>{{NHLE |num=1000120 |desc=Castle Hill |accessdate=13 February 2016}}</ref> Today the property is leased by [[Arthur Gore, 9th Earl of Arran|Eleanor, Countess of Arran]] (born 1949), the grand-daughter of [[Hugh Fortescue, 5th Earl Fortescue]] (1888\u20131958).\n\n==Predecessor==\nThe [[manor]] of Filleigh has been held by the Fortescue family since the 15th century, although the family's main seat until the late 17th century was [[Weare Giffard]], some {{convert|12|mi|km|abbr=on}} to the west. An older late [[Tudor architecture|Tudor]] [[manor house]] on the site was re-modelled in 1684 by Arthur Fortescue and his son [[Hugh Fortescue (1665\u20131719)|Hugh Fortescue]] (died 1719). A plaque to the left of the north entrance front of the main range is inscribed in Latin: {{lang|lat|Re-Edificat(us) Per Arthur Fortescue AR(miger) AD 1684}} (\"Re-built by Arthur Fortescue, esquire, AD 1684\").<ref>Listed buildings text</ref>\n \nLady Fortescue kept a record of the rainfall at Filleigh Castle Hill.  A project being carried out at the University of Reading is recording handwritten weather records from the past. Her name is shown as being the observer making the records at Filleigh Castle Hill.\n\n==Palladian rebuilding==\nHugh Fortescue (1696\u20131751), who in 1721 inherited the title 14th [[Baron Clinton]], via his mother, consulted [[Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington|Lord Burlington]] (1694\u20131753), the pioneer and arbiter of Palladianism in England, on the design of his proposed new mansion. In 1728/9 he appointed Burlington's favoured builder Roger Morris to reface the house in [[Portland stone]]. The former hall was remodelled as a double-height saloon.\n\n==19th-century additions==\n[[File:CastleHillDevonBloreServiceWing.jpg|thumb|200px|Service wing to east side of house, 1861, to design of Blore, with clock tower above. Viewed from south]]\n[[File:CastleHillFilleighStableBlock.jpg|thumb|200px|The stable block, viewed from the east. The main vehicular entrance to the house is through the large arch along a road which passes directly in front of the service block, the clock tower of which can be seen behind. The main range is visible to the left (south)]]\nA circular library was added in the early 19th century. In 1841 the architect [[Edward Blore]] (1787\u20131879) added a [[porte-cochere]] on the north side of the main range, now demolished and replaced in 1974 by an entrance porch to the design of Raymond Erith. Blore also refashioned the entrance hall and stairs and added a top storey with [[mansard roof]]. In 1861 Blore added at the east side of the house service wings and stables, thus considerably elongating the southern appearance of the building beyond the east wing. The service wing is set back from the east wing by the width of the entry road which passes directly in front of it, and is topped in its centre by a clock tower. Adjoining it on its east end and extending backwards to give the ensemble an L-shape, is Blore's stable block. This has small circular windows with portrait busts, and is pierced on its long eastern face by the imposing full height main entrance arch, through which vehicles pass and continue past the front of the service wing and through decorative inner gates into the courtyard situated between the north facade of the main range and the steep and rocky hillside.\n\n==1934 fire damage==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = CastleHillFilleighEntranceApproach.jpg\n| width1 = 85\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = CastleHillFilleighDevonMainCourtyard.jpg\n| width2 = 150\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Left: Castle Hill, entry approach road viewed from under entrance arch looking west towards decorative iron gates to inner courtyard, Service Block to right, beyond which is (right): North Front and main entrance courtyard, viewed westwards from gates from service courtyard, situated behind service block\n}}\nA major fire broke out in the early morning of 9 March 1934 and burned for two days. It destroyed much of the interior and killed two members of staff, the housekeeper and a maid. The 5th Earl had recently installed a central heating system, the boiler of which, situated underneath the library floor, had malfunctioned. After the fire the house  was restored to the 18th-century style by [[Gerald Wellesley, 7th Duke of Wellington|Lord Gerald Wellesley]] (1885\u20131972), soldier, diplomat and architect, with Trenwith Wills. Although 49 paintings, including many Fortescue family portraits, were saved from the fire with only minor smoke damage, all were shortly afterwards destroyed by fire when the delivery lorry returning them from the restorer caught fire whilst parked overnight in a garage pending their return to Castle Hill.<ref>Lauder, R. op.cit. p.81</ref>\n\n==Grounds==\n[[File:CastleHillFilleighFromOxfordDown.jpg|thumb|200px|Castle Hill, panoramic view of west side, seen from Oxford Down Hill looking eastwards. A large \"Peace Clump\" of Scots Pine trees was planted on Oxford Down by the 4th Earl in 1919 to commemorate the end of World War I.<ref>Filleigh History Group, p.9</ref>]]\nThe house is surrounded by landscaped grounds containing many picturesque structures and decorative ''[[Folly|points-de-vue]]''. The former include three small classical-style [[Greek temple]]s, the Sunrise Temple (1831), the Sunset Temple (1831) and [[Satyr]]'s Temple (1861); the Traveller's Cross, erected in 1831, but formerly situated on a roadside near North Aller; Ugley Bridge (1861), an imitation of an old Devon packhorse bridge; The [[Sibyl|Sybil]]s' Cave (1861), filled in while the house served as a home for evacuated children during [[World War II]], but since re-opened. The ancient parish church formerly situated next to the former pre-Palladian manor house was demolished in 1732 by Lord Clinton with the licence of Stephen Weston, [[Bishop of Exeter]], and was rebuilt to a new design in its present position some {{convert|1|mi|km|abbr=on}} to the west of the house, visible from the terrace. This made available an unencumbered site for the planned landscaping. Other ''points-de-vue'' include the Sham Castle, the Triumphal Arch, the Ebrington Tower and the Sham Village (now demolished).\n\n===Sham castle===\n[[File:ShamCastle CastleHill Filleigh.jpg|thumb|200px|Architectural \"Sham Castle\" on top of hill to immediate north of house, with decorative cannon aimed southward, viewed from SW]]\nA sham castle dating from about 1746, occupies the hill behind the house to the north, possibly inspired by [[Vanbrugh]], and is said to be the feature which gave the house its name. When [[Lord Lieutenant of Devon]], [[Hugh Fortescue, 4th Earl Fortescue]] (1854\u20131932) flew the Fortescue [[heraldic flag|standard]] from the castle, and noted in his diary that his ancestor [[Matthew Fortescue, 2nd Baron Fortescue]] (d.1785) had \"armed\" it, as a modern reference to which in 1991 Lady Margaret Fortescue installed the decorative cannon now present on its south lawn. It served for a while as a banqueting hall, at which time it was lined with oak panelling from nearby North Aller House, which in 1812 was moved on to [[Weare Giffard]] Hall. The building was later converted into a dwelling house, originally intended for a couple to tend the tame pheasants, and later lived in by the huntsman of the Fortescue [[Harrier (dog)|Harriers]], Abraham Moggeridge. From the castle can be seen to the west [[Lundy Island]] and at a closer distance, Bampfylde Clump to the north in [[North Molton]] parish.\n\n===Triumphal arch===\n[[File:Castle Hill Triumphal Arch.jpg|thumb|200px|Triumphal Arch on top of hill opposite south front of house, here viewed from the Sham Castle]]\nThe original [[Triumphal Arch]], situated on top of the hill {{convert|1/2|mi|m|abbr=off}} opposite the south front of the house and on the same axis as the sham castle behind, was built by Lord Clinton in 1730. It had been allowed to become covered in ivy and in 1951 collapsed during a strong wind. Following the death of both her parents in 1958, Lady Margaret Fortescue in 1961 rebuilt the Arch in its original form in their memory.

It was built in 1730 by [[Baron Clinton|Hugh Fortescue, 14th Baron Clinton]] (1696\u20131751), who was later created in 1751 1st [[Earl Fortescue|Baron Fortescue]] and 1st [[Baron Clinton|Earl of Clinton]], the son of Hugh Fortescue (died 1719), [[lord of the manor]] of Filleigh, Weare Giffard, etc., whose family is earliest recorded as residing in the 12th century at the manor of [[Whympston, Modbury|Whympston]] in the parish of [[Modbury]] in South Devon. The [[Earl Fortescue|Fortescue family]] became major land owners, influential in British and [[Westcountry|West Country]] history. Castle Hill is a rare example in Devon of an 18th-century [[country house|country mansion]] \"on the grand scale\".<ref>Cherry, p.247</ref>\n\nThe house was substantially reconstructed following a disastrous fire in 1934. It was designated a Grade II* [[listed building]] in 1967. The park and gardens are Grade I listed in the [[National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens]].<ref>{{NHLE |num=1000120 |desc=Castle Hill |accessdate=13 February 2016}}</ref> Today the property is leased by [[Arthur Gore, 9th Earl of Arran|Eleanor, Countess of Arran]] (born 1949), the grand-daughter of [[Hugh Fortescue, 5th Earl Fortescue]] (1888\u20131958).\n\n==Predecessor==\nThe [[manor]] of Filleigh has been held by the Fortescue family since the 15th century, although the family's main seat until the late 17th century was [[Weare Giffard]], some {{convert|12|mi|km|abbr=on}} to the west. An older late [[Tudor architecture|Tudor]] [[manor house]] on the site was re-modelled in 1684 by Arthur Fortescue and his son [[Hugh Fortescue (1665\u20131719)|Hugh Fortescue]] (died 1719). A plaque to the left of the north entrance front of the main range is inscribed in Latin: {{lang|lat|Re-Edificat(us) Per Arthur Fortescue AR(miger) AD 1684}} (\"Re-built by Arthur Fortescue, esquire, AD 1684\").<ref>Listed buildings text</ref>\n \nLady Fortescue kept a record of the rainfall at Filleigh Castle Hill.  A project being carried out at the University of Reading is recording handwritten weather records from the past. Her name is shown as being the observer making the records at Filleigh Castle Hill.\n\n==Palladian rebuilding==\nHugh Fortescue (1696\u20131751), who in 1721 inherited the title 14th [[Baron Clinton]], via his mother, consulted [[Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington|Lord Burlington]] (1694\u20131753), the pioneer and arbiter of Palladianism in England, on the design of his proposed new mansion. In 1728/9 he appointed Burlington's favoured builder Roger Morris to reface the house in [[Portland stone]]. The former hall was remodelled as a double-height saloon.\n\n==19th-century additions==\n[[File:CastleHillDevonBloreServiceWing.jpg|thumb|200px|Service wing to east side of house, 1861, to design of Blore, with clock tower above.

The main vehicular entrance to the house is through the large arch along a road which passes directly in front of the service block, the clock tower of which can be seen behind. The main range is visible to the left (south)]]\nA circular library was added in the early 19th century. In 1841 the architect [[Edward Blore]] (1787\u20131879) added a [[porte-cochere]] on the north side of the main range, now demolished and replaced in 1974 by an entrance porch to the design of Raymond Erith. Blore also refashioned the entrance hall and stairs and added a top storey with [[mansard roof]]. In 1861 Blore added at the east side of the house service wings and stables, thus considerably elongating the southern appearance of the building beyond the east wing. The service wing is set back from the east wing by the width of the entry road which passes directly in front of it, and is topped in its centre by a clock tower. Adjoining it on its east end and extending backwards to give the ensemble an L-shape, is Blore's stable block. This has small circular windows with portrait busts, and is pierced on its long eastern face by the imposing full height main entrance arch, through which vehicles pass and continue past the front of the service wing and through decorative inner gates into the courtyard situated between the north facade of the main range and the steep and rocky hillside.\n\n==1934 fire damage==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = CastleHillFilleighEntranceApproach.jpg\n| width1 = 85\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = CastleHillFilleighDevonMainCourtyard.jpg\n| width2 = 150\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Left: Castle Hill, entry approach road viewed from under entrance arch looking west towards decorative iron gates to inner courtyard, Service Block to right, beyond which is (right): North Front and main entrance courtyard, viewed westwards from gates from service courtyard, situated behind service block\n}}\nA major fire broke out in the early morning of 9 March 1934 and burned for two days. It destroyed much of the interior and killed two members of staff, the housekeeper and a maid. The 5th Earl had recently installed a central heating system, the boiler of which, situated underneath the library floor, had malfunctioned. After the fire the house  was restored to the 18th-century style by [[Gerald Wellesley, 7th Duke of Wellington|Lord Gerald Wellesley]] (1885\u20131972), soldier, diplomat and architect, with Trenwith Wills. Although 49 paintings, including many Fortescue family portraits, were saved from the fire with only minor smoke damage, all were shortly afterwards destroyed by fire when the delivery lorry returning them from the restorer caught fire whilst parked overnight in a garage pending their return to Castle Hill.<ref>Lauder, R. op.cit. p.81</ref>\n\n==Grounds==\n[[File:CastleHillFilleighFromOxfordDown.jpg|thumb|200px|Castle Hill, panoramic view of west side, seen from Oxford Down Hill looking eastwards. A large \"Peace Clump\" of Scots Pine trees was planted on Oxford Down by the 4th Earl in 1919 to commemorate the end of World War I.<ref>Filleigh History Group, p.9</ref>]]\nThe house is surrounded by landscaped grounds containing many picturesque structures and decorative ''[[Folly|points-de-vue]]''. The former include three small classical-style [[Greek temple]]s, the Sunrise Temple (1831), the Sunset Temple (1831) and [[Satyr]]'s Temple (1861); the Traveller's Cross, erected in 1831, but formerly situated on a roadside near North Aller; Ugley Bridge (1861), an imitation of an old Devon packhorse bridge; The [[Sibyl|Sybil]]s' Cave (1861), filled in while the house served as a home for evacuated children during [[World War II]], but since re-opened. The ancient parish church formerly situated next to the former pre-Palladian manor house was demolished in 1732 by Lord Clinton with the licence of Stephen Weston, [[Bishop of Exeter]], and was rebuilt to a new design in its present position some {{convert|1|mi|km|abbr=on}} to the west of the house, visible from the terrace. This made available an unencumbered site for the planned landscaping. Other ''points-de-vue'' include the Sham Castle, the Triumphal Arch, the Ebrington Tower and the Sham Village (now demolished).\n\n===Sham castle===\n[[File:ShamCastle CastleHill Filleigh.jpg|thumb|200px|Architectural \"Sham Castle\" on top of hill to immediate north of house, with decorative cannon aimed southward, viewed from SW]]\nA sham castle dating from about 1746, occupies the hill behind the house to the north, possibly inspired by [[Vanbrugh]], and is said to be the feature which gave the house its name. When [[Lord Lieutenant of Devon]], [[Hugh Fortescue, 4th Earl Fortescue]] (1854\u20131932) flew the Fortescue [[heraldic flag|standard]] from the castle, and noted in his diary that his ancestor [[Matthew Fortescue, 2nd Baron Fortescue]] (d.1785) had \"armed\" it, as a modern reference to which in 1991 Lady Margaret Fortescue installed the decorative cannon now present on its south lawn. It served for a while as a banqueting hall, at which time it was lined with oak panelling from nearby North Aller House, which in 1812 was moved on to [[Weare Giffard]] Hall. The building was later converted into a dwelling house, originally intended for a couple to tend the tame pheasants, and later lived in by the huntsman of the Fortescue [[Harrier (dog)|Harriers]], Abraham Moggeridge. From the castle can be seen to the west [[Lundy Island]] and at a closer distance, Bampfylde Clump to the north in [[North Molton]] parish.\n\n===Triumphal arch===\n[[File:Castle Hill Triumphal Arch.jpg|thumb|200px|Triumphal Arch on top of hill opposite south front of house, here viewed from the Sham Castle]]\nThe original [[Triumphal Arch]], situated on top of the hill {{convert|1/2|mi|m|abbr=off}} opposite the south front of the house and on the same axis as the sham castle behind, was built by Lord Clinton in 1730. It had been allowed to become covered in ivy and in 1951 collapsed during a strong wind. Following the death of both her parents in 1958, Lady Margaret Fortescue in 1961 rebuilt the Arch in its original form in their memory.

The aim of the game is to keep the hoop upright for long periods of time, or to do various [[juggling trick|tricks]].\n\nHoop rolling has been documented since antiquity in Africa, Asia and Europe. Played as a [[target practice|target game]], it is an ancient tradition widely dispersed among different societies. In Asia, the earliest records date from Ancient China, and in Europe from Ancient Greece.\n\nIn the West, the most common materials for the equipment have been wood and metal. Wooden hoops, driven with a stick about one foot long, are struck with the centre or the 2/3 point of the stick in order to ensure good progress. Metal hoops, instead of being struck, are often guided by a metal hook.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Boy's Treasury of Sports, Pastimes, and Recreations: With Nearly Four Hundred Engravings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QvQ-AAAAYAAJ|year=1848|publisher=J.P.

The process repeats until he strikes the side of a gate, then he and the turnpike keeper switch places.\n\nConflict games such as \"hoop battle\" or \"tournament\" can also be played.

The aim of the game is to keep the hoop upright for long periods of time, or to do various [[juggling trick|tricks]].\n\nHoop rolling has been documented since antiquity in Africa, Asia and Europe. Played as a [[target practice|target game]], it is an ancient tradition widely dispersed among different societies. In Asia, the earliest records date from Ancient China, and in Europe from Ancient Greece.\n\nIn the West, the most common materials for the equipment have been wood and metal. Wooden hoops, driven with a stick about one foot long, are struck with the centre or the 2/3 point of the stick in order to ensure good progress. Metal hoops, instead of being struck, are often guided by a metal hook.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Boy's Treasury of Sports, Pastimes, and Recreations: With Nearly Four Hundred Engravings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QvQ-AAAAYAAJ|year=1848|publisher=J.P.

The Greeks called the hoop trocoVor krikoV. They were rather large, and made of metal studded with tinkling bells and propelled by a metal rod. Ganymede is often represented with such a hoop.

In order that the passers-by may get out of the way of the hoop.\"(14. CLXIX) He also indicates that the metal tires of wooden cart wheels could be used as hoops: \"A wheel must be protected.

After running all the gates, the openings are made smaller by one inch, and the player trundling the hoop runs the course again. The process repeats until he strikes the side of a gate, then he and the turnpike keeper switch places.\n\nConflict games such as \"hoop battle\" or \"tournament\" can also be played. For this game, boys organise into opposing teams that drive their hoops against each other with the aim of knocking down as many of the opponents' hoops as possible.

The squadron deployed to Egypt between 6 November and 28 December 1956.  A detachment to Northern Ireland in 1957 was followed by moves to Felixstowe in May 1958, [[RAF Upwood]] in July 1962 and [[RAF Catterick|Catterick]] in July 1964. Over the period 1959-1970 the squadron saw deployments to [[Gan Island|Gan]], [[Aden]], [[Antigua]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Northern Ireland]].  The squadron was equipped with the [[Tigercat]] missile system between 1967 and 1978, and during this period it undertook further deployments to [[Northern Ireland]] between 1971 and 1975 and [[British Honduras/Belize]] in 1972 and from 1976 to 1994.  The squadron re-roled as a [[Short Range Air Defence]] (SHORAD) unit with the [[Rapier Field Standard A]] system in 1978 and relocated to [[RAF Lossiemouth]].  Initially, the system used by the squadron was optical only, but it received [[DN181 Blindfire]] radar trackers in 1983.  It  eventually saw an equipment uplift to [[Rapier Field Standard B1]] (Modifled). In the period after its move to [[RAF Lossiemouth]] it undertook operational deployments to [[Belize]], [[the Falkland Island]]s and [[RAF Akrotiri]] in [[Cyprus]].  It re-located to [[RAF Waddington]] in 1996 where it became a 'cadreised' unit (joint regular/reserve) collocated with 27 Sqn RAF Regt, and disbanded at [[RAF Waddington]] in October 1998. || \n|-\n| 54 Squadron RAF Regiment ||  ||  || \n|-\n| 56 Squadron RAF Regiment ||  ||  || \n|-\n| 57 Squadron RAF Regiment ||  ||  || \n|-\n| 58 Squadron RAF Regiment ||  || RAF Catterick || Disbanded 2014\n|-\n| 60 Squadron RAF Regiment ||  ||  || \n|-\n| 66 Squadron RAF Regiment ||  ||  [[RAF West Raynham]]\n| \n|-\n| 194 Squadron RAF Regiment ||  ||  || \n|}\n'''2700-2799'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Over the period 1959-1970 the squadron saw deployments to [[Gan]], [[Aden]], [[Antigua]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Northern Ireland]].  The squadron was equipped with the [[Tigercat]] missile system between 1967 and 1978, and during this period it undertook further deployments to [[Northern Ireland]] between 1971 and 1975 and [[British Honduras/Belize]] in 1972 and from 1976 to 1994.  The squadron re-roled as a [[Short Range Air Defence]] (SHORAD) unit with the [[Rapier Field Standard A]] system in 1978 and relocated to [[RAF Lossiemouth]].  Initially, the system used by the squadron was optical only, but it received [[DN181 Blindfire]] radar trackers in 1983.  It  eventually saw an equipment uplift to [[Rapier Field Standard B1]] (Modifled). In the period after its move to [[RAF Lossiemouth]] it undertook operational deployments to [[Belize]], [[the Falkland Island]]s and [[RAF Akrotiri]] in [[Cyprus]].  It re-located to [[RAF Waddington]] in 1996 where it became a 'cadreised' unit (joint regular/reserve) collocated with 27 Sqn RAF Regt, and disbanded at [[RAF Waddington]] in October 1998. || \n|-\n| 54 Squadron RAF Regiment ||  ||  || \n|-\n| 56 Squadron RAF Regiment ||  ||  || \n|-\n| 57 Squadron RAF Regiment ||  ||  || \n|-\n| 58 Squadron RAF Regiment ||  || RAF Catterick || Disbanded 2014\n|-\n| 60 Squadron RAF Regiment ||  ||  || \n|-\n| 66 Squadron RAF Regiment ||  ||  [[RAF West Raynham]]\n| \n|-\n| 194 Squadron RAF Regiment ||  ||  || \n|}\n'''2700-2799'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The club fields a team in both the Men's SBL (MSBL) and Women's SBL (WSBL). The club is a division of Kalamunda & Districts Basketball Association (KDBA), the major administrative basketball organisation in the [[City of Kalamunda]]. The Suns play their home games at Ray Owen Sports Centre.\n\n==Club history==\n===Background===\nKalamunda & Districts Basketball Association (KDBA) was incorporated on 1 October 1971.<ref name=history1>{{cite web | url=http://kalamundabasketball.com.au/about-us/our-history/ | title=OUR HISTORY | work=KalamundaBasketball.com.au | accessdate=21 March 2017}}</ref> In 1991, after a period of non affiliation with [[Basketball Western Australia]], KDBA entered teams as the Kalamunda Hornets in the WA Junior State League competition.<ref name=history2>{{cite web | url=http://websites.sportstg.com/assoc_page.cgi?c=0-5053-0-0-0&sID=149729 | title=Eastern Suns History | work=SportsTG.com | accessdate=16 October 2017}}</ref> After a decade of little success for KDBA, Basketball Western Australia encouraged the amalgamation of KDBA and their regional rival [[Swan City Mustangs|Swan Districts Basketball Association]] (SDBA). For a number of years, Kalamunda and Swans both entered about 9\u201312 of the 14 available divisions\u2014Basketball WA sought to fill all divisions. This led to Hills Raiders Basketball Association (HRBA) seeking an opportunity for their players to access this level of competition. As a result, a new association called Eastern Region Basketball Association (ERBA), playing as Eastern Suns, was formed in 2001. Inaugural President was Bob Little (HRBA President & SDBA Life Member) and all three associations had two representatives with ERBA. Initially there was input from all three associations. However, this deteriorated when Swans (SDBA) found themselves in financial difficulty with increasing debt to Basketball WA. KDBA was in a position to seek a license from the [[State Basketball League]] (SBL) but was unwilling to assume the SDBA debt as part of their license (in excess of $40,000). Swan City Mustangs SBL and Association ceased to operate following the 2003 season.<ref name=\"history2\" />\n\nIn 2005, Basketball WA indicated that they would not be happy with the Eastern Suns (ERBA) having SDBA as part of the structure at either WABL or SBL level. They were only prepared to support an affiliated Association as the governing body of the WABL program. There were a series of meetings where SDBA maintained they still existed and HRBA sought to have representative involvement. Subsequently, HRBA declined to remain involved, and on 12 January 2006, ERBA was formally disbanded.<ref name=\"history2\" /> In March 2006, the KDBA introduced their representative arm as the '''Kalamunda Eastern Suns'''. A formal approach to join the SBL was made and initial indications were that 2007 would be possible. Subsequently, Basketball WA made a statement in March 2007 that Kalamunda could enter the SBL competition with both Men's and Women's teams in 2008.<ref name=\"history2\" />\n\n===SBL===\nIn 2008, Kalamunda & Districts Basketball Association (KDBA) secured a Men's and Women's SBL license. The inaugural men's coach was Joe Mackay, while Craig Mansfield and Rob Butt coached the women's team.<ref name=\"history1\" /> While the men's team finished in ninth place with a 12\u201314 record,

(SBL) club based in [[Perth|Perth, Western Australia]]. The club fields a team in both the Men's SBL (MSBL) and Women's SBL (WSBL). The club is a division of Kalamunda & Districts Basketball Association (KDBA), the major administrative basketball organisation in the [[City of Kalamunda]]. The Suns play their home games at Ray Owen Sports Centre.\n\n==Club history==\n===Background===\nKalamunda & Districts Basketball Association (KDBA) was incorporated on 1 October 1971.<ref name=history1>{{cite web | url=http://kalamundabasketball.com.au/about-us/our-history/ | title=OUR HISTORY | work=KalamundaBasketball.com.au | accessdate=21 March 2017}}</ref> In 1991, after a period of non affiliation with [[Basketball Western Australia]], KDBA entered teams as the Kalamunda Hornets in the WA Junior State League competition.<ref name=history2>{{cite web | url=http://websites.sportstg.com/assoc_page.cgi?c=0-5053-0-0-0&sID=149729 | title=Eastern Suns History | work=SportsTG.com | accessdate=16 October 2017}}</ref> After a decade of little success for KDBA, Basketball Western Australia encouraged the amalgamation of KDBA and their regional rival [[Swan City Mustangs|Swan Districts Basketball Association]] (SDBA). For a number of years, Kalamunda and Swans both entered about 9\u201312 of the 14 available divisions\u2014Basketball WA sought to fill all divisions. This led to Hills Raiders Basketball Association (HRBA) seeking an opportunity for their players to access this level of competition. As a result, the Association of Eastern Region Basketball Association (ERBA), playing as Eastern Suns, was formed in 2001. Inaugural President was Bob Little (HRBA President & SDBA Life Member) and all three associations had two representatives with ERBA. Initially there was input from all three associations. However, this deteriorated when Swans (SDBA) found themselves in financial difficulty with increasing debt to Basketball WA. KDBA was in a position to seek a license from the [[State Basketball League]] (SBL) but was unwilling to assume the SDBA debt as part of their license (in excess of $40,000). Swan City Mustangs SBL and Association ceased to operate following the 2003 season.<ref name=\"history2\" />\n\nIn 2005, Basketball WA indicated that they would not be happy with the Eastern Suns (ERBA) having SDBA as part of the structure at either WABL or SBL level. They were only prepared to support an affiliated Association as the governing body of the WABL program. There were a series of meetings where SDBA maintained they still existed and HRBA sought to have representative involvement. Subsequently, HRBA declined to remain involved, and on 12 January 2006, ERBA was formally disbanded.<ref name=\"history2\" /> In March 2006, the KDBA introduced their representative arm as the '''Kalamunda Eastern Suns'''. A formal approach to join the SBL was made and initial indications were that 2007 would be possible. Subsequently, Basketball WA made a statement in March 2007 that Kalamunda could enter the SBL competition with both Men's and Women's teams in 2008.<ref name=\"history2\" />\n\n===SBL===\nIn 2008, Kalamunda & Districts Basketball Association (KDBA) secured a Men's and Women's SBL license. The inaugural men's coach was Joe Mackay, while Craig Mansfield and Rob Butt coached the women's team.<ref name=\"history1\" /> While the men's team finished in ninth place with a 12\u201314 record, the women's earned a finals berth with a sixth-place finish and a 13\u201311 record.<ref name=guide>{{cite web | url=http://websites.sportstg.com/get_file.cgi?id=3521417 | title=2015 SBL Media Guide |
