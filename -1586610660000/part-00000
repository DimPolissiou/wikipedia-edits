It is also the county through which the river [[Danube]] enters Romania.\n\nThe mountains make up 67% of the county's surface, including the [[Southern Carpathians]] range, with [[Banat Mountains]], [[\u021aarcu Mountains|\u021aarcu-Godeanu Mountains]] and [[Cernei Mountains]] and elevations between 600 and 2100 meters. Transition hills between mountains and the [[Banat Plain]] lie in the western side of the county.\n\nThe [[Danube]] enters Romania in the vicinity of [[Bazia\u0219]], bordering [[Serbia]]. [[Timi\u0219 (river)|Timi\u0219]], [[Cerna (Danube)|Cerna]], [[Cara\u0219 River|Cara\u0219]] and [[Nera (Danube)|Nera]] cross the county, some of them through spectacular valleys and gorges.\n\n=== Neighbours ===\n{{Romanian counties map}}\n* [[Hunedoara County]] and [[Gorj County]] to the east.\n* [[Timi\u0219 County]] to the north.\n* [[Mehedin\u021bi County]] to the southeast.\n* [[Serbia]] to the southwest:\n** [[Vojvodina]] Autonomous Province to the west \u2013 [[South Banat District|South Banat okrug]].\n** [[Bor District]] and [[Brani\u010devo District]] to the south.\n\n== History and economy ==\nIn 1718 the county was part of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], part of the province of [[Banat of Temeswar|Banat]]. In 1771 the county seat, Reschitz ([[Re\u0219i\u021ba]]) became a modern industrial center under Austrian rule. The area received considerable attention due to its [[mining]] industry. In 1855, the entire Banat area, with its supplies of mineral deposits and timber, was transferred from the Austrian Treasury to a joint Austrian-French mining and railroad company named [[Imperial Austrian State Railways|StEG]]. StEG built the [[Oravi\u021ba]]-[[Bazia\u0219]] line, Romania's oldest railroad track.\n\nAfter World War I, StEG, Banat and most [[Austro-Hungarian Empire|Austro-Hungarian]] property were taken over by a company named UDR. During the last years of World War II, when Romania was an ally of [[Nazi Germany]], a [[Partisan (military)|partisan]] group, led by [[\u0218tefan Plav\u0103\u021b]], was active in the mountainous area of the county.<ref>Covaci, Maria (1969). \"\u0218tefan Plav\u0103\u021b\" in ''Anale de Istorie'', Vol. XV, Nr. 4.

There is a County Museum of History in Re\u0219i\u021ba, displaying archeological artifacts, and, in the town of [[Ocna de Fier]], the [[Constantin Gruiescu]] Mineralogical Collection. The county hosts the regional [[daffodil]] and [[lilac]] festivals in the Spring.\nSites worth visiting:\n* [[Cheile Nerei-Beusnita National Park|Cheile Nerei \u2013 Beu\u0219inta National Park]];\n*

the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] in 1920 under the [[Treaty of Trianon]]. The county was located in the southwestern part of [[Greater Romania]], in the south and east region of the [[Banat]]. The county seat was [[Lugoj]]. Its territory consisted entirely of the current territory of the county, but also parts of the current counties of [[Timi\u0219 County|Timi\u0219]], [[Arad County|Arad]], and [[Mehedin\u021bi County|Mehedin\u021bi]]. It bordered on the west with [[Timi\u0219-Torontal County]] and the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], to the south with Yugoslavia, to the east with the counties [[Mehedin\u021bi County#Historical county|Mehedin\u021bi]] and [[Hunedoara County#Historical county|Hunedoara]], and to the north by [[Arad County#Historical county|Arad County]]. The county had a total area over {{convert|11000|km\u00b2}}, making it the largest county geographically of interwar Romania. Its territory corresponded to the former Hungarian division of [[Krass\u00f3-Sz\u00f6r\u00e9ny County]]. The county existed for seven years, being divided in 1926 into [[Cara\u0219 County]] and [[Severin County]].\n\n===Administration===\nThe county was divided administratively into fourteen districts (''[[plas\u0103|pl\u0103\u1e63i]]''). There were five urban municipalities (cities): [[Lugoj]] (capital), [[Caransebe\u0219]], [[Re\u0219i\u021ba]], [[Oravi\u021ba]] and [[Or\u0219ova]].<ref name=Memoria_Caras>[http://romaniainterbelica.memoria.ro/judete/caras/ Portretul Rom\u00e2niei Interbelice - Jude\u021bul Cara\u0219]</ref><ref name=Memoria_Severin>[http://romaniainterbelica.memoria.ro/judete/severin/ Portretul Rom\u00e2niei Interbelice - Jude\u021bul Severin]</ref>\n\n=== Population ===\nAccording to the census data of 1920, the total population of the county was 424,254 inhabitants.

It is also the county through which the river [[Danube]] enters Romania.\n\nThe mountains make up 67% of the county's surface, including the [[Southern Carpathians]] range, with [[Banat Mountains]], [[\u021aarcu Mountains|\u021aarcu-Godeanu Mountains]] and [[Cernei Mountains]] and elevations between 600 and 2100 meters. Transition hills between mountains and the [[Banat Plain]] lie in the western side of the county.\n\nThe [[Danube]] enters Romania in the vicinity of [[Bazia\u0219]], bordering [[Serbia]]. [[Timi\u0219 (river)|Timi\u0219]], [[Cerna (Danube)|Cerna]], [[Cara\u0219 River|Cara\u0219]] and [[Nera (Danube)|Nera]] cross the county, some of them through spectacular valleys and gorges.\n\n=== Neighbours ===\n{{Romanian counties map}}\n* [[Hunedoara County]] and [[Gorj County]] to the east.\n* [[Timi\u0219 County]] to the north.\n* [[Mehedin\u021bi County]] to the southeast.\n* [[Serbia]] to the southwest:\n** [[Vojvodina]] Autonomous Province to the west \u2013 [[South Banat District|South Banat okrug]].\n** [[Bor District]] and [[Brani\u010devo District]] to the south.\n\n== History and economy ==\nIn 1718 the county was part of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], part of the province of [[Banat of Temeswar|Banat]]. In 1771 the county seat, Reschitz ([[Re\u0219i\u021ba]]) became a modern industrial center under Austrian rule. The area received considerable attention due to its [[mining]] industry. In 1855, the entire Banat area, with its supplies of mineral deposits and timber, was transferred from the Austrian Treasury to a joint Austrian-French mining and railroad company named [[Imperial Austrian State Railways|StEG]]. StEG built the [[Oravi\u021ba]]-[[Bazia\u0219]] line, Romania's oldest railroad track.\n\nAfter World War I, StEG, Banat and most [[Austro-Hungarian Empire|Austro-Hungarian]] property were taken over by a company named UDR. During the last years of World War II, when Romania was an ally of [[Nazi Germany]], a [[Partisan (military)|partisan]] group, led by [[\u0218tefan Plav\u0103\u021b]], was active in the mountainous area of the county.<ref>Covaci, Maria (1969). \"\u0218tefan Plav\u0103\u021b\" in ''Anale de Istorie'', Vol. XV, Nr. 4.

There is a County Museum of History in Re\u0219i\u021ba, displaying archeological artifacts, and, in the town of [[Ocna de Fier]], the [[Constantin Gruiescu]] Mineralogical Collection.

the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] in 1920 under the [[Treaty of Trianon]]. The county was located in the southwestern part of [[Greater Romania]], in the south and east region of the [[Banat]]. The county seat was [[Lugoj]]. Its territory consisted entirely of the current territory of the county, but also parts of the current counties of [[Timi\u0219 County|Timi\u0219]], [[Arad County|Arad]], and [[Mehedin\u021bi County|Mehedin\u021bi]]. It bordered on the west with [[Timi\u0219-Torontal County]] and the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], to the south with Yugoslavia, to the east with the counties [[Mehedin\u021bi County#Historical county|Mehedin\u021bi]] and [[Hunedoara County#Historical county|Hunedoara]], and to the north by [[Arad County#Historical county|Arad County]]. The county had a total area over {{convert|11000|km\u00b2}}, making it the largest county geographically of interwar Romania. Its territory corresponded to the former Hungarian division of [[Krass\u00f3-Sz\u00f6r\u00e9ny County]]. The county existed for seven years, being divided in 1926 into [[Cara\u0219 County]] and [[Severin County]].\n\n===Administration===\nThe county was divided administratively into fourteen districts (''[[plas\u0103|pl\u0103\u1e63i]]''). There were five urban municipalities (cities): [[Lugoj]] (capital), [[Caransebe\u0219]], [[Re\u0219i\u021ba]], [[Oravi\u021ba]] and [[Or\u0219ova]].<ref name=Memoria_Caras>[http://romaniainterbelica.memoria.ro/judete/caras/ Portretul Rom\u00e2niei Interbelice - Jude\u021bul Cara\u0219]</ref><ref name=Memoria_Severin>[http://romaniainterbelica.memoria.ro/judete/severin/ Portretul Rom\u00e2niei Interbelice - Jude\u021bul Severin]</ref>\n\n=== Population ===\nAccording to the census data of 1920, the total population of the county was 424,254 inhabitants.

At the time Croteam was making ''Serious Sam'', licensing other engines was costly (upwards of {{USD|1 million}}), so they made their own from scratch, following the feature set of the [[Doom engine|first ''Doom'' engine]], which simulated 3D spaces in 2D, and did not include up or down targeting. As they were creating their own, both ''[[Duke Nukem 3D]]'' (which added up-and-down freelook) and ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'' (a fully 3D rendered environment) were released, requiring Croteam to incorporate these features into their engine for their game to be competitive. Development was further complicated when the first [[Graphics processing unit|3D accelerators]] were released, forcing Croteam to develop for hardware rendering over software.<ref name=\"Ars Technica\">{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/10/war-stories-serious-sam-almost-didnt-happen-until-crates-saved-the-day/ |title=War Stories: ''Serious Sam'' almost didn't happen\u2014until crates saved the day |first1=Nikola |last1=Mosettig |first2=Lee |last2=Manansala |date=3 October 2018 |website=[[Ars Technica]] |access-date=3 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181003213132/https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/10/war-stories-serious-sam-almost-didnt-happen-until-crates-saved-the-day/ |archive-date=3 October 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> Recognizing they needed to bring something new to what other games were pushing at that time, Croteam decided that they would make their Serious Engine support extremely large environments, with virtual view distances of over a kilometre, physics support, and capable of rendering up to a hundred enemies on screen at a time, and do this on the processing power of what current low-end computers using [[P5 (microarchitecture)|Pentium One]] CPUs could handle.<ref name=\"Ars Technica\" /> The team devised ways of doing object path caching so that they only had to perform [[collision detection]] with environmental features every few seconds rather than every cycle. Collision detection was also sped up by approximating the environment with spheres rather than boxes. This also enabled them to have multidirection gravity which was used for some of the game's secret areas.<ref name=\"Ars Technica\" />\n\nSerious Engine 1 is available as open-source software.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.croteam.com/serious-sam-source-code-released/ |title=Serious Sam's Serious Engine source code released |date=11 March 2016 |website=[[Croteam]] |access-date=12 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312014114/http://www.croteam.com/serious-sam-source-code-released/ |archive-date=12 March 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> A more powerful iteration of the Serious Engine was developed for use in ''[[Serious Sam 2]]'' and is known as Serious Engine 2. It supports many features of modern GPUs such as pixel and vertex shaders, HDR, bloom and parallax mapping. Serious Engine 3 was used in ''[[Serious Sam HD: The First Encounter]]'' and ''[[Serious Sam HD: The Second Encounter]]''. It includes detailed shading, and enemies are re-modelled to look more realistic. This engine is also being developed to harness the full capacity of HDR and high definition mapping.

As they were creating their own, both ''[[Duke Nukem 3D]]'' (which added up-and-down freelook) and ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'' (a fully 3D rendered environment) were released, requiring Croteam to incorporate these features into their engine for their game to be competitive.

In general, peace officers are state civil officers charged with preserving the public peace and granted the authority to do so.  Peace officers normally include police officers, sheriffs and sheriffs' deputies, marshals, constables, and often many other persons; those included vary among the states.\n</ref> to lawfully order people whom they reasonably suspect of a crime to state their name. If there is not [[reasonable suspicion]] that a crime has been committed, is being committed, or is about to be committed, an individual is not required to provide identification, even in these states.<ref>{{ussc|542|177|2004}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] prohibits unreasonable [[Search and seizure|searches and seizures]] and requires [[Warrant (law)|warrants]] to be supported by [[probable cause]]. In ''[[Terry v. Ohio]]'' (1968), the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] established that it is constitutional for police to temporarily detain a person based on an articulable [[reasonable suspicion]] that a crime has been committed, and then to conduct a [[Frisking|patdown]] for weapons based on a reasonable belief that the person is armed. Then in ''[[Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial District Court of Nevada]]'' (2004), the Supreme Court held that statutes requiring suspects to disclose their names during a valid ''Terry'' stop did not violate the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]].<ref name=\"hiibel\">\nWriting for the Court in ''Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial District Court of Nevada'', [[Anthony Kennedy|Justice Kennedy]] stated,\n\n: Here the Nevada statute is narrower and more precise.  The statute in ''Kolender'' had been interpreted to require a suspect to give the officer \"credible and reliable\" identification. In contrast, the Nevada Supreme Court has interpreted NRS \u00a7171.123(3) to require only that a suspect disclose his name. {{nowrap|\u2014 542 U.S. 177, 184\u2013185}}\nJustice Kennedy continued,\n\n: As we understand it, the statute does not require a suspect to give the officer a drivers license or any other document. Provided that the suspect either states his name or communicates it to the officer by other means\u2014a choice, we assume, that the suspect may make\u2014the statute is satisfied and no violation occurs. {{nowrap|\u2014 542 U.S. at 185}}\nWriting for the Nevada Supreme Court in ''Hiibel v. Dist. Ct.'', Chief Justice Young said,\n\n: The suspect is not required to provide private details about his background, but merely to state his name to an officer when reasonable suspicion exists. {{nowrap|\u2014 118 Nev. 868 at 875}}\n</ref> \n\nHowever, some \"stop and identify\" statutes that are unclear about how people must identify themselves violate suspects\u2019 [[due process]] through the [[Vagueness doctrine|void for vagueness]] doctrine. For instance, in [[Kolender v. Lawson]] (1983), the Court invalidated a [[California]] law requiring \"credible and reliable\" identification as overly [[Vagueness doctrine|vague]].<ref name=\"Kolender\">{{ussc|461|352||name=}}</ref> The court also held that the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] could allow a suspect to refuse to give his name if he has a reasonable belief that giving his name could be incriminating.<ref>\nIn upholding Hiibel's conviction, the Court noted,\n\n: In this case petitioner's refusal to disclose his name was not based on any articulated real and appreciable fear that his name would be used to incriminate him.... As best we can tell, petitioner refused to identify himself only because he thought his name was none of the officer's business. {{nowrap|\u2014 542 U.S. at 190}}\nBut the Court did leave open the possibility of different circumstances:\n\n: Still, a case may arise where there is a substantial allegation that furnishing identity at the time of a stop would have given the police a link in the chain of evidence needed to convict the individual of a separate offense. In that case, the court can then consider whether the privilege applies, and, if the Fifth Amendment has been violated, what remedy must follow. We need not resolve those questions here. {{nowrap|\u2014 542 U.S. at 191}}\n</ref>\n\nThe Nevada \"[[Stop and Identify statutes|stop-and-identify]]\" law at issue in ''Hiibel'' allows [[police officer]]s to detain any person they encounter under circumstances which reasonably indicate that \"the person has committed, is committing or is about to commit a crime\"; the person may be detained only to \"ascertain his identity and the suspicious circumstances surrounding his presence abroad.\" In turn, the law requires the officer to have reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal involvement, and that the person detained to \"identify himself\", but does not compel the person to answer any other questions put to him by the officer. The Nevada Supreme Court interpreted \"identify\" under the state\u2019s law to mean merely stating one\u2019s name. As of April 2008, 23 other states<ref>\nSee the article Stop and identify statutes for a list of states with \"stop-and-identify\" laws.\n</ref> have similar laws.\n\n== Police\u2013citizen encounters ==\n\nIn the United States, interactions between [[police]] and citizens fall into three general categories: consensual (\"contact\" or \"conversation\"), detention (often called a [[Terry stop|''Terry'' stop]], after ''[[Terry v. Ohio]]'', {{ussc|392|1|1968}}), or [[arrest]]. \"Stop and identify\" laws pertain to detentions.\n\nDifferent obligations apply to drivers of motor vehicles, who generally are required by state vehicle codes to present a driver's license to police upon request, but only after an officer identifies themself and their department and give all reasons why a stop is necessary.\nNo driver in the US is obligated to ID without this articulation.\n\n=== Consensual ===\n\nAt any time, police may approach a person and ask questions. The objective may simply be a friendly conversation; however, the police also may suspect involvement in a crime, but lack \"specific and articulable facts\"<ref>\nWriting for the Court in ''Terry v. Ohio'', [[Earl Warren|Chief Justice Warren]] stated,\n:And in justifying the particular intrusion the police officer must be able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant that intrusion. {{nowrap|\u2014 392 U.S. at 21}}\n</ref>\nthat would justify a detention or arrest, and hope to obtain these facts from the questioning. The person approached is not required to identify himself or herself or answer any other questions, and may leave at any time.<ref>\nWriting for the Court in ''Florida v. Royer'' {{ussc|460|491|1983}}, [[Byron White|Justice White]] stated,\n:The person approached, however, need not answer any question put to him; indeed, he may decline to listen to the questions at all and may go on his way. {{nowrap|\u2014 460 U.S. at 497\u2013498}}\n</ref>\nPolice are not required to tell a person that he or she is free to decline to answer questions and go about her business;<ref>\nWriting for the Court in ''United States v. Mendenhall'', {{ussc|446|544|1980}} [[Potter Stewart|Justice Stewart]] stated,\n:Our conclusion that no seizure occurred is not affected by the fact that the respondent was not expressly told by the agents that she was free to decline to cooperate with their inquiry, for the voluntariness of her responses does not depend upon her having been so informed. {{nowrap|\u2014 446 U.S. at 555}}\n</ref>\nhowever, a person can usually determine whether the interaction is consensual by asking, \"Am I free to go?\"<ref>\nThe [[ACLU]] publication ''Know Your Rights When Encountering Law Enforcement'' states,\n:You can say, \"I do not want to talk to you\" and walk away calmly. Or, if you do not feel comfortable doing that, you can ask if you are free to go. If the answer is yes, you can consider just walking away. Do not run from the officer. If the officer says you are not under arrest, but you are not free to go, then you are being detained.\n</ref><ref>\nIf the encounter is consensual, a person approached need not actually leave to terminate the encounter, but may simply ignore police. In ''Michigan v. Chesternut'', {{ussc|486|567|1988}}, [[Harry Blackmun|Justice Blackmun]] explained the Court's holding that Chesternut had not been detained, stating that the police conduct \"would not have communicated to a reasonable person that he was not at liberty to ignore the police presence and go about his business.\" {{nowrap|\u2014 486 U.S. at 569}}\n</ref>\n\n=== Reasonable suspicion ===\n\nA person is detained when circumstances are such that a reasonable person would believe he is not free to leave.<ref>\nWriting for the Court in ''United States v. Mendenhall'', {{ussc|446|544|1980}} [[Potter Stewart|Justice Stewart]] stated:\n:We conclude that a person has been \"seized\" within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment only if, in view of all of the circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave. {{nowrap|\u2014 446 U.S. at 554}}\n</ref>\n\nPolice may briefly detain a person if they have [[reasonable suspicion]] that the person has committed, is committing, or is about to commit a crime.  Many state laws explicitly grant this authority. In ''Terry v. Ohio'', the U.S. Supreme Court established that police may conduct a limited search for weapons (known as a \"[[frisking|frisk]]\") if they reasonably suspect that the person to be detained may be armed and dangerous.\n\nPolice may question a person detained in a [[Terry stop]], but in general, the detainee is not required to answer.<ref>\nIn a concurring opinion in ''Terry v. Ohio'', [[Byron White|Justice White]] stated that a person detained can be questioned but is \"not obliged to answer, answers may not be compelled, and refusal to answer furnishes no basis for an arrest.\" This opinion, in turn, was cited in many later cases, including ''Berkemer v. McCarty'', {{ussc|468|420|1984}}.\n</ref>\nHowever, many states have \"stop and identify\" laws that explicitly require a person detained under the conditions of ''Terry'' to identify himself to police, and in some cases, provide additional information.\n\nBefore ''[[Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial District Court of Nevada|Hiibel]]'', it was unresolved whether a detainee could be arrested and prosecuted for refusing to disclose his name. Authority on this issue was split among the federal circuit courts of appeal,<ref>\nIn describing the split authority among the federal appellate court circuits in [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=nv&vol=118NevAdvOpNo88&invol=2 ''Hiibel v. Dist. Ct.''], the Nevada Supreme Court stated:\n:In ''Oliver v. Woods'', <nowiki>[209 F.3d 1179, 1190 (10th Cir. 2000)]</nowiki> the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a Utah statute that requires individuals to produce identification to an officer during an investigatory stop.  However, in ''Carey v. Nevada Gaming Control Board'' <nowiki>[279 F.3d 873, 881 (9th Cir. 2002)]</nowiki>, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that NRS 171.123(3) violates the Fourth Amendment because \"&nbsp;'the serious intrusion on personal security outweighs the mere possibility that identification [might] provide a link leading to arrest.'&nbsp;\"\n</ref>\nand the U.S. Supreme Court twice expressly refused to address the question.<ref>\nIn ''Hiibel v. Dist. Ct.'', the Nevada Supreme Court noted that the U.S. Supreme Court declined to address the issue of identification in\n''[[Brown v. Texas]]'',  {{ussc|443|47|1979}}, at 53 n.3 (\"We need not decide whether an individual may be punished for refusing to identify himself in the context of a lawful investigatory stop which satisfies Fourth Amendment requirements.\"); and ''[[Kolender v. Lawson]]'', {{ussc|461|352|1983}}, 361&ndash;62 n.10 (holding that a California statute was unconstitutional on vagueness grounds, but refusing to consider whether the statute violated the Fourth Amendment).\n</ref>\nIn '' Hiibel'', the Court opinion implied that a detainee was '''not''' required to produce written identification, but could satisfy the requirement merely by stating his name. Some \"stop and identify\" laws do not require that a detainee identify himself, but allow refusal to do so to be considered along with other factors in determining whether there is probable cause to arrest.<ref>\n<!-- referenced by note in Arrest, below -->\nTexas does not require a detainee to identify himself unless he has been lawfully arrested, but does make it a crime to provide a false name. Texas Penal Code [http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/PE/htm/PE.38.htm#38.02 \u00a7&nbsp;38.02] reads, in relevant part,\n:(b)  A person commits an offense if he intentionally gives a false or fictitious name, residence address, or date of birth to a peace officer who has:\n::(1)  lawfully arrested the person;\n::(2)  lawfully detained the person;  or\n::(3)  requested the information from a person that the peace officer has good cause to believe is a witness to a criminal offense.\n</ref>\n\nAs of February 2011, the Supreme Court has not addressed the validity of requirements that a detainee provide information other than his name, however some states such as Arizona have specifically codified that a detained person is not required to provide any information aside from their full name.\n\n=== Arrest ===\n{{Main|Arrest}}\n\nA [[Remand (detention)|detention]] requires only that police have [[reasonable suspicion]] that a person is involved in [[criminal activity]]. However, to make an arrest, an officer must have [[probable cause]] to believe that the person has committed a crime. Some states require police to inform the person of the intent to make the arrest and the cause for the arrest.<ref>\nCalifornia Penal Code \u00a7 841, states, in relevant part,\n:The person making the arrest must inform the person to be arrested of the intention to arrest him, of the cause of the arrest, and the authority to make it .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.\n</ref>\nBut it is not always obvious when a detention becomes an arrest. After making an arrest, police may search a person, his or her belongings, and his or her immediate surroundings.\n\nWhether an arrested person must identify himself may depend on the [[jurisdiction]] in which the arrest occurs. If a person is under arrest and police wish to question him, they are required to inform the person of his [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth-Amendment]] right to remain silent by giving a [[Miranda warning]]. However, ''Miranda'' does not apply to biographical data necessary to complete booking.<ref>\nIn ''Pennsylvania v.

We, nevertheless, conclude that after an individual has been lawfully arrested, he must provide his name or otherwise identify himself when asked by law enforcement officers.\n</ref>\nhave held that refusal to give one's name constitutes obstructing a public officer.

Some states listed have \"Stop and ID\" laws which may or may not require someone to identify themselves during an investigative detention.\n\nWhile Wisconsin statutes allow law enforcement officers to \"demand\" ID, there is no statutory requirement to provide them ID nor is there a penalty for refusing to, hence Wisconsin is not a must ID state. ''[https://www.leagle.com/decision/1995532194wis2d3381517 Henes v. Morrissey]'', 194 Wis.2d 338, 353-54 (1995).  Annotations for Wisconsin \u00a7968.24, however, state \"The principles of ''Terry'' permit a state to require a suspect to disclose his or her name in the course of a ''Terry'' stop and allow imposing criminal penalties for failing to do so\", citing ''[[Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial District Court of Nevada|Hiibel]]'' as authority.\nHiibel held that statutes requiring suspects to disclose their names during police investigations did not violate the Fourth Amendment if the statute first required reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal involvement. The Wisconsin Supreme Court held in Henes v. Morrissey that \"A crime is made up of two parts: proscribed conduct and a prescribed penalty. \"The former without the latter is no crime. ...  In this case no statute penalizes a refusal to identify oneself to a law enforcement officer, and no penalty is set forth in the statute for refusing to identify oneself. This statute is part of Chapter 968 entitled \"Commencement of Criminal Proceedings. By its very terms sec. 968.24 empowers a law enforcement officer to stop and question \"in the vicinity where the person was stopped.\" The statute does not authorize a law enforcement officer to make an arrest.\"(These quotes comes from the dissenting opinion but is in line with the majority opinion.) Additionally Henes v. Morrissey held that a detained person not providing their name isn't on its own a violation of 946.41 Resisting or obstructing officer as the act of not identifying one's self\nisn't a false statement with intent to mislead the officer in the performance of his or her duty.\n\nNeither is Illinois, since the Illinois Second District Appellate Court Decision in ''People v. Fernandez'', 2011 IL App (2d) 100473, which specifically states that section 107-14 is found in the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963, not the Criminal Code of 1961, and governs the conduct of police officers. The fact remains that there is no corresponding duty in the Criminal Code of 1961 for a suspect to identify himself\nor herself.<ref>http://www.illinoiscourts.gov/opinions/AppellateCourt/2011/2ndDistrict/December/2100473.pdf</ref>\n\nAs of February 2011, there is no U.S. federal law requiring that an individual identify himself during a ''Terry'' stop, but ''Hiibel'' held that states may enact such laws, provided the law requires the officer to have reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal involvement,<ref>\nThe ''Hiibel'' Court held, \"The principles of ''Terry'' permit a State to require a suspect to disclose his name in the course of a ''Terry'' stop.\" {{nowrap|\u2014 542 U.S. at 187}}</ref> and 24 states have done so.<ref>The opinion in ''Hiibel'' included a list of 21 states with \"stop and identify\" laws.\nFor some reason, the Indiana law was not included in the list; the Arizona and Ohio laws have been enacted since ''Hiibel'' was decided.

See ''Hiibel''.</ref> \"stop and identify\" laws listed are obligated to identify themselves,<ref>Writing for the Court in ''Hiibel'', Justice Kennedy stated, \"the source of the legal obligation [to identify oneself] arises from Nevada state law\". {{nowrap|\u2014 542 U.S. at 187}}</ref> and that persons detained in other jurisdictions are not.<ref>In ''Hiibel'', Justice Kennedy stated, \"In other States, a suspect may decline to identify himself without penalty.\u2033 {{nowrap|\u2014 542 U.S.  at 183}}</ref>\nThe issue may not be that simple, however, for several reasons:\n* The wording of \"stop and identify\" laws varies considerably from state to state.\n* Noncompliance with a \"stop and identify\" law that does not explicitly impose a penalty may constitute violation of another law, such as one to the effect of \"resisting, obstructing, or delaying a peace officer\".\n* State courts have made varying interpretations of both \"stop and identify\" and \"obstructing\" laws.\n\n=== Variations in \"stop and identify\" laws ===\n\n* Four states' laws (Arizona, Indiana, Louisiana, and Nevada) explicitly impose an obligation to provide identifying information.\n* Fifteen states grant police authority to ask questions, with varying wording, but do not explicitly impose an obligation to respond:\n\n:* In Montana, police \"may request\" identifying information;\n:* In Ohio, identifying information may be required \"when requested\"; an obligation exists only when the police suspect a person is committing, has committed, or is about to commit a criminal offense, is witness to a violent felony offense, or is witness to an attempt or conspiracy to commit a violent felony offense;\n:* In 12 states (Alabama, Delaware, Illinois, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New York, North Dakota, Rhode Island, Utah, Wisconsin), police \"may demand\" identifying information. Of note, though, in New Hampshire for example (RSA 594:2), statutory language authorizing a 'demand' for identity does not establish a legal requirement to provide documentation of identity (ID), or even a requirement to respond in the first place. Further, a law enforcement officer is authorized to make such 'demand' only of individuals for \"whom he has reason to suspect is committing, has committed or is about to commit a crime.\"\n\n* Identifying information varies, but typically includes\n:* Name, address, and an explanation of the person's actions;\n:* In some cases it also includes the person's intended destination, the person's date of birth (Indiana and Ohio), or written identification if available (Colorado). Ohio does not require the person's intended destination. Ohio requires only name, address, or date of birth. Date of birth is NOT required if the age of the person is an element to the crime (such as underage drinking, curfew violation, etc...) that the person is reasonably suspected of.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/2921.29|title=Lawriter - ORC - 2921.29 Failure to disclose personal information.|publisher=State of Ohio Codes}}</ref> Indiana requires either name, address, and date of birth, or driver's license, if on the person's possession, and only applies if the person was stopped for an infraction or ordinance violation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://iga.in.gov/legislative/laws/2016/ic/titles/034/articles/028/chapters/005/#section-3.5|title=Indiana Code 2016 - Indiana General Assembly, 2016 Session|first=Indiana General|last=Assembly|publisher=}}</ref>\n:* Arizona law, apparently written specifically to codify the holding in ''Hiibel'', requires a person's \"true full name\".\n:* Nevada law, which requires a person to \"identify himself or herself\", apparently requires only that the person state his or her name.\n:* Texas law requires a person to provide their name, residence address and date of birth if lawfully arrested and asked by police. (A detained person or witness of a crime is required to provide any identifying information, however it is a crime for a detained person or witness to give a false name.) Texas P.C. 38.02\n* In four states (Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, and Rhode Island), failure to identify oneself is one factor to be considered in a decision to arrest.  In all but Rhode Island, the consideration arises in the context of [[loitering]] or prowling. \n* Seven states (Arizona, Florida, Indiana, Louisiana, New Mexico, Ohio, and Vermont) explicitly impose a criminal penalty for noncompliance with the obligation to identify oneself.\n\nAs of February 2011, the validity of a law requiring that a person detained provide anything more than stating his or her name has not come before the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n=== Interaction with other laws ===\n\nIn states whose \"stop and identify laws\" do not directly impose penalties, a lawful arrest must be for violation of some other law, such as one to the effect of \"resisting, obstructing, or delaying a peace officer\".\nFor example, the Nevada \"stop and identify\" law challenged in ''Hiibel'' did not impose a penalty on a person who refused to comply, but the Justice Court of Union Township, Nevada, determined that Hiibels refusal to identify himself<ref>\nThe opinion noted that Hiibel was asked to provide identification, which the Court understood as a request to produce a driver's license or some other form of written identification, 11 different times; however, it did not indicate that Hiibel was ever asked simply to identify himself.\n</ref>\nconstituted a violation of Nevada \"obstructing\" law.<ref>\nNRS \u00a7199.280 provides a penalty for a person who \"willfully resists, delays or obstructs a public officer in discharging or attempting to discharge any legal duty of his office\"\n</ref>\nA similar conclusion regarding the interaction between Utah \"stop and identify\" and \"obstructing\" laws was reached in ''Oliver v. Woods'' (10th Cir. 2000).\n\n=== Interpretation by courts ===\n\n\"Stop and identify\" laws in different states that appear to be nearly identical may be different in effect because of interpretations by state courts. For example, California \"stop and identify\" law, Penal Code \u00a7647(e) had wording<ref>California stop-and-identify law in Penal Code \u00a7647(e) was repealed several years after 1983 and the sub-sections re-lettered, so the current Penal Code \u00a7647(e) is what used to be Penal Code \u00a7647(f). Also, do not confuse Penal Code \u00a7647(e) with Penal Code \u00a7647e.</ref><ref>(voided in ''Kolender v.

Using this construction, the U.S. Supreme Court held the law to be void for vagueness in ''[[Kolender v.

As such, the statute vests virtually complete discretion in the hands of the police to determine whether the suspect has satisfied the statute. {{nowrap|\u2014 461 U.S. at 358}}\n</ref>\n\nSome courts have recognized a distinction authorizing police to demand identifying information and specifically imposing an obligation of a suspect to respond.<ref>\nWriting for the Court in ''People v. Love'', 318 Ill.App.3d 534 (2000), rev'd on other grounds, ''People v. Love'', No. 90806 (2002), Justice O'Brien stated,\n:The State next argues that the officer's order was a justifiable means of compelling defendant to state her name pursuant to section 107-14, which provides that an officer making a ''Terry'' stop may \"demand the name and address of the person and an explanation of his actions.\" 725 ILCS 5/107-14 (West 1992). However, while section 107-14 states that an officer may \"demand\" the defendant's name, it does not provide that the officer may compel a response. Further, the United States Supreme Court has stated in the context of a ''Terry'' stop: \"[T]he officer may ask the detainee a moderate number of questions to determine his identity and to try to obtain information confirming or dispelling the officer's suspicions. ''But the detainee is not obliged to respond''.\" (Emphasis added.) ''Berkemer v. McCarty'', 468 U.S. 420, 438, 82 L. Ed. 2d 317, 334, 104 S. Ct. 3138, 3150 (1984).\nNoting ''Berkemer v. McCarty'' (and Justice White's concurring opinion in ''Terry'' that ''Berkemer'' quoted), the ''Hiibel'' Court stated, \"We do not read these statements as controlling\" (542 U.S. at 187), so ''Love'' is probably weakened to the extent that it relies on ''Berkemer''.\n</ref>\nOther courts have apparently interpreted ''demand'' to impose an obligation on the detainee to comply.<ref>\nIn ''Cady v. Sheahan'' (7th Cir. 2006), the Court stated,\n:In ''Hiibel'', the Supreme Court held that states are permitted to statutorily authorize the demand for identification during a ''Terry'' stop, and to require compliance with such demand. 542 U.S. at 188, 124 S.Ct. 2451. Cady's identity was relevant to the purpose of the stop and the officers did not exceed the scope of the stop by requesting identification.

Thus, Officer Woods gave a lawful order when he told Mr. Oliver to present identification and to remain in the parking lot while he conducted the investigation.

For example, as the U.S. Supreme Court noted in ''Hiibel'', California \"stop and identify\" statute was voided in ''Kolender v. Lawson''. But in ''People v. Long'',<ref>\nIn ''People v. Long'' (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 77, Justice Agliano wrote,\n:The voluntary display of identification is a routine experience for most of us. Measured against the obvious and substantial need for police recording the identity of a person suspected of having committed a crime, we find reasonable the minimal intrusion involved here in requiring the production of identification. In addition, defendant's oral statement of his name was suspect when he insisted he had no identification while appearing to carry a wallet and, in addition, he seemed intoxicated. {{nowrap|\u2014 189 Cal.App.3d at 88}}\n</ref>\ndecided four years after ''Kolender'', a California appellate court found no constitutional impropriety in a police officer's demand for written identification from a detainee whom they reasonably suspect of having committed a crime. The issue before the ''Long'' court was a request for suppression of evidence uncovered in a search of the defendant's wallet, so the issue of refusal to present identification was not directly addressed; however, the author of the ''Long'' opinion had apparently concluded in a 1980 case that failure to identify oneself did not provide a basis for arrest.<ref>\nIn ''In re Gregory S.'' (1980), 112 Cal.App.3d 764, Justice Agliano wrote\n:We find no authority to support the court's legal conclusion that a person who merely refuses to identify himself or to answer questions in a context similar to that before us thereby violates Penal Code section 148 or otherwise furnishes ground for arrest.\n\n:The Legislature has required citizen self-identification in prescribed situations. Vehicle Code section 40302 calls for the production of a driver's license or identification upon arrest for a violation of that code; Vehicle Code section 12951 requires production of a driver's license by the driver of a motor vehicle upon the request of an officer. Penal Code section 647, subdivision (e) imposes a duty to identify oneself when such person loiters or wanders upon the streets or from place to place without apparent reason or business, and the surrounding circumstances reasonably indicate that the public safety demands identification. Section 647, subdivision (e) was held valid in ''People v. Solomon'' (1973) 33 Cal.App.3d 429 [108 Cal.Rptr. 867], in which strong consideration was given to the legislatively declared governmental purpose to be served by identification when the conditions described in the statute exist. (Id, at p. 436; see also ''California v. Byers'' (1971) 402 U.S. 424 [29 L.Ed.2d 9, 91 S.Ct. 1535].)

[[Bruce F. Beilfuss|Chief Justice Beilfuss]] wrote,\n:It is clear from the language itself that the court's holding in ''Terry'' was limited to the precise situation before it.

The situation before us is significantly different.\n</ref>\nand ''People v. Loudermilk'' (Calif. 1987)<ref>\nIn ''People v. Loudermilk'' (1987) 195 Cal.App.3d 996, Justice Low stated,\n:Neither case [''Kolender v. Lawson'' or ''Brown v.

Nor do we hold that each time an officer conducts a Terry stop he may immediately conduct a search for identification. The rule we announce does not provide officers with unfettered discretion and does not open citizens to harassment. {{nowrap|\u2014 195 Cal.App.3d at 1004}}\n</ref>\nhave held that police may perform a search for written identification if a suspect refuses to provide it;\na later California decision, ''People v.

In fact, it would require a rewriting of ''Terry v. Ohio'', ''supra,'' which we could not and would not undertake even if we were so inclined. Here, the record is devoid of any concern that appellant was armed and dangerous. The sole reason for the patdown was to gather evidence of identification.\n:A fair reading of ''Terry v. Ohio'', and its reference to the lower court opinion in ''State v. Terry'' show that the \"frisk\" allowable upon a proper showing was \"&nbsp;'.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. only a \"frisk\" for a dangerous weapon. It by no means authorizes a search for contraband, evidentiary material, or anything else in the absence of reasonable grounds to arrest. Such a search is controlled by requirements of the Fourth Amendment, and probable cause is essential.'&nbsp;\" (''Terry v. Ohio'', ''supra'', 392 U.S. at p. 16, fn. 12 [20 L.

If ''stare decisis'' means anything (and it does) and if the word ''only'' means ''only'' (and it does), the trial court was required to grant this suppression motion as a matter of law.

Strieff]]'' (2016), the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that an officer's stop of Edward Strieff and his demand for identification from Strieff was unlawful under Utah state law, but that the evidence collected pursuant to the stop was admissible due to the determination that Strieff was subject to a pre-existing arrest warrant. Therefore, the pre-existing warrant \"attenuated\" the unlawful stop-and-identify.\n\n=== Recommendations of legal-aid organizations ===\n\nSome legal organizations, such as the [[National Lawyers Guild]] and the [[ACLU]] of Northern California,\nrecommend to either remain silent or to identify oneself whether or not a jurisdiction has a \"stop and identify\" law:\n:And in any state, police do not always follow the law, and refusing to give your name may make them suspicious and lead to your arrest, so use your judgment. If you fear that your name may be incriminating, you can claim the right to remain silent, and if you are arrested, this may help you later.

Normally these countries provide all residents with [[Identity document|national identity cards]], which have the identity information the police would want to know, including citizenship. Foreign visitors need to have their passport available to show at all times. In some cases national identity cards from certain other countries are accepted.\n\nFor example, in [[Portugal]] it is compulsory to carry the state ID card at all times. This card named [[Cart\u00e3o de Cidad\u00e3o]] - Citizen Card is an electronic card which includes biometric information, id number, social security number, fiscal information etc. Police can only ask for the ID card in public or a place open to public and only if there is a reasonable suspicion the person committed a crime. A certified copy of the ID card can be presented in such situations. If a citizen does not carry the ID card or its certified copy, the police will escort the person to the police department to remain detained until clear identification can be obtained.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.direitosedeveres.pt/q/vida-pessoal-e-familiar/identidade/um-cidadao-traz-habitualmente-consigo-apenas-uma-fotocopia-do-cartao-de-cidadao-ou-do-bilhete-de-identidade-se-a-|title=Um cidad\u00e3o traz habitualmente consigo apenas uma fotoc\u00f3pia do cart\u00e3o de cidad\u00e3o ou do bilhete de identidade.

Police may also require people to identify themselves if they have reasonable grounds to believe that they have committed a crime.<ref>http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2008/0072/latest/whole.html#DLM1351201</ref><ref>http://svan.ca/police-rights/</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* ''[[Brown v.

If there is not [[reasonable suspicion]] that a crime has been committed, is being committed, or is about to be committed, an individual is not required to provide identification, even in these states.<ref>{{ussc|542|177|2004}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] prohibits unreasonable [[Search and seizure|searches and seizures]] and requires [[Warrant (law)|warrants]] to be supported by [[probable cause]]. In ''[[Terry v. Ohio]]'' (1968), the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] established that it is constitutional for police to temporarily detain a person based on an articulable [[reasonable suspicion]] that a crime has been committed, and then to conduct a [[Frisking|patdown]] for weapons based on a reasonable belief that the person is armed. Then in ''[[Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial District Court of Nevada]]'' (2004), the Supreme Court held that statutes requiring suspects to disclose their names during a valid ''Terry'' stop did not violate the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]].<ref name=\"hiibel\">\nWriting for the Court in ''Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial District Court of Nevada'', [[Anthony Kennedy|Justice Kennedy]] stated,\n\n: Here the Nevada statute is narrower and more precise.  The statute in ''Kolender'' had been interpreted to require a suspect to give the officer \"credible and reliable\" identification. In contrast, the Nevada Supreme Court has interpreted NRS \u00a7171.123(3) to require only that a suspect disclose his name. {{nowrap|\u2014 542 U.S. 177, 184\u2013185}}\nJustice Kennedy continued,\n\n: As we understand it, the statute does not require a suspect to give the officer a drivers license or any other document. Provided that the suspect either states his name or communicates it to the officer by other means\u2014a choice, we assume, that the suspect may make\u2014the statute is satisfied and no violation occurs. {{nowrap|\u2014 542 U.S. at 185}}\nWriting for the Nevada Supreme Court in ''Hiibel v.

For instance, in [[Kolender v. Lawson]] (1983), the Court invalidated a [[California]] law requiring \"credible and reliable\" identification as overly [[Vagueness doctrine|vague]].<ref name=\"Kolender\">{{ussc|461|352||name=}}</ref> The court also held that the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] could allow a suspect to refuse to give his name if he has a reasonable belief that giving his name could be incriminating.<ref>\nIn upholding Hiibel's conviction, the Court noted,\n\n: In this case petitioner's refusal to disclose his name was not based on any articulated real and appreciable fear that his name would be used to incriminate him.... As best we can tell, petitioner refused to identify himself only because he thought his name was none of the officer's business. {{nowrap|\u2014 542 U.S. at 190}}\nBut the Court did leave open the possibility of different circumstances:\n\n: Still, a case may arise where there is a substantial allegation that furnishing identity at the time of a stop would have given the police a link in the chain of evidence needed to convict the individual of a separate offense. In that case, the court can then consider whether the privilege applies, and, if the Fifth Amendment has been violated, what remedy must follow. We need not resolve those questions here. {{nowrap|\u2014 542 U.S. at 191}}\n</ref>\n\nThe Nevada \"[[Stop and Identify statutes|stop-and-identify]]\" law at issue in ''Hiibel'' allows [[police officer]]s to detain any person they encounter under circumstances which reasonably indicate that \"the person has committed, is committing or is about to commit a crime\"; the person may be detained only to \"ascertain his identity and the suspicious circumstances surrounding his presence abroad.\" In turn, the law requires the officer to have reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal involvement, and that the person detained to \"identify himself\", but does not compel the person to answer any other questions put to him by the officer. The Nevada Supreme Court interpreted \"identify\" under the state\u2019s law to mean merely stating one\u2019s name. As of April 2008, 23 other states<ref>\nSee the article Stop and identify statutes for a list of states with \"stop-and-identify\" laws.\n</ref> have similar laws.\n\n== Police\u2013citizen encounters ==\n\nIn the United States, interactions between [[police]] and citizens fall into three general categories: consensual (\"contact\" or \"conversation\"), detention (often called a [[Terry stop|''Terry'' stop]], after ''[[Terry v. Ohio]]'', {{ussc|392|1|1968}}), or [[arrest]]. \"Stop and identify\" laws pertain to detentions.\n\nDifferent obligations apply to drivers of motor vehicles, who generally are required by state vehicle codes to present a driver's license to police upon request, but only after an officer identifies themself and their department and give all reasons why a stop is necessary.\nNo driver in the US is obligated to ID without this articulation.\n\n=== Consensual ===\n\nAt any time, police may approach a person and ask questions. The objective may simply be a friendly conversation; however, the police also may suspect involvement in a crime, but lack \"specific and articulable facts\"<ref>\nWriting for the Court in ''Terry v. Ohio'', [[Earl Warren|Chief Justice Warren]] stated,\n:And in justifying the particular intrusion the police officer must be able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant that intrusion. {{nowrap|\u2014 392 U.S. at 21}}\n</ref>\nthat would justify a detention or arrest, and hope to obtain these facts from the questioning. The person approached is not required to identify himself or herself or answer any other questions, and may leave at any time.<ref>\nWriting for the Court in ''Florida v. Royer'' {{ussc|460|491|1983}}, [[Byron White|Justice White]] stated,\n:The person approached, however, need not answer any question put to him; indeed, he may decline to listen to the questions at all and may go on his way. {{nowrap|\u2014 460 U.S. at 497\u2013498}}\n</ref>\nPolice are not required to tell a person that he or she is free to decline to answer questions and go about her business;<ref>\nWriting for the Court in ''United States v. Mendenhall'', {{ussc|446|544|1980}} [[Potter Stewart|Justice Stewart]] stated,\n:Our conclusion that no seizure occurred is not affected by the fact that the respondent was not expressly told by the agents that she was free to decline to cooperate with their inquiry, for the voluntariness of her responses does not depend upon her having been so informed. {{nowrap|\u2014 446 U.S. at 555}}\n</ref>\nhowever, a person can usually determine whether the interaction is consensual by asking, \"Am I free to go?\"<ref>\nThe [[ACLU]] publication ''Know Your Rights When Encountering Law Enforcement'' states,\n:You can say, \"I do not want to talk to you\" and walk away calmly. Or, if you do not feel comfortable doing that, you can ask if you are free to go. If the answer is yes, you can consider just walking away. Do not run from the officer. If the officer says you are not under arrest, but you are not free to go, then you are being detained.\n</ref><ref>\nIf the encounter is consensual, a person approached need not actually leave to terminate the encounter, but may simply ignore police. In ''Michigan v. Chesternut'', {{ussc|486|567|1988}}, [[Harry Blackmun|Justice Blackmun]] explained the Court's holding that Chesternut had not been detained, stating that the police conduct \"would not have communicated to a reasonable person that he was not at liberty to ignore the police presence and go about his business.\" {{nowrap|\u2014 486 U.S. at 569}}\n</ref>\n\n=== Reasonable suspicion ===\n\nA person is detained when circumstances are such that a reasonable person would believe he is not free to leave.<ref>\nWriting for the Court in ''United States v. Mendenhall'', {{ussc|446|544|1980}} [[Potter Stewart|Justice Stewart]] stated:\n:We conclude that a person has been \"seized\" within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment only if, in view of all of the circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave. {{nowrap|\u2014 446 U.S. at 554}}\n</ref>\n\nPolice may briefly detain a person if they have [[reasonable suspicion]] that the person has committed, is committing, or is about to commit a crime.  Many state laws explicitly grant this authority. In ''Terry v. Ohio'', the U.S. Supreme Court established that police may conduct a limited search for weapons (known as a \"[[frisking|frisk]]\") if they reasonably suspect that the person to be detained may be armed and dangerous.\n\nPolice may question a person detained in a [[Terry stop]], but in general, the detainee is not required to answer.<ref>\nIn a concurring opinion in ''Terry v. Ohio'', [[Byron White|Justice White]] stated that a person detained can be questioned but is \"not obliged to answer, answers may not be compelled, and refusal to answer furnishes no basis for an arrest.\" This opinion, in turn, was cited in many later cases, including ''Berkemer v. McCarty'', {{ussc|468|420|1984}}.\n</ref>\nHowever, many states have \"stop and identify\" laws that explicitly require a person detained under the conditions of ''Terry'' to identify himself to police, and in some cases, provide additional information.\n\nBefore ''[[Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial District Court of Nevada|Hiibel]]'', it was unresolved whether a detainee could be arrested and prosecuted for refusing to disclose his name. Authority on this issue was split among the federal circuit courts of appeal,<ref>\nIn describing the split authority among the federal appellate court circuits in [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=nv&vol=118NevAdvOpNo88&invol=2 ''Hiibel v.

However, to make an arrest, an officer must have [[probable cause]] to believe that the person has committed a crime. Some states require police to inform the person of the intent to make the arrest and the cause for the arrest.<ref>\nCalifornia Penal Code \u00a7 841, states, in relevant part,\n:The person making the arrest must inform the person to be arrested of the intention to arrest him, of the cause of the arrest, and the authority to make it .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.\n</ref>\nBut it is not always obvious when a detention becomes an arrest.

State'' (Fla. 2d DCA 1998), Case No. 97-00552, the Court, in affirming the appellant's conviction for violation of \u00a7 843.02, Florida Statutes, \"Resisting officer without violence to his or her person\", stated:\n\n: The most compelling argument we discern for answering this question in the affirmative is that the right to remain silent means just that and has no exceptions. We, nevertheless, conclude that after an individual has been lawfully arrested, he must provide his name or otherwise identify himself when asked by law enforcement officers.\n</ref>\nhave held that refusal to give one's name constitutes obstructing a public officer.

Some states listed have \"Stop and ID\" laws which may or may not require someone to identify themselves during an investigative detention.\n\nWhile Wisconsin statutes allow law enforcement officers to \"demand\" ID, there is no statutory requirement to provide them ID nor is there a penalty for refusing to, hence Wisconsin is not a must ID state. ''[https://www.leagle.com/decision/1995532194wis2d3381517 Henes v. Morrissey]'', 194 Wis.2d 338, 353-54 (1995).  Annotations for Wisconsin \u00a7968.24, however, state \"The principles of ''Terry'' permit a state to require a suspect to disclose his or her name in the course of a ''Terry'' stop and allow imposing criminal penalties for failing to do so\", citing ''[[Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial District Court of Nevada|Hiibel]]'' as authority.\nHiibel held that statutes requiring suspects to disclose their names during police investigations did not violate the Fourth Amendment if the statute first required reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal involvement. The Wisconsin Supreme Court held in Henes v. Morrissey that \"A crime is made up of two parts: proscribed conduct and a prescribed penalty. \"The former without the latter is no crime. ...  In this case no statute penalizes a refusal to identify oneself to a law enforcement officer, and no penalty is set forth in the statute for refusing to identify oneself. This statute is part of Chapter 968 entitled \"Commencement of Criminal Proceedings. By its very terms sec. 968.24 empowers a law enforcement officer to stop and question \"in the vicinity where the person was stopped.\" The statute does not authorize a law enforcement officer to make an arrest.\"(These quotes comes from the dissenting opinion but is in line with the majority opinion.) Additionally Henes v. Morrissey held that a detained person not providing their name isn't on its own a violation of 946.41 Resisting or obstructing officer as the act of not identifying one's self\nisn't a false statement with intent to mislead the officer in the performance of his or her duty.\n\nNeither is Illinois, since the Illinois Second District Appellate Court Decision in ''People v. Fernandez'', 2011 IL App (2d) 100473, which specifically states that section 107-14 is found in the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963, not the Criminal Code of 1961, and governs the conduct of police officers. The fact remains that there is no corresponding duty in the Criminal Code of 1961 for a suspect to identify himself\nor herself.<ref>http://www.illinoiscourts.gov/opinions/AppellateCourt/2011/2ndDistrict/December/2100473.pdf</ref>\n\nAs of February 2011, there is no U.S. federal law requiring that an individual identify himself during a ''Terry'' stop, but ''Hiibel'' held that states may enact such laws, provided the law requires the officer to have reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal involvement,<ref>\nThe ''Hiibel'' Court held, \"The principles of ''Terry'' permit a State to require a suspect to disclose his name in the course of a ''Terry'' stop.\" {{nowrap|\u2014 542 U.S. at 187}}</ref> and 24 states have done so.<ref>The opinion in ''Hiibel'' included a list of 21 states with \"stop and identify\" laws.\nFor some reason, the Indiana law was not included in the list; the Arizona and Ohio laws have been enacted since ''Hiibel'' was decided. The Texas law only applies to arrested persons.</ref> The opinion in ''Hiibel'' implied that persons detained by police in jurisdictions with constitutional<ref>\"Constitutional\" means that the law requires the officer to have reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal involvement. See ''Hiibel''.</ref> \"stop and identify\" laws listed are obligated to identify themselves,<ref>Writing for the Court in ''Hiibel'', Justice Kennedy stated, \"the source of the legal obligation [to identify oneself] arises from Nevada state law\". {{nowrap|\u2014 542 U.S. at 187}}</ref> and that persons detained in other jurisdictions are not.<ref>In ''Hiibel'', Justice Kennedy stated, \"In other States, a suspect may decline to identify himself without penalty.\u2033 {{nowrap|\u2014 542 U.S.  at 183}}</ref>\nThe issue may not be that simple, however, for several reasons:\n* The wording of \"stop and identify\" laws varies considerably from state to state.\n* Noncompliance with a \"stop and identify\" law that does not explicitly impose a penalty may constitute violation of another law, such as one to the effect of \"resisting, obstructing, or delaying a peace officer\".\n* State courts have made varying interpretations of both \"stop and identify\" and \"obstructing\" laws.\n\n=== Variations in \"stop and identify\" laws ===\n\n* Four states' laws (Arizona, Indiana, Louisiana, and Nevada) explicitly impose an obligation to provide identifying information.\n* Fifteen states grant police authority to ask questions, with varying wording, but do not explicitly impose an obligation to respond:\n\n:* In Montana, police \"may request\" identifying information;\n:* In Ohio, identifying information may be required \"when requested\"; an obligation exists only when the police suspect a person is committing, has committed, or is about to commit a criminal offense, is witness to a violent felony offense, or is witness to an attempt or conspiracy to commit a violent felony offense;\n:* In 12 states (Alabama, Delaware, Illinois, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New York, North Dakota, Rhode Island, Utah, Wisconsin), police \"may demand\" identifying information. Of note, though, in New Hampshire for example (RSA 594:2), statutory language authorizing a 'demand' for identity does not establish a legal requirement to provide documentation of identity (ID), or even a requirement to respond in the first place. Further, a law enforcement officer is authorized to make such 'demand' only of individuals for \"whom he has reason to suspect is committing, has committed or is about to commit a crime.\"\n\n* Identifying information varies, but typically includes\n:* Name, address, and an explanation of the person's actions;\n:* In some cases it also includes the person's intended destination, the person's date of birth (Indiana and Ohio), or written identification if available (Colorado). Ohio does not require the person's intended destination. Ohio requires only name, address, or date of birth. Date of birth is NOT required if the age of the person is an element to the crime (such as underage drinking, curfew violation, etc...) that the person is reasonably suspected of.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/2921.29|title=Lawriter - ORC - 2921.29 Failure to disclose personal information.|publisher=State of Ohio Codes}}</ref> Indiana requires either name, address, and date of birth, or driver's license, if on the person's possession, and only applies if the person was stopped for an infraction or ordinance violation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://iga.in.gov/legislative/laws/2016/ic/titles/034/articles/028/chapters/005/#section-3.5|title=Indiana Code 2016 - Indiana General Assembly, 2016 Session|first=Indiana General|last=Assembly|publisher=}}</ref>\n:* Arizona law, apparently written specifically to codify the holding in ''Hiibel'', requires a person's \"true full name\".\n:* Nevada law, which requires a person to \"identify himself or herself\", apparently requires only that the person state his or her name.\n:* Texas law requires a person to provide their name, residence address and date of birth if lawfully arrested and asked by police. (A detained person or witness of a crime is required to provide any identifying information, however it is a crime for a detained person or witness to give a false name.) Texas P.C. 38.02\n* In four states (Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, and Rhode Island), failure to identify oneself is one factor to be considered in a decision to arrest.  In all but Rhode Island, the consideration arises in the context of [[loitering]] or prowling. \n* Seven states (Arizona, Florida, Indiana, Louisiana, New Mexico, Ohio, and Vermont) explicitly impose a criminal penalty for noncompliance with the obligation to identify oneself.\n\nAs of February 2011, the validity of a law requiring that a person detained provide anything more than stating his or her name has not come before the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n=== Interaction with other laws ===\n\nIn states whose \"stop and identify laws\" do not directly impose penalties, a lawful arrest must be for violation of some other law, such as one to the effect of \"resisting, obstructing, or delaying a peace officer\".\nFor example, the Nevada \"stop and identify\" law challenged in ''Hiibel'' did not impose a penalty on a person who refused to comply, but the Justice Court of Union Township, Nevada, determined that Hiibels refusal to identify himself<ref>\nThe opinion noted that Hiibel was asked to provide identification, which the Court understood as a request to produce a driver's license or some other form of written identification, 11 different times; however, it did not indicate that Hiibel was ever asked simply to identify himself.\n</ref>\nconstituted a violation of Nevada \"obstructing\" law.<ref>\nNRS \u00a7199.280 provides a penalty for a person who \"willfully resists, delays or obstructs a public officer in discharging or attempting to discharge any legal duty of his office\"\n</ref>\nA similar conclusion regarding the interaction between Utah \"stop and identify\" and \"obstructing\" laws was reached in ''Oliver v. Woods'' (10th Cir. 2000).\n\n=== Interpretation by courts ===\n\n\"Stop and identify\" laws in different states that appear to be nearly identical may be different in effect because of interpretations by state courts. For example, California \"stop and identify\" law, Penal Code \u00a7647(e) had wording<ref>California stop-and-identify law in Penal Code \u00a7647(e) was repealed several years after 1983 and the sub-sections re-lettered, so the current Penal Code \u00a7647(e) is what used to be Penal Code \u00a7647(f). Also, do not confuse Penal Code \u00a7647(e) with Penal Code \u00a7647e.</ref><ref>(voided in ''Kolender v.

Using this construction, the U.S. Supreme Court held the law to be void for vagueness in ''[[Kolender v.

As such, the statute vests virtually complete discretion in the hands of the police to determine whether the suspect has satisfied the statute. {{nowrap|\u2014 461 U.S. at 358}}\n</ref>\n\nSome courts have recognized a distinction authorizing police to demand identifying information and specifically imposing an obligation of a suspect to respond.<ref>\nWriting for the Court in ''People v. Love'', 318 Ill.App.3d 534 (2000), rev'd on other grounds, ''People v. Love'', No. 90806 (2002), Justice O'Brien stated,\n:The State next argues that the officer's order was a justifiable means of compelling defendant to state her name pursuant to section 107-14, which provides that an officer making a ''Terry'' stop may \"demand the name and address of the person and an explanation of his actions.\" 725 ILCS 5/107-14 (West 1992). However, while section 107-14 states that an officer may \"demand\" the defendant's name, it does not provide that the officer may compel a response. Further, the United States Supreme Court has stated in the context of a ''Terry'' stop: \"[T]he officer may ask the detainee a moderate number of questions to determine his identity and to try to obtain information confirming or dispelling the officer's suspicions. ''But the detainee is not obliged to respond''.\" (Emphasis added.) ''Berkemer v. McCarty'', 468 U.S. 420, 438, 82 L. Ed. 2d 317, 334, 104 S. Ct. 3138, 3150 (1984).\nNoting ''Berkemer v. McCarty'' (and Justice White's concurring opinion in ''Terry'' that ''Berkemer'' quoted), the ''Hiibel'' Court stated, \"We do not read these statements as controlling\" (542 U.S. at 187), so ''Love'' is probably weakened to the extent that it relies on ''Berkemer''.\n</ref>\nOther courts have apparently interpreted ''demand'' to impose an obligation on the detainee to comply.<ref>\nIn ''Cady v. Sheahan'' (7th Cir. 2006), the Court stated,\n:In ''Hiibel'', the Supreme Court held that states are permitted to statutorily authorize the demand for identification during a ''Terry'' stop, and to require compliance with such demand. 542 U.S. at 188, 124 S.Ct. 2451. Cady's identity was relevant to the purpose of the stop and the officers did not exceed the scope of the stop by requesting identification.

Moreover, an individual who merely refuses to refrain from performing any act that would impede the arrest or detention violates this section.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Thus, Officer Woods gave a lawful order when he told Mr. Oliver to present identification and to remain in the parking lot while he conducted the investigation. By refusing to present identification, Mr. Oliver refused to perform an act required by lawful order, necessary to effect the detention.\n</ref>\n\nIt is not universally agreed that, absent a \"stop and identify law\", there is no obligation for a detainee to identify himself. For example, as the U.S. Supreme Court noted in ''Hiibel'', California \"stop and identify\" statute was voided in ''Kolender v. Lawson''. But in ''People v. Long'',<ref>\nIn ''People v. Long'' (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 77, Justice Agliano wrote,\n:The voluntary display of identification is a routine experience for most of us. Measured against the obvious and substantial need for police recording the identity of a person suspected of having committed a crime, we find reasonable the minimal intrusion involved here in requiring the production of identification. In addition, defendant's oral statement of his name was suspect when he insisted he had no identification while appearing to carry a wallet and, in addition, he seemed intoxicated. {{nowrap|\u2014 189 Cal.App.3d at 88}}\n</ref>\ndecided four years after ''Kolender'', a California appellate court found no constitutional impropriety in a police officer's demand for written identification from a detainee whom they reasonably suspect of having committed a crime. The issue before the ''Long'' court was a request for suppression of evidence uncovered in a search of the defendant's wallet, so the issue of refusal to present identification was not directly addressed; however, the author of the ''Long'' opinion had apparently concluded in a 1980 case that failure to identify oneself did not provide a basis for arrest.<ref>\nIn ''In re Gregory S.'' (1980), 112 Cal.App.3d 764, Justice Agliano wrote\n:We find no authority to support the court's legal conclusion that a person who merely refuses to identify himself or to answer questions in a context similar to that before us thereby violates Penal Code section 148 or otherwise furnishes ground for arrest.\n\n:The Legislature has required citizen self-identification in prescribed situations. Vehicle Code section 40302 calls for the production of a driver's license or identification upon arrest for a violation of that code; Vehicle Code section 12951 requires production of a driver's license by the driver of a motor vehicle upon the request of an officer. Penal Code section 647, subdivision (e) imposes a duty to identify oneself when such person loiters or wanders upon the streets or from place to place without apparent reason or business, and the surrounding circumstances reasonably indicate that the public safety demands identification. Section 647, subdivision (e) was held valid in ''People v. Solomon'' (1973) 33 Cal.App.3d 429 [108 Cal.Rptr. 867], in which strong consideration was given to the legislatively declared governmental purpose to be served by identification when the conditions described in the statute exist. (Id, at p. 436; see also ''California v. Byers'' (1971) 402 U.S. 424 [29 L.Ed.2d 9, 91 S.Ct. 1535].) None of the statutory conditions requiring identification existed in this case. {{nowrap|\u2014 112 Cal.App.3d at 779}}\n\nNote: Penal Code 647, subdivision (e) was voided by the U.S. Supreme Court in ''Kolender v. Lawson'' (1983).\n</ref>\nNonetheless, some cite ''Long'' in maintaining that refusal to present written identification constitutes obstructing an officer.<ref>\n Shortly after ''Hiibel'' was decided, the [[Alameda County (California)]] [http://le.alcoda.org/ District Attorney's Office] provided a [http://le.alcoda.org/publications/point_of_view/files/Hiibel.pdf case analysis] (PDF)\nmaintaining that refusal to identify oneself and provide written identification (if available)  constitutes a violation of Penal Code \u00a7148(a)(1), resisting, delaying, or obstructing an officer.  The topic is further discussed in the [http://le.alcoda.org/publications/point_of_view/2010_editions 2010 edition] \nof ''[http://le.alcoda.org/publications/point_of_view/ Point of View]''.\n</ref>\nOthers disagree, and maintain that persons detained by police in California cannot be compelled to identify themselves.<ref>\nThe [http://ag.ca.gov/publications/index.php ''California Peace Officers Legal Sourcebook''] (\"CPOLS\"; written by the office of the [[California Attorney General]]) maintains that failure to identify oneself does not constitute a violation of [[California Penal Code]] \u00a7148(a)(1), resisting, delaying, or obstructing a peace officer:\n:Unlike Nevada and other states, California does ''not'' have a statute mandating that a detainee identify himself, and that obligation cannot be read into Penal Code section 148. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.  ''Hiibel'' does not provide a means of ''arresting'' someone for failing or refusing to identify himself. (Revision 176, 9/15/2014, p.&nbsp;2.14a; page last revised 1/10)\n</ref>\n\nSome courts, e.g., ''State v. Flynn'' (Wis. 1979)<ref>\nIn ''State v. Flynn'' (1979) 92 Wis.2d 427 [285 N.W.2d 710, 718], cert. den. 449 U.S. 846, the Wisconsin Supreme Court held that the ''Terry'' limitation of a search \"to an intrusion reasonably designed to discover guns, knives, clubs, or other hidden instruments for the assault of the police officer.\" (392 U.S. at 29) was limited to the specific circumstances of ''Terry''. [[Bruce F. Beilfuss|Chief Justice Beilfuss]] wrote,\n:It is clear from the language itself that the court's holding in ''Terry'' was limited to the precise situation before it. The court did not say that the sole justification for any search on less than probable cause is the protection of the police officer and others, but that that was the sole justification of the search in the situation then before it. The situation before us is significantly different.\n</ref>\nand ''People v. Loudermilk'' (Calif. 1987)<ref>\nIn ''People v. Loudermilk'' (1987) 195 Cal.App.3d 996, Justice Low stated,\n:Neither case [''Kolender v. Lawson'' or ''Brown v. Texas''] could be interpreted to prevent a police officer from demanding that a ''Terry'' suspect produce proof of identification. Further, nothing in those or other cases cited by defendant prevents an officer from seizing a wallet found during a lawful patdown search after that suspect has lied to the officer that he had no identification. {{nowrap|\u2014 195 Cal.App.3d at 1003}}\nJustice Low noted the similarity to ''Flynn'', and continued,\n:We must emphasize that we do not hold that a suspect may be detained and searched merely because he either refused to identify himself or refused to produce proof of identification. Nor do we hold that each time an officer conducts a Terry stop he may immediately conduct a search for identification. The rule we announce does not provide officers with unfettered discretion and does not open citizens to harassment. {{nowrap|\u2014 195 Cal.App.3d at 1004}}\n</ref>\nhave held that police may perform a search for written identification if a suspect refuses to provide it;\na later California decision, ''People v. Garcia'' (2006) strongly disagreed.<ref>\nIn ''People v. Garcia'' (2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 782, Justice Yegan, noting ''State v. Flynn'' (Wis. 1979) and ''State v. Wilcox'' (N.J. 1981), stated,\n:We need not look to other jurisdictions to decide this case. We would have to indulge in legal legerdemain to justify a patdown search for identification. In fact, it would require a rewriting of ''Terry v. Ohio'', ''supra,'' which we could not and would not undertake even if we were so inclined. Here, the record is devoid of any concern that appellant was armed and dangerous. The sole reason for the patdown was to gather evidence of identification.\n:A fair reading of ''Terry v. Ohio'', and its reference to the lower court opinion in ''State v. Terry'' show that the \"frisk\" allowable upon a proper showing was \"&nbsp;'.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. only a \"frisk\" for a dangerous weapon. It by no means authorizes a search for contraband, evidentiary material, or anything else in the absence of reasonable grounds to arrest. Such a search is controlled by requirements of the Fourth Amendment, and probable cause is essential.'&nbsp;\" (''Terry v. Ohio'', ''supra'', 392 U.S. at p. 16, fn. 12 [20 L. Ed. 2d at p. 903, fn. 12.) Our own Supreme Court has unanimously so held. (''People v. Lawler''   (1973) 9 Cal.3d 156, 161 [pat-down search \"only\" for weapons].) If ''stare decisis'' means anything (and it does) and if the word ''only'' means ''only'' (and it does), the trial court was required to grant this suppression motion as a matter of law. (''Auto Equity Sales, Inc. v. Superior Court'' (1962) 57 Cal.2d 450.) {{nowrap|\u2014 145 Cal.App.4th at 788}}\n</ref>\n\nIn the case of ''[[Utah v. Strieff]]'' (2016), the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that an officer's stop of Edward Strieff and his demand for identification from Strieff was unlawful under Utah state law, but that the evidence collected pursuant to the stop was admissible due to the determination that Strieff was subject to a pre-existing arrest warrant. Therefore, the pre-existing warrant \"attenuated\" the unlawful stop-and-identify.\n\n=== Recommendations of legal-aid organizations ===\n\nSome legal organizations, such as the [[National Lawyers Guild]] and the [[ACLU]] of Northern California,\nrecommend to either remain silent or to identify oneself whether or not a jurisdiction has a \"stop and identify\" law:\n:And in any state, police do not always follow the law, and refusing to give your name may make them suspicious and lead to your arrest, so use your judgment. If you fear that your name may be incriminating, you can claim the right to remain silent, and if you are arrested, this may help you later. Giving a false name could be a crime.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nlgsf.org/resources/kyr_english.pdf |format=pdf |title=Know Your Rights!

Normally these countries provide all residents with [[Identity document|national identity cards]], which have the identity information the police would want to know, including citizenship. Foreign visitors need to have their passport available to show at all times. In some cases national identity cards from certain other countries are accepted.\n\nFor example, in [[Portugal]] it is compulsory to carry the state ID card at all times. This card named [[Cart\u00e3o de Cidad\u00e3o]] - Citizen Card is an electronic card which includes biometric information, id number, social security number, fiscal information, place of birth, etc. Police can only ask for the ID card in public or a place open to public and only if there is a reasonable suspicion the person committed a crime. A certified copy of the ID card can be presented in such situations. If a citizen does not carry the ID card or its certified copy, the police will escort the person to the police department to remain detained until clear identification can be obtained.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.direitosedeveres.pt/q/vida-pessoal-e-familiar/identidade/um-cidadao-traz-habitualmente-consigo-apenas-uma-fotocopia-do-cartao-de-cidadao-ou-do-bilhete-de-identidade-se-a-|title=Um cidad\u00e3o traz habitualmente consigo apenas uma fotoc\u00f3pia do cart\u00e3o de cidad\u00e3o ou do bilhete de identidade.

(info@view.pt -|last=www.view.pt)|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn other countries like Australia, Canada, and New Zealand, police generally have no power to demand identification unless they have a statutory power to do so. For example, these countries have laws that require those driving to produce their licence (or state their name, address, etc.) when stopped by police. Police may also require people to identify themselves if they have reasonable grounds to believe that they have committed a crime.<ref>http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2008/0072/latest/whole.html#DLM1351201</ref><ref>http://svan.ca/police-rights/</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* ''[[Brown v.

An agreement was reached between December 1979 and January 1980, with production scheduled for the Termini Imerese Autobianchi di Desio plants.<ref name=\"tribe1\"/>\n\nOn February 26, 1980, Fiat presented the Panda to President [[Sandro Pertini]], in the gardens of Rome's [[Quirinal Palace]], and the car officially debuted in Geneva on March 5th \u2014 carrying the ''Panda'' name. \n\nIn the two months following the Geneva motor show, Fiat received over 70,000 orders for the Panda.\n\n===Design===\nItaldesign's work highlighted utilitarian practicality throughout the design. Just prior to the Panda's debut at the 1980 Geneva Salon de l'Auto, Giugiaro described his design intent in a 1980 interview with [[Turin]]ese newspaper ''[[La Stampa]]'', published in February 1980:\n\n{{quote|1=\u00abLa Panda (...) \u00e8 come un paio di jeans, che sono poi un vestire semplice, pratico, senza fronzoli.

The interior rear-view mirror had no day/night adjustment, and ventilation was oriented soley for demisting the windshield. Without vengting to the interior through the dash, side windows featured vent windows and optional pop-out rear windows.\n\nLuigi Maglione, Fiat's marketing strategist, was perplexed when first seeing the interior design, suggesting the interior mock-up was missing.

Rear suspension used a [[solid axle]] suspended on [[leaf spring]]s. Later versions added mechanical improvements while retaining a robust simplicity throughout its model life.\n\nLaunch models included the '''Panda 30''', powered by a [[Longitudinal engine|longitudinally-mounted]] [[Air cooling|air cooled]] 652&nbsp;cc [[Straight-twin engine|straight-two-cylinder engine]] derived from the 126,<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Quattroruote |title=Anteprima: La \"Mini\" si toglie il cilindro: Tutte le bicilindriche |trans-title=Preview: The Mini loses a cylinder: All of the bicylinders |language=it |date=September 1984 |volume=29 |issue=347 |publisher=Editoriale Domus |location=Milan, Italy |first=Alessandro |last=Ferrari |pages=70\u201371}}</ref> and the '''Panda 45''', with a [[Transverse engine|transversely-mounted]] [[Water cooling|water cooled]] 903&nbsp;cc ([[Fiat 100 series engine|FIAT 100 series]]) [[Inline-four engine|four-cylinder]] from the 127. As a consequence of the different drivetrain layout the 45 had the radiator grille to the right side, the 30 to the left. In September 1982 Fiat added another engine to the line-up: the '''Panda 34''' used an 843&nbsp;cc water-cooled unit, derived from that in the [[Fiat 850|850]]. It was originally reserved for export to France, Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands.<ref name=TAM85>{{cite book |title=Quattroruote: Tutte le Auto del Mondo 1985 |editor=Mastrostefano, Raffaele |publisher=Editoriale Domus S.p.A |ref=TAM85 |year=1985 |page=290 |language=it |location=Milano |isbn=88-7212-012-8}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Fiat Panda post facelift.jpg|thumb|left|A pre-facelift Panda Super]]\nFiat launched the '''Panda 45 Super''' at the [[Paris Motor Show]] later in 1982, with previous specification models continuing as the \"Comfort\" trim. The Super offered an optional five-speed gearbox. Minor styling changes to the Super included Fiat's revised corporate grille with five diagonal silver bars. The earlier grille design (metal with slots on the left for ventilation) continued on the Comfort models until the next major revision of the line-up. A 30 Super was added in February 1983, offering the Super trim combined with the smaller engine.\n\nThe Panda [[four-wheel drive|4x4]] was launched in June 1983, powered by a 965&nbsp;cc engine with {{convert|48|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} derived from the [[Autobianchi A112]] or [[Fiat 100 series engine]]. Known simply as the Panda 4x4, this model was the first small, transverse-engined production car to have a 4WD system.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The system itself was manually selectable, with an ultra-low first gear. Under normal (on-road) conditions starting was from second, with the fifth gear having the same ratio as fourth in the normal Panda. [[Austria]]n company [[Steyr-Puch]] supplied the entire drivetrain (clutch, gearbox, power take-off, three-piece propshaft, rear live axle including differential and brakes) to the plant at Termini Imerese where it was fitted to the reinforced bodyshell.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cohort Classic: Fiat Panda 4\u00d74 \u2013 Simply Simple|url=http://www.curbsideclassic.com/curbside-classics-european/cohort-classic-fiat-panda-4x4-simply-brilliant/|work=curbsideclassic.com|accessdate=5 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn November 1984 trim levels were named \"L\", \"CL\", and \"S\". Specifications and detailing were modified across the range, using the Fiat corporate grille on all trims. Mechanically the range remained largely unchanged.\n\n====First facelift====\n[[File:1989 FIAT Panda.jpg|thumb|right|S post-facelift Panda]]\nIn January 1986, the Panda received visual and mechanical revisions \u2014 with many pre- and post-facelift Panda parts incompatible. The facelift version was internally designated '''141A'''.\n\nThe 652 cc air-cooled two-cylinder engine was replaced by a 769&nbsp;cc (34&nbsp;PS) water-cooled four-cylinder unit, and the 903/965cc by a 999&nbsp;cc (45&nbsp;PS, 50&nbsp;PS (37&nbsp;kW) in the 4x4) unit. Both new engines were from Fiat's new [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] family of four-cylinder water-cooled powerplants with a single overhead camshaft. The rear suspension was also upgraded, the rigid axle with leaf springs being replaced by a more modern dependent suspension system known as the \"Omega axle\", consisting of a non-straight rigid axle with a central mounting and coil springs (first seen on the [[Lancia Y10]], which used the same platform). The 4x4 retained the leaf-sprung live axle set-up.\n\nThe body was strengthened and fully galvanised on later models, virtually eliminating the earlier car's notable tendency to rust.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Rear quarter panels received wheel arches mirroring the front fender/wing wheel arches. Front door quarter windows were eliminated. The bottom seam of the facelifted model's doors retained much the earlier car's susceptibility to rust.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The range included 750L, 750CL, 750S, 1000CL, 1000S, 4x4 models.\n\n[[File:Fiat panda 2 sst.jpg|thumb|right|Fiat Panda Van]]\n[[File:1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 SISLEY (3863394372).jpg|thumb|left|1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 Sisley]]\n\nApril 1986 saw the introduction of a 1301&nbsp;cc diesel engine with 37&nbsp;bhp (a detuned 127/Uno unit). Fitted as standard with a five-speed gearbox it was only available in the basic \"L\" trim and was available until 1989 (until 1994 in the van versions).\n\nA van variant of the Panda was introduced, with both petrol and diesel engines. The van elimated rear seats and featured rear windows replaced with plastic blanking panels and a small, black, steel extension with side hinged doors \u2014in lieu of a hatch tailgate. Neither the van nor the diesel were available in right hand drive markets.\n\nIn 1987, an entry-level model badged \"Panda Young\" was added to the range. This was essentially an L spec car with a 769&nbsp;cc OHV engine based on the old 903 cc push-rod [[Fiat 100 series engine|FIAT 100]] engine and producing the same 34&nbsp;bhp (25&nbsp;kW) as the more sophisticated 769&nbsp;cc FIRE unit. The Panda 4x4 Sisley limited edition was also released, based on the standard 4x4, with metallic paint, inclinometer, white painted wheels, roof rack, headlamp washers, bonnet scoop, \"Sisley\" badging and trim. Although originally limited to the production of only 500, in 1989 the Sisley model became a permanent model.\n\n====Panda Elettra====\n[[File:Fiat Panda Elettra 1990.JPG|thumb|left|Panda Elettra in Santiago de Chile, 2010]]\nThe two-seat Panda Elettra, introduced in 1990, added an all-electric power-train to the line.

The Elettra was discontinued in 1998.\n\n====Second facelift====\n[[File:1997 Fiat Panda.JPG|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n[[File:Fiat Panda rear 20071205.jpg|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n1991, revisions included a front grille with a smaller five-bar corporate badge, as well as revisions to trim and specifications across the range. New arrivals included the 'Selecta', which had a [[continuously variable transmission]] with an electromagnetic clutch. This transmission was available either with the normal 999&nbsp;cc FIRE engine (revised with single-point fuel injection and a [[catalytic converter]]) or an all new 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit, fitted with electronic fuel injection and a three-way catalytic converter and producing {{convert|51|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe new CLX trim also featured a five-speed gearbox as standard. The range now comprised the 750 Young (769&nbsp;cc ohv), 750 and 750 CLX (both 769&nbsp;cc FIRE sohc), 900 Dance (903&nbsp;cc ohv), 1000 Shopping, CLX, CL Selecta and S (all with 999&nbsp;cc sohc, available with or without SPI and catalytic converter depending on the market), 1100 CL Selecta (1108&nbsp;cc sohc with SPI and cat) and the 4x4 Trekking (999&nbsp;cc, again available with and without a cat depending on the market). The Elettra concluded the range.\n\nIn 1992, the 1108&nbsp;cc engine, complete with SPI and catalytic converter, replaced the 999&nbsp;cc unit in the 4x4 (with 50&nbsp;bhp) and also in 1992 an 899&nbsp;cc (with injection and catalyst) became available, in the 'Cafe' special edition. This was a reduced capacity 903&nbsp;cc unit, designed to meet tax requirements in some markets. Non-catalyzed versions were withdrawn about this time.\n\nIn January 2001, the range underwent its final light adjustment. The 4x4 Trekking continued to be available, while front-wheel-drive versions were down to the Young and the Hobby. The 899&nbsp;cc was discontinued and only the Euro&nbsp;3 capable, fuel injected 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit remained available. These Pandas featured a body-coloured flap for the gas tank, rather than the exposed black plastic cap of earlier models.\n\n====End of production====\nThe Panda was discontinued in the UK in 1995.<ref>https://www.exchangeandmart.co.uk/reviews/fiat/panda/2004/209626</ref> The car remained in production in Italy until May 2003. Its total production run of 23 years makes the Fiat Panda one of Europe's longest-lived small cars.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n===SEAT Panda / Marbella===\n[[File:Fiat Panda 1st series pink vl.jpg|thumb|right|SEAT Marbella]]\n[[File:SEATTransfront.jpg|thumb|left|SEAT Trans]]\n{{main|SEAT Marbella}}\nSpanish car maker [[SEAT]] also produced a version of the Panda between 1980 and 1986, based on the first Panda model. It was called '''SEAT Panda'''. SEAT also made a tiny, tall delivery version of the Panda called the SEAT Trans.\n\nUp to 1983, SEAT made rebadged versions of Fiat cars through a [[licence]] agreement between the two firms. Thus, there existed a Spanish version of the Panda. When [[Pope John Paul II]] visited Spain in 1982, he rode in a specially built SEAT Panda.\n\nAfter Fiat sold their share in SEAT and the licence agreement ended, the whole Fiat-based line of SEAT cars were quickly given minor facelifts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The SEAT Panda had its bonnet, bumpers and rear tailgate redesigned. From 1986, when it received a second facelift, it was known as the SEAT Marbella until the end of production in 1998. Emelba also produced a roofless version called the Pandita, which was popular as a rental car in resort areas. The SEAT Trans also received a major facelift and was renamed SEAT Terra.\n\nAs Fiat and SEAT's licensing agreement had expired in 1986 the Marbella never received the major mechanical upgrades of the facelifted Fiat Panda, instead continuing with the old [[pushrod]] Fiat-based engines, quarter light doors, un-galvanised frame and leaf-sprung suspension as for the original model. It was popular in Spain throughout its production life, but was less popular on export markets (where the Fiat version was firm favourite) and by 1996, exports had mostly finished.\n\n===Reception and awards===\nThe first generation Panda met with great success across Europe, polling 2nd in the 1981 [[European Car of the Year]] awards in its first full year of production<ref name=\"caroftheyear.org\">{{cite web | url = http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | title = Previous Cars | accessdate = 29 January 2012 | work = caroftheyear.org | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120101121344/http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | archivedate = 1 January 2012 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> (pipped to first place by the [[Escort xr3i|Ford Escort Mark III]]) and remaining on sale in some regions until May 2003.<ref name=\"panda-marbella.webs.com\">{{cite web|url=http://panda-marbella.webs.com/|title=Fiat Panda|accessdate=24 April 2011|work=panda-marbella.webs.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429011137/http://www.panda-marbella.webs.com/|archivedate=29 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981 Giugiaro received the Italian [[Compasso d'Oro]] [[Associazione per il Disegno Industriale|ADI]] [[industrial design]] [[award]] for the Panda.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,13/articleid,1054_01_1981_0221_0013_18646326/anews,true/ |title=Compasso d'oro alla Fiat Panda |date=13 September 1981 |page=13 |newspaper=[[La Stampa]] |language=it |accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref>\nA less positive reaction to the design came from German magazine [[Der Spiegel]], which in 1980 contrasted Giugiaro defining the Panda as \"the most enchanting work of his life\", and chief designer Felice Cornacchia describing himself as \"proud overall of the car's architecture\" to Peter Glodschey, road tester of mass-market [[Bild]] newspaper, who likened the car to \"a shoe box\".<ref name=\"Spiege071980\">{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-14325284.html|title=Legitimer Erbe: Mit einem neuen Kleinwagen will Italiens gebeutelter Auto-Riese Fiat auf dem deutschen Markt vergraulte Kunden zur\u00fcckgewinnen |quote=Stylist Giorgio Giugiaro: \"F\u00fcr mich war dies die reizvollste Arbeit meines Lebens.\" Chefkonstrukteur Felice Cornacchia: \"Am meisten bin ich stolz auf die Architektur des Wagens.\" Mit einem \"Schuhkarton\" verglich \"Bild\"-Autotester Peter Glodschey den neuen Panda.

In its development phase, the Panda was intended to be called \"Gingo\", but Renault objected because it sounded too close to their Twingo.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe second generation replaced the old Panda after 23 years of production. Like the smaller [[Fiat Seicento]], the Panda was manufactured only in [[Tychy]], Poland, by [[Fiat Auto Poland]].\n\nThe high-bodied Panda takes styling cues from [[mini MPV]]s and [[mini SUV]]s, especially the second generation [[Fiat Multipla]]. The Panda won the [[European Car of the Year]] award in 2004.\n\nThe Panda includes an option for split rear seats, which makes the Panda a four-seater. Since September 2005, all Pandas are equipped with [[anti-lock braking system|ABS]], [[electronic brakeforce distribution|EBD]] and at least one front airbag. The gear-lever is located high on the central dashboard, which is designed to make changing gears more comfortable than with a conventional floor-mounted gearstick.\n\nFinancially troubled Fiat needed the new Panda to be a success, and it sold half a million units by October 2005. It sells particularly well in Italy (over half of the cars produced are sold in Italy), being seen as closer to a spiritual successor to the [[Fiat 500]] than a replacement for either the Seicento or the old Panda.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n* The 500,000th new Panda was built on 5 October 2005, a light blue Panda Emotion with the 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].\n* The 1,000,000th new Panda was built on 5 September 2007, a red Panda 4x4 Climbing with 1.2-litre petrol engine.<ref name=\"italiaspeed.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2007/cars/fiat/09/panda_1_million/0509.html|date=5 September 2007 |title=One millionth Fiat Panda rolls off the production lines |accessdate=8 September 2007|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 1,500,000th new Panda was built on 21 July 2009, a blue Panda Emotion with 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"www.fiat.pl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2009/cars/fiat/07/panda_15_million/2407.html|date=24 July 2009 |title=Fiat Panda number 1,500,000 rolls off the lines at Tychy|accessdate=28 July 2009|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 2,000,000th new Panda rolled out of factory on 4 July 2011, a red Panda 4x4 Cross with 1.3-litre 75&nbsp;bhp Multijet [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"2-millionth-nuova-Panda\">{{cite web|url=http://italiaspeed.com/2011/cars/fiat/07/panda_2_million/0407.html|date=5 July 2011|title=Two millionth second generation Fiat Panda is built at Tychy|accessdate=5 July 2011|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Top Gear (magazine)|Top Gear]] Motoring Survey in 2006 ranked the Panda 8th out of 152 cars surveyed for reliability, craftsmanship, ownership costs, driving experience and service received.

These models feature revised 1.1 and 1.2 petrol engines respectively, with better fuel economy and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Both models also qualify for \u00a330 annual road fund licence in the UK, and replace the original standard engines. Dynamic Aircon and SkyDome models were also dropped in favour of simplifying the Panda range.\n\nOn 4 July 2011, Fiat announced that the 2,000,000th Panda had rolled off of their Tychy, Poland assembly line. The milestone car was a Panda Cross finished in Rosso Sfrontato and equipped with the 75&nbsp;hp 1.3&nbsp;L Multijet four-cylinder diesel.

The engine range comprised the 1.2 Fire petrol, 1.2 Fire EasyPower (petrol and LPG), 1.4 Fire Natural Power (petrol and CNG) and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The 4x4 was offered with 1.2 petrol and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The Panda Cross was no longer manufactured. The Panda Classic was produced through 2012.\n\n===Models===\n* The '''Natural Power''' is a dual-fuel version, it can burn either gasoline or CNG (Compressed Natural Gas a.k.a. methane). Methane results in low emissions and increased fuel economy. The chassis is the same of the 4x4, the space of the rear wheels differential is occupied by two methane tanks allowing over 240&nbsp;km of autonomy on gas only.\n* The basic '''Actual''' has black bumpers, lacks electric windows and a full-size spare wheel. The Actual was introduced in January 2004.\n* The '''Active''', introduced in May 2003, features black self-coloured bumpers and front electric windows, central door locking, [[Vehicle audio|radio/cassette player]], driver's airbag, power steering. Manual climate control is available as an option. Since September 2005, ABS and the front passenger's airbag have been made standard. This model has the 1100&nbsp;cc \"FIRE\" engine and a five-speed gearbox.\n* The '''Active Plus''' edition is an up-equipped ''Active'', with a [[Cassette player|cassette]]/[[CD player]] as standard. Production of the Active Plus stopped in December 2003.\n* The '''Dynamic''' edition features [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]], dual airbags, roof bars, power steering and a [[cassette player]] as standard. A CD & MP3 player, [[CD changer]], alloy wheels, manual or automated [[climate control]], glass sunroof and a semi-automatic transmission are available as options. Since September 2005, four [[airbag]]s have been standard in some countries, with an option for two additional [[Airbags#Side tubular or curtain airbag|side curtain airbags]].\n* The '''Emotion (Eleganza)''' edition is the highest trim level. This particular trim level features significant enhancements over the Dynamic, with a standard CD player, alloy wheels with low profile tires and automated [[climate control]]. In some countries such as the UK, the Emotion is sold as the \"Eleganza\".\n\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Front.jpg\n| image2   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Rear.jpg\n| caption2 = Fiat Panda 100HP\n}}\n* The '''100&nbsp;HP''' edition is the sportiest Panda model. It has the 1.4-litre 16-valve [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] petrol engine from the [[Fiat Punto]] tuned to develop {{convert|100|PS|kW bhp|abbr=on}} through a six-speed manual transmission. It differs from other Pandas by being equipped with 4-wheel disc brakes, tinted windows, and sports styled front and rear bumpers. The Panda 100&nbsp;HP features a unique suspension setup with modified springs, dampers, bushes and compliance giving a considerably firmer ride.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp offers 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h acceleration in 9.5&nbsp;s and a maximum speed of {{convert|185|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with fuel consumption at {{convert|6.5|L/100 km|1|abbr=on}} in the EU combined cycle and 154&nbsp;g/km of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. It was available in black, white, red, metallic blue, and metallic gray while a \"Pandamonium Pack\" which added red disc brakes, decals and colour-coded wing mirrors was an optional extra.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp was introduced in 2006, but due to tightening emissions regulations, Fiat halted its production in July 2010.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n* The '''4x4 Climbing''' edition, introduced in December 2004, has a higher ride height and larger wheels and tires than other editions. The [[four-wheel drive]] system also makes this edition slower than others. Features are similar to those found in the Dynamic. The Climbing, however, lacks a differential lock and transmission with reductor. The Climbing edition can be distinguished by a slightly higher suspension, additional black plastic overlays on the bumpers and a \"Climbing\" badge just below the \"Panda\" badge on the left side of the rear licence plate. Swedish magazine Vi Bil\u00e4gare found in a test 2007 that Panda 4x4 is a good and economical choice for a small family who need a car with four-wheel drive.\n* The '''Cross''' edition, similar to the Climbing, features differently shaped front and rear lights and additional side cladding. Unlike the Climbing, the Cross does have a differential lock. The Cross edition became available in January 2006 in [[Italy]] and was also available in other markets including right-hand drive.\n\nThe Actual and Active are also bases for the '''Actual Van''' and '''Active Van''', which can be used as small vans (they also have an additional safety net behind the front seats and removable rear seats). These versions can be identified by small \"Van\" label on the back door.\n\nDuring the time, many limited editions of Panda (Active and Dynamic editions only) were produced. Each of them had additional interior fittings, differentiating them from the base model.\n\n===Prototypes and special editions===\n* The '''360 Special Series''', based on the 1.2 L Dynamic, is distinguished by a black and white crosshair style logo on the B pillar. Other upgraded features include; 14&nbsp;inch alloy wheels, metallic paint, special interior trim (including the Fiat brand on the front seats), built in bluetooth phone system, CD player, air conditioning and a split folding rear seat. Other more standard features include; electric windows, central locking system and dual speed power steering. The total of all these extras comes somewhere in the region of \u00a31,600 but surprisingly the upgraded 360 model actually retails at roughly \u00a3400 less than the Dynamic model. On the safety side of things, it comes with anti lock brakes and brake assist as well as two airbags as standard (driver and passenger) with the option of adding an extra four airbags taking the total up to six.\n* '''Fiat Panda Alessi'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda II Alessi 001.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Alessi]]\nItalian Design house [[Alessi (Italian company)|Alessi]] created a special edition featuring a two-tone paint scheme and unique trim inside and out. Fiat gave away some of Alessi's products (coffee machine and tin-can openers) for the special model's debut at the Ideal Home Show in the UK. The rims feature the ''Girotondo'' family accents.\n* '''Fiat Panda Jolly'''\nThe Fiat Panda Jolly was created by Fiat Styling Center and Stola and inspired by boat design. It served as a special shuttle bus in Capri during the summer of 2006. The interior features innovative materials and exclusive trims. The concept mainly came from the 600 Multipla Jolly, a car created by Carrozzeria Ghia in 1956, which could be found on the streets of Capri 50 years ago. Defined by Fiat as \"a car with a fresh, light and Mediterranean look both in the colors and materials\", the Panda Jolly is inspired by the interior design and yacht design worlds, and features styling elements that remind of the spirit and way of life of the 1960s.\n\nThe interiors are created by Paola Lenti, an Italian leading company in the Interior Design sector, specialized in the research and development of innovative fabrics and materials. All the seats are upholstered in the exclusive sailing-inspired Rope fabric. This material is nonallergic, nontoxic, antibacterial and resistant to UV rays. Many structural elements like the floor, sills and various trims are made with pickled natural ash finish with white ash inlays.\n* '''Fiat Panda Terramare 4'''\nPanda Terramare's creator is Milan born Maurizio Zanisi, an independent former [[Iso Rivolta]] engineer, and his self-built amphibian is based on a Panda 4x4 chassis, but with an inflatable flotation belt, and waterjet propulsion driven off the rear axle.\n\nOn 21 July 2006, the Terramare crossed the [[English Channel]] from [[Folkestone]] in Kent to [[Cap Gris Nez]] in just over 6 hours.<ref name=terramare>{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2006/07/21/fiat-panda-marine-edition/ |title=Fiat Panda Terramare 4 makes it across the English Channel |accessdate=15 February 2009 |work=autoblog.com }}</ref>\n* '''Fiat Panda Luxury'''\nAt the 'Luxury & Yachts' show in February 2006, Fiat exhibited a one-off car based on the 4x4 called the 'Luxury'. The outside of the car features dipped silver paintwork, precious metal trim and gleaming jewel-like mouldings with back-lit inset crystals. The interior features dipped silver appointments, precious metal details, Jewel Alcantara upholstery and leather with mother of pearl finish. The Fiat logo is also worked on the seats with stylish studs and crystals.\n* '''Fiat Panda Hydrogen'''\n[[File:FiatPandaHydrogen1.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Hydrogen]]\n{{main|Fiat Panda Hydrogen}}\n\nThe Panda Hydrogen, a prototype driven by a hydrogen Fuel Cell, was a joint venture between Fiat Auto, the Fiat Research Centre and Fiat Powertrain Research & Technology with the support of the Research and Environment Ministries.\n\nOn the Panda Hydrogen, the Fuel Cell System is housed beneath the floorpan. The fuel cells are made up of several cells connected in series. Inside, the hydrogen and oxygen molecules are forced to react with the aid of a catalyst to produce water and heat. Electrical energy is generated with very high efficiency and zero emissions from the vehicle itself.\n\nAt full power, the Fuel Cell engine on the Panda Hydrogen delivers {{convert|60|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} that allows the car to reach a top speed of more than {{convert|130|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with acceleration from 0 to {{convert|50|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} in 5 seconds. The car can also easily climb a gradient of 23% at take-off.\n\nDuring 2006 a demonstration stage of small Panda Hydrogen fleets, was a forerunner to other demonstration programs promoted and supported by the European Union and by the Italian Ministries and Regions. The aim is for such vehicles to be marketed within 15 to 20 years.\n* '''Fiat Panda Tanker'''\nUnveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in Italy, the Panda Tanker features only three doors. And although the overall shape has remained unchanged, the two rear doors have been replaced by solid panels to free up some extra load space in the practical cabin.\nRugged extras and underbody protection also help to set the Tanker apart from the standard Panda 4x4 model. Designed in conjunction with Italian [[extreme sport]] clothing manufacturer Dainese, the show star is equipped with sports seats incorporating a rigid titanium fibre shell.\n\nReflecting the matt paint finish of the exterior, the cabin has a back-to-basics feel. With no rear seats, the load floor offers flexible attachments for fixing sports kit, while an aluminium structure is designed to carry mountain bikes.\n* '''Fiat Panda MultiEco'''\nThe Panda MultiEco show-car made its world debut in Geneva 2006. Fiat sees this unit as the future of cars with a low environmental impact: the concept car represents the most advanced frontier achievable in terms of emissions and consumption, combining technologies that already exist or are ready for production.\n\nThe show-car combines an innovative 'powertrain' architecture&nbsp;\u2013 an engine with dual petrol/methane fuel supply, MTA transmission and BAS device&nbsp;\u2013 with the use of eco-compatible materials (recycled, recyclable or of natural origin) for the exterior and interior. The result is made even more interesting by the painstaking optimisation of the aerodynamics and a significant weight reduction.\n\nPanda MultiEco is equipped with a dual-fuel (methane and petrol) FIRE engine&nbsp;\u2013 future developments will also make it possible to use a methane/hydrogen mix&nbsp;\u2013 combined with a BAS (Belt-driven Alternator-Starter) device and a Dualogic robotised gearbox.\n* '''Fiat PanDAKAR'''\nTwo factory-built Fiat Panda 4x4s were prepared to contest the gruelling [[Dakar 2007]] rally raid, which started in Lisbon.\n\nEntered in the T2 category, the class which most closely represents production vehicles, the two Panda 4x4s, driven by [[Miki Biasion]] and former Dakar winner, [[Bruno Saby]], respectively, are powered by Fiat Auto's 1.3-litre Multijet turbodiesel combined with a six-speed manual gearbox. The engines deliver {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4,500&nbsp;rpm and a peak torque of {{convert|123|lbft|Nm|1|abbr=on}}. at 2,500&nbsp;rpm. Apart from their small dimensions, the two cars are particularly noteworthy for their automatic all-wheel drive system with viscous coupling and locking differential, a system that provides more grip and traction on rough and soft terrain thanks to the optimal split of drive to the wheels.\n\nThe two Pandas competing in Dakar 2007 have been equipped specifically for this rally: so room has been found inside for accessories like aluminium platforms to help extricate the vehicles from soft sand, shovels, spare wheels, water reserves for the crew, and other specialised equipment useful for the occasion. The Fiat expedition to Dakar included a Fiat Sedici as service back-up, and three Iveco trucks to transport spares and technicians.\n\nBoth PanDAKAR retired on the fourth stage of the event.\n* '''Fiat Panda Simba'''\nThe Simba was unveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in 2002 as a concept car to give an idea how the following year's production Panda would look. Some of the rugged styling cues made it on the production '''Cross''' model.\n* '''Fiat Panda Aria'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda Aria 3.jpeg|thumb|Fiat Panda Aria]]\nFiat presented Aria concept in Frankfurt Motor Show 2007. The Aria is equipped with new environment-friendly technology and outputs only 69 g/km [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]]. With 900&nbsp;cc turbocharged [[Straight-twin engine|straight-2]] engine it produces {{convert|80|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, it is also capable of using both petrol and CNG.\n\nThis new engine is equipped with Fiat's Multiair technology, which uses electrohydraulic valve activation system. In monofuel (petrol) version the engine is capable of producing {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The car is also equipped with Stop&Start function, which helps to reduce consumption by 10% in urban driving.<ref name=\"worldcarfans.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/9070903.005/fiat-panda-aria-concept-debut|title=Fiat Panda Aria Concept Debut|accessdate=23 September 2007|work=worldcarfans.com}}</ref>\n\n===Engines===\nThe smallest engine, the 1.1&nbsp;L petrol [[SOHC]] [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine, which is rated at {{convert|54|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and found in the [[Fiat Seicento]], has been criticised{{whom|date=November 2019}} for being underpowered for the Panda, which weighs over {{convert|850|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}, and the acceleration in particular was considered to be very slow. This engine is a construction from the early 1980s.\n\nThe 1.2-litre (actually 1,242&nbsp;cc), {{convert|60|hp|abbr=on}} engine is a derivative of the 1.1 litre, but with higher torque.\n\nThe 1.3-litre [[Multijet]] diesel engine is rated at {{convert|75|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|100|lbft|Nm|-1|abbr=on}} of torque; it is the most economical of all available engines. However, this engine is detuned from the [[Fiat Punto|Punto]] (where it develops {{convert|120|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque) due to the Panda's weaker transmission. Pandas with diesel engines can be easily distinguished by a \"Multijet\" badge on the right side of the rear licence plate.\n\nIntroduced into the range in 2006 was the 1368&nbsp;cc [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine which had previously seen service in the Fiat Stilo and the second generation Punto Sporting (contrary to some press reports, it is not an adapted version of the 1.4 16v Starjet engine used in the Grande Punto). This [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine has four cylinders in-line with sixteen valves actuated by belt driven double overhead camshafts.\n\nThe engine is [[undersquare]] with bore and stroke of {{convert|72|and|84|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} respectively, running at a compression ratio of 10.8:1.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:91%;\"\n|-\n!

The production began in the renewed [[Alfa Romeo Pomigliano d'Arco Plant|Pomigliano d'Arco Plant]] in the last quarter of 2011.\n\nThe older model stayed in production and was sold as Panda Classic, remaining popular thanks to its lower pricing (about 27%). The decision to manufacture the car in Italy, instead of manufacturing it with the cheaper workforce in Tychy, Poland, was taken because of the agreement between Italian Prime Minister [[Mario Monti]] and Fiat directors not to close down any of Fiat's plants in Italy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://finanse.wp.pl/kat,104596,title,Fiat-Panda-odjezdza-z-Polski,wid,15048426,wiadomosc.html |title=Fiat Panda odje\u017cd\u017ca z Polski! - Finanse - WP.PL |publisher=Finanse |date= |accessdate=2 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Models===\n\n====Panda Natural Power====\nThe Natural Power is the [[CNG]]/[[petrol]] [[bi-fuel]] version of the Panda.

Later versions added mechanical improvements while retaining a robust simplicity throughout its model life.\n\nLaunch models included the '''Panda 30''', powered by a [[Longitudinal engine|longitudinally-mounted]] [[Air cooling|air cooled]] 652&nbsp;cc [[Straight-twin engine|straight-two-cylinder engine]] derived from the 126,<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Quattroruote |title=Anteprima: La \"Mini\" si toglie il cilindro: Tutte le bicilindriche |trans-title=Preview: The Mini loses a cylinder: All of the bicylinders |language=it |date=September 1984 |volume=29 |issue=347 |publisher=Editoriale Domus |location=Milan, Italy |first=Alessandro |last=Ferrari |pages=70\u201371}}</ref> and the '''Panda 45''', with a [[Transverse engine|transversely-mounted]] [[Water cooling|water cooled]] 903&nbsp;cc ([[Fiat 100 series engine|FIAT 100 series]]) [[Inline-four engine|four-cylinder]] from the 127. As a consequence of the different drivetrain layout the 45 had the radiator grille to the right side, the 30 to the left. In September 1982 Fiat added another engine to the line-up: the '''Panda 34''' used an 843&nbsp;cc water-cooled unit, derived from that in the [[Fiat 850|850]]. It was originally reserved for export to France, Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands.<ref name=TAM85>{{cite book |title=Quattroruote: Tutte le Auto del Mondo 1985 |editor=Mastrostefano, Raffaele |publisher=Editoriale Domus S.p.A |ref=TAM85 |year=1985 |page=290 |language=it |location=Milano |isbn=88-7212-012-8}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Fiat Panda post facelift.jpg|thumb|left|A pre-facelift Panda Super]]\nFiat launched the '''Panda 45 Super''' at the [[Paris Motor Show]] later in 1982, with previous specification models continuing as the \"Comfort\" trim. The Super offered an optional five-speed gearbox. Minor styling changes to the Super included Fiat's revised corporate grille with five diagonal silver bars. The earlier grille design (metal with slots on the left for ventilation) continued on the Comfort models until the next major revision of the line-up. A 30 Super was added in February 1983, offering the Super trim combined with the smaller engine.\n\nThe Panda [[four-wheel drive|4x4]] was launched in June 1983, powered by a 965&nbsp;cc engine with {{convert|48|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} derived from the [[Autobianchi A112]] or [[Fiat 100 series engine]]. Known simply as the Panda 4x4, this model was the first small, transverse-engined production car to have a 4WD system.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The system itself was manually selectable, with an ultra-low first gear. Under normal (on-road) conditions starting was from second, with the fifth gear having the same ratio as fourth in the normal Panda. [[Austria]]n company [[Steyr-Puch]] supplied the entire drivetrain (clutch, gearbox, power take-off, three-piece propshaft, rear live axle including differential and brakes) to the plant at Termini Imerese where it was fitted to the reinforced bodyshell.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cohort Classic: Fiat Panda 4\u00d74 \u2013 Simply Simple|url=http://www.curbsideclassic.com/curbside-classics-european/cohort-classic-fiat-panda-4x4-simply-brilliant/|work=curbsideclassic.com|accessdate=5 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn November 1984 trim levels were named \"L\", \"CL\", and \"S\". Specifications and detailing were modified across the range, using the Fiat corporate grille on all trims. Mechanically the range remained largely unchanged.\n\n====First facelift====\n[[File:1989 FIAT Panda.jpg|thumb|right|S post-facelift Panda]]\nIn January 1986, the Panda received visual and mechanical revisions \u2014 with many pre- and post-facelift Panda parts incompatible. The facelift version was internally designated '''141A'''.\n\nThe 652 cc air-cooled two-cylinder engine was replaced by a 769&nbsp;cc (34&nbsp;PS) water-cooled four-cylinder unit, and the 903/965cc by a 999&nbsp;cc (45&nbsp;PS, 50&nbsp;PS (37&nbsp;kW) in the 4x4) unit. Both new engines were from Fiat's new [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] family of four-cylinder water-cooled powerplants with a single overhead camshaft. The rear suspension was also upgraded, the rigid axle with leaf springs being replaced by a more modern dependent suspension system known as the \"Omega axle\", consisting of a non-straight rigid axle with a central mounting and coil springs (first seen on the [[Lancia Y10]], which used the same platform). The 4x4 retained the leaf-sprung live axle set-up.\n\nThe body was strengthened and fully galvanised on later models, virtually eliminating the earlier car's notable tendency to rust.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Rear quarter panels received wheel arches mirroring the front fender/wing wheel arches. Front door quarter windows were eliminated. The bottom seam of the facelifted model's doors retained much the earlier car's susceptibility to rust.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The range included 750L, 750CL, 750S, 1000CL, 1000S, 4x4 models.\n\n[[File:Fiat panda 2 sst.jpg|thumb|right|Fiat Panda Van]]\n[[File:1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 SISLEY (3863394372).jpg|thumb|left|1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 Sisley]]\n\nApril 1986 saw the introduction of a 1301&nbsp;cc diesel engine with 37&nbsp;bhp (a detuned 127/Uno unit). Fitted as standard with a five-speed gearbox it was only available in the basic \"L\" trim and was available until 1989 (until 1994 in the van versions).\n\nA van variant of the Panda was introduced, with both petrol and diesel engines. The van elimated rear seats and featured rear windows replaced with plastic blanking panels and a small, black, steel extension with side hinged doors \u2014in lieu of a hatch tailgate. Neither the van nor the diesel were available in right hand drive markets.\n\nIn 1987, an entry-level model badged \"Panda Young\" was added to the range. This was essentially an L spec car with a 769&nbsp;cc OHV engine based on the old 903 cc push-rod [[Fiat 100 series engine|FIAT 100]] engine and producing the same 34&nbsp;bhp (25&nbsp;kW) as the more sophisticated 769&nbsp;cc FIRE unit. The Panda 4x4 Sisley limited edition was also released, based on the standard 4x4, with metallic paint, inclinometer, white painted wheels, roof rack, headlamp washers, bonnet scoop, \"Sisley\" badging and trim. Although originally limited to the production of only 500, in 1989 the Sisley model became a permanent model.\n\n====Panda Elettra====\n[[File:Fiat Panda Elettra 1990.JPG|thumb|left|Panda Elettra in Santiago de Chile, 2010]]\nThe two-seat Panda Elettra, introduced in 1990, added an all-electric power-train to the line. Batteries replaced the rear seats and occupied some of the engine bay where the {{convert|19|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} DC motor was also fitted, driving through the normal clutch and gearbox \u2014 with weight increased to {{convert|1150|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} ({{convert|450|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} over than the standard model, necessitating stiffer suspension and uprated brakes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Toen al groen: Fiat Panda Elettra|url=http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|publisher=FIATblog.nl|accessdate=24 April 2011|language=nl|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310171825/http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|archivedate=10 March 2012}}</ref> 1992 revisions to the Elettra saw the power increased to {{convert|23.8|bhp|abbr=on}}<ref name=elettra /> and the weight reduced, though the Elettra remained significantly heavier than the standard Panda.\nThis, and the steep price (25.600.000 [[Italian lira|lire]] in Italy, three times the price of the Panda 750 Young) made it a commercial failure. The Elettra was discontinued in 1998.\n\n====Second facelift====\n[[File:1997 Fiat Panda.JPG|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n[[File:Fiat Panda rear 20071205.jpg|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n1991, revisions included a front grille with a smaller five-bar corporate badge, as well as revisions to trim and specifications across the range. New arrivals included the 'Selecta', which had a [[continuously variable transmission]] with an electromagnetic clutch. This transmission was available either with the normal 999&nbsp;cc FIRE engine (revised with single-point fuel injection and a [[catalytic converter]]) or an all new 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit, fitted with electronic fuel injection and a three-way catalytic converter and producing {{convert|51|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe new CLX trim also featured a five-speed gearbox as standard. The range now comprised the 750 Young (769&nbsp;cc ohv), 750 and 750 CLX (both 769&nbsp;cc FIRE sohc), 900 Dance (903&nbsp;cc ohv), 1000 Shopping, CLX, CL Selecta and S (all with 999&nbsp;cc sohc, available with or without SPI and catalytic converter depending on the market), 1100 CL Selecta (1108&nbsp;cc sohc with SPI and cat) and the 4x4 Trekking (999&nbsp;cc, again available with and without a cat depending on the market). The Elettra concluded the range.\n\nIn 1992, the 1108&nbsp;cc engine, complete with SPI and catalytic converter, replaced the 999&nbsp;cc unit in the 4x4 (with 50&nbsp;bhp) and also in 1992 an 899&nbsp;cc (with injection and catalyst) became available, in the 'Cafe' special edition. This was a reduced capacity 903&nbsp;cc unit, designed to meet tax requirements in some markets. Non-catalyzed versions were withdrawn about this time.\n\nIn January 2001, the range underwent its final light adjustment. The 4x4 Trekking continued to be available, while front-wheel-drive versions were down to the Young and the Hobby. The 899&nbsp;cc was discontinued and only the Euro&nbsp;3 capable, fuel injected 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit remained available. These Pandas featured a body-coloured flap for the gas tank, rather than the exposed black plastic cap of earlier models.\n\n====End of production====\nThe Panda was discontinued in the UK in 1995.<ref>https://www.exchangeandmart.co.uk/reviews/fiat/panda/2004/209626</ref> The car remained in production in Italy until May 2003. Its total production run of 23 years makes the Fiat Panda one of Europe's longest-lived small cars.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n===SEAT Panda / Marbella===\n[[File:Fiat Panda 1st series pink vl.jpg|thumb|right|SEAT Marbella]]\n[[File:SEATTransfront.jpg|thumb|left|SEAT Trans]]\n{{main|SEAT Marbella}}\nSpanish car maker [[SEAT]] also produced a version of the Panda between 1980 and 1986, based on the first Panda model. It was called '''SEAT Panda'''. SEAT also made a tiny, tall delivery version of the Panda called the SEAT Trans.\n\nUp to 1983, SEAT made rebadged versions of Fiat cars through a [[licence]] agreement between the two firms. Thus, there existed a Spanish version of the Panda. When [[Pope John Paul II]] visited Spain in 1982, he rode in a specially built SEAT Panda.\n\nAfter Fiat sold their share in SEAT and the licence agreement ended, the whole Fiat-based line of SEAT cars were quickly given minor facelifts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The SEAT Panda had its bonnet, bumpers and rear tailgate redesigned. From 1986, when it received a second facelift, it was known as the SEAT Marbella until the end of production in 1998. Emelba also produced a roofless version called the Pandita, which was popular as a rental car in resort areas. The SEAT Trans also received a major facelift and was renamed SEAT Terra.\n\nAs Fiat and SEAT's licensing agreement had expired in 1986 the Marbella never received the major mechanical upgrades of the facelifted Fiat Panda, instead continuing with the old [[pushrod]] Fiat-based engines, quarter light doors, un-galvanised frame and leaf-sprung suspension as for the original model. It was popular in Spain throughout its production life, but was less popular on export markets (where the Fiat version was firm favourite) and by 1996, exports had mostly finished.\n\n===Reception and awards===\nThe first generation Panda met with great success across Europe, polling 2nd in the 1981 [[European Car of the Year]] awards in its first full year of production<ref name=\"caroftheyear.org\">{{cite web | url = http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | title = Previous Cars | accessdate = 29 January 2012 | work = caroftheyear.org | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120101121344/http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | archivedate = 1 January 2012 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> (pipped to first place by the [[Escort xr3i|Ford Escort Mark III]]) and remaining on sale in some regions until May 2003.<ref name=\"panda-marbella.webs.com\">{{cite web|url=http://panda-marbella.webs.com/|title=Fiat Panda|accessdate=24 April 2011|work=panda-marbella.webs.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429011137/http://www.panda-marbella.webs.com/|archivedate=29 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981 Giugiaro received the Italian [[Compasso d'Oro]] [[Associazione per il Disegno Industriale|ADI]] [[industrial design]] [[award]] for the Panda.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,13/articleid,1054_01_1981_0221_0013_18646326/anews,true/ |title=Compasso d'oro alla Fiat Panda |date=13 September 1981 |page=13 |newspaper=[[La Stampa]] |language=it |accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref>\nA less positive reaction to the design came from German magazine [[Der Spiegel]], which in 1980 contrasted Giugiaro defining the Panda as \"the most enchanting work of his life\", and chief designer Felice Cornacchia describing himself as \"proud overall of the car's architecture\" to Peter Glodschey, road tester of mass-market [[Bild]] newspaper, who likened the car to \"a shoe box\".<ref name=\"Spiege071980\">{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-14325284.html|title=Legitimer Erbe: Mit einem neuen Kleinwagen will Italiens gebeutelter Auto-Riese Fiat auf dem deutschen Markt vergraulte Kunden zur\u00fcckgewinnen |quote=Stylist Giorgio Giugiaro: \"F\u00fcr mich war dies die reizvollste Arbeit meines Lebens.\" Chefkonstrukteur Felice Cornacchia: \"Am meisten bin ich stolz auf die Architektur des Wagens.\" Mit einem \"Schuhkarton\" verglich \"Bild\"-Autotester Peter Glodschey den neuen Panda.

Like the smaller [[Fiat Seicento]], the Panda was manufactured only in [[Tychy]], Poland, by [[Fiat Auto Poland]].\n\nThe high-bodied Panda takes styling cues from [[mini MPV]]s and [[mini SUV]]s, especially the second generation [[Fiat Multipla]]. The Panda won the [[European Car of the Year]] award in 2004.\n\nThe Panda includes an option for split rear seats, which makes the Panda a four-seater. Since September 2005, all Pandas are equipped with [[anti-lock braking system|ABS]], [[electronic brakeforce distribution|EBD]] and at least one front airbag. The gear-lever is located high on the central dashboard, which is designed to make changing gears more comfortable than with a conventional floor-mounted gearstick.\n\nFinancially troubled Fiat needed the new Panda to be a success, and it sold half a million units by October 2005. It sells particularly well in Italy (over half of the cars produced are sold in Italy), being seen as closer to a spiritual successor to the [[Fiat 500]] than a replacement for either the Seicento or the old Panda.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n* The 500,000th new Panda was built on 5 October 2005, a light blue Panda Emotion with the 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].\n* The 1,000,000th new Panda was built on 5 September 2007, a red Panda 4x4 Climbing with 1.2-litre petrol engine.<ref name=\"italiaspeed.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2007/cars/fiat/09/panda_1_million/0509.html|date=5 September 2007 |title=One millionth Fiat Panda rolls off the production lines |accessdate=8 September 2007|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 1,500,000th new Panda was built on 21 July 2009, a blue Panda Emotion with 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"www.fiat.pl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2009/cars/fiat/07/panda_15_million/2407.html|date=24 July 2009 |title=Fiat Panda number 1,500,000 rolls off the lines at Tychy|accessdate=28 July 2009|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 2,000,000th new Panda rolled out of factory on 4 July 2011, a red Panda 4x4 Cross with 1.3-litre 75&nbsp;bhp Multijet [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"2-millionth-nuova-Panda\">{{cite web|url=http://italiaspeed.com/2011/cars/fiat/07/panda_2_million/0407.html|date=5 July 2011|title=Two millionth second generation Fiat Panda is built at Tychy|accessdate=5 July 2011|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Top Gear (magazine)|Top Gear]] Motoring Survey in 2006 ranked the Panda 8th out of 152 cars surveyed for reliability, craftsmanship, ownership costs, driving experience and service received.

The 4x4 was offered with 1.2 petrol and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The Panda Cross was no longer manufactured. The Panda Classic was produced through 2012.\n\n===Models===\n* The '''Natural Power''' is a dual-fuel version, it can burn either gasoline or CNG (Compressed Natural Gas a.k.a. methane). Methane results in low emissions and increased fuel economy. The chassis is the same of the 4x4, the space of the rear wheels differential is occupied by two methane tanks allowing over 240&nbsp;km of autonomy on gas only.\n* The basic '''Actual''' has black bumpers, lacks electric windows and a full-size spare wheel. The Actual was introduced in January 2004.\n* The '''Active''', introduced in May 2003, features black self-coloured bumpers and front electric windows, central door locking, [[Vehicle audio|radio/cassette player]], driver's airbag, power steering. Manual climate control is available as an option. Since September 2005, ABS and the front passenger's airbag have been made standard. This model has the 1100&nbsp;cc \"FIRE\" engine and a five-speed gearbox.\n* The '''Active Plus''' edition is an up-equipped ''Active'', with a [[Cassette player|cassette]]/[[CD player]] as standard. Production of the Active Plus stopped in December 2003.\n* The '''Dynamic''' edition features [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]], dual airbags, roof bars, power steering and a [[cassette player]] as standard. A CD & MP3 player, [[CD changer]], alloy wheels, manual or automated [[climate control]], glass sunroof and a semi-automatic transmission are available as options. Since September 2005, four [[airbag]]s have been standard in some countries, with an option for two additional [[Airbags#Side tubular or curtain airbag|side curtain airbags]].\n* The '''Emotion (Eleganza)''' edition is the highest trim level. This particular trim level features significant enhancements over the Dynamic, with a standard CD player, alloy wheels with low profile tires and automated [[climate control]]. In some countries such as the UK, the Emotion is sold as the \"Eleganza\".\n\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Front.jpg\n| image2   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Rear.jpg\n| caption2 = Fiat Panda 100HP\n}}\n* The '''100&nbsp;HP''' edition is the sportiest Panda model. It has the 1.4-litre 16-valve [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] petrol engine from the [[Fiat Punto]] tuned to develop {{convert|100|PS|kW bhp|abbr=on}} through a six-speed manual transmission. It differs from other Pandas by being equipped with 4-wheel disc brakes, tinted windows, and sports styled front and rear bumpers. The Panda 100&nbsp;HP features a unique suspension setup with modified springs, dampers, bushes and compliance giving a considerably firmer ride.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp offers 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h acceleration in 9.5&nbsp;s and a maximum speed of {{convert|185|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with fuel consumption at {{convert|6.5|L/100 km|1|abbr=on}} in the EU combined cycle and 154&nbsp;g/km of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. It was available in black, white, red, metallic blue, and metallic gray while a \"Pandamonium Pack\" which added red disc brakes, decals and colour-coded wing mirrors was an optional extra.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp was introduced in 2006, but due to tightening emissions regulations, Fiat halted its production in July 2010.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n* The '''4x4 Climbing''' edition, introduced in December 2004, has a higher ride height and larger wheels and tires than other editions. The [[four-wheel drive]] system also makes this edition slower than others. Features are similar to those found in the Dynamic. The Climbing, however, lacks a differential lock and transmission with reductor. The Climbing edition can be distinguished by a slightly higher suspension, additional black plastic overlays on the bumpers and a \"Climbing\" badge just below the \"Panda\" badge on the left side of the rear licence plate. Swedish magazine Vi Bil\u00e4gare found in a test 2007 that Panda 4x4 is a good and economical choice for a small family who need a car with four-wheel drive.\n* The '''Cross''' edition, similar to the Climbing, features differently shaped front and rear lights and additional side cladding. Unlike the Climbing, the Cross does have a differential lock. The Cross edition became available in January 2006 in [[Italy]] and was also available in other markets including right-hand drive.\n\nThe Actual and Active are also bases for the '''Actual Van''' and '''Active Van''', which can be used as small vans (they also have an additional safety net behind the front seats and removable rear seats). These versions can be identified by small \"Van\" label on the back door.\n\nDuring the time, many limited editions of Panda (Active and Dynamic editions only) were produced. Each of them had additional interior fittings, differentiating them from the base model.\n\n===Prototypes and special editions===\n* The '''360 Special Series''', based on the 1.2 L Dynamic, is distinguished by a black and white crosshair style logo on the B pillar. Other upgraded features include; 14&nbsp;inch alloy wheels, metallic paint, special interior trim (including the Fiat brand on the front seats), built in bluetooth phone system, CD player, air conditioning and a split folding rear seat. Other more standard features include; electric windows, central locking system and dual speed power steering. The total of all these extras comes somewhere in the region of \u00a31,600 but surprisingly the upgraded 360 model actually retails at roughly \u00a3400 less than the Dynamic model. On the safety side of things, it comes with anti lock brakes and brake assist as well as two airbags as standard (driver and passenger) with the option of adding an extra four airbags taking the total up to six.\n* '''Fiat Panda Alessi'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda II Alessi 001.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Alessi]]\nItalian Design house [[Alessi (Italian company)|Alessi]] created a special edition featuring a two-tone paint scheme and unique trim inside and out. Fiat gave away some of Alessi's products (coffee machine and tin-can openers) for the special model's debut at the Ideal Home Show in the UK. The rims feature the ''Girotondo'' family accents.\n* '''Fiat Panda Jolly'''\nThe Fiat Panda Jolly was created by Fiat Styling Center and Stola and inspired by boat design. It served as a special shuttle bus in Capri during the summer of 2006. The interior features innovative materials and exclusive trims. The concept mainly came from the 600 Multipla Jolly, a car created by Carrozzeria Ghia in 1956, which could be found on the streets of Capri 50 years ago. Defined by Fiat as \"a car with a fresh, light and Mediterranean look both in the colors and materials\", the Panda Jolly is inspired by the interior design and yacht design worlds, and features styling elements that remind of the spirit and way of life of the 1960s.\n\nThe interiors are created by Paola Lenti, an Italian leading company in the Interior Design sector, specialized in the research and development of innovative fabrics and materials. All the seats are upholstered in the exclusive sailing-inspired Rope fabric. This material is nonallergic, nontoxic, antibacterial and resistant to UV rays. Many structural elements like the floor, sills and various trims are made with pickled natural ash finish with white ash inlays.\n* '''Fiat Panda Terramare 4'''\nPanda Terramare's creator is Milan born Maurizio Zanisi, an independent former [[Iso Rivolta]] engineer, and his self-built amphibian is based on a Panda 4x4 chassis, but with an inflatable flotation belt, and waterjet propulsion driven off the rear axle.\n\nOn 21 July 2006, the Terramare crossed the [[English Channel]] from [[Folkestone]] in Kent to [[Cap Gris Nez]] in just over 6 hours.<ref name=terramare>{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2006/07/21/fiat-panda-marine-edition/ |title=Fiat Panda Terramare 4 makes it across the English Channel |accessdate=15 February 2009 |work=autoblog.com }}</ref>\n* '''Fiat Panda Luxury'''\nAt the 'Luxury & Yachts' show in February 2006, Fiat exhibited a one-off car based on the 4x4 called the 'Luxury'. The outside of the car features dipped silver paintwork, precious metal trim and gleaming jewel-like mouldings with back-lit inset crystals. The interior features dipped silver appointments, precious metal details, Jewel Alcantara upholstery and leather with mother of pearl finish. The Fiat logo is also worked on the seats with stylish studs and crystals.\n* '''Fiat Panda Hydrogen'''\n[[File:FiatPandaHydrogen1.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Hydrogen]]\n{{main|Fiat Panda Hydrogen}}\n\nThe Panda Hydrogen, a prototype driven by a hydrogen Fuel Cell, was a joint venture between Fiat Auto, the Fiat Research Centre and Fiat Powertrain Research & Technology with the support of the Research and Environment Ministries.\n\nOn the Panda Hydrogen, the Fuel Cell System is housed beneath the floorpan. The fuel cells are made up of several cells connected in series. Inside, the hydrogen and oxygen molecules are forced to react with the aid of a catalyst to produce water and heat. Electrical energy is generated with very high efficiency and zero emissions from the vehicle itself.\n\nAt full power, the Fuel Cell engine on the Panda Hydrogen delivers {{convert|60|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} that allows the car to reach a top speed of more than {{convert|130|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with acceleration from 0 to {{convert|50|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} in 5 seconds. The car can also easily climb a gradient of 23% at take-off.\n\nDuring 2006 a demonstration stage of small Panda Hydrogen fleets, was a forerunner to other demonstration programs promoted and supported by the European Union and by the Italian Ministries and Regions. The aim is for such vehicles to be marketed within 15 to 20 years.\n* '''Fiat Panda Tanker'''\nUnveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in Italy, the Panda Tanker features only three doors. And although the overall shape has remained unchanged, the two rear doors have been replaced by solid panels to free up some extra load space in the practical cabin.\nRugged extras and underbody protection also help to set the Tanker apart from the standard Panda 4x4 model. Designed in conjunction with Italian [[extreme sport]] clothing manufacturer Dainese, the show star is equipped with sports seats incorporating a rigid titanium fibre shell.\n\nReflecting the matt paint finish of the exterior, the cabin has a back-to-basics feel. With no rear seats, the load floor offers flexible attachments for fixing sports kit, while an aluminium structure is designed to carry mountain bikes.\n* '''Fiat Panda MultiEco'''\nThe Panda MultiEco show-car made its world debut in Geneva 2006. Fiat sees this unit as the future of cars with a low environmental impact: the concept car represents the most advanced frontier achievable in terms of emissions and consumption, combining technologies that already exist or are ready for production.\n\nThe show-car combines an innovative 'powertrain' architecture&nbsp;\u2013 an engine with dual petrol/methane fuel supply, MTA transmission and BAS device&nbsp;\u2013 with the use of eco-compatible materials (recycled, recyclable or of natural origin) for the exterior and interior. The result is made even more interesting by the painstaking optimisation of the aerodynamics and a significant weight reduction.\n\nPanda MultiEco is equipped with a dual-fuel (methane and petrol) FIRE engine&nbsp;\u2013 future developments will also make it possible to use a methane/hydrogen mix&nbsp;\u2013 combined with a BAS (Belt-driven Alternator-Starter) device and a Dualogic robotised gearbox.\n* '''Fiat PanDAKAR'''\nTwo factory-built Fiat Panda 4x4s were prepared to contest the gruelling [[Dakar 2007]] rally raid, which started in Lisbon.\n\nEntered in the T2 category, the class which most closely represents production vehicles, the two Panda 4x4s, driven by [[Miki Biasion]] and former Dakar winner, [[Bruno Saby]], respectively, are powered by Fiat Auto's 1.3-litre Multijet turbodiesel combined with a six-speed manual gearbox. The engines deliver {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4,500&nbsp;rpm and a peak torque of {{convert|123|lbft|Nm|1|abbr=on}}. at 2,500&nbsp;rpm. Apart from their small dimensions, the two cars are particularly noteworthy for their automatic all-wheel drive system with viscous coupling and locking differential, a system that provides more grip and traction on rough and soft terrain thanks to the optimal split of drive to the wheels.\n\nThe two Pandas competing in Dakar 2007 have been equipped specifically for this rally: so room has been found inside for accessories like aluminium platforms to help extricate the vehicles from soft sand, shovels, spare wheels, water reserves for the crew, and other specialised equipment useful for the occasion. The Fiat expedition to Dakar included a Fiat Sedici as service back-up, and three Iveco trucks to transport spares and technicians.\n\nBoth PanDAKAR retired on the fourth stage of the event.\n* '''Fiat Panda Simba'''\nThe Simba was unveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in 2002 as a concept car to give an idea how the following year's production Panda would look. Some of the rugged styling cues made it on the production '''Cross''' model.\n* '''Fiat Panda Aria'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda Aria 3.jpeg|thumb|Fiat Panda Aria]]\nFiat presented Aria concept in Frankfurt Motor Show 2007. The Aria is equipped with new environment-friendly technology and outputs only 69 g/km [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]]. With 900&nbsp;cc turbocharged [[Straight-twin engine|straight-2]] engine it produces {{convert|80|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, it is also capable of using both petrol and CNG.\n\nThis new engine is equipped with Fiat's Multiair technology, which uses electrohydraulic valve activation system. In monofuel (petrol) version the engine is capable of producing {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The car is also equipped with Stop&Start function, which helps to reduce consumption by 10% in urban driving.<ref name=\"worldcarfans.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/9070903.005/fiat-panda-aria-concept-debut|title=Fiat Panda Aria Concept Debut|accessdate=23 September 2007|work=worldcarfans.com}}</ref>\n\n===Engines===\nThe smallest engine, the 1.1&nbsp;L petrol [[SOHC]] [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine, which is rated at {{convert|54|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and found in the [[Fiat Seicento]], has been criticised{{whom|date=November 2019}} for being underpowered for the Panda, which weighs over {{convert|850|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}, and the acceleration in particular was considered to be very slow. This engine is a construction from the early 1980s.\n\nThe 1.2-litre (actually 1,242&nbsp;cc), {{convert|60|hp|abbr=on}} engine is a derivative of the 1.1 litre, but with higher torque.\n\nThe 1.3-litre [[Multijet]] diesel engine is rated at {{convert|75|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|100|lbft|Nm|-1|abbr=on}} of torque; it is the most economical of all available engines. However, this engine is detuned from the [[Fiat Punto|Punto]] (where it develops {{convert|120|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque) due to the Panda's weaker transmission. Pandas with diesel engines can be easily distinguished by a \"Multijet\" badge on the right side of the rear licence plate.\n\nIntroduced into the range in 2006 was the 1368&nbsp;cc [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine which had previously seen service in the Fiat Stilo and the second generation Punto Sporting (contrary to some press reports, it is not an adapted version of the 1.4 16v Starjet engine used in the Grande Punto). This [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine has four cylinders in-line with sixteen valves actuated by belt driven double overhead camshafts.\n\nThe engine is [[undersquare]] with bore and stroke of {{convert|72|and|84|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} respectively, running at a compression ratio of 10.8:1.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:91%;\"\n|-\n!
