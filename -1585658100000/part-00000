By the end of the conflict he had established himself and his descendants as Clanricarde, also known as the Mac William Uachtar (Upper Mac William), independent lords of Galway. He was succeeded by his son, [[Richard \u00d3g Burke]].\n\n==Family background==\n\nThere are differing views as to Burke's ancestry.  \n\nAccording to the [[Book of the de Burgos|Book of the Burkes]] (''Historia et Genealogia Familiae de Burgo''), a genealogical manuscript made in the 1570s for [[Sea\u00e1n mac Oliver Bourke]] of the Burkes of County Mayo, Burke was a son of Richard an Fhorbhair mac William de Burgh, a natural son of William Laith de Burgh, who was a son of [[Richard \u00d3g de Burgh]], illegitimate son of William de Burgh (d. 1205) original founder of the de Burgh/Burke dynasty in Ireland.<ref name=\"blake_1911\">{{cite journal | journal=Journal of the Galway Archaeological and Historical Society | volume=VII | title=Notes on the Persons Named in the Obituary Book of the Franciscan Abbey at Galway | first=Martin J | last=Blake | author-link1=Martin J.

[[Oxford University Press]], p.&nbsp;170.</ref>  This volume has been used as the basis for the family tree below.\n\nOn this view, Burke would have been the leader of an illegitimate branch of the de Burgh family that were already strong in south Connaught, and were able to use the conflict of the 1330s to establish themselves as an independent lordship.  The name \"Clanricarde\", first recorded in 1335, would reflect their ancestry from [[Richard \u00d3g de Burgh]], and might have already been in informal use for a number of generations.\n\nHowever, as noted by [[Martin J. Blake]] in 1911,<ref name=\"blake_1911\" /> the pedigree above is not without its problems.  In particular, William Liath de Burgh, the founder of the Franciscan Abbey in Galway, is known to have died in 1324. As Blake writes \"it is obvious, having regard to these dates, that he could hardly have been a grandson (as these writers represent him to be) of the first William de Burgh in Ireland, who died early in A.D. 1206 as the English State Records prove.\"  The MacFirbis pedigree also omits Burke's successor Richard \u00d3g Burke, whose existence is well attested.  Blake concludes that MacFirbis and the earlier manuscript \"are accurate as regards the genealogy they give of the Mac William Bourkes of Mayo (Mac William Eighter) but that they had no accurate information regarding the early part of the pedigree of the Mac William Burkes of Clan-Ricard (Mac William Oughter) and could only make a guess at it\u2013with the not surprising result, that they made a mess of it.\"<ref name=\"blake_1911\" />\n\nA different ancestry for Burke was given by [[John Lodge (archivist)|John Lodge]] in his ''Peerage of Ireland'' (2nd ed, 1789),<ref>[[John Lodge (archivist)|John Lodge]] and [[Mervyn Archdall (Irish antiquary)|Mervyn Archdall]] (1789) ''The peerage of Ireland: or, A genealogical history of the present nobility of that kingdom'', 2nd edition. Vol 1, p. [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=H0sTAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA127&lpg=PA127 127].<br />The information then also appeared in various derived and knock-off works, such as W. Owen (1790), ''The Peerage of England, Scotland, and Ireland. Volume III: The peerage of Ireland'', p. [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zjAwAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA1-PA9 9]<br />Compare also eg [[James Hardiman]] (1820), ''The History of the Town and County of the Town of Galway'', p.

(1st edition, p.

[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QK-4tHp4dzgC&pg=PA78&lpg=PA78 78]<br />The ancestry also appears in other reference works of this period, for example George Crabb (1833), ''Universal historical dictionary'', Vol. I, p. [https://archive.org/details/universalhistori10crab/page/n523/mode/1up 524]</ref>  \n\nAccording to this version William Liath de Burgh was identical with the William de Burgh who was the son of [[William \u00d3g de Burgh]], that died at the [[Battle of \u00c1th an gCeap]] in 1270,<ref>cf also the [[Annals of the Four Masters]], which contain the record that \"William Liath Burke, son of William Mor, died\".</ref> and father of [[Walter Liath de Burgh]], whose starving to death in 1332 triggered the Burke civil war.  On this view William Liath de Burgh was the dominant Anglo-Norman noble in all Connaught, second in authority only to his cousin [[Richard \u00d3g de Burgh, 2nd Earl of Ulster]] among the de Burghs.  Ulick de Burgh is presented as the son of William Liath de Burgh, and so brother to [[Edmond Albanach de Burgh]] and Walter de Burgh, with Ulick and Edmond ultimately partitioning Connaught between themselves at the end of the conflict as brothers.  Blake asserts that the Burke who was a son of Richard an Fhorbhair should be identified with [[Ulick Burke of Umhaill]], ancestor of the Bourkes of the Owles, in County Mayo.<ref name=\"blake_1911\" />\n\n==The First ''Clanricarde''==\n\nOn the death of [[Richard \u00d3g de Burgh, 2nd Earl of Ulster]] in 1326, the earldom passed to his grandson [[William Donn de Burgh, 3rd Earl of Ulster]], then 14 years old.  William became increasingly estranged and suspicious of his two principal lieutenants, Henry de Mandeville in Ulster and Walter de Burgh in Connaught.  In 1331 he had Henry de Mandeville arrested, and the following year he had Walter de Burgh with two of his brothers captured and imprisoned. He then ordered that Walter should be starved to death.  [[Gylle de Burgh]], the sister of Walter and wife of Robert de Mandeville, Henry's brother, plotted revenge and in June 1333 the young Earl was cut down as he passed through [[Carrickfergus]] by members of his own retinue, members and associates of the de Mandeville family.\n\nThis action triggered [[Burke Civil War|open civil war]] between the different branches of the de Burgh family. The Earl's heir-general, his infant daughter, [[Elizabeth de Burgh, 4th Countess of Ulster]], was taken to England on her father's death and lost control over her lands. Warfare broke out among the [[Gaels|Gaelic]]-[[Irish people|Irish]] tenants of the late Earl \u2013 many of whom expelled the [[Anglo-Irish]] \u2013 and among the three principal members of the de Burgh family:\n\n* [[Edmond de Burgh]] of [[Castleconnell]] (now in [[County Limerick]]), surviving brother of the second Earl, senior member of the Earl's direct family.\n* [[Edmond Albanach de Burgh]] of north [[Connacht]] (mainly [[County Mayo]])\n* Ulick Burke of Annaghkeen in south Connacht (mainly east [[County Galway]])\n\nA series of raids and counter-raids ensued, with Edmond de Burgh reportedly laying waste much of Connaught in 1335.  But in 1338 Edmond de Burgh was cornered and caught at [[Ballinrobe]] by his cousin Edmond Albanach, who according to the [[Annals of the Four Masters]] \"fastened a stone to his neck and drowned him in [[Lough Mask]]\".\n\nIn the aftermath by 1340 the much-weakened family had divided into three separate, independent lordships:\n\n* [[Clanwilliam (County Limerick)|Clanwilliam]] Burke of [[County Limerick]]\n* [[Mac William \u00cdochtar]] of [[County Mayo]]\n* [[Clanricarde]] of [[County Galway]]\n\nUlick remained Clanricarde until his death in 1343 (or 1353 ?<ref name=\"blake_1911\" />), to be succeeded by his son, [[Richard \u00d3g Burke]].\n\nHe is said to have possessed an unusual nickname \u2014 ''Bod-an-Balcuigh'', which translated to \"Penis of Power\".{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\n==Family tree==\n(based on the Oxford ''A New History of Ireland'', volume IX, (1984)).\n\n   Walter de Burgh\n   |\n   |____________________________________________\n   |                                           |\n   |                                           |\n  [[William de Burgh]], died 1205.

As Blake writes \"it is obvious, having regard to these dates, that he could hardly have been a grandson (as these writers represent him to be) of the first William de Burgh in Ireland, who died early in A.D. 1206 as the English State Records prove.\"  The MacFirbis pedigree also omits Burke's successor Richard \u00d3g Burke, whose existence is well attested.  Blake concludes that MacFirbis and the earlier manuscript \"are accurate as regards the genealogy they give of the Mac William Bourkes of Mayo (Mac William Eighter) but that they had no accurate information regarding the early part of the pedigree of the Mac William Burkes of Clan-Ricard (Mac William Oughter) and could only make a guess at it\u2013with the not surprising result, that they made a mess of it.\"<ref name=\"blake_1911\" />\n\nA different ancestry for Burke was given by [[John Lodge (archivist)|John Lodge]] in his ''Peerage of Ireland'' (2nd ed, 1789),<ref>[[John Lodge (archivist)|John Lodge]] and [[Mervyn Archdall (Irish antiquary)|Mervyn Archdall]] (1789) ''The peerage of Ireland: or, A genealogical history of the present nobility of that kingdom'', 2nd edition.

On this view William Liath de Burgh was the dominant Anglo-Norman noble in all Connaught, second in authority only to his cousin [[Richard \u00d3g de Burgh, 2nd Earl of Ulster]] among the de Burghs.  Ulick de Burgh is presented as the son of William Liath de Burgh, and so brother to [[Edmond Albanach de Burgh]] and Walter de Burgh, with Ulick and Edmond ultimately partitioning Connaught between themselves at the end of the conflict as brothers.  Blake asserts that the Burke who was a son of Richard an Fhorbhair should be identified with [[Ulick Burke of Umhaill]], ancestor of the Bourkes of the Owles, in County Mayo.<ref name=\"blake_1911\" />\n\n==The First ''Clanricarde''==\n\nOn the death of [[Richard \u00d3g de Burgh, 2nd Earl of Ulster]] in 1326, the earldom passed to his grandson [[William Donn de Burgh, 3rd Earl of Ulster]], then 14 years old.  William became increasingly estranged and suspicious of his two principal lieutenants, Henry de Mandeville in Ulster and Walter de Burgh in Connaught.  In 1331 he had Henry de Mandeville arrested, and the following year he had Walter de Burgh with two of his brothers captured and imprisoned. He then ordered that Walter should be starved to death.  [[Gylle de Burgh]], the sister of Walter and wife of Robert de Mandeville, Henry's brother, plotted revenge and in June 1333 the young Earl was cut down as he passed through [[Carrickfergus]] by members of his own retinue, members and associates of the de Mandeville family.\n\nThis action triggered [[Burke Civil War|open civil war]] between the different branches of the de Burgh family. The Earl's heir-general, his infant daughter, [[Elizabeth de Burgh, 4th Countess of Ulster]], was taken to England on her father's death and lost control over her lands. Warfare broke out among the [[Gaels|Gaelic]]-[[Irish people|Irish]] tenants of the late Earl \u2013 many of whom expelled the [[Anglo-Irish]] \u2013 and among the three principal members of the de Burgh family:\n\n* [[Edmond de Burgh]] of [[Castleconnell]] (now in [[County Limerick]]), surviving brother of the second Earl, senior member of the Earl's direct family.\n* [[Edmond Albanach de Burgh]] of north [[Connacht]] (mainly [[County Mayo]])\n* Ulick Burke of Annaghkeen in south Connacht (mainly east [[County Galway]])\n\nA series of raids and counter-raids ensued, with Edmond de Burgh reportedly laying waste much of Connaught in 1335.  But in 1338 Edmond de Burgh was cornered and caught at [[Ballinrobe]] by his cousin Edmond Albanach, who according to the [[Annals of the Four Masters]] \"fastened a stone to his neck and drowned him in [[Lough Mask]]\".\n\nIn the aftermath by 1340 the much weakened family had divided into three separate, independent lordships:\n\n* [[Clanwilliam (County Limerick)|Clanwilliam]] Burke of [[County Limerick]]\n* [[Mac William \u00cdochtar]] of [[County Mayo]]\n* [[Clanricarde]] of [[County Galway]]\n\nUlick remained Clanricarde until his death in 1343 (or 1353 ?<ref name=\"blake_1911\" />), to be succeeded by his son, [[Richard \u00d3g Burke]].\n\nHe is said to have possessed an unusual nickname \u2014 ''Bod-an-Balcuigh'', which translated to \"Penis of Power\".{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\n==Family tree==\n(based on the Oxford ''A New History of Ireland'', volume IX, (1984)).\n\n   Walter de Burgh\n   |\n   |____________________________________________\n   |                                           |\n   |                                           |\n  [[William de Burgh]], died 1205.

They criticized the shrinking participation of the national industry in the GDP.<ref name=\"book\" />\n\nRousseff, the next president, decided to hear the demands. The New Economic Matrix was an attempt to help the national industry become more competitive against foreign competition. These measures included tax exemptions and subsidies. However, the industry didn't react.

They were related to \"faulty local macroeconomic measures that went wrong\" [sic], according to [[Gustavo Franco]], former president of the [[Central Bank of Brazil]], who claimed that the cause was entirely self-inflicted.<ref>{{cite web|title=A crise brasileira n\u00e3o vem de fora, ela foi autoinfligida|url=https://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2015/03/25/economia/1427322429_883162.html|work=El Pa\u00eds |date=27 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nThese measures together are known as the ''{{ill|Nova Matriz Econ\u00f4mica|pt|Nova Matriz Econ\u00f4mica|vertical-align=sup}}'' (loosely translated as \"New Economic Matrix\"). Previously, the government had played a major role in the expansion of the internal market by stimulating consumption, raise in the national minimum wage, wealth transfer, and credit expansion. However, by the end of Lula's administration, the view that this strategy was unsustainable grew, mainly among entrepreneurs and industrialists. They criticized the shrinking participation of the national industry in the GDP.<ref name=\"book\" />\n\nRousseff, the next president, decided to hear the demands. The New Economic Matrix was an attempt to help the national industry become more competitive against foreign competition. These measures included tax exemptions and subsidies. However, the industry didn't react. Productivity, which had grown by 2.7% in 2010, fell by 0.9% and 3.7% in the next two years, which damaged government revenues, and, therefore, public investments.<ref name=\"book\" />\n\n=== Political instability ===\nIn the same year the crisis began, a major corruption scheme was discovered and was being investigated in the [[Operation Car Wash]], which involved top politicians and huge companies, such as the oil giant [[Petrobras]].

According to Hull\u2019s concept, the animal turns right in a T-maze after it has already turned left, as turning left the first time diminished the value of the tendency to do so again <ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref>Ryan, R.

(1939). Spontaneous alternation in rats as an indicator of the persistence of stimulus effects. ''Journal of Comparative Psychology'', ''28''(2), 305\u2013312. <nowiki>https://doi.org/doi.org/10.1037/h0056494</nowiki></ref>.These experiments point towards ''perception, attention, memory'' and ''motivation'' as psychological processes which produce SAB.\n\n'''Perception''': The pursuit of directional movement relies on the subject\u2019s manner of gathering information from its surroundings<ref name=\":2\" />.\n\n'''Attention''': The subject selectively abstracts cues from the greater informational environment, informing their concentrative focus and influencing behaviour <ref name=\":2\" />.\n\n'''Memory''': In order to demonstrate a consistent alternating pattern in behaviour, the cues which are attended to and perceived from the first arm of the maze must be stored and retrieved for the pursuit of the alternate arm to be initiated<ref name=\":2\" />.\n\n'''Motivation''': As movement into either arm of the maze isn\u2019t traced, nor reinforced, the animal must have a purpose which is fulfilled by SAB that is not exclusively cognitive. Experimental research suggests that the behaviour is underpinned by an innate drive towards exploring that which is unfamiliar, or less familiar than the other alternative/s<ref name=\":2\" />. Dember and Earl (1957) describe this to be \u2018a manifestation of exploratory motivation\u2019 within their general theory of exploration and curiosity<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref>Dember, W. N., & Earl, R. W. (1957). Analysis of exploratory, manipulatory, and curiosity behaviors. ''Psychological Review'', ''64''(2), 91\u201396. <nowiki>https://doi.org/10.1037/h0046861</nowiki></ref>. The implied hardwiring of the behaviour in the brain draws on the concept of evolutionary psychology. Estes and Schoeffler (1955) proposed that SAB originated as an adaptive behaviour which enabled animals to gather information related to the distribution of resources needed for survival (e.g. food and shelter). With this logic, an animal is likely motivated to enter environments in an alternating pattern because they will have already exhausted the resources from that which they most recently visited<ref name=\":2\" />.\n\n==='''Spontaneous Alternation and Spatial Working Memory'''===\nThere is a comprehensive amount of research which suggests that efficient spatial alternation behaviour requires optimal spatial working memory <ref name=\":3\">Lewis, S. A., Negelspach, D. C., Kaladchibachi, S., Cowen, S. L., & Fernandez, F. (2017). Spontaneous alternation: A potential gateway to spatial working memory in Drosophila. ''Neurobiology of Learning and Memory'', ''142'', 230\u2013235. <nowiki>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nlm.2017.05.013</nowiki></ref>. \n\nSpatial working memory refers to the ability to retain spatial information (in the form of \u00a0environmental cues) in working memory, where it is stored temporarily and elicited actively during the completion of a task<ref>van Asselen, M., Kessels, R. P., Neggers, S. F., Kappelle, L. J., Frijns, C. J., & Postma, A. (2005). Brain areas involved in spatial working memory. ''Neuropsychologia'', ''44''(7), 1185\u20131194. <nowiki>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2005.10.005</nowiki></ref>.This allows one to build, and continuously update, cognitive spatial maps of novel environments as they are being explored, so that they are able to return to areas which they distinguish as less familiar \u2013 thereby optimising information gathering strategies<ref name=\":3\" />.\n\nTherefore, in tests where SAB is reduced, there is an indication of impairment in spatial working memory, seeing as one\u2019s ability to distinguish where they have or have not been is diminished <ref>Li, B., Arime, Y., Hall, F. S., & Uhl, G. R. (2009). Impaired spatial working memory and decreased frontal cortex BDNF protein level in dopamine transporter knockout mice. ''European Journal of Pharmocology'', ''628''(1\u20133), 104\u2013107. <nowiki>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2009.11.036</nowiki></ref>. Hence, spontaneous alternation tests are useful in investigating spatial working memory and the factors which may influence it.\n\nAgeing was found to be a factor which influences SAB. Spontaneous alternation testing with a Y-maze found that the frequency of the behaviour reduces with age in mice at 9- and 12- months<ref name=\":4\">Lamberty, Y., & Gower, A. J. (1990). Age-related changes in spontaneous behavior and learning in NMRI mice from maturity to middle age. ''Physiology & Behavior'', ''47''(6), 1137\u20131144. <nowiki>https://doi.org/10.1016/0031-9384(90)90364-A</nowiki></ref>. Variation in physiological ability (e.g. motor function) did not account for this, instead the observations were attributed to gradual degradation in spatial learning<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\" />. Anatomical changes to limbic and non-limbic pathways associated with normal and pathological ageing in rodents correlate with the decrease in SAB. These include the neurochemical pathways in the [[hippocampus]] and [[basal forebrain]]\u2013 both associated with spatial working memory and learning in humans, as well as in rodents . These findings may suggest a decrease in exploratory behaviour as a result of associated neurobiological changes which implicate the capacity and function of spatial working memory<ref>Adel\u00f6f, J., Ross, M., Lazic, S., Zetterberg, M., Wiseman, J., & Hernebring, M. (2019). Conclusions from a behavioral aging study on male and female F2 hybrid mice on age-related behavior, buoyancy in water-based tests, and an ethical method to assess lifespan.''Aging'', ''11''(17), 7150\u20137168. <nowiki>https://doi.org/10.18632/aging.102242</nowiki></ref>.<br />\n\n==='''Apparatus Design and Test Calculations'''===\nThe apparatus used for spontaneous alternation testing takes multiple forms \u2013 the [[T-maze]] and the Y-maze being those which are most commonly used in experimental psychology. Both apparatus are named to mimic the maze shapes which they portray<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref>''Y Maze Spontaneous Alternation Test''. (n.d.). [TLD]. Stanford Medicine. Retrieved 22 March 2020, from <nowiki>https://med.stanford.edu/sbfnl/services/bm/lm/y-maze.html</nowiki></ref>. The rat is placed in the middle of the maze and is allowed to move freely through each arm. Variations in apparatus (e.g. shape, material, incline etc.) can result in subtle changes to the rate of SAB, though the general behavioural pattern persists<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\nSAB can be evaluated as a percentage indicating how frequently spontaneous alternation is observed across several trials. There are three outputs of the spontaneous alternation test<ref>Ohno, M., Sametsky, E. A., Younkin, L. H., Oakley, H., Younkin, S. G., Citron, M., Vassar, R., & Disterhoft, J. F. (2004). BACE1 deficiency rescues memory deficits and cholinergic dysfunction in a mouse model of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. ''Neuron'', ''41''(1), 27\u201333. <nowiki>https://doi.org/10.1016/S0896-6273(03)00810-9</nowiki></ref>. One output is the number of entries one makes into each arm of the maze \u2013 one entry being defined by when the hind paws of the subject species crosses the boundary distinguishing one arm completely. Another output is the number of alternations the animal makes \u2013 one alternation being the number of consecutive entries into each arm of the maze without any repeats in any order. These are then put into the following equation to yield percentage alternation: \n\n<math>\\%Alternations=100\\left ( \\frac{Number\\ of \\ Alternations}{Number \\ of \\ Entries} \\right )</math>\n\n\nThe cognition of the animal can be assessed based on the score where a lower score is considered cognitively impaired. Chance is determined by the number of arms the maze has, in a three-arm maze it is 22%, in a four-arm or plus maze it is around 9%.\n\n=== '''Criticisms''' ===\n'''Animal Models:''' As a method predominantly used in studies involving non-human animals, there are inherent criticisms which arise from the extent to which findings can extend towards humans in comparative psychology <ref>Bracken, M. B. (2008). Why animal studies are often poor predictors of human reactions to exposure. ''Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine'', ''102''(3), 120\u2013122. <nowiki>https://doi.org/10.1258/jrsm.2008.08k033</nowiki></ref>. While the spontaneous alternation test was designed to gain insight into human cognition and behaviour, its direct replication using human subjects is rarely conducted. Life-sized mazes are impractical to create and lack naturalism in their implementation, eliciting a number of confounding variables related to social desirability and demand characteristics.

''Journal of Comparative Physiological Psychology'', ''62,''171-183.<nowiki>https://doi.org/10.1037/h0023668</nowiki></ref>.\n\n'''Motivation''': As movement into either arm of the maze isn\u2019t traced, nor reinforced, the animal must have a purpose which is fulfilled by SAB that is not exclusively cognitive. Experimental research suggests that the behaviour is underpinned by an innate drive<ref>Kraeuter, A. K., Guest, P. C., & Sarnyai, Z. (2018).

Dember and Earl (1957) describe this to be \u2018a manifestation of exploratory motivation\u2019 within their general theory of exploration and curiosity<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref>Dember, W.

The implied hardwiring of the behaviour in the brain draws on the concept of evolutionary psychology. Estes and Schoeffler (1955) proposed that SAB originated as an adaptive behaviour which enabled animals to gather information related to the distribution of resources needed for survival (e.g. food and shelter)<ref>Estes, W. K., & Schoeffler, M. S. (1955). Analysis of variables influencing alternation after forced trials. ''Journal of Comparative and Physiological Psychology'', ''48''(5), 357\u2013362. <nowiki>https://doi.org/10.1037/h0043836</nowiki></ref>. With this logic, an animal is likely motivated to enter environments in an alternating pattern because they will have already exhausted the resources from that which they most recently visited<ref name=\":2\" />.\n\n==='''Spontaneous Alternation and Spatial Working Memory'''===\nThere is a comprehensive amount of research which suggests that efficient spatial alternation behaviour requires optimal spatial working memory <ref>Sutherland, N.

(1978).''The Hippocampus as a Cognitive Map''. Oxford University Press. <nowiki>https://repository.arizona.edu/handle/10150/620894</nowiki></ref>.\n\nTherefore, in tests where SAB is reduced, there is an indication of impairment in spatial working memory, seeing as one\u2019s ability to distinguish where they have or have not been is diminished <ref>Li, B., Arime, Y., Hall, F. S., & Uhl, G. R. (2009). Impaired spatial working memory and decreased frontal cortex BDNF protein level in dopamine transporter knockout mice.

Hence, spontaneous alternation tests are useful in investigating spatial working memory and the factors which may influence it.\n\nAgeing was found to be a factor which influences SAB. Spontaneous alternation testing with a Y-maze found that the frequency of the behaviour reduces with age in mice at 9- and 12- months<ref name=\":4\">Lamberty, Y., & Gower, A. J. (1990).

Both apparatus are named to mimic the maze shapes which they portray<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref>''Y Maze Spontaneous Alternation Test''. (n.d.). [TLD]. Stanford Medicine. Retrieved 22 March 2020, from <nowiki>https://med.stanford.edu/sbfnl/services/bm/lm/y-maze.html</nowiki></ref>. The rat is placed in the middle of the maze and is allowed to move freely through each arm. Variations in apparatus (e.g. shape, material, incline etc.) can result in subtle changes to the rate of SAB, though the general behavioural pattern persists<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\nSAB can be evaluated as a percentage indicating how frequently spontaneous alternation is observed across several trials<ref>Prieur, E., & Jadavji, N. (2019). Assessing Spatial Working Memory Using the Spontaneous Alternation Y-maze Test in Aged Male Mice. ''Bio-Protocol''. <nowiki>https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.3162</nowiki></ref>. There are three outputs of the spontaneous alternation test<ref>Ohno, M., Sametsky, E. A., Younkin, L. H., Oakley, H., Younkin, S. G., Citron, M., Vassar, R., & Disterhoft, J. F. (2004).

One output is the number of entries one makes into each arm of the maze \u2013 one entry being defined by when the hind paws of the subject species crosses the boundary distinguishing one arm completely. Another output is the number of alternations the animal makes \u2013 one alternation being the number of consecutive entries into each arm of the maze without any repeats in any order. These are then put into the following equation to yield percentage alternation: \n\n\n\n<math>\\%Alternations=100\\left ( \\frac{Number\\ of \\ Alternations}{Number \\ of \\ Entries} \\right )</math>\n\nThe cognition of the animal can be assessed based on the score where a lower score is considered cognitively impaired. Chance is determined by the number of arms the maze has, in a three-arm maze it is 22%, in a four-arm or plus maze it is around 9%.\n\n=== '''Criticisms''' ===\n'''Animal Models:''' As a method predominantly used in studies involving non-human animals, there are inherent criticisms which arise from the extent to which findings can extend towards humans in comparative psychology <ref>Bracken, M.

While the spontaneous alternation test was designed to gain insight into human cognition and behaviour, its direct replication using human subjects is rarely conducted. Life-sized mazes are impractical to create and lack naturalism in their implementation, eliciting a number of confounding variables related to social desirability and demand characteristics.

Iterations, or sprints, are short time frames ([[timeboxing|timeboxes]]) that typically last from one to four weeks. Each iteration involves a [[cross-functional team]] working in all functions: [[Project planning|planning]], [[requirements analysis|analysis]], [[Software design|design]], [[Computer programming|coding]], [[unit testing]], and [[acceptance testing]]. At the end of the iteration a working product is demonstrated to stakeholders. This minimizes overall risk and allows the product to adapt to changes quickly.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite book | author=Moran, A.|title=Agile Risk Management |publisher=Springer Verlag|year=2014|isbn=978-3319050072}}</ref> An iteration might not add enough functionality to warrant a market release, but the goal is to have an available release (with minimal [[Software bug|bugs]]) at the end of each iteration.<ref name=\"embracing change\">{{cite journal|\nlast=Beck|first=Kent|\nyear=1999|title=Embracing Change with Extreme Programming|\njournal=Computer|volume=32|issue=10|\npages=70\u201377|\ndoi=10.1109/2.796139}}</ref> Multiple iterations might be required to release a product or new features.

This person is agreed by stakeholders to act on their behalf and makes a personal commitment to being available for developers to answer questions throughout the iteration. At the end of each iteration, stakeholders and the customer representative review progress and re-evaluate priorities with a view to optimizing the [[Rate of return|return on investment]] (ROI) and ensuring alignment with customer needs and company goals.\n\nIn agile software development, an '''information radiator''' is a (normally large) physical display located prominently near the development team, where passers-by can see it.

Big up-front specifications would probably cause a lot of waste in such cases, i.e., are not economically sound.

One key of adaptive development methods is a [[Rolling Wave planning|''rolling wave'']] approach to schedule planning, which identifies milestones but leaves flexibility in the path to reach them, and also allows for the milestones themselves to change.<ref>{{cite book | title=Agile and Iterative Development: A Manager's Guide | last=Larman | first=Craig | year=2004 |page=253 | chapter=Chapter 11: Practice Tips |  isbn=9780131111554 | chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=76rnV5Exs50C&pg=PA253&dq=adaptive%20predictive%20%22rolling%20wave%22#v=onepage&q=adaptive%20predictive%20%22rolling%20wave%22 | accessdate=14 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[File: SimulTrain BurnUp Chart.jpg|thumb|Agile Software Development: BurnUp Chart shows the dynamics of created for clients value (story points) in project management simulation [[SimulTrain]].]]\n\n\n\n''Adaptive'' methods focus on adapting quickly to changing realities. When the needs of a project change, an adaptive team changes as well. An adaptive team has difficulty describing exactly what will happen in the future. The further away a date is, the more vague an adaptive method is about what will happen on that date. An adaptive team cannot report exactly what tasks they will do next week, but only which features they plan for next month. When asked about a release six months from now, an adaptive team might be able to report only the mission statement for the release, or a statement of expected value vs. cost.\n\n''Predictive'' methods, in contrast, focus on analysing and planning the future in detail and cater for known risks. In the extremes, a predictive team can report exactly what features and tasks are planned for the entire length of the development process. Predictive methods rely on effective early phase analysis and if this goes very wrong, the project may have difficulty changing direction. Predictive teams often institute a [[change control board]] to ensure they consider only the most valuable changes.\n\n[[Risk analysis (engineering)|Risk analysis]] can be used to choose between adaptive (''agile'' or ''value-driven'') and predictive (''plan-driven'') methods.<ref name=\"PMBridgeToAgility\">{{Cite book |last1=Sliger |first1=Michele |last2=Broderick |first2=Stacia |title=The Software Project Manager's Bridge to Agility |publisher=Addison-Wesley |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-321-50275-9 |page=46 }}</ref> [[Barry Boehm]] and [[Richard Turner (computer scientist)|Richard Turner]] suggest that each side of the continuum has its own ''home ground'', as follows:<ref name=\"boehm2004\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Home grounds of different development methods\n|-\n! style=\"width: 33%\" | Value-driven methods\n! style=\"width: 33%\" | Plan-driven methods\n!

In the [[waterfall model]], there is always a separate '''''testing phase''''' after a '''''build phase'''''; however, in agile software development testing is completed in the same iteration as programming. \n\nAnother difference is that traditional \"waterfall\" software development moves a project through various Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) phases. One phase is completed in its entirety before moving on to the next phase.\n\nBecause testing is done in every iteration\u2014which develops a small piece of the software\u2014users can frequently use those new pieces of software and validate the value. After the users know the real value of the updated piece of software, they can make better decisions about the software's future. Having a value retrospective and software re-planning session in each iteration\u2014[[Scrum (software development)|Scrum]] typically has iterations of just two weeks\u2014helps the team continuously adapt its plans so as to maximize the value it delivers. This follows a pattern similar to the [[PDCA]] cycle, as the work is ''planned'', ''done'', ''checked'' (in the review and retrospective), and any changes agreed are ''acted'' upon.\n\nThis iterative approach supports a ''product'' rather than a ''project'' mindset. This provides greater flexibility throughout the development process; whereas on projects the requirements are defined and locked down from the very beginning, making it difficult to change them later. Iterative product development allows the software to evolve in response to changes in business environment or market requirements.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/business/at-the-kickoff-project-development-vs-product-development/|title=At the Kickoff: Project Development vs Product Development|date=12 February 2016|website=AltexSoft Inc.|access-date=31 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nBecause of the short iteration style of agile software development, it also has strong connections with the [[lean startup]] concept.\n\n=== Code vs. documentation ===\nIn a letter to ''[[Computer (magazine)|IEEE Computer]]'', Steven Rakitin expressed cynicism about agile software development, calling it \"yet another attempt to undermine the discipline of software engineering\" and translating \"working software over comprehensive documentation\" as \"we want to spend all our time coding. Remember, real programmers don't write documentation.\"<ref name=\"rakitin2001\">{{Cite journal| last=Rakitin| first=Steven R.| title= Manifesto Elicits Cynicism: Reader's letter to the editor by Steven R.

[[Alistair Cockburn]] wrote of the ''Crystal Clear'' method: \n{{Quote|text=Crystal considers development a series of co-operative games, and intends that the documentation is enough to help the next win at the next game. The work products for Crystal include use cases, risk list, iteration plan, core domain models, and design notes to inform on choices...however there are no templates for these documents and descriptions are necessarily vague, but the objective is clear, '''just enough documentation''' for the next game.

Washington: OOPSLA 2002</ref>\n\nWhen agile software development is applied in a distributed setting (with teams dispersed across multiple business locations), it is commonly referred to as distributed agile development. The goal is to leverage the unique benefits offered by each approach. Distributed development allows organizations to build software by strategically setting up teams in different parts of the globe, virtually building software round-the-clock (more commonly referred to as follow-the-sun model). On the other hand, agile development provides increased transparency, continuous feedback and more flexibility when responding to changes.\n\n=== Regulated domains ===\n\nAgile software development methods were initially seen as best suitable for non-critical product developments, thereby excluded from use in regulated domains such as medical devices, pharmaceutical, financial, nuclear systems, automotive, and avionics sectors, etc. However, in the last several years, there have been several initiatives for the adaptation of agile methods for these domains.<ref name=\"Cawley2010\">{{Cite book|title = Lean/Agile Software Development Methodologies in Regulated Environments \u2013 State of the Art|journal = Lean Enterprise Software and Systems|date = 2010|isbn = 978-3-642-16415-6|pages = 31\u201336|series = Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing|volume = 65|first = Ois\u00edn|last = Cawley|first2 = Xiaofeng|last2 = Wang|first3 = Ita|last3 = Richardson|editor-first = Pekka|editor-last = Abrahamsson|editor2-first = Nilay|editor2-last = Oza|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-16416-3_4|hdl = 10344/683}}</ref><ref name=\"McHugh2014\">{{Cite book|title = An Agile Implementation within a Medical Device Software Organisation|journal = Software Process Improvement and Capability Determination|date = 2014-11-04|isbn = 978-3-319-13035-4|pages = 190\u2013201|series = Communications in Computer and Information Science|volume = 477|first = Martin|last = McHugh|first2 = Fergal|last2 = McCaffery|first3 = Garret|last3 = Coady|editor-first = Antanas|editor-last = Mitasiunas|editor2-first = Terry|editor2-last = Rout|editor3-first = Rory V.|editor3-last = O'Connor|editor4-first = Alec|editor4-last = Dorling| display-editors = 3|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-13036-1_17|url = https://arrow.dit.ie/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1152&context=scschcomcon}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Wang|first=Yang|last2=Ramadani|first2=Jasmin|last3=Wagner|first3=Stefan|date=2017-11-29|title=An Exploratory Study on Applying a Scrum Development Process for Safety-Critical Systems|journal=Product-Focused Software Process Improvement|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|language=en|volume=10611|pages=324\u2013340|arxiv=1703.05375|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-69926-4_23|isbn=9783319699257|bibcode=2017arXiv170305375W}}</ref><ref name=\"SafeScrum\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sintef.no/safescrum |title=SafeScrum - SINTEF |publisher=Sintef.no |date= |accessdate=2019-03-26}}</ref><ref>Thor Myklebust, Tor St\u00e5lhane, Geir Kjetil Hanssen, Tormod Wien and B\u00f8rge Haugset: Scrum, documentation and the IEC 61508-3:2010 software standard, http://www.sintef.no/globalassets/ec-61508-documentation-and-safescrum-psam12.pdf</ref>\n\nThere are numerous standards that may apply in regulated domains, including [[ISO 26262]], [[ISO 9000]], [[ISO 9001]], and [[ISO/IEC 15504]].\nA number of key concerns are of particular importance in regulated domains:<ref name=\"Fitzgerald2013\">{{Cite book|title = Scaling agile methods to regulated environments: An industry case study|journal = 2013 35th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE)|date = May 2013|pages = 863\u2013872|doi = 10.1109/ICSE.2013.6606635|first = B.|last = Fitzgerald|first2 = K.-J.|last2 = Stol|first3 = R.|last3 = O'Sullivan|first4 = D.|last4 = O'Brien|isbn = 978-1-4673-3076-3|hdl = 10344/3055}}</ref>\n\n* [[Quality assurance]] (QA): Systematic and inherent quality management underpinning a controlled professional process and reliability and correctness of product.\n* Safety and security: Formal planning and risk management to mitigate safety risks for users and securely protecting users from unintentional and malicious misuse.\n*[[Traceability]]: Documentation providing auditable evidence of regulatory compliance and facilitating traceability and investigation of problems.\n* [[Verification and Validation]] (V&V): Embedded throughout the software development process (e.g. user requirements specification, functional specification, design specification, code review, unit tests, integration tests, system tests).\n\n==Experience and adoption==\nAlthough agile software development methods can be used with any programming paradigm or language in practice, they were originally closely associated with object-oriented environments such as Smalltalk and Lisp and later Java. The initial adopters of agile methods were usually small to medium-sized teams working on unprecedented systems with requirements that were difficult to finalize and likely to change as the system was being developed.

Below are some common examples:\n\n====Lack of overall product design====\nA goal of agile software development is to focus more on producing working software and less on documentation. This is in contrast to waterfall models where the process is often highly controlled and minor changes to the system require significant revision of supporting documentation. However, this does not justify completely doing without any analysis or design at all. Failure to pay attention to design can cause a team to proceed rapidly at first but then to have significant rework required as they attempt to scale up the system. One of the key features of agile software development is that it is iterative. When done correctly design emerges as the system is developed and commonalities and opportunities for re-use are discovered.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Beck|first1=Kent|title=Extreme Programming Explained|date=2000|publisher=Addison-Wesley|isbn=978-0201616415|pages=[https://archive.org/details/extremeprogrammi00beck/page/48 48\u201349]|url=https://archive.org/details/extremeprogrammi00beck/page/48}}</ref>\n\n====Adding stories to an iteration in progress====\n\nIn agile software development, ''stories'' (similar to [[use case]] descriptions) are typically used to define requirements and an ''iteration'' is a short period of time during which the team commits to specific goals.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rouse|first1=Margaret|title=Sprint (software development) definition|url=http://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/definition/Scrum-sprint|website=searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com|accessdate=2 October 2015}}</ref> Adding stories to an iteration in progress is detrimental to a good flow of work. These should be added to the product backlog and prioritized for a subsequent iteration or in rare cases the iteration could be cancelled.<ref name=\"axisagile.com.au\">{{cite web|last1=Goldstein|first1=Ilan|title=Sprint issues \u2013 when sprints turn into crawls|url=http://www.axisagile.com.au/blog/planning-and-metrics/sprint-issues-when-sprints-turn-into-crawls/|website=www.axisagile.com.au|accessdate=2014-06-08|date=11 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nThis does not mean that a story cannot expand. Teams must deal with new information, which may produce additional tasks for a story. If the new information prevents the story from being completed during the iteration, then it should be carried over to a subsequent iteration. However, it should be prioritized against all remaining stories, as the new information may have changed the story's original priority.\n\n====Lack of sponsor support====\n\nAgile software development is often implemented as a grassroots effort in organizations by software development teams trying to optimize their development processes and ensure consistency in the software development life cycle. By not having sponsor support, teams may face difficulties and resistance from business partners, other development teams and management. Additionally, they may suffer without appropriate funding and resources.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://agile-only.com/master-thesis/project-mgmt/pr-and-rd|title=Project Roles and Responsibility Distribution|website=agile-only.com|accessdate=2014-06-15}}</ref> This increases the likelihood of failure.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bourne|first1=Lynda|title=What Does a Project Sponsor Really Do?|url=http://blogs.pmi.org/blog/voices_on_project_management/2012/04/what-does-a-project-sponsor-re.html|website=blogs.pmi.org|accessdate=2014-06-08}}</ref>\n\n====Insufficient training====\n\nA survey performed by VersionOne found respondents cited insufficient training as the most significant cause for failed agile implementations<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.versionone.com/state_of_agile_development_survey/09/page5.asp|title=9th State of Agile Report|website=Stage of Agile Survey|publisher=VersionOne|accessdate=2014-06-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150112225122/http://www.versionone.com/state_of_agile_development_survey/09/page5.asp|archive-date=12 January 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Teams have fallen into the trap of assuming the reduced processes of agile software development compared to other methodologies such as waterfall means that there are no actual rules for agile software development. {{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n====Product owner role is not properly filled====\n\nThe [[product owner]] is responsible for representing the business in the development activity and is often the most demanding role.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Sims, Chris |author2=Johnson, Hillary Louise |title=The Elements of Scrum|date=2011-02-15|publisher=Dymaxicon|page=73|edition=Kindle}}</ref>\n\nA common mistake is to have the product owner role filled by someone from the development team. This requires the team to make its own decisions on prioritization without real feedback from the business. They try to solve business issues internally or delay work as they reach outside the team for direction. This often leads to distraction and a breakdown in collaboration.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rothman|first1=Johanna Rothman|title=When You Have No Product Owner At All|url=http://www.jrothman.com/blog/mpd/2011/08/when-you-have-no-product-owner-at-all.html|website=www.jrothman.com|accessdate=2014-06-08|date=25 August 2011}}</ref>\n\n====Teams are not focused====\n\nAgile software development requires teams to meet product commitments, which means they should focus only on work for that product. However, team members who appear to have spare capacity are often expected to take on other work, which makes it difficult for them to help complete the work to which their team had committed.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fox|first1=Alyssa|title=Working on Multiple Agile Teams|url=http://techwhirl.com/working-multiple-agile-teams/|website=techwhirl.com/|accessdate=2014-06-14|date=8 April 2014}}</ref>\n\n====Excessive preparation/planning====\n\nTeams may fall into the trap of spending too much time preparing or planning. This is a common trap for teams less familiar with agile software development where the teams feel obliged to have a complete understanding and specification of all stories. Teams should be prepared to move forward only with those stories in which they have confidence, then during the iteration continue to discover and prepare work for subsequent iterations (often referred to as [[refinement (computing)|backlog refinement]] or grooming).\n\n====Problem-solving in the daily standup====\n\nA daily standup should be a focused, timely meeting where all team members disseminate information. If problem-solving occurs, it often can only involve certain team members and potentially is not the best use of the entire team's time. If during the daily standup the team starts diving into problem-solving, it should be set aside until a sub-team can discuss, usually immediately after the standup completes. <ref>{{cite web|title=Daily Scrum Meeting|url=http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/daily-scrum|website=www.mountaingoatsoftware.com|accessdate=2014-06-14}}</ref>\n\n====Assigning tasks====\n\nOne of the intended benefits of agile software development is to empower the team to make choices, as they are closest to the problem. Additionally, they should make choices as close to implementation as possible, to use more timely information in the decision. If team members are assigned tasks by others or too early in the process, the benefits of localized and timely decision making can be lost.<ref name=\"Effective Sprint Planning\">{{cite web|last1=May |first1=Robert |title=Effective Sprint Planning |url=http://www.agileexecutives.org/Blogs/tabid/66/EntryId/18/Effective-Sprint-Planning.aspx |website=www.agileexecutives.org |accessdate=2014-06-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140628102810/http://www.agileexecutives.org/Blogs/tabid/66/EntryId/18/Effective-Sprint-Planning.aspx |archivedate=28 June 2014 }}</ref>\n\nBeing assigned work also constrains team members into certain roles (for example, team member A must always do the database work), which limits opportunities for cross-training.<ref name=\"Effective Sprint Planning\"/> Team members themselves can choose to take on tasks that stretch their abilities and provide cross-training opportunities.\n\n====Scrum master as a contributor====\n\nAnother common pitfall is for a scrum master to act as a contributor. While not prohibited by the Scrum methodology, the scrum master needs to ensure they have the capacity to act in the role of scrum master first and not working on development tasks. A scrum master's role is to facilitate the process rather than create the product.<ref name=\"agileconnection.com\">{{cite web|last1=Berczuk|first1=Steve|title=Mission Possible: ScrumMaster and Technical Contributor|url=http://www.agileconnection.com/article/mission-possible-scrummaster-and-technical-contributor?page=0%2C1|website=www.agileconnection.com|accessdate=2014-06-14}}</ref>\n\nHaving the scrum master also multitasking may result in too many context switches to be productive. Additionally, as a scrum master is responsible for ensuring roadblocks are removed so that the team can make forward progress, the benefit gained by individual tasks moving forward may not outweigh roadblocks that are deferred due to lack of capacity.<ref name=\"agileconnection.com\"/>\n\n====Lack of test automation====\n\nDue to the iterative nature of agile development, multiple rounds of testing are often needed. Automated testing helps reduce the impact of repeated unit, integration, and regression tests and frees developers and testers to focus on higher value work.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Namta|first1=Rajneesh|title=Thoughts on Test Automation in Agile|url=http://www.infoq.com/articles/thoughts-on-test-automation-in-agile|website=www.infoq.com|accessdate=2014-06-14}}</ref>\n\nTest automation also supports continued [[refactoring]] required by iterative software development.

The customer or product owner often push for a fixed scope for an iteration. However, teams should be reluctant to commit to the locked time, resources and scope (commonly known as the [[project management triangle]]).

It is a variant of [[iterative and incremental development|iterative life cycle]]<ref>ExecutiveBrief, [http://www.pmhut.com/which-life-cycle-is-best-for-your-project Which Life Cycle Is Best For Your Project?], PM Hut. Accessed 23 October 2009.</ref> where [[deliverable]]s are submitted in stages. The main difference between agile and iterative development is that agile methods complete small portions of the deliverables in each delivery cycle (iteration),<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.versionone.com/agile-project-management/ | title=Agile Project Management | publisher=VersionOne | accessdate=1 June 2015}}</ref> while iterative methods evolve the entire set of deliverables over time, completing them near the end of the project. Both iterative and agile methods were developed as a reaction to various obstacles that developed in more sequential forms of project organization. For example, as technology projects grow in complexity, end users tend to have difficulty defining the long-term requirements without being able to view progressive prototypes. Projects that develop in iterations can constantly gather feedback to help refine those requirements.\n\nAgile management also offers a simple framework promoting communication and reflection on past [[Work (project management)|work]] amongst [[Project team|team]] members.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.project-laneways.com.au/certification-courses/agilepm/what-is-agile-management | title=What is Agile Management? | publisher=Project Laneways | accessdate=1 June 2015}}</ref> Teams who were using traditional waterfall planning and adopted the agile way of development typically go through a transformation phase and often take help from agile coaches who help guide the teams through a smooth transformation. There are typically two styles of agile coaching: push-based and [[pull-based agile coaching]]. Agile management approaches have also been employed and adapted to the business and government sectors. For example, within the [[federal government of the United States]], the [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID) is employing a [[collaborative project management]] approach that focuses on incorporating [[collaborating, learning and adapting]] (CLA) strategies to iterate and adapt programming.<ref>USAID.

Big up-front specifications would probably cause a lot of waste in such cases, i.e., are not economically sound.

One key of adaptive development methods is a [[Rolling Wave planning|''rolling wave'']] approach to schedule planning, which identifies milestones but leaves flexibility in the path to reach them, and also allows for the milestones themselves to change.<ref>{{cite book | title=Agile and Iterative Development: A Manager's Guide | last=Larman | first=Craig | year=2004 |page=253 | chapter=Chapter 11: Practice Tips |  isbn=9780131111554 | chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=76rnV5Exs50C&pg=PA253&dq=adaptive%20predictive%20%22rolling%20wave%22#v=onepage&q=adaptive%20predictive%20%22rolling%20wave%22 | accessdate=14 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[File: SimulTrain BurnUp Chart.jpg|thumb|Agile Software Development: BurnUp Chart shows the dynamics of created for clients value (story points) in project management simulation [[SimulTrain]].]]\n\n\n''Adaptive'' methods focus on adapting quickly to changing realities. When the needs of a project change, an adaptive team changes as well. An adaptive team has difficulty describing exactly what will happen in the future. The further away a date is, the more vague an adaptive method is about what will happen on that date. An adaptive team cannot report exactly what tasks they will do next week, but only which features they plan for next month. When asked about a release six months from now, an adaptive team might be able to report only the mission statement for the release, or a statement of expected value vs. cost.\n\n''Predictive'' methods, in contrast, focus on analysing and planning the future in detail and cater for known risks. In the extremes, a predictive team can report exactly what features and tasks are planned for the entire length of the development process. Predictive methods rely on effective early phase analysis and if this goes very wrong, the project may have difficulty changing direction. Predictive teams often institute a [[change control board]] to ensure they consider only the most valuable changes.\n\n[[Risk analysis (engineering)|Risk analysis]] can be used to choose between adaptive (''agile'' or ''value-driven'') and predictive (''plan-driven'') methods.<ref name=\"PMBridgeToAgility\">{{Cite book |last1=Sliger |first1=Michele |last2=Broderick |first2=Stacia |title=The Software Project Manager's Bridge to Agility |publisher=Addison-Wesley |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-321-50275-9 |page=46 }}</ref> [[Barry Boehm]] and [[Richard Turner (computer scientist)|Richard Turner]] suggest that each side of the continuum has its own ''home ground'', as follows:<ref name=\"boehm2004\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Home grounds of different development methods\n|-\n! style=\"width: 33%\" | Value-driven methods\n! style=\"width: 33%\" | Plan-driven methods\n!

In the [[waterfall model]], there is always a separate '''''testing phase''''' after a '''''build phase'''''; however, in agile software development testing is completed in the same iteration as programming. \n\nAnother difference is that traditional \"waterfall\" software development moves a project through various Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) phases. One phase is completed in its entirety before moving on to the next phase.\n\nBecause testing is done in every iteration\u2014which develops a small piece of the software\u2014users can frequently use those new pieces of software and validate the value. After the users know the real value of the updated piece of software, they can make better decisions about the software's future. Having a value retrospective and software re-planning session in each iteration\u2014[[Scrum (software development)|Scrum]] typically has iterations of just two weeks\u2014helps the team continuously adapt its plans so as to maximize the value it delivers. This follows a pattern similar to the [[PDCA]] cycle, as the work is ''planned'', ''done'', ''checked'' (in the review and retrospective), and any changes agreed are ''acted'' upon.\n\nThis iterative approach supports a ''product'' rather than a ''project'' mindset. This provides greater flexibility throughout the development process; whereas on projects the requirements are defined and locked down from the very beginning, making it difficult to change them later. Iterative product development allows the software to evolve in response to changes in business environment or market requirements.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/business/at-the-kickoff-project-development-vs-product-development/|title=At the Kickoff: Project Development vs Product Development|date=12 February 2016|website=AltexSoft Inc.|access-date=31 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nBecause of the short iteration style of agile software development, it also has strong connections with the [[lean startup]] concept.\n\n=== Code vs. documentation ===\nIn a letter to ''[[Computer (magazine)|IEEE Computer]]'', Steven Rakitin expressed cynicism about agile software development, calling it \"yet another attempt to undermine the discipline of software engineering\" and translating \"working software over comprehensive documentation\" as \"we want to spend all our time coding.

Washington: OOPSLA 2002</ref>\n\nWhen agile software development is applied in a distributed setting (with teams dispersed across multiple business locations), it is commonly referred to as distributed agile development. The goal is to leverage the unique benefits offered by each approach. Distributed development allows organizations to build software by strategically setting up teams in different parts of the globe, virtually building software round-the-clock (more commonly referred to as follow-the-sun model). On the other hand, agile development provides increased transparency, continuous feedback and more flexibility when responding to changes.\n\n=== Regulated domains ===\n\nAgile software development methods were initially seen as best suitable for non-critical product developments, thereby excluded from use in regulated domains such as medical devices, pharmaceutical, financial, nuclear systems, automotive, and avionics sectors, etc. However, in the last several years, there have been several initiatives for the adaptation of agile methods for these domains.<ref name=\"Cawley2010\">{{Cite book|title = Lean/Agile Software Development Methodologies in Regulated Environments \u2013 State of the Art|journal = Lean Enterprise Software and Systems|date = 2010|isbn = 978-3-642-16415-6|pages = 31\u201336|series = Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing|volume = 65|first = Ois\u00edn|last = Cawley|first2 = Xiaofeng|last2 = Wang|first3 = Ita|last3 = Richardson|editor-first = Pekka|editor-last = Abrahamsson|editor2-first = Nilay|editor2-last = Oza|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-16416-3_4|hdl = 10344/683}}</ref><ref name=\"McHugh2014\">{{Cite book|title = An Agile Implementation within a Medical Device Software Organisation|journal = Software Process Improvement and Capability Determination|date = 2014-11-04|isbn = 978-3-319-13035-4|pages = 190\u2013201|series = Communications in Computer and Information Science|volume = 477|first = Martin|last = McHugh|first2 = Fergal|last2 = McCaffery|first3 = Garret|last3 = Coady|editor-first = Antanas|editor-last = Mitasiunas|editor2-first = Terry|editor2-last = Rout|editor3-first = Rory V.|editor3-last = O'Connor|editor4-first = Alec|editor4-last = Dorling| display-editors = 3|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-13036-1_17|url = https://arrow.dit.ie/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1152&context=scschcomcon}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Wang|first=Yang|last2=Ramadani|first2=Jasmin|last3=Wagner|first3=Stefan|date=2017-11-29|title=An Exploratory Study on Applying a Scrum Development Process for Safety-Critical Systems|journal=Product-Focused Software Process Improvement|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|language=en|volume=10611|pages=324\u2013340|arxiv=1703.05375|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-69926-4_23|isbn=9783319699257|bibcode=2017arXiv170305375W}}</ref><ref name=\"SafeScrum\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sintef.no/safescrum |title=SafeScrum - SINTEF |publisher=Sintef.no |date= |accessdate=2019-03-26}}</ref><ref>Thor Myklebust, Tor St\u00e5lhane, Geir Kjetil Hanssen, Tormod Wien and B\u00f8rge Haugset: Scrum, documentation and the IEC 61508-3:2010 software standard, http://www.sintef.no/globalassets/ec-61508-documentation-and-safescrum-psam12.pdf</ref>\n\nThere are numerous standards that may apply in regulated domains, including [[ISO 26262]], [[ISO 9000]], [[ISO 9001]], and [[ISO/IEC 15504]].\nA number of key concerns are of particular importance in regulated domains:<ref name=\"Fitzgerald2013\">{{Cite book|title = Scaling agile methods to regulated environments: An industry case study|journal = 2013 35th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE)|date = May 2013|pages = 863\u2013872|doi = 10.1109/ICSE.2013.6606635|first = B.|last = Fitzgerald|first2 = K.-J.|last2 = Stol|first3 = R.|last3 = O'Sullivan|first4 = D.|last4 = O'Brien|isbn = 978-1-4673-3076-3|hdl = 10344/3055}}</ref>\n\n* [[Quality assurance]] (QA): Systematic and inherent quality management underpinning a controlled professional process and reliability and correctness of product.\n* Safety and security: Formal planning and risk management to mitigate safety risks for users and securely protecting users from unintentional and malicious misuse.\n*[[Traceability]]: Documentation providing auditable evidence of regulatory compliance and facilitating traceability and investigation of problems.\n* [[Verification and Validation]] (V&V): Embedded throughout the software development process (e.g. user requirements specification, functional specification, design specification, code review, unit tests, integration tests, system tests).\n\n==Experience and adoption==\nAlthough agile software development methods can be used with any programming paradigm or language in practice, they were originally closely associated with object-oriented environments such as Smalltalk and Lisp and later Java. The initial adopters of agile methods were usually small to medium-sized teams working on unprecedented systems with requirements that were difficult to finalize and likely to change as the system was being developed.

Below are some common examples:\n\n====Lack of overall product design====\nA goal of agile software development is to focus more on producing working software and less on documentation. This is in contrast to waterfall models where the process is often highly controlled and minor changes to the system require significant revision of supporting documentation. However, this does not justify completely doing without any analysis or design at all. Failure to pay attention to design can cause a team to proceed rapidly at first but then to have significant rework required as they attempt to scale up the system. One of the key features of agile software development is that it is iterative. When done correctly design emerges as the system is developed and commonalities and opportunities for re-use are discovered.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Beck|first1=Kent|title=Extreme Programming Explained|date=2000|publisher=Addison-Wesley|isbn=978-0201616415|pages=[https://archive.org/details/extremeprogrammi00beck/page/48 48\u201349]|url=https://archive.org/details/extremeprogrammi00beck/page/48}}</ref>\n\n====Adding stories to an iteration in progress====\n\nIn agile software development, ''stories'' (similar to [[use case]] descriptions) are typically used to define requirements and an ''iteration'' is a short period of time during which the team commits to specific goals.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rouse|first1=Margaret|title=Sprint (software development) definition|url=http://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/definition/Scrum-sprint|website=searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com|accessdate=2 October 2015}}</ref> Adding stories to an iteration in progress is detrimental to a good flow of work. These should be added to the product backlog and prioritized for a subsequent iteration or in rare cases the iteration could be cancelled.<ref name=\"axisagile.com.au\">{{cite web|last1=Goldstein|first1=Ilan|title=Sprint issues \u2013 when sprints turn into crawls|url=http://www.axisagile.com.au/blog/planning-and-metrics/sprint-issues-when-sprints-turn-into-crawls/|website=www.axisagile.com.au|accessdate=2014-06-08|date=11 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nThis does not mean that a story cannot expand. Teams must deal with new information, which may produce additional tasks for a story. If the new information prevents the story from being completed during the iteration, then it should be carried over to a subsequent iteration. However, it should be prioritized against all remaining stories, as the new information may have changed the story's original priority.\n\n====Lack of sponsor support====\n\nAgile software development is often implemented as a grassroots effort in organizations by software development teams trying to optimize their development processes and ensure consistency in the software development life cycle. By not having sponsor support, teams may face difficulties and resistance from business partners, other development teams and management. Additionally, they may suffer without appropriate funding and resources.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://agile-only.com/master-thesis/project-mgmt/pr-and-rd|title=Project Roles and Responsibility Distribution|website=agile-only.com|accessdate=2014-06-15}}</ref> This increases the likelihood of failure.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bourne|first1=Lynda|title=What Does a Project Sponsor Really Do?|url=http://blogs.pmi.org/blog/voices_on_project_management/2012/04/what-does-a-project-sponsor-re.html|website=blogs.pmi.org|accessdate=2014-06-08}}</ref>\n\n====Insufficient training====\n\nA survey performed by VersionOne found respondents cited insufficient training as the most significant cause for failed agile implementations<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.versionone.com/state_of_agile_development_survey/09/page5.asp|title=9th State of Agile Report|website=Stage of Agile Survey|publisher=VersionOne|accessdate=2014-06-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150112225122/http://www.versionone.com/state_of_agile_development_survey/09/page5.asp|archive-date=12 January 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Teams have fallen into the trap of assuming the reduced processes of agile software development compared to other methodologies such as waterfall means that there are no actual rules for agile software development. {{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n====Product owner role is not properly filled====\n\nThe [[product owner]] is responsible for representing the business in the development activity and is often the most demanding role.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Sims, Chris |author2=Johnson, Hillary Louise |title=The Elements of Scrum|date=2011-02-15|publisher=Dymaxicon|page=73|edition=Kindle}}</ref>\n\nA common mistake is to have the product owner role filled by someone from the development team. This requires the team to make its own decisions on prioritization without real feedback from the business. They try to solve business issues internally or delay work as they reach outside the team for direction. This often leads to distraction and a breakdown in collaboration.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rothman|first1=Johanna Rothman|title=When You Have No Product Owner At All|url=http://www.jrothman.com/blog/mpd/2011/08/when-you-have-no-product-owner-at-all.html|website=www.jrothman.com|accessdate=2014-06-08|date=25 August 2011}}</ref>\n\n====Teams are not focused====\n\nAgile software development requires teams to meet product commitments, which means they should focus only on work for that product. However, team members who appear to have spare capacity are often expected to take on other work, which makes it difficult for them to help complete the work to which their team had committed.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fox|first1=Alyssa|title=Working on Multiple Agile Teams|url=http://techwhirl.com/working-multiple-agile-teams/|website=techwhirl.com/|accessdate=2014-06-14|date=8 April 2014}}</ref>\n\n====Excessive preparation/planning====\n\nTeams may fall into the trap of spending too much time preparing or planning. This is a common trap for teams less familiar with agile software development where the teams feel obliged to have a complete understanding and specification of all stories. Teams should be prepared to move forward only with those stories in which they have confidence, then during the iteration continue to discover and prepare work for subsequent iterations (often referred to as [[refinement (computing)|backlog refinement]] or grooming).\n\n====Problem-solving in the daily standup====\n\nA daily standup should be a focused, timely meeting where all team members disseminate information. If problem-solving occurs, it often can only involve certain team members and potentially is not the best use of the entire team's time. If during the daily standup the team starts diving into problem-solving, it should be set aside until a sub-team can discuss, usually immediately after the standup completes. <ref>{{cite web|title=Daily Scrum Meeting|url=http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/daily-scrum|website=www.mountaingoatsoftware.com|accessdate=2014-06-14}}</ref>\n\n====Assigning tasks====\n\nOne of the intended benefits of agile software development is to empower the team to make choices, as they are closest to the problem. Additionally, they should make choices as close to implementation as possible, to use more timely information in the decision. If team members are assigned tasks by others or too early in the process, the benefits of localized and timely decision making can be lost.<ref name=\"Effective Sprint Planning\">{{cite web|last1=May |first1=Robert |title=Effective Sprint Planning |url=http://www.agileexecutives.org/Blogs/tabid/66/EntryId/18/Effective-Sprint-Planning.aspx |website=www.agileexecutives.org |accessdate=2014-06-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140628102810/http://www.agileexecutives.org/Blogs/tabid/66/EntryId/18/Effective-Sprint-Planning.aspx |archivedate=28 June 2014 }}</ref>\n\nBeing assigned work also constrains team members into certain roles (for example, team member A must always do the database work), which limits opportunities for cross-training.<ref name=\"Effective Sprint Planning\"/> Team members themselves can choose to take on tasks that stretch their abilities and provide cross-training opportunities.\n\n====Scrum master as a contributor====\n\nAnother common pitfall is for a scrum master to act as a contributor. While not prohibited by the Scrum methodology, the scrum master needs to ensure they have the capacity to act in the role of scrum master first and not working on development tasks. A scrum master's role is to facilitate the process rather than create the product.<ref name=\"agileconnection.com\">{{cite web|last1=Berczuk|first1=Steve|title=Mission Possible: ScrumMaster and Technical Contributor|url=http://www.agileconnection.com/article/mission-possible-scrummaster-and-technical-contributor?page=0%2C1|website=www.agileconnection.com|accessdate=2014-06-14}}</ref>\n\nHaving the scrum master also multitasking may result in too many context switches to be productive. Additionally, as a scrum master is responsible for ensuring roadblocks are removed so that the team can make forward progress, the benefit gained by individual tasks moving forward may not outweigh roadblocks that are deferred due to lack of capacity.<ref name=\"agileconnection.com\"/>\n\n====Lack of test automation====\n\nDue to the iterative nature of agile development, multiple rounds of testing are often needed. Automated testing helps reduce the impact of repeated unit, integration, and regression tests and frees developers and testers to focus on higher value work.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Namta|first1=Rajneesh|title=Thoughts on Test Automation in Agile|url=http://www.infoq.com/articles/thoughts-on-test-automation-in-agile|website=www.infoq.com|accessdate=2014-06-14}}</ref>\n\nTest automation also supports continued [[refactoring]] required by iterative software development.

The customer or product owner often push for a fixed scope for an iteration. However, teams should be reluctant to commit to the locked time, resources and scope (commonly known as the [[project management triangle]]).

It is a variant of [[iterative and incremental development|iterative life cycle]]<ref>ExecutiveBrief, [http://www.pmhut.com/which-life-cycle-is-best-for-your-project Which Life Cycle Is Best For Your Project?], PM Hut. Accessed 23 October 2009.</ref> where [[deliverable]]s are submitted in stages. The main difference between agile and iterative development is that agile methods complete small portions of the deliverables in each delivery cycle (iteration),<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.versionone.com/agile-project-management/ | title=Agile Project Management | publisher=VersionOne | accessdate=1 June 2015}}</ref> while iterative methods evolve the entire set of deliverables over time, completing them near the end of the project. Both iterative and agile methods were developed as a reaction to various obstacles that developed in more sequential forms of project organization. For example, as technology projects grow in complexity, end users tend to have difficulty defining the long-term requirements without being able to view progressive prototypes. Projects that develop in iterations can constantly gather feedback to help refine those requirements.\n\nAgile management also offers a simple framework promoting communication and reflection on past [[Work (project management)|work]] amongst [[Project team|team]] members.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.project-laneways.com.au/certification-courses/agilepm/what-is-agile-management | title=What is Agile Management? | publisher=Project Laneways | accessdate=1 June 2015}}</ref> Teams who were using traditional waterfall planning and adopted the agile way of development typically go through a transformation phase and often take help from agile coaches who help guide the teams through a smooth transformation. There are typically two styles of agile coaching: push-based and [[pull-based agile coaching]]. Agile management approaches have also been employed and adapted to the business and government sectors. For example, within the [[federal government of the United States]], the [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID) is employing a [[collaborative project management]] approach that focuses on incorporating [[collaborating, learning and adapting]] (CLA) strategies to iterate and adapt programming.<ref>USAID.

The museum is located at his birthplace and childhood home before he went to [[Royal Military College of Canada]] in [[Kingston, Ontario]]. It features displays of artifacts including uniforms, medals, photos, models, etc. from Canadians who fought in the air during [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], as well as a tribute to the \"Red Baron\" [[Manfred von Richthofen]]. The house has the original hardwood floors, Victorian furnishings and other personal possessions of the Bishop family. A gift shop is open during museum hours.\n\nBishop's modest gravesite is also in Owen Sound in Greenwood Cemetery.\nA plaque at the Billy Bishop Museum dedicated to William Avery \"Billy\" Bishop 1894-1956 was erected by the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada. \"Billy Bishop was renowned as a pilot with the Royal Flying Corps and Royal Air Force during World War I by shooting down at least 72 enemy aircraft and leading other daring missions against the enemy.
