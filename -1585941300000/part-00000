It was developed around 1795 and patented by the French-Swiss watchmaker [[Abraham-Louis Breguet]] on June 26, 1801. In a tourbillon the [[escapement]] and [[balance wheel]] are mounted in a rotating cage, in order to negate the effects of gravity when the timepiece (thus the escapement) is stuck in a certain position. By continuously rotating the entire balance wheel/escapement assembly at a slow rate (typically about one revolution per minute), the tourbillon averages out positional errors.\n\nOriginally an attempt to improve accuracy, tourbillons are still included in some expensive modern watches (Swiss models, such as those by [[TAG Heuer]] and [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Constant]], start at around $15,000) as a novelty and a demonstration of watchmaking virtuosity.

Most important is the hairspring, which functions as the [[wiktionary:regulator|timing regulator]] for the escapement and is thus the part most sensitive to exterior effects, such as [[magnetism]], shocks, temperature, as well as inner effects such as pinning positions (inner collet), terminal curve, and heavy points on the balance wheel.\n\nMany inventions have been developed to counteract these problems. Temperature and magnetism problems have been eliminated with [[Elinvar|new materials]]. Shocks have much less effect today than at Breguet's time thanks to [[resilience (materials science)|stronger and more resilient]] materials. The oscillator still gets disturbed at the moment of the shock, but the hairspring is not as easily deformed from shocks as before, and re-stabilizes itself quickly after such an event.{{citation needed|reason=These statements needs a reliable source; it is not self-evident that modern materials are more resilient than those used in Breguet's time, or that the hairspring does not get as easily deformed from shocks as before.|date=April 2015}}\n\nGravity comes into play on the remaining effects. One of them is easily taken away, namely heavy points on the balance wheel. This leaves pinning point and terminal curve. Both of these add a lot of variation to the regulation of a watch: assembly, regulation adjustments by the watchmaker, positioning in the watch, and later position changes by the owner.  As the balance wheel goes from one extreme position to the other in its swing back and forth, the hairspring's coils extend and contract a great deal, leading to problems that are extremely hard to counteract. Some have tried using hairsprings that are cylindrical or even spherical instead of flat as is prominent today. Some variations of Breguet's overcoil have been developed to counteract the effects of the terminal curve.  As for the pinning point, Grossmann, Berthoud, Breguet, Caspari and Leroy<ref>Reymondin, Charles-Andr\u00e9 et al., ''The Theory of Horology'', Switzerland: Swiss Federation of Technical Colleges (FET) [and] the Watchmakers of Switzerland Training and Educational Program Neuch\u00e2tel in collaboration with GREME, 1999 (2nd ed., 2005). {{ISBN|978-2-940025-12-1}}</ref> tried many different possibilities, but not much improvement was gained.\n\nThe biggest obstacle to regulating a watch, even today, is getting a constant impulse from the escapement regardless of its spatial orientation. This has been made much easier with accurate timing instruments which give instantaneous results, whereas in Breguet's time all that watchmakers had was another watch to regulate from.  So, results were not very exact and it could take weeks to get them.  Effects of gravity on an escapement can have quite significant effects with slight variations of position.  Even if a pocket watch was kept most of the time in a breast pocket, the exact position could still vary over 45\u00b0. Watchmakers can regulate a watch in up to eight positions: dial up, crown down, dial down, crown left, crown up, crown right, half-way position crown up, and half-way position crown down.<ref>{{cite web|title=Watch Accuracy|url=https://www.prestigetime.com/page.php?accuracy|website=PrestigeTime.com|publisher=Prestige Time, LLC|accessdate=16 June 2016}}</ref> A tourbillon quite neatly reduces this problem; it only needs to be regulated for three positions: the two horizontal positions, dial up & down, and one vertical position.\n\n[[Image:Greubel Forsey DT30 mechanism.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Greubel Forsey]] Double Tourbillon 30\u00b0 mechanism]]\n\nEven with new materials and improved theories, it is impossible to regulate a mechanical watch so it keeps the same time in all positions.  A tourbillon offers watchmakers the possibility of higher accuracy than conventional movements, although poising the balance well and ensuring that the balance spring expands and contracts symmetrically can achieve nearly the same result. A tourbillon typically makes one complete revolution per minute. This improves timekeeping in the four vertical positions because even if a watch is stationary in a random vertical position, the tourbillon makes the escapement turn around its own axis, effectively cancelling the effect of gravity by turning the balance through all possible vertical positions during its rotation. A normal tourbillon has no effect in horizontal positions, since the horizontal balance is  not affected by gravity as it turns.\n\nA tourbillon has no effect on the change in rate that accompanies a change in attitude from dial horizontal (dial up or down) to dial vertical (pendant up, down, left or right). The change in rate between horizontal and vertical is much greater than rate changes between different vertical positions. Breguet designed the tourbillon for pocket watches that are kept in a vertical position in the waistcoat pocket, and can be maintained in this vertical position overnight by hanging on a suitable stand. In this attitude a tourbillon is effective. However, the attitude of a wristwatch changes frequently from vertical to horizontal depending on the wearer's hand movement. The effect of a tourbillon is small compared to the change in rate resulting from changes from vertical to horizontal, and vice versa. Inclined tourbillons such as those made by [[Greubel Forsey]] are an improvement in this regard.\n\nMechanical watches are now purchased by those who value craftsmanship and aesthetics over very accurate timing.

Both men had been working together since 1992 at Renaud & Papi, where they developed complicated watch movements. The Double Tourbillon 30\u00b0 features one tourbillon carriage rotating once per minute and inclined at 30\u00b0, inside another carriage which rotates once every four minutes. In 2005, Greubel Forsey presented their Quadruple Tourbillon \u00e0 Diff\u00e9rentiel (QDT), using two double-tourbillons working independently. A spherical differential connects the four rotating carriages, distributing torque between two wheels rotating at different speeds.\n\n===Triple-axis tourbillon===\n\n[[Image:Triple Axis Tourbillon Regulator Sport.jpg|thumb|Triple-Axis-Tourbillon Regulator Sport]]\nIn 2004, [[Thomas Prescher]] developed the first triple-axis tourbillon for the Thomas Prescher Haute Horlogerie<ref>{{Citation | publisher = Prescher | place = CH | title = Triple Axis Tourbillon | url = http://www.prescher.ch/Collection/Tourbillion/TripleAxisTourbillon/tabid/77/language/en-US/language/de-DE/Default.aspx}}.</ref> with constant force in the carriage in a wristwatch. It was presented at [[Baselworld]] 2004 in Basel, Switzerland, in a set of three watches including a single-axis, a double-axis and a triple-axis tourbillon.\n\nThe world's unique tri-axial tourbillon movement for wristwatch with traditional jewel bearings only was invented by the independent watchmaker Aaron Becsei, from Bexei Watches, in 2007.  The Primus wristwatch was presented at the [[Baselworld]] 2008 in Basel, Switzerland.<ref>{{Citation | title = About Aaron Becsei | url = http://www.bexei.hu/about.html | publisher = Bexei Watches | place = HU}}.</ref>  In the three axis tourbillon movement, the 3rd (external) cage has a unique form which provides the possibility of using jewel bearings everywhere, instead of ball-bearings.

Examples of companies and watchmakers that include this mechanism are Vianney Halter in his \"Deep Space\" watch, Thomas Prescher, Aaron Becsei, Girard-Perregaux with the \"Tri-Axial Tourbillon\" and Jaeger Le-Coultre with the \"Gyrotourbillon\".\n\n===Flying tourbillon===\nRather than being supported by a bridge, or cock, at both the top and bottom, the '''flying tourbillon''' is cantilevered, being only supported from one side. The first flying tourbillon was designed by Alfred Helwig, instructor at the German School of Watchmaking, in 1920.<ref>{{Citation | contribution-url = http://www.glashuette-original.com/meisterschaft/unvergaenglich/alfred_helwig/uhrmacher_helwig/ | publisher = Glassh\u00fctte original | title = Alfred Helwig | contribution = Uhrmacher Helwig | language = de}}.</ref>\n\nIn 1993, Kiu Tai-Yu, a [[Chinese people|Chinese]] watchmaker residing in [[Hong Kong]], created a semi-flying tourbillon with only an abbreviated carriage for the [[escapement]] wheel and [[pallet fork]], the upper pivot of the [[balance wheel]] being supported in a sapphire bridge.{{Citation needed |date=July 2015}}\n\n===Gyro tourbillon===\nJaeger-LeCoultre's first wristwatch tourbillon was introduced in 1993 (though JLC had produced tourbillons prior to that, including the famous observatory competition caliber 170) and in 2004 the company introduced the Gyrotourbillon I. Gyrotourbillon I is a double-axis tourbillon with a perpetual calendar and equation of time, and since then, Jaeger-LeCoultre has gone on to produce several variations on the multi-axis tourbillon theme. In general, however, these have been fairly thick watches (Gyrotourbillon I is 16mm thick) but with the Reverso Tribute Gyrotourbillon, JLC has produced a thinner and much more wearable version of its multi-axis tourbillon. At 51.1mm x 31mm x 12.4mm it's still not a small watch, but it is very comfortable on the wrist and certainly easier to wear than some of its predecessors.\n\n==Modern tourbillon watches==\nIn modern [[mechanical watch]] designs, a tourbillon is not required to produce a highly accurate timepiece; there is even debate amongst [[horology|horologists]] as to whether tourbillons ever improved the accuracy of mechanical time pieces, even when they were first introduced, or whether the time pieces of the day were inherently inaccurate due to design and manufacturing techniques.  Nevertheless, the tourbillon is one of the most valued features of collectors' watches and premium timepieces,<ref>{{Citation | date = August 2006 | title = WatchTime | format = article | contribution = [[Girard-Perregaux]]'s Tourbillon Icon}}.</ref> possibly for the same reason that mechanical watches fetch a much higher price than similar [[quartz]] [[Quartz watch|watches]] that are much more accurate.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://chronocentric.com/watches/accuracy.shtml |title = Chronocentric: Accuracy of Fine Wristwatches}}</ref>  High-quality tourbillon wristwatches, usually made by the [[Swiss watch|Swiss luxury watch]] industry, are very expensive, and typically retail for tens of thousands of [[dollars]] or [[euro]]s, with much higher prices in the hundreds of thousands of dollars or euros being common.  A recent renaissance of interest in tourbillons has been met by the industry with increased availability of time pieces bearing the feature, with the result that prices for basic tourbillon models have receded somewhat in recent years (whereas previously they were very rare, in either antiques or new merchandise); however, any time piece that has a tourbillon will cost a great deal more than an equivalent piece without the feature. Swiss models typically ''start'' at $40,000, and higher end tourbillon watches can be six figures, whereas some Chinese three-axis make and models range from hundreds to nearly $5000.<ref name=\"Swiss vis-\u00e0-vis Chinese pricing\">{{Cite web |url=https://gearpatrol.com/2016/03/04/why-tourbillon-watches-are-expensive/ |title=Why Do Tourbillons Cost a Small Fortune?

In addition to enhancing the charm of the piece, the tourbillon can act as a second hand for some watches as it generally rotates once per minute. However some tourbillons spin faster ([[Greubel Forsey|Greubel Forsey's]] 24-second tourbillon for example).  There are many watches that feature the oscillating balance wheel visible through the watch dial that are not tourbillons. This feature is often referred to as the \"open heart\" though it is often called a tourbillon by unscrupulous dealers (and tourbillon-style by scrupulous ones).\n\n<gallery widths=\"190px\" heights=\"200px\">\nImage:Jaeger Lecoultre img 0992.jpg|[[Jaeger-LeCoultre]] Tourbillon movement watch\nImage:GP tourbillon.jpg|Tourbillon with three gold bridges, [[Girard-Perregaux]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Improved affordability==\nSeveral Chinese manufacturers now produce a variety of tourbillon movements.<ref>{{cite web |title=Current Chinese Developments | work = Tourbillon | publisher = Traction ink |url=http://www.tractionink.com/watch_wiki/index.php?title=Tourbillon#Current_Chinese_Developments | accessdate =1 June 2010}}</ref> These movements are bought as [[\u00e9bauches]] by some manufacturers and are sometimes incorporated into watches that meet the requirements of the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry to be sold as Swiss Made, which requires 60% of the value to have been made in Switzerland.<ref>{{cite web |title=Swiss Made |publisher=Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry |url=http://www.fhs.ch/en/swissm.php |accessdate=December 21, 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100523071344/http://www.fhs.ch/en/swissm.php |archivedate=May 23, 2010 }}</ref> The availability of less expensive tourbillons has led industry spectators to worry that another [[quartz crisis]] may occur, where the Swiss watch industry will not be able to adapt quickly to less expensive complicated mechanical watches produced in other countries.<ref>{{cite web |title=New 'Quartz' Crisis Ahead? |author=Velociphile |work=Rolex |publisher=Watch pro site |date=August 7, 2005 |url=http://rolex.watchprosite.com/?show=forumpost&msid=317682&ti=287901&fi=128&pi=1878396 |accessdate=1 June 2010}}</ref> In 2016, TAG Heuer began offering the Carrera Heuer-02T tourbillon at a suggested retail price of 14,900 CHF (~US$15,000), significantly lower than the 100,000 CHF or more charged by some other established Swiss watch brands.<ref name=\"Bloom\">{{cite web|last1=Gretler|first1=Corinne|title=TAG Heuer to Undercut Rivals With Cheapest Swiss Tourbillon|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-28/tag-heuer-to-undercut-rivals-with-cheapest-swiss-tourbillon|website=Bloomberg Pursuits|accessdate=21 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n*  {{Cite journal\n| last1 = Denny | first1 = Mark \n| title = The Tourbillon and How It Works\n| doi = 10.1109/MCS.2010.936291 \n| journal = IEEE Control Systems Magazine \n| volume = 30 \n| issue = 3 \n| pages = 19\u201399 \n|date=June 2010\n| publisher = [[IEEE Control Systems Society]]\n}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/jaeger-lecoultre-reverso-tribute-gyrotourbillon-hands-on]\n\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n[[Category:Clocks]]\n[[Category:Horology]]\n[[Category:Swiss inventions]]\n[[Category:French inventions]]\n\n[[ru:\u041c\u0435\u0445\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u044b#\u0422\u0443\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0439\u043e\u043d]]\n", "text_old": "{{Other uses}}\n[[File:Stuhrling Tourbillon Movement.ogv|thumb|280px|Tourbillon movement ([[:File:Stuhrling Tourbillon Movement.ogv|high resolution]])]]\n\nIn [[horology]], a '''tourbillon''' ({{IPAc-en|t|\u028a\u0259r|\u02c8|b|\u026a|l|j|\u0259n}}; {{IPA-fr|tu\u0281bij\u0254\u0303|lang}} \"[[whirlwind]]\") is an addition to the mechanics of a watch [[escapement]] to increase accuracy.

In 1980 Anthony Randall made a double-axis tourbillon in a carriage clock, which was located in the (now closed) Time Museum in Rockford, Illinois, US, and was included in their ''Catalogue of Chronometers''.<ref>{{cite book|last= Randall| first = Anthony G. | title = Time Museum Catalogue of Chronometers| edition= 1st | year = 1992 | publisher=The Time Museum | place = Rockford, Illinois |isbn = 978-0-91294703-7}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, inspired by this invention, the young German watchmaker Thomas Prescher developed for the Thomas Prescher Haute Horlogerie the first flying double-axis tourbillon in a pocket watch and, in 2004, the first flying double-axis tourbillon with constant force in the carriage in a wristwatch. Shown at the Baselworld 2003 and 2004 in Basel, Switzerland.\n\nA characteristic of this tourbillon is that it turns around two axes, both of which rotate once per minute.  The whole tourbillon is powered by a special constant-force mechanism, called a ''[[remontoire]]''.<ref name = \"Daniel\">{{Citation | first = George | last = Daniel | title = Watchmaking | publisher = Sotheby's | year = 1985 | isbn = 978-0-85667-497-6 | at = S. 264}}.</ref>  Prescher invented the constant-force mechanism to equalize the effects of a wound and unwound [[mainspring]], friction, and gravitation. Thereby even force is always supplied to the oscillation regulating system of the double-axis tourbillon. The device incorporates a modified system after a design by Henri Jeanneret.<ref name=\"Jeanneret\">{{Citation |first=Henri |last=Jeanneret |language=de |contribution=Hemmungstr\u00e4ger f\u00fcr industrielle Apparate mit gleich bleibendem Antrieb |trans-chapter=Inhibition support for industrial equipment with a constant drive |publisher=Verlag ART.

Both men had been working together since 1992 at Renaud & Papi, where they developed complicated watch movements. The Double Tourbillon 30\u00b0 features one tourbillon carriage rotating once per minute and inclined at 30\u00b0, inside another carriage which rotates once every four minutes. In 2005, Greubel Forsey presented their Quadruple Tourbillon \u00e0 Diff\u00e9rentiel (QDT), using two double-tourbillons working independently. A spherical differential connects the four rotating carriages, distributing torque between two wheels rotating at different speeds.\n\n===Triple-axis tourbillon===\n\n[[Image:Triple Axis Tourbillon Regulator Sport.jpg|thumb|Triple-Axis-Tourbillon Regulator Sport]]\nIn 2004, [[Thomas Prescher]] developed the first triple-axis tourbillon for the Thomas Prescher Haute Horlogerie<ref>{{Citation | publisher = Prescher | place = CH | title = Triple Axis Tourbillon | url = http://www.prescher.ch/Collection/Tourbillion/TripleAxisTourbillon/tabid/77/language/en-US/language/de-DE/Default.aspx}}.</ref> with constant force in the carriage in a wristwatch. It was presented at [[Baselworld]] 2004 in Basel, Switzerland, in a set of three watches including a single-axis, a double-axis and a triple-axis tourbillon.\n\nThe world's unique tri-axial tourbillon movement for wristwatch with traditional jewel bearings only was invented by the independent watchmaker Aaron Becsei, from Bexei Watches, in 2007.  The Primus wristwatch was presented at the [[Baselworld]] 2008 in Basel, Switzerland.<ref>{{Citation | title = About Aaron Becsei | url = http://www.bexei.hu/about.html | publisher = Bexei Watches | place = HU}}.</ref>  In the three axis tourbillon movement, the 3rd (external) cage has a unique form which provides the possibility of using jewel bearings everywhere, instead of ball-bearings. This is a unique solution at this size and level of complication.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.bexei.hu/primus_2_en.html | title = Primus | publisher = Bexei Watches | place = HU}}.</ref> There are a few wrist and pocket watches that include the Triple Axis or Tri-Axial Tourbillon escapements. Examples of companies and watchmakers that include this mechanism are Vianney Halter in his \"Deep Space\" watch, Thomas Prescher, Aaron Becsei, Girard-Perregaux with the \"Tri-Axial Tourbillon\" and Jaeger Le-Coultre with the \"Gyrotourbillon\".\n\n===Flying tourbillon===\nRather than being supported by a bridge, or cock, at both the top and bottom, the '''flying tourbillon''' is cantilevered, being only supported from one side. The first flying tourbillon was designed by Alfred Helwig, instructor at the German School of Watchmaking, in 1920.<ref>{{Citation | contribution-url = http://www.glashuette-original.com/meisterschaft/unvergaenglich/alfred_helwig/uhrmacher_helwig/ | publisher = Glassh\u00fctte original | title = Alfred Helwig | contribution = Uhrmacher Helwig | language = de}}.</ref>\n\nIn 1993, Kiu Tai-Yu, a [[Chinese people|Chinese]] watchmaker residing in [[Hong Kong]], created a semi-flying tourbillon with only an abbreviated carriage for the [[escapement]] wheel and [[pallet fork]], the upper pivot of the [[balance wheel]] being supported in a sapphire bridge.{{Citation needed |date=July 2015}}\n\n===Gyro tourbillon===\nJaeger-LeCoultre's first wristwatch tourbillon was introduced in 1993 (though JLC had produced tourbillons prior to that, including the famous observatory competition caliber 170) and in 2004 the company introduced the Gyrotourbillon I. Gyrotourbillon I is a double-axis tourbillon with a perpetual calendar and equation of time, and since then, Jaeger-LeCoultre has gone on to produce several variations on the multi-axis tourbillon theme. In general, however, these have been fairly thick watches (Gyrotourbillon I is 16mm thick) but with the Reverso Tribute Gyrotourbillon, JLC has produced a thinner and much more wearable version of its multi-axis tourbillon. At 51.1mm x 31mm x 12.4mm it's still not a small watch, but it is very comfortable on the wrist and certainly easier to wear than some of its predecessors.\n\n==Modern tourbillon watches==\nIn modern [[mechanical watch]] designs, a tourbillon is not required to produce a highly accurate timepiece; there is even debate amongst [[horology|horologists]] as to whether tourbillons ever improved the accuracy of mechanical time pieces, even when they were first introduced, or whether the time pieces of the day were inherently inaccurate due to design and manufacturing techniques.  Nevertheless, the tourbillon is one of the most valued features of collectors' watches and premium timepieces,<ref>{{Citation | date = August 2006 | title = WatchTime | format = article | contribution = [[Girard-Perregaux]]'s Tourbillon Icon}}.</ref> possibly for the same reason that mechanical watches fetch a much higher price than similar [[quartz]] [[Quartz watch|watches]] that are much more accurate.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://chronocentric.com/watches/accuracy.shtml |title = Chronocentric: Accuracy of Fine Wristwatches}}</ref>  High-quality tourbillon wristwatches, usually made by the [[Swiss watch|Swiss luxury watch]] industry, are very expensive, and typically retail for tens of thousands of [[dollars]] or [[euro]]s, with much higher prices in the hundreds of thousands of dollars or euros being common.  A recent renaissance of interest in tourbillons has been met by the industry with increased availability of time pieces bearing the feature, with the result that prices for basic tourbillon models have receded somewhat in recent years (whereas previously they were very rare, in either antiques or new merchandise); however, any time piece that has a tourbillon will cost a great deal more than an equivalent piece without the feature. Swiss models typically ''start'' at $40,000, and higher end tourbillon watches can be six figures, whereas some Chinese three-axis make and models range from hundreds to nearly $5000.<ref name=\"Swiss vis-\u00e0-vis Chinese pricing\">{{Cite web |url=https://gearpatrol.com/2016/03/04/why-tourbillon-watches-are-expensive/ |title=Why Do Tourbillons Cost a Small Fortune? The Movement That's Useless, Costly and Beloved |last=Conner |first=Andrew |date=2016-03-04 |website=Gear Patrol |access-date=2019-08-16}}</ref>\n\nModern implementations typically allow the tourbillon to be seen through a window in the watch face.  In addition to enhancing the charm of the piece, the tourbillon can act as a second hand for some watches as it generally rotates once per minute. However some tourbillons spin faster ([[Greubel Forsey|Greubel Forsey's]] 24-second tourbillon for example).  There are many watches that feature the oscillating balance wheel visible through the watch dial that are not tourbillons. This feature is often referred to as the \"open heart\" though it is often called a tourbillon by unscrupulous dealers (and tourbillon-style by scrupulous ones).\n\n<gallery widths=\"190px\" heights=\"200px\">\nImage:Jaeger Lecoultre img 0992.jpg|[[Jaeger-LeCoultre]] Tourbillon movement watch\nImage:GP tourbillon.jpg|Tourbillon with three gold bridges, [[Girard-Perregaux]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Improved affordability==\nSeveral Chinese manufacturers now produce a variety of tourbillon movements.<ref>{{cite web |title=Current Chinese Developments | work = Tourbillon | publisher = Traction ink |url=http://www.tractionink.com/watch_wiki/index.php?title=Tourbillon#Current_Chinese_Developments | accessdate =1 June 2010}}</ref> These movements are bought as [[\u00e9bauches]] by some manufacturers and are sometimes incorporated into watches that meet the requirements of the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry to be sold as Swiss Made, which requires 60% of the value to have been made in Switzerland.<ref>{{cite web |title=Swiss Made |publisher=Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry |url=http://www.fhs.ch/en/swissm.php |accessdate=December 21, 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100523071344/http://www.fhs.ch/en/swissm.php |archivedate=May 23, 2010 }}</ref> The availability of less expensive tourbillons has led industry spectators to worry that another [[quartz crisis]] may occur, where the Swiss watch industry will not be able to adapt quickly to less expensive complicated mechanical watches produced in other countries.<ref>{{cite web |title=New 'Quartz' Crisis Ahead? |author=Velociphile |work=Rolex |publisher=Watch pro site |date=August 7, 2005 |url=http://rolex.watchprosite.com/?show=forumpost&msid=317682&ti=287901&fi=128&pi=1878396 |accessdate=1 June 2010}}</ref> In 2016, TAG Heuer began offering the Carrera Heuer-02T tourbillon at a suggested retail price of 14,900 CHF (~US$15,000), significantly lower than the 100,000 CHF or more charged by some other established Swiss watch brands.<ref name=\"Bloom\">{{cite web|last1=Gretler|first1=Corinne|title=TAG Heuer to Undercut Rivals With Cheapest Swiss Tourbillon|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-28/tag-heuer-to-undercut-rivals-with-cheapest-swiss-tourbillon|website=Bloomberg Pursuits|accessdate=21 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n*  {{Cite journal\n| last1 = Denny | first1 = Mark \n| title = The Tourbillon and How It Works\n| doi = 10.1109/MCS.2010.936291 \n| journal = IEEE Control Systems Magazine \n| volume = 30 \n| issue = 3 \n| pages = 19\u201399 \n|date=June 2010\n| publisher = [[IEEE Control Systems Society]]\n}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/jaeger-lecoultre-reverso-tribute-gyrotourbillon-hands-on]\n\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n[[Category:Clocks]]\n[[Category:Horology]]\n[[Category:Swiss inventions]]\n[[Category:French inventions]]\n\n[[ru:\u041c\u0435\u0445\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u044b#\u0422\u0443\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0439\u043e\u043d]]\n", "name_user": "49.195.70.68", "label": "vandal", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourbillon"}

They created advergames for the Atari 2600 and gave out promotional copies.<ref name=\":19\" /> The first in-box CD-ROM cereal box advergames are General Mills's ''[[Chex Quest]]'' (promoting the [[Chex]] brand) and General Mills's ''All-Star baseball'' (starring Trix Rabbit and his friends playing baseball against [[Major League Baseball|Major League]] teams and stars).\n\nCommercial examples are numerous and include advergames funded by [[Pepsi]], [[7 Up]], [[National Football League|NFL]], [[Formula One]], and [[Burger King]]. Political and military examples of [[Below the line (advertising)|below-the-line]] (BTL) advergames include [[recruitment tool]]s like ''[[America's Army]]'', intended to boost recruitment for the [[United States Army]], and ''[[Special Force (Hezbollah)|Special Force]]'', intended to promote [[Muslim]] resistance to the state of [[Israel]]. Educational advergaming is closely related to the [[Serious game]]s initiative and falls under either [[Serious game#Classifications and subsets of serious games|Edumarket gaming]] or [[edutainment]]. Examples include ''[[Food Force]]'' (made by the [[United Nations]]'s World Food Program) and ''[[Urban Jungle]]'', an educational traffic simulation.\n\n===Through-the-line advertising===\n[[File:ILoveBees - Homepage.png|thumb|300px|''[[I Love Bees]]'' makes use of \"link-chasing\" and is designed to foster [[viral marketing]].]]\nExamples of [[Through the line|through-the-line]] (TTL) advertising in games include \"link-chases,\" [[Alternate reality games|ARG]]s, and [[viral marketing]].\n\nTTL marketing is a form of advertising in video games that involve the use of [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] [[hyperlink]]s within the game designed to induce the player to visit a webpage which then contains BTL advertisements. The technique used to tempt the player into visiting the intended URL varies from game to game.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.business2community.com/marketing/everything-need-know-atl-btl-ttl-advertising-01902793|title=Everything You Need to Know About ATL, BTL and TTL Advertising|work=Business 2 Community|access-date=2018-07-04}}</ref> In games like ''[[Pikmin 2]]'', the player is given a cryptic message with an accompanying URL designed to pique their curiosity. In games such as ''[[Enter the Matrix]]'', ''[[Year Zero (game)|Year Zero]]'', ''[[I Love Bees]]'', and ''[[Lost Experience]]'', URLs make up a part of the background of the game such that certain plot details can only be learned by following the link. The knowledge of such plot details are typically not required to complete the game, but deepen the game story-line for players who follow the links. Websites of this nature often lead players on to other links which again lead to further links, thus earning these games the label \"link-chases.\" The trade-off for TTL advertisers is that using the internet to find out further details about the game might be enjoyable, gamers will not enjoy being given too much of a run-around with too obtrusive advertising to obtain important details about the game.

Political and military examples of [[Below the line (advertising)|below-the-line]] (BTL) advergames include [[recruitment tool]]s like ''[[America's Army]]'', intended to boost recruitment for the [[United States Army]], and ''[[Special Force (Hezbollah)|Special Force]]'', intended to promote [[Muslim]] resistance to the state of [[Israel]]. Educational advergaming is closely related to the [[Serious game]]s initiative and falls under either [[Serious game#Classifications and subsets of serious games|Edumarket gaming]] or [[edutainment]].

In games such as ''[[Enter the Matrix]]'', ''[[Year Zero (game)|Year Zero]]'', ''[[I Love Bees]]'', and ''[[Lost Experience]]'', URLs make up a part of the background of the game such that certain plot details can only be learned by following the link. The knowledge of such plot details are typically not required to complete the game, but deepen the game story-line for players who follow the links. Websites of this nature often lead players on to other links which again lead to further links, thus earning these games the label \"link-chases.\" The trade-off for TTL advertisers is that using the internet to find out further details about the game might be enjoyable, gamers will not enjoy being given too much of a run-around with too obtrusive advertising to obtain important details about the game. In another form, the URL might be  part of a stage where a player can see it but it does not affect the plot. For example, in [[Super Monkey Ball 2]], there is a stage where you can see clearly written on an obstacle a URL and the stage's name is even the word URL.\n\n== Industry impact ==\n\n=== Prevalence and efficacy ===\nIn 2019, a survey conducted by [[deltaDNA]] found that 94% of free-to-play video game developers incorporate some form of in-game advertising.<ref name=\":23\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.pocketgamer.biz/data-and-research/72228/deltadna-in-game-advertising-study-2019/|title=94% of mobile devs use ads in their free-to-play games: deltaDNA's in-game advertising study 2019|last=|first=|date=|website=Pocket Gamer|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref> Among those, the most common type of advertisement were rewarded videos, which are videos that players can watch to earn in-game prizes.<ref name=\":23\" /> Rewarded videos are shown to be more effective than forced advertising; players are 23% more likely to buy products and 18% more likely to make in-app purchases when shown rewarded videos instead of forced advertising.<ref name=\":24\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/audiencenetwork/news-and-insights/how-do-gamers-feel-about-advertising|title=Game On: How do gamers feel about advertising?|last=Zins|first=Amelia|date=2017-08-22|website=facebook|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref> \n\nThe reaction to in-game advertising has been overall positive, with 73% of players being happy with ad-funded games.<ref name=\":24\" />\n\nThe effectiveness of advertising in video games is debated by scholars.<ref name=\":26\">{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=The Effectiveness of \"in-Game\" Advertising: Comparing College Students' Explicit and Implicit Memory for Brand Names|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.2753/JOA0091-3367350410?journalCode=ujoa20|journal=Journal of Advertising|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref><ref name=\":27\">{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Player performance and in game advertising retention|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220982765_Player_performance_and_in_game_advertising_retention|journal=Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Advances in Computer Entertainment Technology|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref><ref name=\":28\">{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Exploring Player Responses towards In-Game Advertising: The Impact of Interactivity|url=https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/8511151/file/8551807.pdf|journal=Ghent University Academic Bibliography|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> Brand name recognition in sports game has been shown to be low among college students, although players did retain fragments of the brand names.<ref name=\":26\" /> Another study found that 35% of players could recall advertised brands in car racing games.<ref name=\":27\" /> Interactive in-game advertisements, such as brand products that are used in game, are shown to produce greater brand awareness and more positive brand attitudes than passively added advertisements, such as posters or billboards.<ref name=\":28\" />\n\n=== Mobile ===\nMobile in-game advertisements are [[Advertising|advertisements]] within [[Mobile game|mobile games]] that lead the user to the website or installation page of the advertised product or software upon being clicked.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mobile-advertising.asp|title=What Is Mobile Advertising?|last=Kenton|first=Will|website=Investopedia|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> Mobile gaming advertisements can take different forms, including [[banner ads]], [[Pop-up ad|pop-up ads]], [[Video advertising|video ads]], and interactive ads.
