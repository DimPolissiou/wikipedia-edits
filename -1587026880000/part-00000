It is a miscellaneous science as it links [[health science]]s with [[pharmaceutical science]]s and [[natural science]]s. The professional practice is becoming more clinically oriented as most of the drugs are now manufactured by pharmaceutical industries. Based on the setting, the pharmacy is classified as a community or institutional pharmacy. Providing direct patient care in the community of institutional pharmacies are considered clinical pharmacy.<ref name=\"Thomas_2019\">{{cite book| vauthors = Thomas D | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Jp7DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA1|title=Clinical Pharmacy Education, Practice and Research | date = November 2018 | isbn = 9780128142769}}</ref>\n\nThe scope of pharmacy practice includes more traditional roles such as [[compounding]] and dispensing of medications, and it also includes more modern services related to [[health care]], including clinical services, reviewing medications for safety and efficacy, and providing [[drug]] information. [[Pharmacist]]s, therefore, are the experts on drug therapy and are the primary health professionals who optimize the use of medication for the benefit of the patients.\n\nAn establishment in which pharmacy (in the first sense) is practiced is called a ''pharmacy'' (this term is more common in the United States) or a ''chemist's'' (which is more common in Great Britain). In the United States and Canada, ''[[drugstore]]s'' commonly sell [[medicines]], as well as miscellaneous items such as [[confectionery]], [[cosmetics]], [[office supplies]], [[toy]]s, [[hair care]] products and [[magazine]]s and occasionally refreshments and groceries.\n\nIn its investigation of herbal and chemical ingredients, the work of the pharma may be regarded as a precursor of the modern sciences of [[chemistry]] and [[pharmacology]], prior to the formulation of the [[scientific method]].\n\n==Disciplines==\n[[File:42-aspetti di vita quotidiana, medicine,Taccuino Sanitatis, .jpg|thumb|Pharmacy, ''[[Tacuinum sanitatis]]'' casanatensis (14th century)]]\nThe field of pharmacy can generally be divided into three primary disciplines:\n*[[Pharmaceutics]] \n*[[Medicinal Chemistry]] and [[Pharmacognosy]]\n*Pharmacy Practice\n\nThe boundaries between these disciplines and with other sciences, such as biochemistry, are not always clear-cut.\nOften, collaborative teams from various disciplines (pharmacists and other scientists) work together toward the introduction of new therapeutics and methods for patient care. However, pharmacy is not a basic or biomedical science in its typical form. Medicinal chemistry is also a distinct branch of synthetic chemistry combining pharmacology, organic chemistry, and chemical biology.\n\n[[Pharmacology]] is sometimes considered as the 4th discipline of pharmacy. Although pharmacology is essential to the study of pharmacy, it is not specific to pharmacy. Both disciplines are distinct. Those who wish to practice both pharmacy (patient-oriented) and pharmacology (a biomedical science requiring the scientific method) receive separate training and degrees unique to either discipline.\n\n[[Pharmacoinformatics]] is considered another new discipline, for systematic drug discovery and development with efficiency and safety.\n\nPharmacogenomics is the study of genetic-linked variants that effect patient clinical responses, allergies, and metabolism of drugs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/genomicresearch/pharmacogenomics|title=What is pharmacogenomics?|last=Reference|first=Genetics Home|website=Genetics Home Reference|language=en|access-date=2019-11-20}}</ref>\n\n==Professionals==\nThe [[World Health Organization]] estimates that there are at least 2.6 million pharmacists and other pharmaceutical personnel worldwide.<ref>World Health Organization.

Pharmacists may also be [[small business|small-business]] proprietors, owning the pharmacy in which they practice. Since pharmacists know about the mode of action of a particular drug, and its metabolism and physiological effects on the human body in great detail, they play an important role in optimization of drug treatment for an individual.\n\nPharmacists are represented internationally by the [[International Pharmaceutical Federation]] (FIP). They are represented at the national level by [[professional body|professional organisations]] such as the [[Royal Pharmaceutical Society]] in the UK, [[Pharmacy Guild of Australia]] (PSA), [[Canadian Pharmacists Association]] (CPhA), [[Indian Pharmacist Association]] (IPA), [[Pakistan Pharmacists Association]] (PPA), and the [[American Pharmacists Association]] (APhA). (''See also: [[List of pharmacy associations]].)''\n\nIn some cases, the representative body is also the registering body, which is responsible for the regulation and [[ethics]] of the profession.\n\nIn the United States, specializations in pharmacy practice recognized by the [[Board of Pharmacy Specialties]] include: cardiovascular, [[infectious disease]], [[oncology]], pharmacotherapy, nuclear, [[nutrition]], and [[psychiatry]].<ref>Board of Pharmacy Specialties, [http://www.bpsweb.org/03_Specialties_Current.html, Current Specialties]</ref> The [[Commission for Certification in Geriatric Pharmacy]] certifies pharmacists in geriatric pharmacy practice. The [[American Board of Applied Toxicology]] certifies pharmacists and other medical professionals in applied [[toxicology]].\n\n===Pharmacy technicians===\n{{Main|Pharmacy technician}}\n\nPharmacy technicians support the work of pharmacists and other health professionals by performing a variety of pharmacy-related functions, including dispensing prescription drugs and other medical devices to patients and instructing on their use. They may also perform administrative duties in pharmaceutical practice, such as reviewing prescription requests with medic's offices and insurance companies to ensure correct medications are provided and payment is received.\n\nA Pharmacy Technician in the UK has recently been referred to by some as a professional. Legislation requires the supervision of certain pharmacy technician's activities by a pharmacist. The majority of pharmacy technicians work in community pharmacies. In hospital pharmacies, pharmacy technicians may be managed by other senior pharmacy technicians. In the UK the role of a PhT in hospital pharmacy has grown and responsibility has been passed on to them to manage the pharmacy department and specialized areas in pharmacy practice allowing pharmacists the time to specialize in their expert field as medication consultants spending more time working with patients and in research. Pharmacy technicians are registered with the General Pharmaceutical Council (GPhC). The GPhC is the regulator of pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, and pharmacy premises.\n\nIn the US, pharmacy technicians perform their duties under the supervision of pharmacists. Although they may perform, under supervision, most dispensing, compounding and other tasks, they are not generally allowed to perform the role of counseling patients on the proper use of their medications.\n\n== Education requirements ==\n{{Globalize|section|date=December 2019}}\nThere are different requirements of schooling according to the national jurisdiction where the student intends to practise.\n\n===United States===\n<!-- It appears that there is also a Batchelor degree but if so then it needs its own citation -->\nIn the United States, general pharmacist will attain a Doctor of Pharmacy Degree (Pharm.D.).

In a student's third professional year in pharmacy school, it is required to pass the Pharmacy Curriculum Outcomes Assessment (PCOA). Once the Pharm.D. is attained after the fourth year professional school, the student is then eligible to take the North American Pharmacist Licensure Exam (NAPLEX) and the Multistate Pharmacy Jurisprudence Exam (MPJE) to work as a professional pharmacist.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pharmacy.ku.edu/sites/pharmacy.ku.edu/files/files/student%20handbooks/2017-2018%20Student%20Handbook%20v2017_08_18.pdf|title=Pharmacy Student Handbook 2017\u20132018|date=August 2017|website=KU Pharmacy|accessdate=6 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of pharmacy|List of pharmacists}}\n[[File:Legenogapotekeren.jpg|thumb|Physician and Pharmacist, illustration from ''Medicinarius'' (1505) by [[Hieronymus Brunschwig]].]]\n<!-- Commented out: [[File:Scientific chemistry and pharmacy.jpg|thumb|Pharmacy in medieval [[Muslim world]].]] -->\n\nThe earliest known compilation of medicinal substances was the ''[[Sushruta Samhita]]'', an Indian [[Ayurveda|Ayurvedic treatise]] attributed to [[Sushruta]] in the 6th century BC.

The Latin translation ''[[De Materia Medica (Dioscorides)|De Materia Medica]]'' (''Concerning medical substances'') was used a basis for many medieval texts and was built upon by many middle eastern scientists during the [[Islamic Golden Age]].\n\n[[Pharmacy in China]] dates at least to the earliest known Chinese manual, the ''Shennong Bencao Jing'' (''The Divine Farmer's Herb-Root Classic''), dating back to the 1st century AD. It was compiled during the [[Han dynasty]] and was attributed to the mythical [[Shennong]]. Earlier literature included lists of prescriptions for specific ailments, exemplified by a manuscript \"Recipes for 52 Ailments\", found in the [[Mawangdui]], sealed in 168 BC.\n\nIn Japan, at the end of the [[Asuka period]] (538\u2013710) and the early [[Nara period]] (710\u2013794), the men who fulfilled roles similar to those of modern pharmacists were highly respected.  The place of pharmacists in society was expressly defined in the [[Taih\u014d Code]] (701) and re-stated in the [[Y\u014dr\u014d Code]] (718).  Ranked positions in the pre-[[Heian period|Heian]] Imperial court were established; and this organizational structure remained largely intact until the [[Meiji Restoration]] (1868).  In this highly stable hierarchy, the pharmacists\u2014and even pharmacist assistants\u2014were assigned status superior to all others in health-related fields such as physicians and acupuncturists. In the Imperial household, the pharmacist was even ranked above the two personal physicians of the Emperor.<ref>Titsingh, Isaac.

[[Muhammad ibn Zakar\u012bya R\u0101zi]] (Rhazes) (865\u2013915), for instance, acted to promote the medical uses of chemical compounds. [[Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi]] (Abulcasis) (936\u20131013) pioneered the preparation of medicines by [[Sublimation (chemistry)|sublimation]] and [[distillation]]. His ''Liber servitoris'' is of particular interest, as it provides the reader with recipes and explains how to prepare the 'simples' from which were [[compounding|compounded]] the complex drugs then generally used. Sabur Ibn Sahl (d 869), was, however, the first physician to initiate pharmacopoedia, describing a large variety of drugs and remedies for ailments. [[Al-Biruni]] (973\u20131050) wrote one of the most valuable Islamic works on pharmacology, entitled ''Kitab al-Saydalah'' (''The Book of Drugs''), in which he detailed the properties of drugs and outlined the role of pharmacy and the functions and duties of the pharmacist. [[Avicenna]], too, described no less than 700 preparations, their properties, modes of action, and their indications. He devoted in fact a whole volume to simple drugs in ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]''. Of great impact were also the works by [[Masawaih al-Mardini|al-Maridini of Baghdad]] and [[Cairo]], and [[Ibn al-Wafid]] (1008\u20131074), both of which were printed in [[Latin]] more than fifty times, appearing as ''De Medicinis universalibus et particularibus'' by '[[Mesue]]' the younger, and the ''Medicamentis simplicibus'' by '[[Abenguefit]]'. [[Peter of Abano]] (1250\u20131316) translated and added a supplement to the work of al-Maridini under the title ''De Veneris''. Al-Muwaffaq's contributions in the field are also pioneering. Living in the 10th century, he wrote ''The foundations of the true properties of Remedies'', amongst others describing [[arsenious oxide]], and being acquainted with [[silicic acid]]. He made clear distinction between [[sodium carbonate]] and [[potassium carbonate]], and drew attention to the poisonous nature of [[copper]] compounds, especially copper [[vitriol]], and also [[lead]] compounds. He also describes the [[Distilled water|distillation of sea-water]] for drinking.<ref>Levey M. (1973), \u2018 Early Arabic Pharmacology', E. J.

It is the community pharmacy in which the dichotomy of the profession exists; health professionals who are also retailers.\n\n[[Community pharmacy|Community pharmacies]] usually consist of a retail storefront with a dispensary, where medications are stored and dispensed. According to Sharif Kaf al-Ghazal, the opening of the first drugstores are recorded by [[Islamic medicine|Muslim]] pharmacists in [[Baghdad]] in 754 AD.<ref name=Hadzovic /><ref>Sharif Kaf al-Ghazal, ''Journal of the International Society for the History of Islamic Medicine'', 2004 (3), pp. 3\u20139 [8].</ref>\n\nIn most countries, the dispensary is subject to pharmacy legislation; with requirements for storage conditions, compulsory texts, equipment, etc., specified in legislation. It was once the case that pharmacists stayed within the dispensary compounding/dispensing medications, but there has been an increasing trend towards the use of trained [[pharmacy technician]]s, with the pharmacist spending more time communicating with patients. Pharmacy technicians are now more dependent upon automation to assist them in their new role dealing with patients' prescriptions and patient safety issues.\n\nPharmacies are typically required to have a pharmacist on-duty at all times when they are open. It is also often a requirement for the owner of a pharmacy to be a registered pharmacist, but that is not the case in all jurisdictions, such that many [[retailer]]s (including [[supermarket]]s and [[Discount retail store|mass merchandiser]]s) now include a pharmacy as a department of their store.\n\nLikewise, many pharmacies are now rather grocery store-like in their design. In addition to medicines and prescriptions, many now sell a diverse arrangement of additional items such as [[cosmetics]], [[shampoo]], [[office supplies]], [[confections]], [[snack foods]], [[durable medical equipment]], [[greeting cards]], and provide [[photo processing]] services.\n\nCommunity pharmacies offer a unique added value by building direct relationships with their customers. They are able to provide more personalized, dedicated care to local members of their community and even offer enhanced services such as Medication Therapy Management (MTM), Medication Synchronization, and compounding. With the aid of [[pharmacy management system]]s and different integrated technologies, these smaller pharmacies are able to keep up with their large-scale competition. \n \nIn community pharmacy, [[Medical prescription|prescription]]s, [[medical devices]] and other [[over the counter]] products are dispensed by community pharmacists.

Some pharmacists in hospital pharmacies may have more complex clinical medication management issues, and pharmacists in community pharmacies often have more complex business and customer relations issues.\n\nBecause of the complexity of medications including specific indications, effectiveness of treatment regimens, safety of medications (i.e., drug interactions) and [[patient compliance]] issues (in the hospital and at home), many pharmacists practicing in hospitals gain more education and training after pharmacy school through a pharmacy practice residency and sometimes followed by another residency in a specific area. Those pharmacists are often referred to as clinical pharmacists and they often specialize in various disciplines of pharmacy.\n\nFor example, there are pharmacists who specialize in hematology/oncology, HIV/AIDS, infectious disease, critical care, [[emergency medicine]], toxicology, nuclear pharmacy, pain management, psychiatry, anti-coagulation clinics, [[Herbalism|herbal medicine]], neurology/epilepsy management, pediatrics, neonatal pharmacists and more.\n\nHospital pharmacies can often be found within the premises of the hospital. Hospital pharmacies usually stock a larger range of medications, including more specialized medications, than would be feasible in the community setting. Most hospital medications are unit-dose, or a single dose of medicine.  Hospital pharmacists and trained pharmacy technicians compound sterile products for patients including [[total parenteral nutrition]] (TPN), and other medications are given intravenously. That is a complex process that requires adequate training of personnel, [[Quality Assurance|quality assurance]] of products, and adequate facilities.\n\nSeveral hospital pharmacies have decided to [[outsource]] high-risk preparations and some other compounding functions to companies who specialize in compounding. The high cost of medications and drug-related technology and the potential impact of medications and pharmacy services on patient-care outcomes and patient safety require hospital pharmacies to perform at the highest level possible.\n\n===Clinical pharmacy===\n{{Main|Clinical pharmacy}}\n[[Pharmacists]] provide direct patient care services that optimize the use of medication and promotes health, wellness, and disease prevention.<ref>{{cite journal | author = | year = 2008 | title = The definition of clinical pharmacy | url = http://www.accp.com/docs/positions/commentaries/Clinpharmdefnfinal.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Pharmacotherapy | volume = 28 | issue = 6| pages = 816\u2013817 }}</ref> [[Clinical pharmacist]]s care for patients in all [[health care]] settings, but the clinical pharmacy movement initially began inside [[hospital]]s and [[clinic]]s. Clinical pharmacists often collaborate with [[physician]]s and other healthcare professionals to improve pharmaceutical care. Clinical pharmacists are now an integral part of the interdisciplinary approach to patient care. They often participate in patient care rounds for drug product selection.\n\nThe clinical pharmacist's role involves creating a comprehensive drug therapy plan for patient-specific problems, identifying goals of therapy, and reviewing all prescribed medications prior to dispensing and administration to the patient. The review process often involves an evaluation of the appropriateness of drug therapy (e.g., drug choice, dose, route, frequency, and duration of therapy) and its efficacy. The pharmacist must also monitor for potential drug interactions, adverse drug reactions, and assess patient drug allergies while they design and initiate a drug therapy plan.<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Burke JM, Miller WA, Spencer AP, etal | year = 2008 | title = Clinical pharmacist competencies | url = http://www.accp.com/docs/positions/whitePapers/CliniPharmCompTFfinalDraft.pdf | journal = Pharmacotherapy | volume = 28 | issue = 6| pages = 806\u2013815 | doi=10.1592/phco.28.6.806| pmid = 18503407 }}</ref>\n\n===Ambulatory care pharmacy===\nSince the emergence of modern clinical pharmacy, ambulatory care pharmacy practice has emerged as a unique pharmacy practice setting. Ambulatory care pharmacy is based primarily on pharmacotherapy services that a pharmacist provides in a clinic. Pharmacists in this setting often do not dispense drugs, but rather see patients in-office visits to manage chronic disease states.\n\nIn the U.S. federal health care system (including the VA, the Indian Health Service, and NIH) ambulatory care pharmacists are given full independent prescribing authority. In some states such [[North Carolina]] and [[New Mexico]] these pharmacist clinicians are given collaborative prescriptive and diagnostic authority.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 15719585 | year = 2005 | last1 = Knapp | first1 = KK | last2 = Okamoto | first2 = MP | last3 = Black | first3 = BL | title = ASHP survey of ambulatory care pharmacy practice in health systems\u20142004 | volume = 62 | issue = 3 | pages = 274\u201384 | journal = American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy | doi=10.1093/ajhp/62.3.274}}</ref> In 2011 the board of Pharmaceutical Specialties approved ambulatory care pharmacy practice as a separate board certification.

This may include altering the strength, ingredients, or dosage form.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Research|first=Center for Drug Evaluation and|date=2018-11-03|title=Compounding and the FDA: Questions and Answers|url=https://www.fda.gov/drugs/human-drug-compounding/compounding-and-fda-questions-and-answers|journal=FDA|language=en}}</ref> Compounding is a way to create custom drugs for patients who may not be able to take the medication in its standard form, such as due to an allergy or difficulty swallowing. Compounding is necessary for these patients to still be able to properly get the prescriptions they need.\n\nOne area of compounding is preparing drugs in new dosage forms. For example, if a drug manufacturer only provides a drug as a tablet, a compounding pharmacist might make a medicated [[lollipop]] that contains the drug. Patients who have difficulty swallowing the tablet may prefer to suck the medicated lollipop instead.\n\nAnother form of compounding is by mixing different strengths (g, mg, mcg) of capsules or tablets to yield the desired amount of medication indicated by the [[physician]], [[physician assistant]], [[Nurse Practitioner]], or [[clinical pharmacist practitioner]]. This form of compounding is found at community or hospital pharmacies or in-home administration therapy.\n\nCompounding pharmacies specialize in compounding, although many also dispense the same non-compounded drugs that patients can obtain from community pharmacies.\n\n===Consultant pharmacy===\n{{Main|Consultant pharmacist}}\n{{Globalize|section|date=December 2019}}\nConsultant pharmacy practice focuses more on medication regimen review (i.e. \"cognitive services\") than on actual dispensing of drugs. Consultant pharmacists most typically work in [[nursing home]]s, but are increasingly branching into other institutions and non-institutional settings.<ref>American Society of Consultant Pharmacists, [http://www.ascp.com/about/ascpfactsheet.cfm Frequently Asked Questions]</ref> Traditionally{{where|date=December 2019}} consultant pharmacists were usually independent business owners, though in the United States many now work for a large pharmacy management company such as [[Omnicare]], [[Kindred Healthcare]] or [[PharMerica]]. This trend may be gradually reversing{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} as consultant pharmacists begin to work directly with patients, primarily because many elderly people are now taking numerous medications but continue to live outside of institutional settings. Some community pharmacies employ consultant pharmacists and/or provide consulting services.\n\nThe main principle of consultant pharmacy is developed by Hepler and Strand in 1990.<ref name=\"Pharmaceutical care and patient outcomes\">{{Cite journal|author=Strand LM |title=Pharmaceutical care and patient outcomes: notes on what it is we manage |journal=Top Hosp Pharm Manage. |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=77\u201384 |year=1990 |pmid=10128568 }}</ref><ref name=\"Responsibilities in pharmaceutical care\">{{Cite journal|vauthors=Hepler CD, Strand LM |title=Opportunities and responsibilities in pharmaceutical care |journal=Am J Hosp Pharm |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=533\u201343 |year=1990 |pmid=2316538 }}</ref>\n\n===Internet pharmacy===\n{{Main|Online pharmacy}}\n[[File:Mail order pharmacy dispensers.jpg|right|thumb|Canisters of pills from a mail order pharmacy.]]\nSince about the year 2000, a growing number of [[Internet]] pharmacies have been established worldwide.  Many of these pharmacies are similar to community pharmacies, and in fact, many of them are actually operated by [[Bricks and mortar business|brick-and-mortar]] community pharmacies that serve consumers online and those that walk in their door.  The primary difference is the method by which the medications are requested and received. Some customers consider this to be more convenient and private method rather than traveling to a community drugstore where another customer might overhear about the drugs that they take. Internet pharmacies (also known as online pharmacies) are also recommended to some patients by their physicians if they are home-bound.\n\nWhile most Internet pharmacies sell [[prescription drug]]s and require a valid prescription, some Internet pharmacies sell prescription drugs without requiring a prescription.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}  Some customers order drugs from such pharmacies to avoid the \"inconvenience\" of visiting a doctor, or to obtain medications which their doctors were unwilling to prescribe. However, this practice has been criticized as potentially dangerous, especially by those who feel that only doctors can reliably assess contraindications, risk/benefit ratios, and an individual's overall suitability for use of medication. There also have been reports of such pharmacies dispensing substandard products.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/downloads/ForHealthProfessionals/UCM330640.pdf|title=Protecting Patients from Counterfeit and Other Substandard Drugs/Supply Chain Threats}}</ref>\n\nOf particular concern with Internet pharmacies is the ease with which people, youth in particular, can obtain [[controlled substances]] (e.g., [[Vicodin]], generically known as [[hydrocodone]]) via the Internet without a prescription issued by a doctor/practitioner who has an established doctor-patient relationship.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}  There are instances where a practitioner issues a prescription, brokered by an Internet server, for a controlled substance to a \"patient\" s/he has never met.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} In the United States, in order for a prescription for a controlled substance to be valid, it must be issued for a legitimate medical purpose by a licensed practitioner acting in the course of legitimate doctor-patient relationship. The filling pharmacy has a corresponding responsibility to ensure that the prescription is valid. Often, individual state laws outline what defines a valid patient-doctor relationship. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is also heavily involved in monitoring internet pharmacies and has issued warnings against several companies who have violated the U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act that protects individuals against rogue online pharmacies.\n\nCanada is home to dozens of licensed Internet pharmacies, many of which sell their lower-cost prescription drugs to U.S. consumers (who must otherwise pay one of the world's highest drug prices).<ref>London Free Press Regional News Archive, [http://canada.regional-news.org/2005-11-canada-internet-pharmacy-merged-in-38-million-deal.html Canada Internet Pharmacy Merged In $3.8 Million Deal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426022604/http://canada.regional-news.org/2005-11-canada-internet-pharmacy-merged-in-38-million-deal.html |date=26 April 2012 }}</ref> In recent years, many consumers in the US (and in other countries with high drug costs), have turned to licensed Internet pharmacies in India, Israel, and the UK, which often have even lower prices than in Canada.\n\nIn the [[United States]], there has been a push to legalize the importation of medications from [[Canada]] and other countries,{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} in order to reduce consumer costs. While in most cases importation of prescription medications violates [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) regulations and federal laws, enforcement is generally targeted at international drug suppliers, rather than consumers.  There is no known case of any U.S. citizens buying Canadian drugs for personal use with a prescription, who has ever been charged by authorities.\n\n===Veterinary pharmacy===\n{{Main|Veterinary pharmacy}}\nVeterinary pharmacies, sometimes called ''animal pharmacies'', may fall in the category of hospital pharmacy, retail pharmacy or mail-order pharmacy. Veterinary pharmacies stock different varieties and different strengths of medications to fulfill the pharmaceutical needs of animals.  Because the needs of animals, as well as the regulations on [[veterinary medicine]], are often very different from those related to people, in some jurisdictions veterinary pharmacy may be  kept separate from regular pharmacies.\n\n===Nuclear pharmacy===\n{{Main|Nuclear pharmacy}}\nNuclear pharmacy focuses on preparing radioactive materials for diagnostic tests and for treating certain diseases. Nuclear pharmacists undergo additional training specific to handling radioactive materials, and unlike in community and hospital pharmacies, nuclear pharmacists typically do not interact directly with patients.\n\n===Military pharmacy===\n{{Globalize|section|date=December 2019}}\n[[File:332nd EMSG Pharmacy Tech DVIDS328212.jpg|thumb|Airman 1st Class Breanna DeMasters and Staff Sgt.

Importantly, as [[knowledge]] advances, boundaries between these specialty areas of pharmaceutical sciences are beginning to blur. Many fundamental concepts are common to all pharmaceutical sciences. These shared fundamental concepts further the understanding of their applicability to all aspects of [[pharmaceutical research]] and [[drug therapy]].\n\n[[Pharmacocybernetics]] (also known as pharma-cybernetics, cybernetic pharmacy, and cyber pharmacy) is an emerging field that describes the science of supporting drugs and medications use through the application and evaluation of informatics and internet technologies, so as to improve the [[pharmaceutical care]] of patients.<ref name=\"Yap Pharmaco-cybernetics as an interactive component of pharma-culture\">{{cite journal | author = Yap KY, Chuang X, Lee AJM, Lee RZ, Lim L, Lim JJ, Nimesha R | year = 2009 | title = Pharmaco-cybernetics as an interactive component of pharma-culture: empowering drug knowledge through user-, experience- and activity-centered designs | url = | journal = International Journal of Computer Science Issues | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 1\u201313 }}</ref>\n\n==Society and culture==\n\n===Etymology<!--Linked from 'Pharmacology' and 'Pharmakos'-->===\nThe word ''pharmacy'' is derived from [[Old French]] ''farmacie'' \"substance, such as a food or in the form of a medicine which has a laxative effect\" from [[Medieval Latin]] ''pharmacia'' from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''pharmakeia'' ({{lang-grc-gre|\u03c6\u03b1\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03af\u03b1}}) \"a medicine\", which itself derives from ''pharmakon'' ({{lang|grc|\u03c6\u03ac\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd}}), meaning \"drug, [[poison]], [[Spell (paranormal)|spell]]\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/pharmacy|title=pharmacy &#124; Origin and meaning of pharmacy by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com}}</ref><ref>{{LSJ|fa/rmakon|\u03c6\u03ac\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd|ref}}.</ref>{{refn|group=n|Its earliest attested form in Greek could be the [[Mycenaean Greek|Mycenaean]] {{lang|gmy|\ud800\udc1e\ud800\udc14\ud800\udc12}}, ''pa-ma-ko'', written in the [[Linear B]] syllabic script and found on the [[Pylos|PY]] Un 1314 tablet; this tablet is also found listed as PY Vn 1314 or PY Sb 1314.<ref>{{cite web|title=PY 1314 Vn + frr.

In Asian countries, it is traditional for physicians to also provide drugs.\n\nIn contemporary time researchers and health policy analysts have more deeply considered these traditions and their effects. Advocates for separation and advocates for combining make similar claims for each of their conflicting perspectives, saying that separating or combining reduces [[conflict of interest in the healthcare industry]], [[unnecessary health care]], and lowers costs, while the opposite causes those things. Research in various places reports mixed outcomes in different circumstances.\n\n===The future of pharmacy===\n[[File:A U.S. Soldier with the Special Warfare Medical Group(Airborne), speaks to Dr 110228-A-GV060-946.jpg|thumb|Pharmacists now go on rounds with doctors and have more patient interaction.]]\nIn the coming decades, pharmacists are expected to become more integral within the [[health care system]]. Rather than simply dispensing medication, pharmacists are increasingly expected to be compensated for their patient care skills.<ref>American College of Clinical Pharmacy, [http://www.accp.com/position/pos029.pdf Evidence of the Economic Benefit of Clinical Pharmacy Services:  1996\u20132000]</ref> In particular, [[Medication Therapy Management]] (MTM) includes the clinical services that pharmacists can provide for their patients.  Such services include a thorough analysis of all medication ([[prescription medication|prescription]], non-prescription, and herbals) currently being taken by an individual.  The result is a reconciliation of medication and patient education resulting in increased patient health outcomes and decreased costs to the health care system.<ref>American Pharmacy Student Alliance (APSA){{Unreliable source?|date=July 2011}}</ref>\n\nThis shift has already commenced in some countries; for instance, pharmacists in [[Australia]] receive remuneration from the [[Government of Australia|Australian Government]] for conducting comprehensive Home Medicines Reviews. In Canada, pharmacists in certain provinces have limited prescribing rights (as in Alberta and British Columbia) or are remunerated by their provincial government for expanded services such as medications reviews (Medschecks in Ontario). In the United Kingdom, pharmacists who undertake additional training are obtaining prescribing rights and this is because of [[pharmacy education]]. They are also being paid for by the government for [[medicine use review]]s. In Scotland, the pharmacist can write prescriptions for Scottish registered patients of their regular medications, for the majority of drugs, except for controlled drugs, when the patient is unable to see their doctor, as could happen if they are away from home or the doctor is unavailable. In the United States, pharmaceutical care or [[clinical pharmacy]] has had an evolving influence on the practice of pharmacy.<ref name=\"Clinical Pharmacy Defined\">American College of Clinical Pharmacy, [http://www.accp.com/clinical_pharmacy.php Clinical Pharmacy Defined]</ref> Moreover, the [[Doctor of Pharmacy]] (Pharm. D.) degree is now required before entering practice and some pharmacists now complete one or two years of residency or fellowship training following graduation.  In addition, [[consultant pharmacist]]s, who traditionally operated primarily in [[nursing home]]s are now expanding into direct consultation with patients, under the banner of \"senior care pharmacy\".<ref>[[American Society of Consultant Pharmacists]], [http://www.ascp.com/consumers/what/ What is a Senior Care Pharmacist?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061023213917/http://www.ascp.com/consumers/what/ |date=23 October 2006 }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to patient care, pharmacies will be a focal point for medical adherence initiatives.

It is a miscellaneous science as it links [[health science]]s with [[pharmaceutical science]]s and [[natural science]]s. The professional practice is becoming more clinically oriented as most of the drugs are now manufactured by pharmaceutical industries. Based on the setting, the pharmacy is classified as a community or institutional pharmacy. Providing direct patient care in the community of institutional pharmacies are considered clinical pharmacy.<ref name=\"Thomas_2019\">{{cite book| vauthors = Thomas D | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Jp7DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA1|title=Clinical Pharmacy Education, Practice and Research | date = November 2018 | isbn = 9780128142769}}</ref>\n\nThe scope of pharmacy practice includes more traditional roles such as [[compounding]] and dispensing of medications, and it also includes more modern services related to [[health care]], including clinical services, reviewing medications for safety and efficacy, and providing [[drug]] information. [[Pharmacist]]s, therefore, are the experts on drug therapy and are the primary health professionals who optimize the use of medication for the benefit of the patients.\n\nAn establishment in which pharmacy (in the first sense) is practiced is called a ''pharmacy'' (this term is more common in the United States) or a ''chemist's'' (which is more common in Great Britain). In the United States and Canada, ''[[drugstore]]s'' commonly sell [[medicines]], as well as miscellaneous items such as [[confectionery]], [[cosmetics]], [[office supplies]], [[toy]]s, [[hair care]] products and [[magazine]]s and occasionally refreshments and groceries.\n\nIn its investigation of herbal and chemical ingredients, the work of the pharma may be regarded as a precursor of the modern sciences of [[chemistry]] and [[pharmacology]], prior to the formulation of the [[scientific method]].\n\n==Disciplines==\n[[File:42-aspetti di vita quotidiana, medicine,Taccuino Sanitatis, .jpg|thumb|Pharmacy, ''[[Tacuinum sanitatis]]'' casanatensis (14th century)]]\nThe field of pharmacy can generally be divided into three primary disciplines:\n*[[Pharmaceutics]] \n*[[Medicinal Chemistry]] and [[Pharmacognosy]]\n*Pharmacy Practice\n\nThe boundaries between these disciplines and with other sciences, such as biochemistry, are not always clear-cut.\nOften, collaborative teams from various disciplines (pharmacists and other scientists) work together toward the introduction of new therapeutics and methods for patient care. However, pharmacy is not a basic or biomedical science in its typical form. Medicinal chemistry is also a distinct branch of synthetic chemistry combining pharmacology, organic chemistry, and chemical biology.\n\n[[Pharmacology]] is sometimes considered as the 4th discipline of pharmacy. Although pharmacology is essential to the study of pharmacy, it is not specific to pharmacy. Both disciplines are distinct. Those who wish to practice both pharmacy (patient-oriented) and pharmacology (a biomedical science requiring the scientific method) receive separate training and degrees unique to either discipline.\n\n[[Pharmacoinformatics]] is considered another new discipline, for systematic drug discovery and development with efficiency and safety.\n\nPharmacogenomics is the study of genetic-linked variants that effect patient clinical responses, allergies, and metabolism of drugs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/genomicresearch/pharmacogenomics|title=What is pharmacogenomics?|last=Reference|first=Genetics Home|website=Genetics Home Reference|language=en|access-date=2019-11-20}}</ref>\n\n==Professionals==\nThe [[World Health Organization]] estimates that there are at least 2.6 million pharmacists and other pharmaceutical personnel worldwide.<ref>World Health Organization.

Pharmacists may also be [[small business|small-business]] proprietors, owning the pharmacy in which they practice. Since pharmacists know about the mode of action of a particular drug, and its metabolism and physiological effects on the human body in great detail, they play an important role in optimization of drug treatment for an individual.\n\nPharmacists are represented internationally by the [[International Pharmaceutical Federation]] (FIP). They are represented at the national level by [[professional body|professional organisations]] such as the [[Royal Pharmaceutical Society]] in the UK, [[Pharmacy Guild of Australia]] (PSA), [[Canadian Pharmacists Association]] (CPhA), [[Indian Pharmacist Association]] (IPA), [[Pakistan Pharmacists Association]] (PPA), and the [[American Pharmacists Association]] (APhA). (''See also: [[List of pharmacy associations]].)''\n\nIn some cases, the representative body is also the registering body, which is responsible for the regulation and [[ethics]] of the profession.\n\nIn the United States, specializations in pharmacy practice recognized by the [[Board of Pharmacy Specialties]] include: cardiovascular, [[infectious disease]], [[oncology]], pharmacotherapy, nuclear, [[nutrition]], and [[psychiatry]].<ref>Board of Pharmacy Specialties, [http://www.bpsweb.org/03_Specialties_Current.html, Current Specialties]</ref> The [[Commission for Certification in Geriatric Pharmacy]] certifies pharmacists in geriatric pharmacy practice. The [[American Board of Applied Toxicology]] certifies pharmacists and other medical professionals in applied [[toxicology]].\n\n===Pharmacy technicians===\n{{Main|Pharmacy technician}}\n\nPharmacy technicians support the work of pharmacists and other health professionals by performing a variety of pharmacy-related functions, including dispensing prescription drugs and other medical devices to patients and instructing on their use. They may also perform administrative duties in pharmaceutical practice, such as reviewing prescription requests with medic's offices and insurance companies to ensure correct medications are provided and payment is received.\n\nA Pharmacy Technician in the UK has recently been referred to by some as a professional. Legislation requires the supervision of certain pharmacy technician's activities by a pharmacist. The majority of pharmacy technicians work in community pharmacies. In hospital pharmacies, pharmacy technicians may be managed by other senior pharmacy technicians. In the UK the role of a PhT in hospital pharmacy has grown and responsibility has been passed on to them to manage the pharmacy department and specialized areas in pharmacy practice allowing pharmacists the time to specialize in their expert field as medication consultants spending more time working with patients and in research. Pharmacy technicians are registered with the General Pharmaceutical Council (GPhC). The GPhC is the regulator of pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, and pharmacy premises.\n\nIn the US, pharmacy technicians perform their duties under the supervision of pharmacists. Although they may perform, under supervision, most dispensing, compounding and other tasks, they are not generally allowed to perform the role of counseling patients on the proper use of their medications.\n\n== Education requirements ==\n{{Globalize|section|date=December 2019}}\nThere are different requirements of schooling according to the national jurisdiction where the student intends to practise.\n\n===United States===\n<!-- It appears that there is also a Batchelor degree but if so then it needs its own citation -->\nIn the United States, general pharmacist will attain a Doctor of Pharmacy Degree (Pharm.D.).

There are a series of required standardized tests that students have to pass throughout the process of pharmacy school. The standardized test to get into pharmacy school in the United States is called the Pharmacy College Admission Test (PCAT). In a student's third professional year in pharmacy school, it is required to pass the Pharmacy Curriculum Outcomes Assessment (PCOA). Once the Pharm.D. is attained after the fourth year professional school, the student is then eligible to take the North American Pharmacist Licensure Exam (NAPLEX) and the Multistate Pharmacy Jurisprudence Exam (MPJE) to work as a professional pharmacist.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pharmacy.ku.edu/sites/pharmacy.ku.edu/files/files/student%20handbooks/2017-2018%20Student%20Handbook%20v2017_08_18.pdf|title=Pharmacy Student Handbook 2017\u20132018|date=August 2017|website=KU Pharmacy|accessdate=6 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of pharmacy|List of pharmacists}}\n[[File:Legenogapotekeren.jpg|thumb|Physician and Pharmacist, illustration from ''Medicinarius'' (1505) by [[Hieronymus Brunschwig]].]]\n<!-- Commented out: [[File:Scientific chemistry and pharmacy.jpg|thumb|Pharmacy in medieval [[Muslim world]].]] -->\n\nThe earliest known compilation of medicinal substances was the ''[[Sushruta Samhita]]'', an Indian [[Ayurveda|Ayurvedic treatise]] attributed to [[Sushruta]] in the 6th century BC.

The Latin translation ''[[De Materia Medica (Dioscorides)|De Materia Medica]]'' (''Concerning medical substances'') was used a basis for many medieval texts and was built upon by many middle eastern scientists during the [[Islamic Golden Age]].\n\n[[Pharmacy in China]] dates at least to the earliest known Chinese manual, the ''Shennong Bencao Jing'' (''The Divine Farmer's Herb-Root Classic''), dating back to the 1st century AD. It was compiled during the [[Han dynasty]] and was attributed to the mythical [[Shennong]]. Earlier literature included lists of prescriptions for specific ailments, exemplified by a manuscript \"Recipes for 52 Ailments\", found in the [[Mawangdui]], sealed in 168 BC.\n\nIn Japan, at the end of the [[Asuka period]] (538\u2013710) and the early [[Nara period]] (710\u2013794), the men who fulfilled roles similar to those of modern pharmacists were highly respected.  The place of pharmacists in society was expressly defined in the [[Taih\u014d Code]] (701) and re-stated in the [[Y\u014dr\u014d Code]] (718).  Ranked positions in the pre-[[Heian period|Heian]] Imperial court were established; and this organizational structure remained largely intact until the [[Meiji Restoration]] (1868).  In this highly stable hierarchy, the pharmacists\u2014and even pharmacist assistants\u2014were assigned status superior to all others in health-related fields such as physicians and acupuncturists. In the Imperial household, the pharmacist was even ranked above the two personal physicians of the Emperor.<ref>Titsingh, Isaac.

[[Muhammad ibn Zakar\u012bya R\u0101zi]] (Rhazes) (865\u2013915), for instance, acted to promote the medical uses of chemical compounds. [[Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi]] (Abulcasis) (936\u20131013) pioneered the preparation of medicines by [[Sublimation (chemistry)|sublimation]] and [[distillation]]. His ''Liber servitoris'' is of particular interest, as it provides the reader with recipes and explains how to prepare the 'simples' from which were [[compounding|compounded]] the complex drugs then generally used. Sabur Ibn Sahl (d 869), was, however, the first physician to initiate pharmacopoedia, describing a large variety of drugs and remedies for ailments. [[Al-Biruni]] (973\u20131050) wrote one of the most valuable Islamic works on pharmacology, entitled ''Kitab al-Saydalah'' (''The Book of Drugs''), in which he detailed the properties of drugs and outlined the role of pharmacy and the functions and duties of the pharmacist. [[Avicenna]], too, described no less than 700 preparations, their properties, modes of action, and their indications. He devoted in fact a whole volume to simple drugs in ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]''. Of great impact were also the works by [[Masawaih al-Mardini|al-Maridini of Baghdad]] and [[Cairo]], and [[Ibn al-Wafid]] (1008\u20131074), both of which were printed in [[Latin]] more than fifty times, appearing as ''De Medicinis universalibus et particularibus'' by '[[Mesue]]' the younger, and the ''Medicamentis simplicibus'' by '[[Abenguefit]]'. [[Peter of Abano]] (1250\u20131316) translated and added a supplement to the work of al-Maridini under the title ''De Veneris''. Al-Muwaffaq's contributions in the field are also pioneering. Living in the 10th century, he wrote ''The foundations of the true properties of Remedies'', amongst others describing [[arsenious oxide]], and being acquainted with [[silicic acid]]. He made clear distinction between [[sodium carbonate]] and [[potassium carbonate]], and drew attention to the poisonous nature of [[copper]] compounds, especially copper [[vitriol]], and also [[lead]] compounds. He also describes the [[Distilled water|distillation of sea-water]] for drinking.<ref>Levey M. (1973), \u2018 Early Arabic Pharmacology', E. J.

It is the community pharmacy in which the dichotomy of the profession exists; health professionals who are also retailers.\n\n[[Community pharmacy|Community pharmacies]] usually consist of a retail storefront with a dispensary, where medications are stored and dispensed. According to Sharif Kaf al-Ghazal, the opening of the first drugstores are recorded by [[Islamic medicine|Muslim]] pharmacists in [[Baghdad]] in 754 AD.<ref name=Hadzovic /><ref>Sharif Kaf al-Ghazal, ''Journal of the International Society for the History of Islamic Medicine'', 2004 (3), pp. 3\u20139 [8].</ref>\n\nIn most countries, the dispensary is subject to pharmacy legislation; with requirements for storage conditions, compulsory texts, equipment, etc., specified in legislation. It was once the case that pharmacists stayed within the dispensary compounding/dispensing medications, but there has been an increasing trend towards the use of trained [[pharmacy technician]]s, with the pharmacist spending more time communicating with patients. Pharmacy technicians are now more dependent upon automation to assist them in their new role dealing with patients' prescriptions and patient safety issues.\n\nPharmacies are typically required to have a pharmacist on-duty at all times when they are open. It is also often a requirement for the owner of a pharmacy to be a registered pharmacist, but that is not the case in all jurisdictions, such that many [[retailer]]s (including [[supermarket]]s and [[Discount retail store|mass merchandiser]]s) now include a pharmacy as a department of their store.\n\nLikewise, many pharmacies are now rather grocery store-like in their design. In addition to medicines and prescriptions, many now sell a diverse arrangement of additional items such as [[cosmetics]], [[shampoo]], [[office supplies]], [[confections]], [[snack foods]], [[durable medical equipment]], [[greeting cards]], and provide [[photo processing]] services.\n\nCommunity pharmacies offer a unique added value by building direct relationships with their customers. They are able to provide more personalized, dedicated care to local members of their community and even offer enhanced services such as Medication Therapy Management (MTM), Medication Synchronization, and compounding. With the aid of [[pharmacy management system]]s and different integrated technologies, these smaller pharmacies are able to keep up with their large-scale competition. \n \nIn community pharmacy, [[Medical prescription|prescription]]s, [[medical devices]] and other [[over the counter]] products are dispensed by community pharmacists. Community pharmacists may be confronted with numerous ethical problems in their daily work. Ethical issues may exist while dispensing medications based on prescription and over the counter products.

Some pharmacists in hospital pharmacies may have more complex clinical medication management issues, and pharmacists in community pharmacies often have more complex business and customer relations issues.\n\nBecause of the complexity of medications including specific indications, effectiveness of treatment regimens, safety of medications (i.e., drug interactions) and [[patient compliance]] issues (in the hospital and at home), many pharmacists practicing in hospitals gain more education and training after pharmacy school through a pharmacy practice residency and sometimes followed by another residency in a specific area. Those pharmacists are often referred to as clinical pharmacists and they often specialize in various disciplines of pharmacy.\n\nFor example, there are pharmacists who specialize in hematology/oncology, HIV/AIDS, infectious disease, critical care, [[emergency medicine]], toxicology, nuclear pharmacy, pain management, psychiatry, anti-coagulation clinics, [[Herbalism|herbal medicine]], neurology/epilepsy management, pediatrics, neonatal pharmacists and more.\n\nHospital pharmacies can often be found within the premises of the hospital. Hospital pharmacies usually stock a larger range of medications, including more specialized medications, than would be feasible in the community setting. Most hospital medications are unit-dose, or a single dose of medicine.  Hospital pharmacists and trained pharmacy technicians compound sterile products for patients including [[total parenteral nutrition]] (TPN), and other medications are given intravenously. That is a complex process that requires adequate training of personnel, [[Quality Assurance|quality assurance]] of products, and adequate facilities.\n\nSeveral hospital pharmacies have decided to [[outsource]] high-risk preparations and some other compounding functions to companies who specialize in compounding. The high cost of medications and drug-related technology and the potential impact of medications and pharmacy services on patient-care outcomes and patient safety require hospital pharmacies to perform at the highest level possible.\n\n===Clinical pharmacy===\n{{Main|Clinical pharmacy}}\n[[Pharmacists]] provide direct patient care services that optimize the use of medication and promotes health, wellness, and disease prevention.<ref>American College of Clinical Pharmacy.

They often participate in patient care rounds for drug product selection.\n\nThe clinical pharmacist's role involves creating a comprehensive drug therapy plan for patient-specific problems, identifying goals of therapy, and reviewing all prescribed medications prior to dispensing and administration to the patient. The review process often involves an evaluation of the appropriateness of drug therapy (e.g., drug choice, dose, route, frequency, and duration of therapy) and its efficacy. The pharmacist must also monitor for potential drug interactions, adverse drug reactions, and assess patient drug allergies while they design and initiate a drug therapy plan.<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Burke JM, Miller WA, Spencer AP, etal | year = 2008 | title = Clinical pharmacist competencies | url = http://www.accp.com/docs/positions/whitePapers/CliniPharmCompTFfinalDraft.pdf | journal = Pharmacotherapy | volume = 28 | issue = 6| pages = 806\u2013815 | doi=10.1592/phco.28.6.806| pmid = 18503407 }}</ref>\n\n===Ambulatory care pharmacy===\nSince the emergence of modern clinical pharmacy, ambulatory care pharmacy practice has emerged as a unique pharmacy practice setting. Ambulatory care pharmacy is based primarily on pharmacotherapy services that a pharmacist provides in a clinic. Pharmacists in this setting often do not dispense drugs, but rather see patients in-office visits to manage chronic disease states.\n\nIn the U.S. federal health care system (including the VA, the Indian Health Service, and NIH) ambulatory care pharmacists are given full independent prescribing authority. In some states such [[North Carolina]] and [[New Mexico]] these pharmacist clinicians are given collaborative prescriptive and diagnostic authority.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 15719585 | year = 2005 | last1 = Knapp | first1 = KK | last2 = Okamoto | first2 = MP | last3 = Black | first3 = BL | title = ASHP survey of ambulatory care pharmacy practice in health systems\u20142004 | volume = 62 | issue = 3 | pages = 274\u201384 | journal = American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy | doi=10.1093/ajhp/62.3.274}}</ref> In 2011 the board of Pharmaceutical Specialties approved ambulatory care pharmacy practice as a separate board certification.

This may include altering the strength, ingredients, or dosage form.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Research|first=Center for Drug Evaluation and|date=2018-11-03|title=Compounding and the FDA: Questions and Answers|url=https://www.fda.gov/drugs/human-drug-compounding/compounding-and-fda-questions-and-answers|journal=FDA|language=en}}</ref> Compounding is a way to create custom drugs for patients who may not be able to take the medication in its standard form, such as due to an allergy or difficulty swallowing. Compounding is necessary for these patients to still be able to properly get the prescriptions they need.\n\nOne area of compounding is preparing drugs in new dosage forms. For example, if a drug manufacturer only provides a drug as a tablet, a compounding pharmacist might make a medicated [[lollipop]] that contains the drug. Patients who have difficulty swallowing the tablet may prefer to suck the medicated lollipop instead.\n\nAnother form of compounding is by mixing different strengths (g, mg, mcg) of capsules or tablets to yield the desired amount of medication indicated by the [[physician]], [[physician assistant]], [[Nurse Practitioner]], or [[clinical pharmacist practitioner]]. This form of compounding is found at community or hospital pharmacies or in-home administration therapy.\n\nCompounding pharmacies specialize in compounding, although many also dispense the same non-compounded drugs that patients can obtain from community pharmacies.\n\n===Consultant pharmacy===\n{{Main|Consultant pharmacist}}\n{{Globalize|section|date=December 2019}}\nConsultant pharmacy practice focuses more on medication regimen review (i.e. \"cognitive services\") than on actual dispensing of drugs. Consultant pharmacists most typically work in [[nursing home]]s, but are increasingly branching into other institutions and non-institutional settings.<ref>American Society of Consultant Pharmacists, [http://www.ascp.com/about/ascpfactsheet.cfm Frequently Asked Questions]</ref> Traditionally{{where|date=December 2019}} consultant pharmacists were usually independent business owners, though in the United States many now work for a large pharmacy management company such as [[Omnicare]], [[Kindred Healthcare]] or [[PharMerica]]. This trend may be gradually reversing{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} as consultant pharmacists begin to work directly with patients, primarily because many elderly people are now taking numerous medications but continue to live outside of institutional settings. Some community pharmacies employ consultant pharmacists and/or provide consulting services.\n\nThe main principle of consultant pharmacy is developed by Hepler and Strand in 1990.<ref name=\"Pharmaceutical care and patient outcomes\">{{Cite journal|author=Strand LM |title=Pharmaceutical care and patient outcomes: notes on what it is we manage |journal=Top Hosp Pharm Manage. |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=77\u201384 |year=1990 |pmid=10128568 }}</ref><ref name=\"Responsibilities in pharmaceutical care\">{{Cite journal|vauthors=Hepler CD, Strand LM |title=Opportunities and responsibilities in pharmaceutical care |journal=Am J Hosp Pharm |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=533\u201343 |year=1990 |pmid=2316538 }}</ref>\n\n===Internet pharmacy===\n{{Main|Online pharmacy}}\n[[File:Mail order pharmacy dispensers.jpg|right|thumb|Canisters of pills from a mail order pharmacy.]]\nSince about the year 2000, a growing number of [[Internet]] pharmacies have been established worldwide.  Many of these pharmacies are similar to community pharmacies, and in fact, many of them are actually operated by [[Bricks and mortar business|brick-and-mortar]] community pharmacies that serve consumers online and those that walk in their door.  The primary difference is the method by which the medications are requested and received. Some customers consider this to be more convenient and private method rather than traveling to a community drugstore where another customer might overhear about the drugs that they take. Internet pharmacies (also known as online pharmacies) are also recommended to some patients by their physicians if they are home-bound.\n\nWhile most Internet pharmacies sell [[prescription drug]]s and require a valid prescription, some Internet pharmacies sell prescription drugs without requiring a prescription.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}  Some customers order drugs from such pharmacies to avoid the \"inconvenience\" of visiting a doctor, or to obtain medications which their doctors were unwilling to prescribe. However, this practice has been criticized as potentially dangerous, especially by those who feel that only doctors can reliably assess contraindications, risk/benefit ratios, and an individual's overall suitability for use of medication. There also have been reports of such pharmacies dispensing substandard products.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/downloads/ForHealthProfessionals/UCM330640.pdf|title=Protecting Patients from Counterfeit and Other Substandard Drugs/Supply Chain Threats}}</ref>\n\nOf particular concern with Internet pharmacies is the ease with which people, youth in particular, can obtain [[controlled substances]] (e.g., [[Vicodin]], generically known as [[hydrocodone]]) via the Internet without a prescription issued by a doctor/practitioner who has an established doctor-patient relationship.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}  There are instances where a practitioner issues a prescription, brokered by an Internet server, for a controlled substance to a \"patient\" s/he has never met.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} In the United States, in order for a prescription for a controlled substance to be valid, it must be issued for a legitimate medical purpose by a licensed practitioner acting in the course of legitimate doctor-patient relationship. The filling pharmacy has a corresponding responsibility to ensure that the prescription is valid. Often, individual state laws outline what defines a valid patient-doctor relationship. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is also heavily involved in monitoring internet pharmacies and has issued warnings against several companies who have violated the U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act that protects individuals against rogue online pharmacies.\n\nCanada is home to dozens of licensed Internet pharmacies, many of which sell their lower-cost prescription drugs to U.S. consumers (who must otherwise pay one of the world's highest drug prices).<ref>London Free Press Regional News Archive, [http://canada.regional-news.org/2005-11-canada-internet-pharmacy-merged-in-38-million-deal.html Canada Internet Pharmacy Merged In $3.8 Million Deal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426022604/http://canada.regional-news.org/2005-11-canada-internet-pharmacy-merged-in-38-million-deal.html |date=26 April 2012 }}</ref> In recent years, many consumers in the US (and in other countries with high drug costs), have turned to licensed Internet pharmacies in India, Israel, and the UK, which often have even lower prices than in Canada.\n\nIn the [[United States]], there has been a push to legalize the importation of medications from [[Canada]] and other countries,{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} in order to reduce consumer costs. While in most cases importation of prescription medications violates [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) regulations and federal laws, enforcement is generally targeted at international drug suppliers, rather than consumers.  There is no known case of any U.S. citizens buying Canadian drugs for personal use with a prescription, who has ever been charged by authorities.\n\n===Veterinary pharmacy===\n{{Main|Veterinary pharmacy}}\nVeterinary pharmacies, sometimes called ''animal pharmacies'', may fall in the category of hospital pharmacy, retail pharmacy or mail-order pharmacy. Veterinary pharmacies stock different varieties and different strengths of medications to fulfill the pharmaceutical needs of animals.  Because the needs of animals, as well as the regulations on [[veterinary medicine]], are often very different from those related to people, in some jurisdictions veterinary pharmacy may be  kept separate from regular pharmacies.\n\n===Nuclear pharmacy===\n{{Main|Nuclear pharmacy}}\nNuclear pharmacy focuses on preparing radioactive materials for diagnostic tests and for treating certain diseases. Nuclear pharmacists undergo additional training specific to handling radioactive materials, and unlike in community and hospital pharmacies, nuclear pharmacists typically do not interact directly with patients.\n\n===Military pharmacy===\n{{Globalize|section|date=December 2019}}\n[[File:332nd EMSG Pharmacy Tech DVIDS328212.jpg|thumb|Airman 1st Class Breanna DeMasters and Staff Sgt.

Importantly, as [[knowledge]] advances, boundaries between these specialty areas of pharmaceutical sciences are beginning to blur. Many fundamental concepts are common to all pharmaceutical sciences. These shared fundamental concepts further the understanding of their applicability to all aspects of [[pharmaceutical research]] and [[drug therapy]].\n\n[[Pharmacocybernetics]] (also known as pharma-cybernetics, cybernetic pharmacy, and cyber pharmacy) is an emerging field that describes the science of supporting drugs and medications use through the application and evaluation of informatics and internet technologies, so as to improve the [[pharmaceutical care]] of patients.<ref name=\"Yap Pharmaco-cybernetics as an interactive component of pharma-culture\">{{cite journal | author = Yap KY, Chuang X, Lee AJM, Lee RZ, Lim L, Lim JJ, Nimesha R | year = 2009 | title = Pharmaco-cybernetics as an interactive component of pharma-culture: empowering drug knowledge through user-, experience- and activity-centered designs | url = | journal = International Journal of Computer Science Issues | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 1\u201313 }}</ref>\n\n==Society and culture==\n\n===Etymology<!--Linked from 'Pharmacology' and 'Pharmakos'-->===\nThe word ''pharmacy'' is derived from [[Old French]] ''farmacie'' \"substance, such as a food or in the form of a medicine which has a laxative effect\" from [[Medieval Latin]] ''pharmacia'' from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''pharmakeia'' ({{lang-grc-gre|\u03c6\u03b1\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03af\u03b1}}) \"a medicine\", which itself derives from ''pharmakon'' ({{lang|grc|\u03c6\u03ac\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd}}), meaning \"drug, [[poison]], [[Spell (paranormal)|spell]]\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/pharmacy|title=pharmacy &#124; Origin and meaning of pharmacy by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com}}</ref><ref>{{LSJ|fa/rmakon|\u03c6\u03ac\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd|ref}}.</ref>{{refn|group=n|Its earliest attested form in Greek could be the [[Mycenaean Greek|Mycenaean]] {{lang|gmy|\ud800\udc1e\ud800\udc14\ud800\udc12}}, ''pa-ma-ko'', written in the [[Linear B]] syllabic script and found on the [[Pylos|PY]] Un 1314 tablet; this tablet is also found listed as PY Vn 1314 or PY Sb 1314.<ref>{{cite web|title=PY 1314 Vn + frr.

In Asian countries, it is traditional for physicians to also provide drugs.\n\nIn contemporary time researchers and health policy analysts have more deeply considered these traditions and their effects. Advocates for separation and advocates for combining make similar claims for each of their conflicting perspectives, saying that separating or combining reduces [[conflict of interest in the healthcare industry]], [[unnecessary health care]], and lowers costs, while the opposite causes those things. Research in various places reports mixed outcomes in different circumstances.\n\n===The future of pharmacy===\n[[File:A U.S. Soldier with the Special Warfare Medical Group(Airborne), speaks to Dr 110228-A-GV060-946.jpg|thumb|Pharmacists now go on rounds with doctors and have more patient interaction.]]\nIn the coming decades, pharmacists are expected to become more integral within the [[health care system]]. Rather than simply dispensing medication, pharmacists are increasingly expected to be compensated for their patient care skills.<ref>American College of Clinical Pharmacy, [http://www.accp.com/position/pos029.pdf Evidence of the Economic Benefit of Clinical Pharmacy Services:  1996\u20132000]</ref> In particular, [[Medication Therapy Management]] (MTM) includes the clinical services that pharmacists can provide for their patients.  Such services include a thorough analysis of all medication ([[prescription medication|prescription]], non-prescription, and herbals) currently being taken by an individual.  The result is a reconciliation of medication and patient education resulting in increased patient health outcomes and decreased costs to the health care system.<ref>American Pharmacy Student Alliance (APSA){{Unreliable source?|date=July 2011}}</ref>\n\nThis shift has already commenced in some countries; for instance, pharmacists in [[Australia]] receive remuneration from the [[Government of Australia|Australian Government]] for conducting comprehensive Home Medicines Reviews. In Canada, pharmacists in certain provinces have limited prescribing rights (as in Alberta and British Columbia) or are remunerated by their provincial government for expanded services such as medications reviews (Medschecks in Ontario). In the United Kingdom, pharmacists who undertake additional training are obtaining prescribing rights and this is because of [[pharmacy education]]. They are also being paid for by the government for [[medicine use review]]s. In Scotland, the pharmacist can write prescriptions for Scottish registered patients of their regular medications, for the majority of drugs, except for controlled drugs, when the patient is unable to see their doctor, as could happen if they are away from home or the doctor is unavailable. In the United States, pharmaceutical care or [[clinical pharmacy]] has had an evolving influence on the practice of pharmacy.<ref name=\"Clinical Pharmacy Defined\">American College of Clinical Pharmacy, [http://www.accp.com/clinical_pharmacy.php Clinical Pharmacy Defined]</ref> Moreover, the [[Doctor of Pharmacy]] (Pharm. D.) degree is now required before entering practice and some pharmacists now complete one or two years of residency or fellowship training following graduation.  In addition, [[consultant pharmacist]]s, who traditionally operated primarily in [[nursing home]]s are now expanding into direct consultation with patients, under the banner of \"senior care pharmacy\".<ref>[[American Society of Consultant Pharmacists]], [http://www.ascp.com/consumers/what/ What is a Senior Care Pharmacist?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061023213917/http://www.ascp.com/consumers/what/ |date=23 October 2006 }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to patient care, pharmacies will be a focal point for medical adherence initiatives.

Featured in ''[[Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones|Episode II: Attack of the Clones]]'' (2002), ''[[Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith|Episode III: Revenge of the Sith]]'' (2005), ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|The Clone Wars]]'' (2008) animated film, the related [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|television series of the same name]]  and the ''[[Star Wars Rebels|Rebels]]'' television series, and they are also featured throughout the comics, novels, and video games of the [[Star Wars expanded universe|''Star Wars Legends'' expanded universe]].\n\nUnder the command of the [[Jedi Order]], clone troopers fight for the [[Galactic Republic]] during the [[Clone Wars (Star Wars)|Clone Wars]], which takes its name from the troopers. At the end of the Wars, they carry out [[Great Jedi Purge|Order 66]] and slaughter the Jedi. After the conversion of the Republic into the Galactic Empire, clone troopers become known as the [[Stormtrooper (Star Wars)|stormtroopers]].\n\nDuring development of ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', Lucas initially conceived of a planet of clones that caused the Clone Wars mentioned in ''[[Star Wars (film)|A New Hope]]''. The clone trooper armor was designed to suggest an evolution into the stormtroopers of the original trilogy, and it incorporated features from both the armor of stormtroopers and [[Boba Fett]], revealed in ''Attack of the Clones'' to be an unaltered clone of Jango. The armored troopers in ''Attack of the Clones'' and ''Revenge of the Sith'' are [[Computer-generated imagery|computer-generated images]] voiced by [[Temuera Morrison]], who played Jango. Younger clones were played by Bodie Taylor and [[Daniel Logan]], who played the younger Boba. Unhelmeted clones were played by both Morrison and Taylor, who wore bodysuits to isolate their heads, and some clone troopers featured a blend of the actors' features. In the animated ''The Clone Wars'' film and television series, adult clone troopers are voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]] and child clone troopers are voiced by Logan.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Concept and creation ==\n[[File:Star Wars Celebration V - 501st room - clone trooper costumes (4940400469).jpg|thumb|300px|Various uniforms of the clone trooper Phase II armour at Star Wars Celebration V - 501st room.]]\n\n=== Development and design ===\nIn writing ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', [[Leigh Brackett]]'s first draft of the film initially developed [[Lando Calrissian]] as a clone from a planet of clones involved in the Clone Wars mentioned in ''[[Star Wars (film)|A New Hope]]'' and were nearly made extinct by the war,{{sfn|Bouzereau|1997|p=196}} but this concept was not featured in the final film. [[George Lucas]] later came up with the alternate concept of an army of clone [[shock troops]] from a remote planet used by the Republic in the war that followed. Lucas intended for the prequel trilogy to depict the evolution of the galaxy's fighting forces, and the clone troopers were the step after flawed [[battle droid]]s.<ref name=\"Archived Clone Troopers\" />\n\nClone troopers were designed to strongly suggest the army's evolution into the Empire's [[Stormtrooper (Star Wars)|stormtrooper]] army. Concept artist Jay Shuster said of the armor design, \"It follows the formula for a lot of the prequel trilogy. Take something pre-conceived in the existing trilogy and de-generate it.\" Design Director [[Doug Chiang]] incorporated both features of the [[Boba Fett]] and stormtrooper armor into the design, acknowledging the \"vague assertion in ''Star Wars'' lore\" that Fett's armor was connected to those of the stormtroopers. Initial concept models implied that the first generation armor was thicker and bulkier than stormtrooper armor, and this characteristic was retained by the art department for ''Revenge of the Sith''. Lucas expressed a desire for individualized trooper armor from the beginning of art development for ''Revenge of the Sith.'' Several variations were largely dictated by environmental needs, but others were influenced of the 2003 ''[[Star Wars: Clone Wars (2003 TV series)|Clone Wars]]'' [[Star Wars: Clone Wars (2003 TV series)|animated series]] and the desert stormtroopers of ''A New Hope''.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Art of Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|last = Rinzler|first = J.W.|publisher = [[LucasBooks]]|year = 2005|isbn = 978-0345431363|location = |page = 198}}</ref> The clone trooper designs \"progressed\" closer toward the stormtrooper designs, and the film included variant designs similar to the sandtrooper, scout trooper, and snowtrooper armor of the original trilogy.<ref name=\"Archived Clone Troopers\" />\n\nThe designs of clone trooper in snow and cold weather gear, seen in season one of ''The Clone Wars'', are heavily inspired by early concept and costume by [[Ralph McQuarrie]], [[Joe Johnston]], and [[John Mollo]] for ''The Empire Strikes Back''.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.starwars.com/tv-shows/clone-wars/trespass-trivia-gallery?dlid=5665dfef83f0c1339285d949|title = Trespass Trivia Gallery|date = |access-date = February 1, 2016|website = StarWars.com|publisher = [[Lucasfilm]]|last = |first = }}</ref>\n\n=== Portrayal ===\nIn ''Attack of the Clones'' and ''Revenge of the Sith'', all clone troopers are [[Computer-generated imagery|computer-generated images]] and are voiced by [[Temuera Morrison]], who played the clone template [[Jango Fett]].<ref name=\"Archived Cody\"/> The child clone troopers were played by [[Daniel Logan]], who also played Jango's clone son [[Boba Fett]], and the clone troopers as young men were played by Bodie Taylor, who was cast for his resemblance to a younger Morrison. Taylor was filmed multiple times and composited to fill out crowded shots set in Tipoca City, and in some cases, such as for distant shots, he was entirely digital.<ref name=\"Archived Clone Troopers\"/>\n\nCommander Cody, seen in armor without his helmet in ''Revenge of the Sith'', was played by Morrison. He wore a blue bodysuit and only footage of his head was used for Cody; he held a [[Stormtrooper (Star Wars)|stormtrooper]] helmet to approximate the digital clone trooper helmet Cody carries.<ref name=\"Archived Cody\" /> Like Morrison, Taylor also played armored and unhelmeted clones in ''Revenge of the Sith'', wearing a blue bodysuit that isolated his head. Some clone troopers were entirely digital and featured a digital blend of Morrison's and Taylor's facial features. The armor was match-animated to the actors' bodies.<ref name=\"Archived Clone Troopers\" />\n\nThe clone troopers are voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]] in the 2008 animated film ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|The Clone Wars]]'' and its related [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|animated television series of the same name]]. Baker attempted to give each clone trooper a unique voice, taking into account personality, age, and position within the unit, sometimes describing the clone in a single adjective and focusing on that descriptor for the voice work. Each clone was voiced individually, with all the clone's lines for the episode recorded at one time before moving to another character, and the dialogue was edited together.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/video/the-clone-wars-season-two-clones|title=The Clone Wars Season 2: Clones|last=|first=|date=|website=StarWars.com|publisher=[[Lucasfilm]]|access-date=June 30, 2016}}</ref>\n\nLogan voiced the young clone troopers in seasons two and three of the 2008 television series. Baker reprises his role in the 2014 ''[[Star Wars Rebels|Rebels]]'' animated series.\n\n==Portrayal in the ''Star Wars'' universe==\n[[File:Clone Trooper (7271127830).jpg|thumb|Commander Cody cosplay. Clone troopers were among the main protagonists in the Clone Wars series.]]\n\n===In the prequel trilogy films===\nIn ''[[Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones|Episode II: Attack of the Clones]]'', Jedi [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] discovers the clone army on [[Kamino (Star Wars)|Kamino]]. He is told that Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas ordered the army on the Republic's behalf ten years prior; however, Sifo-Dyas' apparent death shortly before that timeframe leads the Jedi Order to doubt this. The clone troopers are cloned from Jango Fett, a bounty hunter hired by the mysterious Tyranus, later revealed to be [[Sith]] lord Count Dooku. The clone troopers' genetics are altered so that they age at twice the normal rate and are more loyal and easier to command. The clone army is deployed to Geonosis under the command of the Jedi to rescue Obi-Wan, [[Anakin Skywalker]], and [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]] from execution by the Separatists.<ref name=\"AotC\"/>\n\nIn [[Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith|''Episode III: Revenge of the Sith'']], set three years later, the clone army continues to fight in the [[Clone Wars (Star Wars)|Clone Wars]] against the Separatist [[battle droid]] army. However, Chancellor [[Palpatine]], secretly the Sith lord Darth Sidious, orders the army to execute Order 66, turning all clones against the Jedi. The clone troopers kill their Jedi commanders, and, together with a newly christened [[Darth Vader]] storm the Jedi Temple, burning it and killing the Jedi inside.<ref name=\"RotS\"/>\n\n=== In ''The Clone Wars'' and ''Rebels'' television series ===\nIn the animated TV show ''The Clone Wars'', the Clone Troopers become the focus of some of the episodes to depict them to be more than simple soldiers and with individual personalities. In the final season, more of the nature of \"Order 66\" is revealed when a Clone Trooper named Fives discovers that he and his brothers have chips implanted into their brains that would compel them to kill Jedi when \"Order 66\" is uttered. Ultimately, the Jedi remained unaware of this as Fives was executed by a shock trooper clone ordered by [[Palpatine]] to conceal the existence of the contingency order.\n\nThe animated TV show ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]'' features a group of former Clone troopers that help the crew of the Ghost. It is revealed that in the years after the end of the Clone Wars, the Empire gradually phased out the aging Clone Stormtroopers in favor of birth-born recruits.\n\n=== In other media ===\nClone troopers are referenced in ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens|The Force Awakens]]'' when [[Kylo Ren]] chides [[General Hux]] for the betrayal of rogue stormtrooper [[Finn (Star Wars)|FN-2187]] and suggests that [[Supreme Leader Snoke]] should consider a clone army.<ref name=\"TFA\"/><ref name=\"TFA THR\"/>\n\nIn the novels ''Lords of the Sith'' by [[Paul S. Kemp]], and ''Tarkin'' by [[James Luceno]], several clone troopers are still in active service during the early years of the Empire's reign, such as among stormtroopers serving Darth Vader, and even among the Emperor's elite Imperial Guard.\n\nIn the Legends game ''[[Star Wars: Battlefront II (2005 video game)|Star Wars Battlefront II]]'', the surviving clone troopers were fitted with new armour and weapons, and became the Imperial Stormtrooper corps of the Empire. Later, a combination of natural-born humans as well as clones from different donor templates would be incorporated into the Stormtrooper corps.\n\n== Grand Army of the Republic ==\nThe Grand Army of the Republic was the primary centralized military force of the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars. In addition to warships and advanced weaponry, the army consisted of legions of clone troopers\u2014genetically identical soldiers bred to serve the Republic. Although the clone army was originally envisioned by [[Jedi]] Master Sifo-Dyas, who secretly commissioned the Kaminoan cloners to create an army for the Republic, the clones were ultimately repurposed as the secret weapon of the [[Sith]], the ancient enemies of the Jedi Order.\n\n=== Coruscant Guard ===\nThe Coruscant Guard is a division of clone troopers tasked with [[internal security]] and [[peacekeeping]] operations on Coruscant, protecting \"[[soft target]]\" public spaces and important \"hard target\" buildings, and serving as escorts and guards on diplomatic missions.{{sfn|Beecroft|2011|p=172}}<ref name=\"Coruscant Guard Databank\"/> They first appear in ''Episode III: Revenge of the Sith'', where they search for Yoda's body in the Senate building after his duel with Darth Sidious and later help Sidious recover Darth Vader's body on Mustafar.{{sfn|Beecroft|2011|p=172}} The Coruscant Guard appears in ''The Clone Wars'' film and television series, led by Commander Fox.<ref name=\"Coruscant Guard Databank\"/><ref name=\"TCW Film\"/> They hunt Jedi fugitive Ahsoka Tano when she is framed for the bombing of the Jedi Temple and for murder in season five, and they search for ARC trooper Fives when he is framed for an assassination attempt on Supreme Chancellor Palpatine in season six. Members of the Coruscant Guard wear armor with red markings.{{sfn|Beecroft|2011|p=172}}\n\n====Commander Fox====\nCommander Fox, CC-1010, led the Coruscant Guard, an elite clone trooper unit assigned to serve as peace-keepers on the Galactic Republic capital. Following the Battle on Teth, Fox's squad rescued Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala from Ziro the Hutt. Fox stormed Ziro's Palace, took out his battle droids, and freed Amidala. Ziro was taken to the Republic Judiciary Central Detention Center. When Cad Bane entered the Senate building and held a number of Senators and the Supreme Chancellor hostage, Fox led a company of the Coruscant Guard to cut off his escape. Unfortunately, Bane had rigged the chamber and the hostages with explosives. Seeing this, Fox ordered his men to stand down and allowed the bounty hunter and his team to leave the Senate building\n\nLike every other clone trooper in the Guard, Fox was bound by honor and duty to protect and serve the Supreme Chancellor and the members of the Galactic Senate. Utterly fearless, he was always the first to lead the charge into battle, even in the most perilous combat situations. His unquestionable loyalty meant he would carry out his orders without question, even if it meant killing a Jedi or another \"brother\". His exemplary performance has made him one of the most highly decorated soldiers in the Republic army. Additional sources state that Fox continued his duty on Coruscant, until an error on his part led Darth Vader to execute him. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/clone-commander-fox |title=Clone Commander Fox |publisher=StarWars.com |date=2014-06-16 |accessdate=2016-12-20}}</ref>\n\n====Commander Thire====\nCommander Thire, CC-4477, a Coruscant Guard clone shock trooper who served as a lieutenant in the Coruscant Guard of the Grand Army of the Republic. During the Clone Wars, he accompanied Grand Master Yoda of the Jedi Order on an diplomatic assignment to meet with King Katuunko of Toydaria. In the course of their mission Yoda inspired his clone troopers to take strength from their individual traits, such as Thire's patience.\n\nFollowing the initiation of Order 66 and the subsequent confrontation between Yoda and Emperor Palpatine in 19 BBY, Thire and his troopers were ordered to hunt the Jedi Master. The failure to locate his body convinced Mas Amedda that Yoda was still alive, leading the Emperor to order Thire to resume the search. However, Yoda succeeded in escaping from Coruscant with the aid of Senator Bail Organa. Thire later accompanied Palpatine to Mustafar to recover the critically wounded Darth Vader.\n\n=== 501st Legion ===\nThe 501st Legion is a division of clone troopers under the command of Jedi General Anakin Skywalker and Padawan Commander [[Ahsoka Tano]]. It first appears unnamed in ''Revenge of the Sith'' under the leadership of Commander Appo, and they assault the Jedi Temple on Coruscant under Order 66. The 501st Legion also appears extensively throughout ''Star Wars Battlefront'' video game franchise and ''The Clone Wars'' television series, under the leadership of Captain Rex of Torrent Company. In the ''Star Wars Legends'' expanded universe, after the conversion of the Republic into the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]], the 501st Legion (nicknamed \"Vader's Fist\") is placed under the command of [[General Maximilian Veers]] that serves as [[Darth Vader]]'s personal battalion. Members of the 501st Legion wear armor with blue markings. The unit is named after the [[501st Legion]] costuming group.\n\nDuring ''[[Star Wars Celebration]]'' 2016, Dave Filoni stated that in a planned story arc for ''The Clone Wars'', Ahsoka, who has left the Jedi Order, is given command of part of the 501st Legion, including Captain Rex; those under her command repaint their helmets orange and adorn them with Ahsoka's togruta markings. She leads them at the siege of Mandalore, which takes place at the same time as the beginning of [[Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith|''Revenge of the Sith'']].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/the-untold-stories-of-ahsoka-tano-broke-our-hearts-and-1783725803|title=The Untold Stories of Ahsoka Tano Broke Our Hearts\u2014And Ahsoka's, Too|last=Whitbrook|first=James|date=July 15, 2016|website=|publisher=[[io9]]|access-date=July 15, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==== Commander Appo ====\nCommander Appo, CC-1119, served in the 501st Legion under the command of Jedi General Anakin Skywalker. He first appears in ''Episode III: Revenge of the Sith'', in which he and other members of the 501st carry out Order 66 and follow Anakin, now Darth Vader, in attacking the Jedi Temple on Coruscant.<ref name=\"Appo\" /> He stops Senator [[Bail Organa]] from entering the Temple.<ref name=\"RotS\" /> Appo later appears in season four of ''The Clone Wars'' television series as a sergeant in the 501st serving under clone Captain Rex. His armor bears blue markings. In ''The Clone Wars'' television series, his helmet is adorned with a white arrow in reference to [[Appa (character)|Appa]] of the ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]'' television series, on which ''The Clone Wars'' supervising director [[Dave Filoni]] worked.<ref name=\"Appo Trivia\" />\n\n==== Captain Rex ====\n{{main|Captain Rex}}\nCaptain Rex, CT-7567, leads Torrent Company of the 501st Legion, often under the command of Jedi General [[Anakin Skywalker]] and Jedi Commander [[Ahsoka Tano]].<ref name=\"Rex Databank\">{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/clone-captain-rex|title=Clone Captain Rex|last=|first=|date=|website=StarWars.com|publisher=[[Lucasfilm]]|access-date=January 14, 2016}}</ref> He first appears in ''The Clone Wars'' film and its related television series, and he is the primary clone trooper character of the series. Rex later appears in the [[Star Wars Rebels|''Rebels'' television series]], set fourteen years after ''Revenge of the Sith''. Now a much older man because of his accelerated aging, he lives on the wasteland planet Seelos and hunted worm-like joopa with Wolffe and Gregor before they are offered a place in the [[Rebel Alliance]].\n\n==== ARC Trooper Fives ====\nARC trooper Fives, CT-27-5555, serves alongside fellow ARC trooper Echo.<ref name=\"Fives Databank\">{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/arc-trooper-fives|title=ARC Trooper Fives|last=|first=|date=|website=StarWars.com|publisher=[[Lucasfilm]]|access-date=January 14, 2015}}</ref> He first appears in ''The Clone Wars'' season one episode \"Rookies\" as a regular trooper. He and his unit are assigned to a remote listening outpost that is invaded by Separatist droids. Though the invasion is successfully repelled, only Fives and Echo survive, and they are reassigned to the 501st Legion.<ref name=\"Rookies\" /> The season three episode \"Clone Cadets\" depicts Fives and his unit as cadets in training on [[Kamino (Star Wars)|Kamino]]. The unit, called Domino squad, is initially unable to work together to pass their final test. Fives and Echo feel weighed down by the others in the squad and ask to be reassigned, but the request is denied. Under the advice of Jedi General Shaak Ti, Fives and Echo recommit themselves to Domino, and the squad is able to pass. Fives and Echo are eventually promoted to ARC troopers together for their actions while defending Kamino and continue serving with the 501st. When assigned to the command of Jedi General Pong Krell, Fives finds Krell's disregard for clone trooper lives appalling and openly disagrees with Krell and with Captain Rex, who is insistent on following orders. Fives disobeys a direct order, and though his actions allow a Republic victory, Krell, without process of a [[court-martial]], finds Fives guilty of [[treason]] and sentences him to [[execution by firing squad]]. However, Fives urges his fellow troopers to see this as an injustice, and the firing squad refuses to execute him.\n\nIn season six, Fives discovers the inhibitor chip conspiracy, removing his own in the process, and attempts to warn the Republic that the clone trooper army can be used against the Jedi. However, Palpatine frames Fives for an assassination attempt, initiating a manhunt for Fives. Fives is able to contact Rex and Anakin Skywalker, and he attempts to warn them of the conspiracy and of Palpatine's involvement. He is ultimately killed by Commander Fox of the Coruscant Guard and dies in Rex's arms.\n\nFives' name is derived from his designation number (CT-27-5555), which features fives in sequence.<ref name=\"Rookies\" /> He is distinguished by a [[goatee]] and a stylized numeral five tattoo on his right temple. His armor bears blue markings, and a stylized worm creature adorns his helmets; after his promotion to ARC trooper, he also wears light gray pauldrons on his shoulders and kilt-like kama painted with blue stripes. He regards duty and honor above orders and protocol, feeling that there is no honor in following foolish orders and marching to his death. He insists that clone troopers be referred to by name, not number, and that they are soldiers, not units, and should be treated as such. He is a close friend of Rex and, after the apparent death of Echo, considers his best friend to be fellow trooper Tup, who aids Fives against Krell and is one of the first to refuse executing Fives when given the order by Krell. When Tup begins behaving abnormally, a result of an inhibitor chip malfunction, Fives goes to great lengths and disregards order to attempt to save Tup's life and, later, discover the true cause of Tup's death. With his dying words, he describes attempting to expose the conspiracy to have been his duty.\n\n==== ARC Trooper Echo ====\nARC trooper Echo, CT-21-0408,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/tv-shows/clone-wars/clone-cadets-trivia-gallery?dlid=56735fbcb6f86c976505f8b5|title=Clone Cadets Trivia Gallery|last=|first=|date=|website=StarWars.com|publisher=[[Lucasfilm]]|access-date=January 27, 2016}}</ref> sometimes CT-1409,<ref name=\"Echo Databank\">{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/arc-trooper-echo|title=ARC Trooper Echo|last=|first=|date=|website=StarWars.com|publisher=[[Lucasfilm]]|access-date=January 14, 2015}}</ref> serves alongside fellow ARC trooper Fives. He first appears in ''The Clone Wars'' season one episode \"Rookies\" as a regular trooper. He and his unit are assigned to a remote listening outpost that is invaded by Separatist droids. Though the invasion is successfully repelled, only Echo and Fives survive, and they are reassigned to the 501st Legion.<ref name=\"Rookies\" /> The season three episode \"Clone Cadets\" depicts Echo and his unit as cadets in training on Kamino. The unit, called Domino squad, is initially unable to work together to pass their final test. Echo and Fives feel weighed down by the others in the squad and ask to be reassigned, but the request is denied. Under the advice of Jedi General Shaak Ti, Echo and Fives recommit themselves to Domino, and the squad is able to pass. Echo and Fives are eventually promoted to ARC troopers together for their actions while defending Kamino and continue serving with the 501st. Echo is apparently killed in an explosion during a rescue operation in the season three episode \"Counter Attack\".\n\nStory reels for a previously-unfinished four episode arc called Bad Batch (Initially part of ''The Clone Wars'' Legacy project, the episodes were later released to Disney+ in their completed state) revealed that Echo survived and was captured by the Separatists. He was modified into a [[cyborg]] able to communicate directly to computers and tasked with decoding the Republic strategy [[algorithm]]. Echo is rescued by Captain Rex, and with his ability to understand Separatist transmissions, he plays a key role in a victory against the Separatists.\n\nEcho's armor bears blue markings, and a blue handprint adorns his chest-plate, created when Rex touched it while covered in eel blood during Echo's first mission. After his promotion to ARC trooper, Echo also wears light gray pauldrons on his shoulders and a kilt-like kama painted in an asymmetrical white and blue design. Later, after his rescue from Separatist capture, he is visibly a cyborg, with various apparatus protruding from his head and a droid plug in place of his right hand; post-rescue, he takes to wearing what appears to be a stripped-down variant on Standard Phase II Armor. Throughout his appearances, he is characterized as one who strictly follows orders, regulations, and protocol. Echo's name is given to him by Domino squad on Kamino as a sarcastic reference to his tendency to immediately repeat orders, even if his squad already heard.<ref name=\"Rookies\" />\n\n==== Trooper Kix ====\nKix, CT-6116, is a medic serving in the 501st Legion. In season six, Kix aids Fives, a fugitive because he discovered the inhibitor chip conspiracy. The short story \"The Crimson Corsair and the Lost Treasure of Count Dooku\" reveals that this action prompted Count Dooku to capture Kix, who discovered the conspiracy himself by the time of his capture. With droids failing to secure a confession, Kix was frozen in stasis for delivery to Dooku. The ship crashed into a planet during a randomized hyperspace jump to escape a Republic attack and protect \"Dooku's prize\". Fifty years later, Kix is released from stasis by pirates searching for \"the lost treasure of Count Dooku\". Kix is taken aboard the Corsair's ship and welcomed to their endeavor of raiding forgotten Separatist bases.<ref name=\"Corsair\" />\n\nKix is distinguished by his shaved hair and a phrase translating to \"a good droid is a dead one\" tattooed across his head. His armor bears blue markings, and his Phase II armor bears a red insignia marking him as a medic. He is \"dedicated to preserving the life of his brothers\", and he even tells an injured Captain Rex, \"As the team medic, when it comes to the health of the men, including you, I outrank everyone.\" However, he still has \"no qualms about fighting the enemy\".\n\n==== ARC Trooper Jesse ====\nJesse, CT-5597, is a member in the 501st Legion. In season four, Jesse, like Fives comes to consider General Pong Krell to be ruthless and reckless (mainly over the casualty numbers). He later helps Fives and Hardcase on a rogue mission to destroy a Separatist supply ship, which succeeds at the cost of Hardcase's life.\n\nJesse is distinguished by his shaved hair with the Republic symbol tattooed on most of his head. His armor bears blue markings with the Republic symbol on the center.\n\n==== Trooper Tup ====\nTup, CT-5385, was part of the 501st legion under Captain Rex. He served in the Umbara campaign and was key to the capture of treasonous Jedi General Pong Krell, supporting and siding with his friend Fives even after Fives had been condemned to death by Krell and stunning the Jedi after a fierce battle with mutinous 501st clones led by Rex. In the sixth season, Tup suffered a malfunction in a biotechnical chip implanted in his brain shortly after his creation by the Kaminoans. Intended to ensure that the clones obeyed [[Order 66 (Star Wars)|Order 66]], the chip caused Tup to shoot and kill Jedi General Tiplar despite not having been ordered to. As Tup was being shipped back to Kamino for evaluation, he was kidnapped by the Separatists (who wanted to know why his chip had malfunctioned), only to be recovered shortly afterwards. Tup's actions led to the discovery of the chips by both the Jedi and the clones themselves, but Tup died of medical complications soon afterwards. Though Fives attempted to avenge Tup's death by finding the truth behind the chips, he was killed before he could reveal what he had learned, with Tup's actions and death officially declared to be the result of a locally acquired virus.\n\nTup's armor featured the blue markings common in the 501st, as well as an image of a single blue teardrop underneath the right eye of his helmet; this matched a tattoo on his face.\n\n===Special operations forces ===\nWithin the film series and in the [[Star Wars expanded universe|''Star Wars'' expanded universe]] media, a number of specialized trooper units are seen, including elite Republic [[special forces]] soldiers such as the 'Advanced Reconnaissance Commandos' (ARC troopers), and Null ARCs,<ref>\"Republic Commando: Triple Zero\"</ref> who usually work alone. All clone commandos and ARCs were trained by Mandalorian mercenaries; the elite Clone Troopers are known as Shadow Troopers.\n\nThe style and color of a clone troopers armor often varies depending on their rank, specialization, unit, or environment, for example, the clone troopers on Kashyyyk wear camouflage green scout-style armour whereas the 501st legion wears standard white armor with blue accents. Another example is the aquatic ''[[Scuba diving|SCUBA]]'' troopers, who appear in the animated series ''[[Star Wars: Clone Wars (TV series)|Star Wars: Clone Wars]]''. SCUBA troopers are equipped with high-tech breathing apparatuses and long range blaster rifles.<ref>{{cite book|title=Hard Contact|publisher=Del Rey Books|year=2004|isbn=0-345-47827-4|author=Traviss, Karen}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Triple Zero|publisher=Del Rey Books|year=2006|isbn=0-345-49009-6|author=Traviss, Karen}}</ref>\n\n====Clone Force 99====\n{{section-stub|date=February 2020}}\nClone Force 99\u2014informally known as \"The Bad Batch\"\u2014was a clone commando squad consisted of four clone troopers with personality querks that only slightly resemble normal clones\u2014the result of specially designed genetic experimentation.

Fi suffers a brain injury in ''True Colors'' and is declared legally dead when he falls into a coma; medical procedure requires he be [[Euthanasia|euthanized]], but he is taken to [[Mandalore]] where he eventually makes a full recovery. Atin, RC-3222, is the squad's technical expert, and he is described as quiet but deeply stubborn. Atin was trained by Walon Vau, unlike the others, and he initially harbors deep resentments for Vau. Corr, CT-5108/8843 later RC-5108/8843, joins the squad upon Fi's injury. Corr is a regular trooper who served as a bomb disposal expert; because of an injury, both arms from the elbows are prosthetic.\n\n==== Captain Gregor ====\nCaptain Gregor, CC-5576-39, is a former [[commando]] suffering [[amnesia]] and living on the distant planet Abafar. He is introduced in the season five episode \"Missing in Action\", where a stranded Republic mission discovers him working as a dishwasher in a diner. It is revealed that he lost his memories and sense of identity after a shuttle crash during a devastating battle. He was rescued by his employer, who keeps Gregor's true identity from him to prevent him from leaving, but Gregor is able to regain his sense of duty and his armor to help the Republic. Gregor holds off Separatist droids to allow the Republic mission to escape, and despite his promise to make his way home, he is seemingly killed in an explosion.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Missing in Action|series=Star Wars: The Clone Wars|series-link=Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|first1=Steward (Director)|last1=Lee|first2=Brent (Writer)|last2=Friedman|date=January 5, 2013|season=5|number=12}}</ref> He later appears in the ''Rebels'' television series, set fourteen years after ''Revenge of the Sith''.

Noting that the films never specify that the clone troopers are replaced by regular soldiers by the original trilogy, he believed that the idea of soldiers who are created solely for war and are little more than machines \"sanitizes the war of the franchise's title\". He praised the decision of ''The Force Awakens'' to explicitly move away from clone troopers as bringing \"much-needed moral complexity\" to the film's conflict.<ref name=\"TFA THR\" />\n\n==See also==\n*[[Stormtrooper (Star Wars)|Stormtrooper (''Star Wars'')]]\n*[[501st Legion]]\n*[[Captain Rex]]\n\n==References==\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Appo\">{{cite web|url = http://www.starwars.com/databank/appo|title = Appo |date = |access-date = January 30, 2016|website = StarWars.com|publisher = [[Lucasfilm]]|last = |first = }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Appo Trivia\">{{cite web|url = http://www.starwars.com/tv-shows/clone-wars/the-general-trivia?dlid=5390fdbf0a172d315d0007c8|title = The General Trivia Gallery|date = |access-date = January 22, 2016|website = StarWars.com|publisher = [[Lucasfilm]]|last = |first = }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Archived Clone Troopers\">{{cite web|url = http://www.starwars.com/databank/organization/clonetroopers/index.html|title = Clone Troopers|date = |access-date = January 14, 2016|website = StarWars.com|publisher = [[Lucasfilm]]|last = |first = |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110724063805/http://www.starwars.com/databank/organization/clonetroopers/index.html|archive-date = July 24, 2011}}</ref> \n<ref name=\"Archived Cody\">{{cite web|url = http://www.starwars.com/databank/character/commandercody/index.html|title = Cody, Clone Commander|date = |access-date = January 14, 2016|website = StarWars.com|publisher = [[Lucasfilm]]|last = |first = |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110721000947/http://www.starwars.com/databank/character/commandercody/index.html|archive-date = July 21, 2011}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Bly Databank\">{{cite web|url = http://www.starwars.com/databank/clone-commander-bly|title = Clone Commander Bly|date = |access-date = January 14, 2016|website = StarWars.com|publisher = [[Lucasfilm]]|last = |first = }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Cody Databank\">{{cite web|url = http://www.starwars.com/databank/clone-commander-cody|title = Clone Commander Cody|date = |access-date = January 14, 2016|website = StarWars.com|publisher = [[Lucasfilm]]|last = |first = }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Coruscant Guard Databank\">{{cite web|url = http://www.starwars.com/databank/coruscant-guard|title = Coruscant Guard|date = |access-date = February 10, 2016|website = StarWars.com|publisher = [[Lucasfilm]]|last = |first = }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Gree Databank\">{{cite web|url = http://www.starwars.com/databank/clone-commander-gree|title = Clone Commander Gree|date = |access-date = January 14, 2016|website = StarWars.com|publisher = [[Lucasfilm]]|last = |first = }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"TFA THR\">{{cite web|url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/one-small-change-force-awakens-850277|title = One Small Change in 'Force Awakens' That Complicates the 'Star Wars' Series (Spoilers)|date = December 20, 2015|access-date = January 17, 2016|website = |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|last = McMillan|first = Graeme}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"AotC\">{{cite AV media |people= Lucas, George (Director)|year= 2002|title= [[Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones]]|medium= Motion picture}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"RotS\">{{cite AV media |people= Lucas, George (Director)|year= 2005|title= [[Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith]]|medium= Motion picture}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Rookies\">{{Cite episode |title= Rookies|series= Star Wars: The Clone Wars|series-link= Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|first1= Justin (Director)|last1= Ridge|first2=Steven (Writer)|last2=Melching|date= October 24, 2008|season= 1|number=5 }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"TCW Film\">{{cite AV media |people= Filoni, Dave (Director)|year= 2008|title= [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]|medium= Motion picture}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"TFA\">{{cite AV media |people= [[J.

At the end of the Wars, they carry out [[Great Jedi Purge|Order 66]] and slaughter the Jedi. After the conversion of the Republic into the Galactic Empire, clone troopers become known as the [[Stormtrooper (Star Wars)|stormtroopers]].\n\nDuring development of ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', Lucas initially conceived of a planet of clones that caused the Clone Wars mentioned in ''[[Star Wars (film)|A New Hope]]''. The clone trooper armor was designed to suggest an evolution into the stormtroopers of the original trilogy, and it incorporated features from both the armor of stormtroopers and [[Boba Fett]], revealed in ''Attack of the Clones'' to be an unaltered clone of Jango. The armored troopers in ''Attack of the Clones'' and ''Revenge of the Sith'' are [[Computer-generated imagery|computer-generated images]] voiced by [[Temuera Morrison]], who played Jango. Younger clones were played by Bodie Taylor and [[Daniel Logan]], who played the younger Boba. Unhelmeted clones were played by both Morrison and Taylor, who wore bodysuits to isolate their heads, and some clone troopers featured a blend of the actors' features. In the animated ''The Clone Wars'' film and television series, adult clone troopers are voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]] and child clone troopers are voiced by Logan.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Concept and creation ==\n[[File:Star Wars Celebration V - 501st room - clone trooper costumes (4940400469).jpg|thumb|300px|Various uniforms of the clone trooper Phase II armour at Star Wars Celebration V - 501st room.]]\n\n=== Development and design ===\nIn writing ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', [[Leigh Brackett]]'s first draft of the film initially developed [[Lando Calrissian]] as a clone from a planet of clones involved in the Clone Wars mentioned in ''[[Star Wars (film)|A New Hope]]'' and were nearly made extinct by the war,{{sfn|Bouzereau|1997|p=196}} but this concept was not featured in the final film. [[George Lucas]] later came up with the alternate concept of an army of clone [[shock troops]] from a remote planet used by the Republic in the war that followed. Lucas intended for the prequel trilogy to depict the evolution of the galaxy's fighting forces, and the clone troopers were the step after flawed [[battle droid]]s.<ref name=\"Archived Clone Troopers\" />\n\nClone troopers were designed to strongly suggest the army's evolution into the Empire's [[Stormtrooper (Star Wars)|stormtrooper]] army. Concept artist Jay Shuster said of the armor design, \"It follows the formula for a lot of the prequel trilogy. Take something pre-conceived in the existing trilogy and de-generate it.\" Design Director [[Doug Chiang]] incorporated both features of the [[Boba Fett]] and stormtrooper armor into the design, acknowledging the \"vague assertion in ''Star Wars'' lore\" that Fett's armor was connected to those of the stormtroopers. Initial concept models implied that the first generation armor was thicker and bulkier than stormtrooper armor, and this characteristic was retained by the art department for ''Revenge of the Sith''. Lucas expressed a desire for individualized trooper armor from the beginning of art development for ''Revenge of the Sith.'' Several variations were largely dictated by environmental needs, but others were influenced of the 2003 ''[[Star Wars: Clone Wars (2003 TV series)|Clone Wars]]'' [[Star Wars: Clone Wars (2003 TV series)|animated series]] and the desert stormtroopers of ''A New Hope''.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Art of Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|last = Rinzler|first = J.W.|publisher = [[LucasBooks]]|year = 2005|isbn = 978-0345431363|location = |page = 198}}</ref> The clone trooper designs \"progressed\" closer toward the stormtrooper designs, and the film included variant designs similar to the sandtrooper, scout trooper, and snowtrooper armor of the original trilogy.<ref name=\"Archived Clone Troopers\" />\n\nThe designs of clone trooper in snow and cold weather gear, seen in season one of ''The Clone Wars'', are heavily inspired by early concept and costume by [[Ralph McQuarrie]], [[Joe Johnston]], and [[John Mollo]] for ''The Empire Strikes Back''.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.starwars.com/tv-shows/clone-wars/trespass-trivia-gallery?dlid=5665dfef83f0c1339285d949|title = Trespass Trivia Gallery|date = |access-date = February 1, 2016|website = StarWars.com|publisher = [[Lucasfilm]]|last = |first = }}</ref>\n\n=== Portrayal ===\nIn ''Attack of the Clones'' and ''Revenge of the Sith'', all clone troopers are [[Computer-generated imagery|computer-generated images]] and are voiced by [[Temuera Morrison]], who played the clone template [[Jango Fett]].<ref name=\"Archived Cody\"/> The child clone troopers were played by [[Daniel Logan]], who also played Jango's clone son [[Boba Fett]], and the clone troopers as young men were played by Bodie Taylor, who was cast for his resemblance to a younger Morrison. Taylor was filmed multiple times and composited to fill out crowded shots set in Tipoca City, and in some cases, such as for distant shots, he was entirely digital.<ref name=\"Archived Clone Troopers\"/>\n\nCommander Cody, seen in armor without his helmet in ''Revenge of the Sith'', was played by Morrison. He wore a blue bodysuit and only footage of his head was used for Cody; he held a [[Stormtrooper (Star Wars)|stormtrooper]] helmet to approximate the digital clone trooper helmet Cody carries.<ref name=\"Archived Cody\" /> Like Morrison, Taylor also played armored and unhelmeted clones in ''Revenge of the Sith'', wearing a blue bodysuit that isolated his head. Some clone troopers were entirely digital and featured a digital blend of Morrison's and Taylor's facial features.

Baker attempted to give each clone trooper a unique voice, taking into account personality, age, and position within the unit, sometimes describing the clone in a single adjective and focusing on that descriptor for the voice work.

Clone troopers were among the main protagonists in the Clone Wars series.]]\n\n===In the prequel trilogy films===\nIn ''[[Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones|Episode II: Attack of the Clones]]'', Jedi [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] discovers the clone army on [[Kamino (Star Wars)|Kamino]]. He is told that Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas ordered the army on the Republic's behalf ten years prior; however, Sifo-Dyas' apparent death shortly before that timeframe leads the Jedi Order to doubt this. The clone troopers are cloned from Jango Fett, a bounty hunter hired by the mysterious Tyranus, later revealed to be [[Sith]] lord Count Dooku. The clone troopers' genetics are altered so that they age at twice the normal rate and are more loyal and easier to command. The clone army is deployed to Geonosis under the command of the Jedi to rescue Obi-Wan, [[Anakin Skywalker]], and [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]] from execution by the Separatists.<ref name=\"AotC\"/>\n\nIn [[Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith|''Episode III: Revenge of the Sith'']], set three years later, the clone army continues to fight in the [[Clone Wars (Star Wars)|Clone Wars]] against the Separatist [[battle droid]] army. However, Chancellor [[Palpatine]], secretly the Sith lord Darth Sidious, orders the army to execute Order 66, turning all clones against the Jedi. The clone troopers kill their Jedi commanders, and, together with a newly christened [[Darth Vader]] storm the Jedi Temple, burning it and killing the Jedi inside.<ref name=\"RotS\"/>\n\n=== In ''The Clone Wars'' and ''Rebels'' television series ===\nIn the animated TV show ''The Clone Wars'', the Clone Troopers become the focus of some of the episodes to depict them to be more than simple soldiers and with individual personalities. In the final season, more of the nature of \"Order 66\" is revealed when a Clone Trooper named Fives discovers that he and his brothers have chips implanted into their brains that would compel them to kill Jedi when \"Order 66\" is uttered. Ultimately, the Jedi remained unaware of this as Fives was executed by a shock trooper clone ordered by [[Palpatine]] to conceal the existence of the contingency order.\n\nThe animated TV show ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]'' features a group of former Clone troopers that help the crew of the Ghost. It is revealed that in the years after the end of the Clone Wars, the Empire gradually phased out the aging Clone Stormtroopers in favor of birth-born recruits.\n\n=== In other media ===\nClone troopers are referenced in ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens|The Force Awakens]]'' when [[Kylo Ren]] chides [[General Hux]] for the betrayal of rogue stormtrooper [[Finn (Star Wars)|FN-2187]] and suggests that [[Supreme Leader Snoke]] should consider a clone army.<ref name=\"TFA\"/><ref name=\"TFA THR\"/>\n\nIn the novels ''Lords of the Sith'' by [[Paul S. Kemp]], and ''Tarkin'' by [[James Luceno]], several clone troopers are still in active service during the early years of the Empire's reign, such as among stormtroopers serving Darth Vader, and even among the Emperor's elite Imperial Guard.\n\nIn the Legends game ''[[Star Wars: Battlefront II (2005 video game)|Star Wars Battlefront II]]'', the surviving clone troopers were fitted with new armour and weapons, and became the Imperial Stormtrooper corps of the Empire. Later, a combination of natural-born humans as well as clones from different donor templates would be incorporated into the Stormtrooper corps.\n\n== Grand Army of the Republic ==\nThe Grand Army of the Republic was the primary centralized military force of the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars. In addition to warships and advanced weaponry, the army consisted of legions of clone troopers\u2014genetically identical soldiers bred to serve the Republic. Although the clone army was originally envisioned by [[Jedi]] Master Sifo-Dyas, who secretly commissioned the Kaminoan cloners to create an army for the Republic, the clones were ultimately repurposed as the secret weapon of the [[Sith]], the ancient enemies of the Jedi Order.\n\n=== Coruscant Guard ===\nThe Coruscant Guard is a division of clone troopers tasked with [[internal security]] and [[peacekeeping]] operations on Coruscant, protecting \"[[soft target]]\" public spaces and important \"hard target\" buildings, and serving as escorts and guards on diplomatic missions.{{sfn|Beecroft|2011|p=172}}<ref name=\"Coruscant Guard Databank\"/> They first appear in ''Episode III: Revenge of the Sith'', where they search for Yoda's body in the Senate building after his duel with Darth Sidious and later help Sidious recover Darth Vader's body on Mustafar.{{sfn|Beecroft|2011|p=172}} The Coruscant Guard appears in ''The Clone Wars'' film and television series, led by Commander Fox.<ref name=\"Coruscant Guard Databank\"/><ref name=\"TCW Film\"/> They hunt Jedi fugitive Ahsoka Tano when she is framed for the bombing of the Jedi Temple and for murder in season five, and they search for ARC trooper Fives when he is framed for an assassination attempt on Supreme Chancellor Palpatine in season six.

Following the Battle on Teth, Fox's squad rescued Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala from Ziro the Hutt. Fox stormed Ziro's Palace, took out his battle droids, and freed Amidala. Ziro was taken to the Republic Judiciary Central Detention Center. When Cad Bane entered the Senate building and held a number of Senators and the Supreme Chancellor hostage, Fox led a company of the Coruscant Guard to cut off his escape. Unfortunately, Bane had rigged the chamber and the hostages with explosives. Seeing this, Fox ordered his men to stand down and allowed the bounty hunter and his team to leave the Senate building\n\nLike every other clone trooper in the Guard, Fox was bound by honor and duty to protect and serve the Supreme Chancellor and the members of the Galactic Senate. Utterly fearless, he was always the first to lead the charge into battle, even in the most perilous combat situations. His unquestionable loyalty meant he would carry out his orders without question, even if it meant killing a Jedi or another \"brother\". His exemplary performance has made him one of the most highly decorated soldiers in the Republic army. Additional sources state that Fox continued his duty on Coruscant, until an error on his part led Darth Vader to execute him. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/clone-commander-fox |title=Clone Commander Fox |publisher=StarWars.com |date=2014-06-16 |accessdate=2016-12-20}}</ref>\n\n====Commander Thire====\nCommander Thire, CC-4477, a Coruscant Guard clone shock trooper who served as a lieutenant in the Coruscant Guard of the Grand Army of the Republic. During the Clone Wars, he accompanied Grand Master Yoda of the Jedi Order on an diplomatic assignment to meet with King Katuunko of Toydaria. In the course of their mission Yoda inspired his clone troopers to take strength from their individual traits, such as Thire's patience.\n\nFollowing the initiation of Order 66 and the subsequent confrontation between Yoda and Emperor Palpatine in 19 BBY, Thire and his troopers were ordered to hunt the Jedi Master. The failure to locate his body convinced Mas Amedda that Yoda was still alive, leading the Emperor to order Thire to resume the search. However, Yoda succeeded in escaping from Coruscant with the aid of Senator Bail Organa. Thire later accompanied Palpatine to Mustafar to recover the critically wounded Darth Vader.\n\n=== 501st Legion ===\nThe 501st Legion is a division of clone troopers under the command of Jedi General Anakin Skywalker and Padawan Commander [[Ahsoka Tano]]. It first appears unnamed in ''Revenge of the Sith'' under the leadership of Commander Appo, and they assault the Jedi Temple on Coruscant under Order 66. The 501st Legion also appears extensively throughout ''Star Wars Battlefront'' video game franchise and ''The Clone Wars'' television series, under the leadership of Captain Rex of Torrent Company. In the ''Star Wars Legends'' expanded universe, after the conversion of the Republic into the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]], the 501st Legion (nicknamed \"Vader's Fist\") is placed under the command of [[General Maximilian Veers]] that serves as [[Darth Vader]]'s personal battalion. Members of the 501st Legion wear armor with blue markings. The unit is named after the [[501st Legion]] costuming group.\n\nDuring ''[[Star Wars Celebration]]'' 2016, Dave Filoni stated that in a planned story arc for ''The Clone Wars'', Ahsoka, who has left the Jedi Order, is given command of part of the 501st Legion, including Captain Rex; those under her command repaint their helmets orange and adorn them with Ahsoka's togruta markings. She leads them at the siege of Mandalore, which takes place at the same time as the beginning of [[Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith|''Revenge of the Sith'']].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/the-untold-stories-of-ahsoka-tano-broke-our-hearts-and-1783725803|title=The Untold Stories of Ahsoka Tano Broke Our Hearts\u2014And Ahsoka's, Too|last=Whitbrook|first=James|date=July 15, 2016|website=|publisher=[[io9]]|access-date=July 15, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==== Commander Appo ====\nCommander Appo, CC-1119, served in the 501st Legion under the command of Jedi General Anakin Skywalker. He first appears in ''Episode III: Revenge of the Sith'', in which he and other members of the 501st carry out Order 66 and follow Anakin, now Darth Vader, in attacking the Jedi Temple on Coruscant.<ref name=\"Appo\" /> He stops Senator [[Bail Organa]] from entering the Temple.<ref name=\"RotS\" /> Appo later appears in season four of ''The Clone Wars'' television series as a sergeant in the 501st serving under clone Captain Rex. His armor bears blue markings. In ''The Clone Wars'' television series, his helmet is adorned with a white arrow in reference to [[Appa (character)|Appa]] of the ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]'' television series, on which ''The Clone Wars'' supervising director [[Dave Filoni]] worked.<ref name=\"Appo Trivia\" />\n\n==== Captain Rex ====\n{{main|Captain Rex}}\nCaptain Rex, CT-7567, leads Torrent Company of the 501st Legion, often under the command of Jedi General [[Anakin Skywalker]] and Jedi Commander [[Ahsoka Tano]].<ref name=\"Rex Databank\">{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/clone-captain-rex|title=Clone Captain Rex|last=|first=|date=|website=StarWars.com|publisher=[[Lucasfilm]]|access-date=January 14, 2016}}</ref> He first appears in ''The Clone Wars'' film and its related television series, and he is the primary clone trooper character of the series.

Now a much older man because of his accelerated aging, he lives on the wasteland planet Seelos and hunted worm-like joopa with Wolffe and Gregor before they are offered a place in the [[Rebel Alliance]].\n\n==== ARC Trooper Fives ====\nARC trooper Fives, CT-27-5555, serves alongside fellow ARC trooper Echo.<ref name=\"Fives Databank\">{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/arc-trooper-fives|title=ARC Trooper Fives|last=|first=|date=|website=StarWars.com|publisher=[[Lucasfilm]]|access-date=January 14, 2015}}</ref> He first appears in ''The Clone Wars'' season one episode \"Rookies\" as a regular trooper. He and his unit are assigned to a remote listening outpost that is invaded by Separatist droids. Though the invasion is successfully repelled, only Fives and Echo survive, and they are reassigned to the 501st Legion.<ref name=\"Rookies\" /> The season three episode \"Clone Cadets\" depicts Fives and his unit as cadets in training on [[Kamino (Star Wars)|Kamino]]. The unit, called Domino squad, is initially unable to work together to pass their final test. Fives and Echo feel weighed down by the others in the squad and ask to be reassigned, but the request is denied. Under the advice of Jedi General Shaak Ti, Fives and Echo recommit themselves to Domino, and the squad is able to pass. Fives and Echo are eventually promoted to ARC troopers together for their actions while defending Kamino and continue serving with the 501st. When assigned to the command of Jedi General Pong Krell, Fives finds Krell's disregard for clone trooper lives appalling and openly disagrees with Krell and with Captain Rex, who is insistent on following orders. Fives disobeys a direct order, and though his actions allow a Republic victory, Krell, without process of a [[court-martial]], finds Fives guilty of [[treason]] and sentences him to [[execution by firing squad]]. However, Fives urges his fellow troopers to see this as an injustice, and the firing squad refuses to execute him.\n\nIn season six, Fives discovers the inhibitor chip conspiracy, removing his own in the process, and attempts to warn the Republic that the clone trooper army can be used against the Jedi. However, Palpatine frames Fives for an assassination attempt, initiating a manhunt for Fives. Fives is able to contact Rex and Anakin Skywalker, and he attempts to warn them of the conspiracy and of Palpatine's involvement. He is ultimately killed by Commander Fox of the Coruscant Guard and dies in Rex's arms.\n\nFives' name is derived from his designation number (CT-27-5555), which features fives in sequence.<ref name=\"Rookies\" /> He is distinguished by a [[goatee]] and a stylized numeral five tattoo on his right temple. His armor bears blue markings, and a stylized worm creature adorns his helmets; after his promotion to ARC trooper, he also wears light gray pauldrons on his shoulders and kilt-like kama painted with blue stripes. He regards duty and honor above orders and protocol, feeling that there is no honor in following foolish orders and marching to his death. He insists that clone troopers be referred to by name, not number, and that they are soldiers, not units, and should be treated as such. He is a close friend of Rex and, after the apparent death of Echo, considers his best friend to be fellow trooper Tup, who aids Fives against Krell and is one of the first to refuse executing Fives when given the order by Krell. When Tup begins behaving abnormally, a result of an inhibitor chip malfunction, Fives goes to great lengths and disregards order to attempt to save Tup's life and, later, discover the true cause of Tup's death. With his dying words, he describes attempting to expose the conspiracy to have been his duty.\n\n==== ARC Trooper Echo ====\nARC trooper Echo, CT-21-0408,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/tv-shows/clone-wars/clone-cadets-trivia-gallery?dlid=56735fbcb6f86c976505f8b5|title=Clone Cadets Trivia Gallery|last=|first=|date=|website=StarWars.com|publisher=[[Lucasfilm]]|access-date=January 27, 2016}}</ref> sometimes CT-1409,<ref name=\"Echo Databank\">{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/arc-trooper-echo|title=ARC Trooper Echo|last=|first=|date=|website=StarWars.com|publisher=[[Lucasfilm]]|access-date=January 14, 2015}}</ref> serves alongside fellow ARC trooper Fives. He first appears in ''The Clone Wars'' season one episode \"Rookies\" as a regular trooper. He and his unit are assigned to a remote listening outpost that is invaded by Separatist droids. Though the invasion is successfully repelled, only Echo and Fives survive, and they are reassigned to the 501st Legion.<ref name=\"Rookies\" /> The season three episode \"Clone Cadets\" depicts Echo and his unit as cadets in training on Kamino. The unit, called Domino squad, is initially unable to work together to pass their final test. Echo and Fives feel weighed down by the others in the squad and ask to be reassigned, but the request is denied. Under the advice of Jedi General Shaak Ti, Echo and Fives recommit themselves to Domino, and the squad is able to pass. Echo and Fives are eventually promoted to ARC troopers together for their actions while defending Kamino and continue serving with the 501st. Echo is apparently killed in an explosion during a rescue operation in the season three episode \"Counter Attack\".\n\nStory reels for a previously-unfinished four episode arc called Bad Batch (Initially part of ''The Clone Wars'' Legacy project, the episodes were later released to Disney+ in their completed state) revealed that Echo survived and was captured by the Separatists. He was modified into a [[cyborg]] able to communicate directly to computers and tasked with decoding the Republic strategy [[algorithm]]. Echo is rescued by Captain Rex, and with his ability to understand Separatist transmissions, he plays a key role in a victory against the Separatists.\n\nEcho's armor bears blue markings, and a blue handprint adorns his chest-plate, created when Rex touched it while covered in eel blood during Echo's first mission. After his promotion to ARC trooper, Echo also wears light gray pauldrons on his shoulders and a kilt-like kama painted in an asymmetrical white and blue design. Later, after his rescue from Separatist capture, he is visibly a cyborg, with various apparatus protruding from his head and a droid plug in place of his right hand; post-rescue, he takes to wearing what appears to be a stripped-down variant on Standard Phase II Armor. Throughout his appearances, he is characterized as one who strictly follows orders, regulations, and protocol. Echo's name is given to him by Domino squad on Kamino as a sarcastic reference to his tendency to immediately repeat orders, even if his squad already heard.<ref name=\"Rookies\" />\n\n==== Trooper Kix ====\nKix, CT-6116, is a medic serving in the 501st Legion. In season six, Kix aids Fives, a fugitive because he discovered the inhibitor chip conspiracy. The short story \"The Crimson Corsair and the Lost Treasure of Count Dooku\" reveals that this action prompted Count Dooku to capture Kix, who discovered the conspiracy himself by the time of his capture. With droids failing to secure a confession, Kix was frozen in stasis for delivery to Dooku. The ship crashed into a planet during a randomized hyperspace jump to escape a Republic attack and protect \"Dooku's prize\". Fifty years later, Kix is released from stasis by pirates searching for \"the lost treasure of Count Dooku\". Kix is taken aboard the Corsair's ship and welcomed to their endeavor of raiding forgotten Separatist bases.<ref name=\"Corsair\" />\n\nKix is distinguished by his shaved hair and a phrase translating to \"a good droid is a dead one\" tattooed across his head. His armor bears blue markings, and his Phase II armor bears a red insignia marking him as a medic. He is \"dedicated to preserving the life of his brothers\", and he even tells an injured Captain Rex, \"As the team medic, when it comes to the health of the men, including you, I outrank everyone.\" However, he still has \"no qualms about fighting the enemy\".\n\n==== Trooper Jesse ====\nJesse, CT-5597, is a member in the 501st Legion. In season four, Jesse, like Fives comes to consider General Pong Krell to be ruthless and reckless (mainly over the casualty numbers). He later helps Fives and Hardcase on a rogue mission to destroy a Separatist supply ship, which succeeds at the cost of Hardcase's life.\n\nJesse is distinguished by his shaved hair with the Republic symbol tattooed on most of his head. His armor bears blue markings with the Republic symbol on the center.\n\n==== Trooper Tup ====\nTup, CT-5385, was part of the 501st legion under Captain Rex. He served in the Umbara campaign and was key to the capture of treasonous Jedi General Pong Krell, supporting and siding with his friend Fives even after Fives had been condemned to death by Krell and stunning the Jedi after a fierce battle with mutinous 501st clones led by Rex. In the sixth season, Tup suffered a malfunction in a biotechnical chip implanted in his brain shortly after his creation by the Kaminoans. Intended to ensure that the clones obeyed [[Order 66 (Star Wars)|Order 66]], the chip caused Tup to shoot and kill Jedi General Tiplar despite not having been ordered to. As Tup was being shipped back to Kamino for evaluation, he was kidnapped by the Separatists (who wanted to know why his chip had malfunctioned), only to be recovered shortly afterwards. Tup's actions led to the discovery of the chips by both the Jedi and the clones themselves, but Tup died of medical complications soon afterwards. Though Fives attempted to avenge Tup's death by finding the truth behind the chips, he was killed before he could reveal what he had learned, with Tup's actions and death officially declared to be the result of a locally acquired virus.\n\nTup's armor featured the blue markings common in the 501st, as well as an image of a single blue teardrop underneath the right eye of his helmet; this matched a tattoo on his face.\n\n===Special operations forces ===\nWithin the film series and in the [[Star Wars expanded universe|''Star Wars'' expanded universe]] media, a number of specialized trooper units are seen, including elite Republic [[special forces]] soldiers such as the 'Advanced Reconnaissance Commandos' (ARC troopers), and Null ARCs,<ref>\"Republic Commando: Triple Zero\"</ref> who usually work alone. All clone commandos and ARCs were trained by Mandalorian mercenaries; the elite Clone Troopers are known as Shadow Troopers.\n\nThe style and color of a clone troopers armor often varies depending on their rank, specialization, unit, or environment, for example, the clone troopers on Kashyyyk wear camouflage green scout-style armour whereas the 501st legion wears standard white armor with blue accents. Another example is the aquatic ''[[Scuba diving|SCUBA]]'' troopers, who appear in the animated series ''[[Star Wars: Clone Wars (TV series)|Star Wars: Clone Wars]]''. SCUBA troopers are equipped with high-tech breathing apparatuses and long range blaster rifles.<ref>{{cite book|title=Hard Contact|publisher=Del Rey Books|year=2004|isbn=0-345-47827-4|author=Traviss, Karen}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Triple Zero|publisher=Del Rey Books|year=2006|isbn=0-345-49009-6|author=Traviss, Karen}}</ref>\n\n====Clone Force 99====\n{{section-stub|date=February 2020}}\nClone Force 99\u2014informally known as \"The Bad Batch\"\u2014was a clone commando squad consisted of four clone troopers with personality querks that only slightly resemble normal clones\u2014the result of specially designed genetic experimentation.

During a mission on [[Kashyyyk]] at the end of the Clone Wars, depicted at the end of ''Republic Commando'', Sev's transmission signal is lost, and he is declared [[missing in action]]; his ultimate fate is uncertain. Sev is distinguished by red markings on his armor, and he is voiced by Jonathan David Cook. Fixer, RC-1140 and often referred to as simply 40, is the hacker and technical expert and is characterized as distant and stern; he is distinguished by green markings on his armor, and he is voiced by Andrew Chaikin.\n\n====Omega Squad====\nOmega Squad is a unit of four Republic commandos featured in the ''Republic Commando'' novels. The members wear black armor, and each man is the sole survivor of his previous unit. Omega is led by Sergeant Niner, RC-1309, who is characterized as serious and protective of the other men. Darman, RC-1136, is a demolitions expert; he falls in love with Jedi Etain Tur-Mukan, and they have a child.

Fi suffers a brain injury in ''True Colors'' and is declared legally dead when he falls into a coma; medical procedure requires he be [[Euthanasia|euthanized]], but he is taken to [[Mandalore]] where he eventually makes a full recovery. Atin, RC-3222, is the squad's technical expert, and he is described as quiet but deeply stubborn. Atin was trained by Walon Vau, unlike the others, and he initially harbors deep resentments for Vau. Corr, CT-5108/8843 later RC-5108/8843, joins the squad upon Fi's injury. Corr is a regular trooper who served as a bomb disposal expert; because of an injury, both arms from the elbows are prosthetic.\n\n==== Captain Gregor ====\nCaptain Gregor, CC-5576-39, is a former [[commando]] suffering [[amnesia]] and living on the distant planet Abafar. He is introduced in the season five episode \"Missing in Action\", where a stranded Republic mission discovers him working as a dishwasher in a diner. It is revealed that he lost his memories and sense of identity after a shuttle crash during a devastating battle. He was rescued by his employer, who keeps Gregor's true identity from him to prevent him from leaving, but Gregor is able to regain his sense of duty and his armor to help the Republic. Gregor holds off Separatist droids to allow the Republic mission to escape, and despite his promise to make his way home, he is seemingly killed in an explosion.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Missing in Action|series=Star Wars: The Clone Wars|series-link=Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|first1=Steward (Director)|last1=Lee|first2=Brent (Writer)|last2=Friedman|date=January 5, 2013|season=5|number=12}}</ref> He later appears in the ''Rebels'' television series, set fourteen years after ''Revenge of the Sith''.

He later appears in the ''Rebels'' television series, set fourteen years after ''Revenge of the Sith''. Wolffe is revealed to have removed his inhibitor chip, preventing him from carrying out Order 66. Now a much older man because of his accelerated aging, he lives on the wasteland planet Seelos and hunts worm-like joopa with Rex and Gregor. When they are sought by the rebel protagonists, Wolffe is suspicious of their motives and contacts the Empire to protect himself, Rex, and Gregor. Rex convinces him that the rebels can be trusted, and Wolffe regrets his actions.  He then thwarts an incoming attack from the Empire to save the rebels, and later on helps them free their planet from Imperial occupation once and for all.\n\nWolffe is distinguished by a scar running through his eye and a silver cybernetic eye implant. His armor is adorned with a gray stylized likeness of a wolf, and he wears a kilt-like kama. He is characterized as detail-oriented and as having \"a sense of strategy superior to that of most clone officers, making him a highly effective complement to Plo.\"<ref name=\"Wolffe Databank\" /> He is impatient with missions that send him away from the battlefield and becomes quickly exasperated with garrulous protocol droid [[C-3PO]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/clone-commander-wolffe-biography-gallery?dlid=561f0d21d35e5d7cff132789|title=Clone Commander Wolffe Biography Gallery|last=|first=|date=|website=StarWars.com|publisher=[[Lucasfilm]]|access-date=January 27, 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\nGraeme McMillan of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' felt the decision to make an army of clones is a \"softening of the ''Star Wars''{{'}} own mythology\", though the article later corrected that not all troopers in the franchise were clones. Noting that the films never specify that the clone troopers are replaced by regular soldiers by the original trilogy, he believed that the idea of soldiers who are created solely for war and are little more than machines \"sanitizes the war of the franchise's title\". He praised the decision of ''The Force Awakens'' to explicitly move away from clone troopers as bringing \"much-needed moral complexity\" to the film's conflict.<ref name=\"TFA THR\" />\n\n==See also==\n*[[Stormtrooper (Star Wars)|Stormtrooper (''Star Wars'')]]\n*[[501st Legion]]\n*[[Captain Rex]]\n\n==References==\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Appo\">{{cite web|url = http://www.starwars.com/databank/appo|title = Appo |date = |access-date = January 30, 2016|website = StarWars.com|publisher = [[Lucasfilm]]|last = |first = }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Appo Trivia\">{{cite web|url = http://www.starwars.com/tv-shows/clone-wars/the-general-trivia?dlid=5390fdbf0a172d315d0007c8|title = The General Trivia Gallery|date = |access-date = January 22, 2016|website = StarWars.com|publisher = [[Lucasfilm]]|last = |first = }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Archived Clone Troopers\">{{cite web|url = http://www.starwars.com/databank/organization/clonetroopers/index.html|title = Clone Troopers|date = |access-date = January 14, 2016|website = StarWars.com|publisher = [[Lucasfilm]]|last = |first = |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110724063805/http://www.starwars.com/databank/organization/clonetroopers/index.html|archive-date = July 24, 2011}}</ref> \n<ref name=\"Archived Cody\">{{cite web|url = http://www.starwars.com/databank/character/commandercody/index.html|title = Cody, Clone Commander|date = |access-date = January 14, 2016|website = StarWars.com|publisher = [[Lucasfilm]]|last = |first = |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110721000947/http://www.starwars.com/databank/character/commandercody/index.html|archive-date = July 21, 2011}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Bly Databank\">{{cite web|url = http://www.starwars.com/databank/clone-commander-bly|title = Clone Commander Bly|date = |access-date = January 14, 2016|website = StarWars.com|publisher = [[Lucasfilm]]|last = |first = }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Cody Databank\">{{cite web|url = http://www.starwars.com/databank/clone-commander-cody|title = Clone Commander Cody|date = |access-date = January 14, 2016|website = StarWars.com|publisher = [[Lucasfilm]]|last = |first = }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Coruscant Guard Databank\">{{cite web|url = http://www.starwars.com/databank/coruscant-guard|title = Coruscant Guard|date = |access-date = February 10, 2016|website = StarWars.com|publisher = [[Lucasfilm]]|last = |first = }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Gree Databank\">{{cite web|url = http://www.starwars.com/databank/clone-commander-gree|title = Clone Commander Gree|date = |access-date = January 14, 2016|website = StarWars.com|publisher = [[Lucasfilm]]|last = |first = }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"TFA THR\">{{cite web|url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/one-small-change-force-awakens-850277|title = One Small Change in 'Force Awakens' That Complicates the 'Star Wars' Series (Spoilers)|date = December 20, 2015|access-date = January 17, 2016|website = |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|last = McMillan|first = Graeme}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"AotC\">{{cite AV media |people= Lucas, George (Director)|year= 2002|title= [[Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones]]|medium= Motion picture}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"RotS\">{{cite AV media |people= Lucas, George (Director)|year= 2005|title= [[Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith]]|medium= Motion picture}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Rookies\">{{Cite episode |title= Rookies|series= Star Wars: The Clone Wars|series-link= Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|first1= Justin (Director)|last1= Ridge|first2=Steven (Writer)|last2=Melching|date= October 24, 2008|season= 1|number=5 }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"TCW Film\">{{cite AV media |people= Filoni, Dave (Director)|year= 2008|title= [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]|medium= Motion picture}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"TFA\">{{cite AV media |people= [[J.
