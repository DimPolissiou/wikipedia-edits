The 1980 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production, produced by [[David Merrick]], directed by an ailing [[Gower Champion]] and orchestrated by [[Philip J. Lang]], won the [[Tony Award]] for Best Musical and became a long-running hit. The show was produced in London in 1984 (winning the [[Olivier Award]] for Best Musical) and its 2001 Broadway revival won the Tony for Best Revival.\n\nBased on the novel by [[Bradford Ropes]] and the subsequent [[42nd Street (film)|1933 Hollywood film adaptation]], the [[backstage musical]] show focuses on the efforts of famed [[dictator]]ial [[Great White Way]] director Julian Marsh to mount a successful stage production of a musical extravaganza at the height of the [[Great Depression]].\n\nThe show is a [[jukebox musical]] of sorts, in that, in addition to songs from the 1933 film ''42nd Street'', it includes songs that Dubin and Warren wrote for many other films at around the same time, including ''[[Gold Diggers of 1933]]'', ''[[Roman Scandals]]'', ''[[Dames]]'', ''[[Gold Diggers of 1935]]'', ''[[Go into Your Dance]]'', ''[[Gold Diggers of 1937]]'' and ''[[The Singing Marine]]''. It also includes \"There's a Sunny Side to Every Situation\", written by Warren and Johnny Mercer for ''[[Hard to Get (1938 film)|Hard to Get]]''.

Billy Lawlor, already cast as one of the juvenile leads, notices her and hopes to charm her into accepting a date with him (\"Young and Healthy\"). He informs her she has missed the audition but he can help her bypass that process, but choreographer Andy Lee has no time for Billy's latest conquest and tells her, \"Amscray, toots.\" Embarrassed and flustered, she rushes off, only to run into director Julian Marsh.\n\nOne-time star Dorothy Brock, indignant at being asked to audition for a role, is reassured by Bert that he merely wants to make sure the songs are in her key (\"Shadow Waltz\"). Despite his feeling she is a [[prima donna]] past her prime, he agrees to cast her in order to get financial backing from her wealthy beau, Abner Dillon. Outside the theatre, writer Maggie and chorus girls Anytime Annie, Phyllis, and Lorraine take pity on Peggy and invite her to join them for lunch and some advice. They encourage her to show them a dance routine that is witnessed by Julian, who decides there might be room for one more chorus girl after all (\"Go Into Your Dance\").\n\nDorothy and Billy rehearse a kissing scene, but Abner refuses to put money into a show where he has to watch Dorothy kiss someone else. The kiss is removed from \"Pretty Lady\" (\"You're Getting to be a Habit With Me\").\n\nPeggy faints and is taken to Dorothy's dressing room. Pat is there and tries to help her. Dorothy finds them there together and assumes they are having an affair. She blows up at them. Julian overhears the argument and fears that Abner will take away funding for the show. He decides to put an end to the affair. A phone call to an unsavory acquaintance brings Pat a visit from a couple of [[criminal|thugs]] who convince him to break it off with her. The show's cast then departs to Arch Street Theatre in [[Philadelphia]], for the out-of-town tryout (\"Getting Out of Town\").\n\nThe scenery and costumes will not arrive on time, but the cast begins their dress rehearsal regardless (\"Dames\").\n\nA party is planned. Peggy asks Julian if he will be attending. He decides to go because he is attracted to Peggy (\"I Only Have Eyes For You\").\n\nDorothy is at the party and is drunk. She misses Pat, and she tells Abner she was only with him because of his money. She breaks it off with him. Abner wants to close the show, but he is convinced to keep it running. Dorothy finds Pat, but he is once again driven off by Julian at the hands of the gangsters. Peggy tries to warn Pat, and Dorothy catches them together, which makes her upset (\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\").\n\n\"Pretty Lady\" finally opens (\"We're in the Money\"), but someone bumps into Peggy, which causes her to knock over Dorothy. Dorothy cannot get up. This makes Julian angry. He fires Peggy immediately, and tells the audience that the show is canceled.\n\n; Act II\nDorothy's ankle is broken, and the show may close, but the chorus kids will not give up (\"Sunny Side to Every Situation\"). The chorus kids, certain Peggy could fill the lead role, find Julian and tell him that she's a fresh young face who can sing and dance circles around Dorothy. He decides it is worth a shot and rushes off to the train station to catch her before she departs.\n\nAt [[Broad Street Station (Philadelphia)|Philadelphia's ''Broad Street Station,'']] Julian apologizes to Peggy and asks her to stay and star in the show, but she responds that she has had enough of show business and wants to go home to Allentown. Dumbfounded, he tries to coax her with the words \"Come on along and listen to the lullaby of Broadway...\" After the cast joins him in the serenade, she decides to accept his offer (\"Lullaby of Broadway\").\n\nForced to learn the part in two days, Peggy is on the verge of a nervous breakdown when she has an unexpected visit from Dorothy, who has been watching the rehearsals and realizes that beneath her nervous exterior, Peggy is good, \"maybe even better than I would have been.\" She even offers a little friendly advice on how to perform the last song, \"[[About a Quarter to Nine]].\"\n\nIt's time for the curtain to rise again (\"Shuffle Off to Buffalo\"). The opening night curtain is about to rise when Julian, who is completely in love with Peggy at this point, stops by for a last minute lip-lock and pep talk in which he utters the now iconic line, \"You're going out there a youngster, but you've got to come back a star!\" The show is a huge success sure to catapult her into stardom (\"42nd Street\"). In addition, even though she is invited to and expected to attend the official opening night party, she decides to go to the chorus one instead. Julian is left alone onstage with only a single ghost light casting his huge shadow on the back wall. He quietly begins to sing, \"Come and meet those dancing feet on the avenue I'm taking you to...42nd Street\" (\"42nd Street (Reprise)\").\n\n==Characters==\nSource: Tams-Witmark Synopsis<ref>[http://www.tamswitmark.com/musicals/fortysecond.html \"'Forty-Second Street' Quick Review, Awards, Brief History, Synopsis\"] tamswitmark.com, accessed April 9, 2011</ref>\n\n*'''Peggy Sawyer (Lead)''' \u2013 Nervous but enthusiastic new chorus girl from [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]]\n*'''Billy Lawlor (Lead)''' \u2013 Leading [[tenor]] in ''Pretty Lady''\n*'''Dorothy Brock (Lead)''' \u2013 Past her prime Prima Donna, renowned for inability to dance\n*'''Julian Marsh (Lead)''' \u2013 Famous, but notorious, director\n*'''Maggie Jones (Support)''' \u2013 Co-writer and producer of ''Pretty Lady''\n*'''Bert Barry (Support)''' \u2013 Co-writer and producer of ''Pretty Lady''\n*'''Andy Lee (Support)''' \u2013 Choreographer/Dance Director\n*'''Pat Denning (Support)''' \u2013 Dorothy's former vaudeville partner and romantic interest\n*'''Abner Dillon (Support)''' \u2013 Producer of \"Pretty Lady\"; Dorothy's \"Sugar Daddy\" and Texan admirer\n*'''Mac (Support)''' \u2013 Stage Manager\n*'''Ann \u201cAnytime Annie\u201d Reilly, Lorraine Flemming, Phyllis Dale, and Gladys (Support)''' \u2013 Experienced chorus girls who help Peggy\n*'''Oscar''' \u2013 Onstage rehearsal pianist for the show \"Pretty Lady\"\n*'''Doctor'''\n*'''Other small speaking roles''' (Thugs, waiter, etc.)\n*'''Large Tap/Chorus Ensemble'''\n\n==Characters and original cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:1000;\"\n|-\n!

The 1980 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production, produced by [[David Merrick]], directed by an ailing [[Gower Champion]] and orchestrated by [[Philip J. Lang]], won the [[Tony Award]] for Best Musical and became a long-running hit. The show was produced in London in 1984 (winning the [[Olivier Award]] for Best Musical) and its 2001 Broadway revival won the Tony for Best Revival.\n\nBased on the novel by [[Bradford Ropes]] and the subsequent [[42nd Street (film)|1933 Hollywood film adaptation]], the [[backstage musical]] show focuses on the efforts of famed [[dictator]]ial [[Great White Way]] director Julian Marsh to mount a successful stage production of a musical extravaganza at the height of the [[Great Depression]].\n\nThe show is a [[jukebox musical]] of sorts, in that, in addition to songs from the 1933 film ''42nd Street'', it includes songs that Dubin and Warren wrote for many other films at around the same time, including ''[[Gold Diggers of 1933]]'', ''[[Roman Scandals]]'', ''[[Dames]]'', ''[[Gold Diggers of 1935]]'', ''[[Go into Your Dance]]'', ''[[Gold Diggers of 1937]]'' and ''[[The Singing Marine]]''. It also includes \"There's a Sunny Side to Every Situation\", written by Warren and Johnny Mercer for ''[[Hard to Get (1938 film)|Hard to Get]]''. A 2017 revival added the song \"[[Boulevard of Broken Dreams (Al Dubin song)|Boulevard of Broken Dreams]]\", written by Warren and Dubin for ''[[Moulin Rouge (1934 film)|Moulin Rouge]]''.\n\n==Background==\n[[theatre producer|Producer]] [[David Merrick]] \"took a huge gamble with his $3 million production based on the 1933 Warner Brothers film musical\", as \"only one other show had made the transfer from original movie musical to the stage \u2014 ''Gigi'', a flop in 1974.\"<ref name=pbs>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/broadway/musicals/42nd.html |title=42nd Street History|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110923125830/https://www.pbs.org/wnet/broadway/musicals/42nd.html |archive-date=September 23, 2011|access-date=March 10, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"sptimes\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.sptimes.com/2003/04/28/Floridian/Renovating__42nd_Stre.shtml |title=Floridian Renovating 42nd Street |last=Fleming |first=John |date=April 28, 2003 |website=[[St. Petersburg Times]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051029215029/http://www.sptimes.com/2003/04/28/Floridian/Renovating__42nd_Stre.shtml |archive-date=October 29, 2005}}</ref> He felt audiences once again were ready to embrace the [[nostalgia]] craze started by the successful revivals of ''[[No, No, Nanette]]'', ''[[Irene (musical)|Irene]]'', and his own ''[[Very Good Eddie]]'' several years earlier, and augmented the familiar songs from the film's soundtrack with a liberal dose of popular tunes from the Dubin-Warren catalog.<ref name=pbs/> According to theater historian [[John Kenrick (theatre writer)|John Kenrick]], \"When the curtain slowly rose to reveal forty pairs of tap-dancing feet, the star-studded opening night audience at the [[Winter Garden Theatre|Winter Garden]] cheered...Champion followed this number with a series of tap-infused extravaganzas larger and more polished than anything Broadway really had in the 1930s.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.musicals101.com/1980bway.htm |title=History of the Musical Stage: The 1980s |last=Kenrick |first=John |authorlink=John Kenrick (theatre writer) |date=1996\u20132004 |website=musicals101.com |archive-url=http://musicals101.com/1980bway.htm |archive-date=September 23, 2010 |access-date=November 3, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Productions==\n===Original Broadway===\nIn June 1980, the musical premiered in out-of-town tryouts at the [[Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref>Lardner, James. \"Familiar 'Street'; Hokey Tune of the '30s\", ''The Washington Post'', June 25, 1980, p.

Billy Lawlor, already cast as one of the juvenile leads, notices her and hopes to charm her into accepting a date with him (\"Young and Healthy\"). He informs her she has missed the audition but he can help her bypass that process, but choreographer Andy Lee has no time for Billy's latest conquest and tells her, \"Amscray, toots.\" Embarrassed and flustered, she rushes off, only to run into director Julian Marsh.\n\nOne-time star Dorothy Brock, indignant at being asked to audition for a role, is reassured by Bert that he merely wants to make sure the songs are in her key (\"Shadow Waltz\"). Despite his feeling she is a [[prima donna]] past her prime, he agrees to cast her in order to get financial backing from her wealthy beau, Abner Dillon. Outside the theatre, writer Maggie and chorus girls Anytime Annie, Phyllis, and Lorraine take pity on Peggy and invite her to join them for lunch and some advice. They encourage her to show them a dance routine that is witnessed by Julian, who decides there might be room for one more chorus girl after all (\"Go Into Your Dance\").\n\nDorothy and Billy rehearse a kissing scene, but Abner refuses to put money into a show where he has to watch Dorothy kiss someone else. The kiss is removed from \"Pretty Lady\" (\"You're Getting to be a Habit With Me\").\n\nPeggy faints and is taken to Dorothy's dressing room. Pat is there and tries to help her. Dorothy finds them there together and assumes they are having an affair. She blows up at them. Julian overhears the argument and fears that Abner will take away funding for the show. He decides to put an end to the affair. A phone call to an unsavory acquaintance brings Pat a visit from a couple of [[criminal|thugs]] who convince him to break it off with her. The show's cast then departs to Arch Street Theatre in [[Philadelphia]], for the out-of-town tryout (\"Getting Out of Town\").\n\nThe scenery and costumes will not arrive on time, but the cast begins their dress rehearsal regardless (\"Dames\").\n\nA party is planned. Peggy asks Julian if he will be attending. He decides to go because he is attracted to Peggy (\"I Only Have Eyes For You\").\n\nDorothy is at the party and is drunk. She misses Pat, and she tells Abner she was only with him because of his money. She breaks it off with him. Abner wants to close the show, but he is convinced to keep it running. Dorothy finds Pat, but he is once again driven off by Julian at the hands of the gangsters. Peggy tries to warn Pat, and Dorothy catches them together, which makes her upset (\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\").\n\n\"Pretty Lady\" finally opens (\"We're in the Money\"), but someone bumps into Peggy, which causes her to knock over Dorothy. Dorothy cannot get up. This makes Julian angry. He fires Peggy immediately, and tells the audience that the show is canceled.\n\n; Act II\nDorothy's ankle is broken, and the show may close, but the chorus kids will not give up (\"Sunny Side to Every Situation\"). The chorus kids, certain Peggy could fill the lead role, find Julian and tell him that she's a fresh young face who can sing and dance circles around Dorothy. He decides it is worth a shot and rushes off to the train station to catch her before she departs.\n\nAt [[Broad Street Station (Philadelphia)|Philadelphia's ''Broad Street Station,'']] Julian apologizes to Peggy and asks her to stay and star in the show, but she responds that she has had enough of show business and wants to go home to Allentown. Dumbfounded, he tries to coax her with the words \"Come on along and listen to the lullaby of Broadway...\" After the cast joins him in the serenade, she decides to accept his offer (\"Lullaby of Broadway\").\n\nForced to learn the part in two days, Peggy is on the verge of a nervous breakdown when she has an unexpected visit from Dorothy, who has been watching the rehearsals and realizes that beneath her nervous exterior, Peggy is good, \"maybe even better than I would have been.\" She even offers a little friendly advice on how to perform the last song, \"[[About a Quarter to Nine]].\"\n\nIt's time for the curtain to rise again (\"Shuffle Off to Buffalo\"). The opening night curtain is about to rise when Julian, who is completely in love with Peggy at this point, stops by for a last minute lip-lock and pep talk in which he utters the now iconic line, \"You're going out there a youngster, but you've got to come back a star!\" The show is a huge success sure to catapult her into stardom (\"42nd Street\"). In addition, even though she is invited to and expected to attend the official opening night party, she decides to go to the chorus one instead. Julian is left alone onstage with only a single ghost light casting his huge shadow on the back wall. He quietly begins to sing, \"Come and meet those dancing feet on the avenue I'm taking you to...42nd Street\" (\"42nd Street (Reprise)\").\n\n==Characters==\nSource: Tams-Witmark Synopsis<ref>[http://www.tamswitmark.com/musicals/fortysecond.html \"'Forty-Second Street' Quick Review, Awards, Brief History, Synopsis\"] tamswitmark.com, accessed April 9, 2011</ref>\n\n*'''Peggy Sawyer (Lead)''' \u2013 Nervous but enthusiastic new chorus girl from [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]]\n*'''Billy Lawlor (Lead)''' \u2013 Leading [[tenor]] in ''Pretty Lady''\n*'''Dorothy Brock (Lead)''' \u2013 Past her prime Prima Donna, renowned for inability to dance\n*'''Julian Marsh (Lead)''' \u2013 Famous, but notorious, director\n*'''Maggie Jones (Support)''' \u2013 Co-writer and producer of ''Pretty Lady''\n*'''Bert Barry (Support)''' \u2013 Co-writer and producer of ''Pretty Lady''\n*'''Andy Lee (Support)''' \u2013 Choreographer/Dance Director\n*'''Pat Denning (Support)''' \u2013 Dorothy's former vaudeville partner and romantic interest\n*'''Abner Dillon (Support)''' \u2013 Producer of \"Pretty Lady\"; Dorothy's \"Sugar Daddy\" and Texan admirer\n*'''Mac (Support)''' \u2013 Stage Manager\n*'''Ann \u201cAnytime Annie\u201d Reilly, Lorraine Flemming, Phyllis Dale, and Gladys (Support)''' \u2013 Experienced chorus girls who help Peggy\n*'''Oscar''' \u2013 Onstage rehearsal pianist for the show \"Pretty Lady\"\n*'''Doctor'''\n*'''Other small speaking roles''' (Thugs, waiter, etc.)\n*'''Large Tap/Chorus Ensemble'''\n\n==Characters and original cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:1000;\"\n|-\n!

Retrieved June 12, 2009.</ref>]]\n\nCargill was founded in 1865 by [[William W. Cargill]] when he bought a grain flat house in [[Conover, Iowa|Conover]], [[Iowa]]. A year later William was joined by his brother Sam, forming W. W. Cargill and Brother. Together, they built grain flat houses and opened a lumberyard. In 1875, Cargill moved to [[La Crosse, Wisconsin|La Crosse]], [[Wisconsin]], and their brother James joined the business. La Crosse was strategically located on the Mississippi near the junctions of the La Crosse River, Dubuque, and Southern Minnesota divisions of the [[Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad]].\n\nSam Cargill left La Crosse in 1887 to manage the office in [[Minneapolis]], an important emerging grain center. Three years later, the Minneapolis operation incorporated as Cargill Elevator Co.; some years after that the La Crosse operation incorporated as W. W. Cargill Company of La Crosse, Wisconsin. In 1898, John H. MacMillan, Sr., and his brother, Daniel, began working for W. W. Cargill. MacMillan then married William Cargill's eldest daughter, Edna.\n\n===20th century===\n\nUpon Sam Cargill's death in 1903, William Cargill became the sole owner of the La Crosse office. John MacMillan was named general manager of Cargill Elevator Company and moved his family to Minneapolis. William Cargill died in 1909, creating a fiscal crisis for the company. MacMillan worked to resolve the credit issues and to force his brother-in-law William S. Cargill out of the company. The current owners are descended from John MacMillan's two sons, John H. MacMillan, Jr., and Cargill MacMillan, Sr., and his youngest brother-in-law, Austen S. Cargill I.\n\nJohn MacMillan ran the company until his retirement in 1936. Under his leadership Cargill grew several fold, expanding out of the Midwest by opening its first East coast offices, in New York, in 1923, and the first Canadian, European and Latin American offices in 1928, 1929 and 1930. During this time, Cargill saw both record profits and major cash crunches.\n\nThe first of the crises was the debt left by the death of William W. Cargill. The company issued $2.25 million in Gold Notes, backed by Cargill stock, to pay off its creditors. The Gold Notes were due in 1917, but thanks to record grain prices caused by [[World War I]] all debts were paid by 1915.\n\nAs World War I continued into 1917, Cargill made record earnings and faced criticisms of [[war profiteer]]ing. Four years later, as a fallout from the financial crash of 1920, Cargill posted its first loss.\n\nOne of the biggest criticisms of the company has been its perceived arrogance (see, for example, Brewster Kneen in the ''Ecologist'' and also Greg Muttitt in the same journal). The MacMillans' aggressive management style led to a decades-long feud with the [[Chicago Board of Trade]]. It began in 1934, when the Board denied membership to Cargill. The US government overturned the Board's ruling and forced it to accept Cargill as a member. The 1936 corn crop failed and with the 1937 crop unavailable until October, the Chicago Board of Trade ordered Cargill to sell some of its corn. Cargill refused to comply.<ref name=\"Forbes1102\"/>\n\nThe US Commodity Exchange Authority and Chicago Board of Trade accused Cargill of trying to [[Cornering the market|corner]] the corn market. In 1938, the Chicago Board suspended Cargill and three of its officers from the trading floor. When the Board lifted its suspension a few years later, Cargill refused to rejoin, instead trading through independent traders. During [[World War II]], MacMillan, Jr., continued to expand the company, which boomed as it stored and transported grain and built ships for the [[United States Navy]].<ref name=\"Forbes1102\"/> In 1962, Cargill rejoined the Chicago Board of Trade, two years after MacMillan's death.\n\nIn 1960, Erwin Kelm became the first non-family chief executive. Aiming for expansion into [[Downstream (manufacturing)|downstream production]], he led the company into milling, [[starch]]es and [[syrup]]s. As the company grew, it developed a [[Market Intelligence|market intelligence]] network as it coordinated its commodities trading, processing, [[freight]], shipping and [[futures contract|futures]] businesses. In the decades before [[email]], the company relied on its own [[Teletypewriter message|telex-based]] system for internal communication.<ref name=\"Forbes1102\"/>\n[[File:Dust fills air as ships are loaded from the Cargill grain elevator - NARA - 551577.jpg|thumb|right|Dust fills the air as ships are loaded from a Cargill grain elevator in [[Duluth, Minnesota]], 1973]]\n\nWhen the [[Soviet Union]] entered the grain markets in the 1970s, demand grew to unprecedented levels, and Cargill benefitted. When [[Whitney MacMillan]], nephew of John, Jr., took over the company from Kelm in 1976, revenue approached $30 billion. US government put pressure on big grain exporters with allegations of manipulating the market, and Cargill was a major target, but it emerged without any major changes.<ref name=\"Forbes1102\"/>\n\nIn 1979, Cargill entered the meat-processing business with the purchase of beef processor MBPXL (later Excel).<ref name=excelhistory>{{cite web |url=https://appserver.excelmeats.com/about/history.htm |title=Excel History |website=ExcelMeats.com |accessdate=June 23, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816122055/https://appserver.excelmeats.com/about/history.htm |archive-date=August 16, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The division expanded into turkey, food service and food distribution businesses and is now known as [[Cargill Meat Solutions]].\n\nIn 1986 Cargill started operations in Venezuela through a partnership with the Possenti family's Mimesa C.A. to form Agroindustrial Mimesa in Maracaibo, dedicated to the manufacturing of flour and pasta. Expansion followed thereafter.<ref>https://www.cargill.com.ve/en/history-in-venezuela</ref>\n\nTensions arose with the company's private shareholders, as Cargill typically put 80% of earnings back into the business. By the early 1990s, members of the Cargill and MacMillan families became upset that their shares in the company were yielding mediocre [[dividend]]s. Demands rose for an [[initial public offering]] to turn the company public. The company responded with an employee stock ownership plan, and in 1993 reportedly purchased 17% of the firm for $730 million from 72 Cargills and MacMillans. It used that stake to begin the employee stock plan. The company's [[board of directors]] was reorganized to reduce the number of relatives to six, alongside six independents and five managers.<ref name=\"Forbes1102\"/>\n\n[[Ernest Micek]] took over as chief executive in August 1995. Cargill underwent turmoil in the following years; its financial unit lost hundreds of millions of dollars in 1998 when Russia defaulted on debt and developing countries began to have financial issues. The commodities and ingredients business, which was 75% of Cargill's total revenue, suffered from the [[1997 Asian Financial Crisis]].<ref name=\"Forbes1102\"/> Revenues fell by double-digit percentages for two years in a row, from $55.7 billion in 1997 to $51.4 billion in 1998 and $45.7 billion in 1999, while net income fell from $814 million in 1997 to $468 million in 1998 and $220 million in 1999.<ref name=\"FT022604\"/> By 1999, the company had $4 billion in debt.

A year later William was joined by his brother Sam, forming W. W. Cargill and Brother. Together, they built grain flat houses and opened a lumberyard. In 1875, Cargill moved to [[La Crosse, Wisconsin|La Crosse]], [[Wisconsin]], and their brother James joined the business. La Crosse was strategically located on the Mississippi near the junctions of the La Crosse River, Dubuque, and Southern Minnesota divisions of the [[Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad]].\n\nSam Cargill left La Crosse in 1887 to manage the office in [[Minneapolis]], an important emerging grain center. Three years later, the Minneapolis operation incorporated as Cargill Elevator Co.; some years after that the La Crosse operation incorporated as W. W. Cargill Company of La Crosse, Wisconsin. In 1898, John H. MacMillan, Sr., and his brother, Daniel, began working for W. W. Cargill. MacMillan then married William Cargill's eldest daughter, Edna.\n\n===20th century===\n\nUpon Sam Cargill's death in 1903, William Cargill became the sole owner of the La Crosse office. John MacMillan was named general manager of Cargill Elevator Company and moved his family to Minneapolis. William Cargill died in 1909, creating a fiscal crisis for the company. MacMillan worked to resolve the credit issues and to force his brother-in-law William S. Cargill out of the company. The current owners are descended from John MacMillan's two sons, John H. MacMillan, Jr., and Cargill MacMillan, Sr., and his youngest brother-in-law, Austen S. Cargill I.\n\nJohn MacMillan ran the company until his retirement in 1936. Under his leadership Cargill grew several fold, expanding out of the Midwest by opening its first East coast offices, in New York, in 1923, and the first Canadian, European and Latin American offices in 1928, 1929 and 1930. During this time, Cargill saw both record profits and major cash crunches.\n\nThe first of the crises was the debt left by the death of William W. Cargill. The company issued $2.25 million in Gold Notes, backed by Cargill stock, to pay off its creditors. The Gold Notes were due in 1917, but thanks to record grain prices caused by [[World War I]] all debts were paid by 1915.\n\nAs World War I continued into 1917, Cargill made record earnings and faced criticisms of [[war profiteer]]ing. Four years later, as a fallout from the financial crash of 1920, Cargill posted its first loss.\n\nOne of the biggest criticisms of the company has been its perceived arrogance (see, for example, Brewster Kneen in the ''Ecologist'' and also Greg Muttitt in the same journal). The MacMillans' aggressive management style led to a decades-long feud with the [[Chicago Board of Trade]]. It began in 1934, when the Board denied membership to Cargill. The US government overturned the Board's ruling and forced it to accept Cargill as a member. The 1936 corn crop failed and with the 1937 crop unavailable until October, the Chicago Board of Trade ordered Cargill to sell some of its corn. Cargill refused to comply.<ref name=\"Forbes1102\"/>\n\nThe US Commodity Exchange Authority and Chicago Board of Trade accused Cargill of trying to [[Cornering the market|corner]] the corn market. In 1938, the Chicago Board suspended Cargill and three of its officers from the trading floor. When the Board lifted its suspension a few years later, Cargill refused to rejoin, instead trading through independent traders. During [[World War II]], MacMillan, Jr., continued to expand the company, which boomed as it stored and transported grain and built ships for the [[United States Navy]].<ref name=\"Forbes1102\"/> In 1962, Cargill rejoined the Chicago Board of Trade, two years after MacMillan's death.\n\nIn 1960, Erwin Kelm became the first non-family chief executive. Aiming for expansion into [[Downstream (manufacturing)|downstream production]], he led the company into milling, [[starch]]es and [[syrup]]s. As the company grew, it developed a [[Market Intelligence|market intelligence]] network as it coordinated its commodities trading, processing, [[freight]], shipping and [[futures contract|futures]] businesses. In the decades before [[email]], the company relied on its own [[Teletypewriter message|telex-based]] system for internal communication.<ref name=\"Forbes1102\"/>\n[[File:Dust fills air as ships are loaded from the Cargill grain elevator - NARA - 551577.jpg|thumb|right|Dust fills the air as ships are loaded from a Cargill grain elevator in [[Duluth, Minnesota]], 1973]]\n\nWhen the [[Soviet Union]] entered the grain markets in the 1970s, demand grew to unprecedented levels, and Cargill benefitted. When [[Whitney MacMillan]], nephew of John, Jr., took over the company from Kelm in 1976, revenue approached $30 billion. US government put pressure on big grain exporters with allegations of manipulating the market, and Cargill was a major target, but it emerged without any major changes.<ref name=\"Forbes1102\"/>\n\nIn 1979, Cargill entered the meat-processing business with the purchase of beef processor MBPXL (later Excel).<ref name=excelhistory>{{cite web |url=https://appserver.excelmeats.com/about/history.htm |title=Excel History |website=ExcelMeats.com |accessdate=June 23, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816122055/https://appserver.excelmeats.com/about/history.htm |archive-date=August 16, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The division expanded into turkey, food service and food distribution businesses and is now known as [[Cargill Meat Solutions]].\n\nIn 1986 Cargill started operations in Venezuela through a partnership with the Possenti family's Mimesa C.A. to form Agroindustrial Mimesa in Maracaibo, dedicated to the manufacturing of flour and pasta. Expansion followed thereafter.<ref>https://www.cargill.com.ve/en/history-in-venezuela</ref>\n\nTensions arose with the company's private shareholders, as Cargill typically put 80% of earnings back into the business. By the early 1990s, members of the Cargill and MacMillan families became upset that their shares in the company were yielding mediocre [[dividend]]s. Demands rose for an [[initial public offering]] to turn the company public. The company responded with an employee stock ownership plan, and in 1993 reportedly purchased 17% of the firm for $730 million from 72 Cargills and MacMillans. It used that stake to begin the employee stock plan. The company's [[board of directors]] was reorganized to reduce the number of relatives to six, alongside six independents and five managers.<ref name=\"Forbes1102\"/>\n\n[[Ernest Micek]] took over as chief executive in August 1995. Cargill underwent turmoil in the following years; its financial unit lost hundreds of millions of dollars in 1998 when Russia defaulted on debt and developing countries began to have financial issues. The commodities and ingredients business, which was 75% of Cargill's total revenue, suffered from the [[1997 Asian Financial Crisis]].<ref name=\"Forbes1102\"/> Revenues fell by double-digit percentages for two years in a row, from $55.7 billion in 1997 to $51.4 billion in 1998 and $45.7 billion in 1999, while net income fell from $814 million in 1997 to $468 million in 1998 and $220 million in 1999.<ref name=\"FT022604\"/> By 1999, the company had $4 billion in debt. After a reduction in previously strong [[bond credit rating]], Micek announced he would step down a year early.<ref name=\"Forbes1102\"/>\n\n===2000s===\n\n[[Warren Staley]] became chief executive and continued expanding the company and it rebounded. By 2002, Cargill had over $50 billion in annual sales, twice the amount of its closest rival, [[Archer Daniels Midland]], and had 97,000 employees running more than 1,000 production sites and out of 59 countries.<ref name=\"Forbes1102\"/>  On June 1, 2007, Staley was succeeded by [[Gregory R. Page]]. Page was succeeded by current CEO and chairman Dave MacLennan in December 2013.\n\nCargill's quarterly profits exceeded $1 billion for the first time during the quarter ending on February 29, 2008 ($1.03 billion); the 86% rise was credited to global food shortages and the expanding [[biofuel]]s industry that, in turn, caused a rise in demand for Cargill's core areas of agricultural commodities and technology.<ref name=Strib041508>Matt McKinney, [http://www.startribune.com/business/17693669.html At $471,611 an hour, Cargill posts fine quarter], ''Star Tribune'', April 15, 2008.</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Kneen, Brewster |year=2003 |title=Size is Everything |journal=The Ecologist|volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=48\u201351}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Muttitt, Greg |year=2001 |title=Control Freaks |journal=The Ecologist |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=52 }}</ref>\n\nIn October 2011, the U.S. Justice Department announced that a biotech specialist at Cargill had pleaded guilty to stealing information from Cargill and [[Dow AgroSciences]].

It is known in the United Kingdom by its original title or in translation as '''''Lunch on the Grass'''''. A satire on contemporary science and politics, it revolves a prominent biologist and politician who wants to replace sex with [[artificial insemination]], but begins to reconsider when a picnic he organizes is interrupted by the forces of nature. The film brings up issues of [[modernity]], [[human reproduction]], youth and [[European integration]]. It ridicules [[Rationalism|rationalist]] [[idealism]] and celebrates a type of [[materialism]] it associates with [[classical mythology]] and [[ancient Greek philosophy]].\n\nThe title is taken from the painting ''[[Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe]]'' by [[\u00c9douard Manet]]. The female lead in ''Picnic on the Grass'' was the first major role for Rouvel, who due to an unusual contract would not appear in another film until 1963. Filming took place around Renoir's childhood home in [[Provence]], and inspiration came from the [[Impressionism|impressionist]] paintings of his father, [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]]. The filming technique was influenced by [[live television]] and involved [[Multiple-camera setup|multiple cameras]] and direct audio recording.\n\nThe press reviews were generally positive and described the film as charming and beautiful. Negative response came from the political left, where critics disapproved of the film's treatment of [[progress]] and depiction of a European [[superstate]]. The subject of European unification was topical and sensitive due to the creation of the [[European Economic Community]] in 1957. The film was a commercial failure and has attracted little attention from general audiences over the years.\n\n==Plot==\nThe famous biologist \u00c9tienne Alexis is the frontrunner in the upcoming election of the first President of [[United States of Europe|Europe]]. He advocates mandatory [[artificial insemination]] in order to [[Eugenics|improve humanity]] and make it worthy of modern science. He is newly engaged to his German cousin Marie-Charlotte and has invited her to a picnic near his mansion in [[Provence]].\n\nN\u00e9nette, a farmer's daughter, is disappointed with men after a failed relationship. She still wants children and applies to be a test subject for \u00c9tienne's insemination project. She ends up hired as his chambermaid and accompanies the picnic with the other servants. Present at the picnic are several cousins from both France and Germany. They are all stiff, rationally minded and profess belief in scientific [[progress]]. They have invited journalists to document the event as a symbol for the new unified Europe. The picnic takes place next to the ruins of a temple of [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], the goddess who the ancient Romans believed presided over childbirth. Nearby is also a group of young campers. N\u00e9nette is worried when she spots the goatherd Gaspard. She knows that when Gaspard plays his flute, strange things tend to happen. Gaspard plays and suddenly a strong wind blows away the picnic chairs and tables. As everybody takes cover, \u00c9tienne and N\u00e9nette are separated from the rest.\n\nWhen the wind subsides, they are invited to sit down with the campers. \u00c9tienne explains to the youth how he hopes to eliminate passion. Meanwhile, a [[Bacchanalia]] breaks out among the picnic guests not far away. Leaving the campers to look for Marie-Charlotte, \u00c9tienne ends up seeing N\u00e9nette [[Nude swimming|swimming nude]]. Shortly thereafter, Gaspard plays his flute again, and \u00c9tienne and N\u00e9nette run off into the high reeds. After returning, the two see the cousins and servants leaving in cars. They choose to not approach them and instead rejoin the campers, who offer them to stay the night in their camp. The next morning, \u00c9tienne says he wants to escape from the world for a while, so he and N\u00e9nette go to stay at N\u00e9nette's father Nino's house. \u00c9tienne begins to reconsider the relationship between humans and the natural world. The cousins eventually locate him and come to Nino's house. They convince N\u00e9nette to leave. Realizing she is gone, \u00c9tienne becomes agitated and goes to look for her. Gaspard, the goatherd, recommends him to kneel before his goat and ask for help. After doing so, \u00c9tienne turns ecstatic and shouts \"Down with science!\" before his cousins capture him.\n\n\u00c9tienne goes back to his old life, but on the day of his wedding he discovers N\u00e9nette working in a hotel kitchen. She is happily pregnant with his child. He abruptly brings her, not Marie-Charlotte, to the waiting crowd. He will launch his presidential campaign with a speech about science and nature, and he intends to marry N\u00e9nette.\n\n==Cast==\nCast adapted from ''A Companion to Jean Renoir'' and the [[British Film Institute]].{{sfnm|1a1=Phillips|1a2=Vincendeau|1y=2013|1p=583|2a1=British Film Institute}}\n* [[Paul Meurisse]] as Professor \u00c9tienne Alexis\n* [[Catherine Rouvel]] as N\u00e9nette\n* [[Fernand Sardou]] as Nino, N\u00e9nette's father\n* Jacqueline Morane as Titine, N\u00e9nette's elder sister\n* [[Jean-Pierre Granval]] as Ritou, Titine's husband\n* Ingrid Nordine as Marie-Charlotte\n* [[Charles Blavette]] as Gaspard, the old goatherd\n* [[Paulette Dubost]] as Mlle Forestier, the telephonist\n\n==Themes==\n===Modernity and nature===\n[[File:Pierre-Auguste Renoir 020.jpg|thumb|alt=Oil painting of a nude woman who sits on a rock and leans on a bow. At her feet is a dead deer with its neck pierced by an arrow.|''[[Diana (Renoir painting)|Diana]]'' by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, 1867]]\nThe themes of ''Picnic on the Grass'' revolve modern issues such as artificial insemination, the [[pharmaceutical industry]] and the [[mass media]]. [[Jean Renoir]]'s biographer [[Pascal M\u00e9rigeau]] writes that the film \"deals with disturbingly serious subjects using a farcical tone\".{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=700}} The film historian [[Jean Douchet]] writes that the film should be taken seriously, but describes its story as an invitation to not do so.{{sfn|Douchet|1974|p=295}} Renoir satirizes a [[modernity]] he does not think highly of, and uses story and tone to tell the viewer that it is not very important.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|pp=700\u2013701}}\n\nThe central conflict is built on several [[Dichotomy|dichotomies]]: between the [[Apollonian and Dionysian]], the [[Technocracy|technocratic]] [[Northern Europe]] and underdeveloped [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean region]], and the [[Rationalism|rationalist]] [[idealism]] of [[Postchristianity]] and [[Materialism|materialist]] [[Ancient Greek philosophy|philosophy of ancient Greece]].{{sfn|Douchet|1974|pp=298\u2013299}} ''Picnic on the Grass'' ridicules the idealist notion of progress and celebrates the Dionysian world.{{sfn|Douchet|1974|p=299}} The film portrays an empty spirituality produced by a bureaucratic [[utilitarianism]], and thereby seeks to justify the celebration of a material world imbued with spirit.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=349}} When \u00c9tienne converses with a Christian priest, the two are shown to have disagreements, but simultaneously understand each other well. This is because both still belong to the idealist side in the film's conflict.{{sfn|Douchet|1974|p=299}} According to Douchet, the film sets up a scenario where harmonious equilibrium is achieved when science abandons idealism and submits to a materialist view of nature. This happens when \u00c9tienne marries N\u00e9nette who is pregnant with their naturally conceived child.{{sfn|Douchet|1974|pp=299\u2013300}}\n\n\u00c9tienne is an intellectual who lives in a theoretical world. This makes him similar to the main characters in two earlier works by Renoir: the play ''Orvet'' (1955) and the television film ''[[The Doctor's Horrible Experiment]]'' (1959).{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=314}} \u00c9tienne's eugenic ideology combines rationalism and [[moralism]] in a way that gives [[Darwinism]] an active role in concord with [[individualism]]. [[Human reproduction]] and [[Human evolution|evolution]] become tied to \u00c9tienne's own [[Self-sustainability|self-sufficiency]] and to ideas about social responsibility.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|pp=349\u2013350}} N\u00e9nette is comfortable with her human physicality, but is also driven by self-sufficiency in her wish to have her own child through artificial insemination. She is [[Emancipation|emancipated]] and mobile, and it is her actions that twice bring her to \u00c9tienne. Another\u2014militaristic\u2014type of women's emancipation is represented by Marie-Charlotte.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=350}} Allied against Western rationalism are the gods [[Pan (god)|Pan]] and Diana. Pan is evoked through the flute-playing goatherd, and Diana presides over [[chastity]] and childbirth, which in this [[Classical mythology|classical mythological]] context are aspects of female independence.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=350}}\n\n===Youth===\n[[File:Renoir - PORTRAIT DE JEAN RENOIR, 1910.jpg|thumb|alt=Painted bust portrait of Jean Renoir as a young boy|Portrait of Jean Renoir by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, 1910]]\nRenoir had spent years of his childhood and adolescence in the area where ''Picnic on the Grass'' was filmed.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=700}} He had recently begun to write a book about his father, the painter [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], which made him reminisce about his early life.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=699}} Accordng to M\u00e9rigeau, the film was a way for Renoir to confront the boy he once was with the troubling questions of the contemporary world. Renoir's reconnection to his young self is paralleled in the mode of storytelling which is reminiscent of [[Silent film|silent cinema]]. Another parallel is with Renoir's film ''[[Partie de campagne]]'', filmed in 1936, and the similarities in its portrayal of eroticism.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=700}} The filmmaker [[Shirley Clarke]] said that ''Picnic on the Grass'' \"could only have been made by someone of 6 or 60\".{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=354}}\n\n===European integration===\nThe historian Hugo Frey groups ''Picnic on the Grass'' with a number of French comedies that deal with a \"modernist invasion\".{{sfn|Frey|2014|p=119}} These include the films of [[Jacques Tati]], ''[[Mr. Freedom]]'' (1968) by [[William Klein (photographer)|William Klein]] and ''[[The Holes]]'' (1974) by [[Pierre Tchernia]]. Renoir's film stands out in the group because it targets the nascent [[European Union]] rather than the United States.{{sfn|Frey|2014|pp=119\u2013120}}\n\nThe vision of a European [[superstate]] was conceived as the logical continuation of the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC), created in 1957 by the [[Treaty of Rome]]. The film's depiction of a French and German elite couple follows a convention where [[European integration]] is understood as something that particularly concerns France and Germany, or France and [[Germanic-speaking Europe]] overall. The way \u00c9tienne speaks to journalists, with technical and obscure terminology, envisions a future political elite as the only people who will comprehend the European project.{{sfn|Rivi\u00e8re|2018|pp=49\u201350}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nAfter working in [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] in the 1940s, Renoir had re-established himself in European cinema following the international success of ''[[The River (1951 film)|The River]]'' (1951). During the 1950s, he developed a more detached and depoliticized approach to filmmaking than before. Simultaneously, he became a more prominent celebrity in France due to television appearances and an increased appreciation for his films from the 1930s. His work became more oriented toward personal subjects.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|pp=328\u2013329}}\n\nThe title of ''Picnic on the Grass'' is taken from the painting ''[[Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe]]'' (1863) by [[\u00c9douard Manet]].{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=699}} Renoir wrote seven versions of the screenplay.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=701}} He made the film through his own production company, Compagnie Jean Renoir. It was the last time he did that; annoyances about logistics during the production made him decide to never produce his own films again. In addition to financial backing from [[Path\u00e9]] and the UCIF, Renoir offered 50% of his earnings from ''[[La Grande Illusion]]'' (1937) as a [[reimbursement]] guarantee, to a limit of 10 million [[French franc|francs]].{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=700}}\n\n===Pre-production===\n[[Catherine Rouvel]]\u2014whose real last name was Rouveyre\u2014did her first major role in ''Picnic on the Grass''. Renoir had met her in 1958, shortly after her 19th birthday, during a tribute to [[Robert J. Flaherty]] at the [[Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise]]. She accompanied her husband Georges Rouveyre whose friend Claude Beylie, who was a film critic, introduced her to Renoir. She had enrolled at the drama school Centre d'art dramatique de la rue Blanche a few weeks earlier. The same winter, Renoir contacted her for a reading and a screen test.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=697}} Before she won the role of N\u00e9nette, Renoir considered giving it to the dancer [[Ludmilla Tch\u00e9rina]], whom he had directed in a ballet. He also auditioned [[Mich\u00e8le Mercier]] the same day as Rouveyre. Renoir told Rouveyre in April 1959 that the role was hers. Soon thereafter he suggested that she should change her name to Rouvel.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=698}} For the male lead, Renoir first considered [[Pierre Blanchar]], a man in his mid 60s, before he gave the role to the 20 years younger [[Paul Meurisse]]. Renoir had previously worked with Meurisse in a production of ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' and the two were good friends.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=698}} In the role of the goatherd Gaspard he cast [[Charles Blavette]], who had played the title role in Renoir's film ''[[Toni (1935 film)|Toni]]'' (1935).{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=353}}\n\nRenoir rehearsed with the actors for a week before adding technicians to the rehearsals. After this, the director, designer, camera operator and assistant scouted the filming locations. The rehearsals then resumed with markers chalked on the floor corresponding to the locations' topography.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=347}} Working with markers was something Renoir abandoned after ''Picnic on the Grass'', because he thought it was better if the actors could discover the surroundings more freely.{{sfn|Renoir|1989|pp=185\u2013186}}\n\n===Filming and post-production===\n[[File:Cagnes-sur-Mer- Mus\u00e9e Renoir - Ferme -1.JPG|alt=Photograph of a stone house with three floors fronted by an old olive tree|thumb|The old farmhouse at Les Collettes was a filming location. The property was acquired by the city of Cagnes-sur-Mer in 1959 and turned into the Mus\u00e9e Renoir.{{sfn|Oddos|2016}}]]\nFilming took place from 6 to 30 July 1959 at Studio Franc\u0153ur in Paris, and in [[Cagnes-sur-Mer]] and [[La Gaude]] in [[Alpes-Maritimes]].{{sfn|Cin\u00e9-Ressources}} ''Picnic on the Grass'' borrows visual traits from French [[Impressionism|impressionist]] painting, and in particular that of Pierre-Auguste Renoir. This is reflected in the choices of filming locations. Jean Renoir called the film \"something of a homage to the olive-trees under which my father worked so much\".{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=353}} A major location was the property Les Collettes in Cagnes-sur-Mer, which Renoir the elder had bought in 1907, and which had been the home of Jean Renoir for a part of his childhood and adolescence.{{sfnm|1a1=Durgnat|1y=1974|1p=347|2a1=M\u00e9rigeau|2y=2017|2p=700}} Renoir the elder had spent significant time in the town La Gaude where a part of the film was shot. Several of his paintings feature the nearby river Le Coup, which also appears in the film.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=353}}\n\nAnother stylistic choice came from the director's desire to follow impulses on location and encourage improvisation. Renoir said he wanted to make a \"sort of filmed poem\" written in one sitting.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=347}} After the rehearsals, he gave very little instruction to the actors.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=347}} He used a rapid working method influenced by [[live television]].{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=700}} Renoir had first used this technique in his recent television film ''The Doctor's Horrible Experiment'', which he called an \"experimental film\".{{sfn|Renoir|1974|p=276}} He took advantage of the cinematographer's experience from making [[newsreel]] footage. [[Multiple-camera setup|Six cameras were placed around the scene]] to cover all useful angles and shots.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=347}} In addition to saving time and money, the ambition was to retain the uninterrupted, intensive acting of a [[long take]] and still be able to make cuts within the scene.{{sfn|Renoir|1974|pp=276\u2013277}} The method made it possible to record most of the dialogue directly, without problems of continuity due to surrounding sounds such as those from airplanes. Up to twelve microphones were present and only around 20 phrases had to be dubbed in post-production.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=347}}\n\nSeveral key crew members were reused from ''The Doctor's Horrible Experiment''. They included the cinematographer Georges Leclerc and the editor Ren\u00e9e Lichtig. Both would work with Renoir again on his next film, ''[[The Elusive Corporal]]'', which became his final feature film.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=700}} The working method was however not used again.{{sfn|Renoir|1974|p=277}} The original music was composed by [[Joseph Kosma]], who first collaborated with Renoir in 1936 and had provided music for several of his best known films.{{sfn|Hischak|2015|p=412}} The score for ''Picnic on the Grass'' includes a melody the goatherd plays in high pitch on his flute during the wind scene, an upbeat piece played on clarinet in jazz style, and a melody played on flute with harp [[glissando]]s during a lyrical passage.{{sfn|Hischak|2015|p=413}}\n\n==Release==\nPath\u00e9 released ''Picnic on the Grass'' theatrically in France on 11 November 1959.{{sfn|Faulkner|1979|p=160}} In the United Kingdom it was released by Mondial Films in April 1960 under the title ''Lunch on the Grass''.{{sfn|British Board of Film Classification}} It was released in the United States as ''Picnic on the Grass'' on 12 October 1960 by [[Kingsley-International Pictures]].{{sfn|Faulkner|1979|p=160}}\n\nFor the French home-media market, it was first released on [[VHS]] in 1990 by Fil \u00e0 film and on [[DVD]] in 2003 by [[StudioCanal|StudioCanal vid\u00e9o]]. The DVD, which was re-released in 2008, includes a 30-minute documentary directed by Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois Glaymann.{{sfn|BnF Catalogue g\u00e9n\u00e9ral}} The film was released on DVD in the United Kingdom in 2007 by [[StudioCanal UK|Optimum Releasing]], as part of a box set with other Renoir films. The DVD uses the original French title, ''Le D\u00e9jeuner Sur L'Herbe''.{{sfn|French|2007}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Contemporary critical response===\nFrench film critics generally gave ''Picnic on the Grass'' a positive reception, characterized by respect for Renoir. They highlighted the film's connection to impressionism and described it as charming.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=356}} Rouvel's face was on the cover of the December 1959 issue of ''[[Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma]]'', and the magazine called the film \"the most beautiful of a month rich in masterpieces\".{{sfn|Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma, December 1959|loc=inside of the front cover}}{{efn|{{lang|fr|Pour l'\u00e9quipe des \u00ab Cahiers \u00bb et le Conseil des Dix, le film de Jean Renoir est le plus beau d'un mois riche en chefs-d'\u0153uvre.}}}} The review by [[\u00c9ric Rohmer]] stressed the technical novelty of the film, released in \"the year of the '[[French New Wave|New Wave]]'\", which Renoir had influenced profoundly.{{sfn|Rohmer|1959|p=2}}{{efn|{{lang|fr|... l'ann\u00e9e de la \u00ab nouvelle vague \u00bb ...}}}} With its detached and intentionally naive style, Rohmer described it as \"avant-garde popular theater\" in the vein of ''[[Mr Puntila and his Man Matti]]''.{{sfn|Rohmer|1959|p=4}}{{efn|{{lang|fr|... th\u00e9\u00e2tre populaire d'avant-garde ...}}}} For Rohmer, the satire against science should be understood through Renoir's role as an artist, not philosopher or moralist, and not as a rejection of practical science.{{sfn|Rohmer|1959|p=6}} As for politics, he defended the artist's right to look at the problems of the world without being politically engaged.{{sfn|Rohmer|1959|p=7}} ''Picnic on the Grass'' made 13th place on ''Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma'''s composite list of the best films of 1959.{{sfn|Hillier|1985|p=287}} [[Pierre Braunberger]], [[Jean-Luc Godard]], [[Jacques Rivette]], Rohmer and [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]] were among the ''Cahiers'' critics who named it to year-end top ten lists.{{sfn|Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma, February 1960|pp=1\u20132}}\n\n[[File:Jean Renoir (1959).tif|thumb|left|alt=Black and white photograph of Jean Renoir in his mid 60s|Jean Renoir in 1959]]\nRenoir had supported the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF) in the 1930s, but ''Picnic on the Grass'' received negative reviews from critics with [[Communism|communist]] sympathies. It was released at a time when the PCF idealized progress and its members were enthusiastic about the [[Soviet space program]].{{sfn|Marie|2013|pp=328 and 340}} Samuel Lachize of ''[[L'Humanit\u00e9]]'' considered the film flawed on a technical level, and criticized its lack of a clear choice between scientific progress and the rejection of it. He dismissed the philosophical content, which he took as a pseudo-[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseauesque]] message about going [[back to nature]].{{sfn|Lachize|1959|p=2|ps=, quoted in {{harvtxt|Marie|2013|pp=338\u2013339}}}} ''The Doctor's Horrible Experiment'' received a similar treatment from communist critics.{{sfn|Marie|2013|pp=339\u2013340}} Left-wing critics also criticized ''Picnic on the Grass'' for its eventual acceptance of a European superstate, which was taken as an approval of the EEC, opposed by the left at the time. Furthermore upsetting for the left, the reservations \u00c9tienne develops were interpreted as support for [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s {{lang|fr|Europe des patries}} (\"Europe of fatherlands\").{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|pp=350\u2013352}} In the 1970s, the film critic [[Raymond Durgnat]] related the response to the left's own struggle to oppose the EEC without turning to patriotism. Durgnat wrote that it was \"perhaps not too unkind to suggest that my left-wing colleagues were making their 'lost leader' a scapegoat for the very real difficulties of the left itself\u2014or should one say the lefts themselves?\"{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=352}}\n\nGideon Bachmann wrote in ''[[Film Quarterly]]'' that many American critics gave ''Picnic on the Grass'' a \"silly treatment\", because they did not understand it through its director as a person. He used [[Hollis Alpert]] of the ''[[Saturday Review (U.S. magazine)|Saturday Review]]'' as a positive counterexample.{{sfn|Bachmann|1960|p=40}} Alpert called it \"a nonsensically unconventional movie\" where viewers \"would be better off not trying to make sense or logic out of it, but simply allowing M. Renoir to have his day in the fields\".{{sfn|Alpert|1960|p=34}} Bachmann wrote that the film is reminiscent of Tati's films, both in message and how the message is conveyed through colors.{{sfn|Bachmann|1960|p=40}} He contrasted the seeming simplicity with the serious content, and the impressionism with the surreal elements. He called it \"almost facile in impact but lasting in the perturbations it causes\".{{sfn|Bachmann|1960|p=41}}\n\n===Retrospective critical response===\n''Picnic on the Grass'' has received little attention from general audiences over time, but it has been embraced by individual critics.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=701}} In 2006, Luc Arbona of ''[[Les Inrockuptibles]]'' called it an \"extraordinary pamphlet\" portraying \"the peddlers of progress\" who \"only care about security, asepticity and uniformity\".{{sfn|Arbona|2006}}{{efn|{{lang|fr|Renoir r\u00e9alise ici un extraordinaire pamphlet o\u00f9 il met en sc\u00e8ne les camelots du progr\u00e8s qui se contrefoutent du monde, de la nature et ne se soucient que de s\u00e9curisation, d'aseptisation et d'uniformisation.}}}} Arbona called the satire \"abuntant and exhilirating\" and the film \"brilliantly prophetic\", because by the time of his writing, Arbona wrote, \"these progress-obsessed, these ad-agency apostles who have nothing but the politically correct to say, have seized power and are leading the dance.\"{{sfn|Arbona|2006}}{{efn|{{lang|fr|Satire foisonnante et jubilatoire, Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe est g\u00e9nialement proph\u00e9tique.

Taking its message as a rejection of modern technology, he still compared it favorably to [[Steven Soderbergh]]'s ''[[Contagion (2011 film)|Contagion]]'', which shows science and the government triumphant in a crisis of natural origin. Brody made a point of separating art and politics: \"Looking to filmmakers for practical advice in the teeth of trouble is usually as pointless as turning to politicians for visions of beauty.\"{{sfn|Brody|2012}} ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' called it \"one of Renoir's most ravishing, and simultaneously most irritating films\", because the \"sumptuous photography\" repeatedly \"collapses into cold argument\".{{sfn|Time Out}}\n\n===Box office===\n''Picnic on the Grass'' had 757,024 admissions in France.{{sfn|AlloCin\u00e9}} It was a commercial failure. Renoir addressed this in a letter to the producer Ginette Doynel a few weeks after the Paris premiere. He wrote that the failure had given him a distaste for film and television work in general. He would instead focus on his teaching position at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], his plays, and his book about his father.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=701}} ''Picnic on the Grass'' later had a significant theatrical run in the United States, which delighted Renoir.{{sfn|Silke|2005|p=134}}\n\n==Legacy==\nRouvel signed an unusual contract which had the practical effect that Renoir had to approve all her engagements for the next three years. Renoir decided to keep her away from the film industry and only accepted offers of theater roles. He rejected roles in ''[[The Green Mare (film)|The Green Mare]]'' and a film by [[G\u00e9rard Oury]]. Rouvel returned to film acting in [[Claude Chabrol]]'s ''[[Landru (film)|Bluebeard]]'', released in January 1963.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|pp=699\u2013700}}\n\nThe film ''[[Le Bonheur (1965 film)|Le Bonheur]]'' (1965) directed by [[Agn\u00e8s Varda]] pays tribute to ''Picnic on the Grass'' by including a passage which plays on a television screen.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=734}} The film scholar Nancy Pogel argues in her book on [[Woody Allen]] that Allen's ''[[A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy]]'' (1982) is indebted to ''Picnic on the Grass''.{{sfn|Nichols|2000|p=95}}\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[The Farm at Les Collettes, Cagnes]]''\n* [[France\u2013Germany relations]]\n* [[Pan in popular culture]]\n* [[Physis]] and [[techne]]\n* [[Reproduction and pregnancy in speculative fiction]]\n\n==References==\n===Original quotations===\n{{notelist}}\n===Notes===\n{{reflist}}\n===Sources===\n{{Refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n: {{cite web |author=[[AlloCin\u00e9]] |url=http://www.allocine.fr/film/fichefilm_gen_cfilm=72342.html |title=Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe |language=French |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208035056/http://www.allocine.fr/film/fichefilm_gen_cfilm=72342.html |publisher=Tiger Global |archive-date=8 December 2015 |accessdate=17 March 2020 |ref=CITEREFAlloCin\u00e9 }}\n\n: {{cite news |last=Alpert |first=Hollis |authorlink=Hollis Alpert |date=15 October 1960 |url=https://www.unz.com/print/SaturdayRev-1960oct15-00034/ |title=Panic on the Grass |work=[[Saturday Review (U.S. magazine)|Saturday Review]] |accessdate=17 March 2020 |ref=harv }}\n\n: {{cite news |last=Arbona |first=Luc |date=17 August 2006 |url=https://www.lesinrocks.com/cinema/films-a-l-affiche/le-dejeuner-sur-lherbe/ |title=le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe |work=[[Les Inrockuptibles]] |language=French |accessdate=2 March 2020 |ref=harv }}\n\n: {{cite journal |last=Bachmann |first=Gideon |year=1960 |title=Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l'Herbe |journal=[[Film Quarterly]] |volume=14 |issue=2 |pp=40\u201341 |doi=10.2307/1210350 |ref=harv }}\n\n: {{cite web |author=BnF Catalogue g\u00e9n\u00e9ral |url=https://data.bnf.fr/en/16179534/le_dejeuner_sur_l_herbe___film/ |title=Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe : film |publisher=[[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France]] |accessdate=17 March 2020 |ref=harv }}\n\n: {{cite web |author=[[British Board of Film Classification]] |url=https://bbfc.co.uk/releases/lunch-grass-1959 |title=Lunch on the Grass |accessdate=17 March 2020 |ref=harv }}\n\n: {{cite web |author=[[British Film Institute]] |url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6a8a022a |title=Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe |accessdate=18 March 2020 |ref=harv }}\n\n: {{cite news |last=Brody |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Brody |date=29 October 2012 |url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/watching-sandy-with-jean-renoir |title=Watching Sandy with Jean Renoir |work=[[The New Yorker]] |accessdate=2 March 2020 |ref=harv }}\n\n: {{cite journal |date=December 1959 |title=Notre couverture |trans-title=Our cover |journal=[[Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma]] |language=French |issue=102 |ref=CITEREFCahiers du cin\u00e9ma, December 1959 }}\n\n: {{cite journal |date=February 1960 |title=Les dix meilleurs films de l'ann\u00e9e |trans-title=The ten best films of the year |journal=Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma |language=French |issue=104 |ref=CITEREFCahiers du cin\u00e9ma, February 1960 }}\n\n: {{cite web |author=[[Cin\u00e9-Ressources]] |url=http://cinema.encyclopedie.films.bifi.fr/index.php?pk=50831 |title=Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe |language=French |publisher=[[Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise]] |accessdate=26 February 2020 |ref=CITEREFCin\u00e9-Ressources }}\n\n: {{cite book |last=Douchet |first=Jean |authorlink=Jean Douchet |year=1974 |chapter=Le Dejeuner sur l'Herbe (1959) (Picnic on the Grass, 1960) |editor-last=Truffaut |editor-first=Fran\u00e7ois |editorlink=Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut |translator1-last=Halsey II |translator1-first=W.

It is known in the United Kingdom by its original title or in translation as '''''Lunch on the Grass'''''. A satire on contemporary science and politics, it revolves a prominent biologist and politician who wants to replace sex with [[artificial insemination]], but begins to reconsider when a picnic he organizes is interrupted by the forces of nature. The film brings up issues of [[modernity]], [[human reproduction]], youth and [[European integration]]. It ridicules [[Rationalism|rationalist]] [[idealism]] and celebrates a type of [[materialism]] it associates with [[classical mythology]] and [[ancient Greek philosophy]].\n\nThe title is taken from the painting ''[[Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe]]'' by [[\u00c9douard Manet]]. The female lead in ''Picnic on the Grass'' was the first major role for Rouvel, who due to an unusual contract would not appear in another film until 1963. Filming took place around Renoir's childhood home in [[Provence]], and inspiration came from the [[Impressionism|impressionist]] paintings of his father, [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]]. The filming technique was influenced by [[live television]] and involved [[Multiple-camera setup|multiple cameras]] and direct audio recording.\n\nThe press reviews were generally positive and described the film as charming and beautiful. Negative response came from the political left, where critics disapproved of the film's treatment of [[progress]] and depiction of a European [[superstate]]. The subject of European unification was topical and sensitive due to the creation of the [[European Economic Community]] in 1957. The film was a commercial failure and has attracted little attention from general audiences over the years.\n\n==Plot==\nThe famous biologist \u00c9tienne Alexis is the frontrunner in the upcoming election of the first President of [[United States of Europe|Europe]]. He advocates mandatory [[artificial insemination]] in order to [[Eugenics|improve humanity]] and make it worthy of modern science. He is newly engaged to his German cousin Marie-Charlotte and has invited her to a picnic near his mansion in [[Provence]].\n\nN\u00e9nette, a farmer's daughter, is disappointed with men after a failed relationship. She still wants children and applies to be a test subject for \u00c9tienne's insemination project. She ends up hired as his chambermaid and accompanies the picnic with the other servants. Present at the picnic are several cousins from both France and Germany. They are all stiff, rationally minded and profess belief in scientific [[progress]]. They have invited journalists to document the event as a symbol for the new unified Europe. The picnic takes place next to the ruins of a temple of [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], the goddess who the ancient Romans believed presided over childbirth. Nearby is also a group of young campers. N\u00e9nette is worried when she spots the goatherd Gaspard. She knows that when Gaspard plays his flute, strange things tend to happen. Gaspard plays and suddenly a strong wind blows away the picnic chairs and tables. As everybody takes cover, \u00c9tienne and N\u00e9nette are separated from the rest.\n\nWhen the wind subsides, they are invited to sit down with the campers. \u00c9tienne explains to the youth how he hopes to eliminate passion. Meanwhile, a [[Bacchanalia]] breaks out among the picnic guests not far away. Leaving the campers to look for Marie-Charlotte, \u00c9tienne ends up seeing N\u00e9nette [[Nude swimming|swimming nude]]. Shortly thereafter, Gaspard plays his flute again, and \u00c9tienne and N\u00e9nette run off into the high reeds. After returning, the two see the cousins and servants leaving in cars. They choose to not approach them and instead rejoin the campers, who offer them to stay the night in their camp. The next morning, \u00c9tienne says he wants to escape from the world for a while, so he and N\u00e9nette go to stay at N\u00e9nette's father Nino's house. \u00c9tienne begins to reconsider the relationship between humans and the natural world. The cousins eventually locate him and come to Nino's house. They convince N\u00e9nette to leave. Realizing she is gone, \u00c9tienne becomes agitated and goes to look for her. Gaspard, the goatherd, recommends him to kneel before his goat and ask for help. After doing so, \u00c9tienne turns ecstatic and shouts \"Down with science!\" before his cousins capture him.\n\n\u00c9tienne goes back to his old life, but on the day of his wedding he discovers N\u00e9nette working in a hotel kitchen. She is happily pregnant with his child. He abruptly brings her, not Marie-Charlotte, to the waiting crowd. He will launch his presidential campaign with a speech about science and nature, and he intends to marry N\u00e9nette.\n\n==Cast==\nCast adapted from ''A Companion to Jean Renoir'' and the [[British Film Institute]].{{sfnm|1a1=Phillips|1a2=Vincendeau|1y=2013|1p=583|2a1=British Film Institute}}\n* [[Paul Meurisse]] as Professor \u00c9tienne Alexis\n* [[Catherine Rouvel]] as N\u00e9nette\n* [[Fernand Sardou]] as Nino, N\u00e9nette's father\n* Jacqueline Morane as Titine, N\u00e9nette's elder sister\n* [[Jean-Pierre Granval]] as Ritou, Titine's husband\n* Ingrid Nordine as Marie-Charlotte\n* [[Charles Blavette]] as Gaspard, the old goatherd\n* [[Paulette Dubost]] as Mlle Forestier, the telephonist\n\n==Themes==\n===Modernity and nature===\n[[File:Pierre-Auguste Renoir 020.jpg|thumb|alt=Oil painting of a nude woman who sits on a rock and leans on a bow. At her feet is a dead deer with its neck pierced by an arrow.|''[[Diana (Renoir painting)|Diana]]'' by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, 1867]]\nThe themes of ''Picnic on the Grass'' revolve modern issues such as artificial insemination, the [[pharmaceutical industry]] and the [[mass media]]. [[Jean Renoir]]'s biographer [[Pascal M\u00e9rigeau]] writes that the film \"deals with disturbingly serious subjects using a farcical tone\".{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=700}} The film historian [[Jean Douchet]] writes that the film should be taken seriously, but describes its story as an invitation to not do so.{{sfn|Douchet|1974|p=295}} Renoir satirizes a [[modernity]] he does not think highly of, and uses story and tone to tell the viewer that it is not very important.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|pp=700\u2013701}}\n\nThe central conflict is built on several [[Dichotomy|dichotomies]]: between the [[Apollonian and Dionysian]], the [[Technocracy|technocratic]] [[Northern Europe]] and underdeveloped [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean region]], and the [[Rationalism|rationalist]] [[idealism]] of [[Postchristianity]] and [[Materialism|materialist]] [[Ancient Greek philosophy|philosophy of ancient Greece]].{{sfn|Douchet|1974|pp=298\u2013299}} ''Picnic on the Grass'' ridicules the idealist notion of progress and celebrates the Dionysian world.{{sfn|Douchet|1974|p=299}} The film portrays an empty spirituality produced by a bureaucratic [[utilitarianism]], and thereby seeks to justify the celebration of a material world imbued with spirit.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=349}} When \u00c9tienne converses with a Christian priest, the two are shown to have disagreements, but simultaneously understand each other well. This is because both still belong to the idealist side in the film's conflict.{{sfn|Douchet|1974|p=299}} According to Douchet, the film sets up a scenario where harmonious equilibrium is achieved when science abandons idealism and submits to a materialist view of nature. This happens when \u00c9tienne marries N\u00e9nette who is pregnant with their naturally conceived child.{{sfn|Douchet|1974|pp=299\u2013300}}\n\n\u00c9tienne is an intellectual who lives in a theoretical world. This makes him similar to the main characters in two earlier works by Renoir: the play ''Orvet'' (1955) and the television film ''[[The Doctor's Horrible Experiment]]'' (1959).{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=314}} \u00c9tienne's eugenic ideology combines rationalism and [[moralism]] in a way that gives [[Darwinism]] an active role in concord with [[individualism]]. [[Human reproduction]] and [[Human evolution|evolution]] become tied to \u00c9tienne's own [[Self-sustainability|self-sufficiency]] and to ideas about social responsibility.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|pp=349\u2013350}} N\u00e9nette is comfortable with her human physicality, but is also driven by self-sufficiency in her wish to have her own child through artificial insemination. She is [[Emancipation|emancipated]] and mobile, and it is her actions that twice bring her to \u00c9tienne. Another\u2014militaristic\u2014type of women's emancipation is represented by Marie-Charlotte.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=350}} Allied against Western rationalism are the gods [[Pan (god)|Pan]] and Diana. Pan is evoked through the flute-playing goatherd, and Diana presides over [[chastity]] and childbirth, which in this [[Classical mythology|classical mythological]] context are aspects of female independence.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=350}}\n\n===Youth===\n[[File:Renoir - PORTRAIT DE JEAN RENOIR, 1910.jpg|thumb|alt=Painted bust portrait of Jean Renoir as a young boy|Portrait of Jean Renoir by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, 1910]]\nRenoir had spent years of his childhood and adolescence in the area where ''Picnic on the Grass'' was filmed.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=700}} He had recently begun to write a book about his father, the painter [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], which made him reminisce about his early life.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=699}} Accordng to M\u00e9rigeau, the film was a way for Renoir to confront the boy he once was with the troubling questions of the contemporary world. Renoir's reconnection to his young self is paralleled in the mode of storytelling which is reminiscent of [[Silent film|silent cinema]]. Another parallel is with Renoir's film ''[[Partie de campagne]]'', filmed in 1936, and the similarities in its portrayal of eroticism.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=700}} The filmmaker [[Shirley Clarke]] said that ''Picnic on the Grass'' \"could only have been made by someone of 6 or 60\".{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=354}}\n\n===European integration===\nThe historian Hugo Frey groups ''Picnic on the Grass'' with a number of French comedies that deal with a \"modernist invasion\".{{sfn|Frey|2014|p=119}} These include the films of [[Jacques Tati]], ''[[Mr. Freedom]]'' (1968) by [[William Klein (photographer)|William Klein]] and ''[[The Holes]]'' (1974) by [[Pierre Tchernia]]. Renoir's film stands out in the group because it targets the nascent [[European Union]] rather than the United States.{{sfn|Frey|2014|pp=119\u2013120}}\n\nThe vision of a European [[superstate]] was conceived as the logical continuation of the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC), created in 1957 by the [[Treaty of Rome]]. The film's depiction of a French and German elite couple follows a convention where [[European integration]] is understood as something that particularly concerns France and Germany, or France and [[Germanic-speaking Europe]] overall. The way \u00c9tienne speaks to journalists, with technical and obscure terminology, envisions a future political elite as the only people who will comprehend the European project.{{sfn|Rivi\u00e8re|2018|pp=49\u201350}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nAfter working in [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] in the 1940s, Renoir had re-established himself in European cinema following the international success of ''[[The River (1951 film)|The River]]'' (1951). During the 1950s, he developed a more detached and depoliticized approach to filmmaking than before. Simultaneously, he became a more prominent celebrity in France due to television appearances and an increased appreciation for his films from the 1930s. His work became more oriented toward personal subjects.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|pp=328\u2013329}}\n\nThe title of ''Picnic on the Grass'' is taken from the painting ''[[Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe]]'' (1863) by [[\u00c9douard Manet]].{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=699}} Renoir wrote seven versions of the screenplay.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=701}} He made the film through his own production company, Compagnie Jean Renoir. It was the last time he did that; annoyances about logistics during the production made him decide to never produce his own films again. In addition to financial backing from [[Path\u00e9]] and the UCIF, Renoir offered 50% of his earnings from ''[[La Grande Illusion]]'' (1937) as a [[reimbursement]] guarantee, to a limit of 10 million [[French franc|francs]].{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=700}}\n\n===Pre-production===\n[[Catherine Rouvel]]\u2014whose real last name was Rouveyre\u2014did her first major role in ''Picnic on the Grass''. Renoir had met her in 1958, shortly after her 19th birthday, during a tribute to [[Robert J. Flaherty]] at the [[Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise]]. She accompanied her husband Georges Rouveyre whose friend Claude Beylie, who was a film critic, introduced her to Renoir. She had enrolled at the drama school Centre d'art dramatique de la rue Blanche a few weeks earlier. The same winter, Renoir contacted her for a reading and a screen test.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=697}} Before she won the role of N\u00e9nette, Renoir considered giving it to the dancer [[Ludmilla Tch\u00e9rina]], whom he had directed in a ballet. He also auditioned [[Mich\u00e8le Mercier]] the same day as Rouveyre. Renoir told Rouveyre in April 1959 that the role was hers. Soon thereafter he suggested that she should change her name to Rouvel.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=698}} For the male lead, Renoir first considered [[Pierre Blanchar]], a man in his mid 60s, before he gave the role to the 20 years younger [[Paul Meurisse]]. Renoir had previously worked with Meurisse in a production of ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' and the two were good friends.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=698}} In the role of the goatherd Gaspard he cast [[Charles Blavette]], who had played the title role in Renoir's film ''[[Toni (1935 film)|Toni]]'' (1935).{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=353}}\n\nRenoir rehearsed with the actors for a week before adding technicians to the rehearsals. After this, the director, designer, camera operator and assistant scouted the filming locations. The rehearsals then resumed with markers chalked on the floor corresponding to the locations' topography.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=347}} Working with markers was something Renoir abandoned after ''Picnic on the Grass'', because he thought it was better if the actors could discover the surroundings more freely.{{sfn|Renoir|1989|pp=185\u2013186}}\n\n===Filming and post-production===\n[[File:Cagnes-sur-Mer- Mus\u00e9e Renoir - Ferme -1.JPG|alt=Photograph of a stone house with three floors fronted by an old olive tree|thumb|The old farmhouse at Les Collettes was a filming location. The property was acquired by the city of Cagnes-sur-Mer in 1959 and turned into the Mus\u00e9e Renoir.{{sfn|Oddos|2016}}]]\nFilming took place from 6 to 30 July 1959 at Studio Franc\u0153ur in Paris, and in [[Cagnes-sur-Mer]] and [[La Gaude]] in [[Alpes-Maritimes]].{{sfn|Cin\u00e9-Ressources}} ''Picnic on the Grass'' borrows visual traits from French [[Impressionism|impressionist]] painting, and in particular that of Pierre-Auguste Renoir. This is reflected in the choices of filming locations. Jean Renoir called the film \"something of a homage to the olive-trees under which my father worked so much\".{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=353}} A major location was the property Les Collettes in Cagnes-sur-Mer, which Renoir the elder had bought in 1907, and which had been the home of Jean Renoir for a part of his childhood and adolescence.{{sfnm|1a1=Durgnat|1y=1974|1p=347|2a1=M\u00e9rigeau|2y=2017|2p=700}} Renoir the elder had spent significant time in the town La Gaude where a part of the film was shot. Several of his paintings feature the nearby river Le Coup, which also appears in the film.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=353}}\n\nAnother stylistic choice came from the director's desire to follow impulses on location and encourage improvisation. Renoir said he wanted to make a \"sort of filmed poem\" written in one sitting.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=347}} After the rehearsals, he gave very little instruction to the actors.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=347}} He used a rapid working method influenced by [[live television]].{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=700}} Renoir had first used this technique in his recent television film ''The Doctor's Horrible Experiment'', which he called an \"experimental film\".{{sfn|Renoir|1974|p=276}} He took advantage of the cinematographer's experience from making [[newsreel]] footage. [[Multiple-camera setup|Six cameras were placed around the scene]] to cover all useful angles and shots.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=347}} In addition to saving time and money, the ambition was to retain the uninterrupted, intensive acting of a [[long take]] and still be able to make cuts within the scene.{{sfn|Renoir|1974|pp=276\u2013277}} The method made it possible to record most of the dialogue directly, without problems of continuity due to surrounding sounds such as those from airplanes. Up to twelve microphones were present and only around 20 phrases had to be dubbed in post-production.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=347}}\n\nSeveral key crew members were reused from ''The Doctor's Horrible Experiment''. They included the cinematographer Georges Leclerc and the editor Ren\u00e9e Lichtig.

The DVD, which was re-released in 2008, includes a 30-minute documentary directed by Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois Glaymann.{{sfn|BnF Catalogue g\u00e9n\u00e9ral}} The film was released on DVD in the United Kingdom in 2007 by [[StudioCanal UK|Optimum Releasing]], as part of a box set with other Renoir films. The DVD uses the original French title, ''Le D\u00e9jeuner Sur L'Herbe''.{{sfn|French|2007}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Contemporary critical response===\nFrench film critics generally gave ''Picnic on the Grass'' a positive reception, characterized by respect for Renoir. They highlighted the film's connection to impressionism and described it as charming.{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=356}} Rouvel's face was on the cover of the December 1959 issue of ''[[Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma]]'', and the magazine called the film \"the most beautiful of a month rich in masterpieces\".{{sfn|Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma, December 1959|loc=inside of the front cover}}{{efn|{{lang|fr|Pour l'\u00e9quipe des \u00ab Cahiers \u00bb et le Conseil des Dix, le film de Jean Renoir est le plus beau d'un mois riche en chefs-d'\u0153uvre.}}}} The review by [[\u00c9ric Rohmer]] stressed the technical novelty of the film, released in \"the year of the '[[French New Wave|New Wave]]'\", which Renoir had influenced profoundly.{{sfn|Rohmer|1959|p=2}}{{efn|{{lang|fr|... l'ann\u00e9e de la \u00ab nouvelle vague \u00bb ...}}}} With its detached and intentionally naive style, Rohmer described it as \"avant-garde popular theater\" in the vein of ''[[Mr Puntila and his Man Matti]]''.{{sfn|Rohmer|1959|p=4}}{{efn|{{lang|fr|... th\u00e9\u00e2tre populaire d'avant-garde ...}}}} For Rohmer, the satire against science should be understood through Renoir's role as an artist, not philosopher or moralist, and not as a rejection of practical science.{{sfn|Rohmer|1959|p=6}} As for politics, he defended the artist's right to look at the problems of the world without being politically engaged.{{sfn|Rohmer|1959|p=7}} ''Picnic on the Grass'' made 13th place on ''Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma'''s composite list of the best films of 1959.{{sfn|Hillier|1985|p=287}} [[Pierre Braunberger]], [[Jean-Luc Godard]], [[Jacques Rivette]], Rohmer and [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]] were among the ''Cahiers'' critics who named it to year-end top ten lists.{{sfn|Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma, February 1960|pp=1\u20132}}\n\n[[File:Jean Renoir (1959).tif|thumb|left|alt=Black and white photograph of Jean Renoir in his mid 60s|Jean Renoir in 1959]]\nRenoir had supported the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF) in the 1930s, but ''Picnic on the Grass'' received negative reviews from critics with [[Communism|communist]] sympathies. It was released at a time when the PCF idealized progress and its members were enthusiastic about the [[Soviet space program]].{{sfn|Marie|2013|pp=328 and 340}} Samuel Lachize of ''[[L'Humanit\u00e9]]'' considered the film flawed on a technical level, and criticized its lack of a clear choice between scientific progress and the rejection of it. He dismissed the philosophical content, which he took as a pseudo-[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseauesque]] message about going [[back to nature]].{{sfn|Lachize|1959|p=2|ps=, quoted in {{harvtxt|Marie|2013|pp=338\u2013339}}}} ''The Doctor's Horrible Experiment'' received a similar treatment from communist critics.{{sfn|Marie|2013|pp=339\u2013340}} Left-wing critics also criticized ''Picnic on the Grass'' for its eventual acceptance of a European superstate, which was taken as an approval of the EEC, opposed by the left at the time. Furthermore upsetting for the left, the reservations \u00c9tienne develops were interpreted as support for [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s {{lang|fr|Europe des patries}} (\"Europe of fatherlands\").{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|pp=350\u2013352}} In the 1970s, the film critic [[Raymond Durgnat]] related the response to the left's own struggle to oppose the EEC without turning to patriotism. Durgnat wrote that it was \"perhaps not too unkind to suggest that my left-wing colleagues were making their 'lost leader' a scapegoat for the very real difficulties of the left itself\u2014or should one say the lefts themselves?\"{{sfn|Durgnat|1974|p=352}}\n\nGideon Bachmann wrote in ''[[Film Quarterly]]'' that many American critics gave ''Picnic on the Grass'' a \"silly treatment\", because they did not understand it through its director as a person. He used [[Hollis Alpert]] of the ''[[Saturday Review (U.S. magazine)|Saturday Review]]'' as a positive counterexample.{{sfn|Bachmann|1960|p=40}} Alpert called it \"a nonsensically unconventional movie\" where viewers \"would be better off not trying to make sense or logic out of it, but simply allowing M. Renoir to have his day in the fields\".{{sfn|Alpert|1960|p=34}} Bachmann wrote that the film is reminiscent of Tati's films, both in message and how the message is conveyed through colors.{{sfn|Bachmann|1960|p=40}} He contrasted the seeming simplicity with the serious content, and the impressionism with the surreal elements. He called it \"almost facile in impact but lasting in the perturbations it causes\".{{sfn|Bachmann|1960|p=41}}\n\n===Retrospective critical response===\n''Picnic on the Grass'' has received little attention from general audiences over time, but it has been embraced by individual critics.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=701}} In 2006, Luc Arbona of ''[[Les Inrockuptibles]]'' called it an \"extraordinary pamphlet\" portraying \"the peddlers of progress\" who \"only care about security, asepticity and uniformity\".{{sfn|Arbona|2006}}{{efn|{{lang|fr|Renoir r\u00e9alise ici un extraordinaire pamphlet o\u00f9 il met en sc\u00e8ne les camelots du progr\u00e8s qui se contrefoutent du monde, de la nature et ne se soucient que de s\u00e9curisation, d'aseptisation et d'uniformisation.}}}} Arbona called the satire \"abuntant and exhilirating\" and the film \"brilliantly prophetic\", because by the time of his writing, Arbona wrote, \"these progress-obsessed, these ad-agency apostles who have nothing but the politically correct to say, have seized power and are leading the dance.\"{{sfn|Arbona|2006}}{{efn|{{lang|fr|Satire foisonnante et jubilatoire, Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe est g\u00e9nialement proph\u00e9tique.

Taking its message as a rejection of modern technology, he still compared it favorably to [[Steven Soderbergh]]'s ''[[Contagion (2011 film)|Contagion]]'', which shows science and the government triumphant in a crisis of natural origin. Brody made a point of separating art and politics: \"Looking to filmmakers for practical advice in the teeth of trouble is usually as pointless as turning to politicians for visions of beauty.\"{{sfn|Brody|2012}} ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' called it \"one of Renoir's most ravishing, and simultaneously most irritating films\", because the \"sumptuous photography\" repeatedly \"collapses into cold argument\".{{sfn|Time Out}}\n\n===Box office===\n''Picnic on the Grass'' had 757,024 admissions in France.{{sfn|AlloCin\u00e9}} It was a commercial failure. Renoir addressed this in a letter to the producer Ginette Doynel a few weeks after the Paris premiere. He wrote that the failure had given him a distaste for film and television work in general. He would instead focus on his teaching position at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], his plays, and his book about his father.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=701}} ''Picnic on the Grass'' later had a significant theatrical run in the United States, which delighted Renoir.{{sfn|Silke|2005|p=134}}\n\n==Legacy==\nRouvel signed an unusual contract which had the practical effect that Renoir had to approve all her engagements for the next three years. Renoir decided to keep her away from the film industry and only accepted offers of theater roles. He rejected roles in ''[[The Green Mare (film)|The Green Mare]]'' and a film by [[G\u00e9rard Oury]]. Rouvel returned to film acting in [[Claude Chabrol]]'s ''[[Landru (film)|Bluebeard]]'', released in January 1963.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|pp=699\u2013700}}\n\nThe film ''[[Le Bonheur (1965 film)|Le Bonheur]]'' (1965) directed by [[Agn\u00e8s Varda]] pays tribute to ''Picnic on the Grass'' by including a passage which plays on a television screen.{{sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|2017|p=734}} The film scholar Nancy Pogel argues in her book on [[Woody Allen]] that Allen's ''[[A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy]]'' (1982) is indebted to ''Picnic on the Grass''.{{sfn|Nichols|2000|p=95}}\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[The Farm at Les Collettes, Cagnes]]''\n* [[France\u2013Germany relations]]\n* [[Pan in popular culture]]\n* [[Physis]] and [[techne]]\n* [[Reproduction and pregnancy in speculative fiction]]\n\n==References==\n===Original quotations===\n{{notelist}}\n===Notes===\n{{reflist}}\n===Sources===\n{{Refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n: {{cite web |author=[[AlloCin\u00e9]] |url=http://www.allocine.fr/film/fichefilm_gen_cfilm=72342.html |title=Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe |language=French |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208035056/http://www.allocine.fr/film/fichefilm_gen_cfilm=72342.html |publisher=Tiger Global |archive-date=8 December 2015 |accessdate=17 March 2020 |ref=CITEREFAlloCin\u00e9 }}\n\n: {{cite news |last=Alpert |first=Hollis |authorlink=Hollis Alpert |date=15 October 1960 |url=https://www.unz.com/print/SaturdayRev-1960oct15-00034/ |title=Panic on the Grass |work=[[Saturday Review (U.S. magazine)|Saturday Review]] |accessdate=17 March 2020 |ref=harv }}\n\n: {{cite news |last=Arbona |first=Luc |date=17 August 2006 |url=https://www.lesinrocks.com/cinema/films-a-l-affiche/le-dejeuner-sur-lherbe/ |title=le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe |work=[[Les Inrockuptibles]] |language=French |accessdate=2 March 2020 |ref=harv }}\n\n: {{cite journal |last=Bachmann |first=Gideon |year=1960 |title=Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l'Herbe |journal=[[Film Quarterly]] |volume=14 |issue=2 |pp=40\u201341 |doi=10.2307/1210350 |ref=harv }}\n\n: {{cite web |author=BnF Catalogue g\u00e9n\u00e9ral |url=https://data.bnf.fr/en/16179534/le_dejeuner_sur_l_herbe___film/ |title=Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe : film |publisher=[[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France]] |accessdate=17 March 2020 |ref=harv }}\n\n: {{cite web |author=[[British Board of Film Classification]] |url=https://bbfc.co.uk/releases/lunch-grass-1959 |title=Lunch on the Grass |accessdate=17 March 2020 |ref=harv }}\n\n: {{cite web |author=[[British Film Institute]] |url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6a8a022a |title=Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe |accessdate=18 March 2020 |ref=harv }}\n\n: {{cite news |last=Brody |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Brody |date=29 October 2012 |url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/watching-sandy-with-jean-renoir |title=Watching Sandy with Jean Renoir |work=[[The New Yorker]] |accessdate=2 March 2020 |ref=harv }}\n\n: {{cite journal |year=1959 |title=Notre couverture |trans-title=Our cover |journal=[[Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma]] |language=French |volume=17 |issue=12 |ref=CITEREFCahiers du cin\u00e9ma, December 1959 }}\n\n: {{cite journal |year=1960 |title=Les dix meilleurs films de l'ann\u00e9e |trans-title=The ten best films of the year |journal=Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma |language=French |volume=18 |issue=2 |ref=CITEREFCahiers du cin\u00e9ma, February 1960 }}\n\n: {{cite web |author=[[Cin\u00e9-Ressources]] |url=http://cinema.encyclopedie.films.bifi.fr/index.php?pk=50831 |title=Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe |language=French |publisher=[[Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise]] |accessdate=26 February 2020 |ref=CITEREFCin\u00e9-Ressources }}\n\n: {{cite book |last=Douchet |first=Jean |authorlink=Jean Douchet |year=1974 |chapter=Le Dejeuner sur l'Herbe (1959) (Picnic on the Grass, 1960) |editor-last=Truffaut |editor-first=Fran\u00e7ois |editorlink=Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut |translator1-last=Halsey II |translator1-first=W.

Reeves was born five months into their marriage<ref>Fox, Alma Archer. \"My Cousin Superman\", ''Galesburg Register-Mail'', June 15, 1979.</ref> and the couple separated soon after Reeves's birth. At this time, Reeves and his mother moved from Iowa to her home of [[Galesburg, Illinois]].<ref name=\"Galesburg RegMail article\">{{cite web|url=http://www.galesburg.com/article/20140920/ENTERTAINMENTLIFE/140929987|title='Superman' absent in Mom's time of need|publisher=Galesburg Register Mail|date=September 20, 2014|accessdate=March 12, 2015|author=Tom Wilson}}</ref>\n\nLater, Reeves's mother,<ref>Helen Roberta Lescher Brewer Bessolo (1894\u20131964) was the daughter of George Christian Lescher and Eliza Jane McKenzie, she died in a Pasadena hospital on June 18, 1964.</ref> who was of [[German descent]], moved to California to stay with her sister. There she met and married Frank Joseph Bessolo while Reeves's father married Helen Schultz in 1925. Reeves reportedly never saw his father again. In 1927, Frank Bessolo adopted George as his own son, and the boy took on his stepfather's last name, becoming '''George Bessolo'''.<ref name=\"Superman Homepage\">{{cite web|url=http://www.supermanhomepage.com/tv/tv.php?topic=cast-crew/george-reeves|title=Superman Homepage|accessdate=June 16, 2007}}</ref> The Bessolo marriage lasted 15 years, ending in divorce, with the couple separating while Reeves was away visiting relatives. When he returned, his mother told him his stepfather had committed suicide.\n\nAccording to biographer [[Jim Beaver]], Reeves did not know for several years that Bessolo was still alive. Reeves began acting and singing in high school and continued performing on stage as a student at [[Pasadena Junior College]].<ref>''Pasadena Junior College Courier'', 1934</ref>\n\n==Acting career==\nWhile studying acting at the [[Pasadena Playhouse]], Reeves met his future wife, Ellanora Needles. They married on September 22, 1940, in [[San Gabriel, California]], at the Church of Our Savior. They had no children and divorced 10 years later.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nReeves's film career began in 1939 when he was cast as Stuart Tarleton (incorrectly listed in the film's credits as Brent Tarleton), one of [[Scarlett O'Hara]]'s suitors in ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''. It was a minor role, but he and [[Fred Crane (actor)|Fred Crane]] were in the film's opening scene. (Reeves and Crane both dyed their hair red to portray the Tarleton twins.) After ''Gone with the Wind'' was filmed, Reeves returned to the Pasadena Playhouse and was given the lead role in the play ''Poncho''. This part directly led to him being contracted to [[Warner Brothers]].<ref name=CloserOwn>{{cite web |last=Gross |first=Ed |title=The Life and Tragic Death of \u2018Superman\u2019 Star George Reeves \u2014 Plus the Actor in his Own Words |url=https://www.supermanhomepage.com/tv/tv.php?topic=cast-crew/george-reeves |website=[[Closer (magazine)|Closer]] |accessdate=26 December 2019 |date=October 28, 2019}}</ref> Warner changed his professional name to George Reeves.<ref name=\"Superman Homepage\"/> His ''Gone with the Wind'' screen credit reflects the change. Between the start of ''Gone With the Wind'' production and its release 12 months later, several films on his Warner contract were made and released, making ''Gone With the Wind'' his first film role, but his fifth film release.\n\nHe starred in a number of two-reel short subjects and appeared in several B-pictures, including two with [[Ronald Reagan]] and three with [[James Cagney]] (''[[Torrid Zone]]'', ''[[The Fighting 69th]]'', and ''[[The Strawberry Blonde]]''). These roles did little to advance Reeves' career, and his contract with Warners was dissolved by mutual consent.<ref name=CloserOwn/>\n\nReleased from his Warner contract, he signed a contract at [[Twentieth Century-Fox]], but was released after only a handful of films, one of which was the [[Charlie Chan]] movie ''[[Dead Men Tell]]''. Twentieth Century-Fox loaned him to producer [[Alexander Korda]] to co-star with [[Merle Oberon]] in ''[[Lydia (film)|Lydia]]'',<ref name=CloserOwn/> a box-office failure. He freelanced, looking to find work in westerns.<ref name=CloserOwn/> His friend [[Teddi Sherman]] introduced him to her producer father [[Harry Sherman]], who asked Reeves to do a [[screen test]] with Teddi for the [[Hopalong Cassidy]] films. Reeves and Sherman impressed the casting director by performing seven pages of script without pause in a single take.<ref name=CloserOwn/> Reeves appeared in five Hopalong Cassidy westerns before being cast as Lieutenant John Summers opposite [[Claudette Colbert]] in ''[[So Proudly We Hail!]]'' (1942), a war drama for [[Paramount Pictures]], who signed Reeves up for two films a year.<ref name=CloserOwn/>\n\nHowever, Reeves was inspired by ''So Proudly We Hail!'' to put his budding acting career on hold and enlist in the [[U.S. Army]].<ref name=CloserOwn/> He was drafted in early 1943.<ref>U.S. World War II Army Enlistment Records 1938\u20131946, dated 24 March 1943</ref> He was assigned to the [[U.S. Army Air Forces]] and performed in the USAAF's [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] show ''[[Winged Victory (play)|Winged Victory]]''. The long Broadway run was followed by a national tour and a [[Winged Victory (film)|movie]] version. Reeves was then transferred to the Army Air Forces' [[First Motion Picture Unit]], where he made training films.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nDischarged at the war's end, Reeves returned to Hollywood. However, many studios were slowing down their production schedules, and some production units had shut down completely. He appeared in a pair of outdoor thrillers with [[Ralph Byrd]]. As more and more time passed between lower and lower-paying acting jobs, Reeves was reduced to appearing in a low-budget serial produced by [[Sam Katzman]], ''[[The Adventures of Sir Galahad]]'', and taking a second job digging [[cesspool]]s.<ref name=CloserOwn/> Reeves fit the rugged requirements of the roles and, with his retentive memory for dialogue, he did well under rushed production conditions. He was able to play against type and starred as a villainous gold hunter in a [[Johnny Weissmuller]] [[Jungle Jim]] film. Separated from his wife (their divorce became final in 1950), Reeves moved to [[New York City]] in 1949. He performed on live television anthology programs, as well as on radio, and then returned to Hollywood in 1951 for a role in a [[Fritz Lang]] film, ''[[Rancho Notorious]]''.<ref>\"George Reeves Returns\", ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', April 11, 1951, p. 6</ref>\n\nIn 1953, Reeves played a minor character, Sergeant Maylon Stark, in ''[[From Here To Eternity]]''. The film won the [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], and gave Reeves the distinction of appearing in two \"Best Picture\" films.\n\n===Superman===\n<!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Superman and the Mole Men video capture.JPG|thumb|200px|Reeves and [[Phyllis Coates]] in ''[[Superman and the Mole Men]]'']] -->\nIn June 1951, Reeves was offered the role of [[Superman]] in a new television series<ref>\"Reeves Now Superman\", ''Hollywood Reporter'', June 25, 1951, p. 7.</ref> titled ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]]''. He was initially reluctant to take the role because, like many actors of his time, he considered television unimportant and believed few would see his work. The half-hour films were shot on tight schedules; at least two shows were made every six days. According to commentaries on the ''Adventures of Superman'' DVD sets, multiple scripts would be filmed simultaneously to take advantage of the standing sets so that, for example, all the \"Perry White's office\" scenes for three or four episodes would be shot the same day and the various \"apartment\" scenes would be done consecutively.\n\nReeves's career as Superman had begun with ''[[Superman and the Mole Men]]'', a film intended both as a B-picture and as the pilot for the TV series. Immediately after completing it, Reeves and the crew began production of the first season's episodes, all shot over 13 weeks in the summer of 1951. The series went on the air the following year, and Reeves was amazed at becoming a national celebrity. In 1952, the struggling [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC Network]] purchased the show for national broadcast, which gave him greater visibility.\n\nThe Superman cast members had restrictive contracts which prevented them from taking other work that might interfere with the series. Except for the second season, the Superman schedule was brief (13 shows shot two per week, a total of seven weeks out of a year), but all had a \"30-day clause\", which meant that the producers could demand their exclusive services for a new season on four weeks' notice. This prevented long-term work on major films with long schedules, stage plays which might lead to a lengthy run, or any other series work.<ref name=\"Grossman, page 121\">Grossman, p. 121.</ref>\n\nReeves, however, earned additional income from personal appearances. He had affection for his young fans, and took his role model status seriously.<ref name=CloserOwn/> He avoided cigarettes where children could see him and eventually quit smoking. He kept his private life discreet. Nevertheless, he had a romantic relationship with a married ex-showgirl eight years his senior, [[Toni Mannix]], wife of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] general manager [[Eddie Mannix]].\n\nIn the documentary ''[[Look, Up in the Sky: The Amazing Story of Superman]]'', [[Jack Larson]] described how when he first met Reeves he told him that he enjoyed his performance in ''So Proudly We Hail!'' According to Larson, Reeves said that if Mark Sandrich had not died, he would not be there in \"this monkey suit\".{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} According to Larson, Reeves also said he would feel better about the role if he knew he had any adult fans, and never learned that ''Adventures of Superman'' had adult fans even during its original broadcast run.<ref name=CloserOwn/>\n\nBetween the first and second seasons of ''Superman'', Reeves got sporadic acting assignments in one-shot TV anthology programs and in two feature films, ''[[Forever Female]]'' (1953) and [[Fritz Lang]]'s ''[[The Blue Gardenia]]'' (1953), but by the time the series was airing nationwide, Reeves found himself so [[Typecasting (acting)|associated]] with Superman and Clark Kent that it was difficult for him to find other roles.\n\nReeves worked tirelessly with Toni Mannix to raise money to fight [[myasthenia gravis]]. He served as national chairman for the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation in 1955. During the second season, Reeves appeared in a short film for the Treasury Department entitled ''[[Stamp Day for Superman]]'', in which he caught the villains and told children why they should invest in government [[savings stamp]]s.\n[[File:Stamp Day for Superman.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Screen capture of Reeves as Superman in the U.S. government film ''[[Stamp Day for Superman]]'']]\n\nAfter two seasons, Reeves was dissatisfied with his salary and the show's one-dimensional role. He was 40 years old and wished to quit and move on with his career. The producers looked elsewhere for a new star.<ref>''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', September 27, 1954.</ref>\n\nReeves established his own production company and conceived a TV adventure series called ''Port of Entry'' which would be shot on location in Hawaii and Mexico, writing the pilot script himself. However, ''Superman'' producers offered him a salary increase and he returned to the series.<ref>''Variety'', October 27, 1954.</ref> He was reportedly making $5,000 (about $50,000 in 2018 dollars) per week, but only while the show was in production (about eight weeks each year).<ref name=\"Grossman, page 121\"/> As for ''Port of Entry'', Reeves was never able to gain financing for the project, and the show was never made.\n\nIn 1957, the producers considered a theatrical film ''Superman and the Secret Planet''. A script was commissioned from David Chantler, who had written many of the TV scripts. In 1959, however, negotiations began for a renewal of the series, with 26&nbsp;episodes scheduled to go into production. By mid 1959, contracts were signed, costumes refitted, and new teleplay writers assigned. [[Noel Neill]] was quoted as saying that the cast of ''Superman'' was ready to do a new series of the still-popular show.<ref>''DC Comics: Sixty Years of the World's Favorite Comic Book Heroes,'' no page cited.</ref>\n\nAttempting to showcase his versatility, Reeves sang on the [[Tony Bennett]] show in August 1956.<ref>Grossman, p. 45.</ref> He appeared as Superman on ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' (Episode #165, \"[[Lucy and Superman]]\") in 1957. Character actor [[Ben Welden]] had acted with Reeves in the Warner Bros. days and frequently guest-starred on ''Superman''. He said, \"After the ''I Love Lucy'' show, Superman was no longer a challenge to him.... I know he enjoyed the role, but he used to say, 'Here I am, wasting my life.'\"<ref>Grossman, p. 151.</ref> His good friend [[Bill Walsh (producer)|Bill Walsh]], a producer at [[Disney]] Studios, gave Reeves a prominent role in ''[[Westward Ho the Wagons!]]'' (1956), in which Reeves wore a beard and mustache. It was to be his final feature film appearance.\n\nReeves, Noel Neill, [[Natividad Vac\u00edo]], [[Gene LeBell]], and a trio of musicians toured with a public appearance show from 1957 onward. The first half of the show was a ''Superman'' sketch in which Reeves and Neill performed with LeBell as a villain called \"Mr. [[Kryptonite]]\" who captured Lois Lane. Kent then rushed offstage to return as Superman, who came to the rescue and fought with the bad guy. The second half of the show was Reeves out of costume and as himself, singing and accompanying himself on the guitar. Vacio and Neill accompanied him in duets.<ref>Grossman, p. 54.</ref>\n\nReeves and Toni Mannix split in 1958, and Reeves announced his engagement to society playgirl Leonore Lemmon. Reeves was apparently scheduled to marry Lemmon on June 19 and then spend their honeymoon in Tijuana. He complained to friends, columnists, and his mother of his financial problems. The planned revival of ''Superman'' was apparently a small lifeline. Reeves had also hoped to direct a low-budget science-fiction film written by a friend from his Pasadena Playhouse days, and he had discussed the project with his first Lois Lane, [[Phyllis Coates]], the previous year.<ref>Grossman, p. 58.</ref> However, Reeves and his partner failed to find financing, and the film was never made. Another Superman stage show was scheduled for July<ref>New York Post, June 17, 1959.</ref> with a planned stage tour of [[Australia]]. Reeves had options for making a living, but those options apparently all involved playing Superman again\u2014a role that he was not eager to reprise at age 45.\n\nJack Larson and Noel Neill both remembered Reeves as a noble Southern gentleman (even though he was from Iowa) with a sign on his dressing room door that said \"Honest George, the people's friend\".<ref>''[[Look, Up in the Sky: The Amazing Story of Superman]]''.</ref> Reeves had been made a \"[[Kentucky Colonel]]\" during a publicity trip in the South, and the sign on his dressing room door was replaced with a new one that read \"Honest George, also known as Col. Reeves\", created by the show's prop department. A photo of a smiling Reeves and the sign appears in Gary Grossman's book about the show.\n\n==Death==\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2010}}\nReeves died of a gunshot wound to the head in the upstairs bedroom of his home in [[Benedict Canyon, Los Angeles, California|Benedict Canyon]] between 1:30 and 2:00&nbsp;a.m. on June 16, 1959, according to the Los Angeles Police Department report. The police arrived within the hour. Present in the house at the time of the incident were Leonore Lemmon (Reeves' fianc\u00e9e), William Bliss, writer Robert Condon, and Carol Van Ronkel, who lived a few blocks away with her husband, screenwriter Rip Van Ronkel.\n\nAccording to these witnesses, Lemmon and Reeves had been dining and drinking earlier in the evening in the company of writer Condon, who was [[Ghostwriter|ghostwriting]] an autobiography of prizefighter [[Archie Moore]]. Reeves and Lemmon had an argument at the restaurant in front of Condon, and the three of them returned home. However, Lemmon stated in interviews with Reeves' biographer Jim Beaver that she and Reeves had not accompanied friends to the restaurant but rather to wrestling matches. Contemporaneous news items indicate that Reeves' friend [[Gene LeBell]] was wrestling that night\u2014yet LeBell's own recollections are that he did not see Reeves after a workout session earlier in the day.\n\nSometime near midnight, after Reeves had gone to bed, an impromptu party began when Bliss and Carol Van Ronkel arrived at the Reeves home. Reeves angrily came downstairs and complained about the noise. After blowing off steam, he stayed with the guests for a while, had a drink, and then returned upstairs again in a bad mood. The guests later heard a single gunshot from upstairs. Bliss ran upstairs into Reeves' bedroom and found him lying across the bed dead, his naked body facing upward and his feet on the floor. It is believed that this corroborated Reeves' sitting position on the edge of the bed when he allegedly shot himself, after which his body fell back on the bed and the .30 caliber (7.65\u00d721mm) [[Luger P08 pistol|Luger]] pistol fell between his feet.\n\nStatements made by the witnesses to the police and to the press essentially agree. Neither Leonore Lemmon nor other guests who were at the scene made any apology for their delay in calling the police after hearing the fatal gunshot that killed Reeves; the shock of the death, the lateness of the hour, and their state of intoxication were given as reasons for the delay. Police said that all of the witnesses present were extremely inebriated and that coherent stories were very difficult to obtain from them.\n\nIn contemporary news articles, Lemmon attributed Reeves' alleged suicide to depression caused by his \"failed career\" and inability to find more work. The report made by the Los Angeles Police states, \"[Reeves was]... depressed because he couldn't get the sort of parts he wanted.\" Newspapers and wire-service reports quoted LAPD Sergeant V.A. Peterson as saying: \"Miss Lemmon blurted, 'He's probably going to go shoot himself.' A noise was heard upstairs. She continued, 'He's opening a drawer to get the gun.' A shot was heard. 'See there\u2014I told you so!'\"'<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=EQMdAAAAIBAJ&sjid=7ooEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7331,1693817&dq=george+reeves+lenore+lemmon+i+told+you+so&hl=en|title=Actor Commits Suicide|date=June 17, 1959|work=Sarasota Journal|page=14|accessdate=January 5, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe official story given by Lemmon to the police placed her in the living room with party guests at the time of the shooting, but hearsay statements from Fred Crane, Reeves' friend and colleague from ''Gone With The Wind'', put Lemmon either inside or in direct proximity to Reeves' bedroom.<ref>Speeding Bullet, 2nd Ed, by Jan Alan Henderson, p. 151</ref>  According to Crane (who was not present), Bill Bliss had told Millicent Trent after the shot rang out, while Bliss was having a drink, that Leonore Lemmon came downstairs and said, \u201cTell them I was down here, tell them I was down here!\u201d<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.glasshousepresents.com/Fred_Crane.htm|title=Glass House Presents|publisher=Glass House Presents|accessdate=2010-08-13}}</ref>\n\nA number of questionable physical findings were reported by investigators and others:  No fingerprints were recovered from the gun.  No gunpowder residue was found on Reeves' hands. (Some sources contend that it may not have been looked for, as gunshot residue testing was not routinely performed in 1959.<ref>[http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1556/was-em-superman-em-star-george-reeves-a-suicide-or-murder-victim \"Was Superman star George Reeves a suicide \u2013 or murder victim?\"], StraightDope.com; accessed October 31, 2015.</ref>)  The bullet that killed Reeves was recovered from the bedroom ceiling, and the spent shell casing was found under his body. Two additional bullets were discovered embedded in the bedroom floor.  All three bullets had been fired from the weapon found at Reeves' feet, though all witnesses agreed they heard only one gunshot, and there was no sign of forced entry or other physical evidence that a second person was in the room.<ref name = \"who\"/>  Despite the unanswered questions, Reeves' death was officially ruled a suicide, based on witness statements, physical evidence at the scene, and the autopsy report.<ref>Los Angeles Police Department Death Report, June 26, 1959.</ref>\n\nReeves' mother thought the ruling premature and peremptory, and retained attorney [[Jerry Giesler]] to petition for a reinvestigation of the case as a possible homicide. The findings of a second autopsy, conducted at Giesler's request, were the same as the first, except for a series of bruises of unknown origin about the head and body. A month later, having uncovered no evidence contradicting the official finding, Giesler announced that he was satisfied that the gunshot wound had been self-inflicted, and withdrew.<ref>''Los Angeles Mirror-News'', June 24, 1959</ref><ref name = \"who\">[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/04/14/who-killed-superman-the-sinister-true-story-behind-the-death-of/ Who Killed Superman?] ''The Telegraph'' (March 13, 2016), retrieved August 17, 2016.</ref>\n\nReeves is interred at Mountain View Cemetery and Mausoleum in [[Altadena, California]].

Others suggested that Eddie Mannix\u2014rumored to have mafia ties\u2014ordered Reeves killed.<ref>[http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/2000/12/03/ent_299454.shtml#.WOflWxRGWA0 Death of Superman may not have been a suicide]. ''Augusta Chronicle'' (December 3, 2000), retrieved April 7, 2017.</ref>\n\nThe 2006 film ''[[Hollywoodland]]'', starring [[Ben Affleck]] as Reeves and [[Adrien Brody]] as a fictional investigator loosely based on actual detective Milo Speriglio, dramatizes the investigation of Reeves' death. The film suggests three possible scenarios: accidental shooting by Lemmon, murder by an unnamed hitman under orders from Eddie Mannix, and suicide.\n\nToni Mannix suffered from [[Alzheimer's disease]] for years and died in 1983. In 1999, Los Angeles publicist [[Edward Lozzi]] said that Toni Mannix had confessed to a Catholic priest in Lozzi's presence that she was responsible for having Reeves killed. (This was following the resurrection of the Reeves case by TV shows ''[[Unsolved Mysteries]]'' and ''[[Mysteries and Scandals]]''.) Lozzi made the statement on TV tabloid shows, including ''[[Extra (U.S. TV program)|Extra]]'', ''[[Inside Edition]]'', and ''[[Court TV]]''. In the wake of ''Hollywoodland''{{'}}s publicity in 2006, Lozzi repeated his story to the tabloid ''The Globe'' and to the ''Los Angeles Times'', where the statement was disputed by Jack Larson. Larson stated that facts which he knew from his close friendship with Toni Mannix precluded Lozzi's story from being true. According to Lozzi, he lived with and then visited the elderly Mannix from 1979 to 1982 and on at least a half-dozen occasions he called a priest when Mrs. Mannix feared death and wanted to confess her sins. Mannix suffered from Alzheimer's disease and senile dementia, but Lozzi says that her confession was made during a period of lucidity in Mannix's home before she was moved from her house to a hospital. Mannix lived in a hospital suite for the last several years of her life, having donated a large portion of her estate to the hospital in exchange for perpetual care. Lozzi also told of Tuesday night prayer sessions that Toni Mannix conducted with him and others at an altar shrine to Reeves that she had built in her home. Lozzi stated \"During these prayer sessions, she prayed loudly and trance-like to Reeves and God, and without confessing yet, asked them for forgiveness.\" Lozzi's statement, however, is not supported by independent evidence.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\n==Filmography==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=90%\n|+Film\n|-\n! width=3%|Year\n! width=18%|Title\n! width=22%|Role\n! class=\"unsortable\" width=20%| Notes\n|-\n| 1939\n| ''[[Espionage Agent]]''\n| Warrington's secretary\n| Uncredited\n|-\n| 1939\n| ''[[On Dress Parade]]''\n| Southern soldier in trench\n| Uncredited\n|-\n| 1939\n| ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''\n| Stuart Tarleton&nbsp;\u2013 Scarlett's beau\n| Credited erroneously onscreen as playing Brent Tarleton (see above)\n|-\n| 1940\n| ''{{sortname|The|Fighting 69th}}''\n| Jack O'Keefe\n| Uncredited\n|-\n| 1940\n| ''[[Father Is a Prince]]''\n| Gary Lee\n|\n|-\n| 1940\n| ''[[Virginia City (film)|Virginia City]]''\n| Major Drewery's telegrapher\n| Uncredited\n|-\n| 1940\n| ''[[Tear Gas Squad]]''\n| Joe McCabe\n|\n|-\n| 1940\n| ''Pony Express Days''\n| William F.

Reeves was born five months into their marriage<ref>Fox, Alma Archer. \"My Cousin Superman\", ''Galesburg Register-Mail'', June 15, 1979.</ref> and the couple separated soon after Reeves's birth.

There she met and married Frank Joseph Bessolo while Reeves's father married Helen Schultz in 1925. Reeves reportedly never saw his father again. In 1927, Frank Bessolo adopted George as his own son, and the boy took on his stepfather's last name, becoming '''George Bessolo'''.<ref name=\"Superman Homepage\">{{cite web|url=http://www.supermanhomepage.com/tv/tv.php?topic=cast-crew/george-reeves|title=Superman Homepage|accessdate=June 16, 2007}}</ref> The Bessolo marriage lasted 15 years, ending in divorce, with the couple separating while Reeves was away visiting relatives. When he returned, his mother told him his stepfather had committed suicide.\n\nAccording to biographer [[Jim Beaver]], Reeves did not know for several years that Bessolo was still alive. Reeves began acting and singing in high school and continued performing on stage as a student at [[Pasadena Junior College]].<ref>''Pasadena Junior College Courier'', 1934</ref>\n\n==Acting career==\nWhile studying acting at the [[Pasadena Playhouse]], Reeves met his future wife, Ellanora Needles. They married on September 22, 1940, in [[San Gabriel, California]], at the Church of Our Savior. They had no children and divorced 10 years later.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nReeves's film career began in 1939 when he was cast as Stuart Tarleton (incorrectly listed in the film's credits as Brent Tarleton), one of [[Scarlett O'Hara]]'s suitors in ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''. It was a minor role, but he and [[Fred Crane (actor)|Fred Crane]] were in the film's opening scene. (Reeves and Crane both dyed their hair red to portray the Tarleton twins.) After ''Gone with the Wind'' was filmed, Reeves returned to the Pasadena Playhouse and was given the lead role in the play ''Poncho''. This part directly led to him being contracted to [[Warner Brothers]].<ref name=CloserOwn>{{cite web |last=Gross |first=Ed |title=The Life and Tragic Death of \u2018Superman\u2019 Star George Reeves \u2014 Plus the Actor in his Own Words |url=https://www.supermanhomepage.com/tv/tv.php?topic=cast-crew/george-reeves |website=[[Closer (magazine)|Closer]] |accessdate=26 December 2019 |date=October 28, 2019}}</ref> Warner changed his professional name to George Reeves.<ref name=\"Superman Homepage\"/> His ''Gone with the Wind'' screen credit reflects the change. Between the start of ''Gone With the Wind'' production and its release 12 months later, several films on his Warner contract were made and released, making ''Gone With the Wind'' his first film role, but his fifth film release.\n\nHe starred in a number of two-reel short subjects and appeared in several B-pictures, including two with [[Ronald Reagan]] and three with [[James Cagney]] (''[[Torrid Zone]]'', ''[[The Fighting 69th]]'', and ''[[The Strawberry Blonde]]''). These roles did little to advance Reeves' career, and his contract with Warners was dissolved by mutual consent.<ref name=CloserOwn/>\n\nReleased from his Warner contract, he signed a contract at [[Twentieth Century-Fox]], but was released after only a handful of films, one of which was the [[Charlie Chan]] movie ''[[Dead Men Tell]]''. Twentieth Century-Fox loaned him to producer [[Alexander Korda]] to co-star with [[Merle Oberon]] in ''[[Lydia (film)|Lydia]]'',<ref name=CloserOwn/> a box-office failure. He freelanced, looking to find work in westerns.<ref name=CloserOwn/> His friend [[Teddi Sherman]] introduced him to her producer father [[Harry Sherman]], who asked Reeves to do a [[screen test]] with Teddi for the [[Hopalong Cassidy]] films. Reeves and Sherman impressed the casting director by performing seven pages of script without pause in a single take.<ref name=CloserOwn/> Reeves appeared in five Hopalong Cassidy westerns before being cast as Lieutenant John Summers opposite [[Claudette Colbert]] in ''[[So Proudly We Hail!]]'' (1942), a war drama for [[Paramount Pictures]], who signed Reeves up for two films a year.<ref name=CloserOwn/>\n\nHowever, Reeves was inspired by ''So Proudly We Hail!'' to put his budding acting career on hold and enlist in the [[U.S. Army]].<ref name=CloserOwn/> He was drafted in early 1943.<ref>U.S. World War II Army Enlistment Records 1938\u20131946, dated 24 March 1943</ref> He was assigned to the [[U.S. Army Air Forces]] and performed in the USAAF's [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] show ''[[Winged Victory (play)|Winged Victory]]''. The long Broadway run was followed by a national tour and a [[Winged Victory (film)|movie]] version. Reeves was then transferred to the Army Air Forces' [[First Motion Picture Unit]], where he made training films.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nDischarged at the war's end, Reeves returned to Hollywood. However, many studios were slowing down their production schedules, and some production units had shut down completely. He appeared in a pair of outdoor thrillers with [[Ralph Byrd]]. As more and more time passed between lower and lower-paying acting jobs, Reeves was reduced to appearing in a low-budget serial produced by [[Sam Katzman]], ''[[The Adventures of Sir Galahad]]'', and taking a second job digging [[cesspool]]s.<ref name=CloserOwn/> Reeves fit the rugged requirements of the roles and, with his retentive memory for dialogue, he did well under rushed production conditions. He was able to play against type and starred as a villainous gold hunter in a [[Johnny Weissmuller]] [[Jungle Jim]] film. Separated from his wife (their divorce became final in 1950), Reeves moved to [[New York City]] in 1949. He performed on live television anthology programs, as well as on radio, and then returned to Hollywood in 1951 for a role in a [[Fritz Lang]] film, ''[[Rancho Notorious]]''.<ref>\"George Reeves Returns\", ''[[Hollywood Reporter]]'', April 11, 1951, p. 6</ref>\n\nIn 1953, Reeves played a minor character, Sergeant Maylon Stark, in ''[[From Here To Eternity]]''. The film won the [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], and gave Reeves the distinction of appearing in two \"Best Picture\" films.\n\n===Superman===\n<!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Superman and the Mole Men video capture.JPG|thumb|200px|Reeves and [[Phyllis Coates]] in ''[[Superman and the Mole Men]]'']] -->\nIn June 1951, Reeves was offered the role of [[Superman]] in a new television series<ref>\"Reeves Now Superman\", ''Hollywood Reporter'', June 25, 1951, p. 7.</ref> titled ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]]''. He was initially reluctant to take the role because, like many actors of his time, he considered television unimportant and believed few would see his work. The half-hour films were shot on tight schedules; at least two shows were made every six days. According to commentaries on the ''Adventures of Superman'' DVD sets, multiple scripts would be filmed simultaneously to take advantage of the standing sets so that, for example, all the \"Perry White's office\" scenes for three or four episodes would be shot the same day and the various \"apartment\" scenes would be done consecutively.\n\nReeves's career as Superman had begun with ''[[Superman and the Mole Men]]'', a film intended both as a B-picture and as the pilot for the TV series. Immediately after completing it, Reeves and the crew began production of the first season's episodes, all shot over 13 weeks in the summer of 1951. The series went on the air the following year, and Reeves was amazed at becoming a national celebrity. In 1952, the struggling [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC Network]] purchased the show for national broadcast, which gave him greater visibility.\n\nThe Superman cast members had restrictive contracts which prevented them from taking other work that might interfere with the series. Except for the second season, the Superman schedule was brief (13 shows shot two per week, a total of seven weeks out of a year), but all had a \"30-day clause\", which meant that the producers could demand their exclusive services for a new season on four weeks' notice. This prevented long-term work on major films with long schedules, stage plays which might lead to a lengthy run, or any other series work.<ref name=\"Grossman, page 121\">Grossman, p. 121.</ref>\n\nReeves, however, earned additional income from personal appearances. He had affection for his young fans, and took his role model status seriously.<ref name=CloserOwn/> He avoided cigarettes where children could see him and eventually quit smoking. He kept his private life discreet. Nevertheless, he had a romantic relationship with a married ex-showgirl eight years his senior, [[Toni Mannix]], wife of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] general manager [[Eddie Mannix]].\n\nIn the documentary ''[[Look, Up in the Sky: The Amazing Story of Superman]]'', [[Jack Larson]] described how when he first met Reeves he told him that he enjoyed his performance in ''So Proudly We Hail!'' According to Larson, Reeves said that if Mark Sandrich had not died, he would not be there in \"this monkey suit\".{{cn|date=December 2019}} According to Larson, Reeves also said he would feel better about the role if he knew he had any adult fans, and never learned that ''Adventures of Superman'' had adult fans even during its original broadcast run.<ref name=CloserOwn/>\n\nBetween the first and second seasons of ''Superman'', Reeves got sporadic acting assignments in one-shot TV anthology programs and in two feature films, ''[[Forever Female]]'' (1953) and [[Fritz Lang]]'s ''[[The Blue Gardenia]]'' (1953), but by the time the series was airing nationwide, Reeves found himself so [[Typecasting (acting)|associated]] with Superman and Clark Kent that it was difficult for him to find other roles.\n\nReeves worked tirelessly with Toni Mannix to raise money to fight [[myasthenia gravis]]. He served as national chairman for the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation in 1955. During the second season, Reeves appeared in a short film for the Treasury Department entitled ''[[Stamp Day for Superman]]'', in which he caught the villains and told children why they should invest in government [[savings stamp]]s.\n[[File:Stamp Day for Superman.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Screen capture of Reeves as Superman in the U.S. government film ''[[Stamp Day for Superman]]'']]\n\nAfter two seasons, Reeves was dissatisfied with his salary and the show's one-dimensional role. He was 40 years old and wished to quit and move on with his career. The producers looked elsewhere for a new star.<ref>''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', September 27, 1954.</ref>\n\nReeves established his own production company and conceived a TV adventure series called ''Port of Entry'' which would be shot on location in Hawaii and Mexico, writing the pilot script himself. However, ''Superman'' producers offered him a salary increase and he returned to the series.<ref>''Variety'', October 27, 1954.</ref> He was reportedly making $5,000 (about $50,000 in 2018 dollars) per week, but only while the show was in production (about eight weeks each year).<ref name=\"Grossman, page 121\"/> As for ''Port of Entry'', Reeves was never able to gain financing for the project, and the show was never made.\n\nIn 1957, the producers considered a theatrical film ''Superman and the Secret Planet''. A script was commissioned from David Chantler, who had written many of the TV scripts. In 1959, however, negotiations began for a renewal of the series, with 26&nbsp;episodes scheduled to go into production. By mid 1959, contracts were signed, costumes refitted, and new teleplay writers assigned. [[Noel Neill]] was quoted as saying that the cast of ''Superman'' was ready to do a new series of the still-popular show.<ref>''DC Comics: Sixty Years of the World's Favorite Comic Book Heroes,'' no page cited.</ref>\n\nAttempting to showcase his versatility, Reeves sang on the [[Tony Bennett]] show in August 1956.<ref>Grossman, p. 45.</ref> He appeared as Superman on ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' (Episode #165, \"[[Lucy and Superman]]\") in 1957. Character actor [[Ben Welden]] had acted with Reeves in the Warner Bros. days and frequently guest-starred on ''Superman''. He said, \"After the ''I Love Lucy'' show, Superman was no longer a challenge to him.... I know he enjoyed the role, but he used to say, 'Here I am, wasting my life.'\"<ref>Grossman, p. 151.</ref> His good friend [[Bill Walsh (producer)|Bill Walsh]], a producer at [[Disney]] Studios, gave Reeves a prominent role in ''[[Westward Ho the Wagons!]]'' (1956), in which Reeves wore a beard and mustache. It was to be his final feature film appearance.\n\nReeves, Noel Neill, [[Natividad Vac\u00edo]], [[Gene LeBell]], and a trio of musicians toured with a public appearance show from 1957 onward. The first half of the show was a ''Superman'' sketch in which Reeves and Neill performed with LeBell as a villain called \"Mr. [[Kryptonite]]\" who captured Lois Lane. Kent then rushed offstage to return as Superman, who came to the rescue and fought with the bad guy. The second half of the show was Reeves out of costume and as himself, singing and accompanying himself on the guitar. Vacio and Neill accompanied him in duets.<ref>Grossman, p. 54.</ref>\n\nReeves and Toni Mannix split in 1958, and Reeves announced his engagement to society playgirl Leonore Lemmon. Reeves was apparently scheduled to marry Lemmon on June 19 and then spend their honeymoon in Tijuana. He complained to friends, columnists, and his mother of his financial problems. The planned revival of ''Superman'' was apparently a small lifeline. Reeves had also hoped to direct a low-budget science-fiction film written by a friend from his Pasadena Playhouse days, and he had discussed the project with his first Lois Lane, [[Phyllis Coates]], the previous year.<ref>Grossman, p. 58.</ref> However, Reeves and his partner failed to find financing, and the film was never made. Another Superman stage show was scheduled for July<ref>New York Post, June 17, 1959.</ref> with a planned stage tour of [[Australia]]. Reeves had options for making a living, but those options apparently all involved playing Superman again\u2014a role that he was not eager to reprise at age 45.\n\nJack Larson and Noel Neill both remembered Reeves as a noble Southern gentleman (even though he was from Iowa) with a sign on his dressing room door that said \"Honest George, the people's friend\".<ref>''[[Look, Up in the Sky: The Amazing Story of Superman]]''.</ref> Reeves had been made a \"[[Kentucky Colonel]]\" during a publicity trip in the South, and the sign on his dressing room door was replaced with a new one that read \"Honest George, also known as Col. Reeves\", created by the show's prop department. A photo of a smiling Reeves and the sign appears in Gary Grossman's book about the show.\n\n==Death==\n{{refimprove section|date=May 2010}}\nReeves died of a gunshot wound to the head in the upstairs bedroom of his home in [[Benedict Canyon, Los Angeles, California|Benedict Canyon]] between 1:30 and 2:00&nbsp;a.m. on June 16, 1959, according to the Los Angeles Police Department report. The police arrived within the hour. Present in the house at the time of the incident were Leonore Lemmon (Reeves' fianc\u00e9e), William Bliss, writer Robert Condon, and Carol Van Ronkel, who lived a few blocks away with her husband, screenwriter Rip Van Ronkel.\n\nAccording to these witnesses, Lemmon and Reeves had been dining and drinking earlier in the evening in the company of writer Condon, who was [[Ghostwriter|ghostwriting]] an autobiography of prizefighter [[Archie Moore]]. Reeves and Lemmon had an argument at the restaurant in front of Condon, and the three of them returned home. However, Lemmon stated in interviews with Reeves' biographer Jim Beaver that she and Reeves had not accompanied friends to the restaurant but rather to wrestling matches. Contemporaneous news items indicate that Reeves' friend [[Gene LeBell]] was wrestling that night\u2014yet LeBell's own recollections are that he did not see Reeves after a workout session earlier in the day.\n\nSometime near midnight, after Reeves had gone to bed, an impromptu party began when Bliss and Carol Van Ronkel arrived at the Reeves home. Reeves angrily came downstairs and complained about the noise. After blowing off steam, he stayed with the guests for a while, had a drink, and then returned upstairs again in a bad mood. The guests later heard a single gunshot from upstairs. Bliss ran upstairs into Reeves' bedroom and found him lying across the bed dead, his naked body facing upward and his feet on the floor. It is believed that this corroborated Reeves' sitting position on the edge of the bed when he allegedly shot himself, after which his body fell back on the bed and the .30 caliber (7.65\u00d721mm) [[Luger P08 pistol|Luger]] pistol fell between his feet.\n\nStatements made by the witnesses to the police and to the press essentially agree. Neither Leonore Lemmon nor other guests who were at the scene made any apology for their delay in calling the police after hearing the fatal gunshot that killed Reeves; the shock of the death, the lateness of the hour, and their state of intoxication were given as reasons for the delay. Police said that all of the witnesses present were extremely inebriated and that coherent stories were very difficult to obtain from them.\n\nIn contemporary news articles, Lemmon attributed Reeves' alleged suicide to depression caused by his \"failed career\" and inability to find more work. The report made by the Los Angeles Police states, \"[Reeves was]... depressed because he couldn't get the sort of parts he wanted.\" Newspapers and wire-service reports quoted LAPD Sergeant V.A. Peterson as saying: \"Miss Lemmon blurted, 'He's probably going to go shoot himself.' A noise was heard upstairs. She continued, 'He's opening a drawer to get the gun.' A shot was heard. 'See there\u2014I told you so!'\"'<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=EQMdAAAAIBAJ&sjid=7ooEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7331,1693817&dq=george+reeves+lenore+lemmon+i+told+you+so&hl=en|title=Actor Commits Suicide|date=June 17, 1959|work=Sarasota Journal|page=14|accessdate=January 5, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe official story given by Lemmon to the police placed her in the living room with party guests at the time of the shooting, but hearsay statements from Fred Crane, Reeves' friend and colleague from ''Gone With The Wind'', put Lemmon either inside or in direct proximity to Reeves' bedroom.<ref>Speeding Bullet, 2nd Ed, by Jan Alan Henderson, p. 151</ref>  According to Crane (who was not present), Bill Bliss had told Millicent Trent after the shot rang out, while Bliss was having a drink, that Leonore Lemmon came downstairs and said, \u201cTell them I was down here, tell them I was down here!\u201d<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.glasshousepresents.com/Fred_Crane.htm|title=Glass House Presents|publisher=Glass House Presents|accessdate=2010-08-13}}</ref>\n\nA number of questionable physical findings were reported by investigators and others:  No fingerprints were recovered from the gun.  No gunpowder residue was found on Reeves' hands. (Some sources contend that it may not have been looked for, as gunshot residue testing was not routinely performed in 1959.<ref>[http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1556/was-em-superman-em-star-george-reeves-a-suicide-or-murder-victim \"Was Superman star George Reeves a suicide \u2013 or murder victim?\"], StraightDope.com; accessed October 31, 2015.</ref>)  The bullet that killed Reeves was recovered from the bedroom ceiling, and the spent shell casing was found under his body. Two additional bullets were discovered embedded in the bedroom floor.  All three bullets had been fired from the weapon found at Reeves' feet, though all witnesses agreed they heard only one gunshot, and there was no sign of forced entry or other physical evidence that a second person was in the room.<ref name = \"who\"/>  Despite the unanswered questions, Reeves' death was officially ruled a suicide, based on witness statements, physical evidence at the scene, and the autopsy report.<ref>Los Angeles Police Department Death Report, June 26, 1959.</ref>\n\nReeves' mother thought the ruling premature and peremptory, and retained attorney [[Jerry Giesler]] to petition for a reinvestigation of the case as a possible homicide. The findings of a second autopsy, conducted at Giesler's request, were the same as the first, except for a series of bruises of unknown origin about the head and body. A month later, having uncovered no evidence contradicting the official finding, Giesler announced that he was satisfied that the gunshot wound had been self-inflicted, and withdrew.<ref>''Los Angeles Mirror-News'', June 24, 1959</ref><ref name = \"who\">[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/04/14/who-killed-superman-the-sinister-true-story-behind-the-death-of/ Who Killed Superman?] ''The Telegraph'' (March 13, 2016), retrieved August 17, 2016.</ref>\n\nReeves is interred at Mountain View Cemetery and Mausoleum in [[Altadena, California]]. His scheduled performance for Kennywood Amusement Park was replaced by [[Guy Williams (actor)|Guy Williams]] as Zorro.

Reeves' friend [[Rory Calhoun]] told a reporter \"No one in Hollywood believed the suicide story.\" In their book ''Hollywood Kryptonite'', Sam Kashner and Nancy Schoenberger make a case for the involvement of [[Toni Mannix]], the wife of MGM vice president and fixer [[Eddie Mannix]], with whom Reeves had been having an affair. Others suggested that Eddie Mannix\u2014rumored to have mafia ties\u2014ordered Reeves killed.<ref>[http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/2000/12/03/ent_299454.shtml#.WOflWxRGWA0 Death of Superman may not have been a suicide]. ''Augusta Chronicle'' (December 3, 2000), retrieved April 7, 2017.</ref>\n\nThe 2006 film ''[[Hollywoodland]]'', starring [[Ben Affleck]] as Reeves and [[Adrien Brody]] as a fictional investigator loosely based on actual detective Milo Speriglio, dramatizes the investigation of Reeves' death. The film suggests three possible scenarios: accidental shooting by Lemmon, murder by an unnamed hitman under orders from Eddie Mannix, and suicide.\n\nToni Mannix suffered from [[Alzheimer's disease]] for years and died in 1983. In 1999, Los Angeles publicist [[Edward Lozzi]] said that Toni Mannix had confessed to a Catholic priest in Lozzi's presence that she was responsible for having Reeves killed. (This was following the resurrection of the Reeves case by TV shows ''[[Unsolved Mysteries]]'' and ''[[Mysteries and Scandals]]''.) Lozzi made the statement on TV tabloid shows, including ''[[Extra (U.S. TV program)|Extra]]'', ''[[Inside Edition]]'', and ''[[Court TV]]''. In the wake of ''Hollywoodland''{{'}}s publicity in 2006, Lozzi repeated his story to the tabloid ''The Globe'' and to the ''Los Angeles Times'', where the statement was disputed by Jack Larson. Larson stated that facts which he knew from his close friendship with Toni Mannix precluded Lozzi's story from being true. According to Lozzi, he lived with and then visited the elderly Mannix from 1979 to 1982 and on at least a half-dozen occasions he called a priest when Mrs. Mannix feared death and wanted to confess her sins. Mannix suffered from Alzheimer's disease and senile dementia, but Lozzi says that her confession was made during a period of lucidity in Mannix's home before she was moved from her house to a hospital. Mannix lived in a hospital suite for the last several years of her life, having donated a large portion of her estate to the hospital in exchange for perpetual care. Lozzi also told of Tuesday night prayer sessions that Toni Mannix conducted with him and others at an altar shrine to Reeves that she had built in her home. Lozzi stated \"During these prayer sessions, she prayed loudly and trance-like to Reeves and God, and without confessing yet, asked them for forgiveness.\" Lozzi's statement, however, is not supported by independent evidence.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\n==Filmography==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=90%\n|+Film\n|-\n! width=3%|Year\n! width=18%|Title\n! width=22%|Role\n! class=\"unsortable\" width=20%| Notes\n|-\n| 1939\n| ''[[Espionage Agent]]''\n| Warrington's secretary\n| Uncredited\n|-\n| 1939\n| ''[[On Dress Parade]]''\n| Southern soldier in trench\n| Uncredited\n|-\n| 1939\n| ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''\n| Stuart Tarleton&nbsp;\u2013 Scarlett's beau\n| Credited erroneously onscreen as playing Brent Tarleton (see above)\n|-\n| 1940\n| ''{{sortname|The|Fighting 69th}}''\n| Jack O'Keefe\n| Uncredited\n|-\n| 1940\n| ''[[Father Is a Prince]]''\n| Gary Lee\n|\n|-\n| 1940\n| ''[[Virginia City (film)|Virginia City]]''\n| Major Drewery's telegrapher\n| Uncredited\n|-\n| 1940\n| ''[[Tear Gas Squad]]''\n| Joe McCabe\n|\n|-\n| 1940\n| ''Pony Express Days''\n| William F.

First of all, their reduced squad meant that they omitted Gilberto Quinteros and Miguel Gonz\u00e1lez.

Once they arrived, there was more trouble. [[Adidas]] sent four white and three blue uniforms for each player, but only three white and one blue arrived. The remaining uniforms were said to have been taken away by the association.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} They decided to play with the white uniform and keep the blue as a keepsake. Next, someone stole the balls that the team needed to train with. The day before the match against Hungary, the Hungarians had the 25 balls the organization had given them while El Salvador had none and were unable to train.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} To make things even worse, El Salvador had never seen Hungary play, and the only knowledge that they had about the team was an outdated video that they had bought.{{cn|date=April 2020}} On the field there were more problems. Hungary's fourth goal was caused by [[Jos\u00e9 Francisco Jovel|Francisco Jovel]]'s sudden deafness after he had received a heavy blow on the cheek. When Guevara Mora called to him to stop a ball, the defender did not hear him, and the ball went past Jovel in front of the net.{{cn|date=April 2020}} After the match, the Salvadoran squad had a tense meeting with the coaching staff and Federation.

The national team's first match was played in September 1921, when they were invited to participate in [[Independence Centenary Games|a tournament]] to celebrate 100 years of [[Central American declarations of independence|Central American Independence]].\n\nEl Salvador has made two [[FIFA World Cup]] appearances: first in [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970]] and again in [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982]], but have never progressed beyond the first stage of a finals tournament.

At the end of the tournament, El Salvador and Guatemala ended up with the same number of points and so had to play a tiebreaker. On December 21, Guatemala failed to show up for the match resulting in El Salvador declaring themselves 1943 CCCF Championship winners by goal difference. This was the country's first international title. El Salvador's 10\u20121 set the team's record for the most goals scored in a single game yet . It was also the second time a Salvadoran player (Miguel \"Americano\" Cruz) had scored five goals in a single match.<ref name=\"CCCF 1943\"/> El Salvador defended their title in the [[1946 CCCF Championship]], hosted in [[Costa Rica]], alongside six other participants.

Reasons for these refusals are unknown but might be due to the cost of travel, since at that time the team had never played so far from home.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} During these years El Salvador had a good squad, with players like goalkeeper Manuel \"Tamal\u00f3n\" Garay, Rafael \"Chapuda\" Reyes, Conrado Miranda, Miguel \"Americano\" Cruz, Rafael Corado and Mando Rivas.\n\nIn the group stage of the [[Football at the 1950 Central American and Caribbean Games|1950 Central American and Caribbean Games]] in Mexico, El Salvador recorded two wins, one tie, and one loss.

The remaining uniforms were said to have been taken away by the association.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} They decided to play with the white uniform and keep the blue as a keepsake.

The day before the match against Hungary, the Hungarians had the 25 balls the organization had given them while El Salvador had none and were unable to train.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} To make things even worse, El Salvador had never seen Hungary play, and the only knowledge that they had about the team was an outdated video that they had bought.{{cn|date=April 2020}} On the field there were more problems. Hungary's fourth goal was caused by [[Jos\u00e9 Francisco Jovel|Francisco Jovel]]'s sudden deafness after he had received a heavy blow on the cheek.
