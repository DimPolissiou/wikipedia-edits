This is based on a dedication in the book identifying as ''frater'' (brother) [[Wulfad]], who was made a bishop in 866, making it unlikely that Eriugena would have used so casual a reference after that elevation. The work was not widely circulated in the author's lifetime. Eriugena was assisted by one, possibly two other persons in writing the book, based on the presence of margin notes indicating the penmanship of two separate persons.

The original plan was to devote one book to each of the four divisions, but the topic of creation required expansion. The form of exposition is that of [[dialogue]]; the method of reasoning is the [[syllogism]]. ''Natura'' is the name for the universal, the totality of all things, containing in itself [[being|being and non-being]]. It is the unity of which all special phenomena are manifestations.<blockquote>Eriugena develops a Neoplatonic cosmology according to which the infinite, transcendent and 'unknown' God, who is beyond being and non-being, through a process of self-articulation, procession, or 'self-creation', proceeds from his divine 'darkness' or 'non-being' into the light of being, speaking the Word who is understood as Christ, and at the same timeless moment bringing forth the Primary Causes of all creation... He treats of the essentially dialectical relation between Creator and created, where God expresses Himself in creation and creation culminates in return to the divine.<ref name=Moran>[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scottus-eriugena/ Moran, Dermot, \"John Scottus Eriugena\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy  (Fall 2008 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)]</ref></blockquote>\nOf this nature there are four distinct species:\n\n#That which creates and is not created -this is God, the Source and Principle of all things;\n#That which is created and creates -this is the world of primordial causes or (Platonic) ideas;\n#That which is created and does not create\u2014 this is the world of phenomena, the world of contingent, sense-perceived things;\n#That which neither is created nor creates \u2014 this is God, the Term to which all things are returning.<ref name=Moran/>\n\nThe first is [[God]] as the ground or origin of all things. The \"creation\" of the world is in reality a ''theophania'', or showing forth of the Essence of God in the things created. Just as He reveals Himself to the mind and the soul in higher intellectual and spiritual truth, so He reveals Himself to the senses in the created world around us. Creation is, therefore, a process of unfolding of the Divine Nature. Nature in the second sense, is the world of primordial causes, or ideas, which the Father \"created\" in the Son, and which in turn \"create\", that is determine the generic and specific natures of concrete visible things. Since they are, though created, identical with God, and since their locus is the Word of God, the Second Person of the Blessed Trinity, they are operative causes and not merely static types. From this, however, it is not necessary to infer, as some critics have done, that according to Eriugena the primordial causes are identical with the Word. As examples of primordial causes Eriugena enumerates goodness, wisdom, intuition (insight), understanding, virtue, greatness, power, etc.<ref name=Turner>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05519a.htm  Turner, William. \"John Scotus Eriugena.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 5. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 30 June 2019{{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\nThe third sense, \"which is created and does not create\", is where the stream of reality, setting out from the centre, God, passing through the ideas in the Word, and enters the realm of space and time. Here they are no longer pure ideas but only the appearances of reality, that is phenomena. In the realm of space and time the ideas take on the burden of matter and become subject to multiplicity, change, imperfection, and decay. The material world, therefore, of our experience is composed of ideas clothed in matter \u2014 here Eriugena attempts a reconciliation of Platonism with Aristotelean notions. The last is God as the final end or goal of all things, that into which the world of created things ultimately returns. The return to God proceeds in the inverse order through all the steps which marked the downward course, or process of things from God. The elements become light, light becomes life, life becomes sense, sense becomes reason, reason becomes intellect, intellect becomes ideas in Christ, the Word of God, and through Christ returns to the oneness of God from which all the processes of nature began. This \"incorporation\" in Christ takes place by means of Divine grace in the Church, of which Christ is the invisible head.\n\nThus we distinguish in the divine system beginning, middle and end; but these three are in essence one; the difference is only the consequence of our finite comprehension. We are compelled to envisage this eternal process under the form of time, to apply temporal distinctions to that which is extra- or supra-temporal.\n\n==Commentary== \nFrench journalist and author [[:fr:Jean-Jacques Gabut|Jean-Jacques Gabut]], says \"Moreover, a certain [[pantheism]], or rather ''[[pandeism]]'', emerges from his work where Neo-Platonic inspiration perfectly complements the strict Christian orthodoxy.\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=50FDDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT23&dq=pand%C3%A9isme&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiByZ3owbveAhULxVkKHQRbBscQ6AEINTAC#v=onepage&q=pand%C3%A9isme&f=false Gabut, Jean-Jacques. ''Origines et fondements spirituels et sociologiques de la ma\u00e7onnerie \u00e9cossaise''], 2017</ref> According to [[William Turner (bishop of Buffalo)|William Turner]], professor of Philosophy at [[Catholic University of America]], the doctrine of the final return of all things to God shows very clearly the influence of Origen. In general, the system of thought outlined is a combination of neo-Platonic mysticism, emanationism, and pantheism which Eriugena strove in vain to reconcile with Aristotelean empiricism, Christian creationism, and theism. \"The result is a body of doctrines loosely articulated, in which the mystic and idealistic elements predominate, and in which there is much that is irreconcilable with Catholic dogma.\"<ref name=Turner/>\n\nEriugena himself denied explicitly that he was a pantheist. \"God is all in all. All things that are in God, even are God, are eternal...the creature subsists in God, and God is created in the creature in a wonderful and ineffable way, making himself manifest, invisible making himself visible...But the divine nature, he finally insists, because it is above being, is different from what it create within itself.\"<ref>O'Meara, John J., \"Introduction\", ''The Mind of Eriugena'', (John J. O'Meara and Ludwig Bieler, eds.), Dublin: Irish University Press 1973.</ref> Although Eriugena asserts the identity of God and creation, he explicitly rejects the view that God is the 'genus' or 'whole' (totum) of which the creatures are 'species' or 'parts'. Only metaphorically can it be said that God is a 'genus' or a 'whole'. Assertions concerning the immanence of God in creation are always balanced in Eriugena's writings by assertions of God's transcendence above all things.\"<ref name=Moran/> \n\n''De divisione naturae'' was condemned by a [[council at Sens]] by [[Honorius III]] (1225), for promoting the identity of God and creation, and by [[Pope]] [[Gregory XIII]] in 1585. In 1681, the long-lost work was found at [[Oxford University]], and was immediately placed on the '[[Index of Forbidden Books]]', a turn of events which likely actually spurred its popularity. Despite this result, Turner noted of Eriugena that \"there can be no doubt that he himself abhorred heresy, was disposed to treat the heretic with no small degree of harshness..., and all through his life believed himself an unswervingly loyal son of the Church.\"<ref name=Turner/>\n\n==Legacy==\n''The Division of Nature'' has been called the final achievement of ancient philosophy, a work which \"synthesizes the philosophical accomplishments of fifteen centuries and appears as the final achievement of ancient philosophy.\"<ref>Burch, George. ''Early Medieval Philosophy'', Kings Crown Press. 1951</ref> It is presented, like [[Alcuin]]'s book, as a dialogue between Master and Pupil. Eriugena anticipates [[Thomas Aquinas]], who said that one cannot know and believe a thing at the same time. Eriugena explains that reason is necessary to understand and interpret revelation. \"Authority is the source of knowledge\", but the reason of mankind is the norm by which all authority is judged.<ref name=eriugena/>\n\n== See also ==\n[[Conformal cyclic cosmology|Conformal Cyclic cosmology]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{catholic|title=John Scotus Eriugena}}\n*{{cite SEP |url-id=scottus-eriugena |title=John Scottus Eriugena |last=Moran |first=Dermot}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=RRb5DpHEgaoC&dq=De+divisione+naturae&source=gbs_navlinks_s Digitized Latin version on Google Books]\n*[https://www.ontology.co/eriugena-two.htm Eriugena, ''Periphyseon'' Book I: Aristotelian Logic and Categories]\n*[https://www.ontology.co/biblio/eriugena-editions.htm Complete List of the Editions and Translations of the Works of Eriugena]\n*[https://www.ontology.co/biblio/eriugena-biblio-one.htm Annotated bibliography on Eriugena's philosophical work ]\n*[http://www.granta.demon.co.uk/arsm/jg/eriugena.html John Scottus Eriugena: Life and Works]\n*[http://www.pims.ca/research/johannes-scottus-eriugena-periphyseon Johannes Scottus Eriugena: Periphyseon] The new critical edition by \u00c9.

It is the unity of which all special phenomena are manifestations.<blockquote>Eriugena develops a Neoplatonic cosmology according to which the infinite, transcendent and 'unknown' God, who is beyond being and non-being, through a process of self-articulation, procession, or 'self-creation', proceeds from his divine 'darkness' or 'non-being' into the light of being, speaking the Word who is understood as Christ, and at the same timeless moment bringing forth the Primary Causes of all creation... He treats of the essentially dialectical relation between Creator and created, where God expresses Himself in creation and creation culminates in return to the divine.<ref name=Moran>[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scottus-eriugena/ Moran, Dermot, \"John Scottus Eriugena\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy  (Fall 2008 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)]</ref></blockquote>\nOf this nature there are four distinct species:\n\n#That which creates and is not created -this is God, the Source and Principle of all things;\n#That which is created and creates -this is the world of primordial causes or (Platonic) ideas;\n#That which is created and does not create\u2014 this is the world of phenomena, the world of contingent, sense-perceived things;\n#That which neither is created nor creates \u2014 this is God, the Term to which all things are returning.<ref name=Moran/>\n\nThe first is [[God]] as the ground or origin of all things. The \"creation\" of the world is in reality a ''theophania'', or showing forth of the Essence of God in the things created. Just as He reveals Himself to the mind and the soul in higher intellectual and spiritual truth, so He reveals Himself to the senses in the created world around us. Creation is, therefore, a process of unfolding of the Divine Nature. Nature in the second sense, is the world of primordial causes, or ideas, which the Father \"created\" in the Son, and which in turn \"create\", that is determine the generic and specific natures of concrete visible things. Since they are, though created, identical with God, and since their locus is the Word of God, the Second Person of the Blessed Trinity, they are operative causes and not merely static types. From this, however, it is not necessary to infer, as some critics have done, that according to Eriugena the primordial causes are identical with the Word. As examples of primordial causes Eriugena enumerates goodness, wisdom, intuition (insight), understanding, virtue, greatness, power, etc.<ref name=Turner>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05519a.htm  Turner, William. \"John Scotus Eriugena.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 5. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 30 June 2019{{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\nThe third sense, \"which is created and does not create\", is where the stream of reality, setting out from the centre, God, passing through the ideas in the Word, and enters the realm of space and time. Here they are no longer pure ideas but only the appearances of reality, that is phenomena. In the realm of space and time the ideas take on the burden of matter and become subject to multiplicity, change, imperfection, and decay. The material world, therefore, of our experience is composed of ideas clothed in matter \u2014 here Eriugena attempts a reconciliation of Platonism with Aristotelean notions. The last is God as the final end or goal of all things, that into which the world of created things ultimately returns. The return to God proceeds in the inverse order through all the steps which marked the downward course, or process of things from God. The elements become light, light becomes life, life becomes sense, sense becomes reason, reason becomes intellect, intellect becomes ideas in Christ, the Word of God, and through Christ returns to the oneness of God from which all the processes of nature began. This \"incorporation\" in Christ takes place by means of Divine grace in the Church, of which Christ is the invisible head.\n\nThus we distinguish in the divine system beginning, middle and end; but these three are in essence one; the difference is only the consequence of our finite comprehension. We are compelled to envisage this eternal process under the form of time, to apply temporal distinctions to that which is extra- or supra-temporal.\n\n==Commentary== \nFrench journalist and author [[:fr:Jean-Jacques Gabut|Jean-Jacques Gabut]], says \"Moreover, a certain [[pantheism]], or rather ''[[pandeism]]'', emerges from his work where Neo-Platonic inspiration perfectly complements the strict Christian orthodoxy.\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=50FDDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT23&dq=pand%C3%A9isme&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiByZ3owbveAhULxVkKHQRbBscQ6AEINTAC#v=onepage&q=pand%C3%A9isme&f=false Gabut, Jean-Jacques. ''Origines et fondements spirituels et sociologiques de la ma\u00e7onnerie \u00e9cossaise''], 2017</ref> According to [[William Turner (bishop of Buffalo)|William Turner]], professor of Philosophy at [[Catholic University of America]], the doctrine of the final return of all things to God shows very clearly the influence of Origen. In general, the system of thought outlined is a combination of neo-Platonic mysticism, emanationism, and pantheism which Eriugena strove in vain to reconcile with Aristotelean empiricism, Christian creationism, and theism. \"The result is a body of doctrines loosely articulated, in which the mystic and idealistic elements predominate, and in which there is much that is irreconcilable with Catholic dogma.\"<ref name=Turner/>\n\nEriugena himself denied explicitly that he was a pantheist. \"God is all in all. All things that are in God, even are God, are eternal...the creature subsists in God, and God is created in the creature in a wonderful and ineffable way, making himself manifest, invisible making himself visible...But the divine nature, he finally insists, because it is above being, is different from what it create within itself.\"<ref>O'Meara, John J., \"Introduction\", ''The Mind of Eriugena'', (John J. O'Meara and Ludwig Bieler, eds.), Dublin: Irish University Press 1973.</ref> Although Eriugena asserts the identity of God and creation, he explicitly rejects the view that God is the 'genus' or 'whole' (totum) of which the creatures are 'species' or 'parts'. Only metaphorically can it be said that God is a 'genus' or a 'whole'. Assertions concerning the immanence of God in creation are always balanced in Eriugena's writings by assertions of God's transcendence above all things.\"<ref name=Moran/> \n\n''De divisione naturae'' was condemned by a [[council at Sens]] by [[Honorius III]] (1225), for promoting the identity of God and creation, and by [[Pope]] [[Gregory XIII]] in 1585. In 1681, the long-lost work was found at [[Oxford University]], and was immediately placed on the '[[Index of Forbidden Books]]', a turn of events which likely actually spurred its popularity. Despite this result, Turner noted of Eriugena that \"there can be no doubt that he himself abhorred heresy, was disposed to treat the heretic with no small degree of harshness..., and all through his life believed himself an unswervingly loyal son of the Church.\"<ref name=Turner/>\n\n==Legacy==\n''The Division of Nature'' has been called the final achievement of ancient philosophy, a work which \"synthesizes the philosophical accomplishments of fifteen centuries and appears as the final achievement of ancient philosophy.\"<ref>Burch, George. ''Early Medieval Philosophy'', Kings Crown Press. 1951</ref> It is presented, like [[Alcuin]]'s book, as a dialogue between Master and Pupil. Eriugena anticipates [[Thomas Aquinas]], who said that one cannot know and believe a thing at the same time. Eriugena explains that reason is necessary to understand and interpret revelation. \"Authority is the source of knowledge\", but the reason of mankind is the norm by which all authority is judged.<ref name=eriugena/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{catholic|title=John Scotus Eriugena}}\n*{{cite SEP |url-id=scottus-eriugena |title=John Scottus Eriugena |last=Moran |first=Dermot}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=RRb5DpHEgaoC&dq=De+divisione+naturae&source=gbs_navlinks_s Digitized Latin version on Google Books]\n*[https://www.ontology.co/eriugena-two.htm Eriugena, ''Periphyseon'' Book I: Aristotelian Logic and Categories]\n*[https://www.ontology.co/biblio/eriugena-editions.htm Complete List of the Editions and Translations of the Works of Eriugena]\n*[https://www.ontology.co/biblio/eriugena-biblio-one.htm Annotated bibliography on Eriugena's philosophical work ]\n*[http://www.granta.demon.co.uk/arsm/jg/eriugena.html John Scottus Eriugena: Life and Works]\n*[http://www.pims.ca/research/johannes-scottus-eriugena-periphyseon Johannes Scottus Eriugena: Periphyseon] The new critical edition by \u00c9.

Since the implosion of the USSR in December 1991, Armenia has switched to small-scale agriculture away from the large agroindustrial complexes of the Soviet era. The agricultural sector has long-term needs for more investment and updated technology. Armenia is a food importer, and its [[mineral]] deposits ([[gold]] and [[bauxite]]) are small. The ongoing conflict with Azerbaijan over the ethnic Armenian-dominated region of Nagorno-Karabakh (which was part of Soviet Azerbaijan) and the breakup of the centrally directed [[economic system]] of the former Soviet Union contributed to a severe economic decline in the early 1990s.\n\n==Global competitiveness==\n{{See also|Armenia#International_Economy-related_Rankings}}\n\nIn the 2020 report of [[Index of Economic Freedom]] by [[The Heritage Foundation|Heritage Foundation]], Armenia is classified as \"mostly free\" and ranks 34th, improving by 13 positions and ahead of all other [[Eurasian Economic Union]] countries and many [[EU]] countries including Cyprus, Bulgaria, Romania, Poland, Belgium, Spain, France, Portugal and Italy.<ref name=\"economic-index\">{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/Index/ranking|title=Heritage Index of Economic Freedom|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[The Heritage Foundation]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090720010300/http://www.heritage.org/index/ranking.aspx|archive-date=20 July 2009|access-date=22 July 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.heritage.org/index/country/armenia|title=Armenia Economy: Population, GDP, Inflation, Business, Trade, FDI, Corruption|website=www.heritage.org|language=en|access-date=2019-10-24}}</ref>\n\nIn the 2019 report (data for 2017) of [[Economic Freedom of the World]] published by [[Fraser Institute]] Armenia ranks 27th (classified most free) out of 162 economies.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.fraserinstitute.org/studies/economic-freedom-of-the-world-2018-annual-report|title=Economic Freedom of the World: 2018 Annual Report|date=2018-09-25|work=Fraser Institute|access-date=2018-11-06|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fraserinstitute.org/studies/economic-freedom|title=You are being redirected...|website=www.fraserinstitute.org|access-date=2019-10-24}}</ref>\n\nIn the 2019 report of [[Global Competitiveness Index]] Armenia ranks 69th out of 141 economies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/reports/how-to-end-a-decade-of-lost-productivity-growth/|title=Global Competitiveness Report 2019|website=World Economic Forum|access-date=2019-10-24}}</ref>\n\nIn the 2020 report (data for 2019) of [[Ease of doing business index|Doing Business]] Index Armenia ranks 47th with 10th rank on \"starting business\" sub-index.\n\nIn the 2019 report (data for 2018) of [[Human Development Index]] by [[United Nations Development Programme|UNDP]] Armenia ranked 81st and is classified into \"high human development\" group.\n\nIn the 2018 report (data for 2017) of [[Corruption Perceptions Index]] by [[Transparency International]] Armenia ranked 105 of 180 countries.\n\n==History of the modern Armenian economy==\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, the territory of present-day Armenia was a backward agricultural region with some [[copper]] mining and [[cognac]] production. From 1914 through 1921, Caucasian Armenia suffered from war, revolution, the influx of refugees from Turkish Armenia, disease, hunger and economic misery. About 200,000 people died in 1919 alone. At that point, only American relief efforts saved Armenia from total collapse.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=42}}\n\n[[File:Trans-100millones-rev.jpg|thumbnail|100 million rubles banknote]]\n\nThe first Soviet Armenian government regulated economic activity stringently, nationalising all economic enterprises, requisitioning [[grain]] from peasants, and suppressing most private market activity. This first experiment of state control ended with the advent of Soviet leader [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s [[New Economic Policy]] (NEP) of 1921&ndash;27. This policy continued state control of the large enterprises and banks, but peasants could market much of their grain, and small businesses could function. In Armenia, the NEP years brought partial recovery from the economic disaster of the post-World War I period. By 1926 agricultural production in Armenia had reached nearly three-quarters of its prewar level.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=42}}\n\nBy the end of the 1920s, Stalin's regime had revoked the NEP and reestablished the state monopoly on all economic activity. Once this occurred, the main goal of the Soviet economic policy in Armenia was to turn a predominantly agrarian and rural republic into an industrial and urban one. Among other restrictions, peasants now were forced to sell nearly all of their output to state procurement agencies rather than at the market. From the 1930s through the 1960s, an industrial infrastructure has been constructed. Besides hydroelectric plants and canals, roads were built and gas pipelines were laid to bring fuel and food from Azerbaijan and Russia.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=42}}\n\nThe Stalinist command economy, in which market forces were suppressed and all orders for production and distribution came from the state authorities, survived in all its essential features until the fall of the Soviet regime in 1991. In the early stages of the communist economic revolution, Armenia underwent a fundamental transformation into a \"proletarian\" society. Between 1929 and 1939, the percentage of Armenia's work force categorised as industrial workers grew from 13% to 31%. By 1935 industry supplied 62% of Armenia's economic production. Highly integrated and sheltered within artificial barter economy of the Soviet system from the 1930s until the end of the communist era, the Armenian economy showed few signs of self-sufficiency at any time during that period. In 1988 Armenia produced only 0.9% of the [[net material product]] of the Soviet Union (1.2% of industry, 0.7% of agriculture). The republic retained 1.4% of total state budget revenue, delivered 63.7% of its NMP to other republics, and exported only 1.4% of what it produced to markets outside the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=42&ndash;43}}\n\n[[Agriculture]] accounted for only 20% of net material product and 10% of employment before the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991.\n\nArmenia's industry was especially dependent on the Soviet military-industrial complex. About 40% of all enterprises in the republic were devoted to defense, and some factories lost 60% to 80% of their business in the last years of the Soviet Union, when massive cuts were made in the national defense expenditures. As the republic's economy faced the prospects of competing in world markets in the mid 1990s, the great liabilities of Armenia's industry were its outdated equipment and infrastructure and the pollution emitted by many of the country's heavy industrial plants.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=43}}\n\nIn 1991, Armenia's last year as a Soviet republic, national income fell 12% from the previous year, while per capita gross national product was 4,920 rubles, only 68% of the Soviet average. In large part due to the earthquake of 1988, the Azerbaijani blockade that began in 1989 and the collapse of the international trading system of the Soviet Union, the Armenian economy of the early 1990s remained far below its 1980 production levels. In the first years of independence (1992&ndash;93), inflation was extremely high, productivity and national income dropped dramatically, and the national budget ran large deficits.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=41}}\n\n===Post-communist economic reform===\nArmenia introduced elements of the free market and privatisation into their economic system in the late 1980s, when [[Mikhail Gorbachov]] began advocating economic reform. Cooperatives were set up in the service sector, particularly in restaurants, although substantial resistance came from the [[Communist Party of Armenia (Soviet Union)|Communist Party of Armenia]] (CPA) and other groups that had enjoyed privileged position in the old economy. In the late 1980s, much of Armenia's economy already was opening either semi-officially or illegally, with widespread [[corruption]] and [[bribery]]. The so-called mafia, made up of interconnected groups of powerful officials and their relatives and friends, sabotaged the efforts of reformers to create a lawful market system. When the December 1988 earthquake brought millions of dollars of foreign aid to the devastated regions of Armenia, much of the money went to corrupt and criminal elements.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=48&ndash;50}}\n\nBeginning in 1991, the democratically elected government pushed vigorously for privatisation and market relations, although its efforts were frustrated by the old ways of doing business in Armenia, the Azerbaijani blockade, and the costs of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]]. In 1992, the Law on the Programme of Privatisation and Decentralisation of Incompletely Constructed Facilities established a state privatisation committee, with members from all political parties. In middle 1993, the committee announced a two-year privatisation programme, whose first stage would be privatisation of 30% of state enterprises, mostly services and light industries. The remaining 70%, including many bankrupt, nonfunctional enterprises, were to be privatised in a later stage with a minimum of government restriction, to encourage private initiative. For all enterprises, the workers would receive 20% of their firm's property free of charge; 30% would be distributed to all citizens by means of vouchers; and the remaining 50% was to be distributed by the government, with preference given to members of the labour organisations. A major problem of this system, however, was the lack of supporting legislation covering foreign investment protection, bankruptcy, monopoly policy, and consumer protection.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=50}}\n\nIn the first post-communist years, efforts to interest foreign investors in joint enterprises were only moderately successful because of the blockade and the energy shortage. Only in late 1993 was a department of foreign investment established in the [[Ministry of Economy (Armenia)|Ministry of Economy]], to spread information about Armenia's investment opportunities and improve the legal infrastructure for investment activity. A specific goal of this agency was creating a market for scientific and technical intellectual property.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=50}}\n\nA few Armenians living abroad made large-scale investments. Besides a toy factory and construction projects, diaspora Armenians built a cold storage plant (which in its first years had little produce to store) and established the [[American University of Armenia]] in Yerevan to teach the techniques necessary to run a market economy.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=50}}\n\nArmenia was admitted to the [[International Monetary Fund]] in May 1992 and to the [[World Bank]] in September. A year later, the government complained that those organisations were holding back financial assistance and announced its intention to move toward fuller price liberalisation, and the removal of all [[tariff]]s, quotas, and restrictions of foreign trade. Although privatisation had slowed because of catastrophic collapse of the economy, Prime Minister [[Hrant Bagratyan]] informed the United States officials in the fall of 1993 that plans had been made to embark on a renewed privatisation programme by the end of the year.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=50&ndash;51}}\n\nLike other former states, Armenia's economy suffers from the legacy of a centrally [[planned economy]] and the breakdown of former Soviet trading patterns. Soviet investment in and support of Armenian industry has virtually disappeared, so that few major enterprises are still able to function. In addition, the effects of the [[1988 Spitak earthquake|1988 earthquake]], which killed more than 25,000 people and made 500,000 homeless, are still being felt. Although a cease-fire has held since 1994, the conflict with [[Azerbaijan]] over [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] has not been resolved. The consequent blockade along both the Azerbaijani and Turkish borders has devastated the economy, because of Armenia's dependence on outside supplies of energy and most raw materials. Land routes through Azerbaijan and Turkey are closed; routes through Georgia and Iran are adequate and reliable. In 1992\u201393, the GDP had fallen nearly 60% from its 1989 level. The national currency, the [[Armenian dram|dram]], suffered [[hyperinflation]] for the first few years after its introduction in 1993.\n\nArmenia has registered strong economic growth since 1995 and inflation has been negligible for the past several years. New sectors, such as precious stone processing and jewelry making and communication technology (primarily [[Armenia Telephone Company|Armentel]], which is left from the USSR era and is owned by external investors). This steady economic progress has earned Armenia increasing support from international institutions. The [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), [[World Bank]], EBRD, as well as other international financial institutions (IFIs) and foreign countries are extending considerable grants and loans. Total loans extended to Armenia since 1993 exceed [[USD|$]]800 million. These loans are targeted at reducing the budget deficit, stabilizing the local currency; developing private businesses; energy; the agriculture, food processing, transportation, and health and education sectors; and ongoing rehabilitation work in the [[earthquake zone]].\n\nBy 1994, however, the Armenian government had launched an ambitious IMF-sponsored economic liberalization program that resulted in positive growth rates in 1995\u20132005. Armenia joined the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) in January 2003. Armenia also has managed to slash inflation, stabilize its currency, and privatize most small- and medium-sized enterprises. Armenia's unemployment rate, however, remains high, despite strong economic growth.\n\nThe chronic energy shortages Armenia suffered in the early and mid-1990s have been offset by the energy supplied by one of its nuclear power plants at [[Metsamor]]. Armenia is now a net energy exporter, although it does not have sufficient generating capacity to replace [[Armenian Nuclear Power Plant|Metsamor]], which is under international pressure to close. The electricity distribution system was [[privatized]] in 2002.\n\n==Outperforming GDP growth==\n[[File:GDP growth rates in Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan in 2010 - 2017.png|alt=|thumb|500x500px|GDP growth rates in Armenia and some neighboring countries and some regions in years 2010 - 2017]]\n\nAccording to official preliminary data GDP grew by 7.6 per cent in 2019,  largest recording growth since 2008.<ref name=\":9\" /><ref name=\":16\" />\n\nGDP per capita was approximately $4,280 in 2018 and is expected to reach $4604 in 2019.<ref name=\"news.am.2019.11.09\">{{Cite web|url=https://news.am/eng/news/480753.html|title=Armenia Finance Ministry: GDP per capita will be $4,600 in 2019|website=news.am|language=en|access-date=2018-11-13}}</ref> In terms of GDP per capita [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] expects Armenia to surpass neighboring Georgia in 2019 and neighboring Azerbaijan in 2020.<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2019/02/weodata/weorept.aspx?sy=2017&ey=2024&scsm=1&ssd=1&sort=subject&ds=.&br=1&pr1.x=45&pr1.y=8&c=911,912,915&s=NGDP_D,NGDPDPC,PPPPC,NGSD_NGDP,PCPI,PCPIPCH,TM_RPCH,TX_RPCH,LP,GGXWDG_NGDP,BCA,BCA_NGDPD&grp=0&a=|title=Report for Selected Countries and Subjects|website=www.imf.org|access-date=2019-10-21}}</ref>\n\nWith 8.3% Armenia recorded highest degree of GDP growth among [[Eurasian Economic Union]] countries in 2018 January\u2013June against the same period of 2017.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://armenpress.am/eng/news/956452.html|title=Armenia leads EEU countries on level of economic growth \u2013 official EEC data|work=armenpress.am|access-date=2018-12-03|language=en}}</ref>\n\nEarlier, the economy of Armenia grew by 7.5% in 2017 and reached a nominal GDP of $11.5 billion per annum, while per capita figure grew by 10.1% and reached $3880.<ref name=\"arka2017gdp\">{{cite web|title=ARKA 2017 GDP|url=http://arka.am/en/news/economy/armenia_ends_2017_with_7_5_economic_growth_/|accessdate=18 January 2017}}</ref> With 7.29% Armenia was second best in GDP per capita growth terms in Europe and Central Asia in 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_cd&idim=country:ARM:AZE:GEO&hl=en&dl=en#!ctype=c&strail=false&bcs=d&nselm=s&met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_kd_zg&scale_y=lin&ind_y=false&idim=country:ARM:AZE:GEO:ALB:AND:AUT:BLR:BEL:BIH:BGR:CHI:HRV:CYP:DNK:CZE:EST:FIN:FRO:FRA:DEU:GRC:GRL:HUN:ISL:IRL:IMN:ITA:KAZ:XKX:KGZ:LVA:LIE:LTU:LUX:MKD:MDA:MCO:MNE:NLD:NOR:POL:PRT:ROU:RUS:SMR:SRB:SVK:SVN:ESP:SWE:CHE:TJK:TUR:TKM:UKR:GBR:UZB&ifdim=country:region:ECS&hl=en_US&dl=en&ind=false|title=World Development Indicators - Google Public Data Explorer|website=www.google.com|access-date=2019-04-30}}</ref>\n\nArmenian GDP PPP (measured in current international dollar) grew total of 316% per capita in the years 2000-2017 becoming 6th best worldwide in these terms.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.CD?end=2017&locations=AM-RO-GE-CN-EU&start=2000|title=GDP per capita, PPP (current international $) {{!}} The World Bank|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://i.redd.it/022odntsae621.png|title=map of GDP PPP 2000-2017 growth rates worldwide (Data by the World Bank)|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nGDP grew 40.7% between 2012 and 2018, and key banking indicators like assets and credit exposures almost doubled.<ref name=\"arka2019growth\" />[[File:GDP Armenia Georgia Azerbaijan 1990 2016.jpg|500px|GDP per capita of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia in years 1990\u20132016, World Bank data.|thumb]]\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

According to economist Eduard Aghajanov, Armenia could have repaid them with low-interest loans from other, presumably Western sources, or with some of its hard currency reserves which then totaled about $450 million. Furthermore, Aghajanov points to the Armenian government's failure to eliminate widespread corruption and mismanagement in the energy sector \u2013 abuses that cost Armenia at least $50 million in losses each year, according to one estimate.<ref name=\"Eurasianet-May-7-03\"/>\n\nPolitical observers say that Armenia's economic cooperation with Russia has been one of the least transparent areas of the Armenian government's work. The debt arrangements have been personally negotiated by (then) Defense Minister (and later President) [[Serge Sarkisian]], initially Kocharyan's closest political associate. Other top government officials, including former Prime Minister [[Andranik Markarian]], had little say on the issue. Furthermore, all of the controversial agreements have been announced after Sarkisian's frequent trips to Moscow, without prior public discussion.<ref name=\"Eurasianet-May-7-03\"/>\n\nFinally, while Armenia is not the only ex-Soviet state that has incurred multi-million-dollar debts to Russia over the past decades, it is the only state to have so far given up such a large share of its economic infrastructure to Russia. For example, pro-Western [[Ukraine]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] (both of which owe Russia more than Armenia) have managed to reschedule repayment of their debts.<ref name=\"Eurasianet-May-7-03\"/>\n\n==Transportation routes and energy lines==\n{{see also|Transport in Armenia}}\n\n===Internal===\nSince early 2008, Armenia's entire rail network is managed by the Russian state railway under brand [[South Caucasus Railway]]s.<ref name=\"ArmLib-Oct14-2008\">[http://www.armenialiberty.org/armeniareport/report/en/2008/10/6B68C3F8-5DCC-4B9B-81E5-C638FEDE172D.ASP \"Armenia \u2018Pressing Ahead\u2019 With Iran Rail Link\"], Armenia Liberty ([[RFE/RL]], October 14, 2008.</ref><ref name=\"ArmLib-Aug13-2008\">[http://www.armenialiberty.org/armeniareport/report/en/2008/08/F3509195-D04E-4187-AA45-23B61ACF430F.asp \"Armenia Scrambles To Restore Vital Supplies Via Georgia\"], Armenia Liberty ([[RFE/RL]]), August 18, 2008.</ref>\n\n===Through Georgia===\nRussian natural gas reaches Armenia via a pipeline through Georgia.\n\nThe only operational rail link into Armenia is from [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].

Small amounts of coal, gas and petroleum have not yet been developed.\n\nArmenia's severe trade imbalance has been offset somewhat by international aid, [[remittances]] from Armenians working abroad, and foreign direct investment. Economic ties with Russia remain close, especially in the energy sector.\n\nThe former government has made some improvements in tax and customs administration in recent years, but anti-corruption measures have been more difficult to implement in the period when [[Republican Party of Armenia]] was in power. This is expected to change after the [[2018 Armenian Velvet Revolution|2018 Armenian revolution]].\n\n==Overview==\nUnder the old Soviet central planning system, Armenia had developed a modern industrial sector, supplying machine tools, textiles, and other manufactured goods to sister republics in exchange for raw materials and energy. Since the implosion of the USSR in December 1991, Armenia has switched to small-scale agriculture away from the large agroindustrial complexes of the Soviet era. The agricultural sector has long-term needs for more investment and updated technology. Armenia is a food importer, and its [[mineral]] deposits ([[gold]] and [[bauxite]]) are small. The ongoing conflict with Azerbaijan over the ethnic Armenian-dominated region of Nagorno-Karabakh (which was part of Soviet Azerbaijan) and the breakup of the centrally directed [[economic system]] of the former Soviet Union contributed to a severe economic decline in the early 1990s.\n\n==Global competitiveness==\n{{See also|Armenia#International_Economy-related_Rankings}}\n\nIn the 2020 report of [[Index of Economic Freedom]] by [[The Heritage Foundation|Heritage Foundation]], Armenia is classified as \"mostly free\" and ranks 34th, improving by 13 positions and ahead of all other [[Eurasian Economic Union]] countries and many [[EU]] countries including Cyprus, Bulgaria, Romania, Poland, Belgium, Spain, France, Portugal and Italy.<ref name=\"economic-index\">{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/Index/ranking|title=Heritage Index of Economic Freedom|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[The Heritage Foundation]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090720010300/http://www.heritage.org/index/ranking.aspx|archive-date=20 July 2009|access-date=22 July 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.heritage.org/index/country/armenia|title=Armenia Economy: Population, GDP, Inflation, Business, Trade, FDI, Corruption|website=www.heritage.org|language=en|access-date=2019-10-24}}</ref>\n\nIn the 2019 report (data for 2017) of [[Economic Freedom of the World]] published by [[Fraser Institute]] Armenia ranks 27th (classified most free) out of 162 economies.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.fraserinstitute.org/studies/economic-freedom-of-the-world-2018-annual-report|title=Economic Freedom of the World: 2018 Annual Report|date=2018-09-25|work=Fraser Institute|access-date=2018-11-06|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fraserinstitute.org/studies/economic-freedom|title=You are being redirected...|website=www.fraserinstitute.org|access-date=2019-10-24}}</ref>\n\nIn the 2019 report of [[Global Competitiveness Index]] Armenia ranks 69th out of 141 economies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/reports/how-to-end-a-decade-of-lost-productivity-growth/|title=Global Competitiveness Report 2019|website=World Economic Forum|access-date=2019-10-24}}</ref>\n\nIn the 2020 report (data for 2019) of [[Ease of doing business index|Doing Business]] Index Armenia ranks 47th with 10th rank on \"starting business\" sub-index.\n\nIn the 2019 report (data for 2018) of [[Human Development Index]] by [[United Nations Development Programme|UNDP]] Armenia ranked 81st and is classified into \"high human development\" group.\n\nIn the 2018 report (data for 2017) of [[Corruption Perceptions Index]] by [[Transparency International]] Armenia ranked 105 of 180 countries.\n\n==History of the modern Armenian economy==\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, the territory of present-day Armenia was a backward agricultural region with some [[copper]] mining and [[cognac]] production. From 1914 through 1921, Caucasian Armenia suffered from war, revolution, the influx of refugees from Turkish Armenia, disease, hunger and economic misery. About 200,000 people died in 1919 alone. At that point, only American relief efforts saved Armenia from total collapse.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=42}}\n\n[[File:Trans-100millones-rev.jpg|thumbnail|100 million rubles banknote]]\n\nThe first Soviet Armenian government regulated economic activity stringently, nationalising all economic enterprises, requisitioning [[grain]] from peasants, and suppressing most private market activity. This first experiment of state control ended with the advent of Soviet leader [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s [[New Economic Policy]] (NEP) of 1921&ndash;27. This policy continued state control of the large enterprises and banks, but peasants could market much of their grain, and small businesses could function. In Armenia, the NEP years brought partial recovery from the economic disaster of the post-World War I period. By 1926 agricultural production in Armenia had reached nearly three-quarters of its prewar level.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=42}}\n\nBy the end of the 1920s, Stalin's regime had revoked the NEP and reestablished the state monopoly on all economic activity. Once this occurred, the main goal of the Soviet economic policy in Armenia was to turn a predominantly agrarian and rural republic into an industrial and urban one. Among other restrictions, peasants now were forced to sell nearly all of their output to state procurement agencies rather than at the market. From the 1930s through the 1960s, an industrial infrastructure has been constructed. Besides hydroelectric plants and canals, roads were built and gas pipelines were laid to bring fuel and food from Azerbaijan and Russia.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=42}}\n\nThe Stalinist command economy, in which market forces were suppressed and all orders for production and distribution came from the state authorities, survived in all its essential features until the fall of the Soviet regime in 1991. In the early stages of the communist economic revolution, Armenia underwent a fundamental transformation into a \"proletarian\" society. Between 1929 and 1939, the percentage of Armenia's work force categorised as industrial workers grew from 13% to 31%. By 1935 industry supplied 62% of Armenia's economic production. Highly integrated and sheltered within artificial barter economy of the Soviet system from the 1930s until the end of the communist era, the Armenian economy showed few signs of self-sufficiency at any time during that period. In 1988 Armenia produced only 0.9% of the [[net material product]] of the Soviet Union (1.2% of industry, 0.7% of agriculture). The republic retained 1.4% of total state budget revenue, delivered 63.7% of its NMP to other republics, and exported only 1.4% of what it produced to markets outside the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=42&ndash;43}}\n\n[[Agriculture]] accounted for only 20% of net material product and 10% of employment before the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991.\n\nArmenia's industry was especially dependent on the Soviet military-industrial complex. About 40% of all enterprises in the republic were devoted to defense, and some factories lost 60% to 80% of their business in the last years of the Soviet Union, when massive cuts were made in the national defense expenditures. As the republic's economy faced the prospects of competing in world markets in the mid 1990s, the great liabilities of Armenia's industry were its outdated equipment and infrastructure and the pollution emitted by many of the country's heavy industrial plants.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=43}}\n\nIn 1991, Armenia's last year as a Soviet republic, national income fell 12% from the previous year, while per capita gross national product was 4,920 rubles, only 68% of the Soviet average. In large part due to the earthquake of 1988, the Azerbaijani blockade that began in 1989 and the collapse of the international trading system of the Soviet Union, the Armenian economy of the early 1990s remained far below its 1980 production levels. In the first years of independence (1992&ndash;93), inflation was extremely high, productivity and national income dropped dramatically, and the national budget ran large deficits.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=41}}\n\n===Post-communist economic reform===\nArmenia introduced elements of the free market and privatisation into their economic system in the late 1980s, when [[Mikhail Gorbachov]] began advocating economic reform. Cooperatives were set up in the service sector, particularly in restaurants, although substantial resistance came from the [[Communist Party of Armenia (Soviet Union)|Communist Party of Armenia]] (CPA) and other groups that had enjoyed privileged position in the old economy. In the late 1980s, much of Armenia's economy already was opening either semi-officially or illegally, with widespread [[corruption]] and [[bribery]]. The so-called mafia, made up of interconnected groups of powerful officials and their relatives and friends, sabotaged the efforts of reformers to create a lawful market system. When the December 1988 earthquake brought millions of dollars of foreign aid to the devastated regions of Armenia, much of the money went to corrupt and criminal elements.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=48&ndash;50}}\n\nBeginning in 1991, the democratically elected government pushed vigorously for privatisation and market relations, although its efforts were frustrated by the old ways of doing business in Armenia, the Azerbaijani blockade, and the costs of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]]. In 1992, the Law on the Programme of Privatisation and Decentralisation of Incompletely Constructed Facilities established a state privatisation committee, with members from all political parties. In middle 1993, the committee announced a two-year privatisation programme, whose first stage would be privatisation of 30% of state enterprises, mostly services and light industries. The remaining 70%, including many bankrupt, nonfunctional enterprises, were to be privatised in a later stage with a minimum of government restriction, to encourage private initiative. For all enterprises, the workers would receive 20% of their firm's property free of charge; 30% would be distributed to all citizens by means of vouchers; and the remaining 50% was to be distributed by the government, with preference given to members of the labour organisations. A major problem of this system, however, was the lack of supporting legislation covering foreign investment protection, bankruptcy, monopoly policy, and consumer protection.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=50}}\n\nIn the first post-communist years, efforts to interest foreign investors in joint enterprises were only moderately successful because of the blockade and the energy shortage. Only in late 1993 was a department of foreign investment established in the [[Ministry of Economy (Armenia)|Ministry of Economy]], to spread information about Armenia's investment opportunities and improve the legal infrastructure for investment activity. A specific goal of this agency was creating a market for scientific and technical intellectual property.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=50}}\n\nA few Armenians living abroad made large-scale investments. Besides a toy factory and construction projects, diaspora Armenians built a cold storage plant (which in its first years had little produce to store) and established the [[American University of Armenia]] in Yerevan to teach the techniques necessary to run a market economy.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=50}}\n\nArmenia was admitted to the [[International Monetary Fund]] in May 1992 and to the [[World Bank]] in September. A year later, the government complained that those organisations were holding back financial assistance and announced its intention to move toward fuller price liberalisation, and the removal of all [[tariff]]s, quotas, and restrictions of foreign trade. Although privatisation had slowed because of catastrophic collapse of the economy, Prime Minister [[Hrant Bagratyan]] informed the United States officials in the fall of 1993 that plans had been made to embark on a renewed privatisation programme by the end of the year.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=50&ndash;51}}\n\nLike other former states, Armenia's economy suffers from the legacy of a centrally [[planned economy]] and the breakdown of former Soviet trading patterns. Soviet investment in and support of Armenian industry has virtually disappeared, so that few major enterprises are still able to function. In addition, the effects of the [[1988 Spitak earthquake|1988 earthquake]], which killed more than 25,000 people and made 500,000 homeless, are still being felt. Although a cease-fire has held since 1994, the conflict with [[Azerbaijan]] over [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] has not been resolved. The consequent blockade along both the Azerbaijani and Turkish borders has devastated the economy, because of Armenia's dependence on outside supplies of energy and most raw materials. Land routes through Azerbaijan and Turkey are closed; routes through Georgia and Iran are adequate and reliable. In 1992\u201393, the GDP had fallen nearly 60% from its 1989 level. The national currency, the [[Armenian dram|dram]], suffered [[hyperinflation]] for the first few years after its introduction in 1993.\n\nArmenia has registered strong economic growth since 1995 and inflation has been negligible for the past several years. New sectors, such as precious stone processing and jewelry making and communication technology (primarily [[Armenia Telephone Company|Armentel]], which is left from the USSR era and is owned by external investors). This steady economic progress has earned Armenia increasing support from international institutions. The [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), [[World Bank]], EBRD, as well as other international financial institutions (IFIs) and foreign countries are extending considerable grants and loans. Total loans extended to Armenia since 1993 exceed [[USD|$]]800 million. These loans are targeted at reducing the budget deficit, stabilizing the local currency; developing private businesses; energy; the agriculture, food processing, transportation, and health and education sectors; and ongoing rehabilitation work in the [[earthquake zone]].\n\nBy 1994, however, the Armenian government had launched an ambitious IMF-sponsored economic liberalization program that resulted in positive growth rates in 1995\u20132005. Armenia joined the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) in January 2003. Armenia also has managed to slash inflation, stabilize its currency, and privatize most small- and medium-sized enterprises. Armenia's unemployment rate, however, remains high, despite strong economic growth.\n\nThe chronic energy shortages Armenia suffered in the early and mid-1990s have been offset by the energy supplied by one of its nuclear power plants at [[Metsamor]]. Armenia is now a net energy exporter, although it does not have sufficient generating capacity to replace [[Armenian Nuclear Power Plant|Metsamor]], which is under international pressure to close. The electricity distribution system was [[privatized]] in 2002.\n\n==Outperforming GDP growth==\n[[File:GDP growth rates in Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan in 2010 - 2017.png|alt=|thumb|500x500px|GDP growth rates in Armenia and some neighboring countries and some regions in years 2010 - 2017]]\n\nAccording to official preliminary data GDP grew by 7.6 per cent in 2019,  largest recording growth since 2008.<ref name=\":9\" /><ref name=\":16\" />\n\nGDP per capita was approximately $4,280 in 2018 and is expected to reach $4604 in 2019.<ref name=\"news.am.2019.11.09\">{{Cite web|url=https://news.am/eng/news/480753.html|title=Armenia Finance Ministry: GDP per capita will be $4,600 in 2019|website=news.am|language=en|access-date=2018-11-13}}</ref> In terms of GDP per capita [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] expects Armenia to surpass neighboring Georgia in 2019 and neighboring Azerbaijan in 2020.<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2019/02/weodata/weorept.aspx?sy=2017&ey=2024&scsm=1&ssd=1&sort=subject&ds=.&br=1&pr1.x=45&pr1.y=8&c=911,912,915&s=NGDP_D,NGDPDPC,PPPPC,NGSD_NGDP,PCPI,PCPIPCH,TM_RPCH,TX_RPCH,LP,GGXWDG_NGDP,BCA,BCA_NGDPD&grp=0&a=|title=Report for Selected Countries and Subjects|website=www.imf.org|access-date=2019-10-21}}</ref>\n\nWith 8.3% Armenia recorded highest degree of GDP growth among [[Eurasian Economic Union]] countries in 2018 January\u2013June against the same period of 2017.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://armenpress.am/eng/news/956452.html|title=Armenia leads EEU countries on level of economic growth \u2013 official EEC data|work=armenpress.am|access-date=2018-12-03|language=en}}</ref>\n\nEarlier, the economy of Armenia grew by 7.5% in 2017 and reached a nominal GDP of $11.5 billion per annum, while per capita figure grew by 10.1% and reached $3880.<ref name=\"arka2017gdp\">{{cite web|title=ARKA 2017 GDP|url=http://arka.am/en/news/economy/armenia_ends_2017_with_7_5_economic_growth_/|accessdate=18 January 2017}}</ref> With 7.29% Armenia was second best in GDP per capita growth terms in Europe and Central Asia in 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_cd&idim=country:ARM:AZE:GEO&hl=en&dl=en#!ctype=c&strail=false&bcs=d&nselm=s&met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_kd_zg&scale_y=lin&ind_y=false&idim=country:ARM:AZE:GEO:ALB:AND:AUT:BLR:BEL:BIH:BGR:CHI:HRV:CYP:DNK:CZE:EST:FIN:FRO:FRA:DEU:GRC:GRL:HUN:ISL:IRL:IMN:ITA:KAZ:XKX:KGZ:LVA:LIE:LTU:LUX:MKD:MDA:MCO:MNE:NLD:NOR:POL:PRT:ROU:RUS:SMR:SRB:SVK:SVN:ESP:SWE:CHE:TJK:TUR:TKM:UKR:GBR:UZB&ifdim=country:region:ECS&hl=en_US&dl=en&ind=false|title=World Development Indicators - Google Public Data Explorer|website=www.google.com|access-date=2019-04-30}}</ref>\n\nArmenian GDP PPP (measured in current international dollar) grew total of 316% per capita in the years 2000-2017 becoming 6th best worldwide in these terms.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.CD?end=2017&locations=AM-RO-GE-CN-EU&start=2000|title=GDP per capita, PPP (current international $) {{!}} The World Bank|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://i.redd.it/022odntsae621.png|title=map of GDP PPP 2000-2017 growth rates worldwide (Data by the World Bank)|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nGDP grew 40.7% between 2012 and 2018, and key banking indicators like assets and credit exposures almost doubled.<ref name=\"arka2019growth\" />[[File:GDP Armenia Georgia Azerbaijan 1990 2016.jpg|500px|GDP per capita of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia in years 1990\u20132016, World Bank data.|thumb]]\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

According to economist Eduard Aghajanov, Armenia could have repaid them with low-interest loans from other, presumably Western sources, or with some of its hard currency reserves which then totaled about $450 million. Furthermore, Aghajanov points to the Armenian government's failure to eliminate widespread corruption and mismanagement in the energy sector \u2013 abuses that cost Armenia at least $50 million in losses each year, according to one estimate.<ref name=\"Eurasianet-May-7-03\"/>\n\nPolitical observers say that Armenia's economic cooperation with Russia has been one of the least transparent areas of the Armenian government's work. The debt arrangements have been personally negotiated by (then) Defense Minister (and later President) [[Serge Sarkisian]], initially Kocharyan's closest political associate. Other top government officials, including former Prime Minister [[Andranik Markarian]], had little say on the issue. Furthermore, all of the controversial agreements have been announced after Sarkisian's frequent trips to Moscow, without prior public discussion.<ref name=\"Eurasianet-May-7-03\"/>\n\nFinally, while Armenia is not the only ex-Soviet state that has incurred multi-million-dollar debts to Russia over the past decades, it is the only state to have so far given up such a large share of its economic infrastructure to Russia. For example, pro-Western [[Ukraine]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] (both of which owe Russia more than Armenia) have managed to reschedule repayment of their debts.<ref name=\"Eurasianet-May-7-03\"/>\n\n==Transportation routes and energy lines==\n{{see also|Transport in Armenia}}\n\n===Internal===\nSince early 2008, Armenia's entire rail network is managed by the Russian state railway under brand [[South Caucasus Railway]]s.<ref name=\"ArmLib-Oct14-2008\">[http://www.armenialiberty.org/armeniareport/report/en/2008/10/6B68C3F8-5DCC-4B9B-81E5-C638FEDE172D.ASP \"Armenia \u2018Pressing Ahead\u2019 With Iran Rail Link\"], Armenia Liberty ([[RFE/RL]], October 14, 2008.</ref><ref name=\"ArmLib-Aug13-2008\">[http://www.armenialiberty.org/armeniareport/report/en/2008/08/F3509195-D04E-4187-AA45-23B61ACF430F.asp \"Armenia Scrambles To Restore Vital Supplies Via Georgia\"], Armenia Liberty ([[RFE/RL]]), August 18, 2008.</ref>\n\n===Through Georgia===\nRussian natural gas reaches Armenia via a pipeline through Georgia.\n\nThe only operational rail link into Armenia is from [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].

A mosquito causes an infection by a bite. First, sporozoites enter the bloodstream, and migrate to the liver. They infect [[liver cells]], where they multiply into merozoites, rupture the liver cells, and return to the bloodstream. The merozoites infect red blood cells, where they develop into ring forms, trophozoites and schizonts that in turn produce further merozoites. [[Gametocytes|Sexual forms]] are also produced, which, if taken up by a mosquito, infects the insect and continue the life cycle.]]\n\nIn the [[Plasmodium#\u00acif cycle|life cycle]] of ''Plasmodium'', a female ''[[Anopheles]]'' mosquito (the [[host (biology)|definitive host]]) transmits a motile infective form (called the [[sporozoite]]) to a vertebrate host such as a human (the secondary host), thus acting as a transmission [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]]. A sporozoite travels through the blood vessels to liver cells ([[hepatocyte]]s), where it reproduces [[asexual reproduction|asexually]] (tissue [[schizogony]]), producing thousands of [[merozoite]]s. These infect new red blood cells and initiate a series of asexual multiplication cycles (blood schizogony) that produce 8 to 24 new infective merozoites, at which point the cells burst and the infective cycle begins anew.<ref>{{harvnb|Schlagenhauf-Lawlor|2008|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=54Dza0UHyngC&pg=PA70 70\u20131]}}</ref>\n\nOther merozoites develop into immature [[Gametocyte#Gametocytes and malaria|gametocytes]], which are the precursors of male and female [[gamete]]s. When a fertilized mosquito bites an infected person, gametocytes are taken up with the blood and mature in the mosquito gut. The male and female gametocytes fuse and form an [[ookinete]]\u2014a fertilized, motile [[zygote]]. Ookinetes develop into new sporozoites that migrate to the insect's [[salivary gland]]s, ready to infect a new vertebrate host. The sporozoites are injected into the skin, in the saliva, when the mosquito takes a subsequent blood meal.<ref name=\"Cowman 2012\"/>\n\nOnly female mosquitoes feed on blood; male mosquitoes feed on plant nectar and do not transmit the disease. Females of the mosquito genus ''Anopheles'' prefer to feed at night. They usually start searching for a meal at dusk, and continue through the night until they succeed.<ref name=\"Arrow 2004\"/> Malaria parasites can also be transmitted by [[blood transfusion]]s, although this is rare.<ref name=\"Owusu-Ofori 2010\"/>\n\n===Recurrent malaria===\nSymptoms of malaria can recur after varying symptom-free periods. Depending upon the cause, recurrence can be classified as either [[recrudescence]], [[relapse]], or reinfection. Recrudescence is when symptoms return after a symptom-free period. It is caused by parasites surviving in the blood as a result of inadequate or ineffective treatment.<ref>{{harvnb|WHO|2010|p=vi}}</ref> Relapse is when symptoms reappear after the parasites have been eliminated from blood but persist as dormant [[Plasmodium#Life cycle|hypnozoites]] in liver cells.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Markus|first1=MB|title=Malaria: Origin of the Term \"Hypnozoite\"|journal=Journal of the History of Biology|date=2011|volume=44|issue=4|pages=781\u201386|doi=10.1007/s10739-010-9239-3|pmid=20665090|url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/22a9a94fd803f97d7d145d7fa529b96a7177b8ed}}</ref> Relapse commonly occurs between 8\u201324 weeks and is often seen in ''P.&nbsp;vivax'' and ''P.&nbsp;ovale'' infections.<ref name=\"Nadjm 2012\"/> However, relapse-like ''P. vivax'' recurrences are probably being over-attributed to hypnozoite activation.

When an infected mosquito pierces a person's skin to take a blood meal, sporozoites in the mosquito's saliva enter the bloodstream and migrate to the liver where they infect hepatocytes, multiplying asexually and asymptomatically for a period of 8\u201330 days.<ref name=\"Bledsoe 2005\"/>\n\nAfter a potential dormant period in the liver, these organisms [[cellular differentiation|differentiate]] to yield thousands of merozoites, which, following rupture of their host cells, escape into the blood and infect red blood cells to begin the erythrocytic stage of the life cycle.<ref name=\"Bledsoe 2005\"/> The parasite escapes from the liver undetected by wrapping itself in the [[cell membrane]] of the infected host liver cell.<ref name=\"Vaughan 2008\"/>\n\nWithin the red blood cells, the parasites multiply further, again asexually, periodically breaking out of their host cells to invade fresh red blood cells. Several such amplification cycles occur. Thus, classical descriptions of waves of fever arise from simultaneous waves of merozoites escaping and infecting red blood cells.<ref name=\"Bledsoe 2005\"/>\n\nSome ''P.&nbsp;vivax'' sporozoites do not immediately develop into exoerythrocytic-phase merozoites, but instead, produce hypnozoites that remain dormant for periods ranging from several months (7\u201310 months is typical) to several years.<ref name=\"White 2011\"/> After a period of dormancy, they reactivate and produce merozoites. Hypnozoites are responsible for long incubation and late relapses in ''P.&nbsp;vivax'' infections,<ref name=\"White 2011\"/> although their existence in ''P.&nbsp;ovale'' is uncertain.<ref name=\"Richter 2010\"/>\n\nThe parasite is relatively protected from attack by the body's [[immune system]] because for most of its human life cycle it resides within the liver and blood cells and is relatively invisible to immune surveillance. However, circulating infected blood cells are destroyed in the [[spleen]]. To avoid this fate, the ''P.&nbsp;falciparum'' parasite displays adhesive [[protein]]s on the surface of the infected blood cells, causing the blood cells to stick to the walls of small blood vessels, thereby sequestering the parasite from passage through the general circulation and the spleen.<ref name=\"Tilley 2011\"/> The blockage of the microvasculature causes symptoms such as in placental malaria.<ref name=\"Mens 2010\"/> Sequestered red blood cells can breach the [[blood\u2013brain barrier]] and cause cerebral malaria.<ref name=\"R\u00e9nia 2012\"/>\n\n===Genetic resistance===\n{{Main|Human genetic resistance to malaria}}\nAccording to a 2005 review, due to the high levels of [[death|mortality]] and [[morbidity]] caused by malaria\u2014especially the ''P.&nbsp;falciparum'' species\u2014it has placed the greatest [[Selection (biology)|selective pressure]] on the [[human genome]] in recent history. Several genetic factors provide some resistance to it including [[sickle cell trait]], [[thalassaemia]] traits, [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency]], and the absence of [[Duffy antigen]]s on red blood cells.<ref name=\"Kwiatkowski 2005\"/><ref name=\"Hedrick 2011\"/>\n\nThe impact of sickle cell trait on malaria immunity illustrates some evolutionary trade-offs that have occurred because of endemic malaria. Sickle cell trait causes a change in the hemoglobin molecule in the blood. Normally, red blood cells have a very flexible, biconcave shape that allows them to move through narrow [[capillaries]]; however, when the modified [[hemoglobin S|hemoglobin&nbsp;S]] molecules are exposed to low amounts of oxygen, or crowd together due to dehydration, they can stick together forming strands that cause the cell to sickle or distort into a curved shape. In these strands, the molecule is not as effective in taking or releasing oxygen, and the cell is not flexible enough to circulate freely. In the early stages of malaria, the parasite can cause infected red cells to sickle, and so they are removed from circulation sooner. This reduces the frequency with which malaria parasites complete their life cycle in the cell. Individuals who are [[homozygous]] (with two copies of the abnormal hemoglobin beta [[allele]]) have [[sickle-cell anaemia]], while those who are heterozygous (with one abnormal allele and one normal allele) experience resistance to malaria without severe anemia. Although the shorter life expectancy for those with the homozygous condition would tend to disfavor the trait's survival, the trait is preserved in malaria-prone regions because of the [[heterozygote advantage|benefits]] provided by the heterozygous form.<ref name=\"Hedrick 2011\"/><ref name=\"Weatherall 2008\"/>\n\n===Liver dysfunction===\nLiver dysfunction as a result of malaria is uncommon and usually only occurs in those with another liver condition such as [[viral hepatitis]] or [[chronic liver disease]]. The syndrome is sometimes called ''malarial hepatitis''.<ref name=\"Bhalla 2006\"/> While it has been considered a rare occurrence, malarial hepatopathy has seen an increase, particularly in Southeast Asia and India.

This mosquito is a vector of malaria, and mosquito control is an effective way of reducing its incidence.]]\n\nMethods used to prevent malaria include medications, mosquito elimination and the prevention of bites. There is no [[malaria vaccine|vaccine for malaria]]. The presence of malaria in an area requires a combination of high human population density, high anopheles mosquito population density and high rates of transmission from humans to mosquitoes and from mosquitoes to humans. If any of these is lowered sufficiently, the parasite eventually disappears from that area, as happened in North America, Europe, and parts of the Middle East. However, unless the parasite is eliminated from the whole world, it could re-establish if conditions revert to a combination that favors the parasite's reproduction. Furthermore, the cost per person of eliminating anopheles mosquitoes rises with decreasing population density, making it economically unfeasible in some areas.<ref name=\"whqlibdoc\"/>\n\nPrevention of malaria may be more cost-effective than treatment of the disease in the long run, but the [[capital cost|initial costs]] required are out of reach of many of the world's poorest people. There is a wide difference in the costs of control (i.e. maintenance of low endemicity) and elimination programs between countries. For example, in China\u2014whose government in 2010 announced a strategy to pursue malaria elimination in the [[Chinese province]]s\u2014the required investment is a small proportion of public expenditure on health. In contrast, a similar program in Tanzania would cost an estimated one-fifth of the public health budget.<ref name=\"Sabot 2010\"/>\n\nIn areas where malaria is common, children under five years old often have [[anemia]], which is sometimes due to malaria.

In time, pest control, rather than disease control, came to dominate DDT use, and this large-scale agricultural use led to the evolution of [[pesticide resistance|resistant]] mosquitoes in many regions. The DDT resistance shown by ''Anopheles'' mosquitoes can be compared to [[antibiotic resistance]] shown by bacteria. During the 1960s, awareness of the negative consequences of its indiscriminate use increased, ultimately leading to bans on agricultural applications of DDT in many countries in the 1970s.<ref name=\"van den Berg 2009\"/> Before DDT, malaria was successfully eliminated or controlled in tropical areas like Brazil and Egypt by removing or poisoning the breeding grounds of the mosquitoes or the aquatic habitats of the larva stages, for example by applying the highly toxic arsenic compound [[Paris Green]] to places with standing water.<ref name=\"Killeen 2002\"/>\n\n[[Malaria vaccine]]s have been an elusive goal of research.

Vaccine candidates that target antigens on gametes, zygotes, or ookinetes in the mosquito midgut aim to block the transmission of malaria. These transmission-blocking vaccines induce antibodies in the human blood; when a mosquito takes a blood meal from a protected individual, these antibodies prevent the parasite from completing its development in the mosquito.<ref name=\"Cromptom 2010\"/> Other vaccine candidates, targeting the blood-stage of the parasite's life cycle, have been inadequate on their own.<ref name=\"Graves 2006b\"/> For example, [[Manuel Elkin Patarroyo|SPf66]] was tested extensively in areas where the disease is common in the 1990s, but trials showed it to be insufficiently effective.<ref name=\"Graves 2006\"/>\n\n===Medications===\nMalaria parasites contain [[apicoplast]]s, organelles usually found in plants, complete with their own [[genome]]s.

cyclical occurrence of sudden coldness followed by shivering and then fever and sweating, occurring every two days ([[Fever#Types|tertian fever]]) in ''P.&nbsp;vivax'' and ''P.&nbsp;ovale'' infections, and every three days ([[Fever#Types|quartan fever]]) for ''P.&nbsp;malariae''. ''P.&nbsp;falciparum'' infection can cause recurrent fever every 36\u201348 hours, or a less pronounced and almost continuous fever.<ref name=\"Ferri 2009\"/>\n\nSevere malaria is usually caused by ''P.&nbsp;falciparum'' (often referred to as falciparum malaria). Symptoms of falciparum malaria arise 9\u201330 days after infection.<ref name=\"Bartoloni 2012\"/> Individuals with cerebral malaria frequently exhibit [[neurological disorder|neurological]] symptoms, including [[abnormal posturing]], [[nystagmus]], [[conjugate gaze palsy]] (failure of the eyes to turn together in the same direction), [[opisthotonus]], [[seizure]]s, or [[coma]].<ref name=\"Bartoloni 2012\"/>\n\n===Complications===\nMalaria has several serious [[Complication (medicine)|complications]]. Among these is the development of [[respiratory distress]], which occurs in up to 25% of adults and 40% of children with severe ''P.&nbsp;falciparum'' malaria. Possible causes include respiratory compensation of [[metabolic acidosis]], noncardiogenic [[pulmonary oedema]], concomitant [[pneumonia]], and severe [[anaemia]].

A mosquito causes an infection by a bite. First, sporozoites enter the bloodstream, and migrate to the liver. They infect [[liver cells]], where they multiply into merozoites, rupture the liver cells, and return to the bloodstream. The merozoites infect red blood cells, where they develop into ring forms, trophozoites and schizonts that in turn produce further merozoites. [[Gametocytes|Sexual forms]] are also produced, which, if taken up by a mosquito, infects the insect and continue the life cycle.]]\n\nIn the [[Plasmodium#\u00acif cycle|life cycle]] of ''Plasmodium'', a female ''[[Anopheles]]'' mosquito (the [[host (biology)|definitive host]]) transmits a motile infective form (called the [[sporozoite]]) to a vertebrate host such as a human (the secondary host), thus acting as a transmission [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]]. A sporozoite travels through the blood vessels to liver cells ([[hepatocyte]]s), where it reproduces [[asexual reproduction|asexually]] (tissue [[schizogony]]), producing thousands of [[merozoite]]s. These infect new red blood cells and initiate a series of asexual multiplication cycles (blood schizogony) that produce 8 to 24 new infective merozoites, at which point the cells burst and the infective cycle begins anew.<ref>{{harvnb|Schlagenhauf-Lawlor|2008|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=54Dza0UHyngC&pg=PA70 70\u20131]}}</ref>\n\nOther merozoites develop into immature [[Gametocyte#Gametocytes and malaria|gametocytes]], which are the precursors of male and female [[gamete]]s. When a fertilized mosquito bites an infected person, gametocytes are taken up with the blood and mature in the mosquito gut. The male and female gametocytes fuse and form an [[ookinete]]\u2014a fertilized, motile [[zygote]]. Ookinetes develop into new sporozoites that migrate to the insect's [[salivary gland]]s, ready to infect a new vertebrate host. The sporozoites are injected into the skin, in the saliva, when the mosquito takes a subsequent blood meal.<ref name=\"Cowman 2012\"/>\n\nOnly female mosquitoes feed on blood; male mosquitoes feed on plant nectar and do not transmit the disease. Females of the mosquito genus ''Anopheles'' prefer to feed at night.

[[H&E stain]].

When an infected mosquito pierces a person's skin to take a blood meal, sporozoites in the mosquito's saliva enter the bloodstream and migrate to the liver where they infect hepatocytes, multiplying asexually and asymptomatically for a period of 8\u201330 days.<ref name=\"Bledsoe 2005\"/>\n\nAfter a potential dormant period in the liver, these organisms [[cellular differentiation|differentiate]] to yield thousands of merozoites, which, following rupture of their host cells, escape into the blood and infect red blood cells to begin the erythrocytic stage of the life cycle.<ref name=\"Bledsoe 2005\"/> The parasite escapes from the liver undetected by wrapping itself in the [[cell membrane]] of the infected host liver cell.<ref name=\"Vaughan 2008\"/>\n\nWithin the red blood cells, the parasites multiply further, again asexually, periodically breaking out of their host cells to invade fresh red blood cells. Several such amplification cycles occur. Thus, classical descriptions of waves of fever arise from simultaneous waves of merozoites escaping and infecting red blood cells.<ref name=\"Bledsoe 2005\"/>\n\nSome ''P.&nbsp;vivax'' sporozoites do not immediately develop into exoerythrocytic-phase merozoites, but instead, produce hypnozoites that remain dormant for periods ranging from several months (7\u201310 months is typical) to several years.<ref name=\"White 2011\"/> After a period of dormancy, they reactivate and produce merozoites. Hypnozoites are responsible for long incubation and late relapses in ''P.&nbsp;vivax'' infections,<ref name=\"White 2011\"/> although their existence in ''P.&nbsp;ovale'' is uncertain.<ref name=\"Richter 2010\"/>\n\nThe parasite is relatively protected from attack by the body's [[immune system]] because for most of its human life cycle it resides within the liver and blood cells and is relatively invisible to immune surveillance. However, circulating infected blood cells are destroyed in the [[spleen]]. To avoid this fate, the ''P.&nbsp;falciparum'' parasite displays adhesive [[protein]]s on the surface of the infected blood cells, causing the blood cells to stick to the walls of small blood vessels, thereby sequestering the parasite from passage through the general circulation and the spleen.<ref name=\"Tilley 2011\"/> The blockage of the microvasculature causes symptoms such as in placental malaria.<ref name=\"Mens 2010\"/> Sequestered red blood cells can breach the [[blood\u2013brain barrier]] and cause cerebral malaria.<ref name=\"R\u00e9nia 2012\"/>\n\n===Genetic resistance===\n{{Main|Human genetic resistance to malaria}}\nAccording to a 2005 review, due to the high levels of [[death|mortality]] and [[morbidity]] caused by malaria\u2014especially the ''P.&nbsp;falciparum'' species\u2014it has placed the greatest [[Selection (biology)|selective pressure]] on the [[human genome]] in recent history. Several genetic factors provide some resistance to it including [[sickle cell trait]], [[thalassaemia]] traits, [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency]], and the absence of [[Duffy antigen]]s on red blood cells.<ref name=\"Kwiatkowski 2005\"/><ref name=\"Hedrick 2011\"/>\n\nThe impact of sickle cell trait on malaria immunity illustrates some evolutionary trade-offs that have occurred because of endemic malaria. Sickle cell trait causes a change in the hemoglobin molecule in the blood. Normally, red blood cells have a very flexible, biconcave shape that allows them to move through narrow [[capillaries]]; however, when the modified [[hemoglobin S|hemoglobin&nbsp;S]] molecules are exposed to low amounts of oxygen, or crowd together due to dehydration, they can stick together forming strands that cause the cell to sickle or distort into a curved shape. In these strands, the molecule is not as effective in taking or releasing oxygen, and the cell is not flexible enough to circulate freely. In the early stages of malaria, the parasite can cause infected red cells to sickle, and so they are removed from circulation sooner. This reduces the frequency with which malaria parasites complete their life cycle in the cell. Individuals who are [[homozygous]] (with two copies of the abnormal hemoglobin beta [[allele]]) have [[sickle-cell anaemia]], while those who are heterozygous (with one abnormal allele and one normal allele) experience resistance to malaria without severe anemia. Although the shorter life expectancy for those with the homozygous condition would tend to disfavor the trait's survival, the trait is preserved in malaria-prone regions because of the [[heterozygote advantage|benefits]] provided by the heterozygous form.<ref name=\"Hedrick 2011\"/><ref name=\"Weatherall 2008\"/>\n\n===Liver dysfunction===\nLiver dysfunction as a result of malaria is uncommon and usually only occurs in those with another liver condition such as [[viral hepatitis]] or [[chronic liver disease]]. The syndrome is sometimes called ''malarial hepatitis''.<ref name=\"Bhalla 2006\"/> While it has been considered a rare occurrence, malarial hepatopathy has seen an increase, particularly in Southeast Asia and India.

The [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitivity]] of blood films ranges from 75\u201390% in optimum conditions, to as low as 50%.

This mosquito is a vector of malaria, and mosquito control is an effective way of reducing its incidence.]]\n\nMethods used to prevent malaria include medications, mosquito elimination and the prevention of bites. There is no [[malaria vaccine|vaccine for malaria]]. The presence of malaria in an area requires a combination of high human population density, high anopheles mosquito population density and high rates of transmission from humans to mosquitoes and from mosquitoes to humans. If any of these is lowered sufficiently, the parasite eventually disappears from that area, as happened in North America, Europe, and parts of the Middle East. However, unless the parasite is eliminated from the whole world, it could re-establish if conditions revert to a combination that favors the parasite's reproduction. Furthermore, the cost per person of eliminating anopheles mosquitoes rises with decreasing population density, making it economically unfeasible in some areas.<ref name=\"whqlibdoc\"/>\n\nPrevention of malaria may be more cost-effective than treatment of the disease in the long run, but the [[capital cost|initial costs]] required are out of reach of many of the world's poorest people. There is a wide difference in the costs of control (i.e. maintenance of low endemicity) and elimination programs between countries. For example, in China\u2014whose government in 2010 announced a strategy to pursue malaria elimination in the [[Chinese province]]s\u2014the required investment is a small proportion of public expenditure on health. In contrast, a similar program in Tanzania would cost an estimated one-fifth of the public health budget.<ref name=\"Sabot 2010\"/>\n\nIn areas where malaria is common, children under five years old often have [[anemia]], which is sometimes due to malaria.

He isolated malaria parasites from the salivary glands of mosquitoes that had fed on infected birds.<ref name=\":1\" /> For this work, Ross received the 1902 Nobel Prize in Medicine. After resigning from the [[Indian Medical Service]], Ross worked at the newly established [[Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine]] and directed malaria-control efforts in [[Egypt]], [[Panama]], [[Greece]] and [[Mauritius]].<ref name=\"CDC Ross\"/> The findings of Finlay and Ross were later confirmed by a medical board headed by [[Walter Reed]] in 1900.

This tree grows on the slopes of the [[Andes]], mainly in [[Peru]]. The [[indigenous peoples of Peru]] made a [[tincture]] of cinchona to control fever. Its effectiveness against malaria was found and the [[Jesuit]]s introduced the treatment to Europe around 1640; by 1677, it was included in the [[London Pharmacopoeia]] as an antimalarial treatment.<ref name=\"Kaufman 2005\"/> It was not until 1820 that the active ingredient, quinine, was extracted from the bark, isolated and named by the French chemists [[Pierre Joseph Pelletier]] and [[Joseph Bienaim\u00e9 Caventou]].<ref name=\"Pelletier 1820\"/><ref name=\"Kyle 1974\"/>\n\nQuinine was the predominant malarial medication until the 1920s when other medications began to appear.

The technique was dangerous, killing about 15% of patients, so it is no longer in use.<ref name=\"Vogel 2013\"/>\n\n[[File:GuadMarinesMalaria.gif|thumb|U.S. Marines with malaria in a field hospital on [[Guadalcanal]], October 1942]]\n\nThe first pesticide used for indoor residual spraying was [[DDT]].<ref name=\"CDC history\"/> Although it was initially used exclusively to combat malaria, its use quickly spread to [[agriculture]]. In time, pest control, rather than disease control, came to dominate DDT use, and this large-scale agricultural use led to the evolution of [[pesticide resistance|resistant]] mosquitoes in many regions. The DDT resistance shown by ''Anopheles'' mosquitoes can be compared to [[antibiotic resistance]] shown by bacteria. During the 1960s, awareness of the negative consequences of its indiscriminate use increased, ultimately leading to bans on agricultural applications of DDT in many countries in the 1970s.<ref name=\"van den Berg 2009\"/> Before DDT, malaria was successfully eliminated or controlled in tropical areas like Brazil and Egypt by removing or poisoning the breeding grounds of the mosquitoes or the aquatic habitats of the larva stages, for example by applying the highly toxic arsenic compound [[Paris Green]] to places with standing water.<ref name=\"Killeen 2002\"/>\n\n[[Malaria vaccine]]s have been an elusive goal of research. The first promising studies demonstrating the potential for a malaria vaccine were performed in 1967 by immunizing mice with live, radiation-[[Attenuator (genetics)|attenuated]] sporozoites, which provided significant protection to the mice upon subsequent injection with normal, viable sporozoites. Since the 1970s, there has been a considerable effort to develop similar vaccination strategies for humans.<ref name=\"Vanderberg 2009\"/> The first vaccine, called [[RTS,S]], was approved by European regulators in 2015.<ref name=\"Walsh2015\"/>\n\n==Society and culture==\n{{see also|World Malaria Day}}\n\n=== Economic impact ===\n[[File:Saving Lives with SMS for Life.jpg|thumb|right|Malaria clinic in Tanzania]]\n\nMalaria is not just a disease commonly associated with poverty: some evidence suggests that it is also a cause of poverty and a major hindrance to [[economic development]].<ref name=\"IftSoL\"/><ref name=\"Worrall 2005\"/> Although tropical regions are most affected, malaria's furthest influence reaches into some temperate zones that have extreme seasonal changes. The disease has been associated with major negative economic effects on regions where it is widespread. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it was a major factor in the slow economic development of the American southern states.<ref name=\"Humphreys 2001\"/>\n\nA comparison of average per capita [[GDP]] in 1995, adjusted for [[purchasing power parity|parity of purchasing power]], between countries with malaria and countries without malaria gives a fivefold difference (US$1,526 versus US$8,268). In the period 1965 to 1990, countries where malaria was common had an average per capita GDP that increased only 0.4% per year, compared to 2.4% per year in other countries.<ref name=\"Sachs 2002\"/>\n\nPoverty can increase the risk of malaria since those in poverty do not have the financial capacities to prevent or treat the disease. In its entirety, the economic impact of malaria has been estimated to cost Africa US$12 billion every year. The economic impact includes costs of health care, working days lost due to sickness, days lost in education, decreased productivity due to brain damage from cerebral malaria, and loss of investment and tourism.<ref name=\"Greenwood 2005\"/> The disease has a heavy burden in some countries, where it may be responsible for 30\u201350% of hospital admissions, up to 50% of [[outpatient]] visits, and up to 40% of public health spending.<ref name=\"Roll Back Malaria WHO\"/>\n\n[[File:Malaria Patient, Nyangaton, Ethiopia (15151075077).jpg|thumb|Child with malaria in [[Ethiopia]]]]\nCerebral malaria is one of the leading causes of neurological disabilities in African children.<ref name=\"Idro 2010\"/> Studies comparing cognitive functions before and after treatment for severe malarial illness continued to show significantly impaired school performance and cognitive abilities even after recovery.<ref name=\"Fernando 2010\"/> Consequently, severe and cerebral malaria have far-reaching [[socioeconomic]] consequences that extend beyond the immediate effects of the disease.<ref name=\"Ricci 2012\"/>\n\n===Counterfeit and substandard drugs===\nSophisticated [[counterfeit drugs|counterfeits]] have been found in several Asian countries such as [[Cambodia]],<ref name=\"Lon 2006\"/> [[People's Republic of China|China]],<ref name=\"Newton 2008\"/> [[Indonesia]], [[Laos]], [[Thailand]], and [[Vietnam]], and are an important cause of avoidable death in those countries.<ref name=\"Newton 2006\"/> The WHO said that studies indicate that up to 40% of artesunate-based malaria medications are counterfeit, especially in the Greater [[Mekong]] region. They have established a rapid alert system to rapidly report information about counterfeit drugs to relevant authorities in participating countries.<ref name=\"Parry 2005\"/> There is no reliable way for doctors or lay people to detect counterfeit drugs without help from a laboratory. Companies are attempting to combat the persistence of counterfeit drugs by using new technology to provide security from source to distribution.<ref name=\"Gautam 2009\"/>\n\nAnother clinical and public health concern is the proliferation of substandard antimalarial medicines resulting from inappropriate concentration of ingredients, contamination with other drugs or toxic impurities, poor quality ingredients, poor stability and inadequate packaging.<ref name=\"Caudron 2008\"/> A 2012 study demonstrated that roughly one-third of antimalarial medications in Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa failed chemical analysis, packaging analysis, or were falsified.<ref name=\"Nayyar 2012\"/>\n\n===War===\n[[File:\"Don't go to Bed with Malaria Mosquito\" - NARA - 514146.tif|thumb|right|World War II poster]]\nThroughout history, the contraction of malaria has played a prominent role in the fates of government rulers, nation-states, military personnel, and military actions.<ref name=\"Russell 2009\"/> In 1910, [[Nobel Prize in Medicine]]-winner Ronald Ross (himself a malaria survivor), published a book titled ''The Prevention of Malaria'' that included a chapter titled \"The Prevention of Malaria in War.\" The chapter's author, Colonel C.

During [[World War I]] and World War II, inconsistent supplies of the natural anti-malaria drugs [[cinchona bark]] and quinine prompted substantial funding into [[research and development]] of other drugs and vaccines. American military organizations conducting such research initiatives include the Navy Medical Research Center, [[Walter Reed Army Institute of Research]], and the [[U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases]] of the US Armed Forces.<ref name=\"malariasite1\"/>\n\nAdditionally, initiatives have been founded such as Malaria Control in War Areas (MCWA), established in 1942, and its successor, the Communicable Disease Center (now known as the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], or CDC) established in 1946.

Vaccine candidates that target antigens on gametes, zygotes, or ookinetes in the mosquito midgut aim to block the transmission of malaria. These transmission-blocking vaccines induce antibodies in the human blood; when a mosquito takes a blood meal from a protected individual, these antibodies prevent the parasite from completing its development in the mosquito.<ref name=\"Cromptom 2010\"/> Other vaccine candidates, targeting the blood-stage of the parasite's life cycle, have been inadequate on their own.<ref name=\"Graves 2006b\"/> For example, [[Manuel Elkin Patarroyo|SPf66]] was tested extensively in areas where the disease is common in the 1990s, but trials showed it to be insufficiently effective.<ref name=\"Graves 2006\"/>\n\n===Medications===\nMalaria parasites contain [[apicoplast]]s, organelles usually found in plants, complete with their own [[genome]]s.

Whittock was also accused of having coughed after Ingram mentioned an incorrect option to his penultimate question and swiftly following that up with a smothered \"No\". However, Plaskett, who had sat in that very same seat, argued that he might have audibly said it in response to an incorrect option in the same way that other waiting contestants have been known to whisper \"No\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/jul/17/couldthewhowantstobeami|title=Are the Millionaire three innocent?|last=Ronson|first=Jon|date=17 July 2006|work=The Guardian|accessdate=17 August 2014|location=London}}</ref>\n\n====Recorded evidence====\nIn court, Ingram claimed the videotape of his appearance on ''Millionaire'' was \"unrepresentative of what I heard\", and he continues to assert that it was \"unfairly manipulated\". A video recording, with coughing amplified relative to other sounds including Ingram's and Tarrant's voices, was prepared by Celador's editors (Editworks) for the prosecution and \"for the benefit of the jury\" during the trial (and later for viewers in television broadcasts). Ingram claims that he neither \"listened for, encouraged, nor noticed any coughing\". The prosecution alleged that, of the 192 coughs recorded during his second-night performance, 32 were recorded from the ten Fastest Finger First contestants, and that 19 of the 32 coughs heard on the video tape were \"significant\". The prosecution asserted that these \"significant\" coughs were by Whittock, when the correct answer had been spoken. During the trial, Tarrant also denied hearing any coughing throughout the episode, claiming he was too busy to notice.<ref name=\"scotsman\">{{cite news |url=https://www.scotsman.com/news/uk-news/quizmaster-amazed-to-hear-163-1m-winner-could-have-cheated-1-598995 |title=Quizmaster 'amazed' to hear \u00a31m winner could have cheated |date=13 March 2003 |accessdate=13 May 2008 |location=Edinburgh |work=The Scotsman |first=Karen |last=Mcveigh}}</ref>\n\n====Testimony of Larry Whitehurst====\nLarry Whitehurst, another contestant who had appeared on the show as a Fastest Finger First contestant on four occasions, was adamant that he had known the answers to Ingram's questions.

Ingram had failed to tell [[Direct Line]] Insurance about claims he had made in the three years before he took out the policy in July 2001.
