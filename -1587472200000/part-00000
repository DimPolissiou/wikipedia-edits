His first vessel demonstrates his trademark: originality and high-quality. Friedrich L\u00fcrssen's shipyard grows and thrives, and at one point he even begins placing orders with his father.\n\n11 years later, in 1886, L\u00fcrssen builds the world's first motorboat. The 6-meter REMS is commissioned by the inventor and engine manufacturer [[Gottlieb Daimler]], who needs a boat to put his new engine through its paces. Friedrich L\u00fcrssen, always open to new ideas, designs and builds it without delay. The [[Daimler AG|Daimler]] engine that powers it has a cylinder capacity of 0.462 liters, weighs 60 kilograms, and has an output 1.5&nbsp;hp at 700 rpm. In 1907, Friedrich L\u00fcrssen's only son, Otto, joins the firm as a partner.\n\nFour years later the L\u00fcrssen-Daimler speedboat with its 102&nbsp;hp engine becomes the sensation of the racing season. In the Mediterranean off [[Monaco]], it wins the unofficial world championship, the ''Championship of the Sea''. The speedboat goes on to win the ''Prix de la Cote d\u00b4Azur'' and the [[Grand Prix des Nations]] later in the same year.\n\n'''1916''': The company that is his life's work has grown into a leading German [[shipyard]], when Friedrich L\u00fcrssen dies at the age of 65. He could not have wished for the firm he had founded 41 years earlier to develop more successfully. A year after Friedrich L\u00fcrssen's death, the [[German Navy|German navy]] started using remote-controlled boats to enter occupied ports or attacking heavily armored ships. These boats were co-developed and built by L\u00fcrssen.\n\n=== A new start ===\n1925 is a special year for L\u00fcrssen. They launched their 10,000th vessel, a 14-meter wooden motoryacht, a sister ship of the '''''Onkel Fidi''''', and in addition, the company celebrates its 50th anniversary. Two years later they set another standard. With '''''[[Oheka II]]''''', equipped with three [[Maybach]] engines that propel her to a top speed of 34 knots, L\u00fcrssen builds the world's fastest commuter yacht. Later the same year, the company also builds the world's longest and heaviest motoryacht: the 36-meter AAR IV weighs 130 metric tons.\n\n1932: The abrupt death of 52 year-old Otto L\u00fcrssen. His wife, Frieda L\u00fcrssen, the daughter of a captain of a large cruise ship, takes over the L\u00fcrssen yard.\n\nSix years later, the third generation takes on more and more responsibility at L\u00fcrssen: Gert L\u00fcrssen comes on board - bringing along the passion of motorboats he inherited from his father. In 1939, he sets a world speed record on the lower reaches of the Weser River in a L\u00fcrssen diesel-powered speedboat. It achieves a speed of exactly 68.2&nbsp;km/h.\nThe same year, [[torpedo boats]] are delivered to [[Bulgaria]] The 35-meter vessels carry the forward-mounted torpedo tubes better and no longer have the tendency to dive in heavy seas, as was the case with previous models.\n\nBusiness is difficult in the wake of the war. Everyone has to start from scratch and the L\u00fcrssen shipyard is no exception. During this time of change, the brothers Gert and Fritz-Otto L\u00fcrssen agree on the division of shares in the company, which they hold from then on jointly with their mother Frieda L\u00fcrssen. In the postwar period L\u00fcrssen sets a new standard for fast [[patrol boat]]s. They launched the '''Jaguar''' in 1959, especially developed for the German Navy. At 42 meters, the ships are larger than those built during WWII. They serve as a model for future fast patrol boat designs.\n\nIn 1962 Frieda L\u00fcrssen decides to hand over the responsibility of the firm to her sons Gert & Fritz-Otto. That same year, the 55-meter yacht '''''Pegasus II''''' is delivered, like her predecessor, to a London shipowner.\n\n1971: the yacht '''''Carinthia VI''''' is designed by [[Jon Bannenberg]] - his first major yacht project. To this day, the 71-meter vessel remains contemporary in styling, and she can be seen as the precursor of today's L\u00fcrssen yachts.\n\nAt the age of only 63 years Fritz-Otto L\u00fcrssen dies unexpectedly, abruptly ending the successful collaboration between the brothers Gert and Fritz-Otto L\u00fcrssen. A quote from one of the eulogies at his funeral reflects his popularity:  ''\"For us employees, he was an entrepreneur and a boss, someone you could talk to and negotiate with, a friend and advisor\".'' A couple of years later his brother, Gert L\u00fcrssen, decides to withdraw from active company leadership. He hands over the management responsibilities to his son, Friedrich.In that same year, 1977, L\u00fcrssen delivers the first vessel in the series to the [[Turkish navy]]. Three other ships are built at a partner shipyard in [[Turkey]] using material packages. A total of ten 57-meter ''Dogan-type'' ships are built.\n\nIn 1987 Peter L\u00fcrssen joins the company - after studying shipbuilding and industrial engineering in Germany and business administration in the United States as well as gathering considerable professional experience. In previous positions, he spent a year as a building inspector at different Japanese shipyards, and already familiarized himself with various L\u00fcrssen departments.\n\nIn 1988 L\u00fcrssen decides to add a new division. Currently the shipyards are operating at 90% capacity with navy contracts but the company decides to split the production between the [[naval ship]]s and the [[luxury yacht]]s. From now on, the company devotes half of its production capacity to the building of large yachts. In 1991 the yacht '''''Be Mine''''' is completed, one of the first yachts to be designed and built entirely under the direction of the newly established independent L\u00fcrssen yachtbuilding division. She goes on to win the prestigious ''International Superyacht Society Design Award'' as well as the ''Superyacht of the Year Award''.\nAt this time the ''corvette Victory'' is delivered to the [[Singaporean Navy]] as the leading ship in a class of six corvettes. Due to its stealth design, the ship is difficult for enemy vessels to detect. It is also characterized by low underwater noise emissions.\n\nAfter playing a defining role in the company's progress for half a century, senior partner Gert L\u00fcrssen dies on January 2 at the age of 77. This comes at a time when Germany is cutting back its defence spending in response to the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. The new yachtbuilding division becomes more important for the company.\n\nIn 1990, the [[United Arab Emirates]] receive two complex naval vessels from the '''Murray JIB class''' equipped with helicopter landing pads and with an extensive array of weapon systems and sensor technology, not usual for ships of this size.\n\nEight years later, the [[K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7-class fast attack craft|'''''Kili\u00e7''''']], with a total length of 62 meters is delivered to the [[Turkish Navy]]. This [[corvette]] has modern weapons and fire control systems integrated. The seafaring qualities of the new enlarged ship have been considerably improved. Also the ''Indonesian customs authorities'' have ordered five patrol boats with a top speed of 40 knots and ten with a top speed of 50 knots.\n\n2000: One-and-a-quarter centuries after its founding by Friedrich L\u00fcrssen, the company celebrates an important anniversary. The small boatbuilding company on the [[Weser|Weser River]] has grown into a large shipyard that builds military vessels as well as modern megayachts.\nL\u00fcrssen delivered the ''Berlin'', one of the key task force vessels, to the German Navy. This highly important vessel type ensures the ability of the entire fleet to perform in action.\n\nIn 2002: thirty years after '''''Carinthia VI''''' set new standards, '''''[[Carinthia VII]]''''', at a length overall of 97 meters, is delivered. A year later, the superyacht [[Pelorus (yacht)|'''Pelorus''']], designed by Tim Heywood is delivered. With its overall length of 115 meters it is one of the world's largest private yachts.\n\nIn 2005 the 90 meter yacht [[Ice (yacht)|ICE]] is delivered. It is the first yacht to be equipped with a compact '''Azipod''' drive system. This ultralow noise- and vibration propulsion system is especially effective in fulfilling the owner's demands in terms of ecological operations.\n\nA couple of years later, the last of a total of six minehunters are handed over to the ''Turkish Navy'' in cooperation with the consortium partner '''Abeking & Rasmussen.'''\nFrom 2010 on, also ''[[Brunei]]'' started sending orders to L\u00fcrssen for patrol boats and offshore vessels.\n\n=== Current situation ===\nIn 2012, two of the world's top designers get involved in the construction of the 147.25 meter yacht '''[[Topaz (yacht)|Topaz]]''': [[Tim Heywood]]; and ''Terence Disdale'' was responsible for her interior.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nIn 2013 L\u00fcrssen delivers '''[[Azzam (2013 yacht)|Azzam]]''', the longest yacht in the world. She not only sets a record with regards to her length of 180 meters and speed of more than 30 knots but also her building time of less than three years is record-breaking.{{cn|date=March 2020}} In 2016 L\u00fcrssen launched the 156 meter long yacht '''[[Dilbar (yacht)|Dilbar]]'''. The yacht, with a width of more than 23 meters is the biggest yacht in the world in terms of gross tonnage (over 15,900 GT).\n\nL\u00fcrssen acquired shipbuilding company [[Blohm + Voss]] in a long-term partnership.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.superyachttimes.com/yacht-news/breaking-news-a-new-future-for-luerssen/ |title=Breaking news: L\u00fcrssen acquires Blohm + Voss |publisher=superyachttimes.com |date=28 September 2016 |accessdate=28 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn 1 March 2018, a German consortium consisting of [[ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems|Thyssen Krupp]] and Luerssen is excluded by the German Government from the tender for the construction of the multi-purpose warship MKS 180 for the benefit of GNY ([[German Naval Yards Holdings|German Naval Yards]]), belonging to the Prinvinvest group, and the Dutch shipbuilder [[Damen Group|Damen]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.handelsblatt.com/my/unternehmen/industrie/thyssen-krupp-und-luerssen-deutsche-werften-gehen-bei-grossauftrag-der-marine-leer-aus/21021588.html|title=Deutsche Werften gehen bei Gro\u00dfauftrag der Marine leer aus|last=Murphy|first=Martin|date=March 1, 2018|website=Handelsblatt.com|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nOn 14 September 2018, a [[fire]] broke out in the floating dock, burning the under construction Structure of the 146 m long yacht project ''Sassi''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.superyachttimes.com/yacht-news/fire-breaks-out-at-lurssen-shipyard-in-bremen|title=L\u00fcrssen shipyard fire under control|date=September 16, 2018|website=superyachttimes.com|access-date=September 16, 2018}}</ref>\n\n== The company ==\n\n=== Locations ===\n* [[Bremen-Vegesack|'''Vegesack''']]: L\u00fcrssen Vegeack has been the hub of operations since 1918.

His first vessel demonstrates his trademark: originality and high-quality. Friedrich L\u00fcrssen's shipyard grows and thrives, and at one point he even begins placing orders with his father.\n\n11 years later, in 1886, L\u00fcrssen builds the world's first motorboat. The 6-meter REMS is commissioned by the inventor and engine manufacturer [[Gottlieb Daimler]], who needs a boat to put his new engine through its paces. Friedrich L\u00fcrssen, always open to new ideas, designs and builds it without delay. The [[Daimler AG|Daimler]] engine that powers it has a cylinder capacity of 0.462 liters, weighs 60 kilograms, and has an output 1.5&nbsp;hp at 700 rpm. In 1907, Friedrich L\u00fcrssen's only son, Otto, joins the firm as a partner.\n\nFour years later the L\u00fcrssen-Daimler speedboat with its 102&nbsp;hp engine becomes the sensation of the racing season. In the Mediterranean off [[Monaco]], it wins the unofficial world championship, the ''Championship of the Sea''. The speedboat goes on to win the ''Prix de la Cote d\u00b4Azur'' and the [[Grand Prix des Nations]] later in the same year.\n\n'''1916''': The company that is his life's work has grown into a leading German [[shipyard]], when Friedrich L\u00fcrssen dies at the age of 65. He could not have wished for the firm he had founded 41 years earlier to develop more successfully. A year after Friedrich L\u00fcrssen's death, the [[German Navy|German navy]] started using remote-controlled boats to enter occupied ports or attacking heavily armored ships. These boats were co-developed and built by L\u00fcrssen.\n\n=== A new start ===\n1925 is a special year for L\u00fcrssen. They launched their 10,000th vessel, a 14-meter wooden motoryacht, a sister ship of the '''''Onkel Fidi''''', and in addition, the company celebrates its 50th anniversary. Two years later they set another standard. With '''''[[Oheka II]]''''', equipped with three [[Maybach]] engines that propel her to a top speed of 34 knots, L\u00fcrssen builds the world's fastest commuter yacht. Later the same year, the company also builds the world's longest and heaviest motoryacht: the 36-meter AAR IV weighs 130 metric tons.\n\n1932: The abrupt death of 52 year-old Otto L\u00fcrssen. His wife, Frieda L\u00fcrssen, the daughter of a captain of a large cruise ship, takes over the L\u00fcrssen yard.\n\nSix years later, the third generation takes on more and more responsibility at L\u00fcrssen: Gert L\u00fcrssen comes on board - bringing along the passion of motorboats he inherited from his father.

It achieves a speed of exactly 68.2&nbsp;km/h.\nThe same year, [[torpedo boats]] are delivered to [[Bulgaria]] The 35-meter vessels carry the forward-mounted torpedo tubes better and no longer have the tendency to dive in heavy seas, as was the case with previous models.\n\nBusiness is difficult in the wake of the war. Everyone has to start from scratch and the L\u00fcrssen shipyard is no exception.
