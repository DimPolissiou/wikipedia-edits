The cathedral city is [[Kristiansand]], Norway's fifth largest city. [[Kristiansand Cathedral]] serves as the seat of the presiding Bishop. The bishop since 2013 has been [[Stein Reinertsen]].  As of 1 January 2003, there were 347,324 members of the Church of Norway in the diocese.\n\n==History==\nIn 1125, the southern part of the [[Ancient Diocese of Bergen]] was split off as the [[Ancient Diocese of Stavanger]]. This new diocese stretched from the coast of [[Haugesund]] in the west to [[Gjernestangen]] between [[Ris\u00f8r]] and [[Krager\u00f8]], later the border stretched to [[Eidanger]] in the east. [[Stavanger]] was the [[cathedral]] city.  During the [[Protestant Reformation]], Norway became a Lutheran nation, establishing the [[Church of Norway]].  The diocesan boundaries remained the same.\n\nOver time, however, the diocese was reduced in size.  The parish of Eidfjord was transferred to the neighboring [[Diocese of Bj\u00f8rgvin]] in 1630. The regions of Valdres and Hallingdal were transferred to the [[Diocese of Oslo]] in 1631, but in exchange, the Diocese of Oslo had to give the upper part of [[Telemark]] and transfer that to the Diocese of Stavanger.<ref name=\"snl\" />\n\nIn 1682 [[Christian V]], King of [[Denmark-Norway]], issued an order that the Bishop and the Prefect of the Diocese of Stavanger were to be moved to the [[Kristiansand Cathedral|Christianssand Cathedral]], which had been consecrated in 1646 and which the King intended be perfect site for a new cathedral. The citizens of Stavanger protested, with the Prefect and the Bishop refusing to move and ignoring the order. It took two years before Christianssand was established as the new cathedral city. The diocese was renamed [[Diocese of Agder|Diocese of Christianssand]] ({{lang-no|\"Christiansands stift\"}}).<ref name=\"snl\" />\n\nOn 1 January 1925, the Diocese of Kristiansand was divided and all of the diocese located in [[Rogaland]] county was moved to the newly re-established [[Diocese of Stavanger]] and the [[Stavanger Cathedral]] regained its place as the seat of a bishop.  The Diocese of Agder continued to serve the counties of [[Aust-Agder]], [[Vest-Agder]], and [[Telemark]], although its name \"Diocese of Agder\" continued to be used until 2005 when the name \"Telemark\" was added to fully reflect the areas included in the diocese.<ref name=\"snl\" />\n\n==Kristiansand Cathedral==\n{{main|Kristiansand Cathedral}}\n[[Kristiansand Cathedral]] is the headquarters of the Diocese of Agder and Telemark and it is the main parish church for the city of [[Kristiansand]]. In 1682, there was a small church built of wood on site in Kristiansand. A new cathedral was built of stone and consecrated by Bishop [[Hans Munch (bishop)|Hans Munch]] in 1696, but burned down in 1734. The city's second cathedral was consecrated in 1738 by Bishop [[Jacob K\u00e6rup]]. This cathedral was destroyed in the city fire of 1880.\n\nThe present church is the third cathedral in the city and the fourth church in the town square in Kristiansand. The church was built after a drawing by the architect [[Henrik Thrap-Meyer]]. The church is described as [[neo-gothic]] style. The building is {{convert|70|m}} long and {{convert|39|m}} wide, and the tower is {{convert|70|m}} high.

The cathedral city is [[Kristiansand]], Norway's fifth largest city. [[Kristiansand Cathedral]] serves as the seat of the presiding Bishop. The bishop since 2013 has been [[Stein Reinertsen]].  As of 1 January 2003, there were 347,324 members of the Church of Norway in the diocese.\n\n==History==\nIn 1125, the southern part of the [[Ancient Diocese of Bergen]] was split off as the [[Ancient Diocese of Stavanger]]. This new diocese stretched from the coast of [[Haugesund]] in the west to [[Gjernestangen]] between [[Ris\u00f8r]] and [[Krager\u00f8]], later the border stretched to [[Eidanger]] in the east. [[Stavanger]] was the [[cathedral]] city.  During the [[Protestant Reformation]], Norway became a Lutheran nation, establishing the [[Church of Norway]].  The diocesan boundaries remained the same.\n\nOver time, however, the diocese was reduced in size.  The parish of Eidfjord was transferred to the neighboring [[Diocese of Bj\u00f8rgvin]] in 1630. The regions of Valdres and Hallingdal were transferred to the [[Diocese of Oslo]] in 1631, but in exchange, the Diocese of Oslo had to give the upper part of [[Telemark]] and transfer that to the Diocese of Stavanger.<ref name=\"snl\" />\n\nIn 1682 [[Christian V]], King of [[Denmark-Norway]], issued an order that the Bishop and the Prefect of the Diocese of Stavanger were to be moved to the [[Kristiansand Cathedral|Christianssand Cathedral]], which had been consecrated in 1646 and which the King intended be perfect site for a new cathedral. The citizens of Stavanger protested, with the Prefect and the Bishop refusing to move and ignoring the order. It took two years before Christianssand was established as the new cathedral city. The diocese was renamed [[Diocese of Agder|Diocese of Christianssand]] ({{lang-no|\"Christiansands stift\"}}).<ref name=\"snl\" />\n\nOn 1 January 1925, the Diocese of Kristiansand was divided and all of the diocese located in [[Rogaland]] county was moved to the newly re-established [[Diocese of Stavanger]] and the [[Stavanger Cathedral]] regained its place as the seat of a bishop.  The Diocese of Agder continued to serve the counties of [[Aust-Agder]], [[Vest-Agder]], and [[Telemark]], although its name \"Diocese of Agder\" continued to be used until 2005 when the name \"Telemark\" was added to fully reflect the areas included in the diocese.<ref name=\"snl\" />\n\n==Kristiansand Cathedral==\n{{main|Kristiansand Cathedral}}\n[[Kristiansand Cathedral]] is the headquarters of the Diocese of Agder and Telemark and it is the main parish church for the city of [[Kristiansand]]. In 1682, there was a small church built of wood on site in Kristiansand. A new cathedral was built of stone and consecrated by Bishop [[Hans Munch (bishop)|Hans Munch]] in 1696, but burned down in 1734. The city's second cathedral was consecrated in 1738 by Bishop [[Jacob K\u00e6rup]]. This cathedral was destroyed in the city fire of 1880.\n\nThe present church is the third cathedral in the city and the fourth church in the town square in Kristiansand. The church was built after a drawing by the architect [[Henrik Thrap-Meyer]]. The church is described as [[neo-gothic]] style. The building is {{convert|70|m}} long and {{convert|39|m}} wide, and the tower is {{convert|70|m}} high. The Cathedral has a beautiful wooden ceiling and six beautiful stained glass windows with Biblical themes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pinoybro.com/index.php/travel/travel-blog/521-kristiansand-cathedral|title=Kristiansand Cathedral|publisher=PinoyBro|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520065359/http://www.pinoybro.com/index.php/travel/travel-blog/521-kristiansand-cathedral|archivedate=2011-05-20}}</ref>\n\nIn order to exploit the ancient walls of the church that burned in 1880, the altar was placed against the west, while the churches generally tend to have the altar in the east.

Phrases such as ''Strip Area'', ''Resort Corridor'' or ''Resort District'' are sometimes used to indicate a larger geographical area, including properties {{convert|1|mi|km}} or more away from Las Vegas Boulevard, such as the [[Westgate Las Vegas]], [[Hard Rock Hotel and Casino (Las Vegas)|Hard Rock]], [[Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino|Rio]], [[Palms Casino Resort|Palms]], and [[Oyo Hotel & Casino|Oyo]] resorts.\n\nThe [[Sahara Las Vegas|Sahara]] is widely considered the Strip's northern terminus, though travel guides typically extend it to the [[Stratosphere Las Vegas|Stratosphere]] {{convert|0.4|mi|km}} to the north. [[Mandalay Bay]], just north of Russell Road, is the southernmost resort considered to be on the Strip (the [[Klondike Hotel and Casino|Klondike]] was the southernmost until 2006, when it was closed, although it was not included in the Strip on some definitions and travel guides). The \"Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas\" sign is often considered part of the Strip, although it sits 0.4 miles south of the Mandalay Bay and Russell Road.\n\nBecause of the number and size of the resorts, the resort corridor can be quite wide. [[Interstate 15 (Nevada)|Interstate 15]] runs roughly parallel and {{convert|0.5|to|0.8|mi|km}} to the west of Las Vegas Boulevard for the entire length of the Strip. Paradise Road runs to the east in a similar fashion, and ends at St. Louis Avenue. The eastern side of the Strip is bounded by [[McCarran International Airport]] south of Tropicana Avenue.\n\nNorth of this point, the resort corridor can be considered to extend as far east as Paradise Road, although some consider Koval Lane as a less inclusive boundary. Interstate 15 is sometimes considered the western edge of the resort corridor from Interstate 215 to Spring Mountain Road. North of this point, Industrial Road serves as the western edge.\n\nNewer [[hotel]]s and [[resort]]s such as [[South Point Hotel, Casino & Spa|South Point]], [[The Grandview at Las Vegas|Grandview Resort]], and [[M Resort]] are on Las Vegas Boulevard South as distant as 8 miles south of the \"Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas\" sign.

Its success spawned a second hotel on what would become the Strip, the [[Hotel Last Frontier]] in 1942. [[Organized crime]] figures such as New York's [[Bugsy Siegel]] took interest in the growing gaming center, and funded other resorts such as the [[Flamingo Las Vegas|Flamingo]], which opened in 1946, and the [[Desert Inn]], which opened in 1950.

In 1968, [[Kirk Kerkorian]] purchased the [[Flamingo Las Vegas|Flamingo]] and hired Sahara Hotels Vice President Alex Shoofey as President. Alex Shoofey brought along 33 of Sahara's top executives. The Flamingo was used to train future employees of the International Hotel, which was under construction. Opening in 1969, the [[Las Vegas Hilton|International Hotel]], with 1,512 rooms, began the era of mega-resorts. The International is known as Westgate Las Vegas today.<!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:The Desert Inn.jpg|thumb|right|[[The Desert Inn]] on the Strip in the 1960s]] --> The first [[Bally's Las Vegas|MGM Grand Hotel and Casino]], also a Kerkorian property, opened in 1973 with 2,084 rooms. At the time, this was one of the largest hotels in the world by number of rooms. The [[Rossiya Hotel]] built in 1967 in Moscow, for instance, had 3,200 rooms; however, most of the rooms in the Rossiya Hotel were single rooms of 118 sq. ft (roughly 1/4 size of a standard room at the MGM Grand Resort). On November 21, 1980, the MGM Grand suffered the worst [[MGM Grand Fire|resort fire]] in the history of Las Vegas as a result of electrical problems, killing 87 people. It reopened eight months later. In 1986, Kerkorian sold the MGM Grand to [[Bally Manufacturing]], and it was renamed [[Bally's Las Vegas|Bally's]].\n\nThe [[Wet 'n Wild (Las Vegas)|Wet 'n Wild water park]] opened in 1985 and was located on the south side of the Sahara hotel. It closed at the end of the 2004 season and was later demolished. The opening of [[The Mirage]] in 1989 set a new level to the Las Vegas experience, as smaller hotels and casinos made way for the larger mega-resorts. The [[Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino|Rio]] and the [[Excalibur Hotel and Casino|Excalibur]] opened in 1990. These huge facilities offer entertainment and [[restaurant|dining]] options, as well as gambling and lodging. This change affected the smaller, well-known and now historic hotels and casinos, like the [[Dunes (hotel and casino)|Dunes]], the [[Sands Hotel|Sands]], and the [[Stardust Hotel|Stardust]].\n\nThe lights along the Strip have been dimmed in a sign of respect to six performers and one other major Las Vegas figure upon their deaths.

High end dining, specialty retail, spas and nightclubs increasingly became options for visitors in addition to gambling at most Strip resorts. There was also a trend towards expensive residential condo units on the strip.\n\nIn 2004, [[MGM Mirage]] announced plans for [[CityCenter]], a {{convert|66|acre|adj=on}}, $7&nbsp;billion multi-use project on the site of the [[Boardwalk Hotel and Casino|Boardwalk]] hotel and adjoining land.

Phrases such as ''Strip Area'', ''Resort Corridor'' or ''Resort District'' are sometimes used to indicate a larger geographical area, including properties {{convert|1|mi|km}} or more away from Las Vegas Boulevard, such as the [[Westgate Las Vegas]], [[Hard Rock Hotel and Casino (Las Vegas)|Hard Rock]], [[Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino|Rio]], [[Palms Casino Resort|Palms]], and [[Oyo Hotel & Casino|Oyo]] resorts.\n\nThe [[Sahara Las Vegas|Sahara]] is widely considered the Strip's northern terminus, though travel guides typically extend it to the [[Stratosphere Las Vegas|Stratosphere]] {{convert|0.4|mi|km}} to the north. [[Mandalay Bay]], just north of Russell Road, is the southernmost resort considered to be on the Strip (the [[Klondike Hotel and Casino|Klondike]] was the southernmost until 2006, when it was closed, although it was not included in the Strip on some definitions and travel guides). The \"Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas\" sign is often considered part of the Strip, although it sits 0.4 miles south of the Mandalay Bay and Russell Road.\n\nBecause of the number and size of the resorts, the resort corridor can be quite wide. [[Interstate 15 (Nevada)|Interstate 15]] runs roughly parallel and {{convert|0.5|to|0.8|mi|km}} to the west of Las Vegas Boulevard for the entire length of the Strip. Paradise Road runs to the east in a similar fashion, and ends at St. Louis Avenue. The eastern side of the Strip is bounded by [[McCarran International Airport]] south of Tropicana Avenue.\n\nNorth of this point, the resort corridor can be considered to extend as far east as Paradise Road, although some consider Koval Lane as a less inclusive boundary. Interstate 15 is sometimes considered the western edge of the resort corridor from Interstate 215 to Spring Mountain Road. North of this point, Industrial Road serves as the western edge.\n\nNewer [[hotel]]s and [[resort]]s such as [[South Point Hotel, Casino & Spa|South Point]], [[The Grandview at Las Vegas|Grandview Resort]], and [[M Resort]] are on Las Vegas Boulevard South as distant as 8 miles south of the \"Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas\" sign.

Its success spawned a second hotel on what would become the Strip, the [[Hotel Last Frontier]] in 1942. [[Organized crime]] figures such as New York's [[Bugsy Siegel]] took interest in the growing gaming center, and funded other resorts such as the [[Flamingo Las Vegas|Flamingo]], which opened in 1946, and the [[Desert Inn]], which opened in 1950.

In 1968, [[Kirk Kerkorian]] purchased the [[Flamingo Las Vegas|Flamingo]] and hired Sahara Hotels Vice President Alex Shoofey as President. Alex Shoofey brought along 33 of Sahara's top executives. The Flamingo was used to train future employees of the International Hotel, which was under construction. Opening in 1969, the [[Las Vegas Hilton|International Hotel]], with 1,512 rooms, began the era of mega-resorts. The International is known as Westgate Las Vegas today.<!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:The Desert Inn.jpg|thumb|right|[[The Desert Inn]] on the Strip in the 1960s]] --> The first [[Bally's Las Vegas|MGM Grand Hotel and Casino]], also a Kerkorian property, opened in 1973 with 2,084 rooms. At the time, this was one of the largest hotels in the world by number of rooms. The [[Rossiya Hotel]] built in 1967 in Moscow, for instance, had 3,200 rooms; however, most of the rooms in the Rossiya Hotel were single rooms of 118 sq. ft (roughly 1/4 size of a standard room at the MGM Grand Resort). On November 21, 1980, the MGM Grand suffered the worst [[MGM Grand Fire|resort fire]] in the history of Las Vegas as a result of electrical problems, killing 87 people. It reopened eight months later. In 1986, Kerkorian sold the MGM Grand to [[Bally Manufacturing]], and it was renamed [[Bally's Las Vegas|Bally's]].\n\nThe [[Wet 'n Wild (Las Vegas)|Wet 'n Wild water park]] opened in 1985 and was located on the south side of the Sahara hotel. It closed at the end of the 2004 season and was later demolished. The opening of [[The Mirage]] in 1989 set a new level to the Las Vegas experience, as smaller hotels and casinos made way for the larger mega-resorts. The [[Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino|Rio]] and the [[Excalibur Hotel and Casino|Excalibur]] opened in 1990. These huge facilities offer entertainment and [[restaurant|dining]] options, as well as gambling and lodging. This change affected the smaller, well-known and now historic hotels and casinos, like the [[Dunes (hotel and casino)|Dunes]], the [[Sands Hotel|Sands]], and the [[Stardust Hotel|Stardust]].\n\nThe lights along the Strip have been dimmed in a sign of respect to six performers and one other major Las Vegas figure upon their deaths.

High end dining, specialty retail, spas and nightclubs increasingly became options for visitors in addition to gambling at most Strip resorts. There was also a trend towards expensive residential condo units on the strip.\n\nIn 2004, [[MGM Mirage]] announced plans for [[CityCenter]], a {{convert|66|acre|adj=on}}, $7&nbsp;billion multi-use project on the site of the [[Boardwalk Hotel and Casino|Boardwalk]] hotel and adjoining land.
