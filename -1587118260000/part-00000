The game, with its [[dark fantasy]] and [[horror fiction|horror]] themes, was conceptualized and designed by [[David Brevik]] and Erich Schaefer, who, with Max Schaefer, acted as project leads on the game. The producers were Matthew Householder and [[Bill Roper (video game producer)|Bill Roper]].\n\nBuilding on the success of its predecessor, ''[[Diablo (video game)|Diablo]]'' (1997), ''Diablo II'' was one of the most popular games of 2000<ref name=\"gamespy_review\">Madigan, Jamie.

Act V will only be briefly mentioned here, full details will be found on the LOD expansion page. -->\n\n''Diablo II''{{'}}s storyline progresses through four chapters or \"Acts\". Each act follows a predetermined path, but the wilderness areas and dungeons between key cities are randomly generated. The player progresses through the story by completing a series of quests within each act, while there are also optional side dungeons for extra monsters and experience. In contrast to the first ''Diablo'', whose levels consisted of descending deeper and deeper into a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic-themed]] dungeon and Hell, ''Diablo II''{{'}}s environments are much more varied. Act I is similar to the original ''Diablo''; the Rogue Encampment is a simple palisade fort, while plains and forests making up the wilderness area, and the Monastery resembles the typical Middle Ages fortress. Act II mimics Ancient [[Egypt]]'s desert and tombs; Lut Gholein resembles a Middle Eastern city and palace during the Crusades. Act III is supposedly based on the [[Central America]]n jungles; Kurast is inspired by the lost [[Mayan civilization]]. Act IV takes place in Hell and is the shortest, with just three quests compared to the other Acts that have six.\n\nThe ''Lord of Destruction'' expansion adds the fifth chapter Act V which continues the story where Act IV left off. Act V's style is mainly mountainous as the player ascends Mount Arreat, with [[Alpine climate|alpine plateaus]] and icy tunnels and caverns. Occasional portals can take the player to dungeons in Hell (seen in Act IV) for extra monsters and experience. After reaching the summit of Arreat, the player gains access to the Worldstone Keep (whose architecture may be reminiscent of [[Angkor Wat]] and other [[Hindu]] temples).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/quests/ |title=The Arreat Summit - Quests |website=Classic.battle.net |accessdate=September 15, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927031511/http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/quests/ |archivedate=September 27, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the acts, there are three sequential difficulty levels: Normal, Nightmare, and Hell; completing the game (four Acts in the original or five Acts in the expansion) on a difficulty setting will open up the next level. On higher difficulties, monsters are more varied, stronger and may be resistant or immune to an element or physical damage; experience is penalized on dying, and the player's resistances are handicapped. However, better items are rewarded to players as they go through higher difficulties. A character retains all abilities and items between difficulties, and may return to a lower difficulty at any time, albeit it is not possible to re-play the quests that are already completed.\n\nPlayers can create a hardcore character. In normal mode, the player can resurrect their character if killed and resume playing, while a hardcore character has only one life. If killed, the character is [[permadeath|permanently dead]] and unplayable. In addition, all items and equipment on that character will be lost unless another friendly character has the \"loot\" icon checked. Standard and hardcore characters play on separate online channels; as such a hardcore player can never appear in the same game session as a standard player.\n\n===Item system===\n''Diablo II'' uses a system of randomly generated equipment similar to the [[Diablo (video game)#Items|original ''Diablo'']], but more complicated. Weapons and armor are divided into several quality levels: normal, magical, set, rare and unique. Normal quality items are base items with a fixed set of basic properties, such as attribute requirements, maximum durability, armor rating (on armor), block chance (on shields), damage and attack speed (on weapons). Magical quality items have blue names and one or two randomly selected bonuses, such as bonuses attributes, skills or damage, indicated by a prefix or suffix. Rare quality items have randomly generated yellow names and 2 to 6 random properties. Unique items have fixed names in gold text, and instead of randomized properties, they have a set of 3 to 8 preselected properties. Green-named set items have fixed names and preselected properties like unique items, and belong to specific named sets of 2 to 6 items. Additional properties known as set bonuses are activated by equipping multiple or all items from the same set. These are themed on individuals, like Civerb's cudgel, shield and amulet each provide individual bonuses which are enhanced if two or more of the items are used to equip a character. It is unusual to encounter more than one item from a set in a single playthrough of the game, so collectors need to play the game many times to accumulate all items from a set, or purchase them online from other players who possess them but do not need them. Additionally, items can possess sockets, which can be used to upgrade items by adding gems for various bonuses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/items/|title=The Arreat Summit - Items|author=|date=|website=classic.battle.net|accessdate=March 27, 2018}}</ref>\n\n''Diablo II'' includes an item crafting system. An item known as the Horadric Cube is used to combine two or more items to create a new item. For example, 3 identical lower quality gems can be combined to create a single higher quality gem, and 3 small rejuvenation potions can be combined to create a single, more powerful rejuvenation potion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/items/cube.shtml|title=The Arreat Summit - Items: The Horadric Cube|author=|date=|website=classic.battle.net|accessdate=March 27, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Character classes===\n[[File:Diablo II characters.jpg|thumb|300px|The five character classes in ''Diablo II'' as seen during the opening selection animation. From left to right: the Amazon, Necromancer, Barbarian, Sorceress, and Paladin.]]\n\n''Diablo II'' allows the player to choose between five different character classes: Amazon, Necromancer, Barbarian, Sorceress, and Paladin. Each character has different strengths, weaknesses and sets of skills to choose from, as well as varying beginning attributes. The maximum level that any character can obtain is level 99.\n\n* '''The Amazon''' hails from the islands of the Twin Seas, near the border of the Great Ocean, and her clan is a rival to the Sisters of the Sightless Eye (known as Rogues). The Amazon is akin to the Rogue of ''Diablo'': both primarily use bows, and both make equal use of strength and magic, however the Amazon can also use javelins and spears. Many of her defensive skills are passive in nature, especially Dodge, Avoid, and Evade.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/classes/amazonhistory.shtml |title=Amazon History |website=Arreat Summit |accessdate=November 24, 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317140252/http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/classes/amazonhistory.shtml |archivedate=March 17, 2010 }}</ref> The Amazon is voiced by [[Jessica Straus (voice actress)|Jessica Straus]].<ref name=\"credits\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/computer/doswin/data/197113.html |title=Diablo II: Credits |website=[[GameFAQs]] |accessdate=November 24, 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091125104612/http://www.gamefaqs.com/computer/doswin/data/197113.html |archivedate=November 25, 2009 }}</ref>\n* '''The Necromancer''' is a versatile death-themed spell caster. Necromancers are the priests of the Cult of Rathma from the Eastern jungles. His Summoning skills allow him to raise skeletons, create golems, and resurrect dead monsters to fight alongside him. The Necromancer possesses powerful poison spells, which rapidly drain life from afflicted monsters. He also has \"Bone\" skills, which directly damage enemies, while bypassing most resistances. His Curses also afflict the enemy with debilitating status ailments, sowing confusion and chaos in their ranks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/classes/necromancerhistory.shtml |title=Necromancer History |website=Arreat Summit |accessdate=November 24, 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310164348/http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/classes/necromancerhistory.shtml |archivedate=March 10, 2010 }}</ref> The Necromancer is voiced by [[Michael McConnohie]].<ref name=\"credits\" />\n* '''The Barbarian''' is a powerful melee fighter from the steppes of Mount Arreat. He is an expert at frontline combat, able to absorb great punishment, and is the only class capable of [[dual wield]]ing weapons. His Combat Masteries allow him to specialize in different types of weapons, and also passively increase his resistance, speed, and defense. His Warcries dramatically increase the combat effectiveness of him and his party, as well as afflicting status ailments on enemies. He has a variety of Combat Skills at his command, most of which focus on delivering great force upon a single foe, while some also give him considerable athleticism allowing him to leap over chasms and rivers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/classes/barbarianhistory.shtml |title=Barbarian History |website=Arreat Summit |accessdate=November 24, 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317140737/http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/classes/barbarianhistory.shtml |archivedate=March 17, 2010 }}</ref> The Barbarian is voiced by [[David A. Thomas (voice actor)|David Thomas]].<ref name=\"credits\" />\n* '''The Sorceress''' hails from a rebellious coven of female witches who have wrested the secrets of magic use from the male-dominated mage clans of the East. She can cast ice, lightning and fire spells. Nearly all of these skills are offensive in nature, besieging the enemy with elemental calamity. Her Cold Skills can freeze enemies solid and bypass resistances, but do less damage than lightning or fire. The Sorceress's ''Teleport'' spell allows her to instantly travel to a new destination, making her very difficult to hit. The strong point of the Sorceress is her damaging spells and casting speed; her weakness is her relatively low hit points and defense.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/classes/sorceresshistory.shtml |title=Sorceress History |website=Arreat Summit |accessdate=November 24, 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327090651/http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/classes/sorceresshistory.shtml |archivedate=March 27, 2010 }}</ref> The Sorceress is voiced by Liana Young.<ref name=\"credits\" />\n* '''The Paladin''' is a crusader from the Church of Zakarum, fighting for the glory of the Light. He is part of the forces that defeated King Leoric's army in the first ''Diablo'', although his Order is eventually corrupted by Mephisto, the Lord of Hatred. To reflect his holy nature, the zealous Paladin's combat skills range from fanatical attacks to heavenly thunderbolts. His skills are split into Combat Skills, Defensive Auras, and Offensive Auras. His auras have a range of abilities, such as increasing damage, resisting magic attacks, or boosting defense. Most auras either affect all party members and allies, or all enemies within the area of effect. The Paladin is highly proficient in the use of a shield, and is the only character that can use it as a weapon. The Paladin also has specialized skills for eliminating the undead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/classes/paladinhistory.shtml |title=Paladin History |website=Arreat Summit |accessdate=November 24, 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317141317/http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/classes/paladinhistory.shtml |archivedate=March 17, 2010 }}</ref> The Paladin is voiced by [[Larry B. Scott]].<ref name=\"credits\" />\n\nTwo additional character classes, the Druid and Assassin, were added in the expansion ''[[Diablo II: Lord of Destruction]]''.\n\n*'''The Druid''' is a shapeshifter with the ability to transform into a bear or werewolf form, summon various creatures such as ravens and wolves, and attack with nature-based elemental magic like lightning or poisonous vines. The Druid offers a wide versatility of skills and  can be built in several different playstyles. The Druid is voiced by Michael Bell.\n\n*'''The Assassin''' is a [[martial arts]] based class from the Viz-Jaq'taar clan who fights with claw blades and supplements her attacks with the use of shadow magic skills and fire or lightning elemental traps, which remain stationary and affect groups of enemies. The Assassin is voiced by Carrie Gordon.\n\nThe player can enlist the help of one hireling (computer-controlled [[mercenary|mercenaries]]) from a mercenary captain in the town; Rogue Scouts (archers with Amazon abilities), Desert Mercenaries or Town Guards (melee fighters with Paladin auras), Iron Wolves (elemental spellcasters with occasional melee capability), and Barbarians (melee fighters with [[Tank (video games)|lots of hitpoints]]), from Acts I, II, III, IV and V ([[Diablo II: Lord of Destruction|expansion]] only). In the original release of the game, hirelings would not follow the player through different Acts, nor be revived if killed. The expansion allows players to retain their mercenary throughout the entire game as well as equipping them with armor and weapons, plus hirelings gain experience and attributes like the player although their level cannot surpass that of their master character.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/basics/hirelings.shtml |title=The Arreat Summit - Basics: Hirelings |website=Classic.battle.net |accessdate=September 15, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130715021422/http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/basics/hirelings.shtml |archivedate=July 15, 2013 }}</ref> Typically players choose a hireling that provides something missing from their character class; for instance the melee-focused Paladin may choose an Iron Wolf for ranged magical support.\n\nIn ''[[Heroes of the Storm]]'' (2015), Blizzard's crossover [[multiplayer online battle arena]], playable heroes Cassia and Xul represent the Amazon and the Necromancer character classes, respectively.\n\n===Multiplayer===\n''Diablo II'' can be played multiplayer on a [[local area network]] (LAN) or the Blizzard's [[Battle.net]] online service.

Up to eight players can be in one game; they can either unite as a single party, play as individuals, or form multiple opposing parties. Experience gained, monsters' hit points and damage, and the number of items dropped are all increased as more players join a game, though not in a strictly proportional manner. Players are allowed to duel each other with all damage being reduced in player vs player (PvP). The bounty for a successful kill in PvP is a portion of the gold and the \"ear\" of the defeated player (with the previous owner's name and level at the time of the kill).\n\nThe Ladder System is reset at various intervals by Blizzard to allow for all players to start fresh with new characters on an equal footing. Ladder seasons have lasted from as short as six months to over a year. When a ladder season ends, all ladder characters are transferred to the non-ladder population.

In ''Diablo'', an unnamed warrior defeated Diablo and attempted to contain the Lord of Terror's essence within his own body. Since then, the hero has become corrupted by the demon's spirit, causing demons to enter the world around him and wreak havoc.\n\nA band of adventurers who pass through the Rogue Encampment hear these stories of destruction and attempt to find out the cause of the evil, starting with this corrupted \"Dark Wanderer.\" As the story develops, the truth behind this corruption is revealed: the soulstones were originally intended to imprison the Prime Evils after they were banished to the mortal realm by the Lesser Evils. With the corruption of Diablo's soulstone, the demon is able to control the Dark Wanderer and is attempting to free his two brothers Mephisto, and Baal. Baal, united with the mage Tal-Rasha, is imprisoned in a tomb near Lut Gholein. Mephisto is imprisoned in the eastern temple city of Kurast.\n\nAs the story progresses, cut scenes show the Dark Wanderer's journey as a drifter named Marius follows him. The player realizes that the Dark Wanderer's mission is to reunite with the other prime evils, Baal and Mephisto. The story is divided up into four acts:\n\n:'''Act I''' \u2013 The adventurers rescue Cain, who is imprisoned in Tristram, and then begin following the Dark Wanderer. The Dark Wanderer has one of the lesser evils, Andariel, corrupt the Sisters of the Sightless Eye (Rogues) and take over their Monastery. The adventurers overcome Andariel and then follow the Wanderer east.\n:'''Act II''' \u2013 While the adventurers search the eastern desert for Tal-Rasha's tomb, the Dark Wanderer gets there first. Marius is tricked into removing Baal's soulstone from Tal-Rasha and the Archangel Tyrael charges Marius with taking the soulstone to Hell to destroy it.\n:'''Act III''' \u2013 The Dark Wanderer and Baal look for Mephisto in the Temple of Kurast. Still imprisoned in the dungeon below the temple, Mephisto was able to corrupt the High Council of Zakarum and take over the region. While the adventurers fight their way to the temple, Mephisto is rejoined by his brothers; the three open a portal to Hell, the Dark Wanderer sheds his human form, becomes the demon Diablo, and go through the portal. The adventurers arrive later, defeat Mephisto, who was left guarding the entrance, and take his soulstone.\n:'''Act IV''' \u2013 The adventurers slay Diablo in Hell and destroy the soulstones of Mephisto and Diablo on the Hellforge, preventing their return.\n\nIn the epilogue, Marius, speaking in a prison cell, indicates he was too weak to enter Hell, and that he fears the stone's effects on him. He gives the soulstone to his visitor. The visitor reveals himself to be Baal, the last surviving Prime Evil now in possession of his own soulstone. He then kills Marius and sets the prison cell on fire.\n\nThe story continues in the expansion ''[[Diablo II: Lord of Destruction]]'' where Baal attempts to corrupt the mythical Worldstone on Mount Arreat. Upon returning to the Pandemonium Fortress after defeating Diablo, Tyrael opens a portal to send the adventurers to Arreat.\n\n==Development==\n{{expand section|date=November 2019}}\n''Diablo II'' was announced by Blizzard in 1997, with a planned launch in the first quarter of 1998.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=In the Studio|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=35|publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=November 1997|page=22}}</ref> According to designer and project lead Erich Schaefer, \"Diablo II never had an official, complete design document... for the most part we just started making up new stuff.\"<ref name=\"Schaefer, Erich\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3124/postmortem_blizzards_diablo_ii.php |title=Postmortem: Blizzard's Diablo II |website=Gamasutra |date=October 25, 2000 |accessdate=February 28, 2014 |author=Schaefer, Erich |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514015319/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3124/postmortem_blizzards_diablo_ii.php |archivedate=May 14, 2014 }}</ref> The game was slated to have two years of development work, but it took Blizzard North over three years to finish. ''Diablo II'', despite having less than one percent of the original code from ''Diablo'' and having much of its content and internal coding done from scratch, was seen by the testers as \"more of the same.\" The game was meant to be released simultaneously both in North America and internationally. This allowed the marketing and PR department for Blizzard North to focus their efforts in building up excitement in players worldwide for the first week of sales, contributing to the game's success.<ref name=\"Schaefer, Erich\"/>\n\n===Music===\n{{main|Diablo II Soundtrack}}\n\nThe score was composed by [[Matt Uelmen]] and integrates creepy ambience with melodic pieces. The style of the score is [[ambient industrial]] and [[Experimental music|experimental]].<ref name=\"mp3oftheweek\">{{cite web|url=http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/mp3/ |title=Battle.net Matt Uelmen Liner Notes |last=Uelmen |first=Matt |website=Gamasutra |accessdate=January 20, 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324043641/http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/mp3/ |archivedate=March 24, 2009 }}</ref> It was recorded in Redwood City, Oakland, and San Mateo, California, from April 1997 to March 2000.\n\nSome tracks were created by reusing the tracks from the original game, while others by rearranging tracks that were out-takes. Other scores are combinations of parts that were created more than a year after the first game's release. A single track usually integrates recorded samples from sound libraries, live recorded instrument interpretation samples specially meant for the game (guitar, flute, oriental percussion), and electronic instruments also, making the tracks difficult for later live interpretations.\n\nWhile the player visits the town, the game recreates the peaceful atmosphere from the first ''Diablo'' game, so for that the theme from Act I called \"Rogue\" comes back with the same chords of the original piece, reproducing only a part of the original ''Diablo'' town theme. For Act II Mustafa Waiz, a percussionist, and Scott Petersen, the game's sound designer, worked on the drum samples. Waiz played on the dumbek, djembe, and finger cymbals which gave Matt Uelmen a base upon which to build tracks around.\n\nThe town theme from Act II, \"Toru\", makes strong statement of departure from the world of Act I while also maintaining a thematic connection to what had come before. It is the first time in the series to be used some radically different elements than the guitars and choral sounds that dominate both the original Diablo and the opening quarter of ''Diablo II''. The foundation of the \"Toru\" piece is found in exciting dynamics of a Chinese wind gong. The instrument radically changes color from a steady mysterious drone to a harsh, fearsome noise, that gives exotic feeling and at the same time the pacing of the second town. In all sequences of Act II with deserts and valleys, Arabic percussion sounds dominate.\n\nThe composer was impressed by two of the Spectrasonics music libraries, ''Symphony of Voices'' and ''Heart of Asia.'' He used samples from ''Heart of Asia'' in the ''Harem'' piece from Act II. The \"Crypt\" track uses a sample from ''Symphony of Voices''; the choral phrase ''Miserere''. Voice samples from ''Heart of Asia'', ''Heart of Africa'', and ''Symphony of Voices'' by [[Spectrasonics]].\nThe \"Harem\" track samples from ''Heart of Asia'' the Sanskrit Female 1 samples.<ref name=\"Heart of Asia Akai CD-ROM Directory\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ilio.com/spectrasonics/heartofasia/cdrom.html |title=Akai CD-ROM Directory |publisher=ilio |accessdate=January 4, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205044629/http://www.ilio.com/spectrasonics/heartofasia/cdrom.html |archivedate=December 5, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nThe game was released in ''Collector's Edition'' format, containing bonus [[Collector's edition|collector's material]], a copy of the ''Diablo'' ''Dungeons & Dragons'' pen-and-paper campaign setting, and promotional movies for other Blizzard games.

Each act follows a predetermined path, but the wilderness areas and dungeons between key cities are randomly generated. The player progresses through the story by completing a series of quests within each act, while there are also optional side dungeons for extra monsters and experience. In contrast to the first ''Diablo'', whose levels consisted of descending deeper and deeper into a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic-themed]] dungeon and Hell, ''Diablo II''{{'}}s environments are much more varied. Act I is similar to the original ''Diablo''; the Rogue Encampment is a simple palisade fort, while plains and forests making up the wilderness area, and the Monastery resembles the typical Middle Ages fortress. Act II mimics Ancient [[Egypt]]'s desert and tombs; Lut Gholein resembles a Middle Eastern city and palace during the Crusades. Act III is supposedly based on the [[Central America]]n jungles; Kurast is inspired by the lost [[Mayan civilization]]. Act IV takes place in Hell and is the shortest, with just three quests compared to the other Acts that have six.\n\nThe ''Lord of Destruction'' expansion adds the fifth chapter Act V which continues the story where Act IV left off. Act V's style is mainly mountainous as the player ascends Mount Arreat, with [[Alpine climate|alpine plateaus]] and icy tunnels and caverns. Occasional portals can take the player to dungeons in Hell (seen in Act IV) for extra monsters and experience. After reaching the summit of Arreat, the player gains access to the Worldstone Keep (whose architecture may be reminiscent of [[Angkor Wat]] and other [[Hindu]] temples).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/quests/ |title=The Arreat Summit - Quests |website=Classic.battle.net |accessdate=September 15, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927031511/http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/quests/ |archivedate=September 27, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the acts, there are three sequential difficulty levels: Normal, Nightmare, and Hell; completing the game (four Acts in the original or five Acts in the expansion) on a difficulty setting will open up the next level. On higher difficulties, monsters are more varied, stronger and may be resistant or immune to an element or physical damage; experience is penalized on dying, and the player's resistances are handicapped. However, better items are rewarded to players as they go through higher difficulties. A character retains all abilities and items between difficulties, and may return to a lower difficulty at any time, albeit it is not possible to re-play the quests that are already completed.\n\nPlayers can create a hardcore character. In normal mode, the player can resurrect their character if killed and resume playing, while a hardcore character has only one life. If killed, the character is [[permadeath|permanently dead]] and unplayable. In addition, all items and equipment on that character will be lost unless another friendly character has the \"loot\" icon checked. Standard and hardcore characters play on separate online channels; as such a hardcore player can never appear in the same game session as a standard player.\n\n===Item system===\n''Diablo II'' uses a system of randomly generated equipment similar to the [[Diablo (video game)#Items|original ''Diablo'']], but more complicated. Weapons and armor are divided into several quality levels: normal, magical, set, rare and unique. Normal quality items are base items with a fixed set of basic properties, such as attribute requirements, maximum durability, armor rating (on armor), block chance (on shields), damage and attack speed (on weapons). Magical quality items have blue names and one or two randomly selected bonuses, such as bonuses attributes, skills or damage, indicated by a prefix or suffix. Rare quality items have randomly generated yellow names and 2 to 6 random properties. Unique items have fixed names in gold text, and instead of randomized properties, they have a set of 3 to 8 preselected properties. Green-named set items have fixed names and preselected properties like unique items, and belong to specific named sets of 2 to 6 items. Additional properties known as set bonuses are activated by equipping multiple or all items from the same set. These are themed on individuals, like Civerb's cudgel, shield and amulet each provide individual bonuses which are enhanced if two or more of the items are used to equip a character. It is unusual to encounter more than one item from a set in a single playthrough of the game, so collectors need to play the game many times to accumulate all items from a set, or purchase them online from other players who possess them but do not need them. Additionally, items can possess sockets, which can be used to upgrade items by adding gems for various bonuses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/items/|title=The Arreat Summit - Items|author=|date=|website=classic.battle.net|accessdate=March 27, 2018}}</ref>\n\n''Diablo II'' includes an item crafting system. An item known as the Horadric Cube is used to combine two or more items to create a new item. For example, 3 identical lower quality gems can be combined to create a single higher quality gem, and 3 small rejuvenation potions can be combined to create a single, more powerful rejuvenation potion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/items/cube.shtml|title=The Arreat Summit - Items: The Horadric Cube|author=|date=|website=classic.battle.net|accessdate=March 27, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Character classes===\n[[File:Diablo II characters.jpg|thumb|300px|The five character classes in ''Diablo II'' as seen during the opening selection animation. From left to right: the Amazon, Necromancer, Barbarian, Sorceress, and Paladin.]]\n\n''Diablo II'' allows the player to choose between five different character classes: Amazon, Necromancer, Barbarian, Sorceress, and Paladin. Each character has different strengths, weaknesses and sets of skills to choose from, as well as varying beginning attributes. The maximum level that any character can obtain is level 99.\n\n* '''The Amazon''' hails from the islands of the Twin Seas, near the border of the Great Ocean, and her clan is a rival to the Sisters of the Sightless Eye (known as Rogues). The Amazon is akin to the Rogue of ''Diablo'': both primarily use bows, and both make equal use of strength and magic, however the Amazon can also use javelins and spears. Many of her defensive skills are passive in nature, especially Dodge, Avoid, and Evade.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/classes/amazonhistory.shtml |title=Amazon History |website=Arreat Summit |accessdate=November 24, 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317140252/http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/classes/amazonhistory.shtml |archivedate=March 17, 2010 }}</ref> The Amazon is voiced by [[Jessica Straus (voice actress)|Jessica Straus]].<ref name=\"credits\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/computer/doswin/data/197113.html |title=Diablo II: Credits |website=[[GameFAQs]] |accessdate=November 24, 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091125104612/http://www.gamefaqs.com/computer/doswin/data/197113.html |archivedate=November 25, 2009 }}</ref>\n* '''The Necromancer''' is a versatile death-themed spell caster. Necromancers are the priests of the Cult of Rathma from the Eastern jungles. His Summoning skills allow him to raise skeletons, create golems, and resurrect dead monsters to fight alongside him. The Necromancer possesses powerful poison spells, which rapidly drain life from afflicted monsters. He also has \"Bone\" skills, which directly damage enemies, while bypassing most resistances. His Curses also afflict the enemy with debilitating status ailments, sowing confusion and chaos in their ranks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/classes/necromancerhistory.shtml |title=Necromancer History |website=Arreat Summit |accessdate=November 24, 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310164348/http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/classes/necromancerhistory.shtml |archivedate=March 10, 2010 }}</ref> The Necromancer is voiced by [[Michael McConnohie]].<ref name=\"credits\" />\n* '''The Barbarian''' is a powerful melee fighter from the steppes of Mount Arreat. He is an expert at frontline combat, able to absorb great punishment, and is the only class capable of [[dual wield]]ing weapons. His Combat Masteries allow him to specialize in different types of weapons, and also passively increase his resistance, speed, and defense. His Warcries dramatically increase the combat effectiveness of him and his party, as well as afflicting status ailments on enemies. He has a variety of Combat Skills at his command, most of which focus on delivering great force upon a single foe, while some also give him considerable athleticism allowing him to leap over chasms and rivers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/classes/barbarianhistory.shtml |title=Barbarian History |website=Arreat Summit |accessdate=November 24, 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317140737/http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/classes/barbarianhistory.shtml |archivedate=March 17, 2010 }}</ref> The Barbarian is voiced by [[David A. Thomas (voice actor)|David Thomas]].<ref name=\"credits\" />\n* '''The Sorceress''' hails from a rebellious coven of female witches who have wrested the secrets of magic use from the male-dominated mage clans of the East. She can cast ice, lightning and fire spells. Nearly all of these skills are offensive in nature, besieging the enemy with elemental calamity. Her Cold Skills can freeze enemies solid and bypass resistances, but do less damage than lightning or fire. The Sorceress's ''Teleport'' spell allows her to instantly travel to a new destination, making her very difficult to hit. The strong point of the Sorceress is her damaging spells and casting speed; her weakness is her relatively low hit points and defense.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/classes/sorceresshistory.shtml |title=Sorceress History |website=Arreat Summit |accessdate=November 24, 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327090651/http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/classes/sorceresshistory.shtml |archivedate=March 27, 2010 }}</ref> The Sorceress is voiced by Liana Young.<ref name=\"credits\" />\n* '''The Paladin''' is a crusader from the Church of Zakarum, fighting for the glory of the Light. He is part of the forces that defeated King Leoric's army in the first ''Diablo'', although his Order is eventually corrupted by Mephisto, the Lord of Hatred. To reflect his holy nature, the zealous Paladin's combat skills range from fanatical attacks to heavenly thunderbolts. His skills are split into Combat Skills, Defensive Auras, and Offensive Auras. His auras have a range of abilities, such as increasing damage, resisting magic attacks, or boosting defense. Most auras either affect all party members and allies, or all enemies within the area of effect. The Paladin is highly proficient in the use of a shield, and is the only character that can use it as a weapon. The Paladin also has specialized skills for eliminating the undead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/classes/paladinhistory.shtml |title=Paladin History |website=Arreat Summit |accessdate=November 24, 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317141317/http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/classes/paladinhistory.shtml |archivedate=March 17, 2010 }}</ref> The Paladin is voiced by [[Larry B. Scott]].<ref name=\"credits\" />\n\nTwo additional character classes, the Druid and Assassin, were added in the expansion ''[[Diablo II: Lord of Destruction]]''.\n\n*'''The Druid''' is a shapeshifter with the ability to transform into a bear or werewolf form, summon various creatures such as ravens and wolves, and attack with nature-based elemental magic like lightning or poisonous vines. The Druid offers a wide versatility of skills and  can be built in several different playstyles. The Druid is voiced by Michael Bell.\n\n*'''The Assassin''' is a [[martial arts]] based class from the Viz-Jaq'taar clan who fights with claw blades and supplements her attacks with the use of shadow magic skills and fire or lightning elemental traps, which remain stationary and affect groups of enemies. The Assassin is voiced by Carrie Gordon.\n\nThe player can enlist the help of one hireling (computer-controlled [[mercenary|mercenaries]]) from a mercenary captain in the town; Rogue Scouts (archers with Amazon abilities), Desert Mercenaries or Town Guards (melee fighters with Paladin auras), Iron Wolves (elemental spellcasters with occasional melee capability), and Barbarians (melee fighters with [[Tank (video games)|lots of hitpoints]]), from Acts I, II, III, and V ([[Diablo II: Lord of Destruction|expansion]] only). In the original release of the game, hirelings would not follow the player through different Acts, nor be revived if killed. The expansion allows players to retain their mercenary throughout the entire game as well as equipping them with armor and weapons, plus hirelings gain experience and attributes like the player although their level cannot surpass that of their master character.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/basics/hirelings.shtml |title=The Arreat Summit - Basics: Hirelings |website=Classic.battle.net |accessdate=September 15, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130715021422/http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/basics/hirelings.shtml |archivedate=July 15, 2013 }}</ref> Typically players choose a hireling that provides something missing from their character class; for instance the melee-focused Paladin may choose an Iron Wolf for ranged magical support.\n\nIn ''[[Heroes of the Storm]]'' (2015), Blizzard's crossover [[multiplayer online battle arena]], playable heroes Cassia and Xul represent the Amazon and the Necromancer character classes, respectively.\n\n===Multiplayer===\n''Diablo II'' can be played multiplayer on a [[local area network]] (LAN) or the Blizzard's [[Battle.net]] online service.

Up to eight players can be in one game; they can either unite as a single party, play as individuals, or form multiple opposing parties. Experience gained, monsters' hit points and damage, and the number of items dropped are all increased as more players join a game, though not in a strictly proportional manner. Players are allowed to duel each other with all damage being reduced in player vs player (PvP). The bounty for a successful kill in PvP is a portion of the gold and the \"ear\" of the defeated player (with the previous owner's name and level at the time of the kill).\n\nThe Ladder System is reset at various intervals by Blizzard to allow for all players to start fresh with new characters on an equal footing. Ladder seasons have lasted from as short as six months to over a year. When a ladder season ends, all ladder characters are transferred to the non-ladder population.

In ''Diablo'', an unnamed warrior defeated Diablo and attempted to contain the Lord of Terror's essence within his own body. Since then, the hero has become corrupted by the demon's spirit, causing demons to enter the world around him and wreak havoc.\n\nA band of adventurers who pass through the Rogue Encampment hear these stories of destruction and attempt to find out the cause of the evil, starting with this corrupted \"Dark Wanderer.\" As the story develops, the truth behind this corruption is revealed: the soulstones were originally intended to imprison the Prime Evils after they were banished to the mortal realm by the Lesser Evils. With the corruption of Diablo's soulstone, the demon is able to control the Dark Wanderer and is attempting to free his two brothers Mephisto, and Baal. Baal, united with the mage Tal-Rasha, is imprisoned in a tomb near Lut Gholein. Mephisto is imprisoned in the eastern temple city of Kurast.\n\nAs the story progresses, cut scenes show the Dark Wanderer's journey as a drifter named Marius follows him. The player realizes that the Dark Wanderer's mission is to reunite with the other prime evils, Baal and Mephisto. The story is divided up into four acts:\n\n:'''Act I''' \u2013 The adventurers rescue Cain, who is imprisoned in Tristram, and then begin following the Dark Wanderer. The Dark Wanderer has one of the lesser evils, Andariel, corrupt the Sisters of the Sightless Eye (Rogues) and take over their Monastery. The adventurers overcome Andariel and then follow the Wanderer east.\n:'''Act II''' \u2013 While the adventurers search the eastern desert for Tal-Rasha's tomb, the Dark Wanderer gets there first. Marius is tricked into removing Baal's soulstone from Tal-Rasha and the Archangel Tyrael charges Marius with taking the soulstone to Hell to destroy it.\n:'''Act III''' \u2013 The Dark Wanderer and Baal look for Mephisto in the Temple of Kurast. Still imprisoned in the dungeon below the temple, Mephisto was able to corrupt the High Council of Zakarum and take over the region. While the adventurers fight their way to the temple, Mephisto is rejoined by his brothers; the three open a portal to Hell, the Dark Wanderer sheds his human form, becomes the demon Diablo, and go through the portal. The adventurers arrive later, defeat Mephisto, who was left guarding the entrance, and take his soulstone.\n:'''Act IV''' \u2013 The adventurers slay Diablo in Hell and destroy the soulstones of Mephisto and Diablo on the Hellforge, preventing their return.\n\nIn the epilogue, Marius, speaking in a prison cell, indicates he was too weak to enter Hell, and that he fears the stone's effects on him. He gives the soulstone to his visitor. The visitor reveals himself to be Baal, the last surviving Prime Evil now in possession of his own soulstone. He then kills Marius and sets the prison cell on fire.\n\nThe story continues in the expansion ''[[Diablo II: Lord of Destruction]]'' where Baal attempts to corrupt the mythical Worldstone on Mount Arreat. Upon returning to the Pandemonium Fortress after defeating Diablo, Tyrael opens a portal to send the adventurers to Arreat.\n\n==Development==\n{{expand section|date=November 2019}}\n''Diablo II'' was announced by Blizzard in 1997, with a planned launch in the first quarter of 1998.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=In the Studio|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=35|publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=November 1997|page=22}}</ref> According to designer and project lead Erich Schaefer, \"Diablo II never had an official, complete design document... for the most part we just started making up new stuff.\"<ref name=\"Schaefer, Erich\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3124/postmortem_blizzards_diablo_ii.php |title=Postmortem: Blizzard's Diablo II |website=Gamasutra |date=October 25, 2000 |accessdate=February 28, 2014 |author=Schaefer, Erich |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514015319/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3124/postmortem_blizzards_diablo_ii.php |archivedate=May 14, 2014 }}</ref> The game was slated to have two years of development work, but it took Blizzard North over three years to finish. ''Diablo II'', despite having less than one percent of the original code from ''Diablo'' and having much of its content and internal coding done from scratch, was seen by the testers as \"more of the same.\" The game was meant to be released simultaneously both in North America and internationally. This allowed the marketing and PR department for Blizzard North to focus their efforts in building up excitement in players worldwide for the first week of sales, contributing to the game's success.<ref name=\"Schaefer, Erich\"/>\n\n===Music===\n{{main|Diablo II Soundtrack}}\n\nThe score was composed by [[Matt Uelmen]] and integrates creepy ambience with melodic pieces.

Other scores are combinations of parts that were created more than a year after the first game's release. A single track usually integrates recorded samples from sound libraries, live recorded instrument interpretation samples specially meant for the game (guitar, flute, oriental percussion), and electronic instruments also, making the tracks difficult for later live interpretations.\n\nWhile the player visits the town, the game recreates the peaceful atmosphere from the first ''Diablo'' game, so for that the theme from Act I called \"Rogue\" comes back with the same chords of the original piece, reproducing only a part of the original ''Diablo'' town theme. For Act II Mustafa Waiz, a percussionist, and Scott Petersen, the game's sound designer, worked on the drum samples. Waiz played on the dumbek, djembe, and finger cymbals which gave Matt Uelmen a base upon which to build tracks around.\n\nThe town theme from Act II, \"Toru\", makes strong statement of departure from the world of Act I while also maintaining a thematic connection to what had come before. It is the first time in the series to be used some radically different elements than the guitars and choral sounds that dominate both the original Diablo and the opening quarter of ''Diablo II''. The foundation of the \"Toru\" piece is found in exciting dynamics of a Chinese wind gong. The instrument radically changes color from a steady mysterious drone to a harsh, fearsome noise, that gives exotic feeling and at the same time the pacing of the second town. In all sequences of Act II with deserts and valleys, Arabic percussion sounds dominate.\n\nThe composer was impressed by two of the Spectrasonics music libraries, ''Symphony of Voices'' and ''Heart of Asia.'' He used samples from ''Heart of Asia'' in the ''Harem'' piece from Act II. The \"Crypt\" track uses a sample from ''Symphony of Voices''; the choral phrase ''Miserere''.

Texas Country is known for fusing [[Neotraditional country|neotraditional country]] with the outspoken, care-free views of [[outlaw country]]. Texas Country blends these sub-genres with a [[common people|\"common working man\"]] theme and witty undertones, these often combine with a stripped down music sound.\n\nNeither the location of birth nor the location of upbringing seems to calculate in the definition of a Texas Country artist, as long as the origin is not in the corporate Nashville scene as the genre tends to be anti-Nashville. The genre differentiates from Nashville country with its rejection of pop influences that is found in Nashville Country recently, but does not necessarily mean the artist/group is Texas based.  For example, [[Chris Knight (musician)|Chris Knight]] is considered by some to be a Texas Country musician, despite his [[Kentucky]] ties. [[Adam Hood]], an [[Alabama]] native, also has had success in the genre. Even international musicians, such as [[Alberta, Canada]] native [[Corb Lund]], have been successful in the Texas Country scene. This just shows how many musicians all over the world have adopted the Texas sound.\n\n==Instrumentation==\n{{unsourced section|date=July 2019}}\nThe [[Steel-string guitar|acoustic guitar]] is essential in Texas Country Music. However, the use of [[electric guitar]]s, [[steel guitar]]s or [[pedal steel guitar]]s in the genre is not uncommon. [[bass guitar|Bass]] and [[percussion]] are used in live performances. The sounds of [[piano]], [[baritone guitar]], [[banjo]], [[accordion]], [[fiddle]] or [[harmonica]] on studio recordings are the norm for the genre.\n\n==Vocals==\nThe line of delineation for vocals is unclear. Traditionally, the Texas Country scene has been a male dominated genre, however many women have had chart success in recent years. The Texas \"anthem\" is a common song type, referencing and sometimes embellishing on the different positive characteristics of the state. Many of these types of songs have been popular on the Texas Music Charts.<ref>[http://www.countryradioclassics.com/index.php/2007/09/21/texas-national-anthem-voting/ TX National Anthem voting ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703153140/http://www.countryradioclassics.com/index.php/2007/09/21/texas-national-anthem-voting |date=2008-07-03 }} (sponsored by Lone-Star Beer company)</ref>\n\n==Live performances==\nThe live performance is at the very root of the Texas Country scene.  Enthusiasm is the best descriptor for both band and crowd at a live Texas Country performance. \"It is not an uncommon sight to see clubs all over Texas packed to the rafters; girls and boys in cowboy hats and [[Wrangler Jeans|Wranglers]] [[Country-western two-step|two-step]]ping next to the mosh pit, where [[frat boy|college boys or \"Man Fans\"]] in khakis and college girls pressed up against the stage\".<ref>Lone Star Music. Kevin Fowler Biography. [http://www.lonestarmusic.com/biography.asp?id=86 November 9, 2006] LoneStar Music.</ref> An important factor Texas Country's success is in the frequency of live performances. It is not uncommon for a Texas Country band to tour 200+ dates a year, all, or nearly all, in the State of Texas{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}. This allows the fan to attend a band's show more often, thus interacting with the music on a more personal level.\nPopular venues include, [[Gruene Hall]] (Gruene), [[Billy Bob's]] (Ft.

The winners in 25 categories are nominated and voted on by fans, friends and industry professionals and are awarded the night of the show.  The voting membership has grown to over 32,000 voting members in five years and continues to expand every year.  The awards show is open to the public and fans alike who cheer on their favorite artist/entertainers and radio stations.  Information about the show and voting procedures can be found at https://trrma.net/\n\n==Themes==\nLyrical content is the backbone of Texas country. [[Willie Nelson]], a legendary Country Music Outlaw, inspired his friend [[Waylon Jennings]], an outlaw country music legend himself, who is sometimes cited as an inspiration to present day Texas country musicians, to say, \u201cYour melody goes where the words take you\u201d.<ref>Jennings, Waylon and [[Lenny Kaye]].  ''Waylon: An Autobiography.''  New York: Warner Books, 1976.</ref>\n\nThere are 4 different types of themes in Country Music. These include the following categories: \"It's All Over\" (songs with a core theme of loss or regret), It's Not Working Out (songs with a focus on frustration over a relationship), \"Love and Devotion\" (sappy love songs) and \"The Right Way to Live\" (songs with a dominant theme of pride and homespun wisdom).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wideopencountry.com/chart-shows-4-themes-country-songs-50-years/|title=Chart Shows the 4 Themes in Country Music Over 50 Years|last=Smith|first=Lindi|date=2016-05-03|website=Wide Open Country|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-25}}</ref>\n\nSongs about traditional dance halls, open roads, family farms and hometown bars, along with other illustrations of Texas landscape, are all found in present-day Texas country artists' catalogs.  The ties of landscape and music seem to serve as remembrance and gratitude, as evident in most songs.  Appreciation for surroundings is not the only limitation for this theme.  The \"average man\" and his struggle with nature do appear as well.  \"The songs definitely incorporate a spirit of the times and constitute a spontaneous and fairly comprehensive record of life\".<ref>Clayton, Lawrence. \"Elements of Realism in the Songs of the Cowboy.\" American Renaissance and American West. Ed. Durer, Christopher S. et al. WY: University of Wyoming, 1982.</ref>\n\nA few things Texas Country Music also have in common are topics that are in their songs such as Religion, Patriotism, Red Neck Lifestyles, and Nostalgia. Religion tends to play a big role in Country Music since its roots are in religion \u2013 being born from Traditional Southern Folk and Gospel music.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.westword.com/music/the-ten-biggest-tropes-in-country-music-5694846|title=The ten biggest tropes in country music|last=Rogers|first=Ashley|date=2013-09-05|website=Westword|access-date=2019-03-25}}</ref> Patriotism is also big since they love to talk about how much they love their country. For example, \"[[American Soldier (song)|American Soldier]]\" by [[Toby Keith]] is a great example of patriotism being expressed. Texas Country also involves singing about \"redneck lifestyles\" which includes their country living with trucks, tractors, fishing, and guns. Nostalgia is also considered a characteristic that most songs Country songs have.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origination===\n\nCountry Music from Texas has been popular since the spread of the cowboy culture in the late 1800s. Texas helped popularize Country Music through the world and the state\u2019s rich and varied traditions continue to redefine Country Music.<ref>Hartman, Gary. The History of Texas Music. N.p.: Texas A&M University Press, 2008. Print.</ref>\n\nTexas Country's roots lie in the [[Outlaw country]] movement of the 1960s and 1970s.  Texan artists such as [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Willie Nelson]], and [[David Allan Coe]] retreated from the Nashville Country Music scene to [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Luckenbach, Texas|Luckenbach]], [[College station, tx|College Station]] and [[Houston]]. Other artists who were inspired by this movement included performers like [[Guy Clark]], [[Jerry Jeff Walker]], Gary P. Nunn [[Steve Young (musician)|Steve Young]], [[Kris Kristofferson]], [[Joe Ely]], [[Terry Allen (country singer)|Terry Allen]], [[Steve Earle]],  and [[Townes Van Zandt]]. All these stars have rated higher than 43 on the Texas Music Scene charts{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}.\n\nThese artists were followed in turn by the work of singer-songwriters such as [[Pat Green]], [[Robert Earl Keen]], [[Max Stalling]], [[Wade Bowen]] and [[Cory Morrow]].\n\nWhile the genre has roots in Texas, Oklahoma artists such as [[Jason Boland & The Stragglers|Jason Boland]], [[Stoney LaRue]], [[Mike McClure]], and [[Cross Canadian Ragweed]] have had a major influence on Texas Country. For this reason, \"Red Dirt Music\" is becoming a more popular term for the genre to pay homage to its Oklahoma influence. The term was coined in reference to the miles of red dirt that is common throughout the two states.\n\n===1990s===\n[[Robert Earl Keen]]'s ''[[No. 2 Live Dinner]]'', released in 1996, had it all; comedy accompanied with \"a sharp wit, a laid-back cowboy style, and an eye for detail... combined in [his] songs that are as easy on the ears as they are packed with insight\".<ref>Wolff, Kurt.  ''Country Music: The Rough Guide.''  London: Rough Guides Ltd, 2000.</ref>  Keen's home calling came after a short stint in Nashville, where he quickly became uncomfortable.  His 1996 live album release truly showcased the \u201cwide range\u201d of the talented Texas musician and popularized the single \"The Road Goes On Forever\", a song many music fans regard as the paradigm for Texas 'Country anthems'. [[Joe Ely]] and other Texas musicians have recorded cover versions of \u201cThe Road Goes On Forever\u201d.\n<!--\n RECOMMEND IMMEDIATE REMOVAL:\n no reference to verify these claims can be located.\nThe 1998 release of [[Roger Creager]]\u2019s ''Having Fun All Wrong'' had an immediate impact on the Texas scene.  \u201cThe Everclear Song\u201d reached \u201chit single\u201d status when it quickly spread across Texas college towns and has often been called \"The Anthem of Texas Country.\"{{Fact|date=July 2007}}.\n-->\n\n===2000s and the Texas influence in Nashville===\n\n[[Cory Morrow]], a [[Houston]] native, had been on the Texas scene since the mid-90s. With the release of his fourth album ''Outside the Lines'', Morrow found more mainstream success on the Country Music charts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kbec.com/texas-music-facts-tales/|title=Texas Music Facts and Some Tales|last=kbec|date=2017-10-24|website=KBEC 1390|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-25}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n[[Pat Green]], also an artist from Texas, began his career as part of the Texas Country scene later went on to widespread commercial success with gold album ''[[Wave on Wave]]'' after switching to a  \"Shania Twain/ Garth Brooks\" Nashville style of Country Music.  The album's title track hit No. 3 on the U.S. ''Billboard's'' Hot Country Songs chart and won a [[Grammy]] nomination for Best Country Song.\n\n[[Kevin Fowler]], a former hair-metal/glam rocker was [[Dangerous Toys]] guitarist from the late 1980s until 1993, followed by his own founding of Thunderfoot, a Southern rock band based out of Austin. Originally from [[Amarillo]], he self-released his country debut album ''One For The Road'' in 1997. This followed with his smash independent follow-up album, ''Beer, Bait, and Ammo''.  He has since found national success, on a major label.\n\nTexas Country's influence continues to be felt in the mainstream music genre with artists such as [[Jack Ingram]], who had already established a name for himself in Texas Country, who won a [[CMT Music Award]] in 2007 and the 2008 [[Academy of Country Music]] award for New Male Vocalist of the Year.  He has also scored top 25 singles on ''Billboard's'' Hot Country Songs chart with songs such as \"[[Love You (Jack Ingram song)|Love You]]\" and his cover of [[Hinder|Hinder's]] \"[[Lips of an Angel]]\".  Another one of his singles, \"[[Wherever You Are (Jack Ingram song)|Wherever You Are]]\", went to number one on the Billboard Chart.\n\nMany independent artists, which is the fastest growing segment of the global recorded music business, <ref>https://www.forbes.com/sites/melissamdaniels/2019/07/10/for-independent-musicians-goingyour-own-way-is-finally-starting-to-pay-off/#45980f4f14f2</ref> have gained commercial success through the Texas music scene, such as albums debuting in the Top 5 of Billboard's Top Country Album sales. <ref>https://www.houstonpress.com/music/indie-texas-country-artists-racking-up-major-league-sales-8721118</ref>\n\n==Radio stations==\nTexas Country is unique in that radio stations throughout Texas have embraced the subgenre and regularly mix Texas country into a Country radio format:\n\n===Internet===\n*[[Texas Country Mix (Internet Radio)]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.txcountrymix.com/|title=Texas Country Mix (Internet Radio)}}</ref>\n*[[GotRadio Texas Best (Internet Radio)]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gotradio.com/|title=GotRadio Texas Best (Internet Radio)}}</ref>\n\n===Terrestrial (AM/FM)===\n*[[KBSO|KBSO 94.7 Corpus Christi, Texas]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://947jalapenocountry.com|title=KBSO 94.7 Corpus Christi, Texas}}</ref>\n*[[KFLP-FM|KFLP 106.1 Floydada/Plainview/Lubbock, Texas]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://1061flipfm.com|title=KFLP 106.1 Floydada/Plainview/Lubbock, Texas}}</ref>\n*[[KFWR|KFWR 95.9 Fort Worth, Texas]]\n*[[KFYN-FM|KFYN 104.3 Paris, Texas]]\n*[[KILT-FM|KILT 100.3 HD3 Houston, Texas]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thebull.radio.com|title=KILT 100.3 HD3 Houston, Texas}}</ref>\n*[[KKBQ|KKBQ 92.9 HD3 Pasadena, Texas]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thenew93q.com|title=KKBQ 92.9 HD3 Pasadena, Texas}}</ref>\n*[[KKCN|KKCN 103.1 San Angelo, Texas]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://103kkcn.com|title=KKCN 103.1 San Angelo, Texas}}</ref>\n*[[KNBT|KNBT 92.1 New Braunfels, Texas]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.knbt.fm|title=KNBT 92.1 New Braunfels, Texas}}</ref>\n*[[KOLI|KOLI 94.9 Wichita Falls, Texas]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://949theoutlaw.com|title=KOLI 94.9 Wichita Falls, Texas}}</ref>\n*[[KOKE-FM|KOKE 99.3/98.5 Austin, Texas]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kokefm.com|title=KOKE 99.3/98.5 Austin, Texas}}</ref>\n*[[KORA|KORA 98.3 Bryan/College Station, Texas]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://983korafm.com|title=KORA 98.3 Bryan/College Station, Texas}}</ref>\n*[[KPLX|KPLX 99.5 Dallas/Ft.

Texas Country is known for fusing [[Neotraditional country|neotraditional country]] with the outspoken, care-free views of [[outlaw country]]. Texas Country blends these sub-genres with a [[common people|\"common working man\"]] theme and witty undertones, these often combine with a stripped down music sound.\n\nNeither the location of birth nor the location of upbringing seems to calculate in the definition of a Texas Country artist, as long as the origin is not in the corporate Nashville scene as the genre tends to be anti-Nashville. The genre differentiates from Nashville country with its rejection of pop influences that is found in Nashville Country recently, but does not necessarily mean the artist/group is Texas based.  For example, [[Chris Knight (musician)|Chris Knight]] is considered by some to be a Texas Country musician, despite his [[Kentucky]] ties. [[Adam Hood]], an [[Alabama]] native, also has had success in the genre. Even international musicians, such as [[Alberta, Canada]] native [[Corb Lund]], have been successful in the Texas Country scene. This just shows how many musicians all over the world have adopted the Texas sound.\n\n==Instrumentation==\n{{unsourced section|date=July 2019}}\nThe [[Steel-string guitar|acoustic guitar]] is essential in Texas Country Music. However, the use of [[electric guitar]]s, [[steel guitar]]s or [[pedal steel guitar]]s in the genre is not uncommon. [[bass guitar|Bass]] and [[percussion]] are used in live performances. The sounds of [[piano]], [[baritone guitar]], [[banjo]], [[accordion]], [[fiddle]] or [[harmonica]] on studio recordings are the norm for the genre.\n\n==Vocals==\nThe line of delineation for vocals is unclear. Traditionally, the Texas Country scene has been a male dominated genre, however many women have had chart success in recent years. The Texas \"anthem\" is a common song type, referencing and sometimes embellishing on the different positive characteristics of the state. Many of these types of songs have been popular on the Texas Music Charts.<ref>[http://www.countryradioclassics.com/index.php/2007/09/21/texas-national-anthem-voting/ TX National Anthem voting ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703153140/http://www.countryradioclassics.com/index.php/2007/09/21/texas-national-anthem-voting |date=2008-07-03 }} (sponsored by Lone-Star Beer company)</ref>\n\n==Live performances==\nThe live performance is at the very root of the Texas Country scene.  Enthusiasm is the best descriptor for both band and crowd at a live Texas Country performance. \"It is not an uncommon sight to see clubs all over Texas packed to the rafters; girls and boys in cowboy hats and [[Wrangler Jeans|Wranglers]] [[Country-western two-step|two-step]]ping next to the mosh pit, where [[frat boy|college boys or \"Man Fans\"]] in khakis and college girls pressed up against the stage\".<ref>Lone Star Music. Kevin Fowler Biography. [http://www.lonestarmusic.com/biography.asp?id=86 November 9, 2006] LoneStar Music.</ref> An important factor Texas Country's success is in the frequency of live performances. It is not uncommon for a Texas Country band to tour 200+ dates a year, all, or nearly all, in the State of Texas{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}. This allows the fan to attend a band's show more often, thus interacting with the music on a more personal level.\nPopular venues include, [[Gruene Hall]] (Gruene), [[Billy Bob's]] (Ft.

The winners in 25 categories are nominated and voted on by fans, friends and industry professionals and are awarded the night of the show.  The voting membership has grown to over 32,000 voting members in five years and continues to expand every year.  The awards show is open to the public and fans alike who cheer on their favorite artist/entertainers and radio stations.  Information about the show and voting procedures can be found at https://trrma.net/\n\n==Themes==\nLyrical content is the backbone of Texas country. [[Willie Nelson]], a legendary Country Music Outlaw, inspired his friend [[Waylon Jennings]], an outlaw country music legend himself, who is sometimes cited as an inspiration to present day Texas country musicians, to say, \u201cYour melody goes where the words take you\u201d.<ref>Jennings, Waylon and [[Lenny Kaye]].  ''Waylon: An Autobiography.''  New York: Warner Books, 1976.</ref>\n\nThere are 4 different types of themes in Country Music. These include the following categories: \"It's All Over\" (songs with a core theme of loss or regret), It's Not Working Out (songs with a focus on frustration over a relationship), \"Love and Devotion\" (sappy love songs) and \"The Right Way to Live\" (songs with a dominant theme of pride and homespun wisdom).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wideopencountry.com/chart-shows-4-themes-country-songs-50-years/|title=Chart Shows the 4 Themes in Country Music Over 50 Years|last=Smith|first=Lindi|date=2016-05-03|website=Wide Open Country|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-25}}</ref>\n\nSongs about traditional dance halls, open roads, family farms and hometown bars, along with other illustrations of Texas landscape, are all found in present-day Texas country artists' catalogs.  The ties of landscape and music seem to serve as remembrance and gratitude, as evident in most songs.  Appreciation for surroundings is not the only limitation for this theme.  The \"average man\" and his struggle with nature do appear as well.  \"The songs definitely incorporate a spirit of the times and constitute a spontaneous and fairly comprehensive record of life\".<ref>Clayton, Lawrence. \"Elements of Realism in the Songs of the Cowboy.\" American Renaissance and American West. Ed. Durer, Christopher S. et al. WY: University of Wyoming, 1982.</ref>\n\nA few things Texas Country Music also have in common are topics that are in their songs such as Religion, Patriotism, Red Neck Lifestyles, and Nostalgia. Religion tends to play a big role in Country Music since its roots are in religion \u2013 being born from Traditional Southern Folk and Gospel music.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.westword.com/music/the-ten-biggest-tropes-in-country-music-5694846|title=The ten biggest tropes in country music|last=Rogers|first=Ashley|date=2013-09-05|website=Westword|access-date=2019-03-25}}</ref> Patriotism is also big since they love to talk about how much they love their country. For example, \"[[American Soldier (song)|American Soldier]]\" by [[Toby Keith]] is a great example of patriotism being expressed. Texas Country also involves singing about \"redneck lifestyles\" which includes their country living with trucks, tractors, fishing, and guns. Nostalgia is also considered a characteristic that most songs Country songs have.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origination===\n\nCountry Music from Texas has been popular since the spread of the cowboy culture in the late 1800s. Texas helped popularize Country Music through the world and the state\u2019s rich and varied traditions continue to redefine Country Music.<ref>Hartman, Gary. The History of Texas Music. N.p.: Texas A&M University Press, 2008. Print.</ref>\n\nTexas Country's roots lie in the [[Outlaw country]] movement of the 1960s and 1970s.  Texan artists such as [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Willie Nelson]], and [[David Allan Coe]] retreated from the Nashville Country Music scene to [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Luckenbach, Texas|Luckenbach]], [[College station, tx|College Station]] and [[Houston]]. Other artists who were inspired by this movement included performers like [[Guy Clark]], [[Jerry Jeff Walker]], Gary P. Nunn [[Steve Young (musician)|Steve Young]], [[Kris Kristofferson]], [[Joe Ely]], [[Terry Allen (country singer)|Terry Allen]], [[Steve Earle]],  and [[Townes Van Zandt]]. All these stars have rated higher than 43 on the Texas Music Scene charts{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}.\n\nThese artists were followed in turn by the work of singer-songwriters such as [[Pat Green]], [[Robert Earl Keen]], [[Max Stalling]], [[Wade Bowen]] and [[Cory Morrow]].\n\nWhile the genre has roots in Texas, Oklahoma artists such as [[Jason Boland & The Stragglers|Jason Boland]], [[Stoney LaRue]], [[Mike McClure]], and [[Cross Canadian Ragweed]] have had a major influence on Texas Country. For this reason, \"Red Dirt Music\" is becoming a more popular term for the genre to pay homage to its Oklahoma influence. The term was coined in reference to the miles of red dirt that is common throughout the two states.\n\n===1990s===\n[[Robert Earl Keen]]'s ''[[No. 2 Live Dinner]]'', released in 1996, had it all; comedy accompanied with \"a sharp wit, a laid-back cowboy style, and an eye for detail... combined in [his] songs that are as easy on the ears as they are packed with insight\".<ref>Wolff, Kurt.  ''Country Music: The Rough Guide.''  London: Rough Guides Ltd, 2000.</ref>  Keen's home calling came after a short stint in Nashville, where he quickly became uncomfortable.  His 1996 live album release truly showcased the \u201cwide range\u201d of the talented Texas musician and popularized the single \"The Road Goes On Forever\", a song many music fans regard as the paradigm for Texas 'Country anthems'. [[Joe Ely]] and other Texas musicians have recorded cover versions of \u201cThe Road Goes On Forever\u201d.\n<!--\n RECOMMEND IMMEDIATE REMOVAL:\n no reference to verify these claims can be located.\nThe 1998 release of [[Roger Creager]]\u2019s ''Having Fun All Wrong'' had an immediate impact on the Texas scene.  \u201cThe Everclear Song\u201d reached \u201chit single\u201d status when it quickly spread across Texas college towns and has often been called \"The Anthem of Texas Country.\"{{Fact|date=July 2007}}.\n-->\n\n===2000s and the Texas influence in Nashville===\n\n[[Cory Morrow]], a [[Houston]] native, had been on the Texas scene since the mid-90s. With the release of his fourth album ''Outside the Lines'', Morrow found more mainstream success on the Country Music charts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kbec.com/texas-music-facts-tales/|title=Texas Music Facts and Some Tales|last=kbec|date=2017-10-24|website=KBEC 1390|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-25}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n[[Pat Green]], also an artist from Texas, began his career as part of the Texas Country scene later went on to widespread commercial success with gold album ''[[Wave on Wave]]'' after switching to a  \"Shania Twain/ Garth Brooks\" Nashville style of Country Music.  The album's title track hit No. 3 on the U.S. ''Billboard's'' Hot Country Songs chart and won a [[Grammy]] nomination for Best Country Song.\n\n[[Kevin Fowler]], a former hair-metal/glam rocker was [[Dangerous Toys]] guitarist from the late 1980s until 1993, followed by his own founding of Thunderfoot, a Southern rock band based out of Austin. Originally from [[Amarillo]], he self-released his country debut album ''One For The Road'' in 1997. This followed with his smash independent follow-up album, ''Beer, Bait, and Ammo''.  He has since found national success, on a major label.\n\nTexas Country's influence continues to be felt in the mainstream music genre with artists such as [[Jack Ingram]], who had already established a name for himself in Texas Country, who won a [[CMT Music Award]] in 2007 and the 2008 [[Academy of Country Music]] award for New Male Vocalist of the Year.  He has also scored top 25 singles on ''Billboard's'' Hot Country Songs chart with songs such as \"[[Love You (Jack Ingram song)|Love You]]\" and his cover of [[Hinder|Hinder's]] \"[[Lips of an Angel]]\".
