Additionally, many liner notes from the band's albums list attorney [[Bertis Downs]] and manager [[Jefferson Holt]] as non-musical members.  One of the first [[alternative rock]] bands, R.E.M. was noted for Buck's ringing, [[arpeggiated]] guitar style, Stipe's distinctive vocal quality, unique stage presence and obscure lyrics, Mills's melodic basslines and backing vocals, and Berry's tight, economical drumming. In the early 1990s, other [[alternative rock]] acts such as [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] and [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]] viewed R.E.M. as a pioneer of the genre. After Berry left the band in 1997, through some changes in musical style to include [[electronic music]] and [[pop rock]] sounds, the band continued its career in the 2000s with mixed critical and commercial success. The band broke up amicably in 2011 with members devoting time on solo projects despite having sold more than 85 million records worldwide and becoming one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|world's best-selling music artists]].\n\nR.E.M. released its first single, \"[[Radio Free Europe (song)|Radio Free Europe]]\", in 1981 on the independent record label [[Hib-Tone]]. It was followed by the ''[[Chronic Town]]'' [[Extended play|EP]] in 1982, the band's first release on [[I.R.S. Records]]. In 1983, the group released its critically acclaimed debut album, ''[[Murmur (album)|Murmur]]'', and built its reputation over the next few years through subsequent releases each year from 1984 to 1988: ''[[Reckoning (R.E.M. album)|Reckoning]]'', ''[[Fables of the Reconstruction]]'', ''[[Lifes Rich Pageant]]'', ''[[Document (album)|Document]]'' and ''[[Green (R.E.M. album)|Green]]'', including an intermittent b-side compilation ''[[Dead Letter Office (album)|Dead Letter Office]]''. With constant touring, and the support of [[campus radio|college radio]], following years of underground success, R.E.M. achieved a mainstream hit with the 1987 single \"[[The One I Love (R.E.M. song)|The One I Love]]\". The group signed to [[Warner Bros. Records]] in 1988, and began to espouse political and environmental concerns while playing large arenas worldwide.\n\nR.E.M.'s most commercially successful albums, ''[[Out of Time (album)|Out of Time]]'' (1991) and ''[[Automatic for the People]]'' (1992), brought it to the vanguard of alternative rock just as it was becoming mainstream. ''Out of Time'' received seven nominations at the [[34th Annual Grammy Awards]], and lead single \"[[Losing My Religion]]\", was R.E.M.'s highest-charting and best-selling hit. R.E.M.'s 1994 album ''[[Monster (R.E.M. album)|Monster]]'' continued its run of success. The band began its first tour in six years to support the album; the tour was marred by medical emergencies suffered by three of the band members. In 1996, R.E.M. re-signed with Warner Bros. for a reported US$80&nbsp;million, at the time the most expensive recording contract in history. The tour however was productive and the band recorded the following album mostly on soundchecks. The resulting record, ''[[New Adventures in Hi-Fi]]'' (1996) is hailed as the band's last great album and members' favourite one, growing in cult status in the years following its release. Berry left the band the following year, and Stipe, Buck, and Mills continued as a trio.\n\nAfter the electronic experimental direction of ''[[Up (R.E.M. album)|Up]]'' (1998) that was commercially unsuccessful, ''[[Reveal (R.E.M. album)|Reveal]]'' (2001) was referred as \"a conscious return to their classic sound\" which received general acclaim. In 2007, the band was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], in its first year of eligibility. In order to \"redeem themselves\" after the lukewarm reception of ''[[Around the Sun]]'' (2004), the band released the well-received albums ''[[Accelerate (R.E.M. album)|Accelerate]]'' (2008) and ''[[Collapse into Now]]'' (2011). R.E.M. disbanded amicably in September 2011, with former members having continued with various musical projects, and several live and archival albums have been released.\n\n==History==\n===1980\u20131982: Formation and first releases===\nIn January 1980, [[Peter Buck]] met [[Michael Stipe]] in [[Wuxtry Records]], the Athens record store where Buck worked.

Additionally, many liner notes from the band's albums list attorney [[Bertis Downs]] and manager [[Jefferson Holt]] as non-musical members.  One of the first [[alternative rock]] bands, R.E.M. was noted for Buck's ringing, [[arpeggiated]] guitar style, Stipe's distinctive vocal quality, unique stage presence and obscure lyrics, Mills's melodic basslines and backing vocals, and Berry's tight, economical drumming. In the early 1990s, other [[alternative rock]] acts such as [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] and [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]] viewed R.E.M. as a pioneer of the genre. After Berry left the band in 1997, through some changes in musical style to include [[electronic music]] and [[pop rock]] sounds, the band continued its career in the 2000s with mixed critical and commercial success. The band broke up amicably in 2011 with members devoting time on solo projects despite having sold more than 85 million records worldwide and becoming one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|world's best-selling music artists]].\n\nR.E.M. released its first single, \"[[Radio Free Europe (song)|Radio Free Europe]]\", in 1981 on the independent record label [[Hib-Tone]]. It was followed by the ''[[Chronic Town]]'' [[Extended play|EP]] in 1982, the band's first release on [[I.R.S. Records]]. In 1983, the group released its critically acclaimed debut album, ''[[Murmur (album)|Murmur]]'', and built its reputation over the next few years through subsequent releases each year from 1984 to 1988: ''[[Reckoning (R.E.M. album)|Reckoning]]'', ''[[Fables of the Reconstruction]]'', ''[[Lifes Rich Pageant]]'', ''[[Document (album)|Document]]'' and ''[[Green (R.E.M. album)|Green]]'', including an intermittent b-side compilation ''[[Dead Letter Office (album)|Dead Letter Office]]''. With constant touring, and the support of [[campus radio|college radio]], following years of underground success, R.E.M. achieved a mainstream hit with the 1987 single \"[[The One I Love (R.E.M. song)|The One I Love]]\". The group signed to [[Warner Bros. Records]] in 1988, and began to espouse political and environmental concerns while playing large arenas worldwide.\n\nR.E.M.'s most commercially successful albums, ''[[Out of Time (album)|Out of Time]]'' (1991) and ''[[Automatic for the People]]'' (1992), brought it to the vanguard of alternative rock just as it was becoming mainstream. ''Out of Time'' received seven nominations at the [[34th Annual Grammy Awards]], and lead single \"[[Losing My Religion]]\", was R.E.M.'s highest-charting and best-selling hit. R.E.M.'s 1994 album ''[[Monster (R.E.M. album)|Monster]]'' continued its run of success. The band began its first tour in six years to support the album; the tour was marred by medical emergencies suffered by three of the band members. In 1996, R.E.M. re-signed with Warner Bros. for a reported US$80&nbsp;million, at the time the most expensive recording contract in history. The tour however was productive and the band recorded the following album mostly on soundchecks. The resulting record, ''[[New Adventures in Hi-Fi]]'' (1996) is hailed as the band's last great album and members' favourite one, growing in cult status in the years following its release. Berry left the band the following year, and Stipe, Buck, and Mills continued as a trio.\n\nAfter the electronic experimental direction of ''[[Up (R.E.M. album)|Up]]'' (1998) that was commercially unsuccessful, ''[[Reveal (R.E.M. album)|Reveal]]'' (2001) was referred as \"a conscious return to their classic sound\" which received general acclaim. In 2007, the band was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], in its first year of eligibility. In order to \"redeem themselves\" after the lukewarm reception of ''[[Around the Sun]]'' (2004), the band released the well-received albums ''[[Accelerate (R.E.M. album)|Accelerate]]'' (2008) and ''[[Collapse into Now]]'' (2011). R.E.M. disbanded amicably in September 2011, with former members having continued with various musical projects, and several live and archival albums have been released.\n\n==History==\n===1980\u20131982: Formation and first releases===\nIn January 1980, [[Peter Buck]] met [[Michael Stipe]] in [[Wuxtry Records]], the Athens record store where Buck worked.

It is a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''[[Three's Company]]'' and loosely based on the [[British sitcom]] ''[[George and Mildred]]'', which was itself a spin-off of ''[[Man About the House]]'', on which ''Three's Company'' was based.\n\nIt was taped at [[CBS Television City]] in the [[Fairfax District, Los Angeles|Fairfax District]] of [[Los Angeles]], where its parent series, ''Three's Company'', was taping at the time, from February to April 1979 (Season 1) and from July 1979 to February 1980 (Season 2).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbstelevisioncity.com/shows|title=Shows - CBS Television City|work=cbstelevisioncity.com}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe series focused on middle-aged couple [[Stanley Roper|Stanley]] ([[Norman Fell]]) and [[Helen Roper]] ([[Audra Lindley]]), who were landlords to [[Jack Tripper|Jack]], [[Janet Wood|Janet]] and [[Chrissy Snow|Chrissy]] on ''Three's Company''.\n\nIn this spin-off, the Ropers have sold their apartment building in the ''Three's Company'' episode \"An Anniversary Surprise\" (season 3, episode 20) to live in the upmarket community of [[Cheviot Hills, Los Angeles, California|Cheviot Hills]], where the social-climbing Helen struggled to fit in with her neighbors. Stanley made little attempt to fit in with the standards of the community, thereby causing Helen much embarrassment.\n\nAs was the case during their time on ''Three's Company'', opening credits for ''The Ropers'' alternate between Audra Lindley and Norman Fell credited first.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main characters===\n* '''[[Stanley Roper]]''' ([[Norman Fell]]) (seasons 1\u20132)\u2014A lower-middle-class, frugal, and often embarrassing retiree, who moved to [[Cheviot Hills, Los Angeles|Cheviot Hills]] after he is duped into buying a townhouse\n* '''[[Helen Roper]]''' ([[Audra Lindley]]) (seasons 1\u20132)\u2014A sexually frustrated, social-climbing middle-aged woman who tries to fit into the community despite her husband Stanley's constant boorishness. Despite her attempts to fit in, she often proves herself to be as bumbling as her husband.\n* '''Jeffrey P. Brookes III''' ([[Jeffrey Tambor]]) (seasons 1\u20132)\u2014The snobbish [[Real estate broker|realtor]] who is also the Ropers' next-door neighbor.\n* '''Anne Brookes''' ([[Patty McCormack|Patricia McCormack]]) (seasons 1\u20132)\u2014Brookes' long-suffering, down-to-earth homemaker wife, who looks after the house and their young son David. She and Helen become friendly, despite their husbands' frequently adversarial relationship with one another.\n* '''David Brookes''' (Evan Cohen) (seasons 1\u20132)\u2014Jeffrey and Anne Brookes' 7-year-old son who is always tempted to bother Mr. Roper, which his parents don't approve.\n\n===Recurring characters===\n* '''Jenny Ballinger''' ([[Stevie Vallance|Louise Vallance]]) (season 2)\u2014A young woman who had been living in the Ropers' storeroom\n* '''Ethel Ambrewster''' ([[Dena Dietrich]]) (seasons 1\u20132)\u2014Helen's snobby elder sister; gives her an air kiss every time she sees Helen.\n* '''Hubert Ambrewster''' ([[Rod Colbin]])\u2014Ethel's husband and Helen's brother-in-law\n* '''Debbie Hopper''' ([[Lois Hamilton|Lois Areno]]) (seasons 1\u20132)\u2014The girl Stanley sees at the hot tub in the neighborhood\n* '''Joey''' ([[Richard B.

In early 1977, Silverman approached Fell and Lindley with the subject of doing a spin-off from the show after its first full season wrapped in the spring of 1978. Both actors as well as the ''Three's Company'' producers begged off as the show had yet to prove itself for an entire season. With the show's continued success in its second season, however, the idea was brought up again in 1978, this time by ''Three's Company's'' own producers as well as new ABC head Tony Thomopolous (Silverman had gone to [[NBC]]). The idea intrigued Lindley, but Fell was extremely reluctant, as he was satisfied with his role on a show that was already a proven hit. Fell feared that a spin-off would be unsuccessful and thus put him out of a good role and job. To alleviate his fears, ''Three's Company'' producers contractually promised Fell that they would give the new series a year to prove itself. If the show were to be canceled prior to that time, then he and Lindley would return to ''Three's Company''. A reluctant Fell agreed to the new terms.\n\nLike ''Three's Company'', ''The Ropers'' was introduced as a late season replacement series in the spring of 1979 premiering the same night as ''Three's Company'' on ABC's successful Tuesday night lineup, airing at 10{{nbsp}}pm. In its first season, the [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] for the show were very high (the show finished at #8 for the 1978\u201379 season), and had the second-highest series premiere rating at the time.<ref name=ourdoor>{{cite book|last=Mann|first=Chris |title=Come and Knock on Our Door: A Hers and Hers and His Guide to Three's Company|publisher=Macmillan|year=1998|isbn=0-312-16803-9|page=113}}</ref> After the season premiere, ''Three's Company'' went on hiatus, but ''The Ropers'' still did well. ABC reran the episodes over the summer of 1979 (in August on Sundays) where they continued to achieve high ratings leading many to believe that the series would enjoy a long run.\n\n== Cancellation ==\nAt the beginning of the 1979\u201380 season, ABC moved the show to Saturdays at 8{{nbsp}}pm, resulting in an audience drop that put it near the bottom of the ratings. Being placed on Saturday nights, rather than on the ABC Tuesday night lineup, caused an immediate fall into the bottom ten (#52 out of 61 shows for the week of September 17\u201323, its second week of the season) as the show was in direct competition with the NBC show ''[[CHiPs]]''. The show later moved to 8:30{{nbsp}}pm on Saturdays by January 1980. The move upset Fell to the point that he actually went to ABC headquarters in New York to plead with the network to move the show to a better time slot. His effort was in vain, however, and the show continued to pull in low ratings. The drop in ratings and the fact that the show wasn't pulling in the key young demographic audience led to announcement of the show's cancellation by ABC in May 1980. The last three episodes aired Thursdays at 9:30{{nbsp}}pm after ''[[Barney Miller]]'' in May 1980. Audra Lindley stated in Chris Mann's 1997 book about ''Three's Company'' that she was surprised that ''The Ropers'' had been canceled after a late-season surge in the series ratings had allowed it to finish the 1979\u201380 season at number 25<ref name=ourdoor/>; the Nielsen ratings for that year, however, list the series ''[[Soap (TV series)|Soap]]'' at number 25.{{or|date=September 2019}}\n\nWith the series canceled, Fell approached ''Three's Company'' producers about the Ropers returning to the show. However, during the time ''The Ropers'' was on the air, the landlord characters had been replaced on ''Three's Company'' by Ralph Furley ([[Don Knotts]]). The addition had worked well and ''Three's Company'' had retained its popularity. The idea of returning Fell and Lindley to their original ''Three's Company'' roles was undesirable to producers and ABC, mainly because they had one character playing the landlord role now as opposed to two, which would require more money to be paid out per episode; the cancellation of ''The Ropers'' came just as Suzanne Somers began to renegotiate her contract, which would lead to her very public contract dispute during the 1980\u201381 television season that led to her departure from the series. The cancellation of ''The Ropers'' came just one month after the one-year contractual deadline had passed. Fell would later state that he always believed the decision to pull the plug on the show had been made much earlier, but that the network deliberately postponed making the cancellation official until after the one-year mark specifically to be relieved of the obligation to allow Fell and Lindley to return to ''Three's Company''. There was an attempt by producers to sell the show to Silverman over at NBC; Silverman, however, passed on it too.\n\nDespite the hard feelings, in March 1981 both Fell and Lindley made one final guest appearance on ''Three's Company'' (in Season 5, Episode #18 \"Night of The Ropers\") nearly a year after the end of their own series before the characters were retired for good. For audiences, it was a chance to see all of the three landlord characters &ndash; played by Fell, Lindley, and Knotts &ndash; on the same stage.\n\nTambor appeared on ''Three's Company'' that same season playing a different character, a wealthy but unwelcome suitor of Chrissy's cousin Cindy (Season 5, Episode #13). Tambor also made other guest appearances on ''Three's Company,'' portraying different characters.\n\nThe show was ranked number two on ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's \"Top 10 Worst TV Spin-Offs\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1845866_1846026_1845969,00.html|title=The Ropers, 1979\u201380 \u2013 Top 10 Worst TV Spin-Offs|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|accessdate=2010-12-30|date=October 1, 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2002 ''[[TV Guide]]'' named ''The Ropers'' the 49th worst TV series of all time.<ref>{{cite book|title=TV Guide Book of Lists|url=https://archive.org/details/tvguidebookoflis0000unse|url-access=registration|year=2007|publisher=Running Press|isbn=0-7624-3007-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/tvguidebookoflis0000unse/page/181 181]}}</ref>\n\n== Proposed spinoff ==\nIn 1986, distributor D. L. Taffner revealed its plans for a spinoff of ''The Ropers'' called ''Three Apartments''. The spinoff would again star Fell and Lindley, this time as landlords of a three-unit apartment building. The show was offered as either a two-year, 44-episode package in syndication starting April 1987, or as a 52-episode package on NBC-owned station checkerboards beginning in September 1987. Guest stars would include [[John Ritter]], [[Joyce DeWitt]], [[Richard Kline]], and [[Don Knotts]] from ''Three's Company''; [[Robert Mandan]] from ''[[Three's a Crowd]]''; and [[Jm J. Bullock]] and [[Nancy Dussault]] from ''[[Too Close for Comfort]]''/''The Ted Knight Show''.

Two episodes of the series, however, play in the syndication package of ''Three's Company''. When initially offered in syndication, the series ran under the title '''''Three's Company's Friends, The Ropers'''''. That version used an instrumental version of the original series' theme song. Six episodes of the series were aired on [[TV Land]] in September 2006, and four episodes were aired on [[WGN America]] in October 2008.\n\nBeginning in January 2011 [[Antenna TV]], a television network designed for digital television subchannels and owned by [[Tribune Broadcasting]], aired the sitcom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.sitcomsonline.com/2010/12/our-exclusive-interview-with-antenna.html|title=Our Exclusive Interview with Antenna TV's Sean Compton; KTLA Preview of Antenna TV; 2011 SAG Nominations - SitcomsOnline.com News Blog|work=sitcomsonline.com}}</ref> The series started on Tuesday, February 15, 2011, and went through one entire rotation of all episodes before being removed from the lineup.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.sitcomsonline.com/2011/01/antenna-tv-premieres-ropers-on-feb-15.html|title=Antenna TV Premieres The Ropers on Feb. 15, 2011; Remembering Character Actor Peter Hobbs - SitcomsOnline.com News Blog|work=sitcomsonline.com}}</ref> On August 29, 2011, the show returned to the lineup as the ''Three's Company'' cycle again came to the point of the series where the Ropers left.\n\nAntenna TV usually shows back-to-back episodes of ''Three's Company''.

Stanley made little attempt to fit in with the standards of the community, thereby causing Helen much embarrassment.\n\nAs was the case during their time on ''Three's Company'', opening credits for ''The Ropers'' alternate between Audra Lindley and Norman Fell credited first.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main characters===\n* '''[[Stanley Roper]]''' ([[Norman Fell]]) (seasons 1\u20132)\u2014A lower-middle-class, frugal, and often embarrassing retiree, who moved to [[Cheviot Hills, Los Angeles|Cheviot Hills]] after he is duped into buying a townhouse\n* '''[[Helen Roper]]''' ([[Audra Lindley]]) (seasons 1\u20132)\u2014A sexually frustrated, social-climbing middle-aged woman who tries to fit into the community despite her husband Stanley's constant boorishness.

In early 1977, Silverman approached Fell and Lindley with the subject of doing a spin-off from the show after its first full season wrapped in the spring of 1978. Both actors as well as the ''Three's Company'' producers begged off as the show had yet to prove itself for an entire season. With the show's continued success in its second season, however, the idea was brought up again in 1978, this time by ''Three's Company's'' own producers as well as new ABC head Tony Thomopolous (Silverman had gone to [[NBC]]). The idea intrigued Lindley, but Fell was extremely reluctant, as he was satisfied with his role on a show that was already a proven hit. Fell feared that a spin-off would be unsuccessful and thus put him out of a good role and job. To alleviate his fears, ''Three's Company'' producers contractually promised Fell that they would give the new series a year to prove itself. If the show were to be canceled prior to that time, then he and Lindley would return to ''Three's Company''. A reluctant Fell agreed to the new terms.\n\nLike ''Three's Company'', ''The Ropers'' was introduced as a late season replacement series in the spring of 1979 premiering the same night as ''Three's Company'' on ABC's successful Tuesday night lineup, airing at 10{{nbsp}}pm. In its first season, the [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] for the show were very high (the show finished at #8 for the 1978\u201379 season), and had the second-highest series premiere rating at the time.<ref name=ourdoor>{{cite book|last=Mann|first=Chris |title=Come and Knock on Our Door: A Hers and Hers and His Guide to Three's Company|publisher=Macmillan|year=1998|isbn=0-312-16803-9|page=113}}</ref> After the season premiere, ''Three's Company'' went on hiatus, but ''The Ropers'' still did well. ABC reran the episodes over the summer of 1979 (in August on Sundays) where they continued to achieve high ratings leading many to believe that the series would enjoy a long run.\n\n== Cancellation ==\nAt the beginning of the 1979\u201380 season, ABC moved the show to Saturdays at 8{{nbsp}}pm, resulting in an audience drop that put it near the bottom of the ratings. Being placed on Saturday nights, rather than on the ABC Tuesday night lineup, caused an immediate fall into the bottom ten (#52 out of 61 shows for the week of September 17\u201323, its second week of the season) as the show was in direct competition with the NBC show ''[[CHiPs]]''. The show later moved to 8:30{{nbsp}}pm on Saturdays by January 1980. The move upset Fell to the point that he actually went to ABC headquarters in New York to plead with the network to move the show to a better time slot. His effort was in vain, however, and the show continued to pull in low ratings. The drop in ratings and the fact that the show wasn't pulling in the key young demographic audience led to announcement of the show's cancellation by ABC in May 1980. The last three episodes aired Thursdays at 9:30{{nbsp}}pm after ''[[Barney Miller]]'' in May 1980. Audra Lindley stated in Chris Mann's 1997 book about ''Three's Company'' that she was surprised that ''The Ropers'' had been canceled after a late-season surge in the series ratings had allowed it to finish the 1979\u201380 season at number 25<ref name=ourdoor/>; the Nielsen ratings for that year, however, list the series ''[[Soap (TV series)|Soap]]'' at number 25.{{or|date=September 2019}}\n\nWith the series canceled, Fell approached ''Three's Company'' producers about the Ropers returning to the show. However, during the time ''The Ropers'' was on the air, the landlord characters had been replaced on ''Three's Company'' by Ralph Furley ([[Don Knotts]]). The addition had worked well and ''Three's Company'' had retained its popularity. The idea of returning Fell and Lindley to their original ''Three's Company'' roles was undesirable to producers and ABC, mainly because they had one character playing the landlord role now as opposed to two, which would require more money to be paid out per episode; the cancellation of ''The Ropers'' came just as Suzanne Somers began to renegotiate her contract, which would lead to her very public contract dispute during the 1980\u201381 television season that led to her departure from the series. The cancellation of ''The Ropers'' came just one month after the one-year contractual deadline had passed. Fell would later state that he always believed the decision to pull the plug on the show had been made much earlier, but that the network deliberately postponed making the cancellation official until after the one-year mark specifically to be relieved of the obligation to allow Fell and Lindley to return to ''Three's Company''. There was an attempt by producers to sell the show to Silverman over at NBC; Silverman, however, passed on it too.\n\nDespite the hard feelings, in March 1981 both Fell and Lindley made one final guest appearance on ''Three's Company'' (in Season 5, Episode #18 \"Night of The Ropers\") nearly a year after the end of their own series before the characters were retired for good. For audiences, it was a chance to see all of the three landlord characters &ndash; played by Fell, Lindley, and Knotts &ndash; on the same stage.\n\nTambor appeared on ''Three's Company'' that same season playing a different character, a wealthy but unwelcome suitor of Chrissy's cousin Cindy (Season 5, Episode #13). Tambor also made other guest appearances on ''Three's Company,'' portraying different characters.\n\nThe show was ranked number two on ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's \"Top 10 Worst TV Spin-Offs\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1845866_1846026_1845969,00.html|title=The Ropers, 1979\u201380 \u2013 Top 10 Worst TV Spin-Offs|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|accessdate=2010-12-30|date=October 1, 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2002 ''[[TV Guide]]'' named ''The Ropers'' the 49th worst TV series of all time.<ref>{{cite book|title=TV Guide Book of Lists|url=https://archive.org/details/tvguidebookoflis0000unse|url-access=registration|year=2007|publisher=Running Press|isbn=0-7624-3007-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/tvguidebookoflis0000unse/page/181 181]}}</ref>\n\n== Proposed spinoff ==\nIn 1986, distributor D. L. Taffner revealed its plans for a spinoff of ''The Ropers'' called ''Three Apartments''. The spinoff would again star Fell and Lindley, this time as landlords of a three-unit apartment building. The show was offered as either a two-year, 44-episode package in syndication starting April 1987, or as a 52-episode package on NBC-owned station checkerboards beginning in September 1987. Guest stars would include [[John Ritter]], [[Joyce DeWitt]], [[Richard Kline]], and [[Don Knotts]] from ''Three's Company''; [[Robert Mandan]] from ''[[Three's a Crowd]]''; and [[Jm J. Bullock]] and [[Nancy Dussault]] from ''[[Too Close for Comfort]]''/''The Ted Knight Show''. ''Three Apartments'' was to replace ''The Ted Knight Show'', a fellow Taffner-distributed show that ended production after the death of show namesake [[Ted Knight]] in August 1986.<ref name=\"Another3ForTaffner\">{{cite magazine |issn=0007-2028 |work=[[Broadcasting (magazine)|Broadcasting]] |department=Programing |title=Another 'Three' for Taffner |url=http://americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1986/BC-1986-10-20.pdf |location=Washington |volume=111 |number=16 |publication-date=October 20, 1986 |page=46}}</ref> The spinoff was withdrawn in January 1987 because of a glut of syndicated sitcom offerings, a lack of time slots, and a difficult advertising market.<ref name=\"BuyersMart\">{{cite newspaper |issn=0011-5509 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |volume=326 |number=1 |pages=1, 59 |title=Buyer's mart for syndie shows |given=John |surname=Dempsey |location=New Orleans, Louisiana}}</ref>\n\n==Episodes==\n{| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=2| Season\n!

Two episodes of the series, however, play in the syndication package of ''Three's Company''. When initially offered in syndication, the series ran under the title '''''Three's Company's Friends, The Ropers'''''. That version used an instrumental version of the original series' theme song. Six episodes of the series were aired on [[TV Land]] in September 2006, and four episodes were aired on [[WGN America]] in October 2008.\n\nBeginning in January 2011 [[Antenna TV]], a television network designed for digital television subchannels and owned by [[Tribune Broadcasting]], aired the sitcom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.sitcomsonline.com/2010/12/our-exclusive-interview-with-antenna.html|title=Our Exclusive Interview with Antenna TV's Sean Compton; KTLA Preview of Antenna TV; 2011 SAG Nominations - SitcomsOnline.com News Blog|work=sitcomsonline.com}}</ref> The series started on Tuesday, February 15, 2011, and went through one entire rotation of all episodes before being removed from the lineup.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.sitcomsonline.com/2011/01/antenna-tv-premieres-ropers-on-feb-15.html|title=Antenna TV Premieres The Ropers on Feb. 15, 2011; Remembering Character Actor Peter Hobbs - SitcomsOnline.com News Blog|work=sitcomsonline.com}}</ref> On August 29, 2011, the show returned to the lineup as the ''Three's Company'' cycle again came to the point of the series where the Ropers left.\n\nAntenna TV usually shows back-to-back episodes of ''Three's Company''. But when the cycle comes to the point of the Ropers' departure, the network then airs ''The Ropers'' following a single episode of ''Three's Company'' until the end of the ''Ropers'' cycle, then resumes the back-to-back ''Three's Company'' airings.\n\nBeginning in 2015, Antenna TV began airing the series on weekends back to back with the other ''Three's Company'' spin-off series ''[[Three's A Crowd]]''.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0078679|title=The Ropers}}\n* [http://www.tv.com/shows/the-ropers/ The Ropers at TV.com]\n* [http://www.sitcomsonline.com/theropers.html Sitcoms Online: ''The Ropers'']\n\n{{Cooke and Mortimer}}\n{{Three's Company}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ropers, The}}\n[[Category:1970s American sitcoms]]\n[[Category:1979 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1980s American sitcoms]]\n[[Category:1980 American television series endings]]\n[[Category:American Broadcasting Company original programming]]\n[[Category:American television series based on British television series]]\n[[Category:American television spin-offs]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Television duos]]\n[[Category:Television series about marriage]]\n[[Category:Television shows set in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Three's Company]]\n", "name_user": "Moe1810", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eRecurring characters", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ropers"}

A Rosa King Foundation was established in the Netherlands to help young female artists, and a memorial concert was conducted at the [[Melkweg]] concert house in Amsterdam.\n\n==Discography==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n |-\n! scope=\"col\" | Album\n! scope=\"col\" | Tracks\n! scope=\"col\" | Tracks\n|-\n|\t''Rosa King & Upside Down''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Rosa-King-Rosa-King-And-Upside-Down/release/3898604|title=Rosa King - Rosa King And Upside Down|website=Discogs}}</ref>\n* 1974\n* Blue Elephant \u2013 PE 877072\n* Dureco*\n* Vinyl, LP \n*Netherlands\n|\n*1\tUp Side Down\n*2\tDon't Make Me Wait In Vain\n*3\tFeet Freak\n*4\tI Got To Feel Free\n*5\tGhetto Of Peoples Minds\n*6\tDo You Wanna\n|\n*7\tUnderstanding\n*8          Fame And Fortune \n*9\tBlues For You \n*10\tChicken Legs \n*11\tFoot Steps \n*12\tTroubles\n|-\n|\t''Vrouwenfestival 1979 - Live at the Melkweg''\n\n* 1979 Vrouwenfestival (women's festival)\n* with various female performers\n*Vinyl, LP\n*Milky Way Records\n*Netherlands\n*recorded live at the Melkweg, Amsterdam\n|\n* 1 So Far To Go\t6:32\n|\n*   \n|-\n|\t''So Far To Go''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Rosa-King-Upside-Down-So-Far-To-Go/master/731793|title=Rosa King & Upside Down (5) - So Far To Go|website=Discogs}}</ref>\n\n* So Far To Go (LP, Album)\tCaribbean Circle\tF.C. 30505\tNetherlands\t1980\t\n* Summertime (LP, Album)\t\u0411\u0430\u043b\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0442\u043e\u043d\t\u0412\u0422\u0410 2095\tBulgaria\t1979\t\n|\n*1 Change Is Gonna Come\t3:15\n*2 So Far To Go\t6:35\n*3 When Your Love Is Gone\t6:15\n*4 No Tears\t3:15\n|\n*5 Summer Time\t4:00\n*6 Do You Love Me Because\t3:30\n*7 Hello Lover\t3:10\n*8 All In The Name Of Love\t5:00\n|-\n|\t''Too Busy''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Rosa-King-Upside-Down-Too-Busy/release/2284906|title=Rosa King & Upside Down (5) - Too Busy|website=Discogs}}</ref>\n\n* 1980/1984\n*Pop Eye Label PE 105\n* Vinyl, LP, Mini-Album\n* Netherlands\n|\n*1\tToo Busy (Loving You)\t3:40\n*2\tCan't Go Through Life\t3:55\n*3\tI Never Knew\t4:02\n|\n*4\tYou've Changed Your Mind\t5:43\n*5\tSometimes\t4:28\n|-\n|\t''Rosa King's Favourite Blues Live''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Rosa-King-Rosa-Kings-Favourite-Blues/master/1052947|title=Rosa King - Rosa Kings Favourite Blues|website=Discogs}}</ref>\n\n* Live LP\n* 1981 Paradise + 1991 Riff \n*Rosa Kings Favourite Blues (LP, Album)\tParadise \tSMC 100.005 1981\t\n*The Rosa Kings Favorite Ballads (LP, Album)\tParadise \tSMC 100.005 1981\t\n*Rosa King's Favourite Blues (CD, Album, Liv)\tD&K\tCD 860037 1991\n*Netherlands\n|\n*1 Gotta Be Free\t4:30\n*2 So Many Nights And Days\t5:00\n*3 St. James Infirmary\t4:47\n*4 Please Send Me Someone To Love\t5:00\n|\n*5 Gonna Find A New Love\t4:20\n*6 Georgia On My Mind\t4:45\n*7 Going Down Slow\t12:15\n*8 Trouble In My Mind\t4:44\n|-\n|\t''Under The Cover''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Rosa-King-Up-Side-Down-Under-The-Cover/master/518687|title=Rosa King & Up Side Down* - Under The Cover|website=Discogs}}</ref>\n\n*1987\n* Under The Cover (LP)\tD&K\tD&K 87011\tNetherlands\t1987\t\n*Under The Cover (LP)\tAVC\tAVL-2006\tSpain\t1989\n|\n*1 Baby I Didn't Know\t4:05\n*2 Hello Lover\t3:37\n*3 The Every Best\t6:19\n*4 Who's Playing A Joke On Who\t4:06\n|\n*5 You're In Love\t6:07\n*6 It Wasn't Easy\t4:49\n*7 Test Of Time\t5:15\n*8 You Love Me To Much\t5:26\n|-\n|\t''Jazz out of Harlem''\n\n*LP 1986\n*EMI\n|\n*\n|\n*\n|-\n|\t\"Who's Playing A Joke On Who?\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Rosa-King-Upside-Down-Whos-Playing-A-Joke-On-Who/master/599805|title=Rosa King, Upside Down (5) - Who's Playing A Joke On Who|website=Discogs}}</ref>\n\n* Maxi single     1988 Metropole \n*1987\n*Who's Playing A Joke On Who (12\")\tMetropol Records\tMRP-109-MX\tSpain\t1988\t\n*Who's Playing A Joke On Who (7\")\tD&K\t787011\tNetherlands\t1987\t\n*Who's Playing A Joke On Who (7\", Promo)\tMetropol Records\tMRP- 109-S\tSpain\t1988\t\n|\n*1 Who's Playing A Joke On Who\t4:06\n|\n*2 You Love Me To Much\t5:26\n|-\n|\t''It Just Happened Live Cafe Alto''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Rosa-King-Upside-Down-It-Just-Happened/release/6309336|title=Rosa King & Upside Down (5) - It Just Happened|website=Discogs}}</ref>\n\n*1992\n*Riff \u2013 85009-2\n*CD, Album \n*Netherlands\n|\n*1\tWhy\t7:54\n*2\tIt Just Happened\t7:05\n*3\tGonna Find Me A New Love\t10:04\n*4\tOwn Decision\t4:33\n*5\tBig Mistake\t8:11\n|\n*6\tDon't Activate My Love Decease\t8:47\n*7\tTaking Me A Chance\t5:11\n*8\tCold Cold Feeling\t10:13\n*9\tDo You Feel Like Some Times\t6:47\n*10\tLonely Me\t6:58\n|-\n|\t''Salsa Carnaval Live''\n\n* \n|\n* \n|\n* \n|-\n|\t''Cheating on Me''\n\n* * CD        1992 Bloomdido Productions/\n\nlive recording in Le Duc des Lombards, Parijs on 23/24 June 1992\n\nwith guest the American guitarist Luther Allison\n|\n*1.

Howard]] seized a key [[pontoon bridge]] over the [[Chattahoochee River]], enabling Federal troops to continue their offensive to capture the important rail and supply center of Atlanta.\n\nUnion Maj. Gen. [[William T. Sherman]]'s army had steadily advanced towards Atlanta in the spring and summer of 1864, fighting a series of battles against the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate Army]] of [[Joseph E. Johnston]]. Sherman continually flanked the Confederate positions and slipped ever closer to his goal. Howard's [[IV Corps (ACW)|IV Corps]] pursued the retreating Confederates along the [[Western & Atlantic Railroad]], with General [[Thomas J. Wood]]'s division in the lead. They encountered very little resistance until the head of column reached [[Vinings, Georgia|Vining's Station]]. From that point, a road led to the east toward Atlanta, crossing the Chattahoochee River at [[Pace's Ferry]], where the Confederates had constructed a pontoon bridge over the deep and swift flowing river. Wood's skirmishers encountered a brigade of dismounted cavalry, which had its front covered by rail barricades along a ridge at right angles to the road, a quarter mile from the railroad station.

Howard]] seized a key [[pontoon bridge]] over the [[Chattahoochee River]], enabling Federal troops to continue their offensive to capture the important rail and supply center of Atlanta.\n\nUnion Maj. Gen. [[William T. Sherman]]'s army had steadily advanced towards Atlanta in the spring and summer of 1864, fighting a series of battles against the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate Army]] of [[Joseph E.

Howard's [[IV Corps (ACW)|IV Corps]] pursued the retreating Confederates along the [[Western & Atlantic Railroad]], with General [[Thomas J. Wood]]'s division in the lead. They encountered very little resistance until the head of column reached [[Vinings, Georgia|Vining's Station]]. From that point, a road led to the east toward Atlanta, crossing the Chattahoochee River at [[Pace's Ferry]], where the Confederates had constructed a pontoon bridge over the deep and swift flowing river. Wood's skirmishers encountered a brigade of dismounted cavalry, which had its front covered by rail barricades along a ridge at right angles to the road, a quarter mile from the railroad station. Wood quickly drove the Confederates from these barricades and pushed on to the river. Despite Confederate efforts to destroy the bridge to prevent it from falling into enemy hands, Wood's men arrived in time to save the greater part of the bridge.

King County's [[Port of Seattle]] was established as the first Port District in Washington State. The Port of Seattle is King County's only Port District. It is governed by five Port Commissioners, who are elected countywide and serve four-year terms. The Port of Seattle owns and operates many properties on behalf of King County's citizens, including [[Sea-Tac International Airport]]; many seaport facilities around [[Elliott Bay]], including its original property, publicly owned [[Fishermen's Terminal]], home to the North Pacific fishing fleet and the largest homeport for fishermen in the U.S. West Coast;{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} four [[container ship]] terminals; two [[cruise ship]] terminals; the largest grain export terminal in the U.S. Pacific Northwest; three public [[marina]]s; 22 public parks; and nearly 5,000 acres of industrial lands in the [[Ballard, Seattle, Washington|Ballard]]-[[Interbay (Seattle)|Interbay]] and [[Harbor Island (Seattle)|Lower Duwamish industrial center]]s.\n\n===Council members===\n{{Main|King County Council}}\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-3}}\n* District 1 \u2013 [[Rod Dembowski]]\n* District 2 \u2013 [[Girmay Zahilay]]\n* District 3 \u2013 [[Kathy Lambert]]\n{{Col-3}}\n* District 4 \u2013 [[Jeanne Kohl-Welles]]\n* District 5 \u2013 [[Dave Upthegrove]]\n* District 6 \u2013 [[Claudia Balducci]]\n{{Col-3}}\n* District 7 \u2013 [[Pete von Reichbauer]]\n* District 8 \u2013 [[Joe McDermott (politician)|Joe McDermott]]\n* District 9 \u2013 [[Reagan Dunn]]\n{{Col-end}}\n\n==Politics==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=November 2016}}\nKing County and Seattle are strongly associated with liberal politics; the area is a bastion for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. No Republican presidential candidate has garnered the majority of the county's votes since [[Ronald Reagan]]'s [[1984 United States presidential election|landslide reelection victory in 1984]]. In the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 election]], [[Barack Obama]] defeated [[John McCain]] in the county by 42 percentage points, a larger margin than any previous election. Slightly more than 29% of Washington state's population reside in King County, making it a significant factor for the Democrats in a few recent close statewide elections. In 2000, it was King County that pushed [[Maria Cantwell]]'s total over that of incumbent [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Slade Gorton]], winning her a seat in the [[United States Senate]]. In 2004, King County gave a lead to Democrat [[Christine Gregoire]] in the second recount in the state's [[Washington gubernatorial election, 2004|gubernatorial election]], pushing her ahead of Republican [[Dino Rossi]], who led by 261 votes after the initial count.<ref>{{cite news |date=November 18, 2004 |title=It's Rossi by 261; recount is next |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2002094147_gov18m.html |work=The Seattle Times |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060323034101/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2002094147_gov18m.html |archivedate=March 23, 2006 }}</ref> Rossi resided in the county at the time of the election, in [[Sammamish, Washington|Sammamish]].\n\nThe suburbs east and south of Seattle have historically tended to be moderate. In the 2005 County Executive race, Republican [[David Irons (politician)]] beat Democrat Ron Sims outside of Seattle (which voted 74% for Sims), but in 2004, [[John Kerry]] received landslide victories in much of the [[Bellevue, Washington|Bellevue]] and [[Redmond, Washington|Redmond]] areas. Generally the suburbs are becoming more liberal on the state and county levels.\n\nIn 2004, voters passed a referendum reducing the size of the County Council from 13 members to 9. This resulted in all council seats ending up on the 2005 ballot.\n\nSome residents of eastern King County have long desired to secede and form their own county.

In the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 election]], [[Barack Obama]] defeated [[John McCain]] in the county by 42 percentage points, a larger margin than any previous election. Slightly more than 29% of Washington state's population reside in King County, making it a significant factor for the Democrats in a few recent close statewide elections. In 2000, it was King County that pushed [[Maria Cantwell]]'s total over that of incumbent [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Slade Gorton]], winning her a seat in the [[United States Senate]]. In 2004, King County gave a lead to Democrat [[Christine Gregoire]] in the second recount in the state's [[Washington gubernatorial election, 2004|gubernatorial election]], pushing her ahead of Republican [[Dino Rossi]], who led by 261 votes after the initial count.<ref>{{cite news |date=November 18, 2004 |title=It's Rossi by 261; recount is next |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2002094147_gov18m.html |work=The Seattle Times |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060323034101/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2002094147_gov18m.html |archivedate=March 23, 2006 }}</ref> Rossi resided in the county at the time of the election, in [[Sammamish, Washington|Sammamish]].\n\nThe suburbs east and south of Seattle have historically tended to be moderate. In the 2005 County Executive race, Republican [[David Irons (politician)]] beat Democrat Ron Sims outside of Seattle (which voted 74% for Sims), but in 2004, [[John Kerry]] received landslide victories in much of the [[Bellevue, Washington|Bellevue]] and [[Redmond, Washington|Redmond]] areas. Generally the suburbs are becoming more liberal on the state and county levels.\n\nIn 2004, voters passed a referendum reducing the size of the County Council from 13 members to 9. This resulted in all council seats ending up on the 2005 ballot.\n\nSome residents of eastern King County have long desired to secede and form their own county.
