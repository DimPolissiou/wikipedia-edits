It was released in November 1975 as the lead single of his tenth studio album ''[[Station to Station]]'' (1976). It was the first track completed during the album's sessions, a period when Bowie's [[cocaine]] addiction was at its peak. At one stage it was slated to be the album's title track.\n\n==Composition and lyrics==\n\"Golden Years\" was the first track recorded for ''Station to Station'' in September 1975 at [[Cherokee Studios]] in Los Angeles.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|pp=236\u2013237}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=288}} Regarding the recording, co-producer [[Harry Maslin]] recalled that the song was \"cut and finished very fast.

It is also included on ''Re:Call 2'', part of the ''[[Who Can I Be Now? (1974\u20131976)]]'' compilation.\n* The song was included on the album ''[[Trainspotting (soundtrack)|Trainspotting #2: Music from the Motion Picture, Vol. #2]]'' (1997).\n* The song was included on the original soundtrack of ''[[A Knight's Tale (film)|A Knight's Tale]]'' (2001), starring [[Heath Ledger]]. The original film score was written for the film by Hollywood composer [[Carter Burwell]]. One scene in the movie is a formal dance, which calls for courtly music based on Burwell's love theme to segue into David Bowie's song \"Golden Years\". It presented several challenges. First, the whole dance had been choreographed and filmed to an arbitrary tempo which begins at a slow courtly pace and speeds up and up until Bowie's song kicks in. Burwell had to match that tempo and the choreography after the fact and also find some credible path from a formal and restrained dance to a joyful '70s pop tune. They obtained Bowie's permission to pull tracks from his multitrack master of the song so they could mix these into Burwell's arrangement, helping to introduce his song before it has really begun. The end result is not on either of the CDs which were released (song or score soundtrack). Tony Visconti, who produced the original recording of the song, supervised the remix session, and Bowie dropped by as well to hear what they found in his multitrack.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://carterburwell.com/projects/Knights_Tale.shtml |title=A Knight's Tale |publisher=Carter Burwell |date= |accessdate=2016-10-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100906192026/http://www.carterburwell.com/projects/Knights_Tale.shtml |archive-date=6 September 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Chart history==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n===Weekly charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1975\u201376)\n!Peak<br />position\n|-\n|Australia ([[Kent Music Report]])\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|34\n|-\n|Canada ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' Top Singles\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|17\n|-\n|{{singlechart|Ireland2|9|song=Golden Years|accessdate=September 23, 2018}}\n|-\n|Netherlands \n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|6\n|-\n|New Zealand (''[[New Zealand Listener|Listener]]'')<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.flavourofnz.co.nz/index.php?qpageID=search%20rianz&qartistid=759#n_view_location |title=Flavour of New Zealand, 9 April 1976 |access-date=23 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180923200644/http://www.flavourofnz.co.nz/index.php?qpageID=search%20rianz&qartistid=759#n_view_location |archive-date=23 September 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|18\n|-\n|Sweden \n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|10\n|-\n|[[UK Singles Chart]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Official Charts Company |url=http://Officialcharts.com |date= |accessdate=2018-07-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217061412/http://www.officialcharts.com/ |archive-date=17 February 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|8\n|-\n|US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]]<ref>''Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Singles 1955\u20131990'' \u2013 {{ISBN|0-89820-089-X}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|10\n|-\n|US [[Cash Box (magazine)|''Cash Box'']] Top 100<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://tropicalglen.com/Archives/70s_files/19760327.html |title=Cash Box Top 100 Singles, March 27, 1976 |access-date=23 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181020004019/http://tropicalglen.com/Archives/70s_files/19760327.html |archive-date=20 October 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|12\n|-\n|}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Year-end charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1976)\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Rank\n|-\n|Canada<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?file_num=nlc008388.5173b&brws_s=&type=1&interval=20&PHPSESSID=u9874ano8k0c5b6bkp4r8qrbp3 |title= Top Singles \u2013 Volume 26, No. 14 & 15, January 08 1977 |work= [[RPM (magazine)|RPM]] |publisher= [[Library and Archives Canada]] |accessdate= January 22, 2016 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160610094136/http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?file_num=nlc008388.5173b&brws_s=&type=1&interval=20&PHPSESSID=u9874ano8k0c5b6bkp4r8qrbp3 |archive-date= 10 June 2016 |url-status= dead }}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|144\n|-\n|US ''Billboard'' Hot 100<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.musicoutfitters.com/topsongs/1976.htm |title=Musicoutfitters.com |access-date=23 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181116082743/https://www.musicoutfitters.com/topsongs/1976.htm |archive-date=16 November 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|33\n|-\n|}\n{{col-end}}\n\n==David Bowie vs KCRW==\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = Golden Years David Bowie vs KCRW\n| cover      = DavidBowie-GoldenYearsKCRW.jpg\n| alt        =\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[David Bowie]]\n| album      =\n| released   = 2011\n| format     = [[CD single]]\n| recorded   =\n| studio     = \n| venue      =\n| genre      = \n| length     =\n| label      = [[Virgin Records|Virgin]]\n| writer     = \n| producer   = \n| prev_title = [[Rebel Never Gets Old]]\n| prev_year  = 2004\n| next_title = [[Where Are We Now?]]\n| next_year  = 2013\n}}\n\nAn updated single of \"Golden Years\" was released in 2011 to coincide with the re-release of ''Station to Station''.

The original film score was written for the film by Hollywood composer [[Carter Burwell]]. One scene in the movie is a formal dance, which calls for courtly music based on Burwell's love theme to segue into David Bowie's song \"Golden Years\". It presented several challenges. First, the whole dance had been choreographed and filmed to an arbitrary tempo which begins at a slow courtly pace and speeds up and up until Bowie's song kicks in. Burwell had to match that tempo and the choreography after the fact and also find some credible path from a formal and restrained dance to a joyful '70s pop tune. They obtained Bowie's permission to pull tracks from his multitrack master of the song so they could mix these into Burwell's arrangement, helping to introduce his song before it has really begun. The end result is not on either of the CDs which were released (song or score soundtrack). Tony Visconti, who produced the original recording of the song, supervised the remix session, and Bowie dropped by as well to hear what they found in his multitrack.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://carterburwell.com/projects/Knights_Tale.shtml |title=A Knight's Tale |publisher=Carter Burwell |date= |accessdate=2016-10-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100906192026/http://www.carterburwell.com/projects/Knights_Tale.shtml |archive-date=6 September 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Chart history==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n===Weekly charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1975\u201376)\n!Peak<br />position\n|-\n|Australia ([[Kent Music Report]])\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|34\n|-\n|Canada ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' Top Singles\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|17\n|-\n|{{singlechart|Ireland2|9|song=Golden Years|accessdate=September 23, 2018}}\n|-\n|Netherlands \n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|6\n|-\n|New Zealand (''[[New Zealand Listener|Listener]]'')<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.flavourofnz.co.nz/index.php?qpageID=search%20rianz&qartistid=759#n_view_location |title=Flavour of New Zealand, 9 April 1976 |access-date=23 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180923200644/http://www.flavourofnz.co.nz/index.php?qpageID=search%20rianz&qartistid=759#n_view_location |archive-date=23 September 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|18\n|-\n|Sweden \n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|10\n|-\n|[[UK Singles Chart]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Official Charts Company |url=http://Officialcharts.com |date= |accessdate=2018-07-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217061412/http://www.officialcharts.com/ |archive-date=17 February 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|8\n|-\n|US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]]<ref>''Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Singles 1955\u20131990'' \u2013 {{ISBN|0-89820-089-X}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|10\n|-\n|US [[Cash Box (magazine)|''Cash Box'']] Top 100<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://tropicalglen.com/Archives/70s_files/19760327.html |title=Cash Box Top 100 Singles, March 27, 1976 |access-date=23 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181020004019/http://tropicalglen.com/Archives/70s_files/19760327.html |archive-date=20 October 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|12\n|-\n|}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Year-end charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1976)\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Rank\n|-\n|Canada<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?file_num=nlc008388.5173b&brws_s=&type=1&interval=20&PHPSESSID=u9874ano8k0c5b6bkp4r8qrbp3 |title= Top Singles \u2013 Volume 26, No. 14 & 15, January 08 1977 |work= [[RPM (magazine)|RPM]] |publisher= [[Library and Archives Canada]] |accessdate= January 22, 2016 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160610094136/http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?file_num=nlc008388.5173b&brws_s=&type=1&interval=20&PHPSESSID=u9874ano8k0c5b6bkp4r8qrbp3 |archive-date= 10 June 2016 |url-status= dead }}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|144\n|-\n|US ''Billboard'' Hot 100<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.musicoutfitters.com/topsongs/1976.htm |title=Musicoutfitters.com |access-date=23 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181116082743/https://www.musicoutfitters.com/topsongs/1976.htm |archive-date=16 November 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|33\n|-\n|}\n{{col-end}}\n\n==David Bowie vs KCRW==\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = Golden Years David Bowie vs KCRW\n| cover      = DavidBowie-GoldenYearsKCRW.jpg\n| alt        =\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[David Bowie]]\n| album      =\n| released   = 2011\n| format     = [[CD single]]\n| recorded   =\n| studio     = \n| venue      =\n| genre      = \n| length     =\n| label      = [[Virgin Records|Virgin]]\n| writer     = \n| producer   = \n| prev_title = [[Rebel Never Gets Old]]\n| prev_year  = 2004\n| next_title = [[Where Are We Now?]]\n| next_year  = 2013\n}}\n\nAn updated single of \"Golden Years\" was released in 2011 to coincide with the re-release of ''Station to Station''.

They called the location ''Yenecam\u00fa''.\n\nAccording to the narrative of Hatsutaro, a Japanese castaway, in the book ''[[Kaigai Ibun]]'' (written by Maekawa, Junzo and Bunzo Sakai and narrated by Hatsutaro), when he arrived at Cabo San Lucas in May 1842, there were only two houses and about 20 inhabitants. However, American authors such as Henry Edwards and [[John Ross Browne]] claim that Cabo San Lucas's founder was an Englishman named Thomas \"Old Tom\" Ritchie. John Ross Browne says Ritchie arrived there about 1828, while Edwards says that he died in October 1874.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/67479461|title=Thomas Ritchie (1810 - 1874) - Find A Grave Memorial|publisher=}}</ref>\nThe actual founder of Cabo San Lucas was Cipriano Cese\u00f1a in 1788 who arrived from Hermosillo, Sonora.

In 1917, an [[United States|American]] company built a floating platform to catch [[tuna]], and ten years later founded Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Productos Marinos S.A. The plant operated for several years.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\n==Tourism==\n[[File:Cabo San Lucas Los Arcos 3.jpg|thumb|El Arco de Cabo San Lucas]]\nCabo San Lucas has become a prominent vacation and spa destination, with a variety of sites of interest and timeshares that have been built on the coast between San Lucas and [[San Jos\u00e9 del Cabo]]. The distinctive [[El Arco de Cabo San Lucas|Arco de Cabo San Lucas]] is a local landmark.\n\n'''Cabo San Lucas''' has the highest paying [[big-game fishing|marlin tournament]] in the world called the \"Bisbee's Los Cabos Offshore\".

The development of Cabo's tourism industry was prompted by the [[Federal government of Mexico|Mexican government]]'s development of [[infrastructure]] to turn Cabo San Lucas into a major center for tourism in '''Mexico''', beginning in 1974. Upon completion of the Transpeninsular Highway, also known as the [[Mexican Federal Highway 1]], tourist developments in [[Los Cabos]] proceeded relatively unchecked.\n\nUntil fairly recently,{{When|date=March 2012}} the unique and fragile environment of this part of Mexico was largely unprotected by law, and therefore was subjected to developers acting in concert with government agencies interested only in low-end tourist bonanzas. There is, however, a growing collection of activists and attorneys now involved in preserving many of Baja's desert habitats, marine mammals, and stretches of coastline.

As of 2015, the population of the city was 81,111 inhabitants.<ref name=\"saludbcs.gob.mx\"/> Cabo San Lucas together with [[San Jos\u00e9 del Cabo]] is known as [[Los Cabos]].

The [[Los Cabos Corridor]] has become a heavily trafficked [[Tourism|vacation]] destination for tourists, with numerous [[resort]]s and [[timeshare]]s along the coast between Cabo San Lucas and San Jos\u00e9 del Cabo.\n\nThe waters around Cabo are home to marine wildlife including rays, sharks, [[mahi-mahi]] (dorado) and striped marlin.\n\n==History==\n[[File:CaboSanLucasMarina2004.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Cabo San Lucas Marina in 2004]]\nArchaeological excavations have shown evidence of continual human habitation in the area for at least 10,000 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.innerexplorations.com/bajatext/an.htm|title=An Interview with Harumi Fujita on the Archaeology of Baja California Sur|publisher=}}</ref> When the first [[Europe]]ans arrived, they encountered the [[Peric\u00fa]] people, who survived on a subsistence diet based on hunting and gathering [[seed]]s, [[root]]s, [[shellfish]], and other marine resources. They called the location ''Yenecam\u00fa''.\n\nAccording to the narrative of Hatsutaro, a Japanese castaway, in the book ''[[Kaigai Ibun]]'' (written by Maekawa, Junzo and Bunzo Sakai and narrated by Hatsutaro), when he arrived at Cabo San Lucas in May 1842, there were only two houses and about 20 inhabitants. However, American authors such as Henry Edwards and [[John Ross Browne]] claim that Cabo San Lucas's founder was an Englishman named Thomas \"Old Tom\" Ritchie. John Ross Browne says Ritchie arrived there about 1828, while Edwards says that he died in October 1874.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/67479461|title=Thomas Ritchie (1810 - 1874) - Find A Grave Memorial|publisher=}}</ref>\nThe actual founder of Cabo San Lucas was Cipriano Cese\u00f1a in 1788 who arrived from Hermosillo, Sonora. Per The book by Pablo L. Martinez, Guia Familiar de Baja California 1700-1900. \n\nA fishing village began growing in the area. In 1917, an [[United States|American]] company built a floating platform to catch [[tuna]], and ten years later founded Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Productos Marinos S.A. The plant operated for several years.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\n==Tourism==\n[[File:Cabo San Lucas Los Arcos 3.jpg|thumb|El Arco de Cabo San Lucas]]\nCabo San Lucas has become a prominent vacation and spa destination, with a variety of sites of interest and timeshares that have been built on the coast between San Lucas and [[San Jos\u00e9 del Cabo]]. The distinctive [[El Arco de Cabo San Lucas|Arco de Cabo San Lucas]] is a local landmark.\n\n'''Cabo San Lucas''' has the highest paying [[big-game fishing|marlin tournament]] in the world called the \"Bisbee's Los Cabos Offshore\". This tournament takes place every year in the month of October.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bisbees.com/|title=Home Page - Bisbees.com|last=Inc.|first=DAGTech Solutions|website=www.bisbees.com|access-date=2017-08-07}}</ref>\n\nIn the winter, pods of whales can be observed in the area. They bear their calves in the warm waters of the [[Gulf of California]] after completing their 6000-mile migration from [[Alaska]] and [[Siberia]].\n\n===Development===\n[[File:Marina_en_Cabo_San_Lucas.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Mall in Cabo San Lucas]]\n\nThe beaches, surfing, and [[sport fishing]] opportunities in Cabo San Lucas have attracted a great number of Mexican natives and foreigners to spend their vacations in large-scale tourist developments there. The development of Cabo's tourism industry was prompted by the [[Federal government of Mexico|Mexican government]]'s development of [[infrastructure]] to turn Cabo San Lucas into a major center for tourism in '''Mexico''', beginning in 1974. Upon completion of the Transpeninsular Highway, also known as the [[Mexican Federal Highway 1]], tourist developments in [[Los Cabos]] proceeded relatively unchecked.\n\nUntil fairly recently,{{When|date=March 2012}} the unique and fragile environment of this part of Mexico was largely unprotected by law, and therefore was subjected to developers acting in concert with government agencies interested only in low-end tourist bonanzas. There is, however, a growing collection of activists and attorneys now involved in preserving many of Baja's desert habitats, marine mammals, and stretches of coastline. A number of agencies including the Gulf of California Conservation Fund<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conservation.org/sites/gcf/fmg/articles/Pages/sept_07_bahia_fund.aspx|title=Error|website=www.conservation.org|access-date=2011-01-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928081619/http://www.conservation.org/sites/gcf/fmg/articles/Pages/sept_07_bahia_fund.aspx|archive-date=2011-09-28|url-status=dead}}</ref> and the Center for Environmental Law in [[La Paz, Baja California Sur|La Paz]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icf-xchange.org/graphics/plug?p=campaign_display_1&w=cemda|title=The Center for Environmental Law in La Paz|publisher=|access-date=2011-01-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314010336/http://www.icf-xchange.org/graphics/plug?p=campaign_display_1&w=cemda|archive-date=2011-03-14|url-status=dead}}</ref> are challenging the destruction of wetlands and other ecosystems from Los Cabos to [[Ensenada, Baja California|Ensenada]].

He had flown 90 operational flying hours and 19 sorties, and had also been awarded posthumously the [[Distinguished Flying Medal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/36215/supplements/4620|title=Supplement to the London Gazette|date=19 October 1943|website=London-gazette.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and wartime service==\nAaron was a native of [[Leeds]], Yorkshire, and was educated at [[Roundhay School]] and Leeds School of Architecture.  When the Second World War started in 1939 Aaron joined the [[Air Training Corps]] squadron at Leeds University. The following year he volunteered to train as aircrew in the Royal Air Force.  He trained as a pilot in the United States at [[British Flying Training School Program|No. 1 British Flying Training School (BFTS)]] at [[Terrell Municipal Airport]] in [[Terrell, Texas]]. Aaron completed his pilot training on 15 September 1941 and returned to England to train at an Operation Conversion Unit before he joined [[No. 218 Squadron RAF|No. 218 \"Gold Coast\" Squadron]], flying [[Short Stirling]] heavy bombers from [[RAF Downham Market]]. \n\nHis first operational sortie was a mining sortie in the Bay of Biscay but he was soon flying missions over Germany. On one sortie his Stirling was badly damaged but he completed his bombing run and returned to England, his actions were rewarded with a [[Distinguished Flying Medal]].\n\n==VC action==\nAaron was 21 years old, flying Stirling serial number EF452 on his 20th sortie. Nearing the target, his bomber was struck by machine gun fire. The bomber's Canadian navigator, Cornelius A. Brennan, was killed and other members of the crew were wounded.\n\nThe official citation for his VC reads:\n\n{{quote|''Air Ministry, 5th November, 1943.''\nThe [[George VI|King]] has been graciously pleased to confer the Victoria Cross on the undermentioned airman in recognition of most conspicuous bravery:\u2014\n\n458181 Acting [[Flight Sergeant]] Arthur Louis Aaron, D.F.M., [[Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve]], No. 218 Squadron (deceased).\n\nOn the night of 12 August 1943, Flight Sergeant Aaron was captain and pilot of a Stirling aircraft detailed to attack [[Turin]]. When approaching to attack, the bomber received devastating bursts of fire from an enemy fighter. Three engines were hit, the windscreen shattered, the front and rear [[Gun turret#Aircraft|turrets]] put out of action and the [[Elevator (aircraft)|elevator control]] damaged, causing the aircraft to become unstable and difficult to control. The navigator was killed and other members of the crew were wounded.\n\nA bullet struck Flight Sergeant Aaron in the face, breaking his jaw and tearing away part of his face. He was also wounded in the lung and his right arm was rendered useless. As he fell forward over the control column, the aircraft dived several thousand feet. Control was regained by the flight engineer at 3,000 feet. Unable to speak, Flight Sergeant Aaron urged the bomb aimer by signs to take over the controls. Course was then set southwards in an endeavour to fly the crippled bomber, with one engine out of action, to [[Sicily]] or [[North Africa]].\n\nFlight Sergeant Aaron was assisted to the rear of the aircraft and treated with [[morphia]]. After resting for some time he rallied and, mindful of his responsibility as captain of aircraft, insisted on returning to the pilot's cockpit, where he was lifted into his seat and had his feet placed on the rudder bar. Twice he made determined attempts to take control and hold the aircraft to its course but his weakness was evident and with difficulty he was persuaded to desist. Though in great pain and suffering from exhaustion, he continued to help by writing directions with his left hand.\n\nFive hours after leaving the target the petrol began to run low, but soon afterwards the flare path at [[Rabah Bitat Airport|Bone airfield]] was sighted. Flight Sergeant Aaron summoned his failing strength to direct the bomb aimer in the hazardous task of landing the damaged aircraft in the darkness with undercarriage retracted. Four attempts were made under his direction; at the fifth Flight Sergeant Aaron was so near to collapsing that he had to be restrained by the crew and the landing was completed by the bomb aimer.\n\nNine hours after landing, Flight Sergeant Aaron died from exhaustion. Had he been content, when grievously wounded, to lie still and conserve his failing strength, he would probably have recovered, but he saw it as his duty to exert himself to the utmost, if necessary with his last breath, to ensure that his aircraft and crew did not fall into enemy hands. In appalling conditions he showed the greatest qualities of courage, determination and leadership and, though wounded and dying, he set an example of devotion to duty which has seldom been equalled and never surpassed.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=36235 |supp=y |page=4859 |date=5 November 1943}}</ref>}}\n\nThe gunfire that hit Flight Sergeant Aaron's aircraft was thought to have been from an enemy night fighter, but may have been [[friendly fire]] from another Stirling.<ref>''The Stirling Bomber'', Bowyer, 1980, page 129</ref>\n\n==Memorials==\n[[File:Arthur Aaron by Ibbeson1.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Graham Ibbeson]]'s statue of Aaron in Leeds]]\nHe was an 'old boy' of [[Roundhay School]], Leeds (headmaster at the time was B.A.Farrow). There is a plaque in the main hall of the school to his memory incorporating the deed that merited the VC. \n\nGenealogical research proved many years ago that Aaron's father was a Russian Jewish immigrant even though the family denied it after Aaron was killed, and he boasted of this to members of his air training colleagues in the mess in Texas on many occasions.<ref>\"We Will Remember Them\" by Henry Morris and Martin Sugarman, published by Valentine Mitchell, 2011</ref> \n\n''{Genealogical research carried out in 2018 - 2019 proved that Arthur Louis Aaron was baptised a Roman Catholic on 15th October 1922 at St. Mary's Church, Knaresborough, North Yorkshire. The Baptism Record is held in the archives of Ampleforth Abbey Trust.  His father Benjamin Aaron was born on 29th June 1891 at 29 Dewsbury Road, Hunslet, Leeds, West Yorkshire. Benjamin Aaron was baptised on 2nd August 1891 at St Mary the Virgin, Hunslet Parish Church, Leeds. Arthur Louis Aaron's ancestry as proven by birth, baptism, marriage and death records and census records and other published period documentation can be traced by direct line back to William Aaron (b c1802 - died 27 Sept. 1877) and Faith Harrison ( b 27 Aug. 1796 - died 1 June 1866) who lived in Sherburn in Elmet, Yorkshire. Extensive documentary evidence corroborates what Arthur's father stated when he denied that the family were Jewish or of Russian immigrant origin but were in fact a long established Yorkshire family.  Arthur's father gave his religion as Church of England on his Army records. Arthur's parents, Benjamin Aaron and Rosalie Marie Marney were married on 8th February 1919 at Addingham Parish Church, near Ilkley,Yorkshire. However the power of the media cannot be underestimated and on 5th November 1943 when the announcement of the awarding of the Victoria Cross was published one newspaper, the Evening Despatch (published in Birmingham) above their report wrote the headline - \"Dying Jewish Flier Got Home Plane: Wins VC\". However on the same day the Liverpool Echo in their report wrote: \"Aaron was a Roman Catholic\". Another newspaper the Liverpool Evening Press referred to Arthur as \" a 21 year old Leeds Roman Catholic\". The Yorkshire Evening Post also on 5th November 1943 wrote in their piece about Arthur that : \"His father was a soldier in the last war. His mother is of Swiss extraction. Arthur was brought up as a Roman Catholic.\" On November 20th 1943 the Yorkshire Evening Post  reported on the Requiem Mass held for Arthur Louis Aaron at St Anne's Roman Catholic Cathedral in the centre of Leeds. There is no documentary evidence to support the contention that Arthur Louis Aaron was Jewish or that he was descended from a Russian immigrant family, despite claims to the contrary published elsewhere and which appear to be based on unsubstantiated hearsay.}''\n\nHe is commemorated at the AJEX [[Jewish Military Museum]] in Hendon, London, one of three Jewish Victoria Cross recipients of the Second World War (the others being [[Thomas William Gould|Tommy Gould]], Royal Navy, and [[John Patrick Kenneally|John Keneally]], Irish Guards). Aaron also belonged at school or University to 319 ATC (Jewish) Squadron in Broughton, Salford, where his photograph still hangs; this fact was researched by Col Martin Newman DL from the HQ Air Cadets archives. Aaron's Victoria Cross is displayed at the [[Leeds City Museum]].\n\nTo mark the new [[Millennium]], the Leeds Civic Trust organised a public vote to choose a statue to mark the occasion, and to publicise the city's past heroes and heroines.

He had flown 90 operational flying hours and 19 sorties, and had also been awarded posthumously the [[Distinguished Flying Medal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/36215/supplements/4620|title=Supplement to the London Gazette|date=19 October 1943|website=London-gazette.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and wartime service==\nAaron was a native of [[Leeds]], Yorkshire, and was educated at [[Roundhay School]] and Leeds School of Architecture.  When the Second World War started in 1939 Aaron joined the [[Air Training Corps]] squadron at Leeds University. The following year he volunteered to train as aircrew in the Royal Air Force.  He trained as a pilot in the United States at [[British Flying Training School Program|No. 1 British Flying Training School (BFTS)]] at [[Terrell Municipal Airport]] in [[Terrell, Texas]]. Aaron completed his pilot training on 15 September 1941 and returned to England to train at an Operation Conversion Unit before he joined [[No. 218 Squadron RAF|No. 218 \"Gold Coast\" Squadron]], flying [[Short Stirling]] heavy bombers from [[RAF Downham Market]]. \n\nHis first operational sortie was a mining sortie in the Bay of Biscay but he was soon flying missions over Germany. On one sortie his Stirling was badly damaged but he completed his bombing run and returned to England, his actions were rewarded with a [[Distinguished Flying Medal]].\n\n==VC action==\nAaron was 21 years old, flying Stirling serial number EF452 on his 20th sortie. Nearing the target, his bomber was struck by machine gun fire. The bomber's Canadian navigator, Cornelius A. Brennan, was killed and other members of the crew were wounded.\n\nThe official citation for his VC reads:\n\n{{quote|''Air Ministry, 5th November, 1943.''\nThe [[George VI|King]] has been graciously pleased to confer the Victoria Cross on the undermentioned airman in recognition of most conspicuous bravery:\u2014\n\n458181 Acting [[Flight Sergeant]] Arthur Louis Aaron, D.F.M., [[Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve]], No. 218 Squadron (deceased).\n\nOn the night of 12 August 1943, Flight Sergeant Aaron was captain and pilot of a Stirling aircraft detailed to attack [[Turin]]. When approaching to attack, the bomber received devastating bursts of fire from an enemy fighter. Three engines were hit, the windscreen shattered, the front and rear [[Gun turret#Aircraft|turrets]] put out of action and the [[Elevator (aircraft)|elevator control]] damaged, causing the aircraft to become unstable and difficult to control. The navigator was killed and other members of the crew were wounded.\n\nA bullet struck Flight Sergeant Aaron in the face, breaking his jaw and tearing away part of his face. He was also wounded in the lung and his right arm was rendered useless. As he fell forward over the control column, the aircraft dived several thousand feet. Control was regained by the flight engineer at 3,000 feet. Unable to speak, Flight Sergeant Aaron urged the bomb aimer by signs to take over the controls. Course was then set southwards in an endeavour to fly the crippled bomber, with one engine out of action, to [[Sicily]] or [[North Africa]].\n\nFlight Sergeant Aaron was assisted to the rear of the aircraft and treated with [[morphia]]. After resting for some time he rallied and, mindful of his responsibility as captain of aircraft, insisted on returning to the pilot's cockpit, where he was lifted into his seat and had his feet placed on the rudder bar. Twice he made determined attempts to take control and hold the aircraft to its course but his weakness was evident and with difficulty he was persuaded to desist. Though in great pain and suffering from exhaustion, he continued to help by writing directions with his left hand.\n\nFive hours after leaving the target the petrol began to run low, but soon afterwards the flare path at [[Rabah Bitat Airport|Bone airfield]] was sighted. Flight Sergeant Aaron summoned his failing strength to direct the bomb aimer in the hazardous task of landing the damaged aircraft in the darkness with undercarriage retracted. Four attempts were made under his direction; at the fifth Flight Sergeant Aaron was so near to collapsing that he had to be restrained by the crew and the landing was completed by the bomb aimer.\n\nNine hours after landing, Flight Sergeant Aaron died from exhaustion. Had he been content, when grievously wounded, to lie still and conserve his failing strength, he would probably have recovered, but he saw it as his duty to exert himself to the utmost, if necessary with his last breath, to ensure that his aircraft and crew did not fall into enemy hands. In appalling conditions he showed the greatest qualities of courage, determination and leadership and, though wounded and dying, he set an example of devotion to duty which has seldom been equalled and never surpassed.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=36235 |supp=y |page=4859 |date=5 November 1943}}</ref>}}\n\nThe gunfire that hit Flight Sergeant Aaron's aircraft was thought to have been from an enemy night fighter, but may have been [[friendly fire]] from another Stirling.<ref>''The Stirling Bomber'', Bowyer, 1980, page 129</ref>\n\n==Memorials==\n[[File:Arthur Aaron by Ibbeson1.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Graham Ibbeson]]'s statue of Aaron in Leeds]]\nHe was an 'old boy' of [[Roundhay School]], Leeds (headmaster at the time was B.A.Farrow). There is a plaque in the main hall of the school to his memory incorporating the deed that merited the VC. \n\nGenealogical research proved many years ago that Aaron's father was a Russian Jewish immigrant even though the family denied it after Aaron was killed, and he boasted of this to members of his air training colleagues in the mess in Texas on many occasions.<ref>\"We Will Remember Them\" by Henry Morris and Martin Sugarman, published by Valentine Mitchell, 2011</ref> \n\n''{Genealogical research carried out in 2018 - 2019 proved that Arthur Louis Aaron was baptised a Roman Catholic on 15th October 1922 at St. Mary's Church, Knaresborough, North Yorkshire. The Baptism Record is held in the archives of Ampleforth Abbey Trust.  His father Benjamin Aaron was born on 29th June 1891 at 29 Dewsbury Road, Hunslet, Leeds, West Yorkshire. Benjamin Aaron was baptised on 2nd August 1891 at St Mary the Virgin, Hunslet Parish Church, Leeds. Arthur Louis Aaron's ancestry as proven by birth, baptism, marriage and death records and census records and other published period documentation can be traced by direct line back to William Aaron (b c1802 - died 27 Sept. 1877) and Faith Harrison ( b 27 Aug. 1796 - died 1 June 1866) who lived in Sherburn in Elmet, Yorkshire. Extensive documentary evidence corroborates what Arthur's father stated when he denied that the family were Jewish or of Russian immigrant origin but were in fact a long established Yorkshire family.  Arthur's father gave his religion as Church of England on his Army records. Arthur's parents, Benjamin Aaron and Rosalie Marie Marney were married on 8th February 1919 at Addingham Parish Church, near Ilkley,Yorkshire. However the power of the media cannot be underestimated and on 5th November 1943 when the announcement of the awarding of the Victoria Cross was published one newspaper, the Evening Despatch (published in Birmingham) above their report wrote the headline - \"Dying Jewish Flier Got Home Plane: Wins VC\". However on the same day the Liverpool Echo in their report wrote: \"Aaron was a Roman Catholic\". Another newspaper the Liverpool Evening Press referred to Arthur as \" a 21 year old Leeds Roman Catholic\". The Yorkshire Evening Post also on 5th November 1943 wrote in their piece about Arthur that : \"His father was a soldier in the last war. His mother is of Swiss extraction. Arthur was brought up as a Roman Catholic.\" On November 20th 1943 the Yorkshire Evening Post  reported on the Requiem Mass held for Arthur Louis Aaron at St Anne's Roman Catholic Cathedral in the centre of Leeds.
