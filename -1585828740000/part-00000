He founded numerous orders under various names during the 1970s and 1980s. These were at first based on [[Pseudo-|pseudo]]-[[Islam]]ic themes and Judaism (Nubian Islamic Hebrews). Later he developed a theme derived from \"[[ancient Egypt in Afrocentrism|Ancient Egypt]],\" mixing ideas taken from [[black nationalism]], [[cryptozoology|cryptozoological]] and [[UFO religions]], and popular [[conspiracy theory]]. He last called his group the United Nuwaubian Nation of Moors, or Nuwabians.\n\nYork and the Nuwaubians came under scrutiny in the early 1990s, after they built ''[[Tama-Re]],'' an Egyptian-themed \"city\" for about a hundred of his followers, in rural [[Putnam County, Georgia]]. Before York's trial, the community had been joined directly and in the area by hundreds of other followers from out of state, while alienating both black and white local residents. The community was intensively investigated after numerous reports that York had molested numerous children of his followers.\n\nYork was arrested in May 2002. In 2004 he was convicted on federal charges of transporting minors across state lines for the purposes of sexual molestation, as well as racketeering and financial reporting violations.

Photograph by Kenneth C. Budd.]]\n\nYork left Brooklyn with an estimated 300 followers about 1990. Some settled in upstate New York. He later moved with numerous followers to [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Others joined them from such cities as Baltimore, Philadelphia, Hartford, New York and Washington, D.C.<ref name=\"moser\"/> According to former follower Robert J. Rohan, who later wrote a book about the movement, York moved in order to avoid criminal investigations and other charges in New York.<ref name=\"crawford\">[http://www.newagefraud.org/smf/index.php?topic=433.0 Sharon E. Crawford, \"Former Nuwaubian writes book, tells how York duped followers,\" ''The Macon Telegraph,'' 14 March 2005], posted at New Age Fraud website; accessed May 26, 2016</ref>\n\nPerhaps to avoid scrutiny from the international [[Muslim]] community, the Nation of Islam, the Nation of Gods and Earths, legal troubles, and the negative history of his group during their New York period, he changed his own name several times, as well as the group's name, and masked different parts of their doctrine.<ref name=\"watchman.org\"/> In Georgia, they changed their name to the \"United Nuwaubian Nation of Moors.\"<ref name=\"enc\"/>\n\nAt York's direction, the community purchased land and built ''[[Tama-Re]]'' (originally named Kadesh), an Egyptian-themed complex built on {{convert|476|acre|km2}} of land near [[Eatonton, Georgia]]. It was built over a period of years and completed in 1993.\n\nTensions with county authorities increased in 1998, when the county sought an injunction against construction and uses that violated zoning. At the same time, the Nuwaubian community increased its leafletting of Eatonton and surrounding areas, charging white officials with racial discrimination and striving to increase opposition to them. Threats mounted and an eviscerated dog carcass was left at the home of the county attorney.<ref name=\"moser\"/>\n\nWithin Putnam County, the Nuwaubians lost black support, in part by trying to take over the NAACP chapter. But outside, they appealed to activists, claiming to be persecuted in the county. During this period, the group maintained Holy Tabernacle stores \"in more than a dozen cities in the U.S., the United Kingdom and Trinidad.\"<ref name=\"moser\"/>  And York purchased a $557,000 mansion in [[Athens, Georgia]], about 60 miles away, the base of the University of Georgia.<ref name=\"moser\"/>\n\nIn July 1999, ''[[Time magazine]]'' reported on the \"40-ft. pyramids, obelisks, gods, goddesses and a giant sphinx,\" built by York's followers in rural Georgia in an article titled \"Space Invaders\".<ref>[http://www.culteducation.com/reference/nuwaubians/nuwaubians176.html Joe Kovac Jr., \"New Book Asks Provocative Questions About Dwight York\"], ''The Macon Telegraph,'' May 20, 2007, accessed May 25, 2016</ref>\n\nIn 2005 federal government officials acquired the property of Tama-Re through [[asset forfeiture]] after York was convicted and sentenced to prison for 135 years. He owed money for violating financial laws. After the property was sold, new owners demolished the buildings and monuments.\n\n=== Arrest and conviction of child molestation (2002\u2013present)===\nBeginning in Brooklyn, York had established strict sexual practices within the community, reserving for himself sexual access to many women and girls, including wives and children of followers.\n\nTheodore Gabriel wrote about these practices:\n\n<blockquote>[W]hile extolling the virtues and importance of family life and the conjugal relationship, he [York] denies such relationships to his followers except at strictly controlled intervals. He urges his female followers to pattern themselves on the Islamic paradigms of the wife and the mother, apparently desiring the creation of stable family units. But in reality the husbands and wives are [[sex segregation|segregated]] in dormitories, separated also from their children. York permits spouses to cohabit only once every three months. They are permitted to meet in the \"Green Room\" by prior appointment only.<ref>Gabriel, Theodore. \"Dwight York \u2013 a religious and cultural ''bricoleur'',\" in Partridge, C. ''UFO Religions,'' Routledge, 2003, p. 152</ref></blockquote>\n\nAnonymous letters were sent to Putnam County officials alleging child molestation at the Nuwaubian community. The FBI, which had started investigating the group in 1993, assigned a major task force to it. In 2002 York was arrested and charged with more than 100 counts of sexually molesting dozens of children, some as young as four years old. According to Bill Osinski, who wrote a 2007 book about York and the case:\n\n<blockquote>When he [York] was finally indicted, state prosecutors literally had to cut back the number of counts listed \u2014 from well beyond a thousand to slightly more than 200 \u2014 because they feared a jury simply wouldn't believe the magnitude of York's [[evil]].\u2026 [It] is believed to be the nation's largest child molestation prosecution ever directed at a single person, in terms of number of victims and number of alleged criminal acts.<ref>[http://www.ungodlybook.com/factsheet.htm Osinski, Bill.

He was convicted by a jury on January 23, 2004. The judge rejected his plea to be returned for trial to his own \"tribe,\" after York claimed status as an [[indigenous people|indigenous person]]:\n\n<blockquote>Your Honor, with all due respects to your government, your nation, and your court, we the indigenous people of this land have our own rights, accepted sovereign, our own governments.

(Comet Bennett, which was visible on that date, is said to have really been York\u2019s spacecraft.)

In 1967 he was preaching to the \"[[Afrocentric views on race|Ansaaru Allah]]\" ([[viz.]] African Americans) in [[Brooklyn]], New York, during the period of the [[Black Power]] movement. He founded numerous orders under various names during the 1970s and 1980s. These were at first based on [[Pseudo-|pseudo]]-[[Islam]]ic themes and Judaism (Nubian Islamic Hebrews). Later he developed a theme derived from \"[[ancient Egypt in Afrocentrism|Ancient Egypt]],\" mixing ideas taken from [[black nationalism]], [[cryptozoology|cryptozoological]] and [[UFO religions]], and popular [[conspiracy theory]].

Before York's trial, the community had been joined directly and in the area by hundreds of other followers from out of state, while alienating both black and white local residents. The community was intensively investigated after numerous reports that York had molested numerous children of his followers.\n\nYork was arrested in May 2002.

It was built over a period of years and completed in 1993.\n\nTensions with county authorities increased in 1998, when the county sought an injunction against construction and uses that violated zoning. At the same time, the Nuwaubian community increased its leafletting of Eatonton and surrounding areas, charging white officials with racial discrimination and striving to increase opposition to them. Threats mounted and an eviscerated dog carcass was left at the home of the county attorney.<ref name=\"moser\"/>\n\nWithin Putnam County, the Nuwaubians lost black support, in part by trying to take over the NAACP chapter.

He urges his female followers to pattern themselves on the Islamic paradigms of the wife and the mother, apparently desiring the creation of stable family units. But in reality the husbands and wives are [[sex segregation|segregated]] in dormitories, separated also from their children. York permits spouses to cohabit only once every three months.

The FBI, which had started investigating the group in 1993, assigned a major task force to it. In 2002 York was arrested and charged with more than 100 counts of sexually molesting dozens of children, some as young as four years old. According to Bill Osinski, who wrote a 2007 book about York and the case:\n\n<blockquote>When he [York] was finally indicted, state prosecutors literally had to cut back the number of counts listed \u2014 from well beyond a thousand to slightly more than 200 \u2014 because they feared a jury simply wouldn't believe the magnitude of York's [[evil]].\u2026 [It] is believed to be the nation's largest child molestation prosecution ever directed at a single person, in terms of number of victims and number of alleged criminal acts.<ref>[http://www.ungodlybook.com/factsheet.htm Osinski, Bill.

He was convicted by a jury on January 23, 2004.

(Comet Bennett, which was visible on that date, is said to have really been York\u2019s spacecraft.) York taught that the Motherplane/NIBIRU would launch the Crystal City or New Jerusalem (see: Book of Revelation 21:2) to our solar system from its position in Orion.
