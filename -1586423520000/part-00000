He was the eldest son of Sir William le Scrope (c. 1259 - c. 1312), who was bailiff to the [[earl of Richmond]] in [[Richmondshire]]. Henry's younger brother [[Geoffrey le Scrope|Geoffrey]] was also a lawyer who probably advanced through the influence of his older brother. Geoffrey served as Chief Justice four times between 1324 and 1338.\n\nHenry was an advocate at the [[King's Bench]] by 1292, and had various judicial commissions in the years from 1306 to 1308. On 27 November 1308 he was appointed justice of the common pleas. His friendship with, and the work he did for [[Henry de Lacy, 3rd Earl of Lincoln|Henry Lacy, earl of Lincoln]], helped his advancement at court, where he became a strong supporter of King [[Edward II of England|Edward II]]. In 1311, after the barons had forced the king to accept the restrictions of the so-called [[Ordinances of 1311|Ordinances]], Scrope withdrew from [[English Parliament|Parliament]] in protest, but was promptly ordered by the king to return. On 15 June 1317, when the king was once more restored to full power, Scrope was promoted to Chief Justice of the King's Bench. It was during this period (specifically from [[Hilary term]] 1319) that he instituted the practice of enrolling cases especially pertaining to the king on separate membranes, what became known as the ''Rex'' section.\n\nIn 1322 he received a share of the estates forfeited by the adherents of [[Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster|Thomas, earl of Lancaster]], after the earl's failed rebellion at [[Battle of Boroughbridge|Boroughbridge]]. The next year, however, Scrope was replaced as Chief Justice for reasons that are not quite clear. Still, he did not entirely fall out of favour at court, and on 10 September was appointed justice of the forests north of [[River Trent|Trent]]. He also had the good will of the new regime under [[Edward III of England|Edward III]], and on 5 February 1327 was named 'second justice' of the [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|common pleas]]. From 28 October 1329 to 19 December 1330, while his brother Geoffrey was abroad, he once more took on the post of Chief Justice of the King's Bench. After this he was made [[Chief Baron of the Exchequer]], a post he held until his death.\n\nHenry le Scrope was knighted at some point before February 1311. He held extensive possessions all over England, amounting to twenty-one manors all in all, most of them in [[Yorkshire]]. He was married to a Margaret, perhaps the daughter of either [[Baron de Ros|Lord Ros]] or [[Baron FitzWalter|Lord Fitzwalter]]. Together they had three sons. Margaret outlived him until 1357, and after his death married Sir Hugh Mortimer of [[Chelmarsh]], [[Shropshire]]. When Sir Henry died on 7 September 1336, he was buried in the [[Premonstratensian]] abbey of St Agatha at [[Easby, Richmondshire|Easby]], close to [[Richmond, North Yorkshire|Richmond]]. Of his three sons, the eldest, William, was a soldier who distinguished himself in the French and Scottish wars, and died in 1344. The next brother, Stephen, had predeceased William, so the estates passed to [[Richard le Scrope, 1st Baron Scrope of Bolton|Richard Scrope]], who subsequently became the first [[Baron Scrope of Bolton|Lord Scrope of Bolton]], and [[Lord Chancellor|chancellor of England]].\n\n==References==\n*{{cite ODNB|id=24957|first=Nigel|last=Ramsay|title=Scrope, Sir Henry (b. in or before 1268, d. 1336)}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-legal}}\n{{succession box | title=[[Lord Chief Justice]] | before = [[William Inge (judge)|William Inge]] | after = [[Hervey de Stanton]] | years = 1317\u20131323}}\n|-\n{{succession box | title=[[Lord Chief Justice]] | before = [[Robert de Malberthorp]] | after = [[Geoffrey le Scrope]] | years = 1329\u20131330}}\n|-\n{{succession box | title=[[Chief Justice of the Common Pleas]] | before=[[William Herle|Sir William Herle]] | after=[[William Herle|Sir William Herle]] | years=1333}}\n|-\n{{succession box | title=[[Chief Baron of the Exchequer]] | before=[[John Stonor|Sir John Stonor]] | after=[[Robert Sadington|Sir Robert Sadington]] | years=1334\u20131336}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Scrope, Henry le}}\n[[Category:1260s births]]\n[[Category:1336 deaths]]\n[[Category:English judges]]\n[[Category:Lord Chief Justices of England and Wales]]\n[[Category:Justices of the Common Pleas]]\n[[Category:Chief Barons of the Exchequer]]\n[[Category:Scrope family|Henry]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use British English|date=September 2015}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2015}}\n\n{{Infobox officeholder\n| honorific-prefix   = \n| name               = Sir Henry le Scrope\n| honorific-suffix   = \n| image              = \n| alt                = \n| caption            = \n| order              = 16th\n| office             = Lord Chief Justice of England\n| term_start         = 15 June 1317\n| term_end           = September 1323\n| monarch            = [[Edward II]]\n| primeminister      = [[Thomas, Earl of Lancaster]] (1317-1322)<br>''(as [[Lord High Steward]])''\n| chancellor         = [[John Sandale]] (1317-1318)<br>[[John Hotham (bishop)|John Hotham]] (1318-1320)<br>[[John Salmon (bishop)|John Salmon]] (1320-1323)\n| predecessor        = [[William Inge (judge)|William Inge]]\n| successor          = [[Hervey de Stanton]]\n| prior_term         = \n| order2             = 20th\n| office2            = Lord Chief Justice of England\n| term_start2        = 28 October 1329\n| term_end2          = 19 December 1330\n| monarch2           = [[Edward III]]\n| primeminister2     = [[Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster]]<br>''(as [[Lord High Steward]])''\n| chancellor2        = [[Henry Burghersh]] (1329-1330)<br>[[John de Stratford]] (1330)\n| predecessor2       = [[Robert de Malthorp]]\n| successor2         = [[Geoffrey le Scrope]]\n| prior_term2        = 1317-1323\n| order3             = 24th\n| office3            = Chief Justice of the Common Pleas\n| term_start3        = 1333\n| term_end3          = 1333\n| monarch3           = [[Edward III]]\n| primeminister3     = [[Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster]]<br>''(as Lord High Steward)''\n| chancellor3        = John de Stratford\n| predecessor3       = [[William Herle]]\n| successor3         = William Herle\n| birth_date         = c. 1269\n| death_date         = {{Death date and age|1336|9|7|1269||}}\n| resting_place      = [[Easby Abbey|St Agatha's Abbey]], [[Easby, Richmondshire|Easby]]\n| nationality        = English\n| spouse             = Margaret le Scrope\n| relations          = [[Geoffrey le Scrope]] (younger brother)\n| children           = William le Scrope<br>Stephen le Scrope<br>[[Richard le Scrope, 1st Baron Scrope of Bolton|Richard le Scrope]]\n| parents            = Sir William le Scrope\n}}\n\n'''Sir Henry le Scrope''' (b. in or before 1268 - 7 September 1336) was an [[England|English]] lawyer, and [[Chief Justice of the King's Bench]] for two periods between 1317 and 1330.

In 1311, after the barons had forced the king to accept the restrictions of the so-called [[Ordinances of 1311|Ordinances]], Scrope withdrew from [[English Parliament|Parliament]] in protest, but was promptly ordered by the king to return. On 15 June 1317, when the king was once more restored to full power, Scrope was promoted to Chief Justice of the King's Bench. It was during this period (specifically from [[Hilary term]] 1319) that he instituted the practice of enrolling cases especially pertaining to the king on separate membranes, what became known as the ''Rex'' section.\n\nIn 1322 he received a share of the estates forfeited by the adherents of [[Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster|Thomas, earl of Lancaster]], after the earl's failed rebellion at [[Battle of Boroughbridge|Boroughbridge]]. The next year, however, Scrope was replaced as Chief Justice for reasons that are not quite clear. Still, he did not entirely fall out of favour at court, and on 10 September was appointed justice of the forests north of [[River Trent|Trent]]. He also had the good will of the new regime under [[Edward III of England|Edward III]], and on 5 February 1327 was named 'second justice' of the [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|common pleas]]. From 28 October 1329 to 19 December 1330, while his brother Geoffrey was abroad, he once more took on the post of Chief Justice of the King's Bench. After this he was made [[Chief Baron of the Exchequer]], a post he held until his death.\n\nHenry le Scrope was knighted at some point before February 1311. He held extensive possessions all over England, amounting to twenty-one manors all in all, most of them in [[Yorkshire]]. He was married to a Margaret, perhaps the daughter of either [[Baron de Ros|Lord Ros]] or [[Baron FitzWalter|Lord Fitzwalter]]. Together they had three sons. Margaret outlived him until 1357, and after his death married Sir Hugh Mortimer of [[Chelmarsh]], [[Shropshire]]. When Sir Henry died on 7 September 1336, he was buried in the [[Premonstratensian]] abbey of St Agatha at [[Easby, Richmondshire|Easby]], close to [[Richmond, North Yorkshire|Richmond]]. Of his three sons, the eldest, William, was a soldier who distinguished himself in the French and Scottish wars, and died in 1344. The next brother, Stephen, had predeceased William, so the estates passed to [[Richard le Scrope, 1st Baron Scrope of Bolton|Richard Scrope]], who subsequently became the first [[Baron Scrope of Bolton|Lord Scrope of Bolton]], and [[Lord Chancellor|chancellor of England]].\n\n==References==\n*{{cite ODNB|id=24957|first=Nigel|last=Ramsay|title=Scrope, Sir Henry (b. in or before 1268, d. 1336)}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-legal}}\n{{succession box | title=[[Lord Chief Justice]] | before = [[William Inge (judge)|William Inge]] | after = [[Hervey de Stanton]] | years = 1317\u20131323}}\n|-\n{{succession box | title=[[Lord Chief Justice]] | before = [[Robert de Malberthorp]] | after = [[Geoffrey le Scrope]] | years = 1329\u20131330}}\n|-\n{{succession box | title=[[Chief Justice of the Common Pleas]] | before=[[William Herle|Sir William Herle]] | after=[[William Herle|Sir William Herle]] | years=1333}}\n|-\n{{succession box | title=[[Chief Baron of the Exchequer]] | before=[[John Stonor|Sir John Stonor]] | after=[[Robert Sadington|Sir Robert Sadington]] | years=1334\u20131336}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Scrope, Henry le}}\n[[Category:1260s births]]\n[[Category:1336 deaths]]\n[[Category:English judges]]\n[[Category:Lord Chief Justices of England and Wales]]\n[[Category:Justices of the Common Pleas]]\n[[Category:Chief Barons of the Exchequer]]\n[[Category:Scrope family|Henry]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: \u2019s \u2192 's", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_le_Scrope"}

On 6 November 2004, Ivorians launched an air attack on French [[Peacekeeping|peacekeepers]] in the northern part of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire who were stationed there as part of [[Operation Dingleberry]] (French: ''Op\u00e9ration Licorne''), the [[French military]] operation in support of the [[United Nations Operation in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire]] (UNOCI). French military forces subsequently clashed with Ivorian troops and government-loyal mobs, destroying the entire [[Air Force of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire|Ivorian Air Force]]. Those incidents were followed by massive anti-French protests in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire.\n\n==Background==\nIn 2002, a [[First Ivorian Civil War|civil war broke out]] in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire between Ivorian military and other forces loyal to [[Laurent Gbagbo]], the [[List of heads of state of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire|Ivorian president]] since 2000, and rebel forces identified with the [[Forces Nouvelles de C\u00f4te d'Ivoire]]. Although most of the fighting ended by late 2004, the country remained split in two, with a rebel-held north and a government-held south.\n\n==Ivorian attack on French forces==\nOn 4 November 2004, Gbagbo ordered the counter-offensive to the rebel town of [[Bouak\u00e9]] to be backed by air strikes. France does not react but on 5 November put three [[Dassault Mirage F.1]] jet fighters based in nearby [[Gabon]] on standby.<ref name=\"Smith\"/>\n\nOn 6 November, two Ivorian [[Sukhoi Su-25]] [[bomber]]s, crewed by two Belarusian mercenaries and two Ivorian pilots, fired on the Ivorian rebels led by [[Issiaka Ouattara]]<ref name = Monde>{{cite news|language=fr|first1=Pierre |last1=Lepidi|first2=Charlotte|last2= Bozonnet|title=Bombardement de Bouak\u00e9 en 2004 : vers l\u2019ouverture d\u2019un proc\u00e8s en France|newspaper=[[Le Monde]]|trans-title=2004 bombardment of Bouak\u00e9: to the opening of a trial in France|date=3 July 2018|url=https://www.lemonde.fr/afrique/article/2018/07/03/bombardement-de-bouake-en-2004-vers-l-ouverture-d-un-proces-en-france_5325294_3212.html}}.</ref>.

Protesters erected burning roadblocks, and French gunboats were positioned beneath the bridges. Fighting continued, and, by Sunday, French forces were still not in control of the city.

He was elected bencher in 1633 and reader in 1637 and 1638, but owing to the prevalence of the plague, did not give his reading until Lent 1639. Among his contemporaries at the Inner Temple and his intimate friends were Sir [[Edward Littleton, 1st Baron Lyttleton of Mounslow|Edward Littleton]] (1589\u20131645), afterwards lord keeper and created [[Baron Littleton]]; Sir [[Edward Herbert (politician)|Edward Herbert]], afterwards attorney-general; Sir Thomas Gardiner, afterwards recorder of London; and [[John Selden]], by whose conversation and friendly rivalry he profited in the study of the law and humane learning. Rolle practised with eminent success in the [[Court of King's Bench]].

He early identified himself with the popular party and was unsurpassed by any other member in his vigour to effect the impeachment of [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham]], and was likewise insistent that supply should be postponed to the redress of grievances. On the outbreak of the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] he took the side of Parliament, contributed \u00a3100 to the defence fund, and took the [[Solemn League and Covenant|Covenant]].{{sfn|Rigg|1897|p=162}}\n\n==Judicial career==\nHis advancement to a judgeship in the [[Court of King's Bench]] was one of the stipulations included in the propositions for peace of January 1642\u20133. On 28 October 1645 he was sworn in as such, and on 15 November 1648, further to votes of both houses of parliament, he was advanced to [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales]], otherwise known as Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench. About a week after the execution of King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in 1649, he accepted on 8 February 1649, a new commission as Lord Chief Justice of the upper bench on the understanding that no change should be made to the fundamental laws of the kingdom. On 13 February 1649 he was voted a member of the [[English Council of State|Council of State]], which appointment strengthened the government, and his presence on the [[Circuit judge (England and Wales)|western circuit]] contributed much to the settlement of the public mind.

Rolle was exceeded in his abilities as advocate or judge by none of his contemporaries save by the great Sir [[Matthew Hale (jurist)|Matthew Hale]].\n\nHis decisions, reported by [[William Style]], rarely relate to matters of historic interest. Nevertheless, he established, in the case of Captain Streater, committed to prison by order of the Council of State and the [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Speaker of the House of Commons]] for the publication of seditious writings, the principle that a court of justice cannot review parliamentary commitments if regular in form.{{sfn|Rigg|1897|p=162}}\n\n==Case of Don Pantaleone S\u00e1==\nRolle's name is associated with a ''cause celebre'' of [[international law]]. Don Pantaleone S\u00e1, a brother of the Portuguese ambassador, was arrested for a murder committed in an affray in the New Exchange in the [[Strand, London|Strand]], London. The fact was undeniable, but the Don claimed the privilege of ex-territoriality, due to his being a member of the ambassador's household. The point was discussed by Rolle in consultation with two of his [[Puisne judge|puisnes]], two admiralty judges and two civilians, and on 16 January 1654<ref name=year group=lower-alpha/> was decided against the Don. The decision was without precedent, for it could neither be denied that the Don was of the household of the ambassador, nor that the privilege of ex-territoriality had theretofore been understood to extend even to cases of murder. At the trial on 6 July 1654, over which Rolle presided, the prisoner was conceded a jury, half English half Portuguese, but was denied the assistance of counsel and was compelled to waive his privilege and plead to the indictment by a threat of ''[[peine forte et dure]]''.{{sfn|Rigg|1897|p=162}} He was found guilty and sentenced to death by hanging.

At [[John Penruddock|Penruddock]]'s intercession, however, he was released.\n\n==Resignation==\nHe served as one of the commissioners for the trial of the insurgents at [[Exeter]] in May 1655, and  being unable to decide against the merchant [[George Cony]], who had sued a customs officer for levying duty from him by force without authority of parliament, and rather than give further offence to the [[Lord Protector (Cromwell)|Lord Protector]] [[Oliver Cromwell]] he resigned on 7 June 1655.
