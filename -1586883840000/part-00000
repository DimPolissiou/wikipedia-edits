Introduction to the Penguin Classics Edition, 1985.</ref> (In chapter 3, the character Mr Riley is described as an \"auctioneer and appraiser thirty years ago\", placing the opening events of the novel in approximately 1829, thirty years before the novel's composition in 1859. In chapter 8, Mr Tulliver and Mr Deane discuss the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] and his \"conduct in the Catholic Question\", a conversation that could only take place after 1828, when Wellington became [[Prime minister|Prime Minister]] and supported a bill for Catholic Emancipation). The novel includes many autobiographical elements and reflects the disgrace that George Eliot ([[Mary Ann Evans]]) experienced while in a lengthy relationship with a married man, [[George Henry Lewes]].\n[[File:An idyllic location - geograph.org.uk - 894101.jpg|thumb|[[Bintry Watermill]], which depicted Dorlcote Mill in the 1997 TV series.]]\nMaggie Tulliver is the protagonist and the story begins when she is 9 years old, 13 years into her parents' marriage. Her relationship with her older brother Tom, and her romantic relationships with Philip Wakem (a hunchbacked, sensitive and intellectual friend) and with Stephen Guest (a vivacious young socialite in St Ogg's and assumed fianc\u00e9 of Maggie's cousin Lucy Deane) constitute the most significant narrative threads.\n\nTom and Maggie have a close yet complex bond, which continues throughout the novel. Their relationship is coloured by Maggie's desire to recapture the unconditional love of her father before his death. Tom's pragmatic and reserved nature clashes with Maggie's idealism and fervor for intellectual gains and experience. Various family crises, including bankruptcy, Mr Tulliver's rancorous relationship with Philip Wakem's father, which results in the loss of the mill and Mr Tulliver's untimely death, intensify Tom's and Maggie's differences and highlight their love for each other. To help his father repay his debts, Tom leaves school to enter a life of the business. He eventually finds a measure of success, restoring the family's former estate. Maggie languishes in the impoverished Tulliver home, her intellectual aptitude wasted in her socially isolated state. She passes through a period of tough spirituality, during which she renounces the world, motivated by her reading of [[Thomas \u00e0 Kempis]]'s [[The Imitation of Christ (book)|'' The Imitation of Christ'']].\n\nThis renunciation is tested by a renewed friendship with Philip Wakem, with whom she had developed a friendship while he and Tom were students. Against the wishes of Tom and her father - who both despise the Wakems - Maggie secretly meets with Philip and they go for long walks through the woods. The relationship they forge is founded partly in Maggie's heartfelt pity for broken and neglected human beings but it also serves as an outlet for her intellectual romantic desires. Philip's and Maggie's attraction is, in any case, inconsequential because of the family antipathy. Philip manages to coax a pledge of love from Maggie. When Tom discovers the relationship between the two, he forces his sister to renounce Philip, and with him her hopes of experiencing the broader, more cultured world he represents.\n\nSeveral years pass, during which Mr Tulliver dies. Lucy Deane invites Maggie to come and stay with her and experience the life of cultured leisure that she enjoys. This includes long hours conversing and playing music with Lucy's suitor, Stephen Guest, a prominent St Ogg's resident. Stephen and Maggie, against their rational judgments, become attracted to each other. The complication is compounded by Philip Wakem's friendship with Lucy and Stephen; he and Maggie are reintroduced and Philip's love for her is rekindled, while Maggie, no longer isolated, enjoys the clandestine attentions of Stephen Guest, putting her past profession of love for Philip in question. Lucy intrigues to throw Philip and Maggie together on a short rowing trip down the Floss but Stephen unwittingly takes a sick Philip's place. \n\nWhen Maggie and Stephen find themselves floating down the river, negligent of the distance they have covered, he proposes that they board a passing boat to the next substantial city, Mudport and get married. Maggie is too tired to argue about it. Stephen takes advantage of her weariness and hails the boat. They are taken on board and during the trip to Mudport, Maggie struggles between her love for Stephen and her duties to Philip and Lucy, which were established when she was poor, isolated and dependent on them for what good her life contained. Upon arrival in Mudport, she rejects Stephen and makes her way back to St Ogg's, where she lives for a brief period as an outcast, Stephen having fled to Holland. Although she immediately goes to Tom for forgiveness and shelter, he roughly sends her away, telling her that she will never again be welcome under his roof. Lucy and Philip forgive her, in a moving reunion and in an eloquent letter, respectively.\n\nMaggie's brief exile ends when the river floods. Having struggled through the waters in a boat to find Tom at the old mill, she sets out with him to rescue Lucy Deane and her family. In a brief tender moment, the brother and sister are reconciled from all past differences. When their boat capsizes, the two drown in an embrace, thus giving the book its Biblical epigraph: \"In their death, they were not divided\".<ref>2 Samuel I:23</ref>\n\n==Characters==\n[[File:Tom and Maggie.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Tom and Maggie Tulliver]]\n* Maggie Tulliver \u2013 a dark-complexioned miller's daughter.

A certain determinism is at play throughout the novel, from Mr Tulliver's grossly imprudent inability to keep himself from \"going to law\", and thereby losing his patrimony and bankrupting his family, to the series of events that sets Maggie and Stephen down the river and past the point of no return. Characters such as Mr Tulliver are presented as unable to determine their own course rationally, while various external forces, be it the drift of the river or the force of a flood, are presented as determining the courses of people for them. On the other hand, Maggie's ultimate choice not to marry Stephen, and to suffer both the privation of his love and the ignominy of their botched elopement demonstrates a final triumph of free will.\n\nCritics have asserted that Maggie's need for love and acceptance is her underlying motivation throughout ''The Mill on the Floss'', claiming that the conflicts that arise in the novel invariably stem from her frustrated attempts at gaining this acceptance. Alan Bellringer has claimed that  \"[t]he two main themes of the novel, growing up and falling in love, lend themselves to amusement, but it is stunted growth and frustrated love that are emphasized.\" Commentators have often focused on the constant rejection of Maggie's talents and mannerisms by her family and society. Even the cultural norms of her community deny her intellectual and spiritual growth. According to Elizabeth Ermarth, \"[t]hey are norms according to which she is an inferior, dependent creature who will never go far in anything, and which consequently are a denial of her full humanity.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ermarth|first=Elizabeth|date=1974|title=Maggie Tulliver's Long Suicide|url=|journal=SEL: Studies in English Literature 1500\u20131900|volume=14|pages=587\u2013601|via=Jstor}}</ref>\n\n==Adaptations==\nThe story was adapted as a film, ''[[The Mill on the Floss (film)|The Mill on the Floss]]'', in 1937, and as a BBC series in 1978 starring [[Christopher Blake]], [[Pippa Guard]], [[Judy Cornwell]], [[Ray Smith (actor)|Ray Smith]] and [[Anton Lesser]].\n\nA single-episode television adaptation of the novel was first aired on 1 January 1997.

Both the river and the village are fictional.<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last1                 = Henry\n| first1                = Nancy\n| title                 = The Life of George Eliot: A Critical Biography\n| URL                   = https://books.google.com/books?id=rCAONFysUsEC\n| series                = Wiley Blackwell Critical Biographies\n| publisher             = John Wiley & Sons\n| publication-date      = 2012\n| page                  = 26\n| ISBN                  = 9781405137058\n| access-date            = 2016-01-28\n| quote                 = The image of coal-laden ships floating into port that opens The Mill on the Floss seems to be informed by a memory of coal barges on the canal from Mary Ann's childhood and transferred to her fictional River Floss[...].\n| date                = 2012-05-07\n}}\n</ref>\n\nThe novel begins in the late 1820s or early 1830s \u2013 several historical references place the events in the book after the [[Napoleonic Wars]] but before the [[Reform Act 1832|Reform Act of 1832]].<ref>Byatt, A.S. Introduction to the Penguin Classics Edition, 1985.</ref> (In chapter 3, the character Mr Riley is described as an \"auctioneer and appraiser thirty years ago\", placing the opening events of the novel in approximately 1829, thirty years before the novel's composition in 1859. In chapter 8, Mr Tulliver and Mr Deane discuss the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] and his \"conduct in the Catholic Question\", a conversation that could only take place after 1828, when Wellington became [[Prime minister|Prime Minister]] and supported a bill for Catholic Emancipation). The novel includes many autobiographical elements and reflects the disgrace that George Eliot ([[Mary Ann Evans]]) experienced while in a lengthy relationship with a married man, [[George Henry Lewes]].\n[[File:An idyllic location - geograph.org.uk - 894101.jpg|thumb|[[Bintry Watermill]], which depicted Dorlcote Mill in the 1997 TV series.]]\nMaggie Tulliver is the protagonist and the story begins when she is 9 years old, 13 years into her parents' marriage. Her relationship with her older brother Tom, and her romantic relationships with Philip Wakem (a hunchbacked, sensitive and intellectual friend) and with Stephen Guest (a vivacious young socialite in St Ogg's and assumed fianc\u00e9 of Maggie's cousin Lucy Deane) constitute the most significant narrative threads.\n\nTom and Maggie have a close yet complex bond, which continues throughout the novel. Their relationship is coloured by Maggie's desire to recapture the unconditional love of her father before his death. Tom's pragmatic and reserved nature clashes with Maggie's idealism and fervor for intellectual gains and experience. Various family crises, including bankruptcy, Mr Tulliver's rancorous relationship with Philip Wakem's father, which results in the loss of the mill and Mr Tulliver's untimely death, intensify Tom's and Maggie's differences and highlight their love for each other. To help his father repay his debts, Tom leaves school to enter a life of the business. He eventually finds a measure of success, restoring the family's former estate. Maggie languishes in the impoverished Tulliver home, her intellectual aptitude wasted in her socially isolated state. She passes through a period of tough spirituality, during which she renounces the world, motivated by her reading of [[Thomas \u00e0 Kempis]]'s [[The Imitation of Christ (book)|'' The Imitation of Christ'']].\n\nThis renunciation is tested by a renewed friendship with Philip Wakem, with whom she had developed a friendship while he and Tom were students. Against the wishes of Tom and her father - who both despise the Wakems - Maggie secretly meets with Philip and they go for long walks through the woods. The relationship they forge is founded partly in Maggie's heartfelt pity for broken and neglected human beings but it also serves as an outlet for her intellectual romantic desires. Philip's and Maggie's attraction is, in any case, inconsequential because of the family antipathy. Philip manages to coax a pledge of love from Maggie. When Tom discovers the relationship between the two, he forces his sister to renounce Philip, and with him her hopes of experiencing the broader, more cultured world he represents.\n\nSeveral years pass, during which Mr Tulliver dies. Lucy Deane invites Maggie to come and stay with her and experience the life of cultured leisure that she enjoys. This includes long hours conversing and playing music with Lucy's suitor, Stephen Guest, a prominent St Ogg's resident. Stephen and Maggie, against their rational judgments, become attracted to each other. The complication is compounded by Philip Wakem's friendship with Lucy and Stephen; he and Maggie are reintroduced and Philip's love for her is rekindled, while Maggie, no longer isolated, enjoys the clandestine attentions of Stephen Guest, putting her past profession of love for Philip in question. Lucy intrigues to throw Philip and Maggie together on a short rowing trip down the Floss but Stephen unwittingly takes a sick Philip's place. \n\nWhen Maggie and Stephen find themselves floating down the river, negligent of the distance they have covered, he proposes that they board a passing boat to the next substantial city, Mudport and get married. Maggie is too tired to argue about it. Stephen takes advantage of her weariness and hails the boat. They are taken on board and during the trip to Mudport, Maggie struggles between her love for Stephen and her duties to Philip and Lucy, which were established when she was poor, isolated and dependent on them for what good her life contained. Upon arrival in Mudport, she rejects Stephen and makes her way back to St Ogg's, where she lives for a brief period as an outcast, Stephen having fled to Holland. Although she immediately goes to Tom for forgiveness and shelter, he roughly sends her away, telling her that she will never again be welcome under his roof. Lucy and Philip forgive her, in a moving reunion and in an eloquent letter, respectively.\n\nMaggie's brief exile ends when the river floods. Having struggled through the waters in a boat to find Tom at the old mill, she sets out with him to rescue Lucy Deane and her family. In a brief tender moment, the brother and sister are reconciled from all past differences. When their boat capsizes, the two drown in an embrace, thus giving the book its Biblical epigraph: \"In their death, they were not divided\".<ref>2 Samuel I:23</ref>\n\n==Characters==\n[[File:Tom and Maggie.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Tom and Maggie Tulliver]]\n* Maggie Tulliver \u2013 a dark-complexioned miller's daughter.

A certain determinism is at play throughout the novel, from Mr Tulliver's grossly imprudent inability to keep himself from \"going to law\", and thereby losing his patrimony and bankrupting his family, to the series of events that sets Maggie and Stephen down the river and past the point of no return. Characters such as Mr Tulliver are presented as unable to determine their own course rationally, while various external forces, be it the drift of the river or the force of a flood, are presented as determining the courses of people for them. On the other hand, Maggie's ultimate choice not to marry Stephen, and to suffer both the privation of his love and the ignominy of their botched elopement demonstrates a final triumph of free will.\n\nCritics have asserted that Maggie's need for love and acceptance is her underlying motivation throughout ''The Mill on the Floss'', claiming that the conflicts that arise in the novel invariably stem from her frustrated attempts at gaining this acceptance. Alan Bellringer has claimed that  \"[t]he two main themes of the novel, growing up and falling in love, lend themselves to amusement, but it is stunted growth and frustrated love that are emphasized.\" Commentators have often focused on the constant rejection of Maggie's talents and mannerisms by her family and society. Even the cultural norms of her community deny her intellectual and spiritual growth. According to Elizabeth Ermarth, \"[t]hey are norms according to which she is an inferior, dependent creature who will never go far in anything, and which consequently are a denial of her full humanity.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ermarth|first=Elizabeth|date=1974|title=Maggie Tulliver's Long Suicide|url=|journal=SEL: Studies in English Literature 1500\u20131900|volume=14|pages=587\u2013601|via=Jstor}}</ref>\n\n==Adaptations==\nThe story was adapted as a film, ''[[The Mill on the Floss (film)|The Mill on the Floss]]'', in 1937, and as a BBC series in 1978 starring [[Christopher Blake]], [[Pippa Guard]], [[Judy Cornwell]], [[Ray Smith (actor)|Ray Smith]] and [[Anton Lesser]].\n\nA single-episode television adaptation of the novel first was aired on 1 January 1997.

The climatic conditions attracted the British to establish the city in the dense forests of [[Himalayas]]. As the summer capital, Shimla hosted many important political meetings including the [[Simla Accord (1914)|Simla Accord of 1914]] and the [[Simla Conference]] of 1945. After independence, The state of [[Himachal Pradesh]] came into being in 1948 as a result of integration of 28 [[princely state]]s. Even after independence, the city remained an important political centre, hosting the [[Simla Agreement]] of 1972. After reorganisation of state of Himachal Pradesh, the existing Mahasu district was named Shimla.\n\nShimla is home to a number of buildings that are styled in the [[Tudorbethan]] and [[neo-Gothic]] architectures dating from the colonial era, as well as multiple temples and churches. The colonial architecture and churches, the temples and the natural environment of the city attracts tourists. Attractions include the [[Rashtrapati Niwas|Viceregal Lodge]], the [[Christ Church (Shimla)|Christ Church]], the [[Jakhoo|Jakhoo Temple]], the [[Mall Road, Shimla|Mall Road]], [[The Ridge, Shimla|the Ridge]] and [[Annadale, Shimla|Annadale]] which together form the city centre. The [[Kalka\u2013Shimla Railway]] line built by the British, a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]], is also a major tourist attraction. Owing to its steep terrain, Shimla hosts the mountain biking race [[MTB Himalaya]], which started in 2005 and is regarded as the biggest event of its kind in South Asia. Shimla also has the largest [[Ice rink|natural ice skating rink]] in South Asia. Apart from being a tourism centre, the city is also an educational hub with a number of colleges and research institutions.\n\n==History==\nMost of the area occupied by present-day Shimla city was dense forest during the 18th century.

The [[British East India Company]] took control of the territory as per the [[Sugauli Treaty]] after the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] (1814\u201316). The [[Gurkha]] leaders were quelled by storming the fort of Malaun under the command of [[David Ochterlony]] in May 1815. In a diary entry dated 30 August 1817, the Gerard brothers, who surveyed the area, describe Shimla as \"a middling-sized village where a fakir is situated to give water to the travellers\". In 1819, Lieutenant Ross, the Assistant Political Agent in the [[Hill States of India#|Hill States]], set up a wood cottage in Shimla. Three years later, his successor and the [[Scotland|Scottish]] civil servant [[Charles Pratt Kennedy]] built the first [[pucca housing|pucca house]] in the area in 1822, near [[Annadale, Shimla|Annadale]], what is now the [[Himachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly]] building. The accounts of the Britain-like climate started attracting several British officers to the area during the hot Indian summers. By 1826, some officers had started spending their entire vacation in Shimla. In 1827, [[William Amherst, 1st Earl Amherst|Lord Amherst]], the [[Governor-General of Bengal]], visited Shimla and stayed in the Kennedy House. A year later, [[Stapleton Cotton, 1st Viscount Combermere|Lord Combermere]], the Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in India, stayed at the same residence. During his stay, a three-mile road and a bridge were constructed near [[Jakhoo]]. In 1830, the British acquired the surrounding land from the chiefs of [[Keonthal]] and [[Patiala]] in exchange for the Rawin [[pargana]] and a portion of the Bharauli pargana.

After this, the town was under Nawab (King) Kumar Ghosal of Bally, West Bengal and saw regular visits from the Governors General and Commanders-in-Chief of British India. A number of young British officers started visiting the area to socialise with the higher-ups; they were followed by ladies looking for marriage alliances for their relatives. Shimla thus became a hill station famous for balls, parties and other festivities. Subsequently, residential schools for pupils from upper-class families were established nearby. By the late 1830s, the city also became a centre for theatre and art exhibitions. As the population increased, a number of bungalows were built and a big bazaar was established in the town. The Indian businessmen, mainly from [[Sood]] and [[Parsi]] communities, arrived in the area to cater to the needs of the growing European population. On 9 September 1844 the foundation of the [[Christ Church (Shimla)|Christ Church]] was laid. Subsequently, several roads were widened and the construction of the [[National Highway 22 (India)|Hindustan-Tibet road]] with a 560-feet tunnel was taken up in 1851\u201352. This tunnel, now known as the Dhalli Tunnel, was started by a Major Briggs in 1850 and completed in the winter of 1851\u201352.<ref name=\"tunnel\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2008/20080206/himplus1.htm#2 |title=Shimla A five-tunnel town|publisher=tribuneindia.com|accessdate=16 August 2015}}</ref> The [[1857 uprising]] caused a panic among the European residents of the town, but Shimla remained largely unaffected by the rebellion.<ref name=\"Vipin1996\"/>\n\nIn 1863, the [[Viceroy of India]], [[John Lawrence, 1st Baron Lawrence|John Lawrence]], decided to shift the summer capital of the British Raj to Shimla.<ref name=\"Vipin1996\" /> He took the trouble of moving the administration twice a year between [[Calcutta]] and this separate centre over 1,000 miles away, despite the fact that it was difficult to reach.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[Charles Allen (writer)|Charles Allen]], ''[[Kipling Sahib]]'', London, Little Brown, 2007</ref> [[Robert Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Earl of Lytton|Lord Lytton]] ([[Viceroy of India]] 1876\u20131880) made efforts to plan the town from 1876, when he first stayed in a rented house, but began plans for a [[Rashtrapati Niwas|Viceregal Lodge]], later built on Observatory Hill.

British soldiers, merchants and civil servants moved here each year to escape from the heat during summer in the [[Indo-Gangetic plain]]. The presence of many bachelors and unattached men, as well as the many women passing the hot weather there, gave Shimla a reputation for adultery, and at least gossip about adultery: as [[Rudyard Kipling]] said in a letter cited by Allen, it had a reputation for \"frivolity, gossip and intrigue\".<ref name=\"heritagereport\">{{cite web | url = http://himachal.nic.in/tcp/ShimlaHeritageReport.pdf | title = Heritage of Shimla | publisher = Town & Country Planning Department, Shimla | accessdate = 4 May 2007 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070630171701/http://himachal.nic.in/tcp/ShimlaHeritageReport.pdf | archivedate = 30 June 2007 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe {{convert|500|ft|adj=on}} Lower Bazaar tunnel was built in 1905 and christened Khachhar Surang.

In 1864, Shimla was declared as the [[summer capital]] of [[British Raj|British India]], succeeding [[Murree]], northeast of [[Rawalpindi]]. After [[Indian independence movement|independence]], the city became the capital of [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] and was later made the capital of [[Himachal Pradesh]].

The climatic conditions attracted the British to establish the city in the dense forests of [[Himalayas]]. As the summer capital, Shimla hosted many important political meetings including the [[Simla Accord (1914)|Simla Accord of 1914]] and the [[Simla Conference]] of 1945. After independence, The state of [[Himachal Pradesh]] came into being in 1948 as a result of integration of 28 [[princely state]]s. Even after independence, the city remained an important political centre, hosting the [[Simla Agreement]] of 1972. After reorganisation of state of Himachal Pradesh, the existing Mahasu district was named Shimla.\n\nShimla is home to a number of buildings that are styled in the [[Tudorbethan]] and [[neo-Gothic]] architectures dating from the colonial era, as well as multiple temples and churches. The colonial architecture and churches, the temples and the natural environment of the city attracts tourists. Attractions include the [[Rashtrapati Niwas|Viceregal Lodge]], the [[Christ Church (Shimla)|Christ Church]], the [[Jakhoo|Jakhoo Temple]], the [[Mall Road, Shimla|Mall Road]], [[The Ridge, Shimla|the Ridge]] and [[Annadale, Shimla|Annadale]] which together form the city centre. The [[Kalka\u2013Shimla Railway]] line built by the British, a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]], is also a major tourist attraction. Owing to its steep terrain, Shimla hosts the mountain biking race [[MTB Himalaya]], which started in 2005 and is regarded as the biggest event of its kind in South Asia. Shimla also has the largest [[Ice rink|natural ice skating rink]] in South Asia. Apart from being a tourism centre, the city is also an educational hub with a number of colleges and research institutions.\n\n==History==\nMost of the area occupied by present-day Shimla city was dense forest during the 18th century. The only civilisation was the [[Jakhoo]] temple and a few scattered houses.<ref name=\"Vipin1996\">{{cite book | author=Vipin Pubby | title=Shimla Then and Now | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UrZ-ibfhMyMC&pg=PA17 | accessdate=16 August 2013 | year=1996 | publisher=Indus Publishing | isbn=978-81-7387-046-0 | pages=17\u201334}}</ref> The area was called 'Shimla', named after a [[Hindu goddess]], ''Shyamala Devi'', an incarnation of [[Kali]].<ref name=\"hpshimla.nic.in\"/>\n\n[[File:Shimla, 1850s.jpg|left|thumb|The bridge connecting Shimla with Chhota Shimla, originally erected in 1829 by Lord Combermere, Shimla, 1850s]]\nThe area of present-day Shimla was invaded and captured by [[Bhimsen Thapa]] of [[Nepal]] in 1806. The [[British East India Company]] took control of the territory as per the [[Sugauli Treaty]] after the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] (1814\u201316). The [[Gurkha]] leaders were quelled by storming the fort of Malaun under the command of [[David Ochterlony]] in May 1815. In a diary entry dated 30 August 1817, the Gerard brothers, who surveyed the area, describe Shimla as \"a middling-sized village where a fakir is situated to give water to the travellers\". In 1819, Lieutenant Ross, the Assistant Political Agent in the [[Hill States of India#|Hill States]], set up a wood cottage in Shimla. Three years later, his successor and the [[Scotland|Scottish]] civil servant [[Charles Pratt Kennedy]] built the first [[pucca housing|pucca house]] in the area in 1822, near [[Annadale, Shimla|Annadale]], what is now the [[Himachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly]] building. The accounts of the Britain-like climate started attracting several British officers to the area during the hot Indian summers. By 1826, some officers had started spending their entire vacation in Shimla. In 1827, [[William Amherst, 1st Earl Amherst|Lord Amherst]], the [[Governor-General of Bengal]], visited Shimla and stayed in the Kennedy House. A year later, [[Stapleton Cotton, 1st Viscount Combermere|Lord Combermere]], the Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in India, stayed at the same residence. During his stay, a three-mile road and a bridge were constructed near [[Jakhoo]]. In 1830, the British acquired the surrounding land from the chiefs of [[Keonthal]] and [[Patiala]] in exchange for the Rawin [[pargana]] and a portion of the Bharauli pargana. The settlement grew rapidly after this, from 30 houses in 1830 to 1,141 houses in 1881.<ref name=\"Vipin1996\"/><ref>{{cite book|author=Harrop, F.

In a letter to Colonel Churchill, he wrote:<ref>Researches and Missionary Labours Among the Jews, Mohammedans, and Other Sects By Joseph Wolff, published by O.

After this, the town was under Nawab (King) Kumar Ghosal of Bally, West Bengal and saw regular visits from the Governors General and Commanders-in-Chief of British India. A number of young British officers started visiting the area to socialise with the higher-ups; they were followed by ladies looking for marriage alliances for their relatives. Shimla thus became a hill station famous for balls, parties and other festivities. Subsequently, residential schools for pupils from upper-class families were established nearby. By the late 1830s, the city also became a centre for theatre and art exhibitions. As the population increased, a number of bungalows were built and a big bazaar was established in the town. The Indian businessmen, mainly from [[Sood]] and [[Parsi]] communities, arrived in the area to cater to the needs of the growing European population. On 9 September 1844 the foundation of the [[Christ Church (Shimla)|Christ Church]] was laid. Subsequently, several roads were widened and the construction of the [[National Highway 22 (India)|Hindustan-Tibet road]] with a 560-feet tunnel was taken up in 1851\u201352. This tunnel, now known as the Dhalli Tunnel, was started by a Major Briggs in 1850 and completed in the winter of 1851\u201352.<ref name=\"tunnel\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2008/20080206/himplus1.htm#2 |title=Shimla A five-tunnel town|publisher=tribuneindia.com|accessdate=16 August 2015}}</ref> The [[1857 uprising]] caused a panic among the European residents of the town, but Shimla remained largely unaffected by the rebellion.<ref name=\"Vipin1996\"/>\n\nIn 1863, the [[Viceroy of India]], [[John Lawrence, 1st Baron Lawrence|John Lawrence]], decided to shift the summer capital of the British Raj to Shimla.<ref name=\"Vipin1996\" /> He took the trouble of moving the administration twice a year between [[Calcutta]] and this separate centre over 1,000 miles away, despite the fact that it was difficult to reach.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[Charles Allen (writer)|Charles Allen]], ''[[Kipling Sahib]]'', London, Little Brown, 2007</ref> [[Robert Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Earl of Lytton|Lord Lytton]] ([[Viceroy of India]] 1876\u20131880) made efforts to plan the town from 1876, when he first stayed in a rented house, but began plans for a [[Rashtrapati Niwas|Viceregal Lodge]], later built on Observatory Hill. A fire cleared much of the area where the native Indian population lived (the \"Upper Bazaar\" nowadays known as the [[The Ridge, Shimla|Ridge]]<ref name=\"harisud\">{{cite book | author=Hari Sud | title=Entrepreneurs of British Shimla | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N8aRBQAAQBAJ | accessdate=15 August 2015 | year=2013 | publisher=Lulu | isbn=978-1-304-11357-3 | pages=73\u201374}}</ref>), and the planning of the eastern end to become the centre of the European town forced them to live in the Middle and Lower Bazaars on the lower terraces descending the steep slopes from the Ridge. The Upper Bazaar was cleared for a town hall, with many facilities such as library and theatre, as well as offices for police and military volunteers as well as municipal administration.\n\nDuring the \"Hot Weather\", Shimla was also the Headquarters of the [[Commander-in-Chief, India]], the head of the [[British Indian Army|Indian Army]], and many departments of [[Government of India|the government]]. The summer capital of the regional Government of the [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]] moved from [[Murree]], in modern-day [[Pakistan]], to Shimla in 1876. They were joined by many of the British wives and daughters of the men who remained on the plains. Together these formed Shimla Society, which, according to [[Charles Allen (writer)|Charles Allen]],<ref>''[[Kipling Sahib]]'', London, Little Brown, 2007: p. 134</ref> \"was as close as British India ever came to having an upper crust.\" This may have been helped by the fact that it was very expensive, having an ideal climate and thus being desirable, as well as having limited accommodation. British soldiers, merchants and civil servants moved here each year to escape from the heat during summer in the [[Indo-Gangetic plain]]. The presence of many bachelors and unattached men, as well as the many women passing the hot weather there, gave Shimla a reputation for adultery, and at least gossip about adultery: as [[Rudyard Kipling]] said in a letter cited by Allen, it had a reputation for \"frivolity, gossip and intrigue\".<ref name=\"heritagereport\">{{cite web | url = http://himachal.nic.in/tcp/ShimlaHeritageReport.pdf | title = Heritage of Shimla | publisher = Town & Country Planning Department, Shimla | accessdate = 4 May 2007 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070630171701/http://himachal.nic.in/tcp/ShimlaHeritageReport.pdf | archivedate = 30 June 2007 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe {{convert|500|ft|adj=on}} Lower Bazaar tunnel was built in 1905 and christened Khachhar Surang.

He claimed that the circle of stars was based on the iconographic tradition of showing the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Blessed Virgin Mary]] as the [[Woman of the Apocalypse]], wearing a \"crown of twelve stars\".<ref name=\"Economist\"/><ref name=\"Gialdino\">Carlo Curti Gialdino, ''I Simboli dell'Unione europea, Bandiera - Inno - Motto - Moneta - Giornata''.

G. Levy and the recent reconstruction by Susan Hood, crediting Ars\u00e8ne Heitz with the original design still seems to me the soundest option. In particular, Ars\u00e8ne Heitz himself, in 1987, laid claim to his own role in designing the flag and to its religious inspiration when he said that 'the flag of Europe is the flag of Our Lady' [''Magnificat'' magazine, 1987].\n\n\"Secondly, it is worth noting the testimony of Father Pierre Caillon, who refers to a meeting with Ars\u00e8ne Heitz. Caillon tells of having met the former Council of Europe employee by chance in August 1987 at Lisieux in front of the Carmelite monastery. It was Heitz who stopped him and declared 'I was the one who designed the European flag. I suddenly had the idea of putting the 12 stars of the Miraculous Medal of the Rue du Bac on a blue field. My proposal was adopted unanimously on 8 December 1955, the Feast of the Immaculate Conception. I am telling you this, Father, because you are wearing the little blue cross of the Blue Army of Our Lady of Fatima'\".</ref> The French satirical magazine ''[[Le Canard encha\u00een\u00e9]]'' reacted to Heitz's statement with an article entitled ''L\u2019Europe viol\u00e9e par la Sainte Vierge'' (\"Europe Raped by the Blessed Virgin\") in the edition of 20 December 1989. Heitz also made a connection to the date of the flag's adoption, 8 December 1955, coinciding with the Catholic [[Feast of the Immaculate Conception]] of the Blessed Virgin Mary.\n\n[[Paul M. G. L\u00e9vy]], then Director of Information at the Council of Europe responsible for designing the flag, in a 1989 statement maintained that he had not been aware of any religious connotations.<ref>{{citation |title=European Union: Myths on the flag |origyear=1995 |year=2002 |publisher=[[Flags of the World]] |url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/eu!myt.html |accessdate=4 August 2007}} \"While Count Coudenhove-Kalergi in a personal statement maintained that three leading Catholics within the Council had subconsciously chosen the twelve stars on the model of Apocalypse 12:1, Paul M.G. L\u00e9vy, Press Officer of the Council from 1949 to 1966, explained in 1989 that there was no religious intention whatsoever associated with the choice of the circle of twelve stars.\" Peter Diem, 11 June 2002.</ref>\n\nIn an interview given 26 February 1998, L\u00e9vy denied not only awareness of the \"Marian\" connection, but also denied that the final design of a circle of twelve stars was Heitz's. To the question \"Who really designed the flag?\" L\u00e9vy replied:\n\n: \"I did, and I calculated the proportions to be used for the geometric design. Ars\u00e8ne Heitz, who was an employee in the mail service, put in all sorts of proposals, including the 15-star design. But he submitted too many designs. He wanted to do the European currencies with 15 stars in the corner. He wanted to do national flags incorporating the Council of Europe flag.\"<ref name=\"Gialdino\"/>\n\nCarlo Curti Gialdino (2005) has reconstructed the design process to the effect that Heitz's proposal contained varying numbers of stars, from which the version with twelve stars was chosen by the Committee of Ministers meeting at Deputy level in January 1955 as one out of two remaining candidate designs.<ref name=\"Gialdino\"/>\n\nL\u00e9vy's 1998 interview apparently gave rise to a new variant of the \"Marian\" anecdote. An article published in ''{{lang|de|[[Die Welt]]}}'' in August 1998 alleged that it was L\u00e9vy himself who was inspired to introduce a \"Marian\" element as he walked past a statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary.<ref>{{cite news |last=Pinzka |first=Thomas |url=https://www.welt.de/print-welt/article625491/Der-Sternenkranz-ist-die-Folge-eines-Geluebdes.html |title=Der Sternenkranz ist die Folge eines Gel\u00fcbdes |trans-title=The crown of stars is the result of a vote |newspaper=[[Die Welt]] |date=26 August 1998 |accessdate=3 November 2018|language=de}}</ref>\n\nAn article posted in ''La Raison'' in February 2000 further connected the donation of a stained glass window for [[Strasbourg Cathedral]] by the Council of Europe on 21 October 1956.

These first proposals were made 19th January 1950 by Paul Levy in a letter to the Secr\u00e9tarie G\u00e9neral. He proposed that the flag should contain a cross for several reasons. Firstly, the cross symbolizes roads crossing, and also represents the east, the west, the north, and the south with its arms. Furthermore, the cross appears in most of the european council members' flags, and it is the oldest and most noble symbol in Europe. Moreover, the cross depicted christianity. As far as the colours are concerned, he proposed them to be white and green, colours of the European Movement, which was of great significance since 1947. Green also depicted hope, and the green cross over a white background was a design that had not been used yet. Finally, Levy proposed that the arms of Strasbourg was an important element to be added as it represented where the Council would be, and being located in the heart of the cross meant that the Council was the point where the european roads met.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=09000016806998d8|title=Memorandum from Paul Levy to Jacques-Camille Paris (Secretary General) about having a cross on the European flag|last=|first=|date=January 19, 2020|website=Council of Europe|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nShortly after this design considerations by Paul Levy, on the 27th July 1950, Richard Coudenhove-Kalergi, president of the pan-european movement wrote a memorandum which contained some rules that a flag for such union should follow. The rules he stated where:\n\n* It should be a symbol of our common civilisation.\n* It should present a European emblem.\n* It should not provoke any national rivalry.\n* It should represent tradition.\n* It should be beautiful and dignified.\n\nAfter this statements, Coudenhove-Kalergi proposed that the [[Paneuropean Union|Pan-European movement flag]] would be the perfect one to fit this criteria<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=0900001680699d97|title=Memorandumpresented to the Council of Europe by Richard Coudenhove-Kalergi|last=|first=|date=January 26, 2020|website=Council of Europe|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>.\n\nThe 15th July [[1951]], the consultative assembly put forward a final memorandum on the European flag.

They could be green on a white background, white stars on a red background, or silver stars for associate members, and golden stars for full members.\n* Strasbourg's CoA: This coat of arms would symbolize the official seat of the [[Council of Europe]].\n* A sun: It would represent dawning hope.\n* A triangle: It would represent culture.\n\nFurthermore, several colours were also proposed:\n\n* Multi-Coloured: It was proposed that the flag could contain all the colours the flags of the member states had.\n* Green and White: This were the colours of the [[Federalist flag|European Movement]].\n* Sky Blue: Symbol of peace and neutrality, as other colours were already used for other movements such as black for mouring, red for bolshvism, or green for islam.\n\nIn the end, the flag of europe was chosen to have 12 five-pointed golden stars in a circle over a blue background, probably inspired by the Pan-European flag and other designs such as Salvador de Madriaga's and Ars\u00e8ne Heitz's proposals.\n\n=== Timeline of Flag Proposals ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:110px;\" |Flag !! style=\"width:100px;\" |Date{{Efn|Some flags were proposed on several occasions.

He also proposed these two designs to have a blue background.\nThe council put forward this proposal, which had a green flag with a white and red Star of Liberation, and the Strasbourg coat of arms on the upper left-hand corner. The star in a circle was in 1944-5 the insignia of the armies of Liberation.\n|<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=0900001680699e32|title=Letter from J.

He claimed that the circle of stars was based on the iconographic tradition of showing the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Blessed Virgin Mary]] as the [[Woman of the Apocalypse]], wearing a \"crown of twelve stars\".<ref name=\"Economist\"/><ref name=\"Gialdino\">Carlo Curti Gialdino, ''I Simboli dell'Unione europea, Bandiera - Inno - Motto - Moneta - Giornata''. Roma: Istituto Poligrafico e Zecca dello Stato S.p.A., 2005. {{ISBN|88-240-2503-X}}, pp. 80\u201385. Gialdino is here cited after a translation of the Italian text published by the ''Centre Virtuel de la Connaissance sur l'Europe'' ([http://www.cvce.eu/obj/carlo_curti_gialdino_the_symbols_of_the_european_union_origin_of_the_design_for_the_european_flag-en-df9f9dde-98a3-461b-a8a8-8f9c13012343.html cvce.eu]):\n\n\"Irrespective of the statements by Paul M. G. Levy and the recent reconstruction by Susan Hood, crediting Ars\u00e8ne Heitz with the original design still seems to me the soundest option. In particular, Ars\u00e8ne Heitz himself, in 1987, laid claim to his own role in designing the flag and to its religious inspiration when he said that 'the flag of Europe is the flag of Our Lady' [''Magnificat'' magazine, 1987].\n\n\"Secondly, it is worth noting the testimony of Father Pierre Caillon, who refers to a meeting with Ars\u00e8ne Heitz. Caillon tells of having met the former Council of Europe employee by chance in August 1987 at Lisieux in front of the Carmelite monastery. It was Heitz who stopped him and declared 'I was the one who designed the European flag. I suddenly had the idea of putting the 12 stars of the Miraculous Medal of the Rue du Bac on a blue field. My proposal was adopted unanimously on 8 December 1955, the Feast of the Immaculate Conception. I am telling you this, Father, because you are wearing the little blue cross of the Blue Army of Our Lady of Fatima'\".</ref> The French satirical magazine ''[[Le Canard encha\u00een\u00e9]]'' reacted to Heitz's statement with an article entitled ''L\u2019Europe viol\u00e9e par la Sainte Vierge'' (\"Europe Raped by the Blessed Virgin\") in the edition of 20 December 1989. Heitz also made a connection to the date of the flag's adoption, 8 December 1955, coinciding with the Catholic [[Feast of the Immaculate Conception]] of the Blessed Virgin Mary.\n\n[[Paul M. G. L\u00e9vy]], then Director of Information at the Council of Europe responsible for designing the flag, in a 1989 statement maintained that he had not been aware of any religious connotations.<ref>{{citation |title=European Union: Myths on the flag |origyear=1995 |year=2002 |publisher=[[Flags of the World]] |url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/eu!myt.html |accessdate=4 August 2007}} \"While Count Coudenhove-Kalergi in a personal statement maintained that three leading Catholics within the Council had subconsciously chosen the twelve stars on the model of Apocalypse 12:1, Paul M.G. L\u00e9vy, Press Officer of the Council from 1949 to 1966, explained in 1989 that there was no religious intention whatsoever associated with the choice of the circle of twelve stars.\" Peter Diem, 11 June 2002.</ref>\n\nIn an interview given 26 February 1998, L\u00e9vy denied not only awareness of the \"Marian\" connection, but also denied that the final design of a circle of twelve stars was Heitz's. To the question \"Who really designed the flag?\" L\u00e9vy replied:\n\n: \"I did, and I calculated the proportions to be used for the geometric design. Ars\u00e8ne Heitz, who was an employee in the mail service, put in all sorts of proposals, including the 15-star design. But he submitted too many designs. He wanted to do the European currencies with 15 stars in the corner. He wanted to do national flags incorporating the Council of Europe flag.\"<ref name=\"Gialdino\"/>\n\nCarlo Curti Gialdino (2005) has reconstructed the design process to the effect that Heitz's proposal contained varying numbers of stars, from which the version with twelve stars was chosen by the Committee of Ministers meeting at Deputy level in January 1955 as one out of two remaining candidate designs.<ref name=\"Gialdino\"/>\n\nL\u00e9vy's 1998 interview apparently gave rise to a new variant of the \"Marian\" anecdote. An article published in ''{{lang|de|[[Die Welt]]}}'' in August 1998 alleged that it was L\u00e9vy himself who was inspired to introduce a \"Marian\" element as he walked past a statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary.<ref>{{cite news |last=Pinzka |first=Thomas |url=https://www.welt.de/print-welt/article625491/Der-Sternenkranz-ist-die-Folge-eines-Geluebdes.html |title=Der Sternenkranz ist die Folge eines Gel\u00fcbdes |trans-title=The crown of stars is the result of a vote |newspaper=[[Die Welt]] |date=26 August 1998 |accessdate=3 November 2018|language=de}}</ref>\n\nAn article posted in ''La Raison'' in February 2000 further connected the donation of a stained glass window for [[Strasbourg Cathedral]] by the Council of Europe on 21 October 1956.

These first proposals were made 19th January 1950 by Paul Levy in a letter to the Secr\u00e9tarie G\u00e9neral. He proposed that the flag should contain a cross for several reasons. Firstly, the cross symbolizes roads crossing, and also represents the east, the west, the north, and the south with its arms. Furthermore, the cross appears in most of the european council members' flags, and it is the oldest and most noble symbol in Europe. Moreover, the cross depicted christianity. As far as the colours are concerned, he proposed them to be white and green, colours of the European Movement, which was of great significance since 1947. Green also depicted hope, and the green cross over a white background was a design that had not been used yet. Finally, Levy proposed that the arms of Strasbourg was an important element to be added as it represented where the Council would be, and being located in the heart of the cross meant that the Council was the point where the european roads met.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=09000016806998d8|title=Memorandum from Paul Levy to Jacques-Camille Paris (Secretary General) about having a cross on the European flag|last=|first=|date=January 19, 2020|website=Council of Europe|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nShortly after this design considerations by Paul Levy, on the 27th July 1950, Richard Coudenhove-Kalergi, president of the pan-european movement wrote a memorandum which contained some rules that a flag for such union should follow.

This boy would swim from the shore to the island each night, guided by a light she lit for him. Her father learned of the boy's visits. One night, as she waited for her lover to arrive, he smashed her light, leaving the boy in the middle of the lake without a guide to indicate which direction to swim. He drowned and his body washed ashore and, as the legend concludes, it appeared as if the words ''\"Akh, Tamara\" (Oh, Tamara)'' were frozen on his lips.<ref>{{in lang|hy}} Dzotsikian, S. M.

This boy would swim from the shore to the island each night, guided by a light she lit for him. Her father learned of the boy's visits. One night, as she waited for her lover to arrive, he smashed her light, leaving the boy in the middle of the lake without a guide to indicate which direction to swim. He drowned and his body washed ashore and, as the legend concludes, it appeared as if the words ''\"Akh, Tamara\" (Oh, Tamara)'' were frozen on his lips.<ref>{{in lang|hy}} Dzotsikian, S. M.

There will be no movement until I return to the island again\". The workers immediately stopped the demolition. We arrived at Van city center. I contacted the newspaper [[Cumhuriyet]]. They informed the Ministry of Education about the demolition. Two days later, Minister Avni Ba\u015fman telegraphed the Van governor and ordered to stop the demolition permanently.
