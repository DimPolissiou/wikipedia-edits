Freeport is known for hosting the second [[Lincoln\u2013Douglas debates|Lincoln-Douglas debate of 1858]], and as \"Pretzel City, USA\", due to a popular local German bakery known for its pretzels in the 1850s. [[Freeport High School (Illinois)|Freeport High School]]'s mascot is the Pretzel to honor this unique heritage.\n\n==History==\nThe community was originally called '''Winneshiek'''.<ref>{{cite book|author=Chicago and North Western Railway Company|title=A History of the Origin of the Place Names Connected with the Chicago & North Western and Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis & Omaha Railways|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OspBAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA74|year=1908|page=74}}</ref> When it was incorporated, the new municipality took its name from the generosity of [[Tutty Baker]], who was credited with running a \"free port\" on the [[Pecatonica River]]. The name \"Winneshiek\" was later adopted, and is preserved to this day, by the Freeport Community Theatre Group.\n\nIn 1837, Stephenson County was formed and Freeport became its seat of government in 1838. Linked by a stagecoach with [[Chicago]], the community grew rapidly. In 1840, a frame courthouse was erected and the first school was founded. Within two years, Freeport had two newspapers and in 1853, the two were joined by a third which published in German. By then, the community had a population of 2,000.\n\nOn August 27, 1858, the [[Lincoln-Douglas debates of 1858|second debate]] between [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Stephen A. Douglas]] took place in Freeport and gave the nation direction in the following years. Although Stephen Douglas won the election and retained his [[U.S. Senate]] seat, his reply to a question on slavery alienated the South, which called it the \"[[Freeport Doctrine|Freeport Heresy]]\", and split the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].<ref>Guelzom A. (2008). ''Lincoln and Douglas: The Debates that Defined America'', page 162. Simon & Schuster {{ISBN|0-7432-7320-6}}</ref> This enabled Abraham Lincoln to win the Presidency in 1860.\n\nA monument to the debate was dedicated in 1903 by President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and stands at this site. A life size statue recreating the event was dedicated in 1992. Another renowned statue, ''Lincoln the Debator'' by [[Leonard Crunelle]], is a focal point in the city's Taylor Park. In many years there is also a reenactment of the debate, [[The Lincoln-Douglas Debates (1994 reenactments)|which has been shown]] on [[C-SPAN]].\n\nFreeport is known as the \"Pretzel City\", and its public high school's team is named the Pretzels.  The nickname is a reminder of Freeport's ethnic heritage; in the late 1850s, many [[German-American|Germans]], both from Pennsylvania and from their European homeland, resettled in Stephenson County bringing with them their love of pretzel snacks.<ref>http://www.illinois.com/details/city.php?cityFips=1727884  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930074752/http://www.illinois.com/details/city.php?cityFips=1727884 |date=September 30, 2011 }}</ref> In 1869, a German immigrant named John Billerbeck<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.genealogieonline.nl/en/stamboom-familie-eilders-is-samengesteld-door-b.-eilders/I96781.php|title=John Billerbeck (1835-1899) \u00bb Stamboom familie Eilders \u00bb Genealogie Online|author=B.

Freeport is known for hosting the second [[Lincoln\u2013Douglas debates|Lincoln-Douglas debate of 1858]], and as \"Pretzel City, USA\", due to a popular local German bakery known for its pretzels in the 1850s. [[Freeport High School (Illinois)|Freeport High School]]'s mascot is the Pretzel to honor this unique heritage.\n\n==History==\nThe community was originally called '''Winneshiek'''.<ref>{{cite book|author=Chicago and North Western Railway Company|title=A History of the Origin of the Place Names Connected with the Chicago & North Western and Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis & Omaha Railways|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OspBAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA74|year=1908|page=74}}</ref> When it was incorporated, the new municipality took its name from the generosity of [[Tutty Baker]], who was credited with running a \"free port\" on the [[Pecatonica River]]. The name \"Winneshiek\" was later adopted, and is preserved to this day, by the Freeport Community Theatre Group.\n\nIn 1837, Stephenson County was formed and Freeport became its seat of government in 1838. Linked by a stagecoach with [[Chicago]], the community grew rapidly. In 1840, a frame courthouse was erected and the first school was founded. Within two years, Freeport had two newspapers and in 1853, the two were joined by a third which published in German. By then, the community had a population of 2,000.\n\nOn August 27, 1858, the [[Lincoln-Douglas debates of 1858|second debate]] between [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Stephen A. Douglas]] took place in Freeport and gave the nation direction in the following years. Although Stephen Douglas won the election and retained his [[U.S. Senate]] seat, his reply to a question on slavery alienated the South, which called it the \"[[Freeport Doctrine|Freeport Heresy]]\", and split the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].<ref>Guelzom A. (2008). ''Lincoln and Douglas: The Debates that Defined America'', page 162. Simon & Schuster {{ISBN|0-7432-7320-6}}</ref> This enabled Abraham Lincoln to win the Presidency in 1860.\n\nA monument to the debate was dedicated in 1903 by President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and stands at this site. A life size statue recreating the event was dedicated in 1992. Another renowned statue, ''Lincoln the Debator'' by [[Leonard Crunelle]], is a focal point in the city's Taylor Park. In many years there is also a reenactment of the debate, [[The Lincoln-Douglas Debates (1994 reenactments)|which has been shown]] on [[C-SPAN]].\n\nFreeport is known as the \"Pretzel City\", and its public high school's team is named the Pretzels.  The nickname is a reminder of Freeport's ethnic heritage; in the late 1850s, many [[German-American|Germans]], both from Pennsylvania and from their European homeland, resettled in Stephenson County bringing with them their love of pretzel snacks.<ref>http://www.illinois.com/details/city.php?cityFips=1727884  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930074752/http://www.illinois.com/details/city.php?cityFips=1727884 |date=September 30, 2011 }}</ref> In 1869, a German immigrant named John Billerbeck<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.genealogieonline.nl/en/stamboom-familie-eilders-is-samengesteld-door-b.-eilders/I96781.php|title=John Billerbeck (1835-1899) \u00bb Stamboom familie Eilders \u00bb Genealogie Online|author=B.

After middle school, Stiles began her high school career at [[Coe-Brown Northwood Academy]] in New Hampshire.\n\n==Career==\nAt the age of twelve, Stiles started getting involved with theater productions in [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]]. Her first role was when she played the titular character in ''[[Annie (musical)|Annie]]'' at the Seacoast Repertory Theater. As a teenager, Stiles played two other major roles while living in New Hampshire: [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]] in ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1987 musical)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', and [[Cinderella]] in ''[[Cinderella (musical)|Cinderella]]''. Stiles loved the performing arts so much that she spent her summers working at the [[Prescott Park (New Hampshire)|Prescott Park]] Arts Festival in Portsmouth.\n\nBefore she got involved with Broadway productions, she trained at the [[American Musical and Dramatic Academy]] in New York City. Stiles is known for her two roles in the Off-Broadway production ''Avenue Q'', which is the story of a college student who moves to New York City with big dreams but lives on Avenue Q and has very little money. Stiles plays Kate Monster and Lucy the Slut, who are two [[puppet]]s that she controls throughout the show. \n\nAfter Stiles spent much of her time in the production of ''Avenue Q'', she later was offered the role of Joanne in ''Vanities'', a project that Stiles had been involved with for a period of two years. ''Vanities'' was located at the [[Pasadena Playhouse]] in [[Pasadena, California]], but eventually was moved to [[Second Stage Theatre|Second Stage]] in New York. This role in ''Vanities'' eventually led Stiles to be involved in recording an album for the songs.\n\nShe played the role of [[Little Red Riding Hood]] in [[Stephen Sondheim]] and [[James Lapine]]'s musical ''[[Into the Woods]]'' at the [[Delacorte Theater]] in New York as part of [[Shakespeare in the Park]]. She stars opposite [[Academy Award]] nominee [[Amy Adams]] and [[Tony Award]] winners [[Donna Murphy]] and [[Denis O'Hare]].\n\nIn 2017, Stiles appeared in the [[Epix]] television series ''[[Get Shorty (TV series)|Get Shorty]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2016/11/get-shorty-sarah-stiles-cast-epix-series-ray-romano-chris-odowd-1201850420/ |title=\u2018Get Shorty\u2019: Sarah Stiles Joins Cast Of Epix Series |last=Petski |first=Denise |date=November 7, 2016 |work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]  |access-date=May 16, 2017 }}</ref> Stiles appeared in the 2018 film ''[[Unsane (film)|Unsane]]''.\n\nShe appeared in the [[Tootsie (musical)|stage musical]] version of the film ''[[Tootsie]]'' beginning in September 2018, which premiered in Chicago at the Cadillac Palace Theatre from September 11 to October 14, 2018. The musical opened on Broadway in April 2019. In the third season of the Epix television series ''Get Shorty'' Stiles character Gladys, a singer/actress, is cast in the Broadway musical ''Tootsie'' playing the character Stiles actually played in the musical. This plot development allowed Stiles to recreate one of her numbers from the Broadway show on the TV series.\n\nIn 2019, Stiles voiced the character of Spinel, the main antagonist from the [[Cartoon Network]] television film ''[[Steven Universe: The Movie]]'', based on the series ''[[Steven Universe]]''. The performance received high critisizim from audiences and critics and extreme hatred from internet viewers.\n\n==Discography==\nAlong with having performed on many different stages in various off-Broadway shows, Stiles has found the time to be involved in three different albums for three plays. Her first album recording was singing for the role of Joanne, for the musical, ''Vanities the Musical''. Her second album recording was when she sang the character Nazirah for the musical, ''The Road to Qatar''. Most recently, she can be heard on the album for the musical adaptation of Roald Dahl's ''James and the Giant Peach'' as the Spider. Aside from album recordings, Stiles and her friend Howie have been working on their sketches for their comedy channel on YouTube. The YouTube channel is called Sillyocity, and together, the two of them combine their ideas to make short comedic [[webisode]]s.\n\n==Theatre credits==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Year\n!

After middle school, Stiles began her high school career at [[Coe-Brown Northwood Academy]] in New Hampshire.\n\n==Career==\nAt the age of twelve, Stiles started getting involved with theater productions in [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]]. Her first role was when she played the titular character in ''[[Annie (musical)|Annie]]'' at the Seacoast Repertory Theater. As a teenager, Stiles played two other major roles while living in New Hampshire: [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]] in ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1987 musical)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', and [[Cinderella]] in ''[[Cinderella (musical)|Cinderella]]''. Stiles loved the performing arts so much that she spent her summers working at the [[Prescott Park (New Hampshire)|Prescott Park]] Arts Festival in Portsmouth.\n\nBefore she got involved with Broadway productions, she trained at the [[American Musical and Dramatic Academy]] in New York City. Stiles is known for her two roles in the Off-Broadway production ''Avenue Q'', which is the story of a college student who moves to New York City with big dreams but lives on Avenue Q and has very little money. Stiles plays Kate Monster and Lucy the Slut, who are two [[puppet]]s that she controls throughout the show. \n\nAfter Stiles spent much of her time in the production of ''Avenue Q'', she later was offered the role of Joanne in ''Vanities'', a project that Stiles had been involved with for a period of two years. ''Vanities'' was located at the [[Pasadena Playhouse]] in [[Pasadena, California]], but eventually was moved to [[Second Stage Theatre|Second Stage]] in New York. This role in ''Vanities'' eventually led Stiles to be involved in recording an album for the songs.\n\nShe played the role of [[Little Red Riding Hood]] in [[Stephen Sondheim]] and [[James Lapine]]'s musical ''[[Into the Woods]]'' at the [[Delacorte Theater]] in New York as part of [[Shakespeare in the Park]]. She stars opposite [[Academy Award]] nominee [[Amy Adams]] and [[Tony Award]] winners [[Donna Murphy]] and [[Denis O'Hare]].\n\nIn 2017, Stiles appeared in the [[Epix]] television series ''[[Get Shorty (TV series)|Get Shorty]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2016/11/get-shorty-sarah-stiles-cast-epix-series-ray-romano-chris-odowd-1201850420/ |title=\u2018Get Shorty\u2019: Sarah Stiles Joins Cast Of Epix Series |last=Petski |first=Denise |date=November 7, 2016 |work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]  |access-date=May 16, 2017 }}</ref> Stiles appeared in the 2018 film ''[[Unsane (film)|Unsane]]''.\n\nShe appeared in the [[Tootsie (musical)|stage musical]] version of the film ''[[Tootsie]]'' beginning in September 2018, which premiered in Chicago at the Cadillac Palace Theatre from September 11 to October 14, 2018. The musical opened on Broadway in April 2019. In the third season of the Epix television series ''Get Shorty'' Stiles character Gladys, a singer/actress, is cast in the Broadway musical ''Tootsie'' playing the character Stiles actually played in the musical. This plot development allowed Stiles to recreate one of her numbers from the Broadway show on the TV series.\n\nIn 2019, Stiles voiced the character of Spinel, the main antagonist from the [[Cartoon Network]] television film ''[[Steven Universe: The Movie]]'', based on the series ''[[Steven Universe]]''. The performance received high praise from audiences and critics.\n\n==Discography==\nAlong with having performed on many different stages in various off-Broadway shows, Stiles has found the time to be involved in three different albums for three plays. Her first album recording was singing for the role of Joanne, for the musical, ''Vanities the Musical''. Her second album recording was when she sang the character Nazirah for the musical, ''The Road to Qatar''. Most recently, she can be heard on the album for the musical adaptation of Roald Dahl's ''James and the Giant Peach'' as the Spider. Aside from album recordings, Stiles and her friend Howie have been working on their sketches for their comedy channel on YouTube. The YouTube channel is called Sillyocity, and together, the two of them combine their ideas to make short comedic [[webisode]]s.\n\n==Theatre credits==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Year\n!
