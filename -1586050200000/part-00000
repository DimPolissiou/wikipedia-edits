StarMetro operates both fixed-route and dial-a-ride service in the Tallahassee metropolitan area.\n\n== History ==\nFixed-Route Service began when the City of [[Tallahassee, Florida|Tallahassee]] purchased the public transit system from Cities Transit Company and renamed it \u201cTaltran.\u201d In 1984, the city began offering Dial-A-Ride service. Construction of C.K. Steele Plaza ended in 1986. TalTran changed its name to StarMetro in 2005 during a \"Renaissance\", which included new buses and improved stops. StarMetro received federal grants in both 2011 and 2017 to purchase battery-electric buses.\n\n==Routes==\nStarMetro operates every day of the year except for [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] and [[Christmas]] Day. Weekday service consists of 15 regularly scheduled fixed-routes, two flex-routes, and one express route that operates during peak travel times. The \"Saturday\" schedule consists of 12 of the weekday routes, typically with the earliest trip eliminated and/or the headway reduced. The \"Sunday\" schedule consists of a completely separate system of four routes that is not as extensive as the weekday/Saturday routes. This Sunday route system is also run on weekday and Saturday nights (7:00 P.M. to 10:00 P.M.). All weekday and Saturday routes are named for Tallahassee area locations and symbols while the Sunday routes are numbered. Additionally, Monday-Friday from 11:30 A. M. to 2:50 P. M. (last stop) & on Friday and Saturday evenings from 4:30 P. M. to 1:00 A. M. (last stop), StarMetro operates The \"Lunch/Dinner Trolley\" route, which offers free service to various entertainment locations in the Gaines Street (College Town), Downtown, Cascades Park and Midtown areas, serving each stop approximately every 20 minutes (\"Lunch Trolley\") & 30 minutes (\"Dinner Trolley\"). During \"[[Celebrate America]]\" on [[July 4th]] (Unofficially Route J4), StarMetro offers a special opportunity to view The Annual Fireworks at Tom Brown Park. So Park your car and enjoy a free bus ride to the event! Busses leave from The New Koger Center on Capital Cir. SE starting at 5:00 P. M., and continue operating approximately every 15 minutes until the last shuttle @ 8:30 P. M.  After the Fireworks have concluded, or 10:00 P. M., return service will commence with the last shuttle leaving Tom Brown Park @ 11:00 P. M.  [[ Starting March 19, 2020, due to COVID-19]], [[all weekday bus service will end @ 8 P. M., Normal operating hours on Saturday & Sunday, Park Route, Night & Trolley service, will be temporarily suspended, bus capacity will be limited to 15 passengers, until further notice.]]\n\n===Weekday Routes===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

StarMetro has been providing campus transportation to FSU since 1973.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.talgov.com/|title=The City of Tallahassee|website=www.talgov.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-22}}</ref> The FSU Nite Nole route operates Monday through Saturday nights. These routes are free to the public and connect campus with nearby student housing facilities. In Fall 2019, FSU signed a 10 year contract with StarMetro to continue providing campus bus services. As part of the new contract, StarMetro began purchasing all electric buses to run exclusively on FSU campus routes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.fsu.edu/news/2019/02/14/fsu-electric-buses/|title=Florida State becoming a driving force in electric-vehicle technology|date=2019-02-14|website=Florida State University News|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-23}}</ref> Each [[Proterra, Inc.|Proterra]] Catalyst FC bus costs approximately $719,000 with a battery lease.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.talgov.com/transparency/budget-fy19.aspx|title=FY19 Approved Budget|last=|first=|date=|website=City of Tallahassee|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The first campus route to go fully electric was the Heritage Route. Beginning in 2020, campus bus routes and times have been altered in order to prepare for the full roll out of electric buses across all routes. FSU is installing two overhead charging stations at their [[Doak Campbell Stadium]] bus stop and at Stadium Drive and Spirit Way. Currently, the university pays StarMetro a fee of $91.45/bus/hour to operate campus routes.  \n\nStarMetro used to also provide fixed routes on the [[Florida A&M University]] campus, but this was discontinued when the institution decided not to renew its contract with the agency and began providing campus shuttle services in-house <ref>https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/2016/06/30/famu-inks-starmetro-deal/86561198/</ref>.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+FSU Campus Routes <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.talgov.com/|title=The City of Tallahassee|website=www.talgov.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.talgov.com/|title=The City of Tallahassee|website=www.talgov.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-23}}</ref>\n!Route Abbreviation\n!Route Name\n!Destinations\n!Fall & Spring Term Operation Times\n|-\n|GA\n|Garnet\n|Ocala St (Northbound), High Road (Southbound), Ocala Corners Shopping, W Call Street, FSU First Circle, FSU Second Circle, Student Union (Eastbound), Jefferson Street (Westbound)\n|7:00am-7:51pm\nMon.-Fri.\n|-\n|GO\n|Gold\n|Ocala St (Southbound), High Road (Northbound), W Call Street, FSU First Circle, FSU Second Circle, Student Union (Westbound), Jefferson Street (Eastbound)\n|7:10am-7:57pm\n\nMon-Fri\n|-\n|HE\n|Heritage\n|C.K.

Steele Plaza ===\nStarMetro's main station is C.K. Steele Plaza (\"the plaza), which was named for the Reverend [[Charles Kenzie Steele]]. It is located at 111 West Tennessee Street in downtown Tallahassee on the block bordered by Tennessee Street, Adams Street, Call Street, and Duval Street. The plaza features 24 covered gates for passenger boarding and alighting. Amenities at the plaza include restrooms, covered seating areas, bus driver lounge, and a customer service booth. Fourteen out of the 15 regularly scheduled weekday routes (Azalea, Big Bend, Dogwood, Evergreen, Forest, Gulf, Hartsfield, Killearn, Moss, Park, Red Hills, San Luis, Tall Timbers and Southwood Express) stop at the plaza, in addition to The Heritage Route serving Florida State University Campus, making it the single busiest stop in the system. In addition to StarMetro busses, Steele Plaza serves as the eastern terminus of the Gadsden Express route, which connects the residents of [[Quincy, Florida|Quincy]] and [[Midway, Gadsden County, Florida|Midway]] to Tallahassee.  The new [[Havana]] [[Express bus service|Express]] connects with Big Bend & Forest Routes at Lake Jackson.\n\nPlans to renovate the plaza and turn it into a mixed-use facility to include bus bays, StarMetro office space, and even leasable office space have been proposed. However, funding has not yet been procured. \n\n=== Headquarters ===\nThe headquarters for StarMetro are located at 555 Appleyard Drive at the corner of Appleyard and Jackson Bluff Road. Only two routes pass this facility (Forest and Live Oak). Located on this property are administrative offices, a bus maintenance facility, bus parking lot, call center, and customer service window. StarMetro is planning to relocate their bus storage and maintenance facility to a larger plot of land to accommodate for their growing fleet. \n\n=== Bus Stops ===\nBus stops are referred to as Star Stops, and they are denoted by a rectangular blue sign featuring a white star, route in appropriate color that serves particular location & days of operation. Stops served exclusively by FSU Campus Routes have a different sign with the Seminole Express logo and FSU colors. Many stops have no amenities, while the busier stops and transfer points have various amenities including benches, waste containers, and/or covered shelters.\n\n=== Super-Stops ===\nStarMetro plans to construct a series of \"Super Stops\" that will serve as transfer points in places where three or more routes currently or potentially intersect. These stops will be on a smaller scale of C.K. Steele Plaza and will feature covered walkways, benches, restrooms, and vending machines. StarMetro has plans to build three Super Stops on South Adams Street, North Monroe Street, and Hartsfield Road (near Mission Road). Each Super Stop is estimated to cost $3 million to construct. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cms.leoncountyfl.gov/Portals/0/admin/Sales%20Tax%20Committee/Projects/2013/Project%2029%20StarMetro%20-%20Enhanced%20Infrastructure.pdf|title=StarMetro Proposed Infrastructure Sales Tax Report|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nA temporary park, costing $300,000 is being constructed at the future South Side Super Stop on the corner of Orange and Meridian Roads.

One planned change is the addition of two new transfer stops. These stops will make it possible to travel across Tallahassee without changing buses at the downtown hub station. In addition, StarMetro is planning [[Wireless LAN|wireless internet]] and television in buses, GPS-enabled buses with live location maps over the [[Internet]], solar-lighted stops with live location maps, and blinking lights at stops to let drivers know of waiting passengers. The C.K. Steele station includes renovation and installation of information [[Kiosk|kiosks]]. Seats on the newer-model buses are made of padded plastic and are arranged front-facing in rows and sideways against the walls, much like a [[Rapid transit|subway]] car layout. All models in use except the [[Dial-A-Ride]] shuttle vans exceed 4000 pounds, and therefore are not equipped with [[Seat belt|seat belts]]. All buses are equipped with climate-control and interior lighting.\n\nStarMetro implemented a complete route overhaul dubbed \"Nova2010\" in 2010, which reduced the current system to 11 routes, of which only 4 are intended meet at CK Steele Plaza. The routes now run at closer intervals than before, while providing transfer points all over the city \u2014 no longer requiring all two-bus trips to transfer at CK Steele Plaza. Some trips may now require two transfers, but will still generally result in a more direct and faster trip than transferring at the Plaza.\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox Bus transit\n| name            = \n| logo            = StarMetro Logo.png\n| logo_size       = 250\n| image_size      = \n| image_caption   = \n| company_slogan  = Smart City.

StarMetro operates both fixed-route and dial-a-ride service in the Tallahassee metropolitan area.\n\n== History ==\nFixed-Route Service began when the City of [[Tallahassee, Florida|Tallahassee]] purchased the public transit system from Cities Transit Company and renamed it \u201cTaltran.\u201d In 1984, the city began offering Dial-A-Ride service. Construction of C.K. Steele Plaza ended in 1986. TalTran changed its name to StarMetro in 2005 during a \"Renaissance\", which included new buses and improved stops. StarMetro received federal grants in both 2011 and 2017 to purchase battery-electric buses.\n\n==Routes==\nStarMetro operates every day of the year except for [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] and [[Christmas]] Day. Weekday service consists of 15 regularly scheduled fixed-routes, two flex-routes, and one express route that operates during peak travel times. The \"Saturday\" schedule consists of 12 of the weekday routes, typically with the earliest trip eliminated and/or the headway reduced. The \"Sunday\" schedule consists of a completely separate system of four routes that is not as extensive as the weekday/Saturday routes. This Sunday route system is also run on weekday and Saturday nights (7:00 P.M. to 10:00 P.M.). All weekday and Saturday routes are named for Tallahassee area locations and symbols while the Sunday routes are numbered. Additionally, Monday-Friday from 11:30 A. M. to 2:50 P. M. (last stop) & on Friday and Saturday evenings from 4:30 P. M. to 1:00 A. M. (last stop), StarMetro operates The \"Lunch/Dinner Trolley\" route, which offers free service to various entertainment locations in the Gaines Street (College Town), Downtown, Cascades Park and Midtown areas, serving each stop approximately every 20 minutes (\"Lunch Trolley\") & 30 minutes (\"Dinner Trolley\"). During \"[[Celebrate America]]\" on [[July 4th]] (Unofficially Route J4), StarMetro offers a special opportunity to view The Annual Fireworks at Tom Brown Park. So Park your car and enjoy a free bus ride to the event! Busses leave from The New Koger Center on Capital Cir. SE starting at 5:00 P. M., and continue operating approximately every 15 minutes until the last shuttle @ 8:30 P. M.  After the Fireworks have concluded, or 10:00 P. M., return service will commence with the last shuttle leaving Tom Brown Park @ 11:00 P. M.  [[ Starting March 19, 2020, due to COVID-19]], [[all weekday bus service will end @ 8 P. M., Park Route, Night & Trolley service, will be temporarily suspended, bus capacity will be limited to 15 passengers, until further notice.]]\n\n===Weekday Routes===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

These routes are free to the public and connect campus with nearby student housing facilities. In Fall 2019, FSU signed a 10 year contract with StarMetro to continue providing campus bus services.

Children under 12 ride for free.\n*'''Bus charters''' are available with StarMetro.\n*'''Community Transportation Coordinator.''' Transportation services for citizens throughout Leon County are available. Riders must qualify through [[Medicaid]], Developmental Disabilities or the Transportation Disadvantaged program for transportation. This is door-to-door service with fares charged based on the sponsoring program.\n*'''Digital Bus Pass''' allows riders to purchase and use bus passes using the Token Transit App.\n\n==Fares==\nThe regular, one-trip fare is $1.25 and the reduced one-trip fare is $0.60. The reduced fare is available for seniors, children, disabled persons and people on [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]]. Passengers who purchase a one-trip fare may request a transfer ticket from the driver, which are free; those are valid for up to two transfers within 90 minutes of the ticket being issued; round-trips & stopovers are prohibited. Kids below 6 ride for free with fare-paying rider; limit 3.\n\nStarMetro offers three unlimited ride pass options: rolling 24 hours of unlimited rides for $3, rolling weekly unlimited for $10, and a rolling 31-day unlimited pass for $38.\n\n==Facilities and Infrastructure==\n\n=== C.K. Steele Plaza ===\nStarMetro's main station is C.K. Steele Plaza (\"the plaza), which was named for the Reverend [[Charles Kenzie Steele]]. It is located at 111 West Tennessee Street in downtown Tallahassee on the block bordered by Tennessee Street, Adams Street, Call Street, and Duval Street. The plaza features 24 covered gates for passenger boarding and alighting. Amenities at the plaza include restrooms, covered seating areas, bus driver lounge, and a customer service booth. Fourteen out of the 15 regularly scheduled weekday routes (Azalea, Big Bend, Dogwood, Evergreen, Forest, Gulf, Hartsfield, Killearn, Moss, Park, Red Hills, San Luis, Tall Timbers and Southwood Express) stop at the plaza, in addition to The Heritage Route serving Florida State University Campus, making it the single busiest stop in the system. In addition to StarMetro busses, Steele Plaza serves as the eastern terminus of the Gadsden Express route, which connects the residents of [[Quincy, Florida|Quincy]] and [[Midway, Gadsden County, Florida|Midway]] to Tallahassee.  The new [[Havana]] [[Express bus service|Express]] connects with Big Bend & Forest Routes at Lake Jackson.\n\nPlans to renovate the plaza and turn it into a mixed-use facility to include bus bays, StarMetro office space, and even leasable office space have been proposed. However, funding has not yet been procured. \n\n=== Headquarters ===\nThe headquarters for StarMetro are located at 555 Appleyard Drive at the corner of Appleyard and Jackson Bluff Road. Only two routes pass this facility (Forest and Live Oak). Located on this property are administrative offices, a bus maintenance facility, bus parking lot, call center, and customer service window. StarMetro is planning to relocate their bus storage and maintenance facility to a larger plot of land to accommodate for their growing fleet. \n\n=== Bus Stops ===\nBus stops are referred to as Star Stops, and they are denoted by a rectangular blue sign featuring a white star, route in appropriate color that serves particular location & days of operation. Stops served exclusively by FSU Campus Routes have a different sign with the Seminole Express logo and FSU colors. Many stops have no amenities, while the busier stops and transfer points have various amenities including benches, waste containers, and/or covered shelters.\n\n=== Super-Stops ===\nStarMetro plans to construct a series of \"Super Stops\" that will serve as transfer points in places where three or more routes currently or potentially intersect. These stops will be on a smaller scale of C.K. Steele Plaza and will feature covered walkways, benches, restrooms, and vending machines. StarMetro has plans to build three Super Stops on South Adams Street, North Monroe Street, and Hartsfield Road (near Mission Road). Each Super Stop is estimated to cost $3 million to construct. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cms.leoncountyfl.gov/Portals/0/admin/Sales%20Tax%20Committee/Projects/2013/Project%2029%20StarMetro%20-%20Enhanced%20Infrastructure.pdf|title=StarMetro Proposed Infrastructure Sales Tax Report|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nA temporary park, costing $300,000 is being constructed at the future South Side Super Stop on the corner of Orange and Meridian Roads.

One planned change is the addition of two new transfer stops. These stops will make it possible to travel across Tallahassee without changing buses at the downtown hub station. In addition, StarMetro is planning [[Wireless LAN|wireless internet]] and television in buses, GPS-enabled buses with live location maps over the [[Internet]], solar-lighted stops with live location maps, and blinking lights at stops to let drivers know of waiting passengers. The C.K. Steele station includes renovation and installation of information [[Kiosk|kiosks]]. Seats on the newer-model buses are made of padded plastic and are arranged front-facing in rows and sideways against the walls, much like a [[Rapid transit|subway]] car layout. All models in use except the [[Dial-A-Ride]] shuttle vans exceed 4000 pounds, and therefore are not equipped with [[Seat belt|seat belts]]. All buses are equipped with climate-control and interior lighting.\n\nStarMetro implemented a complete route overhaul dubbed \"Nova2010\" in 2010, which reduced the current system to 11 routes, of which only 4 are intended meet at CK Steele Plaza. The routes now run at closer intervals than before, while providing transfer points all over the city \u2014 no longer requiring all two-bus trips to transfer at CK Steele Plaza. Some trips may now require two transfers, but will still generally result in a more direct and faster trip than transferring at the Plaza.\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n", "name_user": "TransportWiz", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eRoutes:Added Weekend operating hours due to COVID-19.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StarMetro_(bus_service)"}

Most nuts come from the [[carpel|pistils]] with ''inferior'' ovaries (see [[flower]]) and all are ''indehiscent'' (not opening at maturity). True nuts are produced, for example, by some plant families of the [[order (biology)|order]] [[Fagales]].\n\n;Order Fagales (not all species produce true nuts)\n* Family [[Fagaceae]]\n** [[Beech]] (''Fagus'')\n** [[Chestnut]] (''Castanea'')\n** [[Oak]] (''Quercus'')\n** [[Lithocarpus|Stone-oak]] (''Lithocarpus'')\n** [[Tanoak]] (''Notholithocarpus'')\n* Family [[Betulaceae]]\n** [[Hazel]], [[Corylus maxima|Filbert]] (''Corylus'')\n** [[Hornbeam]] (''Carpinus'')\n\nA small nut may be called a \"nutlet\" (or nucule, a term otherwise referring to the oogonium of [[Charales|stoneworts]]). In [[botany]], the term \"nutlet\" specifically refers to a [[pyrena]] or pyrene, which is a [[seed]] covered by a stony layer, such as the kernel of a [[drupe]].  Walnuts and [[hickory|hickories]] ([[Juglandaceae]]) have fruits that are difficult to classify. They are considered to be nuts under some definitions but are also referred to as drupaceous nuts. \"Tryma\" is a specialized term for hickory fruits.\n\nIn common use, a \"tree nut\" is, as the name implies, any nut coming from a [[tree]]. This most often comes up regarding [[Food allergy|food allergies]], a person may be allergic specifically to peanuts (which are not tree nuts but [[legumes]]), whereas others may be allergic to the wider range of nuts that grow in trees.\n\n== Culinary definition and uses ==\n\n{{Main|Nut (food)}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Food}}\n* [[List of culinary nuts]]\n* [[List of edible seeds]]\n* [[List of foods]]\n* [[Nutmeg]]\n* [[Achene]]\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{reflist}}\n\n'''Further reading'''\n*Albala, Ken (2014) ''Nuts A Global History''.

Most nuts come from the [[carpel|pistils]] with ''inferior'' ovaries (see [[flower]]) and all are ''indehiscent'' (not opening at maturity). True nuts are produced, for example, by some plant families of the [[order (biology)|order]] [[Fagales]].\n\n;Order Fagales (not all species produce true nuts)\n* Family [[Fagaceae]]\n** [[Beech]] (''Fagus'')\n** [[Chestnut]] (''Castanea'')\n** [[Oak]] (''Quercus'')\n** [[Lithocarpus|Stone-oak]] (''Lithocarpus'')\n** [[Tanoak]] (''Notholithocarpus'')\n* Family [[Betulaceae]]\n** [[Hazel]], [[Corylus maxima|Filbert]] (''Corylus'')\n** [[Hornbeam]] (''Carpinus'')\n\nA small nut may be called a \"nutlet\" (or nucule, a term otherwise referring to the oogonium of [[Charales|stoneworts]]). In [[botany]], the term \"nutlet\" specifically refers to a [[pyrena]] or pyrene, which is a [[seed]] covered by a stony layer, such as the kernel of a [[drupe]].  Walnuts and [[hickory|hickories]] ([[Juglandaceae]]) have fruits that are difficult to classify. They are considered to be nuts under some definitions but are also referred to as drupaceous nuts. \"Tryma\" is a specialized term for hickory fruits.\n\nIn common use, a \"tree nut\" is, as the name implies, any nut coming from a [[tree]]. This most often comes up regarding [[Food allergy|food allergies]], a person may be allergic specifically to peanuts (which are not tree nuts but [[legumes]]), whereas others may be allergic to the wider range of nuts that grow in trees.\n\n== Culinary definition and uses ==\n\n{{Main|Nut (food)}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Food}}\n* [[List of culinary nuts]]\n* [[List of edible seeds]]\n* [[List of foods]]\n* [[Nutmeg]]\n* [[Achene]]\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{reflist}}\n\n'''Further reading'''\n*Albala, Ken (2014) ''Nuts A Global History''.

With its founding in 2005, there were 20 collections in the Music Library.<ref>De Jongh, 'Armed with a Light Bulb', 212.</ref> These included the literary estate of internationally celebrated composer and conductor [[Albert Coates (musician)|Albert Coates]] and the music library of bibliophile Michael Scott.<ref>Barry Ross, 'Maestro and Commander: The Michael Scott Collection at the University of Stellenbosch', ''Fontes Artis Musicae'' 54:3 (July\u2013September 2007), 331-258.</ref> At the end of its first decade, the number of collections had grown to 70, including the documentary collections of important South African composers, performing artists, musicologists and music institutions. Significantly, these acquisitions had broadened the diversity of music held in the archive and studied by music researchers and students. Whereas previously the special collections of the Music Library had held only Western art music materials (complimenting the focus on such music in the Music Department),<ref>Izak J. Grov\u00e9 (ed.), ''Konservatorium 1905-2005'' (Stellenbosch: African Sun Media, 2005).</ref> DOMUS acquired popular music archives (among others the archives of [[Anton Goosen]] and [[Taliep Petersen]], substantial materials on boeremusiek and musicians like [[Nico Carstens]], the archives of record companies like [[Mountain Records]] and extensive archival collections documenting unwritten histories of South African music, like [[David Marks]]'s [https://aoinstitute.ac.za/hidden-years/ Hidden Years Music Archive]), as well as archives relating to different media in which music played an important role (for example the archive of filmmaker, artist and writer [[Aryan Kaganof]]). DOMUS also continued to acquire the archives of important Western art music composers, like [[Graham Newcater]], [[John Simon (composer)|John Simon]], [[Stefans Grov\u00e9]], [[Hubert du Plessis]], Christopher Langford James and [[Michael Blake (composer)|Michael Blake]].\n\nSix of the collections in DOMUS are available as digitized collections on open access at https://digital.lib.sun.ac.za/handle/10019.2/1773. These include the collections of Albert Coates (630 items), Christopher James (30 items), Graham Newcater (7 items), John Simon (15 items), South African Jewish Music articles (4964 articles) and Stefans Grov\u00e9 (120 articles).\n\n==DOMUS projects between 2005 and 2016==\n\nDuring this period, Muller funded numerous research-related projects under the aegis of DOMUS. These included: Seminars hosting musicologists Marie Jorritsma and [http://barbaratitus.nl/en/home-eng/ Barbara Titus] (2008); a series of conversations and recordings of the isiXhosa bow player [[Madosini]] (Latozi Mpahleni) with composer [http://huyssen.de Hans Huyssen] (2009); analysis workshops with composer [[Hannes Taljaard]] (2009); a simposium to celebrate [[Kevin Volans]]'s sixtieth birthday (2009) with contributions by pianist [http://www.jillrichards.com Jill Richards], musicologist Christine Lucia, and philosopher Jean-Pierre de la Parte, a performance of [[Zim Ngqawana]] and Kyle Shepherd in a scrap yard in Stellenbosch to showcase Aryan Kaganof's film ''An Exhibition of Vandalizim'' (2010); lectures by [https://www.ram.ac.uk/about-us/staff/raymond-holden Raymond Holden] on 'The Modern Orchestra' (2010); a piano recital by pianist [https://www.ram.ac.uk/about-us/staff/daniel-ben-pienaar Daniel-Ben Pienaar] as part of the joint IMS/SASRIM conference at Stellenbosch University (2010); round table discussions The State of the Discipline (chaired by [https://music.ukzn.ac.za/staff-profile/honorary-academic-staff/christopher-ballantine Christopher Ballantine]) and Music and Exile (chaired by Jean-Pierre de la Porte) at the IMS/SASRIM conference in Stellenbosch (2010), lecture series by Jean-Pierre de la Porte entitled 'New Horizons in Composition and Research' (2010); a screening of [[Aryan Kaganof]]'s and [[Dylan Valley]]'s film ''The Uprising of Hangberg'' in Kayamandi in Stellenbosch and a recording of [[Hangberg]] reggae band, ''Blaze'', at [https://milestones.co.za Milestone Studio]'s in Cape Town (2010).\n\n==DOMUS after 2016==\n\nBefore its formal establishment as a Special Collection in the Stellenbosch University Library and Information Service in 2016, under the headship of Muller DOMUS functioned as both a music heritage preservation and a research initiative. After the creation of [http://aoinstitute.ac.za Africa Open Institute] (AOI) in 2016, DOMUS adopted a more conventional archival orientation in its focus on collecting, conserving/preserving, sorting and cataloguing music collections. The archive retains close links with the music research environment at Stellenbosch University, with the Senior Director of Library and Information Services serving in an ex officio capacity on the Board of AOI, and the Collections Acquisitions Committee of DOMUS retaining representation by AOI. Since 2016, AOI has continued to fund and actively mediate in the acquisition of new archives for DOMUS, including the Werner Nel papers (2019), the John Roos/Hennie Joubert archive (2019), the Rupert Mayr papers (2019) and the Pam Devereux Harris archive (2019). The Africa Open Institute has also continued to fund digitization projects in DOMUS through its 'Delinking Encounters' archive project (2016-2020), funded by the Andrew W.
