{"title_page": "Structural unemployment", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=March 2010}}\n'''Structural unemployment''' is a form of [[involuntary unemployment]] caused by a mismatch between the skills that workers in the economy can offer, and the skills demanded of workers by employers (also known as the '''skills gap''').  Structural unemployment is often brought about by [[technological change]]s that make the job skills of many workers obsolete. \n\nStructural unemployment is one of three categories of unemployment distinguished by [[economics|economists]], the others being [[frictional unemployment]] and [[cyclical unemployment]].\n\nBecause it requires either migration or re-training, structural unemployment can be long-term and slow to fix.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE5955NE20091006 | work=Reuters | title=Structural unemployment crisis stalking U.S. economy | date=October 6, 2009}}</ref>\n\n== Causes and examples ==\n{{further|Technological unemployment|Productivity improving technologies (economic history)}}\n\nFrom an individual perspective, structural unemployment can be due to:\n* Inability to afford or decision not to pursue further education or [[On-the-job training|job training]].\n* Choice of a field of study which did not produce marketable job skills.\n* Inability to afford relocation.\n* Inability to relocate due to inability to sell a house (for example due to the collapse of a [[real estate bubble]] or of the local economy).\n* Decision not to relocate, in order to stay with a spouse, family, friends, etc.<ref>[https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr566.pdf Mismatch Unemployment], Federal Reserve Bank of New York Staff Report No. 566, June 2013; accessed 2016-06-17]</ref>\n\nFrom a larger perspective, there can be a number of reasons for structural unemployment across large numbers of workers:\n* Technological [[obsolescence]] makes a specific expertise useless.  For example, demand for manual typesetters disappeared with digitization of printing plate production.\n* [[Productivity]] increases reduce the number of workers (with the same or similar skills) needed to satisfy [[demand]].\n* New technology significantly increases productivity, but requires a smaller number of higher-skilled workers.  For example, fewer agricultural workers are needed when the work is [[mechanized agriculture|mechanized]]; those that remain must be trained to operate equipment.  Another common example is the use of [[industrial robot]]s to automate manufacturing. A study by [[Carl Benedikt Frey]] and Michael Osborne found in 2013 that almost half of U.S jobs are at risk of automation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Frey|first=Carl Benedikt|last2=Osborne|first2=Michael A.|date=2017-01-01|title=The future of employment: How susceptible are jobs to computerisation?|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162516302244|journal=Technological Forecasting and Social Change|language=en|volume=114|pages=254\u2013280|doi=10.1016/j.techfore.2016.08.019|issn=0040-1625}}</ref>\n* Competition causes the same jobs to move to a different location, and workers do not or cannot follow.  Examples:\n** Manufacturing jobs in the [[United States]] moved from what are now called [[Rust Belt]] cities to lower-cost cities in the South and rural areas.\n** [[Globalization]] has caused many manufacturing jobs to move from high-wage to low-wage countries.\n** [[Free trade agreement]]s can cause jobs to move as competitive advantage changes.\n* Political changes, for example the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]].\n\nLarge-scale changes in the economy can be particularly challenging.  For example, if a large company is the only employer in a given industry for a certain city, when it closes workers will have no competing company to move to, and the local education system and government will be burdened with many people who need job re-training all at once (possibly at the same time the local economy fails to create new jobs due to decreased overall demand).\n\nEmployers may also reject workers for reasons unrelated to skills or geography, so for example structural unemployment can also result from [[discrimination]].\n\nWhile temporary changes in overall demand for labor cause [[cyclical unemployment]], structural unemployment can be caused by temporary changes in demand from different industries. For example, [[seasonal unemployment]] often affects [[farm worker]]s after harvesting is complete, and workers in [[resort town]]s after the tourist season ends.  The [[dot-com bubble]] caused a temporary spike in demand for information technology workers, which was suddenly reversed in 2000\u20132001.\n\nStructural unemployment is often associated with workers being unable to shift from industry to industry, but it can also happen within industries as technology changes the nature of work within a given field.<ref>[http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2012/04/the-structure-of-the-structural-unemployment-question.html The structure of the structural unemployment question], Macroblog, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, April 9, 2012; accessed 2016-06-17</ref><ref>[http://burning-glass.com/research/production-skills-gap/ Production Skills Gap], Burning Glass Technologies, Jan. 8, 2014; accessed 2016-06-17</ref> This is a driver of skills gaps as technology and globalization \"hollow out\" many middle-skill jobs, positions that traditionally have not required a college degree.<ref>[http://burning-glass.com/research/middle-skills/ Bridge the Gap: Rebuilding America\u2019s Middle Skills], Harvard Business School, Accenture, and Burning Glass Technologies, Nov. 14, 2014; accessed 2016-06-17</ref>\n\n== Relation to other unemployment ==\n\nStructural unemployment is hard to separate empirically from [[frictional unemployment]], except to say that for any given individual it lasts longer. As with frictional unemployment, simple demand-side stimulus will not work to easily abolish this type of unemployment.\n\n[[Seasonal unemployment]] may be seen as a kind of structural unemployment, since it is a type of unemployment that is linked to certain kinds of jobs (construction work, migratory farm work). The most-cited official unemployment measures erase this kind of unemployment from the statistics using \"seasonal adjustment\" techniques.\n\nStructural unemployment may also be encouraged to rise by persistent [[cyclical unemployment]]: if an economy suffers from long-lasting low aggregate demand, it means that many of the unemployed become disheartened, while their skills (including job-searching skills) become \"rusty\" and obsolete.<ref>[http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20150423214253/http://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/app/uploads/Long-Term-Unemployment.pdf \"Long-Term Unemployment,\"] Rockefeller Foundation, May 2016; accessed 2016-06-17</ref> Problems with debt may lead to homelessness and a fall into the [[Virtuous circle and vicious circle|vicious circle]] of [[poverty]]. This means that they may not fit the job vacancies that are created when the economy recovers. The implication is that sustained high demand may lower structural unemployment.<ref>[http://www.urban.org/research/publication/consequences-long-term-unemployment/view/full_report \"Consequences of Long-Term Unemployment,\"] Urban Institute, Aug. 20, 2013; accessed 2016-06-17</ref><ref>[http://www.brookings.edu/about/projects/bpea/papers/2014/are-longterm-unemployed-margins-labor-market \"Are the Long-Term Unemployed on the Margins of the Labor Market?\"] Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Brookings Institution, Spring 2014; accessed 2016-06-17</ref> This theory of persistence in structural unemployment has been referred to as an example of path dependence or \"[[Hysteresis (economics)|hysteresis]].\"\n\n==Debates==\n{{quote box | width=25em| bgcolor=#00C4DE |align=left|qalign=left |quote=<div style=\"text-align:left;\">'''Education and work exist in two alternative worlds that don\u2019t really connect'''\u2014 ''Sandalio Gomez'', emeritus professor at the IESE Business School in [[Madrid]]<ref>https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-07-01/spain-is-running-out-of-workers-with-almost-5-million-unemployed</ref> \n</div> |}}\nThere has been considerable debate over how much a role structural unemployment plays in the persistently high unemployment rates seen in much of the world since the 2007-09 global recession.

They assert that because the governmentally imposed minimum wage is higher than some individuals' [[marginal revenue product]] in any given job, those individuals remain unemployed because employers legally cannot pay them what they are \"worth.\"<ref>Robert Schenk.

When a minimum wage does not exist, more people may be employed, but they may be [[underemployment|underemployed]] and thus unable to fully provide for themselves.\n\nManagement professor Peter Cappelli blames poor human resource practices for complaints that not enough qualified job applicants are found, such as replacing skilled HR workers with software that is less capable of matching resumes that exhibit the right combination of skills but without word-for-word alignment with a job posting.  (This actually may be a form of [[frictional unemployment]] if a match will eventually be made, perhaps with a different employer.)  Cappelli also points to a decrease in [[apprenticeship]]s and hiring from within an organization.  Instead, companies attempt to avoid the time and cost of on-the-job training by hiring people from who already have experience doing the same job elsewhere (including at a competitor).<ref>{{cite book|title=Why Good People Can't Get Jobs: The Skills Gap and What Companies Can Do About It|isbn=978-1613630143|author=Peter Cappelli|year=2012|publisher=Wharton Digital Press}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Classical unemployment]]\n*[[Deindustrialization]]\n*[[Involuntary unemployment]]\n*[[Natural rate of unemployment]]\n*[[Jobless recovery]]\n*[[Post-industrial society]]\n*[[Reserve army of labour]]\n*[[Types of unemployment]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* {{Ford 2009 The lights in the tunnel}}\n* {{Citation | last = Rifkin | first = Jeremy | authorlink = Jeremy Rifkin | year = 1995 | title = [[The End of Work|The End of Work: The Decline of the Global Labor Force and the Dawn of the Post-Market Era]] | publisher = Tarcher\u2013G.P.

A study by [[Carl Benedikt Frey]] and Michael Osborne found in 2013 that almost half of U.S jobs are at risk of automation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Frey|first=Carl Benedikt|last2=Osborne|first2=Michael A.|date=2017-01-01|title=The future of employment: How susceptible are jobs to computerisation?|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162516302244|journal=Technological Forecasting and Social Change|language=en|volume=114|pages=254\u2013280|doi=10.1016/j.techfore.2016.08.019|issn=0040-1625}}</ref>\n* Competition causes the same jobs to move to a different location, and workers do not or cannot follow.  Examples:\n** Manufacturing jobs in the United States moved from what are now called [[Rust Belt]] cities to lower-cost cities in the South and rural areas.\n** [[Globalization]] has caused many manufacturing jobs to move from high-wage to low-wage countries.\n** [[Free trade agreement]]s can cause jobs to move as competitive advantage changes.\n* Political changes, for example the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]].\n\nLarge-scale changes in the economy can be particularly challenging.  For example, if a large company is the only employer in a given industry for a certain city, when it closes workers will have no competing company to move to, and the local education system and government will be burdened with many people who need job re-training all at once (possibly at the same time the local economy fails to create new jobs due to decreased overall demand).\n\nEmployers may also reject workers for reasons unrelated to skills or geography, so for example structural unemployment can also result from [[discrimination]].\n\nWhile temporary changes in overall demand for labor cause [[cyclical unemployment]], structural unemployment can be caused by temporary changes in demand from different industries.  For example, [[seasonal unemployment]] often affects [[farm worker]]s after harvesting is complete, and workers in [[resort town]]s after the tourist season ends.  The [[dot-com bubble]] caused a temporary spike in demand for information technology workers, which was suddenly reversed in 2000\u20132001.\n\nStructural unemployment is often associated with workers being unable to shift from industry to industry, but it can also happen within industries as technology changes the nature of work within a given field.<ref>[http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2012/04/the-structure-of-the-structural-unemployment-question.html The structure of the structural unemployment question], Macroblog, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, April 9, 2012; accessed 2016-06-17</ref><ref>[http://burning-glass.com/research/production-skills-gap/ Production Skills Gap], Burning Glass Technologies, Jan. 8, 2014; accessed 2016-06-17</ref> This is a driver of skills gaps as technology and globalization \"hollow out\" many middle-skill jobs, positions that traditionally have not required a college degree.<ref>[http://burning-glass.com/research/middle-skills/ Bridge the Gap: Rebuilding America\u2019s Middle Skills], Harvard Business School, Accenture, and Burning Glass Technologies, Nov. 14, 2014; accessed 2016-06-17</ref>\n\n== Relation to other unemployment ==\n\nStructural unemployment is hard to separate empirically from [[frictional unemployment]], except to say that for any given individual it lasts longer. As with frictional unemployment, simple demand-side stimulus will not work to easily abolish this type of unemployment.\n\n[[Seasonal unemployment]] may be seen as a kind of structural unemployment, since it is a type of unemployment that is linked to certain kinds of jobs (construction work, migratory farm work). The most-cited official unemployment measures erase this kind of unemployment from the statistics using \"seasonal adjustment\" techniques.\n\nStructural unemployment may also be encouraged to rise by persistent [[cyclical unemployment]]: if an economy suffers from long-lasting low aggregate demand, it means that many of the unemployed become disheartened, while their skills (including job-searching skills) become \"rusty\" and obsolete.<ref>[http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20150423214253/http://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/app/uploads/Long-Term-Unemployment.pdf \"Long-Term Unemployment,\"] Rockefeller Foundation, May 2016; accessed 2016-06-17</ref> Problems with debt may lead to homelessness and a fall into the [[Virtuous circle and vicious circle|vicious circle]] of poverty. This means that they may not fit the job vacancies that are created when the economy recovers. The implication is that sustained high demand may lower structural unemployment.<ref>[http://www.urban.org/research/publication/consequences-long-term-unemployment/view/full_report \"Consequences of Long-Term Unemployment,\"] Urban Institute, Aug. 20, 2013; accessed 2016-06-17</ref><ref>[http://www.brookings.edu/about/projects/bpea/papers/2014/are-longterm-unemployed-margins-labor-market \"Are the Long-Term Unemployed on the Margins of the Labor Market?\"] Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Brookings Institution, Spring 2014; accessed 2016-06-17</ref> This theory of persistence in structural unemployment has been referred to as an example of path dependence or \"[[Hysteresis (economics)|hysteresis]].\"\n\n==Debates==\n{{quote box | width=25em| bgcolor=#00C4DE |align=left|qalign=left |quote=<div style=\"text-align:left;\">'''Education and work exist in two alternative worlds that don\u2019t really connect'''\u2014 ''Sandalio Gomez'', emeritus professor at the IESE Business School in [[Madrid]]<ref>https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-07-01/spain-is-running-out-of-workers-with-almost-5-million-unemployed</ref> \n</div> |}}\nThere has been considerable debate over how much a role structural unemployment plays in the persistently high unemployment rates seen in much of the world since the 2007-09 global recession. [[Narayana Kocherlakota]], then president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, said in a 2010 speech that as much as 3 percent of the 9.5 percent unemployment rate at the time could be the result of a mismatch.<ref>[https://www.minneapolisfed.org/news-and-events/presidents-speeches/inside-the-fomc \"Inside the FOMC,\" President's Speeches, Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, Aug. 17, 2010; accessed 2016-06-17]</ref> Other studies argued that a skills mismatch was a minor factor, since unemployment rose for nearly all industries and demographic groups during the \"Great Recession.\"<ref>[http://www.epi.org/publication/lagging-demand-is-behind-high-long-term-unemployment/ Lagging Demand, Not Unemployability, Is Why Long-term Unemployment Remains So High], Economic Policy Institute, Aug. 19, 2014; accessed 2016-06-17</ref> A Federal Reserve Bank of New York study found no strong evidence of mismatch for construction workers, a group often alleged to be prone to structural unemployment because of the regional nature of construction.<ref>[http://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2012/03/skills-mismatch-construction-workers-and-the-labor-market.html#.V2R1leYrL64 \"Skills Mismatch, Construction Workers, and the Labor Market,\"] Liberty Street Economics blog, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, March 29, 2012; accessed 2016-06-17</ref>\n\nSome economists posit that the minimum wage is in part to blame for structural unemployment, although structural unemployment does exist even in the absence of a minimum wage. They assert that because the governmentally imposed minimum wage is higher than some individuals' [[marginal revenue product]] in any given job, those individuals remain unemployed because employers legally cannot pay them what they are \"worth.\"<ref>Robert Schenk. [http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/ECON303-9.2.pdf CyberEconomics: \u201cOverview: Resource Markets.\u201d] Accessed June 29, 2012</ref> Others believe that in such cases (for example, when a person is [[intellectual disability|intellectually disabled]] or suffers a debilitating physical condition) it is the responsibility of the state to provide for the citizen in question. When a minimum wage does not exist, more people may be employed, but they may be [[underemployment|underemployed]] and thus unable to fully provide for themselves.\n\nManagement professor Peter Cappelli blames poor human resource practices for complaints that not enough qualified job applicants are found, such as replacing skilled HR workers with software that is less capable of matching resumes that exhibit the right combination of skills but without word-for-word alignment with a job posting.  (This actually may be a form of [[frictional unemployment]] if a match will eventually be made, perhaps with a different employer.)  Cappelli also points to a decrease in [[apprenticeship]]s and hiring from within an organization.  Instead, companies attempt to avoid the time and cost of on-the-job training by hiring people from who already have experience doing the same job elsewhere (including at a competitor).<ref>{{cite book|title=Why Good People Can't Get Jobs: The Skills Gap and What Companies Can Do About It|isbn=978-1613630143|author=Peter Cappelli|year=2012|publisher=Wharton Digital Press}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Classical unemployment]]\n*[[Deindustrialization]]\n*[[Involuntary unemployment]]\n*[[Natural rate of unemployment]]\n*[[Jobless recovery]]\n*[[Post-industrial society]]\n*[[Reserve army of labour]]\n*[[Types of unemployment]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* {{Ford 2009 The lights in the tunnel}}\n* {{Citation | last = Rifkin | first = Jeremy | authorlink = Jeremy Rifkin | year = 1995 | title = [[The End of Work|The End of Work: The Decline of the Global Labor Force and the Dawn of the Post-Market Era]] | publisher = Tarcher\u2013G.P.

He reportedly requested styling echoing the [[Aston Martin DB4]]'s tapering rear bodywork and the sleek front of the [[Jaguar E-Type|Jaguar E-type]]. The 350 GTV had many styling details that were unusual at the time of its introduction, including [[Hidden headlamp|hidden headlamps]] and six [[Exhaust system|exhaust tailpipes]] (three on each side of the car's rear). The body was constructed of aluminum and steel. As workers at Sargiotto were primarily skilled in building molds for plastic products, the 350 GTV's body had numerous fit and finish issues.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Lyons|first=Pete|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/18937830|title=The Complete Book of Lamborghini|date=1988|publisher=Beekman House|year=|isbn=0881764892|location=New York|pages=|oclc=18937830}}</ref>\n\nInitially, Bizzarini designed a racing-style [[Space frame#Cars|tubular spaceframe]] chassis for the 350 GTV.

This was the first iteration of the [[Lamborghini V12]] series of engines, which would power future Lamborghini models up through the end of [[Lamborghini Murci\u00e9lago|Murci\u00e9lago]] production in 2010. Bizzarini developed a 3.5&nbsp;[[litre]] racing-specification [[V12 engine]], with an output of {{convert|255|kW|PS bhp|0|lk=on|abbr=on|sp=}} at 8,000&nbsp;rpm, and [[torque]] of {{convert|326|Nm|0|lk=on|abbr=on}},{{r|Lambo_350GTV}} using the [[Deutsches Institut f\u00fcr Normung|DIN]] measurement standard.{{r|LamboCars_350GTV}}{{r|QV500_350GTV}} This design was derived from Bizzarini's plan for a 1.5 litre [[Formula One]] racing engine.<ref name=\":0\" /> Top speed was claimed by the factory to be {{Convert|280|km/h|mph|abbr=}},<ref name=\":1\" /> although this was an estimate as the car was never driven or tested by the factory.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThis engine had a [[compression ratio]] of 9.5:1 and relatively aggressive [[valve timing]] compared to later versions of the Lamborghini V12. The higher [[redline]], compression ratio and timing made the 350 GTV's engine more suitable for competition use rather than as a comfortable road car. The 350 GTV engine was also equipped with six downdraft [[Weber carburetor|Weber carburetors]] and a [[Dry sump|dry sump lubrication system]].<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Rive Box|first=Rob de la|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/8431194|title=Lamborghini : the cars from Sant' Agata Bolognese|last2=Crump|first2=Richard|date=1981|publisher=Osprey|others=|year=|isbn=0-85045-408-5|location=London|pages=|oclc=8431194}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe transmission was a 5 speed manual made by [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]].

He reportedly requested styling echoing the [[Aston Martin DB4]]'s tapering rear bodywork and the sleek front of the [[Jaguar E-Type|Jaguar E-type]]. The 350 GTV had many styling details that were unusual at the time of its introduction, including [[Hidden headlamp|hidden headlamps]] and six [[Exhaust system|exhaust tailpipes]] (three on each side of the car's rear). The body was constructed of aluminum and steel. As workers at Sargiotto were primarily skilled in building molds for plastic products, the 350 GTV's body had numerous fit and finish issues.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Lyons|first=Pete|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/18937830|title=The Complete Book of Lamborghini|date=1988|publisher=Beekman House|year=|isbn=0881764892|location=New York|pages=|oclc=18937830}}</ref>\n\nInitially, Bizzarini designed a racing-style [[Space frame#Cars|tubular spaceframe]] chassis for the 350 GTV.

This was the first iteration of the [[Lamborghini V12]] series of engines, which would power future Lamborghini models up through the end of [[Lamborghini Murci\u00e9lago|Murci\u00e9lago]] production in 2010.

The higher [[redline]], compression ratio and timing made the 350 GTV's engine more suitable for competition use rather than as a comfortable road car. The 350 GTV engine was also equipped with six downdraft [[Weber carburetor|Weber carburetors]] and a [[Dry sump|dry sump lubrication system]].<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Rive Box|first=Rob de la|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/8431194|title=Lamborghini : the cars from Sant' Agata Bolognese|last2=Crump|first2=Richard|date=1981|publisher=Osprey|others=|year=|isbn=0-85045-408-5|location=London|pages=|oclc=8431194}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe transmission was a 5 speed manual made by [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]].

The show was broadcast on [[Hum TV]]. The show is now airing in [[Middle East]] on channel [[Middle East Broadcasting Center#MBC Bollywood|MBC Bollywood]] under the title ''\u062d\u0628 \u0639\u0628\u0631 \u062d\u062f\u0648\u062f'' (Meaning ''Love Across Borders''). It is one of the [[Pakistani dramas|highest-rated Pakistani television series]] of all the time.\n\nDastaan was also aired in India on [[Zindagi (TV channel)|Zindagi]] under the title ''[[Waqt Ne Kiya Kya Haseen Sitam (TV series)|Waqt Ne Kiya Kya Haseen Sitam]]'' from 23 March 2015 onwards. Previously, it was decided to run the show under the title ''Lakeerein'', but the decision was later changed. Dastaan also aired on [[MBC Bollywood]] for the [[Arab world|Arab World]] under the title [[Dastaan (TV series)|''Hub Aber Hudud'']]. \n\n==Plot==\nBuilt on the true events of partition of 1947, the series depicts the events of rioting and chaos in 1947. The series is based on the novel Bano.\n\nBased on the novel, [[Bano (novel)|Bano]], ''Dastaan'' begins with the wedding of Suraiya ([[Saba Qamar]]) and Salim ([[Ahsan Khan (actor)|Ahsan Khan]]). Suraiya's nephew, Hassan ([[Fawad Khan]]) was the son of Bano's first cousin Rasheeda. When Hassan's father died, he and his mother were kicked out of his fathers house by his paternal family and they moved back to Rasheeda's maternal house. Bano, Suraiya, Faheem and Salim and Hassan were childhood friends (and cousins) and all grew up together. When Hassan went to study at University he left home and went to Islamia college in Peshawar. Hassan returns for Saleem and Suraiya's wedding where Hassan and Bano meet for the first time as adults after 3 years. (The last time they met was 3 years ago and they were kids). Hassan starts teasing and flirting with Bano and they slowly begin to develop feelings for each other, with Hassan visiting [[Ludhiana]] every now and then. Hassan is in his final year at the [[Islamia College (Lahore)|Islamia College]] as an engineering student. He is an active supporter of the [[All-India Muslim League]], and the leader of the Ludhiana Branch. He strongly believes in the establishment of Pakistan and is an avid follower of [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah|Qaid-E-Azam]], the leader of the Muslim League and [[Pakistan Movement]]. Meanwhile, Saleem is an active supporter of the [[Indian National Congress]], with all his friends being [[Hindu]]. He strictly believes that the establishment of Pakistan will not help, but rather lessen the position of Muslims in India. The political debate between Saleem and Hassan begins as friendly competition, but intensifies as conditions worsen throughout India for Muslims. Saleem, hot-tempered and rash, begins to bring political debates into family life and eventually forbids Suraiya to visit Hassan, her nephew. But Hassan is not dissuaded. He continues to spread the message of Pakistan throughout Saleem's family, causing Saleem's anger to explode on many occasions. Other than Saleem, his entire family become strong supporters of the Muslim League, especially Bano, who makes posters and signs for the [[Pakistan Movement]].\n\nBibi, [[Samina Peerzada]] tells Suraiya that a marriage proposal has come for Bano from [[Patiala]]. Suraiya panicked and tells her sister Rashida that Bano and Hassan like each other and have become close, and that if they don't get married Bano would commit suicide and Hassan wouldn't marry anyone else either. Upon hearing this rasheeda takes her brother (Kareem bhai) and sister in law (sakina bhabhi) and asks for Banos hand in marriage for Hassan. Saleem overhears this and politely tells them that they can leave because a proposal has come for Bano. Bano's parents become angry and ask Saleem who he had in mind and Saleem tells them for his Hindu friend called Ram. Bano's parent angry at Saleem, panic and agree for Bano's proposal with Hassan.  Hassan and Bano eventually become engaged, and Saleem decides to leave behind his rivalry with Hassan for Bano's sake. Soon, Hassan gets a job in [[Rawalpindi]] and has to leave immediately. He leaves Ludhiana, with the promise that they will be back 4 months later for the wedding.  Meanwhile, Suraiya is 4 months pregnant.\n\nDuring this time tensions between [[Hindus]] and [[Muslims]] escalate dramatically, and violence breaks out all across India. Hate crimes against Muslims become common, and fighting spreads to all states, getting threateningly closer to Ludhiana every day. As the fighting becomes more pronounced, Muslims retaliate, leaving nobody safe. Saleem seems to be under the impression that his [[Hindu]] friends and their families will be able to protect his family from rioters, after he asked them whether him and his entire family and relatives should migrate to Pakistan, but upon trying to get this reassurance from them, they say, \"What will we say to them? Why would they listen to us?\"  Saleem begins sensing a cold distance his [[Hindu]] friends have developed towards him and, while on his way home, encounters a sobbing Muslim man who lost his entire family and home. He begins to realize the importance of the creation of [[Pakistan]] and rushes home, telling his family to tightly lock up their doors and gates and to be ready for any kind of attack.\n\nOn a fateful night, a group of [[Sikhs]] and [[Hindus]] attack the family's home.  All of the men (which includes many other Muslims who sought refuge in their house) stay on the bottom floor with their swords and knives intending to fight. All the women (including Bano, Suraiya, and Bano's mother, Bibi, Sakina Khala and her daughters) are huddled on the roof of the house.  Salim and all the men are brutally murdered in a terrible [[Mass murder|massacre]]. A pregnant Suraiya, upon seeing her husband stabbed, throws herself off the roof to be with her dying husband. She lays next to him, trying to move her bloodied hand to be with his, but a rioter brutally stabs her womb, killing Suraiya and her baby. Sakina Khala and her daughters also throw themselves from the roof while others are carried away to be raped and killed. Bano's other brother, Faheem, before being killed, shouts to his mother: \"Choke Bano!\" Bibi, with Bano's tearful consent, tries to choke her to death to protect her from losing her honor, virtue, and religion from the rapists, but two of Saleem's Hindu friends arrive claiming to save them.\n\nSaleem's friend, Ram, tries to rape Bano, but his other friend saves her by killing Ram out of guilt. Bano, alone with Bibi, manages to escape [[Ludhiana]], where they seek shelter in a refugee camp for Muslims. The [[Muslim]] refugees are headed by a young brave Muslim man who lost his entire family. Thirsty and hungry, they try to walk to [[Pakistan]], encountering poisoned wells along the way. Eventually, [[Hindu]] rioters attack this caravan. Bano is separated from Bibi and both are gang raped. Bano crawls toward her mother's now lifeless body, seeing her [[Ta'wiz]] necklace next to it. Bano, grief-stricken and in shock, wears it and lays next to her body.\n\nA Sikh man ([[Bilal Khan (actor)|Bilal Khan]]) stumbles upon Bano and her dead mother, and he helps nurse her back to health. He then boards her on a train heading towards [[Lahore]] and leaves. It was common for trains to arrive in [[Lahore]] full of dead Muslims with only a few survivors and vice versa. Soon this train is attacked by rioters. Basant Singh ([[Babrik Shah (actor)|Babrik Shah]]), a rioter, chases after Bano on the train. She falls unconscious, and Basant Singh kidnaps her, bringing her to his home in [[Kapurthala]]. She awakens in his home where he and his mother live. At first, she refuses to tell them her name, and so Basant Singh calls her Sundar [[Kaur]], meaning \"beautiful princess\" in [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]. He gives her the impression that he will take her to [[Pakistan]] himself once the dangers are gone. He also tells her she can write to Hassan and he'll deliver the letters. Bano believes his lies and cannot wait to go to [[Pakistan]].\n\nNearly a year later, Basant has not lived up to his promise, claiming that the roadways are still blocked and that traveling to Pakistan is too dangerous. Eventually, Bano learns of his plans to forcibly marry her and convert her, and she attempts to run away again. This time though, when Basant catches her, he doesn't treat her gently as the first time. He tries whatever method he can to break her; beating her, raping her, forcing her to become a [[Sikh]], marrying her, and in the end, having her give birth to his child.\n\nAfter many years Basant Singh runs to the roof to go save his child, because he is about to fall off. Instead, he slips, falls, and dies. Bano immediately takes her son and leaves to go to Pakistan. Whilst this is happening, Hassan eventually falls in love with Rabia, his cousin, and they become engaged. Bano is taken in by a lady who sends a letter to Hassan to inform him that Bano has arrived.\n\nHassan receives the letter and takes Bano and the child home. Hassan decides to marry Bano, and wants to break off his engagement to Rabia. Rabia and her mother come to know of this and visit Hassan's house. Rabia's mother tells Rabia to take care of Bano to please Hassan. However, one day, he overhears a conversation between his parents about Rabia taking care of Bano so Hassan can see the goodness in her. He argues with Rabia, but Rabia insists that her love is truer than Bano's. Bano overhears this and interrupts them telling them that if they truly want to do something for her, they should get married. The next day, Hassan finds out that Bano has left the house. Hassan spends many days and weeks searching for Bano. He blames Rabia for this. Bano is living with a family where she does their household chores, she gets a job in a modern family where she realises that Pakistan is not how she thought it would be. She is fired from the job. One day Hassan sees her in the mosque and he runs after her to get her back home but Bano says her friend to go to Hassan and ask him to forget Bano. Hassan then goes home and agrees to marry Rabia as Bano had wished their marriage.\nOne day she goes to a birthday party where she meets a gentleman who has similar thoughts to those of Bano. He offers Bano to come and work in his office where they work for the welfare of people. Bano is very happy and offers his proposal.\nOne day, Rabia comes to know about Bano's whereabouts and she begs to her to marry Hassan. Eventually, Bano agrees and she promises that she will come. She goes to her office where the same gentleman leads her to storage room and attempts to abuse her. She grabs hold of a scissor, and stabs hims to death. She is arrested by police. Bano is taken to a mental asylum for recovery. Later, Hassan and Rabia who are now husband and wife, visit Bano.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Fawad Khan]] as Hassan\n* [[Sanam Baloch]] as Bano\n* [[Mehreen Raheel]] as Rabia\n* [[Ahsan Khan (actor)|Ahsan Khan]] as Saleem (Bano's elder brother)\n* [[Saba Qamar]] as Suraiyyah (Saleem's Wife)\n* [[Saba Hameed]] as Rasheeda (Hassan's Mother)\n* [[Qavi Khan]] as Naseeb Bhai (Bano's Father)\n* [[Samina Peerzada]] as Saliha or \"Bibi\" (Bano's Mother)\n* [[Affan Waheed]] as Nadir (Hassan's Friend)\n* Babrik Shah as Basant Singh\n* [[Seemi Raheel]] as Sakeena (Hassan's Maami)\n* [[Asma Abbas]] as Sultana (Rabia's Mother)\n* [[Naeem Tahir]] as Rabia's Father\n* [[Daniyal Raheel]] as Faheem (Bano's younger Brother)\n* Anita Fatima Camphor as Jameela (Hassan's Aunt)\n* [[Khayyam Sarhadi]] as Jameela's husband\n* Humaira Abbasi as Kaamini\n* [[Fawad Jalal]] as Laxman\n\n===Guest stars===\n* [[Samina Ahmad]] as orphanage caretaker\n* [[Shazia Afgan]] as Bano's friend\n* [[Bilal Khan (actor)|Bilal Khan]]\n* [[Sangeeta (Pakistani actress)|Sangeeta]] as Basanta's mom\n* Nasreen Qureshi as Basanta's aunt\n* Azra Mansoor as Shazia's mother\n* Farooq Zameer\n\n==Locations==\nThe serial takes place at a number of locations.

Director [[Haissam Hussain]] stated in an interview <ref>[http://vidpk.com/41855/Morning-With-Hum-Momina-Duraid--Haissam-Hussain--Mehreen-Raheel--Sanam-Baloch-P-2 Morning With Hum - Haissam Hussain and Momina Duraid discuss \"Dastaan\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101210060120/http://vidpk.com/41855/Morning-With-Hum-Momina-Duraid--Haissam-Hussain--Mehreen-Raheel--Sanam-Baloch-P-2/ |date=10 December 2010 }}/</ref> that [[Film production|production]] for the drama began months in advance, and that the filming itself only took a little over two months. The show was broadcast on [[Hum TV]]. The show is now airing in [[Middle East]] on channel [[Middle East Broadcasting Center#MBC Bollywood|MBC Bollywood]] under the title ''\u062d\u0628 \u0639\u0628\u0631 \u062d\u062f\u0648\u062f'' (Meaning ''Love Across Borders''). It is one of the [[Pakistani dramas|highest-rated Pakistani television series]] of all the time.\n\nDastaan was also aired in India on [[Zindagi (TV channel)|Zindagi]] under the title ''[[Waqt Ne Kiya Kya Haseen Sitam (TV series)|Waqt Ne Kiya Kya Haseen Sitam]]'' from 23 March 2015 onwards. Previously, it was decided to run the show under the title ''Lakeerein'', but the decision was later changed.\n\n==Plot==\nBuilt on the true events of partition of 1947, the series depicts the events of rioting and chaos in 1947. The series is based on the novel Bano.\n\nBased on the novel, [[Bano (novel)|Bano]], ''Dastaan'' begins with the wedding of Suraiya ([[Saba Qamar]]) and Salim ([[Ahsan Khan (actor)|Ahsan Khan]]). Suraiya's nephew, Hassan ([[Fawad Khan]]) was the son of Bano's first cousin Rasheeda. When Hassan's father died, he and his mother were kicked out of his fathers house by his paternal family and they moved back to Rasheeda's maternal house. Bano, Suraiya, Faheem and Salim and Hassan were childhood friends (and cousins) and all grew up together. When Hassan went to study at University he left home and went to Islamia college in Peshawar. Hassan returns for Saleem and Suraiya's wedding where Hassan and Bano meet for the first time as adults after 3 years. (The last time they met was 3 years ago and they were kids). Hassan starts teasing and flirting with Bano and they slowly begin to develop feelings for each other, with Hassan visiting [[Ludhiana]] every now and then. Hassan is in his final year at the [[Islamia College (Lahore)|Islamia College]] as an engineering student. He is an active supporter of the [[All-India Muslim League]], and the leader of the Ludhiana Branch. He strongly believes in the establishment of Pakistan and is an avid follower of [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah|Qaid-E-Azam]], the leader of the Muslim League and [[Pakistan Movement]]. Meanwhile, Saleem is an active supporter of the [[Indian National Congress]], with all his friends being [[Hindu]]. He strictly believes that the establishment of Pakistan will not help, but rather lessen the position of Muslims in India. The political debate between Saleem and Hassan begins as friendly competition, but intensifies as conditions worsen throughout India for Muslims. Saleem, hot-tempered and rash, begins to bring political debates into family life and eventually forbids Suraiya to visit Hassan, her nephew. But Hassan is not dissuaded. He continues to spread the message of Pakistan throughout Saleem's family, causing Saleem's anger to explode on many occasions. Other than Saleem, his entire family become strong supporters of the Muslim League, especially Bano, who makes posters and signs for the [[Pakistan Movement]].\n\nBibi, [[Samina Peerzada]] tells Suraiya that a marriage proposal has come for Bano from [[Patiala]]. Suraiya panicked and tells her sister Rashida that Bano and Hassan like each other and have become close, and that if they don't get married Bano would commit suicide and Hassan wouldn't marry anyone else either. Upon hearing this rasheeda takes her brother (Kareem bhai) and sister in law (sakina bhabhi) and asks for Banos hand in marriage for Hassan. Saleem overhears this and politely tells them that they can leave because a proposal has come for Bano. Bano's parents become angry and ask Saleem who he had in mind and Saleem tells them for his Hindu friend called Ram. Bano's parent angry at Saleem, panic and agree for Bano's proposal with Hassan.  Hassan and Bano eventually become engaged, and Saleem decides to leave behind his rivalry with Hassan for Bano's sake. Soon, Hassan gets a job in [[Rawalpindi]] and has to leave immediately. He leaves Ludhiana, with the promise that they will be back 4 months later for the wedding.  Meanwhile, Suraiya is 4 months pregnant.\n\nDuring this time tensions between [[Hindus]] and [[Muslims]] escalate dramatically, and violence breaks out all across India. Hate crimes against Muslims become common, and fighting spreads to all states, getting threateningly closer to Ludhiana every day. As the fighting becomes more pronounced, Muslims retaliate, leaving nobody safe. Saleem seems to be under the impression that his [[Hindu]] friends and their families will be able to protect his family from rioters, after he asked them whether him and his entire family and relatives should migrate to Pakistan, but upon trying to get this reassurance from them, they say, \"What will we say to them? Why would they listen to us?\"  Saleem begins sensing a cold distance his [[Hindu]] friends have developed towards him and, while on his way home, encounters a sobbing Muslim man who lost his entire family and home. He begins to realize the importance of the creation of [[Pakistan]] and rushes home, telling his family to tightly lock up their doors and gates and to be ready for any kind of attack.\n\nOn a fateful night, a group of [[Sikhs]] and [[Hindus]] attack the family's home.  All of the men (which includes many other Muslims who sought refuge in their house) stay on the bottom floor with their swords and knives intending to fight. All the women (including Bano, Suraiya, and Bano's mother, Bibi, Sakina Khala and her daughters) are huddled on the roof of the house.  Salim and all the men are brutally murdered in a terrible [[Mass murder|massacre]]. A pregnant Suraiya, upon seeing her husband stabbed, throws herself off the roof to be with her dying husband. She lays next to him, trying to move her bloodied hand to be with his, but a rioter brutally stabs her womb, killing Suraiya and her baby. Sakina Khala and her daughters also throw themselves from the roof while others are carried away to be raped and killed. Bano's other brother, Faheem, before being killed, shouts to his mother: \"Choke Bano!\" Bibi, with Bano's tearful consent, tries to choke her to death to protect her from losing her honor, virtue, and religion from the rapists, but two of Saleem's Hindu friends arrive claiming to save them.\n\nSaleem's friend, Ram, tries to rape Bano, but his other friend saves her by killing Ram out of guilt. Bano, alone with Bibi, manages to escape [[Ludhiana]], where they seek shelter in a refugee camp for Muslims. The [[Muslim]] refugees are headed by a young brave Muslim man who lost his entire family. Thirsty and hungry, they try to walk to [[Pakistan]], encountering poisoned wells along the way. Eventually, [[Hindu]] rioters attack this caravan. Bano is separated from Bibi and both are gang raped. Bano crawls toward her mother's now lifeless body, seeing her [[Ta'wiz]] necklace next to it. Bano, grief-stricken and in shock, wears it and lays next to her body.\n\nA Sikh man ([[Bilal Khan (actor)|Bilal Khan]]) stumbles upon Bano and her dead mother, and he helps nurse her back to health. He then boards her on a train heading towards [[Lahore]] and leaves. It was common for trains to arrive in [[Lahore]] full of dead Muslims with only a few survivors and vice versa. Soon this train is attacked by rioters. Basant Singh ([[Babrik Shah (actor)|Babrik Shah]]), a rioter, chases after Bano on the train. She falls unconscious, and Basant Singh kidnaps her, bringing her to his home in [[Kapurthala]]. She awakens in his home where he and his mother live. At first, she refuses to tell them her name, and so Basant Singh calls her Sundar [[Kaur]], meaning \"beautiful princess\" in [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]. He gives her the impression that he will take her to [[Pakistan]] himself once the dangers are gone. He also tells her she can write to Hassan and he'll deliver the letters. Bano believes his lies and cannot wait to go to [[Pakistan]].\n\nNearly a year later, Basant has not lived up to his promise, claiming that the roadways are still blocked and that traveling to Pakistan is too dangerous. Eventually, Bano learns of his plans to forcibly marry her and convert her, and she attempts to run away again. This time though, when Basant catches her, he doesn't treat her gently as the first time. He tries whatever method he can to break her; beating her, raping her, forcing her to become a [[Sikh]], marrying her, and in the end, having her give birth to his child.\n\nAfter many years Basant Singh runs to the roof to go save his child, because he is about to fall off. Instead, he slips, falls, and dies. Bano immediately takes her son and leaves to go to Pakistan. Whilst this is happening, Hassan eventually falls in love with Rabia, his cousin, and they become engaged. Bano is taken in by a lady who sends a letter to Hassan to inform him that Bano has arrived.\n\nHassan receives the letter and takes Bano and the child home. Hassan decides to marry Bano, and wants to break off his engagement to Rabia. Rabia and her mother come to know of this and visit Hassan's house. Rabia's mother tells Rabia to take care of Bano to please Hassan. However, one day, he overhears a conversation between his parents about Rabia taking care of Bano so Hassan can see the goodness in her. He argues with Rabia, but Rabia insists that her love is truer than Bano's. Bano overhears this and interrupts them telling them that if they truly want to do something for her, they should get married. The next day, Hassan finds out that Bano has left the house. Hassan spends many days and weeks searching for Bano. He blames Rabia for this. Bano is living with a family where she does their household chores, she gets a job in a modern family where she realises that Pakistan is not how she thought it would be. She is fired from the job. One day Hassan sees her in the mosque and he runs after her to get her back home but Bano says her friend to go to Hassan and ask him to forget Bano. Hassan then goes home and agrees to marry Rabia as Bano had wished their marriage.\nOne day she goes to a birthday party where she meets a gentleman who has similar thoughts to those of Bano. He offers Bano to come and work in his office where they work for the welfare of people. Bano is very happy and offers his proposal.\nOne day, Rabia comes to know about Bano's whereabouts and she begs to her to marry Hassan. Eventually, Bano agrees and she promises that she will come. She goes to her office where the same gentleman leads her to storage room and attempts to abuse her. She grabs hold of a scissor, and stabs hims to death. She is arrested by police. Bano is taken to a mental asylum for recovery. Later, Hassan and Rabia who are now husband and wife, visit Bano.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Fawad Khan]] as Hassan\n* [[Sanam Baloch]] as Bano\n* [[Mehreen Raheel]] as Rabia\n* [[Ahsan Khan (actor)|Ahsan Khan]] as Saleem (Bano's elder brother)\n* [[Saba Qamar]] as Suraiyyah (Saleem's Wife)\n* [[Saba Hameed]] as Rasheeda (Hassan's Mother)\n* [[Qavi Khan]] as Naseeb Bhai (Bano's Father)\n* [[Samina Peerzada]] as Saliha or \"Bibi\" (Bano's Mother)\n* [[Affan Waheed]] as Nadir (Hassan's Friend)\n* Babrik Shah as Basant Singh\n* [[Seemi Raheel]] as Sakeena (Hassan's Maami)\n* [[Asma Abbas]] as Sultana (Rabia's Mother)\n* [[Naeem Tahir]] as Rabia's Father\n* [[Daniyal Raheel]] as Faheem (Bano's younger Brother)\n* Anita Fatima Camphor as Jameela (Hassan's Aunt)\n* [[Khayyam Sarhadi]] as Jameela's husband\n* Humaira Abbasi as Kaamini\n* [[Fawad Jalal]] as Laxman\n\n===Guest stars===\n* [[Samina Ahmad]] as orphanage caretaker\n* [[Shazia Afgan]] as Bano's friend\n* [[Bilal Khan (actor)|Bilal Khan]]\n* [[Sangeeta (Pakistani actress)|Sangeeta]] as Basanta's mom\n* Nasreen Qureshi as Basanta's aunt\n* Azra Mansoor as Shazia's mother\n* Farooq Zameer\n\n==Locations==\nThe serial takes place at a number of locations.
