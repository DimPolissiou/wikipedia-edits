In this tale set in India, the young mongoose saves his family from a [[Common krait|krait]] and from Nag and Nagaina, two [[cobra]]s. The story was later made into several films and a song by [[Donovan]], among other references. A mongoose is also featured in [[Bram Stoker]]'s novel ''[[The Lair of the White Worm]]''. The main character, Adam Salton, purchases one to independently hunt snakes. Another mongoose features in the denouement of the [[Sherlock Holmes]] story \"[[The Adventure of the Crooked Man]]\", by [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]].

It was brought to [[Duluth, Minnesota]] by a merchant seaman and faced being euthanized.

Its establishment was overseen by Slavonska Po\u017eega's police chief, [[Milivoj A\u0161ner]]. The camp was commanded by Captain Ivan Stiper and guarded by the 14th Usta\u0161e Company. The accommodations were insufficient to handle the large number of detainees, leading to severe overcrowding. Detainees were also given inadequate amounts of food, illnesses ran rampant and medical treatment was virtually non-existent. Although it was nominally a transit camp, many detainees were tortured and even killed by the guards. On 26 August, 785 detainees from [[Derventa]] and [[Brod, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosanski Brod]] were shot. The camp was dissolved on 22 October. At least 9,500 detainees passed through it during its existence. The Usta\u0161e administration continued to process belongings that had been stolen from the detainees until mid-November.\n\nIn 2005, prosecutors in Croatia charged A\u0161ner with [[war crimes]] and [[crimes against humanity]] for his role in the deportation of Serbs and [[Jews]] from Slavonska Po\u017eega in 1941 and 1942. [[Austria]], where A\u0161ner was living, refused to extradite him, and he died in 2011 without ever having gone to trial.\n\n==Background==\n===Interwar Yugoslavia===\nEthnic tensions between [[Serbs]] and [[Croats]] increased following the establishment of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes in the aftermath of [[World War I]]. During the [[interwar period]], many Croats came to resent Serb political hegemony in the newly established state, which resulted in the passing of legislation that favoured Serb political, religious and business interests.{{sfn|Mojzes|2011|p=158}} Tensions flared in 1928, following the shooting of five Croatian parliamentary deputies by the Montenegrin Serb politician [[Puni\u0161a Ra\u010di\u0107]]. Two died on the spot and two others were wounded but survived. A fifth, the opposition leader [[Stjepan Radi\u0107]], died nearly two months later of complications attributed to the shooting. In January 1929, King [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Alexander]] instituted a [[6 January Dictatorship|royal dictatorship]] and renamed the country [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. Shortly thereafter, the Croatian politician [[Ante Paveli\u0107]] formed the [[Usta\u0161e]], a [[Croatian nationalism|Croatian nationalist]] and [[fascism|fascist]] movement which sought to achieve Croatian independence through violent means. The Usta\u0161e were outlawed in Yugoslavia, but received covert assistance from [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], which had territorial aspirations over [[Istria]] and [[Dalmatia]]. The Usta\u0161e carried out a number of actions aimed at undermining Yugoslavia, most notably the [[Velebit uprising]] in 1932 and the assassination of King Alexander in [[Marseilles]] in 1934. Following Alexander's assassination, the Usta\u0161e movement's senior-most leaders, including Paveli\u0107, were tried [[trial in absentia|in absentia]] in both France and Yugoslavia and sentenced to death, but were granted protection by Mussolini and thus evaded capture.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|pp=25\u201334}}\n\nFollowing the 1938 ''[[Anschluss]]'' between [[Nazi Germany]] and [[First Austrian Republic|Austria]], Yugoslavia came to share its northwestern border with Germany and fell under increasing pressure as its neighbours aligned themselves with the [[Axis powers]]. In April 1939, Italy opened a second frontier with Yugoslavia when it [[Italian invasion of Albania|invaded]] and occupied neighbouring [[Albanian Kingdom (1928\u201339)|Albania]].{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=6\u20137}} At the outbreak of [[World War II]], the Royal Yugoslav Government declared its [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]].{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2008|p=8}} Between September and November 1940, [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u201346)|Hungary]] and [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] joined the [[Tripartite Pact]], aligning themselves with the Axis, and Italy [[Greco-Italian War|invaded Greece]]. Yugoslavia was by then almost completely surrounded by the Axis powers and their satellites, and its neutral stance toward the war became strained.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=6\u20137}} In late February 1941, [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] joined the Pact. The following day, German troops entered Bulgaria from Romania, closing the ring around Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=12}} Intending to secure his southern flank for the [[Operation Barbarossa|impending attack]] on the [[Soviet Union]], German dictator [[Adolf Hitler]] began placing heavy pressure on Yugoslavia to join the Axis. On 25 March 1941, after some delay, the Royal Yugoslav Government conditionally signed the Pact. Two days later, a group of pro-Western, [[Serbian nationalism|Serbian nationalist]] [[Royal Yugoslav Air Force]] officers deposed the country's [[regent]], [[Prince Paul of Yugoslavia|Prince Paul]], in a bloodless [[Yugoslav coup d'\u00e9tat|coup d'\u00e9tat]]. They placed his teenage nephew [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|Peter]] on the throne and brought to power a \"government of national unity\" led by the head of the Royal Yugoslav Air Force, General [[Du\u0161an Simovi\u0107]].{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2008|pp=10\u201313}} The coup enraged Hitler, who immediately ordered Yugoslavia's [[invasion of Yugoslavia|invasion]], which commenced on 6 April 1941.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=15}}\n\n===Creation of the NDH===\n[[File:Ndh 1941.png|thumb|right|230px|A map depicting the occupation and partition of Yugoslavia, 1941\u20131943]]\nYugoslavia was quickly overwhelmed by the combined strength of the Axis powers and surrendered in less than two weeks. The government and royal family went into exile, and the country was occupied and dismembered by its neighbours. Hitler wished to irrevocably dismantle Yugoslavia, which he dubbed a \"[[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles]] construct\".{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2008|p=21}} Serbia was reduced to its pre-[[Balkan Wars|Balkan War]] borders, becoming the only country in the Western Balkans to be directly occupied by the Germans.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2008|p=49}} Serb-inhabited territories west of the [[Drina]] River were incorporated into the Axis [[puppet state]] known as the [[Independent State of Croatia]] ({{lang-hr|Nezavisna dr\u017eava Hrvatska}}; NDH), which included most of modern-day [[Croatia]], all of modern-day [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], and parts of modern-day [[Serbia]].{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=272}} The establishment of the NDH had been announced over the radio by [[Slavko Kvaternik]], a former [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] officer who had been in contact with Croatian nationalists abroad, on 10 April.{{sfn|Goldstein|1999|p=133}}{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=155}}\n\nPaveli\u0107 entered the NDH on 13 April and reached [[Zagreb]] two days later. The same day, Germany and Italy extended diplomatic recognition to the NDH. Paveli\u0107 assumed control and bestowed himself the title ''[[Poglavnik]]'' (\"leader\").{{sfn|Goldstein|1999|p=133}} At the time of its establishment, the NDH had a population of 6.5 million inhabitants, about half of whom were Croats. It was also inhabited by nearly two million Serbs, who constituted about one-third of its total population.{{sfn|Hoare|2007|pp=19\u201320}} Lands inhabited by Serbs accounted for 60\u201370 percent of the NDH's total landmass. Nevertheless, Serbs \u2013 along with others whom the Usta\u0161e deemed \"undesirable\", such as [[Jews]] and [[Romani people|Roma]] \u2013 were denied citizenship on the basis that they were not [[Aryan race|Aryan]]s. Within hours of the NDH's creation, businesses brandished signs reading: \"No Serbs, Gypsies, Jews and dogs\". Additionally, immediate measures were taken to expunge the presence of the [[Cyrillic alphabet]] from the public sphere.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2008|pp=31\u201332}} On 17 April, the Usta\u0161e instituted the Legal Provision for the Defence of the People and State, a law legitimizing the establishment of concentration camps and the mass shooting of hostages in the NDH. Thirty concentration camps in total were established across the puppet state.{{sfn|Goldstein|1999|pp=136\u2013138}}\n\n==Operation==\n[[File:Slovenski izgnanci v usta\u0161kem tabori\u0161\u010du Slavonska Po\u017eega.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Slovenian deportees at the Slavonska Po\u017eega transit camp]]\nCoinciding with Paveli\u0107's visit to see Hitler at the [[Berghof (residence)|Berghof]] on 4 June 1941, Croatian government ministers [[Slavko Kvaternik]] and [[Mladen Lorkovi\u0107]] met with [[Siegfried Kasche]], the German ambassador to Croatia, and [[Harald Turner]], the head of the German civilian administration in German-occupied Serbia, to negotiate the deportation of 180,000 ethnic Serbs living in the NDH to German-occupied Serbia and the simultaneous resettlement of 180,000 [[Slovenes]] to the NDH. The Usta\u0161e wished to alter the ethnic makeup of Serb-majority areas of the NDH and the Germans wished to change the ethnic composition of certain parts of Slovenia. The NDH agreed to admit ethnic Slovenes expelled from German-occupied Slovenia, while simultaneously expelling ethnic Serbs from the NDH to German-occupied Serbia.{{sfn|Duli\u0107|2005|p=96}}\n\nIn July 1941, the Usta\u0161e established a transit camp for Serbs and Slovenes in the town of Slavonska Po\u017eega (modern-day [[Po\u017eega, Croatia]]), {{convert|143|km}} southeast of Zagreb.{{sfn|White|2018|p=75}} The camp's establishment was overseen by the town's police chief, [[Milivoj A\u0161ner]].{{sfn|Zuroff|2009|p=2}} A report submitted to the [[Arolsen Archives - International Center on Nazi Persecution|International Tracing Service]] (ITS) in the 1970s conservatively estimated that nearly 9,500 detainees had passed through the camp during its existence. Since this estimate was based on fragmentary documentation, the historian Joseph Robert White writes that the true number of detainees was probably higher.{{sfn|White|2018|p=75}} It was not uncommon for detainees to be robbed of their belongings, physically abused, and sometimes even killed by escorting Usta\u0161e.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=394}} The campgrounds, which consisted of barracks, a former arms depot and a military vehicle park surrounded by a wall with a barbed-wire fence, had originally been constructed by the [[Royal Yugoslav Army]].

Its establishment was overseen by Slavonska Po\u017eega's police chief, [[Milivoj A\u0161ner]]. The camp was commanded by Captain Ivan Stiper and guarded by the 14th Usta\u0161e Company. The accommodations were insufficient to handle the large number of detainees, leading to severe overcrowding. Detainees were also given inadequate amounts of food, illnesses ran rampant and medical treatment was virtually non-existent. Although it was nominally a transit camp, many detainees were tortured and even killed by the guards. On 26 August, 785 detainees from [[Derventa]] and [[Brod, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosanski Brod]] were shot. The camp was dissolved on 22 October. At least 9,500 detainees passed through it during its existence. The Usta\u0161e administration continued to process belongings that had been stolen from the detainees until mid-November.\n\nIn 2005, prosecutors in Croatia charged A\u0161ner with [[war crimes]] and [[crimes against humanity]] for his role in the deportation of Serbs and [[Jews]] from Slavonska Po\u017eega in 1941 and 1942. [[Austria]], where A\u0161ner was living, refused to extradite him, and he died in 2011 without ever having gone to trial.\n\n==Background==\n===Interwar Yugoslavia===\nEthnic tensions between [[Serbs]] and [[Croats]] increased following the establishment of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes in the aftermath of [[World War I]]. During the [[interwar period]], many Croats came to resent Serb political hegemony in the newly established state, which resulted in the passing of legislation that favoured Serb political, religious and business interests.{{sfn|Mojzes|2011|p=158}} Tensions flared in 1928, following the shooting of five Croatian parliamentary deputies by the Montenegrin Serb politician [[Puni\u0161a Ra\u010di\u0107]]. Two died on the spot and two others were wounded but survived. A fifth, the opposition leader [[Stjepan Radi\u0107]], died nearly two months later of complications attributed to the shooting. In January 1929, King [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Alexander]] instituted a [[6 January Dictatorship|royal dictatorship]] and renamed the country [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. Shortly thereafter, the Croatian politician [[Ante Paveli\u0107]] formed the [[Usta\u0161e]], a [[Croatian nationalism|Croatian nationalist]] and [[fascism|fascist]] movement which sought to achieve Croatian independence through violent means. The Usta\u0161e were outlawed in Yugoslavia, but received covert assistance from [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], which had territorial aspirations over [[Istria]] and [[Dalmatia]]. The Usta\u0161e carried out a number of actions aimed at undermining Yugoslavia, most notably the [[Velebit uprising]] in 1932 and the assassination of King Alexander in [[Marseilles]] in 1934. Following Alexander's assassination, the Usta\u0161e movement's senior-most leaders, including Paveli\u0107, were tried [[trial in absentia|in absentia]] in both France and Yugoslavia and sentenced to death, but were granted protection by Mussolini and thus evaded capture.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|pp=25\u201334}}\n\nFollowing the 1938 ''[[Anschluss]]'' between [[Nazi Germany]] and [[First Austrian Republic|Austria]], Yugoslavia came to share its northwestern border with Germany and fell under increasing pressure as its neighbours aligned themselves with the [[Axis powers]]. In April 1939, Italy opened a second frontier with Yugoslavia when it [[Italian invasion of Albania|invaded]] and occupied neighbouring [[Albanian Kingdom (1928\u201339)|Albania]].{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=6\u20137}} At the outbreak of [[World War II]], the Royal Yugoslav Government declared its [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]].{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2008|p=8}} Between September and November 1940, [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u201346)|Hungary]] and [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] joined the [[Tripartite Pact]], aligning themselves with the Axis, and Italy [[Greco-Italian War|invaded Greece]]. Yugoslavia was by then almost completely surrounded by the Axis powers and their satellites, and its neutral stance toward the war became strained.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=6\u20137}} In late February 1941, [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] joined the Pact. The following day, German troops entered Bulgaria from Romania, closing the ring around Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=12}} Intending to secure his southern flank for the [[Operation Barbarossa|impending attack]] on the [[Soviet Union]], German dictator [[Adolf Hitler]] began placing heavy pressure on Yugoslavia to join the Axis. On 25 March 1941, after some delay, the Royal Yugoslav Government conditionally signed the Pact. Two days later, a group of pro-Western, [[Serbian nationalism|Serbian nationalist]] [[Royal Yugoslav Air Force]] officers deposed the country's [[regent]], [[Prince Paul of Yugoslavia|Prince Paul]], in a bloodless [[Yugoslav coup d'\u00e9tat|coup d'\u00e9tat]].

The government and royal family went into exile, and the country was occupied and dismembered by its neighbours. Hitler wished to irrevocably dismantle Yugoslavia, which he dubbed a \"[[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles]] construct\".{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2008|p=21}} Serbia was reduced to its pre-[[Balkan Wars|Balkan War]] borders, becoming the only country in the Western Balkans to be directly occupied by the Germans.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2008|p=49}} Serb-inhabited territories west of the [[Drina]] River were incorporated into the Axis [[puppet state]] known as the [[Independent State of Croatia]] ({{lang-hr|Nezavisna dr\u017eava Hrvatska}}; NDH), which included most of modern-day [[Croatia]], all of modern-day [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], and parts of modern-day [[Serbia]].{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=272}} The establishment of the NDH had been announced over the radio by [[Slavko Kvaternik]], a former [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] officer who had been in contact with Croatian nationalists abroad, on 10 April.{{sfn|Goldstein|1999|p=133}}{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=155}}\n\nPaveli\u0107 entered the NDH on 13 April and reached [[Zagreb]] two days later.

Paveli\u0107 assumed control and bestowed himself the title ''[[Poglavnik]]'' (\"leader\").{{sfn|Goldstein|1999|p=133}} At the time of its establishment, the NDH had a population of 6.5 million inhabitants, about half of whom were Croats. It was also inhabited by nearly two million Serbs, who constituted about one-third of its total population.{{sfn|Hoare|2007|pp=19\u201320}} Lands inhabited by Serbs accounted for 60\u201370 percent of the NDH's total landmass. Nevertheless, Serbs \u2013 along with others whom the Usta\u0161e deemed \"undesirable\", such as [[Jews]] and [[Romani people|Roma]] \u2013 were denied citizenship on the basis that they were not [[Aryan race|Aryan]]s. Within hours of the NDH's creation, businesses brandished signs reading: \"No Serbs, Gypsies, Jews and dogs\". Additionally, immediate measures were taken to expunge the presence of the [[Cyrillic alphabet]] from the public sphere.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2008|pp=31\u201332}} On 17 April, the Usta\u0161e instituted the Legal Provision for the Defence of the People and State, a law legitimizing the establishment of concentration camps and the mass shooting of hostages in the NDH.

The Usta\u0161e wished to alter the ethnic makeup of Serb-majority areas of the NDH and the Germans wished to change the ethnic composition of certain parts of Slovenia.

She posthumously won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Poetry]] in 1926.\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Houghton MS Lowell 62 (2) - Notman.jpg|thumb|Lowell as a child]] \nAmy Lowell was born on February 9, 1874, in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], the daughter of [[Augustus Lowell]] and Katherine Bigelow Lowell. A member of the [[Boston Brahmin|Brahmin]] [[Lowell family]], her siblings included the astronomer [[Percival Lowell]], the educator and legal scholar [[Abbott Lawrence Lowell]], and [[Elizabeth Lowell Putnam]], an early activist for prenatal care. They were the great-grandchildren of [[John Lowell]] and, on their mother's side, the grandchildren of [[Abbott Lawrence]].<ref>[[Delmar R. Lowell|Lowell, Delmar R.]], ''The Historic Genealogy of the Lowells of America from 1639 to 1899'' (Rutland VT: The Tuttle Company, 1899), 283</ref><ref name=WDL1>{{cite web|title=Chos\u00f6n, the Land of the Morning Calm; a Sketch of Korea|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/2377|publisher=World Digital Library|accessdate=30 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nSchool was a source of considerable despair for the young Amy Lowell. She considered herself to be developing \"masculine\" and \"ugly\" features and she was a social outcast. She had a reputation among her classmates for being outspoken and opinionated.<ref>Horace Gregory, Amy Lowell: Portrait of the Poet in her Own Time, Books for Libraries Press, Freeport, New York, 1958</ref>\n\nLowell never attended college because her family did not consider it proper for a woman to do so.  She compensated for this lack with avid reading and near-obsessive [[book collecting]]. She lived as a socialite and travelled widely, turning to poetry in 1902 (age 28) after being inspired by a performance of [[Eleonora Duse]] in Europe.\n\nLowell was said to be [[lesbian]], and in 1912 she and actress [[Ada Dwyer Russell]] were reputed to be lovers. Russell is reputed to be the subject of Lowell's more erotic works, most notably the love poems contained in 'Two Speak Together', a subsection of ''Pictures of the Floating World''. The two women traveled to England together, where Lowell met [[Ezra Pound]], who at once became a major influence and a major critic of her work.  Pound considered Lowell's embrace of Imagism to be a kind of hijacking of the movement. Lowell has been linked romantically to writer [[Mercedes de Acosta]], but the only evidence of any contact between them is a brief correspondence about a planned memorial for Duse.\n\nLowell was a short but imposing figure who kept her hair in a bun and wore a [[pince-nez]].\n\n[[File:TIME Magazine cover from March 2, 1925 featuring Amy Lowell.jpg|thumb|left|Time Magazine. TIME Magazine cover from March 2, 1925 featuring Amy Lowell]]\n\nLowell publicly smoked cigars, as newspapers of the day frequently mentioned.<ref>Gregory, pg.96</ref> A glandular problem kept her perpetually overweight. Poet [[Witter Bynner]] once said, in a comment frequently misattributed to [[Ezra Pound]], that she was a \"hippopoetess.\"<ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/?id=u5AXdTOuGy4C&pg=PA171&lpg=PA171&dq=%22hippopoetess.%22+Witter+Bynner| page=171| title=Amy Lowell, American modern |author1=Adrienne Munich |author2=Melissa Bradshaw | publisher=Rutgers University Press| year=2004| isbn=978-0-8135-3356-8 }}</ref> Her admirers defended her, however, even after her death. One rebuttal was written by [[Heywood Broun]] in his obituary tribute to Amy. He wrote, \"She was upon the surface of things a Lowell, a New Englander and a spinster. But inside everything was molten like the core of the earth... Given one more gram of emotion, Amy Lowell would have burst into flame and been consumed to cinders.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Amy Lowell 1874-1925|url=http://www.sappho.com/poetry/a_lowell.html|website=Isle of Lesbos|publisher=Alix North}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Grave of Amy Lowell.jpg|thumb|Grave of Amy Lowell in [[Mount Auburn Cemetery]] in Cambridge, Massachusetts]]\n\nLowell died of a [[cerebral hemorrhage]] in 1925, at the age of 51 and is buried at [[Mount Auburn Cemetery]].<ref>Wilson, Scott. ''Resting Places: The Burial Sites of More Than 14,000 Famous Persons'', 3d ed.: 2 (Kindle Location 28784). McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers. Kindle Edition</ref> The following year, she was awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize for Poetry]] for ''What's O'Clock''.  That collection included the patriotic poem \"Lilacs\", which [[Louis Untermeyer]] said was the poem of hers he liked best.\n\nHer first published work appeared in 1910 in ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]''. The first published collection of her poetry, ''A Dome of Many-Coloured Glass'', appeared two years later, in 1912. An additional group of uncollected poems was added to the volume ''The Complete Poetical Works of Amy Lowell'', published in 1955 with an introduction by [[Louis Untermeyer]], who considered himself her friend.\n\nThough she sometimes wrote sonnets, Lowell was an early adherent to the \"[[free verse]]\" method of poetry and one of the major champions of this method. She defined it in her preface to \"Sword Blades and Poppy Seed\"; in the North American Review for January, 1917; in the closing chapter of \"Tendencies in Modern American Poetry\"; and also in the Dial (January 17, 1918), as:  \"The definition of [[Vers libre]] is: a verse-formal based upon cadence.  To understand vers libre, one must abandon all desire to find in it the even rhythm of metrical feet. One must allow the lines to flow as they will when read aloud by an intelligent reader. Or, to put it another way, unrhymed [[Cadence (poetry)|cadence]] is \"built upon 'organic rhythm,' or the rhythm of the speaking voice with its necessity for breathing, rather than upon a strict metrical system.  Free verse within its own law of [[Cadence (poetry)|cadence]] has no absolute rules; it would not be 'free' if it had.\"<ref>Lowes, Livingston John Conventions and Revolt in Poetry, 1919</ref>\n\nUntermeyer writes that \"[s]he was not only a disturber but an awakener.\"<ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/?id=N0AtxcoLkC8C&pg=PA77&lpg=PA77&dq=Untermeyer+She+was+not+only+a+disturber+but+an+awakener| page=77| title=Modern American poetry, 1865-1950 |author1=Alan Shucard |author2=Fred Moramarco |author3=William Sullivan | publisher=University of Massachusetts Press| year=1990| isbn=978-0-87023-720-1 }}</ref> In many poems, Lowell dispenses with line breaks, so that the work looks like prose on the page. This technique she labeled \"polyphonic prose\".<ref>{{cite book| url=https://archive.org/details/americanprosepoe00delv| url-access=registration| quote=lowell polyphonic prose.| title=The American prose poem | author=Michel Delville| page=[https://archive.org/details/americanprosepoe00delv/page/6 6]| publisher=University Press of Florida| year=1998| isbn=978-0-8130-1591-0 }}</ref>\n\nThroughout her working life, Lowell was a promoter of both contemporary and historical poets. Her book ''Fir-Flower Poets'' was a poetical re-working of literal translations of the works of ancient Chinese poets, notably [[Li Tai-po]] (A.D. 701-762).  Her writing also included critical works on French literature.  At the time of her death, she was attempting to complete her two-volume biography of [[John Keats]]\n(work on which had long been frustrated by the noncooperation of [[F. Holland Day]], whose private collection of Keatsiana included [[Fanny Brawne]]'s letters to Frances Keats).\nLowell wrote of Keats: \"the stigma of oddness is the price a myopic world always exacts of genius.\"<ref>{{cite book| url=https://archive.org/stream/johnkeatsvolumei009666mbp/johnkeatsvolumei009666mbp_djvu.txt| title=John Keats| author=Amy Lowell| volume=II| publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company | year=1925 | page=152}}</ref>\n\nLowell not only published her own work, but also that of other writers. According to Untermeyer, she \"captured\" the Imagist movement from [[Ezra Pound]].  Pound threatened to sue her for bringing out her three-volume series ''Some Imagist Poets'', and thereafter derisively called the American Imagists the \"Amygist\" movement. Pound criticized her as not an imagist, but merely a rich woman who was able to financially assist the publication of imagist poetry.

She posthumously won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Poetry]] in 1926.\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Houghton MS Lowell 62 (2) - Notman.jpg|thumb|Lowell as a child]] \nAmy Lowell was born on February 9, 1874, in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], the daughter of [[Augustus Lowell]] and Katherine Bigelow Lowell. A member of the [[Boston Brahmin|Brahmin]] [[Lowell family]], her siblings included the astronomer [[Percival Lowell]], the educator and legal scholar [[Abbott Lawrence Lowell]], and [[Elizabeth Lowell Putnam]], an early activist for prenatal care. They were the great-grandchildren of [[John Lowell]] and, on their mother's side, the grandchildren of [[Abbott Lawrence]].<ref>[[Delmar R. Lowell|Lowell, Delmar R.]], ''The Historic Genealogy of the Lowells of America from 1639 to 1899'' (Rutland VT: The Tuttle Company, 1899), 283</ref><ref name=WDL1>{{cite web|title=Chos\u00f6n, the Land of the Morning Calm; a Sketch of Korea|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/2377|publisher=World Digital Library|accessdate=30 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nSchool was a source of considerable despair for the young Amy Lowell. She considered herself to be developing \"masculine\" and \"ugly\" features and she was a social outcast. She had a reputation among her classmates for being outspoken and opinionated.<ref>Horace Gregory, Amy Lowell: Portrait of the Poet in her Own Time, Books for Libraries Press, Freeport, New York, 1958</ref>\n\nLowell never attended college because her family did not consider it proper for a woman to do so.  She compensated for this lack with avid reading and near-obsessive [[book collecting]]. She lived as a socialite and travelled widely, turning to poetry in 1902 (age 28) after being inspired by a performance of [[Eleonora Duse]] in Europe.\n\nLowell was said to be [[lesbian]], and in 1912 she and actress [[Ada Dwyer Russell]] were reputed to be lovers. Russell is reputed to be the subject of Lowell's more erotic works, most notably the love poems contained in 'Two Speak Together', a subsection of ''Pictures of the Floating World''. The two women traveled to England together, where Lowell met [[Ezra Pound]], who at once became a major influence and a major critic of her work.  Pound considered Lowell's embrace of Imagism to be a kind of hijacking of the movement. Lowell has been linked romantically to writer [[Mercedes de Acosta]], but the only evidence of any contact between them is a brief correspondence about a planned memorial for Duse.\n\nLowell was a short but imposing figure who kept her hair in a bun and wore a [[pince-nez]].\n\n[[File:TIME Magazine cover from March 2, 1925 featuring Amy Lowell.jpg|thumb|left|Time Magazine. TIME Magazine cover from March 2, 1925 featuring Amy Lowell]]\n\nLowell smoked cigars constantly, as newspapers of the day frequently mentioned.<ref>Gregory, pg.96</ref> A glandular problem kept her perpetually overweight, so that poet [[Witter Bynner]] once said, in a cruel comment repeated by [[Ezra Pound]] and thereafter commonly misattributed to him, that she was a \"hippopoetess.\"<ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/?id=u5AXdTOuGy4C&pg=PA171&lpg=PA171&dq=%22hippopoetess.%22+Witter+Bynner| page=171| title=Amy Lowell, American modern |author1=Adrienne Munich |author2=Melissa Bradshaw | publisher=Rutgers University Press| year=2004| isbn=978-0-8135-3356-8 }}</ref> Her admirers defended her, however, even after her death. One rebuttal was written by [[Heywood Broun]] in his obituary tribute to Amy. He wrote, \"She was upon the surface of things a Lowell, a New Englander and a spinster. But inside everything was molten like the core of the earth... Given one more gram of emotion, Amy Lowell would have burst into flame and been consumed to cinders.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Amy Lowell 1874-1925|url=http://www.sappho.com/poetry/a_lowell.html|website=Isle of Lesbos|publisher=Alix North}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Grave of Amy Lowell.jpg|thumb|Grave of Amy Lowell in [[Mount Auburn Cemetery]] in Cambridge, Massachusetts]]\n\nLowell died of a [[cerebral hemorrhage]] in 1925, at the age of 51 and is buried at [[Mount Auburn Cemetery]].<ref>Wilson, Scott. ''Resting Places: The Burial Sites of More Than 14,000 Famous Persons'', 3d ed.: 2 (Kindle Location 28784). McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers. Kindle Edition</ref> The following year, she was awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize for Poetry]] for ''What's O'Clock''.  That collection included the patriotic poem \"Lilacs\", which [[Louis Untermeyer]] said was the poem of hers he liked best.\n\nHer first published work appeared in 1910 in ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]''. The first published collection of her poetry, ''A Dome of Many-Coloured Glass'', appeared two years later, in 1912. An additional group of uncollected poems was added to the volume ''The Complete Poetical Works of Amy Lowell'', published in 1955 with an introduction by [[Louis Untermeyer]], who considered himself her friend.\n\nThough she sometimes wrote sonnets, Lowell was an early adherent to the \"[[free verse]]\" method of poetry and one of the major champions of this method. She defined it in her preface to \"Sword Blades and Poppy Seed\"; in the North American Review for January, 1917; in the closing chapter of \"Tendencies in Modern American Poetry\"; and also in the Dial (January 17, 1918), as:  \"The definition of [[Vers libre]] is: a verse-formal based upon cadence.  To understand vers libre, one must abandon all desire to find in it the even rhythm of metrical feet. One must allow the lines to flow as they will when read aloud by an intelligent reader. Or, to put it another way, unrhymed [[Cadence (poetry)|cadence]] is \"built upon 'organic rhythm,' or the rhythm of the speaking voice with its necessity for breathing, rather than upon a strict metrical system.  Free verse within its own law of [[Cadence (poetry)|cadence]] has no absolute rules; it would not be 'free' if it had.\"<ref>Lowes, Livingston John Conventions and Revolt in Poetry, 1919</ref>\n\nUntermeyer writes that \"[s]he was not only a disturber but an awakener.\"<ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/?id=N0AtxcoLkC8C&pg=PA77&lpg=PA77&dq=Untermeyer+She+was+not+only+a+disturber+but+an+awakener| page=77| title=Modern American poetry, 1865-1950 |author1=Alan Shucard |author2=Fred Moramarco |author3=William Sullivan | publisher=University of Massachusetts Press| year=1990| isbn=978-0-87023-720-1 }}</ref> In many poems, Lowell dispenses with line breaks, so that the work looks like prose on the page. This technique she labeled \"polyphonic prose\".<ref>{{cite book| url=https://archive.org/details/americanprosepoe00delv| url-access=registration| quote=lowell polyphonic prose.| title=The American prose poem | author=Michel Delville| page=[https://archive.org/details/americanprosepoe00delv/page/6 6]| publisher=University Press of Florida| year=1998| isbn=978-0-8130-1591-0 }}</ref>\n\nThroughout her working life, Lowell was a promoter of both contemporary and historical poets. Her book ''Fir-Flower Poets'' was a poetical re-working of literal translations of the works of ancient Chinese poets, notably [[Li Tai-po]] (A.D. 701-762).  Her writing also included critical works on French literature.  At the time of her death, she was attempting to complete her two-volume biography of [[John Keats]]\n(work on which had long been frustrated by the noncooperation of [[F. Holland Day]], whose private collection of Keatsiana included [[Fanny Brawne]]'s letters to Frances Keats).\nLowell wrote of Keats: \"the stigma of oddness is the price a myopic world always exacts of genius.\"<ref>{{cite book| url=https://archive.org/stream/johnkeatsvolumei009666mbp/johnkeatsvolumei009666mbp_djvu.txt| title=John Keats| author=Amy Lowell| volume=II| publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company | year=1925 | page=152}}</ref>\n\nLowell not only published her own work, but also that of other writers. According to Untermeyer, she \"captured\" the Imagist movement from [[Ezra Pound]].  Pound threatened to sue her for bringing out her three-volume series ''Some Imagist Poets'', and thereafter derisively called the American Imagists the \"Amygist\" movement. Pound criticized her as not an imagist, but merely a rich woman who was able to financially assist the publication of imagist poetry.

Hawaii Wildlife Fund''''', No. 18-260, was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case involving pollution discharges under the [[Clean Water Act]], specifically whether pollution from a point of discharge into a [[groundwater]] source that can potentially reach navigable waterways must be regulated, decided in 2020. In a 6-3 decision, the Court ruled that such discharges into groundwater sources may potentially require permits as they may be the \"functional equivalent of a direct discharge\", a new test defined by the ruling consistent with the intent of the Act, and on vacating and remanding the case to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]], instructed the court to work with the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) to establish additional guidance on such sources.\n\n==Background==\nThe Clean Water Act (CWA), enacted in 1972 as the ''Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972,''<ref>United States. Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972. {{USPL|92|500)}}. October 18, 1972.</ref> regulates water pollution into \"waters of the United States.\"<ref>Clean Water Act (CWA) sec. 301(a), {{USC|33|1311}}.</ref> One of its provisions involves the regulation of pollutants from [[point source]]s (such as the drainage from an industrial plant) into [[surface water]]s. Operators of any point source are required to obtain a permit through the [[National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System]] (NPDES) that limits what pollutants may be emitted by the point source, necessary treatment steps to take to limit those pollutants, and other considerations.<ref>CWA sec. 402, {{USC|33|1342}}.</ref>\n\nIt is unclear whether the Act covers discharges into waters of the U.S. through [[groundwater]]. A plain reading of the statute indicates that it does, \"The term \"discharge of a pollutant\" and the term \"discharge of pollutants\" each means (A) any addition of any pollutant to navigable waters from any point source, (B) any addition of any pollutant to the waters of the contiguous zone or the ocean from any point source other than a vessel or other floating craft.\"<ref>CWA sec. 502, {{USC|33|1362}}.</ref> Whether the CWA covers fairly traceable discharges through groundwater into navigable waters of the U.S. is the fundamental question of the ''Maui v. Hawaii Wildlife Fund'' appeal pending before the United States Supreme Court.\n\nThe [[Safe Drinking Water Act]] (SDWA) directly regulates discharges into groundwater aquifers, such as through [[injection well]]s, and additional regulations set by each state. The EPA still regulates the type of wastewater that can be injected through the [[Safe Drinking Water Act#Underground Injection Control (UIC) Program|Underground Injection Control (UIC) Program]], but broadly, the UIC Program allows much higher levels of pollutants to be injected compared to the NPDES, due to the natural filtration action that occurs in groundwater aquifers. Of particular interest to the case are Class V UIC wells\u2014wells used to dispose of non-hazardous water waste into underground aquifers. Typically these will include [[stormwater]] drainage or [[surface runoff|agricultural runoff]]. The EPA estimates there are 650,000 such Class V wells in place across the United States.<ref>{{cite web |title=Basic Information About Class V Injection Wells |url=https://www.epa.gov/uic/basic-information-about-class-v-injection-wells |date=2016-09-06 |website=Underground Injection Control |publisher=EPA}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Lahaina_WWTP_map.jpg|thumb|upright|Map of the northwestern shore of the island of Maui, highlighting the location of the Lahaina Wastewater Reclamation Facility and its proximity to the shoreline]]\nIn the present case, the Lahaina Wastewater Reclamation Facility in [[Maui County, Hawaii]] treats wastewater from homes and businesses. The facility is authorized by the EPA and the [[Hawaii Department of Health]] under the SDWA to inject the [[reclaimed water]] into four Class V wells on the island, with an average total effluent of {{convert|3|-|5|USgal|l|disp=preunit|million }} per day.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://19january2017snapshot.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-11/documents/lahaina-stmt-of-basis.pdf |title=Statement of Basis for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region IX, Class V Underground Injection Control Permit # HI50710003, Maui County, Department of Environmental Management |date=November 2015 |accessdate=February 21, 2019 |publisher=EPA |location=San Francisco, CA}}</ref> Because of the geologic nature of Hawaii, it is estimated that more than 90% of this water eventually enters the surrounding ocean through seepage. During the planning and subsequent reviews of the facility, both the EPA and the state had determined that there was no need for the facility to apply for a NPDES permit, since it was not a point source under the CWA. However, tracer dye studies have proven that injections of wastewater from the Lahaina facility are reaching nearby ocean waters via groundwater, and piezometer studies have indicated heightened levels of nutrients at the site.\n\nIn April 2019, after the trial court and appellate court decisions, the EPA issued a new guidance document asserting that the CWA does not cover such discharges. This document is not binding on the Supreme Court.<ref>{{cite web| title=Releases from a Point Source to Groundwater |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/releases-point-source-groundwater |date=2019-04-23 |website=National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C.}}</ref>\n\n==Trial court==\nIn 2012, several environmental activist groups, including the Hawaii Wildlife Fund, the [[Surfrider Foundation]], the [[Sierra Club]]-Maui Group, and the West Maui Preservation Association, represented by [[Earthjustice]], sued the county for lacking appropriate NPDES permits, arguing that their injection wells were truly point sources since past EPA studies using dye tracers had shown it possible to trace the discharge from individual wells into the ocean.<ref name=\"maui now epa\"/> Reclaimed water, which can possess higher levels of bacteria and other microorganisms, that seeped into the ocean led to the spread of [[algal bloom]]s near Maui's shores and could impact the health of coral reefs, aquatic and mammalian life, and humans that live near the shore, according to the environmental groups.<ref name=\"maui en banc\"/> The County disputed this with support of the EPA, stating that the wells were not a direct point source defined from the CWA.<ref name=\"maui now epa\">{{cite web |url =http://mauinow.com/2016/06/08/epa-weighs-in-on-lahaina-injection-wells-in-west-maui/ |title=EPA Weighs in on Lahaina Injection Wells in West Maui |first=Wendy |last=Osher |date=June 8, 2016 |accessdate=February 21, 2019 |work=Maui Now}}</ref> The suit was filed after the environmental groups plead with the county on civil grounds to seek an NPDES permit in the years prior.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://earthjustice.org/news/press/2011/community-groups-to-sue-maui-county-for-discharging-polluted-wastewater |title=Community Groups to Sue Maui County for Discharging Polluted Wastewater |date=June 29, 2011 |accessdate=February 21, 2019 |publisher=[[Earthjustice]]}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014 the [[United States District Court for the District of Hawaii]] found for the plaintiffs, agreeing that the facility needed NPDES permits for the injection wells and for the facility itself.<ref>{{cite court |litigants=Haw.

Miccosukee Tribe|volume=541|page=95|pin=|year=2004}}.</ref> and upheld in several subsequent cases. The County also raised concerns that this test would affect a significant portion of the other 650,000 Class V wells in operation, requiring these wells to also obtain NPDES permits. The County also referred to the Supreme Court's decision in ''[[Michigan v. EPA]]'' (2015), which stated the EPA failed to consider the costs necessary in what it considered a \"necessary and appropriate\" rule-making change to enforcement of the [[Clear Air Act]] that affected the nation's power plants.<ref>{{ussc|name=Michigan v.

In his opinion, Breyer wrote that the test that the Ninth Circuit had adopted would give the EPA greater authority on pollutant regulation than Congress had given at the time, as the Ninth Circuit's test could apply to a source of pollution that may have occurred a century before and hundreds of miles away due to the slow motion of groundwater. However, the decision also outright rejected the County of Maui's argument that the discharge in the present case did not need a permit, as the language of the CWA as intended by Congress would cover the types of discharge. In the decision, Breyer asserted that a permit for discharge would be required for point sources, or for \"the functional equivalent of a direct discharge\", which had been demonstrated in the present case. Breyer instructed the Ninth on remand to consider the \"functional equivalent\" test, in guidance with the EPA, to re-evaluate the discharge from the Lahaina Wastewater Reclamation Facility and for similar cases going forward, barring a change in the CWA statute. This would thus determine if the original case brought by the Hawaii Wildlife Fund could then proceed. In his concurring opinion, Kavanaugh stressed that the majority opinion was consistent with the plurality decision from ''[[Rapanos v. United States]]'' (2006).\n\nJustice [[Clarence Thomas]] wrote a dissent joined by Justice [[Neil Gorsuch]]. Thomas took the stance that the CWA was more restrictive and only required a permit from a true direct discharge source, and would have reversed the Ninth Circuit's decision in favor of the County of Maui. Justice [[Samuel Alito]] also wrote a dissent, more critical of the majority opinion setting a new standard for determining the need for a permit, but would have reversed the Ninth's decision.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:United States Supreme Court cases]]\n[[Category:Water law in the United States]]\n[[Category:Water pollution in the United States]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox SCOTUS case\n  |Litigants=County of Maui v.

Hawaii Wildlife Fund''''', No. 18-260, was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case involving pollution discharges under the [[Clean Water Act]], specifically whether pollution from a point of discharge into a [[groundwater]] source that can potentially reach navigable waterways must be regulated, decided in 2020. In a 6-3 decision, the Court ruled that such discharges into groundwater sources may potentially require permits as they may be the \"functional equivalent of a direct discharge\", a new test defined by the ruling consistent with the intent of the Act, and on vacating and remanding the case to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]], instructed the court to work with the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) to establish additional guidance on such sources.\n\n==Background==\nThe Clean Water Act (CWA), enacted in 1972 as the ''Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972,''<ref>United States. Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972. {{USPL|92|500)}}. October 18, 1972.</ref> regulates water pollution into \"waters of the United States.\"<ref>Clean Water Act (CWA) sec. 301(a), {{USC|33|1311}}.</ref> One of its provisions involves the regulation of pollutants from [[point source]]s (such as the drainage from an industrial plant) into [[surface water]]s. Operators of any point source are required to obtain a permit through the [[National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System]] (NPDES) that limits what pollutants may be emitted by the point source, necessary treatment steps to take to limit those pollutants, and other considerations.<ref>CWA sec. 402, {{USC|33|1342}}.</ref>\n\nIt is unclear whether the Act covers discharges into waters of the U.S. through [[groundwater]]. A plain reading of the statute indicates that it does, \"The term \"discharge of a pollutant\" and the term \"discharge of pollutants\" each means (A) any addition of any pollutant to navigable waters from any point source, (B) any addition of any pollutant to the waters of the contiguous zone or the ocean from any point source other than a vessel or other floating craft.\"<ref>CWA sec. 502, {{USC|33|1362}}.</ref> Whether the CWA covers fairly traceable discharges through groundwater into navigable waters of the U.S. is the fundamental question of the ''Maui v. Hawaii Wildlife Fund'' appeal pending before the United States Supreme Court.\n\nThe [[Safe Drinking Water Act]] (SDWA) directly regulates discharges into groundwater aquifers, such as through [[injection well]]s, and additional regulations set by each state. The EPA still regulates the type of wastewater that can be injected through the [[Safe Drinking Water Act#Underground Injection Control (UIC) Program|Underground Injection Control (UIC) Program]], but broadly, the UIC Program allows much higher levels of pollutants to be injected compared to the NPDES, due to the natural filtration action that occurs in groundwater aquifers. Of particular interest to the case are Class V UIC wells\u2014wells used to dispose of non-hazardous water waste into underground aquifers. Typically these will include [[stormwater]] drainage or [[surface runoff|agricultural runoff]]. The EPA estimates there are 650,000 such Class V wells in place across the United States.<ref>{{cite web |title=Basic Information About Class V Injection Wells |url=https://www.epa.gov/uic/basic-information-about-class-v-injection-wells |date=2016-09-06 |website=Underground Injection Control |publisher=EPA}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Lahaina_WWTP_map.jpg|thumb|upright|Map of the northwestern shore of the island of Maui, highlighting the location of the Lahaina Wastewater Reclamation Facility and its proximity to the shoreline]]\nIn the present case, the Lahaina Wastewater Reclamation Facility in [[Maui County, Hawaii]] treats wastewater from homes and businesses. The facility is authorized by the EPA and the [[Hawaii Department of Health]] under the SDWA to inject the [[reclaimed water]] into four Class V wells on the island, with an average total effluent of {{convert|3|-|5|USgal|l|disp=preunit|million }} per day.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://19january2017snapshot.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-11/documents/lahaina-stmt-of-basis.pdf |title=Statement of Basis for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region IX, Class V Underground Injection Control Permit # HI50710003, Maui County, Department of Environmental Management |date=November 2015 |accessdate=February 21, 2019 |publisher=EPA |location=San Francisco, CA}}</ref> Because of the geologic nature of Hawaii, it is estimated that more than 90% of this water eventually enters the surrounding ocean through seepage. During the planning and subsequent reviews of the facility, both the EPA and the state had determined that there was no need for the facility to apply for a NPDES permit, since it was not a point source under the CWA. However, tracer dye studies have proven that injections of wastewater from the Lahaina facility are reaching nearby ocean waters via groundwater, and piezometer studies have indicated heightened levels of nutrients at the site.\n\nIn April 2019, after the trial court and appellate court decisions, the EPA issued a new guidance document asserting that the CWA does not cover such discharges. This document is not binding on the Supreme Court.<ref>{{cite web| title=Releases from a Point Source to Groundwater |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/releases-point-source-groundwater |date=2019-04-23 |website=National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C.}}</ref>\n\n==Trial court==\nIn 2012, several environmental activist groups, including the Hawaii Wildlife Fund, the [[Surfrider Foundation]], the [[Sierra Club]]-Maui Group, and the West Maui Preservation Association, represented by [[Earthjustice]], sued the county for lacking appropriate NPDES permits, arguing that their injection wells were truly point sources since past EPA studies using dye tracers had shown it possible to trace the discharge from individual wells into the ocean.<ref name=\"maui now epa\"/> Reclaimed water, which can possess higher levels of bacteria and other microorganisms, that seeped into the ocean led to the spread of [[algal bloom]]s near Maui's shores and could impact the health of coral reefs, aquatic and mammalian life, and humans that live near the shore, according to the environmental groups.<ref name=\"maui en banc\"/> The County disputed this with support of the EPA, stating that the wells were not a direct point source defined from the CWA.<ref name=\"maui now epa\">{{cite web |url =http://mauinow.com/2016/06/08/epa-weighs-in-on-lahaina-injection-wells-in-west-maui/ |title=EPA Weighs in on Lahaina Injection Wells in West Maui |first=Wendy |last=Osher |date=June 8, 2016 |accessdate=February 21, 2019 |work=Maui Now}}</ref> The suit was filed after the environmental groups plead with the county on civil grounds to seek an NPDES permit in the years prior.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://earthjustice.org/news/press/2011/community-groups-to-sue-maui-county-for-discharging-polluted-wastewater |title=Community Groups to Sue Maui County for Discharging Polluted Wastewater |date=June 29, 2011 |accessdate=February 21, 2019 |publisher=[[Earthjustice]]}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014 the [[United States District Court for the District of Hawaii]] found for the plaintiffs, agreeing that the facility needed NPDES permits for the injection wells and for the facility itself.<ref>{{cite court |litigants=Haw.

The County also raised concerns that this test would affect a significant portion of the other 650,000 Class V wells in operation, requiring these wells to also obtain NPDES permits. The County also referred to the Supreme Court's decision in ''[[Michigan v.

With the promulgation of the [[Constitution of Pakistan of 1956|first]] [[Constitution of Pakistan|Constitution]], Pakistan became an [[Islamic republic]] in 1956, and the Governor-General was replaced with the presidency. The incumbent Governor-General, [[Iskander Mirza]], became Pakistan's first president. He reportedly [[1958 Pakistani coup d'\u00e9tat|suspended the]] first Constitution in 1958, and appointed [[Commander-in-Chief of the Pakistan Army|Army Commander-in-Chief]] General [[Ayub Khan (President of Pakistan)|Ayub Khan]] as the first [[Chief Martial Law Administrator|chief martial law administrator]]. Khan subsequently dismissed Mirza in order to become the president.\n[[File:Iskander Mirza.jpg|thumb|223x223px|[[Iskander Mirza]] became the 1st President of Pakistan in 1956. ]]\nThe [[Constitution of Pakistan of 1962|second]] Constitution introduced by President Ayub Khan turned the country into a [[presidential republic]] without [[Elections in Pakistan|direct elections]]. Succumbing to internal and international pressure, however, Khan held a nationwide [[1965 Pakistani presidential election|presidential election]] in 1965. Khan successfully campaigned against his opponent, [[Fatima Jinnah]], for a second term, but some have alleged that elections were rigged in favour of Khan.\n\n[[File:Presidential standard of Pakistan (1974\u20131998).svg|thumb|left|200px|Presidential standard (1974\u20131998)]]\nControversy regarding the [[1960 U-2 incident|U-2 incident]] (1960), [[Privatisation in Pakistan|privatization]] (1963), and [[Indo-Pakistani war of 1965|war]] with [[India]] (1965), fueled a fierce [[Socialism in Pakistan|left-wing]] opposition movement led by [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] of the [[Pakistan Peoples Party|PPP]] and [[Bengali nationalism|Bengali nationalist]] [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]] who, with the support of demonstrators, aimed to further weaken the presidency. Suffering from [[paralysis]] and declining health, Ayub Khan handed over the presidency to army chief General [[Yahya Khan]], [[Legal Framework Order, 1970|who imposed martial law]] and announced that nationwide elections would be held in 1970. Eventually, [[1970 Pakistani general election|general elections]] were held in 1970 which saw the [[Pakistan Peoples Party|PPP]] gaining a majority of seats in West Pakistan (current day Pakistan) and the [[Awami League]] gaining a majority in [[East Pakistan]] (current day Bangladesh).\n\nAfter he was unable to reach a compromise between the PPP and the Awami League, President Yahya Khan invited [[Nurul Amin]] of the [[Pakistan Muslim League]] to become the [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]], and also appointed him as the first [[Vice President of Pakistan|Vice President]]. The growing instigated violence against [[Pakistanis]] in East Pakistan forced President Yahya Khan to use [[Operation Searchlight|force]] in order to maintain [[Law and order (politics)|order]] there, which further escalated [[Bangladesh Liberation War|Bengali resistance]] (1970).  [[Operation Chengiz Khan|Preemptive strikes]] against [[India]] led to another [[Indo-Pakistani war of 1971|war]] in 1971, which [[Independence of Bangladesh|freed]] [[East Pakistan]] and created [[Bangladesh]].\n\nTaking personal responsibility for the political isolation and devastation of [[Pakistan]] after the [[Fall of Dhaka|fall]] of [[East Pakistan]], President Yahya Khan stepped down and ceded power to [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]]. President Bhutto created the current [[Constitution of Pakistan]] in 1973, transforming [[Pakistan]] into a [[parliamentary democracy]], and reducing presidential powers to that of a ceremonial [[figurehead]].\n\n===Past Interventions===\nThe [[1977 Pakistani general election|general elections]] held in 1977 resulted in an atmosphere of civil unrest instigated by the [[Conservatism in Pakistan|right-wing]] alliance, the [[Pakistan National Alliance]]. The events leading to it resulted in [[Operation Fair Play|military intervention]] by [[Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan)|chief of army staff]] General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]] and [[Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee|Chairman Joint Chiefs]] Admiral [[Mohammad Shariff]]. Suspending the [[Constitution of Pakistan|Constitution]] in 1977, General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]] took over the presidency in 1978. Zia's [[Zia regime|presidency]] oversaw the modern growth of [[Islamic fundamentalism|far-right ideas]] in the country. Succumbing to domestic pressure to restore the [[Constitution of Pakistan|Constitution]], President [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]] held a [[1984 Pakistani Islamisation programme referendum|referendum]] (1984) and called for [[1985 Pakistani general election|general elections]] in 1985. President [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]] appointed [[Mohammad Khan Junejo|Mohammad Junejo]] as [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] and assumed more [[Political power|powers]] through the [[Eighth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan|constitutional amendment]]. After dismissing [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Mohammad Khan Junejo|Junejo]], President [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]] announced that new [[1988 Pakistani general election|general elections]] would be held, but President [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia]] [[Death of Zia-ul-Haq|died in a plane crash]] in 1988.\n\nThe [[1988 Pakistani general election|general elections]] held in 1988 witnessed the victory of [[Pakistan Peoples Party|PPP]] in 1988, and appointed [[Chairman Senate]] [[Ghulam Ishaq Khan]] to the presidency. Conflict between [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Benazir Bhutto]] and President [[Ghulam Ishaq Khan]] arose in two areas regarding the issues of appointments. President [[Ghulam Ishaq Khan]] repeatedly intervened in government matters and [[Corruption charges against Benazir Bhutto and Asif Ali Zardari|leveled charges]] against [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Benazir Bhutto]]; thus [[Eighth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan|dismissing]] [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Benazir Bhutto]] in 1990. After holding [[1988 Pakistani general election|general elections]] in 1990, [[Nawaz Sharif]] brought up an ideologically [[First Sharif ministry|conservative government]] and President [[Ghulam Ishaq Khan]] unsuccessfully tried to dismiss Sharif. After a successful intervention by [[Supreme Court of Pakistan|Supreme Court]] and [[Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee|Chairman Joint Chiefs]] General [[Shamim Alam Khan|Shamim Allam]], President [[Ghulam Ishaq Khan]] and Prime Minister [[Nawaz Sharif]] tendered resignations in 1993.\n\nFollowing the [[1993 Pakistani general election|new elections]] held in 1993, [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Benazir Bhutto]] established a strong government after appointing loyalist [[Farooq Leghari]] to the presidency. However, the [[Corruption charges against Benazir Bhutto and Asif Ali Zardari|corruption charges]] and the controversial death of [[Murtaza Bhutto]] in 1996 resulted in President [[Farooq Leghari]] [[Eighth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan|dismissing]] [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Benazir Bhutto]]. In 1997, President [[Farooq Leghari]] could not overcome the heavy mandate bestowed on Prime Minister [[Nawaz Sharif]] by the public in [[1997 Pakistani general election|1997]].  President [[Farooq Leghari|Leghari]] unsuccessfully supported [[Chief Justice of Pakistan|Chief Justice]] [[Sajjad Ali Shah]]\u2014 both of them resigned, ending the conflict between the [[Judiciary of Pakistan|Judiciary]], the [[Prime Minister's Secretariat (Pakistan)|Executive]], and the [[Parliament of Pakistan|Parliament]]. After appointing [[Rafiq Tarar]], the [[Parliament of Pakistan|Parliament]] successfully passed [[Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan|constitutional amendment]] to decisively limit the presidency. After staging a controversial [[1999 Pakistani coup d'\u00e9tat|self coup]] in 1999, General [[Pervez Musharraf]] dismissed Prime Minister [[Nawaz Sharif]] and President [[Rafiq Tarar]] in 2001 while assuming more [[Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan|powers to the presidency]].  In January 2004, the [[Electoral College of Pakistan|Electoral College]] [[2004 Pakistani presidential election|elected]] Musharraf, and as a result he was, according to the Constitution, \"deemed to be elected\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Waldman|first=Amy|title=Pakistan Gives Musharraf Confidence Vote as President|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/02/international/asia/02STAN.html?ex=1388379600&en=a5ffeee2a4e1367a&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND|newspaper=New York Times|date=January 2, 2004|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515004758/http://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/02/international/asia/02STAN.html?ex=1388379600&en=a5ffeee2a4e1367a&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND|archivedate=May 15, 2013}}</ref>\n\nPresident Musharraf's repeated unconstitutional intervention resulted in a standoff with the [[Judiciary of Pakistan|Judiciary]], and declared a [[2007 Pakistani martial law|state of emergency]] in 2007, after dismissing the [[List of Justices of Supreme Court of Pakistan|senior justices]] of the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan|Supreme Court]].

With the promulgation of the [[Constitution of Pakistan of 1956|first]] [[Constitution of Pakistan|Constitution]], Pakistan became an [[Islamic republic]] in 1956, and the Governor-General was replaced with the presidency. The incumbent Governor-General, [[Iskander Mirza]], became Pakistan's first president. He reportedly [[1958 Pakistani coup d'\u00e9tat|suspended the]] first Constitution in 1958, and appointed [[Commander-in-Chief of the Pakistan Army|Army Commander-in-Chief]] General [[Ayub Khan (President of Pakistan)|Ayub Khan]] as the first [[Chief Martial Law Administrator|chief martial law administrator]]. Khan subsequently dismissed Mirza in order to become the president.\n[[File:Iskander Mirza.jpg|thumb|223x223px|[[Iskander Mirza]] became the 1st President of Pakistan in 1956. ]]\nThe [[Constitution of Pakistan of 1962|second]] Constitution introduced by President Ayub Khan turned the country into a [[presidential republic]] without [[Elections in Pakistan|direct elections]]. Succumbing to internal and international pressure, however, Khan held a nationwide [[1965 Pakistani presidential election|presidential election]] in 1965. Khan successfully campaigned against his opponent, [[Fatima Jinnah]], for a second term, but some have alleged that elections were rigged in favour of Khan.\n\n[[File:Presidential standard of Pakistan (1974\u20131998).svg|thumb|left|200px|Presidential standard (1974\u20131998)]]\nControversy regarding the [[1960 U-2 incident|U-2 incident]] (1960), [[Privatisation in Pakistan|privatization]] (1963), and [[Indo-Pakistani war of 1965|war]] with [[India]] (1965), fueled a fierce [[Socialism in Pakistan|left-wing]] opposition movement led by [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] of the [[Pakistan Peoples Party|PPP]] and [[Bengali nationalism|Bengali nationalist]] [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]] who, with the support of demonstrators, aimed to further weaken the presidency. Suffering from [[paralysis]] and declining health, Ayub Khan handed over the presidency to army chief General [[Yahya Khan]], [[Legal Framework Order, 1970|who imposed martial law]] and announced that nationwide elections would be held in 1970. Eventually, [[1970 Pakistani general election|general elections]] were held in 1970 which saw the [[Pakistan Peoples Party|PPP]] gaining a majority of seats in West Pakistan (current day Pakistan) and the [[Awami League]] gaining a majority in [[East Pakistan]] (current day Bangladesh).\n\nAfter he was unable to reach a compromise between the PPP and the Awami League, President Yahya Khan invited [[Nurul Amin]] of the [[Pakistan Muslim League]] to become the [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]], and also appointed him as the first [[Vice President of Pakistan|Vice President]]. The growing instigated violence against [[Pakistanis]] in East Pakistan forced President Yahya Khan to use [[Operation Searchlight|force]] in order to maintain [[Law and order (politics)|order]] there, which further escalated [[Bangladesh Liberation War|Bengali resistance]] (1970).  [[Operation Chengiz Khan|Preemptive strikes]] against [[India]] led to another [[Indo-Pakistani war of 1971|war]] in 1971, which [[Independence of Bangladesh|freed]] [[East Pakistan]] and created [[Bangladesh]].\n\nTaking personal responsibility for the political isolation and devastation of [[Pakistan]] after the [[Fall of Dhaka|fall]] of [[East Pakistan]], President Yahya Khan stepped down and ceded power to [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]]. President Bhutto created the current [[Constitution of Pakistan]] in 1973, transforming [[Pakistan]] into a [[parliamentary democracy]], and reducing presidential powers to that of a ceremonial [[figurehead]].\n\n===Past Interventions===\nThe [[1977 Pakistani general election|general elections]] held in 1977 resulted in an atmosphere of civil unrest instigated by the [[Conservatism in Pakistan|right-wing]] alliance, the [[Pakistan National Alliance]]. The events leading to it resulted in [[Operation Fair Play|military intervention]] by [[Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan)|chief of army staff]] General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]] and [[Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee|Chairman Joint Chiefs]] Admiral [[Mohammad Shariff]]. Suspending the [[Constitution of Pakistan|Constitution]] in 1977, General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]] took over the presidency in 1978. Zia's [[Zia regime|presidency]] oversaw the modern growth of [[Islamic fundamentalism|far-right ideas]] in the country. Succumbing to domestic pressure to restore the [[Constitution of Pakistan|Constitution]], President [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]] held a [[1984 Pakistani Islamisation programme referendum|referendum]] (1984) and called for [[1985 Pakistani general election|general elections]] in 1985. President [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]] appointed [[Mohammad Khan Junejo|Mohammad Junejo]] as [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] and assumed more [[Political power|powers]] through the [[Eighth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan|constitutional amendment]]. After dismissing [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Mohammad Khan Junejo|Junejo]], President [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]] announced that new [[1988 Pakistani general election|general elections]] would be held, but President [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia]] [[Death of Zia-ul-Haq|died in a plane crash]] in 1988.\n\nThe [[1988 Pakistani general election|general elections]] held in 1988 witnessed the victory of [[Pakistan Peoples Party|PPP]] in 1988, and appointed [[Chairman Senate]] [[Ghulam Ishaq Khan]] to the presidency. Conflict between [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Benazir Bhutto]] and President [[Ghulam Ishaq Khan]] arose in two areas regarding the issues of appointments. President [[Ghulam Ishaq Khan]] repeatedly intervened in government matters and [[Corruption charges against Benazir Bhutto and Asif Ali Zardari|leveled charges]] against [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Benazir Bhutto]]; thus [[Eighth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan|dismissing]] [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Benazir Bhutto]] in 1990. After holding [[1988 Pakistani general election|general elections]] in 1990, [[Nawaz Sharif]] brought up an ideologically [[First Sharif ministry|conservative government]] and President [[Ghulam Ishaq Khan]] unsuccessfully tried to dismiss Sharif. After a successful intervention by [[Supreme Court of Pakistan|Supreme Court]] and [[Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee|Chairman Joint Chiefs]] General [[Shamim Alam Khan|Shamim Allam]], President [[Ghulam Ishaq Khan]] and Prime Minister [[Nawaz Sharif]] tendered resignations in 1993.\n\nFollowing the [[1993 Pakistani general election|new elections]] held in 1993, [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Benazir Bhutto]] established a strong government after appointing loyalist [[Farooq Leghari]] to the presidency. However, the [[Corruption charges against Benazir Bhutto and Asif Ali Zardari|corruption charges]] and the controversial death of [[Murtaza Bhutto]] in 1996 resulted in President [[Farooq Leghari]] [[Eighth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan|dismissing]] [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Benazir Bhutto]]. In 1997, President [[Farooq Leghari]] could not overcome the heavy mandate bestowed on Prime Minister [[Nawaz Sharif]] by the public in [[1997 Pakistani general election|1997]].  President [[Farooq Leghari|Leghari]] unsuccessfully supported [[Chief Justice of Pakistan|Chief Justice]] [[Sajjad Ali Shah]]\u2014 both of them resigned, ending the conflict between the [[Judiciary of Pakistan|Judiciary]], the [[Prime Minister's Secretariat (Pakistan)|Executive]], and the [[Parliament of Pakistan|Parliament]]. After appointing [[Rafiq Tarar]], the [[Parliament of Pakistan|Parliament]] successfully passed [[Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan|constitutional amendment]] to decisively limit the presidency. After staging a controversial [[1999 Pakistani coup d'\u00e9tat|self coup]] in 1999, General [[Pervez Musharraf]] dismissed Prime Minister [[Nawaz Sharif]] and President [[Rafiq Tarar]] in 2001 while assuming more [[Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan|powers to the presidency]].  In January 2004, the [[Electoral College of Pakistan|Electoral College]] [[2004 Pakistani presidential election|elected]] Musharraf, and as a result he was, according to the Constitution, \"deemed to be elected\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Waldman|first=Amy|title=Pakistan Gives Musharraf Confidence Vote as President|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/02/international/asia/02STAN.html?ex=1388379600&en=a5ffeee2a4e1367a&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND|newspaper=New York Times|date=January 2, 2004|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515004758/http://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/02/international/asia/02STAN.html?ex=1388379600&en=a5ffeee2a4e1367a&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND|archivedate=May 15, 2013}}</ref>\n\nPresident Musharraf's repeated unconstitutional intervention resulted in a standoff with the [[Judiciary of Pakistan|Judiciary]], and declared a [[2007 Pakistani martial law|state of emergency]] in 2007, after dismissing the [[List of Justices of Supreme Court of Pakistan|senior justices]] of the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan|Supreme Court]].

[[Algernon Herbert]], a younger son of the first [[Earl of Carnarvon]]. He was educated at [[Eton College|Eton]] and [[Balliol College, Oxford]]. He won a Balliol scholarship in 1849 and subsequently the Hertford and Ireland scholarships. He took a first class in classical moderations, won the Latin verse prize in 1852, and obtained second-class final honours in the classical school. He was elected [[All Souls College, Oxford|Fellow of All Souls]] in 1854 and was [[Eldon Law Scholarship|Eldon law scholar]]. In 1855 he was private secretary to [[William Ewart Gladstone]] and was called to the bar of the [[Inner Temple]] in 1858.<ref name=\"Dictionary\">{{cite book | last=Serle | first=Percival | title=Dictionary of Australian Biography  | location=Sydney | publisher=Project Gutenberg of Australia | origyear=1949 | year=2006 | oclc=74490966}}</ref><ref name=times/>\n\n==Queensland colony==\nWhen Queensland was formed into a separate colony Sir [[George Bowen]] was appointed the first governor. He arrived at Brisbane on 10 December 1859 and brought Herbert with him as his private secretary. On the day of the governor's arrival, Herbert was gazetted as colonial secretary with [[Ratcliffe Pring]] as attorney-general. These with the governor formed an executive council to which additions were made afterwards. At the election held early in 1860 Herbert was returned unopposed for one of the [[Electoral district of Leichhardt (Queensland)|Leichhardt]] seats in the [[Legislative Assembly of Queensland]] and became the first [[Premier of Queensland]]. He showed himself to be a good leader and held office from December 1859 to February 1866.<ref name=\"Dictionary\"/>\n\nDuring his time as Premier four land acts were passed, and the education question was also the subject of early measures. The governor, in writing to the secretary of state, stated that the Queensland parliament \"had passed a greater number of really useful measures than any other parliament in any of the Australian colonies\". Certainly the first Queensland government was in marked contrast to those of the other colonies, each of which averaged half a dozen ministries in the same period. Herbert, however, fell into some disfavour when financial difficulties arose. He resigned in February 1866 and was succeeded by [[Arthur Macalister]] who was premier until 20 July 1866. Herbert was anxious to return to England on account of private business, but at the request of the governor formed a ministry which lasted less than three weeks and was merged in the second Macalister ministry. Herbert then left for England, having gained much experience which was to be very useful to him in later years.<ref name=\"Dictionary\"/>\n\n==Career in England==\nA few months after Herbert's arrival in England he was appointed Assistant-Secretary to the [[Board of Trade]], in 1870 was made Assistant Under-Secretary for the Colonies while his relative, [[Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon]], was the serving Secretary of State, and in 1871 became [[Permanent Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies]]. He held this position for 21 years with great distinction. His attitude was generally conciliatory and he was tactful in dealing with men who came in contact with him. In 1882 he was created K.C.B. and in 1892 G.C.B. In the same year he was appointed chancellor of the [[Order of St Michael and St George]]. He left the colonial office in 1892, but afterwards took up his duties again for a few months at the special request of [[Joseph Chamberlain]]. In 1893-6 he was agent-general for Tasmania, and did active work in connection with the formation of the [[British Empire League]]. In December 1903 he was chairman of the tariff commission.<ref name=times/>\n\n== Later years ==\nIn later years, Robert Herbert suffered from heart trouble. Believing his health would benefit from a sea voyage, he went for a cruise in the Mediterranean. He met his sister in [[Marseilles]], France where his health worsened and he returned immediately to England.

[[Algernon Herbert]], a younger son of the first [[Earl of Carnarvon]]. He was educated at [[Eton College|Eton]] and [[Balliol College, Oxford]]. He won a Balliol scholarship in 1849 and subsequently the Hertford and Ireland scholarships. He took a first class in classical moderations, won the Latin verse prize in 1852, and obtained second-class final honours in the classical school. He was elected [[All Souls College, Oxford|Fellow of All Souls]] in 1854 and was [[Eldon Law Scholarship|Eldon law scholar]]. In 1855 he was private secretary to [[William Ewart Gladstone]] and was called to the bar of the [[Inner Temple]] in 1858.<ref name=\"Dictionary\">{{cite book | last=Serle | first=Percival | title=Dictionary of Australian Biography  | location=Sydney | publisher=Project Gutenberg of Australia | origyear=1949 | year=2006 | oclc=74490966}}</ref><ref name=times/>\n\n==Queensland colony==\nWhen Queensland was formed into a separate colony Sir [[George Bowen]] was appointed the first governor. He arrived at Brisbane on 10 December 1859 and brought Herbert with him as his private secretary. On the day of the governor's arrival, Herbert was gazetted as colonial secretary with [[Ratcliffe Pring]] as attorney-general. These with the governor formed an executive council to which additions were made afterwards. At the election held early in 1860 Herbert was returned unopposed for one of the [[Electoral district of Leichhardt (Queensland)|Leichhardt]] seats in the [[Legislative Assembly of Queensland]] and became the first [[Premier of Queensland]]. He showed himself to be a good leader and held office from December 1859 to February 1866.<ref name=\"Dictionary\"/>\n\nDuring his time as Premier four land acts were passed, and the education question was also the subject of early measures. The governor, in writing to the secretary of state, stated that the Queensland parliament \"had passed a greater number of really useful measures than any other parliament in any of the Australian colonies\". Certainly the first Queensland government was in marked contrast to those of the other colonies, each of which averaged half a dozen ministries in the same period. Herbert, however, fell into some disfavour when financial difficulties arose. He resigned in February 1866 and was succeeded by [[Arthur Macalister]] who was premier until 20 July 1866. Herbert was anxious to return to England on account of private business, but at the request of the governor formed a ministry which lasted less than three weeks and was merged in the second Macalister ministry. Herbert then left for England, having gained much experience which was to be very useful to him in later years.<ref name=\"Dictionary\"/>\n\n==Career in England==\nA few months after Herbert's arrival in England he was appointed Assistant-Secretary to the [[Board of Trade]], in 1870 was made Assistant Under-Secretary for the Colonies while his relative, [[Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon]], was the serving Secretary of State, and in 1871 became [[Permanent Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies]]. He held this position for 21 years with great distinction. His attitude was generally conciliatory and he was tactful in dealing with men who came in contact with him. In 1882 he was created K.C.B. and in 1892 G.C.B. In the same year he was appointed chancellor of the [[Order of St Michael and St George]]. He left the colonial office in 1892, but afterwards took up his duties again for a few months at the special request of [[Joseph Chamberlain]]. In 1893-6 he was agent-general for Tasmania, and did active work in connection with the formation of the [[British Empire League]]. In December 1903 he was chairman of the tariff commission.<ref name=times/>\n\n== Later years ==\nIn later years, Robert Herbert suffered from heart trouble. Believing his health would benefit from a sea voyage, he went for a cruise in the Mediterranean. He met his sister in [[Marseilles]], France where his health worsened and he returned immediately to England. He was taken in an ambulance railway car on the [[Great Eastern Railway]] to his residence at [[Ickleton]], Cambridgeshire, where he died on 6 May 1905.<ref name=times>{{cite news|title=Death of Sir Robert Herbert|newspaper=[[The Times]]|date=8 May 1905|page=6}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[Image:Herston house.jpg|thumb|left|Herston House, 1800s]]\nRobert Herbert met his companion, [[John Bramston (Australian politician)|John Bramston]], in the early 1850s at [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol College]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]], England.
