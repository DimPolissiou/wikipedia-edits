It was there that he learned of the rebellion of Alexios Komnenos against [[Nikephoros III Botaneiates]] ({{reign|1078|1081}}) in 1081, and it was he who informed the ''Caesar'' of it.

To avoid conflict and facilitate negotiations, he was given custody of the wife of the sultan of the [[Seljuk Sultanate of Rum]] [[Kilij Arslan I]] ({{reign|1092|1107}}) and the daughter of Tzachas, who had been captured at Nicaea.<ref>Anna Komnene.

The ''megas doux'' readily accepted and took possession of the city, naming Kaspax as its governor. Even before Kaspax could assume his duties however, he was murdered by a [[Islam|Muslim]], and the enraged sailors of the fleet massacred the people of the city. John Doukas was unable to restrain them, and restored order only after the massacre had run its course.

At Cyprus, Rhapsomates's initial resistance was overcome, and he himself was captured soon after. [[Eumathios Philokales]] was installed as the island's new governor, and the fleet returned to Constantinople.<ref>Anna Komnene.

To avoid conflict and facilitate negotiations, he was given custody of the wife of the sultan of the [[Seljuk Sultanate of Rum]] [[Kilij Arslan I]] ({{reign|1092|1107}}) and the daughter of Tzachas, who had been captured at Nicaea.<ref>Anna Komnene.

After a short siege, Tzachas agreed to surrender the city in exchange for his safe departure and guarantees of the inhabitants' safety. The ''megas doux'' readily accepted and took possession of the city, naming Kaspax as its governor. Even before Kaspax could assume his duties however, he was murdered by a [[Islam|Muslim]], and the enraged sailors of the fleet massacred the people of the city. John Doukas was unable to restrain them, and restored order only after the massacre had run its course. He then left the experienced general [[Hyaleas]] behind as ''doux'' of the city along with the entire fleet to secure the city, and continued his campaign.<ref>Anna Komnene.

There, he defeated the Turkish garrison after a long battle, and took 2,000 captives, who were resettled in the Aegean islands. [[Petzeas]] was installed as ''doux'' of Ephesus, and John with his army turned inland.<ref>Anna Komnene. ''Alexiad'', XI.5 ({{harvnb|Dawes|1928|pp=281\u2013282}})</ref> He took the cities of [[Sardeis]] and [[Ala\u015fehir|Philadelphia]], which he entrusted to Michael Kekaumenos, and reached [[Laodicea on the Lycus|Laodicea]], which opened its gates to him. From there, he marched to the fortresses of [[Choma (fortress)|Choma]] and [[Lampe (fortress)|Lampe]], installing [[Eustathios Kamytzes]] as governor, and reached [[Polybotos]], where most of the Turks who had survived at Ephesus had fled. Having caught them by surprise, Doukas's army defeated them and took much booty.<ref>Anna Komnene.

It is, however, known from monastic documents that at some point he retired to a monastery and assumed the [[monastic name]] Antony. The date of his death is also not known, but in a ''[[typikon]]'' dated to 1110\u20131116 he is mentioned as being alive, while in another ''typikon'' of 1136, he is explicitly mentioned as having died.{{sfn|Polemis|1968|p=69}}{{sfn|Skoulatos|1980|p=149}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite journal|first=Jean-Claude|last=Cheynet|title=La place de la Serbie dans la diplomatie byzantine \u00e0 la fin du XIe si\u00e8cle|language=French|trans-title=The Position of Serbia in Byzantine Diplomacy at the End of the 11th Century|url=http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/img/doi/0584-9888/2008/0584-98880845089C.pdf|journal=Recueil des travaux de l'Institut d'\u00e9tudes byzantines|volume=XLV|year=2008|doi=10.2298/ZRVI0845089C|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Curta|first=Florin|title=Southeastern Europe in the Middle Ages 500-1250|location=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0-52-181539-0|url=https://archive.org/details/southeasterneuro0000curt|url-access=registration|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|editor-last=Dawes|editor-first=Elizabeth A.|title=The Alexiad|location=London|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|year=1928|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/AnnaComnena-Alexiad.html|ref=harv}}\n*{{Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium}}\n* {{cite journal|first=Paul|last=Gautier|title=D\u00e9fection et soumission de la Cr\u00e8te sous Alexis Ier Comn\u00e8ne|language=French|trans-title=Defection and Submission of Crete under Alexios I Komnenos|url=http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/rebyz_0766-5598_1977_num_35_1_2071|journal=Revue des \u00e9tudes byzantines|volume=35|year=1977|pages=215\u2013227|doi=10.3406/rebyz.1977.2071|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Polemis|first=Demetrios I.|title=The Doukai: A Contribution to Byzantine Prosopography|location=London|publisher=The Athlone Press|year=1968|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sx5dAAAAIAAJ|ref=harv}}\n* {{Les personnages byzantins de l'Alexiade}}\n\n\n{{Good article}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Doukas, John}}\n[[Category:1060s births]]\n[[Category:12th-century deaths]]\n[[Category:11th-century Byzantine people]]\n[[Category:12th-century Byzantine people]]\n[[Category:Megaloi doukes]]\n[[Category:Byzantine governors of Dyrrhachium]]\n[[Category:Byzantine generals]]\n[[Category:Christians of the First Crusade]]\n[[Category:Aaronios family|John]]\n[[Category:Komnenos dynasty]]\n[[Category:Doukid dynasty|John]]\n[[Category:Generals of Alexios I Komnenos]]\n[[Category:Eastern Orthodox monks]]\n[[Category:Byzantine people of the Byzantine\u2013Seljuq Wars]]\n[[Category:Medieval Aegean Sea]]\n", "name_user": "Srnec", "label": "safe", "comment": "link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Doukas_(megas_doux)"}
