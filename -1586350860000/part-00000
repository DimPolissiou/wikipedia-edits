He studied Asian languages at the [[University of British Columbia]], and later earned a degree from [[McGill University]]'s [[McGill School of Architecture|School of Architecture]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archivalcollections.library.mcgill.ca/index.php/erickson-arthur-1924-2009|title=Erickson, Arthur, 1924-2009|last=|first=|date=|website=McGill Archival Collections Catalogue|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=28 January 2020}}</ref> He is renowned for designing some of the most recognizable buildings and sites in Canada, including [[Roy Thompson Hall|Roy Thomson Hall]], [[Robson Square]], the [[Museum of Glass]] and the [[Simon Fraser University|Simon Fraser University campus]].\n\n==Early life and education==\nErickson was born in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]] on June 14, 1924. The son of Oscar Erickson and Myrtle Chatterson, he had an interest and talent for painting from an early age. Like his father, he served in the [[Canadian Intelligence Corps|Canadian Army Intelligence Corps]] during [[World War II]]. It was during this time that he became familiar with the Japanese language, going on to serve in India, Celyon, and Malaysia.<ref name=\":2\" /> This experience fostered his interest in the art and philosophy of these areas.\n\nErickson\u2019s original intent was to enter into a career in the diplomatic service, however this changed after he stumbled upon an article about [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]. Inspired by Wright\u2019s studio and works, Arthur pursued a career in architecture.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.aefoundation.ca/arthur|title=Arthur Erickson Foundation - Arthur|website=www.aefoundation.ca|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> Erickson\u2019s post-secondary studies included an undergraduate degree at the [[University of British Columbia]], followed by the [[McGill School of Architecture|School of Architecture]] at [[McGill University]]. After graduating from McGill in 1950, Erickson was granted a travel scholarship and traveled in the Mediterranean, Middle East, and Japan. Travelling to these areas allowed him to deepen his exploration of climate and style in their relationship to architecture. Erickson also became a professor, teaching at the [[University of Oregon]] and subsequently the [[University of British Columbia]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.the-peak.ca/2014/06/the-concrete-acropolis/ |title= The Concrete Acropolis |accessdate=June 9, 2014 |last=Hill |first=Max |date=2014-06-09 |publisher=The Peak}}</ref> After teaching, he worked for a few years at [[Thompson Berwick and Pratt and Partners]]<ref>{{cite book |last=Stouck |first=David |date=Sep 6, 2013 |title=Arthur Erickson: An Architect's Life |url= |location= |publisher=Douglas & McIntyre |page= |isbn=978-1771000116 |accessdate= }}</ref> before he went on to design houses in partnership with Geoffrey Massey. In 1963, Erickson and Massey submitted the winning design for [[Simon Fraser University]].<ref name=\"G&M\">[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/the-greatest-architect-we-have-ever-produced/article1147768/ Martin, Sandra. \"The greatest architect we have ever produced,\" ''The Globe and Mail'', Friday, May 22, 2009.]</ref>\n\n== Style and method ==\nWhen he started his career in 1953,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Sabatino|first=Michelangelo|date=August 2008|title=Arthur Erickson and essential tectonics|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13602360802328065|journal=The Journal of Architecture|language=en|volume=13|issue=4|pages=493\u2013514|doi=10.1080/13602360802328065|issn=1360-2365}}</ref> Erickson's earlier buildings were often modernist concrete structures designed to respond to the natural conditions of their locations, especially climate. Due to his travels to the Far East, Erickson was fond of integrating light and water into his designs, along with the characteristic horizontal elements and terraces that came from the vernacular architecture of that region.<ref name=\":0\" /> Many buildings, such as the [[Museum of Anthropology at UBC|Museum of Anthropology]] in Vancouver, are inspired by the [[Timber framing|post and beam]] architecture of the Coastal [[First Nations]]. The tectonics of the post-and-beam style can also be found in the construction of Asian temples and the Canadian and American log cabin, further linking his architectural style to his travels during his education. Additionally, Erickson is also known for numerous [[Futurist architecture|futuristic]] designs such as the [[Fresno City Hall]] and the Biological Sciences Building at the [[University of California, Irvine]]. His work balanced the style of modernism with an integration of the surrounding natural environment.\n\n== Significant works ==\n\n=== Simon Fraser University (Burnaby, BC) ===\n[[File:Simon Fraser University.jpg|thumb|[[Simon Fraser University]], [[Burnaby]], B.C.]]\nAs mentioned above, Erickson\u2019s partnership with Geoffrey Massey lead to the winning design submitted for Simon Fraser University. Located on [[Burnaby Mountain]], the unfinished concrete blends in with the surrounding geography in colour but not in shape. When viewed from above in plan, the campus forms a geometric contrast to the snowy mountains of its context. The site and scale of the project is reminiscent of utopian designs from French architects in the late eighteenth century such as [[\u00c9tienne-Louis Boull\u00e9e|Etienne-Louis Bouillee]]<ref name=\":0\" />[[\u00c9tienne-Louis Boull\u00e9e|.]] The design featured an indoor plaza with massive skylights in order to respond sensitively to Vancouver\u2019s rainy, cool climate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Arthur-Erickson|title=Arthur Erickson {{!}} Canadian architect|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> The university provides a balance of the inherent character of British Columbia while still exploring the structural ambitions of the modernist period in the 1960s. Erickson and Massey's project was internationally acclaimed and allowed Arthur\u2019s career to become more distinguished while opening the door to new possibilities.\n\n=== Museum of Anthropology at the University of British Columbia (Vancouver, BC) ===\n[[File:UBC Museum of Anthropology 12.jpg|thumb|[[Museum of Anthropology at UBC]], Vancouver, B.C.]]\nBuilt in 1976, it was created as an inclusion to the campus at the [[University of British Columbia]]. This building blends methods of reinforced concrete and the traditional post-and-beam construction to articulate the structure throughout the project. Oversized beams evoke a monumental feeling in many of Erickson's projects, calling on the size and scale of the trees found in the surrounding context. This project is designed to display the aboriginal art of the province, and is well known for Erickson\u2019s use of concrete piers and large stretches of glass. By using concrete beams to represent dematerialized logs and opening up the main atrium through expanses of glass, Erickson contrasts the traditional notion of post-and-beam construction to integrate these characteristics into a modernistic building.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Robson Square (Vancouver, BC) ===\n[[File:Robson Square waterfall 2018.jpg|thumb|221x221px|[[Robson Square]], Vancouver, B.C.]]\nBuilt in Vancouver in 1979 as a large civic center, Erickson\u2019s design included waterfalls, a roof garden, several plazas, and stairs with ramps integrated within. This complex is one of the few in North America that integrates everything from public space and landscape to the surrounding buildings, from the art gallery to courts of law. As time goes on, more additions are being created that seem to contrast the original intent of the design. Glass barriers were installed near the waterfall, preventing people from getting close to it, as well as on the edges of planters to prevent people from being able to sit on them. It has also since lost the outdoor restaurants, cinema, and large auditorium that once existed on the site.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Smedmen|first=Lisa|url=https://search-proquest-com.lib.ryerson.ca/docview/359530336?accountid=13631|title=Heritage advocate targets Robson Square; Arthur Erickson creation subjected to 'incremental intrusions'|date=June 5, 2009|work=Vancouver Courier|access-date=March 30, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Roy Thomson Hall (Toronto, ON) ===\n[[File:RoyThompsonHall.jpg|thumb|[[Roy Thomson Hall]], Toronto, Canada (1982)|222x222px]]Designed and built in the city of Toronto, Roy Thomson Hall was not designed to blend into its surroundings in order to be recognized as a landmark and home to the Toronto Symphony Orchestra.

The interior used a colour palette of grey and silver to harmonize with the concrete structure and create a peaceful atmosphere.

Erickson's design for the museum features a 90-foot-tall metal cone erupting from a structure of steel and concrete. The enormous cone acts as a 'chimney' for the museum's amphitheater, where visitors can overlook visiting artists as they create glass art. Large public art displays and concrete plazas overlook the neighbouring waterway, while pools of water interlaced with stairs and switchback ramps to connect each levels. The museum aims to connect the downtown core to the city's waterfront as well, through a 150-foot long bridge named the [[Bridge of Glass|Chihuly Bridge of Glass]]. The bridge is named after Tacoma native [[Dale Chihuly]], who was a pioneer of the [[Studio glass|Studio Glass Movement]] and has many works on display at the museum.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bailey|first=Mike|date=July 2, 2002|title=HOUSE OF GLASS ; TACOMA MUSEUM AND BRIDGE WILL MAKE CITY'S ONCE-GRIM WATERFRONT A SHOWPLACE OF NATIONAL PROMINENCE.|url=http://lib.ryerson.ca/login?url=https://search-proquest-com.lib.ryerson.ca/docview/253146721?accountid=13631|journal=Columbian|volume=|pages=|via=ProQuest}}</ref>\n\n===List of completed works===\n[[File:One Cal Plaza.jpg|thumb|[[One California Plaza]], Los Angeles, CA(1985)|292x292px]]\n[[File:Fresno City Hall.JPG|thumb|[[Fresno City Hall]], Fresno, CA (1991)|225x225px]]\n<!-- The dates on Erickson's websites are the years he designed them - these dates are the years they were *completed*, where applicable -->\n\n* 1955: Killam-Massey House, [[West Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], Canada<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arthurerickson.com/wood-houses/killam-massey-house/7/|title=Killam-Massey House|work=Project description|publisher=Arthur Erickson}}</ref>\n* 1958: Filberg Residence, [[Comox, British Columbia|Comox]], [[British Columbia]], Canada\n* 1960: Dyde House, [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]], [[Alberta]], Canada\n* 1963: Graham House, [[West Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]]\n* 1965: [[MacMillan Bloedel#The MacBlo Building|MacMillan Bloedel Building]], [[Vancouver]], British Columbia\n* 1965: Smith Residence, [[West Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]]\n* 1965 onward in stages: [[Simon Fraser University]], [[Burnaby]], British Columbia<ref name=\"Pound 2005\">{{cite book |title='Fitzhenry and Whiteside Book of Canadian Facts and Dates'  |last=Pound |first=Richard W. |publisher=Fitzhenry and Whiteside |year=2005}}</ref>\n* 1967 Catton House (with Geoffrey Massey)\n* 1968: Hi-View Estates [[Port Moody]], [[British Columbia]]\n* 1970: Government of Canada pavilion, [[Expo '70]], [[Osaka]], won top architectural award Aug 17, 1970.<ref name=\"Pound 2005\"/>\n* 1970: Ross Street Sikh Temple, [[Khalsa Diwan Society Vancouver|Khalsa Diwan Society, Vancouver]] \n* 1971: University Hall, [[University of Lethbridge]], [[Lethbridge]], [[Alberta]]\n* 1973: Champlain Heights Elementary School, Vancouver, British Columbia<ref>[http://vancouverschools125.org/killarney/champlain-heights/ Champlain Heights] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131209061045/http://vancouverschools125.org/killarney/champlain-heights/ |date=2013-12-09 }}. vancouverschools125.

The son of Oscar Erickson and Myrtle Chatterson, he had an interest and talent for painting from an early age. Like his father, he served in the [[Canadian Intelligence Corps|Canadian Army Intelligence Corps]] during [[World War II]]. It was during this time that he became familiar with the Japanese language, going on to serve in India, Celyon, and Malaysia.<ref name=\":2\" /> This experience fostered his interest in the art and philosophy of these areas.\n\nErickson\u2019s original intent was to enter into a career in the diplomatic service, however this changed after he stumbled upon an article about [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]. Inspired by Wright\u2019s studio and works, Arthur pursued a career in architecture.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.aefoundation.ca/arthur|title=Arthur Erickson Foundation - Arthur|website=www.aefoundation.ca|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> Erickson\u2019s post-secondary studies included an undergraduate degree at the [[University of British Columbia]], followed by the [[McGill School of Architecture|School of Architecture]] at [[McGill University]]. After graduating from McGill in 1950, Erickson was granted a travel scholarship and traveled in the Mediterranean, Middle East, and Japan. Travelling to these areas allowed him to deepen his exploration of climate and style in their relationship to architecture. Erickson also became a professor, teaching at the [[University of Oregon]] and subsequently the [[University of British Columbia]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.the-peak.ca/2014/06/the-concrete-acropolis/ |title= The Concrete Acropolis |accessdate=June 9, 2014 |last=Hill |first=Max |date=2014-06-09 |publisher=The Peak}}</ref> After teaching, he worked for a few years at [[Thompson Berwick and Pratt and Partners]]<ref>{{cite book |last=Stouck |first=David |date=Sep 6, 2013 |title=Arthur Erickson: An Architect's Life |url= |location= |publisher=Douglas & McIntyre |page= |isbn=978-1771000116 |accessdate= }}</ref> before he went on to design houses in partnership with Geoffrey Massey.

Due to his travels to the Far East, Erickson was fond of integrating light and water into his designs, along with the characteristic horizontal elements and terraces that came from the vernacular architecture of that region.<ref name=\":0\" /> Many buildings, such as the [[Museum of Anthropology at UBC|Museum of Anthropology]] in Vancouver, are inspired by the [[Timber framing|post and beam]] architecture of the Coastal [[First Nations]]. The tectonics of the post-and-beam style can also be found in the construction of Asian temples and the Canadian and American log cabin, further linking his architectural style to his travels during his education. Additionally, Erickson is also known for numerous [[Futurist architecture|futuristic]] designs such as the [[Fresno City Hall]] and the Biological Sciences Building at the [[University of California, Irvine]]. His work balanced the style of modernism with an integration of the surrounding natural environment.\n\n== Significant works ==\n\n=== Simon Fraser University (Burnaby, BC) ===\n[[File:Simon Fraser University.jpg|thumb|[[Simon Fraser University]], [[Burnaby]], B.C.]]\nAs mentioned above, Erickson\u2019s partnership with Geoffrey Massey lead to the winning design submitted for Simon Fraser University. Located on [[Burnaby Mountain]], the unfinished concrete blends in with the surrounding geography in colour but not in shape. When viewed from above in plan, the campus forms a geometric contrast to the snowy mountains of its context. The site and scale of the project is reminiscent of utopian designs from French architects in the late eighteenth century such as [[\u00c9tienne-Louis Boull\u00e9e|Etienne-Louis Bouillee]]<ref name=\":0\" />[[\u00c9tienne-Louis Boull\u00e9e|.]] The design featured an indoor plaza with massive skylights in order to respond sensitively to Vancouver\u2019s rainy, cool climate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Arthur-Erickson|title=Arthur Erickson {{!}} Canadian architect|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> The university provides a balance of the inherent character of British Columbia while still exploring the structural ambitions of the modernist period in the 1960s. Erickson and Massey's project was internationally acclaimed and allowed Arthur\u2019s career to become more distinguished while opening the door to new possibilities.\n\n=== Museum of Anthropology at the University of British Columbia (Vancouver, BC) ===\n[[File:UBC Museum of Anthropology 12.jpg|thumb|[[Museum of Anthropology at UBC]], Vancouver, B.C.]]\nBuilt in 1976, it was created as an inclusion to the campus at the [[University of British Columbia]]. This building blends methods of reinforced concrete and the traditional post-and-beam construction to articulate the structure throughout the project. Oversized beams evoke a monumental feeling in many of Erickson's projects, calling on the size and scale of the trees found in the surrounding context. This project is designed to display the aboriginal art of the province, and is well known for Erickson\u2019s use of concrete piers and large stretches of glass. By using concrete beams to represent dematerialized logs and opening up the main atrium through expanses of glass, Erickson contrasts the traditional notion of post-and-beam construction to integrate these characteristics into a modernistic building.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Robson Square (Vancouver, BC) ===\n[[File:Robson Square waterfall 2018.jpg|thumb|221x221px|[[Robson Square]], Vancouver, B.C.]]\nBuilt in Vancouver in 1979 as a large civic center, Erickson\u2019s design included waterfalls, a roof garden, several plazas, and stairs with ramps integrated within. This complex is one of the few in North America that integrates everything from public space and landscape to the surrounding buildings, from the art gallery to courts of law. As time goes on, more additions are being created that seem to contrast the original intent of the design. Glass barriers were installed near the waterfall, preventing people from getting close to it, as well as on the edges of planters to prevent people from being able to sit on them. It has also since lost the outdoor restaurants, cinema, and large auditorium that once existed on the site.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Smedmen|first=Lisa|url=https://search-proquest-com.lib.ryerson.ca/docview/359530336?accountid=13631|title=Heritage advocate targets Robson Square; Arthur Erickson creation subjected to 'incremental intrusions'|date=June 5, 2009|work=Vancouver Courier|access-date=March 30, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Roy Thomson Hall (Toronto, ON) ===\n[[File:RoyThompsonHall.jpg|thumb|[[Roy Thomson Hall]], Toronto, Canada (1982)|222x222px]]Designed and built in the city of Toronto, Roy Thomson Hall was not designed to blend into its surroundings in order to be recognized as a landmark and home to the Toronto Symphony Orchestra.

Erickson's design for the museum features a 90-foot-tall metal cone erupting from a structure of steel and concrete. The enormous cone acts as a 'chimney' for the museum's amphitheater, where visitors can overlook visiting artists as they create glass art.

People left in two directions: (1) from the east side of the town northeastwards along the river, passing [[Askeran (town)|Askeran]] to their left (this route, according to Armenian officials, was provided as a \"free corridor\"); (2) from the north side of the town northeastwards, passing Askeran to their right (it appears that fewer refugees fled using this route). Thus, the majority of civilians left Khojaly, while around 200\u2013300 people stayed in Khojaly, hiding in their houses and basements. As a result of the shelling of the town, an unascertained number of civilians were killed in Khojaly during the assault. The Armenian side practically refused to tell Memorial observers how many people so perished. The refugees in both groups were fired upon, as a result of which many of them were killed. Those who remained alive dispersed. Running refugees came across Armenian military posts and were fired upon. Some refugees managed to escape to Agdam, some, mainly women and children (the exact number is impossible to determine), froze to death while wandering around in mountains, some were captured near the villages of Nakhichevanik and Pirjamal.<ref name=\"memo.ru\"/>\n\n[[Helsinki Watch]] reported that \"the militia, still in uniform, and some still carrying their guns, were interspersed with the masses of civilians\" and according to eyewitness accounts there was shooting between Armenian and the Azerbaijani forces which were mixed with the civilians.<ref>Helsinki Watch. ''\"Bloodshed in the Caucasus: Escalation of the Armed Conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh\" New York, September 1992'' p. 21</ref> At the same time, [[Human Rights Watch]] and [[Memorial (society)|Memorial]] stated that the killing of civilians could not be justified under any circumstances. Human Rights Watch noted that \"the attacking party [i.e., Karabakh Armenian forces] is still obliged to take precautionary measures to avoid or minimize civilian casualties. In particular, the party must suspend an attack if it becomes apparent that the attack may be expected to cause civilian casualties that are excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated. The circumstances surrounding the attack at Nakhichevanik on those fleeing from Khojaly indicate that Armenian forces and the troops of the 366th CIS regiment (who were not apparently acting on orders from their commanders) deliberately disregarded this customary law restraint on attacks\".<ref name=\"hrw\">{{cite web |url=http://hrw.org/english/docs/1997/03/24/azerba16933.htm |title=Letter to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Armenia from the Executive Director of Human Rights Watch dated March 24, 1997 |publisher=Hrw.org |date=24 March 1997 |accessdate=28 April 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906155003/http://hrw.org/english/docs/1997/03/24/azerba16933.htm |archivedate=6 September 2008  }}</ref><ref name=\"Helsinki 1992. pp. 24\">Human Rights Watch/Helsinki.

According to members of the Armenian armed forces, the Azerbaijani forces attempted to battle through from Agdam in the direction of the 'free corridor'. At the moment when the Armenian outposts were fighting off this attack, the first groups of Khojaly refugees approached them from the rear. The armed people who were among the refugees began firing at the Armenian outposts. During the battle, one outpost was destroyed, but the fighters from another outpost, of whose existence the Azerbaijanis were unaware, opened fire from a close distance at the people coming from Khojaly. According to testimonies of Khojaly refugees (including those published in the press), the armed people inside the refugee column did exchange gunfire with Armenian outposts, but on each occasion the fire was opened first from the Armenian side.}}\n\nThe site of the mass killing of Khojaly inhabitants was filmed on videotape by Azerbaijani journalist [[Chingiz Mustafayev]]. He was accompanied by the Russian journalist Yuri Romanov during the first helicopter flight to the scene of the tragedy. Romanov described in his memoir how he looked out of the window of the helicopter and literally jumped back from an incredibly horrible view. The whole area up to the horizon was covered with dead bodies of women, elderly people and boys and girls of all ages, from newly born to teenagers. From the mass of bodies two figures caught his sight. An old woman with uncovered gray head was lying face down next to a small girl in a blue jacket. Their legs were tied with barbed wire, and the old woman's hands were tied as well. Both were shot in their heads, and the little girl in her last move was stretching out her hands to her dead grandmother. Shocked, Romanov even forgot about his camera, but after recovering from the shock started filming.

However, not a single copy of such a leaflet has been provided to Memorial's observers in support of this assertion. Likewise, no traces of such leaflets have been found by Memorial's observers in Khojaly. When interviewed, Khojaly refugees said that they had not heard about such leaflets. Several days prior to the assault, the representatives of the Armenian side had, on repeated occasions, informed the Khojaly authorities by radio about the upcoming assault and urged them to immediately evacuate the population from the town. The fact that this information had been received by the Azerbaijani side and transferred to Baku is confirmed by Baku newspapers (Bakinskiy Rabochiy)<ref name=EynullaCase/>}}\n\nArmenian fighters claimed to HRW investigators that they sent ultimata to the Azerbaijani forces in Khojaly warning that unless missile attacks from that town on Stepanakert ceased, Armenian forces would attack. The report quotes the testimony of an Azerbaijani woman: \"According to A.H., an Azerbaijani woman interviewed by Helsinki Watch in Baky, \"After Armenians seized Malybeyli, they made an ultimatum to Khojaly... and that Khojaly people had better leave with white flag.

People left in two directions: (1) from the east side of the town northeastwards along the river, passing [[Askeran (town)|Askeran]] to their left (this route, according to Armenian officials, was provided as a \"free corridor\"); (2) from the north side of the town northeastwards, passing Askeran to their right (it appears that fewer refugees fled using this route). Thus, the majority of civilians left Khojaly, while around 200\u2013300 people stayed in Khojaly, hiding in their houses and basements. As a result of the shelling of the town, an unascertained number of civilians were killed in Khojaly during the assault. The Armenian side practically refused to tell Memorial observers how many people so perished. The refugees in both groups were fired upon, as a result of which many of them were killed. Those who remained alive dispersed. Running refugees came across Armenian military posts and were fired upon. Some refugees managed to escape to Agdam, some, mainly women and children (the exact number is impossible to determine), froze to death while wandering around in mountains, some were captured near the villages of Nakhichevanik and Pirjamal.<ref name=\"memo.ru\"/>\n\n[[Helsinki Watch]] reported that \"the militia, still in uniform, and some still carrying their guns, were interspersed with the masses of civilians\" and according to eyewitness accounts there was shooting between Armenian and the Azerbaijani forces which were mixed with the civilians.<ref>Helsinki Watch.

Human Rights Watch noted that \"the attacking party [i.e., Karabakh Armenian forces] is still obliged to take precautionary measures to avoid or minimize civilian casualties. In particular, the party must suspend an attack if it becomes apparent that the attack may be expected to cause civilian casualties that are excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated. The circumstances surrounding the attack at Nakhichevanik on those fleeing from Khojaly indicate that Armenian forces and the troops of the 366th CIS regiment (who were not apparently acting on orders from their commanders) deliberately disregarded this customary law restraint on attacks\".<ref name=\"hrw\">{{cite web |url=http://hrw.org/english/docs/1997/03/24/azerba16933.htm |title=Letter to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Armenia from the Executive Director of Human Rights Watch dated March 24, 1997 |publisher=Hrw.org |date=24 March 1997 |accessdate=28 April 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906155003/http://hrw.org/english/docs/1997/03/24/azerba16933.htm |archivedate=6 September 2008  }}</ref><ref name=\"Helsinki 1992. pp. 24\">Human Rights Watch/Helsinki.

According to members of the Armenian armed forces, the Azerbaijani forces attempted to battle through from Agdam in the direction of the 'free corridor'. At the moment when the Armenian outposts were fighting off this attack, the first groups of Khojaly refugees approached them from the rear. The armed people who were among the refugees began firing at the Armenian outposts. During the battle, one outpost was destroyed, but the fighters from another outpost, of whose existence the Azerbaijanis were unaware, opened fire from a close distance at the people coming from Khojaly. According to testimonies of Khojaly refugees (including those published in the press), the armed people inside the refugee column did exchange gunfire with Armenian outposts, but on each occasion the fire was opened first from the Armenian side.}}\n\nThe site of the mass killing of Khojaly inhabitants was filmed on videotape by Azerbaijani journalist [[Chingiz Mustafayev]]. He was accompanied by the Russian journalist Yuri Romanov during the first helicopter flight to the scene of the tragedy. Romanov described in his memoir how he looked out of the window of the helicopter and literally jumped back from an incredibly horrible view. The whole area up to the horizon was covered with dead bodies of women, elderly people and boys and girls of all ages, from newly born to teenagers. From the mass of bodies two figures caught his sight. An old woman with uncovered gray head was lying face down next to a small girl in a blue jacket. Their legs were tied with barbed wire, and the old woman's hands were tied as well. Both were shot in their heads, and the little girl in her last move was stretching out her hands to her dead grandmother. Shocked, Romanov even forgot about his camera, but after recovering from the shock started filming.

However, not a single copy of such a leaflet has been provided to Memorial's observers in support of this assertion. Likewise, no traces of such leaflets have been found by Memorial's observers in Khojaly. When interviewed, Khojaly refugees said that they had not heard about such leaflets. Several days prior to the assault, the representatives of the Armenian side had, on repeated occasions, informed the Khojaly authorities by radio about the upcoming assault and urged them to immediately evacuate the population from the town.
