This, however, was solely experimental and was yet to be ruled by technical or legal regulations. The shots ranged from mug shot resemblances, to prisoners in their cells; and the purpose of them also varied from documentation to experimentation. There was no training required and pictures were often taken by [[amateurs]], [[commercial photographer]]s, and even policemen or prison officials.\n\nBy the 1870s, the practice had spread to many countries, though limited to larger cities. Professional photographers would then be employed to take posed [[portraits]] of the criminals. This was early evidence that led to the standard mug shot known today and was unlike any previously known portraiture. Though there was no set standard yet, there was rarely creativity employed with [[lighting]] or [[angle]]. This was not like photographing portraits of families or children. These were documenting criminals. It was one of the first times people saw portraiture being used for something other than [[art]]. Though these were slowly adapted to [[police regulations]], photographing criminals and suspects was widespread until the latter part of the 19th century, when the process of having one's picture taken and archived was limited to individuals convicted of serious offenses. This was, of course, by discretion of the police.\n\nAs the number of criminals climbed, so too did the number of photographs. Organizing and storing the [[archives]] became a problem. Collections called, \"[[Rogues gallery|Rogues Galleries]]\" classified criminals according to types of offenses. The earliest evidence of these galleries was found in [[Birmingham]], England in the 1850s. Shortly after this were initial attempts at standardizing the photographs.\n\n== Alphonse Bertillon==\nFrench photographer, [[Alphonse Bertillon]] was the first to realize that photographs were futile for identification if they were not standardized by using the same lighting, scale and angles.<ref>Platt, Richard. ''Forensics''. Ed. Jennifer Schofield. Boston: Kingfisher Publications, 2005.</ref>   He wanted to replace traditional photographic documentation of criminals with a system that would guarantee reliable identification. He suggested [[anthropological studies]] of profiles and full-face shots to identify criminals. He published La Photographie Judiciaire (1890), which contained rules for a scientifically exact form of identification photography. He stated that the subjects should be well lit, photographed full face and also in profile, with the ear visible. Bertillon maintained that the precepts of [[commercial portraits]] should be forgotten in this type of photography. By the turn of the century, both his measurement system and photographic rules had been accepted and introduced in almost all states. Thus, Bertillon is credited with the invention of the mug shot. \n\nSome people believe that Bertillon's methods were influenced by crude [[Darwinian]] ideas and attempted to confirm assumptions that criminals were physically distinguishable from law-abiding citizens. It is speculated in the article, \"Most Wanted Photography,\" that it is from this system that many of the stereotype looks (skin color, eye color, hair color, body type and more) of criminals in movies, books and comics were founded.<ref>''Economist''. \"Most-Wanted Photography.\" Vol. 346, Issue 8054. 1998.</ref>   Although the measurement system was soon replaced by [[fingerprinting]], the method of standardized photographs survived.\n\n== Crime photography ==\nOn the other side of the spectrum of forensic photography, is the crime photography that involves documenting the scene of the crime, rather than the criminal. Though this type of forensic photography was also created for the purpose of documenting, identifying and convicting, it allows more room for creative interpretation and variance of style. It includes taking pictures of the victim (scars, wounds, birthmarks, etc.) for the purpose of identification or conviction; and pictures of the scene (placement of objects, position of body, photos of evidence and fingerprints). The development of this type of forensic photography is responsible for radical changes in the field, including public involvement (crime photos appearing in the newspaper) and new interpretations and purposes of the field.\n\nBertillon was also the first to methodically photograph and document crime scenes. He did this both at ground level and overhead, which he called \"God's-eye-view.\" While his mug shots encourage people to find differences (from themselves) in physical characteristics of criminals, his crime scene photographs revealed similarities to the public. This made people question, when looking in a newspaper at pictures of a murder that took place in a home that resembles their own, \"could this happen to me?\"<ref>''Economist''. \"Most-Wanted Photography.\" Vol. 346, Issue 8054. 1998.</ref>  For the first time, people other than criminologists, police or forensic photographers were seeing the effects of crime through forensic photography.\n\n== Weegee ==\nAmong the more famous, and arguably the most famous crime photographer, is Arthur Fellig, better known as \"[[Weegee]]\". He was known for routinely arriving at crime scenes before other reporters, or often even before the police, The nickname is speculated to come from an alternate spelling of the word \"[[Ouija]]\", implying that Fellig had a supernatural force telling where the action was going to occur. His first exhibition was a solo exhibition, entitled, \"[[Weegee: Murder is My Business]]\" and showed in 1941 at the [[Photo League]] in New York. [[The Museum of Modern Art]] purchased five of his photos and showed them in an exhibit called \"Action Photography.\" Forensic photography had now transcended mere documentation. It was considered an art. Weegee did not consider his photos art, but many perceived them that way. He is a prime example of the different purposes of forensic photography. His photographs were intended as documentation and were viewed that way in the paper by many people, but were shown in museums and seen as art by many others.

Males had a median income of $26,944 versus $18,229 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the city was $13,202. About 18.2% of families and 26.7% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 32.9% of those under age 18 and 34.3% of those age 65.\n\n== History ==\nCarved out of parts of Sevier County and Hempstead County, Little River County was established in 1867 by an act of the Arkansas legislature. The new county gave citizens a shorter and easier journey to their county seat of government. Because of the area's close proximity to the Little River, which flows into the Red River near Texarkana (Miller County), it took the name of Little River County. This county is located in the southwest corner of the state and is surrounded by Sevier, Hempstead, Howard, and Miller counties in Arkansas and by counties in Texas and Oklahoma. The two rivers form major parts of the boundary of Little River County.\n\nThe land in and around Little River County is rich and fertile. It contains an abundance of lime formations in some areas near White Cliffs, Okay, and Foreman. In 1893, because of the available limestone, the Western Portland Cement Company once thrived at White Cliffs, though now only its ruins exist. Much later, because of the track of limestone running through Little River County, Sevier County, and Hempstead County, Ideal Cement Company was built in Okay. It made a quality cement for years but was later sold to a German company which did not want to make the costly repairs that were needed. At the same time that Ideal Cement Company was operating full scale, Foreman Cement Company, owned by Arkansas Louisiana Gas Company, was producing an abundance of quality cement. Eventually, Foreman Cement Company became the leading producer of cement in the southwest region of Arkansas. Today, it is still a thriving plant owned by Ash Grove Cement Company of Kansas City, Kansas.\n\n=== Louisiana Purchase through the Gilded Age ===\nSome Caddo settlements existed in the area that would become Little River County, but the Caddo moved south out of the Great Bend area by 1778. The land continued to be regarded as Caddo territory, though, until a treaty in 1835. A [[Quapaw]] reservation also included parts of southwest Arkansas between 1820 and 1825, but that land eventually was exchanged for lands west of the territorial border. Even before treaties with the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] were signed, white settlers were squatting on the land, and after the completion of these treaties, more settlements and communities developed.\n\nPioneers had already begun settling in the area in the early 1800s. The first town to be plotted was Laynesport in 1836, on land donated for development by Benjamin Layne. By 1845, Willow Springs, later renamed Rocky Comfort, in the western part of the county, began to flourish, and by 1854, the community of Richmond had begun to thrive.\n\nAs they did throughout America, people suffered during the Civil War. They often experienced mental anguish and hardships because of the loss of lives and financial security. People in the South suspended raising cotton while other products were produced for the war efforts. Many lost property and experienced displacement.\n\nAfter the legal establishment of Little River County in 1867, the first courthouse and jail in the county were located near the area that is now known as Alleene on land owned by the first sheriff, William M. Freeman. In 1868, Powell Clayton, governor of Arkansas, had all county records moved to established headquarters in Rocky Comfort.\n\nIn 1880, citizens of Richmond built a new courthouse. The property on which the courthouse was to be built was deeded to the county on the condition that Richmond would remain the county seat. After this courthouse burned, citizens of Richmond built another courthouse at no cost to the county because they wanted to keep the county seat in Richmond.\n\n=== Early Twentieth Century ===\nIn 1902, the county seat was moved from Richmond to Foreman, formerly called Rocky Comfort. Foreman and Ashdown later competed for the county seat. When an election was held in 1906, Ashdown won the most votes to become the new county seat. After this election, records were moved from Foreman to a vacant building, known as the Mizell Building. A new courthouse was constructed in Ashdown in 1907.\n\nOn October 24, 1929, the New York stock market crash brought about the Great Depression. Little River County citizens suffered in much the same way as people in the rest of the country. Farms were lost, wages decreased, and unemployment increased. By 1932, income had dropped to one third of what it had been before October 1929. Many farmers were forced to sell their property during the 1930s. For years, the county's principal source of income was agriculture. Cotton was the leading crop, and most of the early communities had cotton gins. Corn was the second-largest crop, but soon the timber industry would become the leading industry in the county. Many of the small settlements in Little River County were located near sawmills, cotton gins, or rivers.\n\nThe construction of railroads had a definite impact on the development of some towns and the decline of others. Little River County had its first railroad in 1889. In 1895, the Arkansas and Choctaw Railroad from Ashdown to Arkinda was built. The Kansas City Southern Railroad began running three new fast-freight locomotives with larger engines capable of pulling 100 loaded freight cars. With these modern engines, goods could more easily be transported, making the tough economic times in the 1930s more bearable. The presence of the Kansas City Southern Railroad, the St. Louis/San Francisco Railroad and the Memphis/Dallas and Gulf Railroad caused the county to grow rapidly. Before the construction of railroads, the rivers were used to transport goods by way of ferries, steamboats, and flatboats. Passenger trains began operating in the county in the late 1890s. After the emergence of railroads, electrical and telephone services became available to parts of the county by 1912, and natural gas came into Ashdown in 1930.\n\n=== World War II through Modern Era ===\nBy 1950, manufacturing plants began to change the economy. The development of Millwood Lake in 1965 was of major importance to the county's industrial growth. Access to water was a necessity for industry, and Ashdown's rivers and lake provided plenty. Nekoosa Paper Mill was built in Ashdown in 1968 because of its access to the Red River. The plant was sold to Georgia-Pacific in 1991 and to Domtar Industries in 2001. Presently, the timber industry is paramount in Ashdown; Domtar Industries is a major employer there. Another key company, generating millions of dollars for the county, is Ash Grove Cement Company in Foreman. It was built in 1956, but it is presently under new construction because it has proven to be a very profitable plant.\n\nAfter the paper mill and the cement company came to Little River County, many citizens prospered. They began many building projects, including medical facilities. In 1958, the present Little River Memorial Hospital was constructed in Ashdown, and as of 2006, there are two nursing facilities and a retirement center. A new high school building, replacing the 1954 building, is under construction and is expected to be completed by 2007.\n\nA modern bridge was constructed in 1980 over the Red River to replace the Index Bridge, built in 1919. Four-lane highways have encouraged easy access to Texarkana, now only a twenty-minute drive from Ashdown, which now has a bypass bridge to shorten the distance from Foreman to Texarkana.\n\nAshdown is home to the Cossatot Community College of the University of Arkansas. Millwood Lake and Millwood State Park are well known for trophy fishing contests and camping sites and sports facilities. The county courthouse is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and it draws many tourists each Christmas season when the entire courthouse and its dome are covered in lights. Nine other properties are on the National Register, including the Hunter/Coulter House in Ashdown, the Will Reed House in Alleene, and the New Rocky Comfort House in Foreman. Ashdown recently established the Two Rivers Museum, which is a favorite tourist site, sponsored by the Little River County Historical Society.\n\n== Education ==\nPublic educatIon for elementary and secondary students is provided by the Foreman School District, including [[Foreman High School (Arkansas)|Foreman High School]] (grades 7 through 12) and Foreman Elementary School (kindergarten through sixth grade).\n\n==Notable people==\n* [[Marion H.

The median age was 39 years. For every 100 females, there were 84.4 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 79.4 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the city was $22,176, and the median income for a family was $29,231. Males had a median income of $26,944 versus $18,229 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the city was $13,202. About 18.2% of families and 26.7% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 32.9% of those under age 18 and 34.3% of those age 65.\n\n== History ==\nCarved out of parts of Sevier County and Hempstead County, Little River County was established in 1867 by an act of the Arkansas legislature. The new county gave citizens a shorter and easier journey to their county seat of government. Because of the area\u2019s close proximity to the Little River, which flows into the Red River near Texarkana (Miller County), it took the name of Little River County. This county is located in the southwest corner of the state and is surrounded by Sevier, Hempstead, Howard, and Miller counties in Arkansas and by counties in Texas and Oklahoma. The two rivers form major parts of the boundary of Little River County.\n\nThe land in and around Little River County is rich and fertile. It contains an abundance of lime formations in some areas near White Cliffs, Okay, and Foreman. In 1893, because of the available limestone, the Western Portland Cement Company once thrived at White Cliffs, though now only its ruins exist. Much later, because of the track of limestone running through Little River County, Sevier County, and Hempstead County, Ideal Cement Company was built in Okay. It made a quality cement for years but was later sold to a German company which did not want to make the costly repairs that were needed. At the same time that Ideal Cement Company was operating full scale, Foreman Cement Company, owned by Arkansas Louisiana Gas Company, was producing an abundance of quality cement. Eventually, Foreman Cement Company became the leading producer of cement in the southwest region of Arkansas. Today, it is still a thriving plant owned by Ash Grove Cement Company of Kansas City, Kansas.\n\n=== Louisiana Purchase through the Gilded Age ===\nSome Caddo settlements existed in the area that would become Little River County, but the Caddo moved south out of the Great Bend area by 1778. The land continued to be regarded as Caddo territory, though, until a treaty in 1835. A [[Quapaw]] reservation also included parts of southwest Arkansas between 1820 and 1825, but that land eventually was exchanged for lands west of the territorial border. Even before treaties with the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] were signed, white settlers were squatting on the land, and after the completion of these treaties, more settlements and communities developed.\n\nPioneers had already begun settling in the area in the early 1800s. The first town to be plotted was Laynesport in 1836, on land donated for development by Benjamin Layne. By 1845, Willow Springs, later renamed Rocky Comfort, in the western part of the county, began to flourish, and by 1854, the community of Richmond had begun to thrive.\n\nAs they did throughout America, people suffered during the Civil War. They often experienced mental anguish and hardships because of the loss of lives and financial security. People in the South suspended raising cotton while other products were produced for the war efforts. Many lost property and experienced displacement.\n\nAfter the legal establishment of Little River County in 1867, the first courthouse and jail in the county were located near the area that is now known as Alleene on land owned by the first sheriff, William M. Freeman. In 1868, Powell Clayton, governor of Arkansas, had all county records moved to established headquarters in Rocky Comfort.\n\nIn 1880, citizens of Richmond built a new courthouse. The property on which the courthouse was to be built was deeded to the county on the condition that Richmond would remain the county seat. After this courthouse burned, citizens of Richmond built another courthouse at no cost to the county because they wanted to keep the county seat in Richmond.\n\n=== Early Twentieth Century ===\nIn 1902, the county seat was moved from Richmond to Foreman, formerly called Rocky Comfort. Foreman and Ashdown later competed for the county seat. When an election was held in 1906, Ashdown won the most votes to become the new county seat. After this election, records were moved from Foreman to a vacant building, known as the Mizell Building. A new courthouse was constructed in Ashdown in 1907.\n\nOn October 24, 1929, the New York stock market crash brought about the Great Depression. Little River County citizens suffered in much the same way as people in the rest of the country. Farms were lost, wages decreased, and unemployment increased. By 1932, income had dropped to one third of what it had been before October 1929. Many farmers were forced to sell their property during the 1930s. For years, the county\u2019s principal source of income was agriculture. Cotton was the leading crop, and most of the early communities had cotton gins. Corn was the second-largest crop, but soon the timber industry would become the leading industry in the county. Many of the small settlements in Little River County were located near sawmills, cotton gins, or rivers.\n\nThe construction of railroads had a definite impact on the development of some towns and the decline of others. Little River County had its first railroad in 1889. In 1895, the Arkansas and Choctaw Railroad from Ashdown to Arkinda was built. The Kansas City Southern Railroad began running three new fast-freight locomotives with larger engines capable of pulling 100 loaded freight cars. With these modern engines, goods could more easily be transported, making the tough economic times in the 1930s more bearable. The presence of the Kansas City Southern Railroad, the St. Louis/San Francisco Railroad and the Memphis/Dallas and Gulf Railroad caused the county to grow rapidly. Before the construction of railroads, the rivers were used to transport goods by way of ferries, steamboats, and flatboats. Passenger trains began operating in the county in the late 1890s. After the emergence of railroads, electrical and telephone services became available to parts of the county by 1912, and natural gas came into Ashdown in 1930.\n\n=== World War II through Modern Era ===\nBy 1950, manufacturing plants began to change the economy. The development of Millwood Lake in 1965 was of major importance to the county\u2019s industrial growth. Access to water was a necessity for industry, and Ashdown\u2019s rivers and lake provided plenty. Nekoosa Paper Mill was built in Ashdown in 1968 because of its access to the Red River. The plant was sold to Georgia-Pacific in 1991 and to Domtar Industries in 2001. Presently, the timber industry is paramount in Ashdown; Domtar Industries is a major employer there. Another key company, generating millions of dollars for the county, is Ash Grove Cement Company in Foreman. It was built in 1956, but it is presently under new construction because it has proven to be a very profitable plant.\n\nAfter the paper mill and the cement company came to Little River County, many citizens prospered. They began many building projects, including medical facilities. In 1958, the present Little River Memorial Hospital was constructed in Ashdown, and as of 2006, there are two nursing facilities and a retirement center. A new high school building, replacing the 1954 building, is under construction and is expected to be completed by 2007.\n\nA modern bridge was constructed in 1980 over the Red River to replace the Index Bridge, built in 1919. Four-lane highways have encouraged easy access to Texarkana, now only a twenty-minute drive from Ashdown, which now has a bypass bridge to shorten the distance from Foreman to Texarkana.\n\nAshdown is home to the Cossatot Community College of the University of Arkansas. Millwood Lake and Millwood State Park are well known for trophy fishing contests and camping sites and sports facilities. The county courthouse is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and it draws many tourists each Christmas season when the entire courthouse and its dome are covered in lights. Nine other properties are on the National Register, including the Hunter/Coulter House in Ashdown, the Will Reed House in Alleene, and the New Rocky Comfort House in Foreman. Ashdown recently established the Two Rivers Museum, which is a favorite tourist site, sponsored by the Little River County Historical Society.\n\n== Education ==\nPublic educatIon for elementary and secondary students is provided by the Foreman School District, including [[Foreman High School (Arkansas)|Foreman High School]] (grades 7 through 12) and Foreman Elementary School (kindergarten through sixth grade).\n\n==Notable people==\n* [[Marion H.

During its introduction, it was described simply as \"Objective-C without the C\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/news/527821/apple-seeks-a-swift-way-to-lure-more-developers|title=Apple Seeks a Swift Way to Lure More Developers|first1=Rachel|last1=Metz|date=June 3, 2014|publisher=[[Technology Review]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/06/02/apple-introduces-a-new-programming-language-swift-objective-c-without-the-c/|title=Apple announces 'Swift,' a new programming language for macOS & iOS|first1=Harrison|last1=Weber|date=June 2, 2014|publisher=[[VentureBeat]]}}</ref>\n\nBy default, Swift does not expose pointers and other [[Memory safety|unsafe]] [[Mutator method|accessors]], in contrast to Objective-C, which uses pointers pervasively to refer to object instances. Also, Objective-C's use of a [[Smalltalk]]-like syntax for making [[method call]]s has been replaced with a dot-notation style and [[namespace]] system more familiar to programmers from other common [[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented]] (OO) languages like [[Java (programming language)|Java]] or [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]]. Swift introduces true [[named parameter]]s and retains key Objective-C concepts, including [[Protocol (object-oriented programming)|protocols]], [[Closure (computer programming)|closures]] and [[Objective-C#Categories|categories]], often replacing former syntax with cleaner versions and allowing these concepts to be applied to other language structures, like [[enumerated type]]s (enums)<ref>{{cite web | url=https://themindstudios.com/blog/advantages-of-using-swift-over-objective-c/ | title=Advantages Of Using Swift | website=themindstudios.com | accessdate=February 24, 2017}}</ref>\n=== Closure Support===\nSwift supports closures (known as lambdas in other languages). Here is an example:\n\n<source lang=\"swift\" line=\"1\" start=\"1\">/// Here is a closure\n{(arg1: Int, arg2: Int) -> Int in\nreturn arg1 + arg2\n}</source>\nSwift has a trailing closure syntax like this:\n<source lang=\"swift\" line=\"1\" start=\"1\"> // This function takes a closure or function that returns an int and then just evaluates the function.\nfunc a(closure a: () -> Int) -> Int {\nreturn a()\n}\n\n/// Without trailing closure syntax\n\na(closure: {return 1})\n\n/// With trailing closure syntax\na {return 1} </source>\nYou must omit the parameter names.\n\n'''Here is criteria for the trailing closure syntax:'''\n\n# If the function only has one parameter and it is a closure you can use the trailing closure syntax\n# If the parameter at the end is a closure than you can use the trailing closure syntax\n\n=== String support===\nUnder the [[Cocoa (API)|Cocoa]] and [[Cocoa Touch]] environments, many common classes were part of the [[Foundation Kit]] library. This included the NSString string library (using [[Unicode]]), the NSArray and NSDictionary collection classes, and others. Objective-C provided various bits of [[syntactic sugar]] to allow some of these objects to be created on-the-fly within the language, but once created, the objects were manipulated with object calls. For instance, in Objective-C concatenating two NSStrings required method calls similar to this: \n \n<source lang=\"objc\">NSString *str = @\"hello,\";\nstr = [str stringByAppendingString:@\" world\"];</source> In Swift, many of these basic types have been promoted to the language's core, and can be manipulated directly. For instance, strings are invisibly bridged to NSString (when Foundation is imported) and can now be concatenated with the <code>+</code> operator, allowing greatly simplified syntax; the prior example becoming:<ref>{{cite web|title=Strings and Characters|url=https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/swift/conceptual/swift_programming_language/StringsAndCharacters.html|website=developer.apple.com|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]|accessdate=July 16, 2014}}</ref>\n\n<source lang=\"swift\">var str = \"hello,\"\nstr += \" world\"</source>\n\n=== Access control ===\nSwift supports five [[Encapsulation (object-oriented programming)|access control]] levels for symbols: <code>open</code>, <code>public</code>, <code>internal</code>, <code>fileprivate</code>, and <code>private</code>. Unlike many object-oriented languages, these access controls ignore [[inheritance (object-oriented programming)|inheritance]] hierarchies: <code>private</code> indicates that a symbol is accessible only in the immediate scope, <code>fileprivate</code> indicates it is accessible only from within the file, <code>internal</code> indicates it is accessible within the containing module, <code>public</code> indicates it is accessible from any module, and <code>open</code> (only for classes and their methods) indicates that the class may be subclassed outside of the module.<ref>{{cite web|title=Access Control|url=https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/AccessControl.html|website=developer.apple.com|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]|accessdate=October 25, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Optionals and chaining ===\nAn important new feature in Swift is [[option type]]s, which allow [[Reference (computer science)|references]] or values to operate in a manner similar to the common pattern in [[C (programming language)|C]], where a [[Pointer (computer programming)|pointer]] may refer to a value or may be null. This implies that non-optional types cannot result in a [[Pointer (computer programming)#Making pointers safer|null-pointer error]]; the compiler can ensure this is not possible.\n\nOptional types are created with the <code>Optional</code> mechanism\u2014to make an Integer that is nullable, one would use a declaration similar to <code>var optionalInteger: Optional<Int></code>. As in C#,<ref>[https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/1t3y8s4s.aspx \"Nullable Types\"], C# Programming Guide, Microsoft.</ref> Swift also includes syntactic sugar for this, allowing one to indicate a variable is optional by placing a question mark after the type name, <code>var optionalInteger: Int?</code>.<ref>{{cite web |title=Types |url=https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/swift/conceptual/swift_programming_language/Types.html |website=developer.apple.com |publisher=[[Apple Inc.]] |accessdate=July 16, 2014}}</ref> Variables or constants that are marked optional either have a value of the underlying type or are <code>nil</code>. Optional types ''wrap'' the base type, resulting in a different instance. <code>String</code> and <code>String?</code> are fundamentally different types, the latter has more in common with <code>Int?</code> than <code>String</code>.\n\nTo access the value inside, assuming it is not nil, it must be ''unwrapped'' to expose the instance inside. This is performed with the <code>!</code> operator:\n\n<source lang=\"swift\">\nlet myValue = anOptionalInstance!.someMethod()\n</source>\n\nIn this case, the <code>!</code> operator unwraps <code>anOptionalInstance</code> to expose the instance inside, allowing the method call to be made on it. If <code>anOptionalInstance</code> is nil, a null-pointer error occurs. This can be annoying in practice, so Swift also includes the concept of [[Safe navigation operator|optional chaining]] to test whether the instance is nil and then unwrap it if it is non-null:\n\n<source lang=\"swift\">\nlet myValue = anOptionalInstance?.someMethod()\n</source>\n\nIn this case the runtime only calls <code>someMethod</code> if <code>anOptionalInstance</code> is not nil, suppressing the error. Normally this requires the programmer to test whether <code>myValue</code> is nil before proceeding. The origin of the term ''chaining'' comes from the more common case where several method calls/getters are chained together. For instance:\n\n<source lang=\"swift\">\nlet aTenant = aBuilding.TenantList[5]\nlet theirLease = aTenant.leaseDetails\nlet leaseStart = theirLease?.startDate\n</source>\n\ncan be reduced to:\n\n<source lang=\"swift\">\nlet leaseStart = aBuilding.TenantList[5].leaseDetails?.startDate\n</source>\n\nThe <code>?</code> syntax circumvents the [[Pyramid of doom (programming)|pyramid of doom]].\n\nSwift 2 introduced the new keyword <code>guard</code> for cases in which code should stop executing if some condition is unmet:\n\n<source lang=\"swift\">\nguard let leaseStart = aBuilding.TenantList[5]?.leaseDetails?.startDate else\n{\n    //handle the error case where anything in the chain is nil\n    //else scope must exit the current method or loop\n}\n//continue, knowing that leaseStart is not nil\n</source>\n\nUsing <code>guard</code> has three benefits. While the syntax can act as an <code>if</code> statement, its primary benefit is inferring non-nullability. Where an <code>if</code> statement requires a case, <code>guard</code> assumes the case based on the condition provided. Also, since <code>guard</code> contains no scope, with exception of the <code>else</code> closure, <code>leaseStart</code> is presented as an unwrapped optional to the guard's super-scope. Lastly, if the <code>guard</code> statement's test fails, Swift requires the <code>else</code> to exit the current method or loop, ensuring <code>leaseStart</code> never is accessed when <code>nil</code>. This is performed with the keywords <code>return</code>, <code>continue</code>, <code>break</code>, or <code>throw</code>.\n\nObjective-C was weakly typed and allowed any method to be called on any object at any time. If the method call failed, there was a default handler in the runtime that returned nil. That meant that no unwrapping or testing was needed, the equivalent statement in Objective-C:\n\n<source lang=\"objective-c\">\nleaseStart = [[[aBuilding tenantList:5] leaseDetails] startDate]\n</source>\n\nWould return nil, and this could be tested. However, this also demanded that all method calls be dynamic, which introduces significant overhead. Swift's use of optionals provides a similar mechanism for testing and dealing with nils, but does so in a way that allows the compiler to use static dispatch because the unwrapping action is called on a defined instance (the wrapper), versus occurring in the runtime dispatch system.\n\n=== Value types ===\nIn many object-oriented languages, objects are represented internally in two parts. The object is stored as a block of data placed on the [[Heap (data structure)|heap]], while the name (or \"handle\") to that object is represented by a [[Pointer (computer programming)|pointer]]. Objects are passed between methods by copying the value of the pointer, allowing the same underlying data on the heap to be accessed by anyone with a copy. In contrast, basic types like integers and floating-point values are represented directly; the handle contains the data, not a pointer to it, and that data is passed directly to methods by copying. These styles of access are termed ''pass-by-reference'' in the case of objects, and ''pass-by-value'' for basic types.\n\nBoth concepts have their advantages and disadvantages. Objects are useful when the data is large, like the description of a window or the contents of a document. In these cases, access to that data is provided by copying a 32- or 64-bit value, versus copying an entire data structure. However, smaller values like integers are the same size as pointers (typically both are one [[Word (computer architecture)|word]]), so there is no advantage to passing a pointer, versus passing the value. Also, pass-by-reference inherently requires a dereferencing operation, which can produce noticeable overhead in some operations, typically those used with these basic value types, like mathematics.\n\nSimilarly to C# and in contrast to most other OO languages,{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Swift offers built-in support for objects using either pass-by-reference or pass-by-value semantics, the former using the <code>class</code> declaration and the latter using <code>struct</code>. Structs in Swift have almost all the same features as classes: methods, implementing protocols and using the extension mechanisms. For this reason, Apple terms all data generically as ''instances'', versus objects or values. Structs do not support inheritance, however.<ref name=classesstructs>{{cite web |url=https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/ClassesAndStructures.html |title= Classes and Structures |website=Apple.com}}</ref>\n\nThe programmer is free to choose which semantics are more appropriate for each data structure in the application. Larger structures like windows would be defined as classes, allowing them to be passed around as pointers. Smaller structures, like a 2D point, can be defined as structs, which will be pass-by-value and allow direct access to their internal data with no dereference. The performance improvement inherent to the pass-by-value concept is such that Swift uses these types for almost all common data types, including <code>Int</code> and <code>Double</code>, and types normally represented by objects, like <code>String</code> and <code>Array</code>.<ref name=classesstructs/> Using value types can result in significant performance improvements in user applications as well.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://medium.com/@fielgood/swift-1-1-swift-1-2-and-objective-c-a-performance-case-study-d86f7a333e2a |title=Performance Case Study on Swift 1.1, Swift 1.2, and Objective-C |first=Fiel |last=Guhit}}</ref>\n\nTo ensure that even the largest structs do not cause a performance penalty when they are handed off, Swift uses [[copy on write]] so that the objects are copied only if and when the program attempts to change a value in them. This means that the various accessors have what is in effect a pointer to the same data storage. So while the data is physically stored as one instance in memory, at the level of the application, these values are separate and physical separation is enforced by copy on write only if needed.<ref>{{cite AV media |url=https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2015/?id=414 |title=Building Better Apps with Value Types |publisher=Apple}}</ref>\n\n=== Protocol-oriented programming ===\nA key feature of Objective-C is its support for ''categories'', methods that can be added to extend classes at runtime. Categories allow extending classes in-place to add new functions with no need to subclass or even have access to the original [[source code]]. An example might be to add [[spell checker]] support to the base <code>NSString</code> class, which means all instances of NSString in the application gain spell checking. The system is also widely used as an organizational technique, allowing related code to be gathered into library-like extensions. Swift continues to support this concept, although they are now termed ''extensions'', and declared with the keyword <code>extension</code>. Unlike Objective-C, Swift can also add new properties accessors, types, and enums to extant instances {{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}.\n\nAnother key feature of Objective-C is its use of [[Protocol (object-oriented programming)|''protocols'']], known in most modern languages as ''interfaces''. Protocols promise that a particular class implements a set of methods, meaning that other objects in the system can call those methods on any object supporting that protocol. This is often used in modern OO languages as a substitute for [[multiple inheritance]], although the feature sets are not entirely similar. A common example of a protocol in Cocoa is the <code>NSCopying</code> protocol, which defines one method, <code>copyWithZone</code>, that implements [[object copying#deep copy|deep copying]] on objects.<ref name=protocols>{{cite web |url=https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Protocols/NSCopying_Protocol/index.html |title= NSCopying Protocol Reference |website=Apple}}</ref>\n\nIn Objective-C, and most other languages implementing the protocol concept, it is up to the programmer to ensure that the required methods are implemented in each class.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/WorkingwithProtocols/WorkingwithProtocols.html |title=Working with Protocols |website=Apple}}</ref> Swift adds the ability to add these methods using extensions, and to use [[generic programming]] (generics) to implement them. Combined, these allow protocols to be written once and support a wide variety of instances. Also, the extension mechanism can be used to add protocol conformance to an object that does not list that protocol in its definition.<ref name=protocols/>\n\nFor example, a protocol might be declared called <code>StringConvertible</code>, which ensures that instances that conform to the protocol implement a <code>toString</code> method that returns a <code>String</code>. In Swift, this can be declared with code like this:\n<source lang=\"swift\">\nprotocol StringConvertible\n{\n    func toString() -> String\n}\n</source>\nThis protocol can now be added to String, with no access to the base class's source:\n<source lang=\"swift\">\nextension String: StringConvertible\n{\n    func toString() -> String\n    {\n        self\n    }\n}\n</source>\n\nIn Swift, like many modern languages supporting interfaces, protocols can be used as types, which means variables and methods can be defined by protocol instead of their specific type:\n\n<source lang=\"Swift\">\nvar someSortOfPrintableObject: StringConvertible\n...\nprint(someSortOfPrintableObject.toString())\n</source>\n\nIt does not matter what sort of instance <code>someSortOfPrintableObject</code> is, the compiler will ensure that it conforms to the protocol and thus this code is safe. This syntax also means that collections can be based on protocols also, like <code>let printableArray = [StringConvertible]</code>.\n\nAs Swift treats structs and classes as similar concepts, both extensions and protocols are extensively used in Swift's runtime to provide a rich API based on structs. For instance, Swift uses an extension to add the <code>Equatable</code> protocol to many of their basic types, like Strings and Arrays, allowing them to be compared with the <code>==</code> operator. A concrete example of how all of these features interact can be seen in the concept of ''default protocol implementations'':\n<source lang=\"Swift\">\nfunc !=<T : Equatable>(lhs: T, rhs: T) -> Bool\n</source>\nThis function defines a method that works on any instance conforming to <code>Equatable</code>, providing a ''not equals'' function. Any instance, class or struct, automatically gains this implementation simply by conforming to <code>Equatable</code>. As many instances gain <code>Equatable</code> through their base implementations or other generic extensions, most basic objects in the runtime gain equals and not equals with no code.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nshipster.com/swift-default-protocol-implementations/ |title=Swift Default Protocol Implementations |website=NSHipster |first=Mattt |last=Thompson |date=September 2, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThis combination of protocols, defaults, protocol inheritance, and extensions allows many of the functions normally associated with classes and inheritance to be implemented on value types.<ref name=protocols/> Properly used, this can lead to dramatic performance improvements with no significant limits in API. This concept is so widely used within Swift, that Apple has begun calling it a ''protocol-oriented programming language''. They suggest addressing many of the problem domains normally solved though classes and inheritance using protocols and structs instead.\n\n=== Libraries, runtime and development ===\nOn Apple systems, Swift uses the same runtime as the extant [[Objective-C]] system, but requires iOS 7 or macOS 10.9 or higher. It also depends on [[Grand Central Dispatch]].<ref>[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24001778/do-swift-based-apps-work-on-os-x-10-9-ios-7-and-lower/24038997#24038997 \"Do Swift-based apps work on macOS 10.9/iOS 7 and lower?\"], StackOverflow</ref> Swift and Objective-C code can be used in one program, and by extension, C and C++ also. In contrast to C, [[C++]] code cannot be used directly from Swift. An Objective-C or C wrapper must be created between Swift and C++.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/BuildingCocoaApps/index.html|title=Using Swift with Cocoa and Objective-C: Basic Setup|date=January 6, 2015|work=apple.com}}</ref> In the case of Objective-C, Swift has considerable access to the object model, and can be used to subclass, extend and use Objective-C code to provide protocol support.<ref>[https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/BuildingCocoaApps/WritingSwiftClassesWithObjective-CBehavior.html \"Writing Swift Classes with Objective-C Behavior\"], Apple Inc.</ref> The converse is not true: a Swift class cannot be subclassed in Objective-C.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/BuildingCocoaApps/Migration.html|title=Migrating Your Objective-C Code to Swift}}</ref>\n\nTo aid development of such programs, and the re-use of extant code, Xcode 6 and higher offers a semi-automated system that builds and maintains a ''bridging header'' to expose Objective-C code to Swift. This takes the form of an additional [[header file]] that simply defines or imports all of the Objective-C symbols that are needed by the project's Swift code. At that point, Swift can refer to the types, functions, and variables declared in those imports as though they were written in Swift. Objective-C code can also use Swift code directly, by importing an automatically maintained header file with Objective-C declarations of the project's Swift symbols. For instance, an Objective-C file in a mixed project called \"MyApp\" could access Swift classes or functions with the code <code>#import \"MyApp-Swift.h\"</code>. Not all symbols are available through this mechanism, however\u2014use of Swift-specific features like generic types, non-object optional types, sophisticated enums, or even Unicode identifiers may render a symbol inaccessible from Objective-C.<ref>[https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/BuildingCocoaApps/MixandMatch.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014216-CH10-XID_77 \"Swift and Objective-C in the Same Project\"], Apple Inc.</ref>\n\nSwift also has limited support for ''attributes'', metadata that is read by the development environment, and is not necessarily part of the compiled code. Like Objective-C, attributes use the <code>@</code> syntax, but the currently available set is small. One example is the <code>@IBOutlet</code> attribute, which marks a given value in the code as an ''outlet'', available for use within [[Interface Builder]] (IB). An ''outlet'' is a device that binds the value of the on-screen display to an object in code.\n\nOn non-Apple systems, Swift does not depend on an Objective-C runtime or other Apple system libraries; a set of Swift \"Corelib\" implementations replace them. These include a \"swift-corelibs-foundation\" to stand in for the [[Foundation Kit]], a \"swift-corelibs-libdispatch\" to stand in for the Grand Central Dispatch, and an \"swift-corelibs-xctest\" to stand in for the XCTest APIs from [[XCode]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Apple: search \"corelib\" |url=https://github.com/apple?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=corelibs&type=&language= |website=GitHub |language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== Memory management ===\nSwift uses [[Automatic Reference Counting]] (ARC) to [[Memory management|manage memory]]. Apple used to require manual memory management in Objective-C, but introduced ARC in 2011 to allow for easier memory allocation and deallocation.<ref>[https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/AutomaticReferenceCounting.html \"Automatic Reference Counting\"], Apple Inc.</ref> One problem with ARC is the possibility of creating a ''[[Reference counting#reference cycle|strong reference cycle]]'', where objects reference each other in a way that you can reach the object you started from by following references (e.g. A references B, B references A). This causes them to become leaked into memory as they are never released. Swift provides the keywords <code>weak</code> and <code>unowned</code> to prevent strong reference cycles. Typically a parent-child relationship would use a strong reference while a child-parent would use either <code>weak</code> reference, where parents and children can be unrelated, or <code>unowned</code> where a child always has a parent, but parent may not have a child. Weak references must be optional variables, since they can change and become <code>nil</code>.<ref name=\"Intermediate Swift\">{{cite web|last1=Lanier|first1=Brian|last2=Groff|first2=Joe|title=Intermediate Swift|url=https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2014/?include=403#403|publisher=Apple|accessdate=July 3, 2014}}</ref>\n\nA closure within a class can also create a strong reference cycle by capturing self references. Self references to be treated as weak or unowned can be indicated using a ''capture list.''\n\n=== Debugging and other elements ===\nA key element of the Swift system is its ability to be cleanly debugged and run within the development environment, using a [[read\u2013eval\u2013print loop]] (REPL), giving it interactive properties more in common with the scripting abilities of Python than traditional [[system programming]] languages. The REPL is further enhanced with the new concept ''[[Swift Playgrounds|playgrounds]]''. These are interactive views running within the Xcode environment that respond to code or debugger changes on-the-fly.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Metz|first1=Cade|title=Why Coders Are Going Nuts Over Apple's New Programming Language|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/06/apple-swift-language/|publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|accessdate=July 16, 2014}}</ref> [[Swift Playgrounds|Playgrounds]] allow programmers to add in Swift code along with markdown documentation. If some code changes over time or with regard to some other ranged input value, the view can be used with the Timeline Assistant to demonstrate the output in an animated way. In addition, Xcode has debugging features for Swift development including breakpoints, step through and step over statements, as well as UI element placement breakdowns for app developers.\n\nApple says that Swift is \"an industrial-quality programming language that's as expressive and enjoyable as a scripting language\".<ref>[https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/ About Swift], Apple Inc.</ref>\n\n=== Performance ===\nMany of the features introduced with Swift have well-known performance and safety trade-offs. Apple has implemented [[Optimizing compiler|optimizations]] that reduce this overhead.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2015/409/ |title=Optimizing Swift Performance |publisher=Apple, Inc. |date=June 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Comparisons to other languages ==\n\nSwift is similar to C in various ways:\n\n* Most C operators are used in Swift, but there are some new operators, for example to support integer operations with overflow (see under differences).\n* [[Curly braces]] are used to group statements.\n* Variables are assigned using an [[equals sign]], but compared using [[==|two consecutive equals signs]]. A new identity operator, ===, is provided to check if two data elements refer to the same [[Pointer (computing)|object]].\n* Control statements <code>while</code>, <code>if</code>, and <code>switch</code> are similar, but have extended functions, e.g., a <code>switch</code> that takes non-integer cases, <code>while</code> and <code>if</code> supporting pattern matching and conditionally unwrapping optionals, etc.\n* [[Square brackets]] are used with [[Array data structure|arrays]], both to declare them and to get a value at a given index in one of them.\n\nIt also has similarities to Objective-C:\n\n* Basic numeric types (<code>Int, UInt, Float, Double</code>)\n* Class methods are inherited, like instance methods; <code>self</code> in class methods is the class the method was called on.\n* Similar <code>for</code>...<code>in</code> enumeration syntax.\n\nDifferences from Objective-C include:\n\n* Statements do not need to end with semicolons (<code>;</code>), though these must be used to allow more than one statement on a line.\n* No header files.\n* Uses [[type inference]].\n* [[Generic programming]].\n* Functions are [[first class function|first-class]] objects.\n* Enumeration cases can have associated data ([[algebraic data type]]s).\n* Operators can be redefined for classes ([[operator overloading]]), and new operators can be defined.\n* Strings fully support [[Unicode]]. Most Unicode characters can be used in either identifiers or operators.\n* No [[exception handling]]. Swift 2 introduces a different and incompatible error-handling model.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://stackoverflow.com/a/26749528|title=Error-Handling in Swift-Language|work=stackoverflow.com}}</ref>\n* Several notoriously error-prone behaviors of earlier [[List of C-family programming languages|C-family languages]] have been changed:\n** [[Pointer (computer programming)|Pointers]] are not exposed by default. There is no need for the programmer to keep track of and mark names for referencing or dereferencing.\n** Assignments return no value. This prevents the common error of writing <code>i = 0</code> instead of <code>i == 0</code> by throwing a compile-time error.\n** No need to use <code>break</code> statements in <code>[[Switch statement|switch]]</code> blocks. Individual cases do not fall through to the next case unless the <code>fallthrough</code> statement is used.\n** Variables and constants are always initialized and array bounds are always checked.\n** [[Integer overflow]]s, which result in [[undefined behavior]] for signed integers in C, are trapped as a run-time error in Swift. Programmers can choose to allow overflows by using the special arithmetical operators <code>&+</code>, <code>&-</code>, <code>&*</code>, <code>&/</code> and <code>&%</code>. The properties <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> are defined in Swift for all integer types and can be used to safely check for potential overflows, versus relying on constants defined for each type in external libraries.\n** The one-statement form of <code>if</code> and <code>while</code>, which allows for the omission of braces around the statement, is unsupported.\n** C-style enumeration <code>for (int i = 0; i < c; i++)</code>, which is prone to [[off-by-one error]]s, is unsupported (from Swift 3 onward).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0007-remove-c-style-for-loops.md|title=apple/swift-evolution|website=GitHub|access-date=April 4, 2016}}</ref>\n** The pre- and post- [[increment and decrement operators]] (<code>i++</code>, <code>--i</code> ...) are unsupported (from Swift 3 onward), more so since C-style <code>for</code> statements are also unsupported from Swift 3 onward.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0004-remove-pre-post-inc-decrement.md|title=apple/swift-evolution|website=GitHub|access-date=April 4, 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Development and other implementations ==\nSince the language is open-source, there are prospects of it being ported to the web.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://9to5mac.com/2016/02/22/ibm-swift-cloud-kitura/|title=IBM brings Swift to the cloud, releases web framework Kitura written in Apple\u2019s programming language|last=Barbosa|first=Greg|date=February 22, 2016|website=9to5Mac|access-date=May 16, 2016}}</ref> Some web frameworks have already been developed, such as [[IBM]]'s [[Kitura]], [[Perfect (server framework)|Perfect]] and [[Vapor (Server-side Swift)|Vapor]].\n\nAn official \"Server APIs\" work group has also been started by Apple,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://swift.org/blog/server-api-workgroup/|title=Server APIs Work Group|last=Inc.|first=Apple|date=October 25, 2016|newspaper=Swift.org|access-date=October 28, 2016}}</ref> with members of the Swift developer community playing a central role.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://swift.org/server-apis/|title=Swift.org|last=Inc.|first=Apple|website=Swift.org|access-date=October 28, 2016}}</ref>\n\nA second free implementation of Swift that targets [[Cocoa (API)|Cocoa]], [[Microsoft]]'s [[Common Language Infrastructure]] ([[.NET Framework|.NET]]), and the [[Java (software platform)|Java]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] platform exists as part of the ''Elements Compiler'' from [[RemObjects Software]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = RemObjects Elements Compiler|url = http://www.elementscompiler.com/silver|accessdate = January 17, 2016}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Computer programming}}\n\n* [[Comparison of programming languages]]\n* [[Objective-C]]\n* [[Kotlin (programming language)]]\n* [[Python (programming language)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official website}}\n* [https://developer.apple.com/swift/ Swift] at [[Apple Developer]]\n* {{GitHub|apple/swift|Swift's source code}}\n* [https://developer.ibm.com/swift/ Server-side Swift]\n*[https://iosexample.com/ Swift Example]\n* [https://vapor.codes/ Server-side Swift -

During its introduction, it was described simply as \"Objective-C without the C\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/news/527821/apple-seeks-a-swift-way-to-lure-more-developers|title=Apple Seeks a Swift Way to Lure More Developers|first1=Rachel|last1=Metz|date=June 3, 2014|publisher=[[Technology Review]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/06/02/apple-introduces-a-new-programming-language-swift-objective-c-without-the-c/|title=Apple announces 'Swift,' a new programming language for macOS & iOS|first1=Harrison|last1=Weber|date=June 2, 2014|publisher=[[VentureBeat]]}}</ref>\n\nBy default, Swift does not expose pointers and other [[Memory safety|unsafe]] [[Mutator method|accessors]], in contrast to Objective-C, which uses pointers pervasively to refer to object instances. Also, Objective-C's use of a [[Smalltalk]]-like syntax for making [[method call]]s has been replaced with a dot-notation style and [[namespace]] system more familiar to programmers from other common [[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented]] (OO) languages like [[Java (programming language)|Java]] or [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]]. Swift introduces true [[named parameter]]s and retains key Objective-C concepts, including [[Protocol (object-oriented programming)|protocols]], [[Closure (computer programming)|closures]] and [[Objective-C#Categories|categories]], often replacing former syntax with cleaner versions and allowing these concepts to be applied to other language structures, like [[enumerated type]]s (enums)<ref>{{cite web | url=https://themindstudios.com/blog/advantages-of-using-swift-over-objective-c/ | title=Advantages Of Using Swift | website=themindstudios.com | accessdate=February 24, 2017}}</ref>\n=== Closure Support===\nSwift supports closures (known as lambdas in other languages). Here is an example:\n\n<source lang=\"swift\" line=\"1\" start=\"1\">/// Here is a closure\n{(arg1: Int, arg2: Int) -> Int in\nreturn arg1 + arg2\n}</source>\nSwift has a trailing closure syntax like this:\n<source lang=\"swift\" line=\"1\" start=\"1\"> // This function takes a closure or function that returns an int and then just evaluates the function.\nfunc a(closure a: () -> Int) -> Int {\nreturn a()\n}\n\n/// Without trailing closure syntax\n\na(closure: {return 1})\n\n/// With trailing closure syntax\na {return 1} </source>\nYou must omit the parameter names.\n\n'''Here is criteria for the trailing closure syntax:'''\n\n# If the function only has one parameter and it is a closure you can use the trailing closure syntax\n# If the parameter at the end is a closure than you can use the trailing closure syntax\n\n=== String support===\nUnder the [[Cocoa (API)|Cocoa]] and [[Cocoa Touch]] environments, many common classes were part of the [[Foundation Kit]] library. This included the NSString string library (using [[Unicode]]), the NSArray and NSDictionary collection classes, and others. Objective-C provided various bits of [[syntactic sugar]] to allow some of these objects to be created on-the-fly within the language, but once created, the objects were manipulated with object calls. For instance, in Objective-C concatenating two NSStrings required method calls similar to this: \n \n<source lang=\"objc\">NSString *str = @\"hello,\";\nstr = [str stringByAppendingString:@\" world\"];</source> In Swift, many of these basic types have been promoted to the language's core, and can be manipulated directly. For instance, strings are invisibly bridged to NSString (when Foundation is imported) and can now be concatenated with the <code>+</code> operator, allowing greatly simplified syntax; the prior example becoming:<ref>{{cite web|title=Strings and Characters|url=https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/swift/conceptual/swift_programming_language/StringsAndCharacters.html|website=developer.apple.com|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]|accessdate=July 16, 2014}}</ref>\n\n<source lang=\"swift\">var str = \"hello,\"\nstr += \" world\"</source>\n\n=== Access control ===\nSwift supports five [[Encapsulation (object-oriented programming)|access control]] levels for symbols: <code>open</code>, <code>public</code>, <code>internal</code>, <code>fileprivate</code>, and <code>private</code>. Unlike many object-oriented languages, these access controls ignore [[inheritance (object-oriented programming)|inheritance]] hierarchies: <code>private</code> indicates that a symbol is accessible only in the immediate scope, <code>fileprivate</code> indicates it is accessible only from within the file, <code>internal</code> indicates it is accessible within the containing module, <code>public</code> indicates it is accessible from any module, and <code>open</code> (only for classes and their methods) indicates that the class may be subclassed outside of the module.<ref>{{cite web|title=Access Control|url=https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/AccessControl.html|website=developer.apple.com|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]|accessdate=October 25, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Optionals and chaining ===\nAn important new feature in Swift is [[option type]]s, which allow [[Reference (computer science)|references]] or values to operate in a manner similar to the common pattern in [[C (programming language)|C]], where a [[Pointer (computer programming)|pointer]] may refer to a value or may be null. This implies that non-optional types cannot result in a [[Pointer (computer programming)#Making pointers safer|null-pointer error]]; the compiler can ensure this is not possible.\n\nOptional types are created with the <code>Optional</code> mechanism\u2014to make an Integer that is nullable, one would use a declaration similar to <code>var optionalInteger: Optional<Int></code>. As in C#,<ref>[https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/1t3y8s4s.aspx \"Nullable Types\"], C# Programming Guide, Microsoft.</ref> Swift also includes syntactic sugar for this, allowing one to indicate a variable is optional by placing a question mark after the type name, <code>var optionalInteger: Int?</code>.<ref>{{cite web |title=Types |url=https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/swift/conceptual/swift_programming_language/Types.html |website=developer.apple.com |publisher=[[Apple Inc.]] |accessdate=July 16, 2014}}</ref> Variables or constants that are marked optional either have a value of the underlying type or are <code>nil</code>. Optional types ''wrap'' the base type, resulting in a different instance. <code>String</code> and <code>String?</code> are fundamentally different types, the latter has more in common with <code>Int?</code> than <code>String</code>.\n\nTo access the value inside, assuming it is not nil, it must be ''unwrapped'' to expose the instance inside. This is performed with the <code>!</code> operator:\n\n<source lang=\"swift\">\nlet myValue = anOptionalInstance!.someMethod()\n</source>\n\nIn this case, the <code>!</code> operator unwraps <code>anOptionalInstance</code> to expose the instance inside, allowing the method call to be made on it. If <code>anOptionalInstance</code> is nil, a null-pointer error occurs. This can be annoying in practice, so Swift also includes the concept of [[Safe navigation operator|optional chaining]] to test whether the instance is nil and then unwrap it if it is non-null:\n\n<source lang=\"swift\">\nlet myValue = anOptionalInstance?.someMethod()\n</source>\n\nIn this case the runtime only calls <code>someMethod</code> if <code>anOptionalInstance</code> is not nil, suppressing the error. Normally this requires the programmer to test whether <code>myValue</code> is nil before proceeding. The origin of the term ''chaining'' comes from the more common case where several method calls/getters are chained together. For instance:\n\n<source lang=\"swift\">\nlet aTenant = aBuilding.TenantList[5]\nlet theirLease = aTenant.leaseDetails\nlet leaseStart = theirLease?.startDate\n</source>\n\ncan be reduced to:\n\n<source lang=\"swift\">\nlet leaseStart = aBuilding.TenantList[5].leaseDetails?.startDate\n</source>\n\nThe <code>?</code> syntax circumvents the [[Pyramid of doom (programming)|pyramid of doom]].\n\nSwift 2 introduced the new keyword <code>guard</code> for cases in which code should stop executing if some condition is unmet:\n\n<source lang=\"swift\">\nguard let leaseStart = aBuilding.TenantList[5]?.leaseDetails?.startDate else\n{\n    //handle the error case where anything in the chain is nil\n    //else scope must exit the current method or loop\n}\n//continue, knowing that leaseStart is not nil\n</source>\n\nUsing <code>guard</code> has three benefits. While the syntax can act as an <code>if</code> statement, its primary benefit is inferring non-nullability. Where an <code>if</code> statement requires a case, <code>guard</code> assumes the case based on the condition provided. Also, since <code>guard</code> contains no scope, with exception of the <code>else</code> closure, <code>leaseStart</code> is presented as an unwrapped optional to the guard's super-scope. Lastly, if the <code>guard</code> statement's test fails, Swift requires the <code>else</code> to exit the current method or loop, ensuring <code>leaseStart</code> never is accessed when <code>nil</code>. This is performed with the keywords <code>return</code>, <code>continue</code>, <code>break</code>, or <code>throw</code>.\n\nObjective-C was weakly typed and allowed any method to be called on any object at any time. If the method call failed, there was a default handler in the runtime that returned nil. That meant that no unwrapping or testing was needed, the equivalent statement in Objective-C:\n\n<source lang=\"objective-c\">\nleaseStart = [[[aBuilding tenantList:5] leaseDetails] startDate]\n</source>\n\nWould return nil, and this could be tested. However, this also demanded that all method calls be dynamic, which introduces significant overhead. Swift's use of optionals provides a similar mechanism for testing and dealing with nils, but does so in a way that allows the compiler to use static dispatch because the unwrapping action is called on a defined instance (the wrapper), versus occurring in the runtime dispatch system.\n\n=== Value types ===\nIn many object-oriented languages, objects are represented internally in two parts. The object is stored as a block of data placed on the [[Heap (data structure)|heap]], while the name (or \"handle\") to that object is represented by a [[Pointer (computer programming)|pointer]]. Objects are passed between methods by copying the value of the pointer, allowing the same underlying data on the heap to be accessed by anyone with a copy. In contrast, basic types like integers and floating-point values are represented directly; the handle contains the data, not a pointer to it, and that data is passed directly to methods by copying. These styles of access are termed ''pass-by-reference'' in the case of objects, and ''pass-by-value'' for basic types.\n\nBoth concepts have their advantages and disadvantages. Objects are useful when the data is large, like the description of a window or the contents of a document. In these cases, access to that data is provided by copying a 32- or 64-bit value, versus copying an entire data structure. However, smaller values like integers are the same size as pointers (typically both are one [[Word (computer architecture)|word]]), so there is no advantage to passing a pointer, versus passing the value. Also, pass-by-reference inherently requires a dereferencing operation, which can produce noticeable overhead in some operations, typically those used with these basic value types, like mathematics.\n\nSimilarly to C# and in contrast to most other OO languages,{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Swift offers built-in support for objects using either pass-by-reference or pass-by-value semantics, the former using the <code>class</code> declaration and the latter using <code>struct</code>. Structs in Swift have almost all the same features as classes: methods, implementing protocols and using the extension mechanisms. For this reason, Apple terms all data generically as ''instances'', versus objects or values. Structs do not support inheritance, however.<ref name=classesstructs>{{cite web |url=https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/ClassesAndStructures.html |title= Classes and Structures |website=Apple.com}}</ref>\n\nThe programmer is free to choose which semantics are more appropriate for each data structure in the application. Larger structures like windows would be defined as classes, allowing them to be passed around as pointers. Smaller structures, like a 2D point, can be defined as structs, which will be pass-by-value and allow direct access to their internal data with no dereference. The performance improvement inherent to the pass-by-value concept is such that Swift uses these types for almost all common data types, including <code>Int</code> and <code>Double</code>, and types normally represented by objects, like <code>String</code> and <code>Array</code>.<ref name=classesstructs/> Using value types can result in significant performance improvements in user applications as well.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://medium.com/@fielgood/swift-1-1-swift-1-2-and-objective-c-a-performance-case-study-d86f7a333e2a |title=Performance Case Study on Swift 1.1, Swift 1.2, and Objective-C |first=Fiel |last=Guhit}}</ref>\n\nTo ensure that even the largest structs do not cause a performance penalty when they are handed off, Swift uses [[copy on write]] so that the objects are copied only if and when the program attempts to change a value in them. This means that the various accessors have what is in effect a pointer to the same data storage. So while the data is physically stored as one instance in memory, at the level of the application, these values are separate and physical separation is enforced by copy on write only if needed.<ref>{{cite AV media |url=https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2015/?id=414 |title=Building Better Apps with Value Types |publisher=Apple}}</ref>\n\n=== Protocol-oriented programming ===\nA key feature of Objective-C is its support for ''categories'', methods that can be added to extend classes at runtime. Categories allow extending classes in-place to add new functions with no need to subclass or even have access to the original [[source code]]. An example might be to add [[spell checker]] support to the base <code>NSString</code> class, which means all instances of NSString in the application gain spell checking. The system is also widely used as an organizational technique, allowing related code to be gathered into library-like extensions. Swift continues to support this concept, although they are now termed ''extensions'', and declared with the keyword <code>extension</code>. Unlike Objective-C, Swift can also add new properties accessors, types, and enums to extant instances {{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}.\n\nAnother key feature of Objective-C is its use of [[Protocol (object-oriented programming)|''protocols'']], known in most modern languages as ''interfaces''. Protocols promise that a particular class implements a set of methods, meaning that other objects in the system can call those methods on any object supporting that protocol. This is often used in modern OO languages as a substitute for [[multiple inheritance]], although the feature sets are not entirely similar. A common example of a protocol in Cocoa is the <code>NSCopying</code> protocol, which defines one method, <code>copyWithZone</code>, that implements [[object copying#deep copy|deep copying]] on objects.<ref name=protocols>{{cite web |url=https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Protocols/NSCopying_Protocol/index.html |title= NSCopying Protocol Reference |website=Apple}}</ref>\n\nIn Objective-C, and most other languages implementing the protocol concept, it is up to the programmer to ensure that the required methods are implemented in each class.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/WorkingwithProtocols/WorkingwithProtocols.html |title=Working with Protocols |website=Apple}}</ref> Swift adds the ability to add these methods using extensions, and to use [[generic programming]] (generics) to implement them. Combined, these allow protocols to be written once and support a wide variety of instances. Also, the extension mechanism can be used to add protocol conformance to an object that does not list that protocol in its definition.<ref name=protocols/>\n\nFor example, a protocol might be declared called <code>StringConvertible</code>, which ensures that instances that conform to the protocol implement a <code>toString</code> method that returns a <code>String</code>. In Swift, this can be declared with code like this:\n<source lang=\"swift\">\nprotocol StringConvertible\n{\n    func toString() -> String\n}\n</source>\nThis protocol can now be added to String, with no access to the base class's source:\n<source lang=\"swift\">\nextension String: StringConvertible\n{\n    func toString() -> String\n    {\n        self\n    }\n}\n</source>\n\nIn Swift, like many modern languages supporting interfaces, protocols can be used as types, which means variables and methods can be defined by protocol instead of their specific type:\n\n<source lang=\"Swift\">\nvar someSortOfPrintableObject: StringConvertible\n...\nprint(someSortOfPrintableObject.toString())\n</source>\n\nIt does not matter what sort of instance <code>someSortOfPrintableObject</code> is, the compiler will ensure that it conforms to the protocol and thus this code is safe. This syntax also means that collections can be based on protocols also, like <code>let printableArray = [StringConvertible]</code>.\n\nAs Swift treats structs and classes as similar concepts, both extensions and protocols are extensively used in Swift's runtime to provide a rich API based on structs. For instance, Swift uses an extension to add the <code>Equatable</code> protocol to many of their basic types, like Strings and Arrays, allowing them to be compared with the <code>==</code> operator. A concrete example of how all of these features interact can be seen in the concept of ''default protocol implementations'':\n<source lang=\"Swift\">\nfunc !=<T : Equatable>(lhs: T, rhs: T) -> Bool\n</source>\nThis function defines a method that works on any instance conforming to <code>Equatable</code>, providing a ''not equals'' function. Any instance, class or struct, automatically gains this implementation simply by conforming to <code>Equatable</code>. As many instances gain <code>Equatable</code> through their base implementations or other generic extensions, most basic objects in the runtime gain equals and not equals with no code.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nshipster.com/swift-default-protocol-implementations/ |title=Swift Default Protocol Implementations |website=NSHipster |first=Mattt |last=Thompson |date=September 2, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThis combination of protocols, defaults, protocol inheritance, and extensions allows many of the functions normally associated with classes and inheritance to be implemented on value types.<ref name=protocols/> Properly used, this can lead to dramatic performance improvements with no significant limits in API. This concept is so widely used within Swift, that Apple has begun calling it a ''protocol-oriented programming language''. They suggest addressing many of the problem domains normally solved though classes and inheritance using protocols and structs instead.\n\n=== Libraries, runtime and development ===\nOn Apple systems, Swift uses the same runtime as the extant [[Objective-C]] system, but requires iOS 7 or macOS 10.9 or higher. It also depends on [[Grand Central Dispatch]].<ref>[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24001778/do-swift-based-apps-work-on-os-x-10-9-ios-7-and-lower/24038997#24038997 \"Do Swift-based apps work on macOS 10.9/iOS 7 and lower?\"], StackOverflow</ref> Swift and Objective-C code can be used in one program, and by extension, C and C++ also. In contrast to C, [[C++]] code cannot be used directly from Swift. An Objective-C or C wrapper must be created between Swift and C++.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/BuildingCocoaApps/index.html|title=Using Swift with Cocoa and Objective-C: Basic Setup|date=January 6, 2015|work=apple.com}}</ref> In the case of Objective-C, Swift has considerable access to the object model, and can be used to subclass, extend and use Objective-C code to provide protocol support.<ref>[https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/BuildingCocoaApps/WritingSwiftClassesWithObjective-CBehavior.html \"Writing Swift Classes with Objective-C Behavior\"], Apple Inc.</ref> The converse is not true: a Swift class cannot be subclassed in Objective-C.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/BuildingCocoaApps/Migration.html|title=Migrating Your Objective-C Code to Swift}}</ref>\n\nTo aid development of such programs, and the re-use of extant code, Xcode 6 and higher offers a semi-automated system that builds and maintains a ''bridging header'' to expose Objective-C code to Swift. This takes the form of an additional [[header file]] that simply defines or imports all of the Objective-C symbols that are needed by the project's Swift code. At that point, Swift can refer to the types, functions, and variables declared in those imports as though they were written in Swift. Objective-C code can also use Swift code directly, by importing an automatically maintained header file with Objective-C declarations of the project's Swift symbols. For instance, an Objective-C file in a mixed project called \"MyApp\" could access Swift classes or functions with the code <code>#import \"MyApp-Swift.h\"</code>. Not all symbols are available through this mechanism, however\u2014use of Swift-specific features like generic types, non-object optional types, sophisticated enums, or even Unicode identifiers may render a symbol inaccessible from Objective-C.<ref>[https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/BuildingCocoaApps/MixandMatch.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014216-CH10-XID_77 \"Swift and Objective-C in the Same Project\"], Apple Inc.</ref>\n\nSwift also has limited support for ''attributes'', metadata that is read by the development environment, and is not necessarily part of the compiled code. Like Objective-C, attributes use the <code>@</code> syntax, but the currently available set is small. One example is the <code>@IBOutlet</code> attribute, which marks a given value in the code as an ''outlet'', available for use within [[Interface Builder]] (IB). An ''outlet'' is a device that binds the value of the on-screen display to an object in code.\n\nOn non-Apple systems, Swift does not depend on an Objective-C runtime or other Apple system libraries; a set of Swift \"Corelib\" implementations replace them. These include a \"swift-corelibs-foundation\" to stand in for the [[Foundation Kit]], a \"swift-corelibs-libdispatch\" to stand in for the Grand Central Dispatch, and an \"swift-corelibs-xctest\" to stand in for the XCTest APIs from [[XCode]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Apple: search \"corelib\" |url=https://github.com/apple?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=corelibs&type=&language= |website=GitHub |language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== Memory management ===\nSwift uses [[Automatic Reference Counting]] (ARC) to [[Memory management|manage memory]]. Apple used to require manual memory management in Objective-C, but introduced ARC in 2011 to allow for easier memory allocation and deallocation.<ref>[https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/AutomaticReferenceCounting.html \"Automatic Reference Counting\"], Apple Inc.</ref> One problem with ARC is the possibility of creating a ''[[Reference counting#reference cycle|strong reference cycle]]'', where objects reference each other in a way that you can reach the object you started from by following references (e.g. A references B, B references A). This causes them to become leaked into memory as they are never released. Swift provides the keywords <code>weak</code> and <code>unowned</code> to prevent strong reference cycles. Typically a parent-child relationship would use a strong reference while a child-parent would use either <code>weak</code> reference, where parents and children can be unrelated, or <code>unowned</code> where a child always has a parent, but parent may not have a child. Weak references must be optional variables, since they can change and become <code>nil</code>.<ref name=\"Intermediate Swift\">{{cite web|last1=Lanier|first1=Brian|last2=Groff|first2=Joe|title=Intermediate Swift|url=https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2014/?include=403#403|publisher=Apple|accessdate=July 3, 2014}}</ref>\n\nA closure within a class can also create a strong reference cycle by capturing self references. Self references to be treated as weak or unowned can be indicated using a ''capture list.''\n\n=== Debugging and other elements ===\nA key element of the Swift system is its ability to be cleanly debugged and run within the development environment, using a [[read\u2013eval\u2013print loop]] (REPL), giving it interactive properties more in common with the scripting abilities of Python than traditional [[system programming]] languages. The REPL is further enhanced with the new concept ''[[Swift Playgrounds|playgrounds]]''. These are interactive views running within the Xcode environment that respond to code or debugger changes on-the-fly.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Metz|first1=Cade|title=Why Coders Are Going Nuts Over Apple's New Programming Language|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/06/apple-swift-language/|publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|accessdate=July 16, 2014}}</ref> [[Swift Playgrounds|Playgrounds]] allow programmers to add in Swift code along with markdown documentation. If some code changes over time or with regard to some other ranged input value, the view can be used with the Timeline Assistant to demonstrate the output in an animated way. In addition, Xcode has debugging features for Swift development including breakpoints, step through and step over statements, as well as UI element placement breakdowns for app developers.\n\nApple says that Swift is \"an industrial-quality programming language that's as expressive and enjoyable as a scripting language\".<ref>[https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/ About Swift], Apple Inc.</ref>\n\n=== Performance ===\nMany of the features introduced with Swift also have well-known performance and safety trade-offs. Apple has implemented [[Optimizing compiler|optimizations]] that reduce this overhead.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2015/409/ |title=Optimizing Swift Performance |publisher=Apple, Inc. |date=June 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Comparisons to other languages ==\n\nSwift is similar to C in various ways:\n\n* Most C operators are used in Swift, but there are some new operators, for example to support integer operations with overflow (see under differences).\n* [[Curly braces]] are used to group statements.\n* Variables are assigned using an [[equals sign]], but compared using [[==|two consecutive equals signs]]. A new identity operator, ===, is provided to check if two data elements refer to the same [[Pointer (computing)|object]].\n* Control statements <code>while</code>, <code>if</code>, and <code>switch</code> are similar, but have extended functions, e.g., a <code>switch</code> that takes non-integer cases, <code>while</code> and <code>if</code> supporting pattern matching and conditionally unwrapping optionals, etc.\n* [[Square brackets]] are used with [[Array data structure|arrays]], both to declare them and to get a value at a given index in one of them.\n\nIt also has similarities to Objective-C:\n\n* Basic numeric types (<code>Int, UInt, Float, Double</code>)\n* Class methods are inherited, like instance methods; <code>self</code> in class methods is the class the method was called on.\n* Similar <code>for</code>...<code>in</code> enumeration syntax.\n\nDifferences from Objective-C include:\n\n* Statements do not need to end with semicolons (<code>;</code>), though these must be used to allow more than one statement on a line.\n* No header files.\n* Uses [[type inference]].\n* [[Generic programming]].\n* Functions are [[first class function|first-class]] objects.\n* Enumeration cases can have associated data ([[algebraic data type]]s).\n* Operators can be redefined for classes ([[operator overloading]]), and new operators can be defined.\n* Strings fully support [[Unicode]]. Most Unicode characters can be used in either identifiers or operators.\n* No [[exception handling]]. Swift 2 introduces a different and incompatible error-handling model.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://stackoverflow.com/a/26749528|title=Error-Handling in Swift-Language|work=stackoverflow.com}}</ref>\n* Several notoriously error-prone behaviors of earlier [[List of C-family programming languages|C-family languages]] have been changed:\n** [[Pointer (computer programming)|Pointers]] are not exposed by default. There is no need for the programmer to keep track of and mark names for referencing or dereferencing.\n** Assignments return no value. This prevents the common error of writing <code>i = 0</code> instead of <code>i == 0</code> by throwing a compile-time error.\n** No need to use <code>break</code> statements in <code>[[Switch statement|switch]]</code> blocks. Individual cases do not fall through to the next case unless the <code>fallthrough</code> statement is used.\n** Variables and constants are always initialized and array bounds are always checked.\n** [[Integer overflow]]s, which result in [[undefined behavior]] for signed integers in C, are trapped as a run-time error in Swift. Programmers can choose to allow overflows by using the special arithmetical operators <code>&+</code>, <code>&-</code>, <code>&*</code>, <code>&/</code> and <code>&%</code>. The properties <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> are defined in Swift for all integer types and can be used to safely check for potential overflows, versus relying on constants defined for each type in external libraries.\n** The one-statement form of <code>if</code> and <code>while</code>, which allows for the omission of braces around the statement, is unsupported.\n** C-style enumeration <code>for (int i = 0; i < c; i++)</code>, which is prone to [[off-by-one error]]s, is unsupported (from Swift 3 onward).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0007-remove-c-style-for-loops.md|title=apple/swift-evolution|website=GitHub|access-date=April 4, 2016}}</ref>\n** The pre- and post- [[increment and decrement operators]] (<code>i++</code>, <code>--i</code> ...) are unsupported (from Swift 3 onward), more so since C-style <code>for</code> statements are also unsupported from Swift 3 onward.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0004-remove-pre-post-inc-decrement.md|title=apple/swift-evolution|website=GitHub|access-date=April 4, 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Development and other implementations ==\nSince the language is open-source, there are prospects of it being ported to the web.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://9to5mac.com/2016/02/22/ibm-swift-cloud-kitura/|title=IBM brings Swift to the cloud, releases web framework Kitura written in Apple\u2019s programming language|last=Barbosa|first=Greg|date=February 22, 2016|website=9to5Mac|access-date=May 16, 2016}}</ref> Some web frameworks have already been developed, such as [[IBM]]'s [[Kitura]], [[Perfect (server framework)|Perfect]] and [[Vapor (Server-side Swift)|Vapor]].\n\nAn official \"Server APIs\" work group has also been started by Apple,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://swift.org/blog/server-api-workgroup/|title=Server APIs Work Group|last=Inc.|first=Apple|date=October 25, 2016|newspaper=Swift.org|access-date=October 28, 2016}}</ref> with members of the Swift developer community playing a central role.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://swift.org/server-apis/|title=Swift.org|last=Inc.|first=Apple|website=Swift.org|access-date=October 28, 2016}}</ref>\n\nA second free implementation of Swift that targets [[Cocoa (API)|Cocoa]], [[Microsoft]]'s [[Common Language Infrastructure]] ([[.NET Framework|.NET]]), and the [[Java (software platform)|Java]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] platform exists as part of the ''Elements Compiler'' from [[RemObjects Software]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = RemObjects Elements Compiler|url = http://www.elementscompiler.com/silver|accessdate = January 17, 2016}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Computer programming}}\n\n* [[Comparison of programming languages]]\n* [[Objective-C]]\n* [[Kotlin (programming language)]]\n* [[Python (programming language)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official website}}\n* [https://developer.apple.com/swift/ Swift] at [[Apple Developer]]\n* {{GitHub|apple/swift|Swift's source code}}\n* [https://developer.ibm.com/swift/ Server-side Swift]\n*[https://iosexample.com/ Swift Example]\n* [https://vapor.codes/ Server-side Swift - The Vapor Framework]\n* [https://developer.ibm.com/mainframe/products/ibm-toolkit-swift-z-os/ Swift for IBM z/OS]\n* [https://www.ibm.com/us-en/marketplace/swift-compiler Swift for Linux on z Systems]\n\n{{Programming languages}}\n{{Apple Software}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Apple Inc. software]]\n[[Category:Computer-related introductions in 2014]]\n[[Category:Object-oriented programming languages]]\n[[Category:Pattern matching programming languages]]\n[[Category:Programming languages]]\n[[Category:Programming languages created in 2014]]\n[[Category:Software using the Apache license]]\n[[Category:Statically typed programming languages]]\n[[Category:Systems programming languages]]\n", "name_user": "Oleg Alexandrov", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePerformance:rm unneeded word", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language)"}

He is currently a part of [[Salzburger AK 1914]]'s technical staff, working as an individual coach.\n\n==Club career==\nBorn in [[Graz]], [[Styria]], Wallner began his career with hometown [[SK Sturm Graz|Sturm Graz]] in 1998. In the following year he moved to [[SK Rapid Wien|Rapid Wien]], where he would have his most successful years, appearing in over 100 matches and scoring 42 goals over five seasons with the club. He then spent one year spells at German club [[Hannover 96]] and [[VfB Admira Wacker M\u00f6dling]] before signing with [[FK Austria Wien|Austria Vienna]] in 2005. He left the club in 2007.\n\nAt the beginning of the 2007\u201308 season, Wallner signed a one-year contract including the option of a 2nd year with Scottish Premier League outfit [[Falkirk F.C.]].<ref>[http://www.falkirkfc.co.uk/falkirk-news/austrian-hot-shot-signs-for-bairns.html Wallner signs for Falkirk] \u2013 Falkirk</ref>\n\nIn November 2007, Roman signed for [[Scottish First Division]] [[Hamilton Academical F.C.|Hamilton Academical]] on loan from Falkirk,<ref>[http://www.falkirkfc.co.uk/falkirk-news/wallner-departs-falkirk-2.html Wallner released] \u2013 Falkirk</ref> scoring once in four games against Stirling Albion.<ref>{{cite web  |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_div_1/7120217.stm |title=Stirling Albion 2\u20134 Hamilton Acc  |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=1 December 2007 |accessdate=28 March 2010}}</ref> He returned to Falkirk the following month.\n\nIn January 2008, he travelled to Greece where he was on trial for the Greek Cup 2006\u201307 winners [[Larissa F.C.]]. In the same month Falkirk announced that Wallner had been released from his contract by mutual consent. In late January, he signed with [[Apollon Kalamarias F.C.|Apollon Kalamarias]].\n\nOn 3 February 2008, Apollon Kalamarias' player Barkoglou scored a [[last minute goal]] in a match against [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]] which ended 1\u20130 to Apollon. Olympiakos appealed against Wallner's appearance in the match,<ref>[http://www.sportingreece.com/kb/article.asp?fIndex=1262 Olympiakos appeal] \u2013 Sportingreece</ref> because according to [[FIFA]] rules a player could play for no more than two teams per season (having already played for Falkirk and Hamilton Academical), because of this Apollon lost the game in cards 0\u20133 and had 1 point deducted. The case went to the jurisdiction of [[Court of Arbitration for Sport|CAS]]. The appeal for provisional measures was declined. After the end of the [[Greek Superleague]], Apollon Kalamarias was relegated and the deducted points would be inefficient to keep them clear of relegation. Therefore, the appeal against the first decision was withdrawn. Olympiacos won the title leading the table with runners-up [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK Athens]] trailing by only two points. This fact, along with the claims by the AEK chairman [[Demis Nikolaidis]] and footballers like [[Rivaldo]], [[Traianos Dellas]] and [[Nikos Lyberopoulos]] that the Greek Football Association was responsible for this outcome, left the AEK fans with a taste of unjustice. By then, Roman Wallner was one of the most identifiable and recnognisable footballers in Greece and the controversy about his case will be remembered by all the Greek football fans in the years to come.\n\n==International career==\nHe made his debut for [[Austria national football team|Austria]] in an April 2001 World Cup qualification match against [[Liechtenstein national football team|Liechtenstein]].\n\n==Coaching career==\nAfter retiring, Wallner was hired by [[Salzburger AK 1914]] as an individual coach both for the first team but also for the youth teams, mainly be responsible for the strikers.<ref>[https://www.sn.at/sport/regionalsport/sak-holt-ex-teamspieler-roman-wallner-71734417 SAK holt Ex-Teamspieler Roman Wallner], sn.at, 15 June 2019</ref> On 17 October

played as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]] and manager. He is currently a part of [[Salzburger AK 1914]]'s technical staff, working as an individual coach.\n\n==Club career==\nBorn in [[Graz]], [[Styria]], Wallner began his career with hometown [[SK Sturm Graz|Sturm Graz]] in 1998. In the following year he moved to [[SK Rapid Wien|Rapid Wien]], where he would have his most successful years, appearing in over 100 matches and scoring 42 goals over five seasons with the club. He then spent one year spells at German club [[Hannover 96]] and [[VfB Admira Wacker M\u00f6dling]] before signing with [[FK Austria Wien|Austria Vienna]] in 2005. He left the club in 2007.\n\nAt the beginning of the 2007\u201308 season, Wallner signed a one-year contract including the option of a 2nd year with Scottish Premier League outfit [[Falkirk F.C.]].<ref>[http://www.falkirkfc.co.uk/falkirk-news/austrian-hot-shot-signs-for-bairns.html Wallner signs for Falkirk] \u2013 Falkirk</ref>\n\nIn November 2007, Roman signed for [[Scottish First Division]] [[Hamilton Academical F.C.|Hamilton Academical]] on loan from Falkirk,<ref>[http://www.falkirkfc.co.uk/falkirk-news/wallner-departs-falkirk-2.html Wallner released] \u2013 Falkirk</ref> scoring once in four games against Stirling Albion.<ref>{{cite web  |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_div_1/7120217.stm |title=Stirling Albion 2\u20134 Hamilton Acc  |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=1 December 2007 |accessdate=28 March 2010}}</ref> He returned to Falkirk the following month.\n\nIn January 2008, he travelled to Greece where he was on trial for the Greek Cup 2006\u201307 winners [[Larissa F.C.]]. In the same month Falkirk announced that Wallner had been released from his contract by mutual consent. In late January, he signed with [[Apollon Kalamarias F.C.|Apollon Kalamarias]].\n\nOn 3 February 2008, Apollon Kalamarias' player Barkoglou scored a [[last minute goal]] in a match against [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]] which ended 1\u20130 to Apollon. Olympiakos appealed against Wallner's appearance in the match,<ref>[http://www.sportingreece.com/kb/article.asp?fIndex=1262 Olympiakos appeal] \u2013 Sportingreece</ref> because according to [[FIFA]] rules a player could play for no more than two teams per season (having already played for Falkirk and Hamilton Academical), because of this Apollon lost the game in cards 0\u20133 and had 1 point deducted. The case went to the jurisdiction of [[Court of Arbitration for Sport|CAS]]. The appeal for provisional measures was declined. After the end of the [[Greek Superleague]], Apollon Kalamarias was relegated and the deducted points would be inefficient to keep them clear of relegation. Therefore, the appeal against the first decision was withdrawn. Olympiacos won the title leading the table with runners-up [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK Athens]] trailing by only two points. This fact, along with the claims by the AEK chairman [[Demis Nikolaidis]] and footballers like [[Rivaldo]], [[Traianos Dellas]] and [[Nikos Lyberopoulos]] that the Greek Football Association was responsible for this outcome, left the AEK fans with a taste of unjustice. By then, Roman Wallner was one of the most identifiable and recnognisable footballers in Greece and the controversy about his case will be remembered by all the Greek football fans in the years to come.\n\n==International career==\nHe made his debut for [[Austria national football team|Austria]] in an April 2001 World Cup qualification match against [[Liechtenstein national football team|Liechtenstein]].\n\n==Coaching career==\nAfter retiring, Wallner was hired by [[Salzburger AK 1914]] as a individual coach both for the first team but also for the youth teams, mainly be responsible for the strikers.<ref>[https://www.sn.at/sport/regionalsport/sak-holt-ex-teamspieler-roman-wallner-71734417 SAK holt Ex-Teamspieler Roman Wallner], sn.at, 15 June 2019</ref> On 17 October 2019, Wallner was appointed caretaker manager for the last three games of the year, following the departure of Andreas F\u00f6tschl.<ref>[https://www.salzburg24.at/sport/fussball/unterhaus/sak-trainer-andreas-foetschl-gebuehrend-verabschiedet-77921986 F\u00f6tschl mit SAK-Torgala verabschiedet], salzburg24.at, 19 October 2019</ref>\n\n==Career statistics==\n\n===International===\n:Source:<ref>{{NFT player|id=469|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|colspan=\"3\"|[[Austria national football team|Austria national team]]\n|-\n!Year!!Apps!!Goals\n|-\n|2001||4||0\n|-\n|2002||8||3\n|-\n|2003||3||2\n|-\n|2004||4||0\n|-\n|2005||1||0\n|-\n|2006||3||0\n|-\n|2007||0||0\n|-\n|2008||0||0\n|-\n|2009||4||1\n|-\n|2010||2||1\n|-\n!Total||29||7\n|}\n\n==Honours==\n\n===Club===\n'''Austria Wien'''\n* [[Austrian Football Bundesliga]] (2): 2006\n* [[Austrian Cup]] (2): 2006, 2007 with [[Austria Wien]]\n\n'''Red Bull Salzburg'''\n* [[Austrian Football Bundesliga]]: 2010\n\n===Individual===\n* [[Austrian Footballer of the Year]]: 2001\n\n{{Commons category|Roman Wallner}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{official website|http://www.romanwallner.com}}\n* [http://redbulls.com/soccer/salzburg/en/team-player-detail_131.html Roman Wallner's profile at Red Bull Salzburg's official site] {{in lang|en}}\n* [http://www.apollonkalamariasfc.gr/en_pages/squad/players/wallner.htm Player profile] \u2013 Apollon Kalamarias\n* [http://www.austria-archiv.at/spieler.php?Spieler_ID=603 Player profile] \u2013 Austria Archive\n* [http://rapidarchiv.at/spieler/wallner_roman2.html Rapid stats] \u2013 Rapid Archiv\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wallner, Roman}}\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:1982 births]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from Graz]]\n[[Category:Association football forwards]]\n[[Category:Austrian footballers]]\n[[Category:Austrian football managers]]\n[[Category:Austria international footballers]]\n[[Category:SK Rapid Wien players]]\n[[Category:Hannover 96 players]]\n[[Category:FC Admira Wacker M\u00f6dling players]]\n[[Category:FK Austria Wien players]]\n[[Category:Falkirk F.C. players]]\n[[Category:Hamilton Academical F.C. players]]\n[[Category:Xanthi F.C. players]]\n[[Category:Apollon Pontou FC players]]\n[[Category:LASK Linz players]]\n[[Category:FC Red Bull Salzburg players]]\n[[Category:RB Leipzig players]]\n[[Category:FC Wacker Innsbruck players]]\n[[Category:SV Gr\u00f6dig players]]\n[[Category:Austrian Football Bundesliga players]]\n[[Category:Bundesliga players]]\n[[Category:Scottish Premier League players]]\n[[Category:Austrian expatriate footballers]]\n[[Category:Austrian expatriate sportspeople in Germany]]\n[[Category:Austrian expatriate sportspeople in Scotland]]\n[[Category:Austrian expatriate sportspeople in Greece]]\n[[Category:Expatriate footballers in Germany]]\n[[Category:Expatriate footballers in Scotland]]\n[[Category:Expatriate footballers in Greece]]\n", "name_user": "Arjayay", "label": "safe", "comment": "a > an", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Wallner"}

{"title_page": "Class (computer programming)", "text_new": "{{Original research|date=June 2015}}\n\nIn [[object-oriented programming]], a '''class''' is an extensible program-code-template for creating [[Object (object-oriented programming)|object]]s, providing initial values for state ([[member variable]]s) and implementations of behavior (member functions or [[Method (computer programming)|methods]]).{{sfn|Gamma|Helm|Johnson|Vlissides|1995| p=14}}{{sfn|Bruce|2002|loc=2.1 Objects, classes, and object types, {{Google books|9NGWq3K1RwUC|Objects, classes, and object types|page=18|plainurl=yes}}}} In many languages, the class name is used as the name for the class (the template itself), the name for the default [[Constructor (object-oriented programming)|constructor]] of the class (a [[subroutine]] that creates objects), and as the [[data type|type]] of objects generated by [[Instance (computer science)|instantiating]] the class; these distinct concepts are easily conflated.{{sfn|Bruce|2002|loc=2.1 Objects, classes, and object types, {{Google books|9NGWq3K1RwUC|Objects, classes, and object types|page=18|plainurl=yes}}}}\n\nWhen an object is created by a constructor of the class, the resulting object is called an [[Instance (computer science)|instance]] of the class, and the member variables specific to the object are called [[instance variable]]s, to contrast with the [[class variable]]s shared across the class.\n\nIn some languages, classes are only a compile-time feature (new classes cannot be declared at run-time), while in other languages classes are [[first-class citizen]]s, and are generally themselves objects (typically of type {{Mono|Class}} or similar). In these languages, a class that creates classes is called a [[metaclass]].\n\n== Class vs. type ==\nIn casual use, people often refer to the \"class\" of an object, but narrowly speaking objects have ''type'': the interface, namely the types of member variables, the signatures of [[member function]]s (methods), and properties these satisfy. At the same time, a class has an implementation (specifically the implementation of the methods), and can create objects of a given type, with a given implementation.{{sfn|Gamma|Helm|Johnson|Vlissides|1995| p=17}} In the terms of type theory, a class is an implementation{{mdashb}}a ''concrete'' [[data structure]] and collection of subroutines{{mdashb}}while a type is an [[Protocol (object-oriented programming)|interface]]. Different (concrete) classes can produce objects of the same (abstract) type (depending on type system); for example, the type {{Mono|Stack}} might be implemented with two classes{{snd}} {{Mono|SmallStack}} (fast for small stacks, but scales poorly) and {{Mono|ScalableStack}} (scales well but high overhead for small stacks). Similarly, a given class may have several different constructors.\n\nClass types generally represent nouns, such as a person, place or thing, or something [[Nominalization|nominalized]], and a class represents an implementation of these. For example, a {{Mono|Banana}} type might represent the properties and functionality of [[banana]]s in general, while the {{Mono|ABCBanana}} and {{Mono|XYZBanana}} classes would represent ways of producing bananas (say, banana suppliers or data structures and functions to represent and draw bananas in a video game). The {{Mono|ABCBanana}} class could then produce particular bananas: instances of the {{Mono|ABCBanana}} class would be objects of type {{Mono|Banana}}. Often only a single implementation of a type is given, in which case the class name is often identical with the type name.\n\n== Design and implementation ==\nClasses are composed from structural and behavioral constituents.{{sfn|Gamma et al.|1995| p=14}} <!-- though there may not be a requirement to include any constituents at all--> Programming languages that include classes as a programming construct offer support, for various class-related features, and the syntax required to use these features varies greatly from one programming language to another.\n\n=== {{Anchor|PROPERTY}}Structure ===\n[[File:oop-uml-class-example.png|frame|right|[[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] notation for classes]]\n\nA class contains [[Data (computing)|data]] field descriptions (or ''[[property (programming)|properties]]'', ''[[field (computer science)|fields]]'', ''data [[member variable|members]]'', or ''[[attribute (computing)|attributes]]''). These are usually field types and names that will be associated with state variables at program run time; these state variables either belong to the class or specific instances of the class. In most languages, the structure defined by the class determines the layout of the memory used by its instances. Other implementations are possible: for example, objects in [[Python (programming language)|Python]] use associative key-value containers.<ref name=\"pythondata model\">{{cite web|url=https://docs.python.org/reference/datamodel.html|title=3. Data model|work=The Python Language Reference|publisher=Python Software Foundation|accessdate=2012-04-26}}</ref>\n\nSome programming languages such as Eiffel support specification of [[class invariant|invariant]]s as part of the definition of the class, and enforce them through the type system. [[Encapsulation (object-oriented programming)|Encapsulation]] of state is necessary for being able to enforce the invariants of the class.\n\n=== Behavior ===\n{{Main|Method (computer programming)}}\n<!-- This section used to contain info on Java interfaces. If you wish to view it (to, say, move to another page), the last revision before the removal of this info is http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Class_(computer_science)&oldid=165562113 -->\n\nThe behavior of class or its instances is defined using [[Method (computer programming)|methods]]. Methods are [[subroutine]]s with the ability to operate on objects or classes. These operations may alter the state of an object or simply provide ways of accessing it.{{sfn|Booch|1994| p=86-88}} <!-- (Note: Some languages allow direct access to instance variables ([[C++]])). --> Many kinds of methods exist, but support for them varies across languages. Some types of methods are created and called by programmer code, while other special methods\u2014such as constructors, destructors, and conversion operators\u2014are created and called by compiler-generated code. A language may also allow the programmer to define and call these special methods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/classes/|title=Classes (I)|work=C++ Language Tutorial|publisher=cplusplus.com|accessdate=2012-04-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/classes2/|title=Classes (II)|work=C++ Language Tutorial|publisher=cplusplus.com|accessdate=2012-04-29}}</ref>\n\n=== The concept of class interface ===\n{{Main|Interface (computing)}}\n\nEvery class ''implements'' (or ''realizes'') an interface by providing [[#Structure|structure]] and behavior. Structure consists of data and state, and behavior consists of code that specifies how methods are implemented.{{sfn|Booch|1994|p=105}} There is a distinction between the definition of an interface and the implementation of that interface; however, this line is blurred in many programming languages because class declarations both define and implement an interface. Some languages, however, provide features that separate interface and implementation. For example, an [[#Abstract_and_Concrete|abstract class]] can define an interface without providing implementation.\n\nLanguages that support class inheritance also allow classes to inherit interfaces from the classes that they are derived from.\n\nFor example, if \"class A\" inherits from \"class B\" and if \"class B\" implements the interface \"interface B\" then \"class A\" also inherits the functionality(constants and methods declaration) provided by \"interface B\".\n\nIn languages that support [[#Information hiding and encapsulation|access specifiers]], the interface of a class is considered to be the set of public members of the class, including both methods and attributes (via implicit [[Mutator method|getter and setter methods]]); any private members or internal data structures are not intended to be depended on by external <!--client--> code and thus are not part of the interface.\n\nObject-oriented programming methodology <!--is designed in such a way--> dictates that the operations of any interface of a class are to be independent of each other. It results in a layered design where clients of an interface use the methods declared in the interface. An interface places no requirements for clients to invoke the operations of one interface in any particular order. This approach has the benefit that client code can assume that the operations of an interface are available for use whenever the client <!--holds a valid reference--> has access to the object.<ref>{{Cite book|title=New perspectives computer concepts, 2016. Comprehensive|last=Jamrich|first=Parsons, June|isbn=9781305271616|location=Boston, MA|oclc=917155105|date = 2015-06-22}}</ref> {{Citation needed|reason=Source needed for whole paragraph...this is a rather specific statement about OOP methodology.|date=April 2012}}\n\n==== Example ====\nThe buttons on the front of your television set are the interface between you and the electrical wiring on the other side of its plastic casing. You press the \"power\" button to toggle the television on and off. In this example, your particular television is the instance, each method is represented by a button, and all the buttons together compose the interface (other television sets that are the same model as yours would have the same interface). In its most common form, an interface is a specification of a group of related methods without any associated implementation of the methods.\n\nA television set also has a myriad of ''attributes'', such as size and whether it supports colour, which together comprise its structure. A class represents the full description of a television, including its attributes (structure) and buttons (interface).\n\nGetting the total number of televisions manufactured could be a ''static method'' of the television class. This method is clearly associated with the class, yet is outside the domain of each individual instance of the class. A static method that finds a particular instance out of the set of all television objects is another example.\n\n=== Member accessibility ===\n{{redirect|Private member|other uses|Private members club|and|Private member's bill}}\n{{Further|Information hiding}}\n\nThe following is a common set of [[access specifiers]]:<ref name=\"JavaAccessControl\">{{cite web| url=http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/accesscontrol.html|title=Controlling Access to Members of a Class|work=The Java Tutorials|publisher=Oracle|accessdate=2012-04-19}}</ref>\n\n* ''Private'' (or ''class-private'') restricts the access to the class itself. Only methods that are part of the same class can access private members.\n* ''Protected'' (or ''class-protected'') allows the class itself and all its subclasses to access the member.\n* ''Public'' means that any code can access the member by its name.\n\nAlthough many object-oriented languages support the above access specifiers, <!-- {{Citation needed|reason=This is fairly obvious, but it needs to be cited--could even use a few links even to articles within Wikipedia.|date=April 2012}} -->their semantics may differ.\n\nObject-oriented design uses the access specifiers in conjunction with careful design of public method implementations to enforce class invariants\u2014constraints on the state of the objects. A common usage of access specifiers is to separate the internal data of a class from its interface: the internal structure is made private, while public [[accessor method]]s can be used to inspect or alter such private data.\n\nAccess specifiers do not necessarily control ''visibility'', in that even private members may be visible to client external code. In some languages, an inaccessible but visible member may be referred to at run-time (for example, by a pointer returned from a member function), but an attempt to use it by referring to the name of the member from client code will be prevented by the type checker.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/cplusplus/OOP08-CPP.+Do+not+return+references+to+private+data|title=OOP08-CPP.

For example, the [[Java (programming language)|Java]] language does not allow client code that accesses the private data of a class to compile.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/11cheatsheet/errors.pdf|title=2.2 Identifiers|work=Compile and Runtime Errors in Java|first=Mordechai|last=Ben-Ari|date=2007-01-24|accessdate=2012-05-07}}</ref> <!-- whereas in languages like [[Objective-C]] or [[Perl]] client code is not restricted.--> In the [[C++]] language, private methods are visible, but not accessible in the interface; however, they may be made invisible by explicitly declaring fully abstract classes that represent the interfaces of the class.<ref name=\"cppinterface\">{{cite web|url=http://www.drdobbs.com/cpp/184410630|title=C++ Interfaces|last=Wild|first=Fred|work=Dr. Dobb's|publisher=UBM Techweb|accessdate=2012-05-02}}</ref>\n\nSome languages feature other accessibility schemes:\n* ''Instance vs. class accessibility'': [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] supports ''instance-private'' and ''instance-protected'' access specifiers in lieu of class-private and class-protected, respectively. They differ in that they restrict access based on the instance itself, rather than the instance's class.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/html/tut_classes.html | title=Classes, Objects, and Variables|work=Programming Ruby: The Pragmatic Programmer's Guide | last=Thomas | last2=Hunt | publisher=Ruby-Doc.org | accessdate=2012-04-26}}\n</ref>\n* ''Friend'': C++ supports a mechanism where a function explicitly declared as a [[friend function]] of the class may access the members designated as private or protected.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/inheritance/\n|title=Friendship and inheritance|work=C++ Language Tutorial|publisher=cplusplus.com|accessdate=2012-04-26}}</ref>\n* ''Path-based'': Java supports restricting access to a member within a [[Java syntax#Access modifiers|Java package]], which is the logical path of the file. However, it is a common practice when extending a Java framework to implement classes in the same package as a framework class in order to access protected members. The source file may exist in a completely different location, and may be deployed to a different .jar file, yet still be in the same logical path as far as the JVM is concerned.<ref name=JavaAccessControl />\n\n== Inter-class relationships ==\nIn addition to the design of standalone classes, programming languages may support more advanced class design based upon relationships between classes. The inter-class relationship design capabilities commonly provided are ''compositional'' and ''hierarchical''.\n\n=== Compositional ===\nClasses can be composed of other classes, thereby establishing a compositional relationship between the enclosing class and its embedded classes. Compositional relationship between classes is also commonly known as a ''[[has-a]]'' relationship.{{sfn|Booch|1994| p=180}} For example, a class \"Car\" could be composed of and contain a class \"Engine\". Therefore, a Car ''has an'' Engine. One aspect of composition is containment, which is the enclosure of component instances by the instance that has them. If an enclosing object contains component instances by value, the components and their enclosing object have a similar [[Object lifetime|lifetime]]. If the components are contained by reference, they may not have a similar lifetime.{{sfn|Booch|1994| p=128-129}} For example, in Objective-C 2.0:\n\n<source lang=\"objc\">\n@interface Car : NSObject\n\n@property NSString *name;\n@property Engine *engine\n@property NSArray *tires;\n\n@end\n</source>\n\nThis {{Mono|Car}} class ''has'' an instance of {{Mono|NSString}} (a [[string (computer science)|string]] object), {{Mono|Engine}}, and {{Mono|NSArray}} (an array object).\n\n=== Hierarchical ===\nClasses can be ''derived'' from one or more existing classes, thereby establishing a hierarchical relationship between the derived-from classes (''base classes'', ''parent classes'' or ''{{vanchor|superclasses|SUPERCLASS}}'') and the derived class (''child class'' or ''subclass'') . The relationship of the derived class to the derived-from classes is commonly known as an '''[[is-a]]''' relationship.{{sfn|Booch|1994| p=112}} For example, a class 'Button' could be derived from a class 'Control'. Therefore, a Button '''is a''' Control. Structural and behavioral members of the parent classes are ''inherited'' by the child class. Derived classes can define additional structural members (data fields) and behavioral members (methods) in addition to those that they ''inherit'' and are therefore ''specializations'' of their superclasses. Also, derived classes can [[method overriding|override]] inherited methods if the language allows.\n\nNot all languages support multiple inheritance. For example, Java allows a class to implement multiple interfaces, but only inherit from one class.<ref name=\"javainterface\">{{cite web| url=http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/createinterface.html|title=Interfaces|work=The Java Tutorials|publisher=Oracle|accessdate=2012-05-01}}</ref> If multiple inheritance is allowed, the hierarchy is a [[directed acyclic graph]] (or DAG for short), otherwise it is a [[tree (graph theory)|tree]]. The hierarchy has classes as nodes and inheritance relationships as links. Classes in the same level are more likely to be [[association (object-oriented programming)|associated]] than classes in different levels. The levels of this hierarchy are called [[Layer (object-oriented design)|layers]] or [[level of abstraction|levels of abstraction]].\n\nExample (Simplified Objective-C 2.0 code, from iPhone SDK):\n<source lang=\"objc\">\n@interface UIResponder : NSObject //...\n@interface UIView : UIResponder //...\n@interface UIScrollView : UIView //...\n@interface UITableView : UIScrollView //...\n</source>\nIn this example, a UITableView '''is a''' UIScrollView '''is a''' UIView '''is a''' UIResponder '''is an''' NSObject.\n\n==== Definitions of subclass ====\n{{Main|Inheritance (object-oriented programming)|Superclass (computer science)|Subclass (computer science)}}\nConceptually, a superclass is a [[superset]] of its subclasses. For example, a common class hierarchy would involve {{Mono|GraphicObject}} as a superclass of {{Mono|Rectangle}} and {{Mono|Ellipse}}, while {{Mono|Square}} would be a subclass of {{Mono|Rectangle}}. These are all [[Subset|subset relations]] in set theory as well, i.e., all squares are rectangles but not all rectangles are squares.\n\nA common conceptual error is to mistake a ''part of'' relation with a subclass. For example, a car and truck are both kinds of vehicles and it would be appropriate to model them as subclasses of a vehicle class. However, it would be an error to model the component parts of the car as subclass relations. For example, a car is composed of an engine and body, but it would not be appropriate to model engine or body as a subclass of car.\n\nIn object-oriented modeling these kinds of relations are typically modeled as object properties. In this example, the {{Mono|Car}} class would have a property called {{Mono|parts}}. {{Mono|parts}} would be typed to hold a collection of objects, such as instances of {{Mono|Body}}, {{Mono|Engine}}, {{Mono|Tires}}, etc.\nObject modeling languages such as [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] include capabilities to model various aspects of \"part of\" and other kinds of relations \u2013 data such as the cardinality of the objects, constraints on input and output values, etc. This information can be utilized by developer tools to generate additional code beside the basic data definitions for the objects, such as error checking on [[Mutator method|get and set methods]].<ref>{{cite web|title=UML-to-Java transformation in IBM Rational Software Architect editions and related software|url=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/08/1202_berfeld/|publisher=[[IBM]]|date=2 December 2008|first=Marya|last=Berfeld|accessdate=20 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nOne important question when modeling and implementing a system of object classes is whether a class can have one or more superclasses. In the real world with actual sets it would be rare to find sets that didn't intersect with more than one other set. However, while some systems such as Flavors and CLOS provide a capability for more than one parent to do so at run time introduces complexity that many in the object-oriented community consider antithetical to the goals of using object classes in the first place. Understanding which class will be responsible for handling a message can get complex when dealing with more than one superclass. If used carelessly this feature can introduce some of the same system complexity and ambiguity classes were designed to avoid.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jacobsen|first=Ivar|title=Object Oriented Software Engineering|year=1992|publisher=Addison-Wesley ACM Press|isbn=0-201-54435-0|pages=[https://archive.org/details/objectorientedso00jaco/page/43 43\u201369]|author2=Magnus Christerson|author3=Patrik Jonsson|author4=Gunnar Overgaard|url=https://archive.org/details/objectorientedso00jaco/page/43}}</ref>\n\nMost modern object-oriented languages such as Smalltalk and Java require single inheritance at run time. For these languages, multiple inheritance may be useful for modeling but not for an implementation.\n\nHowever, [[semantic web]] application objects do have multiple superclasses. The volatility of the Internet requires this level of flexibility and the technology standards such as the [[Web Ontology Language|Web Ontology Language (OWL)]] are designed to support it.\n\nA similar issue is whether or not the class hierarchy can be modified at run time. Languages such as Flavors, CLOS, and Smalltalk all support this feature as part of their [[meta-object protocol]]s. Since classes are themselves first-class objects, it is possible to have them dynamically alter their structure by sending them the appropriate messages. Other languages that focus more on strong typing such as Java and C++ do not allow the class hierarchy to be modified at run time. Semantic web objects have the capability for run time changes to classes. The rational is similar to the justification for allowing multiple superclasses, that the Internet is so dynamic and flexible that dynamic changes to the hierarchy are required to manage this volatility.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/BestPractices/SE/ODSD/|title=A Semantic Web Primer for Object-Oriented Software Developers|last1=Knublauch|first1=Holger|last2=Oberle|first2=Daniel|last3=Tetlow|first3=Phil|last4=Wallace|first4=Evan|publisher=[[W3C]]|date=2006-03-09|accessdate=2008-07-30}}</ref>\n\n=== Orthogonality of the class concept and inheritance ===\nAlthough class-based languages are commonly assumed to support inheritance, inheritance is not an intrinsic aspect of the concept of classes. Some languages, often referred to as \"[[object-based languages]]\", support classes yet do not support inheritance. Examples of object-based languages include earlier versions of [[Visual Basic]].<!-- do not provide the structural benefits of statically type-checked interfaces for objects. This is because in object-based languages, it is possible to use and extend data structures and attach methods to them at run-time. This precludes the compiler or interpreter being able to check the type information specified in the source code as the type is built dynamically and not defined statically. Most of these languages allow for ''instance behavior'' and complex ''operational polymorphism'' (see [[dynamic dispatch]] and [[Polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]]). -->\n\n=== Within object-oriented analysis <!-- belongs in an Object-Oriented Analysis article--> ===\n{{Main|Association (object-oriented programming)}}<!--consider moving a bunch of stuff here to this page...-->\n\nIn [[object-oriented analysis and design|object-oriented analysis]] and in [[Unified Modelling Language|UML]], an '''association''' between two classes represents a collaboration between the classes or their corresponding instances. Associations have direction; for example, a bi-directional association between two classes indicates that both of the classes are aware of their relationship.<ref name=\"ibmuml\">{{cite web| url=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/content/RationalEdge/sep04/bell/|title=UML Basics: The class diagram|last=Bell|first=Donald|work=developer Works|publisher=IBM|accessdate=2012-05-02}}</ref> Associations may be labeled according to their name or purpose.{{sfn|Booch|1994| p=179}}\n\nAn association role is given end of an association and describes the role of the corresponding class. For example, a \"subscriber\" role describes the way instances of the class \"Person\" participate in a \"subscribes-to\" association with the class \"Magazine\". Also, a \"Magazine\" has the \"subscribed magazine\" role in the same association. Association role multiplicity describes how many instances correspond to each instance of the other class of the association. Common multiplicities are \"0..1\", \"1..1\", \"1..*\" and \"0..*\", where the \"*\" specifies any number of instances.<ref name=ibmuml />\n\n== Taxonomy of classes ==\nThere are many categories of classes, some of which overlap.\n\n=== {{Anchor|Abstract_and_concrete_classes|Abstract_and_Concrete}}Abstract and concrete ===\n{{Main|Abstract type}}\n\nIn a language that supports inheritance, an '''abstract class''', or ''abstract base class'' (ABC), is a class that cannot be instantiated because it is either labeled as abstract or it simply specifies [[abstract method]]s (or ''virtual methods''). An abstract class may provide implementations of some methods, and may also specify virtual methods via [[Type signature|signatures]] that are to be implemented by direct or indirect descendants of the abstract class. Before a class derived from an abstract class can be instantiated, all abstract methods of its parent classes must be implemented by some class in the derivation chain.<ref name=\"cpppoly\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/polymorphism/\n|title=Polymorphism|work=C++ Language Tutorial|publisher=cplusplus.com|accessdate=2012-05-02}}</ref>\n\nMost object-oriented programming languages allow the programmer to specify which classes are considered abstract and will not allow these to be instantiated. For example, in [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] and [[PHP]], the keyword ''abstract'' is used.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/abstract.html|title=Abstract Methods and Classes|work=The Java Tutorials|publisher=Oracle|accessdate=2012-05-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.abstract.php|title=Class Abstraction|work=PHP Manual|publisher=The PHP Group|accessdate=2012-05-02}}</ref> In [[C++]], an abstract class is a class having at least one abstract method given by the appropriate syntax in that language (a pure virtual function in C++ parlance).<ref name=cpppoly />\n\nA class consisting of only virtual methods is called a Pure Abstract Base Class (or ''Pure ABC'') in C++ and is also known as an ''interface'' by users of the language.<ref name=cppinterface /> Other languages, notably Java and C#, support a variant of abstract classes called an [[Interface (Java)|interface]] via a keyword in the language. In these languages, [[multiple inheritance]] is not allowed, but a class can implement multiple interfaces. Such a class can only contain abstract publicly accessible methods.<ref name=javainterface /><ref>{{cite web | url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms173156.aspx | title=Interfaces (C# Programming Guide) | work=C# Programming Guide | publisher=Microsoft | accessdate=2013-08-15}}\n</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms173149.aspx | title=Inheritance (C# Programming Guide) | work=C# Programming Guide | publisher=Microsoft | accessdate=2012-05-02}}\n</ref>\n<!--Abstract classes defined as interfaces are a much more specific usage of the more general meaning of the term ''interface'', even as used in computer science, and the concept of interfaces has seen much usage and popularity within the realm of languages that support object-orientation.-->\n\nA '''concrete class''' is a class that can be [[Instantiation (computer science)|instantiated]], as opposed to abstract classes, which cannot. <!-- (In \"Advanced C++ Programming Styles and Idioms\", James Coplien defines \"concrete class\" as a class that has implicitly generated or explicitly defined special member functions that enable a class object to behave as do built-in types. These \"concrete classes\", then, adhere to the \"Orthodox Canonical Form\". Many developers who first learned the term as such, way back then, still primarily use it that way). -->\n\n=== Local and inner ===\nIn some languages, classes can be declared in [[Scope (programming)|scopes]] other than the global scope. There are various types of such classes.\n\nAn '''[[inner class]]''' is a class defined within another class. The relationship between an inner class and its containing class can also be treated as another type of class association. An inner class is typically neither associated with instances of the enclosing class nor instantiated along with its enclosing class. Depending on language, it may or may not be possible to refer to the class from outside the enclosing class. A related concept is ''inner types'', also known as ''inner data type'' or ''nested type'', which is a generalization of the concept of inner classes. [[C++]] is an example of a language that supports both inner classes and inner types (via ''[[typedef]]'' declarations).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/comphelp/v8v101/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.xlcpp8a.doc%2Flanguage%2Fref%2Fcplr061.htm | title=Nested classes (C++ only) | work=XL C/C++ V8.0 for AIX | publisher=IBM | accessdate=2012-05-07\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/comphelp/v8v101/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.xlcpp8a.doc%2Flanguage%2Fref%2Fcplr063.htm | title=Local type names (C++ only) | work=XL C/C++ V8.0 for AIX | publisher=IBM | accessdate=2012-05-07\n}}\n</ref>\n\nAnother type is a '''local class''', which is a class defined within a procedure or function. This limits references to the class name to within the scope where the class is declared. Depending on the semantic rules of the language, there may be additional restrictions on local classes compared to non-local ones. One common restriction is to disallow local class methods to access local variables of the enclosing function. For example, in C++, a local class may refer to static variables declared within its enclosing function, but may not access the function's automatic variables.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/comphelp/v8v101/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.xlcpp8a.doc%2Flanguage%2Fref%2Fcplr062.htm | title=Local classes (C++ only) | work=XL C/C++ V8.0 for AIX | publisher=IBM | accessdate=2012-05-07\n}}\n</ref>\n\n=== Metaclasses ===\n{{Main|Metaclass}}\n\nMetaclasses are classes whose instances are classes.{{sfn|Booch|1994|p=133-134}} A metaclass describes a common structure of a collection of classes and can implement a [[design pattern (computer science)|design pattern]] or describe particular kinds of classes.

Mixins are typically used to add the same methods to multiple classes; for example, a class {{Mono|UnicodeConversionMixin}} might provide a method called {{Mono|unicode_to_ascii}} when included in classes {{Mono|FileReader}} and {{Mono|WebPageScraper}} that do not share a common parent.\n\n=== Partial ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2012}}\n\nIn languages supporting the feature, a '''partial class''' is a class whose definition may be split into multiple pieces, within a single [[source code|source-code]] file or across multiple files.<ref name=\"mspartial\">{{Citation|url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/partial-classes-and-methods|title=Partial Classes and Methods|work=C# Programming Guide|date=2015-09-19|author1=mairaw|author2=BillWagner|author3=tompratt-AQ|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=2018-08-08}}</ref> The pieces are merged at compile-time, making compiler output the same as for a non-partial class.\n\nThe primary motivation for introduction of partial classes is to facilitate the implementation of [[code generator]]s, such as [[visual designer]]s.<ref name=\"mspartial\"/> It is otherwise a challenge or compromise to develop code generators that can manage the generated code when it is interleaved within developer-written code. Using partial classes, a code generator can process a separate file or coarse-grained partial class within a file, and is thus alleviated from intricately interjecting generated code via extensive parsing, increasing compiler efficiency and eliminating the potential risk of corrupting developer code. In a simple implementation of partial classes, the compiler can perform a phase of [[precompilation]] where it \"unifies\" all the parts of a partial class. Then, compilation can proceed as usual.\n\nOther benefits and effects of the partial class feature include:\n\n* Enables separation of a class's interface and implementation code in a unique way.\n* Eases navigation through large classes within an [[source code editor|editor]].\n* Enables [[separation of concerns]], in a way similar to [[aspect-oriented programming]] but without using any extra tools.\n* Enables multiple developers to work on a single class concurrently without the need to merge individual code into one file at a later time. <!-- (This enabling may be considered by some or most to be a detriment rather than a benefit for SoC can apply to programmers also).-->\n\nPartial classes have existed in [[Smalltalk]] under the name of ''Class Extensions'' for considerable time. With the arrival of the [[.NET Framework|.NET framework 2]], [[Microsoft]] introduced partial classes, supported in both [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] 2.0 and [[Visual Basic .NET|Visual Basic 2005]]. [[WinRT]] also supports partial classes.\n\n==== Example in VB.NET ====\nThis simple example, written in [[Visual Basic .NET]], shows how parts of the same class are defined in two different files.\n;file1.vb:\n<source lang=\"vbnet\">\nPartial Class MyClass\n    Private _name As String\nEnd Class\n</source>\n;file2.vb:\n<source lang=\"vbnet\">\nPartial Class MyClass\n    Public Readonly Property Name() As String\n         Get\n             Return _name\n         End Get\n    End Property\nEnd Class\n</source>\nWhen compiled, the result is the same as if the two files were written as one, like this:\n<source lang=\"vbnet\">\nClass MyClass\n    Private _name As String\n    Public Readonly Property Name() As String\n         Get\n             Return _name\n         End Get\n    End Property\nEnd Class\n</source>\n\n==== Example in Objective-C ====\nIn [[Objective-C]], partial classes, also known as '''categories''', may even spread over multiple libraries and executables, like the following example. But a key difference is that Objective-C's categories can overwrite definitions in another interface declaration, and that categories aren't equal to original class definition (the first requires the last).<ref name=\"appleCategories\">{{citation|url=https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/CustomizingExistingClasses/CustomizingExistingClasses.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011210-CH6-SW1|title=Customizing Existing Classes|work=Programming with Objective-C|date=2014-09-17|author=Apple|publisher=Apple|accessdate=2018-08-08}}</ref> Instead, .NET partial class can't have conflicting definitions, and all partial definitions are equal to the others.<ref name=\"mspartial\"/>\n\nIn Foundation, header file NSData.h:\n<source lang=\"objc\">\n@interface NSData : NSObject\n\n- (id)initWithContentsOfURL:(NSURL *)URL;\n//...\n\n@end\n</source>\nIn user-supplied library, a separate binary from Foundation framework, header file NSData+base64.h:\n<source lang=\"objc\">\n#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>\n\n@interface NSData (base64)\n\n- (NSString *)base64String;\n- (id)initWithBase64String:(NSString *)base64String;\n\n@end\n</source>\nAnd in an app, yet another separate binary file, source code file main.m:\n<source lang=\"objc\">\n#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>\n#import \"NSData+base64.h\"\n\nint main(int argc, char *argv[])\n{\n    if (argc < 2)\n        return EXIT_FAILURE;\n    NSString *sourceURLString = [NSString stringWithCString:argv[1]];\n    NSData *data = [[NSData alloc] initWithContentsOfURL:[NSURL URLWithString:sourceURLString]];\n    NSLog(@\"%@\", [data base64String]);\n    return EXIT_SUCCESS;\n}\n</source>\nThe dispatcher will find both methods called over the NSData instance and invoke both of them correctly.\n\n=== Uninstantiable ===\n'''Uninstantiable classes''' allow programmers to group together per-class fields and methods that are accessible at runtime without an instance of the class. Indeed, instantiation is prohibited for this kind of class.\n\nFor example, in C#, a class marked \"static\" can not be instantiated, can only have static members (fields, methods, other), may not have ''instance constructors'', and is ''sealed''.\n<ref>{{cite web | url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/79b3xss3(v=vs.100).aspx | title=Static Classes and Static Class Members (C# Programming Guide) | work=C# Programming Guide | publisher=Microsoft | accessdate=2012-05-08}}\n</ref>\n\n=== Unnamed ===\nAn '''unnamed class''' or '''anonymous class''' is a class that is not bound to a name or identifier upon definition.

System analysts can talk to both developers and users using essentially the same vocabulary, talking about accounts, customers, bills, etc. Object classes often facilitate rapid development because most object-oriented environments come with powerful debugging and testing tools. Instances of classes can be inspected at run time to verify that the system is performing as expected. Also, rather than get dumps of core memory, most object-oriented environments have interpreted debugging capabilities so that the developer can analyze exactly where in the program the error occurred and can see which methods were called to which arguments and with what arguments.<ref>{{cite book|last=Booch|first=Grady|title=Object-Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications|publisher=Addison-Wesley Professional|isbn=978-0-201-89551-3|pages=1\u201328|url=http://my.safaribooksonline.com/book/software-engineering-and-development/object/9780201895513|author2=Robert A.

When developers need to change the behavior of an object they can localize the change to just that object and its component parts. This reduces the potential for unwanted side effects from maintenance enhancements.\n\nSoftware re-use is also a major benefit of using Object classes. Classes facilitate re-use via inheritance and interfaces. When a new behavior is required it can often be achieved by creating a new class and having that class inherit the default behaviors and data of its superclass and then tailor some aspect of the behavior or data accordingly. Re-use via interfaces (also known as methods) occurs when another object wants to invoke (rather than create a new kind of) some object class. This method for re-use removes many of the common errors that can make their way into software when one program re-uses code from another.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jacobsen|first=Ivar|title=Object Oriented Software Engineering|year=1992|publisher=Addison-Wesley ACM Press|isbn=0-201-54435-0|author2=Magnus Christerson|author3=Patrik Jonsson|author4=Gunnar Overgaard|url=https://archive.org/details/objectorientedso00jaco}}</ref>\n\n== Run-time representation ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2012}}\n\nAs a data type, a class is usually considered as a compile-time construct <ref>{{cite web |title=C++ International standard |url=http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2017/n4713.pdf |website=Working Draft, Standard for Programming Language C++ |publisher=ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22 WG21 |accessdate=5 January 2020}}</ref>.

In these languages, a class that creates classes is called a [[metaclass]].\n\n== Class vs. type ==\nIn casual use, people often refer to the \"class\" of an object, but narrowly speaking objects have ''type'': the interface, namely the types of member variables, the signatures of [[member function]]s (methods), and properties these satisfy. At the same time, a class has an implementation (specifically the implementation of the methods), and can create objects of a given type, with a given implementation.{{sfn|Gamma|Helm|Johnson|Vlissides|1995| p=17}} In the terms of type theory, a class is an implementation{{mdashb}}a ''concrete'' [[data structure]] and collection of subroutines{{mdashb}}while a type is an [[Protocol (object-oriented programming)|interface]]. Different (concrete) classes can produce objects of the same (abstract) type (depending on type system); for example, the type {{Mono|Stack}} might be implemented with two classes{{snd}} {{Mono|SmallStack}} (fast for small stacks, but scales poorly) and {{Mono|ScalableStack}} (scales well but high overhead for small stacks). Similarly, a given class may have several different constructors.\n\nClass types generally represent nouns, such as a person, place or thing, or something [[Nominalization|nominalized]], and a class represents an implementation of these. For example, a {{Mono|Banana}} type might represent the properties and functionality of [[banana]]s in general, while the {{Mono|ABCBanana}} and {{Mono|XYZBanana}} classes would represent ways of producing bananas (say, banana suppliers or data structures and functions to represent and draw bananas in a video game). The {{Mono|ABCBanana}} class could then produce particular bananas: instances of the {{Mono|ABCBanana}} class would be objects of type {{Mono|Banana}}. Often only a single implementation of a type is given, in which case the class name is often identical with the type name.\n\n== Design and implementation ==\nClasses are composed from structural and behavioral constituents.{{sfn|Gamma et al.|1995| p=14}} <!-- though there may not be a requirement to include any constituents at all--> Programming languages that include classes as a programming construct offer support, for various class-related features, and the syntax required to use these features varies greatly from one programming language to another.\n\n=== {{Anchor|PROPERTY}}Structure ===\n[[File:oop-uml-class-example.png|frame|right|[[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] notation for classes]]\n\nA class contains [[Data (computing)|data]] field descriptions (or ''[[property (programming)|properties]]'', ''[[field (computer science)|fields]]'', ''data [[member variable|members]]'', or ''[[attribute (computing)|attributes]]''). These are usually field types and names that will be associated with state variables at program run time; these state variables either belong to the class or specific instances of the class. In most languages, the structure defined by the class determines the layout of the memory used by its instances. Other implementations are possible: for example, objects in [[Python (programming language)|Python]] use associative key-value containers.<ref name=\"pythondata model\">{{cite web|url=https://docs.python.org/reference/datamodel.html|title=3. Data model|work=The Python Language Reference|publisher=Python Software Foundation|accessdate=2012-04-26}}</ref>\n\nSome programming languages support specification of [[class invariant|invariant]]s as part of the definition of the class, and enforce them through the type system. [[Encapsulation (object-oriented programming)|Encapsulation]] of state is necessary for being able to enforce the invariants of the class.\n\n=== Behavior ===\n{{Main|Method (computer programming)}}\n<!-- This section used to contain info on Java interfaces.

Methods are [[subroutine]]s with the ability to operate on objects or classes. These operations may alter the state of an object or simply provide ways of accessing it.{{sfn|Booch|1994| p=86-88}} <!-- (Note: Some languages allow direct access to instance variables ([[C++]])). --> Many kinds of methods exist, but support for them varies across languages. Some types of methods are created and called by programmer code, while other special methods\u2014such as constructors, destructors, and conversion operators\u2014are created and called by compiler-generated code. A language may also allow the programmer to define and call these special methods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/classes/|title=Classes (I)|work=C++ Language Tutorial|publisher=cplusplus.com|accessdate=2012-04-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/classes2/|title=Classes (II)|work=C++ Language Tutorial|publisher=cplusplus.com|accessdate=2012-04-29}}</ref>\n\n=== The concept of class interface ===\n{{Main|Interface (computing)}}\n\nEvery class ''implements'' (or ''realizes'') an interface by providing [[#Structure|structure]] and behavior. Structure consists of data and state, and behavior consists of code that specifies how methods are implemented.{{sfn|Booch|1994|p=105}} There is a distinction between the definition of an interface and the implementation of that interface; however, this line is blurred in many programming languages because class declarations both define and implement an interface. Some languages, however, provide features that separate interface and implementation. For example, an [[#Abstract_and_Concrete|abstract class]] can define an interface without providing implementation.\n\nLanguages that support class inheritance also allow classes to inherit interfaces from the classes that they are derived from.\n\nFor example, if \"class A\" inherits from \"class B\" and if \"class B\" implements the interface \"interface B\" then \"class A\" also inherits the functionality(constants and methods declaration) provided by \"interface B\".\n\nIn languages that support [[#Information hiding and encapsulation|access specifiers]], the interface of a class is considered to be the set of public members of the class, including both methods and attributes (via implicit [[Mutator method|getter and setter methods]]); any private members or internal data structures are not intended to be depended on by external <!--client--> code and thus are not part of the interface.\n\nObject-oriented programming methodology <!--is designed in such a way--> dictates that the operations of any interface of a class are to be independent of each other. It results in a layered design where clients of an interface use the methods declared in the interface. An interface places no requirements for clients to invoke the operations of one interface in any particular order. This approach has the benefit that client code can assume that the operations of an interface are available for use whenever the client <!--holds a valid reference--> has access to the object.<ref>{{Cite book|title=New perspectives computer concepts, 2016.

You press the \"power\" button to toggle the television on and off. In this example, your particular television is the instance, each method is represented by a button, and all the buttons together compose the interface (other television sets that are the same model as yours would have the same interface). In its most common form, an interface is a specification of a group of related methods without any associated implementation of the methods.\n\nA television set also has a myriad of ''attributes'', such as size and whether it supports colour, which together comprise its structure. A class represents the full description of a television, including its attributes (structure) and buttons (interface).\n\nGetting the total number of televisions manufactured could be a ''static method'' of the television class. This method is clearly associated with the class, yet is outside the domain of each individual instance of the class. A static method that finds a particular instance out of the set of all television objects is another example.\n\n=== Member accessibility ===\n{{redirect|Private member|other uses|Private members club|and|Private member's bill}}\n{{Further|Information hiding}}\n\nThe following is a common set of [[access specifiers]]:<ref name=\"JavaAccessControl\">{{cite web| url=http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/accesscontrol.html|title=Controlling Access to Members of a Class|work=The Java Tutorials|publisher=Oracle|accessdate=2012-04-19}}</ref>\n\n* ''Private'' (or ''class-private'') restricts the access to the class itself. Only methods that are part of the same class can access private members.\n* ''Protected'' (or ''class-protected'') allows the class itself and all its subclasses to access the member.\n* ''Public'' means that any code can access the member by its name.\n\nAlthough many object-oriented languages support the above access specifiers, <!-- {{Citation needed|reason=This is fairly obvious, but it needs to be cited--could even use a few links even to articles within Wikipedia.|date=April 2012}} -->their semantics may differ.\n\nObject-oriented design uses the access specifiers in conjunction with careful design of public method implementations to enforce class invariants\u2014constraints on the state of the objects. A common usage of access specifiers is to separate the internal data of a class from its interface: the internal structure is made private, while public [[accessor method]]s can be used to inspect or alter such private data.\n\nAccess specifiers do not necessarily control ''visibility'', in that even private members may be visible to client external code. In some languages, an inaccessible but visible member may be referred to at run-time (for example, by a pointer returned from a member function), but an attempt to use it by referring to the name of the member from client code will be prevented by the type checker.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/cplusplus/OOP08-CPP.+Do+not+return+references+to+private+data|title=OOP08-CPP.

However, it is a common practice when extending a Java framework to implement classes in the same package as a framework class in order to access protected members. The source file may exist in a completely different location, and may be deployed to a different .jar file, yet still be in the same logical path as far as the JVM is concerned.<ref name=JavaAccessControl />\n\n== Inter-class relationships ==\nIn addition to the design of standalone classes, programming languages may support more advanced class design based upon relationships between classes. The inter-class relationship design capabilities commonly provided are ''compositional'' and ''hierarchical''.\n\n=== Compositional ===\nClasses can be composed of other classes, thereby establishing a compositional relationship between the enclosing class and its embedded classes. Compositional relationship between classes is also commonly known as a ''[[has-a]]'' relationship.{{sfn|Booch|1994| p=180}} For example, a class \"Car\" could be composed of and contain a class \"Engine\". Therefore, a Car ''has an'' Engine. One aspect of composition is containment, which is the enclosure of component instances by the instance that has them. If an enclosing object contains component instances by value, the components and their enclosing object have a similar [[Object lifetime|lifetime]]. If the components are contained by reference, they may not have a similar lifetime.{{sfn|Booch|1994| p=128-129}} For example, in Objective-C 2.0:\n\n<source lang=\"objc\">\n@interface Car : NSObject\n\n@property NSString *name;\n@property Engine *engine\n@property NSArray *tires;\n\n@end\n</source>\n\nThis {{Mono|Car}} class ''has'' an instance of {{Mono|NSString}} (a [[string (computer science)|string]] object), {{Mono|Engine}}, and {{Mono|NSArray}} (an array object).\n\n=== Hierarchical ===\nClasses can be ''derived'' from one or more existing classes, thereby establishing a hierarchical relationship between the derived-from classes (''base classes'', ''parent classes'' or ''{{vanchor|superclasses|SUPERCLASS}}'') and the derived class (''child class'' or ''subclass'') . The relationship of the derived class to the derived-from classes is commonly known as an '''[[is-a]]''' relationship.{{sfn|Booch|1994| p=112}} For example, a class 'Button' could be derived from a class 'Control'. Therefore, a Button '''is a''' Control. Structural and behavioral members of the parent classes are ''inherited'' by the child class. Derived classes can define additional structural members (data fields) and behavioral members (methods) in addition to those that they ''inherit'' and are therefore ''specializations'' of their superclasses. Also, derived classes can [[method overriding|override]] inherited methods if the language allows.\n\nNot all languages support multiple inheritance. For example, Java allows a class to implement multiple interfaces, but only inherit from one class.<ref name=\"javainterface\">{{cite web| url=http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/createinterface.html|title=Interfaces|work=The Java Tutorials|publisher=Oracle|accessdate=2012-05-01}}</ref> If multiple inheritance is allowed, the hierarchy is a [[directed acyclic graph]] (or DAG for short), otherwise it is a [[tree (graph theory)|tree]]. The hierarchy has classes as nodes and inheritance relationships as links. Classes in the same level are more likely to be [[association (object-oriented programming)|associated]] than classes in different levels. The levels of this hierarchy are called [[Layer (object-oriented design)|layers]] or [[level of abstraction|levels of abstraction]].\n\nExample (Simplified Objective-C 2.0 code, from iPhone SDK):\n<source lang=\"objc\">\n@interface UIResponder : NSObject //...\n@interface UIView : UIResponder //...\n@interface UIScrollView : UIView //...\n@interface UITableView : UIScrollView //...\n</source>\nIn this example, a UITableView '''is a''' UIScrollView '''is a''' UIView '''is a''' UIResponder '''is an''' NSObject.\n\n==== Definitions of subclass ====\n{{Main|Inheritance (object-oriented programming)|Superclass (computer science)|Subclass (computer science)}}\nConceptually, a superclass is a [[superset]] of its subclasses. For example, a common class hierarchy would involve {{Mono|GraphicObject}} as a superclass of {{Mono|Rectangle}} and {{Mono|Ellipse}}, while {{Mono|Square}} would be a subclass of {{Mono|Rectangle}}. These are all [[Subset|subset relations]] in set theory as well, i.e., all squares are rectangles but not all rectangles are squares.\n\nA common conceptual error is to mistake a ''part of'' relation with a subclass. For example, a car and truck are both kinds of vehicles and it would be appropriate to model them as subclasses of a vehicle class. However, it would be an error to model the component parts of the car as subclass relations. For example, a car is composed of an engine and body, but it would not be appropriate to model engine or body as a subclass of car.\n\nIn object-oriented modeling these kinds of relations are typically modeled as object properties. In this example, the {{Mono|Car}} class would have a property called {{Mono|parts}}. {{Mono|parts}} would be typed to hold a collection of objects, such as instances of {{Mono|Body}}, {{Mono|Engine}}, {{Mono|Tires}}, etc.\nObject modeling languages such as [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] include capabilities to model various aspects of \"part of\" and other kinds of relations \u2013 data such as the cardinality of the objects, constraints on input and output values, etc. This information can be utilized by developer tools to generate additional code beside the basic data definitions for the objects, such as error checking on [[Mutator method|get and set methods]].<ref>{{cite web|title=UML-to-Java transformation in IBM Rational Software Architect editions and related software|url=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/08/1202_berfeld/|publisher=[[IBM]]|date=2 December 2008|first=Marya|last=Berfeld|accessdate=20 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nOne important question when modeling and implementing a system of object classes is whether a class can have one or more superclasses. In the real world with actual sets it would be rare to find sets that didn't intersect with more than one other set. However, while some systems such as Flavors and CLOS provide a capability for more than one parent to do so at run time introduces complexity that many in the object-oriented community consider antithetical to the goals of using object classes in the first place. Understanding which class will be responsible for handling a message can get complex when dealing with more than one superclass.

For these languages, multiple inheritance may be useful for modeling but not for an implementation.\n\nHowever, [[semantic web]] application objects do have multiple superclasses. The volatility of the Internet requires this level of flexibility and the technology standards such as the [[Web Ontology Language|Web Ontology Language (OWL)]] are designed to support it.\n\nA similar issue is whether or not the class hierarchy can be modified at run time. Languages such as Flavors, CLOS, and Smalltalk all support this feature as part of their [[meta-object protocol]]s. Since classes are themselves first-class objects, it is possible to have them dynamically alter their structure by sending them the appropriate messages. Other languages that focus more on strong typing such as Java and C++ do not allow the class hierarchy to be modified at run time. Semantic web objects have the capability for run time changes to classes. The rational is similar to the justification for allowing multiple superclasses, that the Internet is so dynamic and flexible that dynamic changes to the hierarchy are required to manage this volatility.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/BestPractices/SE/ODSD/|title=A Semantic Web Primer for Object-Oriented Software Developers|last1=Knublauch|first1=Holger|last2=Oberle|first2=Daniel|last3=Tetlow|first3=Phil|last4=Wallace|first4=Evan|publisher=[[W3C]]|date=2006-03-09|accessdate=2008-07-30}}</ref>\n\n=== Orthogonality of the class concept and inheritance ===\nAlthough class-based languages are commonly assumed to support inheritance, inheritance is not an intrinsic aspect of the concept of classes. Some languages, often referred to as \"[[object-based languages]]\", support classes yet do not support inheritance. Examples of object-based languages include earlier versions of [[Visual Basic]].<!-- do not provide the structural benefits of statically type-checked interfaces for objects. This is because in object-based languages, it is possible to use and extend data structures and attach methods to them at run-time. This precludes the compiler or interpreter being able to check the type information specified in the source code as the type is built dynamically and not defined statically. Most of these languages allow for ''instance behavior'' and complex ''operational polymorphism'' (see [[dynamic dispatch]] and [[Polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]]). -->\n\n=== Within object-oriented analysis <!-- belongs in an Object-Oriented Analysis article--> ===\n{{Main|Association (object-oriented programming)}}<!--consider moving a bunch of stuff here to this page...-->\n\nIn [[object-oriented analysis and design|object-oriented analysis]] and in [[Unified Modelling Language|UML]], an '''association''' between two classes represents a collaboration between the classes or their corresponding instances. Associations have direction; for example, a bi-directional association between two classes indicates that both of the classes are aware of their relationship.<ref name=\"ibmuml\">{{cite web| url=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/content/RationalEdge/sep04/bell/|title=UML Basics: The class diagram|last=Bell|first=Donald|work=developer Works|publisher=IBM|accessdate=2012-05-02}}</ref> Associations may be labeled according to their name or purpose.{{sfn|Booch|1994| p=179}}\n\nAn association role is given end of an association and describes the role of the corresponding class. For example, a \"subscriber\" role describes the way instances of the class \"Person\" participate in a \"subscribes-to\" association with the class \"Magazine\". Also, a \"Magazine\" has the \"subscribed magazine\" role in the same association. Association role multiplicity describes how many instances correspond to each instance of the other class of the association. Common multiplicities are \"0..1\", \"1..1\", \"1..*\" and \"0..*\", where the \"*\" specifies any number of instances.<ref name=ibmuml />\n\n== Taxonomy of classes ==\nThere are many categories of classes, some of which overlap.\n\n=== {{Anchor|Abstract_and_concrete_classes|Abstract_and_Concrete}}Abstract and concrete ===\n{{Main|Abstract type}}\n\nIn a language that supports inheritance, an '''abstract class''', or ''abstract base class'' (ABC), is a class that cannot be instantiated because it is either labeled as abstract or it simply specifies [[abstract method]]s (or ''virtual methods''). An abstract class may provide implementations of some methods, and may also specify virtual methods via [[Type signature|signatures]] that are to be implemented by direct or indirect descendants of the abstract class. Before a class derived from an abstract class can be instantiated, all abstract methods of its parent classes must be implemented by some class in the derivation chain.<ref name=\"cpppoly\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/polymorphism/\n|title=Polymorphism|work=C++ Language Tutorial|publisher=cplusplus.com|accessdate=2012-05-02}}</ref>\n\nMost object-oriented programming languages allow the programmer to specify which classes are considered abstract and will not allow these to be instantiated.

In these languages, [[multiple inheritance]] is not allowed, but a class can implement multiple interfaces.

These \"concrete classes\", then, adhere to the \"Orthodox Canonical Form\". Many developers who first learned the term as such, way back then, still primarily use it that way). -->\n\n=== Local and inner ===\nIn some languages, classes can be declared in [[Scope (programming)|scopes]] other than the global scope. There are various types of such classes.\n\nAn '''[[inner class]]''' is a class defined within another class. The relationship between an inner class and its containing class can also be treated as another type of class association. An inner class is typically neither associated with instances of the enclosing class nor instantiated along with its enclosing class. Depending on language, it may or may not be possible to refer to the class from outside the enclosing class. A related concept is ''inner types'', also known as ''inner data type'' or ''nested type'', which is a generalization of the concept of inner classes. [[C++]] is an example of a language that supports both inner classes and inner types (via ''[[typedef]]'' declarations).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/comphelp/v8v101/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.xlcpp8a.doc%2Flanguage%2Fref%2Fcplr061.htm | title=Nested classes (C++ only) | work=XL C/C++ V8.0 for AIX | publisher=IBM | accessdate=2012-05-07\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/comphelp/v8v101/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.xlcpp8a.doc%2Flanguage%2Fref%2Fcplr063.htm | title=Local type names (C++ only) | work=XL C/C++ V8.0 for AIX | publisher=IBM | accessdate=2012-05-07\n}}\n</ref>\n\nAnother type is a '''local class''', which is a class defined within a procedure or function. This limits references to the class name to within the scope where the class is declared. Depending on the semantic rules of the language, there may be additional restrictions on local classes compared to non-local ones. One common restriction is to disallow local class methods to access local variables of the enclosing function. For example, in C++, a local class may refer to static variables declared within its enclosing function, but may not access the function's automatic variables.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/comphelp/v8v101/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.xlcpp8a.doc%2Flanguage%2Fref%2Fcplr062.htm | title=Local classes (C++ only) | work=XL C/C++ V8.0 for AIX | publisher=IBM | accessdate=2012-05-07\n}}\n</ref>\n\n=== Metaclasses ===\n{{Main|Metaclass}}\n\nMetaclasses are classes whose instances are classes.{{sfn|Booch|1994|p=133-134}} A metaclass describes a common structure of a collection of classes and can implement a [[design pattern (computer science)|design pattern]] or describe particular kinds of classes.

Mixins are typically used to add the same methods to multiple classes; for example, a class {{Mono|UnicodeConversionMixin}} might provide a method called {{Mono|unicode_to_ascii}} when included in classes {{Mono|FileReader}} and {{Mono|WebPageScraper}} that do not share a common parent.\n\n=== Partial ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2012}}\n\nIn languages supporting the feature, a '''partial class''' is a class whose definition may be split into multiple pieces, within a single [[source code|source-code]] file or across multiple files.<ref name=\"mspartial\">{{Citation|url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/partial-classes-and-methods|title=Partial Classes and Methods|work=C# Programming Guide|date=2015-09-19|author1=mairaw|author2=BillWagner|author3=tompratt-AQ|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=2018-08-08}}</ref> The pieces are merged at compile-time, making compiler output the same as for a non-partial class.\n\nThe primary motivation for introduction of partial classes is to facilitate the implementation of [[code generator]]s, such as [[visual designer]]s.<ref name=\"mspartial\"/> It is otherwise a challenge or compromise to develop code generators that can manage the generated code when it is interleaved within developer-written code. Using partial classes, a code generator can process a separate file or coarse-grained partial class within a file, and is thus alleviated from intricately interjecting generated code via extensive parsing, increasing compiler efficiency and eliminating the potential risk of corrupting developer code. In a simple implementation of partial classes, the compiler can perform a phase of [[precompilation]] where it \"unifies\" all the parts of a partial class. Then, compilation can proceed as usual.\n\nOther benefits and effects of the partial class feature include:\n\n* Enables separation of a class's interface and implementation code in a unique way.\n* Eases navigation through large classes within an [[source code editor|editor]].\n* Enables [[separation of concerns]], in a way similar to [[aspect-oriented programming]] but without using any extra tools.\n* Enables multiple developers to work on a single class concurrently without the need to merge individual code into one file at a later time. <!-- (This enabling may be considered by some or most to be a detriment rather than a benefit for SoC can apply to programmers also).-->\n\nPartial classes have existed in [[Smalltalk]] under the name of ''Class Extensions'' for considerable time. With the arrival of the [[.NET Framework|.NET framework 2]], [[Microsoft]] introduced partial classes, supported in both [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] 2.0 and [[Visual Basic .NET|Visual Basic 2005]]. [[WinRT]] also supports partial classes.\n\n==== Example in VB.NET ====\nThis simple example, written in [[Visual Basic .NET]], shows how parts of the same class are defined in two different files.\n;file1.vb:\n<source lang=\"vbnet\">\nPartial Class MyClass\n    Private _name As String\nEnd Class\n</source>\n;file2.vb:\n<source lang=\"vbnet\">\nPartial Class MyClass\n    Public Readonly Property Name() As String\n         Get\n             Return _name\n         End Get\n    End Property\nEnd Class\n</source>\nWhen compiled, the result is the same as if the two files were written as one, like this:\n<source lang=\"vbnet\">\nClass MyClass\n    Private _name As String\n    Public Readonly Property Name() As String\n         Get\n             Return _name\n         End Get\n    End Property\nEnd Class\n</source>\n\n==== Example in Objective-C ====\nIn [[Objective-C]], partial classes, also known as '''categories''', may even spread over multiple libraries and executables, like the following example. But a key difference is that Objective-C's categories can overwrite definitions in another interface declaration, and that categories aren't equal to original class definition (the first requires the last).<ref name=\"appleCategories\">{{citation|url=https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/CustomizingExistingClasses/CustomizingExistingClasses.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011210-CH6-SW1|title=Customizing Existing Classes|work=Programming with Objective-C|date=2014-09-17|author=Apple|publisher=Apple|accessdate=2018-08-08}}</ref> Instead, .NET partial class can't have conflicting definitions, and all partial definitions are equal to the others.<ref name=\"mspartial\"/>\n\nIn Foundation, header file NSData.h:\n<source lang=\"objc\">\n@interface NSData : NSObject\n\n- (id)initWithContentsOfURL:(NSURL *)URL;\n//...\n\n@end\n</source>\nIn user-supplied library, a separate binary from Foundation framework, header file NSData+base64.h:\n<source lang=\"objc\">\n#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>\n\n@interface NSData (base64)\n\n- (NSString *)base64String;\n- (id)initWithBase64String:(NSString *)base64String;\n\n@end\n</source>\nAnd in an app, yet another separate binary file, source code file main.m:\n<source lang=\"objc\">\n#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>\n#import \"NSData+base64.h\"\n\nint main(int argc, char *argv[])\n{\n    if (argc < 2)\n        return EXIT_FAILURE;\n    NSString *sourceURLString = [NSString stringWithCString:argv[1]];\n    NSData *data = [[NSData alloc] initWithContentsOfURL:[NSURL URLWithString:sourceURLString]];\n    NSLog(@\"%@\", [data base64String]);\n    return EXIT_SUCCESS;\n}\n</source>\nThe dispatcher will find both methods called over the NSData instance and invoke both of them correctly.\n\n=== Uninstantiable ===\n'''Uninstantiable classes''' allow programmers to group together per-class fields and methods that are accessible at runtime without an instance of the class. Indeed, instantiation is prohibited for this kind of class.\n\nFor example, in C#, a class marked \"static\" can not be instantiated, can only have static members (fields, methods, other), may not have ''instance constructors'', and is ''sealed''.\n<ref>{{cite web | url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/79b3xss3(v=vs.100).aspx | title=Static Classes and Static Class Members (C# Programming Guide) | work=C# Programming Guide | publisher=Microsoft | accessdate=2012-05-08}}\n</ref>\n\n=== Unnamed ===\nAn '''unnamed class''' or '''anonymous class''' is a class that is not bound to a name or identifier upon definition.

System analysts can talk to both developers and users using essentially the same vocabulary, talking about accounts, customers, bills, etc. Object classes often facilitate rapid development because most object-oriented environments come with powerful debugging and testing tools. Instances of classes can be inspected at run time to verify that the system is performing as expected. Also, rather than get dumps of core memory, most object-oriented environments have interpreted debugging capabilities so that the developer can analyze exactly where in the program the error occurred and can see which methods were called to which arguments and with what arguments.<ref>{{cite book|last=Booch|first=Grady|title=Object-Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications|publisher=Addison-Wesley Professional|isbn=978-0-201-89551-3|pages=1\u201328|url=http://my.safaribooksonline.com/book/software-engineering-and-development/object/9780201895513|author2=Robert A.

When developers need to change the behavior of an object they can localize the change to just that object and its component parts. This reduces the potential for unwanted side effects from maintenance enhancements.\n\nSoftware re-use is also a major benefit of using Object classes. Classes facilitate re-use via inheritance and interfaces. When a new behavior is required it can often be achieved by creating a new class and having that class inherit the default behaviors and data of its superclass and then tailor some aspect of the behavior or data accordingly. Re-use via interfaces (also known as methods) occurs when another object wants to invoke (rather than create a new kind of) some object class. This method for re-use removes many of the common errors that can make their way into software when one program re-uses code from another.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jacobsen|first=Ivar|title=Object Oriented Software Engineering|year=1992|publisher=Addison-Wesley ACM Press|isbn=0-201-54435-0|author2=Magnus Christerson|author3=Patrik Jonsson|author4=Gunnar Overgaard|url=https://archive.org/details/objectorientedso00jaco}}</ref>\n\n== Run-time representation ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2012}}\n\nAs a data type, a class is usually considered as a compile-time construct <ref>{{cite web |title=C++ International standard |url=http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2017/n4713.pdf |website=Working Draft, Standard for Programming Language C++ |publisher=ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22 WG21 |accessdate=5 January 2020}}</ref>.

Many languages distinguish this kind of [[run-time type information]] about classes from a class on the basis that the information is not needed at run-time. Some dynamic languages do not make strict distinctions between run-time and compile-time constructs, and therefore may not distinguish between metaobjects and classes.\n\nFor example, if Human is a [[metaobject]] representing the class Person, then instances of class Person can be created by using the facilities of the Human [[metaobject]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Computer programming}}\n\n* [[Class-based programming]]\n* [[Class diagram]] (UML)\n* [[List of object-oriented programming languages]]\n* [[Mixin]]\n* [[Object-oriented programming]]\n* [[Prototype-based programming]]\n* [[Trait (computer programming)]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book | ref = harv | last = Booch | first = Grady | year = 1994 | title = Objects and Design with Applications, Second Edition | publisher = Benjamin/Cummings\n}}\n* {{cite book | ref = harv | last = Gamma | last2 = Helm | last3 = Johnson | last4 = Vlissides | year = 1995 | title = Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software | url = https://archive.org/details/designpatternsel00gamm | url-access = registration | publisher = Addison Wesley\n}}\n* {{cite book | isbn = 978-0-262-02523-2 | title = Foundations of Object-Oriented Languages: Types and Semantics | last = Bruce | first = Kim B. | year = 2002 | publisher = MIT Press | location = Cambridge, MA | url = http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/foundations-object-oriented-languages}}\n{{refend}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* [http://lucacardelli.name/TheoryOfObjects.html Abadi; Cardelli: A Theory of Objects]\n* [http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/ ISO/IEC 14882:2003 Programming Language C++, International standard]\n* [http://www.laputan.org/reflection/warfare.html Class Warfare: Classes vs. Prototypes], by Brian Foote\n* Meyer, B.: \"Object-oriented software construction\", 2nd edition, Prentice Hall, 1997, {{ISBN|0-13-629155-4}}\n* Rumbaugh et al.: \"Object-oriented modeling and design\", Prentice Hall, 1991, {{ISBN|0-13-630054-5}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{cite web| title=Programming demo - .NET using Partial Types for better code | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaw8K8GNhAI | work=Hyper/Net | publisher=Youtube|date=October 2006| last=Dias| first=Tiago}}\n\n{{Programming language}}\n{{Data types}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Class (Computer Programming)}}\n[[Category:Class (computer programming)| ]]\n[[Category:Programming constructs]]\n[[Category:Programming language topics]]\n", "name_user": "Esap", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200e{{Anchor|PROPERTY}}Structure", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_programming)"}

Along with caprylic acid (C8) these total 15% in goat milk fat.\n\n==Uses==\nCaprylic acid is used commercially in the production of [[ester]]s used in perfumery and also in the manufacture of dyes.\n\nCaprylic acid is an antimicrobial pesticide used as a food contact surface sanitizer in commercial food handling establishments on dairy equipment, food processing equipment, breweries, wineries, and beverage processing plants.  It is also used as disinfectant in health care facilities, schools/colleges, animal care/veterinary facilities, industrial facilities, office buildings, recreational facilities, retail and wholesale establishments, livestock premises, restaurants, and hotels/motels.  In addition, caprylic acid is used as an algicide, bactericide, fungicide, and herbicide in nurseries, greenhouses, garden centers, and interiors, and on ornamentation. Products containing caprylic acid are formulated as soluble concentrate/liquids and ready-to-use liquids.<ref>EPA - Antimicrobials Division.

The sensation of hunger is a signal that the body requires an input of energy in the form of food consumption. Ghrelin stimulates hunger by triggering [[Growth hormone secretagogue receptor|receptors]] in the [[hypothalamus]]. In order to activate these receptors, ghrelin must undergo a process called [[acylation]] in which it acquires an -[[Hydroxy group|OH group]], and caprylic acid provides this by linking at a specific site on ghrelin molecules. Other [[Fatty acid|fatty acids]] in the same position have similar effects on hunger.\n\nCaprylic acid is currently being researched as a treatment for [[essential tremor]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Voller|first=Bernhard|last2=Lines|first2=Emily|last3=McCrossin|first3=Gayle|last4=Tinaz|first4=Sule|last5=Lungu|first5=Codrin|last6=Grimes|first6=George|last7=Starling|first7=Judith|last8=Potti|first8=Gopal|last9=Buchwald|first9=Peter|date=2016-02-29|title=Dose-escalation study of octanoic acid in patients with essential tremor|journal=Journal of Clinical Investigation|language=en|volume=126|issue=4|pages=1451\u20131457|doi=10.1172/JCI83621|pmid=26927672|issn=0021-9738|pmc=4811161}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lowell|first=Soren Y.|last2=Kelley|first2=Richard T.|last3=Monahan|first3=Marika|last4=Hosbach-Cannon|first4=Carly Jo|last5=Colton|first5=Raymond H.|last6=Mihaila|first6=Dragos|date=2018-12-25|title=The Effect of Octanoic Acid on Essential Voice Tremor: A Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study: Effect of Octanoic Acid on EVT|journal=The Laryngoscope|volume=129|issue=8|pages=1882\u20131890|language=en|doi=10.1002/lary.27695|pmid=30585335|pmc=6592780}}</ref>\n\nThe [[acid chloride]] of caprylic acid is used in the synthesis of [[perfluorooctanoic acid]].\n\n===Dietary uses===\n{{see also|Medium-chain triglyceride#Dietary relevance}}\n\nCaprylic acid is taken as a [[dietary supplement]].

The sensation of hunger is a signal that the body requires an input of energy in the form of food consumption. Ghrelin stimulates hunger by triggering [[Growth hormone secretagogue receptor|receptors]] in the [[hypothalamus]]. In order to activate these receptors, ghrelin must undergo a process called [[acylation]] in which it acquires an -[[Hydroxy group|OH group]], and caprylic acid provides this by linking at a specific site on ghrelin molecules. Other [[Fatty acid|fatty acids]] in the same position have similar effects on hunger.\n\nCaprylic acid is currently being researched as a treatment for [[essential tremor]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Voller|first=Bernhard|last2=Lines|first2=Emily|last3=McCrossin|first3=Gayle|last4=Tinaz|first4=Sule|last5=Lungu|first5=Codrin|last6=Grimes|first6=George|last7=Starling|first7=Judith|last8=Potti|first8=Gopal|last9=Buchwald|first9=Peter|date=2016-02-29|title=Dose-escalation study of octanoic acid in patients with essential tremor|journal=Journal of Clinical Investigation|language=en|volume=126|issue=4|pages=1451\u20131457|doi=10.1172/JCI83621|pmid=26927672|issn=0021-9738|pmc=4811161}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lowell|first=Soren Y.|last2=Kelley|first2=Richard T.|last3=Monahan|first3=Marika|last4=Hosbach-Cannon|first4=Carly Jo|last5=Colton|first5=Raymond H.|last6=Mihaila|first6=Dragos|date=2018-12-25|title=The Effect of Octanoic Acid on Essential Voice Tremor: A Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study: Effect of Octanoic Acid on EVT|journal=The Laryngoscope|volume=129|issue=8|pages=1882\u20131890|language=en|doi=10.1002/lary.27695|pmid=30585335|pmc=6592780}}</ref>\n\nThe [[acid chloride]] of caprylic acid is used in the synthesis of [[perfluorooctanoic acid]].\n\n===Dietary uses===\n{{see also|Medium-chain triglyceride#Dietary relevance}}\n\nCaprylic acid is taken as a [[dietary supplement]].

Based in [[Dearborn, Michigan]], a suburb of [[Detroit]], the automaker was founded by [[Henry Ford]],  on June 16, 1903. Ford Motor Company would go on to become one of the largest and most profitable companies in the world, as well as being one of the few to survive the [[Great Depression]]. The largest family-controlled company in the world, the Ford Motor Company has been in continuous family control for over 110 years. Ford now encompasses two brands: Ford and [[Lincoln (automobile)|Lincoln]]. Ford once owned 5 other luxury brands: Volvo, Land Rover, Jaguar, Aston Martin and Mercury. Over time, those brands were sold to other companies and Mercury was discontinued.\n\n==Foundation==\n[[Henry Ford]] built his first automobile, which he called a [[Ford Quadricycle|quadricycle]], at his home in Detroit in 1896. The location has been redeveloped, where the [[Michigan Building]] now stands, and the tracks for the [[Detroit People Mover]] and the [[Times Square station (Detroit)|Times Square People Mover station]] are nearby. At the entrance to the Michigan Building, there is a commemorative plaque identifying the original location of the Ford home.

The company foundered, and in 1901 was reorganized as the [[Henry Ford Company]]. In March 1902, after falling out with his financial backers, Ford left the company with the rights to his name and 900 [[United States dollar|dollars]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nHenry Ford turned to an acquaintance, coal dealer [[Alexander Y. Malcomson]], to help finance another automobile company. Malcomson put up the money to start the partnership \"Ford and Malcomson\" and the pair designed a car and began ordering parts. However, by February 1903, Ford and Malcomson had gone through more money than expected, and the manufacturing firm of [[John Francis Dodge|John]] and [[Horace Elgin Dodge|Horace Dodge]], who had made parts for Ford and Malcomson, was demanding payment.<ref name = \"ind\">{{citation | title = Independent man: the life of Senator James Couzens| author = Harry Barnard | publisher = Wayne State University Press | year = 2002 | isbn= 1104834677}}</ref> Malcomson, constrained by his coal business demands, turned to his uncle [[John S. Gray (Michigan)|John S. Gray]], the president of the German-American Savings Bank and a good friend. Malcomson proposed incorporating Ford and Malcomson to bring in new investors, and wanted Gray to join the company, thinking that Gray's name would attract other investors. Gray was not interested at first, but Malcomson promised he could withdraw his share at any time, so Gray reluctantly agreed. On the strength of Gray's name, Malcomson recruited other business acquaintances to invest, including local merchants Albert Strelow and Vernon Fry, lawyers John Anderson and [[Horace Rackham]], Charles T. Bennett of the [[Daisy Outdoor Products|Daisy Air Rifle Company]], and his own clerk [[James Couzens]].<ref name = \"ind\"/> Malcomson also convinced the Dodges to accept stock in lieu of payment.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nOn June 16, 1903, the Ford Motor Company was incorporated, with 12 investors owning a total of 1000 shares. Ford and Malcomson together retained 51% of the new company in exchange for their earlier investments. When the total stock ownership was tabulated, shares in the company were: [[Henry Ford]] (255 shares), [[Alexander Y. Malcomson]] (255 shares), [[John S. Gray (Michigan)|John S. Gray]] (105 shares), John W. Anderson (50 shares), [[Horace Rackham]] (50 shares), [[Horace E. Dodge]] (50 shares), [[John F. Dodge]] (50 shares), Charles T. Bennett (50 shares), Vernon C.

A dividend of 10% was paid that October, an additional dividend of 20% at the beginning of 1904, and another 68% in June 1904. Two dividends of 100% each in June and July 1905 brought the total investor profits to nearly 300% in just over 2 years; 1905 total profits were almost $300,000.<ref name = \"ind\"/>\n\nHowever, there were internal frictions in the company that Gray was nominally in charge of. Most of the investors, both Malcomson and Gray included, had their own businesses to attend to; only Ford and Couzens worked full-time at the company. The issue came to a head when the principal stockholders, Ford and Malcomson, quarreled over the future direction of the company. Gray sided with Ford. By early 1906 Malcomson was effectively frozen out of the Ford Motor Company, and in May sold his shares to Henry Ford.<ref name = \"ind\"/> John S. Gray died unexpectedly in 1906, and his position as Ford's president was taken over by Ford himself soon afterward.<ref name = \"ind\"/>\n\nFord was subject to lawsuits or threats from the [[Association of Licensed Automobile Manufacturers]] early in its history. The Association claimed patent rights to most gasoline-powered automobiles. After several years of legal wrangling, the Association eventually dropped its case against Ford in 1911.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n==Early developments and assembly line==\n[[File:First Ford factory on Bagley St, Detroit.jpg|thumb|The coal shed on Bagley Street, Detroit where Henry Ford built his first car in 1896.]]\nDuring its early years, the company produced a range of vehicles designated, chronologically, from the [[Ford Model A (1903)]] to the Model K and Model S (Ford's last right-hand steering model)<ref>Clymer, Floyd.

Now, paint had become a production bottleneck; only [[Japan Black]] dried quickly enough, and not until [[Duco]] [[lacquer]] appeared in 1926 would other colors reappear on the T.<ref name=\"Georgano\"/>\n\nIn 1915, Henry Ford went on a peace mission to Europe aboard a ship, joining other pacifists in efforts to stop [[World War I]]. This led to an increase in his personal popularity.

The Dodge brothers, [[John Francis Dodge]] and [[Horace Elgin Dodge]], the largest non-family shareholders, with 10% of the company, objected and took Ford to court in 1917 in an often cited case, [[Dodge v. Ford Motor Company]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P9NPkoZWSpwC|title=The Dodge Brothers: The Men, the Motor Cars, and the Legacy|isbn=9780814332467|page=84|date=2005|last1=Hyde|first1=Charles K.}}</ref> The judge found in their favor requiring a $19million special dividend.

To encourage this, he threatened to leave and set up a rival company, offering to buy out the minority shareholders, at varying prices. He gained complete control in July 1919 at a cost of $125 million, made up of $106 million of the stock and $19 million in court-ordered dividend, financed with a $75 million loan from two eastern banks.

So, while [[List of automotive superlatives|four-wheel brakes]] were invented by [[Arrol-Johnson]] (and were used on the 1909 [[Argyll (automobile)|Argyll]]),<ref name=\"Georgano\"/> they did not appear on a Ford until 1927,<ref name=\"Georgano\"/> only a year before Chevrolet. Ford steadily lost market share to [[General Motors Corporation|GM]] and [[Chrysler Corporation|Chrysler]], as these and other domestic and foreign competitors began offering fresher automobiles with more innovative features and luxury options. GM had a range of models from relatively cheap to luxury, tapping all price points in the spectrum, while less wealthy people purchased used [[Ford Model T|Model T]]s. The competitors also opened up new markets by extending credit for purchases, so consumers could buy these expensive automobiles with monthly payments. Ford initially resisted this approach, insisting such debts would ultimately hurt the consumer and the general economy. Ford eventually relented and started offering the same terms in December 1927, when Ford unveiled the redesigned [[Ford Model A (1927\u20131931)|Model A]], and retired the [[Ford Model T|Model T]] after producing 15 million units.

Although Ford did assist a small number of distressed families with loans and parcels of land to work, the majority of the thousands of unskilled workers who were laid off were left to cope on their own. However, Henry Ford angered many by making public statements that the unemployed should do more to find work for themselves.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nThis led to Detroit's [[Unemployed Councils|Unemployed Council]] organizing the [[Ford Hunger March]]. On March 7, 1932 some 3,000 - 5,000 unemployed workers assembled in West Detroit to march on Ford's [[Ford River Rouge Complex|River Rouge]] plant to deliver a petition demanding more support. As the march moved up Miller Road and approached Gate 3 the protest turned ugly. The police fired [[tear gas]] into the crowd and fire trucks were used to soak the protesters with icy water. When the protesters responded by throwing rocks, the violence escalated rapidly and culminated in the police and plant security guards firing live rounds through the gates of the plant at the unarmed protesters. Four men were killed outright and a fifth died later in the hospital. Up to 60 more were seriously injured.<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Babson\n | first = Steve\n | authorlink = Steve Babson\n | title = Working Detroit: The Making of a Union Town\n | publisher = [[Wayne State University Press]]\n | year = 1986\n | page = 59\n | isbn = 0-8143-1819-3}}</ref>\n\n===Soviet Fords and the ''Gorki''===\nIn May 1929 the [[Soviet Union]] signed an agreement with the Ford Motor Company.

Many American engineers and skilled auto workers moved to the Soviet Union to work on the plant and its production lines, which was named ''Gorkovsky Avtomobilny Zavod'' ([[GAZ]]), or Gorki Automotive Plant in 1932.

Both these Ford models were immediately adopted for military use. By the late 1930s production at Gorki was 80,000-90,000 \"Russian Ford\" vehicles per year. With its original Ford-designed vehicles supplemented by imports and domestic copies of imported equipment, the Gorki operations eventually produced a range of automobiles, trucks, and military vehicles.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n===Era of neutrality===\nDuring the first 27 months of World War II, when the U.S. was neutral (to December 1941), Ford was hesitant to participate in the Allied military effort. Ford insisted that peaceful trade was the best way to avoid war. Ford had a [[Ford Germany|subsidiary in Germany]]. In 1936, a Ford executive visiting Germany was informed by a Nazi official that Ford's Cologne plant manager was a Jew (he had one grandparent who was Jewish), prompting discussions at Ford offices in both Germany and the U.S. Heinrich Albert, Ford's Germany-U.S. liaison, insisted that the manager be fired.

It is estimated that over 250 deaths and more than 3,000 serious injuries resulted from these failures. Although [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]] received most of the blame, some blame fell on Ford, which advised customers to under-inflate the tires in order to reduce the risk of vehicle rollovers.\n\n===Nazi collaboration===\n{{further|Henry Ford#The Dearborn Independent|l1=Henry Ford}}\n\nIn 1940, at a time when the German division had begun to use slave labor, Ford-Werke was still under the control of Dearborn.<ref name=\"Wallace, Max 2003\"/> After Pearl Harbor, Ford lost control of its division in Germany, and all the Ford facilities in Germany came under the full control of the Nazi government.

No result was proven and the company denied the allegations.\n\nIn a lawsuit initiated in 1996 by relatives of some of the estimated 600 Spanish citizens who disappeared in Argentina during the \"[[Dirty War]]\", evidence was presented to support the allegation that much of this repression was directed by Ford and the other major industrial firms. According to a 5,000-page report, Ford executives drew up lists of \"subversive\" workers and handed them over to the military task-forces which were allowed to operate within the factories.

Based in [[Dearborn, Michigan]], a suburb of [[Detroit]], the automaker was founded by [[Henry Ford]],  on June 16, 1903. Ford Motor Company would go on to become one of the largest and most profitable companies in the world, as well as being one of the few to survive the [[Great Depression]]. The largest family-controlled company in the world, the Ford Motor Company has been in continuous family control for over 110 years.

The company foundered, and in 1901 was reorganized as the [[Henry Ford Company]]. In March 1902, after falling out with his financial backers, Ford left the company with the rights to his name and 900 [[United States dollar|dollars]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nHenry Ford turned to an acquaintance, coal dealer [[Alexander Y. Malcomson]], to help finance another automobile company. Malcomson put up the money to start the partnership \"Ford and Malcomson\" and the pair designed a car and began ordering parts. However, by February 1903, Ford and Malcomson had gone through more money than expected, and the manufacturing firm of [[John Francis Dodge|John]] and [[Horace Elgin Dodge|Horace Dodge]], who had made parts for Ford and Malcomson, was demanding payment.<ref name = \"ind\">{{citation | title = Independent man: the life of Senator James Couzens| author = Harry Barnard | publisher = Wayne State University Press | year = 2002 | isbn= 1104834677}}</ref> Malcomson, constrained by his coal business demands, turned to his uncle [[John S. Gray (Michigan)|John S. Gray]], the president of the German-American Savings Bank and a good friend. Malcomson proposed incorporating Ford and Malcomson to bring in new investors, and wanted Gray to join the company, thinking that Gray's name would attract other investors. Gray was not interested at first, but Malcomson promised he could withdraw his share at any time, so Gray reluctantly agreed. On the strength of Gray's name, Malcomson recruited other business acquaintances to invest, including local merchants Albert Strelow and Vernon Fry, lawyers John Anderson and [[Horace Rackham]], Charles T. Bennett of the [[Daisy Outdoor Products|Daisy Air Rifle Company]], and his own clerk [[James Couzens]].<ref name = \"ind\"/> Malcomson also convinced the Dodges to accept stock in lieu of payment.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nOn June 16, 1903, the Ford Motor Company was incorporated, with 12 investors owning a total of 1000 shares. Ford and Malcomson together retained 51% of the new company in exchange for their earlier investments. When the total stock ownership was tabulated, shares in the company were: [[Henry Ford]] (255 shares), [[Alexander Y. Malcomson]] (255 shares), [[John S. Gray (Michigan)|John S.

A dividend of 10% was paid that October, an additional dividend of 20% at the beginning of 1904, and another 68% in June 1904. Two dividends of 100% each in June and July 1905 brought the total investor profits to nearly 300% in just over 2 years; 1905 total profits were almost $300,000.<ref name = \"ind\"/>\n\nHowever, there were internal frictions in the company that Gray was nominally in charge of. Most of the investors, both Malcomson and Gray included, had their own businesses to attend to; only Ford and Couzens worked full-time at the company. The issue came to a head when the principal stockholders, Ford and Malcomson, quarreled over the future direction of the company. Gray sided with Ford. By early 1906 Malcomson was effectively frozen out of the Ford Motor Company, and in May sold his shares to Henry Ford.<ref name = \"ind\"/> John S.

To encourage this, he threatened to leave and set up a rival company, offering to buy out the minority shareholders, at varying prices.

So, while [[List of automotive superlatives|four-wheel brakes]] were invented by [[Arrol-Johnson]] (and were used on the 1909 [[Argyll (automobile)|Argyll]]),<ref name=\"Georgano\"/> they did not appear on a Ford until 1927,<ref name=\"Georgano\"/> only a year before Chevrolet. Ford steadily lost market share to [[General Motors Corporation|GM]] and [[Chrysler Corporation|Chrysler]], as these and other domestic and foreign competitors began offering fresher automobiles with more innovative features and luxury options. GM had a range of models from relatively cheap to luxury, tapping all price points in the spectrum, while less wealthy people purchased used [[Ford Model T|Model T]]s. The competitors also opened up new markets by extending credit for purchases, so consumers could buy these expensive automobiles with monthly payments. Ford initially resisted this approach, insisting such debts would ultimately hurt the consumer and the general economy. Ford eventually relented and started offering the same terms in December 1927, when Ford unveiled the redesigned [[Ford Model A (1927\u20131931)|Model A]], and retired the [[Ford Model T|Model T]] after producing 15 million units. An early version of the Ford script in the oval badge was first used on the 1928 Model A; the Ford script had been created in 1903 by [[Childe Harold Wills]], and the oval trademark in 1907.<ref>Fall 2006 myFord magazine</ref>\n\n===Lincoln Motor Company===\nOn February 4, 1922 Ford expanded its reach into the luxury auto market through its acquisition of the [[Lincoln Motor Company]] from [[Henry M.

Although Ford did assist a small number of distressed families with loans and parcels of land to work, the majority of the thousands of unskilled workers who were laid off were left to cope on their own. However, Henry Ford angered many by making public statements that the unemployed should do more to find work for themselves.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nThis led to Detroit's [[Unemployed Councils|Unemployed Council]] organizing the [[Ford Hunger March]]. On March 7, 1932 some 3,000 - 5,000 unemployed workers assembled in West Detroit to march on Ford's [[Ford River Rouge Complex|River Rouge]] plant to deliver a petition demanding more support. As the march moved up Miller Road and approached Gate 3 the protest turned ugly. The police fired [[tear gas]] into the crowd and fire trucks were used to soak the protesters with icy water. When the protesters responded by throwing rocks, the violence escalated rapidly and culminated in the police and plant security guards firing live rounds through the gates of the plant at the unarmed protesters. Four men were killed outright and a fifth died later in the hospital. Up to 60 more were seriously injured.<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Babson\n | first = Steve\n | authorlink = Steve Babson\n | title = Working Detroit: The Making of a Union Town\n | publisher = [[Wayne State University Press]]\n | year = 1986\n | page = 59\n | isbn = 0-8143-1819-3}}</ref>\n\n===Soviet Fords and the ''Gorki''===\nIn May 1929 the [[Soviet Union]] signed an agreement with the Ford Motor Company.

Many American engineers and skilled auto workers moved to the Soviet Union to work on the plant and its production lines, which was named ''Gorkovsky Avtomobilny Zavod'' ([[GAZ]]), or Gorki Automotive Plant in 1932. A few American workers stayed on after the plant's completion, and eventually became victims of Stalin's [[Great Purge|Great Terror]], either shot<ref>Tzouliadis, Tim, ''The Forsaken: An American Tragedy in Stalin's Russia'', Penguin Press (2008), {{ISBN|1-59420-168-4}}, {{ISBN|978-1-59420-168-4}}: Many of the slain were dumped in the mass grave at [[Yuzhnoye Butovo District]] near Moscow.</ref> or exiled to Soviet [[gulag]]s.<ref>Tzouliadis, Tim, ''The Forsaken: An American Tragedy in Stalin's Russia'', Penguin Press (2008), {{ISBN|1-59420-168-4}}, {{ISBN|978-1-59420-168-4}}</ref> In 1933, the Soviets completed construction on a production line for the Ford Model-A passenger car, called the ''GAZ-A'', and a light truck, the ''GAZ-AA''. Both these Ford models were immediately adopted for military use. By the late 1930s production at Gorki was 80,000-90,000 \"Russian Ford\" vehicles per year. With its original Ford-designed vehicles supplemented by imports and domestic copies of imported equipment, the Gorki operations eventually produced a range of automobiles, trucks, and military vehicles.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n===Era of neutrality===\nDuring the first 27 months of World War II, when the U.S. was neutral (to December 1941), Ford was hesitant to participate in the Allied military effort. Ford insisted that peaceful trade was the best way to avoid war. Ford had a [[Ford Germany|subsidiary in Germany]]. In 1936, a Ford executive visiting Germany was informed by a Nazi official that Ford's Cologne plant manager was a Jew (he had one grandparent who was Jewish), prompting discussions at Ford offices in both Germany and the U.S. Heinrich Albert, Ford's Germany-U.S. liaison, insisted that the manager be fired. The manager was replaced by Robert Schmidt, who would play an important role in Germany's war effort.<ref name=\"Wallace, Max 2003\">Wallace, Max. (2003).

However, Ford's Dearborn headquarters continued to maintain a 52% ownership over its German factories but with no voice or control or financial reward. Ford factories contributed significantly to the buildup of Germany's armed forces.

Some have accused the early [[Fordism|Fordist]] model of production of being exploitative, and Ford has been criticized as being willing to collaborate with [[dictatorship]]s or hire mobs to intimidate union leaders and increase their profits through unethical means.\n\nFord refused to allow [[collective bargaining]] until 1941, with the Ford Service Department being set up as an internal security, intimidation, and espionage unit within the company, and quickly gained a reputation of using violence against union organizers and sympathizers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ford Motor Company Chronology |url=http://www.hfmgv.org/exhibits/fmc/battle.asp |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608031953/http://www.hfmgv.org/exhibits/fmc/battle.asp |archivedate=2011-06-08 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Detroit News: The Battle of the Overpass |url=http://info.detnews.com/history/story/index.cfm?id=172&category=events |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130102143837/http://info.detnews.com/history/story/index.cfm?id=172&category=events |archivedate=2013-01-02 }}</ref>\n\nFord was also criticized for tread separation and tire disintegration of many [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]] tires installed on [[Ford Explorer]]s, [[Mercury Mountaineer]]s, and [[Mazda Navajo]]s, which caused many crashes during the late 1990s and early 2000s (decade). It is estimated that over 250 deaths and more than 3,000 serious injuries resulted from these failures. Although [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]] received most of the blame, some blame fell on Ford, which advised customers to under-inflate the tires in order to reduce the risk of vehicle rollovers.\n\n===Nazi collaboration===\n{{further|Henry Ford#The Dearborn Independent|l1=Henry Ford}}\n\nIn 1940, at a time when the German division had begun to use slave labor, Ford-Werke was still under the control of Dearborn.<ref name=\"Wallace, Max 2003\"/> After Pearl Harbor, Ford lost control of its division in Germany, and all the Ford facilities in Germany came under the full control of the Nazi government.

No result was proven and the company denied the allegations.\n\nIn a lawsuit initiated in 1996 by relatives of some of the estimated 600 Spanish citizens who disappeared in Argentina during the \"[[Dirty War]]\", evidence was presented to support the allegation that much of this repression was directed by Ford and the other major industrial firms. According to a 5,000-page report, Ford executives drew up lists of \"subversive\" workers and handed them over to the military task-forces which were allowed to operate within the factories. These groups allegedly kidnapped, tortured and murdered workers&mdash;at times allegedly within the plants themselves. The company denied the allegations.\n\nIn a second trial, a report brought by the [[Argentine Workers' Center|CTA]], and the testimonies of former Ford workers themselves, claimed that the company's Argentine factory was used between 1976 and 1978 as a detention center, and that management allowed the military to set up its own bunker inside the plant.
