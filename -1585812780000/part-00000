[[Visual art]] [[art#Forms, genres, media and styles|can be classified in diverse ways]], such as separating [[fine art]]s from [[applied arts]]; inclusively focusing on human creativity; or focusing on different media such as [[architecture]], [[sculpture]], [[painting]], [[film]], [[photography]], and [[graphic arts]]. In recent years, technological advances have led to [[video]] art, [[Digital art|computer art]], [[Performance art]], [[animation]], [[television]], and [[Video game|videogames]].\n\nThe history of art is often told as a chronology of [[masterpiece]]s created during each [[civilization]]. It can thus be framed as a story of [[high culture]], epitomized by the [[Wonders of the World]]. On the other hand, [[vernacular]] art expressions can also be integrated into art historical narratives, referred to as [[folk arts]] or [[craft]]. The more closely that an art historian engages with these latter forms of [[low culture]], the more likely it is that they will identify their work as examining [[visual culture]] or [[material culture]], or as contributing to fields related to art history, such as [[anthropology]] or [[archaeology]]. In the latter cases, art objects may be referred to as [[Artifact (archaeology)|archeological artifacts]].\n\n==Prehistory==\n{{Main|Prehistoric art}}\n[[File:Homo Erectus shell with geometric incisions circa 500,000 BP, Naturalis Biodiversity Center, Netherlands (with detail).jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|This ''[[Homo erectus]]'' shell with geometric incisions, has been claimed as the first known work of art; circa 500,000 BP; From [[Trinil]] ([[Java]]); [[Naturalis Biodiversity Center]] ([[Netherlands]])<ref name=\"Nature Article\">{{cite journal |last1=Callaway |first1=Ewen |title=Homo erectus made world's oldest doodle 500,000 years ago |journal=Nature News |doi=10.1038/nature.2014.16477 |url=https://www.nature.com/news/homo-erectus-made-world-s-oldest-doodle-500-000-years-ago-1.16477 |language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"NS\"/>]]\n[[File:Stone Age Animal Carving, Hayonim Cave, 28000 BP.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Carving of a horse with traces of [[ocher]] painting; 40,000\u201318,500 BP; from the [[Hayonim Cave]], [[Levantine Aurignacian]]; [[Israel Museum]] ([[Jerusalem]]).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Yi\u015bra\u02bcel (Jerusalem) |first1=Muze\u02bcon |last2=Museum (Jerusalem) |first2=Israel |title=Treasures of the Holy Land: Ancient Art from the Israel Museum |date=1986 |publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art |isbn=9780870994708 |page=29 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KPVTCRYPfFMC&pg=PA29 |language=en}}</ref><ref>\"Horse from Hayonim Cave, Israel, 30,000 years\" in {{cite book |title=Israel Museum Studies in Archaeology |date=2002 |publisher=Samuel Bronfman Biblical and Archaeological Museum of the Israel Museum |page=10 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w7NtAAAAMAAJ |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Hayonim horse |url=https://museums.gov.il/en/items/Pages/ItemCard.aspx?IdItem=ICMS_IMJ_330094 |website=museums.gov.il}}</ref><ref name=\"BY\">{{cite book |last1=Bar-Yosef |first1=Ofer |last2=Belfer-Cohen |first2=Anna |title=The Aurignacian at Hayonim Cave |date=1981 |pages=35\u201336 |url=https://www.persee.fr/doc/paleo_0153-9345_1981_num_7_2_4296}}</ref> This may be one of the earliest known manifestation of human art, together with [[:File:Claimed Oldest Known Drawing by Human Hands Discovered in South African Cave.jpg|the ocher pieces]] of [[Blombos Cave]] in [[South Africa]], before the outpouring of [[parietal art]] in Europe.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sale |first1=Kirkpatrick |title=After Eden: The Evolution of Human Domination |date=2006 |publisher=Duke University Press |isbn=9780822339380 |page=57 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2q9780EgEBEC&pg=PA57 |language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"NYT-20180912\"/>]]\nEngraved shells created by ''[[Homo erectus]]'' dating as far back as 500,000 years ago have been found, although experts disagree on whether these engravings can be properly classified as \u2018art\u2019.<ref name=\"Nature Article\"/><ref name=\"NS\">{{cite journal |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22429983.200-shell-art-made-300000-years-before-humans-evolved.html |title=Shell 'art' made 300,000 years before humans evolved |journal=[[New Scientist]] |first=Catherine |last=Brahic |date=3 December 2014 |access-date=29 September 2018}}</ref> A number of claims of ''[[Neanderthal]]'' art, adornment, and structures have been made, dating from around 130,000 before present and suggesting that Neanderthals may have been capable of [[Symbolic behavior|symbolic thought]],<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=ScienceDaily|title=Neanderthals were not inferior to modern humans, study finds|date=April 30, 2014|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/04/140430133054.htm}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Sci News|last=E.|first=de Lazaro|date=January 18, 2017|title=Neanderthals Capable of Incorporating Symbolic Objects into Their Culture, Discovery Suggests|url=http://www.sci-news.com/archaeology/neanderthals-symbolic-objects-04545.html}}</ref> but none of these claims are widely accepted.<ref>{{cite magazine|author=N.

It is clear that such workmanship existed by 40,000 years ago in the [[Upper Paleolithic]] era, although it is quite possible that it began earlier.\n\nThe artistic manifestations of the Upper-Paleolithic reached their peak in the [[Magdalenian]] period (\u00b115,000\u20138,000&nbsp;BC). Surviving art from this period includes small carvings in stone or bone and [[cave painting]]. The first traces of human-made objects appeared in southern [[Africa]], the [[Western Mediterranean]], [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]] ([[Adriatic Sea]]), [[Siberia]] ([[Baikal Lake]]), India and Australia. These first traces are generally worked stone ([[flint]], [[obsidian]]), wood or [[bone]] tools. To [[painting|paint]] in [[red]], [[iron oxide]] was used.  Cave paintings have been found in the [[Franco-Cantabrian region]]. There are pictures that are [[Abstract art|abstract]] as well as pictures that are [[naturalism (visual art)|naturalistic]].  Animals were painted in the caves of [[Cave of Altamira|Altamira]], [[Trois Fr\u00e8res]], [[Chauvet Cave|Chauvet]] and [[Lascaux]]. [[Sculpture]] is represented by the so-called ''[[Venus figurines]]'', feminine figures which may have been used in [[fertility cult]]s, such as the ''[[Venus of Willendorf]]''.{{sfn|Gardner|Kleiner|2009|pp=3\u20134}} There is a theory that these figures may have been made by women as expressions of their own body.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=McCoid|first1=Catherine Hodge |last2=McDermott |first2=Leroy D. |date=1996|title=Toward Decolonizing Gender: Female Vision in the Upper Paleolithic|jstor=682890|journal=American Anthropologist |volume=98|issue=2|pages=319\u2013326|doi=10.1525/aa.1996.98.2.02a00080}}</ref> Other representative works of this period are the ''Man from [[Brno]]''<ref name=\"google\">{{cite book|title=A World History of Art|author1=Honour, H.|author2=Fleming, J. |date=2005|publisher=Laurence King|isbn=978-1-85669-451-3|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qGb4pyoseH4C&pg=PT38|accessdate=2015-11-20}}</ref> and ''[[Venus of Brassempouy]]''.<ref>Honour-Fleming (2002), pp. 36\u201344.</ref>\n\nThe main function of Paleolithic art was magical, being used in rituals.

The term [[Epipaleolithic]] is often used synonymously, especially for outside [[northern Europe]], and for the corresponding period in [[Epipaleolithic Near East|the Levant]] and [[Epipaleolithic Caucasus|Caucasus]]. The Mesolithic has different time spans in different parts of Eurasia. It refers to the final period of [[hunter-gatherer]] cultures in Europe and West Asia, between the end of the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] and the [[Neolithic Revolution]]. In Europe it spans roughly 15,000 to 5,000&nbsp;BP, in Southwest Asia (the [[Epipalaeolithic Near East]]) roughly 20,000 to 8,000&nbsp;BP.\nThe term is less used of areas further east, and not at all beyond Eurasia and North Africa.\n\n===Neolithic===\n{{Main|Neolithic}}\nThe Neolithic period began about 10,000 BC. The [[rock art of the Iberian Mediterranean Basin]]\u2014dated between the Mesolithic and Neolithic eras\u2014contained small, schematic paintings of human figures, with notable examples in [[Roca dels Moros|El Cogul]], Valltorta, [[Alpera]] and Minateda.\n\nNeolithic painting is similar to paintings found in northern Africa ([[Atlas Mountains|Atlas]], Sahara) and in the area of modern Zimbabwe. Neolithic painting is often schematic, made with basic strokes (men in the form of a [[cross]] and women in a [[triangle|triangular]] shape). There are also cave paintings in [[Pinturas River]] in [[Argentina]], especially the [[Cueva de las Manos]]. In [[portable art]], a style called [[Cardium pottery]] was produced, decorated with imprints of [[seashell]]s. New materials were used in art, such as [[amber]], [[crystal]], and [[jasper]]. In this period, the first traces of urban planning appeared, such as the remains in [[Jericho#Tell es-Sultan|Tell as-Sultan]] ([[Jericho]]), [[Jarmo]] (Iraq) and [[\u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck]] ([[Anatolia]]).{{sfn|Onians|2004|pp=20\u201325}} In South-Eastern Europe appeared many cultures, such as the [[Cucuteni-Trypillia culture]] (from [[Romania]], [[Republic of Moldova]] and [[Ukraine]]), and the [[Hamangia culture]] (from Romania and [[Bulgaria]]). Other regions with many cultures are China, most notable being the [[Yangshao culture]] and the [[Longshan culture]]; and Egypt, with the [[Badarian culture|Badarian]], the [[Naqada I]], [[Naqada II|II]] and [[Naqada III|III]] cultures.\n\nCommon materials of neolithic sculptures from [[Anatolia]], are ivory, stone, clay and bone. Many are [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]], especially female, [[zoomorphism|zoomorphic]] ones being rare. Female figurines are both fat and slender. Both zoomorphic and anthropomorphic carvings have been discovered in [[Siberia]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]] and [[China]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Drimba|first1=Ovidiu|title= Istoria Culturii \u0219i Civiliza\u021biei|date=1985|publisher=Editura \u0219tiin\u021bific\u0103 \u0219i enciclopedic\u0103|isbn=|page=52|url=|language=ro}}</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nFile:Urfa man.jpg|The ''[[Urfa Man]]''; from modern-day [[Turkey]]; c. 9000 BC; [[sandstone]]; height: 1.8 m; [[\u015eanl\u0131urfa Archaeology and Mosaic Museum]] ([[Urfa]], Turkey)\nFile:Bowl fragment MET DP368821.jpg|Fragment of a bowl; by [[Halaf culture]] from [[Mesopotamia]]; 5600-5000 BC; cermaic; 8.2&nbsp;cm; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\nClay vase. 6th millennia B.C.jpg|Globular jar; by [[Dimini#Neolithic|Dimini culture]] from Greece; 5300-4800 BC; ceramic; height: 25&nbsp;cm (9{{fraction|3|4}} in.), diameter at rim: 12&nbsp;cm (4{{fraction|3|4}} in.); [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens|National Archaeological Museum]] ([[Athens]])\n\u601d\u60f3\u8005\u5851\u50cf.JPG|''The Thinker''; by [[Hamangia culture]] from Romania; c. 5000 BC; terracotta; height: 11.5&nbsp;cm (4{{1/2}} in.); [[National Museum of Romanian History]] ([[Bucharest]])\nSerbia, Vin\u00e7a culture, Neolithic Era - Vinca Idol - 2000.201 - Cleveland Museum of Art.tif|Female figure; by [[Vin\u010da culture]] from [[Serbia]]; 4500-3500 BC; fired clay with paint; overall: 16.1&nbsp;cm; [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] ([[Ohio]], US)\nPredynastic bearded man-MGR Lyon-IMG 9928.jpg|Figurine of a bearded man; by the [[Naqada I]] culture from Egypt; 3800-3500 BC; [[breccia]]; from [[Upper Egypt]]; [[Mus\u00e9e des Confluences]] ([[Lyon]], France)\nClevelandart 1984.68.jpg|`Flame-style\u2019 vessel; from the [[J\u014dmon period]] of Japan; c. 2750 BC; earthenware with carved and applied decoration; height: 61&nbsp;cm, diameter: 55.8&nbsp;cm; [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] ([[Ohio]], US)\n\u534a\u5c71\u7c7b\u578b\u5706\u70b9\u7eb9\u5f69\u9676\u58f6.jpg|Dotted pottery pot, semi-mountain type; by the [[Yangshao culture]] from China; 2700\u20132300 BC; [[Gansu Provincial Museum]] ([[Lanzhou]]; China)\n</gallery>\n\n===Metal Age===\n[[File:Solvognen-00100.tif|thumb|left|250px|''[[Trundholm sun chariot]]''; c. 1400 BC; bronze; height: 35 cm (14 in.), width: 54 cm (21 in.); [[National Museum of Denmark]] ([[Copenhagen]])]]\nThe last prehistoric phase is the Metal Age (or [[Three-age system]]), during which the use of [[copper]], [[bronze]] and [[iron]] transformed ancient societies. When humans could smelt metal and forge metal implements could make new tools, weapons, and art.\n\nIn the [[Chalcolithic]] (Copper Age) [[megalith]]s emerged. Examples include the [[dolmen]] and [[menhir]] and the [[England|English]] [[wikt:cromlech|cromlech]], as can be seen in the complexes at [[Newgrange]] and [[Stonehenge]].{{sfn|Gardner|Kleiner|2009|p=12}} In Spain the [[Los Millares]] culture was formed which was characterized by the [[Beaker culture]]. In [[Malta]], the [[Megalithic Temples of Malta|temple complexes]] of [[\u0126a\u0121ar Qim]], [[Mnajdra]], [[Tarxien Temples|Tarxien]] and [[\u0120gantija]] were built. In the [[Balearic Islands]] notable megalithic cultures developed, with different types of monuments: the ''[[naveta]]'', a tomb shaped like a truncated [[pyramid]], with an elongated burial chamber; the ''[[taula]]'', two large stones, one put vertically and the other horizontally above each other; and the ''[[talaiot]]'', a tower with a covered chamber and a false [[dome]].<ref>Azc\u00e1rate (1983), pp. 24\u201328.</ref>\n\nIn the [[Iron Age]] the cultures of [[Hallstatt]] (Austria) and [[La Tene]] ([[Switzerland]]) emerged in Europe. The first was developed between the 7th and 5th century BC by the [[List of necropoleis|necropoleis]] with tumular tombs and a wooden burial chamber in the form of a house, often accompanied by a four-wheeled cart. The pottery was [[Polychrome|polychromic]], with [[geometry|geometric]] decorations and applications of metallic ornaments. La Tene was developed between the 5th and 4th century BC, and is more popularly known as early [[Celtic art]]. It produced many iron objects such as [[sword]]s and [[spear]]s, which have not survived well to the 2000s due to rust.\n\nThe [[Bronze Age]] refers to the period when bronze was the best material available.  Bronze was used for highly decorated [[shield]]s, [[Fibula (brooch)|fibulas]], and other objects, with different stages of evolution of the style. Decoration was influenced by [[Art in Ancient Greece|Greek]], [[Etruscan art|Etruscan]] and [[Scythian art]].{{sfn|Onians|2004|pp=30\u201331}}\n\n==Ancient art==\n{{Main|Ancient art}}\n[[File:Gudea of Lagash Girsu.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Statues of Gudea|Statue of Gudea I]]'', dedicated to the god Ningishzida; 2120&nbsp;BC (the [[Neo-Sumerian]] period); [[diorite]]; height: 46 cm, width: 33 cm, depth: 22.5 cm; [[Louvre]]]]\nIn the first period of recorded history, art coincided with [[writing]]. The great civilizations of the [[Near East]]: [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] and [[Mesopotamia]] arose. Globally, during this period the first great cities appeared near major rivers: the [[Nile]], [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]], [[Indus]] and [[Yellow River|Yellow]] Rivers.\n\nOne of the great advances of this period was writing, which was developed from the tradition of communication using pictures. The first form of writing were the [[Jiahu symbols]] from neolithic China, but the first true writing was [[cuneiform script]], which emerged in Mesopotamia c. 3500&nbsp;BC, written on [[clay]] tablets. It was based on [[Pictogram|pictographic]] and [[Ideogram|ideographic]] elements, while later Sumerians developed [[syllable]]s for writing, reflecting the [[phonology]] and [[syntax]] of the [[Sumerian language]]. In Egypt [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphic writing]] was developed using pictures as well, appearing on art such as the [[Narmer Palette]] (3,100&nbsp;BC). The [[Indus Valley Civilization]] sculpted seals with short texts and decorated with representations of animals and people. Meanwhile, the [[Olmecs]] sculpted [[Olmec colossal heads|colossal heads]] and decorated other sculptures with [[Olmecs#Writing|their own hierglyphs]]. In these times, writing was accessible only for the elites.\n\n===Ancient Near East===\n{{Main|Mesopotamian art}}\n[[Mesopotamian art]] was developed in the area between [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] Rivers in modern-day Syria and Iraq, where since the 4th millennium BC many different cultures existed such as [[Sumer]], [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]], [[Amorite]] and [[Chaldea]]. [[Architecture of Mesopotamia|Mesopotamian architecture]] was characterized by the use of [[brick]]s, [[lintel (architecture)|lintels]], and [[cone mosaic]]. Notable are the [[ziggurat]]s, large [[temple]]s in the form of [[step pyramid]]s. The tomb was a chamber covered with a false [[dome]], as in some examples found at [[Ur]]. There were also [[palace]]s walled with a terrace in the form of a ziggurat, where gardens were an important feature. The [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon]] was one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]].\n\n[[Relief]] sculpture was developed in [[wood carving|wood]] and [[stone]]. Sculpture depicted religious, military, and hunting scenes, including both human and animal figures. In the [[Sumer]]ian period, small statues of people were produced. These statues had an angular form and were produced from colored stone. The figures typically had bald head with hands folded on the chest. In the Akkadian period, statues depicted figures with long hair and beards, such as the [[stele]] of [[Naram-Sin of Akkad|Naram-Sin]]. In the Amorite period (or Neosumerian), statues represented kings from [[Gudea]] of [[Lagash]], with their mantle and a turban on their heads and their hands on their chests. During Babylonian rule, the stele of [[Hammurabi]] was important, as it depicted the great king Hammurabi above a written copy of the laws that he introduced. Assyrian sculpture is notable for its [[anthropomorphism]] of cattle and the [[winged genie]], which is depicted flying in many reliefs depicting war and hunting scenes, such as in the [[Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III|Black Obelisk]] of [[Shalmaneser III]].<ref>Azc\u00e1rate (1983), pp. 36\u201344.</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nStanding male worshiper MET DT850.jpg|Standing male worshipper, one of the twelve statues in the [[Tell Asmar Hoard]]; 2900-2600 BC; gypsum alabaster, shell, black limestone and bitumen; 29.5 \u00d7 12.9 \u00d7 10&nbsp;cm; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]\nSumerian Statues from Eshnunna and Khafajah of Diyala region, Iraq Museum.jpg|Sumerian Statues of worshippers (males and females); 2800-2400 BC ([[Early Dynastic Period (Mesopotamia)|Early Dynastic period]]); [[National Museum of Iraq]] ([[Baghdad]])\nBull's head ornament for a lyre MET DP260070.jpg|Bull's head ornament from a lyre; 2600-2350 BC; bronze inlaid with shell and [[lapis lazuli]]; height: 13.3&nbsp;cm, width: 10.5&nbsp;cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\nRaminathicket2.jpg|A ''[[Ram in a Thicket]]''; 2600\u20132400 BC; gold, copper, shell, [[lapis lazuli]] and [[limestone]]; height: 45.7&nbsp;cm (1&nbsp;ft 6 in.); [[British Museum]] (London)\nDenis Bourez - British Museum, London (8747049029) (2).jpg|The ''[[Standard of Ur]]''; 1600\u20131400 BC (the Early Dynastic Period III); shell, red limestone and lapis lazuli on wood; height: 21.7&nbsp;cm, length: 50.4&nbsp;cm; discovered at the [[Royal Cemetery at Ur]] ([[Dhi Qar Governorate]], Iraq); British Museum\nEbih-Il Louvre AO17551 n01.jpg|The ''[[Statue of Ebih-Il]]''; c. 2400 BC; [[gypsum]], [[schist]], shells and lapis lazuli; height: 52.5&nbsp;cm; [[Louvre]] (Paris)\nSumerian Cylinder Seal of King Ur-Nammu.jpg|Seal of Hash-hamer, showing enthroned king [[Ur-Nammu]], with modern impression; circa 2100 BC; greenstone; height: 5.3&nbsp;cm; [[British Museum]] (London)\nGenie benisseur (3565923284).jpg|[[Assyria]]n relief with a [[winged genie]] with [[bucket and cone]]; 713-706 BC; height: 3.3 m, width: 2.1 m; Louvre\n</gallery>\n\n===Egypt===\n{{Main|Ancient Egyptian art}}\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align = left\n| total_width = 650\n| direction = horizontal\n| footer =\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1 = \n}}\nOne of the first great civilizations arose in [[Egypt]], which had elaborate and complex works of art produced by professional artists and craftspeople. Egypt's art was religious and symbolic. Given that the culture had a highly centralized power structure and hierarchy, a great deal of art was created to honour the [[pharaoh]], including great monuments. Egyptian art and culture emphasized the religious concept of immortality. Later Egyptian art includes [[Coptic art|Coptic]] and [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] art.\n\nThe [[Ancient Egyptian architecture|architecture]] is characterized by monumental structures, built with large stone blocks, lintels, and solid [[column]]s. Funerary monuments included [[mastaba]], tombs of rectangular form; [[pyramid]]s, which included step pyramids ([[Saqqarah]]) or smooth-sided pyramids ([[Giza]]); and the [[hypogeum]], underground tombs ([[Valley of the Kings]]). Other great buildings were the [[temple]], which tended to be monumental complexes preceded by an avenue of [[sphinx]]es and [[obelisk]]s. Temples used [[pylon (architecture)|pylons]] and [[trapezoid]] walls with [[hypaethros]] and [[hypostyle]] halls and [[shrine]]s. The temples of [[Karnak]], [[Luxor]], [[Philae]] and [[Edfu]] are good examples. Another type of temple is the [[rock temple]], in the form of a [[hypogeum]], found in [[Abu Simbel]] and [[Deir el-Bahari]].\n\nPainting of the Egyptian era used a juxtaposition of overlapping planes. The images were represented hierarchically, i.e., the Pharaoh is larger than the common subjects or enemies depicted at his side.

In the [[Shang dynasty]] (c. 1600\u20131050 BC), the supreme deity was [[Shangdi]], but aristocratic families preferred to contact the spirits of their ancestors. They prepared elaborate banquets of food and drink for them, heated and served in [[Chinese ritual bronzes|bronze ritual vessels]]. Bronze vessels were used in religious rituals to cement Dhang authority, and when the Shang capital fell, around 1050 BC, its conquerors, the Zhou (c. 1050\u2013156 BC), continued to use these containers in religious rituals, but principally for food rather than drink. The Shang court had been accused of excessive drunkenness, and the Zhou, promoting the imperial [[Tian]] (\"Heaven\") as the prime spiritual force, rather than ancestors, limited wine in religious rites, in favour of food. The use of ritual bronzes continued into the early [[Han dynasty]] (206 BC\u2013220 AD).\n\nOne of the most commonly used motifs was the ''[[taotie]]'', a stylized face divided centrally into 2 almost mirror-image halves, with nostrils, eyes, eyebrows, jaws, cheeks and horns, surrounded by incised patterns. Whether ''taotie'' represented real, mythological or wholly imaginary creatures cannot be determined.\n\nThe enigmatic bronzes of [[Sanxingdui]]. near [[Guanghan]] (in [[Sichuan province]]), are evidence for a mysterious sacrificial religious system unlike anything elsewhere in [[ancient China]] and quite different from the art of the contemporaneous Shang at [[Anyang]]. Excavations at Sanxingdui since 1986 have revealed 4 pits containing artefacts of [[bronze]], [[jade]] and [[gold]]. There was found a great bronze statue of a human figure which stands on a plinth decorated with abstract elephant heads. Besides the standing figure, the first 2 pits contained over 50 bronze heads, some wearing headgear and 3 with a frontal covering of [[gold leaf]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nBronze Standing Figure.jpg|Standing statue of a king and shaman leader; c. 1200\u20131000 BC; probably bronze; total height: 2.62 m; [[Sanxingdui Museum]] ([[Guanghan]], [[Sichuan]] province, China)\nHouMuWuDingFullView.jpg|''[[Houmuwu ding]]'', the largest ancient bronze ever found; 1300\u20131046 BC; bronze; [[National Museum of China]] (Beijing)\nMET DP219959.jpg|Altar set; late 11th century BC; bronze; overall (table): height: 18.1&nbsp;cm, width: 46.4&nbsp;cm, depth: 89.9&nbsp;cm; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\nPOL 3596-Editar (15708757686).jpg|One of the warriors of the ''[[Terracotta Army]]'', a famous collection of terracotta sculptures depicting the armies of [[Qin Shi Huang]], the first [[Emperor of China]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Greek===\n{{main|Ancient Greek art}}\n\nEven in antiquity, the arts of Greece were recognised by other cultures as pre-eminent. The Latin poet [[Horace]], writing in the age of [[Roman Empire|Roman]] emperor [[Augustus]] (1st century BC to 1st century AD), famously remarked that although conquered on the battlefield, `captive Greece overcame its savage conqueror and brought the arts to rustic Rome.\u2019 The power of Greek art lies in its representation of the human figure and its focus on human beings and the anthropomorphic gods as chief subjects. The [[Classical Greece|Classical period]] (5th and 4th centuries BC), realism and idealism were delicately balanced. In comparison, work of the earlier Geometric (9th to 8th centuries BC) and Archaic (7th to 6th centuries BC) ages sometimes appears primitive, but these artists had different goals: naturalistic representation was not necessarily their aim. [[Roman art]] lover collected ancient Greek originals, Roman replicas of Greek art, or newly created paintings and sculptures fashioned in a variety of Greek styles, thus preserving for posterity works of art otherwise lost. Wall and panel paintings, sculptures and mosaics decorated public spaces and well-to-do private homes. Greek imagery also appeared on Roman jewellery, vessels of gold, silver, bronze and terracotta, and even on weapons and commercial weights. Since the [[Renaissance]], the arts of ancient Greece, transmitted through the [[Roman Empire]], have served as the foundation of Western art.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fortenberry|first1=Diane|title=THE ART MUSEUM |date=2017|publisher=Phaidon|isbn=978 0 7148 7502 6|page=25|url=|language=en}}</ref>\n\n====Pre-Classical====\n{{further|Cycladic art|Minoan art}}\n[[Greek art|Greek]] and [[Etruscan art|Etruscan]] artists built on the artistic foundations of Egypt, further developing the arts of sculpture, painting, architecture, and ceramics.

The Protogeometric (circa 1050\u2013900 BC) and succeeding Geometric (circa 900\u2013700 BC) styles are characterised by their stark simplicity Of decoration, as older floral and marine motifs were replaced with abstract patterns. In the new styles, pattern was rigorously applied to shape, each decorative element subordinate to but enhancing the whole. Surfaces were adorned with triangles, lines and semicircles, and concentric circles made with a multiple brush attached to a compass. The ''meander'' (''[[Meander (art)|Greek key]]'') pattern was popular, as were chequerboards, diamonds, chevrons and stars. Geometric figures, whether painted or sculpted, conform to an abstract aesthetic.

This period falls under the Anatolian [[Bronze Age]]. It is characterized by a long tradition of canonized images and motifs rearranged, while still being recognizable, by artists to convey meaning to a largely illiterate population. <blockquote>\"Owing to the limited vocabulary of figural types [and motifs], invention for the Hittite artist usually was a matter of combining and manipulating the units to form more complex compositions\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Sculpture and Sculptors of Yaz\u0131l\u0131kaya|last=Alexander|first=Robert L.|publisher=University of Delaware Press|year=1986|isbn=|location=Newark|page=122}}</ref></blockquote>Many of these recurring images revolve around the depiction of [[Hittite mythology and religion|Hittite deities and ritual practices]]. There is also a prevalence of hunting scenes in Hittite relief and representational animal forms. Much of the art comes from settlements like [[Alaca H\u00f6y\u00fck]], or the Hittite capital of [[Hattusa]] near modern-day [[Bo\u011fazkale]].

Most of the pre-Islamic sculptures are made of [[alabaster]].\n\n[[Archaeology]] has revealed some early settled civilizations in [[Saudi Arabia]]: the [[Dilmun]] civilization on the east of the Arabian Peninsula, [[Thamud]] north of the [[Hejaz]], and [[Kindah]] kingdom and [[Al-Magar]] civilization in the central of Arabian Peninsula.\nThe earliest known events in Arabian history are migrations from the peninsula into neighbouring areas.<ref>Philip Khuri Hitti (2002), History of the Arabs, Revised: 10th Edition</ref> In antiquity, the role of [[South Arabia]]n societies such as Saba ([[Sheba]]) in the production and trade of aromatics not only brought such kingdoms wealth but also tied the [[Arabian peninsula]] into trade networks, resulting in far-ranging artistic influences.\n\nIt seems probable that before around 4000 BC the Arabian climate was somewhat wetter that today, benefitting from a monsoon system that has since moved south.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} During the late fourth millennium BC permanent settlements began to appear, and inhabitants adjusted to the emerging dryer conditions. In south-west Arabia (modern [[Yemen]]) a moister climate supported several kingdoms during the second and first millennia BC. The most famos of these is [[Sheba]], the kingdom of the biblical [[Queen of Sheba]]. These societies used a combination of trade in spices and the natural resources of the region, including aromatics such as frankincense and myrrh, to build wealthy kingdoms. [[Ma'rib#Ancient|M\u0101rib]], the [[Sabaeans|Sabaean]] capital, was well positioned to tap into Mediterranean as well as Near Eastern trade, and in kingdoms to the east, in what is today [[Oman]], trading links with [[Mesopotamia]], [[Persia]] and even India were possible. The area was never a part of the [[Assyria]]n or [[Persian empire]]s, and even [[Babylon]]ian control of north-west Arabia seems to have been relatively short-lived.

At a height of {{cvt|11|in|cm|0|order=flip}}, it is one of the largest jade objects ever found in Mesoamerica.<ref>Benson (1996) p. 263.</ref>]]\nThe history of art in the Americas begins in [[Pre-Columbian art|pre-Columbian]] times with [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous cultures]]. Art historians have focused particularly closely on [[Mesoamerica]] during this early era, because a series of stratified cultures arose there that erected grand architecture and produced [[Mesoamerica#Political and religious art|objects of fine workmanship]] that are comparable to the arts of Western Europe.\n\n===Preclassic===\nThe art-making tradition of Mesoamerican people begins with the [[Olmec#Art|Olmec]] around 1400&nbsp;BC, during the [[Mesoamerican chronology#Preclassic Era|Preclassic era]]. These people are best known for making [[Olmec colossal heads|colossal heads]] but also carved [[jade]], erected monumental architecture, made small-scale sculpture, and designed mosaic floors. Two of the most well-studied sites artistically are [[San Lorenzo Tenochtitl\u00e1n]] and [[La Venta]]. After the Olmec culture declined, the [[Maya civilization]] became prominent in the region. Sometimes a transitional [[Epi-Olmec culture|Epi-Olmec]] period is described, which is a hybrid of Olmec and Maya. A particularly well-studied Epi-Olmec site is [[La Mojarra]], which includes hieroglyphic carvings that have been partially deciphered.\n\n===Classic===\n[[File:Mascara Dios Murcielago.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]] mosaic mask that represents a Bat god, made of 25 pieces of jade, with yellow eyes made of shell. It was found in a tomb at [[Monte Alban]]]]\nBy the late pre-Classic era, beginning around 400&nbsp;BC, the Olmec culture had declined but both Central Mexican and Maya peoples were thriving. Throughout much of the Classic period in Central Mexico, the city of [[Teotihuacan]] was thriving, as were [[Xochicalco]] and [[El Tajin]]. These sites boasted grand sculpture and architecture. Other Central Mexican peoples included the [[Mixtec#Language, codices, and artwork|Mixtecs]], the [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotecs]], and people in the [[Valley of Oaxaca]]. [[Maya art]] was at its height during the \"Classic\" period\u2014a name that mirrors that of [[Classical antiquity|Classical European antiquity]]\u2014and which began around 200 CE. Major Maya sites from this era include [[Copan]], where numerous stelae were carved, and [[Quirigua]] where the largest stelae of Mesoamerica are located along with [[zoomorphic]] altars. A complex [[writing system]] was developed, and [[Maya codices|Maya illuminated manuscripts]] were produced in large numbers on paper made from [[Bark (botany)|tree bark]]. Many sites [[Maya collapse|\"collapsed\"]] around 1000 CE.\n\n===Postclassic===\nAt the time of the [[Spanish conquest of Yucat\u00e1n]] during the 16th and 17th centuries, the Maya were still powerful, but many communities were paying tribute to [[Aztec society]]. The latter culture was thriving, and it included [[Aztec#Arts|arts]] such as sculpture, painting, and feather mosaics. Perhaps the most well-known work of Aztec art is the [[Aztec sun stone|calendar stone]], which became a national symbol of the state of [[Mexico]]. During the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]], many of these artistic objects were sent to Europe, where they were placed in [[cabinets of curiosities]], and later redistributed to Western art museums. The Aztec empire was based in the city of [[Tenochtitlan]] which was largely destroyed during the colonial era. What remains of it was buried beneath [[Mexico City]]. A few buildings, such as the foundation of the [[Templo Mayor]] have since been unearthed by archaeologists, but they are in poor condition.\n\n===Art in the Americas===\nArt in the Americas since the conquest is characterized by a mixture of indigenous and foreign traditions, including those of European, African, and Asian settlers. Numerous indigenous traditions thrived after the conquest. For example, the [[Plains Indians]] created [[quillwork]], [[beadwork]], [[winter count]]s, [[ledger art]], and [[tipi]]s in the pre-reservation era, and afterwards became assimilated into the world of Modern and Contemporary art through institutions such as the [[Santa Fe Indian School]] which encouraged students to develop a unique Native American style. Many paintings from that school, now called the Studio Style, were exhibited at the [[Philbrook Museum of Art]] during its Indian annual held from 1946 to 1979.\n\n===Aztec===\n{{main|Aztecs#Art and cultural production}}\n[[File:Maize Deity (Chicomecoatl) MET DT5110.jpg|thumb|225px|Maize deity ([[Chicomecoatl]]); 15th\u2013early 16th century; basalt; overall: 35.56 x 18.11 x 8.89 cm; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)]]\nArising from the humblest beginnings as a nomadic group of \"uncivilizated\" wanderers, the Aztecs created the largest empire in Mesoamerican history, lasting from 1427/1428 to 1521. Tribute from conquered states provided the economic and artistic resources to transform their capital [[Tenochtitlan]] (0ld [[Mexico City]]) into one of the wonders of the world. Artists from throughout mesoamerica created stunning artworks for their new masters, fashioning delicate golden objects of personal adornment and formidable sculptures of fierce gods.\n\nThe Aztecs entered the Valley of Mexico (the area of modern [[Mexico City]]) in 1325 and within a century had taken control of this lush region brimming with powerful city-states. Their power was based on unbending faith in the vision of their patron deity [[Huitzilopochtli]], a god of war, and in their own unparalleled military prowess.\n\nThe grandiosity of the Aztec state was reflected in the comportment of the nobility and warriors who had distinguished themselves in battle. Their finely woven and richly embellished clothing was accentuated by iridescent tropical bird feathers and ornate jewellery made of gold, silver, semi-precious stones and rare shells.\n\nAztec art may be direct and dramatic or subtle and delicate, depending on the function of the work. The finest pieces, from monumental sculptures to masks and gold jewellery, display outstanding craftsmanship and aesthetic refinement. This same sophistication characterizes Aztec poetry, which was renowned for its lyrical beauty and spiritual depth. Aztec feasts were not complete without a competitive exchange of verbal artistry among the finely dressed noble guests.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nXiuhtecuhtli (mask).jpg|The Mask of Xiuhtecuhtli; 1400\u20131521; cedrela wood, turquoise, pine resin, mother-of-pearl, conch shell, [[cinnabar]]; height: 16.8 cm, width: 15.2 cm; [[British Museum]] (London)\n\nMixtechi-aztechi, maschera di tezcatlipoca con mosaico in turchese, 1400-1521 circa, 0.JPG|The Mask of [[Tezcatlipoca]]; 1400\u20131521; turquoise, [[pyrite]], [[pine]], [[lignite]], human bone, deer skin, conch shell and [[agave]]; height: 19 cm, width: 13.9 cm, length: 12.2 cm; British Museum\n\nFile:Double headed turquoise serpentAztecbritish museum.jpg|[[Double-headed serpent]]; 1450\u20131521; [[cedro]] wood (''Cedrela odorata''), [[turquoise]], shell, traces of gilding & 2 resins are used as adhesive (pine resin and Bursera resin); height: 20.3&nbsp;cm, width: 43.3&nbsp;cm, depth: 5.9&nbsp;cm; British Museum\n\nCodex Borbonicus (p. 14).jpg|Page 12 of the [[Codex Borbonicus]], (in the big square): [[Tezcatlipoca]] (night and fate) and [[Quetzalcoatl]] (feathered serpent); before 1500; bast fiber paper; height: 38&nbsp;cm, length of the full manuscript: 142&nbsp;cm; [[Biblioth\u00e8que de l'Assembl\u00e9e nationale (Paris)|Biblioth\u00e8que de l'Assembl\u00e9e nationale]] (Paris)\n\nFile:1479 Stein der f\u00fcnften Sonne, sog.

Its greatest artistic flowering occurred during the seven centuries of the {{C|Mayan Classic Period|Classic Period}} (c. 200 to 900 CE). Ancient Maya art then went through an extended Post-Classic phase before the upheavals of the sixteenth century destroyed courtly culture and put an end to the Mayan artistic tradition. Many regional styles existed, not always coinciding with the changing boundaries of Maya polities. [[Olmec]]s, [[Teotihuacan]] and [[Toltec]]s have all influenced Maya art. Traditional art forms have mainly survived in weaving and the design of peasant houses.\n\nThe [[jade]] artworks count among the most wonderful works of art the Maya have left us. The majority of items found date back to the [[Maya Classic Era|Classic period]], but more and more artefacts dating back to the [[Preclassic Maya|Preclassic]] are being discovered. The earliest of these include simple, unadorned beads found in burials in [[Cuello]] ([[Belize]]) dating back to between 1200 and 900 BC. At the time, stone cutting was already highly developed among the [[Olmecs]], who were already working jade before the Maya. In [[Mesoamerica]], jade is found solely as [[jadeite]]; [[nephrite]], the other variety known as jade, does not exist there. However, in this area of Mesoamerica \"jade\" is a collective term for a number of other green or blue stones. Jade objects were placed in burials, used in rituals and, of course, as jewelry. As well as being used for beads, which were often strung together to make highly ornate pendants and necklaces, they were also used for ear spools, arm, calf and foot bands, belts, pectorals (chest jewelry), and to adorn garments and headdresses.\n\nAncient Maya art is renowned for its aesthetic beauty and narrative content. Of all the media in which Maya artists worked, their paintings on pottery are among the most impressive because of their technical and aesthetical sophistication. These complex pictoral scenes accompanied by hieroglyphic texts recount historic events of the Classic period and reveal the religious ideology upon which the Maya built a great civilization.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nCenser, Seated King MET DT4512.jpg|Seated king-shaped censer; 4th century; ceramic; height: 80 cm, width: 31.1 cm; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\n\nMaya jade plaque.jpg|Jade plaque of a Maya king; 400-800 (Classic period); height: 14&nbsp;cm, width: 14&nbsp;cm; found at [[Teotihuacan]]; [[British Museum]] (London)\n\nMonument 151 de Tonina, prisonnier, exposition \"Mayas\", Mus\u00e9e du Quai Branly, Paris.jpg|Statue depicting a bound prisoner; 600-900 AD; limestone; from [[Tonin\u00e1]] (Mexico); [[Mus\u00e9e du quai Branly \u2013 Jacques Chirac]] (Paris)\n\nFile:K'inich Janaab Pakal I v2.jpg|Portrait of K'inich Janaab Pakal I; 615\u2013683; stucco; height: 43&nbsp;cm; [[National Museum of Anthropology (Mexico)|National Museum of Anthropology]] (Mexico City)\n\nCodex-Style Vase with Mythological Scene MET DP-579-002.jpg|[[Maya ceramics|Codex-style vase]] with a mythological scene; 7th\u20138th century; cdramic; height: 19&nbsp;cm, diameter: 11.2&nbsp;cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nVessel, Throne Scene MET DT4514.jpg|Vessel with a throne scene; late 7th\u20138th century; ceramic; 21.59 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nYaxchilan Lintel 24.jpg|One of the Yaxchilan lintels, this one showing a bloodletting ritual performed by the king of Yaxchilan, and his wife, Lady K'ab'al Xook; 723\u2013726; limestone; height: 108 cm, width: 78 cm; British Museum\n\nFile:Maya Presentation of Captives Kimbell.jpg|Relief showing Aj Chak Maax presenting captives before ruler Itzamnaaj B'alam III of [[Yaxchilan]]; 22 August 783; limestone with traces of pigment; height: 1.15 m; [[Kimbell Art Museum]] ([[Fort Worth]], Texas, US)\n</gallery>\n\n=== Costa Rica and Panama ===\nLong considered a backwater of culture and aesthetic expression, Central America's dynamic societies are now recognized as robust and innovative contributors to the arts of ancient Americas. The people of pre-Columbian [[Nicaragua]], [[Costa Rica]] and [[Panama]] developed their own distinctive styles in spite of the region being a crossroads for millennia. Its peoples were not subsumed by outside influences but instead created, adopted and adapted al manner of ideas and technologies to suit their needs and temperaments. The region's isiosyncratic cultural traditions, religious beliefs and sociopolitical systems are reflected in unique artworks. A fundamental spiritual tenet was shamanism, the central principle of which decreed that in a trance state, transformed into one's spirit companion form, a person could enter the supranatural realm and garner special power to affect worldly affairs. Central American artists devised ingenious ways to portray this transformation by merging into one figure human and animal characteristics; the [[jaguar]], [[Snake|serpent]] and avian raport (falcon, eagle or vulture) were the main spirit forms.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nBird Pendant MET h1 1979.206.1138.jpg|Bird pendant; 1st\u20135th century; [[jadeite]]; height: 6.7&nbsp;cm, width: 1.9&nbsp;cm, depth: 4.7&nbsp;cm; from [[Costa Rica]]; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\nIntermediate Region, Panama, Conte style, 5th-10th Century - Pectoral (Chest Plaque) - 1952.459 - Cleveland Museum of Art.tif|Pectoral; 5th-10th century; gold alloy; overall: 25.1 x 26.7&nbsp;cm; from [[Sitio Conte]] ([[Panama]]); [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] ([[Ohio]], US)\nPanama, Parita style, 11th-14th century - Vessel- Turtle - 1998.30 - Cleveland Museum of Art.tif|Vessel shaped like a turtle's carapace; 11th-14th century; painted ceramic; overall: 22.9 x 29.2&nbsp;cm; from Panama; Cleveland Museum of Art\nDouble Bat-Head Figure Pendant MET DT935.jpg|Pendant with 2 bat-head worriors who carry spears; 11th\u201316th century; gold; overall: 7.62&nbsp;cm (3 in.); from the [[Chiriqui Province]] ([[Panama]]); Metropolitan Museum of Art\n</gallery>\n\n=== Colombia ===\n{{more information|Muisca art}}\n[[Gold]] \u2014 the perpetually brilliant metal of status, wealth and power \u2014 inspired the Spanish to explore the globe and was an essential accoutrement of prestige, authority and religious ideology among the people of Central America and Colombia.\n\nIn Colombia, gold was important for its relationship to thedivine force of the sun. It was part of a complex ideology of universal binary oppositions: male-female, light-dark, the earth and spirit worlds.

The origins of Andean civilization reach back before 3000 BC. Harnessing the challenging environments \u2013 which included the world's driest coastal desert, desolate windswept highlands and formidable mountains \u2013 Andean pre-Columbian people excelled in agriculture, marine fishing and animal husbandry. By 1800 BC ritual and civic buildings elevated on massive adobe platforms dominated the larger settlements, particularly in the coastal river valleys. Two of the first important cultures from this land are the [[Chav\u00edn culture|Chav\u00edn]] and the [[Paracas culture]].\n\nThe [[Moche culture|Moche]] controlled the river valleys of the north coast, while the [[Nazca culture|Nazca]] of southern [[Peru]] held sway along the coastal deserts and contiguous mountains, inheriting the technological advances \u2013 in agriculture and architecture \u2013 as well as the artistic traditions of the earlier [[Paracas culture|Paracas people]]. Both cultures flourished around 100\u2013800 AD. Moche pottery is some of the most varied in the world. The use of [[molding (process)|mold technology]] is evident. This would have enabled the mass production of certain forms. The Following the decline of the Moche, two large co-existing empires emerged in the Andes region. In the north, the [[Huari culture|Wari]] (or Huari) Empire. The Wari are noted for their stone architecture and sculpture accomplishments, but their greatest proficiency was ceramic. The Wari produced magnificent large ceramics, many of which depicted images of the [[Staff God]].\n\nThe Chim\u00fa were preceded by a simple ceramic style known as [[Sican culture#Early Sican|Sic\u00e1n]] (700\u2013900 AD) which became increasingly decorative until it became recognizable as Chim\u00fa in the early second millennium. The Chim\u00fa produced excellent portrait and decorative works in metal, notably gold but especially silver. The Chim\u00fa also are noted for their featherwork, having produced many standards and headdresses made of a variety of tropical feathers which were fashioned into bired and fish designs, both of which were held in high esteem by the Chim\u00fa.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nEstela Raimondi.JPG|The ''[[Raimondi Stela]]''; by [[Chav\u00edn culture]]; 5th-3rd century BC; granite; height: 1.95 (6&nbsp;ft. 6 in.); [[Museo Nacional de Arqueolog\u00eda, Antropolog\u00eda e Historia del Per\u00fa]] ([[Lima]], Peru)\n\nL\u00edneas de Nazca, Nazca, Per\u00fa, 2015-07-29, DD 49.JPG|Aerial photograph of one of the [[Nazca lines]], taken in July 2015.

What survived reveals complex societies whose people created art rich in mythological and spiritual meaning.\n\nThe [[Taino people]], who occupied the Caraibbean islands when the Spanish arrived, were agriculturalists whose society was centred on hereditary chiefs called ''[[cacique]]s''. Their towns included impressively constructed ceremonial plazas in which ball games were played and religious rituals carried on, linking their culture to that of the Maya from the [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]]. Much of Taino art was associated with shamanic rituals and religion, including a ritual in which a shaman or a ''cacique'' enters into a hypnotic state by inhaling the hallucinogetic ''[[cohoba]]'' powder. Sculptures representing the creator god Yocahu often depict a nude male figure in a [[squatting position]] with a slightly concave dish on top of his head, to hold the ''cohoba'' powder. Other figures (always male) stand rigidly frontal, the ostentatious display of their genitals apparently to the importance of fertility. The purpose of these rituals was communication with the ancestors and the spirit world. Chiefs and shamans (often the same person) sometimes interceded with spirit beings from a sculpted stool, or ''duho''.\n\nMeanwhile, the [[Marajoara culture]] flourished on [[Maraj\u00f3|Maraj\u00f3 island]] at the mouth of the [[Amazon River]], in Brazil. Archeologists have found sophisticated [[pottery]] in their excavations on the island. These pieces are large, and elaborately painted and incised with representations of plants and animals. These provided the first evidence that a complex society had existed on Maraj\u00f3. Evidence of [[mound building]] further suggests that well-populated, complex and sophisticated settlements developed on this island, as only such settlements were believed capable of such extended projects as major earthworks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Grann|first=David|title=The Lost City of Z: A Tale of Deadly Obsession in the Amazon|page=[https://archive.org/details/lostcityofztaleo00gran/page/315 315]|year=2009|isbn=978-0-385-51353-1|url=https://archive.org/details/lostcityofztaleo00gran/page/315}}</ref> The pottery that they made is decorated with abastract lines and spirals, suggesting that they probably consumed hallucinogetic plants.

Famous examples include [[totem pole]]s, [[transformation mask]]s, and canoes. In addition to woodwork, two dimensional painting and silver, gold and copper engraved jewelry became important after contact with Europeans.\n\nThe [[Eastern Woodlands]], or simply woodlands, cultures inhabited the regions of North America east of the [[Mississippi River]] at least since 2500 BC. While there were many regionally distinct cultures, trade between them was common and they shared the practice of burying their dead in earthen mounds, which has preserved a large amount of their art. Because of this trait the cultures are collectively known as the [[Mound builder (people)|Mound builders]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nSouthwest, Mogollon, Mimbres, Pre-Contact Period, 11th-12th century - Bowl with Pronghorn Antelope and Geometric Design - 1930.50 - Cleveland Museum of Art.tif|[[Mogollon culture|Mogollon]] bowl with a geometric design and a pronghorn [[antelope]]; 1000\u20131150; earthenware; diameter: 31.2&nbsp;cm, overall: 12.5 x 32&nbsp;cm; [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] ([[Ohio]], US)\nKwakwaka'wakw.

Historically, their preferred medium was [[walrus ivory]], but since the establishment of southern markets for Inuit art in 1945, [[Printmaking|prints]] and figurative works carved in relatively soft stone such as [[soapstone]], [[serpentinite]], or [[argillite]] have also become popular. The range of colors is cold, most encountered being: black, brown, grays, white and gray-blue.\n\nThe [[Winnipeg Art Gallery]] has a large public collection of contemporary Inuit art.<ref>[https://www.wag.ca/about/facts/history History \u2013 Winnipeg Art Gallery]</ref> In 2007, the [[Museum of Inuit Art]] opened in [[Toronto]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.miagallery.ca/ |title=Museum of Inuit Art |access-date=2020-01-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180422032528/http://www.miagallery.ca/ |archive-date=2018-04-22 |url-status=dead }}</ref> but closed due to lack of resources in 2016.<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/canadian-museum-of-inuit-art-closing-1.3541737 'Small but mighty' Canadian Museum of Inuit Art closing its doors]</ref> Carvings Nunavut, owned by Inuk Lori Idlout, opened in 2008 and has grown to have the largest private collection in Nunavut.

One approach to [[Eastern art history]] divides the field by nation, with foci on [[Indian art]], [[Chinese art]], and [[Japanese art]]. Due to the size of the continent, the distinction between Eastern Asia and Southern Asia in the context of arts can be clearly seen. In most of Asia, pottery was a prevalent form of art. The pottery is often decorated with geometric patterns or abstract representations of animals, people or plants. Other very widespread forms of art were, and are, sculpture and painting.\n\n=== Central Asia ===\n{{main|Central Asia#Arts|Steppes art}}\nSuperb samples of [[Steppes art]] \u2013 mostly golden jewellery and trappings for horse \u2013 are found over vast expanses of land stretching from [[Hungary]] to [[Mongolia]]. Dating from the period between the 7th and 3rd centuries BC, the objects are usually diminutive, as may be expected from nomadic people always on the move. Art of the steppes is primarily an [[animal style|animal art]], i.e., combat scenes involving several animals (real or imaginary) or single animal figures (such as golden stags) predominate. The best known of the various peoples involved are the [[Scythians]], at the European end of the steppe, who were especially likely to bury gold items.\n\nAmong the most famous finds was made in 1947, when the Soviet archaeologist [[Sergei Rudenko]] discovered a royal burial at [[Pazyryk burials|Pazyryk]], [[Altay Mountains]], which featured \u2013 among many other important objects \u2013 the most ancient extant [[pile rug]], probably made in Persia.  Unusually for prehistoric burials, those in the northern parts of the area may preserve organic materials such as wood and textiles that normally would decay. Steppes people both gave and took influences from neighbouring cultures from Europe to China, and later Scythian pieces are heavily influenced by ancient Greek style, and probably often made by Greeks in Scythia.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nFinial (Kulan) LACMA M.76.97.603.jpg|Final (kulan); 6th-5th century BC; bronze; 14.5 x 9&nbsp;cm; [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] (US)\nDress ornament MET DT5051.jpg|[[Scythia]]n dress ornaments; 5th century BC; gold; height: 2.54&nbsp;cm; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\nStatua di guerriero, dalla regione di Kosh-Agach, Altai, VIII-X sec.JPG|Warrior statue; 8th-10th century; from the [[Kosh-Agach]] region ([[Altai Republic|Altai]]); [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]] ([[Sankt Petersburg]], Russia)\nCeremonial hanging IMA 50671.jpg|''Suzani'' (ceremonial hanging); late 1700s; cotton; 92 x 63; from [[Uzbekistan]]; [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]] (US)\n</gallery>\n\n===Indian===\n{{main|Indian art}}\nEarly [[Buddhists]] in India developed symbols related to [[Buddha]].  The major survivals of Buddhist art begin in the period after the [[Mauryan Empire|Mauryans]], with in North India [[Kushan Empire|Kushan art]], the [[Greco-Buddhist art]] of [[Gandhara]] and finally the \"classic\" period of [[Gupta art]].  Good quantities of sculpture survives from some key sites such as [[Sanchi]], [[Bharhut]] and [[Amaravati Marbles|Amaravati]], some of which remain ''in situ'', with others in museums in India or around the world. Stupas were surrounded by ceremonial fences with four profusely carved [[torana]]s or ornamental gateways facing the cardinal directions. These are in stone, though clearly adopting forms developed in wood. They and the walls of the stupa itself can be heavily decorated with reliefs, mostly illustrating the lives of the Buddha. Gradually life-size figures were sculpted, initially in deep relief, but then free-standing.<ref>Harle, 26\u201347, 105\u2013117</ref> [[Mathura art]] was the most important centre in this development, which applied to Hindu and Jain art as well as Buddhist.<ref>Harle, 59\u201370</ref>  The facades and interiors of rock-cut ''[[chaitya]]'' prayer halls and monastic ''[[vihara]]s'' have survived better than similar free-standing structures elsewhere, which were for long mostly in wood. The caves at [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]], [[Karla Caves|Karle]], [[Bhaja Caves|Bhaja]] and elsewhere contain early sculpture, often outnumbered by later works such as iconic figures of the Buddha and [[bodhisattva]]s, which are not found before 100 AD at the least.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nHead and chest of a lion-66.233-IMG 5523.JPG|Head and chest of a lion; circa 5th century; [[sandstone]]; height: 61 cm, width: 35.6 cm; [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts]] ([[Boston]], US)\n\nBuddha in Sarnath Museum (Dhammajak Mutra).jpg|Seated Buddha; circa 475; sandstone; height: 1.6 m; [[Sarnath Museum]] (India)\n\nFile:Shrine with Four Jinas (Rishabhanatha (Adinatha)), Parshvanatha, Neminatha, and Mahavira) LACMA M.85.55 (1 of 4).jpg|''Chaumukha'' idol; circa 600; sandstone; 58.42 x 43.18 x 44.45 cm; [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] (US)\n\nFile:022 Cave 1, Padmapani (33896247830).jpg|''Bodhisattva Padmapani''; 450\u2013490; pigments on rock; height: circa 1.2 m; [[Ajanta Caves]] (India)\n\n\nFour-headed god Harihara, Kashmir, 9th century AD, soapstone - Ethnological Museum, Berlin - DSC01606.JPG|Four-headed god [[Harihara]]; 9th century; [[soapstone]]; from [[Kashmir]] (India); [[Ethnological Museum of Berlin]] (Germany)\n\nBodhisattva Lokeshvara Museum Rietberg RVI 106.jpg|[[Bodhisattva]] Lokeshvara (as \"Lord of the World\"); 9th century; [[basalt]]; [[Rietberg Museum]] ([[Z\u00fcrich]], Switzerland)\n\nIndia, Bihar, 10th century - Model of the Sikhara of a Buddhist Temple - 1971.167 - Cleveland Museum of Art.tif|Model of the [[sikhara]] of a Buddhist temple; 900s; [[kaolinite]]; 28 x 9 x 9 cm; [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] ([[Cleveland]], USA)\n\nMET DT240.jpg|''[[Nataraja]]''; circa 11th century; copper alloy; height: 68.3&nbsp;cm, diameter: 56.5&nbsp;cm; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\n\nGanesha Museum Rietberg.jpg|Statue of [[Ganesh]]; 11th century; sandstone; Rietberg Museum\n\nElephant Hunt of Maharaja Anup Singh of Bikaner - Google Art Project.jpg|Elephant hunt of Maharaja Anup Singh of Bikaner; 1690\u20131700; opaque watercolor, gold and silver on paper; height: 31.1 cm, width: 39.4 cm; [[Cincinnati Art Museum]] ([[Cincinnati]], US)\n\nPortrait of Shah Jahan on the Peacock Throne.jpg|Portrait of Shah Jahan on the Peacock Throne; 19th century; height of the page: 37.2&nbsp;cm, height of the painting: 16.5&nbsp;cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nIndia, Bundi, 19th century - Painted Door - 1977.60.2 - Cleveland Museum of Art.jpg|Painted door; 1815; color on wood; overall: 190 x 88.9 x 43.7 cm; Cleveland Museum of Art\n</gallery>\n\n=== Nepalese, Bhutanese, and Tibetan ===\n{{Main|Newa art|Bhutanese art|Tibetan art}}\nFor more than a thousand years, [[Tibetan art]]ists have played a key role in the cultural life of Tibet. From designs for painted furniture to elaborate murals in religious buildings, their efforts have permeated virtually every facet of life on the [[Tibetan plateau]]. The vast majority of surviving artworks created before the mid-20th century are dedicated to the depiction of religious subjects, with the main forms being [[thangka]], [[distemper (paint)|distemper]] paintings on cloth, [[Tibetan Buddhist wall paintings]], and small statues in bronze, or large ones in clay, [[stucco]] or wood. They were commissioned by religious establishments or by pious individuals for use within the practice of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] and were manufactured in large workshops by monks and lay artists, who are mostly unknown.\n\nThe art of Tibet may be studied in terms of influences which have contributed to it over the centuries, from other [[Chinese art|Chinese]], [[Newa art|Nepalese]], [[Indian art|Indian]], and [[sacred art|sacred]] styles. Many bronzes in Tibet that suggest [[Pala Empire|Pala]] influence, are thought to have been either crafted by Indian sculptors or brought from India.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://himalayanbuddhistart.wordpress.com/2016/10/16/pala-india-maitreya-standing/ |title=Pala India, Maitreya \u2013 standing |date=October 16, 2016 |access-date=29 September 2018 |work=Himalayanbuddhistart |publisher=[[WordPress.com]]}}</ref>\n\n[[Bhutanese art]] is similar to the [[art of Tibet]]. Both are based upon [[Vajrayana|Vajrayana Buddhism]], with its pantheon of divine beings. The major orders of Buddhism in Bhutan are [[Drukpa Lineage|Drukpa Kagyu]] and [[Nyingma]]. The former is a branch of the [[Kagyu|Kagyu School]] and is known for paintings documenting the lineage of Buddhist masters and the 70 [[Je Khenpo]] (leaders of the Bhutanese monastic establishment). The Nyingma order is known for images of [[Padmasambhava]], who is credited with introducing Buddhism into Bhutan in the 7th century. According to legend, Padmasambhava hid sacred treasures for future Buddhist masters, especially [[Pema Lingpa]], to find. The [[Terton|treasure finders]] ([[Terton|''tert\u00f6n'']]) are also frequent subjects of Nyingma art.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nMET DP251650.jpg|Figurine; 14th\u201315th century; gilt-copper alloy; height: 13.5&nbsp;cm, width: 9.8&nbsp;cm; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\nAltar-piece from Nepal BM OA1927.6-13.1.jpg|Altar; 1700\u20131899; metal, stones and filigree; length: 130.7&nbsp;cm; [[British Museum]] (London)\nTibet, 18th century - Gorget - 1915.336 - Cleveland Museum of Art.jpg|Gorget; 18th century; silver; overall: 8.9&nbsp;cm, chain: 13.7&nbsp;cm; from Tibet; [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] ([[Cleveland]], US)\nMedicine Buddha painted mandala with goddess Prajnaparamita in center, 19th century, Rubin.jpg|Painted medicine Buddha [[mandala]] with goddess [[Prajnaparamita]] in center; 19th century; [[Rubin Museum of Art]] (New York City)\n</gallery>\n\n===Chinese===\n{{main|Chinese art}}\n{{see also|Chinese influences on Islamic pottery|Chinese Buddhist sculpture}}\n[[File:Ch'ien Hs\u00fcan 001.jpg|thumb|250px|''[[Wang Xizhi]] watching geese''; by [[Qian Xuan]]; 1235-before 1307; handscroll (ink, color and gold on paper); [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)]]\nIn Eastern Asia, painting was derived from the practice of calligraphy, and portraits and landscapes were painted on silk cloth. Most of the paintings represent landscapes or portraits. The most spectacular sculptures are the [[Chinese ritual bronzes|ritual bronzes]] and the bronze sculptures from [[Sanxingdui]]. A very well-known example of Chinese art is the ''[[Terracotta Army]]'', depicting the armies of [[Qin Shi Huang]], the first Emperor of China. It is a form of [[funerary art]] buried with the emperor in 210\u2013209 BC whose purpose was to protect the emperor in his afterlife.\n\nChinese art is one of the oldest continuous traditional arts in the world, and is marked by an unusual degree of continuity within, and consciousness of, that tradition, lacking an equivalent to the Western collapse and gradual recovery of classical styles. The media that have usually been classified in the West since the [[Renaissance]] as the [[decorative arts]] are extremely important in Chinese art, and much of the finest work was produced in large workshops or factories by essentially unknown artists, especially in [[Chinese ceramics]]. The range and quality of goods that decorated Chinese palaces and households, and their inhabitants, is dazzling. Materials came from across China and far beyond: gold and silver, [[mother of pearl]], ivory and rhinoceros horn, wood and [[lacquer]], [[jade]] and [[soap stone]], silk and paper.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nChang Xin Gong Deng, Han Dynasty,China (Hebei Museum).jpg|Changxin Palace lamp; circa 172 BC; bronze and gold; height: 48&nbsp;cm; [[Hebei Provincial Museum]] (China)\nWei Votivstele Museum Rietberg RCH 113.jpg|Votive stele with [[Buddha Shakyamuni]]; dated 542 ([[Eastern Wei Dynasty]]); limestone; [[Museum Rietberg]] ([[Z\u00fcrich]], Switzerland)\nChinese statuettes dancers-Ethno BHM 1946.261.1880-P6141157.jpg|Statuettes of dancers; 8th century ([[Tang Empire]]); ceramic; [[Historical Museum of Bern]] (Switzerland)\nCovered box with pavilion and figures, China, Yuan dynasty, 1300s AD, carved lacquer - Tokyo National Museum - Tokyo, Japan - DSC08285.jpg|Covered box with pavilion and figures; 1300s (the [[Yuan dynasty]]); carved lacquer; [[Tokyo National Museum]] (Tokyo)\nThe David Vases.jpg|The [[David Vases]]; 1351 (the Yuan dynasty); porcelain, cobalt blue decor under glaze; height: 63.8&nbsp;cm; [[British Museum]] (London)\nTwo flasks with dragons.jpg|Two flasks with dragons; 1403\u20131424; underglaze blue porcelain; height (the left one): 47.8&nbsp;cm, height (the right one): 44.6&nbsp;cm; British Museum\nMing Pilgerflasche Museum Rietberg U 138.jpg|Pilgrim flask decorated with peaches and pomegrenates, made with the [[cloisonn\u00e9]] technique; 1st half of the 17th century (the [[Ming Dynasty]]); Museum Rietberg\nDing Guanpeng - Peaceful Start for the New Year.jpg|''Peaceful Start for the New Year''; by [[Ding Guanpeng]]; 1748; ink and color on paper; height: 179.3&nbsp;cm; [[National Palace Museum]] ([[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]])\n</gallery>\n\n===Japanese===\n{{main|Japanese art}}\n[[File:Tosa Mitsuoki - Flowering Cherry and Autumn Maples with Poem Slips - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|450px|Flowering cherry and autumn maples with poem slips; by [[Tosa Mitsuoki]]; 1654\u20131681; pair of six-panel screens: ink, color, gold and silver on silk; height: 144 cm, width: 286 cm; [[Art Institute of Chicago]] ([[Chicago]], US)]]\n\n[[Japanese art]] covers a wide range of art styles and media, including [[J\u014dmon pottery|ancient pottery]], [[Japanese sculpture|sculpture]], [[Ink wash painting|ink painting]] and [[Japanese calligraphy|calligraphy]] on silk and paper, ''[[ukiyo-e]]'' paintings and [[woodblock printing|woodblock prints]], ceramics, [[origami]], and more recently [[manga]]\u2014modern Japanese [[cartoon]]ing and comics\u2014along with a myriad of other types.\n\nThe first settlers of Japan, the [[J\u014dmon]] people (c. 11,000\u2013300 BC). They crafted [[Jomon pottery|lavishly decorated pottery storage vessels]], clay figurines called ''[[dog\u016b]]''. Japan has been subject to sudden invasions of new ideas followed by long periods of minimal contact with the outside world. Over time the Japanese developed the ability to absorb, imitate, and finally assimilate those elements of foreign culture that complemented their aesthetic preferences. The earliest complex art in Japan was produced in the 7th and 8th centuries in connection with [[Buddhism]]. In the 9th century, as the Japanese began to turn away from China and develop indigenous forms of expression, the secular arts became increasingly important; until the late 15th century, both religious and secular arts flourished. After the [[\u014cnin War]] (1467\u20131477), Japan entered a period of political, social, and economic disruption that lasted for over a century. In the state that emerged under the leadership of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], organized religion played a much less important role in people's lives, and the arts that survived were primarily secular.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nFudo Myoo Museum Rietberg RJP 21.jpg|Fudo Myoo (Acala), king of mystical knowledge; late 12th century (Fujiwara period); cypress wood with remains of colored frame; [[Museum Rietberg]] ([[Z\u00fcrich]], Switzerland)\n\nJapan, Edo Period - Incense Guessing Game - 1921.405 - Cleveland Museum of Art.tif|Incense guessing game; 1615\u20131868; [[lacquer]]; overall: 23 x 25.4 x 16.6 cm; [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] ([[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], US)\n\nJapan, Kyoto, early 18th century - Noh Robe - 1916.1318 - Cleveland Museum of Art.tif|Robe; early 1700s; silk and brocaded metal thread; overall: 139.7 x 133.3 cm; Cleveland Museum of Art\n\nJapan, Okinawa Prefecture, Ryukyu Islands, Edo Period - Tiered Food Box with Stand - 1989.5 - Cleveland Museum of Art.tif|Tiered food Box with stand; late 18th century; red lacquer over a wood core, with litharge painting and engraved gold designs; overall: 53 x 68 cm; Cleveland Museum of Art\n\nKitagawa Utamaro - Toji san bijin (Three Beauties of the Present Day)From Bijin-ga (Pictures of Beautiful Women), published by Tsutaya Juzaburo - Google Art Project.jpg|''[[Three Beauties of the Present Day]]''; by [[Kitagawa Utamaro]]; circa 1793; height: 3.87&nbsp;cm (15.23&nbsp;in), width: 2.62&nbsp;cm (10.31&nbsp;in); [[Toledo Museum of Art]] ([[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]], [[Ohio]], US)\n\nFile:Japan, 19th century - Plate (Imari ware?) - 1991.1050 - Cleveland Museum of Art.tif|Plate; 1800s; overglaze enameled porcelain; diameter: 48.3 cm, overall: 5.7 cm; Cleveland Museum of Art\n\nInro-BHM 1079-P8260170.JPG|[[Inr\u014d]]; 19th century; wood, lacquer and gold; [[Historical Museum of Bern]] (Switzerland)\n\nMET 2015 300 189 F Burke.jpg|Painted folding fan; by [[Yamamoto Baiitsu]]; 1832; ink and color on paper; Image:17 \u00d7 47.5 cm; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\n</gallery>\n\n=== Korean ===\n{{main|Korean art}}\n\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align =\n| total_width = 500\n| direction = horizontal\n| footer = Royal [[seal (emblem)|seal]] with knob in the form of a turtle; late 16th\u201317th century; cast bronze with gilding; 6.98 x 15.24 x 15.24 cm; [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] ([[Los Angeles]], US)\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1 = Royal Seal with Knob in the Form of a Turtle LACMA M.2000.15.187 (1 of 6).jpg\n| width1 =\n| height1 =\n| alt1 =\n| caption1 = Front\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2 = Royal Seal with Knob in the Form of a Turtle LACMA M.2000.15.187 (3 of 6).jpg\n| width2 =\n| height2 =\n| alt2 =\n| caption2 = Inscription\n}}\n[[Korean art]]s include traditions in <!--(alphabetical:)-->calligraphy, music, painting and pottery, often marked by the use of natural forms, surface decoration and bold colors or sounds.\n\nThe earliest examples of Korean art consist of [[stone age]] works dating from 3000 BC. These mainly consist of [[votive offering|votive sculptures]] and more recently, [[petroglyph]]s, which were rediscovered. This early period was followed by the art styles of various Korean kingdoms and dynasties. Korean artists sometimes modified [[Chinese art|Chinese traditions]] with a native preference for simple elegance, spontaneity, and an appreciation for purity of nature.\n\nThe [[Goryeo]] Dynasty (918\u20131392) was one of the most prolific periods for a wide range of disciplines, especially pottery. The Korean art market is concentrated in the [[Insadong]] district of [[Seoul]] where over 50 small galleries exhibit and occasional fine arts auctions. Galleries are cooperatively run, small and often with curated and finely designed exhibits. In every town there are smaller regional galleries, with local artists showing in traditional and contemporary media. Art galleries usually have a mix of media. Attempts at bringing Western conceptual art into the foreground have usually had their best success outside of Korea in New York, San Francisco, London and Paris.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nPensive Bodhisattva (National Treasure No. 78) 01.jpg|Statue of Maitreya in meditation; 6th-7th century; gilt bronze; height: 83.2&nbsp;cm; [[National Museum of Korea]] ([[Seoul]])\n\uc218\uc6d4\uad00\uc74c\ub3c4 \uace0\ub824-\u6c34\u6708\u89c0\u97f3\u5716 \u9ad8\u9e97-Water-moon Avalokiteshvara MET h1 14.76.6.jpg|Water-moon Kwanseum\u01d4m; early 14th century; hanging scroll, ink and colours on silk; 1.14 x 0.55 m; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\nBottle with Cranes and Clouds, Joseon dynasty (1392-1910), 18th century.jpg|Bottle with cranes and clouds; 18th century; porcelain; 26.35 x 17.15 cm; [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] ([[Los Angeles]], US)\nBuddha Seokgamoni (Shakyamuni) Preaching to the Assembly on Vulture Peak LACMA AC1998.268.1 (1 of 11).jpg|Buddha Seokgamoni (Shakyamuni) preaching to the assembly on vulture peak; 1755; unmounted, ink and color on silk; approximatively 335.28 x 406.4 cm; Los Angeles County Museum of Art\n</gallery>\n\n=== South-east Asian ===\n{{Further|Vietnamese art|Thai art|Cambodian art|Khmer sculpture|Indonesian art}}\n{{see also|Khmer shadow theatre}}\n[[File:Kinnara Relief, Prambanan 1083.jpg|300px|thumb|[[Prambanan]] panel; early 9th century; volcanic stone; height: circa 23 cm.

Here live populations of widely diverse ethnic origins, speaking hundreds of different languages and existing at different stages of cultural evolution. With only a few exceptions, these peoples have been subjected in the course of their long histories to outside cultural influences of varying intensity from the [[Islamic world]], [[China]] and the West, as well as from India. Much of South-east Asian art is religious in nature. The penetration of Hindu and Buddhist influences from India has been especially profound in the mainland countries of [[Burma]], [[Thailand]], [[Cambodia]] and [[Laos]]. Chinese influences has been more limited, except [[Vietnam]], which was under Chinese hegemony from the 2nd century BC to the tenth century AD.\n\nEarly South-east Asian rulers built state temples to establish their legitimacy and give material expression to their power and authority. These were often decorated with relief sculptures of great vitality and originality, which nevertheless always conformed to established iconographic conventions for the depiction of Hindu and Buddhist themes.\n\nSouth-east Asian artists have long excelled at fresco painting and painting on lacquer, particularly in the Buddhist countries of the mainland and in Hindu [[Bali]]. Frescos and generally painted on the inner walls of the galleries surrounding temple enclosures, while painted lacquer is mainly applied to wooden objects: panels, cabinets, chests, doors and shutters. The subject matter of both forms of painting in generally confined to depictions of Hindu deities; stories from the Hindu epics, the ''[[Ramayana]]'' and the ''[[Mahabharata]]''; episodes from the life of the historical [[Buddha]] and tales of his previous lives (''[[jatakas]]''); and other Hindu and Buddhist themes.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nMET DP366477.jpg|Figurine; from Java (Indonesia); 9th century; bronze; height: 11.4&nbsp;cm; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\n\nVietnam Sitzende Gottheit Museum Rietberg RHI 402.jpg|Seated deity; late 9th; [[sandstone]]; from [[Champa]] ([[Quang Nam Province]], Temple Complex of Dong-du'o'ng); [[Rietberg Museum]] ([[Z\u00fcrich]], [[Switzerland]])\n\nFronton Cambodge Mus\u00e9e Guimet 9971.jpg|Tollitama pediment; from Cambodia; 976; pink sandstone; 196 x 269&nbsp;cm; [[Mus\u00e9e Guimet]] (Paris)\n\nSiva statue My Son.JPG|[[Shiva]] statue; 10-12th centuries; [[sandstone]]; height: 150 cm; Guimet Museum<ref>{{cite book|last1=Catherine Noppe|first1=Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Hubert|title=Art of Vietnam|date=|publisher=Parkstone Press Ldt|isbn=1 85995 860 5|page=106|url=|language=en}}</ref>\n\nPhra Malai Manuscript LACMA M.76.93.2 (20 of 21).jpg|A page of the [[Phra Malai|Phra Malai Manuscript]]; opaque watercolor and ink on paper; covers: gilded and lacquered paper; c. 1860\u20131880; 13.97 x 68.26 x 6.35&nbsp;cm; [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] (US)\n\nKain sarong prada from Indonesia, Peranakan, Honolulu Museum of Art 10480.1.JPG|Kain sarong prada (ceremonial skirt cloth); from Indramaya (Java, Indonesia); late 19th century; cotton, [[gold leaf]], plain weave, batik (resist dyed); [[Honolulu Museum of Art]] ([[Hawaii]], US)\n\nJava Maske Prabu Dewakusuma Museum Rietberg RIN 202.jpg|Mask of Prabu Dewakusuma, prince of Jenggala; circa 1890; painted wood; from eastern Java; Museum Rietberg\n\nBercerita dengan Wayang.jpg|[[Wayang]] Kulit, also known as Wajang Koelit, is a form of puppet theatre art found in Java, Indonesia and other parts of South-east Asia\n</gallery>\n\n==Africa==\n{{main|African art}}\n{{Further|Igbo art|Yoruba art|Benin art|Kuba art|Luba art}}\nAfrican art includes both [[African sculpture|sculpture]], typified by the brass castings of the [[Benin art|Benin people]], as well as [[African folk art|folk art]]. Concurrent with the European Middle Ages, in the eleventh century AD a nation that made grand architecture, gold sculpture, and intricate jewelry was founded in [[Great Zimbabwe]]. Impressive sculpture was concurrently being cast from brass by the [[Yoruba art|Yoruba people]] of what is now Nigeria. Such a culture grew and was ultimately transformed to become the [[Benin art|Benin Kingdom]], where elegant altar tusks, brass heads, plaques of brass, and palatial architecture was created. The Benin Kingdom was ended by the British in 1897, and little of the culture's art now remains in Nigeria. Today, the most significant arts venue in Africa is the [[Johannesburg Biennale]].\n\nSub-Saharan Africa is characterized by a high density of cultures. Notable are the, [[Dogon people]] from [[Mali]]; [[Edo people|Edo]], [[yoruba people|Yoruba]], [[Igbo people|Igbo]] people and the [[Nok civilization]] from [[Nigeria]]; [[Kuba Kingdom|Kuba]] and [[Luba people]] from [[Central Africa]]; [[Ashanti people]] from [[Ghana]]; [[Zulu people]] from [[Southern Africa]]; and [[Fang people]] from [[Equatorial Guinea]] (85%), Cameroon and Gabon; the [[Sao civilization]] people from Chad; [[Kwele people]] from eastern Gabon, [[Republic of the Congo]] and Cameroon.\n\nThe myriad forms of African art are components of some of the most vibrant and responsive artistic traditions in the world and are integral to the lives of African people. Created for specific purposes, artworks can reveal their ongoing importance through physical transformations that enhance both their appearance and their potency. Many traditional African art forms are created as conduits to the spirit world and change appearance as materials are added to enhance their beauty and potency. The more a work is used and blessed, the more abstract it becomes with the accretion of sacrificial matter and the wearing down of original details.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nNok sculpture Louvre 70-1998-11-1.jpg|Seated figure; by [[Nok culture]]; 5th century BC-5th century AD; terracotta; height: 38&nbsp;cm; [[Mus\u00e9e du quai Branly]] (Paris)\nPlaque- Warrior and Attendants MET DT1231.jpg|Plaque with warriors and attendants; from the [[Kingdom of Benin]]; 16th\u201317th century; brass; height: 47.6&nbsp;cm; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]\nClevelandart 1983.33.jpg|Prestige chair; by [[Babanki people]]; circa 1800; wood: overall: 80.7 x 53.3 x 44.5&nbsp;cm; [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] ([[Ohio]], US)\nAppuie-t\u00eate Luba-RDC.jpg|Headrest; by [[Luba people]]; 19th century; wood; height: 18.5&nbsp;cm (7.2&nbsp;in), width: 19&nbsp;cm (7.4&nbsp;in), thickness: 8&nbsp;cm (3.1&nbsp;in); Mus\u00e9e du quai Branly\nFang Ngil Berlin IIIC6000.jpg|Mask; by [[Fang people]]; circa 1895; wood coloured with [[kaolin]]; height: 78&nbsp;cm; [[Ethnological Museum of Berlin]] (Germany)\nMasque Kwele.

One approach treats the area thematically, with foci on [[ancestry]], warfare, the body, gender, trade, religion, and [[tourism]]. Unfortunately, little ancient art survives from Oceania. Scholars believe that this is likely because artists used perishable materials, such as wood and feathers, which did not survive in the tropical climate, and there are no historical records to refer to most of this material. The understanding of Oceania's artistic cultures thus begins with the documentation of it by Westerners, such as Captain [[James Cook]], in the eighteenth century. At the turn of the twentieth century the French artist [[Paul Gauguin]] spent significant amounts of time in Tahiti, living with local people and making modern art \u2014 a fact that has become intertwined with Tahitian visual culture to the present day.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} The indigenous [[Australian art|art of Australia]] often looks like abstract modern art, but it has deep roots in local culture.\n\nThe art of [[Oceania]] is the last great tradition of art to be appreciated by the world at large. Despite being one of the longest continuous traditions of art in the world, dating back at least fifty millennia, it remained relatively unknown until the second half of the 20th century.\n\nThe often ephemeral materials of Aboriginal art of Australia makes it difficult to determine the antiquity of the majority of the forms of art practised today. The most durable forms are the multitudes of rock engravings and rock paintings which are found across the continent. In the Arnhem Land escarpment, evidence suggests that paintings were being made fifty thousand years ago, antedating the Palaeolithic rock paintings of [[Cave of Altamira|Altamira]] & [[Lascaux]] in Europe.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nFigure MET DT1276.jpg|Head; 9th\u201311th century; vesicular [[basalt]]; height: 19.7&nbsp;cm, width: 15.5&nbsp;cm; from [[Hawaii]]; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\nMoai Rano raraku.jpg|''[[Moai]]''s at [[Rano Raraku]] (the [[Easter Island]]).

Many [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] states in Eastern Europe, as well as to some degree the [[Muslim world|Muslim]] states of the eastern [[Mediterranean]], preserved many aspects of the empire's culture and art for centuries afterward.\n\n[[Icon]]s (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u03b5\u1f30\u03ba\u03ce\u03bd}} ''eik\u014dn'' \"image\", \"resemblance\") are the most important visual elements in Byzantine religious practice, central to Orthodox worship since the end of [[Iconoclasm]] in the ninth century. Consistent in their format in order to preserve a sense of portraiture and the familiarity of favoured images, they have nevertheless transformed over time. An unusual characteristic of Byzantine art are the golden backgronds. Clear glass was often backed with [[gold leaf]]s to create a rich, shimmering effect.\n\nCarried by patriarchs in Eastern processions, read by monks in secluded caves and held by emperors at important ceremonies, sacred books, often beautifully illustrated, were central to Byzantine belief and ritual. Few manuscripts seem to have been produced in the Early Byzantine period between the sixth and eighth centuries CE, but there was a flourishing of painted books in the ninth century, following the end of Iconoclasm.\n\nJewelry, worn by men, women and children, was a clear indication of rank and wealth in Byzantine society. Styles varied from bold, heavy goldwork with striking large cabochon stones to extraordinarily delicate gold filigree and granulation. Ornament ranged from decorative patterning to floral and animal motifs to complex Christian iconography. Often jewellery was attached to ceremonial dress that did not often require cleaning. A popular technique from the 3rd to 7th centuries was ''opus interrasile'' or ''diatrita'', in which fine thin sheets of gold were pierced, creating a lace-like effect that is both beautiful and economical, as it reduces the weight of gold used. By the 5th century, stimulated by trade with the East, colored precious and semi-precious stones, polished rather than cut, were incorporated. Decorative designs were picked out in gold priced work, highlighted in dark [[niello]] (a silver sulphide that contrasted to gold and silver) or, from the 9th century, depicted in [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fortenberry|first1=Diane|title=The Art Museum |date=2017|publisher=Phaidon|isbn=978 0 7148 7502 6|page=115|url=|language=en}}</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nMarble slap with relief representation of the Nativity.

It emerged some decades into their rule and persisted past the Ottonian emperors into the reigns of the early [[Salian dynasty]], which lacks an artistic \"style label\" of its own.<ref name=\"Suckale-Redlefsen, 524\">Suckale-Redlefsen, 524</ref>  In the traditional scheme of art history, Ottonian art follows [[Carolingian art]] and precedes [[Romanesque art]], though the transitions at both ends of the period are gradual rather than sudden.  Like the former and unlike the latter, it was very largely a style restricted to a few of the small cities of the period, and important [[monastery|monasteries]], as well as the court circles of the emperor and his leading [[vassal]]s.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nClevelandart 1930.741.jpg|Book-shaped reliquary; circa 1000; ivory, gilded silver, pearls, rubies, emeralds, crystals, onyx, cornelian and oak; overall: 31.6 x 24.4 x 7.5&nbsp;cm; [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] (US)\n11th-century painters - Gospel Book of Henry II - WGA15924.jpg|Gospel Book of Henry II; circa 1020; illumination on parchment; [[Vatican Library]] (Rome)\nJuengeresMathildenkreuz.jpg|The ''[[Cross of Mathilde]]''; 11th century; oak, gold sheets, glass, bronze, enamel and other materials; height: 45&nbsp;cm, width: 30.5&nbsp;cm; [[Essen Cathedral Treasury]] (Germany)\nHildesheim-Christussaeule-Hildesia.jpg|The ''[[Bernward Column]]''; 1000\u20131200; copper alloy; height: 3.8 m; [[Hildesheim]] ([[Lower Saxony]], Germany)\n</gallery>\n\n====Viking art====\n{{main|Viking art}}\nViking art, also known commonly as Norse art, is a term widely accepted for the [[art]] of [[Scandinavia]]n [[Norsemen]] and [[Vikings|Viking]] settlements further afield\u2014particularly in the [[British Isles]] and [[Iceland]]\u2014during the [[Viking Age]] of the 8th\u201311th centuries CE.

The period saw a resurgence of monumental stone structures with complex structural programmes.\n\n[[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] churches are characterized by rigid articulation and geometric clarity, incorporated into a unified volumetric whole. The architecture is austere but enlivened by decorative sculpting of capitals and portals, as well as frescoed interiors. Geometric and foliate patterning gives way to increasingly three-dimensional figurative sculpture.\n\nFrom the mid-eleventh to the early thirteenth centuries, Romanesque paintings were two-dimensional, defined by bold, linear outlines and geometry, particularly in the handling of drapery; symmetry and frontality were emphasised. Virtually all Western churches were painted, but probably only a few wall painters were monks; instead, itinerant artists carried out most of this work. Basic blocking out was done on wet [[plaster]] with earth colours. A limited palette, dominated by white, red, yellow ochres and azure, was employed for maximum visual effect, with dense colouring forming a backdrop of bands, a practice that originated in late Classical art as an attempt to distinguish earth and sky.\n\nDuring the later eleventh and twelfth centuries, the great age of Western monasticism, Europe experienced unprecedented economic, social and political change, leading to burgeoning wealth among landowners, including monasteries. There was increasing demand for books, and economic wealth allowed many manuscripts to be richly [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminated]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nMaria Lach 02.jpg|''[[Maria Laach Abbey]]'' (near [[Andernach]], Germany), one of the most iconic Romanesque churches\nVezelay WLM2016 La basilique Sainte-Marie-Madeleine (3).jpg|Stone bas-relief of [[Jesus]], from the [[V\u00e9zelay Abbey]] ([[Burgundy]], France)\n\u00c9vangiles de Liessies - saint Jean - Avesnes-sur-Helpe.jpg|Miniature of [[Saint John the Evangelist]]; before 1147; illumination on parchment; 35.5&nbsp;cm; [[Avesnes-sur-Helpe]] (France)\nKlosterkirche M\u00fcstair Freske Steinigung Stephanus.jpg|The stoning of Saint Stephen; 1160s; fresco; height: 1.3 m; [[Saint John Abbey, M\u00fcstair|Saint John Abbey]] ([[Val M\u00fcstair]], [[Canton of Grisons]], Switzerland)\n</gallery>\n\n====Gothic====\n{{main|Gothic art}}\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | header    =\n | header_align = \n | header_background =\n | footer    = The ''[[Wilton Diptych]]''; 1395\u20131459; tempera and gold on panel; 53 x 37 cm; [[National Gallery]] (London)\n | footer_align = left/right/center\n | footer_background =\n | width     =\n | image1    = Wilton diptych; left-hand panel.jpg\n | width1    = 150\n | caption1  = \n | alt1      =\n | image2    = Wilton diptych; right-hand panel.jpg\n | width2    = 150\n | caption2  = \n | alt2      = }}\nGothic art developed in Northern France out of Romanesque in the 12th century AD, and led by the concurrent development of [[Gothic architecture]]. It spread to all of [[Western Europe]], and much of [[Southern Europe|Southern]] and [[Central Europe]], never quite effacing more classical styles in Italy.  In the late 14th century, the sophisticated court style of [[International Gothic]] developed, which continued to evolve until the late 15th century.\n\nThe imposing Gothic cathedrals, with their sculptural programmes and stained glass windows, epitomize the Gothic style.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fortenberry|first1=Diane|title=The Art Museum |date=2017|publisher=Phaidon|isbn=978 0 7148 7502 6|page=149|url=|language=en}}</ref> It differs from Romanesque through its rib-shaped [[Vault (architecture)|vaults]], and the use of [[ogive]]s.

It has experienced from time to time westernising movements that culminated in the comprehensive reforms of [[Peter the Great]] (around 1700). From prehistoric times the material of vernacular Russian architecture was wood. [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine churches]] and the [[architecture of Kievan Rus]] were characterized by broader, flatter domes without a special framework erected above the drum. In contrast to this ancient form, each drum of a Russian church is surmounted by a special structure of metal or timber, which is lined with sheet iron or tiles. Russian architecture used the dome shape not only for churches but also for other buildings. Some characteristics taken from the Slavic pagan temples are the exterior galleries and the plurality of towers.\n\nThe use and making of icons entered [[Kievan Rus']] following its conversion to Orthodox Christianity from the Eastern Roman ([[Byzantine]]) Empire in 988 CE. As a general rule, these icons strictly followed models and formulas hallowed by usage, some of which had originated in Constantinople. As time passed, the Russians\u2014notably [[Andrei Rublev]] and [[Dionisius]]\u2014widened the vocabulary of iconic types and styles far beyond anything found elsewhere. The personal, improvisatory and creative traditions of Western European religious art are largely lacking in Russia before the seventeenth century, when [[Simon Ushakov]]'s painting became strongly influenced by religious paintings and engravings from Protestant as well as Catholic Europe.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nO98 Idol von Sbrutsch mit Darstellung von Unterwelt, Erde und des Himmels, zirka 10.

It is difficult, if not futile, to identify a single impetus for the changes that took place, but a number of factors contributed: a new awareness of antiquity and its distinctiveness, economic prosperity and a coincident sense of competition among patrons and artists, and a newfound awareness of the natural and secular world.  \n\nMedieval Europeans didn't perceive a fundamental difference between their own time and antiquity. People were largely indifferent to the scattered vestiges of the past around them, for ancient monuments were familiar to the point of being invisible. Some of these were seen as `marvels\u2019 because of their size or fine carving, but that only made them suspect. The [[Pantheon]] in Rome, for example, was said to have been built by demons, and it only survived because it was converted into a church.\n\nThe renewed attention to the past as distinct from the present and, more importantly, a desire to revive it, occurred in a series of waves. In the 13th century the [[Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman]] Emperor [[Frederick II]] (reign 1220-1250), who ruled southern Italy, sought to revive the glories of imperial Rome, including its arts. The sculptor [[Nicola Pisano]] learned his craft in that environment before moving north to [[Tuscany]] and inspiring local sculptors. In the 14th century the Italian poet [[Petrarch]] (1304-1374) postulated a definitive break between the golden age of antiquity and his own time of cultural decline. In the 15th century [[Leon Battista Alberti]] (1404-1472), in his treatise ''On Painting'', wrote of the talented artists of antiquity, in comparison to whom living painters and sculptors were `in no way inferior\u2019. This sense of distance inspired Italians to view the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] past with fresh eyes, to learn from the accomplishments of the ancients. Competition was also a crucial motivator, as cities, rulers and private individuals strove to outdo one another in their patronage of public and private artworks.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Fortenberry|first1=Diane|title=THE ART MUSEUM|date=2017|publisher=Phaidon|isbn=978 0 7148 7502 6|page=156|url=|language=en}}</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nPisa, battistero di San Giovanni (45).jpg|Pulpit; by [[Nicola Pisano]]; 1265\u20131268; marble; height: 4.6 m; [[Pisa Baptistery]] (Italy)<ref>{{cite book|last1=Fortenberry|first1=Diane|title=THE ART MUSEUM|date=2017|publisher=Phaidon|isbn=978 0 7148 7502 6|page=156|url=|language=en}}</ref>\n\nView of Santa Maria del Fiore in Florence.jpg|The ''[[Florence Cathedral]]'', built between 1296 and 1436 in [[Florence]] (Italy)\n\nVan Eyck - Arnolfini Portrait.jpg|''[[Arnolfini Portrait|The Arnolfini Portrait]]''; by [[Jan van Eyck]]; 1434; oil on panel; 82.2 x 60&nbsp;cm; [[National Gallery]] (London)\n\nFra Angelico - The Last Judgement (Winged Altar) - Google Art Project.jpg|''The Last Judgement''; by [[Fra Angelico]]; 1435\u20131450; poplar wood; 103 x 65.3 cm; [[Gem\u00e4ldegalerie, Berlin|Gem\u00e4ldegalerie]] (Berlin)\n\n'David' by Michelangelo Fir JBU002.jpg|''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]''; by [[Michelangelo]]; 1501\u20131504; marble; 517&nbsp;cm \u00d7 199&nbsp;cm; [[Galleria dell'Accademia]] (Florence)\n\nMona Lisa, by Leonardo da Vinci, from C2RMF retouched.jpg|''[[Mona Lisa]]''; by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]; c. 1503\u20131506, perhaps continuing until c. 1517; oil on poplar panel; 77&nbsp;cm \u00d7 53&nbsp;cm; [[Louvre]]\n\nThe Garden of Earthly Delights by Bosch High Resolution.jpg|''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]''; by [[Hieronymus Bosch]]; c. 1504; oil on panel; 2.2 x 1.95 m (7&nbsp;ft 2{{fraction|1|2}} in.) \u2013 central panel; [[Museo del Prado]] ([[Madrid]], Spain)\n\n\"The School of Athens\" by Raffaello Sanzio da Urbino.jpg|''[[The School of Athens]]''; by [[Raphael]]; 1509\u20131510; fresco; 5.8 x 8.2 m; [[Apostolic Palace]] ([[Vatican City]])\n\nBasin or bowl with Laura Bella MET DP326519.jpg|Basin or bowl with a lady named Laura Bella; circa 1510; maiolica (tin-glazed earthenware); overall: 6 \u00d7 27.3 cm; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\n\nThe Rhinoceros (NGA 1964.8.697) enhanced.png|''[[D\u00fcrer's Rhinoceros|The Rhinoceros]]''; by [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]]; 1515; woodcut; 23.5 cm \u00d7 29.8 cm; [[National Gallery of Art]] ([[Washington, D.C.]])\n\nAltar enframement MET DP271811.jpg|Italian altar enframement; circa 1530\u20131550; marble; height: 4.2 m, width: 3.3 m; probably from [[Tuscany]]; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nHans Holbein the Younger - The Ambassadors - Google Art Project.jpg|''[[The Ambassadors (Holbein)|The Ambassadors]]''; by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]]; 1533; oil on panel; 2.07 x 2.09; [[National Gallery]] (London)\n\nPharmacy bottle (one of a pair) MET DP320576.jpg|Pair of pharmacy bottles; circa 1550; maiolica (tin-glazed earthenware); overall: 38.4 \u00d7 24.9 \u00d7 21 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nCassone (chest), pair with 1975.1.1947 MET SLP1940-1.jpg|Cassone (chest); mid 16th century; walnut, carved and partially gilded, coniferous wood; height: 73.6 cm, width: 1.7 m, depth: 63.5 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nOval basin or dish with subject from Amadis of Gaul MET DP320592.jpg|Oval basin or dish with subject from Amadis of Gaul; circa 1559\u20131564; maiolica; overall: 6 \u00d7 67.3 \u00d7 52.4 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nBowl with Allegory of Peace MET DP316534.jpg|Bowl with an allegory of peace; 1561; maiolica; overall: 12.1 \u00d7 36.5 cm; circa Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nGiuseppe Arcimboldo - Summer - Google Art Project.jpg|''Summer''; by [[Giuseppe Arcimboldo]]; 1563; oil on panel; 67 x 50.8&nbsp;cm; [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] ([[Vienna]], Austria)\n\nPieter Bruegel the Elder - The Tower of Babel (Vienna) - Google Art Project.jpg|''[[The Tower of Babel (Bruegel)|The Tower of Babel]]''; by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]]; 1563; oil on panel: 1.14 x 1.55 cm; Kunsthistorisches Museum\n\nDresser (Dressoir aux harpies) MET DP105799.jpg|French dresser (dressoir aux harpies); circa 1570\u20131590; carved walnut with interior elements of oak, pine, and some iron accessories; height: 144.8 cm, width: 137.8 cm, depth: 50.8 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nInkstand with Apollo and the Muses MET DP320047.jpg|Inkstand with [[Apollo]] and the [[Muses]]; 1584; maiolica (tin-glazed earthenware); overall: 48.3 \u00d7 52.1 \u00d7 37.8 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n</gallery>\n\n===Baroque===\n{{main|Baroque}}\n{{Listen|type=music|filename=W.

The 17th century was a period of volatile change. Astronomical breakthroughs and scientific inventions such as the telescope and microscope were matched by developments in geography, exploration, natural history and philosophy. Religious upheaval added to the mix, as the Catholic Counter-Reformation contested the growing popularity of Protestant faith. During the Renaissance and Baroque eras, the highest goal of painting was to provide moral exemplars by depicting instructive events from literature, history and mythology. These works are known as history paintings. 17th century history painters were preoccupied with rendering emotion at the most significant moment of a story. This process involved the use of gesture and facial expressions to convey the `passion of the soul\u2019. This was often cimbined with a concern for narrative clarity and dramatic concentration, especially in the case of [[Nicolas Poussin]]. By such means painters intensified the dramatic impact of narrative scenes, as in Poussin's ''Abduction of the Sabine Women'', in which the horror and fear displayed by the women in contrasted with the aggression and determination of the men, resulting in images of power and terrible beauty.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Fortenberry|first1=Diane|title=THE ART MUSEUM|date=2017|publisher=Phaidon|isbn=978 0 7148 7502 6|page=243|url=|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn decorative and [[applied arts]], Baroque appeared first in the area of present-day [[Italy]], and spread in all Europe.

Frivolity was a virtue, and portrait painting was increasingly in demand in a society in which a charming likeness was an essential part of seduction. French Rococo developed during the [[R\u00e9gence]] (1715-1723), when [[Louis XV]] (reign between 1715 and 1774) was a child and the country was governed by [[Philippe d'Orl\u00e9ans]]. It grew out of the heavier Baroque style of the court of [[Louis XIV]], incorporating lighter elements, more delicate curves, asymmetry and playfulness.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fortenberry|first1=Diane|title=THE ART MUSEUM |date=2017|publisher=Phaidon|isbn=978 0 7148 7502 6|page=265|url=|language=en}}</ref> In decorative arts and architecture, it can be recognised by its huge quantity of curves and [[C]]-shaped [[volute]]s, lightness in colour and weight, or low relief work of ribbons, scrolls, shells, flower wreaths, birds and animals.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mattinson|first1=Lindsay|title=Understanding Architecture A Guide To Architectural Styles|date=2019|publisher=Amber Books|isbn=978-1-78274-748-2|page=95|url=|language=en}}</ref> In [[France]], it enters through the style known as [[Louis Quinze]], here being also known as Pompadour.

The house is one of the most beautiful 18th-century city mansions in Paris. It was built for the Prince and Princess of Soubise in 1375 and remodelled in 1704 under the instructions of [[Fran\u00e7ois, Prince of Soubise|Fran\u00e7ois de Rohan]], Prince de Soubise. The building, which is divided into two apartments - that of the Prince on the ground floor and that of the Princess on the upper floor, or ''piano nobile'' - features on both floors oval salons that overlook the garden. the salons were created between 1735 and 1739 by [[Germain Boffrand]], a pupil of the French architect [[Fran\u00e7ois Mansart]]. Boffrand softened the lines of the Salon Oval de la Princesse with sinuous curves, multiplying the mirror reflection. The walls melt into the vaults, and irregular niches for sculpture are separated by ''[[rocaille]]'' shells. Architecture, sculpture and painting combine to create a rich and harmonious atmosphere. Eight ceiling canvases painted by [[Charles-Joseph Natoire]] between 1737 and 1739 illustrate the story of [[Cupid and Psyche]]. Before his return from Italy in 1730, Natoire had spent several years in Rome at the Acad\u00e9mie de France, where he had studied the works of [[Paolo Veronese]], [[Antonio Correggio]] and, especially, [[Pietro da Cortona]], a 17th-century painted of decorative frescos. Their influence is evident in the supple and elegant compositions, the lighting effects, and the way the figures are adapted to the constraints of the decor. The palette of pinks, blues and greens creates a charming arcadian effect, encapsulating the mature Rococo.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fortenberry|first1=Diane|title=THE ART MUSEUM |date=2017|publisher=Phaidon|isbn=978 0 7148 7502 6|page=267|url=|language=en}}</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nStift Wilhering Kirche Orgel 01.jpg|The amazing interior of the [[Wilhering Abbey]] ([[Wilhering]], [[Austria]]).

People, commodities, ideas, and information could travel between countries and continents with unprecedented speed and these changes were reflected in the arts. The invention of photography in the 1830s further altered certain aspects of art, particularly painting. By the dawn of the 19th century, a long and gradual paradigm shift was complete, from the Gothic when artists were viewed as craftsmen in the service of the church and monarchies, to the idea of art for art's sake, where the ideas and visions of the individual artist were held in the high regard, with patronage from an increasingly literate, affluent, and urban middle and upper class population that had been emerging for 200 years (particularly in Paris and London). A dichotomy begin in the late 18th century between neoclassicism and romanticism that subdivided and continued to run through virtually every new movement in modern art: \"Spreading like waves, these \"isms\" defy national, ethnic, and chronological boundaries; never dominant anywhere for long, they compete or merge with each other in endlessly shifting patterns. \"<ref name=\"Janson (1977)\">Janson, H.

One of the earliest expressions of  romanticism was in the [[English landscape garden]], carefully designed to appear natural and standing in dramatic contrast to the formal gardens of the time. The concept of the \"natural\" English garden was adopted throughout Europe and America in the following decades. In architecture, the romantics frequently turned to alternative sources other than the Greek and Roman examples admired by the neo-classicist. Romantic architecture often revived [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] forms and other styles such as exotic eastern models.

In nineteenth-century painting, the term Realism refers more to the subject matter depicted than to the style or technique. Realist paintings typically represent ordinary places and people engaged in everyday activities, as opposed to grand, idealized landscapes, mythological gods, biblical subjects, and historical figures and events that had often dominated painting in western culture. Courbet said \"I cannot paint an angel because I have never seen one\".<ref name=\"Janson (1977)\" /> Realism was also in part a reaction to the often dramatic, exotic, and emotionally charged work of romanticism. The term realism is applied relative to the idealized imagery of neo-classicism and the romanticized imagery of romanticism. Artists such as [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]] and [[Honor\u00e9 Daumier]] had loose associations with realism, as did members of the [[Barbizon School]], particularly [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet]], but it was perhaps [[Gustave Courbet]] who was the central figure in the movement, self identifying as a realist, advocating realism, and influencing younger artists such as [[\u00c9douard Manet]]. One significant aspect of realism was the practice of painting landscapes [[en plein air]] and its subsequent influence on [[impressionism]]. Beyond France, realism is exemplified by artists such as [[Wilhelm Leibl]] in Germany, [[Ford Madox Brown]] in England, and [[Winslow Homer]] in the United States. Art historian [[H. Harvard Arnason|H. H. Arnason]] wrote, \"The chronological sequence of neo-classicism, romanticism, and realism is, of course, only a convenient stratification of movements or tendencies so inextricably bound up with one another and with the preceding movements that it is impossible to tell where one ended and another began\",<ref name=\"Arnason (1977)\" /> and this becomes even more pertinent and complex as one follows all of the movements and \"isms\" into the late 19th and early 20th centuries.<ref name=\"Leymarie, Jean (1962)\">Leymarie, Jean (1962) French Painting, the Nineteenth Century.

C. (USA)]]Impressionism emerged in France, under the influences of [[Realism (art movement)|Realism]], the [[Barbizon School]], and [[en plein air]] painters like [[Eug\u00e8ne Boudin]], [[Camille Corot]], [[Charles-Fran\u00e7ois Daubigny|Charles- Francois Daubigny]], and [[Johan Barthold Jongkind]]. Starting in the late 1850s, several of the impressionists had made acquaintances and friendships as students in Paris, notably at the free [[Acad\u00e9mie Suisse]] and [[Charles Gleyre|Charles Gleyre's]] studio. Their progressive work was frequently rejected by the conservative juries of the prestigious [[Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts|Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux Arts]] salons, a forum where many artist turned to establish their reputations, and many of the young artist were included in a highly publicized, but much ridiculed [[Salon des Refus\u00e9s]] in 1863. In 1874 they formed the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme Coop\u00e9rative des Artistes Peintres, Sculpteurs, Graveurs, independent of the academy, and mounted the first of several impressionist exhibitions in Paris, through to 1886 when their eighth and final exhibition was held. Important figures in the movement included [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bazille]], [[Gustave Caillebotte]], [[Mary Cassatt]], [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]], [[Edgar Degas]], [[Armand Guillaumin]], [[\u00c9douard Manet]], [[Claude Monet]], [[Berthe Morisot]], [[Camille Pissarro]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], and [[Alfred Sisley]]. Although impressionism was primarily a movement of painters, Degas and Renoir also produced sculptures and others like [[Auguste Rodin]] and [[Medardo Rosso]] are sometimes linked to impressionism. By 1885 impressionism had achieved some prominence, and yet a younger generation were already pushing the limits beyond impressionism. Artist from [[Museum of Russian impressionism|Russia]], [[Heidelberg School|Australia]], [[American Impressionism|America]] and Latin America soon adopted impressionist styles. A few of the original impressionist continued producing significant work into the 1910s and 1920s.<ref name=\"Blunden & Blunden (1976)\">Blunden, Maria and Godfrey Blunden (1976) Impressionists and Impressionism.

Paintings were often completed in hours or days with wet paint applied to wet paint (opposed to wet on dry paint, completed in weeks and months). Rather than applying glazes and mixed colors, pure colors were often applied side by side, in thick, opaque, [[impasto]] strokes; blending in the eye of the viewer when observed from a distance. Black was used very sparingly, or not at all, and defining lines replaced with nuanced strokes of color forming the subjects, contours, and shapes. Art historian H. W. Janson said \"instead of adding to the illusion of real space, it strengthens the unity of the actual painted surface.\"<ref name=\"Janson (1977)\" /> Impressionist paintings typically depict landscapes, portraits, still lifes, domestic scenes, daily leisure and nightlife, all treated in a realist manner. Compositions were often based on unusual perspectives, appearing spontaneous and candid. The paintings were usually void of didactic, symbolic, or metaphoric meanings, and rarely addressed the biblical, mythological, and historical subjects that were so highly regarded by the academies or the darker and psychological interest explored by the symbolist. The nuances of light, shadow, atmosphere, and reflections of colors from surfaces were examined, sometimes emphasizing changes of these elements in time. The painting itself was the subject of the painting. It was art for art's sake, an idea that had been floating around for a few of decades but it perhaps reached a new high and consistency in impressionism.<ref name=\"Ponente (1965)\" /><ref name=\"Blunden & Blunden (1976)\" /><ref name=\"Courthion (1979)\" /><ref name=\"Leymarie (1955)\" />\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nFile:Edgar Degas, 1867c - Ballerinas in Pink.jpg|''Dancers in Pink''; [[Edgar Degas]]; 1867; oil on canvas, 59 \u00d7 74 cm.; Hill\u2013Stead Museum, Farmington, Connecticut (USA)\nFile:Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bazille 002.jpg|''View of the Village''; by [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bazille]]; 1868; oil on canvas, 130 \u00d7 89 cm.; Mus\u00e9e Fabre, Montpellier, (France)\nFile:Monet Painting on His Studio Boat Edouard Manet 1874.jpg|''Claude Monet in Argenteuil''; by [[\u00c9douard Manet]]; 1874; oil on canvas, 80 \u00d7 98 cm.; Neue Pinakothek, Munich (Germany) \nFile:Claude Monet 010.jpg|''The Railway Bridge at Argenteuil''; by [[Claude Monet]]; 1874; oil on canvas (60 \u00d7 80 cm); Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, Paris (France)\nFile:Guillaumin LaPlaceValhubert.jpg|''La Place Valhubert'' ;by [[Armand Guillaumin]]; 1875; oil on canvas.\nFile:Gustave Caillebotte - Mademoiselle Boissi\u00e8re Knitting - Google Art Project.jpg|''Mademoiselle Boissi\u00e8re Knitting''; by [[Gustave Caillebotte]]; 1877; oil on canvas, 65 \u00d7 80 cm.; Museum of Fine Arts, Houston (USA)\nFile:Nature morte, bol de pommes, par Paul C\u00e9zanne.jpg|''Bowl with Apples''; by [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]]; 1878\u201379; oil on canvas, 45.5 \u00d7 55 cm.; Annenberg Collection, Palm Springs (USA)\nFile:Berthe Morisot - Sommertag - 1879.jpeg|''Summer-day: Lake in the Bois de Boulogne''; by [[Berthe Morisot]]; 1879; oil on canvas, 45.7 \u00d7 75.2 cm.; National Gallery, London (England)\nFile:Alfred Sisley, Banks of the Seine at By.jpg|Banks of the Seine at By; by Alfred Sisley; ca. 1880\u201381; oil on canvas, 54.3 \u00d7 73.3 cm.; Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute, Williamstown, Massachusetts (USA)\nFile:Mary Cassatt, Automne, portrait de Lydia Cassatt, 1880, ppp706, Petit Palais.jpg|''Autumn, Lydia Cassatt''; [[Mary Cassatt]]; 1880; oil on canvas, 92.5 \u00d7 65.5 cm.; Petit Palais, Paris (France)\nFile:Pierre-Auguste Renoir 023.jpg|''The Loge''; by [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]]; 1881; oil on canvas, 127 \u00d7 92 cm.; Courtauld Institute of Art, London (England)\nFile:Edouard Manet, A Bar at the Folies-Berg\u00e8re.jpg|''A Bar at the Folies-Berg\u00e8re''; by [[\u00c9douard Manet]]; 1881\u201382; oil on canvas, 96 \u00d7 130 cm.; Courtauld Institute of Art, London (England)\nFile:Bordighera.jpg|''Bordighera''; by [[Claude Monet]]; 1884; oil on canvas, 81 \u00d7 65 cm.; Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago (USA)\nFile:Camille Pissarro 003.jpg|''Place du Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Fran\u00e7ais, Paris'': Rain; by [[Camille Pissarro]]; 1898; oil on canvas, 73.6 \u00d7 91.4 cm.; Minneapolis Institute of Art (USA)\nFile:Claude Monet - The Water Lilies - Morning - Google Art Project.jpg|''Water Lilies, Morning''; by [[Claude Monet]]; ca. 1814\u201324; oil on canvas, 2,000 \u00d7 12,750 mm; Mus\u00e9e de l'Orangerie, Paris (France)\n</gallery>\n\n==== Symbolism (c. 1860\u20131915) ====\n{{main|Symbolism (art)}}\n[[File:Head of Orpheus.jpg|thumb|150px|left|''Thracian Girl with Head of Orpheus on his Lyre''; by [[Gustave Moreau]]; 1865; oil; 154 x 99.5 cm; [[Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay]] (Paris)]]\nSymbolism emerged in France and Belgium in the 3rd quarter of the nineteenth century and spread throughout Europe in the 1870s, and later to America to a lesser extent. It evolved from romanticism without a clear or defining demarcation point, although poetry, literature, and specifically the publication of [[Charles Baudelaire|Charles Baudelaire's]] ''[[Les Fleurs du mal]]'' (''The Flowers of Evil'') in 1857 were significant in the development of symbolism. It had international expression in poetry, literature, drama, and music. In architecture, the applied arts, and decorative arts symbolism closely paralleled and overlapped into [[Art Nouveau]]. Symbolism is often inextricably linked to other contemporary art movements, surfacing and finding expression within other styles like [[Post-Impressionism]], [[Les Nabis]], the [[Decadent Movement]], the [[Fin de si\u00e8cle|Fin-de Siecle]], [[Art Nouveau]], The [[Munich Secession]], The [[Vienna Secession]], [[Expressionism]], and even the [[Pre-Raphaelites]], which had formed before and influenced symbolism as well. Artist as diverse as [[James McNeill Whistler]], [[Eug\u00e8ne Carri\u00e8re]], [[Ferdinand Hodler]], [[Fernand Khnopff]], [[Giovanni Segantini]], [[Lucien L\u00e9vy-Dhurmer]], [[Jean Delville]], and [[James Ensor]] all had varying degrees of association with symbolism. Art historian Robert L. Delevoy wrote \"Symbolism was less a school than the atmosphere of a period.\"<ref name=\"Delevoy (1978)\">Delevoy, Robert L. (1978) Symbolists and Symbolism.

It began in the late-19th century [[United Kingdom|Britain]], when writers such as [[John Ruskin]] and [[William Morris]] rejected mass-production and the often poor quality, machine-made items that were found in many homes and shops. [[William Morris|Morris]], in particular, believed in the importance of the individual craftsman, and advocated a return to hand craftsman, which, he argued, would not only produce better furniture, pottery, textiles, and other items, but would also help people to lead better, more fulfilling lives. Mass-production, he maintained, was responsible for a decline in values. Many Arts and Crafts designers drew upon the influence of medieval craftsmanship, and their objects and interiors exploited the distinctive qualities of natural materials, from beautifully finished [[oak]] to hand-woven tapestries. Others, however, looked further afield for inspiration, incorporating vivid colours inspired by [[Islamic art]], or [[Art of ancient Egypt|ancient Egyptian]] motifs in their work. Knots, swirls, [[Celtic cross]]es, and entrelac (interlanced designs) inspired by ancient [[Celtic art]] featured in the work of many Arts and Craftsdesigners, notably [[Archibald Knox (designer)|Archibald Knox]], especially on metalwork.\n\n==== Art Nouveau (c. 1870\u20131915)====\n{{main|Art Nouveau}} \n[[File:The Peacock Room.jpg|275px|thumb|''The Peacock Room''; by [[James McNeil Whistler]]; 1876\u20131877; Freer Gallery of Art, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, USA]]The earliest influences of Art Nouveau began to emerge in England among figures such as [[John Ruskin]], the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]], [[Edward Burne-Jones]], [[William Morris]] and the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]], which paralleled some aspects of symbolist sensibilities in France and Belgium at that time. Art Nouveau is closely allied and intermingled with symbolism. The term Art Nouveau is most often applied to architecture, crafts, and decorative arts, while symbolism is more commonly used for fine arts like painting and sculpture as well as poetry and literature, however there are no hard, defining lines between the two. Art Nouveau was an international movement that spread throughout Europe and North America reaching its peak around 1890\u20131905. It perhaps found its greatest expressions in architecture, influenced by theorist and historian [[Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc]], and seen in the work of [[Victor Horta]], [[Hector Guimard]], [[Louis Sullivan]], and [[Antoni Gaud\u00ed]]. However extraordinary examples of the style appeared in interior design, furniture, wallpaper, textiles, mosaics, ceramics, metalworking, jewelry, art glass, stain glass windows, and other decorative and applied arts produced by [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]],  [[Peter Carl Faberg\u00e9]], [[\u00c9mile Gall\u00e9]], [[Ren\u00e9 Lalique]], [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]], and many others. Japanese art, particularly the [[Woodblock printing in Japan|woodcut prints]], with design concepts that were new to Europeans began to appear and found receptive audiences there, where graphic artist such as [[Aubrey Beardsley]], [[Jules Ch\u00e9ret]], [[Walter Crane]], [[Eug\u00e8ne Grasset]], [[Alphonse Mucha]], and [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]] designed innovative posters, advertising, fashions, book binding, frontispieces, and illustrations.<ref name=\"Bouillon,  1985\">Bouillon, Jean-Paul. 1985.

Many artisans sought to breakdown the divide between fine art, applied art, and decorative art and merge them all into every aspect of daily life. Individual artist frequently moved back and forth between various disciplines and worked in several media. It was not unusual for architects to produce the furniture and other furnishings for the houses and building they designed, for painters to design advertising posters and book illustrations, or jewelers to produce art glass, and stain glass windows.<ref name=\"Bouillon,  1985\" /><ref name=\"FahrBecker, 1997\" />\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nFile:Aubrey Beardsley - The Climax.jpg|thumb|''Climax'', illustration for Oscar Wilde's Salome; by [[Aubrey Vincent Beardsley]]; 1893; etching\n\nHenri de Toulouse-Lautrec - Divan Japonais - Google Art Project.jpg|''[[Divan Japonais (lithograph)|Divan Japonais]]''; by [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]]; circa 1893\u20131894; litograph; 81 x 62.3 cm; [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts]] ([[Boston]], USA)\n\nFile:Statuette Lo\u00efe Fuller par Pierre Roche.jpg|thumb|''[[Loie Fuller]] Dancing''; by [[Pierre Roche]]; 1894 (Bronze, 1901); Mus\u00e9e des Arts D\u00e9coratifs (Paris)\n\nFile:Castel B\u00e9ranger, February 16, 2013.jpg|''Castel B\u00e9ranger'', Gate (apartment building); by [[Hector Guimard]]; 1895\u20131898; Paris\n\nFile:H\u00f4tel Solvay; by Victor Horta; 1895-1898; Brussels.jpg|''H\u00f4tel Solvay''; by [[Victor Horta]], architect; 1895\u20131898; [[Brussels]] ([[Belgium]])\n\nFile:Vase, by \u00c9mile Gall\u00e9, 1896; glass, height, 17.5 cm, Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York City).jpg|thumb|Vase, by \u00c9mile Gall\u00e9, 1896; glass, height, 17.5 cm, Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York City)\n\nFile:Alfons Mucha - 1896 - Biscuits Lef\u00e8vre-Utile.jpg|''Biscuits Lef\u00e8vre-Utile'', advertisement; by [[Alfons Mucha]]; 1896; lithograph; 62 \u00d7 43.5 cm; private collection\n\nRen\u00e9 lailique, pettorale libellula, in oro, smalti, crisoprazio, calcedonio, pietre lunari e diamanti, 1897-98 ca. 01.jpg|The ''Dragonfly brooch''; by [[Ren\u00e9 Lalique]]; circa 1897\u20131898; gold, [[vitreous enamel]], [[chrysoprase]], [[chalcedony]], [[moonstone (gemstone)|moonstone]] and diamond; height: 23 cm, width: 26.5 cm; [[Calouste Gulbenkian Museum]] ([[Lisboa]], Portugal) \n\nTsunami by hokusai 19th century.jpg|''[[The Great Wave off Kanagawa]]''; by [[Katsushika Hokusai]]; circa 1830\u20131832; full-colour woodblock print; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nSculptural bowl MET DP325860.jpg|Sculptural bowl; 1900; stoneware; 27.6 \u00d7 55.2 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nLe Jeu de l'echarpe (Dancer with scarf), by Agathon Leonard, before 1901, Susse Freres, Paris, gilt bronze - Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt - Darmstadt, Germany - DSC00944.jpg|''Le Jeu de l'echarpe'' (Dancer with scarf); by Agathon Leonard; before 1901; gilt bronze; [[Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt]] ([[Darmstadt]], Germany)\n\nRen\u00e9 lalique, pettine in corno, oro, smalti e brillanti, 1902 ca-V2.jpg|Hair ornament; by [[Ren\u00e9 Lalique]]; circa 1902; gold, emeralds and diamonds; [[Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay]] (Paris)\n\nFile:\u03a3\u03b1\u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03b4\u03b1 \u03a6\u03b1\u03bc\u03af\u03bb\u03b9\u03b1 2941.jpg|''Bas\u00edlica de la Sagrada Fam\u00edlia''; by [[Antoni Gaud\u00ed]]; began in 1882 and still under construction; [[Barcelona]] (Spain) [cranes digitally removed]\n\nFile:Casa Batllo Overview Barcelona Spain cut.jpg|The ''[[Casa Batll\u00f3]]''; by Antoni Gaud\u00ed; Barcelona\n\nArt Nouveau Dining Masson.jpg|Cabinet; [[Eugene Vallin]] in collaboration with [[Victor Prouv\u00e9]]; circa 1903\u20131906; probably made of mahogany; [[Mus\u00e9e de l'\u00c9cole de Nancy]] ([[Nancy, France|Nancy]], France)\n</gallery>\n\n=== Post-Impressionism (c. 1885 - 1905) ===\n{{main|Post-Impressionism}}\n[[File:Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, At the Moulin Rouge.jpg|thumb|''At the Moulin Rouge''; by [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]]; 1892; oil on canvas, 123 \u00d7 140.5 cm.; Art Institute of Chicago (USA)]] Post-Impressionism is a rather imprecise term applied to a diverse generation of artist. In its strictest sense, it pertains to four highly influential artist: [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]],<ref>Raynal, M. (1954) ''Cezanne'': Biographical and Critical Study: The Taste of Our Time, Vol. 8.

Abrams, Inc., Publishers, New York, 131 pp. </ref> Each passed through an impressionist phase, but ultimately emerged with four very original but different styles. Collectively, their work anticipated, and often directly influenced, much of the [[avant-garde]] art that appear before the First World War including fauvism, cubism, expressionism, and early abstraction. C\u00e9zanne (particularly influential on cubism) and Van Gogh worked in relative isolation, away from Paris, at critical points in their careers, while Seurat and Gauguin worked in groups, more collaboratively, at key points in their development. Another important artist of the period is [[Toulouse-Lautrec]], an influential painter as well as graphic artist.<ref>Lassaigne, J. (1953) Lautrec: Biographical and Critical Studies, The Taste of Our Time, Vol. 3. Editions D'Art Albert Skira, Geneva, 121 pp.</ref><ref>Cooper, D. (1966) Toulouse-Lautrec: The Library of Great Painters. Harry N. Abrams, Inc., Publishers, New York, 152 pp.</ref> In a broader sense, post-impressionism includes a generation of predominantly French and Belgian artist who worked in a range of styles and groups. Most had come under the sway of impressionism at some point, but pushed their work beyond it into a number of factions as early as the mid 1880s, sometimes as a logical development of impressionism, other times as a reaction against it. Post-Impressionist typically depicted impressionist subjects, but the work, particularly synthetism, often contained symbolism, spiritualism, and moody atmospheres that rarely appeared in impressionism. Unnatural colors, patterns, flat plains, odd perspectives and viewpoints pushed to extremes, all moved the center of modernism a step closer to abstraction with a standard for experimentation.<ref name=\"Arnason (1977)\" /><ref name=\"Raynal (1953)\">Raynal, Maurice (1953) ''Modern Painting'': Painting, Color, History. Editions D'Art Albert Skira, Geneva, 339 pp. [Translated to English by Stuart Gilbert]</ref><ref name=\"Daval (1979)\" />\n\n'''[[Neo-Impressionism]]''' ([[Divisionism]] or [[Pointillism]], c. 1884-1894) explored light and color based on scientific color theories, creating mosaics of brush strokes in pure colors, sometimes laid out in rhythmic patterns with lines influenced by art nouuveau. The leading artist were [[Georges Seurat]] and [[Paul Signac]], others include [[Henri-Edmond Cross]], [[Maximilien Luce]], [[Albert Dubois-Pillet]], and for a period [[Pissarro]] and [[Van Gogh]]. It was influential on fauvism, and elements of the style appeared in expressionism, cubism, and early abstraction. '''[[Synthetism]]''' ([[Cloisonnism]] c. 1888-1903) Cloisonnism was conceived by [[\u00c9mile Bernard]] and immediately taken up and developed by [[Paul Gauguin]] and others while at an artists' colony in Pont-Aven, Brittany, France. The style resembled [[cloisonn\u00e9 enamel]] or [[Stained glass|stained glass]], with flat, bold colors outlined in black or dark colors. Synthetism, exemplified in the work of Gauguin and [[Paul S\u00e9rusier]], is slightly a broader term with less emphasis on dark outlines and cloisonn\u00e9 qualities. Other artist include [[Cuno Amiet]], [[Louis Anquetin]], [[Charles Filiger]], [[Meyer de Haan |Jacob Meyer de Haan]], [[Charles Laval]], and [[Armand S\u00e9guin (painter)|Armand Seguin]]. Their work greatly influenced fauvism and expressionism. '''[[Les Nabis]]''' [c. 1890-1905: Hebrew for prophets or illuminati] was a larger movement in France and Belgium that eclectically drew on progressive elements in synthetism, neo-impressionism, symbolism, and art nouuveau. Perhaps more influential than the art, were the numerous theories, manifestoes, and infectious enthusiasm for the avant-garde, setting the tone for the proliferation of movements and \"isms\" in the first quarter of the 20th century. [[La Revue Blanche]] often published Las Nabis and symbolist content. The work of [[\u00c9douard Vuillard]]<ref>Preston, S. (1974) ''Vuillard'': The Library of Great Painters. Harry N.

Its genesis was in 1895 when [[Henri Matisse]], the oldest and central figure, entered the studio of [[Gustave Moreau]] at the [[Ecole des Beaux Arts (Paris)|Ecole des Beaux-Arts]]. There he met [[Georges Rouault]], [[Charles Camoin]], [[Henri Manguin]], and [[Albert Marquet]]. Marquet said \"As early as 1898 Matisse and I were working in what was later to be called the Fauve manner. The first exhibitions at the Indep\u00e9ndants in which we were, I believe, the only ones to paint in pure tones, go back to 1901.\"<ref name=\"Leymarie (1959)\">Leymarie, J. (1959) Fauvism: Biographical and Critical Study, The Taste of Our Time, Vol. 28. Editions D'Art Albert Skira, Geneva.165 pp.</ref> By 1902-03 the circle of like-minded artist had grown to include [[Georges Braque]], [[Andr\u00e9 Derain]], [[Raoul Dufy]], [[Othon Friesz]], [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Jean Puy]], [[Louis Valtat]], [[Kees van Dongen]], and [[Maurice de Vlaminck]]. During this period a number of influential retrospective exhibitions were held in Paris: Seurat (1900, 1905), Van Gogh (1901, 1905), Toulouse-Lautrec (1902), Gauguin (1906), Cezanne (1907), all relatively unknown to the public at that time. Matisse and Derain collected African carvings, a novel but growing curiosity of the time. Matisse spent the summer of 1904 in [[Saint-Tropez]] painting with the neo-impressionist [[Paul Signac]] and [[Henri-Edmond Cross]], followed in1905 by Camoin, Manguin, and Marquet. The artist exhibited regularity at the [[Salon Des Independants|Salon des Indep\u00e9ndants]] and the [[Salon d'Automne]] 1903-1908 and in 1905 their work created a sensation and a scandal. Matisse stated \"We were exhibiting at the Salon d'Automne, Derain, Manguin, Marquet, Puy, and a few others were hung together in one of the larger galleries. In the center of this room the sculptor [[Albert Marque|Marque]] exhibited a bust of a child very much in the Italian style. [[Louis Vauxcelles|Vauxcelles]] [art critic for [[Gil Blas (periodical)|Gil Blas]]] entered the room and said, Well! well! [[Donatello]] in the mist of wild beasts!

Unlike the impressionist and their long struggle for acceptance, the avant-garde had an eager audience by 1906-1907 and the fauvist were attracting collectors from America to Russia. However fauvism largely dissolved in 1908, as cubism appeared, most of the artist began exploring other styles and moving in different directions.

They applied paint with loose brushstrokes, in thick, unnatural, often contrasting, vibrant colors, at times straight from the tube. Gauguin's influence, with his exploration of the expressive values and spatial aspects of patterning with flat, pure colors, as well as his interest in [[primitivism]] were significant, as was neo-impressionism. Matisse explained - for a long time color served as a complement of design, the painters of the Renaissance constructed the picture by line, adding local color afterwards - writing: \"From [[Delacroix]] to Van Gogh and chiefly to Gauguin, by way of the Impressionist, who cleared the ground, and C\u00e9zanne, who gave the final impulse and introduced colored volumes, we can follow this rehabilitation of color's function, this restoration of its emotive power\"<ref name=\"Leymarie (1959)\" /> Fauvism was the culmination in changing the fundamental role of color in painting and they depicted their subjects on the verge of abstraction.<ref name=\"Leymarie (1959)\" /><ref name=\"Clay (1978)\" /> <ref name=\"Diehl (1972)\" /> <ref name=\"Lassaigne (1959)\" /> <ref name=\"Jacobus (1973)\" />\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nFile:Bonheur Matisse.jpg|thumb|''[[Le bonheur de vivre]]'', by [[Henri Matisse]]; 1905\u20131906; oil on canvas; 175 x 241&nbsp;cm; [[Barnes Foundation]]\nFile:Houses at Chatou.jpg|thumb|''Houses at Chatou''; by [[Maurice de Vlaminck]]; ca. 1905; oil on canvas, 81 \u00d7 101 cm; Art Institute of Chicago (USA)\nFile:Fauvism Landscape; by Louis Valtat; oil on canvas, Speed Art Museum, Louisville, Kentucky II.jpg|thumb|''Fauve Landscape''; by [[Louis Valtat]]; 1905\u20131906; oil on canvas; Speed Art Museum, Louisville, Kentucky\nFile:Derain CharingCrossBridge.png|thumb|''Charing Cross Bridge, London''; by [[Andr\u00e9 Derain]]; 1906; oil on canvas, 80.3 x 100.3 cm.; National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC. \nFile:LA CIOTAT.PNG|thumb|''La Ciotat''; by [[Othon Friesz]]; 1907; oil on canvas, 65.7 by 81 cm.; collection unknown \n</gallery>\n\n===Early 20th century===\n{{See also|20th-century Western painting}}\nThe history of [[20th-century art]] is a narrative of endless possibilities and the search for new standards, each being torn down in succession by the next.

Increasing [[globalization|global]] interaction during this time saw an equivalent influence of other cultures into Western art, such as [[Pablo Picasso]] being influenced by [[Iberian sculpture]], [[African art|African sculpture]] and [[Primitivism]]. [[Japonism]], and Japanese [[woodcut]]s (which had themselves been influenced by Western Renaissance draftsmanship) had an immense influence on Impressionism and subsequent artistic developments. The influential example set by [[Paul Gauguin]]'s interest in [[Oceanic art]] and the sudden popularity among the [[Connoisseur|cognoscenti]] in early 20th century Paris of newly discovered African fetish sculptures and other works from non-European cultures were taken up by Picasso, [[Henri Matisse]], and many of their colleagues.

The small and short lived [[Metaphysical art|Metaphysical School]] (ca. 1910-1921), with [[Giorgio de Chirico]] as its principal figure, was highly influential on surrealism. The surrealist explored a myriad of innovative techniques, some had recently been developed in Cubism and Dada, others were new, including [[collage]], found objects, assemblage, random chance, rayographs (photograms), painting on sand, dripping and flinging paint, [[decalcomania]], [[Frottage (art)|frottage]], [[Fumage|fumage]], and raclage. Two fundamental approaches predominate surrealist art. [[Surrealist automatism|Automatism]] dominated in the early years which can be seen in the work of artist like [[Andr\u00e9 Masson]] and [[Joan Mir\u00f3|Joan Mir\u00f3]]. Other artist, swayed by work of Giorgio de Chirico, used more traditional methods and mediums to illustrate unfiltered thoughts and incongruous juxtapositions, including [[Salvador Dali]] and [[Ren\u00e9 Magritte]]. Significant artist include [[Jean Arp]], [[Hans Bellmer]], [[Victor Brauner]], [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]], [[Joseph Cornell]], [[\u00d3scar Dom\u00ednguez]], [[Max Ernst]], [[Wifredo Lam]], [[Yves Tanguy]], [[Man Ray]], [[Alberto Giacometti]], [[M\u00e9ret Oppenheim]], and [[Roberto Matta]]. Other important artist informally accosted with surrealism include [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Pablo Picasso]], and [[Frida Kahlo]]. Surrealist ideas and theories were discussed in a successive series of journals, ''[[La R\u00e9volution Surr\u00e9aliste]]'' (1924-1929), ''[[Le Surrealisme au service de la revolution]]'' (1930-1933), ''[[Minotaure]]'' (1933-1939), ''[[VVV (magazine)|VVV]]'' (1942-1944). The automatic paintings produced by Andr\u00e9 Masson and Juna Mir\u00f3, as well as latecomers to surrealism like Roberto Matta and [[Arshile Gorky]] had a considerable influenced on the [[abstract expressionist]] in the late 1940s. <ref name=\"Waldberg (1962)\">Waldberg, Patrick (1962) ''Surrealism'', The Taste of Our Time, Vol. 37, Editions D'Art Albert Skira, Geneva, 151 pp.</ref><ref name=\"Rubin (1968)\">Rubin, William S.

The separation of regional cultures that had marked the 19th century was replaced by a global culture.

[[Visual art]] [[art#Forms, genres, media and styles|can be classified in diverse ways]], such as separating [[fine art]]s from [[applied arts]]; inclusively focusing on human creativity; or focusing on different media such as [[architecture]], [[sculpture]], [[painting]], [[film]], [[photography]], and [[graphic arts]]. In recent years, technological advances have led to [[video]] art, [[Digital art|computer art]], [[Performance art]], [[animation]], [[television]], and [[Video game|videogames]].\n\nThe history of art is often told as a chronology of [[masterpiece]]s created during each [[civilization]]. It can thus be framed as a story of [[high culture]], epitomized by the [[Wonders of the World]]. On the other hand, [[vernacular]] art expressions can also be integrated into art historical narratives, referred to as [[folk arts]] or [[craft]]. The more closely that an art historian engages with these latter forms of [[low culture]], the more likely it is that they will identify their work as examining [[visual culture]] or [[material culture]], or as contributing to fields related to art history, such as [[anthropology]] or [[archaeology]]. In the latter cases, art objects may be referred to as [[Artifact (archaeology)|archeological artifacts]].\n\n==Prehistory==\n{{Main|Prehistoric art}}\n[[File:Homo Erectus shell with geometric incisions circa 500,000 BP, Naturalis Biodiversity Center, Netherlands (with detail).jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|This ''[[Homo erectus]]'' shell with geometric incisions, has been claimed as the first known work of art; circa 500,000 BP; From [[Trinil]] ([[Java]]); [[Naturalis Biodiversity Center]] ([[Netherlands]])<ref name=\"Nature Article\">{{cite journal |last1=Callaway |first1=Ewen |title=Homo erectus made world's oldest doodle 500,000 years ago |journal=Nature News |doi=10.1038/nature.2014.16477 |url=https://www.nature.com/news/homo-erectus-made-world-s-oldest-doodle-500-000-years-ago-1.16477 |language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"NS\"/>]]\n[[File:Stone Age Animal Carving, Hayonim Cave, 28000 BP.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Carving of a horse with traces of [[ocher]] painting; 40,000\u201318,500 BP; from the [[Hayonim Cave]], [[Levantine Aurignacian]]; [[Israel Museum]] ([[Jerusalem]]).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Yi\u015bra\u02bcel (Jerusalem) |first1=Muze\u02bcon |last2=Museum (Jerusalem) |first2=Israel |title=Treasures of the Holy Land: Ancient Art from the Israel Museum |date=1986 |publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art |isbn=9780870994708 |page=29 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KPVTCRYPfFMC&pg=PA29 |language=en}}</ref><ref>\"Horse from Hayonim Cave, Israel, 30,000 years\" in {{cite book |title=Israel Museum Studies in Archaeology |date=2002 |publisher=Samuel Bronfman Biblical and Archaeological Museum of the Israel Museum |page=10 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w7NtAAAAMAAJ |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Hayonim horse |url=https://museums.gov.il/en/items/Pages/ItemCard.aspx?IdItem=ICMS_IMJ_330094 |website=museums.gov.il}}</ref><ref name=\"BY\">{{cite book |last1=Bar-Yosef |first1=Ofer |last2=Belfer-Cohen |first2=Anna |title=The Aurignacian at Hayonim Cave |date=1981 |pages=35\u201336 |url=https://www.persee.fr/doc/paleo_0153-9345_1981_num_7_2_4296}}</ref> This may be one of the earliest known manifestation of human art, together with [[:File:Claimed Oldest Known Drawing by Human Hands Discovered in South African Cave.jpg|the ocher pieces]] of [[Blombos Cave]] in [[South Africa]], before the outpouring of [[parietal art]] in Europe.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sale |first1=Kirkpatrick |title=After Eden: The Evolution of Human Domination |date=2006 |publisher=Duke University Press |isbn=9780822339380 |page=57 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2q9780EgEBEC&pg=PA57 |language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"NYT-20180912\"/>]]\nEngraved shells created by ''[[Homo erectus]]'' dating as far back as 500,000 years ago have been found, although experts disagree on whether these engravings can be properly classified as \u2018art\u2019.<ref name=\"Nature Article\"/><ref name=\"NS\">{{cite journal |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22429983.200-shell-art-made-300000-years-before-humans-evolved.html |title=Shell 'art' made 300,000 years before humans evolved |journal=[[New Scientist]] |first=Catherine |last=Brahic |date=3 December 2014 |access-date=29 September 2018}}</ref> A number of claims of ''[[Neanderthal]]'' art, adornment, and structures have been made, dating from around 130,000 before present and suggesting that Neanderthals may have been capable of [[Symbolic behavior|symbolic thought]],<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=ScienceDaily|title=Neanderthals were not inferior to modern humans, study finds|date=April 30, 2014|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/04/140430133054.htm}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Sci News|last=E.|first=de Lazaro|date=January 18, 2017|title=Neanderthals Capable of Incorporating Symbolic Objects into Their Culture, Discovery Suggests|url=http://www.sci-news.com/archaeology/neanderthals-symbolic-objects-04545.html}}</ref> but none of these claims are widely accepted.<ref>{{cite magazine|author=N.

It is clear that such workmanship existed by 40,000 years ago in the [[Upper Paleolithic]] era, although it is quite possible that it began earlier.\n\nThe artistic manifestations of the Upper-Paleolithic reached their peak in the [[Magdalenian]] period (\u00b115,000\u20138,000&nbsp;BC).

The term [[Epipaleolithic]] is often used synonymously, especially for outside [[northern Europe]], and for the corresponding period in [[Epipaleolithic Near East|the Levant]] and [[Epipaleolithic Caucasus|Caucasus]]. The Mesolithic has different time spans in different parts of Eurasia. It refers to the final period of [[hunter-gatherer]] cultures in Europe and West Asia, between the end of the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] and the [[Neolithic Revolution]]. In Europe it spans roughly 15,000 to 5,000&nbsp;BP, in Southwest Asia (the [[Epipalaeolithic Near East]]) roughly 20,000 to 8,000&nbsp;BP.\nThe term is less used of areas further east, and not at all beyond Eurasia and North Africa.\n\n===Neolithic===\n{{Main|Neolithic}}\nThe Neolithic period began about 10,000 BC. The [[rock art of the Iberian Mediterranean Basin]]\u2014dated between the Mesolithic and Neolithic eras\u2014contained small, schematic paintings of human figures, with notable examples in [[Roca dels Moros|El Cogul]], Valltorta, [[Alpera]] and Minateda.\n\nNeolithic painting is similar to paintings found in northern Africa ([[Atlas Mountains|Atlas]], Sahara) and in the area of modern Zimbabwe. Neolithic painting is often schematic, made with basic strokes (men in the form of a [[cross]] and women in a [[triangle|triangular]] shape). There are also cave paintings in [[Pinturas River]] in [[Argentina]], especially the [[Cueva de las Manos]]. In [[portable art]], a style called [[Cardium pottery]] was produced, decorated with imprints of [[seashell]]s. New materials were used in art, such as [[amber]], [[crystal]], and [[jasper]]. In this period, the first traces of urban planning appeared, such as the remains in [[Jericho#Tell es-Sultan|Tell as-Sultan]] ([[Jericho]]), [[Jarmo]] (Iraq) and [[\u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck]] ([[Anatolia]]).{{sfn|Onians|2004|pp=20\u201325}} In South-Eastern Europe appeared many cultures, such as the [[Cucuteni-Trypillia culture]] (from [[Romania]], [[Republic of Moldova]] and [[Ukraine]]), and the [[Hamangia culture]] (from Romania and [[Bulgaria]]). Other regions with many cultures are China, most notable being the [[Yangshao culture]] and the [[Longshan culture]]; and Egypt, with the [[Badarian culture|Badarian]], the [[Naqada I]], [[Naqada II|II]] and [[Naqada III|III]] cultures.\n\nCommon materials of neolithic sculptures from [[Anatolia]], are ivory, stone, clay and bone. Many are [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]], especially female, [[zoomorphism|zoomorphic]] ones being rare. Female figurines are both fat and slender. Both zoomorphic and anthropomorphic carvings have been discovered in [[Siberia]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]] and [[China]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Drimba|first1=Ovidiu|title= Istoria Culturii \u0219i Civiliza\u021biei|date=1985|publisher=Editura \u0219tiin\u021bific\u0103 \u0219i enciclopedic\u0103|isbn=|page=52|url=|language=ro}}</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nFile:Urfa man.jpg|The ''[[Urfa Man]]''; from modern-day [[Turkey]]; c. 9000 BC; [[sandstone]]; height: 1.8 m; [[\u015eanl\u0131urfa Archaeology and Mosaic Museum]] ([[Urfa]], Turkey)\nFile:Bowl fragment MET DP368821.jpg|Fragment of a bowl; by [[Halaf culture]] from [[Mesopotamia]]; 5600-5000 BC; cermaic; 8.2&nbsp;cm; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\nClay vase. 6th millennia B.C.jpg|Globular jar; by [[Dimini#Neolithic|Dimini culture]] from Greece; 5300-4800 BC; ceramic; height: 25&nbsp;cm (9{{fraction|3|4}} in.), diameter at rim: 12&nbsp;cm (4{{fraction|3|4}} in.); [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens|National Archaeological Museum]] ([[Athens]])\n\u601d\u60f3\u8005\u5851\u50cf.JPG|''The Thinker''; by [[Hamangia culture]] from Romania; c. 5000 BC; terracotta; height: 11.5&nbsp;cm (4{{1/2}} in.); [[National Museum of Romanian History]] ([[Bucharest]])\nSerbia, Vin\u00e7a culture, Neolithic Era - Vinca Idol - 2000.201 - Cleveland Museum of Art.tif|Female figure; by [[Vin\u010da culture]] from [[Serbia]]; 4500-3500 BC; fired clay with paint; overall: 16.1&nbsp;cm; [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] ([[Ohio]], US)\nPredynastic bearded man-MGR Lyon-IMG 9928.jpg|Figurine of a bearded man; by the [[Naqada I]] culture from Egypt; 3800-3500 BC; [[breccia]]; from [[Upper Egypt]]; [[Mus\u00e9e des Confluences]] ([[Lyon]], France)\nClevelandart 1984.68.jpg|`Flame-style\u2019 vessel; from the [[J\u014dmon period]] of Japan; c. 2750 BC; earthenware with carved and applied decoration; height: 61&nbsp;cm, diameter: 55.8&nbsp;cm; [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] ([[Ohio]], US)\n\u534a\u5c71\u7c7b\u578b\u5706\u70b9\u7eb9\u5f69\u9676\u58f6.jpg|Dotted pottery pot, semi-mountain type; by the [[Yangshao culture]] from China; 2700\u20132300 BC; [[Gansu Provincial Museum]] ([[Lanzhou]]; China)\n</gallery>\n\n===Metal Age===\n[[File:Solvognen-00100.tif|thumb|left|250px|''[[Trundholm sun chariot]]''; c. 1400 BC; bronze; height: 35 cm (14 in.), width: 54 cm (21 in.); [[National Museum of Denmark]] ([[Copenhagen]])]]\nThe last prehistoric phase is the Metal Age (or [[Three-age system]]), during which the use of [[copper]], [[bronze]] and [[iron]] transformed ancient societies. When humans could smelt metal and forge metal implements could make new tools, weapons, and art.\n\nIn the [[Chalcolithic]] (Copper Age) [[megalith]]s emerged. Examples include the [[dolmen]] and [[menhir]] and the [[England|English]] [[wikt:cromlech|cromlech]], as can be seen in the complexes at [[Newgrange]] and [[Stonehenge]].{{sfn|Gardner|Kleiner|2009|p=12}} In Spain the [[Los Millares]] culture was formed which was characterized by the [[Beaker culture]]. In [[Malta]], the [[Megalithic Temples of Malta|temple complexes]] of [[\u0126a\u0121ar Qim]], [[Mnajdra]], [[Tarxien Temples|Tarxien]] and [[\u0120gantija]] were built. In the [[Balearic Islands]] notable megalithic cultures developed, with different types of monuments: the ''[[naveta]]'', a tomb shaped like a truncated [[pyramid]], with an elongated burial chamber; the ''[[taula]]'', two large stones, one put vertically and the other horizontally above each other; and the ''[[talaiot]]'', a tower with a covered chamber and a false [[dome]].<ref>Azc\u00e1rate (1983), pp. 24\u201328.</ref>\n\nIn the [[Iron Age]] the cultures of [[Hallstatt]] (Austria) and [[La Tene]] ([[Switzerland]]) emerged in Europe. The first was developed between the 7th and 5th century BC by the [[List of necropoleis|necropoleis]] with tumular tombs and a wooden burial chamber in the form of a house, often accompanied by a four-wheeled cart. The pottery was [[Polychrome|polychromic]], with [[geometry|geometric]] decorations and applications of metallic ornaments. La Tene was developed between the 5th and 4th century BC, and is more popularly known as early [[Celtic art]]. It produced many iron objects such as [[sword]]s and [[spear]]s, which have not survived well to the 2000s due to rust.\n\nThe [[Bronze Age]] refers to the period when bronze was the best material available.  Bronze was used for highly decorated [[shield]]s, [[Fibula (brooch)|fibulas]], and other objects, with different stages of evolution of the style. Decoration was influenced by [[Art in Ancient Greece|Greek]], [[Etruscan art|Etruscan]] and [[Scythian art]].{{sfn|Onians|2004|pp=30\u201331}}\n\n==Ancient art==\n{{Main|Ancient art}}\n[[File:Gudea of Lagash Girsu.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Statues of Gudea|Statue of Gudea I]]'', dedicated to the god Ningishzida; 2120&nbsp;BC (the [[Neo-Sumerian]] period); [[diorite]]; height: 46 cm, width: 33 cm, depth: 22.5 cm; [[Louvre]]]]\nIn the first period of recorded history, art coincided with [[writing]]. The great civilizations of the [[Near East]]: [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] and [[Mesopotamia]] arose. Globally, during this period the first great cities appeared near major rivers: the [[Nile]], [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]], [[Indus]] and [[Yellow River|Yellow]] Rivers.\n\nOne of the great advances of this period was writing, which was developed from the tradition of communication using pictures. The first form of writing were the [[Jiahu symbols]] from neolithic China, but the first true writing was [[cuneiform script]], which emerged in Mesopotamia c. 3500&nbsp;BC, written on [[clay]] tablets. It was based on [[Pictogram|pictographic]] and [[Ideogram|ideographic]] elements, while later Sumerians developed [[syllable]]s for writing, reflecting the [[phonology]] and [[syntax]] of the [[Sumerian language]]. In Egypt [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphic writing]] was developed using pictures as well, appearing on art such as the [[Narmer Palette]] (3,100&nbsp;BC). The [[Indus Valley Civilization]] sculpted seals with short texts and decorated with representations of animals and people. Meanwhile, the [[Olmecs]] sculpted [[Olmec colossal heads|colossal heads]] and decorated other sculptures with [[Olmecs#Writing|their own hierglyphs]]. In these times, writing was accessible only for the elites.\n\n===Ancient Near East===\n{{Main|Mesopotamian art}}\n[[Mesopotamian art]] was developed in the area between [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] Rivers in modern-day Syria and Iraq, where since the 4th millennium BC many different cultures existed such as [[Sumer]], [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]], [[Amorite]] and [[Chaldea]]. [[Architecture of Mesopotamia|Mesopotamian architecture]] was characterized by the use of [[brick]]s, [[lintel (architecture)|lintels]], and [[cone mosaic]]. Notable are the [[ziggurat]]s, large [[temple]]s in the form of [[step pyramid]]s. The tomb was a chamber covered with a false [[dome]], as in some examples found at [[Ur]]. There were also [[palace]]s walled with a terrace in the form of a ziggurat, where gardens were an important feature. The [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon]] was one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]].\n\n[[Relief]] sculpture was developed in [[wood carving|wood]] and [[stone]]. Sculpture depicted religious, military, and hunting scenes, including both human and animal figures. In the [[Sumer]]ian period, small statues of people were produced. These statues had an angular form and were produced from colored stone. The figures typically had bald head with hands folded on the chest. In the Akkadian period, statues depicted figures with long hair and beards, such as the [[stele]] of [[Naram-Sin of Akkad|Naram-Sin]]. In the Amorite period (or Neosumerian), statues represented kings from [[Gudea]] of [[Lagash]], with their mantle and a turban on their heads and their hands on their chests. During Babylonian rule, the stele of [[Hammurabi]] was important, as it depicted the great king Hammurabi above a written copy of the laws that he introduced. Assyrian sculpture is notable for its [[anthropomorphism]] of cattle and the [[winged genie]], which is depicted flying in many reliefs depicting war and hunting scenes, such as in the [[Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III|Black Obelisk]] of [[Shalmaneser III]].<ref>Azc\u00e1rate (1983), pp. 36\u201344.</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nStanding male worshiper MET DT850.jpg|Standing male worshipper, one of the twelve statues in the [[Tell Asmar Hoard]]; 2900-2600 BC; gypsum alabaster, shell, black limestone and bitumen; 29.5 \u00d7 12.9 \u00d7 10&nbsp;cm; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]\nSumerian Statues from Eshnunna and Khafajah of Diyala region, Iraq Museum.jpg|Sumerian Statues of worshippers (males and females); 2800-2400 BC ([[Early Dynastic Period (Mesopotamia)|Early Dynastic period]]); [[National Museum of Iraq]] ([[Baghdad]])\nBull's head ornament for a lyre MET DP260070.jpg|Bull's head ornament from a lyre; 2600-2350 BC; bronze inlaid with shell and [[lapis lazuli]]; height: 13.3&nbsp;cm, width: 10.5&nbsp;cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\nRaminathicket2.jpg|A ''[[Ram in a Thicket]]''; 2600\u20132400 BC; gold, copper, shell, [[lapis lazuli]] and [[limestone]]; height: 45.7&nbsp;cm (1&nbsp;ft 6 in.); [[British Museum]] (London)\nDenis Bourez - British Museum, London (8747049029) (2).jpg|The ''[[Standard of Ur]]''; 1600\u20131400 BC (the Early Dynastic Period III); shell, red limestone and lapis lazuli on wood; height: 21.7&nbsp;cm, length: 50.4&nbsp;cm; discovered at the [[Royal Cemetery at Ur]] ([[Dhi Qar Governorate]], Iraq); British Museum\nEbih-Il Louvre AO17551 n01.jpg|The ''[[Statue of Ebih-Il]]''; c. 2400 BC; [[gypsum]], [[schist]], shells and lapis lazuli; height: 52.5&nbsp;cm; [[Louvre]] (Paris)\nSumerian Cylinder Seal of King Ur-Nammu.jpg|Seal of Hash-hamer, showing enthroned king [[Ur-Nammu]], with modern impression; circa 2100 BC; greenstone; height: 5.3&nbsp;cm; [[British Museum]] (London)\nGenie benisseur (3565923284).jpg|[[Assyria]]n relief with a [[winged genie]] with [[bucket and cone]]; 713-706 BC; height: 3.3 m, width: 2.1 m; Louvre\n</gallery>\n\n===Egypt===\n{{Main|Ancient Egyptian art}}\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align = left\n| total_width = 650\n| direction = horizontal\n| footer =\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1 = \n}}\nOne of the first great civilizations arose in [[Egypt]], which had elaborate and complex works of art produced by professional artists and craftspeople. Egypt's art was religious and symbolic. Given that the culture had a highly centralized power structure and hierarchy, a great deal of art was created to honour the [[pharaoh]], including great monuments. Egyptian art and culture emphasized the religious concept of immortality. Later Egyptian art includes [[Coptic art|Coptic]] and [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] art.\n\nThe [[Ancient Egyptian architecture|architecture]] is characterized by monumental structures, built with large stone blocks, lintels, and solid [[column]]s. Funerary monuments included [[mastaba]], tombs of rectangular form; [[pyramid]]s, which included step pyramids ([[Saqqarah]]) or smooth-sided pyramids ([[Giza]]); and the [[hypogeum]], underground tombs ([[Valley of the Kings]]). Other great buildings were the [[temple]], which tended to be monumental complexes preceded by an avenue of [[sphinx]]es and [[obelisk]]s. Temples used [[pylon (architecture)|pylons]] and [[trapezoid]] walls with [[hypaethros]] and [[hypostyle]] halls and [[shrine]]s. The temples of [[Karnak]], [[Luxor]], [[Philae]] and [[Edfu]] are good examples. Another type of temple is the [[rock temple]], in the form of a [[hypogeum]], found in [[Abu Simbel]] and [[Deir el-Bahari]].\n\nPainting of the Egyptian era used a juxtaposition of overlapping planes. The images were represented hierarchically, i.e., the Pharaoh is larger than the common subjects or enemies depicted at his side. Egyptians painted the outline of the head and limbs in profile, while the torso, hands, and eyes were painted from the front. [[Applied arts]] were developed in Egypt, in particular [[Cabinet making|woodwork]] and [[Goldsmith|metalwork]]. There are superb examples such as [[cedrus|cedar]] furniture [[Inlay|inlaid]] with [[ebony]] and [[ivory]] which can be seen in the tombs at the [[Egyptian Museum]]. Other examples include the pieces found in [[Tutankhamun]]'s tomb, which are of great artistic value.<ref>Azc\u00e1rate (1983), pp. 29\u201334.</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nPrincess Nefertiabet before her meal-E 15591-IMG 9645-gradient.jpg|Stele of Princess [[Nefertiabet]] eating; 2589\u20132566 BC; limestone & paint; height: 37.7&nbsp;cm, length: 52.5&nbsp;cm, depth: 8.3&nbsp;cm; from [[Giza]]; [[Louvre]] (Paris)\nPectoral and Necklace of Sithathoryunet with the Name of Senwosret II MET DT531.jpg|Pectoral and necklace of Princess [[Sithathoriunet]]; 1887\u20131813 BC; gold, [[carnelian]], [[lapis lazuli]], [[turquoise]], [[garnet]] & [[feldspar]]; height of the pectoral: 4.5&nbsp;cm (1{{fraction|3|4}} in.); [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\nFile:Statuette of the lady Tiye MET DT221869.jpg|Statuette of the lady [[Tiye]]; 1390-1349 BC; wood, [[carnelian]], gold, glass, [[Egyptian blue]] and paint; height: 24&nbsp;cm (9{{fraction|7|8}} in.); [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\nCairoEgMuseumTaaMaskMostlyPhotographed.jpg|The ''[[Mask of Tutankhamun]]''; {{circa|1327 BC}}; gold, glass and semi-precious stones; height: 54&nbsp;cm ; [[Egyptian Museum]] ([[Cairo]])\nNofretete Neues Museum.jpg|The ''[[Nefertiti Bust]]''; 1352\u20131332 BC; painted [[limestone]]; height: 50&nbsp;cm; [[Neues Museum]] ([[Berlin]], Germany)\nAbu Simbel Temple May 30 2007.jpg|The entrance of [[Abu Simbel temples#The Great Temple|the Great Temple]] of the [[Abu Simbel temples]], founded around 1264 BC\n\u0421\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0433\u043e\u043d\u0447\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u041f\u0435\u043f\u0438.jpg|Stela of [[Pepi I Meryre|Pepi]], chief of the potters; 8th century BC; painted limestone; [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]] ([[Sankt Petersburg]], Russia)\nLepsius-Projekt tw 1-2-108.jpg|Illustration of various types of capitals, drawn by the egyptologist [[Karl Richard Lepsius]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Indus Valley Civilisation/Harappan===\n{{main|Indus Valley Civilisation#Arts and crafts}}\n{{see also|Mehrgarh}}\n[[File:Dancing girl of Mohenjo-daro.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''[[Dancing Girl (sculpture)|Dancing Girl]]''; 2400\u20131900 BC; bronze; height: 10.8 cm (4{{fraction|1|4}} in.); [[National Museum, New Delhi|National Museum]] ([[New Delhi]], India)]]\nDiscovered long after the contemporary civilizations of [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Egypt]], the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] or Harappan civilization (c. 2400\u20131900 BC) is now recognized as extraordinally advanced, comparable in many ways with those cultures.\n\nVarious sculptures, seals, bronze vessels [[Indian Pottery|pottery]], gold jewellery, and anatomically detailed figurines in [[terracotta]], bronze, and steatite have been found at excavation sites.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Ancient Indus Valley: New Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1AJO2A-CbccC|first=Jane|last=McIntosh|page=248|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-907-2|year=2008}}</ref>\n\nA number of gold, terracotta and stone figurines of girls in dancing poses reveal the presence of some dance form.

In the [[Shang dynasty]] (c. 1600\u20131050 BC), the supreme deity was [[Shangdi]], but aristocratic families preferred to contact the spirits of their ancestors. They prepared elaborate banquets of food and drink for them, heated and served in [[Chinese ritual bronzes|bronze ritual vessels]]. Bronze vessels were used in religious rituals to cement Dhang authority, and when the Shang capital fell, around 1050 BC, its conquerors, the Zhou (c. 1050\u2013156 BC), continued to use these containers in religious rituals, but principally for food rather than drink. The Shang court had been accused of excessive drunkenness, and the Zhou, promoting the imperial [[Tian]] (\"Heaven\") as the prime spiritual force, rather than ancestors, limited wine in religious rites, in favour of food. The use of ritual bronzes continued into the early [[Han dynasty]] (206 BC\u2013220 AD).\n\nOne of the most commonly used motifs was the ''[[taotie]]'', a stylized face divided centrally into 2 almost mirror-image halves, with nostrils, eyes, eyebrows, jaws, cheeks and horns, surrounded by incised patterns. Whether ''taotie'' represented real, mythological or wholly imaginary creatures cannot be determined.\n\nThe enigmatic bronzes of [[Sanxingdui]]. near [[Guanghan]] (in [[Sichuan province]]), are evidence for a mysterious sacrificial religious system unlike anything elsewhere in [[ancient China]] and quite different from the art of the contemporaneous Shang at [[Anyang]]. Excavations at Sanxingdui since 1986 have revealed 4 pits containing artefacts of [[bronze]], [[jade]] and [[gold]]. There was found a great bronze statue of a human figure which stands on a plinth decorated with abstract elephant heads. Besides the standing figure, the first 2 pits contained over 50 bronze heads, some wearing headgear and 3 with a frontal covering of [[gold leaf]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nBronze Standing Figure.jpg|Standing statue of a king and shaman leader; c. 1200\u20131000 BC; probably bronze; total height: 2.62 m; [[Sanxingdui Museum]] ([[Guanghan]], [[Sichuan]] province, China)\nHouMuWuDingFullView.jpg|''[[Houmuwu ding]]'', the largest ancient bronze ever found; 1300\u20131046 BC; bronze; [[National Museum of China]] (Beijing)\nMET DP219959.jpg|Altar set; late 11th century BC; bronze; overall (table): height: 18.1&nbsp;cm, width: 46.4&nbsp;cm, depth: 89.9&nbsp;cm; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\nPOL 3596-Editar (15708757686).jpg|One of the warriors of the ''[[Terracotta Army]]'', a famous collection of terracotta sculptures depicting the armies of [[Qin Shi Huang]], the first [[Emperor of China]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Greek===\n{{main|Ancient Greek art}}\n\nEven in antiquity, the arts of Greece were recognised by other cultures as pre-eminent. The Latin poet [[Horace]], writing in the age of [[Roman Empire|Roman]] emperor [[Augustus]] (1st century BC to 1st century AD), famously remarked that although conquered on the battlefield, `captive Greece overcame its savage conqueror and brought the arts to rustic Rome.\u2019 The power of Greek art lies in its representation of the human figure and its focus on human beings and the anthropomorphic gods as chief subjects. The [[Classical Greece|Classical period]] (5th and 4th centuries BC), realism and idealism were delicately balanced. In comparison, work of the earlier Geometric (9th to 8th centuries BC) and Archaic (7th to 6th centuries BC) ages sometimes appears primitive, but these artists had different goals: naturalistic representation was not necessarily their aim. [[Roman art]] lover collected ancient Greek originals, Roman replicas of Greek art, or newly created paintings and sculptures fashioned in a variety of Greek styles, thus preserving for posterity works of art otherwise lost. Wall and panel paintings, sculptures and mosaics decorated public spaces and well-to-do private homes. Greek imagery also appeared on Roman jewellery, vessels of gold, silver, bronze and terracotta, and even on weapons and commercial weights. Since the [[Renaissance]], the arts of ancient Greece, transmitted through the [[Roman Empire]], have served as the foundation of Western art.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fortenberry|first1=Diane|title=THE ART MUSEUM |date=2017|publisher=Phaidon|isbn=978 0 7148 7502 6|page=25|url=|language=en}}</ref>\n\n====Pre-Classical====\n{{further|Cycladic art|Minoan art}}\n[[Greek art|Greek]] and [[Etruscan art|Etruscan]] artists built on the artistic foundations of Egypt, further developing the arts of sculpture, painting, architecture, and ceramics.

In the new styles, pattern was rigorously applied to shape, each decorative element subordinate to but enhancing the whole. Surfaces were adorned with triangles, lines and semicircles, and concentric circles made with a multiple brush attached to a compass. The ''meander'' (''[[Meander (art)|Greek key]]'') pattern was popular, as were chequerboards, diamonds, chevrons and stars. Geometric figures, whether painted or sculpted, conform to an abstract aesthetic.

It also refers to the art of ancient peoples whose language is uncertain, but have cultural and stylistic similarities with speakers of Celtic languages.\n\nCeltic art is a difficult term to define, covering a huge expanse of time, geography and cultures. A case has been made for artistic continuity in Europe from the [[Bronze Age]], and indeed the preceding [[Neolithic age]]; however archaeologists generally use \"Celtic\" to refer to the culture of the [[European Iron Age]] from around 1000 BC onwards, until the conquest by the Roman Empire of most of the territory concerned, and art historians typically begin to talk about \"Celtic art\" only from the [[La T\u00e8ne]] period (broadly 5th to 1st centuries BC) onwards.<ref>Megaws, for example; see their introductory section, where they explain the situation & that their article will only cover the La T\u00e8ne period.</ref>  Early Celtic art is another term used for this period, stretching in Britain to about 150 AD.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/research_projects/project_archive/technologies_of_enchantment.aspx |title=Technologies of Enchantment: Early Celtic Art in Britain |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120804214909/http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/research_projects/project_archive/technologies_of_enchantment.aspx |archive-date=2012-08-04 |publisher=[[British Museum]]}} It is also used by Jacobsthal; however the equivalent \"Late Celtic art\" for Early Medieval work is much rarer, and \"Late Celtic art\" can also mean the later part of the prehistoric period.</ref>  The [[Early Medieval]] art of Britain and Ireland, which produced the [[Book of Kells]] and other masterpieces, and is what \"Celtic art\" evokes for much of the general public in the English-speaking world, is called [[Insular art]] in art history.

A major monument is the [[Arch of Titus]], which was erected by the Emperor [[Titus]]. Scenes of Romans looting the Jewish [[temple in Jerusalem]] are depicted in low-relief sculptures around the arch's perimeter.\n\n[[Ancient Roman pottery]] was not a luxury product, but a vast production of \"fine wares\" in ''[[terra sigillata]]'' were decorated with reliefs that reflected the latest taste, and provided a large group in society with stylish objects at what was evidently an affordable price.

It has been speculated that the Olmecs derive in part from neighboring [[Mokaya]] or [[Mixe\u2013Zoque languages|Mixe\u2013Zoque]]. The Olmecs flourished during [[Mesoamerica]]'s [[Mesoamerican chronology|formative period]], dating roughly from as early as 1500 BC to about 400&nbsp;BC. Pre-Olmec cultures had flourished in the area since about 2500&nbsp;BC, but by 1600\u20131500&nbsp;BC, early Olmec culture had emerged, centered on the [[San Lorenzo Tenochtitl\u00e1n]] site near the coast in southeast Veracruz.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Olmecs : America's First Civilization|authorlink=Richard Diehl|last=Diehl|first=Richard A.|publisher=Thames and Hudson|year=2004|location=London|isbn=978-0-500-28503-9|pages=[https://archive.org/details/olmecsamericasfi0000dieh/page/9 9\u201325]|url=https://archive.org/details/olmecsamericasfi0000dieh/page/9}}</ref> They were the first Mesoamerican civilization, and laid many of the foundations for the civilizations that followed.\n\nThe Olmec culture was first defined as an art style, and this continues to be the hallmark of the culture.<ref name=\"Coe 2002, p. 62\">Coe (2002), p. 62.</ref> Wrought in a large number of media \u2013 jade, clay, basalt, and greenstone among others \u2013 much Olmec art, such as [[The Wrestler (sculpture)|''The Wrestler'']], is naturalistic.

Pre-Islamic [[Yemen]] produced stylized [[alabaster]] heads of great aesthetic and historic charm.  Most of the pre-Islamic sculptures are made of [[alabaster]].\n\n[[Archaeology]] has revealed some early settled civilizations in [[Saudi Arabia]]: the [[Dilmun]] civilization on the east of the Arabian Peninsula, [[Thamud]] north of the [[Hejaz]], and [[Kindah]] kingdom and [[Al-Magar]] civilization in the central of Arabian Peninsula.\nThe earliest known events in Arabian history are migrations from the peninsula into neighbouring areas.<ref>Philip Khuri Hitti (2002), History of the Arabs, Revised: 10th Edition</ref> In antiquity, the role of [[South Arabia]]n societies such as Saba ([[Sheba]]) in the production and trade of aromatics not only brought such kingdoms wealth but also tied the [[Arabian peninsula]] into trade networks, resulting in far-ranging artistic influences.\n\nIt seems probable that before around 4000 BC the Arabian climate was somewhat wetter that today, benefitting from a monsoon system that has since moved south.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} During the late fourth millennium BC permanent settlements began to appear, and inhabitants adjusted to the emerging dryer conditions. In south-west Arabia (modern [[Yemen]]) a moister climate supported several kingdoms during the second and first millennia BC. The most famos of these is [[Sheba]], the kingdom of the biblical [[Queen of Sheba]]. These societies used a combination of trade in spices and the natural resources of the region, including aromatics such as frankincense and myrrh, to build wealthy kingdoms. [[Ma'rib#Ancient|M\u0101rib]], the [[Sabaeans|Sabaean]] capital, was well positioned to tap into Mediterranean as well as Near Eastern trade, and in kingdoms to the east, in what is today [[Oman]], trading links with [[Mesopotamia]], [[Persia]] and even India were possible. The area was never a part of the [[Assyria]]n or [[Persian empire]]s, and even [[Babylon]]ian control of north-west Arabia seems to have been relatively short-lived. Later Roman attempts to control the region's lucrative trade foundered. This impenetrability to foreign armies doubtless augmented ancient rulers' bargaining power in the spice and incense trade.\n\nAlthough subject to external influences, south Arabia retained characteristics particular to itself.

Art historians have focused particularly closely on [[Mesoamerica]] during this early era, because a series of stratified cultures arose there that erected grand architecture and produced [[Mesoamerica#Political and religious art|objects of fine workmanship]] that are comparable to the arts of Western Europe.\n\n===Preclassic===\nThe art-making tradition of Mesoamerican people begins with the [[Olmec#Art|Olmec]] around 1400&nbsp;BC, during the [[Mesoamerican chronology#Preclassic Era|Preclassic era]]. These people are best known for making [[Olmec colossal heads|colossal heads]] but also carved [[jade]], erected monumental architecture, made small-scale sculpture, and designed mosaic floors. Two of the most well-studied sites artistically are [[San Lorenzo Tenochtitl\u00e1n]] and [[La Venta]]. After the Olmec culture declined, the [[Maya civilization]] became prominent in the region. Sometimes a transitional [[Epi-Olmec culture|Epi-Olmec]] period is described, which is a hybrid of Olmec and Maya. A particularly well-studied Epi-Olmec site is [[La Mojarra]], which includes hieroglyphic carvings that have been partially deciphered.\n\n===Classic===\n[[File:Mascara Dios Murcielago.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]] mosaic mask that represents a Bat god, made of 25 pieces of jade, with yellow eyes made of shell. It was found in a tomb at [[Monte Alban]]]]\nBy the late pre-Classic era, beginning around 400&nbsp;BC, the Olmec culture had declined but both Central Mexican and Maya peoples were thriving. Throughout much of the Classic period in Central Mexico, the city of [[Teotihuacan]] was thriving, as were [[Xochicalco]] and [[El Tajin]]. These sites boasted grand sculpture and architecture. Other Central Mexican peoples included the [[Mixtec#Language, codices, and artwork|Mixtecs]], the [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotecs]], and people in the [[Valley of Oaxaca]]. [[Maya art]] was at its height during the \"Classic\" period\u2014a name that mirrors that of [[Classical antiquity|Classical European antiquity]]\u2014and which began around 200 CE. Major Maya sites from this era include [[Copan]], where numerous stelae were carved, and [[Quirigua]] where the largest stelae of Mesoamerica are located along with [[zoomorphic]] altars. A complex [[writing system]] was developed, and [[Maya codices|Maya illuminated manuscripts]] were produced in large numbers on paper made from [[Bark (botany)|tree bark]]. Many sites [[Maya collapse|\"collapsed\"]] around 1000 CE.\n\n===Postclassic===\nAt the time of the [[Spanish conquest of Yucat\u00e1n]] during the 16th and 17th centuries, the Maya were still powerful, but many communities were paying tribute to [[Aztec society]]. The latter culture was thriving, and it included [[Aztec#Arts|arts]] such as sculpture, painting, and feather mosaics. Perhaps the most well-known work of Aztec art is the [[Aztec sun stone|calendar stone]], which became a national symbol of the state of [[Mexico]]. During the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]], many of these artistic objects were sent to Europe, where they were placed in [[cabinets of curiosities]], and later redistributed to Western art museums. The Aztec empire was based in the city of [[Tenochtitlan]] which was largely destroyed during the colonial era. What remains of it was buried beneath [[Mexico City]]. A few buildings, such as the foundation of the [[Templo Mayor]] have since been unearthed by archaeologists, but they are in poor condition.\n\n===Art in the Americas===\nArt in the Americas since the conquest is characterized by a mixture of indigenous and foreign traditions, including those of European, African, and Asian settlers. Numerous indigenous traditions thrived after the conquest. For example, the [[Plains Indians]] created [[quillwork]], [[beadwork]], [[winter count]]s, [[ledger art]], and [[tipi]]s in the pre-reservation era, and afterwards became assimilated into the world of Modern and Contemporary art through institutions such as the [[Santa Fe Indian School]] which encouraged students to develop a unique Native American style. Many paintings from that school, now called the Studio Style, were exhibited at the [[Philbrook Museum of Art]] during its Indian annual held from 1946 to 1979.\n\n===Aztec===\n{{main|Aztecs#Art and cultural production}}\n[[File:Maize Deity (Chicomecoatl) MET DT5110.jpg|thumb|225px|Maize deity ([[Chicomecoatl]]); 15th\u2013early 16th century; basalt; overall: 35.56 x 18.11 x 8.89 cm; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)]]\nArising from the humblest beginnings as a nomadic group of \"uncivilizated\" wanderers, the Aztecs created the largest empire in Mesoamerican history, lasting from 1427/1428 to 1521. Tribute from conquered states provided the economic and artistic resources to transform their capital [[Tenochtitlan]] (0ld [[Mexico City]]) into one of the wonders of the world. Artists from throughout mesoamerica created stunning artworks for their new masters, fashioning delicate golden objects of personal adornment and formidable sculptures of fierce gods.\n\nThe Aztecs entered the Valley of Mexico (the area of modern [[Mexico City]]) in 1325 and within a century had taken control of this lush region brimming with powerful city-states. Their power was based on unbending faith in the vision of their patron deity [[Huitzilopochtli]], a god of war, and in their own unparalleled military prowess.\n\nThe grandiosity of the Aztec state was reflected in the comportment of the nobility and warriors who had distinguished themselves in battle. Their finely woven and richly embellished clothing was accentuated by iridescent tropical bird feathers and ornate jewellery made of gold, silver, semi-precious stones and rare shells.\n\nAztec art may be direct and dramatic or subtle and delicate, depending on the function of the work. The finest pieces, from monumental sculptures to masks and gold jewellery, display outstanding craftsmanship and aesthetic refinement. This same sophistication characterizes Aztec poetry, which was renowned for its lyrical beauty and spiritual depth. Aztec feasts were not complete without a competitive exchange of verbal artistry among the finely dressed noble guests.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nXiuhtecuhtli (mask).jpg|The Mask of Xiuhtecuhtli; 1400\u20131521; cedrela wood, turquoise, pine resin, mother-of-pearl, conch shell, [[cinnabar]]; height: 16.8 cm, width: 15.2 cm; [[British Museum]] (London)\n\nMixtechi-aztechi, maschera di tezcatlipoca con mosaico in turchese, 1400-1521 circa, 0.JPG|The Mask of [[Tezcatlipoca]]; 1400\u20131521; turquoise, [[pyrite]], [[pine]], [[lignite]], human bone, deer skin, conch shell and [[agave]]; height: 19 cm, width: 13.9 cm, length: 12.2 cm; British Museum\n\nFile:Double headed turquoise serpentAztecbritish museum.jpg|[[Double-headed serpent]]; 1450\u20131521; [[cedro]] wood (''Cedrela odorata''), [[turquoise]], shell, traces of gilding & 2 resins are used as adhesive (pine resin and Bursera resin); height: 20.3&nbsp;cm, width: 43.3&nbsp;cm, depth: 5.9&nbsp;cm; British Museum\n\nCodex Borbonicus (p. 14).jpg|Page 12 of the [[Codex Borbonicus]], (in the big square): [[Tezcatlipoca]] (night and fate) and [[Quetzalcoatl]] (feathered serpent); before 1500; bast fiber paper; height: 38&nbsp;cm, length of the full manuscript: 142&nbsp;cm; [[Biblioth\u00e8que de l'Assembl\u00e9e nationale (Paris)|Biblioth\u00e8que de l'Assembl\u00e9e nationale]] (Paris)\n\nFile:1479 Stein der f\u00fcnften Sonne, sog.

Its greatest artistic flowering occurred during the seven centuries of the {{C|Mayan Classic Period|Classic Period}} (c. 200 to 900 CE). Ancient Maya art then went through an extended Post-Classic phase before the upheavals of the sixteenth century destroyed courtly culture and put an end to the Mayan artistic tradition. Many regional styles existed, not always coinciding with the changing boundaries of Maya polities. [[Olmec]]s, [[Teotihuacan]] and [[Toltec]]s have all influenced Maya art. Traditional art forms have mainly survived in weaving and the design of peasant houses.\n\nThe [[jade]] artworks count among the most wonderful works of art the Maya have left us. The majority of items found date back to the [[Maya Classic Era|Classic period]], but more and more artefacts dating back to the [[Preclassic Maya|Preclassic]] are being discovered. The earliest of these include simple, unadorned beads found in burials in [[Cuello]] ([[Belize]]) dating back to between 1200 and 900 BC. At the time, stone cutting was already highly developed among the [[Olmecs]], who were already working jade before the Maya. In [[Mesoamerica]], jade is found solely as [[jadeite]]; [[nephrite]], the other variety known as jade, does not exist there. However, in this area of Mesoamerica \"jade\" is a collective term for a number of other green or blue stones. Jade objects were placed in burials, used in rituals and, of course, as jewelry. As well as being used for beads, which were often strung together to make highly ornate pendants and necklaces, they were also used for ear spools, arm, calf and foot bands, belts, pectorals (chest jewelry), and to adorn garments and headdresses.\n\nAncient Maya art is renowned for its aesthetic beauty and narrative content. Of all the media in which Maya artists worked, their paintings on pottery are among the most impressive because of their technical and aesthetical sophistication. These complex pictoral scenes accompanied by hieroglyphic texts recount historic events of the Classic period and reveal the religious ideology upon which the Maya built a great civilization.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nCenser, Seated King MET DT4512.jpg|Seated king-shaped censer; 4th century; ceramic; height: 80 cm, width: 31.1 cm; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\n\nMaya jade plaque.jpg|Jade plaque of a Maya king; 400-800 (Classic period); height: 14&nbsp;cm, width: 14&nbsp;cm; found at [[Teotihuacan]]; [[British Museum]] (London)\n\nMonument 151 de Tonina, prisonnier, exposition \"Mayas\", Mus\u00e9e du Quai Branly, Paris.jpg|Statue depicting a bound prisoner; 600-900 AD; limestone; from [[Tonin\u00e1]] (Mexico); [[Mus\u00e9e du quai Branly \u2013 Jacques Chirac]] (Paris)\n\nFile:K'inich Janaab Pakal I v2.jpg|Portrait of K'inich Janaab Pakal I; 615\u2013683; stucco; height: 43&nbsp;cm; [[National Museum of Anthropology (Mexico)|National Museum of Anthropology]] (Mexico City)\n\nCodex-Style Vase with Mythological Scene MET DP-579-002.jpg|[[Maya ceramics|Codex-style vase]] with a mythological scene; 7th\u20138th century; cdramic; height: 19&nbsp;cm, diameter: 11.2&nbsp;cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nVessel, Throne Scene MET DT4514.jpg|Vessel with a throne scene; late 7th\u20138th century; ceramic; 21.59 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nYaxchilan Lintel 24.jpg|One of the Yaxchilan lintels, this one showing a bloodletting ritual performed by the king of Yaxchilan, and his wife, Lady K'ab'al Xook; 723\u2013726; limestone; height: 108 cm, width: 78 cm; British Museum\n\nFile:Maya Presentation of Captives Kimbell.jpg|Relief showing Aj Chak Maax presenting captives before ruler Itzamnaaj B'alam III of [[Yaxchilan]]; 22 August 783; limestone with traces of pigment; height: 1.15 m; [[Kimbell Art Museum]] ([[Fort Worth]], Texas, US)\n</gallery>\n\n=== Costa Rica and Panama ===\nLong considered a backwater of culture and aesthetic expression, Central America's dynamic societies are now recognized as robust and innovative contributors to the arts of ancient Americas. The people of pre-Columbian [[Nicaragua]], [[Costa Rica]] and [[Panama]] developed their own distinctive styles in spite of the region being a crossroads for millennia. Its peoples were not subsumed by outside influences but instead created, adopted and adapted al manner of ideas and technologies to suit their needs and temperaments. The region's isiosyncratic cultural traditions, religious beliefs and sociopolitical systems are reflected in unique artworks. A fundamental spiritual tenet was shamanism, the central principle of which decreed that in a trance state, transformed into one's spirit companion form, a person could enter the supranatural realm and garner special power to affect worldly affairs. Central American artists devised ingenious ways to portray this transformation by merging into one figure human and animal characteristics; the [[jaguar]], [[Snake|serpent]] and avian raport (falcon, eagle or vulture) were the main spirit forms.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nBird Pendant MET h1 1979.206.1138.jpg|Bird pendant; 1st\u20135th century; [[jadeite]]; height: 6.7&nbsp;cm, width: 1.9&nbsp;cm, depth: 4.7&nbsp;cm; from [[Costa Rica]]; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\nIntermediate Region, Panama, Conte style, 5th-10th Century - Pectoral (Chest Plaque) - 1952.459 - Cleveland Museum of Art.tif|Pectoral; 5th-10th century; gold alloy; overall: 25.1 x 26.7&nbsp;cm; from [[Sitio Conte]] ([[Panama]]); [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] ([[Ohio]], US)\nPanama, Parita style, 11th-14th century - Vessel- Turtle - 1998.30 - Cleveland Museum of Art.tif|Vessel shaped like a turtle's carapace; 11th-14th century; painted ceramic; overall: 22.9 x 29.2&nbsp;cm; from Panama; Cleveland Museum of Art\nDouble Bat-Head Figure Pendant MET DT935.jpg|Pendant with 2 bat-head worriors who carry spears; 11th\u201316th century; gold; overall: 7.62&nbsp;cm (3 in.); from the [[Chiriqui Province]] ([[Panama]]); Metropolitan Museum of Art\n</gallery>\n\n=== Colombia ===\n{{more information|Muisca art}}\n[[Gold]] \u2014 the perpetually brilliant metal of status, wealth and power \u2014 inspired the Spanish to explore the globe and was an essential accoutrement of prestige, authority and religious ideology among the people of Central America and Colombia.\n\nIn Colombia, gold was important for its relationship to thedivine force of the sun. It was part of a complex ideology of universal binary oppositions: male-female, light-dark, the earth and spirit worlds. Gold body adornments were cast in complex forms, their iconography communicating social, political and spiritual potency through portrayals of powerful shaman-rulers, lineage totems and supranatural protector spirits.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nCalima Animal-Headed Figure Pendant MET DT11629 (cropped).jpg|[[Calima culture#Yotoco culture|Yotoco]] animal-headed figure pendant; 1st\u20137th century; gold; height: 6.35&nbsp;cm; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\nLime Container (Poporo) MET DT1262.jpg|[[Quimbaya civilization|Quimbaya]] lime container; 5th\u20139th century; gold; height: 23&nbsp;c; Metropolitan Museum of Art\nMale Figure (tunjo) MET DP215691.jpg|[[Muisca]] male figure (''[[tunjo]]''); 10th\u2013mid-16th century; gold; height: 14.9&nbsp;cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\nFigure Pendant MET DT4860.jpg|[[Tairona]] pendant; 10th\u201316th century; gold; height: 14&nbsp;cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n</gallery>\n\n=== Andean regions ===\n{{Further|Chav\u00edn culture#Art|Paracas culture|Nazca culture|Moche culture#Material culture|Sican culture#Art and ideology|Tiwanaku#Structures|Inca empire#Arts and technology}}\nThe ancient civilizations of [[Peru]] and [[Bolivia]] nurtured unique artistic traditions, including one of the world's most aesthetically impressive fibre art traditions, seen on artifacts from clothing to burial shrouds to architectural embellishment. The origins of Andean civilization reach back before 3000 BC. Harnessing the challenging environments \u2013 which included the world's driest coastal desert, desolate windswept highlands and formidable mountains \u2013 Andean pre-Columbian people excelled in agriculture, marine fishing and animal husbandry. By 1800 BC ritual and civic buildings elevated on massive adobe platforms dominated the larger settlements, particularly in the coastal river valleys. Two of the first important cultures from this land are the [[Chav\u00edn culture|Chav\u00edn]] and the [[Paracas culture]].\n\nThe [[Moche culture|Moche]] controlled the river valleys of the north coast, while the [[Nazca culture|Nazca]] of southern [[Peru]] held sway along the coastal deserts and contiguous mountains, inheriting the technological advances \u2013 in agriculture and architecture \u2013 as well as the artistic traditions of the earlier [[Paracas culture|Paracas people]]. Both cultures flourished around 100\u2013800 AD. Moche pottery is some of the most varied in the world. The use of [[molding (process)|mold technology]] is evident. This would have enabled the mass production of certain forms. The Following the decline of the Moche, two large co-existing empires emerged in the Andes region. In the north, the [[Huari culture|Wari]] (or Huari) Empire. The Wari are noted for their stone architecture and sculpture accomplishments, but their greatest proficiency was ceramic. The Wari produced magnificent large ceramics, many of which depicted images of the [[Staff God]].\n\nThe Chim\u00fa were preceded by a simple ceramic style known as [[Sican culture#Early Sican|Sic\u00e1n]] (700\u2013900 AD) which became increasingly decorative until it became recognizable as Chim\u00fa in the early second millennium. The Chim\u00fa produced excellent portrait and decorative works in metal, notably gold but especially silver. The Chim\u00fa also are noted for their featherwork, having produced many standards and headdresses made of a variety of tropical feathers which were fashioned into bired and fish designs, both of which were held in high esteem by the Chim\u00fa.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nEstela Raimondi.JPG|The ''[[Raimondi Stela]]''; by [[Chav\u00edn culture]]; 5th-3rd century BC; granite; height: 1.95 (6&nbsp;ft. 6 in.); [[Museo Nacional de Arqueolog\u00eda, Antropolog\u00eda e Historia del Per\u00fa]] ([[Lima]], Peru)\n\nL\u00edneas de Nazca, Nazca, Per\u00fa, 2015-07-29, DD 49.JPG|Aerial photograph of one of the [[Nazca lines]], taken in July 2015.

What survived reveals complex societies whose people created art rich in mythological and spiritual meaning.\n\nThe [[Taino people]], who occupied the Caraibbean islands when the Spanish arrived, were agriculturalists whose society was centred on hereditary chiefs called ''[[cacique]]s''. Their towns included impressively constructed ceremonial plazas in which ball games were played and religious rituals carried on, linking their culture to that of the Maya from the [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]]. Much of Taino art was associated with shamanic rituals and religion, including a ritual in which a shaman or a ''cacique'' enters into a hypnotic state by inhaling the hallucinogetic ''[[cohoba]]'' powder. Sculptures representing the creator god Yocahu often depict a nude male figure in a [[squatting position]] with a slightly concave dish on top of his head, to hold the ''cohoba'' powder. Other figures (always male) stand rigidly frontal, the ostentatious display of their genitals apparently to the importance of fertility. The purpose of these rituals was communication with the ancestors and the spirit world. Chiefs and shamans (often the same person) sometimes interceded with spirit beings from a sculpted stool, or ''duho''.\n\nMeanwhile, the [[Marajoara culture]] flourished on [[Maraj\u00f3|Maraj\u00f3 island]] at the mouth of the [[Amazon River]], in Brazil. Archeologists have found sophisticated [[pottery]] in their excavations on the island. These pieces are large, and elaborately painted and incised with representations of plants and animals. These provided the first evidence that a complex society had existed on Maraj\u00f3. Evidence of [[mound building]] further suggests that well-populated, complex and sophisticated settlements developed on this island, as only such settlements were believed capable of such extended projects as major earthworks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Grann|first=David|title=The Lost City of Z: A Tale of Deadly Obsession in the Amazon|page=[https://archive.org/details/lostcityofztaleo00gran/page/315 315]|year=2009|isbn=978-0-385-51353-1|url=https://archive.org/details/lostcityofztaleo00gran/page/315}}</ref> The pottery that they made is decorated with abastract lines and spirals, suggesting that they probably consumed hallucinogetic plants.

Famous examples include [[totem pole]]s, [[transformation mask]]s, and canoes. In addition to woodwork, two dimensional painting and silver, gold and copper engraved jewelry became important after contact with Europeans.\n\nThe [[Eastern Woodlands]], or simply woodlands, cultures inhabited the regions of North America east of the [[Mississippi River]] at least since 2500 BC. While there were many regionally distinct cultures, trade between them was common and they shared the practice of burying their dead in earthen mounds, which has preserved a large amount of their art. Because of this trait the cultures are collectively known as the [[Mound builder (people)|Mound builders]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nSouthwest, Mogollon, Mimbres, Pre-Contact Period, 11th-12th century - Bowl with Pronghorn Antelope and Geometric Design - 1930.50 - Cleveland Museum of Art.tif|[[Mogollon culture|Mogollon]] bowl with a geometric design and a pronghorn [[antelope]]; 1000\u20131150; earthenware; diameter: 31.2&nbsp;cm, overall: 12.5 x 32&nbsp;cm; [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] ([[Ohio]], US)\nKwakwaka'wakw.

Historically, their preferred medium was [[walrus ivory]], but since the establishment of southern markets for Inuit art in 1945, [[Printmaking|prints]] and figurative works carved in relatively soft stone such as [[soapstone]], [[serpentinite]], or [[argillite]] have also become popular. The range of colors is cold, most encountered being: black, brown, grays, white and gray-blue.\n\nThe [[Winnipeg Art Gallery]] has a large public collection of contemporary Inuit art.<ref>[https://www.wag.ca/about/facts/history History \u2013 Winnipeg Art Gallery]</ref> In 2007, the [[Museum of Inuit Art]] opened in [[Toronto]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.miagallery.ca/ |title=Museum of Inuit Art |access-date=2020-01-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180422032528/http://www.miagallery.ca/ |archive-date=2018-04-22 |url-status=dead }}</ref> but closed due to lack of resources in 2016.<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/canadian-museum-of-inuit-art-closing-1.3541737 'Small but mighty' Canadian Museum of Inuit Art closing its doors]</ref> Carvings Nunavut, owned by Inuk Lori Idlout, opened in 2008 and has grown to have the largest private collection in Nunavut.

One approach to [[Eastern art history]] divides the field by nation, with foci on [[Indian art]], [[Chinese art]], and [[Japanese art]]. Due to the size of the continent, the distinction between Eastern Asia and Southern Asia in the context of arts can be clearly seen. In most of Asia, pottery was a prevalent form of art. The pottery is often decorated with geometric patterns or abstract representations of animals, people or plants. Other very widespread forms of art were, and are, sculpture and painting.\n\n=== Central Asia ===\n{{main|Central Asia#Arts|Steppes art}}\nSuperb samples of [[Steppes art]] \u2013 mostly golden jewellery and trappings for horse \u2013 are found over vast expanses of land stretching from [[Hungary]] to [[Mongolia]]. Dating from the period between the 7th and 3rd centuries BC, the objects are usually diminutive, as may be expected from nomadic people always on the move. Art of the steppes is primarily an [[animal style|animal art]], i.e., combat scenes involving several animals (real or imaginary) or single animal figures (such as golden stags) predominate. The best known of the various peoples involved are the [[Scythians]], at the European end of the steppe, who were especially likely to bury gold items.\n\nAmong the most famous finds was made in 1947, when the Soviet archaeologist [[Sergei Rudenko]] discovered a royal burial at [[Pazyryk burials|Pazyryk]], [[Altay Mountains]], which featured \u2013 among many other important objects \u2013 the most ancient extant [[pile rug]], probably made in Persia.  Unusually for prehistoric burials, those in the northern parts of the area may preserve organic materials such as wood and textiles that normally would decay. Steppes people both gave and took influences from neighbouring cultures from Europe to China, and later Scythian pieces are heavily influenced by ancient Greek style, and probably often made by Greeks in Scythia.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nFinial (Kulan) LACMA M.76.97.603.jpg|Final (kulan); 6th-5th century BC; bronze; 14.5 x 9&nbsp;cm; [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] (US)\nDress ornament MET DT5051.jpg|[[Scythia]]n dress ornaments; 5th century BC; gold; height: 2.54&nbsp;cm; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\nStatua di guerriero, dalla regione di Kosh-Agach, Altai, VIII-X sec.JPG|Warrior statue; 8th-10th century; from the [[Kosh-Agach]] region ([[Altai Republic|Altai]]); [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]] ([[Sankt Petersburg]], Russia)\nCeremonial hanging IMA 50671.jpg|''Suzani'' (ceremonial hanging); late 1700s; cotton; 92 x 63; from [[Uzbekistan]]; [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]] (US)\n</gallery>\n\n===Indian===\n{{main|Indian art}}\nEarly [[Buddhists]] in India developed symbols related to [[Buddha]].  The major survivals of Buddhist art begin in the period after the [[Mauryan Empire|Mauryans]], with in North India [[Kushan Empire|Kushan art]], the [[Greco-Buddhist art]] of [[Gandhara]] and finally the \"classic\" period of [[Gupta art]].  Good quantities of sculpture survives from some key sites such as [[Sanchi]], [[Bharhut]] and [[Amaravati Marbles|Amaravati]], some of which remain ''in situ'', with others in museums in India or around the world. Stupas were surrounded by ceremonial fences with four profusely carved [[torana]]s or ornamental gateways facing the cardinal directions. These are in stone, though clearly adopting forms developed in wood. They and the walls of the stupa itself can be heavily decorated with reliefs, mostly illustrating the lives of the Buddha. Gradually life-size figures were sculpted, initially in deep relief, but then free-standing.<ref>Harle, 26\u201347, 105\u2013117</ref> [[Mathura art]] was the most important centre in this development, which applied to Hindu and Jain art as well as Buddhist.<ref>Harle, 59\u201370</ref>  The facades and interiors of rock-cut ''[[chaitya]]'' prayer halls and monastic ''[[vihara]]s'' have survived better than similar free-standing structures elsewhere, which were for long mostly in wood. The caves at [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]], [[Karla Caves|Karle]], [[Bhaja Caves|Bhaja]] and elsewhere contain early sculpture, often outnumbered by later works such as iconic figures of the Buddha and [[bodhisattva]]s, which are not found before 100 AD at the least.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nHead and chest of a lion-66.233-IMG 5523.JPG|Head and chest of a lion; circa 5th century; [[sandstone]]; height: 61 cm, width: 35.6 cm; [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts]] ([[Boston]], US)\n\nBuddha in Sarnath Museum (Dhammajak Mutra).jpg|Seated Buddha; circa 475; sandstone; height: 1.6 m; [[Sarnath Museum]] (India)\n\nFile:Shrine with Four Jinas (Rishabhanatha (Adinatha)), Parshvanatha, Neminatha, and Mahavira) LACMA M.85.55 (1 of 4).jpg|''Chaumukha'' idol; circa 600; sandstone; 58.42 x 43.18 x 44.45 cm; [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] (US)\n\nFile:022 Cave 1, Padmapani (33896247830).jpg|''Bodhisattva Padmapani''; 450\u2013490; pigments on rock; height: circa 1.2 m; [[Ajanta Caves]] (India)\n\n\nFour-headed god Harihara, Kashmir, 9th century AD, soapstone - Ethnological Museum, Berlin - DSC01606.JPG|Four-headed god [[Harihara]]; 9th century; [[soapstone]]; from [[Kashmir]] (India); [[Ethnological Museum of Berlin]] (Germany)\n\nBodhisattva Lokeshvara Museum Rietberg RVI 106.jpg|[[Bodhisattva]] Lokeshvara (as \"Lord of the World\"); 9th century; [[basalt]]; [[Rietberg Museum]] ([[Z\u00fcrich]], Switzerland)\n\nIndia, Bihar, 10th century - Model of the Sikhara of a Buddhist Temple - 1971.167 - Cleveland Museum of Art.tif|Model of the [[sikhara]] of a Buddhist temple; 900s; [[kaolinite]]; 28 x 9 x 9 cm; [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] ([[Cleveland]], USA)\n\nMET DT240.jpg|''[[Nataraja]]''; circa 11th century; copper alloy; height: 68.3&nbsp;cm, diameter: 56.5&nbsp;cm; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\n\nGanesha Museum Rietberg.jpg|Statue of [[Ganesh]]; 11th century; sandstone; Rietberg Museum\n\nElephant Hunt of Maharaja Anup Singh of Bikaner - Google Art Project.jpg|Elephant hunt of Maharaja Anup Singh of Bikaner; 1690\u20131700; opaque watercolor, gold and silver on paper; height: 31.1 cm, width: 39.4 cm; [[Cincinnati Art Museum]] ([[Cincinnati]], US)\n\nPortrait of Shah Jahan on the Peacock Throne.jpg|Portrait of Shah Jahan on the Peacock Throne; 19th century; height of the page: 37.2&nbsp;cm, height of the painting: 16.5&nbsp;cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nIndia, Bundi, 19th century - Painted Door - 1977.60.2 - Cleveland Museum of Art.jpg|Painted door; 1815; color on wood; overall: 190 x 88.9 x 43.7 cm; Cleveland Museum of Art\n</gallery>\n\n=== Nepalese, Bhutanese, and Tibetan ===\n{{Main|Newa art|Bhutanese art|Tibetan art}}\nFor more than a thousand years, [[Tibetan art]]ists have played a key role in the cultural life of Tibet. From designs for painted furniture to elaborate murals in religious buildings, their efforts have permeated virtually every facet of life on the [[Tibetan plateau]]. The vast majority of surviving artworks created before the mid-20th century are dedicated to the depiction of religious subjects, with the main forms being [[thangka]], [[distemper (paint)|distemper]] paintings on cloth, [[Tibetan Buddhist wall paintings]], and small statues in bronze, or large ones in clay, [[stucco]] or wood. They were commissioned by religious establishments or by pious individuals for use within the practice of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] and were manufactured in large workshops by monks and lay artists, who are mostly unknown.\n\nThe art of Tibet may be studied in terms of influences which have contributed to it over the centuries, from other [[Chinese art|Chinese]], [[Newa art|Nepalese]], [[Indian art|Indian]], and [[sacred art|sacred]] styles. Many bronzes in Tibet that suggest [[Pala Empire|Pala]] influence, are thought to have been either crafted by Indian sculptors or brought from India.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://himalayanbuddhistart.wordpress.com/2016/10/16/pala-india-maitreya-standing/ |title=Pala India, Maitreya \u2013 standing |date=October 16, 2016 |access-date=29 September 2018 |work=Himalayanbuddhistart |publisher=[[WordPress.com]]}}</ref>\n\n[[Bhutanese art]] is similar to the [[art of Tibet]]. Both are based upon [[Vajrayana|Vajrayana Buddhism]], with its pantheon of divine beings. The major orders of Buddhism in Bhutan are [[Drukpa Lineage|Drukpa Kagyu]] and [[Nyingma]]. The former is a branch of the [[Kagyu|Kagyu School]] and is known for paintings documenting the lineage of Buddhist masters and the 70 [[Je Khenpo]] (leaders of the Bhutanese monastic establishment). The Nyingma order is known for images of [[Padmasambhava]], who is credited with introducing Buddhism into Bhutan in the 7th century. According to legend, Padmasambhava hid sacred treasures for future Buddhist masters, especially [[Pema Lingpa]], to find. The [[Terton|treasure finders]] ([[Terton|''tert\u00f6n'']]) are also frequent subjects of Nyingma art.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nMET DP251650.jpg|Figurine; 14th\u201315th century; gilt-copper alloy; height: 13.5&nbsp;cm, width: 9.8&nbsp;cm; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\nAltar-piece from Nepal BM OA1927.6-13.1.jpg|Altar; 1700\u20131899; metal, stones and filigree; length: 130.7&nbsp;cm; [[British Museum]] (London)\nTibet, 18th century - Gorget - 1915.336 - Cleveland Museum of Art.jpg|Gorget; 18th century; silver; overall: 8.9&nbsp;cm, chain: 13.7&nbsp;cm; from Tibet; [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] ([[Cleveland]], US)\nMedicine Buddha painted mandala with goddess Prajnaparamita in center, 19th century, Rubin.jpg|Painted medicine Buddha [[mandala]] with goddess [[Prajnaparamita]] in center; 19th century; [[Rubin Museum of Art]] (New York City)\n</gallery>\n\n===Chinese===\n{{main|Chinese art}}\n{{see also|Chinese influences on Islamic pottery|Chinese Buddhist sculpture}}\n[[File:Ch'ien Hs\u00fcan 001.jpg|thumb|250px|''[[Wang Xizhi]] watching geese''; by [[Qian Xuan]]; 1235-before 1307; handscroll (ink, color and gold on paper); [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)]]\nIn Eastern Asia, painting was derived from the practice of calligraphy, and portraits and landscapes were painted on silk cloth. Most of the paintings represent landscapes or portraits. The most spectacular sculptures are the [[Chinese ritual bronzes|ritual bronzes]] and the bronze sculptures from [[Sanxingdui]]. A very well-known example of Chinese art is the ''[[Terracotta Army]]'', depicting the armies of [[Qin Shi Huang]], the first Emperor of China. It is a form of [[funerary art]] buried with the emperor in 210\u2013209 BC whose purpose was to protect the emperor in his afterlife.\n\nChinese art is one of the oldest continuous traditional arts in the world, and is marked by an unusual degree of continuity within, and consciousness of, that tradition, lacking an equivalent to the Western collapse and gradual recovery of classical styles. The media that have usually been classified in the West since the [[Renaissance]] as the [[decorative arts]] are extremely important in Chinese art, and much of the finest work was produced in large workshops or factories by essentially unknown artists, especially in [[Chinese ceramics]]. The range and quality of goods that decorated Chinese palaces and households, and their inhabitants, is dazzling. Materials came from across China and far beyond: gold and silver, [[mother of pearl]], ivory and rhinoceros horn, wood and [[lacquer]], [[jade]] and [[soap stone]], silk and paper.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nChang Xin Gong Deng, Han Dynasty,China (Hebei Museum).jpg|Changxin Palace lamp; circa 172 BC; bronze and gold; height: 48&nbsp;cm; [[Hebei Provincial Museum]] (China)\nWei Votivstele Museum Rietberg RCH 113.jpg|Votive stele with [[Buddha Shakyamuni]]; dated 542 ([[Eastern Wei Dynasty]]); limestone; [[Museum Rietberg]] ([[Z\u00fcrich]], Switzerland)\nChinese statuettes dancers-Ethno BHM 1946.261.1880-P6141157.jpg|Statuettes of dancers; 8th century ([[Tang Empire]]); ceramic; [[Historical Museum of Bern]] (Switzerland)\nCovered box with pavilion and figures, China, Yuan dynasty, 1300s AD, carved lacquer - Tokyo National Museum - Tokyo, Japan - DSC08285.jpg|Covered box with pavilion and figures; 1300s (the [[Yuan dynasty]]); carved lacquer; [[Tokyo National Museum]] (Tokyo)\nThe David Vases.jpg|The [[David Vases]]; 1351 (the Yuan dynasty); porcelain, cobalt blue decor under glaze; height: 63.8&nbsp;cm; [[British Museum]] (London)\nTwo flasks with dragons.jpg|Two flasks with dragons; 1403\u20131424; underglaze blue porcelain; height (the left one): 47.8&nbsp;cm, height (the right one): 44.6&nbsp;cm; British Museum\nMing Pilgerflasche Museum Rietberg U 138.jpg|Pilgrim flask decorated with peaches and pomegrenates, made with the [[cloisonn\u00e9]] technique; 1st half of the 17th century (the [[Ming Dynasty]]); Museum Rietberg\nDing Guanpeng - Peaceful Start for the New Year.jpg|''Peaceful Start for the New Year''; by [[Ding Guanpeng]]; 1748; ink and color on paper; height: 179.3&nbsp;cm; [[National Palace Museum]] ([[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]])\n</gallery>\n\n===Japanese===\n{{main|Japanese art}}\n[[File:Tosa Mitsuoki - Flowering Cherry and Autumn Maples with Poem Slips - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|450px|Flowering cherry and autumn maples with poem slips; by [[Tosa Mitsuoki]]; 1654\u20131681; pair of six-panel screens: ink, color, gold and silver on silk; height: 144 cm, width: 286 cm; [[Art Institute of Chicago]] ([[Chicago]], US)]]\n\n[[Japanese art]] covers a wide range of art styles and media, including [[J\u014dmon pottery|ancient pottery]], [[Japanese sculpture|sculpture]], [[Ink wash painting|ink painting]] and [[Japanese calligraphy|calligraphy]] on silk and paper, ''[[ukiyo-e]]'' paintings and [[woodblock printing|woodblock prints]], ceramics, [[origami]], and more recently [[manga]]\u2014modern Japanese [[cartoon]]ing and comics\u2014along with a myriad of other types.\n\nThe first settlers of Japan, the [[J\u014dmon]] people (c. 11,000\u2013300 BC). They crafted [[Jomon pottery|lavishly decorated pottery storage vessels]], clay figurines called ''[[dog\u016b]]''. Japan has been subject to sudden invasions of new ideas followed by long periods of minimal contact with the outside world. Over time the Japanese developed the ability to absorb, imitate, and finally assimilate those elements of foreign culture that complemented their aesthetic preferences. The earliest complex art in Japan was produced in the 7th and 8th centuries in connection with [[Buddhism]]. In the 9th century, as the Japanese began to turn away from China and develop indigenous forms of expression, the secular arts became increasingly important; until the late 15th century, both religious and secular arts flourished. After the [[\u014cnin War]] (1467\u20131477), Japan entered a period of political, social, and economic disruption that lasted for over a century. In the state that emerged under the leadership of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], organized religion played a much less important role in people's lives, and the arts that survived were primarily secular.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nFudo Myoo Museum Rietberg RJP 21.jpg|Fudo Myoo (Acala), king of mystical knowledge; late 12th century (Fujiwara period); cypress wood with remains of colored frame; [[Museum Rietberg]] ([[Z\u00fcrich]], Switzerland)\n\nJapan, Edo Period - Incense Guessing Game - 1921.405 - Cleveland Museum of Art.tif|Incense guessing game; 1615\u20131868; [[lacquer]]; overall: 23 x 25.4 x 16.6 cm; [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] ([[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], US)\n\nJapan, Kyoto, early 18th century - Noh Robe - 1916.1318 - Cleveland Museum of Art.tif|Robe; early 1700s; silk and brocaded metal thread; overall: 139.7 x 133.3 cm; Cleveland Museum of Art\n\nJapan, Okinawa Prefecture, Ryukyu Islands, Edo Period - Tiered Food Box with Stand - 1989.5 - Cleveland Museum of Art.tif|Tiered food Box with stand; late 18th century; red lacquer over a wood core, with litharge painting and engraved gold designs; overall: 53 x 68 cm; Cleveland Museum of Art\n\nKitagawa Utamaro - Toji san bijin (Three Beauties of the Present Day)From Bijin-ga (Pictures of Beautiful Women), published by Tsutaya Juzaburo - Google Art Project.jpg|''[[Three Beauties of the Present Day]]''; by [[Kitagawa Utamaro]]; circa 1793; height: 3.87&nbsp;cm (15.23&nbsp;in), width: 2.62&nbsp;cm (10.31&nbsp;in); [[Toledo Museum of Art]] ([[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]], [[Ohio]], US)\n\nFile:Japan, 19th century - Plate (Imari ware?) - 1991.1050 - Cleveland Museum of Art.tif|Plate; 1800s; overglaze enameled porcelain; diameter: 48.3 cm, overall: 5.7 cm; Cleveland Museum of Art\n\nInro-BHM 1079-P8260170.JPG|[[Inr\u014d]]; 19th century; wood, lacquer and gold; [[Historical Museum of Bern]] (Switzerland)\n\nMET 2015 300 189 F Burke.jpg|Painted folding fan; by [[Yamamoto Baiitsu]]; 1832; ink and color on paper; Image:17 \u00d7 47.5 cm; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\n</gallery>\n\n=== Korean ===\n{{main|Korean art}}\n\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align =\n| total_width = 500\n| direction = horizontal\n| footer = Royal [[seal (emblem)|seal]] with knob in the form of a turtle; late 16th\u201317th century; cast bronze with gilding; 6.98 x 15.24 x 15.24 cm; [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] ([[Los Angeles]], US)\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1 = Royal Seal with Knob in the Form of a Turtle LACMA M.2000.15.187 (1 of 6).jpg\n| width1 =\n| height1 =\n| alt1 =\n| caption1 = Front\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2 = Royal Seal with Knob in the Form of a Turtle LACMA M.2000.15.187 (3 of 6).jpg\n| width2 =\n| height2 =\n| alt2 =\n| caption2 = Inscription\n}}\n[[Korean art]]s include traditions in <!--(alphabetical:)-->calligraphy, music, painting and pottery, often marked by the use of natural forms, surface decoration and bold colors or sounds.\n\nThe earliest examples of Korean art consist of [[stone age]] works dating from 3000 BC.

The Korean art market is concentrated in the [[Insadong]] district of [[Seoul]] where over 50 small galleries exhibit and occasional fine arts auctions. Galleries are cooperatively run, small and often with curated and finely designed exhibits. In every town there are smaller regional galleries, with local artists showing in traditional and contemporary media. Art galleries usually have a mix of media.

Here live populations of widely diverse ethnic origins, speaking hundreds of different languages and existing at different stages of cultural evolution. With only a few exceptions, these peoples have been subjected in the course of their long histories to outside cultural influences of varying intensity from the [[Islamic world]], [[China]] and the West, as well as from India. Much of South-east Asian art is religious in nature. The penetration of Hindu and Buddhist influences from India has been especially profound in the mainland countries of [[Burma]], [[Thailand]], [[Cambodia]] and [[Laos]]. Chinese influences has been more limited, except [[Vietnam]], which was under Chinese hegemony from the 2nd century BC to the tenth century AD.\n\nEarly South-east Asian rulers built state temples to establish their legitimacy and give material expression to their power and authority. These were often decorated with relief sculptures of great vitality and originality, which nevertheless always conformed to established iconographic conventions for the depiction of Hindu and Buddhist themes.\n\nSouth-east Asian artists have long excelled at fresco painting and painting on lacquer, particularly in the Buddhist countries of the mainland and in Hindu [[Bali]]. Frescos and generally painted on the inner walls of the galleries surrounding temple enclosures, while painted lacquer is mainly applied to wooden objects: panels, cabinets, chests, doors and shutters. The subject matter of both forms of painting in generally confined to depictions of Hindu deities; stories from the Hindu epics, the ''[[Ramayana]]'' and the ''[[Mahabharata]]''; episodes from the life of the historical [[Buddha]] and tales of his previous lives (''[[jatakas]]''); and other Hindu and Buddhist themes.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nMET DP366477.jpg|Figurine; from Java (Indonesia); 9th century; bronze; height: 11.4&nbsp;cm; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\n\nVietnam Sitzende Gottheit Museum Rietberg RHI 402.jpg|Seated deity; late 9th; [[sandstone]]; from [[Champa]] ([[Quang Nam Province]], Temple Complex of Dong-du'o'ng); [[Rietberg Museum]] ([[Z\u00fcrich]], [[Switzerland]])\n\nFronton Cambodge Mus\u00e9e Guimet 9971.jpg|Tollitama pediment; from Cambodia; 976; pink sandstone; 196 x 269&nbsp;cm; [[Mus\u00e9e Guimet]] (Paris)\n\nSiva statue My Son.JPG|[[Shiva]] statue; 10-12th centuries; [[sandstone]]; height: 150 cm; Guimet Museum<ref>{{cite book|last1=Catherine Noppe|first1=Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Hubert|title=Art of Vietnam|date=|publisher=Parkstone Press Ldt|isbn=1 85995 860 5|page=106|url=|language=en}}</ref>\n\nPhra Malai Manuscript LACMA M.76.93.2 (20 of 21).jpg|A page of the [[Phra Malai|Phra Malai Manuscript]]; opaque watercolor and ink on paper; covers: gilded and lacquered paper; c. 1860\u20131880; 13.97 x 68.26 x 6.35&nbsp;cm; [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] (US)\n\nKain sarong prada from Indonesia, Peranakan, Honolulu Museum of Art 10480.1.JPG|Kain sarong prada (ceremonial skirt cloth); from Indramaya (Java, Indonesia); late 19th century; cotton, [[gold leaf]], plain weave, batik (resist dyed); [[Honolulu Museum of Art]] ([[Hawaii]], US)\n\nJava Maske Prabu Dewakusuma Museum Rietberg RIN 202.jpg|Mask of Prabu Dewakusuma, prince of Jenggala; circa 1890; painted wood; from eastern Java; Museum Rietberg\n\nBercerita dengan Wayang.jpg|[[Wayang]] Kulit, also known as Wajang Koelit, is a form of puppet theatre art found in Java, Indonesia and other parts of South-east Asia\n</gallery>\n\n==Africa==\n{{main|African art}}\n{{Further|Igbo art|Yoruba art|Benin art|Kuba art|Luba art}}\nAfrican art includes both [[African sculpture|sculpture]], typified by the brass castings of the [[Benin art|Benin people]], as well as [[African folk art|folk art]]. Concurrent with the European Middle Ages, in the eleventh century AD a nation that made grand architecture, gold sculpture, and intricate jewelry was founded in [[Great Zimbabwe]]. Impressive sculpture was concurrently being cast from brass by the [[Yoruba art|Yoruba people]] of what is now Nigeria. Such a culture grew and was ultimately transformed to become the [[Benin art|Benin Kingdom]], where elegant altar tusks, brass heads, plaques of brass, and palatial architecture was created. The Benin Kingdom was ended by the British in 1897, and little of the culture's art now remains in Nigeria.

Created for specific purposes, artworks can reveal their ongoing importance through physical transformations that enhance both their appearance and their potency. Many traditional African art forms are created as conduits to the spirit world and change appearance as materials are added to enhance their beauty and potency.

Scholars believe that this is likely because artists used perishable materials, such as wood and feathers, which did not survive in the tropical climate, and there are no historical records to refer to most of this material. The understanding of Oceania's artistic cultures thus begins with the documentation of it by Westerners, such as Captain [[James Cook]], in the eighteenth century. At the turn of the twentieth century the French artist [[Paul Gauguin]] spent significant amounts of time in Tahiti, living with local people and making modern art \u2014 a fact that has become intertwined with Tahitian visual culture to the present day.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} The indigenous [[Australian art|art of Australia]] often looks like abstract modern art, but it has deep roots in local culture.\n\nThe art of [[Oceania]] is the last great tradition of art to be appreciated by the world at large. Despite being one of the longest continuous traditions of art in the world, dating back at least fifty millennia, it remained relatively unknown until the second half of the 20th century.\n\nThe often ephemeral materials of Aboriginal art of Australia makes it difficult to determine the antiquity of the majority of the forms of art practised today. The most durable forms are the multitudes of rock engravings and rock paintings which are found across the continent. In the Arnhem Land escarpment, evidence suggests that paintings were being made fifty thousand years ago, antedating the Palaeolithic rock paintings of [[Cave of Altamira|Altamira]] & [[Lascaux]] in Europe.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nFigure MET DT1276.jpg|Head; 9th\u201311th century; vesicular [[basalt]]; height: 19.7&nbsp;cm, width: 15.5&nbsp;cm; from [[Hawaii]]; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\nMoai Rano raraku.jpg|''[[Moai]]''s at [[Rano Raraku]] (the [[Easter Island]]).

Many [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] states in Eastern Europe, as well as to some degree the [[Muslim world|Muslim]] states of the eastern [[Mediterranean]], preserved many aspects of the empire's culture and art for centuries afterward.\n\n[[Icon]]s (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u03b5\u1f30\u03ba\u03ce\u03bd}} ''eik\u014dn'' \"image\", \"resemblance\") are the most important visual elements in Byzantine religious practice, central to Orthodox worship since the end of [[Iconoclasm]] in the ninth century. Consistent in their format in order to preserve a sense of portraiture and the familiarity of favoured images, they have nevertheless transformed over time. An unusual characteristic of Byzantine art are the golden backgronds. Clear glass was often backed with [[gold leaf]]s to create a rich, shimmering effect.\n\nCarried by patriarchs in Eastern processions, read by monks in secluded caves and held by emperors at important ceremonies, sacred books, often beautifully illustrated, were central to Byzantine belief and ritual. Few manuscripts seem to have been produced in the Early Byzantine period between the sixth and eighth centuries CE, but there was a flourishing of painted books in the ninth century, following the end of Iconoclasm.\n\nJewelry, worn by men, women and children, was a clear indication of rank and wealth in Byzantine society. Styles varied from bold, heavy goldwork with striking large cabochon stones to extraordinarily delicate gold filigree and granulation. Ornament ranged from decorative patterning to floral and animal motifs to complex Christian iconography. Often jewellery was attached to ceremonial dress that did not often require cleaning. A popular technique from the 3rd to 7th centuries was ''opus interrasile'' or ''diatrita'', in which fine thin sheets of gold were pierced, creating a lace-like effect that is both beautiful and economical, as it reduces the weight of gold used. By the 5th century, stimulated by trade with the East, colored precious and semi-precious stones, polished rather than cut, were incorporated. Decorative designs were picked out in gold priced work, highlighted in dark [[niello]] (a silver sulphide that contrasted to gold and silver) or, from the 9th century, depicted in [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fortenberry|first1=Diane|title=The Art Museum |date=2017|publisher=Phaidon|isbn=978 0 7148 7502 6|page=115|url=|language=en}}</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nMarble slap with relief representation of the Nativity.

The two periods of outstanding achievement were the 7th and 8th centuries, with the metalwork and jewellery from [[Sutton Hoo]] and a series of magnificent illuminated manuscripts, and the final period after about 950, when there was a revival of English culture after the end of the [[Viking]] invasions. By the time of the Conquest the move to the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] style is nearly complete.

However, the style neither began nor ended to neatly coincide with the rule of the dynasty.

The period saw a resurgence of monumental stone structures with complex structural programmes.\n\n[[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] churches are characterized by rigid articulation and geometric clarity, incorporated into a unified volumetric whole. The architecture is austere but enlivened by decorative sculpting of capitals and portals, as well as frescoed interiors. Geometric and foliate patterning gives way to increasingly three-dimensional figurative sculpture.\n\nFrom the mid-eleventh to the early thirteenth centuries, Romanesque paintings were two-dimensional, defined by bold, linear outlines and geometry, particularly in the handling of drapery; symmetry and frontality were emphasised. Virtually all Western churches were painted, but probably only a few wall painters were monks; instead, itinerant artists carried out most of this work. Basic blocking out was done on wet [[plaster]] with earth colours. A limited palette, dominated by white, red, yellow ochres and azure, was employed for maximum visual effect, with dense colouring forming a backdrop of bands, a practice that originated in late Classical art as an attempt to distinguish earth and sky.\n\nDuring the later eleventh and twelfth centuries, the great age of Western monasticism, Europe experienced unprecedented economic, social and political change, leading to burgeoning wealth among landowners, including monasteries. There was increasing demand for books, and economic wealth allowed many manuscripts to be richly [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminated]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nMaria Lach 02.jpg|''[[Maria Laach Abbey]]'' (near [[Andernach]], Germany), one of the most iconic Romanesque churches\nVezelay WLM2016 La basilique Sainte-Marie-Madeleine (3).jpg|Stone bas-relief of [[Jesus]], from the [[V\u00e9zelay Abbey]] ([[Burgundy]], France)\n\u00c9vangiles de Liessies - saint Jean - Avesnes-sur-Helpe.jpg|Miniature of [[Saint John the Evangelist]]; before 1147; illumination on parchment; 35.5&nbsp;cm; [[Avesnes-sur-Helpe]] (France)\nKlosterkirche M\u00fcstair Freske Steinigung Stephanus.jpg|The stoning of Saint Stephen; 1160s; fresco; height: 1.3 m; [[Saint John Abbey, M\u00fcstair|Saint John Abbey]] ([[Val M\u00fcstair]], [[Canton of Grisons]], Switzerland)\n</gallery>\n\n====Gothic====\n{{main|Gothic art}}\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | header    =\n | header_align = \n | header_background =\n | footer    = The ''[[Wilton Diptych]]''; 1395\u20131459; tempera and gold on panel; 53 x 37 cm; [[National Gallery]] (London)\n | footer_align = left/right/center\n | footer_background =\n | width     =\n | image1    = Wilton diptych; left-hand panel.jpg\n | width1    = 150\n | caption1  = \n | alt1      =\n | image2    = Wilton diptych; right-hand panel.jpg\n | width2    = 150\n | caption2  = \n | alt2      = }}\nGothic art developed in Northern France out of Romanesque in the 12th century AD, and led by the concurrent development of [[Gothic architecture]].

In the late 14th century, the sophisticated court style of [[International Gothic]] developed, which continued to evolve until the late 15th century.\n\nThe imposing Gothic cathedrals, with their sculptural programmes and stained glass windows, epitomize the Gothic style.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fortenberry|first1=Diane|title=The Art Museum |date=2017|publisher=Phaidon|isbn=978 0 7148 7502 6|page=149|url=|language=en}}</ref> It differs from Romanesque through its rib-shaped [[Vault (architecture)|vaults]], and the use of [[ogive]]s.

It has experienced from time to time westernising movements that culminated in the comprehensive reforms of [[Peter the Great]] (around 1700). From prehistoric times the material of vernacular Russian architecture was wood. [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine churches]] and the [[architecture of Kievan Rus]] were characterized by broader, flatter domes without a special framework erected above the drum. In contrast to this ancient form, each drum of a Russian church is surmounted by a special structure of metal or timber, which is lined with sheet iron or tiles. Russian architecture used the dome shape not only for churches but also for other buildings. Some characteristics taken from the Slavic pagan temples are the exterior galleries and the plurality of towers.\n\nThe use and making of icons entered [[Kievan Rus']] following its conversion to Orthodox Christianity from the Eastern Roman ([[Byzantine]]) Empire in 988 CE. As a general rule, these icons strictly followed models and formulas hallowed by usage, some of which had originated in Constantinople. As time passed, the Russians\u2014notably [[Andrei Rublev]] and [[Dionisius]]\u2014widened the vocabulary of iconic types and styles far beyond anything found elsewhere. The personal, improvisatory and creative traditions of Western European religious art are largely lacking in Russia before the seventeenth century, when [[Simon Ushakov]]'s painting became strongly influenced by religious paintings and engravings from Protestant as well as Catholic Europe.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nO98 Idol von Sbrutsch mit Darstellung von Unterwelt, Erde und des Himmels, zirka 10.

It is difficult, if not futile, to identify a single impetus for the changes that took place, but a number of factors contributed: a new awareness of antiquity and its distinctiveness, economic prosperity and a coincident sense of competition among patrons and artists, and a newfound awareness of the natural and secular world.  \n\nMedieval Europeans didn't perceive a fundamental difference between their own time and antiquity. People were largely indifferent to the scattered vestiges of the past around them, for ancient monuments were familiar to the point of being invisible. Some of these were seen as `marvels\u2019 because of their size or fine carving, but that only made them suspect. The [[Pantheon]] in Rome, for example, was said to have been built by demons, and it only survived because it was converted into a church.\n\nThe renewed attention to the past as distinct from the present and, more importantly, a desire to revive it, occurred in a series of waves. In the 13th century the [[Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman]] Emperor [[Frederick II]] (reign 1220-1250), who ruled southern Italy, sought to revive the glories of imperial Rome, including its arts. The sculptor [[Nicola Pisano]] learned his craft in that environment before moving north to [[Tuscany]] and inspiring local sculptors. In the 14th century the Italian poet [[Petrarch]] (1304-1374) postulated a definitive break between the golden age of antiquity and his own time of cultural decline. In the 15th century [[Leon Battista Alberti]] (1404-1472), in his treatise ''On Painting'', wrote of the talented artists of antiquity, in comparison to whom living painters and sculptors were `in no way inferior\u2019. This sense of distance inspired Italians to view the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] past with fresh eyes, to learn from the accomplishments of the ancients. Competition was also a crucial motivator, as cities, rulers and private individuals strove to outdo one another in their patronage of public and private artworks.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Fortenberry|first1=Diane|title=THE ART MUSEUM|date=2017|publisher=Phaidon|isbn=978 0 7148 7502 6|page=156|url=|language=en}}</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nPisa, battistero di San Giovanni (45).jpg|Pulpit; by [[Nicola Pisano]]; 1265\u20131268; marble; height: 4.6 m; [[Pisa Baptistery]] (Italy)<ref>{{cite book|last1=Fortenberry|first1=Diane|title=THE ART MUSEUM|date=2017|publisher=Phaidon|isbn=978 0 7148 7502 6|page=156|url=|language=en}}</ref>\n\nView of Santa Maria del Fiore in Florence.jpg|The ''[[Florence Cathedral]]'', built between 1296 and 1436 in [[Florence]] (Italy)\n\nVan Eyck - Arnolfini Portrait.jpg|''[[Arnolfini Portrait|The Arnolfini Portrait]]''; by [[Jan van Eyck]]; 1434; oil on panel; 82.2 x 60&nbsp;cm; [[National Gallery]] (London)\n\nFra Angelico - The Last Judgement (Winged Altar) - Google Art Project.jpg|''The Last Judgement''; by [[Fra Angelico]]; 1435\u20131450; poplar wood; 103 x 65.3 cm; [[Gem\u00e4ldegalerie, Berlin|Gem\u00e4ldegalerie]] (Berlin)\n\n'David' by Michelangelo Fir JBU002.jpg|''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]''; by [[Michelangelo]]; 1501\u20131504; marble; 517&nbsp;cm \u00d7 199&nbsp;cm; [[Galleria dell'Accademia]] (Florence)\n\nMona Lisa, by Leonardo da Vinci, from C2RMF retouched.jpg|''[[Mona Lisa]]''; by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]; c. 1503\u20131506, perhaps continuing until c. 1517; oil on poplar panel; 77&nbsp;cm \u00d7 53&nbsp;cm; [[Louvre]]\n\nThe Garden of Earthly Delights by Bosch High Resolution.jpg|''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]''; by [[Hieronymus Bosch]]; c. 1504; oil on panel; 2.2 x 1.95 m (7&nbsp;ft 2{{fraction|1|2}} in.) \u2013 central panel; [[Museo del Prado]] ([[Madrid]], Spain)\n\n\"The School of Athens\" by Raffaello Sanzio da Urbino.jpg|''[[The School of Athens]]''; by [[Raphael]]; 1509\u20131510; fresco; 5.8 x 8.2 m; [[Apostolic Palace]] ([[Vatican City]])\n\nBasin or bowl with Laura Bella MET DP326519.jpg|Basin or bowl with a lady named Laura Bella; circa 1510; maiolica (tin-glazed earthenware); overall: 6 \u00d7 27.3 cm; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\n\nThe Rhinoceros (NGA 1964.8.697) enhanced.png|''[[D\u00fcrer's Rhinoceros|The Rhinoceros]]''; by [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]]; 1515; woodcut; 23.5 cm \u00d7 29.8 cm; [[National Gallery of Art]] ([[Washington, D.C.]])\n\nAltar enframement MET DP271811.jpg|Italian altar enframement; circa 1530\u20131550; marble; height: 4.2 m, width: 3.3 m; probably from [[Tuscany]]; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nHans Holbein the Younger - The Ambassadors - Google Art Project.jpg|''[[The Ambassadors (Holbein)|The Ambassadors]]''; by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]]; 1533; oil on panel; 2.07 x 2.09; [[National Gallery]] (London)\n\nPharmacy bottle (one of a pair) MET DP320576.jpg|Pair of pharmacy bottles; circa 1550; maiolica (tin-glazed earthenware); overall: 38.4 \u00d7 24.9 \u00d7 21 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nCassone (chest), pair with 1975.1.1947 MET SLP1940-1.jpg|Cassone (chest); mid 16th century; walnut, carved and partially gilded, coniferous wood; height: 73.6 cm, width: 1.7 m, depth: 63.5 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nOval basin or dish with subject from Amadis of Gaul MET DP320592.jpg|Oval basin or dish with subject from Amadis of Gaul; circa 1559\u20131564; maiolica; overall: 6 \u00d7 67.3 \u00d7 52.4 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nBowl with Allegory of Peace MET DP316534.jpg|Bowl with an allegory of peace; 1561; maiolica; overall: 12.1 \u00d7 36.5 cm; circa Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nGiuseppe Arcimboldo - Summer - Google Art Project.jpg|''Summer''; by [[Giuseppe Arcimboldo]]; 1563; oil on panel; 67 x 50.8&nbsp;cm; [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] ([[Vienna]], Austria)\n\nPieter Bruegel the Elder - The Tower of Babel (Vienna) - Google Art Project.jpg|''[[The Tower of Babel (Bruegel)|The Tower of Babel]]''; by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]]; 1563; oil on panel: 1.14 x 1.55 cm; Kunsthistorisches Museum\n\nDresser (Dressoir aux harpies) MET DP105799.jpg|French dresser (dressoir aux harpies); circa 1570\u20131590; carved walnut with interior elements of oak, pine, and some iron accessories; height: 144.8 cm, width: 137.8 cm, depth: 50.8 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nInkstand with Apollo and the Muses MET DP320047.jpg|Inkstand with [[Apollo]] and the [[Muses]]; 1584; maiolica (tin-glazed earthenware); overall: 48.3 \u00d7 52.1 \u00d7 37.8 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n</gallery>\n\n===Baroque===\n{{main|Baroque}}\n{{Listen|type=music|filename=W.

The 17th century was a period of volatile change. Astronomical breakthroughs and scientific inventions such as the telescope and microscope were matched by developments in geography, exploration, natural history and philosophy. Religious upheaval added to the mix, as the Catholic Counter-Reformation contested the growing popularity of Protestant faith. During the Renaissance and Baroque eras, the highest goal of painting was to provide moral exemplars by depicting instructive events from literature, history and mythology. These works are known as history paintings. 17th century history painters were preoccupied with rendering emotion at the most significant moment of a story. This process involved the use of gesture and facial expressions to convey the `passion of the soul\u2019. This was often cimbined with a concern for narrative clarity and dramatic concentration, especially in the case of [[Nicolas Poussin]]. By such means painters intensified the dramatic impact of narrative scenes, as in Poussin's ''Abduction of the Sabine Women'', in which the horror and fear displayed by the women in contrasted with the aggression and determination of the men, resulting in images of power and terrible beauty.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Fortenberry|first1=Diane|title=THE ART MUSEUM|date=2017|publisher=Phaidon|isbn=978 0 7148 7502 6|page=243|url=|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn decorative and [[applied arts]], Baroque appeared first in the area of present-day [[Italy]], and spread in all Europe.

Frivolity was a virtue, and portrait painting was increasingly in demand in a society in which a charming likeness was an essential part of seduction. French Rococo developed during the [[R\u00e9gence]] (1715-1723), when [[Louis XV]] (reign between 1715 and 1774) was a child and the country was governed by [[Philippe d'Orl\u00e9ans]]. It grew out of the heavier Baroque style of the court of [[Louis XIV]], incorporating lighter elements, more delicate curves, asymmetry and playfulness.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fortenberry|first1=Diane|title=THE ART MUSEUM |date=2017|publisher=Phaidon|isbn=978 0 7148 7502 6|page=265|url=|language=en}}</ref> In decorative arts and architecture, it can be recognised by its huge quantity of curves and [[C]]-shaped [[volute]]s, lightness in colour and weight, or low relief work of ribbons, scrolls, shells, flower wreaths, birds and animals.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mattinson|first1=Lindsay|title=Understanding Architecture A Guide To Architectural Styles|date=2019|publisher=Amber Books|isbn=978-1-78274-748-2|page=95|url=|language=en}}</ref> In [[France]], it enters through the style known as [[Louis Quinze]], here being also known as Pompadour.

The house is one of the most beautiful 18th-century city mansions in Paris. It was built for the Prince and Princess of Soubise in 1375 and remodelled in 1704 under the instructions of [[Fran\u00e7ois, Prince of Soubise|Fran\u00e7ois de Rohan]], Prince de Soubise. The building, which is divided into two apartments - that of the Prince on the ground floor and that of the Princess on the upper floor, or ''piano nobile'' - features on both floors oval salons that overlook the garden. the salons were created between 1735 and 1739 by [[Germain Boffrand]], a pupil of the French architect [[Fran\u00e7ois Mansart]]. Boffrand softened the lines of the Salon Oval de la Princesse with sinuous curves, multiplying the mirror reflection. The walls melt into the vaults, and irregular niches for sculpture are separated by ''[[rocaille]]'' shells. Architecture, sculpture and painting combine to create a rich and harmonious atmosphere. Eight ceiling canvases painted by [[Charles-Joseph Natoire]] between 1737 and 1739 illustrate the story of [[Cupid and Psyche]]. Before his return from Italy in 1730, Natoire had spent several years in Rome at the Acad\u00e9mie de France, where he had studied the works of [[Paolo Veronese]], [[Antonio Correggio]] and, especially, [[Pietro da Cortona]], a 17th-century painted of decorative frescos. Their influence is evident in the supple and elegant compositions, the lighting effects, and the way the figures are adapted to the constraints of the decor. The palette of pinks, blues and greens creates a charming arcadian effect, encapsulating the mature Rococo.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fortenberry|first1=Diane|title=THE ART MUSEUM |date=2017|publisher=Phaidon|isbn=978 0 7148 7502 6|page=267|url=|language=en}}</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nStift Wilhering Kirche Orgel 01.jpg|The amazing interior of the [[Wilhering Abbey]] ([[Wilhering]], [[Austria]]).

People, commodities, ideas, and information could travel between countries and continents with unprecedented speed and these changes were reflected in the arts. The invention of photography in the 1830s further altered certain aspects of art, particularly painting. By the dawn of the 19th century, a long and gradual paradigm shift was complete, from the Gothic when artists were viewed as craftsmen in the service of the church and monarchies, to the idea of art for art's sake, where the ideas and visions of the individual artist were held in the high regard, with patronage from an increasingly literate, affluent, and urban middle and upper class population that had been emerging for 200 years (particularly in Paris and London). A dichotomy begin in the late 18th century between neoclassicism and romanticism that subdivided and continued to run through virtually every new movement in modern art: \"Spreading like waves, these \"isms\" defy national, ethnic, and chronological boundaries; never dominant anywhere for long, they compete or merge with each other in endlessly shifting patterns. \"<ref name=\"Janson (1977)\">Janson, H.

Conversely modern art has increasingly extended beyond western Europe. In Russia and the USA the arts were developing to a degree that rivaled the leading European countries by the end of the 19th century. Many of the major movements appeared in Latin America, Australia, and Asia too and geography and nationality became increasingly insignificant with each passing decade. By the 20th century important and influential artist were emerging around the world: e.g. [[Foujita]] (Japan), [[Arshile Gorky]] (Armenia), [[Diego Rivera]] and [[Frida Kahlo]] (Mexico), [[Wifredo Lam]] (Cuba), [[Edvard Munch]] (Norwegian), [[Roberto Matta]] (Chilean), [[Mark Rothko]] (Lithuanian-American), [[Fernando Botero Angulo]] (Colombia), [[Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i]] and [[Victor Brauner]] (Romania).<ref name=\"Starobinski (1964)\">Starobinski, Jean (1964) Art, Ideas, History: The Invention of Liberty 1700-1789.

One of the earliest expressions of  romanticism was in the [[English landscape garden]], carefully designed to appear natural and standing in dramatic contrast to the formal gardens of the time. The concept of the \"natural\" English garden was adopted throughout Europe and America in the following decades. In architecture, the romantics frequently turned to alternative sources other than the Greek and Roman examples admired by the neo-classicist. Romantic architecture often revived [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] forms and other styles such as exotic eastern models. The [[Palace of Westminster]] (Houses of  Parliament), London is an example of romantic architecture that is also referred to as [[Gothic Revival]].<ref name=\"Janson (1977)\" /> In painting romanticism is exemplified by the paintings of [[Francisco Goya]] in Spain, [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]] and [[Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault]] in France, [[William Blake]], [[Henry Fuseli]], [[Samuel Palmer]], and [[J. M. W.

Examples of sculptors of the romantic period include [[Antoine-Louis Barye]], [[Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux]], [[Auguste Pr\u00e9ault]], and [[Francois Rude]].

In nineteenth-century painting, the term Realism refers more to the subject matter depicted than to the style or technique. Realist paintings typically represent ordinary places and people engaged in everyday activities, as opposed to grand, idealized landscapes, mythological gods, biblical subjects, and historical figures and events that had often dominated painting in western culture. Courbet said \"I cannot paint an angel because I have never seen one\".<ref name=\"Janson (1977)\" /> Realism was also in part a reaction to the often dramatic, exotic, and emotionally charged work of romanticism. The term realism is applied relative to the idealized imagery of neo-classicism and the romanticized imagery of romanticism. Artists such as [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]] and [[Honor\u00e9 Daumier]] had loose associations with realism, as did members of the [[Barbizon School]], particularly [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet]], but it was perhaps [[Gustave Courbet]] who was the central figure in the movement, self identifying as a realist, advocating realism, and influencing younger artists such as [[\u00c9douard Manet]]. One significant aspect of realism was the practice of painting landscapes [[en plein air]] and its subsequent influence on [[impressionism]]. Beyond France, realism is exemplified by artists such as [[Wilhelm Leibl]] in Germany, [[Ford Madox Brown]] in England, and [[Winslow Homer]] in the United States. Art historian [[H. Harvard Arnason|H. H. Arnason]] wrote, \"The chronological sequence of neo-classicism, romanticism, and realism is, of course, only a convenient stratification of movements or tendencies so inextricably bound up with one another and with the preceding movements that it is impossible to tell where one ended and another began\",<ref name=\"Arnason (1977)\" /> and this becomes even more pertinent and complex as one follows all of the movements and \"isms\" into the late 19th and early 20th centuries.<ref name=\"Leymarie, Jean (1962)\">Leymarie, Jean (1962) French Painting, the Nineteenth Century.

C.

Starting in the late 1850s, several of the impressionists had made acquaintances and friendships as students in Paris, notably at the free [[Acad\u00e9mie Suisse]] and [[Charles Gleyre|Charles Gleyre's]] studio. Their progressive work was frequently rejected by the conservative juries of the prestigious [[Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts|Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux Arts]] salons, a forum where many artist turned to establish their reputations, and many of the young artist were included in a highly publicized, but much ridiculed [[Salon des Refus\u00e9s]] in 1863. In 1874 they formed the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme Coop\u00e9rative des Artistes Peintres, Sculpteurs, Graveurs, independent of the academy, and mounted the first of several impressionist exhibitions in Paris, through to 1886 when their eighth and final exhibition was held. Important figures in the movement included [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bazille]], [[Gustave Caillebotte]], [[Mary Cassatt]], [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]], [[Edgar Degas]], [[Armand Guillaumin]], [[\u00c9douard Manet]], [[Claude Monet]], [[Berthe Morisot]], [[Camille Pissarro]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], and [[Alfred Sisley]]. Although impressionism was primarily a movement of painters, Degas and Renoir also produced sculptures and others like [[Auguste Rodin]] and [[Medardo Rosso]] are sometimes linked to impressionism. By 1885 impressionism had achieved some prominence, and yet a younger generation were already pushing the limits beyond impressionism. Artist from [[Museum of Russian impressionism|Russia]], [[Heidelberg School|Australia]], [[American Impressionism|America]] and Latin America soon adopted impressionist styles. A few of the original impressionist continued producing significant work into the 1910s and 1920s.<ref name=\"Blunden & Blunden (1976)\">Blunden, Maria and Godfrey Blunden (1976) Impressionists and Impressionism.

Paintings were often completed in hours or days with wet paint applied to wet paint (opposed to wet on dry paint, completed in weeks and months). Rather than applying glazes and mixed colors, pure colors were often applied side by side, in thick, opaque, [[impasto]] strokes; blending in the eye of the viewer when observed from a distance. Black was used very sparingly, or not at all, and defining lines replaced with nuanced strokes of color forming the subjects, contours, and shapes. Art historian H. W. Janson said \"instead of adding to the illusion of real space, it strengthens the unity of the actual painted surface.\"<ref name=\"Janson (1977)\" /> Impressionist paintings typically depict landscapes, portraits, still lifes, domestic scenes, daily leisure and nightlife, all treated in a realist manner. Compositions were often based on unusual perspectives, appearing spontaneous and candid. The paintings were usually void of didactic, symbolic, or metaphoric meanings, and rarely addressed the biblical, mythological, and historical subjects that were so highly regarded by the academies or the darker and psychological interest explored by the symbolist. The nuances of light, shadow, atmosphere, and reflections of colors from surfaces were examined, sometimes emphasizing changes of these elements in time. The painting itself was the subject of the painting. It was art for art's sake, an idea that had been floating around for a few of decades but it perhaps reached a new high and consistency in impressionism.<ref name=\"Ponente (1965)\" /><ref name=\"Blunden & Blunden (1976)\" /><ref name=\"Courthion (1979)\" /><ref name=\"Leymarie (1955)\" />\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nFile:Edgar Degas, 1867c - Ballerinas in Pink.jpg|''Dancers in Pink''; [[Edgar Degas]]; 1867; oil on canvas, 59 \u00d7 74 cm.; Hill\u2013Stead Museum, Farmington, Connecticut (USA)\nFile:Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bazille 002.jpg|''View of the Village''; by [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bazille]]; 1868; oil on canvas, 130 \u00d7 89 cm.; Mus\u00e9e Fabre, Montpellier, (France)\nFile:Monet Painting on His Studio Boat Edouard Manet 1874.jpg|''Claude Monet in Argenteuil''; by [[\u00c9douard Manet]]; 1874; oil on canvas, 80 \u00d7 98 cm.; Neue Pinakothek, Munich (Germany) \nFile:Claude Monet 010.jpg|''The Railway Bridge at Argenteuil''; by [[Claude Monet]]; 1874; oil on canvas (60 \u00d7 80 cm); Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, Paris (France)\nFile:Guillaumin LaPlaceValhubert.jpg|''La Place Valhubert'' ;by [[Armand Guillaumin]]; 1875; oil on canvas.\nFile:Gustave Caillebotte - Mademoiselle Boissi\u00e8re Knitting - Google Art Project.jpg|''Mademoiselle Boissi\u00e8re Knitting''; by [[Gustave Caillebotte]]; 1877; oil on canvas, 65 \u00d7 80 cm.; Museum of Fine Arts, Houston (USA)\nFile:Nature morte, bol de pommes, par Paul C\u00e9zanne.jpg|''Bowl with Apples''; by [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]]; 1878\u201379; oil on canvas, 45.5 \u00d7 55 cm.; Annenberg Collection, Palm Springs (USA)\nFile:Berthe Morisot - Sommertag - 1879.jpeg|''Summer-day: Lake in the Bois de Boulogne''; by [[Berthe Morisot]]; 1879; oil on canvas, 45.7 \u00d7 75.2 cm.; National Gallery, London (England)\nFile:Alfred Sisley, Banks of the Seine at By.jpg|Banks of the Seine at By; by Alfred Sisley; ca. 1880\u201381; oil on canvas, 54.3 \u00d7 73.3 cm.; Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute, Williamstown, Massachusetts (USA)\nFile:Mary Cassatt, Automne, portrait de Lydia Cassatt, 1880, ppp706, Petit Palais.jpg|''Autumn, Lydia Cassatt''; [[Mary Cassatt]]; 1880; oil on canvas, 92.5 \u00d7 65.5 cm.; Petit Palais, Paris (France)\nFile:Pierre-Auguste Renoir 023.jpg|''The Loge''; by [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]]; 1881; oil on canvas, 127 \u00d7 92 cm.; Courtauld Institute of Art, London (England)\nFile:Edouard Manet, A Bar at the Folies-Berg\u00e8re.jpg|''A Bar at the Folies-Berg\u00e8re''; by [[\u00c9douard Manet]]; 1881\u201382; oil on canvas, 96 \u00d7 130 cm.; Courtauld Institute of Art, London (England)\nFile:Bordighera.jpg|''Bordighera''; by [[Claude Monet]]; 1884; oil on canvas, 81 \u00d7 65 cm.; Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago (USA)\nFile:Camille Pissarro 003.jpg|''Place du Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Fran\u00e7ais, Paris'': Rain; by [[Camille Pissarro]]; 1898; oil on canvas, 73.6 \u00d7 91.4 cm.; Minneapolis Institute of Art (USA)\nFile:Claude Monet - The Water Lilies - Morning - Google Art Project.jpg|''Water Lilies, Morning''; by [[Claude Monet]]; ca. 1814\u201324; oil on canvas, 2,000 \u00d7 12,750 mm; Mus\u00e9e de l'Orangerie, Paris (France)\n</gallery>\n\n==== Symbolism (c. 1860\u20131915) ====\n{{main|Symbolism (art)}}\n[[File:Head of Orpheus.jpg|thumb|150px|left|''Thracian Girl with Head of Orpheus on his Lyre''; by [[Gustave Moreau]]; 1865; oil; 154 x 99.5 cm; [[Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay]] (Paris)]]\nSymbolism emerged in France and Belgium in the 3rd quarter of the nineteenth century and spread throughout Europe in the 1870s, and later to America to a lesser extent. It evolved from romanticism without a clear or defining demarcation point, although poetry, literature, and specifically the publication of [[Charles Baudelaire|Charles Baudelaire's]] ''[[Les Fleurs du mal]]'' (''The Flowers of Evil'') in 1857 were significant in the development of symbolism. It had international expression in poetry, literature, drama, and music. In architecture, the applied arts, and decorative arts symbolism closely paralleled and overlapped into [[Art Nouveau]]. Symbolism is often inextricably linked to other contemporary art movements, surfacing and finding expression within other styles like [[Post-Impressionism]], [[Les Nabis]], the [[Decadent Movement]], the [[Fin de si\u00e8cle|Fin-de Siecle]], [[Art Nouveau]], The [[Munich Secession]], The [[Vienna Secession]], [[Expressionism]], and even the [[Pre-Raphaelites]], which had formed before and influenced symbolism as well. Artist as diverse as [[James McNeill Whistler]], [[Eug\u00e8ne Carri\u00e8re]], [[Ferdinand Hodler]], [[Fernand Khnopff]], [[Giovanni Segantini]], [[Lucien L\u00e9vy-Dhurmer]], [[Jean Delville]], and [[James Ensor]] all had varying degrees of association with symbolism. Art historian Robert L. Delevoy wrote \"Symbolism was less a school than the atmosphere of a period.\"<ref name=\"Delevoy (1978)\">Delevoy, Robert L. (1978) Symbolists and Symbolism.

The subjects are often presented as [[metaphors]] or [[allegories]], aiming to evoke highly subjective, personal, introspective emotions and ideas in the viewer, without clearly defining or addressing the subject directly.

It began in the late-19th century [[United Kingdom|Britain]], when writers such as [[John Ruskin]] and [[William Morris]] rejected mass-production and the often poor quality, machine-made items that were found in many homes and shops. [[William Morris|Morris]], in particular, believed in the importance of the individual craftsman, and advocated a return to hand craftsman, which, he argued, would not only produce better furniture, pottery, textiles, and other items, but would also help people to lead better, more fulfilling lives. Mass-production, he maintained, was responsible for a decline in values. Many Arts and Crafts designers drew upon the influence of medieval craftsmanship, and their objects and interiors exploited the distinctive qualities of natural materials, from beautifully finished [[oak]] to hand-woven tapestries. Others, however, looked further afield for inspiration, incorporating vivid colours inspired by [[Islamic art]], or [[Art of ancient Egypt|ancient Egyptian]] motifs in their work. Knots, swirls, [[Celtic cross]]es, and entrelac (interlanced designs) inspired by ancient [[Celtic art]] featured in the work of many Arts and Craftsdesigners, notably [[Archibald Knox (designer)|Archibald Knox]], especially on metalwork.\n\n==== Art Nouveau (c. 1870\u20131915)====\n{{main|Art Nouveau}} \n[[File:The Peacock Room.jpg|275px|thumb|''The Peacock Room''; by [[James McNeil Whistler]]; 1876\u20131877; Freer Gallery of Art, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, USA]]The earliest influences of Art Nouveau began to emerge in England among figures such as [[John Ruskin]], the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]], [[Edward Burne-Jones]], [[William Morris]] and the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]], which paralleled some aspects of symbolist sensibilities in France and Belgium at that time. Art Nouveau is closely allied and intermingled with symbolism. The term Art Nouveau is most often applied to architecture, crafts, and decorative arts, while symbolism is more commonly used for fine arts like painting and sculpture as well as poetry and literature, however there are no hard, defining lines between the two. Art Nouveau was an international movement that spread throughout Europe and North America reaching its peak around 1890\u20131905. It perhaps found its greatest expressions in architecture, influenced by theorist and historian [[Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc]], and seen in the work of [[Victor Horta]], [[Hector Guimard]], [[Louis Sullivan]], and [[Antoni Gaud\u00ed]]. However extraordinary examples of the style appeared in interior design, furniture, wallpaper, textiles, mosaics, ceramics, metalworking, jewelry, art glass, stain glass windows, and other decorative and applied arts produced by [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]],  [[Peter Carl Faberg\u00e9]], [[\u00c9mile Gall\u00e9]], [[Ren\u00e9 Lalique]], [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]], and many others. Japanese art, particularly the [[Woodblock printing in Japan|woodcut prints]], with design concepts that were new to Europeans began to appear and found receptive audiences there, where graphic artist such as [[Aubrey Beardsley]], [[Jules Ch\u00e9ret]], [[Walter Crane]], [[Eug\u00e8ne Grasset]], [[Alphonse Mucha]], and [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]] designed innovative posters, advertising, fashions, book binding, frontispieces, and illustrations.<ref name=\"Bouillon,  1985\">Bouillon, Jean-Paul. 1985.

Many artisans sought to breakdown the divide between fine art, applied art, and decorative art and merge them all into every aspect of daily life. Individual artist frequently moved back and forth between various disciplines and worked in several media. It was not unusual for architects to produce the furniture and other furnishings for the houses and building they designed, for painters to design advertising posters and book illustrations, or jewelers to produce art glass, and stain glass windows.<ref name=\"Bouillon,  1985\" /><ref name=\"FahrBecker, 1997\" />\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nFile:Aubrey Beardsley - The Climax.jpg|thumb|''Climax'', illustration for Oscar Wilde's Salome; by [[Aubrey Vincent Beardsley]]; 1893; etching\n\nHenri de Toulouse-Lautrec - Divan Japonais - Google Art Project.jpg|''[[Divan Japonais (lithograph)|Divan Japonais]]''; by [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]]; circa 1893\u20131894; litograph; 81 x 62.3 cm; [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts]] ([[Boston]], USA)\n\nFile:Statuette Lo\u00efe Fuller par Pierre Roche.jpg|thumb|''[[Loie Fuller]] Dancing''; by [[Pierre Roche]]; 1894 (Bronze, 1901); Mus\u00e9e des Arts D\u00e9coratifs (Paris)\n\nFile:Castel B\u00e9ranger, February 16, 2013.jpg|''Castel B\u00e9ranger'', Gate (apartment building); by [[Hector Guimard]]; 1895\u20131898; Paris\n\nFile:H\u00f4tel Solvay; by Victor Horta; 1895-1898; Brussels.jpg|''H\u00f4tel Solvay''; by [[Victor Horta]], architect; 1895\u20131898; [[Brussels]] ([[Belgium]])\n\nFile:Vase, by \u00c9mile Gall\u00e9, 1896; glass, height, 17.5 cm, Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York City).jpg|thumb|Vase, by \u00c9mile Gall\u00e9, 1896; glass, height, 17.5 cm, Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York City)\n\nFile:Alfons Mucha - 1896 - Biscuits Lef\u00e8vre-Utile.jpg|''Biscuits Lef\u00e8vre-Utile'', advertisement; by [[Alfons Mucha]]; 1896; lithograph; 62 \u00d7 43.5 cm; private collection\n\nRen\u00e9 lailique, pettorale libellula, in oro, smalti, crisoprazio, calcedonio, pietre lunari e diamanti, 1897-98 ca. 01.jpg|The ''Dragonfly brooch''; by [[Ren\u00e9 Lalique]]; circa 1897\u20131898; gold, [[vitreous enamel]], [[chrysoprase]], [[chalcedony]], [[moonstone (gemstone)|moonstone]] and diamond; height: 23 cm, width: 26.5 cm; [[Calouste Gulbenkian Museum]] ([[Lisboa]], Portugal) \n\nTsunami by hokusai 19th century.jpg|''[[The Great Wave off Kanagawa]]''; by [[Katsushika Hokusai]]; circa 1830\u20131832; full-colour woodblock print; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nSculptural bowl MET DP325860.jpg|Sculptural bowl; 1900; stoneware; 27.6 \u00d7 55.2 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nLe Jeu de l'echarpe (Dancer with scarf), by Agathon Leonard, before 1901, Susse Freres, Paris, gilt bronze - Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt - Darmstadt, Germany - DSC00944.jpg|''Le Jeu de l'echarpe'' (Dancer with scarf); by Agathon Leonard; before 1901; gilt bronze; [[Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt]] ([[Darmstadt]], Germany)\n\nRen\u00e9 lalique, pettine in corno, oro, smalti e brillanti, 1902 ca-V2.jpg|Hair ornament; by [[Ren\u00e9 Lalique]]; circa 1902; gold, emeralds and diamonds; [[Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay]] (Paris)\n\nFile:\u03a3\u03b1\u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03b4\u03b1 \u03a6\u03b1\u03bc\u03af\u03bb\u03b9\u03b1 2941.jpg|''Bas\u00edlica de la Sagrada Fam\u00edlia''; by [[Antoni Gaud\u00ed]]; began in 1882 and still under construction; [[Barcelona]] (Spain) [cranes digitally removed]\n\nFile:Casa Batllo Overview Barcelona Spain cut.jpg|The ''[[Casa Batll\u00f3]]''; by Antoni Gaud\u00ed; Barcelona\n\nArt Nouveau Dining Masson.jpg|Cabinet; [[Eugene Vallin]] in collaboration with [[Victor Prouv\u00e9]]; circa 1903\u20131906; probably made of mahogany; [[Mus\u00e9e de l'\u00c9cole de Nancy]] ([[Nancy, France|Nancy]], France)\n</gallery>\n\n=== Post-Impressionism (c. 1885 - 1905) ===\n{{main|Post-Impressionism}}\n[[File:Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, At the Moulin Rouge.jpg|thumb|''At the Moulin Rouge''; by [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]]; 1892; oil on canvas, 123 \u00d7 140.5 cm.; Art Institute of Chicago (USA)]] Post-Impressionism is a rather imprecise term applied to a diverse generation of artist. In its strictest sense, it pertains to four highly influential artist: [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]],<ref>Raynal, M. (1954) ''Cezanne'': Biographical and Critical Study: The Taste of Our Time, Vol. 8.

Abrams, Inc., Publishers, New York, 131 pp. </ref> Each passed through an impressionist phase, but ultimately emerged with four very original but different styles. Collectively, their work anticipated, and often directly influenced, much of the [[avant-garde]] art that appear before the First World War including fauvism, cubism, expressionism, and early abstraction. C\u00e9zanne (particularly influential on cubism) and Van Gogh worked in relative isolation, away from Paris, at critical points in their careers, while Seurat and Gauguin worked in groups, more collaboratively, at key points in their development. Another important artist of the period is [[Toulouse-Lautrec]], an influential painter as well as graphic artist.<ref>Lassaigne, J. (1953) Lautrec: Biographical and Critical Studies, The Taste of Our Time, Vol. 3. Editions D'Art Albert Skira, Geneva, 121 pp.</ref><ref>Cooper, D. (1966) Toulouse-Lautrec: The Library of Great Painters. Harry N. Abrams, Inc., Publishers, New York, 152 pp.</ref> In a broader sense, post-impressionism includes a generation of predominantly French and Belgian artist who worked in a range of styles and groups. Most had come under the sway of impressionism at some point, but pushed their work beyond it into a number of factions as early as the mid 1880s, sometimes as a logical development of impressionism, other times as a reaction against it. Post-Impressionist typically depicted impressionist subjects, but the work, particularly synthetism, often contained symbolism, spiritualism, and moody atmospheres that rarely appeared in impressionism. Unnatural colors, patterns, flat plains, odd perspectives and viewpoints pushed to extremes, all moved the center of modernism a step closer to abstraction with a standard for experimentation.<ref name=\"Arnason (1977)\" /><ref name=\"Raynal (1953)\">Raynal, Maurice (1953) ''Modern Painting'': Painting, Color, History. Editions D'Art Albert Skira, Geneva, 339 pp. [Translated to English by Stuart Gilbert]</ref><ref name=\"Daval (1979)\" />\n\n'''[[Neo-Impressionism]]''' ([[Divisionism]] or [[Pointillism]], c. 1884-1894) explored light and color based on scientific color theories, creating mosaics of brush strokes in pure colors, sometimes laid out in rhythmic patterns with lines influenced by art nouuveau. The leading artist were [[Georges Seurat]] and [[Paul Signac]], others include [[Henri-Edmond Cross]], [[Maximilien Luce]], [[Albert Dubois-Pillet]], and for a period [[Pissarro]] and [[Van Gogh]]. It was influential on fauvism, and elements of the style appeared in expressionism, cubism, and early abstraction. '''[[Synthetism]]''' ([[Cloisonnism]] c. 1888-1903) Cloisonnism was conceived by [[\u00c9mile Bernard]] and immediately taken up and developed by [[Paul Gauguin]] and others while at an artists' colony in Pont-Aven, Brittany, France. The style resembled [[cloisonn\u00e9 enamel]] or [[Stained glass|stained glass]], with flat, bold colors outlined in black or dark colors. Synthetism, exemplified in the work of Gauguin and [[Paul S\u00e9rusier]], is slightly a broader term with less emphasis on dark outlines and cloisonn\u00e9 qualities. Other artist include [[Cuno Amiet]], [[Louis Anquetin]], [[Charles Filiger]], [[Meyer de Haan |Jacob Meyer de Haan]], [[Charles Laval]], and [[Armand S\u00e9guin (painter)|Armand Seguin]]. Their work greatly influenced fauvism and expressionism. '''[[Les Nabis]]''' [c. 1890-1905: Hebrew for prophets or illuminati] was a larger movement in France and Belgium that eclectically drew on progressive elements in synthetism, neo-impressionism, symbolism, and art nouuveau. Perhaps more influential than the art, were the numerous theories, manifestoes, and infectious enthusiasm for the avant-garde, setting the tone for the proliferation of movements and \"isms\" in the first quarter of the 20th century. [[La Revue Blanche]] often published Las Nabis and symbolist content. The work of [[\u00c9douard Vuillard]]<ref>Preston, S. (1974) ''Vuillard'': The Library of Great Painters. Harry N.

Its genesis was in 1895 when [[Henri Matisse]], the oldest and central figure, entered the studio of [[Gustave Moreau]] at the [[Ecole des Beaux Arts (Paris)|Ecole des Beaux-Arts]]. There he met [[Georges Rouault]], [[Charles Camoin]], [[Henri Manguin]], and [[Albert Marquet]]. Marquet said \"As early as 1898 Matisse and I were working in what was later to be called the Fauve manner. The first exhibitions at the Indep\u00e9ndants in which we were, I believe, the only ones to paint in pure tones, go back to 1901.\"<ref name=\"Leymarie (1959)\">Leymarie, J.

During this period a number of influential retrospective exhibitions were held in Paris: Seurat (1900, 1905), Van Gogh (1901, 1905), Toulouse-Lautrec (1902), Gauguin (1906), Cezanne (1907), all relatively unknown to the public at that time. Matisse and Derain collected African carvings, a novel but growing curiosity of the time. Matisse spent the summer of 1904 in [[Saint-Tropez]] painting with the neo-impressionist [[Paul Signac]] and [[Henri-Edmond Cross]], followed in1905 by Camoin, Manguin, and Marquet. The artist exhibited regularity at the [[Salon Des Independants|Salon des Indep\u00e9ndants]] and the [[Salon d'Automne]] 1903-1908 and in 1905 their work created a sensation and a scandal. Matisse stated \"We were exhibiting at the Salon d'Automne, Derain, Manguin, Marquet, Puy, and a few others were hung together in one of the larger galleries. In the center of this room the sculptor [[Albert Marque|Marque]] exhibited a bust of a child very much in the Italian style. [[Louis Vauxcelles|Vauxcelles]] [art critic for [[Gil Blas (periodical)|Gil Blas]]] entered the room and said, Well! well! [[Donatello]] in the mist of wild beasts!

Unlike the impressionist and their long struggle for acceptance, the avant-garde had an eager audience by 1906-1907 and the fauvist were attracting collectors from America to Russia. However fauvism largely dissolved in 1908, as cubism appeared, most of the artist began exploring other styles and moving in different directions.

They applied paint with loose brushstrokes, in thick, unnatural, often contrasting, vibrant colors, at times straight from the tube. Gauguin's influence, with his exploration of the expressive values and spatial aspects of patterning with flat, pure colors, as well as his interest in [[primitivism]] were significant, as was neo-impressionism. Matisse explained - for a long time color served as a complement of design, the painters of the Renaissance constructed the picture by line, adding local color afterwards - writing: \"From [[Delacroix]] to Van Gogh and chiefly to Gauguin, by way of the Impressionist, who cleared the ground, and C\u00e9zanne, who gave the final impulse and introduced colored volumes, we can follow this rehabilitation of color's function, this restoration of its emotive power\"<ref name=\"Leymarie (1959)\" /> Fauvism was the culmination in changing the fundamental role of color in painting and they depicted their subjects on the verge of abstraction.<ref name=\"Leymarie (1959)\" /><ref name=\"Clay (1978)\" /> <ref name=\"Diehl (1972)\" /> <ref name=\"Lassaigne (1959)\" /> <ref name=\"Jacobus (1973)\" />\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nFile:Bonheur Matisse.jpg|thumb|''[[Le bonheur de vivre]]'', by [[Henri Matisse]]; 1905\u20131906; oil on canvas; 175 x 241&nbsp;cm; [[Barnes Foundation]]\nFile:Houses at Chatou.jpg|thumb|''Houses at Chatou''; by [[Maurice de Vlaminck]]; ca. 1905; oil on canvas, 81 \u00d7 101 cm; Art Institute of Chicago (USA)\nFile:Fauvism Landscape; by Louis Valtat; oil on canvas, Speed Art Museum, Louisville, Kentucky II.jpg|thumb|''Fauve Landscape''; by [[Louis Valtat]]; 1905\u20131906; oil on canvas; Speed Art Museum, Louisville, Kentucky\nFile:Derain CharingCrossBridge.png|thumb|''Charing Cross Bridge, London''; by [[Andr\u00e9 Derain]]; 1906; oil on canvas, 80.3 x 100.3 cm.; National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC. \nFile:LA CIOTAT.PNG|thumb|''La Ciotat''; by [[Othon Friesz]]; 1907; oil on canvas, 65.7 by 81 cm.; collection unknown \n</gallery>\n\n===Early 20th century===\n{{See also|20th-century Western painting}}\nThe history of [[20th-century art]] is a narrative of endless possibilities and the search for new standards, each being torn down in succession by the next. The art movements of [[Fauvism]], [[Expressionism]], [[Cubism]], [[abstract art]], [[Dada]]ism and [[Surrealism]] led to further explorations of new creative styles and manners of expression. Increasing [[globalization|global]] interaction during this time saw an equivalent influence of other cultures into Western art, such as [[Pablo Picasso]] being influenced by [[Iberian sculpture]], [[African art|African sculpture]] and [[Primitivism]]. [[Japonism]], and Japanese [[woodcut]]s (which had themselves been influenced by Western Renaissance draftsmanship) had an immense influence on Impressionism and subsequent artistic developments. The influential example set by [[Paul Gauguin]]'s interest in [[Oceanic art]] and the sudden popularity among the [[Connoisseur|cognoscenti]] in early 20th century Paris of newly discovered African fetish sculptures and other works from non-European cultures were taken up by Picasso, [[Henri Matisse]], and many of their colleagues. Later in the 20th century, [[Pop Art]] and [[Abstract Expressionism]] came to prominence.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nFile:Gustav Klimt 046.jpg|thumb|''[[Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I]]'', an [[Art Nouveau]] masterpiece; by [[Gustav Klimt]]; 1907; oil, silver, and gold on canvas; 140 x 140 cm; [[Neue Galerie New York]]\nConstantin Brancusi, 1907-08, The Kiss, Exhibited at the Armory Show and published in the Chicago Tribune, 25 March 1913..jpg|''[[The Kiss (Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i sculpture)|The Kiss]]''; by [[Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i]]; 1907; stone; height: 28&nbsp;cm; [[Craiova Art Museum]] (Romania)\nHenri Rousseau - Le R\u00eave - Google Art Project.jpg|''[[The Dream (Rousseau painting)|The Dream]]''; by [[Henri Rousseau]]; 1910; oil on canvas; 204.5 x 298.5&nbsp;cm; Museum of Modern Art (New York City)\nAtget Int\u00e9rieur d'un ouvrier rue de Romainville.jpg|Photo of the interior of the apartment of [[Eug\u00e8ne Atget]], taken in 1910\nWoman's Head MET DT203051.jpg|Female head; by [[Amedeo Modigliani]]; 1912; [[limestone]]; height: 68.3&nbsp;cm, width: 15.9&nbsp;cm, depth: 24.1&nbsp;cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\nImage-Chagall Fiddler.jpg|''The Violinist''; by [[Marc Chagall]]; 1912\u20131913; oil on checked tablecloth; 1.88 x 1.58 m; [[Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam]] (The Netherlands)\nKirchner 1913 Street, Berlin.jpg|''[[Street, Berlin (Kirchner)|Street, Berlin]]''; by [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]]; 1913; oil on canvas; 1.21 x 0.91 m; Museum of Modern Art (New York City)\nVassily Kandinsky, 1923 - On White II.jpg|''On White II''; by [[Wassily Kandinsky]]; 1923; oil on canvas; 105 \u00d7 98&nbsp;cm; [[Mus\u00e9e national d'Art moderne]] (Paris)\n</gallery>\n\n[[Cubism]] consisted in the rejection of perspective, which leads to a new organisation of space where viewpoints multiply producing a fragmentation of the object that renders the predilection for form over the content of the representation obvious.

La R\u00e9volution Surr\u00e9aliste, No. 12, December 15 [Reissued in 1930 by Simon Kra, Paris.]</ref> Surrealism did not have significant expression in applied or decorative arts, architecture, or music, although a few isolated examples could be identified (e.g. chess sets, furniture, [[Las Pozas of Xilitla Mexico|Las Pozas]]). The small and short lived [[Metaphysical art|Metaphysical School]] (ca. 1910-1921), with [[Giorgio de Chirico]] as its principal figure, was highly influential on surrealism. The surrealist explored a myriad of innovative techniques, some had recently been developed in Cubism and Dada, others were new, including [[collage]], found objects, assemblage, random chance, rayographs (photograms), painting on sand, dripping and flinging paint, [[decalcomania]], [[Frottage (art)|frottage]], [[Fumage|fumage]], and raclage. Two fundamental approaches predominate surrealist art. [[Surrealist automatism|Automatism]] dominated in the early years which can be seen in the work of artist like [[Andr\u00e9 Masson]] and [[Joan Mir\u00f3|Joan Mir\u00f3]]. Other artist, swayed by work of Giorgio de Chirico, used more traditional methods and mediums to illustrate unfiltered thoughts and incongruous juxtapositions, including [[Salvador Dali]] and [[Ren\u00e9 Magritte]]. Significant artist include [[Jean Arp]], [[Hans Bellmer]], [[Victor Brauner]], [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]], [[Joseph Cornell]], [[\u00d3scar Dom\u00ednguez]], [[Max Ernst]], [[Wifredo Lam]], [[Yves Tanguy]], [[Man Ray]], [[Alberto Giacometti]], [[M\u00e9ret Oppenheim]], and [[Roberto Matta]]. Other important artist informally accosted with surrealism include [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Pablo Picasso]], and [[Frida Kahlo]]. Surrealist ideas and theories were discussed in a successive series of journals, ''[[La R\u00e9volution Surr\u00e9aliste]]'' (1924-1929), ''[[Le Surrealisme au service de la revolution]]'' (1930-1933), ''[[Minotaure]]'' (1933-1939), ''[[VVV (magazine)|VVV]]'' (1942-1944). The automatic paintings produced by Andr\u00e9 Masson and Juna Mir\u00f3, as well as latecomers to surrealism like Roberto Matta and [[Arshile Gorky]] had a considerable influenced on the [[abstract expressionist]] in the late 1940s. <ref name=\"Waldberg (1962)\">Waldberg, Patrick (1962) ''Surrealism'', The Taste of Our Time, Vol. 37, Editions D'Art Albert Skira, Geneva, 151 pp.</ref><ref name=\"Rubin (1968)\">Rubin, William S.

Though born in [[Hungary]], he adapted the [[Jews of Germany|German-Jewish]] approach of openness towards general culture, world and society. \n\nHe employed the critical scientific method to the [[Talmud]] and wrote about the history of the development of the form of the [[Oral law#Oral law in Judaism|Oral law]] (as opposed to the development of the [[halachah|Law]] itself, the latter being an enterprise antithetical to traditional Jewish beliefs; see below). Despite his worldly inclinations, he was an original member of the more traditionally oriented ''[[Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah]]'' (council of great Torah sages), and was also known to be a person of great moral conduct and piety.\n\nHoffman was the leading authority on traditional ''[[halakha]]'' (Jewish law) in [[Germany]] in his lifetime, as well as an expert in the area of ''[[midrash halakha]]'' (legalistic [[Biblical exegesis]]). He was also known for his efforts to disprove the [[Documentary Hypothesis]], as expressed by the [[Julius Wellhausen|Graf-Wellhausen]] theory, with his arguments presented in the work ''Die wichtigsten Instanzen gegen die Graf-Wellhausensche Hypothese'' (1903/1916).  [[A. Altmann]], however, sees Hoffmann's writings on these matters (though evidencing great expertise) as pure apologetics, the cause of which may be seen as laid out in his introduction to [[Leviticus]] {{Harv|Ellenson|Jacobs|1988}}, where Hoffmann makes the following remarks:\n\n{{quotation|I willingly agree that, in consequence of the foundation of my belief, I am unable to arrive at the conclusion that the [[Pentateuch]] was written by anyone other than [[Moses]]... \nWe believe that the whole [[Jewish Bible|Bible]] is true, holy, and of divine origin. That every word of the [[Torah]] was inscribed by divine command is expressed in the principle ''Torah min Ha Shamayim''... We must not presume to set ourselves up as critics of the author of a biblical text or doubt the truth of his statements or question the correctness of his teaching...\nThe Jewish commentator must (therefore) constantly be on guard against interpreting the passage in such a way as to appear to be in conflict with traditional [[Halachah]]. Just as the Torah as a divine revelation must not contradict itself, in the same way it must not contradict the Oral Law which is of divine origin.}}\n  \nYet, despite the piety of the above sentiments, and his repeated proclamations regarding the divinity of the Oral Law, Hoffmann was still very much the ''[[Wissenschaft des Judentums|Wissenschaft]]'' scholar. He cites in his work scholars such as [[Z. Frankel]], [[A. Geiger]], [[S.J. Rapoport]], and [[H. Graetz]], he studies the influences of [[Ancient Near Eastern]] culture on the evolution of the Talmud, and he identifies problems in the transmitted text. For example, Hoffmann in ''The First Mishna'' (discussed [[#Writings|below]]) sees the present Mishna [[Pirkei Avot|Avot]] as having been redacted from three different sources, a Mishna of [[Rabbi Akiva]], a Mishna of [[Rabbi Meir]], and a Mishna of [[Rabbi Judah Ha-Nasi]], the originals of which cannot be completely reconstructed due to their thoroughgoing fusion and subsequent manipulation.\n\nThe extent to which Hoffmann resided in the ''Wissenschaft'' movement can also be seen from the criticism he received from such opponents of the movement as Samson Raphael Hirsch. Hildesheimer notes regarding Hirsch's opinion of his Rabbinical Seminary (where Hoffmann worked<ref name=je/> after leaving Hirsch's institution) that \"a question certainly exists as to whether Rabbi Hirsch considers the seminary to be an Orthodox institution.\" Hirsch's opposition extended to Hoffmann's own work, judging Hoffmann's book ''Mar Samuel'' to contain heresies {{Harv|Ellenson|Jacobs|1988}}.\n\nHoffmann's resolution of this tension between faithfulness to tradition and textual criticism is found by {{Harvtxt|Ellenson|Jacobs|1988}} in the following passage from the introduction to ''The First Mishna'':\n\n{{quotation|Thus, in the study of the [[Tanakh|Holy Scriptures]] on the one hand, we consider the authenticity and integrity to be absolute, and we can recognize as true only such results as do not question that premise.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society.

South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so.
