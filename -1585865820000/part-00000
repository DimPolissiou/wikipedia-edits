{"title_page": "Indiana Repertory Theatre", "text_new": "[[File:Indiana Theatre, Indianapolis, in 2010.jpg|thumb|250px|The Indiana Repertory Theatre]]\n\n'''Indiana Repertory Theatre''', frequently abbreviated '''IRT''', is a professional regional theatre in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]] that began as a genuine [[repertory theatre]] with its casts performing in multiple shows at once.  It has subsequently become a [[Regional theatre in the United States|regional theatre]] and a member of the League of Resident Theatres.  A standard season typically consists of nine or ten plays on two different stages (with at least two selected especially although not exclusively for student audiences, one of which is often a Shakespeare play) and the bulk of its season (including a holiday show, usually [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'') performed on the ''OneAmerica Stage''.\n\nThe theatre company has history in two theatre buildings.   It began in 1972 in The Athenaeum.  In 1980, the IRT moved to its current home, The [[Indiana Theatre (Indianapolis, Indiana)|Indiana Theatre]], a former Paramount Pictures Publix Theatre at 140 West Washington Street, built in 1927 and converted from a movie theater for IRT's use.<ref name=IRTHistory>[http://www.irtlive.com/About/About_history.aspx IRT History]</ref>\n\n==Past Actors and Productions==\n\nAmong the better known actors that have performed multiple times at the theatre are Priscilla Lindsay, former Assistant Artistic Director, [[Scott Wentworth]], a founding member, and John Henry Redwood, who would later pass away when touring a one-man show he premiered in 2001 at Indiana Repertory.  This show, ''Looking Over the President's Shoulder'', was commissioned by [[James Still (playwright)]], the IRT's Playwright in Residence.  This play is the true story of [[Alonzo Fields]], who served as a butler to three presidents of the United States.  Another playwright who has written works on IRT commissions is [[Charles Smith (playwright)|Charles Smith]], including ''Les Trois Dumas'' and ''[[Sister Carrie]]'', and last season's ''Gospel According to James''.  Another actor, Johnny Lee Davenport played Deputy Marshal Henry in ''[[The Fugitive (1993 film)|The Fugitive]]''  and ''[[U.S. Marshals (film)|U.S. Marshals]]'', as well as playing the title character in [[Othello]].  Tim Grimm makes regular appearances in the theatre, often, but not always, as a rural sort of character.\n\nThe theatre is well known in the state for their production of [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' as adapted by Tom Haas, a late IRT artistic director/member of the former repertory company.  It is a [[chamber theatre]] production modeled on [[David Edgar (playwright)|David Edgar]]'s ''[[The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby (play)|The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby]]'', that retains many of the story's darkest elements, such as the scene featuring Want and Ignorance that Dickens himself considered its heart, but is often omitted.\n\nFor the most part, the theatre stopped doing musicals in the 1990s however the IRT did produce the world premiere musical ''Captive Heart: The Frances Slocum Story'' (1999), by Jeff Hooper (book) and Bob Lucas (music and lyrics).  This musical is based on the story of [[Frances Slocum|Maconaquah]], which is part of the standard history curriculum in Indiana, and an Indiana premiere of a musical with a book by Wentworth, ''[[Enter the Guardsman]]'', based on the [[Ferenc Moln\u00e1r]] play, ''[[The Guardsman]]'', with music by [[Craig Bohmler]] and lyrics by Marion Adler.  The IRT has done more recent productions of ''Crowns'' ([[Regina Taylor]]), ''[[The Fantasticks]]'' ([[Harvey Schmidt]] and [[Tom Jones (writer)|Tom Jones]]), and [[Stephen Sondheim]]'s ''[[A Little Night Music]]'' starring [[Sylvia McNair]].\n\nThe theatre sponsors an Indiana playwriting competition for middle and high school aged writers, Young Playwrights in Process, funded in part by a gift from the late Robert and Margot Eccles.\n\n==Past Seasons==\n\n===2016-2017===\n\n*The Three Musketeers (m) 09/20/16 Dumas/Bush Woronicz, Henry\n*Finding Home: Indiana at 200 * (u) 10/18/16 multiple writers & Grimm Amster, Peter\n*A Christmas Carol (m \u2013 holiday) 11/19/16 Dickens/Haas Allen, Janet\n*Guess Who\u2019s Coming to Dinner (m) 01/10/17 Rose/Kreidler Greer, Skip\n*The Cay (u \u2013 students & families) 01/28/17 Taylor/Cornelison Roberts, Richard\n*Stuart Little (cab \u2013 young children) 02/25/17 White/Robinette Walters, Lori\n*Boeing Boeing (m) 03/07/17 Camoletti/Cross & Evans Gordon, Laura\n*Miranda (u) 03/28/17 Still, James Godinez, Henry\n*Dial \u201cM\u201d for Murder (m) 04/25/17 Knott, Frederick Still, James\n\n===2015-2016===\n\n#The Great Gatsby (m) 10/01/15 Fitzgerald/Levy Amster, Peter\n#April 4, 1968: 10/21/15 Still, James Sale, Courtney\n#Before We Forgot How to Dream # (u)\n#A Christmas Carol (m \u2013 holiday) 11/11/15 Dickens/Haas Sale, Courtney\n#Peter Rabbit and Me (cab \u2013 young children) 11/17/15 Potter/Harris Bable, Wendy\n#The Mystery of Irma Vep (u) 01/12/16 Ludlum, Charles Still, James\n#To Kill a Mockingbird (m \u2013 students & families) 01/26/16 Lee/Sergel Allen, Janet\n#Fences (m) 03/09/16 Wilson, August Bellamy, Lou\n#Bridge & Tunnel (u) 03/29/16 Jones, Sarah Roberts, Richard\n#The Mousetrap (m) 04/26/16 Christie, Agatha Sale, Courtney\n\n===2014-2015===\n\n#The Two Gentlemen of Verona (m) 09/16/14 Shakespeare, William Ocel, Tim\n#Red (u) 10/14/14 Logan, John Still, James\n#A Christmas Carol (m \u2013 holiday) 11/13/14 Dickens/Haas Sale, Courtney\n#The Velveteen Rabbit (cab \u2013 young children) 11/18/14 Still, James/Williams North, Carol\n#Good People (m) 01/07/15 Lindsay-Abaire, David Allen, Janet\n#The Giver (u \u2013 students & families) 01/23/15 Lowry/Coble Sale, Courtney\n#The Hound of the Baskervilles (m) 02/18/15 Wright/Pichette Amster, Peter\n#What I Learned in Paris (u) 03/17/15 Cleage, Pearle Bellamy, Lou\n#On Golden Pond (m) 04/14/15 Thompson, Ernest Allen, Janet\n\n===2013-2014 Season===\n\n# ''The Crucible'' - [[Arthur Miller]]\n# ''An Iliad'' - by Lisa Peterson and Denis O'Hare adapted from [[Homer]] translated by Robert Fagles\n# ''A Christmas Carol'' - [[Charles Dickens]]\n# ''and then they came for me: Remembering the World of Anne Frank'' - James Still\n# ''Kurt Vonnegut's Who am I this Time?(& other conundrums of love)'' - Aaron Posner\n# ''Other Desert Cities'' - Jon Robin Baitz\n# ''The Mountaintop'' - Katori Hall\n# ''[[Ken Ludwig|Ken Ludwig's]] [[The Game's Afoot]]''\n\n===2012-2013 Season===\n\n# ''Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde''' - [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], adapted by Jeffrey Hatcher\n# ''The Night Watcher'' - [[Charlayne Woodard]]\n# ''The Syringa Tree'' - Pamela Gien\n# ''The House That Jack Built'' - [[James Still (playwright)|James Still]]\n# ''Jackie and Me'' - [[Dan Gutman]], adapted by [[Steven Dietz]]\n# ''A Little Night Music'' - music and lyrics by [[Stephen Sondheim]], book by [[Hugh Wheeler]]\n# ''The Whipping Man'' - Matthew Lopez\n# ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' - [[William Shakespeare]]\n\n===2011-2012 Season===\n\n# ''Dracula'' - [[Steven Dietz]]\n# ''I Love to Eat'' - [[James Still (playwright)|James Still]]\n# ''Lost: A Memoir'' - [[Cathy Ostlere]] and Dennis Garnhum\n# ''Nobody Don't Like Yogi'' - Tom Lysaght\n# ''Julius Caesar'' - [[William Shakespeare]]\n# ''A Christmas Carol'' - [[Charles Dickens]], adapted by [[Tom Haas]]\n# ''Radio Golf'' - [[August Wilson]]\n# ''God of Carnage'' - [[Yasmina Reza]]\n# ''Fallen Angels'' - [[No\u00ebl Coward]]\n# ''The Miracle Worker'' - [[William Gibson]]\n\n===2010-2011 Season===\n\n# ''Holes'' - [[Louis Sachar]]\n# ''Mary's Wedding'' - [[Stephen Massicotte]]\n# ''A Christmas Carol'' - [[Charles Dickens]], adapted by [[Tom Haas]]\n# ''The Diary of Anne Frank'' - [[Frances Goodrich]] and [[Albert Hackett]], newly adapted by [[Wendy Kesselman]]\n# ''Neat'' - [[Charlayne Woodard]]\n# ''Fire in the Garden'' - Ken Weitzman\n# ''In Acting Shakespeare'' - [[James DeVita]]\n# ''The Gospel According to James'' - [[Charles Smith (playwright)|Charles Smith]] - World Premiere\n# ''The 39 Steps'' - adapted by [[Patrick Barlow]], original concept by [[Simon Corble]] and Nobby Dimon, based on the novel by [[James Buchan]]\n\n===2009-2010 Season===\n\n# ''Love Letters'' - [[A.R.

Angelica Turing \"gave birth\" to this cluster shortly before her suicide. Jonas Maliki acts as their mentor. Throughout the first season, the sensates' new powers confuse them, as they frequently visit each other with no control via their newfound psychic link. Over the course of the season, they each get to know each other, eventually gaining more control over their abilities. By the end of season one, they may all visit each other and share their abilities at will, with everyone aiding Will when Riley is captured by the series' main villain, Whispers. During \"A Christmas Special\", they are all shown to be close friends now, frequently visiting the others, even when it's just to talk.\n\n===Capheus \"Van Damme\" Onyango===\nPortrayed by [[Aml Ameen]] in the first season and [[Toby Onwumere]] in the second.<ref name=buzzfeed2/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.voice-online.co.uk/article/aml-ameen-london-boys-amazing-journey |title=Aml Ameen: The London boy's amazing journey |author=Natricia Duncan |date=October 18, 2014 |work=[[The Voice (British newspaper)|The Voice]] |publisher=GV Media Group |accessdate=October 20, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507131933/http://www.voice-online.co.uk/article/aml-ameen-london-boys-amazing-journey |archivedate=May 7, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite interview |url=http://www.jetmag.com/entertainment/aml-ameen/ |title=Aml Ameen on 'The Maze Runner' & More |subject=Aml Ameen |subjectlink=Aml Ameen |interviewer=L'Oreal Thompson |date=September 19, 2014 |work=[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]] |publisher=[[Johnson Publishing Company|Ebony Media Operations]] |accessdate=October 19, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507132438/http://www.jetmag.com/entertainment/aml-ameen/ |archivedate=May 7, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"recast\">{{cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2016/04/sense8-aml-ameen-toby-onwumere-recasting-wachowski-netflix-series-1201744886/ |title='Sense8': Aml Ameen Replaced By Toby Onwumere In Wachowskis' Netflix Series |date=April 26, 2016 |publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]] |author1=Nellie Andreeva |author2=Mike Fleming Jr |work=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |accessdate=April 27, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507132635/http://deadline.com/2016/04/sense8-aml-ameen-toby-onwumere-recasting-wachowski-netflix-series-1201744886/ |archivedate=May 7, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite tweet |number=755437703467036672 |user=toby_onwumere |title=Game time. |date=July 19, 2016 |author=Toby Onwumere |accessdate=August 8, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808180202/https://twitter.com/toby_onwumere/status/755437703467036672 |archivedate=August 8, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref> Gabriel Ouma portrayed a young Capheus.\n\nMain skills and traits: endlessly optimistic outlook, inspiring positivity, unwavering moral advice, and expert driving skills.\n\nA [[matatu]] driver in [[Nairobi]], and a passionate fan of [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]] who is trying to earn money to buy [[AIDS]] medicine for his mother. Capheus owns his bus matatu business with his best friend Jela. Their business is failing, however, in competition with another matatu. One day, they drive through a shady part of a nearby city, where they are ambushed by a local warlord's men, who take their money and the medicine Capheus has bought for his mother. Capheus goes after them, and is about to be killed when he channels Sun, a sensate in his cluster with intensive kickboxing training, and who Capheus at first believes is the spirit of Van Damme. With her skills, they defeat the men, and his fighting skills gain his matatu business popularity, and draws the attention of Silas Kabaka, one of Nairobi's most powerful crime lords. He hires Capheus to drive his daughter Amondi every day to a CDC center for cancer treatment, as he cannot send his men to do it without drawing attention to her. When Silas is captured by his enemies, Capheus decides to save him, once again channeling Sun to defeat the men, saving Silas and reuniting him with his daughter. Capheus' driving skills often come in handy for the other sensates, and he is able to use this to help Nomi escape Whispers' men by taking over the drive through the streets of San Francisco.\n\nHis matatu is irreparable after his heist to save Silas, but Silas repays him by buying him a new one. Because of his reputation for taking down the superpower, his business is booming, and people begin seeing him as something of an idol. He is later approached to run for office, and run against the current politically corrupt president. His messages of hope and power ring true to the people in Nairobi however he is still targeted at one major rally and by people that think he is reckless. Silas even endorses him but it later turns out he is in love with Capheus' mother. After one rally goes terribly with riots breaking out as well as his staff turning against him, he is saved by the Superpower gang. He is also determined to quit, but his message and speeches go viral.\n\n===Sun Bak===\nPortrayed by [[Bae Doona|Doona Bae]].<ref name=buzzfeed2/> Jaein Lee (credited as Jane Lee in season 1) portrayed a young Sun.\n\nThe daughter of a powerful [[Seoul]] businessman and a burgeoning star in the underground [[kickboxing]] world, with a master's degree in economics. When Sun's brother Joong-Ki is caught embezzling, Sun's father asks her to take the blame before the police and court find out, as Sun is already looked down upon by their partners for being a woman. Remembering her deceased mother's words to always look out for her brother, Sun agrees, and goes to jail for a crime she didn't commit. She becomes unpopular when she looks out for a woman who is often bullied by the other inmates. Sun helps her get revenge on the women picking on her, leading them to ambush Sun in the courtyard. Sun easily fends them off, but is locked in solitary confinement for fighting. Soon afterwards, her father comes to visit her, telling her that she has been a better child than her brother ever was, and that he will come forward about who really committed the crimes, as he wishes to free Sun. The next day however, Sun's brother visits and tells her that their father killed himself the night before. Sun is quickly able to realize that Joong-Ki killed their father after realizing he would come forward and that he would end up in jail. Sun is arguably the most useful of the sensates and is considered 'the muscle.' She often comes to rescue others in the cluster with her kickboxing skills whenever they are cornered, and especially when Will goes to free Riley from Whispers. She has the strongest bond with Capheus, and interacts with him the most.\n\nDuring the next few months, Sun frequently visits the other sensates to escape from solitary confinement, while the women she defended bribe the guards to bring her presents. Eventually, Sun is let out of solitary and rejoins her friends in the main prison. Sun is eventually almost hung by some guards bought off by her brother but she is saved by a fellow prisoner, and they both break out with the help of her cluster. She finds a safe house but is frequently chased by law enforcement, most notably, Detective Mun. It turns out that he is looking to indict her brother and grant Sun with freedom but does not have enough evidence. Sun chooses to go undercover at a gala, serving cocktails with the help of Lito to confront her brother. At the night of the gala, Mun also captures Joong-Ki but he shoots him in the stomach and gets away. Sun pursues him in a high speed chase and pins him on the floor, she does not kill him and is arrested while Joong-Ki is escorted away by a politician friend. With the help of Nomi, who rigs the traffic light system and gets the police bandwagon to topside, Sun escapes and is rescued by Puck, who is somehow is Korea, and they are escorted away.\n\n===Nomi Marks===\nPortrayed by [[Jamie Clayton]].<ref name=buzzfeed2/> John Babbo portrayed a young Nomi.\n\nA [[trans woman]] [[hacktivist]] and [[blog]]ger living in [[San Francisco]] with her girlfriend, Amanita (nicknamed Neets). At a [[gay pride|pride]] parade, Nomi falls unconscious. She ends up in the hospital, where her [[transphobia|transphobic]] mother tells her that she won't let Neets see her. Nomi's doctor, Dr. Metzger, tells them that her brain has an illness that compromises her sense of reality, and she will need an operation that is essentially lobotomy. Believing Nomi is mentally unstable, they keep her in the hospital against her will. Nomi eventually finds out that her \u201cdoctor\u201d works for BPO, an organization which hunts down sensates, owned by the series' villain, Whispers. Neets stages a breakout for Nomi, and the two begin investigating everything that's happening. They investigate the company, Dr. Metzger, his previous patients, and Whispers. The two find out that all of Dr. Metzger's previous patients who he had \u201cdiagnosed\u201d with the same fake illness were sensates from other clusters, and they have all been lobotomized by BPO to the point that they are waking brain death patients. Nomi also discovers that Whispers can make their lobotomized zombie-like bodies do his bidding when he needs to eliminate threats so she and Neets attempt to stay off the company's radar for a while. Fellow sensate Will gets in direct contact with Nomi, and she uses her hacking skills to help Will save another sensate named Riley.\n\nNow hiding from an FBI agent, Nomi and Neets eventually choose to move-in with her old hacking friend, Bug. She routinely helps out other sensates by being the eyes they cannot have by accessing security cameras in other rooms. She eventually gets tired of hiding from the FBI and gets a pass with the help of Bug. Bug gets the idea to give Nomi an 'E-death' meaning all her records and past crimes will be erased from the government records and she will be free. The E-death successfully works and she is finally able to be the maid of honour at her sister's wedding. During the ceremony however the FBI agent Bendix apprehends her, but without proof of warrant she is able to go free. At the end of season 2, Neets proposes to Nomi and in turn, Nomi proposes to Neets.\n\n===Kala Dandekar===\nPortrayed by [[Tina Desai]].<ref name=buzzfeed2/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vogue.in/content/tina-desai-makes-her-international-tv-debut |title=Tina Desai makes her international TV debut |author=Anjan Sachar |date=April 29, 2015 |work=[[Vogue India]] |accessdate=April 30, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507132834/http://www.vogue.in/content/tina-desai-makes-her-international-tv-debut/ |archivedate=May 7, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref> Yashvi Nagar portrayed a young Kala.\n\nA university-educated pharmacist and devout [[Hindu]] in [[Mumbai]] engaged to marry a man she does not love. Her sensate cluster is born while she is stressed about her impending wedding. Through her new powers, Kala meets her fellow sensate Wolfgang. The two talk constantly, and Kala realizes she is beginning to fall in love with him. However, she was told on multiple occasions by Wolfgang to marry Rajan instead and forget about him, deeming himself as a monster just like his father and uncle. Kala often goes to the Temple of [[Ganesha]] to bring offerings and pray for advice. One day while visiting, she discovers her fianc\u00e9's father is trying to get the Indian government to enact a law that will restrict Hindu religious practice, which angered many fellow worshippers. After fainting at her own wedding by Wolfgang's nudity, she is later confronted by Rajan's father at the Temple of Ganesha to refuse the marriage where he is left in a coma after being stabbed by hooded figures. Kala's on-the-fly thinking and chemistry skills help free Riley, in the season one finale, from Whispers.\n\nWhile on their honeymoon in Italy, Rajan confronts Kala about being a virgin, which makes her paranoid. While she does eventually decide to have sex with him, she is interrupted by Wolfgang, and does not go through with it. She spontaneously meets Ajay, one of Rajan's friends at an Art Gallery where they share a fondness for deity artwork. The battle for religious freedom is still an issue and Kala is still associated with the religious extremists, the crowd she does not want to be associated with. Rajan appears to be harboring secrets of his own and takes a trip to Paris, when it is revealed that he is investigating a political corruption case of Ajay and asks Kala to be escorted to a safe-house in Paris. Hoping to meet up with Wolfgang, she agrees until Wolfgang is taken by Whispers.\n\n===Riley Blue===\n<!-- (n\u00e9e Gunnarsd\u00f3ttir) -->\nPortrayed by [[Tuppence Middleton]].<ref name=buzzfeed2/> Katrin Sara Olafsdottir portrayed a young Riley.\n\nAn [[Iceland]]ic DJ living in [[London]] who is trying to escape a troubled past. Riley begins the series by accidentally diving deep into the world of London's drug trade, and has many psychic encounters with Will, a sensate who is a part of her cluster. The two fall in love with each other. She finds that she cannot escape her tragic past and goes home to Iceland to confront it and reunite with her father, who is a famous Icelandic pianist. It is there that Riley's backstory is revealed. She was married once to a man named Magnus and was pregnant with his child. On the way to the hospital to give birth, a snowstorm hits and Magnus accidentally drives off the road. Her husband dies in the car crash and she is stuck in the overturned car. Her water breaks and she has to give birth in the wilderness. She takes her baby and tries to get to safety, but ultimately, her daughter freezes to death. In the present, Riley is haunted by survivor's guilt. While at her father's classical music concert, she falls unconscious and is taken to the hospital. Her unique brain scans garner the attention of the series\u2019 villain Whispers, who leads an organization that hunts down sensates, and he abducts her. Aware of what is happening, Will goes to Iceland and uses his skills and those of other sensates to break her out. Before they escape however, Will looks into Whispers' eyes, which gives Whispers the ability to see and hear through Will's perspective. Riley helps Will use drugs to knock him unconscious to avoid Whispers learning their location. With this strategy, the two successfully escape, using a boat belonging to Riley's friend Sven to get out to sea.\n\nDue to Whispers' being able to see through Will, she must constantly inject him with drugs to prevent the psychic link to revealing their location. Riley takes care of Will while in hiding and eventually the two decide to go to Chicago to visit Will's father.\n\n===Wolfgang Bogdanow===\nPortrayed by [[Max Riemelt]].<ref name=buzzfeed2/> Lenius Jung portrayed a young Wolfgang in season 1, Mathis Wernecke a younger Wolfgang in season 2 et Lasse Bergmann a younger Wolfgang in the series finale.\n\nA [[Berlin]] locksmith and [[safe-cracker]] who has unresolved problems with his late father and participates in organized crime. One night, he and his best friend Felix decide to rob Steiner, Wolfgang's cousin and enemy, of his most prized possession, a set of outstandingly expensive jewels. The two successfully rob him, and begin looking for buyers. While using some of their newfound fortune to go on a shopping spree, Felix is shot by the Steiner's men and is put into a coma. Throughout the series, the sensate who Wolfgang bonds the most with is Kala. Over time, the two fall in love. Wolfgang confronts and kills Steiner and his men with Lito's help, causing Sergei, Steiner's father and Wolfgang's uncle, to seek revenge. Wolfgang goes to Sergei's home to kill him and, with the help of Will and Kala, defeats all his men. Although, Sergei is left defenseless, wounded, and alone, Wolfgang shows no mercy, shooting him multiple times in the head. He then tells Kala that they cannot be together, because Wolfgang claims he is a monster. Wolfgang's skillful ruthlessness aids Will when Riley is kidnapped by Whispers.\n\nWolfgang is told that his actions may cause a dynastic war between Berlin's most powerful families. Sure enough, he is ambushed on New Year's, but he and Felix, who has woken up from his coma, survive thanks to the help of the other sensates.\n\n===Lito Rodr\u00edguez===\nPortrayed by [[Miguel \u00c1ngel Silvestre]].<ref name=buzzfeed2/> Ramiro Cid portrayed a young Lito.\n\nA [[closeted]] actor living in [[Mexico City]] with his boyfriend Hernando.<ref name=buzzfeed2/> Lito is pursued by his costar Daniela, whom he is using to make the public believe he is straight. One night, a tipsy Daniela visits his apartment, wishing to sleep with him and threatening to call the press in order to manipulate him into allowing her inside. Alone, Lito and Hernando reveal to her that they are lovers. She then agrees to help them keep this secret and quickly becomes one of their closest friends, sometimes participating with them sexually. While filming a movie, he meets the film's producer, whom he recognizes as Daniela's abusive ex-boyfriend and stalker, Joaqu\u00edn. Later, Joaqu\u00edn shows up at Lito's apartment, drunk and crying, and manages to steal Daniela's phone, which contains pictures of Lito and Hernando having sex. He threatens to reveal them to the public. Daniela wishes to protect Lito and Hernando and agrees to go back with Joaqu\u00edn to prevent him from leaking the photos. Lito agrees to let Daniela do this. Hernando disagrees with the decision, becomes resentful of Lito for allowing Daniela to go back to her abuser, and breaks up with him. While grieving, Lito realizes he should not have let Daniela go back and decides to rescue her. He goes to Joaqu\u00edn's house and channels Wolfgang's aggression, beating Joaqu\u00edn to a pulp and taking Daniela home. After this, the three are reunited and he and Hernando get back together. Will is able to use Lito's acting skills to lie while in Whispers' facility.\n\nAfter rescuing Daniela, Joaqu\u00edn leaks the photos of Lito and Hernando to the world, ruining his career. He and Lito are evicted from their apartment, but Daniela allows them to stay with her.\n\n===Will Gorski===\nPortrayed by [[Brian J. Smith]].<ref name=buzzfeed2/> [[Maxwell Jenkins]] portrayed a young Will.\n\nA [[Chicago Police Department|Chicago police officer]] haunted by an unsolved murder from his childhood. When the series begins, he tells his partner Diego about his supernatural experiences although he doesn't believe him. He begins investigating the unreported murder of Angelica, who keeps appearing to him in visions. Most of his initial sensate interactions are with fellow cluster-member Riley Blue and the two begin to fall in love. Soon Jonas Maliki, a sensate from Angelica's cluster, confronts Will in person about his role as a sensate. Will responds by turning Jonas in to the police and is viewed as a hero in his precinct. He begins to learn more about the other sensates in his cluster and how to utilize his new abilities. Eventually, he discovers that Riley has been captured by the series villain Whispers, whom Jonas has warned him about. According to Jonas, if Will looks into Whispers eyes, he will be able to see everything that he sees. Whispers is holding Riley in a private facility in Iceland, where she is to be experimented on. Will goes to Iceland and uses his skills, as well as the other sensates\u2019 abilities, to save Riley. During their escape, however, Will accidentally looks into Whispers' eyes. Far from the facility, Will injects himself with drugs to lose consciousness to ensure that Whispers does not find them. Riley helps them successfully escape and gets Will to safety.\n\nBecause Whispers can now see through him, Will constantly inject himself with drugs in order to reduce Whispers' psychic influence. When awake, Will and Riley grow much closer. On Christmas Day, however, Whispers reveals to Will that his father has resumed drinking and is severely depressed without him. Will feels guilty, and Riley tells him they will go visit his father together.\n\n==Other series regulars==\n===Amanita \"Neets\" Caplan===\nPortrayed by [[Freema Agyeman]].<ref name=buzzfeed2/>\n\nNomi's girlfriend, who later becomes an ally for the new sensates.\n\n===Whispers===\nPortrayed by [[Terrence Mann]].<ref name=buzzfeed/>\n\nA sensate who turned against his own kind for unknown reasons and leads an organization determined to neutralize or kill sensates.

Angelica Turing \"gave birth\" to this cluster shortly before her suicide. Jonas Maliki acts as their mentor. Throughout the first season, the sensates' new powers confuse them, as they frequently visit each other with no control via their newfound psychic link. Over the course of the season, they each get to know each other, eventually gaining more control over their abilities. By the end of season one, they may all visit each other and share their abilities at will, with everyone aiding Will when Riley is captured by the series' main villain, Whispers. During \"A Christmas Special\", they are all shown to be close friends now, frequently visiting the others, even when it's just to talk.\n\n===Capheus \"Van Damme\" Onyango===\nPortrayed by [[Aml Ameen]] in the first season and [[Toby Onwumere]] in the second.<ref name=buzzfeed2/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.voice-online.co.uk/article/aml-ameen-london-boys-amazing-journey |title=Aml Ameen: The London boy's amazing journey |author=Natricia Duncan |date=October 18, 2014 |work=[[The Voice (British newspaper)|The Voice]] |publisher=GV Media Group |accessdate=October 20, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507131933/http://www.voice-online.co.uk/article/aml-ameen-london-boys-amazing-journey |archivedate=May 7, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite interview |url=http://www.jetmag.com/entertainment/aml-ameen/ |title=Aml Ameen on 'The Maze Runner' & More |subject=Aml Ameen |subjectlink=Aml Ameen |interviewer=L'Oreal Thompson |date=September 19, 2014 |work=[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]] |publisher=[[Johnson Publishing Company|Ebony Media Operations]] |accessdate=October 19, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507132438/http://www.jetmag.com/entertainment/aml-ameen/ |archivedate=May 7, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"recast\">{{cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2016/04/sense8-aml-ameen-toby-onwumere-recasting-wachowski-netflix-series-1201744886/ |title='Sense8': Aml Ameen Replaced By Toby Onwumere In Wachowskis' Netflix Series |date=April 26, 2016 |publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]] |author1=Nellie Andreeva |author2=Mike Fleming Jr |work=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |accessdate=April 27, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507132635/http://deadline.com/2016/04/sense8-aml-ameen-toby-onwumere-recasting-wachowski-netflix-series-1201744886/ |archivedate=May 7, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite tweet |number=755437703467036672 |user=toby_onwumere |title=Game time. |date=July 19, 2016 |author=Toby Onwumere |accessdate=August 8, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808180202/https://twitter.com/toby_onwumere/status/755437703467036672 |archivedate=August 8, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref> Gabriel Ouma portrayed a young Capheus.\n\nMain skills and traits: endlessly optimistic outlook, inspiring positivity, unwavering moral advice, and expert driving skills.\n\nA [[matatu]] driver in [[Nairobi]], and a passionate fan of [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]] who is trying to earn money to buy [[AIDS]] medicine for his mother. Capheus owns his bus matatu business with his best friend Jela. Their business is failing, however, in competition with another matatu. One day, they drive through a shady part of a nearby city, where they are ambushed by a local warlord's men, who take their money and the medicine Capheus has bought for his mother. Capheus goes after them, and is about to be killed when he channels Sun, a sensate in his cluster with intensive kickboxing training, and who Capheus at first believes is the spirit of Van Damme. With her skills, they defeat the men, and his fighting skills gain his matatu business popularity, and draws the attention of Silas Kabaka, one of Nairobi's most powerful crime lords. He hires Capheus to drive his daughter Amondi every day to a CDC center for cancer treatment, as he cannot send his men to do it without drawing attention to her. When Silas is captured by his enemies, Capheus decides to save him, once again channeling Sun to defeat the men, saving Silas and reuniting him with his daughter. Capheus' driving skills often come in handy for the other sensates, and he is able to use this to help Nomi escape Whispers' men by taking over the drive through the streets of San Francisco.\n\nHis matatu is irreparable after his heist to save Silas, but Silas repays him by buying him a new one. Because of his reputation for taking down the superpower, his business is booming, and people begin seeing him as something of an idol. He is later approached to run for office, and run against the current politically corrupt president. His messages of hope and power ring true to the people in Nairobi however he is still targeted at one major rally and by people that think he is reckless. Silas even endorses him but it later turns out he is in love with Capheus' mother. After one rally goes terribly with riots breaking out as well as his staff turning against him, he is saved by the Superpower gang. He is also determined to quit, but his message and speeches go viral.\n\n===Sun Bak===\nPortrayed by [[Bae Doona|Doona Bae]].<ref name=buzzfeed2/> Jaein Lee (credited as Jane Lee in season 1) portrayed a young Sun.\n\nThe daughter of a powerful [[Seoul]] businessman and a burgeoning star in the underground [[kickboxing]] world, with a master's degree in economics. When Sun's brother Joong-Ki is caught embezzling, Sun\u2019s father asks her to take the blame before the police and court find out, as Sun is already looked down upon by their partners for being a woman. Remembering her deceased mother's words to always look out for her brother, Sun agrees, and goes to jail for a crime she didn't commit. She becomes unpopular when she looks out for a woman who is often bullied by the other inmates. Sun helps her get revenge on the women picking on her, leading them to ambush Sun in the courtyard. Sun easily fends them off, but is locked in solitary confinement for fighting. Soon afterwards, her father comes to visit her, telling her that she has been a better child than her brother ever was, and that he will come forward about who really committed the crimes, as he wishes to free Sun. The next day however, Sun's brother visits and tells her that their father killed himself the night before. Sun is quickly able to realize that Joong-Ki killed their father after realizing he would come forward and that he would end up in jail. Sun is arguably the most useful of the sensates and is considered 'the muscle.' She often comes to rescue others in the cluster with her kickboxing skills whenever they are cornered, and especially when Will goes to free Riley from Whispers. She has the strongest bond with Capheus, and interacts with him the most.\n\nDuring the next few months, Sun frequently visits the other sensates to escape from solitary confinement, while the women she defended bribe the guards to bring her presents. Eventually, Sun is let out of solitary and rejoins her friends in the main prison. Sun is eventually almost hung by some guards bought off by her brother but she is saved by a fellow prisoner, and they both break out with the help of her cluster. She finds a safe house but is frequently chased by law enforcement, most notably, Detective Mun. It turns out that he is looking to indict her brother and grant Sun with freedom but does not have enough evidence. Sun chooses to go undercover at a gala, serving cocktails with the help of Lito to confront her brother. At the night of the gala, Mun also captures Joong-Ki but he shoots him in the stomach and gets away. Sun pursues him in a high speed chase and pins him on the floor, she does not kill him and is arrested while Joong-Ki is escorted away by a politician friend. With the help of Nomi, who rigs the traffic light system and gets the police bandwagon to topside, Sun escapes and is rescued by Puck, who is somehow is Korea, and they are escorted away.\n\n===Nomi Marks===\nPortrayed by [[Jamie Clayton]].<ref name=buzzfeed2/> John Babbo portrayed a young Nomi.\n\nA [[trans woman]] [[hacktivist]] and [[blog]]ger living in [[San Francisco]] with her girlfriend, Amanita (nicknamed Neets). At a [[gay pride|pride]] parade, Nomi falls unconscious. She ends up in the hospital, where her [[transphobia|transphobic]] mother tells her that she won't let Neets see her. Nomi's doctor, Dr. Metzger, tells them that her brain has an illness that compromises her sense of reality, and she will need an operation that is essentially lobotomy. Believing Nomi is mentally unstable, they keep her in the hospital against her will. Nomi eventually finds out that her \u201cdoctor\u201d works for BPO, an organization which hunts down sensates, owned by the series' villain, Whispers. Neets stages a breakout for Nomi, and the two begin investigating everything that's happening. They investigate the company, Dr. Metzger, his previous patients, and Whispers. The two find out that all of Dr. Metzger\u2019s previous patients who he had \u201cdiagnosed\u201d with the same fake illness were sensates from other clusters, and they have all been lobotomized by BPO to the point that they are waking brain death patients. Nomi also discovers that Whispers can make their lobotomized zombie-like bodies do his bidding when he needs to eliminate threats so she and Neets attempt to stay off the company's radar for a while. Fellow sensate Will gets in direct contact with Nomi, and she uses her hacking skills to help Will save another sensate named Riley.\n\nNow hiding from an FBI agent, Nomi and Neets eventually choose to move-in with her old hacking friend, Bug. She routinely helps out other sensates by being the eyes they cannot have by accessing security cameras in other rooms. She eventually gets tired of hiding from the FBI and gets a pass with the help of Bug. Bug gets the idea to give Nomi an 'E-death' meaning all her records and past crimes will be erased from the government records and she will be free. The E-death successfully works and she is finally able to be the maid of honour at her sister's wedding. During the ceremony however the FBI agent Bendix apprehends her, but without proof of warrant she is able to go free. At the end of season 2, Neets proposes to Nomi and in turn, Nomi proposes to Neets.\n\n===Kala Dandekar===\nPortrayed by [[Tina Desai]].<ref name=buzzfeed2/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vogue.in/content/tina-desai-makes-her-international-tv-debut |title=Tina Desai makes her international TV debut |author=Anjan Sachar |date=April 29, 2015 |work=[[Vogue India]] |accessdate=April 30, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507132834/http://www.vogue.in/content/tina-desai-makes-her-international-tv-debut/ |archivedate=May 7, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref> Yashvi Nagar portrayed a young Kala.\n\nA university-educated pharmacist and devout [[Hindu]] in [[Mumbai]] engaged to marry a man she does not love. Her sensate cluster is born while she is stressed about her impending wedding. Through her new powers, Kala meets her fellow sensate Wolfgang. The two talk constantly, and Kala realizes she is beginning to fall in love with him. However, she was told on multiple occasions by Wolfgang to marry Rajan instead and forget about him, deeming himself as a monster just like his father and uncle. Kala often goes to the Temple of [[Ganesha]] to bring offerings and pray for advice. One day while visiting, she discovers her fianc\u00e9\u2019s father is trying to get the Indian government to enact a law that will restrict Hindu religious practice, which angered many fellow worshippers. After fainting at her own wedding by Wolfgang's nudity, she is later confronted by Rajan's father at the Temple of Ganesha to refuse the marriage where he is left in a coma after being stabbed by hooded figures. Kala's on-the-fly thinking and chemistry skills help free Riley, in the season one finale, from Whispers.\n\nWhile on their honeymoon in Italy, Rajan confronts Kala about being a virgin, which makes her paranoid. While she does eventually decide to have sex with him, she is interrupted by Wolfgang, and does not go through with it. She spontaneously meets Ajay, one of Rajan's friends at an Art Gallery where they share a fondness for deity artwork. The battle for religious freedom is still an issue and Kala is still associated with the religious extremists, the crowd she does not want to be associated with. Rajan appears to be harboring secrets of his own and takes a trip to Paris, when it is revealed that he is investigating a political corruption case of Ajay and asks Kala to be escorted to a safe-house in Paris. Hoping to meet up with Wolfgang, she agrees until Wolfgang is taken by Whispers.\n\n===Riley Blue===\n<!-- (n\u00e9e Gunnarsd\u00f3ttir) -->\nPortrayed by [[Tuppence Middleton]].<ref name=buzzfeed2/> Katrin Sara Olafsdottir portrayed a young Riley.\n\nAn [[Iceland]]ic DJ living in [[London]] who is trying to escape a troubled past. Riley begins the series by accidentally diving deep into the world of London's drug trade, and has many psychic encounters with Will, a sensate who is a part of her cluster. The two fall in love with each other. She finds that she cannot escape her tragic past and goes home to Iceland to confront it and reunite with her father, who is a famous Icelandic pianist. It is there that Riley's backstory is revealed. She was married once to a man named Magnus and was pregnant with his child. On the way to the hospital to give birth, a snowstorm hits and Magnus accidentally drives off the road. Her husband dies in the car crash and she is stuck in the overturned car. Her water breaks and she has to give birth in the wilderness. She takes her baby and tries to get to safety, but ultimately, her daughter freezes to death. In the present, Riley is haunted by survivor's guilt. While at her father\u2019s classical music concert, she falls unconscious and is taken to the hospital. Her unique brain scans garner the attention of the series\u2019 villain Whispers, who leads an organization that hunts down sensates, and he abducts her. Aware of what is happening, Will goes to Iceland and uses his skills and those of other sensates to break her out. Before they escape however, Will looks into Whispers' eyes, which gives Whispers the ability to see and hear through Will\u2019s perspective. Riley helps Will use drugs to knock him unconscious to avoid Whispers learning their location. With this strategy, the two successfully escape, using a boat belonging to Riley's friend Sven to get out to sea.\n\nDue to Whispers' being able to see through Will, she must constantly inject him with drugs to prevent the psychic link to revealing their location. Riley takes care of Will while in hiding and eventually the two decide to go to Chicago to visit Will's father.\n\n===Wolfgang Bogdanow===\nPortrayed by [[Max Riemelt]].<ref name=buzzfeed2/> Lenius Jung portrayed a young Wolfgang in season 1, Mathis Wernecke a younger Wolfgang in season 2 et Lasse Bergmann a younger Wolfgang in the series finale.\n\nA [[Berlin]] locksmith and [[safe-cracker]] who has unresolved problems with his late father and participates in organized crime. One night, he and his best friend Felix decide to rob Steiner, Wolfgang\u2019s cousin and enemy, of his most prized possession, a set of outstandingly expensive jewels. The two successfully rob him, and begin looking for buyers. While using some of their newfound fortune to go on a shopping spree, Felix is shot by the Steiner\u2019s men and is put into a coma. Throughout the series, the sensate who Wolfgang bonds the most with is Kala. Over time, the two fall in love. Wolfgang confronts and kills Steiner and his men with Lito\u2019s help, causing Sergei, Steiner\u2019s father and Wolfgang's uncle, to seek revenge. Wolfgang goes to Sergei\u2019s home to kill him and, with the help of Will and Kala, defeats all his men. Although, Sergei is left defenseless, wounded, and alone, Wolfgang shows no mercy, shooting him multiple times in the head. He then tells Kala that they cannot be together, because Wolfgang claims he is a monster. Wolfgang's skillful ruthlessness aids Will when Riley is kidnapped by Whispers.\n\nWolfgang is told that his actions may cause a dynastic war between Berlin's most powerful families. Sure enough, he is ambushed on New Year's, but he and Felix, who has woken up from his coma, survive thanks to the help of the other sensates.\n\n===Lito Rodr\u00edguez===\nPortrayed by [[Miguel \u00c1ngel Silvestre]].<ref name=buzzfeed2/> Ramiro Cid portrayed a young Lito.\n\nA [[closeted]] actor living in [[Mexico City]] with his boyfriend Hernando.<ref name=buzzfeed2/> Lito is pursued by his costar Daniela, whom he is using to make the public believe he is straight. One night, a tipsy Daniela visits his apartment, wishing to sleep with him and threatening to call the press in order to manipulate him into allowing her inside. Alone, Lito and Hernando reveal to her that they are lovers. She then agrees to help them keep this secret and quickly becomes one of their closest friends, sometimes participating with them sexually. While filming a movie, he meets the film's producer, whom he recognizes as Daniela's abusive ex-boyfriend and stalker, Joaqu\u00edn. Later, Joaqu\u00edn shows up at Lito's apartment, drunk and crying, and manages to steal Daniela's phone, which contains pictures of Lito and Hernando having sex. He threatens to reveal them to the public. Daniela wishes to protect Lito and Hernando and agrees to go back with Joaqu\u00edn to prevent him from leaking the photos. Lito agrees to let Daniela do this. Hernando disagrees with the decision, becomes resentful of Lito for allowing Daniela to go back to her abuser, and breaks up with him. While grieving, Lito realizes he should not have let Daniela go back and decides to rescue her. He goes to Joaqu\u00edn's house and channels Wolfgang's aggression, beating Joaqu\u00edn to a pulp and taking Daniela home. After this, the three are reunited and he and Hernando get back together. Will is able to use Lito's acting skills to lie while in Whispers' facility.\n\nAfter rescuing Daniela, Joaqu\u00edn leaks the photos of Lito and Hernando to the world, ruining his career. He and Lito are evicted from their apartment, but Daniela allows them to stay with her.\n\n===Will Gorski===\nPortrayed by [[Brian J. Smith]].<ref name=buzzfeed2/> [[Maxwell Jenkins]] portrayed a young Will.\n\nA [[Chicago Police Department|Chicago police officer]] haunted by an unsolved murder from his childhood. When the series begins, he tells his partner Diego about his supernatural experiences although he doesn't believe him. He begins investigating the unreported murder of Angelica, who keeps appearing to him in visions. Most of his initial sensate interactions are with fellow cluster-member Riley Blue and the two begin to fall in love. Soon Jonas Maliki, a sensate from Angelica\u2019s cluster, confronts Will in person about his role as a sensate. Will responds by turning Jonas in to the police and is viewed as a hero in his precinct. He begins to learn more about the other sensates in his cluster and how to utilize his new abilities. Eventually, he discovers that Riley has been captured by the series villain Whispers, whom Jonas has warned him about. According to Jonas, if Will looks into Whispers eyes, he will be able to see everything that he sees. Whispers is holding Riley in a private facility in Iceland, where she is to be experimented on. Will goes to Iceland and uses his skills, as well as the other sensates\u2019 abilities, to save Riley. During their escape, however, Will accidentally looks into Whispers' eyes. Far from the facility, Will injects himself with drugs to lose consciousness to ensure that Whispers does not find them. Riley helps them successfully escape and gets Will to safety.\n\nBecause Whispers can now see through him, Will constantly inject himself with drugs in order to reduce Whispers' psychic influence.

{"title_page": "Walls of Genoa", "text_new": "[[File:Le torri di Porta Soprana, Genova.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Porta Soprana is the best-known gate of the ancient walls of Genoa. After major restorations carried out between the 19th and 20th centuries, it has regained the appearance it supposedly had at the time of the construction of the so-called Barbarossa walls (1150 ca.).]]\nThe '''walls of Genoa''' (''mura di Genova'' in [[Italian language|Italian]], ''miage de Zena'' in [[Ligurian (Romance language)|Ligurian]]) constitute in their whole the several circles of walls that protected and defended the city of [[Genoa]], former capital of the [[Republic of Genoa|homonimous Republic]]. To this day, large portions of these walls remain, and Genoa has more and longer walls than any other city in Italy.\n\n==Ancient walls==\n===Ancient era and Middle Ages===\n[[File:muragenova3.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Map of the city walls at the end of 10th century]]\nIn [[ancient Rome|Roman times]] the original centre of Genoa, on the Sarzano hill, may have been defended by a wall, but there is no archaeological or documentary evidence of its existence.\n\nThe first known city walls were built in the 9th century, when thanks to [[Berengar II of Italy]], the city gained wide autonomy, with subsequent economic development and a population increase.\nThe first walls, which included Sarzano hill, had three [[city gate|gates]]: the Serravalle gate, at the north side of the church of San Lorenzo, another on the hill of Saint Andrew, near the site of the future Porta Soprana, and another one at the end of \u201cVia Canneto il curto\u201d, near the church of San Peter.\n\nThe settlement enclosed by the walls and the coastline occupied about twenty-two [[hectares]].\nSome small settlements (housing  mainly workmen and artisans), which had grown around churches, monasteries, and feudal palaces, remained outside the walls.\n\n===Barbarossa walls===\n[[File:mura4.jpg|thumb|300px|Map of the \u201c[[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Barbarossa]] walls\u201d]]\nIn 1155, this defensive wall was extended to the northwest to include the new settlements outside the walls. The walls culminated on the top of St. Andrew hill, with Porta Soprana.\n\nThe new walls greatly expanded the area contained within, compared to the previous one, including an area of 55 hectares.\n\nThe construction of the walls dragged until 1163; in that year, the international political situation and particularly relations with emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] led to an acceleration of work, as attested to by [[Caffaro di Rustico da Caschifellone|Caffaro]], and the work  was completed in 53 days thanks to the effort of the entire population.\n\nThe three main gates had a monumental look, with high semicircular towers. Two of them survive to this day: \u201cPorta Soprana\u201d and \u201cPorta dei Vacca\u201d; the third one, Porta Aurea (\"Golden Gate\"), already partially demolished in the 18th century, was completely demolished in the second half of the 20th century. In the 13th century, the Old Pier peninsula, at the southern limit of the port, was also included inside the walls, thus completing the fortifications on the sea side of the city.\n\n===The 14th century expansion===\n[[File:muragenova5.jpg|thumb|300px|Map of the city walls in the 14th century]]\nIn the 14th century, urban expansion of the city, caused by the increase in commercial activity, led to a new extension of walls to encompass the new quarters which stood to the west and east of the original city centre.\n\nBetween 1320 and 1327, the east side of the walls was extended to include Carignano Hill, passing where now are the esplanade of Acquasola and the Monumental Bridge. This wall section had two gates: Porta dell'Acquasola and Porta degli Archi.\nHence, the ancient walls, still visible, continue with the names of Mura of Santa Chiara, Mura del Prato, and Mura delle Cappuccine, ending with a cliff overlooking the sea.\n\nFrom 1347 and 1350, another extension was built toward the west, from the fort of  Castelletto to the new St. Thomas Gate, near the present Principe railway station. This stretch of walls included a series of towers and gates which no longer exist (Carbonara, Pietraminuta, St. George, the above-mentioned St. Thomas Gate, and another tower in the place where today stands [[Castello d'Albertis]]). After this enlargement, the city wall ran for 4,550 meters, containing an area of 155 hectares.\n\n===The walls in the 16th century===\nIn the 16th century, the walls were no longer able to withstand an attack by modern firearms, so they were modified to create new [[Star fort]]s.\n\n[[File:muragenova6.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Map of the 16th-century walls with the new curtains and gates along the port area]]\nIn 1528, [[Andrea Doria]] placed the [[Republic of Genoa]] under the protection of the Spaniards. Fearing the possibility of new attacks by the French army, he promoted the modernization of the city walls, projected by {{Interlanguage link multi|Giovanni Maria Olgiati|it}} and carried out in the third decade of the 16th century. The \u201cBarbarossa walls\u201d and their 14th-century extensions were modernized by replacing the old square towers with triangular [[bastion]]s and building new [[Curtain wall (fortification)|curtains]] with a [[counterscarp]] profile.\n[[File:Genova-DSCF7928.JPG|thumb|left|Porta Siberia, designed by [[Galeazzo Alessi]].]]\nA set of walls was also built along the sea, including the entire shoreline between the St. Thomas Gate and the Molo Vecchio (Old Pier). In this stretch of wall, new gates were created, one for each pier of the port.\nAt the end of Molo Vecchio in the second half of the century, [[Galeazzo Alessi]] designed Porta Siberia, an example of Renaissance military architecture. From here, the walls are linked to those already existing on the sea side of  Sarzano and Carignano hills, and they reach the mouth of [[Bisagno (stream)|Bisagno stream]].\nOf the three main gates of  the 16th-century walls, Porta Siberia and the Porta degli Archi (moved from the original location for the opening of Via XX Settembre) still stand today, while the St. Thomas Gate was demolished to build the Principe railway station.\n\n==The Mura Nuove (New Walls)==\n[[File:Mura Nuove Genova.jpg|thumb|300px|Map of Genoa with the New Walls]]\nThe \u201cMura Nuove\u201d (New Walls) are the last and most imposing walls built along the ridge of the hills encircling downtown Genoa, and were built in the first half of the 17th century.\n\nThe view of Genoa from the sea is characterized by the line of New Walls with their fortifications, on the ridge of the hills, above the hilly quarters which grew after  World War II; coming from the north, by train or car, the first visible structure is the mass of Fort Diamante, high on the mount on the left bank of the [[Val Polcevera]], and the Fort Fratello Minore. Shortly after, on the ridge in the distance is Fort Begato, included in the line of bastions that rise up to the top of Mount Peralto, where sits Fort Sperone with its high walls.\n\nThe \u201cNew Walls\u201d, the last and largest city walls, were built starting in 1626, after the repeated attempts of [[Charles Emmanuel I of Savoy]] to invade Genoa had convinced the government of the need for new and more powerful defensive walls.\n\nAlthough this defensive wall had already been suggested in 1568, the government of [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]] began the work in 1626, following the failed attack on 10 May  1625 of a French-Piedmontese army at the Pertuso Pass (where, in memory of the event, was later built the Shrine of Nostra Signora della Vittoria, meaning \"Our Lady of Victory\").\n\nIn less than four years, between 1629 and 1633, an army of diggers, bricklayers, and stonemasons (eight hundred, according to some sources, even three thousand according to others), divided into twenty-eight teams, raised curtains and bastions along the two ridges overlooking the valleys of Polcevera and Bisagno.\n\nThe project was carried out by mathematicians [[Vincenzo Maculano]] and  [[Giovanni Battista Baliani]], a friend of [[Galileo Galilei]].\nSupervision of the work was entrusted to Ansaldo De Mari with the cooperation of the Lombard architect [[Bartolomeo Bianco]]<ref>Bartolomeo Bianco projected in Genoa some of Via Balbi palaces and worked with De Mari also to the walls of [[Vado Ligure]].</ref>\n[[File:Genova Bastione Mura Begato.jpg|thumb|left|A [[bastion]] of the Begato walls]]\nThe \u201cNew Walls\u201d extended for almost twenty kilometers, of which seven were along the coastline. Their construction caused the  incorporation of the quarter of San Teodoro within the walls. The walls, seen from above, have a triangular shape, the vertices being Mount Peralto, the lighthouse, and the mouth of the Bisagno stream.\n\nFortifications beginning from the [[Lighthouse of Genoa]] climb Granarolo Hill then reach mount Peralto, where the curtains overlooking Val Polcevera and those overlooking Val Bisagno meet; then they descend the plain along the final stretch of the Bisagno, protected by powerful bastions known as \u201cFronti Basse\u201d.\nThe waterfront was completed to defend the coastline from the lighthouse up to the western limit of the old walls (St. Thomas Gate).\n\nThis  structure was built on the hills even on steep slopes, in areas still sparsely populated today. This has contributed to their preservation, while the sections closest to the city were mostly demolished for the construction of new quarters and other infrastructure.\n\nThe length of the \u201cNew Walls\u201d reached 19,560 meters, enclosing an area of 903 hectares (nearly five times the 197 [[hectares]] included in the \u201dold walls\u201d  until the 16th century).<ref>Riccardo Dellepiane, ''Mura e fortificazioni di Genova'', Nuova Editrice Genovese, Genoa, 1984 (reprinted in 2008, {{ISBN|978-88-88963-22-8}}), page 65</ref>\n\n===The Eastern ridge===\n[[File:Crinale levante.jpg|thumb|left|The Eastern ridge]]\nFrom Fort Sperone, after a short stretch towards the southeast (Peralto Walls), the walls meet Fort Castellaccio and then different section of walls, named \u201cChiappe\u201d, \u201cSant'Erasmo\u201d, \u201cSan Bernardino\u201d, and \u201cZerbino\u201d, ending above Brignole railway station. The section of walls which used to stand here, named \"Walls of  Montesano\", were demolished in the 19th century to allow construction of the railway station.\n\nThe city's urban expansion eastward in the last decades of the 19th century caused the demolition of one of the most powerful and evocative parts of the New Walls, the so-called \u201cFronti Basse\u201d, a huge rampart that ran straight, with two large bastions in the plain on the right bank of the Bisagno. This large structure linked the New Walls with the \u201cSixteenth century walls\u201d from the place where now stands the railway station, up to the \u201cWalls of Prato\u201d.\n\nIn the \"Fronti Basse\" there were two gates, the monumental  [[Porta Pila]] (by [[Bartolomeo Bianco]]), at the end of Via Giulia (due to the completion of Via XX Settembre the gate was moved behind Brignole station), and \"Porta Romana\", at the end of Via San Vincenzo, where the ancient road to the east quarters began.\n\n===The Western ridge===\n[[File:Crinale polcevera.jpg|thumb|300px|The Western ridge]]\nFrom the top of Mount Peralto, where Fort Sperone sits, walls come down towards the southwest in a straight line to Fort Begato, then continue to fall along the panoramic road which runs along the curtain walk, taking first the name \"Walls of  Granarolo\" near the gate of the same name, then \u201cWalls of  Monte Moro\u201d. After Fort Tenaglia, the walls continue as \"Walls of  Porta Murata\" to reach the \u201cAngeli Gate\u201d and the \u201cWalls of  Angeli\u201d, where nowadays they stop abruptly due to the excavation, in the 1930s, of San Benigno Hill, an imposing rocky ridge where formerly stood the church and monastery of  San Benigno, later turned into [[barracks]]. The \u201cwalls of  San Benigno\u201d ran along the ridge of this hill and went to the [[lighthouse of Genoa|lighthouse of Lanterna]] and the Lanterna Gate.\n[[File:View towards the lighthouse Genoa - 06512v.jpg|thumb|right|270px|View of  Genoa with San Benigno hill, its walls and barracks in an image from the 19th century]]\n\n===The waterfront===\n[[File:Lanterna di Genova-Porta Nuova-IMG 2561.JPG|thumb|left|150px|\u201cPorta Nuova\u201d, the 19th-century gate near the [[lighthouse of Genoa|Lanterna]]]]\nWith the 17th-century expansion, the walls along the coast were reinforced with new bastions and extended beyond St. Thomas Gate to Capo Faro, where they met those descending along the western ridge. Due to port expansion, most of the walls along the sea were demolished; only a short stretch survives, recently enhanced with a walk from the ferry terminal to the lighthouse. Close by the lighthouse there was the monumental Lantern Gate, projected by Antonio Ponsonelli, built in 1633, and demolished in 1830 following the construction of a new gate a short distance away, \u201cPorta Nuova\u201d (New Gate), which was better suited to increased traffic.\n\n===The fortresses===\nDuring the 18th century and the first half of the 19th, along the perimeter of the walls were built some fortifications, including Castellaccio, Sperone (on the top of Mount Peralto), Begato, and Tenaglia. Other forts were built in different periods on the hills outside the city walls and along the ridge on the left bank of Val Bisagno. Most of the Genoese fortifications (a total of 16) are still visible and some of them also visited.\n\nIn the second half of the 18th century, immediately after the [[Siege of Genoa (1747)|Austrian siege of 1747]], the fortifications were expanded with the construction of four fortresses external to the walls: Diamante, Quezzi, Richelieu, and Santa Tecla, designed  by French military engineers [[Jacques De Sicre]] and [[Pierre De Cotte]].\n\nDuring the [[siege of Genoa (1800)|siege of Genoa of April 1800]], these forts were the site of many harsh battles between French and Austrian armies.\n\nAfter the annexation of the Napoleonic [[Ligurian Republic]] to the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]], decided by the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1814, the Savoy government (1815\u20131840) built a series of forts, towers, and [[coastal batteries]], making Genoa the best equipped fortress in the Mediterranean. The designer of this last phase of construction of the Genoese fortifications was major Giulio D'Andreis.\n\nForts along the perimeter of the New Walls include:\n* Fort Castellaccio (including Torre Specola)\n* [[Fort Sperone]]\n* Fort Begato\n* Fort Tenaglia\n\nWestern Forts ([[Sampierdarena]]) include:\n* Fort Crocetta\n* Fort Belvedere (no longer existing)\n\nForts on the ridges north of the walls include:\n* Fort Pu\u00ecn\n* Fort Fratello Minore\n* Fort Fratello Maggiore (demolished in 1932)\n* Fort Diamante\n\nEastern Forts (Val Bisagno, Albaro):\n* Fort San Giuliano (now headquarters of the Provincial Command of the Carabinieri)\n* Fort San Martino\n* Fort Santa Tecla\n* Fort Quezzi\n* Fort Richelieu\n* Fort Monteratti\n\n[[File:Genova Forte Sperone 02.jpg|Fort Sperone|thumb |250px]]\n\n===19th-century towers===\nIn 1820, the Engineering Military Corps of the Kingdom of Sardinia started to build a set of towers,  external to the walls, similar to [[Martello tower]]s. \nA few years later, due to cost and low usefulness, their construction was stopped. Only three of them were completed: Torre Quezzi, Torre San Bernardino, and Torre Zerbino (the last one no longer existing).\nOthers still exist in the condition in which they were left when the work was stopped, missing the second floor and the roof.\n[[File:Genova Torre Granarolo.jpg|Granarolo tower|thumb|250px]]\n\n===New Walls today===\nThe new walls and forts, once the purposes for which they were planned were gone, were decommissioned from military property in 1914. After this date, some of these structures were used as warehouses, jails for prisoners of war during   [[World War I]], anti-aircraft emplacements, or houses for [[Emergency evacuation|evacuee]]s during  [[World War II]]. Others were given to private ownership or left abandoned. \nNowadays, although they are public property, their condition is not uniform: the main fortresses have recently been restored and may be visited on request, others, even if in a state of decay, are freely visited, and some of them host television or cellphone towers.\n\nThe only fort still used by a military institution is Fort San Giuliano, which overlooks Corso Italia, in the quarter of [[Albaro]], now headquarters of the Provincial Command of the [[Carabinieri]].\n\nThe \"New Walls\" and the forts are now included in the \"Parco Urbano delle Mura\" (City Park of Walls), having a surface of 876 hectares, which is the largest green \"lung\" of Genoa, and provides the possibility of different excursions of historic and wildlife interest.<ref>http://www.turismo.comune.genova.it/spip.php?article298</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{commons category|Walls of Genoa}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Stefano Finauri, ''Forti di Genova: storia, tecnica e architettura dei fortini difensivi'', Edizioni Servizi Editoriali, Genoa 2007, {{ISBN|978-88-89384-27-5}}\n* Riccardo Dellepiane, ''Mura e fortificazioni di Genova'', Nuova Editrice Genovese, Genoa 1984 (reprinted in 2008, {{ISBN|978-88-88963-22-8}})\n* Piera Melli, ''La citt\u00e0 ritrovata.

After major restorations carried out between the 19th and 20th centuries, it has regained the appearance it supposedly had at the time of the construction of the so-called Barbarossa walls (1150 ca.).]]\nThe '''walls of Genoa''' (''mura di Genova'' in [[Italian language|Italian]], ''miage de Zena'' in [[Ligurian (Romance language)|Ligurian]]) constitute in their whole the several circles of walls that protected and defended the city of [[Genoa]], former capital of the [[Republic of Genoa|homonimous Republic]]. To this day, large portions of these walls remain, and Genoa has more and longer walls than any other city in Italy.\n\n==Ancient walls==\n===Ancient era and Middle Ages===\n[[File:muragenova3.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Map of the city walls at the end of 10th century]]\nIn [[ancient Rome|Roman times]] the original centre of Genoa, on the Sarzano hill, may have been defended by a wall, but there is no archaeological or documentary evidence of its existence.\n\nThe first known city walls were built in the 9th century, when thanks to [[Berengar II of Italy]], the city gained wide autonomy, with subsequent economic development and a population increase.\nThe first walls, which included Sarzano hill, had three [[city gate|gates]]: the Serravalle gate, at the north side of the church of San Lorenzo, another on the hill of Saint Andrew, near the site of the future Porta Soprana, and another one at the end of \u201cVia Canneto il curto\u201d, near the church of San Peter.\n\nThe settlement enclosed by the walls and the coastline occupied about twenty-two [[hectares]].\nSome small settlements (housing  mainly workmen and artisans), which had grown around churches, monasteries, and feudal palaces, remained outside the walls.\n\n===Barbarossa walls===\n[[File:mura4.jpg|thumb|300px|Map of the \u201c[[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Barbarossa]] walls\u201d]]\nIn 1155, this defensive wall was extended to the northwest to include the new settlements outside the walls. The walls culminated on the top of St. Andrew hill, with Porta Soprana.\n\nThe new walls greatly expanded the area contained within, compared to the previous one, including an area of 55 hectares.\n\nThe construction of the walls dragged until 1163; in that year, the international political situation and particularly relations with emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] led to an acceleration of work, as attested to by [[Caffaro di Rustico da Caschifellone|Caffaro]], and the work  was completed in 53 days thanks to the effort of the entire population.\n\nThe three main gates had a monumental look, with high semicircular towers. Two of them survive to this day: \u201cPorta Soprana\u201d and \u201cPorta dei Vacca\u201d; the third one, Porta Aurea (\"Golden Gate\"), already partially demolished in the 18th century, was completely demolished in the second half of the 20th century. In the 13th century, the Old Pier peninsula, at the southern limit of the port, was also included inside the walls, thus completing the fortifications on the sea side of the city.\n\n===The 14th century expansion===\n[[File:muragenova5.jpg|thumb|300px|Map of the city walls in the 14th century]]\nIn the 14th century, urban expansion of the city, caused by the increase in commercial activity, led to a new extension of walls to encompass the new quarters which stood to the west and east of the original city centre.\n\nBetween 1320 and 1327, the east side of the walls was extended to include Carignano Hill, passing where now are the esplanade of Acquasola and the Monumental Bridge. This wall section had two gates: Porta dell'Acquasola and Porta degli Archi.\nHence, the ancient walls, still visible, continue with the names of Mura of Santa Chiara, Mura del Prato, and Mura delle Cappuccine, ending with a cliff overlooking the sea.\n\nFrom 1347 and 1350, another extension was built toward the west, from the fort of  Castelletto to the new St. Thomas Gate, near the present Principe railway station. This stretch of walls included a series of towers and gates which no longer exist (Carbonara, Pietraminuta, St. George, the above-mentioned St. Thomas Gate, and another tower in the place where today stands [[Castello d'Albertis]]). After this enlargement, the city wall ran for 4,550 meters, containing an area of 155 hectares.\n\n===The walls in the 16th century===\nIn the 16th century, the walls were no longer able to withstand an attack by modern firearms, so they were modified to create new [[Star fort]]s.\n\n[[File:muragenova6.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Map of the 16th-century walls with the new curtains and gates along the port area]]\nIn 1528, [[Andrea Doria]] placed the [[Republic of Genoa]] under the protection of the Spaniards.

The designer of this last phase of construction of the Genoese fortifications was major Giulio D'Andreis.\n\nForts along the perimeter of the New Walls include:\n* Fort Castellaccio (including Torre Specola)\n* [[Fort Sperone]]\n* Fort Begato\n* Fort Tenaglia\n\nWestern Forts ([[Sampierdarena]]) include:\n* Fort Crocetta\n* Fort Belvedere (no longer existing)\n\nForts on the ridges north of the walls include:\n* Fort Pu\u00ecn\n* Fort Fratello Minore\n* Fort Fratello Maggiore (demolished in 1932)\n* Fort Diamante\n\nEastern Forts (Val Bisagno, Albaro):\n* Fort San Giuliano (now headquarters of the Provincial Command of the Carabinieri)\n* Fort San Martino\n* Fort Santa Tecla\n* Fort Quezzi\n* Fort Richelieu\n* Fort Monteratti\n\n[[File:Genova Forte Sperone 02.jpg|Fort Sperone|thumb |250px]]\n\n===19th-century towers===\nIn 1820, the Engineering Military Corps of the Kingdom of Sardinia started to build a set of towers,  external to the walls, similar to [[Martello tower]]s. \nA few years later, due to cost and low usefulness, their construction was stopped. Only three of them were completed: Torre Quezzi, Torre San Bernardino, and Torre Zerbino (the last one no longer existing).\nOthers still exist in the condition in which they were left when the work was stopped, missing the second floor and the roof.\n[[File:Genova Torre Granarolo.jpg|Granarolo tower|thumb|250px]]\n\n===New Walls today===\nThe new walls and forts, once the purposes for which they were planned were gone, were decommissioned from military property in 1914. After this date, some of thes structures were used as warehouses, jails for prisoners of war during   [[World War I]], anti-aircraft emplacements, or houses for [[Emergency evacuation|evacuee]]s during  [[World War II]]. Others were given to private ownership or left abandoned. \nNowadays, although they are public property, their condition is not uniform: the main fortresses have recently been restored and may be visited on request, others, even if in a state of decay, are freely visited, and some of them host television or cellphone towers.\n\nThe only fort still used by a military institution is Fort San Giuliano, which overlooks Corso Italia, in the quarter of [[Albaro]], now headquarters of the Provincial Command of the [[Carabinieri]].\n\nThe \"New Walls\" and the forts are now included in the \"Parco Urbano delle Mura\" (City Park of Walls), having a surface of 876 hectares, which is the largest green \"lung\" of Genoa, and provides the possibility of different excursions of historic and wildlife interest.<ref>http://www.turismo.comune.genova.it/spip.php?article298</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{commons category|Walls of Genoa}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Stefano Finauri, ''Forti di Genova: storia, tecnica e architettura dei fortini difensivi'', Edizioni Servizi Editoriali, Genoa 2007, {{ISBN|978-88-89384-27-5}}\n* Riccardo Dellepiane, ''Mura e fortificazioni di Genova'', Nuova Editrice Genovese, Genoa 1984 (reprinted in 2008, {{ISBN|978-88-88963-22-8}})\n* Piera Melli, ''La citt\u00e0 ritrovata.
