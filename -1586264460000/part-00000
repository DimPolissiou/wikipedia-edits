J. Caruso]], written by [[Christopher B. Landon|Christopher Landon]] and [[Carl Ellsworth]] and stars [[Shia LaBeouf]], [[David Morse (actor)|David Morse]], [[Sarah Roemer]] and [[Carrie-Anne Moss]]. The film follows a teenager who is placed on house arrest for assault and begins to spy on his neighbors, believing one of them is a possible [[serial killer]].\n\nPartially inspired by [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Rear Window]]'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bventertainment.go.com/tv/buenavista/ebertandroeper/index2.html?sec=6&subsec=disturbia |title=Disturbia reviewed on ''Ebert & Roeper'' |author=Richard Roeper |author2=A.O.

It has an approval rating of 69% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] and grossed $117.8 million against a budget of $20 million.\n\n==Plot==\nTroubled by the death of his father in an auto accident, Kale Brecht attacks his [[Spanish language|Spanish]] teacher when the teacher invokes his father while reprimanding him. For the assault, he is sentenced by a sympathetic judge to three months under [[house arrest]] with an [[ankle monitor]] and a [[proximity sensor]]. Detective Parker explains the system to Kale and his mother Julie. Initially, the teen just plays video games and watches television, but he is soon grounded by Julie and loses his access to the [[iTunes Music Store]], [[Xbox Live]], and his [[television]].\n\nKale's boredom leads him to watch the neighborhood, including the two neighbor boys who play pranks on him, his next-door neighbor Robert Turner, and Ashley Carlson, the new girl in town. One night, Kale becomes suspicious of Turner, who returns home in a 1960s [[Ford Mustang]] with a dented fender that matches the description given on a news report of a serial killer at large. Kale's best friend Ronnie visits to spy on Ashley and, when they accidentally alert her to their hijinks, the curious girl joins them in spying on Turner. Kale observes a young woman Turner had picked up from a nightclub as she flees the house in a panic but later appears to leave in her car.\n\nAshley throws a party and teases Kale, knowing he is watching. He plays non-party music loudly to needle her, and Ashley comes over to stop it. But the two flirt and start to make out, distracting each other while blood splatters on Turner's windows. Later, as Kale and Ashley watch, Turner drags a heavy bag to his garage. Kale gets Ashley to follow Turner, but he confronts her in her car with a calm, but threatening manner. Meanwhile, Ronnie successfully breaks into Turner's garage with a camera but gets trapped when the garage door closes. Kale leaves to rescue him but alerts the police upon leaving his property with the ankle monitor. The police come and search the garage but show Kale the bag contains a roadkill deer. Julie then goes across the street to talk to Turner to ask him not to press charges, while Ronnie reveals that he has escaped from Turner's house.\n\nWhen Kale watches the tape when Ronnie made it into Turner's house, he notices a corpse in plastic in a vent. Next door, Turner takes Julie captive and enters Kale's house, knocking out Ronnie and binding and gagging Kale. The killer reveals his plan to frame Kale for the murders of Ronnie and Julie and make it appear Kale then killed himself. When Ashley arrives, interrupting the plan, Kale attacks Turner, throwing him from the top of the stairs before Ashley frees him from his bindings; they jump out of the window into the pool when Turner resurfaces. Kale's ankle monitor again alerts the police, and he enters Turner's home to search for his mother. In a hidden room, Kale finds ample evidence of Turner's previous murders. The officer who monitors Kale arrives at the scene but Turner breaks his neck, killing him. Kale stumbles upon the decaying remains of murder victims and finds his mother bound and gagged. Turner appears, slashes Kale in the back and pins him to a wall, but before Turner can kill Kale, Julie stabs him in the leg with a dagger, allowing Kale to grab a pair of gardening shears and impale Turner in the chest with them, killing him.\n\nIn the aftermath, Kale is shown having his ankle bracelet removed by the authorities for good behavior and getting back at the two boys from earlier pranks. He then passionately kisses Ashley on his sofa, while Ronnie is playfully video taping them.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- poster billing -->\n*[[Shia LaBeouf]] as Kale Brecht, a 17-year-old high school student who is under house arrest and begins to suspect that his neighbor is a serial killer.\n*[[David Morse]] as Robert Turner, Kale's neighbor who the three teens suspect of being a serial killer. \n*[[Sarah Roemer]] as Ashley Carlson, Kale's neighbor and love interest who assists in Kale's mission to get to the truth.\n*[[Carrie-Anne Moss]] as Julie Brecht, Kale's mother who begins to develop a more authoritative attitude towards him.\n*[[Aaron Yoo]] as Ronnie Chu, Kale's best friend who helps him spy on the neighbors.\n*[[Viola Davis]] as Detective Parker, the detective in charge of Kale's case.\n*[[Jose Pablo Cantillo]] as Officer Gutierrez, Se\u00f1or Gutierrez's cousin who is in charge of Kale\u2019s case and likes to torment him.\n* [[Matt Craven]] as Daniel Brecht, Kale's father.\n* Luciano Rauso and Brandon and Daniel Caruso as the Greenwood boys.\n* [[Kevin Quinn (actor)|Kevin Quinn]] as Mr. Carlson.\n* Elyse Mirto as Mrs. Carlson.\n* Suzanne Rico and [[Kent Shocknek]] as news anchors.\n* Rene Rivera as Se\u00f1or Gutierrez, Kale's Spanish teacher whom he assaults, resulting in Kale\u2019s house arrest.\n* [[Amanda Walsh]] as Minnie Tyco.\n* Charles Carroll as Judge.\n* Gillian Shure as Turner's Club Girl.\n* Dominic Daniel as Policeman.\n* Lisa Robin as Big Wheel Mom.\n* Cindy Lou Adkins as Mrs. Greenwood.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nThe script was written in the 1990s and was optioned. The original studio let the option expire after hearing about [[Christopher Reeve]]'s remake of ''Rear Window''. It was not until 2004 that the script was rewritten and sold.\n\nExecutive producer [[Steven Spielberg]] arranged for LaBeouf to be on the casting shortlist for this film because he was impressed by LaBeouf's work on ''[[Holes (film)|Holes]]''. Caruso auditioned over a hundred males for the role in five weeks before settling on LaBeouf as he was looking for someone \"who guys would really like and respond to, because he wasn't going to be such a pretty boy\". LaBeouf was attracted to the role because of the director's 2002 film ''[[The Salton Sea (2002 film)|The Salton Sea]]'', which he complimented as one of his favorite films. Before filming started, the two watched the thriller films ''[[Rear Window]]'' starring [[James Stewart]], ''[[Straw Dogs (1971 film)|Straw Dogs]]'' starring [[Dustin Hoffman]], and ''[[The Conversation]]'' starring [[Gene Hackman]]. They also viewed the 1989 [[romantic film]] ''[[Say Anything...]]'' and \"mixed all the movies together.\"<ref name=\"Biggie\">{{cite web|title=Interview with Shia LaBeouf\u2013 Disturbia|url=http://www.biggie.co.nz/article/shia_la_beouf|work=Biggie|accessdate=November 22, 2013|year=2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202223415/http://www.biggie.co.nz/article/shia_la_beouf|archivedate=December 2, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> LaBeouf says he spoke to people on house arrest and locked himself in a room with the bracelet to feel what the confinement of house arrest is like.<ref name=\"Biggie\" /> He commented in an interview, \"...it's hard.

Kale's best friend Ronnie visits to spy on Ashley and, when they accidentally alert her to their hijinks, the curious girl joins them in spying on Turner. Kale observes a young woman Turner had picked up from a nightclub as she flees the house in a panic but later appears to leave in her car.\n\nAshley throws a party and teases Kale, knowing he is watching. He plays non-party music loudly to needle her, and Ashley comes over to stop it. But the two flirt and start to make out, distracting each other while blood splatters on Turner's windows. Later, as Kale and Ashley watch, Turner drags a heavy bag to his garage. Kale gets Ashley to follow Turner, but he confronts her in her car with a calm, but threatening manner. Meanwhile, Ronnie successfully breaks into Turner's garage with a camera but gets trapped when the garage door closes. Kale leaves to rescue him but alerts the police upon leaving his property with the ankle monitor. The police come and search the garage but show Kale the bag contains a roadkill deer. Julie then goes across the street to talk to Turner to ask him not to press charges, while Ronnie reveals that he has escaped from Turner's house.\n\nWhen Kale watches the tape when Ronnie made it into Turner's house, he notices a corpse in plastic in a vent. Next door, Turner takes Julie captive and enters Kale's house, knocking out Ronnie and binding and gagging Kale. The killer reveals his plan to frame Kale for the murders of Ronnie and Julie and make it appear Kale then killed himself. When Ashley arrives, interrupting the plan, Kale attacks Turner, throwing him from the top of the stairs before Ashley frees him from his bindings; they jump out of the window into the pool when Turner resurfaces. Kale's ankle monitor again alerts the police, and he enters Turner's home to search for his mother. In a hidden room, Kale finds ample evidence of Turner's previous murders. The officer who monitors Kale arrives at the scene but Turner breaks his neck, killing him. Kale stumbles upon the decaying remains of murder victims and finds his mother bound and gagged. Turner appears, slashes Kale in the back and pins him to a wall, but before Turner can kill Kale, Julie stabs him in the leg with a dagger, allowing Kale to grab a pair of gardening shears and impale Turner in the chest with them, killing him.\n\nIn the aftermath, Kale is shown having his ankle bracelet removed by the authorities for good behavior and getting back at the two boys from earlier pranks. He then passionately kisses Ashley on his sofa, while Ronnie is playfully video taping them.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- poster billing -->\n*[[Shia LaBeouf]] as Kale Brecht, a 17-year-old high school student who is under house arrest and begins to suspect that his neighbor is a serial killer.\n*[[David Morse]] as Robert Turner, Kale's neighbor who the three teens suspect of being a serial killer. \n*[[Sarah Roemer]] as Ashley Carlson, Kale's neighbor and love interest who assists in Kale's mission to get to the truth.\n*[[Carrie-Anne Moss]] as Julie Brecht, Kale's mother who begins to develop a more authoritative attitude towards him.\n*[[Aaron Yoo]] as Ronnie Chu, Kale's best friend who helps him spy on the neighbors.\n*[[Viola Davis]] as Detective Parker, the detective in charge of Kale's case.\n*[[Jose Pablo Cantillo]] as Officer Gutierrez, Se\u00f1or Gutierrez's cousin who is in charge of Kale\u2019s case and likes to torment him.\n* [[Matt Craven]] as Daniel Brecht, Kale's father.\n* Luciano Rauso and Brandon and Daniel Caruso as the Greenwood boys.\n* [[Kevin Quinn (actor)|Kevin Quinn]] as Mr. Carlson.\n* Elyse Mirto as Mrs. Carlson.\n* Suzanne Rico and [[Kent Shocknek]] as news anchors.\n* Rene Rivera as Se\u00f1or Gutierrez, Kale's Spanish teacher whom he assaults, resulting in Kale\u2019s house arrest.\n* [[Amanda Walsh]] as Minnie Tyco.\n* Charles Carroll as Judge.\n* Gillian Shure as Turner's Club Girl.\n* Dominic Daniel as Policeman.\n* Lisa Robin as Big Wheel Mom.\n* Cindy Lou Adkins as Mrs. Greenwood.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nThe script was written in the 1990s and was optioned. The original studio let the option expire after hearing about [[Christopher Reeve]]'s remake of ''Rear Window''. It was not until 2004 that the script was rewritten and sold.\n\nExecutive producer [[Steven Spielberg]] arranged for LaBeouf to be on the casting shortlist for this film because he was impressed by LaBeouf's work on ''[[Holes (film)|Holes]]''. Caruso auditioned over a hundred males for the role in five weeks before settling on LaBeouf as he was looking for someone \"who guys would really like and respond to, because he wasn't going to be such a pretty boy\". LaBeouf was attracted to the role because of the director's 2002 film ''[[The Salton Sea (2002 film)|The Salton Sea]]'', which he complimented as one of his favorite films. Before filming started, the two watched the thriller films ''[[Rear Window]]'' starring [[James Stewart]], ''[[Straw Dogs (1971 film)|Straw Dogs]]'' starring [[Dustin Hoffman]], and ''[[The Conversation]]'' starring [[Gene Hackman]]. They also viewed the 1989 [[romantic film]] ''[[Say Anything...]]'' and \"mixed all the movies together.\"<ref name=\"Biggie\">{{cite web|title=Interview with Shia LaBeouf\u2013 Disturbia|url=http://www.biggie.co.nz/article/shia_la_beouf|work=Biggie|accessdate=November 22, 2013|year=2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202223415/http://www.biggie.co.nz/article/shia_la_beouf|archivedate=December 2, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> LaBeouf says he spoke to people on house arrest and locked himself in a room with the bracelet to feel what the confinement of house arrest is like.<ref name=\"Biggie\" /> He commented in an interview, \"...it's hard.

The Sons of Pitch, GW's only male a cappella group, has been around since 2003, and the female group the GW Pitches was founded in 1996. All the groups are extremely committed to charity work, with the Troubadours holding an annual philanthropic concert in the fall entitled \"Acappellapalooza,\" and the Sons of Pitch holding one in the spring named \"The United States of A-Cappella.\" In the case of the former, groups from GWU are drawn for a concert, in the latter, groups from around the nation. The groups have raised tens of thousands of dollars for various charitable causes. Additionally, the university is home to the Voice gospel choir, a group that sings gospel music, the GW Vibes, a co-ed group focusing on soulful music. The GW Sirens, another all-girls group, and the GW Motherfunkers, a coed top 40 group, were created in 2003 and 2012, respectively.

The Sons of Pitch, GW's only male a cappella group, has been around since 2003, and the female group the GW Pitches was founded in 1996. All the groups are extremely committed to charity work, with the Troubadours holding an annual philanthropic concert in the fall entitled \"Acappellapalooza,\" and the Sons of Pitch holding one in the spring named \"The United States of A-Cappella.\" In the case of the former, groups from GWU are drawn for a concert, in the latter, groups from around the nation. The groups have raised tens of thousands of dollars for various charitable causes. Additionally, the university is home to the Voice gospel choir, a group that sings gospel music, the GW Vibes, a co-ed group focusing on soulful music. The GW Sirens, another all-girls group, and the GW Motherfunkers, a coed top 40 group, were created in 2003 and 2012, respectively.

''New York'' won back-to-back ASME Cover of the Year awards in 2012 and 2013, for \"Is She Just Too Old for This?\" and \"The City and the Storm\" respectively.  Design director Chris Dixon and photography director Jody Quon were named \"Design Team of the Year\" by [[Adweek]] in 2008.\n\nIn 2009, after [[Bruce Wasserstein]]'s death, the magazine's ownership passed to his family. Many obituaries noted Wasserstein's revival of the magazine. \"While previous owners had required constant features in the magazine about the best place to get a croissant or a beret,\" wrote [[David Carr (journalist)|David Carr]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'', \"it was clear that Wasserstein wanted a publication that was the best place to learn about the complicated apparatus that is modern New York.

For the first year of the magazine's existence, the composer and lyricist [[Stephen Sondheim]] contributed an extremely complex [[cryptic crossword]] to every third issue. In the style of British crosswords (as they are sometimes called), the cryptic crosswords feature clues that include a straight definition and a wordplay definition. [[Richard Maltby, Jr.]] took over thereafter. Since 1980, the magazine has also run an American-style crossword. For the first 30 years the puzzle was always by [[Maura Jacobson]], but beginning in the summer of 2010, Cathy Allis Millhauser's byline began appearing in alternate weeks, and the magazine announced her as permanent co-constructor in September 2010. Jacobson retired in April 2011, having created 1,400 puzzles for the magazine, including 30 years when she wrote a puzzle every single week without missing an issue.<ref>Staff. [http://nymag.com/nymag/letters/maura-jacobson-retiring-2011-5/ \"An Appreciation: Thirty-one Down; After three decades\u2013plus of puzzle-making, Maura B.

Accessed January 1, 2018. \"Maura had been working for Cue for two and a half years, and in the issue of May 19, 1980, her byline first appeared on our back page. In three decades (until she dropped back to alternating weeks a year ago), she has never skipped an issue, not once.\"</ref> The cryptic crosswords were eventually dropped.\n\nIn the remaining two weeks out of every three, Sondheim's friend Mary Ann Madden edited<ref>''Cat People'', Bill Hayward, introduction by Rogers E. M. Whitaker. New York: Dolphin/Doubleday, 1978 (p. 52)</ref> an extremely popular witty literary competition calling for readers to send in humorous poetry or other bits of wordplay on a theme that changed with each installment. (A typical entry, in a competition calling for humorous epitaphs, supplied this one for Geronimo: \"Requiescat in Apache.\") Altogether, Madden ran 973 installments of the competition, retiring in 2000. Hundreds, sometimes thousands, of entries were received each week, and winners included [[David Mamet]], [[Herb Sargent]], and [[Dan Greenburg]]. [[David Halberstam]] once claimed that he had submitted entries 137 times without winning. Sondheim, [[Woody Allen]], and [[Nora Ephron]] were fans.\n\nThe Competition's demise, when Madden retired, was greatly lamented among its fans. In August 2000, the magazine published a letter from an Irish contestant, John O'Byrne, who wrote: \"How I'll miss the fractured definitions, awful puns, conversation stoppers, one-letter misprints, ludicrous proverbs, openings of bad novels, near misses, et al. (what a nice guy Al is!).\" Many entrants have since migrated to ''[[The Washington Post]]''{{'}}s similar \"[[The Style Invitational|Style Invitational]]\" feature.  Three volumes of Competition winners were published, titled ''Thank You for the Giant Sea Tortoise'', ''Son of Giant Sea Tortoise'', and ''Maybe He's Dead: And Other Hilarious Results of New York Magazine Competitions''.\n\n==Digital expansion and destination sites==\nIn 2006, ''New York''{{'}}s website, nymag.com, underwent a year-long relaunch, transforming the site from a magazine companion to an up-to-the-minute news and service destination.

For the first year of the magazine's existence, the composer and lyricist [[Stephen Sondheim]] contributed an extremely complex [[cryptic crossword]] to every third issue. In the style of British crosswords (as they are sometimes called), the cryptic crosswords feature clues that include a straight definition and a wordplay definition. [[Richard Maltby, Jr.]] took over thereafter. Since 1980, the magazine has also run an American-style crossword. For the first 30 years the puzzle was always by [[Maura Jacobson]], but beginning in the summer of 2010, Cathy Allis Millhauser's byline began appearing in alternate weeks, and the magazine announced her as permanent co-constructor in September 2010. Jacobson retired in April 2011, having created 1,400 puzzles for the magazine, including 30 years when she wrote a puzzle every single week without missing an issue.<ref>Staff. [http://nymag.com/nymag/letters/maura-jacobson-retiring-2011-5/ \"An Appreciation: Thirty-one Down; After three decades\u2013plus of puzzle-making, Maura B. Jacobson is retiring.\"], ''New York'', April 24, 2011. Accessed January 1, 2018. \"Maura had been working for Cue for two and a half years, and in the issue of May 19, 1980, her byline first appeared on our back page. In three decades (until she dropped back to alternating weeks a year ago), she has never skipped an issue, not once.\"</ref> The cryptic crosswords were eventually dropped.\n\nIn the remaining two weeks out of every three, Sondheim's friend Mary Ann Madden edited<ref>''Cat People'', Bill Hayward, introduction by Rogers E. M. Whitaker. New York: Dolphin/Doubleday, 1978 (p. 52)</ref> an extremely popular witty literary competition calling for readers to send in humorous poetry or other bits of wordplay on a theme that changed with each installment. (A typical entry, in a competition calling for humorous epitaphs, supplied this one for Geronimo: \"Requiescat in Apache.\") Altogether, Madden ran 973 installments of the competition, retiring in 2000. Hundreds, sometimes thousands, of entries were received each week, and winners included [[David Mamet]], [[Herb Sargent]], and [[Dan Greenburg]]. [[David Halberstam]] once claimed that he had submitted entries 137 times without winning. Sondheim, [[Woody Allen]], and [[Nora Ephron]] were fans.\n\nThe Competition's demise, when Madden retired, was greatly lamented among its fans. In August 2000, the magazine published a letter from an Irish contestant, John O'Byrne, who wrote: \"How I'll miss the fractured definitions, awful puns, conversation stoppers, one-letter misprints, ludicrous proverbs, openings of bad novels, near misses, et al. (what a nice guy Al is!).\" Many entrants have since migrated to ''[[The Washington Post]]''{{'}}s similar \"[[The Style Invitational|Style Invitational]]\" feature.  Three volumes of Competition winners were published, titled ''Thank You for the Giant Sea Tortoise'', ''Son of Giant Sea Tortoise'', and ''Maybe He's Dead: And Other Hilarious Results of New York Magazine Competitions''.\n\n==Digital expansion and destination sites==\nIn 2006, ''New York''{{'}}s website, nymag.com, underwent a year-long relaunch, transforming the site from a magazine companion to an up-to-the-minute news and service destination.

This may include [[data structures]] like [[String (computer science)|strings]], [[List (abstract data type)|lists]], and [[hash table]]s that are either built-in or result from combining variables using [[Pointer (computer programming)|memory pointers]].\n* Procedures \u2013 also known as functions, methods, routines, or [[subroutine]]s \u2013 that take input, generate output, and manipulate data.  Modern languages include [[structured programming]] constructs like [[Loop (computing)|loops]] and [[Conditional (computer programming)|conditionals]].\n\n[[Modular programming]] support provides the ability to group procedures into files and modules for organizational purposes.  Modules are [[namespace]]d so identifiers in one module will not conflict with a procedure or variable sharing the same name in another file or module.\n\n===Objects and classes===\nLanguages that support object-oriented programming (OOP) typically use [[Inheritance (object-oriented programming)|inheritance]] for code reuse and extensibility in the form of either [[Class-based programming|classes]] or [[Prototype-based programming|prototypes]]. Those that use classes support two main concepts:\n* [[Class (computer science)|Classes]] \u2013 the definitions for the data format and available procedures for a given type or class of object; may also contain data and procedures (known as class methods) themselves, i.e. classes contain the data members and member functions\n* [[Object (computer science)|Objects]] \u2013 instances of classes\n\nObjects sometimes correspond to things found in the real world. For example, a graphics program may have objects such as \"circle\", \"square\", \"menu\". An online shopping system might have objects such as \"shopping cart\", \"customer\", and \"product\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Booch|first=Grady|title=Software Engineering with Ada|year=1986|publisher=Addison Wesley|isbn=978-0805306088|page=220|url=https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Grady_Booch|quote=Perhaps the greatest strength of an object-oriented approach to development is that it offers a mechanism that captures a model of the real world.}}</ref> Sometimes objects represent more abstract entities, like an object that represents an open file, or an object that provides the service of translating measurements from U.S. customary to metric.\n\n{{Quote box\n |quote  = Object-oriented programming is more than just classes and objects; it's a whole programming paradigm based around [''sic''] ''objects'' (data structures) that contain data fields and methods.

Procedures in object-oriented programming are known as [[Method (computer science)|methods]]; variables are also known as [[Field (computer science)|fields]], members, attributes, or properties.  This leads to the following terms:\n* [[Class variable]]s \u2013 belong to the ''class as a whole''; there is only one copy of each one\n* [[Instance variable]]s or attributes \u2013 data that belongs to individual ''objects''; every object has its own copy of each one\n* [[Member variable]]s \u2013 refers to both the class and instance variables that are defined by a particular class\n* Class methods \u2013 belong to the ''class as a whole'' and have access only to class variables and inputs from the procedure call\n* Instance methods \u2013 belong to ''individual objects'', and have access to instance variables for the specific object they are called on, inputs, and class variables\n\nObjects are accessed somewhat like variables with complex internal structure, and in many languages are effectively [[Pointer (computer programming)|pointers]], serving as actual references to a single instance of said object in memory within a heap or stack.  They provide a layer of [[Abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]] which can be used to separate internal from external code. External code can use an object by calling a specific instance method with a certain set of input parameters, read an instance variable, or write to an instance variable. Objects are created by calling a special type of method in the class known as a [[Constructor (object-oriented programming)|constructor]].  A program may create many instances of the same class as it runs, which operate independently.  This is an easy way for the same procedures to be used on different sets of data.\n\nObject-oriented programming that uses classes is sometimes called [[class-based programming]], while [[prototype-based programming]] does not typically use classes. As a result, a significantly different yet analogous terminology is used to define the concepts of ''object'' and ''instance''.\n\nIn some languages classes and objects can be composed using other concepts like [[Trait (computer programming)|traits]] and [[mixin]]s.\n\n===Class-based vs prototype-based===\nIn [[Class-based programming|class-based languages]] the ''classes'' are defined beforehand and the ''objects'' are instantiated based on the classes. If two objects ''apple'' and ''orange'' are instantiated from the class ''Fruit'', they are inherently fruits and it is guaranteed that you may handle them in the same way; e.g. a programmer can expect the existence of the same attributes such as ''color'' or ''sugar_content'' or ''is_ripe''.\n\nIn [[Prototype-based programming|prototype-based languages]] the ''objects'' are the primary entities. No ''classes'' even exist. The ''prototype'' of an object is just another object to which the object is linked. Every object has one ''prototype'' link (and only one).  New objects can be created based on already existing objects chosen as their prototype. You may call two different objects ''apple'' and ''orange'' a fruit, if the object ''fruit'' exists, and both ''apple'' and ''orange'' have ''fruit'' as their prototype. The idea of the ''fruit'' class doesn't exist explicitly, but as the [[equivalence class]] of the objects sharing the same prototype. The attributes and methods of the ''prototype'' are [[Delegation (computing)|delegated]] to all the objects of the equivalence class defined by this prototype. The attributes and methods ''owned'' individually by the object may not be shared by other objects of the same equivalence class; e.g. the attribute ''sugar_content'' may be unexpectedly not present in ''apple''. Only [[single inheritance]] can be implemented through the prototype.\n\n===Dynamic dispatch/message passing===\nIt is the responsibility of the object, not any external code, to select the procedural code to execute in response to a method call, typically by looking up the method at run time in a table associated with the object.  This feature is known as [[dynamic dispatch]], and distinguishes an object from an [[abstract data type]] (or module), which has a fixed (static) implementation of the operations for all instances.  If the call variability relies on more than the single type of the object on which it is called (i.e. at least one other parameter object is involved in the method choice), one speaks of [[multiple dispatch]].\n\nA method call is also known as ''[[message passing]]''.  It is conceptualized as a message (the name of the method and its input parameters) being passed to the object for dispatch.\n\n===Encapsulation===\nEncapsulation is an object-oriented programming concept that binds together the data and functions that manipulate the data, and that keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse. Data encapsulation led to the important OOP concept of [[Information hiding|data hiding]].\n\nIf a class does not allow calling code to access internal object data and permits access through methods only, this is a strong form of abstraction or information hiding known as [[Encapsulation (object-oriented programming)|encapsulation]].  Some languages (Java, for example) let classes enforce access restrictions explicitly, for example denoting internal data with the <code>private</code> keyword and designating methods intended for use by code outside the class with the <code>public</code> keyword.  Methods may also be designed public, private, or intermediate levels such as <code>protected</code> (which allows access from the same class and its subclasses, but not objects of a different class).  In other languages (like Python) this is enforced only by convention (for example, <code>private</code> methods may have names that start with an [[underscore]]).  Encapsulation prevents external code from being concerned with the internal workings of an object.  This facilitates [[code refactoring]], for example allowing the author of the class to change how objects of that class represent their data internally without changing any external code (as long as \"public\" method calls work the same way).  It also encourages programmers to put all the code that is concerned with a certain set of data in the same class, which organizes it for easy comprehension by other programmers.  Encapsulation is a technique that encourages [[Coupling (computer programming)|decoupling]].\n\n===Composition, inheritance, and delegation===\nObjects can contain other objects in their instance variables; this is known as [[object composition]].  For example, an object in the Employee class might contain (either directly or through a pointer) an object in the Address class, in addition to its own instance variables like \"first_name\" and \"position\".  Object composition is used to represent \"has-a\" relationships: every employee has an address, so every Employee object has access to a place to store an Address object (either directly embedded within itself, or at a separate location addressed via a pointer).\n\nLanguages that support classes almost always support [[inheritance (object-oriented programming)|inheritance]].  This allows classes to be arranged in a hierarchy that represents \"is-a-type-of\" relationships.  For example, class Employee might inherit from class Person.  All the data and methods available to the parent class also appear in the child class with the same names.  For example, class Person might define variables \"first_name\" and \"last_name\" with method \"make_full_name()\".  These will also be available in class Employee, which might add the variables \"position\" and \"salary\".  This technique allows easy re-use of the same procedures and data definitions, in addition to potentially mirroring real-world relationships in an intuitive way. Rather than utilizing database tables and programming subroutines, the developer utilizes objects the user may be more familiar with: objects from their application domain.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jacobsen|first=Ivar|title=Object Oriented Software Engineering|year=1992|publisher=Addison-Wesley ACM Press|isbn=978-0-201-54435-0|pages=[https://archive.org/details/objectorientedso00jaco/page/43 43\u201369]|author2=Magnus Christerson|author3=Patrik Jonsson|author4=Gunnar Overgaard|url=https://archive.org/details/objectorientedso00jaco/page/43}}</ref>\n\nSubclasses can override the methods defined by superclasses. [[Multiple inheritance]] is allowed in some languages, though this can make resolving overrides complicated.  Some languages have special support for [[mixin]]s, though in any language with multiple inheritance, a mixin is simply a class that does not represent an is-a-type-of relationship.  Mixins are typically used to add the same methods to multiple classes.  For example, class UnicodeConversionMixin might provide a method unicode_to_ascii() when included in class FileReader and class WebPageScraper, which don't share a common parent.\n\n[[Abstract class]]es cannot be instantiated into objects; they exist only for the purpose of inheritance into other \"concrete\" classes which can be instantiated.  In Java, the <code>[[final (Java)|final]]</code> keyword can be used to prevent a class from being subclassed.\n\nThe doctrine of [[composition over inheritance]] advocates implementing has-a relationships using composition instead of inheritance.  For example, instead of inheriting from class Person, class Employee could give each Employee object an internal Person object, which it then has the opportunity to hide from external code even if class Person has many public attributes or methods.  Some languages, like [[Go (programming language)|Go]] do not support inheritance at all.\n\nThe \"[[open/closed principle]]\" advocates that classes and functions \"should be open for extension, but closed for modification\".\n\n[[Delegation (programming)|Delegation]] is another language feature that can be used as an alternative to inheritance.\n\n===Polymorphism===\n[[Subtyping]] \u2013 a form of [[polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]] \u2013 is when calling code can be agnostic as to which class in the supported hierarchy it is operating on \u2013 the parent class or one of its descendants.  Meanwhile, the same operation name among objects in an inheritance hierarchy may behave differently.\n\nFor example, objects of type Circle and Square are derived from a common class called Shape.  The Draw function for each type of Shape implements what is necessary to draw itself while calling code can remain indifferent to the particular type of Shape being drawn.\n\nThis is another type of abstraction which simplifies code external to the class hierarchy and enables strong [[separation of concerns]].\n\n===Open recursion===\nIn languages that support [[open recursion]], object methods can call other methods on the same object (including themselves), typically using a special variable or keyword called <code>this</code> or <code>self</code>.  This variable is ''[[name binding|late-bound]]''; it allows a method defined in one class to invoke another method that is defined later, in some subclass thereof.\n\n==History==\n[[File:oop-uml-class-example.png|frame|right|[[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] notation for a class. This Button class has [[Variable (computer science)|variables]] for data, and [[Method (computer programming)|functions]]. Through inheritance a subclass can be created as subset of the Button class. Objects are instances of a class.]]\n\nTerminology invoking \"objects\" and \"oriented\" in the modern sense of object-oriented programming made its first appearance at [[MIT]] in the late 1950s and early 1960s.

[[Ole-Johan Dahl]] formally joined the project and the Simula programming language was designed to run on the [[UNIVAC I|Universal Automatic Computer]] (UNIVAC) 1107. In the early stages Simula was supposed to be a procedure package for the programming language [[ALGOL]] 60.  Dissatisfied with the restrictions imposed by ALGOL the researchers decided to develop Simula into a fully-fledged programming language, which used the UNIVAC ALGOL 60 compiler. Simula launched in 1964, and was promoted by Dahl and Nygaard throughout 1965 and 1966, leading to increasing use of the programming language in Sweden, Germany and the [[Soviet Union]]. In 1968, the language became widely available through the [[Burroughs large systems|Burroughs B5500 computers]], and was later also implemented on the [[Ural (computer)|URAL-16 computer]]. In 1966, Dahl and Nygaard wrote a Simula [[compiler]]. They became preoccupied with putting into practice [[Tony Hoare]]'s record class concept, which had been implemented in the free-form, English-like general-purpose simulation language [[SIMSCRIPT]]. They settled for a generalised process concept with record class properties, and a second layer of prefixes. Through prefixing a process could reference its predecessor and have additional properties. Simula thus introduced the class and subclass hierarchy, and the possibility of generating objects from these classes. The Simula 1 compiler and a new version of the programming language, Simula 67, was introduced to the wider world through the research paper \"Class and Subclass Declarations\" at a 1967 conference.<ref>{{Cite journal|last = Holmevik  |first = Jan Rune|title = Compiling Simula: A historical study of technological genesis|journal = IEEE Annals of the History of Computing|volume = 16  |issue = 4 |pages = 25\u201337 |year = 1994|url = http://www.idi.ntnu.no/grupper/su/publ/simula/holmevik-simula-ieeeannals94.pdf| doi =   10.1109/85.329756|accessdate =3 March 2018 }}</ref>\n\nA Simula 67 compiler was launched for the [[IBM System/360|System/360]] and [[IBM System/370|System/370]] [[IBM mainframe|IBM mainframe computers]] in 1972.

By 1974, the Association of Simula Users had members in 23 different countries. Early 1975 a Simula 67 compiler was released free of charge for the [[DECsystem-10]] mainframe family. By August the same year the DECsystem-10 Simula 67 compiler had been installed at 28 sites, 22 of them in North America. The object-oriented Simula programming language was used mainly by researchers involved with [[physical modelling]], such as models to study and improve the movement of ships and their content through cargo ports.<ref>{{Cite journal|last = Holmevik  |first = Jan Rune|title = Compiling Simula: A historical study of technological genesis|journal = IEEE Annals of the History of Computing|volume = 16  |issue = 4 |pages = 25\u201337 |year = 1994|url = http://www.idi.ntnu.no/grupper/su/publ/simula/holmevik-simula-ieeeannals94.pdf| doi =   10.1109/85.329756|accessdate =3 March 2018 }}</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s, the first version of the [[Smalltalk]] programming language was developed at [[Xerox PARC]] by [[Alan Kay]], [[Dan Ingalls]] and [[Adele Goldberg (computer scientist)|Adele Goldberg]].

Experimentation with various extensions to Lisp (such as LOOPS and [[Flavors (programming language)|Flavors]] introducing [[multiple inheritance]] and [[mixins]]) eventually led to the [[Common Lisp Object System]], which integrates functional programming and object-oriented programming and allows extension via a [[Meta-object protocol]]. In the 1980s, there were a few attempts to design processor architectures that included hardware support for objects in memory but these were not successful. Examples include the [[Intel iAPX 432]] and the [[Linn Products|Linn Smart]] [[Rekursiv]].\n\nIn 1981, Goldberg edited the August 1981 issue of [[Byte Magazine]], introducing Smalltalk and object-oriented programming to a wider audience. In 1986, the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] organised the first ''Conference on Object-Oriented Programming, Systems, Languages, and Applications'' (OOPSLA), which was unexpectedly attended by 1,000 people. In the mid-1980s [[Objective-C]] was developed by [[Brad Cox]], who had used Smalltalk at [[ITT Inc.]], and [[Bjarne Stroustrup]], who had used Simula for his PhD thesis, eventually went to create the object-oriented [[C++]].<ref name=\"Bertrand Meyer 2009 329\"/> In 1985, [[Bertrand Meyer]] also produced the first design of the [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel language]]. Focused on software quality, Eiffel is a purely object-oriented programming language and a notation supporting the entire software lifecycle. Meyer described the Eiffel software development method, based on a small number of key ideas from software engineering and computer science, in [[Object-Oriented Software Construction]]. Essential to the quality focus of Eiffel is Meyer's reliability mechanism, [[Design by Contract]], which is an integral part of both the method and language.\n\n[[File:Tiobeindex.png|thumb|350px|The [[TIOBE index|TIOBE]] [[Measuring programming language popularity|programming language popularity index]] graph from 2002 to 2018.

These included Visual [[FoxPro]] 3.0,<ref>1995 (June) Visual [[FoxPro]] 3.0, FoxPro evolves from a procedural language to an object-oriented language.

Its dominance was further enhanced by the rising popularity of [[graphical user interface]]s, which rely heavily upon object-oriented programming techniques. An example of a closely related dynamic GUI library and OOP language can be found in the [[Cocoa (software)|Cocoa]] frameworks on [[Mac OS X]], written in [[Objective-C]], an object-oriented, dynamic messaging extension to C based on Smalltalk. OOP toolkits also enhanced the popularity of [[event-driven programming]] (although this concept is not limited to OOP).\n\nAt [[ETH Z\u00fcrich]], [[Niklaus Wirth]] and his colleagues had also been investigating such topics as [[data abstraction]] and [[modularity (programming)|modular programming]] (although this had been in common use in the 1960s or earlier). [[Modula-2]] (1978) included both, and their succeeding design, [[Oberon (programming language)|Oberon]], included a distinctive approach to object orientation, classes, and such.\n\nObject-oriented features have been added to many previously existing languages, including [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], [[BASIC]], [[Fortran]], [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], and [[COBOL]]. Adding these features to languages that were not initially designed for them often led to problems with compatibility and maintainability of code.\n\nMore recently, a number of languages have emerged that are primarily object-oriented, but that are also compatible with procedural methodology. Two such languages are [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and [[Ruby programming language|Ruby]]. Probably the most commercially important recent object-oriented languages are [[Java (programming language)|Java]], developed by [[Sun Microsystems]], as well as [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] and [[Visual Basic.NET]] (VB.NET), both designed for Microsoft's [[.NET Framework|.NET]] platform. Each of these two frameworks shows, in its own way, the benefit of using OOP by creating an abstraction from implementation. VB.NET and C# support cross-language inheritance, allowing classes defined in one language to subclass classes defined in the other language.\n\n==OOP languages==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2009}}\n{{See also|List of object-oriented programming languages}}\n\n[[Simula]] (1967) is generally accepted as being the first language with the primary features of an object-oriented language. It was created for making [[Computer simulation|simulation programs]], in which what came to be called objects were the most important information representation. [[Smalltalk]] (1972 to 1980) is another early example, and the one with which much of the theory of OOP was developed. Concerning the degree of object orientation, the following distinctions can be made:\n<!-- Order lists of examples based on [[TIOBE index]]-->\n* Languages called \"pure\" OO languages, because everything in them is treated consistently as an object, from primitives such as characters and punctuation, all the way up to whole classes, prototypes, blocks, modules, etc. They were designed specifically to facilitate, even enforce, OO methods. Examples: [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]], [[Smalltalk]], [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel]], [[Emerald (programming language)|Emerald]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emeraldprogramminglanguage.org/|title=The Emerald Programming Language| date=26 February 2011}}</ref> [[JADE (programming language)|JADE]], [[Self (programming language)|Self]].\n* Languages designed mainly for OO programming, but with some procedural elements. Examples: [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[C++]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[Object Pascal|Delphi/Object Pascal]], [[VB.NET]].\n* Languages that are historically [[Procedural programming|procedural languages]], but have been extended with some OO features. Examples: [[PHP]], [[Perl]], [[Visual Basic]] (derived from BASIC), [[MATLAB]], [[COBOL 2002]], [[Fortran 2003]], [[ABAP]], [[Ada (programming language)|Ada 95]], [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]].\n* Languages with most of the features of objects (classes, methods, inheritance), but in a distinctly original form. Examples: [[Oberon (programming language)|Oberon]] (Oberon-1 or Oberon-2).\n* Languages with [[abstract data type]] support which may be used to resemble OO programming, but without all features of object-orientation. This includes [[object-based|object-''based'']] and [[Prototype-based programming|prototype-based]] languages. Examples: [[JavaScript]], [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]], [[Modula-2]], [[CLU (programming language)|CLU]].\n* Chameleon languages that support multiple paradigms, including OO. [[Tcl]] stands out among these for TclOO, a hybrid object system that supports both [[prototype-based programming]] and class-based OO.\n\n===OOP in dynamic languages===\nIn recent years, object-oriented programming has become especially popular in [[dynamic programming language]]s. [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Windows PowerShell|PowerShell]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] and [[Groovy (programming language)|Groovy]] are dynamic languages built on OOP principles, while [[Perl]] and [[PHP]] have been adding object-oriented features since Perl 5 and PHP 4, and [[ColdFusion]] since version 6.\n\nThe [[Document Object Model]] of [[HTML]], [[XHTML]], and [[XML]] documents on the Internet has bindings to the popular [[JavaScript]]/[[ECMAScript]] language. JavaScript is perhaps the best known [[prototype-based programming]] language, which employs cloning from prototypes rather than inheriting from a class (contrast to [[class-based programming]]). Another scripting language that takes this approach is [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]].\n\n===OOP in a network protocol===\nThe messages that flow between computers to request services in a client-server environment can be designed as the linearizations of objects defined by class objects known to both the client and the server.  For example, a simple linearized object would consist of a length field, a code point identifying the class, and a data value.  A more complex example would be a command consisting of the length and code point of the command and values consisting of linearized objects representing the command's parameters.  Each such command must be directed by the server to an object whose class (or superclass) recognizes the command and is able to provide the requested service. Clients and servers are best modeled as complex object-oriented structures. [[Distributed Data Management Architecture]] (DDM) took this approach and used class objects to define objects at four levels of a formal hierarchy:\n* Fields defining the data values that form messages, such as their length, code point and data values.\n* Objects and collections of objects similar to what would be found in a [[Smalltalk]] program for messages and parameters.\n* Managers similar to [[AS/400 object]]s, such as a directory to files and files consisting of metadata and records. Managers conceptually provide memory and processing resources for their contained objects.\n* A client or server consisting of all the managers necessary to implement a full processing environment, supporting such aspects as directory services, security and concurrency control.\n\nThe initial version of DDM defined distributed file services.  It was later extended to be the foundation of [[DRDA|Distributed Relational Database Architecture]] (DRDA).\n\n==Design patterns==\nChallenges of object-oriented design are addressed by several approaches. Most common is known as the [[Design Patterns (book)|design patterns codified by Gamma ''et al.'']]. More broadly, the term \"[[design pattern (computer science)|design patterns]]\" can be used to refer to any general, repeatable, solution pattern to a commonly occurring problem in software design. Some of these commonly occurring problems have implications and solutions particular to object-oriented development.\n\n===Inheritance and behavioral subtyping===\n{{See also|Object-oriented design}}<!-- not \"further\" because that article is mostly blather and does not even mention this -->\nIt is intuitive to assume that inheritance creates a [[program semantics|semantic]] \"[[is a]]\" relationship, and thus to infer that objects instantiated from subclasses can always be ''safely'' used instead of those instantiated from the superclass. This intuition is unfortunately false in most OOP languages, in particular in all those that allow [[mutable]] objects. [[Subtype polymorphism]] as enforced by the [[type checker]] in OOP languages (with mutable objects) cannot guarantee [[behavioral subtyping]] in any context. Behavioral subtyping is undecidable in general, so it cannot be implemented by a program (compiler). Class or object hierarchies must be carefully designed, considering possible incorrect uses that cannot be detected syntactically. This issue is known as the [[Liskov substitution principle]].\n\n===Gang of Four design patterns===\n{{Main|Design pattern (computer science)}}\n''[[Design Patterns (book)|Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software]]'' is an influential book published in 1994 by [[Erich Gamma]], [[Richard Helm]], [[Ralph Johnson (computer scientist)|Ralph Johnson]], and [[John Vlissides]], often referred to humorously as the \"Gang of Four\". Along with exploring the capabilities and pitfalls of object-oriented programming, it describes 23 common programming problems and patterns for solving them.\nAs of April 2007, the book was in its 36th printing.\n\nThe book describes the following patterns:\n* ''[[Creational pattern]]s'' (5): [[Factory method pattern]], [[Abstract factory pattern]], [[Singleton pattern]], [[Builder pattern]], [[Prototype pattern]]\n* ''[[Structural pattern]]s'' (7): [[Adapter pattern]], [[Bridge pattern]], [[Composite pattern]], [[Decorator pattern]], [[Facade pattern]], [[Flyweight pattern]], [[Proxy pattern]]\n* ''[[Behavioral pattern]]s'' (11): [[Chain-of-responsibility pattern]], [[Command pattern]], [[Interpreter pattern]], [[Iterator pattern]], [[Mediator pattern]], [[Memento pattern]], [[Observer pattern]], [[State pattern]], [[Strategy pattern]], [[Template method pattern]], [[Visitor pattern]]\n\n===Object-orientation and databases===\n{{Main|Object-relational impedance mismatch|Object-relational mapping|Object database}}\nBoth object-oriented programming and [[relational database management systems]] (RDBMSs) are extremely common in software {{As of|2006|alt=today}}. Since [[relational database]]s don't store objects directly (though some RDBMSs have object-oriented features to approximate this), there is a general need to bridge the two worlds. The problem of bridging object-oriented programming accesses and data patterns with relational databases is known as [[object-relational impedance mismatch]]. There are a number of approaches to cope with this problem, but no general solution without downsides.<ref name=\"RDMDBobjectmis\">{{Cite web| first = Ted| last = Neward| title = The Vietnam of Computer Science| date = 26 June 2006| accessdate = 2 June 2010| publisher = Interoperability Happens| url = http://blogs.tedneward.com/2006/06/26/The+Vietnam+Of+Computer+Science.aspx| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060704030226/http://blogs.tedneward.com/2006/06/26/The+Vietnam+Of+Computer+Science.aspx| archive-date = 4 July 2006| url-status = dead| df = dmy-all}}</ref> One of the most common approaches is [[object-relational mapping]], as found in [[Integrated development environment|IDE]] languages such as [[Visual FoxPro]] and libraries such as [[Java Data Objects]] and [[Ruby on Rails]]' ActiveRecord.\n\nThere are also [[object database]]s that can be used to replace RDBMSs, but these have not been as technically and commercially successful as RDBMSs.\n\n===Real-world modeling and relationships===\nOOP can be used to associate real-world objects and processes with digital counterparts.

The following concepts and constructs have been used as interpretations of OOP concepts:\n* [[F-Coalgebra|co algebraic data types]]<ref name=poll97>{{cite web|last=Poll|first=Erik|title=Subtyping and Inheritance for Categorical Datatypes|url=http://www.cs.ru.nl/E.Poll/papers/kyoto97.pdf|accessdate=5 June 2011}}</ref>\n* [[abstract data type]]s (which have [[existential types]]) allow the definition of [[module (programming)|modules]] but these do not support [[dynamic dispatch]]\n* [[recursive type]]s\n* encapsulated state\n* [[Inheritance (object-oriented programming)|inheritance]]\n* [[Record (computer science)|records]] are basis for understanding objects if [[function literal]]s can be stored in fields (like in functional-programming languages), but the actual calculi need be considerably more complex to incorporate essential features of OOP.

A feature of objects is an object's procedures that can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated (objects have a notion of \"[[this (computer programming)|this]]\" or \"self\").

This may include [[data structures]] like [[String (computer science)|strings]], [[List (abstract data type)|lists]], and [[hash table]]s that are either built-in or result from combining variables using [[Pointer (computer programming)|memory pointers]].\n* Procedures \u2013 also known as functions, methods, routines, or [[subroutine]]s \u2013 that take input, generate output, and manipulate data.  Modern languages include [[structured programming]] constructs like [[Loop (computing)|loops]] and [[Conditional (computer programming)|conditionals]].\n\n[[Modular programming]] support provides the ability to group procedures into files and modules for organizational purposes.  Modules are [[namespace]]d so identifiers in one module will not conflict with a procedure or variable sharing the same name in another file or module.\n\n===Objects and classes===\nLanguages that support object-oriented programming (OOP) typically use [[Inheritance (object-oriented programming)|inheritance]] for code reuse and extensibility in the form of either [[Class-based programming|classes]] or [[Prototype-based programming|prototypes]]. Those that use classes support two main concepts:\n* [[Class (computer science)|Classes]] \u2013 the definitions for the data format and available procedures for a given type or class of object; may also contain data and procedures (known as class methods) themselves, i.e. classes contain the data members and member functions\n* [[Object (computer science)|Objects]] \u2013 instances of classes\n\nObjects sometimes correspond to things found in the real world. For example, a graphics program may have objects such as \"circle\", \"square\", \"menu\". An online shopping system might have objects such as \"shopping cart\", \"customer\", and \"product\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Booch|first=Grady|title=Software Engineering with Ada|year=1986|publisher=Addison Wesley|isbn=978-0805306088|page=220|url=https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Grady_Booch|quote=Perhaps the greatest strength of an object-oriented approach to development is that it offers a mechanism that captures a model of the real world.}}</ref> Sometimes objects represent more abstract entities, like an object that represents an open file, or an object that provides the service of translating measurements from U.S. customary to metric.\n\n{{Quote box\n |quote  = Object-oriented programming is more than just classes and objects; it's a whole programming paradigm based around [''sic''] ''objects'' (data structures) that contain data fields and methods.

Procedures in object-oriented programming are known as [[Method (computer science)|methods]]; variables are also known as [[Field (computer science)|fields]], members, attributes, or properties.  This leads to the following terms:\n* [[Class variable]]s \u2013 belong to the ''class as a whole''; there is only one copy of each one\n* [[Instance variable]]s or attributes \u2013 data that belongs to individual ''objects''; every object has its own copy of each one\n* [[Member variable]]s \u2013 refers to both the class and instance variables that are defined by a particular class\n* Class methods \u2013 belong to the ''class as a whole'' and have access only to class variables and inputs from the procedure call\n* Instance methods \u2013 belong to ''individual objects'', and have access to instance variables for the specific object they are called on, inputs, and class variables\n\nObjects are accessed somewhat like variables with complex internal structure, and in many languages are effectively [[Pointer (computer programming)|pointers]], serving as actual references to a single instance of said object in memory within a heap or stack.  They provide a layer of [[Abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]] which can be used to separate internal from external code. External code can use an object by calling a specific instance method with a certain set of input parameters, read an instance variable, or write to an instance variable. Objects are created by calling a special type of method in the class known as a [[Constructor (object-oriented programming)|constructor]].  A program may create many instances of the same class as it runs, which operate independently.  This is an easy way for the same procedures to be used on different sets of data.\n\nObject-oriented programming that uses classes is sometimes called [[class-based programming]], while [[prototype-based programming]] does not typically use classes. As a result, a significantly different yet analogous terminology is used to define the concepts of ''object'' and ''instance''.\n\nIn some languages classes and objects can be composed using other concepts like [[Trait (computer programming)|traits]] and [[mixin]]s.\n\n===Class-based vs prototype-based===\nIn [[Class-based programming|class-based languages]] the ''classes'' are defined beforehand and the ''objects'' are instantiated based on the classes. If two objects ''apple'' and ''orange'' are instantiated from the class ''Fruit'', they are inherently fruits and it is guaranteed that you may handle them in the same way; e.g. a programmer can expect the existence of the same attributes such as ''color'' or ''sugar_content'' or ''is_ripe''.\n\nIn [[Prototype-based programming|prototype-based languages]] the ''objects'' are the primary entities. No ''classes'' even exist. The ''prototype'' of an object is just another object to which the object is linked. Every object has one ''prototype'' link (and only one).  New objects can be created based on already existing objects chosen as their prototype. You may call two different objects ''apple'' and ''orange'' a fruit, if the object ''fruit'' exists, and both ''apple'' and ''orange'' have ''fruit'' as their prototype. The idea of the ''fruit'' class doesn't exist explicitly, but as the [[equivalence class]] of the objects sharing the same prototype. The attributes and methods of the ''prototype'' are [[Delegation (computing)|delegated]] to all the objects of the equivalence class defined by this prototype. The attributes and methods ''owned'' individually by the object may not be shared by other objects of the same equivalence class; e.g. the attribute ''sugar_content'' may be unexpectedly not present in ''apple''. Only [[single inheritance]] can be implemented through the prototype.\n\n===Dynamic dispatch/message passing===\nIt is the responsibility of the object, not any external code, to select the procedural code to execute in response to a method call, typically by looking up the method at run time in a table associated with the object.  This feature is known as [[dynamic dispatch]], and distinguishes an object from an [[abstract data type]] (or module), which has a fixed (static) implementation of the operations for all instances.  If the call variability relies on more than the single type of the object on which it is called (i.e. at least one other parameter object is involved in the method choice), one speaks of [[multiple dispatch]].\n\nA method call is also known as ''[[message passing]]''.  It is conceptualized as a message (the name of the method and its input parameters) being passed to the object for dispatch.\n\n===Encapsulation===\nEncapsulation is an object-oriented programming concept that binds together the data and functions that manipulate the data, and that keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse. Data encapsulation led to the important OOP concept of [[Information hiding|data hiding]].\n\nIf a class does not allow calling code to access internal object data and permits access through methods only, this is a strong form of abstraction or information hiding known as [[Encapsulation (object-oriented programming)|encapsulation]].  Some languages (Java, for example) let classes enforce access restrictions explicitly, for example denoting internal data with the <code>private</code> keyword and designating methods intended for use by code outside the class with the <code>public</code> keyword.  Methods may also be designed public, private, or intermediate levels such as <code>protected</code> (which allows access from the same class and its subclasses, but not objects of a different class).  In other languages (like Python) this is enforced only by convention (for example, <code>private</code> methods may have names that start with an [[underscore]]).  Encapsulation prevents external code from being concerned with the internal workings of an object.  This facilitates [[code refactoring]], for example allowing the author of the class to change how objects of that class represent their data internally without changing any external code (as long as \"public\" method calls work the same way).  It also encourages programmers to put all the code that is concerned with a certain set of data in the same class, which organizes it for easy comprehension by other programmers.  Encapsulation is a technique that encourages [[Coupling (computer programming)|decoupling]].\n\n===Composition, inheritance, and delegation===\nObjects can contain other objects in their instance variables; this is known as [[object composition]].  For example, an object in the Employee class might contain (either directly or through a pointer) an object in the Address class, in addition to its own instance variables like \"first_name\" and \"position\".  Object composition is used to represent \"has-a\" relationships: every employee has an address, so every Employee object has access to a place to store an Address object (either directly embedded within itself, or at a separate location addressed via a pointer).\n\nLanguages that support classes almost always support [[inheritance (object-oriented programming)|inheritance]].  This allows classes to be arranged in a hierarchy that represents \"is-a-type-of\" relationships.  For example, class Employee might inherit from class Person.  All the data and methods available to the parent class also appear in the child class with the same names.  For example, class Person might define variables \"first_name\" and \"last_name\" with method \"make_full_name()\".  These will also be available in class Employee, which might add the variables \"position\" and \"salary\".  This technique allows easy re-use of the same procedures and data definitions, in addition to potentially mirroring real-world relationships in an intuitive way. Rather than utilizing database tables and programming subroutines, the developer utilizes objects the user may be more familiar with: objects from their application domain.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jacobsen|first=Ivar|title=Object Oriented Software Engineering|year=1992|publisher=Addison-Wesley ACM Press|isbn=978-0-201-54435-0|pages=[https://archive.org/details/objectorientedso00jaco/page/43 43\u201369]|author2=Magnus Christerson|author3=Patrik Jonsson|author4=Gunnar Overgaard|url=https://archive.org/details/objectorientedso00jaco/page/43}}</ref>\n\nSubclasses can override the methods defined by superclasses. [[Multiple inheritance]] is allowed in some languages, though this can make resolving overrides complicated.  Some languages have special support for [[mixin]]s, though in any language with multiple inheritance, a mixin is simply a class that does not represent an is-a-type-of relationship.  Mixins are typically used to add the same methods to multiple classes.  For example, class UnicodeConversionMixin might provide a method unicode_to_ascii() when included in class FileReader and class WebPageScraper, which don't share a common parent.\n\n[[Abstract class]]es cannot be instantiated into objects; they exist only for the purpose of inheritance into other \"concrete\" classes which can be instantiated.  In Java, the <code>[[final (Java)|final]]</code> keyword can be used to prevent a class from being subclassed.\n\nThe doctrine of [[composition over inheritance]] advocates implementing has-a relationships using composition instead of inheritance.  For example, instead of inheriting from class Person, class Employee could give each Employee object an internal Person object, which it then has the opportunity to hide from external code even if class Person has many public attributes or methods.  Some languages, like [[Go (programming language)|Go]] do not support inheritance at all.\n\nThe \"[[open/closed principle]]\" advocates that classes and functions \"should be open for extension, but closed for modification\".\n\n[[Delegation (programming)|Delegation]] is another language feature that can be used as an alternative to inheritance.\n\n===Polymorphism===\n[[Subtyping]] \u2013 a form of [[polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]] \u2013 is when calling code can be agnostic as to which class in the supported hierarchy it is operating on \u2013 the parent class or one of its descendants.  Meanwhile, the same operation name among objects in an inheritance hierarchy may behave differently.\n\nFor example, objects of type Circle and Square are derived from a common class called Shape.  The Draw function for each type of Shape implements what is necessary to draw itself while calling code can remain indifferent to the particular type of Shape is being drawn.\n\nThis is another type of abstraction which simplifies code external to the class hierarchy and enables strong [[separation of concerns]].\n\n===Open recursion===\nIn languages that support [[open recursion]], object methods can call other methods on the same object (including themselves), typically using a special variable or keyword called <code>this</code> or <code>self</code>.  This variable is ''[[name binding|late-bound]]''; it allows a method defined in one class to invoke another method that is defined later, in some subclass thereof.\n\n==History==\n[[File:oop-uml-class-example.png|frame|right|[[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] notation for a class. This Button class has [[Variable (computer science)|variables]] for data, and [[Method (computer programming)|functions]]. Through inheritance a subclass can be created as subset of the Button class. Objects are instances of a class.]]\n\nTerminology invoking \"objects\" and \"oriented\" in the modern sense of object-oriented programming made its first appearance at [[MIT]] in the late 1950s and early 1960s. In the environment of the [[artificial intelligence]] group, as early as 1960, \"object\" could refer to identified items ([[Lisp (programming language)|LISP]] atoms) with properties (attributes);<ref>{{Cite journal\n |last=McCarthy\n |first=J.\n |editor-link=John McCarthy\n |last2=Brayton\n |first2=R.\n |author2-link=Robert Brayton (computer scientist)\n |last3=Edwards\n |first3=D.\n |author3-link=Daniel Edwards (programmer)\n |last4=Fox\n |first4=P.\n |author4-link=Phyllis Fox\n |last5=Hodes\n |first5=L.\n |author5-link=Louis Hodes\n |last6=Luckham\n |first6=D.\n |author6-link=David Luckham\n |last7=Maling\n |first7=K.\n |author7-link=Klim Maling (programmer)\n |last8=Park\n |first8=D.\n |author8-link=David Park (computer scientist)\n |last9=Russell\n |first9=S.\n |author9-link=Steve Russell (computer scientist)\n |title=LISP I Programmers Manual\n |place=[[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]\n |publisher=Artificial Intelligence Group, [[M.I.T.

[[Ole-Johan Dahl]] formally joined the project and the Simula programming language was designed to run on the [[UNIVAC I|Universal Automatic Computer]] (UNIVAC) 1107. In the early stages Simula was supposed to be a procedure package for the programming language [[ALGOL]] 60.  Dissatisfied with the restrictions imposed by ALGOL the researchers decided to develop Simula into a fully-fledged programming language, which used the UNIVAC ALGOL 60 compiler. Simula launched in 1964, and was promoted by Dahl and Nygaard throughout 1965 and 1966, leading to increasing use of the programming language in Sweden, Germany and the [[Soviet Union]]. In 1968, the language became widely available through the [[Burroughs large systems|Burroughs B5500 computers]], and was later also implemented on the [[Ural (computer)|URAL-16 computer]]. In 1966, Dahl and Nygaard wrote a Simula [[compiler]]. They became preoccupied with putting into practice [[Tony Hoare]]'s record class concept, which had been implemented in the free-form, English-like general-purpose simulation language [[SIMSCRIPT]]. They settled for a generalised process concept with record class properties, and a second layer of prefixes. Through prefixing a process could reference its predecessor and have additional properties. Simula thus introduced the class and subclass hierarchy, and the possibility of generating objects from these classes. The Simula 1 compiler and a new version of the programming language, Simula 67, was introduced to the wider world through the research paper \"Class and Subclass Declarations\" at a 1967 conference.<ref>{{Cite journal|last = Holmevik  |first = Jan Rune|title = Compiling Simula: A historical study of technological genesis|journal = IEEE Annals of the History of Computing|volume = 16  |issue = 4 |pages = 25\u201337 |year = 1994|url = http://www.idi.ntnu.no/grupper/su/publ/simula/holmevik-simula-ieeeannals94.pdf| doi =   10.1109/85.329756|accessdate =3 March 2018 }}</ref>\n\nA Simula 67 compiler was launched for the [[IBM System/360|System/360]] and [[IBM System/370|System/370]] [[IBM mainframe|IBM mainframe computers]] in 1972. In the same year a Simula 67 compiler was launched free of charge for the French [[CII 10070]] and [[CII Iris]] 80 [[mainframe computers]]. By 1974, the Association of Simula Users had members in 23 different countries. Early 1975 a Simula 67 compiler was released free of charge for the [[DECsystem-10]] mainframe family. By August the same year the DECsystem-10 Simula 67 compiler had been installed at 28 sites, 22 of them in North America. The object-oriented Simula programming language was used mainly by researchers involved with [[physical modelling]], such as models to study and improve the movement of ships and their content through cargo ports.<ref>{{Cite journal|last = Holmevik  |first = Jan Rune|title = Compiling Simula: A historical study of technological genesis|journal = IEEE Annals of the History of Computing|volume = 16  |issue = 4 |pages = 25\u201337 |year = 1994|url = http://www.idi.ntnu.no/grupper/su/publ/simula/holmevik-simula-ieeeannals94.pdf| doi =   10.1109/85.329756|accessdate =3 March 2018 }}</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s, the first version of the [[Smalltalk]] programming language was developed at [[Xerox PARC]] by [[Alan Kay]], [[Dan Ingalls]] and [[Adele Goldberg (computer scientist)|Adele Goldberg]].

Experimentation with various extensions to Lisp (such as LOOPS and [[Flavors (programming language)|Flavors]] introducing [[multiple inheritance]] and [[mixins]]) eventually led to the [[Common Lisp Object System]], which integrates functional programming and object-oriented programming and allows extension via a [[Meta-object protocol]]. In the 1980s, there were a few attempts to design processor architectures that included hardware support for objects in memory but these were not successful. Examples include the [[Intel iAPX 432]] and the [[Linn Products|Linn Smart]] [[Rekursiv]].\n\nIn 1981, Goldberg edited the August 1981 issue of [[Byte Magazine]], introducing Smalltalk and object-oriented programming to a wider audience. In 1986, the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] organised the first ''Conference on Object-Oriented Programming, Systems, Languages, and Applications'' (OOPSLA), which was unexpectedly attended by 1,000 people. In the mid-1980s [[Objective-C]] was developed by [[Brad Cox]], who had used Smalltalk at [[ITT Inc.]], and [[Bjarne Stroustrup]], who had used Simula for his PhD thesis, eventually went to create the object-oriented [[C++]].<ref name=\"Bertrand Meyer 2009 329\"/> In 1985, [[Bertrand Meyer]] also produced the first design of the [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel language]]. Focused on software quality, Eiffel is a purely object-oriented programming language and a notation supporting the entire software lifecycle. Meyer described the Eiffel software development method, based on a small number of key ideas from software engineering and computer science, in [[Object-Oriented Software Construction]]. Essential to the quality focus of Eiffel is Meyer's reliability mechanism, [[Design by Contract]], which is an integral part of both the method and language.\n\n[[File:Tiobeindex.png|thumb|350px|The [[TIOBE index|TIOBE]] [[Measuring programming language popularity|programming language popularity index]] graph from 2002 to 2018.

These included Visual [[FoxPro]] 3.0,<ref>1995 (June) Visual [[FoxPro]] 3.0, FoxPro evolves from a procedural language to an object-oriented language. Visual FoxPro 3.0 introduces a database container, seamless client/server capabilities, support for ActiveX technologies, and OLE Automation and null support.

Its dominance was further enhanced by the rising popularity of [[graphical user interface]]s, which rely heavily upon object-oriented programming techniques. An example of a closely related dynamic GUI library and OOP language can be found in the [[Cocoa (software)|Cocoa]] frameworks on [[Mac OS X]], written in [[Objective-C]], an object-oriented, dynamic messaging extension to C based on Smalltalk. OOP toolkits also enhanced the popularity of [[event-driven programming]] (although this concept is not limited to OOP).\n\nAt [[ETH Z\u00fcrich]], [[Niklaus Wirth]] and his colleagues had also been investigating such topics as [[data abstraction]] and [[modularity (programming)|modular programming]] (although this had been in common use in the 1960s or earlier). [[Modula-2]] (1978) included both, and their succeeding design, [[Oberon (programming language)|Oberon]], included a distinctive approach to object orientation, classes, and such.\n\nObject-oriented features have been added to many previously existing languages, including [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], [[BASIC]], [[Fortran]], [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], and [[COBOL]]. Adding these features to languages that were not initially designed for them often led to problems with compatibility and maintainability of code.\n\nMore recently, a number of languages have emerged that are primarily object-oriented, but that are also compatible with procedural methodology. Two such languages are [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and [[Ruby programming language|Ruby]]. Probably the most commercially important recent object-oriented languages are [[Java (programming language)|Java]], developed by [[Sun Microsystems]], as well as [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] and [[Visual Basic.NET]] (VB.NET), both designed for Microsoft's [[.NET Framework|.NET]] platform. Each of these two frameworks shows, in its own way, the benefit of using OOP by creating an abstraction from implementation. VB.NET and C# support cross-language inheritance, allowing classes defined in one language to subclass classes defined in the other language.\n\n==OOP languages==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2009}}\n{{See also|List of object-oriented programming languages}}\n\n[[Simula]] (1967) is generally accepted as being the first language with the primary features of an object-oriented language. It was created for making [[Computer simulation|simulation programs]], in which what came to be called objects were the most important information representation. [[Smalltalk]] (1972 to 1980) is another early example, and the one with which much of the theory of OOP was developed. Concerning the degree of object orientation, the following distinctions can be made:\n<!-- Order lists of examples based on [[TIOBE index]]-->\n* Languages called \"pure\" OO languages, because everything in them is treated consistently as an object, from primitives such as characters and punctuation, all the way up to whole classes, prototypes, blocks, modules, etc. They were designed specifically to facilitate, even enforce, OO methods. Examples: [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]], [[Smalltalk]], [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel]], [[Emerald (programming language)|Emerald]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emeraldprogramminglanguage.org/|title=The Emerald Programming Language| date=26 February 2011}}</ref> [[JADE (programming language)|JADE]], [[Self (programming language)|Self]].\n* Languages designed mainly for OO programming, but with some procedural elements. Examples: [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[C++]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[Object Pascal|Delphi/Object Pascal]], [[VB.NET]].\n* Languages that are historically [[Procedural programming|procedural languages]], but have been extended with some OO features. Examples: [[PHP]], [[Perl]], [[Visual Basic]] (derived from BASIC), [[MATLAB]], [[COBOL 2002]], [[Fortran 2003]], [[ABAP]], [[Ada (programming language)|Ada 95]], [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]].\n* Languages with most of the features of objects (classes, methods, inheritance), but in a distinctly original form. Examples: [[Oberon (programming language)|Oberon]] (Oberon-1 or Oberon-2).\n* Languages with [[abstract data type]] support which may be used to resemble OO programming, but without all features of object-orientation. This includes [[object-based|object-''based'']] and [[Prototype-based programming|prototype-based]] languages. Examples: [[JavaScript]], [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]], [[Modula-2]], [[CLU (programming language)|CLU]].\n* Chameleon languages that support multiple paradigms, including OO. [[Tcl]] stands out among these for TclOO, a hybrid object system that supports both [[prototype-based programming]] and class-based OO.\n\n===OOP in dynamic languages===\nIn recent years, object-oriented programming has become especially popular in [[dynamic programming language]]s. [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Windows PowerShell|PowerShell]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] and [[Groovy (programming language)|Groovy]] are dynamic languages built on OOP principles, while [[Perl]] and [[PHP]] have been adding object-oriented features since Perl 5 and PHP 4, and [[ColdFusion]] since version 6.\n\nThe [[Document Object Model]] of [[HTML]], [[XHTML]], and [[XML]] documents on the Internet has bindings to the popular [[JavaScript]]/[[ECMAScript]] language. JavaScript is perhaps the best known [[prototype-based programming]] language, which employs cloning from prototypes rather than inheriting from a class (contrast to [[class-based programming]]). Another scripting language that takes this approach is [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]].\n\n===OOP in a network protocol===\nThe messages that flow between computers to request services in a client-server environment can be designed as the linearizations of objects defined by class objects known to both the client and the server.  For example, a simple linearized object would consist of a length field, a code point identifying the class, and a data value.  A more complex example would be a command consisting of the length and code point of the command and values consisting of linearized objects representing the command's parameters.  Each such command must be directed by the server to an object whose class (or superclass) recognizes the command and is able to provide the requested service. Clients and servers are best modeled as complex object-oriented structures. [[Distributed Data Management Architecture]] (DDM) took this approach and used class objects to define objects at four levels of a formal hierarchy:\n* Fields defining the data values that form messages, such as their length, code point and data values.\n* Objects and collections of objects similar to what would be found in a [[Smalltalk]] program for messages and parameters.\n* Managers similar to [[AS/400 object]]s, such as a directory to files and files consisting of metadata and records. Managers conceptually provide memory and processing resources for their contained objects.\n* A client or server consisting of all the managers necessary to implement a full processing environment, supporting such aspects as directory services, security and concurrency control.\n\nThe initial version of DDM defined distributed file services.  It was later extended to be the foundation of [[DRDA|Distributed Relational Database Architecture]] (DRDA).\n\n==Design patterns==\nChallenges of object-oriented design are addressed by several approaches. Most common is known as the [[Design Patterns (book)|design patterns codified by Gamma ''et al.'']]. More broadly, the term \"[[design pattern (computer science)|design patterns]]\" can be used to refer to any general, repeatable, solution pattern to a commonly occurring problem in software design. Some of these commonly occurring problems have implications and solutions particular to object-oriented development.\n\n===Inheritance and behavioral subtyping===\n{{See also|Object-oriented design}}<!-- not \"further\" because that article is mostly blather and does not even mention this -->\nIt is intuitive to assume that inheritance creates a [[program semantics|semantic]] \"[[is a]]\" relationship, and thus to infer that objects instantiated from subclasses can always be ''safely'' used instead of those instantiated from the superclass. This intuition is unfortunately false in most OOP languages, in particular in all those that allow [[mutable]] objects. [[Subtype polymorphism]] as enforced by the [[type checker]] in OOP languages (with mutable objects) cannot guarantee [[behavioral subtyping]] in any context. Behavioral subtyping is undecidable in general, so it cannot be implemented by a program (compiler). Class or object hierarchies must be carefully designed, considering possible incorrect uses that cannot be detected syntactically. This issue is known as the [[Liskov substitution principle]].\n\n===Gang of Four design patterns===\n{{Main|Design pattern (computer science)}}\n''[[Design Patterns (book)|Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software]]'' is an influential book published in 1994 by [[Erich Gamma]], [[Richard Helm]], [[Ralph Johnson (computer scientist)|Ralph Johnson]], and [[John Vlissides]], often referred to humorously as the \"Gang of Four\". Along with exploring the capabilities and pitfalls of object-oriented programming, it describes 23 common programming problems and patterns for solving them.\nAs of April 2007, the book was in its 36th printing.\n\nThe book describes the following patterns:\n* ''[[Creational pattern]]s'' (5): [[Factory method pattern]], [[Abstract factory pattern]], [[Singleton pattern]], [[Builder pattern]], [[Prototype pattern]]\n* ''[[Structural pattern]]s'' (7): [[Adapter pattern]], [[Bridge pattern]], [[Composite pattern]], [[Decorator pattern]], [[Facade pattern]], [[Flyweight pattern]], [[Proxy pattern]]\n* ''[[Behavioral pattern]]s'' (11): [[Chain-of-responsibility pattern]], [[Command pattern]], [[Interpreter pattern]], [[Iterator pattern]], [[Mediator pattern]], [[Memento pattern]], [[Observer pattern]], [[State pattern]], [[Strategy pattern]], [[Template method pattern]], [[Visitor pattern]]\n\n===Object-orientation and databases===\n{{Main|Object-relational impedance mismatch|Object-relational mapping|Object database}}\nBoth object-oriented programming and [[relational database management systems]] (RDBMSs) are extremely common in software {{As of|2006|alt=today}}. Since [[relational database]]s don't store objects directly (though some RDBMSs have object-oriented features to approximate this), there is a general need to bridge the two worlds. The problem of bridging object-oriented programming accesses and data patterns with relational databases is known as [[object-relational impedance mismatch]]. There are a number of approaches to cope with this problem, but no general solution without downsides.<ref name=\"RDMDBobjectmis\">{{Cite web| first = Ted| last = Neward| title = The Vietnam of Computer Science| date = 26 June 2006| accessdate = 2 June 2010| publisher = Interoperability Happens| url = http://blogs.tedneward.com/2006/06/26/The+Vietnam+Of+Computer+Science.aspx| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060704030226/http://blogs.tedneward.com/2006/06/26/The+Vietnam+Of+Computer+Science.aspx| archive-date = 4 July 2006| url-status = dead| df = dmy-all}}</ref> One of the most common approaches is [[object-relational mapping]], as found in [[Integrated development environment|IDE]] languages such as [[Visual FoxPro]] and libraries such as [[Java Data Objects]] and [[Ruby on Rails]]' ActiveRecord.\n\nThere are also [[object database]]s that can be used to replace RDBMSs, but these have not been as technically and commercially successful as RDBMSs.\n\n===Real-world modeling and relationships===\nOOP can be used to associate real-world objects and processes with digital counterparts. However, not everyone agrees that OOP facilitates direct real-world mapping (see [[object-oriented programming#Criticism|Criticism]] section) or that real-world mapping is even a worthy goal; [[Bertrand Meyer]] argues in ''[[Object-Oriented Software Construction]]''<ref name=\"Meyer230\">Meyer, Second Edition, p. 230</ref> that a program is not a model of the world but a model of some part of the world; \"Reality is a cousin twice removed\".

{"title_page": "Aristarchian symbols", "text_new": "Aristarchian symbols are editorial marks developed during the Hellenistic period and the early Roman empire for annotating then-ancient Greek texts \u2013 mainly the works of [[Homer]]. They were used to highlight missing text, text which was discrepant between sources, and text which appeared in the wrong place.\n\nTwo main types of ancient Greek philological annotations can be distinguished: Signs and explicit notes. Aristarchian symbols are signs.\n\n==Early development==\nThe first philological sign (\u03c3\u03b7\u03bc\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bf\u03bd) invented by [[Zenodotus|Zenodotos of Ephesos]], the first head of the [[Library of Alexandria|Alexandrinian Library]], in his edition of Homer has been the [[Obelus|''obelos'']] (\u1f40\u03b2\u03b5\u03bb\u03cc\u03c2), a short horizontal dash [-], which Zenodotos used to mark spurious lines. For this reason, the practice of using signs for textual criticism has been called '[[obelism]]'.\n\n[[Aristophanes of Byzantium]] invented later the ''[[asterisk]]'' (\u1f00\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2) [*] to mark lines that are duplicated from another place, as well as the [[Sigma#Lunate sigma|''lunate sigma'']] (\u03c3\u03af\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1) [\u03f9] and the [[Sigma#Lunate sigma|''antisigma'']] (\u1f00\u03bd\u03c4\u03af\u03c3\u03b9\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1) [\u03fd] for two consecutive and interchangeable lines of the same content.\n\nA system of dots also credited to Aristophanes of Byzantium was developed in the 3rd&nbsp;century&nbsp;BCE: A [[hypostigme|''low dot'']] [.] marked an occasion for a short breath after a short phrase, a [[stigme mese|''middot'']] (\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03b3\u03bc\u03ae) [\u00b7] marked an occasion for a longer breath after a longer passage, and a [[stigme teleia|''high dot'']] [\u02d9] marked a full stop at the end of a completed thought. Other writers employed [[two dot punctuation]] [\u205a] to mark the ends of sentences or changing speakers.

They were used to highlight missing text, text which was discrepant between sources, and text which appeared in the wrong place.\n\nTwo main types of ancient Greek philological annotations can be distinguished: Signs and explicit notes. Aristarchian symbols are signs.\n\n==Early development==\nThe first philological sign (\u03c3\u03b7\u03bc\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bf\u03bd) invented by [[Zenodotus|Zenodotos of Ephesos]], the first head of the [[Library of Alexandria|Alexandrinian Library]], in his edition of Homer has been the [[Obelus|''obelos'']] (\u1f40\u03b2\u03b5\u03bb\u03cc\u03c2), a short horizontal dash [-], which Zenodotos used to mark spurious lines. For this reason, the practice of using signs for textual criticism has been called '[[obelism]]'.\n\n[[Aristophanes of Byzantium]] invented later the ''[[asterisk]]'' (\u1f00\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2) [*] to mark lines that are duplicated from another place, as well as the [[Sigma#Lunate sigma|''lunate sigma'']] (\u03c3\u03af\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1) [\u03f9] and the [[Sigma#Lunate sigma|''antisigma'']] (\u1f00\u03bd\u03c4\u03af\u03c3\u03b9\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1) [\u03fd] for two consecutive and interchangeable lines of the same content.\n\nA system of dots also credited to Aristophanes of Byzantium was developed in the 3rd&nbsp;century&nbsp;BCE: A [[hypostigme|''low dot'']] [.] marked an occasion for a short breath after a short phrase, a [[stigme mese|''middot'']] (\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03b3\u03bc\u03ae) [\u00b7] marked an occasion for a longer breath after a longer passage, and a [[stigme teleia|''high dot'']] [\u02d9] marked a full stop at the end of a completed thought. Other writers employed [[two dot punctuation]] [\u205a] to mark the ends of sentences or changing speakers. Less often, arrangements of three [\u205d], four [\u205e] [\u2058], and five [\u2059] dots appeared.\n\n==System of Aristarchus==\nThe number of the philological signs and in some cases their meanings were modified by [[Aristarchus of Samothrace|Aristarchos of Samothrake]] (220\u2013143&nbsp;BCE), sixth head of the Alexandrinian Library. He used critical and exegetical signs in his editions of the Homeric poems.\n\nA ''dotted lunate sigma'' (\u03c3\u03af\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b5\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03b3\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd) [\u03fe] was used by him as an editorial sign indicating that the line so-marked is at an incorrect position in the surrounding text; an ''antisigma'', or reversed lunate sigma [\u03fd\u00a0], may also mark an out of place line.

Because the region separates the lower Adriatic coast from the [[Julian Alps]] range, extreme bora winds often occur there. They have influenced the region's traditional lifestyle and architecture. Towns on the coast, where the bora frequently occurs, are built densely with narrow streets in part because of the wind. Buildings in several towns and villages in [[Slovenia]] and the [[Province of Trieste]] ([[Italy]]) have stones on their roofs to prevent the tiles from being blown off. Chains and ropes are occasionally stretched along the sidewalks in downtown [[Trieste]], Italy, to facilitate pedestrian traffic &mdash; gusts in the city are usually above 120&nbsp;km/h reaching to maxima of near 200&nbsp;km/h. A strong bora will often be reported on Italian television news. Slovenian towns where the strongest bora occurs are [[Ajdov\u0161\u010dina]], [[Vipava, Slovenia|Vipava]] and, to a lesser extent, [[Nova Gorica]].

Because the region separates the lower Adriatic coast from the [[Julian Alps]] range, extreme bora winds often occur there. They have influenced the region's traditional lifestyle and architecture. Towns on the coast, where the bora frequently occurs, are built densely with narrow streets in part because of the wind. Buildings in several towns and villages in [[Slovenia]] and the [[Province of Trieste]] ([[Italy]]) have stones on their roofs to prevent the tiles from being blown off. Chains and ropes are occasionally stretched along the sidewalks in downtown [[Trieste]], Italy, to facilitate pedestrian traffic &mdash; gusts in the city are usually above 120&nbsp;km/h reaching to maxima of near 200&nbsp;km/h. A strong bora will often be reported on Italian television news. Slovenian towns where the strongest bora occurs are [[Ajdov\u0161\u010dina]], [[Vipava, Slovenia|Vipava]] and, to a lesser extent, [[Nova Gorica]]. In Slovenia, the most affected section is usually the upper part of the Vipava Valley, stretching from Ajdov\u0161\u010dina to [[Podnanos]], where the speed of the wind can exceed 200&nbsp;km/h.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zurnal24.si/za-ajdovci-mirna-noc-pred-njimi-vetroven-dan-clanek-147460|title=Ekipe so v stalni pripravljenosti|publisher=}}</ref>\n[[File:Novorossiysk, 1997.jpg|thumb|After bora catastrophe, [[Novorossiysk]] 1997]]\nStrong bora winds also occur in the [[Tsemes Bay]] of the [[Black Sea]] near the Russian port of [[Novorossiysk]], where they are known as nordost (\"northeastern\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vydrenkov.com/index.html|title=A book about bora|access-date=6 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141211025811/http://vydrenkov.com/index.html|archive-date=11 December 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> They can reach speeds of up to 220 kilometres per hour.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Dzungarian Gate]]\n* [[Oroshi]]\n* [[Santa Ana winds]]\n* [[Volkswagen Bora]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Hann, Julius.
