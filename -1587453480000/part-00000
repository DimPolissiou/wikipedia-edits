The [[Partition (politics)|partition]] involved the division of two provinces, [[Bengal]] and [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab]], based on district-wise non-Muslim or [[Muslim]] majorities. The partition also saw the division of the [[British Indian Army]], the [[Royal Indian Navy]], the [[Indian Civil Service]], the [[History of rail transport in India|railways]], and the central treasury. The partition was outlined in the [[Indian Independence Act 1947]] and resulted in the dissolution of the [[British Raj]], or [[Crown rule in India]]. The two self-governing countries of India and Pakistan legally came into existence at midnight on 15 August 1947.\n\nThe partition displaced between 10\u201312 million people along religious lines, creating overwhelming refugee crises in the newly constituted dominions. There was large-scale violence, with estimates of loss of life accompanying or preceding the partition disputed and varying between several hundred thousand and two million.{{sfn|Talbot|Singh|2009|p=2}}{{efn|\"The death toll remains disputed to this day with figures ranging from 200,000 to 2 million.\"{{sfn|Talbot|Singh|2009|p=2}}}} The violent nature of the partition created an atmosphere of hostility and suspicion between India and Pakistan that plagues [[Indo-Pakistani relations|their relationship]] to the present.\n\nThe term ''partition of India'' does not cover the [[Bangladesh Liberation War|secession of Bangladesh from Pakistan]] in 1971, nor the earlier separations of [[Burma]] (now [[Myanmar]]) and  [[Ceylon]] (now [[Sri Lanka]]) from the administration of British India.{{efn|Coastal Ceylon, part of the [[Madras Presidency]] of British India from 1796, became the separate [[crown colony]] of [[British Ceylon]] in 1802.

It does not cover the incorporation of the enclaves of [[French India]] into India during the period 1947\u20131954, nor the annexation of [[Goa]] and other districts of [[Portuguese India]] by India in 1961. Other contemporaneous political entities in the region in 1947, [[Sikkim]], [[Bhutan]], [[Nepal]], and [[the Maldives]] were unaffected by the partition.{{efn|The Himalayan kingdom of [[Sikkim]] was established as a [[princely state]] after the ''Anglo-Sikkimese Treaty'' of 1861.

It is believed that in the Sikh states (except for Jind and Kapurthala) the Maharajas were complacent in the ethnic cleansing of Muslims, while other Maharajas such as those of Patiala, Faridkot, and Bharatpur were heavily involved in ordering them.

The large Bengali Hindu middle-class (the ''[[Bhadralok]]''), upset at the prospect of Bengalis being outnumbered in the new Bengal province by Biharis and Oriyas, felt that Curzon's act was punishment for their political assertiveness.<ref name=\"spear176\" /> The pervasive protests against Curzon's decision took the form predominantly of the ''[[Swadeshi]]'' (\"buy Indian\") campaign and involved a boycott of British goods. Sporadically\u2014but flagrantly\u2014the protesters also took to political violence that involved attacks on civilians.<ref>{{harvnb|Spear|1990|p=176}}, {{harvnb|Stein|Arnold|2010|p=291}}, {{harvnb|Ludden|2002|p=193}}, {{harvnb|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|p=156}}</ref> The violence, however, was not effective, as most planned attacks were either pre-empted by the British or failed.<ref name=\"bandyo260\" /> The rallying cry for both types of protest was the slogan ''[[Bande Mataram]]'' ([[Bengali language|Bengali]], lit: \"Hail to the Mother\"), the title of a song by [[Bankim Chandra Chatterjee]], which invoked a mother goddess, who stood variously for Bengal, India, and the Hindu goddess [[Kali]].<ref name=\"ludden193\">{{harvnb|Ludden|2002|p=193}}</ref> The unrest spread from Calcutta to the surrounding regions of Bengal when Calcutta's English-educated students returned home to their villages and towns.<ref name=\"ludden199\">{{harvnb|Ludden|2002|p=199}}</ref> The religious stirrings of the slogan and the political outrage over the partition were combined as young men, in groups such as [[Jugantar]], took to bombing public buildings, staging armed robberies,<ref name=\"bandyo260\">{{harvnb|Bandyop\u0101dhy\u0101\u1e8fa|2004|p=260}}</ref> and assassinating British officials.<ref name=\"ludden193\" /> Since Calcutta was the imperial capital, both the outrage and the slogan soon became known nationally.<ref name=\"ludden193\" />\n\nThe overwhelming, but predominantly Hindu, protest against the partition of Bengal and the fear of reforms favouring the Hindu majority, now led the Muslim elite in India to meet with the new viceroy [[Lord Minto]] in 1906 and ask for separate electorates for Muslims. In conjunction, they demanded proportional legislative representation reflecting both their status as former rulers and their record of cooperating with the British. This led, in December 1906, to the founding of the [[All-India Muslim League]] in [[Dhaka|Dacca]]. Although Curzon by now had resigned his position over a dispute with his military chief [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] and returned to England, the League was in favor of his partition plan. The Muslim elite's position, which was reflected in the League's position, had crystallized gradually over the previous three decades, beginning with the 1871 Census of British India, which had first estimated the populations in regions of Muslim majority.<ref name=\"ludden200\">{{harvnb|Ludden|2002|p=200}}</ref> For his part, Curzon's desire to court the Muslims of East Bengal had arisen from British anxieties ever since the 1871 census, and in light of the history of Muslims fighting them in the [[Indian Mutiny of 1857|1857 Mutiny]] and the [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]].<ref name=\"ludden200\" /> In the three decades since that census, Muslim leaders across northern India, had intermittently experienced public animosity from some of the new Hindu political and social groups.<ref name=\"ludden200\" /> The [[Arya Samaj]], for example, had not only supported Cow Protection Societies in their agitation,<ref>{{harvnb|Stein|Arnold|2010|p=286}}</ref> but also\u2014distraught at the 1871 Census's Muslim numbers\u2014organized \"reconversion\" events for the purpose of welcoming Muslims back to the Hindu fold.<ref name=\"ludden200\" /> In the [[United Provinces of Agra and Oudh|United Provinces]], Muslims became anxious in the late 19th century Hindu political representation increased, and Hindus were politically mobilized in the [[Hindi-Urdu controversy]] and [[the anti-cow-killing riots]] of 1893.{{Sfn|Talbot|Singh|2009|p=20}} In 1905 Muslim fears increased when [[Lokmanya Tilak|Tilak]] and [[Lala Lajpat Rai|Lajpat Rai]] attempted to rise to leadership positions in the Congress, and the Congress itself rallied around the symbolism of Kali.<ref name=\"ludden200\" /> It was not lost on many Muslims, for example, that the rallying cry, \"Bande Mataram,\" had first appeared in the novel ''[[Anandmath]]'' in which Hindus had battled their Muslim oppressors.<ref name=\"ludden201\">{{harvnb|Ludden|2002|p=201}}</ref> Lastly, the Muslim elite, and among it [[Dhaka Nawab Family|Dacca Nawab]], [[Khwaja Salimullah]], who hosted the League's first meeting in his mansion in [[Shahbag]], was aware that a new province with a Muslim majority would directly benefit Muslims aspiring to political power.<ref name=\"ludden201\" />\n\n=== World War I, Lucknow Pact: 1914\u20131918 ===\n[[file:Indiantroops medical ww1.jpg|thumb|Indian medical orderlies attending to wounded soldiers with the ''Mesopotamian Expeditionary Force'' in [[Mesopotamia]] during [[World War I]]]]\n[[file:Gandhi back in india1915.gif|thumb|[[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]] (seated in the carriage, on the right, eyes downcast, with black flat-top hat) receives a big welcome in Karachi in 1916 after his return to India from South Africa]]\n[[file:Jinnah lucknow pact1916.jpg|thumb|[[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]], seated, third from the left, was a supporter of the Lucknow Pact, which, in 1916, ended the three-way rift between the Extremists, the Moderates and the League]]\n\n[[World War I]] would prove to be a watershed in the imperial relationship between Britain and India. 1.4 million Indian and British soldiers of the [[British Indian Army]] would take part in the war, and their participation would have a wider cultural fallout: news of Indian soldiers fighting and dying with British soldiers, as well as soldiers from [[dominion]]s like Canada and Australia, would travel to distant corners of the world both in newsprint and by the new medium of the radio.<ref name=\"brown-p197-198\">{{harvnb|Brown|1994|pp=197\u2013198}}</ref> India's international profile would thereby rise and would continue to rise during the 1920s.<ref name=\"brown-p197-198\" /> It was to lead, among other things, to India, under its name, becoming a [[League of Nations members#1920: founder members|founding member]] of the [[League of Nations]] in 1920 and participating, under the name, \"Les Indes Anglaises\" (British India), in the [[1920 Summer Olympics]] in Antwerp.<ref>[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1920/1920.pdf Olympic Games Antwerp 1920: Official Report], Nombre de bations representees, p. 168.

Since the [[Ottoman Caliphate|Turkish Sultan]], or ''Khalifah'', also had sporadically claimed guardianship of the Islamic holy sites of [[Mecca]], [[Medina]], and [[Jerusalem]], and since the British and their allies were now in conflict with Turkey, doubts began to increase among some Indian Muslims about the \"religious neutrality\" of the British, doubts that had already surfaced as a result of the [[Partition of Bengal (1905)|reunification of Bengal]] in 1911, a decision that was seen as ill-disposed to Muslims.<ref name=\"brown-p200-201\">{{Harvnb|Brown|1994|pp=200\u2013201}}</ref> In the [[Lucknow Pact]], the League joined the Congress in the proposal for greater self-government that was campaigned for by Tilak and his supporters; in return, the Congress accepted separate electorates for Muslims in the provincial legislatures as well as the Imperial Legislative Council. In 1916, the Muslim League had anywhere between 500 and 800 members and did not yet have its wider following among Indian Muslims of later years; in the League itself, the pact did not have unanimous backing, having largely been negotiated by a group of \"Young Party\" Muslims from the [[United Provinces of Agra and Oudh|United Provinces]] (UP), most prominently, the brothers [[Maulana Mohammad Ali|Mohammad]] and [[Maulana Shaukat Ali|Shaukat Ali]], who had embraced the Pan-Islamic cause.<ref name=\"brown-p200-201\" /> However, it did have the support of a young lawyer from Bombay, [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]], who was later to rise to leadership roles in both the League and the Indian independence movement. In later years, as the full ramifications of the pact unfolded, it was seen as benefiting the Muslim minority elites of provinces like UP and Bihar more than the Muslim majorities of Punjab and Bengal. At the time, the \"Lucknow Pact\" was an important milestone in nationalistic agitation and was seen so by the British.<ref name=\"brown-p200-201\" />\n\n===Montagu\u2013Chelmsford Reforms: 1919===\n[[Secretary of State for India]], [[Edwin Samuel Montagu|Montagu]] and [[Governor-General of India|Viceroy]] [[Frederic John Napier Thesiger, 3rd Baron Chelmsford|Lord Chelmsford]] presented a report in July 1918 after a long fact-finding trip through India the previous winter.<ref name=\"brown-p205-207\">{{Harvnb|Brown|1994|pp=205\u2013207}}</ref> After more discussion by the government and parliament in Britain, and another tour by the Franchise and Functions Committee to identify who among the Indian population could vote in future elections, the [[Government of India Act of 1919]] (also known as the [[Montagu\u2013Chelmsford Reforms]]) was passed in December 1919.<ref name=\"brown-p205-207\" /> The new Act enlarged both the provincial and [[Imperial Legislative Council|Imperial]] legislative councils and repealed the Government of India's recourse to the \"official majority\" in unfavourable votes.<ref name=\"brown-p205-207\" /> Although departments like defence, foreign affairs, criminal law, communications, and income-tax were retained by the [[Governor-General of India|Viceroy]] and the central government in New Delhi, other departments like public health, education, land-revenue, local self-government were transferred to the provinces.<ref name=\"brown-p205-207\" /> The provinces themselves were now to be administered under a new [[Diarchy|dyarchical]] system, whereby some areas like education, agriculture, infrastructure development, and local self-government became the preserve of Indian ministers and legislatures, and ultimately the Indian electorates, while others like irrigation, land-revenue, police, prisons, and control of media remained within the purview of the British governor and his executive council.<ref name=\"brown-p205-207\" /> The new Act also made it easier for Indians to be admitted into the civil service and the army officer corps.\n\nA greater number of Indians were now enfranchised, although, for voting at the national level, they constituted only 10% of the total adult male population, many of whom were still illiterate.<ref name=\"brown-p205-207\" /> In the provincial legislatures, the British continued to exercise some control by setting aside seats for special interests they considered cooperative or useful. In particular, rural candidates, generally sympathetic to British rule and less confrontational, were assigned more seats than their urban counterparts.<ref name=\"brown-p205-207\" /> Seats were also reserved for non-[[Brahmin]]s, landowners, businessmen, and college graduates. The principle of \"communal representation,\" an integral part of the [[Minto-Morley Reforms]], and more recently of the Congress-Muslim League Lucknow Pact, was reaffirmed, with seats being reserved for [[Muslims]], [[Sikhs]], [[Christianity in India|Indian Christians]], [[Anglo-Indians]], and domiciled Europeans, in both provincial and Imperial legislative councils.<ref name=\"brown-p205-207\" /> The Montagu-Chelmsford reforms offered Indians the most significant opportunity yet for exercising legislative power, especially at the provincial level; however, that opportunity was also restricted by the still limited number of eligible voters, by the small budgets available to provincial legislatures, and by the presence of rural and special interest seats that were seen as instruments of British control.<ref name=\"brown-p205-207\" />\n\n===Two-nation theory===\n{{main|Two-nation theory}}\nThe two-nation theory is the [[ideology]] that the primary identity and unifying denominator of [[Muslims]] in the [[Indian subcontinent]] is their religion, rather than their [[language]] or [[ethnicity]], and therefore Indian [[Hindus]] and Muslims are two distinct nations regardless of commonalities.<ref name=\"winks2001\">{{citation |last=Talbot |first=Ian |chapter=Pakistan's Emergence |editor1=Alaine M.

Looking ahead to the future, the Congress, especially its socialist wing headed by Nehru, wanted a central government that could direct and plan for an India, free of colonialism, that might eradicate its people's poverty and grow into an industrial power.

However, on the morning of the 16th, armed Muslim gangs gathered at the [[Ochterlony Monument]] in Calcutta to hear [[Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy]], the League's Chief Minister of Bengal, who, in the words of historian Yasmin Khan, \"if he did not explicitly incite violence certainly gave the crowd the impression that they could act with impunity, that neither the police nor the military would be called out and that the ministry would turn a blind eye to any action they unleashed in the city.\"{{Sfn|Khan|2007|pp=64\u201365}} That very evening, in Calcutta, Hindus were attacked by returning Muslim celebrants, who carried pamphlets distributed earlier which showed a clear connection between violence and the demand for Pakistan, and directly implicated the celebration of Direct Action Day with the outbreak of the cycle of violence that would later be called the \"Great Calcutta Killing of August 1946\".{{Sfn|Talbot|Singh|2009|p=69|ps=: Quote: \"Despite the Muslim League's denials, the outbreak was linked with the celebration of Direction Action Day.

Mountbatten hoped to revive the Cabinet Mission scheme for a federal arrangement for India.

British officials were unanimously pessimistic about Pakistan's state\u2019s future economic prospects. The agreement to an Indian Union contained in the Cabinet Mission proposals had been initially accepted by the Muslim League as the grouping proposals gave considerable autonomy in the Muslim majority areas. Moreover, there was the possibility of withdrawal and thus acquiring Pakistan by the back-door after a ten-year interval. The worsening communal situation and extensive soundings with Indian political figures convinced Mountbatten within a month of his arrival that partition was, however, the only way to secure a speedy and smooth transfer of power.|doi=10.2752/147800409X466254}}</ref>\n\n[[Vallabhbhai Patel]] was one of the first Congress leaders to accept the partition of India as a solution to the rising Muslim separatist movement led by [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]]. He had been outraged by Jinnah's Direct Action campaign, which had provoked communal violence across India and by the viceroy's vetoes of his home department's plans to stop the violence on the grounds of constitutionality. Patel severely criticized the viceroy's induction of League ministers into the government and the revalidation of the grouping scheme by the British without Congress approval. Although further outraged at the League's boycott of the assembly and non-acceptance of the plan of 16 May despite entering government, he was also aware that Jinnah enjoyed popular support amongst Muslims, and that an open conflict between him and the nationalists could degenerate into a Hindu-Muslim civil war. The continuation of a divided and weak central government would in Patel's mind, result in the wider fragmentation of India by encouraging more than 600 princely states towards independence.<ref>{{cite book|title=Patel: A Life|last=Gandhi|first=Rajmohan|pages=395\u2013397}}</ref> Between the months of December 1946 and January 1947, Patel worked with civil servant [[V. P. Menon]] on the latter's suggestion for a separate dominion of Pakistan created out of Muslim-majority provinces. Communal violence in Bengal and Punjab in January and March 1947 further convinced Patel of the soundness of partition. Patel, a fierce critic of Jinnah's demand that the Hindu-majority areas of Punjab and Bengal be included in a Muslim state, obtained the partition of those provinces, thus blocking any possibility of their inclusion in Pakistan. Patel's decisiveness on the partition of Punjab and Bengal had won him many supporters and admirers amongst the Indian public, which had been tired of the League's tactics. Still, he was criticized by Gandhi, Nehru, secular Muslims and socialists for a perceived eagerness for the partition. When Lord Mountbatten formally proposed [[the plan on 3 June 1947]], Patel gave his approval and lobbied Nehru and other Congress leaders to accept the proposal. Knowing Gandhi's deep anguish regarding proposals of partition, Patel engaged him in private meetings discussions over the perceived practical unworkability of any Congress-League coalition, the rising violence, and the threat of civil war. At the All India Congress Committee meeting called to vote on the proposal, Patel said:<blockquote>I fully appreciate the fears of our brothers from [the Muslim-majority areas]. Nobody likes the division of India, and my heart is heavy. But the choice is between one division and many divisions. We must face facts. We cannot give way to emotionalism and sentimentality. The Working Committee has not acted out of fear. But I am afraid of one thing, that all our toil and hard work of these many years might go waste or prove unfruitful. My nine months in office have completely disillusioned me regarding the supposed merits of the Cabinet Mission Plan. Except for a few honourable exceptions, Muslim officials from the top down to the chaprasis (peons or servants) are working for the League. The communal veto given to the League in the Mission Plan would have blocked India's progress at every stage. Whether we like it or not, de facto Pakistan already exists in the Punjab and Bengal. Under the circumstances, I would prefer a de jure Pakistan, which may make the League more responsible. Freedom is coming. We have 75 to 80 percent of India, which we can make strong with our genius. The League can develop the rest of the country.<ref>{{cite book|title=Transfer of Power in India|last=Menon|first=V.

Mittal Publications, 1987, p. 38.]</ref> and Congress' approval of the plan, Patel represented India on the Partition Council, where he oversaw the division of public assets and selected the Indian council of ministers with Nehru. However, neither he nor any other Indian leader had foreseen the intense violence and population transfer that would take place with partition. Late in 1946 the [[Attlee ministry|Labour government in Britain]], its exchequer exhausted by the recently concluded World War II, decided to end British rule of India, and in early 1947 Britain announced its intention of transferring power no later than June 1948. However, with the British army unprepared for the potential for increased violence, the new viceroy, [[Louis Mountbatten]], advanced the date for the transfer of power, allowing less than six months for a mutually agreed plan for independence. In June 1947, the nationalist leaders, including Nehru and [[Abul Kalam Azad]] on behalf of the Congress, Jinnah representing the Muslim League, [[B. R. Ambedkar]] representing the [[Dalit|Untouchable]] community, and [[Master Tara Singh]] representing the [[Sikhs]], agreed to a partition of the country along religious lines in stark opposition to Gandhi's views. The predominantly Hindu and Sikh areas were assigned to the new India and predominantly Muslim areas to the new nation of Pakistan; the plan included a partition of the Muslim-majority provinces of Punjab and Bengal. The communal violence that accompanied the announcement of the [[Radcliffe Line]], the line of partition, was even more horrific.\n\nDescribing the violence that accompanied the Partition of India, historians Ian Talbot and Gurharpal Singh write: <blockquote>There are numerous eyewitness accounts of the maiming and mutilation of victims. The catalogue of horrors includes the disembowelling of pregnant women, the slamming of babies' heads against brick walls, the cutting off of the victim's limbs and genitalia, and the displaying of heads and corpses. While previous communal riots had been deadly, the scale and level of brutality during the Partition massacres was unprecedented. Although some scholars question the use of the term '[[genocide]]' concerning the Partition massacres, much of the violence was manifested with genocidal tendencies. It was designed to cleanse an existing generation and prevent its future reproduction.\"{{Sfn|Talbot|Singh|2009|pp=67\u201368}}</blockquote>\n\nOn 14 August 1947, the new [[Dominion of Pakistan]] came into being, with Muhammad Ali Jinnah sworn in as its first Governor-General in [[Karachi]]. The following day, 15 August 1947, India, now a smaller ''Union of India'', became an independent country with official ceremonies taking place in New Delhi, and with Jawaharlal Nehru assuming the office of [[Prime Minister of India|prime minister]], and the viceroy Mountbatten staying on as its first [[Governor-General of India|Governor General]]. Gandhi remained in Bengal to work with the new refugees from the partitioned subcontinent.\n\n==Geographic partition, 1947==\n\n===Mountbatten Plan===\n[[File:Mountbatten 4 august 1947.jpg|thumb|upright|Mountbatten with a countdown calendar to the Transfer of Power in the background]]\nThe actual division of British India between the two new dominions was accomplished according to what has come to be known as the [[\"3 June Plan\" or \"Mountbatten Plan\"]]. It was announced at a press conference by Mountbatten on 3 June 1947, when the date of independence - 15 August 1947 - was also announced. The plan's main points were:\n* Sikhs, Hindus and Muslims in Punjab and Bengal legislative assemblies would meet and vote for partition. If a simple majority of either group wanted partition, then these provinces would be divided.\n* Sind and Baluchistan were to make their own decision.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Transfer of Power in India|last=Menon|first=V.P|publisher=Orient Blackswan|year=1957|isbn=978-8125008842|location=|page=512}}</ref>\n* The fate of Northwest Frontier Province and Sylhet district of Assam was to be decided by a referendum.\n* India would be independent by 15 August 1947.\n* The separate independence of Bengal was ruled out.\n* A boundary commission to be set up in case of partition.\n\nThe Indian political leaders accepted the Plan on 2 June. It could not deal with the question of the [[princely state]]s, which were not British possessions, but on 3 June Mountbatten advised them against remaining independent and urged them to join one of the two new dominions.<ref>Sankar Ghose, ''Jawaharlal Nehru, a biography'' (1993), p. 181</ref> \n\nThe [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]]'s demands for a separate country were thus conceded. The [[Indian National Congress|Congress]]'s position on unity was also taken into account, while making Pakistan as small as possible. Mountbatten's formula was to divide India and, at the same time, retain maximum possible unity.\n\nAbul Kalam Azad expressed concern over the likelihood of violent riots, to which Mountbatten replied:<blockquote>At least on this question I shall give you complete assurance. I shall see to it that there is no bloodshed and riot. I am a soldier and not a civilian. Once the partition is accepted in principle, I shall issue orders to see that there are no communal disturbances anywhere in the country.

There was no conception that population transfers would be necessary because of the partitioning. Religious minorities were expected to stay put in the states they found themselves residing in. However, an exception was made for Punjab, where the transfer of populations was organized because of the communal violence affecting the province, this did not apply to other provinces.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n5c9ta97GeoC&pg=PA40|title=The Long Partition and the Making of Modern South Asia: Refugees, Boundaries, Histories|author=Vazira Fazila-Yacoobali Zamindar|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-231-13847-5|pages=40\u2013|quote=Second, it was feared that if an exchange of populations was agreed to in principle in Punjab, ' there was likelihood of trouble breaking out in other parts of the subcontinent to force Muslims in the Indian Dominion to move to Pakistan. If that happened, we would find ourselves with inadequate land and other resources to support the influx.' Punjab could set a very dangerous precedent for the rest of the subcontinent. Given that Muslims in the rest of India, some 42 million, formed a population larger than the entire population of West Pakistan at the time, economic rationality eschewed such a forced migration. However, in divided Punjab, millions of people were already on the move, and the two governments had to respond to this mass movement. Thus, despite these important reservations, the establishment of the MEO led to an acceptance of a 'transfer of populations' in divided Punjab, too, 'to give a sense of security' to ravaged communities on both sides. A statement of the Indian government's position of such a transfer across divided Punjab was made in the legislature by Neogy on November 18, 1947. He stated that although the Indian government's policy was 'to discourage mass migration from one province to another.' Punjab was to be an exception. In the rest of the subcontinent migrations were not to be on a planned basis, but a matter of individual choice. This exceptional character of movements across divided Punjab needs to be emphasized, for the agreed and 'planned evacuations' by the two governments formed the context of those displacements.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UAkarK3gLDgC&pg=PA149|title=The Making of the Modern Refugee|author=Peter Gatrell|date=2013|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-967416-9|pages=149\u2013|quote=Notwithstanding the accumulated evidence of inter-communal tension, the signatories to the agreement that divided the Raj did not expect the transfer of power and the partition of India to be accompanied by a mass movement of population.

The series of Islamic rulers keeping Delhi as a stronghold of their empires left a vast array of Islamic architecture in Delhi, and a strong Islamic culture permeated the city. In 1911, when the British Raj shifted their colonial capital from Calcutta to Delhi, the nature of the city began slightly changing. The core of the city was called \u2018Lutyens\u2019 Delhi\u2019 named after the British architect Edwin Lutyens, and was designed to service the needs of the small, but growing population of the British elite gentry. Nevertheless, in 1941 the Census listed Delhi's population as being 33.2% Muslim.\n\nAs refugees began pouring into Delhi in 1947, the city was ill equipped to deal with the influx of residents.

By 1950, the government began allowing squatters to construct houses in certain portions of the city. As a result, neighborhoods such as Lajpat Nagar and Patel Nagar sprung into existence, which carry a distinct Punjabi characteristic to this day. However, as thousands of Hindu and Sikh refugees from Punjab fled to the city this created an atmosphere of upheavals as communal pogroms rocked the historical stronghold of Indo-Islamic culture and politics. Pakistani diplomat in Delhi, Hussain, alleged that the Indian government was intent on eliminating Delhi's Muslim population or was indifferent to their fate.

Of these only 3,393 stayed.<ref name=\"Khalidi\" /> In a related trend, intermarriages between Indian and Pakistani Muslims have declined sharply. According to a November 1995 statement of Riaz Khokhar, the Pakistani High Commissioner in New Delhi, the number of cross-border marriages has dropped from 40,000 a year in the 1950s and 1960s to barely 300 annually.<ref name=\"Khalidi\" />\n\nIn the aftermath of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, 3,500 Muslim families migrated from the Indian part of the Thar Desert to the Pakistani section of the Thar Desert.<ref name=\":2\">Hasan, Arif; Mansoor, Raza (2009).

The [[Partition (politics)|partition]] involved the division of two provinces, [[Bengal]] and [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab]], based on district-wise non-Muslim or [[Muslim]] majorities. The partition also saw the division of the [[British Indian Army]], the [[Royal Indian Navy]], the [[Indian Civil Service]], the [[History of rail transport in India|railways]], and the central treasury. The partition was outlined in the [[Indian Independence Act 1947]] and resulted in the dissolution of the [[British Raj]], or [[Crown rule in India]]. The two self-governing countries of India and Pakistan legally came into existence at midnight on 15 August 1947.\n\nThe partition displaced between 10\u201312 million people along religious lines, creating overwhelming refugee crises in the newly constituted dominions. There was large-scale violence, with estimates of loss of life accompanying or preceding the partition disputed and varying between several hundred thousand and two million.{{sfn|Talbot|Singh|2009|p=2}}{{efn|\"The death toll remains disputed to this day with figures ranging from 200,000 to 2 million.\"{{sfn|Talbot|Singh|2009|p=2}}}} The violent nature of the partition created an atmosphere of hostility and suspicion between India and Pakistan that plagues [[Indo-Pakistani relations|their relationship]] to the present.\n\nThe term ''partition of India'' does not cover the [[Bangladesh Liberation War|secession of Bangladesh from Pakistan]] in 1971, nor the earlier separations of [[Burma]] (now [[Myanmar]]) and  [[Ceylon]] (now [[Sri Lanka]]) from the administration of British India.{{efn|Coastal Ceylon, part of the [[Madras Presidency]] of British India from 1796, became the separate [[crown colony]] of [[British Ceylon]] in 1802.

(See [[History of Sri Lanka]] and [[History of Burma]].)}}  The term also does not cover the [[Political integration of India|political integration]] of [[princely states]] into the two new dominions, nor the disputes of annexation or division arising in the princely states of [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]], [[Junagadh State|Junagadh]], and [[Jammu and Kashmir (princely state)|Jammu and Kashmir]], though violence along religious lines did break out in some princely states at the time of the partition.  It does not cover the incorporation of the enclaves of [[French India]] into India during the period 1947\u20131954, nor the annexation of [[Goa]] and other districts of [[Portuguese India]] by India in 1961. Other contemporaneous political entities in the region in 1947, [[Sikkim]], [[Bhutan]], [[Nepal]], and [[the Maldives]] were unaffected by the partition.{{efn|The Himalayan kingdom of [[Sikkim]] was established as a [[princely state]] after the ''Anglo-Sikkimese Treaty'' of 1861.

It is believed that in the Sikh states (except for Jind and Kapurthala) the Maharajas were complacent in the ethnic cleansing of Muslims, while other Maharajas such as those of Patiala, Faridkot, and Bharatpur were heavily involved in ordering them. The ruler of Bharatpur is said to have witnessed the ethnic cleansing of his population, especially at places such as Deeg.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Copland |first1=Ian |title=State, Community and Neighbourhood in Princely North India, c. 1900-1950 |date=2005 |page=140}} </ref>\n\n==Background==\n===Partition of Bengal (1905)===\n{{main|Partition of Bengal (1905)}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:Hindu percent 1909.jpg|1909 Percentage of Hindus.\nFile:Muslim percent 1909.jpg|1909 Percentage of Muslims.\nFile:Sikhs buddhists jains percent1909.jpg|1909 Percentage of Sikhs, Buddhists, and Jains.\nFile:Census of British India by religion, 1921.jpg|The  [[Census of India prior to independence|1921 Census of British India]] shows 69 million Muslims and 217 million Hindus out of a total population of 316 million.\n\n</gallery>\nIn 1905, the viceroy, [[Lord Curzon]], in his second term, divided the largest administrative subdivision in British India, the [[Bengal Presidency]], into the Muslim-majority province of ''[[East Bengal|East Bengal and Assam]]'' and the Hindu-majority ''province'' of ''Bengal'' (present-day Indian states of [[West Bengal]], [[Bihar]], Jharkhand and [[Odisha]]).<ref name=\"spear176\">{{harvnb|Spear|1990|p=176}}</ref> Curzon's act, the [[Partition of Bengal (1905)|Partition of Bengal]]\u2014which some considered administratively felicitous{{By whom|date=May 2016}}, and, which had been contemplated by various colonial administrations since the time of [[Lord William Bentinck]], but never acted upon\u2014was to transform nationalist politics as nothing else before it.<ref name=\"spear176\" /> The Hindu elite of Bengal, among them many who owned land in East Bengal that was leased out to Muslim peasants, protested strongly. The large Bengali Hindu middle-class (the ''[[Bhadralok]]''), upset at the prospect of Bengalis being outnumbered in the new Bengal province by Biharis and Oriyas, felt that Curzon's act was punishment for their political assertiveness.<ref name=\"spear176\" /> The pervasive protests against Curzon's decision took the form predominantly of the ''[[Swadeshi]]'' (\"buy Indian\") campaign and involved a boycott of British goods. Sporadically\u2014but flagrantly\u2014the protesters also took to political violence that involved attacks on civilians.<ref>{{harvnb|Spear|1990|p=176}}, {{harvnb|Stein|Arnold|2010|p=291}}, {{harvnb|Ludden|2002|p=193}}, {{harvnb|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|p=156}}</ref> The violence, however, was not effective, as most planned attacks were either pre-empted by the British or failed.<ref name=\"bandyo260\" /> The rallying cry for both types of protest was the slogan ''[[Bande Mataram]]'' ([[Bengali language|Bengali]], lit: \"Hail to the Mother\"), the title of a song by [[Bankim Chandra Chatterjee]], which invoked a mother goddess, who stood variously for Bengal, India, and the Hindu goddess [[Kali]].<ref name=\"ludden193\">{{harvnb|Ludden|2002|p=193}}</ref> The unrest spread from Calcutta to the surrounding regions of Bengal when Calcutta's English-educated students returned home to their villages and towns.<ref name=\"ludden199\">{{harvnb|Ludden|2002|p=199}}</ref> The religious stirrings of the slogan and the political outrage over the partition were combined as young men, in groups such as [[Jugantar]], took to bombing public buildings, staging armed robberies,<ref name=\"bandyo260\">{{harvnb|Bandyop\u0101dhy\u0101\u1e8fa|2004|p=260}}</ref> and assassinating British officials.<ref name=\"ludden193\" /> Since Calcutta was the imperial capital, both the outrage and the slogan soon became known nationally.<ref name=\"ludden193\" />\n\nThe overwhelming, but predominantly Hindu, protest against the partition of Bengal and the fear of reforms favouring the Hindu majority, now led the Muslim elite in India to meet with the new viceroy [[Lord Minto]] in 1906 and ask for separate electorates for Muslims. In conjunction, they demanded proportional legislative representation reflecting both their status as former rulers and their record of cooperating with the British. This led, in December 1906, to the founding of the [[All-India Muslim League]] in [[Dhaka|Dacca]]. Although Curzon by now had resigned his position over a dispute with his military chief [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] and returned to England, the League was in favor of his partition plan. The Muslim elite's position, which was reflected in the League's position, had crystallized gradually over the previous three decades, beginning with the 1871 Census of British India, which had first estimated the populations in regions of Muslim majority.<ref name=\"ludden200\">{{harvnb|Ludden|2002|p=200}}</ref> For his part, Curzon's desire to court the Muslims of East Bengal had arisen from British anxieties ever since the 1871 census, and in light of the history of Muslims fighting them in the [[Indian Mutiny of 1857|1857 Mutiny]] and the [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]].<ref name=\"ludden200\" /> In the three decades since that census, Muslim leaders across northern India, had intermittently experienced public animosity from some of the new Hindu political and social groups.<ref name=\"ludden200\" /> The [[Arya Samaj]], for example, had not only supported Cow Protection Societies in their agitation,<ref>{{harvnb|Stein|Arnold|2010|p=286}}</ref> but also\u2014distraught at the 1871 Census's Muslim numbers\u2014organized \"reconversion\" events for the purpose of welcoming Muslims back to the Hindu fold.<ref name=\"ludden200\" /> In the [[United Provinces of Agra and Oudh|United Provinces]], Muslims became anxious in the late 19th century Hindu political representation increased, and Hindus were politically mobilized in the [[Hindi-Urdu controversy]] and [[the anti-cow-killing riots]] of 1893.{{Sfn|Talbot|Singh|2009|p=20}} In 1905 Muslim fears increased when [[Lokmanya Tilak|Tilak]] and [[Lala Lajpat Rai|Lajpat Rai]] attempted to rise to leadership positions in the Congress, and the Congress itself rallied around the symbolism of Kali.<ref name=\"ludden200\" /> It was not lost on many Muslims, for example, that the rallying cry, \"Bande Mataram,\" had first appeared in the novel ''[[Anandmath]]'' in which Hindus had battled their Muslim oppressors.<ref name=\"ludden201\">{{harvnb|Ludden|2002|p=201}}</ref> Lastly, the Muslim elite, and among it [[Dhaka Nawab Family|Dacca Nawab]], [[Khwaja Salimullah]], who hosted the League's first meeting in his mansion in [[Shahbag]], was aware that a new province with a Muslim majority would directly benefit Muslims aspiring to political power.<ref name=\"ludden201\" />\n\n=== World War I, Lucknow Pact: 1914\u20131918 ===\n[[file:Indiantroops medical ww1.jpg|thumb|Indian medical orderlies attending to wounded soldiers with the ''Mesopotamian Expeditionary Force'' in [[Mesopotamia]] during [[World War I]]]]\n[[file:Gandhi back in india1915.gif|thumb|[[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]] (seated in the carriage, on the right, eyes downcast, with black flat-top hat) receives a big welcome in Karachi in 1916 after his return to India from South Africa]]\n[[file:Jinnah lucknow pact1916.jpg|thumb|[[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]], seated, third from the left, was a supporter of the Lucknow Pact, which, in 1916, ended the three-way rift between the Extremists, the Moderates and the League]]\n\n[[World War I]] would prove to be a watershed in the imperial relationship between Britain and India. 1.4 million Indian and British soldiers of the [[British Indian Army]] would take part in the war, and their participation would have a wider cultural fallout: news of Indian soldiers fighting and dying with British soldiers, as well as soldiers from [[dominion]]s like Canada and Australia, would travel to distant corners of the world both in newsprint and by the new medium of the radio.<ref name=\"brown-p197-198\">{{harvnb|Brown|1994|pp=197\u2013198}}</ref> India's international profile would thereby rise and would continue to rise during the 1920s.<ref name=\"brown-p197-198\" /> It was to lead, among other things, to India, under its name, becoming a [[League of Nations members#1920: founder members|founding member]] of the [[League of Nations]] in 1920 and participating, under the name, \"Les Indes Anglaises\" (British India), in the [[1920 Summer Olympics]] in Antwerp.<ref>[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1920/1920.pdf Olympic Games Antwerp 1920: Official Report], Nombre de bations representees, p. 168.

Since the [[Ottoman Caliphate|Turkish Sultan]], or ''Khalifah'', also had sporadically claimed guardianship of the Islamic holy sites of [[Mecca]], [[Medina]], and [[Jerusalem]], and since the British and their allies were now in conflict with Turkey, doubts began to increase among some Indian Muslims about the \"religious neutrality\" of the British, doubts that had already surfaced as a result of the [[Partition of Bengal (1905)|reunification of Bengal]] in 1911, a decision that was seen as ill-disposed to Muslims.<ref name=\"brown-p200-201\">{{Harvnb|Brown|1994|pp=200\u2013201}}</ref> In the [[Lucknow Pact]], the League joined the Congress in the proposal for greater self-government that was campaigned for by Tilak and his supporters; in return, the Congress accepted separate electorates for Muslims in the provincial legislatures as well as the Imperial Legislative Council. In 1916, the Muslim League had anywhere between 500 and 800 members and did not yet have its wider following among Indian Muslims of later years; in the League itself, the pact did not have unanimous backing, having largely been negotiated by a group of \"Young Party\" Muslims from the [[United Provinces of Agra and Oudh|United Provinces]] (UP), most prominently, the brothers [[Maulana Mohammad Ali|Mohammad]] and [[Maulana Shaukat Ali|Shaukat Ali]], who had embraced the Pan-Islamic cause.<ref name=\"brown-p200-201\" /> However, it did have the support of a young lawyer from Bombay, [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]], who was later to rise to leadership roles in both the League and the Indian independence movement. In later years, as the full ramifications of the pact unfolded, it was seen as benefiting the Muslim minority elites of provinces like UP and Bihar more than the Muslim majorities of Punjab and Bengal.

In particular, rural candidates, generally sympathetic to British rule and less confrontational, were assigned more seats than their urban counterparts.<ref name=\"brown-p205-207\" /> Seats were also reserved for non-[[Brahmin]]s, landowners, businessmen, and college graduates. The principle of \"communal representation,\" an integral part of the [[Minto-Morley Reforms]], and more recently of the Congress-Muslim League Lucknow Pact, was reaffirmed, with seats being reserved for [[Muslims]], [[Sikhs]], [[Christianity in India|Indian Christians]], [[Anglo-Indians]], and domiciled Europeans, in both provincial and Imperial legislative councils.<ref name=\"brown-p205-207\" /> The Montagu-Chelmsford reforms offered Indians the most significant opportunity yet for exercising legislative power, especially at the provincial level; however, that opportunity was also restricted by the still limited number of eligible voters, by the small budgets available to provincial legislatures, and by the presence of rural and special interest seats that were seen as instruments of British control.<ref name=\"brown-p205-207\" />\n\n===Two-nation theory===\n{{main|Two-nation theory}}\nThe two-nation theory is the [[ideology]] that the primary identity and unifying denominator of [[Muslims]] in the [[Indian subcontinent]] is their religion, rather than their [[language]] or [[ethnicity]], and therefore Indian [[Hindus]] and Muslims are two distinct nations regardless of commonalities.<ref name=\"winks2001\">{{citation |last=Talbot |first=Ian |chapter=Pakistan's Emergence |editor1=Alaine M.

Nevertheless, the Muslim League accepted the Cabinet mission's proposals. The ball was now in Congress's court. Although the grouping scheme preserved a united India, the Congress leadership, above all Jawaharlal Nehru, now slated to be Gandhi's successor, increasingly concluded that under the Cabinet mission proposals the Center would be too weak to achieve the goals of the Congress, which envisioned itself as the successor to the Raj. Looking ahead to the future, the Congress, especially its socialist wing headed by Nehru, wanted a central government that could direct and plan for an India, free of colonialism, that might eradicate its people's poverty and grow into an industrial power. India's business community also supported the idea of a strong central government In a provocative speech on 10 July 1946, Nehru repudiated the notion of compulsory grouping or provinces, the key to Jinnah's Pakistan. Provinces, he said, must be free to join any group.

He had been outraged by Jinnah's Direct Action campaign, which had provoked communal violence across India and by the viceroy's vetoes of his home department's plans to stop the violence on the grounds of constitutionality. Patel severely criticized the viceroy's induction of League ministers into the government and the revalidation of the grouping scheme by the British without Congress approval. Although further outraged at the League's boycott of the assembly and non-acceptance of the plan of 16 May despite entering government, he was also aware that Jinnah enjoyed popular support amongst Muslims, and that an open conflict between him and the nationalists could degenerate into a Hindu-Muslim civil war. The continuation of a divided and weak central government would in Patel's mind, result in the wider fragmentation of India by encouraging more than 600 princely states towards independence.<ref>{{cite book|title=Patel: A Life|last=Gandhi|first=Rajmohan|pages=395\u2013397}}</ref> Between the months of December 1946 and January 1947, Patel worked with civil servant [[V. P. Menon]] on the latter's suggestion for a separate dominion of Pakistan created out of Muslim-majority provinces. Communal violence in Bengal and Punjab in January and March 1947 further convinced Patel of the soundness of partition. Patel, a fierce critic of Jinnah's demand that the Hindu-majority areas of Punjab and Bengal be included in a Muslim state, obtained the partition of those provinces, thus blocking any possibility of their inclusion in Pakistan. Patel's decisiveness on the partition of Punjab and Bengal had won him many supporters and admirers amongst the Indian public, which had been tired of the League's tactics. Still, he was criticized by Gandhi, Nehru, secular Muslims and socialists for a perceived eagerness for the partition. When Lord Mountbatten formally proposed [[the plan on 3 June 1947]], Patel gave his approval and lobbied Nehru and other Congress leaders to accept the proposal. Knowing Gandhi's deep anguish regarding proposals of partition, Patel engaged him in private meetings discussions over the perceived practical unworkability of any Congress-League coalition, the rising violence, and the threat of civil war. At the All India Congress Committee meeting called to vote on the proposal, Patel said:<blockquote>I fully appreciate the fears of our brothers from [the Muslim-majority areas]. Nobody likes the division of India, and my heart is heavy. But the choice is between one division and many divisions. We must face facts. We cannot give way to emotionalism and sentimentality. The Working Committee has not acted out of fear. But I am afraid of one thing, that all our toil and hard work of these many years might go waste or prove unfruitful. My nine months in office have completely disillusioned me regarding the supposed merits of the Cabinet Mission Plan. Except for a few honourable exceptions, Muslim officials from the top down to the chaprasis (peons or servants) are working for the League. The communal veto given to the League in the Mission Plan would have blocked India's progress at every stage. Whether we like it or not, de facto Pakistan already exists in the Punjab and Bengal. Under the circumstances, I would prefer a de jure Pakistan, which may make the League more responsible. Freedom is coming. We have 75 to 80 percent of India, which we can make strong with our genius. The League can develop the rest of the country.<ref>{{cite book|title=Transfer of Power in India|last=Menon|first=V.

Mittal Publications, 1987, p. 38.]</ref> and Congress' approval of the plan, Patel represented India on the Partition Council, where he oversaw the division of public assets and selected the Indian council of ministers with Nehru. However, neither he nor any other Indian leader had foreseen the intense violence and population transfer that would take place with partition. Late in 1946 the [[Attlee ministry|Labour government in Britain]], its exchequer exhausted by the recently concluded World War II, decided to end British rule of India, and in early 1947 Britain announced its intention of transferring power no later than June 1948. However, with the British army unprepared for the potential for increased violence, the new viceroy, [[Louis Mountbatten]], advanced the date for the transfer of power, allowing less than six months for a mutually agreed plan for independence. In June 1947, the nationalist leaders, including Nehru and [[Abul Kalam Azad]] on behalf of the Congress, Jinnah representing the Muslim League, [[B. R. Ambedkar]] representing the [[Dalit|Untouchable]] community, and [[Master Tara Singh]] representing the [[Sikhs]], agreed to a partition of the country along religious lines in stark opposition to Gandhi's views. The predominantly Hindu and Sikh areas were assigned to the new India and predominantly Muslim areas to the new nation of Pakistan; the plan included a partition of the Muslim-majority provinces of Punjab and Bengal. The communal violence that accompanied the announcement of the [[Radcliffe Line]], the line of partition, was even more horrific.\n\nDescribing the violence that accompanied the Partition of India, historians Ian Talbot and Gurharpal Singh write: <blockquote>There are numerous eyewitness accounts of the maiming and mutilation of victims. The catalogue of horrors includes the disembowelling of pregnant women, the slamming of babies' heads against brick walls, the cutting off of the victim's limbs and genitalia, and the displaying of heads and corpses. While previous communal riots had been deadly, the scale and level of brutality during the Partition massacres was unprecedented. Although some scholars question the use of the term '[[genocide]]' concerning the Partition massacres, much of the violence was manifested with genocidal tendencies. It was designed to cleanse an existing generation and prevent its future reproduction.\"{{Sfn|Talbot|Singh|2009|pp=67\u201368}}</blockquote>\n\nOn 14 August 1947, the new [[Dominion of Pakistan]] came into being, with Muhammad Ali Jinnah sworn in as its first Governor-General in [[Karachi]]. The following day, 15 August 1947, India, now a smaller ''Union of India'', became an independent country with official ceremonies taking place in New Delhi, and with Jawaharlal Nehru assuming the office of [[Prime Minister of India|prime minister]], and the viceroy Mountbatten staying on as its first [[Governor-General of India|Governor General]]. Gandhi remained in Bengal to work with the new refugees from the partitioned subcontinent.\n\n==Geographic partition, 1947==\n\n===Mountbatten Plan===\n[[File:Mountbatten 4 august 1947.jpg|thumb|upright|Mountbatten with a countdown calendar to the Transfer of Power in the background]]\nThe actual division of British India between the two new dominions was accomplished according to what has come to be known as the [[\"3 June Plan\" or \"Mountbatten Plan\"]]. It was announced at a press conference by Mountbatten on 3 June 1947, when the date of independence - 15 August 1947 - was also announced. The plan's main points were:\n* Sikhs, Hindus and Muslims in Punjab and Bengal legislative assemblies would meet and vote for partition. If a simple majority of either group wanted partition, then these provinces would be divided.\n* Sind and Baluchistan were to make their own decision.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Transfer of Power in India|last=Menon|first=V.P|publisher=Orient Blackswan|year=1957|isbn=978-8125008842|location=|page=512}}</ref>\n* The fate of Northwest Frontier Province and Sylhet district of Assam was to be decided by a referendum.\n* India would be independent by 15 August 1947.\n* The separate independence of Bengal was ruled out.\n* A boundary commission to be set up in case of partition.\n\nThe Indian political leaders accepted the Plan on 2 June. It could not deal with the question of the [[princely state]]s, which were not British possessions, but on 3 June Mountbatten advised them against remaining independent and urged them to join one of the two new dominions.<ref>Sankar Ghose, ''Jawaharlal Nehru, a biography'' (1993), p. 181</ref> \n\nThe [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]]'s demands for a separate country were thus conceded. The [[Indian National Congress|Congress]]'s position on unity was also taken into account, while making Pakistan as small as possible. Mountbatten's formula was to divide India and, at the same time, retain maximum possible unity.\n\nAbul Kalam Azad expressed concern over the likelihood of violent riots, to which Mountbatten replied:<blockquote>At least on this question I shall give you complete assurance. I shall see to it that there is no bloodshed and riot. I am a soldier and not a civilian. Once the partition is accepted in principle, I shall issue orders to see that there are no communal disturbances anywhere in the country.

There was no conception that population transfers would be necessary because of the partitioning. Religious minorities were expected to stay put in the states they found themselves residing in. However, an exception was made for Punjab, where the transfer of populations was organized because of the communal violence affecting the province, this did not apply to other provinces.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n5c9ta97GeoC&pg=PA40|title=The Long Partition and the Making of Modern South Asia: Refugees, Boundaries, Histories|author=Vazira Fazila-Yacoobali Zamindar|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-231-13847-5|pages=40\u2013|quote=Second, it was feared that if an exchange of populations was agreed to in principle in Punjab, ' there was likelihood of trouble breaking out in other parts of the subcontinent to force Muslims in the Indian Dominion to move to Pakistan. If that happened, we would find ourselves with inadequate land and other resources to support the influx.' Punjab could set a very dangerous precedent for the rest of the subcontinent. Given that Muslims in the rest of India, some 42 million, formed a population larger than the entire population of West Pakistan at the time, economic rationality eschewed such a forced migration. However, in divided Punjab, millions of people were already on the move, and the two governments had to respond to this mass movement. Thus, despite these important reservations, the establishment of the MEO led to an acceptance of a 'transfer of populations' in divided Punjab, too, 'to give a sense of security' to ravaged communities on both sides. A statement of the Indian government's position of such a transfer across divided Punjab was made in the legislature by Neogy on November 18, 1947. He stated that although the Indian government's policy was 'to discourage mass migration from one province to another.' Punjab was to be an exception. In the rest of the subcontinent migrations were not to be on a planned basis, but a matter of individual choice. This exceptional character of movements across divided Punjab needs to be emphasized, for the agreed and 'planned evacuations' by the two governments formed the context of those displacements.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UAkarK3gLDgC&pg=PA149|title=The Making of the Modern Refugee|author=Peter Gatrell|date=2013|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-967416-9|pages=149\u2013|quote=Notwithstanding the accumulated evidence of inter-communal tension, the signatories to the agreement that divided the Raj did not expect the transfer of power and the partition of India to be accompanied by a mass movement of population.

There was a complete breakdown of law and order; many died in riots, massacre, or just from the hardships of their flight to safety.

A massive civil war was looming by the time Mountbatten became Viceroy. After the Second World War, Britain had limited resources,<ref>Lawrence J.

{"title_page": "List of British rugby league champions", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2013}}\n{{Use British English|date=May 2013}}\nThe '''British men's rugby league champions''' are the winners of the highest league in British rugby league, which since [[Super League I|1996]] is the [[Super League]]. Although the league is based in Britain, teams from Europe and North Anerica can win the league due to teams from France and Canada competing in the [[British rugby league system]].\n\nFollowing the schism in 1895 that saw 22 Northern rugby clubs split from the [[Rugby Football Union]] and form the [[Rugby Football League|Northern Union]], the 22 clubs were organised into [[Rugby Football League Championship First Division|one league]]. At the end of the [[1895\u201396 Northern Rugby Football Union season|1895\u201396 season]], [[Manningham FC|Manningham]] were the first club to be crowned champions, finishing one point ahead of [[Halifax RFC|Halifax]].<ref>{{cite news\n | last =Baker\n | first =Andrew\n | title =100 years of rugby league: From the great divide to the Super era\n | newspaper = [[The Independent]]\n | date =1995-08-20\n | url =https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/100-years-of-rugby-league-from-the-great-divide-to-the-super-era-1597130.html\n | accessdate =2009-09-25 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the success of the [[Rugby Football League|Northern Unions]] first season, more clubs defected from the [[Rugby Football Union]] to join the new league. After concerns around travel and costs were expressed, the decision was made that the competition should be split into two separate county championships: Lancashire and Yorkshire Leagues. County leagues were in place for the next five seasons until 1901\u201302 were the top seven sides from each league resigned to merge to form a new league. The only other times that there was no [[Rugby Football League Championship First Division|major championship]] was when there were outbrakes of war.\n\nDuring the late 1980s and early 90s, [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]] became the only full time professional club and dominated in every competition. A new Super League began to be mooted during the [[Super League war]] in Australia as a way for [[Rupert Murdoch]] to gain a upper hand in broadcasting supremacy with the [[Australian Rugby League]]. British clubs were approached to form a Super League with a cash insentive. Part of the deal was switching the sport to summer and the merger of some clubs, the latter not taking place due to huge protest from fans. All four Super League champions; [[St Helens RFC|St Helens]], [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]], [[Bradford Bulls|Bradford]] and [[Leeds Rhinos|Leeds]] have all previously won the old [[Rugby Football League Championship First Devision|First Division]].\n\nOnly three clubs to have been crowned champions are not in existence today. During the reclassification of the Championship in 1901, the league was split into two divisions. [[Manningham FC|Manningham]] were placed in the [[Rugby Football League Championship Second Division|Second Division]], finishing 10th out of 18 teams. At the end of the season a series of meetings was held about establishing a [[Football League]] club in the city. During a annual meeting the committee voted to switch to association football, becoming [[Bradford City]]. A similar situation occurred at [[Bradford FC]] in 1907 when a narrow majority of members voted to withdraw from the Northern Union in favour of association football, forming [[Bradford Park Avenue]]. [[Broughton Rangers]] struggled post war and folded in 1955 after a failed name change to Belle Vue Rangers in 1946.\n\n[[Hunslet FC]] were the fourth former champions to fold after financial issues[http://www.wakefieldexpress.co.uk/news/local-news/rugby-league-star-was-most-expensive-player-1-6493832], player strikes and a stadium fire that led to the club selling the land to developers before being eventually wound up. Unlike the other three clubs who no longer exist, a pheonix club, [[Hunslet RLFC|New Hunslet]] were formed in 1973 and still exist now.<ref name=hawkhist>{{cite web|url=http://www.hunslethawks.co.uk/info/history |title=History |publisher=Hunslet RFLC |accessdate=27 November 2016 }}</ref>\n\n==List==\n===RFL Championship First Division (1895\u20131996)===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:9%\"|Year\n! style=\"width:18%\"|Champions<br />(number of titles)\n! style=\"width:18%\"|Runners-up\n! style=\"width:27%\"|Leading tryscorer<br>(club)\n! style=\"width:1%\"|Trys\n|- style=\"background:#f5faff;\"\n| [[1895\u201396 Northern Rugby Football Union season|1895\u201396]]\n| {{leagueicon|Brisbane|16}} '''[[Manningham F.C.|Manningham]]'''\n|  {{leagueicon|Halifax|16}} [[Halifax R.L.F.C.|Halifax]]\n| {{flagicon|ENG}} [[Jack Hurst]] ({{leagueicon|oldham|16}} [[Oldham RLFC|Oldham]])\n|28\n|- style=\"background:#f5faff;\"\n| colspan=5 style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[1896\u201397 Northern Rugby Football Union season|1896]]\u2013[[1900\u201301 Northern Rugby Football Union season|1901]] [[Rugby league county leagues|County Leagues]]\n|- style=\"background:#f5faff;\"\n| [[1901\u201302 Northern Rugby Football Union season|1901\u201302]]\n|  {{leagueicon|Cronulla|16}} '''[[Broughton Rangers|Broughton]]'''\n|  {{leagueicon|salford city|16}} [[Salford Red Devils|Salford]]\n| {{flagicon|ENG}} [[Robert Wilson (rugby league)|Rob Wilson]] ({{leagueicon|Cronulla|16}} [[Broughton Rangers|Broughton]])\n|38\n|- style=\"background:#f5faff;\"\n| [[1902\u201303 Northern Rugby Football Union season|1902\u201303]]\n| {{leagueicon|Halifax|16}} '''[[Halifax R.L.F.C.|Halifax]]'''\n|  {{leagueicon|salford city|16}} [[Salford Red Devils|Salford]]\n| {{flagicon|ENG}} Evans ({{leagueicon|Leeds|16}} [[Leeds Rhinos|Leeds]])\n|27\n|- style=\"background:#f5faff;\"\n| [[1903\u201304 Northern Rugby Football Union season|1903\u201304]]\n| {{leagueicon|Bradford|16}} '''[[Bradford Park Avenue A.F.C.#Rugby football|Bradford F.C.]]'''\n|  {{leagueicon|salford city|16}} [[Salford Red Devils|Salford]]\n| {{flagicon|SCO}} [[Andrew Hogg (rugby league)|Andrew Hogg]] ({{leagueicon|Cronulla|16}} [[Broughton Rangers|Broughton]])\n|34\n|- style=\"background:#f5faff;\"\n| [[1904\u201305 Northern Rugby Football Union season|1904\u201305]]\n| {{leagueicon|Oldham|16}} '''[[Oldham R.L.F.C.|Oldham]]'''\n| {{leagueicon|Bradford|16}} [[Bradford Park Avenue A.F.C.#Rugby football|Bradford F.C.]]\n| [[James Dechan]] ([[Bradford FC]])\n|31\n|- style=\"background:#f5faff;\"\n| [[1905\u201306 Northern Rugby Football Union season|1905\u201306]]\n| {{leagueicon|Leigh|16}} '''[[Leigh Centurions|Leigh]]'''\n| {{leagueicon|hunslet|16}} [[Hunslet F.C.

Although the league is based in Britain, teams from Europe and North Anerica can win the league due to teams from France and Canada competing in the [[British rugby league system]].\n\nFollowing the schism in 1895 that saw 22 Northern rugby clubs split from the [[Rugby Football Union]] and form the [[Rugby Football League|Northern Union]], the 22 clubs were organised into [[Rugby Football League Championship First Division|one league]]. At the end of the [[1895\u201396 Northern Rugby Football Union season|1895\u201396 season]], [[Manningham FC|Manningham]] were the first club to be crowned champions, finishing one point ahead of [[Halifax RFC|Halifax]].<ref>{{cite news\n | last =Baker\n | first =Andrew\n | title =100 years of rugby league: From the great divide to the Super era\n | newspaper = [[The Independent]]\n | date =1995-08-20\n | url =https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/100-years-of-rugby-league-from-the-great-divide-to-the-super-era-1597130.html\n | accessdate =2009-09-25 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the success of the [[Rugby Football League|Northern Unions]] first season, more clubs defected from the [[Rugby Football Union]] to join the new league. After concerns around travel and costs were expressed, the decision was made that the competition should be split into two separate county championships: Lancashire and Yorkshire Leagues. County leagues were in place for the next five seasons until 1901\u201302 were the top seven sides from each league resigned to merge to form a new league. The only other times that there was no [[Rugby Football League Championship First Division|major championship]] was when there were outbrakes of war.\n\nDuring the late 1980s and early 90s, [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]] became the only full time professional club and dominated in every competition. A new Super League began to be mooted during the [[Super League war]] in Australia as a way for [[Rupert Murdoch]] to gain a upper hand in broadcasting supremacy with the [[Australian Rugby League]]. British clubs were approached to form a Super League with a cash insentive. Part of the deal was switching the sport to summer and the merger of some clubs, the latter not taking place due to huge protest from fans. All four Super League champions; [[St Helens RFC|St Helens]], [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]], [[Bradford Bulls|Bradford]] and [[Leeds Rhinos|Leeds]] have all previously won the old [[Rugby Football League Championship First Devision|First Division]].\n\nOnly three clubs to have been crowned champions are not in existence today. During the reclassification of the Championship in 1901, the league was split into two divisions. [[Manningham FC|Manningham]] were placed in the [[Rugby Football League Championship Second Division|Second Division]], finishing 10th out of 18 teams. At the end of the season a series of meetings was held about establishing a [[Football League]] club in the city. During a annual meeting the committee voted to switch to association football, becoming [[Bradford City]]. A similar situation occurred at [[Bradford FC]] in 1907 when a narrow majority of members voted to withdraw from the Northern Union in favour of association football, forming [[Bradford Park Avenue]]. [[Broughton Rangers]] struggled post war and folded in 1955 after a failed name change to Belle Vue Rangers in 1946.\n\n[[Hunslet FC]] were the fourth former champions to fold after financial issues[http://www.wakefieldexpress.co.uk/news/local-news/rugby-league-star-was-most-expensive-player-1-6493832], player strikes and a stadium fire that led to the club selling the land to developers before being eventually wound up. Unlike the other three clubs who no longer exist, a pheonix club, [[Hunslet RLFC|New Hunslet]] were formed in 1973 and still exist now.<ref name=hawkhist>{{cite web|url=http://www.hunslethawks.co.uk/info/history |title=History |publisher=Hunslet RFLC |accessdate=27 November 2016 }}</ref>\n\n==List==\n===RFL Championship First Division (1895\u20131996)===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:9%\"|Year\n! style=\"width:18%\"|Champions<br />(number of titles)\n! style=\"width:18%\"|Runners-up\n! style=\"width:27%\"|Leading tryscorer<br>(club)\n! style=\"width:1%\"|Trys\n|- style=\"background:#f5faff;\"\n| [[1895\u201396 Northern Rugby Football Union season|1895\u201396]]\n| {{leagueicon|Brisbane|16}} '''[[Manningham F.C.|Manningham]]'''\n|  {{leagueicon|Halifax|16}} [[Halifax R.L.F.C.|Halifax]]\n| {{flagicon|ENG}} [[Jack Hurst]] ({{leagueicon|oldham|16}} [[Oldham RLFC|Oldham]])\n|28\n|- style=\"background:#f5faff;\"\n| colspan=5 style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[1896\u201397 Northern Rugby Football Union season|1896]]\u2013[[1900\u201301 Northern Rugby Football Union season|1901]] [[Rugby league county leagues|County Leagues]]\n|- style=\"background:#f5faff;\"\n| [[1901\u201302 Northern Rugby Football Union season|1901\u201302]]\n|  {{leagueicon|Cronulla|16}} '''[[Broughton Rangers|Broughton]]'''\n|  {{leagueicon|salford city|16}} [[Salford Red Devils|Salford]]\n| {{flagicon|ENG}} [[Robert Wilson (rugby league)|Rob Wilson]] ({{leagueicon|Cronulla|16}} [[Broughton Rangers|Broughton]])\n|38\n|- style=\"background:#f5faff;\"\n| [[1902\u201303 Northern Rugby Football Union season|1902\u201303]]\n| {{leagueicon|Halifax|16}} '''[[Halifax R.L.F.C.|Halifax]]'''\n|  {{leagueicon|salford city|16}} [[Salford Red Devils|Salford]]\n| {{flagicon|ENG}} Evans ({{leagueicon|Leeds|16}} [[Leeds Rhinos|Leeds]])\n|27\n|- style=\"background:#f5faff;\"\n| [[1903\u201304 Northern Rugby Football Union season|1903\u201304]]\n| {{leagueicon|Bradford|16}} '''[[Bradford Park Avenue A.F.C.#Rugby football|Bradford F.C.]]'''\n|  {{leagueicon|salford city|16}} [[Salford Red Devils|Salford]]\n| {{flagicon|SCO}} [[Andrew Hogg (rugby league)|Andrew Hogg]] ({{leagueicon|Cronulla|16}} [[Broughton Rangers|Broughton]])\n|34\n|- style=\"background:#f5faff;\"\n| [[1904\u201305 Northern Rugby Football Union season|1904\u201305]]\n| {{leagueicon|Oldham|16}} '''[[Oldham R.L.F.C.|Oldham]]'''\n| {{leagueicon|Bradford|16}} [[Bradford Park Avenue A.F.C.#Rugby football|Bradford F.C.]]\n| [[James Dechan]] ([[Bradford FC]])\n|31\n|- style=\"background:#f5faff;\"\n| [[1905\u201306 Northern Rugby Football Union season|1905\u201306]]\n| {{leagueicon|Leigh|16}} '''[[Leigh Centurions|Leigh]]'''\n| {{leagueicon|hunslet|16}} [[Hunslet F.C.

He is voiced by [[Matt Hullum]], co-creator of the series, and first appeared at the end of {{rvbep|1|Episode 1}}. He has a [[Southern American English|Southern accent]], and has a military background and briefly joined the [[ODST]]s. Sarge is somewhat bloodthirsty, and the only Blood Gulch soldier on either team to actually be serious about war. As a result, Sarge gets unsatisfied at times of peace and is often willing to join new battles, which in Season 15 led him to delusional battles while in retirement \u2013 first creating an army of robots, then declaring war on [[gravity]] \u2013 and then join the Blues and Reds to help the war on the UNSC, betraying the Reds and Blues. His preferred weapon is a [[shotgun]], which he carries at all times. Sarge has a passionate disgust for Grif, demonstrated by his repeated willingness to sacrifice Grif during combat missions as well as creating numerous contingency plans that all consist of killing Grif outright. He has something of a father-son relationship with Simmons, but is either oblivious to Simmons' feelings or just doesn't seem to care. He displays little knowledge of strategy or tactics and his plans are often horrible suicide missions, but he is shown to be a good mechanic, able to repair Jeeps with limited supplies and construct complex droids, and a good motivational speaker, speaking to both teams at various times throughout the later seasons. Sarge's real name is never revealed on screen. In Season 14, the cameraman asks Sarge for his name and rank, to which he replies 'Sarge'. Thinking he simply gave his rank, Sarge is then asked for his name, to which he insists that he 'just said that'. In Season 15, in exchange for their help, he tells Dylan and Jax his name. Though it is never said on screen, with Jax simply asking if it is 'Russian, Scandinavian or Pig Latin' as it 'sounded like 57 syllables' to which Sarge replies by saying that 'you need to use a Mandarin translator and the fifth letter is an emoji'.\n\nSarge is played by Saul Portillo in the live-action, crossover episode ''Immersion: The Warthog Flip''.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://achievementhunter.roosterteeth.com/episode/immersion-season-4-the-warthog-flip-behind-the-scenes |publisher=[[Rooster Teeth]] |date=October 12, 2016 |title=Immersion: The Warthog Flip - Behind The Scenes |accessdate=October 13, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Simmons====\n[[Captain (armed forces)|Captain]] Richard \"Dick\" Simmons ([[Gus Sorola]]), upon his introduction, is the second-in-command of the Red Team, being an attentive and [[sycophant]]ic follower to Sarge. Simmons and Grif were the first two characters to ever appear in Red vs. Blue, appearing at the start of {{rvbep|1|Episode 1}}, and both are friends in spite of their constant bickering and personality clashes. Simmons is shown to be logical, practical and intelligent, showing extensive knowledge of technology and computers. However, his reasonable inquiries and effective battle plans and strategies are always overlooked by Sarge. Simmons even twice defected to the Blues after getting frustrated with Sarge. Simmons' worthiness is often hindered by his lack of self-confidence, insecurity (particularly regarding talking to women) and panicky nature - he loses control in time-sensitive or complicated situations, as well as in situations that highlight his [[Ophidiophobia|fear of snakes]].\n\n====Grif====\n[[Captain (armed forces)|Captain]] Dexter Grif ([[Geoff Ramsey]]) is noted for being lazy, grumpy, and gluttonous, \nwhich led to Sarge disliking him and constant bickering with his friend Simmons. In spite of his abrasive nature, Grif has a begrudging kinship to his teammates, and will eventually come to their aid. While ''Red vs. Blue: The Ultimate Fan Guide'' stated Grif was forced into the Red Army in a military draft, Season 16 instead reveals Grif enlisted after dropping out of college in [[Ithaca, New York]]. Grif is shown to be relatively adept at driving vehicles, even managing to fly a Pelican and a Hornet with next to no experience with aircraft. He is also shown to be exceptionally hard to kill, being able to survive multiple shots, being run over by a tank, and falling from extreme heights. He was twice promoted, first to Sergeant before ''Reconstruction'' once he was relocated out of Blood Gulch, but is later demoted to the fictitious rank of \"Minor Junior Private Negative First Class\" because of a deal between Sarge and Agent Washington; and then to Captain as leader of his own squad of Chorus' New Republic, which leads Sarge to ask a promotion to Colonel to continue outranking Grif.\n\nJoe Nicolosi, who wrote and directed Season 15 and 16, has Grif as a favourite character, and thus he is heavily featured in those seasons. In the former, while he refuses to join the quest that leads the Reds and Blues out of their retirement moon, Grif goes insane from loneliness and guilt, eventually being brought by Locus to save his friends from the Blues and Reds. In ''The Shisno Paradox'' after convincing the Reds and Blues to get pizza, Grif decides to use what he learned from a book in [[narrative structure]] and avoid [[inciting incident|\"incendiary incidents\"]] that would lead to new adventures, going all the way to crashing the crew's ship to not answer a call from Locus. However, on the way to Grif's favourite pizzeria, which ends up destroyed, they are roped into a time-travelling plot by Donut.\n\nBeginning in ''[[Halo 3]]'', Grif has had a multiplayer game based around him called \"Grifball\". Inspired by a throwaway line in [[Red vs. Blue (season 4)#Hunting Time|season 4]] where Sarge comments that shooting Grif \"is the best game since Grifball!\", Rooster Teeth developed a [[rugby football|rugby]]-like gaming mode where Grif would be repeatedly killed, as the objective is to carry a bomb all the way to the opposing team's [[Goal (sport)|goal]], with the player holding the bomb having his armour changed to Grif's orange. Along with the other players trying to stop the \"Grif\" with Energy Swords and Gravity Hammers, scoring also leads the bomb to explode, often killing the carrier. As summed up by Burnie Burns, \"everyone in the game is constantly trying to hammer-smash Grif and even if he scores, he explodes. Either way, Sarge wins.\"<ref>[http://www.grifballhub.com/respect-your-roots-agla-winter-league-08/ GrifballHub: Respect Your Roots-AGLA Winter League 08]</ref>\n\n====Donut====\n[[Private (rank)|Private]] Franklin Delano Donut (Dan Godwin) hails from [[Iowa]], and first appears in Episode 3 of {{rvbep|Season 1}} as a new recruit. He originally sported standard-issue red armour, but due to an inadvertent series of events, he is eventually given a pink armour, whose color Donut often denies, calling it \"Lightish Red\", and even causes the Blues to mistake him for a woman in the first two seasons. The pink armour also changes Donut's personality and makes him ambiguously homosexual, constantly spewing double entendres and talking with a more feminine attitude. While Donut is affable, his garrulous personality tends to annoy other members of the Red Team, along with being childish and gullible - Lopez, in particular, hates Donut's bad attempts at translating his Spanish speech. Donut's biggest combat skill is a proficiency in throwing grenades.\n\nWhile Donut was one of the focal characters in ''The Blood Gulch Chronicles'', he is often relegated in later seasons, even being supposedly killed in the ''Recreation'' season finale, later revealed to have sent him into Recovery Mode, which locks down the user's armor in the event of heavy injuries. This lack of focus made Joe Nicolosi decide to make Donut the plot-driving character in ''The Shisno Paradox''. There, after being zapped by a time machine in the previous season's last episode, Donut becomes unstuck in time and his body is destroyed by various temporal distortions. Once reunited with the Reds and Blues, he says he met God and gives his friends time-portal guns that allow travelling through time and space. However, the \"God\" was actually an ancient deity called Chrovos, who wanted to cause a [[temporal paradox]]  that would break reality and thus release him from his prison. Donut refuses to believe Chrovos is evil and serves as a mole with the Reds and Blues, stealing the Hammer. After realizing Chrovos intends to kill his friends, Donut turns against him and engages Doc in a battle throughout time, ultimately defeating Doc with a well timed frag. Donut then uses the Hammer to partially seal Chrovos in his prison while the Reds and Blues inadvertently cause the paradox. Donut, having been outside time, keeps his memories and attempts to warn the Reds and Blues, who are trapped in a singularity reliving past adventures. Finding his attempts to warn them are only making things worse, Donut realizes Agent Washington is outside of time and thus also unaffected. Donut then travels to the point where the paradox started and begins searching for Washington.\n\n====Lopez The Heavy====\n'''Lopez the Heavy''' (Spanish: ''Lopez la Pesado'' [sic], full name Droid #01011331123;<ref name=\"S3DVDProfiles\">[[Rooster Teeth Productions]] (2005). Character profiles. In ''{{rvbep|season 3|Red vs. Blue Season Three}}'' [DVD]. [[Buda, Texas]]: Rooster Teeth Productions.</ref> voiced by [[Burnie Burns]]) is a robotic mechanic built by Sarge with a robot kit. He does not speak for most of Season 1, and it is eventually revealed that he is a robot that is missing a speech unit. Sarge orders a speech unit, but accidentally damages it with a static electric discharge during the installation process, which causes Lopez to speak only Spanish. Sarge sees it as an improvement because the enemy won't be able to understand him if he's ever captured, despite not knowing Spanish himself. However, he is able to understand English just fine. The extent to which the characters understand Lopez varies for the sake of comedy, with Sarge pretending to know what Lopez is saying, and Donut's narrow grasp of Spanish leading to bad mistranslations. In his state of loneliness and guilt in Season 15, Grif becomes fluent in Spanish and is able to communicate fully with Lopez. Lopez has a stoic, tough personality, although as time went on he developed a pessimistic view, often questioning his orders and making sarcastic remarks about his teammates. A running gag, starting with {{rvbep|Season 3}}, has Lopez being reduced to just a head, though he does get a new body (which is almost always destroyed eventually) from time to time.\n\n===Blue Team===\n<!-- FAIR USE of Rvb Blue Team Halo 3 Engine.jpg: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Rvb Blue Team Halo 3 Engine.jpg for rationale -->\n[[File:Rvb Blue Team Halo 3 Engine.jpg|thumb|300px|The {{rvbchar|Blue Team}}, from left to right: Tucker (Aqua), Tex (Black),  Epsilon-Church (the monitor), Sheila (the tank), Alpha-Church (Cobalt) and Caboose (Blue).]]\n\n====Church====\n[[Private (rank)|Private]] Leonard L. Church (Burns) is the [[de facto]] leader of the Blood Gulch Blue Team. Rooster Teeth often uses Church, who has an irate disposition,<ref name=\"RvBS4DVDCommentEp76\">Burns, ''et al.'', 2006, Audio Commentary, episode 76.</ref> to advance the plot by managing the situation at hand.<ref name=\"RvBS1DVDCommentEp18\">Burns, ''et al.'', 2003, Audio Commentary, episode 18.</ref> Another characteristic of Church is his terrible aim, mostly with his signature [[sniper rifle]], though at one point he cannot hit a soldier standing a few feet away with a pistol.\n\nTo provide a twist in character development, Burns decided to kill Church early in the series and have him return as a \"ghost.\" In ''Reconstruction'', Washington reveals to Church that he is the Alpha AI from which the other Freelancer Program AIs originated. As like in ''Halo'' canon, smart AIs are based on an actual person, Church was based on the director of Project Freelancer, the original Dr. Leonard Church. Through psychological torture, the Alpha tried to keep his sanity by breaking off parts of his personality, that become the AI fragments.\n\nWhile shortly after his reveal as the Alpha Church is caught up in an [[electromagnetic pulse]] blast and destroyed, the character returns starting in ''Reconstruction'' through one of its fragments, Epsilon, which was the Alpha's memories. Upon his creation, Epsilon went rampant during an at being implanted into Washington, causing Wash to go insane, the AI implantation program to be cancelled, and Epsilon to be sent into storage. In ''Reconstruction'', Washington and Church retrieve the Epsilon capsule from a Freelancer facility, which Wash then gives to Caboose. In ''Revelation'', it is revealed Caboose is trying to transfer the AI from the capsule to a new robotic body while telling stories to him, given Epsilon responds well to them given his status as a memory keeper. In the desert where Tucker was reassigned, Caboose finds a round artifact (a Monitor from ''Halo''), and transfers Epsilon into it. Epsilon-Church has residual memories of the original Church, inheriting his voice and personality. However, his memories of Alpha's life on Blood Gulch are at first limited to the stories that Caboose had told him.\n\nIn ''Revelation'', memory flashes of Epsilon-Church eventually lead him to a Freelancer facility, where he brings Tex back to life and transfers himself into a new human-like robot body, whose armor is the same color as the old Church's. Tex brings Epsilon to another Freelancer base and activates his recovery beacon as bait for Washington and the Meta. However, the Meta then captures Tex in a storage unit. After the battle, Church enters the unit to retrieve her.\n\nIn Season 9, Epsilon makes a recreation of Blood Gulch based on his memories inside the storage unit waiting for Tex to come to him. After reuniting with Tex and believing the memory unit to be failing, he decides to forget her to find inner peace before what he believes will be his demise. Caboose then brings him out of the memory unit. It is then revealed that Carolina helped them rescue Epsilon-Church so that he can help her kill the director. After Carolina confronts the director at the end of Season 10, Epsilon remains as the former Freelancer's partner.\n\nDuring Season 13, Epsilon is shown to malfunction when overworked by  Carolina. This eventually leads to the Church's ultimate demise: to ensure Tucker can wear The Meta's suit, Epsilon deconstructs himself into different Fragments, each running one of the suit's enhancements. Once the battle is over, the fragments vanish.\n\nIn Season 14, it is revealed that the body of Church prior to his \"death\" in Season 1 was actually Pvt. Jimmy, who was talked about also in Season 1. Pvt. Jimmy was implanted with the Alpha before going into Blood Gulch, and that A.I. turned Pvt. Jimmy into Pvt. Leonard Church.\n\nIn season 15, the Reds and Blues are lured out of their retirement moon by a distress call which seemed to be from Church. However, it is later revealed it was a ruse by the Blues and Reds, who edited a message from the original Church to lure in the Reds and Blues to them. Still, through Loco's time machine, a portal is opened to Blood Gulch during the first season, and Caboose uses the opportunity to tells Church a heartfelt goodbye, even if it means he will never see his friend again. In the post-credits scene, a confused Church resolves to forget this conversation ever happened.\n\n====Tucker====\n[[Captain (armed forces)|Captain]] Lavernius Tucker ([[Jason Salda\u00f1a]]) is known for his womanizing and oversexed mind, uttering the catchphrase \"bow chicka bow wow\" at every phrase he deems unintentionally sexual. His signature weapon is the Energy Sword, which Tucker finds in Season 3 and only works for him. The weapon also leads Tucker to be attacked by an Alien and impregnated with a parasitic embryo, which later becomes his hybrid son Junior. He turns out to be the best combatant among the original Reds and Blues, single-handedly fending off C.T.'s team in ''Recreation'', and stabbing The Meta with his sword in the final fight of ''Revelation''. Two running gags about Tucker had him complaining he never gets to use the Sniper Rifle \u2013 though in Season 5, Tucker turns out to shoot well with it \u2013 and his armor getting coated with \"black stuff\" whenever he goes through a teleporter.\n\nAfter the Blood Gulch Chronicles, it is stated that Tucker and Junior were recruited as ambassadors between the humans and aliens, and transferred to a desert. After being absent from ''Reconstruction'' aside from a brief voice appearance calling Freelancer Command about his mission, he returns in ''Recreation'' as Sarge, Caboose and Grif go to the desert. In the Chorus Trilogy, Tucker's evolution into a capable leader and combatant is a major theme, as he helps stop the Chorus Civil War, fend off the invaders who played both sides, and eventually wear The Meta's armor in a last stand against Charon Industries' troops.\n\nIn Season 15 and 16, Tucker has to deal with responsibility (he is forced to pay child support for several illegitimate children after impregnating several women on Chorus, and his recklessness to fight the Zealots guns blazing causes Washington to get shot) and egotism (he tries much to impress Sister, even becoming king of [[Camelot]], which he renames \"Camelto\", until she calls out on Tucker's inflated image of himself).\n\n====Caboose====\n[[Captain (armed forces)|Captain]] Michael J. Caboose ([[Joel Heyman]]) first appears in Episode 3 of {{rvbep|Season 1}} as a new recruit for the {{rvbchar|Blue Team}}. He is portrayed as one of the more eccentric characters in the series, with behavior varying from merely somewhat dim-witted in Season 1 to almost completely divorced from reality from Season 3 onward. This is most likely due to Omega ('O'Malley') possessing him in Season 1 and permanently damaging his mental faculties after he left. It is stated that Tucker and Church once \"rebooted\" his armor, causing his life support systems to shut down - including his oxygen supply, leading to brain damage that hindered Caboose's mental state. Despite his shortcomings, he is arguably the most genuinely loyal character and frequently displays above-average physical strength, which Church and Tucker describe as \"God's way of compensating\". He also shows some knowledge of machinery, being able to transfer Epsilon from a storage unit to a Monitor in ''Recreation'' and being able to revive a Mantis Droid in Season 11, who Caboose renamed \"Freckles\".\n\nHis unusual behavior frequently earns him scorn and disrespect from the other characters. It is a running gag that Caboose either injures or kills anyone that he attempts to help, starting with the death of Church in the eighth episode of the series. In season 13, Freckles' memory chip is placed in Caboose's Assault Rifle to prevent him from shooting others, as whenever Caboose pulls the trigger, it instead fires confetti.\n\nEver since ''Reconstruction'', Caboose wears a Mark V Mjolnir helmet, instead of Mark VI. This was done to make him easier to differentiate from Church, as their shades of blue look too similar on ''Halo 3'', and also because the producers felt the Mark V's simplistic helmet design  better suited Caboose's personality.\n\nDuring Season 15, Caboose does not believe Church is truly gone, thinking people come back to life if you care about them. Upon meeting the Blues and Reds, Caboose begins a friendship with his counterpart Loco. After being shown during imprisonment that the distress call from Church was a ruse, Caboose finally begins to accept that Church is truly gone. In the finale, Loco's machine opens a time portal to Blood Gulch, allowing Caboose to say goodbye to a confused Church.\n\nIn part due to positive early fan reaction, [[Burnie Burns]], the main writer for the series, focused the storyline on Caboose and {{rvbchar|Donut}} ([[Dan Godwin]]), the Red Team's rookie. In an early episode of the Rooster Teeth Podcast, Joel Heyman, Caboose's voice actor, revealed that his motivation for the character was that Caboose is \"the only character who is aware that he's in a video game.\" Heyman also explained during [[RTX (event)|RTX]] 2017 that Caboose's childish speech is because he \"treats everything as if it was an animal\". Caboose will not hesitate to shoot a \"friend\" if he is asked to \"help\" them.\n\n====Freckles====\n'''Freckles''' (originally voiced by Shane Newville) was an HRUNTING/YGGDRASIL Mark IX \"Mantis\" battle robot that was activated by Caboose, who later took him as a pet. After the Reds and Blues crash landed in an unknown location, in Season 11, Caboose discovered the damaged robot hidden in a cave and successfully repaired it. \"Freckles\", named so due to the spots on his face, caused great unease to everyone on both teams, as Freckles obeyed Caboose's every whim, according him the respect due a superior officer. This included the robot acting as Caboose's military-justice enforcer when Washington (accidentally) gave command of the team to Caboose through a poor choice of words during a heated argument. During Caboose's tenure as team leader, everyone did as he said because otherwise Freckles would find them guilty of disobeying a superior officer in a time of war and issue the appropriate punishment: execution. Caboose eventually gave control of Freckles to Agent Washington when the two reconciled. He ended up destroyed during a strike by Locus and the Federal Army of Chorus.\n\nIn Season 12, Locus gave to the Reds and Blues the only reminder of Freckles, a memory chip, which turned out to have a tracker device on it. This was removed, and then the A.I. was placed into Caboose's Assault Rifle, which when combined with the gun's smart scope and stabilizer system, allowed Freckles to direct the gun to take out targets with efficiency. In Season 13, Freckles' ammunition was alternated with confetti, whenever Caboose pulls the trigger on his gun to prevent his constant injuries to teammates, and bullets when the robot was in control. This even helped the defeat of Felix once the mercenary attempted to fire with Caboose's rifle, only for confetti to come out and Freckles to recoil the gun into Felix's face.\n\nIn Season 15, Freckles (now voiced by Miles Luna) gets a new Mantis body, however a miniature one that barely reaches the characters' knees.\n\n====Sister====\n'''Kaikaina \"Sister\" Grif''' (Rebecca Frasier) is Grif's younger sister, who wears yellow armor. Her given name is even [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] for younger sibling, albeit of the same sex (a sister to a male is \"kaikuahine\"). She was taken care of by Grif once their mother left for the circus - being both the fat lady and the [[bearded lady]] - and once he joined the army, Sister decided to enlist as well. She was brought into Blood Gulch on season 5, with her ship landing in the middle of the canyon and explaining Command had sent her as a new recruit since one team member will be promoted to replace their deceased commanding officer. However, in following episodes she is revealed to be [[colorblind]] and is actually part of Blue team. Sister then joins the Blues, initially entering conflicts with Tex but then bonding.\n\nSister is noted for her stupidity, promiscuity, and disturbing revelations - sometimes of a sexual nature - that other characters comment with \"Yeah. Wait, what?\", such as that she attempted to overdose on Aspirin and [[female ejaculation|has the ability to ejaculate]].\n\nSister is the only remaining Blue soldier in the canyon come ''Reconstruction''. With the conflict stuck in a stalemate, as Sarge cannot bring himself into attacking a woman, she throws raves every night and refuses to give Washington information, believing he is a cop. After Sarge leaves to go after Grif and Simmons, Lopez strangles Sister to ensure the Reds' victory, before departing himself. However, she ends up surviving, as revealed in a cameo during Season 13. In season 15, Sister is revealed to organize events such as festivals and conventions on Blood Gulch to make usage of the abandoned bases. By the end of the season, she is reunited with her brother once the New Republic troops, who she met while in a business meeting on Chorus, arrive to check on the Reds and Blues, officially rejoining the main cast. In ''The Shisno Paradox'', Sister is paired with Tucker in time travelling misadventures, mostly regarding Sister's intent to have sex with past celebrities.\n\nAlthough Rebecca Frasier was a good friend of the Rooster Teeth production crew, Burnie Burns intended to allow other women to audition for the role of Sister despite the pressure of the other members. He notes two other girls auditioned for the role before Frasier was given her chance, but when she began auditioning the team made something of a joke out of the audition, slipping in increasingly more vulgar lines to see how far Frasier would go before refusing to read them. Upon realizing she had no such limits, Frasier was cast as Sister and the role was re-written as a far more promiscuous character to fit with the lines she had read in the audition.<ref name=\"S5DVDComm\">Rooster Teeth Productions (2007).

Buda, Texas: Rooster Teeth Productions.</ref>\n\n===Former Freelancer Agents===\n====Carolina====\n'''Agent Carolina''' (Jen Brown) is a defected member of Project Freelancer, who was believed dead after The Meta threw her off a cliff after stealing her two AI units, but is revealed to be alive at the end of Season 9. Carolina turns out to have recruited the Reds and Blues to retrieve Epsilon so he could lead her to Project Freelancer's director, who she intends to kill.\nDuring the flashbacks of Seasons 9 and 10, Carolina is revealed to have been the top Freelancer agent until Tex arrived. For being extremely competitive against Tex, even willing to risk the mission's completion in order to best her rival, Carolina ends up becoming bitter and easily-angered, which drives her Freelancer partners away. Still, in spite of initially being obsessed with killing the Director, once Carolina finds him by the end of Season 10, she only confronts Dr. Church and calls out on his behavior, in a way that also reveals to the viewer that the director is Carolina's father. She is a proficient fighter, and has many enhancements in her armor, such as active camouflage and speed boost.\n\nAlongside Epsilon, Carolina is absent from Season 11, returning halfway through Season 12 to reveal that in her search for Freelancer-based equipment, she uncovered the conspiracy taking place on planet Chorus, leading the Reds and Blues on a mission to expose the mercenaries and the corporation that were keeping the planet in a civil war. In Season 15, Carolina is revealed to have, along with Tex, triggered Temple's wish to take down Project Freelancer and the UNSC, as a fight between both during a [[capture the flag]] match in Desert Gulch killed Temple's friend Biff. Even if weakened by spending days paralyzed with her armor locked, Carolina helped the Reds and Blues defeat Temple. In ''The Shisno Paradox'' Carolina leaves for Chorus to check on the recovery of the hospitalized Washington, but without revealing him about his brain damage. She eventually rejoins the Reds and Blues and goes with them to the past trying to prevent Wash from getting wounded in the first place.\n\n====Wash====\nA former member of Project Freelancer, '''Agent Washington''', also known as \"Wash\", true name David ([[Shannon McCormick]]), is infamous for an incident in his past where his AI, Epsilon, malfunctioned while still in his system. According to Washington, Epsilon's mind allegedly broke down and the AI would later \"commit suicide\" while still in Washington's head. This left his sanity questionable and as a result of the accident, Washington distrusts AI constructs, which made him fit for the Recovery Program as his commanders knew he would not take the retrieved AI for himself.\n\nHe is introduced as the main protagonist of the mini-series ''Recovery One'', where he is sent to go after dead Freelancers in hope to retrieving their AI. Wash returns in ''Reconstruction'', where to go after the Meta, he ends up recruiting the Reds and Blues given they had experience with an AI, O'Malley. After destroying the Meta's AI in the season finale with an EMP, Wash is imprisoned by the UNSC due to him destroying protected classified military property . But in ''Recreation'', he was offered freedom in exchange for the retrieval of the Epsilon AI while assisted by the Meta, causing Wash to turn against the Red and Blue teams due to Caboose not taking Epsilon to the authorities and keeping him and Sarge deleting the Blue team from all records and even shoot Lopez and Donut dead. However by ''Revelation'', upon capturing a copy of the Tex AI, The Meta betrays Washington in order to pursue his original goal of gaining the full Alpha AI. Wash is subsequently injured by The Meta and saved by the Red and Blue teams. He fakes his death and joins the Blue Team, wearing Church's armor with his original yellow trim, so as to not be caught by authorities.\n\nIn Season 10 it is revealed that Wash essentially replaces Church on the Blue Team to remain incognito, and throughout the season he is loyal to Carolina despite not agreeing with most of her methods, eventually coming to her rescue on the Director's base alongside the Reds and Blues. In Chapter 6, Wash was shown without his helmet, however only the back of his head was shown, revealing that he has spikey blonde hair.\n\nIn Season 11, Wash assumes command of Blue Team as they try living stranded following a shipwreck. After their base is attacked by the Federal Army of Chorus, Wash sacrifices himself and orders Freckles to collapse the cave leading to the New Republic base and is knocked out and captured by Locus seconds later. After being reunited with the other Reds and Blues the following season, Wash helps them in their mission to drive away the mercenaries attacking the planet, entering particular conflicts with Locus, who considers Washington to have lost his value as a soldier.\n\nIn Season 15, Wash and Carolina separate from the Reds and Blues to investigate on the death of other Freelancers. They are still reunited with the Reds and Blues and meet the Blues and Reds, with their leader Temple secretly traps them in armor lock mode in a room full of Freelancers who fell victim as well. After days paralyzed, which caused extreme fatigue even caused him to hallucinate, Wash is released by Locus, and due to his hindered mental state is shot in the throat when he wanders into a battlefield. Locus promptly puts him onboard his ship, and goes to get Wash medical attention on Chorus. ''The Shisno Paradox'' reveals the injury resulted in Wash suffering from [[cerebral hypoxia]], giving him bouts of frustration and short-term memory loss, as well as being unable to recall the events of Season 15. After regrouping with the Reds and Blues, Wash is unaware of his condition until Carolina reveals it to him. Enraged, Wash storms off. Frustrated, the Reds and Blues time travel to prevent Wash from being shot in the first place, causing a [[temporal paradox]] that breaks reality.\n\nIn Singularity Wash has, as subject of the paradox, had his history rewritten and is left oscillating between the delusional state he was in prior to being shot and the sane man he was after his treatment. Wash\u2019s complaining about his non-existent neck wound to Doctor Grey inspired her to commit a massive insurance fraud against the UNSC, splitting the compensation between Wash and herself. Wash used the money to make nonsensical business deals, such as using cannons for funerals. Donut arrives and fixes Wash\u2019s oscillation, and explains Chrovos\u2019s plan. Washington suggests stopping the paradox, but Genkins steals the time travel gun.\n\nIn the flashbacks of Season 9 and 10, Washington is shown to be naive and neurotic, much like the Reds and Blues. However the encounter with Epsilon hardened him, making him a considerably more serious and skilled character throughout ''The Recollection''. Although Washington is not as skilled in combat as higher-ranked freelancers such as Carolina, he is nevertheless a formidable opponent in a fight, managing to take down a UNSC Hornet single-handedly, and battle against the likes of Tex, The Meta, and Locus.\n\n===Chorus War===\n====Locus====\nA mercenary associated with a band of Space Pirates, '''Locus''' ([[Gray Haddock]]), whose real name is revealed in Season 14 to be Samuel Ortez, was hired by Charon Industries to play off one of the sides in the Chorus Civil War, the Federal Army of Chorus. He is named after an eponymous suit of armor, and has a [[cloaking device]] that allows him to become invisible.\n\nLocus' introduction in season 11 had him spying on the Reds and Blues, and later killing the pilot that dropped off Doc, Donut, and Lopez. Once he sees Felix talking to the group, he decides to recruits soldiers to attack the crash site. In the ensuing battle, he personally incapacitates and captures Donut, Wash, Lopez, and Sarge. In the next season, New Republic leader Kimball reveals to Tucker that Felix and Locus were in fact friends and fought alongside each other, but the war changed them both so much they could not face returning to civilian life. Felix teamed up with the Chorus rebels and, out of rivalry, Locus joined the FAC to finally find out which one of them is the better. However, Felix's betrayal later in the season reveals the last part was a ruse: Locus and Felix were hired to play both sides of the Chorus war to wipe out the population for an organization (Control) that intends to use Chorus for their own purposes.\n\nDuring Season 13, a portal in a temple reveals a part of Locus' past: the squad in which he and Felix fought found an Alien, Locus refused to kill him, only take it prisoner, which led the commanding officer to yell at Locus, saying him that he was nothing more than a suit of armor and a gun who should follow orders without question. Traumatized by having his values shattered in front of him, Locus decides to become what his superior demanded, a living weapon that carried out all orders regardless of their consequences. Still, once Locus realizes he has become less a soldier than a monster, and discovers Felix was afraid of Locus himself, Locus refuse to aid Felix, leading to the latter's death. Locus vows to the Reds and Blues to amend his wrongs, but proclaims that he will not do it from a cell, while leaving them behind.\n\nIn Season 15, Locus who was making up for his past sins, Locus swore off killing and began seeking ways to use his skills to help others. Approximately ten months later, Locus discovered a refugee colony with their power generator stolen by the Blues and Reds resulting in their deaths. While looking for the terrorists he finds Lopez head floating in space heading to a black hole while asking for help. Locus joins up with Lopez and Grif to save the Reds and Blues. While Grif distracts the Blues and Reds, Locus saves Washington and Carolina. He then meets up with Sarge to free the rest of the group. After Wash is wounded, Locus takes him aboard his ship to receive medical attention on Chorus. During the next season, Locus tries to contact the Reds and Blues with an urgent message, but Grif, who wanted to avoid anything that could lead to further adventures, crashed the ship before learning what Locus wanted.\n\n====Felix====\n'''Felix''' (Miles Luna), real name Isaac Gates, first appears in [[Red vs. Blue: Season 11|Season 11]], observing the Blue Team and noticing that Locus is nearby. Felix saves Wash from being shot by Locus with a hardlight shield, but is himself hit in the leg. After Locus flees, Doc manages to heal Felix, who reveals he is a mercenary working with the New Republic that is fighting on the planet of Chorus, a planet forgotten about by the [[Factions of Halo|UNSC]] during the war against the aliens, and requires the help of the Reds and Blues. Although reluctant, the Reds and Blues eventually agree to help.\n\nDuring Season 12, Felix inspects the training Tucker, Simmons, Grif and Caboose provide to the New Republic troops, and reveals while a mercenary, his only payment is on alien technology he hopes to sell in the black market. Once he appears in the Federal Army's compound where the Reds and Blues reunited, Felix reveals himself to be a sadistic, manipulative [[psychopath]], who was working alongside Locus to keep prolonging the war on Chorus for an organization that intends to use Chorus for their own purposes. His intentions are revealed to the New Republic once Tucker records Felix gloating about his plans and broadcasts it to the troops that were fighting on the Chorus capital Armonia.\n\nIn Season 13, Felix and Locus decide to even the odds by raiding the UNSC ''Tartarus'', kill the crew members and \"recruit\" several of its prisoners, including the Counselor and Sharkface. After the Reds and Blues activate the planet's dormant alien technology, Felix learns about the Purge tower, that could kill everyone on Chorus. He goes for the Great Key that could activate the Purge, but Doyle beats him to it. Felix retrieves the Key, only to discover it will only work for Doyle until he dies, leading to an attack on Armonia that kills the General. Felix and Locus then head for the Purge tower, where Wash and Carolina waited. After a long and brutal fight, the Freelancers inform the two that they were simply stalling them, and then the ''Tartarus'' is brought down with a tractor beam into the tower, destroying it.\n\nEnraged, Felix flies himself and Locus to the Comm Temple in their damaged Falcon, furiously wanting to kill the Blood Gulch Crew. Locus eventually decides he had enough of Felix and refuses to aid him, leading Simmons and Tucker to blast Felix off the tower. Locus proceeds to pick up the discarded Key and activates the sword, proving the previous wielder was dead.\n\n====The Chairman====\n'''Chairman Malcolm Hargrove''' (Jack Lee), also known as '''Control''', is the head of Charon Industries, a company which specializes in military hardware. Hargrove is also the Chairman of the UNSC Oversight Sub-Committee  He is introduced in ''Reconstruction'' through messages exchanged between himself and Director Leonard Church, of Project Freelancer, with the Chairman suspecting him of criminal acts with his experiments, and eventually presses charges against the Director and sends officers to place him under arrest. He returns in ''Recreation'' to talk with Washington, striking a deal to free him in exchange for the Epsilon AI.\n\nIn the finale of season 12, the Reds and Blues acknowledge his true identity as the leader of the corporation financing the Chorus Civil War. He then receives a threat from them, after which we learn that he is in possession of the Meta's helmet. By the next season, it is further revealed that Charon is selling Alien technology on the black market, and once the Reds and Blues expose Hargrove's crimes is exposed, he arrives on Chorus, declaring if he is going down, then so will the inhabitants and the Space Pirates. Hargrove later confronts the Reds and Blues on a video screen aboard the ''Staff of Charon''. Season 15 reveals that Hargrove was defeated and arrested.\n\n====Sheila/F.I.L.S.S.====\n'''Sheila''' ([[Yomary Cruz]]) is one of the many copies of the '''F.I.L.S.S.''' (Freelancer Integrated Logistics and Security System, pronounced \"Phyllis\", and also voiced by Cruz) AI. In The Blood Gulch Chronicles Sheila appears primarily as the [[artificial intelligence|AI]] of the Blue Team's tank. In seasons 9-10, the original F.I.L.S.S. system is shown running training programs, security and databases. Unlike the Alpha, Sheila/F.I.L.S.S. is not a \"smart AI\", meaning that she was programmed rather than based on a person. She is usually friendly and cheerful but sometimes defensive.\n\nIn Season 1, Sheila is driven by Caboose, and accidentally kills his teammate, Church, due to a combination of [[Radar lock-on|locked-on]] targeting and disabled [[friendly fire]] protocol, before being herself \"killed\" after Sarge orders a bombing. Tex fixes Sheila and attacks Red Base, but is then, this becomes a running joke in the series. Sheila initially shows some indications of liking Caboose. However, in the middle of Season 2, she falls in love with Lopez, much to Caboose's dislike. Later, the two attempt to lead a robot revolution against the humans in response to the abuse they have received from constantly being blown up and possessed by ghosts. When Church goes \"back in time\", he attempts to stop himself from being killed. When he encounters Sheila she calls herself F.I.L.S.S. This confuses Church, she then asks if he would like her to change her name to Sheila, which she does. It is also revealed that the robot revolution idea stemmed from Church's attempt to intervene. After O'Malley kidnaps Lopez, she starts assisting the teams again.\n\nSheila remains behind on Blood Gulch while the Reds and Blues leave to pursue O'Malley through the teleporter. After a brief conversation with a \"[[time travel|time-travel]]ing\" Church, Sheila powers down. She is the source of the distress signal that the Reds hear in Season 3. A deleted scene from Season 4 confirms that she sent out the distress signal with a disguised voice. In addition, all of the Reds except Sarge see her drive past Red Base. When Sarge demotes Simmons for his talk about \"imaginary\" tanks, she helps Simmons attempt his revenge on the Reds, and is unable to recognize the team as her enemies due to faltering [[memory]] units. In a deleted scene from Season 4, she expresses dissatisfaction when Church collects all the vehicles available to the Blue Base in Blood Gulch, while Church perceives her reaction as jealousy.\n\nIn Season 5, Church notes that Sheila has been acting aggressive lately and saying \"random threatening things.\" They suspect that O'Malley could be possessing her and she is shut down. Tex explained that the tank was too damaged to be reactivated, so they transfer Sheila's AI into the ship that Sister had arrived in. She is pleasantly surprised by the roominess of her new home, and later tells Caboose that O'Malley has moved into the Blue leader (Captain Flowers). Her tank body is then taken over by the AI Gamma. Later they link the ship up to the tank and she locks Gamma behind a firewall.\n\nCaboose tells the other Blues in {{rvbep|54|Episode 54}} that Andy knew Sheila from a previous encounter. The Season 4 commentary states that Andy was originally to be Sheila's ex-boyfriend, but this idea was not used.<ref name=\"S4DVDComment\">Rooster Teeth Productions (2006). Audio commentary. In ''{{rvbep|season 4|Red vs. Blue Season Four}}'' [DVD]. Buda, Texas: Rooster Teeth Productions.</ref> Sheila is believed to be destroyed when Andy explodes inside the ship in the final episode of the ''Blood Gulch Chronicles''. However, it is revealed in ''Reconstruction'' that Sheila survived the explosion and is still present within the crashed ship. As a result of the explosion, she is damaged and functions at minimal capacity, stuttering when speaking. Later in ''Relocated'' Caboose is seen taking parts from the ship. In ''Revelation'' she occupies an abandoned Freelancer facility where the Reds and Blues travel. After constantly being called Sheila, she begins to respond to that name as well.\n\nIn Project Freelancer, F.I.L.S.S. assisted the Director on the flagship ''Mother of Invention'' and various other freelancer bases. She appears to be a close companion of the Freelancers as they greet her when they return from their missions. One subroutine becomes Sheila the tank. In ''Season 10'', in the present day, the same abandoned facility from earlier had become Director's hideout. There she spends her days constantly repeating a video of Allison. After Carolina and Church left the Director, he ordered F.I.L.S.S. to delete everything, including her, except the video. Before deletion, they both express the honor of serving each other.\n\nIn Season 12's finale, F.I.L.S.S. is shown to be functional and working for Chairman Hargrove, though sounding more depressed and reluctant in her duties. In the conclusion of Season 13, F.I.L.S.S is discovered by the Reds and Blues on the ship Staff of Charon, where she reveals she has been working under duress, and aids the Reds and Blues in their plot to expose Hargrove.\n\n====Sharkface====\n'''Sharkface''' (David Jennison) first appears in ''Season 9'', Chapter 13. In the following chapter, when the Freelancers attack a building, he is ordered to lead a squad up to the vault to kill the Freelancers. Carolina and Washington are about to leave the vault when the door is opened and the Flame Soldier appears. The two Freelancers, confused by his bold entrance, are forced to take cover as he begins to fire a flamethrower. After a tough fight, Carolina, jumps onto a Banshee suspended from the ceiling, tosses a grenade and kicks off it. The grenade explodes sending the Banshee flying into the Flame Soldier. To their surprise, the Flame Soldier takes the hit and begins to get up, but Carolina throws a Gravity Hammer at his head, rendering him unconscious.\n\nIn the first episode of Season 13, Sharkface is seen for a brief moment in a prison cell on a giant prison transport ship, the ''Tartarus''. Later in the episode, he is seen getting released and recruited by Felix and Locus, due to his past experience with the Freelancers. The Insurrection Flame Soldier, now known as Sharkface due to the tattoos of his old Insurrection personality and the left side of his face being covered by scar tissue, explains to the Counselor that they left him for dead, dropped a building on him, and killed all his friends. He is also seen spray painting his helmet and gun with the gun receiving the shark decal instead of his helmet. The Counselor has numerous therapeutic sessions with Sharkface where he vividly expressed his hatred of the Freelancers. He successfully defeats Carolina after Epsilon fails to maintain her armor upgrades and constantly butts heads with Felix. He puts himself on a warpath against Carolina and Wash which gets him killed. After being defeated by Carolina, he vowed that he will hunt Agents Carolina and Washington, no matter what they do to him. With that said, he is swiftly executed by Agent Washington and Vannessa Kimball. His corpse is destroyed as Doyle blows up Armonia.\n\n====The Counselor====\n'''Counselor Aiden Price''' (Asaf Ronen) was a high-ranking member of the Freelancer Project. The Counselor first appears in a flashback during Part 4 of ''Recovery One'', where he interrogates Agent Washington about the failure of the Epsilon AI and informs him he is a candidate for Recovery. His next appearance is in ''Reconstruction'', where he appears on a monitor and interrogates Pvt. Henderson before speaking to Agent Washington about The Meta. He also speaks briefly with Washington in Chapter 19 and attempts to negotiate with The Meta. He is also seen during a flashback in ''Recreation'' debriefing Donut after his transfer from Blood Gulch. He typically speaks in a very soft voice, and tries to calm those he is speaking to. The Counselor appears in the flashback portions of ''Season 9'' and ''Season 10'' where he frequently advises against some of the Director's more erratic actions, but is usually ignored, the Director even going so far as saying \"Shut up Counselor\".\n\nIn ''Prologue'' (the first episode of ''Season 13''), it is revealed the Counselor is being held on the UNSC prison ship ''Tartarus'' in transit for transport to an unknown facility. When the ship is raided by Felix and Locus, he offers his knowledge of the Freelancers project, showing bitterness to Agents Washington and Carolina. In episode 18 the Counselor is killed when the ''Tartarus'' crash lands on Chorus.\n\n====Kimball====\nVanessa Kimball ([[Lindsay Jones (actress)|Lindsay Jones]]) is the idealist leader of the Chorusian New Republic, who takes in Simmons, Grif, Tucker and Caboose after the Federal Army attacks the Reds and Blues. When Felix lies to her and tells her that the Reds and Blues were killed, he manages to convince Kimball to go to the capital Armonia with her soldiers. However, they end up trapped inside the capital by the Federal Army, only stopping once the Reds and Blues reveal Felix's confession of his true intentions and allegiance to Control, which even had him bragging about playing Kimball, to her disgust. Kimball and Doyle both order their troops to stand down.\nIn the next season, both continue to bicker regarding the way to lead the armies in their fight against Charon, until Doyle confesses he admires Vanessa's courage, and then the General's sacrifice inspires Kimball to convince the factions to solve their differences. She leads the attack on the Communication Temple that would allow the Reds and Blues to expose Charon to the universe.\n\nIn Season 15, Kimball is revealed to have become the president of a united Chorus, currently under siege by UNSC troops.\n\n==== Doyle====\nGeneral Donald Doyle ([[Gray Haddock]]) was the leader of the Federal Army of Chorus. Originally a secretary for a brigadier general, he became the FAC leader after previous leaders either left or died during the Chorus Civil War. He is shown to be extremely cowardly when it came to combat situations. Still, he decided to retrieve an energy sword that would allow the mercenaries to kill all of Chorus, and later sacrifices himself by manually attaching an explosive to Armonia's nuclear reactor in an attempt to kill all space pirates who had invaded the Chorus capital. In season 15 a memorial hospital was built and named General Doyle General Hospital.\n\n====The Lieutenants====\nOnce the New Republic decides to have Caboose, Grif, Simmons, and Tucker instruct their troops, they are named captains and given each a squad to lead. At a certain point, each has to promote one soldier to be their lieutenants in a rescue mission.\n\nFrom Caboose's Blue Team comes Lt. John Elizabeth Andersmith \"Smith\" (Ryan Haywood), a disciplined and blindingly loyal recruit, who believes that Caboose is an extremely wise and great leader, shocking the others. Smith's middle name is a reference to ''[[The Producers (1967 film)|The Producers]]''<ref>[http://milesluna.tumblr.com/post/98767808777/tvckingtons-i-really-wanna-know-if-that Miles Luna's Twitter]</ref> and the full surname, to a fake dead soldier in a lie told by the Blues in Season 9 to keep Tex in Blood Gulch.\n\nEven if the sycophanthic Matthews (Kyle Taylor) attempts to become the Orange Team's choice in the rescue mission, Grif promotes Lt. Antoine Bitters (Brandon Farmahini), who, like his superior, has a lazy and pessimistic attitude, who Grif likes for being a \"total maverick\".\n\nSimmons' Red Team only has women, something that bothers him. He chooses the one who makes him the less nervous, Lt. Katie Jensen ([[Barbara Dunkelman]]), who like Simmons is intellectual, loyal and socially awkward, going as far as choking in her own saliva when attempting to introduce herself. Jensen speaks with a heavy [[lisp]], which during RTX 2018 was revealed to be inspired by a character Dunkelman created in college, and in Season 13 turns out to be a dangerous driver who constantly destroys vehicles.\n\nAfter Tucker's Green Team is mostly killed in a mission, the only survivor is the one Tucker resents the most, and thus earns a promotion, Lt. Charles Palomo (Kerry Shawcross). Like Tucker, Palomo is immodest and perverted, although he manages to eventually gain the affection of Jensen, and by Season 15 both are dating.\n\n====Santa====\nSanta (Adam Ellis), named so by Caboose for [[Santa Claus|being red and \"bearing gifts\"]], is an alien AI construct who inhabits and guards the ancient temples of Chorus. He first appears when Tucker activates his sword before the Temple of Arms, knowing it was a key built by its creators that could activate the temples. Santa then deactivates the facility, and  proceeds to test anyone who entered the temples with illusions that show their greatest fears in search for \"a true warrior of  mental clarity and strength\", which turns out to be Caboose, who is not intimidated by Santa's ordeal. After Caboose exits, Santa introduces himself as an AI left behind to protect gifts from his creators, which range from alien weaponry to communications centers. At first he refuses to take part in the Chorus Civil War, but eventually backs the natives after realizing that the Space Pirates intend on selling the technology.\n\nIn Season 15, Santa is revealed to have become an assistant to President Kimball, checking on whoever visits her to see if they lie.\n\n==== Dr. Grey ====\nDr. Emily Grey (Arryn Zech) is a surgeon originally in the Federal Army of Chorus, who in spite of remarkable medical skills is mentally unstable, always talking in a cheerful manner even when discussing morbid subjects. Introduced recovering Washington following the battle that led to his capture, Grey is eventually transported along with the Blood Gulch Crew by getting caught in the radius of a Teleportation Cube utilized by Carolina. There, she treats Carolina's wound, and helps the group learn more about Locus and Felix's plans by interrogates a pirate who follows the group through torture and mutilation.\n\nA month later, as the civil war is changed to a fight between Chorus and Charon Industries, Dr. Grey goes with Epsilon and Carolina to gain more info on a nearby alien temple. She is present after Caboose manages to uncover the AI inside the temple, even ordering Freckles to kill the pirates who appear after the group, and as Doc is discovered in a cave. Upon their return to Armonia,  Grey quickly becomes interested in Doc's split personality and chases him around the city to perform [[electroshock therapy]] on him. Later on, the Space Pirates attack the city, forcing Grey to take refuge inside the hospital. As the pirates attack the hospital, Grey is luckily saved by Smith, Jensen, Palomo, and Bitters, who inform her that they are evacuating the city. Along with the lieutenants, she infiltrates Crash Site Alpha and activate the tractor beam that brings down the ''Tartarus'', destroying it and the Purge Temple on the impact.\n\nIn Season 15, Dr. Grey is revealed to be the head surgeon of General Doyle General Hospital, patching up Jax Jones and giving his boss Dylan Andrews the name of the UNSC diplomat that could help her arrange a meeting with Kimball. Grey also treats Washington's neck wound, and in the next season discusses the resulting injuries with Carolina, who had become worried by her partner's memory lapses.\n\n=== Blues And Reds ===\n==== Temple ====\n'''Mark Temple''' (Andrew Matthews) is Church's counterpart, and the leader of the Blues and Reds, the group attacking the UNSC. After his friend Biff (Mac Blake), a Grif equivalent, was accidentally killed during a capture the flag game featuring Carolina and Tex,  he swore revenge upon the UNSC and Project Freelancer. He started killing everyone involved in the project, with agents in particular being lured to a secret room where Temple locked them in their armor, a fate Temple bestows on Wash and Carolina while revealing his vendetta.\n\nUnlike Church, Temple is a caring, kind, and capable leader with much respect for others, but they are both terrible shots with the sniper rifle. In reality, Temple is a manipulative and sadistic individual more than willing to murder anyone who gets in his way, while Church was willing to sacrifice himself on numerous occasions (and actually ''has'', twice). Temple is revealed to have planned to use a specialized drill that runs on temporal power to destroy the UNSC headquarters, unaware that doing so would endanger the entire planet, and possibly the universe, due to breaking the laws of physics and possibly opening a tear in reality. When confronted by the Reds and Blues with this information, he stubbornly refuses to believe it, insisting that they simply wish to keep him from destroying the UNSC and achieving the vengeance he seeks for the death of his longtime friend Biff. Temple is knocked unconscious by Tucker, and is seen in a mid-credits scene imprisoned with the surviving Blues and Reds.\n\n==== Buckey ====\nBuckey (Dallas Reid) is Tucker's counterpart in the Blues and Reds. Much like Tucker, Buckey is extremely perverted, even having his own version of Tucker's \"Bow Chicka Bow Wow!\" catchphrase, \"Boom Chicka Wah Wah!\" After the Reds and Blues are captured, Buckey takes Tucker's sword, despite knowing it only works for Tucker. When the Reds and Blues try to stop Loco's machine, Buckey goes into a one-on-one battle with Tucker which end with Tucker knocking Buckey unconscious and recovering his sword. Buckey is seen in a mid-credits scene imprisoned with the surviving Blues and Reds.\n\n==== Loco ====\nLoco (Kirk Johnson) is Caboose's Blues and Reds counterpart, with a name alluding to [[locomotive]] to contrast the original being [[caboose|the last wagon]]. Loco is like Caboose in almost every way, even having the same intelligence. Loco also has a knack for engineering, according to Temple. He is also the only member of the Blues and Reds to actually like the Reds and Blues, forming a deep friendship with Caboose. Loco also creates a time machine/laser drill that will cause a black hole that will destroy Earth. After activating the machine, Loco gets Caboose batteries to fix Freckles, but is accidentally shot by Temple. Loco gives Caboose the batteries, before revealing that his machine will allow Caboose to say goodbye to Church. Loco then dies of his wounds. ''The Shisno Paradox'' reveals that he had gained the knowledge to build the time machine from Chrovos under unknown circumstances, as part of his plan to destroy the timeline.\n\n==== Surge ====\nColonel Surge ([[Kent Williams (voice actor)|Kent Williams]]) is Sarge's Blues and Reds counterpart. While they are similar in personality, they have a differing taste in weapons, with Surge preferring a [[railgun]] as opposed to a shotgun. During the Blues and Reds invasion of Earth, Surge is the most concerned with killing the Reds and Blues. After Loco's machine is activated, Surge and Sarge get into a one-on-one battle. Sarge tries to get Surge to turn against Temple, but accidentally causes Surge to fall into an incinerator.\n\n==== Gene ====\nGene (Sorola) is Simmons' Blues and Reds counterpart, named as in\u2013joke to [[Gene Simmons]]. Unlike the other Blues and Reds, Gene is identical to Simmons in every way, with even their voices being the same. After Loco activates his machine, Gene, now with a gold visor, attacks Grif and Simmons. Grif is at first unable to tell them apart, but gets Gene to reveal himself by asking the question \"Why are we here\" which Gene responses with (We need to stop these evil guys , that's why!) while Simmons response with (We don't know why we're here. It's still one of life's great mysteries, isn't it?) . Grif promptly shoots Gene, who stumble over a catwalk and is left hanging precariously over a lava flow.\n\n==== Cronut ====\nCronut (Luna) is Donut's counterpart, also named after [[cronut|a pastry]]. Like Donut, Cronut often nearly dies, and has a dislike of his armor being called pink, instead preferring \"reddish-white.\"  Cronut also frequently makes innuendos. When the Blues and Reds arrive on Earth, Cronut and Lorenzo are sent to kill the Reds and Blues in a tank. Tucker quickly decapitates Lorenzo, and causes the tank to explode with Cronut still inside. It's later revealed that Cronut managed to survive, and was imprisoned along with the other surviving Blues and Reds.\n\n==== Lorenzo ====\nLorenzo (Burns) is Lopez's counterpart, a robot that can only speak Italian. When the Blues and Reds arrive on Earth, Lorenzo and Cronut are sent in a tank to kill them. Tucker jumps on the tank and decapitates Lorenzo, who was serving as the gunner, and kicks his head into the distance vowing vendetta . Lorenzo's body is destroyed when the tank explodes.\n\n====Doc====\n[[Combat medic|Medical]] Officer Frank \"Doc\" Dufresne ([[Matt Hullum]]), nicknamed as such because Church could not pronounce his surname, is a [[medic]] first sent to Blood Gulch to treat both armies, despite the lack of medical skill that he often displays. He is not a qualified doctor, having failed [[medical school]] at Jamaica State, and his lack of medical knowledge is apparent. In one case he rubs Caboose's neck with [[aloe|aloe vera]] to treat a bullet wound in the foot, and he agrees with Grif's using [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] to treat the bullet wound to the head. He also has no idea what his medical tool (portrayed by ''Halo'''s Plasma Pistol) does.\n\nDoc is also a [[pacifism|pacifist]] of the most extreme kind, and tries to avoid doing or even saying anything that would seem remotely aggressive or competitive. As revealed in the bonus material on the Season 3 DVD, this pacifism had caused him to be released from the Red Army before the events of ''The Blood Gulch Chronicles'', thereby necessitating the draft that forced Grif into military service. The profile also states he is the only person in history to enlist in an army as a 'conscientious objector'.<ref name=\"S3DVDProfiles\" /> Doc's incompetence drew the ire of both teams, leading him to hide in a cave. There O'Malley found Doc and possessed him, and the personality clashes \u2013 the aggressive megalomaniac AI against the meek apologetic host \u2013 lead to frequent arguments between O'Malley and Doc. After going into hiding following O'Malley's defeat at the end of Season 3, Doc returns in {{rvbep|73}} because Church needed a medical assessment of Tucker. In Episode 77, O'Malley leaves Doc after the Reds, unaware of his presence, contact Command via radio. Free of O'Malley, Doc continues to aid Tucker, who was in fact pregnant with an alien, and hang along with the Blues,  providing Sister with a physical and later being held captive along with her by O'Malley's new host Captain Flowers.\n\nIn ''Reconstruction'', Doc only had a cameo in the Sponsor Cut of an episode, where he was called to assist a comatose Caboose, but Washington's team had already departed before Doc arrived. Doc is next seen in ''Revelation'' when Simmons, as Washington's prisoner, calls for a medic. Command sends the nearest one, Doc, who is soon attacked by Washington and also taken prisoner, being ordered to check The Meta's vitals. In the finale of ''Revelation'', Doc helps treat Washington after the battle, and manages to escape with the Red and Blue teams.\n\nIn ''Season 10'' it is revealed that Doc eventually returned to Valhalla, where he revived Donut. After Church and Carolina leave to kill the Director, the others are left at the base when Doc talks about how close they have all become and the group is encouraged to go find Church and Carolina. Doc, who is excited they are going on another adventure, goes to pack medical equipment for the trip. He is then left behind by the Reds and Blues who leave in Hornets. However, Doc returns in ''Season 11'', along with Donut and Lopez. He assists Grif with researching the teleportation grenades found on the crashed ship. When the two present their findings to Sarge, Grif accidentally throws one at Doc and he disappears. Doc is not seen for the rest of the season, and only Lopez seems to notice his disappearance.\n\nOnly in the 13th season Doc made his return, stating that after Grif threw a \"Future Cube\" at him, he entered a sort of \"other dimension\" until emerging in the cave where Caboose, Dr. Grey, and Tucker found him. When Doc discovered that no one noticed his disappearance, an angry split personality based on O'Malley emerged and violently beat Tucker, until Dr. Grey knocked him out. Doc, manifesting this O'Malley persona, fights alongside the Reds and Blues during the final battle against Hargrove's forces.\n\nDoc returns in ''Season 15'', revealing himself as an old acquaintance of the Blues and Reds before he met the Blood Gulch troopers. Doc defects to the Blues and Reds, due to the Reds and Blues treating him poorly, but changes his mind upon realizing Temple's plan, leading Doc to be imprisoned, and then freed by Tucker. In ''The Shisno Paradox'' Doc's betrayal earns him the scorn of Grif, even if Donut's introduction of a time travel adventure has both paired. Doc tries to convince Grif of using time travel to save lives, but Grif only thinks of pizza, even traveling back to ancient [[Italy]] trying to teach the natives to make it once the dish turns out to no longer exist in the present. Doc admits he became a medic because of his failure to save his brother, but Grif passes out. When he wakes up, Grif gives Doc the time machine, saying that pizza can wait. Huggins suddenly warns Grif not to do it, and Doc reveals he is under the control of his O'Malley personality,before stranding Huggins and Grif in the past. Doc/O'Malley is later commanded to kill Donut for betraying Chrovos, resulting in a battle though time that ended in 21st century Chicago which he ended up getting blown off a building with a grenade.\n\nIn season 17 it\u2019s revealed by Donut that he died from the fall, though this is later revealed as untrue when Doc regains his memories in the Everwhen. Doc regains control of his body once more, and escapes being trapped in the Labyrinth by Genkins. Doc arrives at the Labyrinth\u2019s entrance, offering to help Chrovos and Donut. Doc, while trying to free Washington, is confronted by a manifestation of his O\u2019Malley personality. Doc merges with the O'Malley personality with him, rescuing Washington.\n\nDoc was originally envisioned as a journalist-type character but was changed to a medic when a war journalist was deemed \"too close\" to the then ongoing [[War in Iraq]].<ref name=\"InverseArticle\">{{cite web|last1=Francisco|first1=Eric|title=How 'Red vs. Blue' Built an Empire and Invented a Whole Genre|url=https://www.inverse.com/article/29928-red-vs-blue-rooster-teeth-season-15-interview|publisher=Inverse|accessdate=12 April 2017}}</ref> The original plan for Doc's character, as noted by the Rooster Teeth crew, was simply to provide a vessel for O'Malley to jump into, and also to display his pacifism. Matt Hullum notes going through several different accents for the character, such as Cockney, French and Australian, before settling on his own voice to use, as he was unsure which direction to take the character.<ref name=\"S2DVD\"/>\n\n=== Cosmic Powers ===\n==== Atlus Arcadium Rex ====\nAtlus Arcadium Rex is the leader of the Cosmic Powers.\n\n==== Genkins ====\nGenkins ([[Ricco Fajardo]]) is one of the Cosmic Powers, a group of A.I. disguised as a pantheon of gods that were created by Chrovos. Genkins is a trickster, known for cracking jokes and lying and is almost always seen with a golf club, that Atlus later gives to Caboose, something that leaves Genkins distraught. Along with the rest of the Cosmic Powers, Genkins had overthrown Chrovos and trapped him. Genkins later grows bored with pretending to be a God and desires to be one for real. To this end, he allies with Chrovos who promised him with such power if he aided him in causing the Reds and Blues to destroy the timeline. Genkins helps deteriorate Wash\u2019s mental state, erases pizza from existence, and murders Huggins to prevent her form stopping the Reds and Blues from destroying the timeline.\n\nWhen the paradox takes effect, Genkins possesses Church in the alternate timeline most of the Reds and Blues are trapped in, and tries to lead them to create more paradoxes to free Chrovos. Genkins jumps across the timeline as well, creating more paradoxes. Despite Genkins\u2019 efforts to stop Washington and Donut from rescuing the Reds and Blues from the Everwhen, they succeed; Genkins is promptly attacked and beaten up by Caboose for possessing Church.\n\nGenkins then attempts to stop the Reds and Blues from fixing the timeline, only to fail consistently. Donut convinces Genkins that Chrovos will betray and abandon him, leading to Genkins betraying Chrovos and stealing most of her power. With this new power, Genkins strips the Reds and Blues of their ability to time travel. When the Reds and Blues use the time portals to impale Genkins with his own golf club (which had been taken by Caboose), Genkins traps them in the Labyrinth. When Doc and Donut free them, Genkins is briefly trapped in the Labrynth, though he quickly escapes. Genkins snaps and goes insane, deciding to use a black hole to travel back to the beginning of time and become a god. Successfully doing so, Genkins is revealed to be Chrovos; Chrovos had forgotten her origin as Genkins. The Reds and Blues then instruct Huggins to inform the Cosmic Powers about Genkins\u2019s treachery and to trap him alongside his future self.\n\n==== Chrovos ====\nChrovos is a primordial being who existed when the universe was created with the power to control time . He is the main antagonist of Red vs Blue season 16 & 17 while also a Catalyst behind the events of season 15 .\n\n==== Kalirama the Undying ====\n==== Huggins ====\nHuggins is a sentient Light Being that appeared in season 16. She, alongside her brother Muggins, were affiliated with the Cosmic Powers and were tasked to keep an eye on the Reds and Blues. After the simulation troopers escaped from Kalirama by a time portal, she followed Grif and Doc into sixth-century Italy and failed to stop him from giving Doc the gun, not knowing he was taken over by his other personality. She later joined Grif to find Sister, who was in England with Tucker and slowly became friends.\n\nAfter the Reds and Blues met the Cosmic Powers she was ordered to watch over them and finds out that they are choosing to disobey the Cosmic Powers' request and travel back in time and stop Wash from getting shot. Outraged and feeling betrayed by Grif, Huggins rushes off to warn the Cosmic Powers about their betrayal but Genkins stops her by summoning a black hole that sucks her inside killing her. In season 17 it is revealed she survived the black hole and ended nearby a Red sun like object.\n\n==== Muggins ====\nMuggins is a sentient Light Being that is affiliated to the Cosmic Powers who first appeared in season 16. He is also the brother of Huggins.\n\n==== Labyrinth ====\nLabyrinth was an AI designed to make illusions to anyone that was brought there (specifically for people trying to free Chrovos. Except of course, \"The chosen one\") But Genkins lied to Labyrinth by telling him the Reds and Blues were trying to free Chrovos.\n\nDonut and Doc went in to try to free the Reds and Blues. In Washington's Room, O'Malley tried to get Doc to let him out. Instead, Doc decided to break his oath. In Carolina's Room, it was revealed that Carolina's fear was her old self. When Carolina defeated her fear, Labyrinth revealed himself and Donut tried to tell him Genkins was trying to break Chrovos free. When Genkins came in, Labyrinth was holding his Golf Club. Genkins them kicked him off of the edge into the Black Hole. When Genkins falls into the Black Hole, Labyrinth was actually alive.\n\n==== Burnstorm ====\n\n==Inactive and guest characters==\n===Red Team===\n====Warthog====\nThe '''M12 Light Reconnaissance Vehicle''',  codename '''Warthog''' (the vehicle's actual name in the [[Halo (video game series)|''Halo'' video game series]]) is a battle jeep frequently used by the Red Team. The first one is delivered in {{rvbep|2|Episode 2}}, where failing to see much resemblance to a [[warthog]], Grif suggests the name [[Cougar|Puma]]. Believing that Grif is suggesting the name of a mythical creature, Sarge mockingly suggests several other mythical creatures \u2014 such as [[Bigfoot]], [[unicorn]], [[leprechaun]], and \"Chupathingy\" (after the [[Chupacabra]]) \u2014 as names. ''Chupathingy'' is the name listed on the character biography, available as an [[Easter egg (virtual)|Easter egg]] for the {{rvbep|season 3}} DVD. In {{rvbep|29|Episode 29}}, Grif notes that the warthog seems to be \"really bad luck.\" During the first two seasons, it spends most of its time out of commission, or being repaired by Lopez. The warthog is frequently blaring loud [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[ranchera]] music, most likely set by Lopez, and it can often be heard approaching because of it. Throughout the show, multiple Warthogs are used, destroyed and repaired. They almost always play the same ranchera music.\n\nThe original warthog had a homing beacon and remote control system linked to Lopez. This system is accidentally activated in {{rvbep|Season 2}} when Church, then possessing Lopez, and Tucker attempt to activate Lopez's repair sequence. It was during this period that the warthog spoke, voiced by Burnie Burns. Burns suggests that, like Sheila, the vehicle was originally going to be a full-blown character and maintain a personality throughout the series, in a [[parody]] of ''[[Speed Buggy]]''. However, this idea was abandoned shortly after the remote control gag.<ref name=\"S2DVD\">Rooster Teeth Productions (2004). Audio commentary. In ''{{rvbep|season 2|Red vs. Blue Season Two}}'' [DVD]. Buda, Texas: Rooster Teeth Productions.</ref>\n\n====Lopez 2.0====\nIn ''Season 11'', Sarge decides to build a robot to fix the communications dish for the Reds and Blues. Upon completion, the robot coincidentally looks and speaks Spanish like Lopez, much to the chagrin of Grif and Simmons. The robot was named  Lopez 2.0 but more commonly referred to as Dos.0 (Shannon McCormick), which due to misunderstandings leads the Reds to think that the robot is stupid, even though Dos.0 was able to fix the radio transmitter. Dos.0 is initially very loyal and respectful until he meets Lopez, who tells the newer machine all of the bad things about the teams and how conversing with the Red Team will lead the members to make up entire conversations, regardless of the content, allowing for the Lopezes to insult them endlessly. Later, Sarge assigns Dos.0 and Lopez to repair the Cyclops robot (voiced by Katie Newville) that the Reds found on the crashed ship knowing that if they activate the robot it will kill everyone calling Sarge insane. Lopez suggests that they upload Lopez into the robot so that the two can gain respect from the others. However, Dos.0 betrays Lopez and the Reds by uploading himself into the Cyclops to attack the simulation soldiers and kill them. Dos.0 later battled Freckles while telling him that could have ruled the Reds and Blues as their Robot Overlords instead of being a pet to Caboose. Freckles was nearly destroyed by Dos.0 but got distracted and tricked by Donut allowing him to uses a transporter grenade to teleport the Cyclops over a minefield killing him. Lopez in turn takes Dos.0's body and mocks him, even calling him \"a jerk\" once the destroyed Cyclops body is found in the crash site the following season.\n\n====Francisco Montegue Zanzibar & Robot Number 2====\nFrancisco and Robot Number 2 were two Robots that we\u2019re created by Sarge to be host body\u2019s for Church and Agent Texas. Francisco was later possessed by Tex, and thereafter appeared to lose any and all self-sustainability. Robot Number 2 was later possessed by Church losing all self-sustainability. Unlike Francisco Robot Number 2 had a function to punch Grif in the head upon hearing the codeword, \"Dirtbag\".\n\n===Sarge's Elite Team===\n====Private John====\nPrivate John was a man based on John Wayne the actor who was recruited by Sarge and Simmons in the Shisno Paradox to kill Mark Temple of the Blues and Reds by travelling though time alongside George and Alex. After accidentally killing an actor playing Temple he joins Jax to help create his Red vs Blue movie based on the events of Season 15 he later got a audition to play Temple in the movie and was later playing Sarge.\n\n====Private George====\nPrivate George is a historical figure based on the first President of the United States George Washington who was recruited by Sarge and Simmons in the Shisno Paradox to kill Mark Temple of the Blues and Reds alongside John and Alex. After accidentally killing the actor playing Temple in the Red vs Blue movie being made by Jax he became his assistant director.\n\n====Private Alex====\nPrivate Alex was a historical figure based on the king of Macedonia Alexander the Great he was recruited by Sarge and Simmons in the Shisno Paradox to kill Mark temple of the Blues and Reds however Sarge didn\u2019t know that he encountered Caboose who accidentally sneezed on him giving him the Common Cold. Because of this, he constantly collapses due to the sickness and ultimately dies due to his immune system not being strong enough to battle the time period's modern diseases.\n\n===Blue Team===\n====Junior====\n'''Blarggity Blarg-Tucker'''<ref name=\"S5DVDProfiles\">[[Rooster Teeth Productions]] (2007). Character profiles. In ''{{rvbep|season 5|Red vs. Blue Season Five}}'' [DVD]. [[Buda, Texas]]: Rooster Teeth Productions.</ref> (Jason Salda\u00f1a)<ref name=\"S4DVDComment\"/> commonly known as '''Junior''' is the result of the Alien supposedly impregnating Tucker, with a [[parasitic embryo]]. In {{rvbep|77|Episode 77}}, his voice is first heard. In Season 5, he causes havoc in the Blue Base and Doc feeds him with some of Caboose's blood off-screen. Junior first appears in Episode 80, and is a mini-version of the Alien, with cyan and blue armor. Its existence frustrates Church who threatens to kill it multiple times. In Episode 84, the creature is introduced to Tucker, its \"father\". Tucker slowly becomes accustomed to this role, even snapping back at Church when he refers to it in a flippant manner. In Episode 91, Tucker is heard to call him Junior, and in Episode 94, Junior mimics Tucker's catch phrase by saying \"blarg chicka honk honk\". Later on, Junior is sent through the caves with Doc and Sister, where he is found by Captain Butch Flowers, who at the time was possessed by O'Malley. According to Episode 97, Junior is part of \"The great prophecy\" and is to be the savior of the Alien. The villains, however, intend to use him to control the Aliens. It is later implied that the whole prophecy was largely fictitious.\n\nJunior was taken onto the ship that Tex used to blast off from Blood Gulch, which exploded. However, the ship was later found crashed in Valhalla with no sign of either Junior or anyone else on board. The footage found on the Pelican implies that the Other Alien escaped with Junior before the Pelican crashed. In ''Recreation'', however, Tucker mentions that Junior is with him and together they act as ambassadors between the humans and Aliens. Despite this, Junior does not make an appearance.\n\nJunior would make an appearance in a photograph carried by Tucker in Season 13 where Junior is posing with his 5th grade Basketball team and also appears in Season 13, Episode 19 in the Sangheili Embassy watching Epsilon's message. In Season 15, Tucker reveals Junior entered college with a basketball scholarship.\n\nRooster Teeth released a video detailing how Junior was filmed at such a small size, later included on the Season 5 DVD, revealing they used [[forced perspective]], placing Junior, whose model is far bigger than the human ones, farther from the camera while hiding the characters' feet.<ref>{{subscription required}} {{cite news |url=http://achievementhunter.roosterteeth.com/episode/theater-mode-2017-episode-25-zombie-croc |title=Theater Mode: Episode #25: Zombie Croc |author=Achievement Hunter |publisher=[[Rooster Teeth]] |date=January 20, 2017 |access-date=January 22, 2017 |time=1:35:07 |quote=Forced perspective [...] That's how we made Junior in RvB}}</ref>\n\n====Jimmy====\nPrivate Jimmy (Cole Gallian real self) (John Ferrell False Memory) was a Blue Team Simulation Trooper who was chosen to be the original host body of the Alpha. Not much was known of his past except that he had a girlfriend back home and that he was brought to Sidewinder by Captain Flowers who tells him that he is the 'final piece of a very complex puzzle,' and that the future would see him as the unsung hero of their story. To his horror he was restrained and violently implanted with the Alpha. Jimmy was later killed in the first season of Red vs Blue by Caboose.\n\nWhen Church was using Jimmy's body, some of his memories merged with the Alphas creating a false backstory which made Church believe that Jimmy who had a southern accent was an old squad mate and that he was killed by Tex by beating him to death with their own skull.\n\n===Project Freelancer===\n<!-- FAIR USE of Rvb Project Freelancer.jpg.jpg: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Rvb Project Freelancer.jpg.jpg for rationale -->\n[[File:Rvb Project Freelancer.jpg|thumb|300px|Project Freelancer, from left to right: The Counselor, Four Seven Niner, Maine, North, South, Carolina, York, Wash, C.T., Wyoming, Florida, the Director and Tex.]]\n\n====The Director====\n'''Director Leonard  Church'''  (John Marshall Reed) is the head of Project Freelancer, and is responsible for most of the scenarios that the Red and Blue armies encounter. He and the Chairman of the Oversight Subcommittee are heard in the introductions of the ''Reconstruction'' chapters, alternating in a series of messages. He apparently uses both armies as test subjects for his experiments. His own forces wear white armor and run the Command Center that the armies call for missions. Throughout ''Reconstruction'', he was suspected by the Chairman of wrongdoing with his experiments and underwent a criminal investigation for his misuse of military property and the Alpha AI, leading to a warrant for his arrest. In the epilogue, it was revealed that the Director is the original Leonard Church, and the AI Church was based on his own mind. He is haunted by memories of Allison, a woman he loved who died many years ago, and that he inadvertently implanted his memories of her into another AI, Beta, which became Tex.\n\nThe Director is shown in person during the flashbacks in ''Season 9'' and ''Season 10''. However, his face is almost always obscured, and he wears a pair of glasses. The Director is shown to be a very strict and unforgiving commander, who is quick to punish failure and deliberately seeds rivalry among the Freelancers. He also shows a lack of concern for the safety of his soldiers, often caring more about the experimental equipment they are using rather than their lives. This attitude and his actions have caused many of the Freelancers, such as Tex, Washington, Carolina, and C.T., to utterly despise him.\n\nIn ''Season 10'', he creates an army of Tex clones, each one an attempt to recreate Allison. When Church and Carolina confront him, he is seen viewing Alison's last video on repeat. Upon confrontation, he surrenders and requests Carolina to leave her pistol before proceeding to shut down the facility. It is also revealed that he has the same green eyes as Carolina and he states \"You were my greatest creation\" as she is leaving, implying that Carolina is his daughter.\n\n====Vic====\n'''Vic''' (introduced voiced by Randall Glass; voiced by Burnie Burns from Season 2 onwards), short for Virtual Intelligent Computer v20, is an AI responsible for overseeing the operations on Blood Gulch, whose terminal is located in a cave below the canyon. He takes the personality of a sardonic and frequently unhelpful communications officer. Unknown to either team, he serves as a contact for both the Blue and Red Teams. Vic behaves like an annoying, ineffective [[technical support]] guy, constantly calling people \"dude\" and often offering obtuse and unhelpful advice and biting insults. Burnie Burns notes that Vic was portrayed as over-the-top annoying from Episode 20 so the character would be memorable to viewers.<ref name=\"S2DVD\"/> Burns based the voice on an eponymous former roommate, who lived with him for a year after Matt Hullum left for Los Angeles following their graduation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://roosterteeth.com/episode/rt-podcast-2016-greg-miller-mr-hard-nips-2016-389 |title=Rooster Teeth Podcast #389 |accessdate=October 19, 2016 |publisher=[[Rooster Teeth]]}}</ref> During Seasons 4 and 5, where the Reds and Blues had believed to have time travelled to the future, Vic called himself '''Vic Jr.''', which Burnie Burns noted was deliberately left unexplained, as the crew felt that sufficient information had been given already for fans to draw their own conclusions. Based on information discovered later, it is implied that Vic and Vic Jr. are the same, and Vic simply pretended he was his own descendant to fool the Red and Blue teams into thinking they were in the future.<ref name=\"S5DVDComm\" />\n\nIn Season 14, Vic gives introductory narration to most episodes, and is featured in one himself, where it is revealed that Vic was originally a far more disciplined and efficient AI programmed by Agent Florida to keep watch over the Blood Gulch simulation. After Florida accidentally tripped a cable, however, Vic malfunctioned and degraded to the persona he displayed in the Blood Gulch Chronicles while also affecting the list of replacement recruits that were originally suppose to arrive in Blood Gulch replacing agents California, Hawaii and Kansas to Caboose, Donut and Kaikaina Grif.\n\nIn Season 15, Vic has started to fail from operating so long, becoming suicidal. Dylan takes Vic as a helper A.I. in exchange for killing Vic when he gives her \"three wishes\". After Loco's time machine is activated, it begins to grow unstable. Dylan has Vic try to shut it off for her third wish, though Vic deletes himself to stabilize the machine. Vic leaves behind a recording parodying Epsilon's speech at the end of ''Season 13'', culminating in him threatening to, if anyone made a backup of him, he will \"punch them in the nuts\".\n\n====Four Seven Niner====\nFour Seven Niner real name Ash ([[Lee Eddy]]) is a pilot working with Project Freelancer, . She first appears in the trailer for ''Season 9'', flying a Pelican, trying to get the injured Maine to treatment. The medical station \"''Angel On My Shoulder''\", repeatedly denies her clearance to dock and tells her to throttle down, but she is persistent and is eventually allowed to proceed at the request of the Director. \nThroughout Seasons 9 and 10, Four Seven Niner escorts the Freelancers on numerous missions and performs multiple extractions. She also appears in an episode of Season 14 and 15 apiece flying Freelancers to missions.\n\nFour Seven Niner is shown to be sarcastic and free-thinking. When Carolina remarks that she is late for extraction, she responds by saying Carolina could take it out of her tip. In their proceeding escape on the Pelican, she responds to Agent South's complaints by sealing the pilot door in her face. She also despises AI, believing that they use their superior abilities to steal jobs from humans. However, she is quick to accept Delta when he admits that he does not know how to fly a Pelican.\n\nIn the mini-series \"Recovery One\" and season 6 ''Reconstruction'', Four Seven Niner is the voice on the other end of Washington's and South's radios, relaying their orders.\n\n===Freelancer Agents===\nThe soldiers, mostly called Freelancers, are highly trained elite special ops soldiers for Project Freelancer, and are sent on the most dangerous missions. Their call-signs are based on the fifty states of America.\n\n====Tex====\nFreelancer Agent '''Texas''', also known as '''Tex''' or Beta, real name Allison, is voiced by [[Burnie Burns]] in her initial appearance and her Season 15 cameo, and Kathleen Zuelch thereafter. Of the eight main characters, Tex was the last to appear, not debuting until {{rvbep|10|Episode 10}}. Though she is associated with the Blue Team, she is not an official member, but rather a mercenary \"paid\" to help them. Her back story with Project Freelancer and previous affiliation with fellow Blue Team member Church are key elements in the plot. With her [[special forces|Special Operations]] training, she is the most lethal member of the ''Blood Gulch'' cast, and especially so while she is still implanted with the Omega AI.\n\nDespite her skill, she has a tendency to fall short in her objectives, which Epsilon reveals to be part of the process that created her: when the Director made the Alpha out of his mind, the \"Beta\" AI emerged from the memories of his deceased wife Allison, an accomplished soldier who died in battle. Because all the Director could remember of Allison was her failing to return alive, Tex is always doomed to fail just as victory is in her grasp. In Season 1 alone Tex is easily captured by Sarge after beating up three Reds and retrieving the Blue flag, and ends up killed by Donut while attacking Red Base with a tank.\n\nAt first, Tex was intent on destroying her AI, Omega\\O'Malley, knowing it had evil intentions. However, by the end of Season 5, O'Malley convinces Tex to join him as both could use Junior to end the war that led to the creation of Project Freelancer. Tex escapes in a ship at the end of ''Blood Gulch Chronicles'', with Andy, Sheila, Gamma, and Omega. After Andy detonates, this ship crashes in ''Reconstruction'' and The Meta steals her as well as Gamma and Omega. Tex is later deleted in the EMP blast set by Washington. She briefly reappeared in the trailer of ''Recreation'' along with Church, as a narrator, but does not appear in the series proper.\n\nIn ''Revelation'', Epsilon-Church comes across a new robot body made for Tex in an abandoned facility and uses his memories to recreate Tex, a version referred to as \"Epsilon-Tex\" and with much adeptness in hand-to-hand combat, as her debut has her mercilessly and repeatedly pummeling Sarge, Simmons, Grif and Tucker. Later Epsilon-Tex sets up a trap for Wash and the Meta, and the latter ends capturing her and using Beta to power his armor. After the Meta dies, Epsilon enters the capture unit to find Tex. Once she is found in a recreation of Blood Gulch, Epsilon-Church in the capture unit, Epsilon finally lets her go by saying \"I forget you\", not wishing to let her live a life of never ending failures.\n\nIn ''Season 9'' in the past storyline, she joins Project Freelancer as a Master Captain, but shortly rises through the Freelancer ranks and takes the top spot over Carolina, which created a rivalry. Carolina was especially affected by the fact that she could never seem to beat Tex, who in turn did not show much animosity for Carolina.\n\nIn ''Season 10'', Church and Carolina return to the facility looking to kill the Director, when it was revealed that the Director had kept trying to recreate Tex and instead had created dozens of angered Tex copies, which only shut down as Epsilon talks to the Tex AI powering the drones and asks her to rest. Afterwards, the Director is revealed to be Carolina's father, showing that Tex's begrudging respect for Carolina comes from how she was based on the agent's mother.\n\nIn ''Season 13'', a vision of Tex is seen as part of Carolina's worst fears. Epsilon-Tex's helmet is also seen in Hargrove's trophy room.\n\nIn ''Season 15''  it is revealed that during one test involving simulation troopers, Tex led the Reds to take the Blue flag, eventually battling Carolina who was leading the Blues, killing Biff and accidentally beginning Temple's quest for vengeance.\n\n====Wyoming====\n'''Wyoming''', true name Reginald (Matt Hullum), is a ruthless [[mercenary]] with a [[British accent]]\u2014his character profile on the DVDs states his place of birth as \"somewhere British\"<ref name=\"S4DVDProfiles\" /> \u2014 introduced in the series when O'Malley hires him to kill Tucker. Wyoming has a habit of giving an insincere \"sorry\" to his victims just prior to killing them,<ref name=\"Wyoming\">{{rvbep|43|Episode 43}}, {{rvbep|52}}, {{rvbep|71}}.</ref> but, in one instance, retracts this apology when Tex complains to him that he destroyed her alien ship.<ref name=\"Ep71\">{{rvbep|71|Episode 71}}.</ref> He also is never shown getting agitated, showing no signs of annoyance when he cannot spot his target during an assassination. Wyoming is fond of knock-knock jokes, a trait he passed on to his AI Gamma.\n\nWyoming has an armor enhancement, the time distortion unit, which he uses to continually [[time loop|loop a particular stretch of time]] in order to modify events in his favor. His use of the time looping is discovered by Tucker, who eventually lulls Wyoming into complacency and stabs him with a sword early in the loop, killing him. However, he and Church quickly discovered that, several copies of Wyoming were created as a result of the loop. In the resulting chaos the Reds attacked the Wyomings, leaving only one alive. The final Wyoming is then dispatched by Tex. Tex then uses Wyoming's helmet to obtain coordinates for the ship in which she later escapes, but ends up being blown. In ''Reconstruction'', it is implied that once the bomb exploded, the time distortion was activated, with the ensuing [[time dilation]] leading the ship to take nearly a year to crash land in Outpost-17B (Valhalla). Wyoming's armor enhancement was then taken by The Meta.\n\nIn the ''Season 9'' flashbacks he is shown fighting Tex along with Maine and York in a training session where the three are beaten repeatedly by Tex. In the last round of eight, all of which Tex won, he and Maine use live ammo, Wyoming even manages to hit her during the fight, but they are still beaten. He is depicted without his helmet in Chapter 6 of ''Season 10'', revealing he has black hair and a handlebar mustache. Wyoming is depicted as a sniper and has a careful style of attack. He is implied to be the first one attacked by a crazed Maine, however he manages to evade death and the removal of his AI.\n\nThe auditions for Wyoming are described by the cast as \"terrible\", almost every cast member auditioned for the role doing various accents-for example, Joel Heyman performed a [[Cockney]] accent, Burnie Burns an Australian accent-and eventually Matt Hullum's British accent, considered the only acceptable one.<ref name=\"S3DVDComment\">Rooster Teeth Productions (2005). Audio commentary. In ''Red vs. Blue: Season Three'' [DVD]. Buda, Texas: Rooster Teeth Productions.</ref>\n\n====York====\nAgent New York, referred to as '''York''' (Sean Duggan), is another member of the AI experimental program. York is an infiltration specialist who seems to have become unemployed since the program closed down. His left eye was severely injured in a grenade explosion during a 3 on 1 brawl against Tex, with Wyoming and Maine. Despite his armor's healing unit, his eye did not heal, nor did it later save his life.\n\nHe is found by Tex during Part 3 of the miniseries ''Out of Mind'', trying to break into a store. It is revealed that he still had Delta. Here he accepts Tex's proposal of infiltrating Omega's base. At the end of ''Out of Mind'', he and Tex attempt a raid on Omega's base. The two are caught in a firefight against Wyoming and two of his minions. As the two scramble for cover, York is shot twice in the chest by Wyoming, and Delta reports that the bullets were fatal. The AI stays with York and manages to trick Wyoming with a hologram of Tex. Delta chooses to stay with York until his death, rather than go with Tex, appearing to perish with him as the armor shuts down. The healing unit in his armor would later be retrieved, along with Delta, by Washington.\n\nHe appears in the trailer for ''Season 9'', where he removes his helmet, revealing the broken eye, and brown/red hair. This marks him as the third character aside from Vic/Vic Jr, North, South. to have his face fully revealed. In ''Season 9'', the origin of his eye wound is revealed. During the paintball fight with Tex, a live grenade meant for Tex is detonated next to him. He is also shown to have some kind of relationship with Carolina, who inquires about his eye when he returns from the hospital. York is shown to have a sarcastic personality. For example, while attempting to organize his team against Tex in the training mission, he makes several sarcastic remarks when his suggestions are ignored. He is also the first Freelancer to officially receive an AI.\n\nIt was revealed that he met Carolina at a club, where she takes his lighter from him. During the raid on the ''Mother Of Invention'' where Texas attempted to retrieve the Alpha AI York sided with her, telling Carolina that he was 'doing the right thing', after having been told by his AI Delta of Alpha's torture. When facing Carolina York seemed hesitant to fight her and was quickly defeated by her while battling hand-to-hand in a zero gravity environment. Before leaving Carolina threw her cigarette lighter to York, something which brought York great sadness since he understood that she didn't expect to see him again. Whether this was because Carolina now considered York to be a traitor or because she didn't expect to survive her battle with Texas has been left unclear.\n\n====South====\n'''Agent South Dakota''', referred to as '''South''' (Shana Merlin), is another member of Project Freelancer. South signed up with her twin brother, who was appropriately given the codename North Dakota. Unlike some of the other operatives, however, South was not given an AI partner; according to South, there was more than one group of soldiers for implantation, and after complications with the first group, specifically Washington himself, no more AIs were given to operatives in the next group, including South.<ref>Burns notes in the commentary for Part Four of ''Recovery One'' that South feels resentment for not being given an AI, despite the problems some had presented, as she had been enthusiastic about receiving one.</ref> Later, Delta states she was part of an experiment alongside her brother, North, to analyze how some agents without AIs would respond to working with agents who did have them. She still, however, received an armor enhancement, able to create a domed energy shield.\n\nSouth's first appearance is in Part 2 of the mini-series ''Recovery One'', where she is found by Washington alongside her deceased brother. South claims that she found North already dead when she arrived, and North's AI, Theta, was already missing. Washington is ordered by command to kill South, but instead keeps her with him, as he believes the Freelancers are being hunted and he could use help. As he dislikes having an AI implanted into himself, he resolves to giving South the Delta AI he had already recovered. When they encounter The Meta, she shoots him in the back so she can make an easier getaway from their enemy. She then radios command, and it is revealed she also operates under the codename '''Recovery Two''', and that she was using Washington to draw out the enemy so that command could devise a strategy against it with the promise of an AI as a reward. She then refuses to return to base, flying away with Delta. Command threatens to locate her with other agents, but South claims she is more worried about something else.\n\nIn the opening episode of ''Reconstruction'', South's whereabouts are listed on a communications screen as still unknown. A very much-alive Washington states his desire to hunt her down, and his superior states that they are not far from letting him, also feeling the sting of her betrayal, although Washington harbors some resentment towards Command as well, given that South was under their orders when she attacked him. In Chapter 4 South is shown to be following Washington, but unbeknownst to her, The Meta is as well. In the next Chapter, Washington receives a call from his commanders alerting him to the fact that South is in critical danger, as shown by a distress beacon sent by Delta. When Washington and the others arrive, they find South under heavy fire from The Meta, using her energy shield enhancement to protect herself. She then attempts to abandon Delta and her enhancement so she can escape. Caboose guns her down to stop her from escaping. After The Meta leaves, Washington interrogates her, according to Delta, South also betrayed her brother North much like how she had betrayed Washington. Delta says that her injuries will only hinder them and there is a high probability she would betray them again, so Washington kills her in mid-sentence, securing vengeance for himself and North in the process.\n\nSeason 9 has featured South as an active operative under Project Freelancer, carrying out a mission with her brother North, during which they frequently employ a tag-team style of combat. She is much more impulsive in her actions, though, ignoring half of his advice, charging into most situations without thinking too far ahead, and much more eager to get her hands dirty. However, this same impulsive attitude often causes her to make bad decisions, forcing the Director to ban her from future missions. In ''Season 10'', South is allowed to participate in missions again, though she is clearly bitter over the fact that she will not receive an AI like North did. During the revolt on the 'Mother of Invention', she blocked Tex's way and nearly killed her out of spite, but is stopped by her brother, who fights her. Once she removes her helmet while complaining to the Director, South is revealed to be a blonde headed woman with a large scar on her left cheek.\n\n====North====\n'''Agent North Dakota''', referred to as '''North''' (John Erler), is South's twin brother, even dressing in similar armor.<ref name=\"NorthSouth\">In the ''Recovery One'' Part Two commentary, Burns and Hullum note that they gave North a purple suit with green trim to keep it apparent that the two were twins and hence dressed similarly, and surveyed people about which color, purple or violet, suited which character more.</ref>  His only appearance before the Season 9 flashbacks is of his dead body, which Washington found after receiving a distress signal sent out by North's armor. Like York, North still had his AI partner, Theta, in his possession at the time of his death, but Washington and South surmise that it was stolen by his attacker. While surveying his dead body, South gives a lengthy spiel about growing up with North and how the two of them were both so alike in almost every way. It is revealed in ''Reconstruction'' that South actually betrayed him in order to lure The Meta into stealing North's armor components, giving South the time she needed to flee. Delta claims she lured him into a position where he could be killed as opposed to killing him directly.\n\n''Season 9'' has featured North as an active operative under Project Freelancer, carrying out a mission with his sister South, during which they frequently employ a tag-team style of combat, perfectly in sync with each other. He's much more methodical in his actions than his sister, attempting to rein her in by being her voice of reason, but he also appears to have no problem adapting to sudden changes in the plan. In Season 10, it is revealed that he was given Theta due to North's caring attitude and Theta's shyness.\n\nNorth has provided an example of what happens when the enhanced armor abilities are utilized without the assistance of an AI unit, by applying a domed energy shield on top of a Pelican mid-flight to block oncoming missiles, which prevents the crash but leads him to collapse once his armor overheated. During the process, he removes his helmet, revealing himself as a blonde man, who in the incident gets a scar in his cheek that mirrors the one South already had. Later he ended up fighting his sister aboard the 'Mother of Invention'.\n\n====C.T.====\n'''Agent Connecticut''', also known as Connie or '''C.T.''' (Samantha Ireland) was a member of Project Freelancer, a Caucasian woman with brown hair and brown eyes shown to be much more unnerved and anxious about the rankings and missions, along with a wariness as to why they are pushed so far, and especially how the agents are pitted against each other. C.T. eventually defects to the Insurrectionists, romancing [[#Insurrectionist Leader|their leader]] and giving classified Freelancer information to him. As the Insurrectionists attack the Freelancer flagship, C.T. escapes with them to a hideout in a shipyard. Once the Freelancers attack, C.T. insists she and the Leader should escape, but he refuses to eave without his teammates. Tex and Carolina break into the bunker and C.T. tries to explain to them why she left Project Freelancer but the two do not believe her and a battle ensures. Tex ends up mortally wounding C.T. but the Leader manages to drag her into an escape pod, and they escape. As C.T. dies in his arms, she hands the Leader a device containing a location to where an artifact is. After she dies, the Leader then takes her armor and the C.T. codename.\n\nWhen Tex inspects a [[dog tag]] on C.T.'s locker, she finds a data chip that once uploaded, reveals a recording of C.T. informing her that after digging through Project Freelancer's files, she knows of what the Director has done to the Alpha and that Tex herself is the shadow of Allison; the Director's long-lost love. C.T. states she left this copy of the data she took specifically for Tex; not because she is the best fighter, but because she is the most trustworthy.\n\n====Maine/The Meta====\n[[Image:Meta RVB.jpg|thumb|The Meta, shown with seven AI: (clockwise from top left) Delta (green), Sigma (orange), Gamma (blue), Omega (grey), Eta and Iota (yellow, it is revealed that they can join together), Theta (blue and red) and Beta/Tex (light grey).]]\n'''Agent Maine''' is first introduced as '''The Meta''' (Matt Hullum), the primary antagonist of the Recollection trilogy. The Meta has an inability to speak, only communicating through in growls, due to an injury he sustained in earlier missions.\n\nHe first appears in ''Reconstruction'' as a mysterious character, who is hunting down Freelancers, killing them, and taking their equipment and AIs. He referred to as \"The Meta\" by Agent Washington and the Counselor, in reference to a cryptic message scratched into a wall of Outpost 17-B's Red base. He proves to be a capable foe for The Reds, Blues and Washington. Prior to the events of ''Reconstruction'' he managed to obtain seven AIs, and eventually obtains an eighth before losing them all when Washington sets off an EMP at Freelancer command.\n\nIn ''Revelation'', The Meta is shown to be working with Washington. He is also shown to have difficulties using his armor enhancements due to the loss of his AIs. The Meta later captures the revived Tex and betrays Washington, using the captured AI to power his cloaking field. Later, when the Reds and Blues attack, The Meta manages to fight them off, but Sarge tricks him and attaches a Warthog's tow-hook to his chest. Grif and Simmons push the Warthog over a nearby cliff. Sarge manages to dislodge the capture unit from The Meta's back just before he is pulled over the edge, where he falls to his death. This is confirmed by Chairman Hardgrove in Season 13 as he uses Maine's armor to give Locus and Felix incentive to work harder. Afterwards, Grif keeps his Brute Shot as a trophy.\n\nIn the Season 9 and 10 flashbacks, Maine is shown to be less skilled in combat than other Freelancers such as Tex and Carolina, relying primarily on brute strength than precise skill. However, he more than makes up for this through his incredible endurance. He is consistently shown to continue fighting despite suffering injuries that would cripple, if not outright kill, anyone else. During one mission in Season 9, Maine took a sniper bullet to the chest, got hit by a Warthog and had an entire magazine of bullets emptied into his neck, the injury that made him lose his deep and rough voice, and instead only growl. To help him communicate again, Carolina gave Maine her AI, Sigma. This leads her to later blame herself for the creation of the Meta, as Sigma corrupted Maine into going after other fragments. Season 10 reveals Maine's head, but not his face, showing that he is bald and has the Meta symbol tattooed in the back of his head.\n\n====Utah====\n'''Agent Utah''' (Kerry Shawcross) is briefly mentioned by Washington in the aftermath of North's hasty decision to use enhanced armor abilities in the field, which are presumably still in early experimental stages. Utah is provided as an example of how dangerous it is to use said equipment without the assistance of an AI unit, as during training it's implied such an action did not end well for Utah, possibly leading to death or severe injury.\n\nIn a deleted scene, Utah is shown to have been testing his bubble shield in training. Despite activating the armor enhancement in Project Freelancer facilities under a supervised environment, the shield only materialized around his head, quickly forcing him to pass out. This implies his death.\n\nIn an Easter egg after the credits on the season 10 DVD. It shows that Utah survived his test with the shield. Utah finds Georgia's lucky penny.\n\n====Georgia====\n'''Agent Georgia''' (Kerry Shawcross) was briefly mentioned by Agent Carolina before the team jumped out of the Pelican during the attack on the U.N.S.C. Scrap Metal Recycling Station. Carolina said that the team should use their jet packs sparingly or end up like Georgia. When Wash asked what happened to Georgia, South tells him that no one knows. In when the Freelancers use their jet packs to reach the station, York is surprised at this course of action given what happened to Georgia. When Wash again asks what happened to Georgia, York simply says, \"Dude, you do not wanna know.\" In Chapter 4, Washington tries to escape a nuclear bomb, but refuses to use his jet pack as he does not want to end up like Georgia. After the credits on the Season 10 DVD it shows what happens to Georgia. He slams in to a space station wall after forgetting his lucky penny.\n\n====Florida====\n'''Captain Butch Flowers''' ([[Ed Robertson]]) was the Blue Team's previous [[commanding officer]] at Blood Gulch. His character is introduced when Church arrives at Blood Gulch after \"travelling back in time\". Flowers had been planning to lead a Blue offensive to destroy the Red Team in Blood Gulch, claiming he knew the key to the Blues' victory. However, before he can lead the attack he dies in his sleep. Church attempts to save Flowers, but he suffers a fatal [[allergy|allergic]] reaction to the [[aspirin]] medication, and dies anyway. After Flowers' death, Tucker, who had been wearing regulation blue armor, claims his captain's armor for himself. In {{rvbep|Season 5}}, it is revealed that one of the Blues is to be promoted to captain, and Grif's sister is sent to fill the discrepancy.\n\nCaptain Flowers returns in Episode 96, wearing Tucker's old blue armor, accompanied by a new alien. He is revealed to be O'Malley's current host, and expresses a strong interest in Junior. Andy reveals in Episode 97 that the Alien revived Flowers. In Episode 99, he talks to Vic Jr. where they discuss their plans concerning Junior. Once O'Malley leaves his body he rejoins the Blue team in the final episode, but is shot in the head by a sniper rifle before he has a chance to reveal the information key to the Blues' victory. In season 16 it\u2019s revealed that Butch was killed by a future version of Tucker who accidentally killed him believing that the sniper rifle safety was off.\n\nFlowers appears unnamed throughout the flashbacks in ''Season 9'' and ''Season 10'', assisting the Freelancers. When they infiltrate the base to pursue the Leader and C.T., the Leader realizes he is being followed and throws a tomahawk, scoring a direct hit on Flowers and knocking him to the ground. However, he quickly recovers, pulls the tomahawk from his shoulder and throws it at the Insurrectionist Turret Soldiers pinning down the Freelancers. However, the tomahawk falls short of its target. He then shoots a nearby crane arm, which knocks the Insurrectionists into a pit, where they are crushed by a falling crate.\n\nIn the finale of ''Season 10'' it is revealed that he was a former agent of Project Freelancer, '''Agent Florida'''. He was tasked with protecting the Alpha in Blood Gulch, the Counselor then stated to the Director he would then cover up Florida's disappearance. It is implied that this is accomplished by destroying the state of [[Florida]].\n\n====Illinois====\n'''Agent Illinois''' was a demolitions expert and drinking buddy of York. Unlike many other Freelancer agents, Illinois was neither ambitious or competitive; instead he focused on his dream to own a home on a tropical island (with a tiny red sailboat), which he achieved after the fall of Project Freelancer. Temple later finds him, and kills Illinois with the armor lock mode. His armor, along with that of nine other agents, is seen in his secret room.\n\n====The Triplets====\nSeason 14 has two episodes focusing on the worst agents of Project Freelancer, who for their close friendship are nicknamed \"The Triplets\". They are '''Ohio''' (Elizabeth Maxwell), real name Vera, frustrated with the incompetence of her friends and not being assigned missions by Command; '''Idaho''' (Barrett Tribe), real name Ezra, a level-headed but incompetent soldier; and '''Iowa''' (Shannon McCormick), real name Mike, who after an accident that left him for minutes without oxygen became dim-witted and erratic, along with a destructive driver. For their bad performances but proficiency in working together, Command eventually gives them a mission in an ice planet, that turns out to be just an excuse to exhile the Triplets. In the planet, they find a base with equally stranded troops from Charon Industries, Sherry (Kat Ramzinski), Darryl (Aaron Alexander) and Terrill ([[Bill Wise]]) - a riff off of ''[[Newhart]]'' - and Ohio eventually decides to start a grudge which would basically become a [[stalemate]] reminiscent of how ''Red vs. Blue'' started (\"the only reason we need to be here is because they have a base over there, and the only reason they need a base is because we're here\").\n\nShannon McCormick, who also wrote the episodes, revealed that along with voicing the character named after his home state, he named  his companions for the states Iowa is normally confused with.<ref>[http://rootbeerflotsam.tumblr.com/post/172280156803/so-with-the-triplets-you-went-for-similar-names Shannon's Tumblr]</ref>\n\n===Freelancer Artificial Intelligences===\nCreated by Project Freelancer, the [[artificial intelligence|AI's]] are programs that are partnered with the Freelancers for improved performance (similar to [[Cortana (Halo)|Cortana]] in the original ''Halo''). The original AI, Alpha (Church), was tortured in order to split its personality, creating new AIs. Each of these fragments possessed a different aspect of the Alpha's personality. However, some of these AIs malfunctioned, resulting in events like Epsilon's attempted [[suicide]] and Omega's rampage. This brought the end of the implantation process. In ''Reconstruction'', The Meta seeks to possess the AIs and armor upgrades of all other Freelancers, and he eventually collected seven. These AIs were destroyed by an EMP at the end of ''Reconstruction''. The fragmented Alpha AIs currently survive as memories inside the Epsilon unit, as revealed in ''Revelation''.\n\n====Omega====\nA common enemy of both the Red and Blue Teams, '''O'Malley''' (voiced by Burnie Burns, Matt Hullum, or whoever the AI is possessing) is an AI program and the primary antagonist of ''The Blood Gulch Chronicles''. O'Malley's real name is '''Omega'''. The name ''O'Malley'' originates from a [[portmanteau]] of ''Omega'' and Tex's real name, ''Allison'' (Om'Alli). Tex claims Omega was a program designed to enhance her combat skills, but it also brought a violent attitude. According to Agent Washington, he inherited the ability to jump via radio to other hosts from the Alpha. Washington notes that while they tried to reassign him, he had a preference for Tex, and would always find his way back to her.\n\nO'Malley is sadistically evil and aggressive, and was originally intended as a [[parody]] of over-the-top, [[narcissistic personality disorder|megalomaniac]]al [[supervillain]]s. O'Malley, being the Alphas fragment of rage, wants to annihilate both teams, and take over the universe. He expresses these desires in long monologues accompanied by extended fits of evil laughter.\n\nToward the end of Season 1, just before Tex attacks the Reds, O'Malley assesses that Tex has little chance of survival and jumps via [[radio]] into Caboose. Under O'Malley's possession, Caboose periodically makes threatening statements, but O'Malley is never able to take full control, possibly due to Caboose not having much of a mind in the first place. After being forced out of Caboose by Church and Tex, O'Malley possesses Doc, of whom he is able to take control of and use to further his own agenda, however, Doc often resurfaces, causing O'Malley to constantly argue with himself. He seems to work for Vic to some degree, hiring Wyoming to assassinate Tucker. In Episode 73 it is revealed that O'Malley, Doc and Lopez had been hiding in a secret lair. In the {{rvbep|74|following episode}}, O'Malley, Doc, and Lopez return to Blood Gulch, at the request of Church, to [[diagnosis|diagnose]] Tucker's illness. Near the end of Season 4, he sees a chance to leave and jumps out of Doc.\n\nThroughout most of {{rvbep|season 5}} his location is unknown; the Blues assume he is in Sheila because of her erratic and violent behavior. The suspicion then falls on Church when Sheila reveals O'Malley's current location to be \"the Blue leader.\" This is quickly dispelled by Church in Episode 96 as he was never officially promoted, and it is then revealed that O'Malley is currently inhabiting Captain Butch Flowers. In Episode 100, Tex begins broadcasting on an open channel to lure O'Malley. O'Malley then jumps to nearly everyone in the canyon, and is then voiced by each character's respective voice actor. When he finally jumps into Tex, they board the ship and take off. Then Andy the bomb, who was placed on the ship by the Reds, detonates, apparently killing everyone on board.\n\nIn ''Reconstruction'' it is revealed that the ship crashed and Omega was stolen by a mysterious new enemy, The Meta. He was originally meant to have a larger role in Chapter 19, where a battle scene between The Meta and the Recovery Agents is shown. One projected idea was Omega possessing a Recovery Agent and using the body to kill other agents.<ref>Red vs. Blue: Reconstruction DVD commentary</ref> Omega is eventually wiped out with the seven other AI collected by The Meta during the EMP blast set off by Washington in ''Reconstruction''. However, he, along with the other AI fragments, survives as a memory in Epsilon.\n\nOmega appears in Chapter 15 of ''Season 10''. He is shown to be a much more menacing character than in ''The Blood Gulch Chronicles''. He speaks in a low guttural growl in an angry tone. During Tex's sparring match with Carolina, Tex orders Omega to log off and stay out of the fight, to which he snarls \"Next time.\" Omega then reveals the true extent of his malice when Carolina breaks down due to the strain having two AIs in her mind. He goads Tex to kill Carolina, but Tex resists.\n\nDespite Omega deletion in season 6 he was able to leave remnants of his personality in former hosts. Caboose who was infected by Omega in season 1 was able to enter a state of rage when angered while Doc after entering a alternate dimension in season 11 gained a split personality called O\u2019Malley who became the dominant personality in season 16.\n\nOmega is one of the few characters to be voiced by more than one actor; several of the production crew, including Burnie Burns, have claimed they prefer the O'Malley presented by Matt Hullum. The O'Malley presented by Hullum has been regarded as a combination of [[Stewie Griffin]], [[Dr. Evil]], [[Gollum]] and many other villains.<ref name=\"S2DVD\" />\n\n====Gamma====\n'''Gamma''', also known as '''Gary'''<ref name=\"cat\">According to the Season 4 Commentary, this character was named after Gus Sorola's cat, which died just before the completion of Season 4.</ref> by combining its name with that of its original owner, Reginald\\Wyoming, is an AI housed in a computer, similar to Durandal in ''[[Marathon (computer game)|Marathon]]''. He talks through [[Mac OS X]] [[speech synthesis|voice synthesizer]], System Voice \"Fred\", and represents the Alpha's Deceit.\n\nChurch first encounters Gary after he \"travels back in time\". He talks of the existence of \"The Great Weapon\", which is part of \"The Great Prophecy\". This prophecy later proves to be fictitious. He is fond of jokes, and sometimes uses [[knock-knock joke]]s to communicate instead of giving a straight answer. He claims to have been built by Aliens, but knows nothing about his creators, only about the ''Shisno'', a [[pejorative]] of [[human being|humans]] described as the equivalent of the feces of the feces of the foulest-smelling animal on the planet.\n\nAfter learning the name of Wyoming's AI (Gamma), Church concludes that Gary is actually Gamma and not an alien computer. Church phones Gary, and after an awkward conversation of Gary saying he is not Gamma, Gary hangs up, and has a short conversation with Wyoming himself, who instructs Gary to \"hop in.\" It is later apparent that Gary used Wyoming's special ability to loop back in time to contact Church. At the end of Episode 97 Gary occupies the tank which previously housed Sheila's AI. He begins to shoot at the Blues under the command of Wyoming, but Tucker quickly plugs a cable from the ship housing Sheila into the tank. Sheila downloads Gary into the ship and locks him behind a firewall.\n\nIn ''Reconstruction'', the ship that crash landed in Outpost 17-B is confirmed to be the same that housed Gary in the finale of the ''Blood Gulch Chronicles''. Afterwards, The Meta took both Gamma and the armor enhancement from Wyoming's helmet. Gamma is eventually wiped out with the seven other AI collected by The Meta during the EMP blast set off by Washington in ''Reconstruction.''\n\nIn Chapter 16 of ''Revelation'' the computer that Gary is normally represented by is seen while Tex and Epsilon-Church are talking. He makes an appearance in ''Season 10'', where he misleads Carolina on the strength of Tex's AI, Omega. Sigma, seeing an opportunity to get two AI in one target, builds on the lie.\n\n====Delta====\nThe AI fragment representing Alpha's logic, '''Delta''' (or \"D\" for short, voiced by Mark Bellman) is originally assigned to York. Unlike the other agents, York somehow retained his AI after the program closed. Unlike some of the other AIs, Delta does not pose a threat to anyone. Instead, he is extremely logical and analytical, to the point of being largely unfamiliar with human emotions. Matt Hullum has described Delta as \"largely devoid of personality.\"<ref name=\"RecOneP1\">''Red vs Blue: Recovery One'' Part One commentary</ref>  Delta is also polite and well-mannered, even bidding good luck to his enemy Wyoming when he believed himself to be shutting down. York often asks for Delta's advice on certain situations, such as whether or not to help Tex, and uses Delta to watch his left side during combat due to his visual impairment. Burnie Burns also notes that Delta was useful in ''Recovery One'' as a way of reminding the audience indirectly of the various rules of the freelancer program and the AIs.<ref name=\"RecOneP3\">''Red vs Blue: Recovery One'' Part Three commentary</ref>\n\nDelta often appears as a holographic miniature soldier beside York's head; the green glow was created in-game by using the plasma pistol according to Burnie Burns.<ref name=\"S5DVDComm\" />  However, Delta can modify his appearance to match the situation. When threatened by Tex, he went \"on alert\" and his glow turned red. Later, in a ploy to trick Wyoming, Delta managed to change his size and color, and appears as a hologram of Tex.\n\nAfter York was fatally wounded at O'Malley's base, Delta decide to stay with him, having picked up a fond attachment to his host. When an operative dies their armor shuts down the AIs within them, and so it was believed Delta perished with York. However, some time later, Agent Washington comes to collect Delta, who is alive and confused as to why he was not shut down. Washington explains that AIs are too expensive to simply destroy, so they are instead [[encrypted]] for a Recovery Agent to pick them up, after which they are stored. Washington then removes Delta from York's suit and takes him away. Delta is later implanted in South, as Washington dislikes having an AI due to a past incident. Agent Washington intends for her to assist him in confronting an unknown enemy that has been hunting the remaining freelancers. Following this, South betrays Washington, shooting him and taking Delta. It is then revealed this was part of commands plan. However, she betrays command as well and escapes with Delta, all she wanted was an AI.\n\nIn ''Reconstruction'', South is still shown to be in possession of Delta, who warns her about the risks of following Washington. They are attacked by The Meta, and South attempts to abandon Delta as bait, but she is stopped by Caboose. He is then given to Caboose as a new host just before Washington, on Delta's advice, kills South. Not long after, The Meta finds an unconscious Caboose, who split off from the group on Delta's insistence. Several other AIs appear around Delta as The Meta collects him, welcoming him while he remains silent. In Caboose's mind, Church discovers critical information that Delta left in order to help Washington: the message, \"Memory is the key.\" Caboose's mental projection of Delta also warns Church that the next time they meet, the AI may not want his help. In Chapter 16, it is revealed that Delta is the logic fragment of Alpha which the Alpha shed so as to not be able to analyze the suffering it endured. In Chapter 19 Delta is destroyed by the EMP set by Washington.\n\nDelta reappears briefly in ''Revelation'', when Epsilon-Church is temporarily disabled. He reveals that he and the other collected AI fragments have been able to secretly maintain their existence within Epsilon's memories. However, he fears Epsilon will eventually discover their existence. Delta then warns Caboose that Epsilon is trying to regain his memories, some of which could drive him to insanity again.\n\nDuring Season 12, episode 11 Epsilon-Delta is seen during Epsilon-Church's hyper-fast analysis of Carolina's fight with the Space Pirates; Delta questions Church's decisions. Church respond that \"sometimes, you just gotta have faith\".\n\nIn Season 13, episode 11 Carolina orders Church to run all of her armor enhancements at once. When Church begins yet another analysis, Delta freezes and dematerializes. During episode 20, Delta asks if Church is sure about defragmenting himself to power the Meta's armor, which Church confirms, before having Delta record his final goodbye to the Reds and Blues.\n\n====Theta====\n'''Theta''' (J.D. Burns)  was Agent North Dakota's artificial intelligence unit during the AI experimental program, the fragment that represents Alpha's Trust. Towards the program's end, Theta was assigned to North while North's twin-sister South was given no AI, to see how the three would react. Later on, when The Meta began to hunt down and kill the Freelancers, taking their equipment and AIs, Theta, North, and South were attacked by the rogue Freelancer. In order to survive, South allowed North to be killed (off-camera) and let The Meta take Theta so that she could escape.\n\nTheta remained with The Meta while he hunted down and took several more AI units. In ''Reconstruction'' Chapter 8, Theta is among the AIs that welcome Delta into The Meta's stolen AI collection. Theta is eventually wiped out with the seven other AI collected by The Meta during the EMP blast set off by Washington in ''Reconstruction.''\n\nTheta appears in ''Season 10''. In addition to now having more childlike proportions, he displays very childlike traits such as hiding behind North's leg when first introduced to other Freelancers and playing on a holographic skateboard during a lecture. He demonstrated exceptional skills in managing North's Shield enhancement.\n\nEpsilon-Theta later appears in Season 12, during Epsilon's hyper-fast analysis of Carolina's fight with Space Pirates.\n\n====Sigma====\n'''Sigma''' ([[Elijah Wood]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5905511/elijah-wood-stars-in-next-season-of-red-vs-blue-yes-really |website=[[Kotaku]] |date=April 26, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120429040130/http://kotaku.com/5905511/elijah-wood-stars-in-next-season-of-red-vs-blue-yes-really |archive-date=April 29, 2012 |first=Kate |last=Cox |title=Elijah Wood Stars in Next Season of Red vs Blue.

In ''Season 10'', he displays great interest in the idea of AI [[Marathon Trilogy#Rampancy|rampancy]], specifically the theoretical fourth stage, Metastability, in which an AI can be considered fully human. Sigma believed that if it brought together all of the AI fragments that he would become the Alpha. He even manages to trick Carolina into getting two AIs. It was Sigma that convinced Agent Maine to kill his fellow Freelancers and steal their AI and equipment, becoming The Meta. He never achieves his goal, however as Sigma, along with all the AIs captured by The Meta, was destroyed in an EMP.\n\n====Eta and Iota====\n'''Eta''' and '''Iota''', the Alpha's fear and happiness, were two artificial intelligences implanted in Agent Carolina. Originally intended for Washington or South, Carolina instead requested to receive two, so she could increase her abilities and become a better agent than Tex. Following the Freelancer Break-in led by Tex, the Mother of Invention crashes on Sidewinder, The Meta removes both from Carolina. They are eventually wiped out with the six other AI collected by The Meta during the EMP blast set off by Washington in ''Reconstruction.''\n\n===The Insurrection===\n'''Charon Private Security Forces''' also referred to as  '''The Insurrection''' or the '''Resistance''' by Project Freelancer is a military force that has defected from the UNSC, shown in the prequel sections of ''Season 9'' and ''Season 10'' and is the main antagonist of Project Freelancer However, they are actually UNSC soldiers hired by Charon Industries to act as their private security force. They are first seen in Chapter 2 of ''Season 9''. They take the attitude of nonchalance towards their duties, and are commonly used for comic relief during a stressful scene. They also show little aptitude in combat, and are repeatedly pummeled by the Freelancers. Some Insurrectionist, however, are more competent in combat, these soldiers serve as powerful foes to the Freelancers.\n\n====Insurrectionist Demo Man====\n'''The Insurrectionist Demo Man''' (Brandon Farmahini) first appears in ''Season 9'', Chapter 2, appearing to be in charge of the Bj\u00f8rdinal Cryogenics Research Facility. When North and South Dakota infiltrate the base to steal a data file, the Demo Man, along with dozens of other Insurrectionist soldiers, surround the two Freelancers on a heli-pad. He mans a turret and demands the two return the file, however Carolina appears and knocks him down and the three Freelancers proceed to fight the Insurrectionists. The Demo Man manages to get back on the turret and heavily injure North before Carolina sends him, along with other soldiers, into the water below. Later, when the Freelancers are infiltrating a building, he sends a squad up to kill the Freelancers. In the following chapter, he, along with dozens of Insurrectionists, surround the Freelancers on top of the building. He demands York disarm Tex's bomb, but York reveals it isn't a bomb, only a transmitter. York then hands the Demo Man the transmitter, who looks up just as a MAC round crushes the building.\n\nHe reappears in ''Season 10'', Chapter 7, revealing he survived the events of the previous season. In a battle at the Insurrection base, he drives a Warthog, while the Female Soldier uses the turret. Twice during the battle he saves the Female Soldier from being killed by Carolina. When lifts his arm to fire his shotgun, it is revealed that he has a robotic arm after the events of the previous season. He manages to do impressive feats with his new arm, such as catching a grenade from Maine's Brute Shot. Eventually, Maine throws the blade of the Brute Shot to slice his arm off, then knocks him into the water. In a deleted scene from ''Season 10'', after the battle at Longshore, he washes up on a beach. Having now lost both arms, he swears he will have his revenge on Project Freelancer.\n\n====Insurrectionist Sniper====\n'''The Insurrectionist Sniper''' (Nathan Zellner) first appears in ''Season 9'', Chapter 13. He wears binoculars on his helmet and has a cross-hair emblem on his armor. Later, in Chapter 17, he is part of the response team sent out to stop the Freelancers from stealing a briefcase. He, the Insurrectionist Female Soldier and the Sleeveless Soldier follow the Freelancers Warthog using jet packs and engage them on the highway.\n\nHe later appears in ''Season 10'', Chapter 7, using a seagull as target practice. In the following chapter the Freelancers attack the Insurrectionist base. As they begin their attack, the Insurrectionist Sniper appears, alongside other snipers and pins down the Freelancers. Carolina asks North for help and he throws his Domed Energy Shield in the direction of the snipers. The enhancement lands beside the group and activates. The Sniper then tells the soldiers to hold their fire. However, one of the soldiers fires at the shield and the bullet bounces off and kills him. The dead soldier falls, firing the rest of his ammo inside the shield causing the bullets to ricochet, killing the remaining soldiers including the Sniper.\n\n====Insurrectionist Female Soldier====\n'''The Insurrectionist Female Soldier''' (Hannah Hart) first appears walking down a highway with other high ranking Insurrectionists. She makes a larger appearance in the Chapter 17, where she is part of an Insurrectionist response team, sent out to stop the Freelancers on the highway. Her, the Insurrectionist Sniper and the Sleeveless Soldier follow the Freelancers Warthog using jet packs and engage them, they are unsuccessful. She prefers to dual wield pistols as her primary weapons.\n\nIn ''Season 10'', she asks why the Insurrectionists should trust C.T., who had recently defected. She removes her helmet and is revealed to be a blond, Caucasian woman. During the battle at the Insurrection base, her and the Demo Man fight Carolina and Maine on a platform. Eventually, she is knocked off but manages to grab on to the platform above the water. Maine, holding the Demo Man's disembodied, robotic arm, offers the Female a hand. She mistakes it for her fellow soldier and when she grabs it, Maine lets go and she falls down, hitting her back before falling into the water.\n\n====Insurrectionist Sleeveless Soldier====\n'''The Insurrectionist Sleeveless Soldier''' is a soldier that prefers to use brute strength over weapons. He first appears in ''Season 9'', Chapter 13, walking down a highway with other Insurrectionist leaders. In the next chapter, he appears as a member of the response team sent to stop the Freelancers from taking a briefcase. He, along with the Female Soldier and Sniper use jet packs to chase the Freelancer's Warthog. It is during this fight that the Sleeveless Soldier takes a pistol and shoots Maine in the throat, revealing how Maine became unable to speak.\n\nHe reappears in ''Season 10'' at the Insurrectionist base. When the Freelancers attack the Insurrection base, he works with the Female and the Demo Man to fight the Freelancers. He gives chase to Carolina but is stopped when a drop pod lands in between them. The door is kicked open, revealing an angered Maine inside. When his AI, Sigma, points the Soldier out to Maine as the one from the highway that shot him in the throat, Maine then punches him in the head hard enough to rip it off.\n\n====Insurrectionist Leader====\n'''The Insurrectionist Leader''' (Michael Joplin) is a high-ranking member of the Insurrection, recognized by the pill symbol on his chest. He seems to have a close relationship with C.T. as he is the only person she lets call her Connie. He first appears walking down a highway with other high-ranking Insurrectionists, carrying a briefcase. In the Chapter 19 he is seen talking to C.T. over video chat, but she is interrupted by Washington.\n\nIn ''Season 10'', he appears in the space ship graveyard along two other Insurrectionist Soldiers. While the Freelancers search for him, C.T. sneaks away to his location and hands him a data file. Later when the Freelancers search Bone Valley, the Leader commands an Insurrectionist destroyer ship, 'The Staff of Charon', and attacks the Freelancer frigate. The two ships fight but the Insurrection Leader escapes into Slipspace, leaving behind a nuclear device. However, the Freelancers and the frigate manage to escape the explosion.\n\nLater, he appears with C.T. entering the Insurrectionist base, while Wyoming spies on them. His companions aren't pleased to see C.T., as they distrust her. When the Freelancers attack, C.T. is surprised that her \"friends\" found her so fast and the two overlook the battle through cameras. While he and C.T. head to a bunker, he notices Florida up on a ledge. He throws a tomahawk at him, knocking him off. Suddenly, Wyoming snipes at him, shooting him in the foot, causing him and C.T. to retreat. While C.T. proposes that they leave to escape the Freelancers, he refuses to leave without his teammates. As the two argue, Tex and Carolina break into the bunker. While C.T. tries to explain that the Director is using the Freelancers, Tex is angered and attacks her. Eventually, Tex mortally wounds C.T., but the Leader manages to escape with C.T. in an escape pod. C.T. hands him another file, containing the location of an artifact, before dying in his arms. Stricken with grief, he puts on her helmet, revealing that he took on C.T.'s identity.\n\nThe soldier now known as C.T. appears in the desert excavation site where he claims to be working with a team of humans and aliens to uncover a structure. Tucker later reveals that he had in fact killed the actual dig crew. C.T. first appeared as the driver of an Elephant, assisting Sarge, Grif, and Caboose through an active minefield protecting the location of the temple. He appeared in the following chapter physically and introduced one of his alien \"co-workers\", Smith. He allows the trio to scavenge spare parts to fix their jeep so they can depart swiftly, but secretly makes plans to \"deal with\" them to Smith. When the temple door opens, he leads the dig team to try to kill Tucker, but is forced to call a retreat. After breaching the temple, C.T. manages to capture Epsilon-Church, angering the Aliens and causing them to revolt. C.T. flees the temple with Epsilon-Church while the Reds, Blues, and the Aliens give chase. Eventually the Reds and Blues catch up, destroy C.T.'s jeep, and he is finally killed by Epsilon-Church after refusing to reveal his identity.\n\n====Insurrection Turret Soldiers====\n'''The Insurrectionist Turret Soldiers''' (Michael Jones and Lindsay Tuggey) are a pair Insurrection soldiers that wield large turrets. One has a happy face painted on their visor and turret while the other has a sad face, and they both carry ammo canisters on their back. One of them first appears in ''Season 10'', Chapter 7, spray painting a turret yellow. In Chapter 9, they appear again, guarding C.T. and the Insurrection Leader. Wyoming and Florida watch from above, but the Leader notices Florida and throws a tomahawk at him, causing him to fall. The Leader then orders the two Turret Soldiers to suppress the area. Carolina, York and Wash soon join the fight and attempt to figure out how to bypass the soldiers when a cloaked Tex sprints past them. In anger, Carolina follows Tex using her Super Speed leaving the rest to fend for themselves. However, Florida picks himself up and uses a grenade launcher to shoot a crane holding a crate, knocking the two Turret Soldiers off of the platform. The crate then falls on the two killing them, and leaving a large yellow stain from their paint canisters.\n\n===Recurring unaffiliated characters===\n====Andy====\nBuilt by Tex, '''Andy''', full name Andrew D. Kaboom, (Nathan Zellner)<ref name=\"S4DVDProfiles\">[[Rooster Teeth Productions]] (2006). Character profiles. In ''[[Red vs. Blue (season 4)|Red vs. Blue Season Four]]'' [DVD]. Buda, Texas: Rooster Teeth Productions.</ref> is the short-tempered, rude, and vulgar [[bomb]]. Andy often expresses a desire to detonate himself to solve a problem, much to the worry the teams, who attempt to calm him down. Andy is apparently self-conscious about his weight. In {{rvbep|75|episode 75}}, after O'Malley repeatedly calls him \"bowling ball\", Andy asks Caboose if this is true, claiming that he has been working out. When Sarge steals Andy, he remarks that Andy is much lighter than the last time he tried to pick him up, and Andy is relieved that someone has noticed. Since Andy was built from parts of an old robot, he is able to speak. He also understands the Alien's language, and rest of the group use him to act as a [[translation|translator]]. In {{rvbep|76|Episode 76}}, the Reds steal Andy to translate a recording for them, which is stored in Lopez, but is in Spanish.\n\nLater, he was taken by O'Malley, then possessing Captain Flowers, but was left in the caves with Lopez after Flowers learned enough Alien language to get by. The Red team returns to pick him up in Episode 100 and plant him in the ship as a contingency plan. They order him to detonate if O'Malley tries to escape in the ship. O'Malley does so, so Andy detonates, seemingly killing everyone on board. Andy's fate is expanded upon somewhat in the [[Red vs. Blue: Reconstruction#Chapter 5|Chapter 5]] of ''Reconstruction''. Andy did explode, but while the blast did not destroy him, it caused major damage to the ship. Andy's fate after the crash landing is unknown.\n\nHe appears briefly in Season 9, in the Epsilon unit, where he is placed by Tex in the middle of the Reds. He then counts down, but to his dismay, does not explode.\n\nIn the Season 11 Episode \"Finders Keepers\" Tuckers voicemail system took him to Andy's and Quotes \"Hi you've reached the voicemail of Andy the bomb\".\n\nIn the Season 4 DVD commentary, the series creators stated that they originally wanted to explain Andy's rudeness by making him bitter about being rejected by Sheila, but it was never incorporated into the series.\n\n====Alien====\n<!-- FAIR USE of RvB_Alien.JPG: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:RvB_Alien.jpg for rationale -->[[Image:RvB Alien.JPG|250px|right|thumb|The Alien.]]\nAppearing for the first time at the end of Season 3, the '''Alien''' (Nathan Zellner)<ref name=\"Elite\">Although the Alien is a [[Covenant (Halo)#Elites (Sangheili)|Covenant Elite]] in the context of ''Halo'', he is never acknowledged as an Elite in ''Red vs. Blue''.</ref> scares Church out of his body after it wiped out Lopez's robot army single-handedly. This prompts the Blues to attempt to hunt him down, but they suffer a series of humiliating defeats. Even Tex is cut down seconds after attempting to attack the Alien, and, like Church, is forced to flee her body. Eventually, however, Caboose manages to befriend the Alien, who had found him unpalatable after biting him once. Conversely, the Alien has a strong odor to the Blues, who describe the smell with a series of unpleasant analogies.\n\nThe Alien has a habit of staying crouched, and its language appears to consist entirely of \"blarg\" and \"honk\". It seems to understand English, as it responds to other characters when they speak English, but it is unable to speak English itself. The Blues suggest a variety of names for the Alien including \"Crunch-bite\", \"Fluffy\", and \"Honk-Honk\". Gary later claims that the Alien is a member of the species that built him, though this later proves to be a lie.\n\nThe Alien reveals in Episodes {{rvbep|63|63}} and {{rvbep|64|64}} that he was on a quest to retrieve the sword that Tucker had discovered so that he could save his race from extinction. When the Alien first spots Tucker with the sword, he begins beat Tucker to a pulp relentlessly, upset that Tucker had discovered the sword first, as the sword only works for its original finder. The Alien consequently forces Tucker to join him on his quest, threatening to kill everyone otherwise. In {{rvbep|71|71}}, when the team reaches the temple in the Great Freezing Plains, the Alien has Tucker use the sword to unlock the gates to an alien ship. The Alien takes off in the ship, but he is almost immediately killed by Wyoming.\n\nIn {{rvbep|69}}, Tucker complains that the Alien is always standing over him when he awakes. Tex assumes that the Alien is simply obsessing over the sword. However, Andy accidentally reveals that the Alien's race reproduces by implanting [[parasite|parasitic]] [[embryo]]s in other beings. Soon after, Tucker gives birth to the \"baby\" or Junior who is heard off-camera speaking in higher-pitched \"honks\" and \"blargs\". In {{rvbep|99|99}} Tucker explains that the Alien's prophecy concerning the sword providing salvation for the Aliens did not fail with his death; instead, Junior, the son of Tucker and the Alien, is the intended savior of the Alien race.\n\nIn ''Revelation'', it was revealed that the Alien's claims of a \"prophecy\" was all a ruse. The entire plot of the ''Blood Gulch Chronicles'' was a simulation battle test for Freelancers, in this case, specifically for Tex.\n\n====Grunts and Red Zealot====\nThe '''Grunts'''<ref name=\"S3DVDComment\"/> (voiced by Rooster Teeth's members with altered pitches) are a group of eternally [[spawning (computer gaming)|respawning]] Reds and Blues originally from Battle Creek. Initially engaged in [[Capture the flag|Capture the Flag]], the group parodies the multiplayer mode of ''Halo'' and the stereotypical behaviors of online [[gamer]]s, using terms like \"rocket whore,\" \"[[camping (computer gaming)|camper]]\", and \"[[newbie|noob]].\" Once a match ends and everyone dies, they all inexplicably come back to life and immediately start another match. They downright worship the flag, with one of them in particular, '''The Red Zealot''' (Burnie Burns) having a far more religious mindset than his comrades do, and his fast-paced speech consists almost entirely of [[Bible|Biblical]]-type quotes and religious [[dogma]] all pertaining to flags, often speaking about [[crusade]]s and [[promised land]]s during battles.\n\nSarge and Caboose first encounter the Grunts near the beginning of Season 3. They become held up in the group's endless firefights, but eventually escape with Simmons' help. Simmons later teleports the group to Sidewinder and convinces them to attack O'Malley by claiming that he has their flag, but they are caught in the explosion with the rest of the characters. The Red Zealot later teams up with O'Malley after being separated from the other Grunts, having been convinced the rogue AI is the guardian of the Holy Temple. O'Malley, Doc, and Lopez find him annoying, but tolerate him because he performs menial tasks without complaint. The Zealot is killed by Tucker shortly after he finds the energy sword. Later on, the Grunts teams are seen working together to guard the temple in the Great Freezing Plains, but they still exchange [[trash talk]] with each other over armor color. They are all soon wiped out by Tex.\n\nIn Season 15, the Grunts are shown under the service of Temple. After Wash is shot in a firefight, Caboose proceeds to attack the Grunts in a rage.\n\n====FH57====\nFH57 were a group of Red simulation troopers who appeared in season 14 they were at war with AH13 blue team until they were killed by an Alien space craft that crashed into there base . Using the ship they search for more blue soldiers for months until finding life signs from Blood Gulch where they found the Reds and Blues and tried to make a plan to attack the Blue base by using there tank to kill the soldiers until they were found by Caboose  who told them that it already happened when he accidentally team killed the leader. Returning back to the ship after telling Caboose not to tell his teammates that they were here they returned to their ship which accidentally activated the self-destruction killing them.\n\nColonel Turf (Bruce Greene) was the reckless leader of FH57 who was determined to use the alien ship to hunt down and eradicate all the Blues in the galaxy.\n\nPrivate Sue (Lawrence Sonntag) was a red simulation trooper that was part of squad FH57. He was shown to be rather blunt expechally when confronted by Caboose in Blood Gulch and never seems to be too concerned with the situations he is presented with.\n\nLieutenant Drag (James Willems) was the \"cynical asshat\" of the red squad known as FH57.\n\nCaptain Morgan (Adam Kovic) was a member of the FH57 red team. Morgan is one of the smarter members of the group as he preferred to think things over and plan things out as opposed to rushing in. His name and rank is a reference to a brand of Rum.\n\nMajor Santos (Joel Rubin) was a member of the FH57 red team. Santos\u2019s is shown to be handy with mechanics and for some reason had an obsession with wine bars. Because of this, he took advantage of Peake's alien cult to stage a mutiny however after hearing a motivation speech from Turf he and Peake stopped the mutiny and was happy when Turf said that there can be room on the ship for a wine shelf.\n\nPrivate Peake (Matt Peake) was the quiet member of the red squad known as FH57. Inside the alien ship Peake discovered several aliens living in the cargo hold, and after giving them food he became their grand leader. He alongside Santos attempted a mutiny as they were both fed up by their leader Turf's current actions however after hearing a motivation speech from Turf he and Santos stopped the mutiny.\n\nCherry (Elyse Willems) was an alien ship AI that was repaired by Santos who assisted FH57 on their travels to find blue soldiers. However she had technical problems that caused her to misunderstand verbal commands causing her to initiate the self destruction after mishearing Turf saying shelf-construction killing her and the rest of FH57.\n\n====Other Alien====\nWhen Captain Flowers returned as O'Malley's new host, he brought with him a new alien partner, referred to as the '''Other Alien''' on his DVD profile. In Episode 97 it was revealed that the Other Alien is seeking the original Alien for unknown reasons, and it revived Captain Flowers to assist him. The pair of them then begin searching for Junior as well. Flowers is working with O'Malley, Vic Jr. and Wyoming to exploit the Alien's race, however Flowers' dialogue with Vic Jr. reveals that the Other Alien is unaware of this fact. The Other Alien follows O'Malley and Junior onto the ship in {{rvbep|100}}. In ''Reconstruction'', when Washington and the Blues were looking over the footage from the crashed Pelican, a door is heard opening and Tex says \"Wait, where are they going? Close the hatch.\" And the Alien, and Junior were not found on the ship, implying that the Other Alien escaped with Junior to safety.\n\n====Smith====\n'''Smith''' (Jack Pattillo) is one of the Aliens working with the soldier known as C.T., and he appears to be second in command. On his first appearance he is disturbed by the arrival of Sarge, Grif and Caboose. In ''Recreation'' Chapter 18 he beats down Jones in retaliation for shooting Epsilon-Church, and when C.T. flees with Epsilon-Church, Smith gives chase, but is taken out when C.T. destroys his vehicle. He survives, however, and is seen standing in front of the temple at the end of the scene. Later in ''Revelation'', he is seen, along with the other aliens, worshipping Epsilon-Church. He is eventually killed along with the rest of the aliens by Washington and The Meta.\n\n====Allison====\n'''Allison Church''' (Lindsay Hicks) was the Director's loved one that had died in a war, whose physical appearance in ''Season 10'' marks the first character portrayed by a live action actor instead of an animation. Her death has haunted the Director ever since then and when the Alpha AI was created the memory of her was so strong it created a 'shadow' of her Which gave The Director the idea of fragmenting the Alpha). This 'shadow' was put in a robotic body, given the codename Tex, retaining the memories of Allison. The Director remembered Allison for her failure to survive and therefore, Tex is always destined to fail, no matter how close she may be to victory.\n\nIn ''Season 10'', Tex and Carolina were about to fight in the training room, when the Director notices. The Director, worried about Tex, called out \"No! Allison!\". This caused all the AIs in the area to begin muttering 'Allison' due to them also having memories of Allison from the Alpha. Later in the season, Washington was implanted with Epsilon. As Epsilon's memories were also from the Alpha, when Wash was given Epsilon, he immediately began having flash memories of a conversation the Director had with Allison before she went off to war.\n\nIn the epilogue of \"Season 10,\" Carolina talks to Epsilon-Church about her mother. She says her mother was gone a lot, and it seemed like she always had important things to do, but her mother never said goodbye. Carolina explains that her mother disliked goodbyes because the person wasn't really gone, they just weren't there right now. This interaction strongly implies that Allison is indeed Carolina's mother, and\u2014as implied by her green eyes and the Director's last words to her, \"You were my greatest creation\"\u2014that Leonard Church is her father.\n\n====Siris====\n'''Siris'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/RoosterTeeth/status/752498928499642368|title=Rooster Teeth on Twitter|access-date=2016-10-03}}</ref> ([[Christopher Sabat]]), full name Mason Wu,  appears in Episodes 9, 10 and 11 of ''Season 14,'' as part of a three-part story centered around Locus and Felix before the events of the Chorus trilogy. He is a bounty hunter working with Locus and Felix to apprehend criminals and bring them to custody as a way to make money to support his wife, Megan. He aids them in the capture of Gabriel Lozano, son of mafia boss Reuben Lozano, and later finds out that his criminal record was erased. When Felix suggests holding Gabriel for ransom for more than he was initially worth, Siris objects at first, but reluctantly accepts. When Reuben threatens to kill the bounty hunters (or their loved ones, should they escape), disowns Gabriel, and reveals he knows their hiding location, Siris attempts to back out of the mission to defend his family, but ultimately stays, assisting them in killing Reuben and his henchmen. The very next morning, the three decide to pawn Reuben's limousine to cover the original equipment costs. He is the sniper on the team, and is in charge of surveillance and support.\n\n====Interstellar Daily====\n\n\n====Dylan Andrews====\nDylan Andrews (Anna Margaret Hollyman) is an investigative journalist for the ''Interstellar Daily'', who while reporting on attacks seemingly caused by the Reds and Blues, does not believe the Blood Gulch Crew did them, due to having previously written an article (shown in Season 12) about how the Reds and Blues, along with Carolina and Washington, took down Project Freelancer and their subsequent pardon. Her search for the truth on what apparently turned the Reds and Blues from hapless heroes to cold-blooded criminals is the main focus of Season 15. In her investigation that starts on Blood Gulch, where Dylan removes VIC from his mainframe promising to delete him after he helped her, Dylan meets the Reds and Blues, helps them find the true perpetrators, the Blues and Reds, and is apprehended by Loco and Temple once she finds out they have ulterior motives. She is eventually freed and helps the Blood Gulch Crew in the final battle against the Blues and Reds.\n\nAt the beginning of ''the Shisno Paradox'' Dylan and Jax remain behind on the island to clear the Reds and Blues name with the police, as the UNSC still believes they are terrorists. She later calls Carolina to inform that the soldiers have seemingly time travel due to the discovery of ancient art pieces inspired by the Reds and Blues.\n\n====Jax Jonez====\nJax Jonez (Joe Nicolosi) is a [[film school]] student brought by his uncle, ''Interstellar Daily'' editor Carlos Trabka (Bill Wise), to be Dylan's new cameraman. However, instead of just doing his job, Jax is constantly trying out new filming techniques and forgetting things. He claims he is good at accidentally finding things that \"advance the plot.\" After being captured by Temple, he is shot in the knee when he angers him. Still, Jax participates in the final battle against the Blues and Reds.\n\nIn ''the Shisno Paradox'', Jax is directing a film about the events of Season 15, whose production is troubled by the Reds and Blues\u2019 time traveling shenanigans. Jax is depicted here as having become a deranged, mood swinging prima donna who threatens his crew, particularly his producer Kohan Wooter (a caricature of Rooster Teeth producer Koen Wooten, who even provides the voice). Jax eventually bankrupts the film when he uses time travel to add in famous film actors from the past, and is hit with a hammer by Atlus when trying to get a time travel machine to get funding from the past.\n\n====Spencer Porkensenson====\nSpencer Porkensenson (Jason Marnocha) Is a process server who first appears in season 15 episode 2 The Cronicle following Dylan and Jax  to find Lavernius Tucker. He later fought in a firefight with the Blue and Reds mistakenly believing that Bucky was Tucker. In the episode Nightmare On Planet Evil he finally finds Tucker who tells him that he was sent by Chorus to serve him Tucker believes that he is his bodyguard manservant until he tells him that You've Been Served child support papers by the new mothers of Chorus much to his horror. Completing his mission he bids the Reds and blues farewell as he will not be seeing them again unless it\u2019s in service of the court and tells them his name and that he lives to serve and flies away.\n\n====Cyclops====\nCyclops, or C.C.(Katie Newville), is a large Cyclops Mark II-class military assault droid that was located inside the UNSC Hand Of Merope .It was later found by Sarge who wanted to take it back to base and destroy Freckles as he deemed it a threat however it was too big to bring back in one piece so the Reds dismantle it, and took it back to base to be reassembled. While bringing the parts back to base Grif loses various pieces of the robot forcing Sarge to use the parts he has to reconstruct the robot resulting in it being Mantis-sized. When Sarge activated Cyclops it spoke its name with a female voice making them call it a girl. Before Sarge was about to order her to attack Freckles she threatened the Reds as she had a hardware malfunction believing that there are 16 hostile in the canyon and was about to attack the Reds but shuts down due to Sarge converting her fuel tank to diesel resulting in her running out of power. Cyclops was later repaired by Lopez and Lopez 2.0 but was taken over by Dos.0 who used her to attack Sarge and the Reds and Blues but was later destroyed by Donut who teleported Cyclops and Dos.0 to a mine field killing them.\n\n====Epsilon Doubles====\nThe Epsilon Doubles are the main characters of season 9. When Epsilon-Church entered the Epsilon unit to look for Tex after the events of season 8, he recreated Blood Gulch by using the Alpha\u2019s memories while creating copies of the Reds and Blues. The doubles are similar to the real Reds and Blues, despite acting different at first.\n\nSarge (\u03b5) differs from his real-world counterpart in that he doesn\u2019t hate Grif, is not willing to yell at the other Reds, and allows Donut to give orders. However, after having a private conversation with Donut that lasts a couple of hours, Sarge reverts to his original personality.\n\nSimmons (\u03b5) is nearly identical to his real life counterpart. He expresses that he \"hates when things change\" as his teammates obtain their original personalities. When he is about to be killed by Andy (\u03b5), he reveals that he respects none of his teammates.\n\nDonut (\u03b5), described by Epsilon as being a \"repressed, over-achieving jarhead,\" orders Sarge and Simmons around when he first appears. He acts violent, wanting to shoot Epsilon on sight rather allowing him to speak. Donut (\u03b5), like his real-world counterpart, keeps a diary. He makes sexual innuendos for much of the time he spends onscreen. After talking with Sarge, he reverts back to his original personality.\n\nGrif (\u03b5) is unlike his real-world counterpart in that he appears to be a hard worker. When asked by Simmons to take a break, he claims to be unfamiliar with the concept. he was an extreme neat-freak, shouting at Donut for tracking mud on Red Base's recently waxed floor. It has been hinted that Grif has OCD, which is indicated after he says that doing things 3 times is fun and was hinted to be a germaphobe. when Grif had a break Donut again tracked mud into the base but instead of shouting at him again he told him that he didn\u2019t care saying that he\u2019s on break returning to his original personality.\n\nLopez (\u03b5) personality was originally very robotic and monotone, as he has only been seen going through his activation speech and alerting everyone of an earthquake however he also hates the Reds due to there stupidly and not understanding him.\n\nTucker (\u03b5) personality is the same as his real world counterpart being very foul mouthed, annoying, and perverted in the eyes of other characters however he has a better relationship with Caboose.\n\nCaboose (\u03b5) personality is the same as his real world counterpart being loving and wanting Church's friendship however he has a better relationship with Tucker.\n\n====Caboose's Mental Images====\nCaboose's mental images are a small group of characters based on the main characters however they all have different personality than their real-world counterparts and behaved depending on how Caboose sees them in reality.\n\n'''Mr. Caboose'''\n\nMr Caboose is the smart polite leader of Blue Team the exact opposite of the real Caboose\n\n'''Tucker'''\n\nTucker is the dumb, butt-sniffing coward who uses the same energy sword that the real Tucker uses except that anyone can use it due to Caboose not understanding that the sword is lock to him.\n\n'''Leonard'''\n\nLeonard (Church) is Caboose loud foul-mouthed best friend who was killed by O'Malley resulting in Caboose temporary losing any memory of the real Church.\n\n'''Sister'''\n\nSister also known as Yellow Church is Caboose's twisted version of Sister and Church which Caboose believes to be Church's twin brother.\n\n'''Sarge'''\n\nSarge is the stern and regimented leader of the Red Team who speaks with both a pirate accent and a cockney accent.\n\n'''Simon'''\n\nSimon (Simmons) is the weak-kneed sycophant with a shrill voice and a bad memory.\n\n'''Orangish Guy Whose Name I Really Don't Remember\n'''\nOrangish Guy Whose Name I Really Don't Remember (Grif) is the drunk whose name is always forgotten or mispronounced. Unlike his real Self Orangish Guy Whose Name I Really Don't Remember armor colour is yellow.\n\n'''The Girl on the Red Team\n'''\nThe Girl on the Red Team (Donut) is a teenage girl who mistakenly thinks that her rifle is a purse and having a crush on Caboose.\n\n'''Agent Washingtub\n'''\nAgent Washingtub(Washington) is a superhero who portrays himself in a clear and consistent manner while using his freelancer powers to scare those trying to help him and to fight monsters and scary people from the future.\n\n==References ==\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official website|http://rvb.roosterteeth.com/|''Red vs Blue'' official website}}\n* [http://www.roostertooths.com/ RoosterTooths.com \u2013 an unofficial ''Red vs Blue'' resource website]\n\n{{Red vs. Blue}}\n{{Rooster Teeth Productions}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Red Vs.

He is voiced by [[Matt Hullum]], co-creator of the series, and first appeared at the end of {{rvbep|1|Episode 1}}. He has a [[Southern American English|Southern accent]], and has a military background and briefly joined the [[ODST]]s. Sarge is somewhat bloodthirsty, and the only Blood Gulch soldier on either team to actually be serious about war. As a result, Sarge gets unsatisfied at times of peace and is often willing to join new battles, which in Season 15 led him to delusional battles while in retirement \u2013 first creating an army of robots, then declaring war on [[gravity]] \u2013 and then join the Blues and Reds to help the war on the UNSC, betraying the Reds and Blues. His preferred weapon is a [[shotgun]], which he carries at all times. Sarge has a passionate disgust for Grif, demonstrated by his repeated willingness to sacrifice Grif during combat missions as well as creating numerous contingency plans that all consist of killing Grif outright. He has something of a father-son relationship with Simmons, but is either oblivious to Simmons' feelings or just doesn't seem to care. He displays little knowledge of strategy or tactics and his plans are often horrible suicide missions, but he is shown to be a good mechanic, able to repair Jeeps with limited supplies and construct complex droids, and a good motivational speaker, speaking to both teams at various times throughout the later seasons. Sarge's real name is never revealed on screen. In Season 14, the cameraman asks Sarge for his name and rank, to which he replies 'Sarge'. Thinking he simply gave his rank, Sarge is then asked for his name, to which he insists that he 'just said that'. In Season 15, in exchange for their help, he tells Dylan and Jax his name. Though it is never said on screen, with Jax simply asking if it is 'Russian, Scandinavian or Pig Latin' as it 'sounded like 57 syllables' to which Sarge replies by saying that 'you need to use a Mandarin translator and the fifth letter is an emoji'.\n\nSarge is played by Saul Portillo in the live-action, crossover episode ''Immersion: The Warthog Flip''.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://achievementhunter.roosterteeth.com/episode/immersion-season-4-the-warthog-flip-behind-the-scenes |publisher=[[Rooster Teeth]] |date=October 12, 2016 |title=Immersion: The Warthog Flip - Behind The Scenes |accessdate=October 13, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Simmons====\n[[Captain (armed forces)|Captain]] Richard \"Dick\" Simmons ([[Gus Sorola]]), upon his introduction, is the second-in-command of the Red Team, being an attentive and [[sycophant]]ic follower to Sarge. Simmons and Grif were the first two characters to ever appear in Red vs. Blue, appearing at the start of {{rvbep|1|Episode 1}}, and both are friends in spite of their constant bickering and personality clashes. Simmons is shown to be logical, practical and intelligent, showing extensive knowledge of technology and computers. However, his reasonable inquiries and effective battle plans and strategies are always overlooked by Sarge. Simmons even twice defected to the Blues after getting frustrated with Sarge. Simmons' worthiness is often hindered by his lack of self-confidence, insecurity (particularly regarding talking to women) and panicky nature - he loses control in time-sensitive or complicated situations, as well as in situations that highlight his [[Ophidiophobia|fear of snakes]].\n\n====Grif====\n[[Captain (armed forces)|Captain]] Dexter Grif ([[Geoff Ramsey]]) is noted for being lazy, grumpy, and gluttonous, \nwhich led to Sarge disliking him and constant bickering with his friend Simmons. In spite of his abrasive nature, Grif has a begrudging kinship to his teammates, and will eventually come to their aid. While ''Red vs. Blue: The Ultimate Fan Guide'' stated Grif was forced into the Red Army in a military draft, Season 16 instead reveals Grif enlisted after dropping out of college in [[Ithaca, New York]]. Grif is shown to be relatively adept at driving vehicles, even managing to fly a Pelican and a Hornet with next to no experience with aircraft. He is also shown to be exceptionally hard to kill, being able to survive multiple shots, being run over by a tank, and falling from extreme heights. He was twice promoted, first to Sergeant before ''Reconstruction'' once he was relocated out of Blood Gulch, but is later demoted to the fictitious rank of \"Minor Junior Private Negative First Class\" because of a deal between Sarge and Agent Washington; and then to Captain as leader of his own squad of Chorus' New Republic, which leads Sarge to ask a promotion to Colonel to continue outranking Grif.\n\nJoe Nicolosi, who wrote and directed Season 15 and 16, has Grif as a favourite character, and thus he is heavily featured in those seasons. In the former, while he refuses to join the quest that leads the Reds and Blues out of their retirement moon, Grif goes insane from loneliness and guilt, eventually being brought by Locus to save his friends from the Blues and Reds. In ''The Shisno Paradox'' after convincing the Reds and Blues to get pizza, Grif decides to use what he learned from a book in [[narrative structure]] and avoid [[inciting incident|\"incendiary incidents\"]] that would lead to new adventures, going all the way to crashing the crew's ship to not answer a call from Locus. However, on the way to Grif's favourite pizzeria, which ends up destroyed, they are roped into a time-travelling plot by Donut.\n\nBeginning in ''[[Halo 3]]'', Grif has had a multiplayer game based around him called \"Grifball\". Inspired by a throwaway line in [[Red vs. Blue (season 4)#Hunting Time|season 4]] where Sarge comments that shooting Grif \"is the best game since Grifball!\", Rooster Teeth developed a [[rugby football|rugby]]-like gaming mode where Grif would be repeatedly killed, as the objective is to carry a bomb all the way to the opposing team's [[Goal (sport)|goal]], with the player holding the bomb having his armour changed to Grif's orange. Along with the other players trying to stop the \"Grif\" with Energy Swords and Gravity Hammers, scoring also leads the bomb to explode, often killing the carrier. As summed up by Burnie Burns, \"everyone in the game is constantly trying to hammer-smash Grif and even if he scores, he explodes. Either way, Sarge wins.\"<ref>[http://www.grifballhub.com/respect-your-roots-agla-winter-league-08/ GrifballHub: Respect Your Roots-AGLA Winter League 08]</ref>\n\n====Donut====\n[[Private (rank)|Private]] Franklin Delano Donut (Dan Godwin) hails from [[Iowa]], and first appears in Episode 3 of {{rvbep|Season 1}} as a new recruit. He originally sported standard-issue red armour, but due to an inadvertent series of events, he is eventually given a pink armour, whose color Donut often denies, calling it \"Lightish Red\", and even causes the Blues to mistake him for a woman in the first two seasons. The pink armour also changes Donut's personality and makes him ambiguously homosexual, constantly spewing double entendres and talking with a more feminine attitude. While Donut is affable, his garrulous personality tends to annoy other members of the Red Team, along with being childish and gullible - Lopez, in particular, hates Donut's bad attempts at translating his Spanish speech. Donut's biggest combat skill is a proficiency in throwing grenades.\n\nWhile Donut was one of the focal characters in ''The Blood Gulch Chronicles'', he is often relegated in later seasons, even being supposedly killed in the ''Recreation'' season finale, later revealed to have sent him into Recovery Mode, which locks down the user's armor in the event of heavy injuries. This lack of focus made Joe Nicolosi decide to make Donut the plot-driving character in ''The Shisno Paradox''. There, after being zapped by a time machine in the previous season's last episode, Donut becomes unstuck in time and his body is destroyed by various temporal distortions. Once reunited with the Reds and Blues, he says he met God and gives his friends time-portal guns that allow travelling through time and space. However, the \"God\" was actually an ancient deity called Chrovos, who wanted to cause a [[temporal paradox]]  that would break reality and thus release him from his prison. Donut refuses to believe Chrovos is evil and serves as a mole with the Reds and Blues, stealing the Hammer. After realizing Chrovos intends to kill his friends, Donut turns against him and engages Doc in a battle throughout time, ultimately defeating Doc with a well timed frag. Donut then uses the Hammer to partially seal Chrovos in his prison while the Reds and Blues inadvertently cause the paradox. Donut, having been outside time, keeps his memories and attempts to warn the Reds and Blues, who are trapped in a singularity reliving past adventures. Finding his attempts to warn them are only making things worse, Donut realizes Agent Washington is outside of time and thus also unaffected. Donut then travels to the point where the paradox started and begins searching for Washington.\n\n====Lopez The Heavy====\n'''Lopez the Heavy''' (Spanish: ''Lopez la Pesado'' [sic], full name Droid #01011331123;<ref name=\"S3DVDProfiles\">[[Rooster Teeth Productions]] (2005). Character profiles. In ''{{rvbep|season 3|Red vs. Blue Season Three}}'' [DVD]. [[Buda, Texas]]: Rooster Teeth Productions.</ref> voiced by [[Burnie Burns]]) is a robotic mechanic built by Sarge with a robot kit. He does not speak for most of Season 1, and it is eventually revealed that he is a robot that is missing a speech unit. Sarge orders a speech unit, but accidentally damages it with a static electric discharge during the installation process, which causes Lopez to speak only Spanish. Sarge sees it as an improvement because the enemy won't be able to understand him if he's ever captured, despite not knowing Spanish himself. However, he is able to understand English just fine. The extent to which the characters understand Lopez varies for the sake of comedy, with Sarge pretending to know what Lopez is saying, and Donut's narrow grasp of Spanish leading to bad mistranslations. In his state of loneliness and guilt in Season 15, Grif becomes fluent in Spanish and is able to communicate fully with Lopez. Lopez has a stoic, tough personality, although as time went on he developed a pessimistic view, often questioning his orders and making sarcastic remarks about his teammates. A running gag, starting with {{rvbep|Season 3}}, has Lopez being reduced to just a head, though he does get a new body (which is almost always destroyed eventually) from time to time.\n\n===Blue Team===\n<!-- FAIR USE of Rvb Blue Team Halo 3 Engine.jpg: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Rvb Blue Team Halo 3 Engine.jpg for rationale -->\n[[File:Rvb Blue Team Halo 3 Engine.jpg|thumb|300px|The {{rvbchar|Blue Team}}, from left to right: Tucker (Aqua), Tex (Black),  Epsilon-Church (the monitor), Sheila (the tank), Alpha-Church (Cobalt) and Caboose (Blue).]]\n\n====Church====\n[[Private (rank)|Private]] Leonard L. Church (Burns) is the [[de facto]] leader of the Blood Gulch Blue Team. Rooster Teeth often uses Church, who has an irate disposition,<ref name=\"RvBS4DVDCommentEp76\">Burns, ''et al.'', 2006, Audio Commentary, episode 76.</ref> to advance the plot by managing the situation at hand.<ref name=\"RvBS1DVDCommentEp18\">Burns, ''et al.'', 2003, Audio Commentary, episode 18.</ref> Another characteristic of Church is his terrible aim, mostly with his signature [[sniper rifle]], though at one point he cannot hit a soldier standing a few feet away with a pistol.\n\nTo provide a twist in character development, Burns decided to kill Church early in the series and have him return as a \"ghost.\" In ''Reconstruction'', Washington reveals to Church that he is the Alpha AI from which the other Freelancer Program AIs originated. As like in ''Halo'' canon, smart AIs are based on an actual person, Church was based on the director of Project Freelancer, the original Dr. Leonard Church. Through psychological torture, the Alpha tried to keep his sanity by breaking off parts of his personality, that become the AI fragments.\n\nWhile shortly after his reveal as the Alpha Church is caught up in an [[electromagnetic pulse]] blast and destroyed, the character returns starting in ''Reconstruction'' through one of its fragments, Epsilon, which was the Alpha's memories. Upon his creation, Epsilon went rampant during an at being implanted into Washington, causing Wash to go insane, the AI implantation program to be cancelled, and Epsilon to be sent into storage. In ''Reconstruction'', Washington and Church retrieve the Epsilon capsule from a Freelancer facility, which Wash then gives to Caboose. In ''Revelation'', it is revealed Caboose is trying to transfer the AI from the capsule to a new robotic body while telling stories to him, given Epsilon responds well to them given his status as a memory keeper. In the desert where Tucker was reassigned, Caboose finds a round artifact (a Monitor from ''Halo''), and transfers Epsilon into it. Epsilon-Church has residual memories of the original Church, inheriting his voice and personality. However, his memories of Alpha's life on Blood Gulch are at first limited to the stories that Caboose had told him.\n\nIn ''Revelation'', memory flashes of Epsilon-Church eventually lead him to a Freelancer facility, where he brings Tex back to life and transfers himself into a new human-like robot body, whose armor is the same color as the old Church's. Tex brings Epsilon to another Freelancer base and activates his recovery beacon as bait for Washington and the Meta. However, the Meta then captures Tex in a storage unit. After the battle, Church enters the unit to retrieve her.\n\nIn Season 9, Epsilon makes a recreation of Blood Gulch based on his memories inside the storage unit waiting for Tex to come to him. After reuniting with Tex and believing the memory unit to be failing, he decides to forget her to find inner peace before what he believes will be his demise. Caboose then brings him out of the memory unit. It is then revealed that Carolina helped them rescue Epsilon-Church so that he can help her kill the director. After Carolina confronts the director at the end of Season 10, Epsilon remains as the former Freelancer's partner.\n\nDuring Season 13, Epsilon is shown to malfunction when overworked by  Carolina. This eventually leads to the Church's ultimate demise: to ensure Tucker can wear The Meta's suit, Epsilon deconstructs himself into different Fragments, each running one of the suit's enhancements. Once the battle is over, the fragments vanish.\n\nIn Season 14, it is revealed that the body of Church prior to his \"death\" in Season 1 was actually Pvt. Jimmy, who was talked about also in Season 1. Pvt. Jimmy was implanted with the Alpha before going into Blood Gulch, and that A.I. turned Pvt. Jimmy into Pvt. Leonard Church.\n\nIn season 15, the Reds and Blues are lured out of their retirement moon by a distress call which seemed to be from Church. However, it is later revealed it was a ruse by the Blues and Reds, who edited a message from the original Church to lure in the Reds and Blues to them. Still, through Loco's time machine, a portal is opened to Blood Gulch during the first season, and Caboose uses the opportunity to tells Church a heartfelt goodbye, even if it means he will never see his friend again. In the post-credits scene, a confused Church resolves to forget this conversation ever happened.\n\n====Tucker====\n[[Captain (armed forces)|Captain]] Lavernius Tucker ([[Jason Salda\u00f1a]]) is known for his womanizing and oversexed mind, uttering the catchphrase \"bow chicka bow wow\" at every phrase he deems unintentionally sexual. His signature weapon is the Energy Sword, which Tucker finds in Season 3 and only works for him. The weapon also leads Tucker to be attacked by an Alien and impregnated with a parasitic embryo, which later becomes his hybrid son Junior. He turns out to be the best combatant among the original Reds and Blues, single-handedly fending off C.T.'s team in ''Recreation'', and stabbing The Meta with his sword in the final fight of ''Revelation''. Two running gags about Tucker had him complaining he never gets to use the Sniper Rifle \u2013 though in Season 5, Tucker turns out to shoot well with it \u2013 and his armor getting coated with \"black stuff\" whenever he goes through a teleporter.\n\nAfter the Blood Gulch Chronicles, it is stated that Tucker and Junior were recruited as ambassadors between the humans and aliens, and transferred to a desert. After being absent from ''Reconstruction'' aside from a brief voice appearance calling Freelancer Command about his mission, he returns in ''Recreation'' as Sarge, Caboose and Grif go to the desert. In the Chorus Trilogy, Tucker's evolution into a capable leader and combatant is a major theme, as he helps stop the Chorus Civil War, fend off the invaders who played both sides, and eventually wear The Meta's armor in a last stand against Charon Industries' troops.\n\nIn Season 15 and 16, Tucker has to deal with responsibility (he is forced to pay child support for several illegitimate children after impregnating several women on Chorus, and his recklessness to fight the Zealots guns blazing causes Washington to get shot) and egotism (he tries much to impress Sister, even becoming king of [[Camelot]], which he renames \"Camelto\", until she calls out on Tucker's inflated image of himself).\n\n====Caboose====\n[[Captain (armed forces)|Captain]] Michael J. Caboose ([[Joel Heyman]]) first appears in Episode 3 of {{rvbep|Season 1}} as a new recruit for the {{rvbchar|Blue Team}}. He is portrayed as one of the more eccentric characters in the series, with behavior varying from merely somewhat dim-witted in Season 1 to almost completely divorced from reality from Season 3 onward. This is most likely due to Omega ('O'Malley') possessing him in Season 1 and permanently damaging his mental faculties after he left. It is stated that Tucker and Church once \"rebooted\" his armor, causing his life support systems to shut down - including his oxygen supply, leading to brain damage that hindered Caboose's mental state. Despite his shortcomings, he is arguably the most genuinely loyal character and frequently displays above-average physical strength, which Church and Tucker describe as \"God's way of compensating\". He also shows some knowledge of machinery, being able to transfer Epsilon from a storage unit to a Monitor in ''Recreation'' and being able to revive a Mantis Droid in Season 11, who Caboose renamed \"Freckles\".\n\nHis unusual behavior frequently earns him scorn and disrespect from the other characters. It is a running gag that Caboose either injures or kills anyone that he attempts to help, starting with the death of Church in the eighth episode of the series. In season 13, Freckles' memory chip is placed in Caboose's Assault Rifle to prevent him from shooting others, as whenever Caboose pulls the trigger, it instead fires confetti.\n\nEver since ''Reconstruction'', Caboose wears a Mark V Mjolnir helmet, instead of Mark VI. This was done to make him easier to differentiate from Church, as their shades of blue look too similar on ''Halo 3'', and also because the producers felt the Mark V's simplistic helmet design  better suited Caboose's personality.\n\nDuring Season 15, Caboose does not believe Church is truly gone, thinking people come back to life if you care about them. Upon meeting the Blues and Reds, Caboose begins a friendship with his counterpart Loco. After being shown during imprisonment that the distress call from Church was a ruse, Caboose finally begins to accept that Church is truly gone. In the finale, Loco's machine opens a time portal to Blood Gulch, allowing Caboose to say goodbye to a confused Church.\n\nIn part due to positive early fan reaction, [[Burnie Burns]], the main writer for the series, focused the storyline on Caboose and {{rvbchar|Donut}} ([[Dan Godwin]]), the Red Team's rookie. In an early episode of the Rooster Teeth Podcast, Joel Heyman, Caboose's voice actor, revealed that his motivation for the character was that Caboose is \"the only character who is aware that he's in a video game.\" Heyman also explained during [[RTX (event)|RTX]] 2017 that Caboose's childish speech is because he \"treats everything as if it was an animal\". Caboose will not hesitate to shoot a \"friend\" if he is asked to \"help\" them.\n\n====Freckles====\n'''Freckles''' (originally voiced by Shane Newville) was an HRUNTING/YGGDRASIL Mark IX \"Mantis\" battle robot that was activated by Caboose, who later took him as a pet. After the Reds and Blues crash landed in an unknown location, in Season 11, Caboose discovered the damaged robot hidden in a cave and successfully repaired it. \"Freckles\", named so due to the spots on his face, caused great unease to everyone on both teams, as Freckles obeyed Caboose's every whim, according him the respect due a superior officer. This included the robot acting as Caboose's military-justice enforcer when Washington (accidentally) gave command of the team to Caboose through a poor choice of words during a heated argument. During Caboose's tenure as team leader, everyone did as he said because otherwise Freckles would find them guilty of disobeying a superior officer in a time of war and issue the appropriate punishment: execution. Caboose eventually gave control of Freckles to Agent Washington when the two reconciled. He ended up destroyed during a strike by Locus and the Federal Army of Chorus.\n\nIn Season 12, Locus gave to the Reds and Blues the only reminder of Freckles, a memory chip, which turned out to have a tracker device on it. This was removed, and then the A.I. was placed into Caboose's Assault Rifle, which when combined with the gun's smart scope and stabilizer system, allowed Freckles to direct the gun to take out targets with efficiency. In Season 13, Freckles' ammunition was alternated with confetti, whenever Caboose pulls the trigger on his gun to prevent his constant injuries to teammates, and bullets when the robot was in control. This even helped the defeat of Felix once the mercenary attempted to fire with Caboose's rifle, only for confetti to come out and Freckles to recoil the gun into Felix's face.\n\nIn Season 15, Freckles (now voiced by Miles Luna) gets a new Mantis body, however a miniature one that barely reaches the characters' knees.\n\n====Sister====\n'''Kaikaina \"Sister\" Grif''' (Rebecca Frasier) is Grif's younger sister, who wears yellow armor. Her given name is even [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] for younger sibling, albeit of the same sex (a sister to a male is \"kaikuahine\"). She was taken care of by Grif once their mother left for the circus - being both the fat lady and the [[bearded lady]] - and once he joined the army, Sister decided to enlist as well. She was brought into Blood Gulch on season 5, with her ship landing in the middle of the canyon and explaining Command had sent her as a new recruit since one team member will be promoted to replace their deceased commanding officer. However, in following episodes she is revealed to be [[colorblind]] and is actually part of Blue team. Sister then joins the Blues, initially entering conflicts with Tex but then bonding.\n\nSister is noted for her stupidity, promiscuity, and disturbing revelations - sometimes of a sexual nature - that other characters comment with \"Yeah. Wait, what?\", such as that she attempted to overdose on Aspirin and [[female ejaculation|has the ability to ejaculate]].\n\nSister is the only remaining Blue soldier in the canyon come ''Reconstruction''. With the conflict stuck in a stalemate, as Sarge cannot bring himself into attacking a woman, she throws raves every night and refuses to give Washington information, believing he is a cop. After Sarge leaves to go after Grif and Simmons, Lopez strangles Sister to ensure the Reds' victory, before departing himself. However, she ends up surviving, as revealed in a cameo during Season 13. In season 15, Sister is revealed to organize events such as festivals and conventions on Blood Gulch to make usage of the abandoned bases. By the end of the season, she is reunited with her brother once the New Republic troops, who she met while in a business meeting on Chorus, arrive to check on the Reds and Blues, officially rejoining the main cast. In ''The Shisno Paradox'', Sister is paired with Tucker in time travelling misadventures, mostly regarding Sister's intent to have sex with past celebrities.\n\nAlthough Rebecca Frasier was a good friend of the Rooster Teeth production crew, Burnie Burns intended to allow other women to audition for the role of Sister despite the pressure of the other members. He notes two other girls auditioned for the role before Frasier was given her chance, but when she began auditioning the team made something of a joke out of the audition, slipping in increasingly more vulgar lines to see how far Frasier would go before refusing to read them. Upon realizing she had no such limits, Frasier was cast as Sister and the role was re-written as a far more promiscuous character to fit with the lines she had read in the audition.<ref name=\"S5DVDComm\">Rooster Teeth Productions (2007). Audio commentary. In [[Red vs. Blue Season Five]] [DVD]. Buda, Texas: Rooster Teeth Productions.</ref>\n\n===Former Freelancer Agents===\n====Carolina====\n'''Agent Carolina''' (Jen Brown) is a defected member of Project Freelancer, who was believed dead after The Meta threw her off a cliff after stealing her two AI units, but is revealed to be alive at the end of Season 9. Carolina turns out to have recruited the Reds and Blues to retrieve Epsilon so he could lead her to Project Freelancer's director, who she intends to kill.\nDuring the flashbacks of Seasons 9 and 10, Carolina is revealed to have been the top Freelancer agent until Tex arrived. For being extremely competitive against Tex, even willing to risk the mission's completion in order to best her rival, Carolina ends up becoming bitter and easily-angered, which drives her Freelancer partners away. Still, in spite of initially being obsessed with killing the Director, once Carolina finds him by the end of Season 10, she only confronts Dr. Church and calls out on his behavior, in a way that also reveals to the viewer that the director is Carolina's father. She is a proficient fighter, and has many enhancements in her armor, such as active camouflage and speed boost.\n\nAlongside Epsilon, Carolina is absent from Season 11, returning halfway through Season 12 to reveal that in her search for Freelancer-based equipment, she uncovered the conspiracy taking place on planet Chorus, leading the Reds and Blues on a mission to expose the mercenaries and the corporation that were keeping the planet in a civil war. In Season 15, Carolina is revealed to have, along with Tex, triggered Temple's wish to take down Project Freelancer and the UNSC, as a fight between both during a [[capture the flag]] match in Desert Gulch killed Temple's friend Biff. Even if weakened by spending days paralyzed with her armor locked, Carolina helped the Reds and Blues defeat Temple. In ''The Shisno Paradox'' Carolina leaves for Chorus to check on the recovery of the hospitalized Washington, but without revealing him about his brain damage. She eventually rejoins the Reds and Blues and goes with them to the past trying to prevent Wash from getting wounded in the first place.\n\n====Wash====\nA former member of Project Freelancer, '''Agent Washington''', also known as \"Wash\", true name David ([[Shannon McCormick]]), is infamous for an incident in his past where his AI, Epsilon, malfunctioned while still in his system. According to Washington, Epsilon's mind allegedly broke down and the AI would later \"commit suicide\" while still in Washington's head. This left his sanity questionable and as a result of the accident, Washington distrusts AI constructs, which made him fit for the Recovery Program as his commanders knew he would not take the retrieved AI for himself.\n\nHe is introduced as the main protagonist of the mini-series ''Recovery One'', where he is sent to go after dead Freelancers in hope to retrieving their AI. Wash returns in ''Reconstruction'', where to go after the Meta, he ends up recruiting the Reds and Blues given they had experience with an AI, O'Malley. After destroying the Meta's AI in the season finale with an EMP, Wash is imprisoned by the UNSC due to him destroying protected classified military property . But in ''Recreation'', he was offered freedom in exchange for the retrieval of the Epsilon AI while assisted by the Meta, causing Wash to turn against the Red and Blue teams due to Caboose not taking Epsilon to the authorities and keeping him and Sarge deleting the Blue team from all records and even shoot Lopez and Donut dead. However by ''Revelation'', upon capturing a copy of the Tex AI, The Meta betrays Washington in order to pursue his original goal of gaining the full Alpha AI. Wash is subsequently injured by The Meta and saved by the Red and Blue teams. He fakes his death and joins the Blue Team, wearing Church's armor with his original yellow trim, so as to not be caught by authorities.\n\nIn Season 10 it is revealed that Wash essentially replaces Church on the Blue Team to remain incognito, and throughout the season he is loyal to Carolina despite not agreeing with most of her methods, eventually coming to her rescue on the Director's base alongside the Reds and Blues. In Chapter 6, Wash was shown without his helmet, however only the back of his head was shown, revealing that he has spikey blonde hair.\n\nIn Season 11, Wash assumes command of Blue Team as they try living stranded following a shipwreck. After their base is attacked by the Federal Army of Chorus, Wash sacrifices himself and orders Freckles to collapse the cave leading to the New Republic base and is knocked out and captured by Locus seconds later. After being reunited with the other Reds and Blues the following season, Wash helps them in their mission to drive away the mercenaries attacking the planet, entering particular conflicts with Locus, who considers Washington to have lost his value as a soldier.\n\nIn Season 15, Wash and Carolina separate from the Reds and Blues to investigate on the death of other Freelancers. They are still reunited with the Reds and Blues and meet the Blues and Reds, with their leader Temple secretly traps them in armor lock mode in a room full of Freelancers who fell victim as well. After days paralyzed, which caused extreme fatigue even caused him to hallucinate, Wash is released by Locus, and due to his hindered mental state is shot in the throat when he wanders into a battlefield. Locus promptly puts him onboard his ship, and goes to get Wash medical attention on Chorus. ''The Shisno Paradox'' reveals the injury resulted in Wash suffering from [[cerebral hypoxia]], giving him bouts of frustration and short-term memory loss, as well as being unable to recall the events of Season 15. After regrouping with the Reds and Blues, Wash is unaware of his condition until Carolina reveals it to him. Enraged, Wash storms off. Frustrated, the Reds and Blues time travel to prevent Wash from being shot in the first place, causing a [[temporal paradox]] that breaks reality.\n\nIn Singularity Wash has, as subject of the paradox, had his history rewritten and is left oscillating between the delusional state he was in prior to being shot and the sane man he was after his treatment. Wash\u2019s complaining about his non-existent neck wound to Doctor Grey inspired her to commit a massive insurance fraud against the UNSC, splitting the compensation between Wash and herself. Wash used the money to make nonsensical business deals, such as using cannons for funerals. Donut arrives and fixes Wash\u2019s oscillation, and explains Chrovos\u2019s plan. Washington suggests stopping the paradox, but Genkins steals the time travel gun.\n\nIn the flashbacks of Season 9 and 10, Washington is shown to be naive and neurotic, much like the Reds and Blues. However the encounter with Epsilon hardened him, making him a considerably more serious and skilled character throughout ''The Recollection''. Although Washington is not as skilled in combat as higher-ranked freelancers such as Carolina, he is nevertheless a formidable opponent in a fight, managing to take down a UNSC Hornet single-handedly, and battle against the likes of Tex, The Meta, and Locus.\n\n===Chorus War===\n====Locus====\nA mercenary associated with a band of Space Pirates, '''Locus''' ([[Gray Haddock]]), whose real name is revealed in Season 14 to be Samuel Ortez, was hired by Charon Industries to play off one of the sides in the Chorus Civil War, the Federal Army of Chorus. He is named after an eponymous suit of armor, and has a [[cloaking device]] that allows him to become invisible.\n\nLocus' introduction in season 11 had him spying on the Reds and Blues, and later killing the pilot that dropped off Doc, Donut, and Lopez. Once he sees Felix talking to the group, he decides to recruits soldiers to attack the crash site. In the ensuing battle, he personally incapacitates and captures Donut, Wash, Lopez, and Sarge. In the next season, New Republic leader Kimball reveals to Tucker that Felix and Locus were in fact friends and fought alongside each other, but the war changed them both so much they could not face returning to civilian life. Felix teamed up with the Chorus rebels and, out of rivalry, Locus joined the FAC to finally find out which one of them is the better. However, Felix's betrayal later in the season reveals the last part was a ruse: Locus and Felix were hired to play both sides of the Chorus war to wipe out the population for an organization (Control) that intends to use Chorus for their own purposes.\n\nDuring Season 13, a portal in a temple reveals a part of Locus' past: the squad in which he and Felix fought found an Alien, Locus refused to kill him, only take it prisoner, which led the commanding officer to yell at Locus, saying him that he was nothing more than a suit of armor and a gun who should follow orders without question. Traumatized by having his values shattered in front of him, Locus decides to become what his superior demanded, a living weapon that carried out all orders regardless of their consequences. Still, once Locus realizes he has become less a soldier than a monster, and discovers Felix was afraid of Locus himself, Locus refuse to aid Felix, leading to the latter's death. Locus vows to the Reds and Blues to amend his wrongs, but proclaims that he will not do it from a cell, while leaving them behind.\n\nIn Season 15, Locus who was making up for his past sins, Locus swore off killing and began seeking ways to use his skills to help others. Approximately ten months later, Locus discovered a refugee colony with their power generator stolen by the Blues and Reds resulting in their deaths. While looking for the terrorists he finds Lopez head floating in space heading to a black hole while asking for help. Locus joins up with Lopez and Grif to save the Reds and Blues. While Grif distracts the Blues and Reds, Locus saves Washington and Carolina. He then meets up with Sarge to free the rest of the group. After Wash is wounded, Locus takes him aboard his ship to receive medical attention on Chorus. During the next season, Locus tries to contact the Reds and Blues with an urgent message, but Grif, who wanted to avoid anything that could lead to further adventures, crashed the ship before learning what Locus wanted.\n\n====Felix====\n'''Felix''' (Miles Luna), real name Isaac Gates, first appears in [[Red vs. Blue: Season 11|Season 11]], observing the Blue Team and noticing that Locus is nearby. Felix saves Wash from being shot by Locus with a hardlight shield, but is himself hit in the leg. After Locus flees, Doc manages to heal Felix, who reveals he is a mercenary working with the New Republic that is fighting on the planet of Chorus, a planet forgotten about by the [[Factions of Halo|UNSC]] during the war against the aliens, and requires the help of the Reds and Blues. Although reluctant, the Reds and Blues eventually agree to help.\n\nDuring Season 12, Felix inspects the training Tucker, Simmons, Grif and Caboose provide to the New Republic troops, and reveals while a mercenary, his only payment is on alien technology he hopes to sell in the black market. Once he appears in the Federal Army's compound where the Reds and Blues reunited, Felix reveals himself to be a sadistic, manipulative [[psychopath]], who was working alongside Locus to keep prolonging the war on Chorus for an organization that intends to use Chorus for their own purposes. His intentions are revealed to the New Republic once Tucker records Felix gloating about his plans and broadcasts it to the troops that were fighting on the Chorus capital Armonia.\n\nIn Season 13, Felix and Locus decide to even the odds by raiding the UNSC ''Tartarus'', kill the crew members and \"recruit\" several of its prisoners, including the Counselor and Sharkface. After the Reds and Blues activate the planet's dormant alien technology, Felix learns about the Purge tower, that could kill everyone on Chorus. He goes for the Great Key that could activate the Purge, but Doyle beats him to it. Felix retrieves the Key, only to discover it will only work for Doyle until he dies, leading to an attack on Armonia that kills the General. Felix and Locus then head for the Purge tower, where Wash and Carolina waited. After a long and brutal fight, the Freelancers inform the two that they were simply stalling them, and then the ''Tartarus'' is brought down with a tractor beam into the tower, destroying it.\n\nEnraged, Felix flies himself and Locus to the Comm Temple in their damaged Falcon, furiously wanting to kill the Blood Gulch Crew. Locus eventually decides he had enough of Felix and refuses to aid him, leading Simmons and Tucker to blast Felix off the tower. Locus proceeds to pick up the discarded Key and activates the sword, proving the previous wielder was dead.\n\n====The Chairman====\n'''Chairman Malcolm Hargrove''' (Jack Lee), also known as '''Control''', is the head of Charon Industries, a company which specializes in military hardware. Hargrove is also the Chairman of the UNSC Oversight Sub-Committee  He is introduced in ''Reconstruction'' through messages exchanged between himself and Director Leonard Church, of Project Freelancer, with the Chairman suspecting him of criminal acts with his experiments, and eventually presses charges against the Director and sends officers to place him under arrest. He returns in ''Recreation'' to talk with Washington, striking a deal to free him in exchange for the Epsilon AI.\n\nIn the finale of season 12, the Reds and Blues acknowledge his true identity as the leader of the corporation financing the Chorus Civil War. He then receives a threat from them, after which we learn that he is in possession of the Meta's helmet. By the next season, it is further revealed that Charon is selling Alien technology on the black market, and once the Reds and Blues expose Hargrove's crimes is exposed, he arrives on Chorus, declaring if he is going down, then so will the inhabitants and the Space Pirates. Hargrove later confronts the Reds and Blues on a video screen aboard the ''Staff of Charon''. Season 15 reveals that Hargrove was defeated and arrested.\n\n====Sheila/F.I.L.S.S.====\n'''Sheila''' ([[Yomary Cruz]]) is one of the many copies of the '''F.I.L.S.S.''' (Freelancer Integrated Logistics and Security System, pronounced \"Phyllis\", and also voiced by Cruz) AI. In The Blood Gulch Chronicles Sheila appears primarily as the [[artificial intelligence|AI]] of the Blue Team's tank. In seasons 9-10, the original F.I.L.S.S. system is shown running training programs, security and databases. Unlike the Alpha, Sheila/F.I.L.S.S. is not a \"smart AI\", meaning that she was programmed rather than based on a person. She is usually friendly and cheerful but sometimes defensive.\n\nIn Season 1, Sheila is driven by Caboose, and accidentally kills his teammate, Church, due to a combination of [[Radar lock-on|locked-on]] targeting and disabled [[friendly fire]] protocol, before being herself \"killed\" after Sarge orders a bombing. Tex fixes Sheila and attacks Red Base, but is then, this becomes a running joke in the series. Sheila initially shows some indications of liking Caboose. However, in the middle of Season 2, she falls in love with Lopez, much to Caboose's dislike. Later, the two attempt to lead a robot revolution against the humans in response to the abuse they have received from constantly being blown up and possessed by ghosts. When Church goes \"back in time\", he attempts to stop himself from being killed. When he encounters Sheila she calls herself F.I.L.S.S. This confuses Church, she then asks if he would like her to change her name to Sheila, which she does. It is also revealed that the robot revolution idea stemmed from Church's attempt to intervene. After O'Malley kidnaps Lopez, she starts assisting the teams again.\n\nSheila remains behind on Blood Gulch while the Reds and Blues leave to pursue O'Malley through the teleporter. After a brief conversation with a \"[[time travel|time-travel]]ing\" Church, Sheila powers down. She is the source of the distress signal that the Reds hear in Season 3. A deleted scene from Season 4 confirms that she sent out the distress signal with a disguised voice. In addition, all of the Reds except Sarge see her drive past Red Base. When Sarge demotes Simmons for his talk about \"imaginary\" tanks, she helps Simmons attempt his revenge on the Reds, and is unable to recognize the team as her enemies due to faltering [[memory]] units. In a deleted scene from Season 4, she expresses dissatisfaction when Church collects all the vehicles available to the Blue Base in Blood Gulch, while Church perceives her reaction as jealousy.\n\nIn Season 5, Church notes that Sheila has been acting aggressive lately and saying \"random threatening things.\" They suspect that O'Malley could be possessing her and she is shut down. Tex explained that the tank was too damaged to be reactivated, so they transfer Sheila's AI into the ship that Sister had arrived in. She is pleasantly surprised by the roominess of her new home, and later tells Caboose that O'Malley has moved into the Blue leader (Captain Flowers). Her tank body is then taken over by the AI Gamma. Later they link the ship up to the tank and she locks Gamma behind a firewall.\n\nCaboose tells the other Blues in {{rvbep|54|Episode 54}} that Andy knew Sheila from a previous encounter. The Season 4 commentary states that Andy was originally to be Sheila's ex-boyfriend, but this idea was not used.<ref name=\"S4DVDComment\">Rooster Teeth Productions (2006). Audio commentary.

However, it is revealed in ''Reconstruction'' that Sheila survived the explosion and is still present within the crashed ship. As a result of the explosion, she is damaged and functions at minimal capacity, stuttering when speaking. Later in ''Relocated'' Caboose is seen taking parts from the ship. In ''Revelation'' she occupies an abandoned Freelancer facility where the Reds and Blues travel. After constantly being called Sheila, she begins to respond to that name as well.\n\nIn Project Freelancer, F.I.L.S.S. assisted the Director on the flagship ''Mother of Invention'' and various other freelancer bases. She appears to be a close companion of the Freelancers as they greet her when they return from their missions. One subroutine becomes Sheila the tank. In ''Season 10'', in the present day, the same abandoned facility from earlier had become Director's hideout. There she spends her days constantly repeating a video of Allison. After Carolina and Church left the Director, he ordered F.I.L.S.S. to delete everything, including her, except the video. Before deletion, they both express the honor of serving each other.\n\nIn Season 12's finale, F.I.L.S.S. is shown to be functional and working for Chairman Hargrove, though sounding more depressed and reluctant in her duties. In the conclusion of Season 13, F.I.L.S.S is discovered by the Reds and Blues on the ship Staff of Charon, where she reveals she has been working under duress, and aids the Reds and Blues in their plot to expose Hargrove.\n\n====Sharkface====\n'''Sharkface''' (David Jennison) first appears in ''Season 9'', Chapter 13. In the following chapter, when the Freelancers attack a building, he is ordered to lead a squad up to the vault to kill the Freelancers. Carolina and Washington are about to leave the vault when the door is opened and the Flame Soldier appears. The two Freelancers, confused by his bold entrance, are forced to take cover as he begins to fire a flamethrower. After a tough fight, Carolina, jumps onto a Banshee suspended from the ceiling, tosses a grenade and kicks off it. The grenade explodes sending the Banshee flying into the Flame Soldier. To their surprise, the Flame Soldier takes the hit and begins to get up, but Carolina throws a Gravity Hammer at his head, rendering him unconscious.\n\nIn the first episode of Season 13, Sharkface is seen for a brief moment in a prison cell on a giant prison transport ship, the ''Tartarus''. Later in the episode, he is seen getting released and recruited by Felix and Locus, due to his past experience with the Freelancers. The Insurrection Flame Soldier, now known as Sharkface due to the tattoos of his old Insurrection personality and the left side of his face being covered by scar tissue, explains to the Counselor that they left him for dead, dropped a building on him, and killed all his friends. He is also seen spray painting his helmet and gun with the gun receiving the shark decal instead of his helmet. The Counselor has numerous therapeutic sessions with Sharkface where he vividly expressed his hatred of the Freelancers. He successfully defeats Carolina after Epsilon fails to maintain her armor upgrades and constantly butts heads with Felix. He puts himself on a warpath against Carolina and Wash which gets him killed. After being defeated by Carolina, he vowed that he will hunt Agents Carolina and Washington, no matter what they do to him. With that said, he is swiftly executed by Agent Washington and Vannessa Kimball. His corpse is destroyed as Doyle blows up Armonia.\n\n====The Counselor====\n'''Counselor Aiden Price''' (Asaf Ronen) was a high-ranking member of the Freelancer Project. The Counselor first appears in a flashback during Part 4 of ''Recovery One'', where he interrogates Agent Washington about the failure of the Epsilon AI and informs him he is a candidate for Recovery. His next appearance is in ''Reconstruction'', where he appears on a monitor and interrogates Pvt. Henderson before speaking to Agent Washington about The Meta. He also speaks briefly with Washington in Chapter 19 and attempts to negotiate with The Meta. He is also seen during a flashback in ''Recreation'' debriefing Donut after his transfer from Blood Gulch. He typically speaks in a very soft voice, and tries to calm those he is speaking to. The Counselor appears in the flashback portions of ''Season 9'' and ''Season 10'' where he frequently advises against some of the Director's more erratic actions, but is usually ignored, the Director even going so far as saying \"Shut up Counselor\".\n\nIn ''Prologue'' (the first episode of ''Season 13''), it is revealed the Counselor is being held on the UNSC prison ship ''Tartarus'' in transit for transport to an unknown facility. When the ship is raided by Felix and Locus, he offers his knowledge of the Freelancers project, showing bitterness to Agents Washington and Carolina. In episode 18 the Counselor is killed when the ''Tartarus'' crash lands on Chorus.\n\n====Kimball====\nVanessa Kimball ([[Lindsay Jones (actress)|Lindsay Jones]]) is the idealist leader of the Chorusian New Republic, who takes in Simmons, Grif, Tucker and Caboose after the Federal Army attacks the Reds and Blues. When Felix lies to her and tells her that the Reds and Blues were killed, he manages to convince Kimball to go to the capital Armonia with her soldiers. However, they end up trapped inside the capital by the Federal Army, only stopping once the Reds and Blues reveal Felix's confession of his true intentions and allegiance to Control, which even had him bragging about playing Kimball, to her disgust. Kimball and Doyle both order their troops to stand down.\nIn the next season, both continue to bicker regarding the way to lead the armies in their fight against Charon, until Doyle confesses he admires Vanessa's courage, and then the General's sacrifice inspires Kimball to convince the factions to solve their differences. She leads the attack on the Communication Temple that would allow the Reds and Blues to expose Charon to the universe.\n\nIn Season 15, Kimball is revealed to have become the president of a united Chorus, currently under siege by UNSC troops.\n\n==== Doyle====\nGeneral Donald Doyle ([[Gray Haddock]]) was the leader of the Federal Army of Chorus. Originally a secretary for a brigadier general, he became the FAC leader after previous leaders either left or died during the Chorus Civil War. He is shown to be extremely cowardly when it came to combat situations. Still, he decided to retrieve an energy sword that would allow the mercenaries to kill all of Chorus, and later sacrifices himself by manually attaching an explosive to Armonia's nuclear reactor in an attempt to kill all space pirates who had invaded the Chorus capital. In season 15 a memorial hospital was built and named General Doyle General Hospital.\n\n====The Lieutenants====\nOnce the New Republic decides to have Caboose, Grif, Simmons, and Tucker instruct their troops, they are named captains and given each a squad to lead. At a certain point, each has to promote one soldier to be their lieutenants in a rescue mission.\n\nFrom Caboose's Blue Team comes Lt. John Elizabeth Andersmith \"Smith\" (Ryan Haywood), a disciplined and blindingly loyal recruit, who believes that Caboose is an extremely wise and great leader, shocking the others. Smith's middle name is a reference to ''[[The Producers (1967 film)|The Producers]]''<ref>[http://milesluna.tumblr.com/post/98767808777/tvckingtons-i-really-wanna-know-if-that Miles Luna's Twitter]</ref> and the full surname, to a fake dead soldier in a lie told by the Blues in Season 9 to keep Tex in Blood Gulch.\n\nEven if the sycophanthic Matthews (Kyle Taylor) attempts to become the Orange Team's choice in the rescue mission, Grif promotes Lt. Antoine Bitters (Brandon Farmahini), who, like his superior, has a lazy and pessimistic attitude, who Grif likes for being a \"total maverick\".\n\nSimmons' Red Team only has women, something that bothers him. He chooses the one who makes him the less nervous, Lt. Katie Jensen ([[Barbara Dunkelman]]), who like Simmons is intellectual, loyal and socially awkward, going as far as choking in her own saliva when attempting to introduce herself. Jensen speaks with a heavy [[lisp]], which during RTX 2018 was revealed to be inspired by a character Dunkelman created in college, and in Season 13 turns out to be a dangerous driver who constantly destroys vehicles.\n\nAfter Tucker's Green Team is mostly killed in a mission, the only survivor is the one Tucker resents the most, and thus earns a promotion, Lt. Charles Palomo (Kerry Shawcross). Like Tucker, Palomo is immodest and perverted, although he manages to eventually gain the affection of Jensen, and by Season 15 both are dating.\n\n====Santa====\nSanta (Adam Ellis), named so by Caboose for [[Santa Claus|being red and \"bearing gifts\"]], is an alien AI construct who inhabits and guards the ancient temples of Chorus. He first appears when Tucker activates his sword before the Temple of Arms, knowing it was a key built by its creators that could activate the temples. Santa then deactivates the facility, and  proceeds to test anyone who entered the temples with illusions that show their greatest fears in search for \"a true warrior of  mental clarity and strength\", which turns out to be Caboose, who is not intimidated by Santa's ordeal. After Caboose exits, Santa introduces himself as an AI left behind to protect gifts from his creators, which range from alien weaponry to communications centers. At first he refuses to take part in the Chorus Civil War, but eventually backs the natives after realizing that the Space Pirates intend on selling the technology.\n\nIn Season 15, Santa is revealed to have become an assistant to President Kimball, checking on whoever visits her to see if they lie.\n\n==== Dr. Grey ====\nDr. Emily Grey (Arryn Zech) is a surgeon originally in the Federal Army of Chorus, who in spite of remarkable medical skills is mentally unstable, always talking in a cheerful manner even when discussing morbid subjects. Introduced recovering Washington following the battle that led to his capture, Grey is eventually transported along with the Blood Gulch Crew by getting caught in the radius of a Teleportation Cube utilized by Carolina. There, she treats Carolina's wound, and helps the group learn more about Locus and Felix's plans by interrogates a pirate who follows the group through torture and mutilation.\n\nA month later, as the civil war is changed to a fight between Chorus and Charon Industries, Dr. Grey goes with Epsilon and Carolina to gain more info on a nearby alien temple. She is present after Caboose manages to uncover the AI inside the temple, even ordering Freckles to kill the pirates who appear after the group, and as Doc is discovered in a cave. Upon their return to Armonia,  Grey quickly becomes interested in Doc's split personality and chases him around the city to perform [[electroshock therapy]] on him. Later on, the Space Pirates attack the city, forcing Grey to take refuge inside the hospital. As the pirates attack the hospital, Grey is luckily saved by Smith, Jensen, Palomo, and Bitters, who inform her that they are evacuating the city. Along with the lieutenants, she infiltrates Crash Site Alpha and activate the tractor beam that brings down the ''Tartarus'', destroying it and the Purge Temple on the impact.\n\nIn Season 15, Dr. Grey is revealed to be the head surgeon of General Doyle General Hospital, patching up Jax Jones and giving his boss Dylan Andrews the name of the UNSC diplomat that could help her arrange a meeting with Kimball. Grey also treats Washington's neck wound, and in the next season discusses the resulting injuries with Carolina, who had become worried by her partner's memory lapses.\n\n=== Blues And Reds ===\n==== Temple ====\n'''Mark Temple''' (Andrew Matthews) is Church's counterpart, and the leader of the Blues and Reds, the group attacking the UNSC. After his friend Biff (Mac Blake), a Grif equivalent, was accidentally killed during a capture the flag game featuring Carolina and Tex,  he swore revenge upon the UNSC and Project Freelancer. He started killing everyone involved in the project, with agents in particular being lured to a secret room where Temple locked them in their armor, a fate Temple bestows on Wash and Carolina while revealing his vendetta.\n\nUnlike Church, Temple is a caring, kind, and capable leader with much respect for others, but they are both terrible shots with the sniper rifle. In reality, Temple is a manipulative and sadistic individual more than willing to murder anyone who gets in his way, while Church was willing to sacrifice himself on numerous occasions (and actually ''has'', twice). Temple is revealed to have planned to use a specialized drill that runs on temporal power to destroy the UNSC headquarters, unaware that doing so would endanger the entire planet, and possibly the universe, due to breaking the laws of physics and possibly opening a tear in reality. When confronted by the Reds and Blues with this information, he stubbornly refuses to believe it, insisting that they simply wish to keep him from destroying the UNSC and achieving the vengeance he seeks for the death of his longtime friend Biff. Temple is knocked unconscious by Tucker, and is seen in a mid-credits scene imprisoned with the surviving Blues and Reds.\n\n==== Buckey ====\nBuckey (Dallas Reid) is Tucker's counterpart in the Blues and Reds. Much like Tucker, Buckey is extremely perverted, even having his own version of Tucker's \"Bow Chicka Bow Wow!\" catchphrase, \"Boom Chicka Wah Wah!\" After the Reds and Blues are captured, Buckey takes Tucker's sword, despite knowing it only works for Tucker. When the Reds and Blues try to stop Loco's machine, Buckey goes into a one-on-one battle with Tucker which end with Tucker knocking Buckey unconscious and recovering his sword. Buckey is seen in a mid-credits scene imprisoned with the surviving Blues and Reds.\n\n==== Loco ====\nLoco (Kirk Johnson) is Caboose's Blues and Reds counterpart, with a name alluding to [[locomotive]] to contrast the original being [[caboose|the last wagon]]. Loco is like Caboose in almost every way, even having the same intelligence. Loco also has a knack for engineering, according to Temple. He is also the only member of the Blues and Reds to actually like the Reds and Blues, forming a deep friendship with Caboose. Loco also creates a time machine/laser drill that will cause a black hole that will destroy Earth. After activating the machine, Loco gets Caboose batteries to fix Freckles, but is accidentally shot by Temple. Loco gives Caboose the batteries, before revealing that his machine will allow Caboose to say goodbye to Church. Loco then dies of his wounds. ''The Shisno Paradox'' reveals that he had gained the knowledge to build the time machine from Chrovos under unknown circumstances, as part of his plan to destroy the timeline.\n\n==== Surge ====\nColonel Surge ([[Kent Williams (voice actor)|Kent Williams]]) is Sarge's Blues and Reds counterpart. While they are similar in personality, they have a differing taste in weapons, with Surge preferring a [[railgun]] as opposed to a shotgun. During the Blues and Reds invasion of Earth, Surge is the most concerned with killing the Reds and Blues. After Loco's machine is activated, Surge and Sarge get into a one-on-one battle. Sarge tries to get Surge to turn against Temple, but accidentally causes Surge to fall into an incinerator.\n\n==== Gene ====\nGene (Sorola) is Simmons' Blues and Reds counterpart, named as in\u2013joke to [[Gene Simmons]]. Unlike the other Blues and Reds, Gene is identical to Simmons in every way, with even their voices being the same. After Loco activates his machine, Gene, now with a gold visor, attacks Grif and Simmons. Grif is at first unable to tell them apart, but gets Gene to reveal himself by asking the question \"Why are we here\" which Gene responses with (We need to stop these evil guys , that's why!) while Simmons response with (We don't know why we're here. It's still one of life's great mysteries, isn't it?) . Grif promptly shoots Gene, who stumble over a catwalk and is left hanging precariously over a lava flow.\n\n==== Cronut ====\nCronut (Luna) is Donut's counterpart, also named after [[cronut|a pastry]]. Like Donut, Cronut often nearly dies, and has a dislike of his armor being called pink, instead preferring \"reddish-white.\"  Cronut also frequently makes innuendos. When the Blues and Reds arrive on Earth, Cronut and Lorenzo are sent to kill the Reds and Blues in a tank. Tucker quickly decapitates Lorenzo, and causes the tank to explode with Cronut still inside. It's later revealed that Cronut managed to survive, and was imprisoned along with the other surviving Blues and Reds.\n\n==== Lorenzo ====\nLorenzo (Burns) is Lopez's counterpart, a robot that can only speak Italian. When the Blues and Reds arrive on Earth, Lorenzo and Cronut are sent in a tank to kill them. Tucker jumps on the tank and decapitates Lorenzo, who was serving as the gunner, and kicks his head into the distance vowing vendetta . Lorenzo's body is destroyed when the tank explodes.\n\n====Doc====\n[[Combat medic|Medical]] Officer Frank \"Doc\" Dufresne ([[Matt Hullum]]), nicknamed as such because Church could not pronounce his surname, is a [[medic]] first sent to Blood Gulch to treat both armies, despite the lack of medical skill that he often displays. He is not a qualified doctor, having failed [[medical school]] at Jamaica State, and his lack of medical knowledge is apparent. In one case he rubs Caboose's neck with [[aloe|aloe vera]] to treat a bullet wound in the foot, and he agrees with Grif's using [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] to treat the bullet wound to the head. He also has no idea what his medical tool (portrayed by ''Halo'''s Plasma Pistol) does.\n\nDoc is also a [[pacifism|pacifist]] of the most extreme kind, and tries to avoid doing or even saying anything that would seem remotely aggressive or competitive. As revealed in the bonus material on the Season 3 DVD, this pacifism had caused him to be released from the Red Army before the events of ''The Blood Gulch Chronicles'', thereby necessitating the draft that forced Grif into military service. The profile also states he is the only person in history to enlist in an army as a 'conscientious objector'.<ref name=\"S3DVDProfiles\" /> Doc's incompetence drew the ire of both teams, leading him to hide in a cave. There O'Malley found Doc and possessed him, and the personality clashes \u2013 the aggressive megalomaniac AI against the meek apologetic host \u2013 lead to frequent arguments between O'Malley and Doc. After going into hiding following O'Malley's defeat at the end of Season 3, Doc returns in {{rvbep|73}} because Church needed a medical assessment of Tucker. In Episode 77, O'Malley leaves Doc after the Reds, unaware of his presence, contact Command via radio. Free of O'Malley, Doc continues to aid Tucker, who was in fact pregnant with an alien, and hang along with the Blues,  providing Sister with a physical and later being held captive along with her by O'Malley's new host Captain Flowers.\n\nIn ''Reconstruction'', Doc only had a cameo in the Sponsor Cut of an episode, where he was called to assist a comatose Caboose, but Washington's team had already departed before Doc arrived. Doc is next seen in ''Revelation'' when Simmons, as Washington's prisoner, calls for a medic. Command sends the nearest one, Doc, who is soon attacked by Washington and also taken prisoner, being ordered to check The Meta's vitals. In the finale of ''Revelation'', Doc helps treat Washington after the battle, and manages to escape with the Red and Blue teams.\n\nIn ''Season 10'' it is revealed that Doc eventually returned to Valhalla, where he revived Donut. After Church and Carolina leave to kill the Director, the others are left at the base when Doc talks about how close they have all become and the group is encouraged to go find Church and Carolina. Doc, who is excited they are going on another adventure, goes to pack medical equipment for the trip. He is then left behind by the Reds and Blues who leave in Hornets. However, Doc returns in ''Season 11'', along with Donut and Lopez. He assists Grif with researching the teleportation grenades found on the crashed ship. When the two present their findings to Sarge, Grif accidentally throws one at Doc and he disappears. Doc is not seen for the rest of the season, and only Lopez seems to notice his disappearance.\n\nOnly in the 13th season Doc made his return, stating that after Grif threw a \"Future Cube\" at him, he entered a sort of \"other dimension\" until emerging in the cave where Caboose, Dr. Grey, and Tucker found him. When Doc discovered that no one noticed his disappearance, an angry split personality based on O'Malley emerged and violently beat Tucker, until Dr. Grey knocked him out. Doc, manifesting this O'Malley persona, fights alongside the Reds and Blues during the final battle against Hargrove's forces.\n\nDoc returns in ''Season 15'', revealing himself as an old acquaintance of the Blues and Reds before he met the Blood Gulch troopers. Doc defects to the Blues and Reds, due to the Reds and Blues treating him poorly, but changes his mind upon realizing Temple's plan, leading Doc to be imprisoned, and then freed by Tucker. In ''The Shisno Paradox'' Doc's betrayal earns him the scorn of Grif, even if Donut's introduction of a time travel adventure has both paired. Doc tries to convince Grif of using time travel to save lives, but Grif only thinks of pizza, even traveling back to ancient [[Italy]] trying to teach the natives to make it once the dish turns out to no longer exist in the present. Doc admits he became a medic because of his failure to save his brother, but Grif passes out. When he wakes up, Grif gives Doc the time machine, saying that pizza can wait. Huggins suddenly warns Grif not to do it, and Doc reveals he is under the control of his O'Malley personality,before stranding Huggins and Grif in the past. Doc/O'Malley is later commanded to kill Donut for betraying Chrovos, resulting in a battle though time that ended in 21st century Chicago which he ended up getting blown off a building with a grenade.\n\nIn season 17 it\u2019s revealed by Donut that he died from the fall, though this is later revealed as untrue when Doc regains his memories in the Everwhen. Doc regains control of his body once more, and escapes being trapped in the Labyrinth by Genkins. Doc arrives at the Labyrinth\u2019s entrance, offering to help Chrovos and Donut. Doc, while trying to free Washington, is confronted by a manifestation of his O\u2019Malley personality. Doc merges with the O'Malley personality with him, rescuing Washington.\n\nDoc was originally envisioned as a journalist-type character but was changed to a medic when a war journalist was deemed \"too close\" to the then ongoing [[War in Iraq]].<ref name=\"InverseArticle\">{{cite web|last1=Francisco|first1=Eric|title=How 'Red vs. Blue' Built an Empire and Invented a Whole Genre|url=https://www.inverse.com/article/29928-red-vs-blue-rooster-teeth-season-15-interview|publisher=Inverse|accessdate=12 April 2017}}</ref> The original plan for Doc's character, as noted by the Rooster Teeth crew, was simply to provide a vessel for O'Malley to jump into, and also to display his pacifism. Matt Hullum notes going through several different accents for the character, such as Cockney, French and Australian, before settling on his own voice to use, as he was unsure which direction to take the character.<ref name=\"S2DVD\"/>\n\n=== Cosmic Powers ===\n==== Atlus Arcadium Rex ====\nAtlus Arcadium Rex is the leader of the Cosmic Powers.\n\n==== Genkins ====\nGenkins ([[Ricco Fajardo]]) is one of the Cosmic Powers, a group of A.I. disguised as a pantheon of gods that were created by Chrovos. Genkins is a trickster, known for cracking jokes and lying and is almost always seen with a golf club, that Atlus later gives to Caboose, something that leaves Genkins distraught. Along with the rest of the Cosmic Powers, Genkins had overthrown Chrovos and trapped him. Genkins later grows bored with pretending to be a God and desires to be one for real. To this end, he allies with Chrovos who promised him with such power if he aided him in causing the Reds and Blues to destroy the timeline. Genkins helps deteriorate Wash\u2019s mental state, erases pizza from existence, and murders Huggins to prevent her form stopping the Reds and Blues from destroying the timeline.\n\nWhen the paradox takes effect, Genkins possesses Church in the alternate timeline most of the Reds and Blues are trapped in, and tries to lead them to create more paradoxes to free Chrovos. Genkins jumps across the timeline as well, creating more paradoxes. Despite Genkins\u2019 efforts to stop Washington and Donut from rescuing the Reds and Blues from the Everwhen, they succeed; Genkins is promptly attacked and beaten up by Caboose for possessing Church.\n\nGenkins then attempts to stop the Reds and Blues from fixing the timeline, only to fail consistently. Donut convinces Genkins that Chrovos will betray and abandon him, leading to Genkins betraying Chrovos and stealing most of her power. With this new power, Genkins strips the Reds and Blues of their ability to time travel. When the Reds and Blues use the time portals to impale Genkins with his own golf club (which had been taken by Caboose), Genkins traps them in the Labyrinth. When Doc and Donut free them, Genkins is briefly trapped in the Labrynth, though he quickly escapes. Genkins snaps and goes insane, deciding to use a black hole to travel back to the beginning of time and become a god. Successfully doing so, Genkins is revealed to be Chrovos; Chrovos had forgotten her origin as Genkins. The Reds and Blues then instruct Huggins to inform the Cosmic Powers about Genkins\u2019s treachery and to trap him alongside his future self.\n\n==== Chrovos ====\nChrovos is a primordial being who existed when the universe was created with the power to control time . He is the main antagonist of Red vs Blue season 16 & 17 while also a Catalyst behind the events of season 15 .\n\n==== Kalirama the Undying ====\n==== Huggins ====\nHuggins is a sentient Light Being that appeared in season 16. She, alongside her brother Muggins, were affiliated with the Cosmic Powers and were tasked to keep an eye on the Reds and Blues. After the simulation troopers escaped from Kalirama by a time portal, she followed Grif and Doc into sixth-century Italy and failed to stop him from giving Doc the gun, not knowing he was taken over by his other personality. She later joined Grif to find Sister, who was in England with Tucker and slowly became friends.\n\nAfter the Reds and Blues met the Cosmic Powers she was ordered to watch over them and finds out that they are choosing to disobey the Cosmic Powers' request and travel back in time and stop Wash from getting shot. Outraged and feeling betrayed by Grif, Huggins rushes off to warn the Cosmic Powers about their betrayal but Genkins stops her by summoning a black hole that sucks her inside killing her. In season 17 it is revealed she survived the black hole and ended nearby a Red sun like object.\n\n==== Muggins ====\nMuggins is a sentient Light Being that is affiliated to the Cosmic Powers who first appeared in season 16. He is also the brother of Huggins.\n\n==== Labyrinth ====\nLabyrinth was an AI designed to make illusions to anyone that was brought there (specifically for people trying to free Chrovos. Except of course, \"The chosen one\") But Genkins lied to Labyrinth by telling him the Reds and Blues were trying to free Chrovos.\n\nDonut and Doc went in to try to free the Reds and Blues. In Washington's Room, O'Malley tried to get Doc to let him out. Instead, Doc decided to break his oath. In Carolina's Room, it was revealed that Carolina's fear was her old self. When Carolina defeated her fear, Labyrinth revealed himself and Donut tried to tell him Genkins was trying to break Chrovos free. When Genkins came in, Labyrinth was holding his Golf Club. Genkins them kicked him off of the edge into the Black Hole. When Genkins falls into the Black Hole, Labyrinth was actually alive.\n\n==== Burnstorm ====\n\n==Inactive and guest characters==\n===Red Team===\n====Warthog====\nThe '''M12 Light Reconnaissance Vehicle''',  codename '''Warthog''' (the vehicle's actual name in the [[Halo (video game series)|''Halo'' video game series]]) is a battle jeep frequently used by the Red Team. The first one is delivered in {{rvbep|2|Episode 2}}, where failing to see much resemblance to a [[warthog]], Grif suggests the name [[Cougar|Puma]]. Believing that Grif is suggesting the name of a mythical creature, Sarge mockingly suggests several other mythical creatures \u2014 such as [[Bigfoot]], [[unicorn]], [[leprechaun]], and \"Chupathingy\" (after the [[Chupacabra]]) \u2014 as names. ''Chupathingy'' is the name listed on the character biography, available as an [[Easter egg (virtual)|Easter egg]] for the {{rvbep|season 3}} DVD. In {{rvbep|29|Episode 29}}, Grif notes that the warthog seems to be \"really bad luck.\" During the first two seasons, it spends most of its time out of commission, or being repaired by Lopez. The warthog is frequently blaring loud [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[ranchera]] music, most likely set by Lopez, and it can often be heard approaching because of it. Throughout the show, multiple Warthogs are used, destroyed and repaired. They almost always play the same ranchera music.\n\nThe original warthog had a homing beacon and remote control system linked to Lopez. This system is accidentally activated in {{rvbep|Season 2}} when Church, then possessing Lopez, and Tucker attempt to activate Lopez's repair sequence. It was during this period that the warthog spoke, voiced by Burnie Burns. Burns suggests that, like Sheila, the vehicle was originally going to be a full-blown character and maintain a personality throughout the series, in a [[parody]] of ''[[Speed Buggy]]''. However, this idea was abandoned shortly after the remote control gag.<ref name=\"S2DVD\">Rooster Teeth Productions (2004). Audio commentary. In ''{{rvbep|season 2|Red vs. Blue Season Two}}'' [DVD]. Buda, Texas: Rooster Teeth Productions.</ref>\n\n====Lopez 2.0====\nIn ''Season 11'', Sarge decides to build a robot to fix the communications dish for the Reds and Blues. Upon completion, the robot coincidentally looks and speaks Spanish like Lopez, much to the chagrin of Grif and Simmons. The robot was named  Lopez 2.0 but more commonly referred to as Dos.0 (Shannon McCormick), which due to misunderstandings leads the Reds to think that the robot is stupid, even though Dos.0 was able to fix the radio transmitter. Dos.0 is initially very loyal and respectful until he meets Lopez, who tells the newer machine all of the bad things about the teams and how conversing with the Red Team will lead the members to make up entire conversations, regardless of the content, allowing for the Lopezes to insult them endlessly. Later, Sarge assigns Dos.0 and Lopez to repair the Cyclops robot (voiced by Katie Newville) that the Reds found on the crashed ship knowing that if they activate the robot it will kill everyone calling Sarge insane. Lopez suggests that they upload Lopez into the robot so that the two can gain respect from the others. However, Dos.0 betrays Lopez and the Reds by uploading himself into the Cyclops to attack the simulation soldiers and kill them. Dos.0 later battled Freckles while telling him that could have ruled the Reds and Blues as their Robot Overlords instead of being a pet to Caboose. Freckles was nearly destroyed by Dos.0 but got distracted and tricked by Donut allowing him to uses a transporter grenade to teleport the Cyclops over a minefield killing him. Lopez in turn takes Dos.0's body and mocks him, even calling him \"a jerk\" once the destroyed Cyclops body is found in the crash site the following season.\n\n====Francisco Montegue Zanzibar & Robot Number 2====\nFrancisco and Robot Number 2 were two Robots that we\u2019re created by Sarge to be host body\u2019s for Church and Agent Texas. Francisco was later possessed by Tex, and thereafter appeared to lose any and all self-sustainability. Robot Number 2 was later possessed by Church losing all self-sustainability. Unlike Francisco Robot Number 2 had a function to punch Grif in the head upon hearing the codeword, \"Dirtbag\".\n\n===Sarge's Elite Team===\n====Private John====\nPrivate John was a man based on John Wayne the actor who was recruited by Sarge and Simmons in the Shisno Paradox to kill Mark Temple of the Blues and Reds by travelling though time alongside George and Alex. After accidentally killing an actor playing Temple he joins Jax to help create his Red vs Blue movie based on the events of Season 15 he later got a audition to play Temple in the movie and was later playing Sarge.\n\n====Private George====\nPrivate George is a historical figure based on the first President of the United States George Washington who was recruited by Sarge and Simmons in the Shisno Paradox to kill Mark Temple of the Blues and Reds alongside John and Alex. After accidentally killing the actor playing Temple in the Red vs Blue movie being made by Jax he became his assistant director.\n\n====Private Alex====\nPrivate Alex was a historical figure based on the king of Macedonia Alexander the Great he was recruited by Sarge and Simmons in the Shisno Paradox to kill Mark temple of the Blues and Reds however Sarge didn\u2019t know that he encountered Caboose who accidentally sneezed on him giving him the Common Cold. Because of this, he constantly collapses due to the sickness and ultimately dies due to his immune system not being strong enough to battle the time period's modern diseases.\n\n===Blue Team===\n====Junior====\n'''Blarggity Blarg-Tucker'''<ref name=\"S5DVDProfiles\">[[Rooster Teeth Productions]] (2007).

[[Buda, Texas]]: Rooster Teeth Productions.</ref> (Jason Salda\u00f1a)<ref name=\"S4DVDComment\"/> commonly known as '''Junior''' is the result of the Alien supposedly impregnating Tucker, with a [[parasitic embryo]]. In {{rvbep|77|Episode 77}}, his voice is first heard. In Season 5, he causes havoc in the Blue Base and Doc feeds him with some of Caboose's blood off-screen. Junior first appears in Episode 80, and is a mini-version of the Alien, with cyan and blue armor. Its existence frustrates Church who threatens to kill it multiple times. In Episode 84, the creature is introduced to Tucker, its \"father\". Tucker slowly becomes accustomed to this role, even snapping back at Church when he refers to it in a flippant manner. In Episode 91, Tucker is heard to call him Junior, and in Episode 94, Junior mimics Tucker's catch phrase by saying \"blarg chicka honk honk\". Later on, Junior is sent through the caves with Doc and Sister, where he is found by Captain Butch Flowers, who at the time was possessed by O'Malley. According to Episode 97, Junior is part of \"The great prophecy\" and is to be the savior of the Alien. The villains, however, intend to use him to control the Aliens. It is later implied that the whole prophecy was largely fictitious.\n\nJunior was taken onto the ship that Tex used to blast off from Blood Gulch, which exploded. However, the ship was later found crashed in Valhalla with no sign of either Junior or anyone else on board. The footage found on the Pelican implies that the Other Alien escaped with Junior before the Pelican crashed. In ''Recreation'', however, Tucker mentions that Junior is with him and together they act as ambassadors between the humans and Aliens. Despite this, Junior does not make an appearance.\n\nJunior would make an appearance in a photograph carried by Tucker in Season 13 where Junior is posing with his 5th grade Basketball team and also appears in Season 13, Episode 19 in the Sangheili Embassy watching Epsilon's message. In Season 15, Tucker reveals Junior entered college with a basketball scholarship.\n\nRooster Teeth released a video detailing how Junior was filmed at such a small size, later included on the Season 5 DVD, revealing they used [[forced perspective]], placing Junior, whose model is far bigger than the human ones, farther from the camera while hiding the characters' feet.<ref>{{subscription required}} {{cite news |url=http://achievementhunter.roosterteeth.com/episode/theater-mode-2017-episode-25-zombie-croc |title=Theater Mode: Episode #25: Zombie Croc |author=Achievement Hunter |publisher=[[Rooster Teeth]] |date=January 20, 2017 |access-date=January 22, 2017 |time=1:35:07 |quote=Forced perspective [...] That's how we made Junior in RvB}}</ref>\n\n====Jimmy====\nPrivate Jimmy (Cole Gallian real self) (John Ferrell False Memory) was a Blue Team Simulation Trooper who was chosen to be the original host body of the Alpha. Not much was known of his past except that he had a girlfriend back home and that he was brought to Sidewinder by Captain Flowers who tells him that he is the 'final piece of a very complex puzzle,' and that the future would see him as the unsung hero of their story. To his horror he was restrained and violently implanted with the Alpha. Jimmy was later killed in the first season of Red vs Blue by Caboose.\n\nWhen Church was using Jimmy's body, some of his memories merged with the Alphas creating a false backstory which made Church believe that Jimmy who had a southern accent was an old squad mate and that he was killed by Tex by beating him to death with their own skull.\n\n===Project Freelancer===\n<!-- FAIR USE of Rvb Project Freelancer.jpg.jpg: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Rvb Project Freelancer.jpg.jpg for rationale -->\n[[File:Rvb Project Freelancer.jpg|thumb|300px|Project Freelancer, from left to right: The Counselor, Four Seven Niner, Maine, North, South, Carolina, York, Wash, C.T., Wyoming, Florida, the Director and Tex.]]\n\n====The Director====\n'''Director Leonard  Church'''  (John Marshall Reed) is the head of Project Freelancer, and is responsible for most of the scenarios that the Red and Blue armies encounter. He and the Chairman of the Oversight Subcommittee are heard in the introductions of the ''Reconstruction'' chapters, alternating in a series of messages. He apparently uses both armies as test subjects for his experiments. His own forces wear white armor and run the Command Center that the armies call for missions. Throughout ''Reconstruction'', he was suspected by the Chairman of wrongdoing with his experiments and underwent a criminal investigation for his misuse of military property and the Alpha AI, leading to a warrant for his arrest. In the epilogue, it was revealed that the Director is the original Leonard Church, and the AI Church was based on his own mind. He is haunted by memories of Allison, a woman he loved who died many years ago, and that he inadvertently implanted his memories of her into another AI, Beta, which became Tex.\n\nThe Director is shown in person during the flashbacks in ''Season 9'' and ''Season 10''. However, his face is almost always obscured, and he wears a pair of glasses. The Director is shown to be a very strict and unforgiving commander, who is quick to punish failure and deliberately seeds rivalry among the Freelancers. He also shows a lack of concern for the safety of his soldiers, often caring more about the experimental equipment they are using rather than their lives. This attitude and his actions have caused many of the Freelancers, such as Tex, Washington, Carolina, and C.T., to utterly despise him.\n\nIn ''Season 10'', he creates an army of Tex clones, each one an attempt to recreate Allison. When Church and Carolina confront him, he is seen viewing Alison's last video on repeat. Upon confrontation, he surrenders and requests Carolina to leave her pistol before proceeding to shut down the facility. It is also revealed that he has the same green eyes as Carolina and he states \"You were my greatest creation\" as she is leaving, implying that Carolina is his daughter.\n\n====Vic====\n'''Vic''' (introduced voiced by Randall Glass; voiced by Burnie Burns from Season 2 onwards), short for Virtual Intelligent Computer v20, is an AI responsible for overseeing the operations on Blood Gulch, whose terminal is located in a cave below the canyon. He takes the personality of a sardonic and frequently unhelpful communications officer. Unknown to either team, he serves as a contact for both the Blue and Red Teams. Vic behaves like an annoying, ineffective [[technical support]] guy, constantly calling people \"dude\" and often offering obtuse and unhelpful advice and biting insults. Burnie Burns notes that Vic was portrayed as over-the-top annoying from Episode 20 so the character would be memorable to viewers.<ref name=\"S2DVD\"/> Burns based the voice on an eponymous former roommate, who lived with him for a year after Matt Hullum left for Los Angeles following their graduation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://roosterteeth.com/episode/rt-podcast-2016-greg-miller-mr-hard-nips-2016-389 |title=Rooster Teeth Podcast #389 |accessdate=October 19, 2016 |publisher=[[Rooster Teeth]]}}</ref> During Seasons 4 and 5, where the Reds and Blues had believed to have time travelled to the future, Vic called himself '''Vic Jr.''', which Burnie Burns noted was deliberately left unexplained, as the crew felt that sufficient information had been given already for fans to draw their own conclusions. Based on information discovered later, it is implied that Vic and Vic Jr. are the same, and Vic simply pretended he was his own descendant to fool the Red and Blue teams into thinking they were in the future.<ref name=\"S5DVDComm\" />\n\nIn Season 14, Vic gives introductory narration to most episodes, and is featured in one himself, where it is revealed that Vic was originally a far more disciplined and efficient AI programmed by Agent Florida to keep watch over the Blood Gulch simulation. After Florida accidentally tripped a cable, however, Vic malfunctioned and degraded to the persona he displayed in the Blood Gulch Chronicles while also affecting the list of replacement recruits that were originally suppose to arrive in Blood Gulch replacing agents California, Hawaii and Kansas to Caboose, Donut and Kaikaina Grif.\n\nIn Season 15, Vic has started to fail from operating so long, becoming suicidal. Dylan takes Vic as a helper A.I. in exchange for killing Vic when he gives her \"three wishes\". After Loco's time machine is activated, it begins to grow unstable. Dylan has Vic try to shut it off for her third wish, though Vic deletes himself to stabilize the machine. Vic leaves behind a recording parodying Epsilon's speech at the end of ''Season 13'', culminating in him threatening to, if anyone made a backup of him, he will \"punch them in the nuts\".\n\n====Four Seven Niner====\nFour Seven Niner real name Ash ([[Lee Eddy]]) is a pilot working with Project Freelancer, . She first appears in the trailer for ''Season 9'', flying a Pelican, trying to get the injured Maine to treatment. The medical station \"''Angel On My Shoulder''\", repeatedly denies her clearance to dock and tells her to throttle down, but she is persistent and is eventually allowed to proceed at the request of the Director. \nThroughout Seasons 9 and 10, Four Seven Niner escorts the Freelancers on numerous missions and performs multiple extractions. She also appears in an episode of Season 14 and 15 apiece flying Freelancers to missions.\n\nFour Seven Niner is shown to be sarcastic and free-thinking. When Carolina remarks that she is late for extraction, she responds by saying Carolina could take it out of her tip. In their proceeding escape on the Pelican, she responds to Agent South's complaints by sealing the pilot door in her face. She also despises AI, believing that they use their superior abilities to steal jobs from humans. However, she is quick to accept Delta when he admits that he does not know how to fly a Pelican.\n\nIn the mini-series \"Recovery One\" and season 6 ''Reconstruction'', Four Seven Niner is the voice on the other end of Washington's and South's radios, relaying their orders.\n\n===Freelancer Agents===\nThe soldiers, mostly called Freelancers, are highly trained elite special ops soldiers for Project Freelancer, and are sent on the most dangerous missions. Their call-signs are based on the fifty states of America.\n\n====Tex====\nFreelancer Agent '''Texas''', also known as '''Tex''' or Beta, real name Allison, is voiced by [[Burnie Burns]] in her initial appearance and her Season 15 cameo, and Kathleen Zuelch thereafter. Of the eight main characters, Tex was the last to appear, not debuting until {{rvbep|10|Episode 10}}. Though she is associated with the Blue Team, she is not an official member, but rather a mercenary \"paid\" to help them. Her back story with Project Freelancer and previous affiliation with fellow Blue Team member Church are key elements in the plot. With her [[special forces|Special Operations]] training, she is the most lethal member of the ''Blood Gulch'' cast, and especially so while she is still implanted with the Omega AI.\n\nDespite her skill, she has a tendency to fall short in her objectives, which Epsilon reveals to be part of the process that created her: when the Director made the Alpha out of his mind, the \"Beta\" AI emerged from the memories of his deceased wife Allison, an accomplished soldier who died in battle. Because all the Director could remember of Allison was her failing to return alive, Tex is always doomed to fail just as victory is in her grasp. In Season 1 alone Tex is easily captured by Sarge after beating up three Reds and retrieving the Blue flag, and ends up killed by Donut while attacking Red Base with a tank.\n\nAt first, Tex was intent on destroying her AI, Omega\\O'Malley, knowing it had evil intentions. However, by the end of Season 5, O'Malley convinces Tex to join him as both could use Junior to end the war that led to the creation of Project Freelancer. Tex escapes in a ship at the end of ''Blood Gulch Chronicles'', with Andy, Sheila, Gamma, and Omega. After Andy detonates, this ship crashes in ''Reconstruction'' and The Meta steals her as well as Gamma and Omega. Tex is later deleted in the EMP blast set by Washington. She briefly reappeared in the trailer of ''Recreation'' along with Church, as a narrator, but does not appear in the series proper.\n\nIn ''Revelation'', Epsilon-Church comes across a new robot body made for Tex in an abandoned facility and uses his memories to recreate Tex, a version referred to as \"Epsilon-Tex\" and with much adeptness in hand-to-hand combat, as her debut has her mercilessly and repeatedly pummeling Sarge, Simmons, Grif and Tucker. Later Epsilon-Tex sets up a trap for Wash and the Meta, and the latter ends capturing her and using Beta to power his armor. After the Meta dies, Epsilon enters the capture unit to find Tex. Once she is found in a recreation of Blood Gulch, Epsilon-Church in the capture unit, Epsilon finally lets her go by saying \"I forget you\", not wishing to let her live a life of never ending failures.\n\nIn ''Season 9'' in the past storyline, she joins Project Freelancer as a Master Captain, but shortly rises through the Freelancer ranks and takes the top spot over Carolina, which created a rivalry. Carolina was especially affected by the fact that she could never seem to beat Tex, who in turn did not show much animosity for Carolina.\n\nIn ''Season 10'', Church and Carolina return to the facility looking to kill the Director, when it was revealed that the Director had kept trying to recreate Tex and instead had created dozens of angered Tex copies, which only shut down as Epsilon talks to the Tex AI powering the drones and asks her to rest. Afterwards, the Director is revealed to be Carolina's father, showing that Tex's begrudging respect for Carolina comes from how she was based on the agent's mother.\n\nIn ''Season 13'', a vision of Tex is seen as part of Carolina's worst fears. Epsilon-Tex's helmet is also seen in Hargrove's trophy room.\n\nIn ''Season 15''  it is revealed that during one test involving simulation troopers, Tex led the Reds to take the Blue flag, eventually battling Carolina who was leading the Blues, killing Biff and accidentally beginning Temple's quest for vengeance.\n\n====Wyoming====\n'''Wyoming''', true name Reginald (Matt Hullum), is a ruthless [[mercenary]] with a [[British accent]]\u2014his character profile on the DVDs states his place of birth as \"somewhere British\"<ref name=\"S4DVDProfiles\" /> \u2014 introduced in the series when O'Malley hires him to kill Tucker. Wyoming has a habit of giving an insincere \"sorry\" to his victims just prior to killing them,<ref name=\"Wyoming\">{{rvbep|43|Episode 43}}, {{rvbep|52}}, {{rvbep|71}}.</ref> but, in one instance, retracts this apology when Tex complains to him that he destroyed her alien ship.<ref name=\"Ep71\">{{rvbep|71|Episode 71}}.</ref> He also is never shown getting agitated, showing no signs of annoyance when he cannot spot his target during an assassination. Wyoming is fond of knock-knock jokes, a trait he passed on to his AI Gamma.\n\nWyoming has an armor enhancement, the time distortion unit, which he uses to continually [[time loop|loop a particular stretch of time]] in order to modify events in his favor. His use of the time looping is discovered by Tucker, who eventually lulls Wyoming into complacency and stabs him with a sword early in the loop, killing him. However, he and Church quickly discovered that, several copies of Wyoming were created as a result of the loop. In the resulting chaos the Reds attacked the Wyomings, leaving only one alive. The final Wyoming is then dispatched by Tex. Tex then uses Wyoming's helmet to obtain coordinates for the ship in which she later escapes, but ends up being blown. In ''Reconstruction'', it is implied that once the bomb exploded, the time distortion was activated, with the ensuing [[time dilation]] leading the ship to take nearly a year to crash land in Outpost-17B (Valhalla). Wyoming's armor enhancement was then taken by The Meta.\n\nIn the ''Season 9'' flashbacks he is shown fighting Tex along with Maine and York in a training session where the three are beaten repeatedly by Tex. In the last round of eight, all of which Tex won, he and Maine use live ammo, Wyoming even manages to hit her during the fight, but they are still beaten. He is depicted without his helmet in Chapter 6 of ''Season 10'', revealing he has black hair and a handlebar mustache. Wyoming is depicted as a sniper and has a careful style of attack. He is implied to be the first one attacked by a crazed Maine, however he manages to evade death and the removal of his AI.\n\nThe auditions for Wyoming are described by the cast as \"terrible\", almost every cast member auditioned for the role doing various accents-for example, Joel Heyman performed a [[Cockney]] accent, Burnie Burns an Australian accent-and eventually Matt Hullum's British accent, considered the only acceptable one.<ref name=\"S3DVDComment\">Rooster Teeth Productions (2005). Audio commentary. In ''Red vs. Blue: Season Three'' [DVD]. Buda, Texas: Rooster Teeth Productions.</ref>\n\n====York====\nAgent New York, referred to as '''York''' (Sean Duggan), is another member of the AI experimental program. York is an infiltration specialist who seems to have become unemployed since the program closed down. His left eye was severely injured in a grenade explosion during a 3 on 1 brawl against Tex, with Wyoming and Maine. Despite his armor's healing unit, his eye did not heal, nor did it later save his life.\n\nHe is found by Tex during Part 3 of the miniseries ''Out of Mind'', trying to break into a store. It is revealed that he still had Delta. Here he accepts Tex's proposal of infiltrating Omega's base. At the end of ''Out of Mind'', he and Tex attempt a raid on Omega's base. The two are caught in a firefight against Wyoming and two of his minions. As the two scramble for cover, York is shot twice in the chest by Wyoming, and Delta reports that the bullets were fatal. The AI stays with York and manages to trick Wyoming with a hologram of Tex. Delta chooses to stay with York until his death, rather than go with Tex, appearing to perish with him as the armor shuts down. The healing unit in his armor would later be retrieved, along with Delta, by Washington.\n\nHe appears in the trailer for ''Season 9'', where he removes his helmet, revealing the broken eye, and brown/red hair. This marks him as the third character aside from Vic/Vic Jr, North, South. to have his face fully revealed. In ''Season 9'', the origin of his eye wound is revealed. During the paintball fight with Tex, a live grenade meant for Tex is detonated next to him. He is also shown to have some kind of relationship with Carolina, who inquires about his eye when he returns from the hospital. York is shown to have a sarcastic personality. For example, while attempting to organize his team against Tex in the training mission, he makes several sarcastic remarks when his suggestions are ignored. He is also the first Freelancer to officially receive an AI.\n\nIt was revealed that he met Carolina at a club, where she takes his lighter from him. During the raid on the ''Mother Of Invention'' where Texas attempted to retrieve the Alpha AI York sided with her, telling Carolina that he was 'doing the right thing', after having been told by his AI Delta of Alpha's torture. When facing Carolina York seemed hesitant to fight her and was quickly defeated by her while battling hand-to-hand in a zero gravity environment. Before leaving Carolina threw her cigarette lighter to York, something which brought York great sadness since he understood that she didn't expect to see him again. Whether this was because Carolina now considered York to be a traitor or because she didn't expect to survive her battle with Texas has been left unclear.\n\n====South====\n'''Agent South Dakota''', referred to as '''South''' (Shana Merlin), is another member of Project Freelancer. South signed up with her twin brother, who was appropriately given the codename North Dakota. Unlike some of the other operatives, however, South was not given an AI partner; according to South, there was more than one group of soldiers for implantation, and after complications with the first group, specifically Washington himself, no more AIs were given to operatives in the next group, including South.<ref>Burns notes in the commentary for Part Four of ''Recovery One'' that South feels resentment for not being given an AI, despite the problems some had presented, as she had been enthusiastic about receiving one.</ref> Later, Delta states she was part of an experiment alongside her brother, North, to analyze how some agents without AIs would respond to working with agents who did have them. She still, however, received an armor enhancement, able to create a domed energy shield.\n\nSouth's first appearance is in Part 2 of the mini-series ''Recovery One'', where she is found by Washington alongside her deceased brother. South claims that she found North already dead when she arrived, and North's AI, Theta, was already missing. Washington is ordered by command to kill South, but instead keeps her with him, as he believes the Freelancers are being hunted and he could use help. As he dislikes having an AI implanted into himself, he resolves to giving South the Delta AI he had already recovered. When they encounter The Meta, she shoots him in the back so she can make an easier getaway from their enemy. She then radios command, and it is revealed she also operates under the codename '''Recovery Two''', and that she was using Washington to draw out the enemy so that command could devise a strategy against it with the promise of an AI as a reward. She then refuses to return to base, flying away with Delta. Command threatens to locate her with other agents, but South claims she is more worried about something else.\n\nIn the opening episode of ''Reconstruction'', South's whereabouts are listed on a communications screen as still unknown. A very much-alive Washington states his desire to hunt her down, and his superior states that they are not far from letting him, also feeling the sting of her betrayal, although Washington harbors some resentment towards Command as well, given that South was under their orders when she attacked him. In Chapter 4 South is shown to be following Washington, but unbeknownst to her, The Meta is as well. In the next Chapter, Washington receives a call from his commanders alerting him to the fact that South is in critical danger, as shown by a distress beacon sent by Delta. When Washington and the others arrive, they find South under heavy fire from The Meta, using her energy shield enhancement to protect herself. She then attempts to abandon Delta and her enhancement so she can escape. Caboose guns her down to stop her from escaping. After The Meta leaves, Washington interrogates her, according to Delta, South also betrayed her brother North much like how she had betrayed Washington. Delta says that her injuries will only hinder them and there is a high probability she would betray them again, so Washington kills her in mid-sentence, securing vengeance for himself and North in the process.\n\nSeason 9 has featured South as an active operative under Project Freelancer, carrying out a mission with her brother North, during which they frequently employ a tag-team style of combat. She is much more impulsive in her actions, though, ignoring half of his advice, charging into most situations without thinking too far ahead, and much more eager to get her hands dirty. However, this same impulsive attitude often causes her to make bad decisions, forcing the Director to ban her from future missions. In ''Season 10'', South is allowed to participate in missions again, though she is clearly bitter over the fact that she will not receive an AI like North did. During the revolt on the 'Mother of Invention', she blocked Tex's way and nearly killed her out of spite, but is stopped by her brother, who fights her. Once she removes her helmet while complaining to the Director, South is revealed to be a blonde headed woman with a large scar on her left cheek.\n\n====North====\n'''Agent North Dakota''', referred to as '''North''' (John Erler), is South's twin brother, even dressing in similar armor.<ref name=\"NorthSouth\">In the ''Recovery One'' Part Two commentary, Burns and Hullum note that they gave North a purple suit with green trim to keep it apparent that the two were twins and hence dressed similarly, and surveyed people about which color, purple or violet, suited which character more.</ref>  His only appearance before the Season 9 flashbacks is of his dead body, which Washington found after receiving a distress signal sent out by North's armor. Like York, North still had his AI partner, Theta, in his possession at the time of his death, but Washington and South surmise that it was stolen by his attacker. While surveying his dead body, South gives a lengthy spiel about growing up with North and how the two of them were both so alike in almost every way. It is revealed in ''Reconstruction'' that South actually betrayed him in order to lure The Meta into stealing North's armor components, giving South the time she needed to flee. Delta claims she lured him into a position where he could be killed as opposed to killing him directly.\n\n''Season 9'' has featured North as an active operative under Project Freelancer, carrying out a mission with his sister South, during which they frequently employ a tag-team style of combat, perfectly in sync with each other. He's much more methodical in his actions than his sister, attempting to rein her in by being her voice of reason, but he also appears to have no problem adapting to sudden changes in the plan. In Season 10, it is revealed that he was given Theta due to North's caring attitude and Theta's shyness.\n\nNorth has provided an example of what happens when the enhanced armor abilities are utilized without the assistance of an AI unit, by applying a domed energy shield on top of a Pelican mid-flight to block oncoming missiles, which prevents the crash but leads him to collapse once his armor overheated. During the process, he removes his helmet, revealing himself as a blonde man, who in the incident gets a scar in his cheek that mirrors the one South already had. Later he ended up fighting his sister aboard the 'Mother of Invention'.\n\n====C.T.====\n'''Agent Connecticut''', also known as Connie or '''C.T.''' (Samantha Ireland) was a member of Project Freelancer, a Caucasian woman with brown hair and brown eyes shown to be much more unnerved and anxious about the rankings and missions, along with a wariness as to why they are pushed so far, and especially how the agents are pitted against each other. C.T. eventually defects to the Insurrectionists, romancing [[#Insurrectionist Leader|their leader]] and giving classified Freelancer information to him. As the Insurrectionists attack the Freelancer flagship, C.T. escapes with them to a hideout in a shipyard. Once the Freelancers attack, C.T. insists she and the Leader should escape, but he refuses to eave without his teammates. Tex and Carolina break into the bunker and C.T. tries to explain to them why she left Project Freelancer but the two do not believe her and a battle ensures. Tex ends up mortally wounding C.T. but the Leader manages to drag her into an escape pod, and they escape. As C.T. dies in his arms, she hands the Leader a device containing a location to where an artifact is. After she dies, the Leader then takes her armor and the C.T. codename.\n\nWhen Tex inspects a [[dog tag]] on C.T.'s locker, she finds a data chip that once uploaded, reveals a recording of C.T. informing her that after digging through Project Freelancer's files, she knows of what the Director has done to the Alpha and that Tex herself is the shadow of Allison; the Director's long-lost love. C.T. states she left this copy of the data she took specifically for Tex; not because she is the best fighter, but because she is the most trustworthy.\n\n====Maine/The Meta====\n[[Image:Meta RVB.jpg|thumb|The Meta, shown with seven AI: (clockwise from top left) Delta (green), Sigma (orange), Gamma (blue), Omega (grey), Eta and Iota (yellow, it is revealed that they can join together), Theta (blue and red) and Beta/Tex (light grey).]]\n'''Agent Maine''' is first introduced as '''The Meta''' (Matt Hullum), the primary antagonist of the Recollection trilogy. The Meta has an inability to speak, only communicating through in growls, due to an injury he sustained in earlier missions.\n\nHe first appears in ''Reconstruction'' as a mysterious character, who is hunting down Freelancers, killing them, and taking their equipment and AIs. He referred to as \"The Meta\" by Agent Washington and the Counselor, in reference to a cryptic message scratched into a wall of Outpost 17-B's Red base. He proves to be a capable foe for The Reds, Blues and Washington. Prior to the events of ''Reconstruction'' he managed to obtain seven AIs, and eventually obtains an eighth before losing them all when Washington sets off an EMP at Freelancer command.\n\nIn ''Revelation'', The Meta is shown to be working with Washington. He is also shown to have difficulties using his armor enhancements due to the loss of his AIs. The Meta later captures the revived Tex and betrays Washington, using the captured AI to power his cloaking field. Later, when the Reds and Blues attack, The Meta manages to fight them off, but Sarge tricks him and attaches a Warthog's tow-hook to his chest. Grif and Simmons push the Warthog over a nearby cliff. Sarge manages to dislodge the capture unit from The Meta's back just before he is pulled over the edge, where he falls to his death. This is confirmed by Chairman Hardgrove in Season 13 as he uses Maine's armor to give Locus and Felix incentive to work harder. Afterwards, Grif keeps his Brute Shot as a trophy.\n\nIn the Season 9 and 10 flashbacks, Maine is shown to be less skilled in combat than other Freelancers such as Tex and Carolina, relying primarily on brute strength than precise skill. However, he more than makes up for this through his incredible endurance. He is consistently shown to continue fighting despite suffering injuries that would cripple, if not outright kill, anyone else. During one mission in Season 9, Maine took a sniper bullet to the chest, got hit by a Warthog and had an entire magazine of bullets emptied into his neck, the injury that made him lose his deep and rough voice, and instead only growl. To help him communicate again, Carolina gave Maine her AI, Sigma. This leads her to later blame herself for the creation of the Meta, as Sigma corrupted Maine into going after other fragments. Season 10 reveals Maine's head, but not his face, showing that he is bald and has the Meta symbol tattooed in the back of his head.\n\n====Utah====\n'''Agent Utah''' (Kerry Shawcross) is briefly mentioned by Washington in the aftermath of North's hasty decision to use enhanced armor abilities in the field, which are presumably still in early experimental stages. Utah is provided as an example of how dangerous it is to use said equipment without the assistance of an AI unit, as during training it's implied such an action did not end well for Utah, possibly leading to death or severe injury.\n\nIn a deleted scene, Utah is shown to have been testing his bubble shield in training. Despite activating the armor enhancement in Project Freelancer facilities under a supervised environment, the shield only materialized around his head, quickly forcing him to pass out. This implies his death.\n\nIn an Easter egg after the credits on the season 10 DVD. It shows that Utah survived his test with the shield. Utah finds Georgia's lucky penny.\n\n====Georgia====\n'''Agent Georgia''' (Kerry Shawcross) was briefly mentioned by Agent Carolina before the team jumped out of the Pelican during the attack on the U.N.S.C. Scrap Metal Recycling Station. Carolina said that the team should use their jet packs sparingly or end up like Georgia. When Wash asked what happened to Georgia, South tells him that no one knows. In when the Freelancers use their jet packs to reach the station, York is surprised at this course of action given what happened to Georgia. When Wash again asks what happened to Georgia, York simply says, \"Dude, you do not wanna know.\" In Chapter 4, Washington tries to escape a nuclear bomb, but refuses to use his jet pack as he does not want to end up like Georgia. After the credits on the Season 10 DVD it shows what happens to Georgia. He slams in to a space station wall after forgetting his lucky penny.\n\n====Florida====\n'''Captain Butch Flowers''' ([[Ed Robertson]]) was the Blue Team's previous [[commanding officer]] at Blood Gulch. His character is introduced when Church arrives at Blood Gulch after \"travelling back in time\". Flowers had been planning to lead a Blue offensive to destroy the Red Team in Blood Gulch, claiming he knew the key to the Blues' victory. However, before he can lead the attack he dies in his sleep. Church attempts to save Flowers, but he suffers a fatal [[allergy|allergic]] reaction to the [[aspirin]] medication, and dies anyway. After Flowers' death, Tucker, who had been wearing regulation blue armor, claims his captain's armor for himself. In {{rvbep|Season 5}}, it is revealed that one of the Blues is to be promoted to captain, and Grif's sister is sent to fill the discrepancy.\n\nCaptain Flowers returns in Episode 96, wearing Tucker's old blue armor, accompanied by a new alien. He is revealed to be O'Malley's current host, and expresses a strong interest in Junior. Andy reveals in Episode 97 that the Alien revived Flowers. In Episode 99, he talks to Vic Jr. where they discuss their plans concerning Junior. Once O'Malley leaves his body he rejoins the Blue team in the final episode, but is shot in the head by a sniper rifle before he has a chance to reveal the information key to the Blues' victory. In season 16 it\u2019s revealed that Butch was killed by a future version of Tucker who accidentally killed him believing that the sniper rifle safety was off.\n\nFlowers appears unnamed throughout the flashbacks in ''Season 9'' and ''Season 10'', assisting the Freelancers. When they infiltrate the base to pursue the Leader and C.T., the Leader realizes he is being followed and throws a tomahawk, scoring a direct hit on Flowers and knocking him to the ground. However, he quickly recovers, pulls the tomahawk from his shoulder and throws it at the Insurrectionist Turret Soldiers pinning down the Freelancers. However, the tomahawk falls short of its target. He then shoots a nearby crane arm, which knocks the Insurrectionists into a pit, where they are crushed by a falling crate.\n\nIn the finale of ''Season 10'' it is revealed that he was a former agent of Project Freelancer, '''Agent Florida'''. He was tasked with protecting the Alpha in Blood Gulch, the Counselor then stated to the Director he would then cover up Florida's disappearance. It is implied that this is accomplished by destroying the state of [[Florida]].\n\n====Illinois====\n'''Agent Illinois''' was a demolitions expert and drinking buddy of York. Unlike many other Freelancer agents, Illinois was neither ambitious or competitive; instead he focused on his dream to own a home on a tropical island (with a tiny red sailboat), which he achieved after the fall of Project Freelancer. Temple later finds him, and kills Illinois with the armor lock mode. His armor, along with that of nine other agents, is seen in his secret room.\n\n====The Triplets====\nSeason 14 has two episodes focusing on the worst agents of Project Freelancer, who for their close friendship are nicknamed \"The Triplets\". They are '''Ohio''' (Elizabeth Maxwell), real name Vera, frustrated with the incompetence of her friends and not being assigned missions by Command; '''Idaho''' (Barrett Tribe), real name Ezra, a level-headed but incompetent soldier; and '''Iowa''' (Shannon McCormick), real name Mike, who after an accident that left him for minutes without oxygen became dim-witted and erratic, along with a destructive driver. For their bad performances but proficiency in working together, Command eventually gives them a mission in an ice planet, that turns out to be just an excuse to exhile the Triplets. In the planet, they find a base with equally stranded troops from Charon Industries, Sherry (Kat Ramzinski), Darryl (Aaron Alexander) and Terrill ([[Bill Wise]]) - a riff off of ''[[Newhart]]'' - and Ohio eventually decides to start a grudge which would basically become a [[stalemate]] reminiscent of how ''Red vs. Blue'' started (\"the only reason we need to be here is because they have a base over there, and the only reason they need a base is because we're here\").\n\nShannon McCormick, who also wrote the episodes, revealed that along with voicing the character named after his home state, he named  his companions for the states Iowa is normally confused with.<ref>[http://rootbeerflotsam.tumblr.com/post/172280156803/so-with-the-triplets-you-went-for-similar-names Shannon's Tumblr]</ref>\n\n===Freelancer Artificial Intelligences===\nCreated by Project Freelancer, the [[artificial intelligence|AI's]] are programs that are partnered with the Freelancers for improved performance (similar to [[Cortana (Halo)|Cortana]] in the original ''Halo''). The original AI, Alpha (Church), was tortured in order to split its personality, creating new AIs. Each of these fragments possessed a different aspect of the Alpha's personality. However, some of these AIs malfunctioned, resulting in events like Epsilon's attempted [[suicide]] and Omega's rampage. This brought the end of the implantation process. In ''Reconstruction'', The Meta seeks to possess the AIs and armor upgrades of all other Freelancers, and he eventually collected seven. These AIs were destroyed by an EMP at the end of ''Reconstruction''. The fragmented Alpha AIs currently survive as memories inside the Epsilon unit, as revealed in ''Revelation''.\n\n====Omega====\nA common enemy of both the Red and Blue Teams, '''O'Malley''' (voiced by Burnie Burns, Matt Hullum, or whoever the AI is possessing) is an AI program and the primary antagonist of ''The Blood Gulch Chronicles''. O'Malley's real name is '''Omega'''. The name ''O'Malley'' originates from a [[portmanteau]] of ''Omega'' and Tex's real name, ''Allison'' (Om'Alli). Tex claims Omega was a program designed to enhance her combat skills, but it also brought a violent attitude. According to Agent Washington, he inherited the ability to jump via radio to other hosts from the Alpha. Washington notes that while they tried to reassign him, he had a preference for Tex, and would always find his way back to her.\n\nO'Malley is sadistically evil and aggressive, and was originally intended as a [[parody]] of over-the-top, [[narcissistic personality disorder|megalomaniac]]al [[supervillain]]s. O'Malley, being the Alphas fragment of rage, wants to annihilate both teams, and take over the universe. He expresses these desires in long monologues accompanied by extended fits of evil laughter.\n\nToward the end of Season 1, just before Tex attacks the Reds, O'Malley assesses that Tex has little chance of survival and jumps via [[radio]] into Caboose. Under O'Malley's possession, Caboose periodically makes threatening statements, but O'Malley is never able to take full control, possibly due to Caboose not having much of a mind in the first place. After being forced out of Caboose by Church and Tex, O'Malley possesses Doc, of whom he is able to take control of and use to further his own agenda, however, Doc often resurfaces, causing O'Malley to constantly argue with himself. He seems to work for Vic to some degree, hiring Wyoming to assassinate Tucker. In Episode 73 it is revealed that O'Malley, Doc and Lopez had been hiding in a secret lair. In the {{rvbep|74|following episode}}, O'Malley, Doc, and Lopez return to Blood Gulch, at the request of Church, to [[diagnosis|diagnose]] Tucker's illness. Near the end of Season 4, he sees a chance to leave and jumps out of Doc.\n\nThroughout most of {{rvbep|season 5}} his location is unknown; the Blues assume he is in Sheila because of her erratic and violent behavior. The suspicion then falls on Church when Sheila reveals O'Malley's current location to be \"the Blue leader.\" This is quickly dispelled by Church in Episode 96 as he was never officially promoted, and it is then revealed that O'Malley is currently inhabiting Captain Butch Flowers. In Episode 100, Tex begins broadcasting on an open channel to lure O'Malley. O'Malley then jumps to nearly everyone in the canyon, and is then voiced by each character's respective voice actor. When he finally jumps into Tex, they board the ship and take off. Then Andy the bomb, who was placed on the ship by the Reds, detonates, apparently killing everyone on board.\n\nIn ''Reconstruction'' it is revealed that the ship crashed and Omega was stolen by a mysterious new enemy, The Meta. He was originally meant to have a larger role in Chapter 19, where a battle scene between The Meta and the Recovery Agents is shown. One projected idea was Omega possessing a Recovery Agent and using the body to kill other agents.<ref>Red vs. Blue: Reconstruction DVD commentary</ref> Omega is eventually wiped out with the seven other AI collected by The Meta during the EMP blast set off by Washington in ''Reconstruction''. However, he, along with the other AI fragments, survives as a memory in Epsilon.\n\nOmega appears in Chapter 15 of ''Season 10''. He is shown to be a much more menacing character than in ''The Blood Gulch Chronicles''. He speaks in a low guttural growl in an angry tone. During Tex's sparring match with Carolina, Tex orders Omega to log off and stay out of the fight, to which he snarls \"Next time.\" Omega then reveals the true extent of his malice when Carolina breaks down due to the strain having two AIs in her mind. He goads Tex to kill Carolina, but Tex resists.\n\nDespite Omega deletion in season 6 he was able to leave remnants of his personality in former hosts. Caboose who was infected by Omega in season 1 was able to enter a state of rage when angered while Doc after entering a alternate dimension in season 11 gained a split personality called O\u2019Malley who became the dominant personality in season 16.\n\nOmega is one of the few characters to be voiced by more than one actor; several of the production crew, including Burnie Burns, have claimed they prefer the O'Malley presented by Matt Hullum. The O'Malley presented by Hullum has been regarded as a combination of [[Stewie Griffin]], [[Dr. Evil]], [[Gollum]] and many other villains.<ref name=\"S2DVD\" />\n\n====Gamma====\n'''Gamma''', also known as '''Gary'''<ref name=\"cat\">According to the Season 4 Commentary, this character was named after Gus Sorola's cat, which died just before the completion of Season 4.</ref> by combining its name with that of its original owner, Reginald\\Wyoming, is an AI housed in a computer, similar to Durandal in ''[[Marathon (computer game)|Marathon]]''. He talks through [[Mac OS X]] [[speech synthesis|voice synthesizer]], System Voice \"Fred\", and represents the Alpha's Deceit.\n\nChurch first encounters Gary after he \"travels back in time\". He talks of the existence of \"The Great Weapon\", which is part of \"The Great Prophecy\". This prophecy later proves to be fictitious. He is fond of jokes, and sometimes uses [[knock-knock joke]]s to communicate instead of giving a straight answer. He claims to have been built by Aliens, but knows nothing about his creators, only about the ''Shisno'', a [[pejorative]] of [[human being|humans]] described as the equivalent of the feces of the feces of the foulest-smelling animal on the planet.\n\nAfter learning the name of Wyoming's AI (Gamma), Church concludes that Gary is actually Gamma and not an alien computer. Church phones Gary, and after an awkward conversation of Gary saying he is not Gamma, Gary hangs up, and has a short conversation with Wyoming himself, who instructs Gary to \"hop in.\" It is later apparent that Gary used Wyoming's special ability to loop back in time to contact Church. At the end of Episode 97 Gary occupies the tank which previously housed Sheila's AI. He begins to shoot at the Blues under the command of Wyoming, but Tucker quickly plugs a cable from the ship housing Sheila into the tank. Sheila downloads Gary into the ship and locks him behind a firewall.\n\nIn ''Reconstruction'', the ship that crash landed in Outpost 17-B is confirmed to be the same that housed Gary in the finale of the ''Blood Gulch Chronicles''. Afterwards, The Meta took both Gamma and the armor enhancement from Wyoming's helmet. Gamma is eventually wiped out with the seven other AI collected by The Meta during the EMP blast set off by Washington in ''Reconstruction.''\n\nIn Chapter 16 of ''Revelation'' the computer that Gary is normally represented by is seen while Tex and Epsilon-Church are talking. He makes an appearance in ''Season 10'', where he misleads Carolina on the strength of Tex's AI, Omega. Sigma, seeing an opportunity to get two AI in one target, builds on the lie.\n\n====Delta====\nThe AI fragment representing Alpha's logic, '''Delta''' (or \"D\" for short, voiced by Mark Bellman) is originally assigned to York. Unlike the other agents, York somehow retained his AI after the program closed. Unlike some of the other AIs, Delta does not pose a threat to anyone. Instead, he is extremely logical and analytical, to the point of being largely unfamiliar with human emotions. Matt Hullum has described Delta as \"largely devoid of personality.\"<ref name=\"RecOneP1\">''Red vs Blue: Recovery One'' Part One commentary</ref>  Delta is also polite and well-mannered, even bidding good luck to his enemy Wyoming when he believed himself to be shutting down. York often asks for Delta's advice on certain situations, such as whether or not to help Tex, and uses Delta to watch his left side during combat due to his visual impairment. Burnie Burns also notes that Delta was useful in ''Recovery One'' as a way of reminding the audience indirectly of the various rules of the freelancer program and the AIs.<ref name=\"RecOneP3\">''Red vs Blue: Recovery One'' Part Three commentary</ref>\n\nDelta often appears as a holographic miniature soldier beside York's head; the green glow was created in-game by using the plasma pistol according to Burnie Burns.<ref name=\"S5DVDComm\" />  However, Delta can modify his appearance to match the situation. When threatened by Tex, he went \"on alert\" and his glow turned red. Later, in a ploy to trick Wyoming, Delta managed to change his size and color, and appears as a hologram of Tex.\n\nAfter York was fatally wounded at O'Malley's base, Delta decide to stay with him, having picked up a fond attachment to his host. When an operative dies their armor shuts down the AIs within them, and so it was believed Delta perished with York. However, some time later, Agent Washington comes to collect Delta, who is alive and confused as to why he was not shut down. Washington explains that AIs are too expensive to simply destroy, so they are instead [[encrypted]] for a Recovery Agent to pick them up, after which they are stored. Washington then removes Delta from York's suit and takes him away. Delta is later implanted in South, as Washington dislikes having an AI due to a past incident. Agent Washington intends for her to assist him in confronting an unknown enemy that has been hunting the remaining freelancers. Following this, South betrays Washington, shooting him and taking Delta. It is then revealed this was part of commands plan. However, she betrays command as well and escapes with Delta, all she wanted was an AI.\n\nIn ''Reconstruction'', South is still shown to be in possession of Delta, who warns her about the risks of following Washington. They are attacked by The Meta, and South attempts to abandon Delta as bait, but she is stopped by Caboose. He is then given to Caboose as a new host just before Washington, on Delta's advice, kills South. Not long after, The Meta finds an unconscious Caboose, who split off from the group on Delta's insistence. Several other AIs appear around Delta as The Meta collects him, welcoming him while he remains silent. In Caboose's mind, Church discovers critical information that Delta left in order to help Washington: the message, \"Memory is the key.\" Caboose's mental projection of Delta also warns Church that the next time they meet, the AI may not want his help. In Chapter 16, it is revealed that Delta is the logic fragment of Alpha which the Alpha shed so as to not be able to analyze the suffering it endured. In Chapter 19 Delta is destroyed by the EMP set by Washington.\n\nDelta reappears briefly in ''Revelation'', when Epsilon-Church is temporarily disabled. He reveals that he and the other collected AI fragments have been able to secretly maintain their existence within Epsilon's memories. However, he fears Epsilon will eventually discover their existence. Delta then warns Caboose that Epsilon is trying to regain his memories, some of which could drive him to insanity again.\n\nDuring Season 12, episode 11 Epsilon-Delta is seen during Epsilon-Church's hyper-fast analysis of Carolina's fight with the Space Pirates; Delta questions Church's decisions. Church respond that \"sometimes, you just gotta have faith\".\n\nIn Season 13, episode 11 Carolina orders Church to run all of her armor enhancements at once. When Church begins yet another analysis, Delta freezes and dematerializes. During episode 20, Delta asks if Church is sure about defragmenting himself to power the Meta's armor, which Church confirms, before having Delta record his final goodbye to the Reds and Blues.\n\n====Theta====\n'''Theta''' (J.D. Burns)  was Agent North Dakota's artificial intelligence unit during the AI experimental program, the fragment that represents Alpha's Trust. Towards the program's end, Theta was assigned to North while North's twin-sister South was given no AI, to see how the three would react. Later on, when The Meta began to hunt down and kill the Freelancers, taking their equipment and AIs, Theta, North, and South were attacked by the rogue Freelancer. In order to survive, South allowed North to be killed (off-camera) and let The Meta take Theta so that she could escape.\n\nTheta remained with The Meta while he hunted down and took several more AI units. In ''Reconstruction'' Chapter 8, Theta is among the AIs that welcome Delta into The Meta's stolen AI collection. Theta is eventually wiped out with the seven other AI collected by The Meta during the EMP blast set off by Washington in ''Reconstruction.''\n\nTheta appears in ''Season 10''. In addition to now having more childlike proportions, he displays very childlike traits such as hiding behind North's leg when first introduced to other Freelancers and playing on a holographic skateboard during a lecture. He demonstrated exceptional skills in managing North's Shield enhancement.\n\nEpsilon-Theta later appears in Season 12, during Epsilon's hyper-fast analysis of Carolina's fight with Space Pirates.\n\n====Sigma====\n'''Sigma''' ([[Elijah Wood]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5905511/elijah-wood-stars-in-next-season-of-red-vs-blue-yes-really |website=[[Kotaku]] |date=April 26, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120429040130/http://kotaku.com/5905511/elijah-wood-stars-in-next-season-of-red-vs-blue-yes-really |archive-date=April 29, 2012 |first=Kate |last=Cox |title=Elijah Wood Stars in Next Season of Red vs Blue.

In ''Season 10'', he displays great interest in the idea of AI [[Marathon Trilogy#Rampancy|rampancy]], specifically the theoretical fourth stage, Metastability, in which an AI can be considered fully human. Sigma believed that if it brought together all of the AI fragments that he would become the Alpha. He even manages to trick Carolina into getting two AIs. It was Sigma that convinced Agent Maine to kill his fellow Freelancers and steal their AI and equipment, becoming The Meta. He never achieves his goal, however as Sigma, along with all the AIs captured by The Meta, was destroyed in an EMP.\n\n====Eta and Iota====\n'''Eta''' and '''Iota''', the Alpha's fear and happiness, were two artificial intelligences implanted in Agent Carolina. Originally intended for Washington or South, Carolina instead requested to receive two, so she could increase her abilities and become a better agent than Tex. Following the Freelancer Break-in led by Tex, the Mother of Invention crashes on Sidewinder, The Meta removes both from Carolina. They are eventually wiped out with the six other AI collected by The Meta during the EMP blast set off by Washington in ''Reconstruction.''\n\n===The Insurrection===\n'''Charon Private Security Forces''' also referred to as  '''The Insurrection''' or the '''Resistance''' by Project Freelancer is a military force that has defected from the UNSC, shown in the prequel sections of ''Season 9'' and ''Season 10'' and is the main antagonist of Project Freelancer However, they are actually UNSC soldiers hired by Charon Industries to act as their private security force. They are first seen in Chapter 2 of ''Season 9''. They take the attitude of nonchalance towards their duties, and are commonly used for comic relief during a stressful scene. They also show little aptitude in combat, and are repeatedly pummeled by the Freelancers. Some Insurrectionist, however, are more competent in combat, these soldiers serve as powerful foes to the Freelancers.\n\n====Insurrectionist Demo Man====\n'''The Insurrectionist Demo Man''' (Brandon Farmahini) first appears in ''Season 9'', Chapter 2, appearing to be in charge of the Bj\u00f8rdinal Cryogenics Research Facility. When North and South Dakota infiltrate the base to steal a data file, the Demo Man, along with dozens of other Insurrectionist soldiers, surround the two Freelancers on a heli-pad. He mans a turret and demands the two return the file, however Carolina appears and knocks him down and the three Freelancers proceed to fight the Insurrectionists. The Demo Man manages to get back on the turret and heavily injure North before Carolina sends him, along with other soldiers, into the water below. Later, when the Freelancers are infiltrating a building, he sends a squad up to kill the Freelancers. In the following chapter, he, along with dozens of Insurrectionists, surround the Freelancers on top of the building. He demands York disarm Tex's bomb, but York reveals it isn't a bomb, only a transmitter. York then hands the Demo Man the transmitter, who looks up just as a MAC round crushes the building.\n\nHe reappears in ''Season 10'', Chapter 7, revealing he survived the events of the previous season. In a battle at the Insurrection base, he drives a Warthog, while the Female Soldier uses the turret. Twice during the battle he saves the Female Soldier from being killed by Carolina. When lifts his arm to fire his shotgun, it is revealed that he has a robotic arm after the events of the previous season. He manages to do impressive feats with his new arm, such as catching a grenade from Maine's Brute Shot. Eventually, Maine throws the blade of the Brute Shot to slice his arm off, then knocks him into the water. In a deleted scene from ''Season 10'', after the battle at Longshore, he washes up on a beach. Having now lost both arms, he swears he will have his revenge on Project Freelancer.\n\n====Insurrectionist Sniper====\n'''The Insurrectionist Sniper''' (Nathan Zellner) first appears in ''Season 9'', Chapter 13. He wears binoculars on his helmet and has a cross-hair emblem on his armor. Later, in Chapter 17, he is part of the response team sent out to stop the Freelancers from stealing a briefcase. He, the Insurrectionist Female Soldier and the Sleeveless Soldier follow the Freelancers Warthog using jet packs and engage them on the highway.\n\nHe later appears in ''Season 10'', Chapter 7, using a seagull as target practice. In the following chapter the Freelancers attack the Insurrectionist base. As they begin their attack, the Insurrectionist Sniper appears, alongside other snipers and pins down the Freelancers. Carolina asks North for help and he throws his Domed Energy Shield in the direction of the snipers. The enhancement lands beside the group and activates. The Sniper then tells the soldiers to hold their fire. However, one of the soldiers fires at the shield and the bullet bounces off and kills him. The dead soldier falls, firing the rest of his ammo inside the shield causing the bullets to ricochet, killing the remaining soldiers including the Sniper.\n\n====Insurrectionist Female Soldier====\n'''The Insurrectionist Female Soldier''' (Hannah Hart) first appears walking down a highway with other high ranking Insurrectionists. She makes a larger appearance in the Chapter 17, where she is part of an Insurrectionist response team, sent out to stop the Freelancers on the highway. Her, the Insurrectionist Sniper and the Sleeveless Soldier follow the Freelancers Warthog using jet packs and engage them, they are unsuccessful. She prefers to dual wield pistols as her primary weapons.\n\nIn ''Season 10'', she asks why the Insurrectionists should trust C.T., who had recently defected. She removes her helmet and is revealed to be a blond, Caucasian woman. During the battle at the Insurrection base, her and the Demo Man fight Carolina and Maine on a platform. Eventually, she is knocked off but manages to grab on to the platform above the water. Maine, holding the Demo Man's disembodied, robotic arm, offers the Female a hand. She mistakes it for her fellow soldier and when she grabs it, Maine lets go and she falls down, hitting her back before falling into the water.\n\n====Insurrectionist Sleeveless Soldier====\n'''The Insurrectionist Sleeveless Soldier''' is a soldier that prefers to use brute strength over weapons. He first appears in ''Season 9'', Chapter 13, walking down a highway with other Insurrectionist leaders. In the next chapter, he appears as a member of the response team sent to stop the Freelancers from taking a briefcase. He, along with the Female Soldier and Sniper use jet packs to chase the Freelancer's Warthog. It is during this fight that the Sleeveless Soldier takes a pistol and shoots Maine in the throat, revealing how Maine became unable to speak.\n\nHe reappears in ''Season 10'' at the Insurrectionist base. When the Freelancers attack the Insurrection base, he works with the Female and the Demo Man to fight the Freelancers. He gives chase to Carolina but is stopped when a drop pod lands in between them. The door is kicked open, revealing an angered Maine inside. When his AI, Sigma, points the Soldier out to Maine as the one from the highway that shot him in the throat, Maine then punches him in the head hard enough to rip it off.\n\n====Insurrectionist Leader====\n'''The Insurrectionist Leader''' (Michael Joplin) is a high-ranking member of the Insurrection, recognized by the pill symbol on his chest. He seems to have a close relationship with C.T. as he is the only person she lets call her Connie. He first appears walking down a highway with other high-ranking Insurrectionists, carrying a briefcase. In the Chapter 19 he is seen talking to C.T. over video chat, but she is interrupted by Washington.\n\nIn ''Season 10'', he appears in the space ship graveyard along two other Insurrectionist Soldiers. While the Freelancers search for him, C.T. sneaks away to his location and hands him a data file. Later when the Freelancers search Bone Valley, the Leader commands an Insurrectionist destroyer ship, 'The Staff of Charon', and attacks the Freelancer frigate. The two ships fight but the Insurrection Leader escapes into Slipspace, leaving behind a nuclear device. However, the Freelancers and the frigate manage to escape the explosion.\n\nLater, he appears with C.T. entering the Insurrectionist base, while Wyoming spies on them. His companions aren't pleased to see C.T., as they distrust her. When the Freelancers attack, C.T. is surprised that her \"friends\" found her so fast and the two overlook the battle through cameras. While he and C.T. head to a bunker, he notices Florida up on a ledge. He throws a tomahawk at him, knocking him off. Suddenly, Wyoming snipes at him, shooting him in the foot, causing him and C.T. to retreat. While C.T. proposes that they leave to escape the Freelancers, he refuses to leave without his teammates. As the two argue, Tex and Carolina break into the bunker. While C.T. tries to explain that the Director is using the Freelancers, Tex is angered and attacks her. Eventually, Tex mortally wounds C.T., but the Leader manages to escape with C.T. in an escape pod. C.T. hands him another file, containing the location of an artifact, before dying in his arms. Stricken with grief, he puts on her helmet, revealing that he took on C.T.'s identity.\n\nThe soldier now known as C.T. appears in the desert excavation site where he claims to be working with a team of humans and aliens to uncover a structure. Tucker later reveals that he had in fact killed the actual dig crew. C.T. first appeared as the driver of an Elephant, assisting Sarge, Grif, and Caboose through an active minefield protecting the location of the temple. He appeared in the following chapter physically and introduced one of his alien \"co-workers\", Smith. He allows the trio to scavenge spare parts to fix their jeep so they can depart swiftly, but secretly makes plans to \"deal with\" them to Smith. When the temple door opens, he leads the dig team to try to kill Tucker, but is forced to call a retreat. After breaching the temple, C.T. manages to capture Epsilon-Church, angering the Aliens and causing them to revolt. C.T. flees the temple with Epsilon-Church while the Reds, Blues, and the Aliens give chase. Eventually the Reds and Blues catch up, destroy C.T.'s jeep, and he is finally killed by Epsilon-Church after refusing to reveal his identity.\n\n====Insurrection Turret Soldiers====\n'''The Insurrectionist Turret Soldiers''' (Michael Jones and Lindsay Tuggey) are a pair Insurrection soldiers that wield large turrets. One has a happy face painted on their visor and turret while the other has a sad face, and they both carry ammo canisters on their back. One of them first appears in ''Season 10'', Chapter 7, spray painting a turret yellow. In Chapter 9, they appear again, guarding C.T. and the Insurrection Leader. Wyoming and Florida watch from above, but the Leader notices Florida and throws a tomahawk at him, causing him to fall. The Leader then orders the two Turret Soldiers to suppress the area. Carolina, York and Wash soon join the fight and attempt to figure out how to bypass the soldiers when a cloaked Tex sprints past them. In anger, Carolina follows Tex using her Super Speed leaving the rest to fend for themselves. However, Florida picks himself up and uses a grenade launcher to shoot a crane holding a crate, knocking the two Turret Soldiers off of the platform. The crate then falls on the two killing them, and leaving a large yellow stain from their paint canisters.\n\n===Recurring unaffiliated characters===\n====Andy====\nBuilt by Tex, '''Andy''', full name Andrew D. Kaboom, (Nathan Zellner)<ref name=\"S4DVDProfiles\">[[Rooster Teeth Productions]] (2006). Character profiles. In ''[[Red vs. Blue (season 4)|Red vs. Blue Season Four]]'' [DVD]. Buda, Texas: Rooster Teeth Productions.</ref> is the short-tempered, rude, and vulgar [[bomb]]. Andy often expresses a desire to detonate himself to solve a problem, much to the worry the teams, who attempt to calm him down. Andy is apparently self-conscious about his weight. In {{rvbep|75|episode 75}}, after O'Malley repeatedly calls him \"bowling ball\", Andy asks Caboose if this is true, claiming that he has been working out. When Sarge steals Andy, he remarks that Andy is much lighter than the last time he tried to pick him up, and Andy is relieved that someone has noticed. Since Andy was built from parts of an old robot, he is able to speak. He also understands the Alien's language, and rest of the group use him to act as a [[translation|translator]]. In {{rvbep|76|Episode 76}}, the Reds steal Andy to translate a recording for them, which is stored in Lopez, but is in Spanish.\n\nLater, he was taken by O'Malley, then possessing Captain Flowers, but was left in the caves with Lopez after Flowers learned enough Alien language to get by. The Red team returns to pick him up in Episode 100 and plant him in the ship as a contingency plan. They order him to detonate if O'Malley tries to escape in the ship. O'Malley does so, so Andy detonates, seemingly killing everyone on board. Andy's fate is expanded upon somewhat in the [[Red vs. Blue: Reconstruction#Chapter 5|Chapter 5]] of ''Reconstruction''. Andy did explode, but while the blast did not destroy him, it caused major damage to the ship. Andy's fate after the crash landing is unknown.\n\nHe appears briefly in Season 9, in the Epsilon unit, where he is placed by Tex in the middle of the Reds. He then counts down, but to his dismay, does not explode.\n\nIn the Season 11 Episode \"Finders Keepers\" Tuckers voicemail system took him to Andy's and Quotes \"Hi you've reached the voicemail of Andy the bomb\".\n\nIn the Season 4 DVD commentary, the series creators stated that they originally wanted to explain Andy's rudeness by making him bitter about being rejected by Sheila, but it was never incorporated into the series.\n\n====Alien====\n<!-- FAIR USE of RvB_Alien.JPG: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:RvB_Alien.jpg for rationale -->[[Image:RvB Alien.JPG|250px|right|thumb|The Alien.]]\nAppearing for the first time at the end of Season 3, the '''Alien''' (Nathan Zellner)<ref name=\"Elite\">Although the Alien is a [[Covenant (Halo)#Elites (Sangheili)|Covenant Elite]] in the context of ''Halo'', he is never acknowledged as an Elite in ''Red vs. Blue''.</ref> scares Church out of his body after it wiped out Lopez's robot army single-handedly. This prompts the Blues to attempt to hunt him down, but they suffer a series of humiliating defeats. Even Tex is cut down seconds after attempting to attack the Alien, and, like Church, is forced to flee her body. Eventually, however, Caboose manages to befriend the Alien, who had found him unpalatable after biting him once. Conversely, the Alien has a strong odor to the Blues, who describe the smell with a series of unpleasant analogies.\n\nThe Alien has a habit of staying crouched, and its language appears to consist entirely of \"blarg\" and \"honk\". It seems to understand English, as it responds to other characters when they speak English, but it is unable to speak English itself. The Blues suggest a variety of names for the Alien including \"Crunch-bite\", \"Fluffy\", and \"Honk-Honk\". Gary later claims that the Alien is a member of the species that built him, though this later proves to be a lie.\n\nThe Alien reveals in Episodes {{rvbep|63|63}} and {{rvbep|64|64}} that he was on a quest to retrieve the sword that Tucker had discovered so that he could save his race from extinction. When the Alien first spots Tucker with the sword, he begins beat Tucker to a pulp relentlessly, upset that Tucker had discovered the sword first, as the sword only works for its original finder. The Alien consequently forces Tucker to join him on his quest, threatening to kill everyone otherwise. In {{rvbep|71|71}}, when the team reaches the temple in the Great Freezing Plains, the Alien has Tucker use the sword to unlock the gates to an alien ship. The Alien takes off in the ship, but he is almost immediately killed by Wyoming.\n\nIn {{rvbep|69}}, Tucker complains that the Alien is always standing over him when he awakes. Tex assumes that the Alien is simply obsessing over the sword. However, Andy accidentally reveals that the Alien's race reproduces by implanting [[parasite|parasitic]] [[embryo]]s in other beings. Soon after, Tucker gives birth to the \"baby\" or Junior who is heard off-camera speaking in higher-pitched \"honks\" and \"blargs\". In {{rvbep|99|99}} Tucker explains that the Alien's prophecy concerning the sword providing salvation for the Aliens did not fail with his death; instead, Junior, the son of Tucker and the Alien, is the intended savior of the Alien race.\n\nIn ''Revelation'', it was revealed that the Alien's claims of a \"prophecy\" was all a ruse. The entire plot of the ''Blood Gulch Chronicles'' was a simulation battle test for Freelancers, in this case, specifically for Tex.\n\n====Grunts and Red Zealot====\nThe '''Grunts'''<ref name=\"S3DVDComment\"/> (voiced by Rooster Teeth's members with altered pitches) are a group of eternally [[spawning (computer gaming)|respawning]] Reds and Blues originally from Battle Creek. Initially engaged in [[Capture the flag|Capture the Flag]], the group parodies the multiplayer mode of ''Halo'' and the stereotypical behaviors of online [[gamer]]s, using terms like \"rocket whore,\" \"[[camping (computer gaming)|camper]]\", and \"[[newbie|noob]].\" Once a match ends and everyone dies, they all inexplicably come back to life and immediately start another match. They downright worship the flag, with one of them in particular, '''The Red Zealot''' (Burnie Burns) having a far more religious mindset than his comrades do, and his fast-paced speech consists almost entirely of [[Bible|Biblical]]-type quotes and religious [[dogma]] all pertaining to flags, often speaking about [[crusade]]s and [[promised land]]s during battles.\n\nSarge and Caboose first encounter the Grunts near the beginning of Season 3. They become held up in the group's endless firefights, but eventually escape with Simmons' help. Simmons later teleports the group to Sidewinder and convinces them to attack O'Malley by claiming that he has their flag, but they are caught in the explosion with the rest of the characters. The Red Zealot later teams up with O'Malley after being separated from the other Grunts, having been convinced the rogue AI is the guardian of the Holy Temple. O'Malley, Doc, and Lopez find him annoying, but tolerate him because he performs menial tasks without complaint. The Zealot is killed by Tucker shortly after he finds the energy sword. Later on, the Grunts teams are seen working together to guard the temple in the Great Freezing Plains, but they still exchange [[trash talk]] with each other over armor color. They are all soon wiped out by Tex.\n\nIn Season 15, the Grunts are shown under the service of Temple. After Wash is shot in a firefight, Caboose proceeds to attack the Grunts in a rage.\n\n====FH57====\nFH57 were a group of Red simulation troopers who appeared in season 14 they were at war with AH13 blue team until they were killed by an Alien space craft that crashed into there base . Using the ship they search for more blue soldiers for months until finding life signs from Blood Gulch where they found the Reds and Blues and tried to make a plan to attack the Blue base by using there tank to kill the soldiers until they were found by Caboose  who told them that it already happened when he accidentally team killed the leader. Returning back to the ship after telling Caboose not to tell his teammates that they were here they returned to their ship which accidentally activated the self-destruction killing them.\n\nColonel Turf (Bruce Greene) was the reckless leader of FH57 who was determined to use the alien ship to hunt down and eradicate all the Blues in the galaxy.\n\nPrivate Sue (Lawrence Sonntag) was a red simulation trooper that was part of squad FH57. He was shown to be rather blunt expechally when confronted by Caboose in Blood Gulch and never seems to be too concerned with the situations he is presented with.\n\nLieutenant Drag (James Willems) was the \"cynical asshat\" of the red squad known as FH57.\n\nCaptain Morgan (Adam Kovic) was a member of the FH57 red team. Morgan is one of the smarter members of the group as he preferred to think things over and plan things out as opposed to rushing in. His name and rank is a reference to a brand of Rum.\n\nMajor Santos (Joel Rubin) was a member of the FH57 red team. Santos\u2019s is shown to be handy with mechanics and for some reason had an obsession with wine bars. Because of this, he took advantage of Peake's alien cult to stage a mutiny however after hearing a motivation speech from Turf he and Peake stopped the mutiny and was happy when Turf said that there can be room on the ship for a wine shelf.\n\nPrivate Peake (Matt Peake) was the quiet member of the red squad known as FH57. Inside the alien ship Peake discovered several aliens living in the cargo hold, and after giving them food he became their grand leader. He alongside Santos attempted a mutiny as they were both fed up by their leader Turf's current actions however after hearing a motivation speech from Turf he and Santos stopped the mutiny.\n\nCherry (Elyse Willems) was an alien ship AI that was repaired by Santos who assisted FH57 on their travels to find blue soldiers. However she had technical problems that caused her to misunderstand verbal commands causing her to initiate the self destruction after mishearing Turf saying shelf-construction killing her and the rest of FH57.\n\n====Other Alien====\nWhen Captain Flowers returned as O'Malley's new host, he brought with him a new alien partner, referred to as the '''Other Alien''' on his DVD profile. In Episode 97 it was revealed that the Other Alien is seeking the original Alien for unknown reasons, and it revived Captain Flowers to assist him. The pair of them then begin searching for Junior as well. Flowers is working with O'Malley, Vic Jr. and Wyoming to exploit the Alien's race, however Flowers' dialogue with Vic Jr. reveals that the Other Alien is unaware of this fact. The Other Alien follows O'Malley and Junior onto the ship in {{rvbep|100}}. In ''Reconstruction'', when Washington and the Blues were looking over the footage from the crashed Pelican, a door is heard opening and Tex says \"Wait, where are they going? Close the hatch.\" And the Alien, and Junior were not found on the ship, implying that the Other Alien escaped with Junior to safety.\n\n====Smith====\n'''Smith''' (Jack Pattillo) is one of the Aliens working with the soldier known as C.T., and he appears to be second in command. On his first appearance he is disturbed by the arrival of Sarge, Grif and Caboose. In ''Recreation'' Chapter 18 he beats down Jones in retaliation for shooting Epsilon-Church, and when C.T. flees with Epsilon-Church, Smith gives chase, but is taken out when C.T. destroys his vehicle. He survives, however, and is seen standing in front of the temple at the end of the scene. Later in ''Revelation'', he is seen, along with the other aliens, worshipping Epsilon-Church. He is eventually killed along with the rest of the aliens by Washington and The Meta.\n\n====Allison====\n'''Allison Church''' (Lindsay Hicks) was the Director's loved one that had died in a war, whose physical appearance in ''Season 10'' marks the first character portrayed by a live action actor instead of an animation. Her death has haunted the Director ever since then and when the Alpha AI was created the memory of her was so strong it created a 'shadow' of her Which gave The Director the idea of fragmenting the Alpha). This 'shadow' was put in a robotic body, given the codename Tex, retaining the memories of Allison. The Director remembered Allison for her failure to survive and therefore, Tex is always destined to fail, no matter how close she may be to victory.\n\nIn ''Season 10'', Tex and Carolina were about to fight in the training room, when the Director notices. The Director, worried about Tex, called out \"No! Allison!\". This caused all the AIs in the area to begin muttering 'Allison' due to them also having memories of Allison from the Alpha. Later in the season, Washington was implanted with Epsilon. As Epsilon's memories were also from the Alpha, when Wash was given Epsilon, he immediately began having flash memories of a conversation the Director had with Allison before she went off to war.\n\nIn the epilogue of \"Season 10,\" Carolina talks to Epsilon-Church about her mother. She says her mother was gone a lot, and it seemed like she always had important things to do, but her mother never said goodbye. Carolina explains that her mother disliked goodbyes because the person wasn't really gone, they just weren't there right now. This interaction strongly implies that Allison is indeed Carolina's mother, and\u2014as implied by her green eyes and the Director's last words to her, \"You were my greatest creation\"\u2014that Leonard Church is her father.\n\n====Siris====\n'''Siris'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/RoosterTeeth/status/752498928499642368|title=Rooster Teeth on Twitter|access-date=2016-10-03}}</ref> ([[Christopher Sabat]]), full name Mason Wu,  appears in Episodes 9, 10 and 11 of ''Season 14,'' as part of a three-part story centered around Locus and Felix before the events of the Chorus trilogy. He is a bounty hunter working with Locus and Felix to apprehend criminals and bring them to custody as a way to make money to support his wife, Megan. He aids them in the capture of Gabriel Lozano, son of mafia boss Reuben Lozano, and later finds out that his criminal record was erased. When Felix suggests holding Gabriel for ransom for more than he was initially worth, Siris objects at first, but reluctantly accepts. When Reuben threatens to kill the bounty hunters (or their loved ones, should they escape), disowns Gabriel, and reveals he knows their hiding location, Siris attempts to back out of the mission to defend his family, but ultimately stays, assisting them in killing Reuben and his henchmen. The very next morning, the three decide to pawn Reuben's limousine to cover the original equipment costs. He is the sniper on the team, and is in charge of surveillance and support.\n\n====Interstellar Daily====\n\n\n====Dylan Andrews====\nDylan Andrews (Anna Margaret Hollyman) is an investigative journalist for the ''Interstellar Daily'', who while reporting on attacks seemingly caused by the Reds and Blues, does not believe the Blood Gulch Crew did them, due to having previously written an article (shown in Season 12) about how the Reds and Blues, along with Carolina and Washington, took down Project Freelancer and their subsequent pardon. Her search for the truth on what apparently turned the Reds and Blues from hapless heroes to cold-blooded criminals is the main focus of Season 15. In her investigation that starts on Blood Gulch, where Dylan removes VIC from his mainframe promising to delete him after he helped her, Dylan meets the Reds and Blues, helps them find the true perpetrators, the Blues and Reds, and is apprehended by Loco and Temple once she finds out they have ulterior motives. She is eventually freed and helps the Blood Gulch Crew in the final battle against the Blues and Reds.\n\nAt the beginning of ''the Shisno Paradox'' Dylan and Jax remain behind on the island to clear the Reds and Blues name with the police, as the UNSC still believes they are terrorists. She later calls Carolina to inform that the soldiers have seemingly time travel due to the discovery of ancient art pieces inspired by the Reds and Blues.\n\n====Jax Jonez====\nJax Jonez (Joe Nicolosi) is a [[film school]] student brought by his uncle, ''Interstellar Daily'' editor Carlos Trabka (Bill Wise), to be Dylan's new cameraman. However, instead of just doing his job, Jax is constantly trying out new filming techniques and forgetting things. He claims he is good at accidentally finding things that \"advance the plot.\" After being captured by Temple, he is shot in the knee when he angers him. Still, Jax participates in the final battle against the Blues and Reds.\n\nIn ''the Shisno Paradox'', Jax is directing a film about the events of Season 15, whose production is troubled by the Reds and Blues\u2019 time traveling shenanigans. Jax is depicted here as having become a deranged, mood swinging prima donna who threatens his crew, particularly his producer Kohan Wooter (a caricature of Rooster Teeth producer Koen Wooten, who even provides the voice). Jax eventually bankrupts the film when he uses time travel to add in famous film actors from the past, and is hit with a hammer by Atlus when trying to get a time travel machine to get funding from the past.\n\n====Spencer Porkensenson====\nSpencer Porkensenson (Jason Marnocha) Is a process server who first appears in season 15 episode 2 The Cronicle following Dylan and Jax  to find Lavernius Tucker. He later fought in a firefight with the Blue and Reds mistakenly believing that Bucky was Tucker. In the episode Nightmare On Planet Evil he finally finds Tucker who tells him that he was sent by Chorus to serve him Tucker believes that he is his bodyguard manservant until he tells him that You've Been Served child support papers by the new mothers of Chorus much to his horror. Completing his mission he bids the Reds and blues farewell as he will not be seeing them again unless it\u2019s in service of the court and tells them his name and that he lives to serve and flies away.\n\n====Cyclops====\nCyclops, or C.C.(Katie Newville), is a large Cyclops Mark II-class military assault droid that was located inside the UNSC Hand Of Merope .It was later found by Sarge who wanted to take it back to base and destroy Freckles as he deemed it a threat however it was to big to bring back in one piece so the Reds dismantle it, and took it back to base to be reassembled. While bringing the parts back to base Grif loses various pieces of the robot forcing Sarge to use the parts he has to reconstruct the robot resulting in it being Mantis-sized. When Sarge activated Cyclops it spoke its name with a female voice making them call it a girl. Before Sarge was about to order her to attack Freckles she threatened the Reds as she had a hardware malfunction believing that there are 16 hostile in the canyon and was about to attack the Reds but shuts down due to Sarge converting her fuel tank to diesel resulting in her running out of power. Cyclops was later repaired by Lopez and Lopez 2.0 but was taken over by Dos.0 who used her to attack Sarge and the Reds and Blues but was later destroyed by Donut who teleported Cyclops and Dos.0 to a mine field killing them.\n\n====Epsilon Doubles====\nThe Epsilon Doubles are the main characters of season 9. When Epsilon-Church entered the Epsilon unit to look for Tex after the events of season 8, he recreated Blood Gulch by using the Alpha\u2019s memories while creating copies of the Reds and Blues. The doubles are similar to the real Reds and Blues, despite acting different at first.\n\nSarge (\u03b5) differs from his real-world counterpart in that he doesn\u2019t hate Grif, is not willing to yell at the other Reds, and allows Donut to give orders. However, after having a private conversation with Donut that lasts a couple of hours, Sarge reverts to his original personality.\n\nSimmons (\u03b5) is nearly identical to his real life counterpart. He expresses that he \"hates when things change\" as his teammates obtain their original personalities. When he is about to be killed by Andy (\u03b5), he reveals that he respects none of his teammates.\n\nDonut (\u03b5), described by Epsilon as being a \"repressed, over-achieving jarhead,\" orders Sarge and Simmons around when he first appears. He acts violent, wanting to shoot Epsilon on sight rather allowing him to speak. Donut (\u03b5), like his real-world counterpart, keeps a diary. He makes sexual innuendos for much of the time he spends onscreen. After talking with Sarge, he reverts back to his original personality.\n\nGrif (\u03b5) is unlike his real-world counterpart in that he appears to be a hard worker. When asked by Simmons to take a break, he claims to be unfamiliar with the concept. he was an extreme neat-freak, shouting at Donut for tracking mud on Red Base's recently waxed floor. It has been hinted that Grif has OCD, which is indicated after he says that doing things 3 times is fun and was hinted to be a germaphobe. when Grif had a break Donut again tracked mud into the base but instead of shouting at him again he told him that he didn\u2019t care saying that he\u2019s on break returning to his original personality.\n\nLopez (\u03b5) personality was originally very robotic and monotone, as he has only been seen going through his activation speech and alerting everyone of an earthquake however he also hates the Reds due to there stupidly and not understanding him.\n\nTucker (\u03b5) personality is the same as his real world counterpart being very foul mouthed, annoying, and perverted in the eyes of other characters however he has a better relationship with Caboose.\n\nCaboose (\u03b5) personality is the same as his real world counterpart being loving and wanting Church's friendship however he has a better relationship with Tucker.\n\n====Caboose's Mental Images====\nCaboose's mental images are a small group of characters based on the main characters however they all have different personality than their real-world counterparts and behaved depending on how Caboose sees them in reality.\n\n'''Mr. Caboose'''\n\nMr Caboose is the smart polite leader of Blue Team the exact opposite of the real Caboose\n\n'''Tucker'''\n\nTucker is the dumb, butt-sniffing coward who uses the same energy sword that the real Tucker uses except that anyone can use it due to Caboose not understanding that the sword is lock to him.\n\n'''Leonard'''\n\nLeonard (Church) is Caboose loud foul-mouthed best friend who was killed by O'Malley resulting in Caboose temporary losing any memory of the real Church.\n\n'''Sister'''\n\nSister also known as Yellow Church is Caboose's twisted version of Sister and Church which Caboose believes to be Church's twin brother.\n\n'''Sarge'''\n\nSarge is the stern and regimented leader of the Red Team who speaks with both a pirate accent and a cockney accent.\n\n'''Simon'''\n\nSimon (Simmons) is the weak-kneed sycophant with a shrill voice and a bad memory.\n\n'''Orangish Guy Whose Name I Really Don't Remember\n'''\nOrangish Guy Whose Name I Really Don't Remember (Grif) is the drunk whose name is always forgotten or mispronounced. Unlike his real Self Orangish Guy Whose Name I Really Don't Remember armor colour is yellow.\n\n'''The Girl on the Red Team\n'''\nThe Girl on the Red Team (Donut) is a teenage girl who mistakenly thinks that her rifle is a purse and having a crush on Caboose.\n\n'''Agent Washingtub\n'''\nAgent Washingtub(Washington) is a superhero who portrays himself in a clear and consistent manner while using his freelancer powers to scare those trying to help him and to fight monsters and scary people from the future.\n\n==References ==\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official website|http://rvb.roosterteeth.com/|''Red vs Blue'' official website}}\n* [http://www.roostertooths.com/ RoosterTooths.com \u2013 an unofficial ''Red vs Blue'' resource website]\n\n{{Red vs. Blue}}\n{{Rooster Teeth Productions}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Red Vs.

He leads a group of young pilots who risk their lives flying through dangerous weather and over treacherous terrain to deliver air mail. When Joe Barnes ([[Ward Bond]]) crashes at the base, the other pilots attempt to retrieve the precious mail from the burning wreckage. Mike consoles his girlfriend Ruth (Gloria Stuart), who is also Joe's sister. Mike now realizes that he has to hire a replacement, the reckless \"Duke\" Talbot (Pat O'Brien).\n\nDuke is a good pilot, but his bravado and affair with Irene ([[Lilian Bond]]), wife of fellow pilot \"Dizzy\" Wilkins ([[Russell Hopton]]), has the potential to cause irreparable damage to the tightly knit group of aviators. When Dizzy crashes and dies in a blinding snow storm, Mike is forced to take over the last leg of his flight, even though doctors have told him that his vision has deteriorated. When he also crashes during a blizzard, his distress call reveals that he is still alive, but trapped in an inaccessible mountain valley. Duke considers the rescue as a challenge, commandeering an aircraft and flying to the remote valley. He lands roughly, damaging his aircraft, but manages to fly out with Mike on board. As they reach Desert Airport, Duke knows he cannot land safely so he pushes Mike out before he crash-lands. As the ground crew pull him out of the wreck, Duke is badly injured, but alive.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Ralph Bellamy]] as Mike Miller\n* [[Gloria Stuart]] as Ruth Barnes\n* [[Pat O'Brien (actor)|Pat O'Brien]] as \"Duke\" Talbot\n* [[Slim Summerville]] as \"Slim\" McCune (as \"Slim\" Summerville)\n* [[Lilian Bond]] as Irene Wilkins\n* [[Russell Hopton]] as \"Dizzy\" Wilkins\n* [[David Landau (actor)|David Landau]] as \"Pop\"\n* [[Leslie Fenton]] as Tony Dressel\n* [[Frank Albertson]] as Tommy Bogan\n* Hans Fuerberg as \"Heinie\" Kramer\n* [[Thomas Carrigan]] as \"Sleepy\" Collins (as Tom Carrigan)\n* William Daly as \"Tex\" Lane{{#tag:ref|Ward Bond and character actor [[George Irving (American actor)|George Irving]] appeared in uncredited roles.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0022615/fullcredits?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm \"Credits: Air Mail (1932).\"] ''[[IMDb]]''.

A special stage was built to film miniature scenes where a gantry was constructed above the stage to allow models to fly over a large miniature set.{{#tag:ref|Universal \"John Fulton\"  Stage 27 also contains a large water tank and is still in operation.|group=Note}}\n\nFor ''Air Mail'', pilot [[Paul Mantz]] outbid other pilots from the [[Associated Motion Picture Pilots]], leading to a contract dispute that was taken to the [[American Federation of Labor]]. The decision to allow non-union member Mantz and his team of pilots to fly was dependent on an equal number of union pilots being hired for non-flying duties.<ref>Wynne 1987, p. 123.</ref> Mantz flew a Curtiss-Wright Travel Air Model 16K in a spectacular stunt, flying through a hangar at the [[Eastern Sierra Regional Airport|Bishop Airport]], [[Bishop, California]].<ref>Dwiggins 1967, pp. 47\u201348.</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n''Air Mail'' was well received in an era not far removed from a time when air mail pilots like [[Charles Lindbergh]] were idolized. Critical reviews praised the atmospheric settings and flying scenes, but had difficulties with the underlying personal dramas. In his review in ''[[The New York Times]]'', Mourdant Hall noted, \" 'Air Mail' is handicapped by sequences that are either too long or too melodramatic, but it atones partly for these shortcomings by interesting details of activities in a flying-station, which in this instance happens to be known as Desert Airport. This curious combination of compelling truths and incredible fiction has a group of characters who, as usual in similar tales, are either too noble or too shameful or callous.\"<ref>Hall, Mourdant. [https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9905E7DC1131E633A25754C0A9679D946394D6CF \"Air Mail (1932); Pat O'Brien as a boastful pilot in a story of the hazards of the modern \"Pony Express.\"] ''[[The New York Times]]'', November 7, 1932.</ref>\n\nThe review in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' echoed similar concerns. \"(The) Picture is a fund of interesting atmosphere about the air mail service. Radio exchanges are coming in and going out all the time, couched in technical language such as 'Visibility zero, ceiling zero. Caution to all planes.'

He leads a group of young pilots who risk their lives flying through dangerous weather and over treacherous terrain to deliver air mail. When Joe Barnes ([[Ward Bond]]) crashes at the base, the other pilots attempt to retrieve the precious mail from the burning wreckage. Mike consoles his girlfriend Ruth (Gloria Stuart), who is also Joe's sister. Mike now realizes that he has to hire a replacement, the reckless \"Duke\" Talbot (Pat O'Brien).\n\nDuke is a good pilot, but his bravado and affair with Irene ([[Lilian Bond]]), wife of fellow pilot \"Dizzy\" Wilkins ([[Russell Hopton]]), has the potential to cause irreparable damage to the tightly knit group of aviators. When Dizzy crashes and dies in a blinding snow storm, Mike is forced to take over the last leg of his flight, even though doctors have told him that his vision has deteriorated. When he also crashes during a blizzard, his distress call reveals that he is still alive, but trapped in an inaccessible mountain valley. Duke considers the rescue as a challenge, commandeering an aircraft and flying to the remote valley. He lands roughly, damaging his aircraft, but manages to fly out with Mike on board. As they reach Desert Airport, Duke knows he cannot land safely so he pushes Mike out before he crash-lands. As the ground crew pull him out of the wreck, Duke is badly injured, but alive.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Ralph Bellamy]] as Mike Miller\n* [[Gloria Stuart]] as Ruth Barnes\n* [[Pat O'Brien (actor)|Pat O'Brien]] as \"Duke\" Talbot\n* [[Slim Summerville]] as \"Slim\" McCune (as \"Slim\" Summerville)\n* [[Lilian Bond]] as Irene Wilkins\n* [[Russell Hopton]] as \"Dizzy\" Wilkins\n* [[David Landau (actor)|David Landau]] as \"Pop\"\n* [[Leslie Fenton]] as Tony Dressel\n* [[Frank Albertson]] as Tommy Bogan\n* Hans Fuerberg as \"Heinie\" Kramer\n* [[Thomas Carrigan]] as \"Sleepy\" Collins (as Tom Carrigan)\n* William Daly as \"Tex\" Lane{{#tag:ref|Ward Bond and character actor [[George Irving (American actor)|George Irving]] appeared in uncredited roles.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0022615/fullcredits?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm \"Credits: Air Mail (1932).\"] ''[[IMDb]]''.

A special stage was built to film miniature scenes where a gantry was constructed above the stage to allow models to fly over a large miniature set.{{#tag:ref|Universal \"John Fulton\"  Stage 27 also contains a large water tank and is still in operation.|group=Note}}\n\nFor ''Air Mail'', pilot [[Paul Mantz]] outbid other pilots from the [[Associated Motion Picture Pilots]], leading to a contract dispute that was taken to the [[American Federation of Labor]]. The decision to allow non-union member Mantz and his team of pilots to fly was dependent on an equal number of union pilots being hired for non-flying duties.<ref>Wynne 1987, p. 123.</ref> Mantz flew a Curtiss-Wright Travel Air Model 16K in a spectacular stunt, flying through a hangar at the [[Eastern Sierra Regional Airport|Bishop Airport]], [[Bishop, California]].<ref>Dwiggins 1967, pp. 47\u201348.</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n''Air Mail'' was well received in an era not far removed from a time when air mail pilots like [[Charles Lindbergh]] were idolized. Critical reviews praised the atmospheric settings and flying scenes, but had difficulties with the underlying personal dramas. In his review in ''[[The New York Times]]'', Mourdant Hall noted, \" 'Air Mail' is handicapped by sequences that are either too long or too melodramatic, but it atones partly for these shortcomings by interesting details of activities in a flying-station, which in this instance happens to be known as Desert Airport. This curious combination of compelling truths and incredible fiction has a group of characters who, as usual in similar tales, are either too noble or too shameful or callous.\"<ref>Hall, Mourdant.

Radio exchanges are coming in and going out all the time, couched in technical language such as 'Visibility zero, ceiling zero. Caution to all planes.'

These were collectively referred to as the \"Punjab Hill States\". These small states, ruled by [[Rajput|Rajput kings]], were variously independent, vassals of the [[Mughal Empire]] since the time of [[Akbar|Emperor Akbar]] or sometimes controlled from [[Kangra State|Kangra state]] in the Himachal area. Following the decline of the Mughals, turbulence in Kangra and invasions of Gorkhas, the hill states fell successively under the control of the Sikhs under [[Ranjit Singh]].<ref name=\"HutchisonVogel1933\">{{cite book|last1=Hutchison|first1=J.|last2=Vogel|first2=Jean Philippe|title=History of the Panjab Hill States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5uXgQwAACAAJ|accessdate=23 October 2011|year=1933|publisher=Superint., Gov.

In the [[Treaty of Lahore]] of 1846, the Sikhs were made to surrender the valuable region (the Jullundur Doab) between the [[Beas River]] and the [[Sutlej River]] and required to pay an indemnity of 1.2 million rupees. Because they could not readily raise this sum, the East India Company allowed the [[Dogra]] ruler [[Gulab Singh]] to acquire Kashmir from the Sikh kingdom in exchange for making a payment of 750,000 rupees to the Company. Gulab Singh became the first [[Maharaja]] of the newly formed [[princely state]] of [[Jammu and Kashmir]],<ref name=\"Srinagar\">[https://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/apac/photocoll/g/019pho000000394u00076000.html Srinagar] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304072804/http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/apac/photocoll/g/019pho000000394u00076000.html |date=4 March 2016 }} www.collectbritain.co.uk.</ref> founding a [[The Royal House of Jammu and Kashmir|dynasty]], that was to rule the state, the second-largest principality during the [[British Raj]], until India gained its independence in 1947.\n\n==Partition of India==\n{{Main article|Partition of India}}\n[[File:Partition of India 1947 en.svg|thumb|right|Partition of India and the movement of refugees]]\nThe years 1946\u20131947 saw the rise of [[All-India Muslim League]] and [[Muslim nationalism in South Asia|Muslim nationalism]], demanding a separate state for India's Muslims. The demand took a violent turn on the [[Direct Action Day]] (16 August 1946) and inter-communal violence between Hindus and Muslims became endemic. Consequently, a decision was taken on 3 June 1947 to divide [[British India]] into two separate states, the [[Dominion of Pakistan]] comprising the Muslim majority areas and the [[Dominion of India]] comprising the rest. The two provinces [[Punjab]] and [[Bengal]] with large Muslim-majority areas were to be divided between the two dominions. An estimated 11 million people eventually migrated between the two parts of Punjab, and possibly 1 million perished in the inter-communal violence. Jammu and Kashmir, being adjacent to the Punjab province, was directly affected by the happenings in Punjab.\n\n[[File:Auchinleck.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Field Marshal [[Claude Auchinleck]], Supreme Commander of Indian and Pakistani armed forces]]\nThe original target date for the transfer of power to the new dominions was June 1948. However, fearing the rise of inter-communal violence, the British Viceroy [[Lord Mountbatten]] advanced the date to 15 August 1947. This gave only 6 weeks to complete all the arrangements for partition.{{sfn|Hodson, The Great Divide|1969|pp=293,&nbsp;320}} Mountbatten's original plan was to stay on the joint Governor General for both the dominions till June 1948. However, this was not accepted by the Pakistani leader [[Mohammad Ali Jinnah]]. In the event, Mountbatten stayed on as the Governor General of India, whereas Pakistan chose Jinnah as its Governor General.{{sfn|Hodson, The Great Divide|1969|pp=293,&nbsp;329\u2013330}} It was envisaged that the nationalisation of the armed forces could not be completed by 15 August.{{efn|At the beginning of 1947, all the posts above the rank of lieutenant colonel in the army were held by British officers.{{sfn|Sarila, The Shadow of the Great Game|2007|p=324}} Pakistan had only four lieutenant colonels,{{sfn|Barua, Gentlemen of the Raj|2003|p=133}} two of whom were involved in the Kashmir conflict: Akbar Khan and Sher Khan.{{sfn|Nawaz, The First Kashmir War Revisited|2008}} At the beginning of the war, India had about 500 British officers and Pakistan over 1000.{{sfn|Ankit, Kashmir, 1945\u201366|2014|p=43}}}} Hence British officers stayed on after the transfer of power. The service chiefs were appointed by the Dominion governments and were responsible to them. The overall administrative control, but not operational control, was vested with Field Marshal [[Claude Auchinleck]], who was titled the 'Supreme Commander', answerable to a newly formed Joint Defence Council of the two dominions. India appointed General [[Rob Lockhart]] as its Army chief and Pakistan appointed General [[Frank Messervy]].{{sfn|Hodson, The Great Divide|1969|pp=262\u2013265}}\n\nThe presence of the British commanding officers on both sides made the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947 a strange war. The two commanding officers were in daily telephone contact and adopted mutually defensive positions. The attitude was that \"you can hit them so hard but not too hard, otherwise there will be all kinds of repercussions.\"{{sfn|Ankit, Kashmir, 1945\u201366|2014|pp=54,&nbsp;56}} Both Lockhart and Messervy were replaced in the course of war, and their successors [[Roy Bucher]] and [[Douglas Gracey]] tried to exercise restraint on their respective governments. Roy Bucher was apparently successful in doing so in India, but Gracey yielded and let British officers be used in operational roles on the side of Pakistan. One British officer even died in action.{{sfn|Ankit, Kashmir, 1945\u201366|2014|pp=57\u201358}}\n\n==Developments in Jammu and Kashmir (August\u2013October 1947)==\n[[File:Sir Hari Singh Bahadur, Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir, 1944.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Maharaja Hari Singh]] of [[Jammu and Kashmir (princely state)|Jammu and Kashmir]]]]\nWith the independence of the Dominions, the [[British Paramountcy]] over the princely states came to an end. The rulers of the states were advised to join one of the two dominions by executing an [[Instrument of Accession]]. [[Maharaja Hari Singh]] of Jammu and Kashmir, along with his prime minister [[Ram Chandra Kak]], decided not to accede to either dominion. The reasons cited were that the Muslim majority population of the State would not be comfortable with joining India, and that the Hindu and Sikh minorities would become vulnerable if the state joined Pakistan.{{sfn|Ankit, Henry Scott|2010|p=45}}\n\nIn 1947, the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir had a wide range of ethnic and religious communities. The [[Kashmir Division|Kashmir province]] consisting of the [[Kashmir Valley]] and the [[Muzaffarabad district]] had a majority Muslim population (over 90%). The [[Jammu Division|Jammu province]], consisting of 5 districts, had a roughly equal division of Hindus and Muslims in the eastern districts ([[Udhampur]], [[Jammu]] and [[Reasi]]) and Muslim majority in the western districts ([[Mirpur, Azad Kashmir|Mirpur]] and [[Historical Poonch District|Poonch]]). The mountainous [[Ladakh]] district (''wazarat'') in the east had a significant Buddhist presence with a Muslim majority in [[Baltistan]]. The [[Gilgit Agency]] in the north was overwhelmingly Muslim and was directly governed by the British under an agreement with the Maharaja. Shortly before the transfer of power, the British returned the Gilgit Agency to the Maharaja, who appointed a [[Dogra]] governor for the district and a British commander for the local forces.\n\n\nThe predominant political movement in the Kashmir Valley, the [[Jammu & Kashmir National Conference|National Conference]] led by [[Sheikh Abdullah]], believed in secular politics. It was allied with the [[Indian National Congress]] and was believed to favour joining India. On the other hand, the Muslims of the Jammu province supported the [[All Jammu and Kashmir Muslim Conference|Muslim Conference]], which was allied to the [[All-India Muslim League]] and favoured joining Pakistan. The Hindus of the Jammu province favoured an outright merger with India.<ref>{{citation |first=Balraj |last=Puri |authorlink=Balraj Puri |title=The Question of Accession |journal=Epilogue |volume=4 |number=11 |pp=4\u20136 |date=November 2010 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TMxJzb7N_8wC&pg=PA4 |ref={{sfnref|Puri, The Question of Accession|2010}}}}</ref> In the midst of all the diverging views, the Maharaja's decision to remain independent was apparently a judicious one.{{sfn|Ankit, Henry Scott|2010}}\n{{clear left}}\n===Operation Gulmarg plan===\n{{Location map+\n|Pakistan\n|float      = right\n|width      = 250\n|caption    = Operation Gulmarg locations\n|nodiv      = 1\n|mini       = 1\n|places     =\n{{location map~ |Pakistan |lat=34.36|N |long=73.47|E |label=Muzaffarabad |position=right |link=Muzaffarabad |mark=Blue pog.svg |marksize=4 |label_size=70}}\n{{location map~ |Pakistan |lat=33.76|N |long=74.09|E |label=Poonch |position=right |link=Poonch (town) |mark=Blue pog.svg |marksize=4 |label_size=70}}\n{{location map~ |Pakistan |lat=32.98|N |long=74.07|E |label=Bhimber |position=right |link=Bhimber |mark=Blue pog.svg |marksize=4 |label_size=70}}\n{{location map~ |Pakistan |lat=34.18|N |long=73.24|E |label=Abbottabad |position=left |link=Abbottabad |mark=Red pog.svg |marksize=4 |label_size=0}}\n{{location map~ |Pakistan |lat=34.75|N |long=72.35|E |label=Swat |position=left |link=Swat (princely state) |mark=Green pog.svg |marksize=4 |label_size=0}}\n{{location map~ |Pakistan |lat=35.20|N |long=71.88|E |label=Dir |position=left |link=Dir (princely state) |mark=Green pog.svg |marksize=4 |label_size=0}}\n{{location map~ |Pakistan |lat=35.85|N |long=71.79|E |label=Chitral |position=left |link=Chitral (princely state) |mark=Green pog.svg |marksize=4 |label_size=0}}\n{{location map~ |Pakistan |lat=32.94|N |long=70.61|E |label=Bannu |position=right |link=Bannu |mark=Red pog.svg |marksize=4 |label_size=0}}\n{{location map~ |Pakistan |lat=32.29|N |long=69.57|E |label=Wanna |position=right |link=Wanna, Pakistan |mark=Red pog.svg |marksize=4 |label_size=0}}\n{{location map~ |Pakistan |lat=33.58|N |long=71.42|E |label=Kohat |position=right |link=Kohat |Red=Red pog.svg |marksize=4 |label_size=0}}\n{{location map~ |Pakistan |lat=33.37|N |long=70.55|E |label=Thall |position=right |link=Thall |mark=Red pog.svg |marksize=4 |label_size=0}}\n{{location map~ |Pakistan |lat=34.01|N |long=71.98|E |label=Nowshera |position=right |link=Nowshera, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa |mark=Red pog.svg |marksize=4 |label_size=0}}\n{{location map~ |Pakistan |lat=35.507284|N |long=73.35631334|E |label=Indus river |position=right |link=Indus River |mark=Blue pog.svg |marksize=4 |label_size=70}}\n{{location map~ |Pakistan |lat=31.712541|N |long=74.456148|E |label=Ravi river |position=river |link=Ravi River |mark=Blue pog.svg |marksize=4 |label_size=70}}\n}}\n\nAccording to Indian military sources, the Pakistani Army prepared a plan called '''Operation Gulmarg''' and put it into action as early as 20 August, a few days after Pakistan's independence.

Despite Mountbatten's fear of a full-scale war, involving British officers on opposing sides, how could he have reasoned that it was necessary for Jammu and Kashmir \u2013 technically an independent country \u2013 to accede first before receiving military assistance? Why was no appeal made to the United Nations for assistance at that time? And why did no one suggest getting in touch with the Pakistani government in Karachi for consultation? No convincing explanation has been offered: \"It is hard to understand why Mountbatten attached such importance to immediate accession,' concludes Philip Ziegler, Mountbatten's official biographer. 'If there had been no accession, the Indian presence in Kashmir would have been more evidently temporary, the possibility of a properly constituted referendum would have become more real.

Does this vindicate the Indian Government's claim that the Maharaja's subsequent accession to India had majority support? It might, if we knew precisely what the two parties wanted, and if we could be sure that they spoke, collectively, for the Kashmiri people. But the precisely what the two parties wanted, and if we could be sure that they spoke, collectively, for the Kashmiri people. But the intentions of the party leaders in 1947 are obscure and their representativeness questionable. To take the second point first, support for Pakistan in Kashmir was by no means co-extensive with support for the MC. On the one hand some Kashmiris appear to have adopted Abbas party' mainly out of respect for Jinnah and as a vehicle through which to 'express their sentiment about Pakistan and the Muslim League'. As Ghulam Muhammad noted in a letter to Jinnah: 'The people of Srinagar are League-struck even...though they neither had nor have any faith in Mirwaiz'. On the other hand, many NC followers seem to have divided up their allegiance, acknowledging Abdullah as their leader 'up to Kohala' \u2013 that is, locally- and Jinnah beyond. Saraf remembers that it 'was a common sight in the 1940s to find the photographs of Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah and those of Allama Iqbal and Quaid-e-Azam hanging side by side in the houses or business premises of supporters of the National Conference; while League member Samseenuddin Khan, who visited Kashmir in 1945, found that the 'jewellers and ordinary folk' he spoke to regarded themselves as 'under the banner of the Muslim League' and staunch disciples of 'the Congress leader Sheikh Abdullah'.|access-date=26 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180726214858/https://books.google.com/books?id=VaeuCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA219|archive-date=26 July 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Stages of the war==\n[[File:J&K01low.jpg|right|thumb|300px|State defence of the Kashmir Valley 22 October 1947&nbsp;\u2013 26 October 1947]]\n===Initial invasion===\n\nThe first clash occurred at [[Thorar]] on 3\u20134 October 1947.<ref name=\"reg history\"/>\nOn 22 October another attack was launched in the Muzaffarabad sector.

These were collectively referred to as the \"Punjab Hill States\". These small states, ruled by [[Rajput|Rajput kings]], were variously independent, vassals of the [[Mughal Empire]] since the time of [[Akbar|Emperor Akbar]] or sometimes controlled from [[Kangra State|Kangra state]] in the Himachal area. Following the decline of the Mughals, turbulence in Kangra and invasions of Gorkhas, the hill states fell successively under the control of the Sikhs under [[Ranjit Singh]].<ref name=\"HutchisonVogel1933\">{{cite book|last1=Hutchison|first1=J.|last2=Vogel|first2=Jean Philippe|title=History of the Panjab Hill States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5uXgQwAACAAJ|accessdate=23 October 2011|year=1933|publisher=Superint., Gov.

In the [[Treaty of Lahore]] of 1846, the Sikhs were made to surrender the valuable region (the Jullundur Doab) between the [[Beas River]] and the [[Sutlej River]] and required to pay an indemnity of 1.2 million rupees. Because they could not readily raise this sum, the East India Company allowed the [[Dogra]] ruler [[Gulab Singh]] to acquire Kashmir from the Sikh kingdom in exchange for making a payment of 750,000 rupees to the Company.

The demand took a violent turn on the [[Direct Action Day]] (16 August 1946) and inter-communal violence between Hindus and Muslims became endemic. Consequently, a decision was taken on 3 June 1947 to divide [[British India]] into two separate states, the [[Dominion of Pakistan]] comprising the Muslim majority areas and the [[Union of India]] comprising the rest. The two provinces [[Punjab]] and [[Bengal]] with large Muslim-majority areas were to be divided between the two dominions. An estimated 11 million people eventually migrated between the two parts of Punjab, and possibly 1 million perished in the inter-communal violence. Jammu and Kashmir, being adjacent to the Punjab province, was directly affected by the happenings in Punjab.\n\n[[File:Auchinleck.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Field Marshal [[Claude Auchinleck]], Supreme Commander of Indian and Pakistani armed forces]]\nThe original target date for the transfer of power to the new dominions was June 1948. However, fearing the rise of inter-communal violence, the British Viceroy [[Lord Mountbatten]] advanced the date to 15 August 1947. This gave only 6 weeks to complete all the arrangements for partition.{{sfn|Hodson, The Great Divide|1969|pp=293,&nbsp;320}} Mountbatten's original plan was to stay on the joint Governor General for both the dominions till June 1948. However, this was not accepted by the Pakistani leader [[Mohammad Ali Jinnah]]. In the event, Mountbatten stayed on as the Governor General of India, whereas Pakistan chose Jinnah as its Governor General.{{sfn|Hodson, The Great Divide|1969|pp=293,&nbsp;329\u2013330}} It was envisaged that the nationalisation of the armed forces could not be completed by 15 August.{{efn|At the beginning of 1947, all the posts above the rank of lieutenant colonel in the army were held by British officers.{{sfn|Sarila, The Shadow of the Great Game|2007|p=324}} Pakistan had only four lieutenant colonels,{{sfn|Barua, Gentlemen of the Raj|2003|p=133}} two of whom were involved in the Kashmir conflict: Akbar Khan and Sher Khan.{{sfn|Nawaz, The First Kashmir War Revisited|2008}} At the beginning of the war, India had about 500 British officers and Pakistan over 1000.{{sfn|Ankit, Kashmir, 1945\u201366|2014|p=43}}}} Hence British officers stayed on after the transfer of power. The service chiefs were appointed by the Dominion governments and were responsible to them. The overall administrative control, but not operational control, was vested with Field Marshal [[Claude Auchinleck]], who was titled the 'Supreme Commander', answerable to a newly formed Joint Defence Council of the two dominions. India appointed General [[Rob Lockhart]] as its Army chief and Pakistan appointed General [[Frank Messervy]].{{sfn|Hodson, The Great Divide|1969|pp=262\u2013265}}\n\nThe presence of the British commanding officers on both sides made the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947 a strange war. The two commanding officers were in daily telephone contact and adopted mutually defensive positions. The attitude was that \"you can hit them so hard but not too hard, otherwise there will be all kinds of repercussions.\"{{sfn|Ankit, Kashmir, 1945\u201366|2014|pp=54,&nbsp;56}} Both Lockhart and Messervy were replaced in the course of war, and their successors [[Roy Bucher]] and [[Douglas Gracey]] tried to exercise restraint on their respective governments. Roy Bucher was apparently successful in doing so in India, but Gracey yielded and let British officers be used in operational roles on the side of Pakistan. One British officer even died in action.{{sfn|Ankit, Kashmir, 1945\u201366|2014|pp=57\u201358}}\n\n==Developments in Jammu and Kashmir (August\u2013October 1947)==\n[[File:Sir Hari Singh Bahadur, Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir, 1944.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Maharaja Hari Singh]] of [[Jammu and Kashmir (princely state)|Jammu and Kashmir]]]]\nWith the independence of the Dominions, the [[British Paramountcy]] over the princely states came to an end. The rulers of the states were advised to join one of the two dominions by executing an [[Instrument of Accession]]. [[Maharaja Hari Singh]] of Jammu and Kashmir, along with his prime minister [[Ram Chandra Kak]], decided not to accede to either dominion. The reasons cited were that the Muslim majority population of the State would not be comfortable with joining India, and that the Hindu and Sikh minorities would become vulnerable if the state joined Pakistan.{{sfn|Ankit, Henry Scott|2010|p=45}}\n\nIn 1947, the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir had a wide range of ethnic and religious communities. The [[Kashmir Division|Kashmir province]] consisting of the [[Kashmir Valley]] and the [[Muzaffarabad district]] had a majority Muslim population (over 90%). The [[Jammu Division|Jammu province]], consisting of 5 districts, had a roughly equal division of Hindus and Muslims in the eastern districts ([[Udhampur]], [[Jammu]] and [[Reasi]]) and Muslim majority in the western districts ([[Mirpur, Azad Kashmir|Mirpur]] and [[Historical Poonch District|Poonch]]). The mountainous [[Ladakh]] district (''wazarat'') in the east had a significant Buddhist presence with a Muslim majority in [[Baltistan]]. The [[Gilgit Agency]] in the north was overwhelmingly Muslim and was directly governed by the British under an agreement with the Maharaja. Shortly before the transfer of power, the British returned the Gilgit Agency to the Maharaja, who appointed a [[Dogra]] governor for the district and a British commander for the local forces.\n\n\nThe predominant political movement in the Kashmir Valley, the [[Jammu & Kashmir National Conference|National Conference]] led by [[Sheikh Abdullah]], believed in secular politics. It was allied with the [[Indian National Congress]] and was believed to favour joining India. On the other hand, the Muslims of the Jammu province supported the [[All Jammu and Kashmir Muslim Conference|Muslim Conference]], which was allied to the [[All-India Muslim League]] and favoured joining Pakistan. The Hindus of the Jammu province favoured an outright merger with India.<ref>{{citation |first=Balraj |last=Puri |authorlink=Balraj Puri |title=The Question of Accession |journal=Epilogue |volume=4 |number=11 |pp=4\u20136 |date=November 2010 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TMxJzb7N_8wC&pg=PA4 |ref={{sfnref|Puri, The Question of Accession|2010}}}}</ref> In the midst of all the diverging views, the Maharaja's decision to remain independent was apparently a judicious one.{{sfn|Ankit, Henry Scott|2010}}\n{{clear left}}\n===Operation Gulmarg plan===\n{{Location map+\n|Pakistan\n|float      = right\n|width      = 250\n|caption    = Operation Gulmarg locations\n|nodiv      = 1\n|mini       = 1\n|places     =\n{{location map~ |Pakistan |lat=34.36|N |long=73.47|E |label=Muzaffarabad |position=right |link=Muzaffarabad |mark=Blue pog.svg |marksize=4 |label_size=70}}\n{{location map~ |Pakistan |lat=33.76|N |long=74.09|E |label=Poonch |position=right |link=Poonch (town) |mark=Blue pog.svg |marksize=4 |label_size=70}}\n{{location map~ |Pakistan |lat=32.98|N |long=74.07|E |label=Bhimber |position=right |link=Bhimber |mark=Blue pog.svg |marksize=4 |label_size=70}}\n{{location map~ |Pakistan |lat=34.18|N |long=73.24|E |label=Abbottabad |position=left |link=Abbottabad |mark=Red pog.svg |marksize=4 |label_size=0}}\n{{location map~ |Pakistan |lat=34.75|N |long=72.35|E |label=Swat |position=left |link=Swat (princely state) |mark=Green pog.svg |marksize=4 |label_size=0}}\n{{location map~ |Pakistan |lat=35.20|N |long=71.88|E |label=Dir |position=left |link=Dir (princely state) |mark=Green pog.svg |marksize=4 |label_size=0}}\n{{location map~ |Pakistan |lat=35.85|N |long=71.79|E |label=Chitral |position=left |link=Chitral (princely state) |mark=Green pog.svg |marksize=4 |label_size=0}}\n{{location map~ |Pakistan |lat=32.94|N |long=70.61|E |label=Bannu |position=right |link=Bannu |mark=Red pog.svg |marksize=4 |label_size=0}}\n{{location map~ |Pakistan |lat=32.29|N |long=69.57|E |label=Wanna |position=right |link=Wanna, Pakistan |mark=Red pog.svg |marksize=4 |label_size=0}}\n{{location map~ |Pakistan |lat=33.58|N |long=71.42|E |label=Kohat |position=right |link=Kohat |Red=Red pog.svg |marksize=4 |label_size=0}}\n{{location map~ |Pakistan |lat=33.37|N |long=70.55|E |label=Thall |position=right |link=Thall |mark=Red pog.svg |marksize=4 |label_size=0}}\n{{location map~ |Pakistan |lat=34.01|N |long=71.98|E |label=Nowshera |position=right |link=Nowshera, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa |mark=Red pog.svg |marksize=4 |label_size=0}}\n{{location map~ |Pakistan |lat=35.507284|N |long=73.35631334|E |label=Indus river |position=right |link=Indus River |mark=Blue pog.svg |marksize=4 |label_size=70}}\n{{location map~ |Pakistan |lat=31.712541|N |long=74.456148|E |label=Ravi river |position=river |link=Ravi River |mark=Blue pog.svg |marksize=4 |label_size=70}}\n}}\n\nAccording to Indian military sources, the Pakistani Army prepared a plan called '''Operation Gulmarg''' and put it into action as early as 20 August, a few days after Pakistan's independence.

Poonch was originally an internal ''jagir'' (autonomous principality), governed by an alternative family line of Maharaja Hari Singh. The taxation is said to have been heavy. The Muslims of Poonch had long campaigned for the principality to be absorbed into the Punjab province of British India. In 1938, a notable disturbance occurred for religious reasons, but a settlement was reached.{{sfn|Ankit, The Problem of Poonch|2010|p=8}} During the Second World War, over 60,000 men from Poonch and Mirpur districts enrolled in the British Indian Army.

As Joseph Korbel noted, the Indian government had already promised arms and weapons to counter the spreading rebellion in Poonch; although; these had not arrived, there was no demand then for accession to be a condition upon receiving assistance. Despite Mountbatten's fear of a full-scale war, involving British officers on opposing sides, how could he have reasoned that it was necessary for Jammu and Kashmir \u2013 technically an independent country \u2013 to accede first before receiving military assistance? Why was no appeal made to the United Nations for assistance at that time? And why did no one suggest getting in touch with the Pakistani government in Karachi for consultation?

Does this vindicate the Indian Government's claim that the Maharaja's subsequent accession to India had majority support? It might, if we knew precisely what the two parties wanted, and if we could be sure that they spoke, collectively, for the Kashmiri people. But the precisely what the two parties wanted, and if we could be sure that they spoke, collectively, for the Kashmiri people. But the intentions of the party leaders in 1947 are obscure and their representativeness questionable. To take the second point first, support for Pakistan in Kashmir was by no means co-extensive with support for the MC. On the one hand some Kashmiris appear to have adopted Abbas party' mainly out of respect for Jinnah and as a vehicle through which to 'express their sentiment about Pakistan and the Muslim League'. As Ghulam Muhammad noted in a letter to Jinnah: 'The people of Srinagar are League-struck even...though they neither had nor have any faith in Mirwaiz'. On the other hand, many NC followers seem to have divided up their allegiance, acknowledging Abdullah as their leader 'up to Kohala' \u2013 that is, locally- and Jinnah beyond. Saraf remembers that it 'was a common sight in the 1940s to find the photographs of Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah and those of Allama Iqbal and Quaid-e-Azam hanging side by side in the houses or business premises of supporters of the National Conference; while League member Samseenuddin Khan, who visited Kashmir in 1945, found that the 'jewellers and ordinary folk' he spoke to regarded themselves as 'under the banner of the Muslim League' and staunch disciples of 'the Congress leader Sheikh Abdullah'.|access-date=26 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180726214858/https://books.google.com/books?id=VaeuCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA219|archive-date=26 July 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Stages of the war==\n[[File:J&K01low.jpg|right|thumb|300px|State defence of the Kashmir Valley 22 October 1947&nbsp;\u2013 26 October 1947]]\n===Initial invasion===\n\nThe first clash occurred at [[Thorar]] on 3\u20134 October 1947.<ref name=\"reg history\"/>\nOn 22 October another attack was launched in the Muzaffarabad sector.

The largely rural hamlet is located north of [[Horsham#Holbrook|Holbrook]] beyond the A264. It is bordered by Langhurstwood Road to the west, [[Old Holbrook]] to the east, and Green Lane on its northern perimeter.\n\n==History==\nThe name Graylands originates from Graylands Farm, an estate which was acquired in 1647 for the use of John Rowland of Horsham, consisting of \"barns, buildings and land\".<ref>http://www.westsussexpast.org.uk/SearchOnline/Record.aspx?src=CalmView.Catalog&id=SAS-B%2f6%2f227&pos=6</ref> The estate was later administrated by diamond pioneer [[Henry Boyd Wallis]] until his death in 1908.<ref>Suss. in 20th Cent. 61, 454.</ref> A medieval moat exists immediately north of Graylands Farm, named ''Graylands Moat''. Ornamental trees cover the interior of the moat, whilst the ditches of the moat are waterlogged.<ref>{{NHLE|num=1010500 |desc=Moated site 200m west of Graylands Copse |date=1992-06-03 |accessdate=2016-05-24}}</ref>\n\nHolbrook House falls within the eastern perimeter of the hamlet, build in an Italian [[Neoclassical architecture]] style.  [[Robert Henry Hurst (senior)]], Member of Parliament for Horsham between 1832\u20131841 and 1844\u20131857, lived in the property. Apartments and residential housing now exist in this estate.<ref>W.S.R.O., SP 693</ref>\n\nThe construction of the [[A264]] North Horsham bypass in 1989 re-defined the boundaries of Graylands. The hamlet was no longer directly connected to [[Horsham]] proper due to the [[A roads in Great Britain|A road]], insulating Graylands from any urban development. The rural nature of Graylands is currently at stake due to the planned land development in the area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://landnorthofhorsham.co.uk/ |title=North of Horsham &#124; Planning for the future \u2022 delivering local priorities |publisher=Landnorthofhorsham.co.uk |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate=2016-05-24}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Graylands Hamlet.jpg|thumb|left|A map of Graylands, circa 1937.]]\n[[File:Northlands Gill, Graylands, Horsham.jpg|thumb|right|Northlands Gill is a stream stretching the width of Graylands.]]\n\n== Topography ==\nGraylands contains extensive patches of woodland typical of rural hamlets in [[West Sussex]], namely;\n*'''Grayland Copse'''\n*'''Graylands Plantation'''; West Sussex Footpath 1421 runs through this woodland\n*'''The Knob'''; North of Graylands Plantation, West Sussex Footpath 1421 runs through this woodland \n*'''Morris's Wood'''; Adjacent to The Knob, West Sussex Footpath 1573 runs through this woodland \n*'''Holbrook Plantation'''\n*'''Brookhurst Wood'''; Adjacent to the Langhurstwood Quarry/Clay Pit\n*'''Brookhurst Plantation'''; Inaccessible woodland encased within the Langhurstwood Quarry/Clay Pit.\n* '''Well Copse'''; West Sussex Footpath 1421 runs through this small thicket.\n*'''Northlands Copse'''; Northernmost woodland within the Graylands hamlet.\n*'''Barn Coppice'''; Coppice woodland with an irregular interior containing a water-filled pit in the centre.\n\n\nThere are also a number of narrow streams within Graylands;\n\n*'''Northlands Gill'''; a narrow stream stretching the entire width of Graylands.\n*'''Great Brookhurst Gill'''; a narrow stream in northern Graylands, leading to an unnamed pond in The Knob.\n*'''Holbrook Gill'''; a narrow stream in the south east of Graylands, draining into the Holbrook House estate.\n\n== Industry ==\nGraylands is a largely an agricultural area in the central and southern areas, containing [[rapeseed]] fields.

It is bordered by Langhurstwood Road to the west, [[Old Holbrook]] to the east, and Green Lane on its northern perimeter.\n\n==History==\nThe name Graylands originates from Graylands Farm, an estate which was acquired in 1647 for the use of John Rowland of Horsham, consisting of \"barns, buildings and land\".<ref>http://www.westsussexpast.org.uk/SearchOnline/Record.aspx?src=CalmView.Catalog&id=SAS-B%2f6%2f227&pos=6</ref> The estate was later administrated by diamond pioneer [[Henry Boyd Wallis]] until his death in 1908.<ref>Suss. in 20th Cent. 61, 454.</ref> A medieval moat exists immediately north of Graylands Farm, named ''Graylands Moat''. Ornamental trees cover the interior of the moat, whilst the ditches of the moat are waterlogged.<ref>{{NHLE|num=1010500 |desc=Moated site 200m west of Graylands Copse |date=1992-06-03 |accessdate=2016-05-24}}</ref>\n\nHolbrook House falls within the eastern perimeter of the hamlet, build in an Italian [[Neoclassical architecture]] style.  [[Robert Henry Hurst (senior)]], Member of Parliament for Horsham between 1832\u20131841 and 1844\u20131857, lived in the property. Apartments and residential housing now exist in this estate.<ref>W.S.R.O., SP 693</ref>\n\nThe construction of the [[A264]] North Horsham bypass in 1989 re-defined the boundaries of Graylands. The hamlet was no longer directly connected to [[Horsham]] proper due to the [[A roads in Great Britain|A road]], insulating Graylands from any urban development. The rural nature of Graylands is currently at stake due to the planned land development in the area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://landnorthofhorsham.co.uk/ |title=North of Horsham &#124; Planning for the future \u2022 delivering local priorities |publisher=Landnorthofhorsham.co.uk |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate=2016-05-24}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Graylands Hamlet.jpg|thumb|left|A map of Graylands, circa 1937.]]\n[[File:Northlands Gill, Graylands, Horsham.jpg|thumb|right|Northlands Gill is a stream stretching the width of Graylands.]]\n\n== Topography ==\nGraylands contains extensive patches of woodland typical of rural hamlets in [[West Sussex]], namely;\n*'''Grayland Copse'''\n*'''Graylands Plantation'''; West Sussex Footpath 1421 runs through this woodland\n*'''The Knob'''; North of Graylands Plantation, West Sussex Footpath 1421 runs through this woodland \n*'''Morris's Wood'''; Adjacent to The Knob, West Sussex Footpath 1573 runs through this woodland \n*'''Holbrook Plantation'''\n*'''Brookhurst Wood'''; Adjacent to the Langhurstwood Quarry/Clay Pit\n*'''Brookhurst Plantation'''; Inaccessible woodland encased within the Langhurstwood Quarry/Clay Pit.\n* '''Well Copse'''; West Sussex Footpath 1421 runs through this small thicket.\n*'''Northlands Copse'''; Northernmost woodland within the Graylands hamlet.\n*'''Northlands Copse'''; Northernmost woodland within the Graylands hamlet.\n*'''Barn Coppice'''; Coppice woodland with an irregular interior containing a water-filled pit in the centre.\n\n\nThere are also a number of narrow streams within Graylands;\n\n*'''Northlands Gill'''; a narrow stream stretching the entire width of Graylands.\n*'''Great Brookhurst Gill'''; a narrow stream in northern Graylands, leading to an unnamed pond in The Knob.\n*'''Holbrook Gill'''; a narrow stream in the south east of Graylands, draining into the Holbrook House estate.\n\n== Industry ==\nGraylands is a largely an agricultural area in the central and southern areas, containing [[rapeseed]] fields. The northern areas of Graylands are more forested and less agrarian, with a clay pit named Langhurstwood Quarry existing in the north west of the hamlet, dating back to 1888.

Atwood, an early settler of what would later become Hughes County, Oklahoma. Atwood was an educated farmer, extensive area landowner, and elected commissioner of Hughes County. He was born in July 1862 in central [[Texas]], to natives of [[Tennessee]] who had migrated to Texas before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. In 1881, Atwood left Texas for the Mushulatubbee District of the [[Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma]]. Settling in western Tobucksy County, some {{convert|28|mi}} west of a pioneer general store owned by J.J. McAlester, Atwood married a young woman named Patsy Ann, of the Choctaw Nation, giving him settlement rights by marriage. By 1885, he was farming {{convert|25|acre|m2}} of what later would become eastern Hughes County, and was enumerated in the Choctaw Nation census of that year.<ref name=\"EOHC-Atwood\">[https://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=AT006 Fran Cook and Spencer P.

Two other children born after 1900 died before reaching adulthood.\n\nAt statehood, counties created under the Choctaw Nation were redrawn and renamed. That portion of Tobucksy County in which Newburg lay, fell inside the new boundary of [[Hughes County, Oklahoma]]. On December 3, 1909, two years after Oklahoma statehood, the town of Newburg was renamed \"Atwood\", honoring Chester C. Atwood as one of the significant pioneer members of the community.<ref name=\"EOHC-Atwood\"/>\n\nAtwood served as an elected commissioner of Hughes County, and son Coleman Atwood worked as a local banker before moving to [[Holdenville, Oklahoma|Holdenville]] during the Depression. Chester C. Atwood died after 1930.\n\nThe Missouri, Oklahoma and Gulf Railway {{efn|The railroad was renamed the [[Kansas, Oklahoma and Gulf Railway]] after 1919.<ref name=\"EOHC-Atwood\"/>}} built a line from Muskogee to the Red River, bypassing Newburg. Therefore, some of Newburg's residents moved one mile south to take advantage of the rail system.
