The enactment of the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] by United States President [[Abraham Lincoln]] on January 1, 1863 had opened the way for the enlistment of free men of color and newly liberated slaves to fight for their freedom within the [[Union Army]]. As the ranks of the 54th Massachusetts quickly reached its full complement of recruits, an overflow of colored volunteers continued to pour in from several other states outside Massachusetts-many of whom simply had not arrived in time-prompting Governor [[John A. Andrew|John Albion Andrew]] to authorize yet another regiment of colored soldiers sponsored by the Commonwealth. Thus, the 55th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry came into being.\n\nAlthough Union forces had achieved a victory at the [[Battle of Antietam]] in September 1862, two years of war had taken a great toll in men and resources. Yet, in spite of this, free men of color remained largely excluded from taking up arms as soldiers in the defense of the Union and their own continued liberty. In his Pulitzer Prize winning book [[Battle Cry of Freedom]] noted historian [[James M. McPherson]] wrote: \u201cDespite the service of black soldiers in the [[American Revolution|[American] Revolution]] and the [[War of 1812]], Negroes had been barred from state militias since 1792 and the regular army had never enrolled black soldiers. The prejudices of the old order died hard.\" In a speech delivered on March 21, 1863, the great abolitionist orator [[Frederick Douglass]] recounted how he had \u201c...implored the imperiled nation to unchain against her foes, her powerful black hand.\u201d Under the leadership of Governor Andrew, the [[Commonwealth of Massachusetts]] took decisive action to do just that. Both the 54th and the 55th regiments were mustered in at [[Camp Meigs]] in [[Readville, Massachusetts]], near [[Boston]], and were trained there in that camp. The two regiments ultimately brigaded together, fighting and dying side by side during the campaign at Honey Hill, South Carolina, on November 30, 1864. It was from the 54th Massachusetts that officers Norwood Penrose Hallowell and Alfred Stedman Hartwell were promoted and mustered in as Colonel and Lieutenant Colonel, respectively, to lead the newly formed regiment, with Charles Barnard Fox of the [[2nd Massachusetts Cavalry]] mustered in as Major. Together with the 2nd and 3rd North Carolina Colored Volunteers (which later became renumbered as the 36th and 37th U.S. Colored Troops respectively), it was a part of \"Wild's African Brigade\" led by [[Edward A. Wild]] for much of the war.\n\nFollowing departure from Boston for [[North Carolina]] and before seeing action in battle, Colonel Hallowell took a furlough to the north in order to seek treatment of a severe wound he had suffered at Antietam, and ultimately resigned his commission never to return to active duty.  In turn, officers Hartwell and Fox were promoted to lead the regiment as Colonel and Lt. Colonel, respectively, with Sigourney Wales mustered in as Major. Coincidentally, the newly formed regiment received its regimental colors from Governor Andrew on July 18, 1863, the very day that the Massachusetts 54th launched its fateful assault on Fort Morgan at Morris Island, South Carolina.\n\nDue to the Commonwealth's relatively small black population, both the 54th Massachusetts and, subsequently, the Mass-55th, were made up of free men of color recruited from other states, including Ohio, New York, and Pennsylvania. The [[State of Ohio]] provided 222 recruits to the 55th Massachusetts, more than any other northern state. Among these was [[James Monroe Trotter]] of [[Chillicothe, Ohio]], father of [[William Monroe Trotter]], an early civil rights activist and a co-founder of the [[Niagara Movement]], the direct predecessor to the [[NAACP]]. William Monroe Trotter was also a graduate of Harvard University and numbered among the [[100 Greatest African Americans]] as compiled by [[Molefi Kete Asante]], Ph.D.\n\nAt the time of formation, the colored troops of Massachusetts were promised a pay rate of $13.00 per month, equal to that of all other active recruits throughout the Union Army.  This promise was not initially honored, principally due to inaction of the U.S. Congress. On principle, these men almost unanimously chose to forgo their pay altogether until this discrepancy was fully rectified. And according to the Civil War Index: \"Like the 54th, a grave injustice was done the men of the 55th in the matter of pay, as the Federal paymasters offered the men but $10 a month. This, they consistently refused to accept, and serious trouble with the men was narrowly averted in consequence.\" By one account, James Monroe Trotter \u201cwas the first soldier to step forth and say to the paymaster \u2018No, sir; we\u2019ll never take it. We are soldiers, we will accept nothing less than the soldier\u2019s pay. We are perfectly willing to take the soldier\u2019s fare, but we will not degrade the name of an American soldier.\u2019\u201d This circumstance persisted for a period of eighteen months before the matter was finally settled through action taken by the War Department.\n\nIn her 1995 article 'History of 55th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry', Civil War historian Katherine Dhalle stated the following:\n\"The war that had taken so many lives had also seen fit to form many survivors into the leaders of a new, reunited country. Despite frustrations, disappointments, obstacles, and restrictions, the men of the 55th bore their military office well. Instead of retreating in the face of adversity, whether it be the enemy, their fellow officers, or their own government, they continued in their quest to promote freedom and preserve the Union at all costs. For this they deserve our unending respect and admiration. As well, the brave men of the regiment, both black and white, who fought side by side, and lived through the inequities of a discriminatory government, deserve to be remembered as the heroes they are. Nothing less would be acceptable.\"\n\n==Notable soldiers and Officers==\n\n{{Multiple image\n| direction=horizontal\n| width=\n| footer=\n| width1=180\n| image1=2nd_Lt._James_Monroe_Trotter.png \n| caption1=2nd.

Trotter traced his family ancestry back to [[Monticello]], the [[Virginia]] plantation home of President [[Thomas Jefferson]]. Sergeants John Freeman Shorter and William Dupree, both men of color, were also mustered into the regiment as 2nd Lieutenants. However, despite these notable achievements, Lt. J.M. Trotter wrote: \u201cThere is much feeling in the Regiment among the officers against these promotions of colored men in Regiments with white officers; but all the best officers are in favor of it...Some talk of resigning on account of these promotions. I cannot say that they will do so...I do not know how it will all turn out, but Dupree and I will try to do our duty as officers let prejudice be as great as it may.\u201d Echoing these sentiments, Lt. John F. Shorter in reading the regiment's resolutions, called upon his fellow brave soldiers of color to fulfill their first duty as men, to \"prove our fitness for liberty and citizenship, in the new order of things now arising in this, our native land.\"\n*Joshua Dunbar, a former slave and father of renowned American poet [[Paul Lawrence Dunbar]], served in both the 55th Massachusetts regiment and the [[5th Regiment Massachusetts Colored Volunteer Cavalry|5th Regiment, Massachusetts Cavalry (Colored)]].

The enactment of the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] by United States President [[Abraham Lincoln]] on January 1, 1863 had opened the way for the enlistment of free men of color and newly liberated slaves to fight for their freedom within the [[Union Army]]. As the ranks of the 54th Massachusetts quickly reached its full complement of recruits, an overflow of colored volunteers continued to pour in from several other states outside Massachusetts-many of whom simply had not arrived in time-prompting Governor [[John A. Andrew|John Albion Andrew]] to authorize yet another regiment of colored soldiers sponsored by the Commonwealth. Thus, the 55th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry came into being.\n\nAlthough Union forces had achieved a victory at the [[Battle of Antietam]] in September 1862, two years of war had taken a great toll in men and resources. Yet, in spite of this, free men of color remained largely excluded from taking up arms as soldiers in the defense of the Union and their own continued liberty. In his Pulitzer Prize winning book [[Battle Cry of Freedom]] noted historian [[James M. McPherson]] wrote: \u201cDespite the service of black soldiers in the [[American Revolution|[American] Revolution]] and the [[War of 1812]], Negroes had been barred from state militias since 1792 and the regular army had never enrolled black soldiers. The prejudices of the old order died hard.\" In a speech delivered on March 21, 1863, the great abolitionist orator [[Frederick Douglass]] recounted how he had \u201c...implored the imperiled nation to unchain against her foes, her powerful black hand.\u201d Under the leadership of Governor Andrew, the [[Commonwealth of Massachusetts]] took decisive action to do just that. Both the 54th and the 55th regiments were mustered in at [[Camp Meigs]] in [[Readville, Massachusetts]], near [[Boston]], and were trained there in that camp. The two regiments ultimately brigaded together, fighting and dying side by side during the campaign at Honey Hill, South Carolina, on November 30, 1864. It was from the 54th Massachusetts that officers Norwood Penrose Hallowell and Alfred Stedman Hartwell were promoted and mustered in as Colonel and Lieutenant Colonel, respectively, to lead the newly formed regiment, with Charles Barnard Fox of the [[2nd Massachusetts Cavalry]] mustered in as Major. Together with the 2nd and 3rd North Carolina Colored Volunteers (which later became renumbered as the 36th and 37th U.S. Colored Troops respectively), it was a part of \"Wild's African Brigade\" led by [[Edward A. Wild]] for much of the war.\n\nFollowing departure from Boston for [[North Carolina]] and before seeing action in battle, Colonel Hallowell took a furlough to the north in order to seek treatment of a severe wound he had suffered at Antietam, and ultimately resigned his commission never to return to active duty.  In turn, officers Hartwell and Fox were promoted to lead the regiment as Colonel and Lt. Colonel, respectively, with Sigourney Wales mustered in as Major. Coincidentally, the newly formed regiment received its regimental colors from Governor Andrew on July 18, 1863, the very day that the Massachusetts 54th launched its fateful assault on Fort Morgan at Morris Island, South Carolina.\n\nDue to the Commonwealth's relatively small black population, both the 54th Massachusetts and, subsequently, the Mass-55th, were made up of free men of color recruited from other states, including Ohio, New York, and Pennsylvania. The [[State of Ohio]] provided 222 recruits to the 55th Massachusetts, more than any other northern state. Among these was [[James Monroe Trotter]] of [[Chillicothe, Ohio]], father of [[William Monroe Trotter]], an early civil rights activist and a co-founder of the [[Niagara Movement]], the direct predecessor to the [[NAACP]]. William Monroe Trotter was also a graduate of Harvard University and numbered among the [[100 Greatest African Americans]] as compiled by [[Molefi Kete Asante]], Ph.D.\n\nAt the time of formation, the colored troops of Massachusetts were promised a pay rate of $13.00 per month, equal to that of all other active recruits throughout the Union Army.  This promise was not initially honored, principally due to inaction of the U.S. Congress. On principle, these men almost unanimously chose to forgo their pay altogether until this discrepancy was fully rectified. And according to the Civil War Index: \"Like the 54th, a grave injustice was done the men of the 55th in the matter of pay, as the Federal paymasters offered the men but $10 a month. This, they consistently refused to accept, and serious trouble with the men was narrowly averted in consequence.\" By one account, James Monroe Trotter \u201cwas the first soldier to step forth and say to the paymaster \u2018No, sir; we\u2019ll never take it. We are soldiers, we will accept nothing less than the soldier\u2019s pay. We are perfectly willing to take the soldier\u2019s fare, but we will not degrade the name of an American soldier.\u2019\u201d This circumstance persisted for a period of eighteen months before the matter was finally settled through action taken by the War Department.\n\nIn her 1995 article 'History of 55th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry', Civil War historian Katherine Dhalle stated the following:\n\"The war that had taken so many lives had also seen fit to form many survivors into the leaders of a new, reunited country. Despite frustrations, disappointments, obstacles, and restrictions, the men of the 55th bore their military office well. Instead of retreating in the face of adversity, whether it be the enemy, their fellow officers, or their own government, they continued in their quest to promote freedom and preserve the Union at all costs. For this they deserve our unending respect and admiration. As well, the brave men of the regiment, both black and white, who fought side by side, and lived through the inequities of a discriminatory government, deserve to be remembered as the heroes they are. Nothing less would be acceptable.\"\n\n==Notable soldiers and Officers==\n\n{{Multiple image\n| direction=horizontal\n| width=\n| footer=\n| width1=180\n| image1=2nd_Lt._James_Monroe_Trotter.png \n| caption1=2nd.

Some of the free software mentioned here does not have detailed maps (or maps at all) or the ability to follow streets or type in street names (no [[geocoding]]). However, in many cases, it is also that which makes the program free (and sometimes open source<ref>Having open-source GPS programs available for different devices also allows people to expand on this software for certain projects, like automated or semi-automated steering systems for vehicles</ref>), avoid the need of an Internet connection,<ref>Programs like Google maps require an internet connection as the maps are not available offline, in part because this would also make the program very large in filesize</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/591/how-to-use-gps-maps-without-an-internet-connection |title=offline - How to use GPS/Maps without an Internet connection? - Android Enthusiasts Stack Exchange |website=Android.stackexchange.com |date= |accessdate=2017-05-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Joe Levi |url=http://pocketnow.com/2013/07/22/google-maps-offline |title=Here's how to take your Google Maps offline after the v7 update |website=Pocketnow.com |date=2013-07-22 |accessdate=2017-05-03}}</ref> and make it very lightweight (allowing use on small portable devices, including smartphones). Very basic programs like this may not be suitable for road navigation in cars, but serve their purpose for navigation while walking or trekking, and for use at sea. To determine the GPS coordinates of a destination, one can use sites such as [https://www.gpscoordinates.eu/ GPScoordinates.eu] and [http://www.gpsvisualizer.com GPS visualizer].\n\nSome software presented here is free, but maps may need to be paid for. In this instance, and in the instance that some maps (of specific countries) are not standardly available, Mobile Atlas Creator (MOBAC) can be used (e.g. on OruxMaps, Maverick, Sports Tracker, Maplorer).\n\nSome of the software mentioned can also be run on different devices than what they are intended for. A particular case-in-point is the Android software which can often [[Android (operating system)#Platform usage|be run on laptops or PCs]] (running [[Linux]], [[Windows]] or [[Mac OS X]]) as well. This can be done using emulators.\n\nSome of the software mentioned here may run only on devices that are no longer commercially sold (such as the PalmPilot and PocketPC devices).

Some of the free software mentioned here does not have detailed maps (or maps at all) or the ability to follow streets or type in street names (no [[geocoding]]). However, in many cases, it is also that which makes the program free (and sometimes open source<ref>Having open-source GPS programs available for different devices also allows people to expand on this software for certain projects, like automated or semi-automated steering systems for vehicles</ref>), avoid the need of an Internet connection,<ref>Programs like Google maps require an internet connection as the maps are not available offline, in part because this would also make the program very large in filesize</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/591/how-to-use-gps-maps-without-an-internet-connection |title=offline - How to use GPS/Maps without an Internet connection? - Android Enthusiasts Stack Exchange |website=Android.stackexchange.com |date= |accessdate=2017-05-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Joe Levi |url=http://pocketnow.com/2013/07/22/google-maps-offline |title=Here's how to take your Google Maps offline after the v7 update |website=Pocketnow.com |date=2013-07-22 |accessdate=2017-05-03}}</ref> and make it very lightweight (allowing use on small portable devices, including smartphones). Very basic programs like this may not be suitable for road navigation in cars, but serve their purpose for navigation while walking or trekking, and for use at sea. To determine the GPS coordinates of a destination, one can use sites such as [https://www.gpscoordinates.eu/ GPScoordinates.eu] and [http://www.gpsvisualizer.com GPS visualizer].\n\nSome software presented here is free, but maps may need to be paid for. In this instance, and in the instance that some maps (of specific countries) are not standardly available, Mobile Atlas Creator (MOBAC) can be used (e.g. on OruxMaps, Maverick, Sports Tracker, Maplorer).\n\nSome of the software mentioned can also be run on different devices than what they are intended for. A particular case-in-point is the Android software which can often [[Android (operating system)#Platform usage|be run on laptops or PCs]] (running [[Linux]], [[Windows]] or [[Mac OS X]]) as well.

Located at the center of Cheshire County, Keene was designated as the county seat in 1769. Land was set off for the towns of [[Sullivan, New Hampshire|Sullivan]] and [[Roxbury, New Hampshire|Roxbury]], although Keene would annex {{convert|154|acre|km2}} from [[Swanzey, New Hampshire|Swanzey]] (formerly Lower Ashuelot).\n\n[[File:PostcardKeeneNHBoston&MaineRRYards1916.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Boston and Maine railroad yard in Keene, circa 1916]]\n[[Timothy Dwight IV|Timothy Dwight]], the [[Yale College|Yale]] president who chronicled his travels, described the town as \"...one of the prettiest in [[New England]].\"{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} Situated on an ancient lake bed surrounded by hills, the valley with fertile meadows was excellent for farming. The [[Ashuelot River]] was later used to provided [[hydropower|water power]] for [[sawmill]]s, [[gristmill]]s and [[Tanning (leather)|tanneries]]. After the railroad was constructed to the town in 1848, numerous other industries were established. Keene became a manufacturing center for wooden-ware, [[Bucket|pail]]s, chairs, [[sash window|sashes]], [[window shutter|shutters]], doors, [[pottery]], glass, soap, [[woolen]] textiles, shoes, [[saddle]]s, mowing machines, [[carriage]]s and [[sleigh]]s. It also had a brickyard and [[foundry]]. Keene was incorporated as a city in 1874, and by 1880 had a population of 6,784. In the early 1900s, the [[Newburyport Silver Company]] moved to Keene to take advantage of its skilled workers and location.\n\nNew England manufacturing declined in the 20th century, however, particularly during the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]]. Keene is today a center for [[insurance]], education, and tourism. The city retains a considerable inventory of fine [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] architecture from its [[mill town]] era. An example is the Keene Public Library, which occupies a [[Second Empire architecture|Second Empire]] mansion built about 1869 by manufacturer Henry Colony.\n\nKeene's manufacturing success was brought on in part by its importance as a railroad city. The Cheshire Railroad, Manchester & Keene Railroad, and the [[Ashuelot Railroad]] all met here. By the early 1900s all had been absorbed by the [[Boston and Maine Corporation|Boston & Maine Railroad]]. Keene was home to a railroad shop complex and two railroad yards. The Manchester & Keene Branch was abandoned following the floods of 1936. Beginning in 1945, Keene was a stopping point for the Boston & Maine's streamlined trainset known at that time as the ''[[Flying Yankee|Cheshire]]''.\n\nKeene became notable in 1962 when F. Nelson Blount chose the city for the site of his [[Steamtown, U.S.A.]] attraction. But Blount's plan fell through and, after one operating season in Keene, the museum was relocated to nearby [[Bellows Falls, Vermont]]. The Boston & Maine abandoned the Cheshire Branch in 1972, leaving the Ashuelot Branch as Keene's only rail connection to the outside world.\n\nIn 1978 the B&M leased switching operations in Keene to the [[Green Mountain Railroad]], which took over the entire Ashuelot Branch in 1982. Passenger decline and track conditions forced the Green Mountain to end service on the Ashuelot Branch in 1983 and return operating rights to the B&M. However, there were no longer enough customers to warrant service on the line. In 1984 the last train arrived in and departed Keene, consisting of Boston & Maine [[EMD GP9]] 1714, pulling flat cars to carry rails removed from the railyard. Track conditions on the Ashuelot Branch were so poor at the time that the engine returned light (without cars) to [[Brattleboro, Vermont|Brattleboro]].

The average high temperature in July is {{convert|82|F}}, and the record high for Keene is {{convert|102|F}}. As with other cities in the eastern U.S., periods of high humidity can raise heat indices to near {{convert|110|F}}. During the summer, Keene can get hit by [[thunderstorm]]s from the west, but the [[Green Mountains]] to the west often break up some of the storms, so that Keene doesn't usually experience a thunderstorm at full strength. The last time a [[tornado]] hit Cheshire County was in 1997.\n\nThe winters in Keene can be very harsh. The most recent such winter was 2002\u20132003, when Keene received {{convert|112.5|in}} of snow. The majority of the snowfall in Keene comes from [[nor'easter]]s, areas of low pressure that move up the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast and strengthen. Many times these storms can produce [[blizzard]] conditions across southern New England. Recent examples are the blizzard of 2005 and the blizzard of 2006. Keene is situated in an area where cold air meets the moisture from the south, so often Keene gets the jackpot with winter storms. Aside from snow, winters can be very cold. Even in the warmest of winters, Keene usually has at least one night below {{convert|0|F}}. During January 2004, Keene saw highs below freezing 25 of the days, including five days in the single digits and one day with a high of zero. Overnight lows dropped below zero 12 times, including 7 nights below {{convert|\u221210|F}}. The record low in Keene is {{convert|\u221231|F}}. In addition to the cold temperatures, Keene can receive biting winds that drive the [[wind chill]] down below {{convert|\u221230|F}}.\n\nSnow can occur right through the end of April, but on the other end, {{convert|80|F}} days can begin in late March. Autumn weather is similar. Keene's first snowfall usually occurs in early November, though the city can also see {{convert|60|F}} days into mid-November. Significant rain events can occur in the spring and fall. For example, record rainfall and flooding with the axis of heaviest rain (around {{convert|12|in}}) near Keene occurred in October 2005.

Several stages are located throughout the downtown area during the day's events, which are free to the public and sponsored by locally owned businesses. Visitors, mostly from the local community, roam the city's sidewalks listening to the dozens of bands.\n\n===Keene in popular culture===\n* The 1949 movie ''[[Lost Boundaries]]'', starring [[Mel Ferrer]], tells the true story of a [[African American|black]] Keene physician who passed as white for many years. The film won the 1949 [[Cannes Film Festival]] award for best screenplay.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n* Much of the 1995 movie ''[[Jumanji]]'', starring [[Robin Williams]], was filmed in Keene (in November 1994) \u2013 the movie's fictional town of Brantford. Frank's Barber Shop is a featured setting, as well as the Parrish Shoe sign, which was painted for the film. That artwork was subsequently scarred by graffiti, but soon after was professionally restored to its original condition. Later the sign served as a focal point for the sidewalk location of a temporary Robin Williams memorial in the days following the actor's death on August 11, 2014.\n\n===Music and theatre===\nIn 1979, First Lady [[Rosalynn Carter]] dedicated the bandstand in Central Square as the [[Edwin Eugene Bagley|E.

Other theatres and auditoriums include the new [[Keene High School]] Auditorium and the county's largest auditorium,{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} the Larracey Auditorium at [[Keene Middle School]], and The Putnam Arts Lecture Hall on the campus of Keene State.

For example, a common act by some Free Keene activists involves paying money into expired parking meters to help other citizens avoid parking tickets, which has created conflict between the meter pluggers and the parking enforcement officers.

Located at the center of Cheshire County, Keene was designated as the county seat in 1769. Land was set off for the towns of [[Sullivan, New Hampshire|Sullivan]] and [[Roxbury, New Hampshire|Roxbury]], although Keene would annex {{convert|154|acre|km2}} from [[Swanzey, New Hampshire|Swanzey]] (formerly Lower Ashuelot).\n\n[[File:PostcardKeeneNHBoston&MaineRRYards1916.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Boston and Maine railroad yard in Keene, circa 1916]]\n[[Timothy Dwight IV|Timothy Dwight]], the [[Yale College|Yale]] president who chronicled his travels, described the town as \"...one of the prettiest in [[New England]].\"{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} Situated on an ancient lake bed surrounded by hills, the valley with fertile meadows was excellent for farming. The [[Ashuelot River]] was later used to provided [[hydropower|water power]] for [[sawmill]]s, [[gristmill]]s and [[Tanning (leather)|tanneries]]. After the railroad was constructed to the town in 1848, numerous other industries were established. Keene became a manufacturing center for wooden-ware, [[Bucket|pail]]s, chairs, [[sash window|sashes]], [[window shutter|shutters]], doors, [[pottery]], glass, soap, [[woolen]] textiles, shoes, [[saddle]]s, mowing machines, [[carriage]]s and [[sleigh]]s. It also had a brickyard and [[foundry]]. Keene was incorporated as a city in 1874, and by 1880 had a population of 6,784. In the early 1900s, the [[Newburyport Silver Company]] moved to Keene to take advantage of its skilled workers and location.\n\nNew England manufacturing declined in the 20th century, however, particularly during the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]]. Keene is today a center for [[insurance]], education, and tourism. The city retains a considerable inventory of fine [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] architecture from its [[mill town]] era. An example is the Keene Public Library, which occupies a [[Second Empire architecture|Second Empire]] mansion built about 1869 by manufacturer Henry Colony.\n\nKeene's manufacturing success was brought on in part by its importance as a railroad city. The Cheshire Railroad, Manchester & Keene Railroad, and the [[Ashuelot Railroad]] all met here. By the early 1900s all had been absorbed by the [[Boston and Maine Corporation|Boston & Maine Railroad]]. Keene was home to a railroad shop complex and two railroad yards. The Manchester & Keene Branch was abandoned following the floods of 1936. Beginning in 1945, Keene was a stopping point for the Boston & Maine's streamlined trainset known at that time as the ''[[Flying Yankee|Cheshire]]''.\n\nKeene became notable in 1962 when F. Nelson Blount chose the city for the site of his [[Steamtown, U.S.A.]] attraction. But Blount's plan fell through and, after one operating season in Keene, the museum was relocated to nearby [[Bellows Falls, Vermont]]. The Boston & Maine abandoned the Cheshire Branch in 1972, leaving the Ashuelot Branch as Keene's only rail connection to the outside world.\n\nIn 1978 the B&M leased switching operations in Keene to the [[Green Mountain Railroad]], which took over the entire Ashuelot Branch in 1982. Passenger decline and track conditions forced the Green Mountain to end service on the Ashuelot Branch in 1983 and return operating rights to the B&M. However, there were no longer enough customers to warrant service on the line. In 1984 the last train arrived in and departed Keene, consisting of Boston & Maine [[EMD GP9]] 1714, pulling flat cars to carry rails removed from the railyard. Track conditions on the Ashuelot Branch were so poor at the time that the engine returned light (without cars) to [[Brattleboro, Vermont|Brattleboro]]. A [[Road-rail vehicle|hi-rail truck]] was used instead to remove the flatcars.\n\nIn 1995 the freight house, one of the last remaining railroad buildings in town, burned due to [[arson]]. Since the late 20th century, the railroad beds through town were redeveloped as the Cheshire Rail Trail and the Ashuelot Rail Trail.\n\nIn 2011, radical activist [[Thomas Ball (activist)|Thomas Ball]] [[Self-immolation|immolated]] himself on the steps of a courthouse in Keene to protest what he considered the court system's abuse of divorced [[fathers' rights]].<ref name=\"immolation\">{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/new_hampshire/articles/2011/07/10/divorced_dad_leaves_clues_to_his_desperation/?page=1| last=Arsenault| first=Mark| work=Boston Globe| title=Dad leaves clues to his desperation| date=July 10, 2011| access-date=September 16, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nKeene is located at {{Coord|42|56|01|N|72|16|41|W|type:city}} (42.9339, \u221272.2784).<ref>{{Cite GNIS|867823|Keene}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|97.1|sqkm|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|96.5|sqkm|order=flip}} is land and {{convert|0.7|sqkm|order=flip|1}} is water, the latter comprising 0.67% of the town.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/> Keene is drained by the [[Ashuelot River]].

The average high temperature in July is {{convert|82|F}}, and the record high for Keene is {{convert|102|F}}. As with other cities in the eastern U.S., periods of high humidity can raise heat indices to near {{convert|110|F}}. During the summer, Keene can get hit by [[thunderstorm]]s from the west, but the [[Green Mountains]] to the west often break up some of the storms, so that Keene doesn't usually experience a thunderstorm at full strength. The last time a [[tornado]] hit Cheshire County was in 1997.\n\nThe winters in Keene can be very harsh. The most recent such winter was 2002\u20132003, when Keene received {{convert|112.5|in}} of snow. The majority of the snowfall in Keene comes from [[nor'easter]]s, areas of low pressure that move up the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast and strengthen. Many times these storms can produce [[blizzard]] conditions across southern New England. Recent examples are the blizzard of 2005 and the blizzard of 2006. Keene is situated in an area where cold air meets the moisture from the south, so often Keene gets the jackpot with winter storms. Aside from snow, winters can be very cold. Even in the warmest of winters, Keene usually has at least one night below {{convert|0|F}}. During January 2004, Keene saw highs below freezing 25 of the days, including five days in the single digits and one day with a high of zero. Overnight lows dropped below zero 12 times, including 7 nights below {{convert|\u221210|F}}. The record low in Keene is {{convert|\u221231|F}}. In addition to the cold temperatures, Keene can receive biting winds that drive the [[wind chill]] down below {{convert|\u221230|F}}.\n\nSnow can occur right through the end of April, but on the other end, {{convert|80|F}} days can begin in late March. Autumn weather is similar. Keene's first snowfall usually occurs in early November, though the city can also see {{convert|60|F}} days into mid-November. Significant rain events can occur in the spring and fall. For example, record rainfall and flooding with the axis of heaviest rain (around {{convert|12|in}}) near Keene occurred in October 2005.

He played [[college football]] at [[Oklahoma Sooners football|Oklahoma]], where he was recognized as an [[All-American]], and was drafted by the Redskins fourth overall in the first round of the [[2010 NFL Draft]]. Williams is considered to be one of the best tackles in the league, making seven straight [[Pro Bowl]] appearances from 2012\u20132018. In 2019, Williams held out the entire year due to contractual and personal grievances he had with the Redskins regarding a cancerous growth on his head that was later determined by private doctors to be life threatening.\n\n==Early years==\nBorn and raised in [[Longview, Texas]], Williams attended [[Longview High School]], where he played for the Longview Lobos [[high school football]] team and was teammates with [[Malcolm Kelly]], [[Chris Ivory]], and [[Robert Henson (American football)|Robert Henson]]. Williams was a unanimous first-team all-district selection as a senior. Longview entered the 2005 [[University Interscholastic League|UIL]] playoffs on a 10\u20130 season record, but lost 14\u201313 to [[Nick Florence]]'s [[South Garland High School|South Garland]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.kltv.com/story/4110496/south-garland-stuns-defeats-top-ranked-longview-lobos |title=South Garland Stuns, Defeats Top Ranked Longview Lobos |work= |date=November 12, 2005 }}</ref> He was also on the track team as a shot putter.

Playing as a [[true freshman]], Williams became the starter at right tackle just before the Missouri game in late October 2006 after [[Branndon Braxton]] went down with a broken leg, then started the last six games of the season. Williams played 462 snaps, had 75 knockdowns, and was named to ''[[The Sporting News]]''' Freshman All-America second team.\n\nIn his sophomore year, Williams saw action in all 14 games and had six starts at right tackle, sharing time with [[Branndon Braxton]]. As a junior in 2008, he started all 14 games, the first at left tackle and the remaining 13 at right tackle, and registered 131 knockdowns. He was part of a dominant [[2008 Oklahoma Sooners football team|2008 Sooners]] offensive line that included [[Duke Robinson]], [[Phil Loadholt]], and allowed only 11 sacks all season, the third-lowest total of any team in the country.

He played [[college football]] at [[Oklahoma Sooners football|Oklahoma]], where he was recognized as an [[All-American]], and was drafted by the Redskins fourth overall in the first round of the [[2010 NFL Draft]]. Williams is considered to be one of the best tackles in the league, making seven straight [[Pro Bowl]] appearances from 2012\u20132018. In 2019, Williams held out the entire year due to contractual and personal grievances he had with the Redskins regarding a cancerous growth on his head that was later determined by private doctors to be life threatening.\n\n==Early years==\nBorn and raised in [[Longview, Texas]], Williams attended [[Longview High School]], where he played for the Longview Lobos [[high school football]] team and was teammates with [[Malcolm Kelly]], [[Chris Ivory]], and [[Robert Henson (American football)|Robert Henson]]. Williams was a unanimous first-team all-district selection as a senior. Longview entered the 2005 [[University Interscholastic League|UIL]] playoffs on a 10\u20130 season record, but lost 14\u201313 to [[Nick Florence]]'s [[South Garland High School|South Garland]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.kltv.com/story/4110496/south-garland-stuns-defeats-top-ranked-longview-lobos |title=South Garland Stuns, Defeats Top Ranked Longview Lobos |work= |date=November 12, 2005 }}</ref> He was also on the track team as a shot putter.

Playing as a [[true freshman]], Williams became the starter at right tackle just before the Missouri game in late October 2006 after [[Branndon Braxton]] went down with a broken leg, then started the last six games of the season. Williams played 462 snaps, had 75 knockdowns, and was named to ''[[The Sporting News]]''' Freshman All-America second team.\n\nIn his sophomore year, Williams saw action in all 14 games and had six starts at right tackle, sharing time with [[Branndon Braxton]]. As a junior in 2008, he started all 14 games, the first at left tackle and the remaining 13 at right tackle, and registered 131 knockdowns.

Most models use the [[Global Positioning System|Global Positioning System (GPS)]], and are targeted at [[Road running|road runners]] and [[triathlon|triathletes]]. Forerunner series watches are designed to accurately measure distance, speed, heart rate (optional), time, altitude, and pace, all of which can be important to athletes in training.\n\n== Models ==\nThe Forerunner series consists of the 101, 201, 301, 205, 305, 50, 405, 60, 405CX, 310XT, 110, 210, 410, 610, 910XT, 70, 10, 220, 620, 15, 920XT, 225, 25, 230, 235, 630, 735XT, 35, 935, 30, 645, 645 Music, 45, 45S, 245, 245 Music, 945 (listed in chronological order by release date). All models except the 101 include a way to upload training data to a [[personal computer]] and training software.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://reviews.cnet.com/gps/garmin-forerunner-201/1805-3490_7-30558125.html|title=Garmin Forerunner 201 review - CNET|author=Rebecca Viksnins|date=22 June 2004|accessdate=3 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nGarmin registered the name \"Forerunner\" with the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] in August 2001 but released the first watches&nbsp;\u2014 the 101, 201, and 301&nbsp;\u2014 in 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/jumpto?f=doc&state=4804:wwx8ja.40.162|title=Trademark Electronic Search System (TESS) - FORERUNNER|publisher=[[United States Patent and Trademark Office]]|accessdate=3 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, the improved 205 and 305 appeared. These models are smaller than the first generation and feature a more sensitive [[SiRFstarIII]] GPS receiver chip.\n\nIn late 2007, the Forerunner 50 was introduced. As opposed to GPS, this model paired with a foot pod to measure displacement. The Forerunner 50 also came packaged with a [[USB]] stick that allowed training data to be transferred wirelessly to one's pc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gpsreview.net/garmin-forerunner-50/|title=Garmin Forerunner 50|publisher=gpsreview.net|accessdate=3 October 2014}}</ref> This feature has since become a staple of Garmin's more full-featured sport watches.\n\nThe Forerunner 405 was introduced in 2008 and is significantly smaller than its predecessors, only slightly outsizing a typical wristwatch. The 405 also featured improved satellite discovery and connection.\n\nIn 2009, Garmin produced three new models: the Forerunner 60 (an evolution of the Forerunner 50), the Forerunner 405CX (405 chassis), and the Forerunner 310XT (an evolution of the 305 chassis).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2009/05/pr_0526_garmin_fr60/|title=Garmin Forerunner 310XT - New Garmin Is Hands-Down King of Wrist-Mounted Trainers|author=Mat Honan|date=26 May 2009|accessdate=3 October 2014}}</ref> New features included additional battery life and vibration alerts on the 310XT and advanced calorie consumption modeling on all watches.

The releases included the addition of a touch-sensitive bezel on the 410, presumably, although heavily debated, allowing for easier scrolling and selection of functions. It was touted as providing \"unmatched reliability in sweaty, rainy conditions.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.triathlonbusiness.com/2010/industry-news/garmin-adds-to-410-and-210-to-forerunner-family/|title=Garmin adds to 410 and 210 to Forerunner family|author=Gary Roethenbaugh|date=5 October 2010|accessdate=3 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe Forerunner 610 was released in the spring of 2011. It features a touch sensitive screen as well as vibration alerts.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://buy.garmin.com/shop/shop.do?cID=142&pID=84374|title=Forerunner 610 - Garmin|publisher=[[Garmin]]|accessdate=3 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012 the Forerunner 910XT was introduced, which is a development of the 310XT. This version was originally supposed to be released in Q4 of 2011, but the November date had slipped and it was eventually released in Q1 of 2012. New features are the inclusion of the SiRFStar iv chipset, a barometric altimeter, and improved swimming metrics using an accelerometer in the watch. This allowed it to automatically count pool lengths and to recognize swimming styles.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/into-sports/running/forerunner-910xt/prod90671.html|title=Forerunner 910XT - Garmin|publisher=[[Garmin]]|accessdate=3 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nA further addition to the series was the Forerunner 10, a simple watch offering just GPS tracking of activities and run metrics like distance, pace and calories burned.\n\nAt the end of 2013 the Forerunner 220 and 620 were introduced, with color screens, Bluetooth Low energy (BTLE; allowing connections to some smartphones), and, for the 620 only, a touchscreen, Wi-Fi (allowing automatic activity download) and enhanced \"running dynamics\" given by an updated Heart rate monitor. These watches also abandon syncing via the ANT+ protocol in favor of wired (USB) and Wi-Fi (620 only) data transfers. They are also fully waterproof, but do not include any kind of swimming mode.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/into-sports/running/forerunner-220/prod129397.html|title=Forerunner 220 - Garmin|publisher=[[Garmin]]|accessdate=3 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/into-sports/running/forerunner-620/prod122785.html|title=Forerunner 620 - Garmin|publisher=[[Garmin]]|accessdate=3 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, the Forerunner 15 and 920XT were introduced. The 15 is a development of the 10, adding activity tracking, increased battery life, footpod and heart rate monitor capability. The 920XT is the successor of the 910XT, featuring all the capabilities of it (except ANT+ scale and fitness equipment capability) and adding features found in the 620 such as a color screen, Wi-Fi data transfers and running dynamics. Additionally, battery life over the 910XT was improved, daily activity tracking, GLONASS support and a swim drill mode added, and the 920XT is the first Garmin watch extensible with custom apps built using the Garmin Connect IQ software development kit.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/into-sports/running/forerunner-15/prod145621.html|title=Forerunner 15 - Garmin|publisher=[[Garmin]]|accessdate=3 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/into-sports/running/forerunner-920xt/prod137024.html|title=Forerunner 920XT - Garmin|publisher=[[Garmin]]|accessdate=3 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nAnnounced in May 2015, the Forerunner 225 is the first Garmin watch with an integrated optical heart rate monitor.<ref name=\"Garmin\">{{cite web|url=http://garmin.blogs.com/my_weblog/2015/05/forerunner-225-first-garmin-gps-running-watch-with-wrist-based-heart-rate.html#.VVIkN_lViko|title=Introducing the Forerunner\u00ae 225 \u2013 the first Garmin\u00ae GPS running watch with wrist-based heart rate from Mio, developers of industry-leading optical heart rate technology|publisher=[[Garmin]]|accessdate=12 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nAnnounced in May 2016, the Forerunner 735XT is a triathlon-ready Garmin watch with integrated optical heart rate monitor.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://buy.garmin.com/en-GB/GB/sports-recreation/running/forerunner-735xt/prod541225.html#.VVIkN_lViko/|title=Forerunner\u00ae 735XT}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2017, Garmin announced the Forerunner 935, billing it as a watch for running and triathlons with features similar to the Fenix 5.

The watch comes with Garmin Pay, an NFC enabled touchless pay system and the 645 Music is Garmin's first watch with onboard music storage (4 GB).<ref>{{cite web|title=Forerunner 645 Music|url=https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/p/612476|website=Garmin|accessdate=12 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Forerunner 45/45S, released on April 30, 2019, is an entry level running watch. The 45S has a smaller bezel (39mm) than the 45 (42mm) - there are no other differences.  It has a 3rd generation optical heart rate monitor which features stress detection and Body Battery\u2122 energy, along with earlier-generation OHR metrics. Bluetooth connected features include audio prompts, Live Track, and smart notifications. The activity profiles include outdoor running, treadmill, walk, bike, and cadio, with the ability to configure more through Garmin Connect. The Forerunner 45 also has built-in incident detection and assistance, which notifies a predetermined contact if you crash or fall and provides a live track link of your location.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/p/641121|title=Garmin Forerunner\u00ae 45 {{!}} Running Watch|last=Garmin|last2=subsidiaries|first2=Garmin Ltd or its|website=Garmin|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-06}}</ref>\n\nThe Forerunner 245/245 Music, released on April 30, 2019, are mid-range running watches. The 245 has all of the same capabilities as the 245 Music, though the 245 Music allows you to store and play up to 500 song directly on the watch or play music through music streaming services, such as Spotify or Deezer, through wireless bluetooth earphones. The 245 has Garmin Elevate with a 3rd generation optical heart rate monitor which features Pulse Ox, stress detection, Body Battery\u2122 energy, along with earlier-generation OHR metrics.

The 945  allows you to store and play up to 1000 song directly on the watch or play music through music streaming services, such as Spotify or Deezer, through wireless bluetooth earphones. The 945 has all of the capabilities of its 935 predecessor and all of the features of the Forerunner 245. Garmin Pay.  Other new features of the 945 are heat and altitude acclimation, training load balance, mapping with Tendline\u2122 popularity routing, respiration rate, Around me mode, Climbpro\u2122 future elevation plot, cartography support and topographical maps, XERO\u2122 location, and for the golfer, the 945 is preloaded with 41,000 courses.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/p/621922|title=Garmin Forerunner\u00ae 945 {{!}} Premium Running Watch|last=Garmin|last2=subsidiaries|first2=Garmin Ltd or its|website=Garmin|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-06}}</ref>\n\n==GPS functionality==\n\nThe Forerunner can be used to record historical data by completing a work out and then uploading the data to a computer to create a log of previous exercise activities for analysis.\n\nAdditionally, the Forerunner can be used to navigate during a workout. Users can \"mark\" their current location and then edit this entry's name and coordinates, which enables navigation to those new coordinates. The watch uses the hh.mm.mmmm (hours, minutes, and minute decimals) coordinate format. The 310XT can display additional formats; it also has a screen to display current coordinates in real-time.\n\n==Computer interface==\n\nThe user can download a previously-traveled course/route to the Forerunner using Garmin's Communicator software together with the [[ANT+]] technology, and then follow this course/route to \"race\" against this historical course/route. Until recently this download was possible via the tethered USB connection on the older 205 & 305 models. However, the current version of the software has eliminated this option, requiring the user to acquire a newer model with wireless connection in order to use this feature.\n\nThe user can also make new courses or routes, which can be downloaded to the watch and then followed. This is a convenient way to go on a cross-country bike ride while navigating with the Forerunner. Note: navigating with a course is better than navigating with a route, because a Garmin course can store more points than a Garmin route.\n\nAdditionally, a user can create downloadable points of interest (POIs) by creating a custom map with Google Maps.  POIs can be transferred to the 205 or 305 but not to the 405 or 310XT.\n\n==Models==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! Model !! Release date !!

Most models use the [[Global Positioning System|Global Positioning System (GPS)]], and are targeted at [[Road running|road runners]] and [[triathlon|triathletes]]. Forerunner series watches are designed to accurately measure distance, speed, heart rate (optional), time, altitude, and pace, all of which can be important to athletes in training.\n\n== Models ==\nThe Forerunner series consists of the 101, 201, 301, 205, 305, 50, 405, 60, 405CX, 310XT, 110, 210, 410, 610, 910XT, 70, 10, 220, 620, 15, 920XT, 225, 25, 230, 235, 630, 735XT, 35, 935, 30, 645, 645 Music, 45, 45S, 245, 245 Music, 945 (listed in chronological order by release date). All models except the 101 include a way to upload training data to a [[personal computer]] and training software.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://reviews.cnet.com/gps/garmin-forerunner-201/1805-3490_7-30558125.html|title=Garmin Forerunner 201 review - CNET|author=Rebecca Viksnins|date=22 June 2004|accessdate=3 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nGarmin registered the name \"Forerunner\" with the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] in August 2001 but released the first watches&nbsp;\u2014 the 101, 201, and 301&nbsp;\u2014 in 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/jumpto?f=doc&state=4804:wwx8ja.40.162|title=Trademark Electronic Search System (TESS) - FORERUNNER|publisher=[[United States Patent and Trademark Office]]|accessdate=3 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, the improved 205 and 305 appeared. These models are smaller than the first generation and feature a more sensitive [[SiRFstarIII]] GPS receiver chip.\n\nIn late 2007, the Forerunner 50 was introduced. As opposed to GPS, this model paired with a foot pod to measure displacement. The Forerunner 50 also came packaged with a [[USB]] stick that allowed training data to be transferred wirelessly to one's pc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gpsreview.net/garmin-forerunner-50/|title=Garmin Forerunner 50|publisher=gpsreview.net|accessdate=3 October 2014}}</ref> This feature has since become a staple of Garmin's more full-featured sport watches.\n\nThe Forerunner 405 was introduced in 2008 and is significantly smaller than its predecessors, only slightly outsizing a typical wristwatch. The 405 also featured improved satellite discovery and connection.\n\nIn 2009, Garmin produced three new models: the Forerunner 60 (an evolution of the Forerunner 50), the Forerunner 405CX (405 chassis), and the Forerunner 310XT (an evolution of the 305 chassis).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2009/05/pr_0526_garmin_fr60/|title=Garmin Forerunner 310XT - New Garmin Is Hands-Down King of Wrist-Mounted Trainers|author=Mat Honan|date=26 May 2009|accessdate=3 October 2014}}</ref> New features included additional battery life and vibration alerts on the 310XT and advanced calorie consumption modeling on all watches.

In 2010 a firmware update added vastly improved open-water swimming metrics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dcrainmaker.com/2010/06/new-garmin-forerunner-310xt-openwater.html|title=The New Garmin Forerunner 310XT Openwater Swim Mode\u2026In Depth.|work=DC Rainmaker|accessdate=3 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, the Forerunner 110, 210 and 410 were introduced. The releases included the addition of a touch-sensitive bezel on the 410, presumably, although heavily debated, allowing for easier scrolling and selection of functions. It was touted as providing \"unmatched reliability in sweaty, rainy conditions.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.triathlonbusiness.com/2010/industry-news/garmin-adds-to-410-and-210-to-forerunner-family/|title=Garmin adds to 410 and 210 to Forerunner family|author=Gary Roethenbaugh|date=5 October 2010|accessdate=3 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe Forerunner 610 was released in the spring of 2011. It features a touch sensitive screen as well as vibration alerts.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://buy.garmin.com/shop/shop.do?cID=142&pID=84374|title=Forerunner 610 - Garmin|publisher=[[Garmin]]|accessdate=3 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012 the Forerunner 910XT was introduced, which is a development of the 310XT. This version was originally supposed to be released in Q4 of 2011, but the November date had slipped and it was eventually released in Q1 of 2012. New features are the inclusion of the SiRFStar iv chipset, a barometric altimeter, and improved swimming metrics using an accelerometer in the watch. This allowed it to automatically count pool lengths and to recognize swimming styles.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/into-sports/running/forerunner-910xt/prod90671.html|title=Forerunner 910XT - Garmin|publisher=[[Garmin]]|accessdate=3 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nA further addition to the series was the Forerunner 10, a simple watch offering just GPS tracking of activities and run metrics like distance, pace and calories burned.\n\nAt the end of 2013 the Forerunner 220 and 620 were introduced, with color screens, Bluetooth Low energy (BTLE; allowing connections to some smartphones), and, for the 620 only, a touchscreen, Wi-Fi (allowing automatic activity download) and enhanced \"running dynamics\" given by an updated Heart rate monitor. These watches also abandon syncing via the ANT+ protocol in favor of wired (USB) and Wi-Fi (620 only) data transfers. They are also fully waterproof, but do not include any kind of swimming mode.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/into-sports/running/forerunner-220/prod129397.html|title=Forerunner 220 - Garmin|publisher=[[Garmin]]|accessdate=3 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/into-sports/running/forerunner-620/prod122785.html|title=Forerunner 620 - Garmin|publisher=[[Garmin]]|accessdate=3 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, the Forerunner 15 and 920XT were introduced. The 15 is a development of the 10, adding activity tracking, increased battery life, footpod and heart rate monitor capability. The 920XT is the successor of the 910XT, featuring all the capabilities of it (except ANT+ scale and fitness equipment capability) and adding features found in the 620 such as a color screen, Wi-Fi data transfers and running dynamics. Additionally, battery life over the 910XT was improved, daily activity tracking, GLONASS support and a swim drill mode added, and the 920XT is the first Garmin watch extensible with custom apps built using the Garmin Connect IQ software development kit.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/into-sports/running/forerunner-15/prod145621.html|title=Forerunner 15 - Garmin|publisher=[[Garmin]]|accessdate=3 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/into-sports/running/forerunner-920xt/prod137024.html|title=Forerunner 920XT - Garmin|publisher=[[Garmin]]|accessdate=3 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nAnnounced in May 2015, the Forerunner 225 is the first Garmin watch with an integrated optical heart rate monitor.<ref name=\"Garmin\">{{cite web|url=http://garmin.blogs.com/my_weblog/2015/05/forerunner-225-first-garmin-gps-running-watch-with-wrist-based-heart-rate.html#.VVIkN_lViko|title=Introducing the Forerunner\u00ae 225 \u2013 the first Garmin\u00ae GPS running watch with wrist-based heart rate from Mio, developers of industry-leading optical heart rate technology|publisher=[[Garmin]]|accessdate=12 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nAnnounced in May 2016, the Forerunner 735XT is a triathlon-ready Garmin watch with integrated optical heart rate monitor.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://buy.garmin.com/en-GB/GB/sports-recreation/running/forerunner-735xt/prod541225.html#.VVIkN_lViko/|title=Forerunner\u00ae 735XT}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2017, Garmin announced the Forerunner 935, billing it as a watch for running and triathlons with features similar to the Fenix 5. The watch boasts 24/7 wrist-based heart rate monitoring and new advanced training features.<ref name=\"newsroom.garmin.com\">{{cite web|title=Garmin\u00ae introduces the Forerunner\u00ae 935 \u2013 a premium GPS running and triathlon watch with performance monitoring and wrist-based heart rate|url=http://newsroom.garmin.com/press-release/featured-releases/garmin-introduces-forerunner-935-%E2%80%93-premium-gps-running-and-triathlon|website=Garmin Newsroom|publisher=Garmin|accessdate=18 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nOn March 12, 2018, Garmin released the Forerunner 645 and 645 Music marketed as a high end running watch. The watch comes with Garmin Pay, an NFC enabled touchless pay system and the 645 Music is Garmin's first watch with onboard music storage (4 GB).<ref>{{cite web|title=Forerunner 645 Music|url=https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/p/612476|website=Garmin|accessdate=12 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Forerunner 45/45S, released on April 30, 2019, is an entry level running watch. The 45S has a smaller bezel (39mm) than the 45 (42mm) - there are no other differences.  It has a 3rd generation optical heart rate monitor which features stress detection and Body Battery\u2122 energy, along with earlier-generation OHR metrics. Bluetooth connected features include audio prompts, Live Track, and smart notifications. The activity profiles include outdoor running, treadmill, walk, bike, and cadio, with the ability to configure more through Garmin Connect. The Forerunner 45 also has built-in incident detection and assistance, which notifies a predetermined contact if you crash or fall and provides a live track link of your location.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/p/641121|title=Garmin Forerunner\u00ae 45 {{!}} Running Watch|last=Garmin|last2=subsidiaries|first2=Garmin Ltd or its|website=Garmin|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-06}}</ref>\n\nThe Forerunner 245/245 Music, released on April 30, 2019, are mid-range running watches. The 245 has all of the same capabilities as the 245 Music, though the 245 Music allows you to store and play up to 500 song directly on the watch or play music through music streaming services, such as Spotify or Deezer, through wireless bluetooth earphones. The 245 has Garmin Elevate with a 3rd generation optical heart rate monitor which features Pulse Ox, stress detection, Body Battery\u2122 energy, along with earlier-generation OHR metrics. Also new for the Forerunner is a detailed Activity summary screen, improved Race Predictor and Training Status.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/p/646690|title=Garmin Forerunner\u00ae 245 Music {{!}} Running Watch|last=Garmin|last2=subsidiaries|first2=Garmin Ltd or its|website=Garmin|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-06}}</ref>\n\nThe Forerunner 945, released on April 30, 2019, is a triathlon-focused feature-rich watch. The 945  allows you to store and play up to 1000 song directly on the watch or play music through music streaming services, such as Spotify or Deezer, through wireless bluetooth earphones. The 945 has all of the capabilities of its 935 predecessor and all of the features of the Forerunner 245. Garmin Pay.  Other new features of the 945 are heat and altitude acclimation, training load balance, mapping with Tendline\u2122 popularity routing, respiration rate, Around me mode, Climbpro\u2122 future elevation plot, cartography support and topographical maps, XERO\u2122 location, and for the golfer, the 945 is preloaded with 41,000 courses.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/p/621922|title=Garmin Forerunner\u00ae 945 {{!}} Premium Running Watch|last=Garmin|last2=subsidiaries|first2=Garmin Ltd or its|website=Garmin|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-06}}</ref>\n\n==GPS functionality==\n\nThe Forerunner can be used to record historical data by completing a work out and then uploading the data to a computer to create a log of previous exercise activities for analysis.\n\nAdditionally, the Forerunner can be used to navigate during a workout. Users can \"mark\" their current location and then edit this entry's name and coordinates, which enables navigation to those new coordinates. The watch uses the hh.mm.mmmm (hours, minutes, and minute decimals) coordinate format. The 310XT can display additional formats; it also has a screen to display current coordinates in real-time.\n\n==Computer interface==\n\nThe user can download a previously-traveled course/route to the Forerunner using Garmin's Communicator software together with the [[ANT+]] technology, and then follow this course/route to \"race\" against this historical course/route. Until recently this download was possible via the tethered USB connection on the older 205 & 305 models. However, the current version of the software has eliminated this option, requiring the user to acquire a newer model with wireless connection in order to use this feature.\n\nThe user can also make new courses or routes, which can be downloaded to the watch and then followed. This is a convenient way to go on a cross-country bike ride while navigating with the Forerunner. Note: navigating with a course is better than navigating with a route, because a Garmin course can store more points than a Garmin route.\n\nAdditionally, a user can create downloadable points of interest (POIs) by creating a custom map with Google Maps.  POIs can be transferred to the 205 or 305 but not to the 405 or 310XT.\n\n==Models==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! Model !! Release date !!
