A core of ferromagnetic material like iron serves to increase the magnetic field created.<ref name=\"Hyperphysics\" />  The strength of magnetic field generated is proportional to the amount of current through the winding.<ref name=\"Hyperphysics\" />]]\n[[File:VFPt Solenoid correct2.svg|thumb|Magnetic field produced by a [[solenoid]] (coil of wire).  This drawing shows a cross section through the centre of the coil.  The crosses are wires in which current is moving into the page; the dots are wires in which current is moving up out of the page.]]\n\nAn '''electromagnet''' is a type of [[magnet]] in which the [[magnetic field]] is produced by an [[electric current]].  Electromagnets usually consist of wire wound into a [[electromagnetic coil|coil]].  A current through the wire creates a magnetic field which is concentrated in the hole, denoting the centre of the coil. The magnetic field disappears when the current is turned off.  The wire turns are often wound around a [[magnetic core]] made from a [[ferromagnetic]] or [[ferrimagnetic]] material such as [[iron]]; the magnetic core concentrates the [[magnetic flux]] and makes a more powerful magnet.\n\nThe main advantage of an electromagnet over a [[permanent magnet]] is that the magnetic field can be quickly changed by controlling the amount of electric current in the winding. However, unlike a permanent magnet that needs no power, an electromagnet requires a continuous supply of current to maintain the magnetic field.\n\nElectromagnets are widely used as components of other electrical devices, such as [[Electric motor|motors]], [[Electric generator|generators]], [[Solenoid#Applications|electromechanical solenoid]]s, [[relay]]s, [[loudspeaker]]s, [[hard disk]]s, [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI machines]], scientific instruments, and [[magnetic separation]] equipment.  Electromagnets are also employed in industry for picking up and moving heavy iron objects such as scrap iron and steel.<ref name=\"Merzouki\" />\n\n== History ==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header   =\n| image1   = Sturgeon electromagnet.png\n| caption1 = Sturgeon's electromagnet, 1824\n| width1   = 150\n| image2   = Joseph Henry electromagnet.png\n| caption2 = One of Henry's electromagnets that could lift hundreds of pounds, 1830s\n| width2   = 163\n| image3   = Joseph Henry electromagnet closeup.jpg\n| caption3 = Closeup of a large Henry electromagnet\n| width3   = 140\n| footer   =\n}}\n\nDanish scientist [[Hans Christian \u00d8rsted]] discovered in 1820 that electric currents create magnetic fields.

The iron was [[varnish]]ed to insulate it from the windings. When a current was passed through the coil, the iron became magnetized and attracted other pieces of iron; when the current was stopped, it lost magnetization. Sturgeon displayed its power by showing that although it only weighed seven ounces (roughly 200 grams), it could lift nine pounds (roughly 4 kilos) when the current of a single-cell battery was applied. However, Sturgeon's magnets were weak because the uninsulated wire he used could only be wrapped in a single spaced out layer around the core, limiting the number of turns.\n\nBeginning in 1830, US scientist [[Joseph Henry]] systematically improved and popularised the electromagnet.<ref name=\"Cavicchi\">{{cite paper\n |last        = Cavicchi\n |first       = Elizabeth\n |title       = Series and Parallel Experimenting with Electromagnets\n |publisher   = Pavia Project Physics, Univ. of Pavia, Italy\n |url         = http://ppp.unipv.it/Collana/Pages/Libri/Saggi/Volta%20and%20the%20History%20of%20Electricity/V%26H%20Sect4/V%26H%20387-407.pdf\n |format      = PDF\n |accessdate  = August 22, 2015\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20160315231307/http://ppp.unipv.it/Collana/Pages/Libri/Saggi/Volta%20and%20the%20History%20of%20Electricity/V%26H%20Sect4/V%26H%20387-407.pdf\n |archivedate = March 15, 2016\n}}</ref><ref name=\"Sherman\">{{cite web\n |last        = Sherman\n |first       = Roger\n |title       = Joseph Henry's contributions to the electromagnet and the electric motor\n |website        = The Joseph Henry Papers\n |publisher   = The Smithsonian Institution\n |year        = 2007\n |url         = http://siarchives.si.edu/history/exhibits/henry/electromagnetism\n |accessdate  = 2008-08-27\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120608070442/http://siarchives.si.edu/history/exhibits/henry/electromagnetism\n |archivedate = 2012-06-08\n}}</ref>  By using wire insulated by silk thread, and inspired by [[Johann Schweigger|Schweigger]]'s use of multiple turns of wire to make a [[galvanometer]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Schweigger Multiplier \u2013 1820|url=https://nationalmaglab.org/education/magnet-academy/history-of-electricity-magnetism/museum/schweigger-multiplier|website=Maglab|publisher=National High Magnetic Field Laboratory|accessdate=17 October 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171017202030/https://nationalmaglab.org/education/magnet-academy/history-of-electricity-magnetism/museum/schweigger-multiplier|archivedate=17 October 2017}}</ref> he was able to wind multiple layers of wire on cores, creating powerful magnets with thousands of turns of wire, including one that could support {{convert|2063|lb|kg|abbr=on}}.

The solenoid is a coil of wire, and the plunger is made of a material such as soft iron.  Applying a current to the solenoid applies a force to the plunger and may make it move. The plunger stops moving when the forces upon it are balanced. For example, the forces are balanced when the plunger is centered in the solenoid.\n\nThe maximum uniform pull happens when one end of the plunger is at the middle of the solenoid.

The second term within the bracket represents the same force as the stop-less solenoid above; the first term represents the attraction between the stop and the plunger.\n\nSome improvements can be made on the basic design. The ends of the stop and plunger are often conical. For example, the plunger may have a pointed end that fits into a matching recess in the stop. The shape makes the solenoid's pull more uniform as a function of separation. Another improvement is to add a magnetic return path around the outside of the solenoid (an \"iron-clad solenoid\").<ref>{{harvnb|Dawes|1967|loc=p. 15-106}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Underhill |first=Charles R. |date=1906 |title=The Electromagnet |publisher=D.

However, not all electromagnets use cores, and the very strongest electromagnets, such as superconducting and the very high current electromagnets, cannot use them due to saturation.\n\n===Ampere's law===\n'''For definitions of the variables below, see box at end of article.'''\n\nThe magnetic field of electromagnets in the general case is given by [[Ampere's Law]]:\n\n:<math>\\int \\mathbf{J}\\cdot d\\mathbf{A} = \\oint \\mathbf{H}\\cdot d\\mathbf{l}</math>\n\nwhich says that the integral of the magnetizing field H around any closed loop of the field is equal to the sum of the current flowing through the loop.  Another equation used, that gives the magnetic field due to each small segment of current, is the [[Biot\u2013Savart law]].  Computing the magnetic field and force exerted by ferromagnetic materials is difficult for two reasons. First, because the strength of the field varies from point to point in a complicated way, particularly outside the core and in air gaps, where ''fringing fields'' and ''[[leakage flux]]'' must be considered.  Second, because the magnetic field B and force are [[nonlinear]] functions of the current, depending on the nonlinear relation between B and H for the particular core material used.  For precise calculations, computer programs that can produce a model of the magnetic field using the [[finite element method]] are employed.\n\n=== Magnetic core ===\nThe material of a [[magnetic core]] (often made of [[iron]] or steel) is composed of small regions called [[magnetic domains]] that act like tiny magnets (see [[ferromagnetism]]).  Before the current in the electromagnet is turned on, the domains in the iron core point in random directions, so their tiny magnetic fields cancel each other out, and the iron has no large-scale magnetic field.  When a current is passed through the wire wrapped around the iron, its [[magnetic field]] penetrates the iron, and causes the domains to turn, aligning parallel to the magnetic field, so their tiny magnetic fields add to the wire's field, creating a large magnetic field that extends into the space around the magnet. The effect of the core is to concentrate the field, and the magnetic field passes through the core more easily than it would pass through air.\n\nThe larger the current passed through the wire coil, the more the domains align, and the stronger the magnetic field is.  Finally, all the domains are lined up, and further increases in current only cause slight increases in the magnetic field: this phenomenon is called [[Saturation (magnetic)|saturation]].\n\nWhen the current in the coil is turned off, in the magnetically soft materials that are nearly always used as cores, most of the domains lose alignment and return to a random state and the field disappears.  However, some of the alignment persists, because the domains have difficulty turning their direction of magnetization, leaving the core a weak permanent magnet.  This phenomenon is called [[hysteresis]] and the remaining magnetic field is called [[remanence|remanent magnetism]]. The residual magnetization of the core can be removed by [[degaussing]]. In alternating current electromagnets, such as are used in motors, the core's magnetization is constantly reversed, and the remanence contributes to the motor's losses.\n\n=== Magnetic circuit \u2013 the constant ''B'' field approximation ===\n[[Image:Electromagnet with gap.svg|thumb|upright=1.7|Magnetic field ''(<span style=\"color:green;\">green</span>)'' of a typical electromagnet, with the iron core ''C'' forming a closed loop with two air gaps ''G'' in it.<br /> \n''B'' \u2013 magnetic field in the core<br />\n''B<sub>F</sub>'' \u2013 \"fringing fields\".

It is the sum of the length ''L<sub>core</sub>'' in the iron core pieces and the length ''L<sub>gap</sub>'' in the air gaps ''G''.<br />\nBoth the leakage flux and the fringing fields get larger as the gaps are increased, reducing the force exerted by the magnet. ]]\n\nIn many practical applications of electromagnets, such as motors, generators, transformers, lifting magnets, and loudspeakers, the iron core is in the form of a loop or [[magnetic circuit]], possibly broken by a few narrow air gaps.<ref name=\"Merzouki\"/>  This is because the magnetic field lines are in the form of closed loops. Iron presents much less \"resistance\" ([[reluctance]]) to the magnetic field than air, so a stronger field can be obtained if most of the magnetic field's path is within the core.<ref name=\"Merzouki\" />\n\nSince most of the magnetic field is confined within the outlines of the core loop, this allows a simplification of the mathematical analysis.<ref name=\"Merzouki\" />  See the drawing at right.  A common simplifying assumption satisfied by many electromagnets, which will be used in this section, is that the magnetic field strength ''B'' is constant around the magnetic circuit (within the core and air gaps) and zero outside it.  Most of the magnetic field will be concentrated in the core material ''(C)''.  Within the core the magnetic field ''(B)'' will be approximately uniform across any cross section, so if in addition the core has roughly constant area throughout its length, the field in the core will be constant.<ref name=\"Merzouki\" />  This just leaves the air gaps ''(G)'', if any, between core sections.   In the gaps the magnetic field lines are no longer confined by the core, so they 'bulge' out beyond the outlines of the core before curving back to enter the next piece of core material, reducing the field strength in the gap.<ref name=\"Merzouki\" />  The bulges ''(B<sub>F</sub>)'' are called ''fringing fields''.<ref name=\"Merzouki\" />  However, as long as the length of the gap is smaller than the cross section dimensions of the core, the field in the gap will be approximately the same as in the core.  In addition, some of the magnetic field lines ''(B<sub>L</sub>)'' will take 'short cuts' and not pass through the entire core circuit, and thus will not contribute to the force exerted by the magnet.  This also includes field lines that encircle the wire windings but do not enter the core.  This is called ''[[leakage flux]]''.   Therefore, the equations in this section are valid for electromagnets for which:\n# the magnetic circuit is a single loop of core material, possibly broken by a few air gaps\n# the core has roughly the same cross sectional area throughout its length.\n# any air gaps between sections of core material are not large compared with the cross sectional dimensions of the core.\n# there is negligible leakage flux\nThe main nonlinear feature of [[ferromagnetic]] materials is that the B field [[magnetic saturation|saturates]] at a certain value,<ref name=\"Merzouki\" /> which is around 1.6 to 2 [[Tesla (unit)|teslas]] (T) for most high permeability core steels.<ref name=\"Pauley\">\"''Saturation flux levels of various magnetic materials range up to 24.5 kilogauss''\" (2.5 T) p.1  \"''Silicon steel saturates at about 17 kilogauss''\" (1.7 T) p.3  {{cite journal| last =Pauley| first =Donald E.| title =Power Supply Magnetics Part 1: Selecting transformer/inductor core material| journal =Power Conversion and Intelligent Motion| date =March 1996| url =http://www.arnoldmagnetics.com/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=4396| accessdate =September 19, 2014| url-status =dead| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20141224075136/http://www.arnoldmagnetics.com/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=4396| archivedate =December 24, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"MagneticMaterials\">The most widely used magnetic core material, 3% silicon steel, has saturation induction of 20 kilogauss (2 T). {{cite web\n |title       = Material Properties, 3% grain-oriented silicon steel| page = 16\n |website        = Catalog\n |publisher   =  Magnetic Materials Co. \n |date        = 2013\n |url         = http://ludens.cl/Electron/Magnet.html\n |accessdate  = September 19, 2014\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20140920230119/http://ludens.cl/Electron/Magnet.html\n |archivedate = September 20, 2014\n}}</ref><ref name=\"Short\">\"''Magnetic steel fully saturates at about 2 T''\" {{cite book\n |last1       = Short\n |first1      = Thomas Allen\n |title       = Electric Power Distribution Handbook\n |publisher   = CRC Press\n |date        = 2003\n |pages       = 214\n |url         = https://books.google.com/books?id=mVW2D_6XB5EC&pg=PA214\n |isbn        = 978-0203486504\n |url-status     = live\n}}</ref>  The B field increases quickly with increasing current up to that value, but above that value the field levels off and becomes almost constant, regardless of how much current is sent through the windings.<ref name=\"Merzouki\" />   So the maximum strength of the magnetic field possible from an iron core electromagnet is limited to around 1.6 to 2 T.<ref name=\"Pauley\" /><ref name=\"Short\" />\n\n=== Magnetic field created by a current ===\nThe magnetic field created by an electromagnet is proportional to both the number of turns in the winding, ''N'', and the current in the wire, ''I'', hence this product, ''NI'', in [[Ampere (unit)|ampere]]-turns, is given the name [[magnetomotive force]].

For an exact solution, the value of ''\u03bc'' at the ''B'' value used must be obtained from the core material [[Hysteresis loop|hysteresis curve]].<ref name=\"Merzouki\" />  If ''B'' is unknown, the equation must be solved by [[Numerical analysis|numerical methods]].  However, if the magnetomotive force is well above saturation, so the core material is in saturation, the magnetic field will be approximately the saturation value ''B<sub>sat</sub>'' for the material, and won't vary much with changes in ''NI''.  For a closed magnetic circuit (no air gap) most core materials saturate at a magnetomotive force of roughly 800 ampere-turns per meter of flux path.\n\nFor most core materials, <math>\\mu_r = \\mu / \\mu_0 \\approx 2000 - 6000\\,</math>.<ref name=\"Fitzgerald\" />  So in equation (1) above, the second term dominates.  Therefore, in magnetic circuits with an air gap, the strength of the magnetic field ''B'' depends strongly on the length of the air gap, and the length of the flux path in the core doesn't matter much. Given an air gap of 1mm, a magnetomotive force of about 796 Ampere-turns is required to produce a magnetic field of 1T.\n\n=== Force exerted by magnetic field ===\nThe force exerted by an electromagnet on a section of core material is:\n\n:<math>F = \\frac{B^2 A}{2 \\mu_0}   \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad (2)   \\,</math>\n\nwhere <math>A</math> is the cross-sectional area of the core.  The force equation can be derived from the [[Magnetic energy|energy stored in a magnetic field]]. [[Energy]] is force times distance. Rearranging terms yields the equation above.\n\nThe 1.6&nbsp;T limit on the field<ref name=\"Pauley\" /><ref name=\"Short\" /> mentioned above sets a limit on the maximum force per unit core area, or [[magnetic pressure]], an iron-core electromagnet can exert; roughly:\n\n:<math>\\frac{F}{A} = \\frac {B_{sat}^2}{2 \\mu_0}  \\approx 1000\\ \\mathrm{kPa} = 10^6 \\mathrm{N/m^2} = 145\\ \\mathrm{lbf} \\cdot \\mathrm{in}^{-2}\\,</math>\n<!--(1.6**2)/(2*4*pi*10**-7)-->\nIn more intuitive units it's useful to remember that at 1&nbsp;T the magnetic pressure is approximately 4 atmospheres, or kg/cm<sup>2</sup>.\n\nGiven a core geometry, the B field needed for a given force can be calculated from (2); if it comes out to much more than 1.6 T, a larger core must be used.\n\n=== Closed magnetic circuit ===\n[[File: Lifting electromagnet cross section.png|thumb|Cross section of lifting electromagnet like that in above photo, showing cylindrical construction. The windings ''(C)'' are flat copper strips to withstand the Lorentz force of the magnetic field.  The core is formed by the thick iron housing ''(D)'' that wraps around the windings.]]\n\nFor a closed magnetic circuit (no air gap), such as would be found in an electromagnet lifting a piece of iron bridged across its poles, equation (1) becomes:\n\n:<math>B = \\frac{NI\\mu}{L}  \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad (3)  \\,</math>\n\nSubstituting into (2), the force is:\n\n:<math>F = \\frac{\\mu^2 N^2 I^2 A}{2\\mu_0 L^2}  \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad (4)  \\,</math>\n\nIt can be seen that to maximize the force, a core with a short flux path ''L'' and a wide cross-sectional area ''A'' is preferred (this also applies to magnets with an air gap).  To achieve this, in applications like lifting magnets (see photo above) and [[loudspeaker]]s a flat cylindrical design is often used.  The winding is wrapped around a short wide cylindrical core that forms one pole, and a thick metal housing that wraps around the outside of the windings forms the other part of the magnetic circuit, bringing the magnetic field to the front to form the other pole.\n\n=== Force between electromagnets ===\nThe above methods are applicable to electromagnets with a [[magnetic circuit]] and do not apply when a large part of the magnetic field path is outside the core.  An example would be a magnet with a straight cylindrical core like the one shown at the top of this article. For electromagnets (or permanent magnets) with well defined 'poles' where the field lines emerge from the core, the force between two electromagnets can be found using the 'Gilbert model' which assumes the magnetic field is produced by fictitious 'magnetic charges' on the surface of the poles, with pole strength ''m'' and units of [[Ampere (unit)|Ampere]]-turn meter.  Magnetic pole strength of electromagnets can be found from:\n\n<math>m = \\frac{NIA}{L}</math>\n\nThe force between two poles is:\n\n<math>F = \\frac{\\mu_0 m_1 m_2}{4\\pi r^2}</math>\n\nThis model doesn't give the correct magnetic field inside the core and thus gives incorrect results if the pole of one magnet gets too close to another magnet.\n\nhi\n\n== High field electromagnets ==\n\n=== Superconducting electromagnets ===\n[[Image:Small small IMG 0836.jpg|thumb|The most powerful electromagnet in the world, the 45 T hybrid Bitter-superconducting magnet at the US National High Magnetic Field Laboratory, Tallahassee, Florida, USA]]\n\n{{main|Superconducting magnet}}\nWhen a magnetic field higher than the ferromagnetic limit of 1.6 T is needed, [[Superconducting magnet|superconducting electromagnets]] can be used.

Electromagnets usually consist of wire wound into a [[electromagnetic coil|coil]].  A current through the wire creates a magnetic field which is concentrated in the hole, denoting the centre of the coil. The magnetic field disappears when the current is turned off.  The wire turns are often wound around a [[magnetic core]] made from a [[ferromagnetic]] or [[ferrimagnetic]] material such as [[iron]]; the magnetic core concentrates the [[magnetic flux]] and makes a more powerful magnet.\n\nThe main advantage of an electromagnet over a [[permanent magnet]] is that the magnetic field can be quickly changed by controlling the amount of electric current in the winding. However, unlike a permanent magnet that needs no power, an electromagnet requires a continuous supply of current to maintain the magnetic field.\n\nElectromagnets are widely used as components of other electrical devices, such as [[Electric motor|motors]], [[Electric generator|generators]], [[Solenoid#Applications|electromechanical solenoid]]s, [[relay]]s, [[loudspeaker]]s, [[hard disk]]s, [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI machines]], scientific instruments, and [[magnetic separation]] equipment.

The iron was [[varnish]]ed to insulate it from the windings. When a current was passed through the coil, the iron became magnetized and attracted other pieces of iron; when the current was stopped, it lost magnetization. Sturgeon displayed its power by showing that although it only weighed seven ounces (roughly 200 grams), it could lift nine pounds (roughly 4 kilos) when the current of a single-cell battery was applied. However, Sturgeon's magnets were weak because the uninsulated wire he used could only be wrapped in a single spaced out layer around the core, limiting the number of turns.\n\nBeginning in 1830, US scientist [[Joseph Henry]] systematically improved and popularised the electromagnet.<ref name=\"Cavicchi\">{{cite paper\n |last        = Cavicchi\n |first       = Elizabeth\n |title       = Series and Parallel Experimenting with Electromagnets\n |publisher   = Pavia Project Physics, Univ. of Pavia, Italy\n |url         = http://ppp.unipv.it/Collana/Pages/Libri/Saggi/Volta%20and%20the%20History%20of%20Electricity/V%26H%20Sect4/V%26H%20387-407.pdf\n |format      = PDF\n |accessdate  = August 22, 2015\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20160315231307/http://ppp.unipv.it/Collana/Pages/Libri/Saggi/Volta%20and%20the%20History%20of%20Electricity/V%26H%20Sect4/V%26H%20387-407.pdf\n |archivedate = March 15, 2016\n}}</ref><ref name=\"Sherman\">{{cite web\n |last        = Sherman\n |first       = Roger\n |title       = Joseph Henry's contributions to the electromagnet and the electric motor\n |website        = The Joseph Henry Papers\n |publisher   = The Smithsonian Institution\n |year        = 2007\n |url         = http://siarchives.si.edu/history/exhibits/henry/electromagnetism\n |accessdate  = 2008-08-27\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120608070442/http://siarchives.si.edu/history/exhibits/henry/electromagnetism\n |archivedate = 2012-06-08\n}}</ref>  By using wire insulated by silk thread, and inspired by [[Johann Schweigger|Schweigger]]'s use of multiple turns of wire to make a [[galvanometer]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Schweigger Multiplier \u2013 1820|url=https://nationalmaglab.org/education/magnet-academy/history-of-electricity-magnetism/museum/schweigger-multiplier|website=Maglab|publisher=National High Magnetic Field Laboratory|accessdate=17 October 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171017202030/https://nationalmaglab.org/education/magnet-academy/history-of-electricity-magnetism/museum/schweigger-multiplier|archivedate=17 October 2017}}</ref> he was able to wind multiple layers of wire on cores, creating powerful magnets with thousands of turns of wire, including one that could support {{convert|2063|lb|kg|abbr=on}}.

The solenoid is a coil of wire, and the plunger is made of a material such as soft iron.  Applying a current to the solenoid applies a force to the plunger and may make it move. The plunger stops moving when the forces upon it are balanced. For example, the forces are balanced when the plunger is centered in the solenoid.\n\nThe maximum uniform pull happens when one end of the plunger is at the middle of the solenoid. An approximation for the force {{mvar|F}} is<ref name=\"Marks 105\"/>\n:<math>F = C A n I / l</math>\nwhere {{mvar|C}} is a proportionality constant, {{mvar|A}} is the cross-sectional area of the plunger, {{mvar|n}} is the number of turns in the solenoid, {{mvar|I}} is the current through the solenoid wire, and {{mvar|l}} is the length of the solenoid. For units using inches, pounds force, and amperes with long, slender, solenoids, the value of {{mvar|C}} is around 0.009 to 0.010&nbsp;psi (maximum pull pounds per square inch of plunger cross-sectional area).<ref name=\"Marks 105-6\">{{harvnb|Dawes|1967|loc=p. 15-105\u201315-106}}</ref> For example, a 12-inch long coil ({{math|1=''l''=12 in}}) with a long plunger of 1-square inch cross section ({{math|1=''A''=1 in<sup>2</sup>}}) and 11,200 [[ampere-turn]]s ({{math|1=''n I''=11,200 Aturn}}) had a maximum pull of 8.75 pounds (corresponding to {{math|1=''C''=0.0094 psi}}).<ref>{{harvnb|Dawes|1967|loc=p. 15-106, Table 25}}</ref>\n\nThe maximum pull is increased when a magnetic stop is inserted into the solenoid. The stop becomes a magnet that will attract the plunger; it adds little to the solenoid pull when the plunger is far away but dramatically increases the pull when they are close. An approximation for the pull {{mvar|P}} is<ref>{{harvnb|Dawes|1967|loc=p. 15-106}}</ref>\n:<math>P = A n I [(n I / l_\\mathrm{a}^2C_1^2) + (C /l)] = (A n^2 I^2 / l_\\mathrm{a}^2C_1^2) + (C A n I/l)</math>\nHere {{math|''l''<sub>a</sub>}} is the distance between the end of the stop and the end of the plunger. The additional constant {{math|''C''<sub>1</sub>}} for units of inches, pounds, and amperes with slender solenoids is about 2660<!-- units -->. The second term within the bracket represents the same force as the stop-less solenoid above; the first term represents the attraction between the stop and the plunger.\n\nSome improvements can be made on the basic design. The ends of the stop and plunger are often conical. For example, the plunger may have a pointed end that fits into a matching recess in the stop. The shape makes the solenoid's pull more uniform as a function of separation. Another improvement is to add a magnetic return path around the outside of the solenoid (an \"iron-clad solenoid\").<ref>{{harvnb|Dawes|1967|loc=p. 15-106}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Underhill |first=Charles R. |date=1906 |title=The Electromagnet |publisher=D.

However, not all electromagnets use cores, and the very strongest electromagnets, such as superconducting and the very high current electromagnets, cannot use them due to saturation.\n\n===Ampere's law===\n'''For definitions of the variables below, see box at end of article.'''\n\nThe magnetic field of electromagnets in the general case is given by [[Ampere's Law]]:\n\n:<math>\\int \\mathbf{J}\\cdot d\\mathbf{A} = \\oint \\mathbf{H}\\cdot d\\mathbf{l}</math>\n\nwhich says that the integral of the magnetizing field H around any closed loop of the field is equal to the sum of the current flowing through the loop.  Another equation used, that gives the magnetic field due to each small segment of current, is the [[Biot\u2013Savart law]].  Computing the magnetic field and force exerted by ferromagnetic materials is difficult for two reasons. First, because the strength of the field varies from point to point in a complicated way, particularly outside the core and in air gaps, where ''fringing fields'' and ''[[leakage flux]]'' must be considered.  Second, because the magnetic field B and force are [[nonlinear]] functions of the current, depending on the nonlinear relation between B and H for the particular core material used.  For precise calculations, computer programs that can produce a model of the magnetic field using the [[finite element method]] are employed.\n\n=== Magnetic core ===\nThe material of a [[magnetic core]] (often made of [[iron]] or steel) is composed of small regions called [[magnetic domains]] that act like tiny magnets (see [[ferromagnetism]]).  Before the current in the electromagnet is turned on, the domains in the iron core point in random directions, so their tiny magnetic fields cancel each other out, and the iron has no large-scale magnetic field.  When a current is passed through the wire wrapped around the iron, its [[magnetic field]] penetrates the iron, and causes the domains to turn, aligning parallel to the magnetic field, so their tiny magnetic fields add to the wire's field, creating a large magnetic field that extends into the space around the magnet. The effect of the core is to concentrate the field, and the magnetic field passes through the core more easily than it would pass through air.\n\nThe larger the current passed through the wire coil, the more the domains align, and the stronger the magnetic field is.  Finally, all the domains are lined up, and further increases in current only cause slight increases in the magnetic field: this phenomenon is called [[Saturation (magnetic)|saturation]].\n\nWhen the current in the coil is turned off, in the magnetically soft materials that are nearly always used as cores, most of the domains lose alignment and return to a random state and the field disappears.  However, some of the alignment persists, because the domains have difficulty turning their direction of magnetization, leaving the core a weak permanent magnet.  This phenomenon is called [[hysteresis]] and the remaining magnetic field is called [[remanence|remanent magnetism]]. The residual magnetization of the core can be removed by [[degaussing]]. In alternating current electromagnets, such as are used in motors, the core's magnetization is constantly reversed, and the remanence contributes to the motor's losses.\n\n=== Magnetic circuit \u2013 the constant ''B'' field approximation ===\n[[Image:Electromagnet with gap.svg|thumb|upright=1.7|Magnetic field ''(<span style=\"color:green;\">green</span>)'' of a typical electromagnet, with the iron core ''C'' forming a closed loop with two air gaps ''G'' in it.<br /> \n''B'' \u2013 magnetic field in the core<br />\n''B<sub>F</sub>'' \u2013 \"fringing fields\".  In the gaps ''G'' the magnetic field lines \"bulge\" out, so the field strength is less than in the core:   ''B<sub>F</sub>''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''B''<br />\n''B<sub>L</sub>''  \u2013 [[leakage flux]]; magnetic field lines which don't follow complete magnetic circuit<br />\n''L'' \u2013 average length of the magnetic circuit used in eq. 1 below.  It is the sum of the length ''L<sub>core</sub>'' in the iron core pieces and the length ''L<sub>gap</sub>'' in the air gaps ''G''.<br />\nBoth the leakage flux and the fringing fields get larger as the gaps are increased, reducing the force exerted by the magnet. ]]\n\nIn many practical applications of electromagnets, such as motors, generators, transformers, lifting magnets, and loudspeakers, the iron core is in the form of a loop or [[magnetic circuit]], possibly broken by a few narrow air gaps.<ref name=\"Merzouki\"/>  This is because the magnetic field lines are in the form of closed loops. Iron presents much less \"resistance\" ([[reluctance]]) to the magnetic field than air, so a stronger field can be obtained if most of the magnetic field's path is within the core.<ref name=\"Merzouki\" />\n\nSince most of the magnetic field is confined within the outlines of the core loop, this allows a simplification of the mathematical analysis.<ref name=\"Merzouki\" />  See the drawing at right.  A common simplifying assumption satisfied by many electromagnets, which will be used in this section, is that the magnetic field strength ''B'' is constant around the magnetic circuit (within the core and air gaps) and zero outside it.  Most of the magnetic field will be concentrated in the core material ''(C)''.  Within the core the magnetic field ''(B)'' will be approximately uniform across any cross section, so if in addition the core has roughly constant area throughout its length, the field in the core will be constant.<ref name=\"Merzouki\" />  This just leaves the air gaps ''(G)'', if any, between core sections.   In the gaps the magnetic field lines are no longer confined by the core, so they 'bulge' out beyond the outlines of the core before curving back to enter the next piece of core material, reducing the field strength in the gap.<ref name=\"Merzouki\" />  The bulges ''(B<sub>F</sub>)'' are called ''fringing fields''.<ref name=\"Merzouki\" />  However, as long as the length of the gap is smaller than the cross section dimensions of the core, the field in the gap will be approximately the same as in the core.  In addition, some of the magnetic field lines ''(B<sub>L</sub>)'' will take 'short cuts' and not pass through the entire core circuit, and thus will not contribute to the force exerted by the magnet.  This also includes field lines that encircle the wire windings but do not enter the core.  This is called ''[[leakage flux]]''.   Therefore, the equations in this section are valid for electromagnets for which:\n# the magnetic circuit is a single loop of core material, possibly broken by a few air gaps\n# the core has roughly the same cross sectional area throughout its length.\n# any air gaps between sections of core material are not large compared with the cross sectional dimensions of the core.\n# there is negligible leakage flux\nThe main nonlinear feature of [[ferromagnetic]] materials is that the B field [[magnetic saturation|saturates]] at a certain value,<ref name=\"Merzouki\" /> which is around 1.6 to 2 [[Tesla (unit)|teslas]] (T) for most high permeability core steels.<ref name=\"Pauley\">\"''Saturation flux levels of various magnetic materials range up to 24.5 kilogauss''\" (2.5 T) p.1  \"''Silicon steel saturates at about 17 kilogauss''\" (1.7 T) p.3  {{cite journal| last =Pauley| first =Donald E.| title =Power Supply Magnetics Part 1: Selecting transformer/inductor core material| journal =Power Conversion and Intelligent Motion| date =March 1996| url =http://www.arnoldmagnetics.com/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=4396| accessdate =September 19, 2014| url-status =dead| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20141224075136/http://www.arnoldmagnetics.com/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=4396| archivedate =December 24, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"MagneticMaterials\">The most widely used magnetic core material, 3% silicon steel, has saturation induction of 20 kilogauss (2 T). {{cite web\n |title       = Material Properties, 3% grain-oriented silicon steel| page = 16\n |website        = Catalog\n |publisher   =  Magnetic Materials Co. \n |date        = 2013\n |url         = http://ludens.cl/Electron/Magnet.html\n |accessdate  = September 19, 2014\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20140920230119/http://ludens.cl/Electron/Magnet.html\n |archivedate = September 20, 2014\n}}</ref><ref name=\"Short\">\"''Magnetic steel fully saturates at about 2 T''\" {{cite book\n |last1       = Short\n |first1      = Thomas Allen\n |title       = Electric Power Distribution Handbook\n |publisher   = CRC Press\n |date        = 2003\n |pages       = 214\n |url         = https://books.google.com/books?id=mVW2D_6XB5EC&pg=PA214\n |isbn        = 978-0203486504\n |url-status     = live\n}}</ref>  The B field increases quickly with increasing current up to that value, but above that value the field levels off and becomes almost constant, regardless of how much current is sent through the windings.<ref name=\"Merzouki\" />   So the maximum strength of the magnetic field possible from an iron core electromagnet is limited to around 1.6 to 2 T.<ref name=\"Pauley\" /><ref name=\"Short\" />\n\n=== Magnetic field created by a current ===\nThe magnetic field created by an electromagnet is proportional to both the number of turns in the winding, ''N'', and the current in the wire, ''I'', hence this product, ''NI'', in [[Ampere (unit)|ampere]]-turns, is given the name [[magnetomotive force]].

For an exact solution, the value of ''\u03bc'' at the ''B'' value used must be obtained from the core material [[Hysteresis loop|hysteresis curve]].<ref name=\"Merzouki\" />  If ''B'' is unknown, the equation must be solved by [[Numerical analysis|numerical methods]].  However, if the magnetomotive force is well above saturation, so the core material is in saturation, the magnetic field will be approximately the saturation value ''B<sub>sat</sub>'' for the material, and won't vary much with changes in ''NI''.  For a closed magnetic circuit (no air gap) most core materials saturate at a magnetomotive force of roughly 800 ampere-turns per meter of flux path.\n\nFor most core materials, <math>\\mu_r = \\mu / \\mu_0 \\approx 2000 - 6000\\,</math>.<ref name=\"Fitzgerald\" />  So in equation (1) above, the second term dominates.  Therefore, in magnetic circuits with an air gap, the strength of the magnetic field ''B'' depends strongly on the length of the air gap, and the length of the flux path in the core doesn't matter much. Given an air gap of 1mm, a magnetomotive force of about 796 Ampere-turns is required to produce a magnetic field of 1T.\n\n=== Force exerted by magnetic field ===\nThe force exerted by an electromagnet on a section of core material is:\n\n:<math>F = \\frac{B^2 A}{2 \\mu_0}   \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad (2)   \\,</math>\n\nwhere <math>A</math> is the cross-sectional area of the core.  The force equation can be derived from the [[Magnetic energy|energy stored in a magnetic field]]. [[Energy]] is force times distance. Rearranging terms yields the equation above.\n\nThe 1.6&nbsp;T limit on the field<ref name=\"Pauley\" /><ref name=\"Short\" /> mentioned above sets a limit on the maximum force per unit core area, or [[magnetic pressure]], an iron-core electromagnet can exert; roughly:\n\n:<math>\\frac{F}{A} = \\frac {B_{sat}^2}{2 \\mu_0}  \\approx 1000\\ \\mathrm{kPa} = 10^6 \\mathrm{N/m^2} = 145\\ \\mathrm{lbf} \\cdot \\mathrm{in}^{-2}\\,</math>\n<!--(1.6**2)/(2*4*pi*10**-7)-->\nIn more intuitive units it's useful to remember that at 1&nbsp;T the magnetic pressure is approximately 4 atmospheres, or kg/cm<sup>2</sup>.\n\nGiven a core geometry, the B field needed for a given force can be calculated from (2); if it comes out to much more than 1.6 T, a larger core must be used.\n\n=== Closed magnetic circuit ===\n[[File: Lifting electromagnet cross section.png|thumb|Cross section of lifting electromagnet like that in above photo, showing cylindrical construction. The windings ''(C)'' are flat copper strips to withstand the Lorentz force of the magnetic field.  The core is formed by the thick iron housing ''(D)'' that wraps around the windings.]]\n\nFor a closed magnetic circuit (no air gap), such as would be found in an electromagnet lifting a piece of iron bridged across its poles, equation (1) becomes:\n\n:<math>B = \\frac{NI\\mu}{L}  \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad (3)  \\,</math>\n\nSubstituting into (2), the force is:\n\n:<math>F = \\frac{\\mu^2 N^2 I^2 A}{2\\mu_0 L^2}  \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad (4)  \\,</math>\n\nIt can be seen that to maximize the force, a core with a short flux path ''L'' and a wide cross-sectional area ''A'' is preferred (this also applies to magnets with an air gap).  To achieve this, in applications like lifting magnets (see photo above) and [[loudspeaker]]s a flat cylindrical design is often used.  The winding is wrapped around a short wide cylindrical core that forms one pole, and a thick metal housing that wraps around the outside of the windings forms the other part of the magnetic circuit, bringing the magnetic field to the front to form the other pole.\n\n=== Force between electromagnets ===\nThe above methods are applicable to electromagnets with a [[magnetic circuit]] and do not apply when a large part of the magnetic field path is outside the core.  An example would be a magnet with a straight cylindrical core like the one shown at the top of this article. For electromagnets (or permanent magnets) with well defined 'poles' where the field lines emerge from the core, the force between two electromagnets can be found using the 'Gilbert model' which assumes the magnetic field is produced by fictitious 'magnetic charges' on the surface of the poles, with pole strength ''m'' and units of [[Ampere (unit)|Ampere]]-turn meter.  Magnetic pole strength of electromagnets can be found from:\n\n<math>m = \\frac{NIA}{L}</math>\n\nThe force between two poles is:\n\n<math>F = \\frac{\\mu_0 m_1 m_2}{4\\pi r^2}</math>\n\nThis model doesn't give the correct magnetic field inside the core and thus gives incorrect results if the pole of one magnet gets too close to another magnet.\n\n==Side effects==\nThere are several side effects which occur in electromagnets which must be provided for in their design.  These generally become more significant in larger electromagnets.\n\n===Ohmic heating===\n[[Image:Current carrying busbars at the LNCMI.jpg|thumb|Large aluminum busbars carrying current into the electromagnets at the [[LNCMI]] (Laboratoire National des Champs Magn\u00e9tiques Intenses) high field laboratory.]]\n\nThe only power consumed in a [[Direct current|DC]] electromagnet under steady state conditions is due to the [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] of the windings, and is dissipated as heat.  Some large electromagnets require cooling water circulating through pipes in the windings to carry off the [[waste heat]].\n\nSince the magnetic field is proportional to the product ''NI'', the number of turns in the windings ''N'' and the current ''I'' can be chosen to minimize heat losses, as long as their product is constant.   Since the power dissipation, ''P = I<sup>2</sup>R'', increases with the square of the current but only increases approximately linearly with the number of windings, the power lost in the windings can be minimized by reducing ''I'' and increasing the number of turns ''N'' proportionally, or using thicker wire to reduce the resistance.  For example, halving I and doubling N halves the power loss, as does doubling the area of the wire. In either case, increasing the amount of wire reduces the ohmic losses. For this reason, electromagnets often have a significant thickness of windings.\n\nHowever, the limit to increasing ''N'' or lowering the resistance is that the windings take up more room between the magnet's core pieces.  If the area available for the windings is filled up, more turns require going to a smaller diameter of wire, which has higher resistance, which cancels the advantage of using more turns.  So in large magnets there is a minimum amount of heat loss that can't be reduced.  This increases with the square of the [[magnetic flux]] ''B<sup>2</sup>''.\n\n===Inductive voltage spikes===\nAn electromagnet has significant [[inductance]], and resists changes in the current through its windings.  Any sudden changes in the winding current cause large voltage spikes across the windings.  This is because when the current through the magnet is increased, such as when it is turned on, energy from the circuit must be stored in the magnetic field.  When it is turned off the energy in the field is returned to the circuit.\n\nIf an ordinary [[switch]] is used to control the winding current, this can cause sparks at the terminals of the switch.  This doesn't occur when the magnet is switched on, because the limited supply voltage causes the current through the magnet and the field energy to increase slowly,  but when it is switched off, the energy in the magnetic field is suddenly returned to the circuit, causing a large voltage spike and an [[Electric arc|arc]] across the switch contacts, which can damage them.  With small electromagnets a [[capacitor]] is sometimes used across the contacts, which reduces arcing by temporarily storing the current.  More often a [[diode]] is used to prevent voltage spikes by providing a path for the current to recirculate through the winding until the energy is dissipated as heat.  The diode is connected across the winding, oriented so it is reverse-biased during steady state operation and doesn't conduct.  When the supply voltage is removed, the voltage spike forward-biases the diode and the reactive current continues to flow through the winding, through the diode and back into the winding. A diode used in this way is called a [[freewheeling diode]] or [[flyback diode]].\n\nLarge electromagnets are usually powered by variable current electronic [[power supply|power supplies]], controlled by a [[microprocessor]],  which prevent voltage spikes by accomplishing current changes slowly, in gentle ramps.  It may take several minutes to energize or deenergize a large magnet. \n\n===Lorentz forces===\nIn powerful electromagnets, the magnetic field exerts a force on each turn of the windings, due to the [[Lorentz force]] <math>q\\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\,</math>   acting on the moving charges within the wire.  The Lorentz force is perpendicular to both the axis of the wire and the magnetic field.  It can be visualized as a pressure between the [[magnetic field lines]], pushing them apart.  It has two effects on an electromagnet's windings:\n* The field lines within the axis of the coil exert a radial force on each turn of the windings, tending to push them outward in all directions. This causes a [[tensile stress]] in the wire.\n* The leakage field lines between each turn of the coil exert a repulsive force between adjacent turns, tending to push them apart.\nThe Lorentz forces increase with ''B<sup>2</sup>''.   In large electromagnets the windings must be firmly clamped in place, to prevent motion on power-up and power-down from causing [[metal fatigue]] in the windings.  In the [[Bitter electromagnet|Bitter]] design, below, used in very high field research magnets, the windings are constructed as flat disks to resist the radial forces, and clamped in an axial direction to resist the axial ones.\n\n===Core losses===\nIn [[alternating current]] (AC) electromagnets, used in [[transformer]]s, [[inductor]]s, and [[AC motor]]s and [[Electric generator|generators]], the magnetic field is constantly changing.  This causes energy losses in their [[magnetic core]]s that is dissipated as heat in the core.  The losses stem from two processes:\n* ''[[Eddy current]]s'': From [[Faraday's law of induction]], the changing magnetic field induces circulating [[electric current]]s inside nearby conductors,  called [[eddy current]]s.  The energy in these currents is dissipated as heat in the [[electrical resistance]] of the conductor, so they are a cause of energy loss.   Since the magnet's iron core is conductive, and most of the magnetic field is concentrated there, [[eddy current]]s in the core are the major problem.  Eddy currents are closed loops of current that flow in planes perpendicular to the magnetic field.  The energy dissipated is proportional to the area enclosed by the loop. To prevent them, the cores of AC electromagnets are made of stacks of thin steel sheets, or [[lamination]]s, oriented parallel to the magnetic field, with an insulating coating on the surface.  The insulation layers prevent eddy current from flowing between the sheets.  Any remaining eddy currents must flow within the cross-section of each individual lamination, which reduces losses greatly.  Another alternative is to use a [[ferrite core]], which is a nonconductor.\n* ''[[Hysteresis loss]]es'': Reversing the direction of magnetization of the [[magnetic domain]]s in the core material each cycle causes energy loss, because of the [[coercivity]] of the material.  These losses are called [[hysteresis]].  The energy lost per cycle is proportional to the area of the [[hysteresis loop]] in the ''BH'' graph.  To minimize this loss, magnetic cores used in transformers and other AC electromagnets are made of \"soft\" low coercivity materials, such as [[silicon steel]] or [[soft ferrite]].\nThe energy loss per cycle of the AC current is constant for each of these processes, so the power loss increases linearly with [[frequency]].\n\n== High field electromagnets ==\n\n=== Superconducting electromagnets ===\n[[Image:Small small IMG 0836.jpg|thumb|The most powerful electromagnet in the world, the 45 T hybrid Bitter-superconducting magnet at the US National High Magnetic Field Laboratory, Tallahassee, Florida, USA]]\n\n{{main|Superconducting magnet}}\nWhen a magnetic field higher than the ferromagnetic limit of 1.6 T is needed, [[Superconducting magnet|superconducting electromagnets]] can be used.  Instead of using ferromagnetic materials, these use [[Superconductivity|superconducting]] windings cooled with [[liquid helium]], which conduct current without [[electrical resistance]].  These allow enormous currents to flow, which generate intense magnetic fields.  Superconducting magnets are limited by the field strength at which the winding material ceases to be superconducting.

Written by [[Bryan Woods]], [[Scott Beck]] and Krasinski, the plot revolves around a father (Krasinski) and a mother ([[Emily Blunt]]) who struggle to survive and raise their children in a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] world inhabited by blind [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] creatures with an acute sense of hearing.\n\nBeck and Woods had begun developing a story that would lead into the film at college. In July 2016, Krasinski read their [[spec script]] and was hired to direct and rewrite the script in March the following year. The film drew inspiration from other films, such as ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', ''[[No Country for Old Men (film)|No Country for Old Men]]'', and ''[[In the Bedroom]]''. Krasinski and Blunt were cast in the lead roles in May 2017. Filming took place in [[upstate New York]] from May to November 2017.\n\n''A Quiet Place'' premiered at [[South by Southwest]] on March 9, 2018, and was released in the United States on April 6, 2018, by [[Paramount Pictures]]. It became a major box office success, grossing over $340 million worldwide, and received critical acclaim for its atmosphere, direction, acting, and sound design. It was described as a \"smart, wickedly frightening good time\",<ref>{{cite web |url=https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/a-quiet-place-and-blockers-are-certified-fresh/ |title='A Quiet Place' and 'Blockers' Are Certified Fresh |first=Jeff |last=Giles |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |date=April 5, 2018 |accessdate=April 5, 2018}}</ref> and chosen by both the [[National Board of Review Awards 2018#Top 10 Films|National Board of Review]] and [[American Film Institute Awards 2018#Top 10 Films|American Film Institute]] as one of the top ten films of 2018.\n\nThe film received several award nominations, including a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score]], [[Producers Guild of America Award for Best Theatrical Motion Picture]], [[Writers Guild of America Award for Best Original Screenplay]], and [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role]] for Blunt, which she later won. It was also nominated for a [[BAFTA Award for Best Sound]] at the [[72nd British Academy Film Awards|72nd BAFTA Awards]] as well for a [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing]] at the [[91st Academy Awards]].\n\nA sequel, ''[[A Quiet Place Part II]]'', is scheduled to be released in 2020, with Krasinski again directing and the main cast also returning.\n\n==Plot==\nThroughout the year 2020, most of Earth's human and animal populations have been annihilated by sightless extraterrestrial creatures. The creatures, which attack anything that makes noise, have hypersensitive hearing and indestructible, armored skin.\n\nThe Abbott family{{spnd}}wife Evelyn, husband Lee, congenitally deaf daughter Regan, and sons Marcus and Beau{{spnd}}silently scavenge for supplies in a deserted town. Going barefoot while out in the open, the family communicates in [[American Sign Language]]. Four-year-old Beau is drawn to a battery-powered space shuttle toy, but Lee takes it away due to the noise it would make. Regan returns the toy to Beau, who also takes the batteries that his father removed from it. Beau activates the toy when the family is walking home while crossing a bridge, giving away his location to a nearby creature that kills him before Lee can save him.\n\n[[File:House used as the Abbott family home in A Quiet Place.jpg|thumb|right|The house used as the Abbotts' in the film|alt=A white wooden three-story house with a scaled mansard roof, lit by the sun from the left, viewed at a three-quarters angle amid a landscape with wooded hills in the background under a clear blue sky]]\nOver a year later, Regan struggles with guilt over her brother's death, Evelyn enters the final stages of pregnancy, and Lee fruitlessly tries to make radio contact with the outside world. Lee attempts to upgrade Regan's [[cochlear implant]] with scavenged miniature amplifiers to restore her hearing, but the devices are ineffective. Later, Lee takes Marcus to a nearby river with a large waterfall to teach him how to fish, while Regan abandons her mother to visit Beau's memorial. Lee explains to Marcus that they are safe from the creatures in the presence of louder and constant sounds, as the sounds mask over their voices and do not attract creatures. Marcus then reveals that Regan blames herself for Beau's death and needs her father to tell her he still loves her.\n\nAlone at the house, Evelyn goes into labor. While making her way to their basement, she accidentally steps on an exposed nail with her right foot. In pain, Evelyn accidentally drops a glass picture frame and alerts a nearby creature. Evelyn flips a switch that changes the exterior house lights to red as a danger signal to the others and struggles to remain silent during her [[uterine contraction|contractions]].\n\nArriving at the farm and seeing the lights, Lee instructs Marcus to set off fireworks as a diversion. Arriving at the house, Lee finds Evelyn hiding in the bathroom with their newborn son and, along with Evelyn, makes his way to their improvised soundproofed basement. Lee leaves to find the other children, promising Evelyn he will protect them. Evelyn then falls asleep but soon wakes to discover that the barn basement is flooded with water from a broken pipe and that a creature has found its way inside the basement hideaway.\n\nRegan, hurrying back to the farm, takes refuge atop a [[grain silo]] with Marcus, lighting a fire to alert their father of their whereabouts. However, they run out of lighter fluid and the fire dies before they can attract Lee's attention. A hatch door then suddenly gives way, and Marcus falls into the silo. The sound of the door falling distracts the creature that was stalking Evelyn and it targets Marcus and Regan. \n\nRegan, who has jumped in after Marcus, [[grain entrapment|sinks into the corn and nearly suffocates]], but Marcus saves her. Regan's cochlear implant reacts to the proximity of the creature by emitting a high-frequency sound that drives it away. The children proceed to escape from the silo and reunite with their father.\n\nThe creature returns, attacking and wounding Lee, while Marcus and Regan hide in a pickup truck. After seeing his father wounded, Marcus shouts impulsively, attracting the creature to the truck. Lee signs to Regan that he loves her and always has, before yelling to draw the creature away from his children; the creature, hearing Lee's voice, attacks and kills him. Regan and Marcus roll the truck down a hill to escape and reunite with Evelyn and the baby at the farmhouse.\n\nThe four retreat to the house's basement.<ref name=METRO2 /> When the creature returns, Regan, who realizes that the sound made by the implant distresses the creature,<ref name=METRO2 /> switches the device back on and places it on a nearby microphone, amplifying the [[audio feedback|feedback]]. Painfully disoriented, the creature exposes the flesh beneath its armored head, allowing Evelyn to fatally shoot it with a [[shotgun]]. The family views a [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] monitor, showing two creatures attracted by the noise of the shotgun blast approaching the house. With their newly acquired knowledge of the creatures' weakness, the members of the family arm themselves and prepare to fight back.<ref name=METRO2>{{cite news |last=Wakeman |first=Gregory |url=https://www.metro.us/entertainment/movies/a-quiet-place-ending |title='A Quiet Place' has one of the coolest movie endings ever |work=[[Metro (U.S. newspaper)|Metro]] |date=April 5, 2018 |accessdate=July 26, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[John Krasinski]] as Lee Abbott, an engineer, husband of Evelyn, and the father of Regan, Marcus, Beau, and baby Abbott.

Written by [[Bryan Woods]], [[Scott Beck]] and Krasinski, the plot revolves around a father (Krasinski) and a mother ([[Emily Blunt]]) who struggle to survive and raise their children in a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] world inhabited by blind [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] creatures with an acute sense of hearing.\n\nBeck and Woods had begun developing a story that would lead into the film at college. In July 2016, Krasinski read their [[spec script]] and was hired to direct and rewrite the script in March the following year. The film drew inspiration from other films, such as ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', ''[[No Country for Old Men (film)|No Country for Old Men]]'', and ''[[In the Bedroom]]''. Krasinski and Blunt were cast in the lead roles in May 2017. Filming took place in [[upstate New York]] from May to November 2017.\n\n''A Quiet Place'' premiered at [[South by Southwest]] on March 9, 2018, and was released in the United States on April 6, 2018, by [[Paramount Pictures]]. It became a major box office success, grossing over $340 million worldwide, and received critical acclaim for its atmosphere, direction, acting, and sound design. It was described as a \"smart, wickedly frightening good time\",<ref>{{cite web |url=https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/a-quiet-place-and-blockers-are-certified-fresh/ |title='A Quiet Place' and 'Blockers' Are Certified Fresh |first=Jeff |last=Giles |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |date=April 5, 2018 |accessdate=April 5, 2018}}</ref> and chosen by both the [[National Board of Review Awards 2018#Top 10 Films|National Board of Review]] and [[American Film Institute Awards 2018#Top 10 Films|American Film Institute]] as one of the top ten films of 2018.\n\nThe film received several award nominations, including a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score]], [[Producers Guild of America Award for Best Theatrical Motion Picture]], [[Writers Guild of America Award for Best Original Screenplay]], and [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role]] for Blunt, which she later won. It was also nominated for a [[BAFTA Award for Best Sound]] at the [[72nd British Academy Film Awards|72nd BAFTA Awards]] as well for a [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing]] at the [[91st Academy Awards]].\n\nA sequel, ''[[A Quiet Place Part II]]'', is scheduled to be released in 2020, with Krasinski again directing and the main cast also returning.\n\n==Plot==\nThroughout the year 2020, most of Earth's human and animal populations have been annihilated by sightless extraterrestrial creatures. The creatures, which attack anything that makes noise, have hypersensitive hearing and indestructible, armored skin.\n\nThe Abbott family{{spnd}}wife Evelyn, husband Lee, congenitally deaf daughter Regan, and sons Marcus and Beau{{spnd}}silently scavenge for supplies in a deserted town. Going barefoot while out in the open, the family communicates through [[American Sign Language]]. \n\nFour-year-old Beau is drawn to a battery-powered space shuttle toy, but Lee takes it away due to the noise it would make. Regan returns the toy to Beau, who also takes the batteries that his father removed from it. Beau activates the toy when the family is walking home while crossing a bridge, giving away his location to a nearby creature that kills him before Lee can save him.\n\n[[File:House used as the Abbott family home in A Quiet Place.jpg|thumb|right|The house used as the Abbotts' in the film|alt=A white wooden three-story house with a scaled mansard roof, lit by the sun from the left, viewed at a three-quarters angle amid a landscape with wooded hills in the background under a clear blue sky]]\nOver a year later, Regan struggles with guilt over her brother's death, Evelyn enters the final stages of pregnancy, and Lee fruitlessly tries to make radio contact with the outside world. Lee attempts to upgrade Regan's [[cochlear implant]] with scavenged miniature amplifiers to restore her hearing, but the devices are ineffective. Later, Lee takes Marcus to a nearby river with a large waterfall to teach him how to fish, while Regan abandons her mother to visit Beau's memorial. Lee explains to Marcus that they are safe from the creatures in the presence of louder and constant sounds, as the sounds mask over their voices and do not attract creatures. Marcus then reveals that Regan blames herself for Beau's death and needs her father to tell her he still loves her.\n\nAlone at the house, Evelyn goes into labor. While making her way to their basement, she accidentally steps on an exposed nail with her right foot. In pain, Evelyn accidentally drops a glass picture frame and alerts a nearby creature. Evelyn flips a switch that changes the exterior house lights to red as a danger signal to the others and struggles to remain silent during her [[uterine contraction|contractions]].\n\nArriving at the farm and seeing the lights, Lee instructs Marcus to set off fireworks as a diversion. Arriving at the house, Lee finds Evelyn hiding in the bathroom with their newborn son and, along with Evelyn, makes his way to their improvised soundproofed basement. Lee leaves to find the other children, promising Evelyn he will protect them. Evelyn then falls asleep but soon wakes to discover that the barn basement is flooded with water from a broken pipe and that a creature has found its way inside the basement hideaway.\n\nRegan, hurrying back to the farm, takes refuge atop a [[grain silo]] with Marcus, lighting a fire to alert their father of their whereabouts. However, they run out of lighter fluid and the fire dies before they can attract Lee's attention. A hatch door then suddenly gives way, and Marcus falls into the silo. The sound of the door falling distracts the creature that was stalking Evelyn and it targets Marcus and Regan. \n\nRegan, who has jumped in after Marcus, [[grain entrapment|sinks into the corn and nearly suffocates]], but Marcus saves her. Regan's cochlear implant reacts to the proximity of the creature by emitting a high-frequency sound that drives it away. The children proceed to escape from the silo and reunite with their father.\n\nThe creature returns, attacking and wounding Lee, while Marcus and Regan hide in a pickup truck. After seeing his father wounded, Marcus shouts impulsively, attracting the creature to the truck. Lee signs to Regan that he loves her and always has, before yelling to draw the creature away from his children; the creature, hearing Lee's voice, attacks and kills him. Regan and Marcus roll the truck down a hill to escape and reunite with Evelyn and the baby at the farmhouse.\n\nThe four retreat to the house's basement.<ref name=METRO2 /> When the creature returns, Regan, who realizes that the sound made by the implant distresses the creature,<ref name=METRO2 /> switches the device back on and places it on a nearby microphone, amplifying the [[audio feedback|feedback]]. Painfully disoriented, the creature exposes the flesh beneath its armored head, allowing Evelyn to fatally shoot it with a [[shotgun]]. The family views a [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] monitor, showing two creatures attracted by the noise of the shotgun blast approaching the house. With their newly acquired knowledge of the creatures' weakness, the members of the family arm themselves and prepare to fight back.<ref name=METRO2>{{cite news |last=Wakeman |first=Gregory |url=https://www.metro.us/entertainment/movies/a-quiet-place-ending |title='A Quiet Place' has one of the coolest movie endings ever |work=[[Metro (U.S. newspaper)|Metro]] |date=April 5, 2018 |accessdate=July 26, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[John Krasinski]] as Lee Abbott, an engineer, husband of Evelyn, and the father of Regan, Marcus, Beau, and baby Abbott.

For scenes from the perspective of the deaf daughter, sound was removed to put greater focus on the visual. They also advised on organizing shots to reflect the creatures' perspective, like showing them noticing a sound, then showing what was causing the sound. Composer [[Marco Beltrami]] provided the sound editors music to work with in a way that would not interfere with the sound design throughout the film.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=James |first=Daron |url=https://variety.com/2018/artisans/production/quiet-place-sound-1202743919/ |title='A Quiet Place' Leans on Sound Team to Deliver Maximum Chills |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=April 5, 2018 |accessdate=April 6, 2018 }}</ref>\n\nIn the film, creatures are blind and communicate through clicking sounds.

The director wanted the creatures to look like they had evolved to no longer need eyes, and to be \"somewhat humanoid\" in nature.

Isolda's great uncle was the Seneschal and [[High Sheriff of Cornwall]], Sir Stephen Haym, one of the founding [[Canon (priest)|canons]] of [[Glasney College]].\n\nWhen his father died Henry was still under aged and his [[wardship]] went to Sir William de Alneto. On 19 May 1277 Henry's wardship was purchased by his uncle, [[William Bodrugan (priest)|William Bodrugan]], later Provost of [[Glasney College|Glasney]], and [[Archdeacon of Cornwall]]. Henry became the heir of both his uncle, William, and his great uncle, Reginald.\n\nIn 1287 he married Sybil de Mandeville (29 September 1264\u2013c.1307) daughter of an unknown Mandeville and his wife Alice Giffard. Sybil's grandparents were Hugh Giffard and Sibyl, daughter and co-heiress of Walter de Cormeilles. From 1239 until his death in 1246 Hugh was responsible for raising the young prince, later King, [[Edward I of England|Edward I]]. Sybil's maternal uncles were the [[Lord Chancellor]]s of England, [[Walter Giffard]], [[Archbishop of York]], and [[Godfrey Giffard]], [[Bishop of Worcester]]. Her aunt Mabel was the Abbess of [[Shaftesbury Abbey]]. Sybil was the widow of Peter le Poer (d. 4 April 1283), likely related to Eustace le Poer who, together with Thomas de Mandeville, brought an army from Ireland to Scotland to fight for Edward I of England. Sybil was [[Lady of the Bedchamber|lady of the Queen's chamber]] to [[Eleanor of Castile]] and her children were still with the Queen's children in 1289\u201390. She was buried in Glasney College and her son Sir Otto paid for the Bodrugan Chantry to be built there in his parents' honour.\n\nHenry and Sybil had two children:\n*[[Otto Bodrugan (died 1331)|Otto]], married Margaret Champernowne (d. 1360).\n*Joan (b. 1285), married Sir Henry Champernowne.\nThese children and their spouses feature heavily in the novel [[The House on the Strand]] by [[Daphne du Maurier]].\n\n== Landowner ==\nHis principal residence appears to have been at [[Bodrugan Barton|Bodrugan]], near [[St Goran|Goran]], with others at [[Looe|Pendrym]] and [[Tregrehan House|Tregrehan]]. At his death he owned the manors of Bodrugan, Pendrym, Trethem, Tretheak, Treworrick, Tremodret, Trevellion, Tregrehan, Trethew and Lantyan Parva. The large manor of [[Restronguet (manor)|Restronguet]] was held by his mother, who did not die until 1311. Henry had already given away the manor of [[Barcelona, Cornwall|Trelawne]] to his daughter on her marriage. The manor of Markwell, which belonged to his uncle William, was given to William's illegitimate daughter, but eventually returned to Henry's son Otto. In addition to these manors he held other lands and tenements across Cornwall.\n\nHe held some property in Ireland through his wife who was named heir to her brother Walter in 1288. The Mandevilles were important sub-tenants of the earldom of Ulster and, between 1300 and 1304, Edward I issued numerous letters of nomination for Henry's attorneys in Ireland (his brothers John and Peter, and John le Fugheler). In 1305 John le Poer, baron of Doneyl in [[Waterford, Ireland|Waterford]], and Sibyl's son by her first marriage, was found owing Henry \u00a3200. The sheriff of Waterford was commanded by the king to levy \u00a350 of the lands and chattels of John le Poer of the \u00a3200. Through her brother he also came to hold 1/6 of the manor of [[Luton]], [[Bedfordshire]] which Walter had exchanged for portions of the manors of [[Eltham]], [[Woolwich]] and [[Mottingham]]. When Sybil died these Mandeville estates passed to her son by her first marriage.\n\n== Political career ==\nHe was a [[Member of Parliament|Member]] (MP) of the [[Parliament of England]] for [[Cornwall (UK Parliament constituency)|Cornwall]] in 1307. In 1284 he was one of the [[Justices of Assize]] for Cornwall, and in 1302 he was a juror at the assizes. In 1309, months after his death, he was summoned to parliament as a [[Hereditary peer|baron]]. As he could not sit in that parliament his descendants were unable to claim the title of baron.\n\n== Military career ==\nIn 1286 Henry joined [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] on an expedition to [[Gascony]]. In April he was given permission to go \"beyond the seas\" for one year with [[Robert Burnell]], Bishop of Bath and Wells, [[Edmund Crouchback]] and others. After sailing to northern France in mid-May they reached Gascony by August. Henry was knighted by 1289, perhaps as a result of his participation in the expedition. As there is no record of him serving in Wales, he was probably part of the 1294 expedition to Gascony with [[John of Brittany, Earl of Richmond|John of Brittany]] and [[William Latimer, 1st Baron Latimer|William Latymer]]. From 1300 Henry became involved in Edward's Scottish wars, his coat of arms is features as No. 227 in the [[List of rolls of arms#14th century rolls|Galloway Roll]]. In September 1302 the king issued a pardon to Henry's retinue, his younger brothers Peter and John, Adam de Markwell (married to Henry's uncle's illegitimate daughter), Serlo Wyse and John le Fugheler for crimes they had committed \"in consideration of their service in Gascony and Scotland\". The crimes were the retaliatory measures the men had taken after Henry was attacked by Thomas Lercedekne and Ralph de Bloyou at the house of William Bloyou at Glasney.\n\n==References==\n{{Portal|Cornwall}}\n* Whetter, Dr James, The Bodrugans, A Study of a Cornish Medieval Knightly Family, Lyfrow Trelyspen, 1995\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bodrugan, Henry}}\n[[Category:13th-century births]]\n[[Category:14th-century deaths]]\n[[Category:Politicians from Cornwall]]\n[[Category:Members of the pre-1707 English Parliament for constituencies in Cornwall]]\n[[Category:13th-century English people]]\n[[Category:English MPs 1307]]\n[[Category:13th-century soldiers]]\n[[Category:Bodrugan family|Henry]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2017}}\n{{Use British English|date=October 2017}}\n[[File:BodruganArms.png|thumb|right|Arms of Bodrugan, ''Argent, three bendlets gules'']]\n'''Sir Henry de Bodrugan''' (c.1263\u20131308) was a [[Cornish people|Cornish]] landowner, knight and politician.\n\n== Family ==\nBodrugan was the son and heir of Sir Roger de Bodrugan (d. 1277) by Isolda (d.1311), later wife of Sir Henry de Pomeroy (d. 1281) and Sir Walter de Aylesbury, daughter of Symon de Pyn.

In September 1302 the king issued a pardon to Henry's retinue, his younger brothers Peter and John, Adam de Markwell (married to Henry's uncle's illegitimate daughter), Serlo Wyse and John le Fugheler for crimes they had committed \"in consideration of their service in Gascony and Scotland\". The crimes were the retaliatory measures the men had taken after Henry was attacked by Thomas Lercedekne and Ralph de Bloyou at the house of William Bloyou at Glasney.\n\n==References==\n{{Portal|Cornwall}}\n* Whetter, Dr James, The Bodrugans, A Study of a Cornish Medieval Knightly Family, Lyfrow Trelyspen, 1995\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bodrugan, Henry}}\n[[Category:13th-century births]]\n[[Category:14th-century deaths]]\n[[Category:Politicians from Cornwall]]\n[[Category:Members of the pre-1707 English Parliament for constituencies in Cornwall]]\n[[Category:13th-century English people]]\n[[Category:English MPs 1307]]\n[[Category:13th-century soldiers]]\n[[Category:Bodrugan family|Henry]]\n", "name_user": "J947", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eFamily:dash", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Bodrugan"}

Born in Germany, he is currently serving a prison sentence in California. In his late teens, Gerhartsreiter moved to the US, where he lived under a succession of [[Pseudonym|aliases]] while variously claiming to be an actor, director, art collector, a physicist, a ship's captain, a negotiator of international debt agreements, and an English aristocrat.\n\nIn 1995 while using the assumed identity \"Clark Rockefeller,\" claiming to be part of the noted [[Rockefeller family]], he married a successful businesswoman, Sandra Boss. They had a daughter together. Gerhartsreiter lived well solely on his wife's income. She became dissatisfied with his secretive, [[controlling behavior]] and sought a [[divorce]]. Inquiries on her behalf revealed that he had fabricated his name and his family background. The couple divorced and Gerhartsreiter agreed to accept limited access to his daughter on supervised visits. Gerhartsreiter was arrested on August 2, 2008, six days after he abducted his daughter while she was on a visit. He was subsequently convicted of the [[Parental child abduction|custodial kidnapping]] of his daughter.\n\nIn addition to Clark Rockefeller, Gerhartsreiter's aliases include Chris C. Crowe, Chris Chichester, and Chip Smith. Gerhartsreiter's true identity was revealed after author [[Edward Savio]] -- with whom Gerhartsreiter briefly lived upon arriving in the United States -- contacted the FBI during the manhunt after seeing a photo of \"Clark Rockefeller\" on the news.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2008-aug-09-me-sanmarino9-story.html|title=Many possible aliases probed in cold case|work= [[Los Angeles Times]]|date=August 9, 2008|accessdate=June 9, 2019|first1=Richard|last1=Winton|first2=Carla|last2=Hall|first3= Molly|last3=Hennessy-Fiske}}</ref> Police had been seeking Gerhartsreiter since 1985 as a suspect in the disappearance of a married couple in California.

He later used their names to obtain permission to enter the US, falsely declaring that the Kellns had invited him to stay with them in California. After entering the US at New York, he went to [[Berlin, Connecticut]], where he found a family (the family of author [[Edward Savio]]) willing to let him live with them. In 1979 he was accepted as a foreign exchange student at Berlin High School. He told the Savios that he was from a wealthy family in Germany.

Gerhartsreiter/Chichester was initially identified as a \"[[person of interest]]\" by police in the 1985 disappearance and possible murder of Jonathan Sohus, whose wife, Linda, was also missing. Gerhartsreiter reportedly told people that Jonathan and Linda Sohus had traveled to [[Europe]]. Their family reportedly received a postcard from the couple sent from [[France]] after Jonathan and Linda Sohus had disappeared, though its authenticity has been questioned.\n\nBy the late 1980s, Gerhartsreiter had relocated to the East Coast. Police pulled him over in [[Greenwich, Connecticut]]. He was driving a pickup truck that had belonged to Jonathan Sohus, but he left the area before police could interview him. At that point, police had no proof that Jonathan and Linda Sohus were dead, nor that they'd left California voluntarily.\n\nIn 1994, bones believed to belong to Jonathan Sohus were found buried in the back yard of the home he had lived in with his wife (adjacent to the guesthouse used by Gerhartsreiter). Sohus's family members said the bones matched Jonathan Sohus's general description. Since he had been adopted, there was no way to compare his [[DNA]] against that of biological family members and arrive at a conclusive identity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1A1-D92HOAS00.html |title=DNA tests underway on bones in Rockefeller case |first=Thomas|last=Watkins|agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=August 14, 2008 |archivedate=March 18, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100318064717/http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1A1-D92HOAS00.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> Forensic evidence showed that the victim had been struck in the head two times with a rounded, blunt object and then stabbed six times.

Christopher Crowe is the name of one of the producers of the series.<ref name=vanity/>\n\nHe was hired by the [[brokerage firm]] S.N. Phelps and Company to work with the firm's computers.

She had graduated from [[Stanford University]] and [[Harvard Business School]]. They had a [[Quaker]] ceremony that had no legal status.<ref name=vanity/> Boss later testified that Gerhartsreiter was charming and that she believed the stories he told her at the beginning of their relationship. Later, however, he became emotionally abusive, and there was a \"lot of anger and yelling\" in their household. Although Boss earned all of the family income, she testified that Gerhartsreiter held complete control of the family's finances and other aspects of her day-to-day life.\n\nGerhartsreiter went to great lengths to conceal his true identity from his wife. He repeatedly told her she should file her tax return as a single person. Later in their marriage, when his wife's firm required that a certified public accountant do her taxes, he found an accountant for her. After their divorce, Boss learned that he had told their accountant he was her brother so that the accountant would continue filing single tax returns for her.<ref name=bostonnews>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2009/03/13/rockefeller_seeks_dismissal_of_false_name_charge|title='Rockefeller' seeks dismissal of false name charge|work= [[Boston Globe]]|date= March 13, 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe couple had a daughter, born in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/unmasking-con-man-and-rockefeller-imposter-christian-gerhartsreiter/|title=AKA Rockefeller|author=Erin Moriarty|date=March 22, 2014|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=November 20, 2014}}</ref> Gerhartsreiter lived with Boss and their child in [[Cornish, New Hampshire]], where he used his supposed family ties to bolster his reputation, telling friends and neighbors that he was a wealthy [[Yale University|Yale]] graduate who owned a business in Canada.<ref name=vanity/> Under the name Clark Rockefeller, he had gained membership to Boston's [[Algonquin Club]], where he spent a great deal of time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/blog/2008/08/14/money-talks-2 |title=Money Talks|publisher=[[Boston (magazine)|Boston Magazine]]|date= August 14, 2008|accessdate=June 9, 2019|first=Francis|last=Storrs}}</ref> He resigned as one of the club's directors in April 2008.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070715130514/http://www.algonquinclub.com/board.htm Archived Algonquin Club website]</ref>\n\nBoss hired a private investigator in 2006 and discovered that Gerhartsreiter was not who he claimed to be, though she did not learn his real name at that time.

Born in Germany, he is currently serving a prison sentence in California. In his late teens, Gerhartsreiter moved to the US, where he lived under a succession of [[Pseudonym|aliases]] while variously claiming to be an actor, director, art collector, a physicist, a ship's captain, a negotiator of international debt agreements, and an English aristocrat.\n\nIn 1995 while using the assumed identity \"Clark Rockefeller,\" claiming to be part of the noted [[Rockefeller family]], he married a successful businesswoman, Sandra Boss. They had a daughter together. Gerhartsreiter lived well solely on his wife's income. She became dissatisfied with his secretive, [[controlling behavior]] and sought a [[divorce]]. Inquiries on her behalf revealed that he had fabricated his name and his family background. The couple divorced and Gerhartsreiter agreed to accept limited access to his daughter on supervised visits. Gerhartsreiter was arrested on August 2, 2008, six days after he abducted his daughter while she was on a visit. He was subsequently convicted of the [[Parental child abduction|custodial kidnapping]] of his daughter.\n\nIn addition to Clark Rockefeller, Gerhartsreiter's aliases include Chris C. Crowe, Chris Chichester, and Chip Smith. Gerhartsreiter's true identity was revealed after author [[Edward Savio]] -- with whom Gerhartsreiter briefly lived upon arriving in the United States -- contacted the FBI during the manhunt after seeing a photo of \"Clark Rockefeller\" on the news.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2008-aug-09-me-sanmarino9-story.html|title=Many possible aliases probed in cold case|work= [[Los Angeles Times]]|date=August 9, 2008|accessdate=June 9, 2019|first1=Richard|last1=Winton|first2=Carla|last2=Hall|first3= Molly|last3=Hennessy-Fiske}}</ref> Police had been seeking Gerhartsreiter since 1985 as a suspect in the disappearance of a married couple in California.

He later used their names to obtain permission to enter the US, falsely declaring that the Kellns had invited him to stay with them in California. After entering the US at New York, he went to [[Berlin, Connecticut]], where he found a family (the family of author [[Edward Savio]]) willing to let him live with them. In 1979 he was accepted as a foreign exchange student at Berlin High School. He told the Savios that he was from a wealthy family in Germany. Eventually he wore out his welcome with the Savios and was told to leave.<ref name=vanity>{{cite news|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2009/01/fake_rockefeller200901|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|title=The Man in the Rockefeller Suit| first=Mark|last=Seal|date=December 3, 2008|accessdate=June 9, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==First marriage==\nGerhartsreiter had intended to become an actor in the United States and decided to go on to California to pursue that career. By the time he reached [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], he had started calling himself \"Christopher Kenneth Gerhart.\" While there, he enrolled in a class at the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Milwaukee]].

Gerhartsreiter/Chichester was initially identified as a \"[[person of interest]]\" by police in the 1985 disappearance and possible murder of Jonathan Sohus, whose wife, Linda, was also missing. Gerhartsreiter reportedly told people that Jonathan and Linda Sohus had traveled to [[Europe]]. Their family reportedly received a postcard from the couple sent from [[France]] after Jonathan and Linda Sohus had disappeared, though its authenticity has been questioned.\n\nBy the late 1980s, Gerhartsreiter had relocated to the East Coast. Police pulled him over in [[Greenwich, Connecticut]]. He was driving a pickup truck that had belonged to Jonathan Sohus, but he left the area before police could interview him. At that point, police had no proof that Jonathan and Linda Sohus were dead, nor that they'd left California voluntarily.\n\nIn 1994, bones believed to belong to Jonathan Sohus were found buried in the back yard of the home he had lived in with his wife (adjacent to the guesthouse used by Gerhartsreiter). Sohus's family members said the bones matched Jonathan Sohus's general description. Since he had been adopted, there was no way to compare his [[DNA]] against that of biological family members and arrive at a conclusive identity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1A1-D92HOAS00.html |title=DNA tests underway on bones in Rockefeller case |first=Thomas|last=Watkins|agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=August 14, 2008 |archivedate=March 18, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100318064717/http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1A1-D92HOAS00.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> Forensic evidence showed that the victim had been struck in the head two times with a rounded, blunt object and then stabbed six times.

Crowe.\" He claimed to be a television producer from [[Los Angeles]] who worked on the 1980s remake of [[Alfred Hitchcock Presents (1985 TV series)|''Alfred Hitchcock Presents'']]. Christopher Crowe is the name of one of the producers of the series.<ref name=vanity/>\n\nHe was hired by the [[brokerage firm]] S.N. Phelps and Company to work with the firm's computers. He was fired when it was discovered that the [[social security number]] he had given them belonged to serial killer [[David Berkowitz]]. He was employed by [[Nikko Cordial|Nikko Securities Ltd.]] as a sales manager of [[corporate bonds]] until he was fired. He briefly worked for [[Kidder, Peabody & Co.]], but quit his job and abandoned the Christopher Crowe persona when he discovered that police were looking for him in connection with the disappearance of John and Linda Sohus.<ref name=vanity/>\n\n===Clark Rockefeller===\nIn 1995, using the name \"James Frederick Mills Clark Rockefeller,\" Gerhartsreiter married Sandra Boss, a high-earning [[McKinsey & Company|McKinsey]] senior executive. She had graduated from [[Stanford University]] and [[Harvard Business School]]. They had a [[Quaker]] ceremony that had no legal status.<ref name=vanity/> Boss later testified that Gerhartsreiter was charming and that she believed the stories he told her at the beginning of their relationship. Later, however, he became emotionally abusive, and there was a \"lot of anger and yelling\" in their household. Although Boss earned all of the family income, she testified that Gerhartsreiter held complete control of the family's finances and other aspects of her day-to-day life.\n\nGerhartsreiter went to great lengths to conceal his true identity from his wife. He repeatedly told her she should file her tax return as a single person. Later in their marriage, when his wife's firm required that a certified public accountant do her taxes, he found an accountant for her. After their divorce, Boss learned that he had told their accountant he was her brother so that the accountant would continue filing single tax returns for her.<ref name=bostonnews>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2009/03/13/rockefeller_seeks_dismissal_of_false_name_charge|title='Rockefeller' seeks dismissal of false name charge|work= [[Boston Globe]]|date= March 13, 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe couple had a daughter, born in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/unmasking-con-man-and-rockefeller-imposter-christian-gerhartsreiter/|title=AKA Rockefeller|author=Erin Moriarty|date=March 22, 2014|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=November 20, 2014}}</ref> Gerhartsreiter lived with Boss and their child in [[Cornish, New Hampshire]], where he used his supposed family ties to bolster his reputation, telling friends and neighbors that he was a wealthy [[Yale University|Yale]] graduate who owned a business in Canada.<ref name=vanity/> Under the name Clark Rockefeller, he had gained membership to Boston's [[Algonquin Club]], where he spent a great deal of time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/blog/2008/08/14/money-talks-2 |title=Money Talks|publisher=[[Boston (magazine)|Boston Magazine]]|date= August 14, 2008|accessdate=June 9, 2019|first=Francis|last=Storrs}}</ref> He resigned as one of the club's directors in April 2008.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070715130514/http://www.algonquinclub.com/board.htm Archived Algonquin Club website]</ref>\n\nBoss hired a private investigator in 2006 and discovered that Gerhartsreiter was not who he claimed to be, though she did not learn his real name at that time.
