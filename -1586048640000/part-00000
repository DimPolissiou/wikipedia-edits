In response to the additional dates, [[Joey Fatone]] stated, <blockquote>\"We\u2019re real excited about that. But I think we\u2019re just going to do a great show again. You know, a lot of people have seen some of the show. But you know, every show that we do is different. We add little things here and there to change it up and make it an original show, so hopefully everybody will enjoy it\"</blockquote>\n\nThe band also announced they would join [[Britney Spears]] on a co-headlining tour of Europe in October.<ref name=\"yahooB\"/> However, the tour was dropped due to legal actions and Spears toured the region solo. As the second North American leg came to a close, the band announced they would star in their first feature [[concert film]]. The film was released exclusively through [[IMAX]] theaters for six months. Additionally, the band partnered with [[MSN]] to give fans exclusive access to newsletters, photos and video footage. Known as \"NSYNC@MSN\", the service provided web and email access along with [[Windows Live Messenger|MSN Messenger]] and [[Windows Media Player]].\n\n===Concert synopsis===\nThe show began NSYNC revealed as marionettes dropping 40 feet above the stage featuring a small sample of ''[[I Got No Strings]]''. When they land, the group cuts the strings and unhooked themselves before heading into two dance-oriented performances of ''No Strings Attached'' and ''[[I Want You Back (NSYNC song)|I Want You Back]]''. This was followed by Lance Bass welcoming the crowd before slowing things down with a performance of ''[[(God Must Have Spent) A Little More Time on You]]'' which the group rose 30 feet above the stage on 5 small platforms.\n\nAfter the group left the stage, there was a video interlude hosted by television persona [[Ananda Lewis]] called ''Total *NSYNC Live'' (parody of ''[[Total Request Live]]'') which fans were given 4 selections of possible songs that *NSYNC would sing next. The first 3-song choices (''[[Yankee Doodle Dandy]]'', ''[[Three Blind Mice]]'', and ''[[Twinkle Twinkle Little Star]]'') always ended up getting jeers and a laugh from the crowd. By the time Lewis says the 4th option ''[[Tearin' Up My Heart]]'', the crowd goes wild, it gets selected as the chosen song, and the group returns to the stage dressed in freestyle clothing (almost like their previous wardrobe from their last tour) to perform the song.\n\nThe show then continues with Justin Timberlake returning the stage showcasing some his freestyle [[Beatbox]] skills before the group's drummer begins to upstage him and calling him out, Timberlake challenges the drummer to a battle which ends in victory for Timberlake. The rest of the group returns to the stage in urban attire to perform ''[[It's Gonna Be Me]]''. This was followed by the group putting together a living room setting to slow things down again with 2 ballads ''[[I Drive Myself Crazy]]'' and ''I Thought She Knew''.\n\nAfter the group leaves the stage again, another interlude is shown featuring the group heading into their quick change room featuring circus people, an arcade, and a movie Theatre. They then returns to the stage dressed in club attire all designed with money on it for a performance of \"[[Just Got Paid (Johnny Kemp song)|Just Got Paid]]\". During the song, pre-selected fans were chosen to go up on stage and dance with the group with confetti dropping everywhere. They also introduce their band members before all leaving the stage again.\n\nThe show continues with a futuristic interlude which included a laser lightshow and the face of the ''No Strings Attached'' clown mascot (with a robot voice) appearing out of a virtual head giving the audience riddles. NSYNC then rises out of the floor dressed in mid western futuristic attire for a performance of ''Space Cowboy'' featuring an extended dance break. At the end of the song, the group goes back down into the ground with the band playing an extended instrumental interlude of the chorus. It ends abruptly with the sound of a car crashing, a woman screaming, a man yelling \"Someone's hurt\", and the sound of an ambulance siren. NSYNC returns to the stage in a little brief hospital skit dressed in doctor lab coats taking care of an injured Timberlake before heading into ''It Makes Me Ill''. This was followed by the group bringing out stools to slow things down for another song. However, Chasez comes up with an idea to go more closer to the crowd. The group brings out the stools before the center piece of the stage breaks. The stage piece (on a track) brings the members out to the center of the arena getting closer to the crowd ending the main set list with ''[[This I Promise You]]''. The stage piece goes back to where it was, the group takes their bows, and leaves the stage.\nThe show continues with a large video screen that says \"*NSYNC\" appeared on the set while the band dressed on a futuristic space with Digital Get Down while NSYNC disappeared on a video screen wall and then we concludes the encore set with ''[[Bye Bye Bye]]'', As the guys walks over the platform stage, they say goodbye and walks over the main stage while JC walks over and introduced to the musicians. The group then disappears through a geyser as fireworks go off at the same time.\n\n===Occurrences===\nDespite the success of the tour, it faced a few bumps in the road. The bands were targets for an assassination by a male teenager. The mother of the [[Hendersonville, Tennessee]], teenager discovered a notebook that contained a detailed plan to kill all five members of the band during their show in Atlanta. The plan (called \"Operation Deathstrike\") featured the teen robbing a local gun store to obtain the weapons and money to carry out his plan. The mother informed the local authorities and the teen was detained at the [[Sumner County, Tennessee|Sumner County Juvenile Detention Center]]. Although the authorities felt the teen had no true intentions of executing his plan, he was later admitted to a [[psychiatric hospital]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/n-syncs-would-be-assassins-plot-foiled-20001020 |title=N Sync's Would-Be Assassin's Plot Foiled |author=Saraceno, Christina |date=20 October 2000 |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=25 August 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61DIwAz8U?url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/n-syncs-would-be-assassins-plot-foiled-20001020 |archivedate=26 August 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> Extra security precautions were taken during both of the [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] shows.\n\nBefore performing in [[Joliet, Illinois]], the stage was destroyed by a [[tornado]] at the [[Route 66 Raceway]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,85318,00.html |title=Copy, Right? |author=Reese, Lori |date=28 June 2000 |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |accessdate=25 August 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61DIXBNSm |archivedate=25 August 2011}}</ref> The date was rescheduled for August.

When asked for payment, they were informed by [[Johnny Wright (music manager)|Johnny Wright]] they were not entitled to any funds. The lawsuit was dismissed in November 2000.\n\nThe band faced another lawsuit in December 2000 filled by a [[Missouri]] teenager.

The performances of \"No Strings Attached\", \"Digital Get Down\" and the medley were edited out.\n\n==Critical response==\nThe tour received mixed reviews from music critics, with the majority of reviews being positives. Many critics applauded the band's onstage persona however felt the theatrics of the concert took away from the heart of the show. Jim Abbott (''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'') said the band \"made the crowd feel at home\" during the concert at the TD Waterhouse Centre. He continues, \"But the power of this concert was in its impeccable production. It was an assault on the senses from the moment the five singers were lowered to the stage as human marionettes for the opening \"No Strings Attached\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2000-11-02/news/0011020330_1_band-bye-n-sync |title=`n Sync Excites, Even In Reruns |author=Abbott, Jim |date=2 November 2000 |work=[[Orlando Sentinel]] |accessdate=25 August 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61DHh0vFs |archivedate=25 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nJim Farber (''[[New York Daily News]]'') felt the shows at Madison Square Garden were \"clich\u00e9 and contrived\". He explains, \"In fact, Tuesday's show proved there certainly are strings attached, though the tugging on NSYNC's post-adolescent limbs is coming not from unseen handlers but from a more insidious force. Namely: the guys' own need to please. That they have an overwhelming desire to placate their youngest fans seemed obvious, since the show conformed to the most worn clich\u00e9s of current teen-pop\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2000-07-27/entertainment/18149783_1_strings-n-sync-bye |title='No Strings,' But Bound To Wow 'Em 'n Sync Live: Kid Stuff, Clich\u00e9s & Genuine Talent |author=Farber, Jim |date=27 July 2000 |work=New York Daily News |accessdate=25 August 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61DMREKEl|archivedate=25 August 2011}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/the-summers-hottest-tours-n-sync-244158/|title=The Summer's Hottest Tours: 'N Sync|last=Puterbaugh|first=Parke|last2=Puterbaugh|first2=Parke|date=2000-08-17|website=Rolling Stone|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-18}}</ref>\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.nsync.com 'N Sync's Official Website]\n\n{{'N Sync}}\n\n[[Category:NSYNC concert tours]]\n[[Category:2000 concert tours]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox concert tour\n| concert_tour_name = No Strings Attached Tour\n| image             = Nsync nsatourposter.jpg\n| image_size        = 220px\n| artist            = [[NSYNC]]\n| album             = ''[[No Strings Attached (NSYNC album)|No Strings Attached]]''\n| start_date        = {{Start date|2000|05|09}}\n| end_date          = {{End date|2000|12|01}}\n| number_of_legs    = 2\n| number_of_shows   = 82\n| gross             = $36,757,613\n| last_tour         = [[NSYNC in Concert]] <br>(1998\u20132000)\n| this_tour         = '''No Strings Attached Tour''' <br>(2000)\n| next_tour         = [[PopOdyssey]] <br>(2001)\n| Misc              = \n}}\n\nThe '''No Strings Attached Tour''' was the third concert tour by American [[boy band]], [[NSYNC]].

In response to the additional dates, [[Joey Fatone]] stated, <blockquote>\"We\u2019re real excited about that. But I think we\u2019re just going to do a great show again. You know, a lot of people have seen some of the show. But you know, every show that we do is different.

As the second North American leg came to a close, the band announced they would star in their first feature [[concert film]]. The film was released exclusively through [[IMAX]] theaters for six months. Additionally, the band partnered with [[MSN]] to give fans exclusive access to newsletters, photos and video footage. Known as \"NSYNC@MSN\", the service provided web and email access along with [[Windows Live Messenger|MSN Messenger]] and [[Windows Media Player]].\n\n===Concert synopsis===\nThe show began NSYNC revealed as marionettes dropping 40 feet above the stage featuring a small sample of ''[[I Got No Strings]]''. When they land, the group cuts the strings and unhooked themselves before heading into two dance-oriented performances of ''No Strings Attached'' and ''[[I Want You Back (NSYNC song)|I Want You Back]]''. This was followed by Lance Bass welcoming the crowd before slowing things down with a performance of ''[[(God Must Have Spent) A Little More Time on You]]'' which the group rose 30 feet above the stage on 5 small platforms.\n\nAfter the group left the stage, there was a video interlude hosted by television persona [[Ananda Lewis]] called ''Total *NSYNC Live'' (parody of ''[[Total Request Live]]'') which fans were given 4 selections of possible songs that *NSYNC would sing next. The first 3-song choices (''[[Yankee Doodle Dandy]]'', ''[[Three Blind Mice]]'', and ''[[Twinkle Twinkle Little Star]]'') always ended up getting jeers and a laugh from the crowd. By the time Lewis says the 4th option ''[[Tearin' Up My Heart]]'', the crowd goes wild, it gets selected as the chosen song, and the group returns to the stage dressed in freestyle clothing (almost like their previous wardrobe from their last tour) to perform the song.\n\nThe show then continues with Justin Timberlake returning the stage showcasing some his freestyle [[Beatbox]] skills before the group's drummer begins to upstage him and calling him out, Timberlake challenges the drummer to a battle which ends in victory for Timberlake. The rest of the group returns to the stage in urban attire to perform ''[[It's Gonna Be Me]]''. This was followed by the group putting together a living room setting to slow things down again with 2 ballads ''[[I Drive Myself Crazy]]'' and ''I Thought She Knew''.\n\nAfter the group leaves the stage again, another interlude is shown featuring the group heading into their quick change room featuring circus people, an arcade, and a movie Theatre. They then returns to the stage dressed in club attire all designed with money on it for a performance of \"[[Just Got Paid (Johnny Kemp song)|Just Got Paid]]\". During the song, pre-selected fans were chosen to go up on stage and dance with the group with confetti dropping everywhere. They also introduce their band members before all leaving the stage again.\n\nThe show continues with a futuristic interlude which included a laser lightshow and the face of the ''No Strings Attached'' clown mascot (with a robot voice) appearing out of a virtual head giving the audience riddles. NSYNC then rises out of the floor dressed in mid western futuristic attire for a performance of ''Space Cowboy'' featuring an extended dance break. At the end of the song, the group goes back down into the ground with the band playing an extended instrumental interlude of the chorus. It ends abruptly with the sound of a car crashing, a woman screaming, a man yelling \"Someone's hurt\", and the sound of an ambulance siren. NSYNC returns to the stage in a little brief hospital skit dressed in doctor lab coats taking care of an injured Timberlake before heading into ''It Makes Me Ill''. This was followed by the group bringing out stools to slow things down for another song. However, Chasez comes up with an idea to go more closer to the crowd. The group brings out the stools before the center piece of the stage breaks. The stage piece (on a track) brings the members out to the center of the arena getting closer to the crowd ending the main set list with ''[[This I Promise You]]''. The stage piece goes back to where it was, the group takes their bows, and leaves the stage.\nThe show continues with a large video screen that says \"*NSYNC\" appeared on the set while the band dressed on a futuristic space with Digital Get Down while NSYNC disappeared on a video screen wall and then we concludes the encore set with ''[[Bye Bye Bye]]'', As the guys walks over the platform stage, they say goodbye and walks over the main stage while JC walks over and introduced to the musicians. The group then disappears through a geyser as fireworks go off at the same time.\n\n===Occurrences===\nDespite the success of the tour, it faced a few bumps in the road. The bands were targets for an assassination by a male teenager. The mother of the [[Hendersonville, Tennessee]], teenager discovered a notebook that contained a detailed plan to kill all five members of the band during their show in Atlanta. The plan (called \"Operation Deathstrike\") featured the teen robbing a local gun store to obtain the weapons and money to carry out his plan. The mother informed the local authorities and the teen was detained at the [[Sumner County, Tennessee|Sumner County Juvenile Detention Center]].

The video was certified platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] on March 9, 2001. The concerts at [[Madison Square Garden]] were filmed for a [[HBO]] special. The special attracted over six million viewers, becoming one of the highest rated concert specials on the network. The concert aired on July 27, 2000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2000-05-10/entertainment/18139821_1_joe-trela-sync-variety-show |title=Youth Will Be Served: 'n Sync On Hbo |author= |date=10 May 2000 |work=[[New York Daily News]] |accessdate=25 August 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61DK3Iirg |archivedate=25 August 2011}}</ref> The concerts were released on VHS and DVD on November 21, 2000.

The performances of \"No Strings Attached\", \"Digital Get Down\" and the medley were edited out.\n\n==Critical response==\nThe tour received mixed reviews from music critics, with the majority of reviews being positives. Many critics applauded the band's onstage persona however felt the theatrics of the concert took away from the heart of the show. Jim Abbott (''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'') said the band \"made the crowd feel at home\" during the concert at the TD Waterhouse Centre. He continues, \"But the power of this concert was in its impeccable production. It was an assault on the senses from the moment the five singers were lowered to the stage as human marionettes for the opening \"No Strings Attached\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2000-11-02/news/0011020330_1_band-bye-n-sync |title=`n Sync Excites, Even In Reruns |author=Abbott, Jim |date=2 November 2000 |work=[[Orlando Sentinel]] |accessdate=25 August 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61DHh0vFs |archivedate=25 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nJim Farber (''[[New York Daily News]]'') felt the shows at Madison Square Garden were \"clich\u00e9 and contrived\". He explains, \"In fact, Tuesday's show proved there certainly are strings attached, though the tugging on NSYNC's post-adolescent limbs is coming not from unseen handlers but from a more insidious force. Namely: the guys' own need to please.

Radios in the 1930s were based on [[vacuum tube]]s powered by a small motor-generator called a [[dynamotor]]. The dynamotor took from 1/10 to 1/4 of a second to \"spin up\" to full power. Police officers were trained to push the microphone button, then pause briefly before speaking; however, sometimes they would forget to wait. Preceding each code with \"ten-\" gave the radio transmitter time to reach full power.

[[C. W. McCall]]'s hit song \"[[Convoy (song)|Convoy]]\" (1975), depicting conversation among CB-communicating [[trucker]]s, put phrases like ''10-4'' and ''what's your twenty?'' (10-20 for \"where are you?\") into common use in American English.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe movie ''[[Convoy (1978 film)|Convoy]]'' (1978), loosely based on McCall's song, further entrenched ten-codes in casual conversation.\n\nThe ten-codes used by the [[New York Police Department]]<ref>https://wiki.radioreference.com/index.php/New_York_City_(NY)_Law_Enforcement. Retrieved December 7, 2017.</ref> have returned to public attention thanks to the popularity of the television series ''[[Blue Bloods (TV series)|Blue Bloods]]''. However, the ten-codes used by the NYPD are not the same as those used in the APCO system. For example, in the NYPD system, Code 10-13 means \"Officer needs help,\" whereas in the APCO system \"Officer needs help\" is Code 10-33.\n\nThe New Zealand [[reality television]] show ''[[Police Ten 7]]'' takes its name from the New Zealand Police ten-code 10-7, which means \"Unit has arrived at job\".\n\nIn the last episode of the anime ''Kekkai Sensen & Beyond'', Leonardo uses the code 10-33 in a message to signal that he is in a situation beyond his control.\n\nThe syndicated [[internet radio]] countdown program \"What's your Twenty\"<ref>http://www.wddfradio.com/what-s-your-twenty.html</ref> is named after the code for location.\n\nA [[Facebook group]] named ''I'm 10-15'' (meaning \"aliens in custody\") is allegedly used by some [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] employees. In July 2019, the group was reported to contain both racist, sexist discussions and [[caricature]] [[meme]]s, along with threats against congresswomen scheduled to visit a Customs and Border Protection facility.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Thompson |first1=A.

Radios in the 1930s were based on [[vacuum tube]]s powered by a small motor-generator called a [[dynamotor]]. The dynamotor took from 1/10 to 1/4 of a second to \"spin up\" to full power. Police officers were trained to push the microphone button, then pause briefly before speaking; however, sometimes they would forget to wait. Preceding each code with \"ten-\" gave the radio transmitter time to reach full power. An APCO Bulletin of January 1940 lists codes assigned as part of standardization;<ref name=Bulletin>[http://28011b0082f55a9e1ec0-aecfa82ae628504f4b1d229bd9030ae1.r13.cf1.rackcdn.com/1940-01-p008-200.pdf http://28011b0082f55a9e1ec0-aecfa82ae628504f4b1d229bd9030ae1.r13.cf1.rackcdn.com/1940-01-p008-200.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170810212357/http://28011b0082f55a9e1ec0-aecfa82ae628504f4b1d229bd9030ae1.r13.cf1.rackcdn.com/1940-01-p008-200.pdf |date=2017-08-10 }}, p.8</ref>\n\nIn 1954, APCO published an article describing a proposed simplification of the code, based on an analysis conducted by the San Diego Police Department.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.apcohistory.org/apco-collection/search/profile/article/A30356|title=Codes And Signals - More Discussion On The Radio Code Problems|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> In the September 1955 issue of the APCO Bulletin, a revision of the Ten-Signals was proposed,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://28011b0082f55a9e1ec0-aecfa82ae628504f4b1d229bd9030ae1.r13.cf1.rackcdn.com/1955-09-pp008-200.pdf|title=Proposed Revision Of \"10\" Signals|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> and it was later adopted. \n\nThe Ten Signals were included in APCO Project Two (1967), \"Public Safety Standard Operating Procedures Manual\", published as study cards in APCO Project 4 (1973), \"Ten Signal Cards\", and then revised in APCO Project 14 (1974).<ref>{{cite web|title=The Origin of The Ten Code|url=http://www.freqofnature.com/index.php?m=articles&p=brevity%20codes|accessdate=27 April 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150618100816/http://www.freqofnature.com/index.php?m=articles&p=brevity%20codes|archivedate=18 June 2015|df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=APCO Projects|url=https://www.apcointl.org/about-apco/apco-projects.html|accessdate=27 April 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150618160414/https://www.apcointl.org/about-apco/apco-projects.html|archivedate=18 June 2015|df=}}</ref><ref>[http://www.911dispatch.com/info/tencode.html 9-Code, 10-Code.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150320040332/http://www.911dispatch.com/info/tencode.html |date=2015-03-20 }} Dispatch Magazine online.</ref><ref name=\"Rafik Jabbour\">{{cite web|title=Official Ten-Code List  Association of Public Communications Officers (APCO)|url=http://spiffy.ci.uiuc.edu/~kline/Stuff/ten-codes.html|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013030055/http://spiffy.ci.uiuc.edu/~kline/Stuff/ten-codes.html|archivedate=2007-10-13|df=}}</ref>\n\n===In popular culture===\nTen-codes, especially \"10-4\" (meaning \"understood\") first reached public recognition in the mid- to late-1950s through the popular television series ''[[Highway Patrol (U.S. TV series)|Highway Patrol]]'', with [[Broderick Crawford]]. Crawford would reach into his patrol car to use the [[microphone]] to answer a call and precede his response with \"10-4\".\n\nTen-codes were adapted for use by [[Citizens band radio|CB radio]] enthusiasts. [[C. W. McCall]]'s hit song \"[[Convoy (song)|Convoy]]\" (1975), depicting conversation among CB-communicating [[trucker]]s, put phrases like ''10-4'' and ''what's your twenty?'' (10-20 for \"where are you?\") into common use in American English.\n\nThe movie ''[[Convoy (1978 film)|Convoy]]'' (1978), loosely based on McCall's song, further entrenched ten-codes in casual conversation.\n\nThe ten-codes used by the [[New York Police Department]]<ref>https://wiki.radioreference.com/index.php/New_York_City_(NY)_Law_Enforcement. Retrieved December 7, 2017.</ref> have returned to public attention thanks to the popularity of the television series ''[[Blue Bloods (TV series)|Blue Bloods]]''. However, the ten-codes used by the NYPD are not the same as those used in the APCO system. For example, in the NYPD system, Code 10-13 means \"Officer needs help,\" whereas in the APCO system \"Officer needs help\" is Code 10-33.\n\nThe New Zealand [[reality television]] show ''[[Police Ten 7]]'' takes its name from the New Zealand Police ten-code 10-7, which means \"Unit has arrived at job\".\n\nIn the last episode of the anime ''Kekkai Sensen & Beyond'', Leonardo uses the code 10-33 in a message to signal that he is in a situation beyond his control.\n\nThe syndicated [[internet radio]] countdown program \"What's your Twenty\"<ref>http://www.wddfradio.com/what-s-your-twenty.html</ref> is named after the code for location.\n\nA [[Facebook group]] named ''I'm 10-15'' (meaning \"aliens in custody\") is allegedly used by some [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] employees. In July 2019, the group was reported to contain both racist, sexist discussions and [[caricature]] [[meme]]s, along with threats against congresswomen scheduled to visit a Customs and Border Protection facility.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Thompson |first1=A.
