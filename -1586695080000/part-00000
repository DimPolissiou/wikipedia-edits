While other physicians such as [[Ernst von Bergmann]] suggested surgical removal of the entire larynx, Virchow was opposed to it because no successful operation of this kind had ever been done. The British surgeon [[Morell Mackenzie]], performed a [[biopsy]] in 1887 and sent it to Virchow, who identified it as \"pachydermia verrucosa laryngis\". Virchow affirmed that the tissues were not cancerous, even after several biopsy tests. The Kaiser died on 15 June 1888. The next day a post-mortem examination was performed by Virchow and his assistant. They found that the larynx was extensively damaged by ulceration, and microscopic examination confirmed [[carcinoma|epidermal carcinoma]]. ''Die Krankheit Kaiser Friedrich des Dritten (The Medical Report of Kaiser Frederick III)'' was published on 11 July under the lead authorship of Bergmann.

This resulted in prolonged public debate with Virchow. A few days later Virchow responded that Darwinism was only a hypothesis, and morally dangerous to students. This severe criticism of Darwinism was immediately taken up by the London ''[[The Times|Times]]'', from which further debates erupted among English scholars. Haeckel wrote his arguments in the October issue of ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' titled \"The Present Position of Evolution Theory\", to which Virchow responded in the next issue with an article \"The Liberty of Science in the Modern State\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Porter|first1=Theodore M.|title=Karl Pearson: The Scientific Life in a Statistical Age|year=2006|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=978-1-400-83570-6|page=36|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YFwckVLO-9UC&dq}}</ref> The debate led Haeckel to write a full book ''Freedom in Science and Teaching'' in 1879.

His political views are evident in his ''Report on the Typhus Outbreak of Upper Silesia'', where he states that the outbreak could not be solved by treating individual patients with drugs or with minor changes in food, housing, or clothing laws, but only through radical action to promote the advancement of an entire population, which could only be achieved by \"full and unlimited democracy\" and \"education, freedom and prosperity\".<ref name=brown2006/>\n\nThese radical statements and his minor part in the revolution caused the government to remove him from his position in 1849, although within a year he was reinstated as prosector 'on probation'. Prosector was a secondary position in the hospital. This secondary position in Berlin convinced him to accept the chair of pathological anatomy at the medical school in the provincial town of W\u00fcrzburg, where he continued his scientific research.

He edited alone after Reinhardt's death in 1852 till his own.<ref name=weisenberg/><ref name=encyclo2004/> This journal published critical articles based on the criterion that no papers would be published that contained outdated, untested, dogmatic or speculative ideas. Unlike his German peers, Virchow had great faith in clinical observation, [[Animal Experimentation|animal experimentation]] (to determine causes of diseases and the effects of drugs) and pathological anatomy, particularly at the microscopic level, as the basic principles of investigation in medical sciences. He went further and stated that the cell was the basic unit of the body that had to be studied to understand disease. Although the term 'cell' had been coined in the 1665 by an English scientist [[Robert Hooke]], the building blocks of life were still considered to be the 21 tissues of Bichat, a concept described by the French physician [[Xavier Bichat]].<ref name=americana/><ref name=\"Bagot2008\">{{cite journal|author=Bagot, C.

The British surgeon [[Morell Mackenzie]], performed a [[biopsy]] in 1887 and sent it to Virchow, who identified it as \"pachydermia verrucosa laryngis\". Virchow affirmed that the tissues were not cancerous, even after several biopsy tests. The Kaiser died on 15 June 1888. The next day a post-mortem examination was performed by Virchow and his assistant. They found that the larynx was extensively damaged by ulceration, and microscopic examination confirmed [[carcinoma|epidermal carcinoma]].

The ready availability of skilled labour encouraged new industries to the town both before and after the [[Second World War]].

Chesham has become a [[commuter town]] with improved connection to London via the [[London Underground]] and road networks. The town centre has been progressively redeveloped since the 1960s and was pedestrianised in the 1990s.

[[William the Conqueror]] shared out the estates between four of his dependants. The vast majority of land was granted to Hugh de Bolebec and smaller parcels to [[Odo, Bishop of Bayeux]], Toustain Mantel and Alsi.<ref name=\"RoBVol3\" />\n\nBefore the 13th century the three Cestreham manors were known as Chesham Higham, Chesham Bury and Chesham Boys (or 'Bois'). In the 14th century they were first recorded as 'the manors of Great Chesham'. Collectively they extended beyond the current Chesham town boundary.<ref name=\"RoBVol3\" /> Together with the manor at Latimer they were held by the [[Earl of Oxford|Earls of Oxford]] and [[Earl of Surrey|Surrey]]. During the 16th century Greater Chesham was owned by the [[Seymour family]] who disposed of it to the Cavendish family who were [[Earl of Devonshire|the Earls and later Dukes of Devonshire]]. It is from the 15th century that the earliest surviving properties survive and are to be found close by the church in an area called ''the Nap'', and along part of the present-day Church Street. Though gradually disposing of land the Cavendishes maintained an influence in the town until the 19th century. The Lowndes family started purchasing land from the 16th century. [[William Lowndes (British politician)|William Lowndes]] was an influential politician and [[Secretary to the Treasury]] during the reigns of [[Mary II of England|Mary II]], [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]]. He rebuilt the original Bury and [[manor house]] of Great Chesham in 1712. The Lowndes family settled in Chesham and over the next 200 years became equally influential both nationally through politics and the law and locally within the town as its principal benefactors.<ref name=\"Hunt 1977\" />\n\n===Ecclesiastical history===\nNo evidence remains of any church prior to the Norman Conquest. However, the siting of [[Hertfordshire puddingstone|puddingstones]] beneath the present-day church suggests a wooden church was constructed on the site during the Anglo-Saxon period. During the 12th century two families of Norman descent, the de Bolebecs and the Sifrewasts, each held a share of the [[advowson]] assigned to the adjacent manors of Chesham Higham and Chesham Bury respectively for the Church at Chesham which it is evidenced from about 1154 was dedicated to St Mary.<ref>{{Citation|first1=Shirley|last1=Foxell|first2=Clive|last2=Foxell|title=St Mary's Church, Chesham|year=2004|publisher=Clive Foxell|place=Chesham|isbn=0-9529184-4-7|ref=harv}}</ref> These moieties were subsequently given by the families to two [[monastery|monasteries]]. In 1194 the de Bolbecs bestowed their advowson to the abbot and monks of [[Woburn Abbey]] and henceforth the parish of Chesham Higham was renamed 'Chesham Woburn'. Meanwhile, and sometime before 1199, the Sifrewast family granted their advowson to the [[convent]] of St Mary's de Pr\u00e9 Leicester. As a consequence the advowson for the parish of Chesham Bury became known as 'Chesham Leicester'.<ref name=\"BHOChesham\">[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=42547 British History online Chesham], Retrieved 14 June 2013</ref> In 1536 [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] seized control of church property as part of the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]]. Subsequently, during [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]] and [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]'s reigns, first Chesham Woburn and then Chesham Leicester advowsons became part of the estates of the [[Dukes of Bedford]]. Though there were originally two vicars appointed to the [[St. Mary's Church, Chesham|parish church of St Mary's]] from the 17th century a single [[Incumbent (ecclesiastical)|incumbent]] was appointed. Jurisdiction was still shared between both advowsons and two parsonages, an 'upper' and 'lower', continued to be maintained until the 18th century when both were superseded by a single new parsonage.<ref name=\"BHOChesham\" /> The Duke of Bedford subsequently consolidated the moieties by Act of Parliament in 1767.<ref name=\"RoBVol3\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=FsMMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA63&dq=chesham&hl=en&sa=X&ei=YVG6UYjlBcKk0QWey4CAAg&ved=0CFUQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=chesham&f=false Records Of Buckinghamshire Vol 3 1870], Retrieved 14 June 2013</ref> To accommodate the increasing population during the 19th century a new parish church were built in 1867; Christ Church at Waterside, and further churches were built at Ashley Green and Bellingdon which were at the time both within the civil parish of Chesham.<ref name=\"BHOChesham\" /> [[File:Thomas Harding memorial.jpg|thumb|Thomas Harding memorial]]\n\n===Religious dissent and nonconformity===\nChesham is noted for the religious dissent which dominated the town from the 15th century. In 1532 [[Thomas Harding]] was [[burnt at the stake]] in the town for being a [[Lollard]] and [[heresy|heretic]]. From the 17th century Chesham was a focus for [[English Dissenters|those dissenting from mainstream religion]]. [[Quaker]]s met in the late 17th century in Chesham and in 1798 they built the current [[Friends meeting house|meeting house]]. The first [[Baptists]]' meeting dates back to about 1640 and a place was registered for services in 1706. The first chapel was opened in 1712, one of many to be built for the various Baptist groups during the 18th and 19th centuries. [[John Wesley]] preached in Chesham in the 1760s and a Wesleyan [[Methodist]] society existed in the town. In more recent time a [[Methodist Church of Great Britain|Wesleyan Methodist]] chapel was opened in 1897. The [[Christian Brethren]] which date back in Chesham to 1876, opened their Gospel Hall in 1895, which closed in December 2008.  Broadway Baptist church had branches at the Vale, Hawridge, Ashley Green and Chartridge; only the one at Chartridge survives.  Trinity Baptist church had branches at Hyde Heath, Ley Hill and Whelpley Hill; only the one at Hyde Heath survives.  The Congregational Church had branches at Asheridge and Pond Park.\n\n===Emigration to the American colonies===\nIn 1630 Aquila Chase left Chesham to join the colony, settling first at Hampton (now New Hampshire), then [[Newbury, Massachusetts]]. Descendants of Aquila became influential in shaping political, legislative and commercial matters from the colonial period until after the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. For example, [[Salmon P. Chase]] was the United States Treasury Secretary and Chief Justice in the 1870s. The [[Chase Manhattan Bank]] is named after him (although Chase did not have any connection with the bank).<ref>[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/JP-Morgan-Chase-amp;-Co-Company-History.html History of Chase Manhattan Bank], Retrieved 12 May 2009</ref><ref>[http://www.politicalfamilytree.com/samples%20content/members/chief_justices/Chase-OH-1.pdf Genealogy of Chase family], Retrieved 12 May 2009</ref>\n\n===Industrial development===\nThe primary industries of the town in [[medieval]] times were flour production, woodworking and weaving of wool. There were four mills built along the Chess which was diverted to generate sufficient power. Surplus flour was supplied to London. The number of clothworkers, including spinners and those associated with dying ([[fuller (disambiguation)|fuller]]s), grew rapidly between 1530 and 1730 and became the major industry in the town prior to a period of rapid decline. Between 1740 and 1798 mills were converted to produce paper (pulp) responding to London's insatiable demand for paper. However, technological developments in paper-making elsewhere rendered the mills unprofitable and they reverted to flour production in the 1850s.\n[[File:Chesham Town picture.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Painting of Chesham town, circa 1750]]\nNew industries emerged from the 16th century onwards. The woodlands had been a source of firewood for London during the mediaeval period. A small-scale woodenware industry; making shovels, brooms, spoons and chairs, began around 1538 and its expansion was accompanied by the planting of beechwoods between 17th and 19th centuries.<ref name=\"Hunt 1977\" /> [[Straw plaiting]] was seen as home-based work for the wives and daughters of labourers from the 18th century. Straw was also imported from Italy to produce the superior 'Tuscan plait' traded at a Saturday market for the [[Luton]] and [[Dunstable]] hat trade and remained the major cottage industry until around 1860, providing employment for women and girls some of whom attended a 'plait-school' in [[Waterside, Buckinghamshire|Waterside]].<ref name=\"Hunt 1977\" /> [[Lace]] making developed in the 16th century as a cottage industry and was valued for its quality. Chesham specialised in black lace. The industry declined in the 1850s due to mechanisation in [[Nottingham]].<ref name=\"Hunt 1977\" /> Between 1838 and 1864 silk-spinning, powered by a steam-driven mill in Waterside was started to make use of unemployed lace workers. This trend was relatively short-lived as changes in fashion and the growth of the railways resulted in competition from elsewhere for the valuable London markets.<ref name=\"Hunt 1977\" /> However one exception was the firm of George Tutill, which specialised in high-quality [[Banner-making|banners]] and was responsible for three-quarters of those made for trade unions. The firm is still a going concern still specialising in flags and banners.\n\nThree of the four Bs that have shaped Chesham's history relate to its industries. '''Brush''' making was introduced around 1829 to make use of the off-cuts from woodworking. '''Boot''' and shoe making which started as a [[cottage industry]] later expanding through small workshops thrived following the opening of [[tanneries]] around 1792 which also supplied leather for [[saddle]] making and [[gloves|glove]]. By the mid-19th century both brushmaking and footwear manufacture became major industries in the town with production concentrated in large factories. The industry declined in the early-20th century as the market for heavy boots declined. '''Beer''' brewing grew rapidly around the town centre in the 19th century again declining at the start of the 20th century.<ref name=\"Hunt 1977\" /> These traditional industries were succeeded by smaller but more commercial enterprises which took advantage of the available skilled labour. For example, in 1908 the Chiltern Toy Works was opened by Joseph Eisenmann on Bellingdon Road, later moving to the 'new' industrial estate in Waterside, making high quality [[teddy bears]]. The works finally closed in 1960.<ref>[http://www.luckybears.com/encyclopaedia_chiltern.asp Chiltern Teddy Bear factory]</ref> Post Second World War industry has ranged from the manufacture of glue ([[Adhesive|Industrial Adhesives]]) to aluminium-based packaging ([[Alcan]]), Aluminium Castings & Bronze Castings (Draycast Foundries Limited) and [[balloon]]s (B-Loony).\n\n===The town in times of war===\n[[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] imposed a tax on the town to pay for his wars against Scotland and France.\n\nIn common with the majority of communities in Buckinghamshire, Chesham's [[Lollard]] heritage and [[puritan]] traditions ensured it would vehemently resist [[King Charles I of England|King Charles I]]'s demand for [[Ship Money]]; a tax on tradesmen and landowners. In 1635 the townsfolk of Chesham protested to the Sheriff of Buckinghamshire, Sir Peter Temple, who was reluctantly enforcing a writ requiring payment of a levy to the King. Not surprisingly given the local allegiances to [[John Hampden]], the towns' people largely sided with the [[Roundheads|Parliamentarians]] at the outbreak of the [[English Civil War]]. During 1642 the influential Parliamentarians [[John Pym]] and [[Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick|Earl of Warwick]] were headquartered in the town along with large numbers of troops. There are records of skirmishes in the area during 1643 when [[Prince Rupert]] was stationed near Aylesbury and dispatched [[Robert Dormer, 1st Earl of Carnarvon]] to pillage nearby towns, such as [[Wendover]]. Heading toward Chesham a company of horse of the Parliamentary Army from the town met them outside Great Missenden where a skirmish took place ending with the Parliamentary force being driven back.<ref name=\"RoBVol3\" />\n\nThe records of the [[Posse comitatus (common law)|Posse Comitatus]] for Chesham in 1798 recorded over 800 men between the ages of 16\u201360 enrolled in a militia to defend the town in the event of invasion by [[Napoleon I]] or to deal with civil unrest. Less than 50 years later, in 1846 a similar register of 22 able-bodied men had been assembled to form the Chesham troop of the [[Royal Buckinghamshire Yeomanry]] which coincided with the billeting of troops from the [[7th Hussars|Queen's Own 7th Hussars]] passing through the town on their way to Ireland.<ref name=\"Birch 1997\">{{cite book |last=Birch|first=Clive|title=The Book of Chesham |year=1997 |publisher=Quotes Limited |location=England |isbn=0-86023-641-2}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[First World War]] 188 servicemen from Chesham lost their lives (see Landmarks). [[Alfred Alexander Burt|Alfred Burt]] a corporal in the [[Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Regiment]] from Chesham received the [[Victoria Cross]] for his actions in September 1915. The town provided temporary quarters for several regiments including the [[King's Royal Rifle Corps|Kings Royal Rifles]] and the [[Royal Engineers]] honed their bridge building skills in local parks. Over the duration of the [[Second World War]] 80 servicemen lost their lives. Air raid shelters were built by the Council in 1940 although the official view was that the not being a strategic location the town was unlikely to be targeted. In fact at the end of the war it was estimated that 45 bombs fell in the Chesham area and it is known that nine people were killed.<ref>{{cite book |last=Baines, Arnold &|first=Birch, Clive|title=Chesham Century |year=1994 |publisher=Quotes Limited |location=England |isbn=0-86023-549-1}}</ref>\n\n===Social history===\nA Chesham [[workhouse]] for 90 paupers was operating in Germain Street as early as 1777. New legislation transferred the control of the Chesham institution to Amersham [[Poor Law Union]] in 1835. However, there were long-standing rivalries between the locals of both towns and in July that year violence broke out when an order was given to remove the paupers to Amersham. The [[Riot Act]] was read out to an angry crowd of 500 and arrests followed.<ref>[http://www.workhouses.org.uk/index.html?Amersham/Amersham.shtml Times reports riots outside Chesham Workhouse]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605224359/http://www.workhouses.org.uk/index.html?Amersham%2FAmersham.shtml |date=5 June 2011 }}</ref>\n\nPublicly funded education started with the opening of a [[British and Foreign School Society|British School]] in 1825 followed by a [[national school (England and Wales)|National School]] in 1845, an [[Infant school|Infants' Schoo]]l in 1851 and the first Elementary School for girls in 1864.

The first purpose-built cinema, ''The Empire Picture Hall'', opened in Station Road in 1912 and in 1914 ''The Chesham Palace'' started up in The Broadway. Both showed silent films. By 1920 the Empire had closed. In 1930 the Chesham Palace was refurbished to show the new 'talkies' and reopened as ''The Astoria'' which remained in business until 1959 when the arrival of television forced it to close. ''The Embassy'' in Germain Street opened in 1935 and survived until 1982, closing due to competition from cinemas in nearby towns. ''The Elgiva Theatre'', completed in 1976 beside St Mary's Way, was equipped to show films and on moving to a new site just across the road in 1998 state of the art projection equipment was installed in the new theatre (see image below).<ref>{{Cite book |last=Foxell|first=Clive |title=The Ten Cinemas of Chesham|year=2010 |publisher=Clive Foxell |location=Chesham England |isbn=978-0-9564178-0-0}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nThe town is in the Chess Valley 13 miles south-east of the county town [[Aylesbury]] and is 25 miles (40&nbsp;km) north west of central London.

Until the 19th century the town was centred to the south-eastern end of the present High Street. Most of the present-day town centre's development took place during Victorian times. The 'old town', particularly Church and Germain Street, has been well preserved and now designated a [[conservation area]]. It includes a number of impressive residential, institutional and commercial buildings that largely survived Victorian 'improvement'. The 12th century St Mary's Church, which underwent refurbishment and redesign by [[George Gilbert Scott]] in the 19th century. 'The Bury', a Queen Anne [[town house]] was built in 1712 for [[William Lowndes (British politician)|William Lowndes]] [[Secretary to the Treasury]]. Chesham had two [[workhouse]]s, both buildings survived and are located in Germain Street. In June 2009 the Chesham town centre and old town conservation area was placed on the [[English Heritage]] Conservation Areas at Risk register which the District Council commented was due to the misinterpretation of its responses to the conservation body's questionnaire.<ref>[http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/server/show/nav.20516 English Heritage National Survey of Conservation Areas at Risk, June 2009] Retrieved, 1 July 2009</ref><ref>[http://chesham.buckinghamshireadvertiser.co.uk/2009/06/chesham-conservation-area-safe.html Chesham conservation area 'safe' Bucks Examiner 29 June 2009]{{Dead link|date=November 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Retrieved, 1 July 2009</ref> Due to the pattern of the town's expansion there are several centres of employment which are interspersed with residential housing.

As a consequence the centre of the town shifted to the east as shops, workshops and cottages sprung up along the High Street and Berkhampstead Road.  In the period after the [[Second World War]] the town centre was progressively redeveloped. In the 1960s St Mary's Way was constructed, rerouting the [[A416 road|A416]] around the congested High Street which avoided the need to widen the street, conserved its character and allowed for its pedestrianisation during the 1990s. Industrial development became centred on two areas. At the southern end of the town at [[Waterside, Buckinghamshire|Waterside]] which was the site of the first mills and factories in the 18th and 19th centuries there is a mixture of original and newly constructed industrial units and at the northern end along the Asheridge Vale there is a further development of generally small commercial business units.\n\nCompared to other towns in south Buckinghamshire, there are fewer detached and owner-occupied houses and a higher proportion of social rental accommodation.<ref name=\"CDCcorestrategy\" /> Expansion in housing has occurred in several phases mainly to the east of the old town where [[artisan]]'s housing sprung up along Berkhamsted Road and subsequently along the many steep valley sides. Initially this development was as a consequence of the extension of the railway to the town in the 1880s, subsequently the promotion of [[Metro-land|Metroland]] during the 1920s and the electrification of the [[Metropolitan line]] in the 1960s. Pond Park estate was built in the 1930s. The population grew fast after the Second World War as workers followed employers who moved out from London. The population in 1951 was 11,500 leading to the building of the Chessmount and Hilltop estates by speculative developers in the 1950s and '60s.  By 1971 the population had reached 20,000 since when it has only increased slightly. The growing popularity of the Chilterns as a place to live from the latter part of the 20th century onwards led to restrictions on housing and industrial development in the Chilterns [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]] and has sustained the demand for further house building in the town. Today an increasing number of those in employment find work outside the town, commuting by car or train as well as an increasing number who are home or office-based using technology to make a living.\n\n===Climate===\nChesham experiences an [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Cfb'') similar to almost all of the United Kingdom, although the lower parts of the valley have significant frost hollow characteristics \u2013 being several degrees colder than surrounding areas on clear, calm nights and so have much lower average minimum temperatures than shown in the table.

The turret is a reconstruction of the one built onto the original town hall in the 19th century and features the original glass-dialled clock face and clock mechanism from the mid 19th century.<ref>[http://www.chesham.gov.uk/Open_Spaces/Clock_Tower.aspx Chesham Town Clock Tower]</ref>\n\n===War memorial===\nChesham [[war memorial]] stands in a landscaped garden in the Broadway. It depicts an [[infantryman]] with his rifle inverted and commemorates those who fell during the [[First World War|First]] and [[Second World War]]s. It was designed by the sculptor [[Arthur George Walker]] and unveiled in 1921. The inscription reads:- ''To The Glorious Memory Of The Men Of The Town Who Gave Their Lives And To Honour:'' ''All Who Served Or Suffered In Cause Of God King And Country Their Deeds Live After Them Faithful Unto Death''.<ref>[http://www.roll-of-honour.com/Buckinghamshire/Chesham.html Chesham War Memorial and Roll of Honour]</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n\n===Agriculture===\nThere is evidence during the pre-Norman period of common fields divided into parcels and strips of land. The [[Domesday Book]] records Chesham with sufficient arable land to support four [[Water wheel|water-powered]] [[corn mill]]s on the River Chess producing a surplus of flour exported to London. There was woodland to feed over 1600 pigs and supply timber for local manufacturing of farm tools (ploughshares). Field [[enclosure]] started in the early 16th century and although almost completed by the mid 19th century the productivity of Chesham farms provided work for over 450 agricultural labourers. Sheep that grazed on the hillside fields around Chesham provided wool for the cloth making and dying cottage industry which, due to the town's proximity to London, thrived until the 18th century when Yorkshire mills out-competed them.<ref name=\"Hunt 1977\" />\n\n===Industrial Revolution===\nUntil the 18th century the economic activity of Chesham had remained largely unchanged since the granting of its town charter in 1257. The commercial planting of [[beech]]woods established Chesham as one of a number local centres in the Chilterns for the production of turned furniture components and other wooden items often called [[bodging]], in local workshops. Mills along the Chess concerned with [[papermaking]] and [[silk|silk weaving]] continued to operate until the middle of the 19th century as did '[[outworker]]s' engaged in [[lace|lace making]] and [[straw plaiting]] whose employment was impacted on by changes in fashion, by [[mechanisation]] and from cheaper imports from the continent. The mineral-laden unpolluted water of the Chess made it ideal for growing [[watercress]] and this industry flourished in Chesham in the [[Victorian era]] and beds extended along the Chess towards [[Latimer, Buckinghamshire|Latimer]], which continued in operation until after the [[Second World War]].\n\n===Manufacturing and brewing===\nIn the 18th century, home-based leather trade workers moved to the newly opened Barnes Boot factory, and to the Britannia Boot and Shoe Works towards the end of the 19th century. By this time, there were eight major manufacturers and many small workshops. In 1829 Beechwoods [[brush]]making factory was opened. At its height there were around 12 factories specialising in brushes made from locally grown beech, with bristles imported mainly from across Asia. The adoption of nylon for brushes was the cause of the downturn with only one manufacturer remaining today, Russell's Brushes.\n\nNash's Chesham Brewery opened in the High Street in 1841. Two other notable rivals were Darvell's Brewery and Sarah Howe and Sons. Competition led to amalgamations around the start of the 20th century although brewing continued at Chesham Brewery until the 1950s.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=rglxG7g4CNgC&pg=PA252&lpg=PA252&dq=chesham+brewery&source=web&ots=pzykstbJld&sig=I5-CVnDTWB9pyNGjgcKvbVEGtbE&hl=en#PPA252,M1 Brewers in Hertfordshire \u2013 Chesham Chap 34 ]</ref>\n\n===Commerce today===\n[[File:Chesham, High Street - geograph.org.uk - 131866.jpg|thumb|Pedestrianised High Street]]\nToday Chesham has a diverse economic base comprising many typically small-medium-sized enterprises representing all business sectors. Within the two industrial parks light engineering and fabrication industry is to be found alongside printers and graphic designers or other technology-based firms, wholesalers, distribution and courier businesses. As elsewhere there has been an expansion of professional business services and consultancies. The pedestrianised High Street retains some of the character of the old market town with some long-established traditional family retailers and also features a [[street market]] on Wednesdays and Saturdays. This individuality was recognised in a survey of town 'high streets' which gave Chesham good marks for its distinctiveness.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4606587.stm Chesham rated for its High Streets's distinctiveness]</ref> There are two of the 'big five' supermarkets present which have impacted on the town's independent stores and all retail outlets have also to compete with other nearby town centres, at Amersham, [[Berkhamsted]] and [[Tring]] as well as the large shopping centres in [[High Wycombe]], [[Watford]] and Milton Keynes.\n\n==Governance==\n\n===Parliamentary representation===\n[[File:Chesham Town Hall.JPG|thumb|Chesham Town Hall]]\nThe town was part of the Aylesbury constituency from 1885 to 1974. Since the boundary changes that were made ahead of the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 general election]], Chesham has been in the [[Chesham and Amersham (UK Parliament constituency)|Chesham & Amersham constituency]]. The current constituency is solidly [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]; it has never returned a non-Tory candidate. The current MP is [[Cheryl Gillan]]. The Conservative Party won the constituency at the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 General Election]] with a 59.1% share of the vote; the next most popular party was [[UKIP]], represented by Alan Stevens, with 13.75% of the vote, [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]], Ben Davies with 12.7%, for the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] Kirsten Johnson with 9.0% and [[UK Green Party]] Gill Walker on 5.5%.  Local turnout at the last election was 71.8%.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/constituencies/E14000631 Chesham & Amersham Constituency 2015 election results BBC online], Accessed 10 May 2015</ref>\n\n===Local government===\nChesham formed part of Amersham Poor Law Union from 1835 and Amersham Rural Sanitary District from 1875. From 1884 the town was administered by the [[List of sanitary districts in Buckinghamshire|Chesham Local Government District]], which was succeeded in 1894 by [[Chesham Urban District]] under the [[Local Government Act 1894]].When the [[Local Government Act 1972]] came into effect on 1 April 1974 the urban district was abolished in favour of the [[Chiltern (district)|Chiltern district]] and the [[Civil parishes in England|civil parish]] was given [[town council]] status. At town council level, Chesham is divided into 9 electoral wards and 19 councillors. The political composition of the council as at May 2015 was: Conservative 14; Liberal Democrat 2; Labour 1; and Independent 2. A town mayor is elected by the council on an annual basis.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n===Coat of Arms===\nThe various colours of the Chesham Coat of Arms, created in 1974, are the same as those of Buckinghamshire County arms. The Chiltern woodlands are denoted by two beech trees. The river Chess is recognised in the black and white chequers and rooks. The swan is inherited from the Dukes of Buckingham. The lilies relate to St Mary, patron saint of the parish church.\nThe buck's head is borrowed from the arms of The Cavendish family, which owned most of the parish lands. The motto is from the Epistle to the Galatians, Chapter V, Verse 13.<ref>[http://www.civicheraldry.co.uk/thames_valley_chilterns.html Civic Heraldry of Thames Valley \u2013 Chesham Town] Accessed 18 September 2010</ref>\n\n==Public services==\n\n===Utilities===\n[[Veolia Water Central]] supplies [[drinking water]] to the town extracted from the River Chess and [[River Misbourne|Misbourne]] and from [[aquifers]] in the Chiltern Hills. [[Thames Water]] undertakes [[waste water]] treatment and has a [[sewage treatment|sewage treatment works]] beside the River Chess on Latimer Road to the south of the town. Chiltern District Council is responsible for [[waste management]] and collection and disposal is currently carried out on its behalf by [[Serco]]. [[EDF Energy]] provides [[Distribution Network Operator|electricity supply]] for the town.\n\n===Health services===\nBuckinghamshire [[NHS Primary Care Trust]] (PCT) has overall responsibility for provision of health services to the local community. Since the closure of the town's cottage hospital in 2004 the nearest hospitals are [[Amersham Hospital]], [[Wycombe Hospital]] and [[Stoke Mandeville Hospital]]. After several years of uncertainty, in 2008 the PCT confirmed it was proceeding with the Chesham Healthzone Project. Planning approval was granted by the District Council in June 2009 for the purpose-built health facility comprising, two GP practices, a pharmacy, consulting, clinical and treatment rooms. Originally scheduled to open in 2010, phase 1 of the Chess Medical Centre opened in December 2011.[[File:Chesham fire station - geograph.org.uk - 279721.jpg|thumb|Chesham Fire Station]]<ref>[http://chesham.buckinghamshireadvertiser.co.uk/2009/06/thumbs-up-for-chesham-healthzo.html Thumbs up for Chesham Healthzone Bucks Examiner June 12 2009]{{Dead link|date=November 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Retrieved, 14 June 2009</ref><ref>[http://www.buckspct.nhs.uk/?page_id=158 Chesham Healthzone project \u2013 Bucks NHS PCT] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722154333/http://www.buckspct.nhs.uk/?page_id=158 |date=22 July 2011 }} Retrieved, 19 May 2009</ref><ref>[http://chesham.buckinghamshireadvertiser.co.uk/2011/12/cheshams-healthzone-to-open-it.html Chesham's Healthzone to open its doors this month Bucks Examiner 02-12-2011] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405143124/http://chesham.buckinghamshireadvertiser.co.uk/2011/12/cheshams-healthzone-to-open-it.html |date=5 April 2012 }} Retrieved, 6 December 2011</ref>\n\n===Emergency services===\n[[Thames Valley Police]] headquartered in [[Kidlington]], Oxfordshire is accountable for delivery of policing through the town's three [[Neighbourhood Policing Team]]s. [[Buckinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service]] based in Aylesbury oversees the town's fire and rescue services. There is a [[fire station]] located in Bellingdon Road which is supplemented by services from the station at Amersham and other nearby towns. Ambulance services are managed by [[South Central Ambulance Service|South Central Ambulance Service NHS Trust]] based in [[Bicester]], [[Oxford]]. The nearest [[ambulance station]] for the town is located in Amersham.\n\n==Religion==\n[[File:Chesham, The Salvation Army Hall, Broad Street - geograph.org.uk - 131890.jpg|thumb|Salvation Army Citadel]]\nThe oldest church building in Chesham is [[St. Mary's Church, Chesham|St. Mary's Church]] which dates from at least the 12th century. Chesham has a long history of religious [[dissent]], such as the persecuted [[Lollardy|Lollards]], followers of the [[John Wycliffe]] tradition.  One of them [[Thomas Harding]] was martyred on White Hill, near Dungrove Farm, in 1532. There is a memorial to local Lollards in [[Amersham]], and memorials to Thomas Harding in the churchyard and on White Hill.  The 17th, 18th and 19th centuries saw the rapid growth of [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|non-conformism]] especially [[Baptists]].  During the civil war there were groups of Quakers, Baptists and Presbyterians.  Broadway Baptist Church dates back to at least 1706 and had its 300th anniversary celebrations in Chesham in 2006.  Its roots are in the Chesham and Berkhamsted Baptist Church which dates back to 1640.\n[[File:Chesham Mosque.jpg|thumb|Chesham Mosque]]\nIn the present day, Chesham has four Baptist churches (Broadway Baptist, Trinity Baptist and Newtown Baptist) and four [[Anglican]] churches (St Mary's, Christ Church in Waterside, Hope Church, formerly called Hiving's Free Church, in Upper Belmont Road and Emmanuel in Newtown). There is a [[United Reformed Church]], formerly called the Congregational Church, in The Broadway, there was a [[Gospel Hall]] in Station Road (which closed at the end of 2008), a [[Roman Catholic]] church (St Columba's) in Berkhampstead Road (built in 1960), a [[Methodist]] chapel in Bellingdon Road, a [[Salvation Army]] Citadel in Broad St (closed in 2015), an historic [[Quaker]] [[Friends Meeting House]] in Bellingdon Road, The King's Church charismatic fellowship which meets at Chesham Park Community College.  Almost all of the Christian churches of Chesham work collectively as part of the Churches Together for Chesham (CTfC) group, which has 16 churches in membership.  Other religious groups include Chesham [[Spiritualist Church]] in Higham Road and the Jehovah's Witnesses off Bellingdon Road.\n\nDuring the Second World War, the first recorded Jewish congregation was founded on families evacuated from London who used to meet at the cricket pavilion.  After the war they combined with the Jewish community in Amersham which met at the synagogue in Amersham-on-the-Hill until 1968. This was succeeded by a [[Liberal Judaism (United Kingdom)|Liberal Judaism]] community formed in 1990 which now meets at Chesham Grammar School.<ref>[http://www.jewishgen.org/JCR-UK/community/chiltern.htm Chiltern Jewish Community website], Retrieved 18 May 2009</ref>\n\nDuring the second half of the 20th century, a [[Muslim]] community became established in the town. [[Chesham Mosque]] the first purpose-built mosque was completed in 2005 and is located in Bellingdon Road.\n\n==Demography==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"float:right; line-height:1.1em; border:1px #000; margin-left:0; text-align:right;\"\n|-\n!

The [[stage coach]] bypassed the town and, unlike Amersham, there were no turnpikes and consequently roads were poorly maintained. Significant change occurred in the post Second World War period with the opening of the [[M1 motorway]]. The [[A416 road (Great Britain)|A416]] now runs through the town, from Amersham to [[Berkhamsted]], and connects the town to the more recently upgraded [[A41 road|A41]]. The A416 was diverted around the High Street and later upgraded to be dual-lane. Although these improvements enable more through traffic, traffic congestion has increased. Chesham's High Street was [[pedestrianisation|pedestrianised]] in 1990 and the benefits to the High Street have been felt ever since. Whilst some of the previous bustle has been lost, the impact of pedestrianisation has generally been positive.\n\n===Rail===\n[[File:Chesham Tube Station.jpg|thumb|Chesham tube station]]\n[[Chesham tube station]], close to the town centre, is the [[Terminal station|terminus]] for the [[Chesham branch]], a single track spur off the London Underground Metropolitan line connecting to [[Chalfont and Latimer station]]. The station was opened on 8 July 1889 by the [[Metropolitan Railway]] (MR). The line had been intended to extend to [[Tring railway station]] with connections to the [[London and North Western Railway]]{{'}}s [[West Coast Main Line]]. However, before work was begun, the MR chose an alternative route across the Chilterns. The idea was abandoned and the Metropolitan line reached Amersham and [[Aylesbury]]. There were some sizeable goods yards beyond the station, which were closed and now function as [[Waitrose]]'s car park except for one portion occupied by a coal merchants.\n\nIn 1959 electrification of the Metropolitan line to Chesham provided a more reliable connection to London. Following the cessation of London Underground services to Aylesbury in 1961 and the closure of [[Ongar tube station|Ongar]] in 1994, Chesham has become the furthest location served from central London, in terms of both distance and travelling time. Prior to December 2010, apart from a few direct trains to London at peak times, a shuttle service operated to and from Chalfont and Latimer station. Since then the town has benefited from direct trains to London all day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chilternvoice.co.uk/2010/12/01/last-chesham-shuttle-before-the-through-trains/|title=Last Chesham Shuttle Before the Through Trains|work=Chiltern Voice|accessdate=9 December 2010|location=Chesham|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722181721/http://www.chilternvoice.co.uk/2010/12/01/last-chesham-shuttle-before-the-through-trains/|archivedate=22 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe nearest [[National Rail]] connections are [[Amersham station]], although the LU line also connects directly to [[Chalfont & Latimer station]], from where the Metropolitan line and National Rail [[Chiltern Railways]] provide a joint service with Metropolitan line trains travelling to [[Baker Street]] station and Chiltern Railways trains travelling to [[Marylebone station]]. There is also access to London via [[Berkhamsted railway station]] on the [[West Coast Main Line]].\n\n===Bus services===\nBus companies running local services include [[Arriva Shires & Essex|Arriva]], [[Carousel Buses]], Red Rose, Redline and Red Eagle.\n\nResidential areas of the town are connected with the central shopping-area. Chesham is also connected by services to nearby Amersham, and further afield to [[High Wycombe]], [[Hemel Hempstead]], and Uxbridge.<ref>\nThe main service in Chesham is the route 1/1A operated by Arriva and Carousel. It connects the Pond Park estate to Chesham Town Centre and on to Amersham, Holmer Green, Hazlemere, and High Wycombe, serving the Eden Bus Station.\nCarousel Buses also operate the \"Chiltern Hundreds\" service 105 travelling through Chesham on its way from Hemel Hempstead, Bovingdon and Lye Green, on to Amersham, the Chalfonts, Gerrards Cross, Denham and Uxbridge.\n[http://www.buckscc.gov.uk/bcc/transport/Changes_to_bus_services_in_Chesham_and_Amersham.page?

[[William the Conqueror]] shared out the estates between four of his dependants. The vast majority of land was granted to Hugh de Bolebec and smaller parcels to [[Odo, Bishop of Bayeux]], Toustain Mantel and Alsi.<ref name=\"RoBVol3\" />\n\nBefore the 13th century the three Cestreham manors were known as Chesham Higham, Chesham Bury and Chesham Boys (or 'Bois'). In the 14th century they were first recorded as 'the manors of Great Chesham'. Collectively they extended beyond the current Chesham town boundary.<ref name=\"RoBVol3\" /> Together with the manor at Latimer they were held by the [[Earl of Oxford|Earls of Oxford]] and [[Earl of Surrey|Surrey]]. During the 16th century Greater Chesham was owned by the [[Seymour family]] who disposed of it to the Cavendish family who were [[Earl of Devonshire|the Earls and later Dukes of Devonshire]]. It is from the 15th century that the earliest surviving properties survive and are to be found close by the church in an area called ''the Nap'', and along part of the present-day Church Street. Though gradually disposing of land the Cavendishes maintained an influence in the town until the 19th century. The Lowndes family started purchasing land from the 16th century. [[William Lowndes (British politician)|William Lowndes]] was an influential politician and [[Secretary to the Treasury]] during the reigns of [[Mary II of England|Mary II]], [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]]. He rebuilt the original Bury and [[manor house]] of Great Chesham in 1712. The Lowndes family settled in Chesham and over the next 200 years became equally influential both nationally through politics and the law and locally within the town as its principal benefactors.<ref name=\"Hunt 1977\" />\n\n===Ecclesiastical history===\nNo evidence remains of any church prior to the Norman Conquest. However, the siting of [[Hertfordshire puddingstone|puddingstones]] beneath the present-day church suggests a wooden church was constructed on the site during the Anglo-Saxon period. During the 12th century two families of Norman descent, the de Bolebecs and the Sifrewasts, each held a share of the [[advowson]] assigned to the adjacent manors of Chesham Higham and Chesham Bury respectively for the Church at Chesham which it is evidenced from about 1154 was dedicated to St Mary.<ref>{{Citation|first1=Shirley|last1=Foxell|first2=Clive|last2=Foxell|title=St Mary's Church, Chesham|year=2004|publisher=Clive Foxell|place=Chesham|isbn=0-9529184-4-7|ref=harv}}</ref> These moieties were subsequently given by the families to two [[monastery|monasteries]]. In 1194 the de Bolbecs bestowed their advowson to the abbot and monks of [[Woburn Abbey]] and henceforth the parish of Chesham Higham was renamed 'Chesham Woburn'. Meanwhile, and sometime before 1199, the Sifrewast family granted their advowson to the [[convent]] of St Mary's de Pr\u00e9 Leicester. As a consequence the advowson for the parish of Chesham Bury became known as 'Chesham Leicester'.<ref name=\"BHOChesham\">[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=42547 British History online Chesham], Retrieved 14 June 2013</ref> In 1536 [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] seized control of church property as part of the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]]. Subsequently, during [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]] and [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]'s reigns, first Chesham Woburn and then Chesham Leicester advowsons became part of the estates of the [[Dukes of Bedford]]. Though there were originally two vicars appointed to the [[St. Mary's Church, Chesham|parish church of St Mary's]] from the 17th century a single [[Incumbent (ecclesiastical)|incumbent]] was appointed.

In 1532 [[Thomas Harding]] was [[burnt at the stake]] in the town for being a [[Lollard]] and [[heresy|heretic]]. From the 17th century Chesham was a focus for [[English Dissenters|those dissenting from mainstream religion]]. [[Quaker]]s met in the late 17th century in Chesham and in 1798 they built the current [[Friends meeting house|meeting house]]. The first [[Baptists]]' meeting dates back to about 1640 and a place was registered for services in 1706. The first chapel was opened in 1712, one of many to be built for the various Baptist groups during the 18th and 19th centuries. [[John Wesley]] preached in Chesham in the 1760s and a Wesleyan [[Methodist]] society existed in the town. In more recent time a [[Methodist Church of Great Britain|Wesleyan Methodist]] chapel was opened in 1897. The [[Christian Brethren]] which date back in Chesham to 1876, opened their Gospel Hall in 1895, which closed in December 2008.  Broadway Baptist church had branches at the Vale, Hawridge, Ashley Green and Chartridge; only the one at Chartridge survives.  Trinity Baptist church had branches at Hyde Heath, Ley Hill and Whelpley Hill; only the one at Hyde Heath survives.  The Congregational Church had branches at Asheridge and Pond Park.\n\n===Emigration to the American colonies===\nIn 1630 Aquila Chase left Chesham to join the colony, settling first at Hampton (now New Hampshire), then [[Newbury, Massachusetts]]. Descendants of Aquila became influential in shaping political, legislative and commercial matters from the colonial period until after the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. For example, [[Salmon P. Chase]] was the United States Treasury Secretary and Chief Justice in the 1870s. The [[Chase Manhattan Bank]] is named after him (although Chase did not have any connection with the bank).<ref>[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/JP-Morgan-Chase-amp;-Co-Company-History.html History of Chase Manhattan Bank], Retrieved 12 May 2009</ref><ref>[http://www.politicalfamilytree.com/samples%20content/members/chief_justices/Chase-OH-1.pdf Genealogy of Chase family], Retrieved 12 May 2009</ref>\n\n===Industrial development===\nThe primary industries of the town in [[medieval]] times were flour production, woodworking and weaving of wool. There were four mills built along the Chess which was diverted to generate sufficient power. Surplus flour was supplied to London. The number of clothworkers, including spinners and those associated with dying ([[fuller (disambiguation)|fuller]]s), grew rapidly between 1530 and 1730 and became the major industry in the town prior to a period of rapid decline. Between 1740 and 1798 mills were converted to produce paper (pulp) responding to London's insatiable demand for paper. However, technological developments in paper-making elsewhere rendered the mills unprofitable and they reverted to flour production in the 1850s.\n[[File:Chesham Town picture.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Painting of Chesham town, circa 1750]]\nNew industries emerged from the 16th century onwards. The woodlands had been a source of firewood for London during the mediaeval period. A small-scale woodenware industry; making shovels, brooms, spoons and chairs, began around 1538 and its expansion was accompanied by the planting of beechwoods between 17th and 19th centuries.<ref name=\"Hunt 1977\" /> [[Straw plaiting]] was seen as home-based work for the wives and daughters of labourers from the 18th century. Straw was also imported from Italy to produce the superior 'Tuscan plait' traded at a Saturday market for the [[Luton]] and [[Dunstable]] hat trade and remained the major cottage industry until around 1860, providing employment for women and girls some of whom attended a 'plait-school' in [[Waterside, Buckinghamshire|Waterside]].<ref name=\"Hunt 1977\" /> [[Lace]] making developed in the 16th century as a cottage industry and was valued for its quality. Chesham specialised in black lace. The industry declined in the 1850s due to mechanisation in [[Nottingham]].<ref name=\"Hunt 1977\" /> Between 1838 and 1864 silk-spinning, powered by a steam-driven mill in Waterside was started to make use of unemployed lace workers. This trend was relatively short-lived as changes in fashion and the growth of the railways resulted in competition from elsewhere for the valuable London markets.<ref name=\"Hunt 1977\" /> However one exception was the firm of George Tutill, which specialised in high-quality [[Banner-making|banners]] and was responsible for three-quarters of those made for trade unions. The firm is still a going concern still specialising in flags and banners.\n\nThree of the four Bs that have shaped Chesham's history relate to its industries. '''Brush''' making was introduced around 1829 to make use of the off-cuts from woodworking. '''Boot''' and shoe making which started as a [[cottage industry]] later expanding through small workshops thrived following the opening of [[tanneries]] around 1792 which also supplied leather for [[saddle]] making and [[gloves|glove]]. By the mid-19th century both brushmaking and footwear manufacture became major industries in the town with production concentrated in large factories. The industry declined in the early-20th century as the market for heavy boots declined. '''Beer''' brewing grew rapidly around the town centre in the 19th century again declining at the start of the 20th century.<ref name=\"Hunt 1977\" /> These traditional industries were succeeded by smaller but more commercial enterprises which took advantage of the available skilled labour. For example, in 1908 the Chiltern Toy Works was opened by Joseph Eisenmann on Bellingdon Road, later moving to the 'new' industrial estate in Waterside, making high quality [[teddy bears]]. The works finally closed in 1960.<ref>[http://www.luckybears.com/encyclopaedia_chiltern.asp Chiltern Teddy Bear factory]</ref> Post Second World War industry has ranged from the manufacture of glue ([[Adhesive|Industrial Adhesives]]) to aluminium-based packaging ([[Alcan]]), Aluminium Castings & Bronze Castings (Draycast Foundries Limited) and [[balloon]]s (B-Loony).\n\n===The town in times of war===\n[[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] imposed a tax on the town to pay for his wars against Scotland and France.\n\nIn common with the majority of communities in Buckinghamshire, Chesham's [[Lollard]] heritage and [[puritan]] traditions ensured it would vehemently resist [[King Charles I of England|King Charles I]]'s demand for [[Ship Money]]; a tax on tradesmen and landowners. In 1635 the townsfolk of Chesham protested to the Sheriff of Buckinghamshire, Sir Peter Temple, who was reluctantly enforcing a writ requiring payment of a levy to the King. Not surprisingly given the local allegiances to [[John Hampden]], the towns' people largely sided with the [[Roundheads|Parliamentarians]] at the outbreak of the [[English Civil War]]. During 1642 the influential Parliamentarians [[John Pym]] and [[Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick|Earl of Warwick]] were headquartered in the town along with large numbers of troops. There are records of skirmishes in the area during 1643 when [[Prince Rupert]] was stationed near Aylesbury and dispatched [[Robert Dormer, 1st Earl of Carnarvon]] to pillage nearby towns, such as [[Wendover]]. Heading toward Chesham a company of horse of the Parliamentary Army from the town met them outside Great Missenden where a skirmish took place ending with the Parliamentary force being driven back.<ref name=\"RoBVol3\" />\n\nThe records of the [[Posse comitatus (common law)|Posse Comitatus]] for Chesham in 1798 recorded over 800 men between the ages of 16\u201360 enrolled in a militia to defend the town in the event of invasion by [[Napoleon I]] or to deal with civil unrest. Less than 50 years later, in 1846 a similar register of 22 able-bodied men had been assembled to form the Chesham troop of the [[Royal Buckinghamshire Yeomanry]] which coincided with the billeting of troops from the [[7th Hussars|Queen's Own 7th Hussars]] passing through the town on their way to Ireland.<ref name=\"Birch 1997\">{{cite book |last=Birch|first=Clive|title=The Book of Chesham |year=1997 |publisher=Quotes Limited |location=England |isbn=0-86023-641-2}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[First World War]] 188 servicemen from Chesham lost their lives (see Landmarks). [[Alfred Alexander Burt|Alfred Burt]] a corporal in the [[Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Regiment]] from Chesham received the [[Victoria Cross]] for his actions in September 1915. The town provided temporary quarters for several regiments including the [[King's Royal Rifle Corps|Kings Royal Rifles]] and the [[Royal Engineers]] honed their bridge building skills in local parks. Over the duration of the [[Second World War]] 80 servicemen lost their lives. Air raid shelters were built by the Council in 1940 although the official view was that the not being a strategic location the town was unlikely to be targeted. In fact at the end of the war it was estimated that 45 bombs fell in the Chesham area and it is known that nine people were killed.<ref>{{cite book |last=Baines, Arnold &|first=Birch, Clive|title=Chesham Century |year=1994 |publisher=Quotes Limited |location=England |isbn=0-86023-549-1}}</ref>\n\n===Social history===\nA Chesham [[workhouse]] for 90 paupers was operating in Germain Street as early as 1777. New legislation transferred the control of the Chesham institution to Amersham [[Poor Law Union]] in 1835. However, there were long-standing rivalries between the locals of both towns and in July that year violence broke out when an order was given to remove the paupers to Amersham. The [[Riot Act]] was read out to an angry crowd of 500 and arrests followed.<ref>[http://www.workhouses.org.uk/index.html?Amersham/Amersham.shtml Times reports riots outside Chesham Workhouse]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605224359/http://www.workhouses.org.uk/index.html?Amersham%2FAmersham.shtml |date=5 June 2011 }}</ref>\n\nPublicly funded education started with the opening of a [[British and Foreign School Society|British School]] in 1825 followed by a [[national school (England and Wales)|National School]] in 1845, an [[Infant school|Infants' Schoo]]l in 1851 and the first Elementary School for girls in 1864.

Complaints that it had become a nuisance led to the Urban District Council surrounding the site with a concrete wall. This further increased its popularity and an open-air pool was built by the council in 1912.<ref>{{cite news |title=Editorial |url=http://content.yudu.com/Library/A1wnak/yourCheshamissue28/resources/index.htm?referrerUrl=http%3A%2F%2Ffree.yudu.com%2Fitem%2Fdetails%2F518107%2FyourChesham-issue-28%3Frefid%3D44057  |newspaper=yourChesham |date=May 2012 |accessdate=7 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nTransport connections have always come late to the town. The [[Metropolitan Railway]] eventually reached Chesham in July 1889. Electrification was not to come until the 1960s.

The first purpose-built cinema, ''The Empire Picture Hall'', opened in Station Road in 1912 and in 1914 ''The Chesham Palace'' started up in The Broadway. Both showed silent films. By 1920 the Empire had closed. In 1930 the Chesham Palace was refurbished to show the new 'talkies' and reopened as ''The Astoria'' which remained in business until 1959 when the arrival of television forced it to close. ''The Embassy'' in Germain Street opened in 1935 and survived until 1982, closing due to competition from cinemas in nearby towns. ''The Elgiva Theatre'', completed in 1976 beside St Mary's Way, was equipped to show films and on moving to a new site just across the road in 1998 state of the art projection equipment was installed in the new theatre (see image below).<ref>{{Cite book |last=Foxell|first=Clive |title=The Ten Cinemas of Chesham|year=2010 |publisher=Clive Foxell |location=Chesham England |isbn=978-0-9564178-0-0}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nThe town is in the Chess Valley 13 miles south-east of the county town [[Aylesbury]] and is 25 miles (40&nbsp;km) north west of central London.

Industrial buildings on the north side of the town have been redeveloped into offices in recent years.<ref name=\"CDCcorestrategy\">[http://www.chiltern.gov.uk/corestrategy/downloads/Chiltern_District_Core_Strategy_Submission_Document_Jan_2011.pdf Core Strategy for Chiltern District Chiltern District Council January 2011] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722192308/http://www.chiltern.gov.uk/corestrategy/downloads/Chiltern_District_Core_Strategy_Submission_Document_Jan_2011.pdf |date=22 July 2011 }}, Retrieved 28_05_2011</ref>\n\nThe town had a population of 2,425 by 1841.<ref>''The National Cyclopaedia of Useful Knowledge, Vol.III'', (1847), London, Charles Knight, p.898</ref> This had increased to more to 9,000 by the end of the 19th century. As a consequence the centre of the town shifted to the east as shops, workshops and cottages sprung up along the High Street and Berkhampstead Road.  In the period after the [[Second World War]] the town centre was progressively redeveloped. In the 1960s St Mary's Way was constructed, rerouting the [[A416 road|A416]] around the congested High Street which avoided the need to widen the street, conserved its character and allowed for its pedestrianisation during the 1990s. Industrial development became centred on two areas. At the southern end of the town at [[Waterside, Buckinghamshire|Waterside]] which was the site of the first mills and factories in the 18th and 19th centuries there is a mixture of original and newly constructed industrial units and at the northern end along the Asheridge Vale there is a further development of generally small commercial business units.\n\nCompared to other towns in south Buckinghamshire, there are fewer detached and owner-occupied houses and a higher proportion of social rental accommodation.<ref name=\"CDCcorestrategy\" /> Expansion in housing has occurred in several phases mainly to the east of the old town where [[artisan]]'s housing sprung up along Berkhamsted Road and subsequently along the many steep valley sides. Initially this development was as a consequence of the extension of the railway to the town in the 1880s, subsequently the promotion of [[Metro-land|Metroland]] during the 1920s and the electrification of the [[Metropolitan line]] in the 1960s. Pond Park estate was built in the 1930s. The population grew fast after the Second World War as workers followed employers who moved out from London. The population in 1951 was 11,500 leading to the building of the Chessmount and Hilltop estates by speculative developers in the 1950s and '60s.  By 1971 the population had reached 20,000 since when it has only increased slightly. The growing popularity of the Chilterns as a place to live from the latter part of the 20th century onwards led to restrictions on housing and industrial development in the Chilterns [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]] and has sustained the demand for further house building in the town. Today an increasing number of those in employment find work outside the town, commuting by car or train as well as an increasing number who are home or office-based using technology to make a living.\n\n===Climate===\nChesham experiences an [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Cfb'') similar to almost all of the United Kingdom, although the lower parts of the valley have significant frost hollow characteristics \u2013 being several degrees colder than surrounding areas on clear, calm nights and so have much lower average minimum temperatures than shown in the table. The lowest recorded temperature in Chesham was {{convert|-19.6|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} on 20 December 2010 at a private weather station, which was also the coldest place in the UK on that date.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-12038023|title=Buckinghamshire records lowest UK overnight temperature|date=20 December 2010|work=bbc.co.uk|publisher=BBC Beds, Herts and Bucks|accessdate=20 December 2010}}</ref> On 12 February 2012, the coldest day in Britain since December 2010, temperatures in Chesham fell to {{convert|-18.3|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} again the lowest in the country on that date.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/topics/weather/9077284/Cold-snap-to-finally-end-after-record-breaking-sub-zero-temperatures.html|title=CCold snap to finally end after record-breaking sub-zero temperatures|date=12 February 2012|work=telegraph.co.uk|publisher=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=12 February 2012}}</ref>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n{{Weather box\n|location =Chesham\n|metric first =Yes\n|single line =Yes\n|Jan high C =8\n|Feb high C =9\n|Mar high C =12\n|Apr high C =14\n|May high C =18\n|Jun high C =21\n|Jul high C =23\n|Aug high C =23\n|Sep high C =20\n|Oct high C =16\n|Nov high C =11\n|Dec high C =8\n|year high C =\n|Jan low C =2\n|Feb low C =3\n|Mar low C =4\n|Apr low C =5\n|May low C =8\n|Jun low C =11\n|Jul low C =13\n|Aug low C =13\n|Sep low C =10\n|Oct low C =7\n|Nov low C =4\n|Dec low C =3\n|year low C =\n|Jan precipitation mm =50.8\n|Feb precipitation mm =44.4\n|Mar precipitation mm =42.9\n|Apr precipitation mm =51.1\n|May precipitation mm =51.7\n|Jun precipitation mm =46.1\n|Jul precipitation mm =43.9\n|Aug precipitation mm =74.9\n|Sep precipitation mm =50.1\n|Oct precipitation mm =66.8\n|Nov precipitation mm =61.8\n|Dec precipitation mm =57.5\n|year precipitation mm =\n\n|source 1 =World Weather Online<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.worldweatheronline.com/Chesham-weather-averages/Buckinghamshire/GB.aspx | title = World Weather Online Averages for Chesham 2007\u201308| publisher =  }} [[MSN]] Retrieved 16 March 2013</ref>\n|date=December 2012\n}}\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n===Neighbourhoods and wards===\nThe town comprises the following communities:\n* '''Asheridge Vale''', stretches along Asheridge Road on the north-west edge of the town. The large housing development was built during the mid 20th century along with an industrial estate comprising manufacturing and light industrial units which has since undergone diversification into offices and small businesses. Also a town council [[Wards of the United Kingdom|ward]].\n* '''[[Botley, Buckinghamshire|Botley]]''', a [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]] located to the east of the town of Chesham between Lye Green and [[Ley Hill]] (the latter in [[Latimer, Buckinghamshire|Latimer parish]]). Part of Townsend ward.\n* '''[[Chesham Vale]]''', area on the northern edge of the town on the road to the villages of [[Hawridge]] and [[Cholesbury]]. Also a town council ward called '''Vale'''.\n* '''Chessmount''', area to the east of the town centre. Part of Waterside ward.\n* '''Codmore''', ancient hamlet located to the north-east of the town centre, at the junction between the roads to Lye Green and Botley. Part of Hilltop ward.\n* '''Great Hivings''', an area to the north of Chesham on the road to [[Bellingdon]] (the latter in [[Chartridge|Chartridge parish]]). Part of the ward called '''Ridgeway'''.\n* '''Hilltop''', residential area to the north-east of the town built on steeply sloping ground. The estate, built in 1958 following the decision to extend the Metropolitan line. Consists primarily of steel framed bungalows, many of which were originally purchased by west Londoners. Also the name of a town council ward.\n* '''[[Lye Green]]''', hamlet located to the north east of the main town. Part of Newtown ward.\n* '''Lowndes''', residential area which includes the Chiltern Hills Academy School, close to the centre of the town, adjacent to Lowndes Park. Also a town council ward.\n[[File:River Chess at Waterside, Chesham - geograph.org.uk - 407585.jpg|thumb|Waterside and [[River Chess]]]]\n* '''Newtown''', late Victorian housing development to the north of the town, now incorporated into the enlarged townscape. Also a town council ward.\n* '''Old Town''', until the arrival of the Metropolitan Railway in the 19th century was the town's centre. Today, St Mary's Church, the historic houses and streetscape are part of a designated Conservation Area lying to the south of the present town centre with which it comprises '''St. Mary's''' ward.\n* '''Pednormead End''', an area to the west of the main town, along Missenden Road. Part of St. Mary's ward.\n* '''[[Pond Park]]''', an area comprising post Second World War housing to the north of the town. Part of the Ridgeway Ward.\n* '''Townsend''', Victorian extension to the town comprising commercial premises, later 20th century residential developments and Chesham Grammar School.  Also a town council ward.\n* '''[[Waterside, Buckinghamshire|Waterside]]''', once a hamlet located just south of the town centre. Several mills sprung up along the River Chess which flows through the area as well as factories. It still retains a distinct character with a large open space known as the Moor. Also a town council ward.\n[[File:Chesham War Memorial.jpg|thumb|125px|Chesham War Memorial]]\n\n==Landmarks==\n\n===Clock tower===\nA [[clock tower]] constructed in 1992 stands in Market Square on the site of Chesham's 18th-century town hall demolished in 1965. The turret is a reconstruction of the one built onto the original town hall in the 19th century and features the original glass-dialled clock face and clock mechanism from the mid 19th century.<ref>[http://www.chesham.gov.uk/Open_Spaces/Clock_Tower.aspx Chesham Town Clock Tower]</ref>\n\n===War memorial===\nChesham [[war memorial]] stands in a landscaped garden in the Broadway. It depicts an [[infantryman]] with his rifle inverted and commemorates those who fell during the [[First World War|First]] and [[Second World War]]s. It was designed by the sculptor [[Arthur George Walker]] and unveiled in 1921. The inscription reads:- ''To The Glorious Memory Of The Men Of The Town Who Gave Their Lives And To Honour:'' ''All Who Served Or Suffered In Cause Of God King And Country Their Deeds Live After Them Faithful Unto Death''.<ref>[http://www.roll-of-honour.com/Buckinghamshire/Chesham.html Chesham War Memorial and Roll of Honour]</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n\n===Agriculture===\nThere is evidence during the pre-Norman period of common fields divided into parcels and strips of land. The [[Domesday Book]] records Chesham with sufficient arable land to support four [[Water wheel|water-powered]] [[corn mill]]s on the River Chess producing a surplus of flour exported to London. There was woodland to feed over 1600 pigs and supply timber for local manufacturing of farm tools (ploughshares). Field [[enclosure]] started in the early 16th century and although almost completed by the mid 19th century the productivity of Chesham farms provided work for over 450 agricultural labourers. Sheep that grazed on the hillside fields around Chesham provided wool for the cloth making and dying cottage industry which, due to the town's proximity to London, thrived until the 18th century when Yorkshire mills out-competed them.<ref name=\"Hunt 1977\" />\n\n===Industrial Revolution===\nUntil the 18th century the economic activity of Chesham had remained largely unchanged since the granting of its town charter in 1257. The commercial planting of [[beech]]woods established Chesham as one of a number local centres in the Chilterns for the production of turned furniture components and other wooden items often called [[bodging]], in local workshops. Mills along the Chess concerned with [[papermaking]] and [[silk|silk weaving]] continued to operate until the middle of the 19th century as did '[[outworker]]s' engaged in [[lace|lace making]] and [[straw plaiting]] whose employment was impacted on by changes in fashion, by [[mechanisation]] and from cheaper imports from the continent. The mineral-laden unpolluted water of the Chess made it ideal for growing [[watercress]] and this industry flourished in Chesham in the [[Victorian era]] and beds extended along the Chess towards [[Latimer, Buckinghamshire|Latimer]], which continued in operation until after the [[Second World War]].\n\n===Manufacturing and brewing===\nIn the 18th century, home-based leather trade workers moved to the newly opened Barnes Boot factory, and to the Britannia Boot and Shoe Works towards the end of the 19th century. By this time, there were eight major manufacturers and many small workshops. In 1829 Beechwoods [[brush]]making factory was opened. At its height there were around 12 factories specialising in brushes made from locally grown beech, with bristles imported mainly from across Asia. The adoption of nylon for brushes was the cause of the downturn with only one manufacturer remaining today, Russell's Brushes.\n\nNash's Chesham Brewery opened in the High Street in 1841. Two other notable rivals were Darvell's Brewery and Sarah Howe and Sons. Competition led to amalgamations around the start of the 20th century although brewing continued at Chesham Brewery until the 1950s.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=rglxG7g4CNgC&pg=PA252&lpg=PA252&dq=chesham+brewery&source=web&ots=pzykstbJld&sig=I5-CVnDTWB9pyNGjgcKvbVEGtbE&hl=en#PPA252,M1 Brewers in Hertfordshire \u2013 Chesham Chap 34 ]</ref>\n\n===Commerce today===\n[[File:Chesham, High Street - geograph.org.uk - 131866.jpg|thumb|Pedestrianised High Street]]\nToday Chesham has a diverse economic base comprising many typically small-medium-sized enterprises representing all business sectors. Within the two industrial parks light engineering and fabrication industry is to be found alongside printers and graphic designers or other technology-based firms, wholesalers, distribution and courier businesses. As elsewhere there has been an expansion of professional business services and consultancies. The pedestrianised High Street retains some of the character of the old market town with some long-established traditional family retailers and also features a [[street market]] on Wednesdays and Saturdays. This individuality was recognised in a survey of town 'high streets' which gave Chesham good marks for its distinctiveness.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4606587.stm Chesham rated for its High Streets's distinctiveness]</ref> There are two of the 'big five' supermarkets present which have impacted on the town's independent stores and all retail outlets have also to compete with other nearby town centres, at Amersham, [[Berkhamsted]] and [[Tring]] as well as the large shopping centres in [[High Wycombe]], [[Watford]] and Milton Keynes.\n\n==Governance==\n\n===Parliamentary representation===\n[[File:Chesham Town Hall.JPG|thumb|Chesham Town Hall]]\nThe town was part of the Aylesbury constituency from 1885 to 1974. Since the boundary changes that were made ahead of the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 general election]], Chesham has been in the [[Chesham and Amersham (UK Parliament constituency)|Chesham & Amersham constituency]]. The current constituency is solidly [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]; it has never returned a non-Tory candidate. The current MP is [[Cheryl Gillan]]. The Conservative Party won the constituency at the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 General Election]] with a 59.1% share of the vote; the next most popular party was [[UKIP]], represented by Alan Stevens, with 13.75% of the vote, [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]], Ben Davies with 12.7%, for the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] Kirsten Johnson with 9.0% and [[UK Green Party]] Gill Walker on 5.5%.

From 1884 the town was administered by the [[List of sanitary districts in Buckinghamshire|Chesham Local Government District]], which was succeeded in 1894 by [[Chesham Urban District]] under the [[Local Government Act 1894]].When the [[Local Government Act 1972]] came into effect on 1 April 1974 the urban district was abolished in favour of the [[Chiltern (district)|Chiltern district]] and the [[Civil parishes in England|civil parish]] was given [[town council]] status. At town council level, Chesham is divided into 9 electoral wards and 19 councillors. The political composition of the council as at May 2015 was: Conservative 14; Liberal Democrat 2; Labour 1; and Independent 2. A town mayor is elected by the council on an annual basis.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n===Coat of Arms===\nThe various colours of the Chesham Coat of Arms, created in 1974, are the same as those of Buckinghamshire County arms. The Chiltern woodlands are denoted by two beech trees. The river Chess is recognised in the black and white chequers and rooks. The swan is inherited from the Dukes of Buckingham. The lilies relate to St Mary, patron saint of the parish church.\nThe buck's head is borrowed from the arms of The Cavendish family, which owned most of the parish lands. The motto is from the Epistle to the Galatians, Chapter V, Verse 13.<ref>[http://www.civicheraldry.co.uk/thames_valley_chilterns.html Civic Heraldry of Thames Valley \u2013 Chesham Town] Accessed 18 September 2010</ref>\n\n==Public services==\n\n===Utilities===\n[[Veolia Water Central]] supplies [[drinking water]] to the town extracted from the River Chess and [[River Misbourne|Misbourne]] and from [[aquifers]] in the Chiltern Hills. [[Thames Water]] undertakes [[waste water]] treatment and has a [[sewage treatment|sewage treatment works]] beside the River Chess on Latimer Road to the south of the town. Chiltern District Council is responsible for [[waste management]] and collection and disposal is currently carried out on its behalf by [[Serco]]. [[EDF Energy]] provides [[Distribution Network Operator|electricity supply]] for the town.\n\n===Health services===\nBuckinghamshire [[NHS Primary Care Trust]] (PCT) has overall responsibility for provision of health services to the local community. Since the closure of the town's cottage hospital in 2004 the nearest hospitals are [[Amersham Hospital]], [[Wycombe Hospital]] and [[Stoke Mandeville Hospital]]. After several years of uncertainty, in 2008 the PCT confirmed it was proceeding with the Chesham Healthzone Project. Planning approval was granted by the District Council in June 2009 for the purpose-built health facility comprising, two GP practices, a pharmacy, consulting, clinical and treatment rooms. Originally scheduled to open in 2010, phase 1 of the Chess Medical Centre opened in December 2011.[[File:Chesham fire station - geograph.org.uk - 279721.jpg|thumb|Chesham Fire Station]]<ref>[http://chesham.buckinghamshireadvertiser.co.uk/2009/06/thumbs-up-for-chesham-healthzo.html Thumbs up for Chesham Healthzone Bucks Examiner June 12 2009]{{Dead link|date=November 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Retrieved, 14 June 2009</ref><ref>[http://www.buckspct.nhs.uk/?page_id=158 Chesham Healthzone project \u2013 Bucks NHS PCT] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722154333/http://www.buckspct.nhs.uk/?page_id=158 |date=22 July 2011 }} Retrieved, 19 May 2009</ref><ref>[http://chesham.buckinghamshireadvertiser.co.uk/2011/12/cheshams-healthzone-to-open-it.html Chesham's Healthzone to open its doors this month Bucks Examiner 02-12-2011] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405143124/http://chesham.buckinghamshireadvertiser.co.uk/2011/12/cheshams-healthzone-to-open-it.html |date=5 April 2012 }} Retrieved, 6 December 2011</ref>\n\n===Emergency services===\n[[Thames Valley Police]] headquartered in [[Kidlington]], Oxfordshire is accountable for delivery of policing through the town's three [[Neighbourhood Policing Team]]s. [[Buckinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service]] based in Aylesbury oversees the town's fire and rescue services. There is a [[fire station]] located in Bellingdon Road which is supplemented by services from the station at Amersham and other nearby towns. Ambulance services are managed by [[South Central Ambulance Service|South Central Ambulance Service NHS Trust]] based in [[Bicester]], [[Oxford]]. The nearest [[ambulance station]] for the town is located in Amersham.\n\n==Religion==\n[[File:Chesham, The Salvation Army Hall, Broad Street - geograph.org.uk - 131890.jpg|thumb|Salvation Army Citadel]]\nThe oldest church building in Chesham is [[St. Mary's Church, Chesham|St. Mary's Church]] which dates from at least the 12th century. Chesham has a long history of religious [[dissent]], such as the persecuted [[Lollardy|Lollards]], followers of the [[John Wycliffe]] tradition.  One of them [[Thomas Harding]] was martyred on White Hill, near Dungrove Farm, in 1532. There is a memorial to local Lollards in [[Amersham]], and memorials to Thomas Harding in the churchyard and on White Hill.  The 17th, 18th and 19th centuries saw the rapid growth of [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|non-conformism]] especially [[Baptists]].  During the civil war there were groups of Quakers, Baptists and Presbyterians.  Broadway Baptist Church dates back to at least 1706 and had its 300th anniversary celebrations in Chesham in 2006.  Its roots are in the Chesham and Berkhamsted Baptist Church which dates back to 1640.\n[[File:Chesham Mosque.jpg|thumb|Chesham Mosque]]\nIn the present day, Chesham has four Baptist churches (Broadway Baptist, Trinity Baptist and Newtown Baptist) and four [[Anglican]] churches (St Mary's, Christ Church in Waterside, Hope Church, formerly called Hiving's Free Church, in Upper Belmont Road and Emmanuel in Newtown). There is a [[United Reformed Church]], formerly called the Congregational Church, in The Broadway, there was a [[Gospel Hall]] in Station Road (which closed at the end of 2008), a [[Roman Catholic]] church (St Columba's) in Berkhampstead Road (built in 1960), a [[Methodist]] chapel in Bellingdon Road, a [[Salvation Army]] Citadel in Broad St (closed in 2015), an historic [[Quaker]] [[Friends Meeting House]] in Bellingdon Road, The King's Church charismatic fellowship which meets at Chesham Park Community College.  Almost all of the Christian churches of Chesham work collectively as part of the Churches Together for Chesham (CTfC) group, which has 16 churches in membership.  Other religious groups include Chesham [[Spiritualist Church]] in Higham Road and the Jehovah's Witnesses off Bellingdon Road.\n\nDuring the Second World War, the first recorded Jewish congregation was founded on families evacuated from London who used to meet at the cricket pavilion.  After the war they combined with the Jewish community in Amersham which met at the synagogue in Amersham-on-the-Hill until 1968.

The [[stage coach]] bypassed the town and, unlike Amersham, there were no turnpikes and consequently roads were poorly maintained. Significant change occurred in the post Second World War period with the opening of the [[M1 motorway]]. The [[A416 road (Great Britain)|A416]] now runs through the town, from Amersham to [[Berkhamsted]], and connects the town to the more recently upgraded [[A41 road|A41]]. The A416 was diverted around the High Street and later upgraded to be dual-lane. Although these improvements enable more through traffic, traffic congestion has increased. Chesham's High Street was [[pedestrianisation|pedestrianised]] in 1990 and the benefits to the High Street have been felt ever since. Whilst some of the previous bustle has been lost, the impact of pedestrianisation has generally been positive.\n\n===Rail===\n[[File:Chesham Tube Station.jpg|thumb|Chesham tube station]]\n[[Chesham tube station]], close to the town centre, is the [[Terminal station|terminus]] for the [[Chesham branch]], a single track spur off the London Underground Metropolitan line connecting to [[Chalfont and Latimer station]]. The station was opened on 8 July 1889 by the [[Metropolitan Railway]] (MR). The line had been intended to extend to [[Tring railway station]] with connections to the [[London and North Western Railway]]{{'}}s [[West Coast Main Line]]. However, before work was begun, the MR chose an alternative route across the Chilterns. The idea was abandoned and the Metropolitan line reached Amersham and [[Aylesbury]]. There were some sizeable goods yards beyond the station, which were closed and now function as [[Waitrose]]'s car park except for one portion occupied by a coal merchants.\n\nIn 1959 electrification of the Metropolitan line to Chesham provided a more reliable connection to London. Following the cessation of London Underground services to Aylesbury in 1961 and the closure of [[Ongar tube station|Ongar]] in 1994, Chesham has become the furthest location served from central London, in terms of both distance and travelling time. Prior to December 2010, apart from a few direct trains to London at peak times, a shuttle service operated to and from Chalfont and Latimer station. Since then the town has benefited from direct trains to London all day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chilternvoice.co.uk/2010/12/01/last-chesham-shuttle-before-the-through-trains/|title=Last Chesham Shuttle Before the Through Trains|work=Chiltern Voice|accessdate=9 December 2010|location=Chesham|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722181721/http://www.chilternvoice.co.uk/2010/12/01/last-chesham-shuttle-before-the-through-trains/|archivedate=22 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe nearest [[National Rail]] connections are [[Amersham station]], although the LU line also connects directly to [[Chalfont & Latimer station]], from where the Metropolitan line and National Rail [[Chiltern Railways]] provide a joint service with Metropolitan line trains travelling to [[Baker Street]] station and Chiltern Railways trains travelling to [[Marylebone station]]. There is also access to London via [[Berkhamsted railway station]] on the [[West Coast Main Line]].\n\n===Bus services===\nBus companies running local services include [[Arriva Shires & Essex|Arriva]], [[Carousel Buses]], Red Rose, Redline and Red Eagle.\n\nResidential areas of the town are connected with the central shopping-area. Chesham is also connected by services to nearby Amersham, and further afield to [[High Wycombe]], [[Hemel Hempstead]], and Uxbridge.<ref>\nThe main service in Chesham is the route 1/1A operated by Arriva and Carousel. It connects the Pond Park estate to Chesham Town Centre and on to Amersham, Holmer Green, Hazlemere, and High Wycombe, serving the Eden Bus Station.\nCarousel Buses also operate the \"Chiltern Hundreds\" service 105 travelling through Chesham on its way from Hemel Hempstead, Bovingdon and Lye Green, on to Amersham, the Chalfonts, Gerrards Cross, Denham and Uxbridge.\n[http://www.buckscc.gov.uk/bcc/transport/Changes_to_bus_services_in_Chesham_and_Amersham.page?

(formerly '''Angel Studios, Inc.''') is an American [[video game developer]] and a studio of [[Rockstar Games]] based in [[Carlsbad, California]]. Founded by [[Colombians|Colombian]] artist and businessman Diego Angel in 1984, the company initially focused on animations and [[visual effects]] for multimedia productions, including films and [[music video]]s. Following Angel's business strategy of avoiding high-risk business sectors, the company began working in the [[video game industry]] during the 1990s. Its first video game projects were [[Ed Annunziata]]'s ''[[Ecco: The Tides of Time]]'' (1994) and ''[[Mr. Bones (video game)|Mr. Bones]]'' (1996), for which Angel Studios created [[cutscene]]s.\n\nThe company developed its own games in association with [[Nintendo]] (''[[Major League Baseball Featuring Ken Griffey Jr.]]'' and ''[[Ken Griffey Jr.'s Slugfest]]'') and [[Microsoft]] (''[[Midtown Madness]]'' and ''[[Midtown Madness 2]]''), and produced a [[Porting|port]] of [[Capcom]]'s ''[[Resident Evil 2]]'' for the [[Nintendo 64]]. Impressed with the studio's work on ''Midtown Madness'', Rockstar Games approached Angel Studios with a long-term partnership in 1999, which resulted in the creation of video game series ''[[Midnight Club]]'' and ''[[Smuggler's Run]]''.\n\nIn November 2002, Angel Studios was acquired by [[Take-Two Interactive]] (Rockstar Games' parent company) and became part of Rockstar Games as Rockstar San Diego. Since 2004, Rockstar San Diego has housed an internal [[game engine]] team that develops the [[Rockstar Advanced Game Engine]] (RAGE), Rockstar Games' proprietary engine used in most titles developed by its studios for [[personal computer]]s and [[Video game console|consoles]]. Rockstar San Diego led development of the 2010 game ''[[Red Dead Redemption]]'' and its [[expansion pack]] ''[[Undead Nightmare]]'', and collaborated with other Rockstar Games studios on ''[[Max Payne 3]]'' (2012), ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'' (2013), and ''[[Red Dead Redemption 2]]'' (2018).\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Beginnings, partnerships, and ''Resident Evil 2'' port (1984\u20132000) ===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Diego Angel.jpg|thumb|left|Diego Angel founded Angel Studios in 1984 and served as its [[President (corporate title)|president]] until 2005.<ref name=\"San Diego U-T: Before the bubble\" /><ref name=\"Polygon: How\" />]] -->\nColombian artist and businessman Diego Angel founded Angel Studios in 1984 in [[Carlsbad, California]], as a [[work-for-hire]] studio that created [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]].<ref name=\"San Diego U-T: Before the bubble\" /><ref name=\"Polygon: How\" /> Founding partners included Brad Hunt, Michael Limber, and Angel's [[brother-in-law]], of whom Limber became the company's [[chief creative officer]].<ref name=\"Playing at the Next Level\" /><ref name=\"VentureBeat: CCO\" /> Angel employed a philosophy he called the \"three P's\" (passion, patience, and perseverance), which meant that he would not accept any offer simply because it came his way;

this led him to approach the video game business.<ref name=\"San Diego U-T: Before the bubble\" /> Limber cited Angel's business model as the biggest factor in the company's survival of the [[dot-com bubble]], which severely impacted the [[San Diego County, California|San Diego-area]] multimedia industry.<ref name=\"San Diego U-T: Before the bubble\" /> Around this time, Angel Studios accepted game designer [[Ed Annunziata]]'s pitch to create [[cutscene]]s for the [[Sega CD]] version of ''[[Ecco: The Tides of Time]]''.<ref name=\"Playing at the Next Level\" /> Annunziata was pleased with the result and invited Angel Studios to work on cutscenes for his next game, ''[[Mr. Bones (video game)|Mr. Bones]]'', for the [[Sega Saturn]].<ref name=\"Playing at the Next Level\" /> ''Mr. Bones'' was released in 1996, with Angel Studios contributing the cutscenes and additional artwork.<ref name=\"Polygon: How\" /><ref name=\"Igromania: World Fame\" />\n\n{{Quote box |text=I was the only company in video games, the only [American] studio in those days, that was working and getting along with the Japanese.

some developed a sense of ownership of their respective parts.<ref name=\"Gamasutra: Scrum\" /> The game became ''[[Midtown Madness]]'', the May 1999 installment of [[Microsoft]]'s ''Madness'' line of racing titles.<ref name=\"GameSpot: Goes Gold\" /> Fred Marcus, a [[Video game designer|designer]] and [[Video game programmer|programmer]] on ''Midtown Madness'', stated that the studio's impressive [[Technology demonstration|physics demos]] were key to Angel Studios' publisher contracts.<ref name=\"Gamasutra: Physics\" /> The game spawned a three-title series, the second entry of which (''[[Midtown Madness 2]]'') was developed by Angel Studios and released in 2000.<ref name=\"Eurogamer: Midtown Madness\" /> Both titles' most-acclaimed elements were the detailed [[open-world]] environment, outstanding visual presentation and well-programmed [[artificial intelligence]].<ref name=\"GameSpot: Midtown Madness\" /><ref name=\"Gamasutra: AI Madness\" /> Angel Studios continued working with Microsoft on a game involving a [[Artificial human companion|virtual girlfriend]].<ref name=\"VentureBeat: CCO\" /><ref name=\"Siliconera: Interactive Xbox Girlfriend\" /> Known as ''XGirl'', the game was planned as a [[launch title]] for Microsoft's [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] console but was canceled.<ref name=\"VentureBeat: CCO\" /><ref name=\"Siliconera: Interactive Xbox Girlfriend\" /> A game based on ''[[La Femme Nikita (TV series)|La Femme Nikita]]'' was also pitched but never realized.<ref name=\"Siliconera: Interactive Xbox Girlfriend\" /> ''Sky Pirates VR'', a pirate-themed attraction based on [[Steven Spielberg]]'s \"vertical reality\" system, was exhibited in [[GameWorks]] theme parks, starting with their [[Detroit]] location in 2000 and later expanding to other locations that used this system, including that in [[Schaumburg, Illinois]].<ref name=\"XVG: Sky Pirates VR\" /><ref name=\"Chicago Tribune: Sky Pirates VR\" />\n\n=== Rockstar Games deals and acquisition (2000\u20132006) ===\n[[File:Angel Studios Logo.png|thumb|right|alt=A halo and the words \"Angel\" and \"Studios\", the latter entirely in upper-case letters, aligned vertically and enclosed within a blue oval that has a black outline and a horizontally striped overlay|Angel Studios' logo from 2000 to 2002, designed by Michael Limber<ref name=\"Michael Limber: Brand-Web-Print\" />]]\nAmerican [[video game publisher]] [[Rockstar Games]] became interested in the studio after the release of ''Midtown Madness'', wanting to use their combined expertise to develop what became the ''[[Midnight Club]]'' and ''Smuggler's Run'' series.<ref name=\"IGN: Red Dead\" /> Angel Studios worked on a sequel to [[Bungie West]]'s 2001 game, ''[[Oni (video game)|Oni]]'', which was owned by Rockstar Games [[parent company]], [[Take-Two Interactive]].<ref name=\"Eurogamer: Oni 2\" /> Titled ''Oni 2: Death & Taxes'', the game's production was later halted.<ref name=\"Kotaku: Cult Classic\" /> In a November 2000 interview, Rockstar Games' [[Sam Houser]] said: \"I love Angel Studios (...) I am not going to stop working with them.\"<ref name=\"IGN: Rockstar Envisions\" /> ''[[Daily Radar]]'' ranked Angel Studios fourth on a 2001 list of the five best developers for [[Sony]] platforms, citing the strength of ''[[Midnight Club: Street Racing]]'' and ''[[Smuggler's Run]]'' on the [[PlayStation 2]].<ref name=\"Daily Radar: Award\" />\n\nAround 2002, Angel discussed selling his company with Microsoft, [[Activision]] and Rockstar Games.<ref name=\"Polygon: How\" /> He had befriended Houser and his brother [[Dan Houser|Dan]], two of the founders of Rockstar Games, over a shared love of tequila.<ref name=\"Polygon: How\" /> Rockstar Games initially presented what Angel considered a [[low-ball]] offer, to which he did not respond.<ref name=\"Polygon: How\" /> The company then presented an offer that Angel said he could not refuse, and he felt that Rockstar Games was willing to give the studio the freedom he wanted it to have.<ref name=\"Polygon: How\" /> On the other hand, Rockstar Games sought to acquire Angel Studios' Angel Game Engine as a proprietary engine replacing [[Criterion Games]]' [[RenderWare]], which it had used for games in the ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'' series.<ref name=\"Polygon: How\" /> Take-Two Interactive announced the acquisition of Angel Studios on November 20, 2002;

Capcom's [[Yoshiki Okamoto]] then approached Angel Studios with the idea for an original [[intellectual property]] entitled ''S.W.A.T.''.<ref name=\"Polygon: How\" /> It later adopted a [[Western (genre)|Western]] theme at Okamoto's recommendation, redefining the acronym as \"Spaghetti Western Action Team\".<ref name=\"Polygon: How\" /> Angel Studios began work on the game with Capcom's oversight and funding in 2000, and the latter announced the game in March 2002.<ref name=\"IGN: Red Dead Interview\" /><ref name=\"IGN: Capcom Unveils\" /> Its development was troubled, partially due to cultural differences between the two companies, and the game remained unplayable.<ref name=\"Polygon: How\" /> ''Red Dead Revolver'' missed the 2002 [[European Computer Trade Show]] and 2003 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] (E3).<ref name=\"IGN: Capcom TGS\" /><ref name=\"GameSpot: status update\" /> Okamoto then left Capcom,<ref name=\"Polygon: How\" /> which stopped funding the game in July 2003 and announced in August of that year that the game was canceled.<ref name=\"GameSpot: Capcom no longer\" /><ref name=\"GameSpot: Capcom cancels\" /> Rockstar Games acquired the rights to ''Red Dead Revolver'' in December, and resumed its development.<ref name=\"GameSpot: Rockstar rescues\" /><ref name=\"IGN: Rockstar Announces\" /> The game's \"[[Video game developer#\"Crunch time\"|crunch time]]\" increased for as rapid a release as possible, and it was released in May 2004 for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox.<ref name=\"Polygon: How\" />\n\nRockstar San Diego began developing ''Agent'', an open-world [[stealth game]] for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox, in 2003.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /><ref name=\"VG247: Another E3\" /> The development team leadership was mostly as the same as that of Rockstar San Diego's 2001 game ''[[Transworld Surf]]'', headed up by [[Video game producer|producer]] Luis Gigliotti.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /> In favor of developing ''Agent'', the team ceased work on an untitled [[Justice League]] game that was still being conceptualized.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /> Unlike prior Angel Studios games, ''Agent'' began a prototype stage with a full-size team.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /> This team was given little time to complete this prototype, leading to much \"[[Video game developer#\"Crunch time\"|crunch]]\" at the studio.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /> Rockstar Games also removed studio-wide vacations after successfully reaching milestones or launching a game, a change many employees felt was abrupt.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /> Some Rockstar San Diego artists traveled to [[Cairo]] and [[Washington, D.C.]], two locations ''Agent'' was to be set in.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /> The four artists that traveled to Cairo took \"over 10,000\" of such photographs.<ref name=\"Kotaku: Talking To The PS4\" /> In both cases, artists were detained by the local police forces; it was resolved quickly in D.C. but took significantly longer for those situated in Cairo.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /> However, both teams could eventually return with the photographs they had taken and development was able to continue.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /> At the same time, Rockstar Games and the Houser brothers kept requesting changes so frequently that the studio was not able to keep up, leading to overwork and more crunch.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /> Around this time, three people connected to the studio (one active employee and two former employees) died.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /> This combined also made for a toxic studio culture.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /> After a year of work, Gigliotti left the studio and formed the studio Concrete Games in conjunction with publisher [[THQ]], followed by eleven of ''Agent''{{'s}} leads also leaving Rockstar San Diego to join Gigliotti's new studio on the next day.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /> To compensate for these departures, ''Red Dead Revolver'' developers were put in charge for ''Agent'' after ''Red Dead Revolver'' was released.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /> Under the new leadership, the studio spent another year upgrading its internal [[game engine]] for use within ''Agent''.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /> Shortly thereafter, the game was put on hold indefinitely.<ref name=\"VG247: Agent listed\" />\n\nAfter Criterion Games was acquired by [[Electronic Arts]] in 2004, Rockstar San Diego established [[RAGE Technology Group]]: an in-studio team to develop the [[Rockstar Advanced Game Engine]] (RAGE), its proprietary game engine.<ref name=\"GameStar: RAGE\" /> The engine was introduced in ''[[Rockstar Games Presents Table Tennis]]'', also developed by Rockstar San Diego and released for [[Xbox 360]] and [[Wii]] in 2006.<ref name=\"Kotaku: That Time\" /> RAGE remains under development and is used in most of Rockstar Games' personal computer and [[Video game console|console]] titles, including ''[[Red Dead Redemption]]'', ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'', ''[[Max Payne 3]]'', ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'' and ''[[Red Dead Redemption 2]]''.<ref name=\"Digital Spy: Table Tennis\" /><ref name=\"Eurogamer: RAGE\" /> Diego Angel left Rockstar San Diego in 2005 to return to his hometown in Colombia.<ref name=\"Polygon: How\" /> Alan Wasserman, who had joined Rockstar San Diego in 2003, replaced Angel and became the studio's [[general manager]].<ref name=\"Gamasutra: Angel in Disguise\" /> By January 2006, the studio began searching for new talent to produce next-generation games.<ref name=\"IGN: Prepares for Next-Gen\" />\n\n=== Controversy, ''Red Dead Redemption'', and layoffs (2006\u20132011) ===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Red Dead Redemption.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Many critics claim ''Red Dead Redemption'' (cover pictured) to be, Rockstar San Diego's greatest work so far, and one of Rocksar Games' best releases ever.<ref name=\"San Diego U-T: Rockstar conquers\" />]] -->\nTerri-Kim Chuckry and Garrett Flynn, former Rockstar San Diego [[Video game artist|3D artists]], filed a [[class action]] lawsuit on behalf of themselves and over one hundred other ex-employees against the company on August 26, 2006, claiming unpaid overtime compensation.<ref name=\"Engadget: Lawsuit\" /> The case, ''Garrett Flynn, et al. v.

(formerly '''Angel Studios, Inc.''') is an American [[video game developer]] and a studio of [[Rockstar Games]] based in [[Carlsbad, California]]. Founded by [[Colombians|Colombian]] artist and businessman Diego Angel in 1984, the company initially focused on animations and [[visual effects]] for multimedia productions, including films and [[music video]]s. Following Angel's business strategy of avoiding high-risk business sectors, the company began working in the [[video game industry]] during the 1990s. Its first video game projects were [[Ed Annunziata]]'s ''[[Ecco: The Tides of Time]]'' (1994) and ''[[Mr. Bones (video game)|Mr. Bones]]'' (1996), for which Angel Studios created [[cutscene]]s.\n\nThe company developed its own games in association with [[Nintendo]] (''[[Major League Baseball Featuring Ken Griffey Jr.]]'' and ''[[Ken Griffey Jr.'s Slugfest]]'') and [[Microsoft]] (''[[Midtown Madness]]'' and ''[[Midtown Madness 2]]''), and produced a [[Porting|port]] of [[Capcom]]'s ''[[Resident Evil 2]]'' for the [[Nintendo 64]]. Impressed with the studio's work on ''Midtown Madness'', Rockstar Games approached Angel Studios with a long-term partnership in 1999, which resulted in the creation of video game series ''[[Midnight Club]]'' and ''[[Smuggler's Run]]''.\n\nIn November 2002, Angel Studios was acquired by [[Take-Two Interactive]] (Rockstar Games' parent company) and became part of Rockstar Games as Rockstar San Diego. Since 2004, Rockstar San Diego has housed an internal [[game engine]] team that develops the [[Rockstar Advanced Game Engine]] (RAGE), Rockstar Games' proprietary engine used in most titles developed by its studios for [[personal computer]]s and [[Video game console|consoles]]. Rockstar San Diego led development of the 2010 game ''[[Red Dead Redemption]]'' and its [[expansion pack]] ''[[Undead Nightmare]]'', and collaborated with other Rockstar Games studios on ''[[Max Payne 3]]'' (2012), ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'' (2013), and ''[[Red Dead Redemption 2]]'' (2018).\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Beginnings, partnerships, and ''Resident Evil 2'' port (1984\u20132000) ===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Diego Angel.jpg|thumb|left|Diego Angel founded Angel Studios in 1984 and served as its [[President (corporate title)|president]] until 2005.<ref name=\"San Diego U-T: Before the bubble\" /><ref name=\"Polygon: How\" />]] -->\nColombian artist and businessman Diego Angel founded Angel Studios in 1984 in [[Carlsbad, California]], as a [[work-for-hire]] studio that created [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]].<ref name=\"San Diego U-T: Before the bubble\" /><ref name=\"Polygon: How\" /> Founding partners included Brad Hunt, Michael Limber, and Angel's [[brother-in-law]], of whom Limber became the company's [[chief creative officer]].<ref name=\"Playing at the Next Level\" /><ref name=\"VentureBeat: CCO\" /> Angel employed a philosophy he called the \"three P's\" (passion, patience, and perseverance), which meant that he would not accept any offer simply because it came his way; instead, he opted for projects that showcased his team and their technology.<ref name=\"Polygon: How\" /> According to Angel Studios employees, Angel treated them like family, paying them well, giving them plenty of vacation time, and sharing a bottle of [[Patr\u00f3n]] [[tequila]] with them at the \"Sippy Wippy\" he occasionally held on Friday afternoons.<ref name=\"Polygon: How\" /><ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /> Much of the 3D work produced by Angel Studios were films and [[music video]]s.<ref name=\"Polygon: How\" /><ref name=\"Igromania: World Fame\" /> It was most successful with the [[computer-generated imagery]] and [[visual effects]] in the film ''[[The Lawnmower Man (film)|The Lawnmower Man]]'' and the music video for [[Peter Gabriel]]'s \"Kiss That Frog\", both released in 1992.<ref name=\"Polygon: How\" /><ref name=\"Destructoid: Pixel\" /><ref name=\"Game Informer: Unlikely Movie Games\" /> The video for \"Kiss That Frog\" received the Best Special Effects in a Video award at the [[1994 MTV Video Music Awards]].<ref name=\"Polygon: How\" /><ref name=\"The Free Library: Dream Team\" /> For ''The Lawnmower Man'', Angel Studios produced two major scenes;

this led him to approach the video game business.<ref name=\"San Diego U-T: Before the bubble\" /> Limber cited Angel's business model as the biggest factor in the company's survival of the [[dot-com bubble]], which severely impacted the [[San Diego County, California|San Diego-area]] multimedia industry.<ref name=\"San Diego U-T: Before the bubble\" /> Around this time, Angel Studios accepted game designer [[Ed Annunziata]]'s pitch to create [[cutscene]]s for the [[Sega CD]] version of ''[[Ecco: The Tides of Time]]''.<ref name=\"Playing at the Next Level\" /> Annunziata was pleased with the result and invited Angel Studios to work on cutscenes for his next game, ''[[Mr. Bones (video game)|Mr. Bones]]'', for the [[Sega Saturn]].<ref name=\"Playing at the Next Level\" /> ''Mr. Bones'' was released in 1996, with Angel Studios contributing the cutscenes and additional artwork.<ref name=\"Polygon: How\" /><ref name=\"Igromania: World Fame\" />\n\n{{Quote box |text=I was the only company in video games, the only [American] studio in those days, that was working and getting along with the Japanese.

Capcom's [[Yoshiki Okamoto]] then approached Angel Studios with the idea for an original [[intellectual property]] entitled ''S.W.A.T.''.<ref name=\"Polygon: How\" /> It later adopted a [[Western (genre)|Western]] theme at Okamoto's recommendation, redefining the acronym as \"Spaghetti Western Action Team\".<ref name=\"Polygon: How\" /> Angel Studios began work on the game with Capcom's oversight and funding in 2000, and the latter announced the game in March 2002.<ref name=\"IGN: Red Dead Interview\" /><ref name=\"IGN: Capcom Unveils\" /> Its development was troubled, partially due to cultural differences between the two companies, and the game remained unplayable.<ref name=\"Polygon: How\" /> ''Red Dead Revolver'' missed the 2002 [[European Computer Trade Show]] and 2003 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] (E3).<ref name=\"IGN: Capcom TGS\" /><ref name=\"GameSpot: status update\" /> Okamoto then left Capcom,<ref name=\"Polygon: How\" /> which stopped funding the game in July 2003 and announced in August of that year that the game was canceled.<ref name=\"GameSpot: Capcom no longer\" /><ref name=\"GameSpot: Capcom cancels\" /> Rockstar Games acquired the rights to ''Red Dead Revolver'' in December, and resumed its development.<ref name=\"GameSpot: Rockstar rescues\" /><ref name=\"IGN: Rockstar Announces\" /> The game's \"[[Video game developer#\"Crunch time\"|crunch time]]\" increased for as rapid a release as possible, and it was released in May 2004 for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox.<ref name=\"Polygon: How\" />\n\nRockstar San Diego began developing ''Agent'', an open-world [[stealth game]] for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox, in 2003.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /><ref name=\"VG247: Another E3\" /> The development team leadership was mostly as the same as that of Rockstar San Diego's 2001 game ''[[Transworld Surf]]'', headed up by [[Video game producer|producer]] Luis Gigliotti.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /> In favor of developing ''Agent'', the team ceased work on an untitled [[Justice League]] game that was still being conceptualized.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /> Unlike prior Angel Studios games, ''Agent'' began a prototype stage with a full-size team.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /> This team was given little time to complete this prototype, leading to much \"[[Video game developer#\"Crunch time\"|crunch]]\" at the studio.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /> Rockstar Games also removed studio-wide vacations after successfully reaching milestones or launching a game, a change many employees felt was abrupt.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /> Some Rockstar San Diego artists traveled to [[Cairo]] and [[Washington, D.C.]], two locations ''Agent'' was to be set in.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /> The four artists that traveled to Cairo took \"over 10,000\" of such photographs.<ref name=\"Kotaku: Talking To The PS4\" /> In both cases, artists were detained by the local police forces; it was resolved quickly in D.C. but took significantly longer for those situated in Cairo.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /> However, both teams could eventually return with the photographs they had taken and development was able to continue.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /> At the same time, Rockstar Games and the Houser brothers kept requesting changes so frequently that the studio was not able to keep up, leading to overwork and more crunch.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /> Around this time, three people connected to the studio (one active employee and two former employees) died.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /> This combined also made for a toxic studio culture.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /> After a year of work, Gigliotti left the studio and formed the studio Concrete Games in conjunction with publisher [[THQ]], followed by eleven of ''Agent''{{'s}} leads also leaving Rockstar San Diego to join Gigliotti's new studio on the next day.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /> To compensate for these departures, ''Red Dead Revolver'' developers were put in charge for ''Agent'' after ''Red Dead Revolver'' was released.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /> Under the new leadership, the studio spent another year upgrading its internal [[game engine]] for use within ''Agent''.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /> Shortly thereafter, the game was put on hold indefinitely.<ref name=\"VG247: Agent listed\" />\n\nAfter Criterion Games was acquired by [[Electronic Arts]] in 2004, Rockstar San Diego established [[RAGE Technology Group]]: an in-studio team to develop the [[Rockstar Advanced Game Engine]] (RAGE), its proprietary game engine.<ref name=\"GameStar: RAGE\" /> The engine was introduced in ''[[Rockstar Games Presents Table Tennis]]'', also developed by Rockstar San Diego and released for [[Xbox 360]] and [[Wii]] in 2006.<ref name=\"Kotaku: That Time\" /> RAGE remains under development and is used in most of Rockstar Games' personal computer and [[Video game console|console]] titles, including ''[[Red Dead Redemption]]'', ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'', ''[[Max Payne 3]]'', ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'' and ''[[Red Dead Redemption 2]]''.<ref name=\"Digital Spy: Table Tennis\" /><ref name=\"Eurogamer: RAGE\" /> Diego Angel left Rockstar San Diego in 2005 to return to his hometown in Colombia.<ref name=\"Polygon: How\" /> Alan Wasserman, who had joined Rockstar San Diego in 2003, replaced Angel and became the studio's [[general manager]].<ref name=\"Gamasutra: Angel in Disguise\" /> By January 2006, the studio began searching for new talent to produce next-generation games.<ref name=\"IGN: Prepares for Next-Gen\" />\n\n=== Controversy, ''Red Dead Redemption'', and layoffs (2006\u20132011) ===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Red Dead Redemption.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Many critics claim ''Red Dead Redemption'' (cover pictured) to be, Rockstar San Diego's greatest work so far, and one of Rocksar Games' best releases ever.<ref name=\"San Diego U-T: Rockstar conquers\" />]] -->\nTerri-Kim Chuckry and Garrett Flynn, former Rockstar San Diego [[Video game artist|3D artists]], filed a [[class action]] lawsuit on behalf of themselves and over one hundred other ex-employees against the company on August 26, 2006, claiming unpaid overtime compensation.<ref name=\"Engadget: Lawsuit\" /> The case, ''Garrett Flynn, et al. v.

Her second marriage to [[King Edward IV]] made her Queen of England, thus elevating Grey's status at court and in the realm as the stepson of the King.{{sfn|Pugh|2004}} Through his mother's assiduous endeavours, he made two materially advantageous marriages to wealthy heiresses, the King's niece Anne Holland and [[Cecily Bonville, 7th Baroness Harington]]. By the latter he had 14 children.\n\n==Family==\nThomas Grey was born in 1455 close to the [[Palace of Westminster]], near the [[City of London]]. He was the elder son of [[John Grey of Groby|Sir John Grey]] (c.1432-1461) of [[Groby]] in Leicestershire, by his wife [[Elizabeth Woodville]], who later became queen consort to King [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=431}}\n\n==Career==\nHis mother endeavoured to improve his estates by the conventional methods of their class and time, through his marriages and purchase of wardships. He also found favour with Edward, fighting in the [[Battle of Tewkesbury]] in 1471. Grey became Lord Harington and Bonville by right of his second wife [[Cecily Bonville, 7th Baroness Harington|Cecily Bonville]]. In 1475 he was created [[marquess of Dorset]], and he was also a [[Order of the Garter|knight of the Garter]] and a [[Privy Council of England|privy councillor]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=431}}\n\nOn the death of his stepfather, Edward IV, and his 12-year-old half-brother, [[Edward V of England|Edward V]]'s, accession to the throne on 9 April 1483, Grey proved unable to maintain his family's position. It was not possible to arrange a Woodville regency.  Internal fighting, particularly the long-established battle for ascendancy in [[Leicestershire]] between the Grey and Hastings families, now on the national stage, allowed [[Richard III of England|Richard, duke of Gloucester]] to seize power and usurp the throne; the Grey family was aligned with Edward.  On 25 June 1483, an assembly of Parliament declared Richard III to be the legitimate king, and Thomas's uncle and brother, [[Anthony Woodville, 2nd Earl Rivers]], and [[Richard Grey]], respectively, were executed. Later in the summer, learning of the apparent murder of [[Princes in the Tower|both his young half-brothers]], Grey joined the [[Duke of Buckingham's rebellion]] against Richard III. When the rebellion failed he fled to Brittany to join [[Henry VII of England|Henry Tudor]], the future Henry VII, who pledged to marry Grey's half-sister [[Elizabeth of York]] and heal the Yorkist/Lancastrian division.\n\nHowever, just before Henry and the Lancastrian army left to launch their ultimately successful invasion of England in August 1485, Grey heard rumours from England that his mother had come to terms with Richard III, and he was persuaded to desert Henry Tudor. He was intercepted at [[Compi\u00e8gne]] on his way to England, and played no part in the invasion or subsequent overthrow of Richard III. Grey was instead confined to Paris, as security for the repayment of a loan made to Henry Tudor by the French government, unable to return home until Henry VII was safely installed as king of England.\n\nThereafter Henry VII took good care to keep his Queen's half-brother under control and Grey was not permitted to recover his former influence, although his attainder was reversed.  Thomas Grey was confined in the Tower in 1487 during [[Lambert Simnel]]'s rising and not released until after the [[House of Tudor]] victory in the [[Battle of Stoke Field]]. Though he accompanied the King on his expedition to France in 1492, he was obliged to commit himself in writing to ensure he did not commit treason. He was permitted to assist in suppression of the [[Cornish Rebellion of 1497|Cornish rising]] in 1497.\n\nThomas Grey, Marquess of Dorset, died in London on 20 September 1501, aged about 46, and was buried in the collegiate church of [[Astley, Warwickshire]]. His wife survived him and married Grey's cousin, [[Henry Stafford, 1st Earl of Wiltshire|Henry Stafford]], later Earl of Wiltshire.\n\n==Marriages and issue==\nHis mother sought to make provision for him by marriage to wealthy heiresses. He married firstly, at Greenwich in October 1466, Lady Anne Holland (1461<ref>Oxford, Bodleian Library MS Digby 57, fol. 2*r</ref>{{snd}}c.&nbsp;1474), the only daughter of [[Henry Holland, 3rd Duke of Exeter]], and [[Anne of York, Duchess of Exeter|Anne of York]]. His mother-in-law was the second child and eldest surviving daughter of [[Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York]], and [[Cecily Neville]], thus sister to his mother's second husband King [[Edward IV]].\n\nAfter Anne Holland died young without issue, Thomas married secondly, by [[papal dispensation]] 5 September 1474,{{sfn|Richardson II|2011|p=304}} [[Cecily Bonville, 7th Baroness Harington|Cecily Bonville]], [[Baron Harington|7th Baroness Harington of Aldingham]] and 2nd Baroness Bonville, the wealthiest heiress in England.<ref>[http://www.britannia.com/lympstone/lympstone.html Lympstone: From Roman Rimes to the 17th Century.

Her second marriage to [[King Edward IV]] made her Queen of England, thus elevating Grey's status at court and in the realm as the stepson of the King.{{sfn|Pugh|2004}} Through his mother's assiduous endeavours, he made two materially advantageous marriages to wealthy heiresses, the King's niece Anne Holland and [[Cecily Bonville, 7th Baroness Harington]]. By the latter he had 14 children.\n\n==Family==\nThomas Grey was born in 1455 close to the [[Palace of Westminster]], near the [[City of London]]. He was the elder son of [[John Grey of Groby|Sir John Grey]] (c.1432-1461) of [[Groby]] in Leicestershire, by his wife [[Elizabeth Woodville]], who later became queen consort to King [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=431}}\n\n==Career==\nHis mother endeavoured to improve his estates by the conventional methods of their class and time, through his marriages and purchase of wardships. He also found favour with Edward, fighting in the [[Battle of Tewkesbury]] in 1471. Grey became Lord Harington and Bonville by right of his second wife [[Cecily Bonville, 7th Baroness Harington|Cecily Bonville]]. In 1475 he was created [[marquess of Dorset]], and he was also a [[Order of the Garter|knight of the Garter]] and a [[Privy Council of England|privy councillor]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=431}}\n\nOn the death of his stepfather, Edward IV, and his 12-year-old half-brother, [[Edward V of England|Edward V]]'s, accession to the throne on 9 April 1483, Grey proved unable to maintain his family's position. It was not possible to arrange a Woodville regency.  Internal fighting, particularly the long-established battle for ascendancy in [[Leicestershire]] between the Grey and Hastings families, now on the national stage, allowed [[Richard III of England|Richard, duke of Gloucester]] to seize power and usurp the throne; the Grey family was aligned with Edward.  On 25 June 1483, an assembly of Parliament declared Richard III to be the legitimate king, and Thomas's uncle and brother, [[Anthony Woodville, 2nd Earl Rivers]], and [[Richard Grey]], respectively, were executed. Later in the summer, learning of the apparent murder of [[Princes in the Tower|both his young half-brothers]], Grey joined the [[Duke of Buckingham's rebellion]] against Richard III. When the rebellion failed he fled to Brittany to join [[Henry VII of England|Henry Tudor]], the future Henry VII, who pledged to marry Grey's half-sister [[Elizabeth of York]] and heal the Yorkist/Lancastrian division.\n\nHowever, just before Henry and the Lancastrian army left to launch their ultimately successful invasion of England in August 1485, Grey heard rumours from England that his mother had come to terms with Richard III, and he was persuaded to desert Henry Tudor. He was intercepted at [[Compi\u00e8gne]] on his way to England, and played no part in the invasion or subsequent overthrow of Richard III. Grey was instead confined to Paris, as security for the repayment of a loan made to Henry Tudor by the French government, unable to return home until Henry VII was safely installed as king of England.\n\nThereafter Henry VII took good care to keep his Queen's half-brother under control and Grey was not permitted to recover his former influence, although his attainder was reversed.  Thomas Grey was confined in the Tower in 1487 during [[Lambert Simnel]]'s rising and not released until after the [[House of Tudor]] victory in the [[Battle of Stoke Field]]. Though he accompanied the King on his expedition to France in 1492, he was obliged to commit himself in writing to ensure he did not commit treason. He was permitted to assist in suppression of the [[Cornish Rebellion of 1497|Cornish rising]] in 1497.\n\nThomas Grey, Marquess of Dorset, died in London on 20 September 1501, aged about 46, and was buried in the collegiate church of [[Astley, Warwickshire]]. His wife survived him and married Grey's cousin, [[Henry Stafford, 1st Earl of Wiltshire|Henry Stafford]], later Earl of Wiltshire.\n\n==Marriages and issue==\nHis mother sought to make provision for him by marriage to wealthy heiresses. He married firstly, at Greenwich in October 1466, Lady Anne Holland (1461<ref>Oxford, Bodleian Library MS Digby 57, fol. 2*r</ref>{{snd}}c.&nbsp;1474), the only daughter of [[Henry Holland, 3rd Duke of Exeter]], and [[Anne of York, Duchess of Exeter|Anne of York]]. His mother-in-law was the second child and eldest surviving daughter of [[Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York]], and [[Cecily Neville]], thus sister to his mother's second husband King [[Edward IV]].\n\nAfter Anne Holland died young without issue, Thomas married secondly, by [[papal dispensation]] 5 September 1474,{{sfn|Richardson II|2011|p=304}} [[Cecily Bonville, 7th Baroness Harington|Cecily Bonville]], [[Baron Harington|7th Baroness Harington of Aldingham]] and 2nd Baroness Bonville, the wealthiest heiress in England.<ref>[http://www.britannia.com/lympstone/lympstone.html Lympstone: From Roman Rimes to the 17th Century.

Additionally, the owners of the individual units also collectively own the common areas of the property, such as corridors\\hallways, walkways, laundry rooms, etc., as well as common utilities and amenities, such as the [[HVAC]] system, elevators, and so on. Many shopping malls are industrial condominiums in which the individual retail and office spaces are owned by the businesses that occupy them while the common areas of the mall are collectively owned by all the business entities that own the individual spaces.\n\nThe common areas, amenities, and utilities are managed collectively by the owners through their association, such as a [[homeowner association]].\n\nScholars have traced the earliest known use of the condominium form of tenure to a document from first-century [[Babylon]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/02/nyregion/fighting-dog-owners-discourtesy-with-dna-in-brooklyn.html?smid=tw-nytmetro|title=Using DNA to Fight Dog Owners\u2019 Discourtesy in Brooklyn|publisher=}}</ref> The word ''[[Wiktionary:condominium#Latin|condominium]]'' originated in [[Latin]].\n\n[[Italy]] uses ''[[Wiktionary:condominio#Italian|condominio]]'', which is simply the modern Italian form of ''condominium''.

In Spain, the legal term is ''comunidad de propietarios''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.comunidades.com|title=Comunidades de propietarios y no comunidades de vecinos|website=Comunidades}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.madrid.org/cs/Satellite?c=FRAME_Contenido_FA&childpagename=PortalConsumidor%2FFRAME_Contenido_FA%2FPTCS_contenidoReportajes&cid=1354340294830&p=1343064181510&pagename=PTCS_wrapper |title=Comunidades de propietarios: lo que hay que saber - Madrid.org - Portal del Consumidor |publisher=Madrid.org |date= |accessdate=2018-07-19}}</ref> and the popular term is ''comunidad de vecinos''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.madrid.org/cs/Satellite?cid=1207574902747&language=es&pagename=PortalVivienda%2FPage%2FPVIV_listado |title=Vivienda &#124; Comunidad de Madrid |language=es |publisher=Madrid.org |date=2018-06-27 |accessdate=2018-07-19}}</ref> \n\n{{toclimit|2}}\n\n== Etymology ==\n{{Property law}}\n''Condominium'' is an invented [[Latin]] word formed by adding the prefix ''con-'' \u2018together\u2019 to the word ''dominium'' \u2018dominion, ownership\u2019. Its meaning is therefore \u2018joint dominion\u2019 or \u2018co-ownership\u2019.\n\n''Condominia'' (the Latin plural of ''condominium'') originally referred to territories over which two or more sovereign powers shared joint sovereignty. This technique was frequently used to settle border disputes when multiple claimants could not agree on how to partition the disputed territory. For example, from 1818 to 1846, [[Oregon Country]] was a condominium over which both the [[United States of America|United States]] and [[Great Britain]] shared joint sovereignty until the [[Oregon Treaty]] resolved the issue by splitting the territory along the 49th parallel and each country gaining sole sovereignty of one side.\n\n== Overview ==\nThe difference between an \"apartment\" complex and condominium is purely legal. There is no way to differentiate a condominium from an apartment simply by looking at or visiting the building. What defines a condominium is the form of ownership. A building developed as a condominium (and ''sold'' in individual units to different ''owners'') could actually be built at another location as an apartment building (the developers would retain ownership and ''rent'' individual units to different ''tenants'').  As a practical matter, builders tend to build condominiums to higher quality standards than apartment complexes because of the differences between the rental and sale markets.\n\nTechnically, a condominium is a collection of individual home units and [[common area]]s along with the land upon which they sit. Individual home ownership within a condominium is construed as ownership of only the air space confining the boundaries of the home. The boundaries of that space are specified by a legal document known as a Declaration, filed on record with the local governing authority. Typically, these boundaries will include the wall surrounding a condo, allowing the homeowner to make some interior modifications without impacting the common area. Anything outside this boundary is held in an undivided ownership interest by a corporation established at the time of the condominium's creation. The corporation holds this property in trust on behalf of the homeowners as a group\u2014it may not have ownership itself.\n\nCondominiums have conditions, covenants, and restrictions, and often additional rules that govern how the individual unit owners are to share the space.\n\nIt is also possible for a condominium to consist of single-family dwellings. There are also \"detached condominiums\" where homeowners do not maintain the exteriors of the dwellings, yards, etc. and \"site condominiums\" where the owner has more control and possibly ownership (as in a \"whole lot\" or \"lot line\" condominium) over the exterior appearance. These structures are preferred by some [[planned neighborhood]]s and [[gated community|gated communities]].\n\n== Homeowners association ==\n\nA [[homeowners association]] (HOA), whose members are the unit owners, manages the condominium through a board of directors elected by the membership. This exists under various names depending on the jurisdiction, such as \"unit title\", \"sectional title\", \"[[commonhold]]\", \"strata council\", or \"[[tenant-owner's association]]\", \"body corporate\", \"Owners Corporation\", \"condominium corporation\" or \"condominium association\". Another variation of this concept is the \"time share\", although not all time shares are condominiums, and not all time shares involve actual ownership of (i.e., deeded title to) real property. Condominiums may be found in both [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] and [[common law]] legal systems as it is purely a creation of [[statute]].  Among other things, the HOA assesses unit owners for the costs of maintaining the common areas, etc.  That is, the HOA decides how much each owner should pay and has the legal power to collect that.\n\n== Unit description ==\n[[File:The Cosmopolitan Singapore.jpg|thumb|The Cosmopolitan, a condominium in [[Singapore]]]]\n\nThe description of the condominium units and the common areas and any restrictions on their use is established in a document commonly called a \"Master Deed\" (also known as the \"Enabling Declaration\", the \"Declaration of Conditions\", or the \"Condominium Document\").  Among other things, this document provides for the creation of the HOA. Rules of governance for the association are usually covered under a separate set of bylaws which generally govern the internal affairs of the condominium. Condominium bylaws usually establish the responsibilities of the owners' association; the voting procedures to be used at [[Deliberative assembly|association meetings]]; the qualifications, powers, and duties of the board of directors; the powers and duties of the officers; and the obligations of the owners with regard to assessments, maintenance, and use of the units and common areas. Finally, a set of rules and regulations providing specific details of restrictions on conduct of unit owners and residents are established by the HOA.<ref name=\"KamanCusimano\">{{cite web|title=Understanding the Government of a Community Association|url=http://www.ohiocondolaw.com/articles/governance_community_assn.htm|publisher=Kaman & Cusimano|accessdate=24 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115041050/http://www.ohiocondolaw.com/articles/governance_community_assn.htm|archive-date=2012-01-15|url-status=dead}}</ref> These are more readily amendable than the declaration or association bylaws, typically requiring only a vote of the HOA board.  Typical rules include mandatory maintenance fees (perhaps collected monthly), pet restrictions, and color/design choices visible from the exterior of the units. Generally, these sets of rules and regulations are made available to residents and or as a matter of public record via a condominium or homeowners association website or through public files, depending on the state and its applicable laws. Condominiums are usually owned in [[fee simple]] [[title]], but can be owned in ways that other [[real estate]] can be owned, such as title held in [[Trust law|trust]]. In some jurisdictions, such as [[Ontario]], Canada or [[Hawaii]] USA, there are \"leasehold condominiums\" where the development is built on leased land.\n\nIn general, condominium unit owners can [[Renting|rent]] their home to [[leasehold estate|tenant]]s, similar to renting out other real estate, although leasing rights may be subject to conditions or restrictions set forth in the declaration (such as a rental cap for the total number of units in a community that can be leased at one time) or otherwise as permitted by local law.\n\n== Non-residential uses ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2016}}\nCondominium ownership is also used, albeit less frequently, for non-residential land uses: offices, hotel rooms, retail shops, private airports, marinas, group housing facilities (retirement homes or dormitories),  bare land (in [[Condominiums in Canada|British Columbia]])) and [[storage condo|storage]]. The legal structure is the same, and many of the benefits are similar; for instance, a nonprofit corporation may face a lower tax liability in an office condominium than in an office rented from a taxable, for-profit company. However, the frequent turnover of commercial land uses in particular can make the inflexibility of condominium arrangements problematic.\n\n== Similar concepts ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}\nThere are many forms of real estate ownership that are similar to condominiums but not identical.\n\nClassic privately owned detached houses on privately owned lots may be part of a community that has a homeowner's association.  Such an association may administer a common park area, for example, or an access road, or architectural standards for the houses.\n\nIn a townhouse complex, multiple physical houses are combined into a single architectural building.  Each unit owner owns an identified plot of land and the building affixed to it, but that building is physically part of a larger building that spans lots.  There is a continuous roof and foundation and a single wall divides adjacent townhouses. If there is an apartment below not owned by owner of townhouse, then it is not a townhouse, just a bi-level apartment/condominium. Legally, this is very similar to detached houses, but because of the intertwining of interests in the single architectural building, a homeowner's association is required.  It would be impractical, for example to replace the roof of just one townhouse.  But unlike the condominium, the townhouse complex's HOA owns none of the building or the land under it.  It is essentially under contract to the townhouse owners to maintain the parts of the building that are hard to divide.  Even the walls between townhouses are usually outside the purview of the HOA, being jointly owned and maintained by the owners of the townhouses on either side.  Like the condominium, the townhouse complex often has common areas for roads, parking, clubhouses, and such.\n\nA rowhouse is like a townhouse except that the houses are not physically connected.  They are independent structures that simply have no space between them.  Technically, they are detached.\n\nA building with multiple residential units may simply be owned in common by multiple people, with each having specific rights to a particular unit and undivided interest in the rest.  This is like a condominium, but there is no HOA with legal powers.  It is much harder to govern, as the individual unit owners often have to agree unanimously or court intervention is required.\n\nCalifornia statutes recognize three kinds of \"common interest developments\": condominium, townhouse, and community apartment, with the latter being the owned-in-common concept described above.\n\n== By country ==\n\n=== Australia ===\nIn Australia, condominiums are known as \"[[Strata title|strata title schemes]]\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Community title schemes|url=http://www.actpla.act.gov.au/topics/design_build/begin_project/community_titles|work=ACT Planning and Land Authority|publisher=ACT Planning and Land Authority\u2019s (ACTPLA) website}}</ref> or \"community title schemes\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Body Corporate Legislation in Queensland|url=https://www.qld.gov.au/law/housing-and-neighbours/body-corporate/roles-and-responsibility/body-corporate-legislation/|publisher=Queensland Government}}</ref>\n\n=== Canada ===\n{{Main|Condominiums in Canada}}\n\nOne in eight Canadian households lived in condominium dwellings, colloquially known as \"condos\", mostly located in a few census metropolitan areas according to [[Statistics Canada]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/nhs-enm/2011/as-sa/99-014-x/99-014-x2011003_1-eng.cfm|title=Condominium dwellings in Canada|website=www12.statcan.gc.ca}}</ref> Condominiums exist in most parts of Canada though more common in larger cities.

Each owner-tenant directly owns his own apartment; the rest of the building and the ground on which it stands is owned jointly by the apartment owners who execute their joint ownership through an ''owner's association''. The expenses of maintaining the joint property is shared ''pro rata'' among the owners.\n\nAnother 5% of Danish homes are in [[housing cooperative]]s (Danish ''andelsbolig''), which occupy a legal position intermediate between condominiums and [[housing association]]s. The entire property is legally owned by a non-profit corporation in which the tenants own shares; each share carries the right and duty to lease an apartment from the cooperative. Shares can be bought and sold, but often the cooperative's rules strictly limit the price for which they may change hand. (In contrast, condominiums are traded on a free market). Because the official share prices are often lower than the market value and sellers often retain freedom to select whom to sell to, under-the-table payments are common.<ref name=\"danske-boligmarked\"/>\n\nCurrent public policy favors condominiums over housing cooperatives, and recent legislation have aimed at making the latter more condominium-like. For example, since 2005, cooperative shares may be used to secure bank loans. (However, Danish [[Danish mortgage market|mortgage banks]] still may not mortgage individual housing cooperative apartments).\n\n=== England and Wales, UK ===\n{{Main|Commonhold}}\nIn [[England and Wales]], the equivalent of condominium is [[commonhold]], a form of ownership introduced in September 2004. As of 3 June 2009, there were 12 commonhold residential developments comprising 97 units in England and one commonhold residential development, comprising 30 units, in Wales.<ref>[[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]], {{UK Parliament |speaker=[[Michael Wills]] | date=9 June 2009 | place=Written Questions | url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2009-06-09c.278364.h |column=792W |title=Commonhold }}</ref> \"Condominium\" is not a term that is widely used in England and Wales, as commonhold is a creature of statute and comparatively rare, and condominiums are more likely to be found in the form of leaseholds.\n\nIn English law it is not possible to enforce a positive covenant on successive owners of freehold land, other than to maintain a boundary fence, without creating an elaborate trust. A positive covenant is, broadly, one which involves the expenditure of money to perform.\n\nThis did not create a significant problem until the 1950s, when \"flats\" (where ownership is divided horizontally) first began to appear on the market as more affordable particularly for first-time buyers. Until then flats had been confined to short-term unsaleable tenancies, with varying degrees of statutory rent protection and security of tenure.\n\nIt was soon learned that freehold flats were an unsatisfactory form of ownership because it was not possible to impose essential maintenance requirements. As such, flats became virtually unmarketable because they were an unacceptable form of security to lenders. Thus solicitors, the principal property lawyers in England and Wales in those days, began to use leases instead, where such limitations did not apply.\n\nProgress was haphazard and piecemeal, but over time things became more standard. Improvements became universal as institutional lenders refused to advance money on the security of flats unless certain basic provisions were included.  This benefited owners whether or not they borrowed money since purchase was invariably conducted through a solicitor or licensed conveyancer trained to reject leases failing to meet the necessary standards.\n\nDespite these standards, the actual form of leasehold systems is variable. Highly favoured are arrangements where the leases are granted out of a freehold owned by a corporation, itself owned by individual leaseholders. This provides an opportunity for them to participate in the proper management of the block.  Again, quality of management is very variable.\n\nThe statute creating commonholds was motivated by a desire to eliminate some of the problems and perceived injustices, such as the commercial exploitation of \"lessees\" by freeholders as their leases began to have too little time left to satisfy lenders. Since most leasehold developments are undertaken by commercial entities, commonholds did not become widespread. There are, however, other statutes in place that give some degree of protection for leaseholders. It is, nevertheless, essential to consider proper legal advice whenever engaged in the purchase of a flat, for the requirements for a fully marketable flat remain complex.\n\nLaw of Property Act 1925, s.153, contains provisions for the \"enlargement\" of leases into freeholds, one of the effects of which is to preserve the enforceability of positive covenants contained in the lease against the resulting freehold. There are clear, but stringent, requirements. Artificial schemes using the provisions to create enforceable positive covenants in freehold blocks of flats were occasionally mooted but never gained currency.\n\nScotland has a separate legal system from England and Wales and is a separate consideration.\n\n=== Finland ===\nIn [[Finland]], a condominium-like arrangement where the ownership of the real estate is assigned to specific apartments ({{lang-fi|hallinnanjakosopimus}}, {{lang-sv|avtal om delning av besittningen}}) is usually used only with [[single-family detached home|detached]] or [[semi-detached]] houses.\n\nA [[housing cooperative]] is a common form of home ownership in Finland. Owning shares that correspond to one apartment in a housing company is generally considered as much ''owning your own home'' as actually directly owning a (single family) house. However, shares are not considered as [[real estate]] but as [[personal property]] and the co-op can take the possession of the apartment for a term time and evict the tenant or owner because of disturbance or unpaid maintenance fees.\n\nFinnish housing cooperatives are incorporated as (non-profit) [[limited liability company|limited-liability companies]] ({{lang-fi|asunto-[[osakeyhti\u00f6]]}}, {{lang-sv|bostadsaktiebolag}}), where one share usually represents one square meter (sometimes ten) of the apartment.\n\nMembership of a condo is obtained by buying the shares on the open market, most often through a real estate agent. No board approval is needed to buy shares. There is usually no requirement for the owner(s) to live in the condo. Owning of apartments for rent is a common form of saving and private investment in Finland.\n\n=== Germany ===\nIn Germany, Condominiums are known as \"Eigentumswohnung\" and the most important law considering condominiums is the German Condominium Act (WEG). It's the basis for all legal regulations involving individual freehold ownership, the rights, duties of home owner associations and the management of condominiums. The Act dates back to 1951, but it was re-enacted in 2007. Now home owners are invested with partial legal capacity, which means that the [[Homeowner association|home owner association]] represents  an entity with rights and duties that may include contracts. The right of ownership is divided in the first article of the German Condominium Act into homeownership, individual freehold ownership, part ownership and commonhold ownership. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.accentro.co.uk/services/real-estate-glossary/glossary/condominium-act-weg-the-law-governing-all-aspects-of-freehold-ownership-in-germany/ |title=Condominium Act (WEG) |publisher=Accentro.co.uk |accessdate=2018-07-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180719233534/https://www.accentro.co.uk/services/real-estate-glossary/glossary/condominium-act-weg-the-law-governing-all-aspects-of-freehold-ownership-in-germany/ |archive-date=2018-07-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== Hong Kong ===\n{{main|Private housing estates in Hong Kong}}\nCondominiums are known as \"private housing estates\" (as opposed to \"public housing estates\") in Hong Kong.\n\n=== Hungary ===\n[[File:T\u00e1rsash\u00e1z alaprajza (r\u00e9szlet).jpg|thumb|Floor plan of a condo - Andr\u00e1ssy avenue, Budapest]]\n{{unreferenced section| date = January 2013}}\nCondominiums (Hungarian: \"t\u00e1rsash\u00e1z\") were formally introduced in 1924.

Additionally, the owners of the individual units also collectively own the common areas of the property, such as corridors\\hallways, walkways, laundry rooms, etc., as well as common utilities and amenities, such as the [[HVAC]] system, elevators, and so on. Many shopping malls are industrial condominiums in which the individual retail and office spaces are owned by the businesses that occupy them while the common areas of the mall are collectively owned by all the business entities that own the individual spaces.\n\nThe common areas, amenities, and utilities are managed collectively by the owners through their association, such as a [[homeowner association]].\n\nScholars have traced the earliest known use of the condominium form of tenure to a document from first-century [[Babylon]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/02/nyregion/fighting-dog-owners-discourtesy-with-dna-in-brooklyn.html?smid=tw-nytmetro|title=Using DNA to Fight Dog Owners\u2019 Discourtesy in Brooklyn|publisher=}}</ref> The word ''[[Wiktionary:condominium#Latin|condominium]]'' originated in [[Latin]].\n\n[[Italy]] uses ''[[Wiktionary:condominio#Italian|condominio]]'', which is simply the modern Italian form of ''condominium''.

Its meaning is therefore \u2018joint dominion\u2019 or \u2018co-ownership\u2019.\n\n''Condominia'' (the Latin plural of ''condominium'') originally referred to territories over which two or more sovereign powers shared joint sovereignty. This technique was frequently used to settle border disputes when multiple claimants could not agree on how to partition the disputed territory. For example, from 1818 to 1846, [[Oregon Country]] was a condominium over which both the [[United States of America|United States]] and [[Great Britain]] shared joint sovereignty until the [[Oregon Treaty]] resolved the issue by splitting the territory along the 49th parallel and each country gaining sole sovereignty of one side.\n\n== Overview ==\nThe difference between an \"apartment\" complex and condominium is purely legal. There is no way to differentiate a condominium from an apartment simply by looking at or visiting the building. What defines a condominium is the form of ownership. A building developed as a condominium (and ''sold'' in individual units to different ''owners'') could actually be built at another location as an apartment building (the developers would retain ownership and ''rent'' individual units to different ''tenants'').  As a practical matter, builders tend to build condominiums to higher quality standards than apartment complexes because of the differences between the rental and sale markets.\n\nTechnically, a condominium is a collection of individual home units and [[common area]]s along with the land upon which they sit. Individual home ownership within a condominium is construed as ownership of only the air space confining the boundaries of the home. The boundaries of that space are specified by a legal document known as a Declaration, filed on record with the local governing authority. Typically, these boundaries will include the wall surrounding a condo, allowing the homeowner to make some interior modifications without impacting the common area. Anything outside this boundary is held in an undivided ownership interest by a corporation established at the time of the condominium's creation. The corporation holds this property in trust on behalf of the homeowners as a group\u2014it may not have ownership itself.\n\nCondominiums have conditions, covenants, and restrictions, and often additional rules that govern how the individual unit owners are to share the space.\n\nIt is also possible for a condominium to consist of single-family dwellings. There are also \"detached condominiums\" where homeowners do not maintain the exteriors of the dwellings, yards, etc. and \"site condominiums\" where the owner has more control and possibly ownership (as in a \"whole lot\" or \"lot line\" condominium) over the exterior appearance. These structures are preferred by some [[planned neighborhood]]s and [[gated community|gated communities]].\n\n== Homeowners association ==\n\nA [[homeowners association]] (HOA), whose members are the unit owners, manages the condominium through a board of directors elected by the membership. This exists under various names depending on the jurisdiction, such as \"unit title\", \"sectional title\", \"[[commonhold]]\", \"strata council\", or \"[[tenant-owner's association]]\", \"body corporate\", \"Owners Corporation\", \"condominium corporation\" or \"condominium association\". Another variation of this concept is the \"time share\", although not all time shares are condominiums, and not all time shares involve actual ownership of (i.e., deeded title to) real property. Condominiums may be found in both [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] and [[common law]] legal systems as it is purely a creation of [[statute]].  Among other things, the HOA assesses unit owners for the costs of maintaining the common areas, etc.  That is, the HOA decides how much each owner should pay and has the legal power to collect that.\n\n== Unit description ==\n[[File:The Cosmopolitan Singapore.jpg|thumb|The Cosmopolitan, a condominium in [[Singapore]]]]\n\nThe description of the condominium units and the common areas and any restrictions on their use is established in a document commonly called a \"Master Deed\" (also known as the \"Enabling Declaration\", the \"Declaration of Conditions\", or the \"Condominium Document\").  Among other things, this document provides for the creation of the HOA. Rules of governance for the association are usually covered under a separate set of bylaws which generally govern the internal affairs of the condominium. Condominium bylaws usually establish the responsibilities of the owners' association; the voting procedures to be used at [[Deliberative assembly|association meetings]]; the qualifications, powers, and duties of the board of directors; the powers and duties of the officers; and the obligations of the owners with regard to assessments, maintenance, and use of the units and common areas. Finally, a set of rules and regulations providing specific details of restrictions on conduct of unit owners and residents are established by the HOA.<ref name=\"KamanCusimano\">{{cite web|title=Understanding the Government of a Community Association|url=http://www.ohiocondolaw.com/articles/governance_community_assn.htm|publisher=Kaman & Cusimano|accessdate=24 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115041050/http://www.ohiocondolaw.com/articles/governance_community_assn.htm|archive-date=2012-01-15|url-status=dead}}</ref> These are more readily amendable than the declaration or association bylaws, typically requiring only a vote of the HOA board.  Typical rules include mandatory maintenance fees (perhaps collected monthly), pet restrictions, and color/design choices visible from the exterior of the units. Generally, these sets of rules and regulations are made available to residents and or as a matter of public record via a condominium or homeowners association website or through public files, depending on the state and its applicable laws. Condominiums are usually owned in [[fee simple]] [[title]], but can be owned in ways that other [[real estate]] can be owned, such as title held in [[Trust law|trust]]. In some jurisdictions, such as [[Ontario]], Canada or [[Hawaii]] USA, there are \"leasehold condominiums\" where the development is built on leased land.\n\nIn general, condominium unit owners can [[Renting|rent]] their home to [[leasehold estate|tenant]]s, similar to renting out other real estate, although leasing rights may be subject to conditions or restrictions set forth in the declaration (such as a rental cap for the total number of units in a community that can be leased at one time) or otherwise as permitted by local law.\n\n== Non-residential uses ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2016}}\nCondominium ownership is also used, albeit less frequently, for non-residential land uses: offices, hotel rooms, retail shops, private airports, marinas, group housing facilities (retirement homes or dormitories),  bare land (in [[Condominiums in Canada|British Columbia]])) and [[storage condo|storage]]. The legal structure is the same, and many of the benefits are similar; for instance, a nonprofit corporation may face a lower tax liability in an office condominium than in an office rented from a taxable, for-profit company. However, the frequent turnover of commercial land uses in particular can make the inflexibility of condominium arrangements problematic.\n\n== Similar concepts ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}\nThere are many forms of real estate ownership that are similar to condominiums but not identical.\n\nClassic privately owned detached houses on privately owned lots may be part of a community that has a homeowner's association.  Such an association may administer a common park area, for example, or an access road, or architectural standards for the houses.\n\nIn a townhouse complex, multiple physical houses are combined into a single architectural building.  Each unit owner owns an identified plot of land and the building affixed to it, but that building is physically part of a larger building that spans lots.  There is a continuous roof and foundation and a single wall divides adjacent townhouses. If there is an apartment below not owned by owner of townhouse, then it is not a townhouse, just a bi-level apartment/condominium. Legally, this is very similar to detached houses, but because of the intertwining of interests in the single architectural building, a homeowner's association is required.  It would be impractical, for example to replace the roof of just one townhouse.  But unlike the condominium, the townhouse complex's HOA owns none of the building or the land under it.  It is essentially under contract to the townhouse owners to maintain the parts of the building that are hard to divide.  Even the walls between townhouses are usually outside the purview of the HOA, being jointly owned and maintained by the owners of the townhouses on either side.  Like the condominium, the townhouse complex often has common areas for roads, parking, clubhouses, and such.\n\nA rowhouse is like a townhouse except that the houses are not physically connected.  They are independent structures that simply have no space between them.  Technically, they are detached.\n\nA building with multiple residential units may simply be owned in common by multiple people, with each having specific rights to a particular unit and undivided interest in the rest.  This is like a condominium, but there is no HOA with legal powers.

Each owner-tenant directly owns his own apartment; the rest of the building and the ground on which it stands is owned jointly by the apartment owners who execute their joint ownership through an ''owner's association''. The expenses of maintaining the joint property is shared ''pro rata'' among the owners.\n\nAnother 5% of Danish homes are in [[housing cooperative]]s (Danish ''andelsbolig''), which occupy a legal position intermediate between condominiums and [[housing association]]s. The entire property is legally owned by a non-profit corporation in which the tenants own shares; each share carries the right and duty to lease an apartment from the cooperative. Shares can be bought and sold, but often the cooperative's rules strictly limit the price for which they may change hand. (In contrast, condominiums are traded on a free market). Because the official share prices are often lower than the market value and sellers often retain freedom to select whom to sell to, under-the-table payments are common.<ref name=\"danske-boligmarked\"/>\n\nCurrent public policy favors condominiums over housing cooperatives, and recent legislation have aimed at making the latter more condominium-like. For example, since 2005, cooperative shares may be used to secure bank loans. (However, Danish [[Danish mortgage market|mortgage banks]] still may not mortgage individual housing cooperative apartments).\n\n=== England and Wales, UK ===\n{{Main|Commonhold}}\nIn [[England and Wales]], the equivalent of condominium is [[commonhold]], a form of ownership introduced in September 2004. As of 3 June 2009, there were 12 commonhold residential developments comprising 97 units in England and one commonhold residential development, comprising 30 units, in Wales.<ref>[[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]], {{UK Parliament |speaker=[[Michael Wills]] | date=9 June 2009 | place=Written Questions | url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2009-06-09c.278364.h |column=792W |title=Commonhold }}</ref> \"Condominium\" is not a term that is widely used in England and Wales, as commonhold is a creature of statute and comparatively rare, and condominiums are more likely to be found in the form of leaseholds.\n\nIn English law it is not possible to enforce a positive covenant on successive owners of freehold land, other than to maintain a boundary fence, without creating an elaborate trust. A positive covenant is, broadly, one which involves the expenditure of money to perform.\n\nThis did not create a significant problem until the 1950s, when \"flats\" (where ownership is divided horizontally) first began to appear on the market as more affordable particularly for first-time buyers. Until then flats had been confined to short-term unsaleable tenancies, with varying degrees of statutory rent protection and security of tenure.\n\nIt was soon learned that freehold flats were an unsatisfactory form of ownership because it was not possible to impose essential maintenance requirements. As such, flats became virtually unmarketable because they were an unacceptable form of security to lenders. Thus solicitors, the principal property lawyers in England and Wales in those days, began to use leases instead, where such limitations did not apply.\n\nProgress was haphazard and piecemeal, but over time things became more standard. Improvements became universal as institutional lenders refused to advance money on the security of flats unless certain basic provisions were included.  This benefited owners whether or not they borrowed money since purchase was invariably conducted through a solicitor or licensed conveyancer trained to reject leases failing to meet the necessary standards.\n\nDespite these standards, the actual form of leasehold systems is variable. Highly favoured are arrangements where the leases are granted out of a freehold owned by a corporation, itself owned by individual leaseholders. This provides an opportunity for them to participate in the proper management of the block.  Again, quality of management is very variable.\n\nThe statute creating commonholds was motivated by a desire to eliminate some of the problems and perceived injustices, such as the commercial exploitation of \"lessees\" by freeholders as their leases began to have too little time left to satisfy lenders. Since most leasehold developments are undertaken by commercial entities, commonholds did not become widespread. There are, however, other statutes in place that give some degree of protection for leaseholders. It is, nevertheless, essential to consider proper legal advice whenever engaged in the purchase of a flat, for the requirements for a fully marketable flat remain complex.\n\nLaw of Property Act 1925, s.153, contains provisions for the \"enlargement\" of leases into freeholds, one of the effects of which is to preserve the enforceability of positive covenants contained in the lease against the resulting freehold. There are clear, but stringent, requirements. Artificial schemes using the provisions to create enforceable positive covenants in freehold blocks of flats were occasionally mooted but never gained currency.\n\nScotland has a separate legal system from England and Wales and is a separate consideration.\n\n=== Finland ===\nIn [[Finland]], a condominium-like arrangement where the ownership of the real estate is assigned to specific apartments ({{lang-fi|hallinnanjakosopimus}}, {{lang-sv|avtal om delning av besittningen}}) is usually used only with [[single-family detached home|detached]] or [[semi-detached]] houses.\n\nA [[housing cooperative]] is a common form of home ownership in Finland. Owning shares that correspond to one apartment in a housing company is generally considered as much ''owning your own home'' as actually directly owning a (single family) house. However, shares are not considered as [[real estate]] but as [[personal property]] and the co-op can take the possession of the apartment for a term time and evict the tenant or owner because of disturbance or unpaid maintenance fees.\n\nFinnish housing cooperatives are incorporated as (non-profit) [[limited liability company|limited-liability companies]] ({{lang-fi|asunto-[[osakeyhti\u00f6]]}}, {{lang-sv|bostadsaktiebolag}}), where one share usually represents one square meter (sometimes ten) of the apartment.\n\nMembership of a condo is obtained by buying the shares on the open market, most often through a real estate agent. No board approval is needed to buy shares. There is usually no requirement for the owner(s) to live in the condo. Owning of apartments for rent is a common form of saving and private investment in Finland.\n\n=== Germany ===\nIn Germany, Condominiums are known as \"Eigentumswohnung\" and the most important law considering condominiums is the German Condominium Act (WEG). It's the basis for all legal regulations involving individual freehold ownership, the rights, duties of home owner associations and the management of condominiums. The Act dates back to 1951, but it was re-enacted in 2007. Now home owners are invested with partial legal capacity, which means that the [[Homeowner association|home owner association]] represents  an entity with rights and duties that may include contracts. The right of ownership is divided in the first article of the German Condominium Act into homeownership, individual freehold ownership, part ownership and commonhold ownership. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.accentro.co.uk/services/real-estate-glossary/glossary/condominium-act-weg-the-law-governing-all-aspects-of-freehold-ownership-in-germany/ |title=Condominium Act (WEG) |publisher=Accentro.co.uk |accessdate=2018-07-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180719233534/https://www.accentro.co.uk/services/real-estate-glossary/glossary/condominium-act-weg-the-law-governing-all-aspects-of-freehold-ownership-in-germany/ |archive-date=2018-07-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== Hong Kong ===\n{{main|Private housing estates in Hong Kong}}\nCondominiums are known as \"private housing estates\" (as opposed to \"public housing estates\") in Hong Kong.\n\n=== Hungary ===\n[[File:T\u00e1rsash\u00e1z alaprajza (r\u00e9szlet).jpg|thumb|Floor plan of a condo - Andr\u00e1ssy avenue, Budapest]]\n{{unreferenced section| date = January 2013}}\nCondominiums (Hungarian: \"t\u00e1rsash\u00e1z\") were formally introduced in 1924.

The condominium acts as a non-profit legal entity maintaining the common areas of the property, and is managed by a representative elected by the owners' convention.\n\nDecisions that involve changes to the terms and conditions, or larger common expenses need to be approved by the convention, where voting power is based on the percentage of property owned.<ref>Condominium act, 1997 - http://www.justiceservices.gov.mt/DownloadDocument.aspx?app=lp&itemid=26458&l=1   20180608</ref>\n\nActually, condominium is a frequent legal form of housing in Hungarian cities where  privatization of state or municipality-owned flats were effected mainly in the 1990s.\n\n=== India ===\nIn India, condominiums are known as \"Apartments\" or \"Apartment Buildings/Complexes\" or \"Societies\" or \"Flats\".

Major global surveys were conducted by [[Mariner 9]] and ''[[Viking 1]]'' and two orbiters, which supported the Viking landers. Later orbiters, such as ''[[Mars Global Surveyor]]'', ''[[2001 Mars Odyssey]]'', ''[[Mars Express]]'', and ''[[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]]'', have mapped Mars in higher resolution with improved instruments. These later surveys have identified the probable locations of water, a critical resource.{{citation_needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n===Funding===\nThe largest limiting factor for sending humans to Mars is funding.

However, this proved to be both wasteful and unsustainable, and the current climate is one of international cooperation, with large projects such as the [[International Space Station]] and the proposed [[Lunar Gateway]] being built and launched by multiple countries.{{citation_needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nCritics argue that the immediate benefits of establishing a human presence on Mars are outweighed by the immense cost, and that funds could be better redirected towards other programs, such as robotic exploration. Proponents of human space exploration contend that the symbolism of establishing a presence in space may garner public interest to join the cause and spark global cooperation.

Orion was intended to have the ability to transport extremely large payloads compared to chemical rocketry, making crewed missions to Mars and the outer planets feasible. One of the early vehicle designs was intended to send an 800-ton payload to Mars orbit.

Although the EMPIRE missions were never proposed for funding, they were the first detailed analyses of what it would take to accomplish a human voyage to Mars using data from actual NASA spaceflight, laying the basis for future studies, including significant mission studies by TRW, North American, Philco, Lockheed, Douglas, and General Dynamics, along with several in-house NASA studies.<ref name=\"platoff\" />\n\nFollowing the success of the [[Apollo Program]], von Braun advocated a crewed mission to Mars as a focus for NASA's crewed space program.<ref>Wernher von Braun, \"Manned Mars Landing Presentation to the Space Task Group,\" presentation materials, August 1969 (referenced by Portree'', 2001 op cit''.</ref> Von Braun's proposal used [[Saturn V]] boosters to launch [[NERVA]]-powered upper stages that would propel two six-crew spacecraft on a dual mission in the early 1980s.

The Soviets sent many probes to Mars with some noted success stories including Mars atmospheric entry, but the overall rate of success was low.{{citation_needed|date=June 2019}} (see [[Mars 3]])\n\n[[TMK|Heavy Interplanetary Spacecraft]] (known by the Russian acronym '''TMK''') was the designation of a Soviet Union space exploration proposal in the 1960s to send a crewed flight to Mars and Venus (TMK-MAVR design) without landing. The TMK spacecraft was due to launch in 1971 and make a three-year-long flight including a Mars fly-by at which time probes would have been dropped. The project was never completed because the required [[N1 rocket]] never flew successfully. The ''Mars Expeditionary Complex'', or \"'MEK\"' (1969) was another Soviet proposal for a Mars expedition that would take a crew from three to six to Mars and back with a total mission duration of 630 days.\n\n==== Case for Mars (1981\u20131996) ====\nFollowing the [[Viking program|Viking]] missions to Mars, between 1981 and 1996 a series of conferences named The Case for Mars were held at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]]. These conferences advocated human exploration of Mars, presented concepts and technologies, and held a series of workshops to develop a baseline concept for the mission. It proposed use of [[in-situ resource utilization]] to manufacture rocket propellant for the return trip. The mission study was published in a series of proceedings volumes.<ref>Penelope J.

This resulted in a report, called the ''90-day study'',<ref>NASA, ''Report of the 90-day study on human exploration of the Moon and Mars'', published 11/1989; [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1989STIN...9127055. abstract]</ref> in which the agency proposed a long-term plan consisting of completing the Space Station as \"a critical next step in all our space endeavors,\" returning to the Moon and establishing a permanent base, and then sending astronauts to Mars. This report was widely criticized as too elaborate and expensive, and all funding for human exploration beyond Earth orbit was canceled by Congress.<ref>Dwayne Day, \"Aiming for Mars, grounded on Earth,\" ''The Space Review'' February 16, 2004 [http://www.thespacereview.com/article/102/1 link]</ref>\n\n==== Mars Direct (early 1990s) ====\n{{Main|Mars Direct}}\nBecause of the greater distance, the Mars mission would be much more risky and expensive than past Moon flights. Supplies and fuel would have to be prepared for a 2-3 year round trip and the spacecraft would need at least partial shielding from ionizing radiation. A 1990 paper by [[Robert Zubrin]] and David A. Baker, then of [[Martin Marietta]], proposed reducing the mission mass (and hence the cost) by using [[in situ resource utilization#Mars|in situ resource utilization]] to manufacture propellant from the Martian Atmosphere.<ref>R.

The '2-4-2' concept is based on a reduction of the crew size to 2 astronauts and the duplication of the entire mission. There are 2 astronauts in each space vehicle, there are 4 on the surface of Mars and there are 2 once again in each return vehicle. If one set of hardware runs into trouble, there are 2 astronauts ready to help the 2 others (2 for 2). This architecture simplifies the entry, descent and landing procedures by reducing the size of the landing vehicles. It also avoids the assembly of huge vehicles in LEO. The author claims that his proposal is much cheaper than the NASA reference mission without compromising the risks and can be undertaken before 2030.<ref>Jean-Marc Salotti, Acta Astronautica, Volume 69, Issues 5\u20136, September\u2013October 2011, Pages 266\u2013279.</ref><ref>Jean-Marc Salotti, Acta Astronautica, Volume 81, Issue 1, December 2012.</ref>\n\n==== Boeing Conceptual Space Vehicle Architecture (2012) ====\nIn 2012, a conceptual architecture was published by [[Boeing]], [[United Launch Alliance]], and RAL Space in Britain, laying out a possible design for a crewed Mars mission. Components of the architecture include various spacecraft for the Earth-to-Mars journey, landing, and surface stay as well as return. Some features include several uncrewed cargo landers assembled into a base on the surface of Mars. The crew would land at this base in the \"Mars Personnel Lander\", which could also take them back into Mars orbit. The design for the crewed interplanetary spacecraft included artificial gravity and an artificial magnetic field for radiation protection. Overall, the architecture was modular to allow for incremental R&D.<ref name=mars>{{Cite book |title= Conceptual Space Vehicle Architecture for Human Exploration of Mars, with Artificial Gravity and Mini-Magnetosphere Crew Radiation Shield |doi= 10.2514/6.2012-5114|year = 2012|last1 = Benton|first1 = Mark|last2=Kutter |first2=Bernard |last3=Bamford |first3=Ruth |last4=Bingham |first4=Bob |last5=Todd |first5=Tom |last6=Stafford-Allen |first6=Robin |isbn=978-1-60086-940-2 }}</ref>\n\n==== Mars One (2012-2019) ====\n{{Main|Mars One}}\nIn 2012, a [[The Netherlands|Dutch]] entrepreneur group began raising funds for a human Mars base to be established in 2023.<ref name=adario>{{cite web |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2405162,00.asp\n |title=Dutch Group Planning for Mars Settlement by 2023\n |work=PCMAG |accessdate=12 June 2015}}</ref> The mission was intended to be primarily a one-way trip to Mars.

The proposed [[Lunar Gateway]] would test deep space habitation facilities, and validate capabilities required for human exploration of Mars.\n\nFinally, phase three is the transition to independence from Earth resources. The \"Earth Independent\" phase includes long term missions on the lunar surface with surface habitats that only require routine maintenance, and the harvesting of Martian resources for fuel, water, and building materials. NASA is still aiming for human missions to Mars in the 2030s, though Earth independence could take decades longer.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/journey-to-mars-next-steps-20151008_508.pdf\n |title=NASA's Journey To Mars: Pioneering Next Steps in Space Exploration\n |date=October 8, 2015 |accessdate=October 10, 2015 |website=Nasa.gov |publisher=NASA }}</ref>\n\nIn November 2015, Administrator Bolden of NASA reaffirmed the goal of sending humans to Mars.<ref name=bolden>{{cite web|url=http://www.marsdaily.com/reports/NASA_Chief_Were_Closer_to_Sending_Humans_on_Mars_Than_Ever_Before_999.html|title=NASA Chief: We're Closer to Sending Humans on Mars Than Ever Before|website=Marsdaily.com}}</ref> He laid out 2030 as the date of a crewed surface landing, and noted that planned 2020 Mars rover would support the human mission.<ref name=bolden />\n\nIn March 2019, Vice President Mike Pence declared \"American Astronauts will walk on the Moon again before the end of 2024, \"by any means necessary\".\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/26/science/nasa-moon-pence.html|title=The Trump Administration Wants Astronauts on Moon by 2024.

Proponents of human space exploration contend that the symbolism of establishing a presence in space may garner public interest to join the cause and spark global cooperation.

The '2-4-2' concept is based on a reduction of the crew size to 2 astronauts and the duplication of the entire mission. There are 2 astronauts in each space vehicle, there are 4 on the surface of Mars and there are 2 once again in each return vehicle. If one set of hardware runs into trouble, there are 2 astronauts ready to help the 2 others (2 for 2). This architecture simplifies the entry, descent and landing procedures by reducing the size of the landing vehicles. It also avoids the assembly of huge vehicles in LEO. The author claims that his proposal is much cheaper than the NASA reference mission without compromising the risks and can be undertaken before 2030.<ref>Jean-Marc Salotti, Acta Astronautica, Volume 69, Issues 5\u20136, September\u2013October 2011, Pages 266\u2013279.</ref><ref>Jean-Marc Salotti, Acta Astronautica, Volume 81, Issue 1, December 2012.</ref>\n\n==== Boeing Conceptual Space Vehicle Architecture (2012) ====\nIn 2012, a conceptual architecture was published by [[Boeing]], [[United Launch Alliance]], and RAL Space in Britain, laying out a possible design for a crewed Mars mission.

Some features include several uncrewed cargo landers assembled into a base on the surface of Mars. The crew would land at this base in the \"Mars Personnel Lander\", which could also take them back into Mars orbit.

A trademark may be eligible for registration, or '''registrable''', if it performs the essential trademark function, and has '''distinctive character'''. Registrability can be understood as a continuum, with \"inherently distinctive\" marks at one end, \"generic\" and \"descriptive\" marks with no distinctive character at the other end, and \"suggestive\" and \"arbitrary\" marks lying between these two points. \"Descriptive\" marks must acquire distinctiveness through secondary meaning\u2014consumers have come to recognize the mark as a source indicator\u2014to be protectable.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Battersby, Gregory J.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/51098248|title=Trademark & copyright disputes : litigation forms and analysis|date=2003-|publisher=Aspen Publishers|others=Grimes, Charles W.|isbn=0-7355-3515-9|location=New York, NY|oclc=51098248}}</ref> \"Generic\" terms are used to refer to the product or service itself and cannot be used as trademarks.\n\n==The spectrum of distinctiveness==\n\nIn [[United States trademark law]], [[Abercrombie & Fitch Co. v.

Invented marks are [[neologism]]s which will not previously have been found in any [[dictionary]].\n\n===Arbitrary marks===\nAn '''arbitrary''' trademark is usually a common word which is used in a meaningless context (e.g. \"[[Apple Inc.|Apple]]\" for computers). Such marks consist of words or images which have some dictionary meaning before being adopted as trademarks, but which are used in connection with products or services unrelated to that dictionary meaning. Arbitrary marks are also immediately eligible for registration. ''Salty'' would be an arbitrary mark if it used in connection with e.g. telephones such as in ''Salty Telephones'', as the term \"[[salt]]\" has no particular connection with such products.\n\n===Suggestive marks===\nA '''suggestive''' mark tends to indicate the nature, quality, or a characteristic of the products or services in relation to which it is used, but does not describe this characteristic, and requires imagination on the part of the consumer to identify the characteristic. Suggestive marks invoke the consumer\u2019s perceptive imagination. Examples of a suggestive mark are [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]], a new technology of high-capacity data storage that utilizes a \"blue\" (actually [[Violet (color)|violet]]) [[laser]] and [[Airbus]], an aerospace corporation manufacturing commercial aircraft.\n\n===Descriptive marks===\nA '''descriptive''' mark is a term with a dictionary meaning which is used in connection with products or services directly related to that meaning.<ref name=\":0\" /> An example might be ''Salty'' used in connection with saltine crackers or anchovies. Such terms are not registrable unless it attains a 'secondary meaning'. A secondary meaning means that a mark is so distinctive that people are associated it with specific brand name in the [[marketplace]] (see further below).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.marksgray.com/mean-merely-descriptive-trademark/|title=What Does It Mean to Have a \u201cMerely Descriptive\u201d Trademark?|date=2018-06-07|website=Marks Gray|language=en|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> [[Lektronic]] was famously refused protection by the USPTO on the grounds of being descriptive for electronic goods. While, Sharp, a Japanese electronic manufacturer, is protectable as a descriptive trademark.

But when you capitalize the word \"Sharp\", people will immediately recognize it as a specific TV/electronic brand.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.inta.org/TrademarkBasics/FactSheets/Pages/TrademarkStrengthFactSheet.aspx|title=Trademark Strength|website=www.inta.org|language=en-us|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> \n\n===Generic terms===\n{{Redirect|Generic term|other possible uses and contexts|Generic (disambiguation){{!}}Generic}}\nA '''generic term''' is the common name for the products or services in connection with which it is used, such as \"salt\" when used in connection with sodium chloride. A generic term is not capable of serving the essential trademark function of distinguishing the products or services of a business from the products or services of other businesses, and therefore cannot be afforded any legal protection.<ref name=\":0\" /> This is because there has to be some term which may generally be used by anyone\u2014including other manufacturers\u2014to refer to a product without using some organization's proprietary trademark. Marks which become generic after losing distinctive character are known as [[genericized trademark]]s. Marks which are a misspelling of a generic term (e.g., the elimination of a space) do not change the generic significance of the term.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/com/sol/foia/ttab/other/2005/76219917.pdf|title= In re NetEnterprise, Inc., Serial No. 76219917|work=USPTO|language=en|date=2005-04-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thettablog.blogspot.com/2005/05/netenterprise-generic-for-internet.html|title='NETENTERPRISE' Generic For An Internet Business, Says TTAB|work=TTABlog|language=en|date=2005-05-17}}</ref> Aspirin tablet is a registered trademark by Bayer AG.

Avoiding the \"Genericide\" Headache in the United States|website=www.inta.org|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref>\n\n==Assessing distinctiveness==\nIn trademark litigation, courts are most frequently asked to distinguish between ''suggestive'' and ''descriptive'' marks on the one hand, and between ''descriptive'' and ''generic'' marks on the other. This is because suggestive marks, like fanciful and arbitrary marks, are presumed to be entitled to trademark protection, while descriptive marks are entitled to protection if they have become known as representing the producer of the goods, and generic marks can never receive protection. It can be seen from the examples above that the distinctive character of a term is closely related to the products or services in relation to which the term is used.\n\nA general method for assessing the distinctive character of a mark is to consider a consumer's reaction to a mark.<ref name=\":0\" /> The mark may only be inherently registrable if the consumer has never encountered the mark before. On the other hand, the mark is unlikely to be inherently registrable if it informs him about any characteristic of the relevant products or services (e.g. whether they are delicious, large, spicy, black, or sweet, in the case of fruit). In any other case the mark may not be registrable.\n\nAnother example of a descriptive mark would be a geographical word or phrase that merely indicates the origin of the product or service. For example, [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] based [[ice cream]] might find that the name \"Houston ice cream\" is denied trademark protection on the grounds that the word Houston is merely descriptive. However, they might have better luck with the name \"North Pole ice cream\". In the latter case, although North Pole is a geographical location, the ice cream is not actually made at the [[North Pole]], and no reasonable person would assume that the phrase North Pole is literally descriptive.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.findlaw.com/12international/countries/nz/articles/482.html| publisher= Findlaw|title=Trading on a good name| first=Baldwin Shelston| last= Waters|author2=Angela Sutton |date=July 2001}}</ref>\n\nTherefore marks that identify or describe a product or service, or that are in common use, or that are used as [[geographical indication]]s, generally cannot be registered as trademarks, and remain in the [[public domain]] for use by anyone.<ref name=\":0\" /> For example, a generic term such as \"apple\", or descriptive terms such as \"red\" or \"juicy\" could not be registered in relation to apples.\n\nPrimary consideration in the selection and use of trademarks should be given to marks which are inherently distinctive, as they possess the strongest distinctive character and do not require evidence of use to establish acquired distinctiveness. A fanciful, arbitrary, or suggestive term can be inherently distinctive and registrable without proof of acquired distinctiveness.\nAlthough these categories are most easily applied in relation to trademarks comprising words, the same general principles are applied in relation to all kinds of trademarks. For example, a pine tree shape is descriptive when used on pine-scented products.\n\n===Acquired distinctiveness===\nA trademark with no distinctive character (i.e. a mark which is not inherently distinctive) is [[prima facie]] unregistrable.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Great Britain. Patent Office.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/2647046|title=A century of trade marks : a commentary on the work and history of the Trade Marks Registry, which celebrates its centenary in 1976|date=1976|publisher=H.M.S.O|others=Moorby, R. L., Myall, D. G. A., Dyer, F. J. Ward.|isbn=0-11-511719-9|location=London|oclc=2647046}}</ref> However, most jurisdictions may still allow such marks to be registered if the trademark owner can demonstrate, typically by reference to '''evidence of use''', that consumers in the marketplace exclusively associate the mark, as used on the identified goods or in connection with the identified services, with a particular commercial origin or source (i.e. the trademark owner). \"Use\" may include authorized use by a licensee or other party. If the trade mark office is satisfied that the evidence demonstrates that a mark has \"acquired\" distinctive character ''as a [[de facto|matter of fact]]'', then the mark may be accepted for registration on the basis of '''acquired distinctiveness'''.\n\nThe nature and extent of acceptable evidence of use varies between jurisdictions, although the most useful evidence usually includes sales figures, details of advertising and promotional expenditure, and examples of promotional material. Consumer surveys may also help establish that consumers chiefly associate an otherwise non-distinctive mark with the trademark owner and its products or services. Generally, evidence of use may only be acceptable or relevant if it covers a certain period of time (e.g. three years prior to the filing date of the trademark application) and originates from within the jurisdiction where registration is sought.\n\nThe terminology of acquired distinctiveness is accepted in the [[European Union]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] jurisdictions such as [[Australia]], [[Hong Kong]] and the [[United Kingdom]], and the common law jurisdiction of the [[United States]] (which also uses the term '''secondary meaning'''). In the U.S., if a trademark has been used for a continuous period of at least five years after the date of registration, the right to use the mark and the registration may become \"incontestable\" (e.g. invulnerable to cancellation for non-use, but not for becoming [[Genericized trademark|generic]]). In such cases the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|USPTO]] checks and confirms whether the request for incontestability meets formality requirements, but whether a registration is incontestable at law can only be determined during legal proceedings involving the registration.\n\nThe essential function of a trademark is to exclusively identify the commercial source or origin of products or services, such that a trademark, properly called, indicates source or serves as a badge of origin. The use of a trademark in this way is known as trademark use. Certain exclusive rights attach to a registered mark, which can be enforced by way of an action for trademark infringement, while unregistered trademark rights may be enforced pursuant to the common law tort of [[passing off]].\n\nTrademark rights generally arise out of the use and/or registration (see below) of a mark in connection only with a specific type or range of products or services. Although it may sometimes be possible to take legal action to prevent the use of a mark in relation to products or services outside this range (e.g. for passing off), this does not mean that trademark law prevents the use of that mark by the general public. A common word, phrase, or other sign can only be removed from the public domain to the extent that a trademark owner is able to maintain exclusive rights over that sign in relation to certain products or services, assuming there are no other trademark objections. For a case study in both concepts, see ''[[Apple Corps v Apple Computer]].''\n\n===Maintaining distinctiveness===\nIf a court rules that a trademark has become \"[[genericized trademark|generic]]\" through common use (such that the mark no longer performs the essential trademark function and the average consumer no longer considers that exclusive rights attach to it), the corresponding registration may also be ruled invalid.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFor example, the [[Bayer]] company's trademark \"[[Aspirin]]\" has been ruled generic in the United States, so other companies may use that name for [[acetylsalicylic acid]] as well (although it is still a trademark in [[Canada]]). [[Xerox]] for photocopiers and [[Band-Aid]] for adhesive bandages are both trademarks which are at risk of succumbing to death by becoming declared generic in certain countries, something that the respective trademark owners actively seek to prevent. In order to prevent marks becoming generic, trademark owners often contact those who appear to be using the trademark incorrectly, from web page authors to dictionary editors, and request that they cease the improper usage.\n\nThe proper use of a trademark means using the mark as an [[adjective]], not as a [[noun]] or a [[verb]],<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.inta.org/index.php?option=com_simplefaq&task=display&Itemid=60&catid=284&page=1&getcontent=1#FAQ75| publisher=[[International Trademark Association]]| title= How Do I Use a Trademark Properly?| work=Information and Publishing FAQ| accessdate=2006-09-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.3com.com/corpinfo/en_US/legal/trademark/prop_usage_tmb.html#1| title=Always Use a Trademark as an Adjective, Followed by the Appropriate Noun Descriptor(s)| publisher=3Com Legal| work=Trademarks and Brands| accessdate=2006-09-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.adobe.com/misc/trade.html| title=Permissions and trademark guidelines| publisher=Adobe| accessdate=2006-09-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000943.html | title=A Guide to Proper Trademark Use | author=Pullum, Geoffrey K.  | accessdate=2006-12-05 | work= }}</ref> though for certain trademarks, use as nouns and, less commonly, verbs is common. For example, [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]] sent e-mails to many web authors using the term \"[[photoshopped]]\" telling them that they should only use the term \"modified by Adobe\u00ae Photoshop\u00ae software.\"  Xerox has also purchased print advertisements declaring that \"you cannot 'xerox' a document, but you can copy it on a Xerox Brand copying on machine.\" Another popular example is the use of the word \"[[frappuccino]]\" by [[Starbucks]] customers to mean any blended coffee beverage, though employees are instructed to only say \"frappuccino blended coffee\" or \"frappuccino blended cream\" when referring to such drinks. This rule is not hard-and-fast, however; for example, Lexis-Nexis has a U.S. trademark registration for \"Shepardize,\" [http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&entry=74120780 Reg. No. 1743711], and defines \"Shepardizing on a web page as \"the process of looking up citations\" in \"a series of books called Shepard's Citations.\"<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2019-09-12|title=Farewell to Zimmerman\u2019s Research Guide|url=https://www.lexisnexis.com/infopro/keeping-current/b/weblog/archive/2015/12/10/farewell-to-zimmerman-s-research-guide.aspx|website=www.lexisnexis.com}}</ref> Such efforts may or may not be successful in preventing genericism in the long run, which depends less on the mark owner's efforts and more on how the public actually perceives and uses the mark. In fact, legally it is more important that the trademark holder visibly and actively seems to attempt to prevent its trademark from becoming generic, regardless of real success.{{cn|date=January 2016}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ghost mark]]s\n* [[:wikt:Transwiki:Glossary of legal terms in technology|Glossary of legal terms in technology]]\n* [[International Trademark Association]]\n* [[Madrid system]]\n* [[Proper adjective]]\n* [[Service mark]]s\n* [[Trade dress]]\n* [[Trademark attorney]]\n* [[Trademark dilution]]\n* [[Unregistered trademark]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary|trademark}}\n{{Wikibooks|US Trademark Law}}\n* Canadian Trademark Law [https://web.archive.org/web/20080918044116/http://www.crollco.com/FAQs.php FAQ]\n\n{{Trademark law}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Trademark Distinctiveness}}\n[[Category:Brand management]]\n[[Category:Intellectual property law]]\n[[Category:Product management]]\n[[Category:Trademark law|Distinctiveness]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{Refimprove|date=May 2010}}\n{{Globalize|date=November 2011}}\n}}\n  \n'''Trademark distinctiveness''' is an important concept in the law governing [[trademark]]s and [[service mark]]s.

For example, [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] based [[ice cream]] might find that the name \"Houston ice cream\" is denied trademark protection on the grounds that the word Houston is merely descriptive. However, they might have better luck with the name \"North Pole ice cream\". In the latter case, although North Pole is a geographical location, the ice cream is not actually made at the [[North Pole]], and no reasonable person would assume that the phrase North Pole is literally descriptive.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.findlaw.com/12international/countries/nz/articles/482.html| publisher= Findlaw|title=Trading on a good name| first=Baldwin Shelston| last= Waters|author2=Angela Sutton |date=July 2001}}</ref>\n\nTherefore marks that identify or describe a product or service, or that are in common use, or that are used as [[geographical indication]]s, generally cannot be registered as trademarks, and remain in the [[public domain]] for use by anyone.<ref name=\":0\" /> For example, a generic term such as \"apple\", or descriptive terms such as \"red\" or \"juicy\" could not be registered in relation to apples.\n\nPrimary consideration in the selection and use of trademarks should be given to marks which are inherently distinctive, as they possess the strongest distinctive character and do not require evidence of use to establish acquired distinctiveness. A fanciful, arbitrary, or suggestive term can be inherently distinctive and registrable without proof of acquired distinctiveness.\nAlthough these categories are most easily applied in relation to trademarks comprising words, the same general principles are applied in relation to all kinds of trademarks. For example, a pine tree shape is descriptive when used on pine-scented products.\n\n===Acquired distinctiveness===\nA trademark with no distinctive character (i.e. a mark which is not inherently distinctive) is [[prima facie]] unregistrable.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Great Britain.

L., Myall, D. G. A., Dyer, F. J. Ward.|isbn=0-11-511719-9|location=London|oclc=2647046}}</ref> However, most jurisdictions may still allow such marks to be registered if the trademark owner can demonstrate, typically by reference to '''evidence of use''', that consumers in the marketplace exclusively associate the mark, as used on the identified goods or in connection with the identified services, with a particular commercial origin or source (i.e. the trademark owner). \"Use\" may include authorized use by a licensee or other party. If the trade mark office is satisfied that the evidence demonstrates that a mark has \"acquired\" distinctive character ''as a [[de facto|matter of fact]]'', then the mark may be accepted for registration on the basis of '''acquired distinctiveness'''.\n\nThe nature and extent of acceptable evidence of use varies between jurisdictions, although the most useful evidence usually includes sales figures, details of advertising and promotional expenditure, and examples of promotional material. Consumer surveys may also help establish that consumers chiefly associate an otherwise non-distinctive mark with the trademark owner and its products or services. Generally, evidence of use may only be acceptable or relevant if it covers a certain period of time (e.g. three years prior to the filing date of the trademark application) and originates from within the jurisdiction where registration is sought.\n\nThe terminology of acquired distinctiveness is accepted in the [[European Union]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] jurisdictions such as [[Australia]], [[Hong Kong]] and the [[United Kingdom]], and the common law jurisdiction of the [[United States]] (which also uses the term '''secondary meaning'''). In the U.S., if a trademark has been used for a continuous period of at least five years after the date of registration, the right to use the mark and the registration may become \"incontestable\" (e.g. invulnerable to cancellation for non-use, but not for becoming [[Genericized trademark|generic]]). In such cases the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|USPTO]] checks and confirms whether the request for incontestability meets formality requirements, but whether a registration is incontestable at law can only be determined during legal proceedings involving the registration.\n\nThe essential function of a trademark is to exclusively identify the commercial source or origin of products or services, such that a trademark, properly called, indicates source or serves as a badge of origin. The use of a trademark in this way is known as trademark use. Certain exclusive rights attach to a registered mark, which can be enforced by way of an action for trademark infringement, while unregistered trademark rights may be enforced pursuant to the common law tort of [[passing off]].\n\nTrademark rights generally arise out of the use and/or registration (see below) of a mark in connection only with a specific type or range of products or services. Although it may sometimes be possible to take legal action to prevent the use of a mark in relation to products or services outside this range (e.g. for passing off), this does not mean that trademark law prevents the use of that mark by the general public. A common word, phrase, or other sign can only be removed from the public domain to the extent that a trademark owner is able to maintain exclusive rights over that sign in relation to certain products or services, assuming there are no other trademark objections. For a case study in both concepts, see ''[[Apple Corps v Apple Computer]].''\n\n===Maintaining distinctiveness===\nIf a court rules that a trademark has become \"[[genericized trademark|generic]]\" through common use (such that the mark no longer performs the essential trademark function and the average consumer no longer considers that exclusive rights attach to it), the corresponding registration may also be ruled invalid.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFor example, the [[Bayer]] company's trademark \"[[Aspirin]]\" has been ruled generic in the United States, so other companies may use that name for [[acetylsalicylic acid]] as well (although it is still a trademark in [[Canada]]). [[Xerox]] for photocopiers and [[Band-Aid]] for adhesive bandages are both trademarks which are at risk of succumbing to death by becoming declared generic in certain countries, something that the respective trademark owners actively seek to prevent. In order to prevent marks becoming generic, trademark owners often contact those who appear to be using the trademark incorrectly, from web page authors to dictionary editors, and request that they cease the improper usage.\n\nThe proper use of a trademark means using the mark as an [[adjective]], not as a [[noun]] or a [[verb]],<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.inta.org/index.php?option=com_simplefaq&task=display&Itemid=60&catid=284&page=1&getcontent=1#FAQ75| publisher=[[International Trademark Association]]| title= How Do I Use a Trademark Properly?| work=Information and Publishing FAQ| accessdate=2006-09-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.3com.com/corpinfo/en_US/legal/trademark/prop_usage_tmb.html#1| title=Always Use a Trademark as an Adjective, Followed by the Appropriate Noun Descriptor(s)| publisher=3Com Legal| work=Trademarks and Brands| accessdate=2006-09-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.adobe.com/misc/trade.html| title=Permissions and trademark guidelines| publisher=Adobe| accessdate=2006-09-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000943.html | title=A Guide to Proper Trademark Use | author=Pullum, Geoffrey K.  | accessdate=2006-12-05 | work= }}</ref> though for certain trademarks, use as nouns and, less commonly, verbs is common. For example, [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]] sent e-mails to many web authors using the term \"[[photoshopped]]\" telling them that they should only use the term \"modified by Adobe\u00ae Photoshop\u00ae software.\"  Xerox has also purchased print advertisements declaring that \"you cannot 'xerox' a document, but you can copy it on a Xerox Brand copying on machine.\" Another popular example is the use of the word \"[[frappuccino]]\" by [[Starbucks]] customers to mean any blended coffee beverage, though employees are instructed to only say \"frappuccino blended coffee\" or \"frappuccino blended cream\" when referring to such drinks. This rule is not hard-and-fast, however; for example, Lexis-Nexis has a U.S. trademark registration for \"Shepardize,\" [http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&entry=74120780 Reg. No. 1743711], and defines \"Shepardizing on a web page as \"the process of looking up citations\" in \"a series of books called Shepard's Citations.\"<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2019-09-12|title=Farewell to Zimmerman\u2019s Research Guide|url=https://www.lexisnexis.com/infopro/keeping-current/b/weblog/archive/2015/12/10/farewell-to-zimmerman-s-research-guide.aspx|website=www.lexisnexis.com}}</ref> Such efforts may or may not be successful in preventing genericism in the long run, which depends less on the mark owner's efforts and more on how the public actually perceives and uses the mark. In fact, legally it is more important that the trademark holder visibly and actively seems to attempt to prevent its trademark from becoming generic, regardless of real success.{{cn|date=January 2016}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ghost mark]]s\n* [[:wikt:Transwiki:Glossary of legal terms in technology|Glossary of legal terms in technology]]\n* [[International Trademark Association]]\n* [[Madrid system]]\n* [[Proper adjective]]\n* [[Service mark]]s\n* [[Trade dress]]\n* [[Trademark attorney]]\n* [[Trademark dilution]]\n* [[Unregistered trademark]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary|trademark}}\n{{Wikibooks|US Trademark Law}}\n* Canadian Trademark Law [https://web.archive.org/web/20080918044116/http://www.crollco.com/FAQs.php FAQ]\n\n{{Trademark law}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Trademark Distinctiveness}}\n[[Category:Brand management]]\n[[Category:Intellectual property law]]\n[[Category:Product management]]\n[[Category:Trademark law|Distinctiveness]]\n", "name_user": "Msel20", "label": "safe", "comment": "Add citations", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark_distinctiveness"}
