{"title_page": "Mechanical screening", "text_new": "'''Mechanical screening''', often just called '''screening''', is the practice of taking [[Granule (geology)|granulated]] [[ore]] material and separating it into multiple [[Ore grade|grade]]s by [[particle size]].\n\nThis practice occurs in a variety of industries such as mining and [[mineral processing]], agriculture, pharmaceutical, food, plastics, and recycling.\n\n[A method of separating solid particles according to size alone is called screening]\n\n==General categories==\nScreening falls under two general categories: dry screening, and wet screening.  From these categories, screening separates a flow of material into grades, these grades are then either further processed to an intermediary product or a finished product. Additionally, the machines can be categorized into a moving screen and static screen machines, as well as by whether the screens are horizontal or inclined.\n\n==Applications==\nThe mining and mineral processing industry uses screening for a variety of processing applications.  For example, after mining the minerals, the material is transported to a primary crusher.  Before crushing large boulder are scalped on a shaker with {{convert|0.25|in|mm|abbr=on}} thick shielding screening.  Further down stream after crushing the material can pass through screens with openings or slots that continue to become smaller.  Finally, screening is used to make a final separation to produce saleable products based on a grade or a size range.\n\n==Process==\n[[File:Screener model of process.jpg|thumb|Model of Screening Process]]\nA screening machine consist of a drive that induces vibration, a screen media that causes particle separation, and a deck which holds the screen media and the drive and is the mode of transport for the vibration.\n\nThere are physical factors that makes screening practical.  For example, vibration, [[gravity|g force]], bed density, and material shape all facilitate the rate or cut.  [[Electrostatic force]]s can also hinder screening efficiency in way of water attraction causing sticking or plugging, or very dry material generate a charge that causes it to attract to the screen itself.\n\nAs with any industrial process there is a group of terms that identify and define what screening is.  Terms like blinding, contamination, frequency, amplitude, and others describe the basic characteristics of screening, and those characteristics in turn shape the overall method of dry or wet screening.\n\nIn addition, the way a deck is vibrated differentiates screens.  Different types of motion have their advantages and disadvantages.  In addition media types also have their different properties that lead to advantages and disadvantages.\n\nFinally, there are issues and problems associated with screening.  Screen tearing, contamination, blinding, and dampening all affect screening efficiency.\n\n==Physical principles==\n*[[Vibration]] - either [[sinusoidal]] vibration or [[gyratory]] vibration.\n**Sinusoidal Vibration occurs at an angled plane relative to the horizontal.  The vibration is in a wave pattern determined by frequency and amplitude.\n**Gyratory Vibration occurs at near level plane at low angles in a reciprocating side to side motion.\n*[[Gravity]] - This physical interaction is after material is thrown from the screen causing it to fall to a lower level.  Gravity also pulls the particles through the screen media.\n*[[Density]] - The density of the material relates to material stratification.\n*Electrostatic Force -  This force applies to screening when particles are extremely dry or is wet.\n\n==Screening terminology==\n\nLike any mechanical and physical entity there are scientific, industrial, and layman terminology.  The following is a partial list of terms that are associated with mechanical screening.\n*Amplitude - This is a measurement of the screen cloth as it vertically peaks to its tallest height and troughs to its lowest point.  Measured in multiples of the acceleration constant ''g'' ([[g-force]]).\n*Acceleration - Applied Acceleration to the screen mesh in order to overcome the van der waal forces\n*Blinding - When material plugs into the open slots of the screen cloth and inhibits overflowing material from falling through.<ref>[http://www.darbywiremesh.com/wire-mesh-glossary.html Woven Wire Mesh Glossary of Terms<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n*Brushing - This procedure is performed by an operator who uses a brush to brush over the screen cloth to dislodged blinded opening.\n*Contamination -  This is unwanted material in a given grade.  This occurs when there is oversize or fine size material relative to the cut or grade. Another type of contamination is foreign body contamination.\n**Oversize contamination occurs when there is a hole in the screen such that the hole is larger than the mesh size of the screen.  Other instances where oversize occurs is material overflow falling into the grade from overhead, or there is the wrong mesh size screen in place.\n**Fines contamination is when large sections of the screen cloth is blinded over, and material flowing over the screen does not fall through.  The fines are then retained in the grade.\n**Foreign body contamination is unwanted material that differs from the virgin material going over and through the screen.  It can be anything ranging from tree twigs, grass, metal slag to other mineral types and composition.  This contamination occurs when there is a hole in the scalping screen or a foreign material's mineralogy or chemical composition differs from the virgin material.\n*Deck - a deck is frame or apparatus that holds the screen cloth in place.  It also contains the screening drive.  It can contain multiple sections as the material travels from the feed end to the discharge end.  Multiple decks are screen decks placed in a configuration where there are a series of decks attached vertically and lean at the same angle as it preceding and exceeding decks.  Multiple decks are often referred to as single deck, double deck, triple deck, etc.\n*Frequency - Measured in [[hertz]] (Hz) or revolutions per minute (RPM).  Frequency is the number of times the screen cloth sinusoidally peaks and troughs within a second.  As for a gyratory screening motion it is the number of revolutions the screens or screen deck takes in a time interval, such as revolution per minute (RPM).\n*Gradation, grading - Also called \"cut\" or \"cutting.\"  Given a feed material in an initial state, the material can be defined to have a particle size distribution.  Grading is removing the maximum size material and minimum size material by way of mesh selection.<ref>[http://tpub.com/content/engine/14081/css/14081_454.htm Soil Gradation<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929091535/http://tpub.com/content/engine/14081/css/14081_454.htm |date=2007-09-29 }}</ref>\n*Screen Media (Screen cloth) - it is the material defined by mesh size, which can be made of any type of material such steel, stainless steel, rubber compounds, polyurethane, brass, etc.<ref>[http://www.pitandquarry.com/lesson-7-screening/ Pit & Quarry - Lesson 7 \u2013 Screening<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20140310145342/http://www.pitandquarry.com/lesson-7-screening/ |date=2014-03-10 }}</ref>\n*Shaker - the whole assembly of any type mechanical screening machine.\n*Stratification -  This phenomenon occurs as vibration is passed through a bed of material.  This causes coarse (larger) material to rise and finer (smaller) material to descend within the bed.  The material in contact with screen cloth either falls through a slot or blinds the slot or contacts the cloth material and is thrown from the cloth to fall to the next lower level.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.metsominerals.com/inetMinerals/mm_segments.nsf/WebWID/WTB-041223-2256F-10C45?OpenDocument |title=Screening<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2007-02-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070624081555/http://www.metsominerals.com/inetMinerals/mm_segments.nsf/WebWID/WTB-041223-2256F-10C45?OpenDocument |archive-date=2007-06-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n*Mesh -  The number of open slots per linear inch.  Mesh is arranged in multiple configuration.  Mesh can be a square pattern, long-slotted rectangular pattern, circular pattern, or diamond pattern.<ref>[http://www.wovenwire.com/reference/woven-wire-mesh-wire-cloth-glossary.htm The Complete Wire Mesh Glossary of Terms<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n*Scalp, scalping - this is the very first cut of the incoming material with the sum of all its grades.  Scalping is removing the largest size particles.  This includes enormously large particles relative to the other particle's sizes.  Scalping also cleans the incoming material from foreign body contamination such as twigs, trash, glass, or other unwanted oversize material.\n\n==Types of mechanical screening==\n\nThere are a number of types of mechanical screening equipment that cause segregation. These types are based on the motion of the machine through its motor drive.\n\n*Circle-throw vibrating equipment -  This type of equipment has an eccentric shaft that causes the frame of the shaker to lurch at a given angle.  This lurching action literally throws the material forward and up.  As the machine returns to its base state the material falls by gravity to physically lower level. This type of screening is used also in mining operations for large material with sizes that range from six inches to +20 mesh.<ref>[http://www.wstyler.on.ca/85.html WS Tyler \u00bb F-Class<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070919205532/http://www.wstyler.on.ca/85.html |date=2007-09-19 }}</ref>\n*High frequency vibrating equipment -  This type of equipment drives the screen cloth only.  Unlike above the frame of the equipment is fixed and only the screen vibrates.  However, this equipment is similar to the above such that it still throws material off of it and allows the particles to cascade down the screen cloth. These screens are for sizes smaller than 1/8 of an inch to +150 mesh.<ref>[http://www.rhewum.com RHEWUM WA- The original<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n*Gyratory equipment -  This type of equipment differs from the above two such that the machine gyrates in a circular motion at a near level plane at low angles.  The drive is an eccentric gear box or eccentric weights.<ref>[http://www.engelsmann.com Engelsmann Separators and Screeners<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>Sweco [http://www.sweco.com/separators_sifters_screeners.html - Vibratory Screener, Sifters <!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[https://www.russellfinex.com/en/separation-equipment Russell Finex Industrial Screening and Filtration equipment Manufacturer<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://elcanindustries.com/toll-manufacturing/toll-screening/|title=Toll Screening|website=Elcan Industries|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>  [[File:Chemical_Tumbler_Screener.png|thumb|Chemical Tumbler Screener]]\n*Trommel screens - Does not require vibrations, instead, material is fed into a horizontal rotating drum with screen panels around the diameter of the drum.\n\n===Tumbler screening technique===\n{{main|Tumbler screening technique}}\n\nAn improvement on vibration, vibratory, and linear screeners, a tumbler screener uses elliptical action which aids in screening of even very fine material. As like panning for gold, the fine particles tend to stay towards the center and the larger go to the outside. It allows for segregation and unloads the screen surface so that it can effectively do its job. With the addition of multiple decks and ball cleaning decks, even difficult products can be screened at high capacity to very fine separations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.almoprocess.com/content/tumbler-screeners |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821011917/http://almoprocess.com/content/tumbler-screeners |archivedate=2013-08-21 }}</ref>\n\n===Circle-throw vibrating equipment===\n{{main|Circle-Throw Vibrating Equipment}}\n\n[[Circle-Throw Vibrating Equipment]] is a shaker or a series of shakers as to where the drive causes the whole structure to move.  The structure extends to a maximum throw or length and then contracts to a base state.  A pattern of springs are situated below the structure to where there is vibration and shock absorption as the structure returns to the base state.\n\nThis type of equipment is used for very large particles, sizes that range from pebble size on up to boulder size material.  It is also designed for high volume output. As a scalper, this shaker will allow oversize material to pass over and fall into a crusher such a cone crusher, jaw crusher, or hammer mill.  The material that passes the screen by-passes the crusher and is conveyed and combined with the crush material.\n\nAlso this equipment is used in washing processes, as material passes under spray bars, finer material and foreign material is washed through the screen.  This is one example of wet screening.\n\n===High frequency vibrating equipment===\n{{main|High Frequency Vibrating Equipment}}\nHigh frequency vibrating equipment is a shaker whose frame is fixed and the drive vibrates only the screen cloth.  High frequency vibration equipment is for particles that are in this particle size range of an 1/8 in (3&nbsp;mm) down to a +150 mesh.\n\nThese shakers usually make a secondary cut for further processing or make a finished product cut.\n\nThese shakers are usually set at a steep angle relative to the horizontal level plane.  Angles range from 25 to 45 degrees relative to the horizontal level plane.\n[[File:Gyratory Screener.gif|thumb|Gyratory Screener]]\n\n===Gyratory equipment===\n{{main|Gyratory equipment}}\n\nThis type of equipment has an eccentric drive or weights that causes the shaker to travel in an orbital path.  The material rolls over the screen and falls with the induction of gravity and directional shifts.  Rubber balls and trays provide an additional mechanical means to cause the material to fall through.  The balls also provide a throwing action for the material to find an open slot to fall through.\n\nThe shaker is set a shallow angle relative to the horizontal level plane.  Usually, no more than 2 to 5 degrees relative to the horizontal level plane.\n\nThese types of shakers are used for very clean cuts.  Generally, a final material cut will not contain any oversize or any fines contamination.\n\nThese shakers are designed for the highest attainable quality at the cost of a reduced feed rate.\n\n===Trommel screens===\n{{main|Trommel screen}}\n\nTrommel screens have a rotating drum on a shallow angle with screen panels around the diameter of the drum. The feed material always sits at the bottom of the drum and, as the drum rotates, always comes into contact with clean screen. The oversize travels to the end of the drum as it does not pass through the screen, while the undersize passes through the screen into a launder below.\n\n==Screen Media Attachment Systems==\n\nThere are many ways to install screen media into a screen box deck (shaker deck). Also, the type of attachment system has an influence on the dimensions of the media.\n\n===Tensioned screen media===\nTensioned screen cloth is typically 4 feet by the width or the length of the screening machine depending on whether the deck is side or end tensioned.  Screen cloth for tensioned decks can be made with hooks and are attached with clamp rails bolted on both sides of the screen box.  When the clamp rail bolts are tightened, the cloth is tensioned or even stretched in the case of some types of self-cleaning screen media. To ensure that the center of the cloth does not tap repeatedly on the deck due to the vibrating shaker and that the cloth stays tensioned, support bars are positioned at different heights on the deck to create a crown curve from hook to hook on the cloth.<ref>[http://www.rocktoroad.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1932&Itemid=134 Crown curve<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313004650/http://www.rocktoroad.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1932&Itemid=134 |date=2014-03-13 }}</ref> Tensioned screen cloth is available in various materials: stainless steel, high carbon steel and oil tempered steel wires, as well as moulded rubber or polyurethane and hybrid screens (a self-cleaning screen cloth made of rubber or polyurethane and metal wires).\n\nCommonly, vibratory-type screening equipment employs rigid, circular sieve frames to which woven wire mesh is attached. Conventional methods of producing tensioned meshed screens has given way in recent years to bonding, whereby the mesh is no longer tensioned and trapped between a sieve frame body and clamping ring; instead, developments in modern adhesive technologies has allowed the industry to adopt high strength structural adhesives to bond tensioned mesh directly to frames.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Tensioned mesh sieves|url = http://www.robinsonwirecloth.co.uk/tensioned-mesh-sieves.html|website = Robinson Wire Cloth Ltd.|access-date = 2016-02-15}}</ref>\n\n===Modular screen media===\nModular screen media is typically 1 foot large by 1 or 2 feet long <ref>[http://www.schenckprocess.com/site/screenex/products/Polyurethane-Modular-Screening-Systems.html Panels Dimensions<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> (4 feet long for ISEPREN WS 85 <ref>[http://www.temaisenmann.com/%28S%28nztvbymhap5oxom5nrx0xv55%29A%28RTR6-qEDzgEkAAAANDk4OTk0MGItZGI4Zi00MWI5LThlNmEtZDM0ODcxZTI2NjdlINHvMedPqZ_pCwg2vcJqC7glRzw1%29%29/handbook/pdfs/WS-851.pdf ISEPREN WS 85  brochure<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{Dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>) steel reinforced polyurethane or rubber panels. They are installed on a flat deck (no crown) that normally has a larger surface than a tensioned deck. This larger surface design compensates for the fact that rubber and polyurethane modular screen media offers less open area than wire cloth.

Most often woven with a plain weave, or a twill weave for the lightest of meshes, apertures can be produced from a few microns upwards (e.g. 25 microns), employing wires with diameters from as little as 25 microns. A twill weave allows a mesh to be woven when the wire diameter is too thick in proportion to the aperture. Other, less commonplace, weaves, such as Dutch/Hollander, allow the production of meshes that are stronger and/or having smaller apertures.\n\nToday wire cloth is woven to strict international standards, e.g. ISO1944:1999,<ref>{{Cite web|title = ISO 9044:1999 - Industrial woven wire cloth -- Technical requirements and tests|url = http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=28424|website = www.iso.org|access-date = 2016-02-15}}</ref> which dictates acceptable tolerance regarding nominal mesh count and blemishes. The nominal mesh count, to which mesh is generally defined is a measure of the number of openings per lineal inch, determined by counting the number of openings from the centre of one wire to the centre of another wire one lineal inch away.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Glossary|url = http://www.robinsonwirecloth.co.uk/glossary.html|website = Robinson Wire Cloth Ltd.|access-date = 2016-02-15}}</ref> For example, a 2 mesh woven with a wire of 1.6mm wire diameter has an aperture of 11.1mm (see picture below of a 2 mesh with an intermediate crimp). The formula for calculating the aperture of a mesh, with a known mesh count and wire diameter, is as follows:\n\n<math>a = \\left ( \\frac{25.4}{b} \\right ) - c</math>\n\nwhere a = aperture, b = mesh count and c = wire diameter.\n\n[[File:Woven wire mesh.png|alt=Woven wire mesh|thumb|2 mesh with an intermediate crimp]]\nOther calculations regarding woven wire cloth/mesh can be made including weight and open area determination.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Woven wire mesh calculator|url = http://www.robinsonwirecloth.co.uk/calculator.html|website = Robinson Wire Cloth Ltd.|access-date = 2016-02-15}}</ref> Of note, wire diameters are often referred to by their [[standard wire gauge]] (swg); e.g. a 1.6mm wire is a 16 swg.\n\nTraditionally, screen cloth was made with metal wires woven with a loom.<ref>[https://www.haverboecker.com/en/the-company/about-us/our-history/ Haver & Boeker history<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313001927/https://www.haverboecker.com/en/the-company/about-us/our-history/ |date=2014-03-13 }}</ref><ref>[https://www.facebook.com/majorwire/photos/a.220200571325256.71666.133575833321064/226528134025833/?type=1&theater 19th century\u2019s product book page 1 from Major Wire<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[https://www.facebook.com/majorwire/photos/a.220200571325256.71666.133575833321064/226528227359157/?type=1&theater 19th century\u2019s product book page 2 from Major Wire<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Today, woven cloth is still widely used primarily because they are less expensive than other types of screen media. Over the years, different weaving techniques have been developed; either to increase the open area percentage or add wear-life.  Slotted opening woven cloth<ref>[http://www.okutanikanaami.co.jp/img/second/kanaami/toncap03-b.jpg Photo of a slotted opening woven wire cloth<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> is used where product shape is not a priority and where users need a higher open area percentage. Flat-top woven cloth<ref>[http://www.weavingideas.net/us/applications-products/industrial-wire-screens/screen-sections/weave-types-according-to-iso-47833.html Weave Types (see type E for Flat Top)<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313002335/http://www.weavingideas.net/us/applications-products/industrial-wire-screens/screen-sections/weave-types-according-to-iso-47833.html |date=2014-03-13 }}</ref> is used when the consumer wants to increase wear-life. On regular woven wire, the crimps (knuckles on woven wires) wear out faster than the rest of the cloth resulting in premature breakage. On flat-top woven wire, the cloth wears out equally until half of the wire diameter is worn, resulting in a longer wear life. Unfortunately flat-top woven wire cloth is not widely used because of the lack of crimps that causes a pronounced reduction of passing fines resulting in premature wear of con crushers.\n\n===Perforated & Punch Plate===\nOn a crushing and screening plant, punch plates or perforated plates<ref>[http://samscreen.com/product/replacement-punch-plate-screen/ Perforated Plate & Punch Plate<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> are mostly used on scalper vibrating screens, after raw products pass on grizzly bars.<ref>[http://aggregatesandminingtoday.com/improving-the-standard-grizzly-screen,2010-1,823,0,0,featured-story.aspx Grizzly Screen<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Most likely installed on a tensioned deck, punch plates offer excellent wear life for high-impact and high material flow applications.\n\n===Synthetic screen media (typically rubber or polyurethane)===\nSynthetic screen media is used where wear life is an issue. Large producers such as mines or huge quarries use them to reduce the frequency of having to stop the plant for screen deck maintenance. Rubber is also used as a very resistant high-impact screen media material used on the top deck of a scalper screen.<ref>[http://www.rockland.com/images/snap_graniterock_mar99.jpg Photo of a scalper screen with tensioned rubber panels<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140216225336/http://rockland.com/images/snap_graniterock_mar99.jpg |date=2014-02-16 }}</ref> To compete with rubber screen media fabrication, polyurethane manufacturers developed screen media with lower Shore Hardness. To compete with self-cleaning screen media that is still primarily available in tensioned cloth, synthetic screen media manufacturers also developed membrane screen panels, slotted opening panels and diamond opening panels. Due to the 7-degree demoulding angle, polyurethane screen media users can experience granulometry changes of product during the wear life of the panel.<ref>[http://www.hub-4.com/news/6262/flex-mat-3-modular-locking-system-options-significantly-increase-open-area-without-costly-screen-box-modifications \u201c7-degree demolding angle results in its openings widening as soon as the top surface is worn\u201d<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n===Self-Cleaning Screen Media===\nSelf-cleaning screen media was initially engineered to resolve screen cloth blinding, clogging and pegging problems. The idea was to place crimped wires side by side on a flat surface, creating openings and then, in some way, holding them together over the support bars (crown bars or bucker bars). This would allow the wires to be free to [[vibration|vibrate]] between the support bars, preventing blinding, clogging and pegging of the cloth. Initially, crimped longitudinal wires on self-cleaning cloth were held together over support bars with woven wire.<ref>[http://www.meister-siebe.de/en/screens/wire-cloths/harp-screen-type-b.html \u201cSelf-Cleaning\u201d woven wire cloth<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In the 50s, some manufacturers started to cover the woven cross wires with caulking or rubber to prevent premature wear of the crimps (knuckles on woven wires).  One of the pioneer products in this category was ONDAP GOMME made by the French manufacturer Giron.<ref>[http://www.giron.fr/english/screen-mesh/Anti-clogging.htm Giron\u2019s Anti-clogging products<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> During the mid 90s, Major Wire Industries Ltd., a Quebec manufacturer, developed a \u201chybrid\u201d self-cleaning screen cloth called Flex-Mat, without woven cross wires.<ref>[http://www.hub-4.com/news/s1/4112/flex-mat-vibrating-wire-technology-celebrates-15th-anniversary Flex-Mat 15th anniversary<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In this product, the crimped longitudinal wires are held in place by polyurethane strips. Instead of locking (impeding) the vibration over the support bars with woven cross wires, the polyurethane strips lessens the vibration of the longitudinal wires over the support bars but does not stop it, consequently allowing vibration from hook to hook.<ref>[http://www.agg-net.com/news/major-wire-make-it-a-double Hook to hook vibration<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Major Wire quickly started to promote this product as a high-performance screen that helped producers screen more in-specification material for less cost and not simply a problem solver.<ref>[http://www.aggman.com/flex-mat%C2%AE-3-increases-throughput-of-spec-product-while-solving-blinding-pegging-and-clogging-problems/ \"Flex-Mat\u00ae 3 Increases Throughput While Reducing Downtime\"<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> They claimed that the independent vibrating wires helped produce more product compared to a woven wire cloth with the same opening (aperture) and wire diameter. This higher throughput would be a direct result of the higher vibration [[frequency]] of each independent wire of the screen cloth (calculated in [[hertz]]) compared to the shaker vibration (calculated in [[Revolutions per minute|RPM]]), accelerating the stratification of the material bed. Another benefit that helped the throughput increase is that hybrid self-cleaning screen media offered a better open area percentage than woven wire screen media. Due to its flat surface (no knuckles), hybrid self-cleaning screen media can use a smaller wire diameter for the same aperture than woven wire and still lasts as long, resulting in a greater opening percentage.\n\n==References==\n{{Commons category|Screens (separators)|Screens}}\n\n{{reflist}}\n{{Extractive metallurgy}}\n\n[[Category:Mining equipment]]\n[[Category:Plastics industry]]\n[[Category:Metallurgical processes]]\n[[Category:Industrial processes]]\n[[Category:Solid-solid separation]]\n", "text_old": "'''Mechanical screening''', often just called '''screening''', is the practice of taking [[Granule (geology)|granulated]] [[ore]] material and separating it into multiple [[Ore grade|grade]]s by [[particle size]].\n\nThis practice occurs in a variety of industries such as mining and [[mineral processing]], agriculture, pharmaceutical, food, plastics, and recycling.\n\n[A method of separating solid particles according to size alone is called screening]\n\n==General categories==\nScreening falls under two general categories: dry screening, and wet screening.

Different types of motion have their advantages and disadvantages.  In addition media types also have their different properties that lead to advantages and disadvantages.\n\nFinally, there are issues and problems associated with screening.  Screen tearing, contamination, blinding, and dampening all affect screening efficiency.\n\n==Physical principles==\n*[[Vibration]] - either [[sinusoidal]] vibration or [[gyratory]] vibration.\n**Sinusoidal Vibration occurs at an angled plane relative to the horizontal.  The vibration is in a wave pattern determined by frequency and amplitude.\n**Gyratory Vibration occurs at near level plane at low angles in a reciprocating side to side motion.\n*[[Gravity]] - This physical interaction is after material is thrown from the screen causing it to fall to a lower level.  Gravity also pulls the particles through the screen media.\n*[[Density]] - The density of the material relates to material stratification.\n*Electrostatic Force -  This force applies to screening when particles are extremely dry or is wet.\n\n==Screening terminology==\n\nLike any mechanical and physical entity there are scientific, industrial, and layman terminology.  The following is a partial list of terms that are associated with mechanical screening.\n*Amplitude - This is a measurement of the screen cloth as it vertically peaks to its tallest height and troughs to its lowest point.  Measured in multiples of the acceleration constant ''g'' ([[g-force]]).\n*Acceleration - Applied Acceleration to the screen mesh in order to overcome the van der waal forces\n*Blinding - When material plugs into the open slots of the screen cloth and inhibits overflowing material from falling through.<ref>[http://www.darbywiremesh.com/wire-mesh-glossary.html Woven Wire Mesh Glossary of Terms<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n*Brushing - This procedure is performed by an operator who uses a brush to brush over the screen cloth to dislodged blinded opening.\n*Contamination -  This is unwanted material in a given grade.  This occurs when there is oversize or fine size material relative to the cut or grade. Another type of contamination is foreign body contamination.\n**Oversize contamination occurs when there is a hole in the screen such that the hole is larger than the mesh size of the screen.  Other instances where oversize occurs is material overflow falling into the grade from overhead, or there is the wrong mesh size screen in place.\n**Fines contamination is when large sections of the screen cloth is blinded over, and material flowing over the screen does not fall through.  The fines are then retained in the grade.\n**Foreign body contamination is unwanted material that differs from the virgin material going over and through the screen.  It can be anything ranging from tree twigs, grass, metal slag to other mineral types and composition.  This contamination occurs when there is a hole in the scalping screen or a foreign material's mineralogy or chemical composition differs from the virgin material.\n*Deck - a deck is frame or apparatus that holds the screen cloth in place.  It also contains the screening drive.  It can contain multiple sections as the material travels from the feed end to the discharge end.  Multiple decks are screen decks placed in a configuration where there are a series of decks attached vertically and lean at the same angle as it preceding and exceeding decks.  Multiple decks are often referred to as single deck, double deck, triple deck, etc.\n*Frequency - Measured in [[hertz]] (Hz) or revolutions per minute (RPM).  Frequency is the number of times the screen cloth sinusoidally peaks and troughs within a second.  As for a gyratory screening motion it is the number of revolutions the screens or screen deck takes in a time interval, such as revolution per minute (RPM).\n*Gradation, grading - Also called \"cut\" or \"cutting.\"  Given a feed material in an initial state, the material can be defined to have a particle size distribution.  Grading is removing the maximum size material and minimum size material by way of mesh selection.<ref>[http://tpub.com/content/engine/14081/css/14081_454.htm Soil Gradation<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929091535/http://tpub.com/content/engine/14081/css/14081_454.htm |date=2007-09-29 }}</ref>\n*Screen Media (Screen cloth) - it is the material defined by mesh size, which can be made of any type of material such steel, stainless steel, rubber compounds, polyurethane, brass, etc.<ref>[http://www.pitandquarry.com/lesson-7-screening/ Pit & Quarry - Lesson 7 \u2013 Screening<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20140310145342/http://www.pitandquarry.com/lesson-7-screening/ |date=2014-03-10 }}</ref>\n*Shaker - the whole assembly of any type mechanical screening machine.\n*Stratification -  This phenomenon occurs as vibration is passed through a bed of material.  This causes coarse (larger) material to rise and finer (smaller) material to descend within the bed.  The material in contact with screen cloth either falls through a slot or blinds the slot or contacts the cloth material and is thrown from the cloth to fall to the next lower level.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.metsominerals.com/inetMinerals/mm_segments.nsf/WebWID/WTB-041223-2256F-10C45?OpenDocument |title=Screening<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2007-02-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070624081555/http://www.metsominerals.com/inetMinerals/mm_segments.nsf/WebWID/WTB-041223-2256F-10C45?OpenDocument |archive-date=2007-06-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n*Mesh -  The number of open slots per linear inch.  Mesh is arranged in multiple configuration.  Mesh can be a square pattern, long-slotted rectangular pattern, circular pattern, or diamond pattern.<ref>[http://www.wovenwire.com/reference/woven-wire-mesh-wire-cloth-glossary.htm The Complete Wire Mesh Glossary of Terms<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n*Scalp, scalping - this is the very first cut of the incoming material with the sum of all its grades.  Scalping is removing the largest size particles.  This includes enormously large particles relative to the other particle's sizes.  Scalping also cleans the incoming material from foreign body contamination such as twigs, trash, glass, or other unwanted oversize material.\n\n==Types of mechanical screening==\n\nThere are a number of types of mechanical screening equipment that cause segregation. These types are based on the motion of the machine through its motor drive.\n\n*Circle-throw vibrating equipment -  This type of equipment has an eccentric shaft that causes the frame of the shaker to lurch at a given angle.  This lurching action literally throws the material forward and up.  As the machine returns to its base state the material falls by gravity to physically lower level. This type of screening is used also in mining operations for large material with sizes that range from six inches to +20 mesh.<ref>[http://www.wstyler.on.ca/85.html WS Tyler \u00bb F-Class<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070919205532/http://www.wstyler.on.ca/85.html |date=2007-09-19 }}</ref>\n*High frequency vibrating equipment -  This type of equipment drives the screen cloth only.  Unlike above the frame of the equipment is fixed and only the screen vibrates.  However, this equipment is similar to the above such that it still throws material off of it and allows the particles to cascade down the screen cloth. These screens are for sizes smaller than 1/8 of an inch to +150 mesh.<ref>[http://www.rhewum.com RHEWUM WA- The original<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n*Gyratory equipment -  This type of equipment differs from the above two such that the machine gyrates in a circular motion at a near level plane at low angles.  The drive is an eccentric gear box or eccentric weights.<ref>[http://www.engelsmann.com Engelsmann Separators and Screeners<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[https://elcanindustries.com/toll-manufacturing/toll-screening/ Elcan Industries - Vibratory Screener, Sifters, Hi Sifter, High Energy Screener<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[https://www.russellfinex.com/en/separation-equipment Russell Finex Industrial Screening and Filtration equipment Manufacturer<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  [[File:Chemical_Tumbler_Screener.png|thumb|Chemical Tumbler Screener]]\n*Trommel screens - Does not require vibrations, instead, material is fed into a horizontal rotating drum with screen panels around the diameter of the drum.\n\n===Tumbler screening technique===\n{{main|Tumbler screening technique}}\n\nAn improvement on vibration, vibratory, and linear screeners, a tumbler screener uses elliptical action which aids in screening of even very fine material. As like panning for gold, the fine particles tend to stay towards the center and the larger go to the outside. It allows for segregation and unloads the screen surface so that it can effectively do its job. With the addition of multiple decks and ball cleaning decks, even difficult products can be screened at high capacity to very fine separations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.almoprocess.com/content/tumbler-screeners |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821011917/http://almoprocess.com/content/tumbler-screeners |archivedate=2013-08-21 }}</ref>\n\n===Circle-throw vibrating equipment===\n{{main|Circle-Throw Vibrating Equipment}}\n\n[[Circle-Throw Vibrating Equipment]] is a shaker or a series of shakers as to where the drive causes the whole structure to move.  The structure extends to a maximum throw or length and then contracts to a base state.  A pattern of springs are situated below the structure to where there is vibration and shock absorption as the structure returns to the base state.\n\nThis type of equipment is used for very large particles, sizes that range from pebble size on up to boulder size material.  It is also designed for high volume output. As a scalper, this shaker will allow oversize material to pass over and fall into a crusher such a cone crusher, jaw crusher, or hammer mill.  The material that passes the screen by-passes the crusher and is conveyed and combined with the crush material.\n\nAlso this equipment is used in washing processes, as material passes under spray bars, finer material and foreign material is washed through the screen.  This is one example of wet screening.\n\n===High frequency vibrating equipment===\n{{main|High Frequency Vibrating Equipment}}\nHigh frequency vibrating equipment is a shaker whose frame is fixed and the drive vibrates only the screen cloth.  High frequency vibration equipment is for particles that are in this particle size range of an 1/8 in (3&nbsp;mm) down to a +150 mesh.\n\nThese shakers usually make a secondary cut for further processing or make a finished product cut.\n\nThese shakers are usually set at a steep angle relative to the horizontal level plane.  Angles range from 25 to 45 degrees relative to the horizontal level plane.\n[[File:Gyratory Screener.gif|thumb|Gyratory Screener]]\n\n===Gyratory equipment===\n{{main|Gyratory equipment}}\n\nThis type of equipment has an eccentric drive or weights that causes the shaker to travel in an orbital path.  The material rolls over the screen and falls with the induction of gravity and directional shifts.  Rubber balls and trays provide an additional mechanical means to cause the material to fall through.  The balls also provide a throwing action for the material to find an open slot to fall through.\n\nThe shaker is set a shallow angle relative to the horizontal level plane.  Usually, no more than 2 to 5 degrees relative to the horizontal level plane.\n\nThese types of shakers are used for very clean cuts.  Generally, a final material cut will not contain any oversize or any fines contamination.\n\nThese shakers are designed for the highest attainable quality at the cost of a reduced feed rate.\n\n===Trommel screens===\n{{main|Trommel screen}}\n\nTrommel screens have a rotating drum on a shallow angle with screen panels around the diameter of the drum. The feed material always sits at the bottom of the drum and, as the drum rotates, always comes into contact with clean screen. The oversize travels to the end of the drum as it does not pass through the screen, while the undersize passes through the screen into a launder below.\n\n==Screen Media Attachment Systems==\n\nThere are many ways to install screen media into a screen box deck (shaker deck). Also, the type of attachment system has an influence on the dimensions of the media.\n\n===Tensioned screen media===\nTensioned screen cloth is typically 4 feet by the width or the length of the screening machine depending on whether the deck is side or end tensioned.  Screen cloth for tensioned decks can be made with hooks and are attached with clamp rails bolted on both sides of the screen box.  When the clamp rail bolts are tightened, the cloth is tensioned or even stretched in the case of some types of self-cleaning screen media. To ensure that the center of the cloth does not tap repeatedly on the deck due to the vibrating shaker and that the cloth stays tensioned, support bars are positioned at different heights on the deck to create a crown curve from hook to hook on the cloth.<ref>[http://www.rocktoroad.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1932&Itemid=134 Crown curve<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313004650/http://www.rocktoroad.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1932&Itemid=134 |date=2014-03-13 }}</ref> Tensioned screen cloth is available in various materials: stainless steel, high carbon steel and oil tempered steel wires, as well as moulded rubber or polyurethane and hybrid screens (a self-cleaning screen cloth made of rubber or polyurethane and metal wires).\n\nCommonly, vibratory-type screening equipment employs rigid, circular sieve frames to which woven wire mesh is attached. Conventional methods of producing tensioned meshed screens has given way in recent years to bonding, whereby the mesh is no longer tensioned and trapped between a sieve frame body and clamping ring; instead, developments in modern adhesive technologies has allowed the industry to adopt high strength structural adhesives to bond tensioned mesh directly to frames.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Tensioned mesh sieves|url = http://www.robinsonwirecloth.co.uk/tensioned-mesh-sieves.html|website = Robinson Wire Cloth Ltd.|access-date = 2016-02-15}}</ref>\n\n===Modular screen media===\nModular screen media is typically 1 foot large by 1 or 2 feet long <ref>[http://www.schenckprocess.com/site/screenex/products/Polyurethane-Modular-Screening-Systems.html Panels Dimensions<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> (4 feet long for ISEPREN WS 85 <ref>[http://www.temaisenmann.com/%28S%28nztvbymhap5oxom5nrx0xv55%29A%28RTR6-qEDzgEkAAAANDk4OTk0MGItZGI4Zi00MWI5LThlNmEtZDM0ODcxZTI2NjdlINHvMedPqZ_pCwg2vcJqC7glRzw1%29%29/handbook/pdfs/WS-851.pdf ISEPREN WS 85  brochure<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{Dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>) steel reinforced polyurethane or rubber panels. They are installed on a flat deck (no crown) that normally has a larger surface than a tensioned deck. This larger surface design compensates for the fact that rubber and polyurethane modular screen media offers less open area than wire cloth. Over the years, numerous ways have been developed to attach modular panels to the screen deck stringers (girders).<ref>[http://www.tandemproducts.com/tandem/product_info.php?products_id=136&XTCsid=pxzopbfobcdlscel Modular panels types<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313002019/http://www.tandemproducts.com/tandem/product_info.php?products_id=136&XTCsid=pxzopbfobcdlscel |date=2014-03-13 }}</ref> Some of these attachment systems have been or are currently patented.<ref>[https://www.google.com/search?tbm=pts&hl=fr&q=Screen+and+screen+element#hl=fr&q=vibrating+screen+panel&tbm=pts Google Patent - vibrating screen panel<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Self-cleaning screen media is also available on this modular system.<ref>[http://majorwire.cc/en/products/flex-mat-3-modular Flex-Mat 3 Modular<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n=== Tensionless screen media ===\n<br />\n==Types of Screen Media==\nThere are several types of screen media manufactured with different types of material that use the two common types of screen media attachment systems, tensioned and modular.\n\n===Woven Wire Cloth ([[Mesh]])===\nWoven wire cloth, typically produced from stainless steel, is commonly employed as a filtration medium for sieving in a wide range of industries. Most often woven with a plain weave, or a twill weave for the lightest of meshes, apertures can be produced from a few microns upwards (e.g. 25 microns), employing wires with diameters from as little as 25 microns. A twill weave allows a mesh to be woven when the wire diameter is too thick in proportion to the aperture. Other, less commonplace, weaves, such as Dutch/Hollander, allow the production of meshes that are stronger and/or having smaller apertures.\n\nToday wire cloth is woven to strict international standards, e.g. ISO1944:1999,<ref>{{Cite web|title = ISO 9044:1999 - Industrial woven wire cloth -- Technical requirements and tests|url = http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=28424|website = www.iso.org|access-date = 2016-02-15}}</ref> which dictates acceptable tolerance regarding nominal mesh count and blemishes. The nominal mesh count, to which mesh is generally defined is a measure of the number of openings per lineal inch, determined by counting the number of openings from the centre of one wire to the centre of another wire one lineal inch away.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Glossary|url = http://www.robinsonwirecloth.co.uk/glossary.html|website = Robinson Wire Cloth Ltd.|access-date = 2016-02-15}}</ref> For example, a 2 mesh woven with a wire of 1.6mm wire diameter has an aperture of 11.1mm (see picture below of a 2 mesh with an intermediate crimp). The formula for calculating the aperture of a mesh, with a known mesh count and wire diameter, is as follows:\n\n<math>a = \\left ( \\frac{25.4}{b} \\right ) - c</math>\n\nwhere a = aperture, b = mesh count and c = wire diameter.\n\n[[File:Woven wire mesh.png|alt=Woven wire mesh|thumb|2 mesh with an intermediate crimp]]\nOther calculations regarding woven wire cloth/mesh can be made including weight and open area determination.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Woven wire mesh calculator|url = http://www.robinsonwirecloth.co.uk/calculator.html|website = Robinson Wire Cloth Ltd.|access-date = 2016-02-15}}</ref> Of note, wire diameters are often referred to by their [[standard wire gauge]] (swg); e.g. a 1.6mm wire is a 16 swg.\n\nTraditionally, screen cloth was made with metal wires woven with a loom.<ref>[https://www.haverboecker.com/en/the-company/about-us/our-history/ Haver & Boeker history<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313001927/https://www.haverboecker.com/en/the-company/about-us/our-history/ |date=2014-03-13 }}</ref><ref>[https://www.facebook.com/majorwire/photos/a.220200571325256.71666.133575833321064/226528134025833/?type=1&theater 19th century\u2019s product book page 1 from Major Wire<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[https://www.facebook.com/majorwire/photos/a.220200571325256.71666.133575833321064/226528227359157/?type=1&theater 19th century\u2019s product book page 2 from Major Wire<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Today, woven cloth is still widely used primarily because they are less expensive than other types of screen media. Over the years, different weaving techniques have been developed; either to increase the open area percentage or add wear-life.  Slotted opening woven cloth<ref>[http://www.okutanikanaami.co.jp/img/second/kanaami/toncap03-b.jpg Photo of a slotted opening woven wire cloth<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> is used where product shape is not a priority and where users need a higher open area percentage. Flat-top woven cloth<ref>[http://www.weavingideas.net/us/applications-products/industrial-wire-screens/screen-sections/weave-types-according-to-iso-47833.html Weave Types (see type E for Flat Top)<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313002335/http://www.weavingideas.net/us/applications-products/industrial-wire-screens/screen-sections/weave-types-according-to-iso-47833.html |date=2014-03-13 }}</ref> is used when the consumer wants to increase wear-life. On regular woven wire, the crimps (knuckles on woven wires) wear out faster than the rest of the cloth resulting in premature breakage. On flat-top woven wire, the cloth wears out equally until half of the wire diameter is worn, resulting in a longer wear life. Unfortunately flat-top woven wire cloth is not widely used because of the lack of crimps that causes a pronounced reduction of passing fines resulting in premature wear of con crushers.\n\n===Perforated & Punch Plate===\nOn a crushing and screening plant, punch plates or perforated plates<ref>[http://samscreen.com/product/replacement-punch-plate-screen/ Perforated Plate & Punch Plate<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> are mostly used on scalper vibrating screens, after raw products pass on grizzly bars.<ref>[http://aggregatesandminingtoday.com/improving-the-standard-grizzly-screen,2010-1,823,0,0,featured-story.aspx Grizzly Screen<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Most likely installed on a tensioned deck, punch plates offer excellent wear life for high-impact and high material flow applications.\n\n===Synthetic screen media (typically rubber or polyurethane)===\nSynthetic screen media is used where wear life is an issue. Large producers such as mines or huge quarries use them to reduce the frequency of having to stop the plant for screen deck maintenance. Rubber is also used as a very resistant high-impact screen media material used on the top deck of a scalper screen.<ref>[http://www.rockland.com/images/snap_graniterock_mar99.jpg Photo of a scalper screen with tensioned rubber panels<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140216225336/http://rockland.com/images/snap_graniterock_mar99.jpg |date=2014-02-16 }}</ref> To compete with rubber screen media fabrication, polyurethane manufacturers developed screen media with lower Shore Hardness. To compete with self-cleaning screen media that is still primarily available in tensioned cloth, synthetic screen media manufacturers also developed membrane screen panels, slotted opening panels and diamond opening panels. Due to the 7-degree demoulding angle, polyurethane screen media users can experience granulometry changes of product during the wear life of the panel.<ref>[http://www.hub-4.com/news/6262/flex-mat-3-modular-locking-system-options-significantly-increase-open-area-without-costly-screen-box-modifications \u201c7-degree demolding angle results in its openings widening as soon as the top surface is worn\u201d<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n===Self-Cleaning Screen Media===\nSelf-cleaning screen media was initially engineered to resolve screen cloth blinding, clogging and pegging problems. The idea was to place crimped wires side by side on a flat surface, creating openings and then, in some way, holding them together over the support bars (crown bars or bucker bars). This would allow the wires to be free to [[vibration|vibrate]] between the support bars, preventing blinding, clogging and pegging of the cloth. Initially, crimped longitudinal wires on self-cleaning cloth were held together over support bars with woven wire.<ref>[http://www.meister-siebe.de/en/screens/wire-cloths/harp-screen-type-b.html \u201cSelf-Cleaning\u201d woven wire cloth<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In the 50s, some manufacturers started to cover the woven cross wires with caulking or rubber to prevent premature wear of the crimps (knuckles on woven wires).  One of the pioneer products in this category was ONDAP GOMME made by the French manufacturer Giron.<ref>[http://www.giron.fr/english/screen-mesh/Anti-clogging.htm Giron\u2019s Anti-clogging products<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> During the mid 90s, Major Wire Industries Ltd., a Quebec manufacturer, developed a \u201chybrid\u201d self-cleaning screen cloth called Flex-Mat, without woven cross wires.<ref>[http://www.hub-4.com/news/s1/4112/flex-mat-vibrating-wire-technology-celebrates-15th-anniversary Flex-Mat 15th anniversary<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In this product, the crimped longitudinal wires are held in place by polyurethane strips. Instead of locking (impeding) the vibration over the support bars with woven cross wires, the polyurethane strips lessens the vibration of the longitudinal wires over the support bars but does not stop it, consequently allowing vibration from hook to hook.<ref>[http://www.agg-net.com/news/major-wire-make-it-a-double Hook to hook vibration<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Major Wire quickly started to promote this product as a high-performance screen that helped producers screen more in-specification material for less cost and not simply a problem solver.<ref>[http://www.aggman.com/flex-mat%C2%AE-3-increases-throughput-of-spec-product-while-solving-blinding-pegging-and-clogging-problems/ \"Flex-Mat\u00ae 3 Increases Throughput While Reducing Downtime\"<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> They claimed that the independent vibrating wires helped produce more product compared to a woven wire cloth with the same opening (aperture) and wire diameter. This higher throughput would be a direct result of the higher vibration [[frequency]] of each independent wire of the screen cloth (calculated in [[hertz]]) compared to the shaker vibration (calculated in [[Revolutions per minute|RPM]]), accelerating the stratification of the material bed. Another benefit that helped the throughput increase is that hybrid self-cleaning screen media offered a better open area percentage than woven wire screen media. Due to its flat surface (no knuckles), hybrid self-cleaning screen media can use a smaller wire diameter for the same aperture than woven wire and still lasts as long, resulting in a greater opening percentage.\n\n==References==\n{{Commons category|Screens (separators)|Screens}}\n\n{{reflist}}\n{{Extractive metallurgy}}\n\n[[Category:Mining equipment]]\n[[Category:Plastics industry]]\n[[Category:Metallurgical processes]]\n[[Category:Industrial processes]]\n[[Category:Solid-solid separation]]\n", "name_user": "Raf1986", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReferences", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_screening"}

It also marked the later years of [[scholasticism]]\n\n==Eastern Orthodoxy==\n\n[[File:Tpose Garfield.jpg|thumb|Yes]]\n[[File:Tpose Garfield.jpg|thumb]]\n===Reunion attempts===\nThe eastern Emperor [[John VIII Palaeologus]], pressed hard by the [[Ottoman Turks]], was keen to ally himself with the West, and to do so he arranged with [[Pope Eugene IV]] for discussions about reunion to be held again, this time at the [[Council of Ferrara-Florence]]. After several long discussions, the emperor managed to convince the Eastern representatives to accept the Western doctrines of Filioque, Purgatory and the supremacy of the Papacy. On 6 June 1439, an agreement was signed by all the Eastern bishops present but one, [[Mark of Ephesus]], who held that Rome continued in both [[heresy]] and [[Schism (religion)|schism]]. It seemed that the Great Schism had been ended. However, upon their return, the Eastern bishops found their agreement with the West broadly rejected by the populace and by civil authorities (with the notable exception of the emperors of the East who remained committed to union until the [[Fall of Constantinople]] two decades later). The union signed at Florence has never been accepted by the Eastern churches.\n\n=== Fall of Constantinople ===\n[[File:Theofilos Palaiologos.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Painting by the Greek folk painter [[Theophilos Hatzimihail]] showing the battle inside the city, Constantine is visible on a white horse]]\nIn 1453, the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] fell to the [[Ottoman Empire]]. But Orthodoxy was still very strong in [[Russia]] which became autocephalous (since 1448, although this was not officially accepted by Constantinople until 1589); and thus [[Moscow]] called itself the [[Third Rome]], as the cultural heir of [[Constantinople]].\n\nEastern Christians expressed a belief that the fall of Constantinople was God's punishment for the emperor and clergy accepting the West's doctrines of [[filioque]], [[purgatory]] and the supremacy of the [[papacy]]. The West did not fulfill its promise to the Eastern emperor of troops and support if he agreed to the reconciliation. The [[Sack of Constantinople]] is still considered proof by the East that the West ultimately succeeded in its endeavor to destroy the East.\n\nUnder Ottoman rule, the Orthodox Church acquired power as an autonomous millet. The ecumenical patriarch was the religious and administrative ruler of the entire [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)#Orthodox Christians|Rum Millet]] (Ottoman administrative unit), which encompassed all the Eastern Orthodox subjects of the empire. Those appointed to the role were chosen by the Muslims rulers not the Church.\n\nAs a result of the Ottoman conquest, the entire Orthodox communion of the Balkans and the Near East became suddenly isolated from the West. For the next four hundred years, it was confined within the Islamic world, with which it had little in common religiously or culturally. The Orthodox Churches from [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] states, [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]] were the only part of the Orthodox communion that remained outside the control of the Ottoman Empire.\n\n[[File:Stavronikita Aug2006.jpg|thumb|330px|right|Stavronikita monastery, South-East view]]\n\n===Isolation from the West===\nAs a result of the Ottoman conquest of the Byzantine Empire in 1453, and the [[Fall of Constantinople]], the entire Orthodox communion of the Balkans and the Near East became suddenly isolated from the West. For the next four hundred years, it was confined within a hostile Islamic world, with which it had little in common religiously or culturally. The [[Russian Orthodox Church]] was the only part of the Orthodox communion which remained outside the control of the Ottoman Empire. It is, in part, due to this geographical and intellectual confinement that the voice of Eastern Orthodoxy was not heard during the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in 16th-century Europe. As a result, this important theological debate often seems strange and distorted to the Orthodox. They never took part in it and thus neither Reformation nor [[Counter-Reformation]] is part of their theological framework.\n\n===Religious rights under the Ottoman Empire===\n{{Further|Islam and anti-Christian persecution}}\n[[Islam]] recognized [[Jesus]] as a great prophet and considered Christians as another [[People of the Book]]. But it imposed severe penalties including frequent deaths for non Muslims. As such, the Church was not extinguished nor was its canonical and hierarchical organization completely destroyed. Its administration continued to function though in lesser degree, no longer being the state religion. One of the first things that [[Mehmed II|Mehmet the Conqueror]] did was to allow the Church to elect a new patriarch, [[Gennadius Scholarius]]. The [[Hagia Sophia]] and the [[Parthenon]], which had been Christian churches for nearly a millennium, were converted into mosques, yet most other churches, both in Constantinople and elsewhere, remained in Christian hands. Because [[Sharia|Islamic law]] makes no distinction between nationality and religion, all Christians, regardless of their language or nationality, were considered a single [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet]], or nation. The patriarch, as the highest ranking hierarch, was thus invested with civil and religious authority and made [[ethnarch]], head of the entire Christian Orthodox population. Practically, this meant that all Orthodox Churches within Ottoman territory were under the control of Constantinople. Thus, the authority and jurisdictional frontiers of the patriarch were enormously enlarged.\n\nHowever, these [[Dhimmitude|rights and privileges]], including freedom of worship and religious organisation, were often established in principle but seldom corresponded to reality. The legal privileges of the patriarch and the Church depended, in fact, on the whim and mercy of the [[Sultan]] and the [[Sublime Porte]], while all Christians were viewed as second-class citizens. Moreover, Turkish corruption and brutality were not a myth. That it was the \"infidel\" Christian who experienced this more than anyone else is not in doubt. Nor were pogroms of Christians in these centuries unknown (see [[Greco-Turkish relations]]).<ref name=AIHG-NYT>[http://www.aihgs.com/New%20York%20Times.htm The Australian Institute for Holocaust and Genocide Studies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607184704/http://www.aihgs.com/New%20York%20Times.htm |date=2007-06-07 }} ''The New York Times''.</ref><ref>http://www.helleniccomserve.com/pdf/BlkBkPontusPrinceton.pdf</ref> Devastating, too, for the Church was the fact that it could not bear witness to Christ. Missionary work among Muslims was dangerous and indeed impossible, whereas conversion to Islam was entirely legal and permissible. Converts to Islam who returned to Orthodoxy were put to death as apostates. No new churches could be built, and even the ringing of church bells was prohibited. Education of the clergy and the Christian population either ceased altogether or was reduced to the most rudimentary elements.\n\n===Corruption===\nThe Orthodox Church found itself subject to the Turkish system of corruption. The patriarchal throne was frequently sold to the highest bidder, while new patriarchal investiture was accompanied by heavy payment to the government. In order to recoup their losses, patriarchs and bishops taxed the local parishes and their clergy. The patriarchal throne was never secure. Few patriarchs between the 15th and the 19th centuries died a natural death while in office. The forced abdications, exiles, hangings, drownings, and poisonings of patriarchs are well documented. But if the patriarch's position was precarious so was the hierarchy's.\n\n===Devshirmeh===\n[[Devshirmeh]] was the system of the collection of young boys from conquered Christian lands by the Ottoman sultans as a form of regular taxation in order to build a loyal  army (formerly largely composed of war captives) and the class of (military) administrators called the \"[[Janissary|Janissaries]]\", or other servants such as tellak in hamams. The word ''dev\u015firme'' means \"collecting, gathering\" in [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]]. Boys delivered to the Ottomans in this way were called ''[[ghilm\u00e1n]]'' or ''acemi oglanlar'' (\"novice boys\").\n\n===Antioch===\nThe Church of Antioch was moved to [[Damascus]] in response to the Ottoman invasion of Antioch. Its traditional territory includes Syria, Lebanon, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait and parts of Turkey. The remainder of the Church of Antioch, primarily local Greeks or Hellenized sections of the indigenous population, remained in communion with Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, and Jerusalem\n\n==Western Christianity==\n\n===Western Schism ===\n{{Main|Western Schism}}\n\nIn 1409, a council was convened at [[Pisa]] to resolve the issue. The council declared both existing popes to be schismatic ([[Gregory XII]] from Rome; [[Antipope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]] from Avignon) and appointed a new one, [[Antipope Alexander V|Alexander V]]. But the existing popes refused to resign, and thus there were three papal claimants. Another council was convened in 1414, the [[Council of Constance]]. In March 1415 the Pisan pope, [[John XXIII]], fled from Constance in disguise; he was brought back a prisoner and deposed in May. The Roman pope, Gregory XII, resigned voluntarily in July. The Avignon pope, Benedict XIII, refused to come to Constance; nor would he consider resignation. The council finally deposed him in July 1417. The council in Constance, having finally cleared the field of popes and antipopes, elected [[Pope Martin V]] as pope in November.\n\n=== Italian Renaissance (1399\u20131599) ===\n[[File:Michelangelo's Pieta 5450 cropncleaned.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Michelangelo's ''Piet\u00e0'' in St. Peter's Basilica, Vatican City]]\nThe [[Italian Renaissance]] was a period of great cultural change and achievement, marked in Italy by a classical orientation and an increase of wealth through mercantile trade. The city of Rome, the Papacy, and the Papal States were all affected by the Renaissance. On the one hand, it was a time of great artistic patronage and architectural magnificence, where the Church supported such artists as [[Michelangelo]], [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]], [[Donato Bramante|Bramante]], [[Raphael]], [[Fra Angelico]], [[Donatello]], and [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. On the other hand, wealthy Italian families often secured episcopal offices, including the papacy, for their own members, some of whom were known for immorality, such as [[Pope Alexander VI|Alexander VI]] and [[Pope Sixtus IV|Sixtus IV]].\n\n===Scholasticism===\nScholastic theology continued to develop as the 13th century gave way to the fourteenth, becoming ever more complex and subtle in its distinctions and arguments.  The 14th century saw in particular the rise to dominance of the [[nominalism|nominalist]] or [[voluntarism (metaphysics)|voluntarist]] theologies of men like [[William of Ockham]].  The 14th century was also a time in which movements of widely varying character worked for the reform of the institutional church, such as [[conciliarism]], [[Lollardy]] and the [[Hussite]]s.  Spiritual movements such as the [[Devotio Moderna]] also flourished.\n\nNotable authors include:\n[[File:Hus na kazatelne.jpg|thumb|right|160pf|Jan Hus preaching, illumination from a Czech manuscript, 1490s]]\n* [[Jan Hus]] (c.1369\u20131415)\n* [[Pierre d'Ailly]] (1351\u20131420)\n* [[Jean Gerson]] (1363\u20131429)\n* [[Nicholas of Clemanges]] (1360\u20131440)\n* [[Nicholas of Cusa]] (1401\u20131464)\n* [[Thomas a Kempis]] (1380\u20131471)\n* [[Denis the Carthusian]] (1402\u20131471)\n* [[Rudolf Agricola]] (1444\u20131485)\n* [[Wessel Gansfort]] (1419\u20131489)\n* [[Gabriel Biel]] (1425\u20131495)\n* [[Johann Heynlin]] (1425\u20131496) \n* [[Girolamo Savonarola]] (1452\u20131498)\n* [[Jan Standonck]] (1454\u20131504)\n* [[Conrad Celtis]] (1459\u20131508)\n* [[Johann Geiler]] (1445\u20131510)\n* [[John Colet]] (1467\u20131519)\n* [[Johann Reuchlin]] (1455\u20131522)\n* [[Ulrich von Hutten]] (1488\u20131523)\n* [[Johann von Staupitz]] (1460\u20131524)\n* [[Jacob Wimpfeling]] (1450\u20131528)\n* [[Jacques Lefevre d'Etaples]] (1455\u20131536)\n* [[Desiderius Erasmus]] (1466\u20131536)\n\n===Protestant Reformation roots and precursors===\n{{see also|Bohemian Reformation}}\n[[Image: Jagie\u0142\u0142o dispute.JPG|right|thumb|Hussite theologians dispute in the presence of King [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o]] of Poland]]\nThe Council of Constance confirmed strengthened the traditional medieval conception of Churches and Empires. It did not address the national tensions or the theological tensions which had been stirred up during the previous century. The council could not prevent [[Schism (religion)|schisms]] and the [[Hussite Wars]] in [[Bohemia]].<ref>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Hussites |volume=14 |pages=7\u20139 |first=Franti\u0161ek |last=L\u00fctzow }}</ref>\n\nHistorical upheaval usually yields much new thinking as to how society should be organized. This was the case leading up to the Protestant Reformation. Following the breakdown of monastic institutions and [[scholasticism]] in late medieval Europe, accentuated by the \"Babylonian Captivity\" of the Avignon Papacy, the [[Western Schism|Great Schism]], and the failure of the [[Conciliar movement]], the 16th century saw the fomenting of a great cultural debate about religious reforms and later fundamental religious values. Historians would generally assume that the failure to reform (too many vested interests, lack of coordination in the reforming coalition) would eventually lead to a greater upheaval or even revolution since the system must eventually be adjusted or disintegrate, and the failure of the Conciliar movement helped lead to the [[Protestant Reformation]] in Europe. These frustrated reformist movements ranged from [[nominalism]], [[Devotio Moderna|devotio moderna (modern devotion)]], to [[humanism]] occurring in conjunction with economic, political and demographic forces that contributed to a growing disaffection with the wealth and power of the elite [[clergy]], sensitizing the population to the financial and moral corruption of the secular [[Renaissance]] church.\n\nThe outcome of the [[Black Death]] encouraged a radical reorganization of the economy and eventually of European society. In the emerging urban centers, however, the calamities of the 14th and early 15th century, and the resultant labor shortages, provided a strong impetus for economic diversification and technological innovations. Following the Black Death, the initial loss of life from famine, plague, and pestilence contributed to an intensification of [[capital accumulation]] in the urban areas and thus a stimulus to trade, industry, and burgeoning urban growth in fields as diverse as banking (the [[Fugger]] banking family in [[Augsburg]] and the [[Medici]] family of [[Florence]] being the most prominent); textiles, [[Weapon|armaments]], especially stimulated by the [[Hundred Years' War]], and mining of iron ore with the booming armaments industry. Accumulation of surplus, competitive [[overproduction]], and heightened competition to maximize economic advantage contributed to civil war, aggressive [[militarism]], and thus to centralization. As a direct result of the move toward centralization, leaders like [[Louis XI of France]] sought to remove all constitutional restrictions on the exercise of their authority. In [[England]], [[France]], and [[Spain]] the move toward centralization begun in the 13th century was carried to a successful conclusion.\n\nBut as recovery and prosperity progressed, enabling the population to reach its former levels in the late 15th and 16th centuries, the combination of both a newly-abundant labor supply as well as improved productivity, were 'mixed blessings' for many segments of Western European society. Despite tradition, landlords started the move to exclude [[peasant]]s from \"[[common land]]s\". With trade stimulated, landowners increasingly moved away from the [[Manorialism|manorial]] economy. Woolen manufacturing greatly expanded in [[France]], [[Germany]], and the [[Netherlands]] and new textile industries began to develop.\n\nThe invention of [[movable type]] leads to the Protestant zeal for translating the Bible and getting it into the hands of the laity.  This would advance the culture of Biblical literacy.\n\nThe \"humanism\" of the [[Renaissance]] period stimulated unprecedented academic ferment, and a concern for [[academic freedom]]. Ongoing, earnest theoretical debates occurred in the universities about the nature of the church, and the source and extent of the authority of the papacy, of councils, and of princes.<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Gonz\u00e1lez | first = Justo L.\n | title = The Story of Christianity: Vol. 1: The Early Church to the Reformation\n | url = https://archive.org/details/storyofchristian01gonz | url-access = registration | location = San Francisco\n | publisher = Harper\n | year = 1984\n | isbn = 0-06-063315-8\n }}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Latourette\n | first = Kenneth Scott\n | authorlink = Kenneth Scott Latourette\n | title = A History of Christianity, Volume 1: Beginnings to 1500 (Revised)\n | year = 1975\n | location = San Francisco\n | publisher = Harper\n | isbn = 0-06-064952-6\n | url-access = registration\n | url = https://archive.org/details/historyofchristi01lato\n }}</ref>\n\n==Spread of Christianity==\nThrough the late 15th and early 16th centuries, European missionaries and explorers spread Catholicism to the [[Americas]], [[Asia]], [[Africa]] and [[Oceania]].

It also marked the later years of [[scholasticism]]\n\n==Eastern Orthodoxy==\n\n===Reunion attempts===\nThe eastern Emperor [[John VIII Palaeologus]], pressed hard by the [[Ottoman Turks]], was keen to ally himself with the West, and to do so he arranged with [[Pope Eugene IV]] for discussions about reunion to be held again, this time at the [[Council of Ferrara-Florence]]. After several long discussions, the emperor managed to convince the Eastern representatives to accept the Western doctrines of Filioque, Purgatory and the supremacy of the Papacy. On 6 June 1439, an agreement was signed by all the Eastern bishops present but one, [[Mark of Ephesus]], who held that Rome continued in both [[heresy]] and [[Schism (religion)|schism]]. It seemed that the Great Schism had been ended. However, upon their return, the Eastern bishops found their agreement with the West broadly rejected by the populace and by civil authorities (with the notable exception of the emperors of the East who remained committed to union until the [[Fall of Constantinople]] two decades later). The union signed at Florence has never been accepted by the Eastern churches.\n\n=== Fall of Constantinople ===\n[[File:Theofilos Palaiologos.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Painting by the Greek folk painter [[Theophilos Hatzimihail]] showing the battle inside the city, Constantine is visible on a white horse]]\nIn 1453, the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] fell to the [[Ottoman Empire]]. But Orthodoxy was still very strong in [[Russia]] which became autocephalous (since 1448, although this was not officially accepted by Constantinople until 1589); and thus [[Moscow]] called itself the [[Third Rome]], as the cultural heir of [[Constantinople]].\n\nEastern Christians expressed a belief that the fall of Constantinople was God's punishment for the emperor and clergy accepting the West's doctrines of [[filioque]], [[purgatory]] and the supremacy of the [[papacy]]. The West did not fulfill its promise to the Eastern emperor of troops and support if he agreed to the reconciliation. The [[Sack of Constantinople]] is still considered proof by the East that the West ultimately succeeded in its endeavor to destroy the East.\n\nUnder Ottoman rule, the Orthodox Church acquired power as an autonomous millet. The ecumenical patriarch was the religious and administrative ruler of the entire [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)#Orthodox Christians|Rum Millet]] (Ottoman administrative unit), which encompassed all the Eastern Orthodox subjects of the empire. Those appointed to the role were chosen by the Muslims rulers not the Church.\n\nAs a result of the Ottoman conquest, the entire Orthodox communion of the Balkans and the Near East became suddenly isolated from the West. For the next four hundred years, it was confined within the Islamic world, with which it had little in common religiously or culturally. The Orthodox Churches from [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] states, [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]] were the only part of the Orthodox communion that remained outside the control of the Ottoman Empire.\n\n[[File:Stavronikita Aug2006.jpg|thumb|330px|right|Stavronikita monastery, South-East view]]\n\n===Isolation from the West===\nAs a result of the Ottoman conquest of the Byzantine Empire in 1453, and the [[Fall of Constantinople]], the entire Orthodox communion of the Balkans and the Near East became suddenly isolated from the West. For the next four hundred years, it was confined within a hostile Islamic world, with which it had little in common religiously or culturally. The [[Russian Orthodox Church]] was the only part of the Orthodox communion which remained outside the control of the Ottoman Empire. It is, in part, due to this geographical and intellectual confinement that the voice of Eastern Orthodoxy was not heard during the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in 16th-century Europe. As a result, this important theological debate often seems strange and distorted to the Orthodox. They never took part in it and thus neither Reformation nor [[Counter-Reformation]] is part of their theological framework.\n\n===Religious rights under the Ottoman Empire===\n{{Further|Islam and anti-Christian persecution}}\n[[Islam]] recognized [[Jesus]] as a great prophet and considered Christians as another [[People of the Book]]. But it imposed severe penalties including frequent deaths for non Muslims. As such, the Church was not extinguished nor was its canonical and hierarchical organization completely destroyed. Its administration continued to function though in lesser degree, no longer being the state religion. One of the first things that [[Mehmed II|Mehmet the Conqueror]] did was to allow the Church to elect a new patriarch, [[Gennadius Scholarius]]. The [[Hagia Sophia]] and the [[Parthenon]], which had been Christian churches for nearly a millennium, were converted into mosques, yet most other churches, both in Constantinople and elsewhere, remained in Christian hands. Because [[Sharia|Islamic law]] makes no distinction between nationality and religion, all Christians, regardless of their language or nationality, were considered a single [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet]], or nation. The patriarch, as the highest ranking hierarch, was thus invested with civil and religious authority and made [[ethnarch]], head of the entire Christian Orthodox population. Practically, this meant that all Orthodox Churches within Ottoman territory were under the control of Constantinople. Thus, the authority and jurisdictional frontiers of the patriarch were enormously enlarged.\n\nHowever, these [[Dhimmitude|rights and privileges]], including freedom of worship and religious organisation, were often established in principle but seldom corresponded to reality. The legal privileges of the patriarch and the Church depended, in fact, on the whim and mercy of the [[Sultan]] and the [[Sublime Porte]], while all Christians were viewed as second-class citizens. Moreover, Turkish corruption and brutality were not a myth. That it was the \"infidel\" Christian who experienced this more than anyone else is not in doubt. Nor were pogroms of Christians in these centuries unknown (see [[Greco-Turkish relations]]).<ref name=AIHG-NYT>[http://www.aihgs.com/New%20York%20Times.htm The Australian Institute for Holocaust and Genocide Studies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607184704/http://www.aihgs.com/New%20York%20Times.htm |date=2007-06-07 }} ''The New York Times''.</ref><ref>http://www.helleniccomserve.com/pdf/BlkBkPontusPrinceton.pdf</ref> Devastating, too, for the Church was the fact that it could not bear witness to Christ. Missionary work among Muslims was dangerous and indeed impossible, whereas conversion to Islam was entirely legal and permissible. Converts to Islam who returned to Orthodoxy were put to death as apostates. No new churches could be built, and even the ringing of church bells was prohibited. Education of the clergy and the Christian population either ceased altogether or was reduced to the most rudimentary elements.\n\n===Corruption===\nThe Orthodox Church found itself subject to the Turkish system of corruption. The patriarchal throne was frequently sold to the highest bidder, while new patriarchal investiture was accompanied by heavy payment to the government. In order to recoup their losses, patriarchs and bishops taxed the local parishes and their clergy. The patriarchal throne was never secure. Few patriarchs between the 15th and the 19th centuries died a natural death while in office. The forced abdications, exiles, hangings, drownings, and poisonings of patriarchs are well documented. But if the patriarch's position was precarious so was the hierarchy's.\n\n===Devshirmeh===\n[[Devshirmeh]] was the system of the collection of young boys from conquered Christian lands by the Ottoman sultans as a form of regular taxation in order to build a loyal  army (formerly largely composed of war captives) and the class of (military) administrators called the \"[[Janissary|Janissaries]]\", or other servants such as tellak in hamams. The word ''dev\u015firme'' means \"collecting, gathering\" in [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]]. Boys delivered to the Ottomans in this way were called ''[[ghilm\u00e1n]]'' or ''acemi oglanlar'' (\"novice boys\").\n\n===Antioch===\nThe Church of Antioch was moved to [[Damascus]] in response to the Ottoman invasion of Antioch. Its traditional territory includes Syria, Lebanon, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait and parts of Turkey. The remainder of the Church of Antioch, primarily local Greeks or Hellenized sections of the indigenous population, remained in communion with Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, and Jerusalem\n\n==Western Christianity==\n\n===Western Schism ===\n{{Main|Western Schism}}\n\nIn 1409, a council was convened at [[Pisa]] to resolve the issue. The council declared both existing popes to be schismatic ([[Gregory XII]] from Rome; [[Antipope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]] from Avignon) and appointed a new one, [[Antipope Alexander V|Alexander V]]. But the existing popes refused to resign, and thus there were three papal claimants. Another council was convened in 1414, the [[Council of Constance]]. In March 1415 the Pisan pope, [[John XXIII]], fled from Constance in disguise; he was brought back a prisoner and deposed in May. The Roman pope, Gregory XII, resigned voluntarily in July. The Avignon pope, Benedict XIII, refused to come to Constance; nor would he consider resignation. The council finally deposed him in July 1417. The council in Constance, having finally cleared the field of popes and antipopes, elected [[Pope Martin V]] as pope in November.\n\n=== Italian Renaissance (1399\u20131599) ===\n[[File:Michelangelo's Pieta 5450 cropncleaned.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Michelangelo's ''Piet\u00e0'' in St. Peter's Basilica, Vatican City]]\nThe [[Italian Renaissance]] was a period of great cultural change and achievement, marked in Italy by a classical orientation and an increase of wealth through mercantile trade. The city of Rome, the Papacy, and the Papal States were all affected by the Renaissance. On the one hand, it was a time of great artistic patronage and architectural magnificence, where the Church supported such artists as [[Michelangelo]], [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]], [[Donato Bramante|Bramante]], [[Raphael]], [[Fra Angelico]], [[Donatello]], and [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. On the other hand, wealthy Italian families often secured episcopal offices, including the papacy, for their own members, some of whom were known for immorality, such as [[Pope Alexander VI|Alexander VI]] and [[Pope Sixtus IV|Sixtus IV]].\n\n===Scholasticism===\nScholastic theology continued to develop as the 13th century gave way to the fourteenth, becoming ever more complex and subtle in its distinctions and arguments.  The 14th century saw in particular the rise to dominance of the [[nominalism|nominalist]] or [[voluntarism (metaphysics)|voluntarist]] theologies of men like [[William of Ockham]].  The 14th century was also a time in which movements of widely varying character worked for the reform of the institutional church, such as [[conciliarism]], [[Lollardy]] and the [[Hussite]]s.  Spiritual movements such as the [[Devotio Moderna]] also flourished.\n\nNotable authors include:\n[[File:Hus na kazatelne.jpg|thumb|right|160pf|Jan Hus preaching, illumination from a Czech manuscript, 1490s]]\n* [[Jan Hus]] (c.1369\u20131415)\n* [[Pierre d'Ailly]] (1351\u20131420)\n* [[Jean Gerson]] (1363\u20131429)\n* [[Nicholas of Clemanges]] (1360\u20131440)\n* [[Nicholas of Cusa]] (1401\u20131464)\n* [[Thomas a Kempis]] (1380\u20131471)\n* [[Denis the Carthusian]] (1402\u20131471)\n* [[Rudolf Agricola]] (1444\u20131485)\n* [[Wessel Gansfort]] (1419\u20131489)\n* [[Gabriel Biel]] (1425\u20131495)\n* [[Johann Heynlin]] (1425\u20131496) \n* [[Girolamo Savonarola]] (1452\u20131498)\n* [[Jan Standonck]] (1454\u20131504)\n* [[Conrad Celtis]] (1459\u20131508)\n* [[Johann Geiler]] (1445\u20131510)\n* [[John Colet]] (1467\u20131519)\n* [[Johann Reuchlin]] (1455\u20131522)\n* [[Ulrich von Hutten]] (1488\u20131523)\n* [[Johann von Staupitz]] (1460\u20131524)\n* [[Jacob Wimpfeling]] (1450\u20131528)\n* [[Jacques Lefevre d'Etaples]] (1455\u20131536)\n* [[Desiderius Erasmus]] (1466\u20131536)\n\n===Protestant Reformation roots and precursors===\n{{see also|Bohemian Reformation}}\n[[Image: Jagie\u0142\u0142o dispute.JPG|right|thumb|Hussite theologians dispute in the presence of King [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o]] of Poland]]\nThe Council of Constance confirmed strengthened the traditional medieval conception of Churches and Empires. It did not address the national tensions or the theological tensions which had been stirred up during the previous century. The council could not prevent [[Schism (religion)|schisms]] and the [[Hussite Wars]] in [[Bohemia]].<ref>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Hussites |volume=14 |pages=7\u20139 |first=Franti\u0161ek |last=L\u00fctzow }}</ref>\n\nHistorical upheaval usually yields much new thinking as to how society should be organized. This was the case leading up to the Protestant Reformation. Following the breakdown of monastic institutions and [[scholasticism]] in late medieval Europe, accentuated by the \"Babylonian Captivity\" of the Avignon Papacy, the [[Western Schism|Great Schism]], and the failure of the [[Conciliar movement]], the 16th century saw the fomenting of a great cultural debate about religious reforms and later fundamental religious values. Historians would generally assume that the failure to reform (too many vested interests, lack of coordination in the reforming coalition) would eventually lead to a greater upheaval or even revolution since the system must eventually be adjusted or disintegrate, and the failure of the Conciliar movement helped lead to the [[Protestant Reformation]] in Europe. These frustrated reformist movements ranged from [[nominalism]], [[Devotio Moderna|devotio moderna (modern devotion)]], to [[humanism]] occurring in conjunction with economic, political and demographic forces that contributed to a growing disaffection with the wealth and power of the elite [[clergy]], sensitizing the population to the financial and moral corruption of the secular [[Renaissance]] church.\n\nThe outcome of the [[Black Death]] encouraged a radical reorganization of the economy and eventually of European society. In the emerging urban centers, however, the calamities of the 14th and early 15th century, and the resultant labor shortages, provided a strong impetus for economic diversification and technological innovations. Following the Black Death, the initial loss of life from famine, plague, and pestilence contributed to an intensification of [[capital accumulation]] in the urban areas and thus a stimulus to trade, industry, and burgeoning urban growth in fields as diverse as banking (the [[Fugger]] banking family in [[Augsburg]] and the [[Medici]] family of [[Florence]] being the most prominent); textiles, [[Weapon|armaments]], especially stimulated by the [[Hundred Years' War]], and mining of iron ore with the booming armaments industry. Accumulation of surplus, competitive [[overproduction]], and heightened competition to maximize economic advantage contributed to civil war, aggressive [[militarism]], and thus to centralization. As a direct result of the move toward centralization, leaders like [[Louis XI of France]] sought to remove all constitutional restrictions on the exercise of their authority. In [[England]], [[France]], and [[Spain]] the move toward centralization begun in the 13th century was carried to a successful conclusion.\n\nBut as recovery and prosperity progressed, enabling the population to reach its former levels in the late 15th and 16th centuries, the combination of both a newly-abundant labor supply as well as improved productivity, were 'mixed blessings' for many segments of Western European society. Despite tradition, landlords started the move to exclude [[peasant]]s from \"[[common land]]s\". With trade stimulated, landowners increasingly moved away from the [[Manorialism|manorial]] economy. Woolen manufacturing greatly expanded in [[France]], [[Germany]], and the [[Netherlands]] and new textile industries began to develop.\n\nThe invention of [[movable type]] leads to the Protestant zeal for translating the Bible and getting it into the hands of the laity.  This would advance the culture of Biblical literacy.\n\nThe \"humanism\" of the [[Renaissance]] period stimulated unprecedented academic ferment, and a concern for [[academic freedom]]. Ongoing, earnest theoretical debates occurred in the universities about the nature of the church, and the source and extent of the authority of the papacy, of councils, and of princes.<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Gonz\u00e1lez | first = Justo L.\n | title = The Story of Christianity: Vol. 1: The Early Church to the Reformation\n | url = https://archive.org/details/storyofchristian01gonz | url-access = registration | location = San Francisco\n | publisher = Harper\n | year = 1984\n | isbn = 0-06-063315-8\n }}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Latourette\n | first = Kenneth Scott\n | authorlink = Kenneth Scott Latourette\n | title = A History of Christianity, Volume 1: Beginnings to 1500 (Revised)\n | year = 1975\n | location = San Francisco\n | publisher = Harper\n | isbn = 0-06-064952-6\n | url-access = registration\n | url = https://archive.org/details/historyofchristi01lato\n }}</ref>\n\n==Spread of Christianity==\nThrough the late 15th and early 16th centuries, European missionaries and explorers spread Catholicism to the [[Americas]], [[Asia]], [[Africa]] and [[Oceania]].

The elementary school for the district is Wilshire Park Elementary. Additionally, St. Charles Borromeo offers private school education for grades K-8. \n\n==Academics==\nSt. Anthony traditionally does very well in standardized tests in the state and is quite successful academically.

Cats hiss when they are startled, scared, angry, or in pain, and also to scare off intruders into their territory. If the hiss and growl warning does not remove the threat, an attack by the cat may follow. Kittens as young as two to three weeks will hiss and spit when first picked up by a human. \"Spitting\" is a shorter but louder and more emphatic version of hissing.<ref name=\"Miller\" />\n[[file:Lion_raring-sound1TamilNadu178.ogg|right|thumb|Familiar lion's roar recorded from a big cat in captivity.]]\n\n=== Howl, yowl, moan, and wail ===\nThese sounds are commonly used during threatening situations.

There are various responses such as when cats arch their backs, erect their hairs and adopt a sideward posture to communicate fear or aggression.  Others may be only a single behavioural change (as perceived by humans) such as slowly blinking to signal relaxation.\n\nDomestic cats frequently use visual communication with their eyes, ears, mouths, tails, coats and body postures.

Its breathing is slow to normal, with legs bent, or hind legs laid out or extended.  The tail is loosely wrapped, extended, or held up. It also hangs down loosely when the cat is standing. When cats are calm, they tend to stand relaxed with a still tail.  \n*'''Stretching posture''' \u2013 another posture indicating the cat is relaxed. When cats lie on their back with their belly exposed, they are in a position of vulnerability.  Therefore, this position may communicate a feeling of trust<ref>{{cite book|last1=Fraser|first1=Andrew|title=Feline Behaviour and Welfare|date=2012|publisher=C.A.B. International|location=Wallingford, Oxfordshire, UK|pages=58}}</ref> or comfort; however, cats may also roll onto their back to defend themselves with their claws, or to bask in areas of bright sunlight.\n*'''Yawning posture''' \u2013 either by itself, or in conjunction with a stretch: another posture of a relaxed cat.  Having the mouth open and no teeth exposed indicates playfulness.<ref>{{cite book|title=Communicating with your cat|first=J.

Its back is almost horizontal when standing and moving. Its breathing is normal, with its legs bent or extended (when standing). Its tail is curved back or straight upwards, and there may be twitching while the tail is positioned downwards.\n*'''Tense posture''' \u2013 The cat is lying on its belly, with the back of its body lower than its upper body (slinking) when standing or moving back. Its hind legs are bent and front legs are extended when standing. Its tail is close to the body, tensed or curled downwards; there can be twitching when the cat is standing up.\n*'''Anxious/ovulating posture''' \u2013 The cat is lying on its belly. The back of the body is more visibly lower than the front part when the cat is standing or moving. Its breathing may be fast, and its legs are tucked under its body. The tail is close to the body and may be curled forward (or close to the body when standing), with the tip of the tail moving up and down (or side to side).\n*'''Fearful posture''' \u2013 The cat is lying on its belly or crouching directly on top of its paws. Its entire body may be shaking and very near the ground when standing up. Breathing is also fast, with its legs bent near the surface, and its tail curled and very close to its body when standing on all fours.  A fearful, defensive cat makes itself smaller, lowers itself toward the ground, arches its back and leans its body away from the threat rather than forward.  Fighting usually occurs only when escape is impossible.<ref name=\"Miller\" />\n*'''Confident posture''' \u2013 The cat may walk around in a more comfortable manner with its tail up to the sky indicating their importance. Cats often walk through houses with their tail standing up high above them making them look grander and more elegant.\n*'''Terrified posture''' \u2013 The cat is crouched directly on top of its paws, with visible shaking seen in some parts of the body. Its tail is close to the body, and it can be standing up, together with its hair at the back. The legs are very stiff or even bent to increase their size. Typically, cats avoid contact when they feel threatened, although they can resort to varying degrees of aggression when they feel cornered, or when escape is impossible.<ref>{{cite web|title=Reading Your Cat|url=http://animal.discovery.com/cat-guide/cat-behavior/reading-your-cat.html|publisher=Animal Planet|accessdate=22 December 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111121232348/http://animal.discovery.com/cat-guide/cat-behavior/reading-your-cat.html|archivedate=21 November 2011}}</ref>\n*'''Aggressive posture''' \u2013 The hind legs stiffen, the rump elevates but the back stays flat, tail hairs are erected, the nose is pushed forward and the ears are pulled back slightly.  Because cats have both claws and teeth, they can easily cause injury if they become involved in a fight, so this posture is an attempt to elicit deference by a competitor without fighting.  The aggressor may attempt to make challengers retreat and will pursue them if they do not flee. \n\n[[File:Abby playing in basket.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A [[tortoiseshell cat]] with erect hairs on its tail and back which in this context indicates excitement or curiosity]]\n\n===Ears===\nCats can change the position of their ears very quickly, in a continuum from erect when the cat is alert and focused, slightly relaxed when the cat is calm, and flattened against the head when extremely defensive or aggressive.<ref name=\"catwatch\" /> In cats, flattened ears generally indicate that an individual feels threatened and may attack.\n\nFlattening of the ears is also a biological adaptation for stalking prey in grass or in a hiding place where the cat's erect ears would give away its position.\n\n===Eyes===\nA direct stare by a cat usually communicates a challenge or threat and is more likely to be seen in high-ranking cats; lower-ranking cats usually withdraw in response.<ref name=\"Miller\" /> The direct stare is often used during [[predation]] or for territorial reasons.\n\nIn contrast to a direct stare, cats will lower their eyelids or slowly blink them to show trust and affection to their owners. According to Gary Weitzman, a licensed veterinarian and animal author, this type of feline body language is similar to a \"kitty kiss\". He further explains in his book, \"How To Speak Cat: A Guide to Decoding Cat Language,\" that slow blinking could be a physiological response to lowered stress hormonal levels from being in a calm state.\n\n\"The slow blink really is an acceptance gesture,\" Weitzman says. \"They do that when they're absolutely comfortable with you, and they do it with other cats as well.\" It is not clear why cats do this when they are feeling calm and comfortable, but Weitzman writes, \"it's likely an autonomic response \u2026 having to do with the cat having its cortisol [stress hormone] levels down.\"\n\nIn fact, Weitzman encourages cat owners to mimic this behavior to return not only a message of affection, but one that reinforces a nonthreatening position. This behavior is not exclusive to domestic house cats. Since cats can be very territorial, in the wild they utilize this slow blinking with other cats to signal themselves as friendly or nonthreatening.<ref>{{Cite book|title=How to speak cat : a guide to decoding cat language|last=Alexander|first=Newman, Aline|others=Weitzman, Gary|isbn=9781426318634|location=Washington, D.C.|oclc=880756959|year = 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Tail===\nCats often use their tails to communicate. A cat holding its tail vertically generally indicates positive emotions such as happiness or confidence; the vertical tail is often used as a friendly greeting toward human beings or other cats (usually close relatives).  A half-raised tail can indicate less pleasure, and unhappiness is indicated with a tail held low. In addition, a cat's tail may swing from side to side.  If this motion is slow and \"lazy\", it generally indicates that the cat is in a relaxed state.  Cats will twitch the tip of their tail when hunting or when otherwise alert or playful. Abrupt, full-tail twitching indicates a state of indecision.<!-- This isn't relevant to the scope of this article, but the example Morris uses is a cat who steps outside and discovers it's raining.

This tail behavior is also seen when a cat has become \"irritated\" and is nearing the point of lashing out, typically by biting or swatting with claws extended.  A cat may also twitch its tail when playing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iams.com/iams/pet-health/cat-body-language.jsp|title=Cat articles on Iams website|publisher=|access-date=2009-11-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100225152840/http://www.iams.com/iams/pet-health/cat-body-language.jsp|archive-date=2010-02-25|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nSometimes during play, a cat, or more commonly, a kitten, will raise the base of its tail high and stiffen all but the tip into a shape like an upside-down \"U\". This signals great excitement, to the point of hyperactivity. This may also be seen when younger cats chase each other, or when they run around by themselves. When greeting their owner, cats often hold their tails straight up with a quivering motion that indicates extreme happiness.<ref>{{cite web|title=Common Cat Behaviors|url=http://www.best-cat-tips.com/common_cat_behaviors.htm|work=Best Cat Tips|publisher=www.best-cat-tips.com|accessdate=28 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503205251/http://best-cat-tips.com/common_cat_behaviors.htm|archive-date=3 May 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>  A scared or surprised cat may erect the hairs on its tail and back.  In addition, it may stand more upright and turn its body sideways to increase its apparent size as a threat. Tailless cats, such as the [[Manx (cat)|Manx]], which possess only a small stub of a tail, move the stub around as if they have a full tail.\n\n==Tactile communication==\n\n=== Grooming ===\n[[File:Cat Self-Cleaning 1 2016-07-26.webm|thumb|alt=|Cat grooming itself.]]\nCats often lick other cats as [[allogrooming]] or to bond (this grooming is usually done between familiar cats). They also sometimes lick humans, which may indicate affection. \n\nOral grooming for domestic and feral cats is a common behavior; recent studies on domestic cats show that they spend about 8% of resting time grooming themselves. Grooming is extremely important not only to clean themselves but also to ensure ectoparasite control. Fleas tend to be the most common ectoparasite of cats and some studies allude to indirect evidence that grooming in cats is effective in dislodging fleas from the head and neck. Cats not only use their tongue for grooming to control ectoparasites, but also to scratch itchy areas of the body.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Eckstein | first1 = Robert A. | last2 = Hart | first2 = Benjamin L. | year = 2000 | title = Grooming and Control of Fleas in Cats | url = | journal = Applied Animal Behaviour Science | volume = 68 | issue = 2| pages = 141\u201350 | doi=10.1016/s0168-1591(00)00095-2| pmid = 10771322 }}</ref>\n\n===Kneading===\n[[File:Amasamiento de un gato.ogv|thumb|Classic kneading of a cat]]\nCats sometimes repeatedly tread their front paws on humans or soft objects with a [[Kneading (cats)|kneading action]].  This is instinctive to kittens and adults, and is presumably derived from the action used to stimulate milk let-down by the mother during nursing.  Kittens \"knead\" the breast while suckling, using the forelimbs one at a time in an alternating pattern to push against the mammary glands to stimulate lactation in the mother. Kneading may also have an origin going back to cats' wild ancestors who had to tread down grass or foliage to make a temporary nest in which to rest.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schwartz|first=Stefanie|date=2003|title=Separation anxiety syndrome in dogs and cats|journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association|language=en|volume=222|issue=11|pages=1526\u20131532|doi=10.2460/javma.2003.222.1526|pmid=12784957|issn=0003-1488|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7ea1f3d064138bcb48fbfede733dbf7e17bb905a}}</ref>\n\nCats carry these infantile behaviors beyond nursing and into adulthood. Some cats \"nurse,\" i.e. suck, on clothing or bedding during kneading. The cat exerts firm downwards pressure with its paw, spreading its toes to expose its claws, then curls its toes as it lifts its paw. The process takes place with alternate paws at intervals of one to two seconds. They may knead while sitting on their owner's lap, which may prove painful if the cat has sharp claws.\n\nSince most of the preferred \"domestic traits\" are [[Neoteny#Domestication|neotenous]] or juvenile traits that persist in the adult, kneading may be a relic juvenile behavior retained in adult domestic cats.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Schwartz|first1=Stefanie|title=Separation anxiety syndrome in dogs and cats|journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association|date=June 2003|volume=222|issue=11|pages=1526\u201332|accessdate=|doi=10.2460/javma.2003.222.1526|pmid=12784957|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7ea1f3d064138bcb48fbfede733dbf7e17bb905a}}</ref> It may also [[stimulate]] the cat and make it feel good, in the same manner as a human [[stretching]]. Kneading is often a precursor to [[sleep]]ing. Many cats [[purr]] while kneading, usually taken to indicate contentment and affection. They also purr mostly when newborn, when feeding, or when trying to feed on their mother's teat. The common association between the two behaviors may corroborate the evidence in favor of the origin of kneading as a remnant instinct.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=McPherson|first1=F.J|last2=Chenoweth|first2=P.J|title=Mammalian sexual dimorphism|journal=Animal Reproduction Science|date=April 2012|volume=131|issue=3\u20134|pages=109\u2013122|accessdate=|doi=10.1016/j.anireprosci.2012.02.007|pmid=22482798}}</ref>\n\nCats have scent glands on the underside of their paws.

This tactile action is combined with olfactory communication as the contact leaves scent from glands located around the mouth and cheeks.

Unlike a [[dog's penis]], a [[cat's penis]] points backward. Although cats may mark with both sprayed and non-sprayed urine, the spray is usually more thick and oily than normally deposited urine, and may contain additional secretions from anal sacs that help the sprayer to make a stronger communication.  While cats mark their territory both by rubbing of the scent glands and by urine and fecal deposits, spraying seems to be the \"loudest\" feline olfactory statement. It is most frequently observed in intact male cats in competition with other males. Males neutered in adulthood may still spray after neutering.  Female cats also sometimes spray.<ref name=\"Miller\" />\n\nA cat that urinates outside the litter box may indicate dissatisfaction with the box, due to a variety of factors such as substrate texture, cleanliness and privacy. It can also be a sign of [[Feline lower urinary tract disease|urinary tract problems]]. Male cats on poor diets are susceptible to crystal formation in the urine which can block the urethra and create a medical emergency.\n\nThe urine of mature male cats in particular contains the [[amino acid]] known as [[felinine]] which is a precursor to [[3-mercapto-3-methylbutan-1-ol]] (MMB), the sulfur-containing compound that gives cat urine its characteristically strong odor.

The drive is hunger, the cue is the prey, the response is to catch the prey, and the reward is to relieve the hunger sensation.\n\nKittens also show observational learning when they are socializing with humans.

The cat will then draw in on itself and prepare to attack if needed.<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite book|title=Cat Behaviour: The Predatory & Social Behaviour of Domestic & Wild Cats|last=Leyhausen|first=Paul|publisher=Garland Publishing Inc.|year=1979|isbn=978-0-8240-7017-5|location=New York, New York|pages=164\u2013216, 227\u2013231}}</ref> The subordinate cat will usually run away before a physical altercation ensues; however, this is not always the case, and what is known as a \"tomcat duel\" may follow.<ref name=\":13\"/> Dominance is also seen as an underlying factor for how [[Biological specificity|conspecifics]] interact with each other.\n==== Dominance ====\nDominance can be seen among cats in multi-cat households. \"Subordinate\" cats submit to the \"dominant\" cat. Dominance includes such behaviours as walking around the dominant cat, waiting for the dominant cat to walk past, avoiding eye contact, crouching, laying on its side (defensive posture), and retreating when the dominant cat approaches.<ref name=\":22\"/> Dominant cats present a specific body posture as well. The cat displays ears straight up, the base of its tail will be arched, and it looks directly at subordinate cats.<ref name=\":22\" /> These dominant cats are usually not aggressive, but if a subordinate cat blocks the food source they may become aggressive.<ref name=\":42\">{{Cite book|title=The Cat: History, Biology, and Behaviour.|last=Beadle|first=Muriel|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=1977|isbn=978-0-671-22451-6|location=New York, New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/cathistorybiolog00bead/page/100 100\u2013111]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/cathistorybiolog00bead/page/100}}</ref> When this aggressive behaviour occurs, it could also lead to the dominant cat preventing subordinate cats from eating and using the litter box.<ref name=\":22\" /> This can cause the subordinate cat to defecate somewhere else and create problems with human interaction.<ref name=\":22\" />\n==== Social conflicts ====\n[[File:Fighting cat (crop).jpg|thumb|Two cats fighting]]\nSocial conflicts among cats depend solely on the behaviour of the cats. Some research has shown that cats rarely pick fights, but when they do its usually for protecting food and/or litters, and defending territory.<ref name=\":42\"/>\n\nThe first sign of an imminent tomcat duel is when both cats draw themselves up high on their legs, all hair along the middle of their backs is standing straight up, and they mew and howl loudly as they approach one another.<ref name=\":13\"/> The steps the cats make become slower and shorter the closer they become to one another. Once they are close enough to attack, they pause slightly, and then one cat leaps and tries to bite the nape of the other cat.<ref name=\":13\" /> The other cat has no choice but to retaliate and both cats roll aggressively on the ground, and loud intense screams come from both cats.<ref name=\":13\" /> After some time,the cats separate and stand face to face to begin the attack all over again. This can go on for some time until one cat does not get up again and remains seated.<ref name=\":13\" /> The defeated cat does not move until the victor has completed a sniff of the area and moves outside the fighting area. Once this happens, the defeated cat leaves the area, ending the duel.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nFemales may also fight with each other. If a male and female do not get along, they may also fight.

Others may be only a single behavioural change (as perceived by humans) such as slowly blinking to signal relaxation.\n\nDomestic cats frequently use visual communication with their eyes, ears, mouths, tails, coats and body postures.  It has been stated that a cat's facial features change the most and are probably the best indicator of cat communication.<ref name=\"Miller\" />\n\n===Posture ===\n[[File:Surprised cat.jpg|thumb|right|150px|upright|Surprised cats have enlarged pupils and erect ears held slightly backwards.]]\n\nA cat's posture communicates its emotions.  It is best to observe cats' natural behavior when they are by themselves, with humans, and with other animals.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Indoor Cat Initiative|url=http://www.vet.ohio-state.edu/assets/pdf/education/courses/vm720/topic/indoorcatmanual.pdf|publisher=The Ohio State University, College of Veterinary Medicine|accessdate=22 December 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118090619/http://www.vet.ohio-state.edu/assets/pdf/education/courses/vm720/topic/indoorcatmanual.pdf|archive-date=2012-01-18|url-status=dead}}</ref> Their postures can be friendly or aggressive, depending upon the situation.  Some of the most basic and familiar cat postures include the following:<ref>{{cite web|title=Test to determine how well you know feline body language|url=http://dusikcat.com/felines/tests/1-how-well-do-you-know-cats-language/?src=wiki|access-date=2016-09-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180620153255/https://dusikcat.com/felines/tests/1-how-well-do-you-know-cats-language/?src=wiki|archive-date=2018-06-20|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=An Ethogram for Behavioral Studies of the Domestic Cat|publisher=UFAW Animal Welfare Research Report No 8.

Its breathing is slow to normal, with legs bent, or hind legs laid out or extended.  The tail is loosely wrapped, extended, or held up. It also hangs down loosely when the cat is standing. When cats are calm, they tend to stand relaxed with a still tail.  \n*'''Stretching posture''' \u2013 another posture indicating the cat is relaxed. When cats lie on their back with their belly exposed, they are in a position of vulnerability.  Therefore, this position may communicate a feeling of trust<ref>{{cite book|last1=Fraser|first1=Andrew|title=Feline Behaviour and Welfare|date=2012|publisher=C.A.B. International|location=Wallingford, Oxfordshire, UK|pages=58}}</ref> or comfort; however, cats may also roll onto their back to defend themselves with their claws, or to bask in areas of bright sunlight.\n*'''Yawning posture''' \u2013 either by itself, or in conjunction with a stretch: another posture of a relaxed cat.  Having the mouth open and no teeth exposed indicates playfulness.<ref>{{cite book|title=Communicating with your cat|first=J.

Its back is almost horizontal when standing and moving. Its breathing is normal, with its legs bent or extended (when standing). Its tail is curved back or straight upwards, and there may be twitching while the tail is positioned downwards.\n*'''Tense posture''' \u2013 The cat is lying on its belly, with the back of its body lower than its upper body (slinking) when standing or moving back. Its hind legs are bent and front legs are extended when standing. Its tail is close to the body, tensed or curled downwards; there can be twitching when the cat is standing up.\n*'''Anxious/ovulating posture''' \u2013 The cat is lying on its belly. The back of the body is more visibly lower than the front part when the cat is standing or moving. Its breathing may be fast, and its legs are tucked under its body. The tail is close to the body and may be curled forward (or close to the body when standing), with the tip of the tail moving up and down (or side to side).\n*'''Fearful posture''' \u2013 The cat is lying on its belly or crouching directly on top of its paws. Its entire body may be shaking and very near the ground when standing up. Breathing is also fast, with its legs bent near the surface, and its tail curled and very close to its body when standing on all fours.  A fearful, defensive cat makes itself smaller, lowers itself toward the ground, arches its back and leans its body away from the threat rather than forward.  Fighting usually occurs only when escape is impossible.<ref name=\"Miller\" />\n*'''Confident posture''' \u2013 The cat may walk around in a more comfortable manner with its tail up to the sky indicating their importance. Cats often walk through houses with their tail standing up high above them making them look grander and more elegant.\n*'''Terrified posture''' \u2013 The cat is crouched directly on top of its paws, with visible shaking seen in some parts of the body. Its tail is close to the body, and it can be standing up, together with its hair at the back. The legs are very stiff or even bent to increase their size. Typically, cats avoid contact when they feel threatened, although they can resort to varying degrees of aggression when they feel cornered, or when escape is impossible.<ref>{{cite web|title=Reading Your Cat|url=http://animal.discovery.com/cat-guide/cat-behavior/reading-your-cat.html|publisher=Animal Planet|accessdate=22 December 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111121232348/http://animal.discovery.com/cat-guide/cat-behavior/reading-your-cat.html|archivedate=21 November 2011}}</ref>\n*'''Aggressive posture''' \u2013 The hind legs stiffen, the rump elevates but the back stays flat, tail hairs are erected, the nose is pushed forward and the ears are pulled back slightly.  Because cats have both claws and teeth, they can easily cause injury if they become involved in a fight, so this posture is an attempt to elicit deference by a competitor without fighting.  The aggressor may attempt to make challengers retreat and will pursue them if they do not flee. \n\n[[File:Abby playing in basket.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A [[tortoiseshell cat]] with erect hairs on its tail and back which in this context indicates excitement or curiosity]]\n\n===Ears===\nCats can change the position of their ears very quickly, in a continuum from erect when the cat is alert and focused, slightly relaxed when the cat is calm, and flattened against the head when extremely defensive or aggressive.<ref name=\"catwatch\" /> In cats, flattened ears generally indicate that an individual feels threatened and may attack.\n\nFlattening of the ears is also a biological adaptation for stalking prey in grass or in a hiding place where the cat's erect ears would give away its position.\n\n===Eyes===\nA direct stare by a cat usually communicates a challenge or threat and is more likely to be seen in high-ranking cats; lower-ranking cats usually withdraw in response.<ref name=\"Miller\" /> The direct stare is often used during [[predation]] or for territorial reasons.\n\nIn contrast to a direct stare, cats will lower their eyelids or slowly blink them to show trust and affection to their owners. According to Gary Weitzman, a licensed veterinarian and animal author, this type of feline body language is similar to a \"kitty kiss\". He further explains in his book, \"How To Speak Cat: A Guide to Decoding Cat Language,\" that slow blinking could be a physiological response to lowered stress hormonal levels from being in a calm state.\n\n\"The slow blink really is an acceptance gesture,\" Weitzman says. \"They do that when they're absolutely comfortable with you, and they do it with other cats as well.\" It is not clear why cats do this when they are feeling calm and comfortable, but Weitzman writes, \"it's likely an autonomic response \u2026 having to do with the cat having its cortisol [stress hormone] levels down.\"\n\nIn fact, Weitzman encourages cat owners to mimic this behavior to return not only a message of affection, but one that reinforces a nonthreatening position. This behavior is not exclusive to domestic house cats. Since cats can be very territorial, in the wild they utilize this slow blinking with other cats to signal themselves as friendly or nonthreatening.<ref>{{Cite book|title=How to speak cat : a guide to decoding cat language|last=Alexander|first=Newman, Aline|others=Weitzman, Gary|isbn=9781426318634|location=Washington, D.C.|oclc=880756959|year = 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Tail===\nCats often use their tails to communicate. A cat holding its tail vertically generally indicates positive emotions such as happiness or confidence; the vertical tail is often used as a friendly greeting toward human beings or other cats (usually close relatives).  A half-raised tail can indicate less pleasure, and unhappiness is indicated with a tail held low. In addition, a cat's tail may swing from side to side.  If this motion is slow and \"lazy\", it generally indicates that the cat is in a relaxed state.  Cats will twitch the tip of their tail when hunting or when otherwise alert or playful. Abrupt, full-tail twitching indicates a state of indecision.<!-- This isn't relevant to the scope of this article, but the example Morris uses is a cat who steps outside and discovers it's raining.

This tail behavior is also seen when a cat has become \"irritated\" and is nearing the point of lashing out, typically by biting or swatting with claws extended.  A cat may also twitch its tail when playing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iams.com/iams/pet-health/cat-body-language.jsp|title=Cat articles on Iams website|publisher=|access-date=2009-11-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100225152840/http://www.iams.com/iams/pet-health/cat-body-language.jsp|archive-date=2010-02-25|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nSometimes during play, a cat, or more commonly, a kitten, will raise the base of its tail high and stiffen all but the tip into a shape like an upside-down \"U\". This signals great excitement, to the point of hyperactivity. This may also be seen when younger cats chase each other, or when they run around by themselves. When greeting their owner, cats often hold their tails straight up with a quivering motion that indicates extreme happiness.<ref>{{cite web|title=Common Cat Behaviors|url=http://www.best-cat-tips.com/common_cat_behaviors.htm|work=Best Cat Tips|publisher=www.best-cat-tips.com|accessdate=28 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503205251/http://best-cat-tips.com/common_cat_behaviors.htm|archive-date=3 May 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>  A scared or surprised cat may erect the hairs on its tail and back.  In addition, it may stand more upright and turn its body sideways to increase its apparent size as a threat. Tailless cats, such as the [[Manx (cat)|Manx]], which possess only a small stub of a tail, move the stub around as if they have a full tail.\n\n==Tactile communication==\n\n=== Grooming ===\n[[File:Cat Self-Cleaning 1 2016-07-26.webm|thumb|alt=|Cat grooming itself.]]\nCats often lick other cats as [[allogrooming]] or to bond (this grooming is usually done between familiar cats). They also sometimes lick humans, which may indicate affection. \n\nOral grooming for domestic and feral cats is a common behavior; recent studies on domestic cats show that they spend about 8% of resting time grooming themselves. Grooming is extremely important not only to clean themselves but also to ensure ectoparasite control. Fleas tend to be the most common ectoparasite of cats and some studies allude to indirect evidence that grooming in cats is effective in dislodging fleas from the head and neck. Cats not only use their tongue for grooming to control ectoparasites, but also to scratch itchy areas of the body.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Eckstein | first1 = Robert A. | last2 = Hart | first2 = Benjamin L. | year = 2000 | title = Grooming and Control of Fleas in Cats | url = | journal = Applied Animal Behaviour Science | volume = 68 | issue = 2| pages = 141\u201350 | doi=10.1016/s0168-1591(00)00095-2| pmid = 10771322 }}</ref>\n\n===Kneading===\n[[File:Amasamiento de un gato.ogv|thumb|Classic kneading of a cat]]\nCats sometimes repeatedly tread their front paws on humans or soft objects with a [[Kneading (cats)|kneading action]].  This is instinctive to kittens and adults, and is presumably derived from the action used to stimulate milk let-down by the mother during nursing.  Kittens \"knead\" the breast while suckling, using the forelimbs one at a time in an alternating pattern to push against the mammary glands to stimulate lactation in the mother. Kneading may also have an origin going back to cats' wild ancestors who had to tread down grass or foliage to make a temporary nest in which to rest.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schwartz|first=Stefanie|date=2003|title=Separation anxiety syndrome in dogs and cats|journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association|language=en|volume=222|issue=11|pages=1526\u20131532|doi=10.2460/javma.2003.222.1526|pmid=12784957|issn=0003-1488|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7ea1f3d064138bcb48fbfede733dbf7e17bb905a}}</ref>\n\nCats carry these infantile behaviors beyond nursing and into adulthood. Some cats \"nurse,\" i.e. suck, on clothing or bedding during kneading. The cat exerts firm downwards pressure with its paw, spreading its toes to expose its claws, then curls its toes as it lifts its paw. The process takes place with alternate paws at intervals of one to two seconds. They may knead while sitting on their owner's lap, which may prove painful if the cat has sharp claws.\n\nSince most of the preferred \"domestic traits\" are [[Neoteny#Domestication|neotenous]] or juvenile traits that persist in the adult, kneading may be a relic juvenile behavior retained in adult domestic cats.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Schwartz|first1=Stefanie|title=Separation anxiety syndrome in dogs and cats|journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association|date=June 2003|volume=222|issue=11|pages=1526\u201332|accessdate=|doi=10.2460/javma.2003.222.1526|pmid=12784957|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7ea1f3d064138bcb48fbfede733dbf7e17bb905a}}</ref> It may also [[stimulate]] the cat and make it feel good, in the same manner as a human [[stretching]]. Kneading is often a precursor to [[sleep]]ing. Many cats [[purr]] while kneading, usually taken to indicate contentment and affection. They also purr mostly when newborn, when feeding, or when trying to feed on their mother's teat. The common association between the two behaviors may corroborate the evidence in favor of the origin of kneading as a remnant instinct.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=McPherson|first1=F.J|last2=Chenoweth|first2=P.J|title=Mammalian sexual dimorphism|journal=Animal Reproduction Science|date=April 2012|volume=131|issue=3\u20134|pages=109\u2013122|accessdate=|doi=10.1016/j.anireprosci.2012.02.007|pmid=22482798}}</ref>\n\nCats have scent glands on the underside of their paws.  When they knead or scratch objects or people, it is likely these [[pheromones]] are transferred to the person or object being kneaded or scratched.\n\n===Bunting===\nSome cats rub their faces on humans, apparently as a friendly greeting or indicating affection. This tactile action is combined with olfactory communication as the contact leaves scent from glands located around the mouth and cheeks.

Unlike a [[dog's penis]], a [[cat's penis]] points backward. Although cats may mark with both sprayed and non-sprayed urine, the spray is usually more thick and oily than normally deposited urine, and may contain additional secretions from anal sacs that help the sprayer to make a stronger communication.  While cats mark their territory both by rubbing of the scent glands and by urine and fecal deposits, spraying seems to be the \"loudest\" feline olfactory statement. It is most frequently observed in intact male cats in competition with other males. Males neutered in adulthood may still spray after neutering.  Female cats also sometimes spray.<ref name=\"Miller\" />\n\nA cat that urinates outside the litter box may indicate dissatisfaction with the box, due to a variety of factors such as substrate texture, cleanliness and privacy. It can also be a sign of [[Feline lower urinary tract disease|urinary tract problems]]. Male cats on poor diets are susceptible to crystal formation in the urine which can block the urethra and create a medical emergency.\n\nThe urine of mature male cats in particular contains the [[amino acid]] known as [[felinine]] which is a precursor to [[3-mercapto-3-methylbutan-1-ol]] (MMB), the sulfur-containing compound that gives cat urine its characteristically strong odor. Felinine is produced in the urine from 3-methylbutanol-cysteinylglycine (3-MBCG) by the excreted [[peptidase]] [[cauxin]].

This can go on for some time until one cat does not get up again and remains seated.<ref name=\":13\" /> The defeated cat does not move until the victor has completed a sniff of the area and moves outside the fighting area. Once this happens, the defeated cat leaves the area, ending the duel.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nFemales may also fight with each other. If a male and female do not get along, they may also fight. Cats may need to be reintroduced or separated to avoid fights in a closed household.\n\n=== Socialization with humans ===\nCats between the age of three and nine weeks are sensitive to [[Human interaction with cats|human socialization]].<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|title=The Domestic Cat: The Biology of its Behaviour|last=Turner|first=Dennis C.|last2=Bateson|first2=Patrick|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1988|isbn=978-0-521-35447-9|location=Cambridge|pages=[https://archive.org/details/domesticcatbiolo0000unse/page/112 112\u2013113, 159\u2013168]|url=https://archive.org/details/domesticcatbiolo0000unse/page/112}}</ref> After this period, socialization can be less effective.<ref name=\":62\">{{Cite book|title=The Welfare of Cats|last=Bernstein|first=Penny L.|publisher=Springer, Dordrecht|year=2007|isbn=978-1-4020-3227-1|location=|pages=47\u201389|chapter=The Human-Cat Relationship}}</ref> Studies have shown that the earlier the kitten is handled, the less fearful the kitten will be towards humans.<ref name=\":62\" /> Other factors that can enhance socialization are having many people handle the kitten frequently, the presence of the mother, and feeding.<ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":62\" /> The presence of the mother is important because cats are observational learners.

If the handler can get a cat to urinate in the litter tray, then the others in a litter will usually follow. Initial contact with thick gloves is highly recommended until trust is established, usually within the first week. It is a challenge to socialize an adult. Socialized adult feral cats tend to trust only those who they trusted in their socialization period, and therefore can be very fearful around strangers.<ref name=\"auto2\" />\n\nThere are a number of problematic behaviours that affect the human\u2013cat relationship. One behaviour is when cats attack people by clawing and biting.<ref name=\":32\"/> This often occurs spontaneously or could be triggered by sudden movements.<ref name=\":32\"/> Another problematic behaviour is the \"petting and biting syndrome\", which involves the cat being petted and then suddenly attacking and running away.<ref name=\":32\"/> Other problems are house soiling, scratching furniture, and when a cat brings dead prey into the house.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|title=The Welfare of Cats|last=Heath|first=Sarah E.|publisher=Springer, Dordrecht|year=2007|isbn=978-1-4020-3227-1|location=|pages=91\u2013107|chapter=Behaviour Problems and Welfare}}</ref> It is these kinds of behaviours that put a strain on the socialization between cats and people.\n\nThere are fifty-two measured cat personality traits in cats, with one study suggesting \"five reliable personality factors were found using principal axis factor analysis: neuroticism, extroversion, dominance, impulsiveness and agreeableness.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Roetman|first=Philip|last2=Kikillus|first2=K.
